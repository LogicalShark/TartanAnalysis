Two days after the New Year, 
Port Authority Transit announced 
its plan to eliminate more than half 
of all bus routes that are currently 
serving the city of Pittsburgh by 
June 2007. Weekday routes will be 
reduced from 213 to 92, Saturday 
routes from 100 to 45, and Sunday 
routes from 75 to 39. The worst cut 
for Carnegie Mellon students may 
be the 28X, also known as the air
port flyer.
The proposed plan was cre
ated in hopes of taking the city of 
Pittsburgh out of its current transit 
crisis. All of the citys emergency 
funding was exhausted at the end 
of December 2006. By next fiscal 
year, the Port Authority anticipates
an operating deficit of between 
$75 and $80 million, according 
to a statement by Steve Bland, the 
Port Authoritys CEO.
For the last decade, the city of 
Pittsburgh has depended on state 
funding to support its transit sys
tem because it was unable to create 
a self-sufficient transit system that 
could meet Pittsburghers needs. 
The last four years have been the 
most severe, according to a study 
released recently by the Pennsyl
vania Transportation Funding and 
Reform Commission. Committees 
have held public hearings to dis
cuss the possible changes in Febru
ary 2005, July 2005, and August 
2006.
A new round qf public hearings 
begins today at 10 a.m. at the Pitts
burgh Hilton Hotel, located at 600 
Commonwealth Place downtown.
.a*. ajAflito -r jvSince the problem became ap
parent 10 years ago, concerned 
citizens have formed groups, such 
as Save Our Transit, demanding 
dedicated funding and working 
hard to avoid the proposed cuts. 
The volunteers at Save Our Transit 
have spent years attending hear
ings in Harrisburg to voice com
plaints, as well as writing letters, 
sending faxes, and making phone 
calls to the Pennsylvania General 
Assembly and Governor Edward 
G. Rendell.
Today, group members will 
be holding a march and rally to 
voice their anger against officials. 
Gathering at 8:30 a.m. at Mellon 
Square, the rally will begin at 8:45. 
The march will begin at 9:15 a.m., 
ending at the Pittsburgh Hilton in

Service opportunities for every season
How to make a difference year round now that the holidays are over
by Sabrina Porter
Junior Staffwriter
Although the holidays have 
ended, a new season of service 
has just begun. Below are some 
ways to make a difference this 
week and all year round.
The Office of Student Devel
opment is hoping to collect be
tween 700 and 800 handmade 
valentines to distribute to senior 
citizens in local nursing homes. 
Students, faculty, and staff are 
invited to create their own cards 
and drop them off at the Of
fice of Student Development in
Morewood Gardens by Friday, 
February 9. Volunteers are also 
needed to distribute the cards 
Friday, February 9, through Sun
day, February 11, at local nursing 
homes.
Tomorrow, the American Red 
Cross will be hosting a blood 
drive in Rangos Hall in the Uni
versity Center from 9:30 a.m. to 
3:30 p.m. The event is sponsored 
by the brothers of Pi Kappa Al
pha and the Office of Student 
Development. No appointments 
are needed and walk-ins are wel
come. More information can be 
found at www.redcrosslife.org.
On Friday, the sisters of Delta
Delta Delta will be hosting the 
Second Annual Twister Tourna
ment. All proceeds will benefit 
St. Judes Childrens Hospital for 
Cancer Research. The tourna
ment will be held in Rangos from
9 to 11 p.m.
People should support the 
cause because St. Jude is simply 
an amazing organization.... They 
help to save the lives of thousands 
of children and are leading the 
way in finding a cure for child
hood cancer, said sophomore 
psychology major Jess Jankowitsch, the philanthropic chair of 
Delta Delta Delta and coordina
tor of the event.
The East End Youth Projects, 
a student-run organization that 
goes to local schools to tutor chil
dren, is seeking new volunteers 
to visit children once a week for 
about two hours. Currently, they 
are involved in Sterrett Classical 
Academys after-school program 
,helping students with math
ematics. Transportation is pro
vided.
I am able to have an impact 
on the students and see them 
improve every week, said junior 
biology major Samantha Spath, 
president of East End. I know

Campus day of events 
celebrates life ofMLK
Professor receives grant to research book
by Claire Morgenstern
News Editor
Students, staff, faculty, and 
community members came to
gether last Monday to celebrate 
the legacy of Martin Luther 
King Jr. They didnt come just 
to honor the past; many of the 
days events also focused on how 
to implement Kings vision in 
the present and future Carnegie 
Mellon community.
University President Jared 
Cohon began the days pro
gram with his annual State of 
Diversity at Carnegie Mellon 
presentation. In particular, Co
hon focused on the presence of 
the African-American and His
panic communities on campus. 
He reported that the number of 
African-American and Hispanic 
students enrolled in the class 
of 2010 was larger than in pre
vious years, about 5.4 percent. 
However, while the overall firstyear attrition rate has declined, 
minority first-year attrition has 
actually increased.
Cohon attributed this increase 
in the number of minority stu
dents transferring after their 
first year to the lack of available 
financial aid that Carnegie Mel
lon can offer its students.
We cannot meet the financial 
need of many of our students, 
he said. Other schools are offer
ing more money.
Cohon praised the work of 
the Diversity Advisory Council 
(DAC), now in its ninth year. The 
groups goals for this year are 
to enroll more minority under
graduate students and to place 
more minorities in senior staff 
positions within the university.
In addition, Cohon presented 
Everett Tademy with the Barbara 
Lazarus Award for Culture and 
Climate. The award is presented 
annually to a staff or faculty 
member who has made note
worthy contributions toward 
creating a campus environment 
that is both supportive and di
verse. Tademy is the assistant 
vice president for Diversity and 
Equal Opportunity Services.
Later in the afternoon, Tademy 
led the community conversation 
titled Opportunity. Justice. 
Pittsburgh? Is Kings Vision Rel
evant in 2007? The program 
featured a panel of seven men 
and women who have helped 
nurture and improve some of 
Pittsburghs most distressed 
neighborhoods.
These folks are in the busi
ness of creating opportunities 
for people, Tademy said.
The panelists were Terri Bal

neighborhood development,

History professor Scott Sandage will spend next year researching his new 
book with a grant from the National Endowment of the Humanities.
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
The bad news is that associate 
history professor Scott Sandage 
will be on sabbatical next year. 
The good news is that hell be 
spending the time doing re
search for a new book, thanks to a 
$40,000 grant from the National 
Endowment of the Humanities 
(NEH).
The book, Half-Breed Creek: 
A Tall Tale of Race on the Fron
tier; 1804-1941, will explore the 
cultural history of mixed-race 
identity. The money will finance 
visits to archives and other his
torical sites that relate to his 
research.
Sandages project is centered 
on a little-known half-breed 
Native American reservation in 
southeast Nebraska in the 19th 
and 20th centuries.
It is a fascinating family saga. 
Because of the inherent interest 
in a story of generations of fam
ily, it should resonate with com
mon readers and scholars alike, 
one member of the National 
Endowment Committee wrote 
on Sandages application for the 
grant.
The fellowship is highly com
petitive. According to NEH 
officials, there were 161 awards 
for 1507 applicants. In addi
tion to these individual awards,
118 institutions received fund
ing. Overall, $10.7 million was 
awarded.
Its a rigorous process where 
we examine applications again 
and again. We like to think that 
the awards are given to the best 
of the best, said Noel Milan, 
the media representative for the 
NEH.
Sandage came to Carnegie 
Mellon in 1996 after earning his 
Ph.D. in history from Rutgers 
University. He teaches one large 
lecture undergraduate survey 
course of U.S. history as well as 
courses on individualism, politi
cal humor, and one very popular 
course on the roots of rock and 
roll. However, the majority of 
his research concerns identity in 
America.
This fellowship represents a 
certification that Scott is onto a 
groundbreaking set of issues in 
identity formation. He is dealing 
with race in the most complicated 
form, said Joe Trotter, Mellon 
professor of history and depart
ment head. Its not just about 
whites and blacks, but whites, 
blacks, and Native Americans. 
Its about their intersection and 
an important moment in national 
history. We are really proud of 
this fellowship and of Scott for 
having received it.

decison sciences major Rosalyce Broadous-Brown, who urged students to take action to ensure that 
the civil rights movement continues to make progress in alleviating racial injustice.
While the United States has become a more racially integrated country 
in the 39 years since Martin Luther King Jr.s assassination, theres still 
progress to be made. In honor of his 78th birthday, the following statis

Robotics and Middle East lectures this week
by Claire Morgenstem
News Editor
This week, the University 
Lecture Series will provide two 
events that are at opposite ends 
of the disciplinary spectrum. 
Carnegie Mellon robotics pro
fessor Ralph Hollis will speak 
about the Robotics Institutes 
development of ballbots, ro
bots that are able to act and 
move in a manner more simi
lar to humans. Meanwhile, 
Israeli storyteller Noa Baum 
will also seek to bridge a gap, 
not between robots and hu
mans, but between Israelis and 
Palestinians. Her performance 
will combine the political his
tories and personal memories 
of both groups in an attempt to 
forge unity between them.
Hollis will present a lecture 
on Thursday tided Ballbot: A 
New Locomotion Technology 
for Mobile Robots. He will 
discuss the Robotics Institutes 
plan to develop robots with the 
height, width, weight, and bal
ance capabilities of a person. 
The field has been previously 
unstudied, and Hollis is one of 
its pioneers. Such a machine 
will be able to transcend the 
physical limitations that af
fect current robots, which have 
wider bases, lower centers of 
gravity, and lower accelerations 
that prevent them from being 
able to move through doorways 
and around larger objects.
Hollis will discuss the overall 
design and mechanics of the 
robots as well as plans for future 
enhancements.

and the Middle East Peace 
Forum of Pittsburgh.
Executive
Privilege
Change is good 
for a newspaper
Shawn Wertz
When I came to Carnegie Mellon al
most three years ago, I came in hopes of 
advancing myself. That isnt to say that 
I came looking to change myself, but I 
did want to progress toward being a dif
ferent, more prepared individual when 
it came time to seek employment.
Now, in the process of completing 
my junior year, I realize that change 
is perhaps a more prevalent factor 
than I originally thought. And I now 
agree with famed American historian 
and Pittsburgh native Henry Steele 
Commager when he said, Change does 
not necessarily assure progress, but 
progress implacably requires change.
At the risk of being redundant, Im a 
fan of change. Not radical change, mind 
you, but slow and steady change that 
alters objects, perceptions, and institu
tions over time, much like the process 
of evolution. In many ways, humans are 
encouraged to constantly better them
selves, mostly through education and 
employment. And while going to col
lege or getting a job certainly isnt an 
upheaval of all things familiar, people 
definitely evolve as a result of having 
new experiences.
And heres where I reel you in by say
ing that newspapers are at the root of 
all human existence.
Not really, but in many aspects, one 
could consider producing a newspaper 
much like having a child. By saying 
this, I dont mean to degrade the experi
ence mothers have by comparing their 
children to a publication. Of course, 
there is no physical pain involved with 
producing a newspaper, aside from a 
nasty paper cut every now and then. 
And, most evidendy, we arent giving 
another human being life.
But a well-thought-out newspaper 
has a gestation period of its own. 
Throughout the week, our editors de
cide what stories to write and how 
the newspaper should be designed. A 
newspaper also requires a lot of money 
to keep it thriving, not to mention a 
dedicated family to see it flourish.
When produced well, a newspaper 
can speak to people as much as any 
flesh-and-blood individual can. To some 
readers, what a newspaper has to say 
could be a lot more important to them 
than what their friends have to say.
And as I continue to produce the 
newspaper after almost two years on 
staff, theres both a sense of accomplish
ment, and a feeling of nervousness. Like 
a parent leaving his child for his or her 
first day of school, I worry, can it make 
the grade? Will all of the kids like it?
Newspapers dont always play in a 
friendly sandbox. Today, a college news
paper faces the challenge of addressing 
a visually-based audience bombarded 
with shinier, more colorful things by 
much larger media outlets like The New 
York Times and Newsweek.
Eventually, newspapers may find that 
the websites theyve been producing 
on the side will become their primary 
outlet for content.
So where does The Tartan fit in? For 
starters, our campus has a fantastic 
mixture of talented scientists, writers, 
engineers, business men and women, 
and performers. My goal is to make our 
news accessible to students and profes
sors of all concentrations.
Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon is no
torious for being primarily electroni
cally based. This means that when 
people want their news, they prefer 
to read it on a computer monitor than 
on paper. We have to make our cur
rent award-winning website even bet
ter. The Tartan may print weekly, but 
we are planning to start offering online 
exclusives throughout the week.
By instituting these changes, The 
Tartan will, hopefully, mature. And af
ter celebrating its 100th birthday this 
year, I think its time.
Shawn Wertz, publisher of The Tartan, 
welcomes all responsible questions and 
comments, which may be sent to publisher@thetartan.org.

PAT services face cutbacks
TRANSIT, from Al
time for the first public hearing.
The group hopes to see a turnout of several 
hundred people.
Amanda Zeiders, a 2005 graduate of the 
University of Pittsburgh who organized the 
rally, is upset that the city is still planning to 
implement the cuts regardless of whether or 
not Harrisburg provides sufficient funds.
I have fought for six years for reliable fund
ing in order to prevent cuts, Zeiders said. 
The fact that local elected leaders refuse to 
ask for money is a major disappointment.
But reliable funding means more than just 
a steady check.
A growing source of funding is meant 
to grow with the economy as the economy 
grows. If we would have had such funding
10 years ago; we wouldnt be in this mess, 
Zeiders said.
The cuts would cause all riders to suffer 
economically, Zeiders continued. Without 
transportation to work, people will have to 
move or change jobs. Those who can afford 
cars will start driving to work, causing more 
traffic and pollution. Parents will have to 
leave earlier for work and return home later, 
meaning more money spent on child care and 
less time with their families.
Our quality of living will go down, Zeiders 
said. This plan affects the lives of so many 
people. Its horrible.
This plan will also affect students. Cuts 
will even be made to the routes that remain. 
Buses will arrive less often, which means less 
space and longer waits in the snow. Commut
ing students may find themselves walking or 
taking roundabout routes to class. In addition 
to the 28X, another route headed for elimina
tion is the 500 Highland Park-Bellevue, one 
of the routes used often by students to get 
from Oakland to downtown.
The proposed changes will limit students 
activities, including outreach efforts.
Public transportation is a key method for 
students to reach out to the greater Pitts
burgh community, said Asako Hayashi, 
community advisor for Mudge House. These 
' cuts will cause students to depend on ex
pensive means to get around. RAs will need 
to use cars to bring students out for cultural 
events. Using a car can be fne on some occa
sions, but when you have 30 or so people you 
need to take for a volunteering event or to the 
museum, it becomes unfeasible.
For Sterling Berliant, a first-year in H&SS, 
the bus has helped her adapt to life in Pitts
burgh.
[Riding the bus] allowed me to feel like a 
part of the Pittsburgh community. With the 
elimination of bus routes like the 28X, there 
will be a disconnect between CMU students 
and the community, she said.
Although the Port Authority has stated its 
intent to cut services no matter what, people 
can still avoid opinions by sending e-mails to 
the Port Authority, calling its comment line 
at (412) 566-5335, attending hearings, and 
creating web pages.
This needs to become well known on cam
pus, Hayashi said. Students need to seek 
out interested parties and fight against these 
changes.
Fortunately, the changes may be tempo
rary. The Port Authority plans to engage the 
community in a Transit Development Plan 
that will assess the role of public transpor
tation in Allegheny County in the hopes of 
rebuilding the system over several years, ac
cording to the public hearing brochure issued 
by the authority.

SERVICE, from A1
know that our help is really ap
preciated at the school.
This semester, East End is 
hoping to start up a pen-pal pro
gram in which correspondence 
between the children and CMU 
students is brought back and 
forth from campus to the school 
every two weeks. Those wish
ing to get involved in either of 
East Ends programs are invited 
to e-mail Spath at sspath@ or at 
east-end@.
Tutors are also needed to assist
with the Girls Hope of Pittsburgh, 
3 group of local underprivileged 
elementary school students. The 
girls are in need of tutors as well 
as mentors who would be in
terested in babysitting, having 
dinner, or driving the girls to ap
pointments and events. For more 
information, contact Kristen 
Wolford, the head of the organi
zation, at kwolford@bhgh.org.
The Office of Student De
velopment organizes Service 
Saturdays two or three times a 
month that offer the opportunity 
for Carnegie Mellon students to
join together and perform service 
in the community. The events 
have already been planned for 
February and March. Those who 
are interested can contact Kristy 
Kang at sinhyek@.
In addition, Habitat for Hu
manity offers service trips over 
winter and spring breaks to com
munities throughout the United 
States. Over winter break, a group 
of students traveled to Wash
ington, D.C. The trip planned 
for spring break will be to Lee 
County, Florida, where the 
group will be building houses
for underprivileged families in

Campus News in Brief
Black student grad rate still low
According to a January 10 
press release by the Journal 
of Blacks in Higher Educa
tion, Carnegie Mellons black 
student graduation rate is 67 
percent, the lowest among 
top universities. In cpntrast, 
the Journal reported a 84 
percent graduation rate for 
white students. The report 
was a follow-up to an article 
in the publications fall issue 
on black student enrollment 
at top American universities, 
which evaluated Carnegie 
Mellon and other institutions 
based on acceptance rate, re
tention rate, and percentage 
of black first-years.
The press release claimed 
that the universitys heavy 
emphasis on science could be 
a factor in the relatively low 
graduation rate of black stu
dents.
Bruce Slater, editor at the 
Journal, believes that schol
arships ending after the 
first year may also have pre
vented black students from 
completing school, accord
ing to a January 11 article in 
the Pittsburgh Post Gazette . 
However, Slater noted that 
the university has improved 
by 20 percent since 1998, the 
second-highest improvement 
for all the schools surveyed.
Nationally, the black stu
dent graduation rate is 43 
percent. The Journal defines 
the national rate as the per
centage of the members of the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Associations Division I who 
graduate within six years.

Sandage receives grant
GRANT, from Al
tive American reservation.
[The reservation] became 
a place that was used to de
cide whether your biology or 
your culture defines your race, 
Sandage said. The issue is still 
alive today; the year 2000 was 
the first time you could report 
yourself as mixed-race to the 
United States census bureau.
One of the first inhabitants 
of the reservation was Antoine 
Barada, the son of a French 
trapper and an Omaha In
dian woman. Barada became 
a legendary figure in Nebraska 
folklore, but Sandage is focusing 
on questions that arose about 
the Barada familys racial iden
tity. In the late 1800s, a court 
case involviftg the family consid
ered whether biology or culture 
defines a persons race. The U.S. 
Supreme Court decided in 1904 
that the Baradas were culturally 
white, despite their Indian an
cestry. Ironically, poverty kept
them sharecropping on the res
ervation for another 35 years.
Half-Breed Creek is not 
Sandages first book. In 2005, 
Harvard University Press pub
lished Born Losers: A History of 
Failure in America, which won 
the 2005 Wilson Prize as the 
best book by a first-time author 
for Harvard University Press.
For many years, we were 
involved in social history, or 
history from the bottom up. And 
were still doing that, but what 
Scott represents is maturation 
towards more cultural sensitiv
ity in the history field, Trotter 
said. Its a trend that represents 
the newer generation among 
scholars of history.
Winning this fellowship im
proves what has already been 
a successful academic year for 
Sandage. Last May, he was rec
ognized with the Elliot Dunlap 
Smith Teaching Award. The 
award is given by H&SS. The 
recipient is chosen based on rat
ings from students and faculty.

But the achievement gap is 
not just about education. While 
Pittsburgh promotes itself as

Carnegie Mellons Robotics 
Institute recently developed 
software to be used in a deepsea exploration project called 
DepthX.
Deep Phreatic Thermal
Explorer (DepthX) is a mis
sion to deploy an autonomous 
underwater vehicle (AUV) to 
the bottom of Zacaton Cenote, a 
sinkhole in central Mexico over 
1000 feet deep.
Dr. David Wettergreen of 
Carnegie Mellons Robotics 
Institute developed the robots 
navigational software. Wettergreens past research has fo
cused on robotics exloration, but 
this is his first underwater mis
sion with Carnegie Mellon.
Wettergreen said that the 
projects ultimate goal is to 
study the sinkholes underwater 
environment by collecting wa
ter samples while also creating 
a three-dimensional map of the 
sinkhole.
We need a vehicle...that can 
move through complex cave 
systems without getting lost or 
trapped, said Wettergreen.
The vehicle is seven feet in 
diameter, and it can spin and 
move in any direction. Also, its 
buoyancy is very high, and the 
center of mass is very low, mak
ing it ideal for underwater explo
ration. It really wants to float 
upright in the water  it turns 
out to be extremely stable, Wet
tergreen said.
In the DepthX project, Wet
tergreen helped develop soft
ware that enables the robot to 
map its environment. This par
ticular kind of software is called 
simultaneous localization and 
mapping, or SLAM.
Project leader and Pittsburgh 
native Bill Stone of Stone Aero
space said that in the bottom of 
Zacaton Cenote, things get very 
complicated, very fast. He said 
that SLAM is a clever way to de
termine the vehicles location 
because it allows the vehicle to 
build a map of its three-dimen
sional surroundings. The map
also includes information on the 
waters temperature and salinity 
levels.
Wettergreen said that previ
ous explorations into Zacatone 
Cenote have not gone deeper 
than 30 meters. Nonetheless, 
these exploration missions have 
turned up some interesting re
sults. In particular, the water 
contains low amounts of dis
solved oxygen, and the waters 
temperature is unusually warm 
 90F. Wettergreen said that 
DepthX may provide some data 
that explains these findings.
In May of 2005, the robotics 
team tested the vehicles sonar 
equipment in Mexico. Accord
ing to the teams field report, 
the sonar successfully reached 
from wall to wall, and research
ers were able to confirm that the 
sinkhole neither widens nor nar
rows at a depth of 200 meters.
This spring, the team plans 
to reach the bottom of the sink
hole. Wettergreen said that there 
could be life much deeper in the 
sinkhole.
Wettergreen said, Probably,
well find various kinds of slime 
and thats what well be sam
pling, but no one really knows, 
this is really exploration into the 
unknown.
If successful, DepthX might 
provide researchers with the 
tools that they need for robotics 
exploration elsewhere. In Ant
arctica, for instance, researchers 
are hoping to deploy the vehicle 
under perched lakes (lakes that 
are sealed off by a layer of ice).
Its more than just going from 
A to B to C to D, Wettergreen 
said. You need a model for what 
measurements are more impor
tant than others.
The robot could also be used 
to explore Jupiters ice-covered 
moon Europa. Stone said that a 
half-dozen planets have bodies 
of water that could contain life.
The software technology can 
be applied to a number of under
water exploration problems, 
Wettergreen said.
Stone said that an envi
ronment must contain water,

Doctors explore 
womb transplants
A group of New York doctors 
may be able to provide womb 
transplants to women unable to 
bear children.
After six months of study, 
doctors determined that it is 
medically possible to harvest the 
womb of a deceased donor. Be
fore surgery, the embryo of the 
recipient is removed and frozen 
for preservation. The transplant 
surgery involves an incision in 
the lower abdomen of the recipi
ent. Following this procedure, 
the embryo is returned to the 
patient and placed in the new 
womb. After the birth, the uterus 
is surgically removed to avoid 
the possibility of rejection.

Amnesia patients 
stuck in the present
Research by scientists at 
the Wellcome Trust Centre 
for Neuroimaging at Univer
sity College London suggests 
that people who damage their 
hippocampus may have difficul
ties perceiving future scenarios.
The hippocampus is a portion 
of the brain involved in the pro
cesses of learning and forming 
memories. The patients studied, 
who had damaged hippocampuses, had difficulty narrating 
future situations, such as a hypo
thetical picnic or day at the beach.
Doctors found that patients 
were unable to mentally visual
ize a scene. They could envision 
separate components of a scene 
but were unable to put them to
gether. These findings suggest 
that sufferers of amnesia have no 
choice but to live in the present, 
and that the hippocampus has a 
more significant function in the 
brain than previously thought.

Multi-tasking may 
be impossible
Doctors Paul E. Dux and 
Ren Marois, two neuroscien
tists working out of Vanderbilt 
University, have uncovered 
new evidence that the hu
man brain may lack the ability 
to perform two tasks at once.
Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI), 
scientists observed the neu
ral activity of participants who 
were asked to simultaneously 
push a button when they saw a 
certain image and speak when 
they heard a certain a noise.
Scientists found that the 
brain queues one task after an
other, instead of doing both 
at once. These results suggest 
that the brairi must queue tasks 
that involve different senses.

How Things Work: Cochlear Implants
Jun Xian Leong
Superhuman hearing is usually some
thing left to comic books, movies, and 
even fantasies of a more-advanced, fu
ture human race.
But this seemingly impossible fu
ture prospect is not as far away as you 
may think. Cochlear implants are one 
of the newest advancements in the bi
onic augmentation of human hearing. 
These devices are still in the develop
ment phase, but even the earliest ver
sions of cochlear implants have success
fully restored hearing to people who 
were once deaf.
Conventional hearing aids are simply 
crude sound amplifiers mounted out
side the ear. Cochlear implants func
tion in a somewhat more sophisticated 
way. Cochlear implants are essentially 
microphones connected directly to the 
auditory nerve endings within the ear, 
transmitting electrical impulses to the 
nerve endings whenever sound is de
tected. Hence, these devices interface 
directly with the brain, causing the sen
sation of hearing.
In essence, a cochlear implant repli
cates the function of the cochlea, which 
is the primary organ for detecting sound 
within the ear. The cochlea is composed 
of a long spiral of tissue covered with 
nerve endings. Sound that enters the 
ear travels along this tissue, creating vi
brations that are picked up by the nerve 
cells connected to it. Low-frequency 
sounds travel much farther along the 
tissue than high-frequency sounds, and 
correspondingly, different nerve sec
tions along the cochlea deliver impulses 
that are interpreted by the brain as dif
ferent frequencies.
Inserting the implant itself involves 
disconnecting the. biological cochlea
to expose the nerves for connections, 
hence destroying any form of hearing 
the person might have originally pos
sessed. This is the main reason why tests 
have been strictly limited to those who 
already have severe hearing losses and 
no other means of hearing. As less than 
one percent of deaf people have actually
brain and spinal chord. Meningitis and 
facial paralysis are also possible dan
gers, although these are largely due to 
the surgical procedure rather than the 
implant itself.
Once implanted, the cochlear implant 
is directly hooked up to these nerve cells 
in place of the cochlea. Tiny electrical

suffered damages to the auditory nerve, 
they are currently the only viable candi
dates for such techniques.
Apart from that, another danger that 
is associated with cochlear implants is 
cerebrospinal fluid leakage, which is a 
leakage of the fluid that surrounds the
impulses are generated by the implant 
when any sound is detected, stimulating 
the appropriate set of nerves, which then 
transmit information to the brain.
Current models of cochlear implants, 
however, are far from achieving the 
hearing quality of real cochlea. The electrodes used by the implant to stimulate 
the nerve endings cannot accurately 
mimic the signals created by the original 
auditory nerve, causing most sounds to 
be initially heard as little more than in
comprehensible noise.
Fortunately, scientists are discovering 
that the brain is much more adapt
able to these implants than previously 
thought. As the brain learns to accept 
the new input, it acquires the ability to 
differentiate between various sounds 
and can even begin recognizing speech. 
Combined with lip-reading techniques, 
cochlear implants have successfully 
returned above-average speech recogni
tion in many adults.
Of course, the question remains: 
Would cochlear implants truly be able 
to grant us super-hearing someday in 
the future? In principle, yes. Just like the 
volume on a microphone can be tuned up 
or down, the sensitivity of the cochlear 
implant could theoretically be adjusted 
for such applications. Similarly, it would 
not be hard to modulate frequencies re
ceived so that we might one day be able 
to hear sounds outside of human audi
tory range, such as ultrasonic squeaks or 
subsonic tremors.
This implant thus opens up a whole 
new world of possibilities for the human 
ear. People with the current form of co
chlear implants have reported hearing a 
buzzing noise produced by electromag
netic fields, such as metal detectors or 
MRI scanners.
If designed specifically for this task, 
it is conceivable that one day cochlear 
implants may reveal to us entirely novel 
forms of communication. This might be
gin with implanted radios or cell phones 
and concievably culminate in bionic im
plants that transmit brainwaves in psy
chic communication.

For the second consecutive 
year, the number of deaths

1 percent. Researchers say this 
drop in deaths could be the 
start of a downward trend re
sulting from improvements 
in detection of cancers and 
broader anti-smoking cam

Experts also attribute this 
decline in cancer deaths to im

Urban farming provides a possible solution to global climate change and food shortages

Consumers in large cities of
ten hear of Florida-grown or
anges or Idaho potatoes. But in 
a time when the worlds climate 
is sometimes unstable, city 
shoppers might find themselves 
purchasing products grown a 
lot closer to home.
In the first of four lectures 
called Urban Farming  Re
connecting Our Farms, Food, 
and Community, David Jacke, 
author of Edible Forest Gardens, 
spoke in Rangos last Thursday 
about the advantages of urban 
food forests in a world where cli
mate change and global warm
ing may transform our lives.
Jacke referred to these prob
lems as humanitys quadruple 
threat, which consists of a ris
ing global population of about 
77 million people per year, 
global climate change, destruc
tion of the earths habitat, and 
high oil production.
Jacke said that global warm
ing has caused the Arctic ice 
shelf to melt, putting polar 
bears in danger. In particular, 
large pieces of ice are shrinking 
and drifting apart, forcing polar 
bears to swim up to 60 miles in' 
the sea to find food.
In an online publication by 
Canadas Office of Urban Agri
culture, President of the Urban 
Agriculture Network Jac Smit 
discussed some of urban farm
ings benefits. In particular, 
urban farming reduces the use 
of chemical fertilizers because 
urban farmers use urban waste 
as fertilizer. It also reduces the 
amount of pollution produced 
from shipping food products 
across the world.
Jacke said that the goal of 
urban food forests is to pro
duce high, diverse yields of 
different plant species, to have 
a self-maintaining and ecologi
cally healthy food forest, and 
to improve economic stability.

on profile-based social network
ing sites, such as Myspace.com. 
Sometimes these accounts pres
ent false data.
They are [on it], and they are 
listed as the 99-year-olds, said 
Kraemer. Were trying to change 
their behavior by teaching them 
to reason, she explained.
Instead of simply telling its 
users not to give out personal
information on the Internet, 
Carnegie Cadets stresses the 
potential consequences of doing 
so through the use of concrete 
examples.
For example, children learn 
that if they share their addresses 
or even list locations close to 
where they live, a stranger could 
use that information to show up 
at their houses.
In the information-sharing 
minigame, the player is a bouncer 
at a night club, which represents 
a chat room. The objective is to 
turn away users asking for per
sonal information, in addition to 
those offering it.
During the corresponding 
quest, the player interacts with 
a character in the game; she has 
accidentally shared some per
sonal information in a chat room 
and needs advice. The character 
explains her dilemma through a 
series of speech bubbles appear
ing on the screen.

When talking to the other 
characters, children can choose 
from about four responses, some 
of which are more correct than 
others. The format is similar to 
that of a role-playing computer 
game.
Each quest contains several 
rounds of dialogue, including an 
initial setup where children can 
choose how to greet the other 
character. This way, the exercise 
has the feel of a conversation, not 
a quiz.
One of the reasons that it is so 
important for schools to teach 
children about the Internet is 
that their students come from a 
wide variety of backgrounds.
The range is incredible, said 
Kraemer. In the fourth and fifth 
grade, some kids lack even a fam
ily computer, while others might 
have them in their bedrooms.
I think it would be great for 
parents to go through with their 
kids, Strzempek-said, who ad
mitted that Pennsylvania has a 
weak curriculum for online edu
cation. \
At some point, they have to 
make conscious decisions on 
their own.
Carnegie Cadets endows its 
player with the authority to make 
educated choices. While playing 
the game, children feel that they 
are in charge. They control what 
they say to other characters in 
addition to how they spend their 
earned rewards.
Though the purpose of Carn
egie Cadets is to inform its users 
about the dangers of the Inter
net, its creators tried to create a 
game that children would enjoy 
playing. The kids really like the 
appearance, he said. I think its 
very sleek. Animated in Adobe 
Flash, Carnegie Cadets had a 
style similar to that of a cartoon.
It was presented in a medium 
that the kids really, really loved, 
Strzempek said. The interface is
perfect for elementary school 
students, he explained, who are 
typically visual learners.
Its often difficult to attract 
children to educational software, 
Strzempek explained. Looking 
and feeling like a regular game 
has helped Carnegie Cadets to 
overcome that obstacle.
On top of that, the creators 
of Carnegie Cadets worked to 
captivate their players by pro
viding a wealth of empowering, 
adult activities, according to Da
vid Doyle, the teams multimedia 
software support.
More than anything else, chil
dren have relished the oppor
tunity to furnish a virtual dorm 
room. All they want to do is buy 
things for their room, Doyle 
said.
The team is working on a final 
version of the game to be released 
early this year. It will include ad
ditional minigames and a more 
comprehensive plot.

Author speaks about urban farms
FOREST, from A8
In addition, these forests are 
low maintenance and yield eight 
months worth of fresh fruits, 
vegetables and herbs.
Urban farming also enriches 
the soil through nitrogen fixa
tion. Nitrogen fixation is the 
process by which nitrogen gas, 
which cant be used directly by 
plants, is converted into useful 
nitrogen compounds like ammo
nia and nitrate, which are plant 
nutrients.
Jacke talked about the pro
duce of edible forest gardens. 
These gardens mimic a natural 
forest in which fruits, nuts, veg
etables, herbs, mushrooms, and 
other plants form symbiotic rela
tionships. On his website, Jacke 
stated that gardens produce 
high yields of food, fuel fiber, 
fodder, fertilizer, farmaceuticals, and fun.
Urban agriculture is an 
especially important resource 
for developing countries such as 
those in Africa and Latin Amer
ica. According to the Resource 
Centers on Urban Agriculture 
and Food Security (RUAF), researchers expect that 85 percent 
of the poor in Latin America will 
be located in urban communi
ties by the year 2020. In many 
instances, urban forests provide 
nutritional produce to individu
als who cannot afford to pur
chase their own food.
Urban forests also benefit the 
community as a whole. In partic
ular, households can grow their 
own produce and barter for in
come. Other enterprises brought 
about by urban farming include 
the packaging, marketing, and 
delivery of foods, thereby pro
viding jobs to urban residents.
Jacke said that forest designs 
depend on four key aspects: 
community architecture, social 
structure, structure of the un
derground economy, and succes
sion.
Community architecture is the 
design of a forest garden. In par
ticular, forest gardens typically 
consist of diverse vegetation lay
ers and various kinds of plants. 
Such variety leads to a diver
sity of bird and insect species, 
thereby offsetting the insect pest 
population.
The social structure consists
of plants and animals that pro
duce food and form symbiotic 
relationships. In particular, each 
organism in the social structure 
contributes to the gardens bio
logical processes. Jacke stated 
that to fully utilize the suns en
ergy, for instance, developers 
must grow plants with different 
light tolerances  plants that 
thrive in shady conditions as op
posed to plants that need a lot of 
sunlight.
The underground economy 
consists of the woody and herba
ceous plant roots. Understand
ing the pattern of root growth 
is critical to establishing a thriv
ing garden. If fruit trees can get 
a fraction of their roots deeper 
than the normal two or three 
feet of soil, they live longer, pro
duce more fruit, and are more 
resistant to disease.
According to Jacke, edible for
est gardens also serve a more hu
manistic purpose.
Forest gardening helps us 
take our rightful place as part 
of nature doing natures work, 
rather than as separate entities 
intervening in and dominating 
the natural world.

President Cohon spreading himself thin
Does appointment increase exposure for university or take time away from students?
Just before the turn of the new year, 
Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. 
Cohon was appointed chair of a new 
committee set to advise the Department 
of Homeland Security on travel policy 
for foreign visitors. Cohon has served 
on the Homeland Security Advisory 
Council in other capacities since 2002, 
when George W. Bush appointed him to 
the council.
This is just one of many affiliations Co
hon has outside of his role as president of 
Carnegie Mellon. According to the biog
raphy on his presidential website, Cohon 
serves on the board of directors of Mellon 
Financial Corporation; American Stan
dard, Inc.; the Health Effects Institute; 
the Heinz Center for Science, Econom
ics and the Environment; the Council on 
Competitiveness; the Carnegie Museums 
of Pittsburgh; the Pittsburgh Cultural 
Trust; the Urban League of Pittsburgh; 
and the Allegheny Conference on Com
munity Development.
With such a long list of corporations 
and organizations with which Cohon is
affiliated, it seems as though hes being 
pulled in too many directions. For many 
students, interactions with Cohon will 
only occur during first-year Orientation 
and four years later at Commencement. 
Cohon is not the sort of figure youre 
likely to bump into around campus these 
days, though this probably hasnt always 
been the case.
A photograph from the September 10, 
2001, issue of The Tartan shows a smil
ing Cohon on a grassy field as inflatable 
dinosaurs move in from all sides. The 
photo, taken at that falls Student Activi
ties Fair, shows a scene that seems much 
less likely to occur today.
Cohon is deliberate in keeping in 
touch with students through his Student 
Advisory Committee, the office hours he 
holds on a regular basis, and by invit
ing undergraduates to his own home for 
dinner in their senior year. While these 
steps may keep Cohon in the loop, stu
dents at large do not develop much of a 
connection with the president of their 
university.
This is not to criticize Cohons roles 
in assisting government agencies and 
serving on the boards of more than 
half a dozen organizations. Cohon is 
Carnegie Mellons ambassador to the 
world, and his involvement in other 
areas outside of academia serves our 
university well. In fact, its common 
for the presidents of elite schools to sit 
on the board of several organizations. 
MIT President Susan Hockfield sits on 
a dozen.
Cohons commitment to developing 
Carnegie Mellons stature as a top-tier 
university, expanding its global foot
print, and augmenting its endowment 
are unwavering, and his exposure to 
the leaders of government, industry, 
and philanthropic foundations is criti
cal to his success.
But Cohon will do well to heed the 
words of many an academic advisor: Be 
careful not to let your extracurricular 
activities come before your school 
work. We just want you home for din
ner, baby.
28 aXed?
Port Authority cuts would likely affect suburbanites more than college students
It may be time to become better 
friends with the elite car-owning stu
dents around campus. Pittsburgh Port 
Authority Transit recently announced 
major cuts to several bus routes through
out the city, two of which are significant 
to student life.
The big news for students is the im
pending loss of the 28X. If the 28X 
disappears, Carnegie Mellon students 
will join the ranks of college students 
throughout the nation who have to 
do more than walk to the edge of cam
pus and flash a school ID to get a ride 
to the airport. That is, unless a private 
company called Airlines Transporta
tion arranges a $5 shuttle service for 
students, a service they offered more 
frequently before the 28X came to life in 
1996, and something their parent com
pany, Pittsburgh Transportation Group, 
is suggesting might happen.
The proposed cuts  the elimination 
of 124 of 213 weekday bus routes  also 
include the 500 line, which takes pas
sengers from one side of the city to the 
other. For students, this would mean 
having to transfer lines to get to the War
hol Museum downtown.
The reality of the situation? It sucks 
but we dont have to deal with the brunt 
of the ordeal. Four hundred PAT employ
ees will be laid off, and suburbanites are 
looking at the complete extinction of 
their public transportation lines, which 
could affect passengers who rely on the 
bus to get to work every day. In fact, 
Oakland and downtown Pittsburgh are 
the least affected areas. The entirety of 
the proposed cuts results in a 25 percent 
reduction of the services provided by the 
nations 15th-largest public transporta
tion system, a system operating in the 
nations 28th-largest county.
Worst of all, these cutbacks look like 
the PATs only option of staying afloat. 
You may recall hearing about route 
changes in previous years; from 2000 
through 2004, four hearings were held 
that ultimately resulted in fare increases 
and service decreases. In 2005 and
2006, the PAT threatened more service 
cuts and higher costs, but Pennsylvania 
Governor Ed Rendells stopgap funding 
shifted federal highway funds to quickfix solutions for the public transportation 
systems. (This may explain a lot about 
the condition of the PA turnpike.)
The threats may seem like a farce  
' six continuous years of threats with few
major changes make the PAT sound a lot 
like the boy who cried wolf  but the 
Pennsylvania Transportation Funding 
and Reform Commission has declared 
a crisis situation, and Pittsburgh PAT 
CEO Steve Bland has said that these 
proposed changes are very real. With
out an effort by the PAT to create a more 
efficient and cost-effective system, the 
commission wont provide more funds. 
Currently, funds meant for the purchase 
of new buses are being used to balance 
the fiscal year 2007 budget instead.
Public hearings are being held 
starting today in an effort to further 
evaluate the proposed route changes. 
These are the most important and vi
able ways for your opinions to be heard. 
The PAT is looking for suggestions and 
ideas, and reasons why certain routes 
are necessary to you.
While we strongly recommend voic
ing your thoughts at the public hearings, 
we encourage you to think practically 
toward the future. Some cuts may be 
crucial now for the long-term survival 
of the PAT, and some slight incon
veniences for us may result in fewer 
inconveniences for Pittsburghers 
whose mobility is reliant on the buses.

Gift card epidemic wreaks 
havoc on Christmas spirit
Kelly Cahill
Instead of the usual tiny mountains 
of red and green bundles stacked un
der the Christmas tree this year, I found 
myself being handed a neat pile of what 
appeared to be small, gift-wrapped en
velopes. These holiday surprises bore 
the unmistakable shape of the gift giv
ers failLsafe: gift cards.
I can admit that gift cards are kind 
of fun. I enjoy the thrill of walking into 
a three-story H&M, gift card securely 
tucked into my wallet, and feeling like 
the armful of colorful Swedish cloth
ing I am about to purchase is essentially 
free. It puts me in a good enough mood 
to do awkward hip gyrations and head 
bobbing to Madonnas electronic excre
ment passing for music that H&M insists 
on blaring. I skip out of the store with a 
new sweater dress that is guaranteed to 
make me 10 times cuter without having 
done any damage to the balance of my 
already skimpy bank account. Bitchin!
Yeah, I like gift cards just as much 
as the next college student, budding 
preteen, coked-out step-cousin, middle-aged uncle, or wispy grandmother. 
Which is precisely the problem. Gift 
cards are incredibly generic. You can 
give them to any and everybody and rest 
peacefully knowing that the recipients 
will be happy shopping for themselves. 
But what makes Christmas, or Hanukkah, or your birthday special if you end 
up shopping for yourself? Sure, youre 
grateful and you get what you want in
stead of a boring day planner or a pair of 
alarmingly unattractive khakis, but its 
missing the sentiment of a more wellthought-out present.
The gift card epidemic has ravaged 
holidays and birthdays alike for several 
years now, but it has recently become 
easier than ever to put nearly non-existent effort into gift giving. Near the 
checkout at several of the larger chain 
grocery stores and convenience stores, 
you can actually purchase gift cards to 
other stores, like popular coffee shops, 
book stores, and electronics stores. You 
can swing by the supermarket to pick 
up milk, Kraft singles, spaghetti sauce, 
and, oh yeah, all of your holiday gifts.
The advent of the Visa gift card 
marked an all-time low in the amount 
of thought required for gift-giving. Ac
cepted anywhere Visa is accepted, the 
Visa gift card has virtually limitless 
possibilities when it comes to spend
ing. And now your friends and relatives 
dont even have to do any bothersome 
guesswork as to what stores you prefer! 
How delightfully convenient.
Gift cards deceive us into thinking 
that we are giving and receiving gifts, 
when what we are essentially doing 
is exchanging cash. Target had a tell
ing new marketing scheme for some 
of their gift cards this holiday season: 
They came up with a gift card that dou
bles as a small MP3 player. Who wants 
a goofy-MP3 player that looks like an 
Altoid tin and has Target logos all over 
it? No one. Its just another attempt to 
soothe any guilt we might feel about 
giving gift cards as presents. Why is it 
easier to give someone a $20 gift card 
to Target instead of just handing over 
a $20 bill? Because giving cash always 
seems slightly embarrassing and ap
pears thoughtless whereas gift cards 
appear less so, we feel much more com
fortable giving someone a gift card in 
place of the cash. Cut out the middle
man, eliminate the chance of Target 
making an easy 20 bucks when the gift 
card expires after a year or gets lost, and 
press a crisp Jackson into your nephews 
sweaty palm. If our gifts are doomed to 
be thoughtless, then we should at least 
be honest about it.
Gift cards are simply no replacement 
for a traditional present. Their tell-tale 
wrapped shapes always betray their 
contents and take the fun out of both 
giving and receiving. Yes, Christmas has 
been secularized and commercialized 
beyond all recognition, but that doesnt 
mean that we have to abandon the spirit 
of Christmas altogether. It's fun to shop 
for or make thoughtful gifts for others. 
And its so much more enjoyable and 
rewarding to watch your loved ones 
bright-eyed excitement when they open 
a gift that youve put real thought or 
time or effort into than to see the weak 
smile in reaction to yet another gift card.
I know Im a hopeless romantic when it 
comes to Christmas, but it seems like, if 
you take the time to celebrate it at all, 
then you should celebrate it right.

comments on gift cards, Swedes, and 
Madonna. She is Forum editor of The 
Tartan, and a sophomore majoring in

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 22, 2007
Proposed campus smoking ban put to referendum
Gerrit Betz
If you havent already heard, the admin
istration will be considering a proposal to 
ban all smoking on campus by 2010. That 
means you, the student body, should be 
considering it, too. Student Senate will 
hold a referendum on February 5 and 6 
to get your mandate, and your Senators 
will push hard for whatever you choose, 
pro or con.
Here are the highlights from the Healthy 
Campus 2010 Task Force proposal: No 
smoking anywhere on campus by 2010; 
no smoking in fraternities; fines and ci
tations for violations; Entropy would no 
longer sell cigarettes as of August 2007; 
no giving away free tobacco on campus. 
The proposal would also create more pro
grams to make students aware of the risk 
of smoking as well as programs to help 
them quit. Just to clarify, yes: Hookas, 
pipes, cigars, and chewing tobacco would 
all be prohibited.
So the question is whether to ban or 
not to ban. To discuss this, Ill repeat the 
strongest arguments Ive heard from stu
dents so far.
The arguments for a ban that I hear 
most from students are arguments for gen
eral campus health and individual rights. 
While there have not been any university 
surveys on students smoking habits, there 
seems to be plenty of anecdotal evidence 
that more students start smoking than 
quit smoking when they come to college. 
The hope is that if cigarettes arent for 
sale on campus, and if you cant smoke 
on campus, maybe people will finally 
quit smoking or simply never start. These 
results are also expected to compound. 
Most people start smoking because their 
friends do, so any increase or decrease in 
smokers is expected to have a ripple effect 
on social circles.
With regard to fraternities objections 
to the smoking ban, the bans supporters 
point out that not everyone who lives in 
and visits a fraternity can safely inhale 
smoke, like asthmatics and people with 
sensitive allergies. Health complaints 
from students with breathing problems 
are the reason that Housing no longer ofWe haveihe riaht" 4o ho\ 
ihhale cijarette smoke.
A|| smokinq should te banned
weYe ou{si4e.
A
fers smoking rooms in dormitories. Since 
Housing owns the on-campus fraternity 
houses, why should they be treated dif
ferently?
On the other hand, Ive heard many 
students argue vehemently against a ban. 
They argue that a full ban goes much too 
far because it steps on the toes of those 
who want to exercise a legal right to do 
what they please as long as it doesnt harm 
others. The Healthy Campus Task Forces 
position is that any smoking does harm 
others. The Task Forces proposal cites 
the surgeon generals report, The Health 
Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: 
There is no risk-free level of secondhand 
smoke exposure; even brief exposure can 
adversely affect the cardiovascular and 
respiratory system.
When I checked the surgeon generals 
report, the only definition for brief expo
sure that I could find was the following: 
The immediate effects in some measures
Elizabeth Liu/Art Staff
of blood and vascular functioning among 
nonsmokers from even brief exposures 
(i.e., 30 minutes or less) to secondhand 
smoke are comparable in magnitude to 
the effects observed in active smokers. 
The Six Major Conclusions of the 
Surgeon Generals Report contains five 
claims that there is no level of risk-free 
exposure to secondhand smoke, citing, 
Short exposures to secondhand smoke 
can cause blood platelets to become stick
ier, damage the lining of blood vessels, 
decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, 
and reduce heart rate variability, poten
tially increasing the risk of a heart attack. 
No definition of short is given, and the 
report admits that sidestream smoke is 
rapidly diluted as it travels away from the 
burning cigarette.
Walking through a crowd of even 
several smokers on your way into a 
building for 10 seconds is nowhere near 
the exposure this report describes. It
lasts nowhere near 30 minutes, and the 
smoke itself is likely to be very diluted by 
the time it reaches others, especially if 
smokers stand 20 feet from entrances of 
campus buildings.
Here you have a strong counterar
gument against a total outdoor ban. 
The basic principle of liberty is that my 
rights end where yours begin. I can do 
whatever I want as long as it doesnt in
fringe on your ability to do whatever you 
want. If there is no real harm to others in 
smoking outside, then it is not justifiable 
to ban it.
Here is the sticking point  ardent 
supporters of a ban would say that their 
right to not inhale cigarette smoke 
trumps the right to smoke wherever one 
pleases, even if outside. So the argument 
boils down to this: Is it better to uphold 
the rights of smokers to smoke, or nonsmokers to be free from smoke?
The whole debate also raises questions 
about what role the university should 
play in enforcing healthy behavior. If 
rules are passed under the justification 
that theyre good for us, then why not 
eliminate all unhealthy food from cam
pus? Isnt it my choice to be unhealthy?
In my opinion, the proposal is great un
til the point at which it attempts to ban 
smoking outdoors. Requiring smokers 
to stand 20 feet from building entrances 
with risk of fine is, well, fine. And add
ing more resources in the health center 
for students who choose to quit is a great 
idea regardless of the outcome of the 
proposal.
That said, I am also a Student Senator. 
So in two weeks, I will cast my vote as an 
individual, but if the totals come in and a 
majority has decided the opposite of my 
opinion, I will do what I can to make that 
opinion known to the powers that be.

United States double envelopment threatens liberty
Benjamin Hackett
Puring the summer of 216 
BCE, a major battle in the Sec
ond Punic War took place. Under 
consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro, 
the Romans gathered near 
Cannae intending to retaliate 
for previous defeats and crush 
the Carthaginians. A sizable 
force by any eras standards, the 
90,000-strong Roman force was 
composed mainly of Romes fin
est legions and allied troops. The 
objective was simple: Win the 
war by crushing the Carthagin
ian invasion of Italy.
Opposing the Romans were 
the Carthaginian forces, led 
by Hannibal. In the two years 
preceding the battle of Cannae, 
an intrepid Hannibal led two 
successful attacks on the Ro
mans at Trebbia and Trasimene. 
Dissatisfaction with current 
strategy and Roman defeats 
led to the ascension of Fabius 
Maximus as Roman dictator. 
Preferring indirect attacks on 
supply lines and strategic assets, 
Maximus led the engagement 
against the Carthaginians in the 
years following.
Eventually, a disheartened 
Roman public  one concerned
with swift victory  applied 
ample pressure causing the dis
placement of Fabius Maximus. In 
the next set of elections following 
the Roman Senates replacement 
of Maximus, Lucius Paullus and 
Gaius Varro were elected to di
rect the Roman effort against the 
Carthaginians.
In the battle of Cannae, a nu
merically superior Roman army 
proceeded to drive forward, 
amassing a huge force. The stra
tegic formation of the Roman 
army placed emphasis on a 
strong center through the collec
tion of a large majority of their 
heavy infantry in the forces core. 
The Roman cavalry, in many ac
counts comparably inferior to the 
Carthaginians, was placed out 
on the flanks. Thus, the Romans 
were betting on their heavy in
fantry center and strength in 
numbers to carry the day.
Hannibal, regarded by many 
as one of historys top military 
commanders, recognized the 
need for a strategic change to 
counter the numerically supe
rior and heavily weighted center 
of strength of the Roman forces. 
To counter the Roman strength, 
Hannibal rearranged his forces 
into a strategy now widely known 
as the double envelopment troop 
arrangement.
In the double envelopment, 
also known as the pincer move
ment, the military commander 
arranges his troops in a near arc 
formation, in many cases put
ting his more formidable forces 
on the outer flanks. Opposing 
forces are amassed in a single 
line, or a formation that is heavy 
in the center. When the battle 
ensues, the double envelopment 
engages the opposing army in its 
center while the flanks extend 
around it, eventually encircling 
it. When successfully under
taken as a military strategy, the 
double envelopment may lead to 
complete annihilation through 
the death or surrender of the en
emy forces.
Arguably, Hannibal was the 
earliest to employ this element 
of tactical warfare in a major 
conflict. At the battle of Cannae, 
Hannibal organized his stron
gest cavalry on the flanks and 
put a relatively weaker force at 
the center of his arc formation. 
As the Romans advanced on 
the center, they unwittingly al
lowed the Carthaginian forces 
to encircle them. As the Car
thaginian flanks encircled and 
advanced, the Roman army be
came completely surrounded 
with no area for retreat. Roman 
losses at the battle of Cannae are 
estimated between 60,000 and 
70,000, including many Roman 
senators as well as Roman consul 
Lucius Aemilius Paullus.
In the aftermath of the Roman 
defeat at Cannae, allegiance to 
the Roman republic wavered as 
their ability to lead and secure 
the republic was questioned. 
While eventually the Carthag
inians failed in their siege of 
the fortified city of Rome, these 
widespread losses in morale and 
military strength led to much up
heaval in the Roman republic.
Today the United States faces 
a double envelopment of its own. 
Many of the more progressive 
components of Western civiliza
tion are riding on decisive bat
tles between the West and the 
irreconcilable wing of radical 
Islam. The United States and its 
historical and strategic allies find 
themselves at the pivotal point of 
enemy encirclement.
Todays double envelopment 
includes, on the right flank, 
forces that desire the ascension 
of a worldwide theocracy and a 
deterioration of human rights 
and general welfare world
wide. The same anti-democratic 
enemies that oppress their 
own people seize assets under 
populist guises and use religious 
indoctrination to control their 
masses are aligning at a critical 
point in history.
Positioned on the adversarial 
left flank are internal enemies 
that oppose the republics oWn 
actions of self-preservation.
This internal subversion comes 
in many forms, including those 
who seek to undermine the mo
rale, effort, and public sentiment 
behind major struggles world
wide. It is internally through 
unbalanced media, political op
portunism overtaking public 
service, and individual agen
das overriding the public good 
that the West faces its toughest 
test. Unwittingly or otherwise, 
the contemporary elements op
posing thoughtful action of 
republican self-preservation are 
allying themselves with those 
seeking the destruction of prin
ciples of freedom and choice 
through an American defeat.
On the basis of politics and 
a misunderstood concept of 
American imperialism  which 
is nothing more than an expor
tation of democracy and eco
nomic liberalism  the amicable 
and progressive cause of liberty 
as a basic human right is now 
questioned. And just as Italian 
city-states defected from the Ro
man republic, so too do portions 
of the electorate defect from 
the American cause as morale 
is shaken and the cause under
mined from without and within.

Perspectives
MLK, Jr. offers 
inspiration for 
persistence
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Our guest columnist for this 
week is senior Rosalyce BroadousBrown, current president of 
SPIRIT. The following is an excerpt 
from her speech read last Monday 
in commemoration of the Martin 
Luther King, Jr. holiday. Her mes
sage reflects our philosophy and 
offers a standard against which 
we must all measure ourselves. As 
we look to the spring semester and 
to our futures, let us reflect on our 
many gifts and the ways in which 
we can make a difference by never 
giving up.
I feel confident in saying that, 
if given the opportunity, many of 
us would love to thank Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. for something. 
If Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. was around today, I would 
be content to thank him for one 
single act. I would thank him sim
ply because he kept going.
Many of us come to the conclu
sion that after weve done a great 
deed, weve earned the right to 
look the other way when there 
is another problem to be solved, 
making us complacent. While 
being a Carnegie Mellon student, 
Ive learned many lessons. As my 
senior year comes to a close, the 
lesson that sticks out in my mind 
is that great things dont hap
pen because you start something. 
They happen because you pur
pose not to stop.
I believe that understanding a 
problem and not actively seeking 
opportunities to become a part of 
the solution is also complacency. 
If Martin Luther King had operat
ed in that manner, he could easily 
still be waiting for civil rights to 
be handed out to everyone, and 
we might still be suffering the 
consequences.
Oftentimes Martin Luther King 
is praised as if he did a single 
great thing, and it changed all of 
our lives. In reality it was every 
meeting with government offi
cials, every church gathering, 
every protest, and every speech 
that made him great.
We each miss out on oppor
tunities when we choose to be 
complacent. We miss out on 
opportunities to help others, and 
we miss out on opportunities to 
help ourselves. I believe it isnt 
wise to miss out on a chance to 
help someone, because you may 
be his or her only opportunity. 
You may be their only chance at a 
meal, their only chance at learn
ing to read, or their only chance 
at knowing that their future can 
be better than their past.
Martin Luther King worked 
and fought so hard because he 
believed, with all of his heart, in 
the idea of a better future. The 
more we begin to believe in the 
idea that there is a better future 
for anyone who seeks it, the more 
Dr.. Kings dream will become a 
tangible reality that continues to 
positively impact lives for genera
tions to come.
We miss the holiday season already. So we asked,
What is the worst gift you gave this year?A PERSONS OPINION

to close the Chicago lead to 13, 
but the Maroons scored the next 
26 points and 41 of the next 45  
including 10 straight by Maroon 
guard Lori Tanaka, punctuated by 
only a Carnegie Mellon free throw
 to take an insurmountable 50- 
point lead with six minutes to 
play, leading to an eventual win: 
Maroons 91, Tartans 49.
[We] knew we could play with 
them, Mazziotta said. With a 
young team, weve now played 
the top two or three teams in the 
UAA close.
SeidL is hopeful about what 
such close play against strong 
conference rivals means for the 
rest of this season. We need to 
play this way when we play those 
teams [the remaining conference 
schedule], she said.
Earlier in the week, in their fi
nal non-conference game of the 
season, the Tartans built an early 
lead of eight points in the first 
eight minutes over the Bethany 
(W.Va.) College Bison (6-10). The
Bison closed the gap, however, 
building their own seven-point 
lead with under two minutes to 
play in the first half, but an eightpoint run took Carnegie Mellon 
into intermission with a single
point advantage.
In the second half, the Bison 
re-established themselves with a 
22-9 run that put their lead at 54- 
42 with under seven minutes to 
play, but the Tartans fought back 
again, once again overtaking their 
opponents on first-year guard 
Paige Williamsons eight points 
in a short 50-second stretch. After 
trading a Bison layup for a Tartan 
free throw, Carnegie Mellons sec
ond foul shot missed with seven 
seconds left and Bethany guard 
Lisa Mitchell took a pass and 
beat the buzzer from three-point 
range to take the improbable win, 
67-66.

The Ohio State offense never 
got on track. Smith, this years 
Heisman winner, only com
pleted four passes for 35 yards. 
He was sacked five times, he 
fumbled once, and he threw an 
interception.
The lack of recognition for 
the efforts of these ginormous 
creatures (NFL linemen weigh 
an average of 312 pounds) is an 
injustice.
The only offensive lineman 
to make a run at the Heisman 
Trophy (awarded to college 
footballs best player) in re
cent history was Ohio States 
Orlando Pace, when he placed 
fourth in 1996.
Next, youd have to go back to 
1973 when another Ohio State 
left tackle, John Hicks, fin
ished runnr-up. An offensive 
lineman wont be considered a 
legitimate candidate in the near 
future either, as linemen dont 
have statistics. Not many voters 
are going to overlook a quarter
back who threw for 3000 yards 
or a running back who rushed 
for 1500 yards and pick a line
man.
Despite not having compa
rable statistics, good offensive 
linemen arent a dime a dozen. 
Linemen are highly valued in 
the NFL  just take one look 
at their salaries. An article in
the September 25, 2006 Sports 
Illustrated looked at the lucra
tive evolution of the left tackle. 
The left tackle is unique as this 
player sets up on the far left side 
of the offensive line and must 
protect his quarterbacks blind 
side. Most quarterbacks are 
right-handed, so they will have 
their back to the left side of 
the field. As the article stated, 
before the 2000 season the Bal
timore Ravens re-signed left 
tackle Jonathan Ogden for six 
years and $44 million.
This meant he would be mak
ing eight times more than the 
man he was protecting, quar
terback Trent Dilfer. Oh, and 
another thing: Did you know 
that before each snap the cen
ter has the responsibility of 
determining the likely action of 
the defense, and then adjusting 
the blocking assignments of his 
teammates accordingly through 
audible and visual signals? Its 
not as simple as just hitting the 
closest guy to you.
Im not saying that offensive 
linemen should be idolized 
or made more famous than 
quarterbacks. I am saying they 
deserve more recognition and 
respect. Next time a quarter
back has all day to throw or a 
running back sprints through 
a huge hole, stop and applaud 
the work of the offensive line. 
Thats all they wanta little 
respect.

The most underrated 
position in sports is that of an 
offensive lineman in football. 
Five offensive linemen make 
up an offensive line. These five 
players  two tackles, two 
guards, and a center  are put 
in a precarious position. When 
they succeed, someone else gets 
the credit, and when they fail, 
they take the blame.
An offensive linemans job 
is to block. They block on all 
running and passing plays, and 
theyre not allowed to catch or 
run the ball  except in rare 
circumstances.
Name an offensive lineman 
in the NFL. Most people cant, 
but they can name the best run
ning backs and quarterbacks, 
most of whom will attribute 
their success in part to the work 
of those hogmollies up front.
A perfect example of how 
the play of the offensive line 
can affect a game occurred 
in the College Football Na
tional Championship earlier 
this month between the Flor
ida Gators and the Ohio State 
Buckeyes. Florida came into the 
game as the underdog, but eas
ily won 41-14, thanks, in large 
part, to their defenses ability 
to pressure Ohio State quarter
back Troy Smith.

Mens basketball teams 
winning streak endsCarnegie Mellon
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team had a successful 
winter break, winning four of five 
games, including home confer
ence wins against 20th-ranked 
New York University and 23rdranked Brandeis University. The 
Tartans entered this past week 
with a 9-3 overall record and a 
2-1 record in the University Ath
letic Association (UAA).
The Tartans played a trio of road 
games this past week and wound 
up losing all three. On Monday, 
the Tartans sawtheir four-game 
winning streak snapped as they 
fell 66-65 to Lycoming College 
in Williamsport, Pa.
The game was as close as the 
final score indicated  there 
were 12 ties and 14 lead changes 
throughout the game. The Tar
tans forced a turnover and called 
a timeout, trailing by one with 
5.6 seconds remaining. Their po
tential game-winning shot never 
materialized as the Warriors de
fense swarmed the ball and.didnt 
allow a shot. Sophomore Ryan 
Einwag led the Tartans with 21 
points onnine-of-11 shooting, and 
sophomore Jon Wolleben added 
11 points and eight rebounds in 
the loss.
Carnegie Mellon continued its 
road trip, taking on the Univer
sity of Chicago on Friday night 
and Washington University (Mo.) 
on Sunday afternoon. Against 
Chicago the Tartans lost 100-69, 
thanks to Chicago making 60.7 
percent of their shots and out-re
bounding Carnegie Mellon 44-27. 
The Maroons also made 12 threepointers whereas the Tartans only 
knocked down two. Einwag was 
the only Tartan to score in double 
figures as he led the Tartans with 
20 points on seven-of-13 shooting. 
The Tartans were able to force 19 
turnovers in the loss, but unfortu
nately it wasnt enough.
After playing a talented Chi
cago team (12-3 overall) the 
Tartans visited St. Louis to take on 
the 13th-ranked Wash. U. Bears. 
The Bears defeated the Tartans 
73-49, leaving the Tartans at 9-6 
overall and 2-3 in the UAA. The 
Bears recorded their lith straight 
win to improve to 14-1 and 5-0 in 
the UAA.
Not much went right for the 
Tartans against Wash. U., as the 
Tartans were plagued by poor 
shooting (27.6 percent for the 
game) and turnovers (23). The 
Tartans fell behind 30-16 at halftime and were unable to cut the 
deficit in the final half. Junior 
guard Geoff Kozak was the only 
Tartan in double figures, leading 
the way with 11 points.
We did not come ready to play 
against Chicago on Friday, and it 
showed, said senior guard and 
co-captain Brad Matta. In the 
UAA, if youre not ready to play 
40 minutes, youre in for an uphill 
battle. These games demonstrated 
to us how hard it is to win on the 
road in a conference like the UAA. 
We play our next couple games at 
home and well try to get back 
on track. Once we start having 
more fun, moving quicker, makSee MENS, page A15

Our biggest thing was playing 
two halves. We played one against 
Chicago and we played two good 
halves again today, Carnegie 
Mellon womens basketball coach 
Gerri Seidl summed up.
While their road games against 
two strong conference opponents, 
the University of Chicago and 
Washington University (Mo.), put 
them at the short end of the score
board, the young team showed 
the improvement they hope will 
carry through the rest of the sea
son.
Sundays game against Wash. 
U. (12-4, 4-1 UAA) found the 
Tartans (6-10, 0-5 UAA) against 
a tough Bears team that had won 
10 of its previous 11 games. Carn
egie Mellon held close behind the 
Bears in the first half, twice pull
ing within two points  first on 
junior guard Leah Feolas threepointer and again a minute later 
on a jump shot by sophomore for
ward Ashley Rothwell. Feola and 
sophomore guard Stacie Aleski 
both put up eight points in the 
half. Picking up on defense as the 
first half ended, a quick 6-0 run 
at the end of the half closed Wash. 
U.s lead to only 34-30 before the 
Bears last-second shot drained 
for two.
Coming out for the second 
period, the Tartans defense 
solidified and held Wash. U.s lead 
steady around six for the first five 
minutes of play before a Wash. U. 
layup pulled them out to eight. 
With Carnegie Mellon unable to
convert a quick pair of steals into 
points, Wash. U. increased their 
lead to 17 on strong play in the 
paint by their center, senior Re
becca Parker.
The Tartans netted two threes 
late in the half one from Aleski 
and one from senior guard Ashley 
Mazziottaand closed the Wash. 
U. gap back to 13, but Wash. U. 
closed out the game and took the 
victory, 76-64.
Carnegie Mellon was led by a 
double-double from Feola, who 
finished with 16 points and 12 
boards in the game on her 50 
percent shooting from the floor, 
earning praise from Seidl for her 
fantastic game. Seidl was also 
pleased by Mazziottas leadership. 
She took control on the floor... 
making sure we were where we 
were supposed to be, Seidl said.
In the teams weekend opener 
Friday against UAA powerhouse 
llth-ranked Chicago (16-0, 5-0 
UAA), the Tartans fell behind 
early, but kept pace before a 15-0 
Maroon run  largely on a strong 
shooting performance from the 
foul stripe  put Carnegie Mel
lon in the hole 32-12. Though 
the Tartans closed part of the gap 
on guard Aleskis three straight 
three-pointers late in the half, 
Chicago owned a 15-point lead at 
halftime.
The [sophomores] are starting 
to come out and hit shots, noted 
Mazziotta about her younger 
teammates, and thats big for 
this team.
Out of the break, Tartan for
ward Rothwell hit a quick jumper

Each week during the football 
season, and now the basketball 
season, the Carnegie Mellon 
varsity cheerleading squad has 
been present and showing their 
support and pride for our ath
letic teams.
They work year round and are 
the voice of Carnegie Mellon at 
fall and winter sporting events.
To show our appreciation, 
the Tartan sat down with senior 
co-captains Brandi Tish and 
Emma Friedman to hear what 
collegiate cheerleading is really 
about.
Tartan: So tell us a little 
about the team itself.
Tish: Well theres about 15 of 
us; we have a couple of seniors, 
and we actually have two gradu
ate students on the squad.
Frieman: We also have a new
J
coach, Alauna Dunphy, from the 
University of Minnesota, and 
shes really amazing.
Tartan: Do you and the other 
girls have any other type of ath
letic background?
T: I cheered in elementary 
and middle school, but in high 
school I got into gymnastics, 
skiing, and fencing. Then when
I came to Carnegie Mellon there 
was no gymnastics team, and 
skiing really isnt big around 
here, so I got back into cheer
leading.
F: I was actually a very seri
ous gymnast all through high 
school. We were really good, 
but then I threw my back out 
and couldnt ever really get back 
into gymnastics. I didnt start 
cheerleading until my sopho
more year at Carnegie Mellon, 
but I really enjoy it.
T: And then most of the other 
girls did different sports as well. 
There ap actually very few girls
on the squad that came to Carn
egie Mellon as cheerleaders .or 
had a lot of cheerleading expe
rience.
F: Yeah, we have pretty much 
someone whos participated in 
every sport: track, basketball, 
a lot of gymnastics, and a lot of 
dancing. Every year we have to 
fight Dancers Symposium for 
some girls.
Tartan: Can you try and give 
us an idea of what a typical 
cheerleading practice is like for 
you?
Both: INTENSE!
F: In the fall, we mostly prac
tice different cheers for during 
the football games, but we have 
a new halftime dance routine 
for during basketball games 
that our coach choreographed 
for us, and its really awesome, 
but hard.
T: We have three straight min
utes of non-stop aerobic activity, 
and its really fast pa^ed, so we
start with cardio and then do a 
lot of stretching.
We do a lot of work on jumps 
and stunts, and then we start 
piecing together parts of our 
routine and trying to get the 
whole thing together.
F: Its a very athletic, fun rou
tine. It will be really great once 
we have everything worked out, 
so lately thats what pretty much 
we have spent our practices 
working on.
Tartan: Wow, this sounds 
like it should be a great halftime show to see. Any idea when 
youll start performing it at 
games?
F: Were aiming for the game 
on Friday against Emory. Thats 
our goal. We still have a lot of 
work to do though, so it will be 
really great if were ready by 
then.
T: Itll be a lot of fun, Im re
ally excited to get out there and 
try it!

Sundance: only a click wheel away
Filmmaking goes portable in the second iPod Film Festival
It's year two for the iPod Film Festival, hosted by 
the online short film advocates at The Flux {www. 
theflux.tv). A recent manifestation of the current 
generation's appetite for high technology, iPods 
are now being used to promote new bands and 
independent filmmakers. With incentives in the 
form of prizes  an iPod or an Apple Mac Mini
 participants need only submit an indie film, 
student film, or creative thought on tape that is less 
than ten minutes long. Oh, and the video must be 
iPod compatible.
Independent films have been gaining more 
attention; Little Miss Sunshine, for example, was 
nominated for two Golden Globes, 
and with the attention Apple 
has acquired due to their 
ever-growing collection 
of gadgetry, the 
connection between 
the two seems a 
wise choice, 
right?
Maybe.
There 
is some 
value at 
least, namely 
the prospect 
of making a 
film by oneself.
"[There are] a lot of 
films being produced 
quickly and cheaply 
by people who wouldnt 
have had the resources a 
decade ago to rent or buy a 
real film camera and manually 
cut their film in a studio," said 
David Hartunian, a movie and 
iPod enthusiast, WRCT staff 
member, and junior mathematics 
major.
According to Hartunian, the 
festival "is both a good and a bad 
thing. Its a lot like how theres a 
ton of random bands on MySpace. 
com that are quite terrible but 
somehow feel like they deserve to be heard.
Drew Hendrickson I Photo Staff
But dont worry, the headaches will not be yours 
to bear: The task of trudging through the chaos of 
amateur films will be left to a panel of judges, whose 
votes will be combined with those of visitors to The 
Flux.
The use of iPods in a film festival is, admittedly, 
a bit inventive. iPod users have the world at their 
fingertips  one touch on the swirly pad yields easy 
access to music, movies, and photographs. This 
control is precisely the point, says Hartunian. And 
although he agrees that the iPod revolution is good, 
perhaps the iPod Film Festival is not.
"[Short] films are a great format for expressing 
certain ideas ... but I dont agree with using the 
popularity of iPods to create some sort of artificial 
buzz for an art form that has nothing really to do 
with the device, he said. "The iPod didnt inspire 
any kids to pick up a guitar and play, music did.
I am interested in short film festivals that use 
iPod-compatible videos to promote screenings and 
spread information, but not ones that use iPods as 
an exclusive medium."
Still, The Flux has a 
noble cause. In an 
announcement 
on Mac Slash 
(.macslash. 
org),
producer 
Ryan Ritchey 
wrote, "[The] 
iPod video has 
people yearning 
for fun, portable video 
content, and our festival 
will give people access to 
free content, while exposing 
independent filmmakers 
and bands to an exciting 
new audience." So far, thats 
right. Last year's entries 
came from eleven 
countries across the 
globe. And though 
in 2006 The Flux 
charged $15 in 
fees to submit 
a video, the 
company 
has 
since 
thought 
better of 
such charges.
The newly instated 
free entry policy does 
make this festival a bit 
tempting. That, and the 
chance to win (another) iPod or 
even a Mac is a strong incentive. If 
you're satisfied with your current iPod situation and 
the Macs in the cluster, I wouldnt bother. But if you 
dare to dream of fleeting fame and potential prizes, 
the deadline to submit is March 18th.

Everything you need to know
About marrying early and dating your opposite 
Dear Janet, Dear Janet,
I have a really good friend from 
high school who just got engaged 
this summer. Normally that would 
not be a problem, but we are 
only eighteen! It seems to me 
she just likes the idea of getting 
married, and I am worried that if 
she marries this guy it wont last. 
What can I say to her to convince 
her to wait a while?
-So Concerned 
Eager Darling
Dear SCARED,
About Really
Whats most important is that you 
communicate your concerns in 
the most non-confrontational way 
possible. Ask her if shes sure she 
wants to get married this young, 
and tell her that youre concerned 
that she might not be marrying 
for the right reasons. Make sure 
that you treat it as a conversation 
rather than a rant. Make it clear 
that youre concerned about the 
concept of her getting married, 
not that you hate her fianc.
A thought: Maybe your friend really 
does just want to get married. We 
all know someone who went to 
college to get her M.R.S., and 
if your friend does seem really 
excited about her choice, youll 
have to accept it.
-Janet
My girlfriend and I really hit it 
off, great chemistry physically 
and emotionally. Im just worried 
that taste-wise we might be too 
different. Shes kind of a jock 
and I don't take sports seriously. 
Shes conservative, Im liberal. 
She listens to the Dixie Chicks, I 
listen to Fugazi. I mean, right now 
we kid each other about these 
differences, but do you think this 
might end up being a problem 
later on down the line?
-Attracted To an Offbeat, Diverse, 
and Different Soul
Dear AT ODDS,
Things like liking the same music 
and playing the same sports 
are the most important at the 
beginning of a relationship. Once 
youre established, the emotional 
compatibility becomes far more 
important, and you grow to find 
things you agree on. But as long 
as you enjoy your time together 
and feel secure in the relationship 
beyond this issue, theres no 
reason that a punk and a jock 
chick cant hold hands, run into 
the sunset, and be happy together 
forever. Just dont expect her to 
follow you into the mosh pit.
-Janet

A must-see three at the Carnegie Museum of Art
Exhibits feature Rembrandt, Borofsky, and London architecture
Few people manage to progress from art-centric-buzzword 
status to household name. Those that do become household 
names usually have to spend a few years six feet under the 
ground before they attract the big crowds and rake in the 
big dollars  Picasso will bring in a much larger crowd than 
Jonathan Borofsky, and Frank Lloyd Wright will bring in a 
much larger crowd than, say, six London architecture firms

have created a niche for themselves, people tend to forget 
their other talents  most know of Rembrandt as a painter, 
but few know of him as a prolific etcher.
The Carnegie Museum of Art (CMA) is tackling three lesserknowns in three must-see exhibits that offer dramatically 
different experiences and shed new light on the artist or art in 
question.
Rembrandts Great Subjects: Prints from the 
Collection Through February 11
Rembrandt is easy to visualize: a somewhat portly man with a 
bulbous nose, his dark velvety Renaissance clothing blending 
into the background of his equally easy-to-visualize selfportrait. In celebration of his 400th birthday, the Dutch painter 
(as he is most often classified) is being remembered by the 
CMA not through his rich brown-hued paintings, but rather 
through 60 of his etchings.
Etching is a laborious effort. It involves using needles to carve 
into a copper sheet, washing the sheet in acid to control the 
depth of the carvings, covering the sheet in ink, and pressing 
a dampened paper onto the ink-covered copper plate. 
Rembrandt mastered the process.
The pieces are separated into categories common to most of 
Rembrandts work, including self-portraits, portraits, religious 
scenes, myths, and landscapes. Separating the work into 
categories makes Rembrandt's stylistic changes and growth 
as an artist more evident. The most easily discernible changes 
are in his portraiture styles, which became darker and more 
precise over time.
While the entirety of the collection is remarkable, the 
precision and detail in each etching is the most striking 
element of the exhibit and the most revealing of Rembrandt 
as an artist. In The Three Trees (1643), which is perhaps 
Rembrandts most famous landscape etching, there is a 
draughtsman hardly more than an eighth of an inch tall 
sitting on a hill. It's an element easy to skip over if not for the 
description beside the piece, and once you catch that, you 
catch the miniscule skyline of Amsterdam in the background, 
the lovers in the brush by the water, and the workers in a field.
The fact that the exhibit provides magnifying glasses for 
viewing the art speaks volumes about the intricacies of the 
etchings, and the little surprises hidden in each work reveal a 
Rembrandt more clever than his popular and generally gloomy 
paintings let on.
Jonathan Borofsky: Human Structures Through 
March 11
Modern art has seen few artists as inspired by the archetypal 
human form as Carnegie Mellon CFA alum Jonathan Borofsky. 
Borofsky, a'name infamous on campus because of "Walking 
to the Sky," uses the human forms and the concept of selfportraiture to both question and make statements about the 
struggle between internal and external forces.
Borofsky's piece currently at the CMA, Human Structures, 
is a towering and weaving series of convex and concave 
human forms interlocking at the hands. The semi-transparent 
forms are a variety of bright colors, and their alternating forms 
make for a piece that is fun and interesting to view from 
any angle. Incidentally, every angle provides a completely 
new experience for the viewer. Look through the pieces to 
experience an oblong heart-shaped tunnel of colors. Focus 
on one cylindrical section to see a piece that condenses and 
opens over and over again up to the top of the structure. See 
past one cylindrical section to see two others overlapping and 
weaving in and out.
Ultimately, Borofsky's Human Structures" is a fun piece to 
experience, and may be even a great way to re-evaluate what 
you think about "Walking to the Sky.
Gritty Brits: New London Architecture Through June 3
Ask anyone to name an architect, and odds are that the 
response will be Frank Lloyd Wright." If not Wright, maybe 
a slightly more architecturally educated person will offer I.
M. Pei, Frank Gehry, or Louis Khan. Architects have created 
every single building you enter, and yet few architects names 
are common knowledge. An even less recognized aspect of 
architecture is the scope of skill architects regularly engage to 
create their final pieces.
Gritty Brits, if nothing else, is a spectacular showing of the 
skill architects possess beyond straightforward building 
design. Six architecture firms in London show off their 
conceptualizations, sketching, model-building prowess,
3-D rendering skills, and finessed photography. Some of the 
most impressive elements of their work are shown in the 
modeling. Some models are comprised of intricate woodwork 
and matte board. Some capture just the building, while others 
incorporate the surrounding landscape as well.
In Gritty Brits, Adjaye/Associates, Caruso St John Architects, 
FAT, Niall McLaughlin Architects, muf, and Sergison 
Bates architects each present their latest building designs 
for a London that embraces the characteristics of British 
Modernism, post-industrialization, and growing immigration 
in a way that brings in the new without ignoring the old.
The works include urban housing, churches, and getaways, 
among other projects.
Overall focus on light, accommodation of a variety of people, 
and the melding of opposing materials like light wood and 
poured concrete reveal a new wave of accessible architecture.

Heinz Halls hot Botti
Trumpeter puts on a good show, even if it took 30 years
Air molecules vibrated and grooved to the melodies 
and improvisation last Thursday night as Grammynominated artist Chris Botti, jazz trumpeter, played 
Heinz Hall for the first time.
With the stage backlit in a mood-setting purple and 
the sold-out house filled with jazz lovers, old and young 
alike, Botti kicked off the concert with a soulful trumpet 
piece accompanied solely by Andy Ezrin on a grand 
piano. The following two hours proceeded with Botti 
playing numerous original scores, along with covers 
of classics by Miles Davis and Stevie Wonder, with 
improvisation and not just trumpet, but also guitar, 
drum, and piano solos.
Botti's trumpet had a tone of sweetness that even on 
the more lively improvisations reflected his own styling 
and persona. Resonating powerfully throughout Heinz 
Hall, Bottis playing was infused with immense' energy, 
but he still seemed to be holding back in case his 
band members challenged him with their own creative 
interpretations. This control looked easy for Botti, 
showing him as an accomplished and mature musician. 
There were times, however, when other sections of the 
band made Bottis trumpet shrink back.
At times, guitarist Mark Whitfield and drummer Billy 
Kilson nearly stole the show as Botti stood to the side 
with his trumpet ready. Whitfields guitar solos lit up the 
eardrums with an unidentified number between Willow 
Weep for Me" and Stevie Wonders Isnt She Lovely. 
Kilson was even more impressive on two drum solos:
In one, he lost a drum stick (although it was probably 
staged). Bassist James Genus laid down funk-inspired 
support that kept the rhythm of songs bordering on 
rambunctious.
Sy Smith, Whitfields cousin, offered her sweet soulful 
vocals in The Look of Love," although the performance 
lacked the energy of the music of the other songs. Ever 
cognizant of their roots, Botti, Ezrin, and Whitfield 
honored recently deceased jazz saxophonist Michael 
Brecker with "Hallelujah."
Bottis jazz debut was the album Ftist Wish in 1995.
Most of his early work can be characterized as smooth 
jazz, and it came after years of playing in the bands of
great performers such as Frank Sinatra. Bottis recent 
work has been influenced more by traditional jazz styles 
along with fusion and funk. To Love Again: The Duets 
from 2005 featured pop vocalists interlaced with popjazz and orchestral jazz tunes.
At the concert, supported by the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra and WQED Multimedia, Botti showed himself 
to be a lively and entertaining speaker, reminiscing 
about his journey to jazz and the trumpet as he grew 
up in Portland, Oregon. Bottis voice conveyed his own 
humility when he joked that musicians "need a lot 
of encouragement because they suck for the first 30 
years. Botti is 45.
Recalling how he had put the band together, he said,
I did what any good bandleader would do  I went 
to Google." Plugging PBS for its promotion of jazz 
and music education, Botti interspersed music with 
anecdotes of his tour as the opening act for Sting and 
his run-ins with Sinatra. In introducing fellow band 
members, Botti also weaved a colorful account of their 
talent through third-person narrative. With a natural 
flair for showmanship, Botti serenaded a woman in the 
audience with My Funny Valentine" for his penultimate 
act.
The blend of styles and range of ability of Botti and his 
band made the show thoroughly enjoyable to jazz lovers 
and newcomers alike. Kilsons stellar solos gave the 
concert an added je ne sais quoi quality  appreciable 
even to those who claim that jazz puts them to sleep.

Electronic and pop favorites from 2006
Junior Boys - So This is Goodbye. Gentle electro-pop on this 
sophomore album from the group that makes the Postal Service 
sound decidedly out of date. Steady beats, some dub influences, and 
soothing male vocals make this one great for quiet afternoons.
The Knife  Silent Shout. To be honest, I was more into Deep Cuts, 
their previous album, but Silent Shout is slowly growing on me as a 
fantastic example of out-of-this-world vocals coupled with in-yourface synth attacks. Its simultaneously beautiful and harsh.
Matmos  The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast. Sixth album 
from the sampie-based duo. Matmos is one of the few acts right now 
that can be said to use sound as an instrument; anything that can 
be recorded goes. The 10 tracks each stand for a person the band 
admires.
Asobi Seksu  Citrus. Shoegaze-influenced pop fronted by a 
Japanese singer, echoing Galaxie 500 and My Bloody Valentine, but 
at once more sugary in its structure and melodies while still adding a 
hefty dose of noise explosions every once in a while.
Ellen Allien and Apparat  Orchestra of Bubbles. A truly solid release 
from two modern techno giants. The album fuses modern German 
techno trends with pop and IDM influences to create something 
instantly accessible and exciting. A great gateway to everything 
exciting about European techno right now.
Lindstram  It's a Feedelity Affair. This great collection of 12-inch 
recordings released in the last few years combines disco and minimal 
influences to create infectious dance tunes.
Rex the Dog - Maximize. Not an album but a 12-inch on Germanys 
Kompakt label, it was good enough to mention if only for its seriously 
intense synth/beat combo that will knock you down but then pick you 
back up and convince you that dancing could actually save lives.
Jonas Bering  Behind this Silence. A great 12-inch also on Kompakt, 
this is a wonderful example of how exciting minimal and ambient house 
can be. Best enjoyed with a clear head early in the morning.
Hot Chip - The Warning. This groups lies somewhere between Junior 
Boys and the Knife in terms of sound and far from both in attitude. The 
band members probably take themselves the least seriously out of 
anyone reviewed today and invite listeners to kick back and enjoy their 
funky dance tracks long into the night.

A new year, a new bodyFitness Factoids
Top ten ways to stick to your New Years resolution
1 Exercising is not only clinically proven to benefit your 
body, but also to improve your mental functioning.
2 Doctors believe that exercising actually helps 
relieve stress.
3 Exercising gives you an energy boost, and can help 
with everyday activities like climbing stairs and 
walking to work.
4 Research shows that exercise can help fight off 
diseases and medical problems like high blood 
pressure, diabetes, and heart disease.
5 Wish you could eat more fattening foods? Well, 
more muscles actually increase the speed of your 
metabolism, which means: more cookies and 
potato chips!
6 Even one hour of exercise a day is enough to lose 
weight and keep it off, doctors say.
7 Fitness is also a great social booster, so exercise 
with friends or partners.
8 In addition to preventing heart disease, exercising 
helps make your heart stronger. This makes other 
physical parts of daily life feel less strenuous.
9 Exercising builds muscle tone and improves muscle 
efficiency and endurance.
10 Exercising can help you feel good about yourself 
and about life  you need those endorphins.

Losing weight often ranks high on people's lists of New 
Years resolutions. Unfortunately, many people dont even 
keep that resolution one month.
As the American population becomes more and" more 
overweight, sticking to this New Year's resolution is 
more crucial than ever. Even if you are not overweight, 
maintaining a healthy body is just as important. Yet 
exercise often gets pushed to the wayside by classes, work, 
and extracurricular activities. Students often overlook and 
dismiss exercise as a priority. But you do not have to put m 
hours every day at a gym to see results and feel physically 
better. Consider the following fitness ideas to help you stick 
to your New Years resolution of creating a healthier you.
We pay for a membership to fitness facilities, whether we 
use them or not. Skibo and the University Center gyms 
are great places to begin your new fitness programs. They 
offer a variety of fitness options, even for those who dread 
the thought of using dumbbells or walking on a treadmill: 
Skibo has courts for badminton, basketball, and volleyball, 
while the UC allows students access to its eight-lane pool, 
racquetball and squash courts, and gyms for basketball and 
volleyball.
The UC sponsors a number of intramural and club sports, 
as well as group exercise classes that often include body 
sculpting, indoor cycling, Pilates, step, Tai-Chi, and yoga.
For those who would rather exercise outdoors, Gesling 
Stadium is always an option. The Astroturf field is lined 
for both football and soccer games, and the eight-lane 
all-weather track is great for a late night study break walk 
or run since the field is always lighted. In addition to the 
stadium, the six tennis courts across from the UC are also 
lighted and allow for nighttime exercise. If you are a student 
who lives off campus, there are easy fitness opportunities 
for you as well. Many Pittsburgh streets are lined with 
sidewalks that make walking or jogging a convenient fitness
certified personal trainer
option. Schenley and Frick parks have multiple trails for 
running, walking, or biking in addition to large open spaces 
for games of Frisbee or football.
Fitness options are numerous on campus, and there is 
something for almost everyone. It is important to remember 
that exercising does not have to be an hour-long sweat 
session on a treadmill in the gym; any activity that gets 
your heart pumping is considered a workout.
One thing to keep in mind when beginning to exercise is 
to take it easy at first and not to overdo it. Overexerting 
yourself when beginning a new program can do more harm 
than good to the body. Injury from overuse or pure physical 
burnout may occur, both of which may deter a person from 
meeting certain fitness goals.
Students should know what they are getting into by 
creating an exercise regimen before they decide to dive in 
headfirst. Students with pre-existing health conditions like 
heart disease, muscular dysfunctions, and diabetes should 
consult their physician before beginning a serious exercise 
program. Consulting a personal trainer or an exercise 
specialist may also be helpful when learning how to operate 
different weight machines or finding a target heart rate.

Eternal damnation = uncomfortable furniture
With No Exit, Garfield Artworks hosts Sartres vision of Hell
"Hell is other people"  inarguably that is the most famous 
line from Jean-Paul Sartre's play No Exit. At Garfield Artworks, 
Hell was two ugly couches and track lighting. That, a 
comfortable chair, and a bronze sculpture on a table were all 
that sat on the stage, which was at eye level. The audience, 
made up of men and women mostly in their 20s, sat on 
folding chairs in a room three times deeper than it was wide. 
Last Saturday night was the final performance of Cup-A-Jo 
Productions No Exit, which ran for two weekends in a row.
From the sidewalk, Garfield Artworks is just another 
storefront, but upon entering, a unique, intimate creative 
space erupts out of nothing. Canvases, some blank, lined 
both walls in a room that should have been drafty, but wasn't. 
-The white walls were dirty and scratched from seemingly 
continuous hanging and nailing of canvases and whatever 
exhibits had come and gone over the years. Open ladders 
waited to be used and hidden artwork waited to be hung.
Most of the actors had local ties to the community. Joanna 
Lowe, who played Inez, founded Cup-A-Jo Productions in 
2004 and along with Everett Lowe, Amanda Dugan, Gregory 
Caridi, Jaime Slavinsky, and Chelsea Kirch, performed a 
remarkably humorous rendition of No Exit. The play was
introduced with the kind of joke expected of a high school 
student who did outside reading after the teacher touched 
on existentialism: Sorry for the delay. We were waiting for 
one of our subscribers. Mr. Godot is not coming." (A reference 
to Samuel Becketts Waiting for Godot, a play with almost 
identical themes.)
Dugan, who played the Valet, a man in the original text, 
revealed no emotion, as required by a keeper of lost souls. The 
play opened with her escorting Garcin, played by Caridi, to an 
empty hotel room with no windows or mirrors, which we soon 
discover to be Hell. Garcin is followed by Inez, and then the 
beautiful and feminine Estelle (Slavinsky). The three torture 
each other throughout the play by preying on each others 
vulnerabilities and evil deeds, all the while aware of what they 
are doing. This awareness is also what makes them stop. In 
one of the play's most comical scenes, Estelle attempts to 
murder the (already dead) Inez. The bulk of the interactions 
depicted in the 90-minute show, its safe to assume, are likely 
to repeat for all of eternity.
Those who have read Sartre's play consider it the classic 
existential text. Sartres existentialism, however, has slightly 
different facets from the existentialism that is prevalent
today. Sartre believed that man defined the meaning of his 
own life in a purposeless world through existing. Existence 
precedes essence," which was uttered by Sartre himself, 
much better defines what existentialism is. Another major 
aspect of Sartre's existentialism is the belief that humans 
are condemned to freedom and responsibility for their own 
actions.
Aside from the ringing cell phone and the loud whisper,
What is a cad?", the evening was enjoyable and the play was 
entertaining. Its a rare occasion when the torturous nature of 
human relationships is approached with such humor.

A Tony Award-winning actor and playwright, 
a prominent figure in the struggle against 
apartheid, a survivor of an attempted 
assassination, a spokesperson in his country for 
AIDS awareness and prevention, a captivating 
orator, a father, and a model of ubuntu  the 
South African philosophy of togetherness and 
peace  Kani brought with him an entourage 
of his accomplishments, collectively packaged 
in the form of a humble, 62-year-old man 
dressed in tennis shoes and a windbreaker.
When the applause finally began to 
subside, notebook pages fluttered, 
pencils stood poised, and 
a hundred pairs of 
eyes belonging 
to students 
and faculty 
members 
alike stared
But Bradley remains confident that Kanis stay in Pittsburgh 
was a success. "Hes really, I think, affected the lives 
of everybody hes touched here," she said, adding that 
she's received positive feedback from students in and 
out of the School of Drama, in addition to members of the 
larger Pittsburgh community, including a local Baptist 
congregation. The personal life story apart from his 
contribution as an artist is pretty extraordinary," Bradley said. 
We dont have too many legitimate heroes.
For Kani, its all in a days work. My job is to entertain, 
inform, and educate, he said. Writing and acting in plays, 
Kani explained, is similar to the creation of a painting; he 
manufactures the work of art, and it is up to the audience to 
pick out the meaning.
I believe in the power of the'word and I believe in the power 
of the art," Kani continued. As presented to the public, 
he added, the domains of theater and politics are often 
hopelessly intertwined. Kani criticized leaders for winning" 
support based on presentation and rhetoric, whereas works of 
art rely on the depth behind every show-stopping monologue 
and witty retort.
Kani considers it his duty to push the issues once again to 
the forefront of the public consciousness. But people have to 
be engaged; as a writer, he cannot simply teach his audience 
members a lesson, Kani explained. Instead, he has to tell 
them a story.
It was Antigone, an ancient 
Greek play penned by 
Sophocles, that first ignited 
Kanis interest in 
the stage. In the 
story, Oedipus's 
sons Eteocles 
and Polynices 
slay one another in 
a fight for control 
of the kingdom 
of Thebes. After 
that, King Creon 
rules that Polynices, who 
had been in exile prior to thefight, is unworthy of a burial. 
But Polynices' sister Antigone 
defies the order, and as a 
result is sentenced to die alone 
while imprisoned in a cave.
At its close, Antigone poses a 
difficult question: Do unjust laws deserve to be
Before hed even said a word, visiting 
dramatist John Kani received a 
standing ovation from the nearly 
packed Philip Chosky Theater in 
Purnell. Lecturing on the afternoon 
of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Kani 
was perhaps the physical embodiment 
of the phrase his reputation precedes 
him. And there it was: As Kani emerged 
onto the stage and took his first few steps 
towards the podium, there was almost too 
much to clap for.
'intently, like teams of spotlights, ablaze with readiness and 
utter fascination.
I would have taken John Kani whenever he was prepared to 
come, said Elizabeth Bradley, head of the School of Drama. 
Kani was a guest to the university all of last week: lecturing, 
dropping in on classes, and even making stops in some of 
Pittsburghs neighborhoods. Because his visit fell on the first 
week of the semester (sandwiched between two back-toback commitments to film and two to theater), it was slightly 
more difficult to coordinate his activities, especially given the 
holiday.

---------------------------------------------------

broken? To Kani, Antigones struggle mirrored life under 
apartheid, the former political ideology of South Africa that 
mandated racial segregation. The law was unjust," Kani 
said. The government was unjust. It was right to break that 
law." After being exposed to Antigone, Kani realized that the 
theater was more than just a form of entertainment; it was a 
platform to communicate important ideas.
In 1975, Kani won a Tony Award alongside fellow actor and 
playwright Winston Ntshona in recognition of Sizwe Banzi 
is Dead and The Island, two plays exposing apartheid for its 
brutal restrictions. In Sizwe Banzi, the title character is unable 
to return to South Africa without a set of working papers. 
Under apartheid, non-whites were required to carry proper 
identification at all times. Desperate and without options, 
Sizwe Banzi decides to assume the identity of a dead man.
The play explores the protagonists moral ambiguity as he 
attempts to better his life, even if it means disrespecting the 
deceased.
Kani and Ntshona worked with Athol Fugard, another South 
African dramatist, to write The Island. The play takes place on 
Robben Island, a location off the coast of Cape Town, which, 
under apartheid, was used to hold political prisoners. Robben 
Island, like the rest of South Africa, was racially segregated 
during apartheid, making its prison representative of the 
situation throughout the country. Nelson Mandela was once a 
prisoner on Robben Island, and so was one of Kanis brothers. 
The Island concerns two prisoners, chained together (as was 
the norm on Robben Island), who are preparing to perform 
Antigone in a prison-wide concert. The play ends on a 
bittersweet note, when only one of the two lead characters is 
granted freedom from imprisonment.*
So how does he do it? I never force it, Kani said. "It has to 
visit me. The process, he explained, is similar to having a 
child. A writer can try and try for months without success, 
until finally  in Kani's words  an idea begins to kick. 
And suddenly," he said, theres an urge of the story that 
needs to be told.
In particular, Kani writes in bouts, until his arm is sore enough 
to make him stop. He never rereads until finishing a given 
draft, and even then its after letting it sit for at least a week. 
Im amazed at some of the things I say, added Kani, who 
stressed that brilliant lines may not immediately appear as 
such. It wasnt Shakespeare who decided that To be or not 
to be was destined for literary memorability, Kani pointed 
out; it was his audience. "Thats the beauty of writing, he 
said. Kanis works usually involve three drafts, and from start 
to finish the creation of each play takes anywhere from three 
months to a year.
As much as Kani knows.about writing, hes likely just as 
much an expert on ubuntu, a concept he once met with 
great difficulty. When the abolishment of apartheid began 
in 1990, the majority of blacks in South Africa were hungry 
for revenge. And then, Kani said, almost with an eye-roll, 
Nelson [Mandela] said we were going to opt for negotiations. 
Leader of the African National Congress, Mandela backed his 
policy of nonviolence with the notion of ubuntu, which had 
been a fundamental part of African culture for generations.
At the time, being reminded of ubuntu seemed "unfair, Kani 
recalled, when so many South Africans felt consumed with 
bitterness and hostility. It was as if Mandela was using their
own culture against them. But Kani grew to respect Mandelas 
policy. After all, he had encountered some good-intentioned 
whites in South Africa. For example, when Kani was nearly 
killed after suffering 11 stab wounds in an assassination 
attempt, it was a white doctor who saved him; while treating 
his wounds, the doctor hid Kani within a ward for infectious 
diseases.
Ubuntu stresses that all people are connected. It is the thing 
that makes us human, Kani said. Metaphorically, it means 'I 
am because we are." Under ubuntu, every person is a copy of 
God, so murder is never justified. Kani explained that ubuntu 
is rightfully universal, and that he wishes more Americans 
would embrace the concept. During his lecture, he cited the 
current archeological theory that identifies the first human 
being as a young African girl. So actually we are all Africans, 
said Kani, wearing a grin. "Youre just a little lighter than me 
is all."
Certainly, he had little trouble relating to the students of 
Carnegie.Mellon. I am bowled over by these young people, 
Kani said. "Id love to put a fence around them so theyd 
never leave [school]. In the students, Kani was able to catch 
a glimpse of a part of life he was never able to experience.  
Apartheid took the most important thing from me; it took 
away my youth, he said. I was never a child." It also stunted 
his early adulthood. Years ago, Kani was originally set to 
attend law school, but his brothers discriminatory arrest 
halted his plans.
Back in South Africa, Kani has his own young people to worry 
about. Kanis present concern is the AIDS epidemic. Right 
now, hes excited about the progress thats being made. For 
example, each day, every radio station devotes an hour of 
programming intended to improve the situation. "They say, 
Imagine an AIDS-free generation. It begins with you,  Kani 
described. Billboards are also popping up throughout the 
country, containing messages including  according to Kani
 Don't you want to see who wins world cup for FIFA in 
2010? (Also: You dont put it on, zip it up.")
But Kani insists that the people most responsible for causing 
change (or lack thereof) are the parents. During the lecture, he 
called the AIDS crisis a "self-genocide for his country. Kani 
stressed the importance of family dinners, parents talking to 
their children, and children looking up to their parents (not 
celebrities).
I normally say to my sons, Kani said,  'I have invested in 
you, and I want my money back." The "money could be. 
success in any of its forms: family, love, art  anything. 
Behind the Tony, the battle scars, and the acclaim, Kani is 
most concerned with people, one family at a time. In his 
words: We need to say, Im home, Im home/ "
At the end of Kanis lecture, those attending began to 
applaud, once again rising to their feet. This time, the 
standing ovation lasted at least twice as long.

Understanding poverty through role playing
In a new series of simulations, participants are lacking more than just a script
Will work for food. These words are seen so often that they 
have almost become a clich. Desperate, woebegone, and 
often dirty individuals sit on street corners and in doorways, 
sleeping under newspapers or in cardboard boxes, begging for 
food. Pittsburgh Social Venture Partners (PSVP) is a collection 
of volunteers dedicated to effecting long-lasting change in the 
community, which includes trying to stimulate support for the 
fight against poverty.
On January 13, PS VP organized a poverty simulation at the 
University of Pittsburgh's William Pitt Student Union. Area 
residents from all different backgrounds, races, and family 
histories entered a situation in which they were forced to 
simulate the lives of "people on the edge, as PSVP calls 
them. Participants made everyday life decisions regarding 
privileges that most people take for granted, such as eating. 
For example, in order to get food, participants had to pawn 
fake items such as televisions for small amounts of cash.
Take a walk into downtown Oakland, and there will most 
likely be someone begging for food or money. Take a trip into 
any city, big or small, and poverty is virtually everywhere. The 
reality is that poverty in America is a major issue. According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, a family with three persons, two of 
whom are under the age of 18, is considered to be under the 
poverty level if its gross annual income is less than $15,735.
In 2003,16 percent of Allegheny County residents were 
expected to be below the poverty line.
It is safe to say, then, that most people have never 
experienced poverty as destitute and hopeless as is seen on 
many city streets. But maybe people take what they have
for granted. People on the street are often seen as having 
ruined their own lives through lack of motivation to work, 
incompetence, drugs, or various other situations; poverty is 
often viewed as a choice. In contrast, many people are poor 
due to circumstances beyond their control.
Terry Beggy, director of PSVP, aims to show the difficulty in 
the lives that these people lead. Our sole purpose is to get 
the conversation going about what life is like living on the 
edge, Beggy said. This is the third simulation weve done.
' We are working to find partners to host other ones throughout 
the course of the year.
Beggy talked about the need for people to try to understand 
the lives of those who are living on the edge through 
simulation and role-playing. You wouldnt think that a 45- 
minute experience would be meaningful or lasting or have 
... an impact on you, but the experience stays with you and 
makes you really stop and think about the situations of the 
impoverished.
Emily Lawrence, a Pitt sophomore, had a different outlook on 
poverty at the end of the event. I didnt realize that once you 
are in a situation like that, its extremely hard to get out of. It's 
almost like you can't think about things in the distant future. 
You are only trying to get through the day Its really a vicious 
[cycle] that is hard to defeat.
Beggy also spoke about the governments lack of action in 
the fight against poverty. A major example she chose was the 
future cutbacks in the Port Authority Transit system. Most 
of the people who use the bus system are the working poor
Small group, big change
Alternative Break lends a hand in D.C.
They say theres no such thing as a free lunch, but when 
the only cost is spending a few hours helping those in need, 
its hard to complain. On this winter's Alternative Break 
trip to Washington, D.C., the students involved gained 
more than just self-fulfillment. Their reward: an almost-free 
lunch, provided daily by DC Central Kitchen, an organization 
committed to distributing excess food throughout the district, 
and employing the very same people theyre working to feed.
I think my favorite activity was the work we did in DC 
Central Kitchen," said Amanda Scheerbaum, advisor to 
the trip and administrative coordinator in the office of the 
Dean of Student Affairs. Scheerbaum found it inspiring to 
see the homeless and formerly homeless in the process of 
getting their lives back on track. Homelessness, Scheerbaum 
was quick to point out, can happen as the result of a single 
traumatic event or poor decision. When an individual lacks a 
supportive network of friends or family, one unlucky moment 
can lead to years on the street.
The problem [of poverty] is so big that pretty much any idea 
is accepted," Scheerbaum said. "It doesnt have to be about 
creating that huge organization or that huge project." For 
Scheerbaum, Alternative Break proved that helping out for 
even a small amount of time can be important. If everyone 
dedicated even half an hour each day, she said, the effect 
would be unbelievable.
Every morning, Scheerbaum and the four students pitched in 
at DC Central Kitchen. The group helped to sort and prepare 
food  which was better than most of what Carnegie Mellon 
has to offer in the way of grub, according to sophomore 
biology major and trip organizer Anupama Maram. It's no 
surprise, considering the food at DC Central Kitchen is not 
exclusive to the disadvantaged. A professional catering 
company, DC Central also takes on weddings and parties, 
events that double as ways to make money and earn free 
publicity. DC Central accepts many of its ingredients from 
restaurants and grocery stores in the community.
The group of students also sorted food at the Capital Area 
Food Bank in addition to visiting the homeless in an infirmary 
at the Center for Creative Nonviolence. For Maram, the 
infirmary was the highlight of the trip. Hearing stories and 
interacting with the homeless added a new dimension to their 
struggles on the street.
Maram worked with Bagmi Das  a sophomore bio-psych 
major and the trips other planner  to choose a variety of 
activities to occupy the groups five-day stay. "It ended up 
working really well, Maram said, though initially she and Das 
were worried they had scheduled an overload of activities.
That wasn't their only worry. The Alternative Break trip in 
the winter is always smaller than its counterpart in the spring
who cannot afford 
other means of 
transportation,
Beggy said. College 
students, according 
to Beggy, who also 
help constitute the 
"working poor," 
will definitely feel 
the impact with 
the demise of the 
28X. The 28X is a 
straight-forward, 
easy, affordable 
way to get to the 
airport, whether 
to fly out for an 
interview, visit a 
friend, or go home 
over vacations.
As some students 
pointed out, a 
one-way ticket 
on JetBlue from 
Pittsburgh to New
York often costs less than taking a taxi from Carnegie Mellon's 
campus to the airport. .
Its always in the hands of individuals to make change 
happen. PSVP is doing just that, one volunteer at a time.

(last years spring trip involved some 18 students), but usually 
not this small. Originally, Maram and Das had been planning 
a trip to a Native American reservation, and when the plans 
never came together, the pair had less than two months to 
propose an alternative to the alternative.
"We tried to get it [as] out as we could," Maram said. The 
change made tabling, info sessions, and other forms of 
publicity less effective than they would have been before. "I 
just hope more kids get involved in it," she added, "because 
its a pretty awesome program."
Working in small numbers does have its advantages. Maram 
never had to act like an authority figure. She said, "We were 
kind of just there as a group. After volunteering all day, the 
Breakers would go out to dinner and bond over board games, 
often going to bed by 10 or 11 p.m.
For five days of service and fun, the trip-goers had to pay only 
$50. When it comes to Alternative Break, a free lunch seems 
like it can go a long way.
