Roots of Rock and 
Roll nearly nixed
by Bary Dunn
News Editor
Two hundred students enrolled 
for the history course 79-218, Roots 
of Rock and Roll, and a number of 
students who found themselves in 
the long waitlist, were informed on 
December 23 that the class had 
been cancelled due to legal obsta
cles with MP3 file sharing via 
Blackboard.
Sharing music files was done in 
the spring of 2003 and 2001, the 
only two times the course has been 
offered. This year, however, the 
process was not as simple.
Over the last twelve months, file 
sharing has been confusing, said 
Dr. Scott Sandage, an associate pro
fessor of history and the instructor 
of the course. The legal definition 
of fair use is very unclear.
Roots of Rock and Roll covers the 
history of rock and roll between 
1920 and 1970. Over the course of 
the semester, students study music 
traditions of different cultures, and 
the way musicians stole from each 
other to establish rock and roll.
Rock and roll could never have 
evolved in an atmosphere of strict 
adherence to copyright, Sandage 
said. Music was taking others stuff 
and creating your own version.
Junior business administration 
major Ileana Hernandez, along with 
three other students enrolled in 
Roots of Rock and Roll, took the 
initiative to contact Sandage and 
express the dedication they had 
toward taking the course.
We were willing to pay extra for 
CDs that we might already have, 
and autobiographies that are really 
interesting, said Hernandez.
After having received such
encouraging e-mail from his stu
dents, Sandage sought to find a way 
to reinstate his course in the 
Carnegie Mellon course catalog. 
Sandages backup plan to have the 
students purchase multiple CDs 
seemed practical from a legal stand
point, but impractical to the stu
dents, he claimed.
The idea to buy eight or nine CDs 
for $150 seemed outrageous, said 
Sandage, who is used to requiring 
the purchase of books totaling no 
more than $20.
Though the four students who 
contacted Sandage offered to spend 
the allotted funds for the course, he 
needed to hear from the other 196 
students enrolled in his course. 
Once he received positive responses 
to the e-mail sent to his students, he 
was able to reinstate the course 
under less questionable conditions.
On December 30, a week follow
ing the course's initial cancellation, 
it was officially reinstated.
Ultimately it was the students 
who wrote to me and offered to 
help, Sandage said. Once I had 
that voice from the students, I felt I 
had a little more room with which to 
operate.
Sandage and the students had 
always wanted the course tp be 
taught, but it was just unrealistic 
under the prior conditions.
This is one of the courses you 
look forward to going to, 
Hernandez said. We need that at 
CMU.
Included in the required collec
tion is an array of blues albums from 
the 1920s, such as Ma Rainey's The 
Essential and Mississippi John Hurt's 
Avalon Blues; and a group of folk 
albums recorded during the 1960s,

Kappa
Sigma
unsolved
by Lucas Yiannatji
Personnel Manager
Due to hazing allegations made last 
semester by its Fall 2003 rush class, 
Kappa Sigma will not be holding an 
official rush this spring.
According to Robert Andre, a jun
ior in mechanical engineering and 
would-be rush chairman at Kappa 
Sigma, the fraternity is not allowed to 
put up posters or advertise for 
recruitment, but they will be hang
ing out and allowing anybody inter
ested in the fraternity to come by. 
We want people to know that were 
still here, said Andre.
The entire spring 2002 rush class 
and five out often members of the fall 
2003 pledge class withdrew last 
semester, claiming that they had been 
subjected to various acts of initiation 
which they found unacceptable. Such 
activities included chugging 24 
ounces of maple syrup, enduring 
yelling and verbal abuse at midnight 
meetings, running errands for the 
brothers late at night, and running 
through a gauntlet  an obstacle 
course in the fraternitys hallway 
through which the pledges were 
forced to run carrying a medicine ball 
and hit by punching bags. Many 
pledges received rug burns, three 
vomited, and one suffered a minor 
concussion.
I was very disappointed in the 
whole experience. [But] this was a 
house-specific problem, said one of 
the former pledges.
The initial story published in The 
Tartan on November 24 gained a 
great deal of publicity following its 
release. Bill Zlatos of the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review covered the story, as 
did ThePittsburghChannel.com. While 
Zlatos contacted Michael Murphy, 
dean of student affairs, and Adam 
Welander, Kappa Sigma president, 
Channel 4 Action News reached 
Kappa Sigmas national chapter.
Investigations are currently under
way, but so far no official actions have 
been taken by the University.

Top philanthropist 
to speak at U Pitt
by Lucas Yiannatji
Personnel Manager
Kate Rowlands, medical coordina
tor, and Dr. Gino Strada, chief sur
geon and representative of 
Emergency, an international non
profit humanitarian organization 
whose purpose is to provide medical 
aid and support to civilians of wartorn nations across the world, will 
give a lecture at the University of 
Pittsburgh this Wednesday. Strada is 
the co-founder of Emergency and was 
named by Time as one of the ten most 
influential philanthropists of the 
twentieth century.
According to a pamphlet printed by 
Emergency, there is a pressing need 
in the world to clear landmines, 
another objective of Emergency. It 
reads, Over 110 million landmines 
scattered in 67 countries. At least 
25,000 new victims each year. Many 
of these landmines are left following 
the end of military conflicts, and 
instead of serving a vital purpose for 
war, they only decimate the civilian 
populations third-world countries. 
Over the past ten years, the organiza
tion has established two hospitals 
and two rehabilitation centers in 
Kurdistan, two hospitals in 
Afghanistan, one in Cambodia and 
one in Sierra Leone. It has also set up 
25 first aid stations and has altogeth
er assisted more than 300,000 
patients.
Dr. Alberto Colombi, a local repre
sentative of Emergency, or, as he
describes it, a goodwill ambassador 
for Emergency, agreed to hold an 
interview with The Tartan to discuss 
the accomplishments of Emergency 
and Strada.
Colombi, who was a student with 
Strada, began to realize the extent of 
his work in 1996.
I was in Milan and I went to visit 
his wife. I asked her, Wheres Gino? 
and she told me, Hes in Iraq, said 
Columbi.
She then informed Colombi that 
Emergency was building a hospital in 
the area known as Kurdistan. This 
meant that Strada was caught in the 
middle of a three-way rivalry, with 
Sadaam Husseins army as well as 
two warring Kurdish factions vying 
for power.
I thought to myself, Maybe hes 
crazy, Colombi said of Strada.
Colombi then explained that 
Stradas later accomplishments con
vinced him of Emergencys merit. 
Then I saw that he built another hos
pital in Iraq, and one in Sierra Leone, 
then one in Cambodia, then one in 
Afghanistan, and I thought, Maybe 
hes not so crazy; maybe hes making 
things happen.
Colombi also explained what he 
feels it is that makes Emergency dif
ferent than other non-profit organi
zations, and ultimately so successful.
What strikes me as a novice are 
two things. One is that as they have 
grown, they have employed many of 
the victims that they have cured.

Carnegie Mellon Postal Services 
came under scrutiny last week when 
Andres Jose Bermudez posted to the 
electronic bulletin board 
cmu.misc.market that the mail office 
had thrown out his magazines over 
winter break.
According to Barbara Henderson, 
the manager of Postal Services, three 
or four bundles of magazines were 
accidentally discarded by a Postal 
Services employee during the week 
of January 5.
Henderson was away during that 
time; she learned of the lost maga
zines on January 12 when Bermudez, 
a sophomore in political science, 
posted to cmu.misc.market. 
Bermudez said that he lost ten maga
zines, including Time, U.S. News, and 
Newsweek.
There were a few bundles of mag
azines that were sitting waiting to be 
sorted and were accidentally thrown 
away, said Henderson.
The postal services worker respon
sible, whose name is unavailable, has 
been suspended for up to ten days 
pending an investigation.
Paul Leonard, a U.S. Postal 
Inspector, visited the CMU postal
office last Wednesday and spoke with 
Henderson. Leonard declined to 
speak with The Tartan, saying he is 
unable to comment during an investi
gation.
Leonard gave the CMU post office 
permission to conduct its own investi
gation in accordance with standard 
departmental procedures.
[Over winter break] I instructed 
the staff to go through all the mail
boxes and pull out old campus mail, 
said Henderson. Campus mail is mail 
from on-campus organizations such 
as Housing Services. A Postal 
Services employee removed old cam
pus mail and placed them in a 
garbage bag to be thrown out. 
However, magazines were also 
placed in the garbage bag.
Henderson does not know why the 
magazines were mistakenly added to 
the trash, but said the matter is one of 
the questions that will be raised dur
ing the investigation. According to 
Henderson, Postal Services is 100% 
sure that no first class mail was 
thrown away.
Postal Services periodically cleans 
out mailboxes of students who have 
graduated, or mailboxes that are full 
and have no room for first class mail.

President Jared Cohon speaks with sophomore Thomas Oliver, organizer of the Martin Luther King Jr. open forum.Students question MLK policy
by Alexandra Kilduff
Staffwriter
Last Thursday night, students 
flocked to Rangos Ballroom to 
attend an open forum with 
President Jared Cohon regarding 
Martin Luther King Day events. The 
forum was organized after a num
ber of complaints and questions 
regarding the half-day schedule for 
MLK had been brought to President 
Cohon; however, during the forum, 
student and faculty concerns 
encompassed not only the schedul
ing but also communication 
between students and administra
tion, the responsibilities of cultural 
groups, and campus diversity.
The forum was organized by 
sophomore Thomas Oliver. Oliver, 
an economics major, decided to cre
ate the forum after an earlier pri
vate meeting with President Cohon 
regarding the half-day schedule. 
After our conversation, Oliver 
said, I didnt completely agree with 
his reasoning, but it gave me a new 
perspective. I then realized that the 
lack of available information con
cerning President Cohons reasoning for the half day was why it was 
construed as a sign of disrespect. 
The reasoning for the half day 
given by Cohon on Thursday raised 
a great deal of questions from stu
dents in attendance. President 
Cohon explained that the half day 
(traditionally called a day on 
instead of a day off) was designed 
to offer students a chance to attend 
the MLK programming while also 
respecting Dr. Kings support of 
education and work. Some students 
interpreted it differently. Cortney 
Ricketts, a senior in business 
administration and French studies 
and the president of CMUs black 
cultural organization SPIRIT, said, 
The administration explains the 
half day in observation of Martin 
Luther King Jr.s birthday as an 
attempt to reflect on diversity while 
upholding Kings message of educa
tion and human rights. But I felt, as 
many people feel, that an over
whelming fear for the administra
tion is that a full day will allow stu
dents to flee the city.
The programs planned for 
Monday afternoon include a speech 
by former Civil Rights Commission 
Chair Mary Frances Berry, readings
and performances, community 
meetings, and a candlelight proces
sion. However, students were wor
ried about the timing of the events 
as well as their publicity. Although 
CMU distributed posters and flyers 
to local churches, high schools, and 
colleges, President Cohon admitted 
that no one checked to make sure 
publicity materials were actually 
used. He also stated that each event 
was not mandatory, that students 
could pick and choose which 
events they were interested in 
attending.
Students and faculty agreed that 
in previous years a lack of publicity 
had led to a lack of attendance. 
Diversity Advisory Council Director 
Everett Tademy stated, I believe 
that the attendance has not met our 
expectations, but I do agree with 
President Cohons point last night: 
attendance has been growing. 
Interestingly, I believe, the number 
of Pittsburgh community members 
coming to our campus for this event 
has grown more than our student, 
faculty and staff participation.

Crime & Incident
Got alight? 11/26/03,5:51 pmA 
Central Property Services employee 
called the Police Department about 
ta suspicious woman inside of the 
College of Fine Arts building.
She was first spotted in the 
Architecture Studio looking around 
the drafting tables, asking for a 
lighter. The CPS employee told her 
there were no lighters there, and 
escorted her out through the south 
entrance. She returned again via 
the north entrance, where she kept 
asking for a lighter. She was 
described as a white female, 5*4"- 
5'5", late 30s, dark hair in a pony
tail, wearing a thin black goose 
down jacket, blue jeans, and black 
boots.
A floor-by-floor check proved 
negative for anyone matching the 
description. The CPS employee said 
that she was acting desperate and 
.nervous, possibly like a crack 
head.
Assault, 12/04/03, 8:44 pm 
A CMU student was jogging on
Clyde Street when an unknown 
black male shoved him into a parked 
car. The victim then ran to his apart
ment in the Shady Oaks and called 
the campus police. The actors were 
described as two black males, 
approximately six feet tall in their 
early twenties, both wearing dark 
clothing and dark hats. Two officers 
were dispatched to investigate and 
found two black males fitting the 
clothing description at Fifth and N. 
Craig. The men stated they had seen 
two young black males in their 
twenties walking up Fifth Ave. 
towards Morewood just before they 
were stopped.
Channel 4 News Trespassing, 
12/05/03,1:58 pmThe University 
Police were notified that a TV crew 
was in a fraternity and had to be 
removed. The alleged hazing inci
dent at Kappa Sigma had attracted 
the Channel 4 News to the house to 
ask questions.
The cook let the news crew in. 
They asked to speak to the house 
president, but he was not in the 
house at the time of their arrival. 
When he did arrive at the house, he 
contacted Residence Life who told 
him that the news crew had to leave. 
He informed Channel 4 that they 
were allowed to ask questions out
side, but were not allowed into the 
house. None of the brothers spoke
with the newscaster.
The news crew filmed a small seg
ment in the quad area and left with
out incident.
Holiday Spirit, 12/07/03, 7:19 
am  Christmas lights were 
observed lit on the uppermost 
rooftop of Wean Hall. The person 
who strung them was unknown, and 
the area checked negative for any
one on the rooftop. The doors to the 
penthouse were found to be locked 
and secure, but footprints were 
found on the perimeter of the roof. It 
is not known if permission was 
granted to someone to place the 
lights there. The Wean Hall building 
manager was contacted about the 
removal of the lights.

responded to a call from the 
Community Advisor of New House 
who wanted to file a report about a 
students dumping of peanut-shaped 
package foam down the stairwell

Students take 
course on parking
(U-WIRE) COLUMBUS, Ohio  
The parking problem in and around 
The Ohio State University area has 
found a way to get right into the class
room.
But the individuals inside this 
classroom need not worry about pur
chasing a C pass or paying a $50 
parking fine. They are helping the 
University District to ease the parking 
crunch  and getting credit for it.
Twenty-one graduate students in 
the Department of City and Regional 
Planning are enrolled in a course to 
study the parking needs in the area 
now and in the future.
Jennifer Evans-Cowley, assistant 
professor in the city and regional 
planning, and second-year graduate: 
student Mark Cerana presented the 
plan to the University District 
Organization on Janurary 8 as a first 
step in alleviating the parking woes.
CRP 852, a policy and planning 
studio led by Evans-Cowley, is 
designed to give students the oppor
tunity to work directly with the com
munity to receive real-world project 
management experience. This course 
strives to help students examine the 
role of parking policy in Columbus 
and how it can be used to improve the 
livability of neighborhoods.
The area to be studied is bordered 
by Fifth Avenue to the South, 
Patterson Avenue to the North, King 
Avenue/Perry to the West and 
Summit Street to the East, said 
Andrea Phillips, spokeswoman for the 
project.
Issues that will be addressed 
throughout the study include illegal 
parking, parking needs during foot
ball Saturdays, parking permit poli
cies, and parking too close to street 
intersections or on lawns, EvansCowley said. She added that parking 
patterns will be examined and ana
lyzed during the night as well as dur
ing the day.
In the first part of the study, doorto-door interviews with residents and 
local businesses will be conducted 
and will last until Janurary 21, 
Phillips said.
Following the interviews, students 
will be conducting parking counts 
and monitoring illegal parking, she 
said.
Data and feedback are collected 
during these interviews in which the 
students, who are working in groups 
of two or three, are assigned to sepa
rate areas within the university dis
trict, Evans-Cowley said.
Illegal parking was cited as one of 
the four main problems plaguing 
the university neighborhoods, but 
CRP 852 students are hoping to rec
ommend policy alternatives to the 
city before it gets any worse.
Upon completion of the study, 
the students will compile their find
ings into a report that will provide 
policy recommendations to the city 
and university transportation 
departments. The final draft of the 
report will be presented to the 
University Area Commission at the 
March 17 meeting.
Officials reconsider 
holiday
(U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C.  
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a fed
eral holiday dedicated to the mem
ory of the fallen civil rights leader, 
whose credos of faith and nonvio
lent protest shaped the Civil Rights 
movement of the 1960s. But at 
Duke University, officials question 
whether the holiday is just an 
excuse to extend weekend revelry 
one more day.
This years celebrations will 
include community service oppor
tunities, open discussions, perfor
mances and a keynote speech by 
Harvard Law Professor Charles 
Ogletree. In light of low student 
participation rates in recent years, 
however, administrators have 
expressed concerns that students 
do not celebrate the day in the way 
they had intended.
The question has been raised 
about why we have this as a holiday 
when a lot of students are using it 
as an opportunity to take a long 
weekend off campus or a lot more 
partying or sleeping in, when it had 
been argued by students that it was 
disrespectful to Dr. King to hold 
classes, and therefore we should 
show respect for Dr. King to use the 
opportunity to educate, said 
Judith Ruderman, vice provost for 
academics and administrative ser
vices and chair of the University 
Scheduling Committee.
The University began to officially 
observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
in 1999, after Duke Student 
Government passed a resolution 
recommending the University set 
aside the day as an academic holi
day. Student organizers of this 
year's celebrations have expressed 
concern that the administration 
might be reconsidering this deci
sion, although no formal inquiry 
has yet to come before any official
committee.
In speaking with several admin
istrators, they warned me to keep in 
mind that the university wants it to 
be high participation, said senior 
Maya Washington, president of the 
Black Student Alliance and a mem
ber of the University's 2004 King 
commemoration committee. 
Initially, I'm thinking that they 
need to take everything into consid
eration. The university hasn't even 
had this holiday for 10 years  I'm 
not sure they'll be able to under
stand fully the implications of 
[such] an action.
Part of the impetus behind the 
original proposal to designate 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a hol
iday was the fact that most of 
Dukes peer institutions give stu
dents the day off.
Despite this consideration, 
administrators still question the 
validity of offering students an aca
demic holiday if they are not active
ly participating in the celebrations.
Giving students the day off does 
not mean they will automatically 
spend it in reflection about King's 
life, said Leon Dunkley, director of 
the Mary Lou Williams Center for 
Black Culture, but he cautioned 
that changing the days status could 
be interpreted as indifference on 
the part of the University.
Rabins assassin said 
to marry in prison
JERUSALEM (AP)  The killer of Israeli 
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin plans to wed in 
prison, Israels Channel Two TV reported 
Sunday.
Yigal Amir will marry Larisa Trimbobler, a 
recently divorced mother of four who has 
been visiting Amir in prison for the last year, 
the television station said, citing members of 
Amirs family.
Amir shot Rabin three times in the back 
after a peace rally in Tel Aviv on Nov. 4,1995. 
The ultra-nationalist Jew said he killed Rabin 
to . prevent a land-for-peace deal with the 
Palestinians.
Amir, who is being held in solitary confine
ment, is serving a life sentence without 
parole.
The report did not say when the wedding 
would take place. Amir and Trimbobler have 
not yet filed an official request to marry, but 
the TV report said Amir's family was delight
ed with the news.
More Taliban 
prisoners released
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)  President 
Hamid Karzai ordered the release Sunday of 
more former Taliban fighters, a highly sym
bolic move that could boost his standing and 
undermine holdouts from the ousted hard
line Islamic regime.
Karzai issued a decree saying all Afghans 
detained at the northern Sheberghan prison 
and not considered dangerous should be set 
free immediately.
It was unclear how many inmates were 
affected. Local officials said the jail holds 
more than 400 suspected Afghan Taliban.
The government hopes the move, like the 
return of millions of Afghans from exile and
the release last week of dozens of Pakistanis 
who fought with the Taliban, will help heal 
the wounds left by the latest episode in the 
countrys almost quarter-century of conflict.
They are Afghans. They have every right 
to a peaceful and respectable life in the new 
Afghanistan, presidential spokesman Jawid 
Luddin told The Associated Press. The time 
for making people suffer and jailing them 
without reason is over.
Thousands of fighters captured when U.S. 
and allied Afghan forces pushed the Taliban 
out of power were disarmed and sent home to 
their villages. Many more were killed.
But hundreds remained in the jails of com
manders from the Northern Alliance faction 
such as Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ethnic 
Uzbek warlord whose power base is 
Sheberghan.
Dostums spokesman, Faizullah Zaki, said 
Sunday that Karzai's decree would be respect
ed but declined to comment further.
Luddin said the release was unrelated to a 
request from Dostum for a top job at the 
Defense Ministry.
The prisoner release is the latest attempt by 
Karzai to ease tensions ahead of presidential 
elections to take place in June under a new 
post-Taliban constitution.
Karzai has said repeatedly that only a hand
ful of Taliban leaders were to be regarded as 
terrorists, appealing to rank-and-file support
ers to throw their energy into reconstructing 
the impoverished country.
The released prisoners could also bolster 
his standing in the former Taliban strong
holds in southern Afghanistan, where antigovernment insurgents have launched a 
string of deadly attacks since the constitution 
was passed, killing at least 45 people.
It was unclear when Pakistanis held at 
Sheberghan also might be freed. Luddin said 
they were a separate case whose fate would 
be decided later.
Forty-nine were released Thursday in a ges
ture of goodwill after the visit of Pakistani 
Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali. 
Jamali pledged to free Afghans in Pakistani 
jails.
Pakistans deputy ambassador, Abdel 
Hamid Afridi, said then that more than 500 
Pakistanis remain in Afghan prisons, most of 
them in Sheberghan.
Search for Lake Erie 
crash victims
WINDSOR, Ontario (AP)  U.S. and 
Canadian crews on Sunday searched for 10 
people believed to have been killed when a 
small regional airline plane crashed into Lake 
Erie shortly after taking off from a Canadian 
island.
The wreckage of the single-engine plane 
was spotted Saturday evening, with the plane 
nose-down in the water and surrounded by 
ice, said Paul Mulrooney, president of 
Georgian Express, the airline that owned the 
Cessna 208 Caravan.
Unfortunately, this has changed from a 
rescue mission to a recovery mission, 
Constable Brian Knowler of the Ontario 
Provincial Police in Kingsville said Sunday.
Eight men returning from a hunting trip, 
the pilot and a female friend of the pilot were 
aboard when the plane went down in snowy 
weather around 5 pm Saturday about one 
mile west of Pelee Island, 20 miles north of 
Sandusky, Ohio, authorities said.
U.S. Coast Guard officials said the pilot of 
the plane, bound from Pelee to Windsor, 
about 35 miles to the northwest, made a fran
tic radio call for help shortly after taking off.
The water temperature Sunday morning 
was about 34 degrees, and wind and snow 
flurries were forecast, with waves of 2 to 4 
feet.
The weather became a very big factor in 
our efforts, said Captain Dave Elit of the 
Canadian search and rescue coordination cen
ter at Canadian Forces Base Trenton.
The pilot was from Toronto and the passen
gers were all from southwestern Ontario, 
provincial police said.
Mulrooney did not identify the pilot but 
said he was experienced with the Cessna 
Caravan and had worked for Georgian 
Express for more than a year. The weather 
was poor down there, but from what we 
know, it is flyable type of weather, he said.
However, some island residents said they
r
thought it was odd that the plane took off in 
such poor conditions.
It was crummy weather. It snowed most of 
the day, Shawnda Bedel, 29, said in a tele
phone interview. She said she had changed 
her mind about taking a flight off the island 
Saturday.
Mulrooney said his company, based in 
Mississauga, Ontario, has up to three flights 
daily between the island and Windsor in the 
winter, when ice prevents ferries from run
ning.
Mich, mother delivers 
last of sextuplets
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP)  A woman 
pregnant with sextuplets has given birth to the 
five remaining babies more than a week after 
delivering the first, a hospital official said. The 
four boys and two girls were three months pre
mature.
Amy Van Houten delivered four babies 
Friday and one Saturday morning, Spectrum 
Hospital spokesman Bruce Rossman said 
Saturday. All were in critical condition, weigh
ing between 1 pound, 4 ounces and 2 pounds, 
1 ounce.
The babies names are Gerrit Calvin, 
Samantha Clair, Nolan Benjamin, Peyton Scott 
and Kennedy Alexis. John Paul, who was born 
Jan. 7 and weighed 1 pound, 8 ounces, also 
was listed in critical condition.
The Lord just blessed us abundantly, said 
father Ben Van Houten, a 29-year-old machine 
builder.
Six little wonderful darling children that 
from [our] perspective seem to be really 
healthy. From the doctor's perspective, they're 
in critical condition.
The mother, a 26-year-old teacher, was in 
fair condition but tired, the hospital said.
Van Houten used fertility drugs to become 
pregnant. She and her husband learned of the 
pregnancy in September, and the mother has 
been hospitalized since early December on bed 
rest.
Complications after multiple births often 
involve the proper formation of the heart, 
lungs, and brain in the newborns.

U. Pitt researchers 
pursue SARS 
vaccination
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH  Last year, 
University of Pittsburgh researchers 
completed the first published trial of a 
vaccine for severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, on monkeys, and 
they will soon be ready to test it on 
human volunteers, according to the 
leader of the research team.
Weve started writing clinical proto
cols and are moving in that direction as 
quickly as possible, said head 
researcher Dr. Andrea Gambotto, refer
ring to a clinical trial on humans.
The vaccine being tested was not 
engineered using any part of the SARS 
virus. It attempts to build immunity to 
the virus that spreads SARS by infecting 
the body with mild pathogens that are 
similar. It is impossible that volunteers 
will contract SARS from the clinical 
test.
SARS is a mysterious disease that 
causes fever, body aches, and extreme 
breathing problems.
The syndrome was never seen in 
humans before last February, when an 
outbreak occurred in China. By May, 
SARS was an international health cri
sis, having spread through internation
al air travel. The disease affected China, 
Singapore, Taiwan, and Canada most 
seriously, though more than 30 coun
tries reported SARS cases, according to 
the World Health Organization.
Quarantines and travel advisories 
halted the epidemic, but not before 774 
people died and more than 8000 were 
infected. A few cases have been report
ed in recent months, but none have 
been confirmed.
Standard antiviral drugs have not 
been effective against SARS, and 
experts are unsure of how to treat it. 
Researchers do know, however, that 
SARS is spread by a coronavirus, a 
member of the virus family that 
includes the common cold.
This finding led to the vaccine being 
tested at Pitt.
We tricked the immune system to 
generate a SARS coronavirus immunity 
using a cold virus, Gambotto 
explained.
Gambotto and his team engineered 
an adenovirus, with parts of a cold 
virus spliced into it. Adenoviruses are 
small viruses capable of infecting most 
organic cells with little discomfort to 
the test subject, making the virus type a 
valuable tool for such research.
The theory behind the vaccine was 
that the subject's immune system 
would fight the adenovirus, and then 
develop a general immunity to coronaviruses  including the one that caus
es SARS.
In June, Gambotto's team used fund
ing from the National Institutes of 
Health to test the vaccine on six rhesus 
macaques, a type of monkey. In August, 
his team discovered that the animals 
had developed a general immunity to 
coronaviruses.
In December, Gambotto and his team 
published their findings in The Lancet 
Medical Journal. This was the first pub
lished testing of a SARS vaccine, but its 
importance was somewhat reduced by 
the discovery, made a few months earli
er, that monkeys are an unsuitable test 
subject for a SARS vaccine.
Our experience working on an HIV 
vaccine showed that the closer you go 
to humans in your animal model, the 
more chance you have of finding a good 
model, but this was not the case for 
SARS, Gambotto said.
In July, when Gambotto had already 
begun to test monkeys, researchers at 
the University of Rotterdam in the 
Netherlands discovered that, even if 
infected with the SARS coronavirus, 
monkeys do not develop SARS.
The final proof that the vaccine is 
working is to challenge the animal with 
the actual virus, he said. But this was 
not possible because monkeys do not 
get sick with SARS.
In October, the researchers at 
Rotterdam discovered that ferrets are 
much more similar to humans in their 
response to the SARS coronavirus.
We are in the process of starting the 
same experiment [we did on the mon
keys] on ferrets, which is very impor
tant before we move the vaccine to 
humans, Gambotto said.
Meanwhile, Gambotto has already 
planned a trial using human volunteers 
and is waiting for the completion of the 
ferret study, approval from the Food 
and Drug Administration and addition
al funding.
His team must also engineer an ideal 
vaccine to be used in the study  the 
process could take as many as six 
months.
These are all things you do in paral
lel, so you dont wait for one or the 
other first, Gambotto said.
Gambotto acknowledged that the 
media attention concerning SARS 
might initially turn away potential vol
unteers, but he expects that volunteers 
will be comforted when they learn of 
the impossibility of contracting SARS 
and improbability that the vaccine will 
making a person ill in some other way,
Usually it is not difficult to find peo
ple who are willing to test, Gambotto 
said. But, of course, you have to inform 
them.

KING, from page A1
ing student attendance were offered 
last night; chief among them was a 
request for more direct communica
tion between planning committees 
and the students themselves.
According to Oliver, A more inti
mate approach could possibly be 
achieved by having more students 
participate in the planning and subsequendy getting their friends and 
peers to come and check it out. 
Ricketts agreed, saying that, if there 
were events organized by Student 
Activities or Student Life each year
such as a show or panel on diversity 
with representatives from each cul
tural organization, I believe that this 
would hold students more account
able and empower us to make a 
change in a community that is some
what indifferent to the issues of 
diversity. The programming commit
tee for this day should be made up of 
representatives from all cultural 
organizations, not just a few minori
ty organizations.
Others present at the meeting felt 
that the programs needed to be as 
student-oriented as possible in order 
to overcome a sense of campus apathy. To this end, student body vice 
president Gilbert DusSek explained 
that the Student Senate was working 
to arrange conferences between var
ious cultural organizations in order 
to promote a more unified and direct 
sense of diversity on campus yearround.
Students almost unanimously 
agreed that both they and the 
administration needed to address 
larger diversity issue^, not merely 
participation on MLK Day. Diversity 
is not just present on Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day, said Ricketts. Its 
every day. We need to tart living it.
Mail room under investigation
MAIL, from page Al
their mailboxes for months and it 
fills with magazines and other mail.
In this case, Postal Services 
removes the mail and places it on a 
shelf above the mailbox. They then 
e-mail the student to inform him or 
her that mail has been set aside and 
that the mailbox needs to be 
checked.
According to Henderson, first 
class mail must be sorted before 
other classes of mail, so there can 
sometimes be a delay in placing 
magazines in student mailboxes.
We follow the same guidelines as 
the U.S. Postal Service, said 
Henderson. The CMU Postal Office 
is a contractor to the U.S. Postal 
Service. The post office has 6407 
mailboxes.
One of the major concerns any 
time mail is lost is that it could hap
pen again, possibly with first class 
mail.
I think after the inspector was 
there and after such an outcry, it 
won't happen again, said Matthew 
Russo, a first-year student in CIT. 
Henderson said that new postal 
workers go through two weeks of
initial training and they also com
plete a Contract Postal Unit (CPU) 
training program.
I was annoyed, but glad they 
resolved it, said Russo, who will be 
receiving a reimbursement for his 
two missing issues of Wired 
Magazine at newsstand prices.
Henderson said that students who 
think they may have lost magazines 
should speak with her at the 
University Center post office. If a 
student has an issue With mail that's 
been lost, Id be happy to talk to 
them to find a solution, said 
Henderson.

Spring Recruitment Meeting 
5 pm Wednesday, January 21 
Connan Room (UC)
Free food if you can read.
Women, for example, in the hospital 
in Anabah, Panjshir, have been hired 
to stitch the linen of the hospital. But 
also, [Emergency] has opened up 
workshops teaching them to weld, or 
teaching them to do hand-crafts, or 
carpets, or maybe to sell seeds for 
agriculture. Thats very striking to 
me, that ability to build capacity.
Dr. Colombi also mentioned the 
fact that Emergency builds perma
nent buildings that stay with the 
communities, rather than tents or 
other temporary structures that do 
not. Also, as he pointed out, those 
hospitals serve a greater purpose 
beyond the healing of the physical 
body.
Its a great way, in my opinion, to 
diffuse hatred. If you bring real help, 
people do understand that you are 
helping them. And its also very hard 
for warring individuals to hate each 
other when theyve been in the same 
hospital.... thats how you rebuild 
relations.
The most recent Emergency project 
underway is a womens hospital in 
Afghanistan. Colombi stated that 
there is a pressing need in that coun
try for such a facility, given the diffi
culty women face trying to receive 
gynecological and maternity care.
In Europe and the U.S., the rate of 
death of women giving birth is about 
six women over 100,000 births.... in 
Afghanistan, that rate is 1700.
Massimo Bigliardo, a supporter of 
Emergency who first brought the 
news of the lecture to The Tartan, 
also commented on Dr. Strada and 
Emergency.
Dr. Gino Strada performs a surgical procedure in a hospital that he built.
[Strada] has taken quite a few 
radical positions. For example, he 
does not take money from govern
ments that are involved in war. He 
refused to take financial aid from 
Italy. That put him in a difficult situa
tion because many people probably 
didnt understand why he did it. He 
says he prefers the support of regular 
people.... he presents a new 
approach, a more grassroots
approach.
Joanne Ulringer, another represen
tative of Emergency who, along with 
Colombi, organized Stradas upcom
ing speech at the University of 
Pittsburgh, spoke to The Tartan about 
what she hopes will come out of the 
speech.
We hope that people develop a
greater awareness of the [civilian] 
consequences of conflict and the 
good work that Emergency is doing. 
And I hope that it is looked at in an 
apolitical fashion; Strada has been 
doing this [in Iraq and Afghanistan] 
before U.S. involvement. I also hope 
that they see the need that these peo
ple have and how very fortunate we 
are in the United States.
Strada is expected to discuss the 
new Maternity Center along with 
other plans for the future of 
Emergency in his speech on 
Wednesday, January 21, at the 
University of Pittsburghs Graduate 
School of Public Health, G23 Parran 
Hall. The lecture will be held from 
6:00-7:00 pm, followed immediately 
by a reception until 8:00 pm.
Rock history class reinstated
ROCK, from page Al
such as Bob Dylans Highway 61 
Revisited and Janis Joplins Pearl. Also 
required for students are The Bristol 
Sessions, Volume 1, and music from 
Alan Lomax, Johnny Cash, and Jimi 
Hendrix.
Roots of Rock and Roll was created 
primarily for history majors and 
minors, who may take the course to 
fulfill a history elective. Nonetheless, 
all students at Carnegie Mellon are 
able to enroll.
The purpose of the course is to use 
music as a means of studying histo
ry, said Sandage.
Dain Pascocello, a graduate of 
CMUs social and cultural history pro
gram who took the course last spring,
expressed his admiration toward Dr. 
Sandages ability to teach Roots of 
Rock and Roll.
Dr. Sandage has a unique ability 
to distill big themes into easily 
digestible parts, Pascocello said. 
Ive had more than one class with 
him; he is the most student-oriented 
teacher we have.
Though the course was reinstated, 
the problems associated with file 
sharing went unsolved.
As the legal situation became 
murkier over the last twelve months, 
Dr. Sandage and Carnegie Mellon 
were no longer comfortable with 
what was, in the short term, techno
logically possible.
Joel Smith, vice provost and chief 
information officer for Computing
Services, said that the problems with 
file sharing will not be resolved until 
the courts address them.
I think [the decision] is going to 
be pretty soon, said Smith, who 
strongly advocates the sharing of 
music files for educational purposes, 
such as with Roots of Rock and Roll. 
Smith added bluntly, Fair use should 
be a legal activity.
Irrespective of the ultimate legal 
outcome with file sharing, Dr. 
Sandage and his students will at least 
be able to study the roots of rock and 
roll and how they have shaped our 
history.
Editors Note: Dain Pascocello is a 
former Forum Editor for The Tartan. 
He graduated in 2003.

NASA abandons 
Hubble telescope
NASA retired the Hubble Space 
Telescope as part of broader policy 
changes designed to advance 
President Bushs plans to send 
humans to the Moon, Mars, and 
beyond. The Hubble Telescope, 
which was revolutionary when it 
was launched and which increased 
scientists knowledge of the uni
verse, will no longer receive essen
tial servicing and will eventually 
degrade on its own.
NASA administrator Sean 
OKeefe decided to scrap future 
missions to the Hubble because of 
time constraints relating to the 
space shuttles retirement, project
ed to happen in 2010. Most future 
shuttle missions will be to the 
International Space Station.

Monkeys under
stand grammar
Scientists who researched a 
group of monkeys better under
stand why humans became the 
only animals to evolve language. 
The January 16 issue of Science 
reported that although monkeys 
understand basic rules of gram
mar, they cannot understand some 
of humans more complex gram
matical structures.
Previously, researchers showed 
that tamarin monkeys were capa
ble of understanding simple rules 
to figure out the kinds of word 
pairs that belong together. In the 
new study, W. Tecumseh Fitch and 
Marc D. Hauser analyzed whether 
monkeys could understand sen
tences in which related words 
were separated. They discovered 
that monkeys reacted only when 
simple rules were broken.

Google to launch 
e-mail with IPO
Google, Inc., the current leader 
in the search engine market, could 
merge its profitable keywordbased advertising with an e-mail 
service soon, according to sources 
familiar with the matter.
Development of the project fol
lows a number of e-mail-related 
purchases by Google and the 
launch should coincide with the 
companys widely anticipated IPO, 
which is expected to come out 
later this year.
The addition of a branded email service could advance 
Googles position in the market 
against competitors such as Yahoo! 
and MSN, Microsofts Internet 
division, and the move could help 
the company mitigate the effect of 
its diminishing lead in the search

Chinas rapidly-growing space

competition in the future, though 
no Russian-style space race exists 
yet.
Following the successful space 
flight of Chinese astronaut Yang 
Liwei last October, Chinese offi
cials began planning missions to 
the Moon and Mars.
After Yangs successful space 
journey, the Chinese space pro

satellites this year and hopes to 
launch an unmanned lunar satel
lite by 2007 and an unmanned 
lunar landing vehicle by 2010, 
according to the official Xinhua 
news agency.
China says it will cooperate with 
the U.S. and other countries on 
space exploration. Many analysts 
believe that a Sino-U.S. space 
rivalry could drive research on 
both sides healthily, but some 
White House hawks consider the 
Chinese space program a warning.
Yangs trip made China the third 
nation to send a man into space.

Compiled by 
Kevin ChangHow things work:
Rusting cars and road de-icers
rmw nIIumll
Its that time of year again; snow 
is falling and cars are filthy.
Well-meaning but irresponsible 
local governments are spreading 
excessive amounts of salt on the 
roads whether its likely to melt 
snow or not. (Salt is a very ineffec
tive de-icer, especially outside of the 
narrow temperature range in which 
its actually useful.) What salt does 
do is induce rust in steel cars, be 
they rare classics or hard-earned 
workhorses. Even aluminum Land 
Rovers and plastic Saturns have 
steel frames that are susceptible to 
rust. Read on to find out how rust 
works.
Rust is just a convenient term for 
iron oxide. As the name implies, this 
compound consists of the elements 
iron and oxygen. Iron, of course, is 
the primary ingredient in steel. 
When iron rusts, or becomes iron 
oxide, it is both the anode and the 
cathode in an electrochemical 
process, meaning that the area that 
is rusting is giving up electrons to 
another area of the metal. The other 
key player is called the electrolyte. 
Water or carbonic acid plays the role 
of the electrolyte. (The carbonic 
acid comes from water combining 
with carbon dioxide in the atmos
phere.)
What happens when a corrosive 
process occurs is this: the acid starts 
to dissolve the metal, and the elec
trolyte (water) provides oxygen 
atoms to the anode, freeing elec
trons. The oxygen bonds with iron 
atoms in the dissolving metal. The 
freed electrons flow from the 
anode, through the electrolyte, to 
the cathode.
As electrons flow from the anode 
to the cathode, the metal of the 
anode is slowly converted into the 
iron oxide that we call rust. So 
what? Well, besides being weaker 
than steel, the iron oxide takes up 
more space than the steel that it 
replaces, so the material can break 
itself apart. Thats why rust is such a 
problem.
Rusting is accelerated in the pres
ence of salt because dissolved salt 
increases the conductivity of the
carbonic acid, so more electrons 
flow and more steel is dissolved, 
leaving iron oxide. This is why cars 
rust much faster in areas where irre
sponsible governments dump salt 
on the road in a vain attempt to melt 
snow.
Other de-icers are more effective, 
work over a broader temperature 
range, are less rust-inducing, and 
better for the environment. 
Unfortunately, those chemicals are 
also more expensive, so reckless 
overuse of salt is the weapon of 
choice to combat icy roads in many 
areas, and cars rust as a result.
Why do only certain metals rust? 
The easy answer is that they contain 
iron, and metals that dont contain 
iron dont rust. Stainless steel, howr
ever, is a notable exception, since 
its iron-based just like any other 
steel, yet is very resistant to corro
sion. Stainless steels are made up of 
at least 12% chromium. The nice 
thing about chromium is that its 
molecules are about the same size 
as those of the oxides it forms in the 
presence of oxygen. So instead of 
flaking off and breaking apart like 
rusted metal does, the very benefi
cial corrosion that occurs on the sur
face of stainless steel forms a tightly 
packed protective layer that blocks 
further corrosion. Some stainless 
steel is even treated with nitric acid 
to remove some of the iron content 
from the surface, so that the mater
ial exposed to the atmosphere is 
largely chromium.
Speechalator translates Arabic

an e-mail to The Tartan.
Right now, the device only works 
in the domain of doctor-patient inter
views, but the researchers plan to 
incorporate different modules.
Planned modules include one for 
booking a hotel room and one for reg
istering for a conference, Waibel said 
in Technology Research News midDecember issue.
Tongues ability to translate was 
limited because it had to be able to 
translate general knowledge. 
Because Speechalators domain is 
limited to medical interviews, its 
translation software is of higher qual
ity.
The Speechalator has three main 
components: a speech recognizer, 
which listens the to the input audio 
and converts it to text; a translation 
engine, which translates the text 
from one language into another; and 
a speech synthesizer, which takes 
translated text and coverts it to 
speech in that language.
You need two recognizers, two 
synthesizers and two translators to 
make [it] happen in both directions, 
Waibel told Technology Research 
News.
According to Frederking, a major 
challenge for the researchers was 
putting the software onto a PDA, 
which is much less powerful than 
even a small laptop. These PDAs are 
not strong in processor power or 
processor memory, said Schultz.
The researchers overcame that
problem by partnering with CMU 
spinoff company Multimodal 
Technologies, which had developed 
speech recognition for PDAs, as well 
as by a clever technical trick in port
ing the translation software to the 
PDA, wrote Frederking.
One early question the researchers 
faced was what dialect of Arabic to 
use. Although there is a standard 
written form for Arabic, Modern 
Standard Arabic, it is not normally 
used for conversation  Schultz 
called it the language you get on TV 
news shows. As they were specifical
ly interested in spoken languagetranslation, they decided to choose a 
major spoken dialect  Egyptian 
Arabic. We were forced to look for 
people who knew the language, said 
Schultz.
We were basically pushed to cre
ate an engine in six months in a lan
guage we didnt know, Schultz said.
Learning Egyptian Arabic was diffi
cult, Black acknowledged in an email. We had a number of sessions 
where native Arabic speakers helped 
the team learn the phonetics, writing 
system, and some words in the sys
tem.
The researchers wrote in their 
paper that because Speechalator 
could later be used by the military 
for unspecified use, their original 
Arabic speaker was slightly reluc
tant to have his voice used in a 
device that might be used by the US 
military in his home country.
Because of this concern, a different 
Arabic speaker  a U.S. citizen who 
had previously worked for the mili
tary  was used for the final record
ings.
In the future, wrote Black, we will 
design voices that do not necessarily 
sound like the original person.
Another issue is that the translator 
must convey the right tone, Black 
told Federal Computer Week in 
September 2002. If you are telling

Devices to translate speech into 
any language, like Douglas Adams 
Babel fish or Star Treks Universal 
Translator, used to be the stuff of sci
ence fiction. Indeed, one NASA scien
tist writes of the Universal Translator 
on his website
http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/justjorJun/startrek.html, We 
can certainly dismiss the possibility 
of such an invention ever being 
built.
Meanwhile, the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
became interested after 9/11 in 
speeding up the development of a 
handheld device that could translate 
speech in the field. To that end, its 
Babylon project involves four partici
pants, one of which is Carnegie 
Mellon.
Researchers from CMU and three 
spinoff companies have developed 
the Speechalator, which translates 
English speech to Arabic and vice 
versa, with over 80 percent accuracy 
in informal tests.
The Speechalator team includes 
Alex Waibel, associate director of 
CMUs Language Technologies 
Institute (LTI); Alan Black, an associ
ate research professor at LTI; Robert 
Frederking, a senior systems scientist 
at LTI; and Tanja Schultz, a research 
computer scientist at LTI.
The companies involved are 
Multimodal Technologies Inc.; 
Cepstral, LLC, of which Black is a 
founder; and Mobile Technologies 
Inc., of which Waibel is a founder.
The researchers presented the 
Speechalator in a paper (found at 
http://www. cs. emu. edu/~awb/paper 
s/eurospeech2003/speechalator) at 
the Eurospeech 2003 conference 
held last September in Geneva, 
Switzerland.

lation has to be suitable so it appears

The teams next step is testing

Frederking wrote that he was inter
ested in getting it from a working 
demo to the point where you could 
try really using it in the field.
It could be used for medical inter
views in refugee camps, but we need
to evaluate it further to ensure its 
actually helpful and not just a piece 
of geek technology that appears cool 
to us, Black wrote.
Field tests will help us make it 
actually useful, he said.
One day, the Speechalator may 
indeed function as a universal trans
lator. The researchers are well on 
their way. Wrote Black, We have 
started looking at Thai.

Olympic committee fails to 
recognize New Yorks flaws
; * This month marks the deadline for applying
 to be a candidate city for the 2012 Summer 
> (Olympics, and the U.S. Olympic Committee 
^iJSOC) will be applying on behalf of New 
York City. New York beat out San Francisco to 
be our candidate for the Games in an elimi
nation process that had previously removed 
Houston, Washington D.C., Cincinnati, and 
others from competition. New Yorks selection 
as a finalist came hastily following the terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001, when pro-New 
York City sentiment ran through the veins of 
most Americans; despite these feelings, New 
York fails to meet several criteria necessary in 
a host city.
The Games of the Olympiad are supposed 
to be memorable for their host, a city whose 
residents lives revolve around the Games dur
ing the two weeks they are open. Cities such as 
Salt Lake City, Lake Placid, and even Atlanta 
some degree engulfed their residents in 
^lympic activity. Is there any indication among 
<4he various bid documents that New Yorkers 
will find thousands of athletes, coaches and 
"members of the press to be anything other 
than an immense inconvenience?
The bid as currently written and printed 
by NYC2012, the agency charged with apply
ing to the USOC and International Olympic 
Committee (IOC), calls for Olympic venues 
to be spread throughout the region. From 
Olympic Stadium, a multi-billion dollar edi
fice-in-planning for Manhattans West Side 
(and future home of the once again properly 
named New York Jets), they will stretch out as 
far west as the New Jersey Meadowlands, and 
as far east as the Nassau Coliseum on Long 
Island. They will include arenas in all five 
boroughs of the city, with the Olympic Village 
situated in Long Island City, Queens.
With such widespread sites, New Yorkers 
will suffer two great blows. The first is the 
jamming of extant transit facilities and their 
already clogged urban thoroughfares to by 
those transferring between Olympic locations. 
This will potentially cripple New Yorks trans
portation infrastructure unless drastically
expensive alternatives are built specifically 
for athletes. The second will be removing the 
Olympics from local culture. If New York is 
to be selected as host city, its residents, too 
engaged in their self-important business and 
without a sense of Olympic cohesion, will 
barely have any view of the Olympics except 
those things that eventually inconvenience 
them.
Granting a city the honor of hosting the 
Olympics offers that city an opportunity to 
revitalize and reveal itself to the rest of the 
world. New York is not in need of either of 
these benefits. The federal government has 
already mandated the rebuilding of that which 
was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks, 
but economically, it remains one of the stron
gest cities in the nation and is not in need of 
the boon the Games bring. The international 
view of New York will be redundant as people 
around the world can easily recognize New 
York through the innumerable films, televi
sion programs, and such globally recognizable 
events as the Times Square ball drop that are 
set there. The city is already the entire basis 
of many foreigners knowledge of the United 
States. With so many American cities in dire 
economic crises and in need of broad expo
sure, New York is monopolizing the spotlight.
Following their formal application, which 
was due Thursday, New York will compete 
internationally with cities proffered by foreign 
Olympic committees. Among the other eight 
candidates are three cities looking to repeat 
as summer Olympic host and Havana, Cuba, 
which is being considered in spite of the impli
cations of the United States embargo on unnec
essary travel and trade there. Consequently, 
NYC2012s bid, however flawed, is going to 
shine through as one of the likely choices 
among those cities. Hopefully by the 2005 
selection deadline, the clouded judgment and 
sentimentality that discarded San Francisco 
as USOC selection will have dissipated further 
and the IOC will see New York as the infeasible 
candidate city it is.
US Airways threat to airport 
insulting to citizens of Pittsburgh
The saga continues. Relations between 
Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) and 
US Airways took a turn for the worse with the 
airlines recent threat to pull its hub out of PIT. 
US Airways cited high passenger boarding 
costs as the immediate reason, but the circum
stances are more complicated. US Airways 
has maintained a longstanding presence in 
Pittsburgh and enjoyed special treatment from 
local authorities. Pulling out of Pittsburgh 
International Airport would represent an egre
gious insult to the city.
Pittsburghs modern, 125-gate airport was 
completed in 1992 at a cost of $1 billion, with 
the goal of keeping US Airways and 8000 jobs 
in the region. US Airways has been allotted 
half of the gates at this airport since its con
struction. In fact, much of the airport design 
is per US Airways specifications. In an period 
of weak economy combined with the recent 
terrorist attacks, the airline industry is strug
gling and US Airways is no exception; the 
company emerged from bankruptcy in March 
2003. However, immediately before ending its 
bankruptcy, the airline asked for concessions 
from the City of Pittsburgh on the $62 million 
it pays annually and scrapped its lease.
Most observers anticipated US Airways 
threat to flee PIT. Last fall, US Airways asked 
for even more help from Pittsburgh, a city 
with no better of a financial situation. The 
airline was wondering if the city might be kind 
enough to assume $500 million of the $672 
million the company still owes for the financ
ing of the airport.
In spite of Pittsburghs strategic location 
within a two-hour flight of over 50 percent of 
the nations population, US Airways operation 
does not require it. With a second hub only 
300 miles away in Philadelphia, PIT becomes 
^substantially redundant. Further, local tax 
structures make doing business in Pittsburgh
is significantly more expensive than other cit
ies, creating a disincentive for locating here. 
However, US Airways owes much to Pittsburgh 
for all the accommodations and incentives that 
were bestowed upon the company.
Beyond amounting to a slap in the face to 
Pittsburghs good-faith efforts, the city can 
ill afford to lose US Airways hub. Even in the 
wake of recent negotiations between county 
executive Dan Onorato and discount carri
ers such as JetBlue, industry sources feel it 
remains highly unlikely any other airline would 
consider opening a hub matching the scope of 
US Airways. Assuming the City of Pittsburgh 
does not help out, the airport would be stuck 
with all of US Airways $672 million debt.
Such expense would be passed on to airport 
customers in the form of higher airport fees. 
An exit by US Airways would also result in 
the loss of numerous jobs and indirect losses 
from thousands of passengers no longer pass
ing through the airport. Allegheny County 
Airport Authority spokesperson JoAnn Jenny 
has stated that the airport has cash reserves to 
stay afloat for only two years following a US 
Airways withdrawal. The potential danger is 
severe enough that Pennsylvania state officials 
have been meeting with the airline.
US Airways continues to push the envelope 
on what it can extract from the city and airport 
authorities. Their greed needs to end. Their 
latest request to cancel airport construction 
debt goes too far; it effectively demands that 
the new airport be free. Amidst the local fiscal 
difficulty in a city that is being forced to cut 
emergency services to stay solvent, US Airways 
follows the path of a rat fleeing the proverbial 
sinking ship. A reasonable compromise can be 
struck to keep US Airways here for everyones 
benefit. This is one love-hate relationship that 
must be salvaged.

Media focus inappropriate for election
Jonathan Mendelson
This election cycle, the news media seems 
to be wholly focused on finding the most 
entertaining political story, rather than try
ing to fairly and accurately report about 
candidates seeking the highest office in the 
United States. Argyle sweaters dont have 
much in common with tax cuts and foreign 
policy, but that hasnt stopped newspapers 
from obsessing about Wesley Clarks new 
wardrobe and how this might make the 
retired general more appealing to women 
voters. In the search to find the next big 
story about the 2004 Democratic primaries, 
newspapers have dabbled on the irrelevant, 
fudged the facts, obsessed over the polls, 
and generally abandoned any pretense of 
journalistic integrity.
In our current primary system, there 
exists an invisible primary before any 
votes are cast in which campaigns fight for 
money, media, and momentum. This invis
ible primary gives great power to the news 
media, as most people get their news from 
second degree sources. Unfortunately, the 
media obsess with the polls and look for the 
slightest sign that a candidate has momen
tum. A shift within a polls margin of error 
can create buzz, creating a snowball effect 
by increasing campaign donations, and in 
turn generating stories about the candi
date's fundraising success. Front-runners 
are created, and candidates with lower poll 
support have a difficult time raising money 
and gaining endorsements.
To a certain extent, polls long before 
elections dont mean much. Political vet
erans will quickly caution that a year is 
a political lifetime, and that things can 
quickly change. The last two Democrats to 
be elected President, Jimmy Carter and Bill
Clinton, both rose up to national promi
nence after being little-known governors.. 
Approval ratings can also be misleading. 
Former President George Bush surged to an 
89 percent approval rating shortly after the 
Persian Gulf War, and even in June 1992, 
Donald Lambro of the Washington Times 
reported that many Democrats had serious 
doubts about Bill Clintons electability, with 
a veteran Democratic strategist saying The 
halls of Congress are filled with Democrats 
wringing their hands over their prospective 
nominee.
On the other hand, it is impossible to deny 
that polls and the medias reporting of them 
have a significant impact on how voters 
feel about candidates. Early in this elec
tion cycle, Dennis Kucinich, Carol Moseley 
Braun, and Al Sharpton were deemed by 
the media as marginal candidates, and they 
have since been struggling to prove their 
viability, to no avail, since the media have 
largely ignored their presence. Howard 
Dean was also deemed marginal, but he 
was able to bypass the traditional media, 
getting his message out through the Internet 
and through his large grassroots campaign. 
He drew large crowds and raised enough 
money to finally get noticed.
In fact, by the end of the year, his impres
sive grassroots support, fundraising abili
ties, and endorsement by Al Gore led to 
a rise in the polls and the presumption 
by many in the medias punditocracy that 
the race was all but over, despite the fact 
that no votes had been cast. At this point, 
it began examining Howard Dean under a 
microscope, questioning everything from 
his electability to the fact that his wife, a 
doctor, spends time with patients rather 
than reporters. The media branded him 
as an anti-war liberal despite the fact that 
he governed in Vermont as a centrist. It 
has called him angry and aggressive even 
though there havent been actual incidents 
in which he acted out in anger, and even
though our current President, not com
monly portrayed as aggressive, told Iraqi 
insurgents to bring it on.
Some people claim that the media are 
trying to avoid a nightmare situation in 
which Dean quickly and easily locks up 
the nomination, an unexciting end to the 
campaign that would give less interesting 
news coverage than a long, drawn-out fight. 
This is certainly a possibility, as research 
by the nonpartisan Center for Media and 
Public Affairs found only 49 percent positive 
coverage of Dean but 78 percent positive 
coverage for other Democrats in broadcast 
networks covering the race. Even if this 
is not the case, there is a lack of account
ability for reporters who dont stick to facts. 
Associated Press writer Calvin Woodward, 
who a few years ago essentially called Al 
Gore a liar for saying statements which were 
provably true, was back this election cycle, 
writing in a January 4 editorial masquerad
ing as news that the Democratic candidates 
were all liars.
Still, there is hope that things will improve. 
Thanks to the recent phenomenon of blog
ging, wherein a person can keep an online 
journal with links and commentary, anyone 
can instantly become a political pundit. The 
emergence of political blogs is quite strik
ing, and they have the potential to become 
a democratizing force, allowing anyone to 
report their own opinions or exhibit factual 
inaccuracies in traditional news media that 
normally go unnoticed. Even more recently, 
a number of media watchdog blogs have 
emerged. The more aware people are of the 
hidden biases of the news media, and the 
more they demand accurate reporting, the 
more likely it is that the media will change 
their bad habits.

Dems Anti-Bush rhetoric
How Presidential hopefuls are subverting each others campaigns though excessive political attacks
Ben Hackett
These Democratic candidates spit venom, 
really they do. Mudslinging is common 
in the latter parts of elections. However, 
it is quite rare that it begins so early and 
occurs so often as it has in the Democratic 
primary race this year, a full year before the 
Presidential election. Sinking their teeth 
in with the tenacity of a rabid dog, they 
consistently attack without offering any 
solutions.
The virulent Howard Dean is on the 
attack, as is the French-looking Kerry and 
the apathetic Gephardt.
When verbally slashing Bush is not occur
ring, the candidates often turn their stares 
onto assumed national frontrunner Howard 
Dean. In fact, it was only three days before 
the Iowa primary election that they agreed 
to pull their attack ads on each other. Almost 
arrogant in their ignorance, the candidates 
keep attacking policies formed by the Bush 
administration that they formerly supported 
themselves, or supported when Democrats 
were in control.
For instance, the policy of regime change 
has been the official U.S. policy ever since 
Bill Clinton said as much during his second 
term in office. However, if you listen to
the Democratic candidates now, especially 
Wesley Clark, who spoke in favor of regime 
change in Iraq, one would assume that the 
policy of these Democrats was never in line 
with any of the war supporters.
Realistically, the viewpoint has changed 
due to petty vote pandering. The spineless 
liberals  always inconsistent and never 
original  have drifted towards the far left 
of their party faithful. The far left voters 
are the ones found in the early primaries of 
Iowa and New Hampshire. Thus, the man
tra shift of these candidates is no surprise.
Democrats even accuse Bush on his stron
gest points: military and homeland defense. 
Bush has been busy in creating a Homeland 
Security Department and spending billions 
to screen airline passengers and secure the 
nations airports. The Democrats maintain 
that the Bush administration failed to pro
tect the nation against the threat of terror
ism, and Democrats often get the Hollywood 
assist. In fact, many Bush-bashing parties 
have been helped all around in Los Angeles 
and New York. They serve to run fundraisers 
and forums for angry out-of-power liberals. 
These same people are the ones who never 
hatch new ideas, and only dig at others 
attempts.
Their attacks do not stop at the President. 
Democratic representative Jerry Costello 
(D-Ill.) said at a Gephardt rally, Could you 
imagine what the Republicans would be 
doing to a Democratic president who was a
CEO of a company that now has gotten bil
lions of dollars worth of contracts  no-bid 
contracts  without competition?
There would be hearings day after day. 
And my prediction to you is that you will 
see in this session of Congress that begins 
on Tuesday, there will not only be hearings 
but I think there ought to be impeachment 
hearings.
Essentially, they were asking for an 
impeachment hearing on Dick Cheney. 
Though that idea would not be popular to 
the mainstream, it is a great rallying cry for 
fundraisers and party events.
And that is what the Democratic prima
ries are all about: empty rhetoric for party 
faithful. Realistically, most people think that 
George W. Bush will have no problem roll
ing over the competition in 2004. Increasing 
the social divide with their fierce words will 
prove counterproductive when election time 
rolls around. People, already divisive and 
divided, will only be pushed further towards 
both sides. With their far-leftist stances, 
except for Lieberman, they are also pushing 
members of their own party to another can
didate, potentially George W. Bush.

University overstepping bounds on holiday events
Adam Greenberg
Once again, the University decided 
to continue its five-year-old policy of 
only closing for part of the afternoon 
to celebrate the holiday commemo
rating civil rights leader Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. The University fills 
those afternoon hours with pro
grams devoted to carrying on the 
spirit of Dr. King: equality and diver
sity. Effectively, the University is 
attempting to guide the celebration 
of students towards what it feels they 
should do with the holiday.
With public schools, banks, gov
ernment offices, and even other uni
versities closing the full day, Carnegie 
Mellon lags well behind the curve by 
scheduling it this way. Other institu
tions closed for the entire day do not 
feel it necessary to promote celebra
tions for their released students and 
employees; in fact, CMU does not 
do so for other breaks. For example, 
the University has decided that in 
rescheduling our spring break this 
year, they should grant us one extra 
day off for Presidents Day, not a 
partial day so we can attend lectures 
and events related to the spirit of the 
day.
Various University officials defend
ing this policy have claimed that the 
break would come too soon after 
another one and that many students 
would view it as an opportunity not
to celebrate Dr. Kings life and mis
sion, but rather as an extra night 
to party, an extra-long weekend to 
return home. While it is true that due 
to our scheduling, the day off would 
come just one week after returning 
from our winter recess, this would 
actually mean fewer students tak
ing the time to leave campus even 
with the three-day weekend since 
they would have just come back. 
It further does not address the illlogic of reopening classes later in the 
evening, nor the inequity of closing 
the University for only part of the 
day allowing some students a break 
from their classes while others still 
must attend all those they have in the 
morning. But mostly it comes down 
to the University wanting to promote 
their scheduled events.
In the schedule for this afternoons 
events, President Cohon is listed 
as giving the State of Diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon address at the 
opening of ceremonies. Diversity is 
a controversial issue on which the 
University consistently takes a blindly 
pro position. Diversity is not racial. 
Any time anyone speaks of diver
sity as requiring a broad spectrum 
of racial viewpoints, they are simply 
deluding themselves. In artificially 
arriving at their desired racially 
diverse student body and faculty, 
they' are removing or diluting any 
other aspect of diversity. This is thebasis of the amid curiae brief filed on 
behalf of the University of Michigan 
last year of which CMU was author 
and signatory.
Essentially, they classify students 
entirely based on their race by for
mally stating that two students of the 
same race cannot ipso facto be diverse 
enough from each other to constitute 
a diverse body. With everything else 
they claim to believe about Dr. Kings 
life, this claim comes as absolutely 
ridiculous.
They ask us to sacrifice half of our 
break on the bank holiday to ensure 
attendance at their programs includ
ing one dedicated to promoting their 
pet project involving exclusion based 
upon race. This is not to imply the
lack of value for all of the planned 
programs: several other presenta
tions including the keynote address 
promise to be enlightening and enter
taining. However, this being the case, 
students will want to attend without 
University interference. Many will be 
turned off to the programs by the 
Universitys policy on the day.
If the University is attempting to 
mandate adoption of their view on 
diversity by disallowing a full holi
day, they are only furthering mass
Bridget Lewis/Art Editor
disapproval of their action. In fact, 
every time they make a claim about 
diversity, one wonders whether they 
are trying to convince themselves 
or others that they are right. In any 
case, the calendar as currently pub
lished will continue to be an insult to 
the resolve of students, the memory 
of Dr. King, and conventional wis
dom.

Eyes on the sky, Bush finallyrecognizing benefits of exploration
Meseguer
For many years, our manned space pro
gram has served as a sideshow, worthy only 
of passing note in the newspapers on TV, and 
followed avidly only by a small group of faith
ful disciples. Now, President George W. Bush 
has given NASA a mandate, one that has the 
potential to once again bring the agency to the 
forefront of the minds of the American public. 
Another generation of children may have the 
chance to know the atmosphere of discovery, 
observing true milestones reached in Mans 
exploration of the Universe. They will be able 
to say, I was taking my first CSW exam when 
we landed on Mars.
For all the hope and promise this new 
announcement has injected into the NASA 
community, which comprises not only the 
government laboratories and institutions 
funded by Congress, but the previously men
tioned disciples, there are many questions that 
remain to be answered. The public will have 
a clearer view on Bushs vision for the future 
of our manned exploration of space when he 
submits his budget to Congress in the coming 
weeks, but many details have come out so far, 
including the retirement of the Space Shuttle, 
the completion of the International Space 
Station, and an extended human presence on 
the Moon in preparation for Mars and other 
destinations in the solar system.
The main question in my mind is whether 
this is just another of Bushs ploys, pulled from 
his political bag of tricks he is using so heav
ily in anticipation of Novembers Presidential 
election. There are several reasons I dont see 
this as just another campaign promise to pad 
his margin of victory. First off, NASAs chief 
administrator, Sean OKeefe, has said that he 
has been speaking with the President on the 
future of space exploration since before the 
Columbia incident, developing plans to give 
NASA the capability to fulfill the anticipated 
mandate in secret. Secondly, NASA has already 
shifted programs and planned upgrades to the 
shuttle (originally intended to extend its life
time to 2020) so that it can concentrate on 
preparing for the new missions to the Moon. 
Thirdly, Bush has proposed a plan laying out 
specific steps guiding the agency through the
next 15 years with a funding structure that 
would tread very lightly on the overall federal 
budget.
Most of the funding for the new initia
tive would come from existing programs that 
NASA would scale back or cut altogether in 
a refocusing of talent and resources into the 
main goal, a return to the Moon. The $1 bil
lion increase to NASAs budget over the next 
five years is a realistic plan that causes massive 
change to an agency that few people would 
disagree has suffered in the recent years with 
a bloated ISS budget and a malfunctioning 
shuttle. Bush even recognized that the new 
funding would be only a start and that further 
resources would have to be allocated if we are 
to finish what we have begun.
There is still a great possibility of failure for 
the entire project, and it will be up to future 
Presidents to see this grand goal truly achieved 
before we die and leave another unfulfilled 
promise to our children. The impending sense 
of doom imposed on the federal government 
by its massive budget deficit will test the wis
dom of the politicians who decide where the 
money will eventually flow. Some argue that 
we should be spending this money on other 
programs: ones to help the poor, feed the hun
gry, or aid in the war on terrorism.
The space program has always been and 
always will be an investment in the future of 
humanity. It has already paid off in the form of 
new technologies and several epiphanies that 
have rocked the scientific community. We now 
know that asteroids might one day threaten 
the planet and endanger our very existence. 
The same space program has already given us 
nascent forms of the tools we will one day need 
to defend against such a natural disaster.
We now know that it might be possible for 
life to have formed, independently or seeded, 
on worlds other than our own. Who knows, 
maybe well eventually determine that life 
on Earth came from Marss own ancient and 
now extinct life. These are the big questions, 
ones that cannot be answered by searching 
within, on our moist little ball of rock, but 
only by reaching outward toward the planets 
and the stars in our never-ending quest for 
knowledge.

MEN SHOOT PAST W&J
by Amrut Pati
Junior Stafjwriter
On January 14, the Carnegie 
Mellon mens basketball team 
clinched their third consecutivp win 
on the road at Washington and 
Jefferson University. Experience 
over a young Presidents squad and a 
strong offensive power with solid 
defensive stops proved to be key fac
tors earning the ninth Tartan victory 
of the regular season.
In a 92-71 victory over the 
Presidents, the Tartans raced out to a 
19-9 run in the first six minutes of 
the game and never gave up the lead. 
Senior forward Matt Kaitz led all 
iscorers with twenty-two points, 
shooting eight for thirteen from the 
field. Kaitz, who recorded his 1000th 
career point as a Tartan at NYU, 
exhibited all-around play by pulling 
down six rebounds and dishing eight 
assists.
A.J. Straub also stepped up in the 
Tartans commanding victory over 
the Presidents, scoring 19 points. 
Straub, who had not been as explo
sive in his past few games, was dead
ly from the field as he shot 7 of 9 
from the floor and 3 of 4 from threepoint range.
[Straub was] on fire. He was just 
feeling it and knocked everything 
down, said first-year forward Greg 
Gonzalez. Straub would hit a last 
second jumper to advance the Tartan 
lead to 41-27 just before intermis
sion.
The Presidents showed a spark of 
energy with a quick three and an 
easy two in the first 45 seconds of 
the quarter, cutting the lead down to
just nine. It was then Kaitz and the 
Tartans who answered with a quick 
eleven-point run of their own.
We were pretty nervous; the 
Washington and Jefferson ball club 
was looking a lot better in the second 
half, but our guys played a lot 
stronger and we maintained our lead 
throughout the game, said head 
coach Tony Wingen.
Junior guard Eliot Goren added 14 
points, along with sophomore for
ward Clayton Barlow-Wilcox, who 
ripped down a team-high 9 
rebounds. They forced turnovers and 
controlled rebounds leading to many 
of fast breaks to charge to a victory.
This Presidents team is one to 
take seriously, so by setting the tone 
of the game early on we were able to 
essentially demoralize them with 
our excellent game play, and in turn 
it sparked our confidence to contin
ue playing well for the rest of the 
night, said Kaitz.
Along with the offensive combi
nation of a strong back court and 
front court unit, defensive teamwork 
would prove to be just as valuable in 
shutting down the Presidents.
It was the most complete game of 
our season so far, said Wingen. The 
most critical points of a basketball 
game are the first five minutes of 
each half, and we established our 
game tempo and man-defense right 
there and dominated the entire 
game.
With conference play around the 
corner for Carnegie Mellon basket
ball, the Tartans will be well pre
pared after coming out strong in the 
first half of their season. The team 
will be visiting Hood College right 
before they travel to Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland. 
With a record of 2-1 in the confer
ence play, the Tartans will host the 
University of Chicago at Skibo Gym 
on January 30th.
This is the part of the season 
where we play the better teams in 
our schedule. If we continue to work 
hard and execute the way we have
File Photo
been all season, then we should find 
a lot of success after each game, 
explained Kaitz.
Coach Wingen's outlook for 
upcoming gameplay is just as 
promising for the remainder of the 
season. We're back in the hunt for 
the conference title this season, and 
we want it this year.
Swim teams victorious
Coach gets 100th career victory at home meet
by Colin Holloway
Staffwriter
The mens and womens Tartan 
swim teams defeated Westminster 
at home by scores of 109-79 and 
117-88, respectively. Their hard 
work ethic shown through as both 
teams won all tight relays and gave 
head coach Dave Belowich his 100th 
career victory.
It was dedication that led the 
mens team to a near perfect start 
last semester, qualifying for nation
als in several events very early in the 
season, and it was dedication that 
led to both teams sweeping their 
meets this week. On Wednesday, 
the mens and the womens teams 
swam their way to victory against 
Washington and Jefferson, setting 
up a Saturday match against 
Westminster. The victories from 
both teams showed that they are 
ready to compete in upcoming tour
naments and that Coach Belowich 
knows how to motivate his team 
well.
Im glad to have won my 100th 
victory, but I didnt swim a stroke, 
said Belowich. There have been so 
many great players come through 
since I began with the team in 1996. 
Ive worked with many tremendous 
swimmers and tremendous people 
who have supported us over the
years.
The women faced some tough 
competition and emerged victori
ous. Junior Jenn Wong who won 
both the 500 and 1000 meter 
freestyle races, led the team. The 
other swimmers followed suit, with 
senior Julie Tibor and sophomore 
Allie Theus contributing to the win
ning 400 free team, and winning 
events of their own.
The men continued to roll on 
Saturday dominating Westminster, 
Team leaders Brian McCarthy and 
Chris Pearson picked up where they 
left off last semester, as both swam 
NCAA Provisional Championship 
cut times, a feat they accomplished a 
number of times in the fall. The 
team split their relay teams up, and 
were able to win together under the 
new format.
Everyone is really getting ready 
for UAAs right now, said senior cap
tain Brian Belowich. This weekend 
set the tone for that meet.
Dual meets are a precursor to the 
Championships and UAA matches 
are a precursor to the NCAA tourna
ment. Both teams hope to carry 
their style of play through those 
meets to come, said the coach.
Next week both the mens and 
womens teams host Allegheny 
College for the final dual meet of the 
season and the last home meet for 
the seniors on either team.
Early struggles too much 
for women to overcome
by Dan Ceppos
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon women's 
basketball team's struggles contin
ued as they suffered a tough defeat 
at the hands of the Washington and 
Jefferson Presidents on Wednesday. 
Though the Tartans made a late 
comeback it wouldn't be enough as 
they fell by a score of 55-46.
The Presidents broke out to an 
early lead in the first few minutes of 
play and would never look back as 
the Tartans struggled to find their 
game. Despite taking several good 
shots at the basket, and more than 
their opponents, Carnegie Mellon 
didnt have luck on their side and 
only shot 23% from the field while 
the Presidents field goal percentage 
was 44%.
The players are struggling to 
put the ball in the hoop and they are 
giving too many unforced turnovers, 
said head coach Gerri Seidl.
They lost 26 turnovers in the game, 
12 in the first half, and were down by a 
score of 25-15 at halftime.
Much of the second half was 
spent the same way the first half was, 
with the Presidents scoring crucial 
hoops early and the Tartans trying des
perately to put together a rally. But 
before they could, they found them
selves down by as much as 21 points. It
Shared NCAA champs & NFL playoffs heat up
ymIue 2mIIm0o4
Well sports fans, I'm back again 
and Im practically oozing my pentup football banter from my eyes. I 
feel it's necessary to recap some of 
the big stories we witnessed over a 
very exciting break. I personally can't 
recall a more surprising period of 
football.
Who thought USC would give it to 
Michigan like they did? Not I. And 
who could expect Peyton Manning to 
throw eight touchdowns with no 
interceptions in the playoffs, spark
ing a two-game punt stat equaling 
the number of girls whom I have 
attracted over the last year (zero). 
The biggest shock, however came 
during the Sugar Bowl where it was 
revealed that Jessica Simpson does 
know the words to our National 
Anthem.
On that note, let's start with col
lege ball, most notably the BCS 
debacle that yielded shared cham
pions, LSU and USC. My thoughts: 
SHUT UP ABOUT THE BCS.
Before the game all I heard on TV 
was people bitching that the comput
er-run BCS system robbed' the kids 
down in USC from a shot at that cool 
shiny football awarded to the 
nations top team. As a fan, I hate 
hearing teams bitch about the sys
tem they play in. As a Decision
Science researcher, I really hate 
when their problem's solution is 
incorrect: allow humans to choose 
the champion. This is not the solu
tion. Ill spare you the explaination, 
but for God's sake, deal with the 
damn system. Just because this year 
was a SNAFU doesn't mean the BCS 
doesn't work. LSU would win in a 
head-to-head match-up anyway.
But enough about the kids. It's 
time to discuss the big boys, and man 
is there a lot to say. I'll begin with my 
greatest source of joy: the Rams. 
Mike Martz and big-game-bustBulger had a chance to lock up play
off home field advantage in their 
final game of the regular season but 
choked against the woeful Lions. 
Then a brilliant fourth quarter come
back (necessary because of three 
awful periods) was rendered moot 
by coaching buffoon Mike Martzs 
horrible decision to sit on the ball 
and play for the tie.
This was later followed by an OT 
pick thrown while in field goal 
range. Shortly after on the first play 
of the second overtime, Panthers' 
Steve Smith made a reception and 
ran into the endzone sealing a 
Carolina win. This was all followed 
by great defensive coordinator Lovie 
Smith's departure to the no-talent 
Chicago Bears. I couldn't picture a 
better finish.
Seriously though, the Rams blew
it. They were the best team in the 
NFC this year, and Martz's poor 
coaching cost them a chance to win 
again. In the last four years or so the 
Rams have been electric, held back 
only by Martz who has yet to match 
Dick Vermeils success with this 
team. St. Louis needs to dump him 
before theyre talent washes up, 
although I hope they don't.
Speaking of horrible coaching 
decisions, let's switch to the Green 
Bay Packers. One week after destroy
ing Seattle's hopes with an OT inter
ception by one of their Milli Vanilli 
corners, the Pack dropped the ball in 
a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.
Green Bay had that game, they 
dominated offensively and defen
sively, and they shouldve moved on. 
It is easy to blame this one on Farve 
for his HUGE blunder in the form of 
an intercepted pass in OT, but that 
was not the key to this loss.
The key was three fourth down 
plays: fourth and goal that featured 
Ahman Green tripping over his own 
lineman before reaching the end
zone, turning the ball over to the 
home team; fourth and one that 
Sherman didn't go for, probably 
because images of his last short 
yardage attempt flashed in his head; 
fourth and 26 that the Eagles suc
cessfully completed on the drive to 
tie the game.
All three of these plays were big;
wasnt until the final four minutes of 
the game that the women's team 
would gain momentum and find the 
basket. Racing against the clock, they 
put together a valiant 15-2 run and 
narrowed the Washington and 
Jefferson lead significantly. The late 
game heroics unfortunately proved to 
be too little too late; and the Tartans 
were on the lost a 55-46 decision.
We were having trouble putting 
the ball in the basket. It was a diffi
cult loss, said senior guard 
Danyelle Sinclair. We should have 
come back and won this game.
In spite of sophomore center 
Rebecca Shore's team-leading 14 
points, and Sinclair's and junior guard 
Lisa Seacats each having 6 rebounds 
and scoring in the double digits  12 
and 10 respectively  Carnegie 
Mellon was topped by the Presidents as 
their forward Amanda Stanonick got a 
double-double, 19 points and 10 
rebounds.
The one area that I need the 
individual players to focus more on 
is their shooting and individual 
skills, said Seidl. We're going to get 
better. There's nowhere to go but 
up.
Carnegie Mellon dropped to 
3-10 with the loss as Washington 
and Jefferson University got the win 
making their record 8-3. Today the 
Tartans will look to continue the 
strong play that ended the game
with the last one being a dramatic 
turn for the Eagles, after that it was 
clear they would win. But that play 
should never have happened. 
Sherman blew it by not going for it 
on fourth and one to seal the game. 
Ahman Green averages seven yards a 
carry that game, and you're telling 
me that he cant get one more yard? 
Ridiculous! It cost the team a chance 
at the Super Bowl. I was thrilled, I 
hate the Packers, but I do feel sorry 
for Green Bay fans: the anguish of 
watching your season end like it did 
in a game when you were rooting for 
the better team must really suck.
The AFC action was almost as sat
isfying. Steve McNair and Eddie 
George left everything they had in 
Baltimore, including their ability to 
pull out a victory, benefiting the Pats 
in the second round. The Colts rolled 
again, and looked unstoppable, but 
I'm not convinced yet. By the time 
you read this I may be, but not yet.
The Chiefs joined the ranks of 
teams who look great, but can't win 
the big game just yet. I give them two 
years before a Super Bowl if they 
keep their offense. Well, Ive run out 
of things to say. That is it and that is 
all, I'm spent.

can keep working hard as a team and 
stick to our style of play then every
thing will fall into place.
TT: Is there anything you'd like to 
add about your team or your accom
plishment?
MK: Well part of the reason I was 
able to score 1000 points was because 
of the support I received from the 
coaching staff and my teammates 
throughout my four years here. When 
I came in as a freshman they encour
aged me and gave me a chance to 
play. We've always played together as 
a team and supported one another on 
and off the court. Again, it's a nice 
personal accomplishment to have but 
there are bigger things to come.

On Sunday, January 11, the 9-4 
men's basketball team faced New 
York University at Skibo Gym. 
Though the Tartans would defeat the 
Violets by a score of 86-78, senior 
forward Matt Kaitz stole the show as 
he became the 14th player in 
Carnegie Mellon history to reach the 
1000 point plateau.
Going into the game Kaitz needed 
23 points to reach 1000. His big shot 
came in the final seconds of the 
game. With the Tartans up by 6 with 
possession of the ball and 16 seconds 
left, the Violets fouled Kaitz, sending 
him to the free throw line. Cheers 
erupted from the supportive crowd as 
the shots sank through the net, giving 
Kaitz the 23 points he needed to be 
written into Carnegie Mellon men's 
basketball history.
The Tartan interviewed Matt Kaitz 
about his achievement and this year's 
team.
The Tartan: Was there any added 
pressure on that foul shot being your 
1000th point?
Matt Kaitz: No. I concentrated 
more on what we needed as a team at 
that point and that was where my 
pressure was coming from. Before I 
took the shot one of my teammates 
stepped up and told me that this was
The Tartans season continues 
today when they go to Hood College 
in Maryland. The next home game, 
on January 30, is against the 
University of Chicago.
Club volleyball undefeated
by Mukund Sureshbabu
Junior Stafjwriter
The volleyball club, which finished 
third in the Penn-Ohio DII division 
this past winter, has started the fall 
season with an undefeated record of 
16-0-1 and has two tournament wins 
thus far. In the processes of doing so 
they've defeated nationally ranked 
Toledo University (25th) and tourna
ment hosting John Carroll University 
on their way to first place.
Carnegie Mellon was the defending 
champion of the Ohio Invitational 
held at Grove City College on 
December 6. This year's competition 
was difficult for the club as they close
ly overcome a powerful Pittsburgh 
Panthers team and Slippery Rock 
College in the playoffs to emerge 
undefeated. This success can be 
attributed to a well-rounded game 
plan focusing on a versatile attack 
and a net blocking defense.
We have 5 hitters that can consis
tently put the ball down, said eighth 
year head coach Chris Rotelli. That
makes it very difficult for opposing 
teams to stop us. Combine that with 
our size and presence at the net let's 
just say we have some pretty high 
expectations for 2004.
Michel Ressler (6'7") and Ian 
Kalinowski (6'1") play in the middle. 
Mike Shebetich (6'0") and Neema 
Moraveji (6'0") are on the outside. 
Patrick Riley (6'5") and Matt Stehlik 
are also returnng and playing strong
ly this year.
While Steve Kubinski (6'7"), Kurt 
Mininger (6'1"), as well as defensively 
strong Anthony Yoon and Lauren 
Schmidt are all rookie contributors. 
Together they are hoping to win the 
Penn-Ohio Conference and improve 
on their 9th place finish at the nation
al competition in 2003.
Practices are held at 6:30 pm 
Monday and Thursday in Skibo Gym. 
The next home match is scheduled foi 
Friday, January 23, against the 
University of Pittsburgh at 7:00 pm in 
the main gym followed by a tri-match 
on Saturday, February 14, against 
Slippery Rock and West Virginia at 
noon.

Planet 22
Combining Art and Sound
Canvas and stage performance are not usual
ly paired. However, Planet 22 weaves the two 
together competently. The band describes their 
sound as a sort of jazz fusion  a combination 
of funk, jazz, and classical elements. The band 
comprises four members, and an artist who 
travels with them occasionally was present for 
the show on Saturday at the Underground. 
Planet 22 started their concert with a highly 
energetic set that was coupled with the broad 
brushstrokes of painter Brett Hartzfield (known 
as The Vortman). The bands fast-paced 
sound and Hartzfields impromptu painting 
gave the audience no opportunity to be bored.
Hartzfields painting, created just offstage, 
evolved from a group of squares to a full color 
arrangement of shapes and figures. The fin
ished product did not seem to be a definite 
image of anything, except perhaps a building. 
The artist primarily used a dry brush to achieve 
an interesting blend of colors, but also applied 
color directly from bottle to canvas, giving parts 
of the painting more intense color. Truly, watch
ing his work and listening to the bands music in 
tandem seemed to benefit both, making the 
joint effort better than either would have been 
alone.
The band played an eclectic mix of music, 
even playing selections of Mars, a classical 
piece from Holsts Planets Suite. Each instru
ment traded the spotlight, but no one sound 
ever overpowered the rest. The bass was notice
able but well-balanced, and intermittent drum 
and guitar solos kept it interesting. Each song  
using the term loosely, since all but one piece 
had no vocals  flowed into the next piece 
almost seamlessly, with perhaps a short pause 
or an introduction by one of the band members. 
The guitar was well incorporated, but generally 
subdued, and the saxophone was featured 
prominently, since it is one element that puts 
the band above the ordinary.
Both types of artists, visual and aural, were 
fairly talented in their craft. The Underground 
is not necessarily the location you would hope 
to find something fresh as this combination 
was. The music and the visual appeal of its 
accompaniment made Planet 22 a worthwhile 
show.

that Pittsburghs cost of living was increasing more slowly than 
most areas of the country. Despite this evidence, Cyert was opti

Typos and toilet water
New Exhibits at the Miller Gallery
Two opposite sides of the artistic community came 
together this week at the Regina Gouger Miller Art 
Gallery. Matthew Carters Typographically Speaking 
showcases his 40-year career in designing typefaces. 
Adam Frelin is also exhibiting his art. Window 
Replacements, Park Proposals, and Water 
Rerouting Initiatives are some of his unconventional 
works displayed at the gallery.
Matthew Carters display, including twenty-seven 
type panels from his personal archive, shows how his 
work has changed over the course of his career.
He used to actually draw it, make the calculations 
and do it on vellum. Now, its all done on software. Its 
still the same sensibility, but the process to get there is 
different, said gallery director Jenny Strayer.
Typography, or the science of using type design, as 
Strayer defines it, is often overlooked as an art form. 
Many people read a text without considering the font 
choice. Carter has designed over seventy typefaces. 
Some are well-known, such as Bell Centennial, 
Galliard, and Mantinia. Others such as Cascade Script, 
Pegasus Bold, and Alisal have less of a reputation. 
Anyone can use his digital styles Verdana and Tahoma 
when typing using Microsoft Word.
Carter has designed very specific typefaces, such as 
the one designed especially for the promotional mate
rials of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. He also designed the National Geographic 
caption to solve the magazines problem that regular
Roman italics were too hard to read. Many people read 
the captions instead of the article, so he designed a 
typeface that had less tilt but was still recognized as 
italic. He also designed different versions of Miller 
when the Boston Globe reformatted in 2000.
The Miller Gallery displayed his work using handcut punches and screen fonts along with banners 
exemplifying all of his styles. The different processes 
used in the field over its history were explained along
side Carters work. For example, photocomposition 
revolutionized the field in 1936 by making a way to set 
type by exposing film negatives of type characters onto 
photosensitive film or paper.
Carters work is well-known, especially in the design 
community. This exhibit, co-sponsored by the Miller 
Gallery and the American Institute of Graphic Arts 
(AIGA), should appeal to the design community.
Its a chance to reach out to the design community. 
Carters name will draw in designers. We hope it will 
bring in those who have never heard of Miller Gallery 
or have never visited before, said Strayer.
Frelins work should draw in a very different set of 
art admirers. He describes his work as maintaining the 
same sensibility as graffiti art: You make something 
your own, not necessarily with permission.
His Window Replacements includes pictures of his 
vinyl covers inspired by contemporary artists such as 
Gary Hume and Ross Alexander. The idea came from
the high crime rate in St. Louis where he lives. Many 
people were driving around with plastic bags over bro
ken windows smashed out. These replacements add a 
bit of color instead.
Frelin played a short fifteen-minute video of his 
Water Rerouting Initiatives. He filmed ten to twelve 
different projects where he had rerouted the water of 
public places such as public restrooms and sprinkler 
systems. In one example, the film showed a sink in a 
restroom taped to redirect the water out of the sink 
and into the toilet. In another project he took a fivegallon bucket of water from a bay and returned it to 
Lake Mead, formed by the Hoover Dam. The exhibit 
was a statement about unconventional, almost per
formance, art carried out in the same style as graffiti 
art. Frelin rigged up contraptions made of tape, PVC 
piping, or five-gallon buckets to redirect the water of 
public places without permission. Then he filmed the 
outcome as a permanent keepsake of his temporary 
art. His third display is his Park Proposals. It includes 
plans for three unconventional public parks. One is a 
park continually landscaped to grow and shrink each 
day. The idea is that it never looks the same day after 
day. Another included models of small-scale moun
tains designed to be placed in the middle of major 
cities. The models of real mountains in Peru, China, 
and the Philippines were placed in photographs of 
Dallas, Atlanta, and Chicago.
It takes the best out of other places in the same way 
Disney has Epcot, said Frelin.
The third proposal was influenced by a Japanese 
rock garden. Instead of large rocks in the garden, there 
were vacant holes. Much of Frelins work is inspired by 
Japan; he received a research grant to go there for six 
months.
Japanese garden design is always interesting. It 
thinks about all of the landscape of the area and 
includes it in the actual garden, said Frelin
Frelin designs his sculptures to exist as both models 
and art objects. Even if his proposals are implemented, 
he does not intend for them to be permanent.
Everything is temporary. I dont think theres a 
need for things to stay forever. They get stale, Frelin 
commented.
Carters and Frelins works are on display at the 
Miller Gallery until March 17. Frelin gave a lecture on 
January 15, and Carter is* scheduled to lecture on 
January 25. His lecture will be at 3:30 pm in the 
Kresge Hall in the College of Fine Arts.

Adam Frelin speaks:
Graffiti as art, sensual mirrors, and the energy of flowing water
Last Thursday, artist Adam Frelin spoke at 
McConomy Auditorium, starting off this springs series 
of lectures featuring various artists. Frelin received 
his undergraduate education in sculpture and per
formance at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and 
completed his Master of Fine Arts degree in sculp
ture at the University of California, San Diego, with 
the San Diego Fellowship. In the spring, he will use 
a research grant to travel to Kyoto to study garden 
design. Frelins exhibition opened on Friday, January 
16, at the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery.
In the forms of photography and video, the audi
ence could witness Frelins own distinct philosophy 
come to life through various examples of his art. 
Overall, Frelins art is largely reliant on images and 
experiences that he comes across, and, like many art
ists, Frelin sees the world around him in a symbolic 
manner. His art making process is based on recreating 
observed experiences.
Im attracted to things that seem to have a life of 
their own, Frelin explained. This life force, or energy, 
causes an intuitive response in him and is often pres
ent in his own work.
Frelin began his presentation by showing photo
graphs of real-life situations that would pave the way 
to explaining his own artistic experience. From metal
plates that cover up holes between stalls in public 
bathrooms to stop men from having sex with each 
other, to mirrors in the Tokyo metro that are meant 
to prevent people from jumping onto the tracks, an 
attempted control of an invisible energy was a major 
theme in these photographs.
If all goes well, youre in harmony with [the 
energy] and there is no struggle, said Frelin. If its 
denied, then that struggle becomes apparent, and 
will find a way to push itself to the surface. These 
are the kinds of things that I seek out in my work and 
where I draw my inspiration from. Ironically, the 
metal plates in bathrooms make the forbidden sexual 
activities even more apparent, and the mirrors in the 
subway stations cause peoples suicidal desires to 
become visible. Thus, the attempts to suppress energy 
have, ironically, brought the energy to the surface. 
Water is a recurring way in which Frelin illustrates 
the escape of energy. In leaking fire hydrants or pipes, 
the energy, in the form of water, is literally escaping 
through a breaking point. In a series of works titled 
the Water Rerouting Initiatives, Frelin found ways 
to redirect waters natural flow by connecting sinks, 
toilets, and water fountains with duct tape in public 
bathrooms. In these pieces, his process of cutting 
and pasting, his isolating of observed events and 
recreating them in a more refined manner, became 
apparent. Because of his background as a graffiti artJ.T. Trollman/Assistant Photo Editor
Adam Frelin lecturing in McConomy last Thursday.
ist, Frelin naturally finds himself using public places 
as stages for his art.
Frelin is a versatile artist who fluently uses various 
materials, including paper, metal, mirrors, water, 
and light, to create symbolic representations of dif
ferent phenomena that he comes across. He allows 
the energy of the pieces to speak for themselves, as 
this energy, like flowing or dripping water, has the 
capability to break the silence even when no one is 
watching.
I want your mind to create visual moments that 
temporarily suspend verbal reactions, Frelin said. 
Fittingly, the most powerful part of Frelins lecture 
was the art itself, that even through photographs, 
made an effective impression on its own.

Welcome to the
Pink Floyds The Wall  and then some
Pink Floyds The Wall is a bloated and overwrought 
double album, stuffed with filler and late-seventies 
concept-rock excess. But it sure does rock to hear it 
played live in its entirety. The Machine, Americas pre
miere Pink Floyd tribute band, performed at Club 
Laga on Saturday, January 17th, partying like it was 
1979 with all 26 songs from The Wall and then some. 
The Machine provided no shortage of ambience with 
lights, fog machines, and projectors showing the film 
version of The Wall as the band played.
Frontman Joe Pascarell had his Roger Waters 
impression honed to perfection, which is a doubleedged sword; at best he sounded strong, emotive, and 
dynamic, and at worst he yelped like Trey Anastasio 
might if you stuck him with a pin.
Regardless, he recreated each vocal idiosyncrasy 
with stunning accuracy, right down to the occasional 
bizarre pronunciation (But it was only fan-tahzee?), making for a very authentic experience. His 
channeling of David Gilmour was just as complete. 
Pascarell moved with a virtuosic fluidity as he mas
saged Gilmours trademark soaring guitar tone from
Machine
his modified strat. All of his solos were note-for-note 
where they needed to be, and when they didnt they 
were on par with or better than anything Floyd ever 
recorded. Comfortably Numb was a highlight of the 
evening, featuring an amazing display of synergy and 
musicianship.
The bands use of dynamics was expert; everyone 
assumed they had already hit their maximum level, 
when in reality the band was merely waiting for just 
the right moment to turn their amps to 11. And when 
they finally did, well, if guitar solos could kill, there 
would have been no survivors from this performance. 
Pascarell had all the pedals and fancy gear to obtain 
the necessary palette of guitar tones (including a very 
convincing acoustic simulator), but he walks a fine 
line between sounding authentic and over-processed. 
There were a few moments when it seemed like turn
ing the effects down a few notches wouldve cleared 
things up.
After The Wall concluded, the band indulged the 
screaming audience with several more songs from 
other albums, which was a welcome treat, though it
Uneducated Guess
Ani DiFrancos new solo album turns a sweet sound sour
Ani DiFranco stuffed some of the CD jackets for her 
latest release, Educated Guess, by herself  she also 
sang, played her guitar, recorded, and did the mixing 
on this, her most solo album since her second in 
1991. In the studio for Guess, DiFranco relied on no 
one, not even the recording engineers who usually 
set up her microphones.
It was like an exorcism of sorts  a very lonely, 
very frustrating excruciating process, but also really 
empowering and really instructive, she told Rolling 
Stone's Brian Orloff in October. Here is a woman who 
likes to work alone.
DiFrancos is arguably the most independent career 
in popular music. Always relying on word-of-mouth 
fame, she has spent the last 13 years in the drivers 
seat of her own label, Righteous Babe Records, mak
ing musical choices all over the map. DiFranco does 
things like inventing her own guitar tunings, one of 
which she calls Herb. She has recorded duets with 
everyone from folk godfather Utah Philips to action 
man Jackie Chan. Her political wit shows up in main
stream highbrow media  salon.com and National 
Public Radios All Things Considered  and her 
subversive poetry sells well sprinkled craftily 
between tracks on her albums. I love my country/by 
which I mean/1 am indebted joyfully/ to all the peo
ple throughout its history/who have fought the gov
ernment to make it right, she intones smugly on 
Guess's tenth track, a poem named Grand Canyon.
But like many artists who pride themselves on 
being contrarians, DiFranco sounds better with oth
ers around to mitigate her bitterness. Instead of the 
fire of her previous work, Guess has a soul of ice. Its 
lanky guitar strains and sour tunes are too strungtogether, too chilled-out. Her lyrics are terse and 
sparse, like a balding cynic, like someone too busy or 
angry to talk. The melodies are leaden, a far cry from 
the thrumming pulse of 1991s Like I Said or the 
florid mariachi trumpets of the title track on Little 
Plastic Castle in 1998.
Her lyrics and poems have become a wallowing 
paean to urban sprawl and defeat; the neighbors TV 
flickers at night, hawks circle in the sky above a strip 
mall, and sleep is like being smashed against the 
mattress/ legs and arms akimbo/ like the highpitched body of a jumper waiting for her chalk out
line. DiFranco wails that she is a never ending 
vending machine whose heart now lives in a shack 
outside of town.
When the theme of feminism surfaces, DiFranco 
reverts to whining. I am an all-powerful Amazon
served to further highlight the shortcomings of The 
Wall. Wish You Were Here was transcendent; even 
though it was sans slide guitar, it featured an added 
verse sung by the audience and was quite a moving 
experience. Money came complete with cash 
machine sound effects and a tasty keyboard solo by 
Neil Alexander in lieu of the saxophone.
The extended jam featured a Bob Marley impres
sion and a somewhat unfortunate descent into noodle-dom, but all was forgiven when they kicked it back 
into high gear. The band ended with the quintessential 
closer, a stirring rendition of Brain Damage into 
Eclipse.
The Machine doesnt need any stinkin backup 
singers; their power as four-piece rendered anything 
else superfluous. Anyone looking for an evening of fun 
and Floyd is advised to keep an eye on this band. 
Welcome, my son. Welcome to The Machine.
5lwCwe RmIsTw,a9 
rpeum, 5loii0,ulw,
warrior/not just some sniveling girl, she croons, yet 
then warns that she is tired of being your savior, 
and tired of telling you why. DiFranco has been pro
ducing gripping, passionate albums of deliberately 
happy music for more than a decade, but suddenly 
she is tired of everything.
Other far-left femmes can get away with feeling 
overwhelmed, but DiFranco has always been an ide
alist in the folk tradition, with plenty of that genreis 
most important musical ingredient  hope  and 
that is what these tracks lack. They dont sound like 
her, the ebullient patron saint of a generation of soft
core feminist punks and Do-It-Yourselfers.
Oh great stroke of bare emotional night and unbe
lievable suck, she has scribbled in Guess's CD jacket, 
and instead of seeming sexy, it invites an ironic 
chuckle. After clawing her way to the top, this bare 
sound could kill the grassroots appeal that DiFranco 
has worked so hard for  so much for educated 
guesses.

Brave new store
A small music retailer grows
Music fans addicted to CDs and vinyl records stand 
discussing the latest release of the Pittsburgh-based 
band Tabula Rasa.
Many people in attendance are already in bands of 
their own. From the bands performing in-store 
appearances to those in attendance the do-it-yourself 
attitude that emerged in the American punk scenes of 
the early 1980s stays strong. Tabula Rasa is happy to 
have another venue to perform in, and they wait as 
more people fill the store  slowly, the addicted 
music connoisseurs cram in groups of twos, threes, or 
fours.

shops to pick up CDs and vinyl by up-and-coming rock 
and hip-hop artists.
This is a perfect scenario considering that trips to 
the mall often garner mixed results. For one, the mall 
in the suburbs hasnt received the new CD yet, and 
worse, they havent even heard of the group who cre
ated such magic. Behind the counter of Brave New 
World, Spahr Schmitt, Rob Tabachka, Eric Good, and 
Eli Kasan make an effort to keep up with the newest 
sounds championed in underground circles.
In an age where downloading entire albums is 
always an option, stores like BNW have a lot with 
which to compete. They must cater to their customers, 
always trying to get the newest releases before any
body else does. This isnt a problem for them because 
the store employees, like their customers, are passion
ate fans.
Before Eli Kasan, a junior at Robert Morris 
University, ended up behind the counter ringing up 
the register, he was on the other side, buying records 
as early as seventh grade. He told how he would hitch 
a ride part of the way with his mom and then trek fur
ther to the Birmingham Bridge in search of records.
My mom used to own a restaurant in the South 
Side and she would come down at six in the morning. 
Shed drop me at six in the morning and I had my 
skateboard, Id either take the bus or skate over to 
Oakland.
On the weekends, Kasan would skate all the way to 
Brave New World and hang around till they opened.
There were always people hanging around [when I 
would be there] on the weekends in the summer.
Kasan, who worked in various jobs including con
struction with his father, now has a job that is the envy 
of his peers. What could be better than playing your 
favorite music and getting paid for it? And how did he 
get the job in the first place?
I think I asked once, said Kasan. They werent 
hiring and years later, Spahr asked me what I was 
doing for the summer.
Kasan was interrupted by customers picking up a 
CD or two. Tabachka and Schmitt mentioned that an 
out-of-town band, the Starcrossed, called to say theyd 
be late. With a smile on his face, Schmitt said, Well, 
theyre not coming. He looked at the magnetic white
board behind him. As the band listing went, only 
Tabula Rasa, the headliner, looked like theyd be per
forming that night.
Outside BNW, it was incredibly cold, but the few 
people walking outside are warm  not because of 
their jackets, but because of the idea theyll soon be in 
heated quarters. Members of local college radio sta
tions greeted each other when not busy looking at the 
stacks. Others stood behind the stage that the guys at 
BNW built with their own hands.
That came out of the D.I.Y. that we got from the 
music, said Tabachka. They did the carpeting, the 
painting, the stage, all part of the do-it-yourself spirit 
that came out of their early influences of underground 
music.
The Starcrossed arrived wearing the sweaters and 
tight pants typical of independent rock today. 
Surprisingly  perhaps unsurprisingly  the band 
from Kent, Ohio got lost in the cross-eyed streets of 
Pittsburgh proper. They roared into their first few 
songs. Preceding their last song, lead singer Zach 
Bussinger asked the still audience to near the stage by 
telling their brutal story of their trip to the Iron City.
We drove in a van for three hours with no heat; it 
would help us out if you made it warm, he said. A few 
sing the sing-along chorus he asks them to donate.
Last on stage is Tabula Rasa. Many in the audience 
familiar with the band ask for songs when the band 
offers them the option at the end of their set. Tabula 
Rasa has a special connection to CMU, as two of their 
members  Andrew Grossmann and Rob Spagaire  
graduated from CMU as communication design 
majors from the class of 2003. After the set, bass play
er Justin Campbell took a few minutes to speak of how 
he became a musician.
I started playing bass. My stepbrother played gui
tar and the first band I was in was with him. He said, 
Yeah, I want to start a band, you should play bass. And 
I said, Okay. Ill buy a bass. 
This all happened while he was in junior high, 
though first he had to buy some equipment that was 
not always of the best quality.
I bought a Peavy TKO with a 15 [watt] combo 
[amplifier] that sounded [bad]. The Peavy bass

weighed so much and sounded like crap and the amp 
sounded like someone poked holes in the speaker.
Campbells learning style was one of personal teach
ing and experimentation, though he did take lessons 
for a short time.
I kinda messed around at first, I was really bad. At 
first I took lessons for two weeks, [but] I didnt want to 
learn how to read music and follow along with music,
I wanted to learn scales  crazy [stuff].
Les Claypool, the bass player for Primus famed for 
his aggressive and funky slapping style, and Flea, 
the bass player for Red Hot Chili Peppers, are musical 
inspirations for Campbell, who wanted to do his own 
thing and not just follow written music.
He recommends that beginners jump, into music 
head first. He also recommends that those who may 
not be wild about paying for lessons consider getting a 
few instruction videos. That way, he argued, one can 
take it at ones own pace, rewinding and fast-forward
ing without the pressure of spending ones own money 
on lessons.
Tabula Rasa is one of A-F Records more recent addi
tions. The group is happy that the label gave them the 
chance to record with famed producer J. Robbins, 
who once played in legendary D.C. band Jawbox and 
more recently Burning Airlines.
Tabula Rasa asked people to donate a dollar or 
two to the store for being one more venue for local 
and touring bands to perform.
Though many record stores will occasionally have 
in-store performances, once in a blue moon, BNW 
has weekly rock and hip-hop concerts planned and 
lined up. Friday nights, rock bands will take the 
stage; Saturday nights, hip-hop groups will do the 
same. Inside the steamed-up BNW, everybody is 
happy, except perhaps a few CMU students who now 
must walk a few extra blocks to Semple and Bates 
instead of walking to nearby Craig Street. Odds are 
that if they are like Kasan, that wont be much of a 
problem.

Big Als Metal Shop
Judas Priest Strikes Back
Judas Priest 
Electric Eye (DVD)
Sony Music (Video)
When it comes to musicianship, it is fair to say that of all of metals godfathers, 
Judas Priest has probably had the most far-reaching influence on todays heavy hit
ters. From Pantera to Slayer to Metallica to Megadeth, all have borrowed a bit of 
their sound from Priest. But, in my humble opinion, Priests true genius lies in its 
pioneering fashion sense. I mean come on, who else would have thought of having 
a lead singer in leather S&M-wear riding a Harley on stage?
Lets face it, as far as fashion goes, the 80s werent kind to many rockers (just 
look at what KISS has on in the Lick It Up video if you need proof). Looking back 
at all the scowling faces under the poofy yet ever so lovingly manicured hair, you 
have to wonder ... why? Well, Priest couldt have cared less why, and the band 
dressed with such panache that even our beer-chugging, Camaro-driving older 
brothers loved it. Really, what Priest did was bring gay camp and sensibility to a 
straight audience, way before the metrosexuals got to us. Looking back now, titles 
like British Steel, Point of Entry, and Ram It Down, to name a few, take on an 
entirely new meaning. It was metals worst kept secret that Rob Halford batted for 
the other team, and you know what, no music fan cared then, and nobody does 
now. Still1, it must have been a secret thrill for Rob to stare down at the 
Neanderthals in the front row as they cheered him on.
And what better visual record of Priests accomplishments than their videos? 
Remember the time when Rob rescued the rest of the band from a throng of sexhungry vixens? Even later videos like Painkiller brings us a view of fashion 
trends to come, as Rob was one of the first metal frontmen to let his hair recede 
gracefully, and eventually shave his head (a few years before Phil Anselmo of 
Pantera made it seem bad-ass to the rest of us). Again, musically, Priest stands as 
tall as Black Sabbath and maybe even Zeppelin. However, this was and is a visual 
band. Live concert videos, like the commercially released Priest...Live, are a tes
tament not only to one of the forefathers of elaborate staging, but also to Priests 
fans. While the underground cult-classic Heavy Metal Parking Lot shows us front 
and centre who these people were, Priest...Live shows them in action, high-fiving 
at each step Halford takes and every dramatic microphone pull he makes. In a 
word, awesome. Until now, you could only get this live video on VHS, and even that 
was getting sketchy. Happily, this concert is now available on DVD as Electric Eye, 
along with a collection of their promo videos. For good measure, the powers that 
be have even thrown in some rare footage of Priest in the early 70s when they were 
pop stars in England, making appearances on TV shows like Top of the Pops 
and The Old Grey Whistle Test. Whats not to like?

Deus Next
Choice reigns supreme in this high-profile sequel
Sequels are notorious for being short of expecta
tions. No matter what the medium, especially when 
their progenitors are critically acclaimed. The Matrix 
sequels disappointed thousands of fans because, in 
their eyes, they couldnt live up to the original. Many 
of Tom Clancys latest novels have met lukewarm 
receptions from reviewers and readers because they 
simply lack the magic of the first Jack Ryan books. 
And Deiis Ex: Invisible War is seeing a mixed reaction 
from gamers everywhere because many see it as an 
abomination to the name of its near-legendary prede
cessor.
The original Deus Ex came out in June 2000. The 
games unique blend of first-person shooter (FPS) and 
role-playing game (RPG) elements led it to a cult fol
lowing and almost universal praise. Its story of a UN 
anti-terrorist agent named J.C. Denton and a twisting 
web of conspiracy, intrigue, and betrayal drew in 
many gamers; numerous publications awarded it the 
coveted Game of the Year award, which just cemented 
its place in the gaming pantheon as an instant classic.
Published by Ion Storm Entertainment, a studio led 
by designer Warren Spector, Deus Ex: Invisible War 
takes place in the late 21st century, approximately 
twenty years after the events of the first game. After a 
worldwide depression, there are two main factions 
vying for the hearts and minds of the planets popula
tion: the World Trade Organization (WTO), which 
offers security based on financial prosperity, and the 
Order, a religious organization that preaches harmo
ny with nature and with the self.
The main character in Deus Ex: Invisible War is Alex 
D. (pictured on the cover of the game), a trainee in the 
Tarsus program, which takes children under its wings 
and raises them to be covert operative agents. The 
game lets you choose to play Alex as a male or female, 
and it actually has a slight effect on what happens in 
the game (subtle dialogue changes, for instance). 
Alex is supported by a huge array of other characters, 
including peers, rivals, and so many faction leaders
your head will spin. Some names may be familiar to 
fans of the original game, but it is not hard to get an 
idea of what is going on if you have never played the 
first Deus Ex.
Deus Ex: Invisible War is all about choice. The unof
ficial motto of the game is Sneak, Hack, Bribe, Kill. 
You are offered many solutions to each problem you 
encounter  if you so choose, you can probably play 
the game the entire way through without killing any
one. The importance of these choices is amplified 
because you are given assignments from different fac
tions, and often these assignments directly conflict 
with each other (for instance, there is one situation 
where you are ordered to kill a man by one group, and 
to rescue him by another), so you have to choose to 
whom you want to pledge your allegiance.
The game mechanics make these choices even deep
er. More than half of the nearly two dozen weapons at 
your disposal can be modified to suit your needs  
you can silence them, change the type of ammunition 
they use, and modify their statistics in many other 
ways. In addition to this increasingly mind-boggling 
array of choices, the player has the choice of 15 dif
ferent biomods (short for biomodifications) which 
use nanotechnology infusions to create extra abilities. 
Some biomods include a neural hacking interface, 
night vision, increased strength, silent footsteps, 
cloaking, and wound healing. The player can pick a 
suite of biomods that best fits their playing style. 
Needless to say, it is very easy to play the 
game through two or three times with 
completely different experiences.
In terms of system requirements, 
the game is a hardware hog. 
Framerates are low even at fairly 
modest resolutions, and many of the 
lighting effects have to be turned off 
or turned down to achieve acceptable 
performance on all but the most powerful sys 
tems. Model and texture detail is impressive,
and the lighting system is capable of drawing dynam
ic shadows for everything. Invisible War is part of the 
first generation of DirectX 9 games, which means that 
poor performance will be common in these games 
until more mature hardware reaches the mass market.
The sheer amount going on in each level you reach 
is amazing. You can talk to any character you see 
walking the streets  some will even give you small 
missions to complete. One such side mission involves 
your continued participation in a rivalry .between two 
coffee shops: one owner offers to pay you a handsome 
sum if you bomb his competitor and destroy his supply 
of coffee beans. Ion Storm managed to really cram a 
living world onto two CD-ROMs. The story is com
pelling enough to keep you playing, and the gameplay 
is as varied as you make it. The action never really 
slows down; however, the game is over fairly quickly, 
after only 12-15 hours of play. That only accounts for 
one play-through; there is still much more to experi
ence after the first time, though, so there is incentive 
to come back. The game itself has five different end
ings, depending on which faction you choose to sup
port.
Fans of the original Deus Ex may be 
under-whelmed; many have 
described Invisible War as uDeus Ex 
When compared to the original, 
Deus Ex: Invisible War seems to fall 
short; however, taken on its own, it is 
really a great game, and one that deserves 
to be enjoyed. It is published by Eidos and 
available for both PC and Xbox plat
forms.

Psych tykes
The link between the psychology program and the Childrens School benefits both
FomSyi

Kristina Izumi, left, a second-year psychology major, talks to students at the CMU Childrens School, located in Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall
On the ground level of Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Hall, the classrooms look a little different from the 
rest of campus. The colors are brighter, and the chairs 
are tiny  but the students arent all children. At the 
Childrens School, college students learn and play 
alongside pre-school and kindergarten-age children 
while studying their learning and development skills.
The Childrens School was founded in 1968 and has 
since developed into a tool for both the teachers and 
children. Constant learning is an apparent theme at 
the Childrens School. Pre-schoolers and kinder
garteners are learning age-appropriate basics while
they play, but through ongoing developmental 
research, their teachers and various other undergrad
uate and graduate students are learning at the same 
time.
The Childrens School is different from any other 
pre-school or kindergarten because it acts as a labora
tory for students at Carnegie Mellon to observe and 
experiment with various topics like cognitive learning 
and social interaction. The school also allows college 
students to interact with young children, and helps 
those students who want to pursue careers in educa
tion.
The biggest benefit of participating in a program 
that is focused on learning in so many different ways 
is that the teachers and facilities are top-notch, cutting 
edge, basically high quality, said Sharon Carver, the 
director of the Childrens School. They enjoy partici
pating in the studies. It is fun for them, but thats not 
a major impact on the curriculum. The bigger impact 
there is that the undergrads who actually participate 
in the classroom add activities based on their interests 
and skills that might not otherwise be included  a 
basic breadth advantage.

---------------------------------------------------

Dr. Carver, who teaches all ages of students, is 
beginning her eleventh year as the director of the 
Childrens School. Since coming to the Childrens 
School, Carver has worked with staff and parents to 
strengthen the schools programs, improve the facili
ties, and build strong connections with the university.
The children come from a wide variety of back
grounds, said Carver. About 15 percent are [chil
dren of CMU faculty and staff], but all have parents 
who are very committed to quality education. They 
obviously know they are being observed because 
there are frequently extra adults in the room taking 
notes, audiotaping them, etc. We talk to them about 
the fact that grown ups can still go to school to learn 
more and that part of their class work is learning 
about children, so they learn by watching or playing 
special games with the children.
Undergraduate interaction with the Childrens 
School can take many forms, beginning with actual 
classes that CMU students can take at the school. The 
undergraduate program involves three different dis
tinct areas: research, theory, and practicum.
The theory portion of the undergraduate program 
is developed partially in each of the three different 
courses that are available to most students. Typically, 
a students first encounter with the Childrens School 
will be through Principles of Child Development. 
Compared to most other basic child development 
courses, taught through books and lecture, the child 
development course at the school is more interactive 
by allowing students to observe children and their 
natural behaviors. The class visits the school four dif
ferent times. The first two times are spent observing 
and investigating the development of physical motor 
skills, such as hand-eye coordination. The undergrad
uates then compare the development of pre-school 
students to that of kindergartners. The second two 
times that the students visit the school, they are 
encouraged to narrow their observations and investi
gation to a specific topic such as gender and social 
interactions. One of the most common hypotheses 
drawn from these observations is that children do not 
begin to segregate themselves until they reach the 
kindergarten age; younger children do not pay atten
tion to gender or physical differences.
The next class that is available for undergraduates 
to take is Research Methods in _ Developmental 
Psychology. This course allows students to conduct 
two different studies at the school working with the 
children who attend there. The second project that 
the students do allows them to design their own 
research project and conduct the project on kids at the 
Childrens School. The undergraduates then must 
present their research to other peers and faculty 
members, making the project complete.
Having the Childrens School on campus allows stu
dents in the Carnegie Mellon community to experi
ence something new and unique when conducting 
research. In most other college students would get to 
design a lab, but not actually conduct it. By the time 
CMU students involved with the Childrens School
leave college, they already possess experience in 
research, which is unavailable from many other psy
chology departments in other colleges.
Practicum in Child Development is another course 
that allows students to critique the theory that they 
learned by comparing the theory to actual observa
tions within the classroom. Each week in a seminar 
students discuss a different theory and then they are 
encouraged to observe the theory in the childrens 
class. The undergraduates work extensively with the 
children, showcased by a final case study on one par
ticular child. This project examines all aspects of the 
childs development and different ways to foster the 
childs growth.
There are also other ways that undergraduate stu
dents on campus can become involved with the 
Childrens School. There are on-campus jobs available 
through the Childrens School where students can 
work in the office of the school or in the classroom. 
People who are interested in volunteer service often 
do projects that involve the school or students. 
Students can also become involved in the school inde
pendently through specific research projects that may 
need to be conducted for other classes. Older students 
may use the school as part of a lab or their honors the
sis. All of these possibilities make the school a very 
useful resource for the Carnegie Mellon campus.
Some students on campus benefit from the chil
drens presence on campus in other ways. Drama stu
dents may need childrens toys as props, or even need 
children to participate in their plays. Students from 
the Childrens School were used to test chairs and new 
art tools for Design and art projects. The children are 
sometimes photographed for' various art projects. 
These projects present a special opportunity for young 
children and college students to learn simultaneously.
Daisy Powell, a post-doctoral fellow, is conducting 
research with Dr. David Plaut, a former Childrens 
School parent. They are studying what basic skills a 
child must possess to learn how to read. Two specific 
factors play a part in developing these skills. The chil
dren must learn to connect the sound that is repre
sented by the letter to the name of the letter, but they 
must also learn the minute differences between the 
written letters. The two researchers are trying to look 
at these abilities separately, then see how the skills are 
connected to each other. There are a few tasks and 
sessions involved in this research. One task that is pre
sented to the children includes studying the childs 
ability to distinguish between letters and non-letters 
through the use of a computer program. The second 
idea that is being tested is that of phonological skills. 
The children are shown pictures of common objects 
and asked to say just the first or last letter. These dif
ferent experiments are related to the way that chil
dren will learn to name, write, or say the different 
names of the letters.
These shared experiences at the Childrens School 
can shape the attitudes and futures of both the pre
school and the college students.
As an undergraduate student in psychology, [I 
found] the Childrens School... an excellent resource 
for research and discovery, said Haley Vlach, a soph
omore business administration and psychology major. 
Last semester I conducted a research study that ana
lyzed the effects of different experiences on childrens 
drawings. While conducting the study, I benefitted 
greatly by gaining insight into research processes and 
working with children.
Classes with the childrens school also serve stu
dents who are not psychology majors. Students from 
all different colleges and disciplines at CMU may 
decide to take the Child Development course simply 
because they enjoy being around children.
My first  and current  impression is that the 
Childrens School is the happiest place in the world, 
said Daniel Haeg, a fourth-year mechanical engineer
ing major. The youngest child of five, Haeg had no 
experience with kids before he began working at the 
school.
The first day of work, I did my best to play with all 
the kids, but I didnt feel like I had much of an effect, 
he said. They dont always let you know. But the sec
ond day, as the parents were picking their children up, 
one parent said, Oh, you must be the boy my daugh
ter was talking about all day! I [had] spent no more 
than 10 minutes with her reading a book, and I really 
hadnt thought much of it, but apparently she had.
Since then, Haeg has been hooked.
Every day since, the kids have found a way to sur
prise me, he said. They are so much more curious, 
imaginative, and genuine than adults. You cant help 
but be envious.
But the children have a strong desire to develop 
concrete rules about the world, said Haeg. They get 
frustrated when there are inconsistencies. When chil
dren or adults are faced with a rule, they want to 
know why? Because I said so is not an adequate 
answer, and it does not encourage other questions.
In the Childrens School, as much as possible, we 
let the children know exactly why a rule is in place, 
said Haeg. This is as much a matter of respect as com
mon sense; they are less likely to break a rule if they 
understand that it is for their own benefit. We dont 
say kids in the Childrens School, we say friends. 
Everybody, including teachers, is a friend.

The lion roars  along with the audience
Director Julie Taymor helps bring a masterpiece to the Benedum
The Lion King musical seems good at first only 
because of the extreme measures taken to produce it. 
The stage is given multiple levels in some scenes; in 
others it boasts two rotating staircases and smoke 
cannons. Beneath the technically impressive features 
that made the play such an eye-opening experience 
were the songs, the graceful dancers bending in per
fect unison, and the rhythm of the bongos. The sim
pler, more basic elements of the play were as master
fully done as the more amazing feats of costuming 
and design. So much occurred during many scenes 
that it was a struggle to take in everything there; the 
sounds blending with the sights seemed to overtake 
everything in the theater, even the light bouncing 
from the out-of-place chandeliers. For those who have 
not been to a play recently, or who have never gone, 
they will find The Lion King a delightful performance 
full of excitement, done on an unusually grand scale.

It seemed hard to imagine the setting of the African 
plains working well with the crystal chandeliers in the 
Benedum Center, especially considering the bitterly 
cold weather. Then, the lights dimmed, silence 
reigned (even for row upon row of small children) 
and the spectacle began. A fully stocked zoo of char
acters marched to the front, complete with an enor
mous elephant. Joyful, exuberant singers began to 
chant together, led by Rafiki, played by South African 
Futhi Mhlongo. Wildly impressive costuming coupled 
with the spirited voices of the full ensemble set the 
tone for the great performance that was to come.
The opening number of The Lion King musical 
comes complete with butterfly kites and a menagerie, 
the greater portion of which makes an impressive 
march from the aisle to the stage. The costuming is 
not only astoundingly intricate and well-done, but it is 
also as convincing as one could possibly expect. The 
giraffes, for instance, cannot even immediately be dis
tinguished as having human occupants. Not only that, 
however; the cast was extremely talented: the huge 
costumes seemed not to encumber voice or move
ment. The first scene at Pride Rock allows more of the 
African chanting sound to enter the music than could 
be found in the cartoon version of the tale. This con
tinues throughout the play, with several added scenes 
and songs containing African chants written by Lebo 
M and Tsidii Le Loka. The added scenes and songs 
seemed to help make the flavor of the play more 
mature, and it acknowledged the setting as nothing 
the cartoon version had ever truly done. The Lion King 
had a respectable number of added parts, but the 
plays dialogue was nearly identical to the film in 
many cases, which was disappointing. The cast, how
ever, seemed equally adept at delivering the many 
spoken lines as they were at singing. Rafikis unique 
African sound was a little difficult to get used to  it 
was a bit harsh  but by the second act it seemed to 
fit well with the songs and blend better than it had in
the opening number. Young Simba and Young Nala 
were both very impressive vocally, especially consid
ering their young age. The voices that stood out most 
in the production were those of Nala (Lisa Nicole 
Wilkerson) and Scar, played by Dan Donohue. The 
entire cast was well-chosen, a necessity for a produc
tion that includes so many ensemble numbers.
Generally, the play maintained a theme very similar 
to that of the film version of The Lion King, with some 
differences that worked to make the musical appeal
ing to a wider public. New scenes, or sometimes new 
songs added to old scenes, made the plot seem fuller. 
The song that was by far the most beautifully per
formed in the play, though not the most grandiose, 
was Shadowland. It depicted Nala going forth to 
find food in the outer reaches of the kingdom after 
Scars policies and an unfortunate drought had driven 
all food from the land. The song is truly beautiful, and 
it helps to explain Nalas reunion with Simba more 
clearly than the film did. Yet all comparisons to the 
earlier form of The Lion King aside, the play in its 
entirety was full of strong voices, energetic charac
ters, and stage elements that convincingly portrayed 
everything from a stampede to a drying pond. One of 
the main challenges of creating this play was that it 
was full of non-human characters, yet Disneys musi
cal simply allows for the fact that every main charac
ter will walk on two legs, and the difference was hard
ly noticeable. The blend of human and animal that 
made the play work so well is exemplified by a scene 
in which Mufasa (Thomas Corey Robinson) removes 
his mask and claws and plays with his son.

A Woman is a woman
A French femme is driven by desire for a child
The renowned Nouvelle Vague director Jean-Luc 
Godards third film, 1961s Une Femme est Une Femme, 
pays tribute to the genre of the musical, while poking 
fun at typical notions of romance.
Anna Karina plays Angela, a striptease artist who 
suddenly decides that she wants a baby, and she 
wants it now. Though they would make one beautiful 
baby, her cycling and chain-smoking boyfriend Emile 
(Jean-Claude Brialy) is not quite so eager to wed and 
procreate. In fact, the couple is constantly bickering, 
just like the children Angela so desires.
More often than not, they find themselves not 
speaking to one another, leaving their most dynamic 
moments to pass without words.
During one wordless incident, the couple is lying in 
bed when Angela plucks a book from the shelf featur
ing the word Monster on the cover, insulting her 
lover without so much as a peep. Emile follows suit 
and quickly grabs numerous books from the shelf to 
show his little actress that two can play at her word
play. The mind games dont stop in the bedroom 
either.
Angela grows more and more anxious to get her 
ovaries back in action, so she threatens to conceive a 
child with the next man she sees.
Emile decides to up the stakes by proposing she do 
just that with their mutual friend Alfred. Alfred 
(Jean-Paul Belmondo) is actually in love with Angela 
and tries to convince Angela to leave Emile by per
forming great feats of love, such as ramming his head 
against a brick wall.
Angela, being in a state of constant confusion, 
cheats on Emile with Alfred and then quickly confess
es her sin.
Emile reacts rather coolly and in order to ensure 
the child will be his, proposes they make love imme
diately. Once the deed is done, the couple can sleep 
soundly and the woman gets what she wants.
This colorful and unpredictable 40-year-old film is 
one of Godards most accessible and enjoyable works. 
The use of shifting camera angles and choppy scene 
cuts, which are typical of the Nouvelle Vague style, is 
masterfully employed in A Woman is A Woman.
Godard is known for his unscripted scenes and his 
deliberately nonsensical plots, which shine through 
in this film as authentic moments within an artificial 
medium.
Godard never tries to disguise the workings of the 
film, and even permits the characters to directly 
address the audience during choice scenes. Such ele
ments taken from the genre of musical theater are 
woven throughout the film and tied together nicely 
by the vivant players.
Another risky technique Godard incorporates in 
this film is moments of straight text in lieu of dia
logue. This tactic of flashing phrases across the 
screen further undercuts some of the melodramatic 
clichs of romance.
The most compelling acting is done by the glam
orous former model Anna Karina. Karina won Best 
Actress for her role in A Woman is A Woman at the 
1961 Berlin Film Festival. A Woman is A Woman was 
Karinas second picture with Godard, who played the 
real-life role of her husband for several years. 
Karinas cat eyes and sexy voice make for a perfect 
Angela, who has two men dueling for her sultry 
French affections.
Besides Godards zany plot and Karinas seductive 
acting, the musical score by composer Michel 
Legrand interacts with and enhances the action of the 
film. The frantic rhythm of the score and noise-like 
ensembles complement the couples playful argu
ments.
The French version of the song Youve Let Yourself 
Go is allowed to completely dominate one of the end 
scenes, adding lyrics to Angelas facial expressions 
and embodying the comical, yet sentimental, ele
ments of the plot.
While this comedy employs several clever and witty 
spoofs on romance, some of the jokes get old by the 
second time around.
For instance, the literal book insulting was done 
twice; the mens playful dueling for Angelas affec
tions occurred more than once; certain lines like Je 
suis triste  I am sad  were repeated almost as 
many times as Emile took a drag of his cigarette.
It is this overkill that hinders the overall impact of 
the film; if seen as a statement about the sappy 
romances of the musical genre, however, such over
statements are perhaps justifiable.
Overall, this dark-humored look at what a modern 
woman wants in romance and in life during the early 
1960s promises a good laugh and some surprising 
visual indulgences by Godard. An hour well spent 
with one woman who is undoubtedly the perfect mix 
of comedy, drama, and insanity.

Along Came Polly
Same schtick, different movie  but this time with a ferret
Correct me if Im wrong, but I think I may have seen 
this one already. Jennifer Aniston assumes the role of 
the unlucky girlfriend whose beaus uptight hysterics 
encumber their romance, a la her relationship with 
Ross on the hit show Friends. Except this time, in her 
latest comedy Along Came Polly, shes opposite Ben 
Stiller as Reuben Feffer.
And, yes, Stiller. Once again, he seems to have 
found himself as the worlds whipping boy, victim to 
all that is morbidly hilarious in this world. From 
Theres Something About Mary to the infamous 
Zoolander, poor Ben just wants the affection and 
attention of others, even if it requires humiliation to 
the point of masochism. In Along Came Polly, Stiller 
and Zoolander/Meet the Parents screenwriter John 
Hamburg are at it again. Thankfully, they're treading 
on relatively new ground.
With a new wife, a new house in the suburbs, a 
cushy job in New York, and all the cushy dec
orative pillows a man could ever need,
Reuben Feffer couldnt ask for anything 
more. In fact, he probably wouldnt want 
to take the risk of asking for anything 
more. Thats because as a specialist for 
an insurance company, whose mother 
made him scared of everything while 
growing up, Reuben is an obsessivecompulsive who meticulously tries to 
avoid risks.
But while Reuben finds himself con
tent in a job rooted in computing the 
probability of mishaps, his biggest mis
calculation occurs during his honey
moon. This honeymoon gone wrong 
has his wife (Debra Messing) dumping 
him, as she is whisked away by a French 
nudist, played by Hank Azaria, who 
skillfully grabs into his bag of accents to 
delight without fail. After returning 
home, Hamburg captures Reubens deject
edness well, as Stiller creeps back to an apart
ment full of wedding gifts, hopeless.
But then again, this is a Stiller film, where selfdeprecating amusement reigns over all emotions. 
Without losing any comedic momentum, Reuben 
quickly enters the ocean of love with a little help 
from a friend, played wonderfully by Phillip 
Seymour Hoffman as Sandy.
Sandy, Reubens lifelong buddy, is a charming, 
older brother version of Jack Black, offering hilar
ious, yet seemingly thoughtful advice to Reuben 
in these troubled times. Hoffman, for the little 
amount of screen time given to him, shines in one 
of the movies cleverest bits, Sandys job as a com
munity theater actor. We see Sandy, a narcissistic 
thespian, playing Judas in the theater production of 
Jesus Christ Superstar, as he sings his heart out, 
yearning to steal attention away from Jesus himself. 
Unfortunately, these moments only remind the audi-. 
ence of Along Came Pollys failure to utilize Hoffmans
lrss/ont 19 egEdgTH 2004.
versatility, and that perhaps Hoffman should have 
taken the initiative and done more spotlight-grabbing 
from Stiller and Aniston.
But to be fair, Aniston, as the character after whom 
the movie is titled, works intently to deliver depth to a 
rather difficult role. For a character that presents her
self, at first, as a careless and clumsy ditz, Aniston 
captures the audience with Polly's energetic free
spiritedness and sincere honesty in her exchanges 
with Reuben.
Unfortunately, Hamburgs script com
promises sophistication with per
verse lightheartedGranted, Polly hints at a few flashes of insightful out
spokenness, confronting Reubens superficial need for 
decorative pillows and asking, How can you evaluate 
a risk youve never experienced? But there is more to 
be desired, comically and intellectually, from 
Anistons role, which takes a backseat to Stillers 
shenanigans.
Even then, for a movie that runs a concise and 
comfy hour and a half, Stillers comedic routines, 
unlike his past movies, are unsatisfying and spread 
too thin. From gross-out, like Reubens run-ins with 
faulty bodily functions, to plain pointless, like Pollys 
pet ferret running into things, many of the gags sur
rounding Stiller and Aniston disappoint. Despite any 
shortcomings from its stars, Along Came Polly has a 
great supporting cast of animated and imaginative 
characters, from Sandy to one of Reubens clients, a 
risk-taking extreme-sports aficionado, keenly played 
by Bryan Brown. Ultimately, this pageant of colorful 
characters hints at the better movie that Polly might 
have been.
While Pollys artistic vision doesnt intend to change 
the way we view love or risk-taking, it doesnt really 
fulfill its assumed goal  to be a cute romantic come
dy. In fact, the chemistry between Reuben and Polly 
often missing to the point where its not so much 
what attracts Polly to Reuben that is puzzling, but 
whether she is attracted to him or not. In fact, what 
could have been a pivotal turning point in the movie, 
where Polly demands of Reuben, What kind of man 
are you? quickly dissolves, cutting to the next scene 
where the couple are making out in his apartment.
Despite a clever premise and a scattering of witty 
jokes as when it subtly pokes fun at modern pop art  
the entertainment in Along Came Polly runs dry. To 
dwell on one of the movies more dominant comedy 
bits, Polly comes off like spicy food at a bad restau
rant: it may have the right ingredients, but it ends 
up unexciting, barely enticing your taste buds, 
possibly leaving you with a slightly unsettling 
feeling once you realize you spent eight 
bucks on it.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Some clucks believe that they have one chance at love in their 
life. If that chance is lost, they too are lost forever to the painful 
void of loneliness. Rupert was one of these ducks...until he beheld 
Cookie, the duckette who would change his life forever. After J
thinking his emotional life had been squelched for the rest of 
time, you can imagine Rupert's joyful astonishment at finding a new object of 
affection. Rupert became a duck obsessed. He dreamt about her every night and 
wrote about her in his Livejournal every day. Of course, he made up a code name 
for Cookie so that she wouldn't uncover his feelings for her. You see, after losing 
his dear Amy, Rupert was very wary of receiving another crushing wallop to the 
heart. He resolved never to become attached to another duck again and tried to 
convince himself that he would be happier that way. That is, until one day when 
Cookie overheard Rupert telling Quackers how totally hot she was...

What to Watch For 2 Thousand and 4
Although the changes began in Superman #200 in 
December, the remaining three months until April 
will be spent tying up story lines from current 
Superman stories and preparing the comics 
for their creative turnovers. Details about the 
new tales to debut in April are still relegated 
to rumors on the Internet. The most popular 
rumors suggest that in the conclusion of 
previous plot lines, three different dimen
sions are created, each containing a differ
ent Superman.
The Punisher
screen for another stab at the audience. The 
Punisher, starring Thomas Jane, John Travolta, and 
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, will help lead off the sum
mer movie action season on April 16.
The Punisher isnt the only character heading to 
theaters this summer, however. Two weeks before 
Frank Castle hits the streets, Mike Mignolas Hellboy 
will debut on movie screens. Dark Horse Comics 
most popular creation, Hellboy will tell the story of 
a Nazi-conjured demon who defects to the United 
States to police supernatural activity. Catwoman, 
title chracter played by Halle Berry, will dig her 
claws into audiences across the globe on July 30th. 
Finally, Marvel Comics has two other films set for 
release in August. Blade: Trinity stars Wesley Snipes 
in his third time around as the day-walking vam
pire. Man-Thing closes the summer blockbuster sea
son at the end of August with a horror based tale of 
a half man, half swamp creature. From comics to 
films, Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, and other comic 
companies hope to score big in 2004.
Vu3E Go,uem9 5loii0,ulw,
more aptly be titled Captain America versus The 
Falcon, as the Falcon has apparently violated 
national security, and the government has given 
Cap only 24 hours to track Falcon down and bring 
him in. Falcon uses everything Caps taught him 
against his former mentor as Falcon puts principle 
above the rule of law, the American ideal above the 
American government, but does so in a way Cap 
cannot entirely agree with. Captain America & The 
Falcon is one part of a new line of series to debut 
this March. Joined by other titles such as She-Hulk 
and Avengers Vs. Thunderbolts, Marvel is reaching 
out to fans less interested in subtle character intro
spection than classic buddy-hero action.
Superman
The original superhero attempts to reclaim his 
crown come April as the three main Superman 
titles are relaunched with high profile creators. 
Action Comics will be handled by Chuck Austen and 
Ivan Reis, Adventures of Superman will feature Greg 
Rucka and Matthew Clark, and Superman will be 
written and illustrated by Brian Azzarello and Jim 
Lee. The creative changes will attempt to redefine 
the comic book icon by dispelling a popular 
assumption, held by a large number of fans, that 
Superman is too much of a Boy Scout, and greatly 
lacking in personality. DC Comics looked towards 
their edgy west coast property WildStorm Comics 
to invigorate the world-renowned hero. WildStorm 
founder and superstar comic artist Jim Lee jumped 
on board to take another shot at a DC Comics clas
sic following his success with Batman in 2003.
The Punisher isnt so much a superhero as 
he is an enormous-gun-toting killing 
machine. Frank Castle has a vendetta, and 
he doesnt concern himself with human 
rights of criminals. He was popular 
enough in 1989 to garner a failed attempt 
at box office success. Now, 15 years later, 
after the success of Spider-Man-, X-Men-, 
and Daredevil-inspired films, Marvels reck
less vigilante has returned to the silver

Man-Thing to be released this August.
The new spring semester means a return to class, 
late night studies, and hitting the books. For dedi
cated comic book fans such as myself, the new 
semester also means many hours on the Internet 
researching upcoming superhero projects. With 
superheroes officially acknowledged as pop cul
tures latest money-making passion, comic book 
companies have shifted their sights to their more 
mainstream properties. Heres a short collection of 
comics and movies to look for in 2004:
Captain America & The Falcon
Hot to follow the new creative direction of the 
Marvel Knights Captain America series, Marvel 
Comics has stepped up to offer a classic Cap book as 
an action-packed companion. Captain America &
The Falcon is under the jurisdiction of the Marvel 
Heroes branch. CAF is written by veteran fanfavorite Christopher Priest, longtime author of 
Black Panther. Priest is joined by artist Bart Sears, 
another fan-favorite who was most recently an art 
director and penciler for CrossGen Comics.
Captain America appeared monthly with the Falcon 
throughout the 1970s, fighting crime everywhere 
from the streets of NYC to outer space. In his
weblog, Christopher Priest 
describes the initial story line 
of CAF: The opening arc, Two 
Americas,
