Written by 19-year-old Californian Sherman 
Austin, a copy of the guide containing this and 
many other recipes for explosives can be found

by Sar Mellon Computer Science
b Professor David Touretzky.
HyHenrgr In September 2001, Austin
published a Reclaim 
Guide of instructions for resisting arrest during 
riots and manufacturing a variety of weapons on 
his self-proclaimed anarchist website,

Federal agents raided Austins San Fernando 
Valley home on January 24 and confiscated com
puter equipment, political literature, and items 
for making explosives.
A week and a half later, the teen was arrested 
during World Economic Forum demonstrations 
in New York and charged with violating 1997 US 
Code title 18, section 842, which prohibits the 
demonstration of how to make or use explosives 
and weapons of mass destruction with the inten
tion that the information will be used for violent 
crimes.
Last Monday, Austin entered a guilty plea to 
one felony count of violating the statute. He 
could face one month in jail, five months in a 
halfway home, and three years of probation. 
Prosecutors are also asking that Austin have 
reasonable limitations on computer access 
which could prohibit him from running

The site no longer contains the Reclaim Guide
and there is a disclaimer stating that the site 
does not encourage illegal activities.
One of the few nearly-complete copies of the 
Reclaim Guide still available on the Internet has 
been posted on the University-owned website of 
Touretzky since the end of January 2002.
Touretzky, who declined to comment, states 
on his website that he questions the validity of 
title 18, section 842, and that he wishes to 
encourage public debate of the Austin case 
through his own publication of potentially illegal 
materials. Touretzky includes multiple dis
claimers on his site that he does not advocate 
violence or agree with the personal beliefs of 
Austin.
As Austin faces jail time for the very content 
now found on Touretzkys website, some campus 
members are debating the ethical and legal 
implications of the Reclaim Guide.
I feel that since there is no legitimate reason 
for distributing information pertaining to street 
weapons, such information should not be pre
sent on the Internet, said Nicole Saulnier, a 
sophomore electrical and computer engineering 
major and chair of the College Republicans. If 
someone stood downtown in Pittsburgh and 
gave lessons on building a bomb to anyone who 
decided to listen, that individual would be repre
senting a clear danger to the country. It doesnt 
matter what that individual believes  he is still 
teaching people whose beliefs he does not know 
or control.
I think Dr. Touretzky is just being consistent 
with his philosophy, which is admirable, said 
Quinten Steenhuis, a junior in logic and compu
tation. His stance makes sense to me, although 
we can certainly question whether this was the 
right cause to take a stand for.
John Lerchey, computer and network security 
coordinator, explained that Touretzkys copy of 
the Reclaim Guide is within the bounds of 
University website content policy. Lerchey said 
that pornography, copyrighted materials, and

Candidates differ on environment, crime, health care
by Matt Rado
-nSHyr famiizrHasr
With the November 5 gubernatori
al election rapidly approaching, the 
candidates for Pennsylvania gover
nor heatedly debate the issues that 
will impact the states future.
The race offers an especially 
diverse group of candidates, with a 
variety of opinions, backgrounds, 
and ages.
The current leader in the race is 
Democratic candidate Ed Rendell. 
Rendell served as the mayor of 
V
Philadelphia from 1992 to 1999 and 
as the citys district attorney from 
1978 to 1985.
His focus is twofold: economic 
revitalization, job creation, and 
reforming Pennsylvanias system of 
public education and cutting proper
ty taxes in the process, said Rendells 
press secretary, Chuck Ardo.
Rendells education plan includes 
more state funding, for up to 50 per
cent of public school budgets. The 
cost of this would be offset by legaliz
ing slot machines at horse racing 
tracks and by doubling the current 
cigarette tax. As a part of his plan,
*
Rendell would require local school 
districts to reduce property taxes by 
the amount gained in the cigarette 
tax increase.
Another part of the Rendell plan 
calls for mandatory pre-kindergarten.
Mike Fisher, the Republican candi
date for governor, also has a number 
of proposals to improve the current 
education situation in Pennsylvania. 
Fisher is the current state attorney 
general, a position to which he was 
elected in November 1996. He was 
first elected to the Pennsylvania 
House in 1974 and to the
Pennsylvania Senate in 1980.
One part of his education plan calls 
for a special session of the general 
assembly to solve the current educa
tion funding crisis.
In addition, Fisher supports the 
use of school vouchers to give parents 
more freedom in deciding where 
their children are educated. An 
important part of the Fisher plan 
includes limiting state control of 
local school districts.

Candidate, would like to see a gradu-^

The CMU chapter of Delta Tau 
Delta (DTD) could face a full mem
bership review says Garth Eberhart, 
assistant executive vice president of 
the national chapter.
He said that DTD has been on pro
bation since April 2002 for having a 
keg in the house, which violates risk 
management policies. Coupled with 
the August 30 incident in which two 
women were cited for dancing top
less in an alleged DTD Girls Gone 
Wild contest, the fraternity may 
face disciplinary measures at both 
the local and national level.
Eberhart said that DTD has been 
given the option of first disciplining 
themselves.
Our preference is that they take 
care of their members, and govern 
themselves, said Eberhart. Lets see 
what theyve learned from this.
If further action is deemed neces
sary, he predicts more sanctions will 
be imposed on the chapter, whose 
current probation was to have ended 
in December.
Penalties could include a fine of up 
to $150 for each member or a campus-wide educational program to be 
sponsored by the chapter.
Eberhart also discussed a potential 
membership review.
We would look at each member, 
and decide whether or not he is con
tributing to the betterment of the 
organization, said Eberhart. The 
review could end with at least one of 
the members being expelled or sus
pended from the chapter.
He does not believe that the chap
ters charter will be revoked.
Campus Police plans to continue 
its investigation of the incident and 
to prosecute the offenders.
Campus Police chief Creig Doyle 
said that he had never heard of any

On Tuesday at 6 pm, a rally sponsored by the 
Committee for Peace in the Middle East will be 
held to protest former Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahus Middle East policies.
The rally will coincide with a scheduled 
appearance by Netanyahu at 8 pm at Heinz 
Hall. Robert Morris University invited 
Netanyahu to kick off a new lecture series.
This will be a great event for Pittsburgh and 
Robert Morris University, said Mark Weinstein, 
Robert Morris University director of public rela
tions.
The protest rally was organized by several 
groups, including the University of Pittsburghs 
Students in Solidarity, the Palestine Solidarity 
Committee, the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, 
and Carnegie Mellons Arab Student 
Organization and Zi Activism.
According to Tim Vining, executive director 
of the Pittsburgh-based Thomas Merton Center, 
the rally will begin with a march.
Its going to be a peaceful and legal rally, 
said Pete Shell, a board member of the Center. 
We just want an alternative point of view to be 
heard  a very important point of view.
According to Shell, a mock funeral march is 
scheduled to commemorate Palestinian victims 
of the Israeli occupation.
A number of speakers will be present at the 
rally, including noted pacifist Staughton Lynd.
Lynd, who graduated from Harvard 
University, is well-known for his activism dur
ing the Vietnam War and during the Civil Rights 
Movement of the 1960s. He was also an assis
tant professor of history at Yale University and a 
labor law attorney.

Susan Kost is tired of the double 
standard.
Why does society expect men to 
be rowdy and women to sit together 
and have nice little tea parties? I 
dont think there is a problem with 
women being rowdy, said Kost, a 
senior physics major.
Kost became upset when she dis
covered that members of sororities, 
citing their belief that women and 
men are inherently different, accept 
rules that are more stringent than 
those imposed on fraternities.
Kost doesnt buy it.
Maybe they should ask them
selves why they feel different from 
men, because they shouldnt. They 
are perpetuating stereotypes and 
restricting themselves under regula
tions that were established long 
before the feminist revolution. These 
rules are no longer applicable, said 
Kost.
Sororities currently adhere to com
paratively stricter rules regarding 
membership recruitment, risk man
agement, and general behavior.
As a member of the campus 
Womens Center and an outsider to 
the Greek community, Kost finds it 
difficult to understand why a coali
tion of women would not try to close 
the gender gap.
But Delta Delta Delta sister Elsie 
Lampl, a senior professional and cre
ative writing major, sees the situation 
differently.
On a national level, the stricter 
rules happen because women  and 
sorority women especially  are 
stereotyped a lot quicker than men, 
said Lampl. Thats just the way that 
it is in America.

The few upperclass students who 
found themselves in Schatz Dining 
Room last Tuesday night between 5 
and 7 pm might have noticed that the 
all-you-care-to-eat (AYCTE) dinner 
buffet is not quite so crowded this 
fall. Since spring semester, atten
dance has decreased almost 50 per
cent to a disappointing 200 students 
each Tuesday night, according to 
Jane Fahringer, resident district 
manager of Parkhurst Dining 
Services.
Nearly all of Schatzs customers 
are first-year students, many of 
whom are still discovering the details 
of dining at Carnegie Mellon. 
Traditionally, students learn about 
dining options during first-year ori
entation. However, during orienta
tion 2002, Carnegie Mellons Dining 
Services failed to advertise the 
Schatz AYCTE buffet to the group of 
students most likely to frequent it.
At orientation we were only told 
about the breakfast buffet. When 
[my friends and I] asked about an allyou-can-eat lunch or dinner, we were 
told there wasnt one, said first-year 
engineering student Juan Chen.
Fahringer blamed the warm 
weather for the current low turnout 
at Schatz and expects more people to
dine there when the weather turns 
cold. She also said that any informa
tion students need about dining 
options at Carnegie Mellon can be 
found on the Dining Services web
site. She did not know how many vis
itors the website gets on average 
each day.
The website lists Schatz Dining 
Room as a breakfast option for stu
dents and shows no evidence of the 
Tuesday night buffet. Interested stu
dents might notice a small announce
ment about the hot new features at 
Schatz in the current news portion 
of the website, but again, no time or 
day is disclosed.
Schatz gained popularity as a 
Monday night AYCTE dining venue 
during February and March. On 
February 25, the buffet served 363 
people, with 90 percent of customers 
on a meal plan. To address increasing 
demands, Dining Services planned to 
expand Schatz's offerings.
According to the SDC food com
mittees minutes for March 18, 
Fahringer had hoped to open the buf
fet twice each week during the fall 
semester. The food committee and 
Dining Services also considered 
restricting access to the seating 
above the pool and using the area as 
an overflow for Schatz. However, low 
attendance at the venue during the

Bombs explode in 
theater and circus
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP)  At 
least four bombs exploded Saturday 
in a packed movie theater and a 
crowded circus show in southwestern 
Bangladesh, killing at least 10 people 
and injuring 200, police said.
The death toll was likely to rise 
fcince many of the injured were taken 
to hospitals in serious condition, a 
police official said on condition of 
anonymity.
' Two bombs went off at Roxie 
Cinema Hall, a movie theater in 
Satkhira town, 110 miles southwest 
of the capital, Dhaka. A capacity 
crowd was watching the evening 
show, the officer said.
Within minutes and a few blocks 
away, two more bombs blew up in a 
crowded circus show at a stadium in 
the town center, the officer said.
The explosions occurred as thou
sands of people, many of them chil
dren, were in the streets to celebrate 
Gurpukur Fair, a century-old festival 
honoring a local Hindu king. Muslims 
also participate in the festival.
There was no immediate claim of 
responsibility for the explosions.
Hospitals and health centers were 
overwhelmed by the arrivals of the 
injured people, many with severed 
legs or hands, United News of 
Bangladesh news agency reported.
Hundreds of anxious  relatives of 
the victims gathered at the scenes of 
the blasts and outside hospitals.
Stampede in India 
Causes 14 deaths
LUCKNOW, India (AP)  
Thousands of people stampeded 
toward a railway station in northern 
India September 28, killing at least 14 
and injuring another 19, officials 
said.
More casualties were feared as 
police tried to restore order in the 
area and open the way for emergency 
services, a senior police official said.
Fourteen bodies had been recov
ered, he said. The injured were taken 
to several hospitals in Lucknow, capi
tal of Uttar Pradesh, Indias political 
heardand and most populous state.
Hundreds of thousands of mem
bers of the ruling Bahujan Samaj 
Party (BSP) had assembled in 
Lucknow Saturday for a massive 
show of strength.
The stampede occurred as political
workers tried to force their way 
toward the railroad station to get into 
already overcrowded trains, said 
Divisional Railway Manager Kamlesh 
Gupta.
Crowds swelled on Saturday as 
hundreds of thousands of people 
poured into the city on buses, trains, 
and cars from different parts of the 
state. By late evening, the crowds had 
gone out of control and people spilled 
on to the roads, blocking traffic and 
clashing with drivers.
The BSP represents the underclass, 
especially members of the lowest 
castes in the Hindu social hierarchy. 
It has swiftly emerged as a powerful 
political force over the past decade.
Britons march to 
stop war on Iraq
LONDON (AP)  More than
50.000 Britons from all regions, ages 
and social backgrounds marched in 
central London September 28, urging 
Prime Minister Tony Blair and 
President Bush not to invade Iraq.
As they wound their way from 
Embankment on the River Thames to 
Hyde Park, many of the demonstra
tors stopped to shout through the 
gates of Blairs 10 Downing Street res
idence.
Tony Blair, shame, shame, no 
more killing in my name, went one 
chant.
Tam Dalyell, who holds the title 
Father of the House of Commons, 
said the Iraq dilemma was the most 
dangerous standoff since the Cuban 
missile crisis.
We are sleepwalking to disaster, 
he said.
Scotland Yard said it was still work
ing on a crowd estimate but that 
there were more than 50,000 demon
strators.
Andrew Burgin, of the Stop the 
War Coalition, which helped orga
nize the march, said there were
250.000 people and added that the 
crowd was still growing.
The march came as Britain and the 
United States worked together on a 
draft resolution on Iraq which they 
plan to propose to the United 
Nations.
Blair has been Bushs staunchest 
ally on Iraq and last week released a 
dossier claiming Saddam Hussein has 
stockpiled chemical and biological 
weapons, and is trying to develop 
nuclear arms.
Legislators from the prime minis
ters own Labor Party are among the 
leaders of the Stop the War Coalition, 
which organized the march with the 
Muslim Association of Britain.

Congress closer to 
authorizing force
CRAWFORD, Texas (AP)  
President Bush says Congress, guided 
by leaders of both parties, is nearing 
agreement on a resolution authoriz
ing the use of force against Iraqs 
Saddam Hussein.
He said the Democratic and 
Republican leaders with whom he 
met this week are united in their 
determination to confront what he 
called a grave and growing danger 
posed by Iraq to the national security 
interests of the United States and its 
allies.
In a move to win international 
approval for action to disarm Iraq, 
the United States has drafted a tough 
resolution for the United Nations 
Security Council that would force 
Iraq to reveal all weapons of mass 
destruction in its arsenal and give 
inspectors from the UN total access to 
verify the information.
The resolutions wording was to 
win over skeptical China, France, and 
Russia, who can veto any resolution. 
The United States and its close ally, 
Britain, are the other veto powers.
In Baghdad, Iraqi Vice President 
Taha Yassin Ramadan rejected the 
draft resolution, and Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq Aziz warned that the 
United States would suffer losses 
that have not been sustained for 
decades if it attacked his country.
Russia held to its line that no new 
resolution is needed.
The president, however, still has a 
way to go in building firm bipartisan 
support. Senate Majority Leader Tom 
Daschle, once an advocate of grant
ing Bush the right to strike Hussein, is 
now questioning the administrations 
political motives as the November 5 
midterm elections draw near.
On Friday, speaking before 
Republican audiences in Colorado 
and Arizona, Bush repeatedly made
clear that while war is a possibility, it 
is not his first option, and that he 
would prefer a peaceful resolution of 
the crisis under the auspices of the 
UN.
Im willing to give peace a chance 
to work. I want the United Nations to 
work, Bush said in Denver.
Our last choice is to commit our 
troops to harms way, Bush added. 
But if we have to, to defend our free
doms, the United States will lead a 
coalition and do so.
Toogood reported 
wrong address
MISHAWAKA, Ind. (AP)  A 
woman accused of hitting her 4-yearold daughter in a beating caught on 
videotape was charged with giving 
police false addresses after her surren
der.
Prosecutors expected Madelyne 
Gorman Toogood to turn herself in a 
second time, this time on a warrant 
charging her with false informing, a 
misdemeanor.
Toogood, 25, was released on 
$5,000 bond earlier this week. She 
had turned herself in and pleaded 
innocent to felony battery of a child in 
the September 13 incident in a depart
ment store parking lot, which was 
caught on a surveillance camera and 
televised nationally.
Authorities say Toogood gave them 
addresses for commercial mailbox 
businesses in Mishawaka and Elkhart, 
Indiana and Fort Worth, Texas.
Toogood has said she and her hus
band belong to the nomadic group 
Irish Travellers, but have been living in 
Mishawaka for about six months.
Bond on the new charge was set at 
$2,000. A conviction is punishable by 
a maximum six months in jail or a 
$1,000 fine.
Toogood is seeking to have her 
daughter, who was placed in a foster 
home, stay with relatives while she 
tries to regain permanent custody. 
Toogood also has two young sons who 
remain in her custody.

US News ensures 
Ivys ranked high
TUSCALOOSA (U-WIRE)  
The Gf kszo rankings are a source 
of pride for many faculty members 
and administrators, who see them 
as confirmation of a job well done.
Gf kszo started publishing col
lege rankings in 1983, and its ini
tial methodology was simply to 
ask university presidents to rank 
the top five colleges in each cate
gory (national doctoral, liberal 
arts, etc.). In 1988, according to a 
GSH9sroHad yi btHpmgy wmgmFHSs 
report, Gf kszo brought in a sta
tistician to develop a more scien
tific formula by which colleges 
could be ranked but fired the sta
tistician after her formula placed a 
small seminary at the top of the 
list. Gf kszo hired a second statis
tician, who came up with a 
methodology that placed Yale 
University on top.
The editor responsible for the 
issue, Mel Elfin, was quoted in the 
AmotHSgayS wySat,d as unapologetic about his determination to 
get the Ivy League schools on top 
of his rankings.
When youre picking the most 
valuable player in baseball and a 
utility player hitting .220 comes 
up as the MVP, its not right, he 
said.
Since then, Harvard, Yale, or 
Princeton has occupied the top 
spot every year but 1999, when 
California Institute of Technology
came out on top. After that issue, Gf 
kszo recalculated its formula to deemphasize per-student spending, an 
area in which Caltech enjoyed a sig
nificant advantage. Since then, 
Harvard, Yale, and Princeton have 
enjoyed another uninterrupted run 
on top. This years edition lists 
Princeton first, Harvard second, and 
Yale third.
Explosives found 
in MT dorm room
MISSOULA, Mont. (U-WIRE)  A 
University of Montana student was 
arrested late Wednesday September 
25 after Public Safety officers found 
explosives inside his Jesse Hall dorm 
room.
Dereck Stairs, a sophomore in com

with felony possession of explosives.
According to court documents, 
Public Safety officers found a large 
prescription bottle filled with gun
powder, primer blasting caps and 
matchstick heads in the microwave of 
Stairs fifth-floor room. The bottle 
cap had a small hole drilled into it 
and a three-inch fuse sitting next to it.
Ron Brunell, director of Residence 
Life, said this is the most disturbing 
incident to happen in the dorms this 
year and one of the worst in the 15 
years he has been in his position.
Two Resident Assistants called 
Public Safety after they saw Stairs, 
20, walk into Jesse Hall carrying an 
electrical cord with exposed wires 
and what appeared to be shotgun 
shells or dynamite, according to the 
court affidavit.
No plea or sentence will be sought

Gays feel unsafe 
at Clemson
CLEMSON, S.C. (U-WIRE)  In 
a recent Princeton Review survey, 
Clemson University ranked fourth 
among schools that do not accept 
alternative lifestyles, meaning 
gays, lesbians, bisexuals and 
transsexuals.
As a gay student, Megan Huff, a 
junior in nursing, describes events 
in her life at Clemson as threat
ening. As a first-year, someone 
broke into her room during spring 
break and posted vulgar fliers on 
her bed and marked her room up 
with assaulting messages. Her RA 
filed a report, but she claims noth
ing was done about it.
Clemson is still a couple steps 
behind, said Dr. Peter Cohen, fac
ulty advisor for Bnai Brith Hillel. 
He said he knows of at least one 
faculty member who is out 
everywhere else but Clemson.
A committee to create a new 
diversity calendar listed National 
Gay Awareness Month under

dents and faculty expressed 
extreme discomfort in this refer
ence.

McKEESPORT, Penn. (AP)  An 
Amtrak train bound for Chicago 
made an unscheduled stop in a 
Pittsburgh suburb when a passenger 
made a bomb threat, an FBI 
spokesman said.
The Capitol Limited train, which 
left from Washington, D.C., stopped 
near McKeesport at about 11:30 pm 
September 22. The 104 passengers 
and 15 crew members got off while 
the FBI, the Allegheny County bomb 
squad, and a bomb-sniffing dog 
searched the train for explosives, said 
Amtrak spokeswoman Karina Van 
Veen.
No explosives were found, said FBI 
Special Agent Bill Crowley.
Police arrested Raymond Lamont 
Smith, 27, who had an outstanding

Steel corporation 
receives OH loan
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  The 
state has committed a $12 million 
loan guarantee to WheelingPittsburgh Steel Corp. as it tries to 
secure financing to emerge from 
bankruptcy.
Wheeling-Pitt, based in Wheeling, 
WV, has applied for a $250 million 
loan under the Emergency Steel Loan 
Guarantee program, which was creat
ed in 1999 to help strapped steel com
panies secure needed funding from 
private banks.
The company, which has several 
plants in southeast Ohio, filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
November 2000.
Dozens of domestic steel compa
nies have filed for bankruptcy or gone 
out of business since 1998. The steel 
industry blames its problems on for
eign steel dumped in the US market at 
prices below the cost of production.
If Wheeling-Pitt is approved for the 
loan, the federal government will 
guarantee paying back a minimum of 
85 percent of the $250 million, said 
James Kosowski, a spokesman for the 
steel company.

Teens first have 
sex in their home
WASHINGTON (AP)  Parents 
wondering if their teenagers are 
having sex might look upstairs or 
down the hall. New research finds 
most sexually active teens first had 
sex in their parents homes, typi
cally late at night.
The findings dispel myths that 
teens are most often having sex 
after school, when parents are still 
at work, researchers said. The mes
sage for parents, experts say, is 
nothing new: Be aware of what 
your kids are up to.
Kids no longer need to drive to 
Lookout Point to have sex, said 
Sarah Brown, director of the 
National Campaign to Prevent 
Teen Pregnancy. The data suggest 
the adults may be in the house.
By the time students are in the 
ninth grade, 34 percent have had 
sexual intercourse. That rises to 60 
percent by 12th grade.
The report, by researchers at 
Child Trends, is based on a nation
al teen survey that has been track
ing about 8,000 teens since 1997. 
The ages of the teens ranged from 
12-16 when the survey began, and 
researchers have interviewed the 
same group every year since then. 
This report looks specifically at the 
664 teens who reported having sex 
for the first time between 1999 and 
2000.
Of those surveyed in 2000, 56 
percent said they first had sex at 
their familys home or at the home 
of their partners family.
Another 12 percent had sex first 
at a friends house; nine percent at 
a teens own home; four percent in 
a truck or car; three percent at a 
park or other outdoor place and 
three percent at a hotel or motel. 
Ten percent said someplace else.
Blind alligator 
takes mans arm
GAINESVILLE (U-WIRE)  
Doctors at Shands at the University 
of Florida were unable to re-attach 
the severed forearm of Don 
Goodman, the Kanapaha Gardens 
director who lost the limb 
September 23 during an alligator 
attack.
An 11-foot alligator, nicknamed 
Mojo by the Kanapaha staff, 
snapped Goodmans right arm off 
Monday while he was working in 
the water garden.
As he was moving the water, 
the alligator thought it was some
thing to eat and bit his arm, said 
Barbara Bennett, a Kanapaha gar
dener.
Deputies with the Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation 
Commission then raced to retrieve 
the severed arm from the reptiles 
stomach. The trappers harpooned 
Mojo, who managed to ram the 
boat and knock a trapper into the 
water, said Captain Roy Brown of 
the conservation commission.
Brown speculated that the alli
gators age might have been the 
reason for the attack because older 
alligators tend to go blind. This 
alligator was about 50 years old.

Economics moving 
to the cutting edge
Changes in the 40-year-old under
graduate economics curriculum are 
expected to put students at the cut
ting edge of economics research. A 
greater emphasis on mathematics 
and statistics will highlight the new 
course plans, and students will gain 
greater exposure to the professional 
world through a required senior pro
ject and a new first-year economics 
seminar.
Starting with incoming first-years, 
economics majors will be required to 
take an introductory programming 
class and a 200-level professional 
writing class.
The mathematics requirement for 
the economics program has been 
expanded to include a second semes
ter of calculus, as well as an interme
diate level statistics class.
These requirements stem from con
cern that economics students are not 
receiving the level of mathematics 
that will be expected of them in grad
uate school.
There is a big gap between where 
undergraduate programs leave off 
and where graduate programs start, 
said Patrick Sileo, director of the 
undergraduate economics program. 
This new curriculum will prepare 
students for a change in the econom
ics profession to a more qualitative 
and analytical field.
A new senior project requirement 
will give undergraduates the oppor
tunity to use the analytical abilities 
that they have cultivated for the past 
three years.
Sileo said graduate schools and 
employers will look more favorably 
toward Carnegie Mellon students 
because, they can point to work that 
they did. Its a recruiting tool.
While the changes will only offi
cially affect the first-year economics 
majors, upperclass students are 
encouraged to fulfill the new require
ments as well.
Great Race brings.;' 
together thousands
Thousands of runners took to the 
streets yesterday for the 26th annual 
Richard S. Caliguiri City ,of 
Pittsburgh Great Race. The race is 
composed of several different com
petitions including a 10K and 5K runj 
5K walk, team, wheelchair, heavy7 
weight, and costume competitions, 
and a Junior Great Race.
The 10K race runs for 6.3 miles 
from Beechwood Cemetery at th$ 
end of Frick Park and follows Fifth 
Avenue downtown to the Boulevard 
of the Allies which heads directly , to 
the Point. The 5K begins at Atwood 
Street in Oakland.
The Great Race has built a tradi
tion of including runners of all ages 
and backgrounds.
Its not a race for competitive run
ners only, said Mary Beth Muelle,r, 
the public relations representative 
for the race. Its for every man.iq 
the back of the pack.
The race traditionally attracts ,a 
large number of Carnegie -Mellori 
students. Michael Cox, a sophomore* 
music major and Pittsburgh native, 
runs the race every year.
Holly Rihn, a junior drama major 
had never participated in a race 
before.
Im running the race just to see if I 
can, she said, I thought it would be 
fun even if I collapse and die halfway 
through it. ; ,
In addition to individual participktion, CIT organized three teams run
ning in this years race, led by Civil 
and Environmental Engineering pro
fessor Cliff Davidson.
Last year, CIT took first and second 
place prizes in the educational team 
category.
I think we did really well, said 
Davidson, who organized one of the 
teams, All three teams finished and 
I hope we get a clean sweep.
One dollar from every fee collect1 
ed from race entrants goes to the

Students report 
sexual assault
On Sunday, September 22, two 
female University of Pittsburgh stu
dents reported that they were sex
ually assaulted at gunpoint while 
walking up University Drive just 
past the Chevron Building at 11:28 
pm.
The African-American male 
jumped out of the bushes with a 
gun as the two walked up 
University Drive which is a lighted 
main thoroughfare through cam
pus.
The suspect was described as 
being 45 years old and approxi
mately 510 in height. He had a 
large build and his head was 
shaved. He was wearing a white 
shirt and dark pants and was 
armed with a black handgun.
Man convicted in 
death of student
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
Unless his appeal is upheld, 
Matthew Kaguyutan will never be 
a fre6 man again.
Judge Lawrence OToole sen
tenced the former University of 
Pittsburgh student, convicted of 
second-degree murder, among 
other charges, this summer, to life 
without parole in the Pittsburgh 
state correctional facility, ending a 
trial process that lasted nearly two 
years.
Kaguyutan was accused of stalk
ing Carissa Probst, his ex-girl
friend, and setting fire to apart
ments she inhabited on two sepa
rate occasions. The second fire, 
which occurred September 29, 
2000, killed Joseph Marcinek, 
another Pitt student.
The defendant, Probst, and the 
loved ones of the deceased all 
expressed intense feelings to the 
court.
He may not have taken my life, 
but hes taken the life out of me,
said a tearful Probst, who described a 
gauntlet of psychological fallout and 
therapeutic expenses since the fatal 
fire.
Marcineks parents, Peggy and 
Joseph, read statements to the court 
describing the last two years of their 
lives, beginning with September 28,
2000, when she spoke with her son 
about a job fair he attended that day.
I didnt realize at the time that 
that would be the last time I ever 
heard his voice, Marcineks mother 
said.
Marcineks mother told the court 
she has been reliving her sons death 
for the duration of the trial, and that 
Kaguyutan was mentally raping her 
family every day of their lives.
Marcineks father had an angrier 
message for OToole. His family 
should have to suffer like we are suf
fering now, he said.
He should die the way my son 
died, he said, or just give him to me 
for five minutes.
Kaguyutan was the only speaker 
for the defense, and he asked to 
address the court  more specifical
ly the Marcinek family  directly.
I am praying for you, he told 
them, that you may somehow come 
to peace and receive comfort.
He said even though he had been 
found guilty, he could not apologize 
for what he claimed he did not do.
Students polish 
etiquette skills
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  Few 
college meals involve business attire 
and multiple utensils, but more than 
60 students braved the rules of dining 
decorum Tuesday night at University 
of Pittsburghs International Business 
Etiquette Dining Event.
Before digging into a five-course 
meal that included soup, salad, 
bread, a chosen entree and dessert, 
attending students had to learn prop
er manners for situations ranging 
from a lunch interview to a business 
dinner.
The lecture also covered foreign 
dining customs. Students learned that 
its an honor to be served a fish head 
in Hong Kong, and that not slurping 
your noodles in Japan may offend 
your hosts.

Sororities cater to different 
needs of female collegians
When sororities were first 
founded, they were formed in a 
society where women werent 
equal, but they were not keeping 
the times in mind. They were keep
ing in mind notions of woman
hood, said Sue Yeh, a graduate stu
dent in information systems and a 
member of Delta Delta Delta. The 
rules reflect maintaining good char
acter and conduct.
Her fellow sister Kristin Palechak, 
a senior industrial design major, 
agreed and cited public opinion as 
another driving force for sororities 
to maintain a good image through
only a few fraternities were giving 
the rest of the Greek community 
this reputation, Marsh said he did 
not think so.
If they are doing as much good 
as they are partying, then they need 
to do a better job about publicizing 
their good. They do one big event 
with Greek Sing, but then they 
party every weekend. It doesnt 
equate, said Marsh.
Joe Revelli, a sophomore physics 
major and a brother at Delta 
Upsilon, feels that his fraternitys 
parties are a service to the student 
body.
Id say a lot of people need a 
place to party every week, to relieve 
stress, and thats enough to justify 
fraternities to the rest of the world, 
said Revelli. Everything else on top 
of it like Booth and Greek Sing goes 
to charity. We are really doing some 
good.
Revelli is not bothered by the 
public scrutiny of Greeks and 
believes that variances between fra
ternities and sororities stem from 
what he perceives as intrinsic differ
ences.
Men and women are not equal," 
said Revelli. "We are very similar in 
some ways but we have very differ
ent needs.
It is clear that Greek chapters and 
members of the campus community 
notice variations between individ
ual fraternities and sororities.
For Kost, these discrepancies 
show that there are cracks within 
the Greek system that she cannot 
accept.
I feel that sororities and fraterni
ties are just trying to maintain an 
image on the outside, but they are 
probably not upholding them indi
vidually, said Kost.
Maybe thats why I havent 
joined. I dont want to be labeled as 
something because Im in a sororiGREEKS, from page Al
other cases of topless dance con
tests at Carnegie Mellon. It's not 
that these kids dont have good com
mon sense  they do. But its also 
typical for kids of this age to have this 
feeling of invincibility  that things 
dont happen to me,  said Doyle.
You do the crime, you have to be 
prepared to do the time, said 
Detective Martin White.
Campus police declined further 
comment on the details of the case 
until the investigation is closed.
Renee Camerlengo, director of stu
dent life, said that concerned stu
dents should see DTDs recent inci
dent as an isolated occurance.
I dont believe its prevalent. 
People shouldnt feel uncomfortable 
interacting with the Greek communi
ty, said Camerlengo. However, 
Camerlengo does believe that the 
incident was unfortunate. I think 
this is making women on campus 
give pause. Its not the norm, but it 
gives you a sinking feeling. You want 
it to be different.
Student sentiment is mixed.
I go to DTD all the time and I think 
its one of the nicest frats. Those girls 
deserve to take the responsibility for 
this, said Leticia Arslanian, a senior 
business major.
If the girls had just been drunk, 
they just would have continued to do 
their own thing. It wouldnt have hap
pened if the frats didnt make them 
do it, said Kathy Saye, a first-year 
psychology major.
DTD was unable to comment on 
the specifics of the case.
When a fraternity is involved in an 
investigation, regardless of the nature 
of the incident, or their implication in 
the matter, any official comment by 
the fraternity can potentially jeopar
dize the outcome of the investiga
tion, said DTD president Andrew 
Bayowski, a fifth-year materials sci
ence and engineering student.
cult for the women of her sorority to 
defy the rules that the national 
council imposes on them, simply 
because these rules are in line with 
popular sentiment.
Kost still asks why.
I feel that you shouldnt keep 
something just because it is tradi
tion if it is not applicable today. You 
should not be expected to play in 
the traditional role of a woman  
thats why they started sororities in 
the first place, right? To band 
together against these stereotypes? 
Sally Grant, the chairwoman of 
the national Pan Hellenic 
Conference, the national organiza
tion that governs most sorority 
chapters, says that this is not neces
sarily the case.
Sororities started because col
lege existed for men, and the 
women were treated very poorly on 
campuses when they initially start
ed going to co-educational schools. 
Usually 100 percent of the profes
sors were male and the men didnt 
want them there, said Grant.
Because of this opposition, the 
women assembled together to try 
and create something better for 
themselves. This did not mean, 
however, that their primary agenda 
was to fight gender discrimination.
A lot of our roots are founded in 
gender equality, but more than that, 
they are founded in sisterhood, 
said Grant. In a society that isnt all 
that equitable for a women, this 
group supports females.
In an effort to provide support, 
sororities enforce uniform rules on 
their members that they hope will 
make each individual proud to be a 
part of the group.
Most sorority women do not 
think that the rules are negative or 
unfair; rather, they welcome the 
strict standards.
If the sororities 
threw parties like 
the fraternities 
did, people would 
be much quicker 
to judge us.

perception, though. Due to a change 
in the meal block structure, students 
on meal plans were given more free
dom to spend their blocks at other 
retail food outlets on campus. The 
eatery also switched to a pay-peritem system. Forced to compete with 
other venues and hurt by its east end 
campus location, Highlander record
ed a loss of approximately $700,000 
in its final year of operation.
Binstock believes that the free mar

shut down. A final decision has not 
yet been made on the future of

The fraternities have a lot more 
leeway, but if the sororities threw 
parties like the fraternities did, peo
ple would be much quicker to judge 
us, said Palechak.
The fraternities, however, have 
not avoided the scrutiny of the cam
pus with their behavior as of late.
The fraternities just seem like a 
place to go party every week and 
once in a while, they will do a com
munity service act to justify their 
existence to the rest of the world, 
said Ryan Marsh, a senior physics 
major.
When asked if Marsh felt that
past month made such plans moot.
Information about Schatz dining 
options for the fall semester was funneled through the Resident 
Assistants to all students living in 
campus housing, according to Neal 
Binstock, assistant vice president of 
Carnegie Mellon business services. 
Binstock said the Student Dormitory 
Council (SDC) food committee vol
unteered to take on the task.
Neil Hunt, chairperson of the SDC 
food committee, disagrees.
SDC food committee is not 
responsible for advertising Schatz 
AYCTE, said Hunt. We did go 
around the freshmen dorms telling 
them about dinner on Tuesday 
nights, but we didnt discuss that 
with Dining beforehand.
Before the start of AYCTE dinners 
at Schatz last semester, SDC distrib
uted one-time emails promoting the 
buffet for RAs to disseminate 
amongst residents. There was no 
agreement with Dining Services to 
duplicate such a mailing this fall.
Hunt, who has spoken with Schatz 
AYCTE customers, found that many 
of them are members of Carnegie 
Mellon athletic teams and were told 
about the venue by their coaches. 
Word of mouth is one of the few ways 
information about the buffet has 
been spread.

According to Waziruddin, atten

At 6 pm on Tuesday, the Jewish

Its a solidarity rally in support of 
Israel and in support of peace, said 
David Terdiman, director of the 
Jewish University Center.
Hillel stands with Israel. Hillel 
does not support the killing of inno

Terdiman is expecting more than

The series will include Richard

business ventures are included on an unspecific list of prohibited 
materials.
No procedure exists to monitor student and faculty websites for 
potentially illegal material. Usually, Computing Services is alerted 
to questionable material via complaints from individuals both on 
and off campus.
Lerchey estimated that he has received six complaints about 
Touretzkys copy of the Reclaim Guide since January.
In general, the complaints that come in about Professor 
Touretzkys web page are more frequent and more consistent [than 
those for other University websites]. But even still, its not a large 
number, said Lerchey.
Lerchey said that Touretzkys copy of the explosives guide is not 
illegal, and that Computing Services will not ask him to remove or 
alter his site at this time.
I dont think it in any way encourages people to go blow up 
buildings, said Lerchey. It was pretty clear to me that there was 
not an intent to do harm. Its just instructions on how to build a 
bomb.
Lerchey recalled that several years ago, a group of students pub
lished pro-Nazi materials on their University-based websites. 
Because the sites did not encourage violence, they were permitted 
to stay up. We very rarely have to take down web pages, said 
Lerchey.
Philosophy Professor Peter Madsen said that the case of Sherman 
Austin and the subsequent rally of support for and against Internet 
censorship has been compounded by the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001.
There is a real tension between the perceived rights of the indi
vidual and the perceived rights of the community, said Madsen, 
who serves as the executive director of the CMU-based Center for 
the Advancement of Applied Ethics.
In the wake of terrorist attacks, there has been a shift in favor of 
the concerns and fears of the community. Touretzkys website chal
lenges that shift and asserts the free speech rights of the individual.
What Professor Touretzkys site does is place him squarely in the 
camp that says: This is cyber space. This is free space. And im 
going to prove that its so, said Madsen.
Some Austin supporters argue that prior to September 11, 2001, 
hmHosatsiHoaxpyl would not have been subjected to federal scrutiny 
and its author would not have been arrested under title 18, section 
842.
Things have changed, said Madsen. Some materials found 
online may seem to benefit terrorists, but of course, terrorists are 
probably already adept at what they do.
Madsen sees the current University web content policy as a gray 
area. He believes that administrators should respond to campus 
and community concerns about the availability of an explosives 
guide on a University website by setting up opportunities to debate 
the issue.
There are certain cases in which restrictions of freedom make 
sense. However, freedom is what this country is about, said 
Madsen. The more we restrict freedom of expression, the more the 
terrorists have won.

sign a death warrant as governor.
On the issue of health care, candi
dates Fisher and Rendell both support 
increases in the states prescription 
drug plans for the elderly.
Fisher has a variety of proposals to 
address the proliferation of medical 
malpractice suits, including one that 
requires malpractice suits to be tried in 
the county in which they occured, thus 
limiting venue shopping to gain 
greater settlements.
Morrill, has taken a much more 
aggressive position. He calls for statefunded universal health care that 
would be locally administered.
Morrill, Rendell, and Krawchuk have 
all stated that they support a womans 
right to choose and are opposed to any 
restrictions.
Candidate Fisher would approve the 
outlawing of abortion if the US 
Supreme Court were to reverse its 
stance on the issue. He prefers to make 
exceptions only in cases involving risks 
to the mothers life, rape, or incest.
The last day to register to vote in the 
gubernatorial election is October 7, and 
voting will take place on Tuesday, 
November 5.

Fisher has stated specifically that he 
would like to double the current trash 
fee of $2 per ton to $4.
Rendell has also called for a fee to be 
charged for trash haulers based on the 
per mile transportation of trash.
Libertarian Ken 
Krawchuk has 
proposed an end to 
parole for violent 
criminals and for 
an end to this 
insane war on 
drugs. 
the candidates appear in agreement.
Fisher, Morrill, and Krawchuk have 
all stated that they support the second 
amendment and believe that the best 
way to reduce crime is to enforce exist
ing laws.
Rendell, however, supports what is 
called one gun a month legislation 
that would limit Pennsylvanians hand
gun purchases to one per month. This 
law does not affect the sale of either 
long guns or shotguns. Ardo said, 
[Rendells] position will in no way 
threaten the rights of hunters, sports
men, and law-abiding citizens. The 
only proposal he supports is one gun a 
month legislation.
Fisher opposes such legislation, 
according to his press secretary, Kevin 
Harley.
Examining crime on the whole, 
Libertarian Ken Krawchuk has pro
posed an end to parole for violent crim
inals and for an end to this insane war 
on drugs.
Both major party candidates Fisher 
and Rendell have stated that they sup
port the death penalty and would make 
DNA testing available to those on death 
row.
Morrill has said that he is opposed to
ated progressive income tax law put 
into the State Constitution to allow for 
additional education funding, without 
putting the burden on working fami

Morrill previously served as execu
tive director of the Pennsylvania 
Consumer Action Network and has 
worked for a variety of organizations, 
including Pennsylvanias Campaign for 
Choice, a bi-partisan, pro-choice politi

Ken Krawchuk, the Libertarian can
didate for governor, does not believe 
any new funding of schools is neces
sary. Krawchuck ran for state represen

sought the libertarian nomination for

offers the potential for additional growth 
through dividends, which we've declared and 
paid each year for more than half a century. 
And while our current 6.25% interest rate 
is certainly attractive, its the power of taxdeferred growth and the promise of lifetime 
income that make TIAA such a sensible way 
to prepare for tomorrow.

of specific portions of seemingly

and uses ground-based telescopes to 
identify objects emitting the corre

obtained from the ground-based 
observatories is combined with data 
from the orbiting telescopes to pro
vide the complete picture about the 
object being studied.
Richard E. Griffiths, a 
professor of physics at 
CMU, and Rupert 
Croft, an assistant pro
fessor of physics, are 
conducting work on 
the exploration of the 
stars using telescopes 
and simulations.

areas of the electromagnetic (EM) 
spectrum can be tuned into to obtain 
images that provide more informa
tion about galactic objects than the 
visible light spectrum could ever 
provide.
X-ray astronomy is the newest 
area of the spectrum to be focused 
on by several observatory missions. 
Griffiths is one of the mission scien
tists involved with analyzing data 
from a multi-mirror x-ray observato
ry launched by the European Space 
Agency (ESA), called XMM-Newton.
XMM-Newton is not the only bil

that CMU is involved with. Griffiths 
also analyzes data from NASAs pre

Satellite observations are useless 
without collaboration from groundbased observatories. Most of these 
telescopes are located in places 
where the atmosphere is clear, calm, 
and dry, like the dormant volcano of 
Mauna Kea in Hawaii or South 
Africa. Because of the unique condi
tions present in the southern part of 
the continent, CMU has taken the 
opportunity of involving itself in the 
Southern African Large Telescope 
(SALT). Built just outside 
Sutherland, South Africa, SALT is a 
modified version of the HobbyEberly Telescope (HET) in Texas. Its 
simple design makes it cost a tenth of 
the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea 
but restricts the type of research it 
does to deep space observation. This 
allows the project to proceed with
out the hundreds of millions in fund

ly requires.
When most people think of 
physics, they picture large super-col
liders or electron microscopes. 
Perhaps the most overlooked area of 
physics is the study of the extrater
restrial objects: planets, stars, galax
ies, and even the entire universe; 
better known as astronomy. Many 
ancient civilizations have studied 
and even worshiped various objects 
of the heavens. Both the Mayans 
and Egyptians built their pyramidal 
structures to conform to exact astro
logical events. Modern society turns 
to astronomy to answer the ques
tions of why and how the universe 
formed. This branch of physics takes 
advantage of the theoretical and 
practical particle physics that we 
have enjoyed the benefits of for so 
many years and uses them to turn an 
eye to the sky.

report of an out-of-body experience. 
Until now, his had stood as the only 
reputable account of an out-of-body 
experience.
Blanke and his associates conclud
ed, It is possible that the experience 
of dissociation of self from the body is 
a result of failure to integrate com
plex somatosensory and vestibular 
information.
But as believers in the paranormal 
are quick to point out, the fact that
out-of-body experiences have been 
artificially elicited in isolated cases 
does not prove that it is the only way 
they could happen. Dr. Bruce 
Greyson, Director of the Division of 
Personality Studies at the University 
of Virginia Health System, used the 
analogy that although stimulating 
someones brain in a certain place 
might cause him or her to hear an 
orchestra playing, that does not 
mean that the same sound could 
never be made by an actual orches

Blanke reported that an electrical

caused her to feel that she was float

The woman, who was being treat
ed for epilepsy, underwent MRI 
(magnetic resonance imaging) scans, 
but they failed to identify the cause of 
her disease. Searching for the source 
of her seizures, researchers opened 
up her skull and inserted electrodes 
in various locations on the surface of 
the cortex. When they stimulated the 
right angular gyrus, located just 
behind the right ear, the woman at 
first said she was sinking into the 
bed and falling from a height.
Upon looking at her legs, she felt 
they were oddly shortened. With 
stronger stimulation to the same 
area, she reported, I see myself lying 
in bed, from above, but I only see my 
legs and lower trunk. The area was 
stimulated twice more, and she had 
the same experience both times.

Additionally, as volume approach
es its upward limit, sound quality 
decreases significantly, so an accept
able mix of quality and volume wont
be suitable for more than intimate 
gatherings around the Soundbug.
In fact, informal trials indicate that 
a single Soundbug creates hardly 
enough sound to have a satisfactory 
time watching a movie on a laptop 
with a group of as few as three, 
spread out ten feet from the speaker. 
Furthermore, the Soundbug fails dis
mally at replicating bass with any 
intensity.
The bottom line? Too bad for the 
Soundbug, whose aesthetic sheen 
and techno-flavor do not outweigh its 
poor sound, low volume, and overall 
lightweight feature set. This suck-on

looks are not worth its $35-plus

Music emanating from vibrating 
tables and windows is the novel sell
ing point of the Olympia Soundbug, a 
new portable music device from 
Wave Industries Ltd. The Soundbug 
is a new type of speaker that, when 
attached properly by suction, makes 
sound come from any smooth, hard, 
flat surface. It is sleekly designed, 
battery powered, and about the size 
of a thick mobile phone. A suction 
cup about an inch in diameter forms a 
partial vacuum when twisted onto a 
surface.
Your laptop speakers are probably 
just as bad as mine, which means 
they emit sound similar in volume 
and quality to a pair of headphones 
lying several feet away from your 
head. The Soundbug is designed to 
replace those speakers so that an 
audience can hear a presentation or 
listen to music.
The way the Soundbug works is 
actually pretty cool. The suction cup, 
called a sucker ring on the 
zzzxoynSTeng4noxpyl website, is 
made of a magnetostrictive (or magnetoelastic, if you prefer) material 
called Terfenol-D that expands and 
contracts at a very high frequency. 
The Soundbug transfers the force to 
the surface on which it has been 
attached, propagating vibrations and 
turning the entire surface into a 
sounding board.
The upshot is that to make the 
Soundbug work, you need to suck it 
onto an acceptable surface, and it 
makes that surface vibrate the air 
around it to create sound, much like a 
traditional speaker.

Dear Edward,
File sharing through Windows is 
easily configurable. It is less secure 
than the FTP transfer method 
known by many here, but it is much 
more convenient to use. It is less 
secure because if you do not log out 
of the remote computer, then any
body on that computer will have 
access to your files on your person
al home computer. You basically 
have full read and write access 
(depending on the administrative 
permissions set) to your personal 
home computers drives.
To set up file sharing, you need to 
have a username and password set 
on your personal home computer 
(server).
- To do this, go to Start Menu -> 
Control Panel -> Users
- Add a user or change your 
existing one.
Now to make folders shareable 
on your server computer, you 
need to be logged in with adminis
trative rights.
- Select the folder that you want 
to share.
- If you want to share your whole 
hard drive, you right click on your

Microsoft Games discusses 
the design of fun games
Joseph Traub, former SCS director, speaks on CS history
by Daniel Kim
-nSHyr famiizrHasr
With every seat taken, people 
were forced to sit on the stairs run
ning up and down the sides of Wean 
Hall 7500 as they eagerly awaited 
what turned out to be a grand story
telling session by one of early 
i shapers of the Computer Science 
department at Carnegie Mellon.
On Thursday, September 19, 
Joseph Traub, the head of the 
Computer Science department at 
CMU from 1971 to 1979 and current
ly the Edwin Armstrong Professor of 
Computer Science at Columbia 
University, returned to give a talk 
entitled, Computer Science at CMU: 
A Personal View.
Professors, faculty, and students
came to listen. And the free dough
nuts didnt hurt, either.
Traub related a series of anecdotes 
about the origins of CMUs computer 
science department.
He began by describing the ety
mology of the term Black Friday, a 
meeting held on Fridays where facul
ty would get together to evaluate stu
dents.
The next account was of The 
Famous Cheese Cooperative, one of 
the more memorable stories he told. 
In the early 70s, the faculty would 
have wine and cheese parties in the 
old lounge. This was the early days of 
email, and people started requesting 
cheeses by email.
It got to the point where they were 
cutting 3,000 pounds of cheese each 
meeting. At the time, CMU was 
receiving their computer resources
from ARPA (the Advanced Research 
Projects Agency), and they were 
afraid ARPA would find out they 
were using their valuable resources 
to fill out cheese orders.
Other topics discussed were the 
Alan J. Perlis memorial shaft, the 
tale of the geriatric robot, and, on a 
more serious note, the future of com
puter science.
Traub covered a wide variety of 
topics, but what didnt change 
throughout the talk was the easy
going, enthusiastic atmosphere that 
Traub created. At one point during 
the talk, a cell phone rang. If thats 
my wife, tell her Im not here. 
Actually, if thats my girlfriend, tell 
her my wife is not here! said Traub 
jokingly.
With so many great minds in the 
room, one might have expected a
more serious tone to the talk, but it 
was full of jokes and frequent inter
jections from the audience. One of 
the more frequent speakers was 
Joseph Newcomer, an adjunct senior 
systems scientist here at CMU.
I was here during Traubs entire 
tenure, the Traub Era. It was an 
amazing era. When Traub was here, 
that was the beginning of CMU 
becoming a major research facility. 
He created the powerhouse we know 
as computer science at CMU, said 
Newcomer.
When asked why he left Carnegie 
Mellon so early, when he was having 
so much fun, Traub said, I wanted to 
see if I could do at Columbia what I 
did at Carnegie Mellon.

Bill Fulton and Keith Stuery, of Microsoft Games, explained theories of user design 
in creating games that are fun and appeal to a large range of gamers.Astronomers use new telescopes to improve data on stars
by Jonathan Lee
-nSHyr famiizrHasr
Consumers have a staggering 
amount of video games to choose 
from. If a game is tedious, unoriginal, 
sluggish, or unaddictive, gamers buy 
a different one which is better  no 
big deal. For the $9.4 billion gaming 
industry, a lot is at stake when game 
players determine what is fun.
Bill Fulton and Keith Stuery from 
the User-Testing Group at Microsoft 
Games spoke at a lecture last 
Wednesday in Wean Hall 7500 host
ed by the Human Computer 
Interaction Institute (HCII) and the 
Entertainment Technology Center 
(ETC). Fulton and Stuery discussed 
how they quantify fun through dif
ferent human computer interaction 
methods such as controlled play-test
ing and psychological analysis.
Pretty much, there are 600 games
going out and 60 of them are making 
money.... If youre good at games, 
theres a lot of money to be made. If 
youre bad at games, theres a lot of 
money to be lost, said Fulton.
Unlike productivity software in 
which users wish to achieve a goal 
they already have in mind, games 
seek to create goals and enjoyable 
experiences. To help accomplish this 
task, the User-Testing Group con
ducts studies on gamer attitudes and 
behaviors through a program called 
Playtest.
During Playtest, 25-35 selected 
gamers from the Seattle area are 
given an hour with an upcoming 
game and are later asked to rate the 
quality of the game through openended questionnaires. In a market in 
which billions of dollars lie in the 
hands of whimsical gamers, the data 
obtained from such tests have proven 
invaluable to the Microsoft Games 
group.
SATELLITES, from page A6
| Taking current theoretical physics 
j and translating it into a working 
model of the known universe is the 
| ultimate goal. Considering that 
astronomers estimate the universe 
contains approximately 1090 parti
cles, the task is very daunting.
Croft is working on simulations of 
the universe from the Big Bang to the 
current state of the universe. Inputs 
for simulating the universe include 
radiation levels, the speed of light, 
and other universal constants, but 
resolution of the final model 
depends highly on available comput
ing power. Just like meteorologists 
predict the paths of hurricanes and 
tropical storms by sending planes 
inside to gather data, more informa
tion available to astronomers means 
better results in the final modeling of 
the universes evolution.
Some universities, the amount of 
computing power available to 
astronomy research is limited to 
Beowulf clusters, which are dozens 
of consumer-level PCs linked togeth
er to form a powerful parallel pro
cessing platform.
CMU involves both its graduate 
and undergraduate students in the 
maintenance of the physics depart
ment computing platforms. Right 
now, the resolution of modern 
models is about 300,000,000 light 
years for each pixel or particle. 
Considering that our galaxy is about 
100,000 light years across and that 
there are over 100 billion galaxies in 
the universe, this is quite impressive. 
New knowledge of physics is con
stantly added to the models to 
improve accuracy.
Theory and observation are sym
biotic in their relationship. Observed 
data (physical cosmology) is used to 
confirm or reject proposed theories 
about the behavior and formation of 
the universe.
Theory then dictates what obser
vations that astronomers might be 
interested in taking. Even after all 
the data gathered by telescopes, 
there is still a lot of uncertainty 
involved in the answers given by the 
model simulations.
In the end, the mysteries of the 
cosmological universe are unraveled 
a little bit every day. CMU plays its 
part in the international community 
of interstellar explorers that attempt 
to answer some of the most profound 
questions facing humanity. When 
you really want to know when the 
end is near, only an astronomer will 
be able to give you a straight answer.

CMU should act against drug-free 
provision of Higher Education Act
tory to federal law. Only four colleges have 
introduced policies contrary to the drug-free 
provision, most recendy Yale University. To 
recoup aid in succeeding years, the law 
requires an applicant to complete a rehabilita
tion program. Yale has promised to provide 
institutional aid to students who are convicted 
of using drugs, as opposed to selling, as long 
as they agree to undergo rehabilitation, which 
can be done through the schools health center 
at minimal cost.
Efforts are underway in Congress to repeal 
the reactionary drug-free amendment. House 
Resolution 786 has approximately 60 cospon
sors, but the law is not expected to pass, 
despite the lobbying efforts of several colle
giate student governments.
As far as CMU is concerned, only one stu
dent lost his financial aid due to the clause this 
year. But whether it be one case or one hun
dred, CMU should protect its students from 
unethical federal aferthoughts.
The federal government says there is only 
one crime for which it will deny a student 
financial assistance for higher education. If 
applicants answer yes to question 35 on the 
Free Application for Federal Student Aid 
(FAFSA)  confirming that they have had 
drug convictions on their records  they may 
lose nearly $15,000 in financial assistance.
The drug-free provision of the Higher 
Education Act, passed in 1998, will deny aid to 
30,000 students this year, according to statis
tics released by the Department of Education. 
The intrusion by the government into person
al choices is only part of the laws problem. 
The provision is also a barrier to social mobili
ty; it severely restricts the poor and lower 
classes access to education.
Carnegie Mellon administrators say the law 
has been a non-issue (only one student was 
denied aid for this school year), but students 
should be assured that their university will 
choose the ethical path, even when contradicBaseball clubs varsity aspirations

Leftist activists promote an unrealistic disaster
If activists ran the country, we would not see very many American 
flags or hear patriotic songs, and the word God would be forever 
stricken from the dictionary. The golden rule of thou shalt not 
offend anyone would reign supreme. At Berkeley, the nations 
hotbed for the acid-tripped radical left, organizers for the schools
9-11 anniversary ceremonies considered not playing America the 
Beautiful or even flying the American flag. They felt that some stu
dents might have a negative reaction to such symbols of our coun
try, and thus their views must be respected. A tyranny of the minor
ity solves this problem, the perfect example being the far-out rul
ing on the Pledge of Allegiance by the activism-infested 9th Circuit 
Court in California this summer. According to their moral rela
tivism, all views and opinions are equal and imposing your view is. 
a grave offense  unless, of course, it adds diversity. Yes, even the. 
perpetrators of the 9-11 attacks hold perfectly valid worldviews that' 
must be respected for their diversity. This ridiculous, nonjudgmenopponents they would be facing as a varsity 
squad. The team had hoped to compete in this 
years University Athletic Association (UAA) 
championship tournament. As a varsity squad, 
the team would ordinarily join all other CMU 
teams as a member of the UAA conference, but 
was refused entry to the tournament.
The request was denied by a consensus of 
the athletic directors from the other UAA 
schools. Among other reasons for exclusion, 
the directors cited the UAA champions auto
matic bid to the NCAA tournament. The NCAA 
does not recognize club teams, and therefore 
only varsity teams would be allowed to com
pete at the UAA championships. Ironically, the 
other directors argument turned out to be 
faulty  the UAA is one member short of the 
number required for the NCAA to extend an 
automatic bid.
Though it will not be competing in the tour
nament, the team was able to schedule the 
game at the University of Rochester, a member 
of the UAA. Club members are funding the trip 
to Rochester from their own pockets, a mea
sure which hopefully will not be necessary in 
the near future. The game will show recogni
tion of the clubs fight for varsity status by 
other members of the UAA, and allows the 
players to see how they match up with the 
competition they would regularly face.
Last year, the Carnegie Mellon baseball club 
sought to gain recognition as a varsity sports 
team. That process will take a well-deserved 
step forward when the team plays the 
University of Rochester on October 13.
The team has taken significant strides since 
it made the decision to vie for varsity status, 
and continues to gain support on campus. 
Attendance at games this season has been 
comparable to other CMU sports and, despite 
not being allowed to formally recruit high 
school students, the team has started attract
ing legitimate talent among the current firstyear class.
Finances represent the largest stumbling 
block to the clubs objectives. Although it 
pledges complete support for the clubs aims, 
the University requires that a $1 million start
up fund be raised for the baseball and softball 
clubs. The softball club would also receive var
sity status to ensure that CMU complies with 
Title IX regulations.
Baseball team members have succeeded in 
soliciting donations to help their cause, hold
ing several local fundraisers. Earlier this 
semester, the team controlled the Fence for 
several days to gain support from the student 
body.
Despite its present club status, the team is 
making progress in scheduling the types of

Another world economic summit, another round of protests. As 
the signs around Oakland state, all were welcome to come to 
Washington, D.C. last weekend, and literally help shut down the 
city, protest, or get on a soapbox over just about anything. The list 
includes environmental policies, capitalism, globalization, social 
justice, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, 
President Bush, war, feminism, and more. So what would happen if 
the wishes of the radical left came true? Be afraid, be very afraid.
If social justice activists ran the country, the minimum wage 
would be about $15 per hour. Ostensibly, this living wage is 
intended to help those barely making enough to eat. But any econ
omist will tell you that tripling the minimum wage will put vast 
numbers of those unskilled workers out of work because employers 
will no longer be able to afford to keep them. So the very people the 
proponents of the living wage are trying to help would be out of a 
job, and then everyone else would be worse off, because Big Macs 
would cost seven dollars each.
If radical environmental activists ran the country, electricity 
would cost many times what it does today because only wind and 
solar energy are environmentally friendly. Are these jobless activists 
ready for their electricity bills to go up 500 percent? No new power 
plants would be built, so our entire nation would end up on an end
less rolling blackout. Desperately needed infrastructure projects in 
third-world countries would also be scrapped because of potential 
environmental consequences. Sorry, they would say to some poor 
African nation, but you do not need this hydroelectric dam that 
will increase your energy production by 30 percent and employ 
2000 people. You might not think trees have feelings, but we do, 
even though we cant find your country on a map.
Activists are a very stubborn, uncompromising bunch, so any pol
icy that has potential negative consequences for anyone would be 
abandoned. For example, anti-war protesters staunchly opposed 
the removal of Afghanistans brutally repressive, terrorist-breeding 
regime, and they still would have opposed it if only a single Afghan 
civilian would have been injured. Defeating the Nazis unfortunate
ly harmed lots of civilians; if anti-war protesters ran the country, the 
Nazis would have succeeded in destroying the free world as terror
ists endeavor to do today. The US, finding this new, enlightened 
state, would become a punching bag for anyone who wanted to get 
some aggression out with impunity.
Activists are a very stubborn, uncompro
mising bunch, so any policy that has 
potential negative consequences for any 
one would be abandoned.
tal outlook is countenanced by powerful groups, such as the 
National Education Association. They would rather implement tol
erance programs in schools than concede that Arab extremists are 
responsible for murdering 3,000 Americans.
If anti-capitalists ran the country ... the name says it all. A quick 
cruise of the website of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence at 
zzzxmey,HotatsemSCxyrg reveals plenty of business-hating rhetoric. 
They fundamentally reject a social and economic system based on 
the private ownership of the means of production and exchange. If 
they were in charge, our great nations entire economic structure 
would be ripped down, and we would spend our lives waiting in 
lines for bread. I thought communism had proved itself inferior to 
capitalism, but apparently some people still will not concede this 
fact.
All it takes is a little brainstorming to see that the agendas radical 
activists advocate might sound flowery and enlightened in theory, 
but represent a grave threat to the fabric of America.

Knowledge Town aims to embrace college social scene
Suneal Chandran
You know, Ive come to realize  having 
spent some time in Pittsburgh and particu
larly hearing the briefings today, that while 
Pittsburgh used to be called Steel Town, 
you need to call it Knowledge Town.  And 
thus did President George Bush decree the 
establishment of Pittsburgh as a center of 
the information economy at Pitt last 
February. But is this city really a college 
town?
When I think of a college town, I think 
State College, and maybe Boston among big 
cities, not Pittsburgh, says Tim Renshaw, a 
sophomore IS major. Other than in Oakland, 
Squirrel Hill, and Shadyside, college stu
dents dont really create a presence. There 
are a few in the South Side and the Strip, 
but those are the places everyone in 
Pittsburgh goes to on weekends. Moreover, 
these areas, like the main shopping malls  
Ross Park and Monroeville  are only 
reachable by bus.
Philadelphia, by contrast, has much to do 
in University City, an area of town that the 
University of Pennsylvania and Drexel 
University share. From there, one can walk 
clear across town  through bustling 
Center City. Pittsburghs downtown, a tenminute bus ride on a day with light traffic, is 
deserted after working hours and is any
thing but bustling. Beyond Squirrel Hill at 
one point on Forbes and Pitts campus at 
another, there is nothing within walking 
distance.
Small towns with big state schools have 
another advantage  big sports programs, 
especially football. At Big Ten schools, foot
ball is as much a part of Saturday as church 
is of Sunday. Pitt, lacking a really competi
tive team and a stadium of its own, cannot 
match Happy Valley, where tailgaters from 
every corner of the state converge every 
weekend for Penn State games. Perhaps the 
Petersen Events Center will help change 
that, perhaps not.
Another problem is a little more subtle:

region. The schools are the ones that must 
persuade the students, and in this regard, 
the city should try to help them do every
thing to make the surrounding areas 
sparkle. One of Pittsburghs greatest selling 
points is that while it is large enough to have 
all the amenities expected of a major urban 
area, it is small enough to get familiar with 
rather quickly. Additionally, a few more 
clubs, theaters, and stores in Oakland 
wouldnt hurt. Developing downtown 
should also become a priority. The stadiums 
were supposed to spur an influx of new 
nightlife across the Roberto Clemente 
Bridge. We have yet to see it.
Pittsburgh may not he Boston or Philly, 
but it does have its advantages. While it may 
not have the dozens upon dozens of schools 
that other cities can claim, it has the right 
size and atmosphere to be a place where 
young people want to live and work. The key 
is to develop jobs, nightlife, and culture that 
will make them want to live here.
there simply is not a critical mass of colleges 
in Pittsburgh to give it an aura of youth and 
excitement. While small college towns like 
Ithaca, NY, or State College only require one 
major university and maybe a small college, 
large cities need a number of large research 
schools as well as several small liberal arts 
colleges for students to make their presence 
felt.
Increasingly, it is the research and innova
tion centers that Pitt and CMU create, not 
the academic, that are having an impact in 
the region and nationally. Pittsburgh is 
known for the Software Engineering 
Institute and the Robotics Center, and 
UPMC is one of the top research hospitals in 
the nation. These institutions are the ones 
that will drive southwestern Pennsylvanias 
economy in the 21st century, and most 
importantly, keep young people here.
So what can Pittsburgh do to attract stu
dents, and most importantly, keep them 
happy once they are here? First of all, 
prospective students are looking at campus
es and academics. They are focusing on the 
school itself, and dont necessarily have a lot 
of time to look around the entire city and

Legalizing marijuana will 
spur wide-scale benefits
Prev iovusW
The smoking of cannabis, even long term, is not harmful to health. It 
would be reasonable to judge cannabis as less of a threat than alcohol 
or tobacco.
 DmSpsa. British Medical journal, 11/14/98
For those of you who didnt tune in last week, not much was missed.
I spent the first half of the column being angry and the second half lay
ing down a rather fetid, statistically-heavy rant from which little light 
escaped. But not this time, kids.
Last week I focused mainly on marijuana as it relates to law enforce
ment agencies. This first point revolves mainly around the belief that 
cops have better things to do than harass and arrest citizens who 
choose to partake in a drug that, if nothing else, generally prohibits its 
user from committing any violent crime. Honestly, go take a few bong 
hits and tell me if youre up for knocking off a liquor store or stealing a 
car. Then explain to me why law enforcement personnel are made to 
come after you while hundreds of other people at that moment mrs. in 
fact, knocking off liquor stores and stealing cars.
Moving on, lets tackle the harms that arise from marijuana prohibi
tion. Users are forced into a clandestine market that raises not only the 
price of the drug, but the likelihood that someone will incur bodily 
harm somewhere during the transportation, distribution, sale, or usage 
that all illegal drugs follow. Right now, some twitchy shotgun-toting 
guy in eastern Kentucky is waiting for a DEA agent to round the corner 
and charge into his field, gun drawn and torch lit. Bang. Youre dead. 
For what; is there any good reason why a plant  a zssT  should 
facilitate violence?
Back in the 1920s, marijuana use was associated almost exclusively 
with African-Americans and Hispanics. For all non-history buffs, those 
werent the most popular demographics of the time. In response to 
growing recreational use of the drug, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics 
began issuing news bulletins claiming that a marijuana user becomes 
a fiend with savage or cave man tendencies. His sex desires are 
aroused and some of the most horrible crimes result. He hears light 
and sees sound. To get away from it, he suddenly becomes violent and 
may kill.
Even the AmotHSgayS Hlso editorialized that the fatal marihuana 
cigarette must be recognized as a deadly drug and American children 
must be protected against it. Not that the federal government, in an 
effort to misinform and manipulate the populous, would ever exert 
control over the media. Sorry, I need a moment here. I never thought I 
could write a sentence that would actually make me vomit on the key
board. '
Long story short, in two hearings totaling about one hour, Congress 
condemned marijuana use as a criminal act. Not long thereafter, the 
Ways and Means Committee submitted the Marihuana Tax Act. After 
a striking 90-second debate in the House and Senate, Roosevelt signed 
the act into law in 1937. The lone visible dissenter to this initiative was 
the American Medical Association, which stated, There is no evi
dence to suggest that marijuana use is dangerous. What do they know, 
anyway?
Yes, atHo is the BS that led to the formation of marijuana prohibition: 
a massive government-waged campaign meant to widen the social, eco
nomic, and cultural gap between whites and then-minoritie^. The sick 
part is, this crap has worked like a charm.
The Drug Reform Coordination Network reports that on any given 
day, more than one out of every three black males between ages 18-29 
are either incarcerated, on probation, on parole, or under warrant for 
arrest. Latinos? One in six. Whites? One in twenty. Drug-related 
charges constitute the largest annual grouping of criminal activity.

Nigerian woman faces stoning
On August 19, a Nigerian court upheld the decision to 
impose a sentence of death by stoning on Amina Lawal, a 
30-year-old Muslim woman. What crime did she commit to 
deserve such a barbaric and inhuman form of punishment? 
Having a child out of wedlock. This sentence of death is a 
terrible injustice and this gruesome act desperately needs 
to be prevented.
Lawal was originally sentenced to death on March 22, 
after she allegedly confessed to having had a child while 
divorced. Pregnancy outside of marriage constitutes suffi
cient evidence for a woman to be convicted of adultery, a 
crime punishable by death according to the new penal 
code for Muslims in Nigerias majority-Muslim northern 
states. This code is based on sharia, the system of law in 
strict adherence to the Quran. The man named as the 
father denied having sex with her, and this was enough for 
the charges against him to be dropped. Lawal, who did not 
have a lawyer when the sentence was passed, was unable 
to produce four witnesses as required under Islamic law, to 
support her claim that she had been lured into having sex 
with the man involved.
Lawals sentence violates both Nigerias constitution and 
international law. Nigerias constitution guarantees the 
right to life and freedom from torture and inhuman and 
degrading punishments. Stoning to death is a cruel form of 
torture prohibited by both the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against 
Torture, international treatises to which Nigeria is a party.
Lawal is the second woman to be sentenced to death by 
stoning under the new sharia-based penal code for 
Muslims. Last October, Safiya Hussaini, a 35-year-old 
mother of five, was found guilty of having sex with a mar
ried neighbor, and was sentenced to be buried up to her 
neck and stoned to death. Her sentence was overturned in 
March amidst intense international pressure, including a 
petition submitted by Amnesty International on her behalf, 
which included over 600,000 signatures.
Twelve of the 19 Muslim-majority states in northern
Nigeria have adopted sharia-based penal codes. With the 
extension of sharia law to criminal cases there has been an 
increasing number of people being sentenced to death, 
flogging, or amputation. These courts may fall short of 
international standards for a fair trial. For example, both 
Hussaini and Lawal did not have legal representation in 
their original trials when they were sentenced to death. 
The judges in sharia courts rarely receive adequate judicial 
training.
These courts also discriminate on the basis of gender. 
Under the Maliki school of thought, which dominates the 
interpretation of sharia in northern Nigeria, pregnancy is 
considered sufficient evidence to condemn a woman for 
zina, an offense which is to be read as adultery or volun
tary premarital sexual intercourse. The oath of the man 
denying having had sexual intercourse with the woman is 
often considered sufficient proof of innocence, unless four 
independent and reputable eyewitnesses declare his 
involvement in the act of voluntary sexual intercourse. 
According to Amnesty International, The clear implica
tion of this decision is that men violate and rape girls and 
women with impunity as long as they make sure that there 
are no witnesses of their crime. On the other hand, women 
and girls who are victims of rape or coercion have their sit
uation further compounded. They will be subjected to 
charges of zina and false accusation. This clearly violates 
womens rights, justice, and security while protecting 
those men who harass, molest, and rape women and girls. 
Additionally, there are concerns of discrimination based on 
social status, as those convicted are often from deprived 
backgrounds.
So often at CMU get caught up behind our computers or 
in our studios that we forget that were part of a much larg
er world. In the case of Amina Lawal we have the chance to 
help prevent an enormous injustice. Pressure from ordi
nary people around the world helped spare Safiya Hussaini 
from a gruesome death by stoning and this same pressure 
can help spare the life of Amina Lawal. Please take a few 
minutes to visit the Amnesty International website at 
zzzxmlSsoadnomxyrg and sign the letter to Nigerian Prime 
Minister Ambassador Jibril Muhammad Aminu, asking 
him to protect Amina Lawal from death by stoning.

Endangered species are treated like feces
RabyS MCT9hy
A ninety-day study by the US Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS) has deter
mined that the California state fish, 
the golden trout, may need protection 
under the Endangered Species Act 
(ESA). In the next year, a review will 
be conducted to determine whether 
the species should be classified as 
endangered or merely threatened. 
An endangered species faces extinc
tion within most or all of its natural 
territory range, while a threatened 
status means that the golden trout is 
likely to become endangered within 
the foreseeable future. That the gold
en trout is a state animal is what 
makes this event newsworthy  and 
outside the state of California, it is 
newsworthy only if there are extra 
column inches to fill. Many species 
quietly end their days because of a 
lack of interest or publicity concerning 
their peril.
Since its inception in 1973, the ESA 
has been responsible for the survival 
of more than 1,200 species in the US. 
Today, the FWS lists 496 species of 
animals and 735 species of plants as 
threatened or endangered, but recov
ery plans only exist for 266 of them. 
Much of the success of any species fac
ing extinction relies on the attitude of 
the public.
This is the tragic story of endan
gered species: the most photogenic
species are the most likely to be saved. 
Public support can transfer a species 
from the candidate list to the endan
gered list. The Sierra Clubs annual 
calendar is awash with mountain 
lions, wolves, bears, eagles, manatees, 
and whales. This is hardly their fault 
 a calendar with an endangered 
crustacean for every month of the 
year would hardly inspire people to 
make that extra ten-dollar donation.
Endangered species face enough 
opposition without having the ESA 
undermined, but that is exactly what 
is being proposed in Washington, D.C. 
Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, 
who has openly declared her opinion 
that the ESA is unconstitutional, has 
drafted legal opinions against the 
National Environmental Protection 
Act. Early last year, President Bush 
proposed giving discretionary power 
to Norton, which could result in many 
species being removed from the 
endangered list, or never being placed 
on the list at all. It wouldnt be species 
like the grizzly bear or the timber 
wolf, of course, so everyone ordering 
calendars from the Sierra Club can 
relax for the ------ TT'-1

In Pennsylvania, fourteen animals 
are listed as endangered, but the 
majority of public attention goes to 
the Canada lynx, and not to the 
orangefoot pimpleback, a member of 
the clam family in the branch known 
as pearlymussels. For every endan
gered animal that gains two minutes 
of coverage on the local news channel, 
there are forty others struggling in 
complete obscurity. As co-residents of 
this planet, we should pay more atten
tion to the world around us, and not 
allow plants and animals to be wiped 
out through our own careless attitude 
towards anything that does not pro
vide a good Kodak moment.

German chancellor defeats Bushs Iraq policy j Kiss my grass and lets smoke weed
David M. Anderson
The German people voted last week between three candi
dates: the incumbent, a challenger, and President Bushs Iraq 
policy. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeders coalition of Social 
Democrats and the Green Party of Germany narrowly won a 
majority in the German federal parliament, the Bundestag. Six 
weeks ago, this was an almost unimaginable proposition, as 
Germany has experienced a wide array of problems over the 
past four years. Schroeder was vulnerable to a challenge 
because of the uncertain German economic future and fears 
concerning terrorism.
Schroeders challenger, Edmund Stoiber, had run a strong 
campaign based on his experiences as the Prime Minister of the 
state of Bavaria. Unemployment there is 3.9 percent compared 
to a German national average of 9.6 percent. Bavaria, in the 
nine years that Stoiber has been in power, has outgrown the rest 
of the nation. The basic premise of Stoibers conservative cam
paign was that he was a superior economic manager to 
Schroeder. Stoiber dominated Schroeder on domestic issues, 
and polls from August showed a six point lead for Stoibers 
coalition.
If the issue was solely the economy, then Schroeder most like
ly would have lost. However, he was able to introduce a new ele
ment that gave his coalition momentum going into the election. 
He announced that if he was re-elected, the German govern
ment would oppose all forms of military action against Iraq by 
the United States. Instead of campaigning against Edmund 
Stoiber, he, in the last three weeks of the election, campaigned 
against George W. Bush, and won.
This is a potent case of public opinion about Iraq and the 
United States shaping the international system and constrain
ing Americas freedom of action. Now that Schroeder has been 
re-elected, his threat to remove German chemical warfare 
detection units from Kuwait most likely will be followed up in
order to maintain his credibility and the coalition he has in the 
Parliament. Additionally, Germany is host to a wide array of 
American bases, supply dumps and command posts that the 
United States would like to use if we are to invade Iraq. During 
Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the German government bent over 
backwards to aid the United States in moving troops and heavy 
equipment from its Bavarian garrisons to embarkation ports 
along the North Sea. It is unlikely that the same degree of coop
eration will emerge, because an overwhelming majority, 80 per
cent, of the German public opposes any German assistance to
Gerhard Schroeder was vulnerable to 
a challenge because of the uncertain 
German economic future and fears 
concernng terrorism.
an invasion of Iraq.
Germany is not the only country in Europe where domestic 
political forces are strongly aligned against any invasion of Iraq. 
It is only the most noticeable. However, the most interesting 
case could be the government of the United Kingdom. There are 
rumors circulating, as in ts ksz hsune,Hp. that Tony Blair, the 
Labor Prime Minister, and the American ambassador to the rest 
of the world, is being threatened by an internal party coup led 
by backbenchers who oppose any British involvement in an 
Iraqi invasion.
These foreign political machinations are vital to any 
American interest, however it may be construed. The Bush 
Administration should interpret that traditional American allies 
will not participate in naked and unconstrained aggression. 
This is an important and loud signal that the current adminis
tration needs to hear.

MARIJUANA, from page A9
Way to go, you Nazis.
Thats it. When it was written, the law had 
nothing to do with the chemical nature of the 
drug or its physical effect on people. Still doesnt. 
Does anyone doubt that the continuance of this 
prohibition is indicative of anything other than 
the governments desire to appear tough on 
crime while reminding its citizens who is in 
charge and ensuring this atavistic propagation of 
racially-influenced legislature?
Ok, Ill back off a little. One of the most widelyshouted claims about marijuana is its characteri
zation as a gateway drug. If marijuana is legal
ized, then whats next? We cant just start letting 
our citizens do whatever they want, can we? 
Surely your average country bumpkin isnt intel
lectually fit or well enough informed to make 
decisions about his/her health.
While picking around zzzxSyrl,xyrg. I found 
a few interesting factoids. In 1981, the University 
of Michigan Institute for Social Research said that 
Decriminalization has virtually no effect on 
either marijuana use or beliefs and related atti
tudes about marijuana among American youth 
where such policies have been enacted. The 
2000 ne,Hp vsm,at y,Hpd stated that those living 
under decriminalization laws consume mo lnpt 
yr ,soo marijuana than those living where posses
sion remains a criminal offense.
How is it that the public knows and accepts 
this, but the Fed doesnt? Granted, theyre busy 
bombing anybody with brown skin back to the 
stone age. But couldnt they take a few minutes to 
look over these figures? Virtually every study  
either independent or federally-commissioned  
has shown that legalizing marijuana would ease 
the strain on law enforcement agencies, slash
prison populations, free up billions of dollars in 
tax revenue, and even allow citizens to make 
healthy, informed decisions on their physical 
well-being.
One last thing that really irks me is the money 
to be made in all of this. Lets say the average 
semi-daily pot smoker spends $40 every week 6n 
weed. Thats over $2000 per person each year 
that isnt accounted for come tax time. Now, 
three percent of the adult population admittedly 
smokes marijuana habitually. You do the math. 
Alan Greenspan has and I doubt hes happy. That 
said, what about th big tobacco companies? 
Philip Morris has been bankrolling politicians for 
decades. You know theyve got contingency plans. 
In the event of legalization, theyd chop half their 
fields and start dancing like Johnny Weedseed all 
the way to the bank. Its a win-win situation. All 
parties involved, from the pot smoker to the ; 
economy to the politicians to big business, woqld 
benefit. Do the old rich white guys who run out 
country really hate black people and freedom this 
much?
Ah, this whole business just leaves me irritated 
and disheartened. All the rhetoric and statistical 
evidence in the world doesnt seem to do a lick of 
good. Our scientists, doctors, civic leaders, honest 
politicians, and general population have made a 
decision that, to this point, has been either 
ignored or shat on by the federal government. For 
now, we can only hope that one day soon, the 
worm will have turned, our country will have 
grown up a bit, and our national leaders will be 
ready to take the next logical step.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 30, 2002
Octobers here and 
so are the playoffs
ieuu kLsv
Amazingly, the National League West race ended 
up being tighter than the one in the American 
League. Fortunately for me, the Diamondbacks and 
Giants both finished things off on Saturday, win
ning to clinch the division title and Wild Card, 
respectively, and finalize the playoff match-ups in 
time for me to write about them.
The NL playoff teams have a few things in com
mon with their AL counterparts, which should make 
this one of the most competitive Octobers since the 
introduction of the four-team playoff system. Not 
only are each of the playoff teams clearly the cream 
of their respective leagues, but none of them is sig
nificantly better than any other. ESPNs Peter 
Gammons wrote a short piece over the weekend out
lining why each playoff team has a chance to win it 
all and every reason was legitimate. There isnt a 
single team lucky to be here, everyone has a shot.
Naturally, this makes predicting a champion that 
much harder, but thats what Im here for. First up is 
the Braves-Giants series, which is the only one of 
the four divisional series which Im even remotely 
confident about predicting: the Braves will win it 
going away.
In my season preview, I said [Greg] Maddux and 
[Tom] Glavine are rapidly sliding towards being 
merely average pitchers as well as implying that 
John Smoltz is injury-prone. Well, putting it mildly,
I was just a little bit off. Glavine racked up 18 wins 
with an ERA under three, Maddux added 16 Ws and 
led all Atlanta starters with a 2.62 ERA, and all 
Smoltz did was break the NL single-season record 
for saves (54 through Saturday).
The other main starters, Kevin Millwood and 
Damian Moss, both had single-digit loss totals, and 
the bullpen has been dominant all season, led by 
Smoltz and Chris Hammond, who recorded an 
amazing 0.95 ERA in 76 innings pitched.
Offensively, the Braves dont scare anyone as the 
team ranked no better than eighth in the league in 
runs, batting average, or on-base percentage, but 
the pitching staff is more than ready to pile up 
some 2-1 or 3-2 wins.
Atlantas first-round opponents counter with 
Barry Bonds. In a down year by recent standards, 
Bonds hit only 46 home runs with 110 RBIs to go 
with a league-leading .370 batting average and a 
major league record 198 walks (again, all stats 
through Saturday). Even more impressive is the fact 
that 63 of those walks were intentional, and of 
those 63,12 loaded the bases and 11 put the poten
tial tying or winning run on base (thanks to ESPNs 
Jayson Stark for compiling those numbers). No 
other single player ever had that much influence on 
how the opposing team approaches a game.
Unfortunately for the Giants, Bonds has never 
had a productive post-season, no matter how many 
regular season MVP awards hes given. Also trou
bling is that Benito Santiago, batting behind Bonds 
and getting all of his opportunities, managed just 74 
RBIs and a .278 batting average. Insiders say that 
Santiago has had a better season than his numbers 
suggest, but the Braves pitchers should have few, if 
any, qualms about avoiding Bonds all together.
On the other side of the ball, the Giants pitching 
staff trailed only Atlanta in ERA, but no individual 
has been able to dominate the way everyone in 
Atlanta has. The teams split the season series and 
both have played well in September, but the Braves 
have more pitching, a deeper line-up, and should 
win in four.
The final first-round series defies all attempts at 
prediction. On the one hand, I firmly believe that 
you never, under any circumstances, pick against a 
one-two combination as dominant as Randy 
Johnson and Curt Schilling. On the other hand, the 
rest of the Diamondbacks are banged up, and they 
are facing one of the most solid top-to-bottom line
ups in either league in St. Louis.
St. Louis is in no way intimidated by Schilling 
and Johnson, either. The Cardinals won the season 
series 4-2, losing once to Johnson, but not only 
beating Schilling twice, roughing him up for six 
runs on both occasions. And while the Cardinals 
may not have a single pitcher on the level of the big 
two (but, then again, who does?), their staff as a 
whole has a better ERA than that of the 
Diamondbacks.
A problem for Arizona in past years has been an 
offense that wasted great pitching performances 
with a complete lack of production. That hasnt 
been a problem this year; the Diamondbacks led 
the NL in runs scored. The loss of Craig Counsell 
and Luis Gonzalez to season-ending injuries opens 
some huge holes in that offense, however, and the 
Cardinals have shut down quite a few offenses this 
year.
For their part, the Cardinals finished second in 
the league in runs, 25 behind Arizona. More impor
tantly, neither team relied on a single player for 
production; only the Cardinals Albert Pujols ranked 
in the top five in any major offensive category. Still, 
the loss of Gonzalez will be felt in a series where 
every run will be critical. Its a hard call to make, 
but the pressure of repeating is a lot to bear; St. 
Louis wins in five.
Having knocked off Schilling and Johnson, the 
Cardinals will be completely unimpressed with 
whatever numbers Atlanta can throw at them. The 
Braves did win the season series 5-1, but all of the 
games were early in the season before the Cardinals 
gelled as a team and really picked up their level of 
play.
This series should feature more offense than any 
other playoff match-up, and the Cardinals are much 
better equipped to handle shootouts. Outside of the 
Joneses, Chipper and Andruw, the Braves havent 
had a consistent run producer, and the Vinny 
Castilla experiment at third has failed miserably.
Like every other series this October, this one will be 
close, with a good chance to go the distance.
Atlanta is due for a semi-annual World Series 
appearance, but the Cardinals will force them to 
wait at least one more year.
Going back to my pre-season picks, I had an AL 
team (the Yankees) winning it all. I dont see any 
reason to change that, especially with Oakland able 
to roll out three dominating starters and still give 
them some run support. For once, I dont think this 
one will go the distance, the Cardinals can win two 
and count themselves lucky.

Mens soccer defeats Bearcats, 
leaves Wash U. Bears heaving
jen uuners/rnoto taitor
The mens soccer team added two victories to its record this week, defeating St. Vincent early 
in the week and Washington University yesterday afternoon.
SOCCER, from page A14
The game was kept close in the first half, 
with the Tartans lone goal scored with 
three minutes remaining in the half. Junior 
midfielder Andy Sukenik crossed a ball in 
front of the goal, and when Saint Vincents 
goalkeeper, Sam Dukes moved to block a 
shot from the passes intended receiver, 
Chung leaped head-first netting the ball.
Chung was later denied on a similar play 
in the second half where the ball flew over
the goal.
A second chance for an insurance goal 
failed when a near own-goal for Saint 
Vincent hit off a Carnegie Mellon player.
Assistant coach Harry Uhrich attributed 
the narrow margin of victory against SVC 
to the Washington game. We might have 
been looking past [them], he said.
Carnegie Mellon next hosts the 
University of Chicago next Sunday. The 
Maroons are 6-2-0 after a 7-1 victory on 
Saturday.
Tartans beaten in first game 
with Johns Hopkins since 69

the ball on nearly every down with their 
1340 pounds of total weight.
Some members of the Tartans defense 
soldiered on, however, in what was an 
extremely dispiriting day for coach Terry 
Bodnars unit. Among them was senior 
nose guard Brian Smalley, who gamely 
added to last weeks impressive perfor
mance despite the athleticism and raw 
power of the Jays offensive linemen.
The lone Carnegie Mellon touchdown
came with 5:04 left in the third quarter 
when Highberger scored on a two-yard 
run and ended the Tartans only sus-'/i 
tained offensive drive of the game
It was a little mind-boggling, I guess, u 
you could say, the quarterback said,.' 
regarding the nerves he experienced 
being thrust into the catbird seat on a 
wild, and wildly disappointing day, for 
the Carnegie Mellon football team.
In the second half I felt like I got it . 
under control. But we just didnt get it 
done, said Highberger.
Whos Next: Franklin & Marshall 
College (3-1) versus Carnegie Mellon 
(2-2) at 2 pm, Saturday, October 5 on 
WRCT, 88.3 FM.
Last Meeting: Last season the Tartans 
routed the Diplomats 37-14. CMU leads 
the all-time series 17-6-1.
The Skinny: It didnt matter which unit 
was on the field Saturday in Baltimore. 
On defense, the Kilties couldnt tackle a 
quicker and elusive JHU team. On 
offense, the Tartans rushing attack man
aged a paltry 73 yards on 38 carries. And 
on special teams, Johns Hopkins nearly 
blocked three CMU punts.
Franklin & Marshall entered 2002 with 
19 losses in its last 20 games. After string
ing together three victories to open the 
season, things looked up for the dormant 
program, which even received three votes 
in the D-III coaches poll.
But last Saturdays clash with 
Centennial Conference foe Muhlenberg 
crashed the Diplomats wave. The Mules 
drubbed their Lancaster, PA opponent, 
68-22, in F&Ms 1,000 game in the pro
grams history.
Watch For: WR Justin Salton. Two years 
ago against the Tartans, the senior 
receiver caught 15 balls for 216 yards in 
his teams 16-14 defeat. This season, hes 
averaging eight catches for 108 yards per 
game. F&M will rely on its experienced 
passing game (Salton and QB Dave 
Makson are both seniors) since its rush
ing attack averages only 78 yards per ro. 
game and its placekicker, Dan 
Eggertsson has attempted  and missed
 his only field goal attempt from 19 
yards.
Senior defensive end Chris Gallino 
leads the team with 39 tackes and four 
sacks.
Result: A loss on Homecoming Weekend 
would be devastating. If the Tartans 
entered UAA competition at 2-3, not 
only would it mar the season as a disap
pointment, but it could also jeopardize 
Carnegie Mellons consecutive winning 
season streak (currently at 26). Franklin, ;y 
& Marshall may have a good passing 
attack, but the Kiltie ground game will 
return to form.
The Diplomats has an all-senior sec
ondary, but new QB Jarrod Highberger 
wont need to pass. Carnegie Mellon 18, 
Franklin & Marshall 16.
Team Notes: Placekicker Michael 
Palmer tore a right quadricep muscle on 
the opening kickoff against Johns 
Hopkins Saturday.
Head Coach Rich Lackner says Palmer 
is out for at least two weeks.
Quarterback Sebastian Smelko saw con
siderable time at the wide receiver posi
tion Saturday and will continue to play 
in that capacity.
I couldnt throw. I separated my shoul-L 
der last week but my ribs are fine, said; 
Smelko on Saturday.

remarkable number considering she 
only played in the back row.
The Tartans next opponent was 
Ohio Northern, whom they lost a 
tight five-game match to, 32-34, 
30-25, 21-30, 30-27, 5-15. The 
Tartans played tough defense, 
recording 115 digs in the match, but 
came up short in the final game. 
The Tartans fell behind early, 10-1, 
in game five, and could not recover.
We blew it in game five, we 
absolutely blew it, said Webb.
The Tartans were able to rebound 
from the loss to Ohio Northern and 
finish the tournament with a win, 
defeating Calvin 28-30, 30-28, 
30-17, 30-20, despite losing firstyear middle hitter Chrissy Bartek in 
the third game to a severe ankle 
sprain.
Laura Stover stepped in and 
played extremely well, helping 
Carnegie Mellon close out game 
three and win game four.
Laura Stover did a great job fill
ing in, said Roberts. I think it 
made the whole team step up our 
level of play.
The Tartans do not play this 
week, and the break should help 
them regroup.
We made more mental mistakes 
than anything else. We were picking 
up a lot of balls, and we had a lot of 
digs, but we just couldnt turn it 
around and finish it, said Schmidt. 
I think this two-week break will be 
really good for us, because it will let 
us have a rest mentally and physi
cally.
The team will be in action again 
October 12-13, when the second 
half of the UAA round robin will 
take place at Brandeis University. 
The first half of the UAA round 
robin was held earlier this season, 
where the Tartans finished 2-1. The 
Tartans cumulative record at these 
two round robins will determine 
their seeding in the UAA 
Championships, which they need to 
win if they want a seed in the NCAA 
tournament.
The volleyball team practices earlier this season. The Tartans have struggled in the last few weeks, lacking 
consistency. Still, they are ranked in the coaches poll and have a 13-7 record.
Living the football life
FOOTBALL, from page A14
columnist is down to earth, beer over liquor, fun over work, family 
over money. He is the epitome of toughness.
As other columnists debate about issues they cant affect, a point 
which they dont mind whining about, a football columnist looks 
this complicated world in the face and writes about a game. He 
writes to please people, not to make them realize how much things 
suck.
True, this column didnt focus too much on football this week, 
but I do have some things to say. First off, Randy Moss is too much 
of a challenge for Mike Tice and Minnesota. The Vikings need to 
trade him to a team with a tough coach, one that will whip this lad 
into shape. How can he justify pushing a traffic cop half a block in 
his car? Is he socially inept? How can he not see that that is a stu
pid thing to do? Randy is a liability, and until he gets some severe 
discipline in his career, and his life, he will never live up to his 
potential. That, and the fact Daunte Culpepper is not a good quar
terback, doesnt help Boss Moss improve his attitude.
Ill finish the football banter with some advice: go out with a 
really hot girl on Monday night. Take her to a fancy dinner, buy her 
flowers, give her a wink, flash her a smile, and give her a kiss 
thatll last her three days. This is the time to do it, score big for me, 
fellas. This Monday night the game is a joke. Denver will thrash 
Baltimore, who scores less than any given CS major at this school. 
So make plans with someone else, and reiterate how important 
they are to you as you are skipping a football game to go out with 
them (girls dig this sort of thing; it makes them feel all important 
and stuff). I know all of you will end up doing homework, but 
dont say I never gave you any good advice.
Just remember kids, anyone can pick up a thesaurus, imbibe 
some cheap liquor, and express their hatred for everything in their 
life in an eloquent and humorous column, but it takes real tough
ness to sit back and find the positive. Relax this week, enjoy a foot
ball game, enjoy a baseball game, enjoy a rousing game of chess, I 
dont care. Just be tough enough to put things aside, to rise up 
against the unfairness, ignorance, and downright nastiness of soci
ety and enjoy a game. To those of you who make a habit of whin
ing and complaining, suck it up.
To those of you who dont think life is good, suck it up. To those 
of you who hate your classes and have too much work, suck it up. 
To those of you who dont have the strength to be positive, suck it 
up. Be tough, tough like football.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 30, 2002
Maddox leads Steelers 
to victory in overtime
PITTSBURGH (AP)  Tommy 
Maddox, fittingly enough, signed 
with the Pittsburgh Steelers to be 
an insurance policy if something 
happened to Kordell Stewart.
Something happened Sunday 
and, because the Steelers had the 
insurance salesman-turned-backup quarterback around, they ral
lied to beat Cleveland 16-13 and 
avoid a possibly disastrous 0-3 
start.
-Maddox, the Broncos firstround draft choice in 1992, left 
football to run his Dallas insurance 
agencies from 1997-99, only to 
revive his career in the Arena 
League and the XFL. He was the 
MVP of the one and only XFL sea
son.
Maddox then signed with 
Pittsburgh, but didnt play a mean
ingful down all last season as 
Stewart was the Steelers MVP dur
ing a 13-3 season.
But with the Steelers down 13-6 
late in the fourth quarter Sunday, 
coach Bill Cowher turned to 
Maddox because he runs the no
huddle spread offense better than 
Stewart.
Its the offense Ive grown up 
in, Maddox said. In the XFL, we 
had four and five receivers all the 
time. It spreads the field out and it 
gets the defense out of what they 
want to do.
After being unable to defend the 
spread offense in confidence-shaking blowout losses to New England 
(30-14) and Oakland (30-17), the 
Steelers used the same system to 
win a game that seemed lost.
Maddox needed just over two 
minutes to drive the Steelers 77 
yards for the tying touchdown, his
10-yard pass to Plaxico Burress. 
After the Browns missed a possible 
game-winning field goal in over
time, Maddox led another scoring 
drive that ended with Todd 
Petersons decisive 31-yard field 
goal.
I look at it the same way as 
baseball  sometimes if a pitcher 
has a bad performance, you bring 
in a relief pitcher, Cowher said. 
To me, why cant football be the 
same? We know if we need a spark, 
we can go to Tommy.
It was a wild overtime, featuring 
two missed field goals  one by 
each team  and the second long 
drive in a matter of minutes by a 
Pittsburgh offense that was held to
two field goals until the final min
utes of regulation.
Pittsburgh's comeback prevent
ed a second 0-3 start in three sea
sons and also dealt Cleveland 
(2-2) its second bizarre loss in four 
weeks. Dwayne Rudd's infamous 
tossed helmet allowed Kansas City 
to kick a winning field goal on the 
final play of a 40-39 victory in the 
opening week.
The Steelers won the coin toss in 
overtime, but Maddox was inter
cepted by Andra Davis on first 
down, giving Cleveland the ball at 
the Pittsburgh 34. Three running 
plays netted only 7 yards, and Phil 
Dawson missed a 45-yard attempt 
wide left. Dawson had earlier 
made a pair of 28-yarders.
Still, Maddoxs comeback may 
not have been good enough for 
Maddox to replace Stewart as the 
starter.
Im leaning toward starting 
Kordell, Cowher said. If we need 
a lift, I will go to Tommy.
Maddox was diplomatic, saying 
he didnt want to benefit at 
Stewarts expense.
But he also said, I prepare 
myself every week to play like Im 
going to play every snap. I dont 
think what the situation is. I go in 
and try to be the best player I can 
be.
Still, Maddoxs effect on the 
Steelers offense was clearly visi
ble. After struggling to two field 
goals in 3 1/2 quarters with 
Stewart in charge, the Steelers 
went on two long scoring drives in 
barely half a quarter with Maddox 
in control.
He came in and picked us right 
up, Burress said. Tommy makes 
great throws and make the 
receivers job easier. Tommy was 
reading the blitzes and making 
great throws, and we were just 
catching the ball.
Stewart praised Maddox, too, 
but he isnt ready to give up his 
starting job.
Tommy came in and did an 
awesome job, said Stewart, who 
was 15 of 25 for 143 yards and an 
interception.
Im a team guy and as frustrat
ing as it was to sit there and not try 
to go out there and give it an 
opportunity to win, we needed a 
spark. But as far as I know, Im the 
starting quarterback of this foot
ball team.

Men place third at 
Duquesne Inv. meet
The mens and womens cross coun

stellar time also meant Carnegie 
Mellon had the highest spread 
amongst teammate times at 2:21.
The next meet for both squads is 
the Carnegie Mellon Invitational on 
October 12.

30 September 200? THE TARTAN Page Al4
With two goals from leading scorer 
James Steidel and another from 
returning midfielder Adam 
Hibshman, the mens soccer team 
kept its win streak alive against its 
first UAA opponent, Washington 
University (3-3-1), Sunday in Saint 
Louis.
The 3-1 win was the first game in 
three weeks for Hibshman, who has 
been out with an injury to his hamstring. Also returning for the game 
was forward Matt Crummy, who was 
out for two weeks with a groin injury.
Starting their conference schedule 
with a win was important to the 
, team, who was aware that 
Washington posed a threat none of 
their other opponents had.
Hibshman was the key factor par
ticipating both in his own goal 25 
minutes into the second half, as well 
as assisting on Steidels second goal 
late in the first.
Hibshman, out since the La Roche 
game in the first week of September, 
was enthusiastic about rejoining his 
teammates on the field.
We have a lot of talent this year, 
and I would hate to have to watch this 
team from the sidelines, he said.
Sophomore goalkeeper David 
Thomas was not able to continue his 
shutout streak. Washington scored 
the first goal against the Tartans this 
year when Washington forward Rob 
Weeks tapped in a crossing pass.
Earlier in the week, the team was 
able to continue their shutout streak 
with a 1-0 win over Saint Vincent 
College (3-3-1). Last weeks star, 
James Chung, scored the only goal in 
the victory.
Undefeated 
women tie 
with Bears
by Adam Greenberg
-nSHyr famiizrHasr
The womens soccer team had their 
win streak this season broken at 8 
games by a scoreless tie against 
Washington University (5-1-2). 
While Carnegie Mellon had 11 shots 
on goal to Washingtons eight, the 
team had only one shot in 30 minutes 
of overtime.
Senior goalkeeper Maya Nigrosh 
played the entire game and logged 
her seventh consecutive shutout and 
midfielders Melissa McMorrow and 
Ericka Anderson had four shots each. 
Washington needed to maintain 
physical contact in keeping the 
Tartans from scoring, fouling 11 
times in the game.
The Washington game marks the 
beginning of this seasons UAA sched
ule. Conference games provide a bet
ter metric for evaluating the teams 
success without invalidating the 
teams eight wins to date. The Bears 
are now 5-1-2 (0-0-1 in the confer
ence), and play another UAA game 
next weekend against Case Western 
Reserve.
On Monday, the team played at 
Hiram College (3-5-1) and won with 
Melissa McMorrow and Hallie 
Dumont scoring in the first half to 
give the Tartans an insurmountable 
lead against the Terriers, who have 
lost their last five games. Kristen 
Bevilaqua-Linn added another goal in 
the second half to complete the scor
ing in the 3-0 game.
The next game for the team is, 
Sunday morning against the; 
University of Chicago, another UAA 
rival. Chicago is 6-1 and will play! 
Wheaton College on Wednesday.

COLLN HOLLOWAY
Toughness. That is what its about. 
Toughness. The very essence of foot
ball screams toughness; it is grind it 
out, pound em down, beat em up 
toughness. Flat out testosterone-dri
ven toughness. But it extends beyond 
the field. Thats right, toughness is 
not only reserved for those who play 
football, but also for those who watch 
and write about it. A football colum
nist is a different breed of columnist. 
A football columnist is a blue-collar 
hero, the voice of the common man. 
With the vocabulary of an educated 
man, but the vernacular of a layman, 
the football columnist doesnt whine 
or complain. He doesnt point out 
problems to which he has no solu
tions. He doesnt bitch about unfair 
school officials. He doesnt care. He 
has a better approach to life. He 
merely predicts or offers solutions to 
problems at hand.
After reading a normal column in 
the paper, one may be better 
informed. Ill admit, my ramblings 
only appeal to probably ten to twenty 
people at this institution, only half of 
whom know I exist. But frankly, I 
dont care. I write because I love 
something, not because I hate every
thing. I write because I love the 
toughness of the game. I love the fact 
that on any given Sunday I can kick 
back with my ice-cold Corona in one 
hand, a bowl of popcorn within reach 
of the other, and not bother to think 
about how unfair life is. I love writing 
about a game, an escape from what 
is, according to other columnists, a 
harsh and truly unjust world (espe
cially for upper middle-class white 
kids). And yes, I love playing twohand touch, eating way too much, 
watching my team win, with the 
twins. I love quarterbacks in the dirt, 
pom-poms and short skirts, fans that 
dont quit, and ... and twins. So heres 
to football, the essence of toughness 
 what makes a sports writer feel 
like he too, despite his mere 150 
pounds of pure flab, is a man.
A football columnist is as tough as 
nails, as tough as the sport he writes 
about. He looks the world in the face, 
and he finds the positive. He will wel
come guests into his humble abode, 
bid them sit on his secondhand couch 
while he fetches them a refreshment 
before kicking off his muddy boots 
and resting his sun-burnt neck on the 
back of a pillow his kids made in pub
lic school home economics. All the 
while he is chatting about how good 
it is to just watch football. To watch 
the amazing plays, the team effort, 
the individual greatness, and the hits 
that one cant watch without saying, 
ooh, he felt that one. The football

Tartan men silence Bears 2-0 in first UAA game

Johns Hopkins Bluejays rout dysfunctional Tartans, 28-7
by Dain Pascocello
-nSHyr famiizrHasr
They may have played under cloudless skies 
Saturday in Baltimore, Maryland, but a dark 
pall has settled over the Carnegie Mellon foot
ball team (2-2) and shows little sign of disap
pearing. On a day when the reliable Tartans 
running game could muster just 73 total yards 
and one touchdown, the ugliness on the field 
was exceeded only by the pitiful display on the 
CMU sideline.
Following a fumble by quarterback Robb 
Finkey in the second quarter against the Johns 
Hopkins University Blue Jays, the Tartans sec
ond of the game, a shouting match ensued 
between the junior quarterback and offensive 
coordinator Rich Erdelyi as Finkey strode back 
to the CMU bench.
Said Finkey about the incident: He had a lit
tle profane language to say to me and I didnt 
take it too well and lost my head ... and we 
havent talked since.
After a few shoves between player and 
coach, the two were quickly separated. The 
exchange left Erdelyi and Finkey effectively 
quarantined from one another for the rest of 
the first half, and the game, with the offensive 
coordinator and running backs coach resum
ing his duties on the sideline and his QB stand
ing behind the players bench for much of the 
contests remainder.
The revolving door of quarterbacks contin
ued following the Erdelyi/Finkey scuffle, as 
red-shirted Jarrod Highberger saw action in his 
first Tartan game of the year.
With eight minutes left to play in the first 
half, Highberger impressed the crowd of 
Carnegie Mellon faithful who made the trip to
Homewood Field. Head coach Richard Lackner 
echoed the praise that others, players and fans 
alike, expressed following his QBs perfor
mance.
He [Highberger] played an excellent 
game, he said, and it looks like hes earned 
the opportunity to be a starting quarterback. 
Finkey, whom Highberger replaced, was equal
ly effusive about the young QB.
Jarrod Highberger had a very nice game 
today, and ... hes probably gonna be our guy 
for the rest of the season, said Finkey.
Highberger led the team in rushing and pass
ing yards with 25 and 131, respectively.
Highbergers highlights were not enough, 
however, to compensate for the Tartans porous 
defense which allowed 315 yards on 71 plays 
for the Blue Jays. JHU consistently burned 
CMU on the ground, amassing 236 total yards 
through a balanced rushing attack that
accounted for all but one of the Jays four TDs. 
Carnegie Mellon appeared confused and con
sistently out of position every time JHU quar
terback George Merrell scrambled with the 
football. The Blue Jays first touchdown of the 
game came, incidentally enough, off of a bust
ed play in which Merrell simply tucked the ball 
in and juked several Tartan defenders for the 
score. The 12-yard scurry was part of 31 total 
rushing yards for Merrell, and was his longest 
of the game.
Running back Adam Cook similarly pestered 
the Tartans on the ground with a 20-yard run 
late in the second quarter on his way to a 
touchdown and 75 yards rushing for the day. 
The Blue Jays front five created gaping holes 
for Cook and others in the JHU stable all day, 
muscling Carnegie Mellons defensive line off

Carnegie Mellons volleyball team 
traveled to Ohio this past weekend to 
participate in the Wittenburg 
Invitational tournament, where the 
Tartans finished 2-2 and are now 13-7 
on the season. The Tartans, ranked 
nineteenth in the latest NCAA Division 
III American Volleyball Coaches 
Association poll, still managed to place 
second in their bracket, despite their 
overall sub-par performance.
While the Tartans offense faltered 
at times, the team played tough 
defense to stay in games and give them 
a chance to win. Lauren Schmidt, a 
senior outside hitter for Carnegie 
Mellon, made the All-Tournament 
team despite hitting .220 on the week
end, far below her season average. 
Accolades and statistics, though, are 
not what the team is focused on.
We need to stop being worried 
about stats and stuff, and go back to 
playing volleyball and having fun, 
said senior outside hitter Dustyn 
Roberts.
The Tartans started the tournament 
Friday, losing to Franklin 30-18, 
25-30, 28-30, 30-28,12-15, in one of 
their closest matches of the season. 
The match was extremely frustrating 
for the Tartans, who made 16 service 
errors and 29 hitting errors, giving 
points away while they had to work for 
their own. The Tartans had their 
chance to win the match, when they 
were winning 10-5 in the decisive fifth 
game, but could not finish it. The 
Tigers outscored the Tartans 10-2 to 
win the game and the match.
It was very, very frustrating. I dont 
care if we win or lose, so long as we

play well, but we havent played well 
since our first tournament, said coach 
Julie Webb. We could not put the ball 
away, and it doesnt seem like any
thing has been clicking for us.
The second match of the tourna
ment was against Hope, who Carnegie 
Mellon lost to earlier this season. The 
Tartans came out ready to play this 
time, destroying Hope 30-20, 30-14, 
30-19. The Tartans served extremely 
well, and had 12 services aces in the 
match. Laura Graf added 21 digs, a

Chalking at CMU
Walking and chalking at the same time
Theres a splash of color on every sidewalk, a blur like 
umuHsr4lmpts on each corkboard. The campus is covered 
with chalking and postering from different organizations 
trying to get the word out. If you happen to fall into the 
habit of looking at the ground while you walk from cluster 
to dorm to classroom, then chalking breaks that monotony, 
making it the perfect way to get your attention.
I think chalking gives CMU more color, since it serious
ly lacks in that department, saidmathematical sciences 
junior Jay Wang.
There are announcements of parties, athletic meets, and 
student association meetings among the multitude of 
threads that are available at your feet. Other messages that 
get chalked over campus include birthday wishes, pi day 
enumerations, and ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO 
US, the infamous video-game-geek mantra.
I think there needs to be 
more postering and chalking 
on campus. 
 Eizan Miyamoto
There are guidelines to who, what, how, and where one 
can poster, chalk, or tag. The Student Senates poster poli
cy, S97-19, covers most aspects of postering, including size 
and the number of posters per bulletin board.
Active posters must advertize events that have not yet 
occurred, or that are ongoing. Each week a sweep of all the 
campus bulletin boards is made and all inactive or illegiti
mate posters are removed.
The Universitys policy on postering has been established 
to facilitate better communication through postering, as 
well as to prevent people from abusing the poster system, 
ensuring that everyone has equal access to bulletin boards.
Postering and chalking also expose students to some of 
the diversity that we have on our campus, from 
ScotchnSoda to Lunar Gala to Greek associations, and var
ious musical performance events from all different genres. 
Its a form of freedom of expression; maintaining the right 
of all different groups to use this medium is a great way for 
students to catch a glimpse of activities and different points 
of view.
However, there are also negative aspects to sidewalk 
chalking. On September 14, anti-government messages 
were chalked outside of Hunt Library and were listed in a 
Campus Police incident report as a terrorist threat. The 
messages were promptly removed from the sidewalk. 
Campus police must work to enforcing the Universitys poli
cies on free speech as well as take proper precautions due 
to heightened security following the events of 9-11.
Most messages do not contain negative connotations; 
rather, they are meant to improve the quality of life on cam
pus. Many students at CMU complain about the lack of 
happening things to do in the general vicinity of our cam
pus, even though there are numerous organizations and 
events for students to get involved in, so chalking is an 
effective way to spread information.
I think that there needs to be more postering and chalk
ing on campus, said fifth-year senior psychology major 
Eizan Miyamoto. I dont feel that I am aware of whats 
going on often enough.
Last weekend the rain washed the campus clean of any 
old chalk messages. However, a new set of events and posts 
will soon take their places.

Bread and Circuses
The importance of bread worldwide
Almost every religion, every culture, 
every region has specific foods that are 
a part of its tradition; not surprisingly, 
many of them are breads. Bread is 
regarded frequently as a symbol of life 
and growth, of warmth and comfort, 
thus it finds its place in culture world
wide. Some varieties are an important 
presence in everyday life, while others 
are reserved for special celebrations 
and holidays, but the significance is 
clear: throughout history, bread has 
been a hearthstone of human civiliza
tion.
In Greek Orthodox culture, 
the New Years Day feast is typically 
concluded with the sweet bread dish 
Vasilopita. According to legend, the 
charitable St. Basil asked the women in 
his village to bake bread with coins hid
den in the center. He would then give 
the bread to the needy citizens of the 
village, as a way of offering monetary 
help to them, without insulting their 
pride. This Vasilopita, or St. Basils 
Bread, is still baked with a coin in the 
center, and the one who is served the 
piece with the coin is considered to be 
blessed, and will be especially lucky 
during the upcoming year. A similar 
dish, with a decidedly Cajun twist, is the
Louisiana favorite, King Cake, a glazed cream cheese bread with a tiny plastic baby baked into 
the center.
Annausa bcnaeter/uopy btan
treats; a common delicacy is an anise- and orange-flavored bread, molded into shapes of 
angels and animals. This pan de los Muertos is not only enjoyed by the living, but offered as 
a sacrifice to the saints and spirits of the afterlife.
A staple of a traditional Jewish diet is the glossy braided egg-bread challah. Other 
unleavened breads, which do not rise when baked, hold a special significance within the reli
gion. A passage from Exodus 12:39 illustrates the freedom that such breads represent: They 
baked unleavened cakes out of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt. During the 
feast of Passover, Orthodox Jews allow only unleavened breads into the home; leavening tra
ditionally represents all that is unclean and evil, and by abstain
ing from it, one sends the message to the Lord that he or she is 
ready to be cleansed of sin.
In the Christian faith, bread and wine represent the body and 
blood of Christ; in fact, Catholics believe that during the sacra
ment of the Eucharist, bread is physically transformed into the 
actual body of Christ, and the name Bethlehem translates to 
house of bread. Because of this deep symbolic value, bread 
finds a place in many holiday feasts. For instance, Good Friday is 
traditionally celebrated with a batch of Hot Cross Buns, spicy, 
iced sticky buns with dried fruits and nuts. And Easter, the most important calendar holiday 
for Christians, has a menu that often features Crown Bread, a ring of dough into which five 
brightly colored eggs, contemporized symbols of the Resurrectionhave been baked.
Every year, on November 2, Mexico celebrates the Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead. 
On this eerie festival holiday, Mexicans invite their deceased relatives to return to the living 
world for a final visit. Like Halloween in the U.S., the Dia de los Muertos is replete with sweet
Some civilizations depend heavily on bread for basic sustenance. Ethiopian diet, for 
instance, consists largely of injera, a simple bread made of just a few ingredients. Since millet 
flour and honey are easily accessible, this thin, skillet-cooked bread makes a quick supplement 
for any meal. Usually, large stacks of it are served alongside lunch and dinner, and at the end 
of a meal, it is used to sop up the leftover stew.
Even America has its peculiar, regional favorites. Among the treats that bring annual wheat 
flour consumption up to 150 pounds per person are Boston brown bread, Southern johnnycakes, Amish friendship bread, and even Sunday morning waffles. All find a place in a distinct 
culture and speak for breads very prominent position in countless homes across the globe. A 
sheaf of wheat is a universal symbol of peace, and a loaf of bread speaks strongly for unity.

Social historian Howard Zinn lecturesMorris predicts UN response to Iraq
For two hours last Monday, Rangos Hall 
hosted the unorthodox and critical historical 
views of Howard Zinn, outspoken historian 
and best-selling author of j syu,so vHoayrd yi 
ts GSHasT famasox
The eloquent and witty lecturer presented 
to the audience a coherent mixture of autobio
graphical events that led the historian to his 
personal socio-political opinions.
Originally from a working-class back
ground, Zinn explained how he reached the 
theory stating that American society was, and 
is actually a class society.
The diversity and interaction of the audi
ence was fittingly unorthodox  Zinns lec
ture reflected the intellectual awareness of the 
campus community.
The historian was presented with questions 
ranging from evaluating the differences 
between the Republican and Democratic par
ties, to his own spirituality. After the 
bold lecture, a long line formed for the 
book-signing session, where Zinn took the 
time to personally speak with all who were 
interested in stating their personal views.
Zinns lecture promoted the essence of criti
cal thought and freedom of speech.
Former Clinton advisor Dick Morris pre
dicted last Tuesday to 200 people in 
McConomy Auditorium that not only would 
a US military invasion quickly defeat the 
Iraqi army, but that it would be welcomed 
by the countrys populace. Morris, whose 
lecture was arranged by student govern
ment, also said that an international coali
tion was not a prerequisite for US military 
action in Iraq.
Morris said that since no nation can uni
laterally act against US interests, the UN 
does provide broader powers to an interna
tional coalition. He cited past international 
agreement  even amongst enemies during 
World War II, the Vietnam War, and the 
Russian invasion of Afghanistan  on the 
use of biological and nuclear weapons. 
Regardless, Morris concluded that the UN 
will eventually support US action in Iraq.
If the UN did not exist, who would care 
what the president of France thinks? 
quipped Morris.
Morris also said that while he disagreed 
with all of President Bushs stances, he did 
think Bushs vision of issues in black and 
white makes him an ideal leader for a war 
on terrorism.

Morris also reflected upon former 
President Clintons legacy, comparing his 
status in history books to that of Grover 
Cleveland. Morris said people will see the 
Clinton era as a quaint, prosperous calm 
before a global effort to eradicate terrorism.
While lashing out at Bushs environmen
tal policies, Morris also criticized Gores 
decision to place global warming and his 
environmental positions on the back burner 
during the 2000 campaign. Morris also dis
cussed genetic engineering in human rela
tionships.

Anti-capital punishment advocates gather for panel in Pittsburgh
Last Friday, the Pittsburgh 
Chapter of the ACLU, Pennsylvania 
Abolitionists United Against the 
Death Penalty, and CMUs Chapter 
of Amnesty International sponsored 
a conference called Voices of 
Conscience: Activists, Families of 
Murder Victims, and Survivors of 
Death Row Speak Out Against the 
Death Penalty. A panel discussion 
was held, featuring speakers 
opposed to the death penalty.
Panelists explained the events 
that encouraged them to become 
anti-death penalty activists, and 
why they believe Pennsylvanias 
death penalty is racist, class-biased 
(more than 90 percent of its death 
row prisoners cannot afford attor
neys), and disproportionate com
pared to most of the countrys death 
rows.
Panelists included William 
Nieves, a former accused murderer 
who spent several years on death 
row; Pat Clark, a representative for 
groups such as Fellowship of 
Reconciliation; and Bud Welch, the 
parent of an Oklahoma City bomb
ing victim.
Each speaker had a story behind 
his or her perspective on the death 
penalty. A death row inmate victim
ized by police and prosecutorial 
misconduct, Nieves has a com
pelling reason to fight the death 
penalty. Clark represented several 
groups such as the Fellowship of 
Reconciliation and Murder Victims 
Families for Reconciliation, which 
seek to create restorative justice in 
lieu of the death penalty. Welch 
became an avid abolitionist after 
struggling with his daughters 
death in the Oklahoma City bomb
ing.
Nieves proved the judicial system 
is not flawless  it has sentenced 
innocent people to death. He was 
erroneously convicted of murder 
and spent six years on death row 
before being exonerated two years 
ago.
An eyewitness crack-cocaine user 
and prostitute had testified that she 
saw Nieves shoot Eric McAiley five 
times. Despite Nieves defense that
this witness had given two different 
descriptions of the murderer, the 
jury sentenced Nieves to death in 
1994.
While on death row, Nieves 
began to research his case and 
found that his attorney had misin
formed him. During the first trial, 
I had wanted to testify. However, 
my attorney had advised me against 
it and told me that if I testified, that 
they could use prior arrests to 
impeach my testimony. That advice 
was wrong, said Nieves.
He finally received a retrial in 
October of 2000 after finding that 
the prosecutor and police had with
held information from two witness
es that would exonerate Nieves.
After six years on death row, he 
was found innocent of all charges 
and finally reunited with his daugh
ter, who was two years old at the 
time of his first trial. There is no 
amount of money that you can give 
to the family of a defendant who is 
put to death in the name of justice, 
he said.
Through her work with the 
Murder Victims Families for 
Reconciliation, Clark focused on 
the family members of people who 
have been executed, recognizing 
that they too have been victimized 
by the situation.
Clark said that people often give 
responsibility to the criminals par
ents. Unfortunately for most of 
them, they dont get any empathy or 
sympathy, she said.
Clark explained that the death 
penalty does not affirm the life that 
was taken, but instead bears impli
cations for society. If our govern
ment can kill its citizens, then they 
can do anything to us because 
everything else seems somewhat 
more humane, she said.
Welch told the story of how he 
dealt with his daughter Julies 
death in the Oklahoma City bomb
ing. For months afterwards, Welch 
went to the bomb site every day and 
abused alcohol and cigarettes.
Although Welch once wanted
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols 
put to death, he finally realized the 
death penalty would only continue 
the cycle of hatred.
Revenge and retribution is 
exactly why my little girl is dead 
today, he said. To help reconcile 
Julies death, Welch finally realized 
that he needed to talk to McVeighs 
family. Welch was able to find com
mon ground with Timothys father, 
Bill and his sister, Jennifer.
I could see the love a father had 
for his son, despite what he had 
done, said Welch.
Each panelist had his or her own 
reason for fighting the death penal
ty, but all agreed on the need for 
government to support a moratori
um abolishing the death penalty. 
The fight will continue with a 
demonstration to halt executions 
held on October 23, at noon at the 
State Capitol in Harrisburg.

Inventing Van Gogh again
a literary perspective:andagain
It may be unfair to criticize 
1S9sSaHSg mS 7ygt. a new play at 
Pittsburgh City Theatre, for its fail
ure to give the good stuff one gets 
from more conventional theater 
(like well-developed plots and fully 
realized characters), just as it may 
be unfair to criticize Van Goghs 
paintings for their lack of subtlety. 
Why? Because playwright Steven 
Dietz is much more concerned with 
the language surrounding Van Gogh 
than the drama.
facile speeches to avoid having to work for 
what he wanted. Janelle Baker's two blonde 
paramours, bohemian Hallie (Patricks) and 
spoiled Marguerite (Van Goghs) were both 
strangled lifeless by Bakers overuse of her 
only tactic: intimidation.
Only Kelly Boulware  as the elusive 
painter himself  was able to breathe the 
creative spark into his eccentric fictional 
counterpart. Van Goghs speech, unlike the 
others identical academic prattle, was writ
ten with his foreign birth and unconvention
al personality in mind. It calmly wanders 
through the play, full of curiosity, setting 
dull rhetoric on its ear. But even such a suc
cessful mesh of playwrights imagination 
and actors intuition could not flesh out such 
a stringy, dull production.
Rand Ryans lighting shares Van Goghs 
homeopathy-induced obsession with the 
color yellow. Rendering a flat interpretation 
of the famous Provence light and lending 
harsh substance to all manner of fantasy, it 
lightly saturates the space with dull flavor. 
Lorraine Venbergs costume design treats 
the characters lightly, in soft, solid lines, like 
Van Goghs quick paintings. Joe Pinos 
haunting sound design incorporates lissome 
Impressionist piano, with transitions beauti
fully marked by jarring metallic punctua
tion.
Ann Mundells set, doubling as both a
JC Schisler / Pittsburgh City Theatre
19th century French farmhouse and a dilap
idated American warehouse, contains none 
of the color Van Gogh slathered onto the 
walls of the real Yellow House he shared 
with Gauguin in Provence. Its washed-out 
green-blue-greys contrast starkly with the 
rich-hued Van Gogh mock-ups that are 
pulled from behind tables and chairs during 
the course of the show. The cluttered yet 
ascetic space should work like a blank can
vas, instead of reflecting energy and possi
bility. However, the space bears the same 
monotonous texture as much as the writing, 
absorbing all thought of color from lighting 
and props, turning almost every facet of the 
production its selfsame hard grey.
Dietz enjoys the privilege of waxing philo
sophical and poetic about art when he 
should be fleshing out the plays characters 
and images, finding their essence. Far from 
organic, the end result smells stale and over
ripe with clich. It is all matter and no spir
it, managing only to exaggerate the essen
tial and leave the obvious vague.
Art is the conjuring of absences, states 
Dietz through one of his characters. In this 
case the conjuring is absent instead.
If theatergoers are looking for a glimpse 
into the world through the eyes of a mad
man, this isnt it.
SvwbeHv zgwbeHdCo ixbpplrHxvr
1S9sSaHSg mS 7ygt plays like a 
compendium of quotations from Van 
Gogh scholars, critics, and the artist 
himself. Van Gogh was not only a 
prolific painter, but a prolific letterwriter, and Dietz uses this knowl
edge to full advantage. The script is 
best when the character Van Gogh 
speaks the real Van Goghs written 
words. Lines like, I think more than 
by sinew and bone, we are held 
together by color itself, strike with 
amazing clarity and truth in opposi
tion to the more cynical and mun
dane observations about art made 
by other characters.
Dietz weaves contemporary scenes with those set in Van Goghs era. The play does not move 
chronologicallyinstead repeated motifs, like the small birds nests Van Gogh collects as pres
ents for his nephew, bind together the work. However, stylistic touches sacrifice the plays for
ward thrust and tension.
1S9sSaHSg mS 7ygt is not for those who love theater, but for those who love art and dont 
mind theater. This play is less a play than it is the best damn Van Gogh lesson youll ever have. 
Its full of rich anecdotes and valid criticism. In addition to the handsome, wonder-struck Van 
Gogh, and the lascivious, drunken Paul Gauguin, 1S9sSaHSg mS 7ygt comes with its own pas
sionate professor at the height of his tweedy, white-haired glory. You could learn a lot, even if 
you dont achieve tragic catharsis.
SbrgwTe wwHgxxo steHgr hxbpplrHxvr
a theatrical perspective:
Madness can foster greatness and destroy 
legends, but only sanity can bore one to death.
Playwright Steven Dietz said that every
thing is serious, and ridiculous as well, in his 
new play, a historical fantasy that drags its 
audience bass-ackwards through a dry maze 
of rhetoric on an artist's search for Vincent 
Van Gogh.
1S9sSaHSg mS 7ygt premiered at the City 
Theatre on the South Side on September 19. 
Tracy Brigden, City Theatre's recentlyappointed Artistic Director, is on a mission to 
develop and propagate new plays, and mS 
7ygt has certainly been eagerly anticipated.
Dietz has already achieved the recognition 
few playwrights garner in a lifetime for such 
familiar works as DySs,d ,mSsa. rH9mas dso. 
and his adaptation of 6rmpn,mx
The dialogue in mS 7ygt sounds as tinny 
and hackneyed as Dietzs other plays, and 
switching dreamily back and forth between 
periods adds to the play's lack of structure. 
Imperceptible, bland direction by Neel Keller 
adds neither depth nor clarity.
In addition to their sterile and two-dimen
sional roles, the actors themselves left much 
to be desired. Martin Giles as art critic Rene 
Bouchard hid, glib and fulsome, behind his

TH6T6VStudent cabaret to be a regular feature
In an attempt to bring more of the CMU community 
into the Purnell Center, the School of Drama is trying 
out a new concept. A cabaret series, entitled Final 
Fridays, has been introduced to bring students, facul
ty, staff and other members of the Pittsburgh commu
nity inside its doors and show the artistic depth that 
exists within Purnell.
Michael Olich, associate head of the School of 
Drama, has spent the past year doing everything he 
can to coordinate this production and make it a suc
cess. With the help of 
Gary Kline, the musical 
director, the two put 
together a program last 
Friday in the Purnell 
Centers John Wells Video 
Studio that left the audi
ence wanting more. The 
junior musical theater 
students performed in 
Fridays show, sharing 
their talents with the pub
lic.
In this first cabaret show, the performers brought 
the work of Jacques Brel back to life. Brel was a 
Belgian singer, songwriter, and poet who lived in Paris 
whose songs, which have become timeless, are about 
the lives of those who listen to them  his audience.
All performed magnificently, with highlights rang
ing from Megan Hilty singing If You Go Away to 
Alexandra Fridell with her rendition of Funeral 
Tango. The two remarkably personified their roles

music and not the production value.

performers.
and, with their rich voices, were able to create a per
fect fit for their accompanying song.
However, the cabaret was at its best when more 
than one performer was on stage and they interacted 
with the audience. JD Goldblatt alongside Jonathan 
Monk in Bachelors Dance decided to play with an
audience member to see which of them would have 
the pleasure of marrying her. This contact with the 
viewers made everyone feel part of the show, much in 
the same way that they could feel about the rest of the 
happenings at Purnell.
The John Wells Video Studio was the perfect loca
tion for the sort of intimacy that a cabaret show like 
this one demands.
It could have been put in the large Chosky 
Theater, said Olich. However, it would not have had 
the same dynamic relationship between the artists 
and the audience. This program is entirely about the 
music, and not the production value.
In fact, the setting was created with only one crew 
member, done in two hours the night before. The sim
ple staging added to the effectiveness of the show. 
The audience was able to concentrate more on what 
was being said and heard than on what was seen.
I was impressed by the performers ability to com
municate individually and as an ensemble, said firstyear musical theater major, Michael Stassheim.
This was simply a labor of love, said junior drama 
major Matthew Scott at the end of the show.

MacHomer: one performance, one man, 50 voices
What could a famous 17th century playwright 
possibly have in common with an (in) famous 20th 
century pop culture icon? Apparently, everything. 
Written and performed by Rick Miller, wmpvylsr 
features all the depth and twisty-curvy plotlines 
that made Shakespeare a hit 400 years ago in glori
ous combination with everyones favorite animated 
dysfunctional family, i he Simpsons.
An aural sensation, Miller provides his audience 
with over 50 voices from the cartoon series, includ
ing many less famous characters such as 
Bumblebee Man, Professor Frink, and Lionel Hutz. 
The show also features some curious, yet hilarious 
cameos, such as when OJ shows up to support his 
fellow Simpson in his time of need.
This one-man show follows the story of Macbeth 
pretty well, although soliloquies and a good chunk 
of the script were sacrificed  the whole show 
came in at just over one hour. Miller updates the 
story with a slew of curious anachronisms, paro
dies, and one-liners thrown in just for fun, and
stays true to the characters of ts fHluoySox 
Disciples of both creations are likely to be pleased 
with this unique fusion.
As with all things, this show does have its down
side, which, simply put, is its length. The briefness 
of the production made for some disappointed the
atergoers, wondering if it was all worth it.
Still, wmpvylsr is a good show and very worthy 
of attention. Its unique blend of a timeless classic 
with pop culture leads to hilarity fit for a Thane.

Smith ranges from silly to pained
At least one man overheard at the opening gala 
for Patti Smiths Strange Messenger show wasnt 
aware of the artists celebrity. Who is this lady, 
anyway? he asked his friend, while standing in 
front of South Tower Cross Section Gold, one of 
Smiths depictions of the World Trade Center after 
the terrorist attacks. As a reply, the friend hummed 
a few bars of Because the Night, a song Smith co
wrote with Bruce Springsteen. Oh, that lady, the 
man realized, she should have stuck to her day 
job.
Indeed, Smiths current work, which consists 
only of repeated silk screens of the South Tower 
that clearly allude to a familiar illustration of The 
Tower of Babel, rely heavily on texts printed on the 
walls of the gallery and displayed on tables under 
glass for their impact. The texts, including quotes 
from The Lost Book of the Essene, Smiths diary 
entries about the aftermath of the attacks, and 
some yellowed, handwritten pages labeled accom
panying text for ts :HSgTyl yi 7yT Ho AHatHS ^yn.W 
all gesture toward the mystic vision of the world
many claim was glimpsed by Christ and by Smiths 
favorite poets, Arthur Rimbaud and Antonin 
Artaud. The gesture is tantalizing, and its regret
table that Smith seems incapable of actually trans
mitting in her art the vision of the poets and great 
teachers whom she references.
Smiths student work, color-penciled cartoons of 
silly people with engorged genitals, comes across as 
much less burdened. Its especially interesting to 
see her early treatment of religion, including the 
Virgin Mother drawn to resemble a fat Russian nesting-doll in a 1968 work simply titled Mary that 
features a scrawl reading, Oh no, is that Roly Poly, 
Jesus mother? Also of note is a reference to Allah 
in a bit of verse-text on 1973s All the Hipsters go to 
Heaven, that appears next to a collage-clipping of 
Jim Morrison on stage. A prophetic word from a 
strange messenger? Either way, it does look really 
cool.

Butcosks bright color photographs of people

rest, muscles relaxed, eyes closed, features 
limp, mind apparently freed from the burden of 
thought  save the knowledge that they are 
posing for a photograph.
Butcosk used a special development process

ors stand out against their pale backgrounds. 
Every stray hair, every blemish and defect on 
the faces of his sleepers is clearly visible, lend
ing the exhibit a new degree of honesty.
Its about vulnerability. There is no other 
time in your day-to-day experience when you 
are as vulnerable as when you are sleeping, 
said Butcosk.
The artists intent was not lost on the audi
ence: Sleeping people ... were presented in 
such a way that communicated a common 
sense of purpose, said Drew Pavelchak, a sen

High cm Rebellion: Patti Smith plays Byham Theater
Patti Smith, New Yorks punk rock princess, accomplished artist, and talented 
musician opened a Saturday night concert at Pittsburghs Byham .Theatre to a diverse,

19, and the birth of her friends daughter September 25. [In] the span often days weve had 
death, life, and art  I think [my mother] would approve, Smith said at the opening of the 
concert.
Accompanied by two acoustic guitarists, an electric bassist, and a drummer, Smith 
launched into the concert with fervor and passion. Her set, consisting of a large screen dis
playing a series of psychedelic images and poetry, was obviously inspired by her belated 
friend Andy Warhol. Warhol employed a similar set design while managing the Velvet 
Underground.
The tragic events of September 11 deeply affected Smith, and the despair and hope
were reflected in her performance. Ten minutes of the performance was dedicated to a com
memorative film of ground zero filmed two days after the attacks. The background music, 
Les Nuits DEte, is the music she listened to while creating the art for an exhibit currently 
on display at the Warhol Museum. Between songs Smith read entries from her journal writ
ten in the wake of September 11. Referring to the event as the twin deaths, she related her 
profound sadness to the audience. The skin of our sky is wounded.
Smiths set was predominately acoustic, but she did manage to mix in some louder songs. 
My mother would not have approved of this evenings event because she liked the electric 
stuff, she said. With that, she performed a particularly rowdy version of Dancing 
Barefoot, after which a fan screamed, You still rock! The concert closed with some origi
nal poetry, a final enthusiastic song, and a quote. We are still the children of Babel, speak
ing in divided tongues.

Soulfly: fusion of metal and Brazilian roots
In the summer of 1996, my definitions of hard rock, heavy metal, and music in general were 
altered. As a boy, I listened to Roberto Carlos, Sergio Mendes and other examples of my moth
ers native Brazillian culture and music. But, growing up in North America, it wasnt long until 
I discovered Guns n Roses and Led Zeppelin. Still, I always saw metal as a by-product of 
Anglo culture. This all changed with Sepultura.
Until 96, Sepultura were the darlings of the Brazillian heavy music community, a solid 
extreme metal band. But with the release of hyyao. Sepultura brought metal to its primal core, 
reducing it to its roots. The first track, Roots Bloody Roots (a nod to Black Sabbaths 
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, of course), was a thundering, bass-heavy call to the rest of the 
world that metal was in fact a global phenomenon. On that album, they recorded with the 
Xavantes tribe in the Amazon, they sang in Portuguese, they left behind the jackhammer 
drumming and made every beat count, and they conquered America and Europe. I truly 
believe that without Sepultura there would be no System of A Down on top of the pop charts 
today. Sepultura introduced the rest of us to the fusion of world music and heavy rock.
So, when Max Cavalera, the charismatic front-man,left shortly after hyyao. we knew he was 
on to even bigger things. In 98, he released his new project, fyn,i,dx Truly metal, Cavalera 
ventured further into this new genre he had created with songs Like Tribe, Bumba (a 
Portuguese term for a loud noise), Umabaraumba ( a tribute to , what else, soccer) and 
Quilombo ( a Brazillian folk hero who led the uprisal of slaves.) it is a major achievement, 
and hard to follow. A second album, Primitive, was released in 2000 to much anticipation. 
Also solid, but top heavy with guest stars, Primitive was good but not focused. In September 
of this year Cavalera returned with III, a clear and precise vision of the future of world 
metal.
Opening with Downstroy and Seek n Strike, the album provides a one-two punch that 
nearly knocks out the listener. Closer to the middle of the album, Brasil (sung in 
Portuguese) is a call to arms to those in the favelas to rise up against injustice and tear up the 
structure that keeps them in the grip of poverty. One Nation is a similar call to the rest of 
us to transform our world into a place of peace and justice. Tree of Pain follows and is a spir
itual account of the loss of loved ones. It features a lovely, yet pained voice in Asha Rabouin, 
who worked with the band on Primitive. My pain, is as deep as my roots she begins as she 
soon trades off lines with Max. Also appearing with Cavalera in this song is his stepson 
Ritchie. The next song on the album is touching as well; the one minute of silence of 9-11- 
01 shows that the deepest sentiments can be felt without hearing a word. Soulfly III con
tinues the tradition of having a backyard acoustic jam in Cavaleras second home in Arizona.
The penultimate song is Sangue de Bairro (Blood of the Bairro), a cover of the Brazillian 
band Chico Science which tells the story of a Brazillian Robin Hood type gang from the 1930s 
who were caught and executed. Ending the album is the absolutely beautiful Zumbi, a trib
ute to the warrior of the same name, which is traditional-type Brazillian instrumental music. 
Like real samba, I guess, if youve heard it, youll know what I mean. But, as the song winds
down, wind chimes are heard in the background, and if you close your eyes, you can smell the 
air and the sugar cane, you can feel the mist from the waterfalls, and you can see the large 
sunflowers. To me, no piece of music has evoked such nostalgia as these final few minutes. It 
is in fact worth the price of the album alone. One of the best albums of the year. Period.
Please go see this band tonight at Metropol. Tickets are $20 at the door.
Until next time,
Alberto

Radio Cure: I am Trying to Break Your Heart
1 ml rdHSg ay 0rsmC ^ynr vsmra is a perfect visual and narrative version of the band Wilcos 
music. Fueled by a rough, minimal, Midwestern energy in Chicago, it conveys internal drama. 
Lacking the chaos of drug-addled documentaries about the lives of rock stars, magazine pho
tographer Sam Jones film is the story of critics darlings temporarily crushed by the Man  
and themselves. Even from the beginnings of its promotion, vsmra is presented as a 21st cen
tury 6ySa DyyC 0mpC. D.A. Pennebakers 1967 documentary covering Bob Dylans 1965 tour of 
England. That film, however, comes before the days of rock documentaries, before concert 
films were expected from bands in the visual range of most music critics.
It is clear that Jones would like to avoid the mas
sive empire of rock star cinema. Without knowl
edge of the ensuing drama, Jones intended to 
cover the recording of a seminal rock band more 
interested in its music than its persona. In making 
^mSCss vyas, %y$arya. Wilco set out to make its best 
and most experimental record yet. Their music 
uses the lexicon of country rock (lead singer Jeff 
Tweedy founded the No Depression movement 
with the band Uncle Tupelo in Belleville, IL in the 
late 80s) but branches far beyond it with multifac
eted composition and integration of many instruments not commonly used in the genre.
Sam Jones wants us to feel dissonance, from the bleakness of the Chicago winter to the 
inclusion of jarring background noises, and not for lack of confidence in the dissonance of his 
subject matter. What starts as the filming of a smooth journey featuring bandmates who know 
each other well quickly becomes the slightly melodramatic story of a bitter falling out, with a 
creative happy ending. What starts as banter between Tweedy and plucky guitarist Jay Bennett 
quickly becomes rancor over creative differences and the high cost of studio production. 
Tweedy mocks Bennetts conventional ideas, while Bennetts egoism makes him an unsympa
thetic character. After several vicious arguments, Tweedys violent migraines, and a perform
ance in Minneapolis where Tweedy thanks the audience for absolutely nothing, Bennett is 
fired. The film audience at Fridays Harris Theatre screening laughed aloud when Bennett pro
posed Tweedys jealousy of his songcraft.
Nevertheless, the band made a solemn, brilliant, and lovely album that went on to sell many 
copies and to be exalted by critics. However, it is violently disparaged and rejected by the 
bands once faithful record company. The Man is depicted by representative Bill 3ennett, who 
advocated Reprise Records dismissal of Wilco twenty-four hours after their submission. He 
even seems like an enemy to good music. He is stubborn and defensive and treats the name 
Wilco as a foreign word. The band is devastated. Rock critic David Bither of hy,,HSg faySs pro
poses what fans know: to a recording executive, Wilco defies categorization and is hardly mar
ketable. Several representatives of the bands parent company, Warner Brothers, express
shock over Reprise Records decision.
Eventually Reprise Records aid the band by drop
ping them from the label after paying for its produc
tion. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was quickly picked up by 
another, more appreciative Warner Brothers sub
sidiary, Nonesuch Records, which features an eclectic 
roster including Laurie Anderson, Henryk Grecki, 
and Steve Reich.
It is fortunate that Wilcos music is so interesting 
and that tension erupted, because the daily musicmaking activities of Wilco may simply have been interesting to admirers of the band and filmgoers interested explicitly in the production of pop music. The publicity-shy band members 
speak to each other with apparent discomfort while being filmed. The film is beautifully shot 
in a way that is not just eye-candy (though the credits-backing track of Gene Wilder singing a 
bit of music from btmr,Hs mST ats btypy,mas %mpayrd is unanticipated). Instead it is clear and 
gritty, though it is not uncommon when the object of focus blurs, sharpening the background. 
A shot of four band members backstage is so blurred it makes them appear to have pin-sized 
heads. The film is relaxing, moody, and contains seemingly benign elements that later turn 
into full-blown conundrums. Call it an eye cigarette.

Sweet Home Alabama is a so-so flick
In the new romantic comedy fzssa vyls j,memlm. Melanie 
Carmichael, played by Reese Witherspoon of Dsgm,,d 0,ySTs 
fame, has got it all  a gorgeous fianc, a thriving career, a 
charming apartment in Manhattan, and a cover 
on A magazine. Life for Melanie is great except 
for one thing: she has to return home so that her 
husband Jake can sign her divorce papers  and 
home is in the South. Melanie reluctantly makes 
the trip home, and during her time in a place 
that is both familiar and foreign to her, she 
comes face to face with a past she would rather 
forget.
j,memlm is, essentially, a romantic comedy 
that tries too hard to be romantic. The relation
ship between Jake and Melanie, haphazardly 
thrown together, seems contrived and unreal as 
the audience never really sees the motivations 
behind Melanies actions. In a scene where 
Melanie kisses Jake after having a heart-to-heart 
with a deceased pet, we are left wondering why 
she did it. Is it because of the sexual tension 
underlying their bickering? Or is it because he came and con
soled her? Nope. I think she did it because by the standards of 
most romantic movies, this is the point where our protagonists look into each others eyes, without speaking a word, 
and have their little moment. Our heroine is having a flash of 
realization; our hero is actually a great guy, and she is con
fused because she sees something 
in him now that she didnt before.
In addition to the unlikely 
romance between Jake and 
Melanie, I am dying to know 
exactly why Melanie is enjoying 
herself in her hometown. The 
people in the town are sarcastic 
to her, they treat her like some 
alien from the north, and 
Melanie is supposed to feel com
fortable? Nowhere in the movie 
do I see the townspeople gen
uinely nice to her, unless ganging 
up on her at the local bar and 
calling her stuck up is what they 
call Southern hospitality. 
Granted, Melanie isnt the nicest 
person, but given what shed encountered so far, I cant see 
the reason for wanting to stay, or why all of a sudden she is 
having the time of her life at a local dance.
Not that I have anything against the South. No, I was actu
ally annoyed at the countless references to Melanies southern 
heritage and cracks at the South. We get it, the Southern folk 
are funny, Northerners like to make fun of them, their twangy 
accents are funny, and New Yorkers have never been exposed 
to them, so on with the story already. As for the cast, Reese 
Witherspoon does fairly well in a role that is only mediocre. 
Josh Lucass Jake is cute and looks more like Matthew 
McConaughey in every scene. The two actors try their best to 
create chemistry between Jake and Melanie, but the stilted 
script wont allow for it. Other supporting cast includes 
Patrick Dempsey as Andrew, Melanies wealthy and caring 
fianc, and Candice Bergen as Andrews mother, the mayor of 
New York City.
fzssa vyls j,memlm is only a so-so romantic comedy with 
a few entertaining moments. It is not worth the eight dollars 
unless you are a die-hard fan of Witherspoon. You are better 
off renting a real romantic comedy to watch in the comfort of 
your own home.

21 CMU students arrested
Anti-capitalists, anarchists, 
radical youth, bicyclists, jour
nalists, and bystanders alike 
were blockaded by police and 
arrested on Friday, during the 
Peoples Strike in Washington, 
DC.
Plans to protest the World 
Bank/International Monetary 
Fund meetings over the course 
of the weekend included the 
Peoples Strike on Friday, 
intended to shut down the city 
by blocking all traffic and inter
sections. Nearly 2000 demon
strators participated, including 
about 100 bicyclists riding in 
Critical Mass, (a monthly ride 
to insist on safe streets for 
bikes) and many Pittsburgh res
idents. The official tally of 
arrests on Friday, given by 
Washington DC police chief 
Charles Ramsey is 649.
Fridays protests were almost 
entirely nonviolent; the only 
reported instances of violence 
were smashed windows at a 
Citibank, and two tires set on 
fire and thrown into the street.
Protestors at that scene were 
arrested and charged with riot
ing, but all other arrests were 
minor charges, mainly failure 
to obey, a charge that essen
tially amounts to a citation and 
a fine.
Saturdays actions included a 
large rally and a march to 
Farragut Square, near the 
World Bank/IMF buildings. 
The march ended in a quaran
tine - an attempt to circle the 
buildings. Activists linked 
arms, some held together with
duct tape, and sat in the road as 
the police presence increased 
to the point of a blockade that 
was six officers deep in some 
places. Police, some in full riot 
gear, made approximately 11 
arrests on Saturday, four of 
which were for possession of 
dangerous weapons.
Sunday concluded the week
end long demonstrations with 
a large rally protesting the pos
sible war on Iraq, with corre
sponding large scale anti-war 
rallies across Europe.

Pittsburgh protesters post bail and forfeit trial
Pillbox September 30, 2002
Free men must re-dedicate themselves to the 
cause of freedom. They must understand with a 
new certainty of conviction that the cause of 
freedom is a cause of the human individual. 
Human individuality is the basis of every value
 spiritual, moral, intellectual, creative  in 
human life.
 first lines of the poem on a statue in 
Freedom Plaza, where hundreds of activists 
and protesters were arrested on Friday; 
September 27, 2002.
Approximately 100 Pittsburgh residents attended the DC 
demonstration. The majority of Pittsburgh demonstrators 
participated in the Peoples Strike, blocking the intersection 
of Fourth, Constitution, and Pennsylvania Streets, close to the 
Capitol Building.
Mark Dixon, a masters student in art who managed to avoid 
arrest, said, The first thing we did was block an intersection, 
and it became very clear very quickly that we didnt have the 
numbers to do that successfully, so protesters attempted to 
disperse. Police eventually blocked them into Freedom Plaza, 
where hundreds of other people were arrested as well.
After attempting to leave the intersection, the group of 
Pittsburgh demonstrators began marching in the street and 
were followed closely by the police, explained Jared Glover 
via telephone late Friday afternoon from a bus where he and 
other protesters were being held.
Police and other authorities greatly outnumbered the pro
testors, and at one point, the police starting threatening us 
... so we started walking on the sidewalk, said Glover, a jun
ior in computer science.
But the cops followed in the streets, said Matt Toups, jun
ior computer science major, so the same amount of street was 
blocked, but by the cops - they were doing our job for us, 
referring to the demonstrators goal of shutting down the city.
Police followed protestors and eventually forced them into 
Freedom Plaza and Pershing Park, two parks separated by one 
small street. Freedom Plaza had a large (permitted) drum cir
cle there, and was also the official end point of the Critical 
Mass bicycle ride, intended to disrupt morning traffic.
Police on bicycles, horses, and in. riot gear surrounded the 
parks and slowly backed the protesters into the corner of 
Pershing Park - the area that the protestors had not obtained 
a permit for.
After holding at least 500 demonstrators - who were danc
ing, shouting, linking arms, chanting, and remaining peaceful
- in the park until 11am, the police, bearing canisters of tear 
gas and pepper spray, but without using them, made hun
dreds of arrests.
Protestors were charged with failure to obey a lawful order 
to disperse, though few in the park heard any police order.
We were all asking the police what was going on and if we 
were being detained, or if we were being charged, and they 
just stood there, silent, and wouldnt give us an answer, said 
sophomore art major Josh Atlas.
Glover said, It couldnt have been that they told us to dis
perse and we didnt, because we had nowhere to go.
Ben Magallon, sophomore architecture student, heard the 
police order, but said, we were told to disperse at one point, 
but they wouldnt let us go past the police barrier.
down were involved in the Saturday actions, however.
Nathan Shaffer, a University of Pittsburgh student and a 
member of the Pittsburgh Organizing Group, which arranged 
vans for nearly 80 people to travel to DC, explained the reason 
for avoiding the Mobilization for Global Justice rally on 
Saturday: We were told by the police that if we were arrest
ed again, or seen again in the protests, wed be in jail for much 
longer this time. Despite a lack of Pittsburgh participation, 
the Mobilization march and rally had a turnout of at least 
6000.
Police gathered up the arrested protesters and put them all 
on city buses marked special. Eventually, all buses were sent 
to either the Metropolitan Police Academy in Blue Plains or to 
the Superior Court building in downtown DC. Protesters were 
forced to stay on the buses until the police were ready to 
process them; some people were on the buses for as long as 17 
hours before being processed.
Quinten Steenhuis, junior logic and computation major, 
related the attitude of the DC police toward the arrested: The 
police officer who was on our bus told us, I hope this will 
teach you. Dont come back to DC next year.

Late Saturday evening, the 
last group of arrestees was 
released. Andy Mulkerin, a 
sophomore at the University of 
Pittsburgh, said, We actually 
got to the point where the 
woman who was arraigning 
everyone today got so sick of 
arraigning people that she let 
the last of us go without any 
charges, at about 8.30pm.

a Pittsburgh organization for
social justice activism, brought

Firsthand account: phone call from the 
bus of handcuffed arrestees
Friday, September 27.
2 pm telephone dictation
They corralled us and wouldnt let us 
leave. They wouldnt let us leave. They 
wouldnt tell us why we were being 
detained. They corralled us in and then 
eventually brought buses. They started 
cuffing people and putting us on buses 
without telling us why we were being 
arrested.
Were on the bus, waiting to be 
processed. The first couple buses have 
been processed. People are being 
charged with Failure to Obey, even 
though they didnt order us to do any
thing. No one is exactly sure how many 
people are there  at least a thousand.
I havent seen any protestor violence. 
The police rare randomly whacking peo
ple with their batons.
Everybodys in pretty good moods. 
There are other buses where people are 
singing. People here are talking and 
theres camaraderie, I guess.
Theres been some resistance to 
arrest. We were told to disperse at one 
point, but then they wouldnt let us go 
past the police barrier. Some people got 
thrown to the ground and shit.
the bus. People who were handcuffing 
us outside were angry men who were 
handcuffing us so tight out hands were 
turning blue, but then there are ladies 
on the bus who were loosening them for 
us [cutting the cuffs off and placing new 
ones on, less tightly]. Theyre plastic 
bands, not real handcuffs. They look like 
the stuff you tie stuff down with on 
palates, but theyre using them to hand
cuff people.
There were way more police than 
there were us. Theyre all in their swat 
gear and beating their batons... giant 
cans of mace and stuff. It was really 
intimidating.
We were the seventh bus back, there 
are still two buses in front of us. Theres 
at least another hour and a half to two 
hours before well get off the buses and 
into a jail area.
They detained us after we left the 
intersection and before we got to 
Freedom Plaza. They surrounded us, 
demanded to see IDs. Police accused us 
of breaking windows - we didnt.
I dont know if we expected ... I kind 
of expected to be arrested, but we 
werent doing anything, really, so its 
more just being pissed off.

Firsthand account: arrested without 
charges, detained for 25 hours
I was arrested at 11 am, handcuffed, 
and thrown onto a bus. My bus was 
taken to the Metropolitan Police 
Academy, where we were detained, 
handcuffed and on the bus, until 7 pm. 
By 9 pm, the other passengers on the bus 
with me and I were put in our detaining 
area, the gym of the police academy. 
Our wrists were un-cuffed from each 
other, and instead we had one wrist 
cuffed to the opposite ankle. We were 
seated on mats, cuffed wrist to ankle, 
from that point on. I was stuck on my 
mat from 9 pm until 11 am the next day.
During the 8 hours, handcuffed and 
detained on a bus, and then the follow
ing 14 hours, cuffed and detained on a 
gymnasium floor, I repeatedly asked for 
an explanation of the charges. We had 
been picked up for disobeying police 
orders, namely, to disperse from the 
park. However, we were never ordered 
to disperse, but instead, we were sur
rounded and refused the right to peace
fully exit the park.
I also repeatedly asked for an explana
tion of our options as prisoners. We 
were told that we could pay out, mean
ing we pay a fine and be released. 
However, none of the police knew the 
legal ramifications of doing so, and told 
us we would need to talk to a lawyer.
When I asked to speak to a lawyer, I was 
told that I would not be given a lawyer to 
consult with. I was told by several offi
cers that I could pay out and plead not 
guilty, and then be given a court date. I 
then agreed to pay out. However, the 
cop had lied to me, and I had at that 
point been entrapped into pleading 
guilty, and had lost my right to a trial by 
doing so.
I was illegally arrested by the DC 
police at 11 am Friday, and finally 
released at 11 am the next day. During 
that time I was never read my rights, 
never able to speak to a lawyer, never 
able to speak to an authority.at the sta
tion who knew what my options were. I 
was lied to by many officers claiming to 
know what my options were, when in 
fact they themselves did not understand 
the law.
Most outrageous, besides the fact that 
we were pushed by our surrounding 
armed forces into the illegal half of the 
park to be arrested, was the fact that our 
charge was merely a citation, not even a 
full misdemeanor, and we were arrested 
and detained for over 24 hours, some 
much longer.

Firsthand account: denied medical assistance
By the time we got on the bus, pretty much no 
one had any water. I didnt have any water left, 
and I was thirsty so I was asking my friends on the 
bus if they had any water to give me. I got a little 
but it wasnt enough to keep me from feeling sick.
I had a headache by the time that I got onto the 
bus and knew that I was getting dehydrated but 
figured that Id have a chance to get water by the 
time they took us to the place where they were 
going to detain us.
I still couldnt really get much water and after 
about three hours of being at Blue Plains on the 
bus, I asked if I could be taken to a water fountain.
I was brought to a water fountain, allowed 
about three gulps of water, and was taken back to 
the bus, basically not any better than I was before.
One of the officers on the bus was worried that 
Id pass out so she gave me 
maybe a quarter of a bottle of 
Gatorade that she hadnt drank 
herself yet. But at that point I 
was so sick that I couldnt even 
hold that down and was throw
ing up outside the bus.
I asked for medical attention.
They brought me to an EMS 
worker but told me that if I were 
to get medical attention then 
they wouldnt let me get money 
to pay for bail for my friends 
who were on the bus, and if I 
didnt do that, then they would
nt have been able to get out of 
jail. So I refused medical atten
tion and went back to the bus.
When I got back to the bus, some of my friends 
gave me some water that was left, and the bus 
driver gave me a granola bar and I was still unable 
to hold down any food or drink. So I sort of put my 
head down and passed out for a few minutes. I 
woke up again and felt that at that point it was 
probably unsafe for me to not get help, so I asked 
one of the officers if I could go back to the EMS 
people.
She told me that I had already refused medical 
attention, so she wasnt going to bring me back. 
So I put my head down again and just sort of tried 
to do my best with the little bit of water that I had.
Luckily, about 20 minutes after that, the med
ical worker that had seen me before was worried 
because of the shape that I was in and came to see 
if I was ok, and convinced the officers on my bus
to let me go.
There was another girl who had already been 
processed and was hogtied with her left wrist to 
her right ankle.
She had been asking for water for a while and 
they told her she wasnt allowed to get water 
unless she could get up and get water on her own, 
which she obviously couldnt do since she was 
hogtied.
She had gotten so bad that they needed to get 
an ambulance to take her to the hospital, and 
since I also had the same condition as her, the 
EMS workers managed to get me on the ambu
lance with her.
So I went to the hospital, got checked in, and 
then sat there for two and a half hours without 
anyone at the hospital giving me help.
Courtesy of Alexa Sorock
I was curled up and crying on the floor of the 
waiting room and asking everyone around me if 
they could get me some food or water. I asked a 
nurse if she could help me, and she told me that if 
I needed water, I should just drink from the bath
room sink. So after 2 and a half hours of that, I got 
some one to call me a cab and take me back to the 
church where I was staying.
They gave me a place to lie down, and gave me 
juice and some food to eat, and then I fell asleep.
Saturday, I decided that I was probably too 
weak to go to the protest and risk being arrested 
again, so I went to the Indymedia Center and 
helped out there.

We did it on the dryer and even now, 
in the brightness of this new day of fall 
I can feel her and the whir of the cold metal 
against my legs. Its funny how I used 
to just barge in as if I owned the world.
Stuck it in, claimed this land in the name
of his majesty Tyler,
from a country three blocks away
where trees line the street and houses are
purple.
The Dutch were too repressed, they 
never fucked. They painted houses colors like 
fuschia, marigold and the rich colors of grapes 
and wine. Drunk on her. Drunk on me.
The last time we were together she played 
Maxwell and the cops didnt come knocking 
She was a screamer. After, I tossed 
marbles into her black Timberland boot, lying 
on the other side of the room.
And we didnt do it that often. But it sounds 
poetic if I talk about rough sex on appliances 
and screaming in rooms the size of closets.
It was more than most fifteen-year-olds get.
And I was happy, elated, pimpin and struttin 
the halls of a school where no one knew this girl 
and her braids, her cute belly button, an outie, 
that winked if you ran your tongue across it 
lightly. She never liked it, said it tickled, but not 
in a giggly way, but in a bad, squeamish way.
Even in my mind now, I never do it. I resist 
tonguing her stomach.
 Tyler Lewis
Tyler hopes to someday be as great a poet as Kevin 
Gonzalez and maybe publish something in his lifetime. 
He wants to be a filmmaker, but sadly doesnt have 
anything to say that hasnt already been said by Spike 
Lee.

A Tidepool
Amidst the crashing jarring waves,
A tide pool lies in mystery
With crabs and creatures and other slaves
All at mercy of raging sea.
As the waves recede each day,
More creatures lost and swept away 
By Tritons horn from salty deep 
That wakes the ocean from its sleep.
With each note, dwellers recoil 
And burrow deep in rocky soil,
And some in pool withstand the test 
As the ocean claims all the rest.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond ^ J
Quackers and I went to the shore one day, for he had expressed to me a desire to spend a day by the sea. The smell of the salty air, the sound of the surf, the sight of the seagulls fly
ing overhead. Quackers reveled in all of these, taking them in with wonderment and awe. And then she appeared, the most beautiful duck that Quackers had ever seen. The year was 
1938, Duckette was her name, and beautiful was her countenance. Quackers begged for me to deliver a message. And so I walked over to her, bent down, and quietly told her, The 
young gentleduck over there wishes to send you his affections, and this flower. She seemed overjoyed at this and blushed deeply. I went to tell Quackers of his success, but when we 
turned to see her once more, she had disappeared into the mist.

Horoscopes: soul(less) food
ARIES (March 21  April 19): Keep everything in perspec
tive. Compared with the lonely decades you face praying for 
the reinstatement of blind arranged marriage while having 
solitary tea parties with your troll dolls, your date life at CMU 
is one big party.
TAURUS (April 20  May 20): Its time to concede and move 
on. She may seem perfect to you, but shes a Mac user and only 
attracted to pretty things, regardless 
of how fast they can compute.
GEMINI (May 21  June 21): Next 
time you serenade a girl, leave the 
bagpipes in your closet. That only 
works for water buffalo.
CANCER (June 22  July 22): Well, theres always the 
priesthood (assuming theyll accept you)....
LEO (July 23  August 22): 
At this point, "Im waiting for 
marriage," is probably your 
best excuse. Then you seem 
moral and stuff too!
VIRGO (August 23 
September 22): After yet another disappointing chat with that 
Icelandic guy from your online dating service, you will finally 
decide that of all the computing clusters to look for love in on 
a Friday night, the Wean clusters may not be your best choice.
LIBRA (September 23  October 23): The next time I catch 
you outside my window with your video camera and night 
vision lens attachment, Im calling the cops. Now thats a 
future you can count on.
SCORPIO (October 24  November 21): The Shakers wel
come you with open arms.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22  December 21): After an 
embarrassing incident with your Interpretation and Argument 
professor, you will finally realize that just because someone 
smiles and answers your questions doesnt mean theyre hitting 
on you.
CAPRICORN (December 22  January 19): You know how 
animals establish mating patterns based on natural 
pheromones? Spend any more time in chem lab and youll 
never be the chick magnet youve dreamed of, though you will 
be beating off horny rhinos with a 
stick.
AQUARIUS (January 20 
February 18): Stop worrying about 
your irregular facial hair growth. 
Theres a reason first dates are in dark 
movie theaters. He probably wont 
notice anyway.
Sara Sareen/Junior Staff
PISCES (February 19  March 20): Getting a girl to hang 
out in your Hamerschlag room to play on your X-Box and eat 
Top Ramen does not count as a first date, though it will elimi
nate the possibility of a second.
