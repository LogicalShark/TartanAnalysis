At 100, The Tartan 
still makes news
^___________A-/iBradford Yankiver
This is The Tartans first issue as a cen
tury-old newspaper. It took a big birth
day cake to fit all the candles. The icing 
on our cake couldnt have been sweeter 
last weekend; on Saturday we learned 
that The Tartan Online (www. thetartan. 
org) won a 2006 Associated Collegiate 
Press Online Pacemaker award.
My congratulations and thanks go 
to The Tartans online editor, Marshall 
Roch, who created the site just over a 
year ago during his first year at Carnegie 
Mellon. Everyone on staff deserves a 
round of applause, because the competi
tion judges not only the website but all 
the content as well.
The Online Pacemaker Award is the 
ACPs highest honor for online collegiate 
publications across the country. A total 
of eight other collegiate news websites 
received the honor this year.
Independent judges with expertise in 
design, journalism, and online media 
judged the entrants websites on the ba
sis of design, ease of navigation, writing 
and editing, graphics, and interactivity.
What makes this award particularly 
special for The Tartan is that Carnegie 
Mellon students created and maintain 
The Tartan Online from code to content. 
While all college newspapers create their 
own content, its becoming rare for col
lege newspapers to create and maintain 
their own websites. In fact, the websites 
of nearly 400 collegiate newspapers rest 
on websites owned by the MTV subsid
iary College Publisher. Not only are we 
pleased The Tartan Online is a great suc
cess, but we are proud that it remains 
free from relying on outside entities.
Roch built The Tartans website from 
the ground up. His talent and dedication 
have been absolutely indispensable.
Not only has Roch created a fantas
tic and award-winning online home for 
The Tartan, but today marks the launch 
of The Tartans all-new ScheduleMan. 
org. ScheduleMan is an online tool that 
makes it faster and easier than ever for 
students to build their class schedules.
ScheduleMan.org lets users search 
for keywords in both course titles and 
descriptions. The site also makes it easy 
for users to switch classes and sections 
to find just the right schedule. Schedule
Man can also now export a semesters 
class schedule to iCal, Google Calendar, 
and Outlook.
To make things sweeter, The Tartans 
forum editor, Marshall Roy, took home 
an award for writing one of the best stu
dent editorials in the country. Roy won 
third place in the Editorial category of 
the Story of the Year competition. Roy 
has moderated the opinon and editori
als section of The Tartan with grace and 
ease and has brought new vibrance to 
the public forum we strive to provide.
These wonderful successes show the 
ingenuity and vigor with which todays 
staff does its work, and they come at the 
perfect time. As we celebrate our anni
versary, it is only right that we should be 
approaching our work with the same en
trepreneurial sprit and dedication that 
gave rise to The Tartan 100 years ago.
Ive thought a lot about what it means 
to be part of this long tradition; its still 
hard to grasp. Ive always felt like we, 
the current staff, are the end of the line, 
but we are at the helm for a blink of an 
eye in the context of the papers history.
The staff of The Tartan feel great own
ership in this newspaper, and rightly so 
 they continuously give of themselves 
to create each weeks newspaper. But 
knowing that the work of a hundred for
mer staffs of The Tartan is responsible 
for giving us the chance we have now 
changes my perspective.
The work we do now is important be
cause its good for our community today 
Its even more important because its 
our part in making sure that all students 
who come to Carnegie Mellon will have 
a newspaper that serves them.
Brad L. Yankiver, publisher of The Tartan, 
welcomes all responsible questions and 
comments, which may be sent to publisher@thetartan.org.

Mayor Ravenstahl speaks to students on campus
by Benjamin Hackett
Staffwriter
Pittsburgh mayor Luke Raven
stahl addressed a small crowd 
at Carnegie Mellon University 
in the University Center last 
Wednesday.
Ravenstahl spoke to about one 
dozen Carnegie Mellon students 
and faculty. His speech focused 
on his commitment to his mayoral responsibilities and the ad
vantages of his youth in relating 
to and keeping young profession
als. The mayor cited youth as the 
key to Pittsburghs successful de
velopment.
We [are losing] individuals 
like yourself, Ravenstahl said to 
the college students in the crowd. 
His remarks highlight what some 
local politicians have called the 
Pittsburgh brain drain, which 
occurs when college graduates 
pack their bags and leave the 
Pittsburgh metro area.
At 26 years old, Ravenstahl is 
the youngest mayor of a major 
metropolitan city. He assumed 
the duties of the mayors office 
after the recent death of previous 
mayor Bob OConnor. OConnor 
died from brain cancer on

Debela while Stanley Onyimba, a first-year in H&SS, looks on.
September 1.
The mayor spoke briefly to the 
audience before heading into a 
question-and-answer section.
In the question-and-answer 
period, Ravenstahl discussed a 
few new projects. One student 
asked about the success of one 
such initiative, the newly created 
Ravenstahl Response Line, 311. 
The mayors website describes 
the 311 line as a central one call 
system for all non-emergency 
city service requests. 
Ravenstahl said the average 
call volume for reports of non
emergency service requests were 
150 per day before the response 
311 line. After the launch, call 
volumes have increased to nearly 
300 per day, an increase Raven
stahl views as an early indicator 
of success.
While he showcased some 
accomplishments, he didnt 
put themor studentsinto 
a greater perspective, wrote 
Student Body President Karl 
Sjogren in an e-mail. For ex
ample ... he failed to connect the 
importance [of the 311 line]if 
anyto the current needs of
Pittsburgh..
One audience member asked 
about the mayors proposed 
Youth Advisory Committee, a 
group to be made up of college 
students. Recently, the mayor 
appointed a staff member to 
head the committee and has 
been pushing to form the board 
soon.
The advisory board will focus 
on and be made up of those in 
the 21-35 age range, considered 
the age range of young profes
sionals. Ravenstahl urged Carn
egie Mellon students to contact 
his office if they desired to give 
input or seek participation on 
the advisory board.
I got the sense that students 
didnt feel like the mayor was 
actively addressing their con
cerns, and I felt that the mayor 
wasnt sure how to even create 
a productive exchange between 
college students and city hall, 
Sjogren wrote.
Ravenstahl urged students to 
contact him with ideas and con
cerns.
The City of Pittsburgh web
site h ttp://www. ci ty. pittsb urgh.

dividuals can send comments to

The Academic Affairs Commit
tee of Student Senate organized a 
forum last Tuesday that allowed 
students to speak their minds.
A diverse group of students, 
both undergraduates and sev
eral graduate students from the 
Heinz School of Public Policy and 
Management, came to see how 
the university makes procedural 
changes.
Evan Osheroff, a sophomore in 
the Mellon College of Science and 
the Academic Affairs Commit
tee chair for the undergraduate 
Student Senate, facilitated the 
event. His goal was to hear stu
dent opinions on issues the uni
versity can improve; to keep the 
discussion honest, he gave out 
notecards at the door on which 
people could anonymously write 
their comments. Osheroff started 
discussions based on the notecard he pulled out from among 
those turned in.
The meeting began with a note 
from an audience member com
plimenting the level of student 
involvement.
The discussion then turned 
to alumni, as another comment 
brought to question whether 
campus maintenance affects 
alumni pride and their subse
quent contributions. A partici
pant said the current state of 
groundskeeping and mainte
nance was not up to par.
Osheroff answered by point
ing out how far Carnegie Mel
lon has come, considering that 
it is still a relatively new school. 
He dismissed the correlation 
between campus maintenance 
and alumni donations.
In the recent years a lot of 
clubs and organizations have 
come up, so the current alumni 
feel better about the campus, 
he said.
The next notecard question 
claimed a lack of unity among 
programs. Once students start 
specializing in their majors, 
the card said, they rarely meet 
people of other backgrounds in 
their classes.
To solve this problem, one 
student suggested taking initia
tive.
I try to get the RAs to work 
together, said Byron Chou, 
suggesting joint programming 
between housing areas. Chou 
is a sophomore in business and 
a resident assistant (RA) in Ca
thedral Mansions.
Another notecard addressed 
convenience and suggested 
the university add computer 
access in the University Center.

the UC are in West Wing and

Local high school students create popular podcast
by Patrick Pettibon
Staffwriter
Two Pittsburgh high school 
students have been broadcasting 
the deepest truth of their hearts 
over the Internet. Their show, 
Acorns and Merlot, has grown 
in popularity as one of the 
only podcasts in the country 
produced entirely by high school 
students.
Lucian Baxter Wintrich IV, 
now a senior in high school, cre
ated his podcast about a year 
ago. According to Liberated 
Syndication, one of the largest 
podcast publishers that monitors 
downloads, 1000 to 2500 people 
listen to each episode of Acorns 
and Merlot.
The show is really, really 
good, said Becca Ridge, a soph
omore at Schenley High School 
who has listened to the show 
since the summer. Its like a lit
tle treat at the beginning of the 
week.
Wintrich began producing the 
show after leaving Taylor Allderdice High School amid accu
sations of assaulting a security 
guard. Due to legal threats from 
a fanatical listener, he was un
able to disclose the name of the 
school he currently attends. He 
explains the entire story behind 
transferring high schools in epi
sode six, Ms. Thorn and the As
sault Set-Up.
It started up as more of an 
outlet, Wintrich said. It was 
kind of therapeutic.
A podcast is an Internet radio 
show that can be downloaded to 
iPods or other listening devices. 
Wintrich and co-host Marc Wer
ner, a senior at Schenley High 
School, produce one podcast ep
isode each week. After meeting 
through a mutual friend, Win
trich invited Werner to become a 
permanent fixture on the show.
The show covers many topics, 
from fashion and high school 
banter to politics and religion. 
The hosts also include stories 
from their personal lives and 
short news reports.
I like to discuss everything 
from my love life to my experi
ences in school to my reaction to 
current events, Werner wrote in 
an e-mail.
The shows target audience is 
from ages 12 to 18, but listeners 
of all ages tune in each week. The 
actual ages go from about nine to 
55, Wintrich said. The podcasts 
audience has also spread over
seas  in one episode, Wintrich 
interviewed Jamie, a listener in 
Scotland.
As soon as it comes out, I lis

junior at Fox Chapel High School 
who has listened to the show for

about a year. The social com
mentary they have  I can re
ally relate to it. Its a really fun 
program to listen to.
Acorns and Merlot offers a look 
inside the minds of the hosts. 
The co-hosts bring with them a 
few topics theyd like to discuss 
and let the conversation develop 
naturally. The show is mostly 
improvised, Wintrich said.
Frequently we wont tell each 
other certain stories until we 
are on the air so that our 
reactions are genuine, Werner 
wrote.
In the first episodes, Acorns 
and Merlot was just recorded 
telephone conversations. Win
trich and Werner have since 
upgraded to a Tascam recorder, 
Audio Technica condenser mi
crophones, pop filter, and mi
crophone arms. The hosts have 
bought all of the equipment 
themselves.
The only podcast in Pittsburgh
 and one of the only in the 
country  hosted by high school 
students, Acorns and Merlot may 
be in jeopardy over the next year, 
as Wintrich and Werner leave 
Pittsburgh for college.
One idea is that well pass 
down the whole vision of 
Acorns and Merlot to younger 
students from Allderdice and 
Schenley, Wintrich said. They 
could keep it alive, and then it 
will be solely a high school show. 
[But] it does chronicle our lives
 we could pack it up and take 
it to college.

The Tartan celebrates 100 years
Academic Affairs asks students to speak their minds
by Greg Hanneman
Copy Manager
Wednesday, October 24,1906 
is a momentous date, one that 
should be memorized by every 
freshman and which should be 
engraved in gold or at least brass 
in the heart of every Techite.
So wrote an anonymous Tar
tan editor in a front-page article 
on February 12, 1946, using the 
week after a newspaper-wide re
design to comment on the orga
nizations first issue.
This week, The Tartan cel
ebrates the 100th anniversary of 
that inaugural publication.
The Tartan has undergone 
many changes in the past cen
tury. It began as an eight-page 
weekly promising to place be
fore the student body not only 
those events which have hap
pened but newsy items of events 
to come, supplemented by occa
sional essays from faculty mem
bers. The paper was originally 
organized by Frederic E. Foster, 
who became the first editor-inchief before graduating from the 
Carnegie Technical Schools in 
1908 with a degree in metallur
gical engineering.
The focus of the paper has var
ied widely, even from its early 
years.
Fosters first issue included a 
recap of two Carnegie Tech foot
ball games, an outlook for the 
rest of the season, and a number 
of news items about meetings 
and class elections. News from 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School for Women  including 
an update on the construction of 
the schools new building, now 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Hall  appeared on a separate 
page.
Gossip columns; movie re
views; and city, national, and 
international news have made 
appearances at different times 
in The Tartan depending on the
campus environment.
During the thirties when Tech 
was a big football school and 
there was more spirit, campus 
politics and organization news 
made the front page fairly regu
larly.... At that time there was a 
greater demand for a womens 
page, and coverage of city news, 
stated an October 30, 1956, ar
ticle on the occasion of The Tar
tans 50th anniversary. During 
the war, however, the paper was 
necessarily smaller, lacked funds 
and staff, and was beset with the 
problem of keeping news light 
.when the word was anxious and 
saddened.
The number of staff members 
has also affected the papers size 
and content. It was a very small 
staff, said Janyce Hedetniemi, 
The Tartans co-editor for the 
1960-61 school year. We were 
always searching for things to 
write about. At the time, He
detniemi said, the paper carried 
mostly campus news instead of 
world news or commentary.
Colt Foutz, a 2000 graduate, 
started a sports commentary col
umn during his senior year. Id 
been writing e-mails to friends 
riffing on sports, he said, and 
he ended up forwarding some of 
them to The Tartans sports edi
tor.
At times, the newspapers con
tent brought it into conflict with 
the university administration or 
other parts of the campus com
munity.
Susan Klein, who worked on 
The Tartans entertainment sec
tion between 1972 and 1976, 
remembers controversy over 
students critically reviewing the
atrical productions produced by 
other students. She also recalled 
a restaurant review for an eat
ery called Farmer Daves that 
a staff member turned in after 
deadline. The restaurant was 
imaginary.
Hedetniemi recalled an anon
ymous letter to the editor con
taining unsubstantiated allega
tions against the Carnegie Tech 
administration that nearly got 
her and her co-editor, Bill Pence, 
expelled from school. The let
ter was printed in The Tartan by 
mistake, and University Presi
dent Jake Warner called her and 
Pence before him to explain.
Tartan staff members have 
also seen significant changes in 
the newspapers production pro
cess and the way they interact 
with content.
At one time, finished pages had 
to be transported to the printers 
office downtown. We would put 
the paper together ... and then 
none of us had cars, Hedetni
emi said. We were dependent 
on whoever we could grab.... 
We were always scrambling at 
the last minute. You couldnt get 
downtown where we were going 
on the streetcar or bus.
Before the staff used comput
ers for production, editors manu
ally pasted blocks of copy, pho
tos, and headlines onto layout 
sheets to be photographed for 
an offset press. During the mid1970s, text was printed from a 
Compugraphic typesetting ma
chine on sheets of paper that had 
to be hung up to dry before be
ing used, Klein said. Editors then 
sprayed the pages with a fixative 
and ran them through a waxing 
machine before pasting them 
into a layout.
Foutz said he wrote his col
umns at home and e-mailed 
them to his editor. I had a lot 
of freedom, and he had a lot of 
reading, he said.
Over the century, the Tartan 
staff has been shifted, as the 
physical location of The Tartans 
production moved around cam
pus. The first office was in Por
ter, the only building on campus 
when The Tartan was founded, 
before moving to the south mez
zanine of the College of Fine Arts 
building. In the 1950s, the news
paper had space on the top floor
of the Union, a converted man
sion that stood on the present site 
of Doherty Apartments. In 1961, 
the newspaper office moved into 
the newly opened Skibo student 
center and remained there un
til 1994, when student organi
zations were moved to the Old 
Student Center, known then as 
the Navy building. Skibo was de
molished to make way for todays 
University Center, and The Tar
tan moved into its current thirdfloor office in the UC in 1996.
Not only has The Tartan 
changed in the last century, the 
entire medium of newspapers 
has as well. To keep up with the 
rapid technological advances of 
the 21st century, The Tartan is 
fostering relationships with the 
Carnegie Mellon television sta
tion, cmuTV. In doing so, The 
Tartan staff will broadcast news 
in the coming months via the 
airwaves and stream up-to-date 
video on the papers website, 
www. thetartan. org.
From the pages of The Tartan 
to the professional world, some 
newspaper alumni have gone on 
to careers in journalism and pro
fessional writing.
Klein went from writing arts 
and entertainment pieces for The 
Tartan to a 10-year career doing 
freelance music reviews for such 
publications as Rolling Stone and 
the San Francisco Chronicle.
I merely have The Tartan to 
thank for my career and mar
riage and first book, Foutz wrote 
in an e-mail. Interested in a jour
nalism career after writing for 
The Tartan, Foutz worked at the 
daily Sandusky Register in Ohio, 
where he met his wife, and The 
Naperville Sun in Illinois before 
turning to non-fiction writing 
earlier this year.
The Tartan experience 
showed me that I could do it ev
ery week, he said. I think that 
senior year experience of writing 
the sports column showed that 
my ideas were legitimate.
most discussion questioned meal 
plans, and the comment sug
gested meals blocks are too ex
pensive. However, the students 
disagreed about a conclusion.
I think the best way to change 
the prices of food would be for 
CMU to work out better deals 
with vendors or to find new ven
dors, Weeks said.
Carnegie Mellon currently 
works under a contract with 
Parkhurst, a company that acts
as a liaison between third-party 
vendors.
Following the discussion, 
Osheroff will review the topics 
with Indira Nair, the vice-provost for education. Togther, they 
will implement what changes 
they see fit.
It would be nice if a followup report would be sent out on 
what has happened, what meet
ings have taken place, and what 
changes work, Weeks said.
course. One audience member 
suggested reassigning some of 
the teachers and having an engi
neering teacher conduct the class 
in a way that is more technical 
and familiar to the students who 
are not creative thinkers.
Osheroff said the option was 
not viable.
It would take more time to 
train those teachers in those 
fields, he said.

As nature bursts into color 
this autumn, chemical processes 
transform leaves, and leaf peep
ers hike through mountains in 
pursuit of natures deepest hues.
In autumn, large changes come 
in small sizes.
Frederick Utech, adjunct pro
fessor of biological sciences, said 
that when temperatures drop, 
autumn leaves form an abscission 
zone, or a collection of tightly 
grouped cells within the leaf. As 
this happens, the leafs chloro
phyll molecules break down and 
other pigments show through.
Leaves contain several color 
pigments, the most dominant of 
which is chlorophyll, the green 
pigment that is responsible for 
photosynthesis. When the chlo
rophyll breaks down, it produces 
magnesium, which goes back 
into the tree to make chlorophyll 
for next year.
In a forest, nothing is given or 
destroyed. Thats basic physics 
and chemistry, Utech said.
The color change is also eco
logical, meaning that it depends 
on environmental history, selec
tion, and response. The first cool 
night in autumn usually triggers 
changes in the leaves biochem
istry, which lead to different col
ors.
Part of the reason that autumn 
landscapes are colorfully trans
formed is that colors change all at 
once for deciduous, or leaf-bear
ing, trees.
Whether youre in New Eng
land or in the Smoky Mountains
or anywhere in between, the ap
pearance of color is synchronized 
for that area, Utech said.
Most deciduous forests contain 
tree species that are generations 
old. Some of these species have 
undergone climatic selection, 
and so they change color at the 
same time.
That is why you get the whole 
hillside in color, said Utech, 
pointing toward Schenley Park. 
You have to gaze beyond Pitts
burgh, however, to get the full 
flavor of autumn colors.
Utech said that color diversity 
is greater in the south than in the 
north, because the deciduous for
ests in New England do not have 
as many deciduous species as in 
Pennsylvania. Likewise, the mid
dle and southern Appalachians 
experience more shades of red 
than in New England because 
there are more species in the Ap
palachian area.
So the range of colors is going 
to be quite different in the range 
of deciduous forests, Utech said.
The Rocky Mountains, for in
stance, have only one deciduous 
species, the aspen, but this spe
cies exhibits intense yellow in 
autumn.
Its a little different story than 
whats going in the East, he said. 
Youre not talking about all these 
colors, but its still pretty spectac
ular, he said.
Utechs favorite foliage comes 
from the Great Smoky Mountains 
in North Carolina. He said that 
the mountains allow people to 
see the vertical presentation of 
leaf colors.

Carnegie Mellon inventions make life easier for community
; LTIs creation links callers with Port Authority transit
by Andrew Peters
Assistant Personnel Manager
Thanks to Carnegie Mellons 
. Language Technologies Insti
tute (LTI), there is no excuse 
for getting stranded at" the 
Waterfront on a Sunday night. 
Since March 2005, Lets Go, a 
^dialogue system developed at 
rj the LTI, has been helping Pitts
burgh Port Authoritys patrons 
get where they need to be at all 
hours of the day and night.
In 2002, the National Science 
r Foundation approved a grant for 
r Lets Go, giving Maxine Eskenazi and Alan Black, associate 
 professors of computer science, 
$650,000 to work with the Port 
Authority on the development of 
a spoken dialogue system.
The two work with a team 
comprising several of the LTIs 
faculty members and graduate 
,, students, along with customer 
j service experts at the Port Au
thority.
According to research assis
tant and Ph.D. candidate An
toine Raux, Lets Go was origi
nally intended to assist what 
Raux called nonstandard 
populations, meaning those 
who normally have problems 
with technology, such as the 
elderly and non-native English 
speakers.
However, the system now 
serves anyone who calls the 
Port Authoritys regular cus
tomer service line. Patrons 
need only call after hours to 
interact with Lets Gos system.
We did a presentation for the 
Port Authority, and they asked 
us if we could put that online 
for customers, Raux said. Af
ter three years of development, 
Lets Go started talking to the 
Port Authoritys customers.
During the day, patrons who 
call are connected to a human 
customer service representa
tive. But when riders call at 
times that the Port Authority 
office isnt open, Lets Go will
assist the riders.
[The representatives] do 
wonderful, fantastic jobs of 
giving information, Eskenazi 
said. We dont replace them, 
we just answer the phone when 
theyre not working.
Both the LTI and the Port 
Authority benefit from the col

Three Ph.D. candidates devise way to track dollars
by Nimish Gautam
Junior Staffwriter
It's a common situation 
among roommates: Having just 
received a bill for this months 
utilities, everyone tries to figure 
out how much is owed and who 
owes what.

After seeing this same situ
ation continually occur, three 
Ph.D. candidates in Carnegie 
Mellons computer science de
partment decided to do some
thing about it.
Traditionally, roommates 
have broken out trusty pen 
and paper to try to figure out
the money situation, but by the 
time that happens the bill can 
already be past due. But Ashwin Bharambi, Amit Manjhi, 
and Shashank Pandit turned to 
technology instead. The three 
designed www.buxfer.com to 
keep track of expenses.
It started as a personal thing, 
a set of scripts, then people 
started asking us for copies 
friends, friends of friends, un
til we finally decided to build a 
website, Bharambi said.
The online tool is free and is 
designed to maintain transac
tions and personal finances. 
Many similar sites exist, but 
what makes Buxfer unique, and 
what constitutes 70 percent to 
80 percent of its use, is the abil
ity to create group transactions 
with other users and the fact 
that one can keep track of these 
transactions easily.
We tried to make this site 
very simple and very usable 
for the common cases, Manjhi 
said. :
The websites interface is 
similar to Googles Gmail ser
vice, complete with associated 
functionality and ease of use. 
Almost every transaction field 
is able to handle the most com
mon transaction types, allowing 
users to create new transactions 
with little more than a descrip
tion and an amount. Users can 
also associate other users with 
the transaction.
One click later, all members of 
the transaction are notified via 
e-mail, all totals are updated, 
and the transaction is viewable 
and editable by anyone who was 
involved.
When you enter transactions, 
a bunch of stuff gets taken care of 
automatically, Bharambi said, 
highlighting a definite advan
tage over the traditional Post-It 
or notebook paper method.

Free online speech^ 
becomes issue
The human rights group Am

bloggers to draw attention to 
cases where other bloggers have 
been jailed for what they wrote 
online and to defend their right 
to free speech online.
The organization is concerned 
with the growing amount of gov
ernment interference in online 
journals, including the imple
mentation of firewalls that blocjc 
access to sites and the forcibte 
shutdown of blogs.
The arrest of Iranian blogger 
Kianoosh Sanjari for blogging 
about conflicts between the 
Iranian police and supporters 
of Shia cleric Ayatollah Boroujerdi was just one example of 
the dangers bloggers face, said

measure would, according to the,, 
ISC, stop bloggers from anony-*1

information on the Internet and 
creating a negative influence op

If the government agrees tp 
the ISCs request, which the ISfc

Fifty-six percent of activevideo game players play gam^s 
online, according to a recent 
survey conducted by Nielsen

percent, 64 percent are female.
The survey also confirmed 
the growth of casual gaming,

Twins born with 
different skin color
A woman in Britain recently 
gave birth to twin boys who do 
not share the same skin color. 
Scientists believe that the event 
is due to a rare genetic occur
rence in which the mother 
passed off two seperate genetic 
codes to the twins.
The boys were both born 
white, but as time progressed 
one of the boys became darker 
and the other became lighter. 
Scientists believe this is due to 
the mother being of mixed race 
(she has Nigerian and English 
ancestors) and the father being 
white.
Skin color is determined by 
genes that are passed from par
ent to child. Normally, the genes 
that determine a persons skin 
color are mixed together, but 
scientists believe that did not 
happen in the twins case.

The Gateway Arch, 630 feet 
tall and another 630 feet wide, 
is an elegant frame to the his
toric city of St. Louis. A gigan
tic endeavor in its time, the 
arch is almost 100 feet taller 
than the Washington Monu
ment and more than twice the 
height of the Statue of Liberty. 
It contains over 5000 tons of 
steel and nearly 40,000 tons of 
concrete.
In 1935, the United States 
government sanctioned the riv
erfront location of the arch, of
ficially known as the Jefferson 
National Expansion Memorial. 
The initiative accrued about 40 
blocks worth of city space, but 
the project sank into a 12-year 
hiatus in the chaos of the Sec
ond World War.
Memorial plans resurfaced 
in 1947, when architect Eero 
Saarinen won a countrywide 
competition for its design. His 
proposal, the original concept 
of the Gateway Arch, described 
a monument in the shape of an 
inverse catenary curve.
The catenary, often confused 
with the parabola, is the curve 
formed by a hanging chain held 
only at its ends. Responding to 
the force of gravity, the slope 
of the chain is shallowest at its 
center, growing ever steeper 
towards its hanging points, 
where the most weight must be 
supported.
The catenary curve conforms
Workers added another 42 
sections, leaving only the two 
keystones. While these were 
being positioned, a jacking 
frame put pressure on the arch. 
The creeper derricks were then 
used to remove the stabilizing 
truss and each vertical track.
Though construction of the 
Gateway Arch hadnt begun 
until 1963, the arch was com
pleted in 1965, costing only $15 
million. By 1968, its one-of-akind tram system was open to 
the public.
Elevator businessman Dick 
Bowsers proposal was one part 
elevator, one part Ferris wheel, 
in light of the unique circum
stances of the archs structure. 
Like in a Ferris wheel, the pas
sengers weight helps to stabi
lize their environment. There 
are two trams, one for each leg. 
Composed of eight five-passenger barrels, the trams can hold 
up to 40 visitors at a time. Each 
barrel is comparable in size to 
that of a cement mixer.
Throughout the trip, the bar
rels rotate 155 degrees. At the 
base of the arch, the barrels 
hang from the track, but by 
the time they reach the top the 
track is beneath them.
It only takes four minutes for 
each tram to make its ascent 
and three to return to the bot
tom. About 160 people can fit 
on the observation deck at the 
archs apex. Loading occurs in 
the Museum of Westward Ex
pansion, located underground 
directly beneath the arch.
to the shape of a hyperbolic co
sine function.
The Gateway Arch is com
posed of many different pieces, 
or sections, in the shapes of 
equilateral triangles. The wid
est bottom sections are 54 feet 
in length (with a 40-foot hollow 
in the center) and 12 feet high, 
while the two keystone pieces 
are 17 feet long (15 1/2 inside) 
and eight feet tall.
Each section contains an 
inner layer made up of threeeighths of an inch of A-7 car
bon steel. The smooth, radiant 
exterior consists of 900 tons of 
stainless steel panels, each as 
thick as 14 inches.
The initial sections of the 
arch were so large that they 
had to be welded on site. Each 
triangular section arrived as 
three individual legs, con
nected via welding on a 56-foot 
by 125-foot pad of concrete. 
Subsequent sections to the arch 
were small enough that this 
part of process could be com
pleted at the factory.
Ground-operated creeper 
cranes lowered each section 
into place for the first 72 feet of 
the arch. Separated by jacks en
forcing a four-inch gap, the sec
tions were welded inside and 
out, and concrete was poured 
to fill the spaces between the 
layers of carbon and stainless 
steel.
Workers continued using 
concrete in this way until the 
300th level of construction.

Go has certainly produced much 
of, garnering somewhere in the 
vicinity of 30,000 calls since it 
started working the late shift al
most two years ago.
When you call, we abide by 
a legal experimental disclaimer 
that you are being recorded 
for research purposes to bet
ter the system, Eskenazi said. 
She noted that the system has 
been quite successful, averaging 
about 40 to 50 calls each night.
Having been originally de
signed for people who normally 
have trouble with technology, 
the system is interactive in many 
ways.
Just as a human can sense 
frustration and subsequently 
change the way he or she asks 
questions, Eskenazi and her co
workers ensured that Lets Go 
can do the same.
We train the system with 
normal speech, Eskenazi said. 
When someone gets frustrated, 
their speech changes and rec
ognition may not work as well. 
To avoid this situation, when we
think we are getting in an impasse 
we use a back-off strategy.
The back-off strategy is a 
mechanism that Lets Go fea
tures to keep user frustration 
from altering their experience.
In an ongoing effort to im
prove the quality of the system, 
Eskenazi and Black will host a 
Lets Go lab, where the two will 
work with other researchers in 
their field to study and analyze 
the program.
According to Eskenazi, faculty 
from Columbia, Stanford, and 
MIT will contribute to the proj
ect by analyzing pools of data 
and performing studies on a 
modified version of the system.
[An] advantage is that we have 
complete control of the system, 
Raux said. The Port Author
ity trusts us to keep the user in 
mind.
Right now the system has only 
one line and covers only certain 
heavily traveled bus lines along 
Pittsburghs east end. The sys
tem specifically covers those 
that serve Shadyside, Squirrel 
Hill, and Oakland. Eskenazi, 
Raux, and their colleagues are
looking into expanding the sys
tem by installing more lines and 
extending the coverage to other 
neighborhoods.
Though the system currently 
has limitations, Eskenazi views 
the work that she and her team 
are doing with Lets Go as cru
cial to the Port Authority and to 
research at the LTI.
If we were not there, there 
would be no one answering the 
phone, Eskenazi said.

He also recommended taking 
a day trip to Seven Springs or 
the Laurel Highlands. There is 
enough vertical relief in these 
places, he said, that you get the 
feeling of being surrounded by 
forests.
A small plane or hot air bal
loon ride, he said, would also 
be a good way to see the foliage. 
Its kind of neat to just see all of 
the colors fly by you.
You do not have to be airborne, 
however, to catch a glimpse of 
the colors. This year, the Tucker 
County Alpine Festival hosted 
the 18th Annual Leaf Peepers 
Festival in Canaan Valley, W.Va., 
the weekend of September 23.
William Smith, the director of 
the festivals information center, 
said, Its a growing festival to 
celebrate the arrival of the fall 
colors.
During the festival, people 
participate in various events, 
including hiking, fly fishing, and 
a golf tournament. Leaf peepers 
also tour the mountains and take 
pictures along side roads.
The festivals position is to 
get them here, and after that, 
they can do what they like, said 
Smith. Its just a very alive week
end area wide.
Smith said that the festival 
is also an opportunity for busi
nesses to sponsor everts.
Canaan Valley is popular for 
its mix of reds and oranges. The 
reds from maples turn as early 
as late August, with yellow con
sistently turning throughout the 
season.
I think the colors around here 
rival what youre going to find in 
New England, Smith said.
But in spite of the West Vir
ginia landscape, thousands of 
visitors flock to New England 
each year to catch a glimpse of 
bright yellows and reds.
According to the Boston 
Globes article Leaf Peepers 
Flock to N.H., 1.1 million vehi
cles passed through New Hamp
shire tollbooths last Columbus 
Day weekend, right around the 
time of peak foliage.
People are very happy so far, 
said Vicky Cimino, a spokes
woman for the New Hampshire 
Division of Travel and Tourism 
Department.
Fall is an important season 
for us. Its our second-busiest 
season [after summer]. Its a bil
lion-dollar season.
Regardless of location, you 
will have to plan ahead if you 
want to catch the peak of fall fo
liage. Smith said that peak foli
age happens nearly overnight in 
Canaan Valley.
Its just that one time when 
you look out and say Man, this 
is it, he said. Its just an ab

served as the primary connec
tions between the inner and 
outer walls.
Past the height of 72 feet, 
the use of cranes was no longer 
practicable. Workers switched 
to creeper derricks, two 100- 
ton pieces of equipment, which 
literally climbed the arch as 
construction progressed.
Each derrick had a pair of 
adjustable steel legs able to 
hug the arch. The legs adjusted 
to the varying curvature and 
height of the completed sec
tions. At this point in the pro
cess, the additions weighed
snawn wertz/science & technology tditor
about 50 tons per section, but 
required only about 30 minutes 
to be properly positioned.
When construction reached 
a height of 530 feet, workers 
added a stabilizing truss to 
secure each separate leg. The 
truss was made of alloy steel 
and constructed on location.
About 60 tons in weight, the 
225-foot truss was lifted into 
place through the use of both of 
the creeper derricks. Steel har
nesses held the truss in place on 
either side, directing forces due 
to gravity and wind towards 
the archs strong foundations.

Last Wednesday, the highest court of 
New Jersey ruled that state laws must be 
changed to allow equal rights for hetero
sexual and homosexual couples. They 
have left the contentious question of how 
to label those couples up to the legisla
ture, however. Do we call a committed, 
legally recognized same-sex partnership 
a civil union or a marriage?
We vote for the latter, and we hope the 
New Jersey legislature does the same. 
With religious complications factored 
out, there is no legal justification for the 
exclusion of homosexuals from tradi
tional matrimony.
Semantics has become a fundamental 
and unfortunate part of the gay mar
riage debate. Some people oppose mar
riage rights for gay couples because they 
believe gay relationships are morally 
wrong. Some oppose not the couples, 
but the terminology of calling gay cou
ples married in the eyes of the state.
Legally, marriage is a contract entered 
into by two people, restricted in most 
states to a man and a woman. It seems 
simple to note, however, that two men or 
two women are just as able to enter into 
a contract as a man and a woman.
Unfortunately, we use the same words 
to describe a legal marriage as we do 
for a marriage recognized by a specific 
religion or other institution. In the states

Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Last week, we gave a short pre
sentation to all Introduction to 
World History classes outlining 
the structure and purpose of stu
dent government. The presenta
tion updated each section as to 
what projects were currently 
working on, how students can 
get in contact with us, and how 
we come up with our ideas. How
ever, we think its important that 
more than just first-years know 
the answers to these questions.
We get our ideas from one 
place: you. Students have sug
gested ideas, recommended 
changes, or forwarded us infor
mation that has led student gov
ernment to start new initiatives.
Getting your ideas to us is sim
ple: Talk to us in person, give us 
a call, or send us an e-mail. The 
Contact Us page on our web
site is another way to contact us 
quickly. You can forward us a 
website, send us an outline, or ar
range a meeting to discuss what 
change youd like to see happen. 
You set the agenda, so dont be 
afraid of putting yourself on it.
Were at a large institution, 
and change isnt necessarily easy 
to achieve. We believe trying to 
effect the most amount of com
prehensive change is the key to 
being successful. Its a game of 
numbers. If the chance of initia
tives being successful is only 15 
percent, the only way to ensure 
broad results is to make sure 
were trying to improve as many 
sections of campus life as possi
ble. So please send us your ideas 
and add to the number of proj
ects were currently working on. 
This is what we work for.
Some of the purposes for the 
projects weve taken on this se
mester:
Rental Car Program: To host 
a small number of rental cars 
on campus so that students may 
access them for personal use on 
their own time  at a fair hourly 
rate.
Rental Bike Program: To re
vive the bicycle rental program 
so that students may borrow a 
bike to ride on errands, between 
classes, for exercise, or for other 
purposes.
Sustainability Task Force: To 
establish a student task force that 
would act as consultants to the 
universitys departments  eval
uating their business practices to 
ensure that theyre as green as 
possible.
Gender-Neutral Housing: To 
pilot test a gender-neutral hous
ing policy for certain campus 
housing arrangements.
CarnegieWiki: To establish
a wiki for the Carnegie Mellon 
community.
These are just a sample of things 
Karl and Andrea are working on.

So-called bad economy 
vindicated by raw numbers
___________Benjamin Hackett
No matter what fad third party 
du jour raises its flag calling for 
the disillusioned protest votes of 
the masses, when this years mid
term elections are boiled down 
to basics, it is still a two-horse 
race. Admittedly, the two horses 
are both slightly beaten up and 
wounded. Yet there are still con
siderable differences between 
the rotting equine carcass of the 
formerly proud Democratic Party 
of Kennedy, and the limping, but 
still functioning, trotter of the 
Contract with America Repub
lican Party.
The most breathtaking part of 
voter disillusionment with Re
publicans is this disjointed logic 
proclaimed by many who plan on 
sitting this election out  or even 
worse  voting for the Demo
crats this November. Much of this 
logic hovers around the liberal 
medias establishment and main
tenance of the continual myth of 
a bad economy. Its a myth so 
powerful, it manages to propa
gate itself regardless of what 
the actual numbers indicate. So 
pervasive is the bad economy 
myth that record low unemploy
ment averages, real wage gains, 
historically below-average defi
cits and a booming private sector 
(as indicated by Dow Jones re
cord highs), are swept under the
will argue that Bush and the cur
rent Republican Congress have 
been good on spending (from a 
traditional conservative view
point). That said, the liberal lens 
of the political press pool has 
distortedly reported the budget 
deficits. The opposition would 
have one believe that the current 
budget deficits are a Bush-related 
phenomenon. However, this is 
again another complex distortion 
in the bad economy myth.
Since 1960, the United States 
of America has run a budget 
deficit in 41 of 47 years; that is 87 
percent of the time. Furthermore, 
the average percentage of gross 
domestic product that the budget 
deficit makes up has been lower 
since 2000 than it was during 
the 1980s and 90s. Since 2000, 
the budget deficits have made up 
an average of 1.07 percent of the 
GDP. Contrast that number to the 
greatly proclaimed booms of the 
1980s and 90s, decades where 
the budget deficit made up 3.93 
and 2.16 percent of the GDP, re
spectively. The proclamation of 
crisis-level deficits under Bush, 
as another symptom of a report
edly bad economy, is an added, 
overt distortion in the continued 
sustenance of the bad economy 
myth.
And what about the youth vote? 
How is it possible that students 
can sit in their political science 
classes and hear their collegelevel classmates complaining 
about the myth of the bad econIf the Republicans cannot find a way to shine 
light on the myth of the bad economy, they 
may find themselves waking up on November 
8 and seeing a Speaker Pelosi nameplate.

liberal lie of growing misery and 
poverty.
Republicans do deserve some 
of the blame for the pestilent ex
istence of this myth. GOP shame 
and blame emanates from a strik
ing failure to take credit for siz
able economic gains and create 
political capital from them. Obvi
ously the liberal press will never 
aid an incumbent Republican 
party in achieving said credit, 
but that alone does not serve 
as an excuse for failing to bring 
the message to the grassroots. If 
there was a real understanding 
of the true strength of this cur
rent economy, these midterm 
elections could not possibly track 
as close as they have been.
Numbers are benevolent dogooders, as numbers cannot lie. 
The current unemployment rate 
is 4.6 percent, as per the Septem
ber 2006 numbers. This puts the 
unemployment rate for the cur
rent decade at 5.1 percent. Re
member the glory days of the 90s 
under Clinton, where the econ
omy was booming and the good 
times would never end? The un
employment average for the 90s 
was 5.75 percent, more than half 
a percentage point higher than 
the current decades average. In 
fact, the current decades average 
unemployment rate is lower than 
the averages of the 70s, 80s, and 
90s.
Well, the opposition slyly re
marks, thats fne about the job 
numbers, but lets talk deficits. 
Written by Marshall Roy/Forum Editor, drawn by Diego Bauz/Comics Editor Qkay lets No true Conservative
omy? While the national jobless 
rate hovers at a very low 4.6 per
cent, the unemployment rate for 
college graduates puts that rela
tively low number to shame.
The unemployment rate 
among college graduates is at 
1.8 percent, the lowest in five 
years and the foremost indica
tion of the continuing market 
demand for a college education 
in the workforce. Mike Walden, 
an economist at North Carolina 
State, points out that half of 
the new jobs filled this year by 
people over age 25 were filled 
by people with a college degree, 
even though folks with a college 
degree make up only one third of 
the workforce.
It is crunch time for these 2006 
midterm elections. Republicans 
can and will pick up votes by run
ning on the issues, not by indulg
ing themselves in Democrat-style 
October surprises. Mystifyingly 
absent from the campaigns to 
date is any mention of the cur
rently booming economy. If the 
Republicans cannot find a way to 
shine light on the myth of the bad 
economy, they may find them
selves waking up on November 
8 and seeing a Speaker Pelosi 
nameplate. Let us hope this is 
not the case, as I, for one, like the 
current drapes on Capitol Hill.

Mens soccer drops two games at home
Team records first two losses of the season
by Elizabeth Haldane
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team hosted two Univer
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
matches at Gesling Stadium this 
weekend. The Tartans took on 
the Case Western Reserve Uni
versity Spartans on Friday and 
the University of Rochester Yellowjackets on Sunday, losing to 
both teams. The Tartans overall 
record moves to 10-5 and 3-3 in 
the University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA).
Due to difficult weather con
ditions with constant rain and 
wind chill on Friday, neither the 
Tartans nor the Spartans were 
able to score in the first half. 
However, in the 58th minute, 
Case forward Justin Steggerda 
received a ball from teammate
Kevin Bigart and cranked the ball 
past Carnegie Mellon sophomore 
goalkeeper Matthew Bazin.
A moment later, the Tartans 
were down by two when Bigart 
deflected a corner kick from Case 
forward R. J. French into the back 
of the net. Despite the Tartans 
out-shooting the Spartans 15-
10, Carnegie Mellon was unable 
to capitalize on its chances and 
get past Case goalkeeper Konrad 
Karasek, who stopped five shots 
while Bazin made two saves. The 
Tartans lost 2-0.
With Carnegie Mellons dif
ficulty regrouping from Fridays 
loss and Sundays windy condi
tions, the team struggled to stay 
in the game against Rochester. 
The Tartans fell behind in the 
fourth minute when Rochester 
forward Tyler Green passed the 
ball to midfield teammate Brian 
Tuohy, who shot the ball from 20
yards. The ball hit the inside of 
the right post before it went in.
It was not until the 70th min
ute that the Tartans scored the 
equalizing goal. Carnegie Mel
lon first-year defender Jonathan 
Hall passed a long ball to senior 
forward, Jonathan Browne, who 
capitalized on his opportunity 
and struck the ball into the upper 
corner of the net.
Ten minutes later, Rochester 
midfielder Patrick Ripp, took the 
corner kick that Green tapped 
in behind Carnegie Mellons de
fense. With less than 10 minutes 
left on the clock, the Tartans put 
up a good fight against the Yellowjackets but to no avail, losing 
2-1.
The Tartans once again outshot their opponents 12-11, 
and Bazin made six saves while

Cycling club takes conference title
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Although the Carnegie Mellon 
cycling team is a young, small, 
and underfunded club team, it 
boasts three top Division II (D2) 
riders and a conference cham
pionship title that rivals any of 
the Tartans varsity teams suc
cesses.
In mid-October, the cycling 
team beat out 29 teams to win 
the Eastern Collegiate Cycling 
Conference (ECCC) D2 Moun
tain Bike Championships, hosted 
by the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. The Tartans 
beat out St. Michaels College of 
Burlington, Vt., by three points, 
343-340, to win the title.
The cycling club won three 
races throughout the fall season, 
including the conference cham
pionships, and three Carnegie 
Mellon riders earned individual 
honors. Senior Julie Schonefeld 
was the top womens A D2 moun
tain bike rider. Junior Charlie 
Patterson was the top mens B 
D2 rider, and junior Aaron Hoy 
was the top mens C D2 rider.
The ECCC is divided into Divi
sion I and Division II teams. Any 
school with less than 15,000 stu
dents is considered to be Division
II.
Riders are ranked on competi
tiveness, with A riders being the
most competitive and C riders 
being the least competitive.
The ECCC stretches from 
Maine to Pennsylvania, and 
Carnegie Mellon lies in the south
western corner of the conference 
area. This means that Carnegie 
Mellon riders pile into cars and 
travel up to 13 hours to race.
Heavy recruiting and extra 
funding helped the Carnegie Mel
lon cycling team to go through a 
facelift this year. The team went 
from three riders attending a 
couple events last year to 10 rid
ers attending a half dozen moun
tain biking races this year.
Riders vary in skill level from 
those who have never raced to 
riders who have a lot of racing 
experience. While the team does 
not hold daily practice, it is com
mon for the riders to go on week
end rides together.
The cycling season is divided 
into fall mountain biking and 
spring road racing. There are 
four events in mountain biking: 
cross country (XC), short-track 
cross country (STXC), dual sla
lom (DS), and downhill (DH).
XC is a traditional endurance 
race; riders race from point A to 
point B, with the first rider finish
ing the course winning the race. 
STXC is a track approximately a 
quarter-mile in length through 
the woods; the person who com
pletes the most laps within the 
allotted time, usually 20 to 25
minutes, wins.
DS is a gravity race, set on a 
slalom course with gates and 
jumps similar to slalom skiing. 
DH is an extreme gravity event 
in which riders, outfitted in full 
body armor, take a ski lift to the 
top of a mountain and ride to the 
bottom over three-foot drops.
Most riders either specialize 
in endurance or gravity events, 
although some compete in both. 
The races take place over a 
weekend, with XC and DS events 
on Saturday and STXC and DH 
events on Sunday. There is usu
ally a banquet or party for the 
teams on Saturday night.
Everyones friendly, said 
senior Michael Cruz, the clubs 
president.
There is rivalry, but no ani
mosity between teams, Patter
son added.
The national championships 
this year were held in New Mex
ico. Both Schonefeld and Patter
son qualified, but they did not 
have the funds or transportation 
to attend.
While the ECCC fall season 
has come to a close, riders can 
keep busy throughout the winter 
riding in local races. The spring 
cycling season picks up again in 
March.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 30, 2006THH
World. Series ratings at record-low mark
Doug Fricker
From 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. on 
Sunday, October 22, more 
people watched Desperate 
Housewives than the second 
game of the Major League 
Baseball (MLB) World Series 
between the St. Louis Cardi
nals and the Detroit Tigers.
As a whole, the final round 
of the World Series received 
record-low television ratings 
over the five games played. 
These low ratings reflect that 
baseball is losing some of its 
luster due to the changing in
terests of the American view
ing public.
This years ratings fell short 
of the previously record-low 
television ratings that oc
curred last year when the 
Chicago White Sox swept the 
Houston Astros. Being a Cubs 
fan, I can see why people dont 
watch the White Sox or the 
Cardinals, since rooting for 
either of those teams is like 
sticking your finger in an elec
trical socket  you just dont 
do it.
The St. Louis Cardinals 
game one victory on Fox, Sat
urday night, drew an 8.0 fast 
national rating and 15 share, a 
record low for an opener. The 
national rating is the percent
age, of U.S. television house
holds tuned to a program, 
and each point represents
1,114,000 homes. The share 
is the percentage of television 
sets in use tuned to a specific 
program.
The ratings for the follow
ing four games werent much
better, at 11.5/18, 10.2/17, 
9.4/15, and 8.7/15 for the 
clinching fifth game. When 
the Boston Red Sox swept the 
Cardinals two years ago in the 
World Series, the ratings were 
never below 13.7/24.
St. Louis and Detroit are 
small-market cities, mean
ing that they draw from a 
smaller viewing base than, 
say, New York or Los Angeles. 
This amounts to about 1 mil
lion fewer homes tuning in to 
see their local teams, accord
ing to Fox spokesman Lou 
DErmilio.
But this isnt the end of the 
story. Sure, neither the New 
York Yankees nor the Boston 
Red Sox  two teams that are 
guaranteed television draws
 are playing in the series, 
but the World Series is the 
World Series.
These record-low TV ratings 
show that baseball is slowly 
becoming less and less Amer
icas pastime. People arent as 
likely to sit down and watch 
a three-hour baseball game 
today as they were 20 or even
10 years ago. The recent tech
nological boom plays a role, 
with people now able to check 
scores on their cell phones or 
follow games on the Internet. 
Steroids and their alleged use 
by players might be turning 
away viewers as well.
Nonetheless, MLB is not 
worried about the television 
ratings. Im not overly con
cerned, MLB commissioner 
Bud Selig said in an interview 
last Wednesday with ESPN, 
com. The teams television 
ratings all year have been
r
spectacular. Lets wait until 
the World Series is over. He 
went on to add that baseball 
has agreed to long-term deals 
with Fox and Turner Sports 
amid competition from other 
companies, showing that, as 
he said, people in the televi
sion business like what theyre 
seeing.
The Tigers and Cardinals 
players werent concerned 
about the ratings either. Were 
going for a World Series title. 
Im not worried about the TV 
ratings, Detroit pitcher Justin 
Verlander said in the same in
terview.
The ratings are good in 
Michigan, the ratings are 
good in St. Louis, and theyre 
good in Birmingham, Ala
bama; thats all I care about, 
said Detroit closer Todd Jones, 
who lives in Alabama during 
the off-season.
In the past, poeple watched 
the World Series even when 
they had no connection to 
either of the teams compet
ing. This is certainly not the 
case anymore, with view
ers not seeming to associate 
with the sport of baseball as 
much as a specific team in the 
league. This trend is exposed 
in a World Series like this one 
when two small-market teams 
are competing.
Major League Baseball 
seems content with the low 
ratings, at least for the time 
being. The American public is 
paying less and less attention 
to the World Series, and until 
MLB becomes more desper
ate, the housewives are going 
to continue to reign supreme.
Football team remains undefeated
FOOTBALL, from A12
and Wash. U. combined for 
two touchdowns in the first six 
minutes of the second quarter, 
defense dominated the remain
der of the contest. On the next 
possession, the Tartans forced 
their third three-and-out of the 
half to return the ball to the of
fense.
The defense excelled all day, 
but, late in the first half, it was 
Lackners special teams unit that 
proved instrumental in safe
guarding the 7-7 tie.
When Facemyer misfired on 
a third-and-nine from his own 
16 with less than two minutes 
on the clock, the punt team took 
the field. Senior Matthew Adams 
tried to pin Wash. U. deep enough 
to prevent any chance of a late 
second-quarter score. A five-yard 
running-into-the-kicker penalty, 
however, allowed the Tartans to 
replay the down. Lackner gam
bled and rather than re-kick, the 
Tartans snapped the ball directly 
to the up-back, linebacker James 
Rogers, and the senior charged 
18 yards through the Bear de
fense. The first down allowed 
the offense to run out the clock 
and escape the first half tied at 
seven.
Offensive woes continued into 
the second half for both teams as 
the Tartans only earned one first 
down on their first three posses
sions against a tough Wash. U. 
defense. The Bears also strug
gled to move the chains against 
an equally stout unit. Their first 
three drives of the second half 
followed a familiar recipe: three 
plays, then punt.
It was a defensive struggle on 
both sides, Lackner said about
a unit that allowed just 136 to
tal yards. We had a tough time 
moving the ball against a great 
group and our kids played their 
tail end off too, so it was very 
much so a defensive struggle.
Carnegie Mellons most prom
ising scoring opportunity of the 
second half came after a short 
punt provided great field posi
tion at the Wash. U. 31. The of
fense could not take advantage, 
however, and the Bears blocked 
Greensteins 44-yard field goal 
attempt on the final play of the 
third quarter.
The offenses again traded 
punts during the opening 10 
minutes of the fourth quarter 
until Wash. U. managed one last 
scoring threat. On second down, 
with barely a minute left in regu
lation, McCarthy dropped back 
to pass but Rogers tipped the ball 
at the line of scrimmage and se
nior linebacker Jamie Ploetzner 
hauled it in at the Bear 39.
That was all Rogers. He came 
on the blitz and ended up getting 
a hand on the ball. I give him all 
the credit for that, Ploetzner 
said. I was just concentrating on 
getting the turnover and letting 
our offense have another shot to 
put it in the end zone.
Despite the great field posi
tion supplied by Ploetzners pick, 
Carnegie Mellon could not move 
into field goal range and over
time was needed to determine 
the 2006 UAA champion.
The Tartans, who won the 
ensuing coin toss, elected to pit 
their defense against the ane
mic Bears offense at the start of 
overtime. An early first down did 
not rattle the defense and two of
fensive penalties, as well as a sixyard loss, kept Wash. U.s offense
out of the end zone. On fourthand-12 from the 15, junior Mike 
Elliot lined up for a 32-yard field 
goal but it sailed wide right.
Needing only a field goal to 
clinch the title, the Tartans 
turned to a phase of their game 
plan that had been at the founda
tion of their 7-0 start: the sixth 
ranked running game in Division
III.
Saturdays 126 rushing yards 
fell far short of their gaudy 282 
yards per game average, yet 
when the offense needed to 
shorten the field for Greensteins 
leg, Sivek and the offensive line 
produced, covering 19 yards on 
six consecutive carries.
I think thats a testament to 
the character of the guys I play 
with on offense, senior right 
guard J.P. White said. In that 
huddle there was definitely a 
sense of urgency in everybodys 
eyes. There wasnt anyone in that 
huddle that was going to step 
down and settle for anything less 
than three points.
Siveks hard running brought 
the Tartans closer and closer to 
both the Bears end zone and the 
programs seventh UAA title. Fi
nally, on fourth-and-one from 
the three, Greenstein was called 
on to bring home the Tartan vic
tory. The seniors 22-yard field 
goal cleared the uprights and 
closed out another chapter in the 
teams storied 2006 season.
It has been our goal every 
year to win the UAA, said Green
stein, who also nailed the gamewinner in last seasons victory 
over Case Western Reserve Uni
versity. When you think about it 
coming down to a field goal and 
being able to kick it, its a special 
feeling.Swimming wins at Westminster

won the 200-yard freestyle with 
a time of 1:47.23.
The greatest strength of the 
mens team this year is its depth, 
Douglass said. We were able to 
sweep Clarion in multiple events, 
and if we didnt win an event our 
depth helped us to keep the score 
close.
First-year divers Matt Kuhn 
and Joe Kopko placed second and 
third in both the one-meter and 
three-meter dives. The Carnegie 
Mellon A team of Papa, Hender
son, Bailey, and Krzeminski won 
the 200-yard freestyle relay with 
a time of 1:27.67.
Its not easy swimming two 
meets on back-to-back days, 
Douglass said. But the team was 
able to maintain its intensity dur
ing both meets and was able to 
swim very well on both days.

as a team, and it really paid off today, all the way 
through, when you look at the forwards [and] what 
they were doing all the way back to the defenders. 
A lot of times when you talk about defense you just 
think about the back four, but really its a team con

Against Rochester on Sunday, the Tartans gave 
up an early goal in the eighth minute when Yellowjacket defender Stephanie Klenotich headed in 
a corner kick from midfielder Laura Morrison. The 
header took a high bounce over the outstretched 
hands of sophomore goalkeeper Christie Adams 
and went into the net.
Rochester added an insurance goal in the 58th 
minute when forward Emily Urbanczyk received 
a cross from midfielder Anne McMahon and sub
sequently blasted a shot past Adams to make the 
score 2-0 in favor of the Yellowjackets.
The Tartans kept their composure. Sophomore 
defender Sarah DeWath netted her first goal of her 
career in the 61st minute to cut the Tartan deficit 
to one. DeWath collected the rebound off a blocked 
shot and fired it into the net from around 10 yards 
out.
Rose was Carnegie Mellons last hope, but her 
free kick from around 25 yards out with six seconds 
left was saved by Rochester goalie Molly Leitch.
Before the hard-fought loss to Rochester, the Tar

Tartan football defeats Bears to win conference championship
by Adam Lazarus
Staffwriter
The Tartans left Francis Field 
in St. Louis Saturday afternoon 
with more than just a conference 
title in hand. By surviving a 10-7 
overtime war of attrition against 
Washington University (Mo.), 
the newly crowned University
Athletic Association (UAA) vic
tors revealed the type of resolve 
and grit that defines champion
ship teams.
Carnegie Mellon  who a 
week ago defeated last years 
UAA title holders, the University 
of Chicago, 27-0  had ctuised 
to a 7-0 mark, averaging a 22- 
point average margin of victory. 
With this seasons conference
supremacy at stake for both 
schools, however, Wash. U. tested 
the Tartans unlike any other op
ponent all season.
I think.it says a lot about our 
character, head coach Rich 
Lackner said. What I always say 
and what a lot of coaches say  
its kind of a cliche, but  good 
teams find a way to win.
As would be the theme all day,
both defenses took center stage 
from the games outset. The Tar
tans (8-0, 3-0) and Bears (5-4, 
2-1) each forced punts on their 
opponents opening possession. 
Carnegie Mellon drew first blood 
early in the second quarter when 
quarterback Doug Facemyer 
capped a 10-play, 44-yard drive 
with his first touchdown run 
of the season. The sophomore,
starting his second straight game 
for an injured Kevin Mulkern, 
found the end zone by sprinting 
right and diving for the near py
lon. Senior kicker Nat Greenstein 
booted the extra point and Carn
egie Mellon owned a 7-0 lead.
Wash. U., also undefeated in 
conference play and in line for 
the UAA title with a victory Sat
urday, answered the score two
drives later off the arm of their 
senior quarterback. Pat McCar
thy, who completed all three of 
his passes during a four-play, 40- 
yard march, found senior wide 
receiver Nick Lizanich on a playaction pass that covered 27 yards 
for the Bears first points.

goalie Kirsten McClain was un
able to control the ball. Stever 
found the ball near the right post, 
turned, and had her shot blocked 
by two Case defenders. She col
lected the rebound and turned 
and passed back to the center of 
the box to Rose, who one-timed 
the ball into the empty left side 
of the net.
On the goal, we had really 
good teamwork, Rose said. 
Casey Garth played a really 
nice pass into the box, and Kasey 
Stever worked really hard and 
passed back to me, and I kicked 
it in.
Going into the game we 
wanted to come out and impose 
our style of play and our game to 
them, assistant coach Tony Mo
hammed said. It was an impor
tant game when you talk about 
UAAs. We did a lot of research in 
terms of what type of team Case 
was like, who their most danger
ous players were, their style of 
play, things like that, so we were 
well prepared. We did well to 
come out and impose ourselves.

Although their season is 
coming to an end, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens soccer team has 
played well of late. Their threegame winning streak has been
fueled by incredible team play 
and individual performances.
Last week sophomore forward 
Abby Coffin recorded her first 
hat trick in a game against Penn 
State-Behrend and received 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) honors as womens 
soccer Athlete of the Week. She 
sat down with The Tartan to 
discuss her success.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing soccer? How did you get 
into the sport?
Coffin: I was four when I 
started playing. My dad was 
the coach, so that really drew 
me into the game. I started 
playing on a YMCA team, then 
eventually played for a club and 
my high school.
T: Did you always know you 
would play soccer in college?
C: I always wanted to play 
soccer in college: I just never 
knew where until later on in 
high school when I decided that 
academics were much more 
important. This is why I came to 
CMU, where I knew I would play 
great soccer and still have high 
academic standards for myself.
T: How do you handle 
balancing your academics with 
soccer?
C: Managing soccer and 
school was never difficult until 
I came to CMU. I, as well as the 
other girls on the team, do really 
well managing the work and 
putting in the 10 to 12 hours 
of practice a week and one to 
two games a week schedule. 
I actually seem to feel and 
perform better in school during 
soccer season.
T: The team has to travel a lot 
during the season  any place 
in particular you have really 
liked?
C: I am a sophomore, and so 
far we have traveled to Boston to 
play Brandeis, New York to play 
New York University and the 
University of Rochester, Atlanta 
to play Emory, Cleveland to 
play Case Western Reserve, 
Chicago to play the University 
of Chicago, and St. Louis to play 
Washington University. So far, I 
enjoyed Boston the most. It is a 
great city and I had a lot of fun 
with the team on that trip.
T: Is there anything in
particular you attribute your 
success to? *
C: Well, I can give some credit 
to the fact that I work really 
hard at pracdces, but honestly, 
other than that, winning soccer 
games and playing well is a team 
achievement.
Without everyone out there 
playing well, theres not much 
we can do. So if anything, being 
part of a really great team, and 
all of us really being able to 
work together.
Ti What accomplishments are 
you most proud of?
C: When I played club, we 
won the state championship 
eight years in a row; last year 
I was honored as UAA Rookie 
of the Year; and [I was] named 
All-UAA, which are all things I 
am really proud of.
Recognition and awards like 
that are always really cool. They 
really make you want to play 
harder.
T: Any goals left for the 
remainder of the soccer season?
C: Well, the team would like 
to finish the season hard, and 
win out the rest of the season.
Volleyball primed for 
a strong UAA finish

Staffwriter
With two wins last Saturday 
at the Waynesburg College Quad 
Tournament, the Carnegie Mel
lon womens volleyball team im
proved its record to 18-12 head
ing into the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Champion
ships. The championships will 
be held at Carnegie Mellon on 
Friday and Saturday.
The Tartans defeated Bethany 
College 30-16,30-17, and 30-24 
in their first match at Waynes
burg and followed that up with 
a 30-19, 30-21, and 30-21 win 
against Thiel College.
The Tartans, 11-3 in their 
last 14 matches, benefited from 
strong play from first-year Jes
sica Brackin, who led the team 
with 14 kills against Bethany 
and added four block assists in 
the win. Brackin posted a careerhigh nine total blocks (seven 
block assists) in the win against 
Thiel.
Senior outside hitter Amanda 
Bradford made her presence felt 
in both games as she collected 
seven digs against Bethany and 
13 digs, 10 kills, and five total 
blocks versus Thiel. Senior right 
side Catie Fisher and junior mid
dle hitter Abbie Toney contrib
uted 10 and nine kills, respec
tively, against Bethany.
Defensively against Bethany, 
senior libero Kat Fox recorded
15 digs, and the tandem of senior 
setter Brea Carlock and first-year 
setter Samantha Carter recorded 
26 and 20 assists apiece in the 
win against Bethany.
We persisted all the way 
to the end, senior defensive 
specialist/setter Alex Gutschick 
said. We were more consistent 
than we have ever been this 
weekend.
Toney added, The competi
tion wasnt as tough as we were 
hoping for. That said, getting a 
few games in helps us relax and 
loosen up.
The Tartans went 3-3 in the 
regular season against UAA op
ponents, losing to second-ranked 
Washington (Mo.) University, 
number-13-ranked Emory Uni
versity, and number-15-ranked 
New York University. Their UAA 
victories came against Uni
versity of Rochester, Brandeis 
University, and Case Western 
Reserve University.
Having previously played the 
teams in the UAA is a doubleedged sword, Toney said. You 
can say that it gives us confi
dence about what we are going 
up against, but its a disadvan
tage that our competitors know 
our weaknesses and can expose 
them.
The UAA Championships will 
begin at 9 a.m. Friday in the 
University Center gym with the 
championship game to be played 
at 4 p.m. Saturday afternoon in 
Skibo Gym.
Runners race in St. Louis
by Sam Kim
Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the mens and 
womens cross country teams 
raced at the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Champion
ships at Washington University 
in St. Louis. Out of the eight con
ference teams, the Tartan men 
placed fourth overall, while the 
women finished sixth.
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
team finished with 104 points, 
behind New York University 
(NYU), Washington University, 
and Brandeis University. NYU 
won the mens championship 
with 25 points. Washington and 
Brandeis tied for second place 
with 86 points.
The womens team finished in 
sixth place with 157 points. Case 
Western Reserve University up
set the heavily-favored thirdranked Washington University 
to win the team title with 39 
points.
Mens cross country
In the 8K race, sophomore 
Brian Harvey once again led the 
team, finishing fifth overall with 
a time of 25:39.74. Behind Har
vey, sophomore Breck Fresen 
finished 13th overall with a time 
of 26:12.32.
We flew out of Pittsburgh at 
8:55 a.m. Friday morning, which 
meant we had to wake up around 
6 a.m. that morning, said Har
vey. We then had a short layover 
in Chicagos Midway Airport and 
then flew to St. Louis. Traveling 
the day before a meet is defi
nitely not ideal and can take a lot 
off your legs for the race.
First-year Dario Donatelli and 
senior captain Geoff Misek fin
ished third and fourth for the 
Tartans with times of 26:35.20 
and 26:35.47, respectively.
Junior Jason Jura finished 
fifth for Carnegie Mellon with 
a time of 26:47.13. Sophomores 
Mike Haley and Ryan Anderson
finished with times of 26:51.20 
and 26:56.45, respectively, to 
round out the top seven.
Prior to the race, the Tartans 
were ranked 19th in Division III 
and were ranked to finish sec
ond in the UAA championships. 
Overall, we were not happy 
with our teams performance 
in the race, Harvey said. We 
dont like to make excuses as to 
why we didnt run as well as we 
would have liked.
The mens team will return to 
Waynesburg on Saturday, No
vember 11, to compete in the 
NCAA Division III Mideast Re
gional.
Womens cross country
Two first-years, Danielle Sedlack and Hallie Espel, led the 
Tartans, finishing 20th and 25th 
overall with times of 23:58.03 
and 24:07.53, respectively.
Being in St. Louis after the 
Cardinals won the World Series 
was such an amazing experi
ence, Sedlack said. People 
were chanting, dancing, drink
ing, and celebrating through the 
streets. For me, the World Series 
experience made me even more 
excited for my run the next day.
Sophomore Carolyn Clayton 
and senior Jerri Castillo finished 
third and fourth for the team, 
crossing the line at 24:38.41 and 
24:41.39, respectively.
Finishing fifth and sixth for 
the team, junior Carrie Kmetzo 
and first-year Anna Lenhart ran 
times of 25:12.45 and 25:36.90, 
respectively. Sophomore Chrissy 
Krutz rounded out the top seven 
with a time of 25:38.47.
All of the top seven runners 
for the womens team ran per
sonal best times in the 6K race. 
We thought that the partying 
by the Cards fans would keep us 
up at night, but it didnt seem to 
cause any devastating effect, 
said Sedlack.
The womens team will join 
the mens team at Waynesburg 
on Saturday, November 11.

Obamas yfIa.ng, - MpV
Senators new book a friendly political readDid you know?
The conventional wisdom in America is that 
our politicians lie. Barack Obama's new book, 
however, is showing that honesty can get you 
places in American politics.
What makes Obama, 45, a junior Senator from 
Illinois, stand out is his candidness about 
American politics in his book Audacity of Hope. 
He is not an undercover reporter from Fox News 
or a defeated and bitter ex-candidate; he is a 
law-making, bill-voting U.S. Senator who holds 
nothing back in his writing. Obama reveals 
facts and details: for example, that the Bush 
administrations $522 billion defense budget is 
more than the amount of the next 30 highestspending countries combined.
Obama's book is not written to expose any 
particular politician or political party; he says 
the gap between Republicans and Democrats 
has been present throughout dozens of 
administrations and is not truly the problem 
today. Obama claims the problem is the gap 
between the magnitude of our challenges and the 
smallness of our politics  the ease with which 
we are distracted by the petty and trivial, our 
chronic avoidance of tough decisions, and our 
seeming inability to build a working consensus to 
tackle any big problem.
Honesty is not the only thing about this book that 
is catching the attention of American readers. 
Obama writes with a sincerity and modesty 
that allow him to present his sensible solutions 
to some of the United States biggest issues 
without alienating any particular political party. 
This is not to say that Obama isnt a full-blooded 
Democrat, but he has a way of presenting the 
ideas of staunchly conservative Republicans and 
then gently exposing and denouncing each of 
their ideals. He doesnt even bash Bush, per se, 
when he writes, "I support Bush the person but 
not his ideas."
Within his solutions, he defends the current 
position of Democrats but states that they must 
become a party of action and not reaction if 
they want to win elections. A constant game 
of defense bereft of the energy and new ideas 
needed to address the changing circumstances of 
globalization or a stubbornly isolated inner city," 
Obama states, is doing nothing to advance the 
ideology of their party.
Perhaps the most enticing aspect of The 
Audacity of Hope is the author himself. The 
biracial, bi-continental Obama lived in both 
Hawaii and Indonesia before becoming a citizen 
of Chicago. He hardly knew his father, who 
divorced his mother when Obama was 2; his 
mother remarried, but that relationship failed as
well. He ended up being raised by his mother and 
her parents in Chicago.
Born to a white mother and a black father, 
Obama's childhood was similar to many AfricanAmerican children growing up in American cities 
and suburbs. Through his hard work, supportive 
household, and wry intelligence, he was able to 
rise above the life that statistics say he should 
have had. Unfortunately, not all people growing 
up in similar neighborhoods have held such high 
standards for themselves  Obama reports in 
his book that since 1950, the marriage rate for 
black women has plummeted from 62 percent to 
36 percent, and the number of African-American 
children living with two married parents dropped 
by half, leaving 54 percent in single parent 
households. These statistics are both striking 
and scary; few politicians can personally relate 
to such issues that so desperately need to be 
addressed.
For the past four months Pennsylvanians have 
been caught in the crossfire of Rick Santorum's 
satirical TV ads aimed at Robert Casey Jr., 
attacking his competency and inability to 
maintain a job, and Caseys rebuttal disclosing 
Santorums vote to raise his own salary but not 
the minimum wage, his wish to privatize social 
security, and the Pennsylvania funds he used to 
home-school his children. In light of Obamas 
popularity, it is refreshing to see that such 
antagonistic campaigning is truly unnecessary 
when you believe in your ideas and what your 
campaign stands for. Obamas book lays out 
his thoughts, opinions, and sensible solutions to 
debates about values, religion, economics, war, 
and globalization. His ability to see life and the 
problems of the people through his own eyes 
is what makes him not just a politician but an 
American.

The class of 1906 laid down the law with a series of 
proclamations aimed at Plebes (first-year students). 
The rules stated that first-years were not permitted to 
wear plaid before Easter or smoke inside buildings. 
Also, Plebes were not allowed to pour hot metal upon 
themselves as the odor of burning flesh is disagreeable 
to the juniors." How thoughtful.
The Tartan had its greatest readership in years, or at least 
it seemed that way. Copies of the paper disappeared 
from the stands almost immediately. Unfortunately, it 
wasnt the result of student interest. It turned out that 
members of a political party were stealing the papers to 
protest a condemning article. When caught in the act, 
a fight broke out, leaving several students bruised. Talk 
about a political bash!
A graffiti artist endeavored to spread the word of his 
abstract religion by writing in magic marker the words 
ENO is GOD on sidewalks, wheel-chair ramps, and 
bulletin boards across campus. Considering Eno 
was referencing Brian Eno, the man who created The 
Microsoft Sound, its no wonder a Carnegie Mellon 
student would worship him. Another example of art 
imitating life... imitating computers.
As fall arrived, students were beginning to feel the 
negative effects of their daily habits. According to Anita 
Barkin, director of Health Services, the worst problems 
for students were sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, 
upper respiratory infections, and stress. The director 
was correct, but she missed one fact: At Carnegie 
Mellon, students face health issues related to sleeping 
infrequently, feeling tense, and eating disappointing food 
alt year round, not just in the fall.
A disgruntled first-year wrote an angry letter to The 
Tartans editorial board about the Freshman Chemistry 
Laboratory, a grueling three-hour class required of all CfT 
students. Horrors of the course include unreasonable 
boredom and mandatory goggle-wearing, a policy 
which, according to the writer, "makes us look worse 
than CITers usually do." Fellow CIT students probably 
would have joined him and revolted  if only they hadnt 
felt so revolting.
Two men in their 20s who said they were alumni 
knocked on the door of a Roselawn Terrace apartment. 
They told the resident they had left something inside 
one of the apartments bedroom walls. They requested 
to be let inside, but the student refused and later left his 
apartment. Upon his return, the student discovered that 
his window screen had been torn out and that intruders 
had knocked a hole in the wall, most likely to retrieve 
their item. $10 says it was a bagpipe.

Eliot Fisk: Teaching students through experience
Composer stresses importance of the relationship between students and professionals
Michael Menchaca | Art Staff
Grammy-nominated classical guitarist Eliot Fisk spoke Friday 
afternoon at Carnegie Mellon as part of the School of Music's 
new Charles Boyd Master Class Series. Addressing about two 
dozen faculty, composers, and guitar students, Fisk spoke 
about the relationship between performers and composers, 
and about issues in classical music.
Fisk has been called an innovative performer for contributing 
to the guitar repertory. In addition to his own guitar 
transcriptions of pieces such as Paganini's 24 caprices for solo 
violin and various pieces of J.S. Bach, Fisk has worked with 
many notable composers, including Luciano Berio (1925 
2003), George Rochberg, and Robert Beaser. Berio's Sequenza 
XI for guitar was written for Fisk, who helped Berio come up 
with effective new techniques for the guitar.
Fisk has also worked with Leonardo Balada, a composer on 
Carnegie Mellons faculty. Fisk, in collaboration with the Miro 
Quartet, will play the Pittsburgh premiere of Balada's quintet 
for guitar and strings, Caprichos No. 1, when the Pittsburgh 
Chamber Music Societys 2006-2007 concert season opens 
tonight at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Hall. During the lecture Friday, 
Fisk played passages of Balada's quintet and pointed out 
some of the changes that were made to make passages more 
effective. Fisk was excited about Baladas piece, describing 
it as "something new for music, and something new for the 
guitar.
Fisk encouraged young composers to work with performers 
and vice versa in order to write better for particular 
instruments. "I think its something important to meet up with 
young performers, even during school, who need to work with 
composers and start this dialogue from the beginning," he 
said. I'd like to see more interdisciplinary activity, too."
Fisk also told composers that they need to be willing to 
work with performers and accept changes. He said, Music 
should not become ossified; it should not be written in stone. 
There should be a process of creative reinterpretation [by the 
performer].
Fisk also addressed an issue important to all fields: avoiding 
specialization to the point where you lose touch with the 
public. Moses went up the mountain, but he came back 
down, too," he said. "Studying music, of course you need your 
chops, but once you achieve mastery, you need to go out and 
communicate it. Go outside the family of musicians and reach 
out."
Fisk takes his own advice. According to a 2000 Cape Cod 
Times article, Fisk has made it a point to present programs 
in inner-city and out-of-the-way public schools, prisons, and 
senior centers."
Fisk himself is not a stereotypical self-absorbed, 
internationally-famous star. The lecture and subsequent 
discussion demonstrated that he is a very down-to-earth, 
accessible, and passionate person with unwavering faith in
the power of music. As far as Im concerned, music relates to 
everything," he said. Music teaches us things we need to be 
a multiethnic democracy.
Fisk also teaches. According to his biography on www. 
eIiotiisk.com, he teaches in five different languages at 
Mozarteum University in Salzburg, Austria, and at the New 
England Conservatory in Boston, Mass.
Tonight's concert features an all-Spanish program. Up until 
the 20th century, the major centers of classical music were 
Italy, Germany, Austria, and to a smaller extent France and 
England.
No country anymore has hegemony of composers. There 
are many fine Chinese composers out there today, Fisk 
said. Today, various cultures have taken up classical music, 
making it their own. Composers in Ireland are very active, 
for example. Rather than simply composing in the classical 
style, however, they are trying to synthesize Irish music and 
classical music.
Baladas, Caprichos No. 1 makes use of Andalusian folk tunes. 
Fisk was excited about how the advent of technology and the 
Internet have affected modern composers: Were so opened 
up to the folk musics of the world. And with the Internet, you 
can download information that it wouldve taken a lifetime 
to gather before. We have so many wonderful sources of 
creativity," he said.
The opening of the Pittsburgh Chamber Music Societys 
concert season tonight will be very special. This will be the 
first time that Balada's quintet is performed in Pittsburgh. The 
program features Spanish composers; Juan Arriaga (1806- 
1826) was a child prodigy who died before he even reached 
the age of most college sophomores. The Miro Quartet will 
play his Quartet No. 3 in E-flat major.
Opening night of the Pittsburgh Chamber Music Society's 
2006-2007 concert season is tonight at 8 p.m. at Carnegie 
Hall in Oakland. The Miro Quartet and Eliot Fisk will play 
works by Arriaga, Albeniz, Balada, Boccherini, and Paganini. 
Tickets are $10 with a CMU ID. Join the musicians and WQED 
personality Jim Cunningham for a fun and informative pre
concert discussion at 7 p.m.

Big Als Metal Shop
The second conning of W. Axl Rose
Yesterday's got nothing for me..."
A few weeks ago, I spoke of a genius who recognized 
the tribal African roots of metal and reintroduced them 
to the world. But a decade before Max Cavalera, a 
skinny redhead from the jungle of L.A.s Sunset Strip, 
Axl Rose, redefined the notion of a frontman for my 
generation. Part shaman, enigmatic, and certainly 
polemic, Axl was the asshole we all wanted to be. Like 
Jim Morrison before him, Axl could connect with his 
audience in such a primal way that marketers today can 
only salivate at the thought.
Before we see Chinese Democracy, the oft-delayed new 
album from Axl and his boys in Guns N Roses may 
be released (the word on the street  if you believe 
such things  is this month), warranting a better look 
at Axl Rose. The late 80s to early 90s were (for those 
who missed it) hard  recession, race riots, the first 
Gulf War, and the advent of cable news showed us 
all how inhumane we really could be. In between the 
horror shown on news stations, the go-to guy for public 
enemy number one seemed to be our boy Axl. Everyone, 
including my father, knew who this man was. I think he 
still does, actually  but more on that later.
The notion of danger and rebellion that Axl embodied 
for us was genuinely appreciated. It never came across 
as fake or forced. Think of it this way  you know the 
guy that you really hate, the one who tries so hard to 
seem sincere that he comes across as being insincere? 
Well, b(l)ands today like Green Day and the Dixie Chicks 
strike that chord in me. I mean really, do you have to go 
to London to tell everyone you hate Bush? Come back 
to Texas and do that if you want my respect. Keep your 
fans waiting for three hours before you come on stage 
if you have to, but come out and tell us the truth in the 
Midwest before anywhere else. Axl never hesitated to 
tell anyone at any time what he felt.
In fact, the best part of a Guns N Roses show was 
the between-song rants. Who would get called out 
next? The cops? Probably. Magazine editors, journos, 
city councilmen, all were on his s**t-list. Public beefs 
between rappers may be de rigeur now in the hip-hop 
world, but give credit where credit is due: Axl Rose did 
that ages ago  check out Get In The Ring on Use 
Your Eusion II. Unruly, unappreciative fans were not 
spared his anger either  throw something or take a 
picture and youd be lucky to have the concert stopped.
That leads to the second half of his allure  not just 
the fact that hed call people out, but that Axl would do 
it to see how the people would respond. As powerless 
teenagers, we had no idea how the system was set up, 
why people were in power, or how they got there in the 
first place. All we knew was that in the grand scheme 
of things, we didn't matter; and the only thing that 
mattered to us was rock. If some people were called 
out, it showed us that they were responsible for their 
actions. Pushing that boundary, as Morrison did when 
he "exposed himself' in Miami a generation before, 
is how we learned what society was built on. In other 
words, maintaining the status quo.
It was that explosiveness that initially prevented 
me from being allowed to taste the fruits of teenage 
rebellion live in Vancouver. Having seen the wreckage 
in Montreal, and probably having heard whispers of 
St. Louis, my dad forbade me to hear Axl in person. Of 
course, like any good Pops, he relented and bought me 
a ticket to my first real show. Walking to the cavernous 
B.C. Place stadium, nothing on the inside could match 
the scene outside, I thought. Bacchanalian debauchery 
at its finest  perhaps exactly what a young man needs 
to start his travels down that path. What I saw there 
13 years ago set the standard for showmanship and 
stimulation for any show I see today.
And speaking of today, as the world waits to see 
what Axl Rose has been working on in those 13 years, 
the traits of that confrontational genius is still there.
The danger is ever-present, or so it would seem. 
Ironically, there was a riot at a Guns N' Roses concert 
in Vancouver, but that was only four years ago when 
promoters pulled the plug on what would have been 
Roses return to North American touring. In these last 
five years, some new material has been played live; 
some yawn-inducing ("Silkworms"), some stellar (The 
Blues, "There Was A Time") and of course, some 
downloaded. The mystery of who leaked tracks off 
the new album, and the response that Rose's lawyers 
would have, fascinated and engaged the music press 
and public in a way I haven't seen in the last decade. 
Could it be a viral campaign to get people agitated over 
a new Guns N Roses album? An insider who just had to 
remind us of this mans talent? Nah, just another day in 
the life of one of rocks greatest frontmen.
Before I go, I want to thank my dad for (unwittingly) 
getting me into this music. Your love and patience is 
what has got me here today.
Love ya, Pops.

On sampling
Intellectual property (IP) law has become an increasingly important 
part of everyday American dialogue and culture during the last 20 
years. Piracy in the 80s, via tape trading, evolved first to Napster and 
then to todays BitTorrent. Laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act and technologies like digital rights management keep up the 
debate about what we can and cannot do with creative works.
Probably the most interesting debate related to IP is the issue of 
sampling, re-using pieces of existing songs to make new songs. This 
has been revisited lately with artists like DJ Danger Mouse (now part 
of Gnarls Barkley) bringing the mash-up into mainstream cultural 
awareness, and artists like Pittsburghs Girl Talk having to release 
their popular sample-based music on smaller labels like Illegal Art 
because of problems with getting permission to use the samples 
used to make it. However, this is just a new dance-based angle on a 
much older issue.
NegatMand is another band dealing with sampling legality. Using a 
style often termed "piunderphonics" (a term coined by John Oswald, 
originator of the technique), they use samples in a sort of collage 
to create their pieces. Sound clips, including outtakes from radio 
broadcasts, education films, and news reports, are used without any 
other adornment and mashed together.
Their best-known release is U2, a record released in 1991 parodying 
U2s ! Still Havent Found What Im Looking For and Americas Top 
40 host Casey Kasem. This album includes extensive samples of U2 
and Kasem, over which NegatMand placed samples of childrens 
shows and themselves playing kazoos. Naturally, Island Records 
(U2s label) sued, claiming copyright infringement and intentional, 
deliberate confusion of U2 fans. NegatMand lost, and U2 is still illegal 
for sale in the U.S. (but it is on http://www.negativland.eom/i.
They later rereleased these tracks on 2001 s bootleg These Guys 
Are From England And Who Gives A Shit, with more political songs 
containing samples saying copying is a criminal act, theyre trying 
to target Island Records, even if you too have done nothing wrong, 
oh, please dont sue us, we're really sorry about this, and others, 
highlighting the issue at hand quite explicitly and making an impas
sioned plea for relaxed copyright law. In their own" words: Can't 
be blase about it... it might be the music business, but that doesnt 
mean it isnt dangerous.
NegatMand is playing at the Keity-Strayhorn theater at 8 p.m. Tuesday.

Ah, the music of Christians and demons
Detholz! plays to a diverse audience
Described as "nerdy and spazzy by The Onion, Detholz!
 pronounced "Death Holes"  was formed at Wheaton 
College, a conservative evangelical school from which the 
band's members were later expelled, outside Chicago in 1996. 
Jim Cooper, guitarist and frontman, said, While we were all 
attending the Christian university, we became increasingly 
aware that our faith had a lot of holes. We formed this band to 
blow off some steam. Why were they expelled? According to 
Cooper, they were very naughty boys.
What started as throwaway surf rock soon evolved into a 
prog rock/new wave sound. Cooper and guitarist Karl Doerfer 
have been involved since the band's inception, and the 
other members joined in 1999. Despite the relatively long run 
of the band, Cooper said that the project has always been 
interesting, growing, and evolving  which is why there has 
been little turnover and no problems staying together.
Although most frequently compared to Devo and The 
Talking Heads, Cooper considers the band to be a "pastiche 
of a few different sources." Since most of the band met in 
a music conservatory, the members all happen to be selfproclaimed classical nerds. Cooper said that they've tried to 
cram as many influences as possible into any given song, 
especially with songwriting, where we borrow a lot from the 
songwriting of other bands  like repetition and minimalism.
I appreciate David Byrne and The Residents as songwriting 
influences  particularly The Residents' album The King and 
I"
Labeled as both Christian and Satanic by their fans, 
detractors, and the media, the groups music is a blend 
of irreverence and appreciation for members evangelical 
upbringings. The band's MySpace profile proclaims that 
the result is something that has consistently defied easy 
categorization and always produced the strongest of 
reactions, including accusations and threats of arrest for
dollarmovie
'Satanic Worship,' prayer circles at shows both for and against 
the band, and heated (sometimes physical) exchanges pitting 
fans versus detractors (and sometimes fans versus fans)."
Cooper attributes the groups spiritual affiliations, or lack 
thereof, to growing up in conservative evangelical Christian 
communities. However, Cooper said, "[Our agenda is to] 
humanize evangelical Christianity for those growing up 
outside it, based on our own personal experiences. However, 
the religions practiced by the band range from atheism to 
devout Christianity. Since they've been given a Christian 
label by the media, you'd think that their detractors are nonChristians. However, devout evangelical Christians believe 
that Detholz! is not toeing the party line. Cooper said, Now 
evangelicals are running the country, which is a nightmare. 
People who peg us as a Christian rock band have their own 
agenda, and we don't affiliate with any religion. We find it 
nauseating being pigeonholed."
According to the bands Wikipedia page, One distinguishing 
feature of the band is the idiosyncratic nature of their lyrics 
that have  and are often critical of  religious (mostly 
Protestant evangelical Christian) themes and reference 
a wide variety of topics including artificial intelligence, 
psychoanalysis, televangelism, and Mars."
The band is also featured in the documentary Why Should the 
Devil Have All the Good Music? about Christian rock, because 
.of the diverse bands they play with. According to Cooper,
"The story behind that was that we bamboozled them into 
letting us play the Cornerstone Festival [a Christian music 
festival] in order to get money and to exorcise all the personal 
demons. It ended up being a humbling experience because 
the kids were really challenged by our performance. Then we 
played with Pansy Division, a queercore punk band, and the 
producers of the documentary asked why a Cornerstone band 
would ever play with an openly gay group.
Detholz! has performed and toured with bands like Radio 4, 
Electric Six, Wilco, and Weird War. While partying with Weird 
War in Oslo was incredibly memorable, Cooper said, the Wilco 
shows were the biggest. Cooper described Wilco as very 
down to earth and friendly. We're still pretty close to them. 
Last year we had a heckler at the 9:30 Club [in Washington, 
D.C.] and at least 25 percent of the audience hated us. I was 
so nervous and shaking, but I finally just let loose and gave 
[the heckler] the finger. Then Jeff Tweedy [Wilcos frontman] 
ran up to us and gave us huge bear hugs. We'll be playing 
more shows with Wilco in Chicago in the future.
Detholz! 's second album will be released on October 31. This 
album has been two years in the making, so I never want 
to hear any of those songs ever again," Cooper joked. The 
reviews have started to roll in and most of them have been 
positive.
Cooper couldn't be more content with where the group is 
now. It has become a close-knit community of friends. It pays 
for itself and we dont need to dig into our pockets for it, he 
said. We get to play with Weird War and Wilco. Chicago's a 
great pop music town and we all feel very privileged to be a 
part of the music scene. Were content.... We have delusions 
of grandeur."
To Cooper, it has become more about the community around 
the band than the band itself. The band used to be the center 
of everyone's attention but is now part of the amalgam that 
is the Chicago musical community. And Detholz! 's future 
plans? Finishing the tour, with a stop at Carnegie Mellon's 
Underground on November 4, celebrating the release of its 
second album, and heading back to the studio to begin its 
third.

A documentary about two refugees

in hopes of a better life. A beautiful 
documentary and a startling look 
at life, it can only show a part of 
the large story it tries to cover. Still, 
the contrast between the civil war 
life of Sudan and the alienated life 
of suburban America makes this a 
must-see movie. Just think, if you

Double the design
Online or off, good sales depend on it
Last week, two lectures had the sarrie bottom line: Design 
matters. Wednesday, in Newell-Simon Hall, the HumanCpmputer Interaction Institute hosted Jared M. Spool, a 
founder at the research and consulting design firm User 
Interface Engineering. Spool used examples from the Internet 
on how (and how not) to design a website.
Spools lecture, titled "The Dawning of the Age of 
Experience," cited airline fare-restriction agreements as 
examples of poor usability. Such agreements are written in 
a language difficult for even a lawyer to understand. In the 
case of Southwest Airlines' policy, Spool noted, the entire 
document is condensed into three confusing paragraphs. 
Using Netflix as an example, Spool noted how good design 
is essentially invisible: If we succeed, no one notices," he 
explained. Following user recommendations, the company has 
increased its websites usability by implementing a system 
featuring user preferences and movie taste correlations.
Spool concluded his lecture with some lessons he has learned 
from experience. He recommended a multidisciplinary 
approach, where multiple talents collaborate during the 
production process. Communication is key, said Spool; its 
important to have an immediate customer feedback loop, 
which can be used to review incremental design decisions.
Lira Nikolovska spoke Thursday in a lecture hosted by 
the School of Design. Nikolovska, who holds a Ph.D. from 
the design and computation program at MITs School of 
Architecture, focused on the importance of furniture design 
in her talk, "Augmenting Furniture With Technologies." 
Stressing the significance of her field, Nikolovska noted a 1969 
negotiation between Vietnam and the United States that was 
deadlocked for 10 weeks over the shape of the table.
Like Spool, Nikolovska spoke about culture-specific elements 
of her field. She told of an English factory owner in India who
had tables installed on the workshop floor after watching his 
employees work on the ground. The next day his employees 
were simply sitting cross-legged on the tables.
When new technology appears on the market, said 
Nikolovska, it is initially made to look like a piece of existing 
furniture. As consumers become accustomed to its existence, 
the technology evolves into its own form. According to 
Nikolovska, electronics have contributed to clutter in the 
home. She predicted that in the future electronics will be 
better integrated to their environments, causing less clutter.
Though speaking to a different audience, Nikolovska's lecture 
echoed that of Spools. Whether on the Web or in the home, a 
product's design is a significant determinant of its success.

Gateway to the west: two centuries of blood, paint, stone, and steel
Pittsburgh art and architecture reflect the rich history of the city r by Shaleya Solomon | Layout Staff J
Black smoke curls out of chimneys and smokestacks. A 
constant cloud of dust and coal hovers over factories and 
tenement houses. War rages, fires blaze, men die, and wives 
cry.
This was the image of early 20th-century Pittsburgh. An 
old factory city and home of the original Carnegie Steel 
Co., Pittsburgh has endured wars, riots, poverty, and 
overcrowding. Pittsburgh's growth as a city really started 
with the War of 1812, when the British blockade increased 
inland trading and manufacturing of American goods. At 
that point, the city flourished because it was rich in coal 
and petrolium. It also earned the name Gateway to the 
West, due to an influx of immigrants headed for the western 
terrain. In 1845, a raging fire devastated the city, causing 
almost $9 million in damages. Rebuilding of the city was 
accompanied by new technologies, especially steel. The 
need for steel armaments during the Civil War boosted 
Pittsburghs, and the city became known as the "arsenal for 
the Union.
By the end of the war, one-third of American steel and twothirds of American glass were manufactured in Pittsburgh.
In the second half of the 19th century, labor rioting raged 
through the streets. In the late 1800s, Andrew Carnegie 
established the first Carnegie Library and Carnegie Institute, 
and in 1901 he sold Carnegie Steel to J.P. Morgan for 
$250 million  the rest is history. The end of World War
II saw reforms, both political and cultural, and although 
industrialism thrived, public building projects started to take 
form. This eventually resulted in the Pittsburgh we know 
today; the now up-and-coming city has made a complete 
"180 in terms of its aesthetics, culture, and everyday life, 
but has still managed to retain that old steel-town charm.
Architecture
The Allegheny County Courthouse, on Grant Street near 
Fifth Avenue downtown, is a stunning building with an 
interesting history. The current courthouse is actually the 
third in Pittsburgh history. The first one deteriorated due to 
coal smoke damage and the second was destroyed by fire. 
The entire building is built around an interior courtyard, 
which allows natural light and fresh air to circulate through 
most of the building. The main courthouse is connected 
to the former county jail, now a courthouse annex, by the 
Bridge of Sighs, similar to identically-named bridges in Italy, 
England, and Germany. The courthouse also showcases a 
five-story tower. Inside, the courthouse features gorgeous 
stone archways and columns. The heavy stonework and 
somewhat gothic feel show that this building, unlike its 
predecessors, is made to last.
Taking that heavy, gothic feel to a new extreme, the 
Cathedral of Learning is a symbol of life in the steel town. 
Sandwiched between Forbes and Fifth Avenues on Bigelow 
Boulevard, this 535-foot-high, 42-story Gothic tower is the 
symbol of the University of Pittsburgh and the Oakland 
community. The Cathedral of Learning is sort of an Empire 
State Building-meets-Notre Dame Cathedral structure.
The second-tallest educational building in the world, the 
Cathedral of Learning is a beacon of light (quite literally  it 
is lit up at night) and hope, and pays homage to Pittsburgh's 
variety of cultures. Within the Cathedral of Learning are
26 Nationality Rooms. Each room features decorative and
structural styles of a certain nationality, such as Armenian, 
Japanese, German, and more. The 10th chancellor of the 
University of Pittsburgh, John Gabbert Bowman, envisioned 
a home for learning that greatly represented the impressive 
city that Pittsburgh has now become.
Pittsburgh's most famous and well-known tourist attraction 
is not even really in Pittsburgh. Frank Lloyd Wrights 
Fallingwater is located about 90 minutes to the southeast; 
however, many people think of it as a part of the city, at 
least culturally In 1935, Wright designed it for the Kaufmann 
family (of Kaufmanns department store), completely going 
against the grain of the time by building the house over 
a waterfall. Like many of Wrights designs, Fallingwater 
attracts tourists from all over the world, as they flock to see 
what is now a museum.
One of Carnegie Mellon's faculty members, Arthur Lubetz, 
is the designer of one of the more modem architectural 
additions to Pittsburghs community. The LEED-certified 
Squirrel Hill branch of the Carnegie Library, on the corner 
of Forbes and Murray Avenues, may be a small hint of 
the direction in which Pittsburgh aesthetics is going. A 
large open space  vaguely reminiscent of a warehouse, 
complete with exposed ductwork, steel stairs, and glass 
walls  makes up the main area of the building and echoes 
Pittsburgh's industrial history. The library's claim to fame is 
most definitely its openness, greatly enhanced by glass and 
light. Large, comfortable chairs freckle the floors, many of 
them facing oversized windows.
Lubetz described his reasoning behind the unconventional 
setup. Libraries are in a state of change with the Internet, 
he said. "The question is, What is a library going to be in a 
few years? That building is very adaptable and flexible; the 
fines between the librarian space, the community space, and 
the book space are blurred." A favorite activity of visitors is - 
to sit in the windows facing the church. The windows are 
elevated off the floor and are large enough for one and often 
two people to be able to comfortably sit in and do work, read, 
or listen to music. The little window boxes on the Murray 
Avenue side all face different aspects of the church across 
the street; thats why they are at different angles," said 
Lubetz.
And what of the soot, smoke, and coal? Besides a new focus 
on LEED-certified buildings (a trend popularized here at 
Carnegie Mellon), Pittsburgh has embraced environmental 
activism in all aspects of the community. Garbage cans and 
recycling bins have appeared on street corners. Parts of 
Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, and downtown Pittsburgh feature 
artistic, Three Rivers-themed bicycle racks in an effort to 
promote environmental safety without marring the landscape 
and city design.
Art
The Port Authority of Allegheny County also moved to 
further incorporate art into everyday Pittsburgh life. The 
Pittsburgh Art in Transit campaign is an exchange between 
artists and the Port Authority, in which the city provides 
local artists with places for their artwork to be seen. In 
exchange, the artists provide work to be put on the buses
 hence the elaborately designed and more aesthetically 
pleasing 59Us, 61 Cs, and other buses driving around
Pittsburgh. Many of these buses also incorporate the culture 
of Pittsburgh with text in various languages adorning the 
sides and windows.
Buses arent the only places for artists to display their work 
in Pittsburgh, and for the artistically challenged, its also 
always fun to just see some artwork. For pieces dating as far 
back as 476 CE, visit the Carnegie Museum of Art. Located 
by the intersection of South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue, 
this space houses the works of esteemed artists, such as 
Degas, Van Gogh, and others, and includes art, architecture, 
sculpture, and more. A children's area allows kids to do arts 
and crafts to get hands-on experience. The fountains outside 
encourage visitors and create a surprisingly tranquil space to 
sit, relax, or do some homework, as well as add to the overall 
appeal of the Oakland community.
David Carrier, the Champney Family professor at Case 
Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Institute of 
Art, wrote about art in the community in his article "New 
York Art, Pittsburgh Art, Art: Art has the power to create 
a kind of community among a group of people who share an 
interest in looking at it. Similarly, Pittsburghs art brings its 
communities together. The ever-popular Gallery Crawl, for 
example, is a night when the galleries are open and free to 
the public. Visitors re encouraged go to as many galleries as 
possible to see a variety of art from visual to performance to 
film. It also gives people a chance to interact with others who 
share the same interests.
The Mattress Factory, so named for the original function of 
the space it currently inhabits, houses more artwork, some 
by local artists. Located in the Mexican War Streets area of 
the North Side, the Mattress Factory features contemporary 
pieces by artists from all around the world. These works 
are all created right in the area, and many of the artists live 
nearby. A frequent favorite is Yayoi Kusamas "Infinity Dots 
Mirrored Room, which features white mannequins with 
giant red polka dots situated in a mirrored room.
Despite having been an industrial center for most of the 19th 
and 20th centuries, the city has now evolved into an artistic 
and cultural haven; most of the steel left in this town is in the 
spirit of the community.
Top: Fallingwater, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, 
incorporates its surrounding landscape into its
architecture.
Center: The Carnegie Library in Squirrel Hill was built 
to accomodate technological and social aspects of the
future of Pittsburgh.
Bottom: The mural on Murray Avenue is one of several 
attempts to beautify the city and escape the "steel
town" feel.

From Forbes to Fifth: campus alternatives
Because of Craig Street, mixing it up doesnt have to be a hassle
For anyone who has ever complained about Carnegie Mellons 
lack of variety in dining or the overpriced art supplies sold in 
the UC, Craig Street can be a saving grace. With restaurants 
and shops ranging from an Asian eatery to an Indian clothing 
store, Craig Street, just a short walk from campus, can be a 
one-stop shop for almost every need.
Crpes Parisiennes, a quaint eatery that offers a large variety 
of crepes and other baked goods, is a great place to start a 
day. For breakfast and lunch, Craig Street offers a variety of 
scrumptious treats. Eat Unique (formerly Craig Street Coffee) 
is a cozy venue that serves deli sandwiches and boasts "the 
best soup in Pittsburgh."
"I got this African peanut soup and it was pretty good, 
different, kind of spicy, said first-year information systems 
major Meredith Huffsmith. Food prices are deliciously within 
budget for students as well; a cup of soup is only $2. Craig 
Street favorite Lulus Noodles has the international fixings of 
fresh Asian food  try Lulus teas with tapioca pearls for a 
sweet twist.
For dinner, Little Asia and Star of India offer more variety 
in international cuisine. Each has an assortment of flavorful 
entrees that are good for sharing. For something closer to 
home, theres Union Grill, which is almost always packed on 
the weekends with locals watching the game and munching 
down on all-American burgers. For carb-cravers, Quiznos and 
Villa Pizza are also open for both lunch and dinner.
Anyone who needs to find a gift can visit Watermelon Blues 
to stock up on a variety of trinkets, specialty cards, and
10 local......................I pillbox 10.30.06
prank gifts for that special someone. "We have lots of fun 
toys ... different kinds of pens and pencils and art supplies," 
said owner Betsey Schwartz, who recalled that, in the 28 
years her store has been open, Carnegie Mellon students 
have particularly enjoyed the Vincent Van Gogh and Carl 
Jung action figures as well as more functional items such as 
stationery, candles, and teas.
For a more homemade gift, the bead shop History, tucked 
away beside Middle Eastern eatery Ah Baba, lets customers 
design and create their own jewelry. [The beads] are really 
eclectic; we have everything from trade beads from Africa, 
masks from Himalayas, and we also carry a lot of vintage 
things, said store staff member Meg Weiss, who is also a 
student at University of Pittsburgh. Prices range from $2 to 
over $100, depending on design. "We have students who 
come in here and make a $2 or $3 pair of earrings, said 
Weiss, but then you can also make a very expensive necklace 
if you use some of the rarer beads. History is a great place 
for a private party as well; sororities from both Carnegie 
Mellon and Pitt go there to make jewelry to complement their 
formal dresses. Whether for a specific event or a just as a fun 
afternoon activity, History is a great place to let an artistic 
side shine.
A little farther up Craig Street sits the Sunshine Boutique, 
an Indian-inspired clothing store. Customers can channel 
their inner Nicole Richie by checking out beaded purses and 
funky jewelry, many of which come from India. The boutiques 
pieces, many of which are one-of-a-kind, can take some time 
to sort through. For European fashion, Craig Street is home 
to Irish Design Center, which can provide the tweed fix for
the season. Known for its cozy wool sweaters, the store keeps 
many warm and snuggly during Pittsburghs chilly winters. 
Although on the expensive side, all items are well-crafted.
After so many stores, shoppers may need a little down-time 
at Daniel and Co. A high-end salon, Daniel and Co. offers 
massages, manicures, pedicures, and haircuts (first trim is 
$10 off). Appointments are recommended.
Just across the street from Daniel's is Phantom of the Attic, 
the first and only stop for any board game imaginable. Owned 
by Jeff Yandora, a friendly game-lover, the store is the perfect 
place to stock up on indoor activities for a rainy day. Phantom 
of the Attics sister store, also located on Craig Street, features 
the best of old and new comic books. More erudite reading 
material is available at Caliban Book Shop, which has a huge 
collection of rare and used books. Although not exactly the 
place to find the newest edition of a biology textbook, it most 
definitely houses some interesting literature.
Craig Street, just a short walk from campus, has many of the 
things a student could want from a college town within the 
urban area of Oakland. Its cute shops and culturally diverse 
. eateries tailor to any college student, from the one who enjoys 
cuddling up to a great book and some tapioca tea to the one 
who spends all day playing with a Van Gogh action figure.

I hear the best way to get good grades is to go to class, do the 
homework, aid study. Unfortunately, sleeping in, playing WoW, and 
studying physics by playing beer pong dont exactly have the same 
effect.
With the holiday season coming up, now would be a good time to avoid 
getting deported.
Thanksgiving is just around the corner, so make sure to get your 
travel plans figured out soon. However, despite your best wishes and 
planning, youll end up taking work home with you anyway. Make sure 
not to spill gravy on your Tl-89.

If you havent already, go buy an umbrella, a pair of gloves, and a 
scarf. These wont be particular helpful seeing how youll lose alt of
with your grades compared to those good students.

Just as a heads-up, the weather is getting worse, and at some point 
soon youre going to slip on some ice. it wont necessarily hurt, but 
youll feel rather foolish. Even with knowing this will happen, you'll still be 
surprised to have it happen. Funny how that works, huh?

You decided to not go to any Halloween parties this weekend because 
you think there will be better ones next week. While this may or may 
not be the case, your costume will suddenly feel outdated. I suggest 
blaming calendars for being so ignorant and causing these kinds of 
issues.
