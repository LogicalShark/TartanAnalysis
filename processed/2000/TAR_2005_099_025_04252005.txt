Holocaust
Hacker attacks computers in Tepper School
by Alexandra Kilduff
News Editor
On April 10, officials at the 
Tepper School of Business dis
covered that a hacker had bro
ken into a number of computers 
in the school and possibly com
promised the personal informa
tion of up to 6000 people.
According to the April 21 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article 
CMU says hacker broke into
computers, information regard
ing graduate students, alumni, 
faculty, and staff was the most 
vulnerable. Although under
graduates were notified of the 
problem on April 20, they do 
not as of yet seem to have been 
direcdy affected.
Roger Ma, a fifth-year scholar 
and an undergraduate in the 
Tepper School, said that the 
administration sent something 
to the whole Tepper School of 
Business [saying that] that the
computers were compromised, 
but that they did not believe 
undergraduates information 
had been affected. Overall, 
Ma does not believe that the 
breach is a major concern for 
undergraduates.
Among information sent out 
to students was an e-mail from 
Milton L. Cofield, the executive 
director of the business admin
istration program, and a noti
fication from Joel Smith, Vice 
Provost of Computing Services.
Smiths e-mail states, Much 
of the information compromised 
in these incidents was not on 
servers but rather desktop or 
laptop computers. So, this is not 
a message exclusively to system 
administrators  it is a message 
to everyone who uses a com
puter at Carnegie Mellon. 
According to Teppers direc
tor of public relations, Michael 
Laffin, the incident was discov
ered some time around 10 pm 
on April 10, although it was difficult to pinpoint the exact time. 
As for how many computers are 
compromised, Laffin said, I 
know that at one point there was 
a preliminary number, but that 
he was not sure. He believed that 
compromised personal informa
tion included applicant data 
such as Social Security numbers, 
contact information, grade-point 
averages, and standardized test 
scores.

Imagine having an event equal 
to the magnitude of September
11 occur every day for five and a 
half years.
Rachel Goykhman, a first-year 
BHA major and social vice pres
ident of the Hillel Jewish Uni
versity Center, cites this example 
as the best way to comprehend 
how over six million Jews were 
exterminated in Nazi concentra
tion camps during the Holocaust. 
Last week, Goykhman and other 
members of Hillel commemorated 
Holocaust Remembrance Week, 
which coincided with the 60th 
anniversary of the Allied libera
tion of concentration camps.
According to current Pittsburgh 
resident and Holocaust survivor 
Fritz Ottenheimer, liberation 
wasnt as idealistic as many con
temporaries make it out to be.
When were talking liberation, 
were talking the liberation of an 
extremely small portion of peo
ple who were condemned to this 
type of life during the war, Ot
tenheimer said during a speech he 
gave last Tuesday. Ottenheimers 
speech was among the events that 
Hillel members planned to com
memorate the event.
A German-born Jew, Otten
heimer left Germany for America 
at the beginning of World War II. 
Ottenheimer later returned to his 
native country in the mid-1940s 
as a member of the U.S. Army.
During his tour of duty, Ot

by Marshall Roy
Staffwriter
On Wednesday, members of 
Carnegie Mellons community 
participated in the National Day 
of Silence in remembrance of 
those who have been silenced by 
hatred. Originally a day to honor 
victims of violence or discrimina
tion based on sexual orientation, 
the Day of Silence at CMU en
compasses all minority groups, 
including those defined by race, 
religion, and gender.
Signified by white ribbons and 
a day-long vow not to speak, the 
Day of Silence was composed of 
several events across campus. The 
Clothesline Project, which took 
place from 10 am to 5 pm in the 
Connan Room, was sponsored by 
Sexual Assault Advisors. T-shirts 
decorated in support of victims of 
sexual assault hung on a clothes
line which lined the perimeter of 
the room.
Then, at 5 pm, the days cer
emonial silence was broken by 
a town-hall-style forum on cam
pus diversity. The forum, which 
featured short, informal presen
tations from representatives of 
several important campus minor
ity groups, sought to address and 
discuss the most important issues 
facing minorities on both the lo
cal and national level.
Vijay Jesrani, a junior majoring 
in political science and profes
sional writing, is a co-president
of ALLIES, CMUs GLBT-straight 
alliance. According to Jesrani, 
The National Day of Silence... 
raises awareness about those who 
have been silenced by hatred. He 
added that some dont realize 
that hate crimes have occurred 
on our campus, including sexual 
assault, gay-bashings, discrimina
tion, and hateful language.
The meeting drew diverse par
ticipation from members of stu
dent government, SPIRIT, Hillel, 
ALLIES, and many more organi
zations. It was wonderful see
ing so many people at the Town 
Meeting, stated Jesrani. I feel 
that minority groups and campus 
leaders need to work with each 
other to end hatred. All of us are 
fighting similar battles and work
ing towards a common goal, and 
we need to join forces.
Catherine Scudera, a sopho
more majoring in psychology and 
creative writing and a member of 
ALLIES, said, I think the fact that 
we gave out T-shirts and also white 
ribbons that a lot of people wore 
really shows that the Carnegie 
Mellon community is growing in 
its awareness of hate crimes and 
specifically GLBT issues. I think 
the best part is seeing how many 
people from different organiza
tions buy shirts, take ribbons, and 
really participate.
As for future plans for group 
participation, Scudera added, 
I think theres always room for

For CMU alum, life after severing own arm remains challenging
by Yolanda Harvey
Special to The Tartan
Pinned between a rock and a 
hard place for six days, Carnegie 
Mellon grad Aron Ralston (EE 
97) did the unimaginable  sev
ered his own arm to save himself. 
But as incredible as his world-famous ordeal was, Ralston consid
ers the publicity tour for the book 
that recounts his story, not the 
ordeal itself, as his greatest test 
of endurance.
It [touring] was the most 
rigorous endurance event of my 
life. Id often only get three hours 
of sleep a night during those 
three months of solid touring. 
Forty-five cities over eight coun
tries in 90 days, 300 interviews, 
50 speeches, said Ralston in a 
recent phone interview.
In his book, Between a Rock and 
a Hard Place, Ralston recounts 
being trapped by an 800-pound 
boulder in a remote southeastern 
Utah canyon. He had taken an im
promptu trip to the high deserts 
of Utah to hike, bike, and connect
with the outdoors he loves, but 
failed to leave even a general itin
erary of his destination and ac
tivities with his roommates. This 
mistake, coupled with an affinity 
for risk-taking, impeded the res
cue effort that could have located 
him before he was forced to sever 
his own arm with the dull blades 
of a multi-use tool.
In late April 2002, Ralston was 
hiking through a narrow canyon 
when he encountered a 12-foot 
dropoff. Just a couple of feet 
down from the ledge was a boul
der the size of a bus tire, wedged 
between the walls of the canyon. 
Ralston tried descending via the 
boulder after his initial tests in
dicated it was stable, but while 
he was hanging over its side, the 
rock began to shift and fall. In 
order to keep from being fatally 
crushed, Ralston threw up his 
arms and tried to jump out of the 
way. While this saved his life, it 
was at the cost of his right arm, 
which ended up pinned between 
the boulder and the canyon wall.
Despite almost a week of ex
posure, shock, starvation, and
dehydration, Ralston survived. 
As a result of that day in 2002, 
he has broken into the spotlight, 
first as the story of his accident 
and extraordinary rescue became 
known, and then again after he 
published his book.
I recognized the power of 
the story almost right away, he 
says. All the letters and reac
tions people were having showed 
me that the miracle was not just 
for me and my family to enjoy. 
Where perhaps otherwise Ralston 
would have simply healed and re
turned to his risk-taking lifestyle, 
the responses he was getting from 
all over the world showed that he 
had a message people wanted to 
hear.
Life is ten percent what hap
pens, and 90 percent how you 
react. You have to transform ad
versity into possibility.
For Ralston, the ultimate ad
versity he faced was in making 
the decision to cut off his trapped 
right arm. Ralston couldnt bring 
himself to perform the grotesque

CMU alumnus Aron Ralston had to sever his own arm to survive a hiking accident. Now Ralston tours the world as a 
motivational speaker and has recently published a book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place. Above, the books cover photo.

Presidential perspectives: A look at this years accomplishments
Erik Michaels-Ober
I am writing this column for the last 
time, since my term as Student Body 
President ends at the end of this month. 
Student government has made some 
major improvements this year, and I will 
humbly highlight a few.
Leading up to the general election 
last November, student government 
launched a trial of the Collegiate 
Readership Program, which provided 
free copies of The New York Times, USA 
Today, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
so that students could be more informed 
about political issues. The recently 
approved referendum will make news
papers available during the entire aca
demic year, starting next semester.
Student government also formed a 
coalition of student organizations to 
coordinate voter registration and getout-the-vote activities in the Presidential
election. Coalition members organized 
some fantastic events, including the 
public showing of all three Presidential 
debates, a voter mobilization concert, 
and a student debate. Outside of all 
these events, student volunteers regis
tered students to vote. On Election Day, 
student government acquired the use of 
University shuttle buses to take students 
to and from polling places to make it 
as easy as possible for students to vote. 
Student voter turnout was reported to 
be the highest it has been since 1972.
Student government seized students 
political engagement and mobilized over 
one thousand students to write letters 
to Pennsylvania state politicians about 
proposed cutbacks to Port Authority bus 
services.
Following the visit of Malik Zulu 
Shabazz, student government sponsored 
two public forums to facilitate dialogue 
between students. I also held private 
meetings with campus leaders to discuss 
the issues raised by his speech.
Student government restructured its 
reserve accounts this year, freeing up 
funds for capital projects for Activities 
Board, cmuTV, and WRCT, so that these 
organizations will be able to better serve 
the campus community.
We funded the addition of reverbera
tion-dampening panels to Wiegand 
Gymnasium, so that concerts and events 
held there will sound dramatically bet
ter, and worked to install a card reader 
on the University Center door next to 
Entropy, so that students coming from 
the west side of campus have easier 
access to the building after midnight. 
We also encouraged the administration 
to install card readers on many of the 
vending machines across campus.
You may have noticed that the library 
is open 24 hours a day this week. This 
was another initiative of student govern
ment. We are also working to extend the 
operating hours of the University Center, 
particularly for athletics facilities, the 
dining locations, and Entropy. Over the
summer, there will be more improve
ments to dining with major renovations 
coming to the Highlander Cafeteria and 
Skibo Coffeehouse.
Last June, I visited Carnegie Mellons 
Qatar campus and attempted to lay the 
groundwork for student government 
there. I returned over Spring Break to 
find a flourishing campus with an active 
student government.
Student government also worked to 
incorporate the Graduation Pledge of 
Social and Environmental Responsibility 
into this years commencement exer
cises. Students who take this pledge 
make a commitment to consider the 
social and environmental consequences 
of their work after graduation.
I would like to thank everyone 
involved in student government who 
helped make this past year such a suc
cess. I would like to thank The Tartan 
for offering me this opportunity to write 
about student government, and I thank 
you for reading.
Executive
Privilege
Hidden in an inconspicuous file cabi
net on the third floor of Hunt Library, 
microfiche images of past issues of The 
Tartan compose the only consistent 
historical record of the student experi
ence at Carnegie Mellon University. In 
the 20s and 30s, The Tartan recorded 
the history of Carnival; in the early 
40s, The Tartan reflected students 
perception of World War II; and in the 
late 60s The Tartans opinion pages 
presented students demands for a 
more diverse community. For nearly 
100 years, The Tartan has worked 
tirelessly to serve the students of our 
University.
Halfway through a one-year term as 
the Executive Officer of The Tartan, I 
understand that building The Tartan 
into a strong, trusted, and entertaining 
student news source will be a chal
lenge. We have a number of significant 
barriers. We are working to overcome 
The Tartans recently rocky history  
in our own minds and in the public per
ception. We are pushing to restore the 
organizations financial health. And 
all the while we must wrangle with 
the fact that newspaper readership is 
declining nationwide.
The Tartan will confront these chal
lenges directly, energetically, and cre
atively. We are already taking the right 
steps.
This issue marks one academic year 
of consistent publishing. This may 
seem a small feat, to some, and it 
is an accomplishment our community 
should expect from us. But its impor
tance cannot be understated. In the 
past year, The Tartan has covered the 
Gates donation, the Shabazz affair, 
the RIAA lawsuits, and many other 
events and issues that are important to 
students and the University. We have 
emphasized fair and accurate cover
age, and Editor-in-Chief J.T. Trollman 
and I have received consistent feed
back confirming that our coverage is 
ever improving. This is a step in the 
right direction, and we must continue 
to develop our coverages scope and 
ensure its fairness and accuracy.
To rebuild the financial stability of 
The Tartan, we have reestablished a 
full business department. With less 
than a third of The Tartans budget pro
vided by the student activities fee, this 
newspaper cannot succeed without a 
business model. The new department, 
which includes an advertising staff 
and business staff, will develop The 
Tartans relationships with business
es in our community and continue to 
foster relationships with our national 
customers. A strong financial position 
will enable The Tartan to better train, 
equip, and pay its staff.
To contend with waning newspaper 
readership nationwide, The Tartan is 
working to make the newspaper more 
dynamic and usable both in print and 
online. To put the newspapers look and 
feel in the hands of creative designers, 
we have implemented a new, talented 
layout staff. Also, we have brought 
The Tartan back online  and while 
it is still developing, we are working 
to make our website into a usable and 
useful resource.
Sixty-three people worked on staff 
when we published this years first 
issue of The Tartan in August. The 
Tartans staff is now double that size, 
and the majority of our staff is young. 
We will return in the fall with a full 
staff, and we will be ready to wel
come even more passionate writers, 
designers, business representatives, 
photographers, and artists.
The Tartans strong reemergence 
this year gives me great hope. To The 
Tartans staff: You have devoted your
selves to informing Carnegie Mellon 
students of the important issues on and 
. off campus. Thank you for your dedica
tion. To everyone who gave encourage
ment and assistance to The Tartan: 
I thank you for your support. To the 
community at large, continue to hold 
your standards and expectations high: 
We will meet them.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 25, 2005
Alum cuts off arm to live, 
finds more stress in touring
RALSTON, from Al
and desperate surgery until the 
very end, when he was literally on 
the edge of death, and had even 
carved his own epitaph in the 
rock above his head.
In his book, Ralston writes of 
the event, Miserable, I watch an
other empty hour pass by.... I have 
nothing whatsoever to do. I have 
no life. Only in action does my life 
approximate anything more than 
existence. Without any other task 
or stimulus, Im no longer living, 
no longer surviving. Im just waitmg.
It was in waiting and raging 
against his situation that he re
alized how he could escape. I 
scream out in pure hate, shriek
ing as I batter my body to and fro 
against the canyon walls, losing 
every bit of composure that Ive 
struggled so intensely to main
tain, his book reads. Then I feel 
my arm bend unnaturally in the 
un-budging grip of the chockstone. And epiphany strikes me 
with the magnificent glory of a 
holy intervention and instantly 
brings my seizure to a halt: If I 
torque my arm far enough, I can 
break my forearm bones.
Just over an hour later, Ralston 
had successfully snapped both 
bones in his forearm, constructed 
a tourniquet to stop blood-loss, 
and cut through his skin, flesh, 
and nerves to free himself and 
give him a chance of rescue.
Months later, Ralstons book 
hit number nine on The New 
York Times list of bestselling 
non-fiction books, and he makes 
enough money to continue the 
free lifestyle he loves by doing 
speaking engagements all over the 
country. Its my business now, 
he says. I do a good deal of cor
porate and non-profit speaking. 
I tell young kids who are getting 
more freedom and responsibility 
that they have the power to create 
their reality, but also have the ac
countability for what they create.
Ralston spent a year writing the 
book, researching what happened 
from the perspective of his family, 
friends, and rescuers.
It was difficult; I had to pour 
myself into those six days I spent 
trapped, he says, speaking about 
the process of writing his story. 
Getting the details right was the 
most difficult  I had been awake 
for six days straight. Remembering 
exactly what happened at what 
point was a challenge mitigated 
slighdy by the video camera he used 
to record scattered moments of his 
ordeal.
Beyond that, he had to find out 
what he couldnt observe while 
trapped. I had to track down the 
rescuers and try to rebuild these 
branching shotgun events. It was 
a huge introspective detective 
journey. He also had to relive it 
with his parents. It wasnt so hard 
to talk to them about it, since we 
had gone over it so many times 
by then. But watching the video 
with my mother was the most 
difficult.
In the first of many video scenes 
Ralston recorded while trapped in 
the canyon, he attempts to ex
plain what it was he was seeking 
in this trip and his life. I dont 
know what it is about me thats 
brought me to this. But this is 
... what Ive been after. I go out 
looking for adventure and risk 
so I can feel alive. But I go out 
by myself and I dont tell some
one where Im going, thats just 
dumb. If someone knew, if Id 
have been with someone else, 
there would probably already 
be help on the way. Even if Id 
just talked to a ranger or left a 
note on my truck. Dumb, dumb, 
dumb.
While hard to relive, the effort 
was worth it, he says. Its very 
hard to move forward in your life 
when youre constandy having to 
relive the past. But while it was 
exhausting and tiring, it was also 
inspiring in many other ways. I 
got to see and hear other peoples 
inspirations. For every thousand 
people that hear what I have to say 
are a thousand different messages 
delivered. I have a plaque on my 
wall sent to me by a litde girl. Its 
made from plywood and painted 
silver, and says Yo [sic] got to 
keep on living. Other people have 
told me that the most courageous 
thing I did wasnt to cut off my 
arm, but to have the courage to 
quit my job at Intel and live the life 
I want, as a ski bum.
Even so, Ralston did his best 
not to let the fame go to his 
head. My friends became even 
more important to me during 
that time, he says. They were 
my balance. I took time to see 
them, which is part of why I 
slept so little. They kept me in 
check when Id slip into public
ity mode.
When asked what exacdy pub
licity mode entailed, he said, Id 
dominate the conversation, or 
start talking about how I was 
hanging out with a famous actress 
after the Letterman show. Theyd 
say, Yeah, yeah, shut up Aron, 
and wed go back to normal.
College buddy Chris Adukaitis 
(CE 97) observes that Ralston 
is still the active, spunky guy he 
was back in school. We called 
him Forrest Gump. He was a very 
smart guy, even by CMU stan
dards. But he ran everywhere. If 
you saw anyone running around 
on campus, you could safely as
sume it was Aron.
So has all the stress of fame and 
the crazy schedules been worth 
it? Ralston says yes. Talking to 
people and hearing their experi
ences really brightens my out
look, he adds. He continues to 
live a life that gives him satisfac
tion.
But despite the pressure, he 
continues to promote his message 
by speaking and touring. Fame, it 
seems, is the price Ralston pays 
for surviving and living how he 
wants. Its like that line from 
Road Runner by Jerry Garcia: 
love the life you live, live the life 
you love.
I wouldnt have said I could 
have [survived the accident] if 
you asked me before, but I did, 
he says. It came from inside. Its 
the spark of the divine in each 
of us.
Students honor victims of 
hate with Day of Silence
SILENCE, from A1
improvement, but were doing a 
good job so far.
Jacob Wilcock, a first-year 
majoring in information systems 
and Spanish, emphasized the 
need to effect change on a larger 
scale than solely campus-wide. 
Regardless of social conserva
tives stated intentions, wrote 
Wilcock in an e-mail, they have 
a history of destroying families, 
careers, and lives. I hold them 
personally accountable for the 
significant increases in violent 
anti-gay hate crimes that coin
cide with every major anti-gay 
political campaign.
The third phase of CMUs ob
servance of the National Day of
Silence took place in the evening 
at the Underground. A comedy 
hour, titled Stand Up, Stand 
Out, entertained with songs, a 
performance from the improvisational comedy troupe No Parking 
Players, and stand-up comedy.
In general, those involved felt 
that the Day of Silence achieved 
its goal of increasing awareness 
of the injustices of hate. [It] 
was incredibly successful this 
year. We had more participa
tion than ever, said Wilcock. 
Jesrani agrees, and is optimistic 
regarding minority relations at 
Carnegie Mellon. The National 
Day of Silence is incredibly im
portant on campus, said Jesrani. 
I think that having similar pro
grams in the future will lead to 
progress.
During the Clothesline Project on the National Day of Silence, students made 
T-shirts supporting victims of hate.
Holocaust survivors speak for remembrance week
HOLOCAUST, from A1
held roughly 300 foreigners 
that the Germans brought in to 
work. Ottenheimer notes that 
this situation was common to
ward the end of the war, as U.S. 
soldiers often found concentra
tion camps while looking for 
the enemy.
However, when Ottenheimers troop came across the 
camp, they found that the Ger
mans had already killed all of 
its prisoners.
Ottenheimer later showed a 
video of liberation and survi
vors that members of the Pitts
burgh Holocaust Society had 
created.
For Adina Klein, a junior 
architecture and chemistry 
major and the education 
vice-president of Hillel, the im
ages on the video were shock
ing. Piles of dead bodies were 
stacked on top of each other like 
animal carcasses, said Klein.
Ottenheimer spoke about the
piles of ashes he encountered at 
the camp, the incinerated bodies 
of former inmates. A pile of ashes 
is very impersonal. Its sort of like 
a statistic, he said. We hear 
the statistics of the Holocaust... 
and we tend not to think of the 
numbers in individual terms un
til we hear the fate of individual 
persons.
To help individualize the vic
tims, Hillel members read the 
names of Holocaust victims at 
the fence last Wednesday. The 
members chose to read the 
names of children, an undertak
ing that proved emotionally tax
ing, according to Goykhman.
For Goykhman and other 
members of Hillel, its important 
for people to realize the span of 
the Jewish population. When 
people think of a Jewish person, 
they think a white person. Its im
portant for people to understand 
that Judaism is something that 
reaches across all races and cul
tures. Its a religion, and every
one can be part of that religion,
Goykhman said.
According to Goykhman, the 
Holocaust is significant because 
it represents hate  not just 
hate for the Jewish community. 
Its an important message that 
people give about the Holocaust 
 never forget what people can 
do to each other through hate, 
she said.
This years Holocaust Remem
brance Week is significant for 
members of the CMU Jewish com
munity for another reason. The 
anniversary of the concentration 
camp liberation occurs during a 
year that many members of the 
CMU Jewish population feel has 
been  tumultuous, due to recent 
anti-Israel and anti-Jewish speak
ers on campus.
But according to Goykhman, 
cultural groups on campus are 
making progress. The events 
that weve had, the speakers that 
weve had, have brought to the 
surface what the students had 
been feeling  and the adminis
tration is really paying attention
to it, she said.
Following the Seeking Alli
ances through Leadership and 
Diversity (SALAD) workshop a 
few weeks ago, members of Hil
lel have organized activities with 
various other groups on campus, 
including co-sponsoring Ethio
pian Jewish musician Alula Tzadik with SPIRIT on March 23.
Its not that people were [re
luctant] about collaborating on 
events, but we never really knew 
how to, Goykhman said.
With the Holocaust Remem
brance events, members of 
Hillel hoped to bridge the gaps 
between groups while exposing 
them to Jewish history. There 
are people who have never heard 
of the Holocaust  and thats 
significant, Klein said.
Goykhman agrees. Everyone 
has had some experience with 
hate.
Editors Note: Adina Klein is 
a member of The Tartans copy 
staff.
Romanian Jew and Holocaust survivor Pearl Fichman spoke about her experiences during World War II at a Hillel-sponsored Holocaust Remembrance Week 
evet. The week coincided with the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.

Laffin also told the PostGazette that the reason for 
the ten-day delay between the

the school could directly con
tact students and alumni who 
might have been affected.
As of yet, there has been no 
reported evidence that any

misused. However, students in 
the Tepper School of Business 
are encouraged to keep an eye 
out to make sure that their 
information is not being com

tepper.cmu.edu/idalert, has 
been set up for students in
terested in learning more, and 
there is a hotline available at

Students who are concerned 
about the general security of 
their personal information 
can visit www.consumer.gov/

case of identity theft, such as 
unsolicited mail or calls from 
debtors or credit card com
panies with which students 
are not involved. Students 
should also check their credit 
card statements every three 
months initially, and if they 
are concerned they are victims 
of fraud, should close existing 
credit card or bank accounts.
This security breach is just

Junior Staffwriter
Chili Palmer, the protagonist 
of this springs Get Shorty se
quel Be Cool, said of his Honda 
Insight rental: Its the Cadillac 
of hybrids.
Character Martin Weir re
sponded, But what about 
speed?
If youre important, said 
Palmer, people will wait.
Last Thursday afternoon, 
a small crowd waited in the 
Merson courtyard for a silent 
invasion of cars. A joint effort 
by CMUs Sustainable Students 
and the Pittsburgh-based Group 
Against Smog and Pollution 
brought the owners of several 
different hybrid and biodiesel 
vehicles to campus.
The car show attracted quite a 
crowd, as potential owners tried 
out the controls of the ridicu
lously high-tech 2005 Toyota 
Prius or drooled over the new 
biodiesel VW Beetle with im
pressive gas mileage.
Jose Mieres, the Beetles 
owner, spoke about his trip to 
Niagara Falls and back without 
refueling: a total of 680 miles 
on one tank of gas. You get 
spoiled by the fuel efficiency of 
these cars. You will stop at ser
vice stations more to get snacks 
for yourself than to fill up your 
cars tank.
Later, the shows organizers 
moved things inside, as Isaac 
Porche of the RAND Corporation 
spoke about the future of cars in 
America. His computer was bro
ken, and his presentation miss
ing, but Porche still managed 
to give an engaging talk to, as 
he put it, one heck of a large 
audience.
Ever since the environmental 
movement of the 60s, people 
have been worried about the 
effects of their cars on the envi
ronment. Considering all steps 
in gasolines life, from produc
tion and refining to distribu
tion and final use, the fuel used 
by the average new vehicle re
sults in 10 tons of smog-forming 
emissions every year.
Industry has yielded two so
lutions to the gas-guzzling prob
lem: Hybrid cars like the Toyota
Prius rely on the combination of 
an electric motor and a gasoline 
engine, while alternative-fuel 
cars like the VW Beetle can use 
non-gasoline-based fuels such 
as biodiesel or ethanol.
Although sales of hybrid cars 
have been steadily increasing, 
Porche cautioned that things 
really arent as rosy as they 
seem. Every decade or so, a 
new wave of environmentally 
friendly cars appears, but they 
can never quite catch on.
Fuel efficiency and energy 
independence are not purely 
scientific issues; they are po
litical and economic issues, 
Mieres said. Engineers alone 
will not be able to do much.
The fact is, Americans like big, 
powerful cars. Porche said that 
GMC engineers once consid
ered putting a CD player in their 
new electric cars to replicate the 
sound of a big engine. He em
phasized that unless environ
mentally friendly cars become 
trendy (if expensive) status 
symbols  as cell phones did 10 
years ago  we will not see real 
reductions in nationwide emis
sions. Even super-low-emissions 
cars like the Honda Insight still
produce over three tons of gas
eous emissions per year. This is 
not your enviro-friendly fathers 
car, Porche said.
However, even if hybrid cars 
dont become the norm, theres 
no doubt that emissions stan
dards are improving. If youre 
thinking about killing yourself, 
dont get a new car, Porche 
jokingly advised. A much bigger 
problem is large diesel vehicles, 
such as school buses, he said: 
There are more emissions from 
the five-second acceleration of 
a bus than all day from a new 
car. The average school bus dis
charges over 1000 tons of pol
luting nitrous oxides emissions 
per year.
Improvements are small. Last 
year, the Allegheny County 
Council barred diesel power 
buses from idling for more than 
five minutes. A key theme in 
the literature from this years 
car show was that idling your 
engine for 30 seconds uses more 
gas than turning your engine off 
and back on.
Some have proposed that the 
government force car companies

Last year, one cluster printer 
user printed 15,960 pages in 
two months, according to data 
collected by Carnegie Mellon 
Computing Services as part of a 
rigorous analysis of the univer
sitys printing system. Thats 
about three 50-pound cases 
of paper, said Mike Kelleher, 
Clusters Field Consultant.
Cluster Services is aiming 
to solve such problems and is 
nearing the end of a two-year 
project of renovating the print
ing regime at CMU. The re
sult will be a new, kiosk-based 
printing system that will re
quire users to be present at the 
kiosk to release their jobs be
fore they are actually printed.
The goal of the project is 
to reduce the overall cost 
of printing, alleviate long
standing complaints from 
printer users, and rein in the 
abuse of cluster printers. The 
means to achieving those goals 
may also include a print quota, 
capping users total printing al
lowance.
Cluster Services recently de
ployed, for field testing, the 
first of three printing manage
ment solutions under consid
eration for wide-scale imple
mentation by the fall of 2005. 
The first kiosk is located in Kirr 
Commons. Cluster Services is 
seeking user feedback on the
system and is willing to make 
it worthwhile for respondents: 
Filling out a survey about the 
printing experience buys the 
survey-taker a chance to win 
an iPod Photo or a $300 gift 
certificate to the campus store.
Overall, a lot of the com
ments have been positive, 
said Pomona Valero, Clusters 
Manager. This is going to help 
with implementation. Were 
coming across the biggest 
problems now.
The most significant prob
lem so far has been recurring 
system freezes.
Under the new system, docu
ments will be stored on a server 
until the user releases the job 
by swiping his student ID and 
selecting the job on a touch
screen at the printer kiosk. By 
requiring the user to be pres
ent at the printer before the 
job will print, Cluster Services 
hopes to reduce waste and or
ganize the printing process.
Cluster managers estimated 
that as much as 50 percent of 
paper printed gets discarded, 
including cover sheets, which 
account for an estimated 12 
percent of all paper printed.
Diane Loviglio, founder 
of Sustainable Students, ap
plauds the goals of the print
ing project. This new printing 
system will not only save paper 
but will hopefully train stu
dents to be more responsible in

Bush listens to pirated 
music on iPod
Thousands upon thousands of 
people steal music in America, 
and one of them may be the 
President of the United States. 
By RIAA standards, some of the 
250 or so songs on President 
Bushs iPod are pirated. Bush has 
made it public knowledge that his 
personal aide, Blake Gottesman, 
is in charge of managing his iPod 
collection  but articles by both 
CNN and The New York Times 
report that staff media advisor 
Mark McKinnon has downloaded 
songs such as the Knacks My 
Sharona for the President, as 
well, and made ambiguous how he 
obtained the files. Blogs and the 
music activist group Downhill 
Battle have taken the pirate 
theory and run with it, and have 
even registered the domain name 
SueThePresident.com to give 
away to whomever they deem 
worthy.

National Geographic 
to track mans origins
Ever wonder if your ances
tors really came over on the 
Mayflower? Well, for $99.95 
and a swab of spit, you can now 
find out. Last week, the National 
Geographic Society began a fiveyear mission to boldly seek out 
the origins of mankind. Its plan 
is to collect the DNA of 100,000 
indigenous people throughout the 
world and look for similarities in 
genetic material to try to find pat
terns in human migration. Our 
DNA tells a fascinating story of 
the human journey, how we are 
all related and how our ancestors 
got to where we are today, said 
population geneticist Spencer 
Wells, who will head the proj
ect. Anyone can get involved in 
this project and learn their own 
genetic history. However, to avoid 
political problems, the society will 
not gather information on genetic 
diseases, and all of its anthropo
logical data will be made public.

NASA hit by bizarre 
$311 million lawsuit
NASA is being taken to court 
over its plans to try to crack open 
a comet to see whats inside. 
Last month, Russian astrologist 
Marina Bai filed a lawsuit with 
the Presnensky district court in 
Moscow, demanding that NASA 
abort its $311 million Deep Impact 
mission. Bai is also asking for 8.7 
billion rubles ($311 million) in 
compensation for moral damages. 
The actions of NASA infringe 
upon my system of spiritual and 
life values, Bai said. Bais case 
was initially dismissed, but the 
Moscow City Court took the 
appeal and will rule on her case 
after a hearing set for May 6.

Mystery of unpopped 
popcorn solved
At the bottom of every bag of 
popcorn there are always those 
stubborn kernels that refuse to 
pop. Popcorn lovers everywhere 
know how obnoxious, and often 
painful, it is when one of these 
rock-hard kernels manages to find 
its way into a handful of white, 
fluffy goodness. Researchers at 
Purdue University have solved the 
mystery of the unpopped kernel. 
It turns out that the structure 
of the kernels hull determines 
whether it will become a delec
table morsel or an inedible stone 
at the bottom of the bowl. If the 
hull is not sound, moisture will 
escape, and the kernel will not 
pop. To make the determination, 
researchers studied the crystalline 
structures of the hulls of popped 
and unpopped kernels.

How Things Work: Cloud Seeding
Jimi Okelana/Art Staff
William Nicoll
Here in Pittsburgh, were very 
familiar with clouds. During 
the winter months, Pittsburgh 
averages over 70 percent 
daily cloud cover. We arent 
strangers of rain, either: The 
Three Rivers have crested over 
30 feet more than 25 times 
since charting began in the 
1760s. With this abundance 
of rain, its hard to imagine 
not having enough. But what if 
you were a farmer, your liveli
hood dependent on the rainfall 
of your region? What if you 
were plagued by droughts? 
Once upon a time, you might 
have been tempted to per
form a rain dance. Today, we 
need no rain dance: We can 
make our own rain. Are the 
X-Men real? Does Storm rent 
out her rain-making services to 
the highest bidder? No, weve 
got technology. Heres how 
things work:
This technology, known as 
cloud seeding, has been around 
since 1946. It was then that 
Vincent Schaefer of General 
Electric Labs performed the 
first experiments in man-made 
weather atop Mt. Washington 
in New Hampshire. Schaefer 
observed cloud formation atop 
the mountain and tried many 
times to reproduce the effect 
within a freezer box in his labo
ratory. Previous theorists had 
proposed that precipitation 
occurred when super-cooled 
water high in the clouds accu
mulated around tiny particles 
of dust. While this is true, 
Schaefer was unable to repro
duce the effect in his labora
tory, even after the addition 
of all sorts of chemicals. One 
day, however, he tried adding a
sample of dry ice. This resulted 
in the instant formation of a 
miniature snow storm in the 
freezer box! It was discovered 
that the very low temperature 
of the dry ice caused ambient 
moisture in the air to instantly 
crystallize. What potential did 
this hold?
The basic theory of cloud 
seeding revolves around 
increasing the number of ice 
nuclei in the upper levels of 
clouds. When a sufficient num
ber of these nuclei are present 
in a cloud, they become ice 
crystals, which then, grow larg
er and fall. The ice crystals melt 
into rain as they reach warm
er air at lower altitudes. The
majority of clouds dont con
tain enough of these ice nuclei 
to form precipitation. By artifi
cially increasing their numbers 
 seeding them  rain can 
sometimes be induced.
Today, several methods exist 
to artificially produce precipi
tation from existing clouds. As 
with Schaefers early experi
ments, dry ice can be seeded 
into clouds. This is often done 
from airplanes, so the upper 
levels of the clouds are cooled 
to near minus 40 degrees 
Fahrenheit  the temperature 
at which ice nuclei form spon
taneously.
Cloud seeding can also be 
completed with hygroscopic
chemicals  a fancy term for 
substances that attract water. 
The most common hygroscopic 
materials used are salts: potas
sium chloride and sodium 
chloride, common table salt. 
Dispersed into a cloud from 
air or ground, these salts will 
attract water vapor to their 
surfaces, forming the base for 
ice crystal formation. Finally, a 
chemical known as silver iodide 
mimics the molecular structure 
of ice, tricking water molecules 
in the cloud to grow on it as 
if it were an ice nucleus itself. 
Silver iodide has been shown 
to be the most effective cloud 
seeding chemical.
While the potential for cloud
seeding may seem boundless, 
there are many limitations. 
Unfortunately, only specific 
types of clouds are seedable. 
Cloud seeding is often limited 
to puffy cumulus clouds or lay
ered stratus clouds. On top of 
this, very specific conditions 
must exist within these clouds 
for seeding to actually produce 
precipitation: Specific tem
perature, low wind speeds, tall 
enough clouds, and the pres
ence of enough water vapor 
are all necessary for seeding 
to be successful. This complex 
set of ever-changing variables 
has long frustrated scientists 
trying to make cloud seeding 
economically viable. These fac
tors are so variable, in fact, 
that the effectiveness of cloud 
seeding is hard to determine 
because experiments can not 
be repeated!
Nevertheless, large-scale 
experiments in cloud seeding 
have been attempted all around 
the world. The U.S. ran an 
interesting project from 1962 
until 1982 known as Project 
Stormfury. For the project, 
planes would seed the outer 
walls of hurricanes in the hopes 
of weakening the interior of the 
storm. Although the seeding 
of four hurricanes produced 
observable results, they were 
later discounted when knowl
edge of hurricane phenomena 
increased.
Harnessing a system as com
plex as our atmosphere will 
always be difficult. The limi
tations of cloud seeding are 
reflective of this complexity. 
But with further development 
of cloud seeding, we may one 
day be able to control rain for 
the benefit of people around 
the world.

Campus ogles enviro-friendly cars
Cluster Services deploys trial printers
Prospective student Mike Laurence and his father Bob Laurence scrutinize the interior of the Lexus RX400h at the enviro-friendly car show organized by Sustainable Students last Thursday in the UC Merson Courtyard. Local hybrid and 
biodiesel car owners put their cars on display to promote alternative power automobiles.

disagrees. I think its unfair for 
the green side to say, You can do 
this no problem.  Unfortunately, 
government mandates scare 
companies into avoiding the 
generally unprofitable hybrid 
market altogether. Porche said 
that he could not believe that 
Toyota was making money 
with the Prius. He explained 
that government mandates can 
actually increase pollution, be
cause hybrids are more expen
sive, so people who would nor
mally buy a new car to replace 
their clunker wont because they 
cant afford it.
Many are hoping that all our 
environmental problems will be 
solved when the last oil wells 
run dry. Mike Griffin, Executive 
Director of CMUs Green Design 
Institute and a former oil 
industry consultant, discounted 
the idea, arguing that every year 
the oil industry has found more 
oil than had been consumed the 
previous year.
Mieres agreed: The Stone Age 
didnt end [because] we ran out 
of stones. He explained that our
best hope for transition to a new 
era of zero-pollution vehicles is 
to make environmentalism lucra
tive to the car companies.
Simply put, the green car ini
tiative is facing a double chal
lenge. It must do more than in
vent cars that are environmen
tally friendly; they must also be 
economically profitable. The 
hybrid car very well could be 
the answer. Its super-low emis

mileage and smooth perfor
mance. All thats missing is a 
speaker system making loud

Pangs for the memories: 
One student reminisces
Alexander Meseguer
They say the years spent at college 
are some of the best in life. For me, true 
happiness cannot be measured with 
grade point averages, exam scores, or 
starting salaries. True success is bet
ter measured by the quality of your 
friends, the lessons you learned, and 
the number of laugh wrinkles you see 
in the mirror. If the crows feet around 
my eyes are any indication, then, this 
has been a damn good four years.
When it comes to the lessons learned, 
I count myself as one of the lucky ones. 
Charmed, you might say.
But it wasnt fun to be at the center of 
a scandal, especially one I let happen. 
Those torturous two weeks last spring 
left indelible marks which will stay im
printed on my character forever.
The Natrat taught me more about 
how people think and feel than any 
class or sensitivity training could have. 
Was it wrong to publish it? Yes. Was it 
misinterpreted? Yes. Do I think anyone 
at The Tartan was or is a racist? Abso
lutely not.
While I apologized to those tortured 
and torn by what laid on those pages,
I found something of my own to say 
to those who called for my resigna
tion and expulsion. I said the cartoon 
should not offend you because youre 
black or Hispanic and I should not be 
ashamed of myself because Im a His
panic and should know better. The 
disregard for human life expressed in 
that comic were offensive on a far more 
fundamental level than race. I dont 
see how it makes sense for someone to 
be more or less offended because they 
are of a certain race; our membership 
of humanity should offer all of us the 
appropriate level of offense. Those at 
the Fence who chided me should have 
paused and thought before applying a 
preconception of a shared experience 
to someone merely because of their 
race. The willful failure to do so is a 
form of ignorance.
On my part, failing to continue a per
sonal exploration of the issue of race 
and class would be a form of ignorance 
too. Its hard to put words to the lessons 
of the Natrat, but one is very clear to 
me: Im less afraid to confront the issue 
of race. Whether it be in my day-to-day 
conversations or in what I offer to the 
public through my journalism, I am 
better for having made that mistake.
See REFLECTIONS, page A9
At the close of every year, the Tartan 
reassesses the years events. We present 
here a list of the people and happenings 
that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go 
to people and events that had a positive 
effect on the campus community; thorns 
go to those that have negatively impacted 
the campus.
A thistle to Finn Kydland and 
Edward Prescott for winning a 
Nobel Prize in Economics. Yinz guys are 
pretty smart, nat. Congratulations.
A thorn to the University for once 
My again raising the cost of attending 
CMU. From the technology fee to the 
laundry fee, students cant move without 
being charged for something. Maybe if 
the University had an larger endow
ment, we wouldnt be facing these kinds 
of problems.
A thorn to Kierra Wright, organizer 
Mr of the Malik Zulu Shabazz lecture. 
Wright, when denied funds by Student 
Senate, inappropriately represented 
Shabazz to the campus community, in
cluding SPIRIT, not taking into account 
the risks of such an inflammatory speak
ers potential. The event was an unnec
essary affront on campus and caused 
more harm than good.
-0S& A thistle to Student Senate for keeping student dollars from finding 
their way into the pockets of an antiSemitic, homophobic, and racist hatemonger. Too bad this was up for debate 
to begin with.
A thistle to Nick Scocozzo. For the 
last year, he has been one of the 
students crucial to keeping student gov
ernment grounded. His dedication and 
objectivity will serve the students well 
when he becomes Student Body VicePresident for Finance.
A thorn to Student Senate for everyMr thing else. They throw good money 
after bad, funding nearly any organiza
tion that comes to them. Senators just 
show up and vote like sheep; it seems 
like they never do any research into 
what theyre funding.
^7 A thorn to absentee Student Body 
President Erik Michaels-Ober for 
actively making himself invisible to the 
community. We elected you to focus 
on issues relevant and immediate to 
the student body rather than on pet 
projects.
A thorn to the Elections Committee 
-My for failing to do its job. With 
campaigns threatening lawsuits and 
others claiming slander, where was the
Elections Committee and chair to step 
in and regulate? Where were they when 
there was inaccurate information on the 
ballots? Where were they when there 
were errors in the electoral process?
pfc A thistle to the student body for 
being motivated and voting in the 
national Presidential election. It proved 
to the country were not completely apa
thetic. If only Carnegie had set up shop 
in Ohio...
A thistle to the newly founded 
Athletics Council, who put together 
a number of great events to raise school 
spirit, something that was long overdue. 
Go Tartans!
A thorn to the Student Dormitory 
My Council for walking and talking like 
a student government organization  
but throwing dorm parties, and running 
a buggy out of their (our) budget. The 
students would be better served if SDC 
resolved its identity crisis.
#
A thistle to cmuTV for their trans
formation into the television sta
tion this campus needs rather than the 
one they were barely willing to fund. 
Their Buggy coverage was stellar, as 
always, and their original programming 
continues to represent money better 
spent than it would be by almost any 
other organization.
A thorn to the Division of Student 
M- Affairs for doing nothing to correct 
a flawed judicial process. The University 
Committee on Discipline (UDC) system 
grossly violates the rights of those in
volved, giving the administration carte 
blanche to punish students, all in the 
name of privacy.
A thistle to readme for recovering 
from more than a semester un
der Brian Leahy, its editor, who found 
racism, bigotry, and petty stereotypes 
funny. Finally its becoming humorous 
again, not just myopic and angry. Keep 
the jokes coming, guys.
j^|| A thorn to Mel Bochner for deMr signing and building yet another 
architectural travesty on our campus: 
the Kraus Campo. A student sculpture 
garden, a small, tasteful park, or even 
a putting green would have been more 
pleasant than this debacle.
A thorn to the antiquated CMU 
My website for not keeping up with 
the expectations of the top computer 
science school in the country. The site is 
difficult to navigate and visually unap
pealing; it reflects W eb design from five 
years ago.
Danielle Saudino/Art Editor
A thorn to iiber-shy University 
Mr President Jared Cohon. While 
historically hes been more accessible, 
this past year he always seemed to be out 
of town trying to rake in more money 
for the endowment while neglecting his 
duties as chief shepherd of the Carnegie 
Mellon flock.
A thistle to soon-to-be-former Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy. 
For years he has been students closest 
link to Warner Hall. We hope he stays 
close to the students as he reaches ever 
greater heights in the Universitys ad
ministrative ladder.
A thorn to the fraternities who 
My make a bad name for the rest of the 
quad. This year alone, one house lost its 
charter and another looks to be kicked 
off the quad for at least a year. Even if 
a house is getting evicted, its never ap
propriate to post pornography on your 
website and sledgehammer the walls on 
your way out.
1^7 A thorn to Housing Services for not 
My opening up the Greek vacancies 
to independent organizations. If Sigma 
Tau Gamma can be located in special 
interest housing, why cant special inter
est groups at least place a bid for these 
locations?
A thistle to Summit, Roger Mas 
fifth-year scholar project that was 
well executed. The entire Summit staff 
pulled it off nicely and we hope these 
mini-enrichment courses become a reg
ular institution at CMU.
A thistle to StuCos recognizing that 
it would better serve the students 
by becoming more democratic. We cant 
push aside this rare opportunity for stu
dents to teach classes.
d&r A thistle to The Thistle, our yearbook, which would have gone 
under without the persistent efforts of 
senior Joshua Chaise, its Editor-in-Chief. 
His optimism and dogged work-ethic 
made the yearbooks recovery possible; 
we hope this momentum is sustained.
A thistle to UC administrator Stan 
Krowitz for being an uplifting, 
thoughtful, and compassionate keeper of 
the only space on campus that students 
can call their own. His school spirit is 
something we should all aspire to have.
#
A thistle to Central Property 
Services for cleaning up after The 
Tartan and the rest of the school. These 
people are among the many who work 
thanklessly to make this school run 
smoothly.
nay-sayer into staffwriter
because it is not often that an AsianAmerican writes opinion pieces in The 
Tartan. I should bring my ethnicity out 
in the open, rather than try to hide it.
It was on that day I realized he was 
right. My opinions and feelings about 
issues always seemed insignificant. 
This was because the people who I 
shared my ideas with were just like me. 
This was my one chance to share my 
opinions with people who never un
derstood what it is like to be an AsianAmerican. Instead of being beaten to 
death and cliched, my stances on issues 
were suddenly novel.
With graduation just around the cor
ner, my time here at The Tartan is com
ing to an end. It saddens me, because 
this has been a very new and enlighten
ing experience. The Tartan is not filled 
with anti-Asian writers and editors, as 
I had previously thought. The editorial 
staff that I have worked with have been 
nothing but completely supportive of 
any opinions that I have. Even when I 
used some very divisive language in my 
articles, my editors always went out of 
their way to make sure that I did not 
feel as if my ideas were being censored. 
Perhaps it is because I became a staff
writer after the Natrat incident, but 
to me, The Tartan goes out of its way to 
promote diversity of thought and opin
ions without crossing the line.
Im not trying to say that The Tartan 
is perfect. One thing that I would re
ally like to see in the future, is more 
Asian-Americans taking up writing po
sitions. We make up nearly a quarter 
of the undergraduate population, yet 
we are largely underrepresented on 
the writing staff. Its no wonder that 
so many people have misconceptions 
of how we are. A friend of mine men
tioned to me that some members of The 
Tartan think most Asians on this cam
pus are really airheaded and stupid. 
It is up to us to debunk this myth. One 
step in the right direction would be to 
join The Tartan.
Alexander Su (asu@) is a senior decision 
science major. He thanks Sean Mintus 
for attacking Asian Greek organizations. 
Without his efforts, this author may have 
never joined the Tartan. He hopes that 
next year, there will be more Asian-Americans that become staffwriters.
Alexander Su
Three years ago, as I sat in the UC 
black chairs, I could not believe what I 
was reading in The Tartan. I had been 
aware of the cynicism that the school 
newspaper had always expressed to
ward Asian student organizations, but 
this one was particularly hurtful. Al
though the editorial may have been 
written solely to deliberately elicit a re
sponse from the community, it was still 
published. Sean Mintus, a senior staff
writer, pointed out that Asian Greeks 
were groups that promoted exclusive
ness and ran counter to the ideals of 
cultural diversity. While I truly believed 
that Mr. Mintus was sorely mistaken, I 
was helpless in responding because I fit 
the exact profile of the exclusive Asian 
he was describing. I had only Asian 
friends, and my life revolved around 
only Asian organizations. On that day, I 
made a promise to myself that I would 
one day write for The Tartan and break 
the stereotype of the typical AsianAmerican.
The debate about whether Asian 
American Greek organizations are 
helpful or hurtful to diversity remains 
inconclusive and is not the question 
here. The purpose of this editorial is 
not to persuade you to see things my 
way. In fact, when I joined The Tartan 
this past fall, I didnt want to write 
about Asian American issues. I wanted 
to be just like other staffwriters. I 
wanted to write about political issues. 
I wanted to write about worldy issues. 
I wanted my readers to be unable to 
identify my race solely on the basis of 
my writing. I wanted to be the perfect 
assimilated writer. This notion did not 
last very long.
Earlier this semester, I wrote a piece 
about my position on affirmative action. 
When I showed a first draft to a friend, 
he said that, though I made a few good 
points, it did not sound different from 
arguments made by other people. Per
haps I should give my own personal 
perspective on the topic, rather than 
make objective assertions anyone could 
read from other sources. He felt that 
my perspective would be quite unique,

THE TARTAN  APRIL 25, 2005 A9
Remedying anti-intellectualism within the g(r)eek culture
obvious to say, but all Greeks on 
campus are members of Greek 
organizations. They all chose to 
join and they are leave at any 
time. Thats why the entire notion 
of anti-Greek bias is ridiculous. 
Youre allowed to judge people 
based on their choices, and 
everyone who is Greek chose to 
be so and chooses to stay. Com
plaining about anti-Greek bias is 
like complaining about anti-bigot 
bias.
Whereas geek life is pre
dominantly composed of m 
ildly marginalized individuals 
in decentralized, organic social 
networks, Greek life is the sta
tus quo consciously organized. 
Both continue to exist in spite of 
their backward ways because of 
a serious problem of alienation 
on this campus. Look at what 
a fraternity offers a first-year: a 
group of friends, a place to live, 
a series of parties to go, members 
of the opposite sex to socialize 
with, a structure for advance
ment, and tradition. People who 
go Greek are usually well-mean
ing people who think its a great 
way to make a difference in the 
community. They just happen to 
be wrong.
Alienation also strengthens 
geek life. While I took some cheap 
shots at KGB before, I consider it 
one of the few organizations that 
try to get geeks out of their rooms. 
There are hundreds, if not thou
sands, of undergrads who spend 
the majority of their college lives 
in their rooms in front of their 
computers. These students often
strate the strength of our student 
body. There will still be g(r)eeks, 
but they will never be able to 
threaten a strong public sphere 
that values intellectualism, diver
sity, and challenging students.
The specter of anti-intellectual
ism continues to haunt Carnegie 
Mellon, and it emanates from 
a very small group of students. 
It is time to build communities 
that no longer tolerate this sim
plistic worldview. It is time for 
Carnegie Mellon to have com
munities where students treat 
each other as equals and dont 
refer to each other as homos. 
Where if students pass out, they 
get adequate medical attention 
and dont get vulgarities drawn 
on them. Where intellectual curi
osity is valued, not seen as lame 
or totally gay.
The school has a mindset of 
a battered spouse. Every time a 
Greek organization screws up, 
the school puts a new one in its 
place, hoping maybe if they try 
harder, it wont happen again. Its 
time to move on and use those 
spaces for more living areas like 
Forbes House. Carnegie Mellon 
has nothing to lose but its biggest 
weakness.
In all fairness, Mark Egerman 
(mde@) didnt do much gracefully 
in his five years here. If students 
are interested in learning more 
on these subjects, he recommends 
reading Richard Hofstadters 
Anti-Intellectualism in American 
Life and Peggy Reeves Sandays 
Fraternity Gang Rape.
The joys of an education 
beyond classes and books
REFLECTIONS, fromA8
I dont care if people remember 
me for the Natrat, but I do want 
them to have a clear idea of what 
Im trying to do now: learning to 
tell the truth.
Some think the truth, whether 
its public or personal, is some
thing ugly and unattainable, pie 
in the sky and not worth the 
trouble of figuring out. One les
son Ive learned is that it tends to 
hide in the shadowed corners of 
the world. If youre smart, youll 
be able to lure it into the light 
with choice words and a dogged 
curiosity. But sometimes you find 
yourself venturing into the dark
ness to get it, tainted in the pro
cess. I may have emerged from 
the trip a little tainted, but better 
for the experience.
To me, having that bit of truth, 
whether it is public or personal, 
is worth the search. In the pages 
of the school newspaper, I found 
the courage to choose to look 
for it as a journalist. I dont have 
enough space left to do my feel
ings justice in print.
When I came here as a firstyear, wide-eyed and bushy-tailed,
I had no idea that the lecture hall 
and computer cluster would be 
the last places I would find my 
education.
Three hundred and sixty-five 
units later, Ill be graduating with 
a degree in electrical and com
puter engineering, but I will al
ways consider my real education 
to have been gained on the third 
floor of the University Center, 
home to the student organizations 
and some of my best friends.
My curriculum looked some
thing like this:
UC-106 Drama for Non-Majors 
with Andrew Moore. Andrew, 
you were a welcome surprise 
as a friend, and a good man. 
Our far-flung conversations have 
changed the way I thought about 
drama majors and expanded my 
view of the world. Thank you.
UC-418 Contemporary Activ
ism with Dan Papasian and Matt 
Toups, two of my favorite antiestablishment rabble-rousers. 
You showed me theres nothing 
wrong with thinking outside the 
ideological box.
UC-314 Collegiate Journalism 
with The Tartans editorial staff. 
It was never boring. Thanks for 
making the paper possible. I wish 
everyone the best.
UC-576 Technology & Culture 
with Mark Egerman. The right 
man at the right time for The 
Tartan, Mark made the power 
of combining cultural awareness 
and technology clear to me like 
no one else has. You have a gift 
for making the profound simple 
and easy to understand.
UC-243 Organizational Politics 
with Michelle Birchak, Nicholas 
Scocozzo, and Steve Kling. My 
pipelines to student government 
and so much more, they have 
given me a crisp understanding 
of what its like behind the scenes 
of student government.
Im off to make my mark on the 
world. Wish me luck.

I have no intention of leav
ing gracefully. Five years ago, I 
started my career as an activist by 
fighting against anti-intellectual
ism. I remain convinced that this 
must be a primary goal of student 
action on this campus.
Last week, I laid down what 
I saw to be the five underlying 
tenets of anti-intellectualism 
among students here at CMU. I 
made the claim that these were 
the principles that guided both 
geek culture and Greek life. This 
week, its time to talk about how 
to fight the prevalence of these 
ideals.
Id like to clarify something be
fore we get any further: There 
is no moral equivalence be
tween geek life and Greek life. 
They are based on the same 
anti-intellectual tenets but ex
press them in very different ways. 
While geeks might use technical 
terms to describe interpersonal 
relations, frat boys will use terms 
of dominance such as fag, bitch, 
slut, or homo. Say what you will 
about them, I find geeks signifi
cantly more caring than Greeks, 
who do some remarkably uncar
ing things to people they call 
brother.
Unfortunately, its almost 
impossible combat geek life 
because it is essentially decen
tralized. Greek life is the exact 
opposite. It almost seems too
just dont see any reason to get 
involved and there does not exist 
enough of an infrastructure to 
encourage them.
Theres a solution to both. Ev
erything would change if hous
ing were to transition from the 
current first-year mega-dorm 
paradigm of New House, Donner, and Morewood toward 20- to 
40-person houses with communal kitchens and lounges. Placing 
first-years in these giant build
ings instead of small houses leads 
them to find people like them
selves. Small circles of friends are 
created (too often along ethnic 
lines) and first-years tend not to 
focus on their own community. 
Forbes House is the only place 
that gets it right.
You can change people by
changing how they live. Give 
these small houses a budget for 
events and food, transform the 
role of the RA from leader to 
facilitator, give students a direct 
role in the management of their 
own building, and this campus 
will prosper. If these houses are 
randomly assigned, we will see 
diverse organic communities 
created that will truly demonAcademia threatened
CMU Faculty
University communities 
across the United States are fac
ing a campaign of intimidation 
directly threatening academic 
freedom. Professors at Colum
bia University facing charges of 
institutionalized anti-Semitism 
have been subjected to death 
threats, hate messages, and 
massive sabotage of their email correspondence. Yet these 
charges were found to have 
been grounded on no evidence 
by an ad hoc faculty commit
tee on March 31. A victim of 
these tactics at Columbia, Prof. 
Joseph Massad, lamented, The 
Columbia University adminis
tration acted as a collaborator 
with the witch-hunters instead 
of defending me and offering 
itself as a refuge from rightwing 
McCarthyism.
Most recently two speakers 
invited by Carnegie Mellon 
University, Ali Abunimeh and 
Norman Finkelstein, were the 
subjects of organized harass
ment. During Mr. Abunimehs 
February 3 talk, hecklers who 
rehearsed their tactics before
hand, in which they referred 
to the speaker as a cockroach 
and waved signs, laughed and 
applauded when the speaker 
described Palestinian suffering, 
and had to be warned the meet
ing would be canceled if they 
continued.
Norman Finkelsteins March 
14 lecture had been delayed 
for a month after pressure was 
placed on CMU administrators 
from outside the University
community. A few days before 
his appearance, Laura Conrad, 
Program Associate for the Hillel Jewish University Center of 
Pittsburgh, distributed an e-mail 
to CMU students and members 
of the Center which explicitly 
laid out a program designed to 
prevent Finkelstein from being 
heard by the community at large:

who cannot be influenced by 
Finkelsteins rhetoric. Through 
filling the hall with Jewish stu
dents and community we will

propaganda. At Finkelsteins 
lecture, audience members 
stood and turned their backs 
on the speaker, spoke loudly to

Kosher dining welcomed
Elizabeth Buckser
Throughout my time here at 
CMU, the chief complaint has 
always been dining. Usually 
this complaint is fairly accu
rate, if not wholly justified. I 
took this complaint to heart and 
have been an adamant part of 
dinings improvement over the 
last three years. Five weeks ago 
Parkhurst and Tim Michael, in 
association with Hillel, started 
to provide something wonder
ful. This year students on cam
pus who eat kosher are being 
provided for.
Every other day, food is deliv
ered to the University Centers 
Grab-N-Go. The Kosher Korner 
provides gourmet dishes, from 
entrees to sides, available at 
cheap prices. Offering a very 
large amount of food, each 
entree can almost be looked at 
as two nights worth of food. Its 
fresh, its cheap, and it provides 
a needed addition to dining. 
This year the coming of Passover 
wont mean gross frozen food, 
but chicken, salad, and a drink 
to wash it down with.
The salad bar in the UC, an 
entire refrigeration case, and 
two dry food shelving units offer 
kosher food to the University. 
Many students didnt even 
notice the change, except for 
a few new signs. This is the 
only point of contention; once 
again Dining Services started 
something new without much 
marketing or advertisement to 
support it. For those students 
who did notice the change, it 
signaled a new start in their
dining lives.
This past week Dining Services 
held a student session to deter
mine the success of the Kosher 
Korner program. Providing 
food for all while discussing the 
program, the students provid
ed feedback on how to make 
the program better and how it 
functions right now. While still 
not being used to the level Tim 
Michael might want, the stu
dents reassured him about the 
Passover jump and how the pro
gram filled a need on campus.
The term kosher means that 
the food has been blessed by 
a rabbi, and follows the laws 
of kosher. For Passover this 
extends to a ban against bread, 
beans, and foods with leaven
ing, including soda from the 
fountain. Dining services has 
pledged to support the students 
who will no longer be able 
to prepare food in their own 
kitchens.
Not only has Dining Services 
started to provide food Jewish 
students can eat, they have also 
recognized that some students 
cannot pay for food on the 
Shabbat. They have agreed, as 
they do for Ramadan, to take 
student ID numbers and remove 
blocks from the appropriate 
period. This means that not only 
can students eat, but they can 
also use their meal blocks and 
not get screwed out of wasting 
their meal plan.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 25, 2005
Carnegie Mellons student 
newspaper since 1906
THE TARTAN
would like to thank
CENSORSHIP, from A8
called at various intervals. Finkelsteins discourteous treatment 
was capped by the imposition, 
without consultation, of a rebut
tal scholar, who attempted to 
discredit Finkelstein by alleging 
his popularity with anti-Semitic 
hate groups, not by engaging di
rectly with his argument.
A profound 
cultural amne
sia, regrettably, 
seems to afflict 
many sectors 
of our modern 
society.
A notable proponent of open 
discourse and rational, compas
sionate thought was Rabbi Hillel, 
who lived in Jerusalem in the 
first century, and whose attribu
tions in the Mishnahs Pirkei Avot 
and in the Talmud have rendered 
him one of the most respected 
interpreters of Jewish law. His 
most famous pronouncement is, 
of course: What is hateful to you, 
do not do to your fellow; that 
is the whole Law: all the rest 
is interpretation. According to 
rabbinical tradition, Rabbi Hillels 
distinction as a teacher is due 
primarily to the openness of his 
students and their willingness to 
consider opposing viewpoints.
His profound contribution to 
the academic culture of the free 
exchange of ideas has impacted 
scholars across the world, not 
merely those interested in Jewish 
thought or history. Unfortunately, 
some groups who claim to act 
in Hillels name need to be re
minded that free thought is pos
sible only when all are allowed to 
speak and be heard, even those 
whose viewpoints may be odi
ous to us. A profound cultural 
amnesia, regrettably, seems to 
afflict many sectors of our mod
ern society, in which the values 
of freedom of discourse are in 
increasingly serious danger of 
being replaced by ideologically 
motivated censorship, creating a 
well-founded fear of retribution 
from those in power. We schol
ars of Carnegie Mellon University 
feel it is in the best interest of all 
to uphold the principles of free 
inquiry guided and shaped by de
monstrable evidence. While stu
dents understandably may wish 
to find their own personal convic
tions reflected in the ideas they 
encounter, it is the work of pro
fessors to challenge ideas, even 
deeply-held ones.
We the undersigned further 
call upon the administration and 
the Faculty Senate to quickly 
agree upon a clarification of the 
Controversial Speakers Policy, 
founded upon the principle that 
the free exchange of ideas is nec
essary to the project of a Univer
sity and of inestimable value to 
the society at large, and strong 
enough to enable the members of 
our administration to protect the
community they steward from 
censorship deriving from within 
or without Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity.

Dining services does something right
KOSHER, from A8
new and better. It took a long 
time, but Parkhurst has pro
vided something wonderful to 
the school. While this change 
may have been slow in coming, 
Parkhurst management is com
mitted to doing something posi
tive for the students of CMU. As 
their contract comes up this year, 
perhaps it is also time look back 
on dining.
Many of us look at dining and 
see only how bad it was our own
freshman year. We think about 
how we were forced to be on a 
meal plan that didnt serve any
thing we wanted. A program so 
confusing it took at least two 
weeks to understand, let alone 
take advantage of. We think of a 
meal plan that had gaping holes 
in it, starving students, and every
one losing money.
Think of the improvements 
that have been made: a late-night 
meal block, the salad bar, Sushi 
Two, Schatz brunch two days a 
week, and many other wonderful
changes. Every year more and 
more students are satisfied with 
dining, and this program is the 
start of satisfying a lot more.
With the Kosher Korner open 
from 11 am until 8 pm every 
weekday, and from 2 until 8 pm 
on weekends, I challenge every 
student to try something kosher. 
Its healthy, cheap, fresh, and 
good food. Whether it be a full 
meal, a Lawrence Special, or 
just some hummus cheaper than 
Entropy, every student can enjoy 
the new addition to dining.

Mens track finishes second at UAAs; women sixth
by Akil Simon
Staffwriter
Battling through inclement 
weather, the mens and womens 
track teams continued to impress 
during their outdoor campaigns. 
The mens team placed second 
of seven teams, just 23 points 
behind champion Washington. 
The women placed fifth in the 
competitive division.
This past weekend marked the 
end of the track season for ath
letes not moving on to national 
competition. The UAA Track and 
Field Championships of 2005 
were hosted by Washington 
University in St. Louis, Mo.
Carnegie Mellon made a strong 
showing on the first day of com
petition, demonstrating their abil
ity to produce results in crunch 
time. After several months of 
development and improvement, 
the Tartans have proven that they 
are one of the most competitive 
teams in the conference.
The men started off the meet 
by scoring in several field events 
on the first day of competition. 
In the high hump, senior Matt 
Dalka, the UAA indoor champion, 
cleared 1.76m for a sixth-place 
finish. Sophomore Eric Tang, 
jumped a distance of 6.52m in 
the long jump to finish in fourth 
place.
Both the men and womens 
weight events have been a 
strength of the Tartan track pro
gram for years. This season, the 
team experienced a season with 
record-breaking performances. 
In the womens hammer throw,
senior Katie Marcoux threw 
37.72m, giving her a third-place 
finish overall. Senior Karoline 
Evans finished slightly behind 
Marcoux with a fifth-place throw 
of 36.72m.
Three of the women walked 
away with points in the shot put 
as well. Sophomore Becky Metier, 
who has continued to improve 
with the progression of the sea
son, finished in third place with a 
throw of 11.27m.
Junior Tom Matta, who has 
been breaking school records 
throughout the year, continued 
his strong performance in the 
mens weight events. In the ham
mer throw, he threw 46.98m to 
give him a second-place finish for 
the day. He also finished second 
in the shot put with his throw of 
13.92m.
After the field events, run
ners competed in heats to deter
mine qualifiers for the finals, 
held on Sunday. On the day of 
preliminaries, graduate student 
Nik Bonaddio led the pack with 
a 48.74 qualifying time in the 
400m dash. In the 200m dash, 
Bonaddio and teammate, sopho
more Russel Verbofsky, qualified 
for the next day of competition 
with respective first and fourthplace qualifying times. Junior 
Jocelyn Sikora finished the 
womens 800m preliminary run 
with a time of 2:20.69, which was 
good enough for her to qualify 
her in second place for Sunday.
Junior K.J. Helmsetter started 
the day off strong for the wom
ens team with a fifth-place fin
ish in the 3000m steeplechase. 
Sikora had a busy second day,
taking third in the 1500m run 
and fourth in the 800m. Junior 
Dana Irrer came up just short in 
the mens 1500m, closing in sec
ond place by just over a second.
In the sprinting events, the 
men responded with a third-place 
finish in a strong 4x100m relay 
finals, where the second and fifth 
place teams were only separated 
by .18 seconds. Hurdlers Nick 
Bannister and first-year Kiley 
Williams continued their strong 
season-long performances by 
claiming second and third in the 
110m hurdles. SophomoreTom 
Kuczynski finished sixth
In the 400m hurdle event, 
Williams ran a season-best 54.66, 
but came in second by .3 seconds. 
Dalka finished right behind him 
in third.
Bonaddio, coming off a strong
preliminary time, came back 
Sunday to win the 400m dash, 
missing breaking his own UAA 
record by just .07 seconds. He 
then returned to beat the field in 
the 200m dash, finished first with 
Verbofsky in third place.
Bonaddio, Verbofsky, Williams, 
and sophomore Mark Davis 
return to dominate the field in 
the 4x400m relay, posting a time 
of 3:20.55.
In the distance events, senior 
Ethan Coffey placed second in 
the mens 5000m run, and junior 
Nick End took first in the 10km 
run. For the women, junior Drea 
Garvue placed fourth in the 
5000m event.

Carnegie Mellon had one 
of its best years in athletics in
2004-2005. From playoff runs to 
conference superiority, national

earned by CMU students for their 
athletic exploits this year. Below

Volleyball
In the last season of nine-year

another ECAC regional title  
their third consecutive  with 
a victory over Lebanon Valley

the UAAs round robin tournament 
in October, which was a decided 
success for the team: They went 
undefeated in the second half of 
the tournament. A fourth place 
finish in the UAA championship 
tournament three weeks later 
earned them an ECAC bid.
Mens Soccer
Six CMU players and the 
teams coaching staff were given 
special UAA honors for their 
work this year that led to their 
12-1-3 record. This gave the 
team a first-place finish in 
the UAA and sent the team to 
another NCAA playoff. The team, 
which earned a bye in the NCAA 
tournament, fell on penalty kicks 
after holding Allegheny College 
(Pa.) 1-1 through two overtimes. 
Sophomores Jonathan Browne 
and Sean Filipovitz and senior 
James Steidel were named allUAA by the conference. The three 
were respectively the top scorers 
on the team. Browne, who broke 
the teams season scoring record, 
is on track to become the teams 
all-time top scorer, needing five 
more goals over two seasons.
Womens Soccer
It was a second-straight ECAC 
tournament victory for CMUs 
womens soccer team this year, 
finishing fourth in the tough 
UAA with a conference record of 
3-3-1. They earned a bye in
the ECAC Southern region and 
used this position to become 
tournament champions. Two 
game-winning goals from junior 
Hallie Dumont pushed them to 
back-to-back 1-0 victories over 
Penn State-Behrend and Johns 
Hopkins for the title. Senior 
keeper Megan Monroe became 
the Tartans career leader in shut
outs with 29 total after 12 this 
year. Losing only Monroe as a 
starter places the team high in 
contention for 2005s UAA title.
Football
The 2004 Carnegie Mellon 
team finished 6-4 (1-2 UAA), 
good enough for third place in 
the conference. Among the 
achievements of the team were 
a pair of dominating wins in non
conference play: first against 
Hiram College (Ohio) in the 
season opener (44-0) and later 
over Bethany College (W.Va.) 
(63-7) alongside three close 
gamesintheUAA. Theyearmarked 
their 30th consecutive non-losing 
season. Among the highlights 
was first-year fullback Travis 
Sivek who  with 745 yards and 
78 points  was named both 
UAA and ECAC Southwest Rookie 
of the Year. Sivek was joined in 
postseason awards by five of
his teammates, including senior 
cornerback Adam Lovrovich who 
was also named to the first team 
by both organizations.
Womens Basketball
Despite a third appearance on 
the all-UAA list by senior forward 
Carissa Sain and team statistic 
leads in six categories by senior 
guard Lisa Seacat, the womens 
basketball team finished with 
only a 4-21 record (0-14 UAA). 
Seacat earned an honorable 
mention with five top-ten 
finishes statistically in the UAA, 
her second in two years. Though 
losing both of these stellar 
players, the team hopes to gain 
in the standings with maturation 
of the young team and return of 
some players from injuries. The 
highlight of the team was a strict 
defense that could force weak 
shots by opponents. Though 
strong, it could not propel them 
to a conference victory. The 
teams best victory of the season 
was a comeback victory over 
Otterbein College (Ohio) early in 
the season.
Mens Basketball
The mens basketball team 
completed one of its best seasons 
ever, competing in the postseason 
play for only the second time ever 
and the first in almost 30 years. 
This run included their first-ever 
playoff victory, a come-frombehind win over Gettysburg in the 
ECAC Southern tournament. The 
19-7 record (10-4 UAA) 
represented the most wins ever 
by the team and its first winning 
conference record since joining 
the UAA. Three players were 
named all-UAA: Junior Nate 
Maurer and senior Michael 
Divens led the team all year and 
each scored their 1000th career 
point this season, while Clayton 
Barlow-Wilcox shone in the 
regular season but especially in 
the playoffs.
Swimming
Senior Chris Pearson took first 
nationally in the 200 butterfly 
and 200 freestyle to lead the CMU 
mens swimming team to a sixthplace finish in the NCAA. Pearsons 
third national championship in 
two years came as the swimming 
teams continued their national 
dominance, finishing eighth 
or better for the last five years. 
Six other mens swimmers 
represented the school at the 
NCAA Division III tournament 
with several other top-ten finishes. 
The teams, having taken several 
top finishes and school records 
at the conference championship 
a month earlier, particularly in 
womens relay events, earned 
two coaching staff awards and 
individual honors for Pearson. On 
the womens side of nationals, 
divers Julie Pavia and Mindy 
Finnegan pulled in a 25th-ranked 
finish for the womens diving 
program.
Outlook
Carnegie Mellons strong 
showing in most of its athletics 
in 2004-2005 bodes well for next 
year. This exciting period in CMU 
athletic history comes also with 
the addition of a new athletic 
director and continued rise in 
profile within the University 
Athletic Association and also 
nationally. Though its far from 
guaranteed what new players and 
coaches will bring next year, small 
turnover in some of the more 
dominant teams ensures that
2005-2006 will be a productive 
and successful campaign.

Carnegie Mellons soccer teams;

where he started.
Crew
Though the teams Governors 
Cup Regatta last weekend was 
canceled, the team still had a 
very busy week. During Carnival, 
the team named three new boats 
that will commemorate some of 
the teams greatest influences.
The first boat was named the 
Class of 2005, after the current 
crop of senior rowers who have 
helped raise the team to a high 
level of competition. Senior Gary 
Feigenbaum, a four-year team 
member who will be compet
ing in this summers Maccabiah 
Games, commented on the work 
of his team before the naming:
The class of 2005 did noth
ing more exceptional than any 
other previous class to row 
for Carnegie Mellon; we sim
ply started rowing at the right 
time.... We found an ambitious 
and motivated varsity team, 
and a new coach willing to pro
vide the structure to take the 
team where it wanted to go. It is
thanks to them that we are able 
to receive this honor. 
Feigenbaum continued, Our 
boathouse is unrecognizable 
compared to the one we arrived 
at four years ago, with a multi
tude of newer, faster boats. All 
of these changes are not due 
to any remarkable effort on our 
behalf; we simply helped take 
the team where it wanted to go. 
We are very proud to have rep
resented Carnegie Mellon dur
ing such a tremendous time of 
growth and achievement, and 
we hope that this trend will con
tinue. It is exciting to imagine 
where the team will be when we 
come back to visit.
The two other boats were 
named the Abigail Simon, 
after the children of alumnus 
Marc Rosten, and the Donald 
Webber-Plank. Webber-Plank 
will leave his head coaching 
spot this year after four success
ful seasons with the team.
The team returns May 7 for the 
Mid-Atlantic Championships.

Heavier than elephant balls.
These are the words that flash through my 
mind as I blast this CD in my car at 3 am in the 
morning. Out of my speakers and from the ashes 
of post-modern metal rises Bloodsimple. In the 
90s, while Panteras Great Southern TrendkilT 
was in full swing, a little band named Vision of 
Disorder trampled the line between emotional 
and heavy. Blurred it for all bands today, in fact. 
Now that the Slipknots and SOADs of the world 
rule the airwaves, it seems appropriate that one 
of the originators of heavy metal lays it all out 
once again.
When Tim (vox) and Mike (gee-tars) 
announced that they were continuing their 
musical association beyond the missed V.O.D., 
expectations among fans and critics ran high. 
Adding a classically trained musician turned 
producer to the roster did nothing but amplify 
those expectations. Would it be another horrible 
metal ego trip gone awry? Or would it soar?
Seriously? It soars.
Imagine the mythical 10-ton hammer 
swung straight into your skull, and you 
can visualize the opening strains of 
Straight Hate. You can also imagine 
the reaction of the fine citizens of Squirrel 
Hill this morning as I blasted Bloodsimple in 
my car, but no matter. The path followed is 
one bored through mountains by solid riffs. 
Bludgeoning the listener, it let up for a second as 
it segues into Path To Prevail, another monster 
in the vein of V.O.D..What if I Lost It, the next 
. slab o metal, is more than a rhetorical question. 
At this point, I havent felt this much aggression 
since Metallica decided to get haircuts.
The tinny resonance of Tim Williams voice 
complements the aggro of his compatriots 
here. As the album slows down and settles 
into the emotional part of heavy (it seems to 
actually exist, surprisingly), its hard to come 
down from the aggressive high. Still, it works. 
Williams voice soothes and seethes as the songs 
weave a complex path. The Leaving Song is 
a melancholy ode to lost love and the ensuing 
depression. This one could probably find a home 
on modern rock radio, but why? Personally, I 
find the best antidote to lost love is loud music 
and a new love. Bloodsimple seems to follow this 
plan, getting up off the floor and launching into 
Cruel World. Break stuff, yeah, yeah break it!
Then comes the last trio of songs. Flatlined, with 
its gentie composition and electronic backbeat, 
is an interesting addition to the mix. Perhaps not 
what one would expect, but definitely daring. 
Falling Backwards is classical V.O.D., straight
ahead aggro. As the album closes with Plunder, 
haunting vocals are bathed in acoustic guitars, 
and the result is beautiful.
A Cruel World starts off angry and violent but 
ends softly and introspectively. A difficult birth 
that ends peacefully, and a landmark debut 
album. Probably the most challenging metal 
album since Machine Heads Through The Ashes 
of Empires, this is one you must check out.
Til next time,

Bloodsimples A Cruel World takes former members of the 1990s group Vision of Disorder, and adds a 
classically trained musician to the mix. The result? Pure adrenaline-fueled aggression.

April 26,1955
Twelve campus sororities prepared campaigns for the title of Carnival Queen. Sorority 
women were making posters, creating costumes, and choreographing dances in 
preparation for the elections. Some campaigns included Alpha Epsilon Phi sisters 
wearing yellow rain slickers for a week regardless of the weather; Chi Omegas WildWest campaign, in which sisters walked around with fake guns; Sigma Kappas pirate 
theme, in which sisters dressed as pirates; and Delta Delta Deltas theme of suit your 
fancy with Marilyn and Nancy, in which sisters acted like the sophisticated woman 
for a week.

April 22,1980
Camegie-Mellon University raised tuition by $700. The Tuition Committee, which 
consisted of faculty and staff, presented their findings to a group of student leaders 
and President Cyert. Cyert supported the hike, believing that some people judge a 
school by the tuition, and that raising tuition would raise the prestige of CarnegieMellon. This would appear to be one of the first instances of an administrators 
publicly stating this belief, and it remains unclear whether or not people knew of this 
decision when they chose to name a building after him.

Student Senate violated its own bylaws by failing to publish a list of organizations 
requesting funding. The Student Senate bylaws required that Senate publish the list 
created by the Funding and Recognition committee in The Tartan and The Student Union

claimed that he had sent an e-mail to the leaders of several student organizations, 
which he felt fulfilled the intentions of the bylaws.

Pittsburghs worst restaurants
OMr scnifr rcstaMrant rcvicwcr givcs hcr ~ast hMrrah in a shft at thc oBMrghos wfrst dining
Restaurant reviews are notoriously kind. But after spend
ing months telling you where to eat in Pittsburgh, I want 
to let you know where you should not eat. Let me clarify, 
though: I only focused on restaurants that claim to be 
good and are not. At places like the O and Ritters Diner, 
there are no claims that the food tastes good. The res
taurants below are more like carnival rides; at first, they 
seem appealing. But just because your friends are going 
doesnt mean youre just going to have less money in your 
pocket afterwards: youll also have an upset stomach.
India Garden
India Garden has, by far, the worst waiters in all of Pitts
burgh. The service here is truly atrocious. Unlike other 
ethnic restaurants where the menu is enthusiastically 
explained, India Garden workers just dont care. I have 
dined there with a group of Indians who tried in vain to 
engage with the waiters in Hindi when asking about spe
cific dishes. I have also been there with Americans who 
meekly asked the waiters the differences between one 
dish and another  to no response. In fact, the waiters 
did not respond to either group and gave everyone the 
same rude treatment. At least they dont discriminate.
The menu itself is characteristic of low-end Indian res
taurants, featuring the same standard dishes as Taste of 
India and Indian Oven. Most of their vegetable dishes are 
so overcooked that they have the consistency of mush. In
dia Garden draws a large half-priced food crowd since it 
was the only Indian food that was half-priced for a while. 
However, last week I discovered the newly opened restau
rant, Bombay Palace, on nearby Semple Street. Not only is 
the food significantly better than India Garden, but their 
half-price starts at 9:30 pm.
Joe Mamas
Joe Mamas is a mediocre restaurant at best. I like to think
of it as a crappier version of the Olive Garden. Its like 
they took something bad, and made it worse. If you want 
real Italian food, try Girasole in Shadyside. If you want 
half-priced food, the pasta selections at Fuel and Fuddle 
are much better than those offered at Joe Mamas. Expe
rience has led me to believe that even a dish like spaghetti 
is better at Eat n Park than at Joe Mamas.
The Cheesecake Factory
The Cheesecake Factory is a horrible restaurant in ways 
too numerous to count. I can guarantee you that you will 
have to wait an unreasonably long time to be seated, re
gardless of when you go. Because the restaurant doesnt 
take reservations, you have no choice but to wait for up to 
two hours to be seated.
The atmosphere inside is that of a giant eating ware
house. There are no intimate tables and no secluded 
booths where you can enjoy a meal in peace. This is a res
taurant dreamt up for suburbanites who like everything 
big, bland, and loud. In fact, most of the diners seemed 
to have flocked to the Cheesecake Factory from outside 
of Pittsburgh.
As for the food: Everything on the menu is good, but 
nothing is spectacular. Furthermore, one entree can feed 
a family of four. No joke, I have been there with my fam
ily and the four of us ordered one appetizer, one entre, 
and one dessert. The noise level of the restaurant, with 
screaming kids and noisy families, makes you feel like 
you are back in a summer camp mess hall. Better food can 
be had elsewhere in the South Side.
Zyng
Ive said it before and I will say it again, Zyng is a horrible 
mutation of pan-Asian food. If you want real Asian food, 
there are already Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese restaurants in Squirrel Hill that are just as cheap and 
much tastier. Dont be fooled by Zyngs glossy exterior: 
The food is a bland American take on pan-Asian.
The Melting Pot
The Melting Pot in Station Square may initially seem ap
pealing, as it is a fondue-themed restaurant. Do not be 
tempted. On the night I dined there, the restaurant was 
filled with people on dates who had never eaten there 
before: a dangerous sign. Upon being seated, I found the 
prices to be astronomical for the type of food offered. To 
eat a full meal at the Melting Pot, be prepared to spend 
around $40-50 per person.
Furthermore, the wait staff is overly insistent. My waiter, 
a Pitt student, proceeded to talk to my table for 30 min
utes about how he was getting into real estate invest
ments. He then continued with his hard sell of the deluxe 
dinner package, around $65 per person  which we re
peatedly declined. Upscale romantic restaurants in Pitts
burgh are plentiful. The next time you are looking for a 
good date restaurant, try one of the South Sides other 
establishments like Le Pommier: a fraction of the price for 
exponentially better food.
Cozumel
I only go to Cozumel for drinks, but every time I go I am 
shocked at the number of people actually eating there. 
Cozumel claims to be authentic Mexican food. I have to 
disagree. Refried beans that come out of a can and lots 
of cheese do not make food Mexican. Not only is the cost 
high and the portion size small, but the food looks and 
tastes like someone bought it cheap from Taco Bell and 
rearranged it on a plate.

Happenstance travels through heartache and back
A trfss bctwccn Mithc~~c Branth and A~itia KcPs, Rathc~ Yaiagataos a~bMi is sfM~fM~ and swcct
Some people perceive a broken heart as nothing highly 
unusual. To others, a broken heart is a painful reminder 
of what could have been. For 27-year-old Rachael 
Yamagata, love and failed relationships contribute to 
a collection of songs inspired through the turmoil of 
falling for someone, being in love, and finding out that he 
isnt the one. Yamagatas debut album, Happenstance, 
explores the obsession, chaos, and agony of falling in love 
only to be left in the end with remnants of a broken past.
Although highly reminiscent of Michelle Branchs debut 
album, Yamagata takes a less mainstream approach in 
her album of heartache. Instead of playing the role of 
the typical angst-ridden girl riding the roller coaster of 
teenage-dom, Yamagata leads us back down memory 
lane through the eyes of a girl  a hopeless romantic  
who has traveled down the same road more than twice. 
Happenstance is packed with 13 tracks, featuring music 
and lyrics mostly written by Yamagata herself.
It is apparent that Yamagata is unlike many of the current 
rising pop queens vying for a piece of the music scene. 
Her husky and soulful voice remind us of the age of Billie 
Holiday, where talent and singing about things that 
mattered were the keys towards generating a wide fan 
base. Yamagatas musical talents dazzle listeners upfront 
with the less emotionally intense song Be Be Your 
Love. If there is one thing that listeners will learn, its 
that although Yamagata may be afraid of falling in love,
shes not afraid to take leaps in music. The confidence 
that is reflected in her voice, as well as the various voice 
techniques and moods she incorporates into this song, is 
sure to leave the audience in awe.
The music in Happenstance can be divided into two 
categories: soulful jazz and jazzy pop. Yamagata manages 
to create a harmonious balance between the two and 
delivers a relatively good sampling of her musical abilities. 
A note of warning for listeners looking for extremely 
upbeat jazz music: This is not the album for you. Quite 
frankly, Happenstance is not for the lighthearted. It is 
for those who have loved and loved deeply, but found 
themselves left behind with nothing but empty memories. 
Most important, this is an album for the person who is 
embittered from failed past relationships and hardened 
by the trials of love. For these listeners, Yamagata offers 
them the hope and courage to believe in love again.
Another noteworthy aspect of Happenstance is the powerful 
instrumentals. Yamagatas assembly of talented artists 
becomes apparent from the actual musical components 
of the album. Throwing dramatics into the background 
and creating tension and discordance when necessary are 
signature elements of Yamagatas music style. While most 
newcomer bands and artists misuse these techniques, 
Yamagatas flair is undeniable. The resulting product is 
an album that has not only strong vocal talent, but also a 
moving and haunting instrumental presence.
The one thing about Yamagatas debut album that needs 
to be strengthened is the imagery used in her lyrics. For 
the most part, Yamagata is successful in communicating 
very intense and vivid feelings through instrumental and 
vocal techniques. In terms of lyrics, another degree of 
power through music can be added to further emphasize 
the main message. Although her songs are very frank, 
and appeal to most audiences because of the parallels 
between her relationships and those of her listeners, 
lyrics such as I want you/Or no one/No one else for 
me/Yes, you or no one undermine Yamagatas talents. 
On the other hand, songs like Paper Doll (Theyll dress 
you up for the flight/Like Ophelia, you wave goodnight/ 
With the earth and sky you cheer and cry/Writhe as all 
your days go by/And laugh as you die) make good use of 
imagery and illusions, thus creating a poetic rhythm that 
further contributes to the soulful atmosphere prevalent 
throughout Yamagatas album.
Despite all the heartaches Yamagata has experienced, 
she still believes that everything has a purpose. Behind 
all the sorrow, discordance, and miscommunication of 
which Yamagata sings, Happenstance is actually an album 
that is secretly rooting for love despite the overshadowing 
presence of pain and heartache.

Behind the scenes of Dancers Symposium
Organizatifnos ianP icibcrs tfic tfgcthcr tf pMt fn CMUos ~argcst scicstcr~P dantc shfw
If youve been to Dancers
Symposium (DS) in your time at 
Carnegie Mellon, you know to come 
to the show early. Often the line of 
students, faculty, and community 
members creeps back toward Si 
Seor or winds around the eating 
areas of the UC toward Schatz half 
an hour before the show.
Every semester, DS brings a 
combination of dances to the 
Rangos stage, with styles as varied 
as hip-hop and Irish hardshoe, 
both of which will be in next 
weeks spring performance of DS.
Prospective dancers gather at the 
start of each semester to audition; 
choreographers show 35 counts 
of their work in progress and the 
dancers choose numbers for which 
theyd like to audition. The directors 
of DS, who are usually seasoned 
members of the organization, help 
keep track of choreographers and 
dancers progress on the dances; 
they also help manage practice 
spaces and work with lighting.
So why do so many people flock to see 
DS each semester? According to Tria Chang, who has 
been both a dancer and a co-choreographer in DS, it is 
due in part to the size of the organization. A lot of people 
in the audience are going to support their friends, Chang 
said; because DS is a large organization, the dancers 
friend base is a sort-of built-in audience. Chang, who is a 
sophomore in humanities and arts, also said, I think a lot 
of people in the audience end up being in the auditions.... 
I always encourage people who go [as audience members] 
to also audition.
Perhaps another reason for the monumental size of the 
audience is the variety of the dances. Kelly McLaughlin, a 
senior in social and decision sciences, is a DS director as 
well as a co-choreographer on a piece this semester with 
Melissa Blohm, a junior in business administration.
McLaughlin, who has worn the hats of choreographer, 
dancer, and director during her years in DS, weighed in 
on how this years DS was shaping up: Actually [in] this 
DS it seems we have a ton of variety in our show. In terms 
of quality I think the quality of the dances is quite high.... 
Theres really something that everyone could enjoy seeing. 
The production quality of our show has really gone up in 
this show particularly. McLaughlin gave some examples 
of this semesters variety of dances, which include hipof three dances. Gering is cochoreographing a modern ballet 
piece set to Frou Frous Let Go, 
from the Garden State soundtrack. 
Her co-choreographer is Kristan 
Hoffman, a sophomore in SHS. 
Gering is participating in as wide 
a range of dances as possible; 
she is also in a combination Irish 
hardshoe and tap piece, which, she 
said, creates a sort of battle of all 
the rhythms going back and forth. 
Her final performance will be in a 
more traditional jazz-style piece 
co-choreographed by Nikki Bush, 
a senior biology major, and Nuelsi 
Pales, a masters in public policy and 
management. This last piece is set 
to the Van Halen version of You 
Really Got Me Now.
Tria Chang gravitates more toward 
hip-hop dances, which Gering 
mentioned were some of the most 
popular dances during auditions. 
Chang is also helping a friend, 
Ellein Cheng, a senior math major, 
to teach a dance that Cheng brought 
Vanessa shyu/Art staff back from Hong Kong. Its like 
jazz funk style, very fast and very 
difficult, said Chang.
This semester, the directors are trying to prevent the 
disconnect between dancers that can result from having 
so many different dances and practices in so many 
different areas of the University, said Chang, Gering, and 
McLaughlin. Gering explained that because practices are 
held at different times and in different locations, members 
of DS often do not know one another. All three members 
agree that directors have been coordinating more social 
events and an atmosphere that encourages more people 
to get to know one another.
With a new push toward a tighter friendship among 
members, this springs Dancers Symposium can hope to 
attract even more people to the organization. The more 
integrated people feel, said Gering, the more they will 
want to come back. For those who simply watch DS each 
semester, the variety of styles might draw them in, or just 
knowing what the program was like in previous years. If 
youre coming because you know someone ... hopefully if 
they stopped being in it youd come back, said Gering.

hop, Indian, modern, and jazz styles, among others. 
According to McLaughlin, the quality of production in DS 
has mainly gone up due to budget increases.
Fighting the crowd can be worth it; this years semester of 
DS has a lot to offer. The piece that McLaughlin and Blohm 
are choreographing is one that McLaughlin believes is 
unique to DS. Of the style, McLaughlin said, We have a 
very difficult piece. We arent using counts because of how 
the music works.... Because its a drum piece, we cant use 
counts. Its been a really hard learning process. However, 
the piece will stand out not only because of its all-drum 
instrumental, but also because of its subject matter. We 
call it animalistic sex, added McLaughlin, who noted 
that the piece was both raw and fun to perform. Cheryl 
Gering, a junior psychology major, who is a dancer in the 
piece, added that it begins with a recording of the dancers 
breathing. The recording was done by CMUs own WRCT 
and will play before the drum piece.
In addition to the racy drum piece are many other dances 
which, as the choreographers suggested, run almost 
the entire the range of possible styles. Gering is in the 
most number of dances allowed to any choreographer: 
A total of four. She explained that dancers who have not 
choreographed are allowed to participate in a maximum6Pillbox. 25 April 2005.

a key part of rebuilding glass into a vital and popular 
element of Pittsburghs culture. Before the invention 
of plastic diminished the need for glass, Pittsburgh 
remained at the center of the glass market. The work 
done here made its way around the world: The glass 
lining the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in New York 
City comes from Pittsburgh, and even the tableware of 
many Presidents, such as Andrew Jackson and Franklin 
Roosevelt, was made out of Pittsburgh glass.
Firing a century of innovation
Pittsburghs proximity to major sources of water made it a 
breeding ground for factories in the past; in the mid-1800s, 
circa the years of the Civil War, glass was a major industry 
in the area. In 1905, Pittsburghs most prominent glass 
company, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, introduced a new type 
of glass: Carrara. Carrara, marketed as a sanitary glass, 
didnt retain odors and was easy to clean. Bathrooms and 
kitchens in homes and businesses throughout the United 
States began using it. Even the Woolworth Building in 
New York City sought it out: The building became the first 
ever to have an entirely Carrara-made restroom.
As Pittsburgh became more renowned for its innovative 
glassware, the citys influence began to extend beyond just 
the 50 states. Today, the Pittsburgh Glass Center brings 
in artists from all over the world who use the facilities 
to display their work and teach students. The students 
will come from anywhere in the world, said Johnese. 
Weve had students from Korea, from Colombia ... from 
36 states. Our instructors come from the Czech Republic, 
from Australia; we have two teachers from Mexico coming 
up to teach in May; were all over the map.
Johnese explained what brings people to the Pittsburgh 
facility: We have a specialty  its not in the technique, 
its in the facility itself. The facility is just loved by 
everyone who comes here.
The Pittsburgh Glass Center is a large brick building that 
holds five different studios crucial to glassblowing and 
other glass-related art work, containing many things 
most artists cant have in their own homes. Among the 
studios are flame, hot, tech, and cold shops, as well as a 
casting studio. In the flame shop, artists can use torches 
to melt and combine glass, processes essential for making 
marbles, beads, and pendants, as well as for detailing
'p
Sh
L
Pittsburgh hasnt always been known as the Steel City, 
as it is today. What it used to be known for is a lot more 
fragile: glass.
Thanks to Andrew Carnegie and his influence in the steel 
industry, Pittsburgh blossomed into a major economic 
powerhouse in the early 1900s. Although the amount of 
steel actually produced in Pittsburgh has greatiy declined, 
Steel City remains a nickname that means something to 
everyone. Very few people, though, remember the times 
when Pittsburgh was called the Glass City; when the 
Burgh was the hub of the nations entire glass industry.
While the steel market is in the process of disappearing, 
the glass market may very well be making a comeback, 
but with a twist.
Though there are few mass-production glass factories 
still running in the greater Pittsburgh area, the 20thcentury industry has seen a fundamental shiftfrom the 
functional and practical applications of a post-industrial
society to an artistic medium of expression. The new 
Pittsburgh Glass Center attracts artists from all over the 
world and is slowly but surely creating a major impact on 
the Pittsburgh art and glass scenes.
Why bring a major public-access studio, one of just four of 
its kind in the nation, to Pittsburgh? Its all based on the 
community in which the Pittsburgh Glass Center resides: a 
few cramped blocks along Penn Avenue called Friendship. 
Its here that the rebirth of glass popularity in Pittsburgh 
is centered  and its revitalizing the community around 
it, as well. The influence the Pittsburgh Glass Center 
has had on the community is clear: Within the next 
two years, this [area] will change dramatically, said 
Karen Johnese, the executive director at the Pittsburgh 
Glass Center. When we came here we were the largest 
arts organization on Penn Avenue, so were considered a 
cornerstone on this avenue.
The Pittsburgh Glass Center has been an essential part of 
rebuilding the community of Friendship  and its also

larger objects. The hot shop contains several huge glowing 
furnaces and several warming chambers where classic 
glassblowing takes place. The cold shop is for polishing, 
engraving, and sandblasting, while casting glass, which 
is how most of the best glass artists work with glass, takes 
place in the casting studio. Lastly, the tech studio serves 
as a place to work with metal.
The Pittsburgh Glass Center was organized with just that, 
and more, in mind. An excellent facility was important, 
but more important was that the facility be in an area 
that would harbor artistry. Friendship was selected to 
be the location of one of the best glassblowing studios in 
the world. We needed to be in a diverse neighborhood, 
because art fits with diversity, Johnese said. People 
are more creative when theyre confronted with a broad 
range of ideas, and this is a neighborhood that wants to 
do better. It needs improvement, and seeks improvement 
through the artists.
Finding a home in Friendship
Certainly Friendship is beginning to provide that kind of 
atmosphere, but the areawhich is near Lawrencevilles 
Design Zone [see Design Zone breathes new life into 
Lawrenceville, Pillbox, 3/28]  hasnt been considered 
a pleasant, safe area in a long time. Only recentiy have 
art-oriented businesses such as architecture firms and 
the Pittsburgh Glass Center 
begun to line the streets. A large
 but diminishing  number of 
vacant, run-down buildings still 
occupy Friendship. The town 
that was once a high-traffic area 
may be making a comeback.
The 1950s and 1960s found 
Friendship as a fairly high-class 
area, rich in mostiy European 
diversity. Unfortunately, the 
1970s created turmoil in 
Friendship: A set of large 
buildings was erected that made 
through travel impractical, and 
with Penn Avenue blocked 
off, people began avoiding 
Friendship altogether. As traffic 
dwindled and local jobs in the 
mills and foundries disappeared, 
the entire community began a 
rapid decline.
Crime and prostitution took 
hold of the neighborhood for the 
better part of two decades, until
the families of Friendship took "f f '!;er,uniq!!e Pieces.............. , . , Pittsburgh Glass Center.the initiative to make it a better _____________________
place. Recently, locals interested in 
helping the arts to flourish banded 
together to evolve the Friendship 
Development Associates (FDA), an 
organization critical to the Glass 
Centers success  and critical to 
the future of glass in Pittsburgh. 
Johnese said that the FDA created 
an arts initiative [the Penn Avenue 
Arts Initiative] ... that helps 
[artists] find buildings. By putting 
various studios in the area, the 
neighborhood began a renaissance.
Vacancies are decreasing. Since 
the Pittsburgh Glass Center arrived 
on the block in 2000, the corridor 
along Penn Avenue has gone from 
30 percent vacancies to 17 percent 
vacancies.
The University connection
The Pittsburgh Glass Center helps 
the area prosper and develop by 
bringing outsiders in; not .only 
does it attract the attention of the 
international glass world, but it is 
slowly beginning

Students in high ---------------------------
school may apply
to participate in a 10-week course, 
and Carnegie Mellon University 
students can take classes there for 
credit. Weve had students from CMU 
in the engineering department ... 
from all different departments of the 
school. Not just design students, said 
Johnese of the crowd the Pittsburgh 
Glass Center attracts. They also offer 
weekend workshops and summer 
courses, each taught by professionally 
trained glass artists, some of whom 
move from out of the area just for the 
sake of the facility and opportunities 
available through the Glass Center.
The Glass Center provides a place to 
grow as an artist and participate in 
what is shaping up to be the future 
of glass. Anyone can be a glass artist, 
providing the right mix of technical 
skill and artistic training. Johnese 
pointed out that although her husband

a finished vase created in the hot shop.
hadnt worked with glass until 
recently, he was still able to make 
a beautiful orange transparent 
vessel. The point here is to become 
your own artist, she said.
There are so many possibilities in 
glass  its truly the most exciting, 
most innovative form of art in the 
world today, Johnese said. Were 
growing a colony of glass artists 
who do their own individual work. 
This is the rebirth of glass in a new 
form. It is certainly helping to 
change the environment around 
glass and in Pittsburgh.
The future of glass
For over 70 years during the midto late 1800s, Pittsburgh hosted 
annual glass tableware shows. 
These shows were the first places 
for people to see new glass 
works from around the world, 
bringing together both artists and 
consumers. Mirroring that past, 
the Pittsburgh Glass Center is 
bringing artists, consumers, and 
other glass admirers together for 
a huge event called the Summer 
of Glass in 2007. The long list
---------------------------- of participating organizations
includes the Carnegie Museum, 
which will present a major exhibit, along with the Society 
of Contemporary Craft, the Three Rivers Arts Festival, 
and the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Major glass artists 
will exhibit their work, including the most prominent 
glass artist of the day, Dale Chihuly, whose work will be 
displayed in the Phipps Conservatory during the Summer 
of Glass festivities. Approximately two thousand glass 
enthusiasts will be brought together for the Glass Arts 
Society Conference, which will also be held in Pittsburgh 
in 2007.
I think the most exciting thing that were able to 
accomplish here is to bring to Pittsburgh a very special 
group of people, said Johnese. In order to work in glass, 
one needs to be both artistically and technologically 
savvy. Most glassworkers are artists, scientists, and 
thinkers. The benefit, she said, is that most of these people 
are young; and that is exactiy what Pittsburgh needs.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Now that Wilbur felt confident with his physique, he couldnt wait to go on 
the cruise. He went shopping for flip-flops, a new bathing suit and other 
deckwear. He got SPF 45 sunscreen for his bill, which always burns and never 
tans. He lined up all of his luggage next to his door a week before he had to 
leave for the cruise, which departed from Miami. Every day he glanced at the 
luggage on his way out the door to work and mentally checked that he had 
everything he would need. Wilbur was tremendously eager to get away from 
his humdrum routine. Finally the day came. The taxi arrived outside his 
house to take him to the airport. Wilbur headed outside, carefully making 
sure his door was securely locked. He hadnt made it to the bottom of his 
stoop when he slipped on a patch of ice. His bags flew every which way as 
he desperately grasped for the railing. His flailings were in vain, however. 
In the blink of an eye, Wilbur was on his back on the sidewalk, unmoving.

HOROSCOPES
BY ASHLEIGH MOLZ
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): The next month or so is going to be full of 
depression for you. Good luck overcoming it.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): The stars tell me that youre unhappy and 
you don't know why. There is nothing you can do about it until the stars 
move a little to the right (which may take a month or so).
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): If youre in a relationship, make sure to 
pay attention to your lover through the next few weeks. No matter how 
overwhelmed you feel, you need him. He is probably feeling the same 
way and needs you too. If you are single, its about time you found 
someone so you can worry incessantly about how well you are treating the 
person and how badly he treats you. What a loser you must be.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Watch out, you're going to be really 
stressed out from now until mid-May. The stars forebode it!
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Mark my words, if you have a habit of eating 
rich ice cream when youre stressed out, you must break yourself of it 
now! If you don't know what Im talking about, thats a good thing.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Your TA accidentally slept through 
your recitation last week. He didnt mean to do it and hes really sorry. 
Please forgive him.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): When I was seeing your immediate 
future in the stars last night, I had an epiphany! The reason you like 
eating yellow-colored, sour foods so much is because you are the 
reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe! (Dont ask me how that relates; the 
stars have their reasons and they do not divulge them.)
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): For the next three weeks you 
will temporarily lose your mind, but dont worry, it will come back to you. 
Eventually.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): In the next few hours you 
will be eating a lot of cheese. Its okay. Enjoy yourself.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Unlike everyone else, you 
actually have been preparing yourself for the next month since early 
March. Congratulations! You are going to fly through the next few weeks 
with the greatest of ease, and the fruits of your reward will be plentiful. 
Good job.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Get ready for a long haul. There 
is nothing you can do about it.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): This week is your last week of 
pseudo-freedom (you know, that thing you call your normal life, which 
really consists of stress, worry, constant work, nerdy pastimes, and an 
occasional hangover), so cherish it for all that its worth. Im sorry if its 
not worth that much to you. And I cant promise you it will get better.

Comickaze
Flight of fantasy
Image Comics Flight II shipped this week. It is an eclectic 
anthology of comics by quasi-mainstream artists, and 
younger, self-published internet talent. The first volume 
was a little skimpy and over-hyped, so I wasnt as excited 
about the second installment as everyone else. The stories 
in the first were short and underdeveloped; it wasnt hitand-miss like some anthologies, just bland.
FlightII is a pleasant surprise. The stories are longer, and the 
number of artists involved has more than doubled. Critical 
mass has been achieved. The result is 427 pages of unusual 
and original comics that have kept me reading for days.
Flight is the brainchild of its editor, Kazu Kibuishi. Kibuishi 
is a poster-boy for successful web comics; his comic Copper 
is still self-published and distributed freely online at his 
website www.boltcity.com. Flight I was his first foray into 
print, and introduced a lot of previously unpublished 
online comic artists to print. He is also socially active in the 
whole comics community, and has the connections to really 
make these kinds of projects come true. His first graphic 
novel, Daisy Cutter: The Last Train, came out at this past 
summers Comicon and has been selling solidly ever since. 
His style has manga influences, like many online comics, 
but is not strictly dominated by that paradigm. His drawing 
style is very animated, and uses several techniques like 
stretch-and-squish and moment-to-moment transitioning. 
Kibuishis contribution to the contemporary discourse on 
comics grows every year, and always becomes better and 
stronger.
Kibuishi managed to bring many famous, established 
comics professionals into this anthology. Since the projects 
are smaller in scope, and much more personal, we get a 
fresh perspective on the artists and their work that isnt 
apparent in their larger projects. Jeff Smith, the creator, 
writer, and artist for the entire Bone series, contributed a fun 
little story about two star-travelers, Sirius and Betelgeuse. 
Doug TenNapel, the author of Creature Tech and creator 
of Earthworm Jim, contributed Solomon Fix, a bland little 
story, but with brushwork as beautiful as a Bill Watterson 
landscape. Don Hertzfeldt, the infamous Bitter Films 
animator, creator of Rejected, and host of The Animation 
Show, contributed several surreal one-panel strips in his 
very unique style. Finally, Sonny Liew, the Singapore video
game designer and Xeric-Award winning author of Malinky 
Robot, contributed a short Malinky story, Dead Souls Day 
Out, that still hasnt lost the powerful fantasy-world feel of 
the original.
More interesting, though, is the fresh meat. Niel Babra, 
a local Pittsburgh cartoonist whose comics I first saw in 
The Free Times, continued his Taj Mahal story from Flight I
with The Golden Temple. The gesture and caricature of the 
characters are interesting and original, and his use of color 
makes good sense both as an expressive device and as 
a formal visual element. He has a Gilbert Hernandezlike approach to people and places in his story that really 
resonates with me.
Becky Cloonans Heads Up is a real visual feast. The 
characters in this sexualized Mexican standoff have a 
Carla-Speed-McNiels-Fmder quality to them. The layout 
is very designed, however, with the background acting 
more like a foreground and overlapping between scenes. 
Text acts like images, images act like symbols, and it all 
weaves together in this ambiguous, dreamlike way. The 
colors are subdued, non-local, and surreal. Reading it as a 
story is straightforward, but when I turned the pages back 
again and looked at them just as images and enjoyed it a 
lot more.
Not all the comics were hits, though. Several of the them 
had the same kind of warm-and-fuzzy theme of friendship 
or happiness or tranquility that pervaded the first book. 
Not to sound like an existentialist, but one can only read so 
many four-to-five page comics in a row about ambiguous 
characters finding ambiguous contentment after a curt 
uplifting conversation with a cute animal or wise elder. 
Catia Chens Jelly Fruit, Jake Parkers The Robot and the 
Sparrow, or Jen Wangs Destiny Express all had beautiful 
artworkespecially Parkerbut they left me wishing for 
a deeper, more human story. Ryan Sias Blip Pop and Amy 
Kim Gantes A Test for Genri, on the other hand, had art that 
simply turned me off before I could even think about the 
story. The styles were lifted right out of television cartoons, 
and didnt really have a personal language of their own. 
Four-to-five-page comics succeed based on how personal 
they are to the creator, and these didnt have that hook.
Other artists in the book that I like whom Id never heard 
of before were Rad Sechrist, whose steampunkish Ghost 
Trolley story had a the feel of a more boisterous Miyazaki, 
and Richard Poses Beisbol was a good contemplative 
cultural story to put near the end of the book.
As an art object, the book is pulsing with great new visual 
ideas. Incidentally, Kibuishi has also arranged a gallery 
show for lots of the original art from this book at Gallery 
Nucleus in Alhambra California thats hanging right now. 
Photos are up on his website. McSweeneys Quarterly 
Concern was The Book for comics last year, but this year its 
totally Flight.
