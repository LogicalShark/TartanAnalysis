More international students deciding to enroll at 
American universities, including Carnegie Mellon
by Syeda Sara Abbas
Junior Staffwriter
International and non-res
ident alien students compose 
28 percent of Carnegie Mellons 
student body, according to uni
versity enrollment data. Foreign 
student enrollment has increased 
5.5 percent since 2005, according 
to statistics released by Carnegie 
Mellons Office of International 
Education.
The term international or 
foreign student has a variety of 
definitions.
We see a range of applicants, 
said Lisa Krieg, director of the Of
fice of International Education. 
Among the 22,000 students who 
applied to Carnegie Mellon this 
year, there were U.S. citizens 
who grew up abroad, foreign 
students on temporary visas who 
were raised in the U.S., American 
students who grew up in ethnic 
pockets, and foreign students 
holding diplomatic passports

who grew up in several countries. 
Complicating the situation, there 
were international students on 
F-l/J-1 visas and newly arrived 
immigrants with green cards.
Thus, visa status gives only 
part of the picture of the intel
lectual and cultural background 
of the student, said Krieg, whose 
office handles visa queries for for
eign students.
About 58 percent of inter
national students at American 
colleges and universities are 
from South Asian countries, par
ticularly China, India, and Korea, 
according to the Institute of Inter
national Education.
The statistics at Carnegie Mel
lon mirror this national trend
 75 percent of international 
students come from Asia, most 
commonly India, China, and 
Korea.
The number of Indian under
graduate students has increased 
17 percent since fall 2006.

Record numbers choosing to go abroad, survey says
by Sabrina Porter
Assistant News Editor
The results are in: More col
lege students are using their 
passports and foreign tongues 
than ever before. The number 
of students at U.S. colleges and 
universities choosing to study 
abroad increased 8.5 percent 
over the past academic year, 
according to a survey released 
Tuesday by the Institute of In
ternational Education. This is a 
150 percent rise compared to 10 
years ago, the survey said.
In addition, student en
rollment in foreign language 
courses at colleges and univer
sities has increased 13 percent, 
according to a study by the Mod
ern Language Association that 
was also released Tuesday. The 
study surveyed approximately 
2800 colleges and universities 
that regularly teach languages.
The first survey, Open Doors 
2007, is an annual report of the
study abroad activities of over 
200 universities. The study also 
reported an increase in the di
versity of the countries in which 
students are choosing to study.
Nationally, student travel to 
Latin America, Asia, and the 
Middle East increased by 26 
percent, 19 percent, and 31 per
cent, respectively.
Europe continued to lead the 
way, accounting for just over 50 
percent of the students choices 
of destination.
These trends are clearly seen 
in the Carnegie Mellon data.
According to the Office of 
International Education, the 
number of students studying 
abroad has increased from 215 
to 260 since 2002, and by 10 
students in the past school year 
alone.
The most popular destina
tion continues to be Western 
Europe.

Its a bird, its a plane  no, its 
a middle-aged woman. Helicop
ter parents, those who hover 
over their childrens lives, take 
parental guidance to the extreme. 
Its a phenomenon specific to our 
generation, fueled by cell phones, 
Facebook accounts, and Baby 
Boomer parents who dont know 
when to stop.
In lower education, helicop
ter parents (HPs) are the ones 
storming into classrooms, hag
gling over workloads and grades. 
But it doesnt end there. Even in 
college, HPs are problematic, 
text-messaging their kids, look
ing them up on Facebook, or 
even making direct calls to the 
administration.
There have been times when 
parents have called asking about 
grades, said William Alba, direc
tor of the Science and Humanities 
Scholars Program. Though partions about QPAs and classes, 
their children could answer just 
as well as he can, he said.
Although Alba might not mind 
the phone calls, someone else 
might, like an employer. HPs of
ten continue hovering even after 
their children have graduated 
college, according to an April 23 
article in USA Today. HPs some
times show up at career fairs, 
talking to company recruiters 
alongside  or instead of  
their children. Additionally, HPs 
call employers for information 
on jobs and internships, often 
calling back after their children 
are hired to discuss salaries and 
benefits.
Such intense parental involve
ment might sound like a nui
sance, but. USA Today reports that 
children of HPs often appreciate 
their parents help when finding 
a job. Employers, however, feel 
differently; they tend to count 
applicants hyperactive parents 
against them.See PARENTS, page A3

One ordinary mid-October 
day, Assistant Vice President of 
Campus Services Tim Michael 
came to work  but it would be 
his last day at Carnegie Mellon 
after five years.
Tim Michael, former director 
of Housing and Dining Services 
and dean of Student Affairs, is 
no longer with Carnegie Mellon 
University.
Michael refused to comment 
when asked about the circum
stances of his leave.
Michaels secretary, Susan 
Aloe, was also unavailable for 
comment.
According to James Mercolini, assistant general counsel, 
Carnegie Mellon policy is that 
when an employee leaves the 
university, the circumstances 
are to remain private.
Kim Abel, the current di
rector of Housing and Dining 
Services, directed questions 
regarding Tim Michael to Mi
chael Murphy, associate vice 
president of enrollment.
Murphy in turn directed 
questions to William Elliott, 
vice president for enrollment. 
Elliott would not comment on 
why Michael is no longer with 
the university, or whether the 
university or Michael termi
nated the relationship.
University Police would not 
comment on Michael, either.
In July 2006, Michael, then 
director of Housing and Din
ing Services, was promoted to 
director of a new campus divi
sion, Campus Services, part 
of Enrollment, headed by El
liott. Michael was in charge of 
Housing and Dining Services; 
Conference & Event, Printing, 
Parking, and Postal Services; 
retail operations, including the 
bookstore, art store, computer 
store, and Entropy; receiving 
and shipping; and Photography
& Graphic Services.
Michael was involved with 
many initiatives during his time 
at Carnegie Mellon, including 
the introduction of the Zipcar service and the expanded 
Entropy-h In 2005, Michael 
was involved in the creation 
of the Kosher Corner eatery on

Helicopter parenting, however 
annoying, can also seriously hin
der a childs (or college students) 
abilities to make decisions or 
solve problems, according to an 
article published March 21, 2006 
in The Washington Post. Even a 
successful academic education 
cannot fully prepare students for 
life after college; certain skills 
can only be learned by doing.
HPs are associated with the 
generation of people born after 
1982, often called the millennial 
generation, the Post reports. Par
ents of the millennial generation 
have access to the Internet and 
cell phones, making it easier than 
ever to keep track of their kids.
Junior math major Jason Tribbett has had both good and bad 
experiences with such technol
ogy. Though some parents are 
still struggling with the concept 
of voicemail, Tribbetts parents 
are mobile-sawy enough to send 
him text messages.
Business professor Chester Spatt discussed current economic issues 
with students in the Undergraduate Finance Association on Wednesday.
Spatt predicts future 
of the U.S. economy
by Matthew E. Campbell
Copy Manager
Chester Spatt, a Tepper School 
of Business professor and, inci
dentally, one of the few people 
to have paid David Tepper $5 an 
hour (when Tepper was his TA), 
returned to Carnegie Mellon 
after a three-year term as chief 
economist of the federal Securi
ties and Exchange Commission. 
At a lecture Wednesday, Spatt 
spoke on systemic risk and the 
economy in a presentation to the 
Undergraduate Finance Associa
tion.
The last several months have 
been chaotic in the stock mar
ket.
The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, one stock market 
indicator, rose to a record 14,000 
points and beyond in July. Fri
day, the Dow closed at 13,176.79. 
Two hedge funds, owned by the 
venerated investment bank Bear 
Stearns, collapsed. According 
to a Bloomberg article, Bear 
Stearns injected $1.6 billion 
into one of the funds, the larg
est hedge fund bailout in nearly 
a decade.
Many universities, Carnegie 
Mellon among them, invest their 
endowments.
Information about Carnegie 
Mellons investing strategies can 
be found at http://www.cmu. 
e d u/gi vi ng/pl a nne d/q_ and_a. 
shtml#5. Eighty percent of the 
endowment is aimed toward 
growth, while 20 percent is in
vested in fixed-income invest
ments. Of the 80 percent, half of 
that is invested in American eq
uities (stocks) and 15 percent is 
invested in international stocks.
Edward Grefenstette, Carn
egie Mellons treasurer and chief 
investment officer who took of
fice in April 2007, said, Not
withstanding the recent market 
turbulence, the endowment has 
also posted positive gains dur
ing the first four months of the 
current fiscal year [beginning in 
July], again showing the benefits 
of a well-diversified portfolio.
According to the universitys 
website, Strong performance in 
some markets often helps to off
set weakness in other markets. 
The limited degree of perfor
mance correlation among mar
kets stabilizes the overall return 
of the endowment.
For the fiscal year that ended 
June 30, Carnegie Mellons in
vestments returned 20.4 per
cent.
The National Association of 
College and University Business 
Officers ranks endowments and 
compares growth rates each 
year, but has not released the 
2007 figures yet. In 2006, Car
negie Mellon had a 12.2-percent 
increase in its endowment, com
pared to 13.5 percent and 18.4 
percent for Harvard and Yale, 
respectively. MIT at number 
six posted one of the largest in
creases at 24.7 percent.
When companies have poor 
profits in a quarter, they often 
tighten their belts and cut their 
sponsorship of the arts and spe
cial projects.
A corporations first obliga
tion is, of course, to their share
holders and their employees,

external relations for the Pitts

Hundreds of students, parents, and teachers gathered outside the Cathedral of Learning on 
Tuesday to protest the proposed closing of 91-year-old Schenley High School next year. Pittsburgh 
Public Schools does not have the $60 million to rid the school of asbestos, said Superintendent 
Mark Roosevelt. If the school does close, 1100 students will be displaced and dispersed among four 
other schools in the area. The school board will vote on the closing in February.

Foreign students increasing in U.S. higher education
FOREIGN, from A1
Several of the senior faculty 
have ties to India or are of In
dian heritage, Krieg said. The 
Indian economy is booming in 
computer science and software 
engineering  those are our ar
eas of excellence. Their economy 
has created a upper class that 
spends $50,000 an year on for
eign education.
The relationship between 
China and Carnegie Mellon goes 
back a long way to when Pitts
burgh was a steel city.
Carnegie Mellons first Ph.D. 
was Dr. Mao, a Chinese engineer, 
who built suspension bridges. 
His statue stands outside Baker 
Hall,' said Indira Nair, vice pro
vost for education.
Korea also has historic ties 
with Carnegie Mellon.
Though a small country, 
Korea is home to many of our 
students, Krieg said. As a na
tion, Koreans believe in getting 
American education. I visited 
Korea and noted that many of the 
senior faculty were educated in 
the United States. These personal 
connections encourage parents 
to send their children here.
International students arrive 
here after taking the TOEFL (Test 
of English as Foreign Language) 
exam and steering through ardu
ous visa requirements.
Thoughinternationalstudents 
are extremely well-prepared, 
they perform an extra cognitive 
function, Nair said. Interna
tional students must struggle to 
translate the nuances and expres
sions of American English into 
basic English, and then even into 
their native language, in order to
understand them, she said.
Academic writing is very dif
ferent from the spoken English. 
People underestimate the im
portance of language fluency 
in understanding the subject 
matter, Nair said.
To facilitate international stu
dents understanding of academic 
English, Nair said, the university 
places all international stu
dents in an introductory English 
course, 76-100, called Reading 
and Writing in a Multicultural 
Setting
A reason that the majority of 
international students wish to 
study science or business has 
to do with the complexities of 
language fluency, American 
English, and cultural adaptation, 
according to Karen Schnakenberg, director of the masters in 
professional writing. Programs
that draw more heavily on these 
skills, such as professional and 
technical writing, draw fewer in
ternational students.
Though acceptance for vari
eties of English is growing, we 
rarely see international students 
in writing programs, Schnakenberg said. Our programs require 
a relatively high level of fluency 
and are challenging enough for 
native English speakers.
Nair feels that the cultural ex
change is mutually beneficial.
International students bring 
their intellectual culture to the 
university. As students face chal
lenges, they learn positive ideas 
from each other, Nair said.
Schnakenberg agrees.
Foreign students bring a fresh 
perspective and awareness of 
other cultures to campus, she 
said.

The Singaporean Food Festival is just one of many cultural events that 
bridge the boundary between international students and the campus 
community.

popularity at universities

for the first time.
Carnegie Mellon students lan
guage choices deviate slightly 
from the national picture.
While nationally, more stu
dents take Spanish than any 
other language by a 40 per
cent margin, the language just 
rounded out the top three at Car
negie Mellon.
At Carnegie Mellon, with 386 
and 276 students apiece, Chi
nese and Japanese are the most 
popular languages, followed by 
Spanish and French at 228 and 
162, respectively. Arabic is not 
offered at the university.
The most popular languages 
studied, such as Chinese and 
Japanese, coincide with the for
eign countries that the greatest 
number of students call home.
According to university data, 
the undergraduate student body 
is 20 percent Asian-American 
and 11 percent international stu
dents, many of whom hail from 
Asia.
I think that having a sizeable 
international population affects 
everyone at the university, said 
Aaron Ong, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering major 
and president of the Singapore 
Students Association. It creates 
a lot more awareness on interna
tional issues, and also educates 
everyone on cultures and lan
guages from around the world.
However, Krieg reminded stu
dents that these statistics are just 
pieces of the pie of the univer
sitys globalization.
She cited international student 
population, study abroad, and 
the language program as just 
a few of the many aspects that 
make our university unique.
For me, when I think of our 
global university, I think first of 
our innovative and entrepreneur
ial faculty, said Krieg.
An estimated 650 foreign re
searchers and faculty come to 
Carnegie Mellon every year both 
to interact with students through 
teaching and to study in individu
alized research fields.
What really fascinates me 
most, she added, is that because 
of our globalization, our school 
is more generally more known 
outside of the U.S. in India, Ko
rea, and the other countries from 
which our international students 
originate.
Ong believes that Carnegie Mel
lon has become truly globalized.
There are so many cultural 
events that are around the school, 
Ong said. We dont just see inter
nationals at these events, and that 
says a lot about our school and its 
international values.
many of our students to go, said 
Lisa Krieg, director of the Office 
of International Education. It is 
often English-speaking, within a 
student comfort zone; and histor
ically popular and well-known.
Although few students choose 
to study in the Middle East 
through external programs, the 
exchange program with the Qa
tar campus has increased the 
number of students studying in 
the area.
Krieg also said that interna
tional students often choose to 
study abroad in countries other 
than their country of origin.
Students are enthusiastic about 
their choice to study abroad.
I cant imagine not going 
anywhere over my four years, 
said Alexa Beaver, a sophomore 
chemical engineering and His
panic studies double major. Its 
just such a great opportunity that 
youll never get at any other time 
in your life.
Beaver plans to study in Spain 
this summer.
According to Open Doors, 
summer study and periods of less 
than eight weeks are the most 
popular type of program nation
ally; at Carnegie Mellon, most 
students opt to go for a semester.
While study abroad has its ap
peal for many, others choose to 
exercise their foreign language 
skills on campus.
An estimated 1347 of roughly 
6000 undergraduates are en
rolled in a foreign language class 
this semester, according to the 
modern languages department.
This percentage is reflective of 
national trends reported by the 
Modern Language Association.
I cant imagine not know
ing another language in todays 
world, said Beaver. I feel like 
we have become so global that 
knowing how to speak in just one 
other way is invaluable.
The number of students 
studying foreign languages has 
increased, particularly for the 10 
most popular languages, accord
ing to the MLA study.
Spanish and French, the two 
most popular, increased by 10 
percent and 2 percent, respec
tively.
However, the biggest changes 
included Asian and Middle East
ern languages.
According to the MLA, the 
number of students studying 
Arabic* Chinese, and Korean in
creased 127 percent, 31 percent, 
and 57 percent, respectively. 
This year, Arabic broke into the 
top 10 most popular languages
For Tribbett, the cell phone 
actually lessens his contact with 
his parents, reducing phone con
versations to text messages.
I actually like it better, he 
said, because if they didnt text 
me theyd leave a message on 
my phone or something.
Still, whether by phone 
call, text message, or e-mail, 
college students today commu
nicate with their parents more 
frequently than those in earlier 
generations, Alba said.
When I was in college, [mak
ing frequent phone calls] was 
completely inconceivable, he 
said. I called my parents once 
or twice a week  after 11 p.m. 
when the rates went down.
But technology isnt always so 
helpful. While exploring Facebook on his brothers account, 
Tribbetts mother found pictures 
ofhim at parties that he hadnt 
intended her to see.
Tribbett knew that his photos 
on Facebook were essentially 
public, so he wasnt surprised 
when his mother found them, 
just embarrassed. I kind of ex
pected that to happen anyway, 
he said.
Technology helps parents 
monitor their children, but the 
Post cites another reason for 
modem HPs: pride in parent
ing. For example, the Baby on 
Board signs for car windows 
started cropping up in the 80s, 
at the start of the millennial gen
eration. According to the Post, 
theres a theory that parents pri
marily use Baby on Board signs 
to brag about their children, not 
to encourage safer driving.
Now, some of those same Baby 
on Board parents are probably 
wearing Carnegie Mellon Mom 
sweatshirts and feeling just as 
proud.
Overall, most argue that HPs 
must strike a balance with their 
children between hyper-involve
ment and no involvement at all.
The key, Alba said, is for 
parents to change along with 
their kids. You dont parent a
1-year-old the way you parent 
a 20-year-old, he said. Albas 
daughter Beatrice is only 1 year 
old, but hes already noticing 
differences in the things she can 
do, some of which require him 
to adjust his parenting.
I think we as human beings 
tend to make silly judgments 
sometimes, and the older we 
get, the better we get at mak
ing decisions for ourselves, he 
said.

Water main breaks at Forbes and Morewood
A water main break took over the intersection of Forbes and Morewood early Thursday afternoon. The 
City of Pittsburgh Water Authority quickly arrived on the scene to isolate the problem. While workmen 
dealt with the incident, University Police helped to redirect traffic. The entrance to the Morewood park
ing lot was closed and buildings on Forbes were advised of possible water outages. While some restroom 
facilities in campus buildings experienced brown water, no outages were reported and the break was fixed 
by the evening.

Credit and hedge fund troubles hurting economy, Spatt says
SPATT, from Al
times, corporations are inclined to share 
their good fortune with the community 
through increased support of commu
nity organizations; conversely, in chal
lenging economic times, we should be 
sensitive to any belt-tightening in the 
corporate world and adjust our expec
tations accordingly.
In his lecture, Spatt spoke about sys
temic risk and how hedge funds  and 
banks  got themselves into trouble 
and triggered the summer credit 
crunch.
Spatt said that markets currently 
are illiquid, meaning lots of banks 
and investors have lots of money in as
sets that have lost value and that they 
cannot sell without losing a bundle. 
In fact, illiquid markets became even 
more illiquid as banks sold off the as
sets that were easy to sell rather than
V M
the assets that were difficult to sell.
The effect of the illiquid market was 
that credit dried up over the summer 
and loans were difficult to get, even for 
people with good (prime) credit.
Many of these assets that lost value 
are subprime and variable-rate (in 
which the rate starts out low and then 
jumps later) mortgages. Millions of 
Americans with poor credit received 
mortgages from companies like Wash
ington Mutual and Countrywide 
Financial.
From what Ive heard, its basically 
like a very slow downfall thats occur
ring, said senior business administra
tion major Jyoti Joshi. Even though 
this thing started a few months ago, 
people are just beginning to default on 
their mortgages now, and many more 
will default in the next few months. 
The credit ratings of these people 
and many companies non-discriminai I
tory lending practices failed to reflect 
the riskiness of these mortgages.
While painful, some of the mis
pricing in the credit markets had to be 
corrected at some point, which means 
that, going forward, there should be 
more logical pricing of risk, Grefenstette said.
Grefenstettes remarks echo those 
of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who told Congress Nov. 8, To 
be sure, the recent developments may 
well lead to a healthier financial sys
tem in the medium to long term.
Those who predicted Americans 
wouldnt be able to pay their mort
gages, though, prospered.
According to Forbes magazine, 
Money manager John Paulson joins 
the list [of American billionaires] after 
pocketing more than $1 billion shortselling subprime credit this summer. 
Also, the falling value of homes has
hurt Americans and companies alike.
New Yorks attorney general is go
ing after firms that appraised homes 
above their actual value at the urging 
of Washington Mutual.
Many hedge funds and banks ate up 
the subprime credit, a risky move.
Spatt said that those who actually 
bear this risk are obscured by hedge 
funds. Banks use portions of custom
ers deposits to give loans to individuals 
and businesses. Hedge funds were 
known to make the big money (billions 
of dollars) but take larger risks.
However, many banks funded hedge 
funds, and so when hedge funds 
gambled and lost, so did banks like 
Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Mor
gan Chase. Channeling transactions 
to hedge funds reduces transparency of 
risk bearing, Spatt said.
The credit troubles have spilled into 
the general economy.
While it was widely believed during 
the summer that this credit crisis might 
be relatively contained, it has, in fact, 
spilled over into other markets, both 
in the U.S. and abroad, Grefenstette 
said.
Bernanke predicted that the economy 
will slow due to the credit problems, 
among other reasons.
Overall, the committee expected 
that the growth of economic activity 
would slow noticeably in the fourth 
quarter from its third-quarter rate, he 
said. Growth was seen as remaining 
sluggish during the first part of next 
year, then strengthening as the effects 
of tighter credit and the housing cor
rection began to wane.
Many investors clamor for more 
Federal Reserve cuts, but Spatt thinks 
that downside protection encourages 
risky behavior.

A satellite, by definition, is 
any object that orbits another 
object in space.
When one thinks of a satel
lite, the picture that comes most 
readily to mind is that of a manmade satellite  a contraption 
of steel and electronic devices 
with large, signature solar foils 
extending from each side.
In fact, the average human 
being interacts with a dozen 
different satellites everyday.
From Internet and television 
to cell phones and Global Posi
tioning System (GPS) trackers, 
many devices rely on satellites 
to operate.
Satellites are a relatively 
recent invention. The first 
man-made satellite, Sputnik, 
was launched by the Soviet 
Union 50 years ago, an event 
that marked the beginning of 
the space race between the 
United States and the Soviet 
Union.
Today, there are over 560 
known operational satellites in 
orbit. These satellites perform 
various functions, including 
weather surveillance, navi
gation, communication, and 
environmental monitoring.
These satellites do not in
clude military satellites, which 
are mostly classified for na
tional security purposes.
Satellites are usually special
ized, meaning that different 
satellites are equipped to per
form different functions.
Imaging satellites, for in
stance, are equipped with 
cameras and other imaging 
tools, such as infrared scanners 
or radar. These satellites relay 
images of Earth and space back 
to Earth.
Imaging satellites are used 
for a variety of functions, in
cluding astronomy, mapping,
L----------------------------------------------------
Earth at all times. This type 
of orbit is commonly used for 
communications satellites.
Launching a satellite into or
bit requires careful calculation 
of the satellites velocity.
The required minimum 
speed for a stable orbit is above
17,000 miles per hour, but the 
maximum velocity that an 
object can travel without escap
ing Earths gravitational pull is 
around 23,500 mph. This is 
called Earths escape veloc
ity.
If the satellites velocity 
climbs above Earths escape 
velocity, the satellite leaves 
Earths orbit altogether and 
flies off into outer space. But if 
the satellites velocity falls be
low the stable orbit velocity, the 
satellite reenters Earths atmo
sphere and burns up.
Hence, the satellite must 
travel at a velocity that is 
greater than the stable orbit 
velocity but less than Earths 
escape velocity.
During launch, the satellite 
piggybacks on a launch ve
hicle, such as a space shuttle.
The launch vehicle ascends 
to the desired height and en
ters orbit around Earth. Once 
the launch vehicle enters orbit, 
the satellite is gently released 
into space, and its thrusters 
are fired to detach it from the 
launch vehicle.
To maintain a geosynchro
nous orbit, a satellite must be 
released roughly at the height 
of 22,000 miles.
On Feb. 3, 2006, astronauts 
in the International Space Sta
tion launched a spacesuit with 
a radio inside into orbit around 
Earth. The satellite was named 
SuitSat, and it was part of an 
experiment to measure the 
conditions experienced by a 
human-sized body in orbit.
The space suit orbited for 
over 7 months before reenter
ing Earths atmosphere.

Hemoglobin to 
come from cows
Researchers from the Texas 
Tech University Health Sciences 
Center and HemoBioTech, Inc:, 
have come up with a hemoglo
bin product, HemoBioTech, 
to make blood substitutes in 
humans.
Hemoglobin is a protein 
produced by red blood cells. 
It delivers oxygen to the body 
from the lungs.
HemoBioTech comes from 
antelope, bison, and cattle. 
Unlike blood cells in humans, 
this product is free of HIV and 
hepatitis, although patients run 
the risk of contracting mad cow 
disease.
HemoBioTech may serve as 
an alternative to current stocks 
of donated blood. Researchers 
plan on performing clinical tri

Star explodes 
multiple times
When a star explodes, sci
entists call it a supernova, and 
recent research suggests that 
a single star may be capable of 
creating multiple supernovas.
In 2006, scientists found a 
supernova called SN 2006gy 
that appeared much brighter 
than a usual supernova. To ex
plain this finding, astrophysics 
professor Stan Woosley of the 
University of California, Santa 
Cruz and his colleagues claim 
that the star may have exploded 
multiple times.
According to this theory, the 
stars second explosion created 
a shell around the star that 
collided with another shell, 
causing a very bright explosion.
Woosley believes that, to have 
exploded multiple times, the 
star must have been betweein 
90 and 130 times as massive as 
the Sun. The stars temperatu^ 
becomes so high that its co$ 
decreases in size and collapse|. 
The star then expands and 
explodes. +

BODIES...The Exhibition
Carnegie Science Center presents a 
life-like view of the human bodys insides

Junior Staffwriter
BODIES...The Exhibition brings 
to life, with special attention to 
detail, the inner workings of the 
human body through an innova
tive preservation process called 
plastination.
The exhibit is organized 
into a handful of sections that 
provide a closer look at the 
skeletal, muscular, respiratory, 
and reproductive systems of the 
body.
The exhibit features exqui
sitely dissected human specimens 
and real organs. The bodies are 
delicately preserved so that the 
viewer can see each nerve, blood 
vessel, and bone.
According to the Carnegie Sci
ence Centers webpage for the 
exhibit, the process of plastina
tion was first invented by Dr. 
Gunther Von Hagens in 1977. 
This process involves four main 
steps.
In the first step, the tissues of 
the body are chemically fixed 
with formaldehyde to stop the 
decomposition process. This pre
servative works by irreversibly 
cross-linking proteins or DNA.
The body is then dissected and 
submerged in a bath of liquid ac
etone, which maintains freezing 
temperatures so that the acetone 
can replace the water in each 
cell.
Next, the specimen is placed 
in a liquid silicone bath under 
vacuum pressure. This process 
allows the acetone to flow out of 
the tissue, creating a volume defi
cit of liquid in the body.
A plastic polymer can then 
permeate the cells as the acetone 
vaporizes and leaves the cells. 
The plastic is cured in gas, heat, 
or UV light to harden it.
In the exhibits display of the 
circulatory system, a technique 
known as corrosion casting is
used to prepare each specimen. 
In this process, blood vessels 
are first injected with a colored 
polymer. Upon hardening, the re
maining body tissue is chemically 
removed, leaving the complete 
circulatory system intact.
In the same way, the bodys 
complete nervous system is laid 
out upon a surface by itself.
In addition to lifelike dis
plays of body parts, BODIES... 
The Exhibition creates a rich 
learning environment acces
sible to visitors of all ages. 
Each dissected piece or body 
is well-labeled and most often 
accompanied by commentary 
on its function or problems that 
could give rise to health risks.
In addition, many of the walls 
are lined with trivia. The human 
body, for instance, contains over
60,000 miles of blood vessels.
Nicole Kinsel is a staff member 
at the Carnegie Science Center 
who works at the hands-on table 
at the end of the exhibit.
Kinsel allowed visitors to hold 
and examine several organs that 
had been preserved using the 
plastination process. The organs 
on display had a unique texture 
similar to that of a waxy, hard 
rubber.
This brain is very close to the 
actual weight  the silicon poly
mer simply replaces the mass of 
the natural fluids, Kinsel said. 
This exhibit is amazing because 
things that you see in two dimen
sions  in textbooks  can now 
be seen in 3-D!
Halfway through the exhibit, 
visitors are able to make a detour 
through a room that displays the 
stages of fetal development.
This area showcases develop
ment of a human body from the 
embryo stage up to the birth of a 
child.
To make the process of skeletal 
growth visible, bone-binding dye 
was injected into specimens of 
the fetuses. This unique method 
has been implemented in sci
entific research to aid in the
visualization of bone growth.
The dye illuminates the bones 
of the fingers and toes in a fetus 
as early as three months after 
conception.
According to the Carnegie Sci
ence Center, over 30,000 visitors 
have experienced BODIES..The 
Exhibit in Pittsburgh over the 
past month.
Throughout the exhibit, visi
tors are encouraged to make 
healthy lifestyle choices. The ex
hibit even provides a tall, clear 
plastic bin, in which viewers can 
deposit their packs of cigarettes 
after viewing a set of a smokers 
tarred lungs.
In addition, the exhibit includes 
information on modern medicine 
and various diseases, including 
Parkinsons and Alzheimers. It 
also educates visitors on ways to 
prevent disease.
In a Carnegie Science Cen
ter press release, Ron Baillie, 
chief program officer at Car
negie Science Center, stated, 
This exhibition is a tremendous 
opportunity to educate the public 
abouthealthy lifestyles and living, 
and we wanted to take advantage 
of our expertise in educational 
programming to offer more to 
Pittsburgh residents than what 
may have been available at other 
BODIES exhibitions.
Baillie said, We want to com
bine what visitors learn in the 
exhibition with real-life experi
ence to help them make lifestyle 
changes to improve their own 
health.
The Carnegie Science Center 
is also offering lectures on mod
ern medicine as well as health 
screenings on select Saturdays, 
the next of which is Jan. 12.
BODIES...The Exhibit was 
unveiled Oct. 8 at the Carnegie 
Science Centers UPMC SportsWorks building. It will be on dis
play through May 4, 2008.

Be careful what you post on Facebook
failed to even reasonably cover his tracks, 
we cant .completely condemn him for 
his fib. Colvin was not the first persdn to 
make up a false excuse to skip work for a 
day, and he probably wont be the last.
There are entire books, like Ellie Bish
ops The Sick Day Handbook: Strategies 
and Techniques for Faking It, that have 
been devoted to the task of calling off 
work on those days when it seems im
possible to get out of bed.
Regardless of the severity of his crime, 
Colvins experience is evidence that 
social networks such as Facebook arent 
always harmless fun when users post 
too much information about themselves. 
Social networking sites are no longer ac
tivities for young people. Bosses have
quickly gained the know-how to track 
their employees on such networks.
The moral to this story: Be careful 
what you share. And do not think that 
simply because your profile is restricted, 
your boss cannot gain access to any 
embarrassing photos or groups you 
may belong to. Valleywag.com recently 
reported how one company asked 
Facebook to access an employees re
stricted profile. Facebook is rumored 
to have obliged, sharing the employees 
photos and information with the company.
People should be cautious when call
ing off sick for work. Long gone are 
the days when all a hooky player had 
to worry about was running into a 
coworker.
When Kevin Colvih, an intern at Irish 
Anglo Bank, called off work before Hal
loween, saying something came up, 
he probably wasnt expecting his boss to 
monitor his actual activities on Facebook.
But Colvins boss did, in fact, check 
Colvins Facebook profile. He found pho
tos of him at a Halloween party at the 
same time Colvin was supposed to be 
tending to his unknown issue. The photo 
showed Colvin dressed as a fairy, hold
ing a magic wand in one hand and a can 
of chilled beer in the other. According 
to valleywag.com, the boss responded 
in an e-mail, Hope everything is ok... 
(cool wand), and BCCd the rest of the 
office, attaching the photo of Colvin.
While Colvin did lie to his boss aridMainstream musicians dont 
profit from making musicNew bill forces universities to police students
Thursday was a big day for the RIAA. 
After sending out a new batch of 417 outof-court settlement letters to students at 
16 universities, the House of Represen
tatives education committee passed a 
bill requiring universities to offer legal 
alternatives to piracy, such as pay ser
vices, for its students. The bill urges uni
versities to consider technology-based 
deterrents to block potential peer-topeer transactions, effectively forcing 
universities to police their students 
downloading habits. As an incentive for 
universities, the bill threatens to pull out 
all students federal financial aid  even 
if not all students download illegally  
for universities that dont comply.
This is not the way to curb illegal 
downloading. Universities have long 
been aware that their students illegally 
pirate movies and music, and the RIAA
has long been slamming students with 
settlement notices. This bill puts univer
sities in an even more precarious position 
as the middleman who can do no right 
 it asks them to monitor and covertly 
prevent their students from download
ing illegally, or face the RIAA.
Even so, the RIAA is already forcing 
universities to turn on its students by 
sending the settlement letters to the uni
versities and entrusting them to deliver 
the letters to the offending students.
The bill puts universities betweenia 
rock and a hard place. If universities do 
too much, theyre punishing students 
they should be helping; if they dont do 
enough, its students who lose federal 
funding, not the universities themselves. 
This also creates an economic dispar
ity in that the lowest income students 
who receive the most federal aid will be
hardest hit if the government decides to 
come down on a university.
Moreover, statistics show that uni
versities are responsible for only a small 
fraction of illegal downloads, and copy
right infringement cases at universities 
have drastically decreased since schools 
became aware of the problem. The RIAA 
should crack down on other demograph
ics, not just college students.
Butmost importantly, howuniversities 
handle students who illegally download 
should be between the schools admin
istrations and their students. Instead, 
the bill forces universities to be the 
bad guy and crack down on their own 
students, as well as leave students vul
nerable to having their education com
promised by the federal government. 
Universities are here to educate us, not 
police us.
Requiring study abroad leads to
If you already thought the pressure 
of stacking your resume with awards, 
internships, and a sweet GPA was over
whelming, then brace yourself. Theres 
yet another qualification employers will 
want to see: experience studying abroad.
According to a study conducted at 
Penn State University, University of 
Notre Dame, University of Kentucky, 
and Pacific Lutheran University last 
year, employers rated study abroad as 
the third most valuable experience a 
potential employee can have. The only 
things employers rated more highly 
than study abroad were having the de
sired major, and having a major or minor 
in a foreign language.
In a time when you cant help hear
ing the world globalization at least 10
times a day, employers cite the ability of 
job candidates to adapt to and interact 
with foreign cultures as an increasingly 
necessary skill set.
While that may be true, employers 
must realize that not all students can af
ford to study abroad. In addition to the 
often staggering cost of study abroad pro
grams (New York University estimates 
the cost of tuition and lodging for its se
mester in Paris to be about $21,000), U.S. 
News & World Report says that the weak 
American dollar also makes studying in 
popular destinations in western Europe 
unaffordable for some students.
To get a good job, students already 
need to get a college degree. Placing a 
high value on yet another experience 
that only some people can afford might
further increase the inequalities sur
rounding the cost of higher education.
Additionally, study abroad experience 
might not really be indicative of a stu
dents ability to adapt and interact. The 
Institute for International Educations 
latest annual survey found that; more 
than half of all study abroad is com
pleted in short-term programs that last 
less than a semester. Short-term study 
abroad hardly provides the cultural im
mersion that employers seem to be seeking.
Students are already under a great 
deal of pressure to have internship and 
work experience before getting their 
first jobs out of college  its unfair for 
employers to add a new qualification, 
especially one that furthers the eco
nomic divide.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 19, 2007
College tours should focus on unique aspects of school
Sarah Mogin
As the product of a collegehappy suburban town, Ive been 
on an embarrassing number of 
college tours, enough to make 
me an expert. And if there is one 
thing I noticed throughout my 
travels, from Boston College to 
Oberlin, from cable-knit-wearing 
preps to barefoot bohemians, 
its this: All college tours are the 
same.
The reason, perhaps, is that 
college tours are what they sound 
like: tours of college. Not just 
Boston College, not just Oberlin, 
but college  any college. College 
tours are more like guides to the 
college experience, the freedom, 
the flexibility, and  sometimes
 the stupidity.
To this end, college tours 
are almost always filled with 
FAT  facilities, activities, and 
traditions.
Concerning facilities, some 
tidbits are more valuable than 
others. At Carnegie Mellon, for 
example, prospective students 
might want to know that we have 
a 9000-square-foot space for art 
(Regina Gouger Miller Gallery), 
a 97-99 percent particle- and
dust-free room (the basement of 
Hamerschlag Hall), and a twoto-one student-to-computer ratio 
(over 20 clusters).
The above information is all 
in our tour, but so is a lot of 
other stuff, most of which has 
little to do with Carnegie Mellon. 
The same goes for pretty much 
any school; college tours rarely 
restrict themselves to school-spe
cific facts.
We have a library! the 
tour guide will say, rattling off 
numbers of volumes, collections, 
and books that go in and out 
prospective students ears. The 
guide will continue, explain
ing how students at college X 
can even borrow books from 
the nearby college Y. This is not 
something to be proud of  this 
is standard.
Aside from libraries, tour guides 
are known to dwell on other such 
run-of-the-mill facilities, includ
ing swimming pools, gym equip
ment, and shuttle services.
College tours also emphasize 
campus activities  student 
organizations and sports  even 
though most of these are stan
dard at any school.
Any student can start a club, 
the guide will say. All they need 
are four friends and an advisor. 
We even have a Simpsonswatching club!
Instead of focusing on the 
activities truly unique to their 
schools, tour guides choose ones 
that most embody the college 
experience: the zany Simpsonswatching club, the fun-loving 
Ultimate Frisbee team, and 
the diversity-filled cultural 
organizations.
There are several clubs and 
activities on campus unique to 
Carnegie Mellon, including 
Sweepstakes (i.e., Buggy), the 
Kiltie Band, and the Society for 
Creative Anachronism. But these 
are hy far outnumbered by the 
clubs that only seem unique, like 
the juggling club, which probably 
exists at dozens of other schools.
Unfortunately, when it comes to 
tours, guides mention at least one 
juggling club for every Society for 
Creative Anachronism.
Finally, college tour guides 
love to talk about traditions 
and legends, perhaps the tours 
most frivolous endeavor. Every 
school has its folklore  some 
of it interesting and some of it 
not  and college tours do not 
discriminate.
Legend has it that anyone who 
steps on this part of the sidewalk 
will fail their exams, the tour 
guide will say.
Is this true? Do students 
actually avoid that spot on a daily 
basis? Or, did the tour guide just
pick a random square of side
walk? We dont know.
Carnegie Mellon has a couple 
of interesting traditions, primar
ily the Fence and our celebration 
of our Scottish heritage. Our tour 
guides do mention these, but not 
without some other less pertinent 
anecdotes.
Perhaps the most striking 
example is the legend about the 
sloped floors in Baker Hall  
that Andrew Carnegie requested 
them so that, if his trade school 
didnt catch on, he could turn 
the building into a factory with a 
gravity-assisted assembly line.
First of all, this legend is 100 
percent false; campus architect 
Henry Hornbostel created the 
sloping halls to deal with our 
locations hilly terrain.
On top of that, the sloped 
floor legend is not even worth 
upholding, since it paints our 
founder in a less-than-flattering 
light. If it were true, it would 
mean that Mr. My-Heart-Is-InThe-Works heart was actually 
somewhere else  probably 
closer to the steel plant.
The point is, if we cant trust 
campus traditions or legends 
to be true, theyre not worth 
mentioning.
With all that in mind, it is clear 
that FAT-filled tours are annoying, 
but theyre also frustrating, since
college tours  in theory  are 
a necessary part of the school 
selection process.
Prospective college students 
benefit from actually seeing the 
campuses of their top-choice 
Schools. Aspects of campus 
architecture, from buildings 
to landscaping, can make or 
break a college experience; 
for example, MITs infinite 
corridor, an 825-foot hallway 
that looks like the inside of a 
giant high school, has likely 
deterred many a prospective 
applicant.
Its also helpful for interest
ed students to go through the 
process of traveling to their topchoice colleges, to see if theyre 
far from home, isolated from 
local shopping, or adjacent to 
creepy motels channeling the 
Bates.
All of this is important  
Baker Halls sloped floors, how
ever, are not. For students just 
interested in learning about the 
universal allure of college, rath
er than the unique aspects of a 
given school, a campus tour isnt 
necessary  just watch Animal 
House.

The Scottie mascot does not intimidate, does warm hearts
~s
Alex Ewing
When I mentioned to a friend 
that my high school mascot was 
the Pioneer, she echoed the 
recent complaints of many, reply
ing, Wow. So this is your second 
lame mascot in a row?
While I agree the new Tartan 
mascot, the Scottie dog, is less 
than intimidating, I held my 
tongue: Is it wrong to think our 
new mascot is just a little bit 
adorable?
In high school, the Pioneer 
wasnt the strongest mascot. At 
football games, its hard to cheer 
it on as it dances on the sidelines. 
But the Pioneer, despite its inabil
ity to really pack a school-spirited 
punch, is an image to be feared  
who else braves the assumption 
of unknown diseases picked up 
from bad nutrition while travers
ing an unknown country? What 
if the Pioneer were a cannibal, 
maybe an unknown survivor of 
the Donner Party? Im afraid 
of such an image, and I think 
most would be. No one wants 
dysentery; no one wants to meet 
a Pioneer in a dark alley. The 
Pioneer could likely kill you in 
more ways than youd expect.
But its harder to make a story 
out of the Scottie, as I cannot 
pretend to fear fleas, intestinal 
worms, or use of the pooper 
scooper as much as I tremble at 
the thought of an escaped can
nibal or an unflinchingly valiant 
explorer.
The Scottie doesnt strike fear 
into the hearts of our athletic 
enemies. It isnt going to convince 
any competitors that our teams 
are a force with which to be reck
oned. The volleyball team was 
just crowned Eastern College 
Athletic College (ECAC) South
champions, and both of our soc
cer teams made it to the ECAC 
quarterfinals. Our football teams 
performance during regular sea
son earned a bowl game (and 
win) this past weekend. The 
Tartans, in every sport, are a 
threat. The Scottie isnt necessary 
to provoke fear in our adversaries 
because the quality of athletics 
do that.
Moreover, do we even have 
athletic enemies? Is this a pur
pose the Scottie should even 
serve? I wont lie: I didnt come to
Carnegie Mellon for its outstand
ing volleyball team; I dont care 
about sports. I could only cite the 
aforementioned statistics after 
spending a lot of time on Google 
verifying every word.
There is a fair argument to be 
made that the Scottie will, in 
part, unite our scattered alumni, 
which might bring them closer to 
Carnegie Mellon and encourage 
them to give back to the uni
versity, further increasing our 
endowment, which is small for a 
school of our size and standing.
But in all honesty, the Scottie 
doesnt do much of anything.
But despite all this, has anyone 
looked at the thing? Its ador
able. With its little plaid scarf, its 
the definition of heart-warming. 
How could we not love it? With 
this unnamed mascot, weve 
entered the dog hall of fame. The 
Scottie looks more adorable than 
its other, more famous dog coun
terparts, like Lassie or Toto or 
Eddie from Frasier. In terms of 
QPA (QT-Pie Adorability), weve 
achieved a perfect 4.0. The only
way our Scottie could get more 
adorable would be if we were 
to slap a monocle on the terrier 
and pretend its an aristocrat-.
This, I know, will never hap
pen. But what if he did assume 
a name wholly punning the 
Carnegie Mellon spirit?
Soon enough, sitting in the 
black chairs in the UC, you will 
look over at the video screens by 
the Information Desk and some 
prospective student will have 
selected a short video about our 
sports teams. The screen will 
fade into a shot of the football 
field, and sniffing around on 
the ground will be an animated 
Scottish terrier. You will con
tinue looking over the top of 
your laptop and see the large 
letters Meet Heart! pop up on 
the screen. Here at Carnegie 
Mellon, the screen will read as 
an image appears of the terrier 
prancing across a photograph 
of a quarterback ready to throw 
the football, Heart is always in 
the work. You and the prospec
tive student will let out simul
taneous groans, and your eyes 
will drift back to your paper 
while the prospect will consider 
looking at a less-corny school.
Maybe we dont need to strike 
fear into the hearts of NYU or 
Washington & Lee, or any other 
school against which Carnegie 
Mellon competes. The Scottie 
doesnt inspire a fanatical fervor 
the way a wolf or bear would, 
but we dont need that over-thetop reaction anyway. Its cute, 
and Ill argue that Machiavelli 
was wrong, because in the case 
of our mascot, its much better 
to be loved than feared. Or rath
er, its better to provoke awws 
than screaming cheers.

Presidential
Perspectives
Student voices 
ignored, input 
needed
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hey Tartans. First of all, Happy 
Thanksgiving!
While everything is rolling 
smoothly in areas like elections 
reform, institutional memory, 
and everything else Ive spent 
the past several months writing 
about, today I spend my Presi
dential Perspectives discussing a 
significant disconnect that exists 
on our campus. That disconnect 
is between the students and our 
faculty.
I had the fortune of attending 
this months Faculty Senate meet
ing, where part of the discussion 
revolved around creating a 
shadow grade system that would 
not reflect itself in our actual 
marks but would give the faculty 
a better picture of whether or not 
instituting a +/- grading system 
(e.g. A-, A, A+ grading vs. A, B, 
C) would be appropriate. Profes
sors would be asked to submit 
all students grade equivalents 
in a +/- format in addition to the 
grade earned under the current 
system. In my opinion, monitor
ing is not at all a problem, and in 
fact, the Faculty Senate was will
ing enough to extend visibility 
of this shadow program to the 
students as well. However, when 
discussing how this policy would 
theoretically be put into effect, it 
seemed as though the room was 
divided between professors who 
had student opinions at heart 
and those who seemed to favor 
a maverick style of policy change 
or strong-arming in which stu
dent opinion would not matter.
This fractional opinion did not 
sit well with me considering that 
it is the students grades and the 
students futures that are on the 
line, not the faculty members. 
Granted that the point of a sys
tem change would be to boost 
overall QPA, the fact remains 
that an opinion exists among our 
faculty that students should not 
be consulted when making these 
kinds of decisions. This notion is 
despite the fact that in multiple 
surveys conducted by Student 
Senate, random samples of stu
dents have put down any notion 
of wanting a +/- system.
The fact that the possibility to 
strong-arm exists is a critical is
sue that affects every student. 
Issues like this are the kind of 
things that a strong student gov
ernment created from strong stu
dent participation can deal with. 
While you may not see much 
more than funding opportunities 
in Senate, GSA, or my own office, 
we who participate know there is 
more. This campus can be a bet
ter place if we all try and make 
it so. We can make CMU a place 
where there isnt even a simple 
conjecture about not consulting 
students on issues of import. We 
can take control of our futures. 
All we need is participation.
As always, cmu5@cmu.edu.
Get ready for turkey, yams, and cranberries: Thanksgiving is this Thursday. So we asked,
What are you not thankful for?

after something like that. It 
may have been an intentional 
foul, but it wasnt anything 
malicious.
Despite the ejection, Einwag 
still led the team in scoring 
with 18 points. Senior co-captain Geoff Kozak chipped in 
13 points, and sophomore Jack 
Anderson contributed 14 for the 
Tartans.
Saturday night against New 
York the team had better for
tune. They struggled from the 
field again, but upped their free 
throw percentage and got solid 
contributions from Einwag, 
who led the team again with 25 
points.
Kozak had an efficient night, 
converting 50 percent of his 
shots and both of his free throw 
attempts. He also chipped in 
four assists and a steal.
I just made a conscious ef
fort to take open shots and 
better shots than I had [on Fri
day], Kozak said. We try to 
understand that the season is a 
marathon and not a sprint. Greg 
[Gonzalez] and I talked, and we 
refused to be demoralized after 
one game.
Gonzalez contributed a dou
ble-double in the second game 
of his final season' at Carnegie 
Mellon. His five blocks in two 
games moved him into third 
place on the schools all-time 
block list.
It was particularly important 
after a mediocre performance 
the night before, which had 
been Gonzalezs first game back 
from an injury-related redshirt 
year last season.
I hadnt played an entire 
year and I went out there 
against Johns Hopkins a little 
too anxious, Gonzalez said. 
I came out on Saturday and 
tried to concentrate on the little 
things. I just tried to have fun 
out there.
Despite another night of poor 
shooting, the Tartans knocked 
down shots when it mattered. 
They took control of the game 
in the second half, after trail
ing by two at halftime, behind 
three straight three-pointers by 
sophomore Deacon Lavallee.
Lavallees three-point shoot
ing propelled the Tartans to 
their first lead of the second 
half. They didnt look back from 
there. A pair of free throws 
from Einwag with six minutes 
left pushed the lead to 10 and 
made it curtains for the Yellow 
Jackets.

This team has a lot of poise, 
the players are very confident, 
and they are really starting to 
get together both offensively and 
defensively to help each other 
out on the floor, said head coach 
Gerri Seidl. To win two games 
against two tough teams is a 
great beginning.... It gives us a 
good indication that we can com

WOMENS, from A10
Although they were outrebounded 37-50, Carnegie 
Mellon shot 40.9 percent from 
the field compared to Otterbeins 
40 percent.
Saturday, Aleski and Schilling 
were once again the main scor
ing options for the Tartans, with 
17 and 13 points, respectively. 
With their outstanding perfor
mances on both days, Aleski was 
named the Most Valuable Player 
of the UAA/OAC Challenge, with
and Schilling, who accounted for 
seven of those 10 points.
Mount Union tried to hang 
tough, but back-to-back threepointers by Aleski and a jump 
shot by Schilling at the start of 
the second half gave the Tartans 
their biggest lead of the game, at 
37-26.
Mount Union mounted a 
comeback, with forward Alicia 
Williams layup closing things up 
at 46-44 with just 2:04 remain
ing. However, Aleski responded 
with her fourth three-pointer of 
the half and Schilling sank two
free throws to seal the victory.
When asked about her great 
performance, Aleski gave all 
credit to her teammates. My 
performance was all thanks to 
my teammates; I dont think I hit 
a single shot that did not come 
from a pass, Aleski said.
The camaraderie among the 
players was obvious, with the 
team totaling 16 assists in each 
of the two games. Everyone 
is friends on the team and we 
spend a lot of time with each 
other, Aleski said. There are no 
cliques and were really starting

Crites said. They played their

Thats the biggest thing: They 
didnt quit. It was a good game.
Coming into the game we 
knew that we would have to run 
the ball, and it didnt work out as 
well as we hoped for, so we had 
to air it out a little bit, Pantalone 
said. The receivers made some 
great catches and we picked up 
blocking from the line. Especially 
in the second half, things were 
clicking. When we had the ball 
we did well with it, and then our 
defense in the second half just 
stepped up and shut them down. 
It was a complete team effort 
today.

Aio THE TARTAN November 19, 3007
Mens basketball wins 
one at Johns Hopkins
by Casey Taylor
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team returned home 
from Baltimore with mixed 
emotions, after splitting their 
games at the 17th Annual Blue 
Jay Invitational hosted by Johns 
Hopkins University.
The Tartans had an abysmal 
shooting effort in both games, 
losing to Johns Hopkins Friday, 
and pulling out a victory Sat
urday against New York City 
College of Technology.
The team hit their fair share of 
road bumps Friday night against 
Johns Hopkins. Junior forward 
Ryan Einwag got things started 
for the Tartans with a jump shot 
22 seconds into the game to give 
them a 2-0 lead.
Unfortunately, it was the first 
and last time they would have 
the lead for the rest of the game. 
Johns Hopkins led by as many as
17 points in the first half, includ
ing a 19-3 run that began after 
Einwags initial score.
Assistant coach Kevin Byrne 
hinted that the game may have 
been doomed from the start. 
Some of our former players 
were at the game and they men
tioned that our team has never

Saturday, the mens cross
country team competed in the 
NCAA Division III Cross-Coun
try Championships at St. Olaf 
College in Minnesota. The mens 
team surpassed expectations 
and placed ninth out of 32 teams 
with 372 points, improving on 
last years 12th place finish.
Only the top 32 teams in Di
vision III competed in the final 
race of the season. New York 
University, a member of Carne
gie Mellons conference, finished 
first with 128 points.
> In the 8K race, junior Brian 
Harvey led the team and finished 
12th overall with a time of24:57. 
Prior to the championships, Har
vey was named NCAA Division 
III Mideast Regional Athlete of 
the Year after an incredible firstplace finish at regionals.
Fifth-year Geoff Misek ended 
his collegiate career by placing 
91st with a time of 25:47. Sopho
more Dario Donatelli and junior
shot well at [the] Johns Hopkins 
gym, Byrne said.
The premonition came true on 
Friday night. The Tartans shot 
miserably, hitting only 36 per
cent of their shots, including 19 
percent from three-point terri
tory, and 55 percent of their free 
throws.
Johns Hopkins didnt fare 
much better from the field, only 
connecting on 40 percent of 
their shots, but they bested the 
Tartans from the charity stripe, 
knocking down 80 percent of 
their attempts.
Carnegie Mellon fought back 
in the second half, coming as 
close as four points with 1:14 
left to play, but they failed to get 
over the hump.
The Tartans gave up a layup 
and then Johns Hopkins knocked 
down two free throws to push 
their lead to eight and seal the 
game.
As if poor shooting wasnt 
enough, the Tartans suffered a 
huge setback in the second half 
when Einwag was ejected after 
an intentional foul.

for a long time, junior forward 
Terrance Bouldin-Johnson said.

Breck Fresen took 108th and 
129th overall with times of 25:52 
and 25:57, respectively. Junior 
Ryan Anderson finished 163rd 
overall with a time of 26:09.
We had some trouble getting 
out in a position we would have 
liked due to the narrow course 
and the crowded start, but we 
still managed to do well, An
derson said.
First-year J.P. Allera finished 
his rookie season by placing 
203rd overall with a time of 
26:23. Junior Mike Condon also 
finished strong by taking 212th 
overall with a time of 26:29.
We ran our tails off, Do
natelli said. I look forward to 
going into battle with this team 
anytime, anyplace, anywhere. 
We met our expectations, 
finishing so far ahead of our 
ranking, Anderson said. Over
all, we managed to build a very 
cohesive team this season, and 
will be able to use yesterdays 
race as a stepping stone for next 
season. Misek is the only mem
ber of the Tartans top seven who 
wont be returning next year.
Football wins ECAC Southwest Bowl Game
the Week on Oct. 30 for her 
intercollegiate debut with three 
event wins, two NCAA qualify
ing times, and a school record. 
She set the school record for the 
200-yard backstroke with a time 
of 2:05.71, breaking the previ
ous record by more than seven 
seconds.
Saturday, Evans improved 
her times in the 100-yard back
stroke (58.55) and 200-yard IM 
(2:11.22), setting new school 
records. She also won the 200- 
yard backstroke (2:06.40).
Tartan: When did you first 
get involved in swimming?
Evans: I was 5 years old 
when I started swimming 
competitively.
T: How did you get into the 
sport?
E: I was dragged along to 
all my sisters swim meets so I 
thought it would be more fun to 
swim than to sit and watch.
T: What or whom do you at
tribute your success to?
E: Its been really helpful to 
have the support of my fam
ily, friends, teammates, and 
coaches.
T: Was swimming a part 
of your decision to come to 
Carnegie Mellon?
E: I really enjoyed swimming, 
and I wanted to continue swim
ming in an environment where 
school came first.
T: What is it like to be a firstyear coming into Carnegie 
Mellon and playing a sport?
E: It is nice to have a group 
of people you know you can 
depend on from day one and to 
have upperclassmen to help you 
out in the first couple of weeks.
T: Do you think playing a 
sport gives you a different expe
rience at Carnegie Mellon?
E: I think participating in a 
sport enhances your experi
ence in college because you 
are exposed to new and differ
ent people whom you probably 
wouldnt have met otherwise.
T: How do you manage 
Carnegie Mellons academic 
load and swimming?
E: I try to stay focused and 
stay on top of things, and get 
enough sleep.
T: What accomplishment are 
you particularly proud of?
E: At PIAAs my junior year, 
I placed 11th in the 500-yard 
freestyle with a time of 5:03.02.
T: How does it feel to create 
a school record your first year

T: Do you have a most memo
rable swim meet?
E: It would have to be PIAAs 
my junior year in high school.
T: Do you have a most memo
rable meat?
E: Turkey. Ham is a close 
second.
T: Do you have any personal 
or team goals in mind?
E: I hope we can get relays and 
multiple individuals to NCAAs.
T: What do you think of the 
new Tartans mascot?
E: The Scottie dog is cute, but 
Im not sure how good he would 
look in a Speedo.
T: What are your favorite 
things to do to relax when you 
have the extra time?
E: Watching TV, Top Chef, 
the Steelers, hanging out with 
swimmers and non-swimmers, 
and eating.
T: What are your plans for 
Thanksgiving?
E: I am going home, eating 
turkey, and preparing for the

Carnegie Mellons football 
team needed some fourth- quarter 
heroics en route to coming from 
behind and defeating the visiting 
Gettysburg College Bullets 21-20 
in the ECAC Southwest Bowl on 
Saturday.
With the game on the line, 
sophomore quarterback Phil 
Pantalone completed an 8-yard 
touchdown pass to sophomore 
wide receiver Brendan Howe on 
fourth and goal with 2:09 re
maining in the fourth quarter to 
put Carnegie Mellon up 21-20.
The Carnegie Mellon defense 
preserved the victory with one 
more stand after the ensuing 
kickoff. The Tartans finish the 
season at 7-4 while Gettysburg 
falls to 6-5.
Gettysburg took the open
ing kickoff and marched down 
the field mixing the run with 
a pass to score the games first 
touchdown.
Bullet running back Tom 
Sturges lunged into the end zone 
for a 1-yard touchdown run on 
fourth down to make it 7-0.
Gettysburg tacked on a 
24-yard field goal with 1:19 to 
go in the first quarter up 10-0. 
Their drive started at Carnegie
Mellons own 28-yard line after 
senior safety Jon Scholl fumbled 
a punt.
We had a plan to defend Get
tysburgs offense but we didnt 
execute very well in the first 
half, said junior defensive line
man Clay Crites. Coach Bodnar 
got a little upset; it gave us some 
motivation and we went out the 
second half and started stopping 
them.
Things got worse for the Tar
tans when Sturges rushed for 
his second touchdown, this 
time from 7 yards out, to put 
Gettysburg up 17-0 with 6:48 
remaining before halftime.
Carnegie Mellon, needing
to put points on the board, an
swered with a touchdown drive 
of nine plays and 66 yards, 
capped off by Pantalone throw
ing a 6-yard touchdown pass to 
junior tight end Derek Wisnieski. 
Junior kicker Colin Marks ex
tra point narrowed the deficit 
to 17-7, which is where it would 
stay going into halftime.
At halftime our coaches came 
in and told us to pick it up, play 
like we had been playing in past 
weeks, Howe said. We came 
out flat in the first half, but we 
responded and that just goes to 
show our team character is one

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team stormed into the 
season with a perfect 2-0 record, 
defeating Otterbein College Fri
day and Mount Union College 
Saturday, in the University Ath
letic Association/Ohio Athletic 
Association Challenge hosted by 
Carnegie Mellon.
In the season opener against 
Otterbein, junior guard Colleen 
Light hit a crucial jump shot with 
1:17 remaining to give the Tar
tans a 74-73 lead, which they 
maintained, winning 77-73. The 
game was close throughout, with 
both teams fighting to start off 
their seasons on the right foot.
With less than three minutes 
to play, and the game hanging 
on the line, junior guard Corey
Innes hit a huge three-pointer to 
tie the game at 68.
Otterbein guard Laura Roth, 
who led her team in scoring 
with 23 points, responded with 
a layup, but was answered right 
away by Tartan senior guard 
Leah Feola, who sank a layup of 
her own.
Otterbeins Ana Gamble then 
made a three-pointer and Feola 
sank a jump shot, before a steal 
by junior guard Stacie Aleski led 
to Lights three-pointer, which 
put the Tartans ahead and even
tually led to their win.
Carnegie Mellon had four play
ers in double figures, led by Al^eski 
with 15 points and Innes and Fe
ola with 14 each. Junior forward 
Jeanette Schilling added a spark 
off the bench with 11 points and 
a team-high nine rebounds.

Updating board games Everything you need to know
It was the Parker Brothers, in the conservatory, with the candlestick About wasted lives and Scooper Hos
For those of us who have grown up playing 
Monopoly, Clue, and Life, heres a thought to 
consider: Perhaps the games have grown up 
with us, too. Monopoly, which has always been 
the classic game of hoarding little colored strips 
of paper (i.e., Monopoly money") has now been 
updated to being the classic game of hoarding 
millions in little plastic cards with Visa logos on 
them.
The updating of games doesnt end with 
Monopoly, a new version of Battleship produces 
the explosive sounds of real-life warfare, 
and a new version of Life has an electronic 
"lifepod that helps players keep track of their 
money, property, and time. Even something like 
Candyland hasnt been spared. In the Dora the 
Explorer edition of Candyland, the traditional
versions of the games. For people who are big 
fans of those specific games, a lot of people get 
excited over the special versions, she said. By 
the same token, Im sure there are people who 
prefer the old versions of the games and just keep 
their old copies around.
Along with game updating comes the conversion 
of all-time favorite board games into compact 
video and computer games, often preferable to an 
unwieldy box. Additionally, with the electronic 
versions of board games, you can choose from a 
variety of different versions just at the click of a 
button. Combine that with amazing graphics and 
sounds, and it may seem to be the end of board 
games which actually involve a board. But people 
continue to buy regular board games, boards and 
all.
A Simpsons-style Life has players living in 
Springfield, USA, having unexpected visits 
from sisters-in-law, and trying to lose weight.
gingerbread pawns are replaced by new 
characters: Dora, Boots, Diego, and Backpack.
Then of course, there are the theme games. We 
now have a game on practically every Disney 
movie ever produced, and a whole set of Star 
Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter games. 
There is even a LOTR version of Monopoly, in 
which money becomes power, houses change 
to fortresses, and the player tokens are replaced 
by Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Frodo, Galital, and 
Gandalf. A Simpsons-style Life has players living 
in Springfield, USA, having unexpected visits 
from sisters-in-law, and trying to lose weight. 
There are even themed chess boards which 
feature villains and heroes from different TV 
shows and movies instead of black and white 
chess pieces.
Anne Moffa, an employee at Phantom of the 
Attic, a game store on South Craig Street, 
explained that board games have been updated 
ever since they were brought into the market. 
[In games] that a lot of people know, like Clue, 
you look back at old copies of it and people have 
completely changed, she said. It started in 
England, and Mr. Green was 'Reverend Green, 
and Miss Peacocks been everything from a sort 
of Miss Marple-shy woman to a stylish woman. 
The Spanish version, she added, has people 
named after fruits.
Game updating is probably the favorite 
marketing strategy of all the game makers out 
there, but wont the games sell even without 
all the changes? If there are avid Monopoly 
or Clue fans, wont they still buy the games 
anyway? According to Moffa, some board game 
enthusiasts might be more likely to buy newer
Perhaps the reason board games are still popular 
is that they help players interact with each other. 
One of the things I like about board games is 
the more social aspect; they happen at a more 
leisurely pace and youre not all staring at the 
screen, Moffa said. True, your computer or 
television can be entertaining when your player 
jumps into water or gets thrown into jail, but so 
can the people around you, whenever you get 
into trouble or land on a triple word score.
Updating games says something about the 
creativity of the game makers; it does take some 
effort to preserve what people love about a game 
while adding something new. But the effort 
seems to be paying off, as people continue to buy 
new-and-improved board games.

getting a job at Panera. It seems 
like, despite my upbringing, I 
just dont have much respect for 
a good old college education. 
Should I follow my heart, or just 
suffer through what I have left of 
these lousy four years?
I Dream of Panera
Well, IDOP,
Why exactly dont you respect a 
good college education? You know 
itll help you get a job later on, no 
matter what your degree is  so 
whats your beef? You may say youd 
be happy working at Panera now, 
while you're miserable, at school, 
but I can pretty much guarantee you 
that, once youve been at Panera 
for five years, you might be thinking 
differently. Is the problem really that 
youre not happy with your major? A 
new semesters coming up  why 
dont you take classes in a bunch of 
different fields to see if your passion 
actually lies elsewhere? Or maybe 
Carnegie Mellon isnt doing it for you, 
but another college might, maybe 
even one closer to your family. What 
exactly are you unhappy with? Your 
classes? The atmosphere? The 
drudgery of homework and exams? 
Your lousy friends? Or do you really 
believe that our entire education 
system is meaningless? Throw the 
advice girl a bone here!
You say you want to follow your 
heart and do your own thing, but 
you dont say what this is exactly. 
If you really want to be a singer or 
a painter or a writer or an actress, 
thats one thing, and you should 
go for it - though i'd still advocate 
finishing the degree first, as a 
backup. But if you just want to go 
home and bum around the house, 
play video games, eat your moms 
food, etc., then thats just too bad, 
IDOP Grow up. You can't leech off

your family forever, and you need to 
ask yourself seriously if you'd really

Dear Myrtle,
I work at an unnamed ice cream 
shop in Squirrel Hill, and my 
coworker is driving me crazy. 
Weve only known each other 
for a month, but she finds it 
necessary to tell me extremely 
personal stories about the guys 
she sleeps with and all the drama 
going on in her and her friends 
lives. I really dont want to know 
this stuff, especially when Pm 
trying to work! How can I get her 
to stop?
Shut the Hell Up, Scooper Ho 
Hello SHUSH,
The next time Scooper Ho starts 
getting personal, tell her, Scooper 
Ho, I dont feel comfortable talking 
about this. Why dont we talk 
about X? You can also try saying, 
Sorry, Scooper Ho, I really have to 
concentrate on the customers right 
now, but that will only work when 
there are actual customers in your 
shop. She might get pissed and 
switch from gossip to sniping, but 
hey, at least itll be new material.

Pops performs Mancini
Richard Kaufman conducts classic Americana
Spiffed out in white jackets and black bow ties, the musicians 
of the Pittsburgh Symphony Pops, along with vocalist Monica 
Mancini, evoked an aura of '50s Americana Saturday night at 
Heinz Hall. The concert was part of a series of performances 
called Mancini at the Movies, presented by the Pittsburgh 
Cultural Trust. Conductor Richard Kaufman led the musicians 
in a whirlwind tour of the distinctly American music of Henry 
Mancini: rambunctious marches, cinematic movie scores, and 
smooth jazz.
Kaufman was a personable host and animated conductor, 
introducing pieces with anecdotes. He stirred up a raucous 
big band sound from the ensemble as a whole, while still 
stepping aside for solo improvisations. Monica Mancini, 
the daughter of Henry Mancini, sang a pleasant, albeit 
predictable, medley of some of her fathers most popular 
works.
Of music from Mancini's era, any listener would expect 
a '50s stage band sound, complete with romantic strings 
sliding into silky upper ranges, swelling horn solos, and the 
occasional Latin beat; Saturdays Pittsburgh Symphony 
Pops performance delivered exactly that. "Ohio Riverboat 
from Mancini's Beaver Valley Suite inspired images of rural 
America. During the song,_the musicians of the orchestra 
were all of the sudden transformed into a hoe-down ensemble, 
traveling down a river on a raft with Huck Finn.
The Pops are versatile in style, as demonstrated in the
transition to the solemn, reflective music from Enrico 
Morricones The Mission, which Mancini orchestrated. 
Mancini's music is naturally cinematic, a quality which the 
oboe soloist and the orchestra elegantly portrayed.
For a note of old-fashioned romance, Monica Mancini sang a 
pleasing rendition of Two for the Road" atop oscillating piano 
chords. During the song, movie clips of the dramatic lovers 
from the film of the same name were projected onto a screen 
above the orchestra. Other special effects included colored 
lighting reflecting the essence of the music.
Though, in general, her vocals were pleasing, Mancinis 
performance was easily at its most expressive and heartfelt in 
Music on the Way, which she introduced as a love letter to 
my dad." In addition to her vocals, Mancini's stage persona' 
engaged the audience in an informal manner, anecdotally 
recalling stories of the collaborations between her father and 
his contemporaries. Her stage presence was its own brand 
of unique, making light of a wardrobe malfunction involving 
her earring; she humorously handed the rogue earring to 
Kaufman, who attached it to his lapel.
Overall, the performance, though it did not showcase virtuosic 
qualities, was enjoyable and engaging.

Shara Worden shines as My Brightest Diamond
Classically trained Sufjan Stevens groupie performs at the Warhol
In case you hadnt figured it out by now, the recipe for making 
good music is complicated. First, combine some great lyrics 
and melodies for people to sing (or scream) along to. Add 
some good musicians to give the music some personality and 
emotion. Sprinkle some cool grooves to get people dancing. 
Stir to perfection.
My Brightest Diamond's performance at the Andy Warhol 
Museum last Wednesday was a creative mix of these three 
ingredients (musicianship, songwriting ability, and rhythmic 
creativity). My Brightest Diamond, a.k.a. Shara Worden, is 
an adorable, five-foot-nothing Brooklynite who studied vocal 
performance at the renowned University of North Texas.
The kick start to her professional musical career, however, 
came from something far less academic; she was a touring 
member of indie-folk star Sufjan Stevens's band. (On paper, 
she was the cheerleading captain of the Dlinoisemakers.) 
After touring with Stevens, Worden began working vigorously 
on her first solo album, Bring Me The Workhorse, which was 
released in 2006 to widespread critical acclaim. Worden 
released a remix CD of the album earlier this year, featuring
DJs and electronic musicians re-imagining her work.
Now Worden has gigs all over the world, and its no surprise; 
her music is a tactful combination of her classical background 
and the more exuberant sounds of Brooklyn, and its still 
easily accessible to fans of both styles. (Dont worry; Worden 
wont be the cause of an Opera-Rock category on iTunes.) 
Worden has a fabulously rich voice, over which she maintains 
surprising control. Wednesday night's opening number, 
"Golden Star, was teeming with life. Instead of diva-like 
belting or rock-star-like yelps, Worden was focused more 
on her lyrics and melodies than on unadulterated ferocity. 
Over the pounding of drums, bass, and her own guitar, she 
sang, "Tonight, we rejoice like stars. The tiny auditorium in 
the Warhol pounded just as hard as the music, providing an 
energetic breeding ground for the packed audience to dance 
and chant along.
It's tough to think, though, that a classically trained voice, 
a rock groove, and glitzy lyrics would match. But in My 
Brightest Diamond, there's such a high level of musical craft
that the three components integrate seamlessly. A big part 
of this musical success comes from the fantastic backing 
band, featuring Nathan Lithko on bass and Brian Wolfe 
on drums. Workhorse features strings that harken back to 
Wordens classical days, but her live show was stripped 
down to this three-piece group, bringing out her grimier rock 
tendencies. During the show, Lithkos lines were simple, but 
rock-solid, which left plenty of room for Wolfe to explore both 
intricate polyrhythms and more subtle beats with mallets. On 
"Something of an End, the show's highlight, musicianship,
. melody and production collided in beautiful chaos. Worden 
rolled her ls like a Spaniard as she cried, "Heaven and hell 
come crashing. Underneath, Lithkos bass line is pumping, 
and Wolfe's beat slams like a metal Pog.
If it means endorsing artists like My Brightest Diamond, then 
go ahead, iTunes  make that Opera-Rock category. This is 
music worth endorsing.

Fragile Army invades Pittsburgh
The Polyphonic Spree performs at the Rex Theatre
The sprawling musical collective known as The 
Polyphonic Spree played Pittsburgh for the first time 
last Thursday at the South Sides Rex Theatre. The 
Pittsburgh show found The Spree at the end of its 2007 
tour, with the Rex the second to last venue scheduled 
before the bands return to hometown Dallas, Texas. 
Opening for The Spree were bands The Redwalls (of 
Chicago) and Rooney (of Los Angeles).
The Spree is most recognized and adored 
for its zany big family/army image, and the 
immense, exuberant sound that comes with it.
Rooney, the bigger 
of the two, was 
delightfully power-pop
 the members are all 
under 25, with carefully 
mussed '70s bowl 
cuts, similarly retro
wardrobe selections, and brooding, adorably 
serious countenances onstage. Their music isnt 
easily dismissed, however; although missing lyric 
sophistication, the group had a cohesion and ambition 
in performance that may soon blossom into more original 
lyrics. Perhaps inspired by their tourmates, The Spree, 
the lead singer of Rooney led an engaging sing-along 
that enticed most of the audience members to clear their 
throats and contribute.
Onto The Polyphonic Spree: Some bands are 
acknowledged to be stronger as studio bands  they 
sound great coming through your speakers, but 
live theyre lackluster or fail to make eye contact. 
Alternatively, some bands have a charismatic stage 
presence but can't bring the strength of their live 
performances to their recordings. The Polyphonic Spree 
falls into neither of these unfortunate categories; instead, 
The Spree provides a stunning, uplifting live performance
 backed by respectable studio work.
After Rooney finished its set, the stage at the Rex was 
flooded with people, and then swiftly obscured by a 
long crimson banner, stretched across the stage by two 
Spree members. A tall man lugging a harp made his way 
through the crowd, smiling and apologizing profusely 
as he bumped delighted audience members. This 
was Ricky Rasura, self-proclaimed "rockin plus rollin 
harpist," who contributes vigorous, heavenly arpeggios 
to The Spree's gospel sound. The mysterious red banner 
hid increasingly loud activity from the audience, horns 
and drum sets sounding briefly, while bodies visibly 
nudged the cloth forward. The banner was a neat 
theatrical trick, raising the audiences anticipation so 
that when a low, quivering note finally sounded from 
behind, the crowd erupted with excitement. A pair of 
scissors ripped through the cloth and quickly cut out the 
shape of a heart, tossing the cloth into the crowd; then 
cut straight up and down, parting the banner to reveal 
The Polyphonic Spree in full performance regalia.

arms reading The Fragile Army" and other peace/love 
slogans, the 23 members of The Spree  horn, string, 
and drum sections and a vocal choir  gave the 
audience a heady, heavily danceable set of exhilarating 
symphonic pop. Bandleader Tom DeLaughter marched, 
pranced, and shook his fists, while the female choir 
singers held their hands aloft and sang lustily. 
Instrumental work was just as inspired; although there
were many musicians 
on stage, the resulting 
sound fused together 
without compromising 
any of its parts. The 
crowd was in top 
form, as well, dancing 
feverishly for the entire 
set, and often singing along at DeLaughter's urging. For 
the encore, the band'came back out on stage dressed in 
long, flowing white robes, looking like a gospel choir in 
the middle of a church service. For The Spree, music is 
holy, deserving of white robes and the amount of fervor 
all 23 of them bring to the songs, the stage, and each 
other.
The Spree is most recognized and adored for its zany big 
family/army image, and the immense, exuberant sound 
that comes with it. According to the band's website, 
DeLaughter often brings songs to all the members of The 
Spree, asking each to contribute. During the work on The 
Sprees latest album, The Fragile Army, band members 
worked for no money, with no contract or assurance of 
compensation. This kind of emphasis on teamwork, and 
the love of the music, was obvious in The Sprees live 
performance, where the members were clearly having 
fun on stage.
It didnt hurt that Pittsburgh caught the band at the end 
of their tour, a fact DeLaughter acknowledged to the 
audience. You guys got us.at the right time.... Finishing 
a tour is when you want to see a band," he said. Not 
the beginning. The beginning, they're rough. The end, 
everything is smoother."
Still, it would be an oversimplification to attribute The 
Sprees successful Pittsburgh debut to timing. The 
overall attitude of the band  fierce optimism and 
compassion for the world and each other  is rare and 
welcome in contemporary music. The band's message is 
one of love embracing light and positive energy, values 
that are easily sneered at these, days  but not when you 
have an army (however fragile) at your back.

On Growing
Its hard to find a band with a sound quite like Growing. The groups music 
is at once challenging, unique, and simple. Often grouped as drone/ 
ambient music, a typical Growing track is a 10-minute plus instrumental 
wash, without much obvious variation. No melody. No beat. But, stay 
with me now though the songs may lack variation, theyre not boring.
Growing is Kevin Doria on bass guitar and Joe Denardo on electric guitar, 
although you could hardly guess the instrumentation just by listening 
to most tracks. Its more accurate to say that each musician plays a 
series of effects through pedals and amplifiers, rather than guitars. After 
experimenting for years, Doria and Denardo seem to have found the 
exact sounds they wanted to make, and they continue to break new 
ground.
Growing formed in 2001 in Olympia, Wash, as a three-piece group, 
releasing several cassettes and a video before its first LP, The Sky's 
Run Into the Sea (2003). On The Skys Run, the new sounds werent, 
there yet; the band seemed impatient, with a stadium rock guitar solo on 
almost every track. Following the LP, the third member left, allowing the 
band the creative flexibility that it needed.
Growings next album, The Soul of the Rainbow and the Harmony of 
Light, represents a distinct shift. On Soul, the band seems calmer  
there is no rush to do something artificially interesting. Thus, Doria and 
Denardo are able to use more subtle variations as they move away from 
the guitar sounds to create a serene and enveloping effect. The good 
thing about this kind of ambient music is that it doesnt have to be the 
focus of the listener. Its just as good with the volume low, for somebody 
sitting on the porch reading, as it is when its filling the room completely.
Skip ahead to Color Wheel, the fourth LP. Color Wheel makes you forget 
that the world exists, allowing the mind to wander. Here, the duo has really 
figured out how to make the sounds they want, capable of completely 
overwhelming the listener without brute force. The album has a much 
more dynamic feel, while maintaining the patience of Soul. The opener 
is brilliant, starting out with a soaring overlay of delayed guitar sounding 
like a choir of horns, and a strong rumbling drone that trades focus 
with what can only be described as an incandescent glow  probably 
orange. Eventually the drone fades, and an explosion that's not quite a 
tone comes in at unpredictable intervals, followed by a harsh rhythmic 
sound. The beauty isnt gone though, as the guitarist overlays a more 
continuous stream of bright reflections and huge angelic flourishes at 
just the right times.
Following in Color Wheel's tracks, this years Vision Swim is amazing as 
weli.

The Elixir of Love is wine
Getting drunk woos girls, according to a Donizetti opera
Gaetano Donizetti's 1832 opera The Elixir of Love opened 
last week at the Benedum Center in a performance by the 
Pittsburgh Opera. Donizetti's opera follows a lower-class 
man named Nemorino and his attempts to woo the educated 
Adina. Nemorino suffers an initial setback when soldiers 
come through town; the sergeant Belcore proposes to Adina 
and, despite his egotism, she accepts.
Heartbroken, Nemorino approaches the quack Dr. Dulcamara, 
who has arrived in town to sell his miracle cures. He begs 
Dulcamara for a love potion like the one in a story Adina 
told him, offering all the money he has. The greedy doctor 
gives Nemorino a bottle of wine, which he claims will make 
women find him irresistible. Drinking heavily, Nemorino runs 
into Adina, who is upset to see that he is no longer obsessed 
with her. That night, Belcore asks Adina to marry him right 
away, because he'will be shipping out the next morning 
with his men. Adina agrees to expedite the wedding, and a 
devastated Nemorino doesnt know what to do.
The opera's strongest performers were Elizabeth Futral 
(Adina) and Kevin Glavin (Dulcamara). At the end of Friday 
nights performance, Futral received the strongest applause 
from the audience, with good reason. Not only did her voice
convey the varying emotions of her conflicted character, but 
her acting carried scenes when her co-stars could not. John 
Nuzzo, starring as Nemorino, sung well, but his acting often 
came across as too broad for the plot of the play. Some of 
Nemorino's more humorous actions, like getting drunk off the 
wine he believes to be the titular elixir, were funny without 
being slapstick. However, Nuzzo (who from the audience 
vaguely resembles Erik Estrada in costume) sometimes went 
over the top, like when his character accidentally hit Belcore 
in the groin during a fight; such blatant attempts robs these 
moments of their humor.
In the second act* Nemorino returns to Dulcamara looking for 
more of the love potion, but is unable to afford it. Dulcamara 
is the funniest character of the opera, with garish outfits, 
flustered assistant, and outlandish selling technique. After 
finally finding the money to buy more of the powerful elixir, 
Nemorino happily gets drunk a second time on the advice of 
the doctor.
The Elixir of Love suffered from a disconnect between the 
dialogue of the play and its setting: While the entirety of 
the opera was spoken in Italian (with English subtitles 
shown above the stage), the opera was adapted to America
before World War I. The shift from an opera set in the Italian 
countryside to one set in middle America is successful and 
even elegant; but the subtitles sometimes distracted from 
the action of the characters. At times, it was obvious that 
the subtitles were not direct translations, and sometimes the 
text read like how a Valley Girl would talk, marked with words 
like totally. Overall, the idea to take the early 19th century 
play and bring it to the early 20th century is an interesting 
concept and works in the aspects not dependent on props. 
However, the image of the dejected Nemorino singing in 
Italian while sitting on the bandstand, shows a contradiction 
between the image seen and the music heard. The division 
between the senses is often artistically successful, though not 
practical for the audience to watch because it distracts from 
the subject matter and music at hand.
By the end of The Elixir of Love, the characters have 
straightened themselves out, even humorously, and all is well. 
The show may be formulaic for some of today's audiences, 
but it still manages to create an interesting atmosphere in 
this modernization of Donizetti's classic opera.

Branford Marsalis
Son of jazzs first family to perform
There are few family names that carry th 
same weight as Marsalis in the world of 
jazz. Born out of the old-fashioned rhythm 
and spirit of New Orleans, Ellis Marsalis 
and his six sons have come to embody the 
example of a distinguished musical dynasty. 
Considered by many to be the "first family in 
jazz, the performances and works of father 
Ellis, and most notably those of his sons 
Branford (saxophone).and Wynton (trumpet), 
have made a lastirig impact on a level 
comparable to some of the greatest players 
that have ever taken the stage.
The oldest of the six brothers, Branford is 
most prominently known as a tenor and 
soprano saxophonist, as well as a brilliant 
innovative force in music. Having started 
his career at a young age, Branford was 
playing with Art Blakeys famous big band, 
the Jazz Messengers, while still in his 
early 20s. For over 30 years, Blakeys Jazz 
Messengers has been a temporary home for 
young musicians on their way to becoming 
the most prominent names in jazz  and 
Branford was no exception. Departing from 
jazz in the mid-80s, Branford left his brother 
Wyntons band to tour with Sting for a few 
years, before finally deciding to define his 
own musical direction through the formation 
of the Branford Marsalis Quartet, which is 
still active today. A little over two decades
later, the three-time Grammy-winning artist 
and composer still finds his roots in the art 
of jazz, having performed with such giants 
as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Herbie 
Hancock, and Sonny Rollins.
As he is dedicated to the future of his 
beloved music, perhaps Branford's most 
instrumental contribution has been his 
ability to keep the genre alive through 
his work to spread the message of jazz 
to younger generations. Branford and his 
brother Wynton have spent much of their 
lives bringing jazz into the classroom, 
from the perspectives of both history and 
performance.
Performing at the Byham Theater Tuesday, 
Branford will be sure to present the 
audience with a variety of musical all-stars, 
aside from showcasing his own skillful and 
dynamic playing. So before you head home 
to celebrate Americas sacred holiday, make 
sure to first celebrate her sacred musical 
style  jazz.

East Coast vs. West Coast
California soap The O.C. wins against new hit Gossip Girl
The premise: A new face in town shows lip, causes trouble, 
and tries to make good. This is Gossip Girl, one of the 
fall's few new shows touted for its originality in a season 
encouraging relatively traditional programming.
Its odd, considering that Gossip Girl is so completely 
unoriginal. In fact, the basic description sounds a lot like 
another teen show from five years ago, The O.C. Canceled 
last February, the California teen drama, created by 
writer-producer Josh Schwartz, followed the relationship 
between Chino transplant Ryan and his foster family, the 
Cohens, in the Orange County world of excess.
It should come as no surprise, then, that the producer of 
Gossip Girl is the same man. Schwartz adapted the popular 
teen book series, written by Cecily von Ziegesar, for the small 
screen after The O.C. got the ax. The O.C. was expected to 
maintain its icon status for several years  like predecessor 
Beverly Hills, 90210  until fan-alienating plotlines led to 
dwindling.ratings. The show got back on the track during its 
fourth season, but failed after disillusioned viewers werent 
willing to give it a second chance.
Gossip Girls numbers haven't yet come close to The O.C. 's. 
The shows ratings hold steady at around 2 million broadcast 
viewers a week. But it has strong iTunes sales and ample 
online viewings on the CW website, www.cwtv.com. It has 
already been picked up for a full 22-episode season.
Plenty of television commentators and reviewers have already 
tried to make or break the argument that Gossip Girl is 
the new O.C.  and sure, the comparison is easy to draw. 
Both shows focus on outsiders in a hip society: Serena, the 
source of tabloid fodder on Gossip Girl, left the Upper East 
Side abruptly a year before the shows timeline for boarding 
school, returning in time for the first episode. The O.C. 's Ryan 
is taken in by his lawyer, Sandy Cohen, after stealing a car 
with his brother and being kicked out by his family, only to 
move into posh Newport Beach. Both shows feature plenty 
of drugs, drinking, and sex between dozens of hot young 
characters. On Gossip Girl there are so many characters it can 
become disorienting and confusing, seeing scenes switch 
between the six main characters (and several less-important 
characters, like their parents) during the course of a 41- 
minute episode. The O.C. also featured storylines focusing on 
the teens parents that related to the central plot, while Gossip 
Girl's side stories just slow the pace.
The shows also share the same kind of viewer  both appeal 
to teenage girls, featuring predominantly indie rock music 
on their soundtracks. Its not uncommon to see Marissa and 
Summer wearing designer frocks on The O. C., and the pilot 
of Gossip Girl features characters wearing some real and 
fictional designer duds, including a dress worn by privileged 
character Blair designed by her mother. The Gossip girls strut 
the streets of Manhattan pounding the asphalt like young 
heirs to the fashion-forward crown of Sex and the City's Carrie 
Bradshaw. The O.C., which was more relaxed, featured West
Coast bikini chic, with Seths witty T-shirts pleasing the 
casually dressed viewer.
Perhaps most importantly, both shows focus on drama: Gossip 
Girl's fights come out of a love triangle between Serena, Blair, 
and Blairs long-time love Nate, although a normal romance 
also exists between upper-crust Serena and Dan, the son of a 
musician who reluctantly attends private school.
The love between Serena and Dan looks almost exactly like 
the relationship between Ryan and Marissa in California
 she the daughter of privilege, he the working-class son.
The only difference would be that, in The O.C., the romance 
holding the audiences attention is actually between Seth, 
Ryan's geeky foster brother, and Summer, Marissas equally 
spoiled best friend.
In terms of quality, the better show is unquestionably The
O.C.  the relationship between Ryan and Seth is a show 
on its own, and the romances and arguments surrounding 
the Cohens and their new son are engaging, even when 
the parents move to the forefront of the plot. Still, for pure 
bubblegum factor, Gossip Girl is worth a try. The characters 
arent as sharply drawn as their California counterparts, but 
theres plenty of East Coast prep school snobbery, absentee 
adults, and champagne binges  and while that might be the 
only reason to watch, its certainly a good reason.

The highlight of this weeks dollar 
movie selection is the latest in 
the Harry Potter series. Featuring 
an improved (but not new) cast, 
the trio of wizards offer a perfect 
example of puberty. Continuing 
the plot of Harrys never ending 
struggle with He-Who-MustNot-Be-Named, this fifth film is a 
step up from the previous Potter 
films, but has yet to meet the 
standards of the books.

All you need to know about 
this movie is that it is based on 
a Stephen King novel, telling 
the story of a writer picked up 
from the scene of a car crash 
by a woman claiming to be his 
biggest fan. After watching the 
movie, you will never be able to 
look at a nurse the same way 
again, nor will you take your 
ankles for granted.

rock music gets a new set o
Its a typical nightclub. The sound system is blaring music so 
loud it drowns out any possible conversation, forcing all of the 
dancing, drinking, and smoking twentysomethings to rely on 
body language to communicate.
While all of this is going on, three or four other 
twentysomethings, with their scraggly beards and 
pink-highlighted hair blending into the crowd, set up for a 
live performance. There's the typical complicated process 
of setting up: Cables must be plugged into amplifiers and 
speakers  not to mention be untangled.
But the bar patrons, their senses dulled by six or seven 
$1 Coronas, start to notice that there's going to be live 
entertainment and begin to watch the band set up. Those on 
only their first, second, or third Corona notice something odd
 there aren't any guitars or drums.
That's because the band is Cellofourte. Tate Olsen, Nicole 
Myers, Ben Muoz, and Simon Cummings make up this local 
rock band, which consists of four amplified cellos and no 
vocals, no drums, and certainly no electric guitars. The group 
plays arrangements of heavy metal and rock along with songs 
written by Muoz and Cummings.
On Sunday, Nov. 4, Cellofourte won a battle of the bands 
sponsored by WQED and the John Lennon Education Tour 
Bus. Cellofourte beat out dozens of hopeful bands from 
colleges around Pittsburgh to become one of only five finalists. 
Then, after performing before judges from the music industry 
and a live audience, Cellofourte was named the winner.
As winner, Cellofourte gets to record a CD on board the 
John Lennon bus, a nonprofit, mobile recording studio, and 
will receive 1000 copies of the CD, color jacket and all. Even 
before winning, the band had already started working on 
their second album, due out in January, which will consist of 
original material.
Since 2004, Celloforte has built a solid fan base in Pittsburgh, 
but is always finding new people to impress, like Marvin 
Hamlisch, principal conductor for the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Pops. Hamlisch, an Oscar, Grammy, and Tony award-winning 
musician, invited the group to play with the Pops in 2008.
The group started out in 2004, when Olsen and Myers were 
students in the classical cello program at Carnegie Mellon 
University. Having grown up with rock music and wanting 
to play it on the cello, Olsen got Myers and two other cellists 
together to play some arrangements of heavy metal songs by
Metallica and Led Zeppelin. A few weeks later, a little bit of 
hearsay gave Cellofourte its first gig, and the rest is history. 
Weve come a long way since then," Olsen said.
In 2006, the group recorded a CD, Unsung, featuring 
arrangements of rock and roll songs and one original rock 
song by Cummings, who joined the group as a cellist in 2007. 
They continued playing gigs in clubs around Pittsburgh, 
including Club Caf and Mr. Small's Funhouse & Theatre. 
Things started to pick up during the summer of 2007, when 
the group competed in the Emergenza music competition, 
geared toward unsigned artists. The band won competitions 
in Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio before being eliminated in 
Cleveland after taking second place.
The group has become tight-knit over the years through 
intense practicing and performing. Cellofourte rehearses once 
or twice a week, in addition to playing three to four gigs in the 
city. (Sometimes, only three members can make a rehearsal, 
in which case they call themselves "Cellothreete.)
Both graduates of the School of Music, Olsen works for 
the Pittsburgh Symphony and dresses up as Beethoven 
for promotional gimmicks, and Myers teaches at several 
schools and privately. Cummings is a senior at Carnegie 
Mellon majoring in cello performance, and Muoz is a junior 
at Duquesne University. Cummings and Muoz both plan to 
graduate before devoting themselves totally to Cellofourte.
So, what makes Cellofourte appealing to audiences? The 
group and people close to them say there are many reasons 
why the band is so successful.
Michele Marion, proprietor of Curtain Call, the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Store downtown, thinks that th groups choice of 
recognizable songs like "Stairway to Heaven" grab peoples 
attention, and then they realize its-being played on four J 
cellos.
Marion sells Celloforte's CD, which she originally received 
as a demo from Olsen. Before she started selling the CD- she 
used to have problems playing it in the store, because people 
would hear it and want to buy it, and she didnt have any 
copies to sell. Marion said, I cant tell you how many people 
walked up to the register and said, Is that Evanescence? 
Recently, Muoz and Cummings have been composing 
original rock songs for the group, which is what their second 
album will consist of. The songs sound like rock songs, but 
the powerful sound the cellos can produce when amplified
is often surprising to audiences. Audiences are attracted 
to the groups virtuosity, hands and fingers moving at 
lightning speed, and the complexity of their songs, featuring 
crisscrossing rhythms and sudden changes.
As weve been recording some earlier tunes versus brand 
new stuff, the complexity of what were writing now is at a 
different level than what we were writing early on, Olsen 
said. Its so difficult to nail everything thats going on."
When it comes to composition, Cummings has done his 
homework. He studied composition briefly with Efrain Amaya 
at Carnegie Mellon and learned the music of Schoenberg, 
Webern, Penderecki, Lutoslawski, and many others. He uses 
this classical craftsmanship to write rock songs. I'm sort of 
adventurous. It's not really formulaic at all. I come up with an 
idea, and the way it progresses its more classical," he said.
I include so many rock elements it sounds like a rock song. 
Its not as simple as you think." Still, people have to be able to 
understand the pieces after three beers, Olsen added.
The group's classical training has helped them develop the 
virtuosity and precision that impress audiences. Cummings 
values his classical training: "We wouldnt be able to thrash 
around and lay into the instruments if we didnt have the 
classical background to begin with, he said.
All four cellists studied at times with Anne Williams, longtime 
principal cellist of the PSO, or David Premo, another PSO 
cellist. Inspired by their training, the members of Cellofourte 
rehearse their own music just as they would classical string 
quartets.
We really pick apart the pieces, we dont just throw them 
together, Myers said. That includes two boring hours of 
intonation work and playing the music under tempo. This 
kind of regimen is necessary to perform the songs accurately 
and get the'group comfortable enough to cut loose on stage.
When Olsen started the group, he didnt ask for Williams or 
Premos permission or help, who started to hear rumors of 
a cello rock band before Olsen gave them a demo CD. As 
a teacher, we want our students to be successful," Williams 
said. "I realize there are alternative possibilities, and as long 
as students are able to support themselves doing what they 
love, go for it. I think its fantastic they've been so successful, 
and I credit them for all their hard work and vision.
Premo heard Cellofourte perform at the Emergenza festival 
in Pittsburgh. To say theyre not doing classical isnt
8 f e a t u r e.

disappointing to me, he said. "Theyre trying to invent 
something new."
Premo also taught the group some stagecraft, something 
that isnt taught in the classical world in which both 
Williams and Premo work and teach. He learned 
stagecraft outside of the classic realm, when he was in an 
Army band that played for dessert receptions at the White 
House. In one song, Premo and his bandmates held their 
cellos in place and twirled them. He taught the members 
of Cellefourte the move, which they incorporate into 
their shows.. ,
Cellofourte usually rehearses in the evening as day 
jobs and school eat up the afternoons. Because time is 
so scarce, the group tries to maximize their rehearsal 
time. Once theyve learned a piece, they will rehearse 
it without any sheet music in front of them. While 
practicing, the groups comfort with each other and 
the music is evident. When one member begins at a 
particular spot, the others know exactly where to come 
in, with few words exchanged. The members breathe 
together, look at each other, and lean toward each other 
when playing.
Cellofourtes ensemble skills, honed in rehearsal, have 
been tested in live performance.-The group always made 
fun of Muoz for carrying an extra cello bow, until Olsens 
exploded in the middle of Dream Within during a 
concert. Instinctively, Cummings reached over, grabbed 
the bow, and tossed it to him, and no one has made fun of 
Muoz since.
As Cellofourte has started to get more gigs the last few 
months, the group has experienced growing pains in 
balancing school, day jobs, and Cellofourte. "If we could 
be a touring rock band, and we could just play clubs and 
stadiums or whatever for a living, we would totally do 
that, Cummings said. Myers and the other members 
share that dream, of making Cellofourte their day job. 
Premo thinks the band can make it big, saying the group 
playing in Heinz Field may not be too far-fetched.
So, next time you go out with some friends to a club on a 
Saturday night, or flip on the radio, listen carefully  this 
version of "Stairway to Heaven or the hot new rock song 
may be the sounds of Cellofourte.

Jay Sean debuts in Pittsburgh
Student-run Lush Entertainment hosts concert
Two students from Carnegie Mellon, in coalition with the 
University of Pittsburghs Indian Sub-Continent Association 
(ISA), are bringing one of the biggest recording artists from 
the UK, Jay Sean, to Pittsburgh. The Carnegie Mellon students 
responsible belong to a company called Lush Entertainment, 
headed by junior economics major Sameer Mehta and junior 
chemical engineering major Nadir Hyder.
[Jay Sean] was the first big opportunity to launch the company 
so we jumped on it, said Mehta, who envisioned Lush 
Entertainment about two years ago, along with Phi Kappa 
Theta pledge brother Hyder. Mehta was excited to schedule a 
concert with Jay Sean; he realized how big the artist was while 
sitting in a friends dorm where Jay Sean posters were pinned 
up everywhere, he said. A popular opening concert, Mehta 
explained, will help his company reach its goal  to make 
people have fun and help diversify Pittsburgh.
Sean is a double-platinum artist in the UK and the winner 
of the Best Album, Best Urban Act," and Best Video 
awards at the UK Asian. His hit singes include "Ride It and 
"Eyes of You, the latter hitting number six on the UK pop 
charts; his most popular single, Stolen, reached number 
four on the charts. Sean also appeared in 2005 Bollywood film 
Kyaa KoolHai Hum (We Are So Cool). Sean, who is wildly 
popular in Europe and India, dropped out of medical school* 
to pursue music with fellow artists Juggy D and Rishi Rich, 
both well-known musicians in Europe. Hyder said Sean is an 
"international and cultural icon for South Asians everywhere.
Mehta and Hyder had to work hard to attract Sean to 
Pittsburgh. "We wrote a press release about our company and 
our goals and, at the same time ... we got into contact with 
Jay and other artists, Mehta said. However, we felt that Jay 
suited our demographic the best and that is why we went with 
him. Sean is currently on tour in the U.S., with the goal of 
broadening his demographic outside Europe and Asia, which
Evolving Anger
fits well with the wants of Mehta and Hyder. We expect him 
to open a new market right here in Pittsburgh," Mehta said, 
expecting a sold-out show.
As for the future of Lush Entertainment after the event, Hyder 
wishes to have consistent events, once or twice a month 
throughout the academic year. In addition to hosting concerts, 
he aims to enrich local talent by using student DJs and dancers 
as opening acts.

UK sensation Jay Sean is performing on Friday, Nov. 30.
The avant-garde filmmakers career, from motorcycles to mice
Filmmaker Kenneth Anger, an artist who revolutionized film 
media, visited Pittsburgh last Thursday as part of Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers' Three Rivers Film Festival. Anger spoke briefly 
about his films and his work, and screened his recent pieces as 
well as his older films.
From Angers own description, it was clear that his work 
has evolved in many ways. His career began when he was
17, when he made his first distributed film, 1947s Fireworks. 
Filmed entirely in black and white, Fireworks presents a 
homoerotic fantasy in which the protagonist is beaten by a 
group of sailors, climaxing in. his rescue. The camera angles are 
consistently interesting, with a strong attention to composition 
and lighting. Anger allows the viewer to step right into the 
fantasy, utilizing moments of violence as well as sensuality.
The same is true in another early work of Anger's, Scorpio 
Rising (1963), which is an insight into the lives of motorcyclists. 
Set to pop songs of that era, the film uses imagery* 
incorporating religious symbols, Nazism, and eroticism on 
many different levels. It adds an element of sensuality to the 
rough portrayals of motorcyclists, while still toying with the 
humor in the juxtaposition.
Both Fireworks and Scorpio Rising are indicative of Angers 
style. His films maintain a nice rhythm, while raising questions 
about what sensuality is and where it truly lies. Combining 
violence and humor, Angers works develop meaning deeper 
than the surface of the screen.
Angers later work deviates almost entirely from his original 
concepts. Shot in digital format, most of these videos are 
tributes to objects or artists. For example, Elliot's Suicide (2004) 
commemorates the late Elliot Smith, cutting footage of the 
artist to tracks of his songs. The video is less that experimental, 
replaying some of the deceaseds finest moments. A more 
optimistic piece, Angers Mouse Heaven (2004) pays homage 
to Mickey Mouse with footage of toys and other memorabilia 
synched to popular tunes. The video is whimsical and 
humorous, but nothing like Angers other work.
Angers comprehensive presentation showed how his work 
has changed, from revolutionary works of film, to more 
experimental work in video.
