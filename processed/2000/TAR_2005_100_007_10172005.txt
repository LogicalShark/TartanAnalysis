Student Senator proposes addition to students rights policy
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
For students who feel ostracized in 
the classroom for their personal beliefs, 
a proposed University policy may assure 
them that their grades wont be affected.
At last weeks Senate meeting, Long 
Pham, chair of the Academic Affairs 
committee of Student Senate, presented 
a new amendment he wants added to 
University Policy on student rights: The 
third right of students is to be evaluated 
on the basis of their reasoned answers 
and appropriate knowledge of the sub
jects and disciplines they study, not on 
the basis of their personal beliefs. 
According to Pham, a senior in busi
ness and history, the objective of the new 
text is to promote academic freedom.
Many people feel the university is 
an academic environment in which aca
demic freedom should be promoted. Un
fortunately, faculty members are human 
beings  they have biases  and some 
people feel that interferes with their 
grades, Pham said.
Pham cites that this movement to pro
mote academic freedom is a prevailing 
trend among many universities.
This recent surge of academic freedom
bills follows conservative activist David 
Horowitzs Academic Bill of Rights pro
posal, which he has promoted to several 
state legislatures. In its August 29 issue,

had approved a committee to investigate

Last Saturday night, more than 
35 teams of CMU students danced 
for St. Judes Childrens Hospital 
at the Universitys third annual 
Dance Marathon. One of CMUs 
most popular charity events, this 
years Dance Marathon raised 
over $5600 towards funding re
search and treatment programs 
at St. Judes to benefit kids with 
catastrophic childhood illnesses, 
particularly cancer.
Modeled after Penn States 
Thon, the largest student-run 
philanthropy event in the country, 
Dance Marathon is an all-night 
(8 pm-8 am) dance party that 
changes theme by the hour and in
cludes board games, T-shirt deco
rating, DDR, and refreshments. 
Participants each paid a $20 entry 
fee and were asked to raise $10 in 
donations.
Throughout the night, a giant 
thermometer charted the total 
amount of funds donated. The 
level continued to rise, as Red Bull

[Im] permanence conference features Alan Lightman

Time, music, and art were 
highlighted topics of this weeks 
Center for the Arts in Societys 
[Im]permanence: Cultures in 
and out of Time conference. 
Participants could make the 
most of that time over the week
end by attending over 15 panel 
discussions, a number of gallery 
exhibits, and dance and musical 
performances.
The Center for the Arts in So
ciety, which hosted the weekend 
conference, is a center of inquiry and creativity, according 
to Dean of Humanities and Social 
Sciences John Lehoczky. Spe
cifically, it is a conglomeration of 
the College of Fine Arts and the 
School of Humanities and Social 
Sciences that explores relations 
between art, social change, and 
history.
The conferences events varied 
in content, including panel dis
cussions on various perceptions 
of time, a photography presenta
tion by Martin Prekop, and a talk 
by filmmakers Jeffrey Martin and 
Stephanie Maxwell on their expe
rience in the Center for Fine Arts. 
Robert Escot and Pozzi Cogan
explored links between sound 
and music. In particular, Escot 
talked about spatial relationships 
in music, noting that nearly every 
song had one high point and one 
low point. High and low points, 
as well as different areas of den
sity, can be perfecdy represented 
pictorially in the Rabatman  a 
particular kind of musical nota
tion.
Cogan believes that the musi
cian should create and re-create certain fragile sounds. He 
employs scientific analysis of 
pitch and time to convey par
ticular music pieces. The graphs 
have various shapes, colors, and
shades. The colors represent 
loudness, while boldness rep
resent how pronounced certain 
features are.
Cogan points out that just as 
scientists have new, contempo
rary views of information, so, 
too, do musicians have a new 
view of music that will hopefully 
open sounds of many places and 
many expressions.
In the conferences keynote 
address on Friday evening, phys
icist and novelist Alan Lightman 
set the conferences tone and 
spoke about the differences and

The one-story brick building isnt particularly con
spicuous, but it has prevalent ties with Pittsburghs past 
steel industry. This Saturday, the historic Pump House 
featured the artistic work of three CMU professors - and 
in the coming week, it will play host to a celebration 
over the rights of industrial workers who once made 
mass steel production a possibility.
On Saturday the Industrial Workers of the World will 
celebrate its 100th anniversary at the Pump House, as 
well as in cities like Detroit, New York, and Pittsburgh.
As production became the epicenter for the U.S. econ
omy, labor unions played a large role in protecting the 
rights of the workers. Earlier unions represented only 
a small portion of workers in a factory, making a strike 
less effective. The IWW was one of the first unions to 
promote factory-wide membership.
We were formed in 1905, so that makes us one of
the first labor unions to promote industrial unionisms, 
said Kevin Farkas, event chair for the Pittsburgh branch 
of the IWW. A lot of other unions would discriminate 
based upon race, industry, or sex, but the IWW has had 
a long history of acceptance.
With its member demographics being an array of so
cialists, communists, and all-around disgruntled indus
trial workers, members of the IWW were commonly 
referred as Wobblies.
Wobblies would often stand on street corners 
on top of soap boxes and preach about 
topics, remarked Farkas. Well be doing a lot 
of that next weekend.
The IWW became prevalent among steel 
workers in Homestead during the later 
half of the 19th century, when the 
town became the home of one of the 
largest steel production sites in the 
United States. The Homestead 
Works was a structure of steel

We may log more hours in com
puter clusters than students at 
most other schools. But do we ac
tually learn more than they do?
A recently completed study of 
the interaction between students, 
schools, and learning seems to say 
no.
The research, published in the 
book How College Affects Students, 
details a 30-year study of college 
students and what they actually 
learn at school. Part of the find
ings show that students who at
tend college have a wider range of 
intellectual experiences and bet
ter cognition than those students 
who do not continue on to higher 
education.
But what the findings dont 
show are differences in how much 
students learn from school to 
school. That means, according to 
the research done by Ernest Pascarella and Patrick Terenzini, stu
dents at various institutions like 
Ivy League and technical schools 
may not end up learning more 
than their peers at state and com
munity colleges.
But is learning a quantifiableSee SURVEY, page A5

term? And is learning subjective 
to each individual student?
Junior business major Svetiana 
Sandler explains, I dont think I 
would go to Carnegie Mellon if 
I thought I could get this type of 
education just anywhere.
In response to questions such as 
these, a former president of Ho
bart and William Smith Colleges 
and Trinity College, Richard H. 
Hersh, follows up on the findings 
of this study in his recent article in 
The Atlantic Monthly, What Does 
College Teach?
He notes two explanations for 
why there may be no differences 
in learning across schools. One 
places the emphasis on students 
and individual achievement 
 you only get out of the experi
ence what you put into it. Hersh 
notes, Its not just a perverse 
status-consciousness that makes 
higher education the only indus
try in which competitors are rated 
on the caliber of their customers 
rather than on their product.
The other, more persuasive ex
planation, explores the idea that 
current testing measures are not 
effective tools for evaluating stu
dent learning after the completion

Construction is set to begin today on 
the third floor of the University Center, 
transforming the largely underused 
lounge above Skibo Coffeehouse into 
new student organization offices. Uni
versity Provost Mark Kamlet approved 
the plan last Friday.
The Old Student Center and the West 
Garages are to be demolished to make 
room for the Gates Center for Com
puter Science, which had left many 
student groups scrambling to get new 
space for their activities.
The Old Student Center and the West 
Garages together house student groups 
including SoHo, the Photo Club, CMU 
EMS, Pioneers, the Society of Auto
motive Engineers, and CIA.
This new construction on the third 
floor of the UC will provide space to 
some of the groups being displaced, 
but a plan to relocate the remaining 
groups to the basement of a renovated 
East Campus Garage has yet to be final
ized.
Cheers to the Office of Student 
Activities and student government for 
the work they have done so far. Lets 
hope the East Campus Garage base
ment project comes to fruition speed
ily.
In the process of developing a plan 
to accommodate those who would be 
displaced student government and 
the Office of Student Activities faced 
broader questions; particularly about 
the lack of student space at Carnegie 
Mellon. After resolving the immediate 
crisis, however, Im afraid that efforts 
to resolve the larger problems will fall 
to the wayside.
CMU students still need a place of 
our own  somewhere welcoming 
and useful to all students and student 
groups. Some would say that the UC is 
that place, but CMU opted to create the 
University Center, not a student center.
Of course, many students pass 
through the UC, eat there, or exercise 
there. But the student-oriented areas 
are not contiguous; they are broken up 
by the first and second floor, which are 
more geared toward hosting confer
ences and meetings. The vast majority 
of students dont even know that the 
third-floor student organization offices 
exist.
In the early stages of planning to ac
commodate the students who will be 
displaced by the construction for the 
Gates building, the Office of Student 
Activities and Student Government 
entertained and advocated a number 
of compelling proposals. Among them 
was the suggestion of allocating space 
in the University Center basement to 
student organizations. With WRCT, the 
mailroom, and a new eatery and game 
room, the basement of the University 
Center has the potential to be a student 
hub. That sort of development might 
have been a step in the right direction.
But there wasnt the support from 
above. The agreed-upon fix addresses 
only the problems direcdy caused by 
the construction of the Gates Center.
As it stands, moving more student 
groups to the third floor of the UC will 
increase  if only slightiy  the cen
tralization of student organizations on 
campus. But the third floor is still invis
ible to most of the student body.
It is a disservice to students that stu
dent government, student media out
lets, and cultural and special-interest 
groups are strewn across the UC and 
across the campus, tucked away in un
known corners. It is no wonder that 
these groups have had a difficult time 
communicating and collaborating.
A centralized, functional student 
center would facilitate interaction and 
promote unity among students and 
student groups. It would give students 
and student groups common ground 
 literally  where they have none 
now.
I know this cant happen overnight, 
but its got to be done. Developing the 
UC into a true student center, or creat
ing an all-new student center, should 
enter the planning stages now  so 
the next time an opportunity to make 
some big changes comes along, stu
dents dont get passed by again.

Dance Marathon supports
cancer research, victimsHarvard hosts business conference for women
by Elizabeth Schwartz
Assistant Production Manager
Following on the heels of their 
high ranking in The Wall Street 
Journal, the Tepper School of 
Business sent 34 female under
graduate students to the Harvard 
Undergraduate Women in Busi
ness first annual Intercollegiate 
Business Conference.
Held in Boston on Saturday, 
the conference offered an open 
invitation to attendees. Some 
universities such as Carnegie 
Mellon were considered target 
schools, according to Jennifer 
Novak, a Harvard student and 
the officer in charge of Harvard 
Undergraduate Women in Busi
ness external relations.
For the past four years, Har
vard Undergraduate Women
in Business (HUWIB) has held 
a similar event specifically for 
Harvard Universitys students. 
This years theme was Lead
ing Today: Taking Hold of Our 
Future. The Intercollegiate 
Business Conference kicked off 
with a keynote address given by 
Janet Hanson, managing direc
tor of Lehman Brothers and the 
founder of Milestone Capital and 
85 Broads.
Other activities planned in
cluded individuals from vari
ous business related fields. We 
wanted to show students that 
there is more to business than 
investment banking and consult
ing, explained Novak.
Fields represented at the con
ference were marketing, entre
preneurship, and journalism, 
among others. Scheduled be
tween panels was a presentation
given by the admissions office of 
Harvard Business School.
Opening the conference to all 
majors and other colleges offered 
several great opportunities. 
Its nice to open it up to other 
schools, said Novak. That way 
we can get better speakers, better 
location, and better panelists.
In addition to improved con
tent, Novak presented another 
goal  networking. [The Inter
collegiate Business Conference] 
allows you to talk to people you 
normally wouldnt get a chance 
'to, she explained.
Days before the event itself, the 
Conference sold out and HUWIB 
members in charge of enroll
ment actually had to turn peo
ple away due to a lack of space. 
Susan Timko, a consultant with 
Carnegie Mellons Career Center 
who was involved in getting the
word out to CMU students, re
marked, Its great that so many 
people are interested. Harvards 
taken a great lead and been very 
proactive.
HUWIBs website offers their 
mission statement: Harvard Un
dergraduate Women in Business 
seeks to empower a dynamic 
group of enterprising young 
women, uniting them through 
business education and experi
ence. Their activities also fea
ture various trips to New York 
City and skill-building work
shops.
One goal of the conference 
was to set off a trend and en
courage other businesswomens 
groups and promote the same 
cause, Novak said. She believes 
that the overwhelming response 
in the student business commu
nity will help to do just that.

He stressed that although St. 
Judes is based in Memphis, Tenn., 
its research is shared with fami
lies throughout the country and 
all over the world. Though there 
are no children currently being 
treated from the Pittsburgh area 
by St. Judes, Reczek did confirm 
that there are several children in 
the greater western Pennsylvania 
region that are. In addition, the 
research and treatment progress 
made at St. Judes is constantly 
being utilized the children and 
doctors from the Pittsburgh area 
as it becomes available.
St. Judes has successfully 
treated more childhood cancer 
patients than any other child
hood cancer research center in 
the world. Since the hospitals 
opening in 1962, groundbreak
ing research has brought the 
survival rate of children with the 
most common forms of childhood 
cancer up from 25 percent to 
80 percent.
When asked her favorite part

STEEL, from A1
mills owned by CMUs founding 
father Andrew Carnegie.
Today, the Pump House, one of 
the few remnants of Homesteads 
former steel boom, stands on the 
outskirts of the Waterfront, nes
tled between warehouses and the 
Monongahela River. A brick struc
ture erected during the turn of the 
20th century, the Pump House re
mains a venue for many cultural 
events in Pittsburgh.
The building stands on the very 
site of the Battle of Homestead, 
an intense conflict between strik
ing unionized workers and the 
owners of the steel mill. What 
started as a protest at 3 am on 
July 5,1892, soon developed into 
an all-day standoff.
The conflict started when 
Henry C. Frick, the general man
ager to Andrew Carnegies Home
stead plant, began to cut wages 
and tried to split the Amalgam
ated Association of Iron and Steel 
Workers. After workers began to 
strike, detectives from the Pinker
ton Agency were called in to re
spond to the striking workers.
But the Pinkertons met with 
heavy resistance as their barges 
pulled up to dock during the 
darkness of early morning, and 
they were held off by the union
workers, who had pumped oil 
into the river in an attempt to set 
it on fire.
The Battle of Homestead is fa
mous not only because of its land
mark history in unionized protest, 
but also because it saw the use of 
the first form of state police, as 
Pennsylvanias governor called 
in the states militia to quash the 
revolt. The revolts leaders were 
eventually, brought to trial, but 
none were ever convicted.
Over 100 years after the Battle 
of Homestead, the land surround
ing the Pump House has seen pro
lific change as the massive steel 
mills, once the heart of Pittsburgh 
industry, were deconstructed.
This past weekend, the Pump 
House hosted an event chroni
cling the change. Titled Revisit
ing Post-Industrial Homestead, 
it featured the photography of 
professor Charlee Brodsky and 
the poetry of professors Jim Dan
iels and Jane McCafferty.
When [Brodsky] started pho
tographing Homestead, in light of 
the Waterfront development and 
everything, it really intrigued me 
as a writer because Im interested 
in contrasts and juxtapositions, 
Said Daniels. Its been a part of 
my work to try and examine the 
lives of working people in a way 
that the arts dont always do.
DANCE, from A1
representatives including sopho
more design student Paul Recalde 
passed out free drinks to keep the 
dancers energized.
Although Dance Marathon 
was held in Rangos Ballroom last 
year, this year UC Wiegand Gym 
accommodated even more par
ticipants. Although Wiegand was 
untraditional to book, it allowed 
for more extensive decoration 
and a larger dance floor.,
Dance Marathon director 
Megan Laskowski attributed the 
events success to the fact that 
its participants could both have 
fun and donate to a worthy cause 
simultaneously. Although firstyear morale team member Seena 
Mehrabanzad admitted that he 
was initially enticed by the idea 
of dancing all night long, he 
eventually echoed Laskowskis 
sentiment: Id give even if some
one just asked me to. This is 
cooler.
It was also the first CMU Dance 
Marathon for Ryan Reczek, the

vania. However, compared to sim

Breast cancer is of the leading causes of death among women in the USA. One of 
. every nine American women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime.
Factors that increase a woman's risk for breast cancer are; a positive family history 
in a mother or a sister, menstruation at an early age, late menopause, childless. ness, first pregnancy after age 30, radiation exposure, a high fat diet, obesity and 
moderate or greater alcohol consumption. If detected early, breast cancer has an 
excellent chance for cure, That is why monthly self-breast exams are so important.
In addition to self examination, you should see your health care provider for a 
routine check-up, including a breast exam, at least one a year.

There is an increased risk of developing testicular cancer in an individual with a 
history of undescended testicle or an inquinal hernia In childhood.
If testicular cancer is detected early, it is almost 100% curable. That is why testicu

Breast self exams should be performed at the same time each month. The best 
time is 3 or 4 days after the monthly period has ended, when the breasts are least 
tender and swollen. If you are taking birth control pills you should examine your 
breasts on the day you start your new pack of pills.
Begin the exam by standing before a mirror and inspecting the breasts with arms 
at your sides and then over your head.
Then place your hands on your hips 
and tighten your chest and arm 
muscles. Observe for any asymmetry 
of the breasts, masses, or dimpling of 
skin.
The remainder of the exam can be 
performed in the bath or shower or 
while lying down on your back. Place 
your right hand behind your head.
With your left hand move the pads of 
your fingers over the entire right breast 
in small circular motions beginning at 
the outer most portion of your breast 
and making circles inward towards the 
nipple. Be sure and examine al! portions of your breast including the armpit and 
nipple. Gently squeeze the nipple to see if any fluid comes out. Repeat the proce
dure for the other breast.
 Examine your testicles at least once a month while you are in the shower.
* Roll each testicle between the thumb and first three fingers until the entire sur
face has been covered. The testicles should feel round and smooth, like hardboiled eggs.
 Be on the lookout for lumps, irregularities, a change in the size of the testicle, or 
a dragging sensation. All of these are possible signs of a tumor. If you find any of 
them, consult your health care provider at once. Remember, you need to exam
ine only the testicles themselves, not the sperm tubes or blood vessels that are 
also in the scrotum.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 17, 2005
Students raise awareness of earthquake victims needy situation
by Matthew Campbell
Copy Staff
In the aftermath of the earth
quake that struck Pakistan 
and neighboring countries on 
October 8, many are unable 
to grasp the enormity of the 
earthquakes impact. The quake 
struck with a magnitude of 7.6; 
the Associated Press reports esti
mates from the Pakistani military 
that there are 40,000 dead and 
62,000 injured. This earthquakes 
magnitude was only slightly less 
powerful than that of the great 
earthquake that decimated San 
Francisco in 1906.
But some were still unaware 
of its impact. I didnt even know 
about the earthquake until you
[the reporter] asked me about 
it, said Nick Hudson, a first-year 
music major. The. only news I 
watch is The Daily Show with Jon 
Stewart.
Samiah Akhtar, the secretary of 
the Muslim Students Association, 
said, The people who know 
about the earthquake are the 
ones who keep up with the news. 
Sometimes college students are 
known for not knowing whats 
going on. So, one of our goals 
is to raise awareness of what 
happened in the next few 
weeks.
People respond to the things 
that affect them the most. 
Katrina was more pertinent to 
many ... than the earthquake. I 
personally responded more to the 
earthquake because I have family
there, she added.
Mayur and the Muslim Students 
Association have been spearhead
ing efforts to provide relief for the 
earthquake victims. They have 
been working with off-campus 
organizations, including local 
mosques and charities, and are 
coordinating on-campus activities 
including fundraisers with other 
student organizations. These ac
tivities are still in the stages of 
planning.
Many charity organizations are 
not expecting as extraordinary 
a reaction to the earthquake as 
there was to Hurricane Katrina 
because of the proximity of these 
two disasters. In addition, chari
ties have also been responding 
to floods in South America that 
have killed hundreds. According.
to the San Francisco Chronicle, 
donations for Hurricane Katrina 
in a six-week span amounted to 
$1.8 billion. This amount was 
greater than donations after 9/11 
and the South Asian tsunami ca
tastrophe. A host of organiza
tions, including the American 
Red Cross and Catholic Relief 
Services, have so far reported 
smaller donations for the earth
quake in comparison to Katrina in 
the same amount of time.
Some student organizations, 
like the Asian Students Association 
(ASA), are not participating in re
lief activities for the earthquake. 
ASAs president, Kristen Hwang, 
was heavily involved in found
ing K.A.R.E. (Katrina Aid and 
Relief Effort), which is actually 
contributing to relief efforts for
the earthquake. ASA continues 
to support K.A.R.E. However, the 
ASA has to shift its focus to other 
activities. *
Lu Zhang, the treasurer of ASA, 
detailed some reasons for not re
sponding to the earthquake: We 
wont be hosting or participat
ing in any events intended for 
relief for the earthquake vic
tims. Part of the reason is that 
November, which is recognized 
as CMUs Asian Heritage Month, 
is fast approaching and well be 
having the busiest month of the 
semester during it. Another rea
son is that we just completed a 
large event with the intention of 
raising money for Katrina vic
tims.
Often communication and co
ordination between campus orga
nizations is sluggish. Zhang said, 
Certainly, for me at least, the 
most frustrating obstacle about 
organizing large events with 
many other student groups is the 
apparent division in our campus. 
We can see.it through race, gen
der, culture, you name it, we have 
it. Theres just an overabundance 
of cliques, and I feel that ASA is 
always more or less classified as 
one such clique for Asians rather 
than taken as a serious student 
organization.
Akhtar thinks that the pres
sures of time will outweigh group 
differences. Theres a sense of 
urgency for us to get going. More 
and more people are dying every 
day. Pakistan doesnt have the 
resources to cope with a disaster 
of this scale.

similarities between artists and 
scientists. In particular, Lightman 
praised math for its shining pu
rity. Youre guaranteed an an
swer clean and crisp as a $20 bill, 
said Lightman.
But people arent as logical and 
precise as mathematical answers, 
Lightman cautioned. Personal ex
perience and emotion are impor
tant factors in, for instance, inter
preting a novel.
According to Lightman, artists 
and scientists are similar in that 
they both invent worlds of their 
own. He gave the example of a 
physicist who must consider theo
retical situations to test ideas. For 
instance, scientists hypothesize 
about the String Theory  that 
all matter, even atoms, is com
posed of tiny strings. The novelist, 
too, creates a unique world by al
lowing the reader to use his or her
head and heart to connect with 
characters.
An astrophysicist who gradually 
moved into writing novels, Light
man has had experience in both 
situations.
According to Lehoczky, the techoriented community at Carnegie 
Mellon benefits from having a 
broad-based thinker like Lightman 
as a speaker. Such events, he said, 
help to create new dialogue be
tween humanists and artists.

Student rights amendment proposed by Student Senator
PROPOSAL, from A1
the need for such a bill. Pham ac
knowledges that his own proposal 
draws its language from a portion 
of Horowitzs bill.
Lets face it, Pham said. Ninety 
percent of faculty members in institu
tions of higher learning are reported 
to be liberal, and they run into con
flict with students who like to advo
cate more conservative views.
Pham asserts that there are no 
political motivations in his en
deavor. Were trying to divorce it 
from outside interests. Were mak
ing this purely a Carnegie Mellon 
issue  purely an effort to promote 
... free thought and scholarly think
ing.
Regarding the process that cre
ating such a policy would take,
Provost Mark Kamlet said, If one 
wanted to create an official Univer
sity policy... it has to go through a 
fairly long process in terms of the 
number of groups who have to 
approve it along the way. Those 
groups would include the faculty 
senate, the Presidents Council 
[deans and senior administrators] 
... and it would have to be approved 
all the way up the chain.
In August, both Provost Kamlet 
and University President Cohon 
told The Tartan they were not in 
support of Horowitzs Academic 
Bill of Rights being passed on the 
Pennsylvania state level. However, 
there is no current indication that 
Phams proposals for CMU will 
mirror the one being lobbied for in 
state legislature.
Pham also plans to move to big
ger and better things, if his ini
tial proposal is passed, including 
instituting a holistic and complete 
learning experience.
Baby steps, he said at last 
Thursdays Student Senate meet. ing. Baby steps.
Were thinking about, to be hon
est, taking a look at the professional 
conduct of professors, Pham con
tinued in an interview. Our goal is 
not to tell professors how to behave, 
but rather to give them ideas in how 
to better enhance and promote their 
own goals for the classroom.
After having met with Pham to 
discuss his plan, Vice Provost for 
Education Indira Nair said she 
agrees with his ideas.
The proposed additions to the 
Students Bill of Rights is a good 
one. Long and his Committee have
sought to make them clear and 
add one clause that is a good one 
 to judge students on their work 
and demonstration of mastery of 
content rather than on personal 
opinions.
Nair also thinks the proposal 
will take a while before it can be 
passed.
Current University policy in
cludes language to preserve aca
demic freedom: [Mutual trust and 
respect] require freedom of expres
sion without fear of retribution, 
institutional or otherwise, and 
value the diversity of persons, 
ideas and choices differing from 
ones own.
University policy also includes 
a procedure through which a stu
dent may appeal a grade that he or 
she feels is unreasonable.

SURVEY, from A1
of a college degree. As of 
now, it may be that the tests 
are unable to detect distinc
tions between the amount 
students learn across college 
campuses.
Hersh and his colleagues, 
who form the Collegiate 
Learning Assessment Project, 
might have an answer to the 
dilemma of how to accurately 
quantify learning: a two part 
evaluative test administered 
at the end of ones college 
education, including what 
he calls a performance task 
exam as well as an analytical 
writing exam in which one 
must refute or support an 
imaginary argument.
Janet Stocks, assistant vice 
provost for education for 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
says its a complex situation.
Different schools appeal 
to different students, she 
says. There is an interaction 
between the institution and 
the students who choose that 
institution.
Stocks, a sociologist, also 
believes it is difficult to accu
rately measure learning with 
any type of paper and pencil
test. What we would hope is 
one learns how to learn. The 
student will know where to 
go to get information, and 
have some idea of the best 
way to start to solve a prob
lem that there is not a recipe 
for.
By instituting tests using 
value-added assessment, 
Hersh warns that it tells us 
only how schools are doing in 
relation to their competitors, 
not what absolute standard of 
excellence they should be set
ting. Nor should it be allowed 
to crowd out other measures 
 particularly affordability 
and equity  that bear on 
how we judge a schools qual
ity.
As Hersh points out, quali
ties such as small class sizes 
and alumni relations are all 
subjective measures that at
tract certain sets of people, 
but are schools and the stu
dents that use these stan
dards to choose schools bet
ter off this way? According 
to the Collegiate Learning 
Assessment Projects prelimi
nary research, time and fur
ther testing will be the deter
mining factors in answering 
this question.

17 October 2005 THE TARTAN A6
by Christine deBriffault
Junior Staffwriter
This past Wednesday began 
with an announcement of the 
creation of the Center for Sus
tainable Engineering, a collabo
ration between Cliff Davidson of 
Carnegie Mellon, David Allen of 
the University of Texas at Aus
tin, and Brad Allenby of Arizona 
State University. The Centers 
mission is to educate academia 
about environmental problems 
and solutions. Education is 
key to conserving the environ
ment, Davidson said. With ev
eryone involved it will make a 
difference.
Sustainable engineering 
hopes to reduce current envi
ronmental problems by devel
oping solutions that will last* 
and benefit future generations. 
In an October 5 press release 
from Arizona State University, 
Allenby said, In the past, engi
neers have been able to pretty 
much focus on technical issues. 
But today we live in a very dif
ferent world, one that requires 
us to be smarter about the social 
and environmental implications 
of our designs and our tech
nologies. We need to continue 
to provide a high quality of life 
with less impact on our natural 
resources.
Davidson, Allen, and Allenby 
have designed workshops to 
promote sustainable engineer
ing education for engineering 
faculty. Davidson, a professor 
of civil and environmental engi
neering and principal investiga
tor for the project, expects that 
these teachers will go back and 
incorporate engineering prin
ciples into their classrooms.
The Center is funded by the 
National Science Foundation, 
which donated $1.7 million 
to run the workshops and the
See CENTER, page A7
A knot, in the conventional 
sense, is an intertwining rope 
or string usually designed to 
tie objects (or shoelaces) to
gether. Take a piece of rope, 
twist, pull, and loop it a few 
times and you get a hitch knot. 
Loop it again and you get a half 
hitch knot. Loop it some more 
and you get a cow hitch knot. 
Glue those ends, of the rope to
gether, though, and you get a 
mathematical knot.
A knot, in the mathematical 
sense, is a conventional knot 
on a closed loop. Thus, math
ematical knots lack loose ends. 
This is a critical, fundamental 
difference between mathemat
ical knots and the knots we tie 
every day. Regular knots can be 
easily untangled by manipulat
ing the loose ends of a rope; 
mathematical knots cannot.
Given this definition, a plain 
rubber band can also qualify as 
a mathematical knot. This loop 
a complete circleis indeed 
a special kind of mathematical 
knot and is given its own name: 
the unknot.
Surely at this point, some of 
you are scratching your heads. 
If an unknot is just a loop, is it 
possible to untangle a math
ematical knot into an unknot? 
Think about it. If a mathemati
cal knot can be transformed into 
an unknot without cutting it up 
and gluing it back together, the 
knot never existed in the first 
place  and knot theory is in 
trouble. If one can prove that 
it is impossible to transform a 
knot into an unknot, however, 
the existence of knots is proven 
 and knot theory is saved.
Proving the existence of 
knots was a longstanding chal
lenge in knot theory. In the 
1930s, Kurt Reidemeister took 
a step in that direction by show
ing that all transformations
between knots can be reduced 
to three basic moves. These 
moves  the twist, the cross, 
and the poke  are collectively 
referred to as the Reidemeis
ter moves. Two mathematical 
knots are topologically equiva
lent if one knot can be trans
formed into the other by a finite 
series of twists, crosses, and 
pokes. If Reidemeister moves 
are incapable of transforming 
a knot into an unknot, the exis
tence of knots is proven.
The proof itself is surpris
ingly intuitive, and can be fol
lowed by drawing a trefoil knot 
as a curve on a sheet of paper, 
with breaks where the knot 
crosses itself. It has three sec
tions. These sections can be 
colored with three different 
colors so that at each crossing, 
the three sections involved 
have either the same color, 
or three different colors  a 
property called tricolorability. 
Reidemeister moves preserve 
tricolorability, but the singleloop unknot has only one sec
tion and thus one color. So no 
amount of twisting and pulling 
can turn a tricolored knot into 
a single-colored unknot.
Why knots? The fascination 
with knots began in the 1800s, 
when scientists still believed 
that a luminiferous ether per
vaded the universe. Lord Kelvin 
proposed that every element 
should have a distinct signa
ture based on its entanglement 
with the ether, prompting 
mathematicians and scientists 
alike to conjure up pictures 
of knots. Although the theory 
about luminiferous ether was 
eventually disproved, mathe
maticians continued to pursue 
knot theory on purely abstract 
grounds for over a century.
In the 1980s, knot theory 
again found itself at the fore
front of science this time 
in biology. DNA can be visual
ized as a convoluted knot that 
has been stretchd, coiled and 
packed into the cells nucleus.
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff
Topoisomerase enzymes must 
quickly untangle this knot to 
allow replication and transcrip
tion to occur. By modeling DNA 
as a closed loop, scientists were 
able to obtain a quantitative 
measure of DNA packing. To
pology also allowed research
ers to examine the enzymes 
ability to untangle and tangle 
complicated knots in a quick 
and efficient manner.
Other esoteric and far-flung 
applications of knot theory are 
delightful to peruse at ones 
leisure. Interested readers can 
check out molecular knots and 
topological stereoisomers in 
Erica Flapans When Topology 
Meets Chemistry. Physicists 
can flip through Dirk Kreimers 
Knots and Feynman Diagrams. 
The ardent non-scientist is 
encouraged to take his shoe
lace and explore the 800 ways 
to tie it to his desk. I, for one, 
am profoundly impressed that 
this is an entire article on knots 
 with knot one pun.

were announced Friday. Pittsburgh Syn
ergy took 10th place overall in the com
petition. Stephen Lee, Pittsburgh Synergy 
team leader, spoke positively about the 
results: The Pittsburgh Synergy Team
placed in the top five in the juried events 
that we worked diligently on  Archi
tecture (fourth place), Dwelling (fourth 
place), Electric Lighting (third place), and 
Daylighting (fifth place). In the engineer
ing contests, we took fourth in the energy 
balance contest. This was very important 
to us.
Unfortunately, the weather was cloudy 
throughout the Decathlon, leading Lee to 
deem this event the Battery Decathlon, 
since the team with the biggest batteries 
won. We refused on principle to compete 
in the Battery Decathlon, said Lee. Our 
battery storage was designed for three 
days without sun, and the winning team 
had a storage capacity of four times ours.
The winning team turned out to be 
BioShip from the University of Colorado, 
which also won the 2002 Decathlon. Lee 
said that BioShip charged their batteries 
in the Colorado sun and ran their house 
on the batteries for the entire competi
tion. This allowed the Colorado team to 
score big in the Getting Around portion 
of the competition, in which teams use ex
cess solar energy to drive electric cars as 
far as possible. According to Lee, BioShip 
drove their car over 300 miles, compared 
to ours at 13 miles.
Predictably, scoring for competitions 
in their formative years can depend on 
technicalities. Future competitions wil be 
able to draw from past experience and be 
more fair. For example, the 2002 Solar De
cathlon was criticized for allowing major 
corporations to build some teams houses. 
Fortunately, that loophole was closed this 
time around.
Lee feels that his team played fair, 
When Synergy had energy, we ran the ap
pliances and operated the house in good 
faith; when we had no energy, we shut all 
the systems down. He also said that he 
will press the organizers to alter competi
tion rules, such that holistic thinking is 
rewarded over gaming the system.
The Tartan caught a bus at 
6 am on October 8 to be on location at the 
Solar Village, talk with Lee, and get a feel 
for the competition.
Despite the early hour, practically every 
seat was filled, as an eclectic mix of CMU 
students and staff prepared to tour the So
lar Village. Upon arrival in Washington, 
D.C. four hours later, the air was drip
ping with irony. Foreboding storm clouds 
blocked the suns rays and a downpour 
began the moment visitors stepped off the 
bus, soaking,everyone to the bone.
Yet, as promised, the Solar Village was 
arrayed on the National Mall, the tiny 
dwellings elegantly framed by the tall 
spire of the Washington Monument at one 
end, and the grand Capitol building on 
the other. In the rain, the houses appeared 
highly inviting. Teams cheerfully invited a 
drenched public into their carefully mani
cured spaces.
Each house was unique, both in exte
rior architecture and interior design. One 
could easily imagine living in some of the 
houses, and many tourists asked the same 
question: Is it for sale? The New York 
Institute of Technology teams hydrogen 
power and hanging loft was especially 
fascinating, along with the Virginia Poly
technic Institute teams water-purification 
ponds and parabolically-shaped ceiling, 
and the Rhode Island School of Design 
teams rooftop garden.
Pittsburgh Synergys address was So
lar Village Lot 114, specifically chosen 
by Lee so the slanting roof would receive 
maximum sun. The house seemed rather 
popular, and even with the rain, tourists 
with their children werewaiting in line to 
get inside.

Pittsburgh Synergy takes 10th 
at Solar Decthlon in D.C.
SOLAR, from A6
Lee said, The house is hold
ing up very well. We have learned 
that small children love to touch 
everything and to open faucets 
and water coolers. Every time we 
turn around, there is a new pool 
of water on the floor.
Although they lacked sun, the 
well-insulated houses proved 
impervious to the cold. Inside, 
the atmosphere was cheery and 
bright, as the tour guides ex
plained the various features of 
the houses.
Lee explained that Pittsburgh 
Synergys goal was to build a 
passive solar house that required 
minimum external energy to be 
livable. In the end they were 
successful. According to Lee, we 
never turned on the heating or
cooling systems and our house 
remained in the expanded ther
mal comfort zone for 100 percent 
of the competition. ,
While it is easy to get caught up 
in the numbers, its important to 
realize that simply participating 
in the Solar Decathlon was a 
victory for the team. The house 
represents heroic feats of fund
raising, construction, design, 
and initiative, and collaboration 
from more than 50 volunteers 
from four schools and outside 
organizations. The house was 
truly cross-disciplinary, combin
ing science and design, art and 
architecture to achieve a worthy 
goal.
Overall, Lee said, the level 
of design and innovation was an 
order of magnitude better in this 
competition than 2002.

I wasnt using my academic rights, anyway
This past summer, the battle over po
litical bias in higher education sneaked 
closer to home when the Pennsylvania 
state legislature voted to investigate the 
matter. But we wake up this week to 
find that the issue is looming closer than 
ever.
Last Friday, Long Pham, the chair of 
the Academic Advisory Committee of 
Student Senate, formally proposed to 
Vice Provost for Education Indira Nair 
that the University add a new para
graph to its policy on students rights. 
The language of the proposal is de
rived from conservative activist David 
Horowitzs so-called Academic Bill of 
Rights, which the American Association 
of University Professors has called im
proper and dangerous.
Secondly, Pham told Student Senate 
on Thursday that his committee was 
also planning to address professional 
conduct on the part of professors.
Together, the Academic Affairs 
Committees two-step initiative  the 
proposed amendment to University 
policy and an eventual movement to 
address professors conduct  has the 
potential to significantly undermine the 
academic freedom of our professors and 
diminish the integrity of our education.
Phams proposed addition to the 
Universitys policy on students rights is 
based on a principle that is of the utmost 
importance to all students: we should
all, without question, have protection 
against prejudiced or arbitrary evalua
tion.
But, in fact, we already have that 
protection. Present University policy 
states: It is imperative that grading be 
a fair, accurate and honest measure of 
a students work, and the policy allows 
students to appeal grading to their pro
fessor, department head, and College 
Council, college-specific academic deci
sion-making body.
If the Academic Affairs Committee 
were concerned about bias in grad
ing, a more effective approach would 
be a campaign to make students aware 
of their existing rights and remedies. 
Adding another policy to the handbook, 
which they have admitted nobody reads, 
would be fruitless.
The second portion of what the 
Academic Affairs Committee proposes 
to do is much more ominous. The com
mittee members were vague about how 
they plan to address professional con
duct on the part of professors, but they 
cautioned, We just want to be very 
careful of stepping on facultys toes with 
certain things because they might get 
touchy and think that were restrict
ing their ability to run classes like they 
want to.
If the committee is afraid that profes
sors might think they are losing control 
of their classes, something is awry.
The integrity of our educational en
vironment rests on mutual respect and 
trust between the faculty and the stu
dents. We entrust our faculty with the 
responsibility of using their experience 
and education to set the standards of 
scholarship and teaching.
If a student feels that a professor 
conducts him- or herself in an 
unprofessional or prejudiced manner, 
that student needs to speak up. Directly 
or with the help of an advisor or friend, 
that student should address the pro
fessor, department head, or College 
Council. That sort of direct, honest com
munication is the way to resolve any 
problem of this nature, not by jeopardiz
ing academic freedom by placing policybased mandates on professors.
At no time should these issues involve 
a potentially political University admin
istration  or worse yet, as the author of 
the Academic Bill of Rights would have 
it, the courts.
Pham asserts that he wants to divorce 
his initiative from the broader political 
controversy, but, like it or not, this issue 
comes with baggage.
In the end, addressing the issue within 
the University is infinitely superior to 
partisan legislative bodies setting the 
rules for us, but the Academic Affairs 
Committees tactics still have far more 
potential for harm than for good. The 
Committee should rethink its approach.
U.S. can learn from Germanys new chancellor
General elections mostly deadlocked, 
the ruling party was rapidly losing power 
and heading straight for a complete stale
mate. Chaos seemed inevitable, until the 
improbable happened.
This was the situation in Germany 
last month, after Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroders power base eroded and 
he called for elections to shore up his 
ranks.
The big surprise? After a huge dead
lock, the two major parties decided to 
work together. They agreed to have a 
split cabinet and a new chancellor. A 
corollary surprise? The new chancellor 
is a woman.
Perhaps the only word suitable to de
scribe Angela Merkel is improbable. 
Born in 1954 to a Lutheran pastor in 
Communist East Germany, she turned to 
politics after the fall of. the Berlin Wall. 
Former chancellor Helmut Kohl put her 
in a cabinet-level position in 1994.
After the 1998 ousting of Kohls 
government, she carefully distanced
herself and ended up in control of the 
conservative Christian Democratic Union 
(CDU). Another improbable feat for the 
Protestant Merkel, considering Catholic 
men from the southwestern parts of the 
country form the CDUs traditional base 
of support.
In the September 18 elections, 
neither Merkels CDU nor Schroders 
Social Democratic Party (SPD) won a 
majority for their traditional coalitions 
in the Bundestag; only by creating a 
grand coalition of the two parties and 
negotiating serious compromise did the 
election finish.
As a politician, Merkel is hard not to 
like. Her moderate views bridge party 
affiliations. She is able to make hard 
and even biting evaluations of situations 
without alienating people. She supports 
stronger ties with the U.S. whi^. still 
quick to point out the failures of the 
Bush government.
Really, the fact that Germany would 
elect a woman chancellor shouldnt come
as a surprise to anybody. It is refreshing, 
perhaps, but unsurprising; many have 
been quick to draw parallels with the 
United Kingdoms Thatcher government 
of over 20 years ago.
The real point has nothing to do with 
gender equality or having another female 
head of state. The Grand Coalition 
formed by the political parties is the 
greater example here. What would hap
pen if the Republicans and Democrats 
got together like the CDU and SPD? A 
government more interested in getting 
things done, perhaps?
This points to the relative merit of a 
parliamentary system with multiple true 
parties. The cooperation in Germany 
is necessitated by the existence of five 
major political parties and a Chancellor 
elected by the Bundestag itself instead 
of by the people. Unlike the United 
States, with its rigid bicameral set-up, 
Germanys parliamentary system allows 
opportunities for genuine compromise 
rather than unending antagonism.
Israels pullout from 
Gaza is a charade
Construction of giant wall a device 
for further Palestinian oppression
Hanadie Yousef
Do you actually believe that Israel 
wants peace? Do you sincerely believe 
that Israel is taking actions to pave the 
road toward good relations with the 
Palestinians? Well, think again.
Israel still controls all borders, 
coastlines, and airspace in Gaza. 1.3 
million Palestinians are mewed up 
in the worlds most crowded ghetto, 
called the Gaza Strip, and practically 
nothing has changed since the disen
gagement, except that when Israeli 
soldiers perform raids in Gaza they 
are less careful as to where they point 
their guns. In fact, Israeli jetfighters, 
mainly F-16s made in the USA, con
tinue to strike many areas in the re
cently-evacuated Gaza strip, in which 
several Palestinians have been killed, 
dozens others wounded, severe dam
ages inflicted to buildings, and lets not
ders for new settlements on Palestinian 
territory; the theft never ends.
I have yet to state the worst. Israel 
is building a wall, twice as large as the 
Berlin Wall, on Palestinian territory, yet 
another reason to doubt the sincerity of 
Israels latest peace initiative.
The wall is lined with guard towers 
manned by Israeli soldiers. More than 
90 miles of it have already been com
pleted, with a lot more to go. The 
wall is just another way of annexing 
more Palestinian land and imprisoning 
Palestinians in ghettos.
I was personally forced to experi
ence the hardship of the wall when 
Israeli soldiers at an entrance did not 
allow my aunt and I and many other 
Palestinians to enter Jerusalem to pray 
at the third holiest Muslim site in the 
world, the Dome of the Rock, situ
ated within. Just like the settlements, 
this wall has been deemed illegal by 
the international community. But does 
Israel care? Why should it, when it has 
the indiscriminate support of the stronWhat more does Israel want? 
Palestinians are so poor, their 
children are starving, and Israel 
is stealing the little land they 
have left.
forget to mention the terror inflicted 
upon the innocent.
Financially and strategically, it only 
made sense for the Israeli government 
to remove its settlers from Gaza; it 
had nothing to do with care for the 
Palestinians. The international press 
Israel is now receiving for such a he
roic act allows Israel to continue op
pressing Palestinians behind this illu
sory curtain.
Do you still believe Israel wants 
peace? Why, then, did Ariel Sharons 
advisor, Dov Weisglass, state in a
2004 interview with Israels news
paper Haaretz, The disengagement is 
actually formaldehyde. It supplies the 
amount of formaldehyde thats neces
sary so that there will not be a political 
process with the Palestinians, and that 
this enables Israel to park conveniently 
in an interim situation that distances us 
as far as possible from political pres
sure?
Today, more than 500,000 Israeli 
citizens are living illegally in the 
West Bank among over 2.4 million 
Palestinians. When I say illegally, 
I mean that under international law 
these settlers are not legally allowed 
to be living in the disputed Palestinian 
territory.
Israel pretends to want to freeze the 
building of settlements; in other words, 
to stop stealing Palestinian territory. 
They even claim to want to reverse the 
trend. But actions speak louder than 
words. On March 21, 2005,'Israel ap
proved plans to build 3500 new housing 
units between the Jewish settlements of 
Maale Adumim and Jerusalem. These 
new settlements will cut the West Bank 
in half and strengthen Israels grip on 
Jerusalem, and they are already un
der construction. Since January of this 
year, Israel has issued nearly 200 ten
gest, most wealthy democratic nation 
in the world?
Israel is suffocating the Palestinians. 
There are numerous checkpoints in 
Palestinian territory that prevent travel 
from one town to another. The wall 
is being constructed on Palestinian 
farmland, and is further preventing 
the practically nonexistent export of 
Palestinian goods. Fifty percent of 
Palestinians are jobless  a direct restlt 
of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and 
Gazas perpetual state of oppression. 
Much of the income Palestinians now 
receive comes from jobs in Israel.
Even this is soon to change; Israel 
has announced a goal of eliminating 
the employment of Palestinians on its 
territory by 2008. After all, why does 
Israel need cheap Palestinian labor 
when now it can get cheap labor from 
the influx of Russian immigrant^? The 
systematic economic destruction Israel 
has wreaked on the Palestinians for 
more than 38 years continues. What 
more does Israel want? Palestinians 
are so poor, their children are starving, 
and Israel is stealing the little land they 
have left.
Israel is a state whose foundations are 
based on the terrorizing of the people 
whose land they stole: the Palestinians. 
Do you want to learn more about the 
truth of the Israel-Palestine conflict? 
The Palestinian Film Series is coming 
to Pittsburgh on October 21. There will 
be two films shown on campus, October 
23 and 30 at 7:30 pm in Porter Hall 
100. Come reeducate yourself about 
the truth.

Upcoming 
changes to 
campus
Prior to explaining more of what 
I am working on and how those 
changes will affect the campus, 
I would like to give the student 
body an update on the project 
being installed between Doherty 
and Baker Halls. The sculpture, 
designed by Jonathan Borofsky 
and donated by a trustee, is four 
sotries high. It should be an excit
ing addition to this campus.
In addition, the third floor of 
the University Center is about to 
undergo a few major changes. 
The lounge space by the stairs to 
Skibo Coffeehouse will be shrunk 
in order to build two new of
fices to house organizations that 
are currently in the Old Student 
Center, which will be demolished 
for the construction of the Gates 
Building. Unfortunately, these 
two new offices will cause a loss 
of meeting space for a few stu
dent organizations; thus Nicolette 
and I are currently working with 
the Office of Student Activities to 
find a replacement area for these 
meetings. We hope to have some
thing finalized in the next week 
or so.
I am setting up Student 
Government Executive Committee 
meetings to occur at least once 
a month. Attending these meet
ings will be the presidents of 
the Graduate Student Assembly, 
Greek Council, and the Student 
Dormitory Council, and the chairs 
of the Undergraduate Student 
Senate and Activities Board. I con
sider them to be extremely knowl
edgeable in their positions, and 
will be able to share with the other 
governing bodies what each orga
nization is working on, ultimately 
resulting in a student government 
that wont overlap in tasks. If 
you feel there is an organization 
that I have left off of my list for 
these meetings, please send me 
an e-mail.
Along those same lines 
Nicolette and I are going to start
up Presidential Roundtable din
ners. These meetings will involve 
eight to ten student organization 
leaders as well as Nicolette and 
me. Some of the meetings will 
involve leaders who lead similar 
groups, like athletic groups or 
cultural groups, so we can hear 
problems that are specific to each 
demographic, but other meetings 
will involve unrelated leaders so 
we can discuss issues facing the 
campus. I am looking forward to 
starting these to ensure various 
opinions are heard before student 
government attempts to change or 
create a policy.
These two new meetings will 
allow for a freer, more open ex
change of information, which will 
ensure student government is 
working to its fullest potential and 
considering many diverse view
points.

Pitch Black II: Pepsis market research travesty
Islamic fundamentalism is the new Communism
___________Beniamin Hackett
How nice to see you again, 
Mr. Bolshevik. It has certainly 
been a while. You have changed 
so much; I wonder if anyone will 
even recognize you anymore. 
Whats that, Mr. Bolshevik? You 
traded the hammer and sickle 
for a Quran? The people might 
not realize your return yet, but 
the vigilant surely do.
Islamic fundamentalism is the 
new Communism.
Wars over ideological strug
gles are exceedingly difficult to 
sell. Think of the difficulty with 
the initial engagement and lim
ited war policy with the Soviet 
Union in the onset and middle 
stages of the Cold War. Meeting 
Communism wherever it stood 
was a tough line to toe in tradi
tionally isolationist America. As 
such, third party and clandes
tine actions became a bailiwick 
of American foreign policy. 
States were propped up based 
on the principles of Soviet con
tainment. The CIA sponsored 
actions in Iran and Guatemala, 
both ending in coups of the gov
ernments there.
Later, as stronger leaders engaged the American people, our 
policies became more clearly 
defined. Americas stance on 
meeting the Communist chal
lenge, on whatever continent it 
cropped up, was unambiguous. 
Nuclear proliferation added a 
heavy cost to the equation of 
peace through deterrence. 
International relations became 
more complex as the United 
States and the Soviet Union de
cided that there could still be 
adequate deterrence, without 
costs remaining as high.
Eventually, when the roles of 
the two great powers became 
muddled and relations began to 
warm, the Soviet bloc began to 
unravel. In 1991, when the Cold 
War ended with the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, the world be
came a more dangerous place.
Under the impressive shadow 
of the Cold War, then, the mod
ern Islamic fundamentalist 
movement was formed and cast. 
Islamic fundamentalists are en
gaged in a war with any and ^11 
secular states. These extremists 
believe that secular state laws 
should be replaced with the laws 
of the Quran and Hadith (tradi
tions stemming from the words 
of the prophet Muhammad). 
The Islamic fundamentalist posi
tion states that the moral issues
and injustices in international 
affairs arise from the secular 
state lands.
The intent of Islamic 
fundamentalists is to create a 
theocratic empire encompassing 
the globe. The United States is 
the Wests last and only chance 
against the spread of Islamic 
fundamentalist governments. 
Here, however, is the rub: The 
liberal policies of the West are 
facilitating its own downfall.
Take the case of Europe, 
where there is a growing sect 
of fundamentalist Islam. Along 
with the declining birthrate of 
indigenous people, Islamic fun
damentalism spreads amongst 
European citizens themselves. 
When there is fundamental
ism growing from within, and 
it becomes combined with an 
increasing liberalization of poli
cies making it nearly impossible 
to shine light on extremist be
haviors, one can see how the ta
ble is being set for the transition 
of Europe into Eurabia.
Europes fall would pose a new 
set of security challenges to the 
United States. As wrongheaded 
as the European Union can be, 
one should never forget that 
Europe is a true Western ally.
Just as it was in the Cold War, 
building Europe is important in
todays struggle against Islamic 
fundamentalism.
This is the defining issue of 
our time. This struggle cannot 
be fought with the blunt instru
ments of the 70s and 80s. Our 
tools are dated; our strategy 
needs to change. We no longer 
need a strong nuclear arsenal. 
Today we need Arabic transla
tors, dedicated international 
scholars, and men who do not 
cower at the pressures of politi
cal correctness burdened onto 
them by the Media Party and 
career liberals.
There are those who are un
willing to accept the conflict 
between the West and Islamic 
fundamentalists as the most 
important issue of our day. 
Some will tell you that 
globalization, economic ex
pansion, and addressing inter
national inequalities are more 
important. To this end, the 
simple retort is an intellectually 
' honest account of an increasingly 
plausible scenario.
If the Islamic fundamental
ist movement is successful in its 
expansion, international norms 
will change. International con
cern about human rights and 
economic development of the 
third world is a luxury afforded 
to the world, paid for by the
Western powers. These perva
sive democratic concepts are re
wards for the successful policies 
that have facilitated the develop
ment of the First World nations. 
If the world order changes to 
incorporate a great power rooted 
in Islamic fundamentalism, 
the only issues will be security 
issues.
It is high time that Western 
scholars stop shying away from 
the idea of a clash of civiliza
tions. The battle against the ex
pansion of Islamic fundamental
ism is the ideological struggle 
of our time. The topic must be 
candidly discussed in order to 
be understood. One must not 
succumb to the pressures of po
litical correctness. An honest 
telling of international affairs 
should not be seen as racist 
or hatemongering. Today, 
this accurate depiction of inter
national affairs is the only hope 
for the preservation of Western 
civilization. The greatest civi
lization ever created must not 
cannibalize itself over a fear of 
the truth.

With Halloween a mere two weeks away, many people are busy planning the perfect witty costume. For those of you in need of inspiration, we asked:
Whats the most imaginative Halloween costume youve ever seen?
Evan Sundwick
Im a consumer whore. I wont 
argue with that. Ill buy pretty 
much anything if its shiny, ex
treme, new, or improved. I have 
severe gadget lust and I gobble 
down energy drinks like a good 
consumer should. I even bought 
more than fifty dollars worth of 
Mountain Dew and Pepsi in the 
hope that Id win an Xbox 360 in 
their giveaway.
But even I have limits. Re
cently, Pepsi released a limitededitiori offshoot of Mountain 
Dew called Pitch Black II. Yes, 
its a sequel. Last year saw the 
short-lived release of Mountain 
Dew Pitch Black, a grape-flavored variant of the venerable 
ambiguously citrus, caffeinepacked yellow soda.
Pitch Black tasted like an 
unholy alliance of grape soda 
and Dew that should never 
have graced the Earth. It tasted 
like someone had spiked the 
Mountain Dew supply vats with 
Dimetapp. The soda was off the 
market in a few months and no 
one really said anything. Moun
tain Dew Pitch Black went out 
with a whimper  a mediocre, 
grape-flavored whimper.
I thought I had heard the 
end of this lackluster Dew. I 
was wrong. When Star Wars 
Episode III came out in May, 
7-Eleven launched the Darth 
Dew Slurpee, a purple slurpee 
based on Pitch Black. Not only 
was this a lame tie-in to start 
with, but it tasted even worse 
than the soda itself. Imagine 
sucking cough medicine mixed 
With slightly bitter slush through 
a straw and youd have a pretty 
good idea what we were dealing 
with.
The madness doesnt stop 
there, though. Oh, no. Not 
satisfied with one relatively un
popular grape beverage, Pepsi 
decided to continue the story.
Pitch Black II, which hit stores 
in late August, reformulated the 
soda with a sour bite, a fact it 
proudly proclaims on the drinks 
gaudy metallic foil packaging.
According to Pepsis market 
research: Sour flavors are big 
right now with teens and young 
adults, so we added a sour bite 
to Mountain Dew Pitch Black II. 
Sour flavors are big right now? 
What does that even mean!? Its 
not like people are actively seek
ing out food products with sour 
tastes. Sure, I mean, everybody 
loves Sour Patch Kids and green 
apples. But beyond that, are we 
really eating anything abnor
mally sour?
Clearly something is wrong in 
Pepsis Mountain Dew marketing 
arm. On one hand, the brand has 
been marketing itself to the ex
treme youth demographic for 
ages  first with extreme sports 
like skateboarding, and now by 
associating themselves strongly 
with gaming, especially Micro
softs Xbox (made easier by the 
nuclear green color scheme that 
the products share).
On the other hand, Mountain 
Dew keeps hemorrhaging off 
these alternate flavors, some of 
which have very little to do with 
the original Dew. Code Red was 
introduced a few years ago and 
has actually managed to stay 
on the market since then. Live 
Wire, an orange Dew variant, 
comes back every summer but 
then vanishes off the face of 
the Earth when September rolls 
around. And now we have Pitch 
Black, which has shorn off al
most all of its Mountain Dew 
roots and is just an odd, almost 
black, grape soda.
It would be one thing if these 
limited editions were at least 
worth drinking, but in the case 
of Pitch Black II its just not fun 
to drink. It makes your mouth 
feel weird. It tastes like a grape 
Jolly Rancher had a baby with 
rotten Skittles and bathed it 
in carbonic acid. I didnt even 
think Skittles could get rotten,
A PERSONS OPINION

Alejo Grigera/Assistant Art Editor
Eww, this is disgusting! What foul corporate demons assaulted my palate with this odious beverage?
but apparently Mountain Dew 
found a way. Its really quite 
mind-boggling, when you think 
about it.
Pitch Black II isnt really re
freshing. It seems like the en
tire drink has no purpose other 
than a publicity stunt, but that 
would be crazy, right? I mean, 
who has ever heard of a huge 
international corporation pull
ing publicity stunts for the hell 
of it?
Please, Mountain Dew. Stop 
the insanity. We dont need a 
hojillion different limited edition 
variations. Plain old yellow is 
just fine. Its not like there are 
people collecting each drink and 
painstakingly preserving their 
limited-run Code Live Black 17 
Mountain Dew Extreme Edition.
Its a freaking soda. Theyre a 
dollar. Get over yourselves.

Mens soccer wins tough 
match at home vs. NYU
Senior midfielder Sean Filipowitz steals the ball from two Brandeis players Friday night at Gesling Stadium.Justin Brown/Photo Staff

Sports Editor
Two quick goals proved to be 
the difference for the mens soccer 
team Sunday as they defeated 
the New York University Violets
2-1 at Gesling Stadium. On a 
sunny autumn day, the Tartans 
used two goals in the first ten 
minutes of the game to improve 
their UAA conference record to
3-1 on the season.
The team got on the board in 
. the fourth minute of play when 
a header by junior midfielder 
William Schlough found the back 
of the Violets net. The header 
came off a corner kick by Friday 
nights hero Dan Mastalski, who 
was credited for the assist.
The Tartans offense struck 
again just minutes later. Schlough 
put a header to a streaking 
Andrew Park, who controlled the 
ball as he ran past NYU defenders 
and beat goalie Chris Wright with 
a shot to the left side of the net. 
The tally was Parks fourth goal of 
the season.
The Carnegie Mellon defense 
held tough for most of the game 
to secure the lead, as the Violets 
were able to get deep in Tartan
territory throughout the game.
NYU finally got on the board 
with 12 minutes to play to cut 
the lead to one. First-year goalie 
Matthew Bazin deflected a long 
shot from an NYU midfielder, but 
in the scramble for the rebound 
Violets forward Zyad Qamer put 
the loose ball in the net.
However, this would be Bazins 
only mistake of the night, as the 
Tartans held off the Violets in 
the last ten minutes to secure the 
win. The first-year keeper had 
several key saves; Bazin recorded 
seven saves on the night to lead 
Carnegie Mellon. defensively. 
Overall, the Violets outshot the 
home team 8-6, a stat that shows 
Bazins effectiveness in the net for 
the team.
The win ends a run of three 
games in which the Tartans have 
defeated the teams at the bottom 
of the UAA standings: NYU, 
Brandeis, and Washington. They 
will have two non-conference 
tilts at home against Grove City 
and Westminster Colleges before 
finishing up their conference 
schedule on the road. The Tartans 
face division leaders Rochester, 
along with Emory and Case 
Western Reserve to finish up the 
regular season.
XC teams run well at Waynesburg
by Andrew Clearfield
Assistant Sports Editor
In their last tune-up before the 
conference championships, the 
Carnegie Mellon mens cross
country team sat their top five 
runners and still finished second 
at the Waynesburg College 
Invitational Saturday afternoon.
Sophomore runner Jason Jura 
led the Tartans with an 11thplace finish on a day that was so 
windy that the runners uniforms 
flapped wildly and it was a 
struggle just to maintain straight 
running lanes.
The wind was incredible, and 
the ground was uneven; it was 
almost hard to stay upright, said 
Jura. It was very unusual to run 
in those conditions. Sophomore 
Doug Fricker, who finished 23rd 
in the race, added, It was a 
flat course, so the times were 
supposed to be low, but running 
in that kind of wind I think we did 
well to finish where we did.
Besides serving as final 
preparation for the UAA
championships, Saturdays race 
also was important because it is 
the location of next years regional 
course. As a result, none of CMUs 
senior runners ran, giving the 
younger Tartans the opportunity 
to memorize the various turns 
and slopes of the course for next 
years important race.
It was a great chance to get 
acquainted with the course since 
it will be the region course for 
next year, said Junga. We know 
what to expect now with the fast 
times and the uneven ground, so 
that should help.
The womens team also fared 
well in their last tune-up before 
the championship season. The 
team placed sixth of 13 squads 
despite not having senior captain 
Jocelyn Sikorarun.
The Tartans were led by firstyear Rachel Perry, who placed 
19th overall and first on the team. 
She completed the less than four 
mile course in 27:04, a pace of 
7:16 per mile, to set the pace for 
her teammates.
Behind her, seniors Kate 
Hollabaugh and Kim Kicielenski
CLUBSPORTS
Mens Lacrosse
The Carnegie Mellon mens la
crosse team announced this week 
that they have been accepted to 
the USL-MDIA B League for the 
2006 spring season. The jump 
to the more competitive league 
was enabled by the hire of head 
coach Anthony Stamatopoulos, 
and assistant coaches Rich Grant 
and Greg Edelman, and a more 
serious work ethic shown by team 
members.
With this, the team will shift to 
a virtual varsity schedule, where 
the club will practice on a near
varsity level in order to compete 
in the USLIA. This includes daily 
practices and weekly games 
against division opponents.
The team will play in the Cen
tral Collegiate Lacrosse Associ
ations B South division begin
ning in March. The new league 
features familiar rivals Grove 
City College and Indiana Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and also 
new opponents in the Univer
sity of Dayton, Taylor Univer
sity (Ind.), and the University of 
Michigan-Dearborn. Carnegie 
Mellon will also play three non
league opponents in the course
placed 30th and 32nd, just four 
seconds apart in 28:26 and 
28:30. Sophomore Erin Gagnon 
placed 40th and first-year Leigh 
Fortenberry rounded out the 
scoring for the Tartans, placing 
56th overall.
Carnegie Mellon hosts the UAA 
championships in two weeks on 
October 29, and the race will 
be held on the hills of Schenley 
Park. The mens team finished 
third at this event each of the 
last two years. This years team, 
though, has run better than any in 
recent CMU history, and Fricker 
at least believes they have the 
ability to finish at the top of the 
conference.
Weve run as well as all of the 
teams that will be there so far, 
he said. I think finishing first or 
second is very realistic. We know 
the course, and we have a lot of 
good runners, so this is the year 
to do it.
The women also look to improve 
on last years finish and overcome 
the loss of senior Drea Garvue, 
the teams number-two runner, 
who is studying abroad.
of the season to create a regular 
season with a minimum of eight 
games.
The team will begin their fall 
game schedule next weekend 
when they travel to West Virginia 
University for their fall tourna
ment, where they will compete 
with MDIA A teams such as the 
University of Pittsburgh and West 
Virginia University.
Interested players should con
tact head coach Anthony Stama
topoulos (astamatopoulos@

LaFave (psl06@cmu.edu) if they 
want to play for the team.

Football loses division opener
FOOTBALL, from A12
Tartans in rushing yards and 
touchdowns, was held to a mere 
10 yards rushing.
The Tartans fared no better in 
the second half on either side of 
the ball. The offense remained 
unable to sustain drives and the 
Maroons offense appeared to be 
gaining yards at will against the 
Tartan defense.
Perhaps nothing epitomized 
the Tartans play more than a 
series late in the second quarter. 
The Tartan defense had forced 
Chicago to punt deep in their
own territory. The snap on the 
punt was fumbled by Chicago, 
and as a result the Tartans got 
the ball in scoring position on 
the Chicago 22-yard line.
The next four plays for the 
Tartans were a holding penalty, 
a rush for no gain, and two 
consecutive sacks by Chicago 
resulting in a net 21-yard loss. 
Simply put, regardless of what 
the Tartans tried, nothing would 
go their way.
The Tartans ended the game 
gaining 146 yards of offense. 
Their running game, which has 
been their primary offensive
strength, was held in check by 
the Chicago defense and limited 
to 59 yards on 31 attempts. 
Sivek scored the Tartans only 
touchdown late in the third 
quarter, but the extra point 
attempt was blocked.
The defense, which has been 
the teams strength this sea
son, could not figure out 
how to stop Chicago, which 
moved the ball well on the 
ground and through the air. 
Ultimately, Chicago netted 
469 yards on offense, with over 
300 yards and all five touch
downs coming through the air.

Sophomore Amy Staloch won the ITA Small College 
Division III Championship at in Fort Myers, Fla., 
on Saturday. Staloch battled her way through the 
tournament, defeating opponents to reach the finals 
of the prestigious tournament.
A 6-4, 6-4 victory over top-seeded Jeannine Liang 
from Claremont-Mudd-Scripps College secured the 
Tartans number one singles player a spot in the 
finals. Rising early for an 8:30 am match, she met 
familiar rival Serena Burkhard of Emory University. 
Burkhard appeared to have the upper hand as she 
took the first set 6-2, but Staloch would not roll 
over and give the match away. Behind strong serves 
and aggressive play at the net, Staloch battled back 
from the brink of defeat to force a third set with a
7-6 win after taking a 7-3 tiebreaker. The match came 
down to another tiebreaker in the last set, as Staloch 
outlasted Burkhard 9-7 to claim the championship.
Obviously it is huge for our program, it shows that 
were moving in the right direction to compete for 
national t itles, said coach Andy Girard, who has been 
Stalochs coach since her arrival at Carnegie Mellon.
She has just matured a lot on the court  last 
year when she got behind shed tend to get frustrated 
and angry  now she just digs in and gets ready to 
battle.
Aside from winning the Division III title, Staloch also 
received the James OHara Sargent Sportsmanship 
Award. This award goes to a mens and womens 
player who displays outstanding sportsmanship and 
exemplify the spirit of college tennis.
Staloch will look to carry this success into Carnegie 
Mellons regular season, where she will lead the team 
in the quest for a UAA title.

Football loses UAA game at ChicagoMens soccer squeaks past Brandeis
by Kevin LaBuz
Staffwriter
A week after trouncing 
Colorado College, the Tartans 
(3-3) experienced a trouncing of 
their own when they took on the 
University of Chicago Maroons 
(2-4) on Saturday. The Tartans 
35-6 loss was particularly costly 
as it came during their first con
ference game.
Both teams entered Saturdays 
contest coming off of large 
victories last week  the Tartans 
trumping Colorado College 
63-26 and the Maroons shutting 
out Washington University 
27-0. The Maroons however, 
would prove to be a much more 
formidable foe than Colorado.
We will be tested on both 
sides of the ball this week against 
Chicago. They are a much better 
team than Colorado, said Tartan 
head coach Rich Lackner. Well 
see where we stand on a team 
on Saturday, he continued. 
Hopefully Saturdays blowout 
loss at the hands of the Maroons 
was a poor indication of where
the team is standing.
The Maroons started the game 
with the ball and on their first 
possession were able to drive 
75 yards for a touchdown. The 
Tartans special teams were able 
to block the point-after attempt, 
giving Chicago a six-point lead.
The Tartans returned the 
kickoff to their 27-yard line, but 
their offense was not able to 
sustain a drive and they were 
quickly forced to punt. Once 
again, Chicago was able to move 
the ball with ease against the 
Tartans defense, picking up three 
first downs in three plays and 
putting them in scoring position. 
The Tartans defense stiffened up 
in the red zone, though, forcing 
Chicago to attempt a 37-yard field 
goal which missed wide right due 
to strong winds.
On the ensuing possession, 
the Tartans established a drive, 
picking up two first downs on a 
scramble by senior quarterback 
Jarrod Highberger and a pass 
from Highberger to junior wide 
receiver Mark Davis. The drive 
ended abrupdy, though, several 
plays later, when a pass intended
for sophomore halfback Robert 
Gimson was intercepted by 
Chicago sophomore linebacker 
Tony Insalaco. To make matters 
worse, the Tartans were flagged 
for a personal foul on the play, 
giving Chicago an extra 15 yards.
Throughout the first half, 
and throughout the game, 
the Tartans were plagued by 
myriad errors, such as fumbles, 
penalties, and interceptions, all 
of which prevented their offense 
from establishing any sort of 
consistency. Chicago, behind 
a well-balanced offense that 
effectively employed both the run 
and the pass, was able to move 
the ball well and entered halftime 
leading the game 14-0.
While the Maroons were able 
to move the ball fluidly, the 
Tartan offense was virtually 
nonexistent. At halftime the 
Tartans had managed only 
58 yards of net offense. A telling 
statistic, and a testament to the 
play of Chicagos defense, is that 
at halftime sophomore fullback 
Travis Sivek, who leads the

the offensive pressure, Brandeis 
still had opportunities, the closest 
coming 70 minutes into the game 
on a crossing shot. However, 
first-year keeper Matthew Bazin 
made a spectacular diving onehanded save, tapping the ball out 
of bounds, before it could sail in 
to right side of the goal.
Hope shined anew for the 
Tartans when, with 17 minutes 
left in the second half,.Brandeis 
keeper Matt Kaplan fouled Tartan 
junior forward Andy Park on a 
breakaway. The foul resulted 
in a direct kick just outside 
the box. Fans and players held 
their breaths in anticipation as 
number 21, senior Dan Mastalski, 
set up to take the kick for the 
Tartans. Suddenly, the crowd 
let out a cry of ecstatic joy and 
excitement as Mastalski put the 
ball past Kaplan, bringing the 
Tartans to a 1-0 lead. This goal 
would prove to be the difference 
maker, as the Carnegie Mellon 
defense held tight to preserve 
a 1-0 victory. Coupled with a 
2-1 win against NYU Sunday, the 
team improved to 3-1 in league 
play and 9-1-1 overall.

Only an hour after the men 
celebrated a 1-0 win, the lights 
shone through the night on the 
head's of the Carnegie Mellon 
womens soccer team at Gesling 
Stadium on Friday. The Tartan 
women got ready for the kickoff, 
preparing to play Brandeis in 
their third UAA game for the 
season. The 18th-ranked women 
took the field and came away 
with a 2-0 shutout on a brisk 
autumn night.
The Tartans used their 
excellent footwork and ballhandling skills to create space 
and connect passes. The two 
teams were very evenly matched, 
and in the first half, each had 
several shot attempts.
But the game was kept close 
by great goalkeeping on both 
ends. Towards the end of the first 
half the Tartans had a scoring 
opportunity, but Brandeis goal 
keeper Betsey Medow tapped 
Kristin Bevilacquas shot up 
over the crossbar for a save. 
The Tartans kept the offensive 
pressure up and continued to fire
shots, making the Judges defense 
work to keep the tie.
With 7:17 left in the first half, 
CMU first-year Abigail Coffin, 
who had just been inserted into 
the lineup, headed a corner 
kick from sophomore defender 
Amanda Rose into the right 
corner of the net. This scored 
the first goal of the game, in a 
position where Medow never had 
a chance to save it.
Coffin scored again with 
4:03 left in the first half, as she 
dribbled into space and fired 
a shot off of her left foot from 
20 yards out. Medow reached 
out to save it, but the ball 
just squeezed through her 
outstretched hand and the right 
post, putting more points on the 
board for the Tartans.
This was Coffins ninth 
goal for the season, and 
it brought the Tartans a 
2-0 lead. At this point, it was 
evident that the Tartans were 
headed for another win.
At halftime, the Tartans 
remained motivated and tried 
to stay moving due to dropping 
temperatures. Fans, bundled 
up and huddled close, stayed to 
cheer the team despite the cold.
Brandeis, went up for a header 
off a Carnegie Mellon throw-in 
and collided with a CMU player. 
Zackaroff had to be attended off 
the field, but the game continued, 
depleting the Judges backline.
The remainder of the first half 
was fast-paced and the energy 
was consistent. Brandeis playing 
style was energetic and somewhat 
haphazard, while the Tartans 
connected more passes and kept 
the frenzied and vocal Judges at 
bay. With a little over six minutes 
left in the first half, the Tartans 
had a close call defensively. 
The Judges played it short off 
a corner kick, and went for a 
quick give-and-go pass, giving 
them the opportunity for a shot 
to the1 lower left corner. Luckily, 
the shot went wide, and the first 
half closed scoreless.
The second half of the game was 
equally intense. Whistles blew, 
bodies flew, and the yells of the 
players (mostly Brandeis players) 
and fans alike echoed across the 
field. The Tartans dominated the 
second half, having the ball down 
on the Judges end of the field for 
the majority of the period. Despite
At the whistle, the second 
half began. The Tartan women 
tightened their defense but still 
found considerable scoring 
opportunities. The Tartans had 
eight shots on goal for the second 
period and overall outshot the 
Judges 20-8. In the meantime, 
the Tartans held together and 
discouraged the Judges offense 
defensively.
First-year goalie Christie 
Adams recorded three saves in 
the second half for the Tartans 
tenth shutout for the season.
However, Adams displayed the 
skills she has shown all year, 
making difficult saves look easy.
Despite suffering a broken wrist 
and needing surgery earlier in 
the year, she has been in full form 
for each game since then.
With the win, the Tartans 
improve to 9-0-2 for the 
season, and hope to improve 
their national ranking. They 
currently sit behind divisional 
foes Rochester and Chicago 
on the Division III NSCAA/
Adidas National Rankings, 
but look to move up from 
their spot at number 18. Their 
matchup with Rochester comes
on October 30 in Rochester. Sophomore forward Kasey Stever battles a Brandeis defender for possession on Friday night.

The clouds that had held steady 
all week long parted on Friday, 
just in time to shine some sun 
on the Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer game at Gesling Stadium. 
The whistle blew and the Tartans 
began play at 5:30 pm, facing a 
tough Brandeis University team. 
Through a tough defensive battle, 
Carnegie Mellon came out on top, 
edging out a 1-0 victory over the 
Judges. The win improves the 
mens team to 8-1-1 overall and 
2-1 in division play.
The Tartans started the game 
strong, getting a shot off in the 
first 20 seconds of the half. 
Although caught slightly off 
guard, Brandeis quickly recovered 
and matched their opponents 
intensity. The Judges speed and 
aggression was matched by the 
Tartans as the two teams began 
what would be a struggle to put 
points on the board. Within the 
first five minutes of the game, 
a player was already injured;

Big Als Metal Review
The boys of Byzantine prove dedicated music exists
Title: And They Shall Take Up Serpents
Artist: Byzantine
Label: Prosthetic Records
A few decades ago, before the age of high-tech 
toys, the only means of escape for a teenager 
was a pair of headphones and a well-worn 
copy of Led Zeppelin II. Back in those days, 
bands took their responsibility to audiences 
seriously, producing large-sounding albums 
that sounded awesome between your ears. 
Epic guitar solos, mythical lyrics, and bom
bastic drums led sullen teenagers on a jour
ney away from Ma and Pa and into their own 
world. It was this dedication to their fans 
that has cemented bands like Rush, Zep, 
Sabbath, Aerosmith, the Stones  well, you 
get the picture  in the hearts of fans now 
far beyond their adolescent years.
Nowadays, the common argument is that 
bands put out watered-down music thats 
safe and easily categorized by critics and in
dustry reps alike. Its an argument that holds 
true many times over. Few examples like 
Machine Head and lamb of god exist today, 
with most labels throwing their weight be
hind sure-hits instead of developing bands 
tenderly. For every Mastodon there are three 
Third Eye Blinds.
But, there is hope. Like the aforementioned 
groups, dedicated musicians still exist, 
mostly touring just to survive and play to 
aficionados across the vast heartland of this 
country. Thankfully, some of these cats made 
it over to the backwoods of 
West Virginia, inspiring the 
young upstarts who founded 
Byzantine.
And They Shall Take Up Ser
pents, an homage to their 
snake-handling Appalachian 
roots, is a complex, varied 
album. Stretching out into 
standard death metal, the 
music has tentacles that grab 
hold of elements of prog and 
NewWave of American heavy 
metal. There are structural 
odes to Virginian brothers-inarms lamb of god, no doubt. There are times 
the clean vocals remind one of Sevendust or 
Nevermore. There are times that the guitar 
solos would make Alex Liefson stop and take 
notice. The standard comparison to Pantera, 
Meshuggah, blah blah blah, is too limited 
and modern a comparison to place on this 
band. Yes, if you like those bands, you will 
like Byzantine. If you like challenging music, 
I know you will like this band.
ATSTUS is an album that is best taken as a 
whole rather than song by song. Instrumentally, they are greater than the sum of 
their parts  many talented musicians take 
a while to gel as a group. This is a credit to 
the production as well; their style and the 
influences they wear on their sleeves shine 
through tightly. Solos are placed evenly 
throughout  a lost art in my view, and 
the rhythm section provides a solid anchor 
for the guitars. As one solo takes off, bleed
ing into a mechanized grind into another 
beautiful Rush-y solo, one cant help but 
think theyre holding back, as if they could 
just pummel the listener with their techni
cal skills, but choose riot to. Perhaps the best 
way to describe this album is that it casually 
leads the listener from one point of view to 
another. Not bad for a ferocious metal band.
Just like with a good Zep album, put on a 
pair of headphones, close your eyes and lie 
back. Its worth the trip.

Breaking the Box
Kai Gutschow speaks about self-expression through architecture
As most students know, Carnegie Mellon University has 
heralded its creed as innovation with impact for years. 
Kai Gutschow of the CMU architecture department 
spoke last Tuesday on this creeds parallel in breaking 
boxes and the strong connection with advancement in 
architecture.
Gutschow has taught at Carnegie Mellon University 
since 2000, and he recently earned his Ph.D. from 
Columbia University. Coming from a humble career as 
a cabinetmaker in Hamburg, Germany, he now directs 
the second year of studies in the CMU architecture 
department. Gutschow has spent time in India, Asia, and 
Nepal, and he has used his knowledge of architectural 
design and history to become a leading scholar in his field. 
Now Gutschow lectures for organizations such as the 
Pittsburgh museums, teaches many courses at CMU, and 
furthers his research through articles and publications.
Launching a series of lectures at the Carnegie Museum of 
Art, Gutschow spoke last Tuesday on Frank Lloyd Wrights 
design techniques and their impact on the architectural 
world. The lecture focused on Wrights literal and 
metaphorical deconstruction of architectural boxes. 
Whether these boxes kept houses in bland arrangements 
or the art of building design in stagnation, Wright helped 
to break their restricting nature. Gutschow emphasized
that this not only broke precedents but erected new ones 
that affected the architectural world for decades.
In breaking with tradition, Wright set what Gutschow 
termed a trajectory for the present. Gutschow himself 
sees such a trajectory as important for architectural 
insight, and in his classroom he stresses the necessity 
of precedent. In the second year of the architecture 
program, his students learn about the importance of 
history, for in Gutschows view, people work together 
with an agreement on what has already been done. He 
tells his students that you have to know the rules before 
you can break them.
Acknowledging that not all of the architectural world 
agrees with this viewpoint, Gutschow noted, I consider 
myself first and foremost a historian. I work very hard to 
see how a building came out of its context. He and his 
colleagues argue vociferously on the idea of precedent 
and the present, and Gutschow says his strong hope is 
that his students will defend their own position with the 
constellation of ideas and theories we present to them 
with passion.
Gutschow asserts that his students enter the program 
with an. existing knowledge of buildings that they use 
daily, and this excludes a truly blank slate from the
classroom. He helps his pupils become aware of that 
knowledge pool they have and works with them to build 
upon it. When students draw connections between their 
past experiences and the topics covered in their classes, 
Gutschow says his job in teaching becomes much more 
rich and fulfilling.
As his students know, constraints are inherent in 
architecture and in Gutschows philosophy, as all art 
implies constraints placed upon the artist. They come 
in the form of 12-tone scales, painting materials, body 
flexibility, and zoning laws. Gutschow believes that for 
his chosen art, every constraint is a positive one. He 
continued, Constraints arent handcuffs. They help 
find direction and focus.... With unlimited freedom, we 
couldnt build or think.
The greatest architects find their way through 
restrictions, Gutschow added. He hopes that his students 
still find their passion for art and self-expression through 
architecture even through the fog of restrictions. He 
affirmed for his students that the sign of a true genius... 
is one who can find creativity within any constraints.

Alfred Hitchcock is seriously the 
man. The father of suspense thrillers 
directed this movie about a guy who 
offers to trade murders with a man 
he meets on a train, so that neither 
of them becomes a suspect. Things go 
horribly awry, as most Alfred Hitch
cock movies tend to do, and it ends 
with a race against time to prove one 
mans innocence and another mans 
guilt. Good black-and-white cinema is

that Pittsburgh is a naturally defensible 
city thanks to all the rivers; but its also 
a naturally delicious dty to zombies 
because of all the, you know, brains. So 
of course the zombies want in. And if 
that isnt reason enough for you to see

Gruesome stories from Guantanamo
Attorney Brent Mickum discusses his observations and work for U.S. prisoners
Specialist Sean Baker, a soldier stationed at the United 
States Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base, was dressed 
as a detainee for a practice drill one day late last year. 
The drill was supposed to train soldiers how to extract 
uncooperative prisoners; but on thjs day, the sergeant in 
charge didnt indicate it was a drill at all.
Baker, who said he was beaten and slammed against a 
steel floor before the drill was halted, was soon sent to a 
military hospital with seizures resulting from a traumatic 
brain injury. His story was reported on 60 Minutes II last 
November.
Washington lawyer Brent Mickum brought this first
hand perspective of conditions and operations at the 
U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to CMU last 
week. Mickum, who has served as the American attorney 
for three detainees held at the base, gave a two-hour 
presentation to an attentive audience. He reviewed his 
background defending the Guantanamo detainees, the 
history of the development of the U.S. detention center 
there, allegations of torture being used against prisoners, 
and the military tribunals at which prisoners are tried.
A senior partner in the law firm of Keller and Heckman, 
Mickum was only the second attorney to visit 
Guantanamo when he joined the case in March 2004. At 
the front end of this case I cant impress on you enough 
how tough it was, because when I first started the case it 
was an extraordinarily unpopular thing to be doing.... I got
a lot of hate mail, he said. Gradually, as the allegations 
of torture came out, it loosened up and my firm actually 
agreed to start paying my expenses.
The government set out to create a jail that was beyond 
the law.... They decided that if it wasnt sovereign United 
States territory they could hold [the suspects] indefinitely 
and the court had no jurisdiction. The government 
wanted a place where it would be impossible for the public 
to understand what was going on behind the screen.
The fact of the matter is they wanted a place where they 
knew they could use brutal interrogation techniques, 
Mickum went on. Guantanamo had been used before for 
[holding refugees, including] the Haitians and Jamaicans, 
so they had a kind of skeletal structure that was already 
in place.
One specific charge of torture at the naval base came 
from a report compiled in April 2004 by three British 
men who spent more than two years in U.S. custody at 
Guantanamo. When it first came out, the government 
completely denied everything that was in here, Mickum 
said, waving a copy of the report. [The prisoners] 
describe how people were being short-shackled for 18 to 
24 hours in the freezing cold or the extreme heat, and 
they also mention the use of prostitutes.
Mickum also dted the case of Mamdouh Habib, an 
Australian citizen who was detained by the U.S. in
Pakistan in October 2001, then sent to Egypt for six 
months before ending up at Guantanamo Bay. He arrived 
at Gitmo without his fingernails, bleeding from his nose 
and ears. He was bleeding from his ears because they had 
systematically put out cigarettes in his ears over about 
four months, Mickum recounted. [In Egypt] they hung 
him by his wrists above a steel metal drum, and he would 
just stand on it, and then they electrified the drum so that 
essentially he was given the choice between standing on 
the electrified drum or keeping his feet up.
Mickum explained his views on the Guantanamo 
situation in general: I fervently believe that [the case] 
is about American values; its not about politics. Its not 
about the Presidents ability to wage war anywhere in 
the world against terrorism. I think its more about the 
Presidents abilitythe executives abilityto imprison 
anyone anywhere indefinitely, and torture them, even if 
theyre innocent.
He also commented on how difficult it is for the detainees 
to defend themselves or refute charges placed against 
them at a tribunal. What we need here is some process by 
which someone has the ability in some sort of open way 
to say Tm not the guy you say I am. They deserve some 
sort of hearing at the front end to determine if theres any 
reason to hold these people.

Jonathan Safran Foer
Author of Everything is Illuminated speaks on his inspirations
Looking for an event that will merge the worlds of your 
swankified hipster friends and the upper-middle-class 
philanthropists you left in suburbia? Just venture on 
down Forbes Avenue and stop in front of that robust Wil
liam Shakespeare copper thing. Turn left, go through the 
doors, and stumble across the Drue Heinz Lectures series, 
the perfect alternative to doing homework that doesnt 
make you feel like youre wasting too much time.
Jonathan Safran Foer, author of Everything Is Illuminated, 
spoke as part of the Lectures series last Monday, just in 
time for the film adaptation of his debut novel to hit Pitts
burgh theaters. Foer spoke to an audience composed of 
two major species: ogling young aspirants who barely 
scraped together the eight bucks to go, and the benefac
tors whose names appear on the program pages no one 
reads.
Clad in jeans and a sport coat, Foer, 28, could have passed 
for a CMU student who had wandered onto stage in a 
post-midterm haze. Foers youth and success create an 
unusual couple in the literary world, but his bestseller 
status certainly wasnt immediate.
After graduating from Princeton with a degree in philoso
phy, Foer worked a string of jobs no Jewish parent would 
show off about. It wasnt until he yielded one acceptance 
and eight rejections from book publishers that Foer began 
a career of bringing Something into existence through 
his novels.
Foer read from Illuminated and his latest novel, Extremely 
Loud and Incredibly Close, for a total of about three min
utes; so his 90 minute lecture dealt mainly with Foers 
personal writing habits and approaches. The role of the 
author, he said, was to find words for things that are in us 
but dont exist yet because there arent words for them.
We cant have emotions if we dont have a word for 
them, Foer explained.
The evening was not without some political commentary 
from the literary superstar. Citing Americas actions in 
Iraq, Foer challenged, We are doing things that would 
not be possible if we were looking at them at home, cit
ing the killing of Iraqi civilians as an example. Balanc
ing these grim comments, though, were Foers frequent
witticisms. When asked during the Q&A session what he 
thought of the Illuminated film, Foer replied, Thats like 
asking a dad if he thinks his daughter looks sexy on prom 
night.
AftertheclosingQ&Around,Foersatinthemarble-drenched 
lobby and signed books that were for sale as he mingled

them to get personalized  that way, they didnt have to 
introduce themselves as the proverbial poor college writ

With nothing to accompany him but a podium and a 
bottle of Aquafina, Foer enthralled the Pittsburgh audi
ence with material that proved interesting not only for his 
fans but for all readers. If this lecture is a sign of things 
to come, we can expect both more creative masterpieces 
from Foer and more weekday nights well spent nestled 
beside Shakespeare.

The Perceptionists
Boston-based rap group delivers positive message
spoke out against the stereotypical lifestyles of many 
rappers: Im tired of being surrounded by the drugs and 
gunplay.
Although they have had extensive solo careers, Mr. 
Lif, Akrobatik, and DJ Fakts One  who was absent at
These days, it seems most rap music all too often 
deteriorates into pointless and redundant rhymes about 
guns, women, and drugs. When hip-hop group the 
Perceptionists paid a visit to CMUs Rangos Ballroom 
last Sunday, however, the topic of discussion was much 
different.
The Perceptionists, a Boston-based hip-hop group, have 
built a large fan base around their politically charged, 
socially conscious raps. With infectious flows and sincerity 
in their message, the Perceptionists were able to reach out 
to both the politically active and the more simplistic music 
lovers. With rhymes like Where are the weapons of mass 
destruction/Weve been looking for months and we aint 
found nothin/Please Mr. President tell us somethin/ 
Were beginning to begin that youve been bluffin, Mr. 
Lif and Akrobatik gained immediate acceptance from the 
politically active, anti-Bush crowd, including CMUs Matt 
Merewitz, a fifth-year senior in H&SS, who found the 
groups lyrics and political message insightful.
The Perceptionists raps promotes nonviolent solutions to 
our worlds problems: Whats the reason for the war? Im 
shooting at these people that I got no animosity for.
Make no mistake about it, the Perceptionists are not your 
average rap group. In Breathe in the Sun, Akrobatik

The Perceptionists rapped to an enthusiastic audience.
Sundays show and was replaced by an MC from the hiphop group Asimov  have only recently come together 
to form the Perceptionists. Signed to independent label 
Definitive Jux, the group recently released their first CD, 
Black Dialogue. Says the groups website: Black Dialogue 
is a naturally flowing, mind-engaging genius album, the 
culmination of a hell of a lot of work apart, but just as 
much together ... it was the right time to summon the 
good demons of rap and forge the magic onto [CD].
By the end of the show, the Perceptionists had reeled in 
an impressive number of CMU students and local hip-hop 
enthusiasts. Unlike previous concerts at Rangos, AB Tech 
closed off half of the ballroom to create a more intimate 
setting. This also created tighter, clearer acoustics. The 
rappers vocals were crisp" and the music was powerful 
in its delivery. The crowd was enthusiastic, excited, and 
interested by such a unique breed of rap music. Often 
singing along with catchy choruses and sharp political 
hooks, the crowd welcomed the Perceptionists with open 
arms.

The Go! Team, off to a good start
Already selling out concerts, this diverse band is making waves
Edge, posted October 4, the founder of The Go! Team, Ian Parton, originally wanted to meld together the elements of club 
culture with live, rock-band performance. That intent alone 
helps to explain the inspirations for and the diversities within 
the music. The Go! Teams members, along with their respective 
instrument choice, also combine to form a less standard, more 
unique set. Parton plays guitar, drums, and harmonica, with Chi 
Fukami Taylor also behind the drums, Sam Dook also playing 
guitar, Jamie Bell on bass, and final member Silke Steidinge as 
an MC Ninja and keyboardist/guitarist/drummer.
The Go! Team, a semi-multicultural band hailing from the 
United Kingdom, just recently signed on to Memphis Industries/ 
Columbia Records and debuted with Thunder, Lightning, Strike 
in the United States on October 4. They have embarked on their 
first U.S. tour, which began last Saturday in Texas, and theyve 
already sold out three shows abroad in London, Glasgow, and 
Manchester.
And for another thing, the first two song tides rhyme: Panther 
Dash and Ladyflash. Classy, I think to myself, making poems 
of your song titles. Oh, and then theres the song tide that rein
forces the imagery of the football players, Huddle Formation. 
There are also tracks whose tides just feel far too sentimental, 
Friendship Update and Everyones a V.I.P. to Someone. 
Touching, to be sure.
Review this? How many times can you rephrase Crap-on-plastic 
waste of money, or Laser-etched trash? All this before I go to 
my humble abode and actually listen to the music. Im a horrible 
person, I know. But I assembled a set of rules for myself: two 
run-throughs before I was allowed to make a judgment based 
on what counted, the music.
Give it a little time, and their popularity is sure to germinate 
in the underground music scene here in the U.S. Track three, 
Feelgood by Numbers, is a pleasantly low-key song that re
minds me of Charlie Brown. Get it Together, track five, is remi
niscent of any number of animated movies where animals romp 
through the wild. And Junior Kickstart will definitely wake 
you up in the morning.
So I hate to admit it  and my visual sensibility is kicking me 
in the eyes at the moment  but despite the ickiness of the CD 
cover, Im about to import all the songs on Thunder, Lightning, 
Strike into iTunes. Without artwork.

And, as Ive set you up to realize, its not bad. I shuddered to ad
mit it, at first, but the music is fun to listen to. I could get used 
to that, someone nearby said. That kind of sums up Thunder, 
Lightning, Strike. The Go! Team isnt meant to be blared in your 
dorm room, around your Kanye-loving roommate. (And espe
cially not when Real World: Austin is on, of course.) Its definitely 
not going to be a hit among the pop-radio demographic.A wonderful band to see live, The Go! Team have begun selling out concerts.

I admit it: I jump to conclusions. I make largely unfair assump
tions based on first appearances. Judging books by their covers? 
Lets update that adage, make it a bit more relevant to 2005: 
Dont judge a CD by its case. But Ive learned my lesson, via The 
Go! Teams newest release, Thunder, Lightning, Strike.
Their CD cover looks hand-drawn and, quite frankly, rushed 
and childish. And how about the name? The Go! Team? I pic
ture craziness slightly akin to the antics of Peelander Zee: a 
band randomly shouting or screeching, only this time about 
high school. I picture music videos of really wacky cheerleaders 
and untraditional football players.
But The Go! Team can be appreciated by the indie-dance-party 
kids, and thats who they seem to be targeting. Jackson Five 
meets The Killers (for about 30 seconds on the beginning of 
track one, Panther Dash) meets experimental meets 70s tele
vision show theme song and 80s pop. I think I detected banjos 
and pennywhistles, record scratching, and chanting (cheers?). 
Its happy music, for people patient enough to realize that its 
probably not going to make Billboards next top-20 list. Or even 
Ryan Seacrests Sunday morning countdowns.

A sad day for ballet
The Pittsburgh Ballet cuts live music for the season
j /
Emily Lee/Art Staff
Ballet-goers who went to see the Pittsburgh Ballet 
Theatres October 6 production of Carmen at the Benedum Center saw more than they bargained for that night. 
Along with the show, the audience also saw the line of 
active protestors crowded outside the theater.
Members of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre orchestra, 
as well as several student and faculty members from 
Carnegie Mellon University, protested outside the theater 
all four days of Carmens performance run. After enter
ing the theater, audience members probably noticed 
something unusual: The orchestra was not inside the 
Benedum Center, performing in the pit as it would nor
mally. Instead, the orchestra members were the ones out
side holding signs such as Live ballet needs live music.
The Pittsburgh Ballet announced on August 1 that the 
orchestra would not be used in this seasons performances. 
Instead, the ballet now performs to an orchestral record
ing. According to an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 
the company claims it will save over $500,000 by holding 
performances without a live orchestra. The money saved 
would alleviate part of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatres 
nearly $1 million deficit.
Negotiations had been in progress during the summer 
between the Pittsburgh Ballet and the orchestra 
musicians, who are represented by the Pittsburgh
Musicians Union. According to the musicians, the two 
parties only met for negotiations once, when they re
quested financial records from the Pittsburgh Ballet The
atre. They werent forthcoming with all the information 
that we required, said George Clewer, president of the 
musicians union. [Were] entitled to their financial re
cords.
The musicians union, Local 60-471, has filed an unfair 
labor practice charge, because they were not informed 
before the PBT eliminated live music for the season and 
because the full financial records were never provided to 
the union.
The protests outside Carmen began one hour before the 
performances and ended once the show began. Marching 
on the streets outside the Benedum Center, some 
musicians played their instruments as hundreds of audi
ence members entered the theater. One man played near 
a sign that read: This is the only live music you will hear 
today.
Could the situation have been avoided? The debt cer
tainly isnt going anywhere. Clewer, however, provided 
a unique perspective, though he notes he does not have 
an insiders view on the budget: What shouldve hap
pened years ago is [that] everybody whos respon
sible for fundraising should have had a better idea
earlier that this situation was going to present 
itself.
Theres a difficult debate waging about cutting 
live music. On one side, the Pittsburgh Ballet 
Theatre claims financial difficulties have led 
them to this hard decision. On the other, its mu
sicians claim the decision to cut live music was 
made unfairly, without their consent, and that 
the current quality of the ballet is diminished 
without them.
Though the Pittsburgh Ballet hopes to get the or
chestra back as soon as they can, the fact that the 
musicians were eliminated is frightening for mu
sic students. If theyre going to can music now, 
saidMegZervoulis,aseniorinpianoperformance, 
once we get out of school the opportunities 
for us to have live music experiences will be 
scarce and hence our education will be kind of 
obsolete. Zervoulis helped to organize the 
group of students from Carnegie Mellon who 
attended the protests during Carmen.
Clewer also commented on how it is becoming even more 
daunting to get into the music performance industry. In 
the best of times, in the best of circumstances, the mu
sic business is very tough, he said. I think that every
one whos in music school is probably developing a sense 
of that, because theres so much competition, he added 
When something like this happens, when 40-plus musi
cians are immediately out of work, it makes it even more 
difficult. The implication would be that theres that much 
less work for anybody.
Several of Carnegie Mellons own music students 
were at the Benedum Center on October 6, supporting 
the orchestra and putting their two cents onto signs. 
Zervoulis, who led the students to Benedum that night, 
described how Cynthia Anderson came to speak to 
students in the music program about the situation with 
the orchestra. Afterwards, we decided to get a group 
together, said Zervoulis.
Zervoulis said that about 25 music students and some 
faculty members came to the protest. Though not every
one who had heard Anderson speak came to the protest, 
Zervoulis said, I can guarantee that... everyone [there] 
was very, very passionate about showing their support in 
some way. Many of them wrote many personal letters to 
the organization.
8pAOOseuM h lcdesFS ybbBM

---------------------------------------------------

When they arrived, the students were given flyers to 
hand out. Zervoulis described the scene: Some of the 
orchestra set up a Dixieland band and we were basically 
just energizing the people. [Some] people beeped their 
horns.
Those who hail from Pittsburgh, or have learned to love 
it, might look with alarm at the situation of the arts in the 
city. The Pittsburgh Ballet is not likely to leave the city 
for good, but concerns have been raised about the qual
ity of the performance now that the dancers perform to 
recorded music.
Ballet is not dance with musical accompaniment, 
emphasized Clewer. To me this would be the same as to 
put the orchestra in the pit and have them accompany a 
videotape of the dancers. He added that by eliminating 
the musicians the ballet has more or less destroyed the 
product. Jeanne Gleason says she wants to save the 
ballet, he said. She already hasnt.

Members of the Pittsburgh Musicians Union protest outside the 
Benedum Theatre.
On Carmens opening night, Gleason, chairwoman of 
the ballet board, spoke to the Tribune-Review about get
ting the music back into the ballet. All of this very nega
tive publicity has impacted us.... Were trying as hard as 
we can to get the music back.
Clewer said he would like to see the orchestra performing 
again during the current season, though the boards an
nouncement on August 1 said the entire season would be 
performed without live music.
With the situation of the ballet orchestra in mind, 
one might expect that music students would become 
somewhat discouraged. Though Clewer noted how very 
competitive the business is, he also said that students 
need to do what they love most. If music is what you 
really love and theres nothing else in your life that means 
as much, youve got to do it, Clewer said. But he cau
tioned: If you feel the same way about selling shoes that 
you do about music, then go sell shoes.... If music is the 
only thing you want to do, then you have to do it.
For students of music, the key to having the drive to 
succeed in the face of job scarcity may be a desire to 
achieve a single goal. For the art situation in Pittsburgh, 
Clewer says the solution may lie in music education.
You dont start learning when youre 40 years old, Clewer 
emphasized; You want to see music programs flourish 
in school rather than being cut out. According to an 
article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, public school music 
teachers had joined the ranks of the orchestra during 
the protest. Members of the Pennsylvania Music Educa
tors Association have asked that the association reject an 
offer to bring student choirs to sing or play music at the 
Benedum during the Christmas season. The Christmas 
childrens concerts have been a yearly tradition at the 
theater.
Members of Carnegie Mellons faculty have been di
rectly affected by the switch to recorded music, including 
Robert Skavronski, the Ensembles Manager for the School 
of Music. Skavronski is a member of the Pittsburgh Ballet 
Orchestra and attended the protests outside of Carmen.
The current situation with the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre is 
a well-known one  other companies around the country 
have been forced to switch to recorded music for financial 
reasons. Both the board of directors for the ballet as well 
as the musicians union say they want live music back as 
soon as possible.
Courtesy of keeppbtmusiciive.com
Members of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra play outside in down
town Pittsburgh to draw attention, to their cause.
Will music majors become scarcer as the arts in Pittsburgh 
and to some extent across the nation face financial diffi
culties? I dont know if it really has that much of a lasting 
effect on all of the music majors, said Zervoulis. I think 
it would be seen as just another sad thing. If Clewer is 
right, then those who have the talent and ambition will 
continue on their paths as planned. I still truly believe 
theres always room at the top for the best people, he ex
plained; its just a bigger challenge now. I never dissuade 
anybody from going into music. Dont let them tell you 
what you can and cannot do.
As for the future arts supporters in Pittsburgh, the state of 
the arts in Pittsburgh may lie with those who are growing 
up to appreciate art now. As Clewer said, If we have kids 
who are sophisticated... [if] we have bright young people, 
they will support [the arts]; they will enjoy it.

Things to do in lectures instead of paying attention
Sitting in a large lecture hall on a particularly lazy day, I looked 
around and noticed that more than half the class had a laptop 
with multiple screens opened, busily typing away. People were 
talking on AIM, playing Party Poker, or poking people on 
Facebook  that is, until I noticed something unusual.
The act itself was not unusual, but the situation as a whole was 
so unutterably extraordinary that I couldnt believe my eyes. 
Directly seated in front of me was a student who was browsing 
through pom on his computer. Yes. Porn. Of all the activities to 
be engaging in, in public, watching porn was the last thing that 
I expected to witness.
We all have days when paying attention in class is not a priority. 
Sleep, poker, tic-tac-toe, and instant messaging sometimes just 
are infinitely more appealing. So what happens when we find 
ourselves stuck in a class with nothing to distract us? We need to 
let our muse kick in and come up with our own list of attentiongrabbing useless things to do.
1. Count how many times the professor uses uh, umm, or 
like during an entire lecture.
2. Try to hold your breath for as long as you can without passing 
out. Time yourself. Record your time. Repeat.
4. Write a play about an angry lobster, a happy penguin, and an 
evil genius.
5. Plug your ears and try to see if you can lip-read what the 
professor is saying.

HOROSCOPES
BY LARA VOIGT
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): You are going to make good friends with 
a man this week, a Russian named Vlad.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Avoid siblings; danger comes in pairs 
this week.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Choose your values wisely. Certain 
relationships may have to be sacrificed in favor of long-term friendships. 
Dont blow off your roommate in favor of that Facebook message you got 
yesterday saying someone has a huge crush on you.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Avoid Health Services for a while; they 
may tell you a few things youd rather not know.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): You may be feeling reflective and nostalgic 
this week, but dont look back on the past too much. Theres a reason its 
the past and why it should stay theres Seriously, no one wants to relive, 
your rendition of Wicked in the middle of the UC. 
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Make sure to control your temper 
this week. It may cause friction between you and your close friends (i.e., 
avoid your jar of Jiffy for a few days).
LIBRA (September 23 - October 22): Be ready for the sudden attack, be 
it from a biology professor, a cricket player, or that unknown acid youre 
using in lab this week.
SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21): Try not to hold too many grudges 
this week; your reasoning probably isnt too sound, and eh, grudges are
way too much effort.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Your true feelings will 
be revealed by the end of this week. Hopefully thatll be a good thing. 
Youll find out for yourself though.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Stock up on a few classic 
movies this weekend  the cold is driving people indoors, and having a 
few romantic reels around may help your chances of spending a week
end with that sexy physics major you met in Wean.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Although it may be your star 
sign, avoid water at all costs for the next few days. Were talking bad 
consequences  stick to dry ground until further notice.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Its time to shake things up. Get a 
new haircut, say hi to a new person, or take a bus and see where you 
end up in half an hour. Maybe just go with a new haircut.
