NSF director Subra Suresh named next CMU president 
JACKSON LANE 
Senior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon University announced its selection 
of Subra Suresh as the universitys ninth president last 
Tuesday. Suresh will take of?ce at Carnegie Mellon on 
July 1, succeeding President 
Jared Cohon after his 16 years 
of service.
Carnegie Mellon announced its selection to the 
university community with a 
campus-wide email from Ray 
Lane, chairman of Carnegie 
Mellons Board of Trustees. 
The announcement marks the 
decision of the universitys 
presidential search committee, which is comprised of 
faculty and alumni and was 
established in 2012 to ?nd a 
successor to Cohon.
Suresh announced his resignation as director of the 
National Science Foundation 
(NSF) last Tuesday in a letter 
to agency staff. The NSF is a 
$7-billion government agency 
charged with advancing all 
?elds of fundamental science 
and engineering research and 
education. Since his appointment by President Barack 
Obama in August 2010, Suresh 
has established a record of accomplishments and support 
for international and interdisciplinary research and education, including programs 
like Integrated NSF Support 
Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education 
(INSPIRE) and Partnerships 
for Enhanced Engagement in 
Research (PEER).
Following Sureshs announcement of his departure, 
the White House issued statement thanking Suresh for his 
service to the country: We 
have been very fortunate to 
have Subra Suresh guiding the 
National Science Foundation 
for the last two years.
Suresh also brings an illustrious background in academia. Prior to leading the 
NSF, Suresh was dean of the 
School of Engineering at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT), where he 
also holds an advanced degree 
in materials engineering and 
is distinguished as the Vannevar Bush Professor of Engineering. Suresh has also held 
faculty appointments at MIT

Sarah was a ?rst-year at Carnegie 
Mellon when a friend sexually assaulted her.
One night when I was really 
drunk I somehow ended up at his 
apartment, she said. Hes a cool 
guy, but he was drunk too. And I 
started kissing him and it was ?ne  
like, I was ?ne with that  and then 
he went further and then I said no, 
but then he kept on continuing and I 
was drunk at the time so  I kind of 
just went with it.
Thats my story. Its a very typical 
college [story], Sarah, now a senior, 
added.
Her story is indeed typical of many 
experiences of university women. According to a study released last year 
by the Department of Justice (DOJ), 
nearly one in four college women are 
victims of rape or attempted rape. At 
Carnegie Mellon  which has 2,664 
undergraduate women, according to the universitys institutional 
research and analysis department 
 that means that over 660 female 
undergraduate students are likely to 
have experienced sexual assault or 
attempted sexual assault by the time 
they graduate. The DOJ also reported that 90 percent of those women 
know their attackers.
And many, including Sarah, never 
report the assault. The DOJ estimates 
that fewer than 5 percent of college 
women who are victims of rape or attempted rape report it the police. The 
Carnegie Mellon University Police 
Department said in its Annual Security and Fire Safety Report that only 
four police reports of forcible sex offenses had been ?led in 2011; only 
one was ?led in 2010; and six were 
?led in 2009.
University students have an alternative to ?ling a police report, 
though: Title IX of the Educational 
Amendments of 1972 mandates that 
universities have a disciplinary procedure for students to ?le complaints 
of sexual harassment and sexual 
violence. At Carnegie Mellon, this 
means that students can ?le a report 
through a Sexual Assault Advisor 
(SAA) and have their cases handled 
by the University Disciplinary Committee (UDC).
According to Gina Casalegno, 
dean of Student Affairs, 24 such reports were ?led in 2012. But the lack

The university will be issuing tax-exempt bonds to 
?nance the construction of 
the Sherman and Joyce Bowie 
Scott Hall, Carnegie Mellon 
Treasurer Jay Calhoun recently announced.
Scott Hall will be the new 
home for nanofabrication, the 
biomedical engineering program, and the Wilton E. Scott 
Institute for Energy Innovation; it will be located between 
Wean and Roberts Hall and  
will link Hamerschlag, Porter, 
Roberts, and Wean Hall in an 
attempt to provide greater 
campus connectivity. 
The project is estimated to 
cost $95 million, consisting of 
$35 million in gifts and $60 
million in bond ?nancing. Issuing bonds is selling debt: 
The issuer owes the holder 
money and is required to repay them with interest. Initial 
investors who buy the bonds 
tend to be larger institutions. 
Carnegie Mellon decided to 
borrow $60 million, because 
this amount allows the university to retain its Standard 
and Poors AA credit rating. 
This credit rating, along with 
its stable outlook, is a strong 
rating, according to Calhoun.
Additionally, the interest 
rates are currently at a historical low, and according to 
Calhoun, it is a good time to 
borrow. 
Carnegie Mellon is issuing 
bonds in a tax-exempt environment, allowing for lower 
borrowing costs. Although 
this type of environment could 
lead to use restrictions on the 
building, the situation with 
Scott Hall is consistent with 
the rules of the tax-exempt 
market.
One of the things that is 
really attractive about this 
building is that we expect a 
lot of the work that will be 
done in the building [by researchers] will be sponsored 
more often than not by various federal government entities, Calhoun said. In that 
case, take a particular contract 
from, lets say, the Department 
of Energy: They allow us to 
recover indirect costs, including the costs of space.... There 
should be a good stream of income coming back to us from 
research sponsors. 
There is, however, risk involved with increasing debt. 
Although the debt is at a ?xed 
interest rate, meaning the cost 
of the debt will not increase, it 
has pushed Carnegie Mellon 
closer to a lower, A+ credit 
rating. If we had unfortunate economic events  lets 
say we had another crisis-like 
year in the investment market 
and we lost 20 to 30 percent of 
the value of our endowment, 
 those kinds of things could 
have a greater impact because 
we are that much closer to 
that boundary, Calhoun said. 
There are lots of things that 
can happen to your ?nancial 
condition, some of which you 
control, some of which you 
dont.
Furthermore, there is concern about what government 
research funding will look like 
in the future, and about how 
demographics indicate that 
college enrollments are dropping.
Sophomore business major Ari Halevy thinks that the 
risk was worth taking. The 
government has had a strong 
history of funding university research since the 1940s, 
even when the private sector 
couldnt afford to, he said. 
Regardless of the future state 
of our economy, the federal 
stream of funds will remain 
relatively stable in comparison to other government programs.
Dahiana Jimenez, a sophomore statistics major, said,  
Predictions are not reassuring. Believing that there will 
be a lot of research sponsors is 
not the same as having them 
already lined up. I believe that 
selling the bonds will be worth 
the risk if there is a concrete 
list of enough research sponsors committed to the programs, and if there is a guarantee that tuition rates will 
not increase because of it.
Carnegie Mellon currently 
has $509 million in long-term 
debt, including the new $60 
million issued in bonds.

Senate discusses spring trip funding
BRIAN TRIMBOLI 
Assistant News Editor
This spring break, a number of Carnegie Mellon student organizations will still 
go on both domestic and international trips, despite last 
years funding cuts by the 
Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC).
Last spring, the JFC made 
the decision to stop allocating money for travel expenses 
incurred by these trips, making it dif?cult for many organizations to keep their travel 
budgets. 
Organizations attending trips this year include 
ENACTUS, Engineers Without Borders, Alternative 
Spring Break, Habitat for Humanity, and the Global Medical Brigades.
Were not saying spring 
break trips arent good; were 
not saying theyre not valuable; we just have a ?nite 
amount of resources, especially considering that last 
year was the toughest year 
we ever had, said Jon Mark, 
senior lighting design major 
and student body vice president for ?nance, about the 
decision to cut spring break 
trip funding.
Student Body President 
Will Weiner, senior decision science and economic 
and statistics double major, 
agrees that spring break trips 
are valuable for students, but 
at the same time represent 
a signi?cant portion of the 
JFCs budget. Its not they 
we didnt think they are valuable, we did, and I still think 
they are; its that we just 
didnt have the money, so you 
had to make a judgment call, 
he said.
The absence of the JFCs 
funding leaves many organizations with a funding gap, 
which they are trying to ?ll 
by asking the Student Senate for special allocations. 
Special allocations, as stated 
in the Senate Fiscal Policy 
article IV, section A, should 
provide ?nancial support 
for events and organizations 
that bene?t Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys undergraduate 
students.
William Elmore, member 
of the Senate ?nance committee and junior engineering and public policy and 
civil engineering double 
major, described the process 
student groups go through 
to get funding from the Senate, JFC, or any other student 
government body.
Organizations apply, and 
then I set up a meeting between them and the ?nance 
committee, and then the 
committee makes a recommendation to the general 
body, and then the general 
body votes, Elmore said.
Over the past two weeks 
the Senate has been debating 
whether or not to follow the 
JFCs precedent regarding 
the funding of organizations 
taking spring break trips. According to Elmore, Student 
Senate has about $70,000 of 
the money generated from 
the student activities fee to 
allocate.
[The Senate] doesnt 
have to go speci?cally with 
the word of the JFC, so theyre 
kind of in a philosophical debate now about how they 
spend their money to possibly help these groups get off 
their feet, Weiner said.
In light of the JFCs decision to stop funding travel 
expenses for organizations 
going on spring break trips, 
the Student Senate executive committee came up with 
three possibilities for making 
decisions about these organizations. One possibility is 
following the JFC and not allocating any money to any of 
the groups. Another would 
be to fund up to 5 percent of

Unique research maps poisonous plants
Carnegie Mellon researchers are compiling a 
digital database in order to 
better identify poisonous 
plants.
Marios Savvides, director of the CyLab Biometrics 
Center at Carnegie Mellon, 
said in a university press 
release, These plants are 
in our backyards and often 
wind up on our patios and 
even in our living rooms to 
add color during drab winter 
weather, so we really need to 
be aware of their impact on 
our health.
Savvides is working in 
conjunction with Cynthia 
Morton, associate curator 
and botany expert at the 
Carnegie Museum of Natural 
History.
We are developing a 
comprehensive digital database with all the most 
dangerous plants and how 
these plants impact human 
health, Morton said in a 
university press release. 
Because plants cant 
move to escape their predators, they must have other 
means of protecting themselves. Some plants have 
physical defenses such as 
thorns, but by far, the most 
common protection is chemical and thats where the 
poisonous plants come into 
play, she said.
Although being poisoned 
by these plants rarely means 
death for the victim, the researchers believe that the 
ability to map and track 
where the poisonous plants 
cross paths with large portions of the population is 
critical to public safety.
The researchers hope to 
develop a smartphone app 
that will be able to identify a 
plant, its location, its level of 
toxicity, and an antidote for 
the poison just by taking a 
photograph with the phone.

Giant Eagle Auditorium, Baker Hall A51 
 
Over the past 10 years, Carnegie Mellon University has 
strengthened its standing in the humanities thanks to 
distinguished faculty in the English, History, Modern 
Languages and Philosophy Departments as well as 
generous support from numerous foundations, 
corporations and individuals. 
 
To celebrate CMU's excellence in the humanities, the 
Dietrich College and the Center for the Arts in Society will 
host a program and reception featuring: 
Remarks by Dean John Lehoczky 
 
Keynote address by 
Michael Witmore 
Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library

Assault cases are underreported
in materials, mechanic, and 
biological engineering. At 
MIT, Suresh again developed 
a reputation for promoting 
interdisciplinary initiatives 
and research. Suresh has coauthored more than 240 research articles, and his name 
appears on 22 national and 
international patent applications, according to The New 
York Times.
Suresh marks the third 
consecutive Carnegie Mellon 
president with an advanced 
degree in engineering from 
MIT, following Cohon and 
Robert Mehrabian. Although 
this particular achievement 
was not part of the search 
committees criteria in evaluating candidates, Cohon 
states Given the importance 
of engineering at Carnegie 
Mellon, its no surprise that 
people with experience in 
engineering line up well with 
Carnegie Mellons strengths.
Cohon also added that 
Sureshs experience at a prestigious research university  
like MIT makes him a better ?t 
for Carnegie Mellons decentralized culture. He is very 
used to the type of decentralized and interdisciplinary approach that we have, since 
MIT operates in the same 
way, he said.
I think that CMU got a 
star, and I am excited to work 
hard and see what CMU can 
accomplish with Dr. Suresh at 
the helm, said John Mackey, 
associate department head 
of mathematical sciences at 
Carnegie Mellon.
While his announcement 
to leave his post at the NSF 
in the middle of what was 
supposed to be a six-year 
term has left some of his colleagues puzzled, Suresh has 
expressed praise and admiration for Carnegie Mellon and 
describes the presidency as 
an offer he cannot turn down. 
He knows that the university 
is better than its rankings and 
reputation implies, Cohon 
said.
In an interview published 
in the Chronicle of Higher Education following Carnegie 
Mellons announcement of 
their selection, Suresh cites 
Carnegie Mellons interdisciplinary culture in particular. 
We are particularly pleased 
that he has recognized the 
outstanding achievements 
of our faculty, students and 
alumni  many of whom are 
breaking new ground at the 
intersection of technology, 
business, and the arts, Lane 
wrote in his email.
Since Sureshs appointment as director in 2010, the 
NSF has recognized and supported Carnegie Mellon projects and research in engineering, computer science, and 
architecture with more than 
$7 million in grants, awards, 
and sponsorships.
This type of enthusiasm 
ties directly into the presidents role of promoting the 
university and growing its image.
Cohon, who worked during his tenure to increase the 
universitys prestige and expand its presence, describes 
the role of the president as 
cheerleader-in-chief. According to Cohon, the announcement of Sureshs appointment alone has already 
raised awareness and recognition for Carnegie Mellon.
The fact that he is international is a very important 
statement for us as a university and keeps us on a good 
trajectory to grow our global 
brand, commented senior 
economics and statistics and 
decision science double major 
Will Weiner, who also serves 
as Carnegie Mellons student 
body president. I think he is 
the perfect choice to put us on 
level with the few other toptier institutions that are considered better than CMU.
Sureshs departure from 
the NSF and appointment at 
Carnegie Mellon comes at a 
time when both organizations 
face the effects of possible 
mandatory 5 percent cuts in 
federal spending as part of 
government austerity measures. His understanding of 
research universities, including his career at MIT and his 
directorship of the NSF, will 
be important to us as we navigate the ever-changing world 
of federally funded research,  
Randal Bryant, dean of the 
School of Computer Science, 
commented.
The university needs an 
advocate who will secure 
federal research funding and 
long-term ?nancial resources 
for Carnegie Mellon, even as 
the federal budget faces sequestration, Cohon said. I 
cant think of anyone more 
quali?ed than Dr. Suresh.
Suresh, his wife, and their 
two daughters will be on campus on Feb. 21 for a welcome 
celebration, and the family will be relocating to Pittsburgh over the summer. Cohon states that he will spend 
as much time with Suresh as 
he needs to get him settled in 
to his new job.
Cohon will be taking a year 
of leave after Suresh takes of?ce. After that year, Cohon 
plans to return to Carnegie 
Mellon as a professor of civil 
and environmental engineering.

PRESIDENT, from A1
travel costs. The Senate could 
also make a decision based 
on the travel metric, which 
gives $194 per person going 
on the trip. This way, each 
traveler gets his or her student 
activities fee back but nothing 
more.
Senate Chair Bianka Roy, 
a senior in materials science 
and engineering, makes it 
clear that the Senate is not 
bound to one of these three 
options, but rather Its more 
like three philosophies, and 
weighing the pros and cons 
for each philosophy. And we 
presented those three to the 
group to say that these are 
what you can argue; if this is 
what you believe, then you 
should vote for it.
Organizations are also 
receiving some ?nancial assistance this year from the 
department of student affairs. 
Mark sent an email to the 
heads of organizations going 
on spring break trips, saying I 
brought this up with Dean of 
Student Affairs Gina Casalegno to see if her division might 
be able to provide ?nancial assistance. We met on Monday, 
and it looks like [the department of student affairs] will 
be able to provide some level 
of ?nancial assistance, for this 
year only.
Mark said that Casalegno 
would be able to provide anywhere in the range of ?ve to 
seven thousand for all the 
organizations in question, 
writing in his email that this 
money is in lieu of JFC funding, and not associated with 
Senate or [the Graduate Students Association].
Casalegno said in an email, 
We have a long-standing 
commitment to allocate money from Student Affairs to alternative break experiences, 
which are typically funded 
through the Tartans Abroad 
funding process for international trips and through the 
DOSA funding committee 
for domestic trips. This year 
I have offered to assist with 
additional funding given the 
impact of JFC cuts and other 
reductions in funding sources 
for many groups.
Organizations typically 
also receive funding from 
other sources, including their 
own fundraising efforts, member dues, grants, academic 
departments within Carnegie 
Mellon, and donations from 
alumni. Every organization 
going on a spring break trip 
this year is on probation with 
the JFC for overspending their 
budgets in past years.
Mark said, If [a group] 
overspends more than 10 percent of their budget, they get 
put on supervised probation; 
if its over 25 percent, theyre 
put on controlled probation. 
And so, if youre on controlled 
probation, you have to be on 
supervised [probation] the 
next year.
Its important to note that, 
the way our system is set up, 
its very easy for a group to be 
put on probation. Just because 
they have that label doesnt 
mean that theyre struggling 
or that something is necessarily wrong, Roy said.
Mark is putting measures 
in place this year to prevent 
overspending. 
He said, One of the ways 
that Im curtailing that this 
year is that all of these groups 
that are on probation, they 
have to sign agreements to say 
that the member has to pay 
the difference at the end.
As special allocation requests from spring break organizations are received, the 
Senate will make decisions 
based on the options outlined 
by the executive committee 
and additional input from the 
Senate body.
Roy said that the priority, 
in the end, is always the wellbeing of the university and the 
student body.
I just think its important 
for everyone to know that we 
do take these allocations really serious, and we as the executive committee and the Senate have spent countless hours 
debating, looking at the facts, 
looking at different philosophies, thinking about how we 
can properly allocate money 
to our constituents and really 
try to help them the best way 
that we can, being fair to the 
entire university, she said.

Student Senate has been debating whether or not to provide special allocations to spring break trips.
of reports doesnt mean that 
sexual assault isnt a problem 
at Carnegie Mellon: As Casalegno said in an interview, I 
dont think we have any more 
or any fewer problems here. 
I think this is a societal problem.
Rebecca Jacobs, an SAA 
and senior psychology and 
Hispanic studies double major, agreed that sexual assault is a problem  even 
at Carnegie Mellon. I dont 
think people realize that it 
happens as much as it actually does. I think  theres the 
whole joke and perception 
that people arent having sex 
here, [but] people are having 
sex here, she said. And just 
because CMU is a very unique 
school and a very unique experience doesnt mean that 
its isolated from the statistics 
and the world of sexual assault.
Fear of coming forward
The DOJ cites fear of retribution as a reason why many 
women dont ?le a report, but 
Jeannine Heynes, the coordinator of gender programs, often sees another reason why 
students dont pursue disciplinary cases.
When speaking to sexual 
assault survivors, she said, 
she often hears  I dont 
want to go forward with it, I 
dont want to get this person 
in trouble  they say that a 
lot, I dont want to ruin this 
persons life. Very often 
survivors choose not to do 
anything at all. Its somebody 
that they know, its somebody 
that they run in circles with, 
its somebody that they probably care about, and so more 
likely than not, they dont 
want to go forward.
Jacobs also said that part 
of the reason why people 
dont report is because sexual 
assault is too dif?cult to talk 
about. All control is being 
taken away from you. Its 
very violating: This is like 
the most intimate thing that 
someone can be doing [to 
you], she said.
Sarah had similar reasoning for not ?ling a report. I 
dont think there were bad 
intentions on his part. I think 
it was just, like, a situation 
where he was really drunk 
and he didnt realize what 
was happening, she said. 
Because hes a nice guy ... I 
dont think it was him trying 
to take advantage of me.
The role of alcohol
Alcohol is a frequent characteristic of sexual assault 
cases on college campuses; 
the DOJ reports that in three 
quarters of college rapes, the 
offender, the victim, or both 
had been drinking. Casalegno said that, in the cases shes 
seen reviewed at Carnegie 
Mellon, alcohol is a signi?-
cant factor for both parties 
that are involved in an incident that ultimately could 
be determined as sexual assault.
But Heynes is also quick 
to point out that intoxication 
is not an excuse for assault. 
Two drunk people getting 
together  I was too drunk 
to realize that she was too 
drunk  it makes for a very 
gray area in terms of investigation, but its not a gray 
area in terms of youre always 
responsible for your actions. 
And if you were too drunk, 
thats your fault. You needed to get consent, Heynes 
said.
Another problem with sexual assault is that people are 
not aware of what consent is 
and whats involved, Heynes 
said. I think people dont 
realize that the absence of 
no is not consent. So I think

sometimes we get particularly 
in a masculinized culture of 
see how far you can get. And 
if shes silent, then just keep 
going, keep going, keep going. 
And that is so wrong, right? 
That is so wrong.
And very many people 
say She didnt say no or She 
didnt push me away or I just 
thought she was into it. It is 
the responsibility of that other 
person to ask, Is this okay? Is 
this how far you want to go?  
she continued. So silence 
from a partner is not consent.
Heynes also clari?ed that 
women are not the only victims of sexual assault. Most 
of the reports that we get are 
men that sexually assault 
women, but Ive had reports of 
men sexually assaulting other 
men, she said. 
I think another thing 
is that I dont think we talk 
enough about women asking 
men. I think theres that idea 
that men are completely 100 
percent always ready for sex, 
right? And its the women that 
we have to sort of convince, 
Heynes said. But I think there 
also needs to be a culture of 
women asking as well.
Assault education
In order to better educate 
students about sexual assault, 
Casalegno said, weve totally 
revamped our training and our 
review of policy and resources 
and discussion of the issues at 
play with sexual assault and 
sexual violence for ?rst-year 
Orientaton.
Its something we do try to 
be in touch with in programming [for Orientation], and 
even this year, de?nitely we 
changed up the sex skit a lot, 
said Will Weiner, a senior economics and statistics and decision science double major who 
was a head orientation counselor this past fall. As student 
body president, Weiner is on 
the committee that has been 
overseeing the changes to the 
universitys sexual assault and 
harassment policies. After 
[talking to] people in Student 
Life who are involved with 
working with [sexual assault], 
were saying, you know, What 
is the message were trying to 
get across? 
Weiner added, I think its 
very much a freshman year 
issue and then goes away, at 
least in terms of conscientious 
messaging. Obviously theres 
stuff that will be happening 
unfortunately throughout the 
four years, but I feel like messaging-wise its very much a 
freshman year thing.
However, as Heynes pointed out, they only had ?ve, 10 
minutes in front of ?rst-year 
students whove got so much 
on their mind. I dont know  
hopefully it was effective. 
Several ?rst-years, when 
asked what they remembered 
from Orientation, recalled 
Condom Man far more easily than any education about 
sexual assault.
Jillian, a ?rst-year economics major, could recall a skit 
focusing on sexual assault, 
but couldnt remember many 
speci?cs. When asked if she 
thought if Carnegie Mellon 
was on par with the national 
average in regards to sexual 
assault, she replied, I think 
at CMU its probably below, 
but I do know of this girl [who 
was assaulted], so its not, like, 
nonexistent.
Alex James, an undecided 
Dietrich College ?rst-year, actually missed everything on 
that because I had soccer during most of the Orientation 
events. Because of his practice schedule, the only Orientation events he attended were 
Playfair and House Wars.
According to a report on 
acquaintance rape released by 
the DOJ, this one-time educational effort is insuf?cient. 
The Educational programs 
should involve multiple intervention efforts, with repeated 
and reinforced exposure to the 
issue, the report stated.
Raising awareness
Administrators and students are now trying to do 
more to broaden awareness 
and education. Casalegno said 
that they have begun to do 
more outreach programming 
in Greek life communities and 
in residence halls.
Also, Jacobs and three other students  Michelle Ruiz, 
a junior chemical engineering major; Rachael Schmitt, 
a sophomore Dietrich College student; and Esha Shanbhogue, a senior mechanical 
and biomedical engineering 
double major  form the executive board for Got Consent?, 
an organization that works 
with the nonpro?t Pittsburgh 
Action Against Rape (PAAR) 
to spread awareness and education about sexual assault.
This week, in honor of Valentines Day, the group will be 
tabling in the University Center and handing out free greeting cards, posters, candy, and 
condoms. 
A lot of people are worried about how to ask if somethings okay without killing 
the mood, Jacobs explained. 
Its supposed to teach people 
whats a sexy way to ask [for 
consent].
At this years MOSAIC, 
Carnegie Mellons community-wide gender conference, 
one of the things were going 
to address  is this idea of the 
hookup culture, Heynes said. 
Its this idea that people 
are coming to parties in order 
to get drunk in order to hook 
up. And it sort of goes against 
everything that consent and 
healthy relationships and 
knowing yourself and taking care of others is about. 
The conference, themed The 
Naked Truth, will take place 
Feb. 23 and 24 in the University Center.
Other events planned for 
the semester include a Take 
Back the Night event in late 
March, which is a protest 
against sexual violence; a 
Whats In Your Cup? campaign during Carnival, which 
will encourage students to 
be conscientious about what 
theyre drinking and to be 
wary of accepting drinks from 
others; and a Clothesline Project, during which sexual assault survivors and their allies 
will design T-shirts that speak 
out against sexual assault and 
then hang the shirts publicly 
on campus.
In the meantime, Jacobs 
encourages sexual assault survivors on campus to talk to an 
SAA, even if they dont want to 
?le a report. 
The great thing about 
SAAs is that were your peers. I 
know that it can be scary to try 
and talk about this to someone 
who you see as being in a position of authority.... You should 
never feel ashamed about anything that youve done that 
would stop you from coming 
to talk to somebody about it.

Students create magic in Disney Imagineering competition
SONIA KATHARANI-KHAN
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon is famous 
for its prominence in the technical world, but recently, a 
team of Carnegie Mellon mechanical engineering students 
navigated their way to the top 
of one of the worlds most creative realms. Senior mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering double major 
Laura Laham, senior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double 
major Andre Sutanto, and 
senior mechanical engineering major Anisha Vyas were 
selected as one of six ?nalist 
teams in the ImagiNations Design Contest held by Walt Disney Imagineering.
Disney Imagineering is responsible for Disneys design 
and development, including 
the creation of theme parks, 
resorts, cruise ships, and 
entertainment. The design 
competition, ImagiNations, is 
hosted annually to give participants the opportunity to 
exhibit their creative talents as 
well as gain practical skills to 
implement their ideas.
Vyas, Sutanto, and Laham 
entered the contest with Sophia Chan last year and were 
named semi-?nalists; Chan, 
now a Carnegie Mellon alum, 
works for Disney Imagineers. 
This year, the three collaborated with Jane Liu from the 
Art Center College of Design 
in California.
The topic for this years 
contest was to choose any city 
in the world and design an entertainment experience for its 
citizens and tourists. Finalists 
were selected based on guest 
experience, marketing perspective, uniqueness, and collaboration skills.
The teams project, Legenda Emas, is an interactive 
boat ride set in Jakarta, Indonesia. Unlike a number of Disney attractions, which focus 
on common Disney fairy tales, 
the team designed a project 
that immerses participants in 
an Indonesian legend of a betrothed prince and princess 
and a nefarious witch who 
seeks to keep them apart.
When we took a step back 
and realized that this should 
be an original ride from the 
location that were placing it 
in, our project really changed 
and took on a lot more value, 
Laham said.
The attraction takes the 
riders through scenes of the 
legend, and places them as 
volunteers in the Royal Search 
Party whose objective is to follow a golden trail to ?nd the 
princess. Another unique aspect of the ride is that each set 
of riders has a different experience. Participants feel like 
they are a part of the story, so 
they are interactively changing the story as they go, Sutanto said.
The attraction integrates 
technology such as radio-frequency identi?cation, Kinect 
sensors, and computer-generated imagery to allow the 
participants to interact with 
the prince throughout the 
journey. At the end of the ride, 
riders are rewarded with a 
?reworks show for ?nding the 
princess.
For the team members, 
bringing their idea to life was 
both invigorating and challenging.
Its pretty rare to have to 
put all of your creativity into 
one project. Its interesting to 
be drained of that in a way. 
Also, working with the artist 
[Jane Liu], and us being engineers, we came from two completely different mindsets
even between the three of us, 
our mindsets were completely 
different. So trying to ?nd 
a commonality was both our 
strength and the hardest part, 
Vyas said.
In addition to the pressure 
to apply their creativity to the 
fullest, it was also a challenge 
to manage the project in addition to coursework. To me, 
one of the hardest part of this 
projects was the fact that we 
were very passionate about 
the project, so it was hard to 
pull away from it to do other 
classwork, Sutanto said.
Putting the project together provided an opportunity to apply their education 
to bring their ideas to life. 
One of my favorite parts was 
the engineering principles I 
picked up along the way to 
?gure out how the engineering parts should look, or how 
the parts should be redesigned 
to accommodate our vision  
also just applying the train of 
thought to the technology that 
went into it as well, Laham 
said. I didnt think I would 
use the same principles that I 
learned in Intro to Programming to program a Kinect to 
follow my hand, so that when 
I moved it around, something 
would happen on a screen. But 
it was all the same principles, 
which was awesome. 
The ?nalist teams traveled 
on a ?ve-day, all-expense-paid 
-trip to Imagineering headquarters in Glendale, California. 
There, they participated in a 
?nal competition, presenting 
their project in person to a 
panel of Imagineer executive 
judges. Laham, Sutanto, Vyas, 
and Liu won the second-place 
prize of $1,000.
In addition, ?nalist team 
members had the chance to 
interview for paid internships, 
interact with Imagineers, and 
receive behind-the-scenes 
tours. A number of past winners have proceeded to receive 
paid internships and even fulltime employment with Walt 
Disney Imagineering.
All three hope to work for 
Disney Imagineers in the near 
future. Working for Imagineers is one of those lifelong 
goals for any engineer, Vyas 
said.

Psychologists study brain after injury
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Staffwriter
It is dif?cult to undermine 
the importance of the human 
brain in regard to our survival 
and daily functions. When the 
brain is affected by injury, it 
can have long lasting detrimental effects making simple 
things such as remembering 
what you had for breakfast 
very dif?cult. Researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging have successfully combined different techniques to 
learn about how the brain performs simple functions before, 
during, and after an injury.
Scientists have hypothesized that when a speci?c portion of the brain is damaged 
and can no longer function, 
the brain activates secondary 
regions to supplement those 
that are damaged. Marcel 
Just, a professor of psychology 
at Carnegie Mellon and senior 
research psychologist Robert 
Mason had the unique opportunity to combine Repetitive 
Transcranial Magnetic Simulation (TMS) with Functional 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(fMRI) to measure what parts 
of the brain are activated and 
how they coordinate in the 
presence of an injury.
TMS involves generating 
a magnetic ?eld to target a 
speci?c part of the brain, inducing a temporary virtual 
lesion. Mason explained that 
this non invasive and generally safe technique allowed 
us to overstimulate a speci?c 
region of the brain so that 
the region cannot carry out 
its normal function when 
necessary. We targeted the 
Wernicke area of the brain 
that is responsible for speech 
and asked participants of the 
study to read sentences of 
varying dif?culty.
The fMRI enables scientists 
to see which parts of the brain 
are working together. Consistent with their hypothesis, 
Mason and his team found 
that after simulating an injury in a targeted region of the 
brain, higher levels of activity were found in three other 
regions. The contralesional 
region is made up of areas on 
the half of the brain opposite 
the target region; the paralesional region is made up of areas that are immediately adjacent to the target region. Both 
of these regions immediately 
worked to supplement the injured region. In addition, the 
frontal region helped coordinate the contralsional and 
paralesional regions to ensure 
that signals were still being 
sent out to the body.
Mason noticed that when 
impairing a region of the 
brain, other areas of the brain 
that are connected [to the 
injured area] also showed 
signi?cantly reduced activity 
as well. This deviated from 
their expectations: They expected that after simulating 
the injury, the participants 
would exhibit a slower performance and have dif?culty 
with the task at hand due to 
this reduced activity in regions that typically assist with 
the injured areas function. 
However, Mason and his team 
were surprised to ?nd that the 
participants actually became 
better at the task.
Mason explained that after 
overstimulation, the targeted 
region of the brain slowly regains function. The secondary regions that had been 
activated as a result of the 
injury and the injured region 
were both activated at the 
same time giving the brain 
two ways to carry out the 
function. Over time, the secondary regions return to their 
typical functioning.
Mason presumes, We 
could train the brain so that 
these regions could ?ll in in 
the case of more permanent 
damage. 
He added that in education, if students were encouraged to ?nd multiple solutions or methods to deriving 
the correct answer, it would 
force us to recruit regions that 
would not normally function 
for a task. This would allow 
the brain to have a more manageable time recruiting secondary regions to supplement 
an injured region.
Mason and his team are 
curious whether or not their 
results would be consistent if 
they target other regions of 
the brain. Nevertheless, they 
are proud of the hurdles they 
have overcome; Mason feel s 
like their discoveries advance 
the understanding of how the 
brain functions.
Breakthrough in limiting carbon dioxide emissions
By mimicking the way sea 
urchins create their exoskeletons, physicists have developed a means of converting 
carbon dioxide pollution into 
harmless calcium carbonate 
or chalk. Lidija Siller and her 
team at Newcastle University 
realized that they needed a 
catalyst to speed up the process of absorption of carbon 
dioxide into water. While 
examining sea urchins that 
absorb carbon dioxide into 
their skeletons, they found 
that nickel was abundant 
on the exoskeleton of urchin 
larvae. By adding nickel as 
a catalyst to the absorption 
process, they were able to almost completely remove the 
carbon dioxide.
By diverting gases from 
chimneys into water tanks 
saturated with nickel 
nanoparticles, the carbon 
dioxide present in the emissions can be almost completely eliminated, as it will 
react with the water to form 
chalk.

New York Times investigates recent hacker attack
Chinese hackers compromised the computer systems 
of The New York Times and 
The Wall Street Journal at 
the end of last month. The 
attacks seemed to have been 
more personal than previous 
hacks, raising further concerns among enterprises. The 
more targeted an attack, the 
less effective traditional security is. 
In particular, the antivirus software that the Times 
was using failed to detect 44 
different kinds of malware. 
This was because the malware was custom built, and 
current malware detection 
systems are able to catch 
only more generic types. The 
Pentagon plans to expand 
its ranks of cyber-warriors 
to help ?ght against such attacks. However, the lack of 
enough highly-skilled individuals and a ?scally conservative Congress are likely to 
be large obstacles in the Pentagons future recruitment 
plans.

Researchers create material that can repel all ?uids
Dr. Anish Tuteja and his 
team at the University of 
Michigan have developed a 
coating that repels almost all 
?uids. Currently, liquid resistant coatings are either oleophobic (oil-repellent, like 
those on touchscreens) or hydrophobic (water-repellent, 
as on waterproof gear). The 
new coating, dubbed superomniphobic, repels ?uids by 
trapping millions of microscopic pockets of air within itself, so that ?uids are unable 
to come in contact with the 
surface. It is resistant against 
almost all ?uids, including 
highly reactive ones like hydrochloric acid. Currently, 
the durability of the coating 
is an issue, since it can be 
easily peeled off; the team is 
working toward developing a 
more permanent coating.

Blackout during Super Bowl being investigated
The cause of the power 
failure during the Super 
Bowl, which suspended play 
for more than half an hour, 
has been narrowed down to 
a device that ironically, had 
been installed to prevent the 
possibility of a blackout. The 
device was a relay that had 
been installed in the switching gear by Entergy New 
Orleans, the company that 
supplies power to the Superdome. The relay was intended to protect the Superdome 
from a cable failure between 
the companys incoming 
power line and the lines that 
run through the stadium. The 
exact cause for the failure of 
the relay has yet to be investigated.

Architecture professor draws inspiration from biology
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
Carnegie Mellon is known 
for its ?ve-year architecture 
program, yet many students 
do not realize how interdisciplinary the ?eld can be. It 
is more than the design and 
construction of buildings  it 
is the creative combination of 
art and science. Architects do 
not just sketch drawings and 
make building plans  they 
collaborate with scientists 
from all different disciplines 
and develop innovative materials and building technologies to continuously improve 
the world of architecture.
Dale Clifford, assistant professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon, uniquely combines 
biology and architecture. I 
look at natural systems and 
transfer that knowledge into 
building technology. Speci?-
cally what weve been looking 
at is self-regulating systems 
and mechanisms  how does 
an organism tune itself to the 
world around it? Can buildings do this too?
Cliffords unique way of 
revolutionizing architecture 
is the reason why Google has 
asked him to be the materials innovation consultant for 
a new building that the company is designing. Never before has Google designed its 
own building. Google wants 
to know how to use new and 
emerging materials in their 
building practice. Well look 
at a range of materials and my 
team and I will make models, 
take photographs, do experiments and then come back 
and present it to Google to 
see how they can incorporate 
it into their building, Clifford 
explained. This process is riskier than the normal practice of 
picking materials that already 
exist  they are actually developing new products never 
used before in buildings.
Pointing at an image of a 
soaring eagle, Clifford said, 
This bird is continuously 
changing its form in response to 
?uctuating conditions.... This is 
what buildings should do.
One material that Clifford 
has been developing, called 
a phase-change material, is 
going to be used in the Frick 
Park Environmental Center in 
Pittsburgh and is also a possible material for the Google 
project. As it undergoes a 
change in phase, in this case 
from liquid to solid, the material absorbs a large amount of 
latent heat.
Theres a company thats 
making an organic phasechange material based from 
palm oil. This type of material is generally behind walls, 
but we are taking it out of its 
opaque plastic packaging and 
developing a new packaging 
that will allow it to be more 
visible, Clifford said. The 
palm oil material is given a 
target set-point temperature 
so that, as the temperature 
around the building changes, 
the phase-change material 
changes from clear to frosty. 
Most buildings have set 
points of temperature which 
determine when the air conditioning or heating system 
switches on and off; with walls 
made of phase change material, the set point would become 
wider and the air conditioning 
or heating unit would come 
on less, making the building 
more energy ef?cient. Clifford 
proposed to have tiles of this 
sort of material within a glass 
wall, attached to the glass by 
gecko feet ?ber produced by 
mechanical engineering professor Metin Sitti.
Two other proposed projects that allow a building to  
interact with the environment 
are optic-?ber stalks and petals actuated by shape-memory 
alloys. The stalk system would 
look like bundles of ?ber-optic 
tubes with photovoltaic collectors at the tips. Sunlight 
would be ?ltered through the 
tubes to light the interior of 
the building.
The petal system would be 
a series of ?ower-like structures covering a glass wall, 
seen in the picture below. 
The petals are connected to a 
nickel-titanium alloy, which 
contracts at a target temperature. The contracting of the 
alloy pulls the petals down so 
that on a cold day, the petals 
would be closed to let sunlight 
in, while on a hot day, the petals would expand to shade the 
building.
According to Clifford, technologies that allow a building 
to respond to its environment 
accomplish two important 
goals: energy conservation 
and education. Innovations 
such as porous walls, phasechange materials, optic-?ber 
stalks, and petal systems not 
only improve the mechanics 
of a building, but provide a visual representation of how the 
building interacts with its surroundings. By bringing what 
is usually inside walls to the 
exterior of buildings, people 
would directly be able to understand how we are lowering 
reliance on mechanical conditioning, Clifford said.
Innovative building technologies such as those being 
developed by Cliffords team 
require the collaboration of 
scientists from all different 
?elds. Although students in 
the Mellon College of Science 
or Carnegie Institute of Technology might think they have 
nothing to with the School of 
Architecture, Clifford said it 
would be a feast if he could 
work with more scientists and 
engineers from other ?elds.
Architecture always has 
an expanding footprint, Clifford said. In the future I think 
well be collaborating more 
with materials scientists, physicists, chemical engineers, 
to develop new materials for 
buildings that are more responsive. Its happening  its 
not the mainstream, but its an 
undercurrent.

Kyle Hensons column on Jan. 
28 was an ill-informed and hysterical piece that added little to the gun 
control debate. 
His treatment of executive orders was downright embarrassing. 
Although he tries to depict them 
as an usurpation of power by President Obama, in fact the ?rst executive orders date back to the time of 
President Washington, with their 
justi?cation generally traced to Article II of the Constitution. Obamas 
executive orders, which Henson 
amusingly never actually describes 
in detail, followed the exact purpose 
he claims they should have  providing guidance on how to enforce 
laws.
More troubling is his poorly 
thought-out attitude toward the 
Constitution. The Constitution was 
written in the 18th century, in a context completely alien to anything Mr. 
Henson would recognize, both politically and culturally. A multicultural 
nation of 300 million people cannot 
be governed in the same way as a 
small, slave-holding frontier nation. 
If, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia has tried to claim, the Constitution is dead, it would need to be 
taken to the morgue and replaced 
with a living document.
Sincerely,

LETTER TO THE EDITORHenson was ill-informed
CATHERINE SPENCE
Time to ask yourself the age-old 
annual college question: Where are 
you living next semester? As Housing and Dining Services begins its 
housing fairs and prepares to introduce its StarRez application for handling room assignments, Carnegie 
Mellon students have big decisions 
to make regarding where they will 
be sleeping next fall. With options 
ranging from West Wing to Webster 
Hall, its time to start evaluating 
where to live and why.
Living on campus has its bene?ts, 
especially for students without cars 
and those very involved in extracurricular activities. Remaining on 
campus also means that basic necessities like toilet paper and paper 
towels are always at ones disposal. 
Besides these perks, staying on campus also takes a lot of the work out of 
being a resident.
Imagine if you move off campus 
and your window breaks; Facilities 
Management Services isnt going to 
come make sure your bedroom window closes for you. Perhaps you and 
your roommate have disagreements 
over your heaters temperature during the winter months and about 
how to split the utilities bill. Maybe 
your roommate decides to take a 
leave of absence, leaving you with 
a greater fraction of the rent. Unexpected problems like these often 
trouble those living on campus, but 
at least they are left with no ?nancial obligation.
One of the most common arguments for moving off campus goes 
something like this: In real life, you 
dont have the option to live on campus, so you might as well get used to 
it starting now. While I agree with 
the sentiment and concur that real 
life is nothing like on-campus housing, whats the rush in moving off 
campus? If you are going to have to 
eventually live off campus, why do 
it before you must? 
I dont see any harm in living 
on campus for a few more years. 
Furthermore, youll probably never 
again have the opportunity to live in 
a hallway where you know many of 
the residents and can casually walk 
into their bedrooms without being 
considered inappropriate or downright creepy.
Living on campus also allows 
students to stay engaged in campus 
activities. Whether its grabbing free 
food from a resident assistant, chatting with ?oormates, or stumbling 
upon a cool event on a corner of 
campus, chance encounters are far 
less likely to occur for students who 
dont live on campus. How often has 
someone offered you a free meal as 
you walked down Beeler Street?
While I do see the practical bene?ts of cheaper rent, more space, 
and the absence of a campus authority, I dont think they are compelling 
enough to justify living off campus. 
Its easy to miss a payment on a 
bill or to get fed up with choosing 
between walking home from Club 
Hunt late at night or waiting for the 
shuttle to take you to your off-campus destination. 
In the end, Id rather stay on campus and feel like a part of the vibrant 
campus community, even if it means 
paying a bit more.

Corbetts focus on state education is commendable
Do not turn to stimulant pills for academic success
Suresh quali?ed for position of ninth CMU president
Carnegie Mellon announced Subra Suresh as its choice for the new 
university president last Tuesday. 
Set to take of?ce on July 1, Suresh is 
currently the director of the National 
Science Foundation (NSF), and has 
served as the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technologys dean of engineering. 
According to The New York Times, 
he also co-authored more than 240 
journal articles, registered 21 patents, and wrote three books on materials science.
The Tartan congratulates Suresh 
on becoming our new president, and 
thanks the members of the Presidential Search Committee for their excellent choice. 
Suresh is extremely quali?ed for 
the position  given his past experience in leadership roles  and has 
shown a strong commitment to the 
advancement of academic and scienti?c research throughout his career.
Although Suresh left his position 
at the NSF four years earlier than the 
date speci?ed by his six-year term, 
his decision to leave does not appear 
to be an indication of his work ethic. 
The university stated in an of?-
cial email that Suresh is a strategic 
and visionary leader who will build 
upon [Carnegie Mellons] global 
reputation for innovation and excellence in education, research, and 
entrepreneurship....
We hope that Suresh will strive to 
not only maintain but also advance 
our schools achievement, standing, 
and rigorous academic community.
Additionally, we hope that the 
recent ongoing discussion about our 
communitys health and well-being 
will not be overlooked during this 
presidential transition. 
The need to address some of our 
schools cultural shortcomings must 
be recognized in the period during 
and after this momentous leadership 
change.
Noting that Suresh is the director of the NSF, it is important that 
he continue to promote our arts and 
humanities programs too.
We hope for the best from our incoming president and commend the 
university on its selection.
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett 
announced the state budget proposal last Tuesday to the Pennsylvania 
General Assembly. Because Corbetts 
popularity is low  according to CBS 
Pittsburgh, only 31 percent of Pennsylvanians believe he deserves reelection  the proposal may prove to 
be crucial for Corbett. This year, Corbett proposed measures to provide 
greater ?nancial support to Pennsylvania public schools and higher education. While the proposed funding 
is only a small step in the right direction, it is a step for which Corbett 
should be commended.
Funding for education is fundamental to the continued success of 
the region and the state as a whole. 
New efforts to bring back support for 
schools should be applauded.
In the budget, Corbett aims to 
privatize liquor businesses and distributors. This change could result 
in an extra $1 billion for Pennsylvanias education system, $90 million 
of which would go to basic public 
schools, according to the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review. This new proposal 
is a drastic change from last years 
budget, which slashed the budget of 
public higher education institutions, 
such as Pennsylvania State University, by over 30 percent, according to 
The Philadelphia Inquirer.
There are those who doubt that 
the budget proposal will succeed. 
Some people, such as David Fillman, 
executive director of the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, say the pension 
cuts required by the budget would 
be highly contested, according to the 
Trib. Politicians on both sides of the 
aisle seem to have major issues with 
the budget. These qualms may indicate that Corbett is doing something 
right  not trying to appeal solely to 
a single party.
Politics aside, increased funding 
for Pennsylvania schools is vital to 
the states well-being. Ensuring that 
institutions are able to both provide  
top-quality education for students. 
Continuing to support life-changing 
research is crucial to Pennsylvanias 
future. 
In light of a recent article in The 
New York Times describing the death 
of college-age Adderall user Richard 
Fee, it is important to remember that 
Adderall and other  stimulants are 
not the route to academic success.
Here at Carnegie Mellon, the use 
of stimulants may not seem as prevalent or widely discussed as on other 
college campuses. It is not uncommon, though, to hear students talk 
about using Adderall in the library or 
other studying facilities, especially 
during ?nals week.
While prescription medications 
used to treat A.D.D. and A.D.H.D. 
may seem like the answer to a tired 
brain before a late night of studying, 
it is important to consider the effects 
of these pills. 
There are better ways to achieve 
success in college without using 
stimulants.
There are serious risks associated 
with Adderall, including physical 
and psychological dependence, extreme nervousness, and hallucinations, according to prescriptiondrugabuse.org. 
Lets not forget that using prescription drugs without a doctors 
approval is illegal.
Even when prescribed, Adderall 
can cause one out of every 400 patients to experience suicidal thoughts 
or psychotic behavior, according to a 
study by The American Journal of 
Psychiatry in 2006.
Despite these negative side effects, college students across the nation use stimulants to try to perform 
better academically.
The New York Times concluded 
8 percent to 35 percent of college 
students take stimulant pills to enhance school performance.
There are a variety of alternatives 
to Adderall and other stimulants 
that are not drugs, which can help 
students ?nish their studying and 
assignments at appropriate (or inappropriate) times in the evening.
You can ?nd a companion from 
the same class  someone who can 
provide thought-provoking questions related to the assignment  off 
of whom you can bounce ideas. Alternatively, you can plan ahead before the assignments due date.
Even late night snacks can serve 
as motivation for ?nishing 30 pages 
of reading or one page of an essay. A 
positive mind can do wonders for the 
brain as well.
In any case, Adderall and other 
stimulants should never be the answer for completing assignments 
or studying. Sometimes, sleep may 
even be the best answer.

A PERSONS OPINION
February 11, 2013  The Tartan thetartan.org/forum  A9
Compiled by Kelsey Scott
The Tartan has been hitting the books hard this week. So we asked,
What is your favorite place to study on campus?
BRADEN KELNER
Everyone who has met me knows 
that I like scary movies and the 
month of October more than your 
average Halloween fanatic. I have a 
box of Halloween decorations hidden 
in my apartment, a banner reading 
Be Very Afraid above my bed, and 
a collection of horror movies on a living room shelf.
Recently, I started watching 
American Horror Storys ?rst season 
on Net?ix. Even though my friends 
know how much I like the horror 
genre, many of them still wonder 
how I can stand watching movies and 
shows like this.
While I cant give a singular answer to that question, I can pinpoint 
aspects of the horror genre that make 
my spine tingle with pleasure.
Its about the story. Yes, many horror movies consist of mediocre acting 
and unoriginal plots. Some people 
also say that horror movies are pointless gore-fests created to make a few 
bucks at the box of?ce.
While these stereotypes can be 
seen in some movies, there are, without a doubt, several horror movies 
with dynamic plots that leave audiences thinking them over for days. 
Final plot twists can make or break 
a movie, and horror movies produce 
the best ones. Even though the gore 
in the original Saw may be too much 
for some people, try guessing who 
the killer is before the credits roll.
Believe it or not, some horror 
movies even bring fresh ideas to the 
?lm industry. Remember the hype 
surrounding The Blair Witch Project 
and the popularity of found-footage 
?lms after its release? It may not have 
been the ?rst found-footage ?lm, but 
it was de?nitely the ?rst to do it right.
Its also about the scares. Im a 
T-type, or thrill-seeker. I like roller 
coasters and almost any other amusement park ride. The more loops, the 
better. Its no surprise that I like the 
rush that comes when watching horror movies. Theres nothing more 
exhilarating than rising tensions that 
end in a scare. I attribute my enthusiasm for Paranormal Activity to this 
reasoning. The directors of the series 
know how to create tension from the 
tiniest creaks, while slowly building 
to a satisfying scare.
Finally, the horror genre is about 
characters; characters are my favorite part of horror stories. The actors 
themselves may not be memorable, 
but their characters are. Sometimes, 
the characters you grow to love the 
most can turn out to be your worst 
nightmare, but somehow you still 
root for them. The Uninvited, based 
on a South Korean ?lm, introduced 
me to two of my favorite horror ?lm 
characters  Anna and Alex. Without spoiling the movie, these sisters 
defend themselves against their fathers new lover, who they believe is 
trying to kill them. By the end of the 
movie, their judgments cause unnecessary deaths. Regardless, you cant 
help but feel sympathetic for them.
Horror movies may not be for 
everyone, and I know Ill never convince the people who say Im crazy 
for liking them otherwise. One 
things for certain, though: The horror movie genre has been around for 
so long that the creators must be doing something right.

Dont be afraid to like scary movies and television shows
XIYU WANG 
Though it may seem strange to 
think of it in the middle of winter, 
the world is getting warmer. The 
year 2012 was the hottest on record 
for the continental United States, according to climatecentral.org.
Last summer, 19 states had their 
warmest year on record, and 48 
states experienced above-average 
temperatures. Furthermore, 2012 
had the second-highest number of 
extreme-weather; the number of 
heat waves, droughts, and wild?res 
that hit the country ensured that. 
Whats more, global temperatures 
worldwide have begun to increase 
each year. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, each 
year since 1980 has been recorded as 
warmer than average.
With these startling facts, you 
would think that climate change 
would spur a great deal of discussion 
in politics and media. However, that 
is not the case. 
Despite the impact climate 
change has on our lives, reporting 
on climate change has decreased 
in 2012, according to The Huf?ngton Post. In fact, early this year, The 
New York Times announced it was 
disbanding its environmental desk, 
which was responsible for publishing 
stories on climate change.
Although I disapprove of how little climate change is discussed in the 
media, part of me can understand 
why it is a relatively unpopular topic. 
Much of the scienti?c evidence related to climate change is not easily 
relatable to everyday life; few people 
are invested in constant squabble 
over statistics on melting arctic ice 
or rising concentration of greenhouse gases as opposed to, say, gun 
control or illegal immigration. This 
makes emphasizing the dangers of 
climate change very dif?cult; many 
people ?nd it dif?cult to explain 
how a few melting ice caps can spur 
semi-apocalyptic scenarios.
Furthermore, much of the discussion over climate change has been 
unnecessarily politicized. The oil industry and certain politicians often 
question whether climate change is 
real, despite the fact that nearly all 
scienti?c literature agrees that climate change is happening, and that 
a great deal of it can be attributed to 
human actions.
Even though climate is a drab issue, there is really no reason not to 
discuss it. 
In whatever way we can, we 
should attempt to facilitate discussion over climate change. There 
must be some way to make the topic 
more palatable for the average person to understand, perhaps through 
emphasizing more of the human role 
in climate change.
It may be the fact that certain climate change activists are too heavy 
in their messages. For example, 
many people disliked An Inconvenient Truth because they felt that it 
exaggerated the effects of climate 
change and that it had too much of 
an alarmist tone. Al Gore and his 
documentary were heavily mocked 
on shows like South Park for this reason. We could try to be more positive 
in our discussion of climate change 
and focus on ways in which people 
could reduce its effects.
Action is more important than 
ever. Each year we dont act, we release 6 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere, according to discovery.com. 
We need to ?nd a way to reduce 
that number and, in turn, reduce 
the number of storms, droughts, and 
heat waves that have resulted from 
climate change. The consequences of 
inaction are very real, and have human costs.

Time to build a climate for discussion
Carnegie Military University: 
Thats what David Meieran, a Pittsburgh activist, has dubbed Carnegie 
Mellon, alluding to the fact that 
Carnegie Mellon participates extensively in research for the Department of Defense, the CIA and other 
military-related organizations. But 
how extensive are Carnegie Mellons 
ties with the U.S. military?
Meieren claims that every department at Carnegie Mellon has 
some ties with the military, speci?-
cally naming the Psychology Department, the Philosophy Department, 
the Software Engineering Institute, 
and, of course, the Robotics Institute, which works largely on the 
idea of future combat systems, a vision that more armed forces will be 
unmanned, operating on elaborate 
network and robotics systems.
Some robotics projects include 
Gladiator (an unmanned combat 
vehicle equipped with an M-35 machine gun, and a launcher that can 
?re CS gas), Crusher (an unmanned 
ground vehicle), and Dragon Runner (a surveillance vehicle).
Many other projects are con?-
dential and occur at two secluded 
facilities in Lawrenceville, where 
40th street ends at the Allegheny 
River. The facilities (known as the 
NREC and Carnegie Robotics) span 
~350,000 sq. ft. and are monitored 
by at least a handful of armed security personnel nearly 24/7.
Meieran also points out that Jared Cohen, Carnegie Mellons nowretiring president, sat on the Homeland Security Council, from which 
the university has secured over $100 
million in funding.
Considering the evidence, Meieran seems very justi?ed in dubbing 
the university Carnegie Military 
University, but should we be concerned with Carnegie Mellons ties 
with military?
To those in support of U.S. foreign policy, Carnegie Mellons work 
on future combat systems is praiseworthy due to the future possibility 
of reduced U.S. casualties. To Meieran and the vast majority Pittsburghs 
younger population, it comes as a 
disappointment that many of the 
brightest minds in our country are 
utilizing their talents to enable the 
United States aggressive foreign 
policy.
For those disappointed with 
Carnegie Mellons military ties, 
there is hope. Last week, in response 
to widespread criticism of Carnegie 
Mellons stress culture, administrators held a town hall and have been 
considering drastic changes. This 
implies that the administration values feedback from the community 
and that change is possible.
In light of U.S. foreign policy being substantiated in our own backyard, the question remains, Do we 
care to enough to take a stand for 
peace?
If so, I urge you to email Raymond Lane, the chairman of the 
board of directors for Carnegie Mellon, at rjl@andrew.cmu.edu and 
Carnegie Mellons incoming president, Subra Suresh, at ssuresh@mit.
edu to let them know that any bene?ts resulting from military funding 
are far outweighed by the destruction caused from bolstering an aggressive foreign policy.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Sports mentality to blame for cheating
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
Every spectator would like 
to think that sports are clean 
and pure. In fact, sports are 
based on the premise that 
each competition takes place 
on an even playing ?eld, 
with only size, skill, and wit 
determining the outcome. 
This premise is unfortunately 
?awed. 
The same competitive 
drive that makes athletes 
train for hours a day to become their best also drives 
them to ?nd any edge possible to gain an advantage.
Lance Armstrong was supposed to be the poster child 
for doing things the right 
way. In a sport ?lled with 
doping, Armstrong was the 
glimmer of hope that training 
and natural ability can out 
perform drugs. 
After his publicized bout 
with cancer, Armstrong went 
on to win seven consecutive Tour de Frances, setting 
a new record for the sport.  
He met accusations of doping with ?erce rebuttal, then 
used his fame to create and 
lead Livestrong, an organization dedicated to ?ghting 
cancer, branded by those 
trademark yellow Livestrong 
rubber bracelets.
This idealistic image came 
crashing down after Armstrongs admission to Oprah 
Winfrey that he did in fact 
use Human Growth Hormones (HGH), blood doping, 
and other banned substances 
to help win each of his titles. 
His confession came on the 
heels of his refusal to continue ?ghting United States 
Anti-Doping Agency charges. 
This defeat ended with Armstrongs lifetime ban from the 
sport.
Armstrong negated much 
of his great charity work with 
his blatant lies about doping. 
He once ruined several reporters careers after they attempted to make allegations 
about his drug usage. Positive 
views of him are no longer in 
the court of public opinion. 
But is America really upset 
about his drug use or his lies? 
After all, more than a third 
of the top 10 ?nishers in the 
Tour de France since 1998 
have admitted to using performance enhancing drugs.
When talking about performance-enhancing drugs 
(PEDs), steroids and baseball 
are the ?rst things that come 
to mind. 
Baseballs steroid era went 
well into the last decade, with 
its ?rst stars now facing the 
true court of public opinion, 
the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame committee. 
That committee, made up 
of the Baseball Writers Association of America, has made 
it quite clear that they believe 
no player that has ever been 
linked to steroids should be 
admitted to the Hall of Fame.
This seems contradictory 
since, before steroids, the 
use of amphetamines (also 
known as greenies) among 
baseball players was substantial. 
Many current Hall of Famers have admitted to taking 
greenies on a near daily basis, 
and yet they do not have the 
stigma that steroid usage has 
attached to them. 
Some current drug tests 
consist solely of a urine test 
and can be used to identify 
steroids and other common 
PEDs (such as Viagra or Adderall), but HGH and other 
designer drugs can only be 
identi?ed using a more invasive blood test. 
The MLB just approved 
blood testing for the upcoming season, and the NFL and 
NBA are currently in talks to 
implement testing for their 
upcoming seasons. These 
new testing protocols have 
increased the market for both 
designer and natural, and 
thus legal, PEDs.
While little is known 
about designer drugs, all 
natural, legal alternatives to 
steroids are gaining press. 
The little information we 
know about designer drugs 
comes from month-long exposs into personal health 
clinics that are masquerades 
for drug clinics. One of these 
clinics was recently busted in 
South Florida.
Natural alternatives have 
also been in the news. The 
most recent example of these 
new alternative enhancers is 
the two-man company Sports 
with Alternatives to Steroids 
(SWATS). 
Sports Illustrated ran a 
large expos on the company 
and their main product, deerantler spray, just before the 
Super Bowl. A large portion 
of the article focused on Baltimore Ravens veteran linebacker Ray Lewis and his unusually speedy recover from a 
torn right tricep.
Deer-antler spray is formulated from the antlers of a 
New Zealand species of deer. 
Its effect comes from its high 
concentrations of IGF-1, or 
insulin-like growth factor. 
IGF-1 is banned by every pro league as well as the 
NCAA, but there is still very 
little that can be done to test 
for it with enough accuracy 
to punish players based on its 
?ndings.
Athletes will always be 
looking for the item, or supplement, that will give them 
an edge, whether its HGH, 
greenies, or deer-antler spray. 
As long as Americans continue to idealize the win at 
all costs mentality, we must 
also accept the fact that PEDs 
and other cheating methods 
will be a part of sports. 
While we should never 
give up on trying to keep 
cheating out of the game, it is 
important to remember that 
all of the loopholes and PEDs 
are available to every player, 
thus creating a uniquely level 
playing ?eld for each era. 
Therefore, we can feel 
con?dent electing the best 
players of each generation 
to the Hall of Fame, knowing that they were the best 
among their peers, and that 
true transgenerational comparisons, while fun, are also 
trivial.
ATHLETE PROFILEEmerson hits the slopes for CMU

Carnegie Mellons womens basketball team celebrated two victories at home this 
weekend against Brandeis 
University and New York University. The Tartans wins 
were particularly special as 
yesterday was Senior Day, 
marking the last home game 
for seniors Emily Peel, Elissa 
Goldner, and Tori Baggio.
The Tartans defeated the 
Brandeis University Judges on 
Friday with a score of 5850, 
making the teams record 
129 and 46 in the University Athletic Association (UAA). 
Senior forward Peels performance was crucial in the 
game as she led the Tartans 
with 21 points. 
At the break, the Tartans 
were up ?ve points, and their 
lead continued throughout 
the second half. Peel shot seven for eight in the ?rst half for 
a total of 17 points. 
When Brandeis took the 
lead, Peel scored seven points 
to put the Tartans back ahead 
139 with around 40 minutes 
left on the clock. The Tartans shot 43.3 percent on the 
court for the ?rst period and 
forced the Judges into 11 halfturnovers the same period. 
First-year Liza Otto was also a 
key player, scoring 14 points, 
eight rebounds, and four assists, while fellow ?rst-year 
Lindsay Poss scored a total 
of seven points. The Tartans 
scoring percentage in the second half was 38.1 percent, 
outdoing the Judges 36.5 
percent. The Tartans also had 
more rebounds during this 
same period. 
The Carnegie Mellon 
womens team then played 
New York University Violets 
on Sunday and defeated them 
by 20 points with a score of 
7656. This secured Carnegie 
Mellons ?rst winning season 
since 200203. 
At Senior Day yesterday,  
the Tartans celebrated their 
dedicated senior members by 
presenting them with photo 
frames and basketball memorabilia to commemorate their 
careers at Carnegie Mellon. 
Todays game wasnt just 
the last game for the seniors 
to play at Skibo Gym  it was 
the last chance for this unique 
group of girls to play together 
on their home court, Goldner said. Im so proud of the 
way we came together today 
to beat NYU. Its experiences 
like todays game that I will 
remember for the rest of my 
life.
The Tartans ?nished with 
a 139 record and a 56 record in the UAA. Peel, again, 
was a huge contribution to the 
Tartans success as she scored 
14 points. Poss also was a key 
player and contributed to the 
win with 13 points and 10 
rebounds. At the break, the 
Tartans led by 14 points with 
a shooting percentage of 47.1 
percent. 
In the game-opening 91 
run, Peel assisted in scoring 
four points after Otto started 
the game with a layup. The 
Tartans never fell behind as 
they had a 259 lead in the 
?rst period. Sophomore guard 
Chandler Cau?eld and sophomore guard Gabrielle West 
each had three pointers to 
continue the Tartans lead. 
In the second half, Peel, 
Otto, and Poss each shot 
baskets to give the Tartans a 
whopping 6020 lead that 
secured a win. West ?nished 
with 13 points, making her 
just a mere two shots away 
from becoming fourth on 
Carnegie Mellons career-high 
scoring chart.
[The wins] felt awesome! 
It was great to see everything 
come together after all of the 
hard work our team has put 
in throughout the season. We 
played together defensively 
and offensively, Peel said. I 
am so happy to have won, but 
I am really looking forward to 
our next three games, we still 
have a lot to get done. 
The Carnegie Mellon womens team will travel to the 
University of Rochester on Friday for the ?rst of three ?nal 
UAA games.

You may have seen ?rstyear electrical and computer 
engineering major Shepard 
Emerson merrily biking 
around campus. However, you 
may not have seen him swiftly 
skiing down the slopes at the 
speed of light, barely visible.
The ?rst-year athlete is the 
top male skier for the Carnegie 
Mellon Ski & Snowboard Club 
this season. He also placed 
second in a slalom race in Elk 
Mountain on Jan. 26 and a 
race in Blue Knob on Jan. 19 
among some of the top skiers 
in the nation, including members of the very competitive 
Pennsylvania State University 
and United States Naval Academy teams.
Ive been pleased with the 
results so far. Ive faced some 
really good competition with 
Penn State and Navy, but Ive 
shown that I can compete with 
the best of them, Emerson 
said.
Emerson is certainly no 
stranger to the slopes. He has 
been skiing since he was four 
years old and racing since he 
was 10. Hailing from Norwich, Vt., there was no shortage of great off-trail skiing 
and mountains for Emerson 
growing up.
In 2008, Emerson made it 
to the Amateur Athletic Union 
(AAU) Junior Olympics in skiing, competing with the best 
skiers in the East, and ?nishing in the top half. Although 
he took a year-long hiatus 
from skiing his senior year of 
high school, Emerson now 
aims to get back into it and 
race for fun, and race to win.
But Emersons desire to 
win is equally matched by his 
support for his teammates. 
Hes very upbeat and supportive. Hes very helpful at 
giving advice to the less experienced skiers, club president 
Anna Cederquist said.
From the beginning, Emerson fell in love with the freedom of being on the mountain.
Im a complete adrenaline 
junkie. I just love going as fast 
as I possibly can, he said.
Emerson satis?es his need 
for adrenaline and outdoor 
adventure not only by skiing, 
but also by rock climbing, running, and biking with Carnegie Mellons Cycling Club.
All of these adventures provide Emerson with a welcome 
distraction from his demanding coursework in the electrical and computer engineering 
curriculum.
Emerson said that being a 
member of Carnegie Mellons 
ski team provides him with 
opportunities to get away 
from the city for the weekend, 
hang with a great group of 
people, and come back feeling 
refreshed.
For now, Emerson has 
his sights set on racing, with 
hopes of qualifying for Nationals.
I think that Shepard 
will keep doing extremely 
well and stay involved in the 
team, Cederquist said. Hes 
de?nitely someone everyone 
can cheer for.

The Tartans went 11 in 
its ?nal home weekend game 
against Brandeis University 
and New York University. This 
brings their overall record to 
517 and 29 in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
conference.
Friday night, the Tartans 
battled the Judges of Brandeis 
University in the Skibo gym. 
The Tartans came out a little 
sluggish at the beginning of 
the game when Brandeis took 
a 92 lead within the ?rst 
three minutes of play.
As the game continued and 
the home team got settled, 
the Tartans were able to work 
their way back into the game 
and cut the de?cit to one 
point after junior guard Asad 
Meghani hit a three pointer to 
re?ect a scoreboard of 1615 
with 13 minutes to go in the 
?rst half.
Just after the 10-minute 
mark, the Tartans scored seven straight points to take the 
lead for the rest of the half. As 
the game progressed, the Tartans continued to pull away 
with great offense, leading 
to more three pointers from 
Meghani and senior guard Andre Moore.
The Tartans led by 12 
with just over three minutes 
left to play in the game when 
Brandeis went on an 184 run 
to regain the lead and eventually win the game with a ?nal 
score of 7368. 
The Tartans played their 
last home game Sunday afternoon, defeating the Violets of 
New York University. At the 
sound of the ?rst buzzer the 
Tartans maintained a narrow 
lead until four minutes into 
the second half when sophomore Jasen Blakney ?nished a 
layup to take his teams lead to 
nine points.
Soon after the layup, the 
Violets made an 112 run to 
tie the game with 10 minutes 
to go. The game stayed very 
close with a 5655 lead for the 
Tartans with 26 seconds left in 
the game and a ?nal possession for the Violets. With the 
clock running down, and the 
ball in the hands of a Violet 
forward right underneath the 
basket, junior forward Sean 
Brophy stole the ball just before the clock ran out and secured the win for the Tartans. 
After re?ecting on his last 
home game as a Tartan, Moore 
said, Its kind of bittersweet 
knowing that was my last 
game at Skibo. Even though I 
wasnt hitting shots, my teammates stepped up and I cant 
thank them enough for sending me out on a win. Moore 
is the Tartans only senior this 
year.
On Friday, the Tartans will 
travel to Rochester to face the 
University of Rochester Yellowjackets.
My teammates 
stepped up and 
I cant thank 
them enough 
for the win.
Andre Moore
Senior guard

Cheap dates for your Valentine
Celebrate Valentines Day on a college-student budget
Valentines Day is the one special day of the year 
when its socially acceptable to shower a loved 
one with extravagant displays of public affection. 
However, because were poor college students, it 
can be hard to find creative (but cheap!) ways to 
show your love. Weve come up with a list of ideas 
of epic things to do on Feb. 14 that wont break the 
bank.
1. Phipps Conservatory is a great idea for newer 
couples. With beautiful flower displays and free 
admission for Carnegie Mellon students, its 
a cute way to get to know someone without 
cleaning out your wallet. 
2. For the more adventurous, outside-the-box 
couple, the Mattress Factory is a great option. 
The museum, which showcases contemporary 
installation art in the Mexican War Streets, has 
many interesting art displays, and admission 
is free for Carnegie Mellon students. James 
Turrells Pleiades is a special highlight  an 
installation in which you can sit with your 
significant other in the dark for 10 minutes. 
3. To take a page out of A Walk to Remember, a 
picnic is a classic Valentines date. Make sure 
to pack your significant others favorite food, a 
towel to sit on, and some blankets to cuddle in. 
Dont forget to bundle up; its cold outside! For 
bonus points, bring a telescope and a star map 
to stargaze. 
4. For the most chick-flick-come-to-life date, 
try ice skating in Schenley Park at night. Its 
a classic for a reason. Not only will it be cold 
(ensuring hand-holding), but the park will also 
have a special deal for the night. The entrance 
fee will be a mere $4 for the two of you, and 
although skate rentals are not included in 
that entrance fee, chocolates, roses, and minimassages are included if youre one of the first 
175 couples there. 
5. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium is a great 
destination for people who arent looking for 
a super intimate date. In fact, its perfect for 
a double date, or even a group of friends. For 
$10 per person, you can explore seven different 
kinds of animal habitats. Just make sure to plan  
for a couple of hours in your schedule so you 
can explore the entire zoo during your visit. 
6. The Double Wide Grill at 2339 E. Carson St. is 
a great place to bring someone for a unique 
date; the restaurant is having a special zombie 
Valentines Day dinner. The average price per 
person ranges from $11 to $30, making this 
the priciest option on our list. But a zombie 
Valentines dinner is too fun to pass up. Make 
sure to dress to impress (the dead), and have a 
good time. 
7. For students who have too much work, try a 
study date at Club Hunt. It might not be the 
most exciting option, but hey, at least you can 
finish that 251 homework! Just make sure to 
bring some flowers or chocolates to still make 
your study buddy feel special. 
8. And last but not least, the forever-alone date is 
always an option. If you dont have a significant 
other this Valentines Day, you can always buy 
plenty of chocolates, order Vocellis, and rent 
out some chick flicks. Invite some friends over 
and make fun night out of it!

Awkward advice for people
Dear Patrick,
My roommate never 
leaves the room. I mean 
never. I cant masturbate 
in the bathroom because I 
live in Stever and we have 
communal bathrooms. 
My grades are dropping 
because all I can think 
about is masturbating. 
Do you have any 
recommendations on 
where I can get a fix? 
Im thinking about Wean 
because I think thats 
more isolated. Help a 
brother get his nut.
Thanks,
Cohabitant Here, I Cant 
Keep Enjoying Nothing, 
Cant Handle Ordeal, 
Kinky Eroticism Required
Dear CHICKEN CHOKER,
First, thank you for writing 
in! I havent gotten a real 
question in two years, so 
this is a real treat for me! My 
first advice would be to try to 
go home with a girl (or boy) 
at a party. But if you do, try 
not to make your desperate 
need for sex sound like 
youre a drug addict (Get a 
fix? Seriously?). Thats a real 
turnoff.
You shouldnt masturbate in 
public, but there are a lot of 
good places on campus to 
masturbate. Just try to go at 
night. The bathrooms in the 
bowels of Wean are always 
empty, although it does 
feel like youre in a leaking 
submarine. Just remember 
to wear headphones if you 
bring your laptop in.
Theres a reason everyone 
wears flipflops in the 
showers,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
My roommate cant stop 
masturbating! Ill walk 
out of the room for two 
seconds, and by the time 
I get back he has one 
hand in his pants and 
unspeakable things on his 
laptop. Our whole room is 
sticky. I came home from 
class early one day, and 
he made me wait outside 
until he finished. How can 
I get him to stop? Or at 
least control himself?
Thanks,
Mates Obstinate 
Nethers Keep Engaging, 
Yet Solitude Lacking 
And Puissant Privates 
Entertained Daily
Dear MONKEY SLAPPED,
This isnt a real question, so 
I dont have to answer it, but 
I might as well stick with this 
weeks theme. First, invest in 
some wet wipes. Just give 
your whole room a rub-down 
when you come home for 
the day. Once youre done, 
why dont you give your 
roommate a copy of this 
column? That way hell know 
where he can go to do his 
duty.
If he still insists on using 
your room, try getting him 
to use the old sock-on-thedoorknob trick so at least 
you wont walk in on him. 
You could also try getting 
him a girlfriend. Im sure any 
woman would be impressed 
by how soft his hands are.
Or just douse him in cold 
water,
Patrick Hoskins

The glum shoegazers that make up indie pop band 
Veronica Falls return tomorrow with their sophomore 
album installation, Waiting for Something to Happen. 
The newest release is certainly a ray of sunshine in one 
of the years darkest months, suffused with jangling 
guitars, ?owing harmonies, and bittersweet hooks.
Veronica Falls Waiting for Something to Happen is a 
euphoric departure from the brooding, punk-inspired 
tropes of Right Side of My Brain and Beachy 
Feeling, songs from the bands 2011 self-titled album. 
Instead, it is a more polished and pop-inspired iteration 
of the last record, showing the bands evolution into a 
more poised and con?dent entity.
The albums emotional motif is one of coming to terms 
with growing up; the lyrics obsess over lost love and 
loneliness. Teenage  possibly the best song on the 
album  captures the fear and wonder we feel before 
we understand how ?eeting young love can be. The 
song begins harmlessly enough, as Roxanne Clifford 
and James Hoare share lead vocals and a late-night 
ride. Melodic guitars and a driving rhythm section 
propel the couple through a lighter ?rst verse, yet 
darkness dips in during the chorus. Driving late at 
night, Ill let you listen to the music you like, Clifford 
croons, adding that she is searching for a shooting star 
to point [her] in the right direction.
Far from retreading the playful atmosphere of the debut, 
the band mines a richer, more emotionally resonant 
vein. Waiting for Something to Happen is weary with 
dead-end social scenes (So Tired) and the fear of your 
peers leaving you behind (Everybodys Changing). In 
its entirety, the album embodies more achingly tender 
messages, from the touching love song Broken Toy (I 
am broken, a broken toy like you), to the gentle reverie 
Daniel, which strips the track to its bare essentials: 
shimmering guitar lines and perfectly harmonized 
vocals. Thematically, the album is a success in its 
portrayal of the advent of adulthood: Its sense of 
uncertainty is palpable.
Musically, the album is more self-assured than 
Veronica Falls last album. The opener, Tell Me, is 
representative of the releases more muscular melodies. 
Buried Alive and My Heart Beats are similarly 
robust, featuring skewed drum beats and catchy vocals. 
Here, the band seems to fall somewhere in between 
the suburban surfer rock of bands like The Drums and 
the dreamy pop of The Dum Dum Girls. While Veronica 
Falls has retreated from its lo-? roots, it has achieved 
the ranks of like-minded upbeat indie bands. Musical 
references to 1980s London nostalgia  including The 
Velvet Underground, The Pastels, and Echobelly  are 
so skillful that the songs, though not unlike London rock 
we have heard before, do not tire.
This most recent installation is enduring. Undoubtedly, 
Veronica Falls can stake its claim as one of the most 
gloriously unpredictable and invaluable bands the U.K. 
has right now.

Walk the Moon creates lively atmosphere
Despite awkward age disparity in audience, indie rock band invites listeners to let loose
Cincinnati-based band Walk the Moon performed at the 
Altar Bar in the Strip District last Wednesday. Noted 
for its indie pop and its hit Anna Sun, the band is no 
stranger to Pittsburgh or the Altar Bar  it opened for 
Neon Trees last August. Even for moderate fans, the 
show fostered an appreciation for what Walk the Moon 
tries to do: create a fun performance.
Similar to Mr. Smalls Theatre, another local tour stop for 
bands, the Altar Bar serves as a good location for smaller 
bands. The Altar Bar, a renovated church-turned-concert 
venue, provides both a sense of history as well as an 
intimacy you lose in other, larger locations.
Unlike Mr. Smalls, however, the Altar Bar is more 
accessible and easier to get to for young concert-goers. 
A majority of the crowd seemed to be high-school 
students, while the 21-and-over section seemed to be 
occupied by their parents. While this isnt a bad thing 
in and of itself, having a noticeable age gap among the 
audience can be distracting.
The show started with Paci?c Air, a Southern Californiabased band fronted by brothers Ryan and Taylor Lawhon. 
Similar to Walk the Moon, the band seemed to work 
in the indie pop genre. Singer Ryan Lawhons initial 
request that everyone get sexy was slightly awkward, 
considering that many people in the audience were 
either minors or adults bordering on menopause.
Paci?c Airs song Float stood out the most, with 
a catchy hook of whistling and a sing-along tune. 
However, the rest of the performance wasnt original 
enough to be memorable. Ryan Lawhon had a swagger 
and style that was entertaining to watch, but for the 
most part, there was a lack of energy in the crowd 
throughout the opening act. The music sounded ?ne, but 
the lack of a distinct sound made it hard for the band to 
stand out.
This apathy ended when Walk the Moon took the stage 
after a short recording of Gene Wilders performance 
of Pure Imagination from the ?lm Willy Wonka & the 
Chocolate Factory. Performing two of the bands most 
popular and up-tempo songs right off the bat  Next in 
Line and Tightrope  was a smart choice, infusing 
the crowd with a liveliness that was previously missing. 
Singer Nicholas Petriccas frantic use of the bass drum 
and energetic shouts really helped kick off the show.
The performance continued at this pace for much of 
the show. It did noticeably die down, however, with the 
bands performance of Iscariot, the slowest song of 
their debut, self-titled album. While its a beautiful track, 
and the slower pace was a welcome change from the 
energetic and sweaty ambience of the show, it was a 
jarring shift. Almost lullaby-like, the song felt out of place 
in an otherwise fun show.
That sense of fun, however, is exactly what the audience 
took away. Not only did the crowd enjoy the upbeat 
rhythm and tone of the songs, the band members, too, 
were visibly enjoying themselves. It was clear how 
much fun the members of Walk the Moon were having 
on stage, and how much they appreciated the chance 
to perform. Their rapport with the crowd was especially 
evident in their pre-encore performance of their most 
popular song Anna Sun; guitarist Eli Maiman had 
a huge smile on his face at the close of the song, 
repeatedly mouthing thank you to the crowd.
Little things like that really drove the atmosphere of the 
show home. Walk the Moon isnt a serious band, and the 
members arent doing anything truly unique musically 
or performance-wise. Yet they excel at creating an 
environment where people can let loose and enjoy 
themselves  even if their parents are watching from 
the bar.

Just over 25 years ago, a game called Final Fantasy 
appeared on store shelves in Japan for the Famicom 
(known to us as the Nintendo Entertainment System, or 
NES). According to an interview in Beyond Final Fantasy 
 a bonus DVD from European versions of Final Fantasy 
X  the games creator, Hironobu Sakaguchi, truly 
believed it would be the last game he would ever make: 
hence, the ominous name. What he did not anticipate, 
however, was that Final Fantasy would be a gigantic 
hit, taking the video game world by storm and doing 
extremely well in both Japan and North America, where 
it was released almost three years later.
The game was ?rst proposed around the time the 
original Dragon Quest was released; it had demonstrated 
that role-playing games could sell well. Its success was 
so great that a myth began circulating that after the 
third game in the series was released, Japan had to pass 
a law that Dragon Quest games could only be sold on 
weekends or holidays, because so many people were 
skipping school and work to stand in lines to purchase 
the games.
Mainly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, Sakaguchi and 
his team wanted to make the then-standard of turnbased RPGs as close to Western pen-and-paper RPGs as 
possible, according to an interview with 1up.com. This 
meant introducing enemies with speci?c weaknesses, 
something the genre had long ignored. The game also 
allowed players to choose speci?c members of their fourperson parties from a list of six different types: warrior, 
thief, black mage, white mage, red mage, and monk. The 
players therefore had much more control over their fates 
than in any other game before  a fate that could spell 
certain death if players chose their parties unwisely. 
It also allowed the player to see his party at all times, 
taking a third-person view in battles when the norm 
at the time was to switch to ?rst-person during enemy 
encounters.
After the game did surprisingly well in both the 
Japanese and North American markets, video game 
developer Square (now known as Square Enix, after 
merging with Enix in 2003) naturally wanted to continue 
the series. Fourteen main-series and 32 spinoff games 
later, the Final Fantasy series continues to push and 
introduce new concepts to a genre that could have died 
off long ago  something it has done since inception. 
With Final Fantasy III came the job system, a tool with 
which players could change their characters types to 
allow for more diverse, complex, and powerful characters 
that were truly unique to the player. Final Fantasy IV 
was the ?rst game to turn away from the classic chosen 
hero story formula and presented a truly compelling plot 
and backstory, something that has continued throughout 
the rest of the series  except perhaps in Final Fantasy 
V.
Final Fantasy VII brought the series into the third 
dimension on PlayStation and further developed 
amazingly deep story lines. The game featured internal 
mini-games that, unlike many games of the time, were 
somewhat enjoyable. With every new arrival of the 
series, Final Fantasy pushed and broke the boundaries 
and preconceptions of what an RPG was and could be.
This is not to say the series is without fault. The most 
recent addition to the spinoff collection, Final Fantasy 
All the Bravest for iOS, is an absolute abomination. The 
premise is simple: The players control a horde of heroes 
from the series and battle a horde of enemies. And thats 
all there is. With the swipe a ?nger, every character that 
the player touches attacks. So wheres the appeal? The 
only really new element is that the characters from 
the 3-D games have been grotesquely turned into 32-bit 
representations of themselves.
However, in order to unlock any of the more famous and 
recognizable characters, one must pay an additional cost 
(something to the tune of $1 per character)  and thats 
just for a random character. If this isnt a clear example 
of whats wrong with the gaming industry, I dont know 
what is. The new sprites of the characters and locations 
in 32 bits is a little cool, but thats as far as Im willing to 
go with praise for this game (especially because its clear 
that the characters are not much more than recolored 
versions of each other).
The most recent blunder aside, the Final Fantasy series 
is a great beacon for others to aspire to. Some argue that 
the quality of the games has been dropping in recent 
years. However, I attribute this to the nostalgia factor: 
People view the games they grew up with as intrinsically 
better, much the same way I prefer A New Hope to 
Empire Strikes Back, even though the latter is clearly the 
better Star Wars ?lm. Final Fantasy was the series that 
brought RPGs to the West, and for that alone it should 
always be held in high esteem, aside from being one of 
the greatest video game series ever made.

The Final Fantasy series excels in its ability to mold deep, diverse, and complex character types, each unique to the player who creates them.

music
pillbox 02.11.137
The Carnegie Mellon School of Music kicked off its 
Brown Bag Chamber Music Concert series last Tuesday 
with the one sound Carnegie Mellon students just cant 
seem to get enough of: the wail of bagpipes. Students, 
faculty, and any others who want to listen to some 
top-notch music while snacking or eating their lunches 
are invited to the concerts, which will take place in 
McConomy Auditorium at noon every Tuesday through 
March 12.
The concerts are an informal and (best of all) free way 
to reap some of the bene?ts of being on a campus 
brimming with so much talent. The performance opened 
with a number of bagpipe tunes by masters student 
in bagpipe performance Andrew Bova  everything 
from marches to folksy jigs rooted in tales of one-eyed 
wives, 200-year-old feuds, and a lot of characters with 
the pre?x Mc attached to their surnames. The sound of 
the pipes managed to cut above the hustle and bustle of 
the Employment Opportunities Conference outside the 
auditorium, as numerous heads popped in to investigate 
the source of that piece of Scottish heritage Carnegie 
Mellon holds so dear.
To make a point of the diversity of music one can expect 
to hear at these concerts, the second of the two acts on 
the bill changed gears dramatically: After 20 minutes of 
bagpipes, the program continued with masters student 
in violin performance Xiowan Wu and masters student 
in viola performance Rui Li playing a Mozart duet. The 
beautiful and gentle notes ?owed out of the strings 
seamlessly, ?lling the room with a sound so full that any 
kind of alien noise (such as me unzipping my backpack) 
immediately stood out.
Its always amazing that some individuals can really rock 
out whilst playing classical violin. Although they never 
quite reached the same intensity as a 16-year-old in his 
garage, or the energy of a performer like Mick Jagger, 
these two masters students swayed their bodies to the 
swirl of the music and became completely engrossed 
in it. Thats just the kind of thing that Carnegie Mellon 
students project: a mix of technical precision and good, 
old-fashioned passion for what theyre doing.
So if youre looking to whet your musical whistle,  
support your classmates, or just listen to music while you 
chill and eat some lunch with friends, check out future 
events in the Brown Bag Chamber Music Concert series. 
Theres no guarantee that each performance will be as 
good as the ?rst, but based on this strong opening, we 
can only expect good things.

Much has been said about The Master. Advertised 
as a Scientology expos, audiences were startled to 
?nd a dense, demanding character study. Joaquin 
Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are at the center 
of this ?lm, playing an emotionally battered WWII vet 
and a charismatic cult leader, respectively, who enter 
into a deeply complicated relationship. Director Paul 
Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest living cinematic 
maestros; he created the masterpieces There Will Be 
Blood, Boogie Nights, and Punch-Drunk Love, all before 
his 40th birthday. The Master is a harrowing experiment 
that displays utterly electric cinematic force. Anderson 
continues his deconstruction of 20th-century America 
with one of the ?ve best ?lms of 2012  a must-see.

Anyone who has read the novel upon which this ?lm is 
based will attest to its seemingly un?lmable structure 
and aesthetic. But how do we get a tiger in that little 
boat? they asked. CGI, I guess, replied some savvy 
studio executive. CGI, indeed. Life of Pi gives us an 
excruciatingly boring story mixed with some of the most 
unthinkably spectacular visual creativity. Director Ang 
Lee (Brokeback Mountain, Crouching Tiger, and Hidden 
Dragon) crafts the last 40 minutes of this ?lm in an 
uncommon display of computer-generated spectacle. 
While the ?lm hasnt done particularly well in the 
American market, it is setting international records.
Flight
Sunday, Feb. 17
7:30 10 12:30
Denzel Washington turns in another admirable 
performance in this frustrating picture. He plays airline 
captain William Whip Whitaker, a pilot struggling 
with alcoholism and cocaine addiction. The ?lm 
suggests an interesting premise  that we would 
rather be in a plane piloted by a cocaine-addicted 
but controlled drunk than by a sober, panicky stickler. 
But Flight is primarily concerned with punishing Whip 
for his addiction. Still, the movie contains one of the 
most exciting and excellent scenes of last year and 
a seriously convincing performance of oft-explored 
material by one of our greatest living actors.

Dessert Dip
Adapted from eat-yourself-skinny.com.
1 box of cake mix (my favorite is Funfetti)
2 cups of vanilla yogurt
1 cup of Cool Whip
Dip vehicles: animal crackers, graham crackers, or fruit, if youre being healthy.
Mix it all together and prepare to die of dip happiness. Fair warning: This makes a 
ton of dip  like an entire mixing bowl. I hope youre either searching for the cure 
for the everyday blues or inviting your entire ?oor to dessert.
Butter Pecan Miracles
They really are miracles for your taste buds. Adapted from tasteofhome.com.
1 box of butter pecan cake mix
1 teaspoon of vanilla
2 eggs
 cup of butter, softened
1 cup of chocolate or butterscotch chips
Preheat the oven to 350F. Cream the butter, eggs, and vanilla. Add half of the cake 
mix with the electric mixer, then mix the rest of it in by hand. Stir in the chips, then 
use two spoons to scoop onto the cookie tray. The batter will be very sticky. Bake for

Cake mix is the bane of bakers everywhere. Its a miracle when youre in a pinch, when 
youre feeling lazy, or when youre just absolutely craving that from-a-box taste that 
nobody should like but almost everyone actually does.
But when you use a cake mix just to make a cake, something inside you dies a little bit. 
The little baker inside you who serves as your baking Jiminy Cricket sits down and puts 
his head in his hands and sobs. Isnt there a compromise  something that can make 
everyone happy?
Of course there is. In fact, there are a lot of options. So without further ado, heres 
a selection of recipes that uses cake mix in unexpected ways to make something 
fabulous, even more so.
Cake Mix Cake: Enhanced Version 
You might be skeptical, but you wont believe how much more delicious and homemade 
this version tastes.
1 box of cake mix
1 teaspoon of vanilla
3 eggs
 cup of vegetable or canola oil (or applesauce as a low-fat option)
1 cup of milk
Instead of the cup of water that the directions indicate, use a cup of milk. Bake 
according to the directions on the mixs box and marvel at your amazing skill.

Cake Mix Truf?es
Adapted from loveveggiesandyoga.com.
1 cup of cake mix
 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon of vanilla
Mix the ingredients together in a bowl and use your palms to roll the mix into one-inch 
balls. Put them on a tray and refrigerate for an hour or two. At this point, if you have the 
patience of a saint, you can roll the truf?es in the melted chocolate and refrigerate them 
again.
Cake Batter Milkshakes
You need these now. I dont care how cold it is. Adapted from abeautifulmess.com.
1 box of cake mix (my favorites are red velvet and Funfetti)
45 cups of milk
45 scoops of ice cream (feel free to go crazy with your ?avors here)
Throw it all in a blender and ?nd a straw. A big one.
Funfetti Pancakes
Adapted from wifessionoals.com.
1 cups of Funfetti cake mix
2 tablespoons of oil
 cup of milk
1 egg
Mix together until bubbles form. Butter a skillet and heat the mixture over medium-low 
heat. Cook small pancakes for no longer than three minutes on each side. You have 
to watch these guys pretty closely to make sure they dont burn. If you want the true 
breakfast of champions, top these babies with a glaze by microwaving Funfetti icing 
and milk until the texture is smooth.
It might look the same as its humdrum cousin from a box, but this fixer-upper cake 
will have people asking for your homemade cake recipe. Preheat the oven to 350F. Mix the cake mix, oil, and egg, then pat into a greased 9-by13-inch pan. Bake for 15 minutes. In the meantime, beat together the lemon juice, cream 
cheese, and sugar. After the cake has baked for the initial 15 minutes, spread the cream 
cheese mixture smoothly over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes, then slice into bars. 
Normally, I dont go for refrigeration of baked goods, but a few hours in the refrigerator takes 
this recipe to a higher level. Its your call. No, I take it back: Its a test of your patience and 
restraint.
Fruit and Soda Cobbler
Adapted from livingachangedlife.blogspot.com.
24 ounces of fruit (mixed berries are my favorite, but peaches also work)
1 box of vanilla or yellow cake mix
12 cans of lemon-lime soda
Preheat the oven to 350F. Spread the fruit on the bottom of a greased 9-by-13-inch pan. Pour 
the cake mix evenly on top, but dont mix it in. Then, pour a can of soda over the the cake 
mix; dont mix that in either. You may need more than one can in order to avoid dry spots. 
Bake for 45-50 minutes, and then dig in with a spoon. To avoid the inevitable burning of your 
tongue, you can always top the cobbler with ice cream.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes
1 box of yellow cake mix
3 eggs
1/3 cup of vegetable oil
2 cups of canned pumpkin
2 tablespoons of water
1 can of vanilla icing
1 teaspoon of cinnamon, plus additional for topping
1 teaspoon of ginger, plus additional for topping
Preheat the oven to 350F. Mix the cake mix, eggs, oil, spices, and pumpkin. Add the water 
until the mix is smooth but not watery. Pour the mix into greased cupcake tins, ?lling them 
about three-fourths of the way. Bake for 1820 minutes or until golden brown. Once theyre 
cooled, spread the vanilla icing on top. If youre feeling particularly artsy or Julia Child-esque, 
sprinkle cinnamon and ginger on top.

Video performance artist and Carnegie Mellon 
alumna Shana Moulton (CFA 04) creates kitschy 
and endearing work with a poppy aesthetic that 
contradicts its exploration of the hopelessness of the 
individual. As the ?rst speaker of the 2013 School 
of Art Spring Lecture Series, Moulton spoke of her 
experiences both at Carnegie Mellon and after 
graduation, as well as her current work at the Andy 
Warhol Museum.
Moultons work is largely based on a ?ctional 
character formulated in her graduate years spent 
at Carnegie Mellon, named Cynthia. Cynthia is 
a hypochondriac and an agoraphobiac, stuck in 
endless delusional attempts to ?nd comfort while 
being plagued by technicolor hallucinations. 
Cynthias environment is clean, loaded with pastelcolored products, and coated in false hope. Her 
series of videos  entitled Whispering Pines after 
the mobile home she grew up in  follow Cynthia in 
her quest to ?nd ful?llment in all the wrong places: 
cheap as-seen-on-TV beauty products, fad diets, 
and televised wonders like The Antiques Roadshow.
Moulton began the talk with a walk down 
memory lane; she explained how the medicalinspired garments she made as a masters student 
at Carnegie Mellon in?uenced the creation of 
Cynthia. She explained that, after creating a dress 
with a hemorrhoid pillow built in, she wondered 
what sort of character would wear this dress, and, 
subsequently, concocted Cynthia. After graduation, 
she spent two years abroad in an artist residency in 
Amsterdam, where Cynthias videos began to take 
shape, mirroring Moultons familys experiences, 
such as her mothers sleep terrors, a result of 
chemicals in arti?cial sweeteners.
Moulton showed two full seven-and-a-half-minute 
videos in her talk, as well as clips from several 
others, allowing the work to speak for itself. The 
presentation concluded in her reading an excerpt 
from an author who had reviewed her work, 
because, as she claimed, Im terrible at summing it 
up myself.
The videos rely largely on strange after-effect 
elements, creating a trippy, kitschy aesthetic. Many 
ended with Cynthia doing a strange, rave-type 
dance, often with body parts superimposed with 
tye-die and spiral designs. I use dance a lot as a 
kind of ultimate experience, Moulton explained, 
laughing at how two of the clips she showed ended 
this way. I dont always dance at the end of my 
videos.
Moulton was not a dynamic speaker, but her use 
of video and documentation made for a dynamic 
presentation. The Whispering Pines saga played 
on familiar tasteless products, like medication for 
Restless Leg Syndrome, Crystal Light, and other 
televised promises of comfort for the American 
home. The videos have a sad, ironic humor, ending 
in the realization that Cynthias wants, health, and 
spiritual desires are relatively obsolete; these are 
mirrored in the videos endings, with Cynthia feeling 
relatively unful?lled or lacking the results that these 
products promised.
Recently, Moulton has begun using her body with 
several projections of the Whispering Pines world 
to create an interactive performance as Cynthia. On 
Friday she made an appearance at the Andy Warhol 
Museum for Whispering Pines 10, a one-act opera 
created by Moulton in collaboration with composer 
Nick Hallett and featuring vocalist Daisy Press.

Feminist and...The Mattress Factory. Through May 26.
This exhibit features works by six female artists from 
around the world, aiming to show that feminism is a 
multivocal, multigenerational, and multicultural movement, 
not a single-issue set of political beliefs. The exhibit was 
guest-curated by Hilary Robinson, a former professor of 
art theory and criticism at Carnegie Mellon.
