Pittsburgh mourns Mayor OConnors death
by Justine Rae Lee
Staffwriter
It has been five years since Septem
ber 11 became more than a date. Since 
then, former students have gathered 
in unity on campus, and current stu
dents have united in remembrance of 
the event of their generation. Today, to 
commemorate the days anniversary, 
students reflect on the way the day 
changed their lives.
Black Tuesday
Junior biology major Abhinav Nafday keeps a Ranch 1 restaurant receipt 
in his wallet. It reads 09/11/01 11:14 
AM. Its his only evidence of having 
lived through that day.
Five years ago, Nafday was a sopho
more at Stuyvesant High School in 
New York City, a block away from the 
World Trade Center. The students were 
given orders to evacuate after the sec
ond tower was hit.
The details are still vivid. There is a 
360-degree panorama that I can refer 
to even now of the collapsing tower, my 
school in the background, and of all the 
frantic people. Just a scene of complete 
madness, Nafday said.
At this point, basic instinct of sur
vival kicked in and Nafday and a group 
of his friends ran uptown. They were 
covered in white dust from the debris, 
but did not look back. They managed 
to make a stop at Ranch 1 on Seventh 
Avenue.
I keep it in my wallet to remind me 
of that crazy journey, Nafday said.
Meanwhile in Pittsburgh, Carnegie 
Mellon students overcome with grief 
and confusion gathered on the Cut 
that Tuesday morning, according to a 
September 17, 2001, article in The Tar

Katrina hits

A stranger passing through the Uni
versity Center last week might have 
seen students clutching beaded neck
laces and wondered if Carnegie Mel
lon was celebrating Mardi Gras early. It 
was no early holiday, though  it was 
the commemoration of the one-year 
anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.
Last week, the Carnegie Mellon Staff 
Council raised money for Beads for Tulane, one of many campus responses 
to Hurricane Katrina, including fund
raisers, housing for displaced students, 
and trips to affected regions since the 
natural disaster last August.
We knew that we wanted to get 
[victims] the money directly, so it 
didnt have to be filtered through the 
Red Cross or United Way. We wanted 
to be able to get the names of individu
als who had a need, said Staff Coun
cil Events & Outreach Task Force chair 
Lindie Droulia.
Staff Council members tabled at vari
ous locations on campus, selling Mardi 
Gras beads for cash that they then used 
to buy $25 gift cards to stores such as 
Wal-Mart and Target. They held their 
first event, which lasted six weeks, last 
spring.
Deciding who would receive them 
was probably our hardest project. We

Gender imbalance

Women take over academics nationally, but not at CMUWoman sues university for gender discrimination
Universitys male-to-female ratio shows women still a minority in overall demographics
by Claire Morgenstern
Assistant News Editor
Across the country, women are ex
celling more than men in higher edu
cation. Currently, women make up 58 
percent of the nations college students, 
according to a July 9 article in The New 
York Times.
So why has Carnegie Mellons under
graduate female population been hov
ering at 40 percent for the last several 
years?
Though U.S. News & World Reports 
2007 edition of Americas Best Col
leges ranked Carnegie Mellon eighth 
on its list of best undergraduate engi
neering programs at schools with doc
toral programs, the university had the 
second-lowest percentage of women 
out of the first 20 schools on the list. In 
other words, aspiring female engineers 
are choosing to enroll at competing 
universities more often than they are at 
Carnegie Mellon.
This scenario contrast strongly with 
national and local data. A special report 
from 2004 by The Chronicle of Higher 
Education found that in 2001-2002, 
American women received a greater 
share of the doctorates earned in the 
United States than men.
And according to a March 21 Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette article, women lead 
four of the regions universities  Carlow University, LaRoche College, Seton 
Hill College, and Washington & Jef
ferson College  and are CEOs of five 
UPMC hospitals.
Professors and administrators arent
sure why Carnegie Mellon defies these 
trends.
The requirement that you commit to 
a college before you come is less attrac
tive to women than men, said Allan 
Fisher, former dean for undergraduate 
computer science education and co-au
thor of Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women 
in Computing. This publication summa

Claiming both racial and gender dis
crimination, a former research scientist 
at Carnegie Mellon filed a federal law
suit against the University on August

(ECE) department in 1997, argues she

born white woman.
In addition to Carnegie Mellon, Pauls 
suit names Pradeep Khosla, dean of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, and 
Vijayakumar Bhagavatula, acting ECE 
department head, as defendants.
Pauls suit invokes Title IX of the Ed
ucation Amendments of 1972, which 
provides protection against gender dis
crimination.
The complaint notes that, when she 
was hired in 1997, Paul was the only 
female faculty member in the ECE de
partment. The following year, a non
tenured ECE faculty member made a 
demeaning gender-oriented comment 
about [Pauls] prospects at CMU. Fol
lowing her report of the comment, Paul 
was shunned by colleagues in the 
Center for Silicon System Implementa
tion (CSSI) and excluded from meet
ings with potential research sponsors, 
according to the suit.
The suit names Larry Pileggi, head 
of CSSI and faculty member in the ECE 
department, as particularly biased. Pileggi was prejudiced against Paul due 
to her gender and due to the fact that 
she was a U.S.-born, white female, the 
complaint states.
Paul was promoted to a non-tenuretrack faculty position as a research 
scientist in 2000. In this position, the 
complaint states, Paul was expected to 
secure grants and other research fund
ing. According to the lawsuit, she re
ceived no support from other ECE fac
ulty, including Khosla, who promoted 
and funded the research of other faculty

Eustace Conway, while Pitt will 
hear author Reza Aslans take 
on the Islamic Reformation 
and begin its World Affairs for 
Beginners lecture series.
This Thursday evening, nat
uralist Eustace Conway will 
speak about his experiences 
in nature and his enthusiasm 
for preserving our environ
ment.
Conways passion for the out
doors has taken him on a re
markable journey. At age 18, he 
began living for what became 
17 years in an Indian tipi. As an 
adult, he hiked the length of the 
Appalachian Trail and set the

Privilege
To love CMU, own 
your experience
/ BrBradford Yankiver
Three of the best decisions Ive ever 
made were coming to Carnegie Mellon, 
leaving Carnegie Mellon  expecting 
never to return  and coming back to 
Carnegie Mellon. Having made that 
rather uncommon sequence of deci
sions, Ive come to understand all that is 
possible at this university. You just need 
to be ready to find what you want and 
then make it yours.
Carnegie Mellon is composed of 
seven colleges, encompassing about 50 
distinct departments and another 20 
interdisciplinary programs. And be
cause of the size and great diversity of 
its programs, Carnegie Mellon is highly 
decentralized.
At the age of 18, many, if not most, 
new students are not sure what they 
want to do 10 years down the road. As 
I did, many worry that they might not 
be in the right department or college 
once classes get underway. Thats when 
Carnegie Mellons size can become ter
ribly overwhelming, and its easy to feel 
lost in the academic labyrinth. The fact 
that each week of school costs about 
$1200 makes being lost even more mis
erable.
I had come to Carnegie Mellon with 
the assumption that I would be a doc
tor. My first-year floor-mates will attest 
that I kept a copy of Grays Anatomy on 
my desk. But when the only connection 
between my first-year biology class and 
a future in medicine was the nosebleed 
I feared I would have when I had to sit 
in the back of the 250-person lecture 
hall, I began to rethink my academic 
plans.
Realizing that the science of medicine 
wasnt my passion was an important 
revelation, but it left me wondering 
why I was chugging along on a pre-med 
path. Since I didnt know what course of 
study I should choose as a replacement, 
I decided that I should find a way to try 
something new outside of the regular 
academic setting.
Though skepticism was my friends 
and familys overwhelming reaction, 
I filed a leave of absence form. My 
academic advisor supported me all the 
way. Dr. Eric Grotzinger was the one 
who kept me from feeling like I was 
committing academic suicide.
A year later, Id spent five months 
in parts of Asia and Africa that few 
Westerners have ever visited, Id worked 
the graveyard shift in an emergency 
room, and Id taken classes at one of 
Bostons finest universities.
After all that, I wanted one thing; I 
wanted to return to Carnegie Mellon.
While I was away, I missed the buzz 
of this place. At all times, someone is 
ready for a real conversation, someone 
is pouring his energy into one of his 
many passions, and someone is creat
ing something new. People at Carnegie 
Mellon are unashamed of non-confor
mity, unlike the people at many other 
top schools. That leaves us with the 
most intellectual, creative, and open 
environment Ive ever experienced at 
an undergraduate institution.
During my year away, my advisor had 
helped me via e-mail to find a number 
of majors that might suit my interests. 
He even entertained a multi-month dia
logue about creating my own major. In 
the end, I chose the existing policy and 
management major with an additional 
major international relations. Moreover, 
Ive since found ways to involve myself 
in the Carnegie Mellon community. 
At The Tartan, as a Student Advisory 
Council member, and as a community 
advisor, Ive found countless ways to 
create an experience that I will carry 
with me for the rest of my life.
And thats the key. Carnegie Mellon 
wont hand you an experience, pre
wrapped like a Sushi Two meal block. 
Youre going have to go out and make it 
for yourself. Youve got to own it.

City looks for guidance from new, 26-year-old mayor
Mayor Bob OConnors funeral procession heads down Fifth Avenue last Thursday.
by Matthew E. Campbell
Staffwriter
Recently in Pittsburgh, politics have been a 
matter of small numbers.
After a brief eight months in office, Pitts
burghs mayor Robert Bob OConnor died 
from a rare form of brain cancer on Septem
ber 1. His death followed a quick illness  he 
was diagnosed just over seven weeks before
hand. Now, Luke Ravenstahl, at a mere 26 
years of age, is the new mayor of Pittsburgh.
OConnor, who hailed from Squirrel Hill, 
was known for the enthusiasm he brought to 
the city. Often called The Peoples Mayor, 
OConnor was known for his Redd Up cam
paign to clean the city.
OConnors funeral was held last Thursday 
at St. Pauls Cathedral in Oakland. Donald 
Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, D.C., and 
former bishop of the Pittsburgh diocese, led 
the mass. Approximately 1800 people at
tended the service.
Ravenstahl has indicated that he will ex
tend OConnors policies. So far Ravenstahl 
has left most of OConnors administration 
in place. But Ravenstahl has a challenging 
task already: The 2007 city budget must be 
submitted to the Act 47 oversight board by 
September 21.
Lawyers have interpreted Pittsburghs 
home rule charter, the document that defines 
the city government, to mean that Ravens
tahl will be able to complete the remaining 
three years of OConnors term. However, the 
language of the charter is somewhat vague, 
and many lawyers expect that there will be 
a special election for a new mayor before 
OConnors four-year term is up.
Historical precedent is against Ravens
tahl serving for three years. In 1988, Sophie 
Masloff, then City Council president, became
mayor after Richard Caliguiri died. An elec
tion was held the following year. However, 
the city charter has been altered since then, 
and it is not clear now whether a new election 
must be held.
The interpretation of the charter that allows 
Ravenstahl to stay in office for OConnors full 
term takes into account the rule that the citys 
mayor and controller should not be elected at 
the same time. The position of controller will 
be up for election in November of 2007, the 
next municipal election.
According to the charter, an elected con
troller is mandated to ensure an independent 
check on the use of city resources and the 
controller shall be chosen by the qualified 
electors of the city at a non-mayoralty mu
nicipal election.
However, Eric Montarti, a policy analyst 
for the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, 
suggested that a special election could be 
held in May 2007, months before the election 
of a controller. He said it was unclear how the 
election might be structured and whether it 
would include primaries by party or if many 
candidates would run as independents.
Ravenstahl has moved quickly to clear up 
the controversy of how long he will be able 
to stay in office. My intention ... is to make 
that decision happen as quickly as possible, 
Ravenstahl said Saturday to the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. The speculation does us no 
good. We need to focus on functioning as a 
city government.
City lawyers are busy addressing the mat
ter.
Ravenstahls political career has been 
short, but he has already reached the heights 
of civil service as mayor of Pittsburgh. At age
23, Ravenstahl was elected to the Pittsburgh 
City Council, representing the North Side. 
Last December 6, Ravenstahl became City 
Council president with the minimum num
Robert Kaminski/Photo Editor
ber of votes.
Despite his youth, Ravenstahl told report
ers he is ready to lead the city. I have been 
the president, I have been elected by my dis
trict, I have been elected by my colleagues, 
he said September 2 to the Post-Gazette, and 
Im more than confident that if and when Im 
called upon, Im here to serve the residents 
of the city.
Robert Strauss, a professor of economics 
and public policy in the Heinz School, com
mented on the state of Pittsburgh: The ba
sic trajectory of the city is fixed, he said. At 
worst, its negative. At best, its level.
Strauss noted that OConnor had good 
ideas and created enthusiasm for Pitts
burgh, adding that the late mayor tried to 
revitalize downtown Pittsburgh. Although 
OConnor had some successes, Strauss said, 
not enough net happened to stop the decline 
[of Pittsburgh].
In general, Strauss feels that the prob
lems of Pittsburgh go beyond the mayor and 
politics to fundamentals. Allegheny County, 
which includes the city of Pittsburgh, is made 
up of 130 municipalities  the most in Penn
sylvania, and second most in the country, ac
cording to Strauss.
Some of the smallest municipalities govern 
fewer than 1000 people, while Pittsburgh 
governs more than 300,000, according to the 
Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission.
Though Pittsburgh has been steadily losing 
population and has suffered from a shrink
ing tax base, the city has amassed a signifi
cant amount of debt. According to the Act 47 
board, a state oversight board supervising 
Pittsburghs recovery from its distressed 
status, in 2002 debt service represented 16.3 
percent of total operating expenditures.
Until theres fundamental change, Mon
tarti said, Pittsburghs going to stay the 
same.
University remembers 
Heinz School professor
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
One of the founding fathers of 
the Heinz School of Public Policy 
and Management, Otto Toby 
Davis was a renowned scholar 
of economics. But since his death 
last May, his colleagues have 
remembered him as a guardian 
angel.
This Saturday, students, fac
ulty, and friends are celebrating 
the life of man as well known 
for his academic contributions 
as he is for his humanitarian 
outreach.
Davis came to Carnegie Tech
nical Institute, now Carnegie 
Mellon, in 1960 and began devel
oping a model for a school that 
would deal with urban issues. 
Eight years later, Davis and col
league William Cooper proposed 
the School of Urban and Public 
Affairs. SUPA, as the school was 
called, came to fruition after the 
financial backing of a $10 mil
lion grant from the Richard King 
Mellon Foundation. The school 
was later named for the late Sen
ator H. John Heinz III.
He was remarkably under
stated with a profound curiousity about how the world works 
and a lifelong interest in ideas 
and the chemistry of people 
who work together to develop 
ideas, stated Robert Strauss, 
professor of economics and pub
lic policy in the Heinz School 
and close friend and colleague 
of Davis.
He was also remarkably cre
ative in solving complex prob
lems and had a laser kind of 
mind that put things in perspec
tive in the most simple and intui
tive ways.
Davis launched SUPAs Center 
for Economic Development and 
became the second dean of the 
school, a position he held from 
1975 to 1981.
Academically, he studied 
governmental institutions and 
was one of the first to 
develop an econometric study 
of governmental budgets.
He was also instrumental in 
developing scholarly societies, 
including the Association for 
Public Policy and Management 
and the Public Choice Society, 
and he served for a time as presi
dent ofeach.
He was interdisciplinary be
fore interdisciplinary was cool, 
said John Thomas, Davis friend
and former colleague.
Davis helped author Econometrica, an equation that at
tempted to solve how an elector
ate would vote, and developed 
the median voter idea with col
league Jim Barr.
But beyond his academic 
innovations, Davis is both fondly 
remembered and highly re
spected by those who knew him 
for his work in the humanitarian 
sector.
Davis served as chair of the 
Universitys Human Relations 
Commission, which deals with 
issues of gender and race, and he 
argued for benefits for same-sex 
partners of university employ
ees.
His office door was open to 
anybody with an idea, concern, 
or problem, and he was some
body whose confidence could be 
absolutely trusted, and who had 
an absolute optimism that prob
lems could be solved to mutual 
benefit, Strauss said.
Friends also said that 
Davis dedicated his time to 
bridging relationships between 
faculty and students, and he es
pecially worked to help acclimate 
foreign students to the Univer
sity.
Toby accepts his students as 
members of his extended fam
ily, states a memorial website for 
Davis. He helped many Chinese 
students better acclimate them
self to the American way of life. 
He always had students and'faculty who didnt have a place to go 
for the holidays come to his house 
for dinner and spend the holiday 
with his family. We, a group of 
Chinese students, kept in touch 
with Toby through the years even 
after graduation.
Thomas pointed out Davis im
pact on those he worked with.
This is a tough place. His role 
in the last 20 years was a guard
ian angel.
Davis died May 9 of liver fail
ure. He will be remembered in a 
memorial service this Saturday 
at 3:30 p.m. in the University 
Center, McConomy Auditorium. 
Numerous friends and colleagues

Donner, Morewood E Tower become hubs for extra students
For the first time, temporary housing packs overflow students into residence halls
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
Donner Hall, the linoleum and steel 
den of first-year housing, may seem a lit
tle crowded this semester. The lounges 
in Morewood E Tower may seem even 
more so. This is because students in tem
porary housing are no longer living off 
campus.
These students are a small, often 
overlooked demographic of Carnegie
Mellons first-year class. Their living 
arrangements are formally known as 
temporary housing, informally as temp 
house.
For the past three weeks, those in temp 
house have called increased-occupancy 
spaces in Donner Hall and Morewood E 
Tower lounges home. This is a change 
from previous years, in which temp 
house students lived in the Wyndham 
Garden Hotel until permanent on-campus spaces opened up. The Wyndham 
sits a mile down Forbes Avenue on the
far edge of the University of Pittsburghs 
(Pitts) campus.
The changes reflect Housing and Din
ings new policy for placing those few 
first-years dwelling at the bottom of the 
housing lottery.
We want to keep people on campus, 
said Wil Forrest, the associate director 
of Housing and Dining Services. And 
students have said, We would rather 
be on campus. Forrest referred to the 
choice between living on campus in an 
increased-occupancy space versus offcampus in a hotel.
This was a lot better than if I was in 
a hotel, said Matt Glantz, a first-year in 
the Tepper School of Business and temp 
house student. Glantz lived in a double 
that was converted to a triple in Donner.
I was really part of the hall. Ill come 
hang out here after I move out, he said.
Other temporary housing options 
included triples converted to quads in 
Donner and quints (five-person occu
pancy) set up in Morewood E Towers 
student lounges.
Donner has the largest doubles. It 
worked for the Tulane students for a 
whole semester, so why not three or four 
weeks? Forrest said.
Last year, about 25 students from Tu
lane University in New Orleans came to 
Carnegie Mellon for the fall semester 
in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. They 
were given similar increased-occupancy 
spaces in Donner.
Forest noted that 1430 first-years

University seeks $165 million in bonds from Allegheny County
by Patrick Pettibon
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon is trying hard 
to get around some serious ob
stacles in the way of something 
it might not even really need or 
want.
The University last week 
sought approval of a $165 million 
bond from the Allegheny County 
Higher Education Authority. The 
authority approved the bond is
sue last Tuesday.
The bond has two main pur
poses, Mark Kamlet, Carnegie 
Mellon provost, said. Mainly, the 
University needs the money to 
finance capital projects on cam
pus including $88 million for the 
construction of the Gates Center 
for Computer Science and $27 
million to renovate Doherty Hall. 
The University also hopes to up
date computer networks on cam
pus and has a $65 million option 
to refinance past loans.
The faculty let us know many 
years ago, if we wanted to keep a 
top-notch department, that these
[Doherty Hall] facilities that have 
not been renovated in 50 years be 
updated, Kamlet stated in an Au
gust 26 article in the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review. They reminded 
you of a 1940s chemistry lab.
But there are some problems 
to overcome before these renova
tions can begin.
Much has to happen before 
money changes hands, stated 
Robert Strauss, professor of eco
nomics and public policy at the 
H. John Heinz III School of Public 
Policy and Management. He ex
plained that the University must 
first obtain a clean audit opinion 
for the 2005-2006 financials, the 
report of which usually comes out 
around October 1.
Additionally, Strauss pointed 
out potential conflicts that may 
arise within the University. One 
issue, he noted, is that the en
tire University is being asked to 
support a project  the Gates 
Centerthat will only benefit the 
computer science department.
Presumably, notice will be 
taken of the fact that a $165 mil
lion bond issue is a very large
percentage increase in outstand
ing long-term indebtedness of the 
university, he stated.
Also, despite a $20 million gift 
from the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation, concern is growing 
over the Universitys need to bor
row to complete the project.
Usually when universities 
put up buildings, they wait until 
they have accumulated enough 
capital gifts so they dont have 
to borrow to put up a building, 
Strauss stated.
However, both Kamlet and 
Strauss have pointed out some po
tential benefits of implementing a 
bond from the county authority.
Created under state law, this 
authority issues tax-exempt 
bonds, explained the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review article.
Whenever universities build 
things, they issue bonds. The rea
son is for tax purposes, Kamlet 
said. We can issue bonds in taxexempt ways. We have a plan to 
finance the Gates building. Even 
though we have the money com
ing in, its beneficial to use the 
bond.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 11, 2006
On the fifth anniversary of 9/11, the University unites in remembrance
REMEMBRANCE, from A1
munity coming together in a way like never 
before, said then-Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy in the September 17 article.
In the days following, students painted the 
Fence with messages of hope and peace as 
they came together with candlelight to share 
their grief.
And now that hes on campus too, Nafday 
doesnt forget his first-hand account of that 
Tuesday. But while his receipt will always 
serve as a reminder of the pain he felt, he 
does not allow himself to think about the 
events unless hes provoked.
I have put it in my past, he said, but I still 
dont feel ready to watch all the movies that 
have been coming out about it.
Changes over the five years
Since 9/11, heightened security at air
ports has become a thing of life. But there 
are many programs, sprung as a result of the 
terrorist attacks, that many students are not 
aware of.
In a September 1 article published in USA 
Today, journalist Greg Toppo discusses a pro
gram called Project Strike Back, a project 
jointly headed by the Department of Educa
tion and the FBI. The program, created 10 
days after the terrorist attacks, examined the 
financial aid records of college students who 
were targeted by the FBI in terrorist investi
gations. Toppo wrote, Its unclear whether it
netted any terrorists, according to U.S. Edu
cation Department documents.
The program was created partly because 
Bush administration officials believed terror
ists were obtaining money through identity 
theft and fraud.
Although the program ended this June due 
to dwindling requests from the FBI and is just 
being made public to those in the higher edu
cation community.
There can and should be ways that we pro
tect security  obviously this government 
does that at the IRS, at the Social Security 
Administration and a lot of places, Secre
tary of Education Margaret Spellings stated 
in the USA Today article. And we work hard 
to do that.
Terry Hartle, senior vice-president of gov
ernment and public affairs for the American 
Council on Education, told Toppo the exis
tence of the program did not surprise her.
Its hard to be surprised when it has be
come obvious that the government is mining 
every database that they have, she stated. 
In the war on terror there are no safe har
bors where federal data is concerned.
Remembering 9/11 today
Just as the campus united five years 
ago, Carnegie Mellon is holding events 
throughout the week to honor those who 
were affected and to bring meaning to the 
day.
Today, there will be four moments of reflec
tion at th Fence. A single candle will be lit 
at 8:46 a.m., 9:02 a.m., 9:37 a.m., and 10:03 
a.m., representative of the significant events 
of 9/11. Also, Student Life will promote My 
Good Deed Drive, an initiative to have peo
ple mark September 11 by doing service or a 
random act of kindness.
I think its the sort of thing our students 
do well, said Renee Camerlengo, director 
of Student Life, who is also in charge of the 
weeks commemorative events.
Tomorrow, there will be an open forum 
titled How has your world view been shaped 
by the events since September 11, 2001? in 
McKenna-Peter Room at 7 p.m.
To end the week-long remembrance period, 
there will be a memorial service in Kresge 
Theater at 4:30 p.m. on Friday. The service 
will pay tribute to the lives of seven alumni 
lost on September 11 and commemorate the 
victims families.
At the service, an undergraduate student 
from Shanksville, Pa., will share the per
sonal perspective of living in the town now 
famous for the September 11 crash of United 
Airlines Flight 93. An open reading and re
flections at the 9/11 Memorial Tree near 
the tennis courts will follow the service at 
5:30 p.m.
Student Life encourages all community 
members to join and share their reflections.
Our current student culture will always 
have threads of 9/11 through it, Camerlengo 
said. Well never know how students will 
have been shaped by that day.

Student and faculty relief efforts continue one year after Hurricane Katrina
fundraiser.
Staff Council wasnt the only 
University organization to work 
with Tulane University. In the 
fall, 25 students from Tulane at
tended Carnegie Mellon as visit
ing students.
We started getting phone 
calls from Tulane and other insti
tutions from students who were 
finding that they were not going 
to be able to be in the school for 
the fall, and they were shopping 
for places that would take them, 
said Holly Hippensteel, coordi
nator for the Office of the Dean. 
Many were getting responses 
from institutions saying that 
they would like to help but didnt 
know how. So we quickly decided 
that we would try to host visiting 
students.
Unlike most other institutions, 
Carnegie Mellon worked with the 
displaced students to help them
the University. Students in apart
ments and campus housing were 
asked via e-mail to host Tulane 
students for a semester.
The response was enthusiastic 
enough that all of the displaced 
students were able to find and af
ford housing.
They were more than 
friendly, said Justin Feig, a ju
nior in mechanical engineering. 
They set me up with a dorm 
room, even though I didnt need 
one ... [and] a $50 meal plan 
to get started.... They were 
really friendly.
Feig, who also considered go
ing to the University of Miami 
in Florida, is one of a handful of 
former Tulane students that have 
decided to permanently transfer 
to Carnegie Mellon.
I called after the first day of 
school at Tulane to check on my 
application, and it had been dea holiday, Feig said. So I flew up 
that evening. I just threw every
thing that I had into a suitcase  
and I stayed here for the spring 
semester as well.
In addition to tabling and pro
viding housing for displaced stu
dents, Carnegie Mellon staff and 
students also worked together to 
arrange several trips to New Or
leans and the Gulf Coast to help 
with relief efforts.
Carnegie Mellons Habitat for 
Humanity International (HFHI) 
campus chapter worked with 
Student Development to send a 
group of students to Louisiana 
during their spring break to help 
construct houses for Katrina vic
tims. Yvonne Kiat, current presi
dent of Carnegie Mellons Habi
tat for Humanity chapter and a 
junior in business management, 
went to a separate HFHI event 
during the summer as part of a 
scholarship from General Mills.
Another organization that 
sent students to help in Katriaaffected areas was Alternative 
Break, a student-run organiza
tion that focuses on building 
relationships between small 
groups of Carnegie Mellon 
students and their hosts 
while assisting local organi
zations. The organizations 
first trip was to the Gulf Coast 
region near Bay St. Louis, Miss.
According to M. Shernell 
Smith, coordinator of Student 
Development, one of the ma
jor problems with organizing 
campus aid was staying focused 
on realistic goals and expecta
tions.
I think that at Carnegie Mel
lon we definitely have high ex
pectations for everything that we 
want to do, Smith said. I think 
that we want to do more, but you 
also have to be realistic, because 
it costs a lot.
One of the most unique fund
raising efforts was made en
tirely by a pair of Carnegie Mel
lon students. Steven Kaplan, a 
senior in information systems, 
and Keith Torluemke, a senior 
double major in information sys
tems and business administra
tion, worked together to create 
nickelsforkatrina.org, a website 
that sold blocks of pixels as ad
vertising space in return for do
nations.
It was a big fad around this 
time last year, Kaplan said. All 
these people were taking the 
money [from selling pixels] and 
putting into their pockets. We 
thought: What if we used the 
money for a donation?
The pair advertised their web
site through various blog sites 
and has raised $3000 so far, 
which will be donated to the Red 
Cross to help with Katrina aid ef
forts.
KATRINA, from Al
knew that the devastation was 
just so large that we had to make 
a decision on whom these gift 
cards would benefit, Droulia 
said. Ultimately, they partnered 
with Tulane - Universitys staff 
council to create an online ap
plication for Tulane staff and fac
ulty who needed aid.
There were over 500 applica
tions by the end of the first week 
last spring.
We knew we just could not 
meet that need, said Droulia. 
And thats why we revisited the 
fundraiser during the anniver
sary.
Staff Councils second fund
raiser, which ran from August 
29 to September 1, brought in 
roughly $1700  enough to buy 
gift cards for 60 to 70 people, in 
addition to the 80 applicants who

the official federal memorial to honor the 33rd President of the United States. In particular, 
the Truman Foundation extols President Trumans high regard for public service, his 
understanding of government, and his desire to enhance educational opportunities for 
all Americans.
In this spirit, the Truman Foundation (through the Truman Scholarship competition) 
seeks to encourage and support students (about 90 per year) who have outstanding 
potential for leadership in public service. Winners receive up to $30,000 for tuition, 
fees, books, and room/board ($3,000 for the senior year of undergraduate school, and 
up to $27,000 in graduate school [spread over two or three years of graduate study]).
Preliminary applications due: Friday. November 17. 2006. Up to 3-4 
students will be selected as University nominees and will then develop 
final applications for submission by late January 2007.
Additional information: Information and preliminary application materials are

A6 THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 11, 2006
Lawsuit 
claims 
gender bias
LAWSUIT, from Al
while excluding Paul.
Paul states that despite exclu
sion, she was able to obtain $3 
million in grants and to receive 
awards for her teaching.
The suit cites specific griev
ances against Paul by Khosla, 
and states that Khosla was 
known to harbor misogynous 
views and known to treat fe
male staff, all of U.S. origin, in 
a demeaning and dismissive 
fashion.
After Khosla had obtained a 
significant amount of money for 
the ECE departments Cylab 
activity, he directed grants to 
ECE research faculty members 
who were male or female (of 
foreign origin).
Pauls complaint also men
tions specific injustices by 
Bhagavatula.
In fall 2004, Paul sought pro
motion as an associate research 
professor. Her suit claims that 
during the application process, 
Bhagavatula withheld infor
mation regarding a late rec
ommendation letter written in 
Pauls favor and then urged her 
to withdraw her promotion ap
plication. The vote taken for the 
promotion resulted in an even 
split.
Paul claims Bhagavatula then 
discouraged her from seeking 
promotion again.
There was a fundamental 
disdain for women, and par
ticularly women of American 
descent, in the higher echelons 
of the ECE Department, the 
complaint states. Individuals 
of American origin were viewed 
as being products of an indiffer
ent or lax education system and 
are seen as being less produc
tive than students or potential 
faculty members of foreign 
origin.
According to Paul, during her 
time at Carnegie Mellon, she 
was the only United States-born 
female white faculty member in 
the department. She also claims 
that in 30 years, three white 
women have applied for similar 
promotions in the department, 
and all three were denied.
We deny these allegations, 
Bhagavatula stated in an e-mail 
message. He noted that because 
of the confidential nature of 
personnel matters involving 
faculty, he could not comment 
further.
Assistant vice-president for 
Media Relations Teresa Thomas 
issued a statement noting that, 
While the University regrets 
that Dr. Paul has chosen to file 
suit, the University is prepared 
to defend against the action and 
believes that it will ultimately 
prevail.
Khosla made a similar state
ment and would not comment 
further. Pileggi was unable to 
be reached for comment.
Paul, who stated she had 
no interest in presenting her 
claims through the media, has 
since left the University to take 
a position on the faculty at Vir
ginia Tech.

dent Dormitory Councils role in 
making the decision. We talked 
with them about it in the spring. 
We told them we wanted to try it. 
They were generally positive.
Jeremy Neuberg, a sophomore 
in public policy and manage
ment, lived in the Wyndham last 
year for several weeks, waiting 
for a spot in campus housing 
to open. He explained that the 
shuttle for commuting to campus 
was unreliable. Maid service, he 
said, was also scaled back from 
the typical hotel service.
I was barely involved in Ori
entation at all, Neuberg said. 
Air-conditioning in his room, he 
said, was the highlight of his ex
perience.
I felt very detached from 
Carnegie Mellon  more like a 
Pitt student, Neuberg said. Stu
dents in the Wyndham traveled 
through the heart of Pitts cam
pus to get to classes everyday via 
a shuttle departing every halfhour. i
Folks love to have maid ser
vice, but they felt mixed into a 
business, Forrest said of stu
dents at the Wyndham.
So what was one of the draw
backs to being on campus? Glantz 
noted that in the future, Hous
ing and Dining- could improve 
the situation for on-campus tem
porary housing students further 
by providing air-conditioned 
rooms for increased occupancy 
rooms.
Orientation week was un
bearable with all the extra bod
ies, furniture, and stuff in the 
small space.
HOUSING, from A3
arrived on move-in day, even 
though admisions predicted 
fewer.
We need to fill all our spaces, 
he said. It is a function of the art 
and science of admissions and 
housing.
In recent years, there have 
been 30 to 50 temporary housing 
students. In some years, there 
have been as many as 90. The 
number of spaces opening up 
each fall fluctuates depending on 
how many students drop out dur
ing the semester, fail to show up 
on the first day, or transfer lastminute. As time goes on, Greek 
housing and dropouts allow for 
more spaces.
Frat rush traditionally solves 
a lot of the housing problems, 
said Tim Michael, the director 
of Housing and Dining Services. 
We allow all upperclassmen 
to retain their spaces, and more 
did that than expected this 
year.
This year, temporary housing 
started with 49 students without 
a place to live. Four More wood 
lounges held five students each. 
Housing placed locks on the 
doors and replaced the couches 
and tables with wardrobes, beds, 
and desks.
Overall, 29 students were 
placed throughout Donner, 
mostly in converted doubles, and 
two in converted triples.
The Donner [rooms] are pretty 
big, Glantz said. There isnt a 
lot of space for personal belong
ings, but they provided storage
space. That definitely helped.
Glantz moved into Scobell on 
Saturday. He said things worked 
out well with his two Donner 
roommates, called hosts by 
Housing and Dining.
Michael explained that Hous
ing met with students designated 
as hosts and discussed their responsibilities; Housing selected 
hosts from students permanently 
placed in Donner and asked them 
to take in an extra student until 
space opened up.
Morewood needs its lounges 
back, Michael said.
David Drochner, a first-year in 
CIT, was one of the temp house 
students in Morewood forced 
to move out last weekend. He 
is moving into Cathedral Man
sions, the off-campus Oakland 
apartment building where Hous
ing and Dining leases some 
apartments, typically for upper
classmen.
Its going to be hard going offcampus after living on. I tried to
it does work out.
Sreekanti is still living in a tri
ple converted to a quad in Don
ner. He was displeased with how 
well Housing and Dining kept 
him informed of the situation.
I wish they gave me more of a 
heads-up. The initial e-mail after 
they said I had been placed on a 
wait list did not mention that I 
was living in a triple.
According to Sreekanti, the 
e-mail he received over the 
summer regarding his fall housCollege is about meeting people. As a freshman I want to be 
on campus. So in a way it does work out.
 Vibhav Sreekanti
We put $10 on their PlaidCa$h 
accounts, encouraging them to 
get a meal together, Michael 
said. Hopefully they spent it 
well.
Michael noted that in some 
cases, students decided they 
wanted to stay in their current 
arrangements for the rest of the 
year. In these cases, Housing 
provided a reduced rate on the 
room.
While less than five temp house 
students remain in Donner, with 
one opting to stay for the se
mester, the Morewood E Tower 
lounge residents were forced to 
move out by last Saturday.
hold out for on-campus but they 
said I had to be out Saturday, 
Drochner said. I definitely would 
have preferred the lounge.
Drochner had positive feed
back for Housing and Dining.
I like that they were pretty 
worried about us. They are going 
to send people to help me move, 
he said.
Vibhav Sreekanti, a first-year 
in the School of Computer Sci
ence, described his experience 
as temporary housing student in 
a mostly positive light.
College is about meeting peo
ple. As a freshman I want to be 
on campus, he said. So in a way
ing assignment only said that he 
had been removed from the wait 
list. It did not mention that he 
was still technically a temp house 
student living in a temporarily 
increased occupancy space.
In the years in which tem
porary housing students were 
placed in the Wyndham Garden 
Hotel, Michael found that they 
seemed to participate in cam
pus organizations and activities 
as much the rest of the student 
body.
The idea of taking longer to 
connect during Orientation reso
nated, though, he said.
The director described the StuGender gap closes nationally, stays stagnant at Carnegie Mellon
GENDER, from Al
Higher Education. Fisher re
ferred. to the application process 
in which prospective students 
must apply to one of the special
ized colleges within the Univer
sity.
That might be linked to the 
fact that, on average, women 
tend to change majors slightly 
more than men, Fisher said.
Indira Nair, vice-provost for 
education, speculated that the 
reason might be socioeconomic. 
She explained that, the higher a 
students socioeconomic status, 
the more she strives for a big 
name school.
Women who are let in here 
are already outstanding in per
formance, she said. Such stu
dents, she said, will be accepted 
to almost any school to which 
they apply, and will attend the 
one they think has the most im
pressive reputation  which is 
not always, she believes, Carn
egie Mellon.
The presence of female faculty 
on campus may be a third rea
son. As of last fall, the propor
tion of female faculty on campus 
was just 29.2 percent, according 
i
to the Carnegie Mellon Factbook 
2005-2006 prepared by Institu
tional Research and Analysis.
However, this statistic seems 
to be in line with the national 
trend. According to the 2004 
special report by The Chronicle, 
in 2001-2002, more than 70 per
cent of professors teaching at top 
research universities like Carn
egie Mellon were male.
The Chronicle faulted research 
universities in particular for 
hindering women faculty. The 
higher up on the academic pres
tige ladder a university is, the 
fewer women it usually has in 
tenured faculty positions, the 
report stated. While the nation 
is doing a good job of turning out 
women with research doctor
ates, the top 50 institutions in 
research spending are not doing 
such a good job of hiring them.
Carnegie Mellons data sup
ports this claim. In 2005, women 
made up only 22.4 percent of the 
universitys tenure stream fac
ulty.
Without a strong network of 
female faculty with whom fe
male students can identify, the 
number of female students may 
continue to stagnate.
i
However, Fisher has seen this 
scenario occur in reverse. Fifteen 
years ago, he said, there was one 
female student in computer sci
ence for every two or three men. 
Currently, the ratio is closer to 
one to one. Meanwhile, he ad
mits that the change among fac
ulty has been slower.
Nair remains positive, citing 
the increasing numbers of women 
faculty across all departments as 
one area in which the university 
has made significant progress.
She also speculates that, for 
male faculty members, having 
teenage daughters contributes 
to a greater understanding about 
how to treat women in the uni
versitys male-dominated fields.
Part of the difficulty in recruit
ing female students in science 
and engineering, for all universi
ties, she said, is that there are just 
so few interested to begin with.
There is self-selection. This 
is a very narrow group, Nair 
said. Its not about competence 
or ability  it is about what you 
care about.
Having received a doctorate in 
physics herself, Nair understands 
what women are looking for in a 
science department.V
Women look for connection
 understanding the work in 
a social context and connect
ing to the social good, she said. 
Women bring to [science and 
engineering] a different ethos.
This theory has trickled down 
to some Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members. Candice Gesecki, a ju
nior in chemical and biomedical 
engineering, wrote in an e-mail 
that one of her female professors 
explained why girls pick some 
engineering fields over others. 
Her professor told her females 
are more attracted to chemical or 
biomedical engineering because 
these fields have more global 
connections and more humani
tarian opportunities.
Fisher sees the situation in his 
line of work slightly differently. 
Its about creating an environ
ment for women to be computer 
scientists, he said. It boils down 
to making a broader picture than 
the traditional hacker stereo
type.
Both Nair and Fisher point to a 
variety of recent actions the uni
versity has undertaken to make 
the sciences more accessible to 
women. Fisher said the Office of 
Admission rebalanced its admis
sions criteria to weigh applicants 
leadership abilities and other 
personality factors more heavily, 
areas in which women are gener
ally more skilled.
As far as work ethic goes, the 
majority of my peers are incred
ibly hard-working, regardless of 
their gender, stated Anne Steinhardt, a senior engineering and 
public policy major and presi
dent of the Society of Women 
Engineers, in an e-mail message. 
[But] I do feel that all the women 
in my major are more social and 
outgoing than the men.
Fisher added that the engi
neering school changed its cur
riculum to allow students to 
mix required courses with those 
focusing on applying and experi
menting engineering principles, 
giving women the practical con
nections they seek.
Nair explained that the 
computer science department 
changed its admission require
ments to no longer require prior 
programming experience. The 
year after the change was made, 
Nair said, applications increased 
38 percent.
The efforts seem to have 
worked. People always talk
about how women will have to 
be harder workers to get equal 
treatment, but I havent noticed 
that at all, Steinhardt stated. 
Professors just seem to learn my 
name first because Im one of the 
only women.
Gesecki believes there is still 
room for improvement.
I think Carnegie Mellon 
could do a better job of putting 
a female face on some of the ma
jors. I know that if I was a fresh
man, and I was about to talk to 
a female electrical engineer and 
see that its not just an all-male 
department, maybe that would 
have spurred me to check out 
some ECE classes or learn more, 
she stated.
Both Fisher and Nair also 
credit cultural changes over time 
with making it easier for women 
to excel.
Its a combination of whats 
been going on in society at large 
and intentional efforts by the 
university, Fisher said.
Nair agreed. Women feel 
more included, feel that their 
voices are being heard, she 
said. Women here are doing ex
tremely well.

Fly genes show sign 
of global warming
A recent sampling of fruit fly 
genes by a group of scientists 
revealed a startling verification 
of the global warming theory. 
The recent study found a higher 
instance of genetic code flips, 
called inversions. Inversions 
in fruit fly genetics have been 
historically linked to warmer 
temperature trends. The recent 
genetic sample led the scientists 
to report that climate warming 
will significantly impact the 
future ecological and environ
mental states.

British researchers 
speed up finger
print ID
A team at the University of 
Sheffield in England has devel
oped a new data compression 
technique to speed up finger
print transmissions. Typically, 
a fingerprint takes anywhere 
from four to 20 minutes to 
transfer from the crime scene to 
the lab. Using the new compres
sion system, transmission takes 
only 30 to 60 seconds. The sys
tem also cuts identification lead 
time from an average of four 
days to less than two hours.

Carnegie Mellon team to build autonomous vehicle to tackle city landscapes
by Shawn Wertz
Science & Technology Editor
Navigating the urban jungle just got 
a whole new meaning for one Carnegie 
Mellon team. The University recently an
nounced its upcoming participation in 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) Urban Challenge, to be 
held in November 2007.
Past DARPA challenges required com
petitors to create an autonomous vehicle 
that could race across the desert with 
other teams vehicles.
Research professor William Red 
Whittaker heads Tartan Racing, the team 
of Carnegie Mellon researchers who will 
participate in the competition.
Whittaker is a member of the Robotics 
Institute and no stranger to DARPA com
petitions. In fact, Carnegie Mellon com
peted in two of DARPAs previous chal
lenges under Whittakers leadership.
But the 2007 Grand Challenge will 
provide its challengers with a brand new 
experience. Instead of being held in the
desert, as it was in the past, competitors 
in 2007 will race their vehicles within a 
city.
The urban challenge is a very bold 
challenge. It might defy victory in the 
first or second competition, said Whit
taker. But the only way to know that is 
to pursue it.
To increase its chances of winning, the 
team has gathered some of the leading 
researchers and sponsors in the auto
motive industry. Were running with a 
great front line of sponsors. They have a 
huge stake in this, Whittaker said.
Chris Urmson is Tartan Racings tech
nology leader. As technology leader, it is 
Urmsons primary task to guide Tartan 
Racings team of researchers while pre
paring for the challenge.
The biggest thing involved is just un
derstanding the technology were trying 
to use, Urmson said. The task is daunt
ing, but its very exciting.
Tartan Racings first large sponsor was 
automotive giant General Motors Corp., 
which had planned on joining with Carn
egie Mellon for months.
Whittaker expressed excitement about 
the automotive sponsor, saying, Theyre 
as big as it gets, and theyre keen to win 
this. Theyre just phenomenal partners.
GM provided Tartan Racing with two 
Chevy Tahoes. Chevy, advertised as be
ing like a rock, will get to prove its 
claim as it maneuvers the city streets 
without a human driver.
Whittaker said that none of the com
petitors are really certain about what 
type of car, and particularly what size of 
car, would fare the best in the challenge.
The team decided that a larger car 
with a strong body frame would be able 
to withstand less-than-perfect road con
ditions.
The team plans to outfit the automo
biles with cameras, sensors, and auto
mated steering and braking capabilities, 
which the team acknowledged is a diffi
cult task.
CMU does a lot of things really well, 
but you wouldnt think of us as a main
stream automotive technology school, 
Whittaker said.
The race to the race can be more chal
lenging than the race itself. No matter 
how hard you work, you cant do it just on 
air. It takes money, and it takes tremen
dous commitment.
To help the team with financing the 
challenge, several other sponsors have 
joined Tartan Racing, including Cater
pillar, Google, and Intel. Speed costs 
money, and the only question is: How 
fast do you want to go?, Whittaker said.
Mobileye will be assisting the team 
with the cameras they intend to use on 
the vehicles. They do a great job in cam
era vision to read the road, said Whit
taker.
And its that task that makes the 2007 
Urban Challenge different from DARPAs 
previous ones. During the course, Tartan 
Racings vehicle will have to stay within 
traffic lanes, obey traffic signals, and ne
gotiate intersections autonomously.
I think it has tremendous implica
tions, said Urmson. If we are able to de
velop autonomous cars, we can give free
dom to people who are at a disadvantage

Upcoming minority science 
graduates across the country 
may now have even more op
portunities to study at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Recently, Carnegie Mellon and 
Microsoft Corporation joined 
forces to establish a new scholar
ship for college graduates plan
ning on studying entertainment 
technology.
The entertainment and devices 
division at Microsoft established 
the Microsoft Entertainment and 
Technology Diversity Scholar
ship on August 16.
The scholarship targets La
tinos, African-Americans, and
women in the information tech
nology field who are pursuing 
a masters in entertainment 
technology (MET) from the En
tertainment Technology Center 
(ETC).
Microsoft and Carnegie Mel
lon hope the scholarship will pro
mote an increase in the number 
of minority students seeking an 
MET.
To do so, the scholarship pro
vides the student with $10,000 
for tuition, as well as eligibility 
for internships at Microsoft.
We are delighted and proud 
to provide talented women and 
minority students with this ex
citing opportunity to learn about 
digital entertainment at a worldclass institution, stated Robbie 
Bach in Microsofts press release.
Bach is the president of Micro
softs entertainment and devices 
division.
Microsoft and Carnegie Mel
lon hope to reflect the diversity of 
the global population of innova
tors and leaders who will impact 
the future of technology indus
tries and universities.
The MET program takes two 
years to complete. Carnegie Mel
lon is the only institution to offer 
graduate students a chance to get 
their degrees in entertainment 
technology.
Many MET graduates pursue 
careers in graphic art, game de
sign, and computer program
ming. Over the past six years, 
160 students have graduated 
with an MET.
We create a shared culture
that transcends geographic, 
cultural, and even intellectual 
boundaries, said Don Marinelli, 
the ETCs global executive pro
ducer. We bring technologists 
and artists together to learn, 
explore, and create, Marinelli 
said.
In addition to the diversity 
scholarship, Microsoft granted 
the University $795,000 in phil
anthropic support.
Carnegie Mellon used the grant 
for funding faculty and student 
programs in areas ranging from 
robotics and computer science to 
design and engineering.
Microsofts ties with Carnegie 
Mellon are not solely financial, 
however.
Microsoft employs more than 
220 Carnegie Mellon alumni and
participates in the Technical Op
portunities Conference (TOC) 
each year.
Projects at the ETC integrate 
the artistic and technical back
grounds of students. The ETC is 
currently working on many inno
vative, dynamic projects.
In collaboration with the New 
York Fire Department, the ETC 
is currently working on Hazmat 
Hotzone, an interactive training 
program that trains emergency 
workers how to respond to haz
ardous materials emergencies.
Animatronics is another large 
program at the ETC, and is re
sponsible for animated robots. 
In fact, the center has its own, 
called Horatio Doc Beardsley.

are a breeding ground far think
ers and innovators with access to 
new and relevant technologies. It 
is typical that start-ups use many 
college campuses across the 
world as springboards into their 
relevant industries.
The research at Carnegie Mel
lon is so prolific that an enter
prise has emerged solely to fund, 
market, and protect university 
technologies.
The Carnegie Mellon Center 
for Technology Transfer and En
terprise Creation (CTTEC) works 
with companies and start-up 
firms interested in licensing in

which provides additional re
sources and aid for start-up uni

up images of ticker tape, office

gross domestic product of Spain.
But aside from being the eco
nomic and technological power
houses that they are today, these 
companies share one distinct and 
fundamental trait: They both be
gan as start-ups.
In the 2006 fiscal year alone, 
Carnegie Mellon University gave 
rise to no less than 14 start-up 
companies born from university 
technology, according to an Au
gust 21 press release.
The focus of these companies 
runs the gamut from hard sci
ences to entertainment technol
ogy and highlights the research 
taking place right under the nose 
of Carnegie Mellons campus.
Current start-ups
GreenOx is one Carnegie Mel
lon start-up company, a green 
chemistry company that is de
veloping a market for a group of 
oxidation catalysts called TAML 
catalysts.
The catalysts perform a host of 
oxidation reactions. These reac
tions are responsible for destroy
ing a lot of big pollutants. Some 
of the other start-up companies 
originally started on CMU prop
erty.
Situated alongside the Monongahela River lies Carnegie Mel
lons Entertainment Technology 
Center (ETC). Developers at the 
ETC have long since ditched their 
lab coats and pipettes for animatronics and joysticks. As a result, 
the ETC was the point of cre
ation for many entertainmenttechnology-based start-ups.
The ETC has been hailed as an 
innovations giant in its own right, 
creating lifelike video games that 
tackle national and international 
problems. The center has already 
given rise to six start-up compa
nies, the latest being Sim Ops, a 
company specializing in training-simulation games.
Sim Ops is involved in the de
velopment of HazMat Hot Zone, 
a training simulator for firefight
ers that has been incorporated 
into the New York City Fire De
partments training program.
One such company, Bossa Nova

Black boxes
Saravana Sivasankaran
Once in a while we hear news 
about an air crash that killed 
many people. As news spreads 
about this catastrophic event 
and fingers start to point at the 
people responsible, safety in
vestigators point toward a dif
ferent source: the well-known 
black box in the plane.
In reality, black boxes arent 
really black: Most are bright 
orange in color to aid investiga
tors in their recovery. The term 
is used by physicists to refer to 
a device whose internal work
ings are deliberately hidden or 
ignored while the input and 
output are well understood.
The technology behind black 
boxes is in a state of transition. 
Black boxes are moving from 
the traditional use of magnetic 
tapes to the use of solid state 
technology boards.
The solid state technology 
boards are the result of sig
nificant advances in black box 
technology in planes, and offer 
increased durability, robustness 
and memory capacity among 
other things.
Solid state uses stacked ar
rays of memory chips, so un
like magnetic tapes, there are 
no moving parts and therefore 
fewer maintenance issues and a 
decreased chance of something 
breaking during a crash.
Another advantage is that 
magnetic-tape recorders can 
track about 100 parameters, 
while solid-state recorders 
can track more than 700 in 
larger aircrafts, according to 
HowStuf{Works, com.
For instance, the Solid State 
Flight Data Recorder (SSFDR) 
developed by Honeywell, a 
leader in black box technology
and manufacturing, retains the 
most recent 25 hours of digital 
flight data and timing informa
tion.
Similarly, according to 
Honeywells website, the Solid 
State Cockpit Voice Recorder 
retains the most recent 30 min
utes or two hours of audio, digi
tal, and timing information.
Both these devices use a mod
ular crash survivable memory 
unit {CSMU) for protection of 
the memory board.
The use of black boxes has 
found its way into other indus
tries, too. Black boxes have been 
used in automobiles for a long 
time  GM has been installing 
black box technology in its cars 
for more than a decade. These 
have helped police gather infor
mation about traffic accidents.
So whats next for black 
boxes? We could soon expect 
to see cockpit video recorders, 
which will provide a more de
tailed peek at the events before 
a crash.
Also, small heat-resistant 
black boxes for space probes are 
being developed. NASA recently 
signed a deal with the Aerospace 
Corporation to develop black 
boxes called Reentry Breakup 
Recorders (REBRs).
Black boxes are not usually 
used on spacecraft such as the 
shuttle, which experiences ex
treme heating when roaring 
back into Earths atmosphere.
The planned REBRs would 
quietly take data during the 
flight, but would only activate 
in the event of a major disaster. 
The heat from the crafts ex
plosion would trigger the boxes 
to detach, and, as they fall to 
Earth, the boxes would transmit 
their data, eliminating the need 
to retrieve the recorder later.

because of disability or age. 
Whittaker also talked about 
the importance of the challenge. 
Winning the challenge is not 
the ultimate goal. Its just a start 
to creating good research oh 
automating a multitude of ma
chines, he said.
If you think about it world
wide, if you go to Japan or South 
America, and how big a deal are 
coal-mining robots.
Whittaker and Urmson both 
said that they were excited to 
participate in the upcoming 
challenge because of their team.
Some team members are very 
dear friends, because we started 
together and weve stayed to
gether, Whittaker said. And 
there are tremendous rookies
that are fresh blood that bring 
the vitality and creativity of new 
ideas, as well as a lot of serious 
work to the game.
I think its great were doing 
it, Urmson said.
But the team still has a large 
amount of work to do in order 
to be ready on race day. For this 
team, time is what matters. The 
clock is ticking, Whittaker said.
As for the location of the race, 
all that any of the teams know is 
that it will be held in a city on the 
West Coast. DARPA traditionally 
doesnt let the teams know of the 
location until two days prior to 
the race.
Tartan Racing still remains 
confident. Were a force to be 
reckoned with, said Whittaker, 
and were going to be there on 
race day.

How Things Work: 
Walk-through metal detectors
Michael M. Whiston
MET scholarship promotes minority students
Walking through an airport metal detec
tor 10 years from now will be a different 
experience than it is today.
Most walk-through metal detectors today 
use pulse induction to pick up on metal 
objects located on or hidden underneath 
clothing.
Pulse induction is the process of send
ing out an electrical impulse in a wire coil. 
This electrical impulse creates a magnetic 
field, which disappears once the pulse ends. 
Another electric pulse (called the reflected 
pulse) is then sent through the wire.
This process is repeated hundreds of times 
per second.
In the presence of metal objects, the first 
electrical impulse creates a magnetic field 
around the object. Once the initial impulse 
disappears, however, the objects magnetic 
field causes the reflected impulse to last 
longer than normal.
Measurements of the reflected signal are 
sent to an integrator, which is a mechanism 
that transforms signals into direct current. 
Direct current joins an audio circuit, and an 
alarm sounds if metal is present.
Though current airport metal detectors 
are an accurate way to determine the pres
ence of metallic objects, they do not provide 
details for airport security guards to know 
what type of metallic object a person has 
with him or her. Aviation security compa
nies are trying to address this problem.
Researchers for security device manufac
turers are creating metal detectors that can 
separate the body into separate zones and 
see through clothing.
Unlike many older scanners, the most re
cently produced scanners can focus on each 
individual zone and detect the presence of 
metal.
One such detector is the InteUiscan, man
ufactured by OkRanger. This detector scans 
a persons body in 18 zones. Six horizontal 
divisions cover a persons head, shoulders, 
chest, waist, knees, and feet, and three verti
cal divisions cover the left, center, and right 
portions of the body.
InteUiscan detects the presence of mul

tiple weapons and locates them in one of 
the 18 zones.
Multi-zone detectors may cut back on the 
number of false alarms caused by coins and 
belt buckles. A multiple-zone detector has a 
threshold for each zone, and these thresh
olds can be set so that the alarm is less likely 
to sound because of harmless metal objects.
In addition to detecting the location of 
weapons, the next step in security scanner 
technology involves the ability to detect 
plastics, drugs, and explosives.
X-ray technology, for instance, allows bag
gage screeners to see into luggage, detect
ing everything from handheld weapons to 
plastic toys. Researchers would similarly like 
to see into human clothes.
But theres one problem: Radiation of 
this kind can harm peoples skin. But re
searchers are proposing a possible solution 
to the radiation problem: millimeter-wave 
technology.
Millimeter waves are a form of radiation 
with a frequency ranging from 20 to 100 
gigahertz. Such radiation poses no health 
risk to humans, and it can detect all objects
 cjrugs, explosives, and metals  hidden 
underneath clothing.
Millimeter-wave technology produces im
ages based on differing levels of radiation 
given off by objects.
European research establishment Farran 
Technology is working on the Tadar 
Millimeter-Wave People Screening Camera.
This camera detects objects using millimeter-wave technology, making clothes 
transparent but other objects visible. The 
radiation emitted from guns and explosives, 
for instance, contrasts with the radiation 
emitted from ones skin, leading to clear 
pictures of hidden objects.
If millimeter-wave scanners become pres
ent in airports all across the globe, passen
gers would no longer be asked to walk (and 
re-walk) through archway metal detectors.
Instead, they would stand in a tempera
ture-controlled environment and receive 
whole-body scans before boarding their 
planes.
Presumably, such a procedure would 
eliminate the need for body searches. It 
could also make security lines shorter.
With fewer false alarms and more com
plete pictures of concealed objects, airport 
security is becoming not only safer but eas
ier as well.
graphic design, robotics, human-computer interaction, psy
chology, and theater.
The robot is known for its 
unique personality and its natu

Quasi is only one aspect of the 
technology coming out of the 
ETC. CMU and Microsoft hope 
that the new scholarship will 
bring more students to the ETC, 
and increase the possibility of 
developing new technology.

Theres more to higher education than just test scores and prestige
Since 1983, colleges and universities 
across the country have fought tooth and 
nail for the highest rankings in U.S. News
& World Report. The U.S. News rankings, 
which grade how much collegiate bang 
you get for your buck, have turned a 
little predictable lately. Harvard, Yale, 
and Princeton always lounge at the top 
while the new Ivies  Carnegie Mellon 
included  annually struggle to climb 
up a rung or two. (We came in at number 
21 in the 2007 rankings, up one from last 
year.)
But the U.S. News ranking method
ology is conspicuously lacking in one 
aspect  it doesnt consider what each 
college or university gives back to the 
country. Carnegie Mellon might give you 
a solid curriculum vitae, but does it en
courage community service and civic 
duty? Does it go out of its way to offer 
opportunities to those who cant afford 
the cost of attendance? And how many of 
its esteemed alumni are working to help 
stop global warming or end poverty?
Enter the editors of Washington 
Monthly Magazine. Their goal is to find 
out which schools are the best based on 
how well they utilize your tax dollars.
How are todays universities faring?
The answer might surprise you. 
Washington Monthly used three stan
dards to rank schools: how much a school 
got involved in national and community 
service, how it used its research dollars 
(quantified in Ph.D.s), and how much it 
encouraged social mobility (quantified 
in how many Pell Grants they gave out to 
lower-income students, and how many 
of those students successfully gradu
ated) . Based on their methodology, state 
schools and other public institutions 
climbed to the top, while the so-called 
top schools dropped in stature consid
erably. Carnegie Mellon tumbled over 
30 spots to number 54. Furthermore, 
the majority of Carnegie Mellons peer 
schools were ranked higher, with MIT 
at number one and Stanford University 
at number seven.
Washington Monthly does not offer 
explicit reasons for each schools rank
ing, but we can take an educated, if not 
downright obvious, guess as to our fall 
from grace. Were weak when it comes 
to community engagement and were 
not accessible to low-income students. 
Dont look so shocked. In 2004, Carnegie
Mellon distributed $1,844,000 in Pell 
Grants to low-income students. Compare 
that to Stanford University, a school of 
comparable size and population that 
gave out $2,490,258 in Pell Grants to its 
class of 2009. As for promoting service 
through national programs, Stanford 
sent 36 graduates into the Peace Corps 
in 2004, while Carnegie Mellon sent only 
eight through the Heinz School.
If youre looking for more local service 
initiatives, you might be disappointed: 
For the 2006-2007 school year, the Joint 
Funding Committee allocated less than
2 percent of its million-dollar budget to 
groups dedicated to community service.
In short, Carnegie Mellon may be get
ting the best and the brightest, but it 
might not be putting them to the best 
use. Richard Hofstadter wrote, The task 
of a university is the creation of the fu
ture, so far as rational thought and civi
lized modes of appreciation can affect 
the issue. Imagine what we could do 
if students, faculty, and administration 
extended themselves in terms of ser
vice and outreach  not just to impress 
Washington Monthly, but to better the 
future for our country and community.

as Americans think, feel, and do. It has 
not, however, made us all alike. The 
phrase united we stand has become 
pass. The old worldwide sentiment 
We are all Americans is scoff-worthy. 
Nevertheless, looking back after five 
years, we wish there could be one 
consensus: a respectful, a worthy com
memoration of the victims.
First, there are the movies. Wed like 
to believe that these films were created 
out of respect and the spirit of remem
brance, but cynicism leads us to believe 
that someone decided enough time had 
passed, and it was time to make a buck.
Flight 93 did not raise too many eye
brows, with its small cast and relatively 
focused approach. But World Trade 
Center, directed by the controversial 
Oliver Stone, has caused a stir. We dont 
need special effects to authentically 
recreate images which no American can 
erase from his or her memory, and which 
at the time of their actual unfolding 
didnt even seem truly real. We dont 
need to see a scripted reenactment of 
that fearful day in front of the television. The breathtaking uncertainty is 
still fresh.
There is so little that these films can 
illuminate so soon, but so much at stake. 
We have to wonder whether these por
trayals will negatively affect how the 
events settle into written history and, 
more importantly, popular memory.
In this weeks Time magazine, Nancy 
Gibbs called September 11 the loss with 
no grave, not because squabbling ham
pers the construction of its memorial, 
not because of the monstrously conten
tious wars it spawned, not because of 
the evaporation of global goodwill or 
the erosion of American civil liberties or 
even the re-stoked inferno of religious 
rivalry. The loss has no grave because it 
was an act of aggression that, completely 
unlike its historical predecessors, could 
never be avenged by a single act of de
cisive heroism, no presidential pushing 
of the Big Red Button. That day revealed 
to us not a political enemy but many 
ideological ones. While political enemies 
can be fought on ballots and battlefields, 
ideological foes inhabit a disturbingly 
amorphous front line.
Too often September 11 has been ex
ploited as a trigger for Americans emo
tions. It has become a stone to throw in
political discourse, a rhetorical trump 
card. After all, this is a war of ideol
ogy, and often ideologies  at least 
the ones the war on terror is concerned 
with arent couched in reason; they 
are carved into a culture. When certain 
members of or society seek to hardwire 
the American brain, to induce acquies
cence at the mention of past pain, they 
commit an act of ideological violence. 
They fight terrorism on terrors terms.
There is only one way we can achieve 
a righteous victory on all fronts. We 
must become better. We can defeat our 
enemies, preserve our proud liberties, 
and regain international esteem, but we 
will never do it by succumbing to the 
fervor of ideology or by lobbing missiles 
first and verifying intelligence later. We 
will do it by becoming a nation of bet
ter individuals, a nation of citizens who 
dont sit on the sidelines, who learn, who 
think, who shelve partisanship and have 
a deep, frank conversation about our 
nations values.
People say we lost our innocence 
on that day. Let future generations 
also see the death of our navet, our 
complacency, and our ignorance. That 
is the grave September 11, 2001, truly 
deserves.
How do we really rank?
Words of wisdom from the 
late, esteemed Otto Davis
_______________Benjamin Hackett
Ask Ralph Waldo Emerson and he 
will tell you, To believe your own 
thought, to believe that what is true 
for you in your private heart is true for 
all men  that is genius. The thought 
here is an understanding of the exis
tence of a potential good which ema
nates from every man. It is within each 
and every person to strive, achieve, 
and pursue micro- and macro-based 
improvement. Thus, the universality 
of a common effort towards develop
ment and betterment is born.
It is within thpse constructs that 
one can see the motivation toward 
progressing and upgrading ones sur
roundings. This improvement can 
hark upon ones words and often 
harks upon those words alone. To be 
based on speech alone is all too com
mon. That is why, when a talent comes 
along that brings such thoughts into 
fruition, it leaves its mark securely 
upon the world in which it existed. 
Otto Toby Davis was one such man I 
have encountered in my life.
Otto Davis died on May 9; he was 72 
years old. Davis had taught at Carn
egie Mellon since, the 1960s, bringing 
with him a sense of interdisciplinary 
cooperation and expansive thought. 
Among his considerable legacies were 
his roles as a founder and later as the 
second dean of the School of Urban 
and Public Affairs. Those of you read
ing might be more familiar with this 
institutions contemporary name, the 
Heinz School. But the legacy alone 
does not characterize Davis properly.
He was a can-do man in the spirit 
of this great can-do nation. It was an 
honor to meet Dvis during my first 
two years here at Carnegie Mellon. 
He was my advisor for the policy and 
management major in the social and 
decision sciences department. Always 
with a sharp wit and a clever story to 
tell, he delivered sage advice and an 
understanding of that which is impor
tant, and that which is just process.
The genius lies in Davis understand
ing that one man moving steadfastly 
against a tide of apathy can still make 
a difference. This was how he pursued 
his goals, even in light of the apathy, 
and often negative energy, that sur
rounded him. This was especially the 
case as he went about pursuing pub
lic policy changes hre in Pittsburgh 
throughout the 1960s and 1970s.
I remember seeking his advice con
cerning my major requirements one 
placid afternoon in his office. Instead 
of dealing with any of those issues, 
we ended up in a multi-hour discus
sion concerning the severity of the 
mill closings on Pittsburgh and its 
subsequent lack of development. This 
contemporary parable sticks with me 
to this day as a real-life example of
progress through devotion.
During our conversation, Davis took 
only one quick aside to acknowledge 
his deteriorating condition, in which he 
explained to me his need to seek health 
asylum in order to continue pursuing his 
work. Having moved past that prereq
uisite acknowledgement, he launched 
straight into one of the classic examples 
concerning the importance of effecting 
change, even when it seems impossible.
Davis told me about a period of Pitts
burgh history when, as the mills closed, 
the city floundered. He told me of a la
bor policy that said if a mans age plus 
his number of years on a job reached a 
certain threshold, the man was eligible 
for a full pension for the rest of his life 
(which I believe at the time was 80 per
cent pay). Even in the midst of the des
peration occurring citywide, when raw 
materials proved too costly to bring into 
Pittsburgh, Davis saw an opportunity to 
improve the city from the raw resources 
within.
The resources he saw were the peo
ple of Pittsburgh. With the help of an 
acquaintance he launched a start-up 
company designed to aid burgeoning 
entrepreneurs. The theory was that men 
already backed up with unconditional 
full pensions would prove to be apt 
risk takers, especially with such a large 
safety net to fall back upon. Certainly, 
those with the least to lose would wager 
with something so large to gain.
However, this theory proved untrue. 
Davis explained to me that he found out 
that many were just not willing to take 
any more risks and put in the time and 
effort needed in order to pursue a larger 
goal. It is this very idea of comfort lead
ing to apathy that he reiterated in his 
meeting with me. The lesson of wasted 
opportunity is one that cannot be easily 
forgotten.
To choose this anecdote to pay trib
ute to Davis may seem a tad bit odd at 
first glance. Yet the underlying principle 
found in that story is that ones inspira
tion has to come from within, as achieve
ment is rarely derived from circum
stances alone. His example of those in 
a position to succeed failing to have the 
motivation to do so should serve as a poi
gnant lesson for all to follow. Drawing it 
from within oneself, the motivation to 
succeed must be extracted and utilized.
For those who wish to pay their re
spects, the time has come. According 
to the Heinz School website, A service 
to honor the research, academic, and 
humanitarian contributions of Otto 
Anderson Davis (Toby), will be held on 
Saturday, September 16 at 3:30 p.m. in 
the University Center, McConomy Audi
torium, with a reception to follow in the 
Schatz Dining Room. Instead of intend
ing to, do. See you there.
This September, remember that there 
are many to mourn, and for many reasons.

Presidential
Perspectives
Explaining 
a definitive 
new agenda
______________Karl Sjogren
Another year, an actual 
agenda. Its unfortunate, but 
previous administrations left 
student government with a bad 
rap: Were the do-nothing-ers, 
the do-littlest-ers or the dothey-do-anything-at-all?-ers.
Times have changed. The new 
rule for campus: We are here to 
serve you. This week, weve al
ready met with, counseled, or ad
vised over a half-dozen students; 
topics from starting a StuCo to 
setting up a University Exchange 
Program. Have an idea? Wed 
love to hear from you.
But were more than just an 
information source. We want to 
shape this campus into some
thing better, too. This is just a 
preview, but here are a couple 
key areas wed like to focus on 
over the coming year:
Making more space available 
for student organizations:
We have a severe shortage of 
multi-purpose space on cam
pus. Rooms that could be used 
for rehearsals, practices, per
formances, and meetings are in 
short supply. We plan on explor
ing what can be done to create 
more space across campus.
Student activities fee:
With your vice-president for 
finance, Kirk Higgins, we plan 
on introducing several new ini
tiatives that will improve organi
zations financial accountability 
and increase monies available 
to student organizations without 
an initial increase in the activi
ties fee.
Student leader caucuses:
With the help of sophomore 
Nelson Cheung, well be launch
ing a new dinner series that will 
bring together student leaders to 
discuss their campus and organi
zational concerns while offering 
them useful, concrete skill sets 
to help them better manage their 
organizations.
Presidents Multi-cultural 
Action Campaign (PMAC):
Well be launching a new ini
tiative, spearheaded by Rachelle 
Emard, which will work to en
gage multi-cultural student 
leaders to achieve their vision 
for their organizations and the 
campus community. The cam
paign will provide multi-cultural 
organizations leadership with 
the valuable campus-focused 
skill sets and logistical know
how theyll need to achieve this 
vision. Interested in joining our 
team? Send us an e-mail.

McCandless
At 8:47 p.m. on September 7, 
I thought about deactivating my 
Facebook account.
Dont misunderstand this 
News Feed: I didnt think about 
really deleting my Facebook 
profile and destroying my elec
tronic social network, thereby 
preventing hundreds of people 
from knowing that tap dancing 
in inappropriate places is among 
my interests. I just thought about 
deactivating my account.
If I were to actually leave Face
book, I would miss out on the 
very dialogue of my generation. 
A dialogue that says, among 
other things, When presented 
with a seeming violation of our 
electronic privacy, we will unite 
in throngs! and Sorry for the 
poke  hope it didnt hurt.
Had I really quit Facebook, 
I wouldnt have gotten to read 
one of the most formative texts 
of my college career: An Open 
Letter by Mark Zuckerberg. (It 
should be noted that his Open 
Letter is significantly more sta
ble than Marks first draft, Its 
Complicated.) In it, Facebook 
creator Zuckerberg alludes to 
the uproar his newest venture 
News Feed caused, saying, We 
really messed this one up (em
phasis added). It doesnt matter 
whether or not you are one of 
the three-quarters-of-a-million 
students who joined the official 
group against the News Feed.
What matters is how willing you 
are to elect Mark Zuckerberg to 
public office  because that is 
surely where he will end up in 
the very near future. After all, 
he can spread blame around like 
a practiced politician and still 
end his statement by signing off 
with a charismatic Mark. What 
a guy.
But really, An Open Letter 
by Mark Zuckerberg proves a
significant' point  that ___
our generation united in 
a common voice, a voice 
heard by people across the 
country. People like the 
staffs of Time magazine 
and CBS News. People 
with jobs that involve cov
ering wars and uncovering ------
political scandals. People 
who understand even less what 
a poke is.
In a matter of days, hundreds 
of thousands of college students 
united around something they 
felt strongly about  and it 
made a difference. Even though 
An Open Letter by Mark Zucker
berg states that the News Feed 
will continue, it will do so with 
students greater control over 
their personal information. We 
drew national attention to our 
discontent and proved that our 
generation is not an entirely apa
thetic one. But before we raise 
our collective fist in the air and 
yell a mighty Howard Dean-like 
Yeaaaahhhh!  think about 
it. Unlike the generations of yes
terday who stood up for issues 
such as racial discrimination 
and womens rights, our genera
tion rallied around the fact that 
Zuckerberg took the work out 
of stalking former significant 
others.
We can do better than this. We 
can start by voting.
Lets take advantage of this 
new breed of democracy by call
ing attention to more pressing 
issues than our online social net
work. After all, shouldnt we be 
fully educated on current events
on, singing a friends wall  even 
untagging drunken pictures  
they have presumably accepted 
the terms-of-service changes 
that Facebook quietly intro
duced last month. Among these 
terms-of-service agreements is 
that of the Facebook Develop
ment Platform. This provides a 
way for third-party software de
velopers to copy large portions 
of the Facebook database  porMark Zuckerbergs assumption that we want 
to have our information shared is like Michael 
Heckuva Job Brown assuming that all those 
New Orleanians wanted \o be under water.
thanks to the News Feed? In his 
An Open Letter by Mark Zucker
berg, Zuckerberg himself even 
states that, When I made Face
book two years ago my goal was 
to help people understand what 
was going on in their world a lit
tle better. Too bad Zuckerberg 
thinks the most important thing 
in a students world is knowing 
that a high school friend joined 
the club I <3 Taco Bell! at 4:19 
this afternoon.
Thanks for the try, Mark, but 
the news you tell us isnt what 
we need to understand. Its not 
what we need to know.
Or is it?
Among the sparsely relevant 
things Mark Zuckerberg tells us, 
a few notably discreet pieces of 
information are truly important 
for students to know: By logging
tions such as your name, your 
profile picture, your gender, 
your friends, your interests, your 
photos, your hometown location, 
your current location  the list 
goes on.
But dont worry, obsessive 
Facebook checkers! Team Mark 
has taken steps to protect your 
privacy  they have drawn up 
a contract with said third par
ties. And a contract has got to be 
binding, right? Wake up, sleeping 
naive! Its 1984... I mean 2006! 
In these days, a contract is as 
about as binding as the relation
ship status on your profile. The 
Privacy Policy clearly states that 
We have undertaken contrac
tual and technical steps to re
strict possible misuse of such in
formation by such third parties, 
but of course cannot and do not
guarantee that all third parties 
will abide by such agreements.
If the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire 
were drawn up that shoddily, 
residents of Haifa would still be 
biding their time in bomb shel
ters.
My friends, prevent yourselves 
from engaging in unprotected 
information sharing by cancel
ling your assumed relation
ship with Mark and his cohort.

on the left menu bar, (2) 
find everyone and click 
edit settings, (3) find 
the check box marked 
my information may be 
used according to the re
stricted terms of service, 
and (4) uncheck the box. 
Zuckerbergs assumption 
that we want to have our infor
mation shared is like Michael 
Heckuva Job Brown assuming 
that all those New Orleanians 
wanted to be under water.
If nothing else, we have 
proved that, as long as we stay 
actively aware of what truly mat
ters in our world, our generation 
can make a difference. We will 
unite! We will stand up for what 
we believe in and see to it that 
our voices are heard. And then

Katie Fisher (#3) and Malena Yablinsky (#6) reach for the volleyball during their game Wednesday.
again last weekend as they trav
eled to Cincinnati to compete at 
Mount St. Josephs Invitational. 
They came away from the week
end 1-3.
Opening strong, the Tartans 
swept Thomas Moore 3-0 on Fri
day night (34-32,30-24,30-28). 
Toney posted 12 kills, followed 
by Bradfords 10 kills and 17 digs. 
Carlock and Carter each had 17 
assists during the match.
[Thomas Moore] was a good 
game for us to start off with, 
said Fisber. We came out strong 
and ... were strong through the 
match. Our biggest asset is our 
energy and excitement.
However, the Tartans winning 
streak ended in their next match 
against Juniata College, ranked 
first in the nation.
Juniatas been consistently 
ranked number one or top five in 
the nation for years, junior mid
dle hitter Becky Metier said. We 
were just happy we showed them 
what we were made ofwe held 
a lead for a couple of points in 
each game.
Although losing all three games 
of the match (30-25, 30-25, 30- 
17), Toney added nine more kills 
to her weekend total and Carter 
led the team with 11 assists. We 
fought hard in this game, and I 
think the scores reflected this,
Fisher said.
The second day of the tourna
ment proved to be frustrating for 
the Tartans, who took on Whit
man College and Capital Uni
versity and fell 3-1 to both the 
Missionaries and the Crusaders. 
Saturday was just frustrating, 
Metier said. Wed have a lead, be 
playing really well, [but] then an 
unforced error would cause us to 
lose the momentum.
Against Whitman, Fisher led 
the team with 22 kills, followed 
by Toney with 13 kills and Yablin
sky with 12. Carlock and Carter 
led the squad with 28 and 21 as
sists respectively. Against Capi
tal, Fisher again led the Tartans 
with 22 kills and Carlock.
We just had some communi
cation errors and thats usually 
the case with the beginning of 
the season especially when there 
are new people on the court, said 
Fisher. This is going to be ironed 
out within the next few weeks.
After an up-and-down start to 
their season, the Tartans will re
turn home on Thursday to face St. 
Vincent College at 7 p.m.
We have a very talented team, 
and a lot of [the] season left, so 
well see what happens, said 
Metier. Hopefully we can pull it 
together, and if we do we can be 
very successful.
VOLLEYBALL, from A20
recorded 16 kills. Other notable 
performances included those of 
senior co-captain Kat Fox, who 
came up with 13 digs, and firstyear setter Samantha Carter, who 
had 38 assists throughout the 
match.
After a weekend of frustration, 
the Tartans rallied to pull out their 
first win of the season, defeating 
Ithaca College 3-1. After losing 
the first game, the Tartans came 
back to win the remaining three 
(30-19,30-23,30-24). Toney led 
the team with 14 kills.
Building on their momentum 
from the Ithaca match, the Tar
tans shut down Geneva College 
3-0 in their home opener in Skibo 
Gymnasium Wednesday night.
Wednesday was a great step
ping stone for us, Fisher said. I 
just love playing at home.
In the first game against Ge
neva, Toney and Yablinsky each 
had three kills for a final score of 
30-17. During the second game 
(30-22), senior outside hitter 
Amanda Bradford led the team 
with seven kills. Fisher had col
lected four kills in the final game 
to lead the Tartans to a 30-19 fin
ish over the Golden Tornadoes.
The Tartans were on the road

SPORTS COMMENTARYAn ode to sports
Doug Fricker
Without sports, what would 
men do on Thanksgiving after
noon or New Years Day?
You may not realize it, but 
sports affect each and every 
one of us. Yes, that even in
cludes you, the computer sci
ence major who never leaves 
Wean Hall. Doubtful? I have 
five words for you  Capture 
the Flag with Stuff.
Sports shape our identity. 
They add to our lives in ways 
we dont even realize. It might 
be the bonds formed while 
watching a game with others, 
or the excitement you experi
enced while rooting for your 
favorite team to win the cham
pionship.
Without sports, a broken leg 
of a horse wouldnt make front
page news and nobody would 
care if Ben Roethlisberger 
didnt wear a helmet while rid
ing his motorcycle. Without 
sports, a Hail Mary would just 
be a prayer and no child would 
be named Espn (there are at 
least three).
For most of us, sports are 
about the competition or the 
completion. Humans like to 
compete, and we gaip satis
faction from completing races. 
People like to win, so if there 
were no more sports for people 
to win, theyd have to resort 
to other outlets for winning, 
like board games or political 
offices.
Without sports, New Yorkers 
and Bostonians might actu
ally get along. Without sports 
you could just say youre from 
Chicago and not have someone
ask Northside or Southside?
When we were young we 
looked Up to and practically 
worshipped our favorite play
ers. They were our role models, 
and we wanted to grow up to 
be just like them. We would be 
outside dreaming of hitting the 
game-winning home run in the 
bottom of the ninth or making 
the game-winning shot at the 
buzzer.
Sports bring people together 
and give them hope. Sports are 
the only thing some kids have 
going for them.
In the middle of August, a 
judge in Kenton, Ohio, delayed 
the jail sentence of two high 
school athletes guilty of steal
ing a decoy deer and causing 
a car crash by placing it on a 
country road. He ruled that 
they could complete their foot
ball season this fall before serv
ing time at a juvenile detention 
center.
Without sports, you wouldnt 
be able to get an eagle or a 
birdie with only a driver and 
an iron.
Without sports; a strike 
would only be done by union 
workers and a spare would 
just be found in the trunk of a 
car. A shotgun wouldnt be a 
formation; it would just be a 
weapon.
Without sports, Mark 
Wahlberg wouldnt be invin
cible and nobody would re
member the Titans, but we still 
would have had it with those 
snakes on that plane! Nobody 
would pay for a book written 
by Jose Canseco, and tailgating 
would only be done while driv
ing a vehicle.
Without sports, a touch
down would only be some
thing planes do, a quarterback 
is something youd get from a 
vending machine, and a shelf 
would just be a shelf. A turn
over would either be apple or 
cherry and a hat trick would 
only be done by magicians.
Wed have no Lambeau 
leaps, no rally monkeys, no ter
rible towels, no coin flips, no 
Gatorade showers, no shaving 
cream pies, no yellow jerseys, 
no green jackets, no One 
Shining Moment, no helmet 
decals, no octopus toss, no side
line reporters, no Sportscenter 
is next, no Great Bambino, no 
Splendid Splinter, no He Hate 
Me, no Immaculate Reception, 
no Miracle on Ice, no Cameron 
Crazies, no guaransheeds, 
no seventh-inning stretches, 
no Rumble in the Jungle, no 
Thrilla in Manila, and March 
wouldnt be mad!
Andre Agassi would just be 
bald, Warren Sapp would just be 
fat, and John Madden wouldnt 
have a job, anywhere.
Sports can reach a global 
scale too. Angola qualifying for 
the World Cup showed there 
is more to the African country 
than oil, war, and poverty. The 
Olympics are a time for all the 
countries of the world to come 
together as one and brush aside 
their differences.
Without sports, Pittsburgh
ers wouldnt have anything to 
riot about, you wouldnt have 
a reason to wear body paint 
on a Sunday afternoon, and 
lastly, I wouldnt have anything 
to write about.
Heres to sports.
Mens soccer handily wins first three
SOCCER, from A20
which tops the school all-time re
cord.
Witn four senior starters hav
ing graduated from last years 
team, including three defenders, 
the Tartans are relying heavily 
on some fresh faces to contrib;urte to the 2006 season. The five 
first-years in the starting lineup, 
coupled with the seniors, present 
a balance of young and old to the 
team.
Coming into the season we 
were kind of nervous because we
lost all of our defense, Schlough 
said. We have a great freshman 
class so were all really excited 
about that, and fortunately weve 
been able to fill up some holes 
that we really needed to take care 
of.
We hope to perform well in 
all of our conference and non
conference games, hopefully win 
conference, and show well in the 
tournament  nothing short of 
that, Park said. Were playing 
good soccer now. Hopefully we 
can keep everything together, 
stay healthy.
Schlough added, The UAA 
games will be huge, so, as senior 
leaders, were going to try and 
prep the younger guys and make 
them understand how big those 
games are. Were starting to pass 
the ball around a lot more, occa
sionally we hit some bumps here 
and there, but its going well so 
far and were all coming together 
really well.
The mens soccer team travels 
to Grove City College on Tuesday 
before returning home to face 
Juniata College on Saturday at

FOOTBALL, fromA20
ered by the offensive line, began 
to overwhelm the Wolverines 
defense. Touchdown runs on 
consecutive drives of 70 and 78 
yards gave the Tartans a 16-0 
lead at the end of the first half.
If you look at the stats, we 
sprayed the ball around with 
Gimson, Sivek, Colby [Whitman], 
and Jon [Cakert], Lackner said. 
We were very pleased with the 
balance offensively.
While the offense ate up the 
clock in the first half, the Tartan 
defense held Grove City to just 
89 yards with three of four drives 
consisting of three plays or less.
For the most part we were very 
disciplined, and a lot of what they 
were trying wasnt working, said 
senior linebacker Aaron Lewis 
(8 tackles, 1.5 tackles-for-loss), 
whose second-quarter forced 
fumble ended a Grove City drive 
and led to the Tartans second 
touchdown of the game. There 
were a few series where. they 
found a few things, but we were 
able to adjust to it pretty well and 
shut them down.
Grove Citys biggest scoring 
attempt came in the third quar
ter. Led by first-year quarterback
Andrew DiDonato  the West
ern Pennsylvania Interscholastic 
Athletic League record holder for 
passing yards  the Wolverines 
put together a 16-play, 77-yard 
drive that led to a first-and-goal 
at the one. But when senior line
backer Jaime Ploetzer stripped 
Grove City running back Matt 
Weil, senior defensive back Jona
than Menhart recovered the ball 
and preserved the Tartans shut
out, the first over the Wolverines 
in 23 years.
Thats a very cool stat, Lewis 
said. Its usually been a very 
close game, but we always try 
and go for the shutout. And they 
came close a few times, but you 
make plays like that fumble on 
the one-yard line and youre able 
to keep the shutout.
Although the defense will get 
the praise for the shutout, both 
defense and offense seemed to 
feed off each others success.
I thought the defense played 
good but the offense kept us off 
the field, said Ploetzer, who re
corded six tackles and a half-sack 
in addition to a forced fumble. 
All the credit goes to them; they 
controlled the ball.
In addition to churning out 478 
yards of total offense, the unit
produced 26 first downs, did not 
turn the ball over, and converted 
10 of 14 third-down opportuni
ties.
Its a feather in our cap, added 
senior guard J.P. White. We 
like to run the ball but to have a 
balanced attack  coming out 
early throwing the ball  really 
got the momentum going.
Special teams also had a solid 
performance for a second straight 
week. Senior kicker Nathaniel 
Greenstein booted a 25-yard 
field goal while junior defensive 
back Jonathan Scholl returned a 
Grove City punt 35 yards to the 
Wolverines 18-yard line, setting 
up the Tartans final touchdown.
The two early-season wins give 
Carnegie Mellon a solid start as 
they open up their home sched
ule next Saturday against West
minster College. And with three 
consecutive home games before 
beginning UAA conference play 
on October 14, the team knows 
that there is a long season ahead 
of them.
Were excited but were tak
ing it one game at a time, White 
said. We want to carry the in
tensity we had this week into 
practice and next week [against 
Westminster].

II September 2006 THE TARTAN A20
Football on 
a roll, wins 
first games
by Adam Lazarus
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons varsity 
football team pushed its record 
to 2-0 with an impressive 28-0 
victory Saturday afternoon 
against Grove City College in 
Grove City, Pa.
Im really pleased. The kids 
played a great game and the 
effort they gave was fantastic, 
said head coach Rich Lackner.
Not only did Saturdays out
put mean that the Tartans 
will open their home schedule 
undefeated, but the victory 
showcased an ability to excel 
in all three phases of the game: 
offense, defense, and special 
teams.
As expected, the running 
game played a large role in de
ciding the outcome on Satur
day. Carnegie Mellon faced a 
Wolverine defense that allowed 
just 2.9 yards per carry last sea
son and an offensive attack that 
rushed for over 150 yards per 
game in 2005.
But the Tartans dominated 
both sides of the ground game 
against Grove City as they had 
in the previous weeks 27-6 vic
tory against Hiram College.
As a unit, the offense rushed 
for 360 yards, highlighted by 
two junior running backs  
Robert Gimson (14 carries, 140 
yards, TD) and Travis Sivek (29 
carries, 131 yards, TD)  pass
ing the century mark.
Sivek, who pounded out 103 
yards and two touchdowns in 
the second half of last seasons 
come-from-behind victory over 
Grove City, moved into fourth 
place on Carnegie Mellons alltime rushing list with 1972 ca
reer yards.
The Tartans, who had more 
than 37 minutes of possession, 
also threw the ball with great 
efficiency. Senior quarterback 
Kevin Mulkern (10 of 13 com
pletions, 118 yards, TD) opened 
the first drive with a 48-yard 
 completion to senior Mark Da
vis, and although that drive did 
not result in points, the play ex
emplified the Tartans balanced 
attack.

gave Carnegie Mellon a 3-0 
lead, the running game, powSee FOOTBALL, page A19
Volleyball 
wins three
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The womens volleyball team 
has been busy during the first 
two weeks of the 2006 season, 
playing nine matches in nine 
days. They came away with 
three wins.
We are still getting used to 
playing with one another, said 
senior co-captain and outside 
hitter Catie Fisher. We are com
ing together well and pushing 
through.
The Tartans opened their 
season at the Ohio Northern Uni
versity Tournament, September 
1 and 2 in Ada, Ohio, winning 
one out of four matches. The Tar
tans faced Hiram College in their 
first match and won the opening 
game (30-19), but then lost the 
next three and lost to Hiram 1-3. 
Fisher and junior outside hitter 
Kate Stepp led the team with 
eight kills apiece. Senior setter 
Brea Carlock added 23 assists to 
the Tartans offense.
Coming off the loss to Hi
ram, the Tartans were unable 
to come up with a win against 
the 19th-ranked Leons of Mount 
St. Joseph College, dropping 
all three games (17-30, 23-30, 
20-30). Senior middle hitter 
Malenda Yablinsky led the Tar
tans with eight kills.
The next day the Tartans 
again fell behind early, losing to 
Ohio Northern University 1-3.

Tartan mens soccer sweeps competition
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
Coming off a 13-win season and an 
NCAA Division III tournament appear
ance in 2005, the Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team began its 2006 season with 
three wins  a good start for the continu
ation of the success they are becoming ac
customed to under head coach Nick Gaudioso.
The Tartans opened their 2006 season 
on September 2 by defeating Geneva Col
lege 3-0 at Gesling Stadium. They fol
lowed that triumph with another home 
victory against the Washington & Jeffer
son Presidents 5-0 Wednesday night, and
edged the Westminster Titans 2-0 on Sat
urday at Westminster.
Against Geneva, senior forward Will 
Schlough got the Tartans on the board 
when he took a cross from fellow senior 
Andrew Park and one-timed the ball into 
the right side of the net.
The Tartans got another goal shortly 
thereafter by first-year midfielder Ryan 
Browne to give themselves a two-goal 
cushion. They were able to maintain the 
lead the rest of the way to lock up their 
first victory of the season.
The Tartans got off to a slow start 
against W&J on Wednesday, but Park and 
Schlough changed that in the 34th min
ute of play when Schlough stole the ball 
and crossed to the wide-open Park, who
threaded a shot inside the right post. The 
Tartans managed to score twice within 
29 seconds right before halftime to take a

three-goal lead into the intermission. They 
added two more goals, this time within 25 
seconds of each other early in the second 
half, to seal the victory.
The Tartans final goal was one for the 
highlight reel. On a crossing pass from se
nior midfielder Sean Filipovitz, Park made 
a diving header that found its way into the 
back of the net. It was a great ball from 
Sean and luckily I could hit it solid, Park 
said.
The Tartans game against Westmin
ster on Saturday afternoon also ended in 
victory thanks to some late-game magic 
between Park and Browne. With under 
11 minutes to go and the game still dead
locked at zero, Park received a pass from 
Browne and punched it into the back of 
the net.
Park returned the favor less than a min
ute later, assisting Brownes first goal of 
the season and the 46th goal of his career,

After two weeks of competi
tion and three games, Carnegie 
Mellons womens soccer team 
finds itself with an odd record: 
one loss, one win, one tie, and 
only three goals to its name.
We are a young team and a 
small team, said head coach 
Sue Willard. Many of our veter
ans lack on-field experience.
The 'women opened their 
2006 season at the Ohio North
ern Classic in Ada, Ohio, on 
Saturday, September 2, against 
Otterbein College. Kept score
less, the Tartans fell to the 
Cardinals 1-0. Otterbeins goal 
was scored in the 24th minute of 
the game when senior defender 
Lauren Thompson scored off a 
corner kick from Kelli Peirano.
The Tartans were unable to 
find the back of the net, although 
they out-shot the Cardinals three 
to two and had 10 corner kicks to 
Otterbeins four. Otterbein goal
keeper Annelise Erpenbeck had 
two saves from shots by sopho
more midfielder Laura Steidel 
and junior midfielder/forward 
Jessica Howard. Tartan sopho
more goalkeeper Christie Adams 
had one save in the game.
The next day the Tartans were 
able to put down Ohio Northern 
University 3-2 to earn thei^r first 
win of the season.
Howard scored the first Carn
egie Mellon goal in the 36th 
minute of the game when she
placed a low shot to the right 
side of the net past the Polar 
Bears goalkeeper, junior Barbie 
Krieger.
Sophomore midfielder Mary 
Ashe made it 2-0 six minutes 
later with a header off a cross 
from junior defender Amanda 
Rose. Five minutes later, Ohio 
Northern senior Diana Smith 
scored the Polar Bears first goal 
off a corner kick.
Ohio Northern first-year Angie 
Pisut tied the game up in the 
67th minute when she converted 
a penalty kick into a goal. The 
Tartans responded, however, as 
Howard scored again seven min
utes later off a pass across the 
middle of the field from junior 
forward Kasey Stever, bringing 
the score to 3-2 and securing the 
Tartan victory.
On Wednesday the Tartans 
faced Westminster College in 
New Wilmington, Pa. Although 
the Tartans out-shot the Titans 
20 to 14 and had 10 corner kicks 
while Westminster had none, the 
Tartans were unable to get past 
the Titans first-year goalkeeper, 
Lindsay Mellott, and the game 
ended in a 0-0 tie. Mellott had 
17 saves during the game while 
Adams had six.
We had our chances, Willard 
said, but we didnt capitalize on 
the chances that we had.
The Tartans have their first 
home game this Tuesday against 
Capital University at 7:30 p.m. atGesling Stadium They are home 
again on Saturday against Ju
niata College at 6 p.m.

New organizations unite
Extracurriculars bring a variety of people together
We are officially back in school. It's time to hit the 
books, but what about extracurricular activities? 
New and returning students alike should beware 
of becoming so rapidly immersed in their studies 
that they miss the opportunity to join in all the new 
student organizations that have blossomed this 
year. New and old, from community service groups 
to, say, the school newspaper, there is a group out 
there for everyone.
Several organizations new to campus this year 
bring a refreshing light to Carnegie Mellon, serving 
to unite the somewhat segregated subcultures 
on campus. They are all interested in melding 
together different organizations and people with 
the intent of providing service to and establishing 
communications with the campus and city 
communities.
Juniors Neha Thatte (industrial design) and Tehana 
Weeks (business administration) founded the 
organization CMU Fusion this year with the intent 
of offering opportunities for akeady-active cultural 
and social organizatons on campus to interact and 
collaborate through tangible established events 
and student engagement, said Thatte. Finally, a 
group is working to unite the Asian cultural groups 
with the Latin dancing groups with the writing 
groups with the acting groups.
Thatte and Weeks vision is that, rather than 
celebrating diversity by focusing on individual 
cultures, our campus should celebrate diversity in 
culture and interests by uniting. They are calling 
for anyone and everyone who wants to bring 
different social groups together, therefore fusing 
all of the branches of activity and interest on our 
akeady-active campus. Describing the idea as 
"truly radical, Thatte sees the club promoting 
"increasingly defined and explorative bouts of 
creativity" as more first-years and returning 
students join and provide their own ideas on how 
to promote cultural fusion campus-wide.
CMU Fusion's main event this year will be a 
general event that will incorporate as many active 
cultural and social groups on campus that are 
willing to participate. Each group can perform 
what it wants and as it pleases, but Thatte said it 
is imperative that each transition must transition 
fully and smoothly into the next act, resulting in 
one seamless, continuous performance." That is, 
different groups will need to work with each other 
to create one complete event for the student body. 
The performance will take place April 8, 2007.
Another important new campus organization is the 
Student Monitorship Academic Advice Resource 
Team (S.M.A.A.R.T.). The idea for S.M.A.A.R.T was 
drawn up by Christine Butler, senior psychology 
major, and Alanna Williams, who graduated in 
the Spring with a degree in social and decision 
sciences. The organizations goal is one that 
will appeal to both first-years and older students
akeady interested and involved in community 
service groups: to raise campus awareness about 
all different forms of disabilities. Members do not 
need to have disabilities to join; rather, the growing 
organizations mission is to educate all students 
and faculty about the presence and characteristics 
of both learning and physical disabilities.
"The members of the organization," said the club's 
president, junior economics major Howard Kim, 
"will benefit by having a community of people at 
CMU who can relate to their experiences and be 
helpful. As the group acquires more members,
Kim said, it hopes to expand into Pittsburgh to 
do community service and to hold workshops in 
which professors can leam more about working 
with students with disabilities. We are always 
looking for new people who can help create new 
ideas, and turn them into wonderful realities," Kim 
concluded.
On that note, the Optimist Club of Carnegie 
Mellon University aims to make our surrounding 
community a better place. Founder and graduate 
student in Public Policy and Management Josh 
Caplan wants to "bring out the best in kids" by 
encouraging Carnegie Mellon students from 
all academic disciplines to give back to kids 
in the Pittsburgh area and simultaneously fuse 
together different social groups on campus. The 
new campus organization is actually a branch 
of Optimist International, which started in 1919. 
Supported and in part sponsored by a local 
Optimist Club branch, Carnegie Mellon's Optimist 
Club will let every student who joins take part 
in deciding how to give back to the children of 
Pittsburgh, thus letting the energy and ideas of a 
diverse group of students become one force set out 
to do good in our greater community.
"Great leadership opportunities are available," 
Caplan noted, "as the club is brand new at CMU 
and officers will come from the new membership 
we acquire." Moreover, "members [will] get the 
satisfaction of making a difference in the lives of 
young people.
CMU Fusion's first body meeting will be Thursday 
at 8:30 p.m. in the New House reading room on the 
first floor. The Optimist Club of Carnegie Mellon 
University will meet today at 5 p.m. in Porter Hall 
A18C.

Carnegie Tech recently revealed its homecoming 
queen candidates. Out of the vast selection of 
gorgeous women to choose from, seven were 
picked to campaign .for the prestigious title. The 
winner was chosen by lucky Tech men, who based 
their decision on the candidates photographs
 and their visits to the fraternities.
With the opening of the fall season, students 
grabbed a celebratory hot dog after the Tartan 
Baseball Club's unlikely two-game sweep against 
Penn State. After years of being dubbed a nonathletic school, Carnegie Mellon reigned supreme 
over one of the nations most competitive teams: 
the New Kensington campus of PSU.
There was something for everyone at the annual 
Activities Fair. Among the new additions to campus, 
organizations was Haven, a gothic club that gave 
out free coffee. Also new to the roster was the 
Senior Classical League, and a Latin club complete 
with toga wearers raising attention in their pursuit 
of new recruits. Old favorites included the Scuba 
Diving Club, the CMU Bowling Team, and the 
Juggling Club, who were admittedly spending 
more time clowning around than studying. Its good 
to know we can all find our niche somewhere.
A study revealed that prolonged Internet usage may 
lead to increased stress levels. As if the workload 
itself wasnt enough, now technology just adds to 
the already chaotic lives of students. In the spirit of 
scientific inquiry, students placed a stress-o-meter 
at the entrance of Wean Hail. The dial broke down, 
but not before it proved the studys accuracy. Did 
we really need a study to prove that CS students 
are at their wits ends?
The printing quota was initiated. While many 
majors that dont use much paper couldnt care 
less, those that do, such as English and history 
majors, were really irked. The $40 quota provides 
for 1600 (duplex) pages, which is equivalent to 
about three medium-sized books. The next time 
a student feels like printing out War and Peace, 
hell have to realize that the paper trail is going to 
cost him.

Matisse and his Sister come to Pittsburgh
Documentary by Carnegie Mellon professor will be shown at Carnegie Museum of Art
Serendipity adds to life a lasting, stubborn reason to believe 
in something magical; if something is serendipitous, it is a 
happy accident. Serendipity brought together Henri Matisse, 
the great 20th-century French painter and sculptor, and a 
young nursing student named Monique Bourgeois. It was also 
serendipity that led Barbara Freed, professor of French studies 
at Carnegie Mellon, to stumble upon the book that would lead 
her to the late Sister Jacques-Marie, as Bourgeois was called 
after becoming a nun.
It is now about five years since Freed stumbled upon the book 
Henri Matisse: La ChapeUe de Vence. The book described 
how Matisse came to take over much of the construction of 
the Vence Chapel. "I thought, 'This must be translated," said 
Freed, "So I spoke to the publisher and got his interest." It 
was her publisher that recommended she meet with Sister 
Jacques, and Freed and the elderly nun began a relationship 
that culminated when Sister Jacques agreed to tell the story 
of her time with Matisse on film in Freed's documentary A 
Model for Matisse: The Story of the Vence Chapel.
"It was Sister Jacques story; I wanted to tell it with her," said 
Freed, recalling the role that Sister Jacques had in bringing 
the story to life. Sister Jacques started out as Matisse's nurse 
in 1941 when he was recovering from intestinal cancer.
The films title comes in part from the fact that Sister Jacques 
modeled for Matisse before she entered the nunnery. "After 
Bourgeois left the artists employ, Matisse called her to 
request that she pose for him, reported the December 2005 
issue of ARTnews. The article says that Bourgeois (later 
Sister Jacques) sat for four of Matisse's paintings. The two 
separated during World War n, but Matisse and Sister Jacques 
reconnected twice more by chance, the last time in Vence 
when Sister Jacques, newly a nun, was sent to work there as 
a nurse. It was Sister Jacques sketch of the Assumption that 
inspired Matisse to make a stained glass window, and the
idea grew until Matisse was designing and creating every 
aspect of the chapel.
This is but a fragment of the entire story, which is illuminated 
by Freeds documentary. The film also contains many visuals 
of works by Matisse (including his decorated letters to 
Sister Jacques) that hadnt been shown until Sister Jacques 
revealed them before the camera. Freeds documentary has 
been shown in the U.S., including screenings at the Met in 
New York and the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. The 
documentary has been shown many times abroad as well.
And soon Pittsburgh will exhibit the film again, in conjunction 
with the display of one of Matisses cut-out works. A Model 
for Matisse: The Story of the Vence Chapel will be shown 
on September 20 at 7 p.m. at the Carnegie Museum of Art. 
Afterwards Barbara Freed will lead an extensive questionand-answer session.
Freed recounted the wide variety of questions she has 
received as she traveled and showed her documentary  
many, she said, focus on Matisses motivation in building 
the chapel and why he considered it his greatest work.
Only those willing to travel, however, are able to see the 
chapel in its full magnificence. Freed's documentary solves 
a piece of that problem, however; "Despite the enormous 
documentation of the creation of the chapel... there was no 
visual documentation of the type that would be afforded by 
a documentary," said Freed, speaking of her motivation to 
create the film.
Freed has close connections to the location of the chapel  
she and her parents lived in Vence while she was in college. 
When she started attending school in Aix-en-Provence she 
traveled between Aix and Vence and the chapel was on the 
way, she said. In France, Freed was surrounded by art by men 
like Matisse, Cocteau, and Chagall. France itself "was in the
midst of this great foment of artistic activity. It seemed there 
was a museum or sculpture or something by one of these 
artists everywhere I went, Freed said.
She describes the process of creating the film as rewarding 
at every step of the way. Freed also mentions that chance 
encounters played a role in how she met her director of 
photography. Freed happened to meet Dana Sardet at the 
50th anniversary ceremony at the Vence Chapel when she 
asked Sardet how to turn on her video camera. I met people 
whose paths never would have crossed with mine, Freed 
said.
Not only will Freed's documentary bring a bit of Matisse 
to Pittsburgh, but a cut-out titled The Thousand and One 
Nights is at the Museum of Art until November 22. Matisse 
created his cut-outs in his later years, and the coupling of the 
documentary about the chapel and the presentation of The 
Thousand and One Nights" will serve as a tribute to his late 
works.
The film serves as one of the few documentations of Henri 
Matisse at work. As Freed described, lovers of art and of 
personal stories like that of Matisse and Sister Jacques will be 
intrigued by A Model for Matisse.

Try Greek for a week
Campus sororities begin Formal Membership Recruitment
What comes to your mind when you hear the term 
"sorority"? Excessive partying and binge drinking? 
Blonde, ditzy airheads? That law that defines any house 
in Pennsylvania inhabited by eight or more females, such 
as a sorority house, as a brothel?
The Rho Sigmas, or recruitment sisters, of Carnegie 
Mellons Greek community are working hard to dispel 
these myths and misconceptions during this years 
Formal Membership Recruitment, or FMR. The Rho 
Sigs, as they are affectionately called, are sisters who 
are temporarily disaffiliated from their houses in order 
to act as impartial counselors who guide potential new 
members through the sorority recruitment process.
Each house must submit 10 percent of its members to 
be potential Rho Sigs, and the Panhellenic Council then 
chooses 24 to be Rho Sigs.
The campus has been plastered with posters urging 
women to "get [their] Greek on and participate in FMR, 
Carnegie Mellon's version of sorority rush. This years 
ad campaign features various sorority women and lists 
the diverse activities in which they participate outside 
of their sororities. Despite their outside commitments 
to residential life, dance troupes, and clubs, their desire 
to "be a part of something big has inspired them to get 
involved in Greek life.
FMR differs from sorority rush at other colleges due 
to its no-frills approach to recruitment. The process 
consists of "parties, during which participants visit the 
houses of each of the five sororities and meet the sisters 
of each house. This gives them a chance to determine 
which sororities are a good fit for them and also gives 
the sororities a chance to meet potential members and 
decide on which ones to invite back. The no-frills aspect 
comes from the Greek communitys effort to make the 
process more about the girls and less of a popularity 
contest between sororities.
This years FMR will last from Wednesday night to 
Sunday. At the end of this period, the women undergoing 
FMR will receive bids, hopefully for houses they want 
to join. Alpha Chi Omega, a newcomer to the Carnegie 
Mellon Greek community, will not be participating for 
the full duration of FMR. As they are new on campus, 
they will take part for the first two days but will hold 
a separate recruitment drive in early October. AJ 
Dinsmore, a sophomore computer science major and 
AXQ member, said, "AXQ nationals have tried this 
method during the early years of other chapters and it 
has worked in the past." AXQ will fully participate in 
FMR next fall.
Concerns voiced by potential new members (PNMs) 
include both the high price of sorority dues and the 
massive time commitment that Greek life has been 
rumored to demand. While the price tag that comes 
with sorority life is, in fact, rather steep, the PNMs (yes, 
another Carnegie Mellon initialism) are assured that 
there are many ways to make these payments as well as 
obtain scholarships. As for the time commitment, FMR 
co-chair Kristen Livesey, a senior science and humanities 
scholar and a vice-president of recruitment for the 
Panhellenic Council, said, "However much time you put
into it, you get out of it. That said, the minimum time 
commitment is an hour per week for chapter meetings. 
Events such as Almost Midnight Breakfasts, Greek Sing, 
and most importantly Booth, although all are technically 
optional, can be massive time sinks.
Working to further dispel common misconceptions of 
sorority rush, FMR info sessions emphasized that hazing 
is not tolerated in any way. The PNMs were assured that 
they wouldn't be asked to do anything that members of 
the sororities arent asked to do.
In the past two years, approximately 180 women have 
registered each year for FMR. However, last year only 83 
of them actually joined sororities. While everyone who 
undergoes FMR is usually placed with a sorority, many 
women either dont meet certain standards  such as 
the GPA requirement (2.25 is the minimum, but some 
sororities have higher requirements up to 2.75)  or 
simply choose to do FMR to meet people without any 
intention of joining a sorority.
Only 90 women have registered for FMR so far this year, 
though FMR doesnt officially begin until Wednesday 
night. However, Marci De Grace, a senior science 
and humanities scholar and fellow vice-president of 
recruitment for the Panhellenic Council, is not worried. 
Usually," she said, most girls dont sign up until the 
recruitment information sessions that occur during the 
week before FMR. If the retention rate remains the same 
as in past years, about 45 percent, Carnegie Mellon's 
sororities will experience their first negative growth rates 
in a while.
The majority of students who participate in sorority 
recruitment are sophomores. De Grace attributes this 
to the fact that FMR occurs quite early in the school 
year, before most first-years have a chance to find 
their bearings. However, half of the women who have 
registered this year are first-years.
The primary aims of Carnegie Mellons sororities are 
to promote leadership, scholarship, and service. Given 
this year's registration numbers, it's possible that pre
conceived notions of Greek life have akeady impacted 
the willingness of Carnegie Mellon women to undergo 
sorority recruitment.

We left you hanging last week - you are probably wondering how 
to break into experimental music, but you dont know where to 
start, right? Theres abstract jazz, musique concrete, noise, drone, 
free improv... what is one to do?
Get your feet wet with a quasi-experimental genre first. IDM 
(intelligent dance music), is a good place to start. IDM fuses 
experimentation with semi-regular beats and some traditional 
melodic sensibility, while retaining some of the strangeness true to 
experimental music and giving it a distinctly electronic flavor. Some 
experimental guys will no doubt turn up their noses at beats, but its 
worth a look.
The obvious place to start is with the release that gave IDM its name
 the Artificial Intelligence compilation (Warp Records, 1992). This is 
required listening for anyone wishing to get into the genre; its where 
IDM started, and though the music has become more varied and 
experimental since then, this album still holds up.
Where to go next depends on where youre coming from. This 
style has a lot of influences, and many artists mix traditional IDM 
with hallmarks of other sounds. Squarepusher uses jazz bass and 
drums (try Ultravisitor); Prefuse 73 (who played on campus recently) 
creates complex hip-hop beats (try Extinguished: Outtakes); Venetian 
Snares created a mix of breaks and classical samples for Rossz 
Csillag Mat Szuletett (he even plays violin on some tracks). People 
familiar with mainstream electronic might try mid-period Orbital (like 
In Sides), which, while, not traditionally considered IDM, is going in 
the same direction. True experimental lovers unimpressed by these 
straightforward albums might find some solace in Autechre, who 
have been abstract since the mid-90s (try Con field}.
No intro to IDM would be complete without a mention of Aphex 
Twin (Richard D. James). As the creator of the genre (which he is, 
in essence, because of his early work), its best-known practitioner 
(due to music videos in the late 90s), and one of the most eccentric 
artists around (he drives a surplus tank), Aphex Twin is a legend in 
his own time. Try Come To Daddy, a short but flawless intro to all of 
his many styles.
Hopefully, you now have a sense of experimental music, if youre 
into it, theres much more to explore - try other labels, for example: 
Skam, Rephlex, Planet Mu, Ttgerbeat6, Schematic, Merck, Fatcat, 
Clear... you might find a new love for music.

Service emerges as important design element
School of Design hosts first annual design conference
Imagine a world where being a patient in an emergency room 
doesnt mean waiting five hours to be seen by a doctor, and 
where navigating through Doherty doesnt mean trudging 
up and down random flights of steps. Now imagine a world 
where Starbucks is self-serve, like your favorite neighborhood 
gas station. What emergency rooms and Doherty lack is the 
same thing Starbucks thrives on: good service design.
Service design is, as most design fields are, a seemingly 
vague, overarching concept. Its kind of complicated, said 
Shelley Evenson, associate professor and director of graduate 
studies at Carnegie Mellon, of service design; "[Services] are 
activities or events, performances, processes. Susan Dybbs, 
a second-year masters candidate in the interaction design 
program, added to the definition: A lot of [service design] has 
to do with improving experiences." Rewind to the Starbucks 
scenario: "Starbucks has a product, but it has a service [also], 
A person has to mediate from product to person; services are 
about these mediations," Evenson' clarified.
The growing service sector of the economy  the part of 
the economy that takes into consideration intangible goods
 reflects growing interest in service design. The global 
economy has shifted from product and communication to 
service-based [design]," said Evenson. Product design made 
a huge impact on the economy in the past few years, but 
now the focus is on design that influences an experience 
and guides a user to a particular result. Service design 
aims to allow users to make their own decisions, but make 
better decisions given specific designs they encounter. This 
concern, and way of thinking, is the latest trend in design.
With that in mind, Dybbs and fellow design graduate student 
James Brommer co-chaired the Carnegie Mellon School of 
Designs first annual design conference, Emergence, which 
took place last weekend. Emergence was held in the world's
largest green building, the David L. Lawrence Convention 
Center in downtown Pittsburgh, and takes its name from 
what it hopes to cover for many years: emerging themes in 
design.
We spent a large amount of time thinking of the conference 
as a service design experiment, Dybbs said. The consistency 
throughout the entire conference shows; everything from 
the website to the signage guiding visitors through the 
convention center to the speakers chosen helped to shape an 
experience that ultimately leaves what is taken away from the 
experience up to each individual.
The conference drew a number of speakers from a number 
of backgrounds and experiences. "We wanted a variety, to 
represent the full spectrum of people involved in service 
design," Dybbs said. In an effort to convey that service design 
encompasses more than graphics and interfaces, people with 
business, education, and design backgrounds were all chosen 
as speakers.
Birgit Mager, professor of service design at Kln International 
School of Design in Cologne, Germany, spoke on Sunday 
about the new Center for Service Design Research at the 
University of Applied Sciences in Cologne. In addition to 
her 10 years of experience teaching service design, Mager 
has extensive experience practicing service design. Mager 
founded Gulliver's, a coffeehouse that offers homeless 
people the opportunity to wash their clothes in exchange 
for work. Gulliver's is now a fully functional coffeehouse run 
independently by the homeless. Gullivers serves homeless 
people, but also designs service through experience," said 
Evenson of Mager's work.
Senior industrial design major Koo Ho Shin reflected on the 
experience of the conference, Its been interesting to see the
various approaches in service design," he said. "It could be all 
about customers, based on user experience research, but it 
could also be a system that is designed to give motivation for 
behavior changes."
Jennie Winhall, a senior design strategist for RED, a design 
firm based in the UK that creates services with and for the 
public, spoke about behavior modification on Saturday. 
Winhall focused on ways to encourage people to take 
preventative measures in their health, with hopes of solving 
problems in health care before they happen.
"Europeans are way ahead of us, Evenson said of the service 
design world. Mager had been teaching service designspecific classes for years in Germany, but it's more rare to find 
a service design class here. Evenson spoke of service design 
at Carnegie Mellon, We know that its an emerging field in 
design. We know theres a lot of interest in it.
Carnegie Mellon already offers industrial and communication 
design majors for undergraduates, and masters degrees 
in communication planning & information design and 
interaction design. The School of Design also utilizes other 
facets of Carnegie Mellon's academic offerings; they offer a 
Master of Product Development degree in conjunction with 
the mechanical engineering department. As service design is 
probably most closely related to interaction design, Carnegie 
Mellon is in a good position to delve more deeply into service 
design. The School of Design increased its hold on the service 
design world by hosting Emergence. Evenson said, I can 
imagine a future where we focus on service.

Beyond Pittsburghs pierogies: Food Week
PASA promotes buying fresh and buying local during their first annual food fest
Summer brings new relationships, experiences, and tastes, 
but here in Pittsburgh, winter comes too soon. Before going 
into that long winter hibernation, take advantage of the 
remaining summer time and the whimsical atmosphere of 
downtown and its surrounding areas. In the midst of trying 
to attain ideal fitness in these short summer months, we 
sometimes forget to satiate our stomachs. Well, be our guest 
and tie that napkin 'round your neck as you sit down to 
experience Pittsburghs first annual Local Food Week.
You may have seen posters throughout the University Center 
and academic buildings for this program, which runs through 
Saturday. PASA, the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable 
Agriculture, has implemented this week-long event to help 
the residents of the area celebrate the local harvest and 
promote local agriculture.
David Eson, PASA's regional director for Pittsburgh, said, Our 
goal is to focus people on the 'buy fresh, buy local campaign 
and encourage participation in Pittsburgh. The reason we 
chose the upcoming week is because this is the annual 
harvest time for most Pittsburgh farms."
This is the second year of PASAs buy fresh, buy local 
program, which attempts to connect local consumers to local 
farms and stores that carry fresh produce. This is part of a 
campaign to create awareness in the region about healthy 
opportunities when it comes to what youre eating. Every 
restaurant and event organized in this upcoming Food Week 
promises to abide by those principles and encourage healthy 
living.
Throughout this week, some restaurants are featuring special 
menus to those who ask. Lucca: Italian Kitchen on South 
Craig Street is one of these venues. It has an outdoor seating 
area so that those who have waited until the last minute 
to grasp Pittsburgh air and culinary experiences can do so 
without hesitation. This is only one of the several restaurants 
that buy locally grown produce for their meals, allowing 
customers to truly taste Pittsburgh. After all, Pittsburgh has 
more than pierogies and fries on your salads. Pittsburgh has 
healthy options, too, which can be founnd nearby in both the 
aforementioned Lucca as well as in Caf Phipps in the Phipps 
Conservatory.
Food Week promises more than special menus at select 
restaurants. The program kicks off Monday at Six Penn 
Kitchen, located in the Cultural District, where they will be 
serving hors doeuvres to all and beer and wine to those of 
age, as an opportunity for people interested in the PASA's 
efforts to socialize. Monday also features chef Derek Stevens of 
Casbah speaking about the traditional fruits and vegetables, 
while also addressing the benefits of butter and chocolate  
Stevens hopes to dispel myths about the typically forbidden 
items. Two other lectures on healthy living support him: Mary 
Barbercheck of Penn State speaks on Monday at the Penn 
Brewery, and Eson speaks at the Schenley Park Visitor Center 
on Tuesday
Also, there will be cooking demonstrations by Sweetwater 
Cookings Gaynor Grant on Tuesday night and Whole Foods 
on Wednesday. Thursday features a hike in Schenley with 
catered supper at Caf Phipps and Friday offers a tour of Barb
Kline's Urban Farm. Looking for something closer to home? 
Mad Mex and a mariachi band will be at the Oakland Farmers 
Market on Atwood on Friday. The cuisine and experience are 
only some of what PASA has to offer.
Eson also highlights Friday as the best opportunity for 
citizens of Pittsburgh to experience the fresh foods, as it is 
their Annual Fall Harvest Dinner, where citizens of Pittsburgh 
can pay a fee of $75 to experience a six-course meal at 
the Carnegie Science Center. The meal guarantees fresh 
ingredients and includes a reception before the dinner to 
learn more about PASA and all of its efforts in the Pittsburgh 
community.
This is PASAs first annual Food Week here in Pittsburgh, but 
for those of you that have not saved up that $75 for the dinner 
at the Science Center, there are plenty of other opportunities 
that PASA presents under its buy fresh, buy local campaign 
throughout the year. "This is not the only thing that happens 
around the year, but [it is] one of the highlights, explained 
Eson. We [also] hope to have a local food week every 
September."
Since this years Food Week is going on right now, build up 
your appetite and give your stomach its last treats of summer. 
Those jeans may not fit so well by the end of the week, but 
you can work it off later. Indulge yourself and sit down to a 
hearty, week-long meal of Pittsburgh's culinary delights.

Carnegie Mellons best-kept secret  and the 
College of Fine Arts recording studio is home to Freestyle, an up-and-coming rapper from Pittsburgh
Justin Brown | Assistant Photo Editor

Youve oohed and ahhed over the rare book section in Hunt 
Library, contributed your own personal millimeter to the 
Fence, and you know the Kraus Campo like the back of your 
hand. Is it possible youve exhausted all the interesting parts 
of Carnegie Mellon? Doubtful. Theres one campus hot spot 
that has eluded almost everyone: the recording studio.
Many students are unaware that Carnegie Mellon even has 
one. Nestled in the basement of CFA, room A6 is not your 
typical classroom or lecture hall. It looks like the real deal, 
similar to the image you probably have in your head from all 
those episodes of Behind the Music. Rainbow-colored wires 
connect computers to monitors to mixing boards, soundproof 
doors make you feel a combination of isolated and cozy, and 
there are plenty of pairs of high-quality headphones to go 
around.
But the scene would hardly be complete without the presence 
of professor Riccardo Schulz, instructor to the College of Fine 
Arts Sound Mastering and Editing and Sound Recording 
classes. Most of the time, you can find Schulz somewhere in 
between a multitude of tasks: adjusting knobs amid a jungle 
of equipment, rigging microphones as needed, and directing 
his students via laser pointer, to name a few. Of his domain, 
the recording studio, Schulz said proudly, "This is probably 
the best kept secret in Carnegie Mellon.
The secrets out
From the acoustics to the equipment, the recording studio 
is an impressive part of Carnegie Mellon and an unlikely 
resource in the city of Pittsburgh. The studio is connected to 
the two recital halls in the College of Fine Arts building, the 
Alumni Concert Hall and Kresge Theater, so that technicians 
can record them from below. Such a setup is unusual as 
studios go, and its great for large sets of performers like 
orchestral groups, which are better suited to play on stage 
than in a recording room.
The recording studio is only four years old. It has occupied 
a portion of the CFA basement ever since the drama 
department was relocated. "Whatever money they did spend, 
they spent very well, said Schulz. The acquired territory, 
spans three rooms: the actual studio, where most of the 
machinery can be found, and two recording rooms, one 
small and one large. Prior to taking his class, most of Schulz's 
students didnt even know the studio was there.
Schulz's teaching philosophy is one of plunging right in to 
new material. In this class I expect you to do professional 
work from the get-go," he told the class. Use all the skills that 
you have. And it was only the first week. Some professors 
have guest speakers. Schulz brings in a guest rapper. Meet 
Freestyle, an up-and-coming hip-hop artist native to the 
'Burgh. He's been working with Schulz for three years now. 
When Schulz dropped by the studio on August 30, Freestyle 
was there to record three tracks off his upcoming album. "This 
is trial by fire today since its only their second class, said 
Schulz to to his guest, who was unfazed by the news.
The cast of would-be sound engineers comprised the 21 
students enrolled in Sound Recording, a class which has no 
prerequisite. Schulz mentioned that the original roster left 
space for 12. I keep encouraging them to drop out," he joked. 
A room full of inexperienced undergraduates was slated to
help record the music of a legitimate performer, and nobody 
saw this as a problem. In the words of Schulz: "There is no s
learning curve. e
How it works 1
Who wants to come up now?" That phrase must have been t
uttered at least a dozen times. Schulz was eager to encourage e
each member of his class to give the recording desk a try. 
Everyone got to participate, and a lucky few were even given t
the opportunity to become a part of the album. Freestyle was t
all in favor of student cameos: Sophomore creative writing j
major Marian Mereba spoke a segment for one of the intros, e
and a slew of male volunteers rapped backup for the last song \
of the night. i
What better way to learn about the process than to do it 
yourself? In the studio, start off by working with tracks. Sound 1
engineers work with several at a time. One track will be the (
song's beat, the prerecorded background music. The next 
track will be the performers main vocals. Freestyle wanted 
to have himself on two tracks at once, the second of which 
is called an ad-lib." This gives an effect standard in many 
of today's songs where the artist can be heard singing two 
different things at the same time. The student contributions 
were also put on separate tracks.
Every bridge, hook, and verse required multiple attempts and 
modifications before either Freestyle or Schulz was satisfied. 
After those changes came mastering, a notoriously difficult 
process. "Mastering is how to make it look like it was not 
made in a recording room, when it was made in a recording 
room, said sophomore physics-drama double major Derek 
Pendergrass. This is where Schulzs expertise really comes 
into play. Hes one of those people that can understand any 
music genre, said Haseeb Qureshi, a class of '06 alum who 
studied business administration and psychology. He's done 
everything. For each project, Schulz encourages his students 
to try mastering tracks on their own, but hes there to relieve 
them when they find themselves in over their heads.
Freestyle was doing Schulz a favor by giving his students 
some real-life experience, but that doesn't mean he didn't 
benefit from the session as well. Recording tracks can be 
incredibly expensive; Schulz estimated that-the work his 
class accomplished during Freestyles visit would have cost 
at least $10,000 through a label. He explained to the class that 
when an artist is signed, most of the money earned goes to 
paying back the label for everything from recording fees to 
hotel rooms. It takes millions of copies for CD sales to become 
profitable; most of the money artists make comes from 
concerts. Schulz recommended Moses Avalons Confessions 
of a Recording Producer for anyone interesting in learning 
more about the business. Its really the artist that gets 
screwed over most of the time, he said.
Introducing Freestyle
Three years ago, Freestyle won a hip-hop contest sponsored 
by local radio station WAMO (106.7 FM). After that, he 
came to Carnegie Mellon for the first time through the Arts 
Greenhouse project, an initiative designed to guide some 
talented young artists of Pittsburgh through the recording 
process. The rest is history: Nurturing what can best be 
described as an unconventional mentor-mentee relationship,

"I J by Sarah Mogin | Assistant Pillbox Editor J
Schulz and Freestyle have been working together ever 
since. He scratches my back and I scratch his," Freestyle 
explained.
The unlikely partnership just goes to show how music has a 
way of bringing just about anybody together. The two share 
the same birthday  November 1  but the similarities 
end there. Schulz in cargo pants, Freestyle with designer 
sunglasses, the two have a kind of comedic shtick going on 
that didnt fail to amuse the Sound Recording class. While 
the 20-year-old artist had both his cell phone and his smart 
phone at his side, Schulz was quick to point out: "I dont 
even have a television." And yet the two work extremely 
well together. One of Freestyles song lyrics seemed 
pertinent: Im a chip off the old block so call me wood 
shavins'."
Freestyles name has a double meaning. For one, he can 
come up with lyrics on the spot with such flow that people 
sometimes assume hes rapping prewritten material. Also,
the name matches his personality; he's extremely versatile. 
Freestyle didnt mind that his technicians were in constant 
rotation, in fact he was all for it. He made a point of asking 
the name of each student every time somebody new took a 
seat at the mixing board.
Whatever Freestyle's doing, its working. Phat magazine 
called him the next Jay-Z, but that's just the beginning.
Hes been on XM since September 1, and hes definitely 
getting signed: His first single is under Sony Epic, but he 
still has a chance to switch before the release of his album. 
The labels are like vultures, said Freestyle, who isn't at a 
loss for options. Additionally, he is looking into collaborating 
with some well-known artists, including Ludacris.
Speaking of collaboration, whenever Freestyle teams up 
with former student Qureshi the two are unstoppable.
We work so fast, said Qureshi, whos been working with 
Freestyle for about a year. Together, they once finished five 
songs in three hours. Qureshi is enthusiastic about what's
to come: This is the best Ive ever heard, he said. And the 
studio itself never fails to inspire. It's literally hands-down 
the best studio in the entire area, said Qureshi.
You might think that hailing from Pittsburgh would count 
as a disadvantage for an aspiring hip-hop artist, but so far 
the city has only helped Freestyle in his effort to attract 
national attention. There has yet to be a big rapper from 
the Burgh, so he has the opportunity to be the first of his 
kind. I want Pittsburgh to come out of everyone's mouth," 
he said. Freestyle would love to have a career that parallels 
that of one of his major influences, Nelly, who became 
the first name in hip-hop to emerge out of St. Louis. Right 
now, when people think of Pittsburgh, they think of the 
Steelers and Andrew Carnegie  maybe someday theyll be 
thinking Freestyle. Hes well on his way, and Freestyle will 
always owe a bit of his success to where he first got started: 
the Carnegie Mellon recording studio.

Hatebreed (bottom) gives homage 
to its forefathers, Exodus (top), 
who laid the foundation for their 
continued decade-long success.
Big Als Metal Shop
Monsters of Mayhem tour lives up to billing
"It is a good time to be an American Metal fan."
This is the thought that raced through my mind as I stood 
before the mighty Exodus last Wednesday. For not only is our 
genre capable of sustaining crossover bands like Hatebreed 
for over a decade, it has also produced an underground 
that is both relevant and reverent of its forefathers. Case 
in point: In celebration of their decade of existence and 
recent commercial success, Hatebreed chose to showcase 
classic bands like Exodus and Napalm Death in their festival 
package. These are bands that have laid a cornerstone in the 
foundation of every American band. Yet, while the number of 
metal" bands has increased exponentially, our attention span 
and disposable income has decreased. So it takes a pioneer 
like Hatebreed to remind us of where this all started.
Exodus, in their thrash metal glory, may be known to lay fans 
only as the group that brought Kirk Hammett (of Metallica 
fame) into prominence. To thrash afficianados, though,
Exodus has remained a vital band over the years, producing 
the classic album Bonded By Blood in 1985, among others. 
After settling on Rob Dukes to take over for the much beloved, 
late Paul Baloff as vocalist, the band has produced one of the 
most belligerent albums of the past year. Shovel Headed Kill 
Machine moves classic Bay Area thrash into the modem era, 
borrowing a tad from newer American Metal bands while 
retaining their classic sound.
Watching Gary Holt's fingers moving at light speed at the 
concert Wednesday brought me back to my high-school 
days, when we would thumb-wrestle over who shredded 
faster. Marty Friedman? Slash? Malmsteen? Yeah, but Holt, 
man... any hesher worth his mullet just had to toss that name 
into the ring. After the turmoil the band has endured in this 
last decade, just being out on the road is a testament (pun 
intended) to Holt's passion for Exodus, and the legacy (sorry
 another bad metal pun) he will leave to the new generation. 
The band was in fine form too. Dukes is a great frontman, and 
confident enough to handle the position. The fact that they 
ended the show with the title track from their newest album, 
to a sea of horns I might add, only goes to show that this 
incarnation of the group can go as far as they want.
Speaking of which, this lineup includes Paul Bostaph, of 
Slayer fame. Having moved aside when Dave Lombardo 
returned to the fold, Bostaph has remained a gentleman and 
made the rounds back in the Bay Area scene. Soft spoken and 
generous, I had a chance to speak with him before the show. 
Bostaph says he stays in contact with the guys in Slayer. 
When it comes to Forbidden, another classic Bay Area thrash 
band he was in, though, I could see his eyes softening a bit. If 
possible, he said, he would love to play with them again, but 
logistics (families, tour schedules) remain an obstacle. Maybe, 
if the universe aligns in just the right way, we could see a 
Forbidden/Exodus show sometime...
In the meantime, we have bands like Hatebreed to carry 
the torch for a new generation. Few bands enjoy the same 
devotion as Hatebreed does from their fans. Perhaps it's the 
uplifting lyrics that carry the downtrodden. The personal 
touch  you can find these guys (even now) at their merch 
booth talking to kids, eyes fixed on theirs as they listen to 
their struggles as if their own. To be called a band of the 
people is one thing; to actually live it is another (I'm thinking 
KISS here as the only other example). I think all of that is 
encapsulated in their honest approach to kids.
With frontman Jamey Jastas latest struggles, he could 
have been forgiven for sinking into a hole and recycling 
their well-polished sound. It would have been easy  a 
Hatebreed breakdown or riff is instantly recognizable by now. 
Instead, Jasta pushes through his emotions, his sadness, 
and lays it all bare for the kids on their latest (although not 
greatest) Supremacy. There are great moments like "Destroy 
Everything and To The Threshold" that translated well 
Wednesday night. It wasnt packed like the last time they 
played Club Zoo, but well attended for a school night. "To The 
Threshold was well received, probably due to its rotation on 
MTV2's Headbangers Ball (also hosted by Jasta); but sadly, 
"Destroy Everything, my favorite time, fell a little flat. Ending 
the night with I Will Be Heard," a wave of hardcore, death, 
grind, and thrash metal fans left the club, spirits refreshed. Is 
there any other reason for seeing a show?
