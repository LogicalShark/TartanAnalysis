Room Draw leaves some first-year students homeless
J.W. Ramp/Photo Editor
The questionable fate of Cathedral Mansions and the creation of new first-year areas have left some current first-years without housing.

Housing and Dining Ser
vices guarantees housing to 
any student who participates 
in the Room Draw process 
each spring. However, as some 
have learned, Housing does 
not guarantee students that 
they will be housed in a timely 
fashion, on campus, of even in 
a room. In past years, first-years 
have wound up in Morewood 
Gardens lounges, standard 
triples that were meant to be 
doubles, the far-off London Ter
race Apartments, and even the 
Wyndham Hotel in Oakland,
With the uncertainty of Ca
thedral Mansions 147 spots 
and the transition to more ex
clusively first-year buildings, 
this years Room Draw, which 
took place from March 24 to 27, 
promised to be as bleak as ever. 
Upperclassmen could no longer 
choose Mudge, Boss, or Scobell, 
all of which became first-year 
only, although students already 
living there could retain for this 
year only. Cathedral Mansions 
made a conspicuous disappear
ance from the list of housing 
options. However, the burden 
eventually fell on the current 
first-years, who were the last to 
participate in Room Draw.
Jason Cho, a first-year whose 
draw number was 744, said, I 
got [to Room Draw] 15 minutes 
before my time. The room was 
pretty full. They said they only 
had a few rooms left, so I sort of 
concluded that I wasnt getting 
a roofti because of all the people 
in front of me.
They did at one point say 
there are no more rooms. They 
made that very clear.
As a result, many current 
first-years like Cho have open 
assignments, the term Housing 
is using for students who do not 
have rooms yet. Housing aims 
to resolve the open assignments 
by June 1.
Cho, who currently lives in 
the all first-year Hamerschlag 
House, received an e-mail of 
reassurance from Thomas 
Witholt, the buildings housefellow, which was sent to other 
residents as well.
Please keep in mind that, if 
you havent already, you will 
get an assignment (unless you 
remove yourself from the list). 
Thats a guarantee from Hous
ing, Witholt wrote in the email. Most likely everyone on 
the list will have one by June 1, 
although thats not a guaran
tee.
Students wanting to cancel 
and reclaim their $300 reserva
tion fee must do so by April 25, 
after which they lose the fee. 
After May 16 at 5 p.m., students 
cannot cancel their housing and 
will be held responsible for pay
ing the fee and for housing.
We are processing cancel-, 
lations daily. We are making 
assignments daily. We are com
municating with the students 
who have received an open as
signment regularly, said Kim
berly Abel, director of Housing 
and Dining Services.
For students with open 
assignments, Housing has 
changed the timetable for the 
cancellation policy.
We provided the students 
who received open assignments 
information about the assign
ment process along with infor
mation about the cancellation 
policy and at what point that 
would impact them, Abel said. 
There is no financial obliga
tion or contractual agreement 
with the student until they have 
received their specific assign
ment and have confirmed their 
acceptance.
The fate of Cathedral 
Mansions and its 147 spots 
is uncertain. The apartment 
building was unavailable for se
lection during the Room Draw

Only a week after her husband 
drew throngs to Soldiers and 
Sailors, Michelle Obama wooed 
a small crowd at Skibo Gymna
sium on Wednesday.
Skibos risers were packed 
with community members and 
students from many of Pitts
burghs universities. The rally 
was staffed by volunteers from a 
number of Carnegie Mellon stu
dent organizations, including 
Carnegie Mellon Students for 
Barack Obama, Student Senate, 
AB Political Speakers, and Col
lege Democrats.
Helping Students for Obama 
lead the crowd in cheers of 
Ready to go was Steve Sovern, 
a professional mediator from 
just outside of Cedar Rapids, 
Iowa, who got excited enough 
about the campaign to travel 
to Pennsylvania and rally for 
Mrs. Obama. Sovern, alongside 
student volunteers, built up a 
palpable excitement around 
Mrs. Obamas speech.
Ive been here since 11 a.m. 
setting up and its been amaz
ing. It feels like [Barack] Obama 
is coming, said sophomore
social and decision sciences ma
jor Rotimi Abimbola, a leader 
of Students for Obama who had 
only a few days to coordinate 
the event.
While the crowd was indeed 
diverse, some students at the 
event questioned the practices 
of Mrs. Obamas event coordina
tors, who handpicked the crowd 
sitting behind Mrs. Obama. Th,e 
Tartans correspondents ob
served one event coordinator 
say to another, Get me more 
white people, we need more 
white people. To an Asian girl 
sitting in the back row, one coor
dinator said, Were moving you, 
sorry. Its going todook so pretty, 
though. iyan rearick 
I didnt know they would say, 
We need a white person here, 
said attendee and senior psy
chology major Shayna Watson, 
who sat in the crowd behind 
Mrs. Obama. I understood they 
would want a show of diversity, 
but to pick up people and to re
seat them, I didnt know it would 
be so outright.

questions 
meal plans

News Editor
- The fate of Carnegie Mellon 
dining is fixed, for the next aca
demic year at least. While the 
university has chosen to renew 
its contract with Parkhurst Din
ing Services, the possibility of 
dining changes as early as next 
spring semester was the topic 
of choice at Thursdays Senate 
Spotlight Series. Representa
tives from Housing and Dining 
Services solicited input from 
the campus community as to 
possible improvements to the 
meal plans and campus eating 
venues.
Kimberly Abel, director of 
Housing and Dining Services, 
said that the Parkhurst contract 
will definitely be renewed for 
the next academic year. She said 
they are open, however, to a 
contract period of just one year 
if students feel strongly enough 
about a change in services.
As Carnegie Mellons con
tracted dining service provider, 
Parkhurst is responsible for for
mulating the meal plan system.
Parkhurst is charged with 
operating all of the University 
Center second-floor venues, in 
addition to Tartans Pavilion, 
Carnegie Mellon Caf, Maggie 
Murph Caf, and Entropy+, as 
well as supervising S Seor, 
Taste of India, Asiana, Mitchells 
Main Street Market, La Prima, 
Gingers Deli and Express, and 
Stephanies.
The Underground, Skibo 
Caf, and the Zebra Lounge are 
all outside vendors. Although 
they provide a set commission 
to Parkhurst for using the meal 
plan system, their operation is 
not under Parkhursts jurisdic
tion.
A contract with a new dining 
provider would affect the meal 
plan system of blocks and DineXtra at all of the venues as well 
as cause dramatic changes in 
the venues operated and super
vised by Parkhurst.
A number of students present 
expressed a desire to meet with 
and explore other contractors in 
other Senate meetings or cam
pus forums.
However, in the meantime, 
students made a number of sug gestions to improve the current 
Parkhurst system.
Students were generally 
pleased with, the expansion of 
the University Center space, 
including the addition of En
tropy-1- and Evgefstos!.

debt as credit card use increases

Stafjwriter
According to a new study, four 
out of five undergraduate stu
dents favor the regulation of ag
gressive credit card marketing 
on college campuses. The sur
vey examined credit card trends 
in students, such as number of 
cards in possession, amount 
of times marketing mail is re
ceived, and the parties respon
sible for paying the bills.
The data, released April 1, 
was gathered by the federation 
of state Public Interest Research 
Group (PIRGs) from October 
2007 to February 2008. The test 
population consisted of about 
1500 undergraduates at 40 uni
versities in 14 different states.
Credit card companies have 
gone to such extents as Facebook advertisements and free 
T-shirts, frisbees, and Subway 
sandwiches, marketed directly 
on college campuses, according
J.W. Ramp/Photo Editor
to U.S. News & World Report.
According to the study, three 
in four students have at one time 
stopped at a credit card market
ing table to consider an offer.
While aggressive, the study 
showed that these efforts are 
paying off, for credit card com
panies at least.
Karrie Song, a first-year H&SS 
major and owner of four credit 
cards, commented on the addic
tive quality of credit cards and 
marketing campaigns.

Official Group G manifesto
Editors Note: The Tartan received the 
following publication anonymously. 
While ordinarily we would not publish 
items such as this, the extreme nature of 
this groups demands and the extraordi
nary prose abilities shown by the writer 
of this manifesto convinced us that it is 
our duty to the Carnegie Mellon commu
nity to publish it, in its original form.
All spelling/grammatical errors were 
in the original.
Nearly three months ago, it came to 
the attention of concerned members of 
the Carnegie Mellon community that 
the course 15-251: Great Theoretical 
Ideas in Computer Science (hence
forth GTI) would once again be offered 
to two hundred students in the spring 
semester. These concerned members 
feel the amount of work required of stu
dents in this course is laughably simple. 
It is the opinion of these community 
members that all ideas in computer sci
ence are great, not just those singled out 
for attention by this course. Thus, these 
community members banded together 
to ensure the course would expand its 
subject coverage to all great ideas in 
computer science adjusting the course 
difficulty as needed.
 This collection of community mem
bers, to demonstrate both their loyalty 
to one another and their fealty to the 
material in this course, decided to refer 
to themselves by a name that encom
passes both: Group G.
About a month ago, the first signs that 
Group G might have to mobilise began 
to appear. A game was played during 
lecture, in which the students had to 
demonstrate their level of knowledge in 
Computer Science. Group G greets the 
idea of such an event with the highest 
praise; to encourage students to learn 
computer science is our highest ideal. 
However, the losers of this game did not 
get an appropriate punishment! Group 
G wonders what the point of the game 
is, if there is no punishment for the los
ing side.
Around this time, Group G also be
came aware that solutions were being 
posted online for any student to read! 
Solutions should be a privilege, not a 
right; accordingly, solutions should be 
distributed to the winners of song and 
dance routines performed for the enter
tainment of the course staff.
Perhaps most alarming to our con
cerned community members was the
fact that many students are taking ad
ditional courses at the same time as 
GTI. The sheer audacity of such an ac
tion greatly offends us. To claim that 
another courses material should have 
priority over the glory of theoretical 
computer science is blasphemy of the 
highest order.
To address the aforementioned is
sues, and other problems Group G has 
with the current class status, the simple 
and reasonable demands of Group G 
are as follows:
1. Tests shall no longer consist of 
easy problems, with trivial titles like 
Repeat after me and A moments 
thought. Great problems should 
require far more than a moments 
thought! Henceforth, all tests will con
sist of no fewer than eight problems, 
each of which should require no less 
than twenty minutes of work for the av
erage TA to complete.
2. Tests will be timed to conflict with 
as many other courses as possible, to 
ensure all students are properly prior
itising their work in this course.
3. Homework assignments should no 
longer allow students to spend a week 
solving problems. Instead, problem sets 
of equivalent difficulty to the current 
homework assignments will be issued 
every day, to ensure all students learn 
how to solve a variety of problems at an 
appropriate rate of speed. Exceptions to 
this daily problem set may be m^de for 
federal holidays, at the discretion of the 
course staff.
4. Solutions shall no longer be posted; 
instead, a weekly talent competition 
will be held, to which the winner will 
receive a copy of the solutions. The so
lutions handed out need not be correct.
5. Losers of games played in lecture 
should be punished with additional 
homework problems.
6. TAs shall no longer hold office 
hours. Group G as a whole does not sup
port this particular measure, but cer
tain elements in our ranks insisted it be 
included in our demands.
7. TAs shall no longer grade home
work; instead, students will grade other 
students homework. The class will still 
be on a curve, though, to encourage 
students to grade each other as harshly 
as possible.
8. If a student completes all of the 
assignments of a given colour, he or 
she may then buy houses to place on
the completed assignments, which in
creases the rent paid if another student 
places their shoe or top hat on the com
pleted assignment.
9. Group G wants a pony. No further 
explanation is necessary.
10. The course staff shall Rick-roll 
the students no less than thrice every 
two weeks. No exceptions to this rule 
shall be made.
11. Should a UEFA Champions League 
match coincide with lecture, one screen 
in the lecture hall shall be used to air 
said match. Appropriate pauses shall 
occur in the lecture to allow goal cel
ebrations. The regions of the seating 
area shall be alternately designated for 
fans of the two sides, to prevent any 
conflict.
12. Group G wants to emphasize 
that we are not kidding about the pony. 
Group G has always wanted a pony, 
except for one member who wanted a 
wolf.
13. This space intentionally left 
blank.
14. The letters p and q will be used 
only to represent prime numbers, for 
clarity. Any other usage, even in text, 
is strictly forbidden, and those who vio
late this ideal will be enalized by being 
hanged, drawn and uartered.
15. Group G wants... a shrubbery!
16. Students shall be required to 
memorize at least 200 digits of pi, so 
that if Group G needs to do calculations 
to higher precision, we can find a former 
student to get a more accurate measure
ment of the areas of our circles.
17. 12 units for a course of this mag
nitude is ridiculous. GTI should be 30 
units, and thus be the entire basis for a 
students semester QPA.
18. Students shall sit randomly in the 
classroom on the first day of classes. 
Each lecture after that, they shall re
arrange according to the rules of some 
cellular automata system; the choice of 
which is left to the students.
19. The 19th demand does not exist. 
Please see Miss Zarves for more details.
20. Group G wants... another shrub
bery! Then, when you have found the 
shrubbery, you must place it here, be
side this shrubbery, only slightly higher, 
so we get the two-level effect with a lit
tle path running down the middle.
21. Eating in class is strictly forbidden 
unless the student has enough to share 
with everyone. If the student does not 
have enough to share with everyone,
Lone wolf: a distressed TA for 15-251, Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science.

Group G understands that these 
measures are harsh, and may slightly 
increase the workload on the average 
student. However, we firmly believe 
that the level of knowledge attained by 
students at the end of this course will 
more than make up for the increased 
investment of time. '

process. Even so, Abel expects 
the housing capacity to stay the 
same, although theres a. short
age at the moment.
We anticipate a housing ca
pacity for the fall 08 that is 
equivalent or greater than what 
our capacity was in fall 07, 
she said. Historically, we have 
accommodated all student de
mand and are committed to do
ing so in the future.
We are currently exploring
expanding our presence in Fair
fax [Apartments] and Webster 
[Hall], as well as our continued 
presence in Cathedral Man
sions. We are exploring all of 
our options in the area adjacent 
to campus.
Abel provided no further ex
planation on Cathedral Man
sions or how extra rooms would 
be found.
She did say, however, that no 
upperclassmen would be placed 
in temporary housing, such 
as the makeshift Morewood
lounge-rooms.
Cho sympathizes with Hous
ing and believes he will eventu
ally get a room, though he may 
not get the room or roommate 
he wanted.
Obviously, I dislike not be
ing able to know that I have 
a room.... At the time, they 
seemed very positive and pro
fessional. Im more concerned 
with getting placed with some
one who I dont get along with. 
As they keep sending me cancel
lation reminders, it sort of feels
like they are hoping or relying 
on me to cancel my housing 
agreement.
Part of the reason for the open 
assignments is the fact that the 
universityls trying to build dor
mitory communities and make 
housing more certain for incom
ing first-years.
The reason behind this 
years process is to ensure that 
as many first-years as possible 
are able to have a similarly com
munity-oriented experience liv
ing with a large number of other
first-years, Witholt wrote.
By fall 2009, Mudge, Boss, 
and Scobell houses will join 
Donner Hall, Hamerschlag 
House, Morewood Gardens E 
Tower, and New House as ex
clusively first-year buildings; 
retention will not be an option. 
By tallying the number of spaces 
in those buildings (available on 
www.housing.cmu.edu), there 
will be approximately 1367 
spaces for first-years, not includ
ing the first floors of Hender
son, McGill, and Welch houses,
also earmarked for incoming 
first-years.
On the other hand, no 
first-years will be given room 
assignments in Resnik, West 
Wing, Morewood A-D Towers, 
Roselawn Houses, and Woodlawn and Margaret Morrison 
apartments.
In those buildings, upper

presidential hopeful Sen. John 
Kerry (D-Mass.), who endorsed 
Mr. Obamas candidacy in South 
Carolina last January. Heinz 
Kerry stressed the similarities 
between Mr. Obama and her late 
husband John Heinz III, the pop
ular senator from Pennsylvania. 
She remarked that she has be
come friends with Mrs. Obama, 
mainly from exchanging mes
sages on their Blackberries.
Mrs. Obama spoke about her 
husbands triumphs over ad
versity throughout his life, fo
cusing on the decisions he had 
made that, she said, set him 
apart from his opponent, Hillary 
Clinton. As the first black edi
tor of the Harvard Law Review, 
Mrs. Obama said, Mr. Obama 
could have been successful in 
the private sector, but chose to
go into community organization 
instead.
When youre given ,the gift 
of advocacy, you dont sell it to 
the highest bidder, Mrs. Obama 
said.
Mrs. Obama stressed how 
her husband has relied on 
regular folks instead of big 
donors. Instead of thousanddollar donations, the Obama 
campaign has raised millions on 
small checks of $20 to $50. Mrs. 
Obama sees this participatory 
attitude as a new trend.
Folks have been engaged in 
a way they have not been be
fore. People sit around the TV 
with their 5-year-olds watching 
debates.
Mrs. Obama was careful to 
note that the Obamas, both of 
whom are Harvard-educated 
lawyers and who together 
own a million-dollar home in
Illinois, grew up under difficult 
conditions.
In my house, there were no

work and sacrifice, Mrs. Obama 
said, speaking of her youth. My 
father did not complain and 
went to work every single day. 
Most of Mrs. Obamas state

enthusiastic support, especially 
the televised crowd, many ol 
whom were long-time fans ol 
Mr. Obama.

Student Senate candidates participate in debate on relevant campus issues
The students touch on such important issues as improving the visibility of student government, making changes to campus culture, bettering student life, and instilling school pride.

reform of student government.
This years annual executive branch 
debate was sponsored by The Tartan. 
The event differed from past years 
as it featured video clips provided by 
cmuTV.
In preparation for the debate, crews 
from cmuTV taped students ask
ing questions, many of which were 
screened before the candidates and 
audience at Mondays debate.
The two candidates for SBVPF were 
the first to take the floor in McConomy 
Auditorium.
Sagar Mehta, a sophomore busi
ness administration major, and Evan 
Osheroff, a junior business admin
istration major, presented different 
strategies to improve the efficiency of 
the Joint Funding Commission (JFC) 
and to better use the student activi
ties fee.
According to Osheroff, the most 
important way to t ransform the JFC 
is through improving of the Budget 
Tracker website, the implementing of 
financial audits on student organiza
tions, and increasing the transpar
ency of the JFC.
Mehta hopes to make his own 
changes to the JFC by reforming 
the process itself through earlier as
signment of JFC representatives to 
student organizations and eliminat
ing the initial step for approval to be 
funded.
According to Mehta, Budget Tracker 
is not the biggest item in need of re
form.
We can counter flaws in Budget 
Tracker by allowing representatives 
time to work with organizations, 
Mehta said. Time is where the solu
tion lies.
This was not the only item on which 
the two had opposite viewpoints.
Mehtas proposal to eliminate the 
need for organizations recognized by 
the Committee of Student Organiza
tions (CoSO) to apply for funding was 
countered by Osheroff.
If we allow all groups recognized 
by CoSO to be eligible for funding, 
we will be opening the door to groups 
who do not have as much interest, 
Osheroff said.
He indicated that the extra step en
sures that only very interested groups 
apply for funding.
Osheroff and Mehta agreed on 
some points, however.
When asked about the
appropriateness of funding religious 
groups, both expressed the opinion 
that as long as a group is not exclu
sive, it deserves funding from the 
school.
Both also expressed hope that more 
organizations will eventually be able 
to procure funding as a result of the 
efficient use of the student activities 
fee and reform of the JFC.
The hopes for next year continued 
as the two pairs of candidates for SBP 
and SBVP started their portion of the 
debate.
We know what we 
are going to do at 
day one we get into 
office.
Pooja Godbole
Jared Itkowitz, a junior business 
administration and Chinese studies 
double major, and Pooja Godbole, a 
sophomore business administration 
major, candidates for SBP and SBVP 
respectively, introduced their plat
form CMUnity. CMUnity is based on 
seven main campus initiatives, each 
with detailed, tangible steps from 
which to start.
These platform ideas address such 
issues as campus safety, extending 
the hours of campus venues, instill
ing university pride, and expanding 
the influence of student government 
to the Pittsburgh community.
Dorian Adeyemi, a junior public 
policy and management and inter
national relations double major, and 
Alex Short, a junior chemical engi
neering and biomedical engineering 
double major, candidates for SBP and 
SBVP respectively, presented a very 
different platform.
They insisted that although based 
on change, accountability, and pride, 
their platform ,does not have specific 
goals as they hope for the input of stu
dents to define their initiatives.
Itkowitz and Godbole said that they
have tangible steps for each of their 
initiatives, which they believe will 
lead to an effective year in office.
We know what we are going to do 
at day one we get into office, Godbole 
said.
Adeyemi and Short insisted that 
their platform will ultimately benefit 
the students more than a previously 
decided set of initiatives.
Both pairs of candidates recog
nized that, for most issues, change 
will come in small increments, rather 
than large modifications.
The change in student government 
visibility will not happen overnight, 
Itkowitz said.
Itkowitz has made such small 
changes in his role as chair of Student 
Senate during this past year, initiat
ing both the Senate Spotlight Series, 
where students, faculty, and admin
istrators are invited to discuss im
portant campus issues, and a student 
government visibility committee. 
Itkowitz also strived to create a full 
Senate, including 12 members at 
large, Senate members who contrib
ute to discussions without voting.
When asked about their feelings 
on changing campus culture, the two 
pairs of candidates had contrasting 
opinions.
Adeyemi and Short hope to trans
form the community through regular 
events such as last years free Ritas 
and bicycle spray painting day, in 
which over 700 students gathered on 
the Cut to decorate bikes provided by 
the student government.
However, Itkowitz and Godbole 
maintained that it is more, important 
for students to have pride in all that 
Carnegie Mellon offers.
Itkowitzmentionedthatafraternity, 
newspaper, or student organization at 
Carnegie Mellon is dramatically dif
ferent than one at another university, 
and that this is something students 
should appreciate.
While the candidates had con
trasting opinions on many issues, 
both agreed on the importance of 
the campus knowing about student 
government and the SBP and SBVPs 
ability to keep informed of student 
ideas and opinions.
The elections began yesterday at 6 
p.m. and will officially end Tuesday, 
April 8 at 6 p.m. Paper balloting will 
be available in Wean Commons in the 
University Center, and students can 
vote online at stugov.andrew.cmu. 
edu/elections.

Students share suggestions for improving dining and meal plans
mm, from A1
We created different entities 
to market different nutrition and 
tastes, said Ryan Rearick, direc
tor of Dining Services.
However, students complained 
about the pricing and food selec
tion at Entropy-!-.
Some expressed concern that 
the markups at Entropy-f were 
going too far.
Annually, we will be doing 
price comparisons and they will 
have to give us their mark-up ra-. 
tio. Hopefully we will be able to 
regulate them, Abel said of Entropy+.
Another issue that students 
brought up is that Entropy-f- does 
not offer some of the popular 
brands that the previous Entropy 
had regularly carried,, such as 
Pepperidge Farm.
Abel said that the dining office 
will be looking into acquiring 
Pepperidge Farm products and 
others that are no longer avail
able.
However, the concerns of stu
dents went beyond their favorite 
food brands.
A large topic of discussion was 
the way in which food is paid for.
First-years complained par
ticularly that they are not able to 
convert their leftover meal blocks 
into DineXtra.
Addressing this issue, Abel
cited the need for blocks to 
create financial stability and 
projections for the eating venues 
as well as a way to ensure that 
first-years are eating a healthy 
and well-balanced diet.
Students of all years com
plained of high pricing for meals 
at $6 or more and a lack of small 
meals or parts of meals available 
for $3-$4, as they are at the Tar
tans Pavillion.
Some mentioned that the qual
ity of the food is key, not only 
in ensuring fair pricing, but in 
providing for the campus com
munity.
We have a great variety, said 
Rotimi Abimbola, a sophomore 
social and decision sciences 
major and chair of the Student 
Senate Business Affairs commit
tee, We just need to check on the 
quality and make sure that it is 
always the same each day.
Abimbola mentioned Gingers 
as an ideal eating venue.
Other students expressed in
terest in seeing the nutritional 
breakdown of the food available 
at each venue.
However, one of the biggest 
concerns across all students 
seemed to be the lack of dining 
facilities open 24 hours a day.
Abel mentioned that the major 
obstacle to this mission would be 
with staffing.
The majority of our workers
use Pittsburgh transportation, 
and since it does not run for 
certain hours in the night, they 
would have no way of getting to 
their shifts, she said.
While Abel could not com
ment on the specifics of how 
such a plan would work and with 
what venues it would be tested, 
she said that if dining offices 
was committed to the 24-hour 
mission and ensured of the stu
dents support, they could begin 
a test run as early as next spring 
semester.
Abel reiterated to students the 
many ways in which they can 
share their opinions with Dining 
Services.
E-mails sent to plaid@andrew 
go directly to Abel and Rearick. 
The address is meant for students 
to ask questions, make sugges
tions, or seek further information 
on anything related to dining.
In addition, the Dining Advi
sory Council is open to students, 
faculty, and staff who want to 
share their dining experiences 
with the dining office through
out the school year.
The representatives from 
Housing and Dining Services said 
they would take the student con
cerns back to their office and to 
Parkhurst where they will thor
oughly review them. There is no 
set date for the announcement of 
any future improvements.
Glenn Stroz/Photo Staff
Kimberly Abel, director of Housing and Dining Services, spoke on the renewal of the Parkhurst contract for 
next year while soliciting studnt opinions for the improvement of the current meal plan and dining facilities. 
Abel addressed issues such as 24-hour venues, meal pricing, and markup ratios.
College students favor regulation of credit card marketing on campuses
ifuldey fromAl
many of whom are regularly in 
debt.
George Loewenstein, a pro
fessor of social and decision sci
ences, warned students against 
the hidden dangers within credit 
card bills.
There should be regulation of 
deceptive marketing, but there 
should also be regulation when 
it comes to hidden fees, interest 
rates, and other aspects, Loew
enstein said. The worst devel
opment at the moment is credit 
cards that allow one to borrow 
automatically against ones re
tirement saving.
Christine Lin, a first-year in
formation systems major, echoed 
Loewenstein and spoke of the 
consequences associated with 
credit cards.
People arent educated 
or aware of either the conse
quences or benefits of credit 
.cards. If youre not careful, youll 
graduate college with mounds of 
debt on top of your owed tuition 
money, Lin said.
The data suggested an aver
age debt of $1301 and $2623 for 
college first-years and seniors, 
respectively.
Sometimes students parents 
pay their bills and similarly pay 
for their credit cards. College is
the transition from being a de
pendent of your parents to an 
independent adult that must pay 
her own bills, Lin added.
The study estimated that 30 
percent of students surveyed 
had their credit card bills paid by 
their parents while the remain
der paid out of their own pocket.
Due to this growing trend of 
credit card possession, a num
ber of universities are ipaking 
an effort to educate students on 
how to manage credit card bills, 
according to U.S. News & World 
Report.
The University of North 
Texas opened a Student Money 
Management Center that offers
prizes such as free food to con
vince students to attend free 
financial seminars and work
shops.
At Pennsylvania State Uni
versity at Erie, students in 
their required first-year semi
nar programs receive credit 
management training.
However, according to Loe
wenstein, student education on 
credit cards can only go so far.
I dont think the problem is 
that people dont understand how 
they work, just as the problem 
with cigarettes isnt that people 
dont understand they are addic
tive and harmful to your health. 
The problem is that people think
that they will be able to keep 
their spending under control, 
but credit cards make it too easy 
and too tempting to lose control 
of spending, Loewenstein said.
Song shared a similar opinion 
to Loewenstein, in that outside 
regulation or education has its 
limits.
I feel that regulation is no use 
because if students are irrespon
sible with their money they will 
have to learn sooner or later the 
consequences of mismanage
ment, she said.
Robyn Dawes, a professor of 
social and decision sciences, sug
gested a paternalistic approach 
to college students obtaining
credit cards.
According to Dawes, if a stu
dent really wants to go through 
with the initiative, he or she will 
defy the default option and will 
thus have to deal with the conse
quences.
Consequently I am in favoi 
of allowing students to obtain 
credit cards if they wish to do 
so by taking action  but not in 
favor of their getting credit cards 
automatically, he said.
No matter what approach one 
may take on credit card posses
sion among todays youth, the 
study has made it clear that this 
topic is an extremely relevant 
one for todays college students.

Study finds patterns 
of infant abuse
According to a report by the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, one in 43 infants in 
the United States is abused or 
neglected each year. The study 
reported that 91,278 infants 
were physically abused or ne
glected in 2.006, 29,881 of them 
before they were a week old.
For the purposes of the study, 
abuse was defined as beating, 
kicking, biting, burning, or 
shaking a child, while neglect 
included abandonment, drug 
use, or failure to provide basic 
housing, food, and clothing for 
a child.
The study is the first of its 
kind, and thus researchers were 
unable to tell whether this rate 
is increasing or decreasing. 
They did say, however, that pat
terns of abuse and neglect are 
preventable.

University censors 
abortion searches
Computers at Johns Hopkins 
University were programmed 
to ignore the word abortion in 
database searches.
The database, known as 
Popline, is funded by the Agency 
for International Development; 
the agency also removed two 
articles about abortion advo
cacy because they clashed with 
the criteria of the database.
The dean of Hopkins Public 
Health School, Michael J. Klag, 
immediately lifted the restric
tions once he became aware of 
them. Klag also mandated that 
the databases original settings 
be restored.
Those who complied with 
the agencys restriction stated 
that the database was federally 
funded and should be subject to 
any restrictions in accordance 
with the federal governments

Genes are linked to 
lung cancer
Predisposition to lung cancer 
is genetic, scientists reported 
after finding a chromosome 
containing genes associated 
with the disease.
Of three separate studies 
published on Wednesday, two 
stated that the genes increase a 
persons risk of contracting lung 
cancer, regardless of whether or 
not the person smokes.
The third study concluded 
that the genes make a person 
more likely to smoke, therefore 
inducing behavior that leads to 
lung cancer.

Experts encourage 
hands-only CPR
Hands-only CPR is as effec
tive as standard CPR for adults 
who go into cardiac arrest, the 
American Heart Association re
ported. This new form of CPR 
involves repeated quick presses 
on the victims chest, as op
posed to the traditional mouthto-mouth technique.
Doctors hope that people will 
be more likely to help a victim 
needing CPR if they know they 
can perform a technique less in
timate than mouth-to-mouth.
Experts recommend 100 un
interrupted chest presses a min
ute until medical help arrives. 
They also stress that the new 
technique is for adults only, and 
that children in need of CPR 
should only receive mouth-tomouth.

LEGO is perhaps the most uni
versal childhood activity; genera
tions of children have been enter
tained by the little plastic blocks 
that can be put together to form 
absolutely anything. However, 
the all-time favorite toy now has 
a high-tech competitor created by 
none other than Carnegie Mellon 
specialists.
Designed by graduate student 
Eric Schweikardt and archi
tecture professor Mark Gross, 
roBlocks are small, magnetic 
blocks with computerized circuits 
inside them that can be put to
gether to form robots.
The blocks were designed as 
part of a project for developing
Fred Gilman, the Buhl profes. sor of theoretical physics and for
mer head of the physics depart
ment, was appointed dean of the 
Mellon College of Science (MCS) 
last week. Having served as act
ing dean of the college since Sep
tember of last year, Gilman suc
ceeds Rick McCullough, the vice 
president of research at Carnegie 
Mellon.
I am very excited, looking 
ahead at the many opportuni
ties for the Mellon College of Sci
ence, Gilman said.
Divided between the main 
campus and its off-campus host, 
the Mellon Institute, MCS is comV'
computationally enhanced build
ing sets.
Were looking at ways of em
bedding computational technolo
gies into toys and construction 
kits to provide children oppor
tunities to design things, Gross 
said.
The roBlocks fit well with this 
central theme. Everybody likes 
LEGO, so [we wanted to know] 
what happens if you put tiny little 
computers into all of the LEGOs, 
Schweikardt said.
Following this idea, the team 
created an initial set of blocks by 
hand. Each block has a specific 
function and can be connected 
magnetically to other blocks. The 
way the blocks are connected de
termines the function of the robot 
that is finally formed. Children
posed of four departments: bio
logical sciences, chemistry, math
ematical sciences, and physics. 
While the main campus houses 
the mathematical sciences and 
physics departments, the biologi
cal sciences and chemistry de
partments are based in the Mel
lon Institute on Fifth Avenue.
As dean, Gilman will be re-sponsible for these four depart
ments and approximately 200 
faculty members within them.
Gilman said that he intends to 
increase connections between 
different parts of the college. 
His vision is focused on promot
ing the multidisciplinary tradi
tion of Carnegie Mellon, which,
See luhbt pageA8
can thus combine the blocks in 
multiple ways, creating a variety 
of different robots.
There are four main types of 
blocks, Schweikardt said. Sensor 
blocks connect the robot to the 
external environment. They have 
infrared sensors to sense distance, 
light sensors, sound sensors, and 
knobs which can be manipulated 
by hand to vary the amount of sig
nals received by the block.
Actuator blocks use the data 
from the input blocks and pro
duce the output. One type of ac
tuator blocks has LED bar graphs 
to display the amount of input.
However, as Schweikardt 
said, The motorized blocks are 
probably the most fun. Motor
ized blocks have treads, which 
enable the blocks to move

to build a tube-like structure 
(a bone) out of two sheets of 
letter-sized paper, newspaper, 
and six inches of Scotch tape.
The finish and strength of the 
structure is then tested by re
searchers who balance the bone 
on two parallel supporting struc
tures. They hang a container full 
of glass beads from the center 
of the bone and keep adding 
glass beads until the bone snaps.
At the end of the challenge, 
the strongest bones creators 
win a prize. This years winner 
built a record-breaking bone 
that held 24 pounds of marbles.
Phil Campbell, associate re
search professor at ICES, led the 
Build a Bone activity this year.

Bats feeding on 
insects help plants
Recent studies published in 
Science magazine show that in
sect-eating bats in tropical areas 
significantly reduce the amount 
of insects feeding on plants. The 
bats are thus extremely useful 
for farmers in such regions.
Two separate studies were 
conducted at a coffee plantation 
in Mexico and in a natural for
est in Panama to test the effects 
of bats insect consumption as 
opposed to that of birds.
The results showed that 
bats contribute in reducing the 
number of insects crawling on 
plants. *
Insect consumption by bats 
increases to a large extent in 
wet summers, when bats repro
duce most. In the dry winter 
seasons, the consumption of in
sects is mostly due to birds.

How Things Work: Military robots
JUN XIAN LEONG
Relatively unheard of a mere century 
ago, robots are becoming increasingly 
common in our military today. From the 
infamous Predator unmanned reconnais
sance aircraft to land-based amphibious 
TALON robots, more often than not robots 
are the first to enter any battlefield.
There are many advantages to robots as 
compared to human soldiers  the most 
important one being their capability to 
perform missions remotely in the field, 
without any actual danger to human lives.
Robots are generally sturdier and more 
capable of withstanding damage than 
humans, hence giving them a higher 
chance of success in dangerous environ
ments  and whenever a robot is shot 
down, the military simply rolls out a new 
one. Interestingly, the first unmanned 
aerial-assault vehicles appeared as early 
as 1849, in the form of unmanned attack 
balloons loaded with explosives to launch 
towards the enemy.
Following the invention of remote con
trol by Nikolai Tesla in 1898, the earliest 
battlefield robots appeared in the 1940s
in the form of the German Goliath, an 
expendable minesweeper robot, which ran 
on wired remote control.
By the 1960s, unmanned aircraft were 
already scanning enemy movements and 
deploying weaponry behind enemy lines; 
however, their applications were still rath
er limited due to political reasons.
In 2003, the U.S. deployed the Predator 
robot aircraft with great success in the 
wars against Iraq and Afghanistan.
The Predator is essentially a remotecontrolled aircraft with an on-board cam
era, and in certain cases is outfitted with 
weaponry such as Hellfire missiles. This 
allows it to not only be used for reconnais
sance, but also assassination missions in 
areas deep within enemy territory  both 
of which were crucial in turning the tide in 
Afghanistan.
Although we are perhaps most familiar 
with the Terminator as being the generic 
land-based killer robot of the future, there 
is actually no particular reason for military 
robots to assume a humanoid form. In 
fact, the unwieldy and fragile human form 
pales in comparison to the military robots 
of today.
Robots designed for military applica* \  '  3gnr
tions typically have several major require
ments. Among these, the robots must be 
robust enough to withstand enemy fire, 
usually require a low profile to avoid being 
targeted, and must be capable of navigat
ing obstacles on the battlefield efficiently.
As such, current land-based military 
robots are generally ground-hugging 
treaded vehicles, with innovations such 
as treaded flippers to keep themselves 
upright and advanced navigation systems 
to traverse rugged terrain. These military 
robots are currently used as battlefield 
reconnaissance; for instance, the PackBot 
is, like its namesake, designed to be carried 
in a backpack.
The PackBot can be deployed nearly 
anywhere  soldiers simply toss it out the 
window and set yp the controls, allowing 
them to monitor dangerous areas remote
ly. Other robots are used as backup for 
soldiers by carrying ammunition, equip
ment, refreshments, and other essentials 
for personnel on the battlefield.
Currently, TALON robots are also 
being tested with several different out
fitted weapons, including machine guns, 
rifles, antitank weapons, and grenade 
launchers.
Larger military robots play an impor
tant role in tasks that would be too haz
ardous for humans to attempt, such as 
minesweeping and explosives detonation. 
Other uses of these robots include evacu
ation of wounded soldiers from fire zones, 
firefighting, and decontamination of war 
zones.
At the moment, robots are still gener
ally incapable of autonomous operation. 
Software advances in threat recognition 
are still nowhere near reliable on a battle
field  for instance, a robot might not 
shoot enemy soldiers hiding behind a cow, 
but fire at a poster of a rifle.
Despite these practical concerns, there is 
little worry that advances in military robots 
are heralding the age of the Terminator. 
The majority of military robots do not con
tain much artificial intelligence at all, but 
are instead wholly remote-controlled.
As such, the chances of any of these 
robots going out of control and harming 
human lives is slim to none. However, the 
capability of robots to perform missions 
without endangering human lives is their 
greatest advantage and the main reason 
why military robots are here to stay.

Health Talk: Hiccups
SARAH MOGIN
Chugging cold water, swal
lowing straight honey, holding 
your breath  when it comes 
to hiccups, desperate times call 
for desperate measures. Though 
hiccups are generally thought of 
as comical, harmless afflictions, 
cases can vary dramatically in 
severity and duration.
Hiccups occur in patients of 
all races and health conditions, 
though they are slightly more 
common in males thaft females. 
Younger people get the hiccups 
more often than older ones  
unborn babies even hiccup in 
the womb.
Hiccups are caused by a spasm 
contracting the diaphragm, a 
muscle essential in human res
piration.
The diaphragm is a sheet of 
muscle between the bodys chest 
cavity and the abdominal cavity. 
Under normal circumstances, 
the diaphragm contracts to en
large the chest cavity, drawing 
air into the lungs like a vacuum. 
When the muscle relaxes, air is 
pushed out of the lungs and the 
body exhales.
However, when the dia
phragm contracts in a spasm, 
the body begins to inhale but is 
interrupted by an abrupt closing 
of the glottis, the space between 
the vocal cords. This sudden 
closure causes the classic hie 
sound that gives hiccups their 
name.
A spasm in the diaphragm can
be caused by something as com
mon as a flill stomach, the result 
of eating too quickly, drinking 
excessive amounts of alcohol, or 
swallowing air.
Hiccups brought on by a full 
stomach are usually mild and 
can go away without any treat
ment within several minutes or 
hours.
Yet, some cases of hiccups are 
significantly more enduring. 
Doctors call hiccups that last 
beyond 48 hours persistent hic
cups, and hiccups that last for a 
month or more are called intrac
table hiccups.
Intractable hiccups are rare 
and reflect more severe symp
toms, like weight loss and ex
haustion. Both persistent and 
intractable hiccups are usually 
indicators of other health prob
lems, often more serious than a 
full stomach.
These underlying issues range 
from mental health problems to 
metabolic disorders to nerve ir
ritation in the head, neck, and 
chest. Additionally, problems 
in the central nervous system, 
including cancer, stroke, injury, 
and infection,, can lead to hic
cups.
Though most mild cases of 
hiccups will stop on their own, 
there are plenty of home reme
dies available for impatient suf
ferers. Tricks like pulling your 
tongue, biting a lemon, or drink
ing from the far side of the glass 
are good for stopping hiccups 
within the first few minutes.
These methods target the nasopharynx, a piece of the phar
ynx that connects to the nasal 
passage.
Some other hiccup remedies 
work by disrupting the respira
tory cycle; these include holding 
your breath, drinking cold water 
quickly, or even getting scared.
When home remedies like 
these are unable to quell hic
cups, mild treatments like acu
puncture and hypnosis can of
ten do the trick.
Still, more severe cases may 
require the help of a medical 
professional, whose methods 
can include massaging the back 
of the neck or the carotid sinus 
artery (also in the neck), or 
even pressing on the eyebalL;
indirectly, these methods affect 
nerves in the diaphragm.
Similarly, doctors may recom
mend diaphragm-relaxing med
ication for patients suffering 
from persistent or intractable 
hiccups. For especially stubborn 
hiccups, doctors may pursue 
more drastic treatments, such 
as a surgical procedure to isolate 
the nerves of the diaphragm.
Alternatively, doctors can 
target the pharynx by inserting 
a tube in the nose or mouth, in 
addition to draining the stom
ach by using a tube in the nose. 
Some doctors even recommend 
a rectal massage, a seemingly 
backwards way of relaxing the 
nerves around the glottis.
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
Though there are a seemingly 
endless amount of home and me
dicinal treatments for hiccups, 
some especially elusive cases 
can go on for years or even de
cades. The longest-lasting case 
of hiccups was Charles Osborne, 
a man from Iowa who hiccupped 
for 68 years straight.
Now an entry in the Guin
ness World Records, Osborne did 
not let his constant hiccupping 
hold him back; he appeared on 
numerous television programs, 
including The Tonight Show, and 
even married twice.
Whether they last for minutes 
or months, hiccups remain an 
elusive and comical nuisance to 
practically everyone.

according to Gilman, is one of 
the greatest characteristics of the 
university.
A specialist in high-energy 
physics and the former chair of 
the High Energy Physics Advi
sory Panel, Gilman earned his 
undergraduate degree in physics 
from Michigan State University in 
1962. Upon completing his Ph.D. 
at Princeton University under the 
supervision of Marvin Goldberger, 
a Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy alumnus, Gilman completed 
his post-doctoral fellowship at 
the California Institute of Tech
nology. After spending 23 years 
at the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center at Stanford University, 
Gilman joined Carnegie Mellon as 
a professor in 1995. Gilmans ac
complishments include applying 
high-energy physics to the study 
of biology and astronomy. Highenergy physics refers to the study 
of particles physical properties 
and understanding the funda
mental building blocks of nature 
in terms of electrical forces.
According to a Carnegie Mel
lon press release, the High Energy 
Physics Advisory Panel counsels 
the Department of Energy and 
National Science Foundation on 
nationwide high-energy physics 
activities and research.
The key lies in emphasizing 
areas of comparative advantage 
 what we can do better than ev
erybody else, Gilman said.
Gilman said that he believes 
in looking for and uniting the 
strengths of each of the different 
scientific fields.
Veering into directions that 
are exciting scientifically, while 
exploring the probability of do
ing something that pulls together 
different areas of study, is where 
Carnegie Mellon can make a big 
impact, he said.
Gilman acknowledges that he 
owes much of the success of MCS 
to its accomplished faculty mem
bers and graduate students. The 
multidisciplinary research at 
Carnegie Mellon works bottomup; instead of the top [people] 
instructing faculty and gradu
ate students on what to do, its 
the faculty and students who are 
making things happen, Gilman 
said.
MCS facilitates several inter
disciplinary research centers, 
such as the Art Conservation 
Research Center, the Pittsburgh 
NMR Center for Biomedical Re
search, the Molecular Biosensor 
and Imaging Center, and the 
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Cen
ter.
Professor Gilman has led the 
physics department through a 
period of outstanding growth. 
During his time as department 
head, he has launched very suc
cessful initiatives in two very di
verse areas of physics; biophysics 
and astrophysics, said physics 
professor Stephen Garoff. The 
fact that he has led both efforts 
speaks to the breadth of his view 
of science and his skill in bring
ing people together to work to
ward common goals, he added.

Magnetic blocks promote lateral thought
frnaricCy fromA7
experimenting at this point.
Were building as many blocks 
as we can to try and build bigger 
robots, Schweikardt said. Bfocks 
that are still in the pipeline in
clude actuator blocks with hinges 
and blocks with rotators.
The blocks are mainly designed 
to be an educational tool for chil
dren in the age group of 8 to 12 
years. Schweikardt said that chil
dren who were around 8 years 
old could start playing with the 
blocks and make simple robots 
with them. Older children would 
start understanding how the 
blocks worked together to form 
the entire robot.
The simple logic behind the 
functions of the robot should help 
the children enhance their lateral 
thinking skills.
According to a Carnegie Mel
lon press release, the blocks can 
also be reprogrammed to perform 
slightly different tasks from what 
they were originally designed 
to do. For example, the five logic 
blocks known as and, or, not,
nand, and xor, enable children 
to improve how their robots react 
to different stimuli. The names 
of the blocks are based on logic 
gates that carry out logical opera
tions on inputs and form a unique 
logic output. These logic gates are 
usually an integral part of digital 
circuits.
While th blocks are valuable 
educational tools, they serve a 
higher purpose as well.
People have a hard time think
ing about complex problems, 
Schweikardt said. The problems 
are more complex, meaning that 
there are a lot more individual 
actors or players, all obeying dif
ferent rules. You dont know what 
sort of change [in one part] will 
affect everything else.
These complex problems can 
be solved by examining patterns 
in the roBlocks. Unlike contem
porary robots in which a single 
brain controls the entire ro
bot, robots formed with roBlocks 
are made up of individual parts 
that'have different functions, yet 
work in unison to form the entire 
model.
This [complex robot made of 
smaller blocks] is like a model sys
tem where each little robot is its 
own actor. This is like taking six 
or eight or 12 or hundreds of little 
brains and putting them all to
gether and seeing what happens, 
Schweikardt said. By studying 
such a model, people can under
stand how different elements of a 
system can work together to per
form work efficiently and reduce 
problems.
Schweikardt and Gross hold 
high expectations for the blocks. 
We expect people to really like 
them and want them and we 
might even go to mass market
ing, Gross said.
Initially, the group wants to 
popularize the blocks through mu
seums and science centers. Were 
working with a company that will 
bring these blocks out first for use 
in museum settings, after-school 
settings, and informal learning 
settings, Gross said.
As stated in the Carnegie Mel
lon press release, Schweikardt and 
Gross expect to have the blocks in 
the market by December 2008.

The mighty cadhering.HD.HSp
SHEILA PRAKASH
Cells are interesting. There 
are hundreds of cell types, in
cluding cardiac cells, epithelial 
cells, red blood cells, and neural 
cells. Cells of a particular kind 
tend to grow together. Cardiac 
precursor cells proliferate into 
the heart. Neural crest cells in 
the spinal cord give rise to the 
neurons and cerebral cortex. 
Muscle fibers are formed by the 
fusion of myoblast cells.
On the inside, cells get more 
interesting.
Cells communicate with each 
other. Sometimes they direct 
the development of their neigh
bors by releasing signals that 
trigger cell-signaling pathways 
in recipient cells. Cells have an 
active architecture. They are 
held up by a vaulted scaffold
ing called the cytoskeleton, and 
are home to mine carts (dynein 
and kinesin) that travel up and 
down the cell using a network of 
rails, called the microtubules.
Cells engulf and destroy 
harmful cells (macrophages), 
produce antibodies (B-cells), 
and direct the regulation and 
expression of their own ge
nomes.
This work of cells is quite a 
remarkable feat. If enough cells 
are put together, they can build 
a highly developed, multicellular organism that eats, thinks, 
and breathes. But without a 
means to hold them together, 
their work is futile, and a per
son would dissociate into a pool 
of cells before even being born.
The job of holding this net
work of trillions of cells to
gether is left to the cadherin 
molecules. Cadherins can be. 
thought of as the strings of a 
marionette puppet. Without 
them, the arms and legs of a 
human being would fall to the 
floor.
, The cadherin molecule is a 
single protein chain that ex
tends from the surface of one 
cell and attaches to the cad
herin molecule on nearby cell.
Cadherin molecules are spe
cific, allowing cardiac cells to 
stick to cardiac cells, and mus
cle cells to stick to muscle cells. 
For this reason, there are many 
subclasses of cadherins. E-, N-, 
and P-cadherins are found in 
epidermal, neural, and placen
tal cells, respectively.
The activity of cadherins is 
evident very early in develop
ment.
A mutation in the mouse ' 
E-cadherin gene results in a 
mouse embryo that completely 
dissociates at the morula stage 
(when the baby mouse is merely 
an amalgamation of 16 to 32 
cells). Injecting extra N-cadherin into a two-cell frog em
bryo results in abnormal tissue 
formation. The tissues of the 
frog embryo clump, fuse, and 
thicken in abnormal places, 
revealing that cadherin is not 
only required, but required in 
specific amounts.
Cadherins can be thought 
of as the strings of a 
marionette puppet.
This brings us to an impor
tant historical puzzle about 
cadherins, recently expounded 
upon (and resolved) in the 
February 2008 issue of Science 
magazine. If the function of 
cadherins is so important to an 
organisms development, it is 
perplexing that cadherin genes 
are absent from all microor
ganisms and almost all single
celled organisms.
Let us take a step backwards 
to see what this means. Metazoans are members of the animal 
kingdom. They are always multicellular. Metazoans include 
tigers, jellyfish, elephants, and 
chickadees. Nonmetazoan mul
ticellular organisms are micro
organisms that are not animals. 
These would include plants, 
fungi, and algae. Nonmetazoan 
multicellular organisms also
include microscopic organisms 
like E. coli, amoeboids, and the 
ocean-dwelling crenarchaeota.
The widely held theory of evo
lution implies that multicellular 
organisms, like metazoans, 
evolved from the joining and 
recombining of single-celled 
ancestors, like nonmetazoans. 
But for this to happen, cells 
must first stick together. Stick
ing together involves adhesion 
molecules, like cadherin.
But in our unicellular ances
tors, cadherins are strangely 
missing.
In their article, University of 
California at Berkeley research
ers Monika Abedin and Nicole 
King took this issue to task. 
They sequenced the genome 
of a choanoflagellate (a single
celled organism with a flagella, 
or whip-like propeller) called 
Monosiga brevicollis and com
pared the number of cadherin 
genes in the microorganism 
with the number of cadherin 
genes in four metazoans  
the sea anemone, the fruit fly, 
the sea squirt, and the house 
mouse.
The numbers are similar: 23 
cadherins per genome for M. 
brevicollis, compared to 46, 17,
32, and 127 for the sea anem
one, the fruit fly, the sea squirt, 
and the house mouse.
This is a remarkable piece of 
news. It is also strange, because 
choanoflagelletes are typically 
unicellular and do not form 
cell-to-cell contacts.
This finding also humbly sug
gests that M. brevicollis could 
be the unicellular ancestor to 
animals and our closest living 
microscopic relatives. And it 
all begins and endswith cad
herins.
The cadherin molecule keeps 
multicellular organisms from 
disintegrating. But it is also an 
important molecule for study
ing animal evolution.
Cadherins are also mediators 
of cancer  when cadherins 
fail, cells slip off a tumor and 
metastasize, spreading the can
cer throughout the body.

Itkowitz and Godbole will bring positive 
change to campusCUSS OF
from the minute they step into office. 
This plan must not include vague or in
definite promises, but rather, must pro
vide a step-by-step plan to tackle the is
sues that come up throughout the year.
According to these tenets, I believe 
that the candidates best suited for the 
job of SBP and SBVP are junior business 
major Jared Itkowitz and sophomore 
business major Pooja Godbole. Their 
point-based platform, CMUnity (found 
at www.jaredandpooja.com), details 
specific information as to how they are 
going to attempt to improve students 
lives, promoting a confidence in voters 
that they know how to get the job done.
Ive had the pleasure of working with 
both Jared and Pooja on committees 
such as the Student Government Execu
tive Board, Student Government Visibil
ity Committee (which Jared and I co
chaired), Mayur Executive Board, and 
Bhangra in the Burgh Executive Board, 
and have full confidence that they are 
equipped with the tools  and more 
importantly, the passion, patience, and 
mature sense of judgment  necessary 
to succeed in these roles. If you want to 
help shape your future, then take a few 
minutes to read Jared and Poojas plat
form, as well as that of their opponents, 
Dorian Adeyami and Alex Short (www. 
tartanpride.com), to learn about the 
candidates and make an informed deci
sion on a matter that will definitely af
fect your future at Carnegie Mellon.
Student government executive elec
tions started at 6 p.m. Sunday and con
tinue through Tuesday, April 8 at 6 p.m. 
Cast your vote at stugov.andrew.cmu. 
edu/elections. For those of you who 
have not yet voted, I ask that you please 
consider my endorsement of Jared It
kowitz and Pooja Godbole for SBP and 
SBVP when you do so.
After spending nearly seven months 
in office as your current student body 
vice-president, I can offer a unique per
spective regarding the characteristics 
necessary to succeed in the roles of stu
dent body president (SBP) and student 
body vice-president (SBVP). As such, I 
am endorsing Jared Itkowitz and Pooja 
Godbole for SBP and SBVP.
Student government can  and does
 have a powerful impact on Carnegie 
Mellons student body. For example, 
whether or not you were invested in last 
years elections for SBP and SBVP, Sean 
Weinstock and my time in office has led 
to positive changes on campus. There 
are now more power plugs in the library, 
a more effectively implemented Cam
pus Rec program, and computers on the 
first floor of Hunt Library that feature 
Microsoft Word. Student body leaders 
impacts can be felt past just their times 
in office, too  next year, student orga
nization leaders will be able to utilize 
our Institutional Memory tool in order 
to save important information and data 
that will help future leaders of the orga
nization. Elected officials make changes 
that impact students everyday lives, 
and so its important to choose the right 
candidates for the student body.
Sean and I agree that our five point 
platform, along with other government 
bodies hard work this year, has brought 
our student government to what Jared 
Itkowitz, Student Senate chair and SBP 
candidate, calls a tipping point. But 
where do we go from here? How do we 
ensure that we dont regress upon all of 
the progress that has been made?
In order to ensure this progression, 
the student body needs to elect an SBP 
and SBVP with a strong history of effec
tive leadership and initiating positive 
change. We need to elect individuals 
that have a clear and distinct plan that 
highlight what they will do to unify and 
better the lives of their constituents
Lizzee Solomon/Art EditorClass of 2011 disadvantaged by room draw
This years room draw process left 
an unprecedented number of current 
first-years homeless, placing countless 
students on not-very-promising waiting 
lists while pushing others toward lastminute, off-campus housing.
Housing, or the lack thereof, has been 
a persistent problem on campus for sev
eral years  in the past, Carnegie Mellon 
has had to stoop so low as to house stu
dents in rooms at the Wyndham Hotel in 
Oakland or bunk them in dorm lounges
 but this year is worse than most.
Adding fuel to the fire was the fact 
that Boss, Scobell, and Mudge Houses 
are in the process of being converted 
into all first-year housing  and that 
Housing and Dining Services refuses to 
come clean on whether or not it has can
celed its contract with Cathedral Man
sions, which houses 147 Carnegie Mel
lon students each year. As the last group 
to select residences for room draw, the 
rising sophomore class was hit the hard
est. While Housing has said that it will
assign residences to all students cur
rently on the waitlist by June 1, it is un
fair to shift the burden of navigating this 
obviously flawed system to the group of 
students who is the least familiar with 
the room draw process.
In addition, there were technical 
problems with the program that shows 
students which residences are still 
available online; several students com
plained of the program showing either 
falsely available or falsely unavailable 
housing options. The system was even
tually taken down, but the unpredict
ability of the room draw process added 
to students unrest. \
Furthermore, judging by this years 
botched room draw, Housing has failed 
to acknowledge how a living situation 
can affect a students emotional well
being and academic success.
If students dont feel comfortable 
in their living environment, and dont 
want to spend time there, they will be 
less happy overall than students who
are content with their living situations. 
In addition, students who feel they dont 
have a decent environment in which to 
do their schoolwork likely spend less 
time on homework and have to work 
in places that leave them more prone 
to distraction, such as the library or 
the UC. By forcing more students into 
less-than-ideal living arrangements, 
Housing is increasing the likelihood 
that more students will experience emo
tional stress because of where they live.
As students, we know how hard it is 
to negotiate finding a place to live and 
other students to live with. Having to 
change where and with whom one is liv
ing, or being forced to accept a place on 
the waitlist and continue to be unsure 
about where one will end up, puts ad
ditional stress on already Stressed-out 
students that could have been prevented 
far in advance had Housing notified 
students of the situation sooner, allow
ing them more time to make alternate 
arrangements.
Adi Jain, CIT2008 
Student Body Vice-President
Look past Obamas rhetoric of change
Two weeks ago, as presidential can
didate hopeful Barack Obama visited 
Pittsburgh, the word seemingly at the 
tip of Obama supporters tongues was 
change. As he spoke at Soldiers and 
Sailors Memorial Hall, kicking off his 
Road to Change tour, Obama said,
The only way change is going to hap
pen is if we change how business is 
done in Washington. Its not enough 
just to change political parties in the 
White House, weve gotta change how 
business is done. While this language 
sounds promising, his speech was sorely 
lacking on specific plans to promote 
such change. Obamas supporters dont 
seem to actually know what would be 
changed were he elected president.
The word change alone means noth
ing until backed by policies that will 
truly institute change. Here, Obama is 
lacking. His eloquent but empty calls 
for change are persuasive and inspir
ing, but I implore his supporters to look 
beyond his rhetoric.
The only thing worse than hearing the 
word change a superfluous amount of 
times in Obamas speeches is his ability 
to skirt around actual issues. Obamas 
argument that there are no Democratic 
or Republican solutions  just Ameri
can ones  is, stripped down, a great 
way to say nothing. When one looks 
beyond the fact that he is skilled orator,
Obamas presidential platform becomes 
a lot less impressive.
Take health care. Like he insists presi
dential platforms should be, Obamas 
plan is neither Democratic nor Republi
can; it is best characterized as unlikely Tarun Bhan, H&SS 2009
to work. He wants the government tbhan@andrew
to help, but not force, citizens to buy 
health care coverage. That means that 
a healthy person could theoretically 
avoid paying into the system until be
coming sick, then buy in and use the re
sources of other citizens who have been 
contributing all along to subsidize their 
medical care. Obamas health care plan 
is a setup for failure. Is this the kind of 
change our country needs?
It takes more than a persuasive rhet
oric to be president. My question to 
Obama supporters is, What qualifies Ba
rack Obama to be commander-in-chief? 
Is it his two years in the Senate? Or is it 
the seven years he spent in the political 
hotbed of the Illinois State Senate?
A candidate must have accomplished 
something before getting my vote for 
president. Barack Obama has not ac
complished anything substantial in the 
Senate, has not sponsored a major piece 
of legislation, and has no executive ex
perience. This is a problem, considering 
that hes running 'for the office of the 
chief executive of our country. Experi
ence is needed before assuming this 
role, as the office of the president is not 
somewhere to be learning on the job, but 
rather, to be employing already-learned 
knowledge. I fear that the former is ex
actly what Obama would be doing.
When Obama speaks, its easy to see 
why people like him. He is a skilled ora
tor, and he has written two New York 
Times bestsellers. When he speaks, we 
listen. However, Im just not sure were 
hearing anything worth listening to.
Student government elections: Cut the idealism
This years contest for student body 
president (SBP) has yielded two tickets 
taking nearly opposite approaches, but 
these candidates do have one thing in 
common: banking on either too many or 
too few initiatives, both suffer from per
ilously idealistic campaigns.
Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole 
(CMUnity) have signs that simply read 
A Plan. Theyve stuck with the num
bers theme from Sean Weinstock and 
Adi Jains CMU 5, but have upgraded 
their platform to seven planks, under 
which there is a detailed list of 28 first 
steps. This alone merits a point of cau
tion. The seven separate initiatives are 
substantive enough that they each merit 
a task force of dedicated students and, 
even then, the goals they list would be 
difficult to realize in a single year.
Of course the candidates dont want 
to limit themselves, but to have such a 
comprehensive plan as a jumping off
point is a little too adventurous. The duo 
has proven that theyre hard workers 
and excellent planners, but if they hope 
to get work done on all points of their 
platform, theyll have to sacrifice depth 
for breadth, if only because there are not 
enough hours in the day. They should 
look to Sean Weinstock, who only ac
complished some of his five goals, but 
has still been successful as SBP.
CMUnitys opponents, Dorian Adeyemi and Alex Short, suffer from the 
opposite affliction. Their biggest initia
tive is to leave the initiatives to students. 
They hope that through e-mail, forums, 
and other types of exposure, students 
will bring ideas to them. But this cam
pus is known for its apathy. Asking the 
student body to come up with ideas 
doesnt make as much sense as giving 
them clear opportunities to participate 
in Carnegie Mellon student life.
The boldface reality is that very few
of Carnegie Mellons too-busy students 
are going to bring forth initiatives dur
ing the year. The lack of a structured 
plan will end in stagnation, not because 
the candidates are unqualified for the 
job, but because theyll either be over
whelmed with unplanned initiatives to 
take on, or more likely, underwhelmed 
and unsure where to expend their ener
gies. The whole reason we want an SBP 
and SBVP is that regular students dont 
know how things workwe dont know 
which of our suggestions are realistic or 
feasible.
It is common knowledge that student 
body presidents, like real presidents, 
generally do not follow through with 
all of their campaign promises. Still, 
platforms (and past experiences) are 
the only indicators we have of what our 
leaders want to devote themselves to, 
so it is important that they be realistic 
about what is possible.
College is hard (er) to get into
On April 1, millions of high school 
seniors received rejection letter upon 
ejection letter from the nations top 
:olleges, and it was not an April Fools 
oke. The incoming class of 2012' was a 
/ictim of the lowest college acceptance 
rates the nation has ever seen, according 
:o The New York Times. Harvard led the 
Dack with a record-low acceptance rate 
7.1 percent, followed close behind by
Yale and Columbia at 8.3 and 8.9 per
cent, respectively.
Admissions requirements and class 
sizes have not changed dramatically
 but application numbers have risen, 
making incoming college students the 
cause of their own heightened numbers 
of rejections.
In 2006, the National Association for 
College Admission Counseling reported
many seniors having applied to at least 
11 colleges, with over 32 percent apply
ing to at least seven.
Our message for incoming college 
students is this: Relax a little. Reach 
high, but be realistic. Dont apply for the 
sake of applying, and maybe acceptance 
rates will go back to being higher than 
the number of colleges to which you 
apply.

City-county merger
PMhblfus oueufC
Last Friday, Pittsburghs news
papers screamed Mayor Luke 
Ravenstahls announcement that 
he is willing to work with Al
legheny County executive Dan 
Onorato to push a public referen
dum on whether or not to merge 
the city of Pittsburgh with Al
legheny County.
Rust-belt cities (northeastern 
cities that have experienced 
economic downturn following 
a loss of industry) are shrinking 
rapidly in their urban cores, and 
with tax bases quickly drying 
up, redevelopment is difficult. 
Urban planners are staring long
ingly at the rich tax base of the 
still-growing suburbs that ben
efit from their proximity to the 
dying citys infrastructure.
A city-county merger model 
is the mid-90s merger of Louis
ville, Ky. with the surrounding 
Jefferson County. Government 
functions and services were 
consolidated under one govern
ment, but individual municipali
ties (other than Louisville in Jef
ferson County) were allowed to 
retain some autonomy.
The big question is whether 
Pittsburgh would benefit from a 
merger. It seems intuitively clear 
that Pittsburgh, which will gain 
status as it gains population, will 
benefit greatly. It will have more 
money from suburban tax reve
nue to invest in public schooling, 
develop new industries, stream
line city-county services, and 
update infrastructure.
One glaring problem is that 
the city will grow from 300,000 
largely-minority residents to a 
largely-Caucasian city of over 
one million. If districts stay the 
way they are, minority neighbor
hoods will hemorrhage political 
power and thousands will be un
able to effect change.
There are plans to redraw dis
tricts in order to maintain minor
ity power, but as this citys sub
urban ring is more conservative 
than its liberal urban core, its 
unclear if a merged city would 
remain the Democratic strong
hold that it has long been.
The burst of growth from a 
merger could make the city at
tractive to outside investment, 
especially with Pittsburghs pre
existing universities, hospitals, 
and cultural institutions. Still, 
the city is in disrepair; infrastruc
ture is failing and city services 
are being cut. Most of the added 
revenue from the merger would 
need to be spent on maintenance 
and repair before being allocated 
toward redevelopment.
A merger has the potential to 
put Pittsburgh back on the map, 
but if it isnt sensitive to the reali
ties of an aging Pittsburgh  ra
cial politics, decaying infrastruc
ture, autonomous suburbs  it 
may do more damage than good.

Magic synthesizes Mexican culture
quhequf erTcr
Those who travel to Mexico 
looking for sandy beaches and 
bright sunshine might be a little 
surprised to learn what else can 
be found in some of the smaller 
of the countrys towns  a thriv
ing population of witches and 
warlocks, for example.
The New York Times published 
an article on March 28 about 
the Mexican town of Catemaco, 
a known center of witchcraft 
in the country. The article de
scribes the work of several sup
posed witches and warlocks, 
such as Alejandro Gallegos 
Garca, a self-proclaimed war
lock working in both black (evil) 
and white (good) magic. Some of 
his skills as a warlock seem a bit 
outlandish  he claims to know 
how to kill a person with a black 
cloth doll, a human bone, a toad, 
and, of course, the permission of 
the devil.
However, past the ability to 
proclaim death upon another 
person, magicians such as Gal
legos play an important cultural 
role in the region. Natives and 
tourists alike approach them 
for such purposes as healing 
from physical ailments, issues 
in love or friendship, and spiri
tual cleansing. The witch doctors 
also offer alternative remedies, 
such as herbal mixtures, in place 
of more traditional solutions to
sickness.
Although I try not to judge, 
Im quite skeptical about some of 
the skills the so-called warlocks 
boast. The idea that one of these 
witch doctors can ask the devils 
permission to kill someone, and 
then carry that act out through 
the use of a frog, a doll, and a 
bone, seems far-fetched. I under
stand that such magic is indeed 
a part of Mexicos heritage (ac
cording to the article, it has been 
around since' pre-Columbian 
times). But is claiming to know 
the formula for murder the best 
way to represent ones cultural 
history?
In addition, the witch doctors 
can be pretty tricky and cunning. 
The article mentions that they 
are known to tell users they have 
a hex on them, and then offer to 
remove it... for a fee, of course. 
Gullible tourists, for example, 
can easily be caught up in this 
foreign, magical scene.
Tourists, however, are not the 
only people interested in the 
magic. Mexican magic combines 
elements of Catholicism and preColumbian traditions, therefore 
drawing many Mexican follow
ers, as it can give them some-i 
thing to connect to. Many turn to 
magic as a way to solve problems 
in their lives outside of organized 
religion.
The idea that herbs and roots 
can have healing properties 
is, I agree, a plausible aspect of 
Mexican magical practices  far 
more so than eradicating evil spir
its or providing spiritual cleans
ing. While I dont think Ill be 
skipping a visit to the doctors 
office to dig up some plants in 
Schenley Park the next time I 
come down with a cold, people 
have been using herbs as a way 
to combat sickness since long 
before modern medicine. The 
bark of the willow tree, for 
example, has been known for 
centuries to relieve pain, as it 
contains salicin, which, when 
converted to salicylic acid, is 
closely related to aspirin.
In addition, the placebo ef
fect should not be neglected
 if people believe in the work 
of black and white witchcraft, 
and it is part of their culture, 
then they may indeed feel bet
ter from it, even if the actions 
have no real impact.
We at Carnegie Mellon are 
not without our own cus
toms that would probably be 
deemed strange by outsid
ers. Just as most of us do not 
understand the cultural power 
of Mexican witch doctors, for
eigners to our campus might 
be baffled by such traditions as 
Buggy and painting the Fence. 
We shouldnt be too quick to 
judge, especially the cultural 
practices of others  that is, as 
long as the toad, bone, and rag 
doll stay far, far away.

Protein Structure Initiative spends misguided money on research
Cqudah ofhchCq
The process of understanding 
protein folding in cells is argu
ably one of the most well-stud
ied, yet elusive problems in biol
ogy. It stems from a fundamental 
inability to predict a proteins 
structure given an instruction 
manual (DNA) and parts (amino 
acids). Such a complicated pro
cess is leading scientists to pursue 
expensive, and sometimes fruit
less, methods of studying them.
A protein begins as a string of 
amino adds, but is useless until 
this string coils and folds into 
a particular shape. Proteins fold 
in beautiful and complex ways. 
There are untold ways a protein 
can fold, and it varies from pro
tein to protein. Knowledge of this 
intricate folding pattern would 
give researchers information 
about drug assembly processes 
and potential drug design.
For the most part, finding an 
intuitive model that predicts 
how a two-dimensional string of 
amino acids will fold into a threedimensional protein shape, given 
a particular DNA sequence, has 
remained challenging. Given the 
astronomical number of possibili
ties, it would take the age of the 
universe to sample all of them. 
Yet somehow, the protein finds its 
correct shape in microseconds.
The picture of protein folding is 
baffling. Computational models 
fail to predict protein structures 
accurately and routinely.
Still, the lack of an intuitive 
explanation has not stopped sci
entists the world over from adopt
ing costly, and sometimes contro
versial, approaches to amassing 
the worlds largest structural
database  one protein at a time. 
Four research centers are tak
ing part in the Protein Structure 
Initiative (PSI), a worldwide, 
brute-force approach to under
standing proteins that many have 
hailed as a revolution.
However, by the end of 2010, 
the project will have cost more 
than three-quarters of a billion 
dollars.
Are proteins that important? 
Yes. But we need a more cost-effective way of researching them.
Appreciating the scope of this 
problem requires a quick recap of 
elementary biology.
To begin, it is important to 
grasp the intricacy of DNA codes 
for proteins. A strand of DNA is 
made up of individual letters 
(nucleotides) represented by A, 
G, C, and T. In the cell, this string 
of letters can be thought of as a 
code that is parsed, or scanned, 
in groups of three by a scanning 
mechanism called the ribosome. 
As the DNA code is scanned, 
litde blocks called amino acids 
are sucked into the ribosome 
and then spit out the other end. 
Together, this string of ejected 
blocks forms a protein.
But there is a fly in the oint
ment. Given a particular 
sequence of DNA, its impossible 
to know which way the resulting 
protein will fold. It was origi
nally thought that the string of 
amino acid blocks was linear and 
remained that way. Differences 
among proteins were chiefly 
attributed to differences in amino 
acid sequences.
That is not the case.
Proteins fold, and they do it 
with magnificent complexity. 
Some proteins, like cadherins, 
look like Twizzlers. Others look 
like rubber band balls.
Researchers involved in the PSI
are churning out proteins at a 
furious rate. A protein that used 
to take two years to resolve now 
takes two days. Over the course 
of seven years, the PSI initiative 
has contributed roughly 40 per
cent of the structures available in 
the Protein Data Bank.
This is indeed impressive. It 
has been accomplished by using 
equipment that is elaborate and 
costly, turning itself into a glis
tening, state-of-the-art molecule 
factory. So far, its done this to 
the tune of $80 million.
But is it necessary to understand 
all of these protein structures?
As the PSI approaches the half
way mark of its second five-year 
phase, a mounting number of sci
entists are calling it a mistake, 
with some reviewers even calling 
the approach tragically flawed. 
One key problem is that the rate 
of novel protein families being 
discovered is far greater than the 
rate of protein structure produc
tion. The continual discovery of 
proteins that have never been 
seen before could make the pro
tein structure problem an openended one. Moreover, protein 
structures are of little to no use 
outside of a biochemical context.
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
The PSI is doubtless doing 
a wonderful thing for molecu

Hey Carnegie Mellon,
Elections for the next student 
body president, vice-president, 
and vice-president of finance 
are going on right now through 
tomorrow night at 6 p.m. You 
can vote and read all the plat
forms at stugov.andrew.cmu. 
edu/elections. Additionally, you 
can see pretty campaign pic
tures and cool design layouts 
(and, of course, the candidates 
platforms) at Jared Itkowitz and 
Pooja Godboles CMUnity web
site, www.jaredandpooja.com, 
or at Dorian Adeyemi and Alex 
Shorts website, www.tartanpride.com.
Now that the logistical infor
mation is over, I thought that the 
next most important thing for 
me to convey, to you this week 
was why you should vote. I will 
make a Top 10 list, although, 
as I dont have 10 points, lets just 
call it the Top list.
1. Vote or Die. Diddy and JayZ said it in the 2004 elections. 
Since they, as hip-hop moguls, 
cant be wrong, and since people 
have a general aversion to death, 
the answer is obvious: Vote!
2. You may or may not have 
already read Adis endorsement 
to the left. For personal reasons, 
I have decided not to publicly 
endorse either candidate in this 
election. Either way, Adi men
tions that, despite the fact that 
you may or may not care about 
voting or the offices of SBP and 
SBVP, the people who are elected 
into office by those that do care 
will create changes on this cam
pus that affect all of us in one 
way or another. Thats an abso
lutely true statement, so vote!
3. Those of you who are read
ing this and are enrolled as stu
dents at Carnegie Mellon are 
at least somewhat nerdy and 
strong-willed. Its simply in line 
with such characters to want to 
voice your opinion. Maintain 
your image vote!
4. Clicking buttons on web 
pages is fun. If you vote, you get 
the opportunity to do this, so 
vote!
5. Hopefully, you have opin
ions about what needs to change 
on this campus. The easiest way 
to change the things that bother 
us is to support candidates who 
also want to change those things, 
and who will work night and day 
to do so. Vote!
6. As an 18-plus-year-old, you 
just got rights... other than that 
whole going to bars thing, unless 
youre 21-plus. Regardless, use 
the ones youve got. Vote!
7. You want to read someone 
elses (not mine) articles in this 
column in The Tartan. Vote!
Basically, thats it. You should 
vote: Its important and its 
tradition (or counter-tradition
 whichever way you want to 
look at it). Your life at Carnegie 
Mellon depends on it!

SPORTS COMMENTARYThe Magic of March Madness
SHAFIQUE RASHID
With the NCAA mens basket
ball national championship set 
to be played between power
house universities Kansas and 
Memphis, it is easy to forget 
what makes March Madness 
so, well, mad. For the first time 
in the tournaments history, all 
four number-one seeds made it 
to the Final Four, with n6 Cin
derella team left to root for. But 
to say that this result, which 
would have taken negligible 
sports acumen to predict, has 
made this years tournament any 
less exciting would be overlook
ing most of what has occurred 
over the last month.
Anybody who wonders why 
college basketballs final three 
weeks are so widespread in 
popularity needed only to wit
ness the first two rounds of play 
this year. With an initial field 
of 64 teams in the tournament, 
it seemed like CBS was able 
to televise a brewing upset for 
every one of its time slots over 
the first four days, including 
Western Kentuckys improbable
buzzer beater to shock Drake 
in overtime, Duke just squeak
ing by Belmont by one point, 
and San Diego coming out of 
nowhere and taking down Con
necticut by one point in over
time. And thats just to name a 
few from the first round.
What makes March Madness 
so great ultimately boils down to 
the volume of the playing field, 
unseen in any other sporting 
competition except maybe the 
Olympics. Aside from the frenzy 
of the first four days, during 
which 48 games cut the field to 
16, there is also an unbelievable 
amount of diversity in competi
tion. You see the unknown mid 
major pitted against the storied 
program, the southern country 
school up against one from the 
inner city, the confident team 
stacked with talent against the 
tenacious overachieving one. 
The subplots within the'tourna
ment are countless, making it 
very easy to find a team to iden
tify with. And the laws of prob
ability say you will get a few up
sets to shock you along the way.
Byt when the upsets carry 
into the Sweet Sixteen and then
the Elite Eight, it is no longer a 
result of simple probability. This 
year, Davidson, which has just 
1674 total undergrads, put on 
the glass slipper and made an 
exhilarating run reminiscent 
of George Mason just two years 
ago. The relative unknown from 
North Carolina, a state already 
in over its head in basketball 
with established programs in 
UNC, N.C. State, and Wake For
est, upset number-seven seed 
Gonzaga, number-two seed 
Georgetown, and number-three 
seed Wisconsin consecutively 
to make it to the Elite Eight. All 
three of those teams have been 
annual staples for the .NCAA 
tournament. Yet the motley 
crew of Davidson, seetied just 
10th and led by the hot Stephen 
Curry, played as if it belonged 
in a major conference as well. 
There was nobody following 
the tournament who wasnt, 
unless for obvious monetary 
reasons, behind Davidson dur
ing its run. And when the team 
played number-one seed Kansas 
to the buzzer, missing a shot at 
the end of regulation that would 
have won the game, you could
almost hear the collective moan 
of a sports nation hoping to see 
the Cinderella survive one more 
week to the Final Four. But our 
hearts were beating neverthe
less.  . ,
Whether by way of disap
pointment or utmost glee, the 
NCAA tournament never fails 
to resonate with its spectators. 
The fact that the Final Four this 
year consisted solely of nUmberone seeds is a moot point. At 
this stage in the competition, 
seeding no longer has any rel
evance. The Final Four simply 
consists of those teams that 
were on the right side of all the 
shocks, all the late-game rallies 
and buzzer beaters. This year 
they were Kansas, Memphis, 
UCLA, and UNC  schools, not 
seeds. Kansas and Memphis 
were on the right side of things 
once again Saturday night. The 
NCAA tournament, much like 
the real world, is as much about 
surviving as it is excelling. 
Whichever team is left cutting 
down the nets Monday night can 
say that the players fought their 
way all the way to the top, with 
all of us as their witnesses.

quickly beat Hopkins 7-2, never 
leaving the outcome of the match 
on the table for discussion.
Our doubles came out really 
well and we played really aggres
sively, Hart said. It was a good 
win all around for everyone. We 
showed we can win against top 
teams.
The womens record is now
13-5. However, the course of the 
mens match was vastly, different 
from the that of the womens. 
Carnegie Mellon got into a deep 
hole quickly, going down 0-3 after 
losing all three doubles matches.
In singles, where the team excels, 
the men quickly evened things out 
3-3. The last three matches fell 
to MacTaggart, who lost 6-3, 6-2 
to give Hopkins the penultimate 
point with a 4-3 lead.
When MacTaggart lost, sopho
more Jon Spero and Raghavan 
were still on the court, locked in 
battle. For Carnegie Mellon to 
win, both Spero and Raghavan 
had to win.
In the first set of his match, 
Raghavan got blown off the court
by the powerful shots of his bulky 
Hopkins opponent, losing 6-0. 
Raghavan managed to get his head 
back together and started out the 
second set well, matching the 
power of his opponent. Raghavan 
whipped forehands cross-court as 
well as his opponent, and he came 
up with some up-the-line passing 
shots that curled in.
While Raghavans match was 
even in the second set, Spero had 
won the first set of his match 6-2. 
Spero went down 3-0 in the topsy-turvy second set, but managed 
to climb back, only to lose his 
serve again and go down 5-3. The 
Hopkins player had the set on his 
racquet, which proved disadvan
tageous, as he yelled: How many 
double faults are you going to give 
him? and hung his head after 
every missed first serve. Spero 
took advantage, pulling even and 
forcing a second-set tiebreaker.
In the tiebreaker, Speros emo
tional opponent came up with 
some, good serves, forcing a weak 
return from Spero that could 
be easily volleyed into the open 
court. Spero, after expending 
much energy to force the tiebreak
er, lost it 7-5. In the third set, the 
momentum had swung complete
ly to Hopkins. Speros shots got 
shorter and shorter in the court, 
allowing his opponent to pounce 
on them. Spero lost his serve to go 
down 3-1. Spero couldnt repeat 
his second-set comeback, and lost 
his match 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
We went 3-0 in doubles and 
that put a lot more pressure on 
singles, Spero said. I came out 
pretty hot. But he played better on 
the bigger points at the end of the 
second set. Theyre a very intense 
team, and that can help you or 
hurt you.
Moments after Speros loss gave 
Hopkins the win at 5-3, Raghavan 
cracked and lost 6-0, 7-5. The 
mens record is now 12-6.
The tennis teams enter the 
home stretch of their season this 
week. Today at 3:30 p.m., the men 
play Grove City College. Over the 
weekend, they will compete in the 
Great Lakes Colleges Association 
(GLCA) tournament at the College 
of Wooster in Ohio. The women 
play West Liberty State College and 
ninth-ranked Denison University 
Saturday and Sunday away.

We placed in almost every event 
and Im looking forward to the 
UAA in Chicago.
The mens and womens teams 
will return to action at home this 
Tuesday, April 8 for the Carnegie 
Mellon Tri-Meet.
Having back-to-back meets is 
definitely a challenge. But it sim
ulates our conference meet well 
since UAA is going to be a two-day 
meet, Tang said. This is when we 
really have to focus and do what

less experienced competitors.
Numerous Beta teams domi
nate the Majors league, and it is 
not a stretch to predict that one 
of them will likely come out on 
top. Since only a few games have 
been played so far, it is hard to 
determine who will stand out 
as one of the top teams at the 
end of the season; there is no 
dominating presence as all have 
exhibited the necessary skill 
level to successfully compete at 
the Majors level.
Get My Lid, a softball team 
made up of current and former 
mens basketball players, has dis
played dominance in the first few 
games. Offensively, this team is 
one of the Major leagues best 
teams.
The most unpredictable and 
entertaining league in softball 
is the Co-Rec league. In Co-Rec 
softball, male team members are 
forced to bat with their non-dominate hands. This is essentially 
supposed to even out the level of 
play, providing opportunities for 
success to those teams who make 
the fewest mistakes.
Co-Rec kickball rosters are due 
into the department by 4:30 p.m. 
this Thursday. Teams will need at 
least four men and four women 
to participate in the kickball sea
son.
The games will be played in a

The Carnegie Mellon tennis 
teams have had a busy week. On

dropped 6-3 decisions to the 
University of Mary Washington. 
On Saturday, the women bounced 
back, crushing Swarthmore 8-1. 
On Sunday, the women hand

Hopkins University, but the men 
lost a terse, closely contested 
match 6-3.
On Friday in Virginia, both 
teams took on the University of 
Mary Washington, whose mens 
and womens teams were ranked 
11th and seventh, respectively. In 
this case, the rankings were cor

teams prevailed.
For the men, first-years Bobby 
MacTaggart, 7-6 (10-8), 6-1, and
AlexNemerov, 6-4,6-1, both won, 
tight first sets and then steamrolled their opponents in the sec

on the back nine with a 33, and 
I fortunately was able to step up

Carnegie Mellons director 
of athletics, Susan Bassett, has 
appointed the new head mens 
soccer coach, Arron Lujan, 
to take over the position from 
Nick Gaudioso, who coached 
the Tartans for 27 years. Lujan 
comes from the mens program 
at Princeton University, serving 
as the teams assistant coach for 
three years.
Arron Lujan will provide excel
lent leadership for our mens soc
cer program. Arron emerged 
from a very competitive search 
process as our choice from a 
group of exceptional applicants, 
Bassett said. His credentials are 
impressive and his background is 
unique, having played on the pro
fessional level after a collegiate 
career in NCAA Division III. 
Under the leadership of Lujan, 
13 Princeton players received AllIvy honors, with four named to 
the All-Region team. Prior to his 
position with the Tigers, he was
the assistant coach the Virginia 
Wesleyan College team for two 
years, leading the program to a 
second-round appearance in the 
NCAA tournament in 2003. With 
experience at the collegiate level, 
he took coaching positions for the 
Virginia Olympic Development 
Program (ODP) and Beach FC

As the school record holder 
for the 400-meter dash, sopho
more Diane Mattingly is already 
making her mark at Carnegie 
Mellon on the womens track 
and field team. The Tartan sat 
down with Mattingly as she 
discussed her interesting start 
in running races and her chal
lenges as a scholar-athlete.
The Tartan: When did you 
first take an interest in track 
and field? Did anyone else in 
your family participate in this 
sport?
Mattingly: When I was in 
elementary school, we had 
county relays, where we used 
pieces of hose for the baton 
and jumped over haybales. I 
guess thats the first time I ran 
a race. My mom used to run 
when she was in grade school, 
and [she] competed at a state 
level.
T: Besides your own, which 
events do you like to watch at 
meets or wish that you could 
try?
M: I think everyone wants to 
try the steeplechase. [Theres] 
something about jumping into 
a water pit [that] makes a 3K 
more interesting.
T: Since track competes for 
most of the year during the 
indoor and outdoor seasons, 
do you feel it helps your time 
management? If so, how?
M: It definitely tests my time 
management. Work is not an 
excuse to miss practice, and 
staying up late doesnt help me 
perform. That means I have to 
buckle down during the week 
and focus so I have time to do 
everything I want to.

T: Do you have any pets?
M: We have two dogs and a 
cat. We used to have a bird, but 
then my dog ate it.
T: If you could transform 
into any animal, what would it 
be and why?
M: A ladybug because
they're lucky.
T: Is there a myth about life 
at Carnegie Mellon that you 
have either found to be true or 
found to be completely false?
M: You really can steal a 
chair from Baker and roll 
down the halls late at night. 
But bring friends  you go 
faster when they push you.
T: What is your favorite part 
about your major? If you had 
the chance to study another 
area, what would it be?
M: My favorite part is being 
able to do research within the 
department. If I could study 
something else it might be tak
ing a baking class or design 
class. Something completely 
opposite of engineering.
T: Where have your favorite 
meets been?
M: Id love to qualify for 
nationals one day, but meets 
like Kent State, Bucknell, and 
UAAs all offer amazing com
petition.
T: Where do you like to 
travel or hope to travel to in 
the future outside of track 
meets?
M: [Id like to] travel to the 
moon because even if I fall Ill 
land among the stars.

Intramural softball starts

This past week marked the 
beginning of the big intramural 
season for softball. Easily one of 
the favorite intramural sports 
at Carnegie Mellon, the popu
larity of softball can be attrib
uted to the nice weather and the 
relaxed level of play. In addition, 
the Co-Recreational (Co-Rec) 
league allows men and women 
to compete with one another for 
a change. Even though teams are 
still competing for the highly cov
eted IM championship shirts, peo
ple tend to have more fun merely 
playing softball, regardless of 
the prize. IM softball marks the 
beginning of Pittsburgh spring 
and the end of the semester.
Although the Womens league 
has not had its first game yet, 
it is not too early to predict a 
solid season for Team Friggin 
Awesome. The talent of Team 
Friggin Awesome cannot be over
looked; with its physical presence 
and skill, the team will surely 
challenge its opponents in the 
league.
In the Minors league, both 
Drama Queens and Theta Xi 
look like the early favorites. The 
only team to defeat the Drama 
Queens last year, Ace and 
All Stars, has moved up to the 
Majors. Therefore, this year the 
Drama Queens should be able 
to make their way back into the 
playoffs without much difficul
ty. However, the other standout 
Minors league team, Theta Xi, 
poses a threat. With a roster that 
includes several Carnegie Mellon 
club baseball players, Theta Xi 
has the talent and athleticism to 
face off against the best teams. 
The team is quick and its players 
know how to place the ball strate
gically; these characteristics will 
give them an advantage against

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
lacrosse team played its final 
home game at Gesling Stadium 
on Saturday against Ferris State 
University (Big Rapids, Mich.). 
The Tartans played tough but 
were unable to come away with a 
win against the Bulldogs. After a 
grueling 60 minutes of play, Car
negie Mellon left the field with a 
12-7 loss.
Ferris had some strong shoot
ers on the team, and defensively 
the Tartans struggled with out
side shots. Ferris vris also an ex
tremely physical team, as shown 
by the high number of penalties 
acquired during the game. The 
Tartans attempted to capital
ize on those penalties, but were 
largely unable to do so.
The Tartans have a limited 
number of players this year, 
with only 14 on the roster, which 
has made it difficult to com
pete against squads of 35 or 40 
players. However, this has not 
stopped them from playing hard 
on the field.
Sophomore goalkeeper Na
dir Sidi is extremely proud of 
his team. The biggest strength 
on our team right nov^j is our te
nacity, he said. Our guys run 
the whole game and never quit 
fighting for the ball, and thats a 
strength we are truly proud of.
The biggest challenge for Car
negie Mellon now is to finish the 
season with a win next weekend 
against the Taylor University Tro
jans in Upland, Ind. The Tartans 
are not only a small team but also 
a young one that has high hopes 
of improving as players settle 
into their positions.
While the Tartans are now fo
cused on next weekend's match 
up against the Trojans, they are

Maggies Mercantile Everything you need to know
New restaurant offers vegan options on South Craig 0n opportunities galore and unwanted pregnancy
Craig Street's newest addition comes in the 
form of a unique eatery that fills a gap in the 
streets already diverse offerings. Maggies 
Mercantile, an organic, vegan, and raw food 
restaurant, moved into 300 South Craig St. 
adjacent to Quiznos in early March, and despite 
some initial setbacks, Maggies is seeing its fan 
base grow.
The original Maggies Mercantile is an hour 
and a half outside the city in Stahlstown, Pa., 
where all of the food for the Oakland location is 
prepared and shipped to the city daily. Maggie 
Raphael, who owns and operates the two 
eateries, also owns a farm 50 miles outside the 
city in Greensburg, which provides some of the 
organic produce for her restaurants.
Maggies serves organic, vegan, and raw 
entrees and sides, offering both hot and cold 
options. Among the hot options, favorites 
include wraps, spinach pies, and "buffalo 
chicken-style tofu. Cold offerings include 
microgreens, Waldorf salad, various pasta and 
grain salads, fresh fruits and vegetables, and 
uncooked breads. Maggies also has a decent 
selection of coconut milk smoothies, juices, and 
vegan ice creams.
Because Maggies uses predominantly seasonal 
organic produce, the menu changes frequently. 
According to manager Mike Miller, offerings 
change once or twice a week depending on 
what produce the cpoks in Stahlstown have. 
access to.
The food is served by weight in a buffet style, 
very much in the same way you might buy 
from the hot and cold bars at Whole Foods or 
Evgefstos!, Carnegie Mellons vegetarian and 
vegan option. The dining room is classy and 
refined  something like a cross between
Dozen's new bake shop in Lawrenceville and 
Entropy+. The plates are made from recycled 
plastic, and straws and cups, like some others
at Carnegie Mellon, are corn-based and 
compostable.
In addition to meals, Maggies also boasts a 
small organic grocery, case and a decent array 
of merchandise, including vegan chocolates, 
teas, and cookbooks.
Because Maggies is the only strictly vegan 
place in Pittsburgh, it was hard for the 
management to predict what its customer 
base would look like, which has posed 
some setbacks for the restaurant in its first 
few weeks. According to Miller, Maggies 
anticipated a groundswell of support from 
a younger audience, but the diners have 
varied widely in age. Maggies expected to be 
serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but the 
crowd is predominantly a lunch crowd with 
a small contingent of customers for dinner. 
The restaurant is holding off on breakfast until 
there is more demand.
It seems that Maggies also expected that 
diners would be willing to pay a little more 
for their food than these first few weeks have 
shown. The hot and cold bars both currently 
sell food at $9 per pound, which, when 
combined with a drink and a baked goodie on 
the side, puts the average meal between $8 
and $12, a price that is noticeably higher than 
neighboring lunch places that offer vegetarian 
options such as Kiva Han, Eat Unique, Little 
Asia, and Ali Baba.
Maggies, however, has been active in 
adjusting to the realities of its location and 
later this month will be discussing price 
changes that might attract more customers, 
especially students who can only afford an 
inexpensive lunch.

Bump what people say about not 
having your cake and eating it too. 
Whats the point of having cake if you 
cant eat it?
But really, find scholarships and 
aid where you can. There may be 
opportunities for you to get a grant 
for your summer internship. And while 
youre working in San Francisco, 
maybe you can get a part-time job or 
freelance in something youre good 
at to make money on the side. Then, 
since you won't have loans- to pay 
back for your undergrad, itll be a little 
bit okay to take some out for grad 
school. You only get educated once. 
And if you really think grad school is 
going to help you out later in life, do 
what you can to make it. Besides, you 
can always get a job while youre in 
New York attending grad school.
To answer your question in your own 
terms, go in debt and live forever 
with opportunities, regret-free, 
and financially ruined. Then marry 
rich and lay all your financial ruins 
on your significant other. Wrong 
but oh-so-right.

Youre being too hard on yourself, 
first of all. This is your best friend, and 
you want whats best for her. If that 
conflicts with her opinion or even the 
moral standard, then whatever; you 
are entitled to your own opinion, no 
matter what.
I dont, however, think its cool to woo 
her towards abortion unfairly. If you 
think giving up her baby is what's best, 
do some research. Give her some 
statistical information, some real-life 
examples, and show her that maybe 
her extremely early 20s arent the best 
time to rear a child. It seems your 
friend isn't so into what her parents 
think - its more about what her boo 
thinks. Which is fine, and all, until he 
leaves her with that baby alone. And 
. thats going to suck. So give her 
options. If youre going to influence 
her opinion, do it responsibly. If she 
makes a decision thats different from 
your own, thatll suck; but as a best 
friend, its your responsibility to support 
her decisions, whether they are poorly 
made or wisely thought out.

MayurSASA hosts Pakistan Awareness Week
Allison Piper | Assistant Photo Editor
Last week, Mayur: South Asian Student Alliance 
(MayurSASA) hosted Pakistan Awareness Week, a 
compilation of events aimed at increasing knowledge 
about Pakistani issues, politics, and culture on campus. 
The tagline for the event, Experience the country 
behind the headlines," stemmed from recent news, like 
articles in The Economist and Newsweek declaring 
Pakistan one of the most dangerous places to be today. 
MayurSASA aimed to move past the negative publicity 
and bring forward the rich traditions and culture that 
make the Islamic Republic of Pakistan the interesting 
country it is.
Recently, Pakistan has been in the news for a lot of 
reasons, mainly concerning the danger behind [the 
country], and the students on this campus are going 
to see the covers of these articles and not realize that 
theres a lot more behind the country. There is a culture, 
a religion, people, families, and stories, said Sarah 
Sheikh, a sophomore business administration major, 
who spearheaded the project.
The week, which began on March 31 and ran through 
April 4, saw different Pakistan-related events each day. 
It began with "Pakistan Today: Islamism, Activism, 
Performance," a lecture by Fawzia Afzal-Khan, an 
accomplished author, professor, and singer. Afzal-Khan 
spoke broadly about her childhood experiences, the 
books she has written, and the current state of Pakistan.
On Tuesday, an event called Fashion With a Story" 
focused on the burqa, the traditional garment of 
Pakistani women. For the event, volunteers gathered on 
the Cut wearing colorful burqas, holding up signs with 
messages like Underneath this Veil is a Philanthropist"
to send a message.
"This isn't saying that in the modern cities of Pakistan, 
women are all wearing colorful burqas. People in 
America tend to think that these women are forced into 
[wearing burqas], but in some cases  Im not saying 
all  it is a personal choice, Sheikh said. We wanted 
to show that there are women who choose to [wear 
them] because they like to go out in public and not be 
judged. They like to be hidden and known for what they 
do instead of how they look.
Sruthi Reddy, a first-year electrical and computer 
engineering major who volunteered at the event, also 
had strong views. We always see these women [who 
wear burqas] from the outside, and wonder why they 
dont go against wearing it, but I think it takes great 
amount of courage to wear a burqa, as all you have is 
a net to see the world through," Reddy said. It takes 
a great amount of courage to remove the burqa and 
go against your traditions, but I think it takes an even 
greater amount of courage to abide by the traditions 
and norms and wear it. People need to understand how 
hard it is for a woman to wear a burqa and respect her 
for her actions."
On Wednesday, a Pakistani movie titled Khuda ke liye 
(meaning "In the Name of God" in Urdu) was screened 
in Giant Eagle Auditorium. The film is internationally 
acclaimed, having won an award for Best Picture at 
the 31st Cairo International Film Festival, and focuses 
on how the lives of Muslims have been altered in the 
post-9/11 world. An eye-opening film, Khuda ke liye 
depicts educated, modern Muslims encountering 
difficulties both internationally and within their Muslim
communities. In the film, fundamentalist Muslims 
criticize and harass them for their views and ways of 
living, while in the United States they are met with 
suspicion just because they bear Muslim names.
The next day showcased Pakistani culture through 
music, featuring performances by Pakistani students 
at Carnegie Mellon. The event featured a new kind 
of music, strengthened by strong voices and musical 
instruments to audiences delight.
At the weeks close, a debate called "PAKISTAN: The 
Future" provided a forum for participants to discuss 
the current state of Pakistan, including the necessity 
of a democratic government and possible restrictions 
on U.S. intervention. Amid strong words and bold 
statements, both listeners and speakers attempted to 
draw conclusions on how the situation in Pakistan can 
be improved, resulting in a fulfilling and educational 
debate.
In whole, Pakistan Awareness Week proved a truly 
enlightening experience for participants and attendees 
alike. Even if two people had taken something from 
this entire week about Pakistan, it would have been 
successful. And the fact that such a large number of 
students did makes it even better, Sheikh said.
The weeks events were filmed by Voice of America, 
a multimedia service broadcasting in 45 different 
languages, and will be aired in Pakistan.

students could enjoy the films regardless of which 
languages,they understand. This years theme is 
"Cultures and Conflicts, and each film relates to this 
concept in its own way.
The event was organized by members of the Modern 
Languages Student Advisory Council (MLSAC) 
to make students aware of the modern language 
department and expand MLSAC's membership. They 
opened the screenings to the Pittsburgh community  
in an effort to bring students and community 
members together through the experience of learning 
about other cultures.
We want to raise awareness about the different 
languages that are taught here at [Carnegie Mellon] 
and make sure that they're culturally relevant to 
students," said Alyx Kronstein, a junior linguistics and 
Russian studies major and president of MLSAC.
[The film festival] is a good opportunity for us to offer 
free movies for the community, said Nicole Hallinen, 
a junior psychology and French and Francophone 
studies major. Anyone in the community can come. 
Its a really acceptable way of learning about other 
countries." Admission is free for everyone, Hallinen 
added.
This year, the group made sure that food accompanied 
every movie, both to entice more people to attend the 
events and to add an additional cultural element.
Were making the effort to have food with every 
movie so its more interesting, Hallinen said. "It 
draws more people, and they can learn more about a 
snack they have in that country.
In an attempt to heighten visibility and recruit 
new members, the group held a Late Night event, 
organized by Nicole Hallinen on Friday following the 
showing of the fourth film in the series, C.R.A.Z. Y., in 
French. The film details the struggle of a son willing 
to live a lie to gain the love of his father. Baked goods 
for the event were donated by Allegro Hearst Bakery 
in Squirrel Hill. In addition, the group provided Italian 
biscotti to accompany its screening of the Italian film 
The Golden Door on Thursday, donated by Enrico's 
Biscotti in the Strip District. The Golden Door follows 
the life of a poor Sicilian family in the early 1900s that 
leaves Italy for America-in search of a better life.
Other films screened were Nobody Knows in 
Japanese, on March 21, which is based on true 
events and depicts the lives of four children and 
how they survive after their mother abandons them; 
The Edukators in German, on March 26, about three 
German activists who break into the homes of wealthy 
people as an act of political rebellion; and Duck 
Season in Spanish, on March 27, which depicts two
14-year-olds, a pizza man, and a girl next door and 
how they are forced to relate to each other when a 
power outage cancels their plans for the day.
The group will show Saving Face, in Chinese, this
Wednesday at 7 p.m., and The Italian, in Russian, 
on April 16 at 7 p.m. Saving Face revolves around 
a successful Chinese-American surgeon in New 
York and the challenges she faces when her single 
mother arrives at her apartment. The Italian is about 
an orphan who tries to find his mother in light of his 
imminent adoption by an Italian couple.
The festival is the main event that MLSAC plans each 
year. Planning began last year, when the group chose 
the films to be screened and developed the festival's 
Cultures and Conflict theme.
All the films interpret conflict in different ways, 
Hallinen said. With all of them you can believe them 
to be some form of conflict, even though in some of 
them it might be more direct physical fighting, and 
others it may be more abstract, like cultural conflict 
between different cultures?.
Kronstein estimated that a total of 10 to 15 people 
jplayed a part in executing the festival, the majority 
of the MLSAC members and associated faculty 
and staff. In addition to Kronstein and Hallinen, 
student organizers included Lauren Balderston, a 
senior information systems major and film festival 
chairperson, Isabel Gardocki, a senior English major 
and film festival public relations chair, Nicholas 
Cole, a junior history major and film festival finance 
chair, Tokiea Fitzgerald, a sophomore psychology 
and philosophy major and MLSAC secretary, and 
Eric Tang, a masters student in electrical and 
computer engineering and MLSAC treasurer. They 
were aided by MLSAC faculty advisor and Spanish 
professor Felipe Gomez, Japanese professor Sono 
Takano-Hayes, modern languages undergraduate 
coordinator Sue Connelly, and modern languages 
business manager Nancy Monda. The film festival 
committee did all the legwork to make the event 
happen, including ordering some of the films from 
other countries and asking local businesses to donate 
the food that accompanies the screenings.
For Hallinen and Kronstein, ironing out these minor 
details is well worth it once the festival is up and 
running.
I love when I see a lot of people from community 
come and how they interact with university students. 
People our age get a bad rap for being lazy and 
unproductive, but were being productive trying to 
put on something for the community and showing 
them that we can contribute. I like seeing how people 
come together, Kronstein said.
We want to show that in learning a language you 
can do interesting things besides write essays or read 
novels, Hallinen added. You can go understand a 
movie or learn cultural things in addition to what you 
learn in class.

On hating Vampire Weekend
Vampire Weekends self-titled debut album has been on WRCTs top 10 
for several weeks, and this week is no exception. The band is the talk of 
Pitchfork Media and a variety of blogs, got 4.5 stars from Rolling Stone, 
was named Years Best New Band by Spin magazine, and all you indie 
kids have been gleefully clapping to its song Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa 
for the past six months.
If you are not yet familiar with Vampire Weekend, the group is composed of 
four Columbia University grads who create catchy indie-pop. The players 
toured with The Shins, and they cite an afro-pop blog (www.bennloxo. 
com) as one of their sources of inspiration. These guys  just like a lot of 
the guys I hang out with  are thoroughly intelligent, well-dressed, and 
friendly. They surf the Internet and they make short films.
Seemingly cool guys, really. I desperately want to love their album. For 
some reason, though, their music makes my stomach turn. Every attempt 
to sit through all 11 songs has been halted by some primitive repulsion.
Vocalist Ezra Koenig describes the ideal Vampire Weekend in an interview 
with The Bwog (www.bwog.net) as preppiness with West African guitar 
pop, a perfect fusion of happy world music with Western, New England 
preppiness. Oh, is it preppy music, Ezra?
Wikipedia describes the slang usage oipreppy adequately: In recent years, 
young people have begun to use the term preppy to describe those who 
strive to appear better off financially or socially than others in a middle-class 
environment.... The slang version most often describes publicly educated 
people absorbed in the middle-class hypermaterialistic pop culture pursuit 
of ostensibly quality-made goods sold at prices attainable by almost all 
Americans (emphasis added).
Vampire Weekends endeavor to appear well off (or, rather, flaunt this 
privilege) shines through each of the debut's tracks. The players take 
the visceral bob and sway of the afro-pop theyre so in love with, correct 
their pitch and replace them with crisp synths, crooning vocals, and an 
over-processed drum set. To me, at least, Vampire Weekends sound 
reflects a paternal colonial view of Africa that persists despite the band 
members highly-publicized Ivy League education. 
And the band members are sure to make their education and lifestyle shine 
through their nauseating lyrics  which mention til Jon, Benetton, Louis 
Vuitton, Darjeeling tea, Oxford commas, the Khyber Pass, the dowdiness of 
a sweatshirt, and a soiled keffiyeh. Additionally, they complain about Cape 
Cod and treat New Jersey like some gritty exotic escape. How adorably 
and provincially tragic!
Perhaps Im taking Vampire Weekend far too seriously  although the 
band members, along with music journalism as a whole, seem to be 
taking their skyrocketing success pretty damn seriously. If so, I really hope 
Vampire Weekend is a (very unfunny) joke.

Here comes the bloodshed
University of Pittsburgh performs Big Love
Assisting the acting, the characters' costumes help 
to define and embolden each of the roles. The Italians, 
for example, are united in their purple garb, a theme 
we eventually see extend-to the grooms' corsages. As 
mentioned earlier, the brides wardrobes are white 
throughout, but each outfit still manages to perfectly 
match its character; in the beginning of the play, we see 
the aggressive Thyona in a mens white button-down, the 
prissy Olympia in cool capri pants and ballet flats, and the 
down-to-earth Lydia in a minimal tank top. Later, when 
they change into their wedding dresses, these three sport 
empowering vinyl, girly ruffles, and classic simplicity, 
respectively.
What unites all of these elements is the plays directing, 
executed by Melissa Rynn Porterfield. Porterfield takes 
skillful advantage of comedic timing, dealing with both 
dialogue and the silhouetted dancers. One the plays most 
memorable moments is when the three brides perform a 
passionate, almost tribal dance expressing their conflicting 
feelings toward the opposite sex; the grooms later mimic 
this performance, griping about the pressures of manhood. 
Both extremely satisfying, the male and female dances are 
the work of choreographer Lily Junker. If anything, Big Love 
only suffers from an overwhelming amount of action, as 
the words and movements of three or more characters at a 
time are often hard to take in, especially in the Heymann 
Theatres intimate setting.
Sarah Mogin | Editor-in-Chief
Big Love runs through April 13 at the Henry Heymann 
Theatre in the Stephen Foster Memorial at the University 
of Pittsburgh. Call 412-624-PLAY or visit www.play.pitt. 
edu. Also beginning this week at Pitt is William Cymbeline, 
opening Wednesday'St the Cathedral of Learning's Studio 
Theatre.
In Big Love, the poorly matched 
Constantine (Parag S. Gohel) and 
Thyona (Brittany Andrews) argue 
over pretty much everything.
Television shows like Bridezillas and Whose Wedding is 
it Anyway? do a good job of capturing the drama of one 
wedding with one bride at the helm, so you can imagine the 
kind of chaos inherent in a ceremony featuring five brides, 10 
brides, or even more. The University of Pittsburgh Repertory 
Theatres aptly named Big Love takes things to the extreme, 
telling the story of 50 reluctant brides and their 50 eager 
grooms. What results is an entertaining and surprisingly 
morbid performance, calling into question the sanctity of 
marriage.
The brainchild of playwright Charles L. Mee, Big Love is 
a modernization of Aeschyluss The Supplicants', like the 
original, Big Love follows its 50 heroines as they flee from 
Greece to Italy in an attempt to avoid a trip down the 
aisle. The brides are all sisters, coHectively opposed to an 
agreement their father signed years ago, which obliges the 
ladies to marry their 50 cousins. In Italy, the brides throw 
themselves upon the mercy of a wealthy family (basically, the 
first dock their boat encounters), begging for protection from 
their cousins, who'are after them. All of the action takes place 
on their wedding day  the intended one, anyway  so 
throughout the show we see the girls wearing various white 
outfits and the men in tuxedos.
Of course, 50 brides and 50 grooms on stage would be a little 
bit excessive. In Big Love, the two parties are represented by 
three women and three men, each portraying a stereotype 
of his or her gender. Exemplifying the angry, man-eating 
woman is Thyona (Brittany Andrews), an independent, 
militant bride, ironically betrothed to Constantine (Parag S. 
Gohel), a misogynist if there ever was one. Thyonas sister 
Olympia (Elizabeth Gardner) represents the opposite end of 
the spectrum, with curly blonde locks, a ditzy demeanor, and 
the desire to be taken care of by a man  still, she would - 
prefer a man of her choosing. Olympia is engaged to Oedipus 
(Steward Savage), who goes by Ed," a Neanderthal-type 
character who understands little, except that he wants to 
get married. Balancing out the polar-opposite sisters is Lydia
(Kaitlyn Wittig), the levelheaded voice of reason; Nikos (Allen 
Clark), her husband-to-be, serves the same function for his 
two brothers.
These six characters interact with an only slightly less-zany 
cast of Italian oddballs. ThefOwner of the stumbled-upon 
manor is Piero (Ryan Howe), who is willing to help the 
brides as long as his efforts dont hurt himself or his family. 
Piero lives with his mother, Bella (Lauren Ann Diesch), 
who has grown wise after mothering nearly a dozen boys. 
Rounding out the story is the lovably flamboyant Giuliano 
(John Graham), whose comically exaggerated gestures and 
mannerisms help to offset the show's darker themes.
And Big Love is dark. All foreshadowing aside, all you have 
to do is look at the cover of the program to realize that the 
story ends in bloodshed; on the cover (and, eventually, on 
stage), we see a bloody groom lying dead on the ground. The 
murderous turn of events.begins when the brides realize that 
Piero will not be able to help them evade their marital contract 
and, in desperation, make plans to kill their grooms after the 
wedding. This is, of course, Thyona's idea  she wouldnt be 
a very good militant feminist otherwise, would she?
The acting, costume design, and direction of Pitts Big Love 
serve to amplify an already-intriguing story. Andrews excels 
as the over-the-top Thyona, while Gardner captures Olympias 
air-headed personality, reeling herself in to avoid creating 
a caricature. Lydia, too, manages to portray her character's 
relative sanity without fading into the background. The 
brothers are each perfectly cast, coming off as hilarious 
(Savage, as Ed), sweet (Clark, as Nikos), and terrifying (Gohel, 
as Constantine)  clearly in line with what the'playwright 
originally intended. Additionally, Graham (playing Giuliano)  
and two entertaining houseguests (played by Grant Williams 
and Emily Simpson) surpass the-realm of comic relief, often 
stealing the show. Dancers Lily Junker and Mark Chaitin also 
contribute to the action, embodying the words and feelings of 
the other characters as subtly visible silhouettes.

Junot Diaz speaks at Carnegie Mellon
Award-winning author lectures on writing and life at a tech university
Last Monday, author Junot Diaz visited campus in an 
event presented by AB Lectures. Addressing a more than 
half-empty auditorium, he tried to have a conversation with 
the audience on being writers, learning in an ultra-technical 
environment like Carnegie Mellon, and existing outside of 
culture.
 /
Diaz began by reading the short story "Boyfriend from 
his 1996 collection, Drown, that describes the relationship 
between a man and his upstairs neighbor who has just been 
left by her boyfriend. He read this first as a way to jump into 
one of his main philosophies about writing, which is showing 
humans through their relationships. He said it was almost 
impossible to see a character outside of their relationships 
and that pages of description can never accomplish the same 
effect as the interaction between creations.
Diaz has a gift for describing these interactions. His use of 
conversational dialogue, body language, and creation of what 
can best be described as awkward moments give reality to 
his fiction. But these relationships also describe class, race, 
and personal differences between his characters, themes that 
drive his work.
Diaz was born in the D'ominican Republic and, moved to 
New Jersey when he was 6. He understands well the idea of 
being an outsider, but suggests we are all outsiders to certain 
cultures. This is where The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar 
Wao, his first novel, succeeds. By creating a 
novel that shifts between
conditions of a Trujillo-dominated Dominican Republic,
.the trials of puberty in Jersey, and the science-fiction and 
comic-book world of a socially inept teenage boy, Diaz gives 
readers enough context to find something to connect to, while 
leaving plenty of other elements open for exploration.
While his novel has won the National Book Critics Circle 
Award and the Sargent First Novel Prize, Diaz remains 
humble and maintains that he is not yet in the class of writers 
who can, in his words, get "that square-bottled Hawaiian 
water at their readings. And even though he isnt there, 
he likes the lower pressure of not being a top-tier writer. He 
can continue to write whatever he wants without constant 
revisions by editors  and can keep reading, an activity he 
believes necessary for modern writers.
On life at Carnegie Mellon
Apart from reading and writing, Diaz focused in his talk on 
life at Carnegie Mellon. Diaz currently serves as an associate 
professor of creative writing at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. Teaching at such a technology-focused school 
has made him aware of another culture, that of the students 
who change their lives to fit in at such a place. He spoke 
of the discipline required and the huge sacrifices students 
have to make to succeed at universities, but he worries that 
compassion and empathy are the first things students remove 
from their lives. He joked that this dedication could drive 
students to inexplicable things. He said of these students, 
if their hand was stuck in a trap they would immediately 
volunteer seemingly straightforward solutions like I can saw 
this shit off.
On the same day Diaz visited us, The Brief Wonderous Life 
of Oscar Wao was announced as the winner of The Morning 
News' (www.themorningnews.org) Tournament of Books, an 
Internet hipster book contest, something the tech-obsessed 
Carnegie Mellon populace can likely align themselves with. 
Yet the crowd's questions focused more on his writing 
process, what to read, and how closely Oscar's life mirrors 
Diaz's own.
The empty chairs in the room represented all the students 
who couldnt tear themselves away from their own work to 
come hear a popular writer speak. Diazs words seem to ring 
true: The discipline required to cut it at Carnegie Mellon 
keeps people away from the seriously talented speakers who 
frequent our classrooms and auditoriums; students are too 
busy amputating their own limbs to survive.
On reading
Diaz devoted part of his lecture to recommending other novels 
for students to read. If you need some help getting started 
(and decide not read Diazs own novel) here are some books 
that he recommends:
Texaco  Patrick Chamoiseau 
Midnight's Children  Salman Rushdie 
Almanac of the Dead  Leslie Marmon Silko 
A Fine Balance  Rohinton Mistry

Smart People is finally premiering 
this week across the nation, and 
we get to see it a whole day early.
In case you dont know what its 
about, heres a quick rundown: 
Dennis Quaid, a Carnegie Mellon 
professor, and his daughter Vanessa, 
Junos Ellen Page, lead your typical 
dismal, dysfunctional, everyday 
Carnegie Mellon life. Sarah Jessica 
Parker and Thomas Haden Church 
[Splder-Man 3's Sandman) come in 
and do that traditional life-fixing thing 
inspirational people do in movies like 
Garden State and Elizabethtown. It 
is cute, sweet, and Scrabble tiles are 
involved. Dont go: Thomas Haden 
Church scares you. Go: Whats more 
mind blowing than watching a movie 
set at Carnegie Mellon when youre 
actually at Carnegie Mellon?

I come from South Florida, land of the 
old people. As a result, I refuse to watch 
a movie about old people  I like to 
take advantage of my youth. But hey, if 
you want to watch a movie about what 
Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman 
would do if they had only six months 
to live, heres what you need to know: 
The movie is slightly inspirational, kind 
of fun, a little life thrilling, but ultimately 
fairly cheesy and overdone  I would 
only watch it because I wish Morgan 
Freeman would narrate my life. But 
its about old people, and as such, Im 
spending my Saturday night doing what 
they only wish they could.
Slither

Gore, slugs, zombies, slugs, blood, 
Jabba the Hutt, slugs. And thats 
pretty much what Slither is about. 
Did I mention that the rfiovie is 
covered in slugs? If you can get 
past the slimy, disgusting, bloody
 gore, Slither is actually supposed 
to be a pretty good thriller for those 
hard-core enthusiasts that liked 
Dawn of the Dead. Its also fairly 
funny from what I hear, but when 
your husband is infested with slugs, 
what isnt hilarious?

Work meets play in Sc
J by Amanda Cole | Pillbox Editor
Last weekend, students from the School of Drama came 
together in the annual independent student works festival, 
Playground. Playground is a three-day festival in which 
students create their own experimental works to be 
performed or shown during the festival. During this years 
event, all performances were free and open to the public, and 
the pieces varied in style from mockumentaries, to vintage 
black-and-white silent films, to live musical performances.
The festival kicked off Thursday evening with an opening 
ceremony. During the ceremony, a slideshow of photographs  
set to music from the week's rehearsals was shown amid 
cheering and laughter from the students in the audience.
After the photographs, a video mockumentary {The Drama 
Office) showed what happened in the planning committee 
in the style of the popular television show The Office, even 
using the same theme song.
In addition, the head of the School of Drama, Elizabeth 
Bradley, spoke about her vision for Playground, which 
she started five years ago in order to give the students an 
opportunity to produce their own creative works.
The atmosphere of Playground is laid-back, and students are 
encouraged to be experimental and creative.
"Playground is an amazing festival. It is one of my favorite 
things about the School of Drama. I feel privileged to go 
to a school that allows its students this opportunity," said 
sophomore drama major Amanda Cooper.
There is nothing like seeing your work, said MFA drama 
student Rob Smith. Playground is that: Its a time to play. Its
a time to go out on a limb and try, experiment, do that one 
thing you've wanted to do but haven't had the time to do. Its 
putting all your training and knowledge to the test, or in my 
case, making fun of it.
Students can participate in as many pieces as they choose, 
but in this case, less may be more.
I participated in fthree pieces freshman year, Cooper said.
"It was hectic, exciting, intimidating, daunting, and amazing 
all at the same time. My experience this year, in choosing 
to participate in one single piece, has allowed me to garner 
more of a leadership role and put all of my energy into [one] 
project."
The Closed Theatre
The first student work after the opening ceremony was 
Smiths mockumentary, The Closed Theatre, which is about 
a theater group of the same name that is never seen.^The film 
claims that the group can instead be felt, because its acting 
is so powerful.
The Closed Theatre is a project I started at the end of 
last year, Smith said. "My first year was an intense study 
of playwriting and theater, so I wanted to make fun of 
everything I had learned. Since its a movie about theater, 
what better place to screen it than for theater people?"
In the film, director Sean Bean (pronounced shon bon  hes 
French-Polynesian, so it rhymes) is attempting to organize 
a show in which the doors will be closed and no one will be 
allowed in. The actors are given instructions to begin a scene 
without moving or speaking. Then, Sean Bean runs out of the 
room to see whether the actors are successful in making the
Playground 2008 showcases
scene felt to those outside of the theater.
 Sean Bean tells the camera that the Closed Theatre is 
well-known for having the youngest Lady Macbeth ever  
Morgana, who played the role, was only 8 years old. At the 
performance directed by Sean Bean, the camera is forced 
to wait outside the door. We never find out what happened 
during the show, but we are told by Morgana that it wasnt 
about pedophilia.
The film, which started as a final project for a course taken by 
Smith, took two weeks of planning and one week of filming 
and editing.
The Closed Theatre was a humorous parody of how the 
theater world really works. The use of both students and 
faculty members also made this film unique, allowing the 
latter to be portrayed in a humorous light. In one case, a 
faculty member runs out of the interview to "show the 
camera a performance (which the audience is supposed to 
feel, not see) and becomes angry when the camera follows 
him. He refuses to continue the interview, then soon after 
changes his mind, resuming the interview.
I was happy with the screening, but I have a feeling Ill keep 
working on this project, Smith said.
A Soft Crime
Sophomore drama major Graham Swindoll showed his film, A 
Soft Crime, Friday afternoon. The film, which was silent and 
in black and white, was divided into several named sections, 
such as A Friend is a Friend. Swindoll wrote, directed, and 
filmed the piece.

pillbOX 04.07.08

---------------------------------------------------

The movie begins with a woman painting her nails. After she 
finishes, there is a scene in which a-bag of money is taken 
from a box. The audience doesnt really see more of this 
crime or the woman with painted nails, but in the programs 
description of the play, it defines "soft," saying, "Yielding 
readily to touch or pressure; easily penetrated, divided, or 
changed in shape. Given this definition, the audience is led 
to expect that the crime will somehow be changed through 
the course of the film.
The scene shifts to show two friends together, played by 
drama sophomores Lora Lee Gayer (the blonde) and Sophia 
Feldman (the brunette). The friends hang out together in an 
old house .doing things like cutting each others hair. When 
the brunette friend is beaten by a man, her friend watches 
from a hidden location. Later, the women kill the man, 
transforming the crime from a theft into a murder.
Many segments looked like old home videos, creating a 
pleasant effect  the subjects appeared very natural and the 
costumes were truly reminiscent of older times. The makeup 
techniques provided a good contrast of colors, making the 
use of black-and-white filming effective.
The Count of Monte Cristo
Alexandre Dumas' classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, 
was brought to the stage by Amanda Cooper. The musical 
version was written by Brett Boles, a then-senior at Ithaca 
College. Boles came to Carnegie Mellon to direct Cooper's
show while she worked as the assistant director of the show. 
I read about the production, talked to a few people who 
had seen it, and thought 'This could be a great Playground 
piece,' Cooper said. I contacted Brett Boles, the composer 
and lyricist, through an array of online searching, and we 
decided it would be a great opportunity."
Because each show had to be 45 minutes long or less, much 
of the script was cut; some of the musical numbers were 
cut in half, and parts of the plot were skipped altogether.
For example, a main part of The Count of Monte Cristo 
is Edmonds revenge, and the Playground performance 
skimmed over this by having a narrator announce what 
had happened. This by no means made the performance 
unsuccessful;" in fact, it added an element of humor to an 
otherwise solemn musical.
Like other Playground pieces, the cast had only one week 
to learn their parts and rehearse. During the first half of 
the week, the cast learned its vocal and speaking parts.
The rest of the week was spent choreographing the stage 
performance with Boles, who traveled from Connecticut to 
help with the production.
In the story, Edmond (drama sophomore Nick Cosgrove) is 
wrongly incarcerated in a French prison, where he meets 
Faria (drama sophomore Ross Francis), an older man who is 
also serving time in prison. Faria teaches Edmond how to 
be noble, making him promise not to use what he learns for 
revenge  a promise Edmond does not keep.
Meanwhile, Mercedes (Cooper), Edmonds fiancee, marries 
Fernand (drama junior Bernie Balbot), the man who betrayed 
Edmond and was responsible for his imprisonment. After 
Edmond exacts his revenge, Mercedes refuses to take him 
back, and the show ends with a full ensemble performance.
The cast and orchestra both performed well, giving the 
impression of a group that had rehearsed for more than a 
week. The vocals were strong and, despite the cuts made to 
the show, it was an enjoyable experience.
They Say I Have...
They Say I Have..., located in the lobby bathroom stairs at 
Purnell, is an exhibit by sophomore drama major Alana Clapp 
of an assortment of photographs portraying different body 
parts. The photographs are sepia-toned and some are torn, 
appearing to be ripped from magazines.
The point of the exhibit is to show that everyone is beautiful 
in some way; the tagline in the program states that everyone 
should love a part of themselves." The photographs portray 
different body parts ranging from eyes to backs.
A blurb next to the photographs says', It doesnt matter what 
shape or size, everyone has something that is beautiful."
This statement rang true throughout Playground weekend, as 
each piece showcased a unique blend of actors and talents 
brought together by Carnegie Mellon students.

---------------------------------------------------

Did you know?
April 8, 1908
Carnegie Techs baseball team is 
mercilessly slaughtered by West Virginia 
by a score of 23-0. To help liven the 
spirits of the humiliated players, a dance 
is held in their honor. I guess students 
wanted to give the athletes another 
chance to score.
April 15, 1958
Those looking for swinging times and 
nite dancing for Carnival 58 will be 
pleased see Art Mooney and his band 
announced in The Tartan as this years 
musical entertainment. With hints of 
Glenn Miller, Art Mooney's music mostly 
focuses on smooth dance numbers. 
Thankfully, students back then didnt 
have to listen to anything like The 
Roots, who to this day refuse to make 
tunes that you can waltz to.
April 5, 1983
After a long search, a Tartan writer 
named Nate finally announces a winner 
for the Win a date with Nate contest. 
To console the thousands who were 
not selected, Nate highlights the best 
answers to his application questions. 
One particular favorite was the student 
who wrote Not Hall & Oates for favorite 
music.
April 6, 1998
A Tartan editorial requests a new 
system for grading TAs. Suggestions 
for changing the old system include 
mid-semester evaluations and minimum 
proficiency standards. While most TAs 
see these suggestions as opportunities 
to improve their teaching, a vocal 
minority are crying This aint fair!" and 
I is good right teaching now anyhow!
April 7, 2003
Students debate whether +/- grading 
should be implemented. As a test for 
the system, students received their 
mid-semester grades with pluses and 
minuses, a system that continues to 
this day, just like the debate about +/- 
grading. According to a Tartan article in 
2003, Student Senate strongly opposes 
extending this kind of grading to final 
grades. However, that guy that wont 
shut up in class about how easy the last 
test was fully supports the issue.
April 9, 2007'
The 28X, Carnegie Mellons favorite 
airport-bound public bus, will continue 
running, ending several months 
of speculation about its possible 
X-termination. Had the bus been 
discontinued, students would have 
been forced to find alternative forms 
of transportation to the airport, such' 
as taxis, friends' cars, of one of those 
bicycles we gave out last year that I 
can't seem to find.

Campus chic
Body-conscious dressing
Short-sleeve and shorts weather is finally starting to emerge, 
and it is an exciting time, as it signals fresh wardrobes and 
unfussy pieces. Mixing styles and layers may be trickier, but 
the beauty of sunny days is dressing simply and still looking 
great.
The key to minimalist style is to dress for the body  this 
means taking advantage of certain silhouettes while avoiding 
others. Not every trendy piece is automatically flattering; 
rather, it is about the wearer who learns to dress smartly for 
his or her body type.
For those with pear-shaped bodies, emphasizing the smallest 
part of the body, the waist area, is essential. It is also 
imperative to flatter the curves, and take the time to seek out 
the right pieces. Empire-waist dresses, pieces that cinch and 
nip at the waist, and those that elongate legs are always sure 
hits.
Sophomore art major Mahsa Borhani confidently dresses 
for her body shape while still exuding style and grace.
Taking a cue from her earthy surroundings, Borhani wears 
color schemes and patterns that reflect a bohemian, hippie 
influence, I absolutely love vintage, unique pieces, she said. 
She also follows trends closely-by visiting blogs like www.
' whowhatweaidaily.com, a site that captures celebrity style, 
while providing its readers with more affordable options.
With slender body types, creating volume, utilizing texture, 
and varying lengths are chic, easy ways to integrate style 
into the framework of the body. Designers like Alexander 
Wang and Aiber Elbaz, creative director of Lanvin, have been 
lauded for creating dramatic, feminine pieces. Theyre known 
for designing modern, wearable and sustainable dresses that 
are timeless and confident.
Senior chemical and biomedical engineering student 
Jessica Tsang wears a few simple pieces that fuse together 
seamlessly. She takes advantage of her slim silhouette 
by wearing a textured cropped jacket with flecks of gold.
To offset the short length, Tsang wears a grey tunic that 
lengthens her torso. Adding on small details, she wears a 
midnight-blue scarf and pointy black flats with cutout straps.
Regardless of body shape, if you invest the time to pick out 
and try on different pieces, the look will almost always work. 
It is not about what you wear, but how you wear it. Following 
this philosophy, Borhani exhibits great style without 
sacrificing her personality, and Tsangs carefree outfit proves 
just how style-sawy she is.
