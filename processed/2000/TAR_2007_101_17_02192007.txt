Its time for 
summer 
grants!
by Mona Maher
Junior Staffwriter
As students begin to make 
summer plans, one option is of
ten largely ignored  research. 
Often discounted because it is 
expensive to conduct and not as 
lucrative as a job or internship, 
research can provide valuable 
experience in the lab, studio, 
field, or wherever a students 
interests lead him or her. Be
low are some resources offered 
through Carnegie Mellon that 
enable students to both afford 
and experience the benefits of 
research.

Tuition will increase 4.1 
percent for current students 
beginning in fall 2007, accord
ing to a February 16 university 
press release. Students who en
tered Carnegie Mellon in 2003, 
2004, or 2005 will pay $34,405 
for the 2007 - 2008 academic 
year, while those who entered 
in 2006 will pay $35,580.
Tuition for students entering 
next fall will be $36,950, up 8.1 
percent from last years rate.
Despite rising costs, more stu
dents are applying to Carnegie 
Mellon. As of the beginning of 
February, Carnegie Mellon had 
received a record 22,052 appli
cations, a 19.2 percent increase 
over last year, the press release 
stated.
The difference in tuition 
rates among classes is due to 
the universitys tiered tuition 
system, a pricing strategy that 
was implemented 10 to 12 years 
ago, said William Elliott, Carn
egie Mellons vice president for 
enrollment. This years sopho
mores, juniors, and seniors 
entered while tuition prices 
were static, so students who 
entered in all three years paid 
the same price. This years firstyears came in at a higher tuition 
cost, and will continue to pay 
more than their older counter
parts, since the rate of increase 
is the same for students of all 
years.
The tuition increase has 
a bigger impact on current 
students than on incoming 
students, Elliott said. While 
current students have already 
invested a significant amount in 
Carnegie Mellon, he explained, 
incoming students have not yet 
committed to a school and can 
decide to accept or reject Carn
egie Mellons offer in favor of a 
less or more expensive school.
However, despite the in
crease, the price of tuition alone 
does not cover the full cost of 
educating a Carnegie Mellon 
student. Each full-time student

Ph.D. in rhetoric student Eric 
Hanbury teaches a section of In
terpretation and Argument on 
conceptions of democracy. The 
class focuses not just on govern

way people perceive cultural 
norms  or, how they notice 
when those norms are inter
rupted.
We get into a routine, and 
the routine becomes familiar, 
Hanbury said. We find faith in 
the familiar.
Monday night, Hanburys 
routine was disrupted when his 
wife, Maria, and their two chil

four years, were kidnapped and 
forced to withdraw money from 
an ATM.

Last Saturday, the Mudge 
House library was louder than 
usual as students in Carnegie 
Mellons chapter of FORGE silkscreened 100 T-shirts to benefit 
African refugees.
FORGE, which stands for 
Facilitating Opportunities for 
Refugee Growth and Empower
ment, is a non-governmental 
organization dedicated to help
ing refugees all over the world. 
Founded in 2003 at Stanford 
University, Carnegie Mellons 
branch was established last year 
by Kate Edgar, a sophomore in
dustrial design major, and Jen 
Johnson, a sophomore anthro
pology and history major.
FORGE mainly focuses on 
providing educational programs 
within refugee camps, such 
as mentoring programs for or
phans. The organization also 
works to promote human rights 
and provide recreational pro
grams.
There are currently at least 
eight chapters of FORGE nation
wide.
The silk-screening was the 
first big event that Carnegie 
Mellons chapter planned and 
held independently from the 
larger chapter at the University 
of Pittsburgh, though students 
from both universities attended.
The goal of this event is to 
raise awareness and provide 
funds to buy blankets and edu
cation material for refugees, 
mostly Congolese, in Africa 
that are currently staying in the 
camps of Zambia, including the 
Meheba refugee camp, Edgar 
said. The profits will be used to 
buy blankets and provide edu
cational support for refugees in 
Zambia. We hope to raise more 
funds at the Baridi Night and 
buy blankets for 500 families. ,
Baridi Night (Baridi means 
cold in Swahili) is a major fund
raising event held by FORGE 
chapters in Pittsburgh, Boston, 
and Los Angeles.
Pittsburghs Baridi Night will 
be held on April 13 at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh.
Africans living in refugee 
camps need blankets and edu
cational material most urgently, 
according to surveys conducted 
in Zambian refugee camps. Al
though blankets were provided 
when families moved into the 
camps, they have since become 
worn out. FORGEs current mis
sion is to provide new blankets 
and replace the worn ones.
Students who participated in 
Saturdays event created their 
own uniquely designed T-shirts 
with paint and four basic silk 
screens. After designing the Tshirts, students could purchase

SURG grants provide fund
ing. for undergraduate students 
to conduct research during 
the fall, spring, and summer 
semesters.
[SURG] is a way to build 
mentor relationships between 
students and faculty. It is also a 
way for students to begin test
ing out a career interest and 
really working to obtain handson experience, said Stephanie 
Wallach, director of the Un
dergraduate Research Office 
(URO). For some students, the 
process of researching and pre
senting their findings is pure 
fun.
Students from any college 
can apply to perform research 
in any field, even if the subject 
is unrelated to their major.
There is a general tendency 
for more applications to come 
from students interested in or 
studying the sciences and engi
neering, said Jen Weidenhof, 
assistant to the director of

Co-ed housing bill awaits approval next week
by Sabrina Porter
Staffwriter
Although not a field of study 
in the Mellon College of Sci
ence, the science of co-ed dorm 
rooms could soon be a topic 
studied by the entire Carn
egie Mellon community. A 
new proposal has suggested a 
university-wide mixed-gender 
housing pilot study that could 
go into effect as early as the 
spring 2007 room draw. The 
proposal would allow students 
to live with a member of the 
opposite sex in university hous
ing.
The plan was proposed by 
the student government last 
December. To increase com
munity awareness, Student
Body President Karl Sjogren, a 
senior SDS major, and Student 
Body Vice President Andrea 
Hamilton, a senior art and eth
ics, history, and public policy 
major, have presented the pro
posal to the Student Dormitory 
Council, Senate, and Housing 
and Student Life Office.
The proposal is awaiting 
approval by Tim Michael, as
sistant vice president for cam
pus services. Michaels decision 
will determine whether or not 
the plan will proceed.
We have received the pro
posal from the student body 
president for gender-neutral 
housing and are still studying it 
and our own benchmarking of 
other college and universities 
that offer such a housing option 
on their campuses, he said.
Since room draw is almost 
ready to begin, we need to 
make a decision next week on 
whether to pursue a pilot or 
wait another year and do fur
ther research.
Sjogren and Hamilton have 
worked to inform the campus 
community about the proposal 
through presentations and by 
soliciting students views in 
order to gauge their level of 
interest in the project.
Currently, housings room 
assignment process is dic
tated only by gender, Sjogren 
and Hamilton stated on their 
website. This prevents stu
dents who would like to live 
in a mixed-gender environ
ment from living in campus 
housing.
The proposal would allow
students of opposite genders 
to share both on-and off-cam
pus residences, beginning 
with the Small Oakland Apart
ments, which include Shady 
Oak, London Terrace, Veronica, 
and Shirley, and expanding 
according to student demand. 
In addition to being able to re
quest to live with or pull in 
someone of the of the opposite 
gender during room draw, cur
rent first-years, sophomores, 
and juniors could specify male, 
female, or no preference when 
entering into the process blind. 
Those who choose to respond 
with no preference might re
turn next fall to a roommate of 
the opposite gender.
The plan will not apply to inSee HOUSING, page A3

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 19, 2007
University will decide 
on co-ed housing pilot
HOUSING, from A1
coming first-year students, who 
would still be assigned a room
mate of the same sex.
Students stated that they 
would opt for the proposed 
choice if they wanted to live 
with a platonic friend between 
opposite genders; if they were 
gay, lesbian, or transgender stu
dents and felt more comfortable 
living with the opposite sex; or 
if they wanted to move in with a 
boyfriend or girlfriend.
It would be a huge step for 
CMU if they offered co-ed hous
ing, said Ellen Parkhurst, GLBT 
intern for the Office of Student 
Development and a sophomore 
policy and management major. 
It would possibly put our cam
pus in the top 20 schools for 
GLBT students.
According to The Advocate, 
Carnegie Mellon ranks in the top 
100 best colleges and universi
ties for GLBT students.
More than 20 colleges and 
universities across the nation 
already offer co-ed housing 
options. Students at Wesleyan 
College, Haverford College, and 
Swarthmore College can choose 
to room with a member of the 
opposite sex, according to a 
February 27, 2002 article in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Wesleyan reported that less 
than one percent of its students 
have taken advantage of the co
ed alternative, and Swarthmore 
and Haverford cited similar per
centages. However, despite the 
low numbers of participants, the 
colleges have continued to offer 
the option for the past several 
years.
Currently, Wesleyan allows 
groups of up to six people, re
gardless of gender, to be entered 
into its annual room selection 
process.
Haverford launched its pro
gram in 2000 and limits the 
option to upperclassmen. Stu
dents apply in groups of three 
by lottery and are placed in 
two-bedroom apartments with 
a shared kitchen, living room, 
and bathroom.
Swarthmore launched its co
ed housing program at the re
quest of the universitys gay and 
lesbian population. The students 
claimed that they would feel 
more comfortable living with a 
person of the opposite gender, 
and viewed the campus hous
ing policies as discriminatory to 
their interests.
All three colleges only place 
students in co-ed housing ar
rangements if they specifically 
request such an arrangement. 
No one is assigned co-ed hous
ing against his or her wishes, the 
Post-Gazette stated.
Single-sex housing, once the 
norm on most campuses, now 
represents a small minority of 
housing options. Only two per
cent of Carnegie Mellons dorms 
are all female and nine percent 
of dorms are all male, according 
to university data.
The single-sex dorm has been 
replaced by the co-ed dorm, 
which now represents about half 
of all campus housing. The re
maining percentage of campus 
housing consists of sororities, 
fraternities, apartments, and 
specialty housing for disabled 
students.
Students behind the new pro
posal are aware of the changes 
the policy would bring to the 
campus community.
[We need] clear communi
cations announcing the pilot 
study to the campus commu
nity, regarding [residential] 
staff-training adjustments, and 
related to transgender students, 
Sjogren and Hamilton stated on 
their website.
Although never officially pro
posed, co-ed housing is not a 
new consideration at Carnegie 
Mellon.
The issue first came up ap
proximately three to four years 
ago in a discussion with trans
sexual students, Sjogren said. 
This is the first time there has 
been a student push for the ini
tiative.
The final decision regarding 
whether to proceed with the pi
lot in time for room draw, which 
begins March 26, is expected 
from administrators within the 
next two weeks.

ated a fund to help Eric and his 
family with some of the financial 
setback caused by this, stated 
David Kaufer, professor and 
head of the English Department, 
via e-mail. I [also] know his 
fellow graduates have supplied 
groceries and other support for 
the family.
Hanbury was not sure how the
case would proceed.
Its in the polices hands, he 
said.
For now, Hanbury has been 
focused on making his students 
and colleagues more aware of 
the incident in hopes that they 
will take precautions to avoid a 
similar situation in the future.
The probability that this 
could happen to you, your family, 
or someone you know is rather 
low, he wrote in an e-mail to 
colleagues in the English Depart
ment. I only write this in hopes 
that the probability can be low
ered still further by being a little 
more watchful  of yourselves 
and others. Please, pay attention 
to your surroundings.
His students were shocked 
when Hanbury recounted the 
incident in front of the class, but 
Hanbury did his best to supply 
them with a learning experi
ence, not a horror story.
If we were a little more aware 
that things arent standard, peo
ple would pay more attention, 
he said.

their own or those of their

equivalent to buying one blan
ket for a family. Many students 
made more than one T-shirt and 
also donated money separately 
from buying a T-shirt.
The remaining T-shirts will 
be sold next week. The shirts 
will contain tags that have in

Edgar said.
Students who participated in 
the event reacted positively to 
the experience.
I wasnt aware of this issue 
before. I stopped by after see
ing the posters that were put up 
around campus, but now I know 
a lot more, said Poamrong Rith, 
a sophomore design major. It 
is much more personalized 
than usual shirt-selling events. 
It gives you a chance to show 
creativity, and it is actually fun. 
There is a lot of dedication in 
each shirt and each one is spe
cial.
The event, which was planned 
to last from 1 to 5 p.m., lasted 
longer than anticipated due to 
the time-consuming processes 
of designing and silk-screening. 
However, many non-FORGE 
participants worked overtime to 
design more shirts.
The members of FORGE hope 
that selling the shirts and orga
nizing Baridi Night will raise 
awareness of refugees in Africa 
and all over the world.
I believe [the silk-screening] 
gives more personal connection 
to the Zambian refugee issue 
while statistics and facts are 
often flat, Edgar said. Even if 
they do not buy anyT-shirts, they 
help the good cause by partici
pating in making T-shirts. They 
will actually be able to explain 
what these shirts mean and how 
it will help the refugees.

First-year MCS student Nabeel Jamal and sophomore civil and environmental engineering major Dave 
Figgins wield large sheets of snow during a snowball fight at Gesling Stadium last Thursday night.
Tuition to increase 4.1 percent
TUITION, from A1
costs the university an average of 
$54,500 a year, according to the 
press release. University fund
raising  including the capital 
campaign, the annual fund, and 
the endowment  covers the re
maining charges.
Weve had to say no to some 
things that we think would ben
efit the university, Elliott said. 
While our endowment is large, 
its modest compared with our 
competitors.
Unrelated to tuition cost, room 
and board costs will also increase 
4.1 percent, to $5663 and $3997, 
respectively.
The majority of cost issues in 
housing and dining are inflation
ary this year, said Tim Michael, 
assistant vice president for Cam
pus Services. We are also try
ing to catch up with large utility 
increases that have outpaced 
inflation over the last three 
years.
In addition, Michael said, the 
increase will fund renovations 
and repairs to housing and din
ing facilities and compensate 
for the increased price of fruits 
and vegetables as a result of the 
winter impact on California and 
Florida growing markets.
All fee increases each year are 
recommended with an eye toward 
both necessary expense increases 
and how those increases affect 
the total cost of attendance for 
students, Michael said. Typi
cally we constrain our requests 
to try to minimize the overall 
impact of the total increase year 
to year. So in trying to manage
the increase in total cost of at
tendance, Im not surprised that 
some tuition increases and the 
housing/dining increase were 
similar in percentage.
In addition to the cost of general 
operations next year, the increase 
will fund the planned Tartans 
Pavilion at Resnik (phase two of 
the Carnegie Mellon Caf) and 
the potential enlargement and 
relocation of Entropy.
In combined tuition, room, and 
board costs, next falls incom
ing first-year students will pay a 
total of $46,610. In comparison, 
current first-year students paid 
$43,458 overall for the 2006- 
2007 academic year, and current 
sophomores, juniors, and seniors 
paid $42,329. Next year, students 
in these groups will pay $45,240 
and $44,065, respectively.

JPL uses Carnegie Mellon software on Mars rovers
Courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech
NASAs Mars rover Opportunity is exploring Victoria Crater on Mars in search of evidence of past water. It analyzes the wavelengths of light emitted from the craters bedrock.
by Michael M. Whiston
Science & Technology Editor
NASAs Jet Propulsion Labora
tory (JPL) in California tested 
navigational software created 
by Carnegie Mellon University 
on the Mars rover Opportunity 
about two weeks ago. This new 
software enables the rover to 
maneuver around obstacles in 
search of past water on Mars.
In the summer of 2003, sci
entists at JPL sent two rovers, 
Opportunity and Spirit, to Mars 
as part of the Mars Exploration 
Rover Mission (MERM). MERM 
is a project that aims to find evi
dence of past water by studying 
bits of rock and soil on Mars.
Opportunity and Spirit are 
semi-autonomous rovers that 
have been operating on Mars 
since arriving there in Janu
ary 2004. Last month, scientists 
tested the new navigational 
software, called Field D-Star, on 
Opportunity.
Field D-Star is an upgraded 
version of the robots original 
navigational software. It allows 
the robot to create maps of its ter
rain and thereby avoid obstacles 
in its path.
Professor of robotics Anthony 
Stentz helped develop Field 
D- Star. He said that the rovers 
original software only allowed 
it to function in two modes: di
rected driving or auto-drive.
In directed driving mode, the 
rover moves blindly in a certain 
direction up to 50 meters based 
on pictures taken by the rover.
That is a relatively quick way 
to get around, but it requires that 
the path be safe, said Stentz.
In the auto-drive mode, the
rover moves short distances 
based on images taken by on
board cameras. If there were 
obstacles in the vehicles path, 
it was told, to maneuver around 
them.
Its good for avoiding isolated 
obstacles ... a single rock or hole 
... but its not the best strategy for 
more complicated obstructions 
like dead ends, Stentz said.
If the vehicle drove into a dead 
end, Stentz said, it turned the 
other way. But, it then turned 
back toward its destination, 
thereby running into the dead 
end again.
Carnegie Mellon alumnus
and JPL mobility engineer Mark 
Maimone helped create the ve
hicles original software. He said 
that the vehicles software some
times caused them to become 
stuck in a back-and-forth motion 
between rocks.
Maimone said that although 
Field D-Star uses the same out
put as his program, it improves 
the rovers ability to navigate 
around obstacles. During its first 
test run, Field D-Star successfully 
maneuvered Opportunity around 
a keep-out zone on Mars.
It takes the output of my 
system and is smarter about 
navigating through it, said 
Maimone.
Field D-Star, which was up
graded to both Opportunity
and Spirit, enables the rovers to 
create virtual maps of their en
vironment that determine their 
course.
It always plans the best path 
to the object point ... from the 
rovers current location taking 
into account everything that the 
rovers seen so far, said Stentz.
Stentz said that scientists on 
Earth do not have constant con
tact with the robot, and Field 
D- Star thus allows the robot to 
maneuver out of difficult situa
tions on its own.
When the robot reaches a dead 
end, for instance, it knows that it 
needs to turn around and drive
all the way out of the dead end.
This software has the poten
tial to steer the robot out of very 
complicated, maze-like environ
ments, said Stentz.
Maimone said that Opportu
nity is currently exploring an 
800-meter-wide crater called 
Victoria Crater. The vehicle ana
lyzes the bedrock surfaces of the 
craters cliffs and alcoves.
Bedrock contains layers of aged 
rock, providing researchers with 
a summary of the craters past.
Opportunity uses a spectrom
eter to analyze the different parts 
of the bedrock. A spectrometer 
is a device that measures wave
lengths of light to determine the 
bedrocks mineral and element 
composition.
According to a December JPL 
press release, Opportunity has 
collected over 80,700 images of 
its territory since the beginning 
of its mission.
They can see the true his
tory of what happened in order 
across millions of years, Maim
one said.
If scientists find salt in the 
bedrock, they know that water 
used to be present. Maimone said 
that the rover has already found 
evidence of past water in two cra
ters.
Within minutes of beginning 
the interview, Maimone received 
a message on his cell phone from
the Mars rover Opportunity. 
Maimone said that when the 
rover changes positions, it sends 
a message to his cell phone that 
contains images of its current lo
cation.
Over the course of three years, 
Opportunity has traveled about 
10 kilometers. Stentz said that 
Opportunity and Spirit move at a 
rate of one centimeter per second, 
and, for long stretches, they stay 
in one place.
The rovers computer is slow 
due to cold temperatures. In fact, 
the rovers computer has onehundredth the processing speed 
of a desktop computer.
Maimone said that field-testing 
was one of the most challenging 
parts of the project.
The hard part was ... testing 
it on Earth because the rovers are 
built for Mars, said Maimone.
He said that the cameras, for 
instance, overheat at a tempera
ture of 30C, ceasing to function 
in California by mid to late morn
ing.
Stentz said the team also faced 
the challenge of developing a 
program fast enough to construct 
terrain maps during the rovers 
operation.
The biggest challenge was 
to really come up with a com
putationally efficient algorithm 
for solving this problem, said 
Stentz.
Maimone said that Opportuni
tys crew of engineers faces the 
present challenge of maintaining 
the rovers three-year-old parts. 
In particular, Maimone said that 
the vehicles parts are beginning 
to wear out, and Opportunitys 
front right wheel does not steer.
Well have to see how to best 
take advantage of it, said Maim
one.
Nonetheless, the Mars rover 
Opportunity is already a recordsetting vehicle. According to 
JPLs website, Opportunity is the 
first robot to travel 10 kilometers 
on Mars.
Its been a stunning success 
for NASA, said Stentz. I hope 
that this is a capability that NASA 
will decide is beneficial for any 
rover on Mars.
Stentz said that he foresees 
NASA investigating how to best 
utilize the new programming sys
tem for its present purpose, and 
hopefully, for future missions.
Maimone said, Long-term, 
were going to keep driving these 
things until we dont hear from 
them anymore.

Hugging skeletons 
found at burial site
Archaeologists found a pair of 
prehistoric skeletons in Italy two 
weeks ago. Buried near the city 
of Verona, the main setting for 
Shakespeares play Romeo and 
Juliet, the two skeletons were 
found hugging one another.
The bones are more than 
5000 years old and are from the 
late Neolithic period. According 
to archaeologist Elena Menotti, 
who led the archaeological dig, 
these skeletons are a remarkable 
discovery because a Neolithic 
burial of two skeletons hugging 
one another has never been 
found.
Arrowheads and a knife were 
also found near the burial site, 
and archealogists are investigat

area. They hope to find other 
artifacts that could provide a 
better understanding of the

How Things Work: Mentos in Diet Coke
Michelle Bova
Scientists have performed an experi
ment involving Mentos and Diet Coke 
that takes the legend out of urban 
legend. The experiment was first per
formed for David Letterman by school 
teacher Lee Marek in 1999.
The experiment involves something 
that you can do with soda that will not 
rot your teeth, unless you decide to drink 
Diet Coke combined with Mentos candy. 
Unlike Pop Rocks and soda  which 
dont actually make your head explode if 
consumed together  combining Men
tos with Diet Coke really does cause a 
chemical reaction.
The result of combining Mentos with 
Diet Coke, which has been showcased 
around the Web thanks to YouTube, 
is not the typical fizz that arises from 
opening a new bottle of soda. Drop a 
T^entos candy into a two-liter bottle of 
any diet soda, and the soda will erupt like 
a geyser that puts all sixth-grade vinegarand baking soda projects to shame.
More recently, the experiment 
has been made popular by the cre
ators of the website EepyBird.com, 
which contains numerous videos of the 
Coke-Mentos explosions. In particular, 
EepyBird shows videos of synchronized 
Diet Coke geysers, domino fountains, 
and even bloopers.
The Mentos and Diet Coke experiment 
has also received national attention. It 
was featured on an episode of Discovery 
Channels Mythbusters and on National 
Public Radios nightly news show All 
Things Considered.
The science behind this experiment 
goes deeper than the surface.
Water molecules are strongly attracted 
to one another and will collect around a 
bubble of carbon dioxide that is found in 
the soda, forming a sort of coating.
For more carbon dioxide bubbles to 
form, or for existing ones to grow larger, 
they must break the surface tension of 
the water molecules.
The theory with Mentos is that the 
gum arabic in the candy breaks the sur
face tension of these molecules/making

Combining Mentos and Diet Coke causes a reaction that involves carbon dioxide bubbles.
the carbon dioxide bubbles form faster. the experiment really requires the use of 
While breaking the water molecules another property found in Mentos,
surface tension contributes to the reaction, The second property is the wealth of
tiny, irregular cracks and crevices that 
can be found all over a Mentos candy at a 
microscopic level, which are nucleation 
sites, or locations that are ripe for carbon 
dioxide bubbles to form. Drop a Mentos 
candy into the soda, and a large number 
of bubbles will form all over the candy at 
the nucleation sites. As the candy sinks, 
it passes through more soda and creates 
more bubbles. Collectively, these bubbles 
create foam and the pressure necessary 
to cause an eruption.
One might wonder why this experi
ment does not work with regular soda. 
According to Eepybirds scientists, drop
ping almost any object into any soda will 
create some fizzing, but usually less so 
than Mentos and Diet Coke.
In addition, Jamie Hyneman and 
Adam Savage, the hosts of Mythbusters, 
theorized that the sugar molecules in 
the soda, due to their size, prevent the 
fast formation of bubbles, and also that 
the sticky sugar can better contain car
bon dioxide bubbles. Other sites have 
suggested that diet soda is favored be
cause the cleanup is far less sticky than 
regular soda.
Mentos candies are convenient to use 
in the experiment because they are size
able, and they sink. But anything with 
gum acacia should do the trick. Hyne
man also said that table salt causes a 
similar eruption and actually works a 
little better than Mentos.
The ideal condition for achieving high
flying geysers is to get as many Mentos 
as possible into the diet soda at the same 
or nearly the same time. The scientists 
of EepyBird, for instance, drill a hole 
in each Mentos candy to make a string 
of Mentos that can be dropped into the 
soda. Of course, increasing the number 
of Mentos that are dropped will increase 
the spray.
Another way to increase the spray is 
by drilling a hole in the cap, holding the 
Mentos on a string, and then dropping 
them. The smaller hole creates a higher, 
more dramatic geyser.
Keep in mind, though, that it is prob
ably wise to do this experiment outside 
if you want to stay dry.
This software has the potential to steer the robot out 
of very complicated, maze-like environments.

Snow woes: Class continuation threatens safety
If you ever wondered what it would be 
like to slosh through the Dead Sea, you 
need only walk around Pittsburgh for a 
bit. The salt on the roads and sidewalks, 
a byproduct of the recent onslaught of 
winter weather, is turning pant legs ev
erywhere into crunchy litmus tests.
Yes, salt is the staple of winter weather 
safety, and Carnegie Mellon apparently 
has plenty of it. Any campus tour guide 
will tell you that the last time Carnegie 
Mellon had to cancel classes  and 
the only time in the preceding 10 years
 was when they ran out of salt in the 
2002-2003 school year. How this mar
keting tactic works is puzzling: Isnt 
half the fun of winter the snow days you 
get? Carnegie Mellons administration 
has a history of not canceling classes; 
legend has it that during the blizzard 
of 1993, the Governor of Pennsylvania 
called Carnegie Mellons president and 
threatened to send the National Guard 
to ensure the schools closure.
This semester has certainly been a 
whirlwind of winter weather, with over 
a week of continuous snow, followed by 
a week of negative temperatures, fol
lowed by snow and ice, followed by more
negative temperatures. Despite the fact 
that the temperatures, with windchill, 
were enough to cause frostbite on the 
walk to Scaife, professors and students 
soldiered on. Classes continued.
That was fine, but this past week the 
snow and ice came, and Civil Emer
gencies were declared in the state of 
Pennsylvania. Walking around campus 
was brutal: Sidewalks were unplowed 
and turning to brown, slippery slush, 
and the entrances to almost all of the 
buildings were slush marshes that even 
the most agile puddle-dodger couldnt 
dodge. Every Pittsburgh public school 
was closed, including the University of 
Pittsburgh, and some stores around the 
area were closing early, too. Classes con
tinued.
Then, Carnegie Mellon took action: 
The university cancelled the shuttle 
and escort services. An e-mail notifica
tion was sent to inform students that the 
services were being shut down for the 
night, and apparently we should have 
been glad that the school didnt want 
us to be put in the danger of fishtailing, spinning, and hydroplaning around 
Pittsburgh. But, classes continued.
Administration ignored a good portion 
of the safety issue  students walking 
to and from class from up Forbes, up 
Beeler, down Craig, across Fifth  by 
not cancelling classes. Students were 
still required to trek to uncancelled 
classes along busy roads, putting them 
in danger of getting hit by vehicles that 
clearly had no control. Night classes 
especially put students in dangerous po
sitions by requiring them to brave walks 
to and from campus amid the worsening 
road conditions and subjecting them to 
possible assault and robbery.
Thanks to night classes pressing on, 
many students discovered how to per
fectly steady themselves by grabbing 
onto the nearest stable object: a bench, 
a garbage can, a lamppost. It was easy 
to slip on sidewalks and roads, and even 
easier to fall onto the laptop hanging off 
our shoulders.
Carnegie Mellon, if youre going to 
cancel one service, make sure to can
cel everything that the service affects
 ensure our safety all the way. If its 
not about our safety, at least remember 
that wed enjoy a little snow break just 
like the rest of Pittsburgh did.
Relieve readme of its funding
It is outrageous that students at 
Carnegie Mellon are repeatedly sub
jected to the crassness that marks the 
pages of readme. Worse still is that we 
pay thousands of dollars for it, year 
after year. The Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC), the group of undergraduate and 
graduate students that allocates student 
funds each year, should think carefully 
about whether or not readme is a worthy 
steward of student funds.
readme was allocated $9066 of 
student money this year. Thats about 
one-and-a-half times what SPIRIT or the 
Womens Center each received, two-anda-half times what Dancers Symposium 
received, three times what SUMMIT 
or the Oakland Review each received, 
five times what ALLIES and cmuOUT 
each received, nine times what Amnesty 
International received... you get the 
idea. Out of 127 student organizations 
that received funding from JFC, readme 
took home more money than 103 of 
them. It doesnt make sense.
Over the past few years, readme has 
lost much of the quality humor it once 
had and now relies on tired stereotypes 
and vulgarity. The February 7-13 issue 
reached a new low. The issue leads with 
the article Student Senate Debates 
Sodomy Ban. A prominent graphic lets 
the reader know that, more specifically, 
sodomy among gay men is the focus of
the piece. The focus on and prejudice 
against gay men is further confirmed by 
the callous point-counterpoint, which 
features in large type the words: Stop 
being gay, Faggy Rogers. In this context, 
the lead article essentially compares a 
sexual practice of gay men to smok
ing cigarettes, a habit that is severely 
damaging to ones health and widely 
considered to be rather repugnant. The 
publication gives gay men cause to feel 
uneasy and unwelcome at Carnegie 
Mellon. The February 14 issue included 
yet another distasteful article mocking 
homosexual men. Such cold-heartedness is unacceptable.
Unfortunately, this is only one in a 
series of dramatically offensive articles 
and a continuum of tasteless trash  the 
New Hauschwitz article that made local 
news last semester is another obvious 
example. Over and over, the excuse has 
been that readmes staff has no nefari
ous intentions, that its members mean 
no harm  and that may be true. But 
that doesnt cut it. It is not enough for 
readmes staff to be personally comfort
able with the publications content. It 
is incumbent upon them to proactively 
avoid causing harm. The staff must be 
confident that content will not cause 
undue discomfort to others. Until the 
members of readmes staff accept this 
responsibility, they deserve no funding
from the student body.
Satire is one of the most powerful 
weapons in the arsenal of social critics. 
Properly crafted, satire serves to spur its 
audience to acknowledge, examine, and 
even change the wicked, hypocritical, 
and destructive ways of its society. But 
satire is also one of the hardest weapons 
to wield. Try as they may, past and cur
rent readme staffs have demonstrated 
that they cannot adequately navigate 
these treacherous waters, readme has 
failed time after time to deliver any 
real value to our community through 
its attempts at satire. Instead we are 
routinely subjected to the insensitive 
articles.
In the interest of full disclosure, in 
2004 former editors of The Tartan failed 
to prevent a disastrously botched attempt 
at satire from causing harm to our com
munity. Editors took responsibility, the 
organization stopped publishing for the 
rest of a school year, and we made sure 
it would never happen again. For years, 
readme has refused to do that. Its time 
for the JFC to do it for them.
AB can advertise its events in other, 
far more cost-effective ways. Students 
will be better off without being subjected 
to readmes demeaning material. And 
other, more worthy organizations will 
find themselves able to do, more with 
new funding. The choice is clear.

Americas torture fascination
Alexandra Kilduff
Since 24 started its sixth season in 
January, national buzz has descended 
upon the shows graphic an.d frequent 
portrayal of torture. Special Agent Jack 
Bauer sticks a knife in a guys thigh. 
Special Agent Jack Bauer breaks some 
fingers. If Special Agent Jack Bauer 
has a rough day, then he might end up 
on the wrong end of the interrogation 
table; on a good day he gets to bite the 
villain to death.
Whether you criticize or condone the 
shows treatment of torture, know that 
24 is not a trendsetter. On the small 
screen, 24 shares company with every
thing from The Sopranos (torture in New 
Jersey) to Battlestar Galactica (torture 
in space). John Hayes of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette wrote in January that no 
less than 13 movies currently showing 
in the Pittsburgh area featured scenes 
of torture. Letters from Iwo Jima may 
include scenes of torment as part of its 
unsparing portrayal of the realities of 
World War II; The Hitcher, where Sean 
Bean converts a semis trailer and cab 
into a torture rack on wheels, cannot 
make the same claim. Even the perpet
ually lucky James Bond cant escape. 
Casino Royale finds him naked, tied to a 
chair, with his enemies taking out their 
aggression on Jamess privates.
What would happen if we changed 
Jamess British accent to an Iraqi one 
and put a sack over his head?
Its a question that lurks, sometimes 
just out of sight, every time such a 
scene comes on the air. In politically 
charged shows like 24, the compari
sons between fiction and reality may 
be overt, but even in horror movies like 
Saw (so successful that its been made 
into a trilogy) and Hostel, its difficult 
to completely escape the human truth 
of torture. Torture, unlike most fic
tional death, is slow and degrading and 
very much intentional. Its one human 
deliberately putting another through 
excruciating pain and indignity for 
his own ends. You can sit ringside for a 
ticket price of $9.75.
In the past several years our national 
consciousness has been tuned into tor
ture and weve become aware of our 
own role in committing such acts. The 
words Abu Ghraib have become syn
onymous with national shame. So why 
did the infamous prisons exposure cor
respond with a sudden upswing in the 
entertainment industry for meat hooks, 
pliers, and amputated appendages? 
How can we condemn and consume 
simultaneously?
In his January article Films and TV 
up the ante on graphic torture scenes 
for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, John 
Hayes suggested that our willingness 
to watch fictionalized torture is a will
ingness to acknowledge our violent 
tendencies. I suspect that the reasons
are more calculated. The more torture 
Americans watch in the media, the more 
they can rationalize and normalize :it; 
the more they can normalize it, the less 
insidious it becomes when practicedr<in 
the real world. Jack Bauer, who often 
coerces his subjects in order to prevent 
imminent and catastrophic explosions, 
could then be seen as the norm rathqr 
than the outlier. r
When torture happens in the ral 
world, it is rarely to keep such immedi
ate disaster at bay. It is used to intimidate 
and dehumanize the enemy. And when 
we pay money to watch movies like Saw,' 
we participate in our own process of de
humanization. The victims of torture 
are no longer living, breathing people, 
but playthings. By thinking of them that 
way we make torture easier to swallow, 
and when we next see it on CNN or, in 
The New York Times, we can distance 
ourselves from it a little bit more.
Sometimes it takes an encounter 
with a real victim to realize how inher
ently flawed our acceptance of torture 
is. During my first year of college, I had 
the privilege to attend a small meeting 
with a former political prisoner from Af
rica. He had been an English teacher^on 
Africas west coast before being arrested 
by his countrys secret police. During bis 
imprisonment (he never received a tri^l) 
he was repeatedly tortured, but, to fri? 
recollection, never interrogated. Thgre 
was no purpose to the torture other tt$n 
the process itself. He was finally released 
and fled the continent, making his way 
to Washington, D.C., where he joined a 
support group for survivors of torture.
His story was harrowing without being 
particularly detailed. When it came time 
for questions, one girl couldnt withstand 
her curiosity. What kinds of torture 4id 
they put you through? she asked.
After a moment, he calmly began ,fo 
recount what the secret police had dope 
to him. Calmly and categorically, like 
he was reading instructions out of a 
handbook, he discussed water torture, 
electrical shocks, rubber hoses, and tire 
irons. Listening to him recount his ex
periences was probably nowhere near 
as painful for us as it was for him, but it 
was stunning just the same. It sounded 
as though it could have been fron^. 
film, but here was the man, standing 
front of us, still alive, with a face and a 
memory that was forever damaged by 
his captors.
Think about that the next time you 
head off to the movie theater for Saw IV 
or tune into 24. While youre watching 
Jack Bauer threaten his way to saving 
the country, a man is still struggling to 
put his life and faith together years af
ter being victimized. And while you^jt 
rapt in the movie theater, someone in 
world, someone with a face and a name 
and a life, is losing all of that to their tor
turers.

An alums vote for a Scottie dog mascot
Sounds as if the debate over choos
ing a mascot will be just as spirited as 
when the powers in Warner Hall de
hyphenated the universitys name a 
decade or so ago. Talk about your tem
pest in a typeset.
Anyway, I love all the verbal 
gazorching (Does that tradition live?) 
over what animal/vegetable/mineral/ 
robot is the right and proper symbol for 
our 107-year-old school. What better 
way to heat up a cold Pittsburgh win
ter?
Heres one old grads vote for the 
Scottish terrier. Ill tell you why.
The Scottie relates to the schools 
Scottish roots.
Unlike the highlander/piper, it
cannot be confused with Edinboro Uni
versitys fighting Scot.
The Scottie is gender neutral.
The Scottie has been unofficially 
used as a symbol by atheltic programs, 
since at least the 1920s. *r,
The Scottie can be drawn cartoony 
or fierce and be an effective mascot in 
either mood. . -Lit*
 CMU will sell far more merchandise 
bearing a Scottie than a man wearing a 
skirt. (Not that theres anything wrong 
with that.)
Anyway, I say - CHOOSE THE 
SCOTTIE!

Orientation and

campus unifiers

Orientation
This August, my younger 
sister visited Carnegie Mellon 
during first-year Orientation. 
After experiencing Orientation 
counselor training, she thought 
Carnegie Mellon was one of the 
most exciting schools shed ever 
visited. And since Im originally 
from California  home of UC 
Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, 
and UCLA  it was a pretty 
weighty statement on her part.
So what made my sister think 
we are the coolest school? The 
orientation counselor experi
ence. As an OC, youre surrounded 
by some of the most exciting, 
creative, warm, adventurous, 
and enthusiastic people on 
campus. Orientation Counselor 
training acts like a matchmaker
 getting students who all have 
similar vibes and interests in one 
place. Its pretty neat.
This week, we encourage you 
to try the OC experience for 
yourself. Orientation counselor 
applications are online at www. 
studentaffairs.cmu.edu/firstyear/orientation/counselor/ The 
application deadline is this Fri
day, February 23, 2007. Youll 
need to answer some basic ques
tions about yourself, explain 
your interests, provide peer and 
professional references, and 
submit a digital photo. All ap
plications should be mailed to 
Kaylie Thompson (khthomps@), 
who is the head orientation coun
selor in charge of staff selection 
and training.
Whether you want to work in 
a rambunctious first-year area or 
the more relaxed Oakland areas, 
theres an aspect of Orientation 
that appeals to everyone. So ap
ply! Plus, you know you want to 
go through Playfair again.
Student government: Get
involved!
Wed like to charge our readers 
with the goal of greater campus 
involvement. There are vacan
cies in Student Senate and its up 
to you to fill them. Student Sena
tors fund campus events, write 
campus policy, and improve stu
dent welfare. Better lighting in 
the Peace Garden and the printer 
in Donner are both the work of 
Student Senate. Senate can be a 
powerful place to get involved, 
and under the current chair, Joel 
Bergstein, its a fun and efficient 
way to get involved. Senate is do
ing some great things right now 
and we encourage you to step up 
and give back to your campus.
If you have questions about 
Student Senate, e-mail Lauren 
Hudock (lhudock@), the chair of 
Senates Communications Com
mittee.
And of course, if you have any 
ideas, concerns, complaints, 
or visions of campus change, 
come talk to us! E-mail sbp@ or 
sbvp@.

Theres not much to do where 
I live in a small suburb of Downingtown, Pa. With the exception 
of the occasional car accident or 
teacher strike, nothing exciting 
ever happens. I spend most of my 
time in Downingtown drinking 
imported beer and firing shot
guns off into my backyard late at 
night. Every now and then I hit 
something: a satellite dish, small 
animal, or housecat. But for the 
most part, the excitement comes 
from watching the beautiful blue 
and tirange flame jump out of 
the barrel, contrasted against a 
dark, cloudless night. But a guy 
like me  a liberal living in one 
of the wealthiest counties in the 
country  needed something 
more. I needed something that 
the public education system 
could not provide me with. I 
needed an ally.
Enter Hunter S. Thompson. 
I first read Fear and Loathing in 
Las Vegas as a 16-year-old, de
pressed and still complaining 
about a lack of female partners 
because of my acne. The politi
cal world had suddenly opened 
its skies to me, and it was raining 
drops of Freak Power. Thompson 
had come into my life and there 
was little chance that he would 
ever leave it. Suddenly, I had a 
sly smirk on my face during his
tory class. I knew more than the 
swine in charge did, and they 
didnt understand how. I knew 
America.
On February 20, 2005,1 was a 
senior in high school, trudging 
along the hallways and counting 
the days until I was free. Soon 
Id don the cheap blue and gold 
cap and gown and walk down 
the aisle at the 50-yard line of a 
sweaty football stadium in front 
of a sparse crowd of parents and 
grandparents. Soon Id have 
freedom from the oppression 
and tyranny of first-period study 
hall.
That afternoon, I arrived home 
three sheets to the wind from 
whiskey and a deep analysis of 
Camus The Stranger. The French
have a way of boggling my mind 
when it comes to literature. 
Something about existentialist 
thought, red wine, and tall metal 
towers frightens me. I flicked on 
the television and clicked past in
fomercials and soap operas about 
illegitimate children. I found my 
way to CNN and almost fainted 
in the middle of the living room.
HUNTER S. THOMPSON 
DEAD AT 67.
I didnt believe it was possible. I 
called my friend Greg on the tele
phone. Are you watching this? 
I shouted into the receiver.
He hadnt been, so I informed 
him that Thompson had shot 
himself. You mean the guy who 
wrote about drugs? he asked.
Scum! I shouted, and threw 
my phone across the floor. It 
snapped in half, the receiver 
landing somewhere behind the 
trash can. I have no tolerance 
for people who automatically 
associate Thompson with drug 
use. He was a man of excess, 
and that certainly involved mul
tiple experiences with incredibly 
dangerous chemicals, but it was 
about so much more! Thompson 
wrote about politics and greed 
and the idea of Freak Power: 
The idea that someone like him 
or like us could ultimately have 
control in a world gone mad. It 
was the idea that if all the freaks 
would band together, there was 
nothing that they couldnt ac
complish. It was about the Death 
of the American Dream, not 
something as petty and simple as 
cocaine and LSD.
I spent the rest of the after
noon in my room. I was pacing, 
chain-smoking, and doing push
ups. I was the portrait of Dick 
Cheney on speed, swearing in
cessantly and throwing lamps 
and clothing all around my room. 
How could it have happened? I 
wanted to romanticize the idea 
of Americas last great outlaw 
taking his own life when he saw 
it necessary. This only filled me 
with dread, so I fell asleep in the 
chair at my desk.
There is something about the 
way Thompsons writing grabbed
my attention that is impossible 
to articulate in words. He had an 
incredibly sharp, biting sense of 
humor that came across so clearly 
with the language he used in his 
descriptions. Thompson could 
make light out of a situation as 
horrifying as a murderous drug 
rampage or driving while intoxi
cated on the California freeway. 
He had such a strange ability to 
remain lovable and admirable 
while writing about unspeakable 
acts that were often shunned by 
society. We envied Hunter be
cause he embodied everything 
we wished we could be. He was 
the outlaw journalist.
Today, February 19, 2007, one 
day away from the two-year an
niversary of Hunters death, I 
still try and rationalize his pass
ing to myself. Many believe that
this was the right way for Hunter 
to leave. After all, he was the last 
outlaw this country knew and 
celebrated. He lived life faster 
than those around him and a 
quiet death would not have been 
appropriate for a man with his 
lifestyle and legacy. I catch myself 
wondering if there was anything 
left. I wonder whether or not he 
still had a few years of intelligent 
writing and social assessment 
in him, and I feel cheated by his 
early exit. But then I remember 
his understanding of the world 
around us and the keen observa
tions he made that everyone else 
seemed to ignore. I remember 
his brilliance and the fact that 
he could see aspects of human 
nature so well while others were 
blind to them. I remember all 
of these things and I realize: He
Ha Jin Choi/Art Staff
knew better than anybody else 
(God, Bog, whoever) when it was 
his time to leave. He knew this 
just like he knew the political 
system better than any journal
ist, Senator, or Congressman.
As British literary figure 
Samuel Johnson wrote, and 
Thompson quoted at the begin
ning of Fear and Loathing in Las 
Vegas, He who makes a beast 
of himself gets rid of the pain of 
being a man. Well, Good Doc
tor, this beast is numb, and its 
all thanks to you. Cheers, Dr. 
Hunter S. Thompson. The world 
will never know another who 
could match your genius.

Nielsen Ratings fail to accurately represent Americans preferences
Evan Sundwick
Until a little less than a month 
ago, you were completely and ut
terly insignificant in the eyes of 
one of the most powerful market 
research firms in the world. You
 the college student, the future 
of America  had absolutely no 
say in a cause that is, in all like
lihood, near and dear to your 
heart: television.
The Nielsen Ratings have been 
an established part of the TV 
industry for over four decades. 
The ratings, which are one of the 
only metrics determining which 
shows succeed and which fail, 
are computed in two ways. The 
first method is ratings diaries, 
which require people who have 
opted into the Nielsen program 
to record all of the TV they watch 
for a week. The other method the 
system uses is the set-top-box 
method: Participants have boxes 
installed on their televisions that
take note of who in the family 
is watching which shows. There 
are only about. 25,000 Nielsen 
boxes in the country, and the 
viewing diaries are distributed 
to about two million people over 
the course of a year.
Hold on a second: Nielsen Me
dia Research estimates there are 
about 110 million TV-equipped 
homes in the U.S. But Nielsen 
ratings only take into account 
1.8 percent of Americans TV 
preferences. Not even 2 percent 
of TV viewers have the power to 
dictate what shows get renewed 
and which get axed mid-season. 
Doesnt that seem unbalanced?
Anyone who has taken a sta
tistics class knows that you can 
never sample the whole popu
lation; thats why it is called a 
sample. Any good research will 
have a random sampling of a 
population, which stands in for 
the larger population. Ideally, 
the research will demonstrate 
external validity: The results 
can be generalized to the larger 
population.
The problem, in Nielsens case, 
is that the American population 
is anything but homogenous, 
especially with regard to TV 
viewing habits. When the 
Nielsen system was conceived in 
the 1960s, Americans watched 
television differently. There 
were only a few networks and 
television was more of a shared 
experience, with families gath
ering around the only TV in the 
house and probably watching the 
same shows as the family across 
the street. Random sampling of 
the population probably worked 
great back then; but the times, 
they are a-changin.
With th advent of cable and 
the wider adoption of televi
sion sets, individual networks 
often have personalities and 
target markets. A random sam
pling cant necessarily hit all 
the niches, and its not a binary 
choice. The people who watch 
Battlestar Galactica every Sun
day night would not be watching 
Desperate Housewives otherwise.
Until January 29 of this year,
Nielsen families with students at 
college did not record the view
ing habits of their children away 
from home. College students, of 
course, have far more free time 
than most other demographic 
groups, and Nielsen estimates 
they watch an average of 24 
hours of television every week. 
Only now have they realized that 
those 24 hours actually matter.
The best example of how the 
Nielsen system doesnt work was 
the cancellation and renewal of 
Family Guy. Fox cancelled the 
show after three seasons of poor 
ratings, only to realize its mis
take when DVDs of the show sold 
extraordinarily well. Oops.
Nielsen also recently decided 
to have viewer diaries include re
corded content when applicable. 
If a Nielsen family didnt have 
time to watch Lost on Wednes
day night, and instead watched 
it on TiVo over the weekend, Lost 
would no longer have a little gap 
in their ratings.
Still to be considered is on
line streaming. Many networks
allow their prime-time shows 
to be watched on the networks 
website via streaming videos 
and downloads. Apples iTunes 
Store sells thousands of tele
vision shows every week, and 
even more television shows are 
downloaded over peer-to-peer 
networks like BitTorrent. These 
viewers are watching a show, but 
if they dont have a Nielsen box, 
their vote doesnt count.
Admittedly, Nielsen Media Re
search is working on solutions 
to these problems, but every day 
they dont figure it out is another 
day that your voice as a college 
TV viewer goes unrepresented. 
And you are the one who feels 
the hammer fall when your 
favorite show gets cancelled. 
Heres hoping the future holds 
some answers.
Evan Sundwick (esundwic@.) is a 
professional writing and decision 
science major. He watches way too 
much TV, but hell be damned if 
Nielsens going to cancel another 
show he likes.
Valentine's Day is the holiday that everyone loves to hate, so we asked,

a9THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 19, 2007
Womens basketball loses pair of games to ranked teams
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon wom
ens basketball team squared 
off against two ranked Univer
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
teams this past weekend. The 
Tartans fell to the llth-ranked 
Washington (Mo.) University 
Bears 72-55 on Friday. They then 
took on the visiting 22nd-ranked 
University of Chicago Maroons 
on Sunday, coming up just short, 
65-56, in Skibo Gymnasium on 
senior day.
Against Wash. U. on Friday, the 
Tartans (8-16 overall, 2-11 in 
the UAA) opened up a 14-9 lead 
with 13:44 remaining in the first 
half before the Bears reeled off 13 
straight points to take an eightpoint lead. Wash. U. increased 
its lead to 11 before the Tartans 
made the last basket of the half. 
Sophomore forward Jeanette 
Schilling stole the ball, brought it 
up the court, and passed it to ju
nior forward Leah Feola who was 
able to lay the ball in, sending 
the Tartans into halftime trailing 
33-24.
The Bears built on their lead 
in the second half going up by as 
many as 26 points before Carn
egie Mellon ended the game on 
a 12-3 run highlighted by threepointers from first-year Paige 
Williamson and Feola.
Feola led the Tartans with 16 
points and seven rebounds. Soph
omore guard Stacie Aleski added
11 points, seven rebounds, and 
four assists in the loss.
Carnegie Mellon shot 33 per
cent from the floor compared to 
the Bears 46 percent. The Tar
tans committed 21 turnovers 
while the Bears turned the ball 
over 16 times.
In the first half on Sunday 
against Chicago, senior guard 
Ashley Mazziotta got the Tartans 
on the board with a lay-up and 
Aleski added a three-pointer to 
increase their lead to 5-1. The 
two teams played even basket
ball until the Tartans went cold 
from the field. Two Aleski free 
throws put Carnegie Mellon up 
28-24 with 7:39 remaining, but 
the Maroons proceeded to go on a 
12-1 run to go into halftime lead
ing 36-29. Aleski led the Tartans 
with 10 points in the half.
The Tartans hung with the 
Maroons for most of the second 
half despite being badly out-rebounded. However, they were 
never able to get over the hump 
and pull into the lead. A layup by
Feola at the 14:26 mark cut the 
deficit to three points at 42-39. 
Chicago answered with a pair of 
baskets and went on to increase 
its lead to 10. Carnegie Mellon 
trailed by only six at the 7:5 8 mark 
after a three-pointer by William
son, but Chicago answered with 
a four-point play. The two teams 
played even basketball after that 
point, with the Maroons winning 
by nine.
We played hard, Aleski said. 
We were really excited for this 
game, especially senior night and 
everything. Chicagos a tough 
team and'we thought we could 
take them. We hung in there, and 
were only down seven at half time. 
It seems like every game theres 
two or three possessions down 
the floor where we just arent able 
to finish and then the other team 
comes down and scores and we 
can never make up that gap.
Aleski led the Tartans with 14 
points and four assists. Mazziotta 
added a season-high 12 points 
and Feola contributed 10 points 
and a team-high six rebounds. 
The Maroons out-rebounded 
the Tartans 55-27 and shot 42 
percent for the game while the 
Tartans finished the game shoot
ing 33 percent.
The seniors [Mazziotta and
Nora Darcher] are awesome, 
Aleski said. Theyre wonder
ful leaders on and off the floor. 
Theyve always been there for 
us for anything that weve ever 
needed.
The Tartans will finish up their
season on Saturday when they 
travel to play the University of 
Rochester.
Our goal next Saturday is to 
keep playing with them and hope
fully come out with a W,Aleski 
said.

MENS, from A10
hit back-to-back three-pointers 
later to bring their lead back up to 
12, at 69-57 at the 5:59 mark. A 
layup by Anderson with 2:55 re
maining cut the Maroons lead to 
74-70. After a Chicago miss, the 
Tartans came down on the fast 
break only to have sophomore 
guard Corey ORourke pick up a 
charging foul. Chicago made a 
basket at the other end and con
nected on its free throws the rest 
of the way to seal the hard-earned 
victory.
Kozak scored a career-high 20 
points on 9-13 shooting from the 
floor. Einwag also had 20 points 
to go with his team-high eight 
rebounds. Matta, playing in his fi
nal home game, added 15 points.
It was senior day and we were 
able to get motivated for Brad, 
Kozak said. We ended the first 
half down eight, and we had 
some mental breakdowns, but we 
played some of our best basket
ball of the season in the second 
half. This is a good note as we go 
into the Rochester game next Sat
urday.
The Tartans will wrap up their 
regular season on Saturday when 
they travel to play the University 
of Rochester.
Its always difficult to play at 
Rochester, said Kozak, but we 
hope to play as well as we did in 
the second half [against Chicago] 
and end the year over .500, thatd 
be great.

Sophomore guard Corey ORourke (#21) goes up for a layup during Fridays 
game.
Aio THE TARTAN February 19, 2007
Tartan mens basketball drops two games to top UAA teams
other end. The Bears extended 
their lead thanks to strong free 
throw shooting as they went on 
to win by 21.
Anderson came off the bench 
to lead the Tartans with 13 
points and six rebounds. Ko
zak contributed 12 points and 
five assists, and Einwag added 
11 points. Bouldin-Johnson 
chipped in nine points and five 
rebounds off the bench.
Friday we had a huge crowd 
for White-Out Night, Kozak 
said. Friday night home games 
are always fun to play in, and 
the fans were great. In the first 
half we played even, up two, 
down two, and then in the last 
minute they go on a run. Things 
like that take the wind out of 
your sails. Its hard to come 
back against the llth-ranked 
team in the country, we came 
out a little sluggish in the sec
ond half and Wash. U. pulled 
away.
During the first half on 
Sunday, both teams started out 
cold from the floor, but Einwag 
was able to create opportuni
ties for himself, and his dribble 
penetration led to a layup giv
ing the Tartans the lead at 9-8 
with 14:54 remaining.
Chicago went on a small run 
before a three-pointer by Ko
zak cut the Maroons lead to 
22-20.
Over the ensuing two min
utes, Chicago used a 10-0 tun 
to increase its lead to double 
digits.
With 3:03 remaining, the Tar
tans found themselves down by 
14 before scoring the final six 
points of the first half to go into 
the break down 39-31.
The Maroons were in a posi
tion to blow the game wide open 
early in the second half, but the 
Tartans came storming back. A 
13-2 run for Carnegie Mellon 
capped off by a free throw from 
Einwag narrowed the score to 
52-50 with 12:24 left. Chicago

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team took on the 
top two teams in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) over 
the weekend in the confines of 
Skibo Gymnasium, losing to 
the llth-ranked Washington 
(Mo.) University Bears on Fri
day 94-73 and nearly pulling 
off an upset of the 14th-ranked 
University of Chicago Maroons 
on Sunday before falling 82-75. 
The losses move the Tartans to 
12-11 overall and 5-8 in the 
UAA.
Against Wash. U. on Friday, 
an exciting first half saw the 
lead exchange hands eight 
times before the Bears scored 
the final eight points to lead 
45-38 at the break. Junior 
guard Geoff Kozak got the Tar
tans on the board with a pair 
of early three-pointers, and 
first-year guard Jack Anderson 
followed suit with back-to-back 
treys, putting Carnegie Mellon 
up 16-12 at the 12:23 mark.
Wash. U. then retook the lead 
until senior guard Brad Matta 
knocked down a jumper in the 
lane at the 4:25 mark, putting 
the Tartans up 30-29. A layup 
by sophomore forward Ter
rance Bouldin-Johnson gave 
the Tartans the lead again at 
38-37, but the Bears responded 
with an 8-0 run to go into halftime up by seven.
Wash. U. continued its lightsout shooting in the second half 
as the team methodically in
creased their advantage over 
the Tartans. Two free throws 
by sophomore forward Ryan 
Einwag cut the Bears lead to 
47-42 with 18:19 remaining. 
Wash. U. then used a 16-5 run 
over the ensuing five minutes 
to lead by 16.
The Tartans cut the lead to 10 
on an Einwag layup at the 9:49 
mark, but Wash. U. answered 
with a three-point play on the
Track and field teams compete at Kent State
by Sam Kim
Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon track 
and field teams returned to action to compete 
at the Kent State Tune-Up. Both teams saw 
several individual bests, but the highlight of 
the meet was when senior Nicholas Bannister 
set a new school record in the mens 55-meter 
hurdles with a time of 7.75. He placed sixth 
overall in the race.
Also for the men, first-year Chris Bogie took 
third place in the 300-meter hurdles with 
a time of 40.20. Behind Bogie, senior Jeff 
Polack (41.46) and sophomore Craig Hahn 
(42.20) took 10th and 12th, respectively.
In the mens distance events, sophomore 
Brian Harvey (8:28.42) nearly set a school 
record in the 3000-meter run, finishing third 
overall. Fellow sophomore Raphael Bertrand 
(2:43.37) also had a strong day, finishing
ninth in the 1000-meter run. In the 5000- 
meter run, sophomore Breck Fresen finished 
12th with a time of 15:39.71. First-year Dario 
Donatelli (15:45.74) and sophomore Andrew 
Frederickson (15:48:03) finished 15th and 
17th, respectively.
Junior Drew Miller (4:23.21) and senior 
Geoff Misek (4:23.35) finished 18th and 20th, 
respectively, in the one-mile run.
Senior Davey Quinn (1:55.34) placed third 
in the 800-meter run, while junior Kiley Wil
liams (50.61) finished 14th in the 400-meter 
dash.
For the Tartan men, four jumpers finished 
the triple jump in the top 15. Senior Eric Tang 
(13.08 meters) led the team with an eighthplace finish. Sophomores Colin Marks (13.03 
meters) and Joel Palko (12.83 meters) fol
lowed to finish ninth and 11th, respectively. 
First-year Eric Couphos came in 13th with a 
12.73-meter jump.
In the long jump, Tang (6.13 meters) led the
team again with a 17th-place finish.
My performance today was not too great, 
Tang said. Im expecting to win UAAs. We 
came in second last year, and I feel like our 
team is a lot stronger this time around. 
Junior Michael Reggie threw for 14.53 me
ters in the weight throw to finish 19th. The 
mens 4x400-meter relay team had a strong 
run and took fifth with a time of 3:24.04.
On the womens side, junior Shauna Ormon 
(1:01.89) almost set a school record in the 
400-meter dash, finishing 22nd overall. In 
the 600-meter run, first-year Diane Mattingly 
(1:46.04) took seventh place, while senior 
Amber Fuller (1:46.04) finished right behind 
Mattingly for ninth place.
Were all in good shape and weve been 
training all fall and winter for the [UAAs]. So 
hopefully we all perform our best and get the 
times, said sprinter Jacki Andreozzi.

After six months of training 
and games, the mens basketball 
teams season is finally winding 
down. The team has had one 
of its better seasons, currently 
with a 12-11 record with one 
more game to play. Last week, 
The Tartan sat down with se
nior guard and co-captain Brad 
Matta, to talk about the Tartans 
season, and where hes headed 
after Carnegie Mellon.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing basketball and why?
Matta: I started playing in 
about second grade pretty much 
just because my mom went out 
and signed me up for a whole 
bunch of sports. I tried wres
tling in like, third grade, and 
when I found out it was noth
ing like the WWF, I quit. Its the 
only sport Ive quit. I was so dis
appointed.
T: Was basketball part of your 
decision to come to Carnegie 
Mellon?
M: Yes.'I wanted to play bas
ketball no matter where I went, 
and when I lined up the schools 
I was looking at, Carnegie Mel
lon just stood out as the best.
T: Other than basketball, do 
you have any hobbies?
M: Well I love the HBO series 
The Sopranos, so I watch that a 
lot, and then Im really inter
ested in politics, on both the 
lo<al and national levels.
T: Do you have a favorite place 
that youve gotten to travel to 
for basketball?
M: I dont really have a fa
vorite place so much as favorite 
memories. Like over Christmas 
one year, we played Princeton 
and won, and we went out to 
eat at some restaurant after, 
and everyone there asked us 
who we played, and when we 
told them we beat Princeton, 
everyone started cheering for 
us, because apparently they all 
hate Princeton kids.
T: The season is almost over; 
have you particularly enjoyed 
the season? Do you have any 
goals for these last few games?
M: Ive really enjoyed playing 
basketball the past few years 
in general; weve really accom
plished a lot and its something 
Im proud of. As for goals, not 
too much in particular; it hit me 
during the NYU game that my 
basketball career is almost over, 
so I really just want to make the 
most of these last few practices 
and games.
T: So is there anything sur
prising people wouldnt really
know about you that you can let 
slip out?
M: I love listening to techno 
music to get pumped up, and I 
will sing pretty much any song 
made in th 1980s.
I pretty much have the worst 
voic* at Carnegie Mellon. 
Sweet Caroline by Neil Dia
mond is probably my favorite 
song ever.
T: Do you have any opinion 
on what the schools new mas
cot should be?
M: I would like to see it be a 
replica of Andrew Carnegie.. 
Something like the University 
of Massachusetts Minute Men
 just a giant foam head of 
'Andrew Carnegie with a little 
body, running around.
T: Have you figured out any of 
your plans for after graduation 
yet?
M: Yes. After graduating, I 
want to go to law school; I just 
havent picked exactly which 
one yet.

After competing at the. 
University Athletic Association 
Championships last week, the 
Carnegie Mellon swimming and 
diving teams traveled to Kenyon 
College last weekend to com
pete at the Kenyon Swimming 
Invitational. At the Saturday af
ternoon meet, the Tartans faced

relay, the Carnegie Mellon A 
team, consisting of juniors Patlay, the Tartans A team took

of sophomores Ryan Piper, Brad 
Henderson, Krzeminski, and 
Snyder. The B team consisted of 
LoPresti, Hofler, Altman-Kurosaki, and Winkler.
The Carnegie Mellon B team 
of Hofler, Winkler, Tinari, and 
Coyle also took fourth in the 
mens 400-yard freestyle relay.
First-year Andrew Weitz 
placed second in the 400-yard 
IM with a time of 4:08.40. Ju
nior Andy Douglass took second

Kochalko won the 200-yard but
terfly with a time of 2:09.00. 
Her time was a personal record, 
a Carnegie Mellon record, and 
good enough for the NCAA B 
cut. Fellow junior Lauren Con
nell took third in the 100-yard 
freestyle with a time of 53.67.
The Kenyon meet wasnt as 
much of a team meet as it was for 
individuals who wanted to lower 
or make their NCAA cuts, Con
nell said. All of th boys who 
had this as their championship 
meet swam amazingly. Its re
ally tough to squeeze a three-day 
meet into one long six-hour ses
sion, and they handled it really 
well.
The Tartans will head to na
tionals, which will be held at the 
University of Houston, in early 
March. The women will compete 
Thursday, March'8, through Sat
urday, March 10, while the men 
will race Thursday, March 15, 
through Saturday, March 17.

Rare Sondheim musical hops into Pittsburgh Everything you need to know
In The Frogs: The time is the present. The place is ancient Greece. About break ups, and break outs
The Frogs opened in Yale University's swimming 
pool in 1974, starring then-unknowns Meryl Streep 
and Sigourney Weaver, plus a raft of undergraduate 
swimmers in jockstraps and green mesh. The 
Pittsburgh premiere at Point Park University on 
Valentines Day was much drier, but only slightly 
less absurd.
Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shelove  the 
pair that created A Funny Thing Happened on 
the Way to the Forum  adapted The Frogs 
from Aristophanes play of the same name. Like 
Forum, The Frogs updates ancient material with a 
barrage of anachronistic jokes, brilliant numbers, 
and a touch of social commentary. Aristophanes' 
play follows Dionysus, god of the theater, who, 
exhausted by war and frustrated with bad theater, 
decides to fetch Euripides back from Hades. The 
musical replaces Euripides with George Bernard 
Shaw and alters the plot to reflect frustrations with 
current political leaders.
Point Parks version begins with Dionysus 
(Dale Spollett) and his slave Xanthias (Jordan 
Grubb) laying down rules for the audience in a 
portion called Invocation and Instructions to the 
Audience," which includes admonitions not to hum 
along, unwrap candies, fart, eat, cough, or leave 
early. Spollett, utterly convincing as the bon vivant 
Dionysus, explains, "The time is the present. The 
place is ancient Greece.
While feeling a war-torn Athens, Dionysus and 
Xanthias note their leaders incompetence: "Words 
seem to fail our leaders  even simple words." The 
audience howled in appreciation, and the two head 
off to see Herakles, who can help them find the way 
to hell. Lugging Dionysus extra togas and Shaw's 
complete works, Xanthias complains about his lot in 
I Love to Travel. Grubb seems an unlikely ancient 
Greek  but a great comic sidekick and everyman 
character.
Donning a lionskin headdress, fur loincloth, and 
drawn-on six-pack, Herakles (Thomas Sullivan) 
dominates the stage. The hero decides that
Dionysus cant survive in Hades unless he 
impersonates a more powerful god, so he gives 
Dionysus a quick lesson in striking fear into mortals 
hearts and lets him borrow his spare lionskin and 
club. Dionysus sets off for Hades with the reluctant 
Xanthias in tow.
The disguised Dionysus starts across the river Styx 
in a boat rowed by gatekeeper and pothead Charon 
(Kevin Doyle). Halfway to Hades, Dionysus is beset 
by a swarm of huge frogs, as bouncy as Hgger, but 
ten times creepier. The frogs represent the status 
quo  they want to prevent Dionysus from bringing 
back Shaw and changing history. Buf. Dionysus 
escapes the frogs and steps onto the shores of 
Hades, shaken and covered in seaweed.
After a few misadventures and an encounter with 
Pluto (played flamboyantly but unimpressively by 
Adam Chisnall) the two Greeks find Shaw and are 
set to head back when Dionysus spots Shakespeare. 
Torn between the two geniuses, Dionysus decides 
to pit them against each other in the ultimate 
verbal battle. After the two playwrights face 
off, quoting the subjects of life, love, and death, 
Dionysus realizes that despite Shaws brilliance, 
the world will respond to Shakespeares idealistic 
poetry better than Shaw's dark truths. Dionysus 
and Shakespeare head upwards, leaving Xanthias 
behind as collateral. The play ends with the 
somewhat sobering Final Instructions, begging 
the audience not to be apathetic like the frogs, to 
get out and change the world.
Point Park's production was brilliantly performed, 
costumed, sung, and orchestrated. The play is 
alternately hilarious, serious, political, silly, and 
thought-provoking. Its showing until next Sunday, 
so hurry  hop on over to the Pittsburgh Playhouse 
before it's gone.

Dear Janet,
I have a friend whos going 
through a breakup. But there 
is a problem. She seems really 
caught up in it and its a lot of 
what I talk about with her. How 
can I forcefully say that while I 
feel her pain, I dont think shes 
benefiting from dwelling on it? 
I dont know how to say that 
without seeming to be saying 
STFU because truthfully I want 
to support her. Shes definitely 
the type of person who dwells 
on things rather than moving on 
to the next big deal.
Thanks, Painful Aftermath of 
Love
Dear PAL,
Thats a tough tightrope to walk
 you want to be supportive of 
your friend, but after a while you 
get so sick of hearing the same 
thing over and over that you just 
want to tell her to get a grip. In my 
experience, the best way to get 
out of a situation like this is to push 
your friend toward new experiences 
and moving on  toward concrete 
action. If shes complaining about 
something that happened, help her 
figure out something to do or say. 
Also, always take a hard stance on 
self-pitying statements. If she ever 
pulls out the Ill be alone forever, 
nobody will ever love me again 
card, point out to her both the 
absurd falseness of that statement 
and the fact that shes a beautiful, 
strong woman who doesnt need a 
stupid boy.
Janet
Did you know?
Dear Janet,
I hooked up with a girl I just 
met at a party. We spent the 
night together and didnt get 
much sleep, if you know what I 
mean. We were just so into each 
other that we didnt use any 
protection. She looked clean, so 
Im not worried about catching 
anything. My question, though, 
is how do I tell her that my 
herpes was starting to flare up?
Itching to Know
Dear ITK,
Though I know your question is 
probably a joke, Im going to answer 
it anyway because its a valid issue. 
Unfortunately, anytime you hook up 
with somebody you need to have 
that uncomfortable talk with them 
about sexual health and whether 
they've been tested recently. At 
some point after it gets hot and 
heavy, but before the clothes come 
off, you have to ask, and if you do 
have a sexual health issue (like you, 
ITK) you have to say something 
about it to your partner. If there is 
an STD in the mix, there are still 
safe ways to screw around without 
infecting your partner; you just have 
to make a little more effort to be 
safe. If you care about the person 
enough to sleep with them, you 
should care enough to talk to them 
about this, however uncomfortable 
or mood-altering it might be.

The H&SS job fair began with a significant change: 
barely anyone showed up. Wiegand Gym looked 
more like a ghost town than a recruiting event; 
empty booths were coupled with a surprisingly 
low number of H&SS job-seekers. Compared to 
the recent BOC, its hard to believe that so few 
students cared about their futures. Then again, its 
also strangely pleasing to know that there was a 
time when students werent internship lunatics.

PLAYGROUND showcases student-produced works
The School of Dramas strictly structured program, although 
effective, affords little time for its students to create their own 
theatrical productions. It was in response to this need that 
Elizabeth Bradley, director of the School of Drama, worked 
with her staff to create PLAYGROUND four years ago.
"PLAYGROUND is an opportunity for students to create 
performance or participatory experiences," said Bradley. It is, 
in theory, something that allows students to deeply express 
their own interests and creativity. It is very personal and 
honest.
PLAYGROUND is an annual event that takes place over the 
period of a week, during which students from the School 
of Drama may explore experimental ideas, create original 
works, and enlist the aid of others to create cooperative, 
interdisciplinary groups to work on various projects. The 
event is a major break from the curriculum.
PLAYGROUND pieces have a 45-minute time limit, and no 
faculty members may participate unless directly invited to do 
so by a student. No awards are given to the pieces, so that 
the weeks creative spirit is not undermined by competition. 
There is no budget; the students must create or personally 
produce all props, platforms, sets, ideas, and performances. 
Moreover, there is a time constraint: the production process 
may not begin until the week of PLAYGROUND.
"We wanted to demonstrate that we also fostered and valued 
impulses for innovation," said Bradley. [We wanted] to 
highlight the students interests and be experimental, allow 
them to take self-devised work and own it in a particular 
way."
Life Out of Balance
Life Out of Balance was the product of Lydia Fine and Molly 
McCurdy, two first-year design majors in the drama program. 
It was a walk-through piece with dim, blue lighting, the play 
capturing the typical rush of daily life in the city. The buildup 
was singularly affecting, including frantic repetitions of 
numbers, calls for order placements, and appointments 
made and missed. Actors barked their lines and made sharp 
movements in staccato rhythm, accentuating the singlemindedness of their devotion to their capitalist-based jobs.
There were five separate stations in which various, 
heightened scenarios were given: about making 
appointments, feeling frantic about a missing order, and other 
related avenues of capitalist activity. Each station gave out 
papers with facts about waste such as, North Americans 
throw away 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour." The title 
of the piece matched the acting, but the acting did not have 
a very clear connection to the garbage facts. The point could 
have been better brought to light.
The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter
Translated from Hebrew to English from the original play by 
Nissim Aloni, the surrealistic The Bride and the Butterfly 
Hunter debuted by first-year directing major Gahl Pratt. Set 
in a garden (complete with classical background music), the 
play contained two characters: a once-a-week almost-butterfly 
hunter, and a bride whose groom seems to have gone AWOL. 
Watching the pair interact created a strange dynamic in 
which reality was distorted and the concepts of freedom, 
personal desires, and general discontent pulsated.
The best kinds of stories are those that contain the potential 
for multiple interpretations, and this was precisely of that 
kind. It was a piece in which resonating human yearning 
and social conventions filled in as the protagonist of the 
buried, extended metaphor of the play. Bride also seemed to 
have vague allusions to more political situations including 
the situation in Israel, but the abstraction was difficult to 
reconcile with reality.
Falling Into Place
Falling Into Place was a more musical piece, performed by a 
handful of first-year musical theater majors. The sung pieces 
were all written and accompanied by Sean Pallatroni, a firstyear at the University of Hartford's Hartt School of Music, and 
primarily addressed relationships and the struggle to figure 
out the metaphorical next step" in life. Topics of indecision 
included murder, divorce, heartbreak, reconciliation, and 
wonderment at the nature of love. Though there were 
especially strong performances by Skye Scott and Sophia 
Feldman, with the exception of two or three songs, the music 
mostly consisted of variations of the same melody. Though 
the songs sounded similar, the sounds of the voices gave new
texture to the feelings evoked by the songs. The-melding of 
these contrasting voices brought decisive closure during the 
finale through the use of a multi-part suspension (when only 
some vocalists shift chords).
A Heart Full of Milk or The Tale of the Captive Muse
The most absurdly entertaining play during PLAYGROUND 
was A Heart Full of Milk or The Tale of the Captive Muse, 
by Sam Trussell, a sophomore acting major in the School of. 
Drama. Wickedly funny, the play was read from the script 
with a somewhat-improvised cast after the lead actor fell ill. 
The recasting and slight troubles with props (in which the 
audience was required to use their imagination" for certain 
objects, like abacuses and raccoons) did little to detract from 
the play.
The naivete of a 25-year-old child, the repressiveness of an 
overly doting, psychotic mother, and the mysterious 
Closet-Man combined forces to create an off-beat, hilarious, 
and wild production. The material was fresh and original, 
with funny lines regarding misconceptions about skin 
pigmentation (a satirical reflection of racism). Pigmentation 
equals sin, said Mother fondly to her son, Sylvester. There 
was rich imagery, which included dreams about moons 
and suns. The delivery was not free of faults but the actors 
handled the imperfections well; they either created the 
illusion that the mistakes were intended or used them to curry 
more favor from the audience.
Tickets to all PLAYGROUND pieces were free, and schools 
outside of the School of Drama are encouraged to view not 
only PLAYGROUND shows but also those put in production 
throughout the school year. Some PLAYGROUND pieces 
have traveled outside of Purnell and have been reproduced 
and performed in other places. Life in Plastic, a piece about 
women and their idealized roles throughout American history, 
was performed in New York City, while The Salesman, a salute 
to American silent films, was reproduced in Los Angeles. The 
question remains  what else will go, and.where?

Harlem jazz hits Pittsburgh
Local musicians perform at the Shadow LoungeOn rock star deaths
The Shadow Lounge jived last Friday night with the 
jazz and R&B stylings of Carolyn Perteete and Eviction 
Notice, two local acts. Advertised as "a jazz 
extravaganza and cocktail party," the event drew a 
crowd of well-dressed students from local colleges and 
music lovers from the community. It was hosted by 
the Black Business Association of the Carnegie Mellon 
Tepper School of Business in celebration of Black 
History Month.
Carolyn Perteete, a Pittsburgh singer/songwriter whose 
style of jazz is infused with R&B, provided a mellowing 
musical backdrop for the lounge ambience. Although 
her voice was too 
flat for pop music,
Perteete seemed 
comfortable with 
the support of her 
rhyhtm section, 
featuring guitar, 
drums, and 
acoustic bass.
She has more of 
a neo-soul jazz 
voice, but [her 
sound is] far from 
mainstream.
It's more of 
an alternative 
R&B, observed 
Adam Wright,
a senior business major who attended the show. [Her 
style] has a lot more R&B sound, more contemporary 
and different, but still has a lot of the jazz aspects.
As part of a music class, Wright had seen Perteete 
perform previously at the Afro-American Music 
Institute, which specializes in instrumental and vocal 
training in all styles of the African-American music 
tradition. "You want to fall in love with her every time 
you watch her sing," Wright said.
Following Perteete was Eviction Notice, a group who 
draws strongly from hip-hop beats. Also native to 
Pittsburgh, Eviction Notice provided an eclectic mix 
of soul, R&B, hip-hop, and jazz with an occasional 
funk groove. In addition to playing some original 
compositions, Eviction Notice sampled songs from 
a number of different genres, interpreting each in a 
unique style. The transitions from one sample to another 
were smooth.
The Shadow Lounge, now in its sixth year of operation, 
exhibits an urban, cultural cool. Located in East Liberty, 
by Baum Boulevard and South Highland Avenue, the 
club may be a bit out of the way for most Carnegie 
Mellon students, though its worth the trip for its 
authentic lounge atmosphere. Warm-colored walls flow 
into darkly covered couches as the music reverberates 
around the room. The Shadow Lounge, however, is not 
a party venue. It boasts many cultural events, ranging 
from hip-hop and jazz performances to poetry jams.
Although the event was advertised as a celebration 
of the Harlem Renaissance, the contemporary jazz of
Perteete and 
Eviction Notice 
is far removed 
from the 19203- 
era performers. 
Still, the event 
was certainly 
relevant to black 
history. Jazz 
music heralds 
the history of 
Harlem. Our 
bands performed 
classic jazz and 
new-age jazz 
mixed with 
hip-hop," stated 
Sola M. Talabi, 
president of the
Black Business Association, in an e-mail. Music is an 
integral part of black culture, and hence we felt a need 
to integrate historical black music into our events for 
Black History Month.
The main idea behind the Harlem Renaissance was the 
flourishing of African-American culture," Wright said. 
"The styles change but they retain their roots."
Perteete and Eviction Notice prove that innovative 
jazz-inspired music has roots in the Pittsburgh music 
scene with a solid home at the Shadow Lounge. Their 
contemporary styles offer a euphonic blend of genres 
that should at least make the Harlem masters smile on 
the inside  even if they shout to turn off the ruckus.

Alex Wright
I never thought that Jesus had much to do with rock and roll, but 
according to some, the Good Shepherd intervenes regularly to cut 
short the sinful lives of some of our best-known and best-loved 
musical celebrities. Dial-the-Truth Ministries has compiled a list 
of dead rock stars at www.av1611 .org/rockdead.html. The site 
tracks some 300 rock-star deaths, attributing about half to high-risk 
behavior like drug use and the remainder to natural causes like heart 
attacks and leukemia.
The implication is that while some rock stars kill themselves with their 
lifestyles, many others are struck down by God. According to the 
site, rock stars live half as long as regular citizens. Preachers have 
long told us that listening to rock music is playing with fire; this study 
claims that performing it is stepping directly into the flames.
Even outside of art, early death plays a huge role in Western society. 
Christianity sticks in our memories in part because of its own early 
deaths: Jesus ascended into heaven at 33, a full 3.9 years sooner 
than the average Dial-the-Truth rock star, Sure, there was a vast 
increase in life expectancy over the millennia  but was it not Jesus 
own lifestyle and celebrity status that brought him before Pontius 
Pilate?
Of course, there are differences between rock stars and Jesus.
I mean only to point out the cultural significance of the demise; 
how we take an early, unexpected death, and remember it. We try 
to ascribe the death to cause and effect, try to find reasons why 
someone died before he or she should have. But coping with an 
untimely death is different than using it to send a moral message.
A person's life ought to be more than a political or evangelical tool, 
and those who manipulate the lives of the departed demean both 
themselves and their faiths. If we were to reduce Jesus' life to its 
end, all we would have is a warning against bucking the system, not 
the rich and diverse set of teachings conveyed through the rest of 
His life.
Those who believe that rock music is an inherently evil force do not 
understand that rock music is simply a mode of expression. Just as 
language can be used both to denounce the Holy Spirit and praise 
the Lord, electric guitars and robust bass lines can be used for good, 
evil, or neither. Both religion and music can celebrate what makes 
us human, albeit in different ways. Rock music at its best articulates 
what it means to be alive, and in its own way can help us extend 
beyond our raw animal selves into the world of the mind and spirit.

Lunar Gala goes Vice Versa
A models perspective
I was backstage with the models, eight hours before the show 
began. Lunar Gala girls and boys scurried around for outfit 
changes  it was the last practice before the distinctively 
diverse show. "I wanted to get involved in something 
creative," said Alissa Micciulla, a sophomore self-defined 
major, while donning some lacy netted number.
Micciulla was among other laughing models, some frantically 
changing, others sitting and waiting for their scenes. They 
all agreed that the fashion show was a heavy commitment. 
Rachelle Emard, a junior in the Department of Social and 
Decision Sciences, concurred. "Its been time consuming.
But I think I learned a lot, she said. She explained that the 
models comfort zones and confidence levels were pushed  
but that it was a good thing. "It's very fun still, she insisted. 
Despite the complaints, she added, the models must like the 
show enough to stick with it.
Lunar Gala 2007 was themed Vice Versa. Each of the 13 
designers interpreted the theme differently. Lunar Gala was 
created 11 years ago to commemorate the Chinese Lunar 
New Year through creative means; that is, fashion and 
entertainment. Since then, it has grown into one of the most 
celebrated events on campus, completely run by students. 
This year's rendition praised the year of the golden pig, which 
brings good luck and prosperity.
Seven hours before the show, senior biological sciences 
major Justin Van Denend predicted that the audience would 
respond with "catcalls and erections.
Emard put it more lightly, presuming the audience would 
appreciate being entertained by the different pieces: "It can 
appeal to a lot of different people, she smiled.
Van Denend and Emard were on the right track. Thirty-eight 
models and 30 entertainers filled the stage at different times 
during the show. The entertainment fest included varying 
acts  in addition to the posing models, there were dance
performances and beat boxing extraordinaires, which closed 
to the nights loudest applause. The second half of the 
performance, "Bus Ride, featured the CMU breakers getting 
down alongside dancers in business suits. The audience 
roared with applause and laughter when senior computer 
science major Frank Denbow ripped his shirt off and tossed it 
off of the stage.
Lunar Gala is known for its blend of fashion and the bizarre, 
and this year was no exception. Hours before the show, the 
models changing rooms were lined with gigantic bows, 
Mardi Gras beads, and oddly shaped balloons. At showtime, 
some of the more unusual elements took form on the models, 
who added them to their styles.
One standout scene named Deviant, designed by H&SS firstyear Sanyu Kyeyune, featured original designs with a funk 
edge. Another prominent display created by junior design 
majors Diana C. Hurd and Mary K. Katica, named Woven, 
offered fashion-forward wearable designs.
Other scenes featured girls clad in vibrant bikinis, potato 
sacks dressed up With ribbons, gas masks, and red and white 
space suits. Even name brand apparel from United Colors 
of Benneton, Lost Orchid, Sisley, and Torque Denim made 
appearances throughout the night.
When asked to describe the Lunar Gala experience, __ 
Micciulla beamed  it gave her an excuse to buy new... 
lingerie. .'Its been a heavy commitment," she added. Other 
models murmured incoherent protests, but still admitted an 
appreciation for the chance to meet new people.
Yet, the lengthy practices that the models endured seem 
to have been worth it. There were no spills or falls and the 
show was clean and solid. And, despite the long nights, 
every model gained something from the experience. "A lot of 
different people get together for [Lunar Gala].... Its a bonding 
experience," said Micciulla.

Emard cited working with designers and other models as her 
favorite part of the Lunar Gala preparation: [The designers] 
have a vision and you are helping their vision come to 
fruition," she said. As a model, Emard explained, she had 
the opportunity to watch designs develop from sketchy to 
tangible onstage pieces. You see it all come together," she 
said. Emard also credited the executive board for their hard 
work  "They push your confidence.
And after the show? Spreading congratulations and good 
wishes, models and audience members mingled in the halls 
and outside of the Connan Room in the UC. "I'm so glad 
its over!" Micciulla screamed. With an array of models and 
friends, she attended the crowded after party to celebrate the 
end  and of course, the Chinese Lunar New Year.

ECE sweeps Mr. Engineer
E-week 2007 begins in a flash of duct tape
Get ready for closed systems, breadboards, and moments. No, 
you didnt stumble into a lab: next week is National Engineers 
Week, sponsored by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). 
Upcoming campus activities range from this afternoons 
paper airplane design competition in Kirr Commons to a game 
of Human Foosball Tuesday 2-4 p.m. in Skibo Gym.
And what better way to kick off E-week than a pageant? Enter 
Mr. Engineer. Mr. E is smart, talented, creative, and can mass 
balance his way out of anything. Representing the seven 
disciplines in CIT (and "undecided"), those competing went 
head-to-head last Friday in a contest of brains, brawn, and... 
more brains  contestants had to take the sines and cosines 
of unknown angles, for example. Chemical engineers went 
unrepresented, however, as no one accepted a nomination for 
Mr. ChemE. The panel of judges consisted of CIT students, 
faculty members, and administrators,
SWE's engineering week committee discussed a few ideas 
to start the week's festivities," explained host Estee Barbuto, 
a junior ChemE and active SWE member. We thought that 
Mr. Engineer would be a fun way to start [E-week] and that 
it would bring together various departments of engineering." 
Besides that, SWE had one other motivation: charity. The 
proceeds from Mr. Engineer will benefit the Susan G.
Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Before the first round of 
competition, Barbuto presented facts about breast cancer.
Mr. Engineer began with a talent competition. Mr. BME, 
Junior MechE/BME double major Vince Chiodo wowed 
the audience with his skills on the turntables. Mr. CivE,
sophomore Doug Facemyer, took on the persona of the 
Illusionist. Also quarterback for the Tartans, Facemyer 
mystified the crowd with his magic tricks  straight up 
Arrested Development style. An impressive candidate was 
Mr. EPP, junior MechE/EPP double major Scott Fortune. Fans 
were mesmerized as Fortune showed off his dance moves in a 
red duct tape Thriller-esque vest and matching shorts.
Taking place after a brief intermission, the second portion of 
the competition was Engineer Your Own Outfit Using Duct 
Tape. Already impressed with Fortunes duct-tape outfit, 
the audience was eager to see everyone else's creations.
Mr. Mystery, undecided first-year Robert Wiegmann, made a 
three-piece suit that actually looked wearable. Slightly less 
businesslike was Mr. MSE, sophomore MSE/BME double 
major Magnus Gan, who later revealed that he had turned on 
the TV and made the first thing he saw  unfortunately, that 
happened to be a dominatrix outfit, whip included.
The last event was the question-and-answer portion. Chosen 
at random, the questions ranged from Which came first, the 
chicken or the egg? to "What exactly is engineering? Mr. 
MechE, junior Brad Camburn, fielded the question, "Which 
element do you aspire to be and why?" Camburn explained 
that he would like to be fluorine, which has the highest 
electronegativity and can therefore bond with everyone."
In the end, the first-ever Mr. Engineer was Mr. ECE, fifth-year 
Bowei Gai. "My true joy of this talent comes with sharing it 
with everyone and seeing the smiles on their faces, Bowei 
said during his talent showcase. Earlier, Gai entertained the
audience with his ability to predict free food anywhere on 
campus on a given date (within two weeks, of course), not 
to mention his unbelievable duct-tape Transformers suit. It 
wasn't Ms. America, but Mr. Engineer still helped to kick off 
E-week with style  even if it was made out of duct tape.

It began with Open Diary. Xanga and LiveJournal showed 
up soon after. Then, the big ones: MySpace and Facebook.
Generation Y was the first age group to grow up with the 
Internet as an integral part of daily life, not to mention daily 
emotions. It was the first to log on to AOL Instant Messenger, 
the first to blog, and, if Ian Li and his team of programmers 
have gauged this generation correctly, Generation Y will have 
one more notch on its belt: Itll be the first generation to use 
computers to express emotions through color.
Welcome to MoodJam.org. Dubbed "Prettiest Gadget by 
the Google Gadget Awards, My MoodJam gives users the 
chance to display their emotions through color. Once users 
register, they simply choose the color or colors that represent 
their moods at a given time, add one or more adjectives, and 
click Post. Instantly, the screen displays a band of color(s) 
that expresses what the user is feeling. Users can also share 
their MoodJam pages by giving their friends and family their 
MoodJam usernames. Each username is linked to a webpage 
that can be accessed by anyone  registered or not.
A team of three Carnegie Mellon students, Karen Tang, Scott 
Davidoff, and Li, developed MoodJam at Carnegie Mellons 
Human Computer Interaction Institute. The website has 
been growing in popularity since it won the Google award. 
Currently, it has 2500 registered users with about 200 posts 
daily.
Its like making a mood painting.
Originally, the group members created the website so that 
they could become more aware of each other's moods in their 
small work environment. The idea initially wasn't to use the 
Internet," said Li, a member of the team. One of th ideas was 
to use a projection, like a display that everyone in the group 
could see. The idea was to come up with something quick and 
easy.
We had one way of expressing it with faces. At one point, 
people could select random images that expressed emotion, 
added Scott Davidoff, another team member. "But the color 
one... there's just something thats beautiful about it. There are 
a lot of faces that you can put on the data, but the current one 
is the most usable one.
Looking at the site, there are some expected color 
combinations ("sleepy with dark brown, etc.), though many 
are more interesting. For example, one user linked the phrase 
"angry, alone, and strong with the intense colors of white, 
blood red, and black. Thats not to say that the site is only 
used to express feelings easily diagnosed as either positive or 
negative. Last week, the mood banana was really popular," 
Davidoff said. One of the things that I think weve noticed 
is the huge variety of things that qualify as a mood that you 
might not have thought people would say. 'Arm.' Boot. They 
dont really fit in to any scientific definition of what moods 
mean." The words that people use are completely up to them; 
people can basically say whatever they feel, even if its not an 
adjective; its the color that makes it universal. It [the color] 
really expresses something someone can experience.
Contrary to what some might expect, there arent specific 
colors associated with any of the moods. "People put colors 
and some put a jumble of colors.... It seems to be pretty 
idiosyncratic what colors people associate with a particular 
mood," Li said. "Looking at it as a whole, it looks like a big 
jumble of colors, but the color is a good motivator for them 
to influence their moods. For instance, according to Li, a 
page full of dark, dreary Golors over a day or a week can help 
a person realize that he or she is going through a depressed 
stage.
Although the MoodJam team believes that seeing a pattern of
feelings 
might 
lead to 
a change 
in behavior, 
others disagree.
"In a broad way, 
disclosing information 
about patterns can be 
part of the process of 
changing behavior, but 
I dont think expressing a 
color palette on a website 
would be the sole inspiration, 
said Phillip Quinque, a visiting 
psychology professor.
Regardless of whether or not it is 
helpful to see patterns, the option 
is always available to users. The 
data is never deleted and there is no 
tool through which a bad day" can 
be taken off the users page. Maybe, 
eventually, some people may not be 
comfortable with that, Li said, "but so 
far, it'll be stored forever."
Mental health professionals often 
encourage patients to keep track of their 
changes in mood. Doctors call this process 
journaling. MoodJam is certainly a novel 
tool that a person could employ to self
monitor and look back, almost [as] if they're 
journaling, Quinque said. In psychology, 
the use of journaling and the therapeutic letter has been used 
for years. [MoodJam] could be a fun way to look at a persons 
mood  through color."
According to the team, the enjoyability and ease of the site are 
what make it appealing. I think part of the fun of doing it is 4 
just that we made a really nice, short way to express yourself," 
said Davidoff. "Doing that  in lots of psychology studies 
theyve just shown that it makes you feel better." The team 
hasnt done studies yet on whether MoodJam accomplishes 
the same goal, given that the phrases used in MoodJam are 
much shorter than a journal entry; however Davidoff believes 
that it allows the same therapeutic relief as journaling.
Weve made a way to express yourself without writing, he 
continued, or just a very terse, set way to express yourself 
emotively. Its like making a mood painting.
Looks like were feeling grumpy in the lab today...
Although sites like MoodJam, where users express 
their feelings through the Internet, are now considered 
commonplace, some worry about whether these sites 
encourage unhealthy relationships. "If an individual begins 
to believe that just expressing a color palette is [a] healthy 
substitute for human interaction, it becomes a danger, so 
to speak," Quinque said. Theres nodanger' with a human 
disclosing emotion with another human being. That's part 
of developing healthy relationships and managing ones 
emotions.
Still, many are in favor of online expression. According to the 
MoodJam team, the site actually encourages communication 
among friends. At a university where students monitor each
others online activities almost as much ^
as their own, the Internet is used as a tool for 
connecting friends, not strangers. Li said, If you know 
someone is happy or grumpy, you have something to start a 
conversation with.
Aubrey Shick, a collaborator on the MoodJam project, agreed 
that the site is a positive social tool. Ill have people IM me 
because my MoodJam is off. If anything, its supporting 
additional conversation, she said. To this end, the team is 
planning on unveiling user groups within MoodJam so that 
groups of people can create pages together and easily access 
the pages of friends. The group scoffed at the suggestion that 
this idea could minimize conversation between friends. "If 
anything, it'll probably support [conversation], Shick said.
 Looks like were feeling grumpy in the lab today  lets do 
something about it. Lets order donuts. 
Even for friends who are not physically close, Shick believes 
that MoodJam can still help with maintaining a relationship. 
Citing a personal experience, Shick explained that she recently 
helped create a MoodJam page for a friend studying abroad. 
"Shes in a foreign country, speaking a second language, and 
she has been really alienated, Shick said, and [MoodJam] has 
made her feel like people are paying attention to her emotions 
and care about her.
Only time will tell.
Facebook, MySpace, Xanga... MoodJam? Theres no predicting 
whether or not MoodJam will make it to the bookmarks page 
of Generation Y. However, there are certain things to keep 
in mind when using any program for online journaling or 
blogging. According to Quinque, its important not to worry 
too much about the emotions themselves; worry about why 
theyre there. As he put it, I dont think you can be too in 
touch with your emotions, but it is possible to ruminate over 
an emotion and stay stuck with the emotion rather thanunderstanding the origins of it. One example, Quinque 
explained, is a phrase familiar to the Carnegie Mellon campus: 
Im tired." Saying Im tired without paying attention to why 
will do nothing to remedy the exhaustion.

---------------------------------------------------

Moreover, 
websites 
like MoodJam 
may prove  
dangerous for 
younger users. Quinque 
explained that online 
expression can lead to a 
slippery slope for teenagers 
going through emotional crises 
before theyve emotionally matured.
"In the past two years, Ive seen some 
issues and problems emerge, particularly 
with MySpace, that some adolescents are 
expressing some kind of self-destructive and 
unhealthy desires which then influence other people,
Quinque said. They become influenced by other peoples 
websites with unsafe self-destructive behaviors such as 
sexual behavior and drug use. Unfortunately, these websites, 
which encourage negative behavior, are some of the most 
popular among developing teenagers.
Despite this, Quinque believes that there are some positive 
aspects to MoodJam and its peers. "I believe theres potential 
for [such websites] to be helpful and harmful, he said. Its 
always a matter of degree; if a person can strike a healthy 
balance and employ them to get more introspective, they can 
be a healthy adjunct.
Still, a person can only rely on the Internet to a certain extent. 
According to Quinque, if the balance between the real world 
and the virtual world is lost, online emoting can become 
unhealthy. However, he continued, theres a limited amount of 
information available on the risks associated with online
expression.
"Certainly, it opens 
the door to see what 
happens with people over 
the course of time. Even with 
MySpace, Ive seen some positive 
things and some healthy things," Quinque 
said. Only time will tell.

Poetry: slammed and published
Susan B. A. Somers-Willett visits Hunt Library
On February 12, visiting faculty fellow and poet Susan B.
A. Somers-Willett gave a reading of her original work at 
the Margaret Morrison Caf. Somers-Willet, who has won 
numerous awards and literary accolades, teaches at the 
Center for the Arts in Society at Carnegie Mellon. She has 
taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and 
served as assistant director of the Graduate Creative Writing 
Program at the University of Texas at Austin.
English professor Jim Daniels provided a warm introduction 
for Somers-Willett at the reading. "Every time I talk to usan, 
it seems like her career and her poetry are going somewhere 
.-new and exciting, he said. Daniels is right; Somers-Willetts 
work has been garnering praise and recognition from many 
quarters. Poets and Writers magazine featured Somers-Willett 
in its November/December issue, recognizing her as one of 
the finest debut poets of 2006. Somers-Willett also received 
the 2006 Emily Clark Balch Prize for Poetry, an annual award 
bestowed on one poet by the Virginia Quarterly Review.
In 2005, Somers-Willett was awarded the Robert Frost 
Foundation Award in Poetry.
"I've realized that when I wrote these poems, they served as 
voices, to say things I couldn't  but which I needed to have 
said, Somers-Willet explained. Specifically, she was speaking 
of Roam, a collection of her poetry that was recently published 
as part of the Crab Orchard Award Series Open Competition,
' a contest sponsored by the Crab Orchard Review. Last 
Monday, Somers-Willett read selected works from Roam, in 
addition to sharing some of her new, unpublished work.
Describing herself as a poet of the stage and the page," 
Somers-Willett is a slam poet as well one who works in 
traditional print media. At the reading, Somers-Willett 
gave an entertaining and thought-provoking reading of her
performance piece, "Ophelia and the Technicolor G-String: An 
Urban Mythology. Using her body and tone of voice to subtly 
convey emotions and nuances of the language, Somers-Willett 
moved the audience to laughter with lines such as:
Oh Hamlet, if you could see me now
as I pump and swagger across that stage, cape dripping to
the floor,
me in three-inch heels and a technicolor G-string 
you would not wish me in a convent.
Somers-Willett has researched slam culture and poetics 
extensively. While at the University of Illinois, she completed 
a manuscript of criticism titled The Cultural Politics of Slam 
Poetry: Race and the Rise of Popular Verse in America. 
Somers-Willett is also a contributing editor for RATTLE 
magazines tribute issue, which will celebrate the 21st 
anniversary of the poetry slam, in 2007. While at Carnegie 
Mellon, Somers-Willett has been exploring related themes 
in slam poetry by researching the impact of public poetry 
projects on American culture.
Somers-Willett has also competed in three National Poetry 
Slams. The lush musicality of Somers-Willetts language 
reflects her interest and admiration of the genre, and her lively 
and engaging delivery pay rich tribute to slam poetry's vibrant 
performance tradition. It is the music of language  the odd 
and perfect turn of phrase, the rhythm of it ringing in my head 
for days  that compels my writing," stated Somers-Willett, 
as quoted on her website. Writing performance poetry is a 
dialogue between mediums, she explained. "I rarely find that 
my writing wants to stay on the page alone. It's lonely there."
Many of the themes in Roam are on experiences that 
Somers-Willett had as a young person growing up in New
Orleans. Somers-Willett said at the reading that the theme of 
displacement figures largely in her work: the death of a parent 
when she was a young woman and her subsequent move 
away from the family home, both of which gave her a deep 
sense of displacement.
Somers-Willetts newest poems, which will appear in her 
upcoming book, Quiver, have moved to different topics. As 
stated in a press release from last October, Quivers poems 
explore the science, mathematics, and evolution of love and 
beauty. At Hunt Library, Somers-Willett read some of these 
new poems, which examined the love between Marie and 
Pierre Curie and their work with radioactivity. The poems 
looked at the connections Marie desperately sought to make 
between radioactivity and the spirit world after Pierres 
death. Drawing on historic detail as well as her own gift with 
language, these poems give life to a past often consigned to 
dry history texts, and vivify scientific subjects that Carnegie 
Mellon students may find interesting, but are not often the 
focus of poetry.
Susan B. A. Somers-Willett is an artist whose versatility truly 
represents Carnegie Mellons cross-disciplinary aspirations. 
Her ability to blend genres and incorporate unconventional' 
subject matter into her work is admirable; Somers-Willett is an 
example of someone who has taken her diverse personal and 
research interests and made them a successful profession. 
Look for Quiver, coming soon, to see this exciting poets new 
work. 
Annika Rosenvinge | Junior Staffwriter
Susan B.A. Somers-Wiljett 
performed her poetry last Monday 
afternoon at the Margaret 
Morrison Caf in Hunt Library. 
Somers-Willett shared some of 
her older work, from her collection 
Roam, in addition to some newer 
poetry from Quiver.
