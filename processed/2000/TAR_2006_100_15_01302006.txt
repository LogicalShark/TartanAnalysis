WELLESLEY COLLEGE: Wang Campus Center, 
built in 2005
by J.T. Trollman
Contributing Editor
The University will soon have a 5.6-acre hole to 
fill on campus  and theyre plugging it with an 
' undertaking so large that even Henry Hornbostel, 
the schools original architect, thought it too big to 
tackle.
The plug is the new Gates Center for Computer 
Science  along with a new 150-car garage and a 
 west campus quad as well.
Estimated to finish by 2009, the project will cost
an estimated $88 million, $20 million of which 
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated 
in September 2004. In comparison to the current 
newest building on campus  the Collaborative 
Innovation Center  the Gates Center is roughly 
61 percent larger, at 208,000 square feet. Its also 
244 percent more expensive and will sit on one of 
the most difficult plots of land Carnegie Mellon has 
to offer.
Now, out of the 30 architectural firms that ap
plied for the project, the nationally recognized 
Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects is set to take 
up the challenge.
The Firm
Atlanta-based Mack Scogin Merrill Elam focuses a 
great deal of its work on educational buildings, hav
ing built libraries and university structures across 
the country. The firm received the 1995 Academy 
Award in Architecture from the American Academy 
of Arts and Letters and the 1996 Chrysler Award for 
Innovation in Design. Narrowed down from a pack 
of 30 companies, the firm was one of three finalists 
for the building, along with prestigious associates 
like Kohn Pedersen Fox and Raphael Vignoli. 
vj We do architecture  we do contemporary ar
chitecture  that addresses the kinds of technology 
and lifestyle and work style that you see in [the] 
present-day world, said Mack Scogin in a telephone 
interview last Friday. With the Gates building plans, 
he said, I think now were somewhere in the neigh
borhood of at least 9 or 10 [drafts] at this point. 
They are the most amazing architects to work 
with because they are just so nimble with their 
ideas, said Ralph Horgan, CMUs vice-provost for 
campus design and facility development. You sug

Campus to 
see changes
by Andrew Peters
Staffwriter
This semester, the Campus 
Planning office is working on two 
projects that will change the face 
of the Carnegie Mellon campus.
First, Jonathan Borofskys sculp
ture Walking to the Sky will be 
installed on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus this spring. The sculpture 
will be positioned on the lawn 
between Baker and Doherty halls. 
The sculptures principal feature 
is a 100-foot-high, two-foot-wide 
steel pole, which rises at a 75- 
degree angle to the ground. Three 
life-size resin figures will be lo
cated around its base, with seven 
more mounted on the pole.
Borofsky studied at CMU (BFA) 
and the Yale School of Art (MFA). 
He has created over 30 pieces of 
public sculpture for cities all over 
the world. Borofsky first exhib
ited Walking to the Sky in New 
York Citys Rockefeller Center in 
2004. Though some critics at the 
time commented that the sculp
ture was a reaction to the events 
of September 11, Borofsky has re
peatedly said that the piece holds 
no political implications.
Ralph Horgan, vice-provost 
of campus design and facilities 
development, is in charge of the 
sculptures installation. We un
derstand that the area is used 
for orientation tents and sports

Casinos proposed for Pittsburgh
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
Pittsburgh has an urban re
development plan in the works 
to enhance students city ex
perience. Competition for 
Pittsburghs lone slots license 
heated up this week with the 
news of a joint proposal by 
Harrahs Entertainment Inc. 
and Forest City Enterprises for 
a $1 billion-plus Station Square 
Casino complex. The plan, un
like the joint proposal of the Isle 
of Capri Casinos'and Pittsburgh 
Penguins, does not include the 
new hockey arena that many in 
the city so desire.
_ On the heels of shopping meccas such as South Side Works, 
the Waterfront, and the Strip
District, three groups currently 
remain in contention for the 
rights to the $50 million slots 
license. All of the plans include 
extensive neighborhood devel
opment.
Harrahs Station Square Casino 
would operate a casino that 
would be developed along with 
condominiums by Clevelandbased Forest City Enterprises.
Were going to create, if you 
will, a new neighborhood for 
Pittsburgh, Brian Ratner, Forest 
Citys vice-president of East Coast 
development, told the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review last Tuesday.
Ratner also informed The 
Tartan that the plan features 
clubs, all-ages music venues 
housing a wide variety of genres, 
and restaurants. Even the col
lege students that are of gam
bling age are going to be on tight 
budgets, so the facility will not 
be all about gambling, he said.
Detroit casino operator Don 
Barden would be the lead de
veloper for a $300-$350 mil
lion Majestic Star Casino and en
tertainment complex on North 
Shore property. Barden owns 17 
acres of riverfront property near 
Heinz Field. Four restaurants, 
a sports bar, a beer garden, a 
coffee shop, two nightclubs, and 
a 1000-seat amphitheater are in
cluded in this plan, according 
to a January 24 Pittsburgh PostGazette report.

Hanadie Yousef s October 
17 article, Israels pullout 
from Gaza is a charade, 
contained several statements 
requiring clarification:
1) Palestinians are 
mewed up in the worlds 
most crowded ghetto. The 
population density of Gaza 
is 3823 people per square ki
lometer, which is lower than 
many cities in the world. 
Those cities do not neces
sarily qualify as ghettos, 
which are sections of a city 
occupied by a minority 
group living there because 
of social, economic, or legal 
pressure.
2) Development projects 
would cut the West Bank in 
half. The planned projects 
would drastically separate 
some Palestinian territo
ries, but not the entire West 
Bank.
3) Fifty percent of Pal
estinians are jobless.... Ac
cording to the CIA Factbook, 
the unemployment rate in 
Palestine was 1.9.9 percent 
in 2005. Earlier estimates 
placed unemployment 
among Palestinians as high
as 60 percent.
4) .500,000 Israeli citi
zens are living illegally in 
the West Bank. This statistic 
includes the disputed East 
Jerusalem territory as part 
of the West Bank.
5) Palestinian children are 
starving. Available data re
garding the malnourishment 
of Palestinians is incomplete. 
Past reports have indicated 
that a serious humanitarian 
crisis exists.
6) There are numerous 
checkpoints in Palestinian 
territory that prevent travel 
from one town to another. 
The checkpoints impede 
travel from town to town. 
They do not prohibit it en
tirely.

modern Middle East, has fo
cused her research on the re
lationship between Israel and 
Palestine and is co-authoring 
a textbook on the Arab-Israeli 
peace processes.
After receiving her doctorate
from the University of Michigan 
in 1990, she began at Carnegie 
Mellon University as an 
adjunct history department 
member in 1992. She has con
tributed pieces to manyjournals 
and worked extensively with 
other historians to understand 
the complicated circumstances.
In the lecture, Eisenberg 
will present the conflicts basic 
vocabulary and geography. 
With so much history behind 
the situation, Eisenberg will 
discuss salient events that led 
up to the Israeli-Palestinian 
impasse to give a picture of its 
underpinnings.
So many key terms have be
come very important but not 
very widely known, and Eisen
berg wants to help disseminate 
them among what she calls the 
typical news audience. Such 
terms include intifada, Camp 
David 2, and Oslo.
Employing maps, Eisenberg 
will also discuss contested ar
eas and visually demonstrate 
the confrontations geographi
cal facets.
The historian doesnt plan on 
speaking about current affairs 
such as Israeli resettlement or 
ongoing politics, hoping her 
approach will allow audience
members see how current af
fairs came about. Eisenberg 
also aims for objectivity in her 
presentation by not pressing 
the views of one side or the 
other. My point is education, 
not advocacy, she said.
Eisenberg noted that while 
things dont seem to be untan
gling, she sees potential for im
provement.
She also sees a clear con
nection between her subject 
and Carnegie Mellon students. 
CMU students are citizens of 
the world, she said. This is a 
very important conflict, and the 
media is saturated with it.

Last week, Science and Technol
ogy editor Hanadie Yousef received an 
e-mail that read, The article in The 
Tartan is just great! I really appreci
ate your letting the student body know 
about the fun things going on in chem
istry. With every issue we get feedback 
from readers. A lot is positive, like the 
message above, but inevitably some is 
critical.
Hanadie also received an angry email complaining about inaccuracies 
in another article. Every editor at The 
Tartan takes his or her responsibility 
very seriously, and we spend a lot of 
time thinking about how to do more 
for our readers.
Thinking about the innumerable 
comments and suggestions that weve 
gotten in the past year has spurred me 
to think about our mission. For years, 
the leadership of The Tartan worked as 
though our responsibility started and 
ended with publishing the newspaper. 
In reality, we want to help our commu
nity be a better place.
The Tartan has always reported the 
news, offered a forum for public de
bate, and covered the arts and enter
tainment scene in Pittsburgh. But if we 
do just that, we havent necessarily ac
complished our goal of improving our 
community  it takes a lot more than 
just putting pen to paper.
In the past few months, members 
of The Tartans staff and I have been 
thinking more broadly about what we 
need to do to succeed in our mission. 
What we came to realize is that we 
needed to be more practical in our ap
proach to development. Now, as we go 
about our work, we try to find ways to 
make The Tartan more useful.
Were developing new ways to le
verage the flexibility of the Internet 
to offer better services for students 
 weve got some great concepts for 
our website that we hope to move 
on this year. Were going reduce our 
dependence on the student activities 
fee by working on our sales and keep
ing bur budget tight  we plan to 
ask for a smaller subsidy from stu
dent government next year, so other, 
newer organizations can have a great
er share of the pie. Also, were working 
to enhance our presence in the 
community; this part were begin
ning now.
Last Thursday, the undergraduate 
Student Senate approved a special 
allocation for the purchase of the first 
set of outdoor newspaper boxes that we 
are going to locate on and off campus 
and a set of indoor newspaper stands 
to place in coffee shops and restaurants 
in the neighboring communities. With
in a year, were aiming to have outdoor 
newspaper boxes in Oakland, Squirrel 
Hill, and Shadyside, and indoor racks 
at establishments in all those areas. 
We hope this will help put The Tartan 
in new, convenient locations for 
students and expose the community we 
live in to the happenings of Carnegie 
Mellon.
Also within the next year, we plan to 
place new newspaper racks at all of our 
on-campus drop points, so our news
papers are off the ground, orderly, and 
more visible.
Most immediately, well be distrib
uting copies of The Tartan by hand 
every Monday. More than 150 people 
dedicate hours of their time to creating 
each issue of The Tartan  thats about 
one out of every 35 undergraduates. 
Most undergraduates probably have 
class with at least one member of The 
Tartans staff, but they dont know it.
Were proud of our work, and were 
eager to be more available and respon
sive to our readership. We hope that 
putting faces with the newspaper will 
help make us a more open organiza
tion. We started this new practice last 
week. I must say that personally giv
ing a newspaper to someone who was 
eager to have it felt great.
In our busy CMU culture, its easy to 
get stuck in the daily grind, waiting for 
feedback. Our hope is to become closer 
to more of the community, so by the 
time we get a suggestion, were already 
working on the implementation.

Being Green, in More Ways

Connecting the Campus and 
Breaking TraditionIn recent years, Carnegie 
Mellon has taken a leading role 
in exclusively creating LEEDcertified buildings, all of which 
match up to a national standard 
of sustainability and environ
mental concern. To that end, the 
university has asked that both 
the building and its surrounding 
landscape follow examples like 
New House and the Henderson 
House rebuild.
Altogether, Scogin said, the 
universitys board of trustees has 
challenged them to achieve a 
silver LEED certification for the 
site. And right now, he asserted, 
were not only on track for it, well 
far exceed their expectations.
It wont be easy to complete a 
project that reaches across such 
a daunting section of topography. 
In fact, one of Henry Hornbostels 
original master plans simply used 
the whole depression as a natural 
bowl for playing fields. Campus 
planners have avoided the concept 
of erecting anything on the 
future site of the Gates building 
for decades.
Its really interesting, said 
Scogin. If you look up the history 
of the development of the campus 
over the years from its beginning 
with Hornbostel, theres been a 
number of master plans and studTackling the Site
Its been no easy task, though 
in part because before the Gates

Campus to witness several changes this semester
Justin Brown/Assistant Photo Editor
A view of the Mall shows where Borofskys sculpture will be 
installed this spring.
CHANGES, from A1
practice, Horgan said in response 
to concerns that the new sculpture 
would decrease usable space on the 
Cut. The sculpture will not intrude 
physically into that space.
Changes of another kind are slated 
for March. Four buildings on campus 
will be demolished in preparation for 
groundbreaking on the Gates Center 
later this year: the Old Student Center 
at 4902 Forbes Avenue, the campus 
printing and publications building, 
the Planetary Robotics building, and 
a set of garages between NewellSimon and Hamburg Halls.
Horgan and other members of the Campus 
Planning office are in the process of relocat
ing groups that filled the 40,000-square-foot 
Old Student Center. Staff groups have been 
relocated off campus, while most student 
and academic development groups have
moved to the UC or Wean Hall.
In connection with the Gates Center proj
ect, campus police have moved to a new 
headquarters, the former Vision Services 
Building at 300 South Craig Street.
Some campus members feel this relocation 
will result in a less accessible police force.
Based on customer feedback to date 
... our new location has not caused 
any problems or concerns, said 
campus security chief Creig Doyle. 
Doyle went on to express his hope 
that as the semester goes on, campus 
security will report high levels of ef
ficiency and accessibility.
Many academic groups have been 
moved to offices in the newly outfit
ted basement of the UC, near Andys. 
A PNC Bank office branch has also 
moved to the UC basement.
Before demolition can proceed on 
any of the four buildings, crews will 
survey them for asbestos abatement 
and relocate utility tunnels in the 
vicinity.
According to Horgan, the demolition of 
all four buildings should be complete by 
late March or early April, leaving developers 
seven months to prepare the site for con
struction on the Gates Center.
Student Rights proposal comes closer to approval
Medical examiner indicted 
for trading corpses
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
Intending to clarify students 
rights in the classroom, a pro
posed amendment to University 
Policy came a step closer to being 
approved last week.
If passed, the amendment 
would append a third right in 
the Students Rights section of 
University Policy: The third 
right of students is to be evalu
ated based on stated course cri
teria and appropriate knowledge 
of the subjects and disciplines 
they study.
Michael Bueti, chair of the 
Academic Affairs committee of 
Student Senate, and Indira Nair, 
vice-provost for education and 
chair of the University Education 
Council (UEC), presented the 
proposed amendment to the 
Faculty Senate last Tuesday.
The intention behind this pol
icy amendment is really to clarify 
current policy, Bueti said at the 
Faculty Senate meeting. We feel 
this is an important one [for stu
dents], so they know theyre be
ing graded on the quality of work 
... rather than expressing a dif
fering opinion than professors.
The amendments initiative
originated last semester with 
then-Academic Affairs chair, 
Long Pham. Many people feel 
the university is an academic 
environment in which academic 
freedom should be promoted. 
Unfortunately, faculty members 
are human beings  they have 
biases, and some people feel that 
interferes with their grades, 
Pham said in an interview with 
The Tartan last October.
At Tuesdays meeting, Nair 
cited a context for the amend
ment: She has heard three cases 
from students regarding grad
ing evaluation in the last five 
years. According to Nair, original 
faculty assessment prevailed in 
two of the cases, while a faculty 
member renegotiated a students 
grade in the third.
This is what we see as the 
first step in clarifying rights for 
students, Bueti said.
Nair corroborated this aim in 
an interview following the meet
ing. The only additon to the doc
ument, she said, is how students 
will be specifically evaluated in 
courses.
Faculty Senate members had 
mixed feelings on the proposal. 
The problem is implementa
tion of said policy, said assistant 
department head of mathemati
cal sciences John Mackey at the 
Senate meeting. We all, or many 
of us in academics, feel under 
attack  from the initiative at 
UCLA, to the [corporate nature] 
of the classroom, and various 
other things.
Mackeys reference regards 
the recent exposure of the 
website UCLAProfs.com, a site 
run by UCLAs Bruin Alumni 
Association and dedicated to 
exposing UCLAs most radical 
professors as proof of an in
creasingly radical faculty. The 
association offers students $100 
for evidence showing profes
sors radical objectives and then 
publishes the professors profiles 
online.
Yes, it may be a laudable goal 
to achieve. Its just that the im
plementation of it comes at a 
time when maybe were feeling a 
little bit under attack from vari
ous forces, Mackey said.
Senate members also drew at
tention to other national initia
tives to monitor professors ide
ologies in the classroom. One 
such initiative, conservative ac
tivist David Horowitzs Academic 
Bill of Rights proposal, has been 
promoted to several state legisla
tures, including Pennsylvania.
In the beginning of this
amendment process, the na
tional movement wasnt some
thing in the minds of Academic 
Affairs, Bueti responded. This 
is in no way linked to that [docu
ment] at all.
Heinz School professor Robert 
Strauss also drew attention to 
the amendments elusive term 
appropriate, questioning who 
will determine what knowledge 
and material will be deemed cor
rect. Strauss suggested following 
appropriate knowledge with 
as determined by the 
professor.
My one concern with this 
statement is the lack of stu
dent input that has gone into 
this, Student Body President 
Tom Sabram said at the Faculty 
Senate meeting. Sabram said 
that neither students outside of 
Senate nor l;he members of the 
Graduate Student Assembly have 
heard the proposal.
For now, Bueti will take the 
proposal back to the Academic 
Affairs committee and the UEC, 
review it, and bring the pro
posal back to Faculty Senate in 
February to ask for a motion 
to accept. Once approved,. the 
Presidents Council must ap
prove the policys content before 
the amendment can be added.
INDICTMENT, from A1
of instruction in the Universitys 
forensic sciences program.
The Tartan was unable to elicit 
further comment from Charles 
Gibbons, Carlows attorney, but 
he told other news sources that 
the bodies were used strictly for 
the teaching purposes of the 
university.
The agreement was to use 
bodies from Wechts private prac
tice for instruction during anatomy 
classes. However, the indictment 
claims Wecht used bodies that be
longed to Allegheny County and 
bodies that required no autopsy.
The former medical examiners 
private practice has flourished 
recently, having grossed approxi
mately $8.75 million between 
1997 and 2004. Were very 
pleased with his work. For what 
the tax-payers pay for an au
topsy, were getting world-quality work right in our back yard, 
Kenneth Bacha, the coroner of 
Westmoreland County told The 
Tartan.
However, it is that same prac
tice that has come into question 
with the recent charges that he 
used county employees to con
duct his own business.
Wechts attorney, former 
U.S. Attorney General Dick 
Thornburgh, issued a statement 
formally denying the charges and 
questiong the jurisdiction of Mary
Beth Buchanan, the U.S. attor
ney who issued the indictment. 
Traditionally, a U.S. attorney can
not prosecute someone based 
on his actions at a county level, 
such as Wechts involvement in 
Allegheny County. But the indict
ment stated that federal authori
ties have jurisdiction because the 
county uses federal courts.
Wecht is popular in the forensics and medical field, having 
worked on well-known cases 
including the assassination of 
President John F. Kennedy and 
the death of Elvis Presley. Wechts 
name became even more popular 
in the 1990s for consulting in the 
O.J. Simpson case and the death 
of JonBenet Ramsey.
Students at Carnegie Mellon 
may also know Wecht for his 
recent appearance on campus. 
Wecht was part of a panel dis
cussion during the Martin Luther 
King Day celebrations, only five 
days before his resignation.
Even with the current indict
ment, many county coroners 
offices have stated they still in
tend to hire Wecht due to his 
precedent. From what weve 
seen in the indictment, nothing 
has to do with poor work, re
marked Bacha.
Wecht currently oversees au
topsies in Clarion, Greene, and 
Westmoreland counties.
Hes really first-class, Bacha 
said.

smallest fish
In an acidic peat swamp in Thai
land, scientists have found the 
worlds smallest fish. The fish lives 
in dark, tea-colored water with an 
acidity of pH 3 (at least 100 times 
more acidic than rainwater), it 
has a see-through body, and a 
head that is unprotected by a skel
eton. These small fishes are of the 
species Paedocypris progenetica, 
a member of the carp family. Fe
males only grow to 7.9 millimeters 
(0.31 inches) and males have en
larged pelvic fins and exception
ally large muscles that may be 
used to grasp the female during 
copulation. This is one of the 
strangest fish that Ive seen in my 
whole career, said Ralf Britz, a

Carbon nanotubes help 
detect genetic mutations
by Hanadie Yousef
Science & Technology Editor
University of Pittsburgh re
searcher Alexander Star, in 
collaboration with Californiabased company Nanomix, Inc., 
has developed devices made of 
carbon nanotubes that can de
tect mutated genes that may 
cause hereditary diseases.
This approach to detecting 
gene mutations increases the 
speed of detection in compari
son to conventional techniques. 
It will also dramatically decrease 
the cost and inconvenience as
sociated with this type of genetic 
detection.
The development of this type 
of technology will enable labelfree detection of mutated DNA 
sequences, said Star, an assis
tant professor of chemistry at the 
University of Pittsburgh.
Carbon nanotubes are cylin
drical carbon molecules with 
innovative properties that make 
them potentially useful in a wide 
variety of applications. These in
clude nano-electronics, optics, 
and now, detection of genetic 
mutations, as shown by Star and 
colleagues. Carbon nanotubes 
are only a few nanometers wide 
 they span the width of a mol
ecule of DNA. This makes them 
highly compatible with DNA, 
allowing sensitive detection. 
Carbon nanotubes exhibit ex
traordinary strength and unique 
electrical properties, and are ef
ficient conductors of heat.
The carbon nanotube device 
works by using the nanotubes 
electrical properties to detect 
unusual mutations in DNA. 
The device is a network of single-walled carbon nanotubes 
(SWNTs) deposited onto interdigitated electrodes. They are 
used to make conductance mea
surements. DNA sequences bind 
to the surface of the SWNTs; 
hybridization  the matching 
of DNA to its complementary 
strands  is electronically mea
sured by changes in conductivi
ty. Simply put, healthy DNA and 
mutated DNA will give different 
electronic responses when hy
bridization occurs, Star said.
The nanotube device was used 
to find a particular mutation in 
hereditary hemochromatosis, 
an inherited disorder that in
creases the amount of iron that

the body absorbs from the gut. 
The iron is then deposited in ex
cess in a variety of organs. Most 
commonly, excess iron in the, 
liver causes cirrhosis, which may 
develop into liver cancer. Iron 
deposits in the pancreas can re
sult in diabetes.
The nanotube device will be 
able to detect many other kinds

story of contracting the disease at 16 from 
her only partner, after which her mother

universal expansion at a faster 
rate than expected.
One problem with this theory 
is that its predicted energy from 
the cosmological constant is as 
much as 120 magnitudes too 
large, resulting in what is known 
as the cosmological constant 
problem.
Quintessence is a theo
retical, undiscovered substance 
that makes up the vast majority 
of the energy in the universe. 
Quintessence has a density and 
equation of state that varies 
through time and space. Think 
of it as an oscillation similar to 
that of a pendulum. The cosmo
logical constant theory, on the 
other hand, has a fixed energy 
density with no varying terms. 
The fact that quintessence is 
dynamic makes it difficult to ob
serve. Currently there is no evi
dence supporting it.
No matter which theory is 
true, if dark energy continues to 
behave as it is, it will eventually 
become the most dominating 
force in the universe, resulting 
in the Big Rip. Once it domi
nates, it will tear apart all gravitationally bound structures, 
such as solar systems and galax
ies. The final deed will be when 
dark energy overcomes nuclear 
and electrical forces, causing at
oms to be torn apart.
So what have we have learned 
today? .We do not know what 
dark energy is, but eventually 
it is going to tear our universe 
apart! So, theres one theory as 
to how the end of the world will 
come about.

Getting a $2 million research 
grant is a bit unusual, but then so 
are the researchers who work in 
Carnegie Mellons Engineering 
and Public Policy department 
(EPP). Theyre more politically 
opinionated than your typical 
scientists, but these EPP profes
sors all have advanced degrees in 
physics, computer science, and 
biology. Although they currently 
teach, previous job experiences 
range from NASA shuttle astro
naut to university president to 
chemical weapons inspector. The 
application of their varying tech
nological expertise to real-life 
problems has been so successful 
that the John D. and Catherine 
T. MacArthur Foundation has re
newed their substantial endow
ment for the next five years.
EPP department head Granger 
Morgan said that EPP works 
on problems where the techni
cal details really matter. This 
is political science with strong 
emphasis on the science. Their 
research focuses on intimidating 
issues such as nuclear terrorism, 
plague, communication between 
emergency responders, and at
tacks on the electrical grid.
Morgan explained that the 
EPPs mission is concerned with 
figuring out how to make our 
society less vulnerable to attacks 
we might prevent, more resilient 
in the face of attacks we cant 
prevent, and more informed 
about what to do when we face 
problems of this sort.
Morgan noted that even a 
small amount of money can make 
a big impact, and described how 
an EPP professor at MIT found 
flaws in a missile system based 
only on TV footage. After 9/11, 
the MacArthur Foundation de
cided to revive the EPPs work on 
international and domestic secu
rity issues. Apparently pleased 
with the EPPs resulting accom
plishments, such as professor
Keith Florigs mail terrorism pre
vention project and Ph D student 
Matt Dombroskis analysis of a 
theoretical dirty bomb attack in 
Pittsburgh, the foundation re
cently renewed the grant, fund
ing nine main research projects.
This time around, Florig is in
vestigating the idea of nuclear 
terrorism from a civilian perspec
tive. He wonders what the best 
strategies are that the average 
person should follow in order 
to survive a nuclear attack. Flo
rig, who has four degrees from 
Carnegie Mellon, said that un
fortunately, in the current geo
political climate, we have to take 
seriously the risk that terrorists 
might obtain a nuclear weapon 
and use it in an American city.
Although the U.S. Depart
ment of Homeland Securitys 
website gives plenty of advice for 
handling nuclear terrorism, Flo
rig stated that if you followed 
some of that advice, you could

No, dark energy is not a 
reference to Star Trek or any 
other syndicated sci-fi series. 
Dark energy is not the same as 
your excuse for your completely 
immoral behavior, and it is cer
tainly not the reason your dog 
ran away. With the elimination 
of these possibilities, we now 
have a similar understanding to 
that of the scientific community 
as to what dark energy is. The 
concept is so new that in July 
2003 former CMU professor 
Robert Nichol appeared on The 
Late Show with David Letterman 
to discuss the research that he 
and the Sloan Digital Sky Sur
vey have done in regard to dark 
energy.
Dark energy is a theoreti
cal form of energy that is cur
rently thought to make up about 
70 percent of the universe, and 
is causing the universe to ex
pand at a more accelerated rate 
than previously expected. This 
accelerated rate is the result of a 
strong negative pressure which 
is able to overcome the forces of 
gravity.
Take for example a balloon. 
Put two dots on the balloon rep
resenting two arbitrary points 
in the universe. As you blow 
air into the balloon, the dots 
begin to move apart as the skin 
of the balloon expands. This is 
the same manner in which uni
versal expansion works. Bodies 
in the universe are accelerating 
away from each other due to the 
V expansion of the labric of the
universe itself.
However, a new dynamic was 
added in 1998 when two groups 
of astronomers studying type 1A 
supernovae (exploding stars) 
noticed that these supernovae 
were dimmer than expected. 
This discovery revealed that the 
supernovae were farther away 
than they should have been in 
the absence of dark energy.
Now take your balloon from 
before, deflate it, and add some 
dark energy. As you blow into 
it, the density of dark energy 
becomes smaller and smaller. 
In turn it exerts an increasingly 
large amount of negative pres
sure, causing the balloon to 
expand at an even higher rate.
I know what you are thinking  
where was dark energy when I 
was spending all that time blow
ing up my air mattress? True, in 
theory, the negative pressure 
would have helped, but the fact 
is it only works in large doses, 
too big for the purposes of this 
Earth.
Further evidence for its 
existence is the so-called miss
ing mass problem. By observ
ing the cosmic microwave 
background radiation, evidence 
for the Big Bang, astronomers 
are able to account for only 30 
percent of the matter in the uni
verse. Dark energy would be this 
missing 70 percem.

CMU scientist develops technique to detect transplant rejection
Organ rejection could be detected using magnetic resonance imaging
Courtesy of Chien Ho
Chien Ho and colleagues are using a heart transplantation model in rats (above) to develop 
a non-invasive, MRI-based method to detect organ rejection. Scientists label immune cells 
with iron oxide particles and track their accumulation, an early sign of organ rejection.
by Kathy Chiapaikeo
Staffwriter
Organ transplant rejection, particu
larly of the heart, is a major obstacle to 
successful transplantation today. There 
were 2016 heart transplants performed 
in the United States in 2004, and 2057 
in 2000, according to the American 
Heart Association. With this many peo
ple needing heart transplants, it is im
portant to prevent these foreign organs 
from being rejected by the host persons 
immune system.
What if there were a way to detect heart 
transplant rejection before it happened? 
The results of the surgery could be pre
dicted, and the number of failed trans
plants would decrease greatly.
In Chien Hos laboratory at the Pitts
burgh Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
(NMR) Center for Biomedical Research, 
great discoveries have been made in de
tecting organ rejection before it occurs in 
the patient. This noninvasive approach 
involves labeling immune cells, mainly 
macrophages, with iron oxide particles, 
which are easily traced by magnetic reso
nance imaging (MRI). The labeled mac
rophages can be found around rejection 
sites.
When last-stage organ failure occurs, 
the organ is so damaged that it can no lon
ger be repaired, and the only treatment is 
transplantation. Organ transplantation 
faces many challenges, including organ 
rejections and a shortage of donor or
gans, which is why it would be very ad
vantageous to detect rejection of trans
planted organs before it happens.
The procedures taken to reduce risk of 
rejection following transplants are costly, 
unpleasant, and repetitive. Immunosup
pressive therapy involves injecting the 
patient with cyclosporin, an agent used 
to reduce the bodys natural immune 
defenses. This prevents the patients 
immune system from attacking and de
stroying the foreign organ. Cyclosporin

approach involves 
labeling immune 
cells, mainly mac
rophages, with iron 
oxide particles, 
which are easily 
traced by magnetic 
resonance imaging 
(MRI).
must be used carefully; too much cyclo
sporin can be dangerous, since it is a very 
strong drug, but too little of the drug can 
result in organ rejection.
Heart biopsy, performed during the 
first year after the transplant, is a diag
nostic procedure in which a catheter is 
inserted through a vein or artery to one 
of the ventricles of the heart. Three to five
small pieces of tissue are removed from 
the heart muscle and examined by pa
thologists to determine whether immune 
cells are present, indicating potential 
rejection. This invasive procedure can 
produce inaccurate results because the 
biopsies only focus on the area where tis
sue was removed rather than the whole 
organ. The area where rejection is oc
curring could be missed completely. Hos 
noninvasive procedure can avoid this 
pitfall, since it is capable of using MRI to 
detect the labeled immune cells location 
throughout the entire heart.
We are very excited about our MRI 
detection of cardiac rejection in our ro
dent model. We hope that our noninva
sive approach to detect organ rejection 
will be applied to humans after addi
tional research, Ho said.
Hos research involved transplant
ing a functional heart into a rats abdo
men and observing the effects. Ho and 
his team studied how the transplanted 
heart changed through the stages of re
jection while the rat was still healthy. 
Immune cells injected three days prior 
to the transplantation were labeled with 
a contrasting agent containting iron ox
ide. High-contrast spots on an MRI scan 
indicated accumulations of immune cells 
attacking the foreign tissue.
This research has received funding 
from institutions including the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the 
National Institute of Biomedical Imag
ing and Bioengineering; the Health Re
search Formula Funds of the Pennsylva
nia Commonwealth University Research
Enhancement Tobacco Settlement; and 
the National Center for Research Re
sources.
Ho and his team plan to continue their 
study with larger animals. Since their approach is very new, much testing must 
still be done before this procedure can 
be performed on humans. But when the 
lives of thousands of transplant patients 
are at stake, its all worth it.

get yourself in a whole lot of trouble. For 
example, being in the basement helps, 
but for a large nuclear weapon, if youre 
closer than 10 kilometers from the blast 
site, youll be fried within the hour.
Basement shelters are on every para
noid persons mind, but would they be of 
any use? Florig intends to compare the 
costs and benefits of a variety of protec
tive actions and critically evaluate ad
vice to the public from various govern
ment agencies on what to do in a nuclear 
emergency. Florig claims that the odds 
of a nuclear shelter being effectively used 
within 10 years of being built is one in 
7000, assuming that the chance of a ra
diation emergency occurring in the U.S. 
in the next 10 years is one in five. Dont 
go on a duct-tape spree just yet.
Other projects being funded are just 
as critical. For example, in the 9/11 
Commission report one can find the 
horror story of firefighters in the North 
Tower. Unaware that the South Tower 
had collapsed, Fire Department of New 
York (FDNY) personnel continued to 
facilitate the evacuation of civilians long 
after the order to abandon the North
Tower had been, broadcast. Although 
the NYPD heard the warning,. many 
firefighters did not, due to faulty radios. 
The FDNY lost 343 firefighters that day, 
the largest loss of life of any emergency 
response agency in history. The fact that 
this tragedy could have been avoided 
angered many Americans, including EPP 
professor John Peha.
I was horrified to learn about the fire
fighters who never received the order to 
evacuate the North Tower of the World 
Trade Center. One hundred twenty-one 
firefighters were still in the tower when 
it collapsed. None survived. We can and 
must do better.
The tragic 9/11 report inspired Peha to 
investigate emergency communication 
systems in the United States. What Peha 
learned was disturbing: The American 
system is unnecessarily prone to fail
ure, inefficient, and expensive, thanks 
to outdated technology and ineffective 
policy. Although some analysts predict 
that radio spectrum will run out by the 
year 2010, Peha believes that with better 
technology and smarter policy, the issue 
can be avoided.
The fundamental problem is that 
communications is a local issue. We need

misinformation contributes to the 
need for education and re-education, Davis said.
Education about HIV/AIDS 
treatments was on the agenda 
for the evening. Dr. David Piontkowsky, an infectious diseases 
specialist working at the Positive 
Health Clinic, described antiret
roviral therapies so effective that 
in the past year [their clinic] has 
had no people die from HIV, with 
treatment.
HIV is a tricky foe to develop a 
cure for due to its modus operandi 
in the body. HIV is a retrovirus, 
which means that it can copy and 
paste its own genetic material 
into a hosts genome. Thus, the 
host unwittingly begins to manu
facture the HIV proteins that de
stroy cells of the bodys immune 
system. An infected person easily 
falls prey to diseases like pneumo
nia, which, though curable in a 
healthy person, are potentially fa
tal for people with weak immune 
systems.
However, there are several 
treatments on the market that 
keep HIV under control. Some 
work to prevent membrane fusion 
between the virus and host cells. 
In this way, the HIV viral genome 
has no opportunity to make DNA 
from its RNA. Other drugs substi
tute fake nucleotides, the building 
blocks for DNA and RNA, for real 
ones so that no functional viral 
proteins can be made.
Antiretroviral drugs are effec
tive when taken regularly. The
microscopy was also used to 
determine if DNA had attached 
to the nanotube surfaces and 
was successfully matched to its 
complementary DNA. Normal, 
healthy DNA was fluorescently 
tagged, and when it binds [to the 
nanotube] it can be seen with a 
fluorescent microscope, said 
Star. The electronic signal of the 
normal and mutated DNA can 
be corroborated with the pres
ence or absence of a fluorescent 
signal.
The development of this type
of technology holds many prom
ises. This type of SWNT technol
ogy will enable the development 
of handheld devices that will 
enable home testing, which will 
eliminate the need for time-consuming visits to doctors requir
ing specialized equipment and 
techniques, said Star.
Stars research was supported 
in part by the National Science 
Foundations Small Business 
Innovation Research program.

about obtaining or paying for

could cause a patients infection 
to become drug-resistant.

Googles Chinese decision is unjust to users
To whom does the search engine owe allegiance: users or the government?
You wont find Jeff Wideners iconic 
picture of the man standing before tanks 
in Tiananmen Square in any Chinese 
Schoolbook. And as of last Tuesday, you 
wont find it on any link from Googles 
new Chinese portal, either.
Google has, after some deliberation, 
made the decision to censor its web 
search results in China, per the request 
of the Chinese government. The com
pany, which stands behind the motto 
Dont be evil, has gotten terrible press 
from people who think that complying 
with the Chinese government to keep 
curious Chinese citizens in the dark is 
just that  evil.
What Google has done is not unprec
edented, and sadly, it is not even surpris
ing. Other search engines fell in line with 
censorship on their Chinese sites months 
ago. Reporters Without Borders claimed 
that Googles rival engine Yahoo actu
ally aided the Chinese with information 
leading to the conviction of Shi Tao, a 
Chinese journalist accused of sharing 
government secrets. If thats the case, 
Yahoo is not only censoring results, but 
also aiding and abetting the Chinese 
government in its hunt for political 
dissidents.
This move to censor happened just 
after Googles decision to fight U.S. subpoenas for information about Google 
search terms. It took little time for the 
privacy debate to launch after Google 
said it wouldnt give up its terms to 
the U.S. government. But dont thank 
Google for protecting your rights yet. 
Rather than privacy, Google is actually 
fighting to protect trade secrets. In 
reference to the privacy issue, a lawyer 
for the American Civil Liberties Union 
said, We will probably not be making 
that argument.
What Google seems to stand for is 
greed. Though privacy became the rally
ing call for pro-Google statements in the 
American case, in reality, Google just has 
a case of the gimmes.
When the chips were down and the 
stakes on market shares were high, 
Google looked the other way. The deci
sion to censor in China is exactly the 
opposite of Googles stated mission. It 
prevents information from flowing freely. 
Some might argue that it is unlawful for 
Google not to comply with the Chinese 
laws on censorship, but Googles first 
commitment should be to users, and in 
this case, those users rights are being 
ignored. Google itself essentially said 
that last year when it bought five percent 
of the shares in AOL. Providing a great 
search is the core of what we do, it said.
How great is the search that ignores en
tire sections of history?
Others would say that Google is show
ing more to the Chinese than other 
search engines in China, and should be 
applauded. Google.cn (the new portals 
address) is supposed to show Chinese 
users what they are missing by show
ing the blocked site but not allowing 
users to access it. Microsoft and Yahoos 
Chinese versions merely block the con
tent. But just because Google gives its us
ers a chance to see what they are missing 
doesnt make it right. If a librarian lets 
us glance at the cover of The Communist 
Manifesto, is that supposed to make 
us feel better when she locks it away 
again?
Google might try to say its back was 
against the wall and that this move 
makes good business sense. They might 
point fingers at the other search engines 
that have agreed to censor their content. 
But as every five-year-old knows, the 
line Everyone else was doing it never 
cuts it.
What sparks our anger is that Google 
would tout its value of giving a great 
search and lift high its moralistic motto 
about doing good. It is plain hypocrisy. 
The definition of evil  which includes 
censorship  knows no borders.
UPN + WB = WTF?
Two terrible networks set to become one shockingly awful network
Any mother can tell you: two wrongs 
dont make a right. Anyone who passed 
basic algebra can tell you: the sum of two 
negatives is never a positive.
Unfortunately, it appears that execu
tives at CBS and Warner Bros, are nei
ther mothers nor mathematicians. They 
recently announced that starting this 
September, theyre combining their noto
riously unsuccessful networks, UPN and 
the WB. This merger of mediocrity is like 
a bizarre reality show in itself. Can two 
very different (but equally stale) pro
gramming line-ups learn to live together 
under one networks roof?
For the record, neither network has 
ever been financially successful. The WB 
got a whiff of profit in only a small 
handful of its 11 years, and CBS chief 
executive Leslie Moonves is quoted in 
The New York Times as saying that UPN 
executives were approaching the point 
where they were getting close to hop
ing to break even.
Maybe the new network, the CW (no, 
seriously: an amalgam of the letters in 
CBS and WB), should try approaching
the point where theyre getting close to 
hoping to break out some quality pro
gramming. Just a suggestion.
Maybe, instead of a vapid parade of 
pretty teenagers, the WB can try giving 
those pouty lips something meaningful 
to say beyond Seventh Heavens brave 
preaching that racism is wrong, smoking 
is bad, school violence is totally uncool, 
and abstinence rules. (Either way, nei
ther Seventh Heaven nor the WB will 
ever by forgiven by the current genera
tion for launching the career of Ashlee 
Simpson.)
The point is, melodrama comes stan
dard with the teenage years, and this 
is one instance when we dont need art
 The Tartan uses the term loosely  to 
imitate life. We really dont need Dawson 
and Rory and a pubescent Clark Kent 
moping around along with them.
As for UPN, it deserves a modicum of 
credit for attempting to break the racial 
monotony (read: whiteness) that seems 
to have infected network television. UPN 
also deserves several modicums of dis
credit for doing a terrible job of develop
ing their diverse casts into decent TV. 
Does UPN really think that its largely 
African-American audience is satisfied 
by cultural caricature? Isnt it conde
scending to think that African-Americans 
are content to simply watch other 
African-Americans onscreen, rather than 
appreciate good writing and engaging 
characters as well?
This merger seems like a last-ditch 
attempt at profitability for each, network, 
and it exemplifies the increasing trend of 
cable channels domination over network 
television. Cable television, for the most 
part, has recently had enough faith in 
itself and respect for its viewers to pro
duce truly thoughtful programming, as 
evidenced by such award-winning shows 
as Sex and the City, The Shield, and Six 
Feet Under.
Until networks can lose the catchphrases, caricatures, and shtick which 
have defined their lackluster shows for 
decades, theyre doomed to low ratings, 
meager profits, ruthless mockery, gossip, 
backstabbing, teenage pregnancy, and 
sobbing into pillows.
Hamas Palestinian win raises 
the stakes in the Middle East
Ben Hackett
Democratic elections were held last 
week in the Palestinian territories in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The bad 
news: Hamas, a terrorist organization 
with a political wing, won the majority 
of the seats in the Palestinian parlia
ment. The good news: Ever the good 
sports, Hamas and Fatah continue to 
engage in democratic discourse... by 
shooting one another. All end-times rev
elry aside, let those interested in a study 
of Palestinian politics and the regional 
overtones be engaged.
Hamas, come on down! Youre the 
next contestant on What the Hell Were 
They Thinking? According to most 
accounts, Hamas was officially formed 
in late 1987. Since Hamas became a 
viable terrorist organization, it has car
ried out numerous attacks on Israeli 
citizens and Israeli interests throughout 
Israel and the disputed territories.
In the interest of fair reporting: 
Hamas does engage in its commu
nity. The organization spends a large 
percentage of its operating income on 
service programs in the Palestinian ter
ritories. However, being evil and mur
derous is never excused by good deeds 
later in life. (Isnt that right, Tookie?) 
According to U.S. Navy publications, 
Hamas maintains influence and opera
tives in the Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon, 
Iran, and the Gulf States.
Remember the debate about the 
Israeli pullout from the Gaza Strip? One 
of the major arguments used by those 
who were against that latest concession 
was that it would lead to the establish
ment of an Iranian- and Syrian-funded 
staging area for terrorism. Well, that 
theory has matured from probable to 
definite as Hamas, funded mostly by 
now-wealthy Palestinian expatriates 
and Iran, gained control of 76 of the 132 
Palestinian parliamentary seats.
There are two takes on the Palestinian 
elections. Both are correct. First, the 
Palestinians, upset with decades of 
Fatah corruption, voted for the alterna
tive, regardless of what that alternative 
was. Second, the results of the elec
tion represent a choice made by the 
Palestinian voters stating emphatically 
that peace with Israel is secondary to 
other political goals. I hasten to write 
that these other goals are not necessar
ily the destruction of Israel (which is 
stated Hamas policy), but may reflect 
more on the promises made by Hamas 
during the election cycle to help build 
services and infrastructure within the 
Palestinian territories.
Again, these seemingly benevolent
promises do not excuse Hamas from 
being called exactly what it is: a terror
ist organization with a political wing. 
Israel, the EU, and the U.S. are absolute
ly justified in demanding that Hamas 
cease its terrorist activities before it can 
be considered a viable peace partner. 
This is not Western bullying; this is a 
common-sense approach designed to 
achieve lasting results.
The more disturbing item found in 
this latest turn of Middle Eastern events 
is the apparent squandering of the his
toric democratic Palestinian elections.
All nations (excepting a soon-tobe nuclear Iran with the same goal as 
Hamas  the destruction of Israel) are 
wary of the Palestinian voters choice. 
Stepping back from the international 
lens, it is more easily understood on a 
local level. The Palestinians are a group 
which has become an excuse for, more 
than a concern of, the Arab nations 
for many years. A homeless tribe that 
has been uprooted, moved around, and 
generally discarded by their neighbors 
 Israeli, Western, and Arab alike.
As such, one can imagine how they 
might feel frustrated, and thus vent 
their frustration by removing a corrupt 
government that acted as the overseer 
for years of misfortune. Unfortunately, 
the installation of a government openly 
hostile to their closest neighbor  their 
strongest neighbor  was a mistake 
with potentially disastrous results for 
the Palestinian people.
I wrote an article back in September 
2005 addressing the new rights and 
responsibilities of the Palestinian 
people, once afforded their own terri
tory. One should place this situation in 
the context of an established Palestinian 
state. With biblical claims [put] aside 
in favor of progressive solutions to land 
claims, and the question of borders 
answered, citizens could begin to build 
their lives instead of fighting an occu
pying force. With the two-state solution 
in full effect, Palestinian leadership and 
citizenry would have more to lose if vio
lence continued. This position remains 
unchanged and has been vindicated as a 
viable concern.
Today the Palestinians are a people 
whose borders are finally beginning to 
be defined. They are a people that just 
had a historic democratic election. They 
are a people with a glimmer of hope for 
the future for the first time in decades. 
However, the responsibilities associated 
with statehood and democracy cannot 
continue to be ignored. It is time for 
responsible leadership in the region to 
think about the future with the same 
passion with which it addresses the 
problems of the present.

Understanding 
academic rights

__________________Tom Sabram
As Carnegie Mellon students, 
you are some of the most intelli
gent people in college at this time. 
However, due to the challenging 
nature of this university, time 
is a most precious commodity. 
Imagine now that you are sitting 
in a history or English class and 
you are handed back a paper in 
which you argued a point that 
the instructor doesnt agree with. 
You used numerous credible 
sources to back up your thought
ful and well-written paper; nev
ertheless, you feel your grade 
was based on the instructors 
beliefs, not the course criteria. 
What would you do?
Personally, I would begin by 
asking the instructor about the 
grade, and if that answer was 
unsatisfactory, I would then fol
low the policies set forth in The 
Word to challenge the validity of 
the grade received.
This scenario would fall under 
the proposed amendment to the 
Student Rights Policy, which is 
found in The Word, Carnegie 
Mellon students guide to the 
Universitys policies. The amend
ment currently reads: The third 
right of students is to be evaluat
ed based on stated course criteria 
and appropriate knowledge of 
the subjects and disciplines they 
study. I have seen this propos
al take various forms and have 
been around many discussions 
since its introduction during the 
middle of last semester.
I have struggled unsuccess
fully to see the necessity of this 
amendment for two reasons: 
firsly, I feel it is obvious to any 
student that he or she has the 
right to be evaluated based on 
his or her knowledge of a giv
en subject. Secondly, the policy 
already includes the right for 
recourse against unreasonable 
academic action.
As this amendment created by 
the Academic Affairs Committee 
of the Undergraduate Student 
Senate follows the process to 
become part of the policy, there 
will be plenty of discussion about 
it from the Graduate Student 
Assembly, the Faculty Senate, 
and the Undergraduate Student 
Senate. Granted, this is a great 
process, as feedback is received 
from at least three bodies, all of 
which have unique populations, 
but this is where my concern 
arises. I feel all students need to 
hear about this and be given the 
chance to express their opinions 
about it, since there have been 
claims of student support for this 
policy. There was a forum on this 
topic last semester, but it took 
place on a Friday afternoon and 
was sparsely attended.
Until there is more student 
input on a policy that will affect 
all students, I will make sure all 
relevant bodies know about the 
lack of input and call the neces
sity of the amendment into ques
tion.

Pittsburghs charm lies in its unpretentious character
(XkQ#oV Alexandr;Alexandra Kilduff
Greetings from the nations 
capital.
Just in case you were dying 
to know, I am spending a se
mester at American University 
in Washington, D.C. For the 
spring of 2006 I can hone my 
skills at saving the world (read: 
non-profit management) with 
the cream of the public policy 
crop in this buzzing, bustling, 
international city, as Americans 
website calls my current home. 
A city where there are only two 
lifestyle speeds, impossibly fast 
and impossibly faster, it gushes. 
Visit our exciting neighborhoods 
for a real taste of Americas home 
town, urges the D.C. Chamber 
of Commerce. Even my handy 
Not for Tourists Guide, whose 
writers often employ irrever
ent humor at the expense of the 
destinations theyre describing, 
describes this city the most pow
erful  and one of the most 
dynamic  in the world.
I miss Pittsburgh like crazy.
Dont get me wrong, Im having 
ai great time here. It is bustling, it 
is dynamic, and there are plenty 
of fascinating things to look at. 
I assure you that there is more 
to Washington than giant phallic 
monuments and the Smithsonian. 
Furthermore, the program I am 
involved in encourages me to ex
plore and work with neighbor
hoods in D.C. that, while not as 
key as Capitol Hill or as glamor
ous as Georgetown, are certainly 
just as interesting.
But consider this (very) brief 
history lesson. D.C. was once 
known, for better or for worse, 
as the Chocolate City, thanks 
to its majority African-American 
population. It was thus home to 
a thriving and interesting black 
cultural scene. It also housed
diehard Redskins fans and rising 
numbers of immigrants, as well 
as the President. True, at some 
point in the recent past it might 
also have also been the murder 
capital of the nation (a reputa
tion that has long outlasted fact), 
but it had a character all its own.
Today, most D.C. residents are 
transplants from somewhere else. 
They move to the rapidly spread
ing suburbs or push long-time 
residents out of their neighbor
hoods so they can snap up milliondollar townhouses. Following in 
the wake of this lightning-fast 
gentrification are staggeringly 
high real-estate prices, tree-lined 
avenues, snazzy nightclubs, tapas 
bars, and Whole Foods super
markets. But at what price? From 
what Ive seen and heard so far, 
D.C. is marginalizing a lot of its 
own citizens, and losing some of 
its soul in the process. Imagine, if 
you will, an entire city transform
ing into Shadyside, but with less 
parking and more congressional 
staffers.
Here is where Pittsburgh en
ters the picture. I am not even 
going to pretend that Pittsburgh 
has a better theater, nightclub, or 
restaurant scene going for it than 
D.C., nor am I going to claim that 
it is as bustling or dynamic. 
You will not rub shoulders with 
your Senator in a swanky steakhouse in Pittsburgh, nor will 
you find protestors riding the 
sparkling-clean subway system 
to go demonstrate in front of 
the White House. Glamour and 
power go hand in hand, and 
Pittsburgh is in somewhat short 
supply of both.
But thats exactly what makes 
it so appealing. Pittsburghers 
are proud of who they are, or 
at the very least, what they rep
resent: no-nonsense, unpreten
tious citizens, generally from a 
blue-collar background, who 
have managed to preserve ethnic 
traditions and local loyalties to a 
degree not found in many other
cities. Pittsburgh holds on firmly 
and naturally to its history. Look 
at the robber-baron mansions 
in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. 
Venture into neighborhoods like 
Bloomfield, where little Italian 
nuns still sweep the sidewalks 
in front of churches. Go poke 
around streets with row houses 
and back alleys straight out of a 
turn-of-the-century photograph, 
where time has stood so still that 
people still drive cars theyve 
owned for 30 years. Theres a rea
son production companies like to 
film period movies in the Burgh 
 parts of it look like a giant, liv
ing film noir set.
Maybe Im waxing a little too 
nostalgic. After all, Pittsburgh 
has some less appealing history
to deal with, including tense 
racial and labor relations. And 
yes, chances are it will lose a 
lot of its old-fashioned flavor as 
the older generation is replaced 
by a new one. But change can 
be celebrated too, whether its 
in the form of a new arts com
munity in Lawrenceville or in 
tech-sawy establishments at the 
rivers edge. Somehow, transfor
mation in Pittsburgh feels un
conscious, gradual, and organic. 
There might be a Whole Foods 
now, but that hasnt changed the 
fact that Pittsburgh is one of the 
few places you can eat an arteryclogging pastrami sandwich and 
feel like youve done something 
culturally significant. And seri
ously, where else would an entire
udiiiciic oduuiiiu/uubbtcr Literary naiior
municipality change its name to 
that of its favorite football team?
So, Pittsburgh, consider this 
an early Valentine. You may have 
your faults and foibles, you may 
be a little grimy compared to 
the gleaming white District of 
Columbia, but youre not afraid 
to be yourself. And when I return 
next fall, I can rest easy knowing 
youll still be the same.

said that he too has to touch things with 
both side of his body. Its hard to resist, 
he said. I mean if this hand touches 
something, the other one has to, too. Why 
should it be mistreated? Why, indeed?
Im not implying that CMU is starting to 
admit students from mental wards, nor I 
am saying that all of my friends have OCD. 
We throw that term around like its candy. 
I constantly hear: God, youre so OCD! 
Aside from the fact that it uses a proper 
noun as a modifier, that is most likely a 
grossly inaccurate statement. OCD is a 
very serious disorder, in which obsessions 
and compulsions become the focus of a 
persons life, in some cases consuming him 
or her to the point where normal function
ing is barely possible. No; what I am talk
ing about are common idiosyncrasies.
The online encyclopedia Wikipedia has 
something to say on the subject of what 
is and isnt OCD: The phrase obsessivecompulsive has 
worked its way 
into the wider 
English lexicon, 
and is often 
used incorrectly 
in an offhand 
sense to describe 
someone who is 
meticulous or absorbed.... A person who 
shows signs of infatuation or fixation with 
a subject/object, or displays traits such as 
perfectionism, is not necessarily stricken 
with OCD, a specific and well-defined 
disorder.
Okay, thats good to know, but are 
individuals prone to certain actions or 
procedures stricken with OCD? I dont
think so. The people who show these weird 
traits like eating food in even numbers or 
having to touch surfaces with both sides of 
their bodies are some of the most  to use 
the words of Wikipedia  meticulous and 
absorbed people I know. They get good 
grades, study regularly, and participate 
in clubs and organizations. They are, in 
short, perfectly normal, despite the fact 
that, well, they really arent normal at all.
Internationally renowned modern art
ist Jonothan Borofsky used to obsessively 
count and write down numbers. One of 
his most famous pieces of art is a stack 
of papers on which he handwrote all the 
numbers from 1 to 3,227,146 (its three 
feet tall). Now he has sculptures and art 
installations in every major city on Earth 
and soon his artwork will be installed on 
our campus. Why should you care about 
Borofsky? Because he went to CMU, just 
like you, and his obsession made him one 
of the worlds foremost 
modern artists.
Im not saying that 
Im the next Borofsky 
because I obsessively 
clean my sink, but I 
dont think its wrong 
that the minds of 
certain people cause 
them to do unusual things. Im not the 
only one who thinks so, either. A recent 
article in The New York Times Health and 
Fitness section announced the arrival of a 
new guidebook to the field of psychology, 
The new book, unveiled by the American 
Psychoanalytic Association, puts emphasis 
on individual personality patterns which 
can only be construed as disorders in exI dont think its wrong

people cause them to do 
unusual things.
treme cases. Basically, the idea is to find 
out whats really going on in someones 
mind and why before automatically di
agnosing him or her with a disorder. I 
think its a big step forward to seek out 
the underlying causes of certain behaviors 
instead of taking them at face value.
I think the reason I see weird stuff in 
myself, my friends, and others on campus 
is that the students here are so focused on 
the innumerable facets of their lives that 
some of their mental energy is unleashed 
in peculiar ways. A combination of unique 
personalities, strong work ethics, intense 
pressure, and extreme stress manifests 
itself in the form of habits and quirks that 
resemble obsessions and compulsions. For 
me, obsessive cleanliness and a fixation 
on hygiene helps me deal with stress and 
keeps me from getting too wrapped up in 
frivolous pursuits like homework and 
going to class.
I wish I could take it easy and be cool 
in any situation. I am envious of people 
who sit still for long periods of time and 
dont fidget or show any sign of even the 
slightest idiosyncracy. Id like to be that 
chill, down-to-earth person that doesnt 
have a care in the world, who probably 
couldnt even spell obsession (if he even 
knew what it meant). But frankly, thats 
just not normal.

you need to contact him, he will be clean

I watched MTV a lot over winter break, 
which, in retrospect, was very unhealthy. 
I wanted to keep channel surfing, but 
like an accident on the side of the high
way, the prospect of something appalling 
was too much to resist. And appalled I 
was: scantily clad coeds, jackasses diving 
off cliffs, mean-spirited practical jokes, 
SuChin Pak, the whole bit. There was 
one show, however, that appalled me for 
a different reason. I was watching True 
Life: I Have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. 
For those of you who dont watch the 
Music Television, True Life is one of the 
better shows on the channel. Of all the 
fake reality they put out, True Life is the 
least fake. Anyway, I started to get wor
ried as three people with OCD started to 
explain their obsessions and compulsions. 
Most were extremely distinctive, but oth
ers were things that some my friends and I 
do on a regular basis: having to eat certain 
foods in even numbers, having to. brush 
your teeth with a regular procedure, or 
having to touch surfaces with both sides 
of the body.
Do we have OCD?
Everyone who goes to CMU soon real
izes that the students here are all eccentric 
(some more than others), but until now I 
did not realize how many of us are moved 
daily by compulsions and obsessions. Even 
as I sat discussing this article with the 
lounge rats on my floor, my friend Joey

A penny saved...
Bargain Steeler Card helps charities and you
Beginning Wednesday, the purchase of a single 
card will allow students to support devastated 
areas while also getting good deals at local shops. 
Thats right: the good deals are yours. I'm talking 
to those of you who might not have the money to 
buy your sweetie flowers, eat out at a restaurant, 
or just order pizza. Discounts and deals on top of 
charity? It doesnt get much better than this.
Its no surprise that college students these days 
are reaching extra deep into their pockets for 
change. Money comes 
and goes... and goes... 
and goes. The $40,000 
cost of attendance and 
$450 bag of books leave 
students dry. Movies 
this weekend? Forget 
it. And a college kids 
got to eat. While meal 
plans are the "freshman 
thing, eating at Schatz 
night and day can 
definitely get old.
With students money tied up in such things, 
the rattling cans and waving signs on campus 
pleading for donations are often bypassed.
Sure, its all for worthy causesHurricane 
Katrina cleanup efforts, Habitat for Humanity, 
and Rotoract fundraisersbut its hard when 
moneys tight. At the same time, its undeniable 
that areas devastated by the South Indian tidal 
wave, Hurricane Katrina, and the India-Pakistan 
earthquake need our help.
So what's the solution?
Sophomore Sean J. Weinstock and junior 
Shabnam Aggarwal think theyve got it. At a 
mere $5 per student, the Bargain Steeler Card 
offers discounts at local food shops ranging from 
Papa Johns to Ben and Jerrys Ice Cream. The 
best part is that proceeds go to disaster relief 
efforts. The ultimate goal is to raise $10,000.
It all started with a desire to help. Weinstock 
said, "There is a huge need for aid and support 
in whichever form it can come, [so] Shabnam 
Aggarwal and I decided that we should somehow 
try and help. Charity considerations include the 
Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity.
The card helps students as well  it is mainly 
geared toward providing students with more food 
options. That's the best way to help out students, 
thinks Weinstock.
More food variety is an appealing prospect. While 
DineXtra is a nice idea, it just doesnt cut it for 
some. "It really makes your options limited, as 
it only works for two pizza places, first-year Tom 
Walko pointed out. This is really a shame when, 
as Walko said, much of students money goes to
Discounts and deals 
on top of charity?
It doesnt get much 
better than this.
outside vendors. He added that he would need to 
see the bargains, though, before purchasing the 
card.'
In addition to Papa John's and Ben and Jerrys, 
the Bargain Steeler Card offers discounts at 
popular places like Quiznos, Pittsburgh Deli, and 
Bombay Grill, among myriad other options.
The project is also motivated by student opinion. 
According to Weinstock, a November survey 
asked students 
if they would be 
willing to pay 
a small fee for 
local discounts.
The survey got a 
positive response, 
which will be put 
to the test when 
the cards come out 
in just a few days.
Hopefully, even 
those students who arent feeling pressed for 
money will contribute $5 to the cause. Saving 
money is hard to pass up. As first-year Han Kim 
pointed out, "If I can save my money, why not?" 
Kim admits that although he's not scrounging 
around for change, "saving money is a good habit 
to have, adding, "if it is for goodwill... Ill really 
consider buying it.
Although cards expire August 27, Weinstock 
hopes, to make it a two-semester deal next year.
In addition, he foresees sales expanding to 
other campuses, including those of Point Park 
University, the University of Pittsburgh, and 
Carlow University.
To pick up a card, go to the first floor of the 
University Center Wednesday through Friday. 
After Friday, the Information Desk will have the 
cards available.
The bottom line: If you're looking to save money, 
why not help others in the process? "Its just a 
way to give back to those who were generous 
enough to donate, Weinstock said.

The Tartan printed a blazing editorial criticizing its 
detractors. Among the complaints students har
bored about the newspaper were that it printed 
editorials on nothing but feeble subjects. Feeble 
subjects like wasting an entire column whining 
about how no one likes the poor little Tartan?
A columnist for The Tartan wrote about the trials 
and tribulations of living, quite platonically, with 
two female roommates. He complained that when 
God designed females, he gave them extremely 
powerful muscles in their jaws, and they feel 
compelled to exercise them often. He also noted 
that they seem obliged to tell me how fat they 
are  every five minutes." Now there's a way to 
make your living arrangements .more comfortable: 
Complain  in bold type  to the entire student 
body about how annoying your roomies are.
A toxic chemical leak led to the total evacuation of 
Wean Hall. A container of hydrogen sulfide was the 
cause; at 8:30 am a staffer noticed the foul odor 
and alerted Campus Police. However, The Tartan 
reported that some people were still in Wean at
10 am, proving once again that we can program 
in any condition. Toxic waste, rotting food... bring 
it on.
Carnegie Mellon unveiled its master plan for what 
the campus would look like in the future. Additions 
included new dormitories and underground park
ing garages. Sadly, The Tartan failed to mention 
world domination as part of Carnegie Mellons socalled master plan.
The robot QRIO was unveiled at Carnegie Mellon 
and was an instant crowd pleaser. It said that the 
weather in Pittsburgh was freezing and performed 
some great dance moves. The Tartan wrote that a 
pair of QRIOs drew upon a repertoire of boy-band 
moves and pelvic thrusts to perform a series of ... 
pop dances." And in that moment we proved both 
that all boy bands are robots and that Id have bet
ter luck with men if I stuck to dating automatons.

Write a book! These students did
Whether its a simple haiku, an academic dissertation, or a novel, this guide can help
How do you write a book? In an attempt to answer this 
question, I interviewed three Carnegie Mellon students who 
know a bit about the subject.
I talked to Colin Liotta, a junior English major, who wrote a 
childrens novel called Boy Werewolf last year, and is currently 
working on the next book in the series. I spoke with Andy 
Butler, a senior and the CA of Global Studies and Forbes 
Houses, who raised some eyebrows last year when he wrote 
New House 5, a fictionalized account of a year in CMUs 
newest dorm. I also interviewed Kristan Hoffman, a junior 
creative writing major. Though Liotta and Butler are both 
published authors, neither of them has taken many creative 
writing classes. From these interviews, Ive created a guide 
for you, the aspiring author. Heres what to do:
Be inspired
Liotta let his favorite collection of books, the Harry Potter 
series, drive him to create a similar body of work. That's a
good start, but eventually every writer must develop a distinct 
style. Imitation may be flattery at its best, but it's not favored 
in the literary world. Liotta admitted that some publishers 
have worried that the premise of his new series is too much 
like a story J.K. Rowling might write. Liotta said you have to 
separate yourself" from the authors you admire.
Real events can also serve as inspiration. When Butler applied 
to be an RA for the fifth floor of New House, he didnt expect 
that the experiences he would share with his floormates 
would inspire him to write a book. When he did decide to 
write about the friendships and drama of his sophomore year, 
he realized that the goal of his book would be to prepare high 
school students and their parents for the phenomenon that is 
dorm life. Butler kept this mission in mind while writing New 
House 5, and it helped to motivate him along the way.
In addition, all CMU students share a common source of 
inspiration: our classes. Im not talking about'the professional 
or creative writing courses meant to train writers, but rather
the ones that may seem irrelevant in the world of prose: 
Matter and Interaction, Concepts of Math, Organic Chemistry.
"I think that the other classes I take stimulate my brain, said 
Hoffman. She recalled a past semester when almost all of her 
classes were English-oriented  it was unchallenging and, 
as a result, uninspiring. Hoffman added, "You have to have 
something to write about." Some of the most moving works 
of art have scientific premises, but even if science is not 
relevant to your work of fiction, learning about it keeps your 
mind open.
Finding what works
Liotta has already written two books out of a planned six, but 
when I asked him if he knew how book number six would 
end, he shrugged his shoulders. He said he likes to avoid 
planning; otherwise his series would, in his words, feel like 
a homework assignment." In fact, part of what Liotta loves 
about writing is watching the plot of his story continue to

grow and change with the addition of new characters and . 
events.
Liotta makes a case for unstructured writing, but it doesnt 
work for everyone. In fact, one of the first things that Butler 
did when he decided to write New House 5 was to make an 
outline for the entire book. He said that it helped to break 
it down" into chapters and occurrences, to make the project 
seem a little less overwhelming.
By the time I got to ask Hoffman how she prefers to write, I 
was more than a little confused. Apparently when it comes to 
prose there are no easy answers. She said that "personality 
types" play a huge role in how people write. Friends with both 
Liotta and Butler, Hoffman laughed when I told her how each 
of them write. She explained that knowing their personalities, 
my findings were hardly surprising. There is no correct way, 
Hoffman added, and told me that her methods are somewhere 
in between Liotta's spontaneity and Butlers meticulous 
preparation.
Every writer is different, but there are a few tips that seem 
to be universal. Liotta told me it is important to pick an idea 
you won't get sick of writing about, and then devote yourself 
to it. Liotta sacrificed many a college weekend while writing 
Boy Werewolf, and had to leam to ignore the skepticism of his 
friends. As he put it, writing should be something "separate 
from your social life."
Be confident
"You can't be intimidated," said Butler; you must believe that 
what you are working on is worth the time and effort. Butler 
told me that he made himself work on New House 5 for an 
hour every night. Sometimes that hour would only yield two or 
three pages of text, but he refused to be discouraged. Another 
interesting tip I learned from Butler is that it is helpful to allow
at least a week between writing and revising. If you wait, you 
are more likely to spot passages that don't make sense.
Hoffman also stressed the importance of revision. Even four 
lines of a poem can be worked and reworked to perfection. 
Writing is rewarding and enjoyable, but on top of that, as 
Hoffman said frankly: It's work." She also recommended 
taking classes in all of the'branches of creative writing, even 
the ones that aren't suited to you. Hoffman doesn't plan on 
writing a lot of poetry in her future, but taking a class on it 
helped her leam a lot about imagery and symbolism.
The practical: the publisher
After you've managed to write the Great American Novel, 
youll need to know how to get it published. Upon finishing 
Boy Werewolf, Liotta looked for a publishing company the 
same way most of us would have done it: he used Google. He 
found Publish America, the same publisher that Butler wound 
up using for New House 5.
Butler said, "If you want to get published, you can. There are 
three categories of publishing companies:
Subsidy publishers will publish your book for a fee, but they 
wont edit or market it. There are also the big publishing 
companies such as Random House that will pay for the books 
they want. With this comes prestige and a professional level of 
editing and marketing, but in order to get their attention you 
will have to hire an agent. For his new series of books, Liotta 
is working with an agent to sell his fiction to such a company.
Finally, there are free publishers such as Publish America. 
These companies are eager to pick up new novelists, but 
they have their pitfalls. Publish America released Liottas Boy 
Werewolf before all of its errors had been corrected, and not . 
many people outside of Carnegie Mellon have heard of Butler's
New House 5 because of the limited marketing it received.
Hoffman suggested some other options. In CMU creative 
writing classes, teachers encourage their students to begin 
by submitting works of short fiction to magazines like The 
New Yorker. "Supposedly thats how you start out, Hoffman 
said. It has worked for a lot of authors, such as J.D. Salinger 
and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Another possibility is to take a 
fellowship, in which an academic institution pays you for a 
set amount of. time (usually around two years) to write a book.
Last pages
And while you are working to write and publish best-selling 
book, I urge you to appreciate the moments that will happen 
along the way. I asked both Liotta and Butler, When did it feel 
real? For both of them, one such moment was when they saw 
their books on Amazon.com. Liotta also said he realized that 
real people (as opposed to friends and family members) were 
actually buying his book when he heard he had two sales in 
the UK. Butler told me that reality first hit him when he saw 
the cover design for New House 5. As soon as he saw it, he 
thought, "This is a real book."

Headhunters headline at Mr. Smalls
New members and an old-school sound bring jazz, funk and African music to Pittsburgh
6pillbox 1.30.06
Justin Brown | Assistant Photo Editor
Im standing in a smoky Pittsburgh rock venue with my eyes 
fixed on the stage. One of the biggest groups in jazz  The 
Headhunters  is sitting up there, ready to play what will 
be a mind-blowing, ass-shaking set of funk, jazz, and African 
music. Theres just one problem: the percussionist is blowing 
on a beer bottle. Unlike your average physics teacher who 
blows random pitches on a glass bottle during lecture, or kids 
who blow on Coke bottles at the dinner table to tick off their 
parents, percussionist Bill Summers was actually laying down 
a beat out of a half-empty vHeineken.
The night seemed to be defined by this opening moment of 
the show, a defiance of what jazz and "funk" music could 
be. The Headhunters, a group that started with jazz legend 
Herbie Hancock as bandleader and keyboardist in the early 
70s, are known for their ability to fuse elements of Sly Stone 
funk, Miles Davis jazz, and traditional African rhythms into a 
groove-heavy yet harmonically-captivating musical experi
ence.
Although the group has gone through multiple band member 
switches over the past 30 years, they are once again starting 
to settle down with their new lineup. "Conceptually, the music 
is no different, said percussionist (and only original Head
hunters band member) Bill Summers in a phone interview.
We play the melodies like they were on the records, but were 
trying to explore new territories." Summers is pleased with 
the product that has been created from the unique flavors and 
styles the musicians bring to the plate. [Saxophonist] Donald 
[HarrisonI, [bassist] George [Porter, Jr.] and I are all from New 
Orleans, so were able to represent cultures and styles that 
most jazz groups cant.
You could tell from the opening notes of Watermelon Man
- an old-school Headhunters tune off their first record  that
the Headhunters are really something special. Porter, who 
used to play in the New Orleans funk group The Meters, has 
an uncanny ability to lock into grooves with drummer Mike 
Clark. "It's all about pocket," Porter said after the show. It 
doesnt matter what kind of chops you got. If you cant lock 
into a groove, your chops dont mean anything." What set the 
rhythm section apart from most was the ability to balance out 
the grooves with their phenomenal technique and soloing 
ability. Porter, who calls himself a disgruntled guitar player 
who never really practiced bass," took melodically and rhyth
mically complex solos that never held the groove down and 
showcased his chops.
Were gonna take it back so we can take it forward. This 
song was written before most of you were even bom!  The 
opening notes of Sly"  an old Headhunters tune writ
ten for funk legend Sly Stone  broke through the PA as 
alto saxophone god Harrison played smooth lines and key
boardist Jerry Z laid down funky and ethereal textures with 
his organ and clavinet.
With three members of the group from Nawlins, a tribute 
to the fallen city was inevitable. Unlike most somber and 
Debbie-downer tributes, however, the group made sure to 
make theirs an energetic and uplifting one. The group played 
"Welcome to New Orleans, a simple-yet-funky tune that kept 
the crowd dancing and smiling. Donald Harrison stepped up 
with his saxophone and, with his eyes squinting and his face 
scrunching, undoubtedly played his most passionate and 
finest solo of the evening. Summers picked up where Harrison 
left off, playing a well-deserved percussion solo that showed 
the audience what real virtuosic percussion was all about.
Toward the end of Sly, I looked down to write a few notes, 
and by the time I looked back up, Summers had picked up
a shaker and the bass and keyboards had dropped out. The 
group had seamlessly made their way into a tribal-based 
number with Harrison and Summers chanting away. Sum
mers, as usual, did an awesome job creatinga just enough 
color and texture with his percussion to add another layer to 
the music. Unlike many percussionists, he never overplayed 
or outdid the soloist.
When the bass and keyboards came back in, the group had 
eased into "Chameleon, possibly one of the most famous jazz/ 
funk numbers of all time, one that is still covered by jazz cats, 
rock bands, and even jambands. Porter once again laid down 
a funky bass line, while adding syncopations and fills that let 
the soloist know he wasn't just a machine. Drummer Clark 
pounded away behind the soloist and, although sometimes 
monotonous, never lost energy.
Since the theme of the night was groove," the show appro
priately ended with a loco-la-cabesa drum duel between Clark 
and Summers. The two would trade off taking eight-bars of 
flashy, virtuosic, and melodic solos that included 16th-note 
whirlwinds, blues shuffles, and hard rock head pounding.
"The legends and founders of jazz music are mostly gone," 
said Clark. It's up to the disciples to add to it and build on

Tailgate with a sports-movie marathon
Prep for the Super Bowl with ducks, Titans, gophers, and an egg
If no one has told you yet, the Pittsburgh Steelers are going 
to the Super Bowl. Super Bowl XL, to be exact (thats 40, for 
all you non-Romans). When I was a child I walked my central 
Florida neighborhood polling people on who they wanted to 
win Super Bowl XXX (30), the Steelers' last appearance in the 
big game. Now, as I watch them head toward the pinnacle of 
football glory, I feel like the players are brothers to me. Yep, 
huge, racially diverse, sweaty, hairy, 300-pound brothers.
In honor of this classic moment in Steeler history, Ive 
compiled for you a list of sports movies you might want to 
watch in preparation for this life-defining day... and a few 
movies you might want to skip.
Studs (Hines Ward, Big Ben, and the Flyin Hawaiian)
The Mighty Ducks: What does the phrase Quack, quack, 
quack, quack... conjure up in your mind? Thats right
 The Mighty Ducksl Yeah, I know that this article started 
off being about football, but the Steelers arent the only big 
name in sports news. Mario Lemieux just retired, also. So 
bust out the Ducks. Sure, in real life, Anaheim sucks. But
I have an absolutely crystal clear image of the one female 
player (Tammy) for the Ducks spinning rapidly around to 
discombobulate the opposing team. And come on, how often 
did you think of ducks as intimidating before this movie came 
out? Although it's got a ridiculous name, its no Angels in the 
Outfield, cause that movie seriously sucked.
Remember the Titans: It's easy to forget a few things about 
the nature of sports when your team is on a winning streak.
But Remember the Titaps reminds you that on a team, 
everyone has to work together to win. In this case the players' 
intra-team conflicts are extremely tense, as the school they 
play football for has just been racially integrated, and the team 
is now being coached by a black man. Denzel Washington 
plays Coach Herman Boone. This movie almost makes me 
overlook Washingtons later film follies, such as starring in the 
mediocre remake of The Manchurian Candidate.
Caddyshack: Bill Murray has stuck to more serious fare in 
recent years, but I have honestly never laughed so hard in 
my life as when I saw him playing golf with the geraniums. 
Utterly preposterous and pleasing. "This crowd has gone 
deadly silent, a Cinderella story outta nowhere." Thats all you 
need to know about Caddyshack. That and the fact that its 
the only time Rodney Dangerfield was actually funny.
A Big Dud (Mike Vanderjagt, wide right)
The Rookie: Ive done a lot for my friends over the years, 
but the most painful thing I did for a friend was watch this 
film. The Rookie does what few sports films can manage
 it actually induces belly-button-lint-picking boredom. For 
the record, I just can't stand Dennis Quaid. Its no offense 
to his personal character; I just havent liked any movie hes 
done. Not In Good Company (schmaltzy), not The Day After 
Tomorrow (ridiculous), and certainly not this film. For those of 
you that care, Quaid plays a guy who never made it past the 
minors because of a shoulder injury. He tries out for the major 
leagues years later after losing a bet. You can pretty much fill 
in the inspirational tale from there.
Good For a Few Giggles (Cincinnati Bengals, the Who 
Dey? Song)
Cool Runnings: Love it or hate it, you cant have a list of 
sports films without Cool Runnings. All kinds of hilarious 
happenings ensue when Jamaica enters the bobsled 
competition at the Olympics: And the story even has a heart
warming ending that isn't really predictable. An egg is a 
pivotal prop in this film  what could possibly go wrong?
Honorable Mentions (Antwaan Randle El, 
He[eeeee]ath Miller)
Rocky: Yo, don't let your life pass by without seeing this 
film. Sylvester Stallone is a big thug who defines the classic 
comeback role. And come on, Rocky HI brought us the fine 
tune "Eye of the Tiger." That alone should ensure the movie 
that started it all a spot on this list.
Field of Dreams: If you watch it, happiness will come. I like 
this film better than any other Kevin Costner has made. Thats 
right, it beat out Waterworld. The pivotal performance comes 
from James Earl Jones'. His speech about baseball can make 
me cry and I dont even care about the game.
Oh, and in case you forgot: GO STEELERS!

Waking Ned Devine
Wednesday, February 1 
10, 12
Kirk Jones, the man behind the 
new film Nanny McPhee, made this 
movie back in the day. Like, all the 
way back in 1998. Two old men, 
Jackie and Michael, find out that a 
member of their tiny town has won 
the lottery. The winnings? Almost 7 
million Irish pounds. The winner? No 
one knows the winner, Ned Devine. 
Eventually, Jackie and Michael 
find out Ned died from shock after 
finding out that he won the lottery. 
One of the old men pretends to be 
Ned to get the money, and chaos 
ensues as the two old men try to fool 
the Lotto man  easier said than 
done. Personally, it scared me away 
from small towns.
Hamlet
Thursday, February 2 
6, 10
Pre-Titanic, Kate Winslet was in 
other movies. Who knew? In this 
1996 version of Hamlet, Winslet is 
Ophelia, Hamlets ill-fated ex-love. 
Kenneth Branagh both directed the 
film and starred as (you guessed 
it) Hamlet in this version of the 
classic play. The title characters 
father is murdered by his uncle, 
who then goes on to marry his 
mother. Throughout the rest of the 
play  I mean, movie  Hamlet 
struggles with ideas like life, death, 
and murder. Not a light-hearted 
comedy. Personally, Im more of 
a fan of Mel Gibsons version, but 
that's because his overacting just 
gets to be plain funny.
Serenity
Friday, February 3 
7:30,10,12
This movie is about the aftermath 
of a galactic civil war. Malcolm 
Reynolds, a veteran of the 
war, has become a for-hire 
spaceship captain. His crew is as 
dysfunctional as any sitcom family, 
but they are loyal to the death.
He picks up two passengers:
Simon Tam, a doctor, and River, 
his telepathic sister. Apparently, 
theyre fleeing from a government 
group that experimented on Rivers 
brain. According to Roger Ebert, 
its an old-fashioned space opera. 
Directed and written by Joss 
Whedon, this movie stars Nathan 
Fillion and Gina Torres.
Wallace & Gromit
Saturday, February 4 
8, 10, 12
Its claymation! Wallace and Gromit, 
an owner-and-dog duo, have 
created their own pest-fighting 
team called Anti-Pesto. They 
humanely dispose of rabbits 
that invade their towns gardens. 
However, trouble ensues when they 
realize that a creature they call the 
were-rabbit has begun attacking 
the gardens. Featuring the vocal 
talents of Ralph Fiennes and 
Peter Sallis, this movie should be 
entertaining. Granted, claymation 
reached its high point with Gumby... 
but the movie might still be worth 
your time.
Super Bowl XL
Sunday, February 5 
5
AB has given us the great gift of the 
Steelers. Instead of showing the 
regularly scheduled feature film, we 
are going to get the football event 
of the year. Thats right kids, its the 
SUPER BOWL. In all caps because 
this year its bigger and better than 
ever. Forget the Rolling Stones, this 
is the year of the Steelers. Even if 
you dont like them, youd be hard 
pressed not to want them to do 
it for Jerome. So get your butt to 
McConomy and support the Black 
and Gold, baby.

Lie about drugs, and deal with the Big 0
James Freys million little lies cross line between fiction and nonfiction
We kick off our four years here at Carnegie Mellon with a 
hearty game of."Two Truths and a Lie. Usually the first per
son to go falls prey to saying something like I play soccer," 
and you're like commmmeeeee onnnnnn, and then someone 
else later will be like I lived in London," and everyone will be 
like wooooooooo," forgetting that so do 7 million other people.
Though hes probably never graced the Cut or sniffed the 
edifying stench of the Donner dumpsters, perhaps we should 
still give hot-button author James Frey an honorary CMU 
degree or something. After all, our favorite orientation fixture 
of divulged secrets and attempted prevarication has been an 
inspiration for his "memoir," A Million Little Pieces. The book 
is second only to Elie Wiesel's Night (a book whose validity 
you might not want to question in public) on the New Yoik 
Times Best Seller List.
Pretty good for a teal-tinted pack of lies.
When Oprah chose Frey's book to revive the manifesto of the 
month club shes formed for her comfortably upper-middleclass Sag-Harbor-wearin', Robert-Redford-admirin fans every
where, the crowned Queen of Chicago wasnt asking for this. 
Frey's book, a supposed tale of addiction and redemption, 
has produced more controversy than those ladies in mock 
turtlenecks can handle in just one monthly session.
When life-ruining website The Smoking Gun revealed that 
Frey's "memoirs" were actually embellished stories better left
in the fiction department, his publisher, Doubleday, stood by 
him.
Among Frey's changes: Well, it wasn't exactly 87 days he 
spent in jail, more like four... hours. And that bit about being 
a fugitive in three states? Um, I dont think Jesse James wore 
pleated khakis, Mr. Frey.
On Thursdays show, Oprah refuted her initial support for 
Frey, telling him she felt "duped" and "betrayed. Guess that 
means he didn't leave with a car.
But Freys rude awakening has done nothing to affect his 
royalties paycheck  the novel continues to rank among the 
nations bestsellers. I doubt the Barnes and Noble in Squirrel 
Hill has seen any change in the number of paperback copies 
occupying its top-selling shelves in the weeks surrounding 
the crusade against A Million Little Pieces.
This whole situation is reminiscent of a time not so long ago 
when Oprah tried to rescue an author from the depths of 
obscurity with her literal stamp of approval. That author, The 
Corrections' Jonathan Franzen, declined her offer to be in
cluded in her book club. Not wanting his readers to be merely 
mimicking a TV talk show host's tastes in reading his book, 
Franzen actually helped see his audience expand. Now he had 
two audiences: those who wanted to read his book because 
Oprah liked it, and those who wanted to read it because Fran
zen didnt like the 0. Where is the love?
Whether he remains on Oprahs contact list or not, Frey is still 
making millions by touting a book he originally pitched to his 
publisher Nan Talese as a work of fiction. Some may argue 
that he has successfully blurred the line between fiction and 
non-fiction, but all this euphemism means is either he's lived 
a pretty boring life or he's a cliche-whore of a writer using 
immoral tactics to share his story. Judging from his reaction to 
the allegations, its probably a little of both.
So Frey doesnt have what it takes to make it in the truthbased world of literature and reporting. Don't worry, James; 
people change careers all the time, and Im sure the Bush 
administration would love to have you.
If I were Frey, though, I wouldnt worry about sealing my next 
book deal or re-establishing my credibility in the publishing 
world. Id work on settling things with the Big Woman Up Top 
first. I mean, it's pretty bad when Oprah's pissed at you.

Facts of a geisha
The movie was true to the book, but the book may embellish history
Can any movie do justice to the book it is based on? While 
Hollywood script-writers seem to have a hard time following 
books' storylines accurately, the movie Memoirs-of a Geisha, 
based on the novel by Arthur Golden, comes pretty close.
Set in the heart of the Gion district of Japan, in Kyoto, the 
movie is able to capture the essence of Japan in the 1930s. 
Rob Marshall, a Carnegie Mellon University alum and director 
of Memoirs, does a spectacular job of depicting the world 
through the eyes of a geisha.
Both the book and the movie, however, continue to be 
surrounded by controversy. Whether its the fact that Chinese 
actors were used instead of Japanese actors, or the allegation 
that Golden misrepresented sacred rituals, Memoirs of a 
Geisha has been a much-debated topic.
A story like mine has never been told," begins Chiyo, a poor 
fishermans daughter. She is about to be sold into a life of 
servitude: the life of a geisha. The movie thereafter follows 
the struggles faced by Chiyo, renamed Sayuri, in her journey 
to become a geisha. The movie succeeds in stunning the 
audience with its opulent expression of 1930s Japan. Marshall 
fills the movie with vivid images and subtle yet powerful 
descriptions of Japanese culture. The intense score by John 
Williams and heart-rending cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma add to the 
soundtrack and help to make this a movie worth watching.
So the movie does justice to the book, but does the book do 
justice to the history it references? Both the book and the 
movie go to great lengths to convince the audience that 
geisha are, by Japanese tradition, artists and entertainers, 
but not sex objects. However, this image is contradicted 
when Sayuris virginity is sold to the highest bidder. In 
reality, mizuage  the sale of a debutante geisha's virginity
 is an unmentionable topic that real-life geisha would 
consider inappropriate to talk about in public. The inadequate 
depiction of this sacred ritual infuriated the geisha 
community of Japan.
In the course of researching for his book, Golden spoke 
to several geisha, including Mineko Iwasaki, whom he 
thanked profusely in his book. However, five years after the 
books publication, Iwasaki sued Golden for libel. According 
to Iwasaki, Golden had grossly misunderstood the rite of 
mizuage, which was merely a celebration of the coming of 
age of a geisha and not some auction of virginity, as depicted 
in Goldens book. Iwasaki went on to say that when a geisha 
came of age, she required new and costly kimonos and 
hairstyles. These things may have been financed by a patron, 
but the geisha's virginity was never for sale. While Iwasaki 
speaks with conviction, one wonders why it took her so long 
to object to Golden's book. And given this, could the rite of 
mizuage actually be what Golden claims it is?
It cannot be denied that both the movie and the book are 
exaggerated on many levels. Golden is the first to admit that 
he may have gotten a lot of the details wrong, and confesses 
that a book of facts would be unable to capture the nuances of 
the lives led by geisha. After all, it is a work of fiction.
In his lecture at Carnegie Lecture Hall last Monday, Golden 
helped to dispel some of the myths not only about his book 
but also about the lives of geisha. He said that he wanted to 
include as many facts of Japanese life as he could, and that 
in doing so he may have overlooked something important or 
included something not entirely correct. When asked about 
the controversy surrounding mizuage, Golden said that he 
had described it to the best of his ability on the basis of what 
the geisha told him. Golden did admit that mizuage was never 
actually discussed out loud. According to Golden, the only 
reason he has Sayuri and her mentor, Mameha, discuss it in 
the book is because he had no other way of relating the gist of 
the ritual to the audience. Golden refused to comment on the 
subject of the lawsuit against him.
As in most book-to-film transitions, the movie is'unable to 
depict some of the finer details not only of Sayuris character, 
but also of her life. In the book, Golden talks about many 
rites and rituals of a geishas life which are not included in 
the movie. Furthermore, the movie skims over the details of 
Sayuris childhood and does not convey the horror faced by 
geisha in their youth.
The misrepresentations in both the book and the movie 
cannot be avoided, but they do not stop anyone from 
enjoying the film. It should be taken for what it is: a woik 
of fiction, purely for entertainment purposes. Neither Rob 
Marshall nor Arthur Golden claims to be representing actual 
fact or historical events, so discrepancies may certainly 
be considered artistic license on their part. Even though 
it may not perfectly depict the life of a geisha, it builds for 
us an image of an alluring world that we would have never 
otherwise seen.

Desanctified churches get new life
Groups preserve the architecture of religious spaces with beer and art
[ by Matthew E. Campbell | Copy Staff ] Photos by Justin Brown | Assistant Photo Editor
Everybody knows the ubiquitous signs outside churches: 
schedules for Sunday services, inspirational quotes from the 
Bible, and advertisements for Saturday night bingo. Every 
once in a while, however, youll be startled at the sight of a 
sign that might read, Pittsburghs Finest Brew Pub since 
1996." How do religious spaces come to be rebuilt and 
redesigned for non-religious purposes?
In many areas of Pittsburgh, people have had to deal with 
changes resulting from the collapse of the steel industry. 
Communities and buildings are all affected; churches, too, 
have had to adapt. East Liberty, for example, has a rich 
religious history from the days when it was one of the largest 
cities in the state. Lawrenceville, in similar style, saw a 
mass exodus of much of its population. The various Catholic 
parishes' congregation sizes shrunk, and they were forced to 
consolidate. This is what happened to St. John the Baptist, 
built in 1902. Its tiny congregation, consisting mostly of 
elderly citizens, was unable to ensure the church's financial 
stability. As a result, the church was shut down in 1993 and 
put up for sale by the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh.
St. John the Baptist was purchased by a group of 
restaurateurs. On August 1,1996, St. John the Baptist Church 
became The Church Brew Works, a microbrewery and 
restaurant. Although the restaurant still receives a few calls 
every year criticizing the establishment of a microbrewery 
in a church, president Sean Csey said that that criticism 
has petered but. He said that the church had a for sale sign 
just like any other for sale sign. Casey paid $191,200 for the 
building, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The Church Brew Works restaurant was the first time that the 
Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh had sold one of its churches 
to a developer. Father Thomas J. Burke, parochial vicar of 
St. Paul Cathedral across from CMUs Software Engineering 
Institute, said, The diocese kind of got burned when the 
developer didn't remove the religious items."
The diocese had not removed many 
religious items from St. John the 
Baptist, anticipating that the 
developers would remove the items; 
however, many of the holy items are 
still on display at The Church Brew 
Works. Since then, the diocese 
has created a process 
for closing down
churches. In addition to the traditional farewell mass, the 
church that is shutting down will be desanctified. In Burke's 
words, It's no longer a church, its just a building. The 
diocese removes anyfreligious items like crosses, stainedglass windows, and the altar.
Many people in historical circles are actually grateful to 
Caseys group for purchasing the church and restoring it. 
"Weve [Pittsburgh] had an unfortunate history of knocking 
down beautiful buildings, Casey said. Weve done very 
little to change the building. We wanted to preserve the 
architecture, and historical societies appreciate that.
In fact, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks 
Foundation gave the church Historic Landmark 
status in 2001. This doesnt actually protect 
the building from demolition, but it 
recognizes that the buildings Northern 
Italian architectural style has been 
preserved.
Casey would describe his 
restaurant as having a "family 
atmosphere. He said, "Youll 
see four generations of 
people eating here. Theres 
a little of something for 
everybody. Even though 
we make beer, people 
bring their families 
here.
The Open Door 
Church, previously the 
Union Baptist Church, 
is now a community 
center.
The Church Brew 
Works embraces 
its religious 
setting.

From their website: "By far, the most breathtaking element 
is the position of the brew house on the altar... the steel 
and copper tanks gleaming in the celestial blue backdrop is 
nothing less than captivating. It also stores merchandise in 
one of the former confessionals.
It is the (perhaps ironic) position of the brew house on the 
altar that concerns some. I would rather see a building used 
for apartments or a restaurant than be torn down, but the 
beer tap on the altar makes me uncomfortable, Burke said 
about The Church Brew Works, a place he has dined at before. 
Indeed, several other churches in Pittsburgh have been sold 
and are now used as reception halls, law offices, and even a 
home for the elderly.
Another church, the Union Baptist Church in East Liberty, 
had shut down and fallen into disrepair. In 2001, a group of 
volunteers stepped in to repair the church. They purchased 
the church for $125,000, according to the Post-Gazette.
By August 2005 the Union Project had hosted over 1300 
volunteers for over 13,000 hours of work, stated the Union 
Projects website. Fundraising toward the $1.5 million was 90 
percent complete. The project also received many corporate 
donations and grants from The Sprout Fund, the H.J. Heinz 
Co. Foundation, and the Allegheny Foundation. According to 
the Post-Gazette, the Union Project also received a $700,000 
federal grant.

The church, which reopened recently, has been renamed 
the Open Door Church." It is no longer Baptist, but nondenominational. The building is no longer exclusively a church 
either; rather, it is a community center. The building houses 
offices for non-profit organizations and serves a variety of other 
purposes; there is also gallery space. The center offers classes 
in ceramics and stained glass.
Some events coming up include 
a showing of the film Crash, 
followed by a discussion on 
racial tension, on February 6, and 
an evening of music and food 
with members of the Pittsburgh 
Somali -Bantu community on 
February 20. The Union Project is 
online at www.unionproject.org.
Churches have, traditionally, 
always been used as centers for 
the community. Many churches 
offer counseling services and 
sanctuary for the homeless from 
bitter winter weather. Also, many churches are regularly used 
for concerts. Last week, the Carnegie Mellon Chamber Orchestra 
performed in a church. Many classical music recordings 
have been made in churches because of the great acoustics.
Ryan England, a senior civil and environmental engineering 
major, was one of many CMU students that volunteered on 
the Union Project. "Church buildings are often the least used 
property," he said. They use them on Sundays for services, but 
theyre empty on the other six days of the week." Hence, the 
multiple uses of the church building makes perfect sense.
Many have praised the group of volunteers that built the 
Union Project. State Senator Jim Ferlo is quoted on the Union 
Projects website. He said, "This organization has taken on
the task of restoring a once vacant building into a remarkable 
functioning community center.... The Union Project has been 
very creative and relentless in their fundraising."
England was very satisfied by the experience of volunteering 
to work on the Union Project. "I think it was really fun and
exciting to be a part of something that 
could really improve the community. 
East Liberty has had its ups and 
downs, but its seen a lot of positive 
growth," he said. The Union Project is 
an expression of hope.
The Union Projects most successful 
event so far was its Martin Luther 
King Day celebration. The people who 
were running it were like Wow, where 
did everybody come from? Everybody 
was really happy to be there," England 
said. The congregation of people 
packing the church had braved the 
evening and winter elements to come 
out for the MLK celebration.
What do The Church Brew Works and the Union Project have 
in common? They both preserved wonderful church buildings 
that have been part of the city of Pittsburgh for decades. Like 
one of the main perceived benefits of organized religion  a 
community environment where people can rely on one another 
and enjoy their common sets of beliefs  both the restaurant 
and the community center bring people together. One brings 
families together through good food, the other brings people 
together through the arts and Christianity. And both help to 
preserve some unique Pittsburgh architecture.
By far, the most 
breathtaking element is 
the position of the brew 
house on the altar...

The sleep schedule of the alpha student
Polyphasic sleeping might be the solution for busy CMU students
Sleep. An increasingly rare commodity among university 
students nationwide, it's that which is craved yet seldom fully 
enjoyed. It's that feeling of blissful nothingness, a time during 
which papers and exams cannot dominate your life. What if, 
instead of being reserved as a seemingly short-lived prize at 
the end of a painfully long school day, sleep was integrated 
into our lives on an hour-by-hour basis?
Perhaps it can be so. Behold: the Uberman sleep schedule, 
also referred to as polyphasic sleeping. This is the new frontier 
in the world of getting proper rest for those overworked souls 
populating our restless, fast-paced society. First there was the 
eight-hour period called nighttime, then came the five-hour 
nighttime supplemented by the midday nap, and now there is 
this myth-tumed-reality: Its napping  all day long.
But how does it work?
Ask Leonardo da Vinci. Or maybe Albert Einstein. Perhaps 
even the cast of Seinfeld. Or, for the purposes of accessibility
 and, well, reality  turn to a handful of brothers of 
Carnegie Mellons Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity 
chapter. It is these five brothers that came up with the idea 
to, upon returning to CMU two weeks ago for the spring 
semester, begin implementing a plan of alternating brief 
sleeping cycles with normal daily activity. According to the ' 
guys themselves, these "elitist members maximize their life 
fulfillment and productivity by sleeping only three hours per 
day  for mere 20- to 30-minute durations every four hours. 
From midnight to 12:30 am, 4 to 4:30 am, 8 to 8:30 am, noon 
to 12:30 pm, 4 to 4:30 pm, and 8 to 8:30 pm, they should be
asleep. For the rest of the day, then, the goal is to be awake  
and not just to be awake, but to be alert and fully functional, 
as much as Carnegie Mellon students can be.
So how are they faring? Brother Helder Rocha, the only 
remaining member employing the sleep experiment to its 
fullest extent, commented that polyphasic sleep is not that 
bad. Having started immediately upon beginning his spring 
classes, Rocha seems perfectly rested and vigilant, as if he 
just awoke from a solid eight-hour sleep. The first week is 
really key, he added, implying that once you get into the 
rhythm of sleeping on such a stringent, choppy cycle, it 
becomes second nature. But is it healthy? Will it last?
According to Dana Sullivan's recent article titled How to 
Nap in Real Simple magazine, napping in general provides 
many of the restorative benefits that a full night's sleep does, 
including ... feeling refreshed and alert. The website of the 
University of Pittsburgh Medical Centers Sleep Medicine 
Center supports the statement, saying that the ideal nap is 
"anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. It should be long enough 
to benefit from sleep, but not so long as to send you into deep 
sleep."
Perhaps, then, napping is fine, but what about the SAE 
brothers' plan to rely on only napping? So far, the long-term 
effects of polyphasic sleeping are unknown. What is known, 
though, is that once one is disciplined enough to commit to 
the strange cycle, falling immediately into deep REM (rapid 
eye movement) sleep becomes automatic. Steve Pavlina, a 
chronic personal-development blogger from Nevada, has kept
perhaps the most detailed log of his own polyphasic sleep 
experiment and has said that this experiment did in fact 
succeed in a big way and [led me to decide] to adopt this 
method of sleep indefinitely.
So polyphasic sleeping deters lethargy, and perhaps insomnia. 
You can sleep for fewer hours a day, and feel just as wellrested and satisfied. Rocha calls it "intriguing," and Sullivan 
calls napping necessary and relaxing. Whether the half: 
hour-every-four-hours schedule will work for you is yet to 
be determined. In the meantime, consider daily naps as an 
alternative.
Check back next week foi more on napping in college and 
improving your napping skills. (Hint: Practice makes perfect.)

Gallery Crawl: Can you keep up?
Multiple galleries in Downtown showcase artists latest works
Let there be art! On Friday, Pittsburgh proved its art scene 
had a pulse. The thriving artist community of Pittsburgh 
staged a series of 12 unique gallery events in a grand tour 
de force, drawing hundreds to look in awe at their brilliant 
creative endeavors.
The "Gallery Crawl, presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural 
Trust, worked on a simple premise: People will come to 
see free art. The premise worked so well that sometimes it 
seemed like the galleries couldn't hold the throngs of people.
No longer can one claim a stagnant world of art in the City of 
Three Rivers.
Putting up one particularly interesting collection of films, 
the SPACE gallery played short films by artist T. Foley and 
students in a collection called License. So many people filled 
this gallery that I could barely hear, but one visual image I 
could catch and ponder involved a blow-up doll driving a car. 
Maybe "License" referred to giving dolls licenses.
The fun film "Colon Dash Forward Slash" had a string of 
^ emoticons in rapid succession, and when someone stepped 
on a mat in front of the screen, it would freeze on one 
emoticon and a computerized voice would throw out a phrase. 
One emoticon  !-(  emitted a surprised "Ouch!"
At Future Tenant, Bryan Lauch had an exhibition of different 
kinds of sculptures. Lauch, an adjunct professor of art at 
Pitt, used various odds and ends to create works of "mobile 
sculpture," which had all been "performed in public spaces. 
"Centrifugal Orbis" used a central metal axis around which 
hanging pots full of paints could rotate and drip colors in a 
circular pattern.
Another sculpture, Lauchs "Naturalization Vehicle," involved 
the most intriguing musical combination of media I have 
ever seen. The list of materials consists of piano, bicycle, 
bamboo, glass, paints, and steel. One person can pedal the 
stationary bike and move the bamboo hanging off the handle 
bars while another person can sit at the piano and hit the 
exposed strings with sticks. I asked Lauch how he came up 
with these ideas, and he said he had no defined process. He 
instead relied on a stream of consciousness sort of mindset 
when trying to assemble pieces others would see as junk. He 
attributed the way of thinking with connecting his mind and 
hands so he could produce these works.
The folks from Unicom Mountain, a local arts anthology, have 
brought together Pittsburgh artists for about a year now, and 
their exhibition at the Three Rivers Art Gallery included some 
very special pieces that embraced more than painting. Artists 
like Jodee Ferrari, Pat Lewis, and Ed Piskar had some rockin 
comics up for sale.
Unicom Mountain puts together all kinds of works, such 
as comics, writing, sketches, and music, that come from 
local Pittsburgh artists. Curt Gettman, the publisher and 
editor of the collection, said that the group invites many 
artists to contribute, but he also pointed out, "I love to see 
envelopes come in from a new name with some awesome 
painting. Thats a good feeling." The open-ended compilation 
represents a quality sampling of our local area, and Gettman 
wants Unicom Mountain to act as a gathering point for 
Pittsburgh artists who lead successful individual careers.
The ArtUpstairs gallery has served the Pittsburgh community 
for a little over a year, and curator Erin ONeill arranged a 
multifaceted gallery for display that analyzed the dynamics
of couples, called "Equipoise: Couples Exhibition." O'Neill 
asked 11 couples to produce a work of art together at the 
time when summer begins to succumb to fall and they begin 
preparations for the winter. Only one member of the couple 
needed to be an artist, and the collection of works tried to 
answer the question "What keeps human couples together 
anyway?
"Equipoise" gave a little more to think about than the simple 
"Wow! That's cool! artwork. One installation involved 
pictures of gardening accompanied by a hung and coiled 
hose that created a green aura, evoking images of the passing 
summer. The couple Stacy and "Soy Sauce collaborated 
to create a dance performance that drew in many young 
onlookers. O'Neill wanted to collect high-caliber art that 
would encourage the couples to work in partnership and 
enhance their relationships. "Many of the couples came closer 
than they anticipated," ONeill said. They found out more 
about each other than they thought they would."
This evening of Pittsburgh art made me ask myself to define 
a particular glue" that held these people to the city, to define 
a certain personality. I could not successfully find it, but I 
believe that such groups as the year-old Unicorn Mountain 
and ArtUpstairs will play an integral part in establishing 
Pittsburghs place in the arts world. With artist-educators 
Bryan Lauch and David Deily, who put on a display of 
ceramics; strong schools like the Pennsylvania Culinary 
Institute; and bold, experienced curators like Erin ONeill, new 
generations of creative souls will define Pittsburgh's artistic 
character.

This week, you will slip into a psychedelically directionless parallel 
dimension wherein all your conceptions of physical reality and 
coordinating colors will be challenged. You will narrowly escape after 
realizing that youve only taken a wrong turn and wound up on the 
Kraus Campo.
The sum of all Tom Clancys fears will be realized when a nuclear device 
is detonated at the Super Bowl. Luckily, most of the Steelers will survive 
unscathed by seeking shelter behind Jerome Bettis.
Three black eyes, a knot of forearms, and a hefty dose of humiliation 
later, you'll decide that three-way high fives are just not worth it.
Your redesigned computer keyboard is groundbreaking and ingenious. 
You will ease wrist and finger strain while boosting productivity. Too bad 
Qwerty isnt going quietly. Too bad it knows where you live.
Your new punk rock band, Allegedly Odious, is the hottest thing to hit 
the music scene in years. Unfortunately, your first tour will be unable to 
get off the ground, since accepting sponsorship from Axe Body Spray 
runs contrary to your groups mission statement.
Your room draw number this year will be 666. Good luck finding 
someone to be your roommate in Hell.
You will read Arthur Goldens long awaited follow-up novel Memoirs of a 
Gigolo. Though critically panned, the movie version will be a smashing 
success at next years TBA.
Heres the thing  its not that youre a bad dancer, and you know 
everyone loves the Electric Slide. But there are certain times (namely 
physics lectures and funerals) where its just inappropriate. Try the 
Macarena next time.
You will realize, much to your horror, that even though there are two 
individual bars in every Twix wrapper, each is significantly thinner than 
a standard candy bar, so youre really not getting any more for your 
money. You will have to be physically restrained and forcibly removed 
from the Grab-N-Go.
The judge will throw out your lawsuit. It may have been cruel and 
insensitive of the librarians to break up your fort of books, but contrary 
to your adamant claims, the floor was not hot lava.
The new Gates Center for Computer Science, made possible by an 
extremely generous $20 million donation from Bill Gates, will be a 
whopping 208,000 square feet. Upon its opening in 2009, though, 
you'll find that about half that space is occupied by a Steve Jobs 
Whack-a-Mole game and the world's largest Supercuts.
Your girlfriend appreciates your efforts to write her love poetry; she 
just wishes youd try coming up with something all by yourself instead 
of simply reciting Meat Loaf lyrics. Also, your exaggerated facial 
expressions dont say seduction!" so much as kidney stone!

From left to right, Laura Mixon, Matt Gardiner, Kara Lindsay, Antwayn Hopper, and Steffi Garrard 
perform in "Fitting In." Students from all CFA majors collaborated in the Dance-Light show this 
weekend, creating a set of three dances performed over two nights. The last performance helped 
raise money for the seniors' yearly trip to Los Angeles, where they apply for potential jobs.
