CMU remedies 
blood shortage 
in Pittsburgh
by Cecilia Westbrook
Junior Staffwriter
Students who are too busy 
to donate their time, food, or 
skills to help other Pittsburgh 
residents in need have another 
option  donating blood.
Last Tuesday, the Doctors of 
Carnegie (DOCs) organized 
a blood drive in which repre
sentatives from Central Blood 
Bank took blood from about 28 
students, staff, and faculty in 
Rangos 3 in the University Cen
ter from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
DOCs is a student organiza
tion devoted to increasing health 
awareness on campus and serv
ing the campus community in 
health-related ways, according 
to the groups website.
The blood drive was the sec
ond that the blood bank has 
held at Carnegie Mellon in the 
past two weeks. On February 19, 
the organization held an emer
gency drive for which students 
who donated were compensated 
with $5 in cash or entry in a lot
tery to win as much as $300.
A critical blood shortage has 
fueled the recent increase in 
drives by Central Blood Bank. 
Although the shortage has mer
ited emergency action on the 
part of blood banks, such con
ditions are not unusual at this 
time of year.
We typically see a decrease 
in [blood] giving during the 
winter, said Brooke Kubiak, 
business development repre
sentative for Central Blood

Protesters form a human chain to block an entrance to the National Robotics and Engineering Institute, a Carnegie Mellon facility that develops military technology for the U.S. government.
by Annika Rosenvinge
Junior Staffwriter
Last Friday, approximately 
50 anti-war protesters gathered 
in front of Carnegie Mellons 
National Robotics Engineering 
Center (NREC) in Lawrenceville at 5 a.m. to protest 
the development of federal 
goverment-commissioned mili
tary technology.
The protest was organized 
primarily by the Pittsburgh 
Organizing Group (POG). The
organization describes itself as 
a radical group based in Pitts
burgh working to affect systemic 
progressive change in society, 
according to its website. Protest
ers stationed themselves outside 
the buildings two entrances, 
chanting Unplug the war ma
chine! and Shut down the killer 
robots!
Fourteen protesters chained 
themselves together using lock
boxes, or what Carnegie Mellon 
police sergeant William Richie 
termed the sleeping dragon 
technique  long pipes of steel
and mesh covered in duct tape 
through which peoples hands 
are locked togetherand sat in a 
line in front of the buildings main 
entrance on 43rd Street, while 
six others chained themselves 
to the 40th Street entrance. One 
protester suspended herself from 
a tripod 15 feet in the air in front 
of a main vehicle entrance.
Both city and University Po
lice were stationed around the 
periphery of the building in cars 
and on bikes.
We were there to ensure ev
eryones safety and to look out
for our property and facility, 
said Richie. Our concern was 
the Carnegie Mellon property, 
not the city streets. We didnt 
have to take any action through
out the protest.
Pittsburgh city police ar
rested the 14 protesters who 
were obstructing the 43rd Street 
entrance, but allowed the six at 
the 40th Street entrance to re
main.
As of March 3, those arrested 
were arraigned, released, and 
are awaiting trial on March 8, ac
cording to the POGs website.
[The purpose of the protest 
was] to throw a direct wrench 
in the war machine by physically 
halting work on military technol
ogies at the NREC for the day, 
said David Meieran, a member of 
the POG and one of the leading 
organizers of the protest.
Meieran, a former Ph.D. can
didate in Carnegie Mellons 
philosophy department, left the 
university shortly before the Iraq 
war to dedicate himself to activ
ism against U.S. involvement in

Illegal downloading by college 
students has once again .moved 
into the spotlight at colleges and 
universities nationwide. Last 
Wednesday, the Recording In
dustry Association of America 
(RIAA) began apprehending 
college students for illegal music 
downloading at a rate more than 
three times higher than the pre
vious academic year.
The increase is part of the 
groups new strengthened 
anti-piracy campus initiative pro
gram.
We recognize that the nature 
of online music theft is changing, 
and we need to adjust our strat
egies accordingly, said Mitch 
Bainwol, chairman and CEO of 
the RIAA, in a February 28 press 
release.
RIAA members are responsible 
for creating, manufacturing, and 
distributing over 90 percent of 
all music in the United States. 
The associations job is to protect 
the intellectual property rights 
of its members. The RIAAs first 
step in a series of stringent new 
initiatives is to identify college 
students and faculty members 
who are violating these rights by 
illegally downloading music.
Over 400 students and person
nel at 13 colleges and universities 
across the nation received pre
litigation settlement letters from 
the RIAA.
Ohio University topped the list 
with 50 such letters. North Caro
lina State University, Syracuse
University, and the University 
of Massachusetts Amherst were 
next on the list with 37 apiece. 
Other top contenders include the 
University of Nebraska - Lincoln, 
the University of Texas at Austin,
and the University of South Flor
ida, with 36, 33, and 31 letters, 
respectively.
Ohio University and the Uni
versity of Nebraska - Lincoln are

Carnegie Mellon 
holds Model UN 
conference
Last weekend, Carnegie Mellons 
International Relations Organization 
(IRO) held its third annual Model 
United Nations conference for high 
school students. This years theme was 
Revolution, Reaction, and Reform.
The goals of the conference were 
fostering diplomatic exchange on cur
rent global affairs, challenging students 
beyond their regular academic curricu
lum, and encouraging them to take an 
active role in international politics by 
adopting such roles as delegates, jus
tices, journalists, and national leaders. 
As a result, students gain an interna
tional perspective on current events, 
according to the IROs website.
The IRO was founded to promote 
awareness of the global community 
and an understanding of international 
business.
Islam awarded by 
National Science 
Foundation
Mohammad F. Islam, an assistant 
professor of chemical engineering and 
materials science and engineering, 
has received the Faculty Early Career 
Development Award from the National 
Science Foundation (NSF), according to 
a February 28 university press release.
Islam will receive $500,000 over a 
five-year period to research the arrange
ment of atoms and molecules in certain 
crystals and alloys. Understanding the 
structure in which the particles are 
assembled will affect how certain mate
rials are designed, including those used 
for drug delivery, biochemical sensors, 
and in the biomedical and defense in
dustry sectors.
Islam hopes that the research will 
lead to the discovery of new ways to 
teach these complicated concepts to un
dergraduate and high school students, 
according to the press release.
Islams work at Carnegie Mellon has 
focused on investigating the structure 
and dynamics of synthetic and biologi
cal soft matter in order to understand 
the relationship between microscopic 
structure and macroscopic properties, 
among other traditional concepts, ac
cording to the Islam Groups website.
Islam, who joined the Carnegie Mellon 
faculty in 2005, also received a 2007 
Alfred P. Sloan research fellowship.
First-years and 
seniors asked to take 
NSSE
This spring, Carnegie Mellon 
first-years and seniors are being asked 
to take the National Survey of Student 
Engagement, according to the uni
versitys department of Institutional 
Research and Analysis.
The survey will assess the correlation 
between students good educational 
practices and how much they benefit 
from their college experience.
Students will report the frequency 
with which they engage in dozens of 
activities that represent good educa
tional practices, assess their academic 
performance and personal growth, and 
record their perceptions of the college 
environment.
The survey was developed by 
the Pew Charitable Trusts and the 
National Center for Higher Education 
Management Systems. Indira Nair, the 
universitys vice provost for education, 
is sponsoring the administration of the 
survey at Carnegie Mellon.
The test was first administered in 
1999 to students at 68 colleges and 
universities. This spring, 1.1 million 
undergraduate students at 609 institu
tions throughout the United States and 
Canada are expected to take the survey, 
according to a March 1 article in FOCUS, 
the universitys faculty newsletter.

Gender-neutral housing pilot passes
by Brian Burdulia
Junior Staffwriter
Borrowing a shirt or a pair of 
jeans from your roommate may 
soon become a less innocuous 
proposition. Last week, Carnegie 
Mellon approved student body 
President Karl Sjogren and VicePresident Andrea Hamiltons 
proposed gender-neutral hous
ing pilot study. The study will re
serve Shady Oak Apartments for 
. students who wish to live with a 
roommate of the opposite sex.
The option will be available for 
current students participating in 
Room Draw this semster. During 
Room Draw, students interested 
in participating in the pilot study
will be given the opportunity to 
select male, female, or no 
preference, when requesting 
their roommate for next semes
ter. Students can also request to 
be pulled in to an apartment 
by a member of the opposite sex 
or decide to room with a specific 
person of the opposite sex prior to 
selecting a living space, accord
ing to www.karlandrea.com.
The study allows students who 
want to live with someone of 
the opposite sex to do so while 
staying in the campus housing 
system, rather than being forced 
to move off campus. Each Shady 
Oak apartment contains one 
or two bedrooms and a private 
bathroom. While the apartments 
will be initially reserved for stu
dents in the pilot study, those 
apartments that are not filled 
by students participating in the 
study will be made available to 
students who want traditional 
housing arrangements.
Incoming first-year students 
cannot request to participate in 
the study. If a first-year student 
is placed in gender-neutral hous
ing, his or her family must be 
informed before the student is 
allowed to move in, according to 
the terms of the proposal.
The university has been con
sidering the idea for a number of 
years but decided to implement 
the study only after Sjogren and 
Hamilton presented their formal 
proposal for such a system.
The purpose of the pilot study
is to explore whether or not 
Carnegie Mellon is capable of 
sustaining mixed-gender liv
ing in campus housing, other 
than the limited co-ed arrange
ments currently available in 
special-interest housing.
The proposed study has
been met with varied levels 
of support on campus. In in
terviews conducted by the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, students 
responses ranged from doubts 
about residents maturity to 
claims that co-ed living is good 
preparation for life after college.
Carnegie Mellon will join ap
proximately 30 other colleges 
and universities nationwide that 
currently offer mixed-gender 
housing options.
Creating a global university: CMU around the world
by Mona Maher
Junior Staffwriter
Over the past three weeks, 
Carnegie Mellon has made head
lines thousands of miles away 
from Pittsburgh. On February 
12, Carnegie Mellons West Coast 
campus announced the launch 
of its new masters program in 
software management. And last 
week, Carnegie Mellons Austra
lia campus received $1.35 million 
to fund 15 scholarships for stu
dents in the masters program in 
information technology.
In addition to these campuses 
in Silicon Valley, Calif., and Ad
elaide, Australia, the university 
has branches in Doha, Qatar; Ath
ens, Greece; and Kobe, Japan.
Basically, this is a realiza
tion that the world has become 
an incredibly connected global 
economy, said Carnegie Mellon 
President Jared Cohon. And to 
be successful in that economy, 
our alumni have to be prepared to 
deal effectively in that very con
nected kind of world. That means 
understanding, first of all, that it 
is a connected global world, and 
second of all, knowing how to 
work across cultures.
Carnegie Mellons Qatar cam
pus offers undergraduate degrees 
in business administration and
computer science. The Qatar 
campus is home to less than 200 
students, and its inaugural class 
will graduate in May 2008.
The case in Qatar is both 
unusual and unique, said Lisa 
Kreig, director of the Office of 
International Education. It has 
presented the opportunity to 
open up our perspective of Gulf 
culture... in a way that we simply 
didnt have before.
Cohon emphasized the impor
tance of cultural and intellectual 
exchange between campuses.
[The global university] means 
... going to these other places and 
having a physical presence in 
them, Cohon said. Qatar stands 
out because it is the only place we 
offer undergraduate programs 
outside of Pittsburgh. It is the 
only place where we have a pres
ence in the Middle East.
However, studies show that 
the university has made prog
ress in globalizing the Pittsburgh 
campus  over the past decade, 
the international student popula
tion on Carnegie Mellons main 
campus has grown by about 146 
percent, according to the Office 
of International Education.
With the exception of Qatar, 
the branch campuses offer only 
masters programs. Established 
in 2002, Carnegie Mellon West 
(CMW) originally offered only
Artist depiction of new facilities on the Qatar campus that are slated to 
open this year. The building will house classrooms and computer labs.
a masters program in software 
engineering in which students 
could choose to pursue a techni
cal track and/or a development 
management track.
The masters program in soft
ware management , which will 
begin next fall, was created to 
prepare students to address the 
business side of software within 
the context of the global market, 
according to a February 13 press 
release from Carnegie Mellon 
West. -
Also in 2002, Carnegie Mellon
opened its Athens branch. The 
campus offers a masters pro
gram in sciepce in information 
networking (MSIN), the result of 
a joint effort between Carnegie 
Mellons Information Network
ing Institute in Pittsburgh and 
Athens Information Technology, 
an education and research center 
in Athens.

Blood drives on campus
DRIVE, from Al
Bank. Donors are less willing 
to leave their homes when its 
cold outside, or too busy to think 
of donating during the holiday 
season, which contributes to the 
decreased rate of donations, Kubiak explained.
In addition, more dona
tions are needed during winter 
months because of the increased 
frequency of car accidents, 
which means an increase in the 
number of victims who may re
quire emergency transfusions.
Central Blood Bank runs at 
least one drive per month on 
campus, and even more when 
there are blood shortages. The 
Red Cross also runs drives on 
campus regularly; however, 
unlike Central Blood Bank, a 
non-profit organization that col
lects for the city of Pittsburgh, 
the Red Cross ships the blood it 
collects to hospitals outside of 
Pittsburgh.
Blood drives come to the Carn
egie Mellon campus so often 
because a substantial portion of 
the Carnegie Mellon community 
has consistently donated blood 
each month, Kubiak said.
I love coming to CMU, Ku
biak said. Everybody here is so 
helpful.
Many of the drives here are 
organized by groups on campus 
whose members invite the blood 
banks, organize public relations, 
book the rooms, and even give 
blood themselves.
Last Tuesdays drive was or
ganized by Danielle Eytan, a 
sophomore biology major and 
vice-president of volunteering 
for DOCs. The group holds one 
blood drive every year.
I sent out a lot of e-mails, 
put up flyers, made a Facebook 
event, and went around per
sonally asking people I know to 
give, Eytan said.
While she did not know much 
about blood drives when she 
joined DOCs, Eytan said she has 
learned a lot through her inter
action with Central Blood Bank. 
At last Tuesdays drive, she even 
gave blood for the first time.
Theres just such a need right 
now, Eytan said.
In addition to the work of or
ganizations, it is the goodwill of 
members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, particularly stu
dents who choose to give blood, 
that keeps the blood bank com
ing back.
Although the drives welcome 
walk-ins and first-time givers, 
many of the donors present al
ready give on a regular basis.
I only gave once last se
mester, said computer science 
graduate student Brian Hirshman. Definitely not as often as 
I should.
Junior information systems 
major Paul OShannessy has 
given blood at least four times 
over the past three years.
Other people need it, and Im 
doing just fine, OShannessy 
said. Everybody should give 
blood.
However, Central Blood Bank 
is constantly seeking new do
nors. The organization is the sole 
provider for all the hospitals in 
the Pittsburgh region, of which 
there are oyer 40.
Even without a shortage, the 
bank requires donations from at 
least 725 people per day to meet 
the need for blood.
For many students, fear is the 
major obstacle to donating for 
the first time. Even Eytan, who 
organized the event, expressed 
concerns.
Yeah, Im nervous, Eytan 
said. I hate needles.
More experienced donors 
were able to brush off the fear.
Yeah, the needle still freaks 
me out, but you just feel it a little 
bit, OShannessy said, grabbing 
a cookie and a few minutes rest 
after donating. The first time I 
donated, I felt a little weak and 
I had to lay down after a while, 
but that was it.
Despite the fears of many 
first-time donors, giving 
blood is usually a painless and 
risk-free endeavor. To avoid be
coming lightheaded after do
nating, make sure to eat one or 
two hours before giving blood 
and stay hydrated, said Kristina 
Crapp, a nurse for Central Blood 
Bank.
Usually people feel fine after
15 minutes, and blood regenera

THE TARTAN  MARCH 5, 2007
Global university makes headlinesAnti-war group protests at NREC
GLOBAL, from A3forts of the College of Fine Arts 
and the School of Computer Sci
ence, students on the Adelaide 
campus have access to a brand 
new, state-of-the-art Entertain
ment Technology Center (ETC), 
modeled after the original cen
ter on the Pittsburgh campus. 
The ETCs goal is to combine 
creativity and technology to 
produce innovative projects in 
entertainment.
The scholarship money was 
donated to the campus by Tels
tra, an Australian telecommuni
cations and information services 
company. The companys CEO, 
Sol Trujillo, made the contribu
tion because he was impressed by 
the regions commitment to tech
nological innovation and success 
in bringing Carnegie Mellon to 
Australia, according to a Febru
ary 27 article by Australian news 
service AdelaideNow.
One of our goals is to have 
students sign up and enroll in 
Adelaide and in Pittsburgh, blit 
what wed love to do is have the 
first semester for everybody be 
in one location, and alternate 
that location from year to year, 
Cohon said. This creates logis
tical issues and cost issues, but 
wed love to do more of that.
Zein agreed that the univer
sity needed to increase relations 
of students between campuses.
The only connection we have 
[with the other campuses] is with 
the professors, and no relation 
with students, Zein said. Maybe 
CMU can integrate group work 
into some courses, and to have 
the groups composed of students 
from the different campuses.
While the university has in
vested extensive efforts to get 
students to understand the 
meaning of global economy, Jen
nifer Church, dean of Student 
Affairs, also believes that the 
integration of students from dif
ferent cultures still needs some 
work.
Students tend to gravitate 
toward things they have in com
mon, such as background, but 
also in terms of academics and
student activities, she said.
According to a 2004 under
graduate survey by University 
Planning and the Eberly Center 
for Teaching Excellence, only 
30 percent of the 2693 students 
surveyed voted that Carnegie 
Mellon promoted interactions 
with diverse others a great 
deal. Ten percent voted none. 
As a result of this very strong 
international student body, we 
have very strong student or
ganizations revolving around 
nationalities. Those are good 
things too because they provide 
an organization on campus that 
focuses on each countrys cul
ture and language, Cohon said. 
On the other hand, it also binds 
those students together to the ef
fect that sometimes it separates 
them from the rest of the cam
pus, and thats a bad thing.
The Pittsburgh campus has 
created several initiatives to in
crease the interactions between 
diverse students. The Multicul
tural Presidents Council (MPC), 
comprised of the presidents of 
the universitys ethnic student 
organizations, is one example.
Sunaina Menawat, a senior in 
psychology and public policy and 
management, is a multicultural 
intern who helps run the MPC.
Our meetings are once a 
week and we focus on issues of 
collaboration and organizational 
support and advising, she said.
Cohon reminded the campus 
community that creating a global 
university takes time.
Since Carnegie Mellon is one 
of the first schools to develop 
a global university system, he 
explained, there is no existing 
model to consult when the uni
versity runs into problems.
We have to remember that 
were really at the outset of this 
globalization effort by the uni
versity. So were still discovering 
things, and trying out things as 
we go along, Cohon said.
exception of two students from 
Turkey. Now, the program has 
graduated 48 students from 12 
different countries, including 
Greece, India, Iran, Lebanon, 
and Pakistan.
Out of the 18 students of the 
original class who graduated in 
2006, six chose to spend the sec
ond year of their program at the 
Pittsburgh campus.
The diversity enriched my 
knowledge about cultures, said 
Ali Zein, a first-year Lebanese 
student in the MSIN program.
Zein said that his academic and 
cultural experiences in Athens 
have been fascinating for him. 
Zein holds a bachelors degree in 
computer science from the Amer
ican University of Beirut.
Ghassan Karami, a student at 
the Athens campus who is also 
from Lebanon, shares an equally 
positive attitude.
Athens is a great place to live 
... perfect weather, perfect night 
life, nice people, and the culture 
here is so close to our own [Arab] 
culture, so it is like living in Bei
rut, Karami said.
The Information Networking 
Institute (INI) also contributed 
to programs at the Kobe, Ja
pan campus. In 2005, the insti
tute teamed up with the Heinz 
School to develop the masters 
in information technology  
information security program 
(MSIN-IS). The INI worked with 
the Hyogo Institute of Informa
tion Education Foundation in 
Japan to create the Carnegie Mel
lon CyLab Japan, an outgrowth 
of the Pittsburgh CyLab.
The CyLab develops new 
technologies for sustainable 
computing and communications 
systems and determines how the 
global economy will impact the 
development of such technology.
Last May, the Adelaide campus 
opened with masters programs 
in public policy and manage
ment, information technology, 
and entertainment technology.

At least this way it provides an 
amazing opportunity for research 
and jobs, said the student, who 
wished to remain anonymous.
Meieran argued that the same 
logic could be applied to past war 
crimes like Nazism.

The POG stated that it had

goal, which was to interject an 
anti-war message at a war-related 
facility that has thus far received 
no public scrutiny and to block 
the NREC facility for the full 
working day, according to the 
groups website.
Mary Ruth Auoo, a retired 
nurse who works often with the 
Thomas Merton Center, a Pitts
burgh-based activist group also 
involved in the protest, agreed.

of these projects are designed for

Jay Sadeghi, who graduated 
from Carnegie Mellon in 2005 
with a bachelors degree in art 
and linguistics and was present at 
the protest, questioned whether 
the NRECs role in designing 
military technology made the 
center indirectly responsible for 
perpetuating the war in Iraq.
As a CMU undergrad, I knew 
less about the military technology 
that were involved in produc
ing, Sadeghi said. I think its 
our duty as current members or 
alums of CMU to at least consider 
what role we are playing in the 
production of war by supporting 
the NREC.
However, a Carnegie Mellon 
student in computer science and 
robotics disagreed.
If CMU shut down their pro
duction, the Pentagon would just 
go elsewhere. And if all of the 
universities in America refused 
to participate, the government 
would just do it themselves.

Lego contest helps fund Habitat trip
HABITAT, from Alsophomore math and civil and 
environmental engineering ma
jor who organized the event. 
Legos just seemed like an easy 
way for people not used to build
ing real houses to get involved.
Carnegie Mellons chapter is 
not the only habitat group thats 
been active in the area. Last 
Wednesday, Pittsburghs Habitat 
for Humanity chapter dedicated 
a house in Duquesne. The house 
will be occupied by a single 
mother and her toddler son, ac
cording to a February 27 press 
release from Pittsburgh Habitat 
for Humanity.
While the Carnegie Mellon 
chapter didnt help build this 
house, student representatives 
recently met with members of the 
Pittsburgh chapter to discuss get
ting involved in the construction 
of two more homes in Duquesne 
that will begin next month, said 
Maggie Withrow, the executive 
director of Pittsburgh Habitat for 
Humanity.
In addition, Withrow met with 
Carnegie Mellons Habitat chap
ter president, junior business 
major Yvonne Dang Kiat, and the
clubs advisor, Shernell Smith, to 
discuss ways in which Carnegie 
Mellon could get involved with 
the Pittsburgh chapter other than 
construction. Two ideas were in
viting architecture students to 
serve on the chapters construc
tion committee, and having 
technology students provide 
design and tech support in the 
chapters office, Withrow said.
According to Yue, the Carnegie 
Mellon chapter has not yet partic
ipated in a build with Pittsburghs 
chapter; however, the university 
chapter attends about six Satur
day workdays per semester with 
the Beaver County chapter.
Yue emphasized that partici
pating in Habitat projects is a 
rewarding experience that opens 
ones eyes to the plight of others 
right in their own neighbor
hood. She feels that the spring 
break trip is a chance to do 
something meaningful during a 
break traditionally reserved for 
self-indulgence.
She also added that news of 
the chapter is catching on.
Its word of mouth, she said. 
It just spreads.

rebuilding effort over last years 
spring break.
When I went on the trip last 
year, I had an amazing expe
rience, she said. I felt good 
knowing that I could build a 
house.
The members of this years trip 
will be constructing and raising 
the frame of the house, which 
will accomplish about a third of 
the building process, Yue said.
This year is special because 
a lot of people are going who 
havent gone before, she said. 
There are also a lot of interna
tional students who can bring 
the experience back to their own 
countries.
Last Saturday, the group 
teamed up with Carnegie Mellons 
Lego Club to host a Lego-building 
contest in order to raise money 
for the trip.
Habitat for Humanity thought 
it would be a nice idea to have a 
building competition, since what 
we are doing is raising money 
to build, said Nadia Bosan, a
Students caught downloading illegally
was denied access to the network 
for 45 days. In the meantime, she 
was forced to set up a new wired 
network or rely on her friends 
computers.
However, the way in which stu
dents are reprimanded for such 
offenses varies between schools.
Administrators at the Univer
sity of Michigan, for example, 
claimed that they rarely notified 
students who are flagged by the 
RIAA because its too difficult 
to track down every offender, 
according to the Post-Gazette 
article. The university reported 
that, none of the students become 
a repeat offender.
The RIAA is working toward 
preventing future punishment 
of college students by increasing 
awareness among young adults. 
The organization supports pro
grams like i-SAFE, Close Up, 
and Young Minds Inspired that 
inform students of the risks asso
ciated with illegal downloading.
These new efforts aim to 
help students recognize that the 
consequences for illegal down
loading are more real than ever 
before, stated Cary Sherman, 
president of the RIAA, in the 
press release.
Although strict in its stipula
tions, the initiative contains a 
clause allowing students to avoid 
the possibility of a lawsuit by the 
RIAA. This amnesty policy of
fers students the chance to sign 
admissions of guilt in return for 
an assurance that they will not be 
sued by RIAA agencies.
However, while the amnesty 
offers protection from the RIAA, 
it does not necessarily protect in
dividuals against civil lawsuits 
or criminal prosecution. For this 
reason, many remain skeptical 
of the policy, which is one of the 
initiatives key components.
[The RIAA] doesnt own any 
copyrights, and its member la
bels arent bound by this arrange
ment. This means that you could 
still be sued by the major record 
labels that fund the RIAA, song
writers, or any other copyright 
holders. Plus, the RIAA would
almost certainly turn over this 
information in response to any 
valid subpoena, according to the 
official website of the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation (EFF).
The EFF, founded in 1990, is 
a nonprofit agency defending 
users digital rights. The orga
nization criticizes the policies 
of copyright owners and larger 
organizations in the recording 
industry, including the RIAA.
Despite the efforts of these 
groups, the RIAA has continued 
to strengthen its enforcement 
policies.
The RIAA has launched a new 
website, www.p2plawsuits.com, 
to increase awareness of the new 
policies and serve as an informa
tional resource for individuals 
facing lawsuits.
Additionally, the company has 
developed an educational adver
tisements to be printed in college 
and university newspapers, 
which are expected to appear in 
the coming weeks.
The newspaper ads are meant 
to complement the RIAAs launch 
last fall of an orientation video 
that universities can screen to 
warn students about the conse
quences of illegal downloading. 
The vido is available atwww. 
campusdownloading.com.
As of July 2006, RIAA has sued 
over 20,000 music fans, includ
ing college students, for illegal 
file sharing.
There are many ways to avoid 
being one of them.
Students and administrators 
should not share files, which 
many do unknowingly. Most 
downloading clients offer users 
the option to turn off sharing. 
Students can also disable sharing 
by changing the options on their 
computers.
Of course, the foolproof way 
to avoiding punishment is to 
download digital music legally 
through accredited clients  or 
not to download at all.
ILLEGAL, from A1
RIAAs list, the universitys Of
fice of Information Security has 
reported an increase in the cease 
and desist orders it has received 
from various copyright holders.
These [orders] have risen 
steadily over the past year, said 
Mary Ann Blair, director of infor
mation security. In January, the 
Information Security Office re
ceived 56 orders, and this month 
we received 122.
While the RIAA has been filing 
user lawsuits since July 2003, the 
efforts have not stopped students 
from illegally downloading. 
Now, the RIAA has been forced 
to step up its procedures.
The new plan will focus on us
ers of Ares and Gnutella-based 
networks such as LimeWire. It 
will also encourage college cam
puses to strictly enforce their 
punishment policies as well as 
maintain technological devices 
to apprehend guilty students.
While Carnegie Mellon has 
shown no signs of changing its 
punishment policies for such 
actions, the university remains 
committed to apprehending all 
the students who are guilty.
In accordance with published 
policies and guidelines, the Com
puting Services information 
security [department] suspends 
systems identified in a credible 
cease and desist order for 45 days 
and notifies the registered sys
tem owner, Blair said.
Federal law mandates that 
universities that are notified 
that their students are illegally 
distributing copyrighted songs 
must act to stop repeat offend
ers or risk being sued, according 
to a February 26 article in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Annika Rosenvinge, a firstyear theater major, was recently

Eugenics exhibit makes stop at Andy Warhol Museum
by Sarah Mogin
Pillbox Editor
The Andy Warhol Museum is currently 
hosting Deadly Medicine, which is a trav
eling exhibit put together by the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum that depicts the eugenics
movement in Nazi Germany.
The Warhol is DeadlyMedicine's first stop 
on a five-year 
tour of museums 
throughout the 
country.
The next venue 
for the exhibit is 
the Center[s] for 
Disease Control at At
lanta, said Susan Bachrach, curator of special 
exhibitions at the United 
States Holocaust Memo
rial Museum. Deadly Medi
cine is set to appear at a wide 
variety of locations, each of 
which has its own method 
of interpreting and contextualizing the exhibit.
In addition to Atlanta, Deadly 
Medicine is set to appear at Gonzaga 
University, the University of Miami, 
and the New Mexico Holocaust and 
Intolerance Museum.
The Warhol, I thought, took a very in
teresting, creative approach, Bachrach 
said.
Last week, the Warhol incorporated 
Deadly Medicine into its Art, Science & 
Ethics Program series, which included a 
number of talks and lectures exploring the 
modern implications of eugenics.
Applying the Darwinian mantra of sur
vival of the fittest to humans, eugenics 
asserts that allowing individuals with 
weak genes to reproduce is detrimental 
to the human species.
According to a September 22, 2006, Ho
locaust Museum press release, proponents 
of eugenics can employ both positive 
and negative measures to control gene 
propagation.
On the positive side, a government can 
make efforts to improve the health and 
birth rate of a population by discourag
ing birth control and encouraging citizens 
to start families while young. Negative 
methods, such as sterilization laws for the 
disabled and mentally ill, involve an at
tempt to remove weak genes from 
the population.
The eugenics movement 
gained momentum in Ger- / 
many after the countrys loss in 
World War I. Social and po
litical unrest inspired many 
to turn to science for stability.
The Weimar government, a 
democracy, promoted posi
tive methods of eugenics.
Justin Brown/Photo Ed/to7
The 1933 rise of 
Nazism also brought 
about negative mea
sures of eugenics, 
which became part of a 
more extreme eugenics 
movement.
Eugenics is not unique to to to Germany. 
Other countries, including the United 
States, passed sterilization laws in the 
early 20th century.
However, only in Nazi Germany was 
eugenic sterilization implemented on a 
mass scale, and only there did it pave the 
road to mass murder, stated Bachrach in 
the press release.
Nazi eugenics sterilized an estimated 
400,000 mentally ill or disabled Germans. 
In addition, the regime murdered approxi
mately 5000 ill or disabled minors, as well 
as 200,000 mentally ill adults.
The Nazis carried out these murders 
through starvation and lethal injection, 
also utilizing gas chambers, which were 
later instrumental in the genocide 
of the Holocaust.
How did that happen? And 
where did individual values 
and responsibilities lie in the 
midst of that? asked Jessica 
Gogan, assistant director for 
education and interpretation 
at the Warhol. She said that 
these questions are important 
to following up on eugenics in 
Germany.
The White Space 
and White Coat Gallery 
in the fifth floor of the 
Warhol suggests that a 
possible explanation may 
of authority by doctors
within society. The installation contrasts 
the white coats worn by doctors with the 
white walls of contemporary art museums. 
According to the exhibit, whiteness repre
sents a change in the form of both art and 
medicine.
Doctors once wore dark-colored suits, 
and art galleries once featured 
colored walls on which works
hung from it floor to ceil
ing. Starting 
in the late 
19th century, 
however, 
white lab coats 
and white 
gallery walls 
became the 
norms of their 
respective fields. 
According to 
the. exhibit, white
ness also established a 
sort of transcendence in 
art and medicine. White 
coats emerged in medicine 
when hospitals, rather than 
households, became the pri
mary domain of treatment. 
Within a new and unpredict
able environment, white coats 
provided a way to separate doc
tors from their patients.
In art, on the other hand, the ex
pansive whiteness of gallery walls 
acts as a neutral background for the ab
stract, experimental art characteristic of 
the 20th and 21st centuries. In addition, it 
helps to establish the gallery as distinctly 
separate from the external world and in
fluences such as business and politics.

Carnegie Mellon hosts national linguistics olympiad
High school students in four cities will take on linguistics problems for a spot in the international competition
by Jun Xian Leong
Staffwriter
The first-ever North American 
Computational Linguistics Olym
piad (NAMCLO) will be held in 
Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, 
and Ithaca, as well as online for 
students who are unable to at
tend these venues, on March 29.
The local competition in Pitts
burgh will be hosted by Carnegie 
Mellon; professor Lori Levin of 
Carnegie Mellons Language 
Technologies Institute is the 
general chair of the national lin
guistics competition.
Computational linguistics is 
the study of natural language 
from a computational perspec
tive. The field involves studying 
applications of computers in lan
guage interpretation, as well as 
analysis of languages in a logical 
and systematic form.
In short, computational lin
guistics aims to make computers 
think more like human beings, 
so that interacting with a com
puter is more like interacting 
with a real person, said profes
sor of linguistics Thomas Payne, 
the second general chair of the 
competition, who teaches at the 
University of Oregon.
Payne said that the goals of 
computational linguistics include 
machine translation between 
natural languages, artificial in
telligence, handwriting and voice 
recognition, and text analysis 
. and processing.
The problems presented during 
NAMCLO will be representative 
of the challenges computational 
linguists face.
One of the example problems, 
for instance, involves decoding 
the meaning of individual words 
in an unknown language, given 
a few scrambled and unmatched 
sentences. Another problem ex
plores the most efficient way to
search a phone book for common 
last names.
I enjoyed the problems thor
oughly  [in past linguistics 
contests] we had to decipher 
texts in obscure languages, fig
ure out the Japanese calendar 
system, and discover vowel har
mony in Hungarian and Turkish, 
stated associate professor Dragomir Radev, who teaches in the 
department of linguistics at the 
University of Michigan.
The competitions goal is to 
unearth new talents in linguis
tics among high school students, 
as well as to heighten student 
awareness of linguistics.
Additionally, the competition 
is aimed at helping interested 
students pursue higher education 
in relevant fields such as compu
tational linguistics and human 
language technologies.
Local prizes include a copy of 
The Cambridge Encyclopedia of 
Language for the top three con
testants.
The four best students nation
wide will represent the United 
States at the International Lin
guistics Olympiad, which will be 
held in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 
early August.

Drug made to fight 
malaria in children
A new low-cost malaria 
drug has been developed and 
is aimed at children living in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Developed 
by European pharmaceutical 
giant Sanofi-Aventis and non
profit organization Drugs for 
Neglected Diseases Initiative 
(DNDI), this is a drug cocktail 
consisting of two effective pre
existing drugs, artesunate and 
amodiaquine, but made to be 
equally effective in smaller, 
more efficient doses.
Malaria is a highly infectious 
disease caused by parasites 
of the genus Plasmodium and 
transmitted by anopheles mos
quitoes. It kills more than three 
million people every year, with 
over one million of those casu
alties being African children.
The logic behind the drug 
cocktail is that with a combi
nation of two equally powerful 
drugs, one drug is bound to kill 
the parasite if the other fails. 
This also takes care of strains of 
the parasite that are becoming 
resistant to individual drugs.

Scientists discover 
fossils of organism
According to the most recent 
edition of the journal Science, 
scientists have discovered evi
dence of the existence of an 
organism named Orthrozanclus 
reburrus. Described as having 
many long curved spines ex
tending from an armored body, 
it supposedly crawled along the 
ocean floor over 505 million 
years ago, during the Cambrian 
period.
The organism was found in 
Canadas Burgess Shale rock 
formation. The invertebrates 
11 fossils were pieced together 
by scientists. It is said to have 
had no eyes or limbs, and is 
thought to have crawled along 
the ocean floor by means of a 
muscular foot.
The Cambrian period, 
brought on by the Cambrian 
explosion, is known for being 
a period during which many 
organisms first arose. It was 
also during this time that many 
animal forms first appeared 
in fossil records.

Countries to study 
global warming
This year, backed by the 
United Nations, over 60 coun
tries will begin scientific 
investigations of the Arctic 
and Antarctic in order to deter
mine whether global warming 
is thawing polar ice caps and 
causing rising sea levels.
Norwegian Prime Minister 
Jens Stoltenberg is insisting 
that visible climate change in 
the polar areas and the research 
conducted about it will give 
researchers critically neces
sary information about what to 
expect in terms of impending 
global warming, and that this 
information is crucial for all na
tions, not just those bordering 
polar regions.
This year, about 50,000 scien
tists will be conducting projects 
studying subjects such as ma
rine life, air pollutant patterns 
in the Arctic, and the health 
of arctic species such as polar 
bears and penguins. The con
cern about arctic temperatures 
rising twice as fast as those of 
the rest of the world could mean 
that sea levels will rise by 18 to 
59 centimeters.

How Things Work: Sunless tanning
David Kjos/Art Editor
Sunless tanning comes in a variety of forms, including sprays, pills, and powders.
Simran Grover
Sporting a bronze glow is a popular 
fad that has persisted all over the na
tion for many decades. Unfortunately, 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases 
the production of melanin in the body, 
which can lead to skin cancer. Because 
of these harmful effects from sunlight, 
many people have turned to sunless 
tanning options. Since the 1960s, many 
alternatives have arisen, such as beds, 
lotions, sprays, bronzers, and pills.
The skin is composed of primarily two 
layers: the epidermis on the outside and 
the dermis underneath. During tanning, 
but the epidermis is the most affected. 
The deepest layer in the epidermis, the 
stratum basale, is involved during sun 
tanning and the outermost layer in the 
epidermis, the stratum corneum, is in
volved during sunless tanning. Sunless 
tanning does not penetrate the skin as 
much as sun tanning  and the whole 
outermost layer of skin is replaced by 
new skin every 45 days.
Tanning by sunlight is harmful to the 
body. UV rays from the sun can cause 
skin cancer, and with prolonged expo
sure, signs of early aging like sun spots 
and wrinkles appear.
Sunless tanning helps reduce overall 
sunlight exposure. A common miscon
ception is that you need to stay in the sun 
for a long time to get enough vitamin D; 
in reality, even a little exposure to sun
light provides enough vitamin D for the 
body.
The first sunless tanning product 
was produced by Coppertone in 1960: 
QT, or Quick Tanning Lotion. This cream 
produced an orange color and did not 
last very long.
Today, indoor tanning is a $2 billion 
industry in the United States; there are 
25,000 tanning salons in this country 
alone. However, its not without a price: 
Women who visit tanning parlors more 
than 10 times a year have a seven times
..................................................._"
greater incidence of melanoma (a form 
of skin cancer) than women who did not 
use tanning salons. Increased use of tan
ning beds creates skin repair proteins, 
though; indoor tanning damages skin 
too, just in a different way than natu
ral sunlight. The UV light from tanning 
beds thins the skin and decreases its 
ability to heal. It also can cause prema
ture skin aging and is more likely to lead 
to wrinkled and sagging skin faster than 
normal. Since UV radiation can damage 
your skin regardless of the source, other 
methods are advised.
The American Academy of 
Dermatology recommends products
with dihydroxyactone (DHA) being the 
most effective and useful. DHA in lo
tions or sprays interacts with dead cells 
in the stratum corneum, causing a color 
change that lasts for about a week. These 
tans gradually fade because new skin 
grows while the old skin is worn away.
It is recommended to reapply the lo
tion every three days. Moisturizers are 
recommended to keep the top layer from 
shedding so quickly. With moisturizing, 
the tan will last longer. It is also recom
mended to exfoliate before tanning.
Exfoliating eliminates already-dead 
cells; this ensures that the tan will pig
ment cells that will live longer. Tanning
sprays create an even tone and are easy 
to use at home.
Tanning mists spray onto the body 
inside a booth. This is generally found 
in higher-end salons and spas. The 
spray is generally either water- or 
oil-based. People with sensitive skin 
should opt for a water base. The process 
eliminates smear lines and provides 
a natural-looking tan. It is not recom
mended for people who have excessively 
dry or flaky skin because spray tanning 
could result in an uneven tan.
Tanning accelerators contain tyro
sine and claim to stimulate and increase 
melanin formation. Melanin is the dark 
skin pigment that grows and spreads 
like a tan, and accelerating its produc
tion will also accelerate the tanning 
process. Research is still premature, and 
at the moment no data support these 
claims, but the products are available in 
the market.
Tanning pills contain canthaxanthin, 
a common ingredient in food coloring. 
The FDA has approved its use in food, 
but not in tanning. Once it is consumed, 
it is deposited all over the body and 
causes the skin to become an orangebrown color. This has led to a variety of 
side effects including yellow deposits in 
the eyes and hepatitis.
Bronzers are also a popular method. 
The powders and moisturizers produce 
a glow that can be easily removed by 
washing with soap and water. They are 
considered to be cosmetics and just tem: 
porarily tint the skin.
As long as you read up on the risks, 
sunless tanning can be a viable alterna
tive, especially for people who cannot 
tan naturally. People with fair skin, red 
hair, very light blonde hair, or freck
les, usually do not tan very well. These 
products are a better alternative to sun 
tanning or tanning beds, but using them 
will not protect you from UV radiation. 
Products with added sunscreen are not 
effective because it wears out in a few 
hours.

Olympiad tests reasoning skills
OLYMPIAD, from A6
The comptition is intended 
to draw students in grades nine 
through 12, but younger stu
dents who are interested in the 
field and capable of outstand
ing performance are welcome to 
participate. Currently, there are 
no plans to expand this competi
tion to include post-high school 
students.
NAMCLO will be an all new 
and self-sufficient competition, 
meaning that the questions will 
not require any prior training or 
special knowledge in linguistics
to complete, and they concern 
newly developed phenomena.
The problems are selfsufficient in the sense that no 
outside information (dictionar
ies, courses in the languages) is 
needed to solve them. They are 
based on pure logic and analytic 
reasoning, at a level that is totally 
appropriate for high school stu
dents, said Payne.
He added, It is entirely pos
sible to solve any of the problems 
with no linguistics or foreign lan
guage background. In previous 
trials, we have had sixth graders 
solve some of our most challenging problems. In many cases, the 
younger students can solve the 
problems more easily than can 
adults, because younger people 
have more flexible minds, and 
are more willing to enter into 
the logic of an unknown lan
guage than many adults are.
Another activity held by NAM
CLO is War of the Words, which 
is a post-competition activity in 
which the fictional United Na
tions Space Protection Agency 
needs to decipher an alien lan
guage in order to save the world.

Installation looks at art and medicine
EXHIBIT, from A6
Standing in this fifth-floor 
installation, University of Pitts
burgh bioethics professor David 
Barnard gave a lecture called 
The Cultural Authority of Medi
cine  for Good and 111 last 
Thursday. Barnard examined the 
role of doctors throughout time, 
beginning with the ancient Greek 
physicians, which was the time of 
Hippocrates.
In particular, Barnard com
pared the text of the Hippocratic 
Oath, which was also on display 
in the White Space exhibit, to the 
actions of doctors in Nazi Ger
many. Doctors who had sworn to, 
as the oath says, be the good of 
the sick to the utmost of [their] 
power, were also largely respon
sible for creating the technology 
used in gas chambers.
We suspend our own judg
ment and defer to the judgment
of some others, Barnard ex
plained, discussing the authority 
of doctors. According to Barnard, 
white coats, coupled with the 
emergence of specialized tools 
such as X-rays and stethoscopes, 
elevated the role of doctors to an 
elite and specialized status.
The publics trust in doctors is 
still evident today, he explained. 
Whereas ancient Greeks thought 
it unethical to treat the termi
nally ill because it went against 
nature, modern society often 
expects its doctors to attempt to 
overcome the unnatural.
Overall, Deadly Medicine por
trays a reminder of what results 
when the authority of medicine 
oversteps its bounds.
It was [in Washington] a very, 
very successful exhibition, Bachrach said. I think the content 
was powerful and the design was 
beautiful.
A version of the original Wash
ington, D.C., exhibit, by the same 
designer, is currently on display 
in the German Hygiene Museum 
in Dresden.
The Hygiene Museum, now a 
host to this grim reminder of the 
past, was once a tribute to Ger
man eugenics. >
We begin with a model from 
that museum, Bachrach ex
plained, referring to the glass 
man, a model of the human 
anatomy depicting the ideal of 
superior genes.
The German Deadly Medicine 
exhibit has the intention of re
futing strands of anti-Semitism, 
Neo-Nazism, and Holocaust de
nial in Europe.
Wed never traveled an exhibit 
abroad, and we certainly hadnt 
done one in Germany, Bachrach 
continued. So that was very, 
very exciting.
Deadly Medicine is on display at 
the Warhol until March 18.

National chapter of Delta Zeta discriminates on the basis of weight, attractiveness
U.S.-Mexico border control 
raises human rights concerns
Greek fraternities originated in 1776 
with the establishment of a secret society 
called Phi Beta Kappa. The organization 
chose to represent itself with the Greek 
letters that began the most important 
words in their motto Philosophia bios 
kybernethes, or Philosophy is the guide 
to life. Phi Beta Kappa eventually went 
public, and groups of fraternities slowly 
spread to academic institutions around 
the country.
Fraternities and sororities are 
anchored to the ideals of leadership, ser
vice, scholarship, and friendship, and yet 
popular stereotypes of Greek life lead us 
to believe that the core priorities of these 
organizations are more along the lines 
of partying, image, and exclusion. For 
example, historically black fraternities 
like Alpha Phi Alpha, formed in 1906 
at Cornell University, were founded 
primarily because existing Greek orga
nizations created exclusionary policies 
based on race and religious beliefs. Of 
course, racially discriminatory policies 
are no longer a permissible part of mod
ern Greek life.
Despite a philosophy promoting 
friendship, Greek organizations over 
the past decade have repeatedly made 
news with disturbing hazing rituals that 
serve only to degrade and dehuman
ize rushees and that sometimes end in
Beer is king among the college kind. 
Whether its stout, ale, lager, or ultra 
light, theres a libation for anyone with 
a discerning palate for brew  and with 
local bars selling dollar drafts some 
nights, theres a brew even for the dis
cerning wallet. But soon that $1 price 
tag may reach upwards of a buck fifty.
The price of barley, one of beers main 
ingredients, has been on the rise for the 
past five years, while barley production 
has decreased by almost 15 percent 
since last year. According to statistics 
released by the U.S. Department of Ag
riculture, average prices have steadily 
risen, ending at $3.16 per bushel at the 
end of December 2006  nearly a 24 
percent increase from the end of 2005.
Essentially, farmers are finding its a 
lot more lucrative to grow other crops 
instead of barley, particularly corn. Corn 
has been the king of cash crops for quite 
some time: Its a favorite vegetable for
hospitalization or death. While a recent 
event at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind., may not have put sorority 
rushees in the way of extreme physical 
harm, it certainly served to degrade and 
discriminate.
The Delta Zeta sorority at DePauw 
had a campus reputation for being so
cially awkward, according to DePauw 
psychology professor Pam Propsom, 
who surveys her class each year about 
sorority stereotypes on campus. Delta 
Zetas national chapter was concerned 
that the nerdy image of DePauws Delta 
Zeta sisters was severely impacting re
cruitment, so the national chapter came 
to DePauw to conduct individual inter
views to ascertain sisters commitment 
to sorority recruitment.
Following the interviews, on Decem
ber 2, 2006, 23 of Delta Zetas members 
received letters from the national chap
ter recommending them for alumna 
status, an underhanded euphemism ef
fectively kicking them out of the chapter 
and even evicting them from the soror
ity house. All 23 of the evicted members 
happened to be overweight or not con
ventionally attractive, while the measly 
12 members asked to stay were slim and 
pretty. Six of the remaining 12 Delta 
Zeta sisters were outraged by the na
tional representatives decision and imhuman consumption and one of the top 
ingredients used to feed livestock. It can 
be converted into corn syrup (used to 
help quench Americans thirst for soda) 
and into ethanol for car fuel.
Even the U.S. government supports 
corn, subsidizing its production to make 
it almost easy money for farmers. For 
instance, say that it costs farmers $1.20 
to produce one bushel of corn, but con
sumers are only willing to pay 80 cents 
for a bushel. The government subsidy 
will then pay the 40-cent difference to 
the farmers, plus extra so that the farm
ers make a profit.
Because of corn subsidies, even the 
most beer-devoted barley farmer is 
tempted to begin growing corn instead. 
For beer drinkers, a decreasing number 
of barley farms means less barley to go 
into the beer.
It should be no surprise, then, that two 
large beer breweries, Anheuser-Busch of
mediately withdrew from the sorority.
Delta Zetas, before the mass eviction, 
were characterized as being focused on 
academics. They enjoyed each others 
company and were a tight-knit sister
hood. They seemed to espouse the prin
ciples of Greek life very well. Unfortu
nately, an overwhelming number of the 
sisters were eliminated because they 
did not fit a specific aesthetic archetype. 
Twenty-three girls have had to deal with 
the humiliation of being kicked out of 
their sorority because of their physical 
appearance. DePauw University stu
dents and faculty are outraged at the 
national chapter for the humiliation and 
disruption it has caused on campus.
Delta Zetas national representatives 
have gone entirely against the founding 
principles of Greek organizations. Their 
judgments were unhealthy and wrong, 
both for ex-Delta Zetas and the DePauw 
campus as a whole.
Perhaps Greek organizations need to 
get back to their roots. Worry less about 
image and more about academics and 
service. Unite people rather than ex
clude them. Greek life should reconsider 
its founding principles and ensure that 
they are adhered to in such a way that 
they enhance the campus communities 
rather than fall into the trap of imagebased stereotyping.
St. Louis and Mexican bottling company 
Femsa, both announced they would be 
raising prices early this year. Budweiser 
and Corona fans alike may have to dig 
a little deeper into their pockets to pay 
for beer.
Besides raising beer prices, corn subsi
dies could also affect health. As reported 
by the environmental magazine Grist, 
the large subsidy on corn makes it much 
cheaper for food and drink companies 
to sweeten their products with corn 
syrup instead of granular sugar. The 
problem? Corn syrup contains a signifi
cantly higher amount of glucose than 
other sweeteners, a trait that has been 
linked to an increase in the occurrence 
of Type II diabetes.
The phrase Cut the fat could soon 
become Cut the corn. Reducing corn 
subsidies, and therefore reducing the 
amount of corn produced, would keep us 
happy (low beer prices!) and healthy.
_____________________Jessica Thurston
In a New York Times article from Feb
ruary 21, journalist James C. McKinley 
Jr. detailed the current efforts of the 
U.S. Border Patrol and their suppos
edly courageous battle along the United 
States-Mexico border. Adding to the 
current highly biased debate over how 
to handle illegal immigration in the 
United States, McKinleys article per
petuates the stereotype that American 
patriotism is defined solely by camou
flage desert gear and a determination to 
exterminate the rats contaminating our 
economy. In this sense, if we want to call 
ourselves patriotic Americans, it seems 
like we must support the Border Patrol 
and their overzealous, un-thought-out 
tactics.
At first glance, the bias in the border 
immigration debate appears to be based 
in an us-versus-them mentality. That 
is, we do not want undocumented mi
grants in our country because they are 
not Americans; they are different from 
us. In this sense, what place do they 
have taking part unequally in our pros
perous American economy?
But what about real American his
tory? The intrinsic instability of the 
U.S.-Mexico border region is centuries 
old. The region is plagued by cultural 
paradoxes and contradictions perpetu
ated by the ambiguous nature of the 
border itself. The melding of Mexican 
and American cultures is as much a 
part of the arid landscape as the rusted 
barbed wire fence slicing through the 
barren stretch of territory. The culture 
along the border is one that is highly 
complex, defined by years of migration 
and overlap in language, customs, and 
politics. Contradiction, while itself a 
vague concept, is wholly part of this cul
tural landscape.
Because of the fluid, inconsistent 
nature of the border region, the hid
den bias in the argument over illegal 
immigration in the U.S. is one of hu
man rights: We tend to see ourselves as 
civilized and the migrants as animalis
tic and savage, when we should just be 
protecting everyones human rights to 
life and freedom. Shouldnt American 
patriotism be defined by support and 
defense of the freedom of every individ
ual, regardless of his or her race or cul
tural origin? If these illegal immigrants 
are entering the U.S. by means of crawl
ing across a dusty desert and through 
sewage tunnels, seemingly reduced to 
animals, why cant our government see 
that they are in desperate need of eco
nomic stability and humanitarian pro
tection?
Instead of thinking about the real 
reason why these people are crossing  
to save their families, to find economic 
stability, to find cultural or political 
independence, not to intentionally un
dermine the American economy  the 
Border Patrol is stepping up measures 
to keep them out and then celebrat
ing doing so. In McKinleys article, he 
writes about the most recent projects 
imposed on the region by the Border 
Patrol, stressing its supposed success in 
the border territory.
In the last four months, the number 
[of migrants caught] has dropped 27 
percent compared with the same pe
riod last year, according to the Times
article. Perhaps coincidentally, the Bor
der Patrol has also received increased 
funding for putting more officers on 
constant patrol along rivers and moni
toring surveillance cameras, placing 
stadium lights to highlight individuals, 
and erecting secondary fences. Mexi
cans are trapped unknowingly, only 
to be promptly removed by the patrol 
force.
Instead of trying to completely re
verse the borders innate qualities of 
fluidity and instability, why isnt the 
U.S. government spending money on 
problems within our own country, or 
at least on protecting  not harming
 these hard-pressed migrants? Con
stantly stepping up the Border Patrols 
technology has proved expensive and 
futile in the past  there are plenty 
of undocumented migrants living and 
working in the U.S. today.
Tony Payan, in his 2006 book titled 
Three U.S.-Mexico Border Wars: Drugs, 
Immigration, and Homeland Security, 
presents the facts on the Border Patrols 
budget. According to Payans research, 
between 1986 and 2000, the budget 
increased from $200 million to over 
$1 billion, and its personnel increased 
from 2000 to 12,000. The 2007 bud
get calls for the deployment of another 
1500 agents.
A common misperception perpetu
ated in McKinleys article is that funding 
and personnel increases actually work. 
The article stated that there are signs 
that the measures the Border Patrol and 
other federal agencies have taken over 
the last ye^r ... are beginning to slow 
the flow of illegal immigrants. While 
McKinley does acknowledge that this 
presumption is weakly supported, based 
solely on the measurement of how many 
migrants are actually caught, the Bor
der Patrol and Homeland Security do 
not seem to want to acknowledge the 
fact that migrants will continue to find
other, more dangerous means of pen
etrating the border. We are comfort
able that this actually reflects a change 
in momentum, Secretary of Homeland 
Security Michael. Chertoff declared in 
an interview in February.
Moreover, the Times article de
scribed a particularly horrific example 
of what American patriotism has come 
to be identified as. In a trial of 78 mi
grants (represented by a single lawyer) 
who had been caught after attempt
ing to cross the border into the U.S., a 
51-year-old man trying to work in San 
Antonio to pay for his sons college tu
ition was sent to jail for entering the 
country and trying to find stable work. 
But he acknowledged that the stint in 
jail had persuaded him not to try again, 
even if his son must drop out. No way, 
he said, shaking his head. Congratula
tions, Border Control: you just made the 
economic situation in Mexico, which we 
should be trying to help stabilize, that 
much worse.
The question of undocumented mi
grants living and working in the U.S. 
should not be a game of cat and mouse, 
but instead, one of preserving the dig
nity of Latin American and U.S. citizens 
by recognizing and supporting the 
rights to life, freedom, and protection 
innate to all individuals.

To kill a Mumia: Racism still prevails in the U.S. legal system
Justin Brown
John Doe, an acclaimed jour
nalist and scholar, is driving 
around Philadelphia one night 
when he sees his brother being 
arrested. He stops his car; th 
curtain falls. Curtain rises  
more police arrive at the scene. 
The man arresting Does brother 
is shot dead, and Doe is sitting 
on the curb, bleeding badly from 
a bullet wound. The police beat 
Doe brutally, smashing his head 
against the curb and a light post 
and delay getting him medical 
attention. Does registered gun is 
found near the scene.
An initial report from the 
autopsy reveals that the bul
let that killed the police officer 
was of a different caliber than 
Does gun: It could not have been 
fired from the gun registered to 
Doe. Several days later, the fo
rensic pathologist retracts his 
statement, saying that the bullet 
was in fact the same caliber. The 
bullet mysteriously disappeared 
from the evidence collected.
Does lawyer says he doesnt 
want the case. The judge forces 
him to keep it. Doe requests to 
represent himself in the court
room. The judge denies this 
request, and instead removes 
Doe from the courtroom. Much 
of the trial is held without the 
defendant present. The judge 
is heard by witnesses  a court 
stenographer and another judge
 saying Im going to help [the
jury] fry the nigger.
Yes, John is black. His real 
name is Mumia Abu-Jamal, he 
has dreadlocks, he was driving 
a cab when he saw his brother, 
and hes a political activist. He 
has been on death row for 25 
years, and now sits an hour south 
of Pittsburgh in a maximumsecurity prison waiting to die.
I first learned of this case when 
I went to hear Abu-Jamals cur
rent lawyer, Robert Bryan, speak 
on the topic. I was incredulous. 
How could an American citizen 
be so blatantly denied his basic 
constitutional rights? How could 
outright racism be supported by 
entire respected groups of peo
ple, like the Fraternal Order of 
Police?
On December 6,2006, the U.S. 
House of Representatives passed 
a resolution condemning the 
city of St. Denis, France, for nam
ing a street Mumia Abu-Jamal. 
The resolution also commends 
all police officers in the United 
States and throughout the world 
for their commitment to pub
lic service and public safety 
(HR407). While I commend the 
House for its sense of priority 
(glad that whole war situation is 
out of the way), I condemn them 
for actively supporting racism 
and injustice in the legal system.
I cannot fathom how this man 
is still in prison. There stands 
very clear evidence that, at the 
least, Abu-Jamal was not given a 
fair trial, to which all Americans 
are entitled. A man is sitting on 
death row because he is outspo
ken, educated, and black. If he
can be given a fair trial in which 
it can be proven beyond question 
that he shot and killed police of
ficer Danny Faulkner, then we 
can talk about punishment. I, for 
one, still have reasonable doubt.
Even if Abu-Jamal were unde
niably guilty  even if he were 
recorded on video  he should 
not be on death row. Death row is 
reserved for first-degree murder
ers. Even if Mumia Abu-Jamal 
had shot and killed the police 
officer, how could it, given the 
situation, be counted as premed
itated murder? Easily! By using 
exorbitantly circumstantial evi
dence. In Abu-Jamals trial, the 
prosecutor quoted Abu-Jamal 
as saying (over 12 years prior), 
Political power grows out of 
the barrel of a gun, and used 
the statement as evidence of his 
violent state of mind. Abu-Jamal 
fully admits saying this. Its a 
quote from Mao Tse-Tung, and 
Abu-Jamal says that America 
has proven it correct (referring 
to taking America from Native 
Americans). This quote served 
as Abu-Jamals premeditation for 
the murder of Danny Faulkner. 
Again I raise the question: How 
can this man possibly still be sit
ting on death row?
Something has to be done. 
This is a mans life were talking 
about. Whether you want to view 
him as a political symbol or not, 
he is in line to be unjustifiably ex
ecuted. Regardless of your views 
on capital punishment (Im not 
sure, myself), this man cannot 
be killed by our judicial system.
Im calling on anyone reading
this article to at least educate 
yourselves about the case. Keep 
in mind that there is no real story 
(see the film Rashomori). So much 
evidence has been fabricated, 
lost, twisted, and come from 
people who have later admitted 
to lying, that there is no definite 
answer to the crime. Its hard to 
find an unbiased record of it. But 
just because we dont know who 
did it doesnt mean Mumia AbuJamal has to die.
Im calling on Carnegie Mellon 
to release a public statement con
demning the injustice of Mumias 
trial. Listen, I know Governor 
Rendell wont like you as much, 
but some things have to go 
beyond outside political perspec
tive. We should set a precedent, 
especially because of our prox
imity to Waynesburg (where 
Abu-Jamal sits).
Im calling on the Free Mumia 
movement to revitalize itself.
Yes, the case has lasted quite a 
long time, and may seem slow 
at times (welcome to the judi
cial branch), but you must keep 
active. Mumia must be given a 
retrial and taken off death row 
if the American judicial system 
wants to retain its dignity.
Im calling on Governor 
Rendell to reverse his support 
for Abu-Jamals execution. Se
riously, look at the facts. You 
cannot sign this mans death 
warrant and still call yourself an 
American. Please read the Sixth 
and Fourteenth Amendments of 
the United States Constitution.
Lock up all the murderers you 
want, if you can catch them, 
but remember: Its a sin to kill 
Mumia.

Killer robots pose moral and branding issues for University
Kelly Cahill & Kristen Lukiewski
The Gladiator is a vehicle that 
looks like a miniature cross be
tween a tank and a Jeep. It can 
climb over huge mounds of rock 
and navigate an urban jungle. 
It is a remote-controlled robot 
equipped with cameras that can 
see through smoke and darkness. 
If it seems like an awesome toy, 
keep in mind that as it conquers 
terrain both rugged and urban, 
the Gladiator can launch tear gas 
and flashbang grenades, or spray 
a hail of bullets from a swiveling 
machine gun atop the vehicle.
Robots that can kill are no 
longer confined to science fic
tion  these weapons are being 
produced right here at Carnegie 
Mellon. The Gladiator was 
created by the National Robotics 
Engineering Center (NREC), the 
Carnegie Mellon Robotics Insti
tutes commercial branch-off. In 
2005, the United States Marine 
Corps gave NREC $26.4 million 
to produce Gladiator prototypes.
Last Friday, political activists 
from the Pittsburgh Organizing 
Group (POG) blocked the en
trances to NRECs facility in 
Lawrenceville to protest the 
production of weapons of war 
like the Gladiator. Part of POGs 
complaints about the NREC 
and federally funded research 
at Carnegie Mellon is that stu
dents may not be aware of how 
much money governmental 
agencies like the Department of 
Defense (DoD) are pouring into
our university. Carnegie Mellon 
students should be aware that 
military funding has become 
pervasive on campus. Beyond the 
School of Computer Science and 
its Robotic Institute, funds also 
find their way into departments 
like psychology and philosophy 
without students knowledge.
Robotics Institute affiliates 
like NREC and the Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI) were 
initially established with federal 
money. NREC received a $2.4 
million grant from NASA to help 
get started, and the SEI is com
pletely federally funded. The 
program was established in 1984 
with $103 million of DoD money, 
and it received another $411 mil
lion contract in 2005. Carnegie 
Mellon is now one of the largest 
academic military contractors 
in the U.S., among universities 
like MIT and Johns Hopkins. 
The university has become such 
a powerhouse for military re
search that it even beat out ad
vanced tech company Lockheed 
Martin for the multi-million dol
lar Gladiator contract.
NRECs Gladiator robot is part 
of Congress National Defense 
Authorization Act of 2001, which 
seeks to convert at least one-third 
of the Armed Forces ground vehi
cles to being unmanned by 2015 
in an attempt to save American 
lives in wartime. On its website, 
NREC says that it pursued pro
posals by the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (a part 
of DoD), the Army Research Lab, 
and the Office of Naval Research 
because it was well-equipped to 
do so and because it was excited 
about the force .protection mis
sion enabled by UGV [unmanned
ground vehicle] technology.
The move towards unmanned 
weapons of warfare and Carn
egie Mellons participation in the 
development of this technology 
are not reason for celebration. 
While UGVs will undoubtedly 
save American lives in Iraq and 
future combat, they do not take 
into account the lives of en
emies. UGVs may remove the 
discomfort of taking another 
human beings life, but that only 
makes it easier to kill. Moreover, 
these types of weapons will' 
change the entire cost/benefit 
analysis of war in an incredibly 
anti-humanitarian way. If loss of 
American life is dramatically re
duced in direct combat, it will be 
easier for the American mindset 
to pursue further imperial action 
and force our form of govern
ment and culture on the world 
community.
This also contributes to an 
inherent branding issue at Carn
egie Mellon. A recent poll in Th 
Washington Post cites that nearly 
75 percent of U.S. residents think 
the number of casualties in Iraq is 
unacceptable, and nearly 60 per
cent think the war was not worth 
fighting  in fact, the number of 
people who negatively associate 
this war with Vietnam is on the 
rise. Meanwhile, youth voting 
numbers surge with each elec
tion and lean democract. One 
breakdown shows that students 
who major in subjects such as sci
ence and engineering, social sci
ences, and humanities and arts
 three of Carnegie Mellons 
biggest attractors  were more 
likely to choose Kerry over Bush. 
The two factors youths were most 
concerned with? Moral values
and the situation in Iraq.
The government funding of 
the Robotics Institute seems to 
be a bragging point for Carnegie 
Mellon, but given the political 
leanings of potential and current 
students, its hard to see why. 
Supporting the war by provid
ing research for machines that 
kill is counterintuitive to attract
ing and keeping students  and 
graduating satisfied students is 
key to receiving donations from 
alumni that in turn help our en
dowment grow. As it stands now, 
were increasingly being branded 
as a tool of the U.S. government. 
The nickname Carnegie Military 
University has even taken over 
in some circles outside campus.
The universitys projected im
age conflicts with the real-life 
Carnegie Mellon. The universi
tys mission statement includes 
serving students by teaching 
them ... the value of a commit
ment to ... ethical behavior, 
society, and respect for one an
other as well as pursuing the 
advantages provided by a diverse 
... community open to the ex
change of ideas, where discov
ery, creativity, and personal ... 
development can flourish, yet it 
also allows ROTC, which keeps 
the Dont ask, dont tell, dont 
pursue, policy, to maintain their 
presence on campus. We would 
benefit from choosing a mission 
statement were willing to en
force, both through inclusion of 
some groups and organizations 
and exclusion of others.
There are ways to keep our 
mission statement alive and keep 
the government out. The NREC 
website states that Carnegie Mel
lons Robotics Institute is the
worlds largest robotics research 
and development organiza
tion. With so many skills and 
capabilities available, there are 
as many ways to focus and de
velop our skills into progressive 
and humanitarian products. For 
as much as the Gladiator will 
destroy lives, there are ways to 
redirect our learning and re
search towards things that will 
enhance lives instead.
Meet Tank, the roboceptionist for the School of Computer 
Science, who answers questions 
and even tells stories. Meet 
Pearl, a Nursebot that resulted 
from a collaborative project be
tween Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh, and is 
a personal assistant for elderly 
people. Meet the Hug, a product 
of the design and -humancomputer interaction programs 
that uses sensors and wireless 
technology within a pillow to 
provide emotional support  in 
the form of a hug  for people 
whose loved ones might be too 
far away to provide it for them.
These are the kinds of robot
ics projects Carnegie Mellon 
should be proud to tout  those 
that have the bettering of peo
ples lives in mind. Its time to 
break away from government 
funding, to break away from 
being a cog in a war machine, 
and stand up for whats right 
both publicly and privately. Its 
in everyones best interests to 
separate ourselves from the 
government, and from creating 
soulless killing machines.

New medium 
for campus 
conversations
-----
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
We have town hall meetings, 
forums, and MiscMarket bul
letins for the purpose of airing 
thoughts about campus contro
versies. Still, sometimes campus 
issues arent voiced at all. We 
think this is inadequate.
Students need a medium where 
their concerns can be addressed, 
discussed, and responded to by 
the community. We need to be 
able to talk about the type of 
environment we want Carnegie 
Mellon to be, our concept of di
versity, and what distracts us 
from our goal to learn.
This past Tuesday, we held an 
open meeting to discuss these 
issues. Wed like to thank all the 
students who participated. Stu
dents are interested in building 
community and debating the dif
ficult issues. They want to make 
sure that each voice is heard ev
ery time a controversy occurs. 
The students at the meeting on 
Tuesday came up with several 
good points, which we will work 
on incorporating into a policy.
The students suggestions will 
form the base structure for a 
new conversation medium. Wed 
like to outline some points that 
students felt were particularly 
relevant.
First of all, we should get to
gether to discuss campus values 
in a public place. Anyone walking 
by should be able to hear whats 
going on and join in. Meetings 
should happen about three or 
four times a year: frequently 
enough that theyre expected, 
but not so often that they become 
a chore.
There should also be an online 
component. Some students are 
more comfortable online, while 
others are more comfortable 
speaking verbally.
We should have mediators in 
the public conversations who 
can bring out the reasons why 
students make the statements 
they make. What values are be
ing challenged, or are causing 
the debate? Mediators could 
make sure that everyones voice 
is heard, and that arguments are 
fully fleshed out and understand
able.
Finally, a statement should 
be generated from each con
versation that will be released 
to the campus community. It 
should highlight the points of 
the discussion where there were 
agreements and disagreements. 
The statement could perhaps 
also include suggestions that 
were generated during the. dis
cussion of how to move forward 
as a community.
This is our school. Lets talk to
gether about the kind of campus 
we want it to be.

this issue, please email sbp@ or

JBBlt Dickson, provided funds in their wills for
| Carnegie Mellon University to award an
annual prize to individuals who make 
JfcL outstanding contributions to science in the
Scientist and author Jared Diamond 
I has set out to do nothing less than
i/TrSfm h explain how, since the dawn of human
or. jared Diamond history, societies worldwide have evolved,
prospered and ultimately collapsed. His 
Pulitzer Prize winning book Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fate of Human 
Societies," explored the geographic, environmental and epidemiological 
factors that enabled some societies to progress rapidly while others 
remained primitive. Those that prospered conquered and subjugated 
those that didnt.
in his latest book, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or 
Succeed." Diamond probes the decline and fall of once-prosperous 
civilizations, such as the prehistoric Polynesian society of Easter Island, 
the medieval Viking colony of Greenland and the Native American 
civilizations of the Maya and the Anasazi. Diamond demonstrates 
several environmental and political factors that are common to these 
catastrophes and which provide lessons for today.
A physiologist by training, Diamond is a professor of geography at 
the University of California, Los Angeles. For many years he studied the 
cellular and molecular mechanisms of ion, water and nonelectrolyte 
transport across biological membranes. He has pursued a parallel 
career in ecology and evolutionary biology, based on expeditions to 
study the birds of New Guinea. Diamond is the author of The Third 
Chimpanzee and Why is Sex Fun? His numerous awards and honors 
include a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, or Genius" award.

Tartan track teams 
compete at UAAs

Staffwriter
Last weekend, the Carnegie 
Mellon track and field teams 
traveled to Brandeis University to 
compete in the long-anticipated 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) indoor championships. 
The mens team placed third 
with 88 points, behind Wash
ington University and Emory 
University.
The womens team finished 
sixth out of seven teams, with 22 
points, improving on their lastplace finish last year.
On the mens side, senior Nich
olas Bannister set another school 
record, winning the 55-meter 
hurdles with a time of 7.72. Ju
nior Kiley Williams followed to 
finish in third place with a time 
of 8.05. Senior sprinter Russel 
Verbofsky finished fifth in the 
200-meter dash with a time of 
23.18.
In the distance events, sopho
more Brian Harvey (4:13.36) 
led the team with a secondplace finish in the one-mile run. 
Behind Harvey, senior Geoff 
Misek (4:24.73) and junior Drew 
Miller (4:26.78) placed eighth 
and 13th, respectively. In the 
800-meter run, senior Davey
Quinn finished third with a time 
of 1:55.31.
Although I am frustrated that 
I was unable to pull off the win 
in the mile, it will provide ex
tra motivation at nationals next 
weekend in Indiana, Harvey 
said.
Sophomore Breck Fresen 
came in 10th in the 3000-meter 
run with a time of 9:04.90 and 
12th in the 5000-meter run with 
a time of 15:35.00. First-year 
Dario Donatelli finished behind 
Fresen in the 5000-meter run 
in 14th place with a time of 
15:39.31.
In the field events, senior Eric 
Tang won the triple jump (13.45 
meters) and came in second in 
the long jump (6.67 meters). 
Sophomore Joel Palko (13.19 
meters) and junior Eric Couphos 
(12.49 meters) finished third 
and 10th in the triple jump, re
spectively. Palko also came in 
seventh place in the long jump 
(6.09 meters). In the high jump,

SPORTS COMMENTARY
College basketball heats 
up for March
Doug Fricker
With the college basketball 
regular season essentially 
wrapped up, teams are pre
paring for their conference 
tournaments with the aspira
tions of dancing, i.e., earning 
a bid to the NCAA college bas
ketball tournament.
This years regular season 
continued an interesting 
parity within the sport. The 
traditional powerhouses 
arent their usual dominant 
selves, and the teams at the 
top of the rankings arent as 
unbeatable as in the past.
In addition, teams from 
smaller conferences crept 
into the top 25 early and of
ten this season. Put all these 
elements together and youve 
a bubbling, volatile melting 
pot, setting up one of the most 
wide-open tournaments in 
history.
On Sunday the bracket will 
be revealed, with the tourna
ments first round occurring 
on the following Thursday 
and Friday. The fate of many 
teams will hinge on their per
formances in their conference 
tournaments, as the winner of 
those tournaments automati
cally qualify for the NCAA 
tournament. Thirty-one teams 
will qualify this way, while the 
remaining 34 teams must wait 
for Selection Sunday and pray 
that the selection committee 
sees their strengths and not 
their faults.
Take a look at the topranked teams in the country, 
and youll see they have flaws 
of their own. Im not con
vinced they are a cut above the 
rest. The Ohio State Buckeyes, 
ranked number one in both 
polls, do have a 14-game win
ning streak; however, in two 
of those games, the Buckeyes 
barely prevailed against Penn 
State, the last-place team in 
the Big Ten. The Buckeyes are 
insanely talented, but they 
have five first-years playing 
extensive minutes.
UCLA, Wisconsin, and Flor
ida are all in the top five, yet 
all three were upset recently. 
The Bruins lost to the un
ranked Washington Huskies; 
Wisconsin lost to unranked 
Michigan State and then fell to 
the Buckeyes. Florida, the de
fending national champions, 
lost to Vanderbilt, LSU, and 
Tennessee. North Carolina, 
highly ranked until recently, 
lost back-to-back games to
Maryland and Georgia Tech 
in Atlantic Coast Conference 
(ACC) action.
With the teams at the top 
not exactly cruising into the 
tournament, we also have the 
perennial top programs not 
flying so high and smoothly 
as wed expect. Connecti
cut (1999 and 2004 national 
champions) and Duke (2001 
champions), both number-one 
seeds last season, have strug
gled at times this season.
Connecticut will need to 
win the Big East tournament 
just to make the NCAA tour
nament, and Duke has fallen 
to an uncharacteristic sixth 
place in the ACC. Add in the 
fact that Kentucky (1996 and 
1998 champions), Michigan 
State (2000 champions), and 
Arizona (1997 champions) are 
currently unranked, and the 
melting pot that is college bas
ketball is as volatile as ever.
Mix in the mid-majors 
(teams from smaller confer
ences) to this melting pot 
and start stirring. Nevada, 
a member of the Western 
Athletic Conference, is not a 
newcomer to the scene, be
ing a number-five seed in last 
years tournament. The Wolf 
Pack is ranked in the top 10 
and Southern Illinois, a mem
ber of the Missouri Valley 
Conference (MVC), is ranked 
number 11.
The MVC is quickly shed
ding its reputation as a 
mid-major, getting four tour
nament berths last season. 
Also, the Butler Bulldogs, from 
the Horizon League, won the 
Preseason NIT in November 
and have remained in the top 
25 since.
If you single out one of 
these factors, then this argu
ment isnt very strong. But 
combining the facts that the 
traditional powerhouses 
arent as strong as usual, the 
top teams in the country arent 
flawless, and the mid-majors 
are making lots of noise results 
in an unknown concoction in 
this melting pot.
Whats missing is the mys
terious elixir that masks the 
unpleasant taste of the con
coction and reveals the secret 
to how this years tournament 
will unfold. Im not going to 
lead you on, no elixir exists. 
Youre on your own as you pre
dict the outcome of this years 
NCAA tournament. Just keep 
in mind, anything can, and 
usually does, happen during 
the madness that is March.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team ended its season 
last Wednesday when it lost in 
the first round of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) 
South Region tournament 84-75 
at the hands of the Lebanon Val
ley Flying Dutchmen.
The Tartans earned a bid to the 
tournament after finishing 12-12 
in the regular season.
Last Wednesday the Tartans,
seeded sixth in the eight-team 
tournament, traveled east to 
Annville, Pa., to play the thirdseeded Flying Dutchmen, who 
came into the game with a record 
of 14-11.

the opening minute of the game. 
After a basket at the other end, 
Kozak hit another three, putting 
the Tartians up 6-2.
The Tartans lead ballooned to 
21-9 at the 12:09 mark, in what 
would end up being their biggest 
lead of the game.
At this point, the Flying Dutch
men lowered the deficit some 
before a three-pointer from se
nior guard Brad Matta increased 
the Tartans lead back into double 
digits at 30-19 with 6:40 remain
ing. The Tartans saw their lead cut 
to 39-33 heading into halftime, 
with Kozak scoring a team-high 
12 points in the first half.
In the second half, the Flying 
Dutchmen took their first lead of 
the game, 44-42, with 17 min
utes remaining. The Tartans kept 
their poise and retook the lead 
shortly thereafter thanks to an
other Kozak three-pointer.
Two free throws at the 8:41 
mark from first-year guard Jack 
Anderson provided the Tartans 
with a 63-56 lead. Lebanon 
Valley scored on its next four 
possessions, tying the game at 65 
in the process.
The Flying Dutchmen scored 
seven more points in a row to

Two weeks ago, the Tartans 
club ice hockey team drew 
a crowd to see the team play 
Bucknell University in its fi
nal home game of the season.
Last weekend, the team left for 
Buffalo, where it lost 7-0 in the 
first round of the College Hockey 
Association playoffs. Before the 
players left, The Tartan sat down 
with senior captain and center 
Dan Gilmour to talk about his 
performances and the teams 
season.
Tartan: When did you first 
start playing hockey?
Gilmour: I started teaching 
myself street and roller hockey 
when I was really young, and 
then when I was about eight I 
started playing on open ice. I 
didnt get too competitive until 
middle school; I started playing 
on my high schools team when I 
was in eighth grade.
T: How well has the teams 
season gone, and what kind of 
outcome are you hoping for in 
the playoffs?
G: We have a really solid group 
of guys, but we honestly know 
that several of the teams that 
will be there are a lot better than 
us. Were just hoping to play well 
and maybe get a couple of upsets 
in the first two rounds.
T: Ice hockey is a club sport.
What are some of the biggest dif
ferences between your team and 
a varsity team?
G: Well, for one thing, we, 
the players, run the team, which 
is kind of a time commitment, 
I was president my sophomore 
and junior year, so it does take 
time, but that aspect of it is great. 
For example, we schedule all of 
our own games and practices, 
so we can steer around having 
athletic conflicts around exams 
and spring and fall break.
Also, our coaches are strictly 
volunteers. Our head coach has 
been here for, I think, 16 years, 
and we have two other alumni 
that act as assistant coaches. 
Overall, were very independent 
as a team.
T: How much of an overall 
time commitment do you have 
to the team?
G: We usually have one onice practice. We dont have a 
rink nearby, so we travel about 
a half-hour to practice, and then 
two games per week. It isnt too 
much, but our games are usually 
weekend games, and we have 
to travel a lot, so losing every 
weekend between September 
and March can get frustrating.
T: Do you have anyplace in 
particular you like to travel to 
with the team?
G: Not really. We do travel a 
lot, but not far. Usually like Erie, 
Buffalo, Akron, Cleveland  no
where pretty or fun.
T: Are there any accomplish
ments you are particularly proud 
of?
G: Well I have been a threeyear captain here, and I got to 
play in the College Hockey AllStar East game, which was great. 
When I was younger I got to play 
on the ice at the Johnstown War 
Memorial; its just a really his
toric rink and amazing place to 
get to play.
T: Do you have a most memo
rable game?
G: Not really. Our game last 
weekend with Bucknell was re
ally nice, though. We lost, but 
both my parents got to come, 
and a lot of people came out 
to see the game. Plus we had 
really good ice time. A lot of 
times we play later at night, and 
when youre younger you get up 
at around three in the morning 
sometimes just to get ice time. It 
was just exciting.

With the exception of the Frater
nity Quadrangle, Morewood is 
the closest on-campus living on 
the other side of Forbes.
Morewood is on the same cor
ner as the Forbes and Morewood 
bus stop, and just up the street 
from the Fifth and Morewood 
bus stop.
If'you want to walk to Craig 
Street or Shadyside, youre al
ready an entire campus-length 
closer than you would be if you 
lived in West Wing, Resnik, Donner, or any of the houses on the 
Hill.
Morewood offers singles, 
doubles, and triples, some with 
their own bathroom, and others 
grouped suite-style. This means 
that, unlike a West Wing suite, 
where rooms have common ar
eas, multiple rooms share one 
bathroom (Housings labeling 
system is a little flawed on this 
distinction).
If your room draw number al
lows you the opportunity, and 
you are choosing a room in a 
suite, its generally best to avoid a 
suite with two rooms connected 
only by a bathroom. Its not un
common to wind' up locked out 
of the bathroom connecting the 
two rooms, as someone locks 
both doors when they go in but 
only unlocks the door to their 
own room when leaving.
Furthermore, CPS must walk 
through your room to get to the 
bathroom if you are'in said situ
ation  less than ideal when 
youre in your underwear, sleep
ing, at 9 a.m. As a result, those
bathrooms often remain less 
clean and less stocked with toilet 
paper than those that can be ac
cessed through a common area.
Most room options are sizable 
and accommodating, but then 
theres the occasional L-shaped 
room or bowling-lane room 
(long and narrow). These rooms 
are okay, but dont choose one if 
you have other options  it will 
be cramped and awkward.
The worst parts about More
wood include the tower nearest 
New House, which can add a de
ceivingly large amount of time 
to your walk to campus; smell
ing The Underground if you live 
in rooms facing Morewood E 
Tower; and being witness to any 
and all noise from the parking 
lot if you live in the rooms facing 
west.
The best features of Morewood 
include its proximity to every
thing, the number of people who 
live there, the size of (most of) 
the rooms, access to food With
out having to go outside, and the 
generally relaxed atmosphere.

productions at Purnell or to iceskate at Schenley Park. Even the 
main maintenance guy, Kirk, is 
a familiar- and pleasant face that 
residents recognize as a part of 
the Mudge community.
In fact, the close community 
of Mudge could almost be in
terpreted as a drawback. Your 
friends living in the distant land 
of Morewood Gardens might 
start to wonder where you are.
Beyond being a small, close 
community, Mudge has decently 
sized dorm rooms and a gener
ally clean appearance in the hall
ways and common spaces. But a 
word to the wise on dorm sizes: 
There are one or two dorms in 
each floor of C and B Towers that 
are cut off by the sta 
and thus smaller  you 
should check the
floor plans at Room Draw before 
making your final choice.
Another small drawback of 
Mudge is the weather: Not only 
do you have to hike a long way to 
campus in the freezing cold, but 
the temperature in B and C Tow
ers is not regulated well and can 
get quite chilly.
Though the courtyard is a 
huge boon to Mudge life, the 
large trees can block out a lot 
of sunlight during early fall and 
spring (neither of which last long 
in Pittsburgh).
Though the walk to Mudge is a 
little farther and you risk being 
habitually late due to the More
wood traffic light, it is more 
than worth it to live in a place 
with tons of features that 
most dorm-dwellers only 
dream about.
vending machines and a pool 
table (vending machines are 
also found in A Tower first floor 
and basement). At the top of the 
winding staircase to A Towers 
second floor, there is a small li
brary (one with books). A green 
courtyard space for Mudge resi
dents only with stone benches, a 
small patio, and yes, even a pond 
(sorry, no ice-skating, they drain 
the water in the winter time).
Arguably the most amenitypacked dorm space on campus, 
Mudge is a great place to live. 
And from the beautiful green 
area just for students to the lovely 
architecture of A Tower, it is also 
aesthetically pleasing.
People who come to Mudge 
typically stay in Mudge, so its no 
surprise that almost every firstyear in Mudge chooses to retain 
(usually stealing all the rooms 
on the second floors of B and C 
Towers).
The atmosphere in Mudge is 
very close-knit because of 
the multiple shared spaces 
that students may ac
cess. There are other 
reasons why Mudge 
residents are tight: 
multiple commu
nity events held 
throughout the 
year. Not only do 
Mudge residents 
get the chance to

piano lounge 
during special 
occasions like

Boss: One tight group of guys
by Luke Krzyzanowski
Staffwriter
Location: Margaret Morrison 
Street on the Hill.
Distance: Less than a fiveminute walk from Forbes.
Style of housing: Dorm with 
prime singles and prime dou
bles.
Size: 72 students.
Male/female breakdown: 100
percent male.
Building retention: Yes.
Kitchens: Yes; one on the ground 
floor.
Lounges: Yes; one lounge on 
each floor.
Other amenities: A television 
lounge, full-size billiard table, 
ping-pong table, vending ma
chines, and study area on the 
ground floor.
Located on the Hill, Boss 
House is an all-male dormitory 
that boasted 39 percent of its
residents as first-year students 
during the 2006-2007 school 
year. Boss residents can take sol
ace in the fact that the residence 
hall shares a courtyard with Mc
Gill, the all-female dormitory. 
The green space has picnic tables 
and enough grass to lay down 
on when its sunny. The area is 
used for the Boss/McGill BBQs 
put on by Housing and Dining 
Services.
The ground floor of Boss House 
contains no dorm rooms, but has 
all of the dorms amenities. The 
laundry facilities and a kitchen 
area provide the essentials for 
dorm living. For those not inter
ested in cooking, the trucks and 
the new Carnegie Mellon Caf 
are a few steps away, and for the 
health-conscious, Boss is just a 
short warm-up jog from Skibo 
Gym.
Snacks and sodas for midnight 
sugar-boosts are available from 
vending machines. The wallmounted television and couches 
make for a great way to relax.
Moving in is easier than other 
places because the back door 
(facing Hamerschlag House) 
is usually left open for the pe
riod. Unloading should be done 
quickly, as the street behind Boss 
serves multiple dormitories on
the Hill, but there are no eleva
tors, so be sure to lift with your 
legs.
Rooms, both prime singles 
and prime doubles, in Boss suffer 
from having no built-in closets. 
Housing Services has furnished 
sizable free-standing wardrobes 
instead. Lofted beds with desks 
underneath are available but 
not recommended for singles, 
as they dominate the room and 
make it seem smaller.
The most desirable rooms are 
those ending with the numbers 
03 and 12 on each floor. Their 
layout is somewhat L-shaped, 
which allows for more space and 
better furniture arrangement.
Bathrooms are shared among 
five people, in two doubles and a 
single. Proper etiquette (knock
ing) is required, as in some cases 
there are two doors into the 
bathroom.
Each of the halls three living 
floors has a lounge. Although the 
only university-supplied furnish
ings are couches, the residents of 
an enterprising floor can bring 
their televisions and game con
soles to the lounge and create 
a gamers paradise. Be careful 
about tripping the circuit break
ers if too much power is used at 
one time.
in front of the TV. In addition, 
each floor has its small lounge 
in the center of the floor, from 
which you can gaze longingly at 
Boss through the large window.
The closest exercise facilities 
can be found upstairs from the 
Carnegie Caf in Resnik. However if you live on the third 
floor, going up and down the 
stairs to do six loads of laundry 
is enough exercise. McGill is in a 
great location if youre in a soror
ity, but dont want to live in the 
house, and if you play IM sports, 
or frequent the Tartan Football 
games.
In addition, plan to get rid of 
your meal plan, or at least use 
less of it while in McGill; the 
trucks prove to be a great alter
native to boring, often greasy 
campus food. When choosing 
McGill, dont think about the 
fact that its all girls; think about 
the friendly atmosphere. And if 
you do get tired of all that estro
gen, its simply a hop, skip, and a 
jump over to Boss, Hamerschlag, 
or Scobell. Those Chatham girls 
would probably kill to live there.

In Welch, students live by a 24-hour quiet policy, which can be an asset for students who prefer to study in silence rather than among noisy neighbors.
Henderson and Welch: Quiet and substance-free
Exercise facilities are available in Henderson House which makes for 
another addition to the wellness atmosphere. Work those abs!

News Editor
Henderson and Welch houses 
are part of Carnegie Mellons 
wellness and quiet living commu
nities. Henderson House enforces 
a substance-free policy, while 
Welch House abides by a 24-hour 
quiet hours rule. Students must 
sign a wellness contract once 
deciding to live in Henderson, in 
which they pledge to uphold the 
buildings standards. Both build
ings are located at the top of the 
hill next to Margaret Morrison 
apartments.
In either of these buildings, 
youre committing to the consid
erations of that building, and you 
sign a contract, said Lisa Dippold, manager of assignments for 
Housing Services. If you want to 
move there because you like the 
physical space, thats not really 
enough.
Place Name: Henderson House.
Location: Near Scobell and Hamerschlag on the Hill.
Distance: About a five-minute 
walk to campus.
Style of housing: Dorm  prime 
singles and prime doubles (prime 
indicates that bathrooms are 
shared between two or three 
dorms which typically share a 
common door).
Size: 60 students.
Male/female breakdown: 60
percent male, 40 percent female.
Building retention: Cannot re
tain on the first floor except for 
singles; can retain all rooms on 
the second and third floors.
Kitchens: Yes; One on the lower 
level.
Lounges: TV lounge, game
room.
Other amenities: Fitness center, 
dining areas, air conditioning, 
laundry area.
All Henderson residents, by 
signing the wellness contract, 
pledge to establish a wellnessfocused community environ
ment in Henderson House, take 
advantage of health education 
initiatives and peer support op
portunities provided in Hen
derson House and elsewhere on
campus, participate in at least 
two health education opportuni
ties per semester sponsored in 
Henderson House by students or 
staff, [and] maintain a substance 
free (no alcohol, tobacco, or other 
drugs) environment in Henderson 
House for themselves and their 
guests, according to the Carn
egie Mellon Housing website.
If youre thinking about living 
in Henderson, be sure that youre 
commiting to the houses poli
cies. The no-alcohol policy, in 
particular, has a large impact on 
the community, and can cause 
riffs between students. I wanted 
to live there because I dont 
drink, said junior English major 
Quetzal Quintana. This is Quin
tanas third year as a Henderson 
resident.
Sophomore civil and environ
mental engineering major Andy 
Stocchetti had a different take. 
Stocchetti lived in Henderson 
last year.
A lot of other kids looked 
down on me when they found out 
that I drank, he said. The stu
dents were very substance-free, 
but enforcement wasnt very 
strong. [The policy] was run a bit 
more by students than by RAs.
Because of its small size, 
Henderson places a particular
emphasis on creating a sense of 
community among residents. 
Whether or not the intentions 
have succeeded is up for debate.
Generally, theres a group of 
people who live there every year, 
Quintana said.
He said that the RAs frequently 
organize events for the commu
nity, such as a student/faculty 
dinner and the recent global 
banquet. Both Quintana and 
Stocchetti said that the building 
was quiet and clean.
Quintana emphasized Hen
dersons sense of community, 
pointing to a subset of residents 
who hes lived with for several 
years and the activities that RAs 
frequently organize, such as the 
student/faculty dinner and re
cent global banquet.
Stocchetti was initially drawn 
to Henderson because he figured 
that its small size and the fact 
that there were students of mixed 
years would make it easy to be
come part of a community and re
ceive advice from upperclassmen. 
However, he reported, no one 
ever left their door open, and 
when I did, no one came by to 
say hi. [The other students] were 
very sheltered from the real world 
and the college experience, not 
just in terms of alcohol use.
Place Name: Welch House.
Location: Sits behind Boss and 
McGill on the Hill.
Distance: A five-minute walk to 
campus.
Style of housing: Dorm  prime 
singles and prime doubles (a 
bathroom is shared between two 
or three rooms).
Size: 56 students.
Male/female breakdown: 50
percent male, 50 percent female.
Building retention: Cannot re
tain on the first floor except for 
singles; can retain all rooms on 
the second and third floors.
Kitchens: Yes; One on the lower 
level.
Lounges: Building has study 
lounge, TV room, and rec room.
Other Amenities: Laundry room.
Welch is another Hill house, 
but it distinguishes itself by hav
ing a 24-hour quiet rule.
I fell in love with the quietness 
of the Welch mansion due to the 
spacious bathrooms, the setup of 
the rooms in the way in which a 
suite has a separation by a door 
and the modern look, said Alif 
Sajan, a junior information sys
tems major who lived there last 
semester.
Sajan acknowleged that the 
buildings 24-hour quiet rule 
tends to attract students who like 
to keep to themselves.
Most people are quiet and do 
not look at each other as they are 
1 passing, Sajan said. Its kind 
of like everyone takes the quiet 
house to heart and they do not 
really speak to each other.
He emphasized that Welch can 
be the right environment for the 
right kind of student.
If you are looking for a com
fortable place and you do not 
want to be distracted by noise, 
then Welch is a good choice, Sa
jan said.
All-male dorm Scobell battles a few flaws but has a close community
by Andrew Peters
Personnel Manager
Location: Walking away from 
campus on Margaret Morrison 
Street, Scobell is the first house 
on the Hill.
Distance: Scobell is about a fiveminute walk from the center of 
campus.
Style of housing: Dorm  prime 
singles and prime doubles 
(meaning the bathroom is shared 
among fewer than five students; 
One bathroom usually serves a 
pair of double rooms or a double 
and a single).
Size: 86 students.
Male/female breakdown: 100
percent male.
Building retention: Yes.
Kitchens: Yes; one large kitchen.
Lounges: Yes; one main lounge 
and three smaller study lounges.
Other amenities: Scobell has 
in-house laundry, vending ma
chines, and a pool table.
Scobell is one the oldest dorms 
on campus, built in 1918 and 
named in honor of a Carnegie 
Tech graduate who died in World 
War I.
Carnegie Mellons centennial 
history book notes that Scobell 
was put up as quickly and cheaply 
as possible to house returning 
war veterans, though a recent 
renovation improved the quality 
of the rooms.
Scobell is one of three all-male 
dorms on campus, and while it 
gets messy often, CPS cleans the 
entire building regularly. The 
kitchen is not cluttered and the 
laundry room is free from piles 
of everyones clothes, but the 
hallways are frequently cluttered 
with stray articles of clothing.
Being older and smaller than 
many of the other residences on 
campus, Scobell has some draw
backs. There is only one main 
lounge and one kitchen for the 
entire building, and while they 
are fairly clean, they are not large 
and they are located in the corner 
of the basement. Both, however, 
are fairly new and well-equipped 
with a large television, pool 
table, new sofas, and vending 
machines. There are smaller 
study lounges on each floor, but 
the sofas are pretty old and there 
seems to be a deficit of available
,4
chairs.
In addition, there is no front 
desk in Scobell, so if you dont 
live in Scobell or if you forgot 
your ID, there is no one readily 
on hand to help you get inside the 
building. While this is not usually 
a problem, its not convenient if 
you have friends who like to stop 
by your room.
The hallways are narrow and 
dark, but the rooms are not the 
smallest rooms on campus. They 
are larger than the rooms in New 
House and comparable to some of 
the smaller doubles in Morewood 
Gardens.
The shower sitatuation is not 
bad; though showers are com
munal, there are four showers 
available on each floor, which 
creates a fairly normal residentto-shower ratio.
Scobell resident and first-year 
chemistry major Dami Phillips 
said most Scobell residents arent 
concerned with keeping the 
dorm clean, but that small size 
of the residence hall contributes 
greatly to the sense of commu
nity between the guys.
There are people that are con
tent in Scobell, but there are not 
many people that really like it, 
Phillips said, referring specifi
cally to the residence hall itself, 
not the residents.

Scobell is a historic dorm, built in 1918 to honor a graduate of Carnegie Tech who died in World War I.

One of the few locations on 
campus that offers apartment 
living, Woodlawn is a very small 
building outside of the heart 
of campus. Not far from the Hill, 
Woodlawn is closest to Roselawn 
Houses and Doherty Apartments. 
Though it has few amenities,-the 
accomodations are quite nice for 
on-campus apartment living.
Jonathan Hersh, a current 
resident, said of the rooms, Its 
been argued that these are the 
nicest rooms on campus.
Two of Hershs roommates 
moved out after the first semes
ter, both to pursue jobs. Housing 
didnt give us any new people, 
said Hersh.
Hersh, who entered the ac
celerated masters program for 
information systems this year, 
said that the bedroom sizes are 
somewhat small, but that there 
is still enough space for the four 
people who used to live in his 
two-bedroom apartment. One of 
the interesting accommodation 
styles in Woodlawn is the two 
seven-person apartments that 
actually have two bathrooms and 
two kitchens. These behemoth 
rooms are unique in campus 
housing, but Hersh noted that
the second kitchen is probably a 
big waste of space, I dont think 
they ever use it, he said.
Though Hersh and his room
mate have gotten a little lonelier, 
both profess that the social atmo
sphere is good. Hersh said that 
the RA in Woodlawn will some
times hold small get-togethers 
in her room because the apart
ment building has no lounge. 
The social atmosphere is pretty 
awesome, said Jeremy Weagley, 
a senior in ECE and psychol
ogy and Hershs roommate. 
Woodlawn is also a part of the 
Intersection, a group that in
cludes Doherty Apartments, 
Margaret Morrison, West Wing 
and Resnik. These residences 
share a single CA and often have 
events as a big group.
Woodlawn has its downsides,
though. The buildings declining 
condition and lack of common 
space might be a deal-breaker. 
Hersh said that when his 
roommates and he decided to 
put their desks in the living 
room, they ran into problems 
with too few outlets and blown 
circuits. The worst part is prob
ably the age of the building, 
Weagley said. The heat is really 
crappy, the paint is kinda nasty,, 
and the windows arent very well 
sealed.
But both roommates agreed 
that the spacious rooms and nice 
social atmosphere make up for 
some of the buildings problems. 
Hersh explained that there is 
only one hallway, so you always 
see people you 'know there, as 
well as in the small laundry 
room.

Editor
each Roselawn house has one 
washer and one dryer. However, 
if you need more washers and 
dryers, just a short walk away 
on the Maggie Morrison Street 
level is a larger laundry room. 
Unfortunately this means going 
outside to do laundry, which can 
be somewhat troublesome in the 
colder months.
Your best bet for exercising 
would probably be to run up the 
hill as Forbes winds its way to 
Squirrel Hill, but the new Resnik 
workout rooms above the Carn
egie Caf are just as good. Or, if 
you consider the hill up to the 
houses enough exercise, youre 
all set.
Roselawn houses are in a great 
location if you are in a sorority, 
play a sport, or like to sneak a 
peak when various groups are 
doing Buggy rolls and drops. As 
far as classes go, like much of the 
Hill living, Roselawn is closest to 
Posner Hall and Maggie Mo.
So how do you get in? Get a 
group of friends together and 
try to apply to live in a Roselawn 
house. Unfortunately, a lot of the 
Roselawn houses are inhabited 
by teams and organizations, and 
they arent usually given up read

From the exterior, the stern, 
red-brick architecture of the 
Margaret Morrison Apart
ments may seem grim, but in
side, the apartments are cozy 
without being cramped. Or
ganized with an upstairs and 
downstairs, the apartments 
offer more opportunity for 
privacy, as well as a more dy
namic living space.
Tucked away from the street, 
the apartments nevertheless 
have the convenience of prox
imity to campus and Squirrel 
Hill. The apartments are also 
close to Spirit House and The 
Frame gallery.
The Margaret Morrison food 
trucks sell a variety of ethnic 
foods, just a few steps out the 
door. The Carnegie Mellon Cafe, 
an excellent study and snack 
venue, is handily close by. A bus 
stop where one can catch buses 
to the Waterfront and Squirrel 
Hill is another very short walk 
away on Forbes Avenue.
In terms of living area, the 
apartment-style housing is room
ier and offers greater opportu
nity for individualizing your 
living space. The courtyard of 
the Margaret Morrison complex 
offers benches to sit and relax in 
the sun or host social gatherings. 
The individual apartments are 
well looked-after, and the com
mon areas kept clean.
Occasionally, the laundro
mat floods, but this problem has 
been swiftly corrected in the 
past. The icy stairs can be tricky 
to navigate in the winter but are 
always salted.
The sororities and the frater
nity Sig Tau share the complex 
with the individual residents of 
the apartments but the groups 
are generally peaceful and fun 
neighbors (the only exception to 
this is during Rush, but even then 
the activities and chaos keep to a 
mellow level and Rush partici
pants are usually friendly).
For the 2006-2007 school 
year, the Resident Advisor for 
the apartments frequently or
ganized outings, social nights, 
and other community activi
ties for interested residents. So, 
although residents desires for 
privacy is respected, you can so
cialize as well.
The social atmosphere 
matches the privacy of the apart
ments; most of the residents lead 
active social lives  within their 
own apartments walls. If youre 
not a party person, dont worry 
 its very easy to maintain a 
more solitary lifestyle in Marga

Lounges: 4, West Wing floors 3

Other amenities: There are two 
dining halls: Taste of India and 
the Carnegie Mellon Caf below 
Resnik. There is a workout facil
ity located above the Carnegie
Caf that is accessible through 
the cafe, and a computer cluster 
on the first floor of West Wing. 
Also on the first floor of West 
Wing is a reservable TV lounge 
and a public game room will a 
billiard table and a ping-pong 
table. Laundry and storage are 
downstairs in both buildings.
Many students long to live in 
West Wing or Resnik. And can 
you blame them? Absolutely 
not. These two buildings offer a 
wealth of amenities and diverse 
living environments that would 
satisfy any students wants and 
needs.
One of the greatest advantages 
students receive when living in 
West Wing and Resnik is air con
ditioning. When the fall semester 
begins and its 90 degrees in your 
room, youre going to be hop
ing for air conditioning and un
fortunately West Wing, Resnik, 
New House, and Henderson are 
the only dormitories on campus 
that have it. Another benefit of 
West Wing and Resnik is its new 
workout facilities that overlook 
the Carnegie Caf. Twenty cardio machines, two big screen 
televisions, and exercise mats 
are available till midnight every 
day of the week. This resource is
highly underused by current res
idents but is slowly becoming a 
convenient workout spot for Boss 
and McGill residents, too.
West Wing and Resnik also 
offer a unique type of housing: 
suite-style living. Suites vary in 
size and can accomodate any
where from one to eight resi
dents. A typical suite will house 
five residents with two doubles, 
one single, one large bathroom, 
and one furnished lounge space. 
Generally, suites have large win
dows, and are clean and spa
cious.
In addition to housing 150 
residents, Resnik also houses 16 
special interest students. Special 
interest housing exists to give a 
group a students the chance to 
live together and make an im
pact on the community through 
events, programming, and role 
modeling. This past year Al
pha Kappa Psi held both circle 
suites and benefited the Resnik 
community by planning several 
professional workshops and a 
cultural brunch.
Next year, Alpha Kappa Psi 
will return to Resnik in only one 
circle suite and another special 
interest group will move into the 
other.
This past year, the RAs have 
been active in engaging the resi
dents and in creating a lively 
community within the building. 
Though students have been ac
tive, attendance can vary greatly 
based on when select events are 
planned. Well-attended pro
grams include a weekly, everchanging event called the 10 Spot 
and monthly cultural brunches. 
In past years, West Wing and 
Resnik have had one community 
advisor. Next year, West Wing 
and Resnik will split apart, and a 
community advisor will be hired 
for each building, however the 
houses will still share a housefellow.
In past years, fire alarms and 
robberies have plagued West 
Wing and Resnik. But this year 
fire alarms have gone off very 
few times and there has yet to 
be a robbery caused by unlocked 
doors. Though the fire alarm 
rate was high when the Carnegie 
Mellon Caf was new, it has since 
tapered off.
Common complaints among 
residents include the marching 
band. Every Saturday, residents 
are awoken by the marching 
band practicing on the stadium 
field.
Not to be confused with 
Doherty Hall, Doherty Apart
ments is a great choice for oncampus apartment-style living. 
Located on the hill across Forbes 
Avenue from the East Campus 
parking garage, Doherty features 
four towers (A through D), three 
floors, and a basement level. The 
location is really good if you play 
organized sports or visit Beeler 
a lot. Winter months prove to be 
treacherous, as the long, steep 
driveway along Forbes and the 
side stairs on Beeler tend to get 
icy.
Most of the accomodations are 
either two-person efficiencies or 
three-person apartments. The 
efficiencies are basically a sin
gle room containing two beds, 
two desks, a kitchenette, and 
a small living space; the only sep
arated room is the bathroom. This 
is a good choice if you and your 
roommate dontneedalotofspace 
and dont cook particularly aro
matic foods.
The three-person 
apartments feature a 
living room with a small
loveseat, three chairs and desks, 
small dining table, and kitchen
ette in one room; a separate bed
room; and a separate bathroom. 
The bedroom is pretty small, but 
it helps that you dont have to 
worry about fitting three desks, 
dressers, and cabinets in there 
with the beds; you can place 
them in the living room instead. 
There is one five-person apart
ment in the basement of Doherty 
D Tower that is usually reserved 
for special-interest housing.
In the upcoming year, the 
entire Doherty A Tower will be
come special-interest art hous
ing, in which the university will 
try to localize fine arts majors.
The apartments on the top 
floors tend to be slightly larger 
than the entry level apartments.
The basements of Doherty 
Apartments house one of many 
campus storage locations. 
You can store stuff for fall, 
spring, or summer. The area 
also features a TV lounge with

Cathedral Mansions or CatMan is a good distance away 
from campus. About a 10-min
ute walk from campus, most of 
the apartments in CatMan offer 
a spacious living area. The offcampus apartments also offer 
social diversity, as students from 
the University of Pittsburgh and 
Duquesne University populate 
the hallways  not to mention 
various Pittsburgh natives and 
the like.
The social atmosphere doesnt 
promote togetherness, but most 
CMU students living there be
come fast friends, getting along 
quite nicely. And since it isnt 
technically a dorm (although 
there are resident assistants), 
CatMan keeps the party going.
When residents arent party
ing, the apartments are fairly 
quiet, which is useful for an 
effective study environment.
If youre not much of a walker, 
Escort Services can take you to 
campus and back.
And, instead of toting your 
packages from the UC to Ells
worth Avenue, you can have your 
mail and packages sent directly to 
your address at the apartments.
From the personnel
maintaining the desk to the 
creaky elevators, Cathedral
Mansions is old school.
In fact, one of the elevators 
has been under maintenance 
for the past few months  and 
it still isnt fixed. The other 
functioning elevator at times 
stops on the second-and-a-half 
floor, temporarily stranding
its passengers. There are, of 
course, stairwells to eliminate 
that hazard, but then it will take 
you twice as long to drag up stuff 
from the store.
Cathedral Mansions is vintage, 
but offers updated - and clean
 stoves and refrigerators. And 
they work too! Burners for the 
stove are usually replaced yearly 
or upon notification of damage.
As with the on-campus dorms, 
notifying Housing about damages 
or hazards may fix any stove or re
frigerator problems. In contrast, 
some on-campus apartments 
dont meet the same standards 
with kitchen appliances.
CatMan isnt for the faint or 
weak of heart. A few residents 
have attested to spotting cock
roaches scuttling about. Of 
course, many' buildings experi
ence such insect infestations; the 
problem can easily be remedied 
with a few cans of Raid spray, ex
tra strength.
The bathrooms are a bit more 
(of an adventure. Ceilings my 
collapse, and tiles may fall. But 
the faucets have a surplus of hot 
water  a fine advantage.
The walls are thin, so its easy 
to eavesdrop, which could be a 
good or a bad thing. Furthermore, 
residents can hear any fire alarm 
quickly, and immediatelywhich 
is a valuable safety feature.
Clearly, Cathedral Mansions 
has downsides, but some advan
tages too. After all, it is spacious.

Shirley Apartments is located just down the street from Webster Hall.

Shirley. Veronica. Theyre not 
just names, theyre apartment 
buildings  part of Carnegie 
Mellons Small Oakland Houses 
(SOH). Also including Shady 
Oak and London Terrace 
Apartments, SOH offers a middle 
ground between on- and offcampus housing. Though the 
four buildings each feature 
apartment-style living, they are 
restricted to Carnegie Mellon 
students. SOH offers the same 
close-knit environment youd 
expect to find in Donner, but 
with the added space and 
independence that comes with 
living in Oakland.
You share the same lounge 
and laundry room  and its all 
contained, said Thomas Witholt, 
the SOH housefellow. In SOH, 
Witholt explained, the sense of 
community surpasses the bound
aries typical of on-campus hous
ing, such as floors and wings. 
Youre not just Morewood 3, he 
said. Youre Shirley.
Probably the best example 
of a thriving SOH student 
community is the London 
Terrace Apartments. Actually a 
pair of twin buildings  London 
and Terrace  the two hosted 
more first-year students than 
ever this year. Fueled by last
falls housing crunch, Carnegie 
Mellon converted Terrace to 
undergraduate housing; in past 
years, the building was exclusive 
to grad students.
We werent entirely sure how 
it was going to work out, Witholt 
said, but the arrangement turned 
out successful. Mostly first-years, 
the residents of London and Ter
race were able to gel, resulting 
in what Witholt called an en
vironment similar to a small 
New House. Besides opening 
Terrace, Housing altered its key 
system so that all the entrance 
keys for London also worked for 
Terrace, and vice versa. Still, 
Witholt said, there hasnt been 
much socializing between the 
two buildings despite the strong 
community vibe.
Such intimacy is not exclusive 
to London and Terrace; despite 
being off campus, SOH RAs 
maintain a hands-on philoso
phy. Theres a pretty good num
ber of activities, actually, said 
Shady Oak resident Jeff Meek, a 
sophomore majoring in biology. 
According to Meek, Shady Oak 
typically has at least one com
munity activity per week.
Another source of together
ness are the lounges. Each build
ing in the SOH is equipped with 
a lounge, many of which come 
with foosball and pool tables. 
Most impressive is that of Shady 
Oak, recently renovated to in
clude ample seating space, a 
kitchen, and exercise equipment. 
Responding to student sugges
tions, the owners of Shady Oak 
Apartments agreed to a base
ment makeover.
Though Carnegie Mellonleases 
Shady Oak, London Terrace, and 
Veronica, the situation with Shir
ley Apartments is unique. Shir
ley is different because we own 
that building, Steve Gergely, the 
Housing facility coordinator for 
SOH. Unlike those living in other 
SOH buildings, Shirley residents 
are privy to the universitys own 
FMS (Facilities Management Ser
vices) staff, which gives Housing 
more authority in the fulfillment 
of maintenance requests.
Since it is owned by Carnegie 
Mellon, Shirley is the SOH build
ing most ready to respond to 
student wishes. Shady Oak and 
London Terrace, for example, 
have little incentive to switch to 
the eSuds system, Witholt ex
plained, because such a change 
wouldnt do them any good if 
Carnegie Mellon decided to can
cel its lease.
The new courtyard in Shirley, 
for instance, is another way that 
Housing responded to the prefer
ences of students.
In spite of the positive aspects 
of living in SOH locations, safety 
is one concern that deters many 
students. London and Terrace 
has not had a good year this year,
Witholt said. The buildings suf
fered break-ins last spring break 
and over the summer, but Hous
ing responded to each threat 
with an upgrade in security.
Housing recently added dead
bolts to doors in London and Ter
race, and the windows on the first 
floor are equipped with bars. In 
addition, the university ordered 
custom meshes for the London 
Terrace windows, which should 
be arriving in the near future. In 
Shady Oak, too, safety is also a 
factor Housing is looking to im
prove; after an intruder entered 
the basement through an open 
window, Housing added locks 
so that each window now opens 
only halfway. According to With
olt, there are also plans to add the 
emergency Blue Lights through
out the parts of Oakland where 
most students walk to class.
Though the distance from 
campus can lead to issues in safety, 
it also affords SOH residents with 
some excellent opportunities. I 
think Craig Street is amazing, 
Witholt said, referring to the 
various restaurants and shops 
in close proximity to the SOH 
buildings. SOH students are also 
closer to the restaurants on Forbes 
that offer half-price discounts 
after 11:00 pm in addition to 
all of downtown Pittsburgh. 
Downtown offers a lot, and as 
Witholt put it  Were already 
halfway there.

THE TARTAN  MARCH 5, 2007
Fairfax Apartments is high-class style just steps away from Craig Street
Left: Fairfax is located just across from the Co-op and is an easy walk to Craig Street. Above: Fairfax has a large
Mingwei Tay/Photo staff lobby that adds class and the feeling that youre nowhere near campus housing.
Neville Apartments, or the the Co-op, offers a unique experience
community room in the base
ment.
Other amenities: Cable pro
vided by Comcast, community 
and laundry rooms in basement, 
rooftop lounge and courtyard 
available for residents, exercise 
room for small fee, you can have 
your mail delivered there if you 
want. Management office on the 
first floor is very helpful.
Fairfax is a remodeled turn-ofthe-century apartment building 
located on Fifth Avenue, across 
from St. Pauls Cathedral. Stu
dents who dont mind a short 
walk to campus and who like 
peace and quiet should take a 
look at this mixed-use build
ing. Besides Carnegie Mellon 
students, Fairfax also is home 
to University of Pittsburgh stu
dents, UPMC employees, and 
many senior citizens.
Students have the option 
of living in either efficiency 
apartments (large or small) 
or one-bedroom apartments 
designed for two people. Efficien
cies feature a combined living 
and sleeping area with a small 
but fully furnished kitchen space 
complete with full-sized refrig
erator and gas stove and oven. 
One-bedroom apartments have 
a separate living room and gal
ley kitchen. The apartments vary 
in size, and some of the kitchens 
also have an adjoining dining 
area. CMU Housing provides fur
niture and an Ethernet router, 
and Comcast provides cable tele
vision to CMU students.
The Fairfax provides plenty of 
space and privacy, but if youre 
interested in a close floor com
munity or a lively floor, this is 
probably not the building for you. 
Because it is a mixed-use build
ing, students tend to share floors 
with non-CMU residents and 
do not spend much time in the 
hallways or public areas such as 
the lobby. There is a resident as
sistant for every two floors, and 
the basement community room 
is booked roughly twice a week 
for CMU resident events such as 
game or movie nights; the hall
ways, however, remain almost 
eerily quiet.
One of Fairfaxs greatest ad
vantages is its proximity to Craig 
Street. PNC Bank and Citizens 
Bank are within 100 yards of the 
buildings main doors, and stu
dents just have to cross Henry 
Street at the rear of the building 
to go to Craig Streets restaurants 
and stores.
Parking is a slight problem at 
Fairfax: There is an adjoining 
permit-parking lot at Fifth and 
Neville, but there is no free or 
non-permit parking during the 
day unless you are lucky enough 
to snag a street spot. Students 
tend to park in the PNC Bank 
parking lot after hours. There is 
a loading dock for moving large
items in and out, but be mindful 
on the weekends and on moving 
days, when the driveway and 
back street get very crowded.
Fairfax offers laundry and 
mail services to CMU students as 
well. The laundry room is located 
in the basement and is card
operated. Students can purchase 
a laundry card in the laundry 
room as well. Students have 
the option of having their 
mail forwarded to their 
Fairfax mailbox, although this 
sometimes means a days delay. 
Packages can be sent to Fairfax 
and held in the management 
office, which is open during 
regular business hours. Students 
can also contact building 
maintenance through the main 
office.
Altogether, Fairfax is ideal for 
students looking for a quiet and 
large independent space who 
still want to maintain some ties 
to campus. The building is in 
good repair, and maintenance 
and management is prompt and 
helpful. Students looking for a 
closer floor community might 
be disappointed, however; that 
makes Fairfax a better choice for 
older or upperclass students.
munity; it has no resident as
sistant or housefellow, only a li
aison to the Housing office who 
helps the Co-op solve mainte

In recent years, the spirit of 
social change through activ
ism has died down in the Co-op, 
though it remains a collection of 
opinionated and involved stu
dents who are committed to a 
variety of campus organizations. 
Members are chosen by their 
demonstrated commitment to 
the Co-ops five ideals: environ
mental awareness, democratic 
processes, racial equality, gender 
equality, and equality of sexual

For those concerned with the 
expense of campus housing,

residents must pay to live in the

laundry facilities shut down at 
11 p.m. to prevent disturbing 
residents.)
Webster, a hotel in its heyday, 
is a beautiful building, and visi
tors can feel the history as they 
walk in. The two top floors used
to house a swimming pool, and 
though Webster does not have 
this amenity today, it is still 
amazing to think of where the 
building established its roots.
Today, Webster houses 
students, couples, and senior 
citizens. Though Carnegie 
Mellon has housing available on 
the second through ninth floors, 
the apartments are interspersed 
with apartments housing 
students from- the University of 
Pittsburgh and non-students. 
Since Pitt students rent directly 
from Webster as opposed to 
going through Pitt housing, they 
sometimes have intense parties. 
Fortunately, it is not too loud 
unless you are in the hallways. 
Otherwise, the Pitt students are 
friendly and sometimes become 
your elevator buddies.
Note: If you visit Webster be
fore moving in keep in mind that 
there is different furniture in ev
ery apartment. Dont be misled 
by the rooms current furniture. 
There is no guarantee that you 
will get that particular loveseat. 
Also, slipcovers are advisable!
For the most part, living in Web
ster implies that you will have a 
certain amount of independence. 
Interaction with the community 
is really up to the individual.
The greatest amount of con
tact you need to have with your 
RA is a periodic trip to pick up 
toilet paper, garbage bags, or 
light bulbs (provided free).
However, the Webster staff 
makes available all sorts of
programs throughout the year, 
including Sunday dinners every 
week that are provided by the 
Webster staff.
Currently, the school is work
ing to improve Oakland safety. 
Though shuttle buses do run ev
ery half hour, sometimes people 
would rather walk than Wait 
a few extra minutes. As most 
students have noticed, assaults 
have happened in the WQED 
parking lot this year. Warnings 
have been implemented and that 
area has less traffic than before. 
Carnegie Mellon has made an 
invested effort to work on other 
modes of safe transport late at 
night.
Inside the building, a security 
guard watches the entrance at 
night. He, together with the elec
tronic key system (each student 
has a key fob that, when scanned, 
opens the door to the building), 
make for a safe living commu
nity. There is also a maintenance 
man living in the building. When 
situations such as leaks arise, he 
is easily accessible.
Webster is an excellent living 
area for those who seek some
thing closer to the real world. 
If youre extensively involved on 
campus, it is slightly difficult to 
organize your life around trans
port back and forth, but it is 
manageable.
It is nice to have an apartment 
experience, and Websters prox
imity to Oakland (and half-price 
food) add to a students overall 
Carnegie Mellon experience.

With a charming community full of great architecture and local flavor, Squirrel Hill is a most welcoming place.
Squirrel Hill welcomes you in
by Michelle Bova
Contributing Editor
If youve ever wanted to get 
away from the daily grind of 
Carnegie Mellon and enter a. 
living situation that feels more 
like a home than a place you 
go to do your homework, you 
may consider living off campus. 
And if local color, in your opin
ion, should include people of all 
ages, not just college students 
(read: Oakland) or middle-aged 
yuppies (read: Shadyside) then 
you might want to make a stop 
in Squirrel Hill while looking for 
apartments.
Chances are, youre already 
familiar with Squirrel Hill. The 
area is home to Giant Eagle, 
Barnes & Noble, a swanky li
brary, and Eat n Park. And 
those are just a few of the main 
attractions. S quirrel Hill is decid
edly as colorful as Oakland, but 
has less dirt and a more diverse 
crowd. Its as bustling as Shadyside but lacks the cookie-cutter 
chain establishments. Instead 
of Asian restaurants owned by 
a group called Big Burrito (Shadysides Umi and Soba), Squirrel 
Hill has Bangkok Balcony and 
the New Dumpling House.
Its not that Oakland and Sha
dyside arent great places to live, 
its just that if you like what you 
see in Squirrel Hill  a quieter 
community with a unique flavor 
 then you should check out the 
possibilities of living there.
Rent for different Squirrel Hill 
housing options varies greatly. 
Like many communities near 
college campuses, one street 
closer to a bus route or farther 
from a more dangerous border
ing community can make all the
difference. A good rule of thumb 
is that the closer the place is to 
Forbes and Murray avenues, the 
more expensive it is going to be 
(apartments on Darlington are 
very expensive, for instance) 
and the farther down Murray it 
is, the cheaper it is going to be 
(by the time you get to Forward 
Avenue the rents are drastically 
lower).
Heres what you might expect 
based on a Craigslist search:
one-bedroom: $550-800 
two-bedroom: $750-975 
three-bedroom: $900-2000
Although there are fewer 
apartments to be found in Squir
rel Hill than Shadyside, they are 
generally in better condition 
than their plentiful Shadyside 
counterparts.
Living in Squirrel Hill has 
some big upsides, including close 
proximity to a few bars, many 
restaurants, and a small shopping 
district that, if you live along the 
bus lines, will be within walking 
distance from your home. Also, 
during the summer, Squirrel Hill 
shops have a sidewalk sale.
If the shops are not enough 
to encourage outdoor walking 
during warmer months, the 
architecture of many of the 
houses is beautiful and makes 
walking in Squirrel Hill a joy 
instead of a chore.
The slight downsides of the 
community are that rents are 
still high like other communities 
that neighbor college campuses, 
and the community is probably 
not suited to someone who likes 
a wild nightlife. While Squirrel 
Hill has a few bars and restau
rants open late, a party-happy 
student will probably find the at
mosphere a little sleepy.
Theres something for every
one in Squirrel Hill. If you want 
maximum convenience to cam
pus, youll probably choose to 
live on Wilkins, Wightman, or 
near Murray Avenue between 
Forbes and Hobart. If youd 
rather the shops be a convenient 
distance, any place along Mur
ray or even Shady is a good bet. 
For amazing architecture, the 
farther north you are (think of 
walking up the hill on Murray) 
the better. If safety is a factor, po
lice statistics on crime show that 
the farther south in Squirrel Hill 
you go, the more crime rises, but 
it is worth noting that the entire 
community is very safe and that 
the police department is located 
just north of Forbes and Murray.
Keep in mind that further 
down Wilkins is still right along 
the bus routes that begin in 67 
(such as the 67F or 67A) which 
go directly to campus, so you 
dont have to live on or near Mur
ray to be able to make it to class. 
On nice days you may choose to 
walk  most locations in Squir
rel Hill are a brisk 25-minute 
walk to campus.
Though the Squirrel Hill com
munity is not as college-oriented 
as some of the surrounding com
munities, you may find that to be 
a welcome change.
Overall, Squirrel Hill is a 
charming place that encour
ages walking and watching your 
neighbors (who are usually inter
esting). If youre looking to live 
someplace a little quieter, where 
youre still within walking dis
tance to campus, without having 
to feel like the constant reminder 
that the daily grind is right out
side your window, then Squirrel 
Hill is a good choice for you.
Beautiful houses, a variety of ethnic restaurants, and movie theaters are 
some of the reasons youll be encouraged to walk around in Squirrel Hill.

News Editor
Lets face it: While Carnegie Mellon 
is pretty efficient spending Bill Gates 
money it can give students the run
around wher^' theyre trying to solve 
more logistical quandaries. How many 
times have you gone to the Career Cen
ter or th Info Desk with a question, only 
to be told that the answer can actually 
be found at the Hub... and its closed? In 
addition, ask someone behind a desk any 
question that doesnt hav a textbook 
answer and youll receive the inevitable 
dead end: Its on the website.
To cut out the middleman, heres 
where to go to solve some of CMU stu
dents most common housing problems.
Youre locked out.
If you live in a dorm, go to the Hous
ing and Dining Services Office (located 
in More wood Gardens). Theyll be ableto make you a temporary key to get back 
into your room. If youve misplaced your 
ID altogether, youre going to have to go 
down to the Carnegie Mellon Card Office 
(located in the basement of Warner Hall 
across from the Hub) within 24 hours 
and have a new one made. Bring cash or 
a check: Unless you can prove its been 
damaged, itll cost you $15.
If you live in an off-campus apartment, 
also go to the Housing office. The 
office has an extra key for each offcampus residence that it can lend you 
temporarily, free of charge. If you think 
youve lost your key for good, Housing 
can sell you a new one.
Regardless of where you live (as long 
as its within the housing system), if 
yourelocked out of your residence after 
hours, call University Police at 8-6232. 
Wait by your room or apartment, and 
theyll come unlock the door for you.
You want to change rooms or room
mates.
If you want to change rooms or build
ings, go to the Housing office and ask to 
be placed on the room change waitlist. 
Youll be asked to fill out a form listing 
your alternate housing choices in order 
of priority. You will be contacted in the 
order in which you are placed on the 
waitlist.
You have a better chance' of chang
ing rooms spring semester than you do 
in the fall. For students who are on the 
'housing waitlist for the fall, its about a 
50/50 chance, said Lisa Dippold, man
ager of assignments for Housing and 
Dining Services. In the spring, its basi
cally 100 percent.
If your roommate is moving out and 
you want to pull in a friend (or vice 
versa), its possible just dont plan on 
it. Whether or not its a feasible option 
depends on the time of year and how 
long the housing waitlist is, so be sure 
to let Housing know your preference be
fore the slot is filled.
If you have left the campus housing 
system and wish to get back in, go to 
the Housing office and ask to be placed 
on the housing waitlist. However, once 
youre back into the system, you cant 
hold the spot for next semester while 
still living at your off-campus residence
 you must move back into a campusowned residence that semester in order 
to remain in the system.
Something in your room doesnt work 
correctly and needs to be fixed.
File a maintenance request on the 
Housing website at www.housing.cmu. 
edu.
If you put in a maintenance request 
and havent received a response, either 
file another one or contact your facilities 
coordinator. Facilities coordinators vary 
by residence, so check who yours is at 
www. housing. cmu.edu/Facilities/staff.
You want to speak to your housefellow.
Housefellows for Mudge House, 
Morewood Gardens, and all first-year 
housing areas  New House, Donner, 
Hamerschlag, and Morewood E Tower
 have offices located in the Student 
Development Office on the first floor of 
Morewood Gardens. Students can drop 
in and speak to their housefellow if he 
or she is available. If its a larger matter 
that will require discussion, students 
can stop by the office and schedule an 
appointment at the front desk.
The Student Life Office, located across 
from the Student Development Office, 
can also help connect you with your 
housefellow if youve been unable to 
speak with him or her.
You need storage space.
Students cannot store or retrieve 
items from storage anytime they like, 
according to Alauna Dunphy of the 
Student Development Office. Storage 
space is only available at the beginning 
and end of each semester on a first-come, 
first-serve basis. Ask your RA toward the 
end of the semester if your building has 
storage space for students, and when 
you can expect to be able to store items. 
Although free of charge, generally there 
is a maximum of three small boxes per 
resident. Both incoming and outgoing 
students are allowed to use storage
space in their building, provided such 
space exists.
Your eSuds service doesnt work.
Send an e-mail to housing@ explain
ing the problem. Dont forget to include 
your name, building and room number, 
student ID number, and card number.
Your room draw account doesnt 
work.
If you are unable to log into your room 
draw account, send an e-mail to Housing 
explaining the problem.
If room draw says you dont have a 
number, that doesnt necessarily mean 
youre out of the system  it could be a 
glitch. Every first-year, sophomore, and 
junior student currently in the housing 
system is assigned a room draw number. 
If you are a senior or fifth-year student, 
you may not have received a number 
because Housing assumed you were 
graduating, said Tina Hanlon, manager 
of assignments for Housing and Dining 
Services. Send an e-mail to Housing 
stating that you will be enrolled next 
fall, and theyll assign you a number.
News flash: If you currently live in a 
fraternity, sorority, or the Neville Co-op, 
you do not count as being in the housing 
system and therefore were not assigned 
a room draw number.
Youre going or returning from 
abroad.
Going abroad is the only case in which 
students can be part of the housing 
system without being physically living 
in on-campus housing, Hanlon said. 
If you are abroad while Room Draw is 
taking place, you will still be assigned a 
room draw number and will participate 
in Room Draw online. If you are abroad 
for the fall semester and need to 
register for spring housing, schedule an 
appointment to talk to a member of the 
room assignments staff at rmassign@.
You receive an e-mail that says you 
havent paid your bill.
Relax  youre not going to end up 
homeless. Check in with the Hub, lo
cated on the ground floor of Warner 
Hall. Theyll be able to tell you whether 
or not you still owe money. If you do,
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff
theyll send a bill home.

Questions to ask 
before moving in
by Jess Anders
Staffwriter
Its that time of year for stu
dents around campus: Summer 
is around the corner, and al
ready lottery numbers for next 
years dorms have come out.
Deciding whether to stay 
on campus or venture off can 
be a daunting experience for 
a first-timer. There are a lot of 
questions to consider before 
even looking at an apartment, 
including defining your price 
range, finding roommates, 
and understanding the various 
neighborhoods you may possibly 
want to move into.
Once youve decided to take 
the leap and go off campus, here 
are some questions you should 
ask when browsing apartments.
Safety
 Have you had any break-ins?
 Is the area safe?
 Will anyone else have a copy 
of my key?
 Is the entrance gated or locked, 
and do I need a key or a code to 
enter?
These are the most important 
questions to ask your landlord. 
Look for apartments with gated 
or locked entries. These ensure 
that only tenants will be able to 
get inside. You should also be 
wary if the liandlord shies away 
from questions involving secu
rity and break-ins.
General Policies
 Is it okay to have guests over 
for an extended period of time?
 Am I allowed to paint my 
apartment or make additions to 
it?
 Will I have storage and access 
to storage?
 Is there on-street parking or is 
there assigned parking?
 How accessible is parking on 
the street?
 Are pets allowed?
 Is there a laundry room ac
cessible at all hours or are there 
limits?
Make sure to clarify these 
points with your landlord before 
signing a lease. Some landlords 
charge extra fees for guests and 
pets. Most landlords will allow 
you to paint your apartment as 
long as you repaint it white when 
you move out.
Parking depends on the street
 some streets have permit 
parking only, while others are 
open to park on. Ask your land
lord about parking options.
Costs
 How much is the monthly rent 
and how much is the deposit?
 Is there an application fee and 
a credit check?
 What utilities are covered and 
which must I pay for? Ask about 
gas, electricity, water, hot water, 
sewage, trash removal, phone, 
cable, and internet access.
Cost is something that should 
be discussed up front. It is im
portant to distinguish between 
the deposit and the monthly 
rent  often times your deposit 
is equal to your rent, but some
times its a larger advance. Also, 
know at the start what you will 
be responsible for and what the 
landlord will be responsible for.
Most apartments in Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, and Oakland 
will pay for water, gas, and sew
age while you will be responsible 
for electric and all other ameni
ties. Make sure you discuss this 
with your landlord, and mention 
it once again during the signing 
of your lease.
While this isnt a Comprehen
sive list, it will at least give you 
some guidelines to work with.
Shadyside: Chic shopping and fine living
by Selena Beckman-Harned
Junior Staffwriter
With its gorgeous architec
ture and chic shopping district, 
Shadyside is a desirable place to 
live. The neighborhoods popu
larity stems from Walnut Street, 
the shopping street known for 
upscale fashion, cosmetics, and 
gifts, as well as excellent cuisine. 
Nearby Ellsworth Avenue also 
boasts a variety of shops and res
taurants. Shadyside is also home 
to Shadyside Hospital, Whole 
Foods, and Giant Eagle Market 
District. In the first week in Au
gust, the streets are closed off for 
the Shadyside Arts Festival.
You can find an affordable 
apartment in Shadyside, but 
youll have to do some digging, 
and it definitely wont be one of 
the more posh residences in the 
area. A quick scan on Craigslist 
(pittsb urgh. craigslist. org) re -
vealed the following:
one-bedroom: $500-700 
two-bedroom: $700-900 
three-bedroom: $1000-$1500
Shadyside is among the safest 
neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. If 
youre worried about crime, look' 
for an apartment in the southern 
part of Shadyside  the north 
borders East Liberty, which has 
a much higher crime rate  but 
overall, its safe to walk alone at 
night in Shadyside.
Since Shadyside is home 
to some of the most gigantic 
houses in Pittsburgh, as well as 
a luxury shopping district, the 
atmosphere could be described, 
depending on your viewpoint, 
as either upper-middle class or 
elitist.
Youre much more likely to 
see women in Jimmy Choo high 
heels and Prada on Walnut than 
on Forbes. The houses are all 
spotless  the kind of buildings 
that look quaint and chic because 
their owners purchase special 
furnishings in the quaint and 
chic aisle at Ikea.
Shadyside is a popular neigh
borhood for students despite 
higher rents since the CMU 
shuttle runs along its borders. 
Even without the shuttle, cam
pus is only a 20- to 30-minute 
walk away, and several public 
bus routes also run through 
the neighborhood, including 
the 71 A, 71 C, and the 500, and 
there is also a stop for the East 
Busway, the express bus route 
to downtown. If you have a car, 
take note that everybody else 
likes Walnut Street too  youll 
have to compete for a parking 
spot if your apartment doesnt 
come with one.
Why live here:
 Great shopping, dining, and 
entertainment on Walnut Street 
and Ellsworth Avenues.
 Convenient for grocery shop
ping.
 CMU shuttle runs through the 
neighborhood.
 Within walking distance to 
campus.
Why not to live here:
 Rents are high.
 Parking is more difficult than 
in other neighborhoods.
 Few fellow students: only 14.3 
percent of Shadysides popula
tion is between the ages of 18 
and 24.
Hints
To find an apartment in 
Shadyside, look for listings 
along Negley, Centre, and Fifth 
avenues. Often, listings will 
mention Shadyside by name as 
well. But be careful: that doesnt 
mean the apartment is actually 
in Shadyside.
For the money-conscious, 
there are also several more af
fordable neighborhoods also in 
walking distance to Shadyside, 
including Friendship and Bloom
field. If youre considering Sha
dyside, it would be worthwhile 
to look there too.
Friendship is one of Pitts
burghs tiniest neighborhoods, 
wedged in between Bloomfield, 
Shadyside, Garfield, and East
Liberty. Most of Friendships 
streets are lined with Victorian 
houses converted into apart
ments, and the area is popular 
with graduate students, employ
ees of Shadyside and West Penn 
hospitals, and professors.
A scene in the forthcoming 
Smart People was shot in Friend
ship, and part of Wonder Boys 
was shot in Bloomfield. Friend
ship is extremely convenient 
for all of Shadysides amenities. 
Also, the coffeeshop and vegan 
restaurant The Quiet Storm, at 
the border with Garfield on Penn 
Avenue, is worth a visit.
And Bloomfield is Pittsburghs 
Little Italy, with several 
excellent restaurants  dont 
miss Alexanders Pasta Express, 
where you can split a plate of 
scrumptious pasta and still end 
up with leftovers.
Liberty Avenue is lined with 
interesting boutiques, restau
rants; and coffeeshops, and even 
a couple of dollar stores for those 
of us who cant afford Walnut 
Streets prices. Liberty Avenue is 
also home to several parades dur
ing the year, including Columbus 
Day and Halloween parades, and 
Little Italy Days in September.
Shadyside is fairly pricey, but it offers a nice area for shopping and dining 
and is relatively safe.

The Tartan, as usual, was scattered with random

finally found one that made sense. In one article, a

because you can always catch a cold. And you

Dear Janet,
This year I moved into a suite 
with two friends, and their 
living habits are horrific. They 
leave food rotting in the sink, 
they never take the trash 
out, and nobody ever cleans 
the common rooms. I end 
up doing everything, and its 
gotten to the point where Im 
starting to resent my friends! 
What should I do?
Needs Eager Assistance 
(with) Trash
Dear NEAT,
My vote would be to sit down 
for a house meeting and try to 
agree on certain chores for each 
of you, If that doesnt work, you 
may have to get creative, leaving 
notes for them or even moving the 
entirety of someones mess from 
a common area to their room.
If they're incredibly resistant, you 
might be able to work out a deal 
where you do all the cleaning and, 
in return, they buy all the beer and 
pizza. You get the idea; adapt it 
to your personality and lifestyle. 
Finally, I have to ask  are you 
positive youre not overreacting? 
Aim for the elimination of garbage 
and rotting food first; the rest will 
follow. \ sincerely wish you luck.
Janet

Vintage is back, and style-mongers all over are 
starting to turn their eyes to the fashion eras from 
which their parents hail. While thrift stores are 
readily available throughout Pittsburgh, there's 
no guarantee of finding genuine vintage clothing. 
Thrift stores such as the popular Avalon, which 
recently relocated to Squirrel Hill, feature an 
eclectic mix of clothing from the past several 
decades. Still, the concentration of goods is more 
geared towards the present, consisting mostly of 
alternative styles that are a few years old.
What sets Crimes of Fashion apart from the general 
definition that thrift stores have taken on is its 
loyalty to truly vintage clothing. A five-minute 
walk down Forbes Avenue between campus and 
Craig Street, Crimes of Fashion is the business of 
two partners, Chuck Lipinksi and Tim Stanicz, and 
has been around for 16 years. Both are originally 
from Pittsburgh and take turns working shifts 
throughout the week. The clothing line, Lipinkski 
claimed, was geared toward college students. Our 
clientele is mostly college kids," he said. "Disco 
sells, so it's kind of taken over [the store]. Its what 
[they] buy when they come here on the weekends.
The clothing is mostly purchased from a vintage 
clothing warehouse in the Strip District, which 
only sells to registered dealers.
Lipinski and Stanicz started out selling at flea 
markets before eventually investing in a store.
As for the name, it comes from a suggestion by 
Lipinksis unnamed friend. "He was reading a TV 
guide, and there was an article about bad fashion 
in movies, Lipinski said, and he said, 'Look, 
crimes of fashion!' so we decided [on it].
The apparel styles that can be found at Crimes of 
Fashion are most flattering in the womens section.
Hey Janet,
So theres this girl, and we 
had a thing, but we both know 
were not right for dating 
each other. She still wants to 
keep me around for physical 
comfort, I think because Im 
convenient. Im not interested 
in anyone else, but I know Im 
just in this situation because 
Im really attracted to her. Its 
come to the point where I have 
to battle my own desires every 
weekend. What should I do?
Tempted Over Racy Needs
Dear TORN,
What you should do depends on 
what you want. Something keeps 
you coming back to her, whether 
sexual or emotional, so before you 
act you have to figure out what 
youre shooting for: a physical 
relationship, a friend, or simply 
freedom from your desires?
If it's just the temptation of seeing 
her, youll have to be strong, 
and you might try hanging out 
elsewhere. Meeting new people 
will hopefully help you move on. My 
completely uninformed guess is 
that beyond the sexual attraction, 
you have some unresolved 
feelings for her. If that's the case, 
continuing to sleep with her will 
only make things harder, and 
getting some space is absolutely 
the best thing to do.
Janet
The styles there range from around the 1940s 
and onward, and a plethora of hats, veils, gloves, 
scarves, and clutches grace the front section of the 
store. But the men's selection seems to be much 
more lackluster, consisting mostly of conservative 
pants and tacky shirts.
The concept of real vintage is an appealing and 
charming one, but that seems to be one of the 
few proponents working for Crimes of Fashion.
The lack of popularity that the store seems to 
experience could be attributed to a generally 
unappealing selection to the vintage hunter 
and casual shopper alike. None of the apparel is 
sized, so rummaging is necessary, which can be 
confusing since some of the clothes are labeled 
with neither measurements nor standard size 
equivalents. The service could also be improved; 
the general atmosphere yields the vibe, "Youre not 
welcome unless you're buying something.
The price range varies considerably; while most 
items are generally under $50, those on the 
higher end are priced high enough to cause a 
dent in the pockets of college-going students. 
This seems especially unreasonable given the 
sloppy presentation and unappealing style of the 
clothing available (flimsy patterned shirts for men 
and flamboyant party dresses for women). While 
a few pearls can occasionally be salvaged (usually 
in the form of accessories), the question remains 
of whether the service or the time is worth the 
purchase.

Joffrey Ballet visits Pittsburgh
Company covers tragedy, war, love, and Prince
Courtesy of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust
Images taken from the Joffrey Ballet 
production of The Green Table, an 
anti-war protest first performed by the 
company in 1967. Last weekend, the 
Joffrey Balletperformed The Green Table 
and other works for a packed house at the 
Benedum Center.
A staple of the Joffrey Ballet, The Green Table is an anti-war 
polemic first performed by the company in 1967. Illustrating 
the brutality and corruption of war, the timeless piece can 
easily be applied to current affairs. The opening and closing 
scenes are very instructive of the period leading up to war. 
Gentlemen in black debate and disagree over a green table. 
Their rhetoric yields little and war ensues. A progression of 
several scenes (The Farewells, The Battle, The Refugees,
The Partisan, The Brothel, and The Aftermath) shows the 
debauchery and inhumanity that accompany conflict. Friday's 
performance had Brian McSween in the role of Death, a cross 
between a Roman general and Germanic barbarian. The 
Green Table ends where it began, gentlemen in black are once 
again at the table with nothing resolved. War does not decide 
who is right; war decides who is left.
The program is well balanced, although the pieces are not 
thematically related. Ruth, Ricordi Per Due establishes ballet 
as an art form, a supreme beauty both cold and austere, like 
that of a sculpture. Sometimes It Snows in April shakes off 
the cold with lively energy and upbeat music. The remaining 
two performances illustrate ballets ability to tell involving and 
understandable stories.
The Joffrey Ballet's history goes back to 1956. It began as the 
brainchild of ballet teacher Robert'Joffrey and choreographer 
Gerald Arpino. The company, presently based in Chicago, 
tours the country performing classical and contemporary 
works. The Joffrey Ballet was also the subject of the film The 
Company (2003).
Luke Krzyzanowski | Staffwriter
Fine art takes many forms. Last weekend, that form was 
dance as the Joffrey Ballet performed at the Benedum Center 
for a full house. The show consisted of four separate works 
spanning different styles and time periods: Ruth, Ricordi Per 
Due (created in 2003), Sometimes It Snows in April (from 
Billboards, 1993), Apollo (1928), and The Green Table (1932).
Created by Gerald Arpino, cofounder of the Joffrey Ballet,
Ruth, Ricordi Per Due was written to be a duet between Maia 
Wilkins and Willy Shives. The two gave a nearly flawless 
performance of two lovers dancing together, interrupted 
by tragedy when one of them dies. Ruth, Ricordi Per Due 
served as a very appropriate commencement of the evenings 
performances. The show-was set to the music of Albinoni; 
organ and strings provided a soft backdrop to dance that 
came off as serene, but communicated the incredible strength 
of Wilkins and Shives.
Sometimes It Snows in April has dancers jumping through 
the air with their arms and legs out, crossing in geometric 
patterns to the music of Prince. Taken from Billboards, the first 
ballet set to rock music, Sometimes is a definitively modern 
work. The dynamism and energy of the performance cannot 
be understated; its reminiscent of "Shake a Tail Feather" from 
Blues Brothers, with a kick of contemporary ballet.
Stories are usually told through written or spoken word in 
literature or film, but they are also communicable through 
subtle expressions of dance, with costumes and props. Apollo 
and The Green Table are perfect examples of stories told 
through dance.
Set to Stravinsky, Apollo starts with the birth of the god 
Apollo. Unwrapped by handmaidens, the fully grown Apollo 
(Calvin Kitten) explores life accompanied by the Muses 
(Poetry, Mime, and Dance and Song). Kitten delivered 
excellent form,, conveying in his expressions an Apollonian 
strength. Most smitten with the muse Terpsichore (Dance and 
Song), Apollo ends by ascending to Mount Olympus. Neo
classical with clean and clear movements, dance and story 
mesh well in Apollo because of its classical backdrop.

Glenn Hughes Music for the Divine And: Slipknot as performance artiil^ri On Max Tundra s lyrics
Is it just me, or does Chad Smith look way too much 
like Will Ferrell? Every time I thumb through the 
liner notes of a Chili Peppers disc, all I can think of 
is how those two must have been separated at birth.
I only bring that up because I've been jamming to 
the latest Glenn Hughes disc, which of course has 
Smith bringing the rhythm to Hughes soul. In every 
interview by the man whom many call the voice of 
rock," Hughes makes no secret of how the two are now 
musically wedded at the hip.
It may seem like an odd couple, or at least one of those

 but it works.
To be fair, Smith 
has a penchant 
for classic rock 
a la Kiss and 
Zeppelin, and, 
in retrospect, 
it shows
with RHCP
In any case, there aren't many iconic voices left now 
back from those days when dinosaurs ruled the earth, 
and it shows from the amount of work Hughes has 
had these last two years. He reunited briefly with Tony 
Iommi of Black Sabbath, for which Hughes was once 
the singer. (Actually, their effort was more of an Iommi 
solo album, not to mention a lost gem in my opinion.) 
.Since then, Hughes has released two solo albums with 
Smith on drums. On Music For The Divine, Hughes 
and Smith sit high upon their perch in the Hollywood 
Hills and infuse their common love for soul and funk 
into heavy, groovy riffs.
The latent joy shared by Hughes and Smith in having 
found each other is apparent throughout the recording. 
That intimacy is the most valuable asset these 
gentlemen have in their approach to working together. 
It's fun to listen to what some may term experimental 
tracks like "This is How I Feel,  its almost as if 
youre with them in the studio, and you want to reach 
into the speakers and tweak a few knobs to get it 
juuuuust right for them. Engaging the listener like that 
is no easy task, and what makes it even harder is that, 
individually, these two are already quite established
 each with his own previously distinct fan base.
With the rock world clamoring for bands to get back 
 together and reclaim the magic they once had, 
perhaps Hughes/Smith have got an idea here: Finding 
your musical soulmate isnt necessarily reuniting with 
the guys you shared success with before.

The lyrics arent always joyful; for example, "Black 
Light" speaks to the anger and sadness over the loss 
of a friend of Hughes. Still, theres a feeling that this 
album has yet to explore all that Hughes/Smith have 
to offer as a pair. In their melding of rock and soul, 
Steppin Out" and Youve Got Soul" even remind me 
of an early Lenny Kravitz, but tipping more toward 
early Motown. Its all wonderful stuff, which may or 
may not be commercial material  but then again lots 
of good music isnt.

However, 
after seeing 
them own 
the second 
stage at 
Ozzfest '98 
and then 
headline the
Tattoo the Earth festival two short years later, I can 
surely say that, firsthand, these men have something 
that many musicians lack. And it isnt showmanship. 
Rather, it is a form of communicating with their 
audience  live or living room  that resonates long 
after the music has stopped.
It is that primal connection that I find the most 
fascinating, and I have a feeling that this new film is 
going to be just as uneasy to watch as their music is 
to hear. The DVDs interviews, though, all delve into 
each of these nine mens unwavering opinions, many 
of which aren't even commonly held throughout the 
band. It is that tension of a nine-way marriage that 
could be the catalyst for the spectacle that is Slipknot. 
We'll see as I keep working through the film.

Max Tundras 2002 album, Mastered by Guy at the Exchange, (MBGATE) 
is 40 minutes of a sort of stilted, strange, hyperactive electronic pop, 
and rapidly became one of my favorite albums (now that I got around 
to listening to it a couple years late). Funnily enough  as my friends 
will tell you  I hate lyrics, but I've really been enjoying his. They have 
a wonderful brilliance and intelligence and an incredibly amateur quality, 
which is kind of confusing at first but becomes endearing.
MBGATE is Tundra at his most austere: It was some change which 
came upon me or upon the room/lndescribably subtle, yet momentous, 
ineffable. Get out your thesaurus. But then, dont, because next is 
Lysine," a musing on the importance of that amino acid. There are a few 
meditations on Tundras day jobs (Lights") and friends (Acorns), and a 
hilarious song which is simply a request that director Michel Gondry make 
a video for him (but: Judging by your clients/Twould cost a weighty 
fee/To make me an Around The World/Or Let Forever Be).
However, one topic appears to be the focus. Like seemingly every lyric 
ever written, Max Tundras are all about women. Cabasa is the first and 
most explicit paean:
Thinking back to when I asked Naomi out/Sitting around in a wooden 
classroom/Planning my line with a friend from Cornwall/Hiding my 
erection with a book by Morrish/Misread smiles and summer promise/ 
Intervening love between the years/Has made me understand/i'm glad 
Naomi turned me down.
In Labial," about stealing his best friends girlfriend, Tundra makes a 
snide complaint about the other man and reflects on his current situation:
Id like to be as articulate as Mr. UWriting songs about Barbara of Seville/ 
Such a wonderful way with a pen when hes feeling unwell/l only sing 
about things that happen to me/l never learnt how to fill my songs with 
allegory/While my peers paid attention in English I thought about how/l 
could undress that girl who appeared in my life with a pow/Never mind 
that she slipped from my hand because look at me now.
My favorite moment, though, is the beginning of Hilted, yet another 
song about some girl from his past:
Six seconds in your company makes me feel upset/That Ive only known 
you for six seconds yet.
Is it possible to more clearly express the mood of the beginning of a 
relationship? I dont think so. Maybe Im beginning to see what I've been 
missing while I ignored lyrics all this time.

Anatomy of a Boyfriend
Move over Judy Blume, its the 21 st century
Elizabeth Liu | Art Staff
circumstances, Wes attempt to stimulate Dom for the first 
time could have been a highly erotic scene, but the pairs 
inexperience takes away any chance of being turned on. "I've 
only a vague concept of what I am supposed to do," Wes says. 
So Ill need some instruction. Before the scene develops into 
anything hot and steamy, Dom screams  not out'of pleasure. 
She explains, "I hope I don't look as annoyed as I am, but that 
was not fun.
By April, Dom cannot stand to be away from Wes, and her 
incredibly strong feelings for him begin to affect all aspects of 
her life. Soon she is ready to give up an academic scholarship 
to Tulane and instead attend NYU because she cannot bear 
the thought of being away from him. With some hesitation, 
Dom eventually decides that Tulane. fits best with her 
ambition of becoming a surgeon. She and Wes, Dom hopes, 
are capable of pulling off a long-distance relationship.
The much-awaited sex scene occurs after prom, but is 
far from stimulating to the reader. As expected, Dom is in 
immediate and incredible pain. Wes feels awful for hurting 
her and deems their first time as "kinda crummy. Trying to 
encourage him, Dom insists, It wasn't crummy! The first 
' time is supposed to be weird  if it were great on the first try, 
we'd have nothing to aim for later.
Because the protagonist of the story is only 17, Anatomy of 
a Boyfriend may be more appealing to high school rather 
than college students. However, it is always refreshing to 
look back upon awkward adolescent experience  once 
life-ruining, now hilarious. Snadowskys sexual explicitness 
and references to technology provide a much-needed update 
. to the more conservative-Judy Blume classic. With Anatomy 
of a Boyfriend, perhaps Snadowsky can continue in Blumes 
legacy of helping young girls discover themselves and their 
sexualities.
Jennifer Damico | Junior Staffwriter
Following this first kiss, Snadowsky 
holds nothing back in her description 
of the couple's emotional and 
physical interactions; she follows 
Dom and Wes as they touch all the 
bases on the sexual playing field 
for the first time. One particularly 
amusing scene takes place in Wes 
parked Explorer, where the two 
amateurs attempt to satisfy each
After 80 pages of sexual tension (and no action), 
Dom begins to wonder if Wes is gay or asexual. 
That is, until one night when she and Wes 
are home alone, when he finally gives 
her that coveted first kiss. "The first 
few seconds were weird, I guess 
because it was so new, and our teeth 
kept knocking together," she reports 
to her best friend Amy the next day.
"But soon we were sucking face 
just like they do in the movies.
In the 70s, '80s, and '90s, Judy Blume's Are You There God? 
It's Me, Margaret was essential reading for young girls on 
the verge of puberty. The amusing and true-to-life narrative 
answers many of the questions its readers may have about 
their changing bodies and newly discovered sexualities. Daria 
Snadowsky's Anatomy of a Boyfriend, which is dedicated to 
Judy Blume, attempts to update this rite-of-passage story. 
Snadowsky introduces a-post-millennium character who 
has passed through puberty and is now prepared to learn  
through experiences.
Dominique Baley, the virgin protagonist, identifies 
herself as perhaps the only 17-year-old who has 
never French-kissed before, but she has her reasons; 
she explains, "In my experience all guys can be 
classified as either assholes or bores, unless theyre 
both." Dominique's prejudices, however, take a 
drastic turn when she meets the gorgeous track 
star Wesley Gershwin and begins to experience 
the pounding heart, sweaty palms, and stomach 
butterflies symptomatic of her first case of lovesickness. 
Loyal to the 21st century, Snadowsky includes e-mails 
and IM conversations between Dom and Wes, adding to 
the authenticity of both the characters' voices and the 
development of their relationship, which pushes past the 
platonic toward romance.
other. It takes almost a whole page for Wes to figure out how 
to unhook a bra, while Dom compares taking off Wes shirts 
to trying to change a sleepy, uncooperative four-year-old 
into his pajamas. Before they have a chance to "go all the 
way, a cop comes knocking on the windows of the Explorer 
 sending the two naked teens into a 
terrified frenzy as they grope for their 
clothes and pray not to be arrested. 
This ends their first naked sexual 
encounter with a bit more 
excitement than even Dom 
and Wes had anticipated.
In Anatomy, Snadowsky 
demonstrates a unique 
talent in her ability to 
create a character so true 
to life. Through Dom, 
Snadowsky captures how 
un-romantic and nervewracking early sexual 
experiences can be, without 
neglecting the excitement 
and personal significance 
of a young relationship.

Creative nonfiction: From robots to transplants
Author Lee Gutkind is experiencing life, one book at a time
University of Pittsburgh professor Lee Gutkind will be 
releasing his newest book, Almost Human, later this month. 
Last Tuesday, Gutkind visited Wean Hall to discuss both 
the content of his book and, to a lesser extent, its research 
process. Almost Human is centered around Carnegie 
Mellon's Robotics Institute  its faculty, staff, and students. 
Gutkind focuses on five key players in the field of robotics, 
including four Carnegie Mellon faculty members and a NASA 
scientist. He also focuses on the robots themselves; Almost 
Human documents both their successes and their failures.
At his lecture, Gutkind said that a robot named Zoe was the 
"primary motivator... of [the] book." In the text, he begins by 
describing Zoes shortcomings and problems. Throughout 
the book, however, Gutkind documents the process of her 
evolution from a simple machine into the first robot scientist.
Gutkind decided to write the book after being approached 
by Anne Watzman, thedirector of public relations for both 
the Robotics Institute and the School of Computer Science. 
While Gutkind was working for National Public Radio, 
Watzman asked him to cover RoboCup, a soccer game pitting 
robots against other robots; in particular, Sony AIBOs were 
programmed to make their own decisions based on situations 
in the game. Gutkind returned to Carnegie Mellon a few years 
later, this time to write a book about the Robotics Institute.
With the help of Watzman, Gutkind gained special access to 
the facilities for his research. He spent four years observing 
the roboticists, who both build and program robots, at the 
Robotics Institute. Gutkind described his research as having 
three phases. First, he observe^ the day-to-day activities that 
took place in the institute, immersing himself in his subjects' 
lives in order to "see the world through their eyes. Second, 
Gutkind spoke one-on-one with the roboticists in order to 
hear their thoughts on what they had accomplished and how, 
in some cases, they had fallen short. Finally, he spent time 
reading other sources to learn as much as he could about the. 
subject.
"Although you are writing about something specific, you 
need to move it to a more global orientation, Gutkind said,
explaining the importance of general research. By offering a 
glimpse into the mysterious field of robotics, Gutkind makes 
his books appeal to a broader audience. Gutkind is anxious for 
people in the robotics world to read Almost Human as well, 
and he hopes that the book will help to bridge the information 
gap between different robotics facilities. The more people 
that read it, the better," he said.
Besides robotics, Gutkind has immersed himself in many 
other interesting fields, including the motorcycle subculture 
and organ transplants. Bike Fever, Gutkind's first book, 
took him across the country via motorcycle  all part of his 
research on the subculture and the on the road movement. 
During that time, Gutkind explained, it was much safer and 
more exciting to travel cross-country on a motorcycle.
For Gutkind, his exploration of the world of organ 
transplantation was the most memorable. While working 
on Many Sleepless Nights, he spent four years shadowing 
surgeons, scrubbing in on surgeries, and watching lives saved 
and'lost. While researching the book, Gutkind explained, he 
experienced what seemed like every imaginable procedure 
and set of circumstances. To be so fully immersed in such a 
world was the most "exhausting, heartwarming, and exciting" 
of his experiences.
Creative Nonfiction
Outside of authoring books, Gutkind is also the founder and 
editor of the journal Creative Nonfiction, the first to specialize 
in the genre. According to Gutkind, he founded the journal in 
order to transform this "new" genre into a legitimate literary 
form. The journal helped solidify the genre as a movement, in 
addition to bridging its domains from the world of journalism 
to that of academia.
The journal Creative Nonfiction [helped] to introduce the 
genre to people who hadnt otherwise thought of what 
distinguished creative nonfiction from plain old nonfiction,  
said Jane Bernstein, a professor in the English department. 
While it is now accepted throughout the literary world, there
are still many people who are confused as to what the term 
"creative nonfiction" means. Gutkind described it as a "blend 
of real life and literature, and much more challenging." He 
compared creative nonfiction to robotics. When we look 
ahead to the future in technology, we see robotics moving in, 
he said. In creative nonfiction, people laughed when I started 
my journal, but now 15 years later  it is the fastestgrowing genre of publishing in the academic world.
Both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh offer 
courses in creative nonfiction. At Carnegie Mellon, several 
courses are offered: A workshop on the essay is taught by 
Hilary Masters; courses in literary journalism and science 
writing are taught by Jane McCafferty; and Bernstein 
teaches courses on the memoir and creative nonfiction. At 
the University of Pittsburgh, Gutkind started a program for 
creative nonfiction students to graduate with a Master's 
of Fine Arts degree. Requiring MFA candidates to write 
a publishable manuscript, the program is professionally 
oriented.
In creative nonfiction, Bernstein explained, lots of good 
stories are told in innovative ways by excellent writers. That's 
the heart of it. Besides Gutkind, other key figures in creative 
nonfiction include Truman Capote {In Cold Blood), Gay Talese 
(Unto the Sons), Norman Mailer (Armies of the Night), Tom 
Wolfe (The Painted Word), and John McPhee (Annals of the 
Former World), all of whom Bernstein believes have changed 
American literature. .

Clipse performs at Rex Theatre
Role Models? No. Badasses? Yes.
You either love Clipse or hate it. You either find the bands 
witty-but-sincere lines about drug dealing to be snappy and 
clever, or completely banal. You either find its beats badass, 
dark, and spooky, or just plain cheesy. You either love Clipse 
or hate it.
Clipse  composed of two brothers, Malice and Pusha T
 rolled through Pittsburgh Thursday night at the Rex 
Theatre and brought every drop of sincerity that a respectable 
rap group of this caliber should have. Rapping to a racially, 
stylistically, and age-diverse crowd, the brothers wer% 
focused, down-to-earth, and intense, just like their music.
Whereas many rappers strut around stage with bloated egos, 
Clipse was always in the music, crouching low as each verse 
climbed in intensity and climaxed with grit. On Momma Im 
So Sorry," the show's opener, Malice crudely admitted his 
faults, rapping, "Momma Im so sorry/I'm so obnoxious/I got 
two hot rocks in my pocket." Malice himself came across as 
sarcastic, but the beat itself was just as caustic  a whiny 
accordion dangled above a metallic high-hat shimmy.
As the semi-packed crowd started chanting the hook to "Keys 
Open Doors" in unison, Clipse broke into the spooky track 
with full force (are we chanting for "keys or kilos?). The
ghostly synthesizer and clickity-clack of obscure percussion 
gave you goose bumps. And if the bounce isnt enough to 
make you pay some respect, maybe some clever, drug-tinged 
lyricism will: Open up the Frigidaire, 25 to life in here/So 
much white you might think ya Holy Christ is near." It's a 
balls-out lifestyle, but someone's gotta do it.
The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo) took all 
production duties on Clipse's most recent record, Hell Hath 
No Fury. Since the record's release in November 2006, Clipse 
has enjoyed acclaim from critics as diverse as XXL and 
Pitchfork. Commercially, however, the record has sold only 
moderately. Many attribute this to the never-ending drama 
between Clipse and its label, Jive Records. The unspoken 
problem didnt go unspoken for long, though, when Pusha 
T finally shouted, Fuck Jive!" Thursday night. The crowd 
shouted in approval.
The energy stayed pumping through older Clipse tracks, 
including the club-friendly Grindin." But it was Hell Hath 
No Furys Wamp Wamp (What It Do) that really got the 
crowd jumping. Rapping over the impossibly heavy thwack 
of steel drums and trash-can percussion, Malice showed off 
his never-ending sense of trickery (and drug referencing): 
The feds don't know so they stick they noses/While we off
Joe Negri visits Carnegie Hall
Student 6:30 band plays beside renowned jazz guitarist
Its a rare treat to play with someone considered a jazz 
guitar legend, but Carnegie Mellon's 6:30 band got to do just 
that this past Wednesday night. Joe Negri, a jazz guitarist 
also known to younger audiences for his appearances on 
Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, was the guest artist for the 
performance at Carnegie Music Hall this past week.
David Pellow directed both his 4:30 and 6:30 bands through 
a two-hour performance with visible passion. His animated 
persona engaged the audience even before the music had 
a chance to, and he remained as entertaining as the music 
itself. The 4:30 band opened the show with a strong set, 
including particularly good renditions of Thad Jones' A Child 
is Born" and Charles Mingus' "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat. A 
Child is Born" featured first-year CIT student David DeBaun, 
who played a passionate cadenza on the piano; "Goodbye 
Pork Pie Hat" was the second of a three-part Mingus medley, 
which featured an impressive tenor sax solo by sophomore 
mechanical engineering major Randolph Scott-McLaughlin n. 
The last part of the Mingus medley brought senior computer 
science major Eli Gwynn to the front of the stage for an 
extended, energetic performance on the baritone sax.
It wasn't until after the 6:30 band played a few songs 
that Negri made his big appearance, playing an amped 
acoustic through Fats Waller's "Honeysuckle Rose," which 
was followed by what were likely the two strongest sets, 
Charlie Christians Solo Flight" and Antonio Carlos Jobim's 
"Corcavado." Allison Decker provided beautiful vocals for
Corcavado," a Portuguese piece. Two other stand-out 
performances came from Lyle Chamberlain, a graduate 
student in the Robotics Institute, on tenor sax, and Bob 
Kircher, a senior music major, on trumpet.
The highlight of the night may well have been the impromptu 
duet between Negri and Pellow, with Pellow on bass. 
Together, they played a well-synchronized rendition of jazz 
standard "All the Things You Are," showing their abilities to 
anticipate the other's next move. Gwynn said, "I would make 
it a point to own a recording of this concert if for no other 
reason than to have a recording of that song."
The performance satisfied its players as well as its audience. 
Following the duet, Pellow announced to the audience, I can 
die now.

Clipse may flaunt, deal, and party, but when it comes time 
to get to work, they are clever, crude, and  above all
 original. Even though it took four years to put out Hell Hath

1. Did you think Pans Labyrinth 
deserved the hype? It only won 
three Oscars (Art Direction, 
Cinematography, and Makeup), 
but it was the subject of a lot of 
talk.
When a fantastic movie comes along 
(its rare nowadays), it should be 
recognized as what it is. LS
I think Pan's Labyrinth definitely 
deserved the hype in terms of the 
more technical aspects of film 
production, such as art direction and 
cinematography. JT
Yes! Only because it is a foreign film. I 
love foreign films! Yay! RC
Regarding Pan's Labyrinth, I think it 
definitely deserved the hype. I saw the 
movie and was really impressed with 
the fantasy elements.... It may not have 
won a lot of awards, but it was very 
provocative and deserving of attention. 
AC
2. Did Jennifer Hudson deserve 
the Best Actress in a Supporting 
Role Oscar? Why or why not?
Her voice and performance were 
beyond fabulous in Dreamgirls. JT
Well, I mean, there were definitely other 
really great women in the category. But 
I saw half of Dreamgirls. The other half 
was ruined when the sub-par movie 
theater accidently cut off the movie. 
What I mean is: Jennifer Hudson was 
excellent in the first half of Dreamgirls 
and she deserved every bit. RC
3. What do you think was the 
biggest movie to "get robbed at 
the Oscars?
Babel got robbed. BD
Inland Empire. David Lynch is brilliant, 
and the Academy is full of people with 
no artistic vision who dont see that. Or 
Children of Men. LS
Babel\ I mean, not that Ive seen that 
movie. But my ... obsession with Gael 
Garca Bemal  who had some kind of 
role in the movie  proves that Babel 
should have won. RC
4. What was the most-deserved 
Oscar win this year? The least?
Best Director [Martin Scorsese]  most 
deserved. JT
Scorsese definitely deserved the Best 
Director Oscar for The Departed. The 
least? Probably Babel. Nothing about 
that film impressed me  especially 
not Dakota Fanning Jr. LS
Seriously, I didnt think The Departed 
was worth the hype. Not that I've seen 
it. But most movies with Leonardo 
DiCaprio and/or Jack Nicholson ... don't 
particularly impress me. Maybe it was 
good because of that director man with 
the intense eyebrows and complex last 
name. RC
The Departed deserved it big time.
LK
5. What did you think of the 
green theme that the Oscars 
had, with An Inconvienent Truth 
and various speeches centering on 
being green"?
I want someone to explain to me the 
real reason A1 Gore was at the Oscars. 
Bill Clinton would have been a lot more 
fun.RC
I think its funny that even the 
Animated Feature fit into the theme. I 
mean, Happy Feet ends with about 10 
minutes of warning its younger viewers 
that we should save the environment.
PN
Hollywood tends to ruin good things 
sometimes. Fads change: Green is the 
new anti-Bush. (Is lime still in?) LK
While Im never really a fan of any sort 
of political propaganda entering the 
entertainment realm, I believe that 
green awareness and preserving our 
natural resources is so important, and 
that we are at such a crucial point 
in the climate crisis, that awareness 
needs to be raised anywhere and 
everywhere. JT
6. Whos the hottest Oscar winner 
this year?
The penguin from Happy Feet. LS
Gael didnt win, right? That's right. 
Nobody, then. RC
7. What was this year's most 
surprising win?

minutes, but I couldn't leave the TV for 
an hour because she was funny and I 
kept wondering what shed do next.

I think that usually hosts of the 
Oscars are pretty dry. Ellen was mildly 
entertaining. Like when she whipped 
out a digital camera and had Steven 
Spielberg take a picture of her with 
some old man. By "old man I mean 
Clint Eastwood. RC

A quick guide to:
You may be wondering  what exactly is silk-screening? Also known as 
screen-printing, silk-screening is a printmaking process that was popularized 
through the pop art movement in the 1960s. Andy Warhol's Campbells Soup Cans" 
is a familiar example of silk-screening. In the process, different screens are laid upon 
each other to create layers of one image, with one color per screen. Need more? 
Here are the basic steps.
Prepare a picture. It can be drawn by hand or from the computer, text or images. 
The image is printed on clear film.
Expose the film. Put the film on top of the screen, which is coated with a 
light-sensitive photo mold. The film and screen are placed on top of an exposure 
base  AIR uses a vacuum table for its professional artists, and a light table for 
open studio nights. Both do the same thing, but in different ways. The vacuum table 
forces excess air out with the press of a button; the light table requires a heavy 
wooden block to do the same thing. Both tables have a source of light. This entire 
process should take about 10 minutes.

Its a vast studio space on the North Side, walls plastered with ads, posters, and various 
artwork. It's not quite a gallery  more of a gallery/studio/print shop. The ever-expanding 
Artist Image Resource (AIR) was founded on a new approach to contemporary culture: the 
artist and the community.
It began as just an idea. [We thought of] what kind of organizations didnt exist in 
Pittsburgh that would facilitate creative work and help artists, said Robert Beckman, 
AIRs diiector. That was 1994, and print shops were sparse in the Pittsburgh area. So 
came the plan for a space with printmaking components, but not strictly print-making 
components.
AIRs founders also wanted a way to share their own art, because, as Beckman admitted 
with a laugh, there is never enough exhibition space. Moreover, Beckman and others 
hoped AIR would become a place that could be open to the community as a source of 
information and instruction. Two years later, Beckman discovered AIR's current space  a 
former storefront on the North Sides Foreland Street. He credits John Mueller, of Muellers 
Hardware Inc. We had done business together, Beckman said, "and he allowed us to 
come into the space and put the place together." Since then, AIR has been improving 
upon its venue, expanding it in parts so as to broaden the possibilities.
In addition to the contributing artists  from both the staff and the community  there 
are hardworking volunteers. One such volunteer, Nathan Mould, began as a silk-screening 
intern. Mould credited an open house at AIR as part of what inspired him to become more 
involved. Like the rest of the willing staff, Mould's main motivation is simply to help. That, 
and pumpin out my own art, he said.
Were all kind of in this together; people need to realize that, Beckman said. To 
demonstrate that to the community, AIR initiated open-studio time in 2003 as a chance to 
bring in young artists and make AIR more accessible to the public.
Beckman admitted that, over the years, some people have taken AIRs time and space 
for granted. Still, he wanted to be able to continue offering the space to the community; 
Beckman emphasized the importance of art that is accessible to many different points of 
view, especially those within the Pittsburgh community.
The staff goes above and beyond in its quest to support art. Artists have an opportunity 
to rent out the shop and use the materials to suit their needs; there are tutorials on 
Wednesday evenings and prospective artists can make appointments for private tutorials 
starting from $75 a lesson. Alternatively, open-studio nights operate on a first-come,
The year 1996 saw the initiation of what has since become an annual tradition; December 
1996 was AIRs first resident artist project exhibition, a show featuring seven artists print 
projects. Since then, AIR has exhibited four to six professional artists every December. 
"Every year, significant things happen, Beckman said.

---------------------------------------------------

first-serve basis. We try to have people in those evening circumstances that can kind of 
facilitate what you're doing, Beckman said.
And the artist-run resource center strives to convey forward-thinking ideas, culture, and 
inspiration. "We're not just a T-shirt place," said Bill Rodgers, a staff member charged with 
the aspects of operation and workforce. Our mission is important. You have to believe 
it." The mission, according to AIR's website, is to support creative interest and activity 
through an active imaging lab.
"First and foremost, we are a production facility," Beckman said. The space is for 
professional artists to work and create. But prompting a communitys interest in art is 
important too, as is bringing artists in from that community. "What artists do is valuable, 
and that... [people] have access to the thinking, the questions that artists are asking, the 
methods that artists are using to find those answers.... Thats valuable, Beckman said.
Interaction is another concept significant to AIRs mission. Theres more to an artists 
work than gathering around it at a gallery showing. Beckman encourages asking artists 
questions: Why this color? Why this shape? Why this size? What is the basis of that 
decision?
"[Were] fostering cultural awareness, said Rodgers. That includes bringing students 
in for workshops and tutorials to demonstrate various printmaking processes. Students 
from schools in the Pittsburgh area  including Schenley High School, Pittsburgh High 
School for the Creative and Performing Arts, and North Allegheny High School  come 
to experience AIRs approach (that is, combining the best aspects of galleries, studios, 
and print shops) and to learn techniques such as relief, intaglio, and lithography. "It's not 
academia, its not [an] after-school [program], Rodgers said. We teach people so they 
can produce. In addition, internships are offered for college credit at schools including 
Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and Clarion University.
As a nonprofit organization, AIR is technically a public charity. The organizations that 
give AIR funding have been extremely helpful, Beckman said. The Heinz Endowment, a 
small arts initiative funding stream, [has been] pretty instrumental, he said. Over 13 other 
organizations or groups donate to AIR as well.
With the white walls framed with prints and art, and paint-splattered aprons hanging on 
various hooks, AIR is surrounded by the feeling of a creative community. Artists works 
and inspirations meet the eye at every turn. It is not your traditional print shop. Or gallery. 
Or studio. Its more like all of them combined.
So dont call it a T-shirt shop.
silk-screening
Wash the screen. The areas exposed to the light are cooked and harden; then, 
these hardened parts fall off during the rinsing. That leaves the desired image burned 
onto the screen. Place the screen in front of a fan to dry for about 10 minutes.
Print it! Tape the edges of the screen, so that ink doesnt get through. The dry 
screen is placed on the material of choice (usually a poster or T-shirt), and ink is 
placed across the top of the screen. Use a squeegee to push the ink through the 
image. (If you have multiple screens, this process is repeated.) And after that, youre 
a silk-screener extraordinaire.

with cancer.

wrote his thesis, Ether 
Steeds, in appreciation of 
his native Southern dialect.
Cancer, hilarity, horses, and dreams
New Works Festival showcases graduate student theses
The New Works Festival provides a venue for the thesis 
plays of graduate playwrights before the pieces are shown 
to agents in New York City. These students have spent the 
past semester developing scripts and working with graduate 
directors, lighting designers, and undergraduate actors, each 
to produce what graduate playwright Christopher Dimond 
describes as a "work in progress...open for feedback from 
other writers, actors, and instructors. Because the thesis 
plays are workshop pieces, actor involvement is key in the 
creative process; Dimond emphasized the importance of the 
entire journey rather than the creation of a finished product. 
For his musical Dani Gill, he collaborated with fellow artist 
and musician Michael Kooman, who provides musical 
accompaniment for School of Drama productions. Dimond 
said creative differences led the two to push each other to 
move the script forward and improve it.
Both Dimond and fellow grad student Jason Williamson, who 
wrote Ether Steeds for his thesis, hope to see their plays take 
off on a larger scale, ideally on Broadway. Williamson credits 
his education within the graduate program for his exponential 
growth as a writer. His play engages the theme of human 
loneliness as it plays out in its Southern setting, indicative 
of his North Carolina upbringing. Admitting his resentment 
for "the politics of the South, Williamson said he stopped 
ignoring the poetry of the language he grew up around" and 
turned it into something beautiful.
Graduate student Ed Iskandar directed Ether Steeds, and 
he and Williamson collaborated extensively on developing 
the script while paying special attention to serving the text 
itself" and preserving the project's primary intent  forming 
Williamson's thesis.
Ether Steeds follows the lives of restless, imaginative teenage 
girl Skeeta and her abusive alcoholic mother. The object of 
the womens combined affections, Emory, creates conflict
between mother and daughter, as does Skeeta's late father 
who reappears in his daughter's dreams. A supernatural 
tone runs throughout the play, and the ghostly blue lighting 
effectively conveys a sense of eeriness. Williamson cleverly 
evokes what he calls the "poetry of the [Southern] dialect" 
in his beautifully crafted dialogue, but the repetition of 
select phrases, including bits and pieces, eventually grows 
tiresome as the phrases lose their effect.
Motifs of teeth, biting, and stinging exemplify the basic 
human survivalist instinct, one that explains the selfish 
behavior that Skeetas unhinged mother repeatedly displays 
toward her daughter. While Williamson captures the 
growing distance between hopeless mother and hopeful 
daughter, the dynamic between the two lacks believability 
on stage. Skeetas mother, still reeling from her husbands 
death, verbally abuses her daughter in an expression of 
misappropriated contempt and as a feeble attempt to narrow 
the palpable gap that separates the two and defines their 
relationship. Often distracted and poorly versed in human 
interaction, Skeeta fumbles through a flirtation with reserved, 
handsome Emory. Truly, the play's greatest achievement 
lies in the portrayal of Skeetas coming of age  remarkably 
conveyed by senior actor Susan Goodwillie  in the face 
of the dreams that haunt her, the surroundings that restrict 
her, and the longing for a true union that ultimately eludes 
her. Goodwillie's performance, a conscientious tour de 
force, drives the entire show and evokes the sympathy of 
the audience. At once captivating and heartbreaking, Ether 
Steeds reminds us that we are all alone, that we can search 
endlessly for sincerity and community and still end up 
disappointed.
The second New Works Festival production, Dimond's Dani 
Girl, is a work that musically depicts a seven-year-olds battle 
with cancer. Reminiscent of Noah Haidle's Mr. Marmalade, 
Dani playfully interacts with her flamboyant imaginary
friend and guardian angel Raph, a constant source of comic 
relief. Full of pop culture references, edgy racial jokes, and 
side-splitting wordplay, the script shines and grasps the 
audience from start to finish. However, the play comments 
upon its own cleverness, never failing to point out its own 
irony, which subtracts from the sharp, witty writing.
School of Drama graduate Marissa Lesch plays Dani, and 
although she performs with unflagging conviction, her 
overzealous enthusiasm shifts the audience's focus away from 
the gravity of her characters plight. The score falls short of 
sensational, with the lyrical quality surpassing the technical 
composition, but the actors sing phenomenally, especially 
School of Drama junior Liam Rhodes, who plays Marty, Danis 
fellow cancer patient and partner in crime.
According to Dimond, one of the initial challenges in writing 
Dani Girl was negotiating "where the tenderness, truth, and 
humor come into the play, balancing levity with gravity. He 
effectively uses humor while portraying children tackling 
mature themes such as death, divorce, drugs, and the central 
unanswerable question "Why is cancer?" and with the 
appearance of God as a character, Dani Girl also addresses 
religion. Rather than coming off as preachy, this technique 
helps to sensitively explore the differing ways in which 
children and adults cope with mortality. At its heart, the play 
entertains and saddens but lacks focus, attempting to include 
several subplots that cannot be fully developed in the shadow 
of Danis tearjerking fate.

A lesson in womens history
Gerda Lerner lectures on creativity and change
"When students tell me that womens history is no longer a 
valid field, I dont know whether to weep, cut my throat, or 
shake them until they wake up, said Gerda Lerner, who is 
credited as one of the first pioneers of women's history. Lerner 
gave a lecture last Wednesday as the inaugural speaker for 
the Margaret Morrison Distinguished Lecture in Womens 
History Series.
Lerner has not only devoted her life to raising awareness of 
women's history in America; shes lived through harrowing 
and challenging times 
herself. Born in 1920 in 
Austria, Lerner spent 
almost two months in a 
Nazi prison as a young 
girl. When she escaped 
to America in 1939, it 
was without her family.
As a refugee, Lerner 
struggled alone to forge 
a life for herself. She later 
married Hollywood film 
editor and director Carl 
Lerner, and the couple 
fought to unionize the 
film industry and put 
an end to Hollywood 
blacklisting. Lerner also 
joined the Congress of 
American Women, a group devoted to economic and social 
issues facing American women, and worked for civil rights 
and education issues in New York.
At age 38, Lerner returned to school, eventually earning 
her Ph.D. in history from Columbia University. Her work in 
academia is geared toward gaining recognition for those 
overlooked in American history by promoting a deeper 
understanding of womens history and expanding the profile 
of both African-American and lower-class women. Lerner 
taught courses on women's history at Long Island University, 
Columbia University, the New School for Social Research, 
and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she now 
teaches as professor emerita of history. At Sarah Lawrence 
College, Lerner created the nation's first master's program 
in women's history; she later created the nations first Ph.D. 
program in the same field at the University of WisconsinMadison.
Lerners lecture last Wednesday night reflected her 
ongoing passion for womens rights  not only as a field 
in academia, but as a concern in contemporary American 
society. The lecture addressed popular misconceptions about 
the backgrounds of women involved in the Seneca Falls 
Convention of 1848, the first womens rights convention held 
in the United States. Lerner praised the convention for its 
revolutionary impact, but thought many important details 
about its organizers have been glossed over in the public's 
long forgetting and short remembering of womens history in 
America." The organizers, Lerner stated, had more religious
affiliation and far more previous organizational experience 
than is commonly acknowledged.
Sonya Barclay, a graduate student in Carnegie Mellons 
history department, reminisced about an inspiring experience 
she had with Lerner as an undergraduate. This world-class 
historian, this big name, had a seminar with all these 
under grads, and sat down at a table with a notebook and 
pencil and took down all of our names and interests, she said. 
That's a model of a real scholar. Real scholars want to know
what students have 
to say.
Indeed, at 
the lecture on 
Wednesday, Lerner 
asked to hear from 
the young people 
in the audience, 
desiring their 
feedback on what 
she'd presented.
Lisa Tetrault, an 
assistant professor 
in the historySonya Barclay department and
a graduate of the 
Ph.D. program 
at University of 
Wisconsin-Madison founded by Lerner, said that if it were 
not for Lerner, she would not be in the field herself. Tetrault 
credited Lerner with giving students today the luxury of a 
rich culture of womens history."
Although she acknowledged many goals that feminism has 
accomplished, Lerner also called attention to inequalities 
in class and race in America. Lerner urged the lecture 
attendees to work for social change, describing feminism as 
a movement extending beyond only women and beyond a 
specific period in history as a world philosophy for men and 
women, a record of solid gains without the cost of bloody wars 
and revolutions."
Lerner believes that many issues assigned to feminism 
signal underlying problems in society as a whole. "To call 
these women's issues is an insult to men  these are human 
issues," she said. Lerner asked the audience, as members 
of the university system, to especially consider inequalities 
in the availability of education. She called for greater 
government aid for single parents and other providers in 
pursuit of higher education.
Joe Trotter, head of the history department at Carnegie 
Mellon, added that Lerners contributions to society and 
academia go beyond the so-called confines of womens 
history." Lerners expertise extends across a number of sub
fields; shes opened up the field of African-American women's 
history, among others," he said. She is truly an educational 
model."
This world-class historian, this 
big name, has a seminar with all 
these undergrads, and sat down 
at a table with a notebook and 
pencil and took down all of our 
names and interests.

Gerda Lerner, a pivotal figure in women's history, lectures 
last Wednesday in Baker Hall's Giant Eagle Auditorium.
Lerner, who worked as a filmmaker and screenwriter with her 
husband Carl, also emphasized the importance of creativity as 
a means of social change. "Creativity is a basic need, like food 
and shelter. People need to create," she said. "Thesexes have 
been given stifling roles in terms of creativity  what we 
are allowed to do and express. You must nurture the creative 
impulse as a way to sustain yourself." Lerner also encouraged 
the audience to get together in small groups and discuss their 
concerns about the world, citing this as an effective model 
for social reform. Social and cultural transformations must 
sustain awareness of change, or it will fade. New inequities 
and grievances arrive with every generation....Talk together 
about what is-standing in your way, about what is stopping 
you," she advised. "Small groups can change the world.

On (Antichrist Television Blues), Butler triumphantly declare 
over a blues progression, I dont want to work in the buildin 
downtown.
Still, Arcade Fires new record lacks the sheer power of 
Funeral. There is simply no song on here that matches the 
force of Power Out or Wake Up. But a change in sound 
is always a bold move, and the group has matched a more 
carefully produced album with accessible, innovative, and 
catchy songwriting. Go out and grab Neon Bible; you wont 
regret it.
Matt Siffert | Assistant Pillbox Editor
Arcade Fire releases Neon Bible
Montreals indie rock sensation takes a bold step forward
The pressure is on for Arcade Fire. After nabbing the torch 
from The Strokes in 2003 as the next indie rock band to break 
into the mainstream with Funeral, the group will release its 
second album, Neon Bible, this Tuesday. The question now 
is what the group will do with its surprisingly youthful energy, 
glorious songwriting, and celebrity endorsements (from David 
Bowie, Coldplay, and others).
Neon Bible wastes no time reminding listeners that the band 
members are still the energetic risk-takers that they were 
several years ago. The ground rumbles and sweeps as Black 
Mirror quickly kicks into gear. Chromatic string lines tense up 
and release as pumping acoustic guitars heave underneath 
lead singer Win Butler, who growls with the same restrained 
ferocity hes had since Wake Up. Arcade Fire is back.
Grooves have always been a center part of Arcade Fires 
music, and this record is no different. One of the groups 
best tunes to date comes next with "Keep the Car Running."
1 he opening vamp chugs just like the title suggests, with 
pizzicato violins and reverbed guitars sticking into the groove 
as the '60s-rock drums shuffle along; Arcade Fire has never 
sounded this tight, ever.
Dont think that Arcade Fire has lost its folk influence though. 
Fans of Funerals Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles) will dig 
the lullaby-ish hymn that is the new albums title track. The 
brooding melody creeps underneath the breezy texture of a 
piano, a simple bass drum thump, and the always-astounding 
string section.
At the core of Arcade Fires music seems to be some 
compelling awareness of church and politics  be it the 
band members five-night stint in New York's Judson 
Memorial Church, or even their cries for freedom in Funerals 
"Haiti - and the new record is no different. The fabulous 
Intervention is glazed with a church organ, while Mr. Butler 
cries, Working for the church while your family dies ... every 
spark of friendship and love will die without a home." And just 
as Butler sings, "Hear the soldier groan all quiet and alone a 
simple brush flick on a crash cymbal cues the stampede of 
one of the fattest, biggest, freshest bands in the game.
Arcade Fire matrimonial powerhouse Win 
Butler and Rgine Chassagne are leaders 
behind the band's new album, Neon Bible.
The reappearance of "No Cars Go should please fans that 
dug the groups EP. A careful listen to the two versions will 
prove that Arcade Fires sound is truly developing; theyre 
not quite the raw, anthem band that they were several years 
ago. Their sound is a bit softer, more refined  synthesizers 
breeze between textured string lines, all pumping underneath 
the accordion melody. And just when you think Arcade Fire 
has gone all sissy on you, drummer Jeremy Gara pulls out a 
snappy snare drum pattern to give the track an extra kick.
Church and politics aside, the album is still wrought with 
plenty of internal conflict. In The Well and The Lighthouse, 
Butler pleads, Left for dead... heaven is only in my head. 
Time signatures jump from an indie rock cranker to a 
blues-like shuffle, just as confused as Butler himself.

Last Friday was the opening night of Unsigned Cards, an exhibit at the 
Frame by sophomore art major Ryan Woodring.The installation included 
animations and paintings, in addition to Woodring's experimentations 
with texture. Woodring created a unique effect by hanging (and then 
puncturing) bags of paint from the ceiling. Halfway through opening 
night, Unsigned Cards featured a performance by the same name.
