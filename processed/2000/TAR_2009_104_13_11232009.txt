Mayor Ravenstahl responds to fair share tax controversy, ICAs unanimous rejection
Calls tuition tax an unfair .but necessary action
COURTNEY WinEKIND
Assistant News Editor 
MICHAEL R. FITZGERALD
Staffwriter
The debate over Mayor 
Ravenstahls proposed fair 
share tuition tax plan con
tinued in earnest last week. 
Amid national press coverage 
and growing outrage in cam
pus communities, lawmakers, 
administrators, and lawyers 
began gearing up for a Decem
ber showdown.
We will not rely on the 
revenue [produced from the 
tax] for 2010, Ravenstahl 
told The Tartan at his office 
last Thursday. We can bandaid it together.... At the end 
of 2010, though, weve got 
a very serious decision [to] 
make. We either need to find 
$15 million, or these cuts will 
happen. If they dont hap
pen, the city will go bankrupt. 
The black eye that Pittsburgh 
would receive, or the draco
nian cuts we would have to 
make ... would not be a good 
thing for the institutions that 
reside within it.
The comments came in the 
wake of the Intergovernmen
tal Cooperation Authoritys 
(ICA) rejection of his tax. The 
ICAs unanimous rejection of 
the budget on Wednesday en
sured that the mayor would 
have to deliver a revised bud
get by Dec. 31.
His new proposal could not 
rely on the tuition tax for rev
enue in 2010; otherwise, the 
city could face state seizure of 
its funds.
Despite the ICA rejection, 
city council members Ricky 
Burgess, Darlene Harris, Jim 
Motznik, Tonya Payne, and 
Theresa Smith stood by the 
mayor at a Thursday press 
conference. I think that our 
educational institutions have 
to participate, Burgess told 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
They have to support our city, 
and to participate in funding 
the services that are given to 
all of our constituents, includ
ing their students.
The mayor has also hired 
Joseph C. Bright, former chief 
counsel to the state Depart
ment of Revenue, to add heft 
to its argument that a 1 per
cent levy on tuition is legal, 
according to a Post-Gazette 
article last Wednesday. Mr.
Bright claims the city will win 
the court battle to get the tax 
on the books for 2011, due to 
a state law that gives munici
palities power to tax broadly 
defined privileges.
Post-secondary education 
administrators in Pittsburgh 
and nationwide continued to 
pile on criticism of the tax.

Between 10 and 15 busi
nesses are launched out of 
Carnegie Mellon each year, 
nearly half started entirely by 
students. This statistic was an
nounced by Art Boni, the di
rector of the Donald H. Jones 
Center for Entrepreneurship 
at Carnegie Mellon at Start
ing a Company as a Student 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity, an alumni panel held on 
Wednesday night. Boni has 
published numerous papers 
about entrepreneurship, with 
one of his most recent titled: 
Innovation in an Academic 
Setting, which is precisely 
what Wednesdays panel was 
about. This was one of the six 
events held Nov. 16-20 that
Carnegie Mellon hosted as 
part of Global Entrepreneur
ship Week. The events were 
sponsored by a variety of de
partments, clubs, and schools 
of Carnegie Mellon.
The week kicked off on 
Monday with an Entrepre
neurship and Innovation Net
work Night. In the four years 
I have been at Carnegie Mel
lon, this was the first event I 
have been to at the university 
that allowed undergraduate 
and MBA students to network 
and exchange ideas, Lauren 
McMicken, a senior econom
ics major who attended the 
event said. I was surprised 
how many students I met that 
had already started compa
nies and were working on 
their next big project. Every
one I met was really excited to
tell me their ideas and to hear 
about mine.
Other events during the 
week included a 90-second 
elevator pitch competition, 
an alumni panel about start
ing a company as a Carnegie 
Mellon student, and a faculty 
panel about commercializing 
next-generation technologies 
at the university, along with 
a social entrepreneurship and 
innovation lecture, a mixer, 
and a mini job fair.
Wednesdays alumni panel 
was moderated by Steve Fleck 
(MBA 04), the chief technol
ogy officer and co-founder 
of ClearCount Medical Solu
tions Inc., which Fleck started 
while he was getting his MBA

Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellons Robotics Institute 
have converted a 2001 Scion 
xB into an electric commuter 
vehicle that will serve as a 
test bed for a new communi
ty-based approach to electric 
vehicle design, conversion, 
and operations.
The vehicle is part of a new 
research project, ChargeCar, 
headed by Illah Nourbakhsh, 
associate professor of robot
ics. The project is exploring 
how electric vehicles can be 
customized to cost-effectively meet an individuals 
specific commuting needs. 
It was made possible when a 
philanthropic alumna, Don
na Auguste (Ph.D 83), pro
vided a grant to the CREATE 
Lab headed by Nourbakhsh 
to study ways to achieve high 
efficiency in electric vehicle 
power systems by incorporat
ing a supercapacitor.
The ChargeCar team includes three students: senior 
computer science major Vibhav Sreekanti, senior infor
mation systems major Paul 
Dille, and SHS junior Matt 
Duescher. Also on the team 
are co-principal investigator 
Gregg Podnar, research en
gineer Josh Schapiro, senior 
research programmer Chris 
Bartley, project scientist Ben 
Brown, and Intel Labs Pitts
burgh senior researcher Ja
son Campbell.
Most electric cars today 
are being designed with topdown engineering to match 
the performance of gas-pow
ered cars, Nourbakhsh said. 
Our goal is to revolutionize 
urban commuting by taking a 
different approach  by first 
analyzing the needs, condi
tions, and habits of the daily 
commutes of actual people 
and then using this commute 
ecology to develop electric 
vehicles suited to each unique 
commute. The researchers

Carnegie Mellon spent 
One Week on Death Row 
last week as our Amnesty 
International (AI) chapter 
hosted three days of events 
that encouraged the cam
pus community to discuss 
their opinions on the death 
penalty.
Amnesty International 
is an international organi
zation dedicated to under
taking research and action 
in order to prevent human 
rights abuses. The organi
zation now has more than 
2.2 million members, sup
porters, and subscribers in 
over 150 countries and ter
ritories, in every region of 
the world.
Amnesty International 
on Carnegie Mellons cam
pus is specifically focused 
on abolishing the death 
penalty and informing the 
campus community of the 
complexities and realities 
of the death penalty in the 
United States.
This is our first time 
hosting this event and we 
want to provide an unbiased 
space for people to learn 
and talk about the death 
penalty, the president of 
Amnesty International, 
Amy Badiani, a junior glob
al politics and policy man
agement major said. An
other member of Amnesty 
International agreed with 
Badiani. We dont want to 
enforce views on the cam
pus. These events are to 
welcome an open conversa
tion, Aneesh Bhoopathy, a 
first-year cognitive science 
major, said.
The first event was a 
death penalty debate. Par
ticipants were given a list 
of arguments for each side 
to aid them, but they were 
also able to make their own 
claims.
The board members 
asked numerous questions 
to the group like, Does the 
death penalty constitute 
cruel and unusual pun
ishment?^ and Is life in 
^prison an alternative to the 
death penalty? It started 
as a structured debate but 
turned into more of an open 
forum, allowing partici
pants to ask questions while 
defending their positions.
The second event was 
more focused on educating 
participants on the injustice 
of the death penalty. Board 
members explained the 
historical opposition to the 
death penalty and stated 
that Amnesty International 
refers to the death penalty 
as the ultimate denial of 
human rights.
After the presenta
tion, guest speaker Mar
tha Conley, Chairperson of 
the Pittsburgh chapter of 
Pennsylvanians Against the 
Death Penalty (PADP), dis
cussed the injustice of the 
death penalty.
Conley cited many cases 
in which innocent people 
were sent to jail or even ex
ecuted because they were 
not able to fight the system. 
Innocent people dont take 
plea bargains, because they 
cant imagine theyll be con
victed, Conley said. They 
dont understand how high 
the justice system is stacked 
against them.
She feels that the num
ber of innocent people 
who are put on death row 
is alarming and that there 
are some consistent fac
tors that cause these people 
to be sentenced to death, 
such as police and judicial

University holds toy drive, CNBC special
CIT sponsors Toys for Tots CNBC Meeting of the Minds
Walking by the Univer
sity Center last Monday, one 
might have seen a World War
II memorial. Carnegie Mellon 
first-year CIT students began 
their fourth annual U.S. Ma
rine Corps Toys for Tots drive 
there from noon to 3 p.m.
The program was started 
by the College of Engineering 
First Year Advisory Board and 
raises money for toys for chil
dren. Anyone in the campus 
community is encouraged 
to donate in centers located 
throughout campus, and all 
toys should be in unwrapped 
and new condition. Locations 
include Student Activities, 
Student Life, Housing and 
Dining, CIT, and the Mellon 
Institute, among others.
The memorial highlighted 
an airplane repair hut, field
hospital, and the role of dogs 
in security in the military. 
WWII veteran alumni were 
present, as well as Dan Ham
ilton of Pittsburgh for the me
morial.
The program came to 
a close with the release of 
a dove and the playing of 
Amazing Grace. Students 
were able to collect more 
than $1000 worth of dona
tions and toys last year in this 
beneficial service learning 
project.
Toys for Tots originated in 
1947 as a pilot project when 
Marine Major Bill Hendricks, 
along with other reservists, 
donated 5000 toys to chil
dren in need. The program 
was such a success that the 
Marines made it a nationwide 
campaign in 1948.
CNBCs Maria Bartiromo 
will host an hour-long Meet
ing of the Minds special at 
6:30 p.m. today in Wiegand 
Gym. For this one-hour spe
cial event, CNBC will bring 
together decision makers, 
business leaders, policy mak
ers, and visionaries. Panel
ists include Bill Ford, execu
tive chairman of Ford Motor 
Company; Daniel R. DiMicco, 
chairman, president, and CEO 
of Nucor Corporation; Leo W. 
Gerard, international presi
dent of United Steelworkers; 
Jeff Immelt, chairman and 
CEO of General Electric; John 
Engler, president and CEO of 
the National Association of 
Manufacturers; and Hilda 
Solis, U.S. Secretary of Labor 
for a qualitative discussion on 
the future of manufacturing.
CNBCs Meeting of the 
Minds series has explored 
some of the biggest issues 
raised by this new economic 
reality, including capitalism 
and healthcare, said Susan 
Krakower, senior vice presi
dent for strategic program
ming and development $t 
CNBC.
And now, CNBC gathers 
some of the countrys most 
influential leaders to take on 
manufacturing, an industry 
that is a prized part of our 
economic history, whose fu
ture is now in question.

Universities nationwide react to Pittsburghs higher-education tax
your institutions, said Ravenstahl. Both measures would 
require changes to state legis
lation, which the mayor said 
he has pursued unsuccessfully 
for some time.
I dont disagree that 
theres not a level of unfair
ness to this [tuition] tax, he 
said, adding that, at the same 
time, city residents unfairly 
shoulder the burden of paying 
for city services. He claimed 
that his inability to extract 
more funds from commuters 
and non-profit institutions has 
forced him to target students 
wallets.
Students spoke out against 
the tax Friday, when 50 stu
dents attended a city council 
meeting downtown. Four stu
dents spoke at the meeting, 
their first opportunity to en
gage Pittsburghs lawmakers. 
Students have also set up a 
website at www.stoptuitiontax.org to organize their oppo- > 
sition, and many plan to attend 
city councils public meeting 
about the tax on Nov. 30.
The citys current bud
getary problems  the result 
of over 60 years of financial 
mismanagement  should 
not be placed on the backs of 
students working hard to bet
ter themselves, said Student 
Body President Rotimi Abimbola, Student Senate Chair 
Aaron Gross, and Graduate 
Student Assembly President 
Patrick Gage Kelley in a formal 
e-mail statement of opposition 
last Thursday.
How many consultants 
hired by the city have to tell 
the Mayor to cut or reduce
underutilized services, before 
he stands up to city workers 
unions? Just because were not 
a strong voting bloc doesnt 
mean he should get away with 
not pursuing other obvious 
solutions, Erin Burns, a se
nior anthropology major and 
resident of the city said. Not 
to mention the fact CMUs 
10,000 students would pay the 
most of any college under this 
tax. Wheres the proof that we 
consume more services than 
the 50,000 other students in 
the city? Burns said.
As the controversy around 
the tax has grown, the city has 
attracted nationwide atten
tion. USA Today covered the 
tuition tax last week, as did 
the national higher-education 
periodical Inside Higher Ed. 
The Inside Higher Ed article 
described recent attempts to 
tax revenues from higher-ed
ucation institutions in Boston, 
Providence, and Berkeley. M. 
Matthew Owens, an associate 
vice president for federal re
lations for the Association of 
American Universities (AAU) 
warned 62 member institu
tions about 18 months ago of 
the coming wave of munici
palities looking to tax higher 
education.
This topic across the coun
try is quietly brewing in uni
versity and college towns.... 
All eyes are on Pittsburgh to 
see how they handle this and 
whether it works, said Kim 
Griffo, the director of the 
Clemson University-based In
ternational Town and Gown 
Association, in Inside Higher 
Ed.
Courtney Wittekind/Assistant News Editor
Ravenstahl tells student reporters that studying in Pittsburgh is one of the privileges that will be taxed if the mayor's proposed budget is passed.
RAVENSTAHL, from A1
Jared Cohon made his first 
public statement concerning 
the tax Friday. He listed Car
negie Mellons more than $1.4 
million paid in taxes, fees, 
and services to the city annu
ally and the more than 15,000
jobs the university creates as 
examples of the universitys 
contributions.
At a time when Pittsburgh 
is trying to attract and retain 
young people, it should not 
become known as the only city 
in the UkS. to impose what is 
being called a privilege tax on
its students, Cohon said. Ra
venstahl told The Tartan that 
studying in Pittsburgh was one 
example of the privileges the 
city will tax.Its what were al
lowed to do, to act locally, and 
its that reason and that reason 
alone, Ravenstahl said in re
sponse to a question about his
framing of higher education in 
Pittsburgh as a privilege.
If given the choice, there 
would be at least two options 
I would pursue: the $52 tax 
being raised to $144 on any
one who works in Pittsburgh; 
 the second would be raising 
the payroll preparations tax to

reveals that once a victims

of the victim and the ac

legal process: from how a

In the documentary, 
family members, reporters, 
and the inmates share their 
opinions on how race did or 
did not influence the cases.
The movie was really

the data we collect, we hope 
to build algorithms to tailor 
solutions to individual com

By customizing each ve

commute, ChargeCar will 
save money for some owners 
by allowing them to purchase 
the minimum number of bat
teries necessary. The num
ber one cost of electric vehicle 
ownership is the batteries, 
Nourbakhsh said. Smart 
power management will save 
money initially because it 
pairs a low-cost battery pack 
with a small supercapacitor. 
And it will continue to save 
money by increasing effi
ciency and extending battery 
life.
Podnar developed the 
high-level designs of the con
version of the Scion xB, se-^_ *lected the motors, controllers, 
and energy storage system, 
and designed the power con
trol system. The supercapaci
tor is efficient at supplying 
high currents on acceleration 
and accepting high currents
when regeneratively braking. 
By off-loading the battery 
from these high currents, we 
get more of the stored energy 
from the battery, we recover 
more energy when regenera
tively braking so we can use it 
for longer range, and the bat
tery will last longer, Podnar 
said.
Researchers also devel
oped predictive energy man
agement. By looking ahead 
we can predict the energy 
needs of the next segment of 
travel. If it is going to be down
hill or approaching a stop sign, 
we want the supercapacitor to 
start fully discharged. If we 
are about to climb a hill or ac
celerate from a stop, we will 
want the supercapacitor fully 
charged, Podner said.
The converted Scion xB 
will be a testing ground for 
developing smart power-management techniques, measur

Sleeping helps memory storage
In a new study published in Science, researchers from North
western University indicated that sleeping is an important aid 
in memory development. This is different from the strategy of 
learning in ones sleep, which has been generally disproven in 
scientific studies. Participants were told to remember the loca
tion of 50 separate objects on a screen, each accompanied by a 
sound. Those who took naps shortly after learning were better 
able to recall the association than the control group which did 
not nap. The sleeping group had the sound linked to the associa
tion played to them while asleep.
While the study provides interesting results, it raises more 
questions than it resolves. Applications such as studying while 
listening to music and then listening to the music while sleep
ing are intriguing, but John Rudoy, the author of the paper, ex
plained that more work is needed.

California limits television energy usage
This past Wednesday, California became the first state in the 
nation to impose limits on how much energy television sets can 
consume. The new California Energy Commission regulation 
aims to reduce TV power drain by 33 percent by 2011 and 50 
percent by 2013. The rules apply to all televisions sold in Califor
nia except those larger than 58 inches. Because California repre
sents such a large segment of consumers, these regulations will 
have widespread effects.
With flat-screen sets replacing older cathode ray tube televi
sions, the energy drain has increased in recent years and is esti
mated at 10 percent of household electricity usage in California. 
Environmental advocates hope that the reduction in television 
energy consumption, along with other energy reforms, will re
duce carbon dioxide emissions by 3 million metric tons in the 
next 10 years.

Mammogram report creates controversy
A report released Monday by the U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force, an independent company, stating that women should 
not get routine mammograms until age 50 has come under fire 
over the past week. The report justifies its decision not to recom
mend screenings between age 40 and 50 by claiming that false 
positives cause unnecessary stress given the number of actual 
positive cases.
A number of organizations have opposed the report, saying 
that traditional recommendations of regular mammograms af
ter age 40 are important for early detection of breast cancer. The 
American Cancer Society and the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) both opposed the findings. HHS 
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and the White House noted that the 
report does not reflect government policy and that government 
programs will continue to support regular screenings.

The Starship Enterprise of 
Star Trek fame has been sail
ing through the Final Frontier 
for years.
Today it is hard to imagine 
a source of enough energy to 
keep a ship operating at warp 
drive so effortlessly. Living in 
the age of fossil fuels severely 
restricts our attempts at boldly 
going out into space.
There have been numerous 
proposals of alternate propul
sion schemes over the years, 
but the most notable of the 
various ideas is that of the so
lar sail. Solar sails use light to 
propel spacecraft.
Light is made up of a num
ber of particles called photons. 
Each of these photons has an 
associated momentum. Just 
as two colliding marbles ex
change momentum, a photon 
is capable of transferring some 
of its momentum to any object 
it may collide with. This trans
fer of momentum is maxi
mized when photons bounce 
off the body, in a well-known 
phenomenon called reflec
tion.
A single photon, or even a 
large stream of photons, pro
duces no perceptible accelera
tion to a body of a macroscopic 
size on Earth. This is why we 
do not feel the constant bom
bardment of photons from ev
ery light source around us. In 
the vacuum of space, however, 
there is no resistance offered 
by gases, and while still not 
perceptibly larger, there is an 
increase in the amount of force 
photons exert on a body.
Naturally, a body with a 
large surface area for the pho
tons to bounce off will experi
ence a larger force. Further
more, if the body is lighter, 
according to Newtons Second 
Law, it will be accelerated fast
er. This is the basic concept be
hind the use of solar sails.
Solar sails are sheets of 
mirror-like materials that are 
made such that they are ex
tremely light and have as large 
a surface area as is permissible 
by their weight constraints.
These sails are attached

Competition promotes innovations in researchHEALTH. TALK............. ...............HPV: A virus as diverse as the species it infects

Research projects of students from six regions in the United States were showcased at Carnegie Mellon, which hosted the Siemens Competition last 
weekend. This competition hopes to promote innovations in many fields of study.

Last weekend, Carnegie 
Mellon hosted the Siemens

petition that brings together 
brilliant high school students 
from across the country.
Funded by the Siemens 
Foundation and overseen by 
the College Board, the Sie
mens Competition was cre
ated in 1997 to promote inno
vations in the fields of math, 
science, technology, and engi
neering.
Students from six regions 
in the United States have the 
opportunity to work individu
ally or with a group (usually 
an accredited university) on a 
project of their choosing.
Carnegie Mellon was re
sponsible for hosting the Sec
tion Four regional finalists this 
weekend.
On Friday, the 25 winning 
students showcased their pre
sentations in Rangos Hall for 
family, friends, judges, profes
sors, students, and everyday 
citizens to view.
The teams stood by their
posters outlining their meth
ods and conclusions in solving 
various problems.
Noted speakers at the event 
included Eric Grotzinger, Mel
lon College of Sciences asso
ciate dean for undergraduate 
affairs; Jim Whaley, the Sie

and Chuck Gordon, CEO and 
president of Siemens Corpo

They praised the students 
for the contributions to re

The need for innovation 
has never been greater, Gordon said. The next step in 
these students journey is the

 doctors discovered that 
Dede had a rare form of a hu
man papillomavirus, or HPV, 
an infection of the skin.
Human papillomavirus 
infections are caused by a 
papillomavirus, a virus that 
can enter the body through 
cuts and other small wounds, 
called microtraumas.
Due to the mechanism 
with which the virus repli
cates, it can only infect body 
surface tissues, such as the 
skin or the outer layers of the 
mouth. Once inside the body, 
the virus replicates its DNA in 
host cells, after which causes 
the host cell to die, releasing 
more virus material. The pro
cess is then repeated, multi
plying the number of viruses 
quickly.
HPV may be commonly
thought of as a sexually trans
mitted infection, but this is 
not necessarily the case.
There are over one hun
dred types of human papil
lomaviruses that have been 
identified, which are classi
fied numerically.
Different types infect spe
cific parts of the body, caus
ing specific reactions. Some 
are benign and asymptomatic 
while others can cause warts; 
certain types of HPV can even 
cause cancer.
There are proteins in the 
body that usually function to 
suppress tumor formation, 
but the cancer-causing papil
lomaviruses have the ability 
to inactivate these.
While HPV would be the 
cause of Koswaras warts, 
there is an underlying genetic 
reason as to why his condi
tion spun out of control.
Koswara has a recessive 
genetic disorder known as 
epidermodysplasia verruci
formis, which is character
ized in part by an increased 
susceptibility to HPV. The 
few who have had this disor
der have been distinguished 
by the abnormal quantity and 
size of warts that grow on 
their hands and feet.
Warts will also grow on 
the rest of their body, includ
ing their head, but with less 
intensity and frequency than 
those on their limbs.
Currently, the cause for 
this genetic disorder is un
known, but the specific genes 
that are mutated have been 
located. Researchers propose 
that the genes affected are 
responsible for proper zinc 
distribution inside cells.

Republican leaders embody stereotypes
With the release of Sarah Palins autobiography, Going Rogue: 
An American Life, and her daughterturned-teenage-mothers ex-boy
friends naked photos in Playgirl last 
week, the Republican Party has a lot 
to worry about.
In the months following her failed 
campaign for the Presidency, Palin 
has turned the loss into a he said,

are seemingly dominated by cropped

China was, for the most part, hardly 
worth mentioning. You might expect 
a meeting between two of the worlds 
most powerful countries to result in 
statements that shape global policy. 
Nothing like that happened this 
time, at least not according to the 
U.S. media.
But while American media and 
Washingtons ambassador to Bei
jing, Jon Huntsman, continue fight
ing about what actually occurred in 
meetings with the Chinese adminis

While in China, Obama was able 
to speak to a group of four hundred 
specially selected Chinese students.

motes her 413-page autobiography, 
she is deliberately skipping certain 
cities in which she was unpopular 
during the 2008 Presidential cam
paign, such as Washington, D.C. and 
New York. While Palin constantly at
tributes her (seemingly unending) 
negative portrayal in the news to the 
media, she reduces herself to a cari
cature, thereby reducing the Repub
lican Party to a caricature of itself.
Not only is Palin an embarrass

(and her familys) exploitation of the 
political stage is embarrassing. From 
Palins book (in which she overzealously uses exclamation points and 
calls reports that paint her in an unTo an audience described as docile by 
ABC News, Obama talked about the 
future of the China-U.S. relationship, 
openness, and freedom of expression 
and religion. The students shot back 
with hard-hitting questions like: 
Why did you get that Nobel Prize? 
According to reports, students 
left the room thinking Obama was an 
enjoyable and friendly man whose 
solutions might not work in China. 
Possibly, this reflects more upon the 
attitudes of the students chosen by 
party and university leadership to 
be present, or maybe this is part of 
a larger trend, with the intellectual 
youth of China believing they need 
to find their own ways to progress as

being reduced to a superficial shell of

Reducing political parties to their

of the Palin plague is that these neg

that Obama ran on, led by commu

was originally intended to be tele

on local Shanghai stations and at 
watch parties around China, al
though the entire transcript is now 
available online.
So as America discusses at length 
whether Obama pushed hard enough 
regarding nuclear waste and Iran, 
we here at The Tartan are consider
ing these four hundred students who 
heard our President speak. It is their 
voices that will be directing the fu
ture of China.
Whenever one hears about In
ternet crime, one usually pictures 
a case of identity theft, fund em
bezzlement, or stalking. In a recent 
arrest of several California youths, 
however, all three of these crimes 
were combined in a bizarre affair 
involving the burglaries of several 
Hollywood celebrities houses.
A group of six young adults, chris
tened by newspapers and entertain
ment websites as The Bling Ring, 
and ranging from ages 18 to 27, have 
been stealing jewelry, clothing, and 
other celebrity memorabilia from 
residences in the suburbs of Los An
geles. Victimized celebrities include 
Lindsey Lohan, Paris Hilton, and Or
lando Bloom.
The real stroke of genius of the 
Bling Ring is the way they orches
trated these burglaries. By check
ing websites such as TMZ.com and 
MySpace, they could check the 
daily schedules of these celebrities 
and even their addresses. The Ring 
could then coordinate the timing of 
the thefts with when the celebs said 
that they would be out of the house.
The thefts have not been mild. In 
a search of one of the members of 
the Rings houses, police found over 
$20,000, designer jeans, and photo
graphs of Hilton, all suspected to be 
taken from the socialites home. The 
Ring was able to return about three 
or four times before they were tar
geted by the LAPD.
The sheer resourcefulness of the 
kids amazes me, especially since it 
was not an overly elaborate crime. 
All it took was a few clicks of a
I used to babysit my cousin in 
high school. When I would reject 
his propositions, he would get mad 
at me, put his hands in his ears, and 
shout so that he couldnt hear me. 
Eventually, I realized that you just 
cant rationalize with a 5-year-old.
I recently came to a similar re
alization when the people of Pitts
burgh re-elected Luke Ravenstahl as 
mayor, as he approaches the citys 
problems with the rationalizing ca
pability of a 5-year-old.
Recently, Ravenstahl proposed 
a 1 percent tax on the tuition of all 
students enrolled in post-secondary 
institutions. The mayor has met with 
opposition to this tax from the Pitts
burgh Council on Higher Education, 
college administrators, students, 
and Pennsylvania state representa
tives. The tax has been unanimously 
rejected by the Intergovernmental 
Cooperation Authority  a group 
that discussed the legitimacy of the 
tax and Ravenstahls proposed bud
get  yet he is still pursuing it.
I recently sent a letter to the Pitts
burgh city council members to show 
my opposition to the tax. In the let
ter, I described the tax as a violation 
of both common sense and econom
ics. I explained that if Ravenstahl 
had taken a course on economics 
and paid any attention in class, he 
would be familiar with the concept 
of negative externalities and posi
tive externalities. Negative extermouse, a map, and a car. Were so 
used to living in the digital age and 
loving all of the services it has to of
fer, but when drawbacks like these 
hit, they hit hard.
A more pressing issue, however, 
is the fact that the information was 
on these social networking sites to 
begin with. With the recent upsurge 
in popularity of self-promoting web
sites like MySpace, Facebook, and 
Twitter, people are finding it easier 
to give a brief vignette on how they 
feel, what theyre doing, or where 
theyre going, but youd think that 
these same people  especially ce
lebrities who probably have more 
followers on Twitter than I do skin 
cells  would know better than to 
put their personal info up in great 
detail where anyone can see it. Sure, 
its nice to hear about the latest ce
lebrity scandal purely to indulge 
in some healthy schadenfreude, 
but details like your in-depth daily 
schedule are best kept to yourself.
As for the kids involved, you may 
think to yourself: Is this the work of 
fanatic stalkers? Or some troubled 
rich teens with too much time on 
their hands? Considering it was 
clothing that was stolen, one would 
probably be more apt to believe the 
stalker theory. But when you con
sider the clothing and accessory 
budgets of some of these celebri
ties, it could have been a stylistic or 
financial move on the Rings part. 
And what else are a bunch of teens 
going to do in a celebrity-rich neigh
borhood of California on a Saturday 
night?
Opportunity and boredom: What 
a winning combination.

nalities occur when an individual or 
organization makes a decision for 
which they do not pay the full cost, 
due to the fact that their decision is 
bringing about negative and expen
sive effects. These should be taxed 
so that the producers pay to make up 
for the deadweight loss created by 
the product. Ravenstahl has painted 
college students as negative exter
nalities, claiming that by being in 
this region, we are freeloaders.
This is where his economics fal
ter. Most students contribute taxes 
and pay for Port Authority in our 
tuition. And what would this city be 
without its post-secondary institu
tions? Probably something like De
troit. We give the city the prestige to 
have anything happen here besides 
a football or hockey match.
Imagine this city without a single 
post-secondary institution. Busi
nesses that were started by gradu
ates would be gone; the community 
service that students do for the city 
would no longer exist. In one school 
year alone, Carnegie Mellon stu
dents amassed 80,000 hours of com
munity service. It is clear that we are 
a positive externality, not a negative 
one.
I hope that in making the bud
get decision, Ravenstahl keeps 
money on his mind as well as solid 
economic analysis to make his deci
sions. The least I ask of Ravenstahl 
is to grow up, take his hands out of 
his ears, and assess the current situ
ation rationally to come up with an 
appropriate solution.

New technology allows for robotic passengers
Imagine that youre speeding 
down the highway in your Audi, 
windows rolled down, radio cranked 
up so that you can barely even hear 
yourself singing along to the familiar 
tunes. And whos that next to you, 
harmonizing? Thats just Aida, your 
robotic passenger.
Aida, or the Affective Intelligent 
Driving Agent, is a robot designed by 
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology (MIT) that is meant to sit in 
the passenger seat of the car and 
help improve peoples driving habits, 
according to Wired magazine. Aida, 
according to the article, is meant to
make people safer and happier driv
ers by analyzing their driving habits, 
tracking frequent routes, providing 
real-time traffic information, and 
making friendly suggestions about 
buckling up and following the speed 
limit.
MIT researchers explain in the ar
ticle that having Aida in the car will 
actually help drivers skills because 
the robot will act as a passenger  
facial expressions and all  which 
studies have found improves peoples 
driving.
Its impressive to see new and in
novative uses of the constantly evolv
ing technology of current times, es
pecially ones that are designed to 
improve the safety of people on the 
road, as opposed to the cell-phone 
calls and texting that currently only 
distract drivers. Its also impressive 
that Audi is partnering with the MIT 
labs to turn this research into reality 
instead of relegating the robot to the 
labs of universities.
We look forward to the day when 
we can drive in a tricked-out Audi 
with Aida riding shotgun, intermit
tently directing us where to turn 
as we chat about the weather and 
whats happening in the world.

Looking at a different kind of science fiction: 
Portrait of a call girl as a scientific researcher
LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVES
SBVPF launches 
many initiatives
Belle de Jour is your typical 
high-class London call girl: blonde, 
sophisticated, and... in possession 
of a Ph.D.? The blonde bombshell 
and great literary mystery recently 
revealed herself to be Dr. Brooke 
Magnanti, developmental neurotoxologist, cancer epidemiologist, 
and apparent literary figure. We 
now know the real Belle de Jour, the 
pseudonym that spawned the book 
Secret Diary of a London Call Girl, 
which spawned the eponymous TV 
series.
Ever seen the TV series? Im 
very high-class, British actress Billie 
Piper says breathily, which means 
I charge by the hour. And I charge a 
lot. The hotel elevator doors close in 
on a busty Belle headed for a clients 
penthouse. Escort, hooker, prosti
tute, whore... I dont mind what you 
call me. Thats just semantics. The 
trailer flashes to Belle wearing only 
balloons, Belle in bed with two other 
girls, Belle pulling up black stockings. 
How did an aspiring neurotoxologist 
get herself into this bind?
It turns out the then-Ph.D. student 
ran out of money in the final months 
of completing her dissertation and 
turned to a quick-fix job that doesnt 
require much training or skill.
For 14 months, the soon-to-be Dr. 
Magnanti worked as a call girl and 
documented her adventures in what 
some consider to be quite excellent 
literary form.
Her recent revelation went viral, 
from criticisms about glamorizing 
prostitution to praising her openness 
about the situation. In an interview 
with New Scientist, Brooke explained
that getting that extra cash allowed 
her to pursue science rather than 
change careers. She also touched on 
the underpaid status of Ph.D. stu
dents.
As someone who aspires to go to 
graduate school, this got me wor
ried. I was going to be that under
paid, underappreciated, overworked 
graduate student. Whats an ambi
tious student to do under the current 
educational system? I investigated 
both sides.
To Belles proponents, or those 
who will refer back to her situation 
when the dissertation is unfinished 
and the bank is empty, here are two 
reasons why Ph.D. students should 
not double as call girls, hookers, es
corts, or whatever the semantics may 
be:
In the TV series, Belle advocates 
that one should keep life and job 
separate. Hannah, Piper says, mo
tioning to a rack of business casual. 
Belle, she says, motioning to a rack 
of negligees and black lacy things. 
Never the two shall meet.
I would hate the hassle of sepa
rating laundry into even more piles: 
light-colored normal clothes, darkcolored normal clothes, devilishcolored lingerie, and your presumed 
white lab coats. Clearly, having two 
identities escalates the amount of 
effort it takes to do laundry. You 
wouldnt want those see-through 
panties to accidentally end up in the 
pockets of your metaphorical white 
lab coats.
It probably isnt so glamorous. To 
state the obvious: Magnanti is smart
er than your average hooker. Though 
she does get prestigious penthouse 
clients, servicing those with less  
ahem  experience, and probably 
n = 0 PubMed citations isnt exactly 
the scientific fantasy.
To Belles critics, who argue that 
her past is shameful, that she is ruSiiit;::;:?!!?!!!;:
,|3PMIKfSiStSSSSKM
illpiiiiipp:
   Stfl
V " :
ining the collective reputation of 
higher education, and that there are 
much better options to get through a 
tight time, well, there are two jobs Id 
consider to be lower than a prostitute 
or whore, whatever the semantics 
may be:
Whoever the idiot was that 
thought of imposing a 1 percent tu
ition tax on the citys colleges, fur
ther ingratiating the financial strain 
of students... a.k.a. the mayor of 
Pittsburgh.
Hannah Gordon/Art Staff
Whoever thought about support
ing it. The financial situation of stu
dents is dire as is. Are they working 
to perpetuate more situations like 
Belles?
Finally, to Dr. Magnanti, for using 
her newfound fame to promote her 
current research on how pesticide 
exposures cause neurodevelopmental disorders: Brava, Belle, brava.

Adding of unfriend to dictionary reveals insecurity
Last week heralded a new age in 
the evolution of our dear Facebook. 
No, there wasnt another newsfeed 
redesign or privacy update? In fact, 
Mark Zuckerberg and friends werent 
even involved in this change.
On Tuesday, the publishers of the 
Oxford English Dictionary decided 
that unfriend was their word of the 
year for 2009. In case you are one of 
the five students on campus without 
a Facebook account, or in case you 
always keep every single one of your 
Facebook friends, I give you the new 
official definition:
Unfriend  verb  To remove 
someone as a friend on a social net
working site such as Facebook. 
Eloquent, dont you think?
The past week has shown the 
word of the year to be controversial. 
Across the Internet, bloggers have 
decried this outrage. Columnists 
have challenged the validity of un friend, claiming that terms such as 
defriend are much more popular. 
While I admire these protesters, I feel 
that they do not address the deeper 
issues at stake.
I personally take umbrage with
this neologism for a multitude of rea
sons.
For one thing, unfriend isnt 
even a new word. According to the 
Oxford English Dictionary, it was used 
in print in 1659, and even back then 
people were worried that a Differ
ence which hath happened betwixt 
them might cause them to be mutu
ally Unfriended.
Aside from the fact that the word 
of the year for 2009 seems to be 350 
years old, it seems a bit premature to 
assign a word to a year in the middle 
of November. Do people stop using 
language" after Thanksgiving? If it 
turns out that the 2012 apocalypse 
happens slightly sooner than antici
pated and is instead this December, 
I think that unfriend might be a 
little weak to describe the end of the 
world.
As if their sense of timing werent 
bad enough, half of the board mem
bers probably dont have Facebook 
accounts. They dont understand 
that unfriending someone, as they 
so officially put it, is an emotional 
and personal decision. By giving an 
official definition to this difficult pro
cess, Oxford University Press has lim
ited our ability to define ourselves.
Facebook encourages us to share 
our inner souls with the entire population of the Internet, all of whom 
care deeply about what we are eating 
for lunch today and how much home
work we have due tomorrow. It helps 
us to expand out of our social bub
bles by suggesting new friends that, 
Ive found, end up being people Ive 
always been missing in my life. It re
minds us to post on our friends walls 
when its been too long (according to 
some brilliant algorithm, no doubt). 
And lets not forget the most impor
tant use of Facebook  advertising 
new relationships or the fact that 
were looking for one. Its a wonder 
that civilization made it so long with
out this indispensable information 
source.
With its promotion of this new 
unfriend moniker, Oxford Univer
sity Press is not bringing a new word 
into the official lexicon. It is, in fact, 
working to undermine the very foun
dation of modern society. Where 
Facebook encourages us to find new 
friends, this organization seems in
stead focused on destroying social 
connections. Unfriend is just the 
latest in the Oxford dictionarys suc
cession of antisocial vocabulary, join
ing such pernicious terms as pugna
cious, acrimonious, donnybrook, and 
the ever-popular tetricity. Compare 
that to Tuesdays word of the day on
the socially responsible Urban Dic
tionary: Palintologist - A person 
thaf~ [sic] follows/studies political 
dinosaurs.T think the distinction is 
pretty clear.
Now, I can understand why Ox
ford University Press has chosen to 
set itself against the coming Face
book utopia. Books and newspapers 
are dying, and dictionaries have been 
on the way out for years. Logophiles 
are endangered, their only sources of 
comfort esoteric Scrabble boards (the 
ones that have no triple word scores 
but give extra points for diacritical 
marks). Its only natural to want to 
preserve ones own breed by sacrific
ing the greater good of society.
The decision of Oxford Univer
sity Press to choose unfriend over 
such attractive finalists as netbook 
and sexting is a desperate effort 
to maintain its so-called relevancy 
while fighting against social unity. 
Facebook should be a place for mak
ing friends, not losing them. Decades 
from now, when anthropologists 
look back at 2009,1 hope they do not 
characterize it the same divisive way 
as Oxford University Press.

NARA KASBERGEN
As your Student Body Vice 
President for Finance, my role is 
to oversee the spending of the 
revenue generated by the $92 per 
semester student activities fee that 
all students pay. This is primar
ily done by serving as chair of the 
Joint Funding Committee, which 
allocates yearly budgets for CoSOrecognized student organizations. 
This means that unless you are 
a student organization leader, 
my work is likely invisible to you. 
Therefore, Id like to briefly sum
marize my initiatives over the past 
semester.
In September, I passed a slate of 
amendments to the Student Body 
Constitution and Joint Funding 
Committee Bylaws, which were 
approved by the Undergraduate 
Student Senate and Graduate Stu
dent Assembly. The most signifi
cant changes included increasing 
the size of the JFC from 11 to a 
maximum of 17 students, adding 
attendance requirements to hold 
JFC members accountable for their 
responsibilities, and changing the 
JFC funding policy for groups split
ting off from existing student orga
nizations.
That same month, I launched 
a publicity campaign to recruit 
applicants for the JFC, which 
in previous years had consisted 
mostly of Senators and a few or
ganization leaders. This years 
17-member committee is arguably 
the most diverse JFC yet, with 13 
undergraduate and four graduate 
students representing all eight col
leges, all class levels, and varying 
ethnic backgrounds, campus in
volvement, and levels of Student 
Government experience.
The committee convened in 
October, and representatives were 
assigned to organizations shortly 
after. Unlike in previous years, 
JFC members have begun meeting 
with our groups in the fall to truly 
get to know the organizations we 
represent, though the budget pro
posal process does not begin until 
January. In addition to meeting 
with their executive boards, I have 
urged the representatives to attend 
their groups events and general 
body meetings.
In addition, one of the goals set 
forth by the Presidents Student 
Advisory Council is to encourage 
more collaboration among student 
organizations on campus. This 
has also been an area of focus for 
the JFC, both by encouraging the 
groups we are working with to hold 
joint events and by establishing a 
stronger relationship between our 
committee and CoSO.
If you have any questions about 
JFC, the funding process, or issues 
related to the Student Activities 
Fee, you can e-mail me anytime at 
sbt@ or stop by my office hours on 
Mondays from 4:30-5:30 p.m.
Have a good Thanksgiving, and 
good luck with finals.
Its almost time for Thanksgiving break! So we asked,

The Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity mens basketball team 
traveled to Wooster, Ohio, 
to compete in the College of 
Woosters A1 Van Wie/Rotary 
Tournament. The Tartans 
lost their game on Friday to 
Wooster 74-61 before pull
ing out a 72-65 win against 
Heidelberg College on Sat
urday. The Tartans record is 
now 1-2.
Trailing for the first half 
against Wooster, sophomore 
Joe Kromka played well as he 
hit a jumper with 1:05 on the 
clock. During the second half, 
the Tartans went on a sevenpoint run to try to catch up 
with 12:30 to play, but Woost
er responded with a sevenpoint run as well. The Tartans 
fought back at the end of the 
game, but Wooster was able 
to hold fast for the 13-point 
win.
Tartan senior Jack Ander
son contributed to the game, 
raking in 21 points, along 
with senior Jon Wolleben and 
sophomore John Duhring, 
each adding 10 points to the 
score.
First-year guard Christian 
Shepley, who played 24 min
utes during the game, was 
disappointed with the loss 
against Wooster: Unfortu
nately our team just made too 
many mistakes in the begin
ning of the game to be able 
to catch back up to Wooster

and give ourselves a chance to 
win, he said.
On Saturday, the mens 
team competed in the consola
tion game of the tournament 
again Heidelberg College. 
Junior Matt Pettit played a 
great game with a career-high 
28 points to the team, lead
ing the Tartans to the 72-65 
win. Carnegie Mellon trailed 
Heidelberg after the first half, 
29-34, but the Tartans were 
able to gain momentum dur
ing the second half and took a 
44-43 lead with 14:09 on the 
clock on Pettits layup. The 
Tartans and Heidelberg vol
leyed with the lead, tying the 
score four times during the 
second half. Pettit also raked 
in a team-high 11 rebounds.
Anderson also recorded a 
double-double for the mens 
team, earning 17 points and 
10 rebounds.
Pettit commented on the 
game yesterday, saying, It 
felt good to contribute to our 
teams win. I was definitely 
able to feed off our teams in
tensity in the second half and 
capitalize on it. However, this 
is just the beginning for us: 
We will continue to get better 
as a team.
The Tartans return home 
with their 19th annual Radisson Carnegie Mellon Invita
tional on Saturday with tipoff at 3 p.m. The Tartans will 
then play against either Hood 
College or Manhattanville 
College at 3 p.m. on Sunday.

The Bison did not let them off 
easy, going on a 10-4 run in 
the remaining minutes. The 
run proved too little too late, 
though, as Carnegie Mellon 
pulled out the 60-55 win.
Cortese led in scoring for 
both teams, tallying 16 points, 
including a perfect 8-8 per
formance from the free throw 
line. Peel recorded her first 
double-double with 13 points 
and a game-high of 13 re
bounds.
Despite a strong start of the 
season, Cortese noted that in 
order to continue on a streak 
of success, the team will 
need to keep its energy high 
and continue to learn how 
to respond to situations with 
more fluency on the court.
These thoughts carried 
over to the Tartans next game 
as they hosted their third an
nual UAA(OAC) Challenge 
this past weekend. The squad 
pulled out a 69-61 win over 
Marietta College on Friday 
night.
Carnegie Mellon started 
out a little slow as Marietta 
scored two quick baskets in 
the first 1:23 of play. Howev
er, the Tartans scored the next

utes left in the first half, the 
Cardinal and Gray had a 28-

the score down to 28-25. Cor
tese answered with a threepoint play, while sophomore 
Nicole Vacarella took a full 
court layout and a nailed a 
trey to end the half 36-25.
Marietta did not go down 
without a fight and came 
out strong for the beginning 
of the second half. The Pio
neers went on a 9-2 run, but 
Carnegie Mellon answered 
with eight straight points, ad
vancing the score to 46-34. 
Marietta first-year Brittany 
Metcalf started a 12-3 run, 
but it proved to be not enough 
as the Tartans made seven of 
eight free throws to seal the 
deal with a 69-61 win.
Cortese lead the way with 
a double-double, scoring 24 
points and pulling down 10 
rebounds. Fifth-year senior

the score at 42-42. After the 
teams exchanged buckets, 
sophomore Jen Larsen hit a 
trey to take the lead to 47-46. 
The Cardinal and Gray did not 
give up their lead for the rest 
of the game, ending with a 
75-69 victory.
Coach Gerri Seidl previ
ously reflected on this sea
sons team: The 09-10
squad is athletic. A healthy 
full squad gives us the ability 
to go deeper into the bench. 
We have a little more versatil
ity. One player may be strong 
as a scorer while her coun
terpart is more defensively 
geared. We have the ability to 
rotate a variety of lineups. We 
have a long way to go, but this 
group comes to work every 
single day.
The win over John Carroll 
showed this athleticism, ver
satility, and hard work that 
Coach Seidl mentioned and 
was a team effort. Cortese 
earned a double-double with 
24 points and 12 rebounds, 
Larsen took 15 points and sev
en rebounds, Phillips scored 
10 points and dished out six 
assists, and Peel added nine 
points and nine rebounds.
Larsen was named to the 
All-Tournament team, while 
Cortese was named the tour
naments most valuable play
er.
The Tartans will hit the 
hardwood next when they 
visit Grove City College on 
Tuesday for a 6 p.m. tipoff.

Mens soccer makes NCAA history but falls to Calvin 1-2
VLAD BOUCHOUEV
Staffwriter
If you werent at Gesling Stadi
um last Friday evening, you missed 
out on a very memorable night at 
Carnegie Mellon University. The 
mens soccer team, who had a ter
rific season overall after finishing 
first in the University Athletic As
sociation (UAA) conference and 
setting multiple records, unfortu
nately werent able to progress to 
the Elite Eight of the NCAA tourna
ment. Nonetheless, this was quite 
the milestone for Carnegie Mellon, 
and our university was blessed to 
have one of its largest and loudest 
crowds come out to support the 
mens team.
The large and rowdy crowd 
wasnt just a result of giveaways 
from the university. It was the 
impressive play of the mens soc
cer team throughout the year that 
gradually attracted more and more 
fans. For the first time in school 
history, the Tartans advanced to 
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tour
nament. Senior center-back Jon 
Hall was named to the ESPN the 
Magazine Mens Soccer First Team 
Academic All-American of the Year 
for the second consecutive season; 
joining him on the first team for 
the first time this year were fel
low seniors Ryan Browne, Ricky 
Griffin, Austin Good, and Keith
Haselhoff. Meanwhile the senior 
offensive trio of Griffin, Browne, 
and Pat Lutz combined for 38 goals 
for the season. Griffin himself had 
19 goals, putting his career total to 
an outstanding 51 goals, including 
a record five goals against St. Vin
cents College, and collected his 
second consecutive UAA Player of 
the Year award.
Despite an impressive and con
sistent performance throughout 
the season, the Tartans fell 2-1 
to Calvin College, to end the year 
with a 16-3-1 season record. Car
negie Mellon easily beat Calvin in 
last years NCAA Tournament, 3-0. 
The only difference this year was 
that, ironically, the Tartans put out 
an even better team this year than 
from the year before. So why did 
they lose? Well, as the British say, 
football is a funny game.
Both teams came out playing 
disciplined defense, but unlike 
at other Carnegie Mellon home 
games, the Tartans werent able 
to attack with the same force. Two 
players seemed to be constantly 
covering Lutz, and Griffin couldnt 
seem to find the space that he usu
ally sees. As a result, most of the 
game was played in the midfield.
But late in the game, Calvin 
College found a way to get through 
to the Tartans end of the field and 
win a throw-in. Given that rare 
chance, Calvin made no mistake
in taking advantage of the oppor
tunity. One flick after another in 
the Tartans box led to a goal by 
Calvin substitute Chris Nance. Im
mediately, Carnegie Mellons head 
coach Aaron Lujan brought on 
sophomore forward Brad Edelman 
in hope of more attacking play. As 
the Tartans pushed up in search for 
an equalizer, Calvin College found 
Carnegie Mellon out of position 
and scored a second goal.
As all hope seemed to fade 
away, the persistent attackers for 
the Cardinal and Gray were able to 
notch their first of the game just 30 
seconds later. The Tartans contin
ued to press and nearly got a late 
tying goal late in the 89th minute 
when they were awarded a free 
kick just outside the Calvin box. 
Browne, who has had a sensational 
NCAA tournament, curled the ball 
to the far post, but Calvin Colleges 
quick goalie Ryan Bratt just got 
his hand to the ball and swatted 
it away to clinch the game 1-2 for 
the Knights.
Despite having one of the best 
teams ever to play at Gesling Sta
dium, Carnegie Mellon must now 
look forward to next season. With 
the current underclassmen show
ing much promise and a student 
body that proved that it is very 
much alive, the Tartans will look 
to build upon this years success in 
2010.

When the average indi
vidual thinks about college 
sports, often Division I power
house teams such as Univer
sity of North Carolina or the 
University of Pittsburgh come 
to mind. Division III sports 
receive no respect because 
many people believe that Di
vision III is merely for athletes 
who couldnt make a Division 
I team. However, any top D3 
athlete knows that they can 
compete with some of the top 
teams in Dl, and many of the 
students at Carnegie Mellon 
are realizing this as well.
Just last Friday, the Carne
gie Mellon mens soccer team 
competed in their first ever 
NCAA Sweet 16. And possibly 
for the first time, the stands at 
Gesling Stadium were filled 
to capacity. Some people may 
say it was the free pizza and 
T-shirts, but after attending 
the game, that was definitely 
not the case. Posters and Tshirts littered the stands. Avid 
fans dressed up in red to show 
their support for the Tartans. 
The crowd was definitely an 
impact on the game, due to 
the various cheers that almost 
propelled the Tartans to an 
amazing comeback.
Overall, the Tartans sports 
have been making a greater 
impact on the typical students 
life than many people realize. 
The past few weeks, the hype 
of this particular soccer game 
was off the charts. One of the 
Facebook events for the game 
reported that over 400 people 
were coming to the game, and 
that number was definitely 
reached.
Also, the mens tennis 
team recently came off a huge 
victory over number 2 ranked 
Amherst College. This win was 
the most memorable victory 
in mens tennis and vaulted 
this improving program into 
the top 10 for the first time in 
history. Their womens coun
terpart has solidified their top 
five ranking after coming off
another strong fall season. 
The womens tennis team has 
consistently been ranked in 
the top 10 for the past three 
years. With good coaching 
and hard-working players be
ing recruited for all sports, 
Carnegie Mellon sports will 
be a force to be reckoned with 
for years to come.
As the Tartan athletes be
come a force to be reckoned 
with, so is the fan support. 
With a few victories and con
tinued effort from fans to 
show up to sports games, Car
negie Mellon can diversify its 
talents to become recognized 
not only as having strong 
academics and groundbreak
ing research, but also as a 
formidable opponent on 
the field. Fans are becoming 
more attached to the teams, 
and this support will create a 
more unified student body. To 
quote one of the chants from 
Fridays soccer game, many 
will proudly say they are A 
Tartan till I die, I will always 
be a Tartan till I die.
Cross country competes at NCAAs
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
cross country team traveled 
to Clevelands Highland Park 
Golf Course this past Satur
day to compete at the NCAA 
Division III Championships. 
Sophomore Matt Jacob led 
the way for the Tartans to a 
12th place finish at the meet, 
which was hosted by Baldwin-Wallace College. Firstyear Emily Wobb competed 
at NCAAs, serving as the sole 
representative of the womens 
team.
The Tartans came into 
the meet looking to improve 
on their 13th place perfor
mance in 2008. This looked 
to be quite a challenge, as 
that Tartans team was led by 
09 graduate Brian Harveys 
ninth-place individual finish. 
But as junior J.P. Allera had 
said about the current teams 
strength after they swept the 
Carnegie Mellon Invite, We 
dont have any guys really far
up [in the rankings], but ... 
our spread was really low. 
That low spread proved to be 
the difference this year, as 
the team managed to improve 
their team standing by one 
place despite their highest 
individual finish being 61st 
place.
That performance be
longed to Jacobs, who crossed 
the finish line in 26:29.0, 
only 2.6 seconds ahead of ju
nior Dan Addis, who came in 
67th. Allera was right behind 
them, finishing in 26:34.1 for 
73rd overall. Senior captain 
Dario Donatelli finished next 
for the Tartans, with a time 
of 27:03.3. The closeness of 
the group demonstrated ex
actly what Allera had talked 
about; last year, the Tartans 
top four finishes were ninth 
(Harvey), 54th (Donatelli), 
145th (Breck Fresen 09) and 
168th (Addis).
Rounding out the field 
for the Tartans in Cleveland, 
junior Nate Bussiere crossed 
5.5 seconds behind Donatelli,
senior Chris Rizzo finished 
in 28:09.8, and junior Justin 
Kurp crossed six places later 
in 28:24.0.
There were a few factors 
that led to the teams higher 
finish this year; however, 
the main reason was that we 
were much closer as a team 
and were able to put together 
good races on the same day, 
Donatelli said. Last year, the 
team had a lot of potential 
but ... did not perform up to 
potential at nationals, but this 
year we had a much better 
performance on that day.
I do feel that we accom
plished what we set out to do. 
The goal was to finish better 
than last year, and we were 
able to.... I have high hopes 
for the team next year as they 
are only losing two runners 
and have a lot of experience, 
so they are in good shape for 
the future.

Staffwriter
During the opening round of the 
NCAA Division III Mens Soccer Cham
pionship, senior Ryan Browne put up 
an impressive three goals across the 
two games, scoring twice against 
Thomas Moore and clinching 
the win over Medaille College 
on a penalty kick. Brownes 
performance helped ad 
vance the Tartans to the 
sectionals round of the 
tournament for the first 
time in Carnegie Mel
lons history.
The University Ath
letic Association (UAA) 
also recognized Browne 
for his efforts, naming him 
Mens Soccer Athlete of the 
Week.
Such success is no strange 
feat for Browne, who has 
been a four year starter 
for the Tartans. Along with 
serving as a consistent driv
ing force from the midfield,
Browne has tallied numerous 
national honors from College 
Sports Information Directors 
of America (CoSIDA), the 
UAA, and the National Soccer 
Coaches Association of Amer
ica (NSCAA). Most recently,
Browne joined a handful of his 
teammates in being named 
Academic All-Americans by 
ESPN the Magazine.
Kristen
A native, of Pittsburgh, Browne notes 
the small feel of a big city and the con
venience of being close to his family as 
bonuses of going to school at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Browne stays involved in the 
world of student athletes, serving 
on the Student Athlete Advisory 
Council (SAAC) to promote 
school spirit within the cam
pus community while also 
connecting with surround
ing communities through 
mentoring and outreach 
initiatives.
Browne will head 
to New York City after 
graduation to work for 
Citigroup in their Capital 
Markets division.
Before he goes, he has some 
parting words for his under
classmen: Whatever it is you 
do in your life, always strive 
for perfection and to be the 
best. It is important that you 
never become complacent 
and just satisfied with where 
you are. Always have a drive 
for bigger and better things and 
have the discipline to put in the 
hard work and time and you 
will succeed.
Browne has clearly been fol
lowing his own advice over his 
career at Carnegie Mellon and 
can be proud of his noteworthy 
athletic and academic accom
plishments.

Sophomore Jacki Cortese led the Tartans in total points this weekend. The 
Tartans topped Bethany, John Caroll, and Marietta to enter this week with
a 3-0 winning streak.
The Carnegie Mellon 
womens basketball team 
finished their first week 
strong, opening the season 
at home and hosting the 
University Athletic Associa
tion (Ohio Athletic Associa
tion Challenge) with a per
fect record of 3-0.
Last Monday was the Tar
tans home opener against 
Bethany College, and they 
tallied their first win of the 
season, 60-55. Carnegie 
Mellon was anxious to run as 
they took the early 7-4 lead 
before the Bison had five 
quick possessions and took 
their only lead of the game, 
9-7. With 14:44 left on the 
clock, first-year forward 
Emily Peel hit a jumper, and 
two plays later, sophomore 
center Jacki Cortese scored 
a layup to regain the Tartan 
lead at 11-9. Heading into 
halftime, the Cardinal and 
Gray held a 28-25 lead.
In the second half, Car
negie Mellons biggest lead 
was 11 points, 50-39, with 
4:10 to play in the game.

Nirvana through neologisms Everything you need to know
Exhibition at The Frame gsllry xplorss common CrmoniS  About being dateless and becoming daring
Rituals play a role in many parts of life, from day-today habits like brushing ones teeth after getting up 
in the morning to religious ceremonies. Theilow of 
university semesters, the semiannual registration for 
classes, even the passing of the seasons is a kind of 
a ritual in its eternal cycle.
Last Friday at 7 p.m. at The Frame Gallery, senior 
art and dramaturgy major Molly McCurdy and junior 
dramaturgy major Lauren Parks staged a production 
centered on the presence of rituals in our lives. Upon 
entering Pantheon of Neologisms, visitors were met 
with a fantasy-like area in which the exhibit was 
acted out. Multicolored streamers hung from the 
ceiling, swinging in the dim light as a carousel horse 
hung overhead and a wooden mummy-like sculpture 
leaned against a wall. A silent montage of film clips 
flickered against a wall, as a mixture of chanting 
songs played in the background.
Everywhere visitors looked, they saw objects 
juxtaposed out of their own worlds and into The 
Frame. The production space was divided into four 
sections that corresponded to the four seasons.
McCurdy and Parks began th production with 
spring and performed their way through all of the 
seasonal areas in order, acting out various rituals 
along the way. In the spring cave, constructed with 
fairy lights and hung linen, they played with flowers; 
they then played ball games on a trampoline in the 
summer area, in which hundreds of blue and white 
plastic bags were fastened to the walls.
The autumn area consisted of a swathe of flags 
and tapestries creating a canopy over a sitting area 
constructed with pillows, surrounded by random 
candles, toys, and a platter of food. Finally, winter 
was created by a small pool filled with water and 
surrounded by suitcases and mirrors. The last room,
bare except for an ornate chair in the center and

The artists depicted autumn as a cozy sitting area 
littered with cushions, candles, toys, and food.
filled with red light, represented the nirvana that 
could be obtained through these rituals.
McCurdy and Parks made their way through the 
seasons several times, acting out rituals like bowing 
to an altar, playing with toys, and arranging food and 
offering it to guests. Other than this repetition, their 
performance was mainly improvised. Guests talked, 
ate the offerings of food, and watched the rituals 
being performed throughout the seasons.
The exhibit was fascinating and beautiful, mixing 
elements of nostalgia with exotic pieces like 
small religious statues and foreign flags. Firstyear art major Lauren Faigeles commented on the 
impression of the exhibit as she watched McCurdy 
and Parks perform: Its like childhood for adults.
After the performance, guests were free to mingle 
and examine the structures around them, as well as 
partake in the food. "If I could live in a dream land, 
this is how Id want to live, Jena Tegeler, a firstyear science and humanities scholar, said as she sat 
under the autumn display.
The entire production area was constructed in. a 
single night, although McCurdy and Parks had been 
collecting supplies for several weeks. When asked 
about the inspiration for this production, McCurdy 
said that it was based on "fluxes and happenings 
from the 60s, and it was a way to recreate your 
own sense of origin.
We're working with cycles and things we like, 
Parks said as a way of summary. Its about social 
dramas, rituals, ceremonies, and finding nirvana." 
When asked if they had found nirvana through 
this production, Parks and McCurdy laughed, and 
McCurdy responded, In a way.

Dear Rohit,
Ive never been the person 
who approaches a girl to 
ask her out. In fact, Ive 
only done it once and 
only after some serious 
seesawing with myself. 
However, I have found 
myself in a position where 
I really like someone. The 
only hang-up is that shes 
a junior and I myself am 
a lowly first-year. How 
can I get past that sinking 
feeling of inferiority and, 
at the same time, confront 
my fear of actually trying 
to ask a girl out?
Pretty Passive Person
Dear P to the third power,
My most sincere advice 
would be to pick up. some 
courage and just ask her 
out. Seriously! How can 
you expect to get what you 
want if you dont go for it? 
Think of it like this: Things 
could always go really wrong. 
But youll never know how 
horrible everything will go 
until you dip that toe into the 
pool of iove, or whatever it is 
that you are dipping into.
As for the older woman, who 
knows If your lady isnt the 
cougar type? She could like 
a younger man, assuming 
youve completed puberty. 
More importantly, two years 
may seem like a lot of time 
now, but its not much at all. I 
can think of plenty of couples, 
mostly of the celebrity 
persuasion, that have up to 
15-year gaps in age.
Tap that!

Dear Rohit,
I have a problem. As of 
today, I have never had 
a real girlfriend. You 
know, someone who I 
actually took places and 
we would hold hands  
mushy stuff like that. And 
now, Im feeling a little 
overwhelmed seeing a lot 
of my friends in committed 
relationships. Is it okay 
that Im 19 and have never 
had a real girlfriend? What 
can I do to rid myself of 
that fear of being alone 
forever? Help!
Scared and Dateless
Dear Dateless Darling,
It sounds lame, but everything 
happens for a reason. It 
may seem like there are 
oh-so-many people with 
significant others frolicking 
all over campus, grossing 
out the typical passerby, but 
that doesnt mean everyone 
is kickin it with someone 
special. Youre in college 
now, and I think the most 
important part of college is 
learning about yourself. Youll 
be able to know what you 
. want and what you dont, 
what turns you off and what 
gets you... excited. Life is too 
short  and if the right girl 
is around, you two will find 
each other.
Regarding fear of loneliness 
that lasts forever, dont 
worry. Things tend to 
work themselves out. Just 
remember that life can 
change in a moment and 
you never know when that 
moment will hit you.
Im still waiting.
Dont fret!

Tales from abroad: Panama
Healthcare and education make memorable moments for the medical brigade
This past August, 11 Carnegie Mellon students traveled 
to Panama for a week to participate in a medical 
brigade. A medical brigade consists of a team of student 
and medical professional volunteers organized into a 
mobile medical unit, setting up temporary day clinics 
to diagnose and treat patients for free. We were joined 
by one student from Albion College, two students 
from the University of North Carolina, and many nurse 
practitioners, registered nurses, arid nursing students 
from Samuel Merritt University in California. For three 
days, we visited the two communities of Chriqui Viejo 
and Soloy.
Memorable moments: Beth Aguila
While shadowing a nurse practitioner for the day, I saw 
one family that I will never forget. The family consisted 
of a mother who was eight months pregnant, her two 
sons, and a grandmother. They had walked for nearly an 
hour and a half to visit our temporary day clinic.
The two children and the mother had all of the typical 
issues plaguing the community  severe dehydration, 
vitamin deficiencies, parasites, and fungal infections. 
However, it was the grandmother who captured my 
attention. She was nearly 80 years old, and she had come 
to the clinic to watch the two boys while her daughter 
was given a checkup. Although she seemed remarkably 
healthy for an 80-year-old woman, we realized that 
she had severe tachycardia  a condition in which 
a persons heart rate exceeds the normal range for a 
resting heart rate.
We discovered that the grandmother usually goes for an 
entire day without drinking water or eating. Since food 
and water are so scarce for her family, she often gave up 
her share for her pregnant daughter and grandchildren. 
The nurse and I then attempted to explain to her the
importance of eating and drinking at least seven glasses 
of water a day, especially in such a hot region.
However, it was not this learning experience that made 
me remember them; instead, it was the pure joy and 
gratitude the grandmother and her family felt toward us 
that was memorable. For the rest of the day, every time 
the grandmother saw me, she would grab my hand and 
thank me profusely. This experience showed me how 
just 20 minutes of providing care to a family who almost 
never gets the chance to see a medical professional can 
mean the world to them.
Memorable moments: Eda Akyar
While on the brigade, we encountered many truly 
amazing and memorable Panamanians whose stories 
were uplifting, to say the least. As a non-native Spanish 
speaker, I worried, about my speaking abilities upon 
arrival in Panama. I had taken seven years of Spanish 
and studied abroad during the summer for seven weeks 
in Madrid, Spain after my first year at Carnegie Mellon; 
however, due to the fact that we would be working 
with Spanish speakers who had no English education
 unlike many Spaniards in Madrid  in addition to 
some Panamanians who knew only their own indigenous 
language, I knew I would face the challenge of a 
language barrier.
But after a week of complete immersion, I felt as if I had 
gained all of my speaking abilities (and confidence) back.
On the third day of our brigade, I had a chance to 
shadow a doctor. Toward the latter part of the day, 
one of the providers pulled me aside; she needed help 
translating. After working through two patients with her, 
she told me to go ahead and just try my own patient.
And so, with the providers supervision, I took a history
of my own patient, explaining to the provider all of the 
patients health conditions and lifestyle, diagnosed 
the patient, and produced some recommendations for 
medicine and dosage.
I then saw three more patients on my own. Although we 
were working in rather uncomfortable conditions  a 
lack of proper lighting or air conditioning leaving us 
drenched in our own sweat  I had never felt happier in 
my life.
Being able to communicate with the patients, I 
established a comfortable relationship with them. I was 
able to empathize with them, which made me more 
determined to provide the best care that I possibly could. 
With the provider double-checking my every decision,
I made recommendations for each patient, considering 
family history and environmental factors including home 
life and typical working conditions. The best part of the 
whole experience was walking the patient over to the 
pharmacy to pick up the medicine that I recommended
 the gratitude I saw in each patients face was 
indescribable.
Ultimately, our brigade provided free medical care to 
nearly 700 patients in only three days. Our Carnegie 
Mellon brigade was able to raise and deliver over 
$60,000 worth of medicine to Panama. The medicine we 
provided helped patients with a wide range of illnesses, 
spanning from vitamin deficiencies to heart murmurs. 
The brigade experience was truly one of a kind, and 
we all look forward to our next brigade to Panama this 
coming summer.

New music this November
OneRepublic and Jason Mrazs release albums
OneRepublic and Jason Mraz, a pop rock band 
and an alternative singer-songwriter, recently 
released new albums. With the bands new song 
list, OneRepublic is attempting to prove that they 
are more than just a one-hit wonder, while Mraz 
showcases some of his best moments while on tour 
around the country. Read on to find out how these 
new albums fared critically and if theyre worth the 
listen.
One Republic  Waking Up
You may only recognize OneRepublic as "those guys 
that sing that 'Apologize' song, but with the release 
of their sophomore album, Waking Up, on Nov. 17, 
theyre determined not just to provide the world with 
a carbon copy of the song that propelled them into 
the mainstream scene. In an interview for Campus 
Circle, drummer Eddie Fisher mentioned that people 
shouldnt expect another Apologize on Waking Up, 
saying, If you chase something that massive, you 
have a high percentage of it completely failing.
The albums leading track, Made For You, 
represents the CD as a whole, merging different 
styles and orchestral elements. Starting off by 
showcasing Ryan Tedders piano skills, the song 
then progresses into the band chanting lyrics from 
All the Right Moves (another song on the album), 
and concludes with exactly the unexpected: the 
audio of a conductor tapping his baton and a boys 
choir angelically repeating what the band has just 
sung.
Secrets is a prime example of how the cello (the 
bands most unique characteristic) can be blended 
with a powerful chorus and almost hip-hop-like 
verses about how the songs written are true and 
not just money-makers. Songs like All This Time" 
and Fear also feature the cello greatly, while other 
songs break new ground, like the quirky "Everybody

Jason Mrazs CD, Beautiful Mess, released 
recently to rave reviews.
Loves Me ^relying heavily on the acoustic guitars 
twang) and Good Life (featuring a strong drum 
beat and a faint synthesizer).
This time/dont need another perfect line/dont 
care if critics never jump in line/Im gonna give all 
my secrets away. This is a lyric from Secrets/ and 
it sums up the bands identity in that they write 
honest, heartfelt lyrics that dont seek out a number 
one spot on the Billboard charts, even though with 
Waking Up, thats certainly a realistic feat.
Jason Mraz  Beautiful Mess - Live on Earth
This past August, Jason Mraz performed at 
Chicagos Charter One Pavilion, and on a stage 
adorned with oriental rugs, Mraz let loose a 
wonderful volley of sweet melodies to a throng of 
his devoted and adoring fans. Recorded as part of 
his Beautiful Mess - Live on Earth tour, which is 
still ongoing, Mrazs live CD and DVD of the concert 
were released on Nov. 10 to great critical acclaim. It 
features not only the smash hits "Im Yours, "The 
Remedy, and Lucky, but also Mraz at his absolute 
best.
Mraz burst onto the scene in 2002 with his debut 
album, Waiting for my Rocket to Come, and the 
single, The Remedy, which peaked in the top 
15 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. This was not 
the last we would see of Mraz as, just three years 
later, he released the album Mr. A-Z, receiving 
some commercial and critical success along with 
hitting fifth on the Billboard album chart. Just last 
year, Mraz released We Sing. We Dance. We Steal 
Things, which brought him by far his widest level of 
recognition and great international success.
Mrazs Beautiful Mess - Live on Earth is a skillfully 
put together CD and DVD album that takes some 
of his best tracks from his first and third studio 
albums to form quite the set list. Mraz is adept at 
orchestrating a symphony out of his legion of fans 
and controls his audience as if hes been doing it for 
years, knowing when he needs to add a little extra 
and when to Just simply kick things into gear.
At one point during the concert, Mraz jokes that 
pretty much all hes got are love songs, which is a 
very true statement. While he does sprinkle in pop 
 sounds and extremely catchy rhythms and beats, his 
lyrics focus on love quite a bit. If youre interested in 
catching him live, check out www.jasonmiaz.com 
for his upcoming concert dates.

On winter sing-alongs
Lets face it, folks: Weve been spoiled. In contrast to the 
last couple of years, weve been granted the blessing of fall 
this year. Not just autumn, but an autumn thats felt more 
like summer. The leaves have been holding out for months 
and the grass is still green. Never before has my resplendent 
supply of T-shirts lasted me so long. But our time of Indian 
summer is winding down, and I have a feeling that it might 
make this winters transition even rougher.
Now, to put things in perspective, I will remind you that 
Pittsburgh actually has a temperate climate. Sure, our winter 
feels like the worst thing in the world  long and wet and 
lonely. My friend Ben, however, spent last year in Iceland, 
and youd better believe things are a lot rougher there. In a 
country riddled with depression (thats personal and economic 
depression), its hard to keep a level head during the eternal 
winter season.
So what do they do? Well, in addition to eating various kinds 
of animal meat youve never heard of (and probably dont 
want to), residents sometimes get together for a good olfashioned sing-along. Using simple acoustic instrumentation, 
these gatherings are informal and usually just a way of warming 
up the cold and windy winter nights  a little whiskey, a little 
song, what more could you need?
On Dec. 4, the sing-along returns to the winter season, but 
this time as an interactive trans-city experience. Ben will be 
hosting a group in Cleveland, Ohio that will be in live video/ 
audio communication with a group in Pittsburgh to be hosted 
at the Waffle Shop. The cities will switch leading songs by the 
likes of R. Kelly, Beck, Dolly Parton, and more. Its a modern 
twist on an old-fashioned winter remedy. We may not be in 
Iceland, nor yet in the heart of our worst months, but it cant 
hurt to start a new routine in curing the winter blues.

Tips of the trade: Slicing and seasoning
Some simple ideas to keep you from being clueless while whipping up dinner in the kitchen
Just like those smart students in your class who know 
exactly how to solve a.problem after just reading the 
question, experienced cooks hold sharp, eight-inch 
chef's knives confidently. From a distance, they can tell if 
the pasta is uncooked, and once an egg is cracked out of 
its shell, they know if that particular egg is fresh or not.
In an attempt to make the kitchen and cooking more 
approachable, I have compiled this list of what I do in my 
own kitchen. With a better basic knowledge of working 
in the kitchen, some of you will find peace and joy in 
cooking.
Cold cuts
Remember high school chemistry? An object at a lower 
temperature has less molecular movement, and this 
applies to everything in the kitchen, as well. Meat, 
cheese, and vegetables are firmer when they are cooler.
Think about crunchy, cold salad: The vegetables are 
easier to chop when cool. Chilled meat is also easier to 
cut because it holds its shape better.
Seasoning
Caramelize when you can. This is not referring to 
caramel sugar candy but browning onions, chicken, and 
steak. The brown color that catches onto vegetable or 
meat as you cook is because the natural sugar is being 
caramelized, and this imparts more flavor to the food.
Onion can bring magic to many dishes. The flavors of 
onion are transformed when it is cooked differently, and 
adding onion in various ways to a dish lends a rounder 
sweetness to the dish. When boiled, onion imparts 
its sweet flavor to the boiling water and you get a 
sweet broth. The onion itself becomes translucent and 
soft. When onion is sauteed in oil, the water in onion 
evaporates at lower temperatures than oil or butter, and 
with less water, the sugars and other minerals in the 
onions are more concentrated, giving them a stronger, 
sweeter, caramelized flavor. Different cooking methods 
impart different flavors for a reason.
Aside from salt and pepper, many kinds of natural 
flavoring give a more complex flavor, and one can end up 
with something striking. Think of salty bacon in omelets, 
soy sauce in stir-fry, grated Parmesan over pasta, and 
honey in place of sugar.
Measuring correctly
American recipes measure amounts in volume and not 
by weight, so scooping out flour from a dense flour bag 
will give you more flour than needed. The actual amount 
of flour you get varies significantly. The ideal way to 
measure a dry ingredient is to spoon the ingredient into 
the measuring cup for consistent density. In practicality, 
stir the dry ingredient to prevent any lumps and dense 
areas before measuring, and then level off the dry 
ingredient with the dull side of the knife.
Not all sugars are equal
Granulated sugar, light brown sugar, and dark brown 
sugar cannot be substituted in baking like they can in
cooking. They are chemically different. Brown sugar has 
higher molasses content than White granulated sugar. 
Baking with brown sugar when the recipe asks for white 
sugar can give you a very dense cake. Most of the time, 
brown sugar, both light and dark, can be use in savory 
dishes. The milder sweet taste it provides is not as 
aggressive as white sugar.
Read the textbook and follow the equation
Follow the recipe the first time. You dont have to like 
the first taste. Tasting is a matter of personal preference, 
and you can identify what you dont like and make the 
change next time.
If you dont follow the recipe, and something is messed 
up, you dont know where exactly you went wrong. 
Knowing exactly what you put in for the first' time and 
understanding how the resulting flavor developed from 
each ingredient is crucial. After good practice, you will 
gain a sense of how each ingredient contributes.
This kitchen sense  how a dish is built up from simple 
flavors  will take you a long way in cooking. Once 
youve become a seasoned cook, you can see, smell, and 
taste the dish by just reading the recipe.

While cutting meat, make sure to cut it across the grain. 
The grain in meat is the muscle fiber, and you want to 
cut across the muscle fiber as it makes for tender meat.

Left: Whatever spices, sauces, or oils you choose to 
use, make sure you keep the natural flavoring of the 
food in mind. Center: Cleaning up after you cook is 
always important. Using rubber gloves makes the task 
much easier. Above: Make sure you know how to read 
and control the oven dial to prevent any mishaps.

Squirrel Hill offers up Asian delicacies
Sample corn fritters, homemade ice tea at Silk Elephant, Sun Penang
Its the end of the semester and free time is scarce. While 
studying for finals, getting final portfolios done, and 
finishing those term papers, it is important to make the 
most of that free time by relaxing and there is no better 
way to do that than by heading up to Squirrel Hill and 
visiting some of Pittsburghs best Asian restaurants. Silk 
Elephant and Sun Penang both offer a different taste of 
Asian cuisine.
Silk Elephant is the newest restaurant opened by the 
chef of Bangkok Balcony. Billed as a tapas and wine 
bar, there are many surprises that make customers feel 
as if they are in rural Thailand. The decor creates a 
welcoming atmosphere that finishes the Asian dynamic 
of the meal. Tapas are the most popular dishes on the 
menu.
The corn fritters, a customer favorite, are made of
lightly fried corn and complemented by a sweet chili 
sauce. Moo and Goong steamed dumplings are another 
excellent choice, as they are full of flavor and texture. On 
the main menu, the Pad See Ew is an excellent dish for 
a group to share. This restaurant is definitely worth a try. 
It has a relaxing experience, the service is attentive, and 
the food comes out of the kitchen fairly quickly. All in all, 
Silk Elephant is a unique dining experience in Squirrel 
Hill that provides authentic Thai cuisine.
Sun Penang is a quiet restaurant located in the 
commercial section of Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill. 
The restaurant is comfortable and dark, allowing the 
customer to escape the dreary Pittsburgh weather. 
Inspired by Malaysian cooking, the menu is long and 
extensive. Penang Char Kway Teow is their best dish; 
this noodle medley combines various seafood- and 
vegetable-based dishes with a slight kick of spice. When
dining at Sun Penang, customers should make sure to 
order their homemade iced tea. Sun Penang offers a very 
solid and rejuvanating meal.
*
Both of these restaurants bring a different taste of Asian 
cuisine to Squirrel Hill. Since it is only a short bus ride 
up Forbes from campus, these places make for the 
perfect escape from the third floor of Hunt library.

Silk Elephant is located at 1712 Murray Avenue. Sun

depending on the number of people youre serving, but 
feel free to make a lot because this treat keeps well. 
Follow the directions on the label, and then add the 
purple food dye until its just the right shade of violet.
Pour the pudding into a bowl and layer the top with 
thick slices of bananas, followed by thin slices of 
strawbenies. Squirt the whipped cream liberally on 
top  make a mountain if you feel like it  and 
then sprinkle the blueberries on top of this Mt. 
Everest of sugar and decorate with the sugared 
flowers.
These are just a few of the many delicious 
recipes mentioned in books. If youre still 
feeling hungry after trying these treats, 
attempt making some pasta puttanesca 
from A Series of Unfortunate Events: The 
Bad Beginning, rout cake from Emma, or rice 
pudding from A Winters Tale. Have fun eating,

Sushi plays big roll in Pittsburgh dining
Your guide to the exotic, affordable, and delicious sushi in our greater Pittsburgh area
When one thinks about all of the amazing things that 
Pittsburgh has to offer, high-quality Japanese cuisine 
doesnt typically come to mind. However, here in the 
area around Carnegie Mellon, we have a wide selection 
of Japanese restaurants at students disposal. Carnegie 
Mellon students have always had fantastic, tasty, and 
affordable sushi available just a short walk away.
Why eat sushi?
Sushi is high in protein, low in fat, and contains omega-3 
fatty acids that help prevent diabetes and blood clots. 
While one should always be aware of the origin of the 
fish and seafood to limit parasitic risk, overall, sushi is a 
low-risk, healthy meal option.
When looking for an exciting new restaurant or just a 
place to grab some lunch, consider these sushi venues, 
all within walking distance of campus.
Sushi Too
Chances are you've seen their sushi boxes around 
campus, but have you ever tried Sushi Too fresh at 
Resnik Caf? The pre-boxed sushi makes for a nice meal 
whether studying late at the library or catching a quick 
lunch at the UC, but venture over to Resnik House for 
fresh, personalized rolls made right in front of you.
I love eating the campus sushi, said Ryan Oksenhorn, a. 
first-year CIT student. Its a quick, easy, and light meal. 
Its not like much of the other campus options  all
fried and greased. They make you feel slowed down and 
unhealthy.
Not feeling like fish? The chefs at Sushi Too will gladly 
whip you up a medley of vegetable rolls. Cucumber, 
asparagus, and fresh avocado rolls, served with a hint 
of ginger and wasabi, make for a healthy and tasty 
lunch alternative. The best thing about Sushi Too: the 
convenience. Not having to leave campus for your 
appetizing sushi snack is always a positive.
Sakura
Sakura Teppanyaki & Sushi is perfect for an elegant 
meal. Situated right off Forbes in Squirrel Hill, Sakura 
is a short walk for Carnegie Mellon students and is well 
worth the trip.
Whether youre entertaining parents for a weekend or 
treating your significant other to a classy dinner, Sakura 
has the perfect atmosphere. While the prices aren't 
significantly low, the sushi is fresh and incredibly wellprepared.
"I especially like the specialty rolls, said Collin Burger, 
a first-year in CIT. Every time I go, there is something 
different on the menu. They like being super creative 
with their specials. Just last week they had this deep 
fried roll called the Green Fuji Roll. Fried sushi was a first 
for me; that was interesting. Creativity has definitely 
become a facet of the Sakura chefs. The owners, 
Fengping Geng and Feng Gao, love to inspire diversity
with their weekly menu changes.
"Last time I was there, Burger said, I got this special 
called the spicy tuna sandwich. It was this mound on 
rice just smothered in the best-tasting tuna and avocado. 
I swear, it was the single best thing I have ever tasted.
Oishi Bento
Located in a small nook right near the University of 
Pittsburgh on Oakland Avenue, this restaurant offers 
its customers fast, cheap, and delicious Korean and 
Japanese cuisine.
The upside: You can get more than enough food for 
under five dollars. With teriyaki bento boxes, rolls of 
sushi, and soups galore, Oishi is well-priced and speedy 
with its delivery. The downside: Getting a table can 
be nearly impossible. Oishi customers follow a specific 
procedure  you order your food at the register and then 
claim property on one of the two floors of seating. The 
only problem is that since Oishi is a pretty popular place, 
it can be difficult to find a table.
I brought a couple of my friends to Oishi just last week, 
said Eliot Knudson, a first-year in H&SS. They had never 
been there, but they loved it. My advice: If you have a 
bigger party, try going earlier in the evening so you can 
get a table.

A notice appeared In The Tartan advising 
that the dean is in possession of a box 
of cigars that he offers to students who 
visit him. I can only wonder if President 
Cohon has his own box of old stogies to 
hand out, though I suppose hed have 
candy cigars instead.
__ Over 100 spectators apparently turned
out for a co-rec volleyball semifinals

Nov 18 1959 is basically an intramural game. I feel 
like someone in charge of varsity sports 
should get on the phone with 1959 
to figure out the secret to attracting a 
crowd.
__ A first-year graduate student vented
(J -7 in a Letter to the Editor about a past

Real music, new sound
The evolution of beat, genre, and musical element
Music is a language that predates words. It consists 
of simple sounds and beats put together to create a 
rhythm. Even banging on a trash can or shaking a 
salt shaker is music. Twentieth-century composer 
John Cage thought that any sound could be music: 
"There is no noise, only sound. Regardless of the 
method, music has been around for a very long time 
and presents itself in various sizes, shapes, and 
forms as it has been transformed through cultures 
and traditions. The definition of music itself is one 
that cannot be simplified in one term, as many 
cultures interpretations differ.
Music was also an important part of culture in 
Greece. Greek philosophers and ancient Indian 
philosophers defined music as tones ordered 
horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. 
In ancient Greek theater, musicians and singers 
had a prominent role, and choruses performed for 
entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. 
One of the earliest musical traditions comes from 
India, as references to Indian classical music  or 
marga  can be found in the ancient scriptures of 
the Hindu tradition, the Vedas.
Common elements of music include pitch, rhythm, 
and dynamics. There are many more branches, as 
well as ones that stem from these few. While these 
terms and what they do were not always important, 
each of these elements has become necessary to 
communicate the language.
The development of music has occurred with 
the influence of natural sounds. It is very likely 
that it was influenced by animals and how they 
communicated. National Geographic published 
an article suggesting "that not only are natural 
sounds such as whale and bird songs music, but 
that their songs may be part of a universal music 
that provides an intuitive musical concept to many 
animals  including humans. Macaque monkeys 
drum objects in a way that shows social dominance. 
Even the beating of ones chest has a figurative 
meaning, but the sound it creates brings meaning 
to life.
Although no one can give a firsthand account of 
what music sounded like in ancient times, artifacts 
like bones have been found with lateral holes, 
resembling a flute. At the Indus valley civilization 
archaeological sites (currently parts of Pakistan 
and India), various stringed instruments have been 
recovered.
Though these discoveries may give us an idea of 
early music, the music we create today is all built 
upon what has already been done. In the 20th  
century, the way to hear music was by listening to 
the radio or a phonograph in the earlier years. The
genres of music have also become more defined as 
jazz took its place and became a strong influence 
over the course of the century. It originated in the 
southern states with an influence of African and 
European sounds. Rock music has also become 
popularized. It has spread out to become rock and 
roll, rockabilly blues, and country music. The guitar 
has a great influence on the sound of rock. Various 
styles of music have incorporated many instruments, 
such as the guitar, the piano, and the drums. While 
the drums were once used to communicate among 
Africans because the drums spoke when they could 
not, it has become a staple in music today.
The definition of music 
itself is one that cannot 
i)e simplified in one 
term, as many cultures 
interpretations differ.
Other forms of music  such as hip hop, modern, 
opera, barbershop music, cante jondo, disco, 
funk, new jack swing, and thousands of others  
have been created throughout generations and 
in different countries. Because of this, there are 
several hundreds of musical instruments, as just* 
about anything can be considered an instrument 
since hitting, plucking, or striking anything makes a 
sound. Songs today involve so many pieces of music; 
it is incredible to see how it has evolved over the 
centuries. String instruments and wind instruments 
are two kinds, but with all of the technology made 
available and all of the sounds electronics and nature 
have to offer, the musical possibilities are endless.
Musicians use these instruments or no instruments 
at all to perform and express themselves. Sometimes, 
artists can better express themselves through sound 
than through words. Gustav Mahler, a Bohemianborn Austrian composer and conductor active in the 
late 1800s, once said, "If a composer could say what 
he had to say in words, he would not bother trying to 
say it in music.

Go out into the wilderness  there you will meet a man who 
can give you a package. This package will contain a very 
important item, if you know what I mean.
Allowing a troupe of howler monkeys into your home, though 
very convenient for trash disposal, will be awkward for your 
sleep schedule.
Though it may have seemed wise at the time, your tuition 
was not better spent on colored pencils and construction 
paper.
Your significant other is secretly a witch and is currently 
performing a ritual to give you hoof and mouth disease.
Allowing your animal instincts to take over may seem like a 
good idea, but tearing into a cow with your bare hands is 
probably unwise.
Brains. Brains. Zombie horoscope writer needs brains!
Let your fashion instincts guide you: Your gut would never lie. 
Plaid socks with open-toed sandals can never look bad.
Take a vacation to sunny, tropical Alaska. This will help 
refresh your mind. The stars recommend the beach this time 
of year.
Go buck wild this weekend: Get a tribal tattoo on your lower 
back, take a vacation to Aruba, and hook up with the hottest 
person there.
Allowing your neighbor to house-sit this weekend may have 
been a bad idea, especially given that he is a convicted 
arsonist.
Attempting to deep-fry your own body parts without local 
anesthetic ends in disaster. Remember to get yourself 
anesthetized before you attempt to consume yourself.
A fish? Really? Your zodiac sign is a fish? Just give up, go 
home, and never leave your room again.

uptown combo.
Travis Wolfe | Photo Staff >- - . , * ...The Backstage Bar in Pittsburgh's theater district offers drinks, food, 
and live entertainment. Just last Friday, alternative jazz band Uptown 
Combo hit the stage. Pianist/singer Jack Bowen, guitarist Chris Jones, 
and bassist Jim Spears collaborated on a set of songs inspired by 
country, jazz, blues, and rock and roll. The band has been playing live 
music for the Backstage Bar at least once a month.
