A Carnegie Mellon Advisory 
Board to the School of Drama 
recently suggested that the depart
ment reevaluate and possibly excise 
the undergraduate directing major. 
This recommendation was part of a 
larger appraisal of the School that 
included numerous suggestions and 
observations, but the verbiage of 
the report is still confidential. The 
University-wide Advisory Board sys
tem was established in November of 
1990 under former President Robert 
Mehrabian, and since 1992, depart
ments have undergone board evalu
ations every three or four years. 
Advisory boards are intended to 
examine the broad picture of specif
ic departments and help them grow 
and conform to the overall 
University mission.Last fall, boards 
convened for the drama, music, and
philosophy departments, as well as 
the Institute for Complex 
Engineering Systems.
This semesters boards visited the 
math and history departments, 
human resources, and the Software 
Engineering Institute. The sevenmember drama school board con
vened in October for two days of 
observation of the faculty, staff, and 
overall operations of the drama 
school. Advisory boards normally 
include two or more trustees, with 
the remainder of a variable twelveperson committee drawn from rele
vant parts of industry and acade
mia. The committees, whose mem
bers are appointed by the University 
President, spend two days observ
ing faculty, students, and opera
tions, and then compile reports to 
be delivered to the full Board of 
Trustees by a trustee on the adviso

Minors removed, then 
reinstated on diplomas
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
With only four weeks until 
Commencement, administrators on 
Friday revoked a decision to print 
only majors on diplomas. Diplomas 
for this years graduates will be for
matted as they have been, with 
majors, minors, and tracks listed. 
When word got out last week that 
diplomas would be printed without 
minors and tracks, students 
responded with urgency and anger. 
Students have been completely 
sidestepped, said Vito Fiore, Senate 
chair. It really amounts to, whether 
intentional or not, the deception of 
students. Indira Nair, vice provost 
of education, said the decision to 
remove minors and tracks from the 
diplomas and to list them only on 
transcripts was made a few years 
ago. The implementation of that 
change was set for this year. All nec
essary parties were consulted at the 
time, including the Associate Deans 
Council, Deans Council, 
Department Heads Council, 
Presidents Council, and Student 
Senate.
It wasnt some thoughtless and 
sudden decision, said Nair. 
However, the process should have 
been one of informing and convers
ing with the current set of students 
rather than apparently springing 
this on them so close to graduation. 
This years students were not con
sulted, nor were they made aware of 
the change. According to Fiore, 
advisors had told students this year 
that minors and tracks would be 
printed on diplomas. Students were 
also able to view sample diplomas 
online, and up until two weeks ago, 
the prototype diplomas included 
minors and tracks. News spread by 
word of mouth when one student 
went online last week to view his 
diploma. Within a couple of days, 
dialogue between students on 
cmu.misc.market prompted Senates 
Academic Affairs Committee to start 
a petition. I havent seen this much 
of an outcry from students in a long
time, and I believe it is justified, 
said Fiore. Its not just the issue 
itself; its the way the issue was han
dled.
It is uncertain whether or not the 
change will be implemented for 
next years seniors. Fiore said 
Student Government intends to 
speak with the administration about 
holding an open and informed dis
cussion on that matter.
Whether or not minors should 
or should not be printed on diplo
mas is something that needs to be 
openly discussed, said Michael 
Moiseyev, academic affairs commit
tee chair. Theres an attitude from 
the administration that they simply 
know best; they should never dis
count the opinion of students. 
Students were consulted a few years 
ago, and their opinion at the time 
was to remove minors and tracks 
from diplomas. According to Eric 
Grotzinger, associate dean of MCS, 
students and administrators felt 
that the diplomas had become clut
tered, resulting in a less elegant 
appearance. So we decided to 
clean up our diplomas, he said. 
Many peer institutions, said 
Grotzinger, do not list minors and 
tracks on diplomas, including 
Princeton, Georgia Institute of 
Technology, MIT, and New York 
University. Georgetown University 
does not even print majors. A 
diploma essentially tells the world 
you have completed the require
ments for a degree, said Nair. It is 
not meant to detail everything you 
did in that degree. Employers and 
graduate schools look at students 
transcripts, not their diplomas, she 
said.
The bulk of the time I spent 
here, I was working on my track 
requirements, said senior businesss major Nick Mah, who would 
like to see those achievements on 
his diploma. Ryan Anderson, a 
fourth-year architecture major with 
a minor in drama, said he wants to 
see his minor on his diploma, clut
tered or not.Just make the font 
smaller, he said. Get them on 
there.

CMU still negotiating with Qatar
Preventative

SARS at bay

Erin Coulter directed fellow drama majors like senior Audra Blaser, above, in her 
senior thesis show, Crimes of the Heart, in the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre 
this March.Administrators to mull
in the process as A&M, and progress 
has slowed in part because of military 
action in Iraq, said Chris Gabriel, the 
Universitys vice provost for corpo
rate partnership and technology 
development. Gabriel said that any 
commitment to the Foundation will 
come no earlier than this summer.
We are not trying to make a big 
splash yet because we want to make 
sure that on both sides we are going 
to proceed, said Gabriel, who has' 
been coordinating the project.
Gabriel is the liaison between the 
University and every other party con
nected to the project, including the 
Qatar Foundation, Carnegie Mellons 
Board of Trustees, University legal 
counsel, and other universities that 
the Foundation has negotiated with. 
One of the more significant commu
nications Gabriel has established is 
with the University of North Carolina 
(UNC) in Chapel Hill, which was one 
of the Qatar Foundations earlier can
didates to establish a branch business 
school.
The Foundation approached UNC 
in 2000 with a proposal to bring its 
business program to Education City, 
but after a year and a half of discus
sion, UNC and the Foundation could 
not agree on the financial details of a 
branch campus and the project was 
abandoned. Gabriel, the Faculty

As the diplomatic and military 
drama between Iraq and the United 
States has unfolded steadily, another 
Middle Eastern country has also been 
engaged with the United States  
but peacefully, and with exchanges of 
I mutual respect, progressive ideas, 
and careful optimism.
That nation is Qatar, which gradu
ally approaches its grand vision for 
an intellectual mecca of sorts called 
Education City, and which continues 
to attract the support and participa
tion of prominent American universi
ties. Carnegie Mellon is one of those 
universities, and it announced in 
February that it is considering open
ing computer science and business 
programs in Education City, on the 
outskirts of the capital, Doha.
University Provost Mark Kamlet 
made several presentations to the 
Board of Trustees and Faculty Senate 
in February outlining the Universitys 
discussions with the Qatar 
Foundation, a group founded to 
enhance the quality of education in 
and around Qatar. Qatar, a small 
peninsula that juts northward into
the Persian Gulf, is one of the more 
progressive states in the region.
If the plan is carried out, Education 
City would be the only other place 
outside of Pittsburgh that would offer 
a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate 
degree.
Courting Universities
The Qatar Foundation, financed by 
the Emir of Qatar, first brought a col
lege program to Education City in 
1997, when Virginia Commonwealth 
University opened a branch of its 
design school. Since then, the 
Foundation has sought the participa
tion of several other American uni
versities. Cornell University was the 
only other institution to open a 
branch campus; its Weill Medical 
College began its program in 
Education City last September and is 
now finishing its first year.
The Foundation is also in discus
sions with Texas A&M about offering 
programs in electrical, chemical, 
mechanical, and petroleum engineer
ing. The university signed a memo
randum of understanding (MOU) 
with the Qatar Foundation last 
October, and the project was 
endorsed by the Universitys Board of 
Regents on March 28.

Last minute changes in summer 
plans are being made by many of the 
previously Asia-bound students at 
CMU.
With the outbreak of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), stu
dents are hesitant about going to Asia 
to live or visit after school ends.
I dont even know if Im going 
back home yet because of SARS, said 
Mike Cruz, a first-year music major 
from Hong Kong. Maybe Ill take 
summer classes or get a job here.
SARS is an atypical pneumonia 
that first surfaced in Chinas 
Guangdong Province last November.
The cause and cure for this illness 
are both still unknown.
Health officials believe it is a type 
of coronavirus.
Coronaviruses usually cause the 
common cold and respiratory prob
lems in humans.
Symptoms of SARS include a fever 
higher than 100.4- degrees 
Fahrenheit, dry cough, shortness of 
breath, dizziness, and chills, and 
other symptoms similar to those of 
the flu.
According to the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), SARS 
is spread by close person-to-person 
contact.
Most cases involve people who 
cared for or who lived with someone 
with SARS or had direct contact with 
infectious material.
SARS is airborne and can be passed 
along when someone sneezes or 
coughs, leaving droplets of the illness 
in the air.
Doctors recommend that people 
avoid skin contact with those who 
may be infected and abstain from 
then touching their own eyes, nose, 
or mouth.
According to the World Health 
Organization, as of April 19, 2003, 
there have been 3,547 cases of SARS 
and 182 deaths all over the world.
Countries heavily affected by SARS 
include China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
Singapore, Canada, and Vietnam.
The US has had a total of 199 cases 
of SARS, but no deaths.
The illness has also turned up in 
South Africa and India.
Despite the consistently-rising 
number of cases appearing each day, 
some students are skeptical about the 
potential risk of SARS.
I think what we see in newspapers 
is exaggerated, said MBA student 
Peggy T\i.
I talked to my friends, and its not 
as serious as it seems. SARS wont be 
a concern when I go back home to 
China, she said.

As the sun set last Thursday, 
Daniel Gilman sat down with his 
parents to a Seder, bearing news 
that he had just been elected student 
body president with running mate 
Gilbert Dussek. Brian Namey, who 
served as the 2002 - 03 student 
body president with Gilman as his 
vice president, has campaigned for 
his protege for several weeks now, 
and is excited to be handing his title 
to Gilman.
Hes always interested in making 
sure people are being treated fairly. 
Not a lot of people know Dan, 
because hes not a very public figure, 
but Dan does a lot of work behind 
j the scenes, and hes really very effec
tive. I can always trust Dan to go to a 
meeting on my behalf and end up 
with the same result that I could get, 
or a better result, said Namey, 
recalling that even during critical 
moments in Gilmans campaign, 
duty took prevalence over publicity. 
There was a rumor about a security 
incident, and thats all Dan could 
think about, said Namey. We were 
making phone calls and trying to fig
ure out what was going on. He gen
uinely cares about other people.
Gilman, a junior philosophy 
major, was a member and later 
chairperson of Senates committee 
on campus affairs, where he focused 
his time on improving security on 
campus, examining shuttle and 
escort services, and general quality
control. Gilman is also a student 
member of the board of trustees, 
president of the Sigma Phi Epsilon 
fraternity, and a member of the 
University Education Council. 
Elections were held online for the 
second time, though for the first 
time as consolidated elections for all 
student government posts. Senate 
voted to change the constitution at 
the end of Spring 2002 to collapse 
the spring and fall races in an
attempt to build fervor around elec
tions time. Michael Sebetich, elec
tion committee chair and a fifth-year 
H&SS interdisciplinary student, 
gave the verdict on Thursday 
evening, though the tally was slight
ly delayed due to a malfunction in 
the electronic voting system. This 
years race was uneventful, with low 
voter turnout and quiet campaignSee ELECTION, page A5

Marines hand over 
Baghdad to Army
BAGHDAD (AP)  The Marines 
pulled out of Baghdad on Sunday, 
heading south toward new positions 
while U.S. Army units took over their 
former sector. Some soldiers attend
ed Easter services, while Iraqs Shiite 
Muslims revived one of their own 
holy traditions long repressed by 
Saddam Hussein.
Two U.S. congressmen were in 
Syria on Sunday and said President 
Bashar Assad told them his govern
ment will not give asylum to Iraqis 
wanted for war crimes and will expel 
any Iraqis who cross into Syria.
 Reps. Nick Rahall, (D-W. Va.), and 
Darrell Issa, (R-Calif.), were the first 
' American officials to meet Assad 
since the recent escalation of U.S.- 
Syrian tensions.
- U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell 
is due in Syria soon, presumably to 
discuss contentions that Syria spon
sors terrorism and harbors remnants 
of Saddams regime. Rahall and Issa 
depicted Assad as eager to address 
U.S. concerns.
.' Seven thousand miles away, 
President Bush planned to attend 
Easter services with soldiers at Fort 
Hood, TX, then meet with two 
Apache helicopter crewmen who 
were freed a week ago in Iraq.
, The two crewmen were among 
seven former POWs who returned 
home Saturday to a joyous welcome 
from family and well-wishers at Fort 
 Hood and Fort Bliss.
This almost makes me as nervous 
as being shot at, said Chief Warrant 
Officer Ronald D. Young Jr., one of 
the Apache crewmen. We really 
appreciate the support.
At the Vatican, Iraq figured in Pope 
John Paul IIs Easter message to the 
world  he said the Iraqi people, 
aided by other nations, should deter- mine their countrys future.
..Peace in Iraq! proclaimed the 
.pontiff, drawing cheers from a rainsoaked crowd in St. Peters Square. 
With the support of the internation
al community, may the Iraqi people 
become the protagonists of their col
lective rebuilding of their country.
Under the redeployment plan for 
U.S. troops in Iraq, all Marines who 
were in east Baghdad will pull out to 
consolidate in the southern half of 
the country, while Army units will 
control the entire capital and the 
northern half of the country.
The shift will dramatically reduce
the number of American troops in 
Baghdad, although precise figures 
were not released.
Also on Sunday, physicians and 
nurses at Nasiriyas main hospital 
told CNN they defied Iraqi leaders to 
bring food, clothes, and medicine 
from their own limited supplies to 
Army Pfc. Jessica Lynch while she 
was held captive there.
Dr. Ahmed Muhsin said Lynchs 
guards beat her and tried to stop doc
tors from checking her more than 
twice a day. Lynch was rescued in a 
commando raid April 1 and is recu
perating in Washington.
China has jump in 
SARS cases, deaths
BEUING (AP)  Jolted by a jump 
in SARS deaths and a tenfold increase 
in infections in Beijing alone, Chinas 
Communist Party stripped the health 
minister and the capitals mayor of 
power Sunday. It also canceled an 
annual week-long holiday to keep 
millions of people from traveling and 
curb the spread of the disease.
Just hours after announcing 12 
new deaths nationwide, the official 
Xinhua News Agency said Health 
Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing 
Mayor Meng Xuenong were removed 
from their Communist Party posts but 
kept their government titles. The 
reported number of infections in 
Beijing increased from 37 to 346.
The party is the true power in 
China, and Zhangs and Mengs party 
posts were far more important than 
their government offices. Their loss 
left the two men greatiy diminished 
as political figures and possibly fore
shadows their demotion or outright 
ousting from government.
The dismissals came two days after 
President Hu Jintao threatened seri
ous punishment for officials who did
nt quickly and accurately report 
cases of severe acute respiratory syn
drome (SARS).
Last week, Chinese leaders had 
declared fighting SARS a national pri
ority after weeks of criticism that the 
communist government reacted too 
slowly to the mysterious, deadly out
break. The illness is believed to have 
originated in China.
Gao Qiang, an executive vice 
health minister, said the decision to 
cancel the May Day holiday begin
ning May 1 was made to prevent the 
massive movement of people and the 
possible spread of the disease.
He acknowledged that the move 
will mean massive losses in tourism 
revenue, but peoples lives and health 
had to be put above everything.

Bush: N. Korea will 
drop nuke program
FORT HOOD, Texas (AP)  
President Bush said Sunday he 
believes there is a good chance of 
persuading North Korea to end its 
nuclear weapons programs.
He said the United States was 
working with China, Japan, and 
South Korea toward a goal of a 
nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. A 
multilateral approach to the crisis  
rather than the direct U.S.-North 
Korea engagement that Pyongang 
had been demanding  has been key 
to the U.S. strategy.
I believe that all four of us working 
together have a good chance of con
vincing North Korea to abandon her 
ambitions to develop nuclear arse
nals, Bush told reporters after meet
ing at an Army base with two helicop
ters pilots who were held as prisoners 
of war in Iraq.
Plans for U.S.-North Korean talks, 
possibly this week in China, on the 
Norths nuclear weapons program 
were thrown into uncertainty Friday 
after the communist state appeared 
to announce steps that could yield six 
to eight bombs within months.
The confusion about North Koreas 
intentions came days after the State 
Department disclosed plans for talks 
involving the United States, North 
Korea, and China. The developments 
called into question whether the talks 
would go forward.
Bush, asked about the plans, did 
not directly address what will take 
place.
The key thing on the North Korea 
agenda is that China is assuming a 
very important responsibility, Bush 
said. Now that theyre engaged in 
the process, it makes it more likely 
that the countries policy of a nuclearfree Korea will result.
A Bush spokeswoman said after
ward that the presidents reference to 
Chinas involvement should not be
taken as an indication the talks are 
definitely on. Consultations with 
allies in the region continue, deputy 
press secretary Claire Buchan said.
I dont think there has been a deci
sion, she said.
Bushs optimism contrasted with 
another angry pronouncement 
Sunday from North Korea, which said 
South Korea should join it in resisting 
U.S. moves toward war.
Police to investigate 
serial kidnappings
DEWITT, N.Y. (AP)  In a whis
pered phone call from a bottle return 
business, the 16 year old told her sis
ter she was being held captive and 
raped.
The call led police to a weathered, 
blue, ranch-style house, hidden 
behind a wall of 20-foot evergreens 
and fenced off from neighbors.
There, police say, 67-year-old John 
Jamelske, a widower and retired 
handyman with two sons, impris
oned and raped at least four young 
women in a two-room dungeon, 
beginning in the late 1980s, before 
releasing them. The 16 year old had 
been held for six months.
Jamelskes lawyer insists it is not a 
Silence of the Lambs scenario, but 
police are seeking other victims.
During a search of the house, 
deputies said they found photographs 
of women chained to a wall. They 
also say they found diaries Jamelske 
forced his victims to keep, recording 
details such as when they had been 
raped, when they showered, and 
when they brushed their teeth.
He may have been just a handy
man, but he "apparently created his 
own world where he was the ultimate 
ruler, a king, said Dr. Alan Manevitz, 
a psychiatrist at ColumbiaPresbyterian Hospital in New York.
Jamelskes house, with a dented 
car parked on the driveway and a 
rusted flagpole in the front yard, is 
dwarfed by $500,000 homes in this 
affluent community just outside 
Syracuse in central New York.

Library head faces 
felony rap, resigns
PHILADELPHIA (U-WIRE)  
The University of Pennsylvanias 
director of libraries is currently 
under investigation by the 
Philadelphia Police Departments 
Special Victims Unit in a case 
involving child pornography.
Vice Provost and Director of 
Libraries Paul Mosher allegedly 
downloaded more than 2,000 
images of child pornography over 
the Internet and paid for them 
with his credit card, according to 
an unnamed law enforcement offi
cial, The Philadelphia Inquirer

Mosher resigned from his cur
rent position at the University 
Thursday.
The Special Victims Unit investi

and child abuse.
The Daily Pennsylvanian first 
reported on Wednesday that 
Moshers computer had been con
fiscated from his Van Pelt Library 
office on Friday morning, accord
ing to library system staff mem
bers. University spokeswoman Lori 
Doyle confirmed at the time that 
Mosher was the subject of an inves

There is an active investigation 
at the University of Pennsylvania 
into child pornography, said Sgt. 
Roland Lee of the Public Affairs 
Department of the Philadelphia 
Police, adding that no arrest has
been made at this time.
The Special Victims Unit confirmed 
that Mosher is currently under inves

Theres an active investigation 
going, Sgt. Patrick Ghegan said. We 
just cant say anything until its over. 
Ghegan added that the investigation 
could possibly end as early as next 
week.
Possession of child pornography is 
a felony, which carries a sentence of 
three to seven years in jail.
Doyle confirmed Thursday that 
Mosher had resigned from his post. 
On Monday, he had been placed on

all. Because he is seeking to patent 
his product, Ritter did not reveal 
the ingredients he used.
The powder can be dissolved in 
water, and Ritter has developed a 
step-by-step process for drinking 
the solution with meals during a 
period of about five weeks.The 
next four days are a trial period, 
with dairy products added to the 
diet. If the symptoms of gas, diar
rhea, and cramps do not return, 
anything on the menu is fair game.
Taking lactose pills that allow 
the body to digest diary is the most 
common remedy on the market 
today. Pills need to be taken when
ever the diet includes dairy, but 
Ritter said completing his process 
just once makes symptoms disap
pear forever.
Its annoying having to take pills 
wherever you go, said Micol 
Zimmerman, a sophomore major

58 years old and is still taking lac
tate pills. I cant imagine doing 
that.

Family values drive 
Santorums politics
WASHINGTON (AP)  Sen. Rick 
Santorum, a self-described compas
sionate conservative intent on climb
ing the Republican leadership ladder, 
filters all politics and policy through 
one guiding principle: what is best for 
the American family.
Two-parent families, says 
Santorum, are good. Requiring peo
ple to work is good. So is banning 
late-term abortions and giving reli
gion a greater role in government. 
Traditional welfare, on the other 
hand, hurts the family. Homosexual
ity, feminism, and liberalism all 
undermine the family. Even parts of 
the Constitution can harm the family.
If the Supreme Court says that you 
have the right to consensual [gay] sex 
within your home, then you have the 
right to bigamy, you have the right to 
polygamy, you have the right to 
incest, you have the right to adultery. 
You have the right to anything, the 
Pennsylvania lawmaker said in a 
recent interview, fuming over a land
mark gay rights case before the high 
court that pits a Texas sodomy law 
against equality and privacy rights.
All of those things are antithetical 
to a healthy, stable, traditional fami
ly, Santorum said. And thats sort of 
where we are in todays world, unfor
tunately. It all comes from, I would 
argue, this right to privacy that does
nt exist, in my opinion, in the United 
States Constitution. 
The more I got involved, it really 
did open my eyes to how the left had 
destroyed so much, Santorum said.
Santorum is expected to play a 
leading role in trying to win 
Pennsylvania  the nations fifthlargest electoral prize  for President 
Bush in 2004. Bush lost the state in 
2000 by 200,000 votes.
Teenage girl freed 
after parents killed
POCONO LAKE, Pa. (AP)  A 13- 
year-old girl who was abducted after 
a man broke into her familys home 
and killed her parents was released 
unharmed during a police chase 
Sunday morning, authorities said.
Sunday afternoon, FBI agents were 
still trying to negotiate the surrender 
of Robert Lee Hixson, 42, the girls 
uncle, FBI spokeswoman Linda Vizi 
said.
Police chased him after he drove 
through a roadblock near Reading, 
and had him surrounded.
At some point, Hixson stopped the 
car and let her out. She is with the 
police, Vizi said.
Hixson allegedly shot and killed his 
wifes brother, Myron Bilger, and 
Bilgers wife, Ellen, after breaking 
into the familys Pocono Lake home at 
about 9:20 pm Saturday, according to 
police and the FBI.
The couples 5-year-old daughter 
was also home at the time and ran to 
the house of a relative, who then 
alerted authorities, police said. A 
statewide Amber Alert was issued for 
her 13-year-old sister, Hadley.
The girls father identified Hixson 
as the shooter before he died, said 
Pocono Mountain Regional Police 
Detective Harry Lewis.
Looking Ahead
The United States should not 
^ expect to create a functioning 
democracy in Iraq for at least five 
years. The Bush administration start
ed to work very late on a system to 
replace the rule of Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein, ousted with an 
invasion and war. The military plans 
tactics and execution have been bril
liant, said NBCs Meet the Press. 
Similar preparations should have 
been made for what was to come 
afterward, they said.
Rep. Elijah Cummings, who 
^ is chairman of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, 
reproached Republi-cans for cutting 
taxes that disproportionately benefit 
wealthy Americans. If President Bush 
were to succeed in making his 2001 
tax cut permanent, Cummings said, 
then the total benefits going to the 
top 1 percent of the nations taxpay
ers would be more than the size of the 
U.S. Department of Educations budg
et. Bush has proposed a new tax cut 
plan of $726 billion over 10 years. 
Last week, the House approved cuts 
of $550 billion over a decade.

Marines feast on 
Saddams gazelles
TIKRIT, Iraq (AP)  Supper 
time has become a double treat at a 
Marine base outside Saddam 
Husseins hometown  not only is 
there fresh meat, but its from 
Saddams personal hunting pre
serve.
The Tikrit South airfield, where 
Marine Wing Support Squadron 
271 set up base in this weeks cam
paign to take the city, is on the 
edge of a preserve where Saddam 
and favored guests once hunted.
Now, Marines are venturing into 
the woods to hunt the animals, 
which stand about waist-high. 
They haul back the carcasses as a 
welcome substitute for the 
prepackaged Meals Ready to Eat 
that have been their staple.
It was delicious. I dont know if 
its because weve been eating 
MREs for two months, but every
ones enjoyed it a lot, said Cpl. 
Joshua Wicksell, 26, of Texas.
Wicksells review may be biased 
 hes the cook, and has been put
ting his culinary arts degree to 
good use in an unexpected setting.
Each of the squadrons platoons 
has been limited to killing one 
gazelle a day to make sure the herd 
isnt depleted.
The marines are using 9mm pis
tols to hunt after initially being for
bidden to use firearms for fear that 
gunshots in the woods might be 
mistaken for enemy fire.
We hunted them with rocks, as 
Stone Age as that sounds, 
Wicksell said. We gutted them
and skinned them and pretty much 
carried them over our shoulders 
barbarian-style.
The preparation is almost as 
primitive: a fire pit dug in the 
ground, covered by a radiator grill 
from one of the Marines trucks.
Wicksell tenderizes the meat 
with a fork and rubs in salt, pep
per, sugar, and seasonings scav
enged from MREs.
To cut the meats gaminess, he 
adds some juice from oranges, 
which have started coming to the 
Marines now that supply lines are 
secure.
The ambiance lacks a lot and the 
diners dress is less than chic, but 
participants nonetheless feel a 
touch of elegance because of the 
meats fine quality.
14 animals found 
dead on ball field
FREMONT, Ohio (AP)  
Fourteen dead animals were found 
on a Ross High School softball 
field by an assistant coach.
The bodies of skunks, raccoons, 
rabbits, cats, and a groundhog 
were placed in positions that play
ers would take on the field, school 
athletic director Art Bucci said.
The gates to the schools fields 
were locked when the coach made 
the discovery Friday, and police 
found no signs of forced entry.
The team found its cars covered 
in toilet paper and shaving cream 
upon returning from a game at 
Lima on Thursday night, police 
reports show. Bucci believes it was 
a prank by other students.
Fremont is about 30 miles 
southeast of Toledo.

Researchers unveil 
new wireless space
Carnegie Mellon researchers Asim 
Smailagic and Dan Siewiorek, with 
students from their Rapid 
Prototyping of Computer Systems 
class, will demonstrate a new wire
less meeting space designed to save 
time and money for businesses at 
1:30 pm April 30 in room 2202 of 
Hamburg Hall.
The interactive physical and digital 
workspace supports collaborative 
project teams by providing the digital 
equivalent of dedicated project 
rooms. These new smart rooms can 
store important computer files, rec
ognize meeting participants, and pro
vide unlimited security for sensitive 
research data.
At the flip of the switch, businesses 
can now turn any room into an infor
mation crossroads where a variety of 
digital tools and novel interactive 
devices can support seamless group 
collaborations from anywhere in the 
world. This includes Hong Kong, 
where business trade is off because of 
the deadly virus severe acute respira
tory syndrome (SARS).
And because public health officials 
think SARS is spread by close contact 
between people, executives are seek
ing new ways to conduct business, 
including increased use of the phone 
and teleconferencing, Carnegie 
Mellon researchers said.
Our powerful... tools permit users 
to organize, retrieve, store, and share 
information from multiple modes of 
collaboration, said Smailagic, a prin
ciple research scientist with Carnegie 
Mellons Institute for Complex 
Engineered Systems.
Some of the digital tools include 
specially-designed computer boards, 
remote interactive devices, and spe
cial 3-D audio systems for improved 
presentation of meeting information 
and knowledge transfer.
This project supports the nomadic
character of todays business environ
ment where mobile extension sup
ports remote collaboration, said 
Smailagic, who won the prestigious 
Carnegie Science Center Award this 
month for innovative work in infor
mation technology.

Flaws hurt chance 
of human cloning
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
Scientists may have been able to 
create Dolly the sheep, but 
researchers at Pitt have found it 
nearly impossible to create a clone 
of Dolly Parton.
Researchers at the University of 
Pittsburgh Development Center at 
the Magee-Womens Research 
Institute have found that funda
mental flaws in embryonic devel
opment may make therapeutic 
cloning of non-human primates 
difficult and reproducing both 
human and non-human primates 
impossible.
Their study, which was funded 
by the National Institute of Child 
Health, the National Center for 
Research Resources, the National 
Institute of Environmental Health 
Sciences, and private philanthro
pies, was published last week in 
the journal Science.
In therapeutic cloning, scientists 
stimulate limited cell division in an 
unfertilized egg cell to produce 
embryonic stem cells. These cells 
can later differentiate into differ
ent types of body tissue.
Reproductive cloning involves 
scientists injecting a donor nucleus 
into an egg cell and then implanti
ng that egg into a living surrogate 
female to create pregnancy.
Gerald Schatten, director of the 
PDC and vice chairman and profes
sor in Pitts Obstetrics, Gynecology, 
Reproductive Sciences, and Cell 
Biology Departments, used nuclear 
transfer methods on 724 eggs 
retrieved from female rhesus mon
keys. Nuclear transfer involves tak
ing the nucleus from a somatic, or 
body, cell and inserting it into an 
egg without a nucleus. The nuclear 
transferring process causes the 
new cell to exhibit the properties of 
the donor'nucleus.
Though 33 of the embryos pro
duced through nuclear transfer 
were implanted into female mon
keys after initial cell division, no 
pregnancies occurred. Scientists, 
when examining images of DNA 
and cell structure, found that, 
while cell division occurred in a 
superficially normal manner, each 
individual cell had chromosomal 
problems.
We used antibodies to tag the
cell proteins and DNA so that we 
could track progress, said Calvin 
Simerly, associate professor of obstet
rics, gynecology, and reproductive 
sciences at Pitt and the papers first 
author. When cells divide, there are 
very basic things that are supposed to 
happen, and they just didnt happen.
Christopher Navara, another 
researcher, explained that many of 
these cloning difficulties are because 
of missing motor proteins, which 
form the mitotic spindle in the cells. 
The mitotic spindle is the structure in 
a cell responsible for organizing DNA 
prior to cell division and then sepa
rating chromosomes and the result
ing daughter cells during division. 
This separation is necessary for the 
cell to be able to replicate itself suc
cessfully.
Navara added that during the 
cloning of non-human primates, sci
entists remove the DNA and conse
quently take about 5 to 10 percent of 
the egg in the process. In non-human 
primates, many of those motor pro
teins are collected around the DNA, 
so they are often removed along with 
that DNA.
When examining cells that were 
formed using nuclear transfer tech
niques, researchers found that spin
dles had unequal chromosome counts 
and chaotic structures. Without a suf
ficient amount of motor proteins, the 
mitotic spindle does not form proper
ly, which causes some of the daughter 
cells to have abnormal numbers of 
chromosomes.
Navara explained that motor pro
teins are evenly distributed through
out the egg.
Pitt student dies in 
motorcycle crash
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  At 
some time between 1:30 and 1:45 pm 
Tuesday, Pitt sophomore Shane 
Schulte was in his hometown of 
Bethel Park doing what he loved 
most: taking a ride on his motorcycle.
Motorcycle riding  that was his 
favorite thing, said Chuck Schulte, 
his father.
Shane, a mechanical engineering 
student with a love for sports and life 
in general, never returned from the 
ride. He was involved in an accident, 
which claimed his life.
Bethel Park officials could not com
ment on the accident but said there 
were other vehicles involved.
Schulte is the second Pitt student 
to die this term. Justin Vandora died 
in early January when he was hit by a 
bus near Pitt's campus.

Alcohol, 4/12/03, 5:36 pm 
Officers on patrol observed persons 
drinking beer on the Sigma Nu fra
ternity porch. They observed an 
empty beer can being thrown onto 
the Morewood Avenue side lawn. As 
the officers exited their vehicle and 
approached the house, all the peo

Exam rules 
may curb 
crammingry boards recommendations are 
confidential, per policy. Following 
the review, the president, provost, 
dean, and department head meet to 
discuss the recommendations, and 
the department head composes a 
formal response to the board. This 
response letter, also presented to the 
Board of Trustees, dictates initia
tives to be undertaken by related 
administration and faculty, with 
progress to be reported to the board 
at the beginning of the next adviso
ry cycle.
William Elliot, vice president of 
enrollment for over three decades, 
said that in the 90s, Mehrabians 
presidential administration put 
increased emphasis on undergradu
ate education at CMU. Under 
Mehrabian, CMU established the 
Eberly Center for Teaching 
Excellence, permeated the Advisory 
Council system throughout the 
University, and established the 
office of the vice provost for educa
tion. CMUs history credits 
Mehrabian with renewed empha
sis on undergraduate education, 
signaled by the vice provost appoint
ment. He succeeded Richard Cyert 
who was recognized for molding 
CMU into a national research 
University.
Jed Harris, senior lecturer of 
directing, learned of the recommen
dation regarding the directing pro
gram during a drama faculty meet
ing that included University 
President Jared Cohon. Harris said 
the previous Board made a similar 
recommendation five years ago, but 
a rejoinder from the faculty, includ
ing himself, retired the issue. It was 
discussed and we pretty much made 
our case and the issue was 
dropped, said Harris. He noted that 
today the undergraduate directing 
major is often the first thing to go 
from a drama school, with the trend 
in directing education moving to a 
classical education followed by a 
post-graduate fine arts degree 
(MFA) in directing, as opposed to a 
bachelors fine arts degree (BFA). 
CMU is part of a dwindling minority 
of conservatories to offer a BFA in 
directing. [The directing faculty] 
are taking it in stride ... weve sort of 
been there before, said Harris, who 
received his BFA in directing from 
CMU.
Elizabeth Bradley, head of the 
School of Drama in 2002, said there 
is a lot of discussion to be had before 
any decisions will be made. My 
opinion at the moment is we have a 
program that has worked well for a 
number of students, said Bradley. 
There is a lot of fact-finding to be 
done. Bradley said many consider

A new exam policy, which went into 
effect February 28, includes in-term 
exams as well as finals.
Vito Fiore, senate chair, said it puts 
more power in the hands of students.
You just walk around campus and 
you hear students who are over
whelmed and upset with their schedule. 
Things all come up at once, and this 
essentially protects against that, he 
said. It allows you to have more flexi
bility.
Under the new policy, students are 
not required to take more than two 
exams in one day.
This applies to in-term exams as well, 
not just finals.
Exams can never be given on week
ends, and professors are discouraged 
from scheduling exams outside of class 
time.
In some classes, exams simply cant 
be completed in one hour.
The exam policy, as a compromise, 
now says that a professor can put an 
exam outside of class time if it is specifi
cally to give students more time to take 
the exam, said Michael Moiseyev, chair 
of the academic affairs committee. If 
exams are scheduled outside of class 
time, professors must accommodate stu
dents with time restraints, not the other 
way around.
Its all about students time being 
respected, said Fiore.
Projects cannot be due on the last day 
of class if that class has a final. 
According to Moiseyev, this policy 
allows students to focus on one task at a 
time.
Assignments and exams that are 
replacing the final cannot be given dur
ing the final time.
The final times should be just about 
the finals, said Fiore.
In other news, the University 
Education Council decided on April 14 
that the administration would no longer 
pursue changing final grades to include 
plus/minus grading.
Moiseyev said this is a victory for stu
dents.
There continues to be pressure from 
both sides, and certain members of the 
administration want to see plus/minus 
grades, he said. But at this point, it 
seems the top members of the adminis
tration dont want to go against students 
on this.

A mother and children prevent exposure to SARS in an airport in Hong Kong a few weeks ago. The photo was taken by 
Enoch Chan, E-commerce 01, whose trip travelling all over Asia left him afraid he could have been exposed to SARS. 
Chan had quarantined himself inside his apartment for ten days, leaving only to shop for groceries, until two weeks ago.
SARS keeps CMU students in Pittsburgh
said. Classes were canceled. Even 
now, kindergarteners to university 
students are on break.
Traveling was also a different 
experience for Chan. According to 
Chan, when checking in at the air
port in Asia, he had to fill out a 
SARS symptom questionnaire. If 
people reported that they had at 
least one of the symptoms, they 
were kept from boarding the air
plane.
Flight attendants were wearing 
masks, and they handed them out to 
those who didnt have one, he said.
In the U.S., they handed out 
information sheets that told us to 
monitor ourselves [for] any symp
toms.
The constant media coverage and 
mounting number of SARS cases has 
caused some wariness among stu
dents at Carnegie Mellon, but 
Health Services has not confirmed a 
single case on campus.
Weve probably had ten students 
come into health services concerned 
that they might have SARS, said 
Anita Barkin, the director of Health 
Services.
We examined them for a fever 
and respiratory distress. If, across 
the board, they dont have the symp
toms, they dont fit the case defini
tion of SARS. For all we know, they 
could be allergy symptoms.
SARS, from page A1A representative from the 
Infectious Diseases branch of the 
Allegheny County Health 
Department (ACHD) said that they 
receive numerous phone calls every
day.
Because there are many corpora
tions, universities, and health cen
ters in the Pittsburgh area, theres a 
large traveling and aging population 
that is concerned, she said.
According to the ACHD, there 
have been no reported cases in 
Allegheny County.
Those students who are not 
returning home for the summer will 
be able to obtain campus housing if 
needed, said Director of Housing 
Tim Michael.
Students undaunted by SARS will 
fly to Asia after their last final.
Taiwan is pretty good about pro
tecting the people from SARS, said 
Jason Chen, a junior IS major. Im 
not worried about going home.
For other students, its not SARS 
thats preventing them from return
ing home, but the fact that the envi
ronment will be different.
Therell be nothing to do in Hong 
Kong, said Chavelli Tusi, a sopho
more design major.
The malls, clubs, and bars are 
going to be closed; no ones going to 
be going to those places. Ill proba
bly travel in the U.S. or Europe.
My parents in Hong Kong dont 
know anyone with SARS, said 
Cruz. But there are two dads from 
my high school that have SARS and 
theyre okay.
They are only two people out of 
1,200 families from my school.
The CDC suggests two ways to 
prevent the spread of the illness: 
isolation and quarantine.
It recommends that people with 
SARS isolate themselves in hospitals 
or designated health centers while 
receiving treatment.

resources than they would have at 
the Qatar campus.
Committee members agree on this 
point, but it is not without its own 
problems. For example, if Qatari stu
dents came to Pittsburgh early in 
their college careers, they would be 
able to acclimate to Carnegie 
Mellons style of education, and hit 
the ground running when they 
returned to Qatar.
But at the same time, having stu
dents come to Pittsburgh later in 
their career would allow them to 
develop gradually in the Education 
City system, and then come to 
Pittsburgh when they were ready to 
take full advantage of what the 
Pittsburgh campus has to offer.
Im thinking that there should be 
at least one early semester while they 
are here, said Nair. One worry 
though is that if they do not calibrate 
their students then they will not be 
ready to come to our campus. 
Ultimately, Nair hopes that the 
efforts of Carnegie Mellon and other 
schools will be thorough enough to 
help Qatar and the Qatar Foundation 
to fully develop a center of educa
tion.
I really admire the Qatar 
Foundation for starting it there 
because a lot of people ask if they 
really want to train their students, 
why dont you just ship a whole 
bunch of students here, said Nair. 
But they know that having a home 
institution is the right thing to do.
The expectation, then, is for the 
Qatar branch to eventually develop 
its own programs to bring back to the 
Pittsburgh campus and aid at 
Carnegie Mellon in its continuing 
efforts to spread its impact as widely 
as possible. Im hoping that this will 
in turn strengthen our international 
relations program, said Nair. That 
is my hope: that we can not just stay 
isolated in the Education City but be 
able to talk to people at the Qatar 
University and see people who teach 
there also.
during the initial presentations by 
Kamlet, and economics and public 
policy professor Robert Strauss pre
pared some cautionary words and 
suggestions for the Faculty Senate 
and the planners.
According to the notes Strauss pre
pared for the meeting, he advised 
that Carnegie Mellon consider, 
among other things, the security 
risks of sending University personnel 
into the middle of a volatile region.
We have to think about safety, 
said Cofield. Its not like going to 
Canada.
There are also questions about 
how faculty will work between the 
two campuses. Some professors have 
expressed interest in the program, 
which would require two or threeyear committments to teaching in 
Qatar. We have to think of our facul
ty going there, but then we have to 
have them teach here too. We have to 
make sure that our staffing is in no 
way perturbed because of this, said 
Nair. Perhaps the most serious ques
tion that faculty have asked is about 
reports that the Qatar government 
has aided a senior member of AlQaeda. Kamlet told the Senate mem
bers that the question was already 
part of their investigation into the 
advisability of the Qatar campus.
said, While were not doing it for the 
money, we certainly wouldnt do it if 
there wasnt a substantial amount of 
money involved. And this would be a 
substantial amount of money. I just 
say that directly upfront.
The most compelling prospect for 
the committee, however, is that 
through collaborating with the 
Qatari government, the University 
could be sowing the seeds for future 
productive relationships between the 
West and the Middle East.
The exchange of educational sys
tems and ideals could represent one 
of the necessary bridges that one day 
lead to peace in a perpetually tumul
tuous region.
The thing that attracted me most 
to this was President Cohon saying 
that this will really be a movement in 
the direction of peace rather than 
war, said Nair. That is extremely 
important to me ... War is settling a 
conflict without understanding and 
peace  real peace can only come 
when there is true understanding.
This is a wonderful thing, said 
Gabriel. Regardless of what the 
Bush Administration wanted to do 
with diplomacy to encourage Arab 
nations into peace, what were trying 
to do to create a quality education is 
more beneficial for this effort.
It is such a tempting plan that 
some professors have expressed 
interest solely because of the possi
bility of fostering the beginnings of 
understanding.
The impact on peace in the 
Middle East and bridging a cultural 
divide ends up being surprisingly 
attractive to some faculty members, 
said Lee. Ive already had encoun
ters with CS professors saying that 
just on this basis they would want to 
go. Some faculty really care deeply 
about this.
The project is already immensely 
complex, and if the University even
tually does commit seriously to the 
project  to establishing a foreign 
program that encourages education, 
and possibly understanding, in the 
Middle East  the committee mem
bers know what they will have to 
accomplish.
How do you create that kind of 
environment? Lee said. Its going to 
be a huge challenge.
Admissions Standards
Administrators want the students 
that would attend the branch campus 
in Education City to be of the same 
caliber as Carnegie Mellon students.
We want to be very deliberate, 
that admissions standards are the 
same and that students are as smart 
[as they are at CMU], said Gabriel.
Again, the difficulty of establish
ing admission standards is com
pounded by the committees lack of 
interaction with potential students.
I havent seen [a Qatari student], 
said Nair. And probably theyre not a 
whole lot different.... It still feels 
strange to be working in a vacuum 
without having seen a real student. 
Nair added that the committee 
needs to learn about the high school 
curriculum in Qatar and how it 
relates to a high school education in 
the United States.
The Carnegie Mellon Experience
Among its numerous challenges, 
the curriculum committee needs to 
divine what a Carnegie Mellon 
experience is and somehow export a 
translated version of it to Qatar. Lee 
emphasizes that an undergraduate 
education through the University 
needs more than vocational training 
in a certain field.
[An undergraduate education is] 
about learning and becoming a full 
adult and member in society. Its 
about developing certain core values 
and the ability to learn for the rest of 
your life .... All of that is very impor
tant for whatever we might be 
doing, said Lee.
To aid this developmental process, 
the committee hopes to bring stu
dents from the Qatar campus to 
Pittsburgh for a semester sometime 
during the school year or the sum
mer. The purpose would be to give 
the Qatari students a chance to get 
the full university experience, while 
giving them more opportunities and
A Compelling Project
While the committee sees plenty of 
potential problems for the project, 
they cannot avoid thinking about the 
practical benefits the Universitys 
involvement could bring.
On the curriculum committee, the 
motivation for this project is multi
faceted.
The University will receive a signif
icant sum of money from the 
Foundation for contributing a branch 
campus, and all operating and devel
opment expenses would be covered.
Cofield referred to some kind of 
significant financial benefit that 
Carnegie Mellon would receive if the 
Education City campus came to 
fruition. Cornell University was 
promised $750 million for the Weill 
Medical college project, according to 
the Cornell Daily Sun.

Faculty Senate in February, Kamlet

H&SS policy limits tight registration
by Nick Ennis
Assistant Forum Editor
This fall, a new policy will more 
strictly regulate class registration in 
H&SS, in an attempt to curb course 
shopping by its students. Students 
wishing to schedule more than 50 
units of classes must now seek 
approval both from their academic 
advisors and from Joseph Devine, 
H&SS associate dean. The H&SS 
College Council, made up of Devine, 
department heads, faculty mem
bers, and undergraduate and gradu
ate students, approved the policy 
with little opposition earlier this 
month. The greatest concern among 
members was that the policy change 
could prevent some students from 
obtaining double majors and/or 
minors. In addition to the increased 
oversight from H&SS administra
tors, the minimum QPA to qualify 
for overloading will rise from 3.00 to 
3.50, and a normal course load will 
now be 50 units instead of 51. 
Students will no longer automatical
ly register for extra units online, and 
the QPA requirement will be strictly 
enforced. Each college determines 
its own definition of a normal course 
load. The electrical and computer 
engineering department in CIT 
already requires students to have a 
3.50 QPA in order to overload. Last 
fall, 35 percent of H&SS students 
qualified to overload. Of those, near
ly half finished the semester with 
more than 51 units. With the new 
policy, only 20 percent of those stu
dents would now qualify. According 
to Devine, faculty members and 
department heads have discussed 
the repercussions of overloading for 
several years. There have been 
concerns that the workload is 
demanding just with a normal 
course load, he said. Through their 
department heads, faculty members 
have long told the Council their stu
dents are stretched too thin between 
many courses. As a result, some stu
dents are unable to participate in 
class. Professors have also com
plained about the number of stu
dents who drop courses several 
weeks after the start of the semester. 
Despite these concerns, students 
from other Colleges will still be able 
to overload into H&SS courses. If 
people from outside the College are 
still spreading thin, this will high
light the problem with overloading, 
said Devine. He recently presented 
his research on this subject to the 
National Academic Advising 
Association using Carnegie Mellon 
as a case study. Although most stu
dents who take only one extra 
course do not see a decline in 
grades, he said that students often 
forgo sleep and extracurricular 
activities to manage course work. To 
him, this is not beneficial to the stu
dents. Fifth-year senior Lara Panis 
spoke at the presentation in support 
of the policy. Skipping readings, 
opting not to participate in class dis
cussions, and having a weak grasp of 
the material were all consequences 
of taking six [or more] classes, she 
said. David Kaufer, head of the 
English department and a supporter 
of the new policy, said the policy 
does not deny students the right to 
overload but instead ensures that 
they receive advice before doing so. 
I believe students should focus as 
much as they can, said Kaufer. 
There needed to be more regula
tion [of overloading].
Kaufer, however, did not give the 
English advisors any special advice 
on approving requests for overloads. 
History junior Rick Smith is strongly 
against the new policy. Having 
transferred from CIT, he needs to 
overload each semester to graduate 
on time. He meets regularly with his 
advisor, who did not recommend 
overloading. I also prioritize my 
assignments...if anything else still
needs to be done, I stay up to do it. It 
never takes past 1:30 am at the 
worst, he said. In an email sent to 
all H&SS students on April 11, 
Devine wrote that the aim of the pol
icy is to allow students the time for 
course content mastery as welLas 
personal reflection on and integra
tion of knowledge that makes for 
successful intellectuals, profession
als, and citizens.
I think putting the overload at 50 
units is a great idea, it might force 
people to take some time off, said 
sophomore history major Sarah 
Steers. Devine has not delineated a 
set of criteria by which overload 
requests will be judged. Instead, he 
plans to approve requests on an indi
vidual basis. Students will have to 
explain the reasoning behind their 
request and why it is necessary to 
their studies. Several accelerated 
masters programs at the Heinz 
School require students to take up to 
66 units. Overload requests related 
to these programs will be approved. 
Devine does not anticipate that class 
sizes will decrease as a result of the 
policy, but he does expect fewer stu
dents to be placed on waiting lists 
because shopping for classes will 
be harder. Without a similar policy 
in place for the University to use as a 
guide, Devine says the College will 
have to gauge the policys effective
ness and make changes as necessary 
to reach its goals. Indira Nair, vice 
provost for education, supports the 
new H&SS policy. While an advisor 
in the Engineering and Public Policy 
department, she required all stu
dents to meet with her two times per 
semester and discouraged overload
ing. To Nair, perspective, empathy, 
and self-knowledge are three impor
tant aspects of education that stu
dents must obtain themselves. .
The policy is one attempt to free 
time for [self-reflection] rather than 
shackle [students], as it may seem, 
she said.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 21, 2003 5
Host Todd Newton
Gilman, Dussek win Student Body election
ELECTION from page Al
ing. The elections committee tallied 
eight hand-written votes and 1,616 
electronic ones, though last years 
student body presidency race 
brought over 2000 students to the 
voting booth.
Last year, there was actually a 
race. This year, the candidates were a 
lot more passive, said Mary Kosinski, 
a senior chemistry and policy major 
and member of the elections commit
tee, who previously served as Senate 
chair.
Gilman pointed to the new sched
uling as an elections buzz kill.
Last year, the elections were 
before Carnival, Buggy, Passover, 
Easter, everything. People got dis
tracted this year from the debate, 
said Gilman, saying that he would 
have liked to have run a more active 
campaign and to have had the chance 
to talk to more constituents prior to 
the election. With the elections over 
and summer on the way, Gilman is 
feeling fine about life.
Im so thankful for the opportuni
ty that the student body has given me 
for next year, and Im excited for the 
great gains we can make together to 
improve student life, said Gilman.
Gilman and Dussek will be officially 
stepping into their new positions on 
Wednesday, April 30, directly follow
ing the school years final Senate 
meeting.
Were right in the middle of a lot 
of big stuff right now, so well proba
bly just step in and carry on with 
what were already doing. Like the 
PAT transit issue, said Gilman, who 
will be meeting with Gene Riccardi, 
the president of City Council, next 
week to lobby for increased bus traf
fic to and from the Oakland area. 
After that, the new president and vice 
president say they will focus on get
ting the student body ready for grad
uation and the end of the year, as 
well as preparing for next falls orien
tation and the influx of new fresh
men.
Student Senate will vote on the 
count to confirm it, but preliminary 
results show that Quinten Steenhuis, 
a junior philosophy major, with run
ning mate Kirstin Connors, a masters 
electrical and computer engineering 
major, came in second at 24.01 per
cent, and Ben Hackett and Colin 
Holloway won 12.72 percent of the 
vote.
Michael Moiseyev and David 
Romberger pulled in 6.91percent,
and William Guzy got 2.05 percent. 
As of press time, Gilman and Dussek, 
a junior ECE and biomedical engi
neering student, won the race with 
47 percent of the vote.
I think Steenhuis would have been 
a good president. Hes really dedicat
ed and cares about what he does. I 
would have liked to see him be presi
dent, but so it goes, said Vikrm 
Manjunath, a senior computer sci
ence major. I really would have 
liked to see Moiseyev win, because I 
feel hes closer to the student body, 
along with David Romberger. Theyre 
stand-up guys, said John Field, 
junior material science and engineer
ing major. Gilman, in my opinion, 
really only got elected because of the 
mass name-recognition he achieved 
through being Nameys vice presi
dent last year.
Dussek acknowledged Nameys 
help gratefully, but said that he and 
Gilman have individual connections 
to the student body that will only 
grow stronger.
I believe a lot of people feel were 
very approachable ... were very wellintegrated into campus through our 
respective organizations, he said. 
People know us because were 
involved.
PAT may raise prices again this year

during PATs recent budget crisis.
There is no question that the cur
rent arrangement is a beneficial one 
for the campus community. We will 
need to be open to some fee increase 
that is greater than inflation so long 
as we can ensure service levels,otest 
said Murphy.
The University of Pittsburgh is cur
rently in negotiation with PAT as 
their contract ends in August. Their 
success will be key to the success of 
CMUs negotiation next year, espe
cially if both universities ridership 
stays high enough to keep services 
active.
This year, Carnegie Mellon paid 
the Port Authority $612,900, and 
Carnegie Mellon ridership is project
ed to hit 1.1 million, according to 
Murphy.
With service cuts possible, admin
istration and student government 
members have started to effect plans 
to lobby legislators to restore or pos
sibly increase the budgets for the Port 
Authority and other public transit 
agencies around the commonwealth. 
One group, Save Our Transit, was in 
Harrisburg on Tuesday to lobby 
members of the General Assembly.
It is possible that a similar trip will
be scheduled for CMU students, 
along with a letter-writing campaign 
being started by the Graduate 
Student Assembly.
Alik Widge, vice president for 
external affairs and a doctoral com
puter science student, realizes that 
the fare increases and service cuts are 
not necessarily the fault of the Port 
Authority.
With service already far below 
demand, the agency cannot cut any 
more routes or scheduled runs on 
any line without making the short
age worse.
Afternoon rush-period buses are far 
beyond capacity once they reach 
Oakland, and fewer buses cannot 
improve that situation.
If Governor Rendell rejects the 
increase, the Port Authority will have 
to start its new fiscal year $20 million 
over budget, and it cannot operate at 
current levels with that funding.
Namey, Widge, and Student Body 
Vice President Dan Gilman are set to 
meet with City Council this week, 
and students are encouraged to 
attend relevant city and Port 
Authority meetings, including the 
public hearings required to cut 
routes, which are set for May 21.

As plans to decrease service on the 
Port Authority Transit system contin
ue to be implemented, local groups 
have started to counter the funding 
cuts in Harrisburg and the service 
cuts locally.
Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh both main
tain a relationship with the Port 
Authority in the form of five-year 
contracts for unlimited service. Now 
reaching the end of the fourth year of 
the contract, University officials are 
looking forward to renegotiating 
next summer.
Under the current setup, which is 
operated for the University by Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy, 
the Port Authority has had the right 
to raise fares 3 percent for inflation 
each year plus or minus 5 percent as 
an adjustment.
For the first two years of the agree
ment, from 1998 until 2000, the fee 
charged by the Port Authority for the 
agreement did not increase.
In the last two years, it has been 
raised the full 8 percent both years

Human genome 
sequence complete
On Monday, civilization took one 
great leap towards understanding 
how the human body works. The 
International Human Genome 
Sequencing Consortium (the U.S. 
along with the National Human 
Genome Research Institute and the 
Department of Energy contributing), 
announced that the Human Genome 
Project was completed, nearly two 
years ahead of schedule.
A similar announcement was made 
before in 1999. This sequencing was 
more of an outline than a solid work. 
Since then, scientists from all over the 
world have worked to fill in the gaps 
that were left and to verify the accu
racy of the areas that have been 
found. The current version has fewer 
than one error per 10,000 base pairs, 
and all gaps are in areas whose con
tents cannot be reliably determined 
with todays tools. Additionally, the 
project ran under expected costs by 
$300 million (fiscal year 1991, when 
the project began).
All data found have been placed in 
the public domain, with no cost to 
redistribute or use. It has already 
been put to use by some pharmaceu
tical companies and disease 
researchers. When the project began, 
scientists found fewer than 100 genes 
that could cause disease if defective. 
Currently, there are almost 15 times 
as many that have been identified.

Global Positioning Systems - in a tacti
cal sense, they are the glue which holds 
much of todays military together, turn
ing the battlespace into a latticework of 
interconnected targets. All told, the 
U.S. unveiled close to two dozen re
worked or brand-new pieces of 
weaponry in Operation: Iraqi Freedom. 
The idea was to overwhelm an under
whelming force. The Iraqi army was 
quickly overcome by a combination of 
staggering firepower from the air and a 
relentless ground attack. The result 
was a reduction in actual fighting time 
versus the 1991 conflict (about 26 
days) in addition to the lives of coali
tion forces saved by the wars limited 
fighting (close to 150). The point, 
CENTCOM commanders emphasized, 
was not to reproduce the arbitrary 
killing seen in the final days of Desert 
Storm, but to get American and coali
tion soldiers back home as quickly as 
possible. With the war over and the 
rebuilding of Iraq now beginning, it 
appears the improved lethality, 
response time, and overall might of our 
new technologies have done precisely 
that.
First, a taste of the future. In terms of 
munitions, the U.S. military has rolled 
out several steady improvements in the
past decade or so, including some new 
ones since Operation Enduring 
Freedom, the 2001 campaign to oust 
Afghanistans Taliban ruling party. New 
types of precision-guided weapons 
include the Massive Ordinance Airburst 
Bomb, popularly known as MOAB or 
Mother of All Bombs, and E-bombs, 
electromagnetic pulse-emitters deliv
ered by cruise missiles. Though their 
time in action was limited by capacity, 
both munitions were intended for psy
chological effects on the enemy. One 
MOAB arrived at a forward operating 
base inside Iraq on April 10 but was not 
sacrificed; the E-bomb, which sends 
out a lightning bolt of solid-state-dis
rupting energy, affecting television, 
radio, and communications sites on a 
citywide scale, may not have been 
employed due to battle goals set on pro
tecting infrastructure. The 21,000- 
pound MOAB, 18,000 pounds of which 
is explosive material, was first tested at 
Floridas Eglin Air Force Base, in what 
some military analysts were calling the 
opening volley of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. It replaced the 15,000-pound 
Daisy Cutter, a Vietnam-era ballistic 
that explodes above ground after being 
dropped from high altitudes, and 
became the single largest conventional
bomb in U.S. history. E-bombs have 
never before been used in war and just 
recently emerged from development, 
according to an official Army 
spokesman who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. They are capable of neu
tralizing electrical equipment upon det
onation, sending approximately five 
million watts of microwave energy into 
the atmosphere that can knock out 
broad swaths of circuits and wiring in a 
single flash. Hard-to-reach command 
and control stations were initially cited 
as possible targets for the bombs, but 
CENTCOM has not confirmed or 
denied that such weapons were used. 
In subsequent battle scenarios, howev
er, the piggy-backed E-bomb may soon 
become the weapon de rigeur for 
urban-based command and control dis
ruption. Other first-time gadgets 
include sensor-fused weapons that 
release armor-piercing clay pigeons 
which scan the battlefield using 
infrared sensors and lock onto heavy 
vehicle and troop targets over a 30-acre 
area; and thermobaric weapons (used 
sparingly in Afghanistan but on a wider 
scale in Iraq), laser-guided bombs 
dropped from aircraft such as die F-15E 
Strike Eagle, intended to blast hard-toreach spots like tunnels or cayes.
Alexander Meseguer/Science & Technology Editor
One of the biggest developments 
since the first Gulf War has been the 
extent to which the military has 
increasingly relied upon satellites to 
guide its munitions. Joint Direct Attack 
Munitions (JDAM) are perfect exam
ples of military testing and develop
ment responding to limitations in the 
field. As employment capability went, 
Operation Desert Storm revealed some 
of the shortcomings of existing laserguidance systems. Earlier precisionguided systems had trouble navigating 
inclement weather, often falling short 
of their target when confronted with 
sandstorms, clouds, or dust. JDAMs, 
which were dropped by Air Force and 
Navy warplanes during Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, use satellite coordinates 
found in GPS kits on the bombs in 
order to improve their accuracy. The 
operational testifig conducted on the 
weapons in 1998: through 1999 found 
that of 450 bombs dropped, 95 percent 
were accurate to within 9 meters, 
according to the U.S. Navy Fact File. 
Stack this against only a few years ago, 
when the war in Kosovo featured guid
ance systems that produced explosions 
sometimes hundreds of feet off target.

Pixar president lectures on 
animation and teamwork

Copy Manager
Pixar president Ed Catmulls lecture, 
titled Creativity and Technology, 
drew so many that a separate room 
was allotted to accommodate those 
who could not squeeze themselves 
into the cramped Wean 7500 lecture 
hall.
Those in the overflow room got a 
televised look at Catmull while he 
spoke about his studio, projects, and 
philosophies. Good animators, 
Catmull said, are very observant; great 
animators, however, can add that 
small something extra that really 
brings a character or a scene together.
[Animators] are very dedicated 
people who think a great deal about 
what they do and how to get there, 
Catmull said. On their own, however, 
animators cannot complete a film of 
the size and quality produced by Pixar.
Movies are created by a large group 
of people who work well together, 
said Catmull. While it is important to 
train newcomers well and to crosstrain the veterans, a third benefit is the 
social atmosphere created when all 
these people of diverse backgrounds 
and talents come together to learn and 
work. By way of example, Catmull 
described a sculpting class he had visit
ed in which programmers, animators, 
and sculptors, all of various skill levels, 
were chatting, learning, and making 
connections with one another.
Learning and working hard certain
ly help people improve and attain their 
very best work, but it is just as impor/
tant to be willing to show ones work 
without embarrassment every day, 
Catmull said. If you show your work to 
others every day, when youre done, 
youre done. Everyone has offered 
advice and criticism, and the finished 
product represents all of the best possi
ble suggestions. Saving up until the 
end will only bring a slew of correc
tions and suggestions that, once com
pleted, will probably engender more of 
the same.
There is a structure underlying 
books, plays, and even films, accord
ing to Catmull, and if the underlying 
structure of a film holds together well, 
then the animators, artists, and pro
grammers are simply adding another 
layer. Even within the film-making 
process, there are layers; Catmull 
played several different build reels 
from the recent Pixar film Monsters, 
Inc., which clearly illustrated the evo
lution of the film from the choppy 
hand-drawn scenes of the story reel 
to the seamless computer animation of 
the final simulation reel.
Citing recent concern among actors 
about being replaced by animated 
characters, Catmull spent some time 
allaying such worries. Though actors 
may be worried about an animated 
character taking over what they do, 
that simply will never be the case. Elvis 
impersonators cannot replace Elvis; 
they are just that  impersonators.
Do stunt doubles replace actors 
sometimes? he asked. Yes. There are 
some situations where its preferable to 
have a synthetic person blown up than

New type of string 
theory invented
A theoretical physicist from the 
National Institute for Nuclear Physics 
and High Energy Physics in the 
Netherlands has found a new way D 
describe the universe with string the
ory.
String theory tries to connect grav
ity with the interactions of matter as 
described by quantum mechanics. ]t 
helps to describe very dense objects, 
like the universe just after the Bij 
Bang. Besides the three dimensions 
of space and one of time to which w? 
are accustomed, string theory say? 
that there are six more dimensions 
too small to be observed directly.
Lennaert Huiszoon worked with 
open strings, which can be visualized 
as elastic bands which move through 
space and time. He calculated the 
spaces through which the endpoims 
of the string could move. These 
spaces are also known as D-brane;, 
after the mathematician Dirichle:. 
Huiszoon believes that our universe is 
a four-dimensional D-brane. To prove 
it, a D-brane would have to be found 
that describes all the elementary par
ticles charges, spins, and masses.
His structures were all simple sym
metric spaces or group spaces. An 
example of a two-dimehsional group 
space is a circle, while a three-dimen
sional group space is a Sphere. Strings 
in these sorts of spacefc only move in 
certain paths. Huiszoon hopes to find 
a D-brane that would vindicate his 
belief.

found in plants
Scientists have recovered DNA 
from plants 400,000 years old. This h 
the oldest DNA that has ever been 
found and authenticated. Though 
some claimed to have found older 
DNA, it was difficult to rule out cont
amination from dig sites. To prevent 
this, the scientists introduced a 
tagged bacteria around the drilling 
tools. This bacteria was not detectec 
on the samples, so they are assumed 
to be clean.
Eske Willerslev and colleagues 
from the University of Copenhagen 
were searching the Siberian tundra 
for bacterial DNA, and instead found 
DNA from 42 plants and mosses and 
eight mammals, including the wooly 
mammoth. Willerslevs group 
searched sediment samples rather 
than looking for hard or soft tissue 
remains, the more traditional 
sources.
His team also traveled to New 
Zealand, where they found DNA from 
two extinct species of moa (a large 
flightless bird) and 29 plants that 
existed in the region before man 
arrived.

Colborns manner smacks 
of grandmotherhood. She likes 
to watch birds out of her win

served on EPA advisory boards,
 done seminal research on endocrine

prominent book Our Stolen Future, 
among other achievements. There 
will be a book signing and reception 
after the lecture.
She is among the worlds most

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals, 
like dioxin (released when plastic is 
burned) and bisphenol-A (the build

used in everything from CDs to 
TVs), can affect the bodys hormonsystem in several ways. They 
imitate estrogen, causing the 
body to think there is more 
estrogen than there really is 
and mixing up chemical sig

people have been born with 
deformed sexual organs 
and abnormal behavior 
because of exposure to 
endocrine disruptors. 
This exposure takes 
place in the womb and

THE TARTAN  APRIL 20, 2003
Gulf War II highlights new developments in bleeding-edge military tech
MILITARY, from page A6
By relying more and more on satellite 
systems to illuminate the battlefield, the 
military is reducing the need for sus
tained bombing campaigns and lowaltitude missions.
The Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)  or 
so-called bunker buster  was as 
much a product of necessity as were the 
GPS-guided JDAMs. During Operation 
Desert Storm, many Iraqi soldiers had 
burrowed deep into underground tun
nels and shelters, eliminating the possi
bility of hitting them with extant muni
tions. The U.S. Air Force, recognizing 
the need for weapons capable of reach
ing targets several hundred feet into the 
earth, developed the current line of 
GBU 28/37 Penetrators.
Approximately 19 feet long, the 
bunker busters, named for their ability 
to virtually dig a trench into the targets 
surface and detonate, are a combina
tion of simple design and high-tech 
delivery. Bunker busters are both 
extremely narrow and incredibly heavy, 
and when dropped at high altitudes 
from aircraft like the Stealth bomber, 
the bombs are lethally effective. Their 
laser-guided tips locate the target as
nates, and monitor fire distribution bet
ter than before.
Imagine 500 vehicles moving across 
the ground, all transmitting in real-time 
formations. Youre talking about mov
ing the equivalent of a city  wires, 
buildings, everything  across a coun
trys landscape, says Sgt. Major Lewis 
Matson, public relations representative 
to Operations for CENTCOM, or Central 
Command, currently based in Doha, 
Qatar. Using digitized imaging and 
computer mapping, tanks and armor in 
the 4th Division were able to wend their 
way through northern Iraq, securing 
the area and beating back the resistance 
that Special Operations-led Kurdish 
freedom fighters had not already sub
dued.
Iraqi Scud missiles did a great deal of 
damage during the first Gulf War, fre
quently battering Kuwait City in night
time raids. Twelve years later, however, 
virtually no Scuds were able to hit the 
Iraqi neighbor, thanks in part to updat
ed versions of the popular Patriot air 
defense system. The PAC3 Patriot mis
sile system is deployed in a battery of 
eight to ten launchers and is intended to 
hit incoming Scuds and other ballistics, 
detonating on or near the target. The

they fall, and, in the case of the GBU-28, 
are fitted with a delay fuse, resulting in 
detonation after penetration rather 
than following impact. The GBU-37, 
meanwhile, is satellite-guided, more 
expensive, and commonly dropped 
from altitudes approaching 40,000 feet. 
The two decapitation strikes carried 
out against the suspected locations of 
Iraqi officials, including Saddam 
Hussein, were made with GBU bunker 
busters.
The 4th Infantry Division was the 
first of the so-called digitized divisions 
in Operation: Iraqi Freedom because it 
showcased new vehicles and tanks 
capable of advanced networking. In the 
past, armored personnel had to rely on 
radio communication to relay coordi
nates and lock onto targets. Now, 
actions which would have eaten up 
valuable target acquisition time have 
been eliminated or minimized, thanks 
to GPS/aerial imaging that can create 
virtual maps of the battle theater. M1A1 
Abrams battle tanks and M2A3 Bradley 
fighting vehicles can now see the com
puter-mapped terrain, tighten coordi
version utilized in Iraq was a singlestage, short-range, low-to-high-altitude 
missile powered by a solid propellant 
rocket motor.
According to the Army Fact Sheet, 
the PAC3 can travel up to speeds reach
ing Mach 5 and altitudes of 15 kilome
ters while homing in on targets with 
millimeter-wave radar and hitting with 
an archers accuracy. Despite its impres
sive credentials, the Patriot system has 
run into problems, even up until recent
ly-Coalition forces suffered the first 
friendly fire incident of the war when 
a Patriot missile mistakenly shot down a 
British Royal Air Force fighter jet near 
the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border on March 23. 
The two pilots on board were killed 
when a technological glitch failed to 
alert the missiles radar system to the 
approaching warplane, which had been 
outfitted with a transponder designat
ing it a coalition aircraft, the Royal Air 
Force confirmed.
Technological updates to aircraft in 
the post-Gulf War period have ranged 
from increased payload capacity to
pilotless planes, conjuring images of 
video game scenarios where flyboys can 
target and attack positions from com
mand posts hundreds, even thousands 
of miles away.
While were not quite at the level of 
armchair firefights from across an 
ocean, the breakthroughs in aircraft 
technology in the past twelve years have 
been mind-blowing. Information net
working, radar imaging, weapons-carrying drones, and hyper-altitude flight 
have all made the Air Force, arguably, 
the most tech-sawy service branch of 
them all. During Operation: Iraqi 
Freedom, an interlocking landscape of 
reconnaissance planes, drones, command-and-control aircraft, and 
advanced fighters made U.S. airpower 
virtually impenetrable to the Soviet-era 
anti-aircraft and armored divisions of 
the Iraqi regular army. Said Matson of 
the advantage American airpower 
enjoyed: [Its akin] to one boxer wear
ing cement boots with one eye trying to 
fight another boxer who can run around 
the ring as well. Much of this versatili
ty advantage grew out of advanced 
radar and cameras capturing enemy 
ground movements on high-resolution 
displays and then transmitting them in 
real-time to loitering aircraft which 
could engage these targets of opportu
nity in strikes made by fighter jets or 
bombers, depending on size and troop 
concentration.
Among new aircraft, the drones seem 
to garner the most interest, both for 
their ability to fly unmanned missions 
at long clips as well as the potential they 
represent for a pilotless air force, there
by significantly limiting casualties and 
flying missions from command posts far 
from the theater of war. The Global 
Hawk, this years high-profile aircraft, 
made its debut last year in Afghanistan, 
where the 44-foot-long plane per
formed reconnaissance missions similar 
to the U-2 spy plane, albeit without a 
pilot in the cockpit. In terms of hard
ware, the RQ-4A Global Hawk, an 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, or UAV, is 
constructed of lightweight, composite 
material. Indeed, over half its body, 
from engine cover to wing fairings, are 
composed of the same material, allow
ing for high-altitude, high-endurance 
missions. The Global Hawk can fly as 
high as 60,000 feet, out of the range of 
most radar, and monitor entire land
scapes with dizzying accuracy, trans
mitting images back to ground opera
tors who can then pass on the data to a 
command center for targeting purpos
es.
The RQ-1 Predator differs from its 
cousin both in size (27 feet) and flight 
capability (it operates up to 26,000 
feet). According to a spokesman for Air

Force Secretary James G. Roche, as 
reported by The New York Times, the 
Predators function in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom was to search for Scud launch
ers, mobile targets such as ground divi
sions, and Baathist officials. The 
Predator can stay aloft for up to 24 
hours without having to refuel and is 
equipped with Hellfire missiles, making 
it target-capable if necessary. The drone 
was used to destroy a transport carrying 
a suspected al Qaida operative traveling 
through Yemen on November 3, 2002. 
Unfortunately, mistakes can still occur, 
as was the case on April 6, when a 
Predator-targeted group of 18 Kurds 
were bombed by allied forces. The 
drone, it seems, was unable to distin
guish between the small group of coalition-backed soldiers and an Iraqi force, 
and instructed a fighter loitering nearby 
to bomb the target. However, the live 
video which the UAVs send to group 
troops, command centers, and even off
shore gunships is an invaluable tool in
shortening the so-called kill chain, i.e. 
the time from when a potential target is 
identified to when it is attacked. Thanks 
to developments in unmanned aircraft, 
eyes on the battlefield are less limited by 
their earthly positions than ever before.
What can Americans expect from 
their military in the future? According 
to most indicators, the next weapon to 
be tweaked is the soldier himself. The 
Armys Land Warrior program is being 
developed by military researchers as a 
way to enhance soldiers situational 
awareness, mobility, and training. The 
system will also feature thermo-imaging and video sights integrated into a 
self-contained unit somewhere on the 
soldiers body.
The standard Battle Dress Uniform is 
being updated to protect a soldier from 
bullets, directed energy, and chemical 
weapons. Smart weapons, able to see 
around buildings in close-quarter com
bat, will soon be able to target enemies 
and close in on them after firing. The
soldier will be a moving virtual com
mand center running on a 12-hour bat
tery. As new developments in battery 
life are introduced, the Army says it will 
be made available to all tactical teams 
and eventually produced on a mass 
scale.
War is not what it was five, ten, or fif
teen years ago. New technological 
breakthroughs have ushered in battle 
scenarios to which we can respond in a 
manner that is faster, deadlier, and 
more efficient. But do not break out that 
joystick just yet; there is still a long way 
to go before wars are fought with the 
sterility and safety of a video game. War 
remains a hellish thing, and despite our 
most detergent innovations, we cannot 
do away with its stark realities. For the 
time being, at least, the onus is on 
humans to make war and to avoid it. 
Says Matson, There is still no substitute 
for the human computer. Our most 
important piece of technology is the 
American citizen.

Education City no Qatar ball 
in academic bowl for new digs
positive trickle-down effect in both popu
lations. Education City represents a 
unique opportunity. The Universitys role 
could help burnish Americas name in the 
Middle East. To many of the regions citi
zens, the Western worlds legacy is one of 
political pressure, imperialistic intentions, 
and outright bullying.
It is easy for Carnegie Mellon to get 
caught up in the idealistic possibilities of 
the Qatar project and forget its domestic 
obligations. The University must ensure 
that it does not commit so many resources, 
personnel-wise, that its operations in 
Pittsburgh are adversely affected. In 
recent years, the University has taken a 
vested interest in revitalizing Pittsburgh 
and making it a more desirable destination 
for young professionals. Let the University 
not lose sight of the problems in its own 
backyard as it embarks on a project to rev
olutionize education in Qatar.
Another concern that has been raised 
pertains to the safety and security of the 
Carnegie Mellon personnel that will be 
working in Qatar. Although Qatar is not 
caught up in the chaos surrounding Iraq or 
Israel, the region's overall instability can
not be ignored. And certainly the 
University and the Qatar Foundation must 
investigate the merits of a recent news 
story reporting that the Qatari govern
ment aided a senior operative of al Qaeda.
Ultimately, the Qatar Foundation's 
proposition is an honor and speaks to the 
respect Carnegie Mellon holds within the 
international academic community. If the 
University has the resources and know
how to help spread its educational model, 
it ought to proceed, albeit cautiously.
Carnegie Mellon and the Qatar 
Foundation continue to discuss the devel
opment of computer science and business 
programs for a new Alexandria. Education 
City, located on the outskirts of Doha, 
Qatar's capital, is an audacious project, 
according to Provost Mark Kamlet, which 
would reestablish the region as an acade
mic center. The University's endeavor into 
the Middle East is in its preliminary stages, 
and administrators should continue to 
deliberately pursue an agreement. In addi
tion to the probable financial windfall, 
Carnegie Mellon has a vested interest in 
broadening its reach as an institution of 
higher learning and increasing the scope 
of the education it offers to its students.
Expanding to Qatar could bring a num
ber of benefits to the University. 
Academically, the overseas effort could 
lead to greater international collabora
tions and make Carnegie Mellon more 
attractive for world-class faculty and 
researchers. For students, Qatar could 
become a unique study abroad destina
tion, and Qatari students could also come 
to Pittsburgh to learn. There is no doubt 
that this University would appreciate such 
an exchange, given its principle of diversi
ty-n the bigger picture, Carnegie Mellon 
and the Qatar Foundation could help 
bridge the gap that separates these very 
different regions. If Qatar establishes good 
relations with prominent American insti
tutions, its neighbors in the Middle East 
may be encouraged to do the same. With 
American and Qatari students and profes
sors forging strong relationships and shar
ing educational resources, there could be a

CAKE coverage a slice

had none. She clearly got there early and 
didnt stay long, as mid-way through the 
event, people were crowding to write 
responses. I had to wait until nearly every
one was gone before I could add mine). This 
thematic aspect was draped over a com
memoration of the design seniors time 
together at CMU. If Ms. Schaefer had taken 
the time to read the posters (there were a 
few), as well as to mingle and interview Ms. 
Chassot, then she might not have been so 
confused. My own confusion about the 
nature of the event (I am neither a design 
student nor a member of the CMU commu
nity) lasted right up until I climbed to the 
balcony to watch the crowd below. People 
were talking, tables were occupied by stable 
groups for hours, and Ms. Chassot buzzed 
around, playing host and second-fiddle to
the community of design seniors that Ms. 
Schaefer has ironically credited for the 
event. Unlike the CAKE, the Community 
was not shoved down anyones throat, but it 
was in ample evidence. Ms. Schaefers 
unflattering opinion of the event is not a 
problem. Mediocre coverage, betrayed by a 
lack of effort and interest, is. Her opinion 
may or may not have been changed if she 
had been more thorough; that she dared to 
critique the event, offering such a bland

. Dear Editor,
Ms. Schaefers summary and critique of 
the CAKE/Community event was rash and 
superficial, making the event and the per
son behind it look undeservedly shallow. 
Among other problems with the coverage, 
there was no interview with the person 
responsible for all phases of the project, 
Nanda Chassot. The event that Ms. Schaefer 
attended was the culmination of a series of 
smaller, private events, each a meditation 
on a different, traditionally cake-laden occa
sion. In turn, these occasions were reflected 
in the question-and-answer displays (of 
these displays, Ms. Schaefer reports that,

Editors note: The CAKE/Community arti
cle was mistakenly labeled as a project by the 
entire senior design class in Issue 22.Affairs Michael Murphy has promoted stu
dent choice by applying economic theory 
to CMU dining, Devine is doing just the 
opposite. Students can no longer shop for 
courses, limiting their ability to find cours
es that suit them. The capability of profes
sors to develop strong courses and receive 
feedback is severely limited by the new 
program, as it forces students to abide by 
course choices made frantically during 
registration week. Courses lack concise 
descriptions, forcing students to attend 
the class and receive a syllabus before 
determining its value. With the ability now 
removed for many students, overall class 
satisfaction is likely to drop. Blackboard 
prevents students from accessing syllabi 
and gauging a courses workload. H&SS 
should at the least force the information to 
be placed online so students can make an 
informed choice.
Although the number of students drop
ping a class can be problematic for a pro
fessor, students should not bear the reper
cussions. A high drop rate is usually due to 
poor teaching, which, under the new poli
cy, students will be forced to tolerate. If it 
is accountability the policy is after, then 
overly-considerate drop deadlines should 
be the target, not the ability to overload. 
The policys expressed goal of increasing 
in-class participation is unfounded  stu
dents are more likely to miserable than 
contemplative about courses.
Devine is approving applications for 
overloading on an individual basis, but has 
yet to create a uniform policy. Such a 
biased system is not beneficial to students, 
especially when Devine is an authority too 
reckless to make academic decisions for 
students he has little contact with and who 
can better judge their own needs.
H&SS has not sufficiently inspected its 
program from all perspectives, and admits 
that it may need modifications. They hope 
this ill-designed program will be modeled 
by other colleges, but seem to be woefully 
confused about their own version.
H&SS announced a new overload policy 
last week, restricting the freedom of its 
own students while benefiting students 
outside the college. The policy, emailed to 
students just over a week before registra
tion, raises the requirements for overload
ing. Only an elite 20 percent of the college 
 those with QPAs of 3.5 or better  can 
take 50 units or more when given explicit 
consent. H&SS students who want to over
load must now receive approval from their 
academic advisor and H&SS Associate 
Dean Joseph Devine. It is a time consum
ing chore for students. The policy was sup
posedly designed to create more time for 
students, but ironically requires the 
tedious process of obtaining multi-layered 
approval.
Admitting nearly half of all its appli
cants, three times the rate of the School of 
Computer Science, H&SS developed the 
policy to reduce student stress and pro
mote self-reflection. The new policy 
strengthens the meager-intelligence image 
of its students, believing that students are 
incapable of handling an above- average 
course load. According to the schools sta
tistics, more than half of students taking 
one or two extra classes maintain the same 
QPA or better. Even though grades of some 
students suffer, the school does not 
attempt to research the issues. QPA can 
decrease for a variety of reasons some 
students overload to compensate for a 
required class that they suspect will 
decrease their QPA.
The policy benefits students in other col
leges, who do not have the same harsh 
overload policy. Last year, over 300 stu
dents were double-majoring in an H&SS 
offering, forcing many students with 
H&SS as their home college onto wait
lists. Many of the colleges best classes 
have massive waiting lists, which the new 
policy does not properly address.
Student choice is severely limited by this 
policy, even as it degrades the breadth of 
education. Whereas Dean of Student

Theres a story about the University 
Center that goes as follows: 1,000,000 
bricks were allocated for the buildings con
struction, but after construction was com
pleted, the count ended up at 999,997. 
When the planned brick count was found to 
be short a few bricks, someone got together 
some mortar and slapped a few more bricks 
any old place in the basement, to reach the 
magic million. Inside the UC, there has been 
another building project underway.
Student activities are a big pile of bricks 
that a committee gets to play with. Each 
year, more organizations join the mix, 
straining an already fragile budget and bud
getary system. Unlike Carnegie Mellons 
University Center, the JFC has no mortar to 
hold together its creation. The sad truth is 
zero theres documentation.
Its a shame that the pile is getting so 
large, and one group passes to the next 
exactly the following: previous student 
organization budgets, a budget form, and a 
few dozen lines in the student body consti
tution to regulate the whole thing; the 
inheritance items are according to JFC chair 
Alison McKenna, who is compiling some 
documentation of her own to pass on to the 
next chairperson.
The constitution of the student body is a 
more elegant document than probably most 
of our other legal documents. Constitutions 
in general tend to stick to the necessary, 
while legislation is supposed to expand and 
patch it.
There are about 30 senators right now on 
campus, who control roughly 30 of 5,000 
parts of students total manpower. But they 
do, in fact, represent us all. Senate has a 
chance to break free from the perpetuity 
because Senate now has the opportunity to 
walk softly and carry a big stick.
Consider the task of the JFC.

that, in regards to the direction the Iraqi 
conflict is headed, WAR is RAW.
Operation Iraqi Freedom has become an 
evening of professional wrestling. Just like 
Monday Night RAW, the war is getting 
absurd. I can picture the production now. In 
a jam-packed auditorium, the crowd gath
ers, some carrying signs saying Bush 3:16 
or Saddam Sucks, others wearing shirts 
with similar slogans. Everyone sports a mul
let, no one bothers with sleeves, and the 
beer flows like water. Theyre ready for the 
show. The lights dim, a hard rock version of 
the National Anthem comes on, smoke and 
lighting effects shoot out across the stadi
um.
As the cheers drift down from the upper 
levels, America and the Coalition Forces 
storm down the ramp towards the ring. The 
cheering is deafening now, and for those of 
us enjoying the entertainment from our 
couch at home, a scratchy-voiced announcer 
and a goof of an ex-wrestler are providing 
the necessary commentary. As the
Coalition Force stalks around the ring like a 
caged animal, Saddam and his Republican 
Guard play their music and enter the stadi
um. They wade their way through boos and 
insults and jump into the ring.
After more parading and flaunting, the 
match begins. It isnt really a contest, 
America and the Coalition dispatch the Iraqi 
force quickly, but just when it looks like the 
match is over, Syria comes dashing down 
the ramp with a chair! Quickly hustling 
Iraqs managers back up the ramp, the little 
Syrians stand in bold defiance of the 
American beast. All those tuned in are going 
crazy, the show is really going great now. 
Everyone is entertained.
And, as Monday Night RAW usually tends 
to be, the whole thing is ridiculous. Done 
with Iraq, America has turned its vigilant 
eye towards the Syrians. Let me begin by 
saying I supported the war; Saddam needed 
to be dealt with, and he has been. Now Colin

The Burgh brand is \ 
not capturing spirit 
of Pitts people, city |
yi,unluoe Fb hwnludm
Take a moment to think about the following: World Class 
Urban Setting ... Small Town Feel; A Genuine Opportunity 
to Make an Impact; Heritage and Current Home of j 
Innovation and Transformation; Pride in Working, 
Making, and Creating; Rivers, Mountains, and Outdoor 
Adventure Surrounding Unique Urban Beauty.
According to the Image Gap Committee, these five things 
make up the brand for the Pittsburgh area. Created to 
align peoples perceptions with the realities of life in our j 
area, the Image Gap Committee is composed of dozens of 
local leaders and group representatives. Its purpose is to 
develop a brand or scheme to solve the areas image problem 
and help organizations market the city in a consistent man
ner to tourists, professionals, and companies. After spending 
months working on the issue and releasing a couple of cryp- j 
tic statements, the committee came up with these five parts 
that make up Pittsburghs image.
Sounds rather vague, doesnt it? You could apply any of 
these phrases to just about any city of your choice. Want to j 
make an impact while living in an area both urban and 
rural? Move to Harrisburg. Care about pride in working and 
making? No city is going to claim that doesnt apply. 
Heritage and current innovation? Philadelphia, Detroit, and 
Seattle can all point to their own examples.
Therein lies the problem with the work of the Image Gap 
Committee. Instead of concentrating on what truly sepa
rates the Pittsburgh region from other cities of similar size, 
theyve developed a bland cake mix for a marketing plan. 
Just add water, bake 20 minutes, and youve got yourself an I 
all-American city. As a result, theyve wasted a prime oppor
tunity not only to showcase Pittsburghs strengths, but also ; 
to address serious problems that no marketing or branding 
scheme can gloss over.
Pittsburgh is too complex to be boiled down to five vague 
bullet points that also cover almost any similarly-sized city. 
The committee should have started with the question of 
what people want in a city. The answer is simple: everything. 
They want good schools, easy access to fun things, educa
tional opportunities, low crime, inexpensive housing, and so 
on. Ironically, this could have led the committee to develop 
a one-bullet-point brand that is specific to the area. In 
essence, Pittsburgh can be all things to all people (okay, I'm 
not a marketing guru; undoubtedly, someone could do much 
better).
Think about it. If you want to live in a city, live downtown 
or in one of the nearby suburbs. Prefer rural settings like 
myself? OHara and Indiana provide decently-priced homes. 
Weve got the highest per capita concentration of golf cours
es and the only national aviary. Weve got numerous colleges 
and more parks than you can shake a stick at. Kennywood is 
on every rollercoaster fans top-10 list. Dont know where to 
start? You could use a few Rick Sebak PBS specials to plan 
out an entire year of weekend activities. Start with 
Pittsburgh: A to Z.
I could fill pages of The Tartan with this stuff, and thats 
what makes the area unique. Given its size and geography, 
you simply cannot find a similar city by any stretch of the 
imagination. As the saying goes, the devil is in the details, 
and thats what should guide the committee.
The Image Gap Committee could have also helped tackle 
serious issues that detract from living in the area. True, they 
cant solve them, but the committee could have used its 
members networks and positions to champion much-need- j 
ed changes.
For example, Allegheny County needs billions of dollars in 
upgrades and repairs to its sewer and water systems, sys
tems whose states of disrepair have already caused compa
nies not to relocate here. Pennsylvanias liquor laws make it 
a laughingstock. We can renew licenses online but cant buy 
beer in a grocery store. Pittsburgh is considering a 10 per
cent drink tax, creating yet another reason to partake of 
recreation outside the city.
Perhaps most importantly, companies in the area refuse to 
pay competitive wages for skilled professionals. Pittsburghs 
only saving grace in this area is its low cost of living. 
However, that doesnt justify below-market wages. Every j 
year, lots of talented students from GSIA and CMU leave for 
greener pastures and bigger paychecks.
Some of these issues obviously extend to the county and j 
state level, but they seriously impact the areas brand. No 
amount of brand management will eliminate the fact that | 
such conditions seriously hamper efforts to attract and 
retain companies and professionals.
Despite these drawbacks, this is still the best area to live in 
if you want it all or at least want it all available to you. Ive 
traveled through just about every state in the country. Ive 
lived in the Detroit area, Orlando, San Diego, upstate New 
York, south central Indiana, and Ohio. The Pittsburgh area 
truly provides something for everybody. Thats Pittsburghs j 
strength, and that should be its brand.
Christian M. Restifo (cr2r@) is a third year Flex-Time MBA 
student. He thinks the best thing about Pittsburgh is that its 
not Cleveland.

Maybe I cant persuade everyone that 
human life has value. Civilian casualties 
and chaotic looting have disrupted the the 
lives of Iraqs people. Taking a step back 
from humans, lets honor this weeks Earth 
Day by examining wars impact on the 
environment and its animals.
The war in Iraq is now winding down; 
the environmental harm resulting from 
the war, though, is not confined to the 
immediate conflict. With possible military 
action against Syria and other nations 
looming ahead, wars environmental dev
astation cannot be ignored as we forget
about Iraq.
There is one point on which everyone 
agrees: War is bad for the environment, 
said a recent San Francisco Chronicle arti
cle recapping the effects of the 1991 war in 
Iraq. That war left the country in a state of 
havoc, with waterborne diseases, endan
gered plant and animal species, polluted 
ecosystems, and eroded soil. Iraqi civilians 
and American soldiers alike were presum
ably exposed to nerve gas, causing Gulf 
War Syndrome. Despite the toxic clouds, 
oil-soaked birds, and fires above oil wells 
visible to all, Iraqs environment did noth
ing to deserve becoming the enemy. 
Environmental rehabilitation in the 
Persian Gulf was all but ignored within 
Iraqs borders, prompting great concern 
about neglect in that wars sequel as well.
While the desert is practically ubiqui
tous in Iraq, it has been virtually absent in
media coverage. The desert is quite misun
derstood and overlooked by the general 
public; it is a living ecosystem, rich in flora 
and fauna and with a fragile surface. 
Driving heavy military vehicles and equip
ment across the desert causes damage for 
which recovery can take decades.
More obvious environmental conse
quences of war directly affect humans and 
wildlife, especially in the long term, which 
we cant explicitly foresee. War destroys 
habitats and settlements for both humans 
and animals and causes pollution to the 
land, air, and water.
Bombs meant to inflict harm dont help 
anybody. Various bombs and explosives in 
the U.S. arsenal, such as bullets made with 
depleted uranium which were used in the 
1991 Iraq war, are weapons of mass

American feminism today faces a Catch22 similar to the G.I.s return home follow
ing the Second World War. For the homebound soldier, his options dealt him a dis
quieting future. For one thing, he could 
comport himself to the slow, steady life of 
a family man, get a job, and reduce his ves
tigial wanderlust to Levittown, Long 
Island, or he could go back to the fighting 
and killing that roughly one year ago had 
competed for his time, thoughts, and 
adventuresome spirit.
Stability and certain spiritual rot on the 
one hand, the power and romance that 
came with a short, brutal life on the other. 
Some men chose the former, sowing their 
seeds in suburbia and taking up with a 
family. Not all of them were happy; still, 
some longed for a wife and a neatlytrimmed square of Bermuda grass. The 
deracination was too much for others, 
however, and this group was the sort who 
picked the latter course.
They ended up on skiff barges, oil 
refineries, in the employ of Canadian log
ging companies, or rolling drunk on some 
nameless Mexican street, their hoots regis
tering like incantations for a life never fully 
realized. But certainly it must have been 
fun while it lasted. Similarly, American 
feminists  not to speak of their European 
and Asian counterparts, but the example is 
better applied locally  face a crossroad of 
cultural choice.
Have a look at television today, most any 
channel but especially cable, and it is com
monplace that men are hopeless pigs. 
More specifically, we are self-indulgent, 
ironical, and completely dead-set in our 
pig-ness, if such members of the academic 
community as Dr. Phil are to be believed. It 
is almost as if there was a mass retreat of 
logic from several centuries of enlighten
ment for the male species, who have decid
ed theyd much rather act in accordance 
with Lord of the Flies principles than sit 
through another Martha Stewart segment. 
And thus it has fallen on feminists to deal 
with.
Faced with the beer commercial phe
nomenon, feminists can do one of the fol
lowing: turn up their noses at this new, 
keenly conscious objective society and risk 
sounding priggish and reactionary; or give 
in to female objectivity, spin it on their 
own terms, and acquiesce to that part of 
the American landscape which cant tell 
the difference. It appears, at this stage in 
its development at least, that feminism has 
chosen the latter evil.
For all its haunting language and 
shrewd sense of history, feminism in 2003 
acts as if its charter were written by a Wet 
Seal employee rather than a disciple of 
Mary Wollstonecraft. To believe that sexu
al equity is brought about by low-rise jeans
and birdbath-sized martini glasses is to 
take everything played out on programs 
like Sex and the City as fact, not the ficti
tious romp it is supposed to be.
In short, the current line of thinking 
regarding male chauvinism is a If you 
cant beat em, join em attitude that con
currently gives us comedic gestures like 
The Sweetest Thing along with the slatterns 
of the voyeuristic Girls Gone Wild series of 
videos.
The problem with this land of imitation 
may not ultimately be what it has pro
duced (the female as predator, sexual 
openness), but rather where feminism is 
drawing its inspiration from, as well as the 
attendant consequences that have since 
begun to surface.
There is a good argument to be made 
that the recent descent into male chauvinSee CHAUVINISM, page A12

ism is nothing more than deliberate 
self-parody.
* Television programs like The Man 
i:Show and so-called lad magazines
I like Maxim are engaging in a kind of 
! clever self-reflection of maleness, 
^winking at us with one eye as they 
"ogle cleavage with the other.
 This is the take on it, and indeed, 
given the kind of gratuitous stupidity 
found between its pages and comI rnercial breaks, it is hard to believe 
anyone takes Maxim or The Man 
Show very seriously. David Brooks 
noted this when, writing in last 
months Atlantic Monthly, he 
described the retro-sexism thusly: 
The men are making fun of them
selves as much as they are degrading 
women.
Besides, its not reality. Its just a 
normal urge to flout convention, to 
have some bawdy fun. It doesnt 
mean anything.
As a heterosexual male, Im quite 
capable of enjoying the momentary 
escape that comes with a locker room 
joke or a night out to a strip bar. 
There are certainly many like myself,
imperfect like myself, who see the 
enjoyment in The Man Show's humor 
and Maxims iconoclasm.
The point is, though, that we get 
it. More importantly (and more 
troubling), there are those among us 
who do not get it. For these men, 
the joke never gets old and the night 
out cant go on long enough. By emu
lating the kind of retro-sexism Brooks 
talks about, modern-day feminists 
imitate boorish (male) behavior 
under the guise of empowerment, 
but instead risk fulfilling the very 
roles lusted after by the less selfreflective among us.
The eventual danger is that the 
flabby thinking that has given us the 
super bar-heroine story Coyote Ugly 
and similar others may one day soon 
reap its unintended consequences. 
On this day, male chauvinists might 
finally look across the gender gap and 
become disgusted to see their own 
crude image staring them back in the 
face.

SYRIA, from page A10
Powell claims he is headed to Syria to 
have very straightforward and can
did discussions with the Syrian offi
cials about harboring Iraqi military 
leaders. While Bush pursues officials 
from the toppled Iraqi regime across 
the desert, he is costing himself sup
port both at home and abroad. 
Americans dont need to see their 
country flex muscle in Syria.
We arent watching our favorite 
wrestler become King of the Ring; we 
are watching our sons and daughters 
risk their lives. As much as the situa
tion necessitated conflict when it 
i began, it has ceased to be important 
I enough to risk American lives. Bush 
I claims that Syria just needs to coop1 erate with our demands to avoid con
flict, putting the burden of peace on 
them. Yet it lies on us now. We do not 
need to fight Syria over some 
deposed officials, or anything for that 
matter. It isnt worth it; it isnt worth 
our time or our soldiers.

same. Both are insignificant in the 
grand scheme of things; these coun
tries pose little or no threat to our 
nations security. Iraq had a leader 
hostile to the United States; he har
bored and supported terrorism, and 
the threat of chemical weapons from 
his country required that he be dealt 
with. A situation like that does not 
exist in Syria. The only threat from 
countries like Syria are the repercus
sions of an attack on them. The war 
in Iraq is coming to a close. The job is 
done. Saddam is gone. Well have a 
puppet government feeding us cheap
oil in no time. We are on top right

destruction with radiological consequences such 
as widespread cancer and leukemia. Toxic chemi
cals and unexploded ammunition poison the land. 
Bombs cant discover suspected chemical and bio
logical weapons, but they do contribute to the 
spread of lethal chemical and biological agents. 
Especially pertinent to future military engage
ments, the Bush administration has not ruled out 
employing nuclear weapons.
While there are other reasons behind war in the 
Middle East, oil seems to be more of a motivating 
factor than the Bush Administration is willing to 
admit. Its futile to fight wars for oil when only the 
development new technologies can solve our 
energy needs. Waging wars to control an energy 
source that is finite will never achieve long-term 
national security, points out the activist group 
Environmentalists Against War.
An assessment of environmental problems 
caused by war would not be complete without dis
cussing animals. When we hear figures about all 
the civilians and soldiers wounded and killed, 
nobody even considers all the animals affected. 
Then again, some animals can no longer claim 
civilian status.
The U.S. military has recruited various types of 
animals for its service in this war, creating a media 
show starring dolphins, sea lions, and birds totally 
removed from their natural habitat. Historically, 
animals have been vital in warfare, but in an age 
of superior technology, they should be retired.
Dolphins, prized for their echo-location, have 
been working for the Navy in the Iraqi port of
Umm Qasr detecting mines. While technically the 
first mine-detecting dolphins ever used by the U.S. 
in combat, dolphins planted mines in Vietnam and 
have an extensive history of military service. All 
the dolphins currently working in Iraq were taken 
from the wild, and one was forced out of retire
ment despite being liberated four years ago. The 
Navy is currently pressuring Congress to exempt 
the military dolphins from the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act, abandoning any sense of responsi
bility.
The dolphins are supposedly well-treated and in 
minimal danger, according to handlers and other 
Navy officials. However, their job could be better 
performed by robot subs called Autonomous 
Underwater Vehicles. A Navy spokesperson 
recently said watching the dolphins detect mines 
is the best show in town, but creating a media 
spectacle is not justification for the dolphins 
deployment in Iraq.
In the Cold War, the Soviet Union had dolphins 
trained , to attack American dolphins. Why does 
one dolphin have a duty to fight for the U.S. and 
another for any other nation? Dolphins and many 
other animals serving in the military, even if 
entertaining and treated humanely, are not being 
used in their best interests. In a war without U.S. 
conscription, serving the military is not their deci
sion. Indeed, they shouldnt be fighting in wars at 
all.
Chickens were also employed in Iraq, to detect a 
possible chemical attack. If they dropped dead off 
their perches, Marines hypothetically would know 
to don protective gas masks. However, many of the 
chickens died for unrelated reasons, including
neglect, stress, and disease. Nobody in the 7th 
Regiment which they accompanied knew any
thing about chickens, so all the Marines panicked.
After this debacle, the chickens were replaced 
by pigeons in a purposeless change of species. We 
have the technology available so that we dont 
have to rely on chickens or pigeons dropping dead 
from above, and we should implement advanced 
chemical detection systems. Using animals in this 
manner serves as a media game and Sea World
like entertainment. Relying on animal fun and 
shying away from superior technology is a betray
al of our troops, who literally have their lives at 
stake.
Some might say the environment and animals 
are less important than the human tolls of war. If 
this is true, though, the environment and animals 
still have their own rights to exist, both indepen
dent of and interdependent with humans. Tlfe 
immorality of war is furthered by its inherent sus
pension of other moral and ethical judgments. 
Anyone with a basic respect for nature would 
probably agree that the role of dolphins and birds 
in the war in Iraq isnt quite natural.
When assessing the decisions to wage future 
wars and reporting on past and current wars, we 
must consider the subsequent environmental dev
astation. That would be a better task for news 
agencies than the current spectacles of amuse
ment which superficially neglect the horrors of 
war.W

Save JFC, end docu-drama and open books
JFC, from page A10
that they must figure out from a few spreadsheets 
and a paragraph in the constitution. No training, 
either. The first meeting is called, and delegates 
each get their organization assignments, eleven 
each this year. And as the job gets progressively 
more thankless, interest in Senate continues to 
flag.
Legislation to fix the JFC would have all the 
impact of Senates fist because it leverages the full 
financial strength of the student body. In the past 
week, Senate has had some part in rallying an out
cry from its constituents. Sixteen hundred stu
dents, judging from election turnouts, lent their 
collective voice to halt the ablation of minors from 
diplomas because of Senates influence.
But only the weight of the student activities fee 
will bring significant improvement to student life 
from Senate.
Like the federal government did by withholding 
highway funds in order to impose alcohol restric
tions, Senate can require organizations to give 
equal and detailed accounts of their budgets by 
withholding subsidies from those that do not 
suppy such budgets. Combined with a project to 
formalize the JFC process, we would not face
ridiculous budget cuts that force some organiza
tions into retirement, others to exit the JFC stage 
left (The Tartans case), and sizable budgetary 
reductions for yet others, such as baseball and the 
Activities Board.
While making all of that information public 
would also benefit the mechanism, it should at 
least all come in a similar and fully-compiled form 
to the JFC and Student Activities. Senate has the 
responsibility to do the legwork and create a good 
informational packet, and to standardize the bud
get information requirements from each organiza
tion.
A perusal of the student activity budgets will 
provide excellent insight for creating an elegant 
and informative budget form, as a few organiza
tions do the job well, although input from a few 
business professors and administrators should be 
sought as well.
The informational packet is difficult to do well, 
but the potential of such a tool justifies the use of 
Senates time far more than an Iraqi peace resolu
tion, which couldnt be sorted out before the last 
bomb was dropped.
As for freedom of information, its silly not to 
have but shouldnt impede Senate from taking the 
above actions. Hopefully, a more streamlined
process will also make the job less daunting for 
prospective JFC delegates.
People can come to the realization that shared 
buggy information would only lead to more excit
ing buggies (the result of collaborative innova
tion) later. And the JFC can acquire prices from AB 
Tech prior to budgeting, but common sense does
nt even need toprevail in this case to help the JFC 
process. Senate has the opportunity to pass a bill 
to fix the JFC. Many student leaders agree, includ
ing your soon-to-be-ex-president Brian Namey, Afe 
chair Fred Merkle, and notably the current JFC 
chair, that the activities fee should be raised, I 
argue that by doubling the fee to 72 bucks a head, 
students would get a lot of utility out of the 
money; we must suffice on student action and fix 
the process. :
I do not doubt the capacity of my peers to man
age our money. But let us mortar the bricks with 
documentation. A whole new Senate presides; 
gavel in fist. r>

THE TARTAN  APRIL 21,2003
Late April lets fans enjoy draft, draught
ymIue CmIImvoc
Its coming, just one week away 
now. The biggest off-season event in 
any sport next to the NBA lottery is 
rapidly approaching, and Im not 
nearly as excited as I should be. 
Normally on the eve of the NFL draft, 
Im more than prepared for the event. 
But this year, like last year, there is no 
surprise as to who the number one 
pick will be. The Texans made a great 
choice with David Carr last year, but 
the Bengals this year are making a 
mistake by eyeing Carson Palmer. No 
sense in jumping into the heart of the 
fyeast just yet though.
The NFL draft is without a doubt 
the most interesting (albeit over
hyped) off-season event in any sport. 
In order for the draft to be entertain
ing you have to. watch it in a certain 
way. Here are a few rules for a good 
draft day: 1) Watch it with an Eagles 
fan and constantly bring up the fact 
they all booed when the Birds picked 
Donavan McNabb over Ricky 
Williams despite the fact that D-Nabb 
is the best thing to happen to Philly in 
a long time. 2) For the top ten picks, 
shout loudly that the team has made 
a horrible mistake and come up with 
some BS reason why. 3) Be loud and 
obnoxious. 4) Pray to the Yinzer God 
that the Stillers get a decent defen
sive back. 5) Drink beer. If you drink 
enough beer, you might just agree 
with what I have to say.
Cincinnati is making a mistake. 
Even though Im not drunk or loud 
yet, I still know the Bengals do not 
need a quarterback, particularly 
Carson Palmer. He was great at USC 
because of the support he had, and 
that network does not exist in Cincy. 
They need a receiver like Charles 
Rogers, or defensive help. Terrell
Early first-round pick predictions
1CincinnatiCarson Palmer QB USC
2DetroitCharles Rogers WR Mich. St.
3HoustonAndre Johnson WR Miami
4ChicagoDewayne Robertson DT Kentucky
5DallasByron Leftwich QB Marshall
6ArizonaTerrell Suggs DE Arizona St.
7MinnesotaTerence Newman CB Kansas St.
8JacksonvilleMarcus Trufant CB Wash. St.
9CarolinaJordan Gross OT Utah
10BaltimoreJimmy Kennedy DT Penn St.
Suggs was the answer, until he 
slumped in front of scouts; now I 
would recommend the Bengals draft 
Rogers and let the capable Kitna run 
the team until next year.
And while I think Charles Rogers 
should go to the Bengals, he wont. 
Hell end up in Houston or Detroit, 
and will have a prosperous career at 
either place. Both have great young 
QBs, and both teams are looking up. 
Dont worry about the drug-test inci
dent; this kid will make me look stu
pid when I shout about how wrong it 
was to take him so early.
For the league in general, the line
backer selection may be a touch 
weak, though the defense in this 
draft is quite good. From Suggs (who 
will be a great player) to the two 
potential top-10 corners (Newman 
and Trufant) this year looks to be a 
solid year for teams in need of D.
Offensively, Byron Leftwich 
trumps Carson Palmer as the best QB 
in the draft. For a struggling team 
Palmer brings very little to the table;
Bum Lee/Art Editor
he needs good receivers and a good 
O-Line in order to be effective. He 
isnt Payton Manning. Most of the 
QBs entering the draft follow suit, 
but not Leftwich. He has the talent to 
turn a team around, and he will; just 
wait and see. Willis McGahee, had he 
not injured himself, would be a top 3 
pick for sure, and even still he should 
go early in the first round. He says 
hes ready to play, and plenty of 
teams with the top picks could use a 
running back.
Some early teams that could land 
him: Houston (unlikely), Chicago 
(although I think theyll look for OLine or Defense), Carolina, or even 
Minnesota. A team with a pick in the 
20s could land him because of the 
knee concerns though. If hes avail
able the Stillers should steal him with 
the 27th pick.

down, 7-5, 6-2, while Carl Yang won 
[easily, 6-3, 6-0, at third singles.
Today, the Tartan women will host 
Allegheny College, but they shouldnt 
face much resistance  the team 
played Allegheny back in September, 
and the Tartan women came away 
with a 6-0 shutout. The men will host 
Case Western Reserve on Tuesday 
since their match last Tuesday was 
canceled.
We havent played them since last
years UAA tournament when we beat 
them, but theyve gotten many new 
people and are supposed to be a lot 
tougher this year, said Sofman about 
the matchup. It will provide a solid 
final warmup before the the UAA 
Championships, which will begin on 
Friday at Washington University. 
Ehrlich said that the team has been 
improving as the championship 
approaches.
As the season is winding down, we 
are starting to turn the corner a little 
bit, he said. The teams starting
freshmen have also matured signifi
cantly, he said, and will be able to 
better handle the pressure of the 
tournament.
The teams will leave for St. Louis 
on Thursday, but before then, they 
will try to get some workouts in. In 
their practices, the men will attempt 
to address this weekends doubles 
troubles.
After this weekend, we decided 
that the things we need to work on 
next [are] our net games in doubles 
situations, said Sofman.
AL Central issues: Roy ah finally coronated?
CENTRAL, from page A14
touch with everyone else in the divi
sion. After 15 games, Detroit has just 
a single win and is an amazing 11 
games behind the Royals. Like the 
Royals, the Tigers have only played 
teams within the Central, but have 
had the misfortune of mostly taking 
on the contenders, going 0-6 against 
Minnesota and 1-5 against Chicago 
with the three losses to K.C. thrown 
in for good measure.
Things are likely to get worse 
before they get better for Detroit. 
After finishing the weekend series 
against K.C., the Tigers head straight 
out to Oakland with a follow-up stop 
in Seattle. The Tigers do have a 
decent opportunity to lick their 
wounds afterwards, though, with a 
nice stretch against Baltimore and
Tampa Bay starting at home, but 
there is a very real chance that 
Detroit could finish April with less 
than five wins.
More troubling for Detroit, howev
er, are the attendance figures for the 
early part of the season. While the 
Red Wings pushed their consecutive 
sellout streak to 280-plus games 
across town, the Tigers have already 
had two crowds of less than 10,000. 
Even their opening series was a strug
gle. After drawing a hefty 40,427 for 
game one, the Tigers saw attendance 
drop to 21,123 for game two and a 
measly 8,862 for game three.
The most recent home series, 
against Chicago, was at least more 
consistent, drawing between 12,500 
and 13,000 for all three games, but 
the numbers still arent good. Poor 
attendance has been reflected
around the league; the season-open
ing series between Seattle and 
Oakland drew a paltry 6,295 fans for 
the final game, and only a few teams 
have maintained consistent crowds 
above 20,000.
Part of the problem could be the 
poor early-season weather in many 
baseball cities, as well as the overlap 
with the NHL and NBA playoffs, but 
poor attendance, while great for us 
die-hard fans who find it that much 
easier to get tickets, is a serious prob
lem for a league already in dire finan
cial straits.
Matt Brun (mbrun@) regrets ending 
his penultimate column on such a 
down note, but promises lots of levity 
and good-natured reminiscing next 
week in his final effort before gradua
tion.

In the fourth inning, the Tartans 
started to come back. Corbett, junior 
shortstop Will Bennett, and Britton 
were all walked to load the bases. 
First-year Dan Noday hit a single to 
knock two runs in. They continued 
their comeback with two more fiverun innings. The first seven batters 
got on base on three walks, an error, 
and three hits  including a double 
by Bogard, who was seven for nine in 
the double-header and who is hit
ting an unbelievable .500 this sea
son.
The sixth inning was short for the 
Tartan offense, but again in the sev
enth, they started with a hit. Firstyear catcher Pete Sukits hit into a 6- 
4-3 double-play. The next seven got 
on base, and five scored to put CMU
up 14-8. NYU got two runs in the 
bottom of the seventh as Hamilton 
got the relief win.
Weve been able to get in a lot of 
games this spring, said junior 
infielder Brian Volz. Now that weve 
gotten into the sixth and seventh 
games, people have seen a lot of

First-year pitcher Jack Bader winds-up in his complete game victory in the first half of the teams weekend doubleheader 
against NYU on Saturday. In seven innings pitched, Bader gave up five earned runs and struck out four Violets.
by Adam Greenberg
Sports Editor
Smarting from recent budget 
cuts, the Carnegie Mellon baseball 
team went on their marquee trip of 
the season, heading to Brooklyn to 
play New York University in an 
interscholastic club doubleheader.
'NYU is regarded as the best 
Division III club team ... from 
schools with no varsity team, said 
Dan Bogard, senior second-base
man and the teams president.
At both ends of the doubleheader, 
the Tartans, who are midway 
through their season, came out vic
torious after high-scoring games. 
The teams offense has been strong 
lately and has scored 12 or more 
runs in each of the clubs last four 
games.
Our offense is just coming alive, 
said Bogard. Everybodys hitting 
the ball.
In the opening game, the team 
started first-year Jack Bader on the 
mound. His performance was spec
tacular and he finished with a com
plete game having allowed only five 
earned runs.
The first two innings on offense 
for the Tartans were somewhat 
uneventful, but in the third inning, 
they took off, scoring seven runs on 
eight hits. The team had six consec
utive batters reach base, including 
first-year Matt Corbett, who hit his 
second double of the game. Corbett 
is hitting .318 this year and was four 
for six over the weekend.
The Violets closed the gap to 8-5 
after the fifth inning, when they had 
three walks issued, but they were 
not able to catch up because 
Carnegie Mellon scored four more 
times in the sixth. The Tartans sixth 
inning opened with four consecu
tive hits; each of those players 
scored, though the rest of the order 
did not get hits in the inning  with
three outs, and two players reaching 
base on a walk and an error. This 
gave them a 12-5 lead, insurmount
able by the Violet offense.
In the second game, the Tartans 
started junior Zach Britton as pitch
er. The team got into some trouble 
early in the game when Britton was 
unable to get a ground out until the 
11th batter of the inning. New York
scored seven to take a five-run lead 
and Britton was moved out to first 
base with third-baseman Charlie 
Hamilton coming in to take the 
mound. The second and third 
innings were the only one-two-three 
innings of the afternoon for 
Carnegie Mellon.

Schilling requires 
emergency surgery
ST. LOUIS (AP)  Arizona 
Diamondbacks pitcher Curt Schilling 
underwent an appendectomy 
Saturday during the teams game 
against the St. Louis Cardinals, but 
might miss only one start.
Schilling was in pain on Friday 
when the team arrived for the start of 
a three-game series, and manager 
Bob Brenly said the pain was more 
acute on Saturday. Cardinals team 
doctors recommended surgery.
Obviously, it was something we 
couldnt afford to put off for another 
couple days, Brenly said. The doc
tors that came over from the St. Louis 
side recommended that they do it 
right away.
A team spokesman characterized 
the operation as a routine proce
dure. Schilling could be released 
from Barnes-Jewish Hospital as soon 
as Sunday but likely wont return to 
Arizona until Tuesday or Wednesday.
Schilling, 36, has won 45 games 
over the last two years. He was 23-7 
last year with a 3.23 ER.
This year, hes 1-2 with a 4.28 
ERA. Schilling had been scheduled to 
pitch Wednesday against the Expos.
Lukass Stakes win 
sends him to Derby
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP)  
Scrimshaw took the lead in the final 
furlong and beat Eye of the Tiger by 
three lengths in the Grade II 
Lexington at Keeneland on Saturday, 
giving trainer D. Wayne Lukas a lastminute entry into the Kentucky 
Derby.
Scrimshaw gave trainer D. Wayne 
Lukas his third Lexington win in five 
years. For the second year in a row, 
Lukas appeared to be out of Derby 
contenders. But just like Proud 
Citizen last year, Scrimshaw came 
through with a victory that will allow 
Lukas to try and win the Derby on 
May 3 for the fifth time.
This will be the 22nd time in 23 
years that he will have a Derby starter.
This race sets up well for us, 
Lukas said. I have never thought you 
had to look good in February. This 
race fits our program. I knew I was 
behind the eight ball with this horse. 
But he has a lot of talent. I always 
thought he was our best horse.
At 6-1, Scrimshaw went off as the 
fourth choice in the seven-horse field 
for the $325,000-added Lexington 
Stakes. The son of Gulch easily held 
off Eye of the Tiger and Domestic 
Dispute.
Nothing is over until its over, 
said jockey Edgar Prado, who rode 
Scrimshaw. Thats why they call it 
horse racing. Everything worked out 
beautifully.
Ministers Wild Cat bumped 
Scrimshaw near the first turn. 
Scrimshaw stayed behind pace-set
ting Trust N Luck and Ministers Wild 
Cat until the top of the stretch, when 
he moved three wide and took over.
Oakland petitions 
for uniform ruling
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP)  The 
Oakland Raiders have asked a judge 
to prevent the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
and the Carolina Panthers from wear
ing their uniforms for games in 
California because they violate the 
Raiders trademark rights.
The Raiders claim Tampa Bays 
pirate logo is too similar to Oaklands, 
and the Raiders object to the 
Panthers uniforms because two col
ors  silver and black  match those 
of the Raiders.
NFL spokesman Joe Browne said 
the issue is one of a handful that 
remain from a 1996 suit by the 
Raiders listing multiple grievances 
against the league. Some were trans
ferred to courts in Los Angeles, where 
another Raiders case against the 
league is being fought.
Papers filed by the Raiders in the 
San Jose case say the Buccaneers 
logo is likely to dilute the distinctive 
quality of the Raiders mark, thereby 
lessening its capacity to identify the 
Raiders and causing irreparable harm 
that cannot adequately be compen
sated by an award of damages.
NFL attorneys argued there will 
always be overlap among logos and 
colors. One of them, James Hunt, 
said, Michigan could say any uni
forms featuring predatory cats 
would be prohibited in that state.
If California tells Tampa Bay to 
wear a new uniform for games here,

Mens and womens tennis split clash with Division I opponent
by Christopher Chung
Contributing Editor
The womens tennis team rolled 
over Division I Mount St. Marys 
College (MSM) 7-0 on Saturday 
during the teams last weekend 
before the UAA Championships in 
St. Louis this coming weekend. In 
mens action, the Tartans played 
well but couldnt win in doubles 
competition, suffering a 4-3 loss to 
Mount St. Marys mens team.
First-year Alison Liu led the 
Tartan women (10-12) in the first 
singles slot on Saturday, handily 
defeating MSMs Kelli Louis, 6-4, 
6-1.
At second singles, senior 
Elizabeth Weiss had a little more dif
ficulty, but came away with a victo
ry. Because of time constraints, the 
teams decided to play super tie
breakers if players split sets. Weiss 
won her first set, 6-4, but could not 
hold on in the second. She ended up 
winning the tie-breaker, 10-4.
Sophomore Ann Kozlowski held 
her own at third singles, placing a 
close 7-5 in the first set, and shut
ting out her opponent in the second.
The last three singles victories 
were decisive as well. Over the
course of the three straight-set wins, 
Tartan players only lost three 
games.
It was a nice match, especially 
since they were Division I and we 
were missing our number one and 
two players, said Weiss. 
Sophomore Christina Weng and 
senior Annie Bosler, the womens 
first and second singles players, 
were not in action Saturday.
The Tartan men did not have the 
same success against Mount St. 
Marys, losing all their doubles 
matches. The two teams were tied 
3-3 after singles play, but the 
Tartans could not pull off any dou
bles wins. Mount St. Marys barely 
took the first and second doubles 
matches, 8-5 and 9-7.
If a couple of shots went in, it 
would have been very possible for 
us to win, but we were playing 
against a savvy and veteran team, 
said junior first-singles player Steve 
Ehrlich. Ehrlich and sophomore 
Boris Sofman had a 5^4 lead on 
their opponents before giving way.
The only relatively easy wins for 
the Carnegie Mellon men came at 
second and third singles. Sofman 
took his second singles opponent

AL Central 
yields wide 
margin early
scrr enbl
It is with a heavy heart that I return 
to baseball coverage this week, since 
my hockey season is, for all intents 
and purposes, over. Watching my 
beloved Red Wings flame out in the 
first round  failing to win a single 
game against the Mighty Ducks, of all 
teams  was tough, but if being a 
Cleveland fan has taught me any
thing, its how to deal with a losing 
team. In fact, the Wings three recent 
championship seasons have been the 
most difficult to deal with; I dont 
know how to react to my team being a 
winner.
Anyway, after a week of just casual
ly checking scores, my full attention 
returned to baseball, and imagine my 
surprise to see that 15 games into the 
season, the Kansas City Royals are not 
only still leading the AL Central, but 
only have three losses. Considering 
that the Royals had three losses after 
just four games last year and took 34 
games to reach their current total of
12 wins, this turnaround demanded 
further analysis.
Statistically, the Royals are lightyears ahead of last years pace. If they 
keep up their current rate, the boys 
from K.C. will smash 65 more home 
runs and score 94 more runs than last 
years squad. The pitching staff has 
also gotten off to a fast start; the 
staffs ERA is over two runs lower 
than last years, and, if current trends 
hold, they will strike out 171 more 
opposing batters.
As encouraging as that sounds, fast 
starts are usually just that: starts. 
Maintaining their present pace over 
147 more games will be more than a 
little bit challenging for the Royals. 
Consider also that the Royals impres
sive record hasnt been built against 
the top end of the American League 
talent pool. So far, Kansas City has 
only played against teams within 
their own division, and have not 
faced the defending division champi
on Twins. Yes, the Royals are 4-2 
against a legitimate contender in the 
White Sox, but the rest of their record 
has come from 5-1 and 3-0 splits 
against the Indians and Tigers, 
respectively.
The next few weeks will begin to 
show what the Royals are really made 
of as they play two three-game series 
each against Minnesota, Boston, 
Baltimore, and Toronto. This is actu
ally a nice scheduling run for Kansas 
City, since Baltimore and Toronto are 
nothing to write home about and 
could be a nice break between the 
more important series with the Red 
Sox and Twins.
Right on the heels of the last series 
against Toronto, however, is a 12- 
game stretch exclusively against 
Oakland and Seattle, beginning with 
a West Coast trip through both cities. 
Following that is the first round of 
interleague match-ups, pitting the 
Royals against the tough NL West. By 
the middle of June, the Royals could 
find themselves crashing back to 
earth while still not having played the 
Yankees or the defending champion 
Angels.
On the other end of the AL Central 
spectrum, things are a little more nor
mal as the Tigers are already losing

Carnival corrections:
Setting the record straight
In the Carnival issue of The Tartan, several errors were made, particularly in regards to the Booth 
and Buggy coverage. The Tartan corrects all known errors of fact and will display disruptive and 
misleading errors in a prominent location to provide a reliable chronicle of Carnegie Mellons peo
ple and history. The Tartan regrets the inaccuracies in last weeks issue, and salutes the entire cam
pus for putting together a memorable weekend that featured excellent music, clean buggy rolls, 
and booths that towered over past years in many respects.
In the Carnival Insert:
On page 4 in the left column, the subject of the photograph is misidentified. The student shown is 
Shanna Tellerman, an art senior, and pushed hill five for Pi Kappa Alpha. Danielle Sinclair, a jun
ior chemical engineering major, was identified as the subject, but she actually pushed hill one for 
PiKA.
On page 7 in the right column, the subject of the photograph is misidentified. The student shown 
is Crystal Hall, a senior social and decision sciences major, who pushed for Student Dormitory 
Council.
In the booth coverage on pages eight to 11, the standings are incorrect. Kappa Delta Rho won sec
ond place in the booth competition, not Phi Kappa Theta. KDR also won Best in Show.
On page 9 in the right column, the "Forbidden City' booth is credited to Sigma Tau Rho. Sigma Tau 
Rho does not exist. The fraternity who built the booth was Sigma Tau Gamma.
On page 11 in the left column, the "Escape from Alcatraz" booth is credited to Sigma Epsilon. 
Sigma Epsilon does not exist. The fraternity who built the booth was Sigma Phi Epsilon.
The photograph on the back cover of Pillbox was taken by J.T. Trollman.

ALMANAC.
JO YEARS AGO
Plans were finalized for a new dorm to be built on the site of 
the old Tech Inn. The dorm, which was named Donner Hall, was 
also to include the field house and locker rooms for the Tech 
Bowl on its lowest floor. Construction was planned to start in 
August, but contractual problems delayed groundbreaking for 
nearly three months.
25 YEARS AGO
President Richard Cyert met with students regarding several cam
pus issues. Students feared cancellation of popular courses and 
commented on the Universitys unsatisfactory library and recre
ational spaces. In addition, University Vice President Richard Van 
Horn announced that campus mailboxes would be centralized in 
the east entrance to Baker Hall.
1 YEARS AGO
Alpha Epsilon Pi and Sigma Tau Gamma started the application 
process for the house at 1091 Morewood Avenue, which had 
been vacated when Alpha Tau Omega was suspended from liv
ing in University housing. Both fraternities spoke about their 
qualifications before a special committee charged with allocat
ing the space. At the time, SigTau was located in Doherty 
Apartments and AEPi resided with the sororities.
5 YEARS AGO
There was an explosion in Doherty Hall 1201 when doctoral 
student Kristen Buehler mistakenly mixed two waste chemi
cals under a fume hood. As she retrieved more chemicals, the 
bottle started to hiss and the gas pressure exploded the bot
tle, throwing glass around the room and spraying acid on her 
clothes. The chemicals did not come into direct contact with 
her skin and Buehler was not injured.
1 YEAR AGO
CIVU students met to discuss relations between groups of stu

Make way, Spider Man
One masked do-gooder helps to improve the Pittsburgh community through magic tricks
Its a magician! Its a juggling man on rollerblades! Its a masked superhero! Its 
Burgh Man! This local Pittsburgh celebrity has been hitting the streets to enter
tain people for the past two years, masquerading as a self-invented comic book 
hero, vending his juggling kit and teaching others how to juggle, plate spinning 
for spectators, and singing songs of social justice and reform.
Originally, Burgh Man got his masters degree in counseling from Duquesne 
University and became a therapist for mental health and drug and alcohol abuse 
patients. After practicing for 15 years, he said that he felt it was time to take a 
more pro-active and preventative role in the fight against drugs, alcohol, and 
violence.
Burgh Man decided to get to the root of the problem to save more kids, like a real 
superhero. He believes that if you teach kids positive and healthy activities such 
as juggling, athletics, reading, music, or magic tricks, then they will choose that 
path over experimenting with harmful substances. The Burgh Man has invested 
much of his own time and resources into creating his real-life superhero persona: 
the costume, the Burgh Van, and the comic book series, which he created him
self.
Burgh Mans first comic book highlighted the many firsts of Pittsburgh, such as 
the first radio station (KDKA), the first drive-through gas station, and the first 
movie theater.
You know, I never read a lot of comic books, said Burgh Man, but I created a 
superhero because I knew people love superheroes, and I thought I could get my 
message across through Burgh Man.
He hopes that Burgh Man will serve as a model program for other cities to adopt 
so that they might create their own local superheroes to be role models for kids.
Burgh Mans own heroes were Perry Mason, because he loved the law, and 
Superman, because he always stood for things that were right and good. Its fair 
to say that Burgh Man is now walking in the footsteps of his own superheroes, 
personifying and promoting everything thats good about Pittsburgh and life in 
general. Like most comic book superheroes, Burgh Mans efforts to make the city 
a better place are not going unrecognized. In 2002, Gene Ricciardi of City 
Council proclaimed October 8 to be Burgh Man Day in honor of the local hero.
Pittsburgh steel probably built America. I try to be an ambassador to the world 
to show people what a great town we have, said the superhero.
The multi-talented Burgh Man does much of his act on rollerblades.
Im trying to get into the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only jug
gling rollerblader in the world, he said. Its part of my entertainment to be able 
to juggle and rollerblade at the same time.
Of course, a superhero has to have his colors, so everything I wear is black and 
gold because its representative of Pittsburgh colors, he said. So why does Burgh 
Man wear the black and gold mask?
I wear the mask because Im actually Mayor Murphy, he said, laughing. He said 
he wouldnt reveal his alter-egos name and identity  a real Clark Kent and 
Superman charade. He is, after all, a superhero with a cause, touting the mighty 
motto for kids, Be smart. Dont start.
[Burgh Mans goal is to] show kids what talents and gifts they have. Burgh Man 
has a certain psychology to him because of my experience. I take a holistic 
approach, he said. At least I know Im planting seeds, so I really think Burgh 
Man and his whole persona really is impacting children, and after all, thats real
ly our future: children. I try to develop their minds in a very healthy way  
focusing on their positives rather than their negatives.
Next time you see this unmistakable Pittsburgh superhero on the street, give him 
a cheer for the steps hes taken to make our city a better place and for being a real 
live hero for many people, young and old.
Burgh Man can be found at the Pittsburgh Comic Book Festival at the 
Monroeville ExpoMart, at the March of Dimes, and at the Shadyside/Ellsworth 
Arts Festival.

Steinway:
Carnegie Mellons preferred piano
A Steinway piano is one-of-a-kind. Each piano is built by hand, and artisans 
spend nearly a year perfecting every one.
Because theyre handmade, every piano is a little different. So a piano that one 
pianist loves, another may say, Id never play that, said Alan Fletcher, head of 
the School of Music. But despite a variety of preferences for Steinways, many 
musicians agree that the Steinway is the finest piano in the world.
For high-level musical work, you just have to have a Steinway, said Fletcher.
The School of Music is committed to buying only Steinways and owns about 70 
of them. As one of 29 universities named all-Steinway schools, Carnegie 
Mellon receives the pianos at a discounted price, along with special services 
from the company. This year, Steinway and Sons sent a team from New York to 
evaluate the Universitys piano maintenance program for free.
Some of the most notable conservatories in the nation share the honor, includ
ing the Juilliard School of Music, Oberlin College Conservatory, and the Yale 
School of Music.
Fletcher said that CMUs School of Music began phasing out other pianos and 
replacing them with Steinways a few years ago. The story of the Steinway piano 
itself, however, is much older. In 1853, German immigrant Henry Engelhard 
Steinway, a cabinet maker, began building them in his Manhattan home. The 
first piano he ever sold went for $500.
Today, Concert Steinways go for around $90,000. The School of Music has five. 
Most of the pianos on campus, however, are less expensive, and can be found in 
the practice rooms instead of on the stage.
Ashley Leight, a sophomore piano performance major, said the title allSteinway school gives incoming freshmen the wrong idea. Theyre not 
Steinways, she said. Theyre not worthy.
According to Leight, the pianos are in dire need of tuning and other mainte
nance. First-year Victoria Long, a violin major, said that the keys dont work, the 
pianos are always out of tune, and the feel is inconsistent across the keyboard.
Id rather have one good Yamaha than five awful Steinways, Long said.
Senior Abigail Schoppe, a piano major, said she is frustrated with the pianos as 
well, but said her experience with playing them may help her to be a better musi
cian.
If youre a good musician, you should be able to deal with [instruments] that 
arent in perfect condition.
Enrique Graf, a professor of piano at the School of Music, said that a piano, like 
a race car, needs to be perfecdy tuned and adjusted in order to run smoothly. 
Temperature and humidity variances in the building play tricks on the wood, 
felt, and metal that make up the pianos.
It is impossible to keep them in top shape, said Graf, unless there was a huge 
staff of full-time technicians to take care of them as you would a race car that 
would get that kind of use. So accidents happen more often than pianists would 
like. While a great piano is one of the best investments anyone can make, most 
people do not realize the expense that it means for an institution like CMU to

keep them up.
Every piano is played nearly 18 hours a day, and as a result requires frequent tun
ing. Additionally, the pianos are not always kept at room temperature because of 
the schools unusual heating system, said Fletcher. With only one piano techni
cian, consistent maintenance is hard to come by. Fletcher said administrators are 
discussing ways to resolve these issues with the help of Steinway and Sons.
Leight said she thinks the school should relinquish the tide and purchase less 
expensive pianos. There are other name-brand pianos that are sufficient, she 
said, suggesting a Baldwin or Yamaha. Yet, if she had the choice, she would 
choose to play on a Steinway  one that is maintained properly.
She explained that the hammer on a Steinway resets itself so that the musician 
does not have to lift his or her fingers completely off the keys to play another 
note.
You can play a fast scale and hear every note, said Leight.
This makes for a clear sound, one that is often described as loud and full. 
Commenting on the rich, buttery sound of a Steinway, Fletcher said, A friend 
of mine, whos a great pianist, calls it cholesterol rich.
The quality of the sound is pretty distinguishable, said Graf. Warm, powerful, 
huge dynamic range. The American Steinway is ideal to perform in big halls and 
as a soloist with orchestras because of those same reasons.
Steinways are strong instruments. Fletcher said a Steinway is ideal for a sweep
ing Rachmaninoff piece with difficult technical elements and large chords. A 
Steinway can last 50 or 60 years, if maintained well.
But right now, Leight said, Theyre taking a beating.

Brotherly love in the music
Punk-rock vs. the ballad
Photo courtesy of The Blood Brothers.
Thomas Carlyle, author of the magisterial On 
Heroes and Hero Worship, observed somewhere 
along the way that the mystic bond of brotherhood 
makes all men one. Easier said than done, Tom. In 
the world of music, it takes a fair bit more than shar
ing a love for chords or cacophony to produce any 
discerning similarity. In the case of The Blood 
Brothers and Two Gentlemen of the Road (Jimmy 
MacBeath and Davie Stewart), the mystic bond is 
shattered into a million pieces, put through a shred
der, and set on liquify in the musicological blender. 
The result couldnt be clearer: The Blood Brothers 
and Two Gentlemen of the Road share no fraternal 
ties.
On their major record debut, Burn, Piano Island, 
Burn, The Blood Brothers make the most of their 
discordant blend of post-punk angst and passionate 
performance style. Unfortunately, this isnt good 
enough to bust them out of the swamp of thousands 
of other bands who sound just like The Blood 
Brothers and probably write better songs. The Blood 
Brothers sound like a mix of hyper-punk and altgothic, with a house cat tossed into a wood chipper 
for good measure. Their devastating style, though 
aurally beautiful at times, just cant get beyond the 
screech-owl vocals of singer Jordan Blilie. The avantgarde attitude doesnt help, either  The Blood 
Brothers combine abstruse lyrics and clever cover art 
to set themselves up for scores of At The Drive-In and 
The Mars Volta comparisons. In the end, however, 
The Blood Brothers mood changes coupled with 
their semi-original melody digressions are not
enough to salvage the vocals enervating effects. 
Some of the lyrics  Id like to wrap my arms 
around you like a flesh canopy  come across not 
as moody, but downright silly, and bubble over with 
enough fatuities to fill an Oliver Stone film. Burn, 
Piano Island, Burn was produced by Ross Robinson, 
fresh off stints with Iowas heaviest metal band, 
Slipknot, and those originators of the flesh-eating 
virus known as rap-rock, Limp Bizkit. Robinson is 
known in the business for handling the hardest acts, 
and The Blood Brothers are definitely hard. 
Unfortunately, they are also hard to digest, appreci
ate, and replay. The albums best track, Every 
Breath is a Bomb, with its heartfelt interludes, cant 
seem to breathe life into the stillbirth that The Blood 
Brothers major label debut ultimately is.
Transitioning across the Atlantic Ocean, Two 
Gentlemen of the Road is an album/historical account 
of Jimmy MacBeath and Davie Stewart, a pair of 
Scottish folksingers who spent most of their days 
traveling the roads of Britain, Northern Ireland, and 
the burns of their homeland. The two-disc set of 
personal history, traditional stories, and ballads is 
part of the Alan Lomax Collection, and follows the 
famed ethnomusicologists vision to a tee.
Lomax was always something of a collector, and 
throughout his journeys, he acquired field record
ings, world music compilations, ballad operas, arias, 
and plaintive bluesy wails. Indeed, he is credited 
with discovering certain talents, be it Woody 
Guthrie and his Okie tunes or Leadbelly and the 
folksy country blues that he helped to usher in. If 
youre a folk artist, a down-at-heeler, or just a skilled 
raconteur, Lomax will find you, as he always does.
The formula for the album is straightforward enough
 the first disc describes the hardscrabble life of the 
two old saws as they made their living on the road. 
One of the best, Old Bodies, Five or Six Pounds 
Each, is a macabre tale of berkers, body snatchers 
that prey on the living and not-so-living. Irish histo
ry, and to a lesser extent Scottish history, has always 
relied on its great palette of words to keep it alive.
MacBeath and Stewart are no strangers to a good 
story; the first disc is besotted with stories your 
grandfather might whisper to you by the fireplace. 
Lomax, to his credit, is an accomplished interviewer 
endowed with a unique ability to pry every last sylla
Pixxarpe 21 sPdix 2003.
ble out of his subjects. The second disc contains a 
few more songs than the first, including two short 
ballads, My Darling Ploughman Boy and DarkEyed Lover, which are arguably the best ones on the 
album. MacBeath and Stewart rarely sing together 
on the discs, instead allowing one another to take 
turns in Lomaxs recording booth. MacBeath has a 
booming, husky tenor and normally sings in the 
worker tradition, a style rich in mood and voice. 
Stewart, on the other hand, tends towards more of 
an agile style of singing, dancing with his words in 
the Irish Traveler tradition of fluidity and tall-taletelling that makes every song seem less like a tune 
and more like a secret shared between friends.
If hyper-artsy scream-core is your bag, then The 
Blood Brothers might be for you. Beware, however: 
the incompleteness of the album, in terms of both 
songwriting and vocals, makes for sloppy listening. 
Jimmy MacBeath and Davie Stewart represent a dif
ferent spin on the oral tradition of storytelling and 
singing. The mystic bond that these two gentlemen 
of the road share is stronger than brothers' blood, 
and in the end creates a musical experience worthy 
of old-fashioned brotherly love.

Cutting edge film festival:
A preview to whats coming up in this years student-run Splice film festival
On Tuesday, April 22, the Carnegie Mellon community will begin a six-day film 
festival titled Splice. In moviemaking, the term splice refers to a method used 
in the editing process in which two pieces of film are cut apart and later taped to 
other segments of film. Similarly, the festival combines different styles of movies 
including rare displays of independent (indie) film, debuting student films, and 
well-known indie masterpieces.
We also wanted to show films that can be hard to find or that are simply underappreciated and have less of a popular following, said Jesse Dubus, a senior 
BHA student with concentrations in French and music who is the head of the 
selection committee for the film festival.
Dubus has been preparing the film festival along with 25 other students in his 
film class led by Melissa Ragona, a visiting faculty member in Film Studies and 
English. A different department takes charge of the film festival each year, alter
nating between the history, modem languages, and English departments. This 
year the festival is being run by the English Department, which is also funding 
Splice.
Dubus began to take an active interest in movies in high school. He has had 
internships at film festivals and has taken film classes outside of Carnegie 
Mellon. He believes his career will most likely be in film one way or another.
From the selection of movies playing at the festival, Dubus pointed out two films 
that are considered milestones: 1959s Shadows and 1977s Killer of Sheep. 
Shadows is considered the first American independent film. Its director, John 
Cassavetes, was an actor in Hollywood and the host of a radio show. He received
funding for his project from his listeners, who each sent him a dollar to support 
his project. The movie was well received critically.
Killer of Sheep is a less well-known masterwork, and Charles Burnett, its director, 
is highly acclaimed among film scholars. Killer of Sheep will screen on Thursday, 
April 24 at 5 pm, while Shadows will screen on Friday, April 25 at 9 pm. All of the 
movies are to be shown in McConomy Auditorium.
Many members of the Carnegie Mellon community have been involved in the 
preparation of Splice. Jeff Hinkelman, who is the Video Collection Manager at 
Hunt Library, helped Dubus and his classmates locate and order copies of many 
of the films shown during the festival. While the festival has mainly been creat
ed and funded by students and faculty of Carnegie Mellon, its organizers also 
wish to gain audiences beyond the University community.
We have done a good job at getting the word out to the rest of the city, said 
Dubus.
Splice will open on Tuesday, April 22, with an opening reception with filmmak
er Yvonne Rainer on the third floor of the Regina Miller Gallery. On Wednesday, 
April 23, an annual display of student film will take place starting at 5 pm. 
Admission is $1 for students and $3 for non-students. Passes for the week are 
also available: $7 for students, $14 for non-students.

Lara Croft returns:
Angelina iolie talks about how this sequel will pan out
Box, a mystical object that could lead to the end of the world if it falls into the 
wrong hands. Jolie said that Tomb Raider's negative reviews by critics led the team 
for The Cradle of Life to think things over a bit more. They wanted the sequel to be 
more parallel with the game and also wanted the image of Lara to be more realis
tic and athletic, as opposed to the voluptuous cartoon that was seen on the silver 
screen two years ago.
In the first Tomb Raider, they really had to persuade me into the shorts, she said, 
laughing, and even once they did, I was still uncomfortable. It took me a while 
before I could be confident and walk with my head up high. Its still strange.
The physical demands on Jolie for The Cradle of Life have increased since she is 
now a mother. Her son Maddox is her joy and she said that the film took much of 
her time and strength. For physical training, she not only practiced martial arts 
but kick boxing as well.
Her diet consisted of mostly proteins and protein powders. In the morning, she 
would eat beans, eggs, and bacon for endurance before going to workout. Jolie 
wanted to try doing some of her own stunts in The Cradle of Life, one of which was 
a sequence of scenes on jet skis, and the other which consisted of shooting a rifle 
while riding on horseback. Jolie commented that she was not fond of the jet ski 
scenes initially since she isnt comfortable with watersports. However, after it was 
done, she was glad that she had accomplished it.
Jolie said the scenes of The Cradle of Life are visually stimulating, which according 
to her is a requirement for a movie such as this one. Taking place in the scenic 
ambiances of Hong Kong, Kenya, Tanzania, Greece, and Wales, the movie will 
strive not only to be rich with action, but also with color and life.
These are not the only places where Jolie has traveled recently. Jolie has been in 
Colombo, Sri Lanka as a humanitarian, helping the Lankans pursue their goal of 
attaining peace. She has been assisting them in building homes and health facili
ties. Jolie started traveling heavily about three years ago and said that it has com
pletely changed her outlook on life.
Now is the time to [help other] people, she said. Traveling helps me to stay con
nected to life, how these peoples spirits are so unbroken. These are the heroes to 
me.
Jolie has been fortunate to play in a variety of roles during her acting career in 
both the dramatic and action categories. She has never feared being typecast 
because she is aware of her stronger qualities and said that she is simply happy 
with working as an actress.
Girl, Interupted and Beyond Borders are so different from [The Cradle of Life], she 
said. This film allows me to be playful and active again.
The World of Tomorrow (sci-fi/thriller) and Sharkslayer (animation/comedy) are 
the projects Jolie currendy has tailgating The Cradle of Life. Her co-stars for The 
World of Tomorrow include Jude Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley), Gwyneth Paltrow 
(The Royal Tenenbaums), Ling Bai (Anna and the King), and Casey Affleck (Oceans 
Eleven). Sharkslayer's cast will include Will Smith (Enemy of the State), Robert 
De Niro (The Score), Jack Black (High Fidelity), Martin Scorsese (director of 
Goodfellas), and Rene Zellweger (Chicago). The World of Tomorrow and 
Sharkslayer are expected to hit theaters in 2004.

The tagline for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider was Who is Lara Croft? When the first 
trailer played in theaters and posters were distributed in stores, there was no 
doubt that Lara Croft was Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider, Original Sin, Girl, 
Interrupted). On July 25 of this summer, Jolie will become her alter ego yet again 
in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.
There is a very English sense about [Lara Croft], said Jolie in a conference call 
held last Thursday. I got into the lady side of England and the warrior side of 
martial arts.
The Cradle of Life, directed by Jan de Bont (The Haunting, Twister), is a continua
tion of the first Tomb Raider movie, but this time Lara is in search of Pandoras

4 Minute Abs:
The making of the student-run comedy segment
There wont be any strenuous crunches that hurt your neck from pulling up and 
trying to lift your shoulders off the floor, nor will there be an overly-energetic, 
multi-colored-spandex-leotard-wearing instructor saying, You can do it! Just 
stake it! You wont even break a sweat from this new innovation. All you need to 
do is sit back, relax, and laugh.
Playing between Activities Board films showings in McConomy Auditorium is a 
segment called 4 Minute Abs that will soon air on cmuTV. The segment, which 
started last year as a TV project for cmuTV, is a collaboration between senior art 
major Alex Schimel, senior English and electrical and computer engineering 
double major Charlie Butcosk, senior English and philosophy double major Dana 
Vinson, senior art major Kevin Boon, and junior art major Linda Liao.
Schimel, the editor of readme, had originally thought to work on the project solo, 
and the initial title of the show was The Alex Segment. He had started to write and 
produce sketches for the show, but soon realized that it would be difficult to pro
duce it on his own. Schimel then called on Vinson, who works with him on the 
newsprint satire readme, and they discussed how they wanted to make a pro
gram that was television-friendly.
Dana and I share an interest in writing and television, said Schimel. I felt that 
she would bring a definite sense of sensibility to the project.
The entire group soon decided on the title 4 Minute Abs because it was short, 
catchy, and energetic.
When I figured out that I would have to have people working with me on this, 
he said, I felt that [the initial title] would be too self-aggrandizing.
The first show aired was a satirical commercial for Jolly Ranchers cereal and 
debuted in McConomy before an AB Film. The commercial consisted of two 
actors portraying children and another playing a father. The background music
was similar to what you might hear in the background of a Leave it to Beaver or 
Dennis the Menace show, and the children were dramatically obnoxious, yet very 
comical. As with any good cereal commercial, this one had a catchy hook line: 
Get with the program!
Each show takes three weeks to produce. In the first week, the crew works on 
writing the script, casting the parts, and deciding on shooting locations. The sec
ond week is the production period, in which the actors work on cooperating with 
each other and staging. The third week is when the shooting takes place. The 
opening scene, which shows the cast and crew of 4 Minute Abs working out to 
teeny bopper Polly Pocket-like music, is about thirty seconds long in its entirety; 
however, it took about five hours to shoot since the crew wanted the final prod
uct to be as smooth as possible.
4 Minute Abs serves as an Independent Study project for Schimel (art), Boon 
(art), and Vinson (English), while Butcosk and Liao are simply volunteering 
their time, energy, and comical vision. Their advisors include Keith Piper and 
Simone Jones of the Fine Arts Department and Sharon Dilworth of the English 
Department. They assisted the group in staying on track without exhorting their 
authority over the production process.
The newest 4 Minute Abs will be entered in this years independent film show
case, Splice: Cutting Edge Film Festival, and if accepted, will debut in 
McConomy during the festivals run, April 22 - April 27. If not, there will still be 
a showing during the last week of AB Films.
We go in McConomy, said Schimel, sit in the back row, and [listen to the] 
people laugh. Thats why we do it.
He chuckled to himself, Were desperate for attention.

Boy Genius: Where is he now?
The tale of boy who was known for his extreme intellect
Somewhere across town, in Pittsburghs Shadyside neighborhood, a once 
beautiful mind is dying. Michael (he requested that his real name not be used) 
lays sprawled out on his flannel-lined sheets, his head propped uncomfortably 
against the wall of his one bedroom apartment. Hes holding the days newspa
per, dog-eared and ragged, in one hand and a small tumbler of bourbon in the 
other.
Its not yet noon and hes been drinking for roughly two hours now.
His apartment, a soggy basement dwelling that looks out to a crumbling con
crete edifice of stairs next door, is bare of furnishings, save for a TV sitting on the 
floor and a small bookcase full of textbooks and computer magazines on the 
other side of the room. Not the quarters of a man so skilled at calculating num
bers and probabilities he was considered a natural, a boy with a knack for 
understanding complex problems and solving them with the precision of a mas
ter. Not on this day.
Today Michael is up, peering out one of three windows in his sarcophagus of 
an apartment, onto the street beyond. Outside there is movement - people 
bustling off to lunch; cars speeding down the block; nearby theres a group of 
children playing basketball - but inside his quiet quarters, Michael is the image 
of inertia. Hes stuck, it seems, in perpetual stasis.
The afternoon sunlight grabs his face now, bathing him in a soft yellow light. 
The windows have about the same luster as a neglected aquarium tank, but still 
theres enough illumination, here in this dingy room, to make out the geniuss 
ruddy complexion, his shock of black hair that strays all over his head, his round, 
smallish eyes pressed into his face like candy buttons.
Everything in the room is quiet now, all except the steady clatter from the tel
evision, whose volume is turned up far too high. Its as if the backdrop of Tide 
commercials and soap opera dramatics is there as a purposive soundtrack, to 
drown out the noise of the world. Michael sinks back from the window, bourbon 
still in hand, and looks around. He looks like a big, rumpled baby, eternally in 
disarray.
Finally, he speaks. Most days, I spend them just like this one, he says.
The common usage for the term genius was first posited in 1711 by Joseph 
Addison. In his essay, On Genius, Addison qualified the appellation as excep
tional talent or someone who had it. According to the author, there existed two 
kinds of genius, learned and natural.
The preferred type, of course, was natural; that is, the inborn ability to do cer
tain things at a trifle: create music, paint masterpieces, calculate complicated 
sets of numbers, play chess better than anyone. Individuals like Homer and 
Shakespeare occupied the natural genius category, while learned geniuses, such 
as Aristode, Francis Bacon, and Gertrude Stein, had to rely on industry and selec
tive imitation to achieve their stature.
Later on, in works like 1869s Hereditary Genius, researchers such as the 
eugenicist Francis Galton (himself a child prodigy with a 200-plus IQ) charac
terized the nature of this kind of prodigious intelligence: If genius means a 
sense of inspiration ... or of an inordinate and burning desire to accomplish any 
particular end, it is perilously near to the voices heard by the insane, to their 
delirious tendencies, or to their monomanias. It cannot in such cases be a healthy 
faculty, nor can it be desirable to perpetuate it by inheritance.
Thus, the devil in the details spelled an unkind end for many gifted children 
endowed with natural genius.
He grew up, he says, in upstate New York. Somewhere near one of its many 
mill towns, where verdant valleys give way to vineyard rows which in turn give
way to jutting, snow-stubbled mountains circled by thick pines abutting them 
like fairway rough. This is where it all started. In Oneida County, Michael had 
had an average childhood. Hunting, fishing, hiking, and long hours spent out
doors were the norm.
When he would go home, which he says he never looked forward to, he rarely 
saw his father, Roy. Roy was small and balding in those days, a delivery man 
turned plumber turned floor manager for an area cannery that was rumored to 
be closing.
According to his mother, Michaels father, believing himself to be a failure both 
to his family and himself, gradually developed a drinking habit that manifested 
sometimes in abusive ways. Roy would come home late in the evening after a 
night at one of the many taverns dotting their town in those days, his face 
charred with soot, dust, and debris from the factory floor.
With his bald head and narrow eyes he looked like a gargoyle, Michael recalls. 
Their house was small but homey, thanks to Michaels mother, a housewife who 
managed to make the best out of the spare furnishings that Roys job paid for in 
addition to the odds and ends that they occasionally came up with when visiting 
yard sales - really just another name for those trash days when folks piled up 
broken chairs, punctured mattresses, and other items outside their properties for 
the garbage man; or in this case, a station wagonload of family members des
perate for a dining room table.
Stephen Gagne, a friend of the family, recalls seeing Michael and the rest after 
one of these excursions: They were just stuffed in this [car] ... They tried to 
make enough room for all the things they had picked up by cramming into the 
front.
It was very hard for Michael in those days; he saw no future in Oneida County 
for himself. He says he dreaded ending up like his father, whom he considered a 
coward. This psychic wound would form the basis for his eventual escape. If his 
family could not help him, and he believed this to be the case, than he would 
leave by dint of his hard work.
Robert James Fischer, Bobby to the chess world and pop-culture mavens of 
the 1960s and 70s, used his prodigious ability to humiliate people. Not just 
opponents, the Boris Spasskys and the rest of the Russian masters he dueled with
 everyone.
Part of it was immaturity. He was after all the youngest chess champion of all 
time, according to the United States Chess Federation, and all that money and 
power in the hands of a handsome young man not much older than the legal 
driving age tends to corrupt.
However, Fischers malice, his detestation of the weak, runs deeper, even to 
this day.
Its his own self-loathing, really, his own feelings of inadequacy which cause 
him to lash out at enemies, corporeal or otherwise. Fischer dropped out of 
Brooklyns Erasmus High School midway through his junior year, where he was 
steadily receiving Ds in every class he took.
Though Fischer casually referred to himself as a genius ("I object to being 
called a chess genius, because I consider myself to be an all-around genius who 
just happens to play chess") feelings of self-doubt always lingered within him. He 
continually digested massive chess journals, mostly from the Russian innovators 
but also some Americans, and was adept at beautiful play the likes of which no 
one had never seen before Bobby Fischer reached the worlds stage.
However, remove him from that environment and he became peevish and 
sophomoric. He was out of place amongst the sophisticated and well-read, a set
10

---------------------------------------------------

that made up much of the chess circuit. Friends recall Fischer going out to din
ner, adjusting uncomfortably in his seat, and laying quiet while the rest of the 
table conversed.
Outside of the game, its numbers and angles, Bobby Fischer had nothing to say. 
Pulling out his miniature set, he would play quietly but conspicuously at the 
table, sealed off from the world around him. This insularity, coupled with his 
capricious mind, often sent Fischer far afield on a variety of issues, but most 
noticeably the Jews. World Jewry, it seemed, was the cause of all the worlds, but 
more importantly his, pain.
As early as 1962, in an interview for Harpers magazine, the chess master was 
reported as saying, Yeah, there are too many Jews in chess. They seem to have 
taken away the class of the game ... That's what I don't like.
In the end, Fischers venom and frothy speech lost him love. Zita Rajcsanyi, an 
eighteen-year-old Hungarian chess prodigy was the first date he had ever had in 
his life after a long letter writing courtship. Fischer had recently won the world 
championships in 1972 and was considered the best in the world at the time, 
maybe ever. When Zita, a talented player in her own right, broached the question 
of a publicized match, Fischer balked. Zita was, after all, a Jew.
The relationship fizzled out and the happy times that the two had enjoyed in 
Iceland melted away forever. Today, the inventor of Fischer Random Chess pops 
up occasionally from time to time, spouting anti-American vitriol at the country 
he is barred from returning to. Fischers story is one of ego inasmuch as it is of 
devastating intelligence.
His brilliance on the chess board was apparendy no match for this genius 
propensity towards self-destruction.
Michael can remember Fischers television exploits in the 1970s, when he kept 
crowds riveted to their seats, wondering whether Bobby would sacrifice his bish
op, or throw a fit. Michael was watching, but it wasnt empty voyeurism. He was 
admiring the young mans gift for calculation, chance, and logic. He recognized 
something similar within himself, he says, during family trips along Interstate 
90.
He can remember rows and rows offences passing at split-second clips. He can 
also remember, as a boy of no more than eight, counting them all, counting them 
and filing them away like mileposts in his collective memory. It was about this 
time when teachers began to seriously consider Michaels ability.
Though lazy, he was smarter than any other students in his middle school 
classes, then his junior high school, then high school classes. He was the best, 
and it was plainly evident that he had a gift for numbers and logical reasoning.
Michael received his acceptance letter to Stanford shordy after his father was 
murdered. He refused to comment on it, saying only that it involved a bar, a 
fight, and my father being dragged out into an alley and beaten [to death] with 
a revolver.
He said goodbye to his mother and left for California, where he was deter
mined to study mathematics, land a good job, and get rich. It was the mid-nineteen eighties and Michael was sixteen years-old. Following his fathers death, 
Michaels mother sold the house in New York and moved with his brother to 
Pittsburgh, where she would look for work as a secretary.
College life was difficult for someone barely past puberty. Michael did not fit 
in or relate to the tanned polymaths at Stanford University. He recalls spending 
long hours in the library, reading magazines or just sitting alone. He never 
received a MacArthur Fellowship, a distinction given to prodigies or genius-level 
scholars, but he was considered brilliant.
When it came to numbers and calculation, the ins and outs of the burgeoning 
personal computer phenomenon, he was an expert.
Michael was the sort of person who just has a gift, I guess you could say, said 
his friend Gagne. He can see things in numbers I know most of us cant.
During his sophomore year of study, Michael met a freshman named Sara 
Lake, a student in the mathematics department and two years his senior. The two 
hit it off well, seeing each other on and off for about a year and a half. Michael 
was smitten almost instantiy; the flaxen-haired Lake was smart, funny, and 
beautiful.
In his senior year of school, while he was interning for a software company 
close to campus, he asked Sara to marry him. Michael says Sara immediately 
blanched at the subject, accusing him of fabricating feelings between the two of 
them that were not really there. The relationship lingered on for a few more 
weeks, but eventually it crumbled and Michael was heartbroken.
He had been up until this time a teetotaler, but more and more he was turning 
to liquor to deal with his problems. Soon, and without warning, he began to slip 
into full-blown alcoholism.
There was [sic] times when I could tell it was getting worse, but I couldnt, or 
didnt, want to stop drinking, he says. The messy breakup with Sara had spilled 
over into his work and schooling, and within months Michael had dropped out 
of Stanford.
Homesick and close to penniless, Michael retuned home to his mother in 
Pittsburgh shortly after dropping out. His brother Greg puts it this way: Mike 
was in very bad shape. He was broke. He was also in and out of treatment cen
ters for his drinking.
Michael eventually setded into an apartment not far from his mothers home 
in Shadyside where he still lives today. His mother died three years ago after suc
cumbing to multiple sclerosis and since then that time his bad habits have 
returned to haunt him.
Throughout the 1990s he worked sparingly as a consultant for a few comput
er component firms, but his absenteeism and on-again off-again work ethic 
made for shaky relations with his employers.
These days he lives mainly off money from Greg and the money given to him 
by friends. He plans on looking for work in the near future outside the city, as 
the prospects for an alcoholic ex-prodigy seem to be dwindling in Pittsburgh. 
Michaels once-vibrant brain has been steadily pickled through years of alcohol 
abuse.
Its litde wonder then why every day seems the same in his soggy Shadyside 
apartment; when youve lost the ability to dream, everyday can seem like part of 
the same, ceaseless nightmare.
Michael still reads, still tests his ability to manage numbers, seeing things in 
them no one else can. Even now, in his most enervated state, he can visualize the 
odds. Hes looking out one of his three apartment windows again, towards the 
avenues colorful imagery and inimitable humanity. Its all out there for the tak
ing, says Michael.

The Future Tenant Project:
Carnegie Mellon students transform a Pittsburgh vacancy into an art exhibition
Bomb by Numbers, by Rene Garcia, also explores grids, but this time with a 
darker tone. The work consists of two maps; the first, we soon recognize, is a map 
of the city of Baghdad. A series of black dots pinpoint the Global Positioning 
System (GPS) locations of the first round of U.S bombings during the 1991 Gulf 
War. The second map has a similar grid of GPS locations, but this time on a map 
of San Francisco.
Another interesting piece is an untided work by Tawnya De La Paz. Perched atop 
a clothesline is a row of puppet owls, each representing a segment of society. At 
the center is the blue-eyed devil, an owl who represents the white man, said 
Lilith Bailey-Kroll, the shows curator. Next to him are owls representing minor
ity groups, an overweight man, and an interracial couple. The last owl has its 
wings outstretched.
This is the artist, said Bailey-Kroll, pointing to the owl, trying to lift himself up 
through his art.
What this piece has to do with San Francisco is up to the observers interpreta
tion of the piece.
The Future Tenant Project, nestled in a small, unassuming room at 801 Liberty 
Avenue, began as a collaboration between the city of Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon art students. It is the brainchild of a group of Master of Fine Arts and 
Master of Art Management students. As part of the graduate art course 60-706: 
Community Affiliation Project, the group had to draft a business plan for Future 
Tenant and was responsible for its marketing, fundraising, and publicity.
Our goal was to take a vacancy in the Pittsburgh Cultural District and transform 
it into a permanent space for exhibition and performance pieces, said Ellen 
Arnold, a public policy and management graduate student who is involved in the 
project. The name Future Tenant reflects the places ever-shifting lineup of offer
ings from local and national artists.
The projects latest exhibition, called Shifting Concrete: Navigating the Gap, 
explores how each of its artists has been inspired by the San Francisco landscape. 
Shifting Concrete showcases the work of San Francisco artists and Carnegie 
Mellon students.
pillbox. 21 April 2003.
The works in Shifting Concrete contain some of the best traits of todays art, 
such as the innovative use of space in The Angels and a willingness to address, 
and make strong statements about, current social and political issues, as in 
Bomb by Numbers. But the exhibition also suffers from the same pitfalls of 
postmodern art. Many of the works are so subjective they border on incompre
hensibility, as the level of abstraction becomes so high it leaves the observer in 
the dark. But as C.B. on the Table shows, sometimes rambling ideas, if presented 
well, are more than enough.
The exhibit will run through April 27, 2003.
HShrCn YhghwE pMnuuvSdMMhS
In the center of the Future Tenant exhibition stands The Angels, by Adam 
Davies, a tall, wooden doorway in the middle of the room. Two small screens 
adorn the inner sides of the door. On each screen, one sees a pair of eyes. The 
frame of the doorway is supported by a large network of pink wires that cover the 
floor and part of the walls, winding and criss-crossing to represent a grid of San 
Francisco.

Bomb by Numbers, hung at an angle, depicts Baghdad and San Francisco.
C.B., a lithe boy with an unreadable stare, skateboards through the streets of San 
Francisco. He stumbles off his skateboard, falls, brushes it off with a quick grin, 
and keeps on going. So absorbing are his comings and goings that we forget he 
is the fictional protagonist of the film C.B. on the Table; and that we are not in San 
Francisco.

Bulletproof Monk
Action abounds but similarities run thin
First things first: Bulletproof Monk the film has little in common with Bulletproof 
Monk the comic book. A proper review of the works would not only point out the 
differences between the film and the comic, but would also judge each piece on
- its own merits.
Similarities run thin. Both the movie and comic book share the same tide. The 
Bulletproof Monk himself appears in each of the works. The main character, 
Kar, also exists in both, but differs gready. Most importandy, the central themes 
of friendship and self-discovery pervade both the movie and the comic, helping to 
connect the two.
The comic book came first. Conceived by Michael Yanover and Mark Paniccia, 
Bulletproof Monk was an independentiy-released set of three comics. Yanover is 
the president of Flypaper Press Inc. Paniccia is the editor-in-chief.
Brett Lewis and R.A. Jones scripted the three-part tale. Editing and spiritual 
guidance were provided by Gotham Chopra. The story was then passed onto 
Michael Avon Oeming, who produced mind-bending drawings and colors. 
Oemings work was inked by Jason Baumgartner.
Despite the many hands that molded the journey of Kar, the story stays focused. 
Essentially, the tale centers around Kar, a young Tibetan man living with a distant 
relative in San Francisco. His mother sent him to the States to flee communist 
China when he was still a small child.
Kars isolation and abandonment are broken by a group of new friends who have 
connections to San Franciscos underworld. Kar gets mixed up in violence and 
crime, and kung-fu action ensues. Much time is also devoted to Kars home life 
and romantic pursuits.
~ The Bulletproof Monk appears in multiple flashbacks throughout the three issues. 
His origins can be traced back to WWII, when the Nazis invaded Tibet in the early 
40s to trace the ancestry of the Aryan race. The Bulletproof Monk then appeared, 
protecting his people and ridding the towns of Nazis.
The comic book version is free-flowing and, at times, hard to follow. But the con
tinuous themes of self-discovery and loyalty to friends never disappear. The art is 
simply incredible; Oeming used various designs and multiple perspectives to 
voice a completely unique style.
Bulletproof Monk was published in the late 90s. Recendy, Image Comics has rereleased the set of three comics with a foreword by the producer of the film, John 
Woo. The book is available at comic shops and book stores everywhere for a retail 
price of $9.95.
The film Bulletproof Monk debuted this past Wednesday, April 16. The Bulletproof 
Monk (played by Chow Yun-Fat) direcdy manifests himself in the life of Kar 
(played by Seann William Scott). Jade (played by James King) is a bad girl who 
has many surprises for both Kar and the Bulletproof Monk.
New to the story is the locale of New York City. Also new is a Nazi antagonist who 
has chased the Bulletproof Monk all the way from Tibet of the 1940s to New York 
of the 2000s. Due to new enemies and locations, the story essentially becomes a 
variation on the concept created at Flypaper Press.
Still, self-discovery and friendship ring deep in the message of the movie. Without 
both of these themes, the characters would be unable to make their journeys. The 
comic book was most likely adapted with great liberty because, in its fundamen
tal form, the story was too spontaneous and open.

Chow Yun-Fat as the Bulletproof Monk.
The film is loaded with special effects. That should be no surprise from a film 
produced by John Woo, whose other American works include Mission Impossible
II and Windtalkers. Overall, Bulletproof Monk is a movie for older teenagers who 
are interested in fantasy and action, but the movie itself manages to maintain the 
social conditions of the real world.
The comic and the film are two different bodies of work. One is an underground 
publication about a San Francisco youth; the other is a high-powered Hollywood 
blockbuster about three friends and the danger they face. Bulletproof Monk is an 
exciting tale in each medium, albeit corny and confusing at times.
Comic fans should read the Bulletproof Monk graphic novel and then accept the 
film on its own terms.
Moviegoers should see Bulletproof Monk in theaters and then pick up the comic 
to deepen the experience. Either way, self-discovery wins.

Bradford Yankiver/Photo Editor
Musical Apocalypse: Sophmore drama major Erin Joslyn (front) and senior drama major Josh 
Gad embrace in a scene from Axis of Eve. The comedy, as the director noted in the playbill, was 
no simply a satire of the war, but a remainder of how events go from bad to worst, saying that 
only when we laugh at our realities will they become clear."
