Governor Rendell speaks at Pitt
by Patrick Pettibon
Staffwriter
Pennsylvania Governor Ed 
Rendell knows he can relax when 
he speaks in front of a group of 
Democrats.
Speaking last Friday at the 
Pitt Law Democrats Meet the 
Candidates series, which fea
tured candidates who will be in
Novembers gubernatorial elec
tions, the governor took the 
microphone in hand and leaned 
against the podium like he was 
talking to an old friend.
As he spoke on the University of 
Pittsburgh campus, the governor 
focused on his plans and accom
plishments in education, health 
care, the economy, energy, reli
gious and moral values, and voter 
turnout.
In his speech, Rendell noted 
his hope to see more young 
voters going to the polls this 
November. Voters in the 18-24 
range have the lowest turnout 
rate, he said. 
Younger voters, I think, have 
the biggest stake in whats going 
on, Rendell said. If they were 
[more involved], things would be 
very different.
Rendell also spoke about his
successes in improving state 
education. Pennsylvania is one 
of seven states to show substan
tial improvement in reading and 
math scores in recent years, and 
the state now provides funding 
for pre-kindergarten education.
The governor expressed hope 
that the investments in education 
he has spearheaded will help at
tract economic investment from 
the private sector.
Matt Winterhalter, a Pitt law 
student and registered Democrat, 
disagreed with the governors 
plan.
I dont like the government 
pumping money into public 
schools, he said. Id like to see 
more competition [with private 
schools].
But the governor says his in
vestments are paying off for 
Pennsylvanians. The state now
has the highest number of jobs 
in its history. Further, unemploy
ment is the lowest it has been 
since 2001, and it is lower than 
the national unemployment rate, 
Rendell said.
Rendell gave credit to his $2.3 
billion economic stimulus plan, 
which has helped to stabilize 
manufacturing in the state.

Issues of immigration, volun
teer opportunities, and campus 
life sparked conversation 
between Carnegie Mellon Qatar 
students prepping for a busy week 
in Pittsburgh and those returning 
to the city from their service trip 
to San Diego and Tijuana.
Alternative Spring Break (ASB) 
is a program for Qatar students 
that is geared toward Pittsburgh 
community outreach. The Pitts
burgh Carnegie Mellon campus 
supports a similar program called 
Alternative Break (AB), which is a 
student organization in charge of 
community service trips abroad.
As part of Alternative Break, 15 
students traveled from Pittsburgh 
to Tijuana, Mexico, between 
March 10 and 18. The trip focused 
on border control and immigra
tion issues.
They leave their family behind 
because they cant make enough 
money where they live to support 
their family, said trip leader Kris 
Elder, a senior decision science
major, speaking of Mexican and 
South American immigrants.
Immigrants typically receive 10 
to 12 times the salary they would 
get in Mexico but are deported if 
the U.S. government finds them, 
Elder explained.
The AB group met various 
migrant workers at Casa de Migrante in Tijuana, a Mexican 
migrant shelter. There, students 
cooked dinner, sorted clothes, 
cleaned, and heard personal sto
ries from migrant workers. Elder

Pittsburgh soys #END THE
THOMAS MERTON CENTER ANTI-WAR COMMITTEE
Led by the Thomas Merton Centers anti-war committee, peace activists marched from East Liberty to Oakland on March 18. The event marked the third anniversary of the war in Iraq.

About 2000 peace activists in Pitts
burgh walked three miles from East 
Liberty to Oakland on March 18 in an 
anti-war march. The rally marked the 
third anniversary of the war in Iraq.
Under the leadership of the Thomas 
Merton Centers anti-war committee,
Pittsburghers joined 7000 anti-war pro
testers in Chicago, 1000 in Times Square, 
and thousands more across the country. 
More than 300 third-anniversary events 
were planned nationwide, according to 
a press release from the Thomas Merton 
Center.
The protesters disdain was in stark 
contrast to the careful optimism that 
President Bush displayed in his March 
19 anniversary speech. President Bush
stressed the success of American troops 
in dissolving Saddam Husseins regime 
and instituting democratic elections in 
Iraq. He' conjectured that soon Iraqis 
would be in control of more than half of 
their country, according to a March 21 
New York Times article.
Theres no excuse for invading a coun
try and killing innocent civilians, and 
theres no excuse for imposing Western 
ideas on a Middle Eastern country, said
Colby Tarnauskas, a senior biological sci
ences major and intern on the Thomas 
Merton Centers anti-war committee.
Theyre starting to call it the long 
war for a reason, Tarnauskas said.
A non-partisan disdain for the nature 
of the war itself was also evident at the 
rally.
This is a call to end the war that goes 
beyond Bush, said David Meieran of the 
Thomas Merton Centers anti-war com
mittee. It includes Democrats, Republi
cans, and troops. This is a global call to 
end the war.
Meieran believed nationwide trends 
of declining support for the war were 
reflected in the Pittsburgh area as well.
We believe that Pittsburgh is over
whelmingly against the war, he said. 
People now realize this war is wrong

I couldnt be more excited to an
nounce that The Tartan was awarded an 
Honorable Mention in the Newspaper 
of the Year competition at this years 
Associated Collegiate Press National 
College Newspaper Convention, on 
March 5. This puts The Tartan in the 
top eight weekly broadsheet newspa
pers published by any four-year college 
in the country.
I want to extend my congratulations 
to all of The Tartans staff. This staffs 
hard work and dedication have made 
The Tartan one of the best newspapers 
in its class. This is a fantastic honor that 
really shows the strides weve taken in 
the past two years. We are now more 
able than ever before to inform and 
entertain our community.
Changing gears, student government 
elections are coming quickly. In this 
election, we students choose who we 
want to represent us as student body 
president, student body vice-president, 
student vice-president for finance, and 
Senators or representatives. Important 
dates for those who wish to run for 
these positions are on the horizon:
 April 10: Final deadline for Exec
utive Office petitions
 April 14: Final deadline for Student 
Senate petitions
 April 24-25: Election Dates
The people who fill these roles can do 
great things for the student body, but 
it isnt the office that makes it possible 
for them to be effective leaders. The 
students elected to these positions gain 
very few concrete powers.
The president, for example, has 
the power to veto legislation from 
the Undergraduate Student Senate or 
the Graduate Student Assembly, cre
ate ad hoc committees, and call spe
cial meetings of the Undergraduate 
Student Senate or the Graduate 
Student Assembly. The student vicepresident for finance is granted the 
power to review the budgets of any student-government-funded organization 
activity and the power to freeze those 
budgets. These powers dont go very far 
in helping student government leaders 
get things done.
What, then, makes the positions so 
important and valuable? Its the vote. 
The greatest power these executive of
ficers can have is the support of the 
students. Thats why these elections are 
so important. A student body president 
who pulls strong student support is the 
students best chance to have a foot in 
Warner Halls door.
Thats hard to do when voter turnout 
is as low as its been in recent years. 
Only 2151 (nearly all undergraduate) 
out of more than 7710 undergradu
ate and graduate students eligible to 
vote did so last year, and only a few 
more voted the year before. Such poor 
voter turnout undermines the legiti
macy of the office. We should be aiming 
for elections that draw 50 percent of 
the entire student body. Student rep
resentatives who bring in that kind 
of participation will have much more 
weight behind them as they fight for 
students interests. This can only hap
pen if the Elections Board and the can
didates work tirelessly and creatively to 
get out the vote. Its about time we have 
a real election.
On a final note, Id like to congratulate 
Franklin Williams, a member of The 
Tartans editorial board, in being chosen 
as this years Elections Committee 
chair. I have no doubt that Franklin 
and the rest of the committee will help 
deliver a fair and successful election. 
As his role as the Electipns Committee 
chair requires his being entirely unbi
ased in the matter, Franklin will abstain 
from participating in editorial deci
sion-making related to the elections 
proceedings or the various candidates. 
I wish Franklin and the rest of the 
Elections Board the best of luck. Theyve 
got their work cut out for them.
The full results of the Newspaper of the 
Year competition are available at the 
Associated Collegiate Press website:

m06bs.html. More information about 
the elections process can be found at:

Public art forum discusses campus placement of two new sculptures
Candidates for permanent dean of Student Affairs hold forums
not being on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus.
In discussing the sculptures 
siting, audience members noted 
the limited visual space on the 
Mall and questioned the long
term plans for on-campus art. 
Robinson noted that, while the 
PAC does not explicitly have a 
long-term vision for public art on 
campus, it is certainly not [their] 
intent to turn the campus into a 
sculpture park.
Obviously, the work of the 
Public Art Committee would have 
to take each and every piece of art 
on its own merit, she said.
As Robinson provided two-dimensional diagrams of the aerial 
view of the space in a slideshow, 
attendees questioned the scale 
of the sculpture once it is placed 
on its base and requested a visual 
rendering of the sculpture in its 
proposed site.
Walking to the Sky
Closing the subject of Mao 
Yisheng, Robinson opened a 
more heated debate: the location 
of Jonathan Borofskys Walking 
to the Sky.
With a flurry of related com
ments on misc.market, Borofskys 
piece has met varied reactions 
from the campus community. 
During the week before spring 
break, flyers circulated around 
campus showing a rendering of
the sculpture and encouraging 
people to attend the forum.
Walking to the Sky is a stainless-steel pole that stands at a 
75-degree angle and includes 
seven life-size people walking up 
it toward the sky. Three more fig
ures stand at the base of the pole, 
which is 20 inches in diameter.
Alumna and trustee Jill 
Gansman Kraus has donated the 
100-foot-tall Walking to the Sky 
to Carnegie Mellon; the piece is 
to be permanently displayed on 
campus.
The original sculpture of the 
same name was temporarily on 
display at Rockefeller Center in 
New York City in the fall of 2004. 
The Nasher Sculpture Center in 
Dallas bought the piece and now 
displays it permanentiy.
According to the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, the one for Carnegie 
Mellon is currendy being pro
duced in Los Angeles.
At the forum, Robinson intro
duced the sculptures preferred 
site  on the Cut, just left of the 
tree on the south side of the side
walk near Forbes Avenue outside 
Warner Hall.
Its far back enough from the 
road to allow for the development 
of a future gateway on campus, 
Robinson said, and it was felt 
that it let people onto the campus 
as well.
Both Borofsky and the donor 
have contributed to the siting.
a great thing for this University, 
she said.
Is this item the first thing that 
shows up in every photograph [of 
campus], and is that the mani
festation of our educational and 
social and environmental agen
das? asked Vivian Loftness, a 
professor in architecture. Loft
ness, who served on the Design 
Review Committee that initially 
discussed the sculpture and pos
sible locations, expressed concern 
with placing the sculpture as an 
axial statement of campus.
I think that has been the con
cern with the [siting] on the Mall
 it takes over the imagery of the 
Mall. And I think in some respects 
thats the same problem here  
that [for the] view of campus from 
Forbes Avenue, this becomes the 
first and maybe the last statement 
in that view because it is such a 
large piece, Loftness said.
Loftness reference to the Mall 
siting regards one of the original 
plans to place the sculpture at the 
top of the Mall, between Doherty 
and Baker Halls. Last fall, digging 
began on the site for placement 
of the sculpture, and a square 
concrete base was poured in the 
ground. When University officials 
created the Public Art Commit
tee, however, they decided the 
new committee would reconsider 
the sculptures location.
See ART, page A6
The dean of Student Affairs is the 
number-one advocate for students within 
the administration, said Cole-Newkirk. 
She said she will eat with students, work 
out with them, and celebrate with them 
in order to better represent them.
Cole-Newkirk drew from her broad 
range of experience in answering the 
questions of students. Even with many 
stories to tell, she did not claim to know 
the culture of Carnegie Mellon and does 
not plan to enter the University with a 
specific agenda.
Whats important for me is coaching 
students, she said. The only way I do

Mao Yisheng
Robinson first initiated discus
sion about the placement of Mao 
Yisheng, an 8a/2-foot bronze 
sculpture of the alumnus of that 
name. Yisheng, who was from 
China, was the first person to 
graduate with a PhD from thenCarnegieTech, in 1920.
The final proposed siting for 
the sculpture is the second alcove 
of Baker Hall facing the Mall. The

If art imitates life, life just got a 
litde more controversial.
The newly formed Public Art 
Committee held an open meeting 
on Wednesday, March 8, in the 
University Centers Connan Room 
to discuss the locations of two 
new pieces of art: a bronze sculp
ture of alumnus Mao Yisheng, 
and the sculpture Walking to the 
Sky by alumnus Jonathan Borof
sky. The latter piece has drummed 
up campus debate since the fall.
Dean of the College of Fine 
Arts (CFA) and chair of the Pub
lic Art Committee (PAC) Hilary 
Robinson led the forum. Robin
son stressed that, as the PAC has 
already approved both pieces, 
the forum was merely to discuss 
where the sculptures would be in
stalled on campus.
site would, according to Robin
son, provide an historic building 
as an appropriate backdrop. 
Robinson recognized the area 
as an informal pathway5 that 
students traverse and noted the 
intent to keep it inviting for stu
dents. Two benches would flank 
the base of the sculpture, but the 
present trees standing in the al
cove would remain.
Among other considered sites 
for the sculpture were the roof of 
the Adamson Wing on the side of 
Baker Hall facing Frew Street, the 
area in front of Scaife Hall, and 
in Schenley Park. That last site 
was quickly rejected because it 
would require the citys approval,
She also emphasized the importance of 
community.
The most critical part of the job is to 
be visible and accessible and part of the 
community, she said in an interview 
before her forum. During her time in Stu
dent Affairs, Church has attended many 
events on campus. Claiming a vested 
interest in the University, Church has 
initiated new programs on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus, such as the Late Night 
Program and the Greek Task Force.
You cant build a community if you 
feel that you dont have a place where 
you belong in that community, Church 
said at her forum.
Charlene Cole-Newkirk, dean of the
College of Southern Marylands Prince 
Frederick campus, spoke with students 
on Friday, March 3. Cole-Newkirk comes 
from a judicial background but has 
worked in higher education for over 30 
years.
She has worked with students in uni
versities large and small. The campus 
over which she currently presides in 
Maryland is the fastest-growing campus 
in the state, and Cole-Newkirk has played 
a formative role in making sure that the 
needs of students are met. For instance, 
she pushed for the university to build a 
student union and made sure to voice 
student opinions when speaking with ar
chitects.
Courtesy of Nasher Sculpture Center 
This version of Walking to the Sky 
premiered in Rockefeller Center.
Other potential sites included 
the Cut, near the clock outside 
of Doherty Hall; the Hornbostel 
Mall, as depicted in renderings on 
the flyers; the Cut, near the ten
nis courts; and the area of the Cut 
behind the bus stop.
In initiating debate about 
the siting, Robinson noted the 
sculptures merits. It talks about 
ambition, it talks about reaching 
for the sky  and I think thats
forum. Church has participated in the 
application process and now stands as 
one of the three final candidates. She has 
worked in the Carnegie Mellon Student 
Affairs office for 11 years. During six of 
those years, she served as the offices as
sociate dean.
Church worked at the Yakima Val
ley Community College in the state of 
Washington as the director of Housing 
and Student Activities. Before that, she 
worked in admissions at the University 
of Iowa.
Coming into the candidate pool know
ing Carnegie Mellon and its students, 
Church shared her belief that she would 
integrate student views in her decisions.

Carnegie Mellon students have pre
pared themselves for many changes this 
semester, and the list will grow soon. The 
search for a permanent dean of Student 
Affairs is about to come to an end.
Three candidates for the position spoke 
with campus organizations, faculty, and 
students during the first two weeks of 
March. During this time, each candidate 
also held an open forum for students in 
Rangos 3 of the University Center.
On Tuesday, March 7, interim dean of 
Student Affairs Jennifer Church held her

WOMEN, from A1
for the Pennsylvania statehouse. To open 
on the forum, moderator Linda Babcock, 
a renowned economist, presented a starding statistic.
The U.S. ranks 69th in the world in 
terms of percent of female representa
tives in political office, Babcock stated. 
Germany, Rwanda, Peru, Estonia, and 
Slovakia all rank above us.
We are very interested in increasing 
the number of women in politics, said 
Heather Arnet, executive director of the 
Women and Girls Foundation of South
western Pennsylvania. We are also very 
aware that Pennsylvania ranks 47th out 
of 50 states in female political represen
tation.
The forum focused on many different 
obstacles for women interested in seek
ing political office, including the need to
be prompted to run and the lack of sup
port from political parties.
Women run when they are asked to 
run. Women want to be asked to run, 
Forouzan said. Women run when they 
think they are qualified to run. For what
ever reason, women dont often feel as 
qualified for office as men.
According to Arnet, it is hard for 
women to get party endorsement in 
Pennsylvania, especially in southwestern 
areas, where ties to labor leadership are 
strong.
Women who try to get into politics 
are often told Its not your turn or Its 
not your time, Arnet said, indicating 
that parties often give preference to men 
that they have cultivated for the political 
arena.
More specifically, Arnet mentioned 
that women who are pro-choice have 
a harder time getting Democratic
Party nominations, as the Democratic 
Party in Pennsylvania is taking a less ag
gressive stance on female reproductive 
rights.
According to Arnet, these shifts within 
the party result in women being asked to 
not run for political office by high-rank
ing officials.
She explained that democratic 
Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell asked 
pro-choice State Treasurer Barbara Hafer 
not to seek re-election so that Bob Casey, 
who is against abortion, could have the 
position.
Tonya Payne, councilwoman for the 
sixth district of Pittsburgh, also com
mented on how hard it was to gain party 
endorsement against her opponent, an 
entrenched incumbent.
At every turn when people said 
we couldnt do it, we stepped it up a 
notch, said Payne in reference to her
partys initial unwillingness to support 
her campaign.
Even for women who have no partisan 
affiliation, like panelist Deborah Grass, 
it is difficult to break into positions of 
leadership in local government. Grass, 
a policy specialist for over 300 local gov
ernments at the County Department of 
Economic Development, has worked in 
city management for 20 years. While try
ing to mentor both men and women who 
aspire to be city managers, she admits 
she is always on the lookout for talented 
young females interested in local policy 
development.
Im generally the only woman in the 
room. I dont have the same legitimacy as 
the men, Grass said.
[As a woman,] youre automatically 
suspect. You have to spend a lot of time 
proving yourself.
The forum ended with a discussion
of ways women can overcome the 
obstacles in their path to political 
representation.
The panelists nodded their agreement 
to Forouzans comment that the most im
portant thing to do as a female candidate 
is to put on your blinders and stick to 
your vision.
She noted that women are more often 
influenced by criticism, but that should 
not obscure their goal.
You just have to grow a thick skin and 
not worry about what people are saying, 
Grass added.
According to Forouzan, her goal as di
rector of Run, Baby, Run is to get so many 
women interested in running for political 
office that she works herself right out of 
ajob.
Graduate student Natalie Rudiak of 
the Heinz School of Public Policy coordi

Shabbat 1000 unites Jews and non-Jews at traditional dinner
Forum discusses lack of females in Pennsylvania politics
SHABBAT, from Al
alike for a traditional Shabbat 
dinner.
The Jewish Shabbat, or Sab
bath, is an observance that stems 
from the Bible; it commemorates 
the day of rest taken by God 
on the seventh day of Creation 
and lasts from sundown Friday 
through Saturday evening. Many 
traditional Jewish families gather 
each Friday evening for a festive 
dinner.
For Jews, this event will help 
them become more connected 
with their Jewish heritage, 
stated electrical and computer 
engineering and math senior 
David Levitt via e-mail. Levitt, 
a member of the student board 
of the Chabad House on campus 
and Tartans for Israel, noted that 
the event is a unique experience 
for non-Jews to learn about Jew
ish culture.
Shabbat 1000 gives people 
from all walks of life the chance 
to sit down together for a meal, 
he said. What could be a bet
ter step towards building unity 
between many different organi
zations than a nice dinner?
Eric West, a senior in mechani
cal engineering and robotics,
acknowledged this solidarity.
The organizers have done an 
excellent job of making the event 
accessible to all sects of Judaism 
and non-Jews alike, he said.
There were optional oppor
tunities for prayer and washing 
of hands, catering to each 
individuals level of observance.
This event has really exposed 
me to the diversity present within 
Judaism, said electrical and 
computer engineering senior 
Alana Frome. I am glad I had the 
opportunity to share this experi
ence with my Jewish friends.
West estimated 30 percent of 
the crowd to be non-Jewish.
The first speaker welcomed all 
comers to the event with the aid 
of children flashing signs reading 
cheer, sing, and quiet. A re
sponsive crowd actively listened 
and participated in the opening 
address.
Rabbi Shmuel Weinstein of 
Chabad House also spoke. He 
likened Shabbat 1000 to the com
munity that gathered at the base 
of Mount Sinai to receive the Ten 
Commandments over 3000 years 
ago  people gathered in fellow
ship as one body.
Pittsburgh Mayor Bob 
OConnor then roused the crowd. 
He praised the event as a testa
ment to the strength of the Pitts
burgh Jewish community and 
the Pittsburgh community as a 
whole.
The energy he built in the room 
reached its zenith as he shed his 
blazer, revealing a yellow T-shirt 
adorned with Shabbat 1000: 
March 24, 2006 on the front and 
Be a part of if on the back.
With the aid of the cheer and 
sing signs, the evening then 
transitioned to song with the 
singing of Shalom Aleichem, a 
song meant to request blessings 
of peace and happiness.
A rabbi then took the stage 
and, after quieting the crowd, 
blessed the food. A crowd ready 
to eat chanted eat, eat, and 
began the meal, which included 
the traditional foods of challah 
(yeast-leavened bread), gefilte 
fish, chicken, and noodle kugel.
The evening concluded with 
the Birkat haMazon, or blessings 
after the meal.
According to Levitt, the caterer 
estimated that 750 people were 
served at the event. While the 
event didnt reach the goal of 
1000, West saw it as a success 
in terms of numbers and overall 
message. In Shabbat tradition, 
this event has truly embraced 
community.
Approximately 750 people participated in Pittsburghs first Shabbat 1000 last Friday evening in the Soldiers & 
Sailors Memorial ballroom. Chabad House organized the event to bring together Jews and non-Jews.

Three final candidates for dean#of Student Affairs hold forums
DEAN, from A3
that is to establish relationships.
Richard Ferraro, who held his 
forum on Wednesday, March 8, 
currently serves as the dean of 
students at Bucknell University. 
He has worked at Emory Univer
sity, William and Mary College, 
and Columbia University. Like 
Cole-Newkirk, his experience ex
tends from the large university to 
the small college.
Ferraro believes that his job 
is not just your widgets and 
numbers  he likes to connect 
with his students on more than 
a superficial level. At Bucknell, 
he has visited hospitalized stu
dents and has participated in 
events to which students invited 
him.
Like Cole-Newkirk, Ferraro 
intends to get a better picture of 
Carnegie Mellon before putting 
forward any agenda.
. It is the height of fatuousness 
to assume that you can come in 
and immediately decide to do 
this and that, he said.
Ferraro emphasized holistic 
learning that involves more than 
the intellectual. A first-generation 
college student in his family, he 
believes that the primacy of edu
cation should apply to all things 
curricular and meta-curricular.
Ferraros anecdotes evinced 
his firm belief that dialogue re
quires civility. I think a dean of 
students needs to be above fac
tions, he said.
The selection process began
when former Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy took the 
position of associate vice-president last April. Associate Dean of 
Student Affairs Jennifer Church 
took his position last fall and be
came the campus interim dean. 
She will remain the interim dean 
until the administration hires a 
permanent one.
Last fall, an 18-person commit
tee took charge of the search for a 
new dean. Richard Tucker, head 
of the Department of Modern 
Languages, led the committees 
efforts.
The committee is broadly 
representative of the students 
and faculty, said Tucker. 
Representatives from all seven 
of the Universitys colleges came 
together to find Murphys succes
sor.
Dean Murphy set good prec
edents. He was accessible and 
communicated well with faculty 
and students, Tucker said. He 
worked tirelessly, and his succes
sor must be of the same caliber.
Beginning in the second week 
of last November, the committee 
developed a position description 
and sent out notices of the job 
to sources such as The Chronicle 
of Higher Education. They met to 
discuss the qualities of an excel
lent candidate and brainstormed 
the qualities desired in a perma
nent dean.
About 70 applicants submitted 
complete packets for the commit
tee to consider. Each committee 
member ranked all of the packets
on a three-point scale: A score of
1 indicated an extremely strong 
candidate that the committee 
could see in the position.
After compiling descriptive 
statistics about the ratings of 
each candidate, the committee 
chose nine to interview over the 
telephone. Four or five members 
of the committee participated in 
each individual telephone inter
view.
The committee members 
then ranked each candidate on 
the three-point scale again and 
discussed which candidates to 
recommend. In the end, they 
suggested that three of the candi
dates be brought to campus.
I believe that the committee 
approved these three candidates 
enthusiastically  almost unani
mously, in fact, Tucker said. We 
wanted to see the person in real
ity versus the person on paper 
and on the telephone.
The three candidates who 
made it this far met with 
many campus organizations 
within the last two weeks 
and faced more questions and 
review. Tucker hopes the small 
window of opportunity to see the 
behavior of the candidates will 
pay off*
From here, the search commit
tee will further deliberate on the 
candidates based on feedback 
from the campus community. 
Tlicker noted that the goal is 
to have a new dean of Student 
Affairs before the end of the 
semester.

The Thomas Merton Center 
announced that this years 
protest had a special focus on 
military recruitment, echoing the 
burgeoning counter-recruitment 
movement in Pittsburgh and 
around the country, according 
to the groups press release.
Kleissler said that college 
students have been particularly 
helpful on recruitment issues be
cause it is a concern directly af
fecting their generation.
College students have a lot of 
energy and a lot of time and pas
sion, he said. They bring a fresh 
perspective of their generation 
that is extremely valuable.
Dan Papasian, a senior in po
litical science and policy and 
management, stated that he 
and several other Carnegie Mel
lon students worked with the 
Thomas Merton Center and other 
activist groups to help organize 
the event.
College Democrats president 
Jonathan Mendelson, a senior in 
social and decision sciences and 
public policy and management, 
stated that the group was not in
volved in the protest but has been 
an active contributor to projects 
of the Thomas Merton Center in 
the past.
Still, Tarnauskas maintains 
that political apathy abounds 
on the Carnegie Mellon campus, 
in an area where there are so 
many chances to get politically 
involved.
Were a really critical 
generation, she said. Were a 
powerful demographic. We are 
all smart here at CMU and we 
should use that.
RALLY, from Al
and they need to express their 
disapproval, and Congressional 
reps for this area are against the 
war.
Jim Kleissler, director of the 
Thomas Merton Center, added 
that the city was sympathetic to 
protesters.
A lot of people are realiz
ing that they can change their 
m'inds, Tarnauskas said.
Kleissler described the protest 
as a good peaceful march with 
a good turnout.
However, he felt that police 
presence during the march was 
domineering. [The police] over
reacted to the protest in terms 
of their preparations, he said. 
It would be good for them and 
the cityto not look so heavyhanded.
Meieran added that it was 
disconcerting that the police sur
veillance was as large as it was, 
calling it completely unneces
sary. He reported a display of
60 heavily-armed riot troops at 
the Oakland recruiting station, 
the marchs final destination.
Pittsburgh police denied the 
accusation.
From our standpoint, we were 
adequately prepared based on 
the size and scope of the event, 
said Tammy Ewin, a Pittsburgh 
police spokesperson. We are re
sponsible for ensuring the safety 
of the protesters, businesses, resi
dents, and officers.
She stressed that there was no 
surveillance of protesters by the 
Pittsburgh police.
Carnegie Mellon Campus Po
lice lieutenant John Race added 
that the police had predicted a 
turnout of 5000 people, which 
is why preparations may have 
looked excessive.
[The police] were well-prepared, not over-prepared, he 
said. We will never take negative 
action unless it interferes with the 
safety of [Carnegie Mellon]. 
Both police forces mentioned 
their effort to not interfere with 
the protesters First Amendment 
rights. We didnt impede on any
ones right to free speech, Ewin 
said.
Race agreed. I sympathize 
with their right to protest  peo
ple have a right to speak out. I 
wouldnt want [the police] tell
ing me what to say all the time, 
he said. Our function is to make 
sure they dont get hurt express
ing their political views.
There was one arrest made at 
the recruiting station.
Otherwise, Ewin reported that 
no one was hurt and property 
damages were minimal. The 
Thomas Merton Center is pretty 
mild, Race said. He reported 
that many protesters thanked him 
for the police preparations to en
sure their safety. One protester 
stopped and shook my hand, he 
said.
Among protest participants 
were high school students, local 
college students, protesters from 
outside the region, and represen
tatives from other activist groups 
in the area, including Code Pink, 
Pittsburgh Organizing Group, 
Black Voices for Peace, and sev
eral anti-recruitment groups.

Governor Rendell 
speaks at Pitt
A rendering of the Cut shows where alumnus Jonathan Borofskys Walking to the Sky is to be installed before commencement.
Governor Ed Rendell spoke at the University of Pittsburgh last Friday in 
a speech that outlined his plans for the November election.
GOVERNOR, from Al
Investing in alternative sources 
of energy, he said, will also help 
boost the economy. Research 
in clean coal gasification will 
reduce the amount of coal waste 
and produce an energy source 
within the state.
Pennsylvania currently spends 
about $30 billion each year to 
import energy.
Governor Rendell recognized 
the importance of religious and 
moral values to his campaign and 
to his party. The governor hopes 
voters will focus less on issues 
such as gay marriage and more 
on the basic shared principles 
of Christianity, Islam, and 
Judaism. He claimed the 
Democratic Party has led efforts 
to feed the hungry, heal the 
sick, [and] house the homeless. 
Rendell also outlined his plans
for health care. One of his goals 
is a plan called Cover All Kids, 
which will provide full medi
cal care for all of Pennsylvanias 
children by 2009. If successful, 
Pennsylvania will be the first 
state to do this.
Samantha Grenell-Zaidman, 
a senior voice major, asked the 
governor how he plans to pro
tect the womans right to choose 
to have an abortion. Rendell 
stuttered a little in his response, 
saying he would wait to see what 
the courts would do about the 
issue.
Having never heard Rendell 
speak before Friday, GrenellZaidman said she was happy 
with the governors plans for 
the state and for the Democratic 
Party.
Love thy neighbor, she said in 
response to the governors moral 
platform. I think its true.
Forum debates location of Walking to the Sky
ately following the forum to dis
cuss the siting while the debate 
was, according to Robinson, very 
fresh in our minds.
From that discussion, the 
committee has made recom
mendations to president Jared 
Cohon for siting on both pieces 
 the Baker Hall alcove for Mao 
Yisheng, and the area of the Cut 
near Forbes Avenue for Walking 
to the Sky.
I think it was very clear that 
people  no matter what they 
felt about the piece coming or 
not coming or whether they like 
it or not  they felt the site we 
recommend was much preferable 
[to] the site that was originally 
recommended on the Mall, Rob
inson said in a telephone inter
view following the forum.
Pending the presidents 
approval, the proposed sites 
will go forward to Facilities 
Management Services for final 
approval.
University officials created the 
PAC at the end of February as a 
result of Public Art Policy guide
lines being put in place. Over
the last couple of months, the 
guidelines went through review 
and passed into University policy 
early this semester. The policy 
stipulated the formation of the 
committee with the dean of CFA 
as the chair.
Other committee members in
clude the head of the School of 
Art, the director of the Regina 
Gouger Miller art gallery, the 
associate vice-provost for Campus 
Design & Facility Development, 
the director in the office of the 
president, and the vice-president 
of advancement. The committee 
also includes two each of trustees, 
faculty, and students  two un
dergraduate and two graduate.
The policy also stipulates a 
public forum for feedback on all 
future public art.
We have to listen to repre
sentation from all sources  its 
important, Robinson said.
Robinson was very pleased 
to see so many people  
approximately 175, according 
to a March 15 article in the 
Post-Gazette  at the inaugural 
forum.
ART, from A3
I do think the arts are not as 
visible on this campus as they 
ought to be, given their centrality 
to the history of the Univer
sity, said Judy Cole, director of 
Alumni Relations. Personally 
I love the piece, and I love the 
site.
Dan Boyarski, head of the 
design school, agreed. I think 
[with] anything like this, once 
youve gotten used to it, youll 
pass by it, he said.
Boyarski encouraged the 
sculpture as a chance to advance 
rather than to be stuck in the 
time of Henry Hornbostel, the 
campuss original architect.
This is our campus, this is our 
art, these are our buildings, this 
is our landscape. Lets move for
ward, he said.
Other members of the School of 
Art cited a lack of both public and 
contemporary art and noted the 
defining presence of public art on 
such campuses as Princeton, Har
vard, and the University of San
Some campus members were 
not so sure.
I think the art part of the cam
pus is getting in the face of people 
who dont have an appreciation 
for art, said Mark Adamson, an 
alumnus and Computing Services 
staff member. Theyre putting it 
right out in front of campus, and 
theyre saying This is the campus. 
Theres more than artists on cam
pus. I dont think CFA would like 
it if we put a 16-foot model of an 
IBM 360 in the front of campus.
Gordon Lewis, a Heinz School 
professor and chair of the Faculty 
Affairs Council, agreed.
To me, it defines us as a lead
ing university that doesnt believe 
in physics, he said. Where it 
is, I immediately feel that it de
fines us in the wrong way, he 
said.
According to Robinson, the 
committees aim is to have the 
piece installed by commence
ment.

The purpose of that was just 
to spend time with the workers, 
Elder said.
Sophomore chemical engi
neering major Chad Pugh further 
explained the spontaneous act. 
Fun isnt a part of their everyday 
lives.
Migrant workers focus primar
ily on making money for their 
families, he said.
The group heard the sym
pathetic viewpoints of various 
organizations, said junior busi
ness major Jeremy Astor. In par
ticular, Pedro Martinez of the 
American Friends Service Com
mittee talked about the need for 
an improved Mexican economy 
rather than the building of more 
fences.
The committee also provided a 
tour of the border.
But its also important to get 
the anti-migrant side of the story, 
both Elder and Astor noted.
We aU talked about doing our 
research.... Thats really impor
tant for any issue, Astor said. 
A conference call with the Minutemen  a grassroots border 
control effort  is in the works, 
Elder said.
The benefit of our trip wasnt 
immediate, Pugh said. We reaUy 
brought a lot back with us that we 
can pass on to other people.
Because migrant workers 
are important economic assets, 
border regulations should be 
loosened, he said. The more peo
ple who are aware of such issues, 
the greater the chance that some
thing positive will happen.
It really makes you think 
about the things you vote for,
Astor said. He suggested inform
ing other people of immigration 
issues through dialogue and con
tacting state representatives.

Maher explained.
Its fun and inspiration for me 
to do community service work, 
Iqbal said.
In Qatar, people tend to equate 
community service with philan
thropy, explained Gilmore. She 
pointed out that Qatar is a wealthy 
community. Youre talking about 
a society where you dont see povChad Pugh
erty, she said.
Philanthropy has religious 
roots as well. Iqbal explained 
that Zakat is an Islamic way of 
giving a percentage of money to 
charity. Essentially, if people are 
rich and can spare money, they 
do  people just dont want to 
take time to perform community 
service, Iqbal said.
Theres this discomfort among 
families to experience the harsh
ness and tough aspects of seeing 
people that are needier than
you, Maher said, viewing the 
philanthropic tendencies in terms 
of culture and society.
If Im paying the money, its 
the same as being involved, 
Maher added, paraphrasing the 
general attitude.
Maher hopes to return to Qa
tar having grown but also having 
experienced those who arent so 
fortunate. Having seen poverty 
in her home country of Egypt, 
Maher described what its like to 
live in a society where poverty is 
evident.
If you can give that pound to 
someone to eat, then you do it, 
Maher said.
For Iqbal, community service 
provides satisfaction. Theres 
something that you get out of 
these things that you cant ex
press in words, he said.
Gilmore hopes that students 
like Iqbal and Maher share their 
experiences with others in Qatar 
and work to form a core group 
geared toward community ser
vice.
This group of students can 
help cultivate that aspect of life in

Science & Techonology Editor
IBM researchers have built 
the first elementary computing 
circuit around a single carbon 
nanotube molecule, a material 
that holds great promise and 
may one day replace traditional 
silicon. The work pushes the fea
sibility of using individual mole
cules to build future generations 
of sophisticated microelectronic 
devices to new heights.
The researchers believe that 
the new technique will aid in 
simplifying the semiconductor 
manufacturing process, as well as 
provide a foundation to test the 
logic gate conductor in several 
electronics applications, includ
ing PC processors.
IBMs work is a milestone 
because the type of circuit the 
researchers built  called a ring 
oscillator  acts like a speed
ometer to evaluate the electrias the electroencephalogram 
(EEG). The next step, control
ling devices with thought, could 
prove especially beneficial for 
people who have lost one or 
more of their limbs. People who 
have lost motor control due to 
some spinal injury would benefit 
immensely from mind-controlled 
prosthetic limbs. A device known 
as the BrainGate System is mak
ing such applications possible.
Currendy there are several 
tests being carried out in this 
field across the globe. Cyberki
netics Neurotechnology Systems 
is running clinical trials that have 
resulted in a quadriplegic pacal current flowing through the 
nanotube. Circuit speeds were a 
million times faster than previ
ously demonstrated experimentient operating a prosthetic limb, 
changing television channels, 
and interacting with a computer.
In the BrainGate System, a sen
sor is implanted on the surface 
of the patients primary motor 
cortex, the part of the brain 
responsible for movement. The 
sensor is extremely thin and is 
embedded about a millimeter 
into the brain. It picks up electri
cal impulses that pass between 
neurons (brain cells) when the 
patient thinks. BrainGate is used 
by the patient to move the cursor 
on a computer screen, for exam
ple, using thoughts alone.
In order to demonstrate the 
underlying principle and appli
cations of the BrainGate System, 
the patient is asked to perform 
cursor-moving tasks about twice 
a week. This activity is also used 
to evaluate the quality, type, and 
usefulness of the response that is 
generated by the patient while 
using the BrainGate System.
BrainGate has several 
advantages over other thoughtcontrolled devices. As John Donoghue, director of Brown Universi
tys Brain Science Program and 
a co-founder of Cyberkinetics 
Neurotechnology Systems, Inc., 
said in an interview with LiveScience.com, BrainGate pro
vides an interface with a com
puter that works immediately, 
without weeks or months of train
ing... [The BrainGate] connects 
directly to the part of the brain
tal circuits.
At the moment, the circuit 
is slower than currently avail
able silicon chips. However, rethat ordinarily controls hand 
movement and gestures, and 
it provides significantly more 
utility than devices that rely on 
substitutes for the brains own 
arm movement signal, such as 
eye movements. Using eye move
ments, for example, to control 
a computer prevents one from 
looking elsewhere during use  
something that is very unnatural 
and cumbersome.
In this way, cursor control with 
BrainGate has become as conve
nient as using ones own hand. It
searchers believe new nanofab
rication processes may reveal the 
performance potential of carbon 
nanotube electronics.
We are exploring moving 
beyond silicon-based chips to 
significantly boost the perfor
mance of PCs, said IBM research 
staff member Joerg Appenzeller 
in a Sci-Tech Today press release. 
Silicon chips will continue to im
prove, but we need to look ahead 
decades into the future.
Carbon nanotubes are well 
suited for electronic processors 
because there is no resistance 
to electric current, significantly 
increasing the speed at which 
currents are switched on and off.
Researchers are now focus
ing on constructing carbon 
nanotube transistors and 
recent breakthroughs at IBM 
demonstrate the potential of car
bon nanotubes in nanochip fabri
cations.

a conversation while practicing 
cursor control with his or her 
thoughts. The future holds im
mense promise for the BrainGate 
System. It could be a stepping 
stone to giving people with spinal 
injuries some sense of control. 
Not only that, it could also be the 
first step towards devising neuroprosthetic limbs that could be en
tirely controlled by brain activity. 
Technological advances of this 
kind are giving hope of a better 
life to people with disabilities.

unique electron current proper

more current than present silicon

Grapefruit juice can 
interfere with drugs
Grapefruit juice, once just a 
tangier alternative to orange 
juice, has dubious properties. 
While testing the effects of 
alcohol on blood pressure drugs, 
researchers were amazed to find 
that drugs administered along 
with grapefruit juice increased 
drug potency to dangerous levels. 
Grapefruit juice interferes with a 
family of enzymes that processes 
drugs and toxins to make them 
less potent. Further testing found 
that similarly acidic fruits, like 
limes and oranges, also block 
those enzymes.

Tiny helicopter uses 
new method to fly
A Norwegian engineer has 
created a tiny helicopter that 
utilizes a novel method of keep

Picoflyer has two stacked rotors 
encompassed by rings. The 
rotors counter-rotate to offset 
the opposing spin forces from the 
engine and fuselage. The rings 
keep both rotors in the same 
plane, creating a passive-stability 
system to maintain the balance 
of the Picoflyer should it tip. Mili

The shifty* liar is no 
longer an accurate
A study recently published 
in the Journal of Nonverbal 
Behavior showed that liars, con
trary to popular belief, twitch 
and fidget less than people who 
are not lying. The gestures we 
associate with lying, such as 
touching the nose or playing with 
hair, are self-adapting gestures, 
meant to provide comfort when 
we are upset. However, liars are 
acutely aware of their bodies and 
will refrain from making gestures 
that give them away. In fact, liars 
are more likely to make grand, af
firming gestures to support what 
they are saying.

How Things Work: Contact Lenses
Kathy Chiapaikeo
Many people find that wear
ing eyeglasses is a hassle, espe
cially when they need them for 
various activities. How is it that 
a pair of eyeglasses can have the 
same effect on blurry vision as a 
pair of thin contact lenses? And 
in addition to wearing contacts 
to correct vision, some people 
wear contacts to change the 
color of their eyes.
The first contact lenses were 
water-filled glass tubes attached 
to tiny lenses  not the most 
comfortable things to wear at 
all. They covered the entire eye
ball and were so heavy that they 
could only be worn for a few 
hours.
Contact lenses give wearers a 
more natural field of vision be
cause they move with the eyes 
and are able to correct the re
fractive error closer to the eye. 
The lenses stick to a layer of tear 
fluid on the surface of the eye. 
They are also held in place by 
eyelid pressure and by blinking, 
which lubricates the cornea and 
flushes away any debris that ac
cumulates on the lenses.
In normal vision, light rays 
enter the eye through the cor
nea and become focused on 
the Retina at a central point in 
the back of the eye called the 
focal point. Nearsightedness 
and farsightedness result from 
light not being focused directly 
on the retina. The shape of the
eye is very important in keeping 
what we see in focus. Depending 
on what type of vision problem 
a person has, the shape of the 
contact lense helps refocus light 
on the retina. Contact lenses 
work in much the same way as 
eyeglasses.
People with nearsightedness 
can see things clearly close up, 
but cant see things far away. 
Nearsightedness is the result 
of the eyeball being too long, 
causing light rays to focus in 
front of the retina instead of on 
it. The contact lenses needed 
to correct nearsightedness 
are concave: Theyre thinner at
the center than at the edges. This 
helps to spread the light through
out the lenses and focuses light 
back onto the focal point of the 
retina.
Meanwhile, people with far
sightedness can see clearly far 
away, but have trouble see
ing things up close. It is the 
result of the eyeball being too 
short, which causes light to 
focus behind the retina. The 
contact lenses needed to cor
rect farsightedness are convex. 
Theyre thicker at the center, 
which bends the light toward 
to center and moves the focal 
point, which is behind the retCourtesy of lasikeyecenter.tripod.com
ina, to the retina.
To correct astigmatism, a spe
cial type of lens called a toric 
lens is required. Astigmatism oc
curs when the cornea is irregu
larly shaped, which causes light 
to focus at several points. These 
lenses are made specifically for 
each individual to correct the 
different angled curvatures. 
The lenses must be put in the 
eyes in a specific way. They usu
ally have more weight on the 
bottom or have a thinner top and 
bottom edge to keep them fixed 
in one position on the eye.
Color contact lenses not only 
correct vision, but they also
enhance or change eye color. 
Eye color is determined by how 
much melanin, a dark brown 
pigment, is at the surface of the 
iris.
Opaque lenses have solid color 
applied to the surface of the lens 
in a variety of shapes and pat
terns that resembles the natural 
look of the eye. When worn, the 
solid colors cover the natural 
color of your eyes. Your natural 
eye color, showing through the 
clear spaces, blends with the 
color being reflected from the 
solid colors.
Tinted lenses work well on 
light-colored eyes, but not on 
dark-colored eyes. Light reflects 
off the lens and passes through 
the lens. The light-colored eyes 
iris absorbs some of the light 
and reflects the lighter color. In 
dark eyes, the light that passes 
through the lens is absorbed and 
a darker color is reflected back.
The strength of the lens, ex
pressed in diopters, depends on 
how much it bends light. The 
higher the diopter, the stronger 
the lens.
Contact lenses are similar 
to glasses, but more care must 
be taken with contacts. Prob
lems with contact lenses can 
include discomfort, itchiness, 
or redness  possibly due to a 
lack of oxygen-carrying tears. 
Even though these thin trans
parent plastic discs are fragile, 
they work wonders with blurry 
vision!

Mandatory ignorance harms students
Five months ago, the press leapt on 
the Kansas State Board of Education 
when Bobby Henderson took a stand 
against its latest flip-flop in the intel
ligent design versus evolution debate. In 
order to respect the boundaries between 
church and state, the intelligent design 
curriculum opened itself to all opposing 
views; before long, Henderson created 
the Church of the Flying Spaghetti 
Monster. Hilarity ensued.
Now, for their latest trick: Since sex 
is so offensive to so many, particularly 
when it enters American classrooms, 
the board has adopted a policy requir
ing written parental consent before 
students can take sex education classes. 
Previously, the order was reversed; those 
with moral or religious objections could 
opt out of sex ed given parental consent. 
The scary part is, this isnt even a new 
idea; according to the Associated Press, 
Arizona, Nevada, and Utah all have simi
lar opt-in policies.
The chairman of the Kansas Board 
of Education says that its goal is to em
power parents. In fact, it only deprives 
students of the information they need 
and deserve.
Far be it from us to dictate what is 
appropriate behavior  especially 
regarding the touchy subject of sex. 
However,, evidence points to a sharp 
decrease in teenage pregnancy when stu
dents have all of the information taught 
in a typical sex ed course. Obviously, 
obstacles to enlightened sex ed are the 
complete opposite of what we need.
And teenagers whose parents want to 
shield them from the truth are the ones 
that need this information most. Theyre 
the ones who stand to suffer from man
datory ignorance.
To make matters worse, the board is 
now considering tightening the rules 
even further to require programs that, 
instead of educating students about sex, 
pound nothing but the message ab
stinence until marriage into students 
heads. The proposed bill would limit 
funding for any district that fails to put 
into effect the preferred programs, many 
of which aim to scare kids with facts 
that are far from truth. Shaming, scare 
tactics, and misinformation are not edu
cation.
For instance, according to the cur
ricula of some of these federally funded
programs, one out of every seven times 
a couple has intercourse with a con
dom, a pregnancy will result; condoms 
prevent the spread of HIV less than twothirds of the time; and merely touching 
another persons genitals can result in 
pregnancy.
Interestingly, the Kansas state legis
lature is pushing an opposite stance; it 
recently passed a bill requiring almost 
the exact opposite treatment, mandating 
that all students receive full information 
about sex education with discussion of 
abstinence as an option.
The state of Kansas  and those who 
set its educational guidelines  should 
step back and realize why sex education 
exists in the first place. These classes 
dont create a new society of moral devi
ants, and they dont dissolve religion. 
Sex education has been proven to ben
efit the community and the individual, 
both physically and psychologically.
Instead of trying to empower parents, 
the state should consider using educa
tion to empower students to make their 
own healthful decisions. Education about 
sexuality, pregnancy, and STIs doesnt 
encourage sex. Making sex taboo does.
Art forum squandered by bias and bickering
Oscar Wilde once said, No great art
ist ever sees things as they really are. If 
he did he would cease to be an artist. 
So when it comes to placing art on cam
pus, its clear that the universitys Public 
Art Committee (PAC) artists need a few 
other pairs of eyes to help them be objec
tive.
But obviously the PAC  or* at least 
March 8s public art forum moderator 
Hilary Robinson  isnt interested in 
understanding campus discussion over 
its art. Toward the end of the forum, 
which was riddled with squabbling dissention over the impending placement 
of Jonathan Borofskys Walking to the 
Sky sculpture, Robinson got a chorus 
of nos when she asked the audience if 
they approved of its new site in front of 
Warner Hall.
Somehow, though, she missed that 
glaring fact: In a later interview with 
The Tartan, Robinson claimed she had 
the audiences support in sending the 
PACs site proposals to President Cohon.
How Robinson could have possibly 
construed this consensus from the forum 
(wherein one professor even passed out 
copies of a typed rant on why the sculp
ture couldnt fit on campus) is beyond 
us. It evidences, though, the two key
problems of how this situation has been 
handled. First,-the University doesnt see 
fit to give its students a say in whether 
pieces like the Borofsky sculpture are 
placed on campus. Second, consider
ing the increasing campus grumblings 
against it, students have yet to create a 
coherent argument for their cause.
Chaired by Robinson, the PAC was 
recently created to review proposals for 
permanent installments of art on cam
pus. The PAC is part of the Public Art 
Policy, a plan to formalize the selection 
of art, a process that used to be informal. 
That new policy allows public forums to 
debate the location of artwork the PAC 
approves.
Robinson had to constantly remind 
the audience of the forums purpose
 to debate the location of the art, not 
its integrity. After all, the two sculptures 
have already been approved and will 
be placed on campus regardless of the 
forums outcome.
Jonathan Borofskys Walking to the 
Sky is obtrusive, one participant said, 
and will surely become a visitors first 
lasting impression of the university. It 
would be akin to going to a job interview 
dressed as a chicken, he said. But the dis
cussion began to spiral downward when
a second attendee responded in shock 
that people dont know art cant hurt 
you.
Meanwhile, were shocked that both 
dissenters and supporters of the sculp
ture thought this type of discourse 
would help.
The discussion then degenerated 
into a debate between those who 
claimed they represented the scientifi
cally minded camp of Carnegie Mellon
 which doesnt feel the art represents 
the university  and the campus artists 
who retorted with the elitist motto, You 
just dont get it.
Then, like children arguing over 
whom their parents love more, the two 
groups used art to bicker over their pres
ence on campus. The university doesnt 
appreciate art, according to members of 
CFA; but according to more scientific 
minds, CFA is using public art to impose 
itself on the rest of campus.
An open forum to discuss the immi
nent installation of two sculptures is 
neither the time nor the place to engage 
in an inter-college skirmish. If campus 
members want their voices heard, they 
need to recognize the proper context for 
doing so and take advantage of the op
portunities they have for expression.

Two suggestions for much-needed reform
Benjamin Hackett
The window for any real tax reform 
is closing fast. In a general public policy 
sense, the actions of leaders in a re
public should reflect the sentiments of 
the electorate. Change is only possible 
when a majority of the country desires 
it. As such, it is only reasonable to ex
pect leadership to push for the positive 
reform of a system that a majority of 
the electorate uses.
As it stands now, the numbers show 
that a shrinking majority of Ameri
cans are actually paying taxes. The tax 
system is inching dangerously close to 
becoming fully funded by a minority of 
the population. The top 50 percent of 
wage earners pay 96.54 percent of all 
income taxes.
So what do you say? Let the rich top 
50 percent pay the taxes, right? Based 
on 2003 Internal Revenue Service 
data, the top 50 percent of wage earn
ers included all individuals and jointly 
filing couples earning $29,019 or more.
These are not the people that are ___
stereotypically associated with 
the word rich. However, when 
politicians talk about how only 
the rich get tax breaks, these par
ticular taxpayers are included in 
those sentiments.
Soon, a minority of the nations 
population will be shouldering 
the entirety of the income tax 
burden. This is a big problem. A 
setup where the majority does 
not pay for entitlement programs 
(Medicare, Medicaid, Social Se
curity), if left unchecked, will 
bankrupt the country and not aid 
in reducing and reforming said 
programs. The costs of the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan pale in 
comparison to the funding that 
goes towards these backwards,
broken, and hole-ridden social ------
safety nets.
Politicians and lobbyists complain 
that the tax cuts do not give enough 
money back to this countrys poor. 
Some people will balk at this next state
ment, but it is empirically sound. There 
is no way to cut taxes on the lowerincome 50 percent of this country when 
the lower 50 percent do not pay any 
income taxes!
The danger here is seen in the current 
leadership. Traditionally, overspending 
and entitlement program growth have 
been liberal problems, but now it is 
spreading to certain Republican lead
ership. These alleged Republicans have 
violated their conservative beliefs in fa
vor of incumbent pork barrel spending.
Yet this is not about spending prob
lems; this is about the impossibility 
of tax reform when a minority of the 
country foots the entire bill.
The policy arena is currently debat
ing two significant reform concepts 
that could solve this problem. These 
soutions are known as the fair tax and 
the flat tax.
The fair tax is a consumption-based 
tax. This taxation is not conscripted
 that is, consumers choose to pay 
taxes by the goods they consume. This 
tax also promotes savings and invest
ment. The fair tax requires that other 
tax elements be repealed prior to its 
enactment.
The site www.fairtax.org states 
three basic requirements for establish
ment of the fair tax. First, the passage 
of legislation that repeals the income 
tax, the payroll tax in its entirety, the 
estate tax, the gift tax, the capital gains 
tax, the alternative minimum tax, the 
self-employment tax, and the corpo
rate tax. Next, the passage of laws 
that install a single-rate, national sales 
tax on all new goods and services at the 
point of final purchase for consump
tion, and that provides for a universal
Politicians and lobby
ists complain that the 
tax cuts do not give 
enough money back to 
this countrys poor.... 
There is no way to cut 
taxes on the lowerincome 50 percent of 
this country when the 
lower 50 percent do not 
pay any income taxes!
rebate in an amount equal to the sales 
tax on essential goods and services up 
to poverty-level spending. And finally, 
the last element is the adoption of a 
constitutional amendment to repeal 
the 16th Amendment and to prohibit 
income taxes.
The flat tax is another simplified 
taxation system. Steve Forbes pro
posed this plan, calling for deep tax 
cuts across the board. The plan calls for 
not one cent [given] to the IRS on the 
first $36,000 of income. Anything more 
than that would be taxed at a flat, fair
17 percent.

Perspectives
Soon, a new 
deliberative 
poll on rights
_____
Tom Sabram
Sometimes the best ideas and 
relationships are discovered ac
cidentally. I would like to report 
that I think I have found one 
such relationship for student 
government.
Through the involvement 
of Student Senate and the stu
dent body president with the 
suggested amendments to the 
Students Rights Policy, the peo
ple at Campus Conversations 
would like to host a deliberative 
poll on students rights.
Not only have I been in con
tact with them, but Michael 
Bueti, the chair of the Academic 
Affairs committee, has also 
been providing background in
formation for the development 
of the document used to teach 
about this movement on cam
pus. This document has been a 
work in progress for most of the 
semester; it does a spectacular 
job explaining the national and 
campus movements for stu
dents rights.
When I vetoed the Students 
Rights Resolution, I questioned 
the input from constituents on 
their thoughts on the need for 
the proposed changes; delibera
tive polling would allow student 
government to gather data to 
make decisions that accurately 
reflect the feelings of the stu
dent body.
Im not suggesting that such 
polls should always be used, 
but for major initiatives, more 
data would be beneficial to the 
cause.
This will be the second de
liberative poll to occur on cam
pus. After talking about the first 
poll, I learned that participation 
was lower than desired. Thus, 
the poll will now be held on a 
weekday night, instead of on 
a Saturday morning. Also, in
stead of just randomly e-mailing students and asking for their 
participation, we will put up 
posters and send requests for 
student organizations to send a 
few representatives to the event, 
which should help to increase 
turnout and provide a statisti
cally significant set of results.
I hope that this poll will have 
a high turnout and be a useful 
tool to student government. I 
would like to see this partner
ship grow into a fruitful one 
that helps form a more repre
sentative relationship between 
student government and the 
student body.
The poll will occur on Wednes
day, April 12, in the evening. If 
you are interested in participat
ing, please send me an e-mail. If 
the results are gathered and an
alyzed prior to my final article, 
I will report the findings to you 
toward the end of April.
Tom (sbp@) is excited about the 
new opportunity for the student 
body president to work with 
Campus Conversations to accu
rately gauge campus opinions.
With the debate raging over public art projects on campus, we wanted to know what students would like to see added to campus. We asked: A PERSONS OPINION

cutting taxes leads to higher

__________________Jackie Brook
On a campus that boasts the 
odds are good, but the goods are 
odd, the need for gender studies 
seems to become more apparent 
with each passing day.
Despite deliberate efforts 
by Admissions to enroll more 
women, Carnegie Mellon still 
maintains a healthy  or not so 
healthy3:2 men-to-women ra
tio. With what seems to be stag
nant growth in the female popu
lation on campus, the Office of 
the Dean of Student Affairs has 
continued to develop its Womens 
Leadership Program (WLP) to 
stimulate thinking about what 
it means to lead as a woman in 
all contexts.
While the Womens Leadership 
Program seems like a wonderful 
idea, offering workshops in The 
Meaning of Gender, Gender 
and Leadership, Womens Is
sues in History, and the like, 
the way in which the programs 
participants are chosen is only 
the first in a list of concerns sur
rounding the program. Women 
on campus must first be nomi
nated by a member of the faculty 
or staff (or a colleague, though 
there have not been communica
tions to students on campus as to 
how they can nominate someone 
for the program). Then they are
required to fill out an applica
tion. If chosen, they are permit
ted to attend five workshops 
throughout the semester pro
moting women as leaders.
With issues as important as 
gender studies and womens 
empowerment on the line, why 
are students excluded from the 
program? Female students who 
arent nominated do not have 
the chance to attend any of the 
beneficial workshops, and men 
are not even eligible. Given the 
limited size and the intended in
timate nature of the workshops, 
shouldnt all students on cam
pus, male and female, be given 
the chance to learn something 
about gender and leadership?
To some it may seem obvious: 
A womens leadership program 
should only be for women. But 
teaching women to be leaders is 
simply not enough. Our society, 
as a whole, could benefit from 
teaching men to respect women 
as leaders. How can the Uni
versity offer workshops that 
examine the role of gender in 
leadership positions and exclude 
60 percent of the undergradu
ate population without even so 
much as a blink?
The program seems to be work
ing towards filling a hole in the 
schools curriculum by providing 
some of its students with a brief 
introduction to gender studies. 
But what about the men? Why 
have no efforts been made to in
troduce gender studies to some, 
if not all, men on campus?
Well, efforts were made. 
An e-mail was sent out to a few 
male students, asking if theyd 
be interested in participating 
in a Mens Gender Study Pro
gram. That seemed to be as far 
as the program went. Perhaps 
the mens program never took 
off because there was a lack of 
response and support from the 
male community. Perhaps the 
program never took off because 
there were organizational prob
lems. Whatever the case may 
be, there are no avenues on this 
campus for men to participate in 
gender studies, and that is repre
hensible at a school of Carnegie 
Mellons caliber.
Regardless of the flaws in the 
WLPs participant selection pro
cess, a tremendous amount of 
good can be done by encourag
ing women to become strong and 
talented leaders. Perhaps one 
of the women participating in 
this years program will eventu
ally lead her own gender studies 
workshops that include both 
genders.

South Dakotas governor parrots abortion opponents tired, hypocritical rhetoric in defense of a new bill
f y Marshall Roy
In America, life is sacred.
Sort of.
On March 6, South Dakotas Republican 
governor, Michael Rounds, signed the 
nations most restrictive abortion ban 
into law. He and his legislature are taking 
President Bushs new Supreme Court for 
a test drive, aiming to challenge the 1973 
Roe v. Wade decision and precipitate the 
nationwide criminalization of abortion.
The South Dakota law, if held up, would 
make it a felony to perform an abortion 
unless the mothers life is in danger. There 
are absolutely no exceptions for rape or in
cest. Mississippi and Missouri have already 
jumped on the bandwagon, forming a 
confederacy of dunces considering similar 
legislation.
Governor Rounds exercised some highfaluting and hypocritical rhetoric defending 
the ban. In the history of the world, the 
true test of a civilization is how well people 
treat the most vulnerable and most help
less in their society, he said.
Like all anti-abortion rhetoric, thats a 
lovely sentiment. Unfortunately, cursory 
research reveals that South Dakota is 
hardly a poster child for the defense of its 
tired, poor, and huddled masses. Eighteen 
thousand of the states children have no 
health insurance. Two-thirds of its fourthgraders perform below grade level in math 
and reading. More than 27,000 children 
live in poverty in South Dakota, and the 
state is home to all three of the nations 
worst counties for child poverty.
I bet thats not on their commemorative 
quarter.
If Governor Rounds is so committed to 
easing the plight of societys most vulner
able and most helpless, where is his soap 
box on these issues? Cruelly, his inflated
rhetoric only highlights his states lam
entable record with its citizens who have 
actually been born.
Rounds flawed reasoning continues: 
He invoked Brown v. Board of Education 
to prove that judicial activism is positive, 
and that Roe v. Wade could  and should 
 be overturned. This argument is way 
too simple-minded.
The truth is, both the best and the worst 
decisions in Supreme Court history have 
been made by activist judges. Arguments 
over the inherent wisdom of judicial ac
tivism or restraint are useless, because 
there will always be cases to prove either 
opinion.
Sure, the verdict in Brown v. Board of 
Education was courageous and just. But 
consider the 1857 Bred Scott v. Sandford 
case, another paradigmatic example of 
judicial activism. It ruled that no one of 
African descent could be an American 
citizen and that slavery was permissible 
everywhere -+- not just in southern states. 
The case helped trigger the Civil War. 
We can accept, a century and a half later, 
that some of our nations hoi polloi were 
ignorant. But that our governments best 
thinkers would conclude that one man 
could own another  that is a historical 
blemish even more embarrassing than the 
institution of slavery itself.
Of course, the problem isnt only South 
Dakota. Shoddy anti-abortion rhetoric has 
been rubbing me the wrong way for a very 
long time. Anti-abortion activists love to 
wax high and mighty, spewing that life is 
sacred. I dont buy it. Call me cynical, but 
Ive taken a long, hard look at this country 
and I just dont buy it.
Consider that 40 percent of American 
children live in a household with a gun, 
and that 42 million Americans under age 
65 have no health insurance. Consider 
that our nation cant cough up the Kevlar 
for our soldiers on foreign soil or that 
were titillated by torture on prime time 
television.

Consider that were one of only two 
industrialized nations to have a death pen
alty (the other is Japan, with two or three 
executions per year, compared to over a 
hundred for us).
It seems to me that in America, life is 
sacred the way marriage is sacred: in ide
ology, in fantasy, in the space between the 
teleprompter and our presidents empty 
stare.
If life isnt really that sacred in this coun
try, then whats all the hullabaloo over 
abortion? The conspiracy theorist in me 
wonders if this isnt jyst a machination of 
the religious right, as it tirelessly attempts
Danielle Saudlno/Dossier Literary Editor
to force its way into our personal lives. The 
pessimist in me wonders how much the 
American hoi polloi has learned since the 
days of slavery.
In the centuries since our crude clus
ter of colonies became united states, 
our nation has done a lot to protect our 
revered liberty. We once went to war with 
ourselves in the name of freedom. So make 
no mistake: If we are not free within our 
own bodies, then we are not free.

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
tennis team competed in the 
Fab Five Tournament hosted at 
Washington & Lee University 
this past weekend.
Entering the tournament with 
a record of 10-3 and ranked 12th 
in the nation, the Tartan women 
tasted some of the countrys 
highest competition. They 
embraced the challenge and held 
their own.
The Tartans encountered 
stiff competition on day one 
against third-ranked Amherst 
College. Despite possessing the 
lower rank, the Carnegie Mellon 
women pried away a single 
win from Amherst when third 
doubles Alison Liu and Kelly 
Nakamura came out on top with 
an 8-5 win.
Unfortunately, this would be 
the only win for the Tartans, as 
Amherst finished the day with 
eight wins. The Tartans did not 
give up without a fight, however, 
as second singles Mona Iyer and 
fourth singles Liu managed to 
force their matches to three sets.
Unfazed by the loss, the
Tartan women came back strong 
with a 5-4 win over 25th-ranked 
University of Mary Washington 
on day two, advancing to a 1-1 
record.
The women started the day 
strong as they secured two early 
doubles wins. First doubles Amy* 
Staloch and Sheena David won 
their match with a dominating 
8-2 performance, and third 
doubles Liu and Nakamura 
added to the doubles victory 
with a solid 8-5 win.
The day ended victoriously 
as the Tartan women secured 
the first, third, and sixth singles 
wins, clinching their match. 
Third singles David overcame a 
grueling tiebreaker to secure the 
deciding match that put Carnegie 
Mellon over Mary Washington 
5-4.
After the invigorating win 
over Mary Washington, the 
Tartans were not able to carry 
the momentum going into day 
three, as the team fell to the 
eighth-ranked Williams College 
3-5 on Sunday.
Third doubles Liu and 
Nakamura would once again 
prove victorious with a win for 
CMU. They were undefeated 
throughout the entire weekend,
a difficult feat given the tough 
opposition the tournament threw 
at the Tartans.
The weather fluctuated 
throughout the entire weekend, 
and Carnegie Mellons final 
match with Pomona-Pitzer was 
cancelled due to rain.
The Tartans finished the 
tournament ranked 14th 
nationally, but the win over 
Mary Washington solidified the 
Tartans regional ranking in 
fourth place  putting them on 
pace to qualify for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
tournament in May.
We showed we can hold 
our own with those guys in the 
competition. The women have 
played very hard, and its been 
an honor to be invited to the Fab 
Five Tournament, commented 
head coach Andy Girard after the 
three-day tournament.
Im very proud of the women; 
they have done very well and 
shown that they can compete 
at a national level. We should 
be in very good shape for our 
upcoming matches and the UAA 
Championships.
The Carnegie Mellon women 
are back in action tomorrow at 
the University of Pittsburgh.
H&C assessment underway of Carnegie 
Mellons athletic and fitness facilities
FACILITIES, from A16
the facilities made no lasting 
impression and did not invite 
entry. The facilities also have 
small lobbies, no social space, 
minimal natural day lighting, 
and no flow or circulation due 
to the facilities being separated. 
Our facilities also lack a place 
to display past trophies and 
athletic accomplishments of 
our programs. When asked of 
his impression, Kocher replied 
that, given our stature, he was
surprised by your facilities from 
an athletic standpoint.
Much is still up in the air in 
this part of the planning process, 
such as a location, a timetable, 
and the funding needed. 
Possible locations include, and 
are not limited to, renovations 
to Skibo, the intramural field, 
the Morewood parking lot, the 
tennis courts, or the Cut, with 
the latter two locations possibly 
being underground.
H&C, which has completed 
projects at such schools as
Rhodes College, Chatham 
College, Marietta College, and 
Georgia Tech, will be returning 
to campus in early April, and 
is hoping to be able to present 
Carnegie Mellon with a final 
report by next September.

new athletic facilities, fill out

March is 
dedicated to 
basketball
MADNESS, from A16
Then, UCLA scored the last 
11 points to win 73-71 against 
Gonzaga. Gonzagas Adam 
Morrison epitomized the agony 
of defeat as he just lay face-down 
motionless at center court. 
Connecticut pulled a win out 
of thin air Friday when they 
stunned Washington. UConn 
arguably has the most talent 
in the country, but they al
most dug their own grave with 
their turnovers. Then Rashad 
Anderson came to the rescue 
with a three-pointer to tie it 
with one second left.
So many memories are made 
amid the madness that is March. 
Without it, life would be so 
bland. There are two great things 
about March. First, its not over 
yet, as there are still more games 
to be played and a champion to 
be crowned. Second, March will 
cycle through and occur again 
next year at around this time, 
meaning the whole process will 
start over again. Another season 
will sadly end when the cham
pionship is played next Monday, 
but dont fret. Major League 
Baseballs opening day is this 
Sunday.

love about baseball...

Carnegie Mellons first game 
was against Rockville, a team 
anchored by years of experience 
and players from the Puerto 
Rican and Dutch national teams. 
The Tartans were defeated by 
Rockville, 14-3. Carnegie 
Mellons bad luck continued with
a loss to the Virginia Tech A team, 
17-6, and to the University of 
North Carolina, 11-6. The next 
day, the Tartans finally pulled 
out a win against the Virginia

Mens lacrosse beats 17th-ranked Indiana University of Pennsylvania
Junior midfielder Chris Broglie drives to the net as Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) defender Mike Edge tries to protect his goalie. The 
Tartans beat IUP 10-9 on Thursday night at Gesling Stadium. The lacrosse teams second home game paralleled their first, with freezing play
ing conditions and a victorious outcome, but in this game the Tartans play was much more cohesive and aggressive. The Tartans next home 
game is Wednesday against Grove City at 7:30 pm.
Club Sports Roundup

Sports Editor
Baseball
The Carnegie Mellon baseball 
team played a doubleheader this 
Saturday against Penn State and 
fell short to the Nittany Lions 
11-0 in the first game and 6-0 in 
the second game.
First-year pitcher Jon Coens 
immediately got into a jam in the 
first inning of game one. A walk, 
a single, and another walk loaded 
the bases with no one out. Coens 
battled back, however, striking 
out the next batter and inducing 
a ground ball to the shortstop. 
The Tartans could not turn over 
the double play, and a run was 
scored. Before the inning was 
over, three more runs would cross 
the plate, putting the Tartans in 
an early 4-0 hole. Coens allowed 
one run over the next three in
nings, keeping the team in the 
game. But the Tartan bats never 
got going, and two errors in the 
fifth allowed six more runs to 
cross home plate, giving Penn 
State a mercy-rule-shortened
11-0 victory.
Senior Pete Sukits was the start
ing pitcher in game wo. In the 
second inning, Penn State scored 
two runs on four straight hits. 
Sukits allowed two more runs in 
the third inning before leaving 
the game with numbness in his 
pitching hand. Sophomore Sandy 
Williams came in to relieve and 
allowed only two unearned runs 
in the next four- innings. Penn 
State pitcher Ryan Frankeny al
lowed only two hits and led the 
Lions to a 6-0 victory over the 
Tartans.
The baseball team lost several 
players from the fall team but 
was able to recruit heavily during 
the off-season and replaced lost 
pitching. With only one graduat
ing senior, the-team looks to be 
strong for years to come.
Mens Lacrosse
The mens lacrosse team was 
busy this week with games 
on Wednesday, Saturday, and 
Sunday This weeks play put the 
Tartans at 3-2 for the season and 
2-2 in league play.
The Tartans opened with a win
on Wednesday night with a 10-9 
victory over 17th-ranked Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania (IUP). 
The Tartans started strong and 
had a 6-2 advantage by the end 
of the first quarter. Sophomore 
Matt Adams and senior Alex 
Knecht scored all six of the teams 
goals in the period. However, IUP 
would tie the game at the half. 
The Tartans responded by netting 
three straight goals and regaining 
a 9-6 lead, but an IUP surge tied 
the game. The Tartans offense 
was unable to put any shots past 
IUPs goalie, Ben Levine, who 
would turn away 20 shots on the 
game.
With less than two minutes to 
play, the Tartans took control as 
Knecht found the back of the net 
for the third time all night on a 
tough second-chance shot. After 
controlling the ensuing face-off, 
the team held strong and ran 
down the clock to secure a onepoint victory. Also scoring for the 
Tartans were juniors Tomo Gibson 
and Rick McMullen. Senior goalie 
Pete Lafave had 16 saves for the 
night.
'The Tartans were not as lucky 
this weekend in their games
against Dayton and Eastern 
Michigan. They fell to Dayton 
15-9 on Saturday and to Eastern 
Michigan 11-8 on Sunday.
Womens Softball
Womens softball had to cancel 
its first two games of the sea
son. The first, scheduled for last 
Thursday, against La Roche, was 
canceled due to weather. The 
second, scheduled for yesterday 
against Penn State Fayette, was 
canceled due to a lack of play
ers. The softball team looks to 
finally get their season underway 
with a doubleheader against the 
Community College of Allegheny 
County on Saturday

March: A month for 
madness and mayhem
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
There is no better name for 
college basketball at this point 
of the year than March Madness. 
Something unnoticeable to 
the human eye occurs when 
February ends and March be
gins, opening the floodgates to a 
whole month of buzzer beaters, 
fantastic finishes, and unlikely 
heroes. Anything can, and usu
ally does, happen in March.
This year, March wasted no 
time generating a buzz as topranked Duke, 27-1 at the time, 
fell to the unranked Florida State 
Seminoles in Tallahassee.
When the week of confer
ence tournaments commenced, 
Syracuse went from a team 
on the bubble to winning four 
straight games, becoming Big 
East conference champions and 
receiving the automatic bid. 
Gerry McNamara, Syracuses 
overrated guard (dont say 
that in front of his coach) proved 
his critics wrong during that 
four-game stretch with his heartstopping, season-saving per
formances against Cincinnati, 
Connecticut, and Georgetown.
There was Monmouth, too. 
Little Monmouth created may
hem in West Long Beach, N.J., 
when they upset Fairleigh 
Dickinson to win the Northeast 
Conference Tournament and 
earn themselves an automatic 
berth in the Big Dance.
Selection Sunday rolled 
around and the bracket was 
released. The Missouri Valley 
Conference got four teams in, 
and it could have been five, ex
cept Missouri State was axed. 
Cincinnati and Michigan also 
had their bubbles burst, but 
their losses turned into some
one elses gain as Utah State, 
Air Force, and George Mason 
earned bids. George Masons 
inclusion drew some confused 
looks and criticism, but lo and 
behold, maybe the selection 
committee members do know 
what theyre doing.
Sunday to Thursday was a 
tough period, but fortunately we 
could get our fix of basketball 
with NIT (not-in-tournament) 
games being played. Everybody 
filled out a bracket during this 
time; some, like me, treated it 
as a deeply religious experience, 
with many hours spent research
ing and meditating, while others 
just went off of which teams 
mascot would win in a fight. 
Sadly, the latter usually works 
better than the former, as weve 
got Tigers and Bruins but no 
Lions (oh my!).
On Thursday, Wichita State 
and Seton Hall tipped off at 
12:20 pm, and Day One play 
continued for the next 12 hours.
A hot Boston College team 
needed double overtime to beat 
Pacific, reinforcing the whole 
idea that anything can, and 
usually does, happen in March. 
Chris Lofton sank an incred
ible shot from the right corner 
to let Tennessee squeeze past 
#15 seed Winthrop 63-61, and 
in whats becoming an annual 
thing, a #12 seed knocked off a 
#5 seed with Montana winning 
over Nevada.
On to Day Two, when 
Jermaine Wallace made a shot 
that he will never forget. Down 
63-61 against #3 seed Iowa, 
Northwestern State had the 
ball. They came down, missed, 
Wallace picked up the long re
bound and from the left corner 
(and with a hand in his face) 
hit nothing but net to give the 
Demons a 64-63 win. Watching 
replays of that shot sends chills 
down my spine. History re
peated itself as Syracuse and 
Kansas lost in the first round for 
the second straight year.
Louisiana State (Bradys 
Bunch and Big Baby Glen 
Davis) made it to the Final Four 
with their victory over Texas in 
OT, but lets backtrack to their 
second-round game when, down 
by two, LSUs Darrel Mitchell 
drilled a three with 3.9 seconds 
left. Its amazing how a shot like 
that goes on to change the whole 
course of not only a game, but a 
tournament.
UCLA also hung on by the skin 
of their teeth in their second 
round game against Alabama,
. eventually winning by three.
In what was possibly the most 
dramatic day of the tourna
ment, March 23 saw Duke, West 
Virgina, and Gonzaga lose heartbreakers. J.J. Redick ended his 
career in horrible fashion, go
ing 3-18 from the field, and yet 
Duke still almost defeated LSU. 
Later, WVU and Texas squared 
off in a good old-fashioned barn 
burner. WVU, behind tattooclad Kevin Pittsnogle, played 
catch-up before Pittsnogle hit a 
dramatic three to tie the game 
at 71.
WVUs celebration was short
lived  along the lines of five 
seconds in fact, as Texas came 
straight down and sank a three 
of their own as the buzzer 
sounded. Texas was very close to 
being Pittsnogled, which I read 
is an actual verb, meaning to 
be victimized by a hot-shooting 
West Virginia big man. Instead, 
WVU got Paulinoed.

Plans for new athletic 
facilities set in motion
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
Are Carnegie Mellons athletic 
facilities lcirge enough? Are they 
cohesive enough? Does Carnegie 
Mellon need an indoor track, 
indoor tennis courts, or more 
seating for spectators of athletic 
events? Do Gesling Stadium, 
Skibo Gymnasium, and the 
athletic facilities within the 
University Center leave you with 
an impression of grandeur or of 
squalor? These are the types 
of questions the executives of 
Hastings & Chivetta Architects, 
Inc. asked Carnegie Mellon 
students and staff in an attempt 
to help assess the outdoor and 
indoor recreation and fitness 
facilities at Carnegie Mellon.
Hastings & Chivetta (H&C) 
is a company of architects, 
planners, and interior designers 
that provide a full range 
of architectural services to 
institutional, educational, 
municipal, and corporate 
clients. Currently, H&C is 
helping Carnegie Mellon 
develop a master plan and a 
future direction for athletics, 
health, and wellness, which 
could involve constructing a 
brand new athletic and fitness 
center on campus within the
0
next five to seven years.
H&C was at Carnegie Mellon 
all last week meeting with focus 
groups. They gave presentations 
on the process and components 
of designing and building a new 
facility. At the same time, H&C 
gathered first-hand information 
from students and staff. H&Cs 
visit was capped off*by a town 
meeting open to the Carnegie 
Mellon community, held last 
Thursday.
Principal-in-charge Chris 
Chivetta and design principal 
Erik Kocher went into detail 
in their presentations on 
everything that needs to be 
considered throughout the 
process, of building a new 
facility. There are site-design 
and planning issues ranging 
from embracing Carnegie 
Mellons master plan to creating 
excitement, awareness, and 
participation in athletics. The 
new facility could include a 
lobby and control desk, a 200- 
meter indoor track, indoor 
tennis courts, classrooms, and a 
climbing wall.
Chivetta and Kocher talked 
about the impressions they 
had of the Universitys athletic 
and fitness facilities, with 
both commenting on how

College/Major;
Chemical engineering
by Corey Tucker
Junior Staffwriter
Senior golfer A.J. Straub was 
recently named as the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) golf 
athlete of the week.
This honor is a response 
to Straubs performance in 
Carnegie Mellons season-open
ing play in St. Petersburg, Fla., 
over spring break. Straub led the 
Tartans with a score of 74 over
i
18 holes. His score was enough 
to help the Tartans to a firstplace finish in the three-team 
field. The Tartan recently talked 
to Straub to find out more about 
him and his role on the Carnegie 
Mellon golf team.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing golf, and why did you 
start?
Straub: My dad taught me 
how to play when I was three. I 
got one of those plastic sets with 
the wiffle balls and would hit 
them around the yard all day. 
When I was five he cut down 
some real irons for me.
T: Did you always want to 
play collegiate golf?
S: No, I actually came to 
Carnegie Mellon to play bas
ketball. After freshman year, I 
talked to the golf coach and he 
said to come out for the team.
T: What is the hardest part 
about being a student athlete at 
Carnegie Mellon?
S: Time management. I play 
golf and basketball, so I am 
never out of season because golf 
is a spring and a fall sport and 
basketball is a winter sport.
Its tough to find the time to 
practice your athletics and to get 
your studies done at a university 
|. -
of this caliber.
T: What is the best part?
S: Ive got to see a lot of places 
for free all over the United States 
that I have never been to before 
because of the travels of athlet
ics. You get to play on so many 
great golf courses that you nor
mally wouldnt have access to 
for free.
T: Do you have any supersti
tions or good luck charms?
S: I only play Titleist Pro Vs 
with the number 2 on them in 
tournaments.
T: How do you gain your com
petitive edge? What do you do 
before your rounds?
S: I listen to Bon Jovis Living 
on a Prayer before every golf 
match and basketball game.
T: What is your most mean
ingful golf accomplishment and

Intensity equals success
Coldplay leads way for indie rockersDid you know?
I wish I could start my article on Coldplay by 
talking about how much I know about music, 
and how Coldplay is a generic rock band that 
has somehow made it big through good looks 
and major-label support. But as Coldplays 
"Swallowed in the Sea" eases its way through 
my fluffy headphones, I slowly come to the 
realization that I cant trash them. I smile wide 
as I catch myself trying to find something wrong 
with the track. Unfortunately for me, I cant 
find anything wrong. In three minutes and 59 
seconds, I hear excellent group chemistry, decent 
technical skills, catchy songwriting, and, most 
importantly, musical intensity.
This final skill is exactly what makes Coldplay 
so dam good and contagious. Sure, singer Chris 
Martin may accent his Ss and Ts a little too 
hard, bassist Guy Berryman may lose time every 
now and then, and guitarist Johnny Buckland 
might buzz on the guitar, but dammit, they are 
simply cooking with musical intensity.
So what is it that makes Coldplay one of the 
biggest bands in the world? What is it about 
Coldplays records that sells? How are they able 
to pack basketball arenas and festivals around 
the world? Sure, being on a major label and 
getting music videos and radio play all help, 
but how did they get there? There has to be 
something more than distribution advantages 
that make them so universally acclaimed.
I found my answers at the Coldplay concert at 
Clevelands Quicken Loans Arena last Monday 
night. After months and months of touring on 
the same set list, you'd think the band would be 
dead out of energy, and this would be another 
stop on the road. Then add on the boredom of a 
Monday-night gig in Cleveland. But somehow 
the band came out, and put every drop of 
energy they had into the performance. It felt like 
Coldplays farewell performance: that night, there 
would be nothing left to give to music.
At the beginning of Talk," Chris Martin slams 
his piano fervently as his shiny white sneakers 
twitch with delight. By the end of the number, he 
is leaning so far back in his chair that his head is 
nearly touching the ground, his feet flailing in the 
air. Simply phenomenal drummer Will Champion 
eloquently bangs the crap out of his drums 
during Fix You." With syncopated strokes on the 
tightly tuned snare drum and flurries of cymbal, 
he is the epitome of graceful intensity that the 
group has mastered.
Within this graceful intensity and caipe 
diem approach to music lies the answer to 
my questions. Each Coldplay song, each 
performance, makes you feel like it is their last. 
The music is dripping with energy and passion. 
Sound cheesy? Simply put, most people listen 
to music that is played with intensity. In this
Courtesy of hotandcoldplay.com
respect, Coldplay is simply perfect: They have 
musical and emotional intensity. Coldplay 
sounds like no one else. Coldplays use of both 
pianos and synthesizers gives them a unique 
mix between classic rock, blues, and new wave 
electronic music. Martins smooth voice adds 
a pop twist to the equation, while Champions 
drumming maintains the elegance of jazz 
drumming and the energetic intensity of a rock 
musician. The resulting product of these factors 
make Coldplay a treat to listen to.
It is this blend that Coldplay have concocted that 
frequently weeds out the talented musicians from 
the ones who only last for their 15 minutes of 
fame. While jazz musicians are often too focused 
on fast licks and scales and hard rockers are often 
too fixed on playing loudly, Coldplay is on their 
way to finding the right balance between wellcrafted songs, satisfactory musical technique, 
and energetic delivery. And as Coldplay 
continues to grow, they continue to set higher 
and higher standards for up-and-coming groups. 
In fact, the most important group of musicians 
to pick up from Coldplays style is actually the 
indie rockers. Although they lack the talented 
production team and state-of-the-art technology 
to which Coldplay have access, groups like The 
Arcade Fire and The Fiery Furnaces are being 
recognized as creative in their compositions, 
above-average in their technical prowess, and, 
above all, passionate in their performances. Like 
Coldplay, these and other indie rock groups 
perform fabulous live shows because of their 
energy. They are engaging visual performers and 
energetic musicians.
Although I can often be a music snob, I have no 
shame in supporting Coldplay. Coldplay are as 
big as they are for a good reason. They are good 
players, passionate musicians, and, yeah, theyre 
hot. Now we just need Chris Martin to become 
Man of the Year, and well be all set.

A Tartan columnist wrote about the benefits of 
learning to live in an imperfect world, and to take 
the motto you cant always get what you want

might expect: for students to take a good hard

sacrifice. My suggestion for what you should give 
up for Lent? Organized religion. Or... Lent.

Maybe you started to lose faith In reality television when 
Joe Millionaire's Evan and Zora called it quits. You might 
have jumped ship as soon as Ruben Studdard beat Clay 
Aiken in the second season of American Idol. Perhaps you 
hung in there until Stephen chose Kristin over LC on Laguna 
Beach. Or maybe you never left at all. If youre still a sucker 
for competitive redecorating, plastic surgery, and hidden 
cameras, then you wont want to miss the latest gimmick in 
reality television: trading races.
In FXs Black. White., two families alter their appearances 
and speech patterns to observe racism in America as never 
before. Throughout the series, the six participants  white 
Bruno, Carmen, and Rose and black Brian, Renee, and Nick
 share a house in Tarzana, Califormia. During the day, they 
don their costumes and at night they regroup to discuss their 
experiences. For example, 41-year-old Brian noted that he was 
treated differently as a white man at a local country club. For 
the first time in his life, a shoe salesman physically placed a 
shoe on his foot instead of just leaving it in the box.
Black. White, is similar to a 1959 experiment conducted 
by John Howard Griffin, who darkened his skin to explore 
Southern discrimination firsthand. Griffin wrote Black Like Me
 a widely read book in the 60s  about his experiences, 
such as receiving watchful stares from a white bus clerk and 
being prohibited from leaving a bus at a rest stop while white 
passengers were allowed pff.
But did Black Like Me really need a small screen revival? It 
isnt 1959 anymore, and the racism of today often takes on 
a much more subtle form. Bruno  47 years old and white
 expected to hear racial slurs as he walked down the street 
dressed as a black man. In an article for the Detroit Free Press, 
television critic Mike Duffy noted that when Bruno did not 
suffer such overt racism, he ignored the more discrete forms 
of intolerance and assumed that he was not suffering from any 
racism at all.
In fact, most of the drama on Black. White, comes from its six 
central characters rather than race. Washington Post reporter 
Chip Crews wrote, Certainly there are tensions, but those 
seem to belong to another reality show altogether  you 
could put any two unacquainted families in the same house 
and, regardless of color, there probably would be a touch of 
strife. Unsurprising for reality TV, Brian and Bruno appear 
cast specifically to get on each others nerves. If the creators 
of Black. White, were expecting to document the same 
racism that Griffin saw in 1959, they didn't find it. Perhaps 
compensating via scripted internal conflict is a strong 
indicator that in America, racism is not as palpable as it once 
was.
Black. White, might be out of step with the real world, but 
if the Academy Awards are any indicator, its right in line 
with the rest of the entertainment industry. When Crash won 
this years best picture award, it showed that the Academy 
voters still go for portrayals of overt racism in America, 
however dated they may be. As it turns out, Crash and Black. 
White, have a lot in common. Crash, like Black. White., is 
disproportionately focused on explicit racism. In an article on' 
the film, MSNBC's Erik Lundegaard wrote, What is the big 
problem with race in the Los Angeles of Crash? That everyone 
enunciates every racial thought they have." Lundegaard 
points to unrealistic scenes from the film, such as when 
Sandra Bullocks character makes derogatory comments to her 
husband about their Latino locksmith while he can hear her.
Instead of celebrating a movie that depicts mostly obsolete 
forms of racism, it might have been better for the Academy 
to give attention to a more timely civil rights issue: that of 
homosexuality. Films concerning race and ethnicity have 
been honored in the past, such as Schindler's List, In the Heat 
of the Night, and West Side Story. However, homosexuals 
have not been fairly represented in the media quite yet.
"For years, weve been presented as prancing, mincing 
stereotypes, pathological killers, or suicidal depressives,
wrote Michael Jensen of AfterElton.com. At the Oscars, Phillip 
Seymour Hoffman was honored as best actor for portraying 
Truman Capote, whose effeminate personality is a perfect 
fit for the stereotype of the gay man that Hollywood loves to 
promote. Brokeback Mountain was different in that it told the 
story of two gay men who were also extremely masculine.
With rare exception, the title of best picture has traditionally 
been given to the film with the most critical acclaim, box 
office revenue, and pre-Oscar awards. This year that film was 
Brokeback Moun tain.
So why did Crash win? In the entertainment industry, Crash 
and Black. White, occupy the same niche: They appear 
groundbreaking, but are actually safe. Crash creates a world 
in which racism is overt, and thus easy to identify and 
eliminate. Instead of exploring the deeper issues alienating 
blacks and whites from each other, Black. White, focuses on 
the inevitable drama that ensues when two families have to 
live under one roof.
In the end, you have to remember that both the Academy 
Awards and Black. White, are Hollywood endeavors  above 
all else, drama is at a premium. Even if the best picture upset 
was anything but progressive, it has probably inspired more 
conversation than even a victory by Brokeback would have 
achieved. And Black. White., despite its flaws, has certainly 
gotten a lot of attention for its unique premise. Before truth, 
these productions want to show us conflict in the most 
dramaticized way possible. Whether youre watching FX or 
the Academy Awards, if you want an accurate portrayal of 
racism in America, you might want to turn off the TV.

Greek Sing spoofs musicals
Fraternities and sororities raise money for Doctors Without Borders
Top: Kwasi Mensah of Sig Ep performs Moulin Rouge 
with his fraternity and Kappa sorority.
Bottom: Gabriel King, a KDR brother, performs in KDR's 
and DG's rendition of Big River.
Wait. Were we supposed to take this seriously?" a member 
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon joked as he ran off the stage. Well, 
that depends on whom you asked, Greek Sing, which was 
held in the Soldiers and Sailors auditorium* on Saturday night, 
featured some very professional and some more amateur 
performances by the fraternities and sororities at Carnegie 
Mellon. In fact, it seemed more appropriate to divide Greek 
Sing not into singles and "doubles" (in which a sorority and 
fraternity perform together) but rather "serious and "spoofs."
As the house lights dimmed, the musical theater seniors took 
the stage and set the bar high with their performance of songs 
from Rent and a parody of Urinetown. Their performance 
was obviously well- rehearsed and their stage presence 
was undeniable, as audience members stood and cheered 
throughout the songs.
The three acts that followed  Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha 
Epsilon Pi, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon, 
and Kappa Alpha Theta and Phi Kappa Theta  also had 
put obvious effort into their sets and costumes. Although the 
vocals from these performances were not as strong as later 
performances, these fraternities and sororities made the most 
of what their brothers and sisters could offer.
Also featuring wonderfully creative costumes was Kappa 
Alpha Theta and Phi Kappa Thetas performance of Once on 
This Island, which kept the buzz going as Act I finished up. 
Henry Te from Phi Kappa Theta explained that, even though 
putting the performance together was a daunting task, "the 
most rewarding part of Greek Sing is being able to physically 
see the positive aspects of the Greek community come to life. 
Just like in Booth, Buggy and other philanthropic events, we 
all have a first-hand experience in what it means to be part 
of a brotherhood [or] sisterhood. Everybody has a good time 
while developing bonds that last a lifetime while benefitting 
the community as well.
After the intermission, the mood changed dramatically as 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon took the stage. Taking the unique 
approach of explaining the history of pop culture icons Boyz

Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Epsilon Pi took a creative 
approach to The Rocky Honor Picture Show. The most 
outstanding character was a "transsexual Transylvanian" 
dressed in fishnet stockings, heels, and a corset. Following, 
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Kappa Kappa Gammas performance 
of Moulin Rouge featured an elaborate light-up backdrop 
and colorful costumes that made up for a few missed steps 
in the choreography here and there. Andrea Crews, a sister 
.in Kappa Kappa Gamma, explained, "The separate pieces 
[concept, choreography, costumes, music, sets, etc.] can all 
be handled separately or delegated, but actually putting the 
show together is the most challenging. You never know if you 
need more sets or if costume changes will be too difficult or 
if you have less room to dance than expected." Clearly, those 
obstacles were overcome in Saturdays show.
II Men, Sigma Alpha Epsilons performance featured brothers 
dressed as Superman, a hot dog, and a cloud. While less 
serious than other performances, the crowd roared at the end 
of their show.
Delta Delta Delta and Pi Kappa Alpha took the stage next with 
their own creative version of Wedding Crashers. One of the 
more memorable scenes had the brothers and sisters dancing 
on stage surrounded by dancers wielding colorful ribbons.
Still on the funnier side, Beta Theta Pi put on a less energetic 
performance of Ghostbusters, but still managed to make the 
audience laugh.
The audience went wild as Delta Gamma and Kappa Delta 
Rho took the stage for their version of Big River. Featuring 
hands-down the best vocals and choreography, it became 
clear that this performance would have fit in better with those 
from Act I. Theta Xi kept the bar high with The Graduate, 
chock full of sexual innuendo and memorable songs.
Regardless of whether or not the event was taken seriously 
by all the performers, Greek Sing managed to raise $12,000 
for the charity Doctors Without Borders. The first awards of 
the night were given to Delta Delta Delta for raising the most 
money and Kappa Kappa Gamma for being the most helpful 
to the Chairman. In the singles division, Theta Xi took first 
place, followed by Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Beta Theta Pi in 
second and third place, respectively. In the doubles division, 
Delta Gamma and Kappa Delta Rho were the clear winners of 
not only the first-place trophy but also the overall achievement 
award. In second place were Alpha Epsilon Pi and Alpha Chi 
Omega, followed by Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon in third.

Carnegie Mellon School of 
Drama graduates are involved 
in As the World Turns. Tamara 
Tunie plays Jessica Griffin. 
Van Hansis plays Luke Snyder. 
Chris Goutman is executive 
producer.
CFA grads make their mark on As The World Turns
CFA and As The World Turns celebrate .milestones in the arts
No television show does ambition, desire, trouble, 
misunderstanding, sexiness, or temptation better than one 
with an abundance of Carnegie Mellon grads involved in it.
As the World Turns, the daytime soap about daily life in 
a small town in the Midwest, turns 50 on April 2. It has 
outlasted any similar television program of the time, and 
millions of viewers have visited the lives of the good  and 
bad  people of Oakdale for generations. The drama has won 
42 Daytime Emmy Awards, garnering 12 nominations in 2006 
alone. It has a long past to commemorate and an impressive 
history to acknowledge.
"One of [the programs] biggest strengths is its history," said 
Chris Goutman, executive producer of As the World Turns.
"We have a mandate to be true to that.
The Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts celebrates its legacy 
this year. Almost a century's worth of graduates has touched 
the arts around the world. Goutman graduated from the 
School of Drama with a masters degree in 1976. He went on 
from Carnegie Mellon to work with many projects as a writer, 
director, producer, and actor before he started with the soap 
opera in 1999. As the World Turns runs about 250 shows every 
year, and Goutman said he has called upon all his training in 
making sure that the show's course is "true and steady."
For its 50th anniversary, As the World Turns will air episodes 
that parody th era it came from. The special episodes, which 
will feature actors from the soap itself, will air bn Friday and 
next Monday. They will use the style of television programs 
from the '50s and '60s, like I Love Lucy. In the episodes, seven 
divas riding in a bus will get lost, and the bus will crash as 
they get in what Goutman calls a "delicious predicament."
For more, check out the fun episodes. The adventures of the 
divas will visit aspects of the program's past and show how 
far its come.
"Its a light-hearted look at where we came from ... and hip, 
irreverent fun, Goutman said.
Tamara Tunie, who plays As the World Turns character 
Jessica Griffin, will star in the I Love Lucy segment of the 
anniversary episode. Tunie grew up in Homestead and 
graduated from the School of Drama with a bachelors degree 
in 1981.
It was one of the best times of my life, said Tunie. CMU 
prepared me for what I was embarking on ... a well-rounded 
career.
Tunie joined As the World Turns in 1987. After 18 years, 
with some brief hiatuses from the show, Tunie enjoys the 
constant presence of the soap job. "It's been a great kind of 
touchstone  I know its there," she said. Tunie also has a 
role in the television drama Law and Order: Special Victims 
Unit, and she balances her time with other productions that 
she works in, including three new projects in which she is 
producer or director. About every other year, Tunie loves to 
take part in Shakespeare productions. She also has a husband 
and an active home life.
"Ive always been a multi-tasker. I believe in saying yes [to 
new projects].... If you think it's possible, you can do it," said 
Tunie. There are more hours in the day than we think there 
are.
Rising actors have a lot to worry about, and Tunie advises 
constant persistence and enjoyment of the soul food of acting. 
Tunie's career has taken her many places, and her roles have 
left impressions on thousands of living rooms. Celebrating 
actresses like her is a major part of the anniversaries of As the 
World Turns and CFA. But more than that, the celebrations 
also anticipate the futures of artists who have long and fruitful 
careers waiting to happen.
One such artist, Van Hansis, graduated from the School of 
Drama in 2004. He signed with an agency after the schools 
showcase  an event where senior actors travel and perform 
in Los Angeles and New York. He started on As the World 
Turns in December 2005 as a replacement actor for the 
character Luke Snyder.
As the World Turns often has its characters involved in hot 
topics of society. For instance, Hansis' character is getting 
into a homosexual relationship, much to the displeasure of 
Lukes father. Luke, as a possible part of the soap's next big 
couple, must grapple with the prejudices of society and find 
out what he should do.
Hansis himself has been lauded by Out magazine, and his 
fledgling career has earned fan mail and a popular online blog. 
Hansis is really enjoying working with a show that has such a 
large amount of history behind it.
"As far as soaps go, this one is all about family and 
connections," said Hansis. "To a lot of young people, its like 
the comfort food of TV.... I think its easy to get sucked into 
the show."
Hansis credits Carnegie Mellon with many lessons that have 
benefited his career. He says he applies what he learned 
during his time as an undergrad every day. "CMU has very 
high standards. If youre not pulling your own weight, the 
professors make it known," he said. "Theres a mentality of 
staying at the top of your game and a drive for excellence."
Hansis said that the School of Drama has an excellent 
reputation in the acting industry, citing sold-out performances 
for the schools most recent New York showcase. Hansis said 
that one of his proudest achievements is graduating from 
Carnegie Mellon. To current actors here, Hansis said, You're 
sitting on a gold mine right now. I didn't realize how much 
there was to take advantage of.... Just realize that youre 
making a great career move."
The Carnegie Mellon School of Drama and As the World Turns 
prove that there is no business like show business. As the 
television program and CFA celebrate huge milestones, they 
prove the power of their legacies and the passion of their art.

Doom-ed to bomb
Video game movies square off against repeated failure
As video games embed themselves deeper into the collective 
consciousness of planet Earth, entertainers will continue 
searching for ways to capitalize on the trend. Financially, the 
video game industry has started to eclipse the Hollywood 
box office in terms of revenue, and people are starting to 
realize that games arent just games. Peripherally related 
game merchandise is becoming more and more common. You 
can see novels at Barnes & Noble that expand on a games 
storyline, game soundtracks for sale at Tower Records, and 
gamer-themed shirts at "trendy shops like Hot Topic and 
Urban Outfitters. Gaming even has its own cable TV station
 G4TV.
But what happens when video games make the ultimate bigmedia crossover and become huge blockbuster films?
Super Mano Brothers, released by Buena Vista in 1993, 
started the trend of video game films that bombed at the 
box office after being almost universally lambasted by critics 
and fans. The film took the nonsensical but beloved setting 
for Nintendos landmark Mario Brothers games and gave it a 
grimy, post-industrial twist with hammy acting from heavies 
like Dennis Hopper, Bob Hoskins, and John Leguizamo.
The old saying goes, "You cant squeeze blood from a turnip." 
In the same vein, you cant squeeze a workable story from a 
basic premise. In the early years of gaming, most games had 
a tenuous story, just enough to keep the player moving from 
point A to point B and completing the required tasks along 
the way.
Nevertheless, simple stories can, in fact, be pulled off with 
skill. The third highest-grossing video game movie of all 
time was Mortal Kombat, a movie based on a fighting game
 a genre of games notorious for having little to no real 
story. In the Mortal Kombat movie, though, director Paul 
Anderson managed to keep the "feel" of the game intact while 
expanding on the story and creating a relatively filled-out, if 
not extremely cheesy, plotline. That was the key to Mortal 
Kombat's success  if it had shed all ties with the game, it 
stall would have made sense as a movie and could have met 
with moderate popularity.
It seems that not everyone learns from cautionary tales, 
though. The recently released Doom movie should have been 
an easy hit. Doom is one of the most recognized names in 
gaming history  it's the ultra-violent first-person-shooter 
that jump-started modem PC gaming, and its long-awaited 
third installment was released just last year. The story of the 
games involves a portal to hell opening in a lab on Mars, with 
thousands of demons flowing out from it. Your job in Doom, as 
an unnamed Marine, is to quell the demon tide. With bullets.
Demons from hell and lots of big guns should be an easy hit 
in movie theaters, but Doom has only made back about half 
of its $60 million budget. Doom cut corners on special effects, 
and at many points the monsters in the game looked more 
impressive than the monsters on the big screen. A lackluster 
cast whose biggest stars were former wrestler The Rock and 
Karl Urban, who played a second-tier character in the Lord 
of the Rings trilogy, didn't help either. While a movie about 
Marines fighting horrible monsters doesnt exactly need 
Oscar-quality acting, the rules of any movie still apply. Studios 
need actors who can hold the audiences attention with more 
than their biceps.
Doom failed because it gave up on its source material and it 
forgot that you cant say "good video game movie without
good movie." Have there been any video game movies that 
havent failed miserably? That question is two-pronged
 movies can fail in the eyes of the games fans, and they can 
fail in the eyes of the box office. Resident Evil, based on the 
seminal zombie horror games, stuck almost exactly to the plot 
of the first game, pleasing fans but guaranteeing a less-thanstellar box office performance. The Tomb Raider movies have 
been astonishingly successful, but that is understandable 
for two reasons: the star power of leading lady Angelina 
Jolie and their huge production budget. While neither movie 
was particularly popular with critics, the films performed 
comparably to other summer action blockbusters.
Thankfully, there is real hope on the horizon for video game 
movies. Coming out in April, Silent Hill has taken extremely 
high production values to adapt a psychologically devastating 
story and imagery to the big screen. The movie has been 
advertising aggressively and may turn out to be the best 
video game movie yet. Next summer, the 800-pound gorilla of 
the game industry, Microsoft's Halo series, will finally see the 
silver screen. The movie, funded by both Fox and Universal, 
will have Peter Jackson as executive producer, and his special 
effects shop WETA Digital will be handling the effects. Can 
Peter Jackson, Lord of the Nerds, finally convince the world 
that video games arent just, well, games? Time will tell, but 
millions of gamers are watching closely to find out.

Ghost World
Wednesday, March 29 
81012
We all know the signs of the non
conformist pair of girls who fall 
outside normal categories. Even 
though theres a pair in almost 
every high school, we cant seem 
to place them in a stereotype; 
instead, each creates its own 
category. Enid and Rebecca 
are best friends who escape 
stereotypes and spend part of 
their pre-college summer playing a 
prank on an older man, Seymour. 
The love story that develops 
between Enid and Seymour defies 
typical love stories, for Ghost World 
is not your stereotypical movie.
Man Bites Dog
Thursday, March 30 
81012
Can you believe it? This film is 
rated NC-17! Documenting a 
philosophical serial killer is not 
the regular fare of thrillers, and 
Man Bites Dog pulls off horror 
very well. A main course of gore 
with a side of stewed theories is 
always fun. Sardonic humor makes 
the pseudo-documentary more 
interesting than, say, The Texas 
Chainsaw Massacre, but this film 
will not appeal to those who like to 
see the human body in one piece. 
As critic James Berardinelli wrote, 
this film shows all parts of the 
human body, inside and out.
Pride and Prejudice

Yay for British adaptations and hot 
actresses! This is like the Victorian 
TBA (well, almost). If you want to 
see this film, you probably know 
the story, so well say that this film 
version of Jane Austens novel does 
the adaptation  done so many 
times before  very well. I give 
major props to Deborah Moggach, 
the screenwriter, for making good 
cuts and getting the length just 
over two hours. Keira Knightley 
rocks this film with an awesome 
performance, and in watching the 
film, you feel like a part of the 19th 
century. Its a feat few films achieve.

If you heard anything about the 
Oscars, you heard about this film.
If you want to hear about corrupt 
politicians, this film is for you.
The plot elements, while fictional, 
all revolve around true stories 
about the private businesses who 
. make our public policy. Trying to 
summarize this movie will never 
work, because the plot is so dense 
and intricate. I love involved plots, 
because sometimes the simple 
sugary stories get too boring for our 
complex minds.

Politics and Fashion: A look at how society is
Spring fashion. It just sdunds refreshing. One pictures a 
warm breeze, freshly picked strawberries, and fake-baked 
supermodels strewn about a cool beach somewhere magical. 
It's that place where miniscule bikinis topped by weightless 
linen clothing are standard 24/7, and sunscreen is second only 
to over-marketed Ralph Lauren perfume.
But can this image of the new spring fashions evolve to 
produce something meaningful, something understood by 
the masses (rather than just mindlessly sold to them at a high 
profit margin)? Annually, the time comes when the auburn 
scarves and the black canvas boots must be replaced by the 
lighter, more airy colors of the pre-summer months. As such 
a replacement is indeed a routine one, it becomes difficult to 
see fashion and clothing as anything but a cycle of re-printed 
and re-sewn fabrics. However, there has to be something 
more to spring fashion. Its existence is far too pervasive to not 
have some common ties with society as a whole.
It may be said that a society can be broken up into cultural, 
political, and economic sectors. Fashion, while typically 
regarded as a monotonous measure of wealth and supposed 
cultural superiority, may actually be able to unite these three 
sections. On a straightforward level, clothing is a societal 
trend whose success is decided by its rate of purchase 
by consumers. It is related to economics. Moreover, while 
definitions of "culture" change from individual to individual, 
most will agree that fashion, a notion faintly abstract and 
serving as a measure of society, traditionally falls under the 
cultural sector. Finally, fashion unites the previous two groups 
to that of the political realm by, at times, incorporating the 
themes behind contemporary political movements into the 
clothing worn by citizens on the street.
How do these three parts of society become one under spring 
fashion? The major ideas this spring emphasize military 
and Victorian trends, underscored by what InStyle calls 
icy, metallic embellishments, like costume jewelry and a 
turn toward rich hues. Colors such as aqua, turquoise, and 
clementine orange highlight details on cropped blazers and 
Bermuda shorts that mimic a reduced military attire theme. 
"West Coast designers, says Women's Wear Daily, are going 
for sleek, sophisticated looks this season, from sharp blazers 
and comfy sweaters to chic dresses and tops. Moreover, 
trends this spring bring to light the advent of the all-white 
outfit, where relaxed cotton tanks (such as a rib boy beater 
tank by American Apparel, which you can find in Shadyside) 
are paired with detailed, pronounced, Victorian-style balloon 
skirts. Designer label Bottega Veaeta unites the professional 
military attire with this all-white trend in its spring line.
(see photo at left). As commented on by Style.com, "With 
their eyelet, lace, and openwork embroidery, spring's white 
[fashions] are devotional exercises in needlecraft.
Traditionally, military-inspired clothing is banally olive green 
or brown in color, and features oversized pockets and too 
many utility zippers to count. But this season, designers have 
been influenced by the more ornate, feminine appeal of the 
clothing of the Victorian era. The fashions fostered by this 
movement were demure, highly form-fitting, and appealed to 
an image of the supposed "ideal pear-shaped woman.
So what results from the union of these seemingly opposite 
looks? For the trend, think fluid, not baggy. Ungussied, yet 
not exactly simple," says Women's Wear Daily. The military 
bomber jacket, (such as the leather version from Roberta 
Weissburg Leathers in Shadyside (see photo at right), is toned 
down towards the fitted blazer look of the Victorian era, worn 
with pinstripe tops and skinny shorts. An example of this look 
can be found at BCBG Max Azria in South Side Works, (see 
photo at far right).
All of this seasons looks are complemented by the heavy, 
earth-toned jewelry influenced by the military look. That is, 
multiple layers of metallic-hued and white chains emerge, 
draped heavily around the neck to be instantly noticed in 
contrast to the simplified rayon knits and linens populating 
the spring fashion scene, triumphant in their crisp natural 
white hues. This costume-like jewelry is reminiscent of the 
ornate strands of gold and jewels of the Victorian era, which 
are now mockingly reduced to plastic, at such stores as Urban 
Outfitters at South Side Works, or ostentatious in silvers and 
stones, at such stores as The Culture Shop in the South Side.
Where else can you find evidence of the military-goneVictorian trend in the Steel City? While Pittsburgh may not 
be known for its particular creativity on the fashion front, 
it is-in fact home to country-wide chain stores as well as 
bohemian-style clothing boutiques. It is at these eclectic 
shops that the simplified all-white and natural-colored top and 
bottom trend, complemented by boisterous metallic aquaand orange-shaded jewelry, is easily spotted. The Culture 
Shop boasts long, flowing skirts easily paired with cotton 
tank tops, mounds of silver and jewel-toned necklaces and 
bracelets designed to be stacked up ones arm, and other 
clothing designed and imported from East and South Asia.
It is such bohemian clothing that sparks the trend of fashion 
molded from linens and other relaxed fabric textures, a trend 
paralleling and often incorporating the suit separates look 
fostered by the union of the military and Victorian ideas. 
Avalon Exchange, a well-known Oakland shop specializing in 
the re-sale of contemporary fashion items, could also be home 
to such eclectic clothing.
V%-Pittsburgh also possesses stores presenting the militaryVictorian trend from a preppier angle. The Pittsburgh Jeans 
Company, located in the South Side, provides a costlier, more 
tousled version of Abercrombie and Fitch attire. Worn-out 
denim attire is standard and embellished, and solid cotton 
tank tops are packaged and sold to the buyer as an image of 
Pittsburgh-gone-glam. This simplified version of the relaxed 
look is further perpetuated by South Side Works' Urban 
Outfitters, where an alternative version of the pinstripe 
separates suit is found in cotton gaucho pants and solid, darksand-colored Bermuda shorts.
With the military-inspired look so prevalent, we must 
question: Why is it pervading our culture? What is so 
appealing about resembling a daintier version of a 
government officer? In this, the beginning of the 21st 
century, American politics is centered upon the controversy 
surrounding the pros and cons of being involved in a war in 
the Middle East. As average citizens are becoming involved

affecting this springs trends

in the debate, voicing their opinions on how the war affects 
them in their daily lives, the political sector of society is 
evolving from solely involving the dictators of American social 
hierarchy (the government) to integrating this previously 
dominant voice with that of the people. The people, . 
traditionally thought of as singly composing the cultural 
section of American society, have now broken the barriers 
between the three political, economic, and cultural sectors.
Fashion exists as a societal notion that is reserved for those 
interested in physical aesthetics and uninvolved in "real 
political movements and culture. However, if we are noticing 
this growing breach in the long-established separation of 
fashion and politics by the military influence in clothing, is 
fashion more dynamic than previously thought? Of course 
those studying its strictly aesthetic, seasonal evolution will 
say yes. But what about the majority of the population? The 
movement towards bridging these cultural and political 
realms, through the power of economic consumer purchase, is 
one that is recognized by high-label designers and the chainstore owners alike. Nevertheless, for real change to occur, the 
impact of a movement or event should be acknowledged by 
the general population of the society.
How can this happen? The change must be gradual, as is 
any sort of effective cultural resistance. The introduction of 
the military style of clothing, in this Victorian-style way, with 
heavy costume jewelry and lighter fabric colors, has been 
slowly diffusing throughout the fashion industry. When the 
notion of the war in Iraq first became well-understood and 
openly discussed by citizens, the hackneyed olive greens 
and browns began to infiltrate the fashion culture. Now, 
after a few years, the real motives behind the military look 
are coming into play: All are involved, even young female 
fashionistas seemingly unassociated with the politics of the 
war. The look is prevalent in society, and if informed, everyone 
can understand how this bridge between politics and fashion 
paints a picture of a unified social view.
And what of the relaxed look? Does it work in conjuncture 
with the military-Victorian trend in society, or does it fight 
it? The all-white look in soft linens and flexible rayon knits 
suggests a look towards a purer alternative to the dark colors 
of war. "Thankfully, wearing white after Labor Day is no longer 
a fashion faux pas," comments Karen Johnston of InStyle. 
Then again, the movement could be in conjuncture with the 
military awareness trend by consumers looking for inspiration 
in clothing from a globalized perspective  textured linens 
and rich jade and orange hues suggest a Mediterranean and 
Middle Eastern influence. Furthermore, it may be possible 
that a turn toward naturally-colored clothing is just a seasonal 
change in the world of fashion, and is simply coincidentally 
popular at the same time.
Regardless of the specific interrelations of the major trends 
in fashion at any given-moment, it is fabulous to note how 
conducive our current society is to the use of fashion to break 
down the border between aesthetic culture, economics, and 
politics. So get out to Shadyside, the Waterfront, or the South 
Side, and explore what fashion Pittsburgh has to offer.

Deal with it!
Cope with your post-spring-break stress
Throbbing pain is starting from your forehead and spreading 
to your temples. Your vision seems blurry and you can't 
focus on your laptop. A tension headache like this one could 
be caused by many things: inadequate rest, mental stress, 
hunger, or fatigue. Sound like your Wednesday night?
College students are notorious for their high-stress, pressured 
lifestyles. At this time of year, the second week after spring 
break, students are hit particularly hard. Surely you've noticed 
how much the semester seems to become one giant cram 
session after March 15. As well as classwork, students combat 
job and internship searches, hunt for housing, and work 
to finalize research and thesis projects. Linda Hooper, the 
director of Academic Development, notes that after midterm 
grades come out, the attendance at tutoring and other help 
sessions goes up significantly.
Each person deals with stress differently, but students 
experiencing stress from multiple sources (not just 
schoolwork, but job searches, for instance) must leam to 
prioritize. They must also try to stay stable so they dont ruin 
their chances at a job by looking like an underfed zombie at 
their interviews.
Academic Development started running stress and time 
management sessions a few years ago in response to student 
demand for help with these issues. Hooper noted that there 
are five things a student should do to help with stress levels.
Get support: Call a friend and instead of bitching about 
work, talk about V for Vendetta and how awesome it was. 
Look up: Stay on the sunny side of life, perhaps by buying a 
frozen fruit bar  a guaranteed pick-me-up, by all accounts. 
Laugh more: Your physics problem set might be ruining your 
life, but your professors accent is pretty hilarious, especially if
you mimic it while reciting lines from Zoolander.
Get in shape: If you don't have time for long workouts, try 
short walks instead. It helps clear your head and has the 
added bonus of airing out that sweater you havent washed 
since February.
Believe: Have something you believe in, on an individual 
level. This can be as conventional as Catholicism or as wonky 
as talking to trees.
Time management can seem impossible. There are weeks 
when things dont actually fit into the open slots you have 
available,-especially when activities such as Greek Sing or 
intramural tennis add to your commitments. Jody Lange, 
who last semester balanced work as a second-year grad 
student in design and a full-time employee at PR firm BursonMarsteller, has been combating high-stress situations for 
years. Assignments often come in on the fly, and Lange has 
to debate whether she'll write an ad for a client or stick with 
her other time commitments. She emphasizes the importance 
of having a list that can be adapted throughout the day. She 
also remembers the words of Stephen Covey, author of First 
Things First and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. She 
explains his concept as essentially saying that "unless we 
make the time for things that are important but not urgent, 
well never get to them, because we do the things that are 
urgent first. One simple example can be attempting to make 
time for your friends when you have small assignments 
popping up. The urgent things must not rule your life.
Its one thing to tell yourself you will try to take time out and 
get support to help reduce stress. But students can forget 
even the most stem advice in the way of their many tasks. I 
suggest accomplishing things even while you rest from the 
most stressful work. Break from your 12-page paper and take 
a walk. But instead of walking to the Kraus Campo, walk to
Entropy and pick up a yogurt. Or go check your snail mail.
Or make your friend in West Wing happy by finally returning 
his copy of Booze, Broads, and Bullets. By accomplishing 
something while resting from your urgent work, you will get 
your chores done while still taking a break.
Achieving the balance between job search and academic 
work can be the hardest stressor of all. Finding an internship 
is stress from start to finish. "Its like diving into the ocean 
from outer space and hoping you land on an island," said 
Allison Kolb, a junior creative writing major, about the 
daunting search for summer work. Students must be aware of 
how a high stress level could afreet them during interviews. 
Both academic work and summer jobs can seem equally 
important. At the risk of sounding like your mom, I suggest 
you start quite early.
Part of the benefit of an early start will allow you to take your 
cover letter and r6sum6 to Career Services. Occasionally they 
offer walk-in service and will look over these materials for 
you. Lange, who in addition to her work for Burson-Marsteller 
also teaches a course in corporate communications, said that 
proofreading is a vital part of the process for materials you 
send to an employer. Set aside 30 minutes for yourself or a 
friend to look over your cover letter before you send it into the 
world.
Another thing Lange said helps score employment is to truly 
have passion for the job you are applying for. Note your love of 
the field or excitement about the position in cover letters and 
during interviews. I know time is tight, but youll thank me 
later when you're working for Google.
