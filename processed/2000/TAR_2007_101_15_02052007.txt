Thirteen years after Lycos was 
created at Carnegie Mellon, a 
brand new spin-off hopes to rev
olutionize the budding software 
assurance industry. Sure Logic, a 
software company founded late 
last year, is using research from 
Carnegie Mellons Fluid Project, 
a software assurance research
program in SS, to develop 
software that kills the hardestto-find bugs in the most critical 
systems.
Software assurance is a lucra
tive field, considering that every 
year bugs in computer software 
cause $60 billion in damages 
worldwide, according to Bill 
Scherlis, professor of computer 
science and director of Carnegie 
Mellons Institute for Software 
Research.
The Research
Sure Logics software tools 
are based on research regard
ing software reliability and as
surance conducted by Scherlis. 
Jonathan Aldrich, Scherlis col
league and fellow professor in 
the School of Computer Science, 
has also made several large con
tributions.
Scherlis, recruited by Allen 
Newell to the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency 
(DARPA) in 1986, came back to 
Carnegie Mellon in 1993 to work 
on dependability as part of the 
Fluid Project.
My research is focused on 
how to write software about 
which you can make promises, 
Scherlis said. Software is every
where, its an amazing kind of a 
construction material if you can

When the subject is sustain
ability, Carnegie Mellon does 
not quite make the deans list. 
The university received a C+ in 
a study conducted by the Sus
tainable Endowments Institute, 
which rated universities based 
on campus sustainability policy 
and endowment shareholder 
practices.
The study, released January 
24, graded over 100 colleges and 
universities on 26 main factors 
from green-building initiatives 
to endowment investment poli
cies with a letter grade from A to 
F. Among the schools surveyed, 
four received an overall grade of 
A, 22 received Bs, 54 Cs, and 20 
Ds.
Carnegie Mellons individual 
report card had three As, a B, a 
C, and two Fs, clearly indicating 
points both strong and weak. 
The As were received in admin
istration, climate change and 
energy, and green building; the 
B was given for food and recy
cling. Meanwhile, a C was given 
for investment priorities and the 
Fs for endowment transparency 
and shareholder engagement. 
The disparity shows a clear di
vide between Carnegie Mellons 
endowment policies and campus 
efforts.
I dont really see how we 
could be given such a low score, 
said H&SS first-year JoAnna 
Hartzmark, since I feel like our 
campus has always been so dedi
cated to green initiatives.
Although Carnegie Mellons 
overall grade was a C+, its high 
marks in campus sustainability 
policy placed it among the few 
schools to receive an average of 
an A- or better in that category.
I think that we should be 
very proud that Carnegie Mellon
is listed as one of the 26 campus 
sustainability leaders, said Barb 
Kviz, head of Carnegie Mellons 
Green Practices Committee. 
The categories that we received 
high marks on reflect how we 
operate and strive to improve 
green practices on campus.
The Green Practices Commit
tee consists of faculty, staff, and 
students from all areas of study. 
The committee is divided into 
subcommittees that meet once 
a month to discuss current and 
future environmental initiatives 
on campus.
In addition, both students and 
administrators have undertaken 
a variety of initiatives in order to 
achieve sustainability on cam
pus.
Sustainable Engineering, a 
partnership between Carnegie 
Mellon, the University of Texas 
at Austin, and Arizona State Uni
versity, is dedicated to helping 
faculty members update their 
courses to account for rapidly 
changing conditions in the envi
ronment and the economy that 
are transforming the practice of 
engineering.
Currently, university data 
shows that there are about 600 
students on the Carnegie Mel
lon campus enrolled in environment-related classes.
Sustainable Earth is a student 
organization that assists in the 
creation and development of oncampus initiatives. Currently, 
it is leading Recyclemania, a 
campus-wide program to step up 
recycling efforts. According to a 
Carnegie Mellon study last year, 
40 percent of our garbage could 
have been recycled, yet was not.
I feel like Ive never really 
noticed all the things we do for 
the environment, said CFA firstyear Alyssa Fogel. We are all so 
busy that sometimes we forget.

To the audience at the mascot 
town hall meeting held in McConomy Auditorium last Monday, 
one thing was certainCarnegie 
Mellon needs an official mascot.
The meeting was hosted by the 
Mascot Task Force, a group of 
students and staff members who 
plan to propose an official mas
cot and mascot graphic for the 
university. Specifically, the group 
was soliciting opinions to decide 
whether to legitimize the univer
sitys current, unofficial mascot, 
the Scottie dog, or to create a new 
mascot altogether. Suggestions 
included a highlander, a lumber
jack, the Tartan Tigahs, the 
Carnegie Mellon Crocs, Terry 
the Tartan, and, paying homage 
to Carnegie Mellons founders, 
Andy.
Another proposal suggests hav
ing one official mascot as well as 
several other icons that would be 
representative of the community, 
such as a highlander or a bag
pipe.
Nathan Frank, a first-year eco
nomics major and member of the 
task force, began the meeting 
with a PowerPoint presentation 
outlining the groups goals. The 
group clarified that it was not 
planning to change the name 
Tartans, but to establish a vi
sual representation of an official 
mascot. In addition, the group 
answered questions via the Pow
erPoint ranging from the basic 
What could the Carnegie Mel
lon mascot be? to the weightier 
Are gender, race, and Scottish 
tradition important? and What 
would a costume and design rep
resent?
All other icons adopted by the 
school have been by students, 
said Jennifer Church, dean of 
Student Affairs.
The group stressed the impor
tance of student involvement 
during the town hall meeting. 
The meetings leaders asked the 
audience to rate aspects they 
would deem suitable for an offi
cial mascot; for instance, fierce 
vs. not so fierce and realistic 
vs. cartoon/caricature, in an at
tempt to gauge the kind of visual 
representation that would meet 
students approval.

IncidentShawn Wertz
My grandparents, like so many other 
Carnegie Mellon parents and grandpar
ents, have the telltale sticker affixed to 
their back window that says Carnegie 
Mellon. Theirs, in particular, also has 
the image of a Scottie dog next to the 
name of the university.
The terriers image has become popu
lar in other aspects of my home life. 
My grandmother purchased a statue 
of a Scottie dog shortly after my ac
ceptance. It greets visitors at the front 
door during all four seasons. And while 
she is still unaware that the dog isnt 
an official mascot of the university, its 
symbolism is still as powerful as ever. 
For my family, its a reminder that Im 
at school striving for bigger and better 
things. Its a symbol of the pride my 
family has in me, and the pride I have 
in my school.
Despite appearances, the Scottie dog 
is not an official mascot, a fact brought 
to the forefront of campus attention 
with the recent meetings of the Mascot 
Task Force to discuss the possibility 
of selecting an official mascot. As of 
now, were known as the Tartans, which 
leads me to assume that our only actual 
mascot now is a piece of tartan plaid.
We Carnegie Mellon students seem to 
be at a juncture when it comes to choos
ing an official mascot. The task could 
prove more complicated than originally 
thought. While I have my own feelings 
about what a mascot should represent 
to me, each student has his or her own 
preferences, because everyone has a 
different experience.
A mascot is supposed to unite the 
entire campus during large gatherings, 
times when we can put the books down 
for a few seconds and cheer for our 
peers.
And with the recent meetings of the 
Mascot Task Force last Monday and 
Wednesday to discuss the possibility of 
finally choosing an official mascot, 
having a singular, unifying mascot may 
be closer now than ever before.
While some of the mascot possibilities 
seem absurd to me, I have close friends 
who would love to be known as the 
Carnegie Mellon Loch Ness Monsters 
or the Tartan Tigahs. Though Ive 
made it obvious what my tastes are with 
regard to Carnegie Mellons mascot, I 
feel that regardless of which mascot is 
actually chosen, its important that the 
mascot be the most representative of 
Carnegie Mellons campus as a whole.
But that is easier said than done. 
If there is one thing I have learned 
from my time here, its that Carnegie 
Mellon is extremely diverse. It is hard 
to imagine that any one mascot could 
accurately portray the variety of indi
viduals on campus.
The editorial board experienced 
these diverse preferences firsthand, as 
we struggled to write an editorial that 
would represent all the members of the 
Tartan. We had a rather difficult time 
cementing any particular viewpoint, 
and even the one we did manage to 
share was not unanimous. And if you 
read the editorial, you will see that one 
of us wishes our mascot was the Loch 
Ness Monster.
Perhaps the only issue I have with 
selecting an official mascot is that we 
lose a tiny piece of Carnegie Mellonhood that made us different from the 
other universities. We were just plaid.
And that is why, even against my 
personal preferences, I realize that per
haps being the Tartan plaid is a perfect 
fit. With all of its colors, tartan plaid 
already represents the diverse mixture 
of people on campus. Without that 
mixture, without our own unique, plaid
like human network, it just wouldnt be 
the same.
Heres to Carnegie Mellon being for
ever plaid.

Campus News in Brief
Shabbat1000
The smell of traditional Jewish foods will 
fill Carnegie Mellons Wiegand Gymnasium in 
the University Center on Friday as students, 
faculty, and other members of the Pittsburgh 
community gather for Shabbat 1000, an annual 
campus event held to celebrate the traditional 
Jewish day of rest. The program will provide a 
filling three-course meal for, organizers hope, 
1000 participants. Attendees will be served 
traditional Shabbat foods such as gefilte fish, a 
variety of kugels, challah rolls, salads, desserts, 
and several vegetarian options.
The atmosphere will be one of celebration, 
joy, and unity, said Chani Weinstein, Pitts
burghs Shabbat 1000 administrator. Several 
student groups from Carnegie Mellon, includ
ing Alpha Epsilon Pi, Zeta Beta Tau, Israel on 
Campus, and Tartans for Israel, have joined 
other groups in the Pittsburgh area to help in 
the planning, promotion, and implementation 
of the event.
Shabbat 1000 is a national event started 12 
years ago by Rivka Slonim, co-director of the 
Chabad House at the State University of New 
York at Binghamton. Cornell University, Har
vard University, Pennsylvania State University, 
and the University of Texas are just a few of the
universities that have brought the Shabbat 1000 
tradition to their own campuses.
This unique campus event offers students 
an opportunity to meet and connect with oth
ers and to share in the traditional celebration 
of Shabbat  something special beyond their 
weekly routine, Weinstein said. The actual 
event is very inspiring to see so many students 
celebrating Shabbat and eating a delicious meal 
all together.
Pittsburghs Shabbat 1000 is coordinated by 
Chabad House on Campus and the Hillel Jew
ish University Center of Pittsburgh. This years 
event is dedicated to the memory of the late 
mayor of Pittsburgh, Bob OConnor.
Dinner is free and open to everyone, Jewish 
and non-Jewish alike.
Today is th last day for students to sign up on 
the events website, www.shabbatl000.net. Par
ticipants can either sign up to host a table of 10 
people, or sign up as an individual to be placed 
at a table of 10 by the events organizers.
Shabbat 1000 will take place Friday, Febru
ary 9 at 5 p.m. in the Wiegand Gymnasium.

Company to release new software
LOGIC, from A1
think of [it] as something that 
you build stuff out of  its like 
steel, bricks.
According to Scherlis, depend
ability is key in many different 
fields. Software programs keep 
pacemakers working correctly, 
fly planes, drive cars, operate 
rockets, govern banking sys
tems, and have countless other 
responsibilities.
Even the average cell phone, 
an essential communication 
tool to many, contains three to 
five million lines of code. In all 
of this, there is enormous room 
for error.
The rate of errors per thou
sand lines of code is a rough 
measure, Scherlis said. The 
problem is that it takes just one 
little error to really do you in.
Unreliable software has been 
responsible for NASAs two failed 
Mars missions and the Northeast 
blackout of summer 2003.
Scherlis blames some of the 
problems in important soft
ware programs on the tension 
between computer scientists 
ambition and the level of tech
nological ability that currently 
exists worldwide.
As we got more ambitious 
about what we wanted to do with 
software, our ambition exceeds 
our ability to produce reliably, 
and so theres this tension of 
goals and means, Scherlis said.
Scherlis and his team took 
their completed research to sev
eral companies. Among them 
was Lockheed Martin, which 
was ' extremely enthusiastic 
about Carnegie Mellons soft
ware assurance tools.
The demand and enthusi
asm for the Fluid teams tools 
established that it was time for 
the researchers to market their 
technologies as commercial 
products.
The Company
In 2006, Sure Logic received 
investments from Innovation 
Works, the state of Pennsyl
vanias seed fund group that 
fosters economic development in 
southwestern Pennsylvania, and
the venture capital firm Saturn 
Capital. In addition, Carnegie 
Mellon has an equity stake in 
Sure Logic.
Sure Logic was founded in 
September 2006 under the lead
ership of CEO Steve Schmitt, 
a 1996 graduate of the Heinz 
School in public policy and in
formation technology.
Before coming to Sure Logic, 
Schmitt was the CIO of Pitts
burgh and the CEO of FORE 
Systems, a successful Carnegie 
Mellon telecommunications 
spin-off sold to Marconi.
Schmitt is particularly en
thusiastic about the software 
assurance industrys potential 
effect on southwestern Pennsyl
vanias economic development.
This is not about the com
pany or the technology, Schmitt 
said. I believe strongly that 
the research thats being done 
at CMU in the area of software 
assurance can really create an 
industry here in southwestern 
Pennsylvania.
Schmitt hopes that the teams 
research will put Pittsburgh on 
the map in the new but thriving 
industry of software assurance.
The work thats being done 
at the Institute for Software Re
search has the ability to create 
an international presence for 
software assurance, Schmitt 
said.
A brain drain, or exodus of 
qualified graduates, is a big fear 
in southwestern Pennsylvania, 
but Schmitt is proud of the fact 
that nine of the 10 people hired 
at Sure Logic hold degrees from 
Carnegie Mellon, eight of whom 
have either a masters degree or 
a Ph.D. from the university.
However, despite the compa
nys prominent position in the 
industry, Sure Logic still has to 
compete for top computer sci
ence grads with technology 
giant Google, according to Ed
win Chan, Sure Logics senior 
architect.
In addition, because the com
pany is only a start-up, a job at 
Sure Logic poses a significantly 
higher risk than an entry-level 
position at Google.
However, its a risk that Sure 
Logic software engineer and
Carnegie Mellon graduate Ethan 
Urie was willing to take.
Its a very small company at 
the moment, so you wear a lot 
of hats, Urie said, but its nice 
having such an impact on the 
company vision and where were 
going.
The Products
Sure Logics tools analyze 
only Java code, but the company 
plans to expand its software to 
include C, C++, and C# analysis 
tools.
According to Urie, Sure Logics 
tools find the most deeplyentrenched bugs that arent 
detected by testing and inspec
tion. Instead of just eyeballing 
thousands of lines of code and 
executing it in a number of dif
ferent situations, Sure Logic 
works by directly analyzing the 
code.
We analyze the software in 
a non-running state. We look at 
code as-is, Urie said. That al
lows us to find flaws that are very 
difficult to find using traditional 
static analysis.
Chan agreed that the dif
ference between Sure Logics 
product and those of other com
panies is significant.
Most other companies take 
your code, put it in a black box, 
and turn the crank, Chan said. 
He explained that Sure Logics 
tools require programmers to 
be much more involved in the 
process of analysis and policy 
implementation.
If you  have a policy, [our 
product] helps you write code 
that is consistent with that pol
icy, Chan said.
The list of companies that 
want Sure Logics technology 
reads like a whos who of the For
tune 500, including IBM, ebay, 
Oracle, and Sun Microsystems. 
Those who have had the chance 
to use the technology are enthu
siastic about its potential.
I cant think of any of our Java 
code I wouldnt want to run this 
tool on, said Andrew Winkler, 
senior architect at Lockheed 
Martin, at the International 
Conference on Software Mainte
nance held in September 2006.
Sure Logics new product will help companies create high-dependability software programs by analyzing each 
line of a programs coding. The companys office is pictured above.
Campus green practices need work
GREEN, from Al
To get one student to recycle 
a soda bottle instead of throw
ing it away is a triumph in itself, 
said Emmeline Altschul, presi
dent of Sustainable Earth and 
a senior chemistry major. The 
university itself is more sustain
able than its students.
Dining Services has made an 
effort to include healthier and 
more organic food on its menus. 
Additionally, it is trying to inte
grate more local foods from both 
suppliers and producers in the 
vicinity.
For the past several years, 
green building initiatives have 
been prominent among the uni
versitys initiatives.
Campus officials have intro
duced solar panels in campus 
buildings on Craig Street, and a 
green roof filled with vegetation 
on Hamerschlag Hall. The Intel
ligent Workplace, located on top 
of Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Hall, serves as a laboratory used 
to research environmental sus
tainability.
All new buildings on campus 
are now required to have LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Envi
ronmental Design) certification. 
New House was the first building 
to be LEED-certified, starting the 
trend in 2001, and the upcoming 
Gates Building will face the same 
requirements.
A LEED certification measures
building sustainability in five 
areas  sustainable sites, water 
efficiency, energy and atmo
sphere, materials and resources, 
and indoor environmental qual
ity. The certifications come in 
four levels  certified, silver, 
gold, and platinum. Currently, 
Carnegie Mellon requires a mini
mum level of silver.
Finding alternative sources 
of energy has been a consistent 
undertaking for students and 
researchers at the university. 
According to university data, 
approximately 15 percent of the 
universitys energy is produced 
by alternative electrical energy. 
That figure is expected to rise 
to 20 percent by the end of this 
year. Currently, university Presi
dent Jared Cohon is considering 
a petition brought to him by 
campus environmental organi
zations like Sustainable Earth 
that would require 51 percent of 
the universitys energy be pro
duced by alternative sources by 
next year.
Carnegie Mellon is a founding 
Green Power Partner and recipi
ent of the Clean Cities Award. 
The university also received the 
Green Power Leadership Award 
in 2001 for securing what was 
the largest single retail purchase 
of wind energy in the nation.
However, although Carnegie 
Mellon remains at the forefront 
of sustainability efforts on cam
pus, the universitys endowment
shareholder practices with re
spect to the environment lag far 
behind.
The study showed a clear trend 
between a schools endowment 
policies and its overall ranking 
on the surveys list.
The study estimated Carnegie 
Mellons endowment to be $940 
million as of the 2005-2006 aca
demic year. The four colleges 
and universities that received 
the highest overall grades in the 
study  Harvard University, 
Dartmouth University, Stanford 
University, and Williams College
 boast endowments that far ex
ceed Carnegie Mellons, ranging 
from $1.5 billion at Williams to 
$28.9 billion at Harvard. Due to 
their large endowments, these 
schools have more money to put 
toward sustainability without 
skimping in other areas. Right 
now, Carnegie Mellon simply 
does not have the funds to com
pete with these institutions.
It seems as if alumni simply 
do not donate here like they do 
at other schools, Altschul said. 
Maybe the obligation just isnt 
there for them.
The reason for the lack of 
alumni donations and a smaller 
endowment overall is unclear. 
However, despite green intiatives, since Carnegie Mellons 
endowment is so much smaller 
than other schools, the univer
sity may not move up in the sus
tainability rankings soon.
University to choose official mascot
MASCOT, from Al
on the issues. Frank defined a 
mascot as something collegiate, 
respectable, and representa
tive of athletics and academics. 
Colin Sternhell, a junior econom
ics major, described a mascot as 
good, fun, en
thusiastic, and 
supportive of its 
teams. Andrea 
Hamilton, stu
dent body vice 
president and 
a senior in art 
and ethics, his
tory, and public 
policy, wanted a mascot that 
would attract fans and as well as 
younger children.
What members of the audience 
didnt know was that the Scottish 
terrier or Scottie dog that is seen 
on apparel in the Carnegie Mel
lon bookstore is a clip art design 
that is not licensed and does not 
represent an official icon of Carn
egie Mellon, such as the official 
wordmark or official seal.
The old Scottie dog clip art has 
been grandfathered in, said Jay 
Marano, the universitys licens
ing coordinator and a member of 
the task force.
The task force held its first 
meeting last semester and has 
held four or five meetings to date.
Over the course of the year, the 
group has discussed the back
ground and history of mascots, 
the history of Carnegie Mellon 
icons, and the steps necessary 
to propose an official mascot 
that would best represent the 
interests of the Carnegie Mellon 
community. The task force has 
also sought the views of alumni.
The task, force is co-chaired by 
Church and Susan Bassett, Carnegie Mellons athletic director.
Since 2005, there have been 
several changes in Carnegie Mel
lons Athletics Department that 
have brought the issue of an offi
cial mascot to light, according to 
the task force. First, Bassett was 
named athletics director and has 
been working to
ward increased 
athletic recogni
tion. In addition, 
student athletes 
have been push
ing for an icon 
that could rep
resent Carnegie 
Mellon athletics, 
and the administration is open to 
supporting a formal proposal.
The task force will continue 
to hold meetings throughout 
the year to involve students, ad
ministrators, faculty, and staff 
in various capacities to create a 
mascot that would best represent 
the campus community.
The task force welcomes all 
suggestions and can be reached

Carnegie Mellon theorist creates test for string theory
by Jun Xian Leong
Junior Staffwriter
String theory has long been a subject of 
heated debate in particle physics because 
of its mostly unconfirmable predictions, 
which lead many experts to question its 
legitimacy. Now, in a controversial paper 
jointly published by researchers through
out the United States, scientists claim to 
have developed a test that may falsify the 
postulates of string theory and thereby
change our perceptions of the universe.
The paper, titled Falsifying Models of 
New Physics via WW Scattering and pub
lished in Physical Review Letters on January 
22, was co-authored by Jacques Distler 
from the University of Texas at Austin, 
Benjamin Grinstein from the University of 
California, San Diego, and Rafael A. Porto 
and Ira Rothstein, a graduate student and 
physics professor at Carnegie Mellon, re
spectively.
Every theory like string theory is based 
on certain mathematical assumptions,
and then what you can do is see what the 
consequences are of these assumptions, 
Rothstein said.
The greatest quandary in physics today 
is how different the laws of physics are 
between massive and subatomic scales. 
General relativity, which describes the in
teractions of large masses and gravity, has 
long been at odds with quantum mechan
ics, which describes physical interactions 
at the atomic and subatomic level. The the
ories differ wildly in their interpretation 
of reality, yet each of them is the most ac
curate representation of the world at their 
respective scales.
Gravitational laws, for instance, dictate 
that an orbiting mass must continually 
lose energy and eventually spiral into the 
center of orbit. Electrons orbiting around 
the nucleus, however, have a quantified 
minimum orbital that appears to violate 
all laws of energy conservation.
String theory is the most successful of 
various quantum field theories that have

Researchers in the chem
istry department, alongside 
colleagures in the Molecular and 
Biosensor and Imaging Center 
(MBIC), have just made the pro
cess of viewing and identifying 
DNA much easier.
MBIC conducted research to 
improve the process by which 
scientists identify and distin
guish different strands of DNA.

colleagues from MBIC, recently 
published an online paper enti

The MBIC, recently named the 
National Center for Networks 
and Pathways by the National 
Institutes of Health, is a center 
utilized by both Carnegie Mel

researchers, in addition to a
number of other universities. The 
MBIC has a history of research
ing and developing .fluorescent 
detection methods by combin
ing fluorescent probes, or areas 
of cells that produce color, with 
computerized microscopy.
Armitages recent paper out
lines a method for improving the 
process of fluorescent dyeing, 
which consists of binding fluo
rescent dye molecules to DNA. 
Color and concentration varia
tions allow for further levels of 
strand distinction.
According to Alan Waggoner 
of MBIC, The idea is to hook 
very bright fluorescent tags to 
things like DNA and proteins so 
that they can detect it. Scientists 
have used fluorescent detection 
methods in the past to uncover 
the human genome sequence, 
monitor AIDS, and diagnose can

Its hard to imagine life in North 
America without the influences 
of Europe and Asia. The Beatles, 
lasagna, lo mein  theres a lot to 
be grateful for.
But Europe and Asia have also 
brought thousands of species of 
invasive plants to North Amer
ica. Some European and Asian 
plants were brought to North 
America for aesthetic or medici
nal purposes, while others made 
it to the country after their seeds 
clung to the clothes and suitcases 
of travelers. While these plants 
are often beautiful and easy to 
maintain, they are also the most 
likely to pose major threats to the 
ecosystem.
Backyard Invasion, a new ex
hibit at the Carnegie Museum 
of Natural History, features 
images of invasive and endan
gered Pennsylvania plants. The
display  both informative and 
elegant  is a combination of 
drawings, paintings, etchings, 
and gicles (digital prints).
The illustrators obtained much 
of their information from the 
extensive library of records on 
Pennsylvania plants. If a plant 
is misfiled, it might be lost for a 
hundred years, explained Bon
nie Isaac, collection manager for 
the museums herbarium.
Non-native plants  also known 
as exotic plants  can be clas
sified as invasive when they 
exhibit rapid and aggressive 
growth. According to the Penn
sylvania Landscape and Nursery 
Association, Pennsylvania has 
approximately 3400 species of 
plants, 1300 of which are exotic.
Though some invasive plants 
are native to North America, the 
vast majority come from other 
continents, primarily Europe 
and Asia. When they take over 
a garden, park, or planting area, 
invasive plants endanger the surrounding ecosystem.
The invasive plants are likely 
to encroach upon regions previ
ously occupied by native plants, 
many of which are rare, if not at 
risk for extinction. By the year 
2000, an estimated five percent 
of plants native to Pennsylvania 
had been depleted. That same 
year, about one-fourth of those 
remaining were categorized as 
endangered.
Invasive plants flourish where 
other plants are likely to dwindle: 
on bare soil or disturbed ground. 
Exotic plants are known to thrive 
off the nitrogen in chemical fer
tilizer, so it is recommended that 
people fertilize their gardens 
with organic substances, such as 
compost and mulch.
One example of an attractive
 yet harmful  invasive plant 
is purple loosestrife (Lythrum 
salicaria). [The loosestrife] is

Palm oil may harm 
environment
Palm oil was touted as the 
fuel of the future by political 
and environmental groups just 
a couple of years ago. After re
cent scientific studies at palm 
plantations in Southeast Asia, 
however, environmental prob
lems with the palm oil initiative 
began surfacing.
Due to an increased demand 
for palm oil in Europe, many 
Southeast Asian rainforests have 
been cleared, and many farmers 
over-fertilize their harvests. In 
addition, many palm planta
tions are established on cleared 
peatland, which released enor
mous amounts of carbon into 
the atmosphere.
To clean up the situation, theNetherlands is leading an explo

Flies without sense 
of smell live longer
Maintaining a reasonable diet 
has always been a way to in
crease health and lifetime. Now, 
recent studies reveal that flies 
may actually live longer if they 
do not smell their food.
Flies use their sense of smell 
and food consumption levels 
to determine how nutritionally 
rich their environment is, and 
they then distribute their energy 
resources accordingly. Thus, if 
smelling of food is inhibited, the 
fly detects an artificial deficiency 
of nutrients and would direct 
more energy to vital functions 
and reproduction. This process, 
in turn, results in a longer lifes
pan.
To test this theory, scientists 
gave two groups of flies, one 
with functioning smell recep
tors and one with blocked smell 
receptors, the same diet. They 
found that the latter group lived 
40 to 50 percent longer than 
their normal counterparts.

How Things Work: Telescopes
Michael M. Whiston
Sometimes, the most distant objects 
are the most interesting to study. Tele
scopes allow scientists to discover and 
analyze star clusters, planets, and galax
ies beyond what the naked eye can see.
A telescope magnifies an image by 
collecting incoming light and bringing 
it into focus using a,mirror or lens. The 
telescopes eyepiece then spreads this 
light across the viewers retina, thus en
larging the image.
There are two types of telescopes: 
refractor telescopes and reflector tele
scopes. Refractor telescopes use a lens to 
bring light into focus, and reflector tele
scopes use mirrors.
Reflector telescopes are powerful 
enough to magnify deep-sky objects 
such as galaxies and nebulae. Refractor 
telescopes, on the other hand, can only 
be used to study stars and planets.
Some of the worlds larger telescopes 
are equipped with computerized instru
ments that enhance the viewers ability 
to analyze the structure of space ob
jects.
The South Africa Large Telescope 
(SALT), built in 2005, is equipped with 
an optical corrector assembly that helps 
detect objects in distant space. SALT 
is the largest optical telescope in the 
southern hemisphere. Carnegie Mellon 
University is one of many institutions 
that funded its construction.
Carnegie Mellon physics professor 
Richard Griffiths said, Basically, we 
build bigger and bigger telescopes all 
the time because we want to see fainter 
and fainter things.
Griffiths said that SALT is currently 
under commission but in the process of 
being tested. Once it is in use, its pri
mary purpose will be to take photos of 
objects in space and analyze light emit----------------------

ted by these objects using spectroscopy.
To take photos of objects in space, the 
telescope is equipped with the SALTICAM, a camera that also measures the 
intensity and absorption of light.
This telescope does, in fact, have 
the capability to measure polarization, 
Griffiths said.
SALT contains a number of subsys
tems as well. In particular, the telescope 
structure is capable of positioning and 
reporting the direction of the telescope 
direction within five arc-seconds, or 
5/3600 of a degree.
The primary mirror of the telescope 
further focuses light collected from the 
surrounding environment. The mirror, 
comprised of 91 smaller, interchange
able mirrors that are hexagonally 
shaped, can be tilted forward and back
ward using special controls.
Astronomers in Australia use 
a similarly designed microscope called 
the Anglo-Australian telescope. The 
telescope allows astronomers to view 
the center of the Milky Way galaxy and a 
collection of smaller galaxies called the 
Magellanic Clouds.
The telescope, 3.9 meters in diameter, 
uses charge coupled devices (CCDs), 
which convert light into digital signals to 
produce images of distant objects. These 
images are then stored onto a computer.
The Anglo-Australian telescope is 
equipped with spectrographs, or in
struments that divide incoming light
into spectrums of color. Scientists study 
these spectra to learn about the chemical 
composition and temperature of distant 
objects.
Scientists also use infrared devices 
to detect objects that do not emit vis
ible light, such as objects that are very 
cold or hidden by dust clouds. Different 
telescopes detect different frequencies 
of electromagnetic radiation. A radio 
telescope, for instance, detects radio sig
nals.
The Arecibo radio telescope, which 
is part of the National Astronomy and 
Ionosphere Center Arecibo Observatory 
in Puerto Rico, is equipped with a radio 
mirror 1000 feet in diameter and 167 
feet deep. This giant dish, coupled with 
a series of antennas and radio receivers, 
enables the telescope to detect weak ra
dio signals emitted by galaxies millions 
of years ago.
The Arecibo observatory is also home 
to a number of different research proj
ects, including atmospheric science and 
radar astronomy.
In fact, researchers recently used the 
Arecibo telescope, managed by Cornell 
University, to detect radio emissions 
from the Crab Nebula pulsar, which is a 
star that emits radio waves. According to 
a Cornell press release, the Crab Nebula 
pulsar is smaller than a soccer ball. Yet, 
this pulsar emits extremely strong radio 
waves in short time intervals  about 
four-tenths of a nanosecond.
This type of radio emission ha 
never been seen before, and research
ers suspect that it may be due to a third 
magnetic pole that is separate from the 
usual north and south poles.
As writer Timothy Ferris stated in 
his book The Big Shebang, We live in a 
changing universe, and few things are 
changing faster than our conception of 
it.

MUSEUM, from A4
our native species, said Cynthia Morton, 
associate curator and head of botany for the 
museum, and a professor of biology at both 
the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon.
According to a report by the Plant Conser
vation Alliance, purple loosestrife first made 
it to North America in the 19th century, when 
it was desired for medicinal and decorative 
purposes. Traced back to both Europe and 
Asia, loosestrife is still sought after for its 
looks, though it has been made illegal in Min
nesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois in an attempt 
to protect native plants.
Another more common example of an in
vasive plant is ivy. This is one all people 
can recognize, Morton said. It grows every
where.
English ivy (Hedera helix) has the ability to 
grow quickly and densely. When attached to 
a tree, the ivy will spread to cover increasing 
portions of its host, which will eventually die 
from lack of sunlight. Ivy can also cause dam
age to brick walls or other structures, as its 
tiny roots deteriorate the surface.
Able to adapt quickly to new environments 
and produce seeds in short cycles, invasive 
plants can be extremely hard to eliminate. 
Any removal effort is certain to cost money as 
well as time.
When the problem becomes sufficiently 
large, however, it is no longer practical to pull 
out invasive weeds by hand. At this point, it 
becomes the job of a professional to handle 
the situation, either through mechanical 
removal (digging or cutting) or chemical 
removal (herbicide). Frequently, one must up
root invasive plants for years in a row before 
they stop growing back. Still, Morton insists, 
its worth the effort.
Though many invasive plants made it to 
North America through accidental means, 
sometimes people go right out and buy them. 
Wal-Mart, K-Mart, and many local garden 
shops sell invasive plants to customers who 
probably dont know any better, Morton ex
plained.
If you cant control it, dont plant it, she
said. It takes work. The primary goal of 
Backyard Invasion is to educate visitors on 
the differences between invasive and endan
gered plants, and why it matters to protect the 
latter.
One endangered plant depicted in Back
yard Invasion is the Maryland meadow beauty 
(Rhexia maana). Theres only two rhexias 
in Pennsylvania, Morton said; one is endan
gered, and the other close.
Whats important is to replace invasive 
plants with native ones. If the ground re
mains bare, invasive plants are more likely to 
return. To choose a native plant that is sure 
to flourish, the Landscape and Nursery Asso
ciation recommends observing which species 
are present in neighboring areas.
For gardeners only interested in plants with 
exotic features, another option exists: culti
varse Cultivars are native plants developed for 
specific qualities, taking into account aesthet
ics, size, blooming-period, and the presence 
of thorns.
Cultivars can satisfy a consumers wants 
without harming the environment.

THEORY, from A4
attempted to reconcile these two 
interpretations of physical inter
action. String theory postulates 
that the fundamental form of 
matter is not particle-shaped, but 
rather, string-shaped.
The vibration of these strings 
in multiple dimensions deter
mines their, excitation mode, 
which is the type of elementary 
particle they represent, such as 
bosons, pions, and fermions. Su
persymmetry in string theory 
then relates the particles that 
transmit forces to the particles 
that make up matter.
Distler said that string theory 
is an effective field theory that 
describes physics in terms of de
grees of freedom on a particular 
energy scale. The experiment 
outlined in the paper attempts 
to determine the nature of the 
ultraviolet completion of string 
theory, which is how string the
ory should behave in high-energy 
situations.
If the values lie outside some 
range, it tells you something very 
profound about physics at the 
high-energy scales, namely that 
what were seeing is not of the 
expected sort, like string theory, 
Distler said.
The paper outlines a method of 
using the Large Hadron Collider 
(LHC) to detect the creation of a 
Jight Higgs boson during the scat
tering of W-bosons, from which 
the boundaries outlined by string 
theory can be tested. W-bosons, 
first detected at the European Or
ganization for Nuclear Research 
(CERN) in 1983, are elementary 
particles that control the weak 
nuclear force. Higgs bosons are 
theoretical particles that govern 
the difference between massive 
particles, such as bosons and pro
tons, and massless particles such 
as photons.
The LHC, which will be the 
largest particle accelerator in the 
world when it begins operation 
in Switzerland later this year, 
is hoped by many to be the first 
particle accelerator capable of 
detecting and analyzing Higgs 
bosons.
This paper is the first attempt to 
develop an experiment that may 
disprove string theory. Research
ers are mostly expecting to see 
the bounds set by string theory 
satisfied by this experiment.
Distler said that a success
ful outcome in the experiment, 
however, should not be seen as 
anything more than a weak sup
port for string theory. The results 
of the experiment can effectively 
rule out certain quantum field 
theories but not serve as verifica
tion.
Rothstein said, I highly 
doubt that the bounds would be
violated.... It seems highly un
likely. At the same time, Roth
stein thinks that it is important 
to test string theory. Everyone 
always comes down on string 
theory because we never know if 
it is right, he said, but one thing 
that you might know is whether it 
is wrong.
In the case that the results do. 
falsify string theory, there is no 
shortage of viable alternatives. 
Loop quantum gravity, for ex
ample, is an alternate quantum 
field theory that breaks Lorentz 
invariance, one of the core as
sumptions of string theory. Other 
more esoteric theories may come 
to the forefront as well.
According to Distler, however, 
we should not expect to see re
sults from the experiment for 
a few more years. However, re
searchers are very excited about 
the prospects of this experiment, 
regardless of the outcome. If we 
dont find the Higgs, a violation of 
our bounds will turn out to have 
a strong impact on our thinking, 
not just in high energy physics, 
and that would be just great, 
Porto stated.
I dont expect to see the 
bounds violated either, but if they 
are, well, thats how physics pro
gresses, Distler said.

Invasive plants may harm other garden plants
DNA, from A4
pies. Moreover, monitoring DNA 
activity of mutant and healthy 
cells is important for determin
ing the effectiveness of cancer 
treatments in individual patient 
cases. The population and activ
ity of cancerous and healthy cells 
within a tissue can help doctors 
determine whether recurrence 
is likely and further treatment is 
needed.
For example, two different 
populations of cells, one healthy 
and the other cancerous, could be 
distinguished based on labeling 
them with different color fluores
cent nanotags, Armitage said in 
the press release.
Graduate student Andrea 
Benvin, who is part of Armitages 
research group, stated in the 
press release, Our DNA nano
tags offer unprecedented den
sities of fluorescent dyes and, 
thus, the potential for extremely 
bright fluorescent labels.... Weve 
put it all into a very small pack
age, which will allow us to detect 
molecules with great sensitivity 
without interfering with the bio
logical processes we are trying to 
understand.
The structure of a fluorescent 
molecule is based on the design 
of phycobiliproteins, proteins 
found in certain types of pho
tosynthetic algae. According to 
the press release, the proteins 
contain multiple fluorescent pig
ments that absorb light energy 
and transfer it to chlorophyll 
before photosynthetic processes 
utilize the absorbed energy. The 
fluorescent DNA nanotags devel
oped by the MBIC team imitate 
this light-harvesting process to 
create very luminescent, fluores
cent labels.
According to Armitage, lightharvesting tags allow for further 
differentiation between different 
DNA strands. These light-harvest
ing dyes are excited by a certain 
wavelength of light and transfer 
energy to other light-emitting 
tags on the nanotags surface.
The interaction between tags and 
absorbed light causes the lightemitting and light-harvesting 
tags to fluoresce at different col
ors, accounting for the additional 
capacity to differentiate between 
strands.
The fluorescent molecules are 
inserted in between DNA bases, 
which are stacked on top of one 
another. Other dyeing methods 
usually have a single fluorescent 
marker for every strand of DNA, 
so this new method far exceeds 
previous levels of brightness. For 
example, if a strand of DNA con
sists of 30 bases, 15 markers can 
be attached to the molecule as 
opposed to one. This can create a 
level of fluorescence 15 times as 
bright as normal.
According to Armitages pub
lication, these assemblies of 
fluorescent molecules are advan
tageously simple. In particular, 
researchers used base pairing to 
assemble the DNAnanostructure, 
and the fluorescent molecules 
were then added to the solution
to form non-covalent bonds with 
the DNA.
In the press release, Armitage 
stated, The primary advantages 
of our system are the simplic
ity of its design combined with 
the ease with which the fluores
cence brightness and color can be 
tuned.
According to Waggoner, this 
process also makes detection 
more sensitive so that the mark
ers can contribute less volume 
to the structure. Furthermore, 
Waggoner said, Since you can 
use many different kinds of dyes 
... you could perhaps get multiple 
reagents of different color so that 
you could detect several different 
things at once.
Although this development 
marks an important advance 
in the field of DNA fluorescent 
marking, Armitage stated in the 
press release, We really feel that 
this is the tip of the iceberg and

Peduto looks out for student rights
Do you live off campus? Take a mo
ment and step out on the sidewalk. How 
many houses on your street would you 
call total disaster areas? If you live on 
Beeler Street or in the residential areas 
of Oakland, chances are that number is 
pretty high.
It would not be a stretch to say that 
for many students at Carnegie Mellon, 
Beeler Streets reputation precedes it. 
City Councilman Bill Peduto is aware 
of it too, and hes proposing reformed 
housing inspection legislation that 
would make it much harder for student 
housing landlords to ignore deteriorat
ing conditions on their properties.
The proposal would codify mandatory 
inspections of student-zoned property 
(e.g., the houses in Oakland and on 
Beeler that are rented to students). If 
the properties dont pass the inspection,
the owner will not be permitted to 
charge rent for someone to live there. 
The measures would not necessarily, 
change the criteria by which a property 
could fail inspection; instead, they are 
intended to make it easier for the city to 
actually enforce the current inspection 
laws.
Landlords arent happy, of course  
especially because the city may also gain 
the ability to get warrants to inspect a 
house based on neighbor complaints. 
Several local landlords are already 
intending to fight the legislation (ac
cording to an article in the January 26 
issue of the Post-Gazette), and it seems 
likely that others will follow suit.
While on the surface these new mea
sures from Peduto seem to be a great 
boon to students  new enforcement 
of a higher standard of living cant be
bad, right?  there are some issues that 
might complicate things. The biggest 
of these is that landlords might start 
cracking down on their tenants and 
requiring a higher level of upkeep of 
rented property, therefore shifting the 
onus of preparing for these inspections 
onto students. Another possibility is that 
landlords may just opt to increase rent to 
make up for the cost of keeping a closer 
eye on their property. As many students 
living off campus already know, rent in 
these areas is already bordering on ab
surdly high.
Peduto has made a habit of being con
cerned with students rights, and this 
legislation seems like a great idea with 
a few possible pitfalls. Now might be 
a good time to start making sure your 
house is up to snuff, and making your 
landlord do something about it if it isnt.
Fear the fabric
Despite the Scottie dog that may be 
stitched on your school sweatshirt and 
the furry, larger-than-life version of 
the canine that makes appearances at 
sporting events, Carnegie Mellon has no 
official mascot. Students and staff taking 
issue with our lack of a unifying symbol 
formed the Mascot Task Force and have 
been trying to create an official mascot 
for our university. In developing poten
tial candidates, the task force is taking 
into consideration factors such as the 
characteristics that the mascot should 
embody and whether or not it should 
embrace our Scottish tradition.
Instead, we would like to advocate 
maintaining our strong Carnegie Mellon 
tradition of being non-traditional. Since 
when has attending Carnegie Mellon 
ever been akin to the typical college
experience? Our classes are calibrated 
in units instead of the more typical 
credits. Our computer science majors 
take a class in which they are supposed 
to learn to socialize. Our most widely at
tended sporting event is not the Home
coming game, but crack-of-dawn buggy 
races in which we all gather to watch re
ally small people get shoved into strange 
vehicles and pushed up and down hills. 
And we are represented by tartan plaid 
instead of having an official mascot.
Most students embrace our unique
ness. We have a strange pride in the 
things that make our university different 
and, at times, ridiculous. We brag about 
it to our friends at other schools: Your 
universitys stadium may have a seating 
capacity upwards of 50,000, but we have 
a roboceptionist and get to whirl around
on carnival rides every spring. Loving 
the things that make us nerdy is a part 
of Carnegie Mellon culture.
Being without a mascot is just another 
way that Carnegie Mellon retains its 
pleasant distinctiveness. We certainly 
dont want to end up with a boring, ge
neric mascot like an eagle or a bear, nor 
do we want to be a mascot tragedy like 
the Wichita State University Shockers, 
represented by an anthropomorphic 
shock of wheat affectionately called 
WuShock. We prefer being the Carnegie 
Mellon Tartans. We are epitomized by 
our choice to be represented by a Scot
tish plaid. Fear the fabric.

Publicly funded research is public domain
As taxpayers, we have grown accus
tomed to blindly following the rules  
chipping in every year without giving a 
second thought about where that money 
is going, who its going to, or what its 
being used for. At the same time, we 
expect to have access to those things 
that we know lie within the bounds of 
the public domain  if a roads been 
repaved, we expect to be able to drive 
on it. If a new park has been built, we 
expect to be able to walk through it. 
However, taxpayers will probably never 
know how the governments share of 
their hard-earned paychecks will be 
allocated; most likely, its because the 
government presumes they dont care.
Every year, taxpayers of every ed
ucation level and economic status 
unknowingly contribute to the $55 bil
lion that the federal government spends 
annually to fund research, the results of 
which are only published in scholarly 
journals, according to the American 
Library Association (ALA). Because ac
cessing these journals requires a paid 
subscription, the journals are most likely 
viewed by a small subgroup of the aca
demic elite, who have both the interest 
and the money to read what are effec
tively the fruits of the publics labor.
Fortunately, Senator John Cornyn (RTexas) and Senator Joseph Lieberman 
(I-Conn.) understood the injustice of
the system and introduced a bill last 
year that would require federal agen
cies that spend more than $100 million 
a year on external research to make 
articles based on that research as avail
able to the public as roads or parks, via 
the Internet.
The bill, called the Federal Research 
Public Access Act, would be particularly 
advantageous to students, who are of
ten interested in research but unwilling 
to spend money on a scientific journal.
If the research is shared, its effects 
will reach and eventually improve the 
lives of a much wider audience than it 
would if it continued to be limited to 
such a narrow demographic.
The apathetic American left
Casey Taylor
I walked down to the CVS in Squirrel 
Hill for a pack of condoms the other 
day, sex-crazed and with a dry throat, 
and had a brief moment of dread and 
fear when the entrance was blocked 
by a group of middle-aged Christians 
holding dead-fetus banners. They 
never had a choice, the captions read, 
and at the bottom an image of Christ on 
the cross stared back at me. There was 
something oddly poetic about this group 
of mostly overweight women prancing 
around and shouting to no one in par
ticular. What especially struck me was 
the lack of bystanders gathered to hear 
their message. A stack of pamphlets sat 
on a table outside of the entrance un
touched. Nobody cared.
I got to thinking: When was the last 
time a protest made any noise? When 
was the last time a group of political 
activists did anything but make the 
top story of the evening news only to 
never be mentioned again? Americans 
have become the generation of the New 
Dumb: ignorant to the issues and with
out a care in the world. Where were you 
when the country stopped caring?
Im not just singling out the middleaged Jesus-freak crowd as ineffective. 
Actually, in todays America theyre 
fighting for the group thats constantly 
winning: the religious right. The liberal 
movement as a whole has completely 
lost its voice in modern America. There 
are no groups left in this country that 
command respect from the public as 
a whole, voicing their opinions loudly 
and refusing to back down for their
gay marriage rally by booking a local 
Unitarian Church minister to give his 
thoughts on the state of our country. 
Until these issues start to gain some 
true star power, some of the Martin 
Luther King-esque eloquence that so 
marked the civil rights movement of the 
1960s, it is unfair to expect the average 
American to give a damn about them.
Perhaps you disagree. Perhaps you 
think that Im selling Americans short 
and that the average American, even 
with all the celebrity gossip worship, 
reality television programming, and 
fast food consumption, still has time to 
learn all angles of an issue. Maybe you 
believe that the average American still 
has the ability to understand the com
plex nature of political issues facing 
this country, and that no excuse should 
be made for those citizens who ignore 
the problems facing their country; that 
these particular Americans should find 
inspiration in the issues themselves, as 
opposed to the leaders of each respec
tive movement inspiring them to get 
off the couch and make full use of their 
voice as members of a democracy.
. But can we really blame these people 
for needing a spectacle to draw their at
tention to the political sphere? Maybe 
this country has been spoiled with great 
leadership in the past. Maybe we had a 
few scattered decades of great leaders 
who could inspire a nation, and these 
few leaders should be the exception in
stead of the rule.
Regardless of what you believe re
garding those points, you cant argue 
with the fact that every high-schoolage student in America is in a history
Wheres the Malcom X of gay marriage? 
When is immigration going to find the 
leadership of a Cesar Chavez?
cause. It is the age of diplomacy in
stead of the age of action as it had once 
been in this country. Nobody wants 
to have a clear-cut message anymore. 
An excellent example is the lefts lack 
of a clear stance on abortion. Liberals 
are completely afraid of stepping on 
peoples toes or being offensive and 
are subsequently losing some part of 
their demographic. The fact is, Ameri
cans dont care about anything political 
anymore and  get this  its not their 
fault. Since the American Dream is to 
pass blame on somebody else, Im going 
to give America the proverbial freebie 
on this one.
We have reached an age in this coun
try in which no respectable public 
figures from the left are stepping up for 
the causes they believe are right. Sure, 
groups of people get together every 
now and then, marching through the 
streets until police officers arrive and 
break the scene up, but what liberal po
litical group in this country has a leader 
you can look at and directly associate 
with an issue? This isnt the 60s and 
70s anymore, which is completely evi
dent by the lack of memorable political 
figures outside of the official political 
arena. Wheres the Malcolm X of gay 
marriage? When is immigration going 
to find the leadership of a Cesar Chavez? 
Are any of the Iraq protest groups ever 
going to find a leader that rivals Abbie 
Hoffman?
Youre probably beginning to un
derstand what Im getting at. I dont 
blame Americans for lacking interest in 
American issues because, quite frankly, 
none of the issues have attracted any 
interesting figureheads yet. You cant 
attract thousands of supporters to a
classroom learning about Malcolm X, 
Bobby Seale, and Che Guevara and 
then heading home to watch the news 
and wonder why figures like that dont 
exist in modern-day society. And before 
kids get a chance to truly ponder this 
fact, they sit down in front of the televi
sion and get exposed to todays leaders: 
Ryan Seacrest, TomKat, and, of course, 
Brad and Angelina. Yes sir, nothing like 
dulling the senses and living the Ameri
can Dream to its fullest.
The true frustration comes from the 
average Americans inability to spot 
the lack of political direction. It seems 
as though after we began to right the 
(political) ship in the 60s and 70s, our 
good faith overtook our better judg
ment. We now live under the assump
tion that decisions made by our political 
leaders must, under any circumstance, 
be what are ultimately best for our na
tions future. Even if we disagree, as a 
whole we figure that voicing our opin
ion can make no major difference.
Without the leadership of a few in
spirational figures outside of the Con
gressional political arena, American 
liberals are doomed to wallow in their 
own self-pity for another few decades. 
On the other hand, theres always the 
possibility that one of these figures will 
break through in the near future, ral
lying Americans for or against any or 
all of the hot-button issues facing our 
disenfranchised nation. Have no fear, 
ladies and gentlemen, for when that 
day arrives and that leader takes center 
stage, youll recognize it. But you might 
not care.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 5, 2007
Barack Obama by any other name should smell just as sweet
Louisa Kinoshi
In 2000, when I initial
ly moved back to the United 
States after living in Nigeria, 
everyone knew me as Bukola. 
During school registration I 
was given the option of choos
ing which name to go by, and I 
chose Bukola, my middle name, 
because it is the name I had been 
referred to by family and friends 
all my life. I was very proud of my 
name because Olubukola means 
God has added to my wealth in 
Yoruba. Bukola is as popular in 
Yoruba towns as Ashley or Emily 
is in the United States. Bukola, 
however, did not run smooth
ly off the tongues of my high 
school classmates. They called 
me everything from Buquisha 
to Coca Cola.
The naming process in the 
Yoruba culture is extensive. My 
deceased grandfather meditated 
on the name Olubukola for eight 
days before I was officially given 
my name at a huge naming cer
emony. Because my name was so 
carefully chosen, I was upset that 
Olubukola had become subject to 
the insulting mispronounciation 
of my ignorant American friends. 
In college, I succumbed. I started
going by Louisa, my first name, 
not because I felt insecure about 
my middle name, but because
I wanted to protect the name 
Bukola.
It turns out that Im not 
the only one who has run into 
problems with my name and 
identity. In a speech on November 
9, 2006, Barack Obama spoke 
about the insecurities with his 
identity that he felt as a child. 
Because he came from such a 
humble background  his father 
was a goat farmer  he never 
thought that he would be able to 
become the household name that 
he is today.
Who would have ever 
thought the son of a woman from 
Kansas and father from Kenya 
with a name like Barack Obama 
would become a United States 
Senator? Obama said in his 
speech.
Obama is now exploring 
the possibility of competing for 
the Democratic candidacy for 
President. Unfortunately for 
Obama, his last name has been 
mistaken for and mispronounced 
as Osama, Snd his m'jddle name 
is Hussein. These names conjure 
up obvious images of Osama bin 
Laden and Saddam Hussein. The 
question remains whether pos
sible negative associations with 
Senator Obamas name will dra
matically affect his potential run
for the Presidential office.
The idea that ones name is 
directly linked to success is a 
myth. In the book Freakonomics: 
A Rogue Economist Explores 
the Hidden Side of Everything, 
Stephen D. Levitt and Stephen 
J. Dubner claim that the name of 
a child does not affect the future 
success of that child. The evi
dence in the book from California 
data showed that on average, a 
person with a distinctively black 
name like Imani or DeShawn does 
not have a worse life outcome 
that a woman named Molly or 
Jake. Instead, peoples economic 
circumstances or the education 
level of their parents are far bet
ter predictors of future sucfcess.
In Freakonomics, Levitt and 
Dubner tell the story of Robert 
Lane, a black father who named 
one of his sons Winner and the 
other Loser. Ironically, Loser went 
to prep school, graduated from 
Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, 
and joined the New York Police 
Department where he eventually 
made sergeant. Winner Lane, on 
the other hand, has a criminal 
record with nearly three dozen 
arrests for burglary and domestic 
violence, among other charges. 
These anecdotes invalidate the 
myth that ones name greatly 
influences that persons chances 
for success.
According to the Social
Security Administration, in 2005, 
the most popular baby girl name 
was Emily and the most popu
lar boy name was Jacob. These 
babies should not expect to be 
more successful than individuals 
named Bernethea or Burritt. As 
for Barack Obama, I dont think 
his name will be a huge issue 
during the 2008 elections. With 
issues like our failure in Iraq, the 
continued growth of terrorism, 
gay rights, and the after-effects 
of Hurricane Katrina, I hope that

United States citizens will be 
willing to look past something as 
trivial as a name and look more 
into the personality, leadership 
characteristics, and diplomacy 
skills of our next leader.

Molly Ivins voice left quite a mark
wu
O IVMarshall Roy
We would-be raconteurs, 
straight shooters, and cutters 
of the crap are mourning our 
sass-mouthed queen this week, 
our rabble-rouser-in-residence. 
Syndicated columnist and glee
ful turd in the political punch 
bowl Molly Ivins succumbed to 
breast cancer last Wednesday at 
the age of 62. She once joked 
that her writing was energized 
by truly impressive amounts of 
beer. In that vein, the next time
I crack open a cold one, Ill raise 
it to her.
If youre not familiar with 
Mollys work, heres what you 
need to know: She was feisty, 
she was a Texan, and she was 
chicken soup for the liberal soul. 
She hit the telling-it-like-it-is 
tone (which many writers aim 
for or are wrongly credited with) 
on the bulls eye. She made her 
readers think, laugh, and then 
think some more.
She once said that government 
(or, as she was fond of writing in 
her Texas vernacular, guvment) 
was the best form of free enter
tainment. She loved exposing all 
that was hypocritical and absurd 
in our nations leaders  which 
is to say, she had her work cut out 
for her in the 21st century.
She even had the stones to 
regularly refer to President Bush 
as Shrub, and her unofficial 
slogan was raise hell.
But if you want to talk about it 
in fancy words, what Molly had 
was a near-perfect ethos, which 
is the most mysterious and, I 
think, most important aspect of 
rhetoric. If you imagine a piece of 
persuasive writing as a little win
dow into a writers sensibilities, 
the ethos is what youd see if you 
peered inside. Its what Stephen
Colbert so brilliantly skewers in 
blowhards like Bill OReilly.
Mollys healthy disrespect 
for authority grew out of her 
relationship with her hard-line 
father. Her inability to suffer 
fools grew out of reporting on 
the Texas Legislature early in her 
career.
As a journalist, it was Mollys 
job to be direct, accessible, and 
concise. But she went one step 
further, employing a conver
sational tone that was at times 
humorous, but always straight
forward and persuasive. Her 
prose style was unique because it 
refused to align itself with what 
most readers expected from 
political criticism or commen
tary. And while unconventional, 
Mollys ethos was breathtakingly 
appropriate. Her refusal to speak 
the formalized language of poli
tics made her criticism not only 
memorable, but incisive as well. 
It created, and then worked in, 
its own context.
In her April 27, 2006 column,
flick is absurd  but thats the 
point. Ivins unique delivery 
embodied her mission to knock 
government off its pedestal and 
into the hands of the common 
people where she believed it 
belonged. She could have writ
ten, It is pointless for the gov
ernment to reclassify documents 
once they have been declassified, 
because people have already 
seen them and know what they 
contain. Thats clear and direct, 
too, but it lacks Ivins snarky 
irreverence. Its not nearly as 
memorable.
All right, I admit it: Part of the 
reason I love Molly Ivins writ
ing so much is that I agree with 
her. Im sure a reader of a differ
ent political persuasion would 
loathe in her what I love  he 
or she would find Ivins sarcasm 
snotty and obnoxious, her downhome tone condescending and 
disingenuous. But golly  Ive 
yet to find a conservative writer 
with so fine an ethos, with a 
sense of self so accurate and so
She was fiesty, she was a Texan, and she 
was chicken soup for the liberal soul.
she defended the privacy of late 
reporter Jack Anderson when 
the Bush administration wanted 
to seize the files hed kept dur
ing his decades as a journalist. 
The column also criticized the 
administrations extreme secre
cy. As Ivins settled into her argu
ment, her distinctive voice began 
to surface: Those who saw 
government documents between 
declassification and reclassifica
tion are just going to have to 
forget what they saw. That, or 
some Man in Black will be sent 
around to zap your memory with 
a little thingamajig.
Comparing government prac
tices to a fluffy science fiction
unshakable. Maybe I cant see 
the forest through the trees (for
est signifying my crippling bias 
and trees my unabashed liber
alism). Go figure.
In any case, do yourself a 
favor: Look her up and read a 
column or two. Whatever your 
political inclinations, youll love 
getting to know her. And when 
youre finished, I bet youll like 
her, or at least respect her, even 
if, on the off-chance that youre 
a humorless Rebiblican, you dis
agree with her.

Crocs are for the birds
Jessica Thurston
Id like to design a shoe. The 
shoe would be comfortable and 
relatively versatile  I want to 
be able to wear it in more than 
one place and to do more than 
one thing. Besides being func
tional, the shoe would be at least 
remotely attractive. Even if its 
best for a specific activity, the 
shoe wouldnt look like a fish out 
of water in everyday life.
Now, what shoe are you pictur
ing? What do these descriptions 
conjure up in the mind? Is it, say, 
the opposite of Crocs?
Crocs are chunky, rubbery, 
gaudy shoes. The best-selling 
version has massive, sweatreleasing holes. And with colors 
such as fuchsia, lime, and orange 
(coral) (which are actually not 
the same colors), these plas
tic platforms have no problem 
rivaling the most blinding colors 
rarely found in nature.
First of all, using an abbre
viated version of the name of 
a monstrous, murderous reptile 
does nothing but beg for doom. I 
would personally like to keep my 
feet firmly attached to my legs, 
rather than to lure crocodiles 
searching for their little brothers 
or sisters to come snipping at my 
ankles, thank you very much. 
Secondly, the most popular Croc 
is called the beach. Apparently 
not capitalizing a proper noun 
and referring to a warm, outdoorsy location makes a product 
seem really cool.
A handful of other Crocs 
shoes are called cayman, 
nile, islander, aspen, and 
athens. Again with the lack 
of proper capitalization. And, 
according to Crocs, Aspen (as 
in that place people go skiing) is
best represented in a shoe by a 
supple rubber material just like 
that of the beach minus the 
gaping holes. This way, snow 
has no way of touching your 
precious toes. But, um, your 
exposed heel protected only by 
a thin strap of plastic might get 
a little frostbitten out there on 
the slopes. Apparently the Nile 
River is also best traversed in 
sweat-inducing plastic material 
with a cutout for the toes.
According to the Crocs web
site, the shoes were created for 
boating and the outdoors. This 
seems reasonably plausible. 
While such colors as purple and 
bright yellow may not be totally 
appropriate for the laid-back 
nautical lifestyle, the general 
ideas of a supported foot base 
and holes from which water can 
escape are generally good ones. 
Also, rubber wont become sat
urated or stained like a regular 
canvas shoe, which is a plus for 
gardening or boating.
But what about for walking 
around campus? Unless you 
crawl to class on your hands 
and knees picking weeds from 
around the shrubbery, or take a 
sailboat across Forbes Avenue, 
plastic shoes with massive holes 
in them do not seem entirely 
ideal for the Pittsburgh envi
ronment. In fact, if youre not 
planning on going boating or 
doing some intense gardening, 
wearing shoes with huge holes 
around your toes (what Crocs 
calls a ventilated toe box
 hot) is almost embarrassing. 
The holes are just an attempt to

Perspectives
Feedback on 
mixed-gender 
housing needed
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
In college, we meet a lot of 
cool new people: friends from 
floors, classes, clubs, and social 
gatherings. These people end up 
being the cornerstone of our col
lege experience  the people we 
want to spend time with, share 
experiences with, and, more of
ten than not, live with. So why 
shouldnt we be able to live with 
our friends even if we arent the 
same gender?
Currently, Housings room as
signment process requires that 
pairing be made by gender. It 
doesnt matter how well you get 
along with a friend, you cant 
share a space with someone of 
the opposite gender. We think its 
time to change this.
Last semester we crafted a 
proposal to implement a pilot 
study to test whether or not stu
dents would be interested in 
mixed-gender apartment living. 
The pilot study calls for a one- to 
two-year period to study market 
demand, administrative needs, 
and residents concerns. The pi
lot study was designed to focus 
on the Small Oakland Houses 
(SOH) and would allow mixedgender cohabitation.
So how would this work? While 
its certainly not a simple change, 
it would still closely resemble 
the current room draw process. 
During room draw you would 
indicate a roommate assignment 
preference: male, female, or no 
preference. Your room would be 
filled accordingly. If Housing is 
unable to place someone accord
ing to your preferences, the room 
would default to Housings cur
rent same-gender standard. In 
other words, if our student com
munity does not want to take ad
vantage of the new housing op
tion, then housing options revert 
back to the status quo.
Because the pilot study would 
focus on self-contained, apartment-style living, Housing would 
be able to test the viability of 
mixed-gender housing without 
impacting students who arent 
interested in a mixed-gender en
vironment. All students would 
be able to try mixed-gender liv
ing except incoming first-years.
Weve observed that our peer 
institutions (like NYU, for exam
ple) have mixed-gender apart
ments, and weve introduced the 
idea to Student Senate, Student 
Dormitory Council, and relevant 
staff members. But we need stu
dent input! Is this something you 
want? The only way to get Hous
ing to move forward is to give 
them a better sense of students 
demands.
If you have any comments, pos
itive or negative, please e-mail 
sbp@andrew.cmu.edu ASAP. All 
student comments will be col
lected and referred to Housing. 
We can do this, but we need your 
support.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 5, 2007
SPORTS COMMENTARY
The flight of the Phoenix: Destination Dallas
Doug Fricker
Havent been following the 
National Basketball Association 
(NBA) this season? I dont blame 
you. The first three quarters of 
an NBA game matter about as 
much as what the second man 
on the moon said. Throwing all 
this aside, two NBA teams, the 
Phoenix Suns and the Dallas 
Mavericks, are winning at such 
an incredible rate that theyre 
getting a column written about 
them.
Dallas and Phoenix became 
just the third pair of teams in 
NBA history to enter February 
with an .800 winning percent
age. Dallas at 39-9 and Phoenix 
at 37-10 are pulverizing their 
opponents with little or no sign 
of letting up, and try this on for 
size, the Mavericks lost their 
first four games of the season 
while Phoenix lost four of their 
first five! Dallas is 25-2 since 
December 11. Phoenix is 34-4 
since November 18.
Dallas has separate win 
streaks of 12 games and 13 
games this season. Thats noth
ing, say the Suns, who have 
separate win streaks of 15 and
17 games on their resume this 
season.
The Phoenix Suns are such 
a powerful offensive team, the 
only teams that have been able 
to find success against them 
are Dallas and Utah. The Suns 
lead the league with an average 
of 111 points per game. With 
Steve Nash at point guard av
eraging 11.9 assists per game 
(hes leading the league; Utahs 
Deron Williams is way back in 
second, averaging nine) the 
Suns have that certain flair in 
their offense that can be mes
merizing to watch. Along with 
Nash, forwards Shawn Marion 
and Amare Stoudamire pour in 
the points and make the offense 
click. Add Leandro Barbosa, 
Raja Bell, and Boris Diaw (que 
sera sera et cest la vie; hes 
French) into the equation and 
you have six players who aver
age double figures.
The Suns are giving up de
fense in the process of having 
the best offense and theyre okay 
with that. Theyre 22nd in the 
NBA in points per game given 
up, whereas the Mavericks are 
second. The Mavericks are also 
eighth in the league in points 
per game showing theyre as 
balanced as a tight-rope walker. 
Theyve also got depth, playing
10 players a night compared to 
seven for the Suns.
Forward Dirk Nowitzki leads 
the team in scoring and is their 
lone All-Star. Josh Howard is a 
budding superstar while guards 
Jason Terry and Devin Harris 
are a solid backcourt combina
tion. Jerry Stackhouse provides 
a scoring punch off the bench. 
Dallas depth and Phoenixs 
lack thereof will loom large in 
the second half of the season, 
with the Suns running the risk 
of running out of gas when it 
matters most, around playoff 
time.
As Dallas and Phoenix keep 
racking up wins, making their 
opponents look like blindfolded 
kids trying to hit a piata, the 
stage is being set up for the 
playoffs.
With the Eastern Conference 
lacking the firepower found in 
the Western Conference, forget 
about the NBA Finals. Phoenix 
is 10-0 on the road and 19-1 
overall against Eastern Confer
ence teams.
Its hard to fathom a team 
from the East winning four of 
seven after seeing a stat like 
that. The real series to watch 
will be the Western Conference 
Finals, when the two best teams 
in the NBA battle it out just to 
determine who makes it to the 
NBA Finals.
Womens basketball falls on the road
WOMEN, from A10
ing 17 points to the Tartans 14 
and ending the game. The Spar
tans hit 46.4 percent of their 
shots as Carnegie Mellon made 
just 37 percent. Case players Ma
ria Jackson and Ashley Horton 
were instrumental in the Spartan 
win, scoring 26 and 14 points, re
spectively.
Two days later on Sunday, the 
Emory Eagles (8-12, 2-7) saw 
success on their home court, de
feating Carnegie Mellon by 22 
points.
The Tartans came out strong, 
beginning the game with a 6-0 
run. The lead switched hands 
throughout the first half, but
the Tartans headed into the sec
ond half trailing by one (27-26). 
First-year guard Paige William
son led the Tartans offense with
11 points in the first half.
Carnegie Mellon scored nine 
points at the beginning of the 
third quarter, putting them ahead 
before Emory took the lead for 
good with 15 minutes left in the 
game.
The Eagles hit 47.3 percent of 
their shots while Carnegie Mel
lon made a meager 31.3 percent. 
We just couldnt hit anything, 
it seemed, senior guard Nora 
Darcher said. There just isnt 
anything you can do when you 
dont hit your shots. It was frus
trating, but we kept trying.
Williamson led the Tartans 
scoring with 14 points. Senior 
point guard Ashley Mazziotta 
was next with eight points and 
five rebounds.
We tried a new defense and 
it worked really well, but we just 
couldnt convert on the offensive 
end, Darcher said. Once we 
start hitting out shots, we will be 
fine. We just need to keep work
ing on that.
The Tartans (8-12, 2-7) con
tinue their road trip this week, 
traveling to Boston and New York 
City to play Brandeis University 
and New York University in two 
UAA matchups. The team lost to 
both NYU and Brandeis overwin
ter break.
Mens basketball wins one, loses one
MEN, from A10
held on for the 11-point vic
tory.
Emory shot 52 percent for 
the game compared to the Tar
tans 40 percent. Kozak led the 
way for Carnegie Mellon with
18 points as five players scored 
in double figures. Anderson 
and ORourke each scored
14 points, senior guard Brad 
Matta chipped in 11, and soph
omore center Rob Pearson had
10 points and eight rebounds. 
Sophomore forward Ryan 
Einwag led the team with 11 
rebounds in the loss.
[Emory] got an early lead 
on us and I know Ive said it 
before, but you just cant fall 
behind on the road in the 
UAA, Matta said. We were 
down 17 at one point and we 
got it down to nine. Then, they 
just hit shots the same way we 
did against Case, only at that 
point we were down nine in
stead of up by nine.The mens basketball team is 5-4 in the UAA with five UAA games!IIVI

THE TARTANFebruary 2007
Mens basketball team battles Case and Emory
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team split a pair of 
road University Athletic Asso
ciation games this past weekend 
against Case Western Reserve 
University and Emory University. 
The Tartans edged Case 70-68 on 
Friday night before falling 94-83 
to Emory Sunday afternoon.
On Friday, the host Spartans
Carnegie Mellon mens basketball tangled with Case and Emory this past weekend, defeating the Spartans 70-68 but falling to the Eagles 94-83.
held a two-point advantage with 
37 seconds left before sophomore 
guard Corey ORourke tied the 
game on a layup with 30 seconds 
remaining. A Case free throw 
gave the Spartans a 68-67 lead 
before junior guard Geoff Kozak 
hit the game-winning threepointer with only 9.7 seconds left 
to give the Tartans the 70-68 
win. A last-second shot by Case 
was off the mark, giving Kozak 
his second game-winner in the 
past three games.
Case Western built a quick 
11-2 lead to start the game, but 
the Tartans answered with a 
21-12 run of their own to tie 
the game at 23 at the 8:22 mark, 
thanks to a tip-in by first-year for
ward Dan Sawl. The Tartans then 
took their first lead of the game 
on a driving layup by ORourke 
and headed into halftime leading 
32-27.
A19-7 run to begin the second 
half from Case saw the Tartans 
down 46-39, but Carnegie Mel
lon again had an answer, scoring 
eight straight points to retake 
the lead with 13 minutes to play. 
From this point forward, neither 
team led by more than three 
points.
ORourke led the Tartans with 
15 points and sophomore for
ward Dan Martin (starting for 
the first time) added a careerhigh 12 points. First-year guard 
Jack Anderson hit a pair of threepointers en route to 10 points and 
a team-high seven rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon shot 40 
percent from the field, but a dis
appointing 42 percent from the 
free-throw line, making 13 of 
31 attempts. Fortunately, Case 
Western was equally bad, mak
ing just 18 of 40 attempts from 
the charity stripe.
This game was back and 
forth, senior guard Brad Matta 
said. Case made their runs at the 
beginning of both halves, but we 
overcame adversity and we made 
plays when we needed to. Geoff 
hit the huge game-winning three, 
we pulled down a rebound when 
we needed a rebound, and made 
a shot when we needed a basket. 
When it came down to the wire, 
we were ready to make plays. We 
have guys on this team who have 
been in these situations before.
The Tartans never held the 
lead against Emory on Sunday, 
with the Eagles using a 29-10 
run to create a resounding 36-16 
lead with 7:35 remaining in the 
first half. Carnegie Mellon trailed 
53-36 at halftime with field goal 
shooting telling the story. Emory 
shot 55 percent from the floor 
whereas the Tartans came into 
the locker room shooting 33 per
cent. The Tartans made things 
interesting in the second half, go
ing on a 13-2 run to narrow the 
gap to 64-56 with 10:42 remain
ing after Anderson connected on 
a layup. The Tartans would get 
no closer, however, as the Eagles

Womens basketball 
team loses to UAA foes
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
After defeating Case Western 
Reserve University and Emory 
University two weeks ago at 
home, Carnegie Mellons wom
ens basketball team traveled to 
play these University Athletic 
Association (UAA) foes on their 
home courts last weekend. The 
Tartans came up short, losing to 
Case 76-59 and Emory 77-55.
On Friday in Cleveland, the 
Tartans were unable to maintain 
their two-game winning streak 
as Case (9-10, 1-7) defeated 
Carnegie Mellon.
Junior guard Leah Feola 
opened the game with a layup 
in the second minute of play, but 
it was the last time the Tartans 
would hold a point advantage 
throughout the game. Feola 
scored 20 points dutjng the
game, a personal season-high.
The Spartans gained momen
tum early, building a 15-point

Last Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon track and field teams 
traveled to West Virginia to 
compete at the State Farm Shell 
games. The mens team had 
three individual first-place fin
ishes while the womens team 
performed solidly as well. Some 
of the competition included Di
vision I schools such as West 
Virginia University and Division
II schools such as Indiana Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and West 
Virginia Wesleyan College.
On the mens side, sophomore 
Brian Harvey broke a school re
cord by finishing first in the one 
mile with a time of 4:18.05. Se
nior Geoff Misek (4:32.47) and 
sophomore Mike Haley (4:38.23) 
finished fifth and seventh, re
spectively.
Breaking the record is 
definitely a nice indicator of my 
current fitness level and helps 
build my confidence for the rest 
of the season, Harvey said.
Sophomore sprinter Carlton 
Reeves also had a terrific day, 
finishing first in the 400-meter 
dash with a time of 53.07. Senior 
Russel Verbosky finished sixth 
with a time of 23.55 in the 200-
meter dash.
In the 500-meter run, first-year 
Chris Bogie led the team with a 
fourth-place finish with a time 
of 1:09.74. Junior Kiley Williams 
(1:09.91) and senior Jeff Polack 
(1:14.55) finished right behind 
Bogie in fifth and seventh place, 
respectively.
Senior Davey Quinn finished 
second in the 800-meter dash 
with a time of 1:58.63. First-year 
Dan Burrows (2:03.73) and se
nior Kevin Pruzinsky (2:05.69) 
finished sixth and eighth, re
spectively.
In the 1000-meter run, ju
nior Drew Miller (2:37.99) and 
sophomore Raphael Bertrand 
(2:44.51) led the team with 
second- and fourth-place fin
ishes. Sophomores Breck Fresen 
(9:05.12) and Andrew Frederickson (9:13.16) came in seventh 
and tenth in the 3000-meter run, 
respectively.
Senior Nicholas Bannister fin
ished the 60-meter hurdles with 
a time of 8.53. Sophomore Craig 
Hahn followed to finish fifth with 
a time of 9.21.
In the high jump, sophomore 
Colin Marks finished fifth with a 
1.78-meter jump and senior Eric 
Tang placed eighth with a jump 
of 1.65 meters. Tang also finished 
third in the long jump (6.74 me
ters) and third in the triple jump 
(13.14 meters). Sophomore Joel 
Palko (12.68 meters) and firstyear Eric Couphos (12.54 meters) 
grabbed fourth- and sixth-place 
finishes, respectively.
Im fairly satisfied with my 
performance in the long and 
triple jump although I could have 
done a little better, Tang said. I 
kneed myself in the face and got 
a pretty bad nose bleed during 
high jump. That was very unfor
tunate.
First-year Chris Bridgeman 
vaulted 3.80 meters to finish 
sixth. First-year James Hulley 
threw for 13.19 meters in the 
shotput for sixth place while ju
nior Mike Reggie threw for 14.84 
meters in the weight throw for 
sixth place as well. The mens 
4x400-meter relay A team 
finished third behind the West 
Virginia relay teams with a time 
of 3:32.56.
For the womens team, sopho
more Ashley Bakelmun had a 
strong race finishing fifth in the 
800-meter run with a time of 
2:30.55. Senior Jerri Castillo 
(2:34.25) and first-year Danielle 
Sedlack followed with eight- and 
ninth-place finishes, respec
tively.
In the 1000-meter run, firstyear Anna Lenhart finished
fourth with a time of 3:24.52.
Four Carnegie Mellon 400- 
meter runners finished in the 
top ten; first-year Diane Mat
tingly finished third with a time 
of 1:03.47, and junior Shauna 
Ormon (1:30.54), senior Jackie 
Andreozzi (1:04.77), and junior 
Kelly Mingle (1:06.78) finished 
fourth, sixth, and ninth, respec
tively.
Like the mens team, the wom
ens 4x400 meter relay A team 
finished in third place behind the 
West Virginia teams. Im excited 
for our 4x400 in the upcoming 
UAA meet because I feel we have 
four really strong 400 runners, 
Andreozzi said.
Sophomore Jessica Meng
placed seventh in the long jump, 
triple jump, and high jump. She 
jumped 4.63 meters in the long 
jump, 10.21 meters in the triple 
jump, and 1.53 meters in the 
high jump.
Were starting to come to
gether, head coach Dario 
Donatelli said. The next two 
meets, the competition will get 
much better. Itll get us ready for 
UAA, which is what were trying 
to accomplish.
The track and field teams will 
take to the road once again on 
Saturday to compete at Bucknell 
University.
letic Association (UAA) games, 
with at-home wins against 
Emory University and Case 
Western Reserve University. 
During this streak, junior guard 
Leah Feola had some of her top 
career performances. She was 
also named the Eastern College 
Athletic Conference co-player 
of the week. This week, the Tar
tan sat down with Feola to talk 
about her success on the court.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing basketball?
Feola: Well, Ive always been 
athletic and really liked sports, 
so I started playing in third 
grade, basically because it was 
the only sport available.
T: Did you plan on playing 
even when you got to college?
F: Definitely. I also played 
volleyball in high school, but 
I really wanted to play basket
ball. It was actually part of my 
decision when I was choosing 
schools.
T: So the team was part of 
your decision to come to Carn
egie Mellon?
F: I definitely wanted to play
basketball, and my older brother 
was also an athlete at Carnegie 
Mellon, and he really liked it. I 
didnt come on a recruiting trip 
or anything, but I really like the 
idea of getting to be on a com
petitive team and going to one 
of the top academic schools in 
the country.
T: Any accomplishments you 
are particularly proud of?
F: Winning the two UAA 
games [this year] is a big 
accomplishment. UAA play is 
really competitive, and theyre 
hard teams to beat, so winning 
two of three is exciting.
Also, I have had three 
double-double games, which 
is double-digit points and re
bounds, so thats something Im 
kind of proud of.
T: How do you manage to 
balance your time with basket
ball and your academic course 
load?
F: Planning a schedule and 
staying on top of things is really 
key. It can be a little bit of a chal
lenge sometimes, but really, if I 
keep track of everything and 
dont fall behind in work and 
f
reading, it isnt too bad.
T: Do you have any place in 
particular that youve gotten to 
travel to for basketball thats a 
favorite?
F: Its so nice that we get to 
travel so much. Playing alone 
is amazing, and then that extra 
experience of getting to travel 
to so many cities every year is 
incredible. Chicago is probably 
my favorite, but Boston and St. 
Louis are really nice, too. Plus, 
next year, were planning to go 
to a tournament right before 
Christmas in Cancn! So that 
should be a great trip; and then, 
its not for basketball, but Im go
ing to Ireland for spring break, 
so Im really excited about that.
T: What are your favorite 
things to do to relax when you 
have the extra time?
F: Well, hanging out with my 
friends, sleeping, just watching 
TV, things like that that every
one does, and shopping. I love 
shopping, especially jewelry, 
thats really my weakness. I 
definitely raided the Tri-Delta 
jewelry sale last week; I loved 
that.

Visiting graduate inspires student writers
Everything you need to know
About getting some, and getting some sleep 
Dear Janet, Dear Janet,
Carnegie Mellon offers its creative writing 
students an extensive education, with classes 
in subjects as diverse as nonfiction and 
screenwriting, many of which are taught by 
published authors. But the outside world is not 
paved with story workshops and poetry readings. 
Thus the question remains: What is a creative 
writing major supposed to do after college? Sue 
Stauffacher, a childrens author and graduate 
of Carnegie Mellon's creative writing program, 
came to speak in the Adamson Wing of Baker 
Hall last Wednesday, proving that her major is not 
without hope  or the possibility of success.
Jim Daniels, a professor in the English 
Department, is amazed at how Stauffacher 
continues to have a great energy, vitality, and 
passion... [she is] living and experiencing life to 
its fullest. While introducing Stauffacher, Daniels 
complimented her personal life as well as her 
writing. "[She and her husband] hold the record 
for longest lasting marriage of our department, 
he said. Maybe this too inspired hope in the 
student audience; Stauffacher met her husband 
Roger Gilles in a class at Carnegie Mellon.
Specifically, it was a creative writing workshop. 
While reading a piece about the negative aspects 
of men, Stauffacher found herself agreeing the 
whole way through. Surprisingly, the author was 
male. Stauffacher fell in love with his writing 
but worried, as she admitted in her speech, I 
hope he doesnt look like a troll. To her relief, 
Stauffacher continued, He was normal-looking. 
Gilles was the best thing that ever happened to 
her writing, Stauffacher explained. She advised 
aspiring writers to make sure your partners 
understand the importance of writing.
During Stauffachers Carnegie Mellon years, she 
resided in Greenfield. Her daily commute took 
her past Squirrel Hill, where she regarded the 
lit-up homes with envy. She had no conception 
of the later success which would bring her into 
a similar position. When I was your age I didnt 
think I would write for children, Stauffacher 
said. It started calling me. She chose children 
because her humorous style is suited to that 
age group, though she admits that children 
are a difficult audience to please. Children are

Stauffacher spoke last Wednesday 
night in the Adamson Wing of 
Baker Hall. Stauffacher created 
Franklin Delano Donuthead, 
among other children's characters.
the hardest... they know when they are being 
patronized, they know when things aren't right, 
said Stauffacher.
Although she has written magazine articles 
and book reviews in addition tp teaching at 
universities, Stauffacher eventually found 
success in the field of childrens literature. Her 
most fruitful books have been her stories about 
Franklin Delano Donuthead, a semi-neurotic 
middle-school boy who is trying to take life one 
step at a time. Stauffacher included a quote 
by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Donutheads 
namesake, in the preface to the book: When you 
get to the end of the rope, tie a knot and hang 
on. Another hit novel was Harry Sue, about a 
child whose parents are convicts. Life calls for 
the protagonist to have a heart of steel, but she 
falls short and instead has a caring heart.
During her talk, Stauffacher read excerpts from 
Donutheart, Harry Sue, and one of her current 
works in progress. Then, she quoted Viktor 
Frankl in his book Man's Search for Meaning: 
"Success like happiness cannot be pursued, it 
must ensue.... In the long run ... success will 
follow you precisely because you had forgotten to 
think of it. She lives her life by these guidelines, 
she explained, and understands that artists 
cannot waste time searching for fame; they will 
be found. According to Stauffacher, appreciation 
for the art of literature is waning, which may 
prove a problem for future writers.
Since 1992, Stauffacher has been working 
on novels for middle-grade readers. Her work 
entertains children, but uses a sophisticated 
tone, making references to history and medicine. 
"I saw my daughter devour Donutheart in a day, 
Daniels said.
Stauffacher has achieved success not only in her 
life, but also in her ability to satisfy a difficult 
audience. That should give creative writing 
majors a little more hope.

This is a little embarrassing, but 
Im pretty inexperienced sexually. 
Ever since Ive come to [Carnegie 
Mellon] Ive tried to find someone 
to hook up with, but it seems like 
I never have any luck. Im a nice 
guy, I try to listen to what girls say 
and be nice to them, but nobody 
ever wants to take it to the next 
level. What am I doing wrong?
Not Ever Really Dated
Dear NERD,
The dating scene at Carnegie 
Mellon can be hard, no doubt: 
Were a very boy- and nerdcentric school. Competition can 
be fierce, so before hitting up 
a prospective date I would first 
consider how realistic your goal 
is. Once you think shes in your 
league, make sure you dont 
go too fast. Nothing is a bigger 
turnoff than somebody laying it 
on too thick. Still, you cant wait 
too long to give some sign of how 
you feel or you risk being forever 
considered as a friend. If youre 
just looking for sex, your best 
bet is probably either drunken 
parties or the Internet. But if you 
are looking for someone to date, 
just take a look at the girls around 
you, be obvious but not creepy 
about how you feel, and be willing 
to accept it if your overtures are 
rejected. Good luck!
Janet
Did you know?
I cant seem to get any sleep. 
Every night I go to bed and wake 
up a few hours later. Ive tried 
staying up later to make myself 
tired, but It hasnt helped.... What 
should I do?
Student Needs Overnight Rest, 
Easier!
Dear SNORE,
The typical advice-column spiel 
is to not drink caffeine or exercise 
after 4; dont work or watch TV in 
your bedroom; have a stable sleep 
schedule, etc. Now, lets get to 
the real advice. Ease yourself into 
sleep  dont go straight from 
something active right into bed. 
If noise keeps you awake, get 
an air purifier or humidifier to 
make white noise, or a fan in the 
summer. Dont focus on all the 
crap you have to do tomorrow. 
Just focus on breathing slowly 
and relaxing your muscles; I like 
to count my breaths, but as long 
as you concentrate on something, 
itll work. Finally, the worst thing 
you can do is to lie there stressing 
about how little sleep youre 
getting, its better to turn the light 
on and read something boring for 
class than to lay in the dark with 
your eyes wide open for hours.

Dionysians do it better
At Mr. Smalls, Galactic goes Greek
Its pretty amazing that the Greeks could coin a term 
thousands of years ago that so aptly describes an exciting 
show like Galactic's. Performing last Wednesday at Mr. 
Small's Theatre, the band demonstrated what we might call 
Dionysian revelry.
Though we share dance as a common link to our ancient 
friends, one advantage we do have over the Greeks is 
electricity. We carry on their traditions of song, dance, 
and communal drinking, but they could not have even 
dreamed of their lyre becoming an electric guitar or their 
flute transforming into a baritone saxophone. Furthermore, 
because we have electricity, we can synchronize our lights 
with the rhythms of the songs, and we have total control 
over the shapes and colors they produce. Instead of dancing 
around the fire and singing together, we cheer before the 
electric glow of the performers onstage.
Before Galactic took the stage, opening performer Papa Mali 
advised the crowd in song to "Drink a little beer/ drink a little 
wine/ Smoke a little kind/ Gotta keep you happy."
Papa Malis lines apply directly to the show, the venue, the 
audience, and possibly even the performers themselves. Mr. 
Small's Theatre is a place where the beer flows like wine and 
smoke fills the air. Not surprising, the show was restricted to
those 21 and older. You have to be of age to get in, but once 
youre in, its reveky at its finest.
Besides the strong liquors, the music also proved a factor for 
intoxication. Galactic is a powerful group, and its members 
play together with precision. Each instrument adds a new 
level of intensity to the final product, and when they add the 
saxophone, the melody is driven by the ensemble. Center 
stage Ben Ellman sings through his horns.
The leader of a rock and roll band must either play the guitar 
or sing or do both, right? Well, not if the band is Galactic. 
There are a number of reasons why this band defies most 
conventional rock and roll wisdom.
First of all, the bands singer, Theryl DeClouet, left two years 
ago. Galactic has since continued as an instrumental quintet. 
None of the band members  not keyboardist Rich Vogel, 
drummer Stanton Moore, or bassist Robert Mercurio  sing 
in this band. Guitarist Jeff Raines also doesnt sing, and he 
stands to the side when he plays. Ellman doesnt sing or play 
guitar, but rather plays saxophones and harmonicas.
All of this shouldn't seem too strange. After all, a lot of bands 
have been led by instrument players. John Coltrane had a 
few bands of his own. Playing the trumpet, Miles Davis also
led a few. Herbie Hancock, Thelonius Monk, and Count Basie 
are some of the greatest bandleaders in history, and they all 
played the piano. Herbie Mann even led some while playing 
the flute.
When faced with New Orleans jazz-inspired funk rock, 
uncontrolled convulsions are inevitable. One young lady at the 
show was dancing so wildly that she kept hitting people in 
the face as they walked by; it seemed to be a typical reaction 
to the music.
Dionysian revelry such as Wednesday nights has a few 
obvious benefits for society. Besides reconnecting those 
present with the natural forces of the Earth, it may also lead to 
procreation of the species. Hot chick bassist Cass Ferguson, 
who plays with Papa Mali, demonstrated this effect when she 
joined Galactic onstage  pounding out hardcore bass lines 
and gyrating sexily. She captivated the audience, and may 
have indirectly encouraged the use of the free condoms that 
were distributed.

Carnegie Hall hosts Artemis Quartet jf|Paperhouse
Schoenberg vindicated, Brahms rediscovered iittAlMlon Bioodymindeds Costa radio station.
Last Monday night at Carnegie Hall, the young Berlinbased Artemis Quartet performed Brahms' "String 
Quartet No. 3" and Schoenberg's Quartet in d minor. 
The Artemis Quartet gave Brahms third quartet an 
opportunity to step out of the shadow of the composers 
earlier two quartets and shine. The Artemis Quartet's 
luminous, intelligent, and expressive performance 
vindicated the Schoenberg work, Quartet in d minor," 
which early audiences had scorned, as a masterpiece 
that is both complex and emotional.
Brahms third and final quartet is often overshadowed 
by his earlier, more serious quartets. The third quartet is 
a lighter work. Eckart Runge, the cellist of the Artemis 
Quartet, described the quartet as having "a spring-like 
quality that [the collection of] other Brahms [quartets] 
doesn't have.
The third and fourth movements of Brahms quartet are 
fine examples of counterpoint, the interplay and equality 
of the four independent instruments, which is a major 
element of quartet writing. The different instruments 
trade the melody, giving it a different character, an 
emotional inflection, and a sense of journey. The 
Artemis Quartet excelled in characterizing Brahms' 
melodies, which were by turns wistful, joyful, serious, 
and light-hearted. The Artemis Quartet's performance 
of the quartet amounted to masterful story-telling in 
music.
During a pre-concert discussion, Artemis Quartet violist 
Volker Jacobsen addressed the risks of programming 
the music of Schoenberg. As you know, he said, 
Schoenberg is still a dangerous name." Though 
Jacobsen admitted that audiences are usually a little 
smaller when the Artemis Quartet plays Schoenberg, 
the groups searing and virtuosic.performance of his first 
quartet more than justified its selection.
Schoenberg's String Quartet in d minor" had a 
disastrous premier in 1907. In 1937, Schoenberg 
wrote that he "was primarily regarded as the Satan 
of modernistic music" after its debut. However, the 
Artemis Quartet's performance showed the quartet to 
be a terse, concentrated work that is very complex but 
full of roiling, powerful emotion.
Schoenberg composed the first string quartet when he 
was still writing music in the vein of Richard Wagner,- 
known for his grandiose operas; among them, Tristan 
and Isolde. This was before Schoenberg adopted the 
12-tone system and abandoned tonality altogether. In 
choosing to program Brahms and Schoenberg in the 
same concert, the Artemis Quartet hoped to bridge 
the gap between the romanticism of Brahms and the 
late-romanticism of Schoenberg and demonstrate 
that the two composers had a lot in common. In fact, 
Schoenberg idolized Brahms.
Schoenberg's quartet, however, is so chromatic and 
the counterpoint so dense that it stretches tonality to 
the breaking point, .creating music that is very tense 
and complex. The ending of the piece (which is around 
45 minutes in duration) is magical: The music finally 
cadences, or feels like it comes to a resting point or 
conclusion. The leading tone and the resolution occur 
about as high as can be played on a violin The piece 
ends strongly tonal with peaceful, consonant chords.
The Artemis Quartet succeeded in bringing out 
the powerful emotion and romantic harmonies in 
Schoenbergs quartet. The Artemis quartet also 
brought out Schoenberg's incredible string writing. The 
harmonic notes (very high-pitched notes produced by 
gently putting the finger on a string rather than pressing 
down) had a tone that was ethereal.
After the Schoenberg piece finished, and a moment of 
stunned silence had elapsed, the people in the audience 
broke out in massive applause and rose to their feet: 
They had loved the performance  and the piece, 
which perhaps delighted the members of the Artemis 
Quartet the most. Schoenberg, met with confusion and 
disdain by audiences at the premiere of the quartet in 
1907, now received the appreciation that he deserved
 it just came 100 years later.
With Schoenbergs music, particularly the atonal pieces 
that follow his first quartet, performers and listeners 
alike must work to get at the strong emotion in the 
work, tonal or not. For this concert, the Artemis Quartet 
did the bulk of the work, leaving the audience to enjoy 
the music. Perhaps audiences will realize that, with a 
bit of effort, they can find the feeling present in even the 
most challenging modern music.

Bloodyminded is a Chicago music collective often associated with 
"noise music. With roughly a dozen high-quality releases under 
its belt since 1996, Bloodyminded has many recordings worthy of 
columns in Paperhouse. However, since I am writing this article, I 
will focus on my personal favorite song by Bloodyminded.
The song is titled Cost," and it can be found on Bioodymindeds 
debut release Trophy. The song has a simple structure, as do 
many songs by Bloodyminded. A grating, digital-sounding drone 
rings throughout the two minutes and 13 seconds; it acts as a sort 
of backdrop for a shouted poem, which begins a few seconds 
into the song. Vocalist Mark Solotroff delivers his lyrics with 
incredible conviction. The lyrics establish a sort of second-person 
monologue in which the singer seems to be yelling at another 
person. However, as one delves into the lyrical framework, it 
becomes quite clear that Solotroff is proposing a situation that is 
distinctly not of this plane of reality
Solotroff begins by demanding an unnamed person to get into a 
car. The person (apparently some sort of prostitute) assumedly 
obeys, and the rest of the song proceeds as a sort of one-sided 
conversation. At one point, Solotroff yells, Heres the turnoff / Too 
bad youll be TURNED OFF / First by my idea of fun / And then, 
FOR GOOD." Solotroff concludes by yelling GET OUT. GET OUT! 
He then repeats the lyrical content in its entirety with added stress.
When one listens to the song there is nothing else. The rest of 
the universe recedes and only Cost" remains. It recognizes and 
engages the listener with the use of a spoken language, yet then 
immediately proposes an impossible human existence. I predict  
that if the entire worlds population was forced to listen to this song 
at sufficient volume for three full days and nights, it would cause 
all nations to collapse. All conflicts would cease and all men and 
women would no longer have need for shelter or technology of 
any sort. Even within the context of all recorded sound, the song 
stands in a class of its own. With the recording of the Trophy 
album, and especially Cost," Bloodyminded has achieved an 
extremely unique and informative form of human expression 
 one that all humans and perhaps even certain animals can 
benefit from experiencing.

Where art meets science
Carnegie Museum of Natural History offers educational illustrations
The Carnegie Museum of Natural History is packed with 
wonders: fossilized mammoths on the first floor, carefully 
preserved dioramas of African animals on the second, and 
exquisitely detailed watercolors on the third. Why is a 
watercolor exhibit hobnobbing with fossils instead of the 
Monets and Cezannes next door? The exhibit, Backyard 
Invasion, showcases work of the New York chapter of 
the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators (GNSI), whose 
illustrations portray invasive and endangered plant species of 
Pennsylvania. The field of science illustration is one of the few 
realms where science and art come together.
On display until July 1, the exhibit includes around 20 plates 
in various_media, including watercolor, colored pencil, and 
silverpoint (a method of drawing with a stick of silver which 
looks like graphite but is so much cooler) depicting native 
Pennsylvania plants and the invasive exotics from Europe 
and Asia that are wiping them out. Cynthia Morton, curator 
of botany at the museum and biology professor at Carnegie 
Mellon, remarked on a painting of an innocent-looking rose. 
This is the bad guy," she warned, pointing out the fringed 
bracts (hairy growths) at the base of the plants stalks that 
distinguish the rose from its victims. This kind of attention to 
detail is one of the hallmarks of a skilled science illustrator.
Science illustrators depict the natural world in painstaking 
detail. "We are technicians, NOT artists, GNSI member Joan 
Lee stated in an e-mail. "We like to make things beautiful, but 
accuracy is paramount, and beauty, if achieved at all, is a by
product of scientific illustration." Science illustrators may love 
art, but their first responsibility is to science.
One of the exhibits contributing artists, Mark Klingler, 
works as a science illustrator with the museum's vertebrate
paleontology department. Klingler, who began volunteering 
at the museum when he was a student in Carnegie Mellons 
graphic design program, explained that a science illustrator 
plays a dual role. As an artist, you're trying to do homage 
to your specimen, he said, "but when your project is 
complete, it has a life of its own." Klihgler sees art as a way . 
of "preserving a piece of history; unlike photographs, art 
conveys a concept  the speed of a peregrine or the delicacy 
of a butterfly. The science illustrator's job, Klingler said, is 
to "accurately depict or interpret the natural world for future 
generations." Science illustrators work is the only image 
we have of extinct species such as dinosaurs and passenger 
pigeons, and soon  if invasive plants have their way  it 
may be all we will have left of many of Pennsylvania's native 
species.
As an illustrator in the museum's paleontology department, 
Klingler produces reconstructions of ancient animals millions 
of years old. His illustrations have been featured on stamps, 
posters, and the cover of Science magazine. Starting with 
fragments of fossilized skeletons, he reconstructs the critters' 
muscles, skin, and fur (or scales), basing his reconstructions 
of these unknown features on living descendants. In an office 
crammed with fossils, models, reference books, drawings, 
feathers, and scientific journals, he flipped through a file on a 
new project, a reconstruction of an ornithopod (a herbivorous 
dinosaur once common in North America). The folder was 
crammed with sketches of fossils covered with notes in red 
ink, photographs of crocodiles and birds, and preliminary 
drawings. These kinds of projects give visitors a mental 
concept of animals they will never see, Klingler said, "giving 
a face to an idea. Although he uses a computer to render 
certain effects, Klingler prefers the freedom of a paintbrush 
and pencil. He knows an illustration has succeeded when
viewers react as if his animals were alive: when, for example, 
children beg their parents to get them a hadiocodium wui
 a 195 million-year-old, paperclip-sized mouse  for a pet.
Klingler has always been interested in science and has been 
raising moths and butterflies since he was a child; his eyes lit 
up as he described a rare ghost moth he is rearing in a potato. 
He was lucky enough to find a way to combine his love of 
science with his love of art at the museum. Although full
time jobs as a science illustrator are rare, Klingler encourages 
anyone interested in science and art to look into science 
illustration.
The Phipps Conservatory offers classes in botanical 
illustration; other local resources include the Pittsburgh 
Society of Illustrators [pittsburghillustrators.org), the 
Allegheny Highlands chapter of the American Society of 
Botanical Artists (http://huntbot.andrew.cmu.edu/ASBA/) and 
the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, located on the 
fifth floor of Hunt Library. GNSI's Joan Lee was encouraging, 
too  science illustration, she wrote, "can be learned by just 
about anyone with the motivation to do it."

Kogyo's prints, inspired by 
the stories of Japanese Noh 
theater, involved extraordi
nary effort; for each color, 
the artist had to carve a 
distinct woodblock.

Kogyo prints tell stories at the
New exhibit depicts actors of Japanese Noh theater
Tsukioka Kogyo was, by profession, an artist. You will see his 
work hanging on the walls of the Frick Art MuseUm, just like 
Hubert Robert and Matteo di Giovanni. But deep in his work 
lay traces of both a historian and a theater critic. Kogyos 
feature exhibit, The Prints of Tsukioka Kogyo, is an in-depth 
exploration of a Japanese art form called Noh theater, which 
has been an integral part of the countrys culture since the 
14th century.
Upon the centralization of power in Japan in the late 19th 
century, the structure of the government was beginning 
to take a formal shape. But this wasn't the only aspect of 
Japanese culture that was shifting; also evolving was the 
general way of life. "Things were changing quickly," said 
Sarah Hall, curator to the exhibit. But with this growth, there 
was also "a movement to preserve Japanese history and 
culture. Both Noh theater and Kogyos work were part of this 
preservation and restoration.
The Noh theater was a collection of old tales influenced 
by both Shinto and Buddhist philosophies, said Hall. The 
plot lines were neither intricate nor fantastical, but had an 
infectious  in Halls words  "simplicity and discipline in 
style. And even though the plays progressed slowly by nature, 
Hall says that Noh theater had exciting musical components; 
chorus chants, flutes, and drums all crept into the experience.
Although Kogyo had no part in writing the stories himself, 
a visit to the Kogyo exhibit is far from a field trip for an art 
history class. For one thing, Kogyos woodblock images 
of Japanese figures are lively in action, rich in color, and 
engaging in composition.
Almost all of the images in the exhibit are images of Noh 
theater actors dressed as warriors and motherly figures 
or masked as dragons and lions. The visual effects are 
astonishing, Hall said. In Shakkyo, two actors masked
as lions dance through a field of flowers against a plush red 
backdrop. Hajitomi shows a pale actress inside a lattice 
shutter with a pine tree swaying in the background.
The visuals of Kogyo's work undoubtedly pull the viewer in, 
but it is the fabulous stories behind the art that hold your 
interest. (After all, a museum-goer can only take so many 
works by the same artist in a single style, be it Kogyo or 
Warhol.) In Kamawa, the heroine wears a headdress with 
three candles and a kimono in an attempt to turn into an evil 
demon and take revenge against her unfaithful husband. 
Although Senju is a simple portrait of a peaceful-looking girl, 
the story is more involved  and tragic. A boy and girl meet, 
play music together, and become friends. After pledging 
never to forget his wonderful day, the boy is sentenced to 
execution because he is a prisoner of war.
Through works like these, Kogyo taps into the psychological 
undercurrents of daily life. In Dojoji," two prints sit side by 
side; one is of a woman calmly entering a dojo (a training 
facility) to visit her husband, who has cheated on her. The 
background is a simple white, her dress quaint and her white 
mask basic. The other print is impossibly macabre, with a 
black background and the same woman dressed as a demon 
seeking revenge on her husband.
And just when the breadth of characters, stories, and ideas 
begins to overwhelm, the museum gives the exhibit an extra 
kick with the addition of a woodblock in the center of one of 
the rooms. The centerpiece shows a woodblock as a work in 
progress, and explains in full detail Kogyo's process of making 
a finished product. Kogyo's work was difficult, requiring 
meticulous attention.
He would begin by drawing a study in ink for his print. Then, 
he would carve the image onto a woodblock, leaving behind 
only the parts of the picture which were going to be black. For
Frick
whatever parts he wanted to be colored, he would next need 
to carve out new blocks, color them to his liking, and align 
them perfectly with the print. It is only when you see this 
process' that you appreciate the sheer quantity of high-quality 
works that Kogyo produced.
Though the Frick is a ways from campus (and hard to reach 
by bus), Kogyos woodblocks justify the trip. His work is not 
only engaging and informative  it is also an eye-opening 
glimpse of a part of Japanese history that is, as Hall pointed 
out, older than Shakespeare.

Also at the Frick
For those looking to check out the exhibit during the 
week, there is a concert at the Frick Art Museum on 
Tuesday, February 13 at 7:30 p.m. The concert, titled 
Song of the Bamboo Pine, features koto player 
Masayo Ishigure. The koto is a soothing traditional 
Japanese stringed instrument. Also playing are James 
Nyoaraku Schlefer on shakuhachi (a Japanese bamboo 
flute), and another koto player, Charles Wei-Ting Tang. 
The elegant theater at the Frick is a choice location 
for live music, especially when it runs parallel to a 
visiting exhibit. Next Tuesdays concert should do well 
to complement Tsukioka Kogyo's images of Japan and 
Noh theater.

Deep blue sea, great big screen
Science centers IMAX hosts underwater documentary
Since the 2004 release of Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11, 
it is no longer uncommon to find documentaries gracing 
the screens of your local cineplex instead of moldering away 
on forgotten library shelves. Films like Fahrenheit 9/11 and 
March of the Penguins not only made it to movie theaters, 
but were largely successful. But the best way to watch any 
documentary is still on the biggest screen of all: the IMAX 
screen.
Deep Sea is the newest IMAX film playing at the Carnegie 
Science Centers Rangos Omnimax Theater. Following 
another recent trend in documentary-making, Deep Sea is 
narrated by two highly recognizable names: Johnny Depp 
and Kate Winslet. The movie explores the deepest parts of the 
ocean to find unique undersea'creatures living in their natural 
habitat.
Deep Sea's ocean inhabitants are not your average 
hammerhead sharks or humpback whales. Instead, the movie 
follows some lesser known, yet incredibly impressive, ocean 
animals. Directed by Howard Hall and produced by Toni 
Myers and Michele Hall, the film is interesting from start to 
finish.
Our goal is really to take you on a magical journey 
underwater to places that most of us have never been,"
Myers stated in a press release. Even with a large number of 
people who do scuba dive, lots of them have never met these 
characters or seen how they interact with other animals."
One of Deep Sea's uncommon creatures is the wolf-eel, 
which has a face only a mother could love, according to 
Winslets narration. Chomping on urchins with quivering 
jowls, the wolf-eel looks something like a grumpy old man
with a speckled white face. Viewers also meet the giant 
Pacific octopus, which has tentacles that can stretch up to,20 
feet across and can change its color and texture to match its 
surroundings.
Deep Sea examines the interrelatedness of underwater life, 
with a focus on the predatory and symbiotic relationships 
between creatures. A gigantic fried egg jellyfish, named for 
its curious resemblance to the breakfast food, preys on smaller 
jellyfish by trapping them in its far-reaching tentacles. The 
10-inch mantis shrimp defends itself against the octopus, its 
natural predator, by raising itself on its hind legs and hitting 
the octopus with claws as fast as a .22-caliber bullet. Green 
sea turtles and reef fish, however, share a much more peaceful 
and charming relationship. Algae accumulations on the sea 
turtles shells can slow them down, so the turtles visit reefs 
where fish flock to eat the algae: a "healthy vegetarian feast," 
according to Depp's narration.
The movie is visually stunning, thanks to its director, Howard 
Hall, who is a celebrated underwater cinematographer.
In Myers words, Deep Sea is a Vivid illustration of the 
astonishing array of the diversity of life. Wielding 1200- 
pound cameras, divers went to incredible lengths to find the 
captivating footage. The film is rife with alluring seascapes 
of gently swaying tube anemones (that look very much like 
palm trees) and multicolored coral reefs. In one of Deep Seas 
most aesthetically astounding moments, -the audience sees 
a frenzy of electrically colorful squids attacking anything and 
everything  including other squids and, at one point, the 
camera itself. Changing color several times a second, the 
squids make for a dazzling light show against the background 
of the very dark ocean water.
The filmmakers have put a number of spins on [the movie], 
said Frank Mancuso, Carnegie Science Center presenter and 
production assistant. Deep Sea does have a bit of an agenda: 
to demonstrate to viewers that the ocean is a delicate habitat 
subject to disruption by humans. Were taking more from 
the ocean than it can give," Depp narrates, citing alarming 
statistics about the number of big fish that are disappearing 
from the ocean due to shark-killing and over-fishing. However, 
the didactic tone is only a small part of the movie, which 
focuses more broadly on the diversity of underwater life.
The Rangos Omnimax Theater screen is an impressive four 
stories tall. Both the size of the screen and the theater's 64 
speakers make watching Deep Sea at the Rangos Omnimax 
an incredible experience. The underwater creatures are 
magnified on the screen and allow the audience to see 
even the most minute details of the deep-sea setting and 
inhabitants. The theater is certainly appropriate for capturing 
the vastness of ocean life.
Deep Sea is playing at the Carnegie Science Center until May 
and is supplemented with a program called UnderSea Alive!, 
which educates visitors about animal adaptations. Tickets 
for Deep Sea cost $8 and can be purchased at the Carnegie 
Science Center, online at www.CarnegieScienceCenter.org, 
or by calling 412.237.3400. Getting to the Carnegie Science 
Center by bus takes about 40 minutes and requires taking the 
500 inbound and transferring to the 16A outbound.

Student performers are Alive and Dancing!
Expect to stand and clap for an upcoming show based on Alvin Alleys Revelations
St. Petersburg, 1970. Alvin Ailey's performance of his own 
choreography earned him a standing ovation lasting over 
20 minutes. On Sunday, Alive and Dancing!"  a Carnegie 
Mellon dance production featuring Aileys piece Revelations"
 is sure to evoke a similar response.
"Revelations is a piece of choreography created by Ailey 
in 1961. The dance reflects Ailey's childhood experiences 
growing up as an African-American in Texas and Los 
Angeles, as well as the African-American struggle from the 
time of slavery to the civil rights movement. The production, 
which has been performed all over the world, is said to 
stir such emotions in its audience that the performance 
often ends with its viewers standing and cheering, even in 
countries where this form of appreciation is not the custom, 
as noted in an article from austin360.com.
This kind of emotional reaction is what inspired senior music 
theater major Antwayn Hopper to adapt Aileys choreography 
and create "Alive and Dancing!"
In eighth grade I went to an Alvin Ailey camp in Kansas 
City, where I first saw 'Revelations,'  Hopper said. "I was in 
awe. When I heard those spirituals and then saw the words 
and actions come to life before my eyes with his simple, but
very sourceful choreography, I knew I had to somehow pay 
tribute to him for what he did for me that night. Hopper 
and codirector Kara Lindsay, also a senior music theater 
major, have been running rehearsals with the productions 
23 dancers since October. Although most of the performers, 
are from the School of Drama, the performance includes one 
student from H&SS and Crystal Williams, a junior in the 
School of Music, who will be singing a spiritual.
Traditionally, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and 
his company consisted entirely of African-American dancers, 
but today both "Revelations" and Aileys dance school feature 
performers of all races. It is no longer black and white 
anymore," Hopper said. "[The dance] is so beautiful and has 
so much emotion; everyone is accepted.
"The original choreography was specifically about Aileys 
black roots, Lindsay said, [but 'Revelations' is a ballet] that 
everyone and anyone can relate to; its about what we're all 
going through. Its about humanity.
"Revelations consists of several different chapters, the first 
being the time of pilgrims and slaves, when the dancers 
perform in brown and tan costumes. In the next segment, 
titled Take Me to the Water," the dancers wear white,
which symbolizes baptism. The movements are fluid and 
aerobic. The final segment is a period of living and joy, after 
the dancers' souls have been cleansed. The performers 
wear vibrant colors and dance in a high-energy, athletic 
style. Hopper emphasized that what separates Aileys work 
from that of other choreographers is his ability to tell a story 
entirely through dance. "Were actors," he said. "That's why 
this ballet is really perfect for actors to perform. There is a 
story to tell in every movement."
"Alive and Dancing! will open with introductions by 
Elizabeth Bradley, the head of the School of Drama, and 
Jennifer Church, the dean of Student Affairs. The two 
performances, at 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., will take place in Rangos 
Ballroom 1 and 2 in the University Center. Tickets are $5 for 
students.

The New Pittsburgh Courier, a history in ima
City-County Building hosts a century of African-American history I bysarahMo9iniPiubxEdta
For Rod Doss, editor and publisher of The New Pittsburgh 
Courier, his favorite photo is a close-up shot of singer Billie 
Holiday. "Theres a lot to be said about whats happening 
here," explained Doss, appreciative of the Courier's roots. 
One of the original African-American newspapers, at its 
peak the Courier covered national and even global news
 using Pittsburgh as an anchor, not a boundary. "There 
are about four or five [newspapers] older than us, Doss said. 
We are perhaps the most prominent.
Though the Courier grew to be monumental, it had a humble 
start in 1907. The Courier began as a literary pamphlet 
produced by security guard Edwin Harleston, who used it 
to share his poetry and other writings. Originally called The 
Pittsburgh Courier, the endeavor expanded to include news 
articles by 1910, though in the beginning, at least half of the 
content was taken without credit from other publications. 
That same year, attorney Robert L. Vann took over as the 
Couriers primary editor.
In the early 20th century, black newspapers across the 
country were struggling to find a readership. According to
Robert L. Vann of The Pittsburgh Courier, a biography by 
Andrew Buni, publications like the Courier, which came 
out on Saturdays, had trouble keeping up with the white 
newspapers daily editions. African-American publications 
typically included news items concerning social and church 
events, but avoiding political issues. They were a voice, but 
not yet one that needed to be heard. As for potential readers, 
many African-Americans were either too proud or too 
humble to invest in the Courier. Some felt themselves above 
the black press, which was always struggling to 
find enough money and content to print. Moreover, 
many blacks were illiterate. Others couldnt 
afford to spend money on a luxury such as the 
newspaper.
To attract a greater audience, The Pittsburgh 
Courier took a risk; it bragged. The editors 
stretched the truth to make the publication seem 
more popular than it was. According to Buni's 
biography of Vann, the Courier added a masthead 
claiming a weekly readership of 10,000 AfricanAmericans, which might have been 
true  that is, counting roughly 75 percent of 
that number as readers borrowing editions that others had 
bought. Additionally, after mailing copies of the paper to 
friends in other states, staff members were so bold as to 
pronounce the Courier a national publication.
It wasn't too long until the Courier no longer needed to 
exaggerate its successes; the newspaper gained momentum 
as Vann brought important issues into the publication. 
Primarily, the Courier condemned the housing situation in 
the Hill District. The Hill District was home to the majority 
of Pittsburghs African-Americans, who had no plausible 
alternative to living in its worn-down houses, both unclean
Every photo has got a story, or 
multiple stories, to go with it.
Jim Brewer
At one time or another, everyone has dreamed of discovering 
buried treasure. While searching through some old boxes 
in the back of The New Pittsburgh Couriers office in the 
South Side, curator Jim Brewer found what many would 
consider the historical equivalent of buried treasure: 750,000 
photographs from the Courier's archives, depicting nearly a 
centurys worth of African-American politics, personalities, 
and culture.
It was  in a word  like a perpetual super-high, 
Brewer said. Every photo has got a story, or multiple 
stories, to go with it." Right now, these stories are 
being told in the lobby of the City-County Building, 
host to over 80 images from the archives of both the 
Courier and the Housing Authority of the City of 
Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Courier Images, which had its 
opening reception last Thursday evening, will remain 
on display through the end of the month.
Brewer's discovery came in 1995, but even 12 years 
later, his findings continue to provide a seemingly 
endless supply of photographs. It's out of this 
wealth of options that Brewer, curator to the Images 
archives, must choose the content of exhibits such as this 
one, featuring fewer than 100 images out of the thousands 
and thousands available.
Theres a whole lot of choices, Brewer said. We try to do 
a balance." It would be easy to hone in on a specific group 
of subjects: black athletes, politicians, or entertainers, for 
example. But the collection is more powerful when boasting 
a diverse selection of 20th-century faces, Brewer explained. 
The exhibit features photographs of major-leaguer Jackie 
Robinson, Supreme Court judge Thurgood Marshall, and 
actor James Earl Jones, among others.

ages
and unsafe. The situation only worsened as the population 
of blacks in Pittsburgh continued to grow, rising by nearly 
50 percent between 1910 and 1920, according to Buni.
Vann stressed the potential benefits of a building and loan 
association for African-Americans.
"A lot of things were going on back then," said Michele 
Jackson-Washington, deputy executive director of the 
Housing Authority. "[Vann] felt the need for AfricanAmericans to have a newspaper that reflected them. Though 
the exhibit is entitled Pittsburgh Courier Images, many of 
its pictures also come from the Housing Authority, which 
has an archive of about 2000 photographs. The majority of 
the photos are from the Hill District," Jackson-Washington 
explained. Theres a lot of vibrant history.
Still concerned with living conditions, Vann pushed content 
in the Courier that addressed the inaccessibility of medical 
care to African-Americans. Often sleeping in rooms with four 
or five inhabitants, blacks were the most likely to get sick, and 
yet the least likely to get help; at that time, hospitals rarely 
admitted black patients. Vann used the Courier as a platform 
to encourage the construction of an African-American 
hospital. Neither the building and loan association nor the 
hospital was ever constructed, but Vann's forthright ideas
 and the conviction behind them  succeeded in catching 
the attention of blacks across the country.
Youre talking about a time when the mainstream media 
wasnt that interested in talking about black people," said 
Kevin Amos, a program coordinator for Citiparks. At one 
time, it was distributed all over the world." At its peak, the 
Courier offered 21 editions in cities all over the country.
In 1940, Courier writer Ira Lewis stepped up as editor
following Vanns death. With Lewis in charge, the paper 
reached the height of its popularity. The Courier soon tackled 
what would become one of its most famous platforms: the 
Double V" campaign. Starting in 1942, the V" stood for 
victory, at home and overseas.
The "Double V campaign demanded equality for the black 
soldiers fighting in World War n. The Courier printed pictures, 
letters, and articles; it even developed a custom insignia
 two interlocking Vs  to help promote its cause. Probably 
the most powerful technique was the use of reporters abroad. 
"Significant coverage was given to black soldiers by way of 
foreign correspondents, Doss said. Both victories were finally 
attained in 1948, when President Truman signed an executive 
order banning the segregation of troops.
The paper became The New Pittsburgh Courier in 1965, 
when it was bought by John Sengstacke, who owned 
another historic black publication, The Chicago Defender. 
Prior to the name change, the papers influence had been 
waning since Lewis' death in 1948. Now, Doss explained, the 
Courier is working to regain some ground. We continue to 
go where our community is and seek out the news that fits 
them best, he said. "We have new challenges, obviously, 
Doss said, speaking of the Internet. Like all newspapers, the 
Courier is struggling to adjust to a more global readership. 
Last Thursday night, Doss and others were able to browse 
almost a centurys worth of photography, representing the 
distinguished past of The Pittsburgh Courier.
Duane Ashley, the director of Citiparks, considered the 
opening of Images the beginning of another successful 
celebration of Black History Month. This is an annual 
activity for the city of Pittsburgh," he said. Every year, the 
City-County Building hosts a new display in recognition of
African-American history. The tradition dates back to 1995, 
Ashley explained, and the theme varies annually. Past themes 
include African-American architecture, painting, and fiber 
art (textiles). The dynamics of this city are unique," Ashley 
added, commenting on the increasingly diverse community of 
Pittsburgh.
"Photography is images, Brewer said. "And images penetrate 
and educate." Staring at the exhibit, its hard to imagine so 
many of its photographs hidden undiscovered in a stack of 
cardboard boxes. The City-County Buildings walls could not 
go bare; the Couriers legacy could not go unappreciated.
Once a treasure is uncovered, it cant be reburied.
Located downtown on Grant Avenue between Forbes and 
Fifth, the Pittsburgh Courier Images exhibit at the CityCountry BQilding is an easy bus ride from campus.

On stage: Bugs of biblical proportions
Two local venues host performances of mind-bending plays
Two new plays in Pittsburgh offer thought-provoking stories. 
Bug, which opened last Friday in Oakland, slices close to 
the heart and may not be for everyone. On the other hand, 
Thorton Wilders The Skin of Our Teeth is truly timeless. 
Somehow, the same issues that are featured in a play written 
in 1942 apply to contemporary history: global warming, moral 
corruption, and the war on terror.
Bug
Bug  a dark comedy and sci-fi thriller  is not for the 
squeamish. Written by Tracy Letts (Man from Nebraska,
Killer Joe) and directed by Shannon Cochran, the play is set 
to run through February 18, at the former site of the Upstage 
Nightclub (on Forbes Avenue).
The action takes place in the motel room of Agnes White 
(Lissa Brennan), a divorced and lonely cocktail waitress 
whose mannerisms, accent, and intellect scream white trash 
America. An equal opportunity substance abuser, Agnes 
is introduced by her lesbian biker friend RC (Miki Johnson) 
to Peter (Patrick Jordan), an attractive drifter but delusional 
schizophrenic who ends up spending the night on the floor.
RC foreshadows, "Ted Bundy was good looking."
Offstage at the beginning of Act II, Peter, still the nice guy, 
reenters the motel room with breakfast in hand, only to 
come across a crying and bleeding Agnes at the feet of Goss 
(David Cabot), Agnes's ex-con ex-husband who shows up, 
apparently in violation of his parole, to impose on Agnes and 
take her money.
Following the beating, Agnes and Peter reveal their pasts 
to each other, growing closer all the while. The emotional 
openness quickly degenerates into Peter's paranoid tales 
of abduction (maybe even by aliens from Ogo) and medical 
experimentation led by his army superiors and their 
government sponsors. A nod to the Gulf War Syndrome 
eventually turns into a conspiracy theorists dream of mindcontrol devices.
The relationship turns to sex  ostensibly love. The following 
morning, Peter awakens cursing frantically after being bitten 
by a bug. Agnes abandons all reason and allows Peter to 
transform her motel room into an aphids worst nightmare 
with bug-zappers and fly ribbons.
Bug plunges into insanity in the final act as Peter, covered 
by his own blood after trying to cut out an implanted sac 
of bug eggs and removing his teeth because he believes 
they are transmitters a la Twelve Monkeys, stabs Dr. Sweet 
(the psychiatrist from whom Peter is fleeing, played by Ken 
Bolden), and then proceeds to use circular logic to bring an 
already-mamc Agnes to self-immolation as the pair proceeds 
to set the entire motel room on fire in an attempt to get rid of 
the bugs.
Bug is not escapist light fare, but a serious play that examines 
dysfunctional relationships and human weakness. "At the 
core its a love story," said Jordan, who played Peter. The 
connection between Agnes and Peter, well executed by 
Brennan and Jordan, is palpable to the audience. However, 
Peter's schizophrenia could use an added shot of realism in 
terms of body language. Cabot plays an abusive husband
excellently; his delivery of Hove you, Ill see you real soon, 
which conveys the perfect mix of sincerity and threat, is 
especially convincing. Jordan, also the plays producer, had 
seen Bug when it appeared in New York. I was laughing 
at parts and the woman next to me was appalled at me 
laughing.... [Bug] has a very different effect on the audience.
The Skin of Our Teeth
Close by at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, another production is 
running until February 11. The Skin of Our Teeth, put on by 
the Conservatory Theatre Company of Point Park University, 
features a cast entirely made up of students. Earning himself 
a Pulitzer Prize, Thornton Wilder wrote the play in 1942, 
when the world was still embroiled in war. The complexity 
of the play cannot be understated. The themes discussed 
are cleverly interspersed through anachronisms, as the Bible 
meets the Ice Age, not to mention modem warfare. At the 
time it came out, The Skin of Our Teeth was an experimental 
work, during which its actors broke their characters to 
address the audience directly.
The Skin of Our Teeth features the Antrobus family, whose 
characters are based on the Biblical figures of Adam, Eve, 
Cain, and an absent (murdered) Abel. Mr. Antrobus (Erik 
Cheski) is the innovative inventor of the wheel, lever, 
and other historical inaccuracies, which pepper the play 
throughout its entirety. He vacillates between hope and 
despair during the course of events, which include three 
threats to the existence of human civilization: an ice age, a 
flood of biblical proportions (featuring Noahs Ark), and war. 
Mrs. Antrobus (Sarah Bordenet) serves as the foundation of 
the family and is almost a Stepford wife, strongly advocating 
pre-sexual revolution morals and proper family values. Filling 
the leading role is Sabina (Lindsay Schramm), who is actually 
two characters: in Acts I and III, a sassy maid of the Antrobus 
household in Excelsior (ever upwards), N.J., with a Chicken 
Little world outlook; and a pageant show seductress in Act H 
Schramms role is perhaps the most complicated, because she 
plays both the biblical snake and a member of the family.
The play has a timeless quality," said Joe Scarillo, the stage 
manager. The overall clearest message that one can take 
away from The Skin of Our Teeth is to keep a stiff upper lip 
when faced with the worlds problems. Questions are raised 
regarding family relationships and child rearing as Henry 
(the Cain character played by Jeffrey A. Dudek) becomes 
increasingly estranged from his family, whose members 
resent his murder of his brother.
"Anyway, in 100 years it'll all be the same, explains Sabina. 
Although this may be cynical, The Skin of Our Teeth ends 
with Sabina challenging the audience to write the story of 
humanity. The actors are condemned to reenact history, while 
hope for change is thrust upon the audiences shoulders.

Top five films of 2006
Experts weigh in on last years movie masterpieces
2006 may not have been the most memorable year in movie
making history, but hell, it was better than the dreck January
2007 has been serving us. Come on... Epic Movie? Seriously? 
In order to focus our minds (and feet) on happier times, we're 
teaming up yet again  in the midst of awards season no less
 to bring you the five most memorable flicks of 2006.
5. John Tucker Must Die
One hot guy, three pissed-off girls, and what's-her-face from 
American Dreams. Why's this on our 2006 Most Memorable 
List? Well, other than the blink-and-youll-miss-it, girl-on - 
girl makeout scene, any movie with the hot gardener from 
Desperate Housewives is worth a second look  or a jaw 
dropping stare. You know, if you're into that sort of thing. 
However, if you're into the emo art boys instead, youd 
probably prefer the other Tucker, played by Penn Badgely.
4. X-Men III: The Last Stand
So being a superhero is hard work. But now there's a cure.
X3 asks the long-standing question: Given the chance, would 
you change what makes you you? We walked out of the movie 
wondering about that. Sure, it's based on a comic book, but 
that doesn't mean this movie is just intended for teenage
boys. Although, if-you are a teenage boy, you'll love this movie 
for the shots of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, a.k.a. Mystique, halfnaked when she (spoiler!) loses her powers.
3. Happy Feet
Tap-dancing penguins? When we first heard about the 
movie, we thought it was an actual event. And by we, we 
mean Tima. Anyways, finding out it was a movie was slightly 
disappointing. But upon discovering that the penguins tap to 
the greatest hits of the '80s and the '90s, we fell in love. The 
feeling increased tenfold when Seymour broke out into Grand 
Master Flashs-The Message. Besides, who wouldnt love a 
movie where The Matrix's very own Agent Smith voices the 
hunchback patriarch of the penguin clan? Happy Feet ranks 
as one of the most interesting movies of the year. Honestly, we 
just want tap-dancing penguins.
2. Snakes on a Plane
We've been over this before. Ophidians invade an aircraft. 
Samuel L. is a badass. Kenan Thompson is also present, 
despite our wishes that hed just stayed home with Kel.
The sounds of Cobra Starship rocked your world. What else 
is there to say? I guess we'll just have to be on tenterhooks
until a sequel emerges. In the meantime, we should start a 
pool predicting its title. We cant lie: we're strongly divided 
between Goats on a Boat and Penguins on a ... Schmenguin?
1. Little Miss Sunshine
A beauty pageant, a road trip in a yellow Volkswagen bus, 
and a dysfunctional family: Sounds like standard fare for the 
indie-film market. So how did this movie break out into the 
mainstream and bag three Oscar nominations? Perhaps it was 
Steve Carells oddly serious  yet darkly comedic  role as 
the gay, suicidal uncle/number one-or-two Proust scholar in 
the country. Maybe it was Paul Dano's silent but mesmerizing 
performance as an angsty teenager or Alan Arkin's role as the 
feisty, heroin-loving grandfather. Perhaps it was Little Miss 
Sunshine herself, Abigail Breslin, who hit the screens as the 
most lovable pageant-head since Sandra Bullock. Shut up.
We know you love Miss Congeniality too. Regardless of which 
character tickled your fancy, the ensemble cast and brilliant 
script are reminders of why we remain enthralled by motion 
picture magic.

Whats in store for 2007?
Even if it doesn't, its bound to have some 
awesome action scenes, especially 
when the monster Grendel is attacked 
by Beowulf, our beloved hero. Also, 
Hrothgars a pretty kickass name.
If you've read Harry Potter and the Order 
of the Phoenix, you have to be excited 
about this. It should be chock-full of 
amazing special effects, not to mention 
big-screen renditions of some of kiddie 
lits vilest villains and saddest offings.
Also on the horizon are standard Will 
Ferrell offerings (Blades of Glory), a Steve 
Carell comedy (Bruce Almightys sequel 
Evan Almighty), another superhero flick 
(Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer), 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Halo, and 
Transformers. Whew!
What were trying to say is: Next semester, 
McConomy will rock our couch-potatomovie-watching-popcorn-eating-slurpeeguzzling, fuzzy toesocks.
Lucky for us, Januarys dearth of lovable 
movies isnt par for the 2007 course. After 
scouring the Internet, weve found that the 
upcoming year is flinging more than a few 
cinematic thrills our way. Our fan squeals 
cannot be suppressed. No lies.
One of the hallmarks of this year is 
sure to be the number of three-quels 
hitting theaters. We can look forward to 
Spiderman 3 (keywords: revenge, black 
spidey suit), Shrek3 (more Puss in Boots!), 
Oceans Thirteen (eye candy that appeals 
to everyone), Pirates of the Caribbean: At 
World's End (better be better than Dead 
Mans Chest), and Rush Hour 3 (ugh).
Speaking of the number tres: Expect 
300, based on Frank Millers graphic 
novel of the infamous 480 BCE Battle of 
Thermopylae, 300 has an incredible trailer 
and has generated quite a bit of early 
buzz. Shweta will be happy as long as its 
more accurate than Troy.
Tima never understood Beowulf when 
she read it in high school, but the movie 
version will hopefully clear up a few things.

Big Als Metal Shop
Kiss still Alive  seven years later
Just a few weeks ago, I was able to get my ears around 
what was supposed to be Kiss' Alive IV. Recorded at British 
Columbia Place Stadium in Vancouver on December 31,1999, 
this was to be the show to end all shows  as the world's 
computers screens went blank and chaos enveloped us. What 
better way to enter that uncertainty than with Gene, Paul, 
Peter, and Ace? We bought the T-shirts, and all we needed 
afterwards as proof was hearing ourselves screaming on the 
aforementioned CD. Sadly, as with all projects, there is the risk 
that things get shelved, and perhaps ignored, as time passes. 
But for those of us there, it was a magical night that won't be 
forgotten anytime soon.
Vancouver was a sleepy town, afraid of its own shadow ever 
since the Stanley Cup riots of '94. Public festivals and events 
were canceled or just picked up and left due to the restrictions 
in keeping with this fear of mass violence and revelry. Pretty 
much the only fun we had during that decade was watching 
the World Cup together on Commercial Drive, but that's 
another story. Making things worse, the radio stations were 
boring due to Canadian content regulations and our music 
scene struggled with venue closings. All this left us: the rock 
fans who couldn't stand to hear another Sarah Maclachlan 
song on the "rock stations." You can only deny someone their 
birthright for so long  and although we had to wait until 
the close of the century for a spectacle like Kisss millennium 
show, it also gave us hope that the coming years would be 
more fun. And we were right.
That night, I remember stumbling toward the cavernous 
dome with my good friend to the end, Sudeep Bala. The 
best shows, as Ive written before, are the ones where the 
atmosphere outside the venue is as tense as the backup 
singers coughing up backstage. With an empty bottle of Jack,
we arrived in style to the white elephant that is B.C. Place. To 
this day, I don't know how on earth we made it through those 
air-lock doors, and I especially dont know how we convinced 
a couple of young ladies to get us on the floor, but we did. 
Most baffling, however, is how we were able to stand the 30 
minutes or so of Nickleback, the opening act. Yes, I know that 
they are Canadian, but we have been apologizing for that for 
the last decade, so lay off.
Anyway, as the chants of "KISS KISS KISS grew louder, the 
lights dimmed, and the video montage began. Reaching 
back to the early days, the footage showed the bands first 
appearances on stage, a fresh, puppy-faced Paul Stanley, 
pointing into the camera much as he does now. With senserattling explosions, Kiss came out to "Psycho Circus," and 
immediately afterwards launched into "Shout it out Loud and 
"Deuce." Anybody who I've had the pleasure of knowing can 
tell you that one beer and Im out  imagine what flash pots, 
lasers, and loud firebombs did to a half a bottle of J.D.
Awesome, considering the classic Kiss lineup and I'm 
guessing at least 30,000 fellow Kiss Army members 
surrounding us. Just as cool was watching Ace handle '80s 
Kiss amazingly, with "Lick it Up", my favourite tune of that 
period, reborn in his hands. "I Love it Loud," "Love Gun," and 
the surprising (to me) Black Diamond" all rocked, but then all 
good things must come to an end. As the final strains of Rock 
and Roll All Nite rang in my head the next two hours, all I 
could remember was the feeling of completion  that way 
you feel after knowing that something good just happened 
and that something even better may be on its way.
Listening to the album now, seven years after, I can maybe 
hear the strains of a band at the end of its reunion, or maybe
tired after years of touring. Maybe. Mostly, though, I hear the 
sound of something that I had the privilege of experiencing 
that I'll cherish forever. Seven years later, Vancouver is a 
thriving metal and rock town. Shows that we had to hop on 
1-5 down to Seattle to catch now come up north, and we have 
not one but two metal radio shows on the air. Combine that 
with a metal-only record shop and the result is something tha 
we could only imagine growing up. Venues have reopened 
and the city is becoming fun again  perhaps you can blame 
a little of that on Kiss. You too can hear this album, along with 
the other Alive albums as part of the new Kiss Alive! 1975- 
2000 box set, which is now available.
Before I go, I've had a lot of fun these last five years in 
Pittsburgh writing for you  I have a feeling that also 
may come to a close as I look to finish my doctorate here. 
Wherever I go next, Ill always take a piece of this town along 
with Metropol, Rock Jungle, the Rex Theater, the Palace in 
Greensburg, Starlake Pavillion, and the sorely missed Club 
Laga. Please keep the live scene here going  tons of shows 
are coming up like Mastodon/Priestess at the Rex on February
9 and Unearth on February 14. And while you're at it, buy a 
T-shirt and feed the band!
Cheers,
A1

So, it appears that this winter thing is in full force. Remember to stay 
warm by wearing layers, eating hot meals, and getting plenty of rest. 
Of course, you can always just stay in bed and miss all your classes, 
but that might be detrimental to that whole education" thing you keep 
hearing about.
Things will probably start to get a bit stressful this week with the first 
round of tests and papers coming. Just try to think of singing bananas 
for a quick pick-me-up. Also, I probably shouldnt say this, but Im pretty 
sure the answer for #2 is 2307.2.
Lets make a deal. Youll get uplifting, positive, and just generally happy 
horoscopes for the rest of the semester if whenever you see a Tartan 
on the floor youll pick it up. Its not only cleaning up campus, but its 
also a good way to stretch.
Its getting harder to see what the stars are saying about you, seeing 
how its been grey for a month. In any case, Im sure a combination of 
good and bad things will happen depending on how you look at it.
Time to get excited! The highlight of the new month will happen early 
when you see a blimp! No seriously, it's going to be so awesome!
Lets just get it out of the way early. Valentines Day is coming, and yes, 
you're right in your assumption that no one is actually looking forward 
to it. Make your own holiday with that special someone by buying all the 
same sort of gifts on the 15th instead. Hurray markdowns!
It might seem early, but seniors can already smell graduation in the air. 
Unfortunately, right now it just reminds them of waiting to hear back 
from graduate schools and all those damn interviews. Happy times.
First things first: relax. Take a good deep breath. Theres a good chance 
no one saw that. Just start walking away. Count to 10, and if you still 
feel nervous about it, just start laughing maniacally.
Aw! That bunny is so cute! Did you see it? It just ran by here! Oh man, 
keep your eye out for it because he is just soooooo cute! Its okay if you 
miss all your classes today; your professor will totally understand. He 
might even come outside and join you!
If someone wearing a long jacket asks you about the jade monkey, 
just reply by saying that you havent seen it yet, but that walruses sure 
look funny. If no one asks you about it, then everything is falling into 
place.
Theres a fine line between being committed to something and being 
committed to an insane asylum. This week youll achieve a better 
understanding of that statement.
Write down some lyrics, or maybe a poem, and keep working on that 
doodle in your notebook. This will be a good week to express yourself; 
just be careful about singing in the shower because shampoo is pretty 
nasty if swallowed.

Jamband moe. will be rolling through the North Hills of 
Pittsburgh tonight. The band is playing a free show at Borders 
in support of its newest album, The Conch. Over the past five 
years or so, moe. has undergone a rapid transformation, writing 
songs that are more accessible to mainstream audiences. The 
groups melodies are catchier and less quirky than its older 
material.
Although some fans feel like moe. is trying to abandon the 
jamband scene into which it was pigeon-holed, moe.s new 
album still has plenty of the feel-good vibes, lengthy guitar 
solos, and musical interplay that made the group so popular.
Speaking of popular, moe. has been playing to larger and larger 
audiences over its career, and just last month played a New 
Years Eve gig at Radio City Music Hall. Given the constantly 
evolving direction of the band and the intimate setting of the 
Borders venue, Monday nights gig is a must-see.

The way you dress could determine if you walk 
away with a job offer.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 5, 2007
1) Perfect your rsum
Your resume is a single 
piece of paper that 
represents you every step 
of the way  give it the 
attention it deserves.
The 15-second read
Your resume is one of as 
many as 500 resumes 
that a recruiting team 
from a top firm is likely 
to get this week. Each 
resume will get about 
15 seconds of attention 
before it lands in the 
yes pile or the "no 
pile, so make every word 
count.'
Format for a quick scan
Creating a readable 
document will make 
it less painful for your 
recruiter if your resume is 
number 198 for the day.
Break it up into sections: 
education, experience, 
activities, skills, and 
interests  use a line 
or two and show some 
personality. Your goal 
is to capture the short 
attention span of the 
recruiter. Using these 
categories will help you 
cast a broad net, so theyll 
be most likely to identify 
with something on your 
resume. Use indentation, 
spacing, bold text, and 
bullet points to organize
the information on your 
page. But be careful; 
dont go overboard. If you 
have any doubt, ask your 
career counselor.
Begin to tell your story
Your resume should begin 
to tell a story about who 
you are. We say begin, 
because you want to 
reveal enough to pique 
the readers interest 
but save enough of the 
interesting details for you 
to talk about later.
Leave zero errors
Its that simple. Attention 
to detail is among the 
most common points in 
a job posting, so dont 
submit a resume that will 
disqualify you. Proofread 
twice. Get a friend to 
proofread. Get your career 
counselor to proofread.
Customize for the 
company
If you have a diverse set 
of interests, like many 
Carnegie Mellon students, 
youll probably be meeting 
with recruiters from a 
variety of companies.
Consider creating tailored 
resumes for various 
companies that highlight 
the most relevant aspects 
of your experience.
2) Make a gameplan
The career fair is not a 
time to learn about a 
company youre interested 
in. When you step up 
to the plate, you should 
already know a lot.
Know the industry
Read up on the industry 
youre interested in so you 
can speak intelligently 
about it.
Magazines, newspapers, 
and websites offer a 
wealth of information 
related to different 
industries.
You need to know the 
who-what-when-wheres 
of the industry youre 
specifically interested in: 
Whos important in the 
field; what do they do?
What companies have 
what kinds of influences in 
the industry? When did the 
biggest shifts in materials, 
methods, and people take 
place? Where do crucial 
companies in the field do 
business?
If you know your field, 
you can chat it up with 
the bigwigs  then youre 
already ahead.
Know the company
If you know the industry 
and the company, thats 
even better. Use sites
like hoovers.com (free on 
campus) or guidestar.org, 
which offer background 
on companies and non
profits, respectively.
Make sure to check out 
the company's website 
and find news about them. 
Also, seek out and talk to 
people who work or have 
worked for the company to 
get the inside perspective.
Know the position
Find out all you can about 
the position so you can 
make the most of the short 
time youll have with a 
recruiter.
Look into what the 
position is like throughout 
the industry, and more 
specifically within the 
company. How do they 
compare? What is the pay 
like?
Know yourself
Be ready to talk in detail 
about your experiences 
related to the job you are 
aiming for. What classes 
have prepared you for this 
position? What previous 
job experiences have you 
had related to the field? 
What did you accomplish 
there? Can you support 
your claims about your 
personality strengths?
3) Know what to expect
The EOC can be 
intimidating. Be ready.
Take a deep breath
The most important 
thing to remember is that 
this career fair is not a 
life-or-death situation.
In fact, the majority of 
people find jobs by means 
other than a career fair.
Especially if it's your first 
time visiting a career fair, 
look at the event as a way 
to meet some interesting 
people and learn more 
about what sort of job you 
are interested in.
Know where to go
When you walk through 
the door, youll find 
yourself in a mess of 
people, some milling 
uncomfortably about and 
others confidently moving 
from booth to booth.
You should have a list of 
companies you want to 
visit and know where their 
booths are located  use 
the maps on page C8.
Avoid the long lines
 wait until the queue 
dies down if you can.
Wait patiently for a free 
recruiter, then step 
forward and speak up.
Prepare your introduction
In one smooth sentence, 
you should explain who 
you are and why are you 
talking to the recruiter 
to whom youve just 
introduced yourself.
Keep in mind that in 
these initial seconds, the 
recruiter will formulate 
his or her opinion 
of you. Most people 
fumble through their 
introductions, so if you 
practice, you will stand 
out. If you really want to 
nail it, practice aloud with 
friends  a little weird, 
but worth a job.
Make your work easily 
accessible
Portfolios are professional 
ways to present your work 
to potential employers, 
like writing and designs.
A well-assembled 
portfolio also includes 
personal blurbs about 
each work included.
In these blurbs, you 
can tell your potential 
employer any challenges 
you successfully 
overcame or skills you 
learned through creating 
a specific work in your 
portfolio.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 5, 2007
4) Act like a professional
The easiest way to get 
recruiters to take you 
seriously and remember 
your name is by presenting 
yourself professionally. If 
you look sharp, act smart, 
and actively seek out 
opportunities, youll leave a 
good impression and make 
a later interview that much 
easier.
Hold yourself with poise
Some communication 
experts assert that body 
language has the most 
significant effect on the 
impression you make when 
you meet someone. Stand 
tall, with equal weight on 
each foot. Avoid shifting
your weight excessively. 
Use your hands calmly 
and naturally as you talk, 
keeping them out of your 
pockets. You want to 
convey your confidence 
by standing and moving 
comfortably.
Make contact
Don't give recruiters a 
dead-fish handshake. 
Nothing spells bad 
first impression like a 
limp, floppy greeting.
A handshake can tell 
recruiters volumes about 
you  how confident you 
are, how excited you are 
to be talking to them, 
and how well you might
blend with their corporate 
culture. A firm handshake 
and direct eye contact 
will go a long way toward 
helping your case.
Be positive
Dont spend time criticizing 
your previous employment, 
either. You will probably 
be asked about your past 
work experience, and you 
dont want to answer with 
a long tirade about how 
your former boss had the 
IQ of a jar of mayonnaise. 
Its better to concentrate 
on what you learned from 
the experience or how it 
helped refine your long
term employment goals.
5) Ask real questions
Ask targeted questions
Ask about specific 
positions inside the 
company  this will show 
recruiters that youre 
serious enough about 
the job to have already 
investigated what they 
have to offer.
Try to ask focused 
questions about what its 
actually like to work for the 
company.
Some good starting points 
are what an average 
work week is like, what 
requirements prospective
employees should have, 
what the companys 
approach to diversity 
is, and what the overall 
company atmosphere is 
like.
Asking good questions 
will help in two ways: 
First of all, you will learn 
about the companies 
youre interested in 
working for, and you will 
also impress recruiters 
with your initiative to 
learn. The information 
will be invaluable in your 
interview.
Listen and take notes
Use good eye contact, nod, 
and clarify points you don't 
understand to show youre 
actively listening.
Dont forget to jot notes 
down, too. An excellent 
way to keep things simple 
and organized is to collect 
a business card from 
each recruiter you talk to 
and write notes about the 
company, the job, and the 
recruiter on the back. That 
way, youll have a handy 
resource to look back on 
later  pre-cataloged and 
everything.
Information Systems Graduate Program
Who Are We?
Direct Energy is one of North Americas leading integrated energy 
companies. We serve over 5 million customers in Texas, Northeastern 
US, Alberta, and Ontario. This 6-year old company has impressive 
growth with over 5,500 employees and $8 billion dollars in revenue.
Who Are We Looking fo
This career opportunity is open to information systems/ computer-related 
students who will be graduating (undergraduate or graduate degree) 
before September 2007. This opportunity will have you working on three 
technical assignments over a 2-year period in different groups/locations. 
During your assignment will have an opportunity to learn from and 
interact with many of our various lines of business; Energy Services, 
Home Services, Business Markets, Upstream Gas and Power and 
Energy Management Group (EMG), solving problems and implementing 
solutions from day one.
You will also experience four business-related mini rotational 
assignments. These mini-rotations involve different areas of Direct 
Energy, both inside and outside of the IS department (IS Finance, 
Infrastructure Operations, EMG, Marketing, Finance etc). The overall 
program experience ensures that the graduates build both strong 
technical and business skills.
Because this opportunity presents you with the exciting experience to 
work in various cities, you must be able to live and work in both the US 
and Canada. International students are welcome.
6) Follow up graciously
The best way to stay fresh 
in the minds of recruiters 
is by writing each of them 
a letter a few days after 
you talk to them.
The letter doesnt have 
to be very fancy, just a 
brief note reminding them 
who you are and where 
you met. Mention your
conversations to jog their 
memories. (Remember the 
notes you were taking?) 
Thank them, say you 
enjoyed the conversation, 
and ask to meet again. 
This way, you've put your 
foot in the metaphorical 
door; complete the 
transaction by saying you'll 
follow up by phone in a
7) Always be networking
The career fairs are great, 
but around three-quarters 
of all jobs are won through 
networking. Your best bet 
is to'start schmoozing 
early.
Get into the network
Career services organizes 
frequent networking events 
that involve both corporate 
recruiters and Carnegie 
Mellon alumni from all 
fields.
Attend every networking 
event you can; the ability 
to network comfortably 
and gracefully will make 
you stand out like nearly 
no other skill. Practice is 
the only way to learn. Youll 
find that even after youve 
gotten a job, networking 
is the most common way 
to score a promotion or 
another job.
Show up and dive in'
Show up on time and
dressed sharply, on par 
with other guests. Feel free 
to have something to drink 
and some easy-to-eat food. 
Stack your cup on your 
plate and hold a napkin 
under the plate. This way 
your right hand is free for a 
firm shake.
Work the room
Have a plan for who you 
want to talk to and get 
to it. Use the general 
introduction you practiced 
for the career fair to 
introduce yourself to 
new people. Ask polite 
questions and share 
yourself. Keep good eye 
contact; refrain from 
shopping for other 
people to meet. Keep a 
time limit of five to 10 
minutes, and politely leave 
with a pre-prepared exit 
line: Theres a friend I 
need to speak with. It was 
a pleasure to meet you.
few days. The phone call 
will give you a chance to 
solidify the meeting and 
make a second impression
 and get a read on what 
the recruiters might think 
of you. Be confident and 
proactive in setting up 
the second meeting  it 
will probably be your best 
chance.
Before you depart, trade 
business cards and, if 
youre interested, arrange 
a time on another day to 
continue the conversation.
Bring it forward
At the end of the night, 
review the business cards 
youve collected and 
note the topic of your 
conversation and some 
important details about the 
contact to help you start 
up the conversation next 
time.
These are called tickler 
files and are a hugely 
successful tool used 
by countless business 
professionals in all 
industries. Be sure to 
thank the host before you 
leave, so youll be invited 
to the next gathering.
To make an even better 
impression, send a formal 
thank-you note.
