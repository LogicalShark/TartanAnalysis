University Police are 
currently investigat
ing an incident of 
robot cruelty after 
nine defaced 
mobots were
found 
scattered 
around cam
pus. University Center staff 
recovered the first painted mobot trying to climb the stairs in 
Kirr Commons and began re
ceiving calls of similar findings 
from as far away as Scaife Hall. 
The vandals reportedly used 
spray chalk, a semi-permanent 
marking tool historically used 
for sorority advertising.
Robot rehabilitators have 
been unable to remove the 
spray chalk from the mobots 
exoskeletons. Once the spray 
chalk eventually wears off, 
theres a high probability that 
its going to gum up the mobots bearings, said Milton 
Jangles, owner of Lube-URight, a mobot repair shop.
While details are still com
ing out, a flock of reporters 
has been found photographing 
the mobots in their debilitated 
state.
Anonymous sources have 
pointed the finger at Kappa 
Lambda Omicron Kappa Kap
pa Kappa Kappa Kappa (KLOKKKKK), the campus animalrights-interest fraternity.

University plans update to post emergency reminder system
J.W. Ramp/Surveillance Consultant
According to Tartan Surveillance Consultant J.W. Ramp, these RBDS test units will notify the campus of emergencies 
much later than current systems. Also, they may spy on you.
MICHAEL KAHN
Junior Senior Forum Manager
University officials announced 
today that a new version of the 
emergency notification system  
aptly titled Alert Later  would 
be rolled out next month. The 
update will enhance the current 
features of the system used to 
notify the campus community 
of emergencies, adding longer 
delays between e-mail and text 
message notifications.
This project continues the 
administrations effort to com
municate with the universitys 
members.
With the new Alert Later 
system, we have brought our 
emergency communications sys
tem in line with what the world 
expects from Carnegie Mellon, 
Vice President of Campus Affairs
Michael Murphy said. Our stu
dents and faculty are renowned 
for their poor communication 
skills and procrastination. By re
focusing our efforts on delaying 
notifications, weve brought the 
alert system in line with the rest 
of the university.
Some students have criticized 
the previous system, Alert Now, 
for not having a fast response 
time. 1 trust the emergency alert 
system to keep me safe when 
there are emergencies on cam
pus, said Jonas Inkheim, a firstyear computer science major. 
When there was a fire in Wean 
Hall, I ignored the fire alarm, so 
I didnt leave until I got my noti
fication. I was almost consumed 
by the flames. The updated sys
tem should reduce unreasonable 
expectations such as instant noti
fication.
Initial tests of the post-emer
gency reminder system were suc
cessful, and officials expect to 
begin implementing it starting in 
late April. One beta-tester, Sam
my Jordan, who was involved in 
both Alert Now and Alert Later 
development, expressed his satis
faction: I was a little concerned 
back when we tested Alert Now 
about the half-hour delays. They 
seemed long for an emergency 
communication system. Im 
happy to say that the improved 
hour-long delays in Alert Later 
are great for reminding me after 
an emergency is over.
Members of the university 
community should remember to 
register for the Alert Later service 
at www.cmu.edu/alert. Officials 
aim to have registration open in 
the next week, but admit that the 
deadline may slip into next year.
A note from your scandalous editor
We will however ask that you 
kindly put your lawsuits away 
and simply enjoy the ride.
Dear children and elders,
This week, we at The Tartan 
have spent some time creating an 
issue in honor of April Fools Day. 
It contains many things, some 
real, some less real, and a few 
which may be complete fabrica
tions. While many of the events, 
names, places, officials, and acts 
may seem as if they could be real,
they are frequently fiction under 
the protection of satire.
The same goes for any seem
ingly true event we have de
scribed. If these acts do later 
come true, we apologize in ad
vance for our foresight.
We intend that this issue will 
amuse you, but unfortunately we 
can make no such promises.PATRICK GAGE KELLEY

Capes on the rise; community proposes population control
uena LiwwinsKi/uapturer or iNignt tives
Cape children cry in the darkness from the stress of the hunt.
MEELA DUDLEY
Workin' the Corner
You see them sitting alone on 
city buses in the early hours of 
the morning, perched cryptically 
in the dark corners of the Under
ground, feasting on their nights 
purchase, or even peeking at you 
from deep within the confusing 
corridors of Doherty Hall  but 
who are they, and what is the 
significance of their beautiful yet 
seemingly daunting outerwear?
These are the caped crusad
ers of Carnegie Mellon; theyre 
here, theyre, a force to be feared, 
and their numbers are quickly in
creasing. One would be surprised 
to find out that, in recent years, a 
significant population of Carne
gie Mellon students have decided 
to get cloaked.
But what does this mean for 
the common Carnegie Mellon 
student? Do these rising popula
tions pose a threat?
Their capes may at first ap
pear charming, local zoolo
gist Yugi Oh said, but do not be 
fooled. These creatures are full of 
unbounded mystery. We have yet 
to uncover the details on the spe
cies or what exactly theyre hiding 
under those woolly veils.
Dangerous was most cer
tainly an appropriate description 
when, last Tuesday, a local stu
dent was attacked after suppos
edly getting too close to a caped 
creature.
I was just curious, first-year 
drama major Biz Natch said. I 
had heard so much about the 
Caped Carnegies, but had never 
seen one in person. It looked as if 
it was playing some sort of game 
on the corner of the Cut, and as 
I approached, I discovered Magic 
cards. Apparently, the caped are 
protective of these paper masterworks. It leaped onto me, and I 
was drowning in a sea of navy and 
emerald-green felt.
In order to prevent incidents 
like this in the future, some have 
proposed controlled cape-hunting as an appropriate response. 
In theory, members of the Carn
egie Mellon community would be 
able to monitor cape populations 
through recreational game hunt
ing. A smaller cape population 
would ensure increased safety 
around campus. This issue, how
ever, has left the campus divided.
Those in favor of the hunt have 
taken action. Do not be fwooled 
by dher twoothy gwins, said Uni
versity Police officer Elmer Fuddwugger in a recent address to 
the Carnegie Mellon community 
from the steps of Doherty Hall. 
The cwoaked cwusaders awe 
dangewous. I uwge all students 
to cawwy protection with them at 
all times. Its wawlock season. 
However, a large population 
of students greatly objects to the 
hunting of capes.
Just last week, protesters - 
gathered at the Fence and began 
posting signs with the names of 
their fellow capes who have al
ready been hunted. This sym
bolizes the reality of the danger 
that capes face every day, senior 
art major Gee Twentai said. The 
violence is so unnecessary. These 
caped creatures dont feel as 
though theyre welcome, and we 
just want to show them that they 
have a home here. Here, with us, 
in our arms.
Debates over the next steps 
are expected to continue well into 
the coming week, so visit www. 
thetartan.org for continued up
dates.
Tepper launches new program for those in need
COURTNEY WinEKIND
Tepper Work Hopeful
With an attitude of benevo
lence that seems out of character 
for a group of individuals raking 
in billions of dollars annually, the 
Tepper School of Business is now 
offering opportunities for those 
who are less fortunate.
In a recent press release, Tep
per administrators announced 
that they would be sharing some 
of the money and good fortunes 
promised to Tepper students at 
admittance with other students 
at Carnegie Mellon whose futures 
may not be filled with country 
clubs and sweater vests.
Now, students in the College of 
Fine Arts and the College of Hu
manities and Social Sciences can 
find employment doing menial 
tasks such as shining shoes, tying 
ties, or arranging paperweights.
We realized that, with the 
economic downturn, there are 
many students in need  and 
we at Tepper have the chance 
to help, explained Tepper dean 
Kenneth B. Dunn. Not all stu
dents have spacious offices wait
ing for them at graduation, but 
they can clean ours.
Dunn stressed that, while the 
program is focusing on students 
graduating from CFA and H&SS, 
the positions will also be offered 
to others in need at Carnegie Mel
lon.
There are many opportuni
ties at Tepper for all students, re
gardless of major. We realize that 
many at Carnegie Mellon have 
other difficulties facing them at 
graduation  issues of social 
capability or presentability. Not 
all students can match up to the 
strapping young men and women 
of our school, Dunn said.
We even hope to consider 
staff applicants. We have already 
received several requests from 
recently canceled majors includ
ing anthropology and political 
science. Our students certainly 
dont need education from previ
ously employed faculty in these 
departments, but perhaps they 
could alphabetize our books or 
something, Dunn added.
Recent 2008 creative writing 
graduate Katie Fulton took a job 
with Teppers new program after 
finding that, in times of economic 
difficulty, few people are look
ing for new manuscripts. When 
she heard about the opportuni
ties available within Tepper, she 
hesitantly applied for one of the 
positions.
At first I thought that working 
at Tepper would have to be a last 
resort. And then I hit rock-bottom 
and realized I had to apply, Ful
ton said. Now I spend my days 
scrubbing those giant photos of 
smiling graduates. It is a little 
sickening, sort of like shining the 
image of what I have failed to be
come. Actually, exactly like that. 
However, not all see the posi
tions as such dismal alternatives 
to jobs off campus.
I love my job, said 2006 de
sign graduate Steven Hammon. 
I have the opportunity to tie the 
loafers of future CEOs and presi
dents. I mean, what more could 
you want? In fact, I hope that 
they make this position a perma
nent one, even after the economy 
changes.
No word yet on how long Tep
per will continue to offer positions 
to graduates, but all students can 
be comforted by the fact that, as 
long as Tepper continues to give 
diplomas, there will always be the 
need for a reliable shoe shine.

NSF cancels all grant allocations Gossip Geek at CMU
MICHAEL KAHN
Ex-SciTech Editor
In a surprise announcement 
yesterday, the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) released its 
grant schedule for the 2011 fis
cal year. The agency normally 
allocates $4 billion to distribute 
to researchers around the coun
try, and many Carnegie Mellon 
professors commonly apply for 
NSF grants. The NSF is one of 
our primary sources of project 
funding. Most of our operating 
budget, and my stipend, come 
from the NSF, said James Fisher, 
a graduate student in chemistry, 
before the announcement.
To Fisher and many others
 dismay, the NSF announced that 
it would not be allowing appli
cations for any grants for 2011.
After lengthy deliberations, we 
decided it was just really hard 
to give out all that money, NSF 
Director Arden Bement Jr. said.' 
Instead, all $4 billion will be 
used to buy Fiji, which will be 
renamed Utopia. Utopia will be 
a paradise of science, with the 
laws of thermodynamics as a ba
sis for the judiciary, according to 
Bement.
Though Utopia may be a 
haven for antisocial scientists 
worldwide, some in the academic 
community are not pleased. Car
negie Mellon Vice President for 
Research Richard McCullough 
criticized the NSF, claiming, 
This decision will put America 
behind in science and technol
ogy. He added that this was 
because all the scientists would 
leave America.
While many scientists we 
talked to were concerned about 
the absence of NSF grants in 
their continued quest for tenure, 
others were excited about the 
opportunities in Utopia. Can
dace McMaster, a Utopia-invited 
cellular biologist, said, The re
search equipment they showed 
in the presentation today does 
seem to be the highest quality 
in the world; however, I am not 
sure who will staff the local Star
bucks.
Senior researcher Madeline 
Huhtamok had even higher ex
pectations for Utopia, letting The 
Tartan know she hoped it is go
ing to turn out just like that mov
ie with the blue people, except 
not the part where they log the 
whole thing and try to kill every
one. That movie was great.
Doomsday Clock becomes digital
DYLAN MORI
Atomic Scientist
Considering the amount of 
fear in the world today, it is no 
wonder that the Apocalypse is on 
many peoples minds. On the top 
of the list of potential disasters 
are nuclear war, natural disaster, 
disease, and future elections. To 
account for the rise in world de
struction pre-planning, scientists 
have renovated the design of the 
Doomsday Clock, moving from 
the face-and-hands model of the 
1950s into the digital era of to
day.
The Doomsday Clock was 
first created by scientists follow
ing the dropping of the atomic 
bomb on Japan in 1945. It dis
played a countdown until mid
night  the point of global 
atomic warfare. Over the years, 
the clock has been reset multiple 
times, and it currently is set at six 
minutes to midnight.
Chairperson of the Bulletin 
of the Atomic Scientists Matthias 
Killa said: The digital Doomsday 
Clock will do away with such un
refined representation. The new 
clock will not only record chang
es in the worldwide nuclear situ
ation down to the femtosecond, 
but it will also have an alarm set
to go off whenever the world has 
been too peaceful for too long. 
There are rumors that it will also 
glow in the dark.
In recent years, said clock 
designer Phyllis Yee, there have 
been many new threats that we 
need to account for. The clock 
is simply a more refined way to 
track... everything. Calculat
ing the distance to Armageddon 
obviously is largely influenced 
by the ongoing threat of nuclear 
war. However, other variables in
cluded in the new clock are inter
national peace levels, the current 
approval rating of the American 
President, disease rates, ongoing 
military conflicts, number of liv
ing scientists, number of whales 
saved yearly, rate of incoming 
browser crash reports because 
of Flash plug-ins, number of 
people who think the current 
Homeland Security threat level 
is orange, speed of a Toyota car 
when it wont stop, number of 
people currently on board the 
International Space Station, rate 
of volcanic eruptions in Iceland, 
number of licks to the center of a 
Tootsie Pop, number of children 
currently scared by monsters in 
their closets, number of people 
who think the current Homeland 
Security threat level is yellow,
duration of sunspots, length of 
Pinocchios nose, current play
ers on EVE, whether or not Punxsutawney Phil most recently saw 
his shadow, decibels of drunken
ness on Brooklyns streets, count 
of remaining LOST candidates, 
ratio of Team Edward to Team Ja
cob member^, veracity of Apple 
fanboys for the iPad, number of 
people who dont know the cur
rent Homeland Security threat 
level, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber album sales, and a few others 
that Yee thought she might have 
forgotten.
Variable inclusion has been a 
contentious process. Theologians 
suggest more information focus
ing on, among other things, the 
number of sinners in the world 
and the validity of prior rapture 
predictions. Secularists, on the 
other hand, voted on a single 
quotient that weighed only the 
existence of God. The fight is ex
pected to be long and dubious.
While there has not been a 
release date announced for the 
digital Doomsday Clock, tenta
tively named Doomsday Clock: 
Forever, it will launch before De
cember 2012. Killa added, We 
want to make sure it works, and 
think that would just be the most 
perfect test.

Teen heartthrob Gilbert Worthington IV stars in The CWs Gossip Geek.
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports & TV Editor
Spotted: The CW announcing 
their latest project, Gossip Geek, 
modeled after their popular teen 
fantasy series, Gossip Girl Who 
knew that beneath their disarm
ing exterior, dungeon masters 
and engineers alike could be so 
scandalous? Rumor has it sex, 
drugs, and more sex run ram
pant behind (well, mostly on) 
their computer screens.
According to Executive Cre
ative Director Terri Bleideas, the 
series will follow seven students 
who are geeky, antisocial, and 
relatively below the population 
average of attractiveness, but 
very intelligent.
She also said that a hip set
ting, such as New York in the 
previous series, wasnt neces
sary as geeks are not expected to 
venture into the real world basi
cally ever.
It started out as a joke, to 
make the complete opposite of 
what the characters on Gossip

 excuse me, explore  a very 
non-stereotypical group of peo

what relevance I have in a show

Recession hits Oxford comma diesSonic wave thing occurs, 
campus glass shattersJ. ELI0T DEGOLIA
Official Tartan Grammarian
At an executive meeting last 
Thursday Oxford University Press 
decided to no longer require 
punctuation in their published 
works
Because of the high price of 
publishing punctuation becomes 
'expensive especially during 
these difficult. economic times 
said Oxford publisher Perry Udd 
Omitting punctuation from books 
and articles would save about 3 
percent of the resources used to 
publish items including printing 
paper and ink
Possibly the most controversial 
implication is the retraction of the 
Oxford comma The convention 
is used after the penultimate 
item in a written list Udd claims
that commas make up over 40 
percent of punctuation in the 
English language more so in the 
pieces we publish This would 
have serious implications when 
considering our budget Removing 
commas especially the Oxford 
kind would also compromise 
the comprehensibility of a text 
Without them lists of items 
would be ambiguously related to 
each other For example Nelson 
Mandela could be accidentally 
referred to as an 800 year old 
demigod and a dildo collector 
Thats what Peter Ustinov did 
in his documentary film Planet 
Ustinov
Another thing to consider 
with these cuts is the cost of 
copy editing added Udd Since 
there are fewer standards of 
style sans punctuation we can
hire a less expensive copy staff 
In fact according to a recent 
Oxford study most copy errors 
that happen deal with clarifying 
ambiguities with punctuation 
Udd continued This is a waste of 
time but the simpler procedure 
could expedite the production 
process
A copy editor from Oxford 
agreed Our readers will figure 
it out Besides it will make 
them smarter by exercising 
their critical thinking skills We 
all know that every sentence 
begins with a capital letter all 
possessive pronouns precede a 
noun questions have question 
words or special syntax and 
clauses can be intuitively 
deciphered Right I mean theres 
no punctuation in speech

Plan for permanent tents pitched by university administration
Patrick Gage Kelley/Tent Artist
AMANDA COLE
Grandma Pillbox
The tents at the Fence might 
have started out as a G-20 protest, 
but they provided the administra
tion with unexpected inspiration 
and a solution for the housing 
problem.
Last Tuesday, Kelly Coleman, 
director of Alternative Campus 
Housing, announced that the 
university has decided to erect 
permanent tents. We want to ac
commodate as many students as 
possible, and maybe even provide 
housing for some grad students, 
so weve decided to extend the 
tent housing plan onto the entire
ty of the Cut. Were also thinking 
about converting the Morewood 
Gardens parking lot into tent 
housing. We feel that this is a step 
in the right direction, she said.
The university plans to have 
these new tents erected by fall 
with the hope that students who
didnt make the cut during room While many, like Greene, supselection will be able to live on port the new tent dorms, most

is being lauded as the greenest plan hasnt really been thought

CMU steroid ring uncovered; teams maintain abysmal, expected records
COURTNEY CHIN
Scared of Athletes
A group of students normally 
known as organized and relative
ly well behaved, the model stu
dent athletes of Carnegie Mellon 
have been hit by a scandal.
The Carnegie Mellon police 
departments excellent sleuthing 
has recently uncovered a steroid 
ring within the athletics depart
ment that involves most of the 
varsity sports teams.
Student athletes have sunk to 
an unethical level in the compa
ny of the infamous Barry Bonds 
and Mark McGwire, even at our 
average-performing Division III 
school.
Although evidence is still be
ing uncovered, it appears that 
the culprits were not only in
volved in several popular sports, 
but also the mens curling team 
and the cheerleading team.
Max Rodriguez, chief of Carn
egie Mellons police department, 
released a statement yesterday 
afternoon. I didnt even know 
we had a curling team, he said, 
but we are still investigating 
where the drugs came from and 
how the teams got funding in the 
first place, considering most, if 
not all, of alumni donations go 
to research teaching robots how 
to blink.
"The second half of the state
ment released by the police

department said, Disciplinary 
action will not be pursued in 
the case of the teams involved. 
Upon further investigation, it 
turns out the teams on average 
had a winning-to-losing ratio of 
1:3.
Susie Baskin, director of ath
letics, did not respond to any of 
eight different phone calls from 
various members from our staff.
A male athlete, who wished 
to remain anonymous, said, We 
were told it was an organic, fair
trade Ceylon cinnamon grounds 
and flax seed body rub. Ill admit 
that the heavenly scent of cin
namon may have distracted me 
from seeing the ball properly, but 
steroids? Thats news to me.
Randomly polled students
on campus were also surprised 
to learn that sports teams even 
existed, besides the chess and 
Buggy teams.
For the mens curling team, 
disciplinary action is yet to be 
announced. They were polled 
to be seventh of eight teams in 
the BALCO league, and ended up 
getting eighth, Gren Anderson, 
the temporary double-interim 
dean of Student Affairs, stated. 
As for the other teams, Im not 
sure what punishment is appro
priate. One teams season record 
was 1-17, with the single win 
being against a team that had to 
forfeit because their school was 
snowed in. I think their terrible 
results are enough of a punish
ment.
Former football players 
declare war, begin 
battle of the fabrics
WILLIAM MUELLER
Special Historian
There are many reasons 
why Carnegie Mellon studentathletes quit the Tartan football 
team. Some quit in order to pur
sue academic interests; others 
tire of the long, drawn-out prac
tices.
Whatever the reason may be, 
these athletes still hold on to the 
memories of hearing the roar of 
their 30 fans at Gesling Stadium 
or lose sleep over the lingering 
feeling of Coach Makrinos sa
liva on their face. And now, in 
the spirit of recapturing their 
former glory, 42 retired football 
players have organized a new 
team  the Carnegie Mellon 
Argyles.
Derek Smaertguy, a former 
Tartan player and the appointed 
team Reader of the Argyles, has 
issued this decree: We, the Car
negie Mellon Argyles, have as
sembled a group of former CMU 
football players who have the 
athletic ability and sculpted pec
torals to defeat the Tartans in a 
game of American football. We 
therefore challenge the Carne
gie Mellon Tartans to a game on 
Thursday, April 1, at 4:20 p.m. 
to lay claim to the official title of 
the schools football team.
The statement continues, ex
pressing the Argyles demands 
that if they were to emerge vic
torious from such a competition, 
all Carnegie Mellon football 
home games would be played 
exclusively by the Argyles... un
less there is homework due the 
next day.
School officials are still con
sulting over the teams request. 
When approached for an inter
view, Tartans head coach Rick 
Lackner provided no comment.
There has been speculation 
on all fronts concerning who 
would coach the Argyles if such 
a game were to occur. Many 
names have surfaced, but lead
ing the rumor mill is Assistant 
Director of Intramurals Mike 
Grzywinski.
A quick look into Grzywinksis professional coach
ing background reveals that he 
won NCAA Tournament bracket 
pools 11 out of 13 years in office, 
is a closet addict of the popular 
video game NCAA Football 10, 
and had a history of playing 
dirty while he was an intramu
ral athlete.
Grzywinksi has also been 
seen sporting a pair of argyle 
socks around campus the past 
few days, a possible sign of 
things to come.
Barbie finds work doing odd jobs: tutoring, selling her body
PRERNAAGARWAL
Plastic Enthusiast
If you saw her you would nev
er guess.
Our conventional image of a 
Carnegie Mellon computer sci
ence major is a short dork in 
glasses who has no idea how to 
begin a conversation. But this girl 
I know is tall, fit, extremely at
tractive, and an amazing speaker. 
And a prostitute.
I had been struggling with
advanced programming and I 
needed a tutor; she needed a tutee and some quick cash. Walk
ing into Hunt Library I saw her, a 
lady who seemed very focused on 
her education; that is, focused on 
her education during the day, and 
spending evenings trolling Craigslist and street corners.
She was a great tutor, motivat
ing and truly inspiring. Then one 
day, I was in the South Side when 
I saw my tutor standing on the 
street in a short, frilly, lacy black
dress with high heels on. Her 
face was caked with makeup and 
fire-alarm-red lipstick. For days 
I wondered if it was possible  
could my tutor actually be selling 
her body?
I hadnt believed the rumors 
until she confessed her story to 
me. She told me that there were 
many men on the Internet, some 
dying to have her pretend to be 
their classic, college girlfriend, 
most just wanting sex, and some 
fat and ugly who could never look
at a woman any other way. She 
gave me the names of boys on 
campus that bought her services, 
but these details are private. If I 
shared these it would be a scan
dal. She said she worked as a 
prostitute because the university 
is expensive and the bills need 
to be covered. She claimed that 
there were at lfeast a hundred girls 
like her on campus  each hiding 
her secret and her client list from 
the others. The reality is that 
prostitution still exists as one of
the most popular career choices, 
even if its sidelined to the dark 
corners of society. But if you see 
that six-foot-tall, gorgeous girl 
with the 39-inch bust  dont be 
surprised, she might be offering 
you services in programming or 
pleasure.
Her name was Barbie, and 
while they might portray her be
tween sheets of cardboard as a 
plastic computer engineer, now 
you know that she doesnt just 
have a day job.

Department of Organized Relationships to open doors in fall
JESSE KUMMER
Personnel Manager
With the recent creation of 
the Department of Organized 
Relationships (DOOR), you can 
expect to see a lot less ogling and 
drooling and a whole lot more 
awkward first dates and handholding across campus. DOOR is 
expected to begin doing work this 
coming fall  just in time if you 
ask me, since the class of 2014 is 
looking like one of the least-attractive groups to come through 
Carnegie Mellon in years, clearly 
an impressive feat.
This brand spankin  and I 
mean the naughty kind  new 
department will lead the fight 
against virginity on campus by
matching students based on a 
whole bunch of dimensions of 
personalities most of you didnt 
even know you had. All of the 
best and worst traits for every 
student on campus will be kept in 
safe-like, yet unlocked, desks and 
drawers in a room under surveil
lance. Using all this highly sensi
tive and not-so-well protected 
information, DOOR will try to 
match students as best they can
 but you must remember that 
for some special people, there 
just is no hope.
The organizations stated 
agenda includes many fine goals 
such as reducing the sales of 
the Sex Kills... Come to CMU 
and Live Forever T-shirts by at 
least 50-percent, increasing the
amount of cuddling by 25 per
cent, and boldly stating that they 
hope to decrease the time spent 
in clusters by 1 percent.
When told of the latter goal, 
junior computer science major 
Nerdsome McGoo said, Just you 
wait, the Final Fantasy XN beta 
launches tomorrow. Ill never 
surrender to the female horde! 
before wheezing and beginning a 
high-pitched maniacal laugh that 
continued for seven of the most 
awkward minutes of my life.
Despite this virgins attitude, 
there is plenty of potential for 
the new department to be a suc
cess, even in such a black hole for 
love as Carnegie Mellon. Already 
there seem to be signs of change 
on campus.
For example, at the ribboncutting ceremony in front of the 
newly named Grope Hall, two un
identified students immediately 
began making out, right in front 
both of DOORs nev/ly appointed 
deans: the Dean of Attractive Stu
dents and the Dean of Unattract
ive Students. The crowd broke 
into to oohs and aahs, as if theyd 
never before seen lips make con
tact with lips. The Dean of Unat
tractive Students, Anna Lovely, 
shouted, Those are my kids! 
while the Dean of Attractive Stu
dents shielded her eyes from that 
display of ugly love.
And dont be upset if your ini
tial arranged relationship isnt 
exactly up to your standards  
besides, you should have thrown
any standards away as soon as 
you walked onto this campus. 
DOOR will be offering students 
18 arranged meet-ups per semes
ter, with serial rejectees eventu
ally being sent for likability work
shops and community service in 
desolate areas.
As a stopgap measure while 
DOOR continues to fully imple
ment the DOOR Matching sys
tem planned for the fall, the two 
deans have partnered with The 
Tartan to begin providing space 
to print personal ads for students 
who just cant wait that long. 
Lovely believed this program 
should start immediately, so with 
her deanly approval, we present 
to you our first installment of 
DOOR personal ads:

shouldnt really be in college but 
I skipped two grades because my 
mom told me I am special wants 
to experience life. Has been told 
that to do this should have girl

but mom said that doesnt count.

my intellect, which is quite large. 
But dont be large in person, I am 
pretty small, being only 15 and 
having stunted growth.
SWAMP FROG
Green guy looking for pink 
gal. You should be flirty, very 
fierce, and a little plump. Your

be Miss Piggy. Under the blankets 
our animalistic muppetty sides 
will take over.
APOLOGY
Once we were in love. Once we 
were spending every minute to
gether, we would smile, we would 
stare into each others eyes. We 
were a fairy tale. And then there 
was that situation with the iron, 
the Ethernet cable, and your cat, 
and I cant apologize enough for 
what happened, but does it have 
to end this way?
COFFEE TO GO
You made me a drink at Star
bucks. I looked into your eyes, 
three times. You looked back. 
Your name was Will and I was 
wearing a green sweatshirt. I 
have returned to Starbucks each 
day since then, but it seems you 
dont actually work there. This 
and the Internet both confuse 
me, thus my missed connection 
is being written in a spot where 
personal ads go. Not on Craiglist 
because I dont know what that is. 
Find me.
RESEARCH ASSISTANT

team seeks young attractive grad
uate student for research. Activi
ties may include: laboratory ex
perimentation, Chatroulette user

on the beach.
GREEK LUST

fraternities. We are a top univer
sity hoping to fill our Greek quad 
with a set of intentionally selected 
fraternities that are right for our 
campus environment. Fraterni
ties with foci on vegans, Internet 
meme-spreading, anti-social be
havior, and anything that doesnt 
involve parties with alcohol 
would be just great.
INFOGRAPHIC ALU ST
Bar chart seeks line graph to 
smooth out my corners. Ideally 
data-rich and chart-junk-light. 
You will find me on page one 
where we can cuddle up together 
above my credit. No pie chart fat
ties need apply.
WANDERING BARD
Voice major seeks anyone 
who is willing to stand within 15 
feet as I blast showtunes walking 
through campus. Knowledg^ of 
Italian, French, or Latin a plus. 
Ability to harmonize will be con
sidered upon audition. Male, fe
male, anything with a good noise 
tolerance is welcome to respond. 
Auditions for groupies and long
term relationships will be held on 
sidewalks around campus on the 
next sunny day.

Cabin on the Cut revealed as silent memorial to architects
HARRISON APPLE
Master Planner
November 2009, if youll cast 
your minds back through time, 
is when we might have first no
ticed the eruption from the Cut 
of a small house-like structure. In 
the tranquility of smooth green 
gratis, a cottage of odd aroma and 
form emerged partially from the 
ground, peeking out at the world 
around it.
Little did we know that this 
quiet structure was one of our last
reminders of the previous years 
fallen architecture students, re
cently found in the Monongahela River. Police have reported 
that the groundwater pushed 
the bodies from the site into the 
river channels, where they were 
found with a look of disappoint
ment and a final review clutched 
in their fists.
These students had fallen into 
a stressful vortex, described as a 
labyrinth of T-squares and cof
fee cups. The one surviving wit
ness who fled the department,
now hiding in Homewood and 
wishing to remain anonymous, 
relayed his experiences of escap
ing this swift and disastrous fate: 
As I was kicking one of the plot
ters into working order the night 
before our review, I heard what I 
thought was a performance piece 
gone awry on the third floor. 
Unknown to this former stu
dent, the collective stress of CFA 
had formed a quantum spiritualmagnetic connection to a crypt 
that had been forgotten since the 
days of Andrew Carnegie, 300
feet under Carnegie Mellons Cut, 
resulting in a small yet disastrous 
tectonic plate shift.
The poplar windows of our 
hall were ripped from the side of 
CFA, coincidentally forming the 
most beautiful semi-detached 
structure I could imagine, and 
as I sketched it with a segment
ed arch to impress that girl who 
sleeps next to me under our clus
ter tables, I watched her fly out 
of the conical intersect.... I never 
returned her protractor.
Fortunately, our witness slam
med his ribs between a fallen 
transom bar and a canyon of in
efficiently used materials, saving 
his life. Were he not so lucky, his 
body, mind, and soul would have 
passed through a hellish obstacle 
course culminating in the deep 
soil of Pittsburghs watershed.
Let us all take a moment now 
to bask in the recent sunshine, 
showering an ominous glow and 
twinkling silent memorial on 
the metal stakes that still mark 
their point of departure from this 
plane.
