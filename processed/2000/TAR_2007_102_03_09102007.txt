America wasnt built on 
Wall Street. America was 
built by men and women who 
worked with their backs and 
their hands.
That was the message presi
dential candidate and former 
senator John Edwards (D-N.C.) 
delivered to Pittsburgh as he 
accepted the endorsement of 
the United Steelworkers and 
the United Mine Workers of 
America last Monday at the 
Mellon Arena.
The son of a mill worker, Ed
wards has taken up the cause 
of the middle class. After los
ing the race for vice-president
in 2004, Edwards dedicated 
himself to fighting poverty, 
globetrotting to places like In
dia and China, and marching 
alongside workers in over 200 
picket lines around the U.S. 
Last October, Edwards joined 
a United Steelworkers (USW) 
strike of a Goodyear plant, 
demonstrating solidarity with 
their cause.
[Edwards] never once men
tioned politics or his quest for 
the presidency, USW President 
Leo Girard said of Edwardss 
participation in the strike.
It was with the same popu
list spirit that he decided to 
make his entrance to the USW 
event from behind the crowd, 
as opposed to coming from 
backstage, the preference of
many politicians.
Sporting jeans and a navy 
USW jacket, Edwards stood 
before a mass of current and 
retired steelworkers, all of 
them burly and some wearing 
the colored shirt of their local 
union. He drew on his cam
paigns focal points of universal 
health care and labor rights for 
all Americans.
The United Mine Workers of 
America (UMWA) also chose to 
endorse Edwards.
UMWA made their choice 
despite Edwards recent an
nouncement that as president, 
he would not allow any new 
coal plants to be built without 
carbon capture technologies

Carnegie Mellon students 
found themselves between a 
rock and a dry place after a water 
main near the Heron Hill water 
pumping station at the corner 
of Centre Avenue and North Dithridge Street in Oakland burst 
around 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, 
Aug. 30. Many campus buildings, 
as well as off-campus Oakland 
apartments, were either with
out water or had very low water 
pressure.
Carnegie Mellon got word 
of the break at about 2:30 p.m. 
from the Pittsburgh Water and 
Sewer Authority, according to 
Marty Altschul, university en
gineer and director of Facilities 
Management Services (FMS). 
Since the universitys water sup
ply is dependent on the citys, 
there was nothing that univer
sity personnel could do directly 
to repair the line.
It was a break in their line, 
not ours, Altschul said.
Altschul assigned different 
groups of personnel, including 
residence life staff, university 
police, and FMS members, to 
assess water flow in different
campus buildings. Carnegie 
Mellon is served by the Heron 
Hill reservoir as well as the 
Highland Park reservoir, and 
while the university is aware of 
which buildings are served by 
each reservoir, there are cross 
valves between the reservoirs so 
personnel can never be certain 
where the water for each build
ing is coming from at any given 
time.
Since the water and sewer 
systems work partially based 
on gravity, the buildings that 
experienced the lowest wa
ter pressure were those at the

This school year, Carnegie 
Mellon students and faculty 
members have two new trans
portation options. Two national 
hourly rental car companies, 
Flexcar and Zipcar, recently 
opened shop in Pittsburgh, 
offering all-inclusive hourly 
car rental services to local 
residents.
To use Flexcars vehicles, cus
tomers must be at least 21 years 
of age. Zipcar has a special con
tract with Carnegie Mellon that 
allows the company to offer use 
of their vehicles to students as 
young as 18.
To use Flexcar or Zipcar, stu
dents must create a membership 
on the companies respective 
pages, Flexcar.com and Zipcar. 
com. Both companies require 
a $35 initiation fee. Currently, 
Zipcar is running a promotion 
for students in which the ini
tiation fee is turned into rental 
credit for the customer.
We partnered with the uni
versity in order to have the 
cars on campus, said Zipcar 
spokesperson Adam Brophy. 
The university provides the 
parking spaces. They help with 
promotion and we discount the 
service.
Even without a contract 
with Carnegie Mellon, Flex
car shows much potential to 
solve students transportation 
problems.
Three years ago, Seattle 
University was one of the first 
markets in which Flexcar be
gan operations.
Technical difficulties with hundreds 
of graduate student votes prompted the 
GSA to vote against the election results. 
Although Student Senate unanimously 
approved the results, both groups must 
agree before the winners can take office.
The void is effective only for the ex
ecutive board of the student government, 
which includes the student body presi
dent (SBP), student body vice president 
(SBVP), and student body vice president 
of finance (SBVPF). Positions for Student
Senate were approved by both Senate and 
the GSA.
If the election results had been declared 
valid, Weinstock and Jain would have 
taken office, beating Colin Sternhell, se
nior economics and business major, and 
Lauren Hudock, senior public policy and 
management and philosophy major, by 19 
votes. Joel Bergstein, senior mechanical 
engineering and engineering and pub
lic policy major, would have been named 
SBVPF, having won by 182 votes.

On Thursday, the Graduate Student As
sembly (GSA) failed to ratify the results 
of last weeks election, which would have 
declared Sean Weinstock, senior political 
science and business major, and Adi Jain, 
senior electrical and computer engineer
ing and business major, as student body 
president and vice president, respectively.
I really think we would have benefited 
the campus by letting Sean and Adi take 
over now, Sternhell said. It seems like a 
better alternative to waiting almost two 
more weeks to install a new president 
when they could be doing things now. 
Elections began as planned Monday 
at 7 p.m. Starting that night, the Elec
tions Board received 15 complaint emails, seven of which were from graduate

Second bomb threat of the semester hits campus
Hunt study rooms open
New group study rooms 
opened in the basement of 
Hunt Library on Thursday. Each 
room contains a large table and 
chairs, two white boards, glass 
outer walls, and its own door. 
Students reported that hav
ing the rooms eliminated the 
frustration of groups trying to 
meet on designated quiet floors, 
where they may be a disruption 
to other students, or the Maggie 
Murph Caf, which can be noisy 
and distracting for students try
ing to work. The university is 
planning to add similar rooms 
in the Engineering & Science 
Library on the fourth floor of 
Wean Hall.
The Library Transformation
Project, which began in July, is 
still underway. The University 
is switching its cataloging from 
the Dewey Decimal System to 
the Library of Congress system 
to match the organization of 
non-college-affiliated libraries. 
Under the Library of Congress 
system, books will be shelved 
near others with similar topics 
and the call numbers on each 
item will include the publication 
year to more clearly distinguish 
between editions.
The transformation of the 
Engineering & Science Library 
has been completed; Hunt 
Library is currently undergoing 
re-labeling in stacks-2 and the 
basement collections.
Another bomb threat on campus
On Tuesday at 2:42 p.m., 
University Police responded to 
another e-mailed bomb threat. 
Although the threat was sent 
Saturday, Sept. 1, the e-mail was 
not discovered until classes re
sumed after Labor Day weekend. 
The threat stated that the bomb 
was located in Whitfield Hall, 
an administrative building on 
North Craig Street owned by 
the university. The threat also 
mentioned that another bomb 
in a brown paper bag would 
be placed on the outdoor cam
pus but did not give a specific 
location.
The campus community was 
alerted to the situation around 
3:30 p.m. Tuesday. University
Police soon evacuated Whitfield 
Hall. After thoroughly searching 
the building and the outdoor 
campus, University Police found 
no evidence of suspicious or 
dangerous devices.
By 4:40 p.m., Whitfield Hall 
had been reopened and the cam
pus community was notified that 
both locations had been deemed 
safe.
The FBI is currently investi
gating the threat, according to a 
Sept. 5 article on KDKA Newss 
website. There have been 12 
other similar threats made at 
universities all over the country. 
All threats involved bombs and 
were received by university per
sonnel via e-mail. While federal
agents have not yet deter
mined if the cases are related, 
because the threats were sent 
electronically, there is a high 
probability that agents will 
be able to trace them to the 
sender, the article indicated.
Students, faculty, and staff 
were notified of the threat 
through e-mail messages, 
notes posted on the univer
sitys homepage, and the 
AlertNow system.

Port Authority reduces bus service by 10 percent
by Maria Zayas
Staffwriter
On Sunday, Sept. 2, the Port 
Authority of Allegheny County 
reduced its service by an ad
ditional 10 percent in hopes of 
dissipating some of the compa
nys $80 million budget deficit 
for the current fiscal year, which 
began on July 1.
The reduction was the second 
of three phases of change. The 
first phase, which went into effect 
on June 17, reduced service by 15 
percent, eliminating 30 regu
lar routes. These changes were 
minor compared to the original 
proposal made in January, which 
would have cut service by 25 per
cent and eliminated 124 routes.
However, the Port Authority 
found that phase one alone was 
insufficient for regulating bud
get deficiencies, and decided 
to implement phase two of the 
plan. If the additional decrease 
is not effective enough, the Port 
Authority will move on to phase 
three, which will increase the 
fares on certain routes via one 
of two current proposals. One 
proposal would increase the 
base fare from the current $1.75 
to $2.50 while keeping the zone 
structure. The other proposal
would have all riders pay a flat $2 
fare. If the Port Authority deems 
it necessary, phase three will go 
into effect Jan. 1, 2008. The Port 
Authority has not yet decided 
which routes will be affected.
Even before the cuts, the re
liability of the transportation 
system was regarded unfavor
ably by some Carnegie Mellon 
students.
My experience with the buses 
has been almost completely 
unreliable, said Kyri Baker, a 
sophomore in electrical and com
puter engineering. The only bus 
that seems to actually follow its 
schedule in my experience has 
been the 28X. My friends and I 
have waited for almost an hour 
for the 59U to pick us up, and I 
think the 61 buses only seem 
more reliable because there are 
more of them. [It] makes even 
small trips like going to Squir
rel Hill take much longer than 
necessary.
Christine Park, a sophomore 
economics major, agrees.
[The Port Authoritys] unre
liability wastes a chunk of my 
day, Park said. It really is an 
inconvenience because I have 
to set aside two to three extra 
hours for transportation. I also 
dont support any further cuts in 
the public transportation depart
ment because its bad as it is.
Those who will be most af
fected are residents of certain 
sections of Allegheny County that 
will lose all public transportation, 
and areas such as Brookline and 
Troy that have lost most of their 
routes, according to Amanda 
Zeiders of Save Our Transit, a 
non-profit organization working 
to eliminate service cuts. Many 
workers and families, some of 
whom cannot afford their own 
vehicles, depend on the public 
transportation system, Zeiders 
said. Others find taking the bus 
a better and more cost-effective 
alternative to the expensive and 
hard-to-find parking available 
downtown.
However, the Port Authority 
estimates that the new plans will 
result in a projected rider loss of 
only 4 percent, according to its 
website.
Part of the Port Authoritys 
financial trouble may be due 
to lavish management peiks 
that caused a $28 million pen
sion plan deficit, according to 
a March 24 article in the Pitts
burgh Tribune-Review. In July, 
Port Authority CEO Steve Bland 
responded to the allegations by 
implementing radical changes 
in managerial policies, including 
the elimination of lifetime
healthcare benefits and 56 staff 
positions, and the freezing of the 
salaries of senior management, 
including his own.
Some riders, such as members 
of Save Our Transit, have taken it 
upon themselves to secure alter
nate funding, in fear that their 
own routes will be cut next.
Save Our Transit believes that 
workers and riders alone should 
not have to pay the price for 
Port Authoritys poor funding. 
The group is now working hard 
to secure funding from local 
authorities.
Right now were working 
on getting dedicated funding, 
Zeiders said. Were very close to 
getting it. The state has agreed 
to give some dedicated fund
ing, but unless local authorities 
match their funding, we wont 
get any funding.
A public hearing to discuss 
the possibility of alternatives 
and local funding for the public 
transportation system will be 
held Tuesday, Oct. 2 at 5 p.m. 
at 436 Grant St. in Downtown. 
In order to speak at the hearing, 
participants must preregister by 
calling Job Mascio, the county 
clerk, at (412) 350-5636 or

Flexcar provides members of 
our community the same free
dom associated with a personal
car without them having to bring 
their vehicle to campus, said 
Mark Melnack, director of trans
portation services at Seattle 
University.
Depending on the car, Flexcars 
hourly rental rates range from $6 
to $11. Zipcar offers an hourly 
rate of $7 for all of its vehicles. 
Both companies rates include 
insurance and gas fees.
Users can search and reserve 
cars by location or model type 
via the companies websites.
One-third of Flexcars fleet is 
hybrid. The entire fleet consists 
of a Mini Cooper, Toyota Corol
las, a minivan, and a Toyota 
Tacoma truck. Zipcar has a Toy
ota Prius hybrid and a Mazda 3 
sedan available for customers 
use.
Near the Carnegie Mellon 
campus, Flexcar has one park
ing space located on Devon Road 
in Oakland, two on the corner 
of Forbes Avenue and Margaret 
Morrison Street, three on Forbes 
Avenue near the University of
Pittsburgh, and one on Meyran 
Avenue in Oakland.
Zipcars two parking spaces 
are located in Carnegie Mellons 
East Campus Garage.
Both companies plan to 
expand the number of cars 
available to students.
When we start to add cars, 
we will work with the school 
and survey our members to see 
what kind of cars they want on 
campus, Brophy said.
Flexcar has similar expansion 
plans.
We started with 20 cars and 
added 10 more. Now, we are 
expanding and we are going to 
be reaching other areas besides 
Downtown and Oakland, said 
Jenna Cox, director of market
ing at Flexcar.

that reduce carbon emissions 
significantly. He pledged to put 
at least a billion dollars into 
the development and imple
mentation of carbon capture.
The actual cost of the 
primary research and 
development tasks for car
bon capture is projected to 
be between $8 to $10 billion, 
according to Howard Herzog, 
a researcher on MITs The 
Future of Coal study. In addi
tion, experts such as Herzog, 
along with the Department 
of Energy (DOE), have deter
mined that carbon capture 
plants wont materialize for 
at least a decade, a long wait 
for mine workers and their 
families.
Edwards made the case 
against sending jobs overseas 
in his stump speech. The men
tion of Bushs name led to a 
round of boos from the steel
workers, as Edwards vowed 
to prioritize the middle class 
and unions over corporations. 
Nobody will be able to walk 
through that picket line and 
take your job away fronl you, 
he said.
Many Carnegie Mellon 
students plan to wdrk in the 
high-tech field, where jobs are 
less threatened. In contrast, 
increasing trade and global
ization proves more of a threat 
for manufacturing unions. The 
AFL-CIO, the largest represen
tative of unionized workers in 
the U.S., maintains the country 
has lost more than 2.5 million 
manufacturing jobs since
2001.
The USW, which claims a 
membership of 1.2 million, is 
mostly concentrated in Penn
sylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, 
and Kentucky, none of them 
early battleground states in 
the primary election. Still, the 
Edwards campaign maintains 
their value.
A candidates strength in 
those states  their ability to 
mobilize  is going to be enor
mously important, Edwardss 
wife Elizabeth told The Tartan. 
Electability is an issue every 
place.
Most of Edwardss resources 
are concentrated in Iowa, 
where he holds a five-point 
lead over Hillary Clinton, ac
cording to an Aug. 26 poll by 
Time magazine.

that time.
Once aware of the error, the 
Elections Board instated a new 
list of eligible voters, and elec
tronic access was given to the af
fected graduate students at 10:30 
p.m. Tuesday night.
To accommodate the elec
tronic error, paper ballots were 
supplied at Wean Commons and 
in front of Doherty Hall. The vot
ing deadline was also extended 
to Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. to 
allow for the requisite 24-hour 
electronic voting time.
But seriously, who is going to 
do that? Egelman asked. This is 
effectively a poll tax on graduate 
students; if you want to vote, you 
must make the trek across cam
pus to do so.
I had no idea the election was 
going on, or where to go to vote, 
said James Rosen, a computer sci
ence graduate student. When I 
sent an e-mail to the election com
missioner, I got an e-mail saying I 
could come vote by paper ballot. I 
was in meetings during the hours 
they listed as being open for pa
per ballots, so in the end, I never 
was able to submit my votes.
There were 140 votes placed 
by graduate students, less than 
14 percent of the 1019 students 
who voted. In the 2006 election, 
1200 students voted, 26 percent 
of which were graduate students.
Only students who were eligi
ble to vote last spring could cast
their votes. First-year undergrad
uate and graduate students were 
not eligible to participate.
Last springs departing under
graduates, graduate students, 
and fall study abroad students 
were encouraged to cast paper 
ballots provided to them last 
May. Those votes were included
in last weeks election results.
Last weeks election attempt 
was the universitys third. After 
the initial date of of April 9, the 
elections were postponed two 
weeks to April 24. The April 24 
election was invalidated after it 
began due to perceived tampering
of the online voting sy stem. Elec
tions were then postponed until 
September.
Last spring, I successfully 
voted in the online election, then 
found out the results were later 
invalidated, said Rosen. I knew 
the elections were going to be 
rescheduled, but I had no idea
when they would be.
Its rough to ask for people 
to come out and vote so many 
times, said Sternhell.
This year, the students in 
charge of the electronic system 
used to run the election changed, 
and the system was revised,
which may also account for the 
difficulties.
With different students tak
ing on the leadership roles after 
the former leaders graduated, 
the technical upgrade, the initial 
technical problems, suspected 
tampering, and this last election 
run, the whole process has expe
rienced great difficulty.
Given the conditions under 
which this election was executed, 
if we win, Joe [Arasin] and I vow 
to step down and let GSA and 
Senate elect someone as per the 
constitution, Egelman said on 
Wednesday.
The interim student body pres
ident, Germaine Williams, will 
continue his term until the new 
SBP and SBVPF are appointed 
Monday, Sept. 24. The appoint
ments will be decided based on 
majority vote at the joint GSA 
and Senate meeting held at 5:30 
p.m. that day.
All interested candidates, 
whether or not they ran previ
ously, must submit petitions of
at least 100 signatures to the Of
fice of Student Activities by noon 
Friday, Sept. 21. All university 
students are now eligible to run 
for any of the vacant positions. 
Petitions can be picked up at the 
University Center Information 
Desk or accessed electronically 
at elections.andrew.cmu.edu.
When possible, I have held off 
on the selection of student com
mittee members until the new 
student body president is elected, 
preferring to maintain those ap
pointments as the prerogative of 
the SBP, Williams said.
Once appointed, the SBP will 
appoint a SBVP.
Sternhell believes that Weinstock and Bergstein, the projected 
winners, should be appointed 
SBP and SBVPF, respectively.
No matter how the elections 
went, these votes are still the 
voice of the people, insisted 
Sternhell. Reinstatement of the 
projected winners must just be 
the best and most practical way 
to do it.
The Elections Board has had all sum
mer to work out just these kinds of 
problems.

New device uses nanotubes to track asthma

The device measures nitric oxide levels in peoples breath. The sensor is equipped with a gas scrubber to 
isolate nitric oxide, and a polyethylene imine polymer to make the device especially sensitive to nitric oxide.

Staffwriter
Alexander Star, a chemistry professor in the 
University of Pittsburghs School of Arts and 
Sciences, is leading a team in developing a sen
sor that could detect an asthma attack before 
its onset.
Asthma is a reaction to certain stimuli 
that irritate the respiratory system, and the 
symptoms of asthma range from mild to life 
threatening.
In particular, an asthma sufferer could nega
tively respond to an environmental stimulant 
(or allergen), cold air or emotional stress, ac
cording to the World Health Organization.
An intense episode of asthma is called an 
asthma attack. During an asthma attack, 
the bronchial tubes in the respiratory system 
become inflamed with mucus. Because the 
airway is clogged, a person may experience 
wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, 
and coughing.
Stars device is a nanotube sensor that de
tects increases of nitric oxide in a persons 
breath. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that is highly 
concentrated in the breath of asthma sufferers. 
The nitric oxide present in asthma sufferers is 
at least double the normal range.
Star stated in an e-mail, Healthy indi
viduals are in the range of 6.0-22.0 parts per 
billion of nitric oxide, while those affected by 
asthma are 40.0-80.0 parts per billion.
To detect NO levels in a persons breath, 
Stars team used carbon nanotubes in their 
device. Carbon nanotubes are small wires 
whose diameters are 100,000 times smaller 
than a strand of human hair.
Carbon nanotubes can change their 
electrical conductivity when exposed to 
chemicals. To make their carbon nanotubes 
specifically sensitive to nitric oxide, Star 
and his team coated the tubes with a poly
ethylene imine polymer and added a gas 
converter and a carbon dioxide scrubber.
The use of polyethylene imine polymer 
and the gas converter make the carbon 
nanotube sensor more sensitive and selecSee ASTHMA, page A8
Researchers study life-cycle fuel emissions
Nanogels 
used with 
drugs
by Hanadie Yousef
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon researchers 
have developed non-toxic, bio
degradable nanogels that can 
be used for delivery of carbohydrate-based drugs.
The nanogels were devel
oped using atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP) 
in professor Krzysztof Matyjaszewskis laboratory.
ATRP allows chemists to con
trol the number and length of 
polymers, or molecular chains, 
by adjusting the ratio of initia
tor to monomer.
Using ATRP, we can make 
spheres of the same diameter, 
therefore the nanogels are all 
uniform in size, said Daniel 
Siegwart, a graduate student 
in the Matyjaszewski lab. We 
are creating a more homog
enous system.
The nanogels have even 
mesh sizes, meaning that the 
distance of polymer chains be
tween the cross-linking points 
is equal.
This is unique because it al
lows the gels to have improved 
swelling properties and en
hances the release of the drug 
trapped inside in a uniform, 
time-controlled manner.
The nanogels offer many 
advantages to current drug de
livery techniques due to their 
unique physical characteris
tics.
Gels are polyethylene oxide 
(PEO) based  this can repel 
proteins and reduce absorption 
to material, hence enhancing 
circulation time in the blood.
The nanogels are also bio
degradable, and they are not 
toxic to cells.
If a foreign antigen is too 
big, phagocytes of the immune 
system will engulf the particles.

In a recently published paper 
called Comparative Life-Cycle 
Air Emissions of Coal, Domestic 
Natural Gas, LNG, and SNG for 
Electricity Generation, Carne
gie Mellon researchers reported 
that natural gas may not be the 
most viable energy resource for 
future production of electricity.
Appearing in the Journal of 
Environmental Science and Technology, this paper is the result 
of a study carried out by civil 
and environmental engineer
ing graduate student Paulina 
Jaramillo, Tepper School of 
Business professor W. Michael 
Griffin, and engineering and 
public policy professor H. Scott 
Matthews.
The purpose of this study was 
to analyze the life-cycle green
house gas emissions of different 
fuels. That is, researchers ana
lyzed the environmental impact 
of burning, mining, processing,
transporting, and combusting 
various fuels.
Griffin, who is joint re
searcher and executive director 
of the Green Design Institute, 
said that his efforts were a way 
to understand the environmen
tal impact of a fuel through its 
complete life-cycle.
From a purely chemical stand
point, natural gas is less of a 
pollutant than coal because it 
burns cleaner.
The life-cycle approach taken 
by researchers in this study,
however, offers a more accurate 
representation of the ecological 
consequences of fuel use.
In particular, liquefied natu
ral gas (LNG) is imported from 
other countries, and so there are 
other factors that come in to play 
than simply burning the fuel.
One such factor is the loss of 
fuel during transportation. Grif
fin said that this loss is both an 
economic and environmental 
loss.

Popcorn may cause 
lung disease
According to Cecile Rose, a 
doctor at the National Jewish 
Medical and Research Center, 
fumes from microwave popcorn 
may have led to a deadly lung 
disease in one of her patients.
Rose claims that her patient, 
who consumed two or more 
bags of popcorn per day, expe
rienced coughing and breathing 
difficulty. Medical tests revealed 
that the patient had bronchiol
itis obliterans.
This lung disease was seen 
about five years ago in popcorn 
factory workers. The disease 
may be linked to consumption 
of diacetyl, a chemical found in 
microwave popcorn. High levels 
of diacetyl were detected at the 
home of Roses patient.
Experts have not yet found a 
direct link between consuming 
diacetyl and contracting lung 
disease. However, some com
panies, including General Mills 
and Pop Weaver, said that they 
will stop making their micro
wave popcorn with diacetyl.

Scientists make 
muscle fibers
Harvard University researchers 
have created patterns of muscle 
fibers using molecular chains.
To create these fibers, re
searchers first placed protein 
bands on top of polymers. They 
then placed muscle cells on top 
of these protein bands, and af
ter incubation, the muscle cells 
formed fibers.
In experiments, the muscle fi
bers were arranged into specific 
shapes; researchers moved the 
fibers by shocking them with 
electricity.
The muscle cells used in the 
experiment came from mice. 
Eventually, though, researchers 
would like to use muscle cells 
from human hearts to repair 
damaged organs and test new 
drugs.

IBM creates 
molecular switch
Researchers from IBM have 
developed a molecular switch 
that can rotate without chang
ing shape.
The molecule is called 
naphthalocyanine. It has two 
hydrogen atoms that are lo
cated on opposite ends of the 
molecule, and researchers have 
seen these two atoms flip when 
electricity is applied to the mol
ecule.
Because the switch does not 
change shape when turned on 
or off, it can be combined with 
other switches to form a logic 
gate. A logic gate is a circuit 
whose output is determined by 
patterns of inputs. When an elec
trical pulse is sent through one of 
the molecules, it travels through 
the adjoined molecules.

Tropical disease 
spreads to Europe
Health officials report that the 
disease Chikungunya, which is 
native to the tropics, has spread 
to Europe. The disease may 
continue to spread around the 
world if the virus is hereditary in 
mosquitoes.
Chikungunya is transmitted by 
a type of mosquito called Aedes 
alhopictus. The disease affected 
over 100 people in Italy this sum
mer. Researchers suggest that 
the virus spread to Italy through 
a man who contracted the virus 
in India.
Symptoms include nausea, 
headaches, and muscle pain. 
There is no cure for this disease.

How Things Work: Air Traffic Control
Sarah Mogin
Handling over 80,000 flights 
each day, air traffic controllers in 
the United States guide aircraft 
from the ground to the sky and 
back to the ground.
Using radar and various types 
of computer software, traffic 
controllers are responsible for 
updating pilots on the weather, 
monitoring traffic flow, and en
suring that planes in the air and 
on the ground maintain enough 
distance between one another.
Between the time that an 
airplane takes off and lands, 
information concerning the 
flight of that airplane passes 
through many different control
lers. In fact, the pilot submits 
a flight plan to the airports air 
traffic control tower at least 30 
minutes before takeoff.
A flight data person, who is 
one of the controllers in the traf
fic control tower, reviews the 
weather and enters the flight 
data into a computer connected 
to the Federal Aviation Adminis
tration (FAA) network.
The flight data person also 
prints out a flight progress strip, 
a piece of paper containing the 
flight number, airline name, 
equipment and aircraft specifi
cations, planned airspeed and 
cruising altitude, and intended 
route of flight.
Digitally or by hand, the flight 
progress strip travels to every 
air traffic controller involved in 
guiding the flight. Barring any 
conflicts, the flight data person 
alerts the pilot of the flight plans 
approval and transfers the flight 
progress strip to the towers 
ground controller.
For private pilots, on the other 
hand, the flight service station 
(FSS) handles information about 
the flight plan.
The ground controller, who 
also works in the traffic control 
tower, monitors all ground traf
fic, including aircraft on runways
Courtesy of Proyo City
Air traffic control allows pilots to relay information about weather, speed, altitude, and destination.
and others taxiing to and from 
runways. He radios the pilot to 
tell him when to leave the gate 
and which runway to use.
The local controller, on the 
other hand, directs planes so 
that they take off at safe dis
tances from one another.
After giving the pilot clear
ance to take off, the local 
controller electronically trans
fers the flight progress strip to 
a terminal radar approach con
trol (TRACON) station, and the 
flight is no longer in the airports 
control. TRACON stations, each 
covering an airspace about 
50 miles in diameter, monitor 
planes flying to and from one or 
more nearby airports. 
Following takeoff, the pilot 
turns on the planes transponder, 
a device that detects incoming 
radio signals and sends out its 
own radio signals in reply. The 
transponder finds a radio sig-anal from a TRACON station on 
the ground, and the pilot sends 
a transmission to the station 
containing the flight number, 
speed, altitude, and destination. 
A TRACON departure control
ler receives the signal and gives 
the pilot information regarding 
weather and traffic.
Once the plane flies past the 
TRACON airspace, the depar
ture controller transfers the 
information to controllers at an 
air route traffic control center 
(ARTCC). Airspace in the United 
States consists of 21 zones, each 
of which has its own ARTCC.
A team of ARTCC controllers 
keeps track of the plane as it flies 
through the zone. If the aircraft 
travels into another zone, the 
controllers pass the flights infor
mation to a different ARTCC.
At this point, once the plane 
is en route to its destination, 
changes to the flight plan might 
------------*----------------------------------
be made for several reasons, 
including bad weather and con
gestion. If a destination airport 
is especially crowded, an ARTCC 
controller instructs the aircraft 
to travel in a holding pattern, 
circling the airport until space 
opens up.
Aircraft approach their desti
nation airport in single file, and 
each flights information moves 
to a TRACON approach control
ler as it crosses into TRACON 
airspace. The pilot maneuvers 
the plane in line with the run
way, and the TRACON controller 
transfers the information to a lo
cal controller at the airport when 
the plane is within 10 miles of 
the runway.
The local controller on the 
ground clears the pilot for land
ing and assigns the pilot a taxi
way to exit the runway. A ground 
controller then monitors the 
plane as it travels from the run
way to the gate.
The air traffic control system 
relies heavily on radar, which 
allows control stations to view 
aircraft in 3-D. Radar relies on 
two mechanisms of detection, 
echo and Doppler shift, both of 
which are easy to understand in 
the context of sound.
In sound, an echo is a reflec
tion of sound wave, such as 
when it bounces off a wall. The 
time it takes an echo to return to 
its source is the distance traveled 
divided by the speed of sound.
As for Doppler shift, one can 
consider a car horn as an exam
ple.
If you are standing 100 feet 
from a resting car that honks its 
horn for one minute, you will 
hear the honk of the horn for 
one minute from where you are 
standing.
However, if the car is driving 
towards you, the honk of the 
horn will sound higher pitched, 
and you will hear it for less than 
a full minute.
This effect, known as a Dop
pler shift, has to do with the fact 
that sound travels in waves. As 
the car approaches, the sound 
wave of its horn is compressed, 
meaning that it has a higher 
frequency, which results in 
a higher-pitched honk that lasts 
a shorter amount of time.Simi
larly, a car driving away produces 
a lower-sounding honk that lasts 
slightly over one minute.
Radar monitors radio waves 
using echoes and Doppler shifts. 
If a person were to direct a wave 
at a moving object, that person 
could record its echo to deter
mine the objects distance. In 
particular, the distance is deter
mined by the time it takes for the 
echo to return to the person.
The speed of the moving ob
ject, on the other hand, can be 
calculated by measuring the 
Doppler shift (the faster the ob
ject is approaching, the higher 
the shift).

A8THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 10, 2007
New technologies may change future of fuel
GAS, from A6
The paper also describes the 
economic history of natural gas. 
According to this paper, con
sumption of natural gas spiked 
in the late 1990s due to its 
cheaper cost and environmen
tally friendly combustions.
As a result, the government 
invested heavily in natural gas 
power plants, hoping that these 
plants would help fulfill the in
creased demand for energy in 
the United States during that 
time.
High demand for natural gas 
first led to rising prices; in the 
early 2000s, it resulted in a lack 
of adequate supply for these 
power plants.
Currently, many of these 
plants are running empty and 
represent a loss of public money.
In response, Griffin said, We 
must be more cautious when 
making decisions that have a 
significant effect on the future.
The study argues that 
investment in any kind of energy 
facility must only be considered 
after all of the facts about the 
different fuels are known and 
implications of using coal or 
LNG are understood.
In a recent Carnegie Mellon 
press release, Matthews stated, 
Making this investment ul
timately locks us into certain 
technologies that make it harder
for us to change paths in an in
creasingly carbon-constrained 
world.
Griffin said, The future is 
an ever-evolving concept. Ad
vancement of technologies may 
bring about changes that may be 
almost impossible to predict.
According to Griffin, one tech
nological possibility is the use of 
carbon capture and sequestra
tion (CCS).
CCS involves the storage of 
C02 underground, thus reduc
ing carbon emissions and curb
ing environmental damage.
Griffin said that this technol
ogy is a definite, viable option 
for the fut-ure.
The paper also suggests 
that,advanced technologies are 
important and should be taken 
into account when examining 
the possibility of doing major 
investments in liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) infrastructure.
If CCS were to be imple
mented, for instance, the use of 
coal as a fuel may actually be 
less detrimental .than natural 
gas.
According to Griffin, a largescale outlay on power plants, 
based on generation of electric
ity from natural gas, would be a 
rash decision.
Griffin said I would request 
people to slow down and get 
their breath before reaching 
any conclusions.

Above: Michael Griffin helped analyze the amount of greenhouse gases 
emitted from various fuels. Below: Griffin stands in front of a map show
ing the natural gas distribution in the United States. According to the 
Energy Information Administration, the United States had over 200,000 
billion cubic feet of dry natural gas reserves in the United States in 2005, 
and 63,573,466 residents consumed natural gas.
Sensor detects nitric oxide

tive for nitric oxide gas in condi
tions simulating human breath, 
Star stated.
Brett Allen, the primary re
searcher for this project, worked 
on the detection of NO levels 
with nanotubes in the presence 
of other pertinent gases, such as 
C02 and 02 during exhalation.
Allen stated in an e-mail, 
C02, in particular, is an in
terfering component in the 
detection of NO. By imple
menting a scrubber, I was able 
to quantitatively remove an 
amount of C02 while allowing 
for the detection of NO.
Jigme Sethi, a professor in the 
Division of Pulmonary, Allergy 
and Critical Care Medicine at 
the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Centers Montefiore 
University Hospital, plans to 
clinically test Stars sensor.
In a University of Pittsburgh 
press release, Sethi stated, 
High-levels  perhaps twothirds over normal  [of nitric 
oxide] may precede an attack 
by one to three weeks, but pos
sibly earlier depending on the 
asthmas severity.
Although the hand-held 
asthma sensor works similarly 
to current NO detection devices, 
the use of nanotechnology al
lows Star to make this sensor a 
hand-held device. A hand-held 
device will enable asthmatic 
patients to perform nitric oxide 
measurements at home, Star 
stated.
Sethi stated that measuring 
NO in asthma patients requires 
expensive machines that can 
only be found in outpatient 
clinics. According to Allen, 
a hand-held NO detector is reus
able, portable, and has an inex
pensive design.
Allen would like to see this 
device grow to be as popular as 
the glucose sensors for diabetes. 
Star stated that he would like to 
have every pharmacy carry it 
on their shelves. The ultimate 
goal is that people can get re
lief from this terrible disease, 
Allen stated.
As qf right now, Star has only 
tested his idea using simulated 
human breath. In theory, he has 
proven that carbon nanotube 
sensors can be used to detect 
nitric oxide for asthma treat
ment.
Star stated that further sen
sor development is required to 
take this invention to market 
and such devices would require 
approval from Food and Drug 
Administration before becom
ing commercially available.

Spherical nanogels tested in laboratory with encapsulated anti-cancer drugs
NANOGEL, from A6
The size of our nanogels  about 200 
nanometers in diameter  is the per
fect size because it will not be filtered 
through the liver or kidneys, nor will it 
be engulfed. It wont be easily removed, 
Siegwart said.
Brian Belardi, a senior chemistry 
major conducting research in the lab, 
stated, Nanogels are ideal for drug de
livery, because they are able to traverse 
the cellular membrane via endocytosis 
or, if they are sufficiently small, through 
pores in the membrane.
Endocytosis is a method cells use 
to absorb material from the outside 
through their cell membrane.
In addition, because of the nature 
of ATRP, the various cross-linked poly
meric chains are end-functionalized, 
allowing chemical modification to take 
place. We are able to modify the nano
gels so that any ligand of a cellular 
receptor can be attached, which targets 
the nanogels to specific cells and facili
tates their endocytosis, Belardi said.
A ligand is a molecule that can recog
nize a cellular receptor and attach to it, 
making the nanogels cell-specific.
The nanogels were developed us
ing inverse miniemulsion ATRP, a 
process developed by former postdoc
toral associate Jung Kwon Oh in the 
Matyjaszewski lab.
While regular ATRP involves a wa
ter-oil emulsion in which the majority 
phase is water and the minority phase 
is a hydrophobic substance, inverse 
.miniemulsion is just the opposite. The 
majority phase is hydrophobic, and the 
minority phase is water.
The two phases are then mixed using 
sonification, which creates water1 drop
lets dispersed in the oil phase.
The components needed to synthesize 
polymers  the monomer, initiator and 
catalyst  are in the water droplets. 
The emulsion is stabilized by a soap sur
factant that allows the water droplets to 
remain immersed in the oil.
Siegwart said, While regular emul
sion, in which the majority phase is 
water and the minority phase is hydro
phobic, is cheaper and environmentally 
friendly, it is not so applicable to biologi
cal systems.
With inverse miniemulsion, a polyymer chemist can make water-soluble 
materials, which are much more appli
cable to biological applications.
The ability of the nanogels to enter a 
cell and allow the release of the encap
sulated drug was demonstrated using 
doxorubicin, an anti-cancer drug. Ac
cording to a Carnegie Mellon press 
release, researchers encapsulated doxo
rubicin in the nanogels, and mixed them 
with HeLa cancer cells.
Before gel degradation, the cancer 
cells were healthy and proliferating. Af
ter release of the cancer drug, however,
cancer cell growth became significantly 
inhibited.
The Matyjaszewski lab hopes to make 
these nanogels applicable to other ma
terials besides carbohydrates.
We want to address another difficult 
problem in medicinal biology, the cel
lular delivery of antigene agents, said 
Belardi. Scientists are working on the 
delivery of agents that suppress gene 
expression.
Specifically, I am looking at the de
livery of small interference RNA, siRNA, 
molecules which suppress the expres
sion of a target gene in the cell.
This research was funded by the 
National Science Foundation and the 
National Institutes of Health;

Evgefstos! dishes out delicious veggie eats
Over the past couple of years, the res
taurants on campus have had a turnover 
rate roughly equal to the doctors on ER. 
Good eats like Si Senor and Sushi Two 
have moved from location to location, 
while old favorites like The Original 
Hot Dog Shop disappeared from campus 
altogether. While frequent changes in 
Carnegie Mellons on-campus dining 
facilities may leave some students miss
ing the greasy goodness of the O or 
wandering around campus in search of 
California rolls, the many changes made 
by Housing and Dining Services in 
the recent past indicate that Carnegie 
Mellon is making a real effort to listen 
to its students.
Vegan and vegetarian dining options 
had been sparse in the past. Before this 
year, the average campus eatery fea
tured only a couple of vegan and veg
etarian options  options that were 
almost all some variation on grilled 
vegetables on bread. This year, Hous
ing and Dining Services has finally 
introduced a new on-campus restaurant 
called Evgefstos! that has a full menu of 
both vegan and vegetarian options that 
break out of the boring veggies-on-bread 
standard.
Evgefstos!, which is located in the 
University Center Marketplace (on the 
second floor), features dishes inspired 
by traditional Mediterranean cuisine.
With a menu that includes fresh spinach 
dip, four-cheese macaroni, and delicious 
pizzas, Evgefstos! has quickly become a 
favorite of herbivores and omnivores 
alike.
The benefits of the addition of an
Lights on!
The colored lights adorning the Cut during Orientation beautify campus
all-vegan and vegetarian restaurant on 
campus are obvious: The significant 
veg-head portion of the Carnegie Mel
lon student population can now enjoy 
campus dining as much as meat-eaters. 
Whats even more impressive is that the 
dishes are so varied and imaginative 
so as to attract even those students who 
would normally scoff at the idea of veg
etarian food.
Housing and Dining Services has been 
working very hard to accommodate stu
dent needs in campus dining, and they 
deserve a soy sundae for not only ac
knowledging the long-neglected needs 
of vegans and vegetarians, but creating 
a high-quality menu that elevates the 
standard of food on campus. Now, if we 
could only pronounce the name of the 
restaurant.
If you were on campus at night dur
ing the past couple of weeks, then you 
probably noticed how pleasant it was to 
take an evening stroll past the Univer
sity Center and Purnell.
Alternating columns of red, blue, 
green, and yellow light illuminated the 
pillars along those buildings after dark. 
The result  the university made it 
known to the entire community that we 
were Tartan plaid and proud.
If youre new to this campus, then 
you might have been disappointed to 
see that the lights were taken down, 
turning what was a festive, school spir
ited version of the Cut into a dark and 
unwelcoming lawn zigzagged by a few 
poorly-lit sidewalks  aside from a few 
spotlights illuminating Walking to the 
Sky, of course. We say keep the campus 
pretty. Leave the lights on.
You wont have to miss those lights for 
much longer. The university typically 
erects the lights around Homecoming 
time, in a clear effort to beautify the 
campus for the hordes of alumni who 
flock to the university. Afterward, the 
lights are taken down again and were 
left in the dark.
Making campus more attractive at
night may be at the bottom of your list 
of worries, with the stress of classes, 
homework, and friends. But you might 
be more apt to head to the library to pull 
off that all-nighter if you had something 
pretty to look at.
The university has done a commend
able job of making the campus a great 
environment during the day. Many stu
dents seek refuge from the sun under 
large shady trees, or relax in the peace 
garden, or even take a stroll through 
the Kraus Campo. Lets keep that feeling 
going around the clock by keeping the 
lights on.
Luis von Ahn named one of top young innovators
Seven years after graduating at the 
top of his class from Duke University, 
and only two after obtaining his Ph.D. 
in computer science from Carnegie Mel
lon, our own professor Luis von Ahn has 
yet another honor to add to an already 
burgeoning resume.
In August, Technology Review selected 
von Ahn from a group of 300 nominees 
as one of their top 35 Young Innova
tors Under 35. For von Ahn, this honor 
, comes after years of pathbreaking pa
pers, successful research projects, and 
keynote speeches, not to mention a spot 
on Popular Science magazines list of 
the 10 brilliant scientists of 2006 and 
a $500,000 genius grant from the 
MacArthur Foundation  all in only
two short years.
Von Ahn, whose research specialty is 
the computational abilities of humans, 
has been a pioneer with CAPTCHAs, 
which is an acronym for Completely Au
tomated Public Turing test to tell Com
puters and Humans Apart. Technology 
Reviews editors recognized von Ahn for 
his innovative work on reCAPTCHAs, 
a project which centers on making 
CAPTCHAs out of chunks of actual 
printed texts that are indistinguishable 
to computers.
The Tartan would like to offer Profes
sor von Ahn a hearty congratulations on 
his most recent achievement and thank 
him for everything he has done for the 
betterment of Carnegie Mellon and the
field of human computation.
It is a testament to the hard work done 
at Carnegie Mellon that at the same time 
we are congratulating Professor von 
Ahn, professor Maria Kurnikovas Mel
lon College of Science research group 
is making incredible strides in under
standing Alzheimers disease and pro
fessor Tiziana Di Matteo is busy unrav
eling the history of the universe over in 
the physics department.
So, while we sing the praises of our 
brightest young star, The Tartan wants 
to congratulate all university research
ers, without whom this institution 
would not be the center for collabora
tion and interdisciplinary thought that 
it is.
Success comes to those who 
dare to get uncomfortable

Cs uMarshall Roy
Dear Newbies,
The years just begun, so the whole 
advice from a senior! thing feels a little 
early, I concede. We dont traditionally 
dish out our sincerest advice, our shini
est gems of wisdom, our all-time superduper, double-secret acuminous nug
gets, til, like, April or May.
But one of the neatest things about 
being a senior is that you care less than 
ever about the way things are usually 
done. And you just sort of do them. 
Thats what this column is about.
The zany, colorful flux of Orienta
tion is over. First- and second-week jit
ters are probably subsiding. Youve got 
more new digits than you knew your 
phone could hold. Youre assembling 
a crew. Youve finally nailed the traffic 
light pattern at the corner of Forbes and 
Morewood. This is very good.
All in all, I bet youre beginning to 
feel a whole lot more comfortable here. 
That might not be so good.
Comfort is your enemy. My advice? 
Get comfortable with discomfort. I 
started thinking about all this back at 
the beginning of summer, when I had a 
very enlightening conversation with my 
little brother, Dave.
Dave is probably my best buddy. Hes 
one of those dudes who can handle 
anything, some freaky amalgam of 
Cary Grant and Han Solo. Hes about 
to start his sophomore year at Drexel, 
and this summer he snagged a sweet 
internship with a production company 
in Philadelphia called Shooters. He got 
the job by calling up an executive pro
ducer out of the blue and asking for an 
interview.
I figured hed done all this in his char
acteristically fearless way, so I was sur
prised when he told me that it was the 
most nerve-wracking thing hed ever 
done. But then he outlined the idea that 
inspired this column, that your com
fort zone is a very dangerous place  a 
prison. So when fear of the unknown 
comes knocking, answer it. Itll lead you 
to places more exciting than you can an
ticipate. Youll never regret it.
You dont have to start huge. Smile 
at someone pretty. Ask your professor 
an out there question in front of ev
eryone. Wear something fierce. (For 
chutzpah, I love the Talmudic image of 
an angel coaxing every individual blade 
of grass skyward; imagining Mary Jane
Watson over your shoulder purring Go 
get em, tiger works very well, too.)
No, its not going to go well automati
cally or every time. That pretty person 
might look at you like youre an effing 
psycho. Your professor might insinuate 
that your question wasnt relevant or 
worthwhile. If fierce to you is a tube 
sock and tinfoil hat, youll have lots 
of uncomfortable splainin to do, and 
maybe some special new pills to take.
But at least youll have gone out with 
a bang instead of a whimper.
And after that, what have you really 
got to be afraid of? Failure is damned 
freeing; it frees you to be daring every 
day of your life, and it wont be long till 
youre taking the risks that, combined 
with a little legwork, equal success.
Theres another really good reason to 
bust out of your comfort zone, and its 
best illustrated anecdotally:
At the end of July, in the middle of the 
night, Dave was driving a friend home 
from a party. Shortly after stopping at 
a convenience store for hot chocolate, 
they were hit head-on by a drunk driver 
on a dark back road. Both cars were to
taled. It was only a mile from our house, 
so my parents and I were there within 
minutes.
My point is, sooner or later, like it or 
not, life will force you out of your com
fort zone. It will be frightening and you 
wont deserve it. But if youve made 
Daring your middle name, if youve 
refused to be, as Teddy Roosevelt said, 
among the cold and timid souls, who 
know neither victory nor defeat, then 
youll find, as Dave did, that you un
knowingly picked up awesome reserves 
of courage and grace along the way.
Seriously now, is there a more ulti
mate state of discomfort than being bat
tered, concussed, and covered in broken 
glass and hot chocolate?
To sum up: Frodo and Sam would 
have been a helluva lot more comfort
able if theyd stayed put in the shire: 
King Leonidas and his 299 bros would 
have been a lot more comfortable if 
theyd hung around Sparta pumping 
iron and throwing stuff into their ran
dom bottomless pits. And after having 
his clock rattled by a ferocious Wampa, 
I bet Luke Skywalker would have much 
rather taken in a double sunset on Tatooine than get cozy with a Tauntauns 
entrails.
But these werent guys who were 
afraid of a little discomfort. Not when 
there was a job to do.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 10, 2007 An
Cosmo vs. Esquire: Why do womens magazines lack intellectualism?
________Kristen Lukiewski
Ive always been a big fan of 
magazines  theyre cheap, por
table one-stop-content-shops that 
suit most any kind of mood that 
strikes my fancy in the super
market check-out line. Im such 
a big fan of magazines that, 
despite their expendability, I 
hoard stacks of them in my room 
(blame a natural inclination to be 
a pack rat and a healthy dose of a 
weird guilt). I read a few differ
ent kinds of magazines, usually 
news (Newsweek or Time), design 
(Print or HOW), or womens life
style (Cosmopolitan or Glamour 
or Marie Claire ox Allure, to name 
a few).
Then this summer happened.
It was a hot day in June and 
I was waiting far too long for a 
tomato and mozzarella panini, 
trying to pick a back issue of 
a magazine from the window
sill to pass time, and debating 
which one would most impress 
the hot guy who might walk in
and start up a conversation with 
me because of what Im read
ing (hey, it could happen). I 
skipped over the old Cosmos and 
Marie Claires, ashamed that Id 
even entertain the idea of read
ing that smut while trying to 
appear intellectual (the hot guy 
who might walk in would also 
be very, very smart... obviously). 
An issue of Esquire caught my 
eye, but I felt that might give off 
the wrong impression. I settled 
for an issue of Black and White 
Magazine (for collectors of fine 
photography) that entertained 
me for approximately 52 seconds. 
I glanced back at George Clooney, 
chillin on Esquires cover. I was 
jealous of the Esquire cover. I 
wanted to look at it, touch it. I 
wanted to have made it, really, 
but I also wanted to see what 
other sweet designs were on the 
inside.
I caved  neither my panini 
nor a hot guy was in sight, and 
Esquires typography was too 
much to resist. This, readers, was 
the beginning of a new endeavor 
in my life. I was hooked after 
the table of contents. Such nice
design! Clean! Easy to read! 
Graphic! And the blurbs! Witty! 
I was excited. I read every word 
on every page that wasnt an ad. 
In one sitting. I was sure Id miss 
something crucial if I skipped a 
page. I loved everything. I hadnt 
known what I was missing in 
my oft-read womens lifestyle 
magazines (this list is short): 
everything. Esquires content was 
varied, intelligent, humorous, 
and their features contained some 
serious journalism. And, they still 
have sex! Damn! Why do men get 
this kind of magazine?
At home, I glanced at my col
lection of random Cosmopolitanset-al. Every issue in front of me 
screamed SEX in such big type, 
the name of the magazine might 
as well be Cosmo: SEX. It was sad. 
It is sad. Half of the sex content 
isnt even for women  its all 
about pleasing your man. I went 
to the bookstore in an attempt 
to find the female equivalent of 
Esquire; I left with current issues 
of Esquire. And GQ. And Details. 
And they all rocked my magazine

I did some digging, and
found that both Esquire and 
Cosmopolitan consider them
selves ultimate guides to mens 
and womens lives, respectively. 
Thats fine and all, thats the 
content theyre covering, but 
apparently womens lives are a 
lot more, ahem, superficial. A 
look at their media kits illustrates 
just what is perceived by the 
magazine industry as pertinent 
to mens and womens lives.
Check it: Esquire claims to 
offer intelligent services, stories 
with substance, [and the] abil
ity to entertain and inspire, to 
survey the landscape to unearth 
the smart edge of culture: the 
people, places, things, and 
trends that intelligent, sophisti
cated men want, need, and ought 
to know, and to focus on the 
well-educated, urbane, afflu
ent man. Cosmo, on the other 
hand, believes they inspire with 
information on relationships and 
romance, the best in fashion and 
beauty, the latest on womens 
health and well-being, as well as 
what is happening in pop culture 
and entertainment. Teehee! brb 
I totes have to go fix my mascara
before I finish this..
Esquires second largest portion 
of editorial content is national, 
international, and business 
affairs. Sophisticated! Cosmos 
is fashion. Esquires editorial 
calendar is varied; this years 
issues cover Meaning of Life, 
Dubious Achievements, Style 
Issue, All About Women, The 
Better Man, Most Useful Issue, 
What It Feels Like, Fall Style, 
Esquire 100, Sexiest Woman

Holiday Looks.
Its demeaning that these 
are the topics Cosmo thinks 
encompasses every area of 
[fun fearless females] lifestyle. 
Every area? What about social 
awareness? Professional life? 
Arts and culture? Entertainment 
that isnt biographical inter

bracket have many more things 
to be concerned about than the

There are independent women 
who dont need issue after issue

ways to please and keep a penis. 
At the least, women deserve a

Screwing the intern: Students have to pay big money for summer credit

____________Sarah Mogin
Its easy to complain about 
Carnegie Mellon. Maybe you 
wish for reduced tuition, cheaper 
parking, or even just free print
ing (after all, printing used to be 
free.) The problem is, all of these 
things cost money. My request, 
however, does not: I would like 
units. Nine, to be exact.
I had an unpaid internship 
last summer. About a month in 
advance, I started looking into 
the possibility of obtaining cred
it from Carnegie Mellon  you 
know, for all the blood, sweat, 
and tears (and paper cuts) requi
site of any internship, particularly 
those of the completely unpaid 
variety.
I discovered one horrible, 
illogical rule: In order to receive 
credit for an internship, a student 
has to be enrolled in Carnegie 
Mellon during the semester of the 
internship.
In other words, you have to pay 
tuition. This is the policy for all of 
the colleges at Carnegie Mellon.
Under certain circumstances, 
this might not have been so bad. 
If my internship had been in 
Pittsburgh, I might have planned 
to take classes anyway. Or, if I 
had a money tree in my backyard, 
coins and bills might have fallen 
freely, like acorns and leaves.
Unfortunately, neither was 
the case. My internship was in 
Richmond, Va., and I found the 
prospect of a six-hour commute 
somewhat intimidating. And as 
for the money tree, it was already 
in critical condition after two 
years of paying Carnegie Mellons 
regular tuition. Double drat.
From here, the policy can go 
one of two ways: If your employer 
doesnt care whether or not you 
get credit, you stop; if he or she 
does, you have a few options.
First, you can write a letter 
while tip-toeing on egg shells, 
making sure to include words like 
eligible and qualified with 
respect to your ability to receive
With the unusual number of sunny days, we've noticed an unusually large number of people on the Cut. So we asked,
What class have you already skipped?A PERSONS OPINION
Compiled by Elaine Lee
from The Simpsons to something 
called Monkey-Picked Tea. I had 
numerous conversations with my 
boss and other higher-ups about 
the intricacies of journalism 
(ethics, serial commas), and 
confirmed my suspicion that I 
wouldnt mind working in a place 
like that for real (i.e., for cash 
money). I also added a line to 
my resume and have a couple 
guaranteed letters of recommen
dation under my belt.
All of that is to be expected 
from a good summer internship, 
and Im not complaining. Money 
would have been a bonus  but I 
think I was paid well enough via 
the aforementioned.
So, why even bother asking 
about the units? Because it would 
be so easy, so painless, on the part 
of the university. I dont want a 
new dining facility, or even for 
Carnegie Mellon to fill in the hole 
where the Gates building hope
fully/maybe/possibly will one 
day appear. I just want units.
Ill even pay for them, as long 
as the price is fair. What should 
it cost - for one person to add a 
9 to the number of units on my 
transcript? A thank you? A pat 
on the back? A cookie? Put it on 
my tab.
The point is, Carnegie Mellon 
doesnt exactly have the best rep
utation for compassion toward 
undergraduates. Everyone has 
their complaints, some of which 
are easier to solve than others. 
Some students wish that the 
buses would come on time, that 
electricity and magnetism made 
more sense, or even that we 
werent in Pittsburgh.
But when a really simple sug
gestion comes along  one that 
doesnt even require money  
the university might as well fix 
it. Students are always going to 
complain, why not make at least 
one of them happy?

credit. The letter will be true, 
since you are eligible/qualified 
for credit  you just have to pay. 
Hopefully, this should trick your 
boss-to-be into thinking youll be 
getting credit, even though you 
actually wont.
Now, certain employers are 
picky about receiving proof 
of credit. In this case, you can 
arrange to get one unit of credit 
in the fall semester. Most people 
outside of the Carnegie Mellon 
stratosphere assume one unit to 
be fair compensation; they dont 
realize its worth next to noth
ing due to our inflated system of 
credits.
Last, if your employer insists 
that you receive credit for your 
internship over the summer, the 
only course of action is to register 
(i.e. pay) for one unit of summer 
classes.
You can calculate the cost by 
dividing the current tuition for 
one semester by 36. Using last 
years tuition, thats about $477. 
If I wanted to pay for nine units of 
credit  what I would get easily 
from an internship during the fall 
or spring  the bill would come
to nine times that amount: about 
$4300.
As for me, my employer didnt 
mind that I wasnt getting cred
it, so I dropped it. I was busy 
wrapping up my spring semester; 
and besides, I didnt want to piss 
off my boss-to-be by asking him 
to send some carefully worded 
emails to the Carnegie Mellon 
powers that be.
It almost makes the university 
look like an insurance company 
keep adding hoops for students 
to jump through, and eventually 
everybody stops jumping.
But please, dont think Im 
incapable of looking on the bright 
side. Summer internships  paid 
or unpaid, credited or not  are 
invaluable.
Sure, theres grunt work. I did 
my time at a City Paper-esque 
publication where I worked in 
the editorial department. I 
filed, I phone-called, I e-mailed.
I addressed, I stamped, and I 
licked (envelopes). Once, I even 
got coffee.
That being said, I learned a lot, 
too. I wrote several articles and 
countless blurbs about everything

The Tartans collected 445 rushing yards,

Cody Vild had two interceptions on defense 
and senior safety Jon Scholl led the team 
with 14 tackles.
Everybody played strong, the offense had 
an amazing game, Bodnar said. It didnt 
even feel like the offense was moving the 
ball but they kept scoring. Defensively, we 
had a good game plan, came out strong. I was 
pleasantly surprised by the way we played 
against them.
Everybodys going to circle the Carnegie 
Mellon game, Lackner said. We were a 
good football team last year. Maybe by the
eighth or ninth game people were suspecting 
we were a pretty good team. Now going into 
this season everybody knew it. Theyre going 
to have a bulls eye on us and we know that.
We all know weve got teams coming out 
now, theyre definitely gunning for us a little 
more, Bodnar said. Its week to week, do 
your job, dont really look down toward the 
playoffs, youve got a game to play right now 
and try to prepare for that game and get it 
finished.

by Rose in the 68th and 83rd 
minutes.
The Hopkins tournament set 
the Tartans up for last weekends 
matches against Kenyon and Otterbein colleges.
They took on Kenyon Sat
urday, and although Carnegie 
Mellon took a total of 16 shots in 
comparison to Kenyons seven, 
Kenyon got its three shots on 
frame in the back of the net, re
sulting in three goals.
The first goal of the game was 
scored in the 18th minute by 
Kenyon defender Brooke Rockwern off of a corner kick. It was 
not until the 68th minute that 
the second goal was scored, 
when forward Rachel Goheen 
received the ball in the center 
and chipped the ball over goalie 
Adamss head. At the 77-minute 
mark, Kenyon midfielder Beth 
Blackey headed the ball into the 
back of the net, finalizing the 
score at 3-0.
After the loss to Kenyon, the 
Tartans took on Otterbein on 
Sunday with a revitalized spirit. 
Stever set the tone when she
scored the games first goal in 
the fourth minute by heading a 
corner kick from Rose into the 
back netting.
Coffin followed a minute later 
scoring with an assist from Ste
ver. Rose tallied the third goal 
of the match, rifling a shot from 
outside the box past Otterbein 
goalkeeper Tara Carter.
The Tartans were unable to 
sustain the shut-out when Otter
bein forward Chanel Smith slid a 
ball past Adams in the 80th 
minute. The final score of the 
game was 4-1.
I am excited to be working 
with the program, Warren said. 
I love the personalities of the 
team and am very impressed 
by the talent and dedication as 
a whole. This was a good eyeopener. It showed us that we can 
bounce back from great compe
tition. Hopefully, its a turning 
point in the season and that we 
can continue to develop and suc
ceed.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 10, 2007
Womens volleyball ends 
weekend with two wins
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The womens volleyball team 
opened the 2007 season Friday, 
Aug. 31 with a win against the 
College of Wooster 3-1.
Since that first win, the Tar
tans struggled, losing their next 
six matches, before winning a 
pair of matches last Saturday, 
bringing their season record to 
3-6.
The teams first win against 
Wooster came at the Ohio North
ern Tournament in Ada, Ohio. 
Senior Abbie Toney, sophomore 
Jessica Brackin, and junior Chisom Amaechi each had double 
digit kills with 12, 11, and 10, 
respectively. Brackin led the 
team with eight blocks.
Sophomore setter Samantha 
Carter collected 25 assists and 
nine digs, while first-year Cam
eron Griffin and sophomore 
Cara Fatigati also had nine digs 
each.
Despite the strong start, the 
Tartans fell in their next three 
matches of the tournament, los
ing to Hope College 2-3, Ohio 
Northern University 2-3, and 
Mount St. Joseph 1-3.
The Tartans match against 
host Ohio Northern was par
ticularly close (30-23, 30-21, 
33-35, 21-30, 15-7), as Carn
egie Mellon forced the Polar 
Bears to a fifth game. Toney led 
the team again with 22 kills and 
one block. Amaechi, first-year 
Caroline Size, and Brackin each 
had eight kills. Carter added 33 
assists to the Tartans total.
On Wednesday, the teams bad 
luck continued as they fell to the 
St. Vincent College Bearcats in 
five games 2-3.
Despite the loss, sophomore 
Megan Killeen and Toney each 
recorded double digit kills, col
lecting 18 and 14 respectively. 
Carter again led the team with 
50 assists, while Griffin led the 
team with 12 digs.
Weve taken a majority of 
the teams weve played to five 
games, which is evidence we
have skills to hang with every
one, Toney said.
Last weekend, the Tartans 
traveled to Wooster, Ohio to 
compete in the Wooster tourna
ment. Carnegie Mellon got off 
to a rough start on Friday, losing 
to Mount Union College 1-3 and 
Muskingum College 1-3.
On Friday we started a lineup 
where the oldest two people 
on the court were juniors, both 
who havent had court time 
until this year, Toney said. A 
young team harnesses a lot of 
nervousness which clouds the 
teams potential.
Carnegie Mellon regrouped 
Saturday to win its last two 
matches and finish the tourna
ment 2-2. The two wins came 
against Westminster College 
(3-2) and Alma College (3-0).
Against Westminster, the 
Tartans tied the Titans at 1-1 
and again at 2-2 to force a fifth 
game. Senior Kate Stepp (15), 
Amaechi (14), Size (14), Brackin 
(11), and Toney (10) all had 
double digit kills.
Carter had 67 assists, four 
service aces, three block assists, 
and 10 digs. Steep and Griffin 
also helped the Tartans defen
sively, collecting 14 digs apiece.
Saturday we figured out a lot 
of kinks and were able to pull 
out two wins, Toney said. We 
still arent playing to our po
tential, but its still early in the 
season.
The Tartans defeated Alma 
in three games (30-22, 30-24, 
and 30-17). Toney and Brackin 
each had nine kills, while Carter 
amassed 34 assists. Carters 
performance during the tourna
ment earned her a spot on the 
All-Tournament team.
The Tartans volleyball 
home opener will take place 
Wednesday when they host 
Point Park University in Skibo

Were a really young team, 
Hall said. We have a lot of 
sophomore guys and a couple 
freshmen stepping up. Were go
ing to count on a couple of key 
upperclassmen to really steer us 
in the right direction. You can 
look forward to some exciting 
play out of our youth and we
should expect to be extremely 
competitive in conference and 
out of conference as well.
We had a great class come in 
last year, a lot of starters, Grif

chemistry, a great time on and 
off the field. Were all having 
fun, its great.

talented incoming freshmen, 
Kurp said. I think well definitely 
place high at nationals  we 
should be in the top 10, but top

The Tartan football team 
improved to 2-0 on Saturday 
thanks to a 16-6 victory over the 
visiting Grove City Wolverines. 
The win comes a week after the 
Tartans traveled to the Univer
sity of Rochester and ran over the 
Yellowjackets 33-10.
Carnegie Mellon trailed 6-2 
against Grove City heading into 
halftime, only managing three 
first downs the entire first half. 
We didnt play our best offen
sively in the first half, head 
coach Rich Lackner said.
Defensively we felt strong, 
senior linebacker Jonathan Bod
nar said. We made one mistake 
and they had a big play. The Tar
tans finally found the end zone 
in the third quarter when senior 
fullback Travis Sivek scored on 
a 1-yard touchdown run. Their 
scoring drive was made possible 
by a crucial defensive pass inter
ference penalty on a third and 
long pass attempt to junior tight 
end Derek Wisniewski that fell 
incomplete.
Junior kicker Colin Marks 
tacked on the extra point to give 
Carnegie Mellon a 9-6 lead. In 
the second half I thought our kids 
showed some guts, they came off
the ball better and we certainly 
played better, Lackner said.
The score remained the same 
heading into the fourth quarter 
and the Tartans defense con
tinued their strong play. Grove 
Citys ground game did not have 
any success against Carnegie 
Mellons front seven, led by ju
nior linebacker Jim Sands with 
13 tackles and senior defensive 
tackle Richard Hauffe with 3.5 
sacks.
The Tartans secondary played 
well, especially sophomore safety 
Josh Kresge (two interceptions, 
one fumble recovery) who played 
a role in all three Grove City 
turnovers.

The Carnegie Mellon wom
ens tennis team competed 
against players from Division I 
schools Robert Morris Univer
sity, Duquesne University, and 
the University of Pittsburgh this 
weekend in the annual Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational.
According to head coach Andy 
Girard, the invitational gives 
the Carnegie Mellon women a 
chance to take a crack at the toplevel competition that Pitt and 
Duquesne bring to the tourna
ment before facing conference 
opponents in the regular season.
I think we have the potential 
to be a top-10 program in the 
country. Were very young but 
the girls have a great attitude and
Our defense got us a couple of 
turnovers and gave us some field 
position, I thought our punter 
[senior Matt Adams] did a great 
job of punting the football and 
giving us field position, Lackner 
said.
Midway through the fourth 
quarter, Carnegie Mellon got the 
ball back at their own 39-yard 
line. Junior running back Ryan 
Phillips came into the game re
placing Sivek and reeled off a set 
of rushes, highlighted by a 35- 
yard scamper down the left side 
of the field to the Grove City 13- 
yard line.
We have a great deal of con
fidence in Ryan Phillips. Hes a
work very hard, Girard said. In
deed, the first-year players made 
an impressive debut, with Kelly 
Hart, Brooke Loar, and Ashley 
Herrick scoring victories.
In singles play, Tartan senior 
Amy Staloch took third. She 
edged Pitt player Sabrina Visram 
6-3, 5-7, 10-6 before losing to 
another Pitt player, Elizabeth 
Adams (0-6, 3-6).
Staloch took third place af
ter beating Rachel McGowan of 
Duquesne 8-6. Also in flight one, 
first-year Jennifer Chui lost 6-7 
(5), 6-0, 7-10 to McGowan in a 
see-saw affair.
In the second flight of singles, 
Hart inflicted a double bagel on 
Robert Morris opponent Kali Delorie (6-0, 6-0). Theres always 
a bigger fish in the pond though, 
and Hart lost to Carlie Smith of 
Pitt (6-1, 6-1). Loar went 2-1
good football player, Lackner 
said.
Sophomore running back Da
vid Babcock capped off the drive 
with a 13-yard counter around 
the left side and into the end zone 
for his first career touchdown. 
Markss kick made the score 16-6 
in favor of the Tartans with 5:11 
remaining in the game.
Its always tough playing 
these guys, Bodnar said, who 
had 10 tackles and a forced fum
ble on the day. Ive been coming 
to these games since I was little 
and I remember playing these 
guys ever since then so they come

overall by defeating another Pitt 
player 6-2, 3-6, 10-6 and also 
Rebecca Poole of Duquesne 
(8-3). She finished third in the 
second flight.
Although sophomore Alisa 
Liebowitz lost two close matches 
in the second flight, she was 
upbeat. Its really good competi
tion. Our games are brought up. 
We compete really well against 
them.
In the third flight, Herrick

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team opened up the 2007 
season last week with a pair of 
victories, getting off to a perfect 
2-0 start. The Tartans hit the 
road and defeated Washington
& Jefferson 3-1 Wednesday 
and made their home debut a 
successful one, beating West
minster College 3-0 Saturday 
night.
So far so good, were getting 
our results, sophomore for
ward Ricky Griffin said. Weve 
had two great first halves and 
decent second halves. We just 
need to keep practicing, keep 
working hard.
Against W & J, Griffin was 
involved in all three goals, 
scoring two and assisting on 
another. Griffin started the 
scoring in the 18th minute with 
sophomore forward Patrick 
Lutz registering the assist. Lutz 
booted home Carnegie Mellons 
second goal 12 minutes later off 
passes from Griffin and sopho
more midfielder Ryan Browne.
After W & J scored early in the 
second half, Carnegie Mellon 
responded in the 53rd minute 
with an insurance goal from 
Griffin, with junior midfielder 
Dan Brackley assisting.
Against Westminster on Sat
urday, sophomore midfielder 
Jonathan Hall scored the first 
two goals of his career in the 
win, and first-year midfielder 
Maximilian Betzig sandwiched 
his first career goal in between 
Halls heroics.
Halls first goal came in the 
20th minute when Brackleys 
free kick was flicked toward 
the center of the penalty box 
by sophomore midfielder Jona
than Simon.
Hall one-timed Simons cross 
into the back of the net. Betzig 
put the Tartans up by two goals
49 seconds later when he slid 
feet first to tap into the net a 
flick from Griffin.
Hall tallied his second goal 
in the 34th minute when he 
volleyed a low line drive cross 
from Brackley into the net. On 
the play, Brackley received a 
longer cross from Browne prior 
to setting up Hall.
I was just in the right spot 
at the right time, Hall said. I 
got into the penalty area and 
we had two great services, one 
by Dan Brackley and Jon Simon 
and I was the man on the spot in 
those situations.

the second half with the Tar
tans out-shooting the Titans 
17-9. Carnegie Mellon junior

Womens soccer even at 
2-2 to begin season
by Elizabeth Haldane
Junior Staffwriter
After competing in the Johns 
Hopkins University tournament 
Sept. 1-2, and in the Otterbein 
College tournament last week
end, the womens soccer team has 
a 2-2 record, tallying eight goals 
for and seven against.
With the addition of assistant 
coach Betsy Warren, and the in
troduction of junior Mary Ashe, 
sophomore Eleonore Valencia, 
and first-years Kate Smith and 
Emily Overstreet to the starting 
lineup, the 2007 squad is signifi
cantly different from last years. 
Despite having a young team, 
Carnegie Mellons deep bench 
allowed the underclassmen to 
contribute in the first match of the 
season against the 16th-ranked 
Johns Hopkins.
Senior Kasey Stever put in the 
games first goal in the 39th min
ute of play. Stever received a cross 
from first-year Valerie Corvino 
and finished the ball to the far 
post to close out the first half on 
top.
The Blue Jays increased their of
fensive pressure, playing several
skillful through balls, which were 
stopped by junior goalkeeper 
Christie Adams. Adams made five 
saves throughout the game.
Hopkins morale skyrocketed 
when junior Molly Steele scored 
the equalizer in the 69th minute. 
They concentrated on their de
fense and put a second goal in the 
back of the Tartans net at the 79- 
minute mark with an assist from 
Steele to Claire Pelura. With a 
final result of 2-1, Carnegie Mel
lon recorded its first loss of the 
season.
The Tartans rebounded from 
the loss, taking on Guilford Col
lege with more intensity and 
defeating them 4-1. Carnegie 
Mellon scored an early goal in the 
third minute from junior Abby 
Coffin and assisted by senior tri
captain Jessica Howard. In the 
12th minute, Stever scored on a 
corner kick from senior tri-cap
tain Amanda Rose.
Guilford came back at the 37- 
minute mark when Amanda Sperr 
scored its only goal.
The Tartans retaliated with two 
more goals, both of which were 
scored by Corvino and assisted

up with Sivek last week to talk 
about his success and the up
coming season.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing football, and how did 
you get into it?
Sivek: I started playing flag 
football in third grade, and then 
tackle in fifth grade. I really 
liked playing pretty much every 
sport at that age, and at that 
point I played every sport except 
hockey.
T: What made you want to 
play football in college?
S: I really wanted to continue 
playing in college because I re
ally love the team atmosphere. 
You get really close spending 
that much time with the same 
group of guys and I would have 
missed getting to be a part of 
that. I also really enjoyed play
ing the game itself and wanted 
to keep on playing for as long 
as I could.
T: Was football part of your 
decision in coming to Carnegie 
Mellon?
S: I chose Carnegie Mellon 
mainly for its ^academics, but
I met with the coaches, and 
visited, and realized what an 
amazing environment the uni
versity and team created here.
T: How do you manage to 
keep up with academics during 
the football season?
S: Its all about keeping up on 
the work and doing work ahead 
of time. Away games are the 
hardest to deal with academi
cally.
T: Do you have a favorite 
place to play?
S: We dont get to play there 
this year, but I loved getting to 
play in Colorado. It was really 
weird to notice the thin air there 
when you play. When youre 
running you dont notice it, but 
then you get over to the sideline, 
and are panting and wheezing. 
It was an experience. Chicago is 
really fun too. Its a really good 
trip to go on with the team and 
we usually have the night off to 
go out.
T: Is there anything or anyone 
in particular you attribute your 
success to?
S: My entire career Ive just
been lucky to [be] around good 
coaches who have really pushed 
me, and have gotten to be a part 
of good teams with a lot of other 
great players. The entire thing is 
very synergistic and I have been 
fortunate.
T: Do you have any team goals 
in mind for the football season?
S: Definitely. There is no rea
son why our season cant work 
out like last year did. We have so 
many returning talented play
ers, and as a team I believe were 
just as good if not better than 
last season.
T: During the off-season, what 
are some of your favorite things 
to do in Pittsburgh?
S: Thats the good part about 
the off-season; you have the 
time to get out more and to 
experience the city and every
thing.
I love the food in the area. Im 
a big fan of Union Grill; I take all 
of my friends and family from 
out-of-town there. I like the in
cline, and going up to Mount 
Washington. I would love to say 
Steelers games, but I still havent 
gotten to one.

Miller Gallery reveals Nakashima
New furniture exhibit also features metal sculpturesEverything you need to know
About party poopers and Prince Okay.
Walking into the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery, 
visitors enter a dimly lit room containing a taste of 
whats to come: one of Dee Briggss steel sculptures 
and two of George Nakashimas wooden chairs. 
Friday, Aug. 31, the space hummed with voices of 
visitors at the opening reception for the Nakashima 
Revealed and Dee Briggs exhibits.
Nakashima Revealed showcases Carnegie Mellons 
collection of Nakashimas work, which has never 
been exhibited. This collection, which comprises 60 
pieces, is over 40 years old, and is still in use at the 
university.
At the Nakashima Revealed areas on floors one and 
three, Nakashima's correspondences, sketches, and 
price sheets hang on the walls alongside photographs 
of the furniture around campus, in addition to a large 
portrait of Nakashima in his workshop. Visitors are 
also able to explore a touchable display of different 
kinds of wood Nakashima used when creating his 
designs. The furniture looks beautiful, so well made 
that even the corners are executed with extreme 
exactness. But this exhibition is not only about 
the furniture and Nakashimas trademark, timeless 
design; it is also about the collection owned by 
Carnegie Mellon and how the university acquired it.
*
The second floor holds the other exhibition, featuring 
the work of Briggs. As Briggs works with metal, 
her art proves quite a contrast to the organic wood 
furniture on the surrounding floors. Some of her 
pieces are massive steel sculptures, standing as tall 
as the people walking around them. Her display also 
includes small paper models and steel structures.
"It is a great honor to have my work standing next 
to his, said Briggs about having her work shown 
with Nakashima's. Briggs had the option to have 
an exhibition later in the year, which would give 
her time to create a body of work specifically for the 
show, but turned it down, enthusiastic to share a 
space with Nakashimas work.
Both artists were formally trained as architects prior 
to pursuing careers in art. Briggs turned to sculpture 
with steel, although she lacked any formal training. 
She has been learning from experience, and is 
currently focusing on creating larger sculptures, since 
she is always interested in making her sculptures 
could be more accessible to the viewer. "My work 
is about spaces, I think a lot about spaces because I 
was trained as architect, Briggs explained.
Until recently, Briggs taught in the School of 
Architecture, before she decided to leave her 
teaching position so she could take time to fully 
devote herself to making sculpture. Briggs is excited 
to simply focus on her work, but she admits that she 
will miss teaching; the work she was doing with her 
students informed and challenged her sculpture. 
Briggs devoted her summer to the creation of the 
pieces now on display at the gallery, and she made 
the large hanging piece just a week before the 
opening. To create these steel sculptures, Briggs 
looks to the relationships and experiences she has 
with other people for inspiration. I think my work is 
alive in a lot of ways, Briggs said.
Nakashima's artwork is also alive, but in a different 
way than Briggss. Designing furniture, Nakashima 
believed he was giving trees a new life. He worked 
with and around pieces of wood, embracing the 
imperfections, knots, and irregularities in his work.
Nakashima Revealed is the result of an academic 
project, which was the focus of an exhibition class 
last spring in the School of Design. Led by instructors 
Rachel Delphia and Laura Vinchesi, students 
designed and put together the exhibition, website, 
and catalog.
The story of Nakashimas furniture for Carnegie 
Mellon began in 1957, when a campus development 
plan featured a push to erect some new buildings 
around the school. The plan included the construction 
and furnishing of Warner Hall. The university hired 
one of Nakashima's previous clients, interior designer 
Paul Planert, who commissioned Nakashimas 
furniture in 1965. The furniture was meant to outfit 
the presidents office, vice presidents office, and 
other administrative offices in Warner Hall. In 
addition, Nakashima also created three custom wood 
screens that once stood in the faculty dining room in 
Skibo (the former Student Union) that were 54 feet in 
length. After the buildings demolition in 1994, the 
three panels had to be put in storage, but recently 
two of the panels have been moved into the library to 
the first floor study area.
Regarding the relationship between the two 
exhibitions, at first it may seem as if the two 
different bodies of work lack congruency and that 
the artists have nothing more in common than 
their backgrounds. Both Briggs and Nakashima 
were trained in architecture, but chose to devote 
themselves to their respective creation of art. It' is 
interesting to note that this is Briggs's first solo 
exhibit in a gallery, and Carnegie Mellons collection 
of Nakashimas work has never been published or 
exhibited either.
As for the Miller Gallery, the two bodies of work 
are able to form a cohesive exhibition, despite the 
separate mediums. The passion and relationship 
with materials [is what really connects and unifies our 
work], although I work with steel and he with wood, 
said Briggs.

Look here LSH (I refuse to call 
you LUSH because you are 
NOT unlovable!), havent you 
watched movies? This isnt a 
social disorder, its just a perfectly 
normal case of wanting the 
unattainable. Do you think Prince 
Charming was as enamored of 
Sleeping Beauty once she woke 
up? Definitely not. So theres no 
need to condemn yourself, but 
you still have some work to do. 
The next time you find someone 
attractive who seems to like you, 
bite your lip and fight the urge to 
run. Give the man a chance. Even 
if everything feels less exciting at 
first once the chase is over, give 
it a few dates, see how things 
go. You might find that having a 
good time with an attainable man 
isnt so bad after all; If you still 
dont like him after a few dates, 
apologize and leave  dont 
break anyone eises heart. But 
above all, the best way to get 
better at dating is to date. Even if 
you spend some time with Prince 
Okay before finding Charming.

Hey Myrtle,
Im really stressed and 
overcommitted but I hate 
telling my friends that I cant 
go out partying with them. 
How can I say no without it 
sounding like go away?
 Poopin On Parties
Hey there POP,
First of all, tell your friends the 
truth. Explain that you're stressed 
and overcommitted instead of 
making up a lame excuse about 
feeling under the weather or 
having to wash your cat. Then, 
the next time you have some 
spare time between exams and 
prior commitments, make the 
move to invite them to go out
 that way theyll know that your 
reluctance to party doesnt mean 
you dont like them. Its also okay 
to invite your friends to hang out 
for shorter periods of time  grab 
a coffee, solve the crossword
 to show them you love them 
without bogging down your 
schedule. Dont worry  if your 
friends are friends worth having, 
theyll understand! Good luck!

Idol audition proves to be a Simon-less experience
forward to perform for 30 seconds, and then steps back for the 
second singer to come forward, and so on.
12 p.m. About 300 people have gone through auditions, but 
only five have made it through to the next round. Of these 
five, one is dressed in a Batman costume.
2 p.m. So far I have seen about 15 people cry, one person 
tearfully begging to the extent that the judge actually lets her 
go into the next round, and three more people smile happily 
and skip off with their golden tickets to the next auditions.
5:07 p.m. I audition! Im the first in my group, and I sing 
"Songbird" by Fleetwood Mac. After I finish singing, the 
judges talk behind a clipboard. I step back in line, and the 
next three people sing. After we finish, we are all asked to 
step forward, and...
5:08 p.m. The judges tell all four of us that we do not have 
strong enough voices to continue in the competition. Thank 
you for participating.
5:10 p.m. As I shuffle out with the rest of the losers, or nonwinners, as the producers call us, I see a few fellow rejects 
talking to American Idol cameras about how they shouldve 
been given another chance, or didn't sing as well as they 
could have, etc. I am happy with my audition, and having 
gone through the audition process, I believe that American 
Idol is a legitimate talent contest. Although half'of the people 
sent through to the next round were jokes, wearing silly 
costumes, the majority of the people I saw audition were 
great singers. Unfortunately, with 20,000 people auditioning 
and just a few plane tickets to Hollywood, chances are like 
winning the lottery. But hey, theres always that small chance, 
right?

This October, American Idol will begin its eighth season. 
Once again, I will be sitting in front of the TV, laughing along 
with millions of Americans at the crazy people: some crazy 
good, some crazily bad. Except this year, I wont be telling 
myself, "I should do that! I should audition!" Because I have. 
Just two weeks ago, I stood in line with hundreds of other 
American Idol wannabes, and actually tried my hand at 
becoming this seasons next singing sensation.
3:45 a.m., Saturday, Aug. 24 My mother and I leave our 
home in Connecticut in order to make it to Philadelphia by 6 
am No, this is not the day of the audition. This is the day to . 
sign up for the audition.
5:45 a.m. We reach the thruway exit to Philadelphia on our 
way to the Wachovia Center, which opens at 6 a.m. Seeing 
brake lights, we slow down and soon realize we are stuck in 
/a traffic jam, with at least 5000 other cars. So much for being 
early.
7:45 a.m. I decide to begin walking to the Wachovia Center 
while my mom waits in the American Idol traffic. As I 
reach the line, I see thousands of people, some in ridiculous 
costumes, others looking like they just rolled out of bed, 
crowd the entire area. And although this is one of the largest 
masses of people I have ever seen in my life, everyone is 
incredibly friendly.
8:45 a.m. I am waiting in a pen of at least 700  talk about 
a cattle call! There are five other pens full of people in front of 
me in line.
9:45 a.m. Still waiting, although I am not too bored because
I have made friends with two girls: one, Jennifer Waters, a 
musical theater major who graduated from Syracuse, another, 
Adrina Lewis, a senior at University of Pennsylvania, a 
communications major. Both live in Philadelphia and did not 
have to make a two-and-half-hour trek.
The only thing Im really worried about is getting to my 
waitressing job later this afternoon," says Jennifer, who works 
alongside Adrina.
Adrina adds, This is much crazier than I expected."
11:50 a.m. I make it to the registration and receive a blue . 
wristband to wear to audition, as well as a seat ticket in the 
Wachovia Center that will also serve as my place in line. My 
Mom gets a white wristband and a seat beside me; only one 
support person is allowed per contestant.
6 a.m., Monday, Aug. 27. Although we were instructed by 
American Idol personnel to arrive between 5 and 6 a.m. the 
day of the audition, we knew to come later to avoid excessive 
waiting. Since we signed up for my audition two days earlier, 
we already have a designated place in line.
7 a.m. In the Wachovia Center parking lot, over 20,000 people 
are lined up, looking more polished now and warming up 
their voices. American Idol employees assure everyone that 
they will get a chance to audition.
8-10 a.m. Those auditioning wait in the Wachovia Centers 
gigantic auditorium. We then proceed to make good 
television," as the producer of the show asks us to scream 
various phrases like, "I'm the next American Idol! as the 
camera, hoisted high on a trolley, pans the entire stadium. 
People who have dressed up for the occasion (some in angel 
costumes, prom dresses, or drag) are specifically pointed 
out by the producer to be filmed. Im wearing a simple black 
dress  not exactly stand-out material.
10:30 a.m. American Idol host Ryan Seacrest enters 
stadium, says his one line, "This is American Idol\" and then 
disappears.
11 a.m. The producer is satisfied with the amount of footage 
of the crowd standing up and cheering, and the auditions are 
about to begin. On TV, the producers make it look like every 
audition takes place in front of judges Paula Abdul, Simon 
Cowell, and Randy Jackson. Of course, this is not the case. 
There are several cuts that are made before the three judges 
see the 25 best (and 25 worst) singers of each city. For now, 
production assistants, camera people, and other various 
people involved in creating the show must sift through 20,000 
hopefuls. Auditions are conducted on the main floor of the 
stadium: there are 18 tables separated by black curtains, and 
one or two producers listen to each contestant. Four people 
are presented to the judge at a time, each singer steps

Kanye graduates without honors, Caribou gets the AOn album orders
Caribou, Andorra
Do you remember the first time you listened to The 
Beach Boys album Pet Sounds? By the time you heard 
Brian Wilson finish singing the line "Wouldn't it be nice 
if we were older"  about 10 seconds into the song  
you intuitively knew that Pet Sounds as a whole would 
be, well, awesome. How can people infer the greatness 
of an entire album from just the first 10 seconds of the 
opening track? I dont know, but they can. This same 
phenomenon occurs on Caribous latest record, Andorra, 
with its opening song, Melody Day." At the very 
beginning of this track, too, with its abrupt entrance, 
subdued melody, and pulsating beat, we somehow 
know that we are in for a 42-minute-long musical treat.
Kanye West, Graduation
Kanye West has plenty of reasons to be proud of 
himself: Hes a Grammy Award-winning and multi
platinum-selling rapper and producer: He also has his 
own record label and clothing line. But his life isn't all 
about commercial success: He drunkenly interrupted 
an acceptance speech for an award he didnt win and 
jarred the mainstream political world when he claimed 
on national television that "George Bush does not care 
about black people."
On his strong third release, Graduation, Kanye is damn 
vocal about his success. On Champion," he asks 
himself nicely with a Steely Dan sample: Did
How can people infer the greatness of an entire 
album from just the first 10 seconds of the opening 
track? I dont know, but they can.
We can trust our intuition. On Andorra, Dan Snaith 
(Caribou is his moniker) gives us flowery and innocent 
melodies, reminiscent of 60s psychedelia. The backup 
vocals in "Shes the One," singing dit-dit-dit on loop, 
remind us of the charming bridge in The Beatles Girl." 
And when we hear the giant leaps of the vocal lines, the 
multi-layered falsetto parts floating in the background, 
the endless harmonies, and the multitude of quirky 
instruments, we cannot help but think of The Beach 
Boys.
Yet, Snaith  who, as a side note, just received a Ph.D. 
in math  does more than recollect and reproduce 
the musical glories of the 1960s. Apparent alongside 
this throwback sound is experimental electrnica, a 
computerized style that Snaith had mastered earlier in 
his career under the now-extinct moniker Manitoba. 
Snaith fills this work with tape loops, drum machines, 
synths, and heavily warped vocal tracks, keeping the 
album fresh and innovative. In the last three songs, 
unstructured and predominantly instrumental, Snaiths 
electronic past dominates. Coincidence or not, these 
three pieces are the least compelling.
Andorra really epitomizes everything thats potentially 
wonderful about pop music. Pleasurable verses move 
in a dreamlike manner into eagerly awaited, celestial 
choruses. The song "Desiree" exemplifies this best. You 
will find yourself scrolling through your iPod faster than 
usual to get your dose of Andorra between classes. You 
should consider moderating your intake of these songs 
so you dont exhaust too soon the.pure joy you derive 
from hearing them. Why cant all pop music be like this?
Steven Weinberg | Staffwriter
you realize you were a champion in their eyes? Its a 
pretty rhetorical question in context, but Kanye answers 
anyway: "I think I did."
Sure, rappers have been talking big for decades, but 
Kanye has plenty of other-interesting things he could be 
saying. Instead, more boasting: "I always had a passion 
for flashing, he raps crassly on "The Good Life. On 
Glory he claims, With my ego I could stand there in a 
speedo and be looked at like a fucking hero.
On Graduation, Kanye is musically less consistent 
than on his previous efforts. His strongest tracks are 
surprisingly the ones without his trademark gospel 
samples. On "Stronger, he samples electronic group 
Daft Punk's Harder Better Faster Stronger," and on 
Barry Bonds," crunchy synthesizers and punchy 
string patterns. On Homecoming," Kanye falls short of 
bridging the gap between pop and hip-hop (a gap hes 
crossed so well in the past): Chris Martins piano bounce 
sits squarely underneath Kanye's downbeat-heavy drum 
break.
Maybe it was the expectation of Kanye's personal (and 
therefore musical) development that makes Graduation 
a little bit disappointing. But then again, Kanye without 
an ego would be like Carnegie Mellon without smelly 
people. And sometimes, its better to have too much 
character (or odor) than none at all.

So youre a rock star  congratulations. Youve finally recorded your
10 or 12 songs, and youre ready to finish the album and send it off to 
record execs everywhere. But wait  which song goes where?
Now, if youre Britney Spears or Three Doors Down, you can throw 
all the singles in a row at the beginning. Whatever. Youll sell millions 
anyway, and as long as you hear that one catchy tune, who cares if 
its a coherent or even listenable album? But this problem of poorly 
planned albums exceeds the top 40, and may even reach artists you 
like (see Becks Guero, Ratatats self-titled, or Modest Mouses latest 
for examples of albums that leave you bored by the halfway point).
On a side note, there aren't many albums that fail in the reverse 
direction. Maybe musicians are scared that nobody will listen if they 
load up the back of an album with hits.
So, youre planning your CD. What comes first? Ideally, it'd be an 
attention getter, but not the only hit. Like Eating Glass from Bloc 
Partys Silent Alarm is one example. Its jagged, angular, and quick, and 
sets the stage for the albuiru And, if you bought the album because 
you heard Banquet (track four) on the radio, youll keep listening.
Next, cool down a bit  right out of High Fidelity. I wouldnt say add 
some filler, but maybe if youve got a couple songs that are pretty 
typical of your sound but not the greatest, tracks two or three might 
be a good place to put them. Another option is to lead off with a 
throwaway intro track (although this will annoy shufflers) and put the 
attention-getter at track two, as in the Foo Fighters album The Colour 
and the Shape (Doll followed by Monkey Wrench").
At around track four, drop- the hit. Theres a lot of precedent here: 
Weezers blue album, Daft Punks Discovery, the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
album Californication, even the new Arcade Fire album. The ideal 
album would keep the next few tracks pretty strong, with something 
else interesting around eight to keep everyone listening.
By then, most of your best songs might be exhausted. How do you 
keep people interested then? If youre making Talking Heads: 77, you 
just keep tossing on great songs. Fine. If not, you can switch gears; 
some great albums have kept interest because their second halves 
have been the deeper, moodier counterparts to the upbeat first halves 
(see Abbey Hoad and Of Montreals The Sunlandic Twins.) A contrast 
will help listeners break the album into chunks that they can easily 
absorb. And thats the goal, right?
On the other hand, if youre making a concept album, disregard this 
all entirely and follow your muse! Just, whatever you do, dont put a 
secret track after 12 minutes of silence at the end.

Less reality, more originality
Prepare yourself for Cavemen, Kid Nation, and more
The air is crisper, the days are shorter, and everyone on 
campus seems to have a hacking cough. We all know what 
that means: It's officially fall. With the end of the summer 
blockbusters, fall means that its time for the small screen to 
take precedence over the big screen. In other words, time to 
kick back and embrace your inner couch potato.
This season brings with it a host of new shows and one 
exciting trend: less reality TV! Out of the 26 new shows 
debuting on ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and The CW, only three 
are reality shows. Of these three, at least one looks fairly 
interesting  and this is coming from a person with a strong 
hatred of anything to do with reality TV.
So, in the interest of saving you time and TWo, here's a 
quick rundown of the shows that look the most (and least) 
promising this season. One things for sure: You wont get 
them confused.
Back to You (Fox) Premieres Wednesday, Sept. 19. 8 p.m.
Its a show set in Pittsburgh! The show stars Kelsey Grammer 
(anyone-else love Frasier?) and Patricia Heaton (Ray's wife on 
Everybody Loves Raymond), who play TV anchors for a small 
Pittsburgh television station. It sounds like that show News 
Radio  if anyone else remembers that.
Gossip Girl (The CW) Premieres Wednesday, Sept. 19. 9 p.m.
Now that The O.C. is gone, there has to be another drama 
about ridiculouslywealthy high schoolers who have more 
money than brains. The CW to the rescue! The new series 
Gossip Girl follows a group of over-privileged New York 
high schoolers whose lives are chronicled by a mysterious 
blogger named Gossip Girl. She knows everyone's dirty little 
secrets and delivers them directly to you via text messages. 
Developed by the creators of The O.C. and based on the 
popular book series by Cecily von Ziegesar, this show is 
guaranteed to be a hit with teenagers.
Kid Nation (CBS) Premieres Wednesday, Sept. 19. 8 p.m.
What do you get when you put 40 kids ages 8 to 15 in a 
deserted ghost town without adult supervision? Hopefully, it 
doesnt result in a live-action reenactment of Lord of the Flies. 
This show looks like a fairly interesting social experiment
 that is, if it doesn't focus too much on crying children who 
want out.
Private Practice (ABC) Premieres Wednesday Sept. 26.
9 p.m.
Many suspected that the episode of Grey's Anatomy which 
featured Dr. Addison Montgomery (actress Kate Walsh) in 
California was the setup for a spin-off, and here it is! Private 
Practice stars Walsh as a neonatal surgeon who's leaving 
Seattle (poor McSteamy) in search of sunnier pastures. We 
can only hope that this show is half as interesting as Grey's
Anatomy, and the executives of Private Practice are banking 
on the fact that it will be as addictive.
Bionic Woman (NBC)
Premieres Wednesday,
Sept. 2. 9 p.m.
During the past few 
years, there have been 
a plethora of movies 
about guys with super 
powers  not so many 
featuring women. NBC 
is looking to change 
that. The resurrection 
of .the 1976-78 series 
Bionic Woman is timed 
perfectly to satisfy 
the superhero fix that 
viewers need after 
a summer filled with 
superhero blockbusters like 
Transformers and Spider-Man 3. However, the jurys 
still out on whether or not this series will have your 
Spidey senses tingling.
You might have to triple-book your TYVo for Wednesday 
nights because it seems like the networks are pulling 
out all the stops for it. So, if you get the chance between 
studying, studying, and more-studying, check it out. After all, 
anythings better than watching another episode of Friends in 
syndication.
Pratima Neti | Staffwriter
Big Shots (ABC) Premieres Thursday, 
Sept. 27.10 p.m.
Michael Vartan, Dylan 
McDermott, Christopher 
Titus, and Joshua Malina.
Other than the fact that all of them 
have had recurring roles in fairly 
popular TV shows, they now all 
have something else in common:
Theyre all becoming high-ranking 
executives. ABCs new show Big 
Shots features these four as execs who 
get together to talk about the two most 
important things in their lives: money and 
power. It sounds a little like Sex and the City, 
except this version is more like Sex and the 
Boardroom. Only one question remains  who 
gets to play Miranda?
Cavemen (ABC) Premieres Tuesday, Oct. 2. 
8 p.m.
One of the first TV shows to be developed 
from a successful ad campaign, this 
sitcom follows the lives of three cavemen 
who end up living in a southern suburb. The 
series has already come under fire from critics as being 
a "racial metaphor. As a result of these comments, ABC 
completely reworked the pilot. Apparently, making a TV show 
about stereotypes of a certain group of people isnt so easy a 
caveman can do it.

Surprise! Youre dead
McCaffery Mysteries offers a celebration with a fatal twist
Every Saturday night in September and October, the Green 
Room at the Funny Bone in Station Square will be putting on 
It's My Peaty and I'll Die If I Want To!, a comedic, interactive 
murder mystery. A McCaffery Mysteries production, 
this murder mystery gives the members of the audience 
more than some good laughs; it gives them a chance to 
participate in charity. McCaffery Mysteries, Inc. is a non
profit organization benefiting both the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society and the Animal Rescue League of Western 
Pennsylvania.
Mercedes, and all the characters exit the scene to deal with 
the situation in the ways they see fit.
Then the murder takes place. After everyone is inside, a 
guard (Matt Freas) enters to inform everyone that a murder 
has taken place in the parking lot. Promise enters the room 
and screams that blood has gotten on her skirt. It is revealed 
that Ted has been murdered by being repeatedly run over by 
his own Mercedes. Coincidentally each of the characters has 
a key.
Artistic director and director Cory McCaffery Sigler keeps a 
good eye for using all of his casts talents. Kleemook, who has 
a B.F.A. in musical theater from Youngstown State University, 
turns singing to a comedic ploy when Promise sings "I Will 
Always Love You as an abrupt eulogy for Ted.
So, for anyone who is clueless as what to do on a Saturday 
night, a charitable, interactive murder mystery is not a bad 
idea. Its only 20 bucks plus a two-drink minimum  and you 
get to see naked ladies. Theyre on the walls.
It's My Party and I'll Die III Want To! is a surprise party for 
Teds (Larry Herman) 50th birthday, hosted by his overly 
fatuous wife, Tiffany (Erica Skirpan). The audience plays 
the role of the party's guest, so expect Tiffany to greet you 
sometime during the play as "Francine, who just got out of 
rehab, or some such thing. Of course, there are other invited 
guests: Teds senile and sour father George (David Bonta), 
and Ted's bitter ex-wife Sandy (Karen Walker).
Before Ted makes his appearance, the caustic conversations 
between the three fill the audience in on Teds character. He 
is a professional disappointment" in his fathers eyes, is a 
womanizer in Sandys, and, as Tiffany reveals, has entered 
into a mid-life crisis. Tiffanys "proper" and "sweet" nature 
causes her to only see a troubled, dear husband. However, 
Ted brings along an unexpected guest who forces Tiffany to 
further sink into denial about her husband's true nature.
Just after the audience screams out, "Surprise! and sings 
For Hes a Jolly Good Fellow, Ted (wearing a Vote for 
Pedro shirt, no less) reveals that he will be leaving Tiffany for 
Promise (Kari Kleemook), a simple-minded, well-built teenage 
girl. He leaves an upset Tiffany behind to fetch Promise in his
After some debate, the audience is left to help the guard 
figure out who the murderer is. The cast passes out 
some sheets filled with questions that the audience must 
answer. With three tie-breaker questions, the majority vote 
determines the ending, or, who killed Ted. To top it off, 
the cast hands out awards for The Most Clueless, CSI 
Detective (the one who tried too hard), and the "Winner of 
the Day, who gets a T-shirt along with his or her certificate 
in celebration of accurateness.
The cast works well together. Although each character 
portrays a certain extreme (one is very stupid while another 
is very bitter, for example), the actors use the wit in the script 
to maintain a kind of balance; each overwhelming personality 
constantly thwarts another. For example, Teds father and 
ex-wife take turns subverting his current wife Tiffanys edgy 
voice with their sardonic and unfeeling tones.
Playing the guard, Freas is one of the last actors to appear, 
and he offers a refreshing feel to the play. His tennis shoes 
and frequently befuddled expression seem perfectly fitting for 
a man who doesnt mind looking up a teenagers skirt as he 
tries to solve a murder mystery.

If youre going to see this, its 
probably because you didnt

story isnt particularly great, 
but the series thrives on its 
characters and choice eye candy 
anyway. The special effects 
are good, too. Great, even. In 
fact, this third movie is really all 
about being a visual feast for the

Beyond the salad
Vegetarian survival on campus
by Cecilia Westbrook | Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon isnt a bad place to be if youre a vegetarian. The word is Greek for 'delicious and tasty, Rearick said.
Recent changes by Housing and Dining Services have been 
emphasizing friendliness to vegetarians, including a new 
restaurant in the University Center, new and expanded 
menu items across campus, and new options in the new 
convenience center Entropy+.
"We know that vegetarianism is becoming a bigger and 
bigger trend on campus, and were doing everything we can 
to accommodate it, said Ryan Rearick, assistant director of 
Housing and Dining.
The recent push has been largely due to feedback from 
students and the Carnegie Mellon community, according 
to Rearick. One of the most consistent complaints among 
students had been the lack of vegetarian dining options.
Vegetarianism and veganism are on an upward trend in 
college students across the country. A 1999 report by the 
National Restaurant Association estimated that as many 
as 20 percent of college students consider themselves 
vegetarians, and projected that the number would rise. A 
2005 report by hospitality services giant Aramark discovered 
that one-quarter of nearly 100,000 college students surveyed 
said that finding vegan menu options on campus was 
important to them.
In response, Housing and Dining initiated a series of steps 
designed to fix the problem. First was implementation of the 
Crunch program, which consists of signs at dining locations 
indicating what menu items at each location are vegetarian 
or vegan.
The Crunch program was not actually an addition of new 
menu items, but just advertising what we already had," 
said Rearick. According to Rearick, a big part of the problem 
was that students werent aware of what vegetarian options 
already existed.
Some folks were just going to the same places over and over 
because they knew they could get [vegetarian] stuff there, 
he said.
Housing and Dining also expanded vegetarian options in 
Schatz Dining Room last year in conjunction with the Crunch 
program. In addition, dining locations on campus extended 
their hours to provide vegetarian students more options for 
dinner.
This year, the centerpiece of Housing and Dining's 
vegetarian thrust is the opening of a new restaurant in the 
University Center. The restaurant is called Evgefstos! (The 
name is not as unpronounceable as it appears if broken down 
into three syllables: Ev-gef-stos.)
Evgefstos! offers a 100 percent vegetarian and vegan menu 
based around Mediterranean cuisines. The restaurant 
features hot entrees and cold salads as well as pre-packaged 
items. Students can choose from one of several entrees or can 
eat in a more a la carte style. It has more of a tapas bar kind 
of feel, but you can still get a good meal, Rearick said.
On the whole, student response to the new restaurant has 
been positive, Rearick said. The Dining Advisory Council, 
which contains students, staff, and faculty, has already 
received positive input.
We were expecting it to make a splash, and it really seems 
to have done so, Rearick said.
Another aspect of Housing and Dining's approach to 
vegetarian dining is through a registered nutritionist, Paula 
Martin. Martin is now in her third year at Health Services and 
has extensive experience working with the nutritional needs 
of students.
The nutritionist is available for appointments to provide 
nutrition advice and counseling to individual students.
This service is available to all students regardless of dietary 
restrictions, but may be particularly useful to vegetarians or 
those considering vegetarianism and are looking for advice 
into how to structure their diets.
Martin also provides nutritional information through the 
Health Services website. There is a section of the site 
devoted to vegetarianism, which includes dietary advice, 
quick meal ideas, and links to vegetarian resources outside 
the university.
Rearick reports mostly positive feedback from vegetarian 
students. However, there are several consistent concerns 
about vegetarian dining on campus.
One issue mentioned frequently among students both 
vegetarian and non is the cost of dining. Vegetarian options 
on campus are not any more expensive than their meatcontaining counterparts  but they arent any cheaper, 
either. Vegetarian entrees typically cost as much as meat 
entrees.
In addition, vegetarian meals often contain fatty foods like 
cheese to compensate for the lack of meat, making them 
relatively unhealthy. This may be a deterrent to students 
interested in eating vegetarian for health benefits.
Unlike most students, I dont really have a problem with 
campus dining, said Benjamin Saalbach-Walsh, a senior 
creative writing major. Aside from being a longtime
vegetarian, Saalbach-Walsh is an active member of the 
Neville Co-op and Voices for Animals.
Saalbach-Walsh, like many vegetarian and non-vegetarian 
students, chooses to cook most of his food at home. In order 
to maintain an ecologically responsible vegetarian lifestyle, 
he prefers to buy most of his food at the East End Food Co
op, which sells organic and locally grown produce.
Many students are interested in seeing more locally grown 
and ecologically sound food being served on campus. 
Saalbach-Walsh was involved in the campaign to get 
Housing and Dining Services to switch to certified cagefree eggs  eggs from chickens raised in more humane 
conditions.
However, not all vegetarian students have such strong ideals 
for choosing not to eat on campus. Lauren Heller, a recent 
Carnegie Mellon alumna, also preferred to cook at home in 
her off-campus apartment when she was a student. Her 
reasons for not eating on campus were partly due to price, 
but also because she saw most of the meals on campus as 
being unbalanced or unhealthy.
My options were mostly limited to French fries and deepfried cheese products, she said.
Rearick emphasized that concerns and complaints can be 
directed to the Dining Advisory Council, which works closely 
with Housing and Dining to improve dining based on student 
feedback.
Vegetarian students who are looking for more off-campus 
options can also check out the wide array of vegetarian 
and vegetarian-friendly options in the greater Pittsburgh 
community. Of note are Zenith Caf on the South Side and 
Quiet Storm in Garfield, both relatively easy bus rides from 
campus and offering 100 percent vegetarian menus.
Just because the food is vegetarian doesnt mean it isnt still 
good. "Were friendly to meat-eaters, too, said Elaine Smith, 
owner of the Zenith Caf.
Additionally, affordable vegetarian meals can be purchased 
at most of the food trucks on Margaret Morrison Street. Srees 
Foods and Open Flame Foods offer vegetarian entrees, and 
tofu can be substituted for meat at the other trucks.
However, both Heller and Saalbach-Walsh agreed that dining 
is changing on campus for vegetarians.
"Things certainly seem to be improving compared to when I 
was a student, Heller said.

Star performer
Artist Andrea Fraser kicks off lecture series
Did you know?
Performance artist Andrea Fraser began the fall season of the 
School of Art Lecture Series. The lecture became an artistic 
venue itself, with Fraser slipping in and out of various roles. 
She spoke broadly about her entire body of work, including 
one of her most famous pieces, Museum Highlights (1989), 
a performance where she posed as a museum tour guide 
offering fake museum tours, focusing on common objects 
other than the artwork.
Likewise, Fraser spent time touching on her later works, 
which solidified her standing as an avant-garde artist. For 
example, her 2002 video performance Untitled questioned 
the relationship between a buyer, the artist, and a piece 
of artwork as Fraser turned an act of arranged sex into the 
artwork itself. Her performance was a commissioned act of 
prostitution, recorded in a hotel room as a silent film with one 
stationary camera angle. It raises questions about where the 
line should be drawn between pornography and art, and about 
a female's role in her artwork.
Fraser's artwork has been classified as "art in context, as well 
as "institutional critique, the latter of which is a questioning 
of the physical means and methods that surround and support 
artwork. And yet, many of her pieces maintain a level of 
satire. A video piece entitled Little Frank and his Carp (2001) 
is a reaction piece to the audio tour of the Guggenheim 
Museum in Bilbao, Spain. In this performance, Fraser begins 
to lift up her dress, exposing her rear, as she rubs one of the 
walls of the Guggenheims grand entrance (as was suggested 
in the audio tour). Official Welcome (2001), a piece that is (to 
Frasers dislike) posted on YouTube, mimics and combines 
the speeches given at an artists reception of an award. In this 
speech, she identifies herself as not being a person, rather 
an object in an artwork  an idea that provides insight to 
her work on a broader scale. The performance climaxes with 
Fraser stripping off all her clothing and parading around the 
podium, and it ends with her crying for the sake of her artistic 
career.
Time and time again, Fraser's work pushes the envelope. 
Through performance, video, and installation, she 
continuously questions the origins and support surrounding 
her work.
