University officials and Chinese dignitaries 
dedicated a statue of Carnegie Tech alumnus 
Mao Yisheng in a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
last Tuesday afternoon outside Baker Hall. 
The work was the first piece of art to be in
stalled on campus under the direction of the 
Public Art Committee.
Carnegie Mellon president Jared L. Cohon 
began the program by recognizing the invited 
guests, which included Maos daughter and 
grandson. He also pointed out representatives 
of the organizations that had been instrumen
tal in the statues production.
Zhao Zhongxian, the vice-president of 
the China Association for Science and Tech
nology and an academician of the Chinese 
AcademyofSciences,gaveabriefoutlineofMaos 
career.
A native of Jiangsu province, China, Mao 
began work on his civil engineering PhD at 
Carnegie Tech in 1917. Two years later, at the 
age of 23, he became the schools first PhD 
graduate.
Dr. Mao Yisheng enjoyed a special 
relationship with Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity, Zhao said through an interpreter. [His 
work here] laid a solid foundation for his later 
achievement.
President Jared Cohon speaks in front of the new 
statue of Mao Yisheng last Tuesday.
After completing his degree, Mao enjoyed a 
long career as an educator and bridge designer 
in China. In his professional capacity, he de
signed that countrys first dual-use bridge. He 
was also a faculty member at five universities 
and president of four.
Since Maos time here, Carnegie Mellon has 
educated generations of Chinese talents, 
Zhao said, a trend he anticipates will continue 
in future years.
It is my hope that this statue can ... 
continue to inspire all the Chinese students 
overseas and in this school ... to contribute

Student body presidential 
candidates debate positions
by Shawn Wertz
Assistant News Editor
Public attention was ironically the theme for the 
sparsely attended student government forum last 
Tuesday. The three executive tickets running in 
this years election for student body president and 
vice-president debated with each other in prepa
ration for the student government elections to be 
held today and tomorrow.
While only approximately 30 students attended 
the forum in Hamburg Hall 1000, each presiden
tial and vice-presidential candidate remained 
confident that he or she would be  and already is 
 well known on campus.
People will definitely be able to identify who 
we are, said vice-presidential candidate Andrea 
Hamilton. Hamilton is running with presidential 
candidate Karl Sjogren.
Kelly Duncan, vice-presidential running mate to 
Justin Berka, agreed. We want to make sure were 
a visible presence on campus, said Duncan. And 
people already know who we are.
The third executive ticket, led by Daniel Horbatt 
with running mate Alan Eaton, agreed that being 
accessible and in the public eye are important for 
the role of executives.
The three executive tickets covered topics rang
ing from their policies toward pubic art on campus to whether each voted for the Students Bill of 
Rights.
Eaton summarized the differences between the 
executive tickets: The hardest thing is that were 
all driven people. You see the platform and the 
tickets and you think, What are the differences? 
The differences are subtle.
Daniel Horbatt and Alan Eaton
Horbatt is a junior in electrical and computer 
engineering. He is a member of Kappa Delta Rho 
and has been an active member on the Campus Life 
Committee of Student Senate.
Eaton is a sophomore civil engineering major. 
He is a member of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity 
and a member of the Joint Funding Committee of 
Senate.
How elections flew off track:

The debate attendance:
 31 people were in the audience. A 
total of 37 people were in the room in 
total, including the candidate teams.
 Currently, 7997 students are eligible 
to vote at CMU. The 35 eligible 
students in the room represented 
0.44 percent of the student body able 
to vote.
 30 percent of the people in 
attendance were members of The 
Tartans staff (11 of 37). .
 43 percent of people in attendance 
were from campus media organizations 
(16 of 37).
Horbatt and Eaton stressed that they will 
mostly continue the work of current president 
Tom Sabram and vice-president NicOlette Louissaint.
Theres only so much you accomplish in a 
year, Horbatt said. If you set something up, and 
the next person doesnt follow up with that, then 
its kind of a waste of time.

Low return 
in Senate 
petitions
by Andrew Peters
Staffwriter
With 37 seats up for grabs in 
the Carnegie Mellon Student 
Senate, only 21 people have 
submitted petitions to fight for 
them. Where the problem lies 
depends on who you ask.
Senate candidates were sup
posed to have their petitions in 
to the Election Board by April 
14 and had to confirm their can
didacy by last Friday evening. 
Of the 27 who originally sub
mitted petitions, only 21 have 
accepted.
Current Senators do not have 
to resubmit petitions, and their 
names reappear automatically 
on the ballot.
People are doing what they 
can when they have the time to 
do it, said senior decision sci
ence major Franklin Williams, 
chair of the Senate Elections 
Committee, indicating that 
many people are too busy to join 
Senate and that even those on 
it already are too busy to per
form some of their duties.
Williams feels interest is low 
because students dont perceive 
a real benefit to joining Senate, 
as a spot on Senate offers nei
ther pay nor credit.
Williams put up posters and 
asked housefellows to send 
e-mails to all their residents in

dress and how you conduct yourself is simply 
another form of communication.
To remedy this, CMBA presented Dress to 
Impress last Tuesday to show students the 
importance of physical appearance on secur
ing a job.

country, he said.
Though the statue was installed just last 
week, the idea of its construction dates back 
about two and a half years to when Volker 
Hartkopf, a professor in the School of Archi
tecture, visited the Broad Air Conditioning 
Co. factory in Changsha, China. He noticed 
that the grounds contained several statues of 
historical figures, and showed photos of them 
to PhD student Hongxi Yin.
When Broad Co. CEO Zhang Yue later 
came to Pittsburgh, Yin told him about Maos 
achievement at Carnegie Mellon and asked

Even though Newsweek dubbed Carnegie 
Mellon the hottest [university] for getting a 
job, its students need more than a diploma to 
land a career.
Weak communication skills are singlehandedly the biggest complaint I have heard

The next step for 
CMUs media groups 
_
Bradford Yankiver
Last Thursday, just a few hours after 
Midway opened, about 200 members of 
the Carnegie Mellon media community 
gathered for a shared barbeque. This 
shouldnt be particularly surprising or 
special  but in a way, it is. At no point 
in recent memory has the media com
munity come together as it did last 
week. This touch of unity is exactly 
what campus media needs. In fact, if we 
dont begin to work together, media at 
Carnegie Mellon will become obsolete.
The media landscape is changing 
across the board. The popularity of 
DVDs is minimizing the role of the 
theater in the movie business. TiVo and 
on-demand video have made television 
customizable. Radio is under attack 
from the MP3 player, file sharing, and 
podcasting. Newspapers can never be 
as up-to-date as an online news source, 
but fewer and fewer people want to 
read the news anyway  theyre look
ing for video. Todays technology is 
changing the way we use and experi
ence our media  its time Carnegie 
Mellons media caught up.
Some newspapermen have said that 
the Internet would bring about the 
death of the newspaper. Im sure that 
many years from now, there will be no 
paper in the news business. But that 
really has no negative implications for 
the general public. All the functions 
served by todays paper news will be 
served by whatever new forms are to 
come. Even the sense of community is 
replicable. Eventually, news websites 
might tell you tell you which of your 
friends have read an article youre read
ing or viewed a video youre watching. 
Theres nothing stopping news from 
joining with the online social network
ing technology thats made Facebook so 
successful. No doubt, there will be great 
change. But change in media should be 
seen as an opportunity, not as a threat.
Not only can campus media best 
serve their community through collab
oration, but our organizations can also 
best accomplish our individual goals by 
working together.
The biggest challenge we face today 
is capturing an audience, whether it be 
viewers? listeners, or readers. Our audi
ences are accustomed to sensationalism 
and interactivity; campus news in a 
single medium just cant keep up. But 
by using our collective resources to find 
the best content and then make it con
sumable in as many forms as possible, 
from print to podcast, we can keep the 
campus interested and involved.
But better content isnt the only way 
a cooperative relationship would help 
our organizations. Undoubtedly, co
operative recruiting, marketing, sales, 
accounting, and management could 
streamline the overall amount of work 
that must occur for all of our organiza
tions to function optimally.
Marketing is a task none of our orga
nizations does well enough  but joint 
marketing would make the task easier, 
in terms of both labor and expense.
The sale of ads, sponsorships, and 
underwriting is, perhaps, another of 
the most obvious areas where consoli
dation could yield great benefits for all 
parties. Advertisers know that choosing 
one medium isnt enough for their mar
keting campaign to have a big impact. 
Jointly, packages of marketing opportu
nities that span the various media will 
make the most compelling product.
All this is a far cry from a shared 
barbeque, but theres nothing stopping 
it from coming together over the course 
of the next year. With Jennifer Parry 
Bird set to return as the advisor to all 
the major media groups, its clear that 
those in the Office of Student Activities 
see the potential.
With the spectrum of Carnegie 
Mellons capacity for technological in
novation at our fingertips, there is no 
reason why our media organizations 
shouldnt be on the cutting edge of 
medias evolution.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 24, 2006
Saudi Students House holds event to promote national awareness
by Matthew McKee
Staffwriter
Outside the University Centers 
Connan Room last Wednesday, 
pamphlets laid on tables provided 
information about Islamic terror
ists, moral systems, and politics.
Inside, Saudi Arabian students 
celebrated cultural values with 
fellow Carnegie Mellon students 
from all kinds of backgrounds.
To foster cultural exchange, 
the Saudi Students House (SSH) 
in Pittsburgh led the Saudi Open 
House last week.
The open house filled every
inch of the Connan Room with 
spectators and Saudi culture.
The event featured Saudi 
games, food, art, dances, and 
tattoos. Students dressed in tra
ditional Saudi attire greeted visi
tors and served authentic food to 
a long line of chattering guests.
Hoda Moustapha, who recently
received her PhD from Carnegie 
Mellon, displayed her works of art 
at the open house.
Moustapha takes cultural and 
religious words and makes them 
into many different designs for 
paintings. She believes that this 
event will help students a lot.
Once people see a different
culture, they change their per
ception, Moustapha said.
The SSH held a similar event 
at the University of Pittsburgh 
recently. Basil As-Sadhan, a PhD 
candidate in Carnegie Mellons 
electrical and computer engi
neering department and the 
president of SSH, said that the
Pitt Open House received posi
tive feedback that encouraged 
him and his fellow students to 
bring the event to Carnegie Mel
lon.
In order to learn about others, 
we must present ourselves,

DEBATES, from Al
ganization meetings, Graduate Student 
Assembly meetings, and Student Senate 
meetings every week.
This is one of the things we have to 
do to maintain a finger on the pulse of 
the community, Horbatt said. The 
faster you find the problems the easier 
they are to deal with.
Horbatt and Eaton said that their 
running platform is generic enough to 
appeal to both undergraduate and grad
uate students.
Parking spaces and the activities fee are 
two issues that Horbatt and Eaton hope 
to address. The two plan on setting up 
focus groups and brainstorming sessions 
to think of ways to address the issues.
We dont have a direct solution for 
any of these right now, he said. Were 
working with finite resources.
The ticket also plans to address absen
teeism among Student Senators. Eaton 
said he wants to make Senators more 
accountable for their actions.
Horbatt and Eaton will unveil their 
new plan to gather student information 
along with their issue platform. Horbatt 
titled the plan Flash opinion mob.
In this plan, the pair plans to visit the 
high-traffic area outside Doherty Hall 
and offer students cookies if they give 
their opinions on what they feel needs to 
be changed on campus.
. I think of any candidate, were 
the ones who tackle things the 
hardest, Horbatt said. We have the 
best ideas.
Justin Berka and Kelly Duncan
Berka is a junior Science and Humani
ties Scholar and economics major. He will 
be entering the accelerated masters pro
gram through the Heinz School next year.
Duncan is a sophomore with majors in 
physics and math.
Berka and Duncan feel their ticket 
is the strongest because of experience. 
The other people may have a year on us, 
but weve got a lot of experience in many 
different organizations, Duncan said.
We feel were probably the most con
nected campaign ticket. Were going to 
be able to get things done, Berka said. 
If you ask people, there probably wont 
be many who disagree.
Berka said that he was most proud of his 
work as Student Dormitory Council presi
dent, as a member of the Carnival Com
mittee, and as a sexual assault advisor.
Duncan is currently an active mem
ber of Student Senate and is on the Joint 
Funding Committee.
At the time of their interview, the 
candidates did not have their platform 
finished. Berka and Duncan addressed 
the most important points of their in
tended platform, which included facili
tating communication with administra
tors and addressing current plans to 
increase the student activities fee.
Berka and Duncan said that commu
nication is not open enough between 
administrators, Senators, and students 
on campus.
As a Student Senator you only have 
so much power, Duncan said, and that 
really bothers me.
Berka and Duncan said they will work 
to abolish night and weekend parking 
fees, as well as get the University shuttle 
service to run more often for graduate 
students.
Berka and Duncan also want to ad
dress public art on campus and to put 
minors back onto diplomas.
Karl Sjogren and Andrea Hamilton
Sjogren is a junior majoring in social
and decision sciences and human-computer interaction. Next year, Sjogren 
will be entering the Heinz School as a 
member of the accelerated masters pro
gram in public policy.
Hamilton is a junior in the Bachelors 
of Humanities and Arts program and 
majoring in ethics, history, and public 
policy.
Sjogren and Hamilton said they hope 
to approach the job as president and 
vice-president uniquely. Our definition 
of being an executive is a two-part one: 
One, having a positive vision for campus, 
and two, having the ability to accomplish 
goals on campus, Sjogren said
Sjogren and Hamiltons platform 
focuses on three main issues: im
proving campus facilities, increasing 
communication among students and 
administrators, and addressing the 
needs of graduate and undergraduate 
students.
The running mates said they have 
been focusing on improving campus 
facilities through their work on Student 
Senate.
Ive been trying to set up a test trial 
for TiVos in the dorms, Sjogren said, 
That way RAs could make watching 
particular TV shows a group activity
when everyone has free time.
Sjogren and Hamilton are also try
ing make campus administrators more 
accountable for their actions by requir
ing them to communicate regularly with 
students.
The running mates made reference 
to the administrations actions concern
ing public art. It robs the students of a 
feeling of ownership of their campus, 
because they never know whats going 
on, Hamilton said.
The candidates also stressed their 
desire to strengthen Greek Council. As 
a whole, the only outlet that all of the 
Greek community has is Greek Council, 
Sjogren said.
Hamilton agreed, saying, It would be 
great if there were a Greek fund instead 
of just particular house funds.
Sjogren and Hamilton said that over
all, their platform is not about enacting 
major differences on campus. Instead, 
the ticket wants to listen to students to 
see what needs to be changed.
We will be in touch and responsive 
to, and responsible for what students 
want and need, Hamilton said.

Event showcases Saudi cultureStatue honors first PhD recipient
SAUDI, from A3
As-Sadhan said. Its a two-way 
exchange.... [Saudi] students in 
America are not only just study
ing. They are mingling and 
living with Americans as well.
Students of different back
grounds mingled quite a bit in 
the small room, and interested 
students could learn about Saudi 
traditions through PowerPoint 
presentations and display boards 
with printed information.
Nazeeh Al-Othmany, a gradu
ate student in electrical engi
neering at Pitt, believes that 
such information exchange both 
educates and counters poor 
media representation of both 
cultures.
I want people to take from 
this [an unwillingness] to sur
render to media stereotypes, 
Al-Othmany said.
Al-Othmany believes that 
Americans think of Saudi Ara
bia as a desert country with a lot 
of oil, and he said that the open
house would encourage more 
interaction to change that 
perception.
He also said that the Saudis see 
America as a haven of high crime 
rate and killings on the street.
The image of the United 
States in the eyes of Saudis is

Visitors could have a photo taken 
while wearing a Saudi headdress.
the image of Sylvester Stallone, 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce 
Willis, and Jerry Springer, said 
Al-Othmany.
If the American media is do
ing such a bad job at presenting 
its own culture, you can image 
how bad its doing at presenting 
other cultures.
As for the influence of cultural 
exchanges, Al-Othmany be
lieves that changing stereotypes 
through grassroots movements 
will eventually influence politi
cians.
He also emphasized the im
portance of more educational 
programs like delegations and 
student exchanges.
We need to be proactive in 
presenting our culture and our 
values to the society so that 
people would learn about us 
and would not be scared of us, 
because people fear what they 
dont know, Al-Othmany said. 
The only way to make these 
perceptions disappear is through 
interactions.

Zhang if he would be interested 
in sponsoring a commemorative 
statue.
He immediately said yes,. 
Hartkopfsaid.
Since additional donors were 
brought on board to cover the de

in the construction of the monu
ment, Hartkopfsaid.

tions Committee.
Williams and Betz agree that 
both Elections and Communica
tions got off to a late start.
The Communications Com
mittee was a little behind, said 
Betz, a former member of the 
committee. We started late and 
couldnt handle it.
Betz, however, thinks that the 
real problem may lie not with 
Communications, but rather 
with some misconceptions on 
the part of students.
A lot of people dont think 
they can get the 25 signatures in 
two days, but they totally can, 
Betz said, referring to the num
ber of signatures necessary on a 
petition to run for Senate.
Misunderstandings, however, 
may not be the entire problem. 
According to Senator Joe Arasin, 
Senate may suffer from lack of 
support because it is perceived 
as ineffective.
Its not due to people not 
wanting to make a difference, 
Arasin said. The problem is that 
current Senators are not running 
because they feel like they can 
make a bigger difference outside 
of Senate.
Arasin, a Senator for two
criticism.
There was some reservation 
which was voiced about figura
tive art versus more abstract art. 
There was some discussionwe 
dont have a sculpture of Andrew 
Carnegie, so why have one of a 
PhD recipient?
Since the statues completion 
last Tuesday, Hartkopf said he 
had heard absolutely nothing 
negative. He said that the largerthan-life size of the eight-anda-half-foot-tall bronze work, 
which had been a concern at the 
art forum in March, is not 
noticeable from a distance and 
keeps the statue from being
years, will not run in Mondays 
elections, as he has chosen to 
give up his seat.
Senate Chair Julie Beckenstein sees a different problem: 
Senators who choose to run for 
an executive position sometimes 
decide not to run for Senate.
This year, three tickets of 
candidates, all six of whom are 
Senators, are running for 
executive positions. Depending 
on who wins the election, be
tween four and six people are not 
going to have a place in student 
government. Either way, Senate 
is losing experienced members.
Its emotionally hard to say 
Im going to go back where I just 
lost,  Beckenstein said.
Beckenstein, who has been on 
the Senate for longer than either 
Betz or Arasin, doesnt see the 
lack of candidates as an indicator 
of failures in the Senate.
I dont think this is a trend. 
Some years you get a hundred 
candidates, some years you 
dont, Beckenstein said. It goes 
back and forth.
Arasin agrees that there have 
not always been so few candi
dates.
It varies from year to year. 
Last year there were a lot of very 
competitive elections, Arasin 
said.
According to Beckenstein, 
many people elected to Senate 
this year were involved in a lot of 
extracurricular activities, which 
let them bring their experience 
and ability to communicate to
dwarfed by its alcove.
The statue of Mao was cre
ated by Chinese sculptor Sun Lu, 
a faculty member at the China 
Central Academy of Fine Arts 
in Beijing. The relief around the 
statue was designed by Wang 
Jianfeng and Long Xiang, the 
head of the sculpture depart
ment at the China Academy of 
Art Institute.
The relief includes an inscrip
tion of Maos name written by 
Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, 
a noted calligrapher who saw 
the statue unveiled in Chang
sha before it came to the United 
States.
the Senate. Unfortunately, it also 
means they are often too busy to 
perform some of their Senatorial 
duties.
Student Senators are elected 
proportionally by school, and 
right now there is no school that 
has more candidates than it has 
seats.
Wherever the problem started, 
it will be solved next semes
ter when the Senate appoints 
enough candidates to represent 
each school.
Betz only sees problems get
ting candidates from the College 
of Fine Arts (CFA). He cites class 
scheduling and the existence 
of a smaller, more direct repre
sentative body within CFA as 
difficulties in attracting Senators 
from CFA.
It is disappointing we dont 
have more students interested 
in serving the community in this 
capacity, said Gina Casalegno, 
director of Student Activities. I 
believe students have the capac
ity to dramatically influence the 
life of the campus and create 
positive change.
While we wont be in a po
sition to fully elect next years 
Senate this spring, I do believe 
those who are elected have the 
opportunity to create a vision 
for Senate and its role on our 
campus and can work to com
municate that vision to students 
next year.

Students learn to dress and impress
DRESS, from Al
Your appearance says a lot about you that youre 
not necessarily saying, she said.
In her presentation, Martin noted the impor
tance of appearance  including attitude and body 
language while communicating.
In some cases, your attitude can override what 
youre wearing, Martin said.
Women
Im called into companies every week because 
the manager is so concerned about the image of 
their employees. Women are wearing suits that are 
stylistic  but not appropriate, Martin said.
For business interviews, Martin suggested 
sticking with whats classically acceptable  a 
conservative suit with a skirt in black, navy, or 
gray.
Girls should always wear pantyhose, and shoes 
should be just as dark as or darker than the fabric, 
with closed-toed heels being preferred.
Every woman should have a pair of black 
pumps, Martin recommended.
For dressing business casual, Martin noted that 
womens pants suits are more casual than those 
with a matching skirt. She also suggested wearing 
a sweater over a buttoned-down shirt and pants.
In the office or on an interview, silky camisoles 
are not appropriate under any jacket, Martin said.
Men
For a first interview, Martin suggested dressing 
up, regardless of the companys climate.
Dont be tricked into thinking you can dress in 
business casual for an interview, she said.
According to Martin, navy blue is the best, 
[and] safest suit color for an interview. However, 
she noted that men can also wear either solid black, 
pinstripes, or a dark gray.
Martin noted that men are safest in white shirts, 
and the cuffs of their shirts should come one-half 
inch from the sleeve of their jackets.
To complete the professional look, Martin sug
gested wearing black shoes for any color suit and a 
tie with a repeating pattern.
The tie is just meant to be an accessory. When 
you make a first impression, you dont want some
one staring at your neck  you want them staring 
at you, said Richard Istvan, the store manager at 
Jos. A. Bank, a mens clothing store downtown that 
provided the mens outfits in the events fashion 
show.
Martin also noted that the tip of a mans tie 
should just reach the top of his belt  not below, 
and certainly not above.
According to Frick, CMBA and the Career Center 
hold several similar workshops in an effort to train 
students for the job market, held include a dining 
etiquette course and interviewing techniques.

University 
promotes cam
pus recycling
RecycleMania 
and the green 
initiative
by Kathy Chiapaikeo
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon uses 
45 boxes of paper a day. In one 
year alone, that sums up to 
11,500 cases, 57 million sheets, 
or 12 truckloads of paper. Bill 
Cravis artwork, Printing to 
the Sky, installed around the 
flagpole on the Cut last week, 
consisted of approximately 
400boxes, with each empty copy 
paper box originally containing 
5000 sheets of paper; it repre
sents only two weeks worth of 
paper used on campus.
Last year, Carnegie Mellon re
cycled 180 tons of paper, and the 
University recently participated 
in RecycleMania, a 10-week 
recycling competition to see 
which university can collect the 
largest amount of recyclables 
and have the highest recycling 
rate. RecycleMania has helped 
increase student awareness in 
recycling and waste reduction. 
By making recycling a fun yet 
competitive event, universities 
nationwide have participated 
in saving the environment by 
coming up with creative and 
collaborative ways to recycle on 
campus. The university that re
cycles the most wins. There are 
many ways to gain recognition, 
from designing posters to win
ing trophies.
Carnegie Mellon ranked 38th 
out of 45 in overall source reduc
tion and recycling. In a recycling 
event, Carnegie Mellon ranked 
53rd out of 87, collecting 17.68 
pounds of recyclables per per
son. In another event to find the

Allan Newell (left) and Herbert Simon developed the first computing 
program in 1956, at whatwas then known as Carnegie Tech.
by Todd Blose
Junior Staffwriter
This weekend the computer 
science program celebrated 
its 50th anniversary. The 
four-day event, dubbed CS50, 
commended the innovation and 
prominence that has marked the 
past half-century in computer
science research.
In the summer of 1956, the 
first computer at the University 
was an IBM model 650. The IBM 
was delivered to the basement 
of the business school, and soon 
afterward the dean announced 
the founding of the Computation 
Center, to be headed by profes
sor Alan Perlis. The center soon 
gained much admiration and
praise as a premier research lo
cation. Successive innovations 
led the program to be one of the 
top institutions in the country. 
CS50 highlighted all of this past 
excellence and gave insight into 
what the future holds for the pro
gram.
The CS50 celebration was co
ordinated and 
prepared by 
Deborah Har
ris, who devoted 
her time to en
suring the rec
ognition of all 
that has been 
accomplished.
Randal E. Bry
ant, the dean 
of the School of 
Computer Sci
ence, reflected 
on the event:
Preparingforthis 
event has given
me the chance ___________
to look over 
and learn about the research and 
education conducted here since 
the pioneering days of Newell, 
Simon, and Perlis, said Bryant. 
I have been very impressed by 
the depth and vision of their 
work, and I am very thankful 
that they helped create the field 
and the organization that has be
come my career.
Over 500 computer science 
researchers and others who have 
contributed to the program gath
ered to recognize the triumphs 
of their coworkers. Bryant com
mented that in preparation for 
the event, he was given the op
portunity to look into the past 
and gain an even greater appre
ciation for the foresight of our 
founders.
Goverrior Edward Rendell 
even paid tribute by discussing 
how significant the contribu
tions from the school have been 
for the field of computer science. 
He mentioned how the program 
will, from a technological per
spective, help shape the new 
Pennsylvania. Alumni speakers 
followed, as well as the introduc
tion of five new inductees to the 
Robot Hall of Fame.
The past 
50 years in 
computer 
science at our 
university have 
been marked by 
excellence and 
prominance.
A variety of activities were
organized to recognize the
achievements of students,
faculty, and alumni. The second-to-last day of the event, 
for example, included the 12th 
annual Mobot Races, in which 
competitors were given the 
opportunity to develop their own 
autonomous 
robotic agents. 
The develop
ment of these 
robots re
quired exten
sive effort and 
demonstrates 
the creativity 
that continues 
to thrive in the 
School of Com
puter Science 
today. (For a 
deeper look 
at this years 
Mobot races,
_____________ see the Pillbox
section, page
22.)
The computer science 
school also highlighted a 
preview of the new, 209,000- 
square-foot Gates Center for 
Computer Science, to be built by 
2009; the innovation prospects 
to follow its construction were 
also discussed. The Gates Cen
ter was funded in part by Bill 
and Melinda Gates, among other 
donors, and will be devoted to 
broadening the horizons of com
puter science. This portion of 
the event gave insight as to how 
increased dedication to research 
will continue to benefit com
puter science.
The past 50 years in computer 
science at our university have 
been marked by excellence and 
prominence. This weekend, the 
campus community paid tribute 
to those who have made the pro
gram what it is today. President 
Jared L. Cohon remarked that 
their impact is felt across nearly 
every discipline and field of en
deavor, wherever people seek to 
solve complex problems. CS50 
brought to attention all of these 
contributions, which cannot eas
ily be forgotten.
Energy drinks: Good for you tonight, bad for you tomorrow
by Simran Grover
Junior Staffwriter
Weve all been there. Its 2 am 
and youre exhausted after a day 
of classes,, meetings, and extra
curricular activities; that exam 
is only six and a half hours away. 
You grab a Red Bull or a Boost 
to keep yourself awake. Luckily, 
you are rejuvenated with a burst 
of energy and alertness.
The burst of energy comes 
primarily from caffeine, but en
ergy drinks are also loaded with 
sugar. Sugar comes in the form 
of glucuronolactone, sucrose, 
and glucose. Some drinks also 
contain an extract from guarana 
seeds which works to stimu
late the central nervous system 
in a fashion similar to the way 
caffeine stimulates the body. 
Guarana seeds also have thermo
genic properties, which increase 
the bodys metabolism through 
the generation of heat.
A soft drink usually has 19 to 
25 grams of sugar in each eightounce serving. Energy drinks on 
average contain more than this. 
Red Bull, for example, contains 
27 grams of sugar per serving of 
250 milliliters (a little over eight 
ounces). This can be very dan
gerous, for an overload of sugar 
can lead to gastric emptying. 
The body becomes dehydrated, 
which prevents metabolized 
sugar from entering the blood
stream. This often results in 
nausea and vomiting. So when 
you are thirsty, think twice be
fore grabbing an energy drink to
rehydrate yourself.
You can compare various 
energy drinks to carbonated 
beverages in that they dont of
fer much in terms of nutrients to 
the body. Like coffee or soda, the 
effects of an energy drink wear 
off within a couple of hours and 
the craving for another one in
creases.
Many students at Carnegie 
Mellon are attracted, but not ad
dicted, to energy drinks. I have

How Things Work: Voice over Internet Protocol
Saravana Sivasakaran
When was the last time you 
tried shopping for a phone card 
to get in touch with a loved 
one abroad? As the digital age 
continues to rise, you can wave 
goodbye to long distance ana
log phone calls and turn your 
attention to a cheaper and easier 
way of communication. Voice 
over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, is 
a method for taking analog audio 
signals, like the kind you hear 
when you talk on the phone, and 
turning them into digital data 
that can be transmitted over the 
Internet.
How is this useful? VoIP can 
turn a standard Internet connec
tion into a way to place free phone 
calls. The practical upshot of this 
is that by using some of the free 
VoIP software that is available to 
make Internet phone calls, you 
are bypassing the phone com
pany and its charges entirely.
So how do you get started? 
There are three ways by which 
you can make use of VoIP. The 
most common way is by con
necting your standard phone to 
you computer or your Internet 
connection using an analog-todigital converter. This is a very 
straightforward setup and youll 
be ready to harness VoIP in min
utes. IPphones, on the other hand,
look just like normal phones, ex
cept they connect directly to your 
router and have all the hardware 
and software necessary to get 
started. But the easiest way to 
use VoIP, especially for students, 
is through computer-to-computer interactions. All you need 
is a special type of VoIP software, 
a microphone, speakers, and a 
fast Internet connection. Apart 
from the normal monthly ISP 
fee, there is usually no charge for 
computer-to-computer calls, no 
matter the distance.
Let us take the third case as 
an example to better understand 
how VoIP operates. When using a 
computer to transmit audio, the 
computer might compress these 
sounds so that they require less 
space and will record only a lim
ited frequency range. There are 
a number of ways to compress 
audio, the algorithm for which is 
referred to as a compressor/de
compressor, or simply codec. 
Many codecs exist for a variety 
of applications, such as movies 
and sound recordings. For VoIP, 
the codecs are optimized for 
compressing voice, which sig
nificantly reduces the bandwidth 
used in transferring an uncom
pressed audio stream.
Once the sound is recorded by 
the computer and compressed 
into small samples, the samples 
are collected together into larger
chunks and placed into data 
packets for transmission over 
the IP network. This process 
is referred to as packetization. 
Generally, a single IP packet will 
contain 10 or more milliseconds 
of audio, with 20 or 30 millisec
onds being most common. The 
packets are then received by the 
recipient computer, where they 
go through a similar process to 
get the audio in a format that can 
be played by the receiver.
Of course there is much more to 
VoIP than just sending the audio 
packets over the Internet. There 
must also be an agreed proto
col for how computers find each 
other and how information is ex
changed in order to allow packets 
to ultimately flow between the 
communicating devices. There 
must also be an agreed format, 
called the payload format, for the 
contents of the media packets.
The Forrester Research Group 
predicts that nearly 5 million 
U.S. households will have VoIP 
phone service by the end of 2006. 
Perhaps the biggest attractions or 
VoIP for home users are the low 
price and high flexibility. Also 
in the works are Wi-Fi IP phones 
which will allow subscribing call
ers to make VoIP calls from any 
Wi-Fi hot spot.

VoIP, a good place to begin is

British officials lift 
bird flu restrictions
British officials have lifted 
some bird flu restrictions 
implemented after the discovery 
of a dead swan found in Scodand 
that tested positive for the H5N1 
virus on April 5. Restrictions that 
have been lifted include limits 
on the movement of poultry and 
eggs in eastern Scotland, since no 
outbreaks have been found since 
the discovery of the infected swan. 
The three-kilometer protection 
zone established has also been 
lifted; however, a 10-kilometer 
control zone that prevents the 
movement of poultry and birds 
will remain until May 1.

FDA doubts use 
of marijuana for 
medicinal purposes
TheFoodandDrugAdministration 
is declaring that no sound 
scientific studies supported 
medical use of marijuana for 
treatment in the United States, 
and no animal or human data 
supported the safety or efficacy 
of marijuana for general medical 
use. According to the FDA, there 
are alternative medications' in 
existence for treatment of many 
of the proposed uses of smoked 
marijuana. Marijuana has been 
used to treat nausea induced 
by chemotherapy for cancer 
patients, and has been endorsed 
by the National Academy of 
Sciences despite the lack of 
scientific evidence.

Liquor for lilacs?
Cornell University horticulturists 
state that giving potted plants 
diluted amounts of hard liquor 
can actually be beneficial. 
Researchers believe that the 
addition of diluted alcohol stunts 
the growth of stems on daffodils, 
but has no negative effect on 
blossoms. Consequendy, daffodils 
do not fall over due to excessive 
growth of stems. Extensive 
studies have been performed 
testing the effectiveness of 
vodka, whiskey, white rum, 
gold tequila, mint schnapps, 
red and white wine, and pale 
lager beer on paperwhites. Wine 
and beer were not effective, 
most likely due to their high 
sugar content. Regarding hard 
liquor, concentrations ranging 
between four and six percent 
effectively stunted the growth 
of stems on paperwhites, while 
concentrations above 10 percent 
proved to be toxic.

Judge rules for 
California stem cell 
agency
A state judge quashed two 
lawsuits challenging a $3 billion 
stem cell institute in California. 
The lawsuits challenged the 
legitimacy of the agency and tried 
to negate its constitutionality; 
lawyers tried to prove that the 
institute violated state law 
since it was not actually a state 
agency. This argument fell apart 
once the judge pointed out that 
Proposition 71, a voter-approved 
law that created the agency, was 
beyond any doubt constitutional. 
The state ruling becomes official 
on May 1, which will ensure 
that $300 million will remain 
available for stem cell researchers 
in California. Proposition 71 
was supported by 59 percent of 
voters, which actively countered 
President Bushs restrictive 
policies regarding stem cell 
research that greatly limits 
federal funding.

CMU aims for more efficient recycling program
RECYCLING, from A5
school producing the smallest amount of mu
nicipal solid waste, Carnegie Mellon ranked 
27th out of 43 with 116.97 pounds of waste 
per person per ten-week period.
Barb Kviz, environmental coordinator for 
Facilities Management Services, stated, I 
think there is room for improvements in our 
recycling program and welcome input from 
the campus community as to how we can im
prove the system.
Although Carnegie Mellon is efficient in 
recycling, there are still many ways stu
dents and faculty can continue to improve 
recycling rates. The pay-to-print initiative 
for students has greatly reduced the number 
of paper printouts. Student and faculty are 
also asked to take their office paper to recy
cling bins conveniently located throughout 
the buildings on and around campus as well 
as in residence halls. Carnegie Mellons En
vironmental Practices Committee works on 
developing plans to expand environmental 
practice programs on campus.
Cravis said his artwork is a campuswide 
collaborative public art work, because the 
Carnegie Mellon community has contributed 
to each and every box that was on the Cut.
Carnegie Mellon continues to promote 
waste reduction and recycling. The University 
plans to meet the Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) requirements 
for all new construction on campus. LEED is 
a voluntary, consensus-based national stan
dard for developing high-performance, sus
tainable buildings.
Other activities on campus being initiated 
in order to promote green practices and en
hance awareness of the environment include 
a student-initiated project to grow flowers on 
the roofs of such buildings as Hamerschlag 
Hall and Doherty Hall. A green roof protects 
the buidling from UV rays, reduces cooling 
and heating energy consumption, and de
creases stormwater waste streams. With the 
help of green practices and the campus com
munity, the future holds much promise for 
the implementation of more innovative ways 
to save the environment.

drink energy drinks when I need 
energy, not on a regular basis or

a sophomore business major, 
has a different take on energy 
drinks. I dont believe in energy

through food intake rather than 
depending on synthetic drinks. 
If I need to stay up at night to 
study, I will drink water.
Energy drinks are not the 
optimal drinks to quench your 
thirst as a result of dehydra
tion. Caffeine, like alcohol, is a 
diuretic that promotes fluid loss. 
A popular combination amongst 
college students at bars and 
nightclubs is the energy drink
and alcohol mix. Red Bull and 
vodka, for instance, is a hit with 
many drinkers. This cocktail is 
potentially dangerous because 
energy drinks are stimulants 
and alcohol is a depressant. 
Excessive overloading of the 
body with energy drinks and al
cohol can lead to heart failure.
There has been extensive new 
development of energy drinks 
that can give a person an energy 
boost without loading the drink 
with sugar, although the caf
feine remains and can still cause 
potential health problems. New 
products include Red Bull Sugarfree, XLER8, and XS. Gautam 
Daswani, a sophomore business 
major, said that XS tastes good. 
I am comfortable having it, it has 
no sugar whatsoever, and it still 
gives energy.
Although energy drinks are a 
potential solution to tiredness, 
they can cause health problems 
due to excessive caffeine and 
sugar. In the future, be sure to 
think twice before choosing the 
energy drink dujour.

THE TARTAN24 April 2006
What the PSO can do to make 
classical music mainstreamFromTheEditorialBoard
structure, etiquette, and atmosphere 
will remain a solid part of the concert 
experience. For high-culture elitists like 
me, this is a very pleasing thought. The 
trip to Heinz Hall for a night with the 
PSO is a predictable and comfortable 
experience where passion for the music 
makes everything worthwhile.
For these reasons, any new steps 
taken by these organizations must have 
an orchestra-centered plan that will not 
marginalize the performers, because 
rejecting the "centuries of tradition re
moves an important part of music cul
ture. However, if orchestras want to rein 
in some of the huge youth market, they 
must continue branching out. This is a 
delicate business, because to innovate, 
orchestras have to remain the same in 
more adaptive ways.
Last May, the Los Angeles Philhar
monic (LAP) gave an unorthodox 
performance that embraced orchestra 
traditions and brought in many new 
faces. The LAP performed the American 
debut of Dear Friends, a concert of 
music from the wildly popular video 
game series Final Fantasy. The first Dear 
Friends concert sold out three days after 
tickets went on sale, and its following 
tour filled concert halls to the brim 
across America. Two new video game 
symphony tours  Play! and Video 
Games Live  will debut this summer.
Video game concerts will draw a spe
cialized audience, but it still will be a 
new audience. These video game sym1 
phony concerts could very well give 
a first taste of the classical medium 
for many audience members. Orches
tras, with a fresh audience, have a fresh 
chance to show how wonderful the 
symphony experience is. With massive 
amounts of advertising and communi
cation on a youth-oriented level, these 
concerts could easily inspire new faces 
to become regular faces.
However, these video game programs 
have not been readily taken up by the 
top-tier orchestras. The Houston Sym
phony Orchestra will perform in a stop 
of the Video Games Live tour, but the 
countrys best talents, performing in 
cities like Pittsburgh and New York, 
have not whole-heartedly jumped on 
the video game symphony band wagon.
Outside of the video game genre, or
chestras can step out of tradition for 
more unique concerts. Perhaps one of" 
the most famous collaborative projects 
between an orchestra and a modern en
semble is the album Master of Puppets. 
Metallica and the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra released an incredibly 
popular and very well-engineered album 
that represents a successful synthesis of 
the old and the new.
The PSO had an excellent chance to 
pursue a project along those lines. The 
orchestra brought in Jennifer Higdon as 
the resident composer this season, and 
she wrote works specifically for the PSO 
that both showcased the musical voices 
in the ensemble and showed how ap
pealing new works can be.
Higdon readily admits to a childhood 
based around rock music, yet her works 
exclusively feature classical ensembles. 
She also frequently calls her music 
accessible. During one concert interims-7 
sion, I asked her why she did not write 
for more modern and accessible ensem-! 
bles if she loved them both so much.
Its just what people keep asking me 
for, she replied. Does this mean that 
the PSO had the chance to premiere 
an immensely .popular set of pieces like 
Master of Puppets'? I think it does mean 
that, and it also means that the PSO'" 
could have taken a new orchestra-cen
tered path that would have made more 
young people regular concert-goers.
Matthew McKee
High-culture elitists probably wish 
they did not have to recognize this, but 
the youth market is huge. The college 
market alone has over $200 billion in 
spending power, and to tap that, old 
and venerable symphony orchestras' use 
novel methods, but they still have a long 
way to go. Orchestras, to retain their 
importance in American society, must 
always stay true to tradition but must 
continue pursuing ways to branch out.
Orchestras have already implemented 
some smart techniques. The pops con
certs performed by most orchestras 
employ an impressive range of styles
 from jazz to Annie  that people can 
relate to. These concerts bring in a lot of 
money for orchestras. Also, if youve vis
ited the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
(PSO) website recently, youve noticed 
a new set of blogs written by orchestra 
members and first-time concertgoers. 
These are unique records of experi
ences with the world-class orchestra in 
a format accessible to the many youths 
addicted to the Internet. However, or
chestras can do a lot more to attract a 
bigger part of that $200 billion.
Modern marketers know that youth 
culture represents a huge potential mar
ket, and new powerful selling strategies 
take advantage of this all the time. For 
instance, the marketers of the energy 
drink Red Bull have devised ingenious 
ways to reach college students. On some

punch-card-powered calculation en
gines that would fill a standard double 
in New House. Since then, Carnegie 
Mellons computer science program has 
seen plenty of firsts. The school offered 
the first introductory-level computer 
programming class in the country in 
1958. Our Robotics Institute designed 
and built the first direct-drive arm proto
type  a forerunner to modern robotic 
arms  in 1981. Carnegie Mellon even 
became the first wired campus in 1983 
with a predecessor of the Andrew File 
System.
In 1990, a chess-playing computer de
signed here was the first in history to beat 
a grand master. Three years later, a re
searcher developed the theories behind 
what ended up being known worldwide 
as bullet-time; the research enabled the 
Eagle Cam coverage of Super Bowl
XXXV. A computer science graduate de
veloped Lycos, the first mainstream Web 
search engine, in 1994. In 1997, a team 
of students won their division in the first 
ever robo-soccer tournament in Japan. 
The first wireless campus network in the 
country was installed here in 2000 and 
just two years ago, Sandstorm beat out 
14 other competitors in the first DARPA 
Grand Challenge.
The School of Computer Science 
consistently ranks in the top three 
worldwide. Students in SCS are proud 
of what they do, and for good reason. 
Simply put: When people hear the name 
Carnegie Mellon, theyre likely to 
think of our computer science program. 
This week, you should feel proud, too, 
because computer science students are 
making breakthroughs that will impact 
all of our lives in CSs next 50 years.
Despite the chartreuse scar the com
puter science 50th anniversary tent left 
on the Cut last week, we should all show 
our computer science department heart
felt appreciation. Heres why:
Its been 50 years since the first com
puter was installed at Carnegie Tech: a 
state-of-the-art IBM 650. The IBM 650 
was a massive contraption hardly ad
vanced enough to be called a computer
 IBM referred to it as an automatic cal
culator. Nevertheless, the 650 was the 
centerpiece of Herbert Simons brandnew Computation Center. One of the first 
orders of business at the Computation 
Center was to study artificial intelligence
 a field that the University still leads 
50 years later.
Of course, Carnegie Mellon students 
know all too well that computer science 
has come a long way from the oversized,
Orchestras... must 
always stay true to 
tradition but must 
continue pursuing 
ways to branch out
campuses, they pay people to walk 
around libraries and distribute books 
titled Modern Information Retention 
Techniques. These books, which are 
really plastic models, open to reveal two 
cans of Red Bull.
Marketing itself is key to filling more 
chairs in the concert hall. Its difficult 
to advertise to the evolving ADD society 
where deaf iPod-wearing consumers of 
culture industry represent even more 
buying power than ever. Those who re
fuse to change approaches to marketing 
can easily be pushed to the margins of 
the economy. Red Bull has harnessed the 
fickle youth culture through stimulat
ing, adaptive marketing with character 
and flair. Orchestras can do this, too, 
and keep both old and new audiences 
coming. Strategic marketing appeals to 
the young while keeping the traditional. 
The PSO places ads in student newspa
pers, but it can also easily advertise on 
Facebook and on more campus posters 
that catch the eye of the college student 
whose attention goes five different ways 
at once.
But can symphony orchestras commit 
themselves completely to appealing to 
the young and the restless? Classical 
music performers depend on a com
pletely different age group for financial 
support. A typical listener of a Chopin 
concerto is about 55 years old, and his 
or her cultural preferences differ greatly 
from the student drinking Red Bull. Or
ganizations like the PSO receive most of 
their funding from foundations, endow
ments, and older audiences who see 
orchestra concerts as an escape from 
popular culture. Many classical music 
listeners feel that a live performance is 
a haven from the outside, the world of 
graffiti and rap music.
Because orchestras depend on these 
audiences, traditional concert program
Candidates apathy no better than voters
In case you didnt know, elections for 
student body president (SBP) and vicepresident (SBVP), vice-president for 
finance (VPF), and Student Senate are 
today and tomorrow. Three pairs of can
didates are running for president and 
vice-president; you can read all about 
them and their platforms.starting on the 
front page. But something is amiss.
We are witnessing the last breaths of 
this student government. At no point in 
recent memory has the situation been so 
grave. Without a minor miracle, there is 
no way the student representatives who 
obtain office in the elections will reflect 
the will of the students.
Three pairs of candidates are running 
for SBP and SBVP. Based on the member
ship of their respective Facebook groups, 
Karl Sjogren and Andrea Hamilton are 
the early favorites, Dan Horbatt and Al
len Eaton are nipping at their heels, and 
Justin Berka and Kelly Duncan are trail
ing far behind (however, these numbers 
are constantly changing). Predicting the 
results of an election using Facebook 
group membership should be considered 
silly and meaningless, but this election is 
so fraught with problems that its results 
may be even more meaningless.
Senate and the current candidate 
teams have mucked up this years elec
tion process beyond reason. Senate 
failed to appoint an Elections Board on 
time. The appointment was made so 
late that the boards first decision was to 
postpone the elections by two weeks, so 
candidates would have 30 days to pre
pare as mandated by the elections rules.
After the official dates were publi
cized, every member of the student
body had the opportunity to fill out a 
petition and run for any office, but only 
three candidate teams signed up for the 
SPB/SPVP pair, and only two candidates 
for vice-president for finance. All eight 
people are current Student Senators, a 
problem in itself. Its hard to say whether 
this is due to general apathy or a lack 
of publicity about the opportunity, but 
publicizing the elections was the respon
sibility of the Senate Communications 
Committee, led by Andrea Hamilton 
with help from Karl Sjogren.
Beyond this candidate pools lack of 
diversity, none of those who did decide 
to run have done much at all to pub
licize their campaigns. Only one pair
 communications experts Sjogren and 
Hamilton  has a website, and it was 
only launched in the last week.
Aside from that, none of the three 
pairs have postered around campus at 
all, and most of them missed a golden 
opportunity to blanket Sweepstakes and 
Midway with campaign materials dur
ing Spring Carnival.
While all three pairs of candidates 
were grudgingly willing to talk with The 
Tartan about their platforms, they were 
less willing to provide official platforms 
to the Elections Board in a timely fash
ion. These official statements from each 
candidate (or team of candidates) are 
supposed to be included with their peti
tions, but every student body president 
and vice-president candidate ticket sub
mitted their petition without a platform. 
None of the them submitted this seem
ingly important information until this 
weekend  weeks behind schedule.
Perhaps most indicative of this lack of
communication is how a Tartan reporter 
had to personally inform one of the pres
idential candidates during an interview 
that there were in fact not one, but two 
different candidates for VPF. To make 
matters worse, the forgotten VPF can
didate in question was Kirk Higgins, the 
only one of the eight people involved in 
the executive elections who has  rela
tively speaking  done a decent job of 
getting the word out and postering.
Higgins, in fact, has been on top of 
everything throughout the campaign; 
additionally, he has been a highly re
sponsible chair of the Funding and 
Recognition Committee and has been 
one of the few members of the Joint 
Funding Committee who has acted with 
total integrity and accountability. He 
is the only candidate we unanimously 
endorse running for any executive 
position.
Overall, due to utter lack of prepara
tion by Senate and the complete lack 
of communication from the majority of 
candidates, The Tartan refuses to en
dorse any of the candidates for president 
or vice-president. Fearing dismal voter 
turnout, we call for the Elections Board 
to invalidate any results of this election 
if less than 25 percent of eligible voters 
participate. We want to see an election 
where the candidates show they care. In 
the event of a second election, we want 
to see real campaigning and not just the 
weak faade of campus politicking.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 24, 2006
Unified language does not a unified nation make
Andrew Peters
An April 14 USA Today opinion article on 
(illegal Mexican immigration by Alabama 
resident D. Ezell read, If people want to 
be in this country so badly, they need to 
assimilate and become American. This 
means following laws, being good citizens 
and speaking English.
Ezell voices concerns growing in every 
part of the country regarding the problems 
that immigration brings. And its no won
der  Americans have historically been 
very unhappy with immigration. From the 
get-go, our founding fathers, not sepa
rated by more than three generations from 
their immigrant ancestors, held prejudices 
against outsiders.
In the mid-18th century, Benjamin 
Franklin despised the Germans immi
grating to Philadelphia, saying that they 
are generally the most stupid of their 
nation.... Few of their children know Eng
lish. In the 1920s, historian Arthur M. 
Schlesinger wrote, The new immigration 
from Southern and Eastern Europe, with 
its lower standard of living and charac
teristic racial differences, has intensified 
many existing social problems and created 
a number of new ones.
The same thing is happening today.
Many people are concerned that with 
continued illegal immigration, the 
American Southwest will become a 
resistant linguistic and cultural region, 
much like Quebec is to Canada. They dont 
want American culture, community, and 
identity to be degraded by an influx of 
people who just dont care to assimilate.
Assimilation, though, takes time and is 
never a one-way street. If Ezell thinks that 
he is going to see the Mexican immigrants 
he lives around become American any 
time soon, he is mistaken.
Whether we like or not, immigrants 
have forced upon the U.S. a cultural ex
change. Like every group before them, 
Mexican immigrants are at once holding 
onto their heritage and being exposed to 
American culture. There is cultural mixing 
going on, not just in the Southwest, but in 
every major city in America.
While some anthropologists and politi
cal scientists have tried to draw sharp con
trasts between Mexican immigrants and 
European immigrants, recent research has 
not been kind to such theories. Studies 
have shown that successive generations of 
Mexican-Americans speak English more 
frequently. Their finding showed that 
60 percent of third-generation MexicanAmericans speak English in their homes, 
which is important because the home is 
the place they would be least likely to 
speak English. These findings indicate that 
the same slow process of Americaniza
tion is happening for Mexican immigrants 
as it has for every other immigrant group 
in American history.
The idea of requiring immigrants to 
speak English is not a bad one, but should 
not be promoted for the wrong reasons. 
Mandating that English be spoken in gov
ernment and legal discourse has merit. 
Streamlining government activities by 
using an official language can save the 
government time and money, and would 
avoid confusion.
Making immigrants speak Eng
lish because you dont want to be 
inconvenienced at the grocery store or 
because you find it un-American is not 
reasonable.
Citizens of the Southwest especially 
do not have the privilege of pretending 
that English is native to that region. The 
only reason America has a claim to the 
Southwest is because of the 1848 Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo. We beat Mexico in 
a war we engineered, and then we took all 
of the land that the Spanish colonists had 
stolen from the indigenous people 200 
years before. So, while a view of illegal 
Mexican immigrants as pilgrims to their 
homeland, which some have espoused, 
is a bit extreme, we must realize that 
the culture of that area has always been 
mixed.
I dont propose that we all learn Spanish 
to accommodate illegal immigrants, but 
dont forget that there are millions of legal 
native Spanish-speakers throughout the 
United States. Foreign language classes in 
middle and high school arent novelties; 
they are the tools to better communication 
in this country as well as abroad.
Instead of shouting at immigrants to be
more American, to fit in already, to stop 
being so damn different, perhaps there 
are things we can learn from them. Over 
time, the Mexican and American cultures 
will by necessity rub together enough that 
Mexicans will assimilate. Lets not under
estimate the power of American culture. It 
has already pervaded Mexico proper and 
much of the industrialized world. To think 
that immigrants pose a hostile threat to 
our identity as Americans is unfounded. 
They may pose a change to our identity, 
an alteration, a broadening of who we are, 
but they will not degrade what it is to be 
American. In actuality, they will become 
what it is to be America  a heterogeneous 
mixture of cultures and ideas.
I have not addressed some rather 
important economic aspects of immigra
tion because the immigration debate is 
usually framed around Social Security, 
welfare, and other legal issues. These very 
pertinent issues, however, tend to over
shadow concerns of identity, culture, and 
language. We can take a narrow view 
of assimilation, pretending that we can 
make all immigrants dress in khakis and 
shop at Wal-Mart, or we can realize that 
the cultural borderland between the U.S. 
and Mexico has been simmering for over a 
hundred years and is starting to boil over. 
But we dont need to fear and we dont 
need to jump to conclusions.

Comedy Centrals censorship is no laughing matter
Benjamin Hackett
Go ahead, Kyle; give us another 
one of your gay speeches. Jokes 
concerning the homotendant 
diatribes of one of their main 
characters aside, the time has 
come to give the creators of South 
Park their due. Two weeks ago 
South Park, the recent recipient 
of the Peabody Award  a very 
prestigious award for excellence 
in entertainment  took aim at 
those media sycophants prideless and spineless enough to stifle 
freedom of speech by caving in to 
hostile pressures.
The creators of South Park, 
Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have 
been pushing the envelope from 
all sides since the series went on 
the air. Parker and Stone have 
taken aim at all religions, sexes, 
ethnic groups, stereotypes, and 
general societal taboos. So, when 
they put together their latest 
two-part episode, tided Cartoon 
Wars, it is likely the last thing 
on their mind was the eventual 
censorship of their ideas.
Yet that is exactiy what Comedy 
Central decided was appropriate 
to do to one of its longest-running 
and most successful shows. The 
two-part episode was originally
intended to make fun of the 
Muslim riots over recent car
toon depictions of the prophet 
Muhammad. However, when 
Comedy Central decided to cen
sor the image, the creators of 
South Park turned their cannon of 
satire on their own network. And, 
in typical South Park fashion, the 
political discussion worked seam
lessly with their brand of humor
as socially repressive as a pre9/11 Afghanistan. Do not air the 
cartoon depiction of Muhammad. 
Oh, and by the way, end womens 
suffrage.
Of course, since Comedy 
Central is now in the business of 
censorship, one would assume 
that all potentially offensive ma
terial will be stricken from the 
network, posthaste. Yet, this is not
Hogwash, hooey, pfft, gag, spit, and 
shame on you, Comedy Central.
and biting satire.
Comedy Central defended its 
position, stating that in light of 
recent world events, we feel we 
made the right decision. Hog
wash, hooey, pfft, gag, spit, and 
shame on you, Comedy Central. 
Your decision to cave to obscene 
terror tactics of intimidation 
shows the danger now facing 
many other American institutions. 
Do we value our freedoms enough 
to fight for them? Comedy Cen
tral says no.
The nation must have missed 
the memo the Comedy Cen
tral execs received. The memo 
reads, and I quote: The United 
States of America has become
the case. Let us look at the recent 
South Park lineup on Comedy 
Central: Last Thursday, Cartman 
joins NAMBLA. For those of you 
who are not (yet?) members, that 
is the North American Man-Boy 
Love Association. Just this past 
week, Comedy Central aired A 
Million Little Fibers, an episode 
that contains pot smoking and 
the shooting of Oprahs anus and 
vagina.
Okay, so just to help out those 
at home keeping score, Comedy 
Central sees no problem with 
pedophilia, pot smoking, or the 
mutilation of the female anat
omy. Got it? Roger.
All right, so maybe pedophilia
and body mutilation are not 
as offensive as making fun of 
someones religion. On April 26, 
Comedy Central will re-air the 
South Park episode titled All 
About Mormons? This hysteri
cal episode takes rather large 
digs at Mormons, yet this episode 
will not be censored. Previously, 
nearly every ethnic, religious, 
and other group has had a little 
fun poked at it by South Park.
So in keeping score, Comedy 
Central does not mind pedophilia, 
pot smoking, mutilation, public 
masturbation, killing children, 
talking fecal matter, and Jesus 
throwing fisticuffs. Nor does 
the network mind making fun 
of Jews, Catholics, Protestants, 
Mormons, Buddhists, Scientolo
gists, gays, the poor, the rich, 
the Chinese, Canadians, Ameri
cans, Arabs, blacks, whites, or 
Hispanics. As long as any depic
tion of the prophet Muhammad 
is kept off the air, everything else 
is peachy keen.
Smacking yourself in the head? 
Yeah, me too.
To make the absurdity all the 
more clear, the ending of the re
cent two-part episode contained 
a few images that, while offen
sive, Comedy Central declined 
to censor. Proving their point 
while outlining the absurdity of 
the Comedy Central decision, the
creators of South Park went above 
and beyond their normal levels 
of satire  humorously  in the 
episodes final scene.
After the episode depicts the 
Fox network showing the cartoon 
of the prophet Muhammad, al 
Qaeda leaders produce and show 
a retaliatory cartoon of their 
own. In this cartoon, Jesus and 
President Bush defecate on one 
another. Then both men, joined 
by an array of others, defecate 
on the American flag and on 
themselves.
Characters give speeches 
throughout depicting the im
portance of freedom of speech. 
However, in a telling metaphor 
early on in the two-part episode, 
the residents of South Park are 
given a choice between fighting 
for free speech and sticking their 
heads in the sand. They all choose 
to stick their heads in the sand.
To the creators of South Park, 
kudos. They stood up to the 
network and fought for the prin
ciples of freedom of speech. To 
quote South Park character Kyle 
Broflovski, Either its all okay, or 
none of it is. Do the right thing.
Come down to BenjaminHackett. 
com and have yourselves a time.

pens to be promoting censorship,

Perspectives 
JFC moves 
in the right 
direction
Nicholas J. Scocozzo
Hello, all. It has been some time 
since I last wrote in this column, 
and I would like to thank Tom 
and The Tartan for allowing me, 
the vice-president for finance, 
this space this week.
Last week, the Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) presented its 
final recommendation for stu
dent organization subsidies of 
the 2006-2007 academic year 
to Student Senate and Gradu
ate Student Assembly (GSA). You 
can see the subsidies for each 
group in this issue of The Tartan, 
and detailed reports are online 
at budgets.stusen.org. These 
recommendations come after a 
semester-long process of working 
with 129 groups through 11 JFC 
representatives, four weeks of re
viewing line items and creating 
our first recommendation, and a 
hectic week of appeals meetings. 
I would like to thank my commit
tee for their help.
The joint meeting of Senate 
and GSA on Wednesday at 4:30 
pm in Doherty Hall 2210 is the 
last step for JFC. If you would 
like to voice your opinion on the 
budgets or process, you may do 
so during audience participation 
at the start of the meeting.
This has been a year of change 
for the JFC. Starting with funding 
eligibility renewal every fall, JFC 
now reviews the effect of each 
group on campus by examining 
its spending and their events. We 
started this process last fall, and 
next year the full process, to
gether with Oracle account data 
(even now being used on a larger 
scale), will help us to get a better 
idea about groups for the spring 
budgeting process. By adding 
more forms to fill out, groups 
will have to spend more time on 
paperwork than activities, which 
is against student governments 
purpose. However, a balance can 
be found here.
Blanket statistics about the 
budgets can be misleading due to 
special cases. While there are dif
fering amounts of value students 
get from different activities, 
there are base costs to do certain 
things, such as having a radio 
station. Comparing groups bud
gets every, year can be difficult 
because of capital upgrades, such 
as the Frames much-needed 
wall renovations. There is work 
in progress to make it easier to 
separate expenses (like overhead 
from one-time capital purchases) 
for review.
One last note: Student govern
ment elections for student body 
president and vice-president for 
finance, and undergraduate Sen
ators, are today and tomorrow. 
Remember to go to elections.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Catching onto the fantasy sports craze
Doug Fricker
Its not enough to just be a 
sports fan anymore. We need 
something more interactive that 
lets us be in the drivers seat 
calling the shots.
Enter fantasy sports. For those 
of you who dont know, fantasy 
sports puts you into the role 
of manager and lets you pick 
and draft real-life players for a 
fictional team. You then use the 
real-life statistics of those play
ers to determine which team 
in a fantasy league is doing the 
best.
Yahoo! Sports, Sportsline, and 
ESPN give people the option to 
create a team in fantasy base
ball, football, hockey, soccer, 
golf, tennis, and auto racing.
Fantasy cricket is also avail
able in the United Kingdom, 
and you can imagine how into 
fantasy cricket some people will 
get...
Bob: Did you see that cricket 
match between Derbyshire and 
Worcestershire last week? When 
Sutton stumped late in the match, 
my yelling nearly woke the entire 
neighborhood I was so happy. 
Those 50points helped me win.
Tom: Lucky for you. I forgot to 
put him in my lineup last week. 
I ended up losing badly because 
of all those wickets taken while 
Derbyshire was bowling.
Magazine writer and editor 
Daniel Okrent is credited as the 
mastermind behind the concept 
of fantasy baseball. He pitched 
the idea to some friends in 1980 
when dining at La Rtisserie 
Franaise in Manhattan.
The real innovation behind 
Rtisserie League Baseball is 
not so much the concept of let
ting you trade, draft, and form
fake teams (something good 
old baseball cards could do), 
but having you draft teams from 
an active list of Major League 
players, forcing you to make de
cisions like a real manager faced 
with the uncertainty of players 
performance and health.
The fate of your team relies 
on your players statistics during 
the ongoing season as opposed 
to statistics from previous sea
sons.
Over the past 25 years, with 
the advent of the Internet, 
fantasy sports have become 
extremely popular, as more 
than 15 million Americans 
play fantasy sports, estimates 
the Fantasy Sports Trade 
Association.
Fantasy football, with over 
10 million participants, has 
surpassed baseball as the most 
played fantasy sport. The ma
jority of participants are male, 
35-45 years old, and have aver
age yearly salaries of $89,000.
Fantasy sports are a good way 
to stay up-to-date with whats 
going on in each sport. You 
might not normally care when 
the San Francisco 49ers play the 
Arizona Cardinals on Monday 
Night Football; however, if 
youve got Cardinals wide re
ceiver Anquan Boldin and 49ers 
quarterback Alex Smith in your 
lineup, you suddenly transform 
into their biggest fans.
You become glued to the 
television for every snap, and 
whenever Boldin makes a catch, 
you cheer as if you were his own 
father, tears streaming down 
your face.
As for Alex Smith, well, 
youve got problems if you 
have Alex Smith and his mea
sly 40.8 QB rating on your 
team, so dont be surprised
with his zero-touchdown and 
three-interception perfor
mance.
Some fantasy sports can get 
expensive. According to re
search done by the University 
of Mississippi, in 2003, the av
erage fantasy baseball player 
spent approximately $180 to 
participate.
Many fantasy sports websites 
let you play for free, including 
Yahoo! Sports, so many fantasy 
gamers play for bragging rights 
instead of money.
Fantasy sports are a fun way to 
stay in touch and compete with 
friends and family, as you can 
create your own leagues with 
the option of playing against 
complete strangers or with good 
friends.
Fantasy sports have a dark 
side, however, as they have 
the ability to turn the friendly, 
casual fan into a diehard, cut
throat enthusiast obsessed with 
winning. No longer interested 
in just a favorite team or player, 
this person analyzes every as
pect of every player to gain an 
advantage to make his team bet
ter. There are horror stories of 
people putting so much time 
into fantasy sports that it gets in 
the way of their daily lives, and 
its been known to ruin friend
ships and relationships.
If you find yourself spend
ing more than an hour or two 
a week updating your fantasy 
teams, your grades are slipping, 
and youre not getting any sleep, 
take a step back and look at the 
big picture.
Youll quickly realize that 
youve got a lot of money riding 
on that fantasy team, so youd 
better buckle down and spend 
more time putting it in a posi
tion to win it all.

Sweet success for Carnegie Mellon tennis at UAA championship

Sheena Davis (pictured above) and Samantha Schultzs doubles win on Saturday helped the ladies beat Chicago.
by Adam Lazarus
Junior Staffwriter
This past weekend, the 
Carnegie Mellons, mens and 
womens tennis teams both com
peted in the University Athletic 
Association Championships held 
at Emory University in Atlanta. 
Both teams turned in solid per
formances, as the womens team 
grabbed second place while the 
mens team brought home third.
The women, ranked 12th 
nationally and seeded second 
among the eight teams in the 
conference, began the tourna
ment on Friday by breezing past 
Brandeis University. The Tartans 
won all nine matches  six 
singles and three doubles  that 
they competed in.
The shutout set up a semifinal 
match with number-15-ranked 
University of Chicago. Senior 
Alison Liu (7-5, 6-1) and soph
omore Samantha Schultz (6-3, 
7-5) each won their singles 
matches. And just as they had 
the day before, Carnegie Mellon 
swept the three doubles matches: 
Sophomore Amy Staloch and 
junior Mona Iyer defeated their 
opponents 8-2, and Schultz and 
first-year Sheena David won 9-8 
(7-4). Liu and first-year Kelly 
Namakura rounded out the 
doubles play by beating their 
Chicago opponents 8-2.
Our doubles play was awe
some this weekend, said head 
coach Andrew Girard. The girls 
have worked hard all week, and 
during the matches they commu
nicated a lot; they were supporting 
each other all the time. It was just 
great teamwork.
The teams 5-2 win over the 
Maroons sent the Tartans into the 
UAA championship match, where
they faced the number-one team 
in Division III and the tourna
ments host, Emory University.
Again, the womens team ex
celled in the doubles matches as 
both Staloch and Iyer and Liu and 
Namakura each downed their 
opponents 8-4 and 9-8 (7-5), 
respectively. However, in singles, 
Emory swept the women in all 
six matches, as the Tartans took 
second-place in the tournament. 
Despite the finals loss, the team 
won a place in Carnegie Mellons 
record book.
It was the best finish in school 
history, Girard said. That was 
one of the goals we had going 
into this weekend was to finish in 
the top two and we did that.
The mens team also left 
Atlanta with a piece of school 
history.
Seeded sixth, the Tartans drew 
the third seed and the 29thranked team in the nation, the 
University of Chicago, for their 
first-round opponent.
First-year Yirun Liu, sopho
more Andrew. Clearfield, juniors 
Jordan Koslosky and Anthony 
Robinson, and senior Carl Yang 
all won their singles matches, 
while Clearfield and sophomore 
Stephen Kuhn triumphed over 
their Chicago counterparts 8-3 
in their doubles match. The 5-2 
team score gave Carnegie Mellon 
the upset victory.
It was a nice bit of momentum 
for us, Yang said.
The Tartans needed that mo
mentum going into their match 
where they faced the number-twoseeded Washington University 
Bears, who were ranked eighth 
in the nation.
Poor weather limited the semi
final match to just singles, and 
the Tartans were swept 4-0.
It- felt like everyone played
hard but the matches just didnt 
go our way, Yang said.
Despite the loss to Washington, 
the Tartans still had a chance 
to pull off an impressive finish. 
They had already manufactured 
one upset in defeating the thirdseeded Maroons. A second upset, 
this time against the fourth-seed 
New York University Violets in a 
Sunday match, gave the team a 
third-place finish in the tourna
ment.
Behind singles wins by 
Clearfield (6-0, 6-3), Kuhn 
(7-6, 6-3), Yang (6-4, 6-1), and 
Koslosky (7-6, 7-0), the Tartans 
put themselves in position for 
a win in the third-place match. 
Yang and junior Dan Munozs 
9-7 defeat of their New York 
University opponents in the dou
bles competition proved to be 
the difference in the teams 4-3 
victory.
By taking third, the mens team 
tied for the schools highest finish 
in the conference tournament. 
The third-place finish combined 
with the quality of their oppo
nents made the tournament a 
success.
We were happy we pulled that 
out because we lost to both NYU 
and Chicago earlier this year, 
Yang said. So overall it was a 
pretty good tournament for us to 
finish third.
Although conference play 
ended with the tournaments con
clusion on Sunday, both teams 
have the postseason in mind.
The women are in the NCAA 
[tournament] for sure and the 
guys are kind of more on the 
bubble,, Girard said. Well find 
out in a week if they make it or 
not.

Tartan men take second at track and field championship
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor 
& Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens and wom
ens track and field teams competed at 
their University Athletic Association 
championship last weekend at Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland, 
Ohio.
The Tartans competed at the champi
onship against Washington University, 
the University of Chicago, New York 
University, Brandeis University, Emory 
University, and host Case. CarnegieMellons mens team finished in the 
medals, coming in second place overall, 
and the womens team finished in sixth 
place.
Placing second with 166.5 points,
Carnegie Mellons mens track and field 
team dominated the majority of its 
conference, falling only to Washington 
University, which racked up 217 points.
Junior Eric Tang took home the 
Tartans only individual first-place finish, 
winning the long jump with a jump of 
6.79 meters. He outjumped second-place 
finisher Zach Rodgers of the University 
of Chicago by 0.21 meters.
Tang also placed second in the triple 
jump (13.35 meters), followed by team
mate first-year Colin Marks, whose 
13.23-meter jump was good enough for 
a fourth-place finish.
Masters student Tom Matta finished 
second in both the shot put, with a throw 
of 1440 meters, and in the hammer 
throw, with a throw of 4944 meters.' 
Sophomore Michael Reggie joined Matta 
in the hammer throw with a fourth-place 
finish of his own (43.96 meters).
In the discus throw, Reggie finished 
second with a throw of 42.08 meters, 
while Matta finished fifth with a throw 
of 39.91 meters. The disc came to
gether very well for me, and I was able 
to PR [personal record] and take sec
ond thanks to great coaching and great 
weather, Reggie said. No one wants to 
be second best, but at least for me the 
meet showed that Ive got a chance to be 
one of the best in the UAA for the next 
two years.
In track events, the Tartan men domi
nated the relays by placing first in both 
the 4x400-meter relay and the 4x800- 
meter relay. The 4x400-meter team of 
juniors Keith Torluemke, Mark Davis, 
Russel Verbofsky, and first-year Carlton 
Reeves ran a 3:22.52 for the win. Juniors 
Geoff Misek, Davey Quinn, Torluemke, 
and first-year Brian Harvey made up the 
4x800-meter relay team, clocking in a
time of 7:48.07.
The 4xl00-meter relay team of junior 
Nick Bannister, first-year Joel Palko, 
Tang, and Verbofsky also did not disap
point, finishing second with a time of 
43.29.
The Carnegie Mellon men also had 
three second-place finishes in individual 
track events. Junior Jeff Polack finished 
second in the 400-meter hurdles with a 
time of 56.44, Verbofsky placed second 
in the 200-meter dash with a time or 
22.53, and Bannister added a second 
place finish in the 110-meter hurdles 
(14.98).
Finishing third for the Tartans were 
first-year Carlton Reeves, with a 51.51 
finish in the 400-meter dash, and senior 
Nick End in the 10,000-meter run 
(31:43.16).

Tartan golf team 
enters final weekr,t- -
by Adam Lazarus
Junior Staffwriter
By competing in back-to-back 
tournaments, last week, Carnegie 
Mellons golf team tuned up for 
next weeks crucial University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
championships, the conference 
tournament they hope will launch 
the team into its first ever Division 
III national bid.
Last Saturday and Sunday, the 
Tartans competed in the Edward 
Jones Shootout in Apollo, Pa. 
Unfortunately, the teams 611 
score was four strokes behind the 
University of Rochester, a team 
with whom the Tartans are com
peting for the final spot in the 
national tournament.
After posting a 298 on Saturday, 
the best score of the tournament, 
Carnegie Mellon fired a 313 on 
Sunday to fall to second place.
The Tartans were led by firstyear Alex Timmons and sopho
more Howard Smith, who each 
finished in the top 10 on the 
leader board.
I was hitting the ball really 
solid on the first day. And on 
the second day I wasnt hitting it 
nearly as close  I didnt hit as 
many greens  but I was able to 
make some putts and keep it to 
a decent score, said Smith, who
fired a two-day score of 152, eight 
shots over par, for a sixth-place 
finish.
The second day was a little 
frustrating because we had 
Rochester on the ropes and we 
kind of let them beat us.
Timmons followed his 74 on 
Saturday with a 75 on Sunday to 
take fourth place at the Spring 
Church Club.
I putted well; I dont think I 
had any three-putts; and I hit a 
bunch of greens, which helped 
a lot, said Timmons, who, as 
one of the Tartans longer hit
ters, benefited from the courses 
shorter distances and wide 
fairways. An eagle on hole 18 
highlighted Timmons weekend 
and gave him a 149 for the tour
nament.
Following the weekend event, 
four Tartans competed as indi
viduals the next day at the Grove 
City Invitational, where again 
Timmons and Smith posted two 
of the top scores.
Timmons, who fired an even 
par-72 for a second-place finish, 
credited his success to his mental 
approach to the round.
I was playing smart, Timmons 
said. I was just trying to minimize 
my bad shots. If I hit a bad shot I 
wouldnt just try to make birdie

by Corey Tucker .
Junior Staffwriter
Following a week of wins for 
the Tartan womens tennis 
team, Mona Iyer was named the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) womens tennis athlete of 
the week. Iyer posted a perfect 
record over the past week play
ing at second singles and first 
doubles. Her wins came against 
Mercyhurst College (Pa.), 
Washington College (Md.), 
and Johns Hopkins University.
Those three victories helped 
the Tartans to a perfect record 
against those three teams. This 
honor marks the fourth time 
already this season that Iyer has 
been named UAA athlete of the 
week. Recently the Tartan spoke 
with Iyer about her success on 
and off the court.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing tennis and why?
Iyer: I started playing when 
I was five years old. My whole 
family played so that is why I 
got into it. I just wanted to be 
like my older brother.
T: Did you always know that 
you wanted to play in college?
I: When I was younger I did, 
but as a senior in high school 
applying to colleges, I wanted 
to focus more on academics. 
So I decided to pick a school 
without talking to any coaches 
and just walk on the team at 
that school.
T: What is the hardest part 
about being a Carnegie Mellon 
student athlete? Whats the 
best?
I: The hardest part is leaving 
every weekend and getting be
hind on work. But I find that 
I am actually more organized 
while playing tennis because it
1
forces me to manage my time 
well. Being a student athlete has 
also allowed me to meet lots of 
amazing people.
T: Do you have any good luck 
charms or superstitions?
I: I always listen to my iPod and 
I will not change into my tennis 
shoes until we start warming up. 
I also have to have one bottle of 
water and one Gatorade on the 
court with me all the time.-
T: What do you do before a 
match?
I: I like to talk to my dad or my 
brother before matches because 
they can always calm me down 
if Im nervous.
T: Where is your favorite place 
to compete?
I: Anywhere with a lot of sun 
and a lot of people.
T: What is your most meaning
ful accomplishment to date?
I: Earning All-American hon
ors with my partner, Amy 
[Staloch].
T: To what do you attribute 
your success in tennis?
I: Ron Williams, my coach from 
home. He has taught me pretty 
much everything I know about 
tennis since I was five years old
and continues to be one of my 
close friends.
T: How supportive is your fam
ily?
I: Very supportive  they 
come to every match they can 
take off work for and have al
ways encouraged me to play as 
many sports as possible while 
growing up.
T: What is the best advice 
youve been given?
I: Be patient and develop the 
point. I have a tendency to just 
try to hit the ball as hard as 
I can and most of the time it 
doesnt really work out for me. 
Being patient has always been 
my biggest challenge on the ten
nis court.
T: What do you do in your free 
time at Carnegie Mellon?
I: When I have some free time 
I like to just relax and eat good 
food.
T: Do you plan to continue 
your tennis career post-collegiately?
I: I can see myself being one 
of those women who play in 
leagues whenever they have 
free time. But I dont see my
self making an appearance at 
Wimbledon at any time.

CarnEVIL?
Carnivals have become fright-inducing events in America
The Morewood parking lot has been nanowed by 
yellow CAUTION borders, fluorescent wristbands 
have replaced every band fans watch, and the 
Carnival promising to transport us to Another 
Time and Place has produced the kind of campus 
zeal typically reserved for non-dreary afternoons 
and misplaced art sculptures. With funnel cakes 
and rides that make you puke funnel cakes, 
Carnegie Mellons Carnival replica is a throwback 
to the traveling caravans of yore. All we need 
is an accordion-touting primate accompanying 
a bearded babe 
singing "Auld 
Lang Syne and 
it will be just 
the vision Ray 
Bradbury had 
when he penned 
Wamething 
Wicked This Way 
Cames.
The self-explanatory website www.saferparks. 
arg reports: "There is no longer any source of 
statistical information on injuries related to 
carnival rides. It continues, "Buyers should 
beware. In this case, what you dont know can 
hurt you. They busted out the italics and the 
boldface, so you know they mean business.
But given the barrage of media firestorms that 
accompany any carnival injury, the public 
is, if anything, too informed of the risk that 
accompanies handing your life over to a Tilt-aWhirl attendant.
Around the 
world, countries 
like Denmark 
and Brazil hold 
Carnival-esque 
festivities lively 
enough to make 
the most fabulous 
pride parade
cower in embarrassment. There are scary doll 
masks! Floats as tall as buildings! Dancing better 
than the Rockettes! So why do carnivals in 
America conjure up images of coked-out camies 
luring vulnerable youngsters to coasters bedecked 
in duct tape, ready to mangle its unknowing thrillseekers?
We can blame Final Destinatian 3 for a lot of 
things, but not this one. Sure, the edifying film of 
spring 2006 opens with a high school graduation 
trip to a carnival ending in a roller ruckus, replete 
with flying seat cars and seat harnesses in dire 
need of a recall. But how did the masterminds 
behind the Final Destinatian series know to 
capitalize on this fear as American as hot dogs or 
the proverbial apple pie?
The inconspicuously titled 1932 film Freaks 
offers the harshest glimpse into the sheltered 
world of conjoined twins, 182-year-old sages, and 
bifocal-wearing little people. The cast of reallife sideshow attractions is a moving testament 
to the truly unusual specimens haunting the 
fantasies of reluctant carnival visitors today.
The carnival  specifically, the kind put on at 
events called "community days or those that 
seem to sprout from endless rows of dried crops
 has joined the repertoire of scary entities that 
arent so frightening when logically approached, 
like the dark or Bea Arthur.
Why do carnivals in 
America conjure up images 
of coked-out carnies luring 
vulnerable youngsters to 
coasters bedecked In duct 
tape, ready to mangle its 
unknowing thrill-seekers?
A similar by
product of the 
Culture of Fear 
was the fervor 
with which 
parents across the 
country scoured 
their children's 
Halloween loot for 
pins, needles, and 
expired JuJu beans. 
Research conducted 
by author Barry 
Glassner negated 
the unwarranted 
hype, but that 
wont stop parents 
from rifling through 
Snickers-congested pillow sacks.
So Carnival can be a good time for all when 
approached with a delicate balance of caution 
and good-natured carnie fun. Just dont throw 
all your cares to the wind. Or your hair, for that 
matter.
And dont worry about a couple of camies. 
Chances are you can outrun them.
Sure, the rides look a little rickety and workers 
resemble dejected NFL running backs, but come 
on: The scariest thing about this years Carnival 
isnt the beckoning molesters, but the fact that 
the $40,000 a year we already pay wasnt enough 
to cover free-admission rides.

This year
There was much excitement this year during the 
Spring Carnival season. An unscheduled rally 
took place on Morewood Avenue, in which several 
Campus Queen candidates - upon close inspec
tion of a photograph taken by a tree-climbing Tartan 
photographer - were among the mob. Another 
interesting incident during the event was the skip
ping or bouncing of one of the raw eggs from the 
cement to the lawn without breaking, after a throw 
of something like eighty feet. The lucky gg was 
then used in the competition over and over again. It 
is unsaid what the rally was about, so it is left for us 
to wonder if it might have been for something like 
a Long Live the Winning Egg campaign that the 
unruly queen candidates got caught up in.
Phi Kap retained its status as pie-eating contest 
winner for the second year in a row. Too bad there 
is no longer a competition like that for Carnival 
these days, The frat boys could still entertainingly 
dominate that. In other news, Carlos Santana cap
tivated the Carnival audience, as he was the musi
cian that year. Santana? Seriously? What hap
pened to having big names like that at Carnival?
1990 alumna Ellen Koh talked about her least 
favorite things about Carnival: The weather. 
Definitely the weather. And the line for the fun
nel cakes. Sounds familiar. Also, Alpha Epsilon 
Pis booth collapsed this year. The five-year curse 
commences.
Adam Dodd, a sophomore in materials science, 
stated that he would always have the memory 
of AEPis booth falling." The five-year curse con
tinues...
Did you know what AEPis booth did this year? 
Wait, it did what? Yes, seriously. Alpha Epsilon Pis 
booth collapsed a year early.-
During this years Carnival, AEPi brother Dan 
Rosenthal said, "Dave Maon, my roommate, fell 
off the roof about eight feet. Mason was hard 
at work on the Aztec structure when gravity got 
hold of him. He was not injured and the booth 
still stood, because the curse jumped the gun last 
year.

APhriedOreos
Service fraternity provides new and traditional Carnival fare
Spring Carnival: a time when Carnegie Mellon students come 
out from their dorm rooms, cubicles, and computer clusters 
to temporarily halt their work and enjoy such festivities as 
munching the multitudes of gastronomical delights offered 
at the vendors and on-campus dining establishments. In 
between checking everything out on Midway, a stop at the 
Alpha Phi Omega concession stand always yields classic fair 
food choices such as hot dogs, pizza, nachos, cotton candy, 
pretzels, popcorn, coffee, hot chocolate, and soda. Those 
ready to mix up their junk food intake and can make the break 
from their reliance on the O by swinging by APhiO.
APhiO, the national co-ed service fraternity, has been 
providing those staple foods for 50 years, but their highlighted 
menu item is undoubtedly their steaming-hot funnel 
cakes sprinkled with powdered sugar. The perfectly crisp, 
sweet, golden-brown finger food is worth every cent of its 
$5 cost. Each tasty snack is created by four people and an 
ever-going industrial mixer. Even with the production line 
going constantly, keeping funnel cakes stocked for Carnival 
consumers is difficult. This year's totals are yet uncalculated, 
but last year APhiO sold 1200 funnel cakes in all.
In keeping the supply where the demand is, APhiO's menu 
offerings vary slightly from year to year and depend on the 
weeks weather forecast. "We dont want to serve what people 
don't want to eat, said Divya Jesuraj, a 2004 Carnegie Mellon 
alum. The statement proves true with the creation of their 
two latest additions. Last year, they retired the minimally 
accepted chili cheese dogs for the new delicacy of spicy 
sausages.
Occasionally, the brothers hanging out behind the concession 
stand Friday afternoon held up a cardboard sign that had on . 
it scribbled the words We want Oreos." Among the notable
inventions that have come out of Carnegie Mellon, the fried 
Oreo could be ranked near the top of the list. Added last 
year to the list of foodstuffs Alpha Phi Omega supplies at 
Carnival is this curiously delicious new wave of fried sweets. 
A group of us dubiously decided to try the $3 order of four. I 
did not quite know what to expect at first, but quickly came 
around after my initial bite. The warm, gooey, chocolatey, 
creamy wonder is enough to spur even the most staunchly 
conservative food critics into amazement. We decided that 
they may have the potential of usurping the position of the lil 
orbit (the now-outdated mini-doughnut) as one of the musthaves of fair food.
Stephen Mandzak  who was the previous concessions 
chair of APhiO and graduated last year  talked about how 
the unexpected food of obesity-creating enchantment came 
about. Mandzak said that it had been through watching one 
of his idols, Alton Brown of the show Good Eats on the Food 
Network, fry a Snickers bar. After some semi-successful 
attempts at trying that endeavor, the epiphany occurred one 
night when the fryer was on and a fellow brother walked into 
the room while eating Oreos. Mandzak immediately battered 
the cookie and plunged it into the hot grease and thence the 
magic was bom. Since then, the Oreos have been growing in 
popularity.
The entire production is set up like a well-oiled business, 
and the APhiO brothers are proud of their work. With up to 
20 people helping at a time, the sanitation is outstanding, 
the efficiency well thought-out, and the manpower is present 
to keep it all afloat. Marybeth Griffin, who graduated from 
Carnegie Mellon in 1996 and now works for the University, let 
me take a peek into the concession stand. The alums at the 
booth explained that what they do is not only a tradition for 
them, but also an opportunity for them to leam camraderie,

budget coordination, stress-management techniques, and

Alpha Phi Omega is a non-profit organization, and this is the 
one time each year in which they are able to make the money 
needed to fund their other projects throughout the year, which 
include Girl Scout SCIP day, the Magic Bus at spring break 
and Thanksgiving, and running concessions at sports games.
For those who missed out on the delicious dishes after 
Midway closed for the night, there of course was the old, 
reliable O food. Last Friday, a late-night cheese dog and bago-fries was a reasonable and satiable substitute for Carnival 
food, until even the run on their own food supplies caused 
significant shortages and the O was forced to close an hour 
early  much to the chagrin of many who were then left only 
with the option of order-in pizza. Next year they will know not 
to be stuck at the O when APhiO is serving their legendary 
Oreos.

The anatomy of Sweepstakes
Find out the hows and whats and wheres of Buggy
It doesn't happen anywhere else In the nation. It defines its own college subculture  one 
of early morning practices, late-night build sessions, and a staggering amount of djict tape. 
Its Buggy, and it's what makes Carnegie Mellon even more unique (and perhaps absurd) 
than it already is.
So what are those little cars made of? Are they directed by remote control? Is there actually 
a real person inside? Why do people do it?
Composite materials. No. Yes, theyre called drivers, and they are extraordinarily petite 
members of the Carnegie Mellon community. Because there is nothing else like it  
anywhere.
In short, Sweepstakes  Buggys official name  is a competition among independent 
student organizations, fraternities, and one sorority in which teams of mechanics race 
small, low-to-the-ground vehicles with hopes of navigating the course the fastest. To boot, 
everyone participating in Buggy in any way must be a current student of Carnegie Mellon.
While it is not easy to define Buggy, and especially challenging to explain why people do 
it, a solid start is to explain what a buggy is made of. The general parts of a buggy, which 
all teams have despite their overall level of competitiveness, are an outer shell, a steering 
system, a windshield, a pushbar, a set of wheels, and a driver.
The Buggy course. Its long, full of complex curves, and anything but simple to navigate. This 
4412-foot-long course is divided into five sections plus a sixth freeroll portion, and these different 
areas are manned by various'members of a push team. The five sections other than the freeroll 
are officially referred to as Hills 1 through 5, and are uphill or flat regions of the course in which a 
single member of the organizations push team provides the buggy with speed and power.
1. Hill 1: Hill 1 is the first leg of the course. A team's Hill 1 pusher is generally its physically 
strongest member.
2. Hill 2: The Hill 2 pusher picks up the shove from the Hill 1 pusher and pushes the buggy over 
the crest of the hill on Tech Street. The buggy begins its freeroll descent down Schenley Drive 
toward Phipps Conservatory.
3. Freeroll: The freeroll portion of the course is the only part of the race in which the driver is 
not pushed by a pusher. This 2500-foot-long portion of the course drops in elevation, allowing the 
driver to pick up speed before heading into the most technical part of the course.
4. The Chute: The Chute, also known as the Curve, is recognized as the most technically 
challenging leg of the course and is where the road curves around the bottom of Flagstaff Hill.
5. Hill 3: Hill 3 is where the third pusher picks up the buggy as it rolls out of the Chute.
6. Hill 4: Hill 4 consists of a portion of Frew Street behind Baker Hall, and is long, straight, and 
slightly steep.
7. Hill 5: Hill 5 is the longest pusher section on the course, and ends at the finish line. It is flat, 
so a Hill 5 pusher is generally a teams fastest.

A buggys shell is made of composites. These materials are extremely light, have a high 
strength-to-weight ratio, and are cutting-edge in the world of the engineering industry. 
Drivers enter the buggy through a hatch opening in the shell  located either at the front 
or on top of the buggy  or the entire shell is removed for entry. Drivers maintain visibility 
through a windshield made from polycarbonates such as Lexan, a common brand used by 
buggy mechanics across various organizations.
So how do drivers know how to maneuver these sections of the sprawling course? As any buggy 
mechanic, pusher, or driver will tell you, no two teams lines (planned paths for the course) are 
the same. Some teams instruct their drivers to traverse the course conservatively, not making 
any sudden or sharp changes in direction or attempting any risky movements. Others are more 
daring, insisting that their line be one of great movement and precise maneuvering into the 
Chute.
Buggies are built to maneuver the course in different ways, although there are several 
characteristics which are necessarily employed by all groups. Steering systems, which 
are controlled by the driver as she or he stretches her or his arms forward while lying 
stomach-down, are designed individually for each buggy, and are made to allow a driver to 
easily navigate the twists, turns, and potholes of the course. An aluminum pushbar, which 
pushers hold on to on their respective hills, extends upward from the rear of the buggy. 
(See course design description at right.) All buggies must have at least three wheels, 
which are commonly organized into either reverse or standard trike positions. The former 
features two front wheels and one in the rear, and the latter relies on one wheel in front of 
the drivers face and two balancing the buggy in back.
Finally, the human touch: the driver. While all teams look for different qualities in their 
drivers, such as overall size, driving ability, or dedication to the idea of Buggy as a whole, 
it is agreed that without drivers, Buggy would not exist. The intricacies of the mechanics 
and the strategies developed by the pushers are only applicable when the driver is 
strapped inside the buggy  helmet, goggles, and all.
Is there a difference? As the discrepancy between highly successful and less successful teams 
is often great, there must be. The varying organizations can agree, however, on one thing: To 
successfully maneuver the Buggy course, the only one in the world, it takes a great driver, a 
motivated push team, and a highly innovative team of mechanics. Year after year, that seems to 
be the recipe for success.

Buggy: Life on the edge
The method to Fringes Buggy madness: A glimpse behind the scenes
The most common question any Fringe member gets asked 
has to be: "What does Fringe do? The answer is simple:
Since 1969, Fringe has been doing whatever it wants. They 
sell concessions at the McConomy movies; they have waterballoon fights; they throw parties; they build a booth every 
year; and theyre always at the activities fair. But what Fringe 
does most seriously is Buggy, and their buggies are some 
of the fastest and best-looking Carnegie MeEon has to offer. 
Fringe buggies have taken first place in the annual design 
competition for seven years in a row and have earned the 
organization a considerable collection of top-five and firstplace finishes.
Though race day is, of course, the climax of the Buggy season, 
it only happens because 35 pushers, 25 mechanics, and four 
tiny drivers bum the midnight oil all year. To the untrained 
observer, it may seem like Buggy just happens. A bunch of 
guys hunt around at the beginning of the year for curiously 
tiny women, and in April, they shove them into composite 
canisters and send them barreling down hills. And while 
that's all true, a closer look into Fringe buggy shows that the 
journey from September to April is in fact a long, tedious, 
exciting, and sometimes very rainy experience.
You get to hassle everyone to wake up.
Buggy happens often and early. On the weekends, practices 
start around 5 and go to about 9  in the morning. Though 
the early alarm ring makes most of Fringe grimace, at least 
one person is smiling. When youre in control, you get to 
hassle everyone to wake up, said Fringe Buggy chairman and 
senior mechanical engineering major Dave Bertucci. Fringe 
also practices on weekdays from midnight to 2 am, rain or 
shine. Well, never shine  because its midnight  but 
sometimes rain.
So whats with the buggy names: Brazen, Blackjack, Blizzard, 
Bantam? Fringe looks for good two-syllable names that start 
with the letter B  its tradition. "We just throw names in a 
pot and talk about a cool name, said Fringe head mechanic 
and junior mechanical engineering major John Thornton.
It has a rear-wheel fairing!
Mechanics are an odd group, always whispering to another, 
rummaging through tools, walking the course, staring 
critically at this or that. Fringe mechanics are involved 
with making buggies from their first few days with the 
organization. "Right when I joined, they gave me a project. 
They trusted me, said first-year electrical and computer 
engineering major Mark Ritterhof. It makes sense that Fringe 
works their mechanics so hard when you figure that they 
build a new buggy each year.
Fringe takes pride in everything that they do. From the first 
conception to the final product, the whole team contributes to 
each new buggy. We dont contract out parts of our buggies. 
We build it all ourselves," said Bertucci. Designing a buggy is 
a year-long experience, but the plans go down on paper in the
span of a week at the end of fall semester. Two months after 
that, a buggy is bom.
Mechanics take care of things that even people who 
are heavily involved with Buggy would take for granted. 
Windshields, pushbars, hatches  Fringe takes every piece 
into account when building a new buggy. According to one 
mechanic, Fringe's newest buggy, Bantam, has all the bells 
and whistles. Bertucci said, "It even has a rear-wheel fairing!
But Fringe mechanics arent a pack of do-gooders either. Just 
like every other Buggy organization, they have their share of 
secrets  something about compounds and glues and exotic 
materials and whatnot. They want to win as much as the 
next guy, and theyre not afraid to do what it takes to win. 
This is Buggy, not ethics," mechanic and first-year computer 
science major Andrew Hundt said. Though mechanics from 
opposing teams smile and nod to each other, there are enough 
rumors and accusations thrown back and forth to make 
Regina George blush. And why shouldnt they take Buggy so 
seriously? According to Thornton, Buggy is more work than all 
of his classes combined.
Thornton, who will ultimately be responsible for choosing 
the next head mechanic, said, If you work long enough, you 
think This guys on the ball. He can take the organization to 
the next step."
The inside of the buggy is gross."
She was short. That's most of it. We basically try to find cool, 
short people, said Thornton about first-year driver Jessica 
Thurston. At 5 IV2", Thurston is Fringes tallest driver by 
far. The other three drivers all measure in at under five feet. 
And you had better believe that drivers know their height (or 
lack thereof) puts them in great demand. "Drivers know their 
coveted position. I don't think Thurston has put on her own 
helmet all year, Bertucci said.
How do you become a driver? They asked me my number 
and if I was free for dinner," explained first-year driver Janice 
Weinberg. For two weeks I was friends with them until they 
told me I had to wake up at 5 am. Actually they didnt even 
tell me. Torrie, an older driver, told me."
My shirt is freaking soaked. The inside of the buggy is 
gross," said head driver Lindsey Bernier, a sophomore 
materials engineering major, after one very rough and very 
wet run of the course. Bernier drives Fringes latest buggy, 
Bantam. Despite occasional discomfort, Bemier actually loves 
the thrill of the race. I get a rush from being in the buggy, 
she said. I like things like rollercoasters and thrill rides and 
stuff and being in the buggy is kind of similar. The first few 
times I went down it was a little scary, but once you get the 
hang of it, its like a thrill ride.
Statements like these from drivers make mechanics mouths 
water. Thornton admits he is jealous of the tiny women who 
get to drive his buggies. This summer, Thornton and the other
mechanics are thinking about making a man-size buggy and 
driving their creations for the very first time. Maybe they can 
even get the drivers to push them.
It isnt all fun and games and thrill rides for Bemier, however. 
She has been under a lot of pressure all year to score Fringe a 
winning time on race day. "There are definitely expectations 
for how fast the buggy is going to be," Bemier said. I want 
the buggy to have an awesome roll on race day, which is on 
me. I am definitely nervous since all the alumni will be there 
and all the mechanics hard work all year comes down to just 
one or two rolls.
The drivers keep the mechanics on their toes and make sure 
that they are doing their jobs," said Bemier on communication 
between drivers and the rest of team. Its our safety on the 
line. If we hear something while were in the buggy that 
doesnt sound right, we let them know."
We all have a lot of team pride and are very close. The drivers 
have a lot of spirit and try to keep everyone positive and 
motivated."
We can take a little rain."
Insignificant happenings like thunderstorms dont keep 
Fringe off the course. Two weeks before race day, with only 
a handful of practices left, Fringe decided to brave Mother 
Nature and push their buggies despite the rain. In the 
thunder and lightning and pouring rain, only Fringe came out 
to practice. According to Thornton, The more practice we 
get the better we'll be. The buggies can take a little rain. We 
can take a little rain. Its worth it."
But he does have to push it, which is an art all to itself. While 
the mechanics are fidgeting, taping, checking harnesses, and 
fixing helmets, the pushers are doing their ritual warm-up 
dances. Theres a little prancing around, stretching, hopping 
up and down, and running up and down the sidewalk.
Pushers are a mixed group pulled from all over campus. Some 
are pulled from the track team, some are mechanics, others 
are friends or friends of friends. For pushers, Buggy is lot of 
waiting and a little bit of very intense action.
"Havent you ever been to a track meet?" asked first-year 
pusher and economics major Dan Aduna. That seems to sum 
it up pretty well.
First-year pusher and design major Grant Cobb didnt seem to 
mind the rain. After pushing Blizzard through a mild storm, he 
scored his best time on the final straightaway of the course. 
Apparently, it decreases the friction.
Even for pushers, who will never see the inside of the buggies 
and could probably care less how they are made, Buggy is 
a secretive enterprise. When Cobb went to speak with his 
friend from another team during one practice, the girl he was 
speaking with was accused only half-jokingly of "fraternizing

You have to understand the Buggy culture."
Buggy is weird  cramming into a tube at 4 am, protecting 
secrets more valuable than gold, dedicating your entire 
morning (or night, depending on how you look at it) to 
pushing a buggy 50 feet a single time. But as Thornton said, 
"You have to understand the Buggy culture. And what 
exactly is this Buggy culture? Its waking up early, staying up 
all night instead of going to parties  all the weird things you 
never think youre going to do."
"You have to love it for what it is. Its just a weird thing that 
you can only do in one place in the world.
Buggy is something that riles people up at a school where it 
is almost impossible to pry people out of their calculus books. 
It brings out more people and pride than any sports team at 
Carnegie Mellon. And why? Probably because it's really weird. 
Just like us.

Brooms and umbrellas mark this years Buggy competition
PiKA sweeps Buggy in one day of competition, as rain cancels second round
In addition to the usual sights on race day  Pi Kappa 
Alphas (PiKA) signature 1920s fire truck and onlookers with 
their cups of coffee  brooms and umbrellas marked this 
year's Sweepstakes competition.
On Saturday morning, a Buggy-hungry audience braved 
Mother Nature, hoping for the second and final day of races 
through Schenley Park. However, continuous rain through 
Friday night rendered the course unsafe and postponed the 
race until 9:30 am. When it began to drizzle at 9 am, Buggy 
safety chairman Adam McCue canceled the days races. For 
the first time since 2002, Fridays preliminary results were 
taken as the official final results.
The rain may have stopped the finals, but it didn't stop Buggy 
participants from crowding into the main tent on Midway on 
Saturday afternoon to hear the winners announced. Teams 
held drivers, trophies, and  in PiKAs case  brooms in the 
air to celebrate their victories.
But why brooms?
In Fridays preliminary races, PiKA "swept" the competition, 
with winning times for the mens A and B teams and the 
winning time for women. Not only did they enjoy victory, they 
also boasted the fastest men's B team time in Buggy history: 
2:09.79. As a result, PiKAs B team placed second just behind
their first-place A team at 2:07.30. The win marks PiKAs fifth 
consecutive victory in the mens division.
I want to thank our B team for providing such stiff 
competition this year, said PiKA brother and Buggy chair 
Matt Long as he collected a team award at Saturdays 
ceremony.
Coming in behind the two PiKA teams were the mens Ateam buggies from Student Dormitory Council (SDC) in third 
at 2:09.94, Fringe in fourth at 2:10.59, and Sigma Nu (Sig Nu) 
rounding out the top five at 2:15.80.
In the mens division, three teams times were disqualified, 
and three didn't finish. Fringe B was disqualified because of 
rank  its C team had a faster time than its B team, which is 
a violation of Sweepstakes rules. Sigma Phi Epsilon (Sig Ep)
A was disqualified because a piece of its buggy fell off during 
its heat, and the Beta Theta Pi (Beta) B team was disqualified 
due to roster violation: In the mens fourth heat, Beta B nearly 
spun out in the Chute. As Spirit A slowed down to pass, the 
two buggies nearly collided, and a non-team member stepped 
in to push the Beta buggy to prevent it from crashing.
Spirit B, Kappa Kappa Gamma (Kappa) A, and SDC C did not 
finish their heats.
In the womens division, PiKA continued to dominate, as its 
A- team took the first-place victory with a time of 2:38.50. 
Rolling in behind them was SDC A in second with a time of 
2:41.10, Spirit A in third at 2:41.75, Fringe A in fourth with 
2:42.19, and Sig Nu A in fifth with a time of 2:42.30.
Two teams were disqualified in the women's division: Spirit 
B because of a missed transition between hills, and Sig Ep A, 
which also lost part of its buggy during the heat.
The team from Kappa A was the only womens team that 
didn't finish, after they spun out in the Chute. Even though 
they may not have crossed the finish line, Kappa bridged a 
gender gap in Buggy tradition. Whereas fraternity brothers 
typically push the campus's tiniest girls, the only sorority to 
participate in Buggy squeezed a boy into their game plan
 they pushed driver Peter Lynch, an 83-pound first-year.
Come Saturday, Buggy participants had more to celebrate 
than race times: Spirit took home the award for best T-shirt for 
their bright yellow design, the Carnegie Involvement 
Association won the team award for spirit, Fringe garnered 
the Peoples Choice Award for their buggy Bantam, and Beta 
was named the Chairmans Choice.
In the design competition, Fringe continued to keep the 
competition in check. Its buggy Bantam placed first  a

But it was PiKA who cleaned up the awards with their sweep 
on race day. As their winning teams went to collect their 
trophies on stage, some brothers whipped out their brooms - 
and swept the stage in front of their victorious teammates.

Purple powder people
OM takes over Flagstaff Hill in celebration of Holi
What can be bad about an event where 
paint-throwing is encouraged? Welcome 
to Holi, the Hindu festival of colors. It 
falls annually on one of the full moons in 
late spring and has, for the past couple 
of years, occurred over spring break. 
However, Carnegie Mellon students, 
being the paint-loving kids that we are, 
celebrate Holi with a massive color war on 
Flagstaff Hill every spring during Carnival 
weekend.
Due to Hinduisms evolution as 
an intricate web of mythology and 
philosophy, there are probably many 
stories that led to the creation of Holi, 
none of them really having anything to do 
with color wars.
The most famous story is that of 
Hiranyakashipu, king of the demons, who 
became far too powerful and could only 
be defeated by Narasimha, the fourth 
avatar of Vishnu. Actually, kings who 
accrue far too much power is~a theme 
Hinduism is especially fond of, especially 
kings that must be defeated by avatars 
of Vishnu, but I digress. Hiranyakashipu 
had a son named Prahalad  who was 
a devotee of Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu
 who had a severe god complex, by the 
way  didnt like that, so he tried to kill 
Prahalad repeatedly. As the story goes, 
Prahalad called on Vishnu, who appeared
in the form of Narasimha, a half-lion, 
half-man, and killed Hiranyakashipu. And 
they all lived happily ever after. Except 
for Hiranyakashipu  who died. Isn't 
Hinduism fun?
So youre probably still wondering how 
throwing colored powder become a part 
of Holi. Chances are nobody really knows. 
There are stories of Krishna, the eighth 
avatar of Vishnu (there are 10), having 
color wars with his friends when he was 
a child. So this tradition, like every other 
Hindu custom, dates back quite a ways.
Carnegie Mellons Holi event is put on by 
OM, the Hindu/Jain/Sikh organization 
on campus. According to first-year 
representative Akshat Gupta, OM has 
been sponsoring this event for seven 
years, and over 200 people show up every 
year for the paint-flinging frenzy.
This years event got off to a slow start 
due to the delayed arrival of the caterers. 
In addition to that minor fiasco, there 
was the misprinting of the Holi T-shirts, 
on which the text was printed upside 
down, showing "WO" instead of OM. 
Despite these setbacks and the rain, 
many people showed up, ready to hurl 
colored dye at one another. When asked 
if rain would hinder the color war, the 
more experienced warriors just replied,
"It just makes the powder stick better." 
Interestingly enough, in India, the powder 
is often mixed with water in large basins 
and dumped on innocent or not-soinnocent passer-by.
So if you managed to catch a glimpse of 
lunatics scampering around Flagstaff, 
dyed red, blue, and green from head to 
toe, you witnessed the mania that is Holi. 
You werent just tripping.

Did you know that the CIA changed

a New York Times article: The 
agency ... changed the ending 
of the movie version of '1984, 
disregarding Orwells specific 
instructions that the story not 
be altered. I just wanted to let 
you know that before you see it, 
because nowhere is this mentioned 
in the movie. This movie does riot 
do the book justice. If you have not 
read the book, do that instead. If 
you have read the book and have 
recovered from Carnival, go see the 
movie. The story is still there.

This is a badass cop movie from 
1968 with Steve McQueen as 
Lieutenant Bullitt. It cant really be 
classified as an action movie, but 
it has one of the most memorable 
and parodied car chases in film 
history. If you can stand slow but 
well-done 60s .movies, this is 
definitely one of the best.

This is that movie you wanted 
to see about Pierce Brosnan the 
hitman, but you just couldnt find 
the time to make it to the theater, 
what with winter break and all.
Now is your chance. This has been 
called Brosnans best performance 
of his career, where he plays a 
character so much wittier and more 
real than James Bond. Paired with 
Greg Kinnear and cool backdrops, 
Brosnan makes this comedy/drama 
well worth the watch.

Usually, remakes are pretty bad. 
Especially remakes of highly 
acclaimed movies. Take Burtons 
Planet of the Apes, for instance. 
Thankfully, Peter Jackson didnt 
learn from others mistakes and  
remade another movie about big 
monkeys, King Kong. I must admit, 
I was worried about this movie 
before I went to see it, and I was 
also worried about the health of my 
bladder. This is a very long, very 
expensive, and very epic movie. 
And its very good if you can sit 
through it.

AB probably thought they were 
clever beginning and ending the 
week with movies with four-digit 
numbers for titles, and when you 
compute ((2046+1984)/(2046- 
1984))-(2046-1984), it equals 3, 
which is the number of movies 
that were shown between the two. 
Ive got you figured out, AB, just 
like you figured out that 2046 is a 
good movie. Its very strange, has 
lots of sex, and has an awkward 
resolution. Sounds perfect for 
college students.

Carnegie Mellon: easy to laugh at
Pablo Francisco focuses on some campus stereotypes to garner laughs
So did you see that funny guy at the non-alcoholic fail? It 
was great, man; like we all did a "round of waters" and then 
went. With jokes like this, Pablo Francisco had everyone on 
Midway laughing for a good hour on Thursday night.
Francisco developed an intense interest in comedy at age 13. 
With the aid of a VCR his dad bought him, he started taping 
every comedy set possible; his favorites were Johnny Carson 
and David Letterman. His career began at age 17 when he 
and a friend formed a duo called the "Blowout Boys," snuck 
into a local steakhouse comedy competition, and won. Fifteen 
or so years later, he came to Carnegie Mellons Spring Carnival 
(a very accomplished comedian by this time) and shared his 
talent with an audience of Carnegie Mellon students and 
Pittsburgh locals.
Opening comedian Jasper Redd, from Comedy Central, helped 
get the crowd going with his jokes about fast-food joints and 
astute observations about how societys obsessions with 
being thin has even created a flat-screen TV.
Then Francisco and his endless impersonations stole the 
stage. He kicked off his act with a few cracks about Carnegie 
Mellon and Pittsburgh. He asked the audience, You guys 
wanna go to the petting zoo? Yeah, they got a petting zoo
 its all girls from MIT."
His impression of getting directions in downtown Pittsburgh 
also went over quite well: When you get directions it's 
like Just go that way (gunshots), and if you see a guy who 
asks Hey, you got a quarter? youve gone too far (more 
gunshots)."
In an interview with the Appleton, Wis., Post Crescent, he 
said, "Its a universal act, basically; Im talking about family, 
my girlfriend, relationships." He doesnt just talk about these 
things; he is able to tie all of them together. The theme of 
the show seemed to be cock-blocking  every skit either 
started or ended with some line about the notorious sexual 
interference. He started talking about the typical annoying 
college roommate who never lets you get any, and listed off 
some hilariously extreme scenarios such as the roommate 
who plays songs like "lollipop, lollipop... to block out the 
noise." He then went into Mexican music and black music 
and how black people never cock-block.
Franciscos act was full of energy, especially in his Jackie 
Chan skits. When he made a few jokes about Indian people, 
and how they own every business in America, a group of 
Indian students cheered him on. Pablo Francisco knows 
how to work a crowd. He even gave some valuable advice 
to college girls: If you wanna turn on a guy, get an Xbox 
tattoo.... Three to four guys can play.
He ended the show with his famous Arnold Schwarzenegger 
tortilla impression, leaving much of the crowd in hysterics.
Where has he been before?
Francisco was nominated for 1998s Funniest Male Stand-Up 
Comic award at the American Comedy Awards. He has been

Everythings okay, everythings fine
AB Concerts brings Big City Rock, Phantom Planet, and The Secret Machines to Carnival
The years hottest groups were playing on campus Friday 
night to a packed house of enthusiastic Carnegie Mellon 
students and local music buffs. The Secret Machines, 
Phantom Planet, and Big City Rock were tapped for this years 
AB Spring Carnival concert. Although the lineup probably 
made a high school music buffs dreams a reality (and indeed 
there were plenty of high school students at the show), it 
was received with mixed feelings on campus. Despite the 
somewhat controversial lineup and a venue switch due 
to weather that forced the concert indoors to Wiegand 
Gymnasium, the three bands showed up in Pittsburgh with 
plenty of energy and enthusiasm.
Big City Rock, the nights opening act, is an up-and-coming 
pop-punk group currently based in Los Angeles. Bassist 
Timothy Resudek, keyboardist Frank Staniszewski, and lead 
singer/guitarist Nate Bott started off in Madison, Wis., with 
a balanced formula of catchy, uplifting rock songs that could 
find a spot in the hearts of audiences all over the world.
The name says it all. Big City Rock can be anything," said 
frontman Bott in an interview backstage before the show 
Friday night. Big City Rocks music gives you the chance to 
"celebrate your life. While some groups shove their material 
down the throat of their audiences, Big City Rock has no 
such intent: People can get what they want out of the 
music, because the songs say enough," Bott said. A lot of the 
songs are, for that matter, epic and uplifting." The resulting 
product is appealing to some  three-minute rock songs 
that, although overproduced, are catchy, energetic, and, yeah, 
pretty uplifting. Human, according to Bott, is the heart of 
the groups self-titled record, its first on a major label. Its this 
unique, catchy, yet chorus-less song," Bott said.
Although being unique is important to the groups sound, 
moments of generic musicianship play a role in the music, 
and particularly in the group's performances. The audience 
was sure to have seen many of Big City Rocks gags, whether 
it was raising of index fingers or clapping along, done by 
many other bands before. In "All of The Above, Friday nights 
closing number, Bott asks the not-so-engaging question, "Do 
you want to rock?/Do you want to roll?/Do you want to get 
down on the floor?/All of the above/im falling in love!
Although Big City Rock's concert Friday wasn't quite as 
unique as the group may have hoped it had been, the music 
can definitely fill a certain spot in the hearts of some fans: 
With catchy songs and an energetic live show, the group has 
potential to reel in fans looking for a good time... after all, 
having fun is what it's all about in Madison, isnt it?
Next on the bill Friday night was Phantom Planet. If you 
havent thought of the OC theme song yet, you've probably 
been living under a rock for quite some time  or have 
just been a Carnegie Mellon student for three or four years. 
Phantom Planet's California has made it to television sets 
and radios all over country and has propelled the group to
superstardom in the past few years.
Although that song sometimes gets irritating, the group has 
much more to offer than their supposed sole hit. If you look 
at the groups influences, its no surprise their music is fun 
for many to listen to. We take a lot from [New Orleans funk 
group] The Meters and The Talking Heads, said guitarist 
Darren Robinson in an interview backstage on Friday night.
By staying close friends and keeping their ego in check, 
Phantom Planets music has always been about letting 
"music be music, playing what we [the group] think should 
exist. Like Big City Rock, Phantom Planets music doesnt 
do much more than make you smile. But after all the overintellectualizing and overanalyzing of music, it's something 
easier said than done.
Good music keeps you feeling good, said bassist Sam Farrar.
It keeps your attention, Robinson said.
It activates part of the brain that can't be activated 
otherwise, said lead singer Alex Greenwald.
"Good music is scary!" said drummer Jeff Conrad.
Phantom Planets concert Friday night was, well, some of 
the above. The group did keep the audiences attention by 
playing catchy fan favorites like "Lonely Day," a Beatlesinspired rock tune that harkened back to She Came in 
Through the Bathroom Window." The high school girls in the 
audience were undoubtedly singing along. However, there 
was a depressingly high amount of filler and time allotted 
for audience participation. With a half-capacity crowd at 
the concert, attempts spent at audience participation were 
doomed for failure. On the other hand, heavier rock tunes like 
Big Brat" and First Things First kept the audience on its 
toes.
In addition to California (featuring Big City Rocks Frank 
Staniszewski on a Fender Rhodes electric piano), which sent 
the miniscule crowd into a sort-of uproar, the show had one 
other pleasing moment: a pop-punk rendition of Phantom of 
the Opera. Although it wasnt scary good, it activated the 
noggins (in Greenwalds words) of the crowd.
If the crowd was disappointingly small for Phantom Planet, it 
was simply pathetic for headlining act The Secret'Machines. 
Hailing from New York City, The Secret Machines music is 
innovative and progressive. Where Phantom Planets songs 
rarely clear four minutes, The Secret Machines songs are 
rarely under five. We dont talk too much, said drummer 
Josh Garza in an interview backstage before his performance 
on Friday night. We just jam over melodies and chords and 
let the songs dictate to us what to do." The groups music 
and live show is undoubtedly an extension of this discipline
 long songs and jams that stem from basic musical ideas. To 
some, their music is engaging, exploratory, and according to
Garza, emotional. However, the performance on Friday came 
across as monotonous all too often. Opening with Alone, 
Jealous, and Stoned," the first song of the groups upcoming 
album, Ten Silver Drops, the group made it clear that they 
were far from any of the other groups emerging from New 
Yorks thriving music scene (The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, et 
al). With pulsing strobe lights and ethereal textures provided 
by guitar effects pedals, the music was definitely challenging 
to the ear.
"It reminded me of [U2 guitarist] The Edges playing, said 
first-year business major Derrick Yu. Although the groups 
style was initially engaging, execution of the music was not. 
Songs were often far longer than they needed to be, with 
styles and volumes unchanging throughout the entire course 
of the song. It was interesting at first, but after a while it was 
the same drum beat and same sound for every song," Yu said.
By the end of the show, only about 200 people remained in the 
gym. It was a show with enormous potential and enormous 
hype that simply failed to keep the audience interested. With 
more thought put into the style of each group playing (and a 
little help from the weather), maybe next years spring concert 
will make a bigger splash on campus.

seductive scene with Connor 
O'Malley, who plays the 
detective hired to find her.

S n S takes audiences to a City of Angels
The final show of the year proves to be an ambitious one
"Only the floor kept her legs from going on forever."
Maybe you should try using something like that at your next 
party  it worked as one of the fabulously over-the-top oneliners from Scotch n Sodas performance of City of Angels, 
after all. Throughout the show, 1940s private eye Stone utters 
such conversational gems in seemingly endless amounts, 
and they're probably the only thing keeping him sane. Stone, 
played by senior mechanical engineer Connor OMalley, has 
a lot on his plate. Throughout the story, hes busy locating an 
MIA stepdaughter, refuting a murder accusation, and fending 
off some femmes fatales, among other things.
Sound like a crazy plot? Thats only half of it. Turns out Stone 
is merely the literary invention of Stine, a novelist-turnedscreenwriter who finds himself more than a little in over his 
head in Hollywood. City of Angels bounces between Stones 
misadventures in sleuthery and Stines real-life drama. Stine, 
played by senior piano and German major Sam McUmber, is 
struggling to please his wife, his producer, and himself as he 
adapts his crime novel to fit the silver screen.
The story begins with a scene in Stone's office. Enter the 
charming and mysterious Alauia Kingsley (senior Alex 
Aspiazu, an ethics, history, and public policy major). Almost 
immediately, we find out theres something not quite right 
about her. Stone points out that he can tell from her tan line 
that shes usually in the habit of wearing a wedding ring. 
Guilty as suspected, Alaura removes a ring from her handbag 
and reluctantly places it back on her finger.
Despite the duplicity, Stone is persuaded to take Mrs. 
Kingsley's case when she offers him $100 upfront to find 
the missing Mallory. Mrs. Kingsley leaves Stone with a 
photograph of Mallory as his only guide. Intrigue ensues.
The second strike against Alaura Kingsley comes in the 
form of, well, a strike. Two classic thugs arrive at Stones 
place to literally knock some sense into him. They attempt 
to convince Stone to drop the case, but their success in'the 
matter is rather irrelevant, as a few nights later Stone enters 
his apartment to find Mallory Kingsley lying scantily clad on 
his bed.
Its every Carnegie Mellon students dream: a beautiful girl 
materializing atop your sheets. For Stone, however, the visit 
quickly turns sour. Mallory (Julia Brown, a sophomore English 
major) arranges herself so that she and Stone are in a rather 
compromising position, and just then her brother Peter 
(played by Dan Tasse, a sophomore computer science major) 
dashes through the scene, with enough dexterity to take a 
photograph.
See, Alauras husband Luther (Alex DiClaudio, a first-year 
economics major) is an unfortunate sufferer of infantile 
paralysis. Hes also 75 and extremely wealthy. The Kingsleys 
are trying to frame Stone for the murder of his therapist,
Dr. Mandril (Tyson Schrader, a senior English and creative 
writing major). On top of that, Mrs. Kingsley aims to poison 
her husband and swindle her stepchildren out of their shares 
of the inheritance. Stone learns of Alauras involvement in a 
similar scam involving a.similarly old and rich husband from 
her earlier life in West Virginia. In the end, Stone is able to 
prevent Mrs. Kingsley from executing her wretched plans, but 
it costs him his life.
Thats an abbreviated version of Stones half of City of Angels. 
Clearly, this isnt so much a whodunit as it is a what-the-hellis-going-on. Meanwhile, Stines world is no picnic, either.
Hes faced with the age-old Hollywood dilemma of how to
maintain your integrity and still "make it." His wife Gabbi 
(played by Rachel Gross, a senior in business administration) 
loves him so much that it disgusts her to watch him sell 
out to the industry. On the other hand, his producer Buddy 
Fidler (senior Brian Gray, an information systems major) is 
the epitome of everything loathesome about Hollywood. He 
demands constant rewrites, insisting that Stine cut out the 
element of racism in the script and change the ending so that 
Peter doesnt kill Mallory.
Eventually, enough is.enough. The border between the reel 
and the real, which was blurry to begin with, is obliterated 
as Stone confronts his creator on the subject of his waning 
scruples. Unmistakably each others alter egos, Stone and 
Stine have a very complicated relationship. At the close of 
the first act, they sing the bitter "Youre Nothing Without 
Me, which captures the paradox of a writer at odds with his 
fiction. Stine recites the clever quip "I tell you youre out of 
my mind, to which Stone later replies, Hey, Im a famous 
shamus/And most people dont know your name. At the 
songs end, Stine takes some writerly revenge, changing 
a scene so that Stone gets beat up again, this time by the 
character of Munoz (Caulder Temple, a first-year creative 
writing major).
But all is not lost: The tune of Youre Nothing Without Me is 
revived in the final scene as a reworded Im Nothing Without 
You." With Stone by his side in an imaginary friend sort of 
way, Stine storms the set where his screenplay is being filmed 
and tells Buddy Fidler its over. Nobody was more surprised 
than me when such a crazy show fell into the Hollywood 
clich of a happy ending. But its all good; after all that, Stone 
and Stine deserved a healthy dose of closure.
One of the reasons its important to have an appreciation for 
the complexity of the plot of City of Angels is that it explains

what a huge undertaking it was for the Scotch 'n' Soda Theatre 
to perform it. "Theres been a lot of work put into this show," 
said president Courtney Kochuba, a junior creative writing 
major. And she wasnt exaggerating; City of Angels required a 
massive effort, both theatrically and technically.
After The Laiamie Project, it was nice to see Scotch 'n'
Soda performing in a bigger space, and it was also entirely 
necessary. The stage, located in Rangos, was justifiably 
extensive. In the back were all the characters involved in 
the Stone saga. Then, off to the side was a desk where Stine 
sometimes sat to type a scene as it was happening. On the 
other side stood the Angel City Four (first-year design majo? 
Andrea Barber, first-year economics major Alex DiClaudio, 
first-year mechanical engineer Erica Dorfman, and junior 
English major Danielle Griswold), who sang several tunes 
throughout the show. And in the front there was a separate 
stage area where the real-life half of the story unfolded. 
Somewhere in the midst of all of that was the pit, whose 
players did an excellent job of providing 1940s-style jazz, much 
to the benefit of the atmosphere.
As for the cast, by now they must be exhausted. Everybody 
doubles, said Kochuba. And nearly all of them did; the script 
has seven mirroring roles. Many of the leads were taken by 
seniors, for whom City of Angels was the final Scotch n Soda 
performance. If they meant to go out on top, they did. Rachel 
Gross was fantastic as Gabbi (Stines wife) and Bobbi (Stones 
girl). In particular, she did an excellent job with the song It 
Needs Work, in which Gabbi is resentfully criticizing a letter 
from her husband as if it is a work-of fiction. Probably the 
funniest of the performers, Brian Gray was able to provide an 
ideal portrayal of an immoral Hollywood director. Alex Aspiazu 
was a terrific Alaura Kingsley, especially during her duet with
Connor OMalley acting as Stone for "Double Talk. The song 
was littered with tennis metaphors, Aspiazu was dressed 
in white, and the only things that seemed out of place were 
her characters shoes (improper court attire). For that matter, 
OMalleys capacity to pull off all of Stones outrageously 
cheesy one-liners is something to be admired. And it was 
easy to sympathize with the character of Stine, beautifully 
played by McUmber. His song Funny, when he realizes that 
a screenwriter's life is not for him, was very impressive. Senior 
English major Kaitlin Genovese was both Donna (Buddys 
assistant) and Oolie (Stone's assistant), and she sang You Can 
Always Count On Me as each of them, both times masterfully. 
Even with all the great senior performances, the 
underclassman portion of the cast was certainly able to hold its 
own. Also playing a double role, Caulder Temple was both the 
hilarious cop Munoz and the actor Pancho. Temple managed 
Munozs Latino accent perfectly (even in song); it was comical 
but not distastefully so. Brown also deserves praise for coolly 
singing Lost and Found in little more than her underwear.
Though the talent was undeniable, City of Angels was an 
extremely ambitious production and thus not without its 
imperfections. The most disagreeable part of the show was its 
length. Over two and half hours is a lot to ask, especially during 
Carnival weekend. The plot was intricate, but there were many 
minor scenes that could have been cut. The stage transitions . 
were often tedious, also taking up excessive amounts of time.
This year, Scotch n Soda was, undeniably, a valuable part 
of Carnival. According to Kochuba, the selection of City of 
Angels had nothing to do with the theme of Another Time 
and Place. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a perfect fit. As 
the actors moved about the various realms of the stage, taking 
the audience from the real to the imaginary, it was clear that
last weekend Midway wasn't the only place to find yourself 
transported. Traveling via booth is all well and good, but amid 
the chaos of Carnival, it was nice to sit back and let the cast of 
Scotch n Soda do most of the work.

Young teams dominate this years Mobot
First-years take home the undergrad prize and young girls receive judges choice in Mobot 2006
Wheels, or sometimes feet, propel them; skirts of trash bags 
hang from their sides. They move of their own accord, making 
the hours of work that go into their production worthwhile
 or tragically wasted. They are mobots (mobile robots), 
and every year crowds come to watch new robotic vehicles 
cooked up by the students and affiliates of Carnegie Mellon.
This year, the entries were sparse. Ben Brown, a member of 
the robotics faculty and the Mobot Committee, noted that in 
past years there had been as many as 20 entrants. Among 
the undergraduate, open, and exhibition classes, there were 
only 10 entrants, and of these, three teams never showed.
The undergraduate class awards cash prizes for first, second, 
and third place. The open class is for members of the campus 
community who are not undergraduates, and it awards a 
single prize for best run. The exhibition class is simply for 
those who wish to show off their mobots, and not to compete; 
therefore, there is no money involved in the exhibition class.
The Course
The Mobot course along the sidewalk in front of Wean Hall 
is a treacherous thing, like a tight turn on a slick road. The 
mobots must be programmed at their most basic level to 
recognize a line. However, the cracks in the sidewalk and 
the slight differences in the sidewalk color make this a more 
challenging task.
In addition, the mobots must deal with two hills: one just 
after Gate 1 and one just after Gate 8. The second hill is much 
steeper, but both hills are difficult challenges because mobots 
can easily lose control, flip over, or lose sight of the line.
There is a decision portion of the course where mobots must 
decide whether to turn or not, based on the positions of the 
gates. At this point, the course changes yearly; sometimes 
the first decision will be to go left and sometimes to go 
straight. Teams must be prepared to change their robot's 
program to fit the way the course is laid out in any given year.
On account of these multiple challenges, most teams do not 
make it to the decision points of the course, or, if they do, they 
do not have an effective solution for these points.
Undergraduate Class
The big winner in the undergraduate class was Pajamas, 
which resembled a remote-control vehicle with its guts 
exposed. Its run was impressive  it gave the audience a 
scare as it stopped on the cracks for a moment but was then 
propelled forward with a jolt. Joey Gannon, a co-creator of 
Pajamas, got harassed a little for following the car with a 
video recorder  some onlookers thought he was operating 
the mobot via remote control. Pajamas skillfully dealt with 
the hills by continuously jerking its front wheels slightly right 
and left to create resistance and make it slow its pace. Its 
major bout of trouble came after the second hill, during the 
part of the course where the vehicles must "choose which 
of the white lines to follow. Pajamas stalled out after Gate 9, 
apparently unable to decide.
Gannon and Daniel Dewey, the creators of Pajamas and both 
first-year computer science majors, started working on the 
mobot in October. Their greatest challenge: The cracks in 
the sidewalks, said Dewey. One thing that Pajamas can do 
is make decisions and know how to behave based on the 
number of gates its crossed. This is how Pajamas knows 
when it is at the point of the course where it must make a 
choice. Another challenge may be solved in future years with 
a little collaboration. We would have appreciated a MechE, 
said Dewey, noting that the task is mostly a mechanical one 
rather than a programming challenge.
Some undergraduate teams were less fortunate. Mission 
Possible, a rather small tri-wheeled vehicle with a collection 
of wires poking out of its top, had the first run of the day. It 
got about a foot, then veered off the course in a disappointing 
foul. On its second run, Mission Possible again'stalled no more 
than five feet from gate 0 (the starting gate). Del Salvador,
another undergraduate entry, was unfortunate in that it 
took a wide right about 10 feet into the course. Del Salvador 
also resembled a remote-control vehicle and moved with 
breakneck speed. But during both of its runs it seemed to 
forget to follow the line.
Open Class
The open class was sparse pickings and ended up being 
dominated by a competitor who knows the race very well. 
John Palmisanos mobot Pikachu won the open class prize, 
becoming the third mobot to earn Palmisano an award. An 
alumnus from the mechanical engineering department, 
Palmisano won the judges choice award last year and third 
place two years ago when he was a senior. Pikachu couldnt 
blast through the course on its first run, though. The mobot 
stalled out and freaked after a hard right, but it came back 
big in the second run. After minor adaptations to the trash 
bag skirting its edges, Pikachu scurried off along the line. It 
quickly made it to gate 8 before ignoring some of the vital 
gates in the decision portion of the course.
A particularly interesting addition to the open class was the 
group The Young Ones, led by a PhD student in psychology 
and his two young daughters. This diminutive mobot didnt 
get far, but it was great to look at. It had a tiny front wheel 
and two bigger back wheels. On its second run, the younger 
daughter, Victoria Douglass, placed a small stuffed cat on 
top of the vehicle. Though it never made it to Gate 1, it was 
charming in both its size and additional decor.
Exhibition Class
In the exhibition class were some old favorites and a new 
addition that was a crowd favorite. One of the few mobots 
not strongly resembling a motorized car, The Little Dog was 
actually the most expensive participant ever entered in the 
race. The body is a quadruped robot named LittleDog and 
manufactured by Boston Dynamics. Its operator, Michael

Dille, made a few adaptations so that it could run the mobot 
course. Visible additions to bring The Little Dag to mobot level 
were some taping of the paws and the addition of a massive 
camera on its back.
The Little Dag had some issues, however. First of all, it moved 
at a sluggish pace. And second, the robot, seemed attracted to 
the white dots that sometimes frame the line along the mobot 
course. The Little Dag only made it through Gate 1 with a little 
nudging to get him back on the line. And he crashed going 
down the first hill, toppling over and knocking his camera into 
pieces.
Though only a few mobots got past Gate 1 this year, it's worth 
noting that the challenge is by no means an easy one. As 
Brown said, It was the eighth year [of Mobot] before anybody 
[finished the course]." Over the 12 years that Brown has been 
judging, the main change he noted was the shift to video 
cameras over other varieties of sensors.
Behind the Mobots
Later, at the 15th Gate Ceremony (so named because it follows 
the races and there are 14 gates on the Mobot course), Brown 
allowed the three teams who earned prizes to come up and 
discuss their creations. Gannon and Dewey explained how 
Pajamas made it through the decision points using its sensors. 
The robot is told that its first priority is to avoid putting its 
rightmost or leftmost sensor on the line, and in its zeal to 
comply it causes the mobot to turn.
During its runs, Pajamas seemed to stall out for a moment on 
the cracks in the sidewalk. Dewey explained how the mobot 
kicked itself into gear again. We have a function called Dont 
get stuck,'" he said. If the sensor information is the same ... it 
revs up the motor. In other words, if the mobot is staying still, 
the sensor can tell its not getting new information and the 
engine gives it the extra boost to make it past the cracks.
Next, Pikachus "master Palmisano told of his very different 
idea about how to build a mobot. He used a simple design and 
chose to go with photoresistors that pick up green light, which 
he claims the white Mobot line reflects more than other colors. 
Pikachu was built in three weeks, said Palmisano. Explaining 
the choice of photoresistors over an infrared emitter detector, 
he said, "I was lazy.
Finally, the judges choice winners, The Yaung Ones  Scott 
Douglass and his daughters Victoria and Rebecca  spoke 
about their mobot. Douglass' daughters have been watching 
the races for years, he said. "Its ... better when you get to 
participate, the youngest Douglass noted. Scott Douglass also 
explained that this mobot was an adapted LEGO kit, which 
might explain its small stature.
Whether big or small, however, mobots add a certain flair to 
Carnival. Amongst the parties, booths, and shows of athletic 
prowess like Buggy, the mobots remind us of the things we 
are most often recognized for. Carnegie Mellon: technically 
minded, and proud to show it.

of time obviously spent on it. There were so many intricate 
details in the booth that one walk-through was definitely 
not enough to take it all in. The outside wall of the booth 
featured a rendition of the Abbey Road album cover, complete 
with head cut-outs so you could be a Beatle too. The details 
and planning of their booth came to life more vividly on the 
inside, as different sections of the booth imitated themes 
from various Beatles songs  an octupus garden for "Octopus 
Garden," a strawberry field for Strawberry Fields Forever," 
and a penny lane for Penny Lane.
And KGB? The group deviated from its usual Russian theme 
to produce a unique booth based on the lost colony of 
Roanoke Island. The resulting booth had a unique character 
exemplifed in its game, "Zombie Skeeball. If you didnt play 
it, you missed out. All three of these booths encountered few 
problems during the course of Carnival.
The big surprise was the lack of problems for usual suspect 
Alpha Epsilon Pi. AEPis The Ancient Aztecs" didn't 
collapse. On the contrary, the booth itself was very well-built 
and authentic-looking. However, it was the game inside
 made of lasers and pyramids  that pushed the booth to 
another level. It was obvious that a lot of time and energy had 
been invested in making the game fun, and it was time well 
spent.
Time was a huge factor in this year's Carnival, for both visitors 
and organizations. Most visitors ended up spending a lot of 
time in two huge lines for two impressive booths: Sig Eps 
Long Ago in a Galaxy Far Away" and Kappa Delta Rhos 
"Arabian Nights. Both of these organizations exploited 
the fact that they have many computer science majors in 
their respective brotherhoods, and they used them to make 
amazing games inside their booths. KDRs booth even 
provided a magic carpet ride  visitors had the opportunity 
to use virtual reality technology to steer the magic carpet on 
a quest. Tom Kaczynski, a civil engineering major who served 
as booth chair for KDR, said, We were worried about putting 
together the dome and the actual-walls. We basically did that 
after Move-On. Raising the palm tree in front of our booth was 
also really difficult because the tree was heavy. However, we 
think that our booth came together well.
From spring break onwards, the brothers of Sig Ep worked 
night and day to make their booth true to the original Star 
Wars; they began Move-On by riding in singing the Star 
Wars theme. The Death Star was complete with video games 
programmed by the brothers. Even better, the booth had a 
life-sized version of Yoda. Seriously, how do you beat that?
The Asian Student Association gave Sig Ep a run for its 
money. It didnt matter which way you went through the 
ASA booth, the prize-winning booth was an adventure from 
start to finish. The two-floored Alice-in-Wonderland-themed 
booth directed the audience from the entrance to the finish 
with signs quoting the popular Disney movie. Life-sized 
White Rabbits  chicken-wire skeletons with newspaper 
skin, decorated in felt  decked out the rooms within the
It started off with a bang: The opening of Midway was 
marked by the moving Another Time and Place sign falling 
off the arch. This slight mishap was probably one of the best 
indicators of Thursdays Carnival opening.
The next problem with the opening of Carnival was probably 
the delay of most of the booths. At 3:30 pm, eight of the 18 
booths were still under construction. Carnival officially began 
at 3 pm, which made nearly half of the booths late. Most of 
these organizations took the first hour as their down time, 
closing down their booths to do minor repairs or, in most 
cases, to finish painting. For the average Camival-goer, it was 
slightly annoying to realize that the most attractive booths, 
such as Kappa Delta Rhos Arabian Nights or Sigma Phi 
Epsilon's Long Ago in a Galaxy Far Away," were closed.
One booth that was open by the 3 pm deadline was the Fringe 
booth, "Merlins Workshop." Although small, the booth was 
filled with details that helped transport the visitor to Another 
Time and Place. On one table, there were bottles that moved 
by themselves. We didnt have all that much manpower to 
build the booth, said booth co-chair and first-year physics 
and statistics major Becca Reesman. Along with co-chair 
Emily Brayton, a senior architecture major, Reesman began 
building the booth at the beginning of March. Reesman 
added, It looks really good at night, because of the booth's 
constellations. At night, moonlight trickled in through them, 
creating an ethereal glow on the booth.
Heavy thunderstorms closed Midway bn Friday night for 
about two hours. Most booths suffered as a result of the rain, 
which led to problems like leaky roofs. Many booths also 
short-circuited, and 
the Carnival Committee 
had to eventually shut 
off power on Friday 
night at
around 6 pm. While many booths encountered water damage, 
like the Taiwanese Student Associations open-ceilinged 
booth, some had the foresight to prepare for such an event. 
One such organization was Alpha Chi Omega. Senior 
English major Amy Bickerton, one of Alpha Chis members, 
said, These arent ideal circumstances, but we were really 
prepared and made everything waterproof. The games 
of many organizations were also ruined as a result of the 
weather: ALLIES/cmuOUT's hopscotch game was basically 
washed out by the rain.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon faced some logistical problems with 
their game, too. On Wednesday, the Carnival Committee 
informed SAE that it was not allowed to use four-square as 
its booth game. According to the Carnival Committee, four
square was too dangerous to be played at Carnival. SAE 
was forced to change their game into target shooting (read: 
throw ball into crate).
Sigma Tau Gammas Gotham City booth also featured a 
game where contestants got the chance to Shoot the Villain." 
According to Sig Tau booth chair and sophomore music major 
Stefan Sullivan, "we had no problems during Move-On. Our 
faade wasnt really done before, but one of our members 
stepped up and basically did the entire faade by himself.
Kappa Alpha Thetas booth was also one that didnt encounter 
very many problems during the entire process. Based on the 
mythical city of Atlantis, Thetas booth was filled with water"
 simulated by the use of blue paper in odd shapes  as 
well as placards that detailed facts about Atlantis. In addition, 
the booth was filled with games that were interesting and 
appealing.
Three other booths that deserve 
mention are Delta Gammas The 
Wild West, Delta Delta Deltas 
"Beatles Magical Mystery 
Tour, and KGBs "Roanoke 
Island. DGs booth was 
popular among all the 
fraternities on the 
Midway. Rumor has it. 
that the frats were all 
competing to see who 
could steal the fivefoot oxen constructed 
of wire and wood that 
guarded the booth. DG 
sister Eileen Angulo, a 
sophomore psychology 
major, wasn't too 
perturbed and said Eh... 
boys do that.

booth, and the trippy feel of the adventures Alice experiences 
in Wonderland was enhanced by the paintings on the walls 
and the large representations of the popular characters from 
the movie.
Other booths that came together well this year were the 
blitz booths. Some were as impressive as the competitive 
booths, despite smaller sizes and shorter preparation times. 
Particularly noteworthy was the Conestoga wagon built by 
Forbes House and Global Studies, a collaboration known as 
"Forbals." Although they originally had problems obtaining the 
lumber, they managed to complete their Oregon Trail-themed 
blitz booth in time. The details, such as the Apple II logo 
and the MECC floppy lying outside the booth, made it even 
more attractive. And those geniuses even waterproofed their 
canvas. Booth co-chair Gwendolyn Barr noted, The end result 
was great even though everyone involved in building the booth 
was a freshman, so we had no idea what we were doing.
Other excellently detailed blitzes were the ones constructed 
by the Society of Women Engineers (a '50s diner) and 
Hamerschlag House (We Love the 70s); the exacting artwork 
on both exteriors and interiors of the MudgeWood (Morewood 
E and Mudge) and the ALLIES/cmuOUT booths are also worth 
mentioning. In the MudgeWood booth, the huge version of 
Nemo, from the Disney movie Finding Nemo, 
was well worth the trip. The ALLIES/ 
cmuOUT booth was covered in 
rainbows, referencing their 
Somewhere Over the 
Rainbow theme.
The booths and blitz booths were worth the time and effort 
all the organizations put into them. Despite the rain, most 
remained amazing works of art throughout Carnival weekend.

Thats not a mon.... Its a booth!
The brothers of Sigma Phi Epsilon were all wearing shirts 
with this phrase  a parody of a famous line from the first 
Star Wars film  on Saturday, as they prepared for their booth 
to be judged. Storm clouds loomed on the horizon, and the 
fraternitys booth crew was ready to throw a tarp over their 
masterpiece at the first hint of rain.
Carnivals 2006 theme was "Another Time and Place, and Sig 
Ep went with a Star Wars theme for their booth. The fraternity 
had to select their theme six months ago, in October. From 
among a half-dozen choices, the brothers selected Star Wars. 
With that, a booth was bom.
The path from October to the awards ceremony on Saturday 
afternoon was a long and arduous one. Sig Eps booth chair, 
Travis Brier, a junior electrical and computer engineering 
major, estimated that approximately 8585 man-hours went 
into the design and construction of the groups booth  at 
least 568 of which were his own.
We probably spent 10 hours designing it," said fourth-year 
architecture major Coleman Rusnock, one of Briers righthand men. "Travis spent about 80-90 hours on Autocad, 
estimated Rusnock. Brier had to teach himself how to use 
the professional computer-aided design program before he 
could create a virtual replica of the fraternitys booth design. 
While Rusnock designed the booth, Brier made sure the 
design would stay practical. Its good to have an engineer 
grounding you, Rusnock said. I did a lot of artsy drawings
 perspectives with details. Travis would take that and put it 
into usable building plans.
Meanwhile, third-year architecture student Brian Kish began 
work on the groups pice de rsistance: a huge, scaled-down 
version of the Millennium Falcon. It has become a bit of a 
tradition for the fraternity to roll out an intricate part of their 
booth, a "trump card, as Brier called it, at the last minute. 
Last years booth, "How Rock n Roll Works, featured an 18- 
foot guitar that was unveiled at the last minute.
Kish didnt build the Falcon alone, though. Just like every 
other piece of the booth, dozens of brothers pitched in to help. 
Over spring break, on St. Patricks Day, the brothers spent 12 
hours cutting arcs out of $2000 worth of three-quarter-inch 
plywood. They mounted a saw blade on the end of a 16-foot 
lever arm and cut more than 200 individual arcs for use in the 
Death Star dome. It was the best St. Pattys day I ever had, 
Brier said.
That dome became one of the most distinguishing 
characteristics of their booth. Since Sig Ep had secured a 
comer plot on the Morewood lot, the massive 1200-pound 
dome was immediately visible as patrons walked onto 
Midway. No one has ever done a two-floor dome completely," 
commented Brier.
There were reasons for that, of course. During Move-On on 
April 14, the dome proved to be one of the hardest parts of

first place at this year's Carnival.

the booth to relocate to the Morewood lot. That evening, 
down the road, another fraternity was loading their booth 
piece-by-piece onto a flatbed truck. The brothers of Sig Ep 
were crowded at the top of the hill waiting to move their 
booth. From amid the crowd, a brother shouted out, "Thats 
cheating! Another shouted, Weak! In a few minutes, the 
brothers of Sig Ep were manually guiding their massive booth 
down the hill and across Morewood Avenue, using only a 
large platform on casters.
A walkie-talkie crackled to life, and Sig Eps escorts from the 
Carnival Committee gave the order to start moving the booth. 
Brier, at the head of the crowd, shouted, "Lets go! With 
that, the brothers began their descent down the hill. Spotters 
shouted out directions as the mass tried to move in sync, 
making sure they didnt get too close to either curb.
The gate to the parking lot between New House and Mudge 
was a significant chokepoint. The booth and its carriers 
had to slow to a stop and rotate. "Were going to rotate 
counterclockwise! shouted Brier, making an exaggerated 
hand motion high in the air. That was clockwise! shouted 
another brother, and Brier quickly corrected himself: "Were 
going to rotate clockwise!  The brothers made it through the 
gate and onto their designated plot in the parking lot.
As the brothers marched across Morewood Avenue, they' 
began singing John Williams famous Imperial March.
They were determined to make a grand entrance, and as a 
reward once they finished the move, Brier revealed that their 
R2-D2 model was full of cans of Red Bull to keep the brothers 
working.
Later that night, the brothers finally managed to move the 
dome to the Morewood lot.. With fewer than six days until 
Carnival opened, their booth still needed lots of work, and 
starting that Sunday night, the brothers started 
working on the booth 24 hours a day.
Brier, as booth chair, remained 
on site as much as he 
possibly could.
The last five 
days of being 
awake
were pretty rough, said Brier after the awards ceremony 
on Saturday. Even with the brothers working constantly, 
their booth was not quite finished by 3 pm on Thursday, 
when Midway opened. Each booth is allowed four hours of 
down time to remain qualified for judging, and Brier made 
the decision to take two hours of down time at the start of 
Carnival to finish painting one final room and putting in the 
finishing touches.
The extra time was well worth it. Brier guessed that between 
2000 and 3000 people went through their booth in the two and 
a half days it was open. The booths three games were likely 
to thank for much of the traffic  the booth featured a TIEfighter shooting gallery, complete with an articulated chair 
and joystick; a "force push game, which used a webcam to 
sense the movement of players hands; and a surprisingly 
difficult Star Wars trivia game. Junior computer science 
major Chris Deleon programmed the shooter and the trivia 
game; senior computer science major Tommy Nourse said the 
shooter was our best game ever.
Sig Eps incredible dedication to detail was exemplified by a 
replica of Han Solo frozen in carbonite. To create the effect, 
the brothers coated senior mechanical engineering major 
Derrick Steigerwalt in plaster gauze and made a mold of his 
face. When we pulled the mask off he was in a lot of pain, 
said Rusnock. "He lost 12-13 eyelashes. His eyes were all 
caked over; he couldnt see.
It all came together when Brier, Rusnock, and Kish stood on 
stage in the Main Tent on Saturday afternoon and accepted 
their first-place trophy for fraternity booth. "You dont even 
know how many all-nighters went into this, said Rusnock 
during tear-down on Sunday.

You will feverishly await announcement of next years Carnival theme. 
You need to figure out a way to adapt your greatest booth themes 
yet - Five minutes ago, in my bathroom" and In the study, with the 
candlestick" - to a theme other than Another Time and Place."
Carnival is over, and your Mobot-Buggy-Booth transformer has aban
doned you to venture to Japan, where his kind will be accepted and 
understood. It will send you postcards every few months, but they will 
be harsh reminders of your creations intolerance-laced past.
Your life will be overcome with joy this week when you find something 
even cuter and more wonderful than a kitten or a puppy, or some sort of 
abominable hybrid of the two, in your laundry hamper: your tax refund. 
Also, Uncle Sam doesn't need a litter box.
In a personal first, Carnegie Mellon police will mistake you and your 
friends for homeless people. Perhaps passing out on a grate near the 
IM fields after spending five days working on a project without sleep 
wasn't the-best idea - certainly not when youre covered in more filth 
than you find in an issue of Hustler.
Your summer job search has gotten desperate, but your plan to work 
five part-time jobs at eight hours per week each will not work out as 
well as you hope. Instead, it will end with you in a fetal position after you 
mistakenly offer to Xerox someones fries.
Heavy rains will lead to more heavy rains, which will then in turn lead 
to even more heavy rains. You will hypothesize that this is signaling 
the impending apocalypse, but really it just means that its spring in 
Pittsburgh. Wait until Baker Hall floods again: Thats when the party 
starts.
As finals week approaches, you will discover that all your classes are 
really simply variations on a single theme. That theme is "your life has 
lost meaning amid triple integrals and Laplace transformations.
After the stunning realization that Styrofoam releases artificial estrogen 
when heated up, you will immediately begin hoarding disposable coffee 
cups. While no one will know what you are planning, your army of 
hyper-realistic fembots will prove them all to be fools.
Someone will tell you that you have a fantastic rack. However, what 
they will not realize is that you are not female, and you will inform them 
that they have poor depth perception.
You will learn that everything is bigger in Texas, except the national 
debt. It is, in fact, gigantic everywhere.
You will get into a sticky situation when you sleepwalk into a fertility 
clinic. Unfortunately, as you cross the threshold you will trip over a 
curiously placed bucket of epoxy. Get it? Sticky situation? What did 
you expect, sicko?
Your editor will break the news: Unfortunately, you just arent funny. Try 
again next year.
