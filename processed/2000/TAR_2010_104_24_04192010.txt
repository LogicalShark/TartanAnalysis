Global entrepreneur and writer of Starting From Scrap Stephen Greer 
lectures to students in Carnegie Mlions Entrepreneurship Club.
COURTNEY WITTEKIND
News Editor
Last Thursday, entrepre
neur and budding writer Ste
phen Greer spoke to Carnegie 
Mellons Entrepreneurship 
Club, sharing his business 
experience and his new book, 
Starting From Scrap: An En
trepreneurial Success Story.
In Starting From Scrap, 
Greer recounts his story of 
almost 20 years in the scrap 
metal recycling business in 
Asia. A Pennsylvania native, 
he graduated from Penn 
State in the early 1990s, but 
found that jobs and intern
ships were scarce due to the 
recession. So in 1993, after 
hearing from a friend that the 
Asian market was booming, 
Greer set out on a mission to 
succeed abroad.
I couldnt find the jobs I 
wanted in the United States, 
said Greer in Thursdays lec
ture. A friend told me that 
he had a friend in Hong Kong 
and that there were so many 
business opportunities in 
Asias booming economy. I 
knew my dad had a lot of free 
airline miles hed been saving 
up, so I asked him for a free 
ticket to Hong Kong.
Greer got the ticket, head
ed, to Hong Kong, and was 
soon immersed in a business 
market that was strikingly 
different from what he had 
experienced in the United 
States.
Hong Kong is a very en
trepreneurial town  every
one in one way or another is 
their own boss, Greer said. 
I became completely caught 
up in that and fell in love with 
the city.
However, Greers entrance 
into the Asian market wasnt 
without its flaws. He started 
his own business, registering 
it as Hartwell Pacific, be
cause, as he said, Hartwell 
was my middle name, and 
I decided to use it because I 
didnt want everyone to know 
that I was the only one in
volved in my business. From 
there, he began to search for 
his place within Hong Kongs 
booming economy.
I looked at anything and 
everything: Christmas orna
ments, wood, hairnets, work 
gloves. There was a world full 
of opportunity; I just had to 
choose something and go for 
it, Greer said.
Greer eventually landed 
a deal with scrap-metal sup
pliers in Asia, initiating his 
entrance into the scrap metal 
and recycled metal business. 
There he found success, first 
in the sales of scrap metal 
and, eventually, in adapting 
his company to also recycle 
used metal, melting it down 
and reforming it into new 
stainless steel.
With this adjustment, 
Greers business soared, 
opening eight operations in 
seven countries in one and a 
half years. As he put it, By 
28 I was a multi-millionaire, 
which was of course a good 
thing.
In 2008, after achieving a 
turnover of $250 million, as 
well as selling Hartwell Pa
cific to Australias Smorgon 
Steel, he resigned from his 
position with Hartwell Pacific 
and became a senior adviser 
to Oaktree Capital, a global 
investment management cor
poration.
However, financial gain, 
Greer stressed, is not his ul
timate concern. Success is 
living the life you want to 
live on your terms  and Im 
not talking about money. The 
reality is that there is a limit 
to how much money can im
prove your happiness. But, if 
you find something that you 
like and that youre passion
ate about, that will take you a 
long way, Greer said.
Entrepreneurship Club 
member and Tepper gradu
ate student Justin G. Shaka 
introduced Greer as having 
an important outlook on 
entrepreneurship across the 
globe.
This holds true for many 
of the students in Entrepre
neurship Club, as Greers les
sons are especially applicable 
in todays global market. The 
current economic recession 
bears some similarities to the 
recession in the early 1990s, 
when Greer first arrived in 
Hong Kong.
According to Greer, pe
riods of recession can drive 
further exploration and valu
able risks.
Its a hard time to find a 
job in todays poor economy, 
Greer said, but its also a 
great time to start your own 
business. Bad economies can 
be great times to be entrepre
neurs.
Greer also expressed the 
valuable business lessons he 
learned due to his experienc
es across the globe. Its a big 
world  a global economy  
and people need to be think
ing about how they, and how 
their country, fit into that. 
These thoughts are 
echoed by Marc Faber, worldrenowned economist and au
thor of the Gloom, Doom and 
Boom Report. In his review of 
Greers book, he wrote that 
Greer proves with a fascinat
ing account of his business 
life that there are even more 
opportunities in Asia as coun
tries such as China, India, 
and Vietnam open up and lib
eralize.
Greers book is available 
now and has been listed on 
the South China Morning Post 
Bestsellers List.

The dissertation of Jessie 
B. Ramey, who received her 
Ph.D. in history in 2009 from. 
Carnegie Mellon, was recently 
honored with three presti
gious national awards, an 
honorable accomplishment in 
a field where even one award 
is praiseworthy. The first 
award was the John Heinz 
Dissertation Award from the 
National Academy of Social 
Insurance, typically presented 
to economists or public policy 
experts. Additional awards 
included the Lerner-Scott Dis
sertation Prize in Womens 
History from the Organization 
of American Historians  the 
top prize given in my field of 
womens history, said Ramey
 and the Herbert G. Gutman
Dissertation Prize from the 
Labor and Working-Class His
tory Association.
No stranger to the work 
ethic at Carnegie Mellon, 
Ramey received a Bachelors 
degree in social history from 
Carnegie Mellon in 1991 and 
earned two masters degrees 
from Sarah Lawrence Col
lege and Carnegie Mellon, in 
2002 and 2003, respectively, 
before earning her Ph.D. Af
ter her undergraduate degree, 
Ramey also helped to found 
the Undergraduate Research 
Office.
Rameys dissertation was 
unique in many aspects, draw
ing from the environment 
in the Carnegie Mellon his
tory department and on in
spirations from her past. Her 
great-great-grandfather, an 
immigrant from Scotland, had
to place his children in an or
phanage after being unable to 
provide for his seven children. 
Turning to the literature on 
orphanages, I quickly realized 
historians Tiad documented 
that the vast majority of or
phans in orphanages actually 
had one or even two living par
ents, often struggling through 
a family and financial crisis, 
Ramey said.
From this point, Ramey be
gan to focus her work on late 
19th- and early 20th-century 
orphanages in Pittsburgh, in
cluding both white and African-American children. It is 
the first full-length compara
tive study of black and white 
institutional childcare in the 
United States, said Ramey. 
With this in mind, her study 
underscores the continuing 
vitality of research on the interplay of class and race in the 
nations history, said history 
department head Joe Trotter.
Her study required inter
disciplinary skills, drawing on 
her research experience, quan
titative analysis, and database 
design. The co-directors of her 
dissertation, Steven Schlossman of Carnegie Mellon and 
Tera Hunter, now at Princeton 
University, were specialists 
in fields that complemented 
Rameys research.
She used very creatively 
the distinct set of faculty 
strengths in our department 
to create a dissertation 
that represents not only 
contribution to the field but 
also one that has strong links 
intellectually to what we do 
here in the Carnegie Mellon

IPausch remembered in Marinellis new book
Matt Ramme of Sporcle offers mentally stimulating diversions
SHWETASURESH
Editor-in-Chief
Late Carnegie Mellon com
puter science professor Randy 
Pauschs influence may have 
increased exponentially af
ter the Last Lecture, but, ac
cording to colleagues, he had 
been an inspiring individual 
to work with throughout his 
time at Carnegie Mellon.
In his new book The Comet 
and the Tornado, executive 
producer of the Entertainment 
Technology Center (ETC) Don 
Marinelli writes about his per
sonal transition from drama 
to computer science, as well 
as his time working at the ETC 
with Pausch.
Together, Marinelli and 
Pausch founded the ETC, the 
collaboration of left- and rightbrained thinking. Marinelli, 
with a background in drama, 
was the creative right-brained 
thinker, while Pausch, with a 
computer science degree, was 
much more left-brained.
The title of the book origi
nates in the nicknames of the 
two colleagues. Pausch called 
Marinelli the Tornado, re
ferring to his vibrant energy 
and creativity. While thinking 
of a word to describe Pausch, 
Marinelli came , up with the 
Comet.
Comet Randy burst upon 
the scene like an astral body 
... illuminating his secrets for 
living life to the fullest for mil
lions of folks who needed such 
guidance.... Comet Randy left 
millions of people stunned, 
amazed, happy, giddy, and 
seeing light where there had 
been only darkness, Marinel
li said in a Carnegie Mellon 
press release.
Marinellis motive behind 
putting the book together was 
two-fold. Pauschs name has 
been mainly associated with 
the creation of the Alice soft
ware, but he has also played a 
major role at the ETC.
Few know that the ETC 
really is the legacy of Randy 
Pausch, so I wanted to set the 
record straight, Marinelli 
said.
Secondly, Marinelli opines 
that Pausch is now viewed 
as a saint, and through this 
book Marinelli wants to bring 
some of the humanity back to
there were several recurring 
crossword puzzle answers. 
So he began quizzing himself. 
When flashcards just werent 
cutting it, Ramme built a web 
program for himself, and the 
first Sporcle game was born, 
challenging players to mas
ter the U.S. state capitals. 
Sporcle made its public debut 
as Ramme began to post the 
games online. Every time I 
put one up, it got played, Said 
Ramme.
In July 2007, Sporcle.com 
was featured with over 1500 
diggs on the site digg.com. 
Aydar recalls, After that, I 
was not surprised that [Spor
cle] would go far!
Since its original debut, 
Sporcle has been played over 
235 million times. It has been 
highlighted in publications 
such as The Boston Globe and 
The Times of London. Sporcle 
has also made the headlines 
of countless other college and 
university newspapers.
When asked what makes 
Sporcle so popular, Ramme 
claims: Its easy to use, easy 
to just jump in. [Sporcle] 
challenges you to want to do 
better next time. He also sees 
his creation as a form of ac
cidental learning [and] enter
tainment.
College students agree. 
First-year biological sciences 
major Katie Siewert discov
ered the game last semester 
when she saw her roommate 
playing it. Sporcle is unlike 
other ways to procrastinate. 
Its like a puzzle that exercises

Randy to lose the human... 
humanity is a great strength, 
he said.
Crystal Lee, a graduate stu
dent in lighting and design, 
heard Marinelli speak about 
his book at the United States 
Institute for Theatre Technol
ogy in Kansas City, Mo., and 
wanted to read more about it. 
Since the School of Drama is
closely affiliated with the ETC, 
I wanted to see how the ETC 
was formed prior to my com
ing to CMU, she said.
Marinelli hopes to write 
a second book in the future, 
but is currently focused on 
continuing to make the ETC 
a global initiative, recruiting 
people from around the world 
to contribute their left- and 
right-brained talents.

all of those chemistry lectures, 
how familiar are you with the

If you are the type of per
son who likes the challenge of 
quizzes like these, you are not 
alone. People from across the 
nation and around the world 
have discovered one of the 
most addicting game sites on 
the web: Sporcle.
Sporcle was created by 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus 
Matt Ramme. Ramme gradu
ated from the School of Com
puter Science in 1997. On the 
website, www.sporcle.com,
Sporcle characterizes itself as 
a source for mentally stimu
lating diversions. The site 
currently contains over 3000 
fast-paced games that chal
lenge users to beat the clock 
and input answers to various 
quiz questions. The quizzes 
cover a wide array of captivat

and popular culture trivia.
Considering its popular

that Sporcle was not origi
nally intended to go public. 
Instead, Ramme recalls ba

RAMEY, from A1
history department, said 
Schlossman.
To obtain the relevant re
search for her dissertation, 
Ramey was resourceful, ac
quiring records from, among 
other sources, the United 
Presbyterian Orphans Home 
and the Home for Colored 
Children in Pittsburgh. Both 
of these sets of records had 
never been used by research
ers.
We may end up that Jes
sies research becomes the
only res^rch on this topic 
that goes into depth on devel
opment of these two institu
tions, said Schlossman.
Ramey convinced both 
orphanages to permit her ac
cess, even interning with the 
Historical Society of Western 
Pennsylvania to help gain ac
cess to records.
In the end, she formed a 
relational database of 1597 
children from the two or
phanages and was able to, in 
Rameys words, provide new 
insight into the lives of work
ing-class families struggling
with the modernizing indus
trial economy and the ways... 
they used institutions for their 
purposes.
Within her dissertation, 
Ramey was able to re-conceptualize orphanages as 
serving the role of childcare 
institutions and she explored 
their influence on public pol
icy and the factors of gender 
and race.
By doing so, her disserta
tion also raised questions of 
the implications for todays 
policy concerning childcare 
and social welfare.

Researchers discover basis for prejudice

Staffwriter
Prejudice is an issue we 
have faced time and time 
again. In the media today, we 
often witness how movies, 
television shows, and music 
fortify and proliferate nega
tive stereotypes, stereotypes 
that have caught the eyes and 
ears of human-rights groups 
constantly throughout the 
past century.
For years, people have pon
dered the origins of prejudice 
and have often only resorted 
to speculation. Recent stud
ies, however, have suggested a 
new alternative that suggests 
that prejudice and racial ste
reotyping might, in fact, be ge
netic. Children with a genetic 
condition known as Williams 
Syndrome do not display the 
tendency to stereotype other 
people based on their race, a 
tendency that most children 
have from a very early age.
Previous studies have 
shown the presence of racial 
stereotypes to be prevalent 
in children as early as age 
three, to the same extent that 
these stereotypes are present 
in adults. Additionally, racial 
stereotyping has been found 
to be present in children with 
autism who have difficulties 
in social interaction and the 
development of social knowl
edge. However, according to 
www.labspaces.net, in this 
new study by Andreas MeyerLindenberg of the Central 
Institute of Mental Health, 
Mannheim and the University 
of Heidelberg in Germany, re
searchers showed children a 
series of pictures having peo
ple of different races and gen
ders, and asked the children 
to assign positive or negative 
features to them. Typical chil
dren made strong stereotypi
cal assignments for gender 
roles as well as for race, which 
was similar to results of older 
studies. However, in children 
with Williams Syndrome, al
most no evidence of racial bias 
whatsoever was found.
Williams Syndrome is a 
rare neurodevelopmental dis
order caused by deletions of 
about 26 genes from the long 
arm of chromosome seven. 
Children with Williams Syn
drome are known to have 
unusually friendly, natures 
because they lack the sense 
of fear that other people feel 
in various social situations. As 
this is the case, the findings in 
this new study support the no
tion that prejudice and racial 
stereotyping may be the result 
of social fear.
In the past century, scien
tists have made great advanc
es into the understanding of 
prejudice, its causes, and ways 
to change and prevent it. Ac
cording to Social Psychology, 
prejudice, from a psycholo
gists standpoint, is a hostile or 
negative attitude toward a dis
tinguishable group of people. 
When looking at prejudice as 
an attitude, it is important to 
consider its different levels. 
Even though we look down 
upon its explicit level, which is 
when individuals consciously 
show their thoughts, feelings, 
and actions, we often over
look its implicit level, which 
is involuntary, uncontrollable, 
and at times unconscious. It is 
this implicit level of prejudice 
we may more commonly expe
rience and must work harder 
to change.
The most prominent 
method used to reduce racial 
prejudice is to bring members 
from various different groups 
together and put them in a 
situation where they must 
rely on each other to achieve a
common goal. There is an ex
tensive amount of both formal 
and informal contact among 
the members, and there is 
equal status and social norms 
of equality among the mem
bers. Various techniques, in
cluding the jigsaw classroom
 a teaching technique that 
places students of different 
genders and ethnicities into 
groups  incorporate these 
ideas to combat prejudice 
from an early age.
From the studys findings, 
however, researchers hope 
to find ways to develop new
means of intervention de
signed to reduce discrimina
tory attitudes and behavior 
towards marginalized or vul
nerable groups. This is the 
first study to report the ab
sence of racial stereotypes in 
any human population, said 
Meyer-Lindenberg. As this is 
the case, the findings in this 
study may open a gateway 
into both genetic research and 
social psychology that may 
revolutionize our approach in 
combating prejudice by con
fronting the issue on multiple 
levels.
Chimeras: Merging 
different organisms

The ability to combine 
animals is an idea common to 
mythology in many cultures. 
The best elements of each 
animal were taken, forming 
a novel creature usually more 
powerful than its constitu
ents. This type of animal was 
given the name chimera. 
For example, the griffin, a 
combination of a lion and an 
eagle  both kings of their 
domains  was a legendary 
symbol of divine power. The 
pincoy is a combination of a 
man and a sea lion that brings 
fertility to the sea.
Although mythological 
chimeras do not exist, re
searchers have been able to 
combine features of animals 
using modern genetic tech
nology. Animal chimeras are 
formed when zygotes of dif
ferent animals are mixed and 
allowed to develop within a 
carrier organism.
This ability arises from 
our understanding of organ
ism development. After an 
egg is fertilized, cell division 
occurs until a large number 
of cells are created. However, 
these cells are all the same, 
and have not yet chosen a 
developmental path. This is 
to say that different cells will 
develop into different parts 
of the body; for example, 
some cells will develop into 
components of the digestive 
system, and others will devel
op into the brain. Before the 
cells choose a developmen
tal path, scientists are able to 
replace some cells with cells 
from another animal, wbich 
also have not chosen their
developmental path.
Chimeras have many uses 
in biological research. Ac
cording to www.timesonline. 
co. uk, research under Yutaka 
Hanazano, a professor in 
the Division of Regenerative 
Medicine at Jichi Medical 
University in Japan, has been 
able to grow chimpanzee 
pancreas in sheep.
Further development in 
this field may yield promis
ing results with other organs, 
and Hanazano believes this 
research may one day al
low sheep to become organ 
banks for humans who need 
transplants. His work was 
inspired by the lack of organ 
donors in Japan compared to 
other countries around the 
world.
Mouse chimeras are pop
ular among biologists, and 
can be used to study cellular 
processes. In one instance, 
mouse chimeras were cre
ated with human brain cells, 
which allowed researchers to 
observe human neural devel
opment.

A recent volcanic eruption 
in Iceland created mayhem, 
causing evacuations and wide
spread flooding in the country. 
Other parts of western Europe 
were affected as well, as volca
nic ash grounded planes.
While volcanic eruptions 
and ash become the center 
of the spotlight for breaking 
news, it is important to un
derstand the nature behind 
the fearsome and destructive 
power of volcanoes.
Most humans will only see 
the surface of the earth, but 
thousands of kilometers of 
molten rock exist beneath our 
feet, under the solid ground 
on which we live.
This molten rock is called 
magma, and it sometimes 
makes its way to the surface of 
the earth through volcanoes. 
The exit of magma can some
times be forceful, resulting in 
a volcanic eruption.
Usually, magma exists as 
solid rock, according to the
website www.howstuffworks. 
com. T*hiS<is because of the 
enormous 'pressure that ex
ists under the .earths surface, 
which prevents magma from 
becoming a fluid.
However, there are occa
sions when magma can rise 
closer to the surface when 
pressure is released. This is 
explained by plate tectonics, a 
theory that the earths surface 
is composed of interlocking 
plates that move in the inner 
regions of the earth.
Sometimes, the boundar
ies between these plates sepa
rate, allowing magma to rise 
between them. Other times, 
the plates will crash into each 
other such that the edges 
move downwards, which also 
forces magma to flow upwards 
between the plates.
The reason magma is 
forced upwards is a result of 
differences in density between 
the layers of the earth. When 
magma becomes more fluid, 
its density decreases relative 
to the rock by which it is sur
rounded. This is the same rea
son why helium balloons rise 
in air  the density of helium 
is less than that of air. Most 
magma eventually becomes 
trapped in magma chambers 
just below the earths surface, 
but some will find a way to the 
top.
Magma erupts because of 
the gases that become dis
solved in it. Again, eruption 
has to do with pressure; once 
the confining pressure of sur
rounding rock becomes less 
than the escaping pressure of 
gas, the gas will erupt out of 
the earths surface and carry 
magma with it.
The power of volcanic erup
tions is dictated by the amount 
of gas in the magma, as well as 
how resistant the magma is to 
its gases escaping. If the mag
ma has a higher resistance, 
more gas pressure can build 
up before it erupts, causing a 
stronger eruption.
A volcano describes any 
sort of opening on the earths 
surface through which magma 
or gases can erupt. While fre
quently associated with ex
plosive eruptions, another common 
type of eruption forms effusive 
lava, which is slow moving.
The reason why Icelands vol
cano is causing so much trouble 
is because of the force of the 
volcanic eruption, which sent 
columns of ash into the air. 
Wind has scattered ash into the 
atmosphere of many countries 
in Western Europe, preventing 
planes from flying. In addition, 
according to www.guardian 
co.uk, magma from 
eruption also melted
200-meter thick glaciers, causing extensive 
flooding that tore down bridges, roads, and 
homes. Ash in the atmosphere reduced vis
ibility to mere yards, and many people near 
the eruption had to evacuate their homes 
and find refuge in Red Cross shelters.
Although volcanoes are associated with 
fire and destruction, they play an im
portant role in shaping the earths 
surface. They are involved with 
the creation of islands, and 
volcanic rocks add nutri
ents to soil.

Natural particle accelerator foundScientists battle genetic diseaseStudy reveals how brain multitasks
CERNs Large Hadron Collider has been gaining distinction as 
the most powerful particle accelerator created by man, but what 
about those formed by Mother Nature? At the University of Bath 
in the United Kingdom, researchers have discovered that during 
thunderstorms, particle accelerators can be created in thunder
clouds. The existence of these natural particle accelerators has 
been theorized since J925, but they were only recently detected 
by the radio *waves they entitled.
The earth is const^ntty bombarded by high-enefgy particles 
from space in the form of cpjsmlp r^ys.; Thesepan femove elec
trons from molecules in the air. Free electrons can then be accel
erated upwards when they interact with the electric field from 
lightning. When many of theseeiectrons^rccderate upward, they 
form a sort of particle beam that traverses many atmospheric 
layers. The energy from a nuclear power plant would be needed 
to generate such a beam artificially. Scientists are worried that 
these electrons may be harmful to orbiting satellites.
By transferring DNA between eggs, researchers have man
aged to prevent genetic diseases involving mitochondrial,DNA. 
Mitochondria are parts of all cells that create energy for the cejl 
to use. * ' *
Under the direction of Shoukhrat Mitalipov of the Oregon 
National Primate Research Center in Beaverton, researchers 
performed experiments on rhesus monkeys, remvtng<the cell 
nucleus from one egg and replacing it with the cell nucleus of 
another egg. By doing so, they did not have to transfer any of 
the other cellular components between the eggs, which includes 
mitochondrial DNA.
This discovery can be significant in medical research, since 
defects in mitochondrial DNA have been linked to diseases such 
as diabetes. Researchers believe that one out of every 200 births 
is somehow affected by mitochondrial DNA mutations. Before 
tests can be performed on humans, ethicatcOfrceinskahd 
tions on human egg experimentation must be addressed.
A French research group has discovered that multitasking 
causes the brain to split into two halves, with each half focusing 
on one task. They monitored brain activity in a group of partici
pants who were told to perform a certain task. When only one 
task was being done, one side of the frontal lobe showed activity. 
When two tasks were being performed, both sides of the frontal
 lobe were active.
This may explain why multitasking is a dif
ficult process for the brain, or why perform
ing more than two tasks at a time causes 
one task to be forgotten. When subjects 
had to perform more than two tasks, their 
accuracy decreased. The study may also 
explain why choosing from a long list of 
items may cause irrational decisions, be
cause the brain forgets about earlier items 
as it reads new ones. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons

Research on chimeras may benefit medicinal and biological research
CHIMERA, from A4
this may sound like an attempt 
to create a supreme virus, the 
chimera can actually be use
ful for treating malignant 
glioma, the most common 
and fatal form of brain cancer. 
This kind of cancer cannot be 
removed surgically, and che
motherapy has proven to be 
ineffective. The chimera virus 
destroys malignant glioma, 
but does not cause polio.
However, there is always 
the darker side to research.
Chimeras may also have uses 
in biological warfare. Accord
ing to www.howstuffworks. 
com, geneticists have been 
able to increase the potency 
of various infectious diseases, 
such as smallpox and anthrax. 
During the time of the Soviet 
Union, a high-ranking bio

ered combining smallbox and 
ebola into one virus. The pos
sibilities are endless when it 
comes to chimeras. Diseases 
can be created that can re
main dormant in the body un
til an external source triggers 
its activation.
Research with human 
chimeras is only in its begin
nings, as work with human 
organs would require experi
mentation using human stem 
cells.
The debate about the eth
ics of using human cells for 
experimentation is divided.

Loyal Scot program has good intent, poor execution
i ornomo Anollrvn iff mnrnmnnfp f/-v* Kn/->/-tvtinfT n T *iml nomnnirrn fUnr n r\n* nfhnfCarnegie Mellon launched its 
newest alumni initiative, the Loyal 
Scot program, a few weeks ago. And 
while The Tartan supports efforts 
to create a stronger community and 
alumni network, we are not com
pletely sold on the new campaign.
The campaign is a reward system 
for alumni. Alumni who donate each 
year, volunteer at events, and keep 
their contact information up to date 
become Loyal Scots.
Its great that the university is 
reaching out to students and alumni 
alike to make sure that they feel con
nected to campus. The website, www. 
cmu.edu/loyalscot, is well designed 
and easy to use. It provides the re
quirements for becoming a Loyal 
Scot, a simple four-step process, and 
helpful information concerning how 
to complete each of those require
ments. It is a good source of infor
mation for alumni who are looking 
to reconnect. It also has a blog with 
videos from different Loyal Scots.
Despite this strong foundation, 
the program itself is cheesy. The 
slogan is Plaid to the bone. The 
website uses cutesy sayings like 
Wear your plaid on your sleeve and 
Show your Tartan pride. It notes 
that Scotty, our school mascot, is 
a charter member. Using these tools 
to get people involved makes it feel 
much more like a forced advertising
campaign than a program that re
wards the community for remaining 
engaged in campus after leaving.
Its nice to see that people who 
are dedicated to anything and every
thing Carnegie Mellon will be recog
nized. We know that talented people 
have gone through Carnegie Mellon, 
and we want to make sure they feel 
connected and welcomed back to 
campus.
We certainly want more people 
who went to Carnegie Mellon to give 
back once theyve left. This cam
paign appears to be a step in the right 
direction, but embracing these ideas 
would be enough without creating 
silly slogans and incentives.
Cutting faculty salaries lowers educational standards
The fact that the economy isnt 
doing too well is stale news. Stu
dents have experienced the rough 
economy through rising tuition and 
a serious dearth of jobs and intern
ships, have complained about it, 
and have finally learned to accept 
it. However, a recent study showed 
that it isnt just us students and pro
spective job hunters who are being 
adversely affected by the bad econ
omy, but the faculty of universities 
as well.
According to a survey conducted 
by the American Association of Uni
versity Professors, salaries for uni
versity faculty rose by 1.2 percent 
this year  the smallest increase in 
50 years. The survey also found that 
salaries decreased in one-third of re
porting universities. In fact, the situ
ation might be worse than indicated 
by the results, as part-time faculty 
members were not included in the 
survey. Many universities are lean
ing toward hiring more part-time 
faculty to replace tenured professors 
to cut costs. Furthermore, a number 
of universities also reduced funding 
for research, traveling, and sabbati
cals.
While budget cuts at universities 
are a necessary part of dealing with 
the current financial climate, it does 
present a rather worrisome situa
tion. The reputation of a university 
banks on the accomplishments of 
its faculty. Whether it be excellence 
in teaching or accomplishments in 
research, faculty members make a
significant contribution to the uni
versity. Faculty salary cuts might 
discourage students from going into 
academia. Further, if universities 
continue to hire more part-time fac
ulty to replace tenured faculty, the 
quality of education and research at 
the institution will decrease. Lack of 
funding for research will also reflect 
poorly on the quality of work gener
ated by the university.
Although we understand that 
taking certain drastic measures be
comes necessary in times like these, 
we also believe that reducing faculty 
salaries will have serious long-term 
repercussions. Universities should 
carefully consider all the long-term 
effects that such budget cuts will 
have before taking action.
Student responsibilities unchanged by moving prom
From being a chance to dress up 
and dance in the high school gym, 
prom has catapulted to becoming, 
at least in the state of New York, an 
excuse for teenagers to spend the 
night out clubbing in Manhattan or 
road-tripping to the Jersey shore. In 
an effort to curb the underage binge 
drinking that ensues, Pearl River 
High School in Pearl River, N.Y. has 
decided to schedule prom on a school 
night.
By making this decision, the 
school administration is infringing 
on what is certainly a parental as 
well as an individual responsibility. 
Students should be educated enough 
to understand the dangers associated with alcohol. They should also 
be aware of the health risks involved 
with excessive drinking. It should 
not be the schools responsibility to 
ensure that students make the right 
choice when leaving prom. By chang
ing the night of prom, all students, 
including those who were not break
ing the rules, are punished.
In light of the bad reputation of 
prom after-parties, parents need to 
be able to enforce better rules and 
restrictions on their children as they 
see fit. The school can assist, but 
cannot be responsible for making 
sure that every single student has 
returned home safely  the parents 
need to take care of that.
Changes such as shifting prom 
to a Wednesday or Sunday night, 
rewarding students with breakfast 
and recreational activities when they 
show up the next day, or punishing 
them by not allowing them to partici
pate in academic work if they dont 
are ineffective ways to deal with a 
larger problem. These are stop-gap 
measures that wont actually prevent 
students from embracing alcohol and 
late-night adventures on their prom 
night. The real solution is educating 
high school students about the risks 
and responsibilities that begin after 
prom ends, an education that doesnt 
fall solely on the school but must also 
be discussed at home.

Hey Tartans,
I hope that all of you had an excit
ing and wonderful Carnival!
Spring Carnival is one of the 
best displays of the community 
spirit that has grown over the last 
academic year, and once again the 
Carnegie Mellon the community 
came together to celebrate one of 
its greatest traditions in full force. 
A job well done to all of those who 
participated, whether it be working 
on Bpoth or Buggy, participating in 
the ScotchnSoda show, putting on 
the Spring Carnival shows, or help
ing organize the Spring Carnival ac
tivities and making Carnival safe for 
all students.
Earlier this month, students vot
ed in student government elections 
and elected me and Kate as student 
body president and vice president. 
We could not be more grateful for all 
of the support for our campaign, and 
we cannot wait to get the ball rolling 
on all of the initiatives and ideas 
that we advertised in our campaign, 
as well as those that will arise from 
your thoughts and suggestions for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Over the summer, Kate and I will 
spend a great deal of time working 
on a number of things to ensure that 
we hit the ground running not only 
on the traditional initiative front, 
but also by continuing to establish 
relationships with the rest of stuLir..R..I.Q.J.llLlIQ..
dent government and members of 
the administration when we arrive 
in the fall.
We will begin working on our ini
tiative to showcase our campus or
ganizations and student life to firstyears immediately to ensure that it is 
well planned, successful, and collab
orative with the Orientation staff.
We will also begin looking at 
sources of funding for our Executive 
Grant Program and structuring the 
first months worth of CMU Connect 
Socials.
To ensure that we are staying 
connected to you and that you 
can continue to learn about our 
work over the next few months, we 
encourage you to continue to visit 
www.acollegetobelievein.com to 
stay updated with our initiatives and 
work to improve Carnegie Mellon.
You can also follow us on Twitter 
at www.twitter.com/jarrettandkate 
or e-mail us at jarrettandkate@ 
gmail.com. We encourage your 
feedback and hope that you throw 
us any idea, suggestion, question, or 
concern anytime you want.
Again, many thanks to all of you 
who supported us in elections  we 
are confident that we can deliver to 
you all of the initiatives that we have 
proposed and more.
We hope all of you enjoy the last 
few weeks of classes, good luck on fi
nals, and well see you around cam
pus!

Peace Corps sex education in Africa is 
better than in U.S.
This letter is in response to 
Amanda Coles April 12 editorial, 
Abstinence-only education harms 
teenagers. I could not agree more 
with the points Amanda made in her 
article. She writes about the impor
tance of sex education that ensures 
teenagers are informed from a reli
able source.
The reason the article left such 
an impression on me was due to one 
of my friends blog posts that I re
cently read. My friend Lorena is cur
rently serving in the Peace Corps as 
a teacher in Burkina Faso. Her most 
recent entry includes her recap 
of Womens Day, celebrated on 
March 8 in Burkina Faso. She writes 
that it is the one given day to praise 
all women. Typical festivities in
clude men doing the cooking. Lore
na took the day as an opportunity to 
teach a group of her students about 
HIV/AIDS and contraceptives.
The Peace Corps provides its 
teachers with all the necessary 
supplies for sex education, includ
ing male and female condoms and 
a wooden penis and vagina. While 
such explicit teaching is almost un
heard of in American sex education, 
in Burkina Faso, high rates of infi
delity and infection make it an even 
more pressing need.
American policies could cer
tainly learn from the Peace Corps
model. No one is out there teaching 
people how to protect themselves. 
As Amanda wrote, [Teens will] get 
their information from less reliable 
sources, like the Internet, maga
zines, and TV. But by keeping safe 
practices secret, what are we really 
achieving? Lorena addresses this 
same type of misunderstanding in 
Africa. She writes about how men 
will list reasons not to use contra
ceptives, including superstitions. 
Ideas like these stem from a lack of 
education.
Lorena ended her post about 
Womens Day by highlighting the 
fact that she knows not everyone 
will agree with her teaching. But she 
points out that a persons health is 
a little more important than the fact 
of whether its right or not to use a 
contraceptive.
I hope that educators and policy
makers in our country can step back 
from the situation a little as well 
and question the goals of sex edu
cation. Does teaching students in a 
classroom really encourage them to 
have sex? I think the value of hav
ing an informed population is much 
greater than that risk.

Living out your narcissistic fantasies: A users guide
LfflERTQ THE EDITOR
Even free investigative 
journalism is expensive
A disease runs rampant in many 
university communities, and it isnt 
swine flu  or alcoholism, for that 
matter. Its narcissism, or what I like 
to call an Inflated Sense of Self.
Its simple to get: You take the 
attitudes embedded in arrogance, 
the look at me thoughts inherent 
in personal accomplishments, the 
self-servingness in egocentrism, 
the notion that we are better than 
everyone else in snobbery, the com
plimentary exaggerations that lead 
to delusion, and a fne dash of supe
riority. You puree this for a couple 
of years in a high-pressure blender, 
and you get a pulpy mixture that is 
the Inflated Sense of Self (ISOS).
Its not in any social psychol
ogy textbook yet, but in the future, 
somewhere between learning about 
prejudice (a.k.a. how our group is 
better than all other groups) and 
stereotypes (a.k.a. I can reduce your 
group to negative overgeneraliza
tions), college students will learn 
about the behaviors of their own 
kind.
As one example, we can take me 
as a hypothetical ISOS victim, and 
together we can flesh out the course 
of the disease.
I would say Im a pretty good 
writer. When I say pretty good 
writer, Im just being modest. I 
consider myself to be pretty damn 
good. Editors have on many occa
sions come crawling to me, begging 
to hear the melodic sweetness that 
is my writing.
Professors have e-mailed me
back regarding drafts telling me Im 
a clear, concise writer and have 
a unique twist on things, a com
ment that, of course, I construed as 
a strong compliment.
To fully indulge in the greatness 
that is me, I Googled Cynthia Peng, 
The Tartan and found numerous 
links.
Apparently, my articles have been 
selected for publication on a gamut 
of sites no one ever browses, but the 
fact that they were sitting out there 
waiting to be perused was enough 
to buffer my ego._______________________ I________
However, I 
relished in the 
thought that 
someone out there, 
far removed from 
me, took the two 
minutes to skim 
my haphazardly 
written yet 
supposedly brilliant 
article...
For example, I found a link on 
some random persons Xanga to an 
article I wrote about why Michelle 
Kwan should be President. Up until 
that point, I, along with the majority 
of the population, had completely 
forgotten about the cultural explo
sion that was Xanga.
However, I relished in the 
thought that someone out there, 
far removed from me, took the two 
minutes to skim my haphazardly 
written yet supposedly brilliant ar
ticle and posted it on Skating ar
ticles of the week for May 2008. 
There it was, thoroughly critiqued 
and deemed excellent enough to be 
thrust into the cyberworld. Never 
mind that May 2008 was long af
ter anyone had stopped keeping up 
with Xanga; the blog Kwantifiable 
deemed it of quality.
Some kids mom tracked me 
down to show her undue apprecia
tion for an exceptionally well-writ
ten article on her sons piano perfor
mance. My article on piano phenom 
Lang Lang was linked to a site that 
had been hacked, but that was okay, 
because at one point in time some
one cared enough to link it there in 
the first place.
After Googling myself for a while, 
I got bored.
Some of the links on sea urchin 
conferences or computer science 
competitions were clearly not me, 
and the fact that other people had 
my exact name made my narcissis
tic self highly uncomfortable. Also, 
I didnt want to dig deeper in the 
depths of the Internet just in case, 
heaven forbid, someone p9sted 
something negative about one of my 
articles.
Being narcissistic about my own 
writing took a lot of time and ef
fort.
My sense of self was no longer in
flated; I was back to normal again. 
Thus, having cured myself of the 
disease that so many of our peers 
suffer from, I decided to focus my 
energy on other things, like put
ting all my articles in one place just 
in case someone decides to write a 
Ph.D. dissertation on my unprec
edented and effortless talents.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@J will go on 
to win many prestigious awards for 
this article. .
The Tartans April 12 board edito
rial (Anonymity of Wikileaks could 
be future of journalism) highlights 
one very dynamic use of new media 
to pursue investigative journalism.
In an age when investigative 
journalism is being slashed from 
mainstream print news because of 
its prohibitive expense, theres a lot 
of anxiety over who will continue as 
the watchdog over the powers that 
be. The anonymous release of such 
an incredible piece of news on onceobscure Wikileaks  with its mys
terious investigative methods and 
clandestine connections to a nebu
lous ring of high-powered research 
institutions  induced an anxious 
fit of navel-gazing among new and 
old media alike about investiga
tive journalisms new future on the 
web.
But before we use the Wikileaks 
incident to declare that the world 
of information is flat, there remains 
one inescapable truth: Good jour
nalism, and especially the investiga
tive kind, still costs money, even if it 
appears on a fringe website.
Followers of the story know that 
Wikileaks is kept afloat, like many 
important wikis, entirely through 
donations. In January, The Guard
ian, a leading news source in the UK 
and a supporter of Wikileaks, wrote, 
If you want to read the exposes of 
the future, its time to chip in.
And theyre right: Wikileaks 
brought you a really interesting 
and important bit of news for free. 
But it still has battalions of servers 
to maintain in three different na
tions, staff to pay, and even people 
that travel and check stories out in 
person. Thats expensive, and like 
news on the printed page, theres no 
guarantee its going to stick around 
unless you are willing to pay for it.
Other journalists, hoping to use 
the community as a resource to 
fund this often-expensive process, 
have banded together on a site 
called 12Spot.us. Spot is a very 
simple concept: People who would 
like to write a news story, but dont 
have the funding necessary to do 
the journalistic work, can pitch a 
story to, well, you. And everyone. 
Story ideas are listed online, and if 
you like the idea, you pan give the 
future author a donation to start or 
complete- his or her work. Wouldbe writers list how much they need 
(usually a few hundred bucks), 
what they would like to cover 
(Agriculture Poisons Water for 1.3 
Million in San Joaquin County), 
and what their qualifications are.
In the short term, the idea of in
dividuals and groups paying for the 
investigative journalism they want 
to see instead of turning to large 
newspapers is exciting, and not so 
unlike hiring a private investigator 
instead of relying on the police. In 
the long run, though, sticky ques
tions may arise about whether its a 
good idea to introduce such a clear 
bias in journalism. Its going to get 
very hairy when large, civic-mind
ed, and (mostly) unbiased print 
newspapers no longer provide in
vestigation as a public service.
Either way, the moral of the 
story is that a free press is actually 
quite expensive. If youd like to con
tinue benefiting from the contribu
tions that high-quality investigative 
journalism makes to a free society, 
its going to cost you. And youd bet
ter pay up.

Segregation in public schools restricts students opportunities
MICHAEL KAHN
Half a century after Brown v. 
Board of Education, a recent Wash
ington Post story began: A federal 
judge Tuesday ordered a rural county 
in southwestern Mississippi to stop 
segregating ... African American stu
dents into all-black classrooms.
That such a lede, much less the 
actual event, can exist today is an em
barrassment to our nation. It evokes 
a darker past that seemingly is still 
present, one in which fundamental 
human rights were denied.
The Walthall County school sys
tem has for years allowed white 
students to transfer from predomi
nantly black schools to a school that 
has mostly white students. The end 
result of these transfers is the cre
ation of many segregated classrooms 
and disproportionate enrollment at 
different county schools.
Racially motivated transfer op
tions are not the only problem with 
the Walthall County schools. Segre
gation exists even within individual 
buildings. Schools often grouped 
white students into a few specific
classes, meaning that even schools 
that had an overall diverse popu
lation were often segregated on a 
smaller scale. There was a predomi
nance of classes that had only white 
or only black students.
Though this transfer process may 
not be as direct as the legal discrimi
nation that existed in the Jim Crow 
era, its final effects are similar, and 
its premise is just as terrible.
By dividing schools and class
rooms by race, Walthall County and 
its citizens are promulgating the rac
ist ideas that have plagued America, 
particularly the South, for so long. 
Instead of learning from diversity, 
students in Walthall County will only 
be exposed to views similar to their 
own.
One might argue that Walthall 
County is an anomaly, that the rest 
of the country understands the ben
efits of diversity. But then one looks 
to Raleigh, N.C., where the Wake 
County school board decided last 
month to discard a commitment to 
diversity in schools, according to 
The News and Observer in Raleigh. 
Though this decision was made to 
create community-based schools and 
not expressly to encourage segrega
tion, it still indicates a decreased em
phasis on diversity.
If the United States is to continue
its progress toward a more equal so
ciety, the next generation must be 
able to appreciate diversity. This re
quires exposure to different people 
and ideas, forcing students to re
evaluate their beliefs. If school popu
lations are monolithic, this exposure 
will not happen, and it will be that 
much more difficult to progress as a 
society.
In the hours and days after the 
2008 Presidential elections, many 
pundits claimed that America had 
developed a post-racial society. 
They proposed, despite widespread 
evidence to the contrary, that the 
nation was colorblind. Instances like 
the one in Walthall County show that 
these claims are merely idealistic 
hopes. The reality is that discrimina
tion and racism still exist, and they 
remain a way of life in many parts of 
the country. If we are to truly move 
past the era of racism, children must 
not follow in their parents footsteps. 
They must be able to recognize that 
diverse cultures are valuable.

Violation of fire safety rule knocks out SDC
The Cutoff Man
BASEBALL, from A10
Cardinals tied it off the Mets 
closer, one could only sit in 
awe, agony, disbelief and, for 
true fans, excitement that a 
modern-day game was hit
ting the 20th inning.
Even truer baseball fans 
appreciated that it was only 
1-1. Once the Mets finally 
put the game away in the 
20th, sighs of relief were all 
the rage.
Pitching and defense have 
been making a comeback, 
and never was it more present than on Saturday. The 
Mets are now one of three 
teams, along with the Padres 
and the Rays, that have never 
had a no-hitter thrown in 
team history. Im still waiting
 eventually some team has 
to come out of a game hitless 
at the hands of the Mets.
After all, as Danny Ozark 
once said, Even Napoleon 
had his Watergate.

BUGGY, from A10
black and white, said Sweep
stakes Chairman and gradu
ate student Jessica Thurston. 
Out of respect to the other 
organizations following the 
rules and for the safety of all 
student spectators, we have to 
be extremely strict about fire 
safety regulations. As such, 
after conferring with the fire 
marshal, the head judge, and 
our adviser, I had to uphold 
the call for disqualification.
Within minutes of the in
cident, SDCs head members 
were approached by Thurston, 
Anderegg, head judge Andrew 
Hundt (SCS 2009), and advis
er Kaycee Palko.
After learning SDCs side 
of the story, including their 
explanation about the origins 
and placement of the propane 
tank, the committee upheld 
the fire marshals disqualifica
tion of SDC, as SDC was pres
ent at the fire safety meeting
and signed an acknowledg
ment of the Sweepstakes by
laws and their consequences.
We had all the intention of 
following the rules; we knew 
that the rules said no liquid 
or gas near or in the stag
ing area, Kessler said. We 
placed the tank far away from 
the area. We never turned it 
on at all, and it went from my 
car up the hill, never in or near 
our truck.
He continued, At first most 
of us were just in shock. We 
were all really sad, and there 
was a lot of anger on every
ones part. We appealed and 
explained to everyone, but the 
Sweepstakes chair kept the 
decision.
According to Thurston, 
such decisions are made joint
ly by the chairman, adviser, 
and the years head judge. De
cisions are then enforced by 
the head judge.
Fringe pusher Sara Wingen 
had mixed emotions about
the matter. The feeling is bit
tersweet. They were the only 
team ahead of us, and theyre 
great competitors.... Its disap
pointing to see them disquali
fied. Its easier to run when 
someone is chasing you, but 
this time we really had to find 
the internal motivation.
With three womens teams 
and two mens teams taken 
out, the opportunity was there 
for Fringe A to take home the 
trophy for both the mens and 
womens races, which they 
did. The Sigma Phi Epsilon 
mens A team and Pi Kappa 
Alpha womens A team took 
second.
For the case of SDC, the of
ficial rules state that the maxi
mum penalty such an offense 
is a 15-month suspension, the 
application of which is yet to 
be decided.
In the 2009 Sweepstakes 
races, when Beta Theta Pi was 
found to have flammable liq
uid in a can inside its truck,
the group was allowed to roll 
the next year under a strict 
probation.
Disqualifying arguably 
the strongest buggy team 
on the course is something 
we never wanted to do, and 
something we did our best to 
avoid by having chairmen sign 
off on the bylaws and by sign
ing in at and attending the fire 
safety training meeting we 
held three weeks ago, Thur
ston said. We will continue 
to work with SDC to get them 
back out on the course as soon 
as possible, and I hope that fu
ture Sweepstakes committees 
can further clarify the rules 
surrounding fire safety and 
ensure that they are followed 
properly so we never have 
to deal with such a situation 
again.

Men grab second; women leap into fourth
TRACK, from A10
formance, taking third in the 
triple jump and fifth in the 
long jump in 9.86 and 4.73 
meters, respectively. In the 
javelin throw, first-year Carissa Iannone finished in fifth 
place, clearing 29.07 meters.
On the mens side, the Tar
tans won a total of five events, 
but it was the depth of talent 
on the team that allowed them 
to come in second place over
all. Junior Nate Bussiere won 
the 800-meter run in 1:55.12 
and was followed shortly by 
teammates junior J.P. Allera 
and junior Jonathan Matusky, 
who came in third and fifth, 
respectively, with times of 
2:03.22 and 2:06.70. In the 
100-meter dash, first-year 
Noel Titus grabbed second
with a personal best time of 
11.28, while in the 400-me
ter dash, fellow first-year Ben 
Nealy claimed third with a 
time of 52.31. Junior Justin 
Kurp managed a second-place 
finish in the 1500-meter run, 
followed by first-year Evan 
Gates, who took third, with 
times of 4:10.13 and 4:11.33, 
respectively.
Perhaps the most exciting 
moment of the day was when 
sophomore Kyle Andrews, se
nior Chris Rizzo, and first-year 
Ben Finch took the top three 
places in the 5000-meter run, 
in 15:49.48, 15:50.65, and 
16:11.44, respectively. Addi
tionally, in the mens 4x100- 
meter relay, the Tartans came 
out on top, winning the event 
in 44.31, with a team of firstyear Titus, first-year John Caverhill, sophomore Ryan Kissell, 
and senior Chris Bridgman.
. I am very happy with the 
time I ran and the teamwork 
used to get it, Andrews said. 
[We paced] well together 
and orchestrally [swapped] 
the lead so that no one person 
took on the wind alone.
On the field, the men con
tinued to succeed when junior 
Pat OBrien racked up two, 
third-place finishes in the high 
jump and the triple jump, with 
distances of 1.75 meters and 
12.84 meters, respectively. 
Bridgman continued to earn 
top points for the Tartans in 
the pole vault, with a height 
of 4.40 meters. In the long 
jump, Kissell took second by 
leaping 6.31 meters. Finally, 
senior James Hulley earned
20 points for the team by winning both the shot put and the 
discus throw, with throws of 
14.35 meters and 44.08 me
ters, respectively.
The team competed 
fiercely despite stinging rain, 
snow, hail, and winds, said 
Andrews. Also, in the absence 
of much competition, espe
cially in the distance events, 
some respectable times were 
churned out by several team
mates.... On the whole, the 
progress our team has made 
over the season is becoming 
more and more apparent, and 
I believe we are more than 
ready to destroy the competi. tion next week at UAAs.
The Tartans will be busy 
this weekend preparing for 
the UAA Outdoor Champion
ships to be held in St. Louis, 
Mo. on April 24 and 25.

The Cutoff Man: 
Pitching dominates
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Assistant Sports Editor
Half this game is 90 per
cent mental. Former Phil
adelphia Phillies manager 
Danny Ozark.
Were I ever to have met 
the late Mr. Ozark, Id have 
argued that 90 percent of the 
game is half luck. The strat
egy is what makes baseball 
such an intricate sport, but 
the true excitement and frus
tration stem from the skill 
and luck involved.
All factors were especially 
apparent in two games on 
Saturday. The Colorado Rock
ies Ubaldo Jimenez pitched 
the first no-hitter in fran
chise history, shutting down 
the Braves in Atlanta as the 
Rockies rolled to a 4-0 win. 
The Mets and Cardinals, on 
the other hand, went head to 
head for 18 scoreless innings 
before each team scored a run 
in the 19th. The Mets came 
out on top, 2-1, after 20 very, 
very long innings.
The Braves have now been 
the victims of no-hitters in 
Atlanta twice in the last six 
years. Randy Johnson, as a 
member of the Arizona Dia
mondbacks, became the old
est pitcher to pitch a perfect 
game when he shut down all 
27 Braves he faced at Turner 
Field on May 18, 2004. Hav
ing no hits doesnt necessar
ily mean a team has poor hit
ting; it means the guy on the 
mound is nasty. It also means 
hes got a whole lot of luck.
When Chicago White Sox 
pitcher Mark Buehrle pitched 
a perfect game last July 23 
against Tampa Bay, his out
fielder DeWayne Wise made 
a leaping, falling catch to rob 
the Rays Gabe Kapler of a 
home run and preserve the 
perfect game. That was pure 
skill on the part of Wise; it 
was pure luck on the part of 
Buehrle.
So it was that Ubaldo 
Jimenez took the mound on 
Saturday with Dexter Fowler 
in center field. The 6'5" Fowl
er is known for his speed, and 
he certainly put it on display 
to help the cause in Atlanta. 
With two incredible catches, 
one of them a completely 
sprawling, breakneck diving 
catch, Fowler saved the day 
for Jimenez and gave him 
the confidence that he could 
do something special on that 
mound.
To me, there is nothing 
more awe-inspiring than a
pitcher throwing a no-hitter, 
especially a perfect game. 
My brother Linus was lucky 
enough to be at Yankee Stadi
um 6n May 17,1998  Beanie 
Baby Daywhen New Yorks 
David Wells threw a perfect 
game against the Minnesota 
Twins. My dad was almost 
as lucky  he got to see the 
Mets Tom Seaver take a per
fect game into the ninth in
ning before it was broken up.
Pitching a no-hitter is the 
ultimate accomplishment. It 
shows how dominant a pitch
er can be. Every team has 
great players, and even the 
lesser players are still good 
enough to make the major 
leagues. Everyone is capable 
of getting a hit. When Wells 
pitched his perfect game, 
Hall of Famer Paul Molitor 
and then-superstar Marty 
Cordova were in the lineup 
for the Twins, and both were 
silenced.
When Jimenez pitched on 
Saturday, he faced a potent 
lineup that included future 
Hall of Famer Chipper Jones 
and the prince of baseball, 
Jason Heyward. That lineup 
was silenced as well.
In St. Louis on Saturday, 
a game that was broadcast 
on FOX beginning at 4 p.m. 
ended a little after 11. While 
no pitcher was perfect, the 
Cardinals Jaime Garcia did 
have a no-hitter through the 
first five innings. The Mets 
Johan Santana was equally 
dominant, and after each 
starter exited after seven in
nings  Santana with nine 
strikeouts, Garcia with only 
one hit allowed  one could 
not help but think, What an 
excellent pitchers duel. This 
is going to be a great finish.
And it was. Eventually.
Terrific defense helped 
save the day in this one as 
well.
The Cardinals loaded the 
bases with two out in the 10th 
inning before Matt Holliday 
lofted a foul pop-up towards 
the first-base stands. The 
Mets Alex Cora, hardly a first 
baseman by trade, jumped to 
catch the ball and landed in 
the seats, holding onto the 
ball to end the inning and 
lengthen highlight reels for 
years to come.
After the Mets scored in 
the 19th off the Cardinals

team pushes a buggy up Hill 5 on Friday.
In what most would hope 
to be a time of friendly com
petitive spirit and a culmina
tion of hard work paid off, the 
day of finals for Buggy races 
instead became a day of dis
appointment for the Student 
Dormitory Councils (SDC) 
Buggy teams.
Last Saturday, all five of 
SDCs mens and womens 
qualifying teams were disqual
ified due to a fire safety hazard 
near the groups staging area.
Going into the final day of 
racing, SDC was a dominant 
force on the leader board. Its 
womens A team rolled the 
third-best time in the history 
of Buggy for womens teams 
on Friday (2:28.14), and its B 
and C teams were in the top 
five spots as well. The mens A 
team, which raced in the pre
liminary heats on Friday with 
a very fast time of 2:04.61, 
was in first place going into 
the finals, and its B team was 
in third place.
Yet the rolls had not yet 
started Saturday before SDC
got knocked out of the run
ning.
. According to the report 
filed by fire marshal Robert 
Anderegg surveying the stag
ing areas of all of the Buggy 
teams, SDC members took a 
propane tank out of their truck 
and carried it away from their 
staging area. While the teams 
explanation was that the tank 
would be used to keep their 
pushers warm, its proximity 
to the staging area violated a
ganization was subsequently 
disqualified from racing in the 
finals.
The fire marshals response 
to SDCs outcry was that pro
pane tnks are not allowed at 
all in or in close proximity tp a 
teams staging area, sin;ce the 
gas will find a way to ignite it
self if allowed to escape from 
the tank.
The tanks presence was 
viewed by the head judge and 
the Sweepstakes Committee as
state NO quantity of ANY 
combustible liquid is permit
ted in or near the buggy prepa
ration areas, a condition that 
warranted SDCs disqualifica
tion. There is no clear defini
tion or set distance, however, 
of what constitutes near the 
Buggy staging area.
The violation was imme
diately refuted by the team. 
According to Julian Kessler, 
SDCs Buggy chairman, the 
propane tank was indeed pres
ent near the staging area, 
but was 20 feet up a hill from 
the buggy truck. Anderegg in

For many people, Ultimate 
Frisbee is a rather unknown 
sport. While the sport may not 
be as popular as football or 
basketball, Ultimate players 
are motivated and extremely 
hardworking. Carnegie Mel

since 1975, when only a handful of teams existed in the na

the team belongs to. The Ul

running and weightlifting 
workouts each week. Manag

traveling can be difficult, but 
the extra effort is worth it. Al
though many Ultimate players 
play Frisbee for the first time 
upon coming to college, the 
team consists of athletes from 
all sports backgrounds.

Orchestra dazzles audiences Everything you need to know
Performance transforms classical music into enthralling rock experience On drunk texting and Dracula wannabes
Dear Hoskins Brothers, 
1 got really drunk over 
Carnival and sent out a 
bunch of texts I shouldnt 
have. I texted my exes, 
my friends, even my mom! 
What should I do? 
Sincerely, 
Silly Lady Ordering 
Plenty of Premiums and 
Yuenglings 
Dear SLOPPY,
Im glad to hear someone 
had a good time. Just be 
glad that the worst thing you 
did was send out a few drunk 
texts  things could have 
been a lot worse. First: texting 
your friends - not a big deal. 
Just blackmail them from 
the last time they got drunk. 
You know those photos you 
deleted? Now for your 
mom. Congratulations, she 
officially knows you drink. 
Shell chew you out over the 
phone tomorrow. Just put her 
on speaker in the other room 
and do some homework.
Now for the exes. Were 
you sexting? (You can send 
me the details in private for 
more thorough advice.) Im 
going to assume you dont 
actually want to see your ex. 
So heres what you should 
do: deny, deny, deny. Pull an 
Alberto Gonzalez  I do not 
recall. If hes trying to restart 
something, ignore him. But 
if hes persistent, just let him 
know: You were drunk and it 
was a mistake. You got rid of 
him once; you can do it again. 
Now the real problems come 
if you mixed up your texts. I 
cant help you with that.
Hope you didnt sext your 
mom, 
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers, 
My girlfriend keeps trying 
to get me to watch Twilight 
and New Moon with her. 
She always compares 
me to some dude named 
Edward. Who is this guy? 
And why is my girlfriend 
obsessed with vampires? 
Sincerely, 
Running Out of Blood 
Dear ROB,
Congrats, youre dating a 
crazy person. Like most 
girls nowadays, shes in love 
with vampires - specifically, 
Edward Cullen, the handsome 
star of the Twilight saga.
For some reason, girls 
everywhere are falling for pale, 
feminine-looking guys who 
respect them, love them, 
and "dont pressure them for 
a physical relationship.
Basically, it comes down to 
this  chicks dig six packs 
and glitter. (Yeah, vampires 
glitter now  Dracula is 
spinning in his grave.)
My advice: Hit up Skibo 
and the arts store. Do 
some sit-ups and use some 
craft supplies. Avoid direct 
sunlight. Make your hair look 
like you just stepped out of a 
wind tunnel.
Be brooding. Pay attention 
to her when she talks. Break 
into her house. You know, 
normal non-stalker-type stuff. 
Hey, it worked in the book.
Im more of a Jacob man 
myself,

The Trans-Siberian 
Orchestra is 
famous for 
taking classical 
songs and 
transforming them 
into powerful 
rock ballads.
The monologues advanced the plot while the music 
evoked the emotions of Beethoven, his beloved 
Princess Theresa, and the insidious Mephistopheles, 
among other characters. By the end of the show, the 
audience was as eager to follow the story as they 
were to hear the performance. -
Despite the nontraditional format, there was no 
mistaking the TSOs performance for anything but a 
rock concert. The Benedum Center shook with bass 
chords and cymbal crashes, while the light show 
alone made the audience applaud throughout the 
night.
After the TSO finished the Beethoven's Last Night 
lineup, they treated the audience to selections from 
Night Castle.
This album, released last October, features 
adaptations of famous classical works like Carmina 
Burana and In the Hall of the Mountain King (The 
Mountain" on the TSO album), but it consists mostly 
of original compositions that draw from classical and 
modern musical traditions.
The Trans-Siberian Orchestra is a unique group, and 
Beethovens Last Night was a unique performance. 
Like the bands music, the show took seemingly 
different sources and combined them into 
something completely new.

When the Trans-Siberian Orchestra (TSO) played at 
the Benedum Center the night of April 4, it wasnt 
an average concert. The typical light and sound 
shows were present, certainly, but the atmosphere 
was very different from that of a small club or a large 
amphitheatre.
The TSO comes to Pittsburgh every year as part - 
of its winter tour, in which the musicians play 
selections from their Christmas-themed albums.
However, the-most recent performance was part of 
their Beethoven's Last Night tour, which focuses on 
the namesake album as well as the recently released 
Night Castle. Though many audience members had 
already seen the TSO in concert, this was a new 
experience for everyone.
The TSO was originally conceived as a progressive 
rock band by its creator, Paul ONeill. Its shows are 
rock operas and the groups rendition of Beethovens 
Last Night was no exception.
As the lights dimmed to begin the show, the band 
started into a rendition of the famous composers 
final night. As the clock strikes midnight, the devil 
Mephistopheles appears to him and offers him a 
bargain. At this point the dramatic reading stops, 
the lights come on, and the music begins.
These two atmospheres- were interspersed 
throughout the show. Over the course of the 
evening, the audience was transported back to 1827 
and experienced the trials of Beethovens last night 
with him.

Tales from abroad: Southeast Asia
One student reflects on the lessons learned during her community service experience abroad
These are the experiences; these are the stories that 
I carefully packed into my suitcases and bags as I 
returned home to the U.S. and entered Carnegie 
Mellon. Its those stories that have seemed, by far, 
the heaviest of everything Ive carried along with 
me from place to place. Often I misplace them, only 
to rediscover one hiding alongside my paintbrushes or 
scribbled in the margins of a page. Most of the time Im 
not sure what to do with these stories when I rediscover 
them, but I see them revealing themselves within much 
of my work here. They've been carefully rendered within 
my paintings. They've taken many, many forms  the 
academic and the artistic, the written and the visual, the 
premeditated and the unexpected.
Its all of these things, both in Southeast Asia and here 
at Carnegie Mellon  the deadlines and character 
counts, the peeling pages of classic fiction, the scent 
of turpentine late into the night, the foreign buses, 
mysterious food, long hikes, and customs desks  its 
all of these things that have created within me an 
unwavering passion for the telling of stories. Its the 
stories that drive me, and my hope is that one day, these 
stories will not remain untold.
Aside from wonderful service opportunities, Southeast Asia also provides its vistors with remarkable wildlife.
Courtney Wittekind | News Editor
As a student at Carnegie Mellon, my day-to-day life 
is generally measured by due dates, deadlines, and 
"to-do" lists. Where some might rip a page off a calendar, 
I remove a post-it note from a constantly expanding 
swamp of reminders, push pins, and reading lists that 
have found their way onto my bulletin board.
However, it wasnt long ago that I lived very differently. 
Rather than deadlines, my days were often tracked with 
tally marks and numerals scrawled along the inside 
of a foreign map. Rather than a dorm room, my home 
often amounted to a jumbled collection of vinyl bus 
seats and patches of floor carefully contained within the 
circumference of my mosquito net.
These were my experiences during the eight months 
I lived in Southeast Asia  eight months of mosquito 
repellent, cinched backpacks, and unpaved road. My 
clothes were sun-bleached and stretched, my shoes 
caked with the dirt of five countries and literally falling 
apart at the seams. And, when I reached the end of the 
eight months, heading home seemed a bit of a foreign 
concept. But leaving 
Southeast Asia 
didnt
nongovernment organizations, I worked to bring the arts 
into the healing process, offering an outlet for emotional 
stress while also encouraging physical recuperation 
through drawing and painting. I also worked with a 
group of children who had been orphaned or separated 
from their families due to violence and, with them, I 
created art and mural projects. These were just small 
acts  miniscule, really, in terms of the help I was able 
to offer to a group of people so desperately in need but 
ignored by much of the world. I didnt feel like I was 
doing much  maybe offering a distraction, a comfort 
here and there. It was defeating, to say the least. But as 
the weeks went by, I began to realize that the results of 
my actions were not always as necessary as my sheer 
presence was.
So I kept doing what I could, and as I did, my community 
quickly became much more than a statistic or a target 
group; instead they ended up becoming my family in 
the truest sense of the word. I ate alongside them, slept 
across the wooden slatted floors of their huts. In the 
evening when, with no electricity, it was too dark to see, 
we would sit around makeshift candles and talk late into 
the night. This was the time when I heard their stories
 in the evening after darkness had been pulled across 
the village like a shroud. Sometimes these were stories 
of terror: stories of running from the junta, of hiding 
within hollowed-out walls. But there were also stories of 
restoration and healing: stories of reconnecting with lost 
family, of finding new hope in a new country.
only amount to struggling with packing and good-byes; 
it also meant struggling with a collection of stories that 
seemed much too big to fit in my suitcase.
For the majority of the eight months I spent on the 
border between Thailand and Burma, I lived in a rural 
community of refugees who had been displaced by 
. Burmas government-sanctioned attacks on ethnic 
minority groups. These were individuals who had fled 
their homes and villages, leaving everything they owned 
and all they knew to escape to Thailand. Unfortunately, 
safety comes with its own set of problems for Burmese 
refugees: Namely, they have no rights to health care, 
education, or employment within Thailand. Transitioning 
into Thai society also poses a challenge because 
in addition to language and cultural barriers, many 
refugees left Burma severely disabled, often mentally 
traumatized or physically injured.
Many of the people I met had been traumatized to the 
point where they could no
longer function in a 
normal society.

Congratulations proves unimpressive FBBfl Paperhouse
MGMTs sophomore album is enjoyable, but relatively predictable lii'mJIliyi On The Black Keys
For those loyal MGMT fans out there, you are in for 
a mellow ride. Congratulations, MGMTs sophomore 
album, is filled with songs I would be likely to hear if
I were strolling through a haunted graveyard (if there 
were music) or living in the Beatles "Lucy in the 
Sky With Diamonds music video. This mixed bag of 
ambient and possibly drug-influenced songs is still 
fun to listen to and will bring a sense of nostalgia to 
listeners who also happen to be fans of Pink Floyd or 
other psychedelic rock groups.
On a positive note, the newest nine-track album 
from this budding group sounds well-coordinated 
and fluid; each song complements the next. The 
smooth and low-key vocals combined with muted 
drums and indie rhythms makes each song perfect 
for lounging around in ones pajamas on a Sunday.
On a more scandalous note, one can also imagine 
thse songs as a soundtrack to an acid trip. The 
complex guitar notes are pleasant to listen to, while 
the added-in electro-pop sounds make each song 
seem like it is constantly evolving. In fact, one 
12-minute song in particular, "Siberian Breaks, does 
just that. Each segment of the song contains a story 
with confusing lyrics and a distinct beat to match. If 
one listens to the album in one sitting, as I did, one 
will not be able to tell where one song ends and the 
next begins.
One thing about Congratulations that may confuse 
listeners is the lyrics. Someones Missing describes 
a person who has gone astray in a very sorrowful 
yet imaginative way. The album title song at first 
evokes the air of a slow, sappy love song, until one 
listens closer and realizes the song is complaining 
about government officials and then deciding to be 
apathetic. The song isnt happy at all, but rather 
mocking, deftly explained by I save my grace with 
half-assed guilt/And lay down the quilt upon the 
lawn/Spread my arms and soak up congratulations."
Even with the cynical and questioning undertones 
towards everyday life, the songwriting combined 
with complex sounds puts Congratulations ahead 
of the mainstream pack, both in terms of talent and 
plain old intrigue.
A great song on the album is Flash Delirium,
-one of the more upbeat songs of the bunch.
While the reason for the bands popularity may be 
indescribable, the beat and melody are head-rocking 
and the chaotic lyrics make the song that much 
more interesting.
Overall, these types of songs are generally not 
everyones cup of tea, but the refreshing new sounds 
and lyrics keep the true listeners on their toes. For 
bigger fans of MGMT, these songs will still be a 
hit or miss, and definitely a big change from their 
previous upbeat and faster-paced albums. While 
their previous tracks, released on the groups first 
album Oracular Spectacular, are quite different 
from their newest beats, it is clear that MGMT has 
matured both technically and culturally with the 
creation of this newest album.

MGMT perform live at La Route De Rock in 2008.
Comparisons to The White Stripes may be fair, but The 
Black Keys are their own act. To be entirely honest, hearing 
Strange Times by The Black Keys made Conquest by The 
White Stripes sound gimmicky, lihe burn of Dan Auerbacks 
guitar made Jack White sound like a sellout who gave up on 
garage rock.
Without a doubt, The Black Keys commanded the Carnival 
stage and caused a one-night Carnegie Mellon campus 
frenzy. Heavy on the attack and somber on the release, 
Auerback played his guitar with a slow and unrelenting burn 
that exchanged heavy rock riffs for solemn blues melodies. 
All the while, Patrick Carney beat his heart out on the drums. 
The two-man act gave a performance that could only be 
described as absolutely enthralling.
Of course, the show started low on energy; Carnegie Mellon 
tends to bring the most lethargic crowds. But 15 minutes into 
their set, The Black Keys had people jumping and kicking 
with excitement. 'The energy was amorphous and ecstatic; 
it came out of nowhere. The Black Keys might have given 
Carnegie Mellon its first genuine mosh pit.
Last year, the crowd didnt chant for The New Pornographers 
to give an encore, but this year the crowd didnt give The 
Black Keys an option. With the words One more song! 
echoing through Wiegand Gym, leaving the stage must have 
seemed impossible for Auerback and Carney. Personally, I 
wished the night could have lasted three days longer.

A modern take on a Shakespearean history
The School of Drama sucessfully translates the toils of Richard III into a contemporary setting
The School of Dramas production of William 
Shakespeares Richard HI was not what youd have 
expected. In fact, its use of technology and its 
modernized take on the play marked it as a unique and 
interesting performance, both full of energy and relevant 
to modern audiences.
The production, which opened on April 15 at the 
Chosky Theater, attempted to put a modern twist on a 
Shakespeare classic. Richard (played by drama fifth-year 
senior Gabriel King) was the villain of the play, who killed 
most of the people around him to win the throne. At the 
beginning, Richard used a video camera to shoot videos 
of himself, which were displayed on a television monitor 
nearby.
We first saw Richard at the opening of the play, filming 
his speech and divulging his plan to become the villain 
of the tale, as he was ugly and deformed, and could not 
be the lover. The soldiers around him were reminiscent 
of a SWAT team or riot police, complete with riot masks 
and long, black sticks in place of guns or swords.
By the opening of the play, Richard had already killed 
two people, and was plotting the imprisonment and 
execution of his brother George (drama senior Alborz 
Ghandehari), while pretending it was their brother King 
Edward IV (drama senior Skyler Scott) who wanted 
George dead.
Besides the throne, Richard also desired Lady Anne 
(drama senior Bekie Berkman-Rivera), whose husband 
and father he had killed. He tried to seduce her as she 
grieved over the red coffin of her husband, which was 
eventually carried out of the theater by the soldiers.
As the play went on, more television monitors were 
brought to the stage. After Edward died of natural 
causes and not by Richards hand, the funeral march was 
shown on the screens.
Richard decided to take the lives of Edwards two young 
sons (Peter Foster and Larry McKay) in order to avoid 
losing the throne, which he gained by having Lord 
Buckingham (drama senior Chase Newell) suggest that 
the boys were illegitimate following Edwards death.
Perhaps one of the most powerful scenes of the 
performance occurred near the end. The stage was 
mostly dark, except for an eerie projection of light. 
Soldiers slept on the ground the night before the battle 
in which Richard would die. The ghosts of the people 
Richard killed returned, speaking to him, all in white 
except for where the red spots from the blood of their 
violent deaths stained their clothing. The two young 
boys Richard killed provided the backdrop for the scene, 
with one playing piano and the other singing until they, 
too, haunted their murderous uncle.
The play was well done, performed with a modern feel 
that brought the events of the power struggle between 
the houses of York and Lancaster in the 15th century into 
the 21st century using multimedia and technology.
In the program for the show, it was explained that the 
play as performed by the School of Drama was meant to 
reflect the fact that these struggles still happen today. It 
stated: Violent transitions of power between opposing 
political forces, the cultural and religious implications 
of world military conflicts, the challenges faced by 
physically and psychologically damaged veterans, and 
the cynicism that accompanies the promise of a new 
leader are all too familiar to the American public.
The last paragraph of the program section titled 
Shakespeare, Our Contemporary stated, Our 
heightened, modern reflection of Richard HI explores 
how a contemporary Shakespeare production can 
question, subvert, and reframe both the past and the 
present at once..
If this was the goal of the production, it can certainly be 
considered a success. The ties between the past and the

present were very clear, especially given the riot gear 
that the army soldiers wore. In light of recent events, 
this outerwear symbolized tyranny and an unjust use of 
power, something that resonated for the characters in 
the play as well.
The set was minimal. It consisted largely of a throne 
that could be lowered from the ceiling as needed and 
several coffins, which rarely gave the characters much 
of a backdrop, but not to the detriment to the play. It 
allowed the audience to focus on what this performance 
was about  the events and characters. The lack of 
a traditional set also allowed the events to seamlessly 
transition from those in the play to those in the world. 
With a set denoting an era, the events and meaning 
would be firmly grounded in time, rather than spanning 
the centuries as they did in this version  a good choice 
for this performance.
Costumes were also fitting, though confusing at times. 
Some characters seemed to come out of past times, 
while others dressed for today. The military costumes 
were appropriate and created a powerful image. The 
white-clad ghosts were also powerful, standing out from 
the darkly dressed soldiers around them.
The actors put on strong performances of their 
characters. King was especially good as Richard, using 
the lines to show both Richards ruthlessness and villainy 
and to show his insanity. Margaret, the former queen 
of England (drama senior Daisy Hobbs), was also an 
interesting and well-played character. With her former 
power gone, Margaret was unable to walk or stand and 
was exiled from the kingdom. She returned to speak 
with some of the characters, though, and Hobbs did an 
excellent job of showing the woman's despair.
Each aspect of the show, from the acting to the set 
and the costumes to the use of media and technology, 
contributed to its success.
Richard HI will run through Saturday at the Philip Chosky 
Theater in the Purnell Center. There will be a talkback 
session with the shows dramaturg, Corinna Archer, 
Tuesday following the show. For more information or

Adichie explores a chaotic time for Nigeria
A story of violence and the stresses of war, Half of a Yellow Sun is an eye-opening read
On July 6, 1967, Nigeria was officially torn apart by 
civil war. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies book Half of a 
Yellow Sun retells the horrific pain, fear, and violence 
of the Nigerian-Biafran War through the eyes of three 
unique protagonists: a servant boy Ugwu, his masters 
rich and beautiful girlfriend Olanna, and an Englishman 
named Richard. Each character offers his or her own 
perspective on the troubled times, depicting the anguish 
experienced by Nigerians during the war.
Carved arbitrarily out of western Africa by the British 
colonial empire, Nigeria was made up of diverse African 
tribes that began to fight for control of the country after 
the British left. Democracy crumbled when two of the 
main tribes, the Hausa and the Igbo, opened war on 
each other. In an attempt to declare their independence, 
the Igbo created Biafra, a new country in the south.
Being Igbo, Olanna, her lover Odenigbo, their baby, and 
Ugwu are forced to flee their home and migrate to Biafra. 
Their journey to find safety in a volatile country with 
no real shelter, few friends, no food, and no knowledge
of when the suffering is going to end is horrifyingly 
moving.
Adichie divides the narrative between the three main 
characters and plays with the timeline of the plot. Her 
move of tampering with the order in which readers hear 
the story is one that she had employed successfully in 
her first book, Purple Hibiscus, as well. Bypassing the 
interim years allows Adichie to surprise the readers 
with questions  Olanna now has a baby; when was 
the baby born? Richard and Odenigbo have had a 
falling out; why did that happen?  questions that are 
only answered when she returns to tell the tales of the 
missing years.
Through the character of Ugwu, Adichie is able to 
communicate how harsh environments shape people 
for the worse, making them capable of performing acts 
they never thought they could. Readers witness Ugwu 
as an innocent boy growing up in Odenigbos house. 
Then, after the war, Olanna desperately tries to keep 
Ugwu from being forced to enlist in the army, but his
recruitment is inevitable. Army life makes Ugwu a 
changed man. A major turning point in Ugwus life, and 
one that starkly depicts the lack of moral values during 
times of war, is when Ugwu joins his army buddies in 
gang-raping a woman. The description of the event 
stains the innocent image of Ugwus past  leaving a 
broken, unfamiliar one in its place.
Even with the broader acts of war taking place 
throughout the book, Adichie is able to focus on the 
strong personal relationships between the characters: 
the love-hate relationship between Olanna and her 
twin sister Kainene, Richard and Kainene's unexpected 
love for one another, and the fracturing and healing of 
Olanna and Odenigbos bond. Adichie has a wonderfully 
simple and clear style of writing that lets the strength ' 
of her story speak for itself, allowing readers to be truly 
impacted by not just the bare facts of history, but also 
the torn and lost lives of her characters entangled in it.

We kick off James Cameron week 
here at Carnegie Mellon with Aliens 
of the Deep, a 2005 documentary 
that saw Cameron team up with 
NASA scientists to help produce his 
only film between Titanic and Avatar. 
Cameron and the scientists use 
state-of-the-art technology to explore 
the Mid-Ocean Ridge, an underwater 
chain of mountains that are home to 
some of this planets most curious 
species of life, including creatures 
that do not require sunlight to survive. 
Freaky, huh? The documentary 
showcases Camerons passion 
for underwater exploration and his 
interest in exotic life, both major 
themes in many of his movies.

The theater is sure to be packed this 
day as the highest-grossing movie ever 
(without inflation), Avatar, premieres 
at McConomy. Even though ticket 
sales suggest that everyone and 
their mother has seen the film twice,
Ill give a brief overview. A bunch of 
semi-known actors and Sigourney 
Weaver are living and working on 
the world Pandora trying to mine 
unobtanium while not trying to annoy 
the Navi, the native species. The 
movie is a visual masterpiece with

Is there any better way to follow up 
the sci-fi spectacle that is Avatar than 
with one of the greatest sci-fi stories 
ever written? Arnold Schwarzenegger 
stars as the titular character in this 
1984 classic about a cyborg sent 
back in time to kill the mother of the 
man who leads a resistance against 
sentient machines. We follow Sarah 
Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese 
(Michael Biehn) as they are relentlessly 
stalked by the Terminator, who will stop 
at absolutely nothing to assassinate 
Sarah. Fun fact: Its hard to believe that 
the original film in one of the greatest 
movie franchises of all time was made 
for a scant $6.5 million.

The Abyss sees James Cameron 
bringing back Michael Bieh, and

excellent adventure flick about what 
lies deep beneath the ocean. The 
story follows a civilian oil drilling 
team as they get involved in a 
search-and-rescue mission following 
the sinking of a U.S. submarine that 
encountered an unidentified life form. 
Fun fact: It took 7 million gallons of 
water to construct the massive set 
where most of the movie was filmed. 
In fact, the cast spent so much time 
underwater that they sometimes had 
to go through decompression to get 
used to the varying depths.

Organic ingredients are not only tasty and beneficial 
for your body, they're also good for our environment.
Artichoke Risotto (Serves six)
Ingredients: 4 cups organic vegetable stock; 2 
tablespoons vegetable oil; % cup minced shallots; V2 cup 
finely diced yellow onion; 2 minced garlic cloves; 1 cup 
Arborio rice; V2 artichoke heart, quartered; 1 tablespoon 
finely chopped fresh sage; % cup white wine; V2 teaspoon 
salt; pinch of ground black pepper; % cup shredded

Directions: On low heat, warm the vegetable stock and 
set it aside. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan 
over medium-low heat and add the garlic, shallots, and 
onion. Cook until the shallots and onions are translucent. 
It should take about three minutes. Then add the rice and 
stir well before cooking for a minute.
Add the sage, white wine, artichoke heart, salt, and 
pepper, and cook until the wine is absorbed by the rice. 
Add the stock one cup at a time while stirring. Stir until 
the rice absorbs all of the liquid, which should take 15

peel. Alternately add in the flour and milk (divide into 
about three portions) and beat until the batter is smooth. 
Mix in the blueberries and pour into the loaf pan. Bake 
for 60-70 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center 
comes out clean and the top is golden. In the meantime, 
prepare the syrup that will go on top by combining the 
lemon juice and granulated sugar in a microwave-safe 
bowl. Microwave for 3045 seconds until the mixture 
begins to boil, and stir. Poke holes in the top of the loaf 
and pour the syrup over the top to ensure that the loaf 
absorbs it. Let it sit for 30 minutes before serving.

CMU, I Love You showcases student directors
Students put together an impressive selection of films for a memorable Carnival experience
As the minutes dragged on, the anticipation built for the 
much-talked-about collaborative film CMU, I Love You, a 
film made by Carnegie Mellon students and put together 
by the CMU Filmmaking Club. The idea was similar to 
that of the recent films New York, I Love You and Paris, 
je taime, which are collections of short clips about love 
that take place in each respective city. CMU, I Love You 
featured 13 short clips about such interpretations of love 
in and around campus. The stories ranged from abstract 
ideas to cliched love stories.
The film started off with Chemist" by master's student 
James Wong, which shows moments of different people's 
lives as they experience love or the lack thereof. The 
short film is done with voiceover, sometimes presented 
in dialogue and other times as thoughts inside peoples 
heads. One memorable, touching scene was of a girl wait
ing to meet a guy at a bus stop, but the guy never showed 
and she eventually left.
One of the more notable skits was Books" by sophomore 
art major Benjamin Welmond, which took place in an 
imagined Hunt Library where books move off shelves
without the help of students. Cleverly animated, the main 
characters are two male illustrations that literally come off 
the pages of a book and happen to spot a photograph of a 
highly attractive woman in a book. However, as a student 
opens the door, the books hurriedly rush back to their 
proper places. The student takes the book containing the 
woman and leaves.
Yes, No, Maybe by junior drama major Kendra Chapman 
is a bittersweet story about taking chances. A girl walks 
into a study lounge where a guy is akeady studying. He is 
obviously interested in her, while she hardly notices him. 
When she walks away, he writes a note asking her out 
with the options yes, no, and maybe on it, and slips 
it into her book. She soon comes back with another guy 
who she is obviously interested in. The original guy looks 
crushed and leaves after she discovers the note.
Another scene, titled Love Rendered, by senior business 
and social and decision sciences double major Megan 
Larcom (and the Love Rendering Crew) questions various 
people around campus about their passion for their field. 
People interviewed include Carnegie Mellon President
Jared Cohon. Some of the questions are serious and 
directed towards their love of their studies, while others 
are funny and silly, like their opinions on the possible 
future creation of a love simulator.
Tale of Two Majors by sophomore general H&SS major 
Connor Fallon and junior humanities and art major 
William Pettiiohn Hernandez was a crowd favorite and is 
based on the funny stereotypes of drama and computer 
science majors. It features a Romeo and Juliet-type love 
story between a female drama student and a male 
Computer science student. Their friends are concerned 
about their respective choice in partner and how their 
love affects their school work. To deal with the criticisms, 
the couple decides to change majors.
Every scene of this film was worth watching, and it 
was remarkable to see the efforts of our fellow students 
displayed on the big screen. Lets hope that this exciting 
Carnival event will become an annual Midway tradition.

Michael and Michael bring comedy to Carnival
Hilarious duo share their knowlege of Carnegie Mellon and cause big laughs at Midway
Thursday night, students rushed to fill seats under the 
main stage tent at Midway. Once every seat was taken, 
those in the crowd unable to find a folding chair lined the 
edges of the tent to peer at the stage. Munching on fried 
Oreos and clumps of funnel cake, the audience settled 
into their seats and poised their cell phone cameras in 
preparation for the appearance of Michael Ian Black and 
Michael Showaiter and their comedy act.
Surprisingly, a fair amount of education came before 
the laughs. Black and Showalter entered the stage amid 
cheers, and began imparting their vast knowledge about 
the history of Carnegie Mellon. You know, the original 
name was Andrew Carnegies Honeydew Mellon, one of 
the comedians informed the crowd.
Aside from their knowledge of the agricultural roots of 
our university, they seemed to have done their research 
on the traditions of Carnival as well. Black shared his 
ideas for a booth theme. Trench warfare, the Irish Potato 
Famine... what would you do in your booth? Starve? he 
asked.
Blacks definition of Buggy was short, sweet, and far 
clearer than that of many Carnegie Mellon students 
themselves. With a deadpan face he said, simply: Buggy 
is: You build a buggy, you race it, you win.
They also shared a little-explored perspective on the 
gender relations behind Buggy. This has to be the most
misogynistic sport. Ever, Black sighed and said. You 
put a girl in a buggy and shove it down a hill.
Early on in the show, Black revealed that he was a reader 
of The Tartan, which he accused of being both severely 
unfunny and the most intelligent paper he has ever 
read. Backhanded compliments aside, Showalter had a 
personal experience concerning the paper to share: I 
get Tartan on my teeth sometimes."
The act soon turned away from Carnegie Mellon themes 
to disappointing Halloween costumes, holiday reindeer 
sweaters, and games of Jeopardy! and Scrabble. Several 
awkward topics led to equally awkward silences and 
nervous chuckles from the audience, but for the most 
part, the comedians' humor seemed to hit its mark.
Black and Showalter's unique style of comedy seems to 
have a selective fan base: Either you got it and laughed 
your head off or you sat in confused silence. Judging 
from the noise level of the laughter throughout the show, 
those who found the pair hilarious made up most of the 
audience. Many of those present were fans of their show 
on Comedy Central and Stella, as well as Blacks work in 
VH1 s I Love The... series.
However, audience members not so well-acquainted 
with their style of humor were not so impressed. I think 
it was too forced.... They took jokes too far that shouldve 
stopped a long time ago," first-year professional writing
major Jordan Stephenson said with a shrug. It was 
really funny at times, though.
Though Black and Showalter may not have found a new 
fan in every member of the audience, by request of the 
crowd they continued their act past its closing time by 
improvising dramatic movie scenes to random songs on 
Showalters iTunes album. The show ended, as it began, 
on the subject of Carnival.
- Go, Roy!" Black yelled to his non-existent, waterpainting rebel of a son. "Take your beat-up ol pickup, 
and dont you ever come back! Carnegie Mellon, he 
yelled, amid cheers from the audience, "Go! Go enjoy 
your Carnival, and never, ever, ever come back!

Carnival concession booth remains a hit
The members of Alpha Phi Omega once again provide Midway visitors with delicious treats
Chalita Maneetham | Photo Staff
Members of Alpha Phi Omega work hard at the boilers and grills to provide food for Carnival.
Friday, the Alpha Phi Omega booth opened for business 
as well.
The roof of the Alpha Phi Omega booth experienced a 
few rain leaks this year because of tears in the tar paper 
on the roof. The electronics, ranging from a huge stand 
mixer to deep fryers and grills, were safe. The brothers 
were able to quickly fix the leaks in the rooftop. By 
last Saturday, the booth was once again ready for the 
afternoon forecast.
While funnel cakes and fried Oreos are Carnival classics, 
the booth also featured some unconventional Carnival 
treats. Along with pretzels and drinks, Alpha Phi Omega 
prepared ice cream because of its popularity from last 
year, but the Pittsburgh weather was not too considerate 
of the investment. Hamburgers and cheeseburgers were 
new to this years Carnival. Pizza, however, was taken off 
the Carnival menu.
The planning of next years Carnival starts right after this 
years celebration ends. For Carnival 2011, the Carnival 
Committee will meet together to decide the menu. 
Xiaojing Zhu, a senior in business administration and 
the purchasing chair of Carnival 2010, explained that the 
committee goes over what food worked and what food 
didnt work. The committee then decides what changes 
should be made. Early in the spring, next years menu is 
finalized.
As for the booth design, Alpha Phi Omega always tries 
to make the construction as simple as possible, making 
the booth easy to set up and tear down. Every year, the 
booth is made ready for rain or snow, and the roof is
lined with tar paper to prevent leaking.
This year, Alpha Phi Omega started to build the booth 
after Move-On and finished the construction in one day. 
The simple design made everything straightforward for 
the team. Even with some modification, most people 
knew the general construction of the concession stand.
On Wednesday, Alpha Phi Omega rented a U-Haul truck 
to transport food from various stores to the booth. With 
multiple refrigerators, the members of Alpha Phi Omega 
could store their food in their booth.
For each day of Carnival, Alpha Phi Omega started setup 
two hours before Midway opened. During the early 
morning, while the majority of the campus was watching 
Buggy, Alpha Phi Omega started to warm up the oil for 
funnel cake, the boiling water for hot dogs, and the grills 
for the hamburgers and cheeseburgers.
As the days went by, the number of staff members varied 
depending on the expected consumer traffic. This year, 
the booth doors really came to good use by keeping heat 
from the ovens and fryers confined to the booth.
Unlike the other booths, the Alpha Phi Omega 
concession stand needed a full staff to run. However, the 
members hard work did not go unrewarded. For Alpha 
Phi Omega, money raised during Carnival is the major 
source of funding for the groups yearly service project. 
For those participating, Carnival is cooking, eating, and 
raising money, all at the same time.

Once upon a time, sweet dough was poured into a pan 
of hot oil, fried, and sprinkled with sugar on top  and 
dessert history was made. Ever since then, students 
have been drizzling batter and frying the same treats to 
satisfy the entire Carnegie Mellon community.
Its fried, its sweet, and its not even breakfast.
Although it could be breakfast. It doesnt matter what 
time it is, breakfast is the first meal of the day. At 
Carnegie Mellon, we eat timely. We fetch a La Prima 
coffee and croissant at 11:32 a.m. while running late for 
class, grab an Asiana bowl at 4 p.m. for lunch, and then 
order Little Nippers Pizza at 10 p.m. For Carnival-goers 
this weekend, Midway treats were a delicious addition 
to our usual meal plan.
Whatever your college-eating philosophy is, we can all 
agree on one thing  mid-April is the time for funnel 
cake and fried Oreos. Funnel cake  pale or deep gold in 
color, depending on who makes it  lures everyone who 
walks onto Midway. Even if you dont see the Alpha Phi 
Omega booth, you can smell that delicious scent in the 
air. Around every corner are Carnival-goers eating fried 
treats, and you can be sure that they intend to finish 
them.
Funnel cakes and fried Oreos are full of psychological 
health benefits. The fried carbohydrates call to you, 
dusted sweetly with powdered sugar. After a while, the 
steam turns the powder into delicious sugary clumps 
that really stick to the dough. These typical Carnival 
treats are delicious Carnival usuals.
Regardless of the weather, the Alpha Phi Omega booth 
will always stand. Alpha Phi Omega is a national service 
fraternity that organizes fundraising events throughout 
the year. With the Carnival opening ceremony last

Funnel cake has and always will be a classic and

The Black Keys and mewithoutYou rule the stage
Despite poor weather, Activities Board once again produces a top-notch Carnival concert
Over the years, Carnegie Mellon's Carnival has hosted 
a plethora of big names. From The Shins in 2005 to 
last years rave-review performance by The New 
Pornographers, when it comes to the Carnival concert, 
the Carnegie Mellon Activities Board never fails to 
deliver. This year was certainly no exception when 
AB brought mewithoutYou and The Black Keys to. our 
campus.
Although the location of the concert was moved from 
the CFA Lawn to Wiegand Gym due to impending rain, 
the Carnival concert crowd was by no means lacking 
energy. With 250 last-minute tickets being handed out 
to concertgoers, Wiegand quickly filled with eager fans. 
The audience, however, was not limited to Carnegie 
Mellon students  several outsiders, whether they were 
students from nearby schools or just local fans, rushed to 
find their means of admittance.
When it was time for the opening band, mewithoutYou, 
to take the stage, the crowd had grown somewhat 
impatient, chanting "Let them play! until the very 
second the lights dimmed. With that change of lighting, 
however, came a roar of excitement so strong that one 
could have mistaken Wiegand Gym for Heinz Hall.
Philadelphia natives Aaron and Michael Weiss formed 
what would soon become mewithoutYou in the late '90s,
and since then, the band has enjoyed a consistent run 
of popularity. Having released two EPs and four albums, 
and having graced the bills of several big-name music 
festivals, the members of mewithoutYou are no strangers 
to the spotlight.
Soon after taking the stage here at Carnegie Mellon, the 
guys of mewithoutYou began a flawless set with classic 
tracks from their earlier albums as well as some newer 
tunes. The band sent the Carnegie Mellon crowd into 
chaos  crowd surfers began exploding from the sea of 
listeners toward the middle of the crowd. This started 
what can be considered the closest Carnegie Mellon will 
ever get to having a mosh pit.
After mewithoutYou came the highly anticipated 
headliners, The Black Keys. Though any fan of the 
band would know, this tiny two-person group is often 
praised for its huge sound. This effect, however, is so 
much greater when seeing the band perform live  its 
incredible to imagine such a large sound coming from 
only two men.
Much like the members of mewithoutYou, Dan Auerbach 
and Partick Carney of The Black Keys have enjoyed 
a long run with fame. Having released a total of eight 
albums, including their most recent 2010 release 
Brothers, the band not only performed its newer songs,
but also those popular classics like "Strange Desire from 
earlier releases.
Overall, the Carnival concert was yet again a huge 
success for both the coordinators of the AB Concerts 
committee and the Carnegie Mellon community. With 
the reputation of our spring Carnival concert exceeding 
itself each year, we can only hope for further amazing 
concerts in the future.

Carnival side concerts bring community together
Student bands prove to be anything but bland during their various Midway performances
For this years Spring Carnival, many students and alumni 
geared up for the Black Keys concert on Friday night in 
Wiegand Gym. Although this was the main advertised 
musical event, the side stage student-run concerts were 
hugely successful and deserved more buzz than just the 
casual Facebook invite. Usually, listeners have to grin and 
bear it when they attend their friends bands concert or 
amateur musical event and praise them no matter the 
quality of their performance. This, however, was not the 
case with the performers at this years Carnival side stage 
performances.
Last Thursday, in the Kraus Campo connecting CFA to 
Tepper, student band Monsters! performed for the CFA 
Beaux Arts Ball, an underground party in celebration of 
Carnival, and recruited quite an audience. This band 
consists of Alex Weston, a junior music major, on piano 
and vocals; Andrew Harrison, also a junior music major, 
on trumpet; Terence Einhorn, a sophomore social and 
decision science major, on saxophone; Zack Armentrout, 
a junior mathematical science major, on the drums; and 
postdoctoral fellow Dave Conner on bass.
The music played was perfect for the atmosphere, and 
the musical talent brought forward by our peers was 
incredible. What is great about Monsters! is the sax and 
trumpet, which bring individuality and jazz tonality to 
the music and make the group stand out among other 
student bands. The music played live at the CFA Beaux 
Arts Ball really kicked off the party right. The live music, 
quirky DJs, and favorable weather made partygoers want 
to stay out all night and forget about school re-starting 
soon after the weekend.
Last Saturday, in the Midway side tent, A Place in the 
Sun performed for a short while for all the Booth visitors 
and Carnival attendees. Although it ended up being a 
frigid day, students bundled up and trekked out to see 
their peers perform. The band is composed of Duquesne 
University students Darren Diederich on vocals and 
guitar, Derek Cavaliero on guitar, Matt Sonnega on 
the drums, and Carnegie Mellon senior electrical and 
chemical engineering major Warren Pryde on bass. The 
music was a nice addition to the Carnival atmosphere, 
and while sitting in the audience was a little cold, being
there to support fellow students was a great way to get 
into the Carnival mood.
After the A Place in the Sun performance, the Tim Ruff 
Trio played at the main Midway tent. Senior music major 
Tim Ruff performed with his band made up of sophomore 
social and decision science major Terence Einhorn on sax, 
junior social and decision science major Evan Haiikias 
on drums, and senior English major Nathan Zoob on lead 
guitar. The group managed to draw a crowd in the last 
hours of Friday evening.
Watching these student bands was a very inspiring 
experience for anyone who went. These students are 
using their talents to spread music and unite the campus 
community while simultaneously doing something that 
they are truly passionate about, and that is what Carnival 
is all about.

AEPi dominates in Carnival Mobot Races
With the majority of mobots failing to make it around the first gate, this year's competition had a clear winner

and were loudly cheered on, while others left the starting 
point at a snails pace. All the mobots completed the first 
gate, following the line almost exactly, but many couldnt 
handle the pressure when they began to descend the 
hill. The few who made it past the first hill managed 
to complete the majority of the course. Those who 
successfully stayed on track down the second hill had to 
struggle through a hodgepodge of crossing lines at the 
end of the course.
In the end, AEPis robot was this years undergraduate 
champion, passing through all 15 gates in a time of 
1:17.20. The robot,'created by first-year computer 
science major Nathanial Barshay, was able to travel in 
a smoother trajectory because it wasnt adjusting every 
single time it slightly deviated from the line. The winner 
of the open class section, Megubot, was created by 
C-MITES students Megan and Terry McKelvey. It used 
sensor arrays to control both acceleration and direction 
but couldnt get down the second hill.
Second place in the undergraduate category was team 
Zoidberg, made up of computer science junior Jake 
Poznanski and mathematical sciences junior Itai Stein. 
The robot completed eight gates with a time of 1:19.69.
In third place was Stingray, created by electrical and 
computer engineering sophomore Kwabena Walden 
Agyeman, also completing eight gates, but with a slower 
time of 1:41.95. Megubot won both the judges choice 
and also the open section, completing nine gates in 
2:27.44.
Mobot is a tradition that in many ways defines the 
interdisciplinary approach Carnegie Mellon strives 
towards. In the future; we can expect many more 
cardboard cyborgs, armed and kilted Scotsmen, 
and  most of all  clever and innovative robots.
Eliot Knudsen | Junior Staffwriter
No Carnival event showcases Carnegie Mellon's nerd 
pride more than the Mobot (mobile robot) Races. It is a 
festival of motherboards, switches, gears, and glasses, 
where brains reign supreme and hard work pays off.
The 16th annual Mobot Races were a great display of 
mechanical innovation and programming ingenuity.
The rules of Mobot are simple. Rain or shine, each 
robot must travel a 255-foot slalom course marked by a 
white line on the sidewalk in front of Wean Hall, passing 
through 15 gates in order along the way. The robot 
that reaches the farthest gate with the best time is the 
winner and receives a $1000 prize. The second-place 
winner receives $500, and the third-place winner 
receives $250. The majority of the robots were created 
by undergraduate students, and others competed in the 
exhibition and open sections.
The minutes leading up to the first race were tense. All 
the teams were making final adjustments: checking to 
see if their robots actually followed the line, detaching 
and reattaching wires to various circuit boards, and 
walking their robots purposefully down the hill with 
laptops in hand. There were groans, and even a yelp 
from the team cautiously sticking a screwdriver into a 
mess of wires. And as the wind picked up, the race was 
ready to begin.
Of course, as at many Carnegie Mellon events, there 
were a few curious participants. Greg Armstrong, a 
senior research technician in the Robotics Institute, 
came out of Wean Hall in a plaid kilt and toga, wielding

an enormous sword. During the races, he strolled up 
the walkway, glancing at each mobot, waving his 
sword in the air, and every so often shouting things like 
"Those aren't Legos! and Get your mobots ready!
In the background, Red Robot, the Robotics Clubs 
human-sized robot mascot, wandered the field playing 
Daft Punks "Technologic and dancing with children 
and students. A couple of people on pogo-stilts walked 
by nonchalantly.
The area surrounding the pit stop where the mobots 
were being adjusted began to fill up with fans, all eager 
to see exactly what sort of bizarre machines would be at 
the event this year. The crowd was made up of students, 
children, alumni, and professors.
There are many different approaches to completing the 
Mobot course. Almost all involve following the thin white 
line that winds through the gates and down the hill.
The robots usually use a sensor array attached to their 
undersides to direct their steering, while an independent 
motor pushes them forward. Once the mobots go off 
track, their chances of coming back are slim to none.
The record for the course is an astounding 33.99 
seconds, or 7.5 feet per second, set by two Carnegie 
Mellon robotics staff members, Michael Licitra and Jeff 
McMahill, in 2009.
This year, there were several different interesting 
constructions. One mobot, named Jiggyfly, was made 
with a few sheets of looseleaf paper, a block of wood, 
and a hacked Game Boy. Another, named Stingray, was 
a triangle with a few wheels sticking out, completely 
covered in black duct tape. And finally, Alpha Epsilon 
Pis robot used a camera and a netbook and seemed to 
track the line in front of it and adjust its path that way.
Each of the 15 robots was placed at the starting points, 
switched on, and let run. Some began extremely quickly

Carnival booths exceed public expectations
This year, Midway displayed an especially Impressive selection of student achievement
T by Akanksha Vaidya | Contributing Editor J
This year, Carnival once again boasted the usual 
elaborately designed booths and, as a result, Midway 
showcased some of Carnegie Mellon's most creative 
work. With booth designs ranging from a never-ending 
ice age to a world in which the Pittsburgh Pirates 
actually win games, the booths aptly reflected this years 
theme  History With A Twist."
In spite of some setbacks due to rain showers on Friday 
and cold weather all Saturday, Midway still attracted 
a throng of students, faculty, and other Pittsburghers. 
Judging took place on Friday, and the winners were 
announced at the awards ceremony on Saturday 
afternoon.
In the fraternity category, Phi Kappa Theta's booth, 
"RoboRome, took first place. The members of Phi Kappa 
Theta had clearly paid attention to detail while building 
the booth, as the entire exterior was covered in small,
carefully placed mirrors. Phi Kappa Theta also earned the 
Chairman's Choice Award.
Sigma Phi Epsilon's If The Y2K Happened" won the 
second prize for fraternities. With its life-size circuit 
boards and giant Gmail chat lists displaying the names 
of the fraternity members, this extremely Carnegie 
Mellon-esque booth dazzled viewers with its every 
aspect. The booth also sported a mock Facebook profile 
page that displayed visitors' pictures where the profile 
picture usually appears. With something interesting 
on every wall, this Y2K booth was both witty and well 
designed.
Alpha Epsilon Pis Pittsburgh Wins the World Series" 
won the third prize. This booth was a parody of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, including a Hall of Fame for the 
Pirates with a golden cup and glove. The booth also 
included a spectacularly fun baseball game, complete 
with scoreboard and an enthusiastic digital audience. 
This theme was clearly a favorite with Pittsburghers and
earned many laughs.
In the sorority category, Kappa Alpha Thetas Hanging 
Gardens of Babylon earned first place. Perhaps 
the most remarkable aspect of this booth was the 
three-story-tall waterfall that spanned most of the 
exterior. The interior of the booth was filled with plants 
and beautifully constructed pillars, lending the booth a 
sense of mystery that made it extremely popular with the 
crowd. It won the Peoples Choice Award.
Kappa Kappa Gammas If the Ice Age Never Ended 
won second place in the sorority category. The booth 
showcased pictures of everyday scenes and famous 
places modified to reflect a perpetual ice age, and it 
was a great display of innovation and wit. One of the 
most notable of these pictures was that of the Egyptian 
Sphinx, which the girls of Kappa Kappa Gamma made of 
ice instead of sand.
The third-place prize went to Alpha Chi Omegas

Agrabah-themed booth. The large golden domes of the 
booth made it extremely noticeable and helped attract a 
large crowd. Inside the booth was an Agrabah market, 
complete with fake swords, heaps of watermelon, fake 
fish, and other goods that made this booth a treat for 
all. As Rebecca Jacobs, an'Alpha Chi Omega sister and 
sophomore psychology and Spanish major, put it, [The 
theme of our booth] is something that both kids and 
adults can enjoy.
Appealing to a large audience, the Taiwanese Student 
Association's (TSA) booth won first place in the 
independent category. Called An Adventure For Those 
Who Seek To Find A Way To Leave CMU Behind," the 
booth had the public navigate its way through a Jumanji 
game board. Johnson Pun, a sophomore architecture 
major and Booth co-chair for TSA, said that the group 
likes doing anything out of the ordinary," and this led 
the members to choose their theme. The booth was 
certainly unique, with intricately designed statues 
within the booth and a host of enormous jungle animals 
and insects crawling up the exterior of the booth.
TSA also won the Environmental Award, an award 
recognizing creative use of materials for building, use of 
environmentally friendly building materials, and the ease 
and safety of disposal of the booth.
The Asian Student Association (ASA) won second 
place in the independent category for SuperBooth: 
Marvel Warfare!" A tribute to some of the all-time most 
popular superheroes, this booth was a chapter straight
be killed by stomping on a touchscreen in the floor, and 
finally enter another chamber where the audience was 
detoxified by being shaken on a moving platform.
The entire concept of this booth, along with the 
electronics used, made it standout among all the other 
booths. Michael Campbell, a masters student in the ETC 
and co-producer of the ImininTech project, explained 
that after the ETC showcased Get In Line" during last 
years Carnival and received a favorable response, they 
decided to move on to something bigger. [We thought,] 
why dont we join in the fun and make a booth?" 
Campbell said. The team behind the project consisted 
of nine students and two faculty advisors. Campbell 
hoped that ETC would be able to continue this tradition 
and next year build something of a similar, if not better, 
caliber.
Although the final results were impressive, the initial 
process of building the booths was not without major 
obstacles. For Jacobs and her sorority, building the 
domes and columns [of the Agrabah booth] was a major 
challenge. For both Chow and Pun, the biggest difficulty 
was learning to cooperate as a group with such a large 
variety of people. As Pun said, [It was a challenge] 
making sure that everyone was happy with the end 
result. In the end, however, the groups managed to 
overcome these challenges and help make Carnival a 
success, as always.

out of the comic books. The painting done in the booth 
was especially astounding and adhered well to the 
overall theme of the booth. Donald Chow, a sophomore 
architecture major and one of the booth chairs for ASA, 
said that the group wanted the booth to "appeal to little 
kids and that was the "main focus" of the booth.
The third place in the independent category went to 
the Singapore Students Associations booth based on 
George Orwells book 1984.
The final category of awards was for the blitz booths. 
The first prize went to the Archibooth, titled .. .In a 
box. The second prize went to Mudge House's "Fishy 
Evolution," and the third prize went to Stever Houses

Although it was not a competitive booth, a booth worth 
mentioning is the Entertainment Technology Centers 
(ETC) The ImininTech Project. This was the first year 
that the ETC built a booth. Using up two booth spaces, 
The ImininTech Project" attracted a large amount of 
people, with the line to the booth snaking almost all 
the way across Midway. This booth was far different 
from the conventional ones, as it was designed to be an 
interactive experience that had the public participating 
all the way through. Five to seven people were let inside 
"ImininTech" at a time and were guided through the "lab

Excitement and surprise meet at Sweepstakes
Complications and disqualifications at this years competition cause shocking Buggy results

9.9 carnival

[
by Greg Hanneman | Copy Manager 
and Nikunja Kolluri | Managing Editor
Friday was the start of the 91st annual Sweepstakes 
competition, one of Carnegie Mellon's unique traditions. 
Sweepstakes  or Buggy, as it is more commonly known
 brings together both Greek houses and independent 
organizations in a combination of engineering and 
athleticism. Teams build small racing vehicles, known as 
buggies, that are pushed and driven around a 0.9-mile 
course between Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall and 
Schenley Park.
This years rolls were punctuated by numerous 
mechanical problems, logistical difficulties, and 
surprising disqualifications on both days. The final result 
after Saturdays finals had Fringe taking the top spot in 
both the mens and womens races.
Preliminary races
More than 50 teams took to the course during 
preliminary rounds Friday, a day marked by numerous 
mechanical problems and disqualifications. In total, 
eight teams failed to cross the finish line, and three were 
granted re-rolls after problems in their initial races.
Problems began early, as the womens heats saw two 
disqualifications and three spinouts. In the seventh 
heat, spinouts claimed both the SPIRIT C and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon (Sig Ep) A womens buggies, leaving Student
Dormitory Council (SDC) A to finish the race alone. 
SPIRIT in particular had a tough morning, as only one 
of the groups three womens teams crossed the finish 
line. The surviving A team finished eighth with a time of 
2:55.17. Overall, the groups buggies lost three wheels in 
various Friday heats.
Kory McDonald, SPIRIT Buggy chair and junior 
mechanical engineering major, explained that SPIRIT 
was working on new things and trying to push the limit 
this year. Unfortunately," he said, some things didnt 
come together in the end. What we saw in practice just 
didnt come through on race day.
"Its kind of sad, said Richard Halstead, a master's 
student in electrical and computer engineering who 
pushes for the CIA B mens team, because they usee? 
to be really competitive  and their teams still are, I 
think  but they seem to consistently screw up on the 
freeroll.
The CIA womens teams also suffered from logistical 
problems. The A team was disqualified for having an 
apparent pacer alongside the course. The B team did 
not complete its race when the team's flagger signaled 
driver and junior architecture major Annemarie Malbon 
to stop following the SPIRIT B crash. The team was 
granted a re-roll on Saturday and finished with a time of 
3:31.58.
I guess the womens heats did go pretty badly. Usually 
theres only one or two crashes per day, Halstead said.
The top of the womens leader board ended Friday 
with familiar faces. SDC, the first organization to field 
four womens teams, advanced all four of them into the 
top 10. SDC A took the top spot with a time of 2:28.14. 
Behind them, the Fringe A team cut nine seconds off 
its 2009 time to finish in second place at 2:39.49. SDC B, 
though the team lost some time from last year, rounded 
out the top three at 2:42.07. Also advancing to Saturdays 
final rounds were Fringe B at 2:48.23, SDC C at 2:48.31, 
and Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) A at 2:51.11.
The more numerous men's heats had their share of 
difficulties as well. PiKA D was disqualified due to 
interference at the beginning of the heat against Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon A. Later, an impact between SDC C and 
PiKA A led to a disqualification for SDC C on the basis 
of reckless driving following an unintentional collision. 
SPIRITS men's teams again suffered mechanical 
problems, as both the A and C teams buggies spun out 
in the Chute  the fast turn from Schenley Drive onto 
Frew Street  and did not finish their races. Sigma Nu B 
also did not complete its race due to a spinout.
Racing in the final heat of the prelims, SDC A driver and 
senior English major Michelle Mirabella fishtailed on her 
turn into the Chute, but quick work by pushers Devin 
Murray, a senior mechanical engineering major; Evan 
Korol, a junior philosophy, statistics, and SHS student; 
and Casey Piper, a junior H&SS interdisciplinary student, 
on Hills 3 through 5 still scored the team a first-place 
finish for the day. SDC As preliminary time of 2:04.61 
left them two seconds ahead of the nearest competition,

by the same team last year, by 1.31 seconds. Fringe A 
(2:06.55) and SDC B (2:07.85) rounded out the mens top 
three. Sig Ep A, PiKA A, PiKA B, Fringe C, Fringe B,
Sig Ep B, and Sigma Nu A also advanced to Saturday's 
finals.
Final races
Teams in the final races Saturday morning faced cold 
and gray weather, with temperatures in the mid-40s 
after a drop of nearly 30 degrees from the previous day. 
The colder temperatures meant a much smaller crowd 
than usual for Buggy finals races. "The energy level is a 
lot lower because its dreary and cold, said Sara Wingen, 
a senior psychology major and pusher for Fringe A. The 
weather also hindered the teams performances during 
races. The weather definitely affected the speeds and 
times that we saw," McDonald commented.
The day also started with a major upset: SDC, the 
leading contender for both the mens and womens races, 
was disqualified from Competition for violation of a safety 
code. Julian Kessler, the organizations Buggy chair, 
announced in a short statement that all SDC teams had 
been disqualified after a fire marshal noticed a propane 
tank in or near the organizations truck. Sweepstakes 
head judge Andrew Hundt declared the group ineligible 
for competition Saturday.
With SDC out of the race, the field was left wide open 
for the other contenders. Only three of the six women's 
teams remained in the finals. Fringe and PiKA became 
the two remaining contenders in the second day of 
races, with Fringe A taking the top spot with a time
of 2:40.59, and PiKA A coming in second with a time 
of 2:47.38. Fringe B rounded out the womens races, 
finishing a close third at 2:48.53.
The mens races also saw significant changes in the 
leader board, with the two SDC teams eliminated from a 
total of 10. Fringe A finished in first place with a time of 
2:07.50. Sig Ep A came in second with a time of 2:11.22, 
and Fringe B took third in 2:16.32. Fringe C followed 
in fourth place at 2:17.56, and PiKA A came in fifth at 
2:27.35. PiKA B finished with a time of 2:16.32, but was 
disqualified for its Hill 5 pusher not grabbing the push 
bar when crossing the finish line. Sigma Nu A finished 
with a time of 2:19.82, but was disqualified following a 
loss of mass when the buggys left wheel cover came off 
in the Chute: Sig Ep B finished with a time of 2:20.30, 
but was disqualified following a loss of mass on Hill 3, 
where half of the buggys handlebar broke off.
Although the weather had an impact on attendance and 
crowd excitement during the final races this year, there 
were still many lighthearted moments. The exhibition 
races at the start of the day saw many alumni in a 
spirited mood as they re-took their previous roles as 
buggy pushers and drivers. Sigma Nus class of 1985 
cheered as they celebrated victory in their 1985 grudge 
match against PiKA.
Others at the races also commented on having a good 
time. "Buggy embodies all that is amazing about CMU. 
You take something simple and put CMU students on 
it, and it becomes absolutely amazing and ridiculous," 
2008 CIT alumnus Doug Robl said. It has something for 
everyone," said civil engineering masters student Mary 
Ashe, a pusher for SDC. Its nerdy and athletic and has 
a little bit of everything. Its a great thing to be a part
of. McDonald added, Its an awesome combination 
of invention, collaboration, and innovation, and a great 
show of school spirit.

ScotchnSodas show gets down and dirty
Student theater group unveils its production of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels at this years Carnival
With the groups annual Carnival performance this 
year, ScotchnSoda put on the perfect con, which, 
according to director Alex DiClaudio, is synonymous 
with succeeding at putting on a good bit of theater and 
getting paid to do so.
This years play, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, showcased the 
acting and singing talents of the ScotchnSoda cast.
The performance featured most of the win-win elements 
the theater group usually employs: strong voices, catchy 
numbers, great acting, and a hilarious plotline.
The story followed the tale of two conmen: Lawrence 
(played by senior music major Scott Wasserman) and 
Freddy (sophomore music major Sean Pack), who are 
brought together by Freddys desire to be tutored 
by the more experienced Lawrence and earn great 
big stuff. Lawrence rakes in the cash by following a 
straightforward routine: find a wealthy woman traveling 
alone in France, woo her by pretending to be a prince, 
and then take her money by acting helpless and without 
funds to support an ongoing war.
While not central to the plot, one of the highlights of 
the play was the scene in which Lawrence coaches 
Freddy by asking him to observe as he woos a Ms. 
Jolene Oaks from Oklahoma (senior BHA creative 
enterprise management major Shannon Deep). Deeps 
performance as Jolene, complete with her loud accent 
and a rhinestone-studded pink cowboy hat over blond
curls, was powerful. She took the stage by storm during 
the "Oklahoma! number, firing imaginary bullets in the 
air as she danced and sang.
Packs performance also deserves special mention. When 
Lawrences plans with Jolene fall through, Freddy comes 
to his rescue by pretending to be Lawrences mentally 
disabled younger brother Ruprecht. In what can only be 
described as a mildly disgusting performance, Freddy 
succeeds in scaring Jolene away with his obscene 
gestures and repulsive habits  actions that Pack 
performed remarkably, much to the delight and distaste 
of the audience.
The contrast between Lawrence's stuffy, poised 
demeanor and Freddys vulgar, energetic personality is 
interesting to watch. This comparison is highlighted 
when they begin to compete against each other, testing 
who can con the innocent Christine (sophomore music 
major Gillian Hassert) first. Hassert also shone during the 
performance, impressing the audience with her strong 
vocal skills.
As Lawrence and Freddy compete, they depict the 
underlying frustration between greed and morals that 
they face as they go through with their sneaky plans. 
When Lawrence discovers that Christine is not really 
wealthy, he feels guilty and, realizing how noble she is, 
even starts having feelings for her. Freddy, on the other 
hand, is late in hearing the call of his conscience.
Providing additional comedy were Lawrences sidekick 
Andre (BHA student Steven Tietjen) and a victim of 
Lawrences cons Muriel (senior music major Melissa 
Johnson). Andre and Muriels parallel love story provided 
much laughter. Tietjens impeccable French accent was 
a source of much of the hilarity.
The supporting cast entertained well with 
choreographed dance numbers and also provided strpng 
vocal support for the lead singers. The actors shuffled 
among playing the roles of butlers and French maids, 
ticket checkers, sailors, and tourists.
Wasserman, also the artistic director of ScotchnSoda, 
was particularly impressive in the ease with which he 
transitioned from an American con artist to a German 
psychiatrist. His thick German accent, complete with 
yodels when he sang, was simultaneously hilarious and 
surprising.
With a surprise ending, ScotchnSoda succeeded in 
raising the audience members to their feet at the end of 
another great show.

Frances Soong | Art Staff
1. What would you make your Carnival theme?
Disney and Pixar Movies. MP
Zero-Gravity Chamber, like those vertical wind tunnels
where you can skydive endlessly. JWR
My carnival theme would be Robot Attack 2045. IJ
Pornography. JK
90s TV shows. CW
2. If you could make any booth, what would you 
make?
A Monsters, Inc. booth, because the world would be 
awesome if it was powered by laughter. MP 
A six-story booth that I could sleep in. Actually, I would 
just build an apartment closer to campus. IJ 
Id like to simply have a booth full of puppies. Live 
puppies, not fake stuffed or papier-mache ones. Real 
live fuzzy cute puppies. CL 
Kissing booth... with porn stars. JK 
I would make a booth that was completely made and full 
of bubbles. CW
3. What is your favorite Carnival ride, and why?
The Ferris wheel at night. It provides the most beautiful 
view of the city that we can get from campus. And it 
makes the Cathedral of Learning look small. Buahaha!
MP
Anything that makes me dizzy! MD 
I dont like Carnival rides because they dont have any 
foundations, and I only like things that are securely 
cemented into the ground. CW
4. Are you a Dirty Rotten Scoundrel, and why?
Wouldnt you like to know? MK
I am not a Dirty Rotten Scoundrel; I am a Clean Fresh
Scoundrel, thank you very much. IJ
No.CL
Hell yeah. MD
More of just a naughty boy with a dirty rotten mind.
JK
5. What major motion picture would you adopt
into a Carnival musical and why?
Lord of the Rings because I would love to see the 
members of Scotchn'Soda as singing dwarves. JWR 
Shawshank Redemption because who wouldnt want to 
see Morgan Freeman dance? NK 
The 2009 version of Star Trek because a duet with 
Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quito would be irresistible. 
IJ
Hannah Montana the Movie because I feel as though 
it would be really well received by the audience. Also,
I would enjoy seeing the cast of ScotchnSoda do the 
Hoedown Throwdown. MD
6. Booth, Buggy, or Mobot  why?
Booth! I get to use power tools! KK 
Buggy  gotta love the thrills and spills. JWR 
MoBuggy. What could be better than poorly 
programmed buggies driving themselves down a hill?
MK
Booth if we can burn them afterwards; Buggy if the 
drivers are mobots; mobots if they are ruthless killing 
machines. IJ
*
7. Which band would you bring to Carnival, and 
why?
Does Lady Gaga count as a band? Can she pretend to 
be a band so she can perform? Pretty please?! MP 
The Jackson Five. IJ
Right at this second, probably Local Natives. MD
8. What is your favorite Carnival treat, and why?
Funnel cake all the way because its deep-fried batter 
covered in powdered sugar, duh! MP 
Fried Oreos. Who doesn't love your favorite cookie 
deep-fried and covered in sugar? SS 
Cotton candy! MD
9. What is your favorite part of the Carnival 
experience, and why?
Playing in the Kiltie Bands opening concert. Kiltie Band 
is a great organization that I am a part of through the
entire year. The Carnival opening ceremony is a great 
way to end the Kiltie Band season while starting a 
fun-filled weekend. KK
My favorite part of the Carnival experience is it being 
over. You under grads are loud and annoying. IJ 
The Tartans live streaming coverage, obviously. MK
10. If you could bring any comedian to Carnival, 
who would you bring?
Ellen Degeneres because I think Carnival could always
use more spontaneous dancing. MD
Russell Peters. SS
Stephen Colbert. JWR
No J.W., Jon Stewart is way better. NK
11. Whats your best Carnival story?
Its all a blur... MP
I just turned 21, so Ill tell you next year. SS 
So'this one time at band camp... IJ 
The CFA lawn party was by far the best part of Carnival. 
Dancing, costume, and live music! Anyone who 
claimed the party was lame clearly wasnt in the right 
mindset. MD
I worked security shifts all weekend and helped ALLIES 
paint their booth, but the best part by far was my 
awesome shiny security jacket. CW

Alpha Epsilon Pis booth collapsed this 
year during the Friday night of Carnival, 
injuring six patrons of the booth, including 
a laceration of the buttocks for one 
unlucky girl. Well, lets just hope this 
never happens again. We dont want 
any more buttock lacerations, do we?

Debates about showing pornographic 
films on campus were in full swing 
this week after a Maryland senator 
introduced legislature cutting state 
funding for schools that showed adult 
movies. At least in our case, shouldnt 
these movies be mandatory on campus, 
what with the Sex Kills... T-shirts?'
Campus chic
The hottest trends for the spring season spotted this Carnival
The long-awaited spring is here, but who thought 
getting ready for class could be any harder? Nothing 
seems good enough, not for Carnival at least, and 
everyone wants to be up to date with the current 
fashion trends. Here is a rundown on the hottest 
spring fashions to make your outfit decisions a little 
bit easier.
Short shorts
As the temperatures are rising, so is the popularity 
of these hot shorts  smaller than ever. Whether 
they are high-waisted, frayed, threaded, detailed, or 
distressed-washed, all kinds are welcomed.
One-pieces
The words jumper and "romper are both 
synonymous with this creative outfit. This is one of 
the most popular items of clothing for this season. 
Add prints, bustiers, or ruffles, a little twist and turn, 
and you just found yourself a great, simple outfit.
Sheer fabric
Peek-a-boo! Add a little lace or tulle fabric to your 
outfit this spring. Perfect for the weather, these 
fabrics and details are flirty and cute, and they 
lighten up your entire outfit.
Metallics
Now you can dress in all the glam, glitter, and 
sparkle you want, and it fits the fashion trend.
Glam it up from head to toe with metallic clothing 
accessories. If you think you are not bold enough to 
work that metallic-toned dress, try wearing funky 
shoes and a big necklace, or carry a bag with a hint 
of glitter and sparkle.
Exposed backs
Open your closet, search for anything with an open 
back, and use it this season. From the popular 
American Apparel magazines to right here on 
campus, open-backed clothes are in. Racerbacks, 
T-backs, plunging back  there are so many sides 
to this popular trend.
Prints
It isnt a shock to see the popularity of prints this 
season. Watercolors, tribal, floral, or Safari  all are 
raging this spring. From jewelry to shorts to dresses, 
weve seen prints all over the high-fashion runways.
Nautical
Jeans and lots of stripes are always a summer 
favorite. Invest in a versatile pair of white pants. 
Youre guaranteed to wear them all the time.
Prema Agarwal | Photo Staff
Exposed-back dresses are sexy and classy, perfect 
for date night or a Greek formal.
workout fabrics, and academic blazers. Keep in mind 
to tone down the masculinity of this trend with a 
dash of bright color or neat lace.
Caged heels
Last year, the gladiator sandals were undeniably the 
hottest shoe, but this year, an upgrade is in order. 
With massive straps and stiletto heels, caged heels 
have become this seasons must-have.
Ankle flat sandals
Casual and sexy, ankle flat sandals are a lighter and 
better version of last years gladiator sandals. These 
are rare finds  a trendy shoe that you can also 
wear to class.
Colors for this season
This season, either go for the unusual purples 
and yellows or try the neutral tones. If you feel the 
slightest bit cold, dont forget to pair your colored 
ensemble with a universal leather jacket.
Jesse Kummer | Personnel ManagerBack to school
Show your school spirit. Usually we prep for 
back-to-school in August, but this seasons runways 
have been filled with knee socks, preppy stripes,
