Seeking CMU grads, Google plans Pittsburgh office
by Andrew Peters
Staffwriter
Ten years after researchers at Carnegie Mellon 
created Lycos, one of the Webs first search 
engines, Internet giant Google announced that 
it will open a remote engineering office in 
Pittsburgh. Google has appointed Carnegie 
Melion University professor Andrew Moore, of 
the School of Computer Science, as director of 
the new office.
Google, now the most widely accessed search 
engine on Earth, announced in 200S that its 
search engine had an index of over S.l billion 
pages. As it continues to grow. Google needs 
more engineers to research new ways of sort
ing through its massive index of data  and 
it's turning to Carnegie Mellon to provide this 
research.
In a 2005 press release regarding the new 
office. Google stated many qualified Carnegie 
Mellon graduates are choosing to stay in 
Pittsburgh rather than travel to other metro
politan areas with Google offices.
"There are, of course, manv draws to other
geographical regions, but Pittsburgh con
tinues to be a destination point, said Kevin 
Wesley, assistant vice-president for University 
Advancement and deputy director of Alumni 
Relations. Of the almost 68,000 active alumni 
on record, 12.900 have chosen 10 reside in 
Pittsburgh. "The city provides a lot of really 
wonderful quality of life benefits that are attrac
tive to alumni."
According to Google spokesperson Sonya 
Borah. Google wants to take advantage of the 
high concentration of qualified graduates in 
Pittsburgh.
The philosophy at Google is to build where 
great engineers are. We see Pittsburgh as a 
place with a commitment to education, Borah 
said. We are going where the talent is.
The new engineering office will deal with 
Google's technical aspects, focusing on its search 
engine and related technologies. Pittsburgh 
engineers will have to collaborate with several 
other Google facilities in the U.S.. as well as 
research and development offices in Japan, 
India, England, and Switzerland.

Former Pittsburgh mayor Tom Murphy 
spoke on campus last Monday.
by Elizabeth Schwartz
Production Manager
Former Pittsburgh mayor Tom 
Murphy gave a lecture on the trans
formation of Pittsburgh through urban 
design Last Monday in the Adamson 
Wing of Baker Hall.
Murphy, a Democrat, served as 
mayor from 1994 until 2005, finishing 
out his term after he announced he 
would not seek re-election.
With the help of visuals, Murphy 
gave a tour of the newly developed 
areas of Pittsburgh starting with the 
South Side Works. He lamented the 
loss of history in exchange for prog
ress but remained optimistic. Instead 
of a steel mill, we have a Cheesecake 
Factory, he said.
Murphy moved on to the innovative 
techniques used in providing residential 
housing. He used Washington Landing, 
an urban redevelopment on the island 
near Pittsburghs Golden Triangle, as 
an example of a newly established 
development.
Washington Landing was a hazard
ous waste dump that was covered with 
a tennis court, Murphy said.
Murphys lecture had a three-fold 
theme. The first part detailed how 
polluted Pittsburgh was 30 years 
ago and how far it has come since 
then.
Murphy noted that fish have filled 
the rivers again and animals now 
inhabit the forests. Life came back 
to Pittsburgh, said Murphy, because 
of the community will to make it 
happen.
The second part of Murphys lecture 
focused on Pittsburghs tax problem. 
He stated 335,000 people pay taxes

Police arrest a celebrating Steelers fan after 
the Super Bowl.
On Super Bowl Sunday, one for the 
thumb was only the beginning. In honor of 
the Steelers victory, students celebrated 
by using all 10 of their fingers to overturn 
cars, uproot street signs, smash windows, 
set things on fire, and knock over trash 
cans, parking meters, and each other. 
The crowd was like Bourbon Street, said 
Tim Delaney, the chief of the University of 
Pittsburgh Police.
This was the first time [the crowd] 
has come up this far to this end of Forbes 
Avenue, said Carnegie Mellon campus 
police lieutenant John Race. Race report
ed that this years crowd was bigger than 
that of a decade ago, when the Steelers 
lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl 
XXX.
We were prepared this time: We had 
extra people and extra cars out, Race 
said. We didnt want [the crowd] getting 
into the UC.
Race estimated that the crowd in cen
tral Oakland numbered around 10,000 
people.
[The crowd was] probably the biggest 
Ive ever seen in Pittsburgh for any event, 
Delaney said. The Pitt police prepared for 
the crowd by holding meetings with the 
city police to decide what roads to close 
and where to direct traffic, telling shop
keepers to close early, urging residents to 
take their furniture off their porches, and 
by having UPMC and South Side hospital 
security standing by in case of major inci
dents. Nearly 40 University of Pittsburgh 
officers were on duty  half of the total 
department.

Students represent U.S. at LOral competition in Paris
by Michael M. Whiston
Staffwriter
Faced with the challenge of 
drafting a proposal to produce 
millions of cosmetic products, 
a group of Carnegie Mellon 
engineering majors flew to 
Paris in late January to pres
ent their ideas.
The Carnegie Mellon team, 
consisting of junior Alexandra 
Gutschick, junior Daron 
Colflesh, and sophomore 
Kevin Anderson, represented 
the United States in the 2006 
LOreal Ingenius Contest.
LOr^al asked teams from 
around the world to present 
proposals for creating a supply 
chain of 280 million units. In 
organizing and dimensioning 
the supply chain, teams had 
to consider everything from 
raw materials to packaging 
to machinery. Creativity and 
costliness were also factors.
It was a challenge that sur
prised the Carnegie Mellon 
team at first. Why are we 
doing this? Colflesh initially 
wondered. This is business, 
not engineering.
According to Anderson, 
the problem was really about 
problem solving. The team 
had to figure out everything 
from product amount, to 
sizes and types of products, 
to the number of mixing vats 
needed. Anderson was in 
charge of creating the teams 
chemistry-themed catalog.
Looking back, Colflesh 
recalled how difficult it was 
to come up with a creative 
proposal with so little to work 
with. We kept thinking that 
there must be something lost 
in translation, she said, point
ing to the case study that had 
been translated from French 
into English.
To give the team a better 
grasp on the case, coach and
LOreal employee Marc Genco 
gave the team a tour of his 
plant in Cleveland, Ohio. It 
was definitely helpful to see 
the magnitude, Colflesh said.
Designing the plant was the 
most concrete part of the proj
ect, she added.
The team proposed creating 
a new LOreal product line. 
A new supply chain of 280 
million products wasnt going 
to come out of anywhere, 
Anderson explained, so a new 
product line seemed like the 
best answer.
Were going to make our 
lives simple as possible, said 
Gutschick, explaining the 
teams rationale.
It was a plan that won them 
the national competition in 
New York and three plane 
tickets to the international 
competition in Paris, France.
In Paris, teams from Brazil,

Study shows girls unaware of STIs
by Matthew McKee
Staffwriter
Over half of Americas teenagers have 
sex before college. According to a recent 
study, however, many sexually active ad
olescent females do not know the basics 
of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
until the dangers become real.
In a paper published in the Journal 
of Adolescent Health, researchers from 
Carnegie Mellon and the Childrens 
Hospital of Pittsburgh wrote that sexu
ally active girls aged from 14 to 18 years 
who have previously contracted STIs 
knew more about them than girls who 
had not.
Over a period of six months, the re
searchers gave four tests on basic STI 
facts, covering eight different infections. 
The results showed that, aside from 
HIV/AIDS, the sample of 300 Pittsburgh 
girls knew relatively little about the STIs 
if they did not have previous experience 
with them.
This indicates that girls going into a 
sexual situation may be completely un
aware of. the risks they take, leading to 
potentially ruinous consequences.
Some STIs cause increased cancer sus
ceptibility or infertility, and the study 
found that many do not even know 
basic facts about infections other than 
HIV/AIDS.
Most people who have an STI dont 
realize that they have it, said Julie
Downs, the lead author of the study 
and a research faculty member of the 
Department of Social and Decision 
Sciences. They dont realize that if their 
condition is not treated, they can give it 
to their partners.
In addition to not knowing about 
STI symptoms, almost none of the 300 
girls had gone to a doctor for gynecologi
cal tests.
Downs and Pamela Murray, chief of 
the Division of Adolescent Medicine at 
the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh and 
co-author of the study, agree that many 
social prejudices prevent girls from 
openly discussing topics about sex with 
friends and family.
Downs added that this inhibits girls 
from receiving free tests and information 
from local clinics.
In other countries, there are fewer 
stigmas about sexuality and sexual be
haviors. Discussions are public, Murray 
said. Here there is a lot of privacy and 
modesty.
Aside from encouraging a look at soci
etal stigmas, the study also raises issues 
about sexual education. The girls in the 
study knew a good amount about HIV/ 
AIDS but not about the other STIs.
A lot of girls ... are not worried about 
other diseases because they think, Oh, 
its not HIV, Downs said.
Wandi Bruine de Bruin, a research fac
ulty member of the Department of Social 
and Decision Sciences and co-author of 
the study, pointed out that in Pittsburgh,
teenage girls are statistically more 
likely to contract an STI other than 
HIV/AIDS. In fact, no girl who had 
HIV/AIDS participated in the study.
Schools place more emphasis on 
HIV education because it is more of a 
threat and [the education] is in more 
demand, Bruine de Bruin said.
At Schenley High School in Oakland, 
students must meet the Pennsylvania 
requirement of two health courses, 
each totaling one semester. Health 
instructors Judy Vida and James Trent 
teach co-ed courses of about 150 stu
dents every semester.
Both instructors noted their cur
ricula emphasize every condition and 
preventive measure their students will 
need. Their classes stress abstinence 
over other preventive measures and 
show explicit pictures of the infec
tions.
Trent said that he has two lesson 
units of equal length for STIs  one 
deals exclusively with HIV/AIDS 
and the other covers all the rest of 
the STIs.
I think we do an excellent job. 
I dont think one of these kids can 
go out not knowing about all of the 
[STIs], Vida said.
People choose to do scare tactics, 
Murray said regarding explicit pic
tures of STI symptoms. Im not sure 
what [the students] learn from that.

An image of a penis half inserted into 
a vagina, like something that could be 
found in a medical textbook, appeared 
on screen in Scaife Hall 125. Instantly, 
the people around me  about 50 
sophomore and junior social and de
cision science majors  erupted into 
childish giggling. I sighed to myself and 
thought, Arent we more mature than 
that? But as the group continued to re
act to various scenes in the movie, my 
minor irritation grew into absolute dis
may, embarrassment, and confusion.
Last Wednesday evening, I watched 
the film Kinsey for the class Empirical 
Research Methods. The movie is a por
trayal of the life of Alfred Kinsey, the 
first scientist to study human sexual 
behavior. In the late 1940s and early 
1950s, discussion of sex was taboo. 
Kinsey found that there was a great 
divide between what was socially 
acceptable and what happened in real 
peoples lives.
Publicly, sex was for married people, 
solely as a means of procreation. Kinsey 
found that approximately 50 percent 
of men and 26 percent of women had 
some extramarital experience during 
their married lives, that 92 percent 
of males and 62 percent of females 
indicated that they had masturbated, 
and that 37 percent of men and 13 
percent of women reported at least 
one instance of a same-sex experience 
resulting in orgasm.
Except for the scene described above, 
the movie Kinsey was not graphic, but 
it addressed sex outside what is nor
mal with exceptional directness; just 
like 1950s America was unprepared 
for the Kinsey report, much of my class 
couldnt handle the movie. In another 
scene, Kinsey asks a woman in her 60s 
or 70s about her sexual practices. When 
she reports that she is very sexually 
active, some of the students laughed, 
but even more viewers squealed gross 
or eww.
Later in the film, after going to a gay 
bar to collect interviews, Kinsey and his 
assistant Clyde Martin talk about Mar
tins bisexuality. Martin delicately asks 
Kinsey if he has homosexual feelings, 
and the two men kiss tenderly.
At this, the class became uproarious. 
Men turned their heads and the room 
was filled with grunts of revulsion. I 
was shocked, stunned, and taken aback 
that my peers felt offended by such a 
benign portrayal of two men experienc
ing sexual intimacy. I know at least one 
gay man who was in the audience; he 
was appalled by what he heard. I know 
I would have felt a devastating isolation 
had I been in his position.
Juxtapose my classs outrage at 
watching two men kiss with the un
precedented 1000-person turnout at 
the TBA film Pirates.
Nearly one-fifth of the undergradu
ate population came to watch men 
and women having meaningless sex on 
screen.
At Pirates, the audience was equally 
as verbal, hooting and cheering upon 
penetration and ejaculation. Yet two 
men kiss on screen and the class nearly 
breaks into riot.
How is it that most members of a 
community can take some sort of lib
eral stance  arguing that porn should 
be allowed, because we should be open 
about sex  and at the same time gasp 
and turn away at the sight of two men 
kissing?
It wasnt all cheers at Pirates, though. 
At one point, the leading man is ap
proached by a pair of pirate prostitutes, 
but the women are obese; in this case 
too, men in the audience offered rowdy 
boos and grunts of disgust.
Just as Kinsey found in the 1940s, a 
divide persists in society between what 
is socially acceptable and what happens 
in real peoples lives. Sex is only accept
able for public consumption or discus
sion if it happens between a handsome 
man and a beautiful woman (or two). 
Anything that falls outside that unre
alistic comfort zone is unacceptable, 
proving that our supposedly progres
sive society  even just here at CMU  
remains marred by homophobia, ma
chismo, and conservative prudishness.

Academic Affairs Committee retracts support of amendment
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
Following a narrow approval 
in Senate two weeks ago, Stu
dent Body President Tom Sabram 
vetoed a resolution last Monday 
that supported the amendment 
of the Students Rights Policy.
I felt there had not been 
enough support from Senators 
and students to claim we wanted 
this, which could have cost us 
some credibility with the admin
istration, Sabram stated.
After Sabram vetoed the 
resolution, the Senate committee 
pushing the resolution with
drew their support for the 
amendment.
Academic Affairs will no lon
ger be pursuing this in any way, 
regardless of whether or not the 
veto is overturned said Michael 
Bueti at last Thursdays Sen
ate meeting. Bueti is a junior in
STI, from A1
According to Bruine de Bruin, 
many schools favor abstinenceonly education.
The problem is that lot of 
these curricula do not include 
other ways to prevent negative 
outcomes, said Downs, question
ing the traditional exclusive pri
macy of abstinence as a preven
tive measure embraced by such 
schools as Schenley.
Wanting kids to be abstinent is 
one thing, Downs said. Getting 
them to be abstinent [requires] 
telling them about other things.
Bruine de Bruin emphasized 
the need for more behavioral 
training in sexual education be
cause research supports learning 
through role-playing.
However, she finds room for 
concern in the many curricula 
that have not been altered to re
flect new research.
At Schenley High, Trent noted 
their health program has not 
changed much in the 23 years 
that he has taught at the school.
physics and chair of the Academic 
Affairs Committee.
Among the opposition sur
rounding the amendment is its 
link to conservative activist David 
Horowitzs Student Bill of Rights. 
The first proponent of the pro
posal, former Academic Affairs 
chair and fifth-year senior Long 
Pham, incorporated Horowitzs 
language into his original version 
of the amendment.
Long never made the com
mittee or myself aware of his 
full intent when he proposed 
the amendment, Bueti stated, 
noting that Pham did notify the 
committee that the amendments 
language had been drawn from 
Horowitzs bill.
I took this at face value, and 
only recently discovered that 
Longs proposal was taken nearly 
word for word from Horowitzs 
document, and that he had ever 
been contacted by Students for Ac
ademic Freedom, Bueti stated.
The Carnegie Mellon study 
also tested the efficacy of vir
tual negotiation situations 
where girls choose possible 
actions in situations through a 
DVD simulation. According to 
Bruine de Bruin, these simula
tions helped girls make better 
decisions in dealing with men 
and with peer pressure.
Girls think that others 
are having more sex than 
they really are and that its 
okay, said Amanda Cooper, a 
Carnegie Mellon physician and 
assistant professor of medicine 
at the Shadyside Medical 
Center. However, studies 
show that [these estimates] 
are wrong.
We work really hard to 
educate our patients, said 
Carnegie Mellon health educa
tor Kristine Cecchetti.
College is a time that girls 
explore their sexuality and 
they open themselves up to 
problems.
Health Services offers STI 
testing for all students.
Students for Academic Freedom 
(SAF) is a coalition of student or
ganizations that promotes the 
Academic Bill of Rights. Sara 
Dogan, national campus director 
for SAF, contacted Pham in De
cember after reading of Phams 
proposal in the October 17 issue 
of The Tartan.
I do not have a relationship 
with [SAF] and frequently made 
it clear that I was never a fan of its 
leadership, Pham stated. When 
SAF reached out to me in Decem
ber via an e-mail, I did not take 
it seriously and discarded it like 
trash.
There was a great deal of 
information regarding this 
proposal that Long kept from the 
committee, Bueti stated, and 
had I known it at the time, I most 
likely would not have continued 
the process during my time as 
chair of Academic Affairs.
When Senate approved the pro
posal two weeks ago, five Senators
LORAL, from Al
China, France, Germany, Mexico, 
and the United States competed 
for the first-place prize  the

pect, said Gutschick, speaking 
about various teams presenta
tions. Gutschick noted that some 
proposals were flashy while theirs 
was more technical. [Each team] 
had their strengths and they each 
had their weaknesses.
Although the Carnegie Mellon 
team didnt place, the experi
ence was worth it for the team. 
According to Anderson, the studys 
open-endedness made the experi
ence more rewarding because the 
team had created something.
I was impressed with how 
much I felt like I belonged there,

Of the 24 Senators present, nine 
voted in approval and seven voted 
against the proposal.
Support for this amendment 
by the campus community has 
been lukewarm at best, while 
opposition has been fairly strong, 
Bueti stated.
According to Bueti, the amend
ment was intended to clarify 
existing student rights and would 
add a third right in the University 
Policy included in student hand
book The Word.
The proposal read, The third 
right of students is to have their 
work evaluated based on stated 
course and program criteria and 
appropriate knowledge of the 
subjects and disciplines they 
study, as outlined by the relevant 
faculty.
I never agreed with the poten
tial amendment, Sabram stated. 
I dont understand why students 
think it is necessary, considering
all of this is already in The Word."
When the proposal went before 
Faculty Senate on January 24, 
faculty members had a lukewarm 
reaction to the amendment.
Yes, it may be a laudable goal 
to achieve, said mathematical 
sciences department head John 
Mackey at the January Faculty 
Senate meeting. Its just that the 
implementation of it comes at a 
time when maybe were feeling a 
little bit under attack from vari
ous forces.
Following a Student Senate 
resolution, the student body 
president has 120 hours to 
veto the decision, as Sabram 
did last Monday. Senate can 
overturn Sabrams veto with a 
two-thirds vote.
Due to the close nature of the 
vote, we did not take [the Senate 
resolution] as a mandate, Bueti 
stated, and were planning on 
putting the bill on indefinite hold 
prior to the veto.
Google seeks

GOOGLE, from A1
What kind of facility it will be 
depends lot on who we get. A 
lot of great products come from 
these remote sites, Boralv said, 
indicating that Googles plans 
for the new office are not set 
in stone.
Though Google has not 
settled on a site for the new 
office, Boralv notes the offices 
size will depend on the number 
of well-qualified people in the 
Pittsburgh area. As director, 
Moore will play a key role in 
crafting a team of engineers for 
the new office.
Although well start small, 
we plan to grow aggressively 
with a team of top-ranked cre
ative engineers. The folks in 
the Pittsburgh office, including 
myself, will be heavily involved 
in all stages of recruiting, 
Moore' said.
Moore, who took a faculty 
position in the School of 
Computer Science over a 
decade ago. He helps lead a 
research group, the Auton Lab, 
which works to produce new 
methods of statistical data 
mining.
Moore has been informally 
involved with Google for sev
eral years through friends and 
graduate students who moved 
to Google.
With Google, I think 
machine learning is the stron
gest match, Moore said. Ive 
always been interested in 
machine learning algorithms 
that can cope with very large 
amounts of data, so Google is 
an amazing place to be.
Andrew has an incredible 
reputation as an amazing com
puter scientist and we are really 
excited, Boralv said,
Boralv expressed Googles 
hopes that job opportuni
ties created by the new office 
would keep creative minds in 
Pittsburgh.
We are hoping that qualified 
graduates will choose to stay 
in Pittsburgh and work with 
Google, Boralv said.
Steelers fans celebrate by overturning cars, setting fires
RIOT, from A1
of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police stated that 300 
members of the city police force were among 
the 450 total law enforcement personnel on duty 
that night.
According to Race, other than a few minor incidents, 
the crowd was restrained given the number of people on 
the street. In one such incident, students set a couch on 
fire at Forbes and Morewood, which police extinguished 
and moved off the street. Besides a few dug-up bus stop 
signs and a damaged light fixture, there were no fights or 
vandalism.
No Carnegie Mellon students were arrested, though 
three juveniles were arrested in the city.
Elsewhere in Oakland, however, police officers were 
singing a different tune. According to Delaney, Bigelow 
Boulevard and parts of Forbes Avenue were designated as 
celebration areas and closed to cars to eliminate the dan
ger of mixing pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
But that didnt stop students on Bigelow from getting 
rowdy. Around 10:30 pm, students tipped over a Dodge 
Neon between the Cathedral of Learning and the William 
Pitt Union. They proceded to bash out its windows, 
climb on top of it, and dance for 20 minutes until police 
came, according to an article in the Pittsburgh PostGazette.
In total, students overturned four vehicles in Oakland. 
Of the three arrests police made in Oakland, two were 
related to these incidents. One student was arrested for 
flipping over a car, and another was arrested for trying to
put his Terrible Towel into the overturned Dodge Neons 
exhaust pipe and light it.
Thats when police brought out the horses and riot gear. 
[Police] couldnt do anything about the cars because of 
the density of the crowd, Delaney said. [But] no vehicles 
were successfully torched.
The third arrest was for a fire on Atwood Street.
In another fire-related incident, someone took the sign 
off the storefront of the Subway at Forbes and South Craig 
Street and lit it on fire. We let it burn, Delaney said. If 
we could have seen who did it, we would have arrested 
them.
Students also started several small fires, but police were 
able to extinguish them. If you close off Forbes Avenue, 
people take alternate routes, someone lights a fire, and 
now we have gridlock, Delaney said.
He added that the Bigelow area alone held 5000 
people, with more spilling out onto Forbes. In spite of 
this, Delaney reported no deaths or severe injuries. The 
most serious injury he saw was a girl with a twisted or 
broken ankle.
A student also took a walk on the windowsills of the 
pedestrian walkway above Forbes between the David 
Lawrence and Powers buildings on the Pitt campus. [Had 
he fallen,] he probably would have landed on someone, 
Delaney said.
According to an article released by KDKA, there were 
34 overall arrests in the city: 21 for failure to disperse, and 
13 on narcotics charges.
Despite these violations, Delaney stressed that the 
celebration was not a riot. I had more people take phoMarcus Gho/Senior Staff

tographs with me than Ive ever seen in my life, he said. 
Everyone was happy.
Race considered the crowd restrained. We ended up 
working until 1:30 am, he said, and we thought we 
would be there until three or four.
Both campus police departments were proud of the way 
Pittsburgh handled itself during the celebration. Other 
towns are torn apart, but it didnt happen that way, 
Delaney said..
Pittsburgh Police spokeswoman Tammy Ewin agreed. 
Overall, we think people handled themselves very well.

An insight into Yanxi Lius Alzheimers disease research

Junior Staffwriter
The Medical Robotics Technology 
Center (MRTC) and the Vision & 
Autonomous Systems Center (VASC) at 
Carnegie Mellon have been collaborating 
on what promises to be an innovative 
solution to a widely demonstrated prob
lem in aging people. Under the leader
ship of Associate Research Professor 
Yanxi Liu, a project titled Predicting 
Risk of Alzheimers Disease From Shape 
Features is trying to use computer vi
sion techniques to help early detection of 
Alzheimers disease.
So what is this disease whose famed 
victims include Ronald Reagan, Charlton 
Heston, and Rosa Parks? Alzheimers 
disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative dis
ease, commonly causing dementia. It is 
characterized by progressive intellectual 
deterioration, declining daily activities,
and behavioral changes. Memory loss, 
usually manifested as minor forgetfulness, 
is the most noticeable symptom. Amnesia 
progresses steadily as the illness does, 
although older memories can remain rela
tively well-preserved.
Age is the most important risk factor for 
AD. The chance of developing Alzheimers 
doubles every five years for people over 
age 65. Experts estimate that the number 
of Americans with Alzheimers disease 
will continue to grow, and by 2050 the 
number of individuals with Alzheimers 
could range from 11.3 million to 16 mil
lion, according to www.alz.org.
Unfortunately, AD is not easily detected 
until late in its progression. The drugs 
to slow progression might be more ef
fective if they were administered early. 
Brain scans can be used to confirm di
agnosis, but they are unreliable in the 
early stages, though later they will show 
significant, clear loss of brain tissue. 
Detecting AD before symptoms start to
appear is the holy grail of the research 
community.
The basic idea is very simple, 
explained Liu. We are develop
ing computer algorithms to search for 
discriminative features in the MR im
ages of normal elderly brains versus 
Alzheimers-disease brains. In collabora
tion with the NIH Alzheimers Disease 
Research Center at UPMC, we were given 
a set of MR images containing patients 
with AD diagnosis ... and correspond
ing normal controls. We carried out a 
sequence of experiments to map the MR 
structural images to different types of 
image features, search for discriminative 
subspaces, and validate the results using 
cross-validation.
Carnegie Mellon is not the first to 
carry out research in this field. There are 
currently many projects funded by the gov
ernment and the Alzeimers Association to 
facilitate research into how artificial intel
ligence can aid neurologists.
The main difference from other 
projects of this kind perhaps is the ag
gressiveness in our treatment of types and 
dimension of the feature spaces we have 
looked at, ranging from 3D volume and 
image features to features extracted from 
deformation fields that are generated by 
deforming each subjects MR image to 
a reference neuroimage, and the tensor 
fields, said Liu.
Researchers use quantified brain asym
metry for different feature types and un
der different dimensions. To deal with 
such a large volume of features, which 
range in the millions, they also have to 
develop effective feature screening and 
feature selection tools to make the task 
computationally feasible. They are also 
taking full advantage of the computers 
capability to search through the whole 3D 
brain for discriminative regions that may 
or may not be indicated in the literature.

On the heels of creating the first revolution in cell phone 
design in years, Motorola has finally released a follow-up to the 
10-million-selling RAZR. Its new non-flipping cousin shares the 
thin profile, the laser-etched keypad, and the silly four-letter 
vowel-deficient naming scheme: meet the SLVR.
Marketed in the U.S. with Apples iTunes music player as the 
SLVR L7, the phone is an exclusive with Cingular Wireless and 
can be had for the price of $200 plus a two-year contract. I took 
the plunge and bought one; what follows is my impression of the 
device from spending a week with it.
The phone is an elegant device, to be sure; the slightly smaller 
than half-inch-thick black body is both bold and stylish. The key
pad, reminiscent of the iconic RAZR keypad, is slightly smaller
and has a slight bronze tint; raised rubber numbers make it easy 
to use. Blue backlighting on the keys make the numbers clearly 
visible in the dark.
A single mini-USB port provides charging, data connection, and 
headphone connections, eliminating the connector clutter found 
on so many other phones. A small slot on the right side houses the 
included 512-megabyte microSD card. The phones camera and 
music speaker are on the back side.
While its looks may be enough to satisfy most fashion-conscious 
users, the brains inside the phone are where it really begins to 
shine. In addition to all of the standard features youll find on any 
phone, you can sync up to 100 songs between the iTunes library 
on your computer with the phone. The limit, imposed regard
less of how much free space there is on the phone, makes sense:

How Things Work: Aphrodisiacs
Radha Chitale
What is it about some 
things that make you stop in 
your tracks and go Damn!? 
Such is the nature of an 
aphrodisiac. Throughout 
history, a potent aphrodisiac 
to change the ordinary into 
the erotic has been almost as 
elusive as the Philosophers 
Stone. The search has 
spawned multitudes of 
remedies for a lagging libido 
that range from odd to funny 
to dangerous.
An aphrodisiac is a food, 
scent, drug, or device that 
increases desire. The word 
aphrodisiac is derived 
from the name of Aphrodite, 
the Greek goddess of love 
and sexuality.- According to 
Greek mythology, Aphrodite 
sprang from the churning 
sea, which explains why so 
many seafoods are said to 
have aphrodisiac properties.
Perhaps the most notori
ous mood enhancer is the 
legendary Spanish fly. 
Commonly known as the 
blister beede, the active in
gredients in Spanish flies are 
cantharidins. Cantharidins 
irritate the urogenital tract 
and cause swelling. The ef
fect is mistaken for arousal; 
hence the beetles popularity 
as an aphrodisiac. However, 
cantharidins are toxic, as the 
Marquis de Sade, the infa
mous lecher, found when he 
laced bonbons with Spanish 
flies and fed them to his
unsuspecting conquests for 
the evening, who became 
violently sick. Spanish flies 
can also result in comas from 
which there is no recovery.
A more pleasurable way to 
incite passion would be choc
olate. Montezuma, an Aztec 
emperor, drank spiced 
chocolate from 
golden gob
lets in order 
to properly 
attend to 
his harem.
Chocolate 
contains 
two chemi
cals which 
engender 
feelings of 
well-being \ 
and eupho- \ 
ria. The effect * 
of chocolate on \ 
the brain is simi- o 
lar to marijuana but 
uses a different neu
rotransmitter.
In fact, neither mari
juana nor alcohol is an aph
rodisiac. They do lessen in
hibition, but, as Shakespeare 
noted, they provoke the de
sire, but take away the per
formance. Not a good idea 
for action-seekers.
Other foods that inspire 
lust include almonds, pine 
nuts, caviar, truffles, straw
berries  the list goes onv 
In fact, almost every food 
has been hailed as an aph
rodisiac at one time or an
other. However, this has
less to do with the foods 
mood-enhancing abili
ties than their nutritional 
value. Undernourishment 
also decreases the erotic 
appetite. Dietary gratifica
tion improves other types of 
gratification. Foods rich in 
vitamins and minerals 
enhance overall 
physical per
formance and 
well-being. 
Aphrodisiacs 
come in many 
shapes, and 
shape is one 
of the reasons 
some objects 
are touted as 
aphrodisiacs. 
Eastern cultures 
have long consid
ered ginseng an 
aphrodisiac due to 
its resemblance to the 
human body. Crushed 
into powder and eaten, 
rhinoceros horn has long 
been touted as a libido en
hancer. Unfortunately, this 
supposed property has in
creased rhinoceros poaching 
and has contributed to the 
animals status as an endan
gered species.
Other shapely aphrodisiacs 
include bananas, cucum
bers, asparagus, mussels, 
and oysters. Oysters are 
widely known to incite de
sire because they are rich 
in zinc, which is necessary 
for testosterone production. 
Testosterone is one of the
more important hormones 
behind the human sex drive 
for both men and women.
Although considered a 
turn-off in the modern world, 
in the animal kingdom body 
odor is hot. Scent is the most 
effective way to communi
cate readiness to mate. Males 
will follow their lusty noses 
for miles to woo the girl of 
their choice. The chemical 
responsible for those jungle 
romps is a pheromone.
Pheromones are naturally 
occurring chemicals that 
transmit a message to other 
members of the same species. 
Pheromones are not always 
sexual and can signal alarm 
or food. Humans produce 
pheromones too, from the 
apocrine, or sweat, glands, 
which kick into high gear 
during puberty. Pheromones 
could explain why we become 
attracted to others around 
this time. They could also be 
behind the chemistry we 
feel when we meet someone 
particularly lust-inducing. 
However, their role in human 
attraction is unclear.
Controversy over whether 
or not aphrodisiacs are 
effective is ongoing in the 
medical world. Arousal and 
attraction are so subjective 
that it is difficult to accu
rately judge the effect of an 
aphrodisiac. This should re
mind us that, no matter what 
we eat, see, or spritz, the 
mind is the most potent aph
rodisiac of all.

Students learn about 
orbital life
Ever wanted to see what it is 
like to be in space? Well, if you 
were a student studying the In
ternational Space Station (ISS), 
this would be more than a wish. 
Armed with a video camera and 
a sense of humor, the commander 
of the ISS is working hard to show 
students on Earth the ins and outs 
of orbital life.
Commander Bill McArthur has 
tackled everything from a space 
station tour to the orbital lunch 
menu in a series of video vignettes 
aimed at sharing the human 
spaceflight experience. McArthur 
and other NASA ISS astronauts 
have documented their experi
ences via video and other means 
as part of the agencys education 
effort to reach students  and the 
public at large.
For Expedition 12, McArthur 
and flight engineer Valery Tokarev 
have highlighted their holiday 
meals and the differences between 
Russian and U.S. spacesuits. They 
have also detailed how the station 
is controlled by laptop computers, 
how the station generates power, 
and other facets of orbital living. 
The programs have aired on NASA 
TV. To sum it up in McArthurs 
words, If you think this is really 
fun, youre absolutely correct.

Motorola offers new Cingular phone
MOTOROLA, from A4
one of these phones.
Its easy to compare the SLVR 
to my old phone, a Sony Ericsson 
T630. Reception is significantly 
improved, though part of that 
can be attributed to switching 
away from the T-Mobile network 
over to the much better Cingu
lar network. Bluetooth works 
just as well from my computer; 
all of my contacts and calendars 
sync up quite well. The phone is 
also happy to act as a file stor
age device when connected via 
USB, potentially eliminating the 
need to carry around a separate 
keychain drive. I can also use 
the SLVR with my computer for 
Internet connection anywhere, 
something that will undoubtedly 
come in handy.
For an incredibly slick gadget, 
though, there are some short
comings. First and foremost is 
the ridiculously slow speed of 
music transfers. The phone uses 
USB 1.1, a standard at least five 
years out of date, and its limited 
to 12 megabits per second. Trans
ferring 100 songs  an already 
small number by most standards 
 takes nearly an hour, com
pared to two to three minutes on 
a real iPod. Even worse, cancel
ing a transfer in progress takes 
almost a minute, so its easy to 
inadvertently unplug the phone 
during a transfer.
Speaking of which, you should
really avoid doing this. Ive done 
it twice  both times completely 
by accident  and I ended up 
needing to reformat the mem
ory card and start the transfer 
over from scratch both times. 
No kudos to Cingular customer 
support, either; they were com
pletely clueless when I called to 
ask about the problem.
A second shortcoming is the 
lack of integration between the 
iTunes player on the phone and 
the rest of the phones software. 
iTunes is, very literally, an add
on program to this phone. It only 
accesses music stored in a special 
location on the memory card, 
and this music isnt accessible to 
the rest of the phone, so if youll 
want to use one of your favorite 
tunes both within iTunes and as 
a ringtone, youll have to upload 
it twice. Even worse, the phone 
can only use as ringtones songs 
stored in its own six megabytes 
of internal memory, not those on 
the significantly more capacious 
memory card.
Cingulars branding of the 
phone adds a couple of other 
annoyances. For one, only three 
games are bundled, and theyre 
severely limited demos. Also, 
Cingulars Media Net and 
Cingular Mall functions take 
up two of the nine positions on 
the main menu, relegating more 
important functions deep in the 
menus. Compared to Motorolas 
first iTunes phone, the ROKR El,
the interface is mostly the same, 
and many of the complaints that 
came with the ROKR still apply 
to the SLVR with iTunes. The dif
ference is that, compared to the 
ROKR, which added iTunes to 
an otherwise mediocre handset 
(the Moto E398), the SLVR puts 
illmes on a much better phone.
Overall, people who are look
ing only for a music device should 
probably steer towards one of the
Sony Ericsson Walkman phones, 
which dont have the same 
100-song limit or occasionally 
lacking user interface.
People who want a nice phone 
that can secondly play small 
amounts of music, however, will 
find it hard to go wrong with 
the SLVR L7. This phone, de
spite its shortcomings, adds very 
nice functionality to an almost 
unbeatable physical form.

Improved technique for detecting AD
ROBOTICS, from A4
Liu and her team have already made signif
icant breakthroughs. Recently, they showed 
that by using image features around the 
hippocampus, it was possible to find discrim
inative feature subsets for AD, mild cognitive 
impairment, and normal controls.
Our immediate next step is to use a large, 
longitudinal MR image dataset with rich col
lateral information, to learn those features 
from the MR images of a normal subject in 
hope of predicting his or her AD tendency as 
early as possible, explained Liu. '
Using computer vision and machine learn
ing to predict AD is not meant to replace 
current scanning methods. Instead, it would 
work to complement existing PET, CT, and 
MRI scans.
In 2004, scientists at UPMC made a
breakthrough for AD research by completing 
the first human study of a compound that, 
through positron emission tomography, en
ables them to peer into the brains of people 
to see the telltale plaque deposits which are 
believed to be at the root of the disease, Liu 
said. We are in collaboration with the UPMC 
group led by Dr. Julie Price to learn how the 
structural, as well as the functional, MRI and 
PET imaging modalities can complement 
each other. It is our belief that multi-modality imaging and image analysis will lead to 
more effective, safe, and economical technol
ogy for AD diagnosis of the future.
The need for research like Lius cannot be 
stressed enough. Finding a treatment that 
could delay onset by five years could reduce 
the number of individuals with Alzheimers 
disease by nearly 50 percent after 50 years, 
according to www.alz.org. A report commissioned by the Alzheimers Association states 
that Alzheimers disease costs American 
business $61 billion a year. Of that figure, 
$24.6 billion covers Alzheimer health care 
and $36.5 billion covers costs related to 
caregivers of individuals with Alzheimers, 
including lost productivity, absenteeism, 
and worker replacement. With that in mind, 
this could easily qualify as one of Carnegie 
Mellons most important contributions to the 
medical world.
Besides working in the Robotics Institute, 
Liu is associated with the Center for 
Automated Learning and Discovery, part of 
SCS, and she is an adjunct associate professor 
in the radiology department at the University 
of Pittsburgh. The Alzheimers disease proj
ect has been funded by grants from ADRC of 
UPMC, National Institutes of Health, and the 
Health Department of Pennsylvania.

Experiment of the week: Satellite used to study general relativity
by Sean Conroy
Staffwriter
Gravity Probe B, a well-endowed NASA/Stanford 
satellite, is at this moment orbiting the Earth. The 
satellites main feature is its four perfectly spheri
cal, shiny balls. These balls serve as the worlds 
most perfect gyroscopes, used in an extraordinarily 
complex and expensive experiment to observe the 
effects of general relativity.
After Einstein introduced the idea that the fabric 
of space-time is warped by mass, other scientists 
used his theory to predict unexpected phenomena. 
Many general relativity effects have been experi
mentally observed, such as Sir Arthur Eddingtons 
1919 jungle expedition to observe starlight bent 
by the sun. Yet for many years, experimental con
firmation of two additional and important general 
relativity phenomena was missing. Known as the 
frame-dragging effect and the geodetic effect, 
these two features of the theory involved correction 
factors so small that it wasnt until the 21st century 
that they could be measured.
ouuitcay ui ciiisLCiii.siaiiiuiu.cuu
Scientists assemble the two halves of a gyroscope hous
ing in a clean room.
There is no doubt that technology has produced 
an incredible instrument in Gravity Probe B due to 
its small frame-dragging effect. Einsteins theory 
predicts that a rotating massive body should slowly 
frame-drag space and time around with it. Over 
time, this dragging effect should push the gyro
scopes axis of rotation about 40 milliarc-seconds 
out of alignment. Thats the width of a human hair 
as seen from 10 miles. The probe intends to measure 
this to an accuracy of one percent.
At the same time, the gyroscopes should experi
ence a much bigger shift in alignment from the 
geodetic effect. This effect is again due to the Earths 
gravitational field warping space-time, causing a 
circular orbit around the Earth to be slightly shorter 
than pi times the Earths diameter. This is the more 
interesting measurement, since exotic phenomena 
like hidden extra dimensions and undiscovered 
forces could cause deviations from the shift value 
that Einstein predicted: exactly 1.0.
By the projects end, NASA will have spent over 
$700 million. Some are saying this was too much to 
spend on old science. Cheaper, lower-tech experi
ments have already indirectly confirmed the exis
tence of both effects, taking the wind out of Probe 
Bs expensive sails. The satellite itself is the product 
of a 50-year-old idea, and while the end result is an 
incredibly sophisticated measuring device, its task 
may perhaps be less than worthy of the effort.
Carnegie Mellon physics professor Richard 
Holman was blunt: Frankly, I dont know why they 
spent that much money on [the probe]. This project 
has been going on and off for 30 years, and by this 
time, there are a lot of other more interesting re
search projects to sink money into. The chances of 
discovering new science from this are very slim. We 
would have seen the effects already. If GR is wrong, 
we would have already found out.
Yet the potential for confirming general relativity 
to such a high degree of accuracy is very exciting. 
Gravity Probe Bs data collection finished in August 
2005, and data analysis is expected to be completed 
by the end of this summer. Expect Einstein to be 
proven correct by the end of this year.

Bush puts the fun in unfunded mandate
New budget forces public broadcasting stations to make bricks without straw
Oscar the Grouch has been friend
lier to the Sesame Street characters than 
President Bush [has been], congress
man Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said last 
week. And with $157 million possibly 
sliced from the Corporation for Public 
Broadcastings budget in the next two 
years, Bush is a much more serious prob
lem than an ornery green monster living 
in a trash can.
We could be part of a generation that 
slowly watches public broadcasting die 
in America. Both television and radio 
programming are endangered now, as 
more and more of the federal funding 
pie is being diverted to hurricane re
construction and the continuing wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. Bushs new pro
posed spending plan axes 13 percent of 
public broadcastings budget for 2007, 
and almost as much for 2008. Although

Governing body lacks
Undergraduate Student Senate elec
tions come only once a year, but the 
repercussions of having an aloof and 
ineffective representative body plagues 
students all year long.
Two weeks ago, Senate approved a res
olution supporting the proposed amend
ment of the Students Rights Policy by a 
vote of 9-7, with eight Senators abstain
ing. By Senate standards, the only reason 
a Senator should abstain from a vote is 
if there is a conflict of personal interest. 
The Senate chair customarily abstains, 
but there is no excuse for the other seven 
abstentions. It is extraordinarily unlikely 
that seven Senators had a direct conflict 
of interest in the matter, and it is obvi
ous that these Senators either failed to 
research this controversial issue or they 
were too cowardly to take a stand on it.
In Senate, it appears that lazy absten
tions are common and accepted.
Worse still, five Senators didnt bother 
to show up for the meeting. Another 
seven Senate seats remain vacant: CIT 
and H&SS both have two vacant seats, 
while CFA has three openings. These 
vacancies leave 20 percent of our campus 
unrepresented. Current Senators have 
made no attempt to fill these vacant po
sitions, and their best recruitment idea 
is to poster the slogan Rush Student

government. Active recruitment  that 
means going out, talking to people, and 
drawing promising candidates into the 
organization  must be done to produce 
a diverse, proactive, and intelligent legthe head of the Association of Public 
Television Stations has called the cuts 
devastating, Bush isnt listening.
Meanwhile, the largest military budget 
in the world is being inflated once again 
to manage its tentacles abroad.
Stations under the public broadcast
ing umbrella, however, are expected to 
spend millions of their own dollars in a 
second mandate the Bush administra
tion set forth. By February 17, 2009, all 
broadcasting signals in the U.S. will have 
to be digital. Analog TV will be dead, so 
unless you get a new TV or a conversion 
box for your boob tube, plan on sitting in 
front of a black screen.
How is Bush reconciling his two op
posing mandates? Hes not. Its No Child 
Left Behind all over again: mandating 
more, giving less.
If his new budget is put into effect, public broadcasting will have had its funding 
reduced by 24.7 percent, also slashing 
the $65 million specifically requested 
by public broadcasters to help pay for 
digital conversion costs. In the same 
breath, Bush is beefing up the budget 
for the Broadcasting Board of Governors
 the American governments massive 
mouthpiece organization for broadcast 
propaganda abroad  by 4.3 percent. 
This is unjustifiable.
Surely the irony has escaped our es
teemed President. It hasnt escaped PBS. 
Where does this leave Big Bird, the 
Teletubbies, and the rest of the public 
broadcasting family? Considering the to
tal costs for digital conversion will total 
an estimated $1.7 billion  $2 million to 
$6 million per broadcast station  its a 
not-so-beautiful day in the neighborhood

islative body.
Its clear that Senate never took the 
issue of students rights seriously. From 
the day Long Pham introduced his initia
tive, the rest of Senate failed to uncover 
what even a modest amount of research 
and inquiry would have revealed: that 
Phams proposal carried the dangerous 
baggage of David Horowitz, an ultra
conservative activist bent on purging the 
alleged liberal bias out of academia. 
Some of the language of the proposal 
was taken verbatim from Horowitzs 
writings, and claims have arisen that 
Horowitz was personally involved in 
bringing the proposal to our campus.
Horowitz is lobbying state legislatures 
to enact laws that would require profes
sors to create syllabi that reflect the 
uncertainty and unsettled character of 
all human knowledge. In other words, 
professors could be taken to court for 
failing to include sources on their read
ing list that they feel have no academic 
value. His Bill of Rights would constrain 
professors freedom and fence in their intellectualism with the rhetoric of equal
ity and justice.
That no Senator but Pham was aware 
of this background is undeniable evi
dence that they did no research and 
refused to acknowledge news stories and 
editorials published in The Tartan as 
early as August 29, 2005.
The Undergraduate Student Senate 
is an invisible and disconnected body; 
Student Body President Tom Sabram has 
written twice in his weekly column in
The Tartan that he is disappointed in 
Senators unwillingness to elicit constitu
ent opinion before casting votes.
What else has squirmed its way 
through Senate because of student under-representation and Senatorial fee
bleness?
Thankfully, Sabram exercised his ex
ecutive power and vetoed the proposal 
in perhaps the only admirable instance 
of decisiveness in the entire ordeal. Only 
hours before Sabrams veto, Academic 
Affairs Committee Chair Michael Bueti 
quickly terminated his efforts to move 
the proposed amendment towards 
University-wide sanction. The issue is 
closed, for now.
We elect our Senators because we be
lieve they will earnestly take our best 
interests to heart when making decisions 
that affect our daily lives. How could 
they possibily fulfill that responsibility 
if they will not break through their selfimportant isolation?
Unfortunately, at Carnegie Mellon, 
our Senators have completely forgotten 
that part of .their duty to represent stu
dents includes actively conversing with 
them. It involves diligent questioning, 
responsible research, and thoughtful dis
cussion. Apparently, ease of apathy and 
ignorance trumped the earnest service 
of the students who put Senators into 
office.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 13, 2006A7
Is love the ultimate symbol of predestination, or of free will?
Ben Hackett
Is it necessary to annually cel
ebrate something mankind is 
capable of feeling at any moment? 
~ The idea of being able to capture 
something sublime through a tra
ditional celebration is a tempting 
notion. However, the privileged 
among us that have felt a perfect 
connection with another soul do 
not view traditional celebration 
' as a gateway to sublime love. It 
is not the prearranged moments 
""that provide the impetus for emo
tion, but emotion itself which 
provides the impulse.
Love as acceptance of ones sta
tion is a charming notion. Marcus 
Aurelius speaks of love, opining, 
Accept the things to which fate 
binds you, and love the people 
with whom fate brings you to
gether, but do so with all your 
heart. To accept this notion is to 
^ speak of love as a binding force, a 
' force that connects someone with 
the world fate has placed him in.
The idea of loving ones fated 
destiny with entirety is a con
cept lacking in romanticism and 
transcendentalist charms. The 
fatalistic approach removes the 
uplifting power of sublime love. 
Acceptance itself is not a pre
cursor to love. Rather, love, as 
a force, eases ones acceptance 
of the things to which fate does 
bind one. The flaw herein is the 
forcible acceptance of those most 
immediate surroundings. With 
self-determination gone, the idea 
of a wholly sufficient love is less 
plausible.
Rejecting the notion of love 
providing situational acceptance 
alone, the role of love still re
quires definition. St. Thomas 
Aquinas speaks of love as some
thing that takes up where
knowledge leaves off. To speak 
of love as a filling entity to ex
plain the unexplainable speaks 
to the indescribable nature of the 
feeling itself. A powerful force 
indeed, were it to possess the 
ability to fill in the universal gaps 
of knowledge. Here, a religious 
person of much zeal relies on love 
to fill in what our rational minds 
cannot grasp. To subscribe to this 
conception requires a belief that 
love is at least part of the answer 
to philosophical questions beyond 
direct empirical approach.
Love as an answer remains 
a common theme. This time,- 
though, Aquinas offers a notion of 
love as a path to self-realization. 
The things that we love tell us 
what we are, he says. This seems 
like a more modern adaptation 
of the theories of love and loves 
role in relationships. Few con
cepts are more intriguing than 
the idea that in ones loves, part
ners, and objects of affection, a 
gleaning of self-realization is to 
be had. The mystery of identity 
is as reasonably answered by love 
as by any other force.
When one looks over at ones 
love, what is it that one sees? 
The force of love contains the 
power to pervade ones entire es
sence. One looks at that which 
one loves and witnesses charac
teristics present but otherwise 
previously unseen. Raw, sublime 
emotion has a remarkable un
masking power. The pervasion 
of love through the mind-bodysoul as a cleansing agent acts 
to unsheathe true passions lying 
dormant within.
The metaphysical plane is 
the incorporeal region in which 
love makes its residential claim. 
Aristotle sheds the idea of love 
as a real-world tool towards 
self-realization and decries its 
existence on the physical plane, 
putting forth that love is com
posed of a single soul inhabiting 
two bodies. This fully rejects the 
prior notion of love as an easing of 
fatalistic circumstance and hand
ily fits into this overarching the
ory of love as a force. This force 
transcends traditional restrictive 
physical planes combining the es
sence of two into the space of 
one.
This concept of the shared soul 
would seem to make for an easy 
combination with the traditional 
romantic concept of finding ones 
soulmate. However, there is a 
greater premise contained in this 
mode of thought. The nature of 
two entities meshing  connect
ing like puzzle pieces  provides 
the basis for sublime love.
Building on this classical con
cept, imagine a situation where 
there are two souls that match 
seamlessly. This unified quintes
sence, a companionship between 
perfect complements, becomes a 
force that reverberates on both 
the physical and metaphysical 
planes.
To do justice to the concept of 
emotional euphoria and sublime 
love, one must seek it for oneself. 
Philosophical depictions can con
vey only the impressions of their 
authors. These connections exist 
in places that one would never 
suspect as feasible hiding spots 
for love. There is little substi
tute for the unspoken feeling of 
connection.
Danielle Saudino/Dossier Literary Editor
On this plane, the indetermi
nate nature of love is causative 
in its transcension beyond the 
simplicity of verbal expression. 
Perhaps John Donne put it best in 
his poetic work The Good-Morrow 
when he wrote, My face in thine 
eye, thine in mine appeares/And 
true plain hearts do in the faces 
rest. When love is a binding 
entity, devoid of worldly restric
tions, it is shared, but not seen. 
One gazes, smiles, and says noth
ing at all, but is nevertheless 
understood.
Benjamin Hackett invites read
ers to join him at his website, 
BenjaminHackett.com, but only 
after seeking that special someone.
Feminine sexuality can function as cultural resistance
When do forward women stop being considered sluts and start empowering womankind?
Jessica Thurston
Sex.
It propagates our species; it satisfies our 
lust. It is necessity and emotion, domi
nance and submission. It is fully-clothed 
. sensuality and raw nakedness. It embod
ies many extremes, the most important of 
which being this: Sex is a concept as an
cient as the very essence of biological life, 
yet as immediate as our foremost thoughts 
and impulses. When it comes to sex, the 
primordial makes love to the modern. So 
which should we open wider, our minds 
or our legs?
In Western societies, there is a double 
standard which says that only men can 
initiate sex. In other words, sex  fooling 
around, hooking up, taking the 46G to 
Pleasant Hills  takes place only on his 
watch. Once he wants to go, the womans
Jimi Okelana/Comics Editor
timetable is secondary. Sex is an aspect of 
humanity; weve got to do it to keep our
selves going (in more ways than one), but 
is it possible for such an age-old act to be 
manipulated?
How can feminists have their cry?
Traditionally, they couldnt. The public 
imperative of a gal to initiate sex, whether 
intercourse itself or just foreplay, was 
pretty impossible. Even plain forward
ness was unseemly. But maybe, in modern 
times, that notion is teetering on the edge 
of reversal. There might not have to be a 
subservient partner for there to be a domi
nant one. Maybe something about females 
makes them inherently docile, but is it pos
sible, from a psychoanalytical perspective, 
for a female to usurp the sexual throne 
and desire to successfully initiate sex at 
her own will? And if so, is that progressive 
or just plain slutty?
It depends on why she wants it. Sexual 
rebellion has been real for eons  think 
Lysistrata, La Malinche, or even Samantha 
Jones. Women who have openly expressed 
a desire to do it are automatically branded 
strumpets, whores, and easy. But to leave 
the issue here puts an incomplete spin on 
the dice in the game of sexual dominance. 
Being skanky, or traditionally immoral, 
makes a woman further subjugated by the 
dominant masculine culture because shes 
trying to express her sexuality in terms of 
the definitions of men. When that hap
pens, she faces the fate of Thelma and 
Louise or Desdemona: masculine society 
will see' her destroyed.
But then theres cultural resistance, 
the legitimate undermining of the pre
conceived notions of our own culture. In
debilitating the boys, weve got to draw on 
our most primal ingrained female sexual
ity. To effectively resist the stale idea of sex 
as a mans ability to get some, women 
must really want some of their own, and 
then theyve got to act on it  either in
transitively or externally. After all, youve 
got to feel personally satisfied first and so
cially manipulative second. Because when 
you do something that satisfies you, then 
youre taking ownership of yourself. And 
when you do that within the context of 
women initiating sexual emotions and ac
tions, then you achieve personal happi
ness while simultaneously fueling feminist 
power everywhere.
So use the hair toss. Walk the walk. 
Wear the Wonder Bra. Because men, as Im 
told from the very source, are just as tired 
as we are of their stereotypical macho 
role. Bottom line: When you want it for 
you, and youre protecting yourself while 
still putting your pride on the line, all in 
the name of pleasure, its HOT.
Im not pleading for total gender equal
ity in all aspects of the word, because I 
dont think that would be natural. Nor 
am I praising uber-feminism. But as Lady 
Macbeth says, Unsex me here, and in the 
words of Paris Hilton, Live every day like 
its your birthday. So light the candles, 
and go get what you want  carefully, 
proudly, and powerfully.

Explaining 
the Bill of 
Rights veto
______________Tom Sabram
After sitting through the 
Senate meeting last week and 
observing the discussion and 
the vote about the resolution in 
support of the Students Rights 
amendment, I immediately be
gan to question whether I should 
veto this piece of legislation. I 
knew I had 120 hours to decide 
what I should do and that the 
Super Bowl fell within that time 
period. (That was my obligatory 
mention of Super Bowl XL.) On 
Monday, I submitted my veto to 
the chair of the Undergraduate 
Student Senate. This was the first 
veto in three years; Brian Namey 
used the last one to veto the 
Freedom of Information Act. But 
I will forgo the typical article and 
attempt to explain to you the rea
soning behind the veto.
I had a few concerns with the 
passing of the resolution at the 
Undergraduate Student Senate 
meeting on February 2. I voiced 
my opinion about the need for 
Senators to elicit information 
and opinions from their con
stituents and fellow students 
in the weeks leading up to the 
resolution. However, only a few 
Senators were actually able to 
say they had talked about it with 
friends or constituents. This is 
a problem, because the Student 
Senate is to be representative of 
all undergraduate students  a 
statement that was reinforced 
within the body of the resolution
 and in order to do this prop
erly it must determine what the 
students want.
The lack of input that Senators 
gathered from their constituents 
caused several Senators to ab
stain or vote no on this resolu
tion. With a final vote of 9-7-8, 
only 37.5 percent of Senators 
present actually voted in favor of 
the resolution. The 15 votes not 
in favor failed to provide enough 
support for a piece of legislation 
like this. I believe Senate needs 
to be held accountable for inac
curately representing students. 
I believe this is a major prob
lem. Yet I still have other con
cerns about the Students Rights 
amendment.
By now you have probably 
heard the name David Horowitz 
or heard of Students for Academic 
Freedom, yet these are not my 
concerns. Rather, I question if 
the policy is actually necessary, 
as there have only been three 
applicable cases in the past five 
years. Also, there is already a 
section in The Word which deals 
with the right to be graded based 
on the stated course criteria.
I am happy with the work 
Academic Affairs has done in ex
plaining the policy amendment 
process, though I do encourage 
them to start working on endeav
ors others than the proposed 
amendment.
Tom Sabram can be reached via 
e-mail (sbp@J or by phone at 412- 
657-3953. He would like to stop 
dealing with the Students Rights 
Policy.

the same story, with the Tartans 
holding off the Judges attempted 
runs. Sophomore point guard 
Geoff Kozak ran the Tartan of
fense, dishing out four assists and 
scoring 12 points. The Tartans 
held on for an 86-74 victory.
After dropping Friday nights 
game, our backs were against the 
wall and we had to step up and 
win out if we want to win the 
UAAs, said junior Greg Gonzalez 
after the Brandeis victory.
With the win, and an NYU loss 
to Rochester 67-53, the Tartan
men once again take sole pos
session of the UAA conference 
lead. Even though they are in first 
place, the team knows that they 
are now in control of their own 
destiny. As senior forward Bary 
Dunn said after yesterdays vic
tory, Its a big confidence boost. 
Were back in the drivers seat. We 
can watch what happens around 
the league, but what it boils down 
to is that were in first place  
alone  and we just gotta take 
each of these last three games one 
at a time. We dont need anyones 
help. Three games. One at a time. 
And the league is ours.

Despite fighting back in the 
second half from a 35-27 defi
cit, the Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team came up just 
short Friday night against UAA 
opponent New York University 
on a buzzer-beating shot at the 
end of regulation.
In front of another packed 
crowd at Skibo Gymnasium, 
the Tartans came out fighting 
against the Violets of NYU, who 
were itching to avenge a loss to 
Carnegie Mellon in double over
time on January 8 in New York. 
The score went back and forth 
until NYU took control with just 
over nine minutes left in the first 
half, building on their lead and 
going into halftime up 35-27.
At the start of the second 
half it appeared as though the 
Violets had a firm grasp on the 
game, refusing to relinquish the 
lead. However, the Tartan men 
slowly mounted a comeback and 
took the lead off a huge threepointer by junior guard Brad 
Matta with 7:45 left in the game. 
With the crowd revitalized, the 
Tartans rode their momentum 
and extended the lead to 57- 
50 with 5:05 to go after senior 
Clayton Barlow-Wilcox made a 
layup while being fouled, con
verting the free throw. But NYU 
senior guard Jason Kildare hit 
two back-to-back shots to cut the 
Tartan lead to just three.
With less than two minutes 
left in the game, NYUs Kildare
connected on another shot to tie 
the game at 59. The Violets stole 
the ball with 26 seconds remain
ing after the Tartans attempted 
to go inside to Barlow-Wilcox. 
With seconds remaining, NYUs 
Michael Magee, who was 6 for 
16 in three-point attempts going 
into the game, connected when, 
his three-pointer bounced in off 
the backboard as time expired. 
With the loss, the Tartans and 
Violets both clinched a share of 
the UAA lead.
After the game, Matta com
mented on the buzzer-beating 
loss. We let one get away. Give 
NYU credit: they hit big shots 
when they had to, he said. 
Even though this was a tough 
loss, we arent going to hold our 
heads down. We know every 
team is out to get us, so we are 
just going to have to work that 
much harder in practice and in 
games.
Sundays game against the 
Judges of Brandeis was a dif
ferent story. The Tartans sought 
redemption for Fridays loss and 
proof that they were still the 
best team in the UAA confer
ence. Despite coming out slow in 
the first halves of recent games, 
the Tartans took an early lead 
of 14-6 about four minutes into 
the game, and held onto the 
lead throughout. Co-captain 
Barlow-Wilcox led the Tartans 
with 10 points in the first half, 
and helped secure a 47-40 lead 
going into half time.

Sports Editor
Carnegie( Mellon mens and 
womens indoor track and field 
teams competed at the Oberlin 
Invitational Friday night. The 
mens team finished first and the 
womens team captured third.
The mens indoor track and field 
team finished first out of six teams 
with 138 points, 15 points ahead 
of second-place Thiel College. 
Carnegie Mellon junior Eric Tang 
won both the 55-meter dash with 
a time of 6.70 seconds and the

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens swimming teams, 
considered to be some of the 
most formidable opponents to 
the reigning University Athletic 
Association (UAA) cham
pion Emory, were unable to 
pull off an upset at this weeks 
UAA Championships at Emory 
University. The meet concluded 
on Saturday, with both teams fin
ishing fourth overall. The mens 
team tallied 453.50 points and 
the womens 412.
The Tartan women started 
strong with 163 points and a second-place finish after the first day 
of competition behind Emory, 
while the Tartan men finished 
the first day with 125 points and 
in fourth-place. During the first 
day of competition, senior Brian 
Hunter and junior Jenny Sieger 
were able to secure individual UAA 
titles. Hunter won the 200-yard 
IM with a time of 1:53.70, while 
Seiger clocked a time of 24.26 to 
win the 50-yard freestyle.
Alongside these individual 
honors, Julie Pavia secured sec
ond-place with a 406.15 point 
performance on the one-meter 
board. Senior Allie Theus and 
sophomores Lauren Connell and
Emily Tong finished second in 
the 200-yard freestyle relay, with 
a time of 1:39.01  a time good 
enough to make the NCAA B 
cut. The three women teamed 
up with sophomore Alex Kinzler 
to turn in a time of 4:03.10 in 
the 400-yard medley relay, secur
ing another second-place finish. 
The men also held their own 
with a second-place finish in the 
400-yard medley relay. Seniors 
Hunter and Evan Powell, junior 
David Krzeminski, and sopho
more Michael Bailey finished 
with a season best of 3:28.23, 
making the NCAA B cut. Other 
top individual finishes for the 
Tartans included Kinzlers fifthplace finish in the 200-yard IM 
(2:12.21), and a sixth-place fin
ish for Connell in the 50-yard 
freestyle (24.84).
Following the promising first 
day of competition, the Tartan 
women were unable to keep their 
second-place position as both 
teams finished'day two in fourthplace, racking up point totals of 
307 for the women and 287 for 
the men. Krzeminski placed sec
ond in the 100-yard butterfly with 
a time of 50.35. the Tartans came 
in third for both 200-yard med
ley relays, where the mens team 
comprised Krzeminski, Hunter, 
Powell, and first-year Ryan Piper, 
and the womens team Tong,
Theus, Sieger, and Kinzler. Other 
notable performances for the 
women included a fourth-place 
finish by Theus in the 100-yard 
butterfly (59.84) and a fifth-place 
finish by Tong in the 100-yard 
backstroke (1:00.73). Powell fin
ished third in the mens 100-yard 
backstroke with teammate Piper 
coming in seventh. The mens 
800-yard freestyle relay team 
comprised Krzeminski, Hunter, 
and sophomores Andy Douglas 
and Michael Bailey; it finished 
fourth with a time of 6:57.
The Tartans were determined 
to climb back into the top three 
entering the final day of the cham
pionship, as Kzeminski turned in 
a first-place finish for the Tartans 
in the 200-meter butterfly with a 
time of 1:53.18. This would turn 
out to be the only first-place fin
ish for the Tartans.
The mens team definite
ly needs more depth, said 
Krzeminski. With only 17 of a 
possible 22 men on our confer
ence team, the lack of numbers 
certainly puts us at a disadvan
tage walking through the door. 
Also, the mens [team] is losing 
some amazing talent, so some 
of the underclassmen need to 
step up.

University Athletic Association 
(UAA) games this weekend in 
Skibo Gymnasium. On Friday 
night, they hung tough with the 
#17-ranked New York University 
Violets but in the end fell short, 
losing 58-50. Then on Sunday 
afternoon, the strong post play of 
the #15-ranked Brandeis Judges 
was too much for Carnegie 
Mellon as the Tartans lost 66-51. 
The losses drop the Tartans to 5-
17 overall and 0-11 in the UAA.
Against NYU, first-year for
ward Jeanette Schillings layup 
off sophomore guard Leah 
Feolas pass resulted in a Tartan 
lead, 11-10, with 12:43 remain
ing in the first half. But after 
that, the Tartans fell behind and 
went into the second half down 
32-22.
In the pivotal first five minutes 
of the second half, the Tartans 
went on a 12-3 run to close the 
gap to 35-34 at the 16:07 mark. 
After a New York timeout, the 
Violets answered with a 10-2 run 
to increase their lead to 45-36. 
Carnegie Mellon didnt wither
away, however, as they stepped 
up their defense and closed the 
margin to two points with 3:05 
remaining. The Tartans had sev
eral chances to tie or take the 
lead, but each opportunity was 
thwarted by the Violet defense, 
which stepped up to the threat. 
A three-pointer by first-year 
guard Gemma Easterling that 
would have given the Tartans
the lead with 2:25 left fell short, 
and the Violets rebounded and 
made their foul shots the rest of 
the way to put the game out of 
reach.
I thought we played really 
well; it was one of the games 
where I felt we had a team ef
fort, said head coach Gerri 
Seidl. We played within our
selves and played hard and with 
poise offensively. The Tartans 
stingy defense held the Violets 
to 31.7 percent shooting for the 
game, including only 24 percent 
in the second half.
Seidl was proud of her teams 
defensive effort. To hold them 
to 58 points is a testament to our 
defensive ability, she said. We 
were worried about their transi
tion game and I thought we did 
a nice job of helping out on de
fense and encouraging more of a 
jump shot, while taking away the 
dribble penetration.
Carnegie Mellon trailed 
Brandeis all of Sundays game, 
finally getting close at 35-30 
early in the second half. The 
Judges continued to pound away 
inside and draw fouls resulting 
in successful free throws. The 
Brandeis lead got as big as 18 
points on two occasions, includ
ing 61-43 with 5:32 remaining 
before ending up at 15 when the 
final buzzer sounded.
Schilling came off the bench to 
lead the Tartans with 12 points 
against both the Violets and the 
Judges. Easterling added nine 
points on Friday, while senior 
Dava Sommermeyer contributed
11 points and nine rebounds on 
Sunday against Brandeis.

and Case Western Reserve 
University before wrapping up 
their home schedule when they 
battle Rochester University on 
Saturday, February 25, at 2 pm 
in Skibo Gymnasium.

Whats love got to do with it?
You dont have to have love, but you should have a heart
Tina Turner never answered the question: What 
exactly does love have to do with it? And yes, by 
it," I mean sex.
Its that time in our lives when we all must 
experiment. Does sex require us to be in love 
with our partner? It depends who you ask. The 
Catholic Church? The Pope just shot you a dirty 
look, so I guess thats a yes. That boy you met at 
a party last weekend? Definitely not.
So theres a difference of opinion, obviously, but 
I believe there is one fail-safe rule to apply in 
college sexual encounters: There should at least 
be strong affections. Loves a silly thing. Ive 
heard it described as the greatest of all emotions. 
And as the worst. And as a random firing of 
synapses in the brain that is intended to keep us, 
as a species, alive. Its worthless to try to define 
love and apply it.
Affection, though, is a definite yes. You may 
scoff, Of course, silly! Recall that a few drinks is 
not a prerequisite to affection and, hence, is not a 
pre-prerequisite to jumping in the sack. Similarly, 
the phrase He was really hot" should not cut it. 
Were not dreaming over pictures of Johnny Depp 
anymore, kids; were talking about the big one. 
Hopefully, were also talking about the Big 0. And 
no, I don^t mean Oprah.
In my own limited experience, and that of 
my friends, no random encounters have ever 
yielded prolonged happiness. Not just sex itself, 
but all the preliminaries. In college, sex and 
its precursors are too often linked to alcohol, 
impulsivity, or both. I dont want to sound like 
your mother, but its true. And though I think that 
ultimately men do feel differently about the need 
for true affection and regard for a partner, I do 
think they are lying when they say that random 
fooling around does not yield more.
We are social creatures. Everyone  yes, 
even the homiest among us  is hoping for 
a connection beyond the sex. But if it's just 
your body parts that are connecting, youll feel 
numbed in the long run, rather than exhilarated.
I like to believe that we the people actually 
believe in joy that passes between two people 
who have something in common, more than just 
mutual release of bodily fluids (or not, for the 
unfortunate). Call me crazy.
As for the old adage, Who needs a heart, when a 
heart can be broken?" I believe whole-heartedly 
(pun intended) that we can experience greater 
pain on the so-called morning after if we feel 
nothing for the person we have shared our 
moment with. And guys,-you arent fooling me; 
sometimes it really is a moment.
And as for the L-word? Well, youll get very 
different stories from folks if you try to discover
what love is. Its a function of the songs we've 
written about it. Its one of the most-discussed 
topics in popular music from any era. If we 
comprehended its meanings we would no longer 
sing about it. There are somewhat fewer songs 
about sex. No, the Bloodhound Gang doesn't 
count.
Like I said, I dont mean to be your mama. Girls 
and guys alike have championed the cause of 
casual sex. I am not about to tell you that sex 
without love is like cookies without milk. In 
fact, sometimes mixing sex and love can cause 
unexpected issues. It's harder to tell the one you 
love that youre not satisfied in the bedroom. 
Conversely, I don't know if its easier to tell a 
relative stranger that they got to rub you the right 
way. Some may say that random sex is a great 
time. Those people also have jock itch. Seriously, 
though, keep in mind that they dont call it The 
Walk of Shame because its a great time.
If you want someone beside you in bed, there 
are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, you 
want to walk out with no regrets. This means no 
sex with people you don't know from John Smith. 
Second, if there is some mutual appreciation 
between two people, youre less likely to get into 
a situation where its uncomfortable. Too many 
of my friends have been jacked up by having 
sex or something like it with someone who just 
didnt care if they lived or died after that. Third, 
this advice applies to guys: Men are not immune 
to emotions, no matter what game they talk. The 
rejection of a lover when you realize it was a onenight fling can'be just as painful on either side of 
the Adam and Eve equation.
Love may have nothing to do with it, but feeling 
should have something to do with it. Without the 
feeling, you may as well have stayed home and 
killed a kitten.

Log on for love
Dating in the age of the Internet
Once upon a time, lovers courted each other with flowers, 
poems, and good manners. Maybe that's a little simplistic, but 
still  there was a time when people went out of their way to 
show each other how much they cared for one another, and 
this usually required meeting in person. Of course, people 
still do go on dates  to Fuel and Fuddle  after they have 
been dating for a few months. With the advent of modem 
technology, specifically the Internet, people have begun to 
surf the web and join social sites, such as facebook.com, 
xuqa.com, match.com, ciaigslist.com, and matchmakei.com 
to meet their future mates.
Despite the increasing number of users, there is still a stigma 
around Internet dating: Only desperate, balding 40-year-olds 
or ladies with dozens of cats and spoon collections go online 
to date. College students desperate for a date to a wine and 
cheese party certainly don't want to resort to dating-specific 
sites, such as match.com, matchmakei.com, or eharmony. 
com. That would seem, well, desperate. Instead, there are 
more socially acceptable sites that arent all about hooking up, 
at least on the surface.
Virtually connected
Computer science major jokes aside, there are plenty of 
students from all majors who are on the shy side at Carnegie 
Mellon. And with the rigorous academic load here, it is 
difficult to find the time to date, let alone the courage. 
Sophomore history and policy major Becky Armady described
how Facebook has changed dating on campus: I think that 
it has helped people who are shy and would not speak to the 
person they liked otherwise.
Does online dating help or hurt relationships? "My friends, 
both male and female, get almost as excited about online 
flirting as they would about real flirting. But I think that 
the craze of Facebook and Myspace and others like it has 
caused problems in relationships. Ive heard many stories 
from my friends saying that their significant other saw that 
someone left a flirt message on their wall and then they got 
into a fight about fidelity and trust. Its really insane how the 
lines of reality and virtual reality affect something like love 
relationships," Armady explained.
Brian Leary, a first-year mathematical sciences major, agrees 
with Armady that Facebook is still no substitute for real 
relationships. As far as dating and relationships go, I see little 
advantage to Facebook. It doesnt help you meet people in 
the traditional sense; it simply informs you of their existence," 
Leary said.
All about the image
And then there is the question about how much you can 
tell about people from their online profiles. Since people can 
project any image they want online, it is hard to trust any of 
the information they post about themselves.
Leary founded the Facebook group Facebook: Helping 
Stalkers Watch You from Afar Since 2004 with a very clear 
goal in mind: to disprove the notion that females care more 
about personality than appearance." Leary "created a high 
school Facebook [account] easily" and did a Google image 
search for 'cute boy, and selected the one who my girlfriend
found to be cutest. Using this as my picture, I randomly 
selected about 30 to 40 girls and attempted to add them as my 
friend. Nearly everyone confirmed me, and before long I was 
being asked to be the friend of dozens of girls who did not 
know me at all, and I can only assume they chose to add me 
on the basis of my appearance alone. Some even decided to 
message me to tell me how cute T was, Leary recalled.
Protecting yourself
Learys experiment brings up another important point: When 
the Internet enters the realm of dating, protecting yourself 
means more than just practicing safe sex. Since it is easy to 
fake an e-mail address and create an online profile, you can 
never be too sure who that "cute guy or girl you are talking 
to is.
Leary realized, "It is not that difficult to see a face on campus, 
sort Facebook entries by some distinguishing characteristic 
(a known class, major, residence hall, etc.), and locate the 
person you are looking for without the person knowing about 
it at all. I find it all to be a little bit creepy, so I created the 
. aforementioned Facebook group to call attention to this fact.
Sometimes, it can be hard to see the writing on the wall 
when you are interested in someone. The writing on the 
Facebook.com walls can be a lot clearer. But as with any 
online social site, there are dangers to meeting people online 
and huge privacy issues at stake. So go ahead and monitor 
the relationship status of your crush, but be sure to take their 
profile at face value.
Amanda Flynn | Contributing Editor
Facebook.com considers itself "an online directory that 
connects people through social networks-at schools. No 
mention of dating there, but admit it: if you've ever used 
Facebook, chances are that you've checked the relationship 
status of someone you are interested in.

pillbox 2.13.06

---------------------------------------------------

Unless you marry your first love, there is a good chance that 
you will have a story to tell about an ex: an ex-girlfriend, an 
ex-boyfriend, an ex-lover, an ex-I-have-no-idea-what-thehell-we-were-anyway. And if you have not had an ex, you 
have probably been exposed to the wide range of break-up 
scenarios anyway Media and entertainment thrive on it. What 
exactly makes the topic of breaking up and the embodiment 
of the ex such a prominent one? Lets unfold this:
According to Steve Duck, a professor at the University ofIowa and an avid researcher in communication studies, there 
are four major steps involved in the dissolution of a romantic 
relationship:
1. The problem is recognized. One or both partners may 
recognize it.
2. The problem is discussed. Negotiations occur in attempt 
to save the relationship.
3. The relationship has transformed. The break-up is made 
public and involves stories of face-saving and blame.
4. The break-up must be dealt with. Physically arid 
psychologically, the relationship ends here. Each partner 
comes up with his or her own version of what happened 
and they each engage in activities designed to "get over it.
Without a doubt, the last step is the hardest. I don't care if you 
were the one who decided that you were better off without 
him or that she just wasnt good enough for you. Its tough.
Joan Knihnicki, a Carnegie Mellon graduate student studying 
social psychology, described breaking up as the separation 
from an attachment figure. [This is] a figure from whom we 
get lots of our needs met, including a secure base from which 
we can explore the world and a safe haven to turn to in times 
of stress, Knihnicki said. When we break up, We are losing 
this and it is completely natural to be distressed."
However, Knihnicki emphasized that the multitude of 
emotions and behaviors associated with a break-up are
different for everyone. The emotions and behaviors include 
distress, jealousy, blame, control, coping, and decision
making. What determines your pathway beyond the break
up has a lot to do with whether or not the break-up was 
mutual. Were you the one who was dumped? Or were you the 
merciless dumper?
Chante Cox-Boyd, a Carnegie Mellon social psychology 
professor, examined a typical pathway the dumped might 
experience. Usually, people come up with their own version 
of the break-up in order to make themselves feel good about 
the relationship. For example, if someone broke up with me,
I would tend to selectively remember the times when I was 
unhappy [so that I could] feel as if the break-up was a good 
thing for me too.
And naturally, being dumped hurts your self-image. Cox-Boyd 
said, "Having someone in our lives tends to reinforce the view 
that we are worthy, desirable people."
The depth and length of the relationship, in addition to your 
options following the break-up, come into play. Cox-Boyd said, 
"If I break up with a guy, but there are three others waiting in 
the wings, I tend to let go of the relationship more easily than 
would someone who has no other alternative partners."
You are hurt. You become jealous. You become bitter. How 
healthy is it to be overwhelmed with the idea of failed 
relationships? Cox-Boyd believes that society focuses too 
much on break-ups, and that this makes people believe that 
the option for a bad relationship is a break-up rather than 
working on keeping it going."
But the entertainment industry does bank on happy reunions 
too. Think Ross and Rachel, Carrie and Big, Joey and Pacey, 
Marissa and Ryan, and Seth and Summer. Celine Dion just 
needed to be kissed like that to know that it was all coming 
back to her now. And Mariah is going to let you fly because 
she knows that youll always be her baby. Its cheesy, but
there is always that hope of it working out again. This person 
knows you inside-out. This person was once your partner, 
your confidant, and your best friend. You shared moments 
of intimacy. You shared ice cream. You were together for 
a reason. And sometimes, on a Friday night, it seems all 
too easy to slip into the comfort of what once was. There is 
a chance that the spark will return, that you will embrace 
passionately and wed soon after.
There is also a chance that you will never see your ex again. 
And thats fine too, because all relationships provide us with 
immeasurable lessons and insights. They define for us what 
a relationship is. Cox-Boyd explained, The way in which we 
judge all of our relationships is based on a comparison level 
which is composed of the average expected outcome in a 
relationship."
Above all, the first relationship holds a special place in our 
hearts and in our minds. Due to the primacy effect, the first 
information we have on relationships can have a stronger 
impact on how we view later ones, because they can set up 
the schema regarding relationships in general. Lesley Ridge, 
a sophomore creative and professional writing double major, 
agreed: "After dating someone, especially your first boyfriend 
or girlfriend, you have a better idea of what you want out of a 
relationship from the other person as well as what you need to 
do to make a relationship work.
Bearing in mind my own experiences, I have decided that the 
role of exes in our lives is a significant one. Whether you still 
think of them fondly or not does not matter. What matters is, 
at the time you were with them... you were getting laid. No
 you were growing as an individual. You were preparing for 
your future relationships. You were learning to love.

Joannie Wu and 
Alex Smith are the 
DJs of WRCT's 
sex show.
Marcus Gho | Senior StaffMarcus Gho | Senior StaffMarcus Gho | Senior Staff
You cant see sex on the radio
WRCTs sex show is a 10 pm turn-on
"Sex is a creative, unitive act. Sex is about communication. 
Radio regulation should be about communication, too."
Revolutionary Ideas for Radio Regulation, Douglas Galbi
People need to be informed about sex, and as sophomore design 
major Joannie Wu said, "The best way to get people to learn is 
if they like what theyre listening to." A show like WRCTs Is 
it in Yet? is a key device for communicating the issues of sex 
to the Carnegie Mellon campus. The information on the show 
is presented in a humorous manner; its not like the sexual 
education class you took in high school where everything was 
serious and you were asked to leave the room if you started 
laughing. Its more like an hour-long relaxed discussion of a sexrelated topic full of facts, opinions, puns, and innuendoes.
Hosted by Wu and Alex Smith, a sophomore math major, the 
show covers important topics such as STDs and gay/lesbian 
issues, as well as special features such as an interview with 
a dominatrix. The hosts try to present information that is 
interesting, but not necessarily obscure.
Its the stuff that people wouldnt go out of their way to 
learn about, even though theyre curious, said Wu. Many of 
the topics come from the hosts personal interest or popular 
questions from friends. They do a bit of pre-friend research 
before the show to broaden their knowledge and perspective of 
the subjects. It is (obviously) subjective, as they can't possibly 
know everything about the topics. The callers during the show 
contribute greatly to the content. The hosts find themselves 
answering questions ranging from your typical relationship 
problems to Is semen vegan?
But how far can they really go?
A disclaimer before every show states that the contents discuss 
sex, that the opinions are of the participants, and that listener 
discretion is advised." And, of course, all of the callers on the 
show are disguised with aliases.
The radio can be Limiting  the hosts cant just show their 
listeners a diagram; they have to describe it. And how exactly 
do they describe it? Well, as you might have guessed, there are 
several words that are taboo on the radio.
broadcast indecency as language or material that, in context, 
depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, 
sexual or excretory organs or activities. Indecent programming 
contains patently offensive sexual or excretory material that 
does not rise to the level of obscenity. Profane speech is 
prohibited on broadcast radio (and television) between the 
hours of 6 am and 10 pm. As the show goes on at 10 pm, it has a 
bit more freedom, but the hosts still have to keep it PG.
In addition, obscene material is not protected by the First 
Amendment to the Constitution and cannot be broadcast at any 
time. The Supreme Court has established that, to be obscene, 
material must meet a three-pronged test:
* An average person, applying contemporary community 
standards, must find that the material, as a whole, appeals to 
the prurient interest;
* The material must depict or describe, in a patently offensive 
way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable law; 
and
* The material, taken as a whole, must lack serious literary, 
artistic, political, or scientific value.
The hosts say that censoring their language is not as difficult 
as it may seem. We speak with clinical terms," said Wu. "We 
dont need to say cock to get the point across; we can just 
say penis. They also have their producers there to catch any 
slip-ups. The callers on the show have greater difficulty with 
censoring, as they have not developed this skill as the DJs have. 
In order to minimize this problem, there is a seven-second delay 
when the caller goes on the air. Actually, being on the radio 
can be advantageous because the hosts can describe things (in 
clinical terms) that they would not be able to show on TV.
As Smith said, "Every college radio needs a sex show." For all of 
you who would like to go against the classic mindset sex kills, 
come to CMU and live forever" and would like a chance to talk 
about sex, tune into 88.3 FM WRCT at 10 pm on Wednesday 
night, and as Salt n Pepa sang in their infamous hit Lets 
Talk About Sex," Dont decoy, avoid, or make void the topic" 
because, I promise, that aint gonna stop it.

Top Five Movies to Watch Instead of Making 
a Burn Book
What better way to spend Valentines Day alone 
than to curl up with your laptop and watch one of 
these movies that will make you think twice about 
love... or forget about it altogether.
5. The Boondock Saints: Hot Irish guys with guns 
and Willem Dafoe in drag. Need we say more?
4. High Fidelity: The bitterest of bitter. Sure, it 
(SPOILER!) has a haifway happy ending, but what 
about the rest of the movie? Besides, Jack Black 
does a mean cover of Marvin Gayes Lets Get
It On.
3. Wet Hot American Summer: Teenagers. At 
camp. Long-lasting love? Psht, long-lasting love 
my ass.
2. Mean Girls: High school bitchfests and calculus 
drama? To quote Mugatu, Soooo hot right now.
1. Pirates: Its Valentines Day. Youre lonely. Were 
not here to judge.
Top Five Movies to Watch With Your Sweetie
So youre one of the few at Carnegie Mellon 
to have found someone to share this over
commercialized holiday with? Awww. No really, 
were happy for you. Here are some movies you 
can watch while cuddling up with that cutie you 
managed to snag. Props to you.
5. Wedding Crashers: You know this was your 
guilty pleasure over the summer. Sure, its a little 
raunchy, but everyone loves a happy ending.
4, Love Actually: Urn, sorry guys. This ones for 
the girls, as it stars the yummy Hugh Grant. If it 
makes you feel any better, theres nudity. But not 
Hughs. Damn contract clauses.
3. The Princess Bride: Princesses. Pirates. 
Dueling. Rodents of Unusual Size. Doesnt sound 
overly romantic? Buttercup and Wesley will 
change your mind.
2. Mallrats: Join T.S. and Brodie as they try to win 
back their true loves and foil their enemies. Hilarity 
ensues when they all end up on a dating show 
gone horribly wrong. And Ben Affleck gets his ass 
kicked... what more could you possibly want?
1. Grease: Clean-cut Sandy and bad-boy Danny 
made it. They even flew away in a seriously 
red-hot car. Who says there isnt any hope for a 
CS/voice major coupling?
Whether youre alone on Valentines Day or have 
someone to share it with, just remember: The 
Tartan loves you. Especially if you tell us how 
pretty we are. Often.

Prom nights over
Its time to re-evaluate what you think you know about sex and virginity
"You realize were all going to go to college as virgins. They 
probably have special dorms for people like us.
These are the nervous words of Jim Levenstein, Jason Biggs 
memorable adolescent character in the 1999 blockbuster 
American Pie. Its safe to say that the majority of today's 
college students saw this movie. Moreover, they saw it 
while young and impressionable. In case you (as a Carnegie 
Mellon student-to-be) were too busy playing with algorithms 
or composing symphonies, the plot is as follows: Four high 
school seniors vow to have sex by prom night. Hilarity  and 
awkward teenage moments  ensue.
Whats the point? Lets try to figure out how this movie fits 
into the general collegiate perception of sex. While we were 
wrapped up in the whips and scorns of high school and junior 
high, you have to wonder: Where did we really learn about 
sex?
In school? Well, its likely that the experiences of most 
Carnegie Mellon students are varied, as the debate over sex 
education in public schools has been going on for years.
The wants of Americans are divided. Some consider it the 
job of sex-ed classes to promote abstinence and gloss over 
contraceptive methods. Others support the "abstinenceplus system, where abstinence is encouraged but students 
still leam about other ways to prevent pregnancy. And a 
third group doesn't want abstinence to be a significant part 
of the curriculum, which they insist should instead focus 
on condoms and other contraceptives. As of a 2004 study 
conducted by National Public Radio, these groups consist 
of 15, 46, and 36 percent of the population, respectively;
however, a surprising 30 percent of public schools sponsor 
abstinence, while 47 percent teach abstinence-plus and 20 
percent primarily cover methods of contraception.
With that in mind, its no surprise that not all products of 
the American educational system are on the same page 
about sex. But lets not be concerned with our disparities in 
learning; lets talk about what unites us.
Which brings us back to American Pie. Maybe your middle 
school and that of your roommate differed in their conventions 
of sex-ed, but youve probably both seen this movie. And 
amidst the sub-plots concerning foreign exchange students 
and tales of band camp, American Pie has one major theme: 
the concept of virginity.
Most college students subscribe to the American Pie 
definition of virginity, which can be broken into two parts. 
First, you lose your virginity after having vaginal intercourse. 
Though some of the films characters wound up waiting to 
have sex, most managed to do the deed. Thus, the second 
part of the definition of virginity is that its a good thing to lose 
before college. Remember when it seemed that simple?
As it turns out, virginity isnt so cut-and-dried. There are 
many different definitions and interpretations of what it 
means to be a virgin. The American Pie definition doesnt 
apply to everyone: Gays and lesbians whove never engaged 
in vaginal intercourse often consider their virginity lost after 
another landmark, such as a first orgasm or the first time 
they engage in anal or oral sex. And another definition of 
virginity does not see its loss as something that is necessarily
permanent. Some people claim to be bom-again virgins aftei 
taking a belated vow of celibacy.
On top of that, not all virgins are the same. In her book, 
Virginity Lost: An Intimate Portrait of First Sexual 
Experiences, Laura M. Carpenter categorizes virgins into 
three groups: gifters, stigmatized, and processors. And here 
is where we have to give American Pie a little credit. Gifters 
typically wait to have sex until they are assured that the 
experience will be special, magical, maybe even perfect. Tara 
Reids character Vicky is a good example  in the movie she 
wants to have "perfect sex with her boyfriend, Kevin. The 
stigmatized, however, can hardly wait to lose their virginity. 
Almost everyone has felt like the four lead males of American 
Pie at one time or another: burdened by inexperience. And 
finally, the processors are perhaps the wisest of the three 
categories. They see virginity loss as a part of maturity; 
they're not in a rush to lose it or concerned with saving it 
forever. Maybe this is Chris Kleins character Oz, who remains 
a virgin as the credits roll but doesnt sweat it.
You may wonder why were talking so much about virginity 
when so many college students have already had sex. Well, 
none of us have thought about it as much as we probably 
should have. If you dont understand how you interpreted sex 
and virginity while you were a virgin, how can you expect to 
make any sexually related decisions n the present? So, which 
category were  or are  you?

This is simply one of the greatest 
horror films you could ever 
see. Anthony Hopkins plays 
an imprisoned cannibal named 
Hannibal Lecter, who is assisting 
Jodie Fosters character Clarice 
Starling in catching a serial killer. 
The movie does everything 
just right. Hopkins brilliantly 
executes Lecters perfectly sinister 
demeanor, and Foster has that 
naive southern charm central to 
her role. Really, though, this praise 
only begins to speak on the merits 
of this flick. Seriously. Go see it.
Persona
Thursday, February 16 
8, 10,12
Persona tells of an actress who, in 
the very middle of a performance, 
decides to shut up. She just stops 
talking and refuses to interact with 
the world around her through voice. 
Director Ingmar Bergman never 
explicitly explains why the actress 
stops speaking, and the majority 
of this story involves the actress 
and her nurse living together alone 
for a long period of time. Their 
interactions seem blunt and easy 
enough to interpret. However, 
the film suggests much deeper 
meaning as the nurse talks and 
talks while the actress will not say 
a word. Weakness and strength 
oppose each other in a dialectic 
that will give you a lot of food for 
thought.
Jarhead
Friday, February 17 
10,12:30
Remember the Gulf War? Maybe 
not, because too many of us at 
that age preferred cartoons like the 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to 
the news, where cameras caught 
the war unfolding. Jarhead stars 
Jake Gyllenhaal as a character 
based off of a soldier named 
Anthony Swofford, whose memoir 
formed the basis for this movie.
He and his fellow marines have 
gone halfway across the world to 
participate in the glory of battle 
and are met with crumbs to 
clean up. Detailing the insanity 
of inaction, the story tells of the 
war through barracks and mess 
halls, and in a poignant way, it 
transcends the normal war movie.
Harry Potter and the 
Goblet of Fire
Saturday, February 18 
10,1
Mike Newell took the reins in 
this latest installment of the film 
version of the world-famous 
Harry Potter series, and, finally, 
he and his team got Harry Potter 
right. Harry is growing up, and 
so are his dangers. The text-toscreen transition works very well, 
and the atmosphere that Newell 
creates emphasizes the fact 
that this installment is where the 
series loses its innocence. Patrick 
Doyle scored the music this time 
. instead of John Williams, and he 
does an excellent job in giving the 
soundtrack new life. Oh, and by 
the way, Voldemort is back.
Sid and Nancy
Sunday, February 19 
8, 10, 12
This film could have gone and 
detailed the dramatic story of the 
Sex Pistols, but instead director 
Alex Cox details the self-destruction 
of the bands bassist and his 
ladyfriend. This is a very long, 
very depressing story of death.
The rotting lives of the two lovers 
plays out agonizingly before our 
paradoxically sympathetic and 
unsympathetic eyes. We can tell 
that through their vices Sid and 
Nancy will never reach redemption, 
but it pains us to see their downfall. 
If you want a cheery film for you 
and your date, find something else!

Spread the word: Pick-up lines suck
Two investigative journalists find out the hard way
"The word of the day is legs.  Lets get together and 
spread the word." Chances are, if youve heard this, you've 
smacked someone. Pick-up lines... do they actually work?
No. If youve had success with a line, your target was either 
drunk or inanimate. Most lines you hear are one step up from 
vocal pornography, and thats not cool with the ladies (or 
gentlemen). In fact, I think there is a category called vocal 
pornography, but you're not Ron Jeremy, and your target is 
not Anna Nicole Smith.
Over the past week, investigative journalists Justin Brown 
and Michelle Bova (your intrepid authors) have gone in the 
field for you, the reader. We have found what works and, more 
often than that, what does not work. Here we'll share some 
highlights (like the magazine for little kids).
Michelle:
Art boy, in one of my writing classes, wearing the Ninja 
Turtles T-shirt. I jump on the opportunity to guide him to 
Baker basement for coffee when he asks our professor where 
he can get a cup of joe Hes a nice boy. Black hair. Scruffy. 
This is how I like my men. But just as Im about to try to 
launch into some line about how I love the way form works as 
an expression of feeling  or some crap like that  his arty 
(female) friend comes running over. First of all, shes blonde. 
Second of all, shes arty. Isn't it always obvious? She not only 
runs over, but hugs him as well. Why are they hugging? Have 
they, like, not seen each other since the last time they drew 
cubes together in studio? I figure my chances are blown, 
but then Michelangelo comes scurrying behind me in Baker.
I want to  I try to  come up with something original. I 
settle for absent-mindedly brushing his arm as we chat. I try 
to smile at him in class. Come on  a line, my kingdom for 
a line! No. He smiles back sometimes; a cute scruff forms 
around his lips as they curve. But I lose all nerve. Class is over; 
Ive struck out. Mudville cries.
Justin:
Cute Asian girl in my math class! After staring at her. 
awkwardly for a while, I tell her my limit as sex approaches 
infinity is her. She stabs me in the eye with her pencil. I cry 
blood.
As you can see, even attempting to use a line will end in 
crying. But there is hope  we've got some sweet tips for you 
to get some this weekend.
We've seen conversation starters work with a lot more 
success than actual pick-up lines." While they can still be 
awkward, they are less likely to offend the other person. If you 
want to imply more without speaking it, you can use body 
innuendo" to get your point across. Its sometimes a touch 
creepy (no pun intended), but so are most folks at Carnegie 
Mellon, so cut your losses.
View the difference in a simple exchange pre- and post-body 
language:
Pre-Body Language: Hey Samantha, are you having trouble 
with your Calc homework? Yeah? So am I! You wanna work on 
it together sometime? Yeah? Great!"
Post-Body Language: Hey Samantha, (lean in 
conspiratorially) are you having trouble with your Calc 
homework? Yeah?" (touch shoulder sympathetically) So am I! 
You wanna work on it together sometime?" (hand on wrist, on 
the word together") Yeah? Great!" (smile big, maybe if she 
seems into it you should try another small touch, like at the 
shoulder again).
See, now the girl gets the point. Were not talking differential 
equations, were talking chemical reactions. Pheromones, 
baby. Just make sure you dont smell bad.
Another hint: Be more direct without using a line. If youre 
trying to pick up a girl or a guy and they seem into it, dont 
mince words. After this body language exchange, if Samantha 
kicks up the flirt-o-meter you should slip her an even more 
obvious hint at your calculus meeting. Why not tell her how 
kind she is for helping you with a problem? Sometimes your 
target wont catch a hint. You might want to ask if shes 
seeing anyone. You have to be brave. No one likes a man 
without action. And, of course, women traditionally have an 
easier time getting a guy to pay attention to them, but women 
often need to be more forthright. You wont get the attention 
from the right guys if you don't take the initiative. Do you 
really want to spend your whole life with a guy named Bubba?
No pick-up lines. Remember, practice makes perfect. If at first 
you don't succeed, try again. And again. A few pencils in the 
eye, a few arty erection deflections, and youll get the hang 
of it. Just try to seem as sincere as possible, even if you dont 
mean it. You cant always get what you want,-but if you try 
sometimes, you just might find that youll get what you need. 
And what you need is love. I mean sex. I mean... you get it. 
Happy Valentine's Day. Now go get 'em, tiger.

Carnegie Mellon sex culturewhere is it?
And why arent condom sales going up? Oh, wait...
The banner hangs, awaiting those groups of prospective 
students touring the sloped hallway of Baker. When the 
naive high-school seniors arent giving you hot eye-sex in 
an attempt to get a feel" for the kind of students who go 
to Carnegie Mellon, they catch a glimpse of just one of our 
schools acclaimed accolades. Large enough to make any 
Kinkos employee salivate like Pavlovs dogs, the Porter Hall 
banner proclaiming Carnegie Mellon to be the FOURTH 
BEST INSTITUTION TO STUDY METAPHYSIACTICAL 
ENGINEERING NORTH OF THE WEST VIRGINIA 
PANHANDLE (or something like that) is evidence that, yes, 
we go to a good school.
But what do we make of the fact that more kids here would 
get all hot and bothered over the latest U.S. News rankings 
than the sultry economics major looking for a little homework 
help?
Please, youre thinking, not another one of those if-CMU-werea-human-it-would-be-a-cold-blooded-eunuch arguments. Im
sick of hearing about how undersexed, underdressed, and 
underestimated this Tartan town is.
Who isn't? Every college guide to our fine institution just has 
to mention that unproven Playboy investigation that ranked 
us as the ugliest school in the country. It's time we brought to 
attention the bustling world of ecstasy and erotica  not only 
alive, but thriving  here at the 15289 ZIP code.
Take, for instance, Professor Alan Kennedys Rhetoric of 
Fiction course (76-377, or for those of you living in the 
numbers world, 101111001). Just the other day the discussion 
turned downright naughty while exploring Jonathan Swift's 
agenda in his decision to name a character in Gulliver's 
Travels the Good Master Bates. Classic 17th-century 
allusions to self-pleasure! Saucy!
Or just ask the friendly safe-sex proponents down at Health 
Services. Condom sales are up, up, up! Actually, we sell less 
than youd think, the front desk attendant explained. Less
Violinists are sexy too!
Let them stroke at your heart strings
Pop music has Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Beyonce 
Knowles, and Jessica Simpson. Hollywood has Cameron Diaz 
and Jessica Alba. Classical music has Janine Jansen.
Wait, who?
What does Janine Jansen have to do with the other 
distinguished individuals listed above?
Pop culture isnt the only area of public interest that is  
susceptible to the irresistible combination of beauty 
and talent. Spears is not only a sex symbol, but also an 
accomplished pop singer who sold over 55 million albums. 
Diaz, one of the sexy super-spies in Charlie's Angels, has been 
nominated for a Golden Globe award four times.
The beautiful violinist Janine Jansen, only 21, already has 
a burgeoning career in Europe and is making her debut 
American tour with stops in San Francisco, Cleveland, and 
Pittsburgh (at Heinz Hall this May). She has garnered rave 
reviews from The Financial Times, The Independent, and The 
Guardian. Her early recordings have been enthusiastically 
received  she can certainly play the violin.
While not quite as overtly sexual as Britney Spears or Jessica 
Alba, Jansen is still very attractive. Beneath the clothes, so to 
speak, what is it that makes people like Britney Spears and 
Jessica Alba so attractive?
Youth is a big part of it. Pop culture is heavily sponsored by 
the young crowdfrom middle school through college (just 
watch a half hour of MTVs programming). Remember all the 
criticism of Britney Spears for influencing girls who werent 
old enough for Spears racy image? It makes sense that young 
people respond to attractive pop icons close to their own age.
A lot of Jansens youth and vitality comes through in her 
violin playing, which is gloriously beautiful. She and people 
like Spears and Alba exude youth and energy, molten passion
before it solidifies into rock. It was a natural choice for Jansen 
to record Vivaldi's high-octane Four Seasons.
Another attractive quality is simply talent. Many would 
debate the actual talent of Britney Spears, so lets select, 
another example  Jennifer Connelly, whose acting 
prowess garnered an Oscar for A Beautiful Mind in 2002.
Part of Connelly's appeal is her extraordinary acting abilities. 
Ordinary people find it very interesting to watch extraordinary 
people at work. Hence, concertgoers won't be going to 
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in May just to look at 
Jansen; they want to hear her play, too. They want to be in 
the presence of something powerful, something beyond their 
ability to create themselves.
In the world of classical music, there is a category of 
crossover" groups; perhaps most notable among them is 
the group Bond. Groups like these take classical pieces and 
update them (such arrogance!), often by playing on electric 
string instruments rather than genuine ones. In any event, 
this particular group is as overtly sexual as Britney Spears and 
the like. Just take a look at the bare midriffs, shoulders, and 
thighs on the glamorous cover of one of their albums.
Beauty and talent together are a powerful combination. 
Having one or the other can make one famous, but having 
both of these qualities makes a performer especially 
attractive. Janine Jansen, for one, undoubtedly has both.
Matthew E. Campbell | Copy Staff
Above right: Bond 
Right: Janine Jansen
than we'd think? So, like... none? The employee also verified 
that there has never been a line of people awaiting condom 
purchases.
Don't make hasty conclusions, though! Turn to the alwayshandy Facebook for the real deal. A whole 189 people at 
Carnegie Mellon have proclaimed their adoration for the dirty 
deed by joining the I Love Sex group. Just think  this 
doesnt even include the people who really, really like sex, 
or find sex to be an occasional "filler," or the people who cry 
afterward! We're maniacs!
And for those Carnegie Mellon kiddos who enjoy a whackin' 
Wednesday more often then a fornicatin' Friday, keep your 
pants on. This academic castration is working out well for us. 
I mean, weve got banners and everything.

Sex and the art of TMI
still dont want to know what you did last night
Whoa, way too much information! 
Ew gross, man! "If you say one 
more word, I'm going to vom all 
over you." If you've ever said these things, youve 
probably been a victim of TMI.
What is TMI, you ask? Simply put, it means too much 
information, but there are many forms in which this 
blasphemous communication can personify itself. (Note: 
Discussions below mainly pertain to males. Females will be 
covered at the end. Get your mind out of the gutter.)
The blatant TMI
This is a conversation that will make even babies blush
 babies who don't understand English. A blatant TMI 
conversation will include lots of vulgar terms, with hand 
motions and suggestive facial expressions to boot. The 
offender is usually someone sleazy, like the Fonz without any 
class. Well call him Fo." Either Fos mother was a five-cent 
prostitute who talked in appendages, or Fo suffers from a 
severe lack of self-esteem and respect. Either way, don't get 
caught in a conversation with Fo. Best escape response: 
That's gross, which is why your sister liked it last night."
The artistic TMI
Unless youve passed at least a 100-level English course, 
you wont understand what this sex poet is talking about.
But if you have, youll wish you hadnt. The sex poet can be 
the dirtiest of all the TMIers while hiding behind a veil of 
obscurity. Ill give you a few hints. When they talk about their 
godly life-catapult," they arent talking about a trebuchet. 
When they talk about "screaming in euphony so the whole 
world can feel the pulsing glory," they didnt just get an A in 
music class. Best escape response: Wow, youre almost as 
good as John Mayer!
The awkward/CS TMI
This is the person that you do not want to hear sexual talk 
from. This is the person who starts a sentence with Last 
night I... only to send people running. You dont know 
whether to feel creeped out or sorry for them, but what you 
do know is that you feel sick. If you stick around, be prepared 
for allusions to strange movies from the '60s and computer 
components. Best escape response: "Wait, I heard that you 
agreed with Sonys DRM rootkit.
The couple TMI
The Lovers from SNL. STFU OMFG.
The old guy TMI
Old people dont have sex... old people dont have sex..." No 
matter how fervently you cover your ears and repeat this to 
yourself, there will be that old guy who reminds you what 
really happens. I had several old substitute teachers in high 
school who would just love to remind us kids that old people 
are still rowdy in the sack. There is no escape response, 
because you have to respect your elders, but after youre done 
shuddering, its fun to laugh about.
The nice to meet you TMI
I know, it sounds outrageous. Someone introducing 
themselves with an over-the-top sexual story? Trust me, it 
has happened. It is not a good idea to meet someone new 
by telling them you have trouble getting it up with your 
girlfriend. Not only will they probably call the police, they 
wont be too keen on talking to you again, either. If youre 
going to talk sex with someone, make sure it's at least 
someone whose name you know. Best escape response: Let 
me try!" (Please... dont actually say that.)
The TMI to impress TMI
The most common, and the most irritating, of all TMIs. This 
one is not even funny to look back on. Many guys are guilty 
of this, and its disgusting. He shares grotesque stories of him 
and his hot girlfriend just because he thinks hes more of a 
man than you. Exaggeration is his forte. Just find peace in the 
fact that he will probably die lonely, and has very low self
esteem. Do not try to compete with his stories: you will only 
become more like him. Best escape response: I dont care.
In the end, committing an act of TMI is kind of like smoking
 it's forcing other people to indulge in something theyd 
really rather not, and it's just plain rude. Its good to assume 
that if someone asks, they want to know, and if they don't, 
they dont. But even when someone wants to know, they 
dont want details. Practice safe-sex talk  use the base 
system: first base is making out, second base is groping and 
basic hand stuff, third base is oral sex, and a home run is 
sex. Using grand slam" is quickly approaching that line you 
shouldn't cross, so use it with caution.
Now a note on girls and TMI. Being a guy, I have only my 
experience to go on; I have no idea what theyre really 
thinking. Girls are very two-faced when it comes to TMI. They 
dont appreciate when their boyfriends tell all their friends 
about their private sex lives. Winnie sure didnt appreciate it 
when Kevin let the guys in the locker room think they had sex. 
Its completely understandable. But then when that same girl 
tells her girlfriends things at a random sleep-over party even 
when the guy had never said anything, or when that same girl 
tells a friend of hers things about the relationship that would 
make the guy blush if he ever heard... thats just ridiculous! 
Girls need to leam that the other point of not sharing too 
much information is because its private, and personal, 
and doesnt need to be discussed with anyone outside the 
relationship. And you especially dont need to talk about that 
one time I took my shirt off with people that you dont even 
know, because maybe I'm uncomfortable with my shirt off and 
maybe that was just between you and me!
Talking about sex with someone you're very comfortable with 
can be healthy. Talking about relationships in which you're 
not comfortable to someone else is more than okay, because 
you should tell someone. But sharing sexual details with plain 
old friends is not acceptable. Do the world a favor and stop 
publicly exposing yourself.

Some people enjoy a post-coital doze; others indulge in a cigarette. This 
week you will meet a boy who finishes his business, scrambles out of 
bed, and cools his nerves with a stomping round of DDR. Actually, youll 
find it kind of sexy. Except that he jiggles...
You are a connoisseur of sex, a jack-of-all-positions. But be wary of the 
Skibo Squat. It will take a team of chiropractors three hours to remove 
your little toe from her ear.
If you get a computer virus from an Internet porn site, does that count 
as an STD?
Your blood runs cold as you realize the baseball interlude in Meat Loaf's 
Paradise by the Dashboard Light isnt really about baseball at all. 
Some girl is about to have sex. In a car. With Meat Loaf.
Remember in elementary school, when girls and boys would chase 
each other around the playground to show that they liked one another? 
Its not like that anymore. Instead of a playground, its Pittsburgh. And 
chasing elementary school girls  literally chasing them down  is 
way scary and illegal. You will be arrested and forbidden from living in 
a school zone ever again.
Trust me: when your girlfriend suggests spicing up your sex life with 
some titillating edibles, dont buy reduced-fat chocolate syrup. Shell 
take it the wrong way.
Things are not going well with your voice major boyfriend. Remember 
the immortal wisdom of Journey: Lovin a music man aint always what 
its sposed to be.
You will suddenly realize how suggestive all those ones and zeroes are, 
and never again will you be able to work in binary without getting all 
hot and bothered.
Remember, no matter how lonely you get this Valentines Day, you 
will only feel worse about yourself the morning after pulling your Josh 
Groban poster down into bed with you.
Today you will realize with delight that the phrase butt cuddle is 
assonant.
This week, your grandma will learn how to use the Internet, and during 
her inaugural AIM conversation, you will accidentally write CUM 
instead of "CMU." There will be a misunderstanding with Grandpa.
No, you cannot make money by taking your roommates trashcan full 
of wadded-up tissues to the sperm bank. For starters, thats gross. 
Moreover, I had a cold, you jerk.
