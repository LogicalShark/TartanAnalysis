autonomous vehicles crossed the finish line in a

finished just behind the Stanford Racing Team, which 
had the fastest time, clocking in at 6:53:58.
The Stanford team, ironically, has many CMU con
nections: Team leader Sebastian Thrun is a former 
computer science professor at CMU. Several CMU 
grads, including Michael Montemerlo, a former Ph.D. 
student under Whittaker, are on the team as well.
There are plenty of my students and our [CMU] 
grads that are part of the culture and in lots of these 
teams, Whittaker said. In a lot of ways, no matter 
who wins, I win.
Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research 
Project Agency (DARPA), the Grand Challenge sought 
to bring together the brightest minds to create the 
first fully autonomous vehicles that could cross miles 
of off-road terrain successfully. The first challenge 
in took place in the Mojave Desert in 2004, with 
disappointing results. None of the teams finished the 
race, though CMUs entry, Sandstorm, traveled the 
farthest: 7.36 miles.
This year saw CMU return a veteran, entering Red 
Team with Sandstorm, and a second team, Red Team 
Too, with Highlander.
Carnegie Mellons vehicles performed exception

Skibo to Open; All Facilities Will Be Complete to Answer Long-Felt Need
by H. Russell Bintzer
Vice-President, Carnegie Tech 
Published December 7,1960
The new Skibo will answer a need 
long felt on the Carnegie Tech campus: 
one building in which all student ac
tivities can be conducted. It will serve 
more than 3400 full-time and 
almost 2000 part-time students, in 
addition to the faculty and staff.
One of the highlights of the new build
ing is the beautiful new ball room on 
the first flo'or. Large pillars, in two rows, 
decorate the center of the room. At one 
end of the ball room is a stage that can be 
made larger or smaller for a bandstand. 
The room can accommodate approxi
mately 400 couples. The ball room can 
be used for banquets, parties, dances and 
dinners. There is a projector in the room,
so that it can be used to show movies.
When the ball room is not in use for 
a special affair it is a lounge area. Next 
to the ball room is a lobby which can be 
used as an addition to the ball room or as 
a separate room. Between the ball room 
is a service entry to be used when there 
are dinners and refreshments in the ball 
room.
Also on the first floor is an all-purpose 
room. This room, equipped with a projec
tor, will accommodate 150-200 people. 
There is a stage at one end of the room.
Eating facilities
Many different eating facilities are lo
cated in the new Skibo. On the first floor 
is a snack bar. The snack bar is for use 
between meals while the staff is cleaning 
the cafeteria. Next to the stack bar is 
located a faculty lounge, a faculty dining
room, and a Presidents dining room. 
There are three private dining rooms for 
the use of any private student or faculty 
groups.
Beside the snack bar is a game room. 
On the second floor there is a room 
with tables for cards and other games. 
Ping pong also may occupy leisure hours.
Club Rooms & Offices
One-half of the ground floor contains 
club' rooms and offices. The Tartan, the 
Scot, The Technical, and the Thistle will 
have private offices. WRCT, the campus 
radio station, will have a new waiting 
room. There are darkrooms for the use of 
photography staffs. The seven club and 
committee rooms may be used by any of 
the campus organizations. Each sorority 
will have a closet outside the club rooms. 
The Poster room will provide a place for
organizations to work on their advertise
ments. The Student Congress has a meet
ing room, and will decide the future of 
the Student Activity Room.
Use of the Rooms
The use of the rooms in Skibo will 
be handled by Dean Strict. The comple
tion of the new Skibo will mark an
other step forward in Carnegies ten-year 
$29,000,000 development program.
Note to CIT Students
Skibo  the all new Skibo  was 
dedicated 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, No
vember 20. And less than 100 of Techs 
3500 students were present!
Many, many volunteers worked long 
hours to raise $2.9 million dollars to 
build Skibo for you. Some of them took
time away from their basic responsibili
ties to attend this dedication.
And they saw less than 100 Tech stu
dents in attendance!
But they did see students streaming 
by Skibo on their way to the dorms and 
fraternities. They did see young men 
tossing a football back and forth right 
outside Skibo. So unavailability or lack 
or time cannot account for this breach of 
good manners; this failure to say thanks 
by your presence there.
Im puzzled and ashamed. Gan any of 
you explain to me why less than 100 of 
you would appear for the dedication of 
a campus activities center that basically 
is yours  that is one of the finest youll 
find on any campus of a size comparable 
to Techs. Will the same disinterest  the 
same poor showing  occur when we 
dedicate the $3.5-million-dollar Hunt 
Library next year? I hope not.

Letter to the Editor: Bill of RightsTechs Tuition Will Increase to $600
Students Now Paying Only 50% of Education CostPublished April 8,1959 
Editor, The Tartan:
In a battle between Pittsburghs 
finest and the Bill of Rights, I 
am sorry to report that freedom 
placed a poor second.
In the latter part of the 18th 
century it was by no mere 
accident, by no legislative inad
vertence, that the Constitution of 
the United States was amended 
so as to include the Bill of Rights
 the prime preserver of our 
individual and civil liberties.
Because our forefathers accu
rately foresaw the events in the 
future that might sink the ship 
of state and so made provisions 
which they felt would guaran
tee liberty to the citizenry, our 
country has risen to great rights; 
because, however, they failed 
to contend with the Pittsburgh 
Police Department, the Bill of 
Rights is no longer a recital of 
fact, nor does it seem that it even 
contains words of aspiration.
April 1,1959
At 10:30 on April 1, three hun
dred Carnegie Tech students cel
ebrated the advent of spring by 
converging on the girls dormi
tory. After arriving, some from as 
far away as two blocks, 275 stood 
around expending nervous en
ergy by shifting from foot to foot 
while the remaining twenty-five 
valiantly attempted to enter the 
lobby (in which they are allowed 
entrance anyway). Observing

This Tartan reporter asked for 
several student opinions on the 
following question: What do 
you think of panty raids? The 
answers follow:
George Paris: I guess its a 
more direct way for Tech stu
dents to relieve study frustra
tions. Too bad the Pittsburgh 
police force doesnt spend more 
time banging those clubs against 
some of the men of graft in this 
city rather than against a group 
of mostly innocent students.
A1 Walmer, freshman, Archithe proceedings from across 
the street, within the confines 
of their houses, were approxi
mately an additional two hun
dred fraternity men. Suddenly 
the police swooped down and 
everyone dispersed. Not finding 
a sufficient number of willing 
victims, the police then ran into 
the fraternity houses to help fill 
up their quota and emerged with 
a handful of men  not one of 
whom had participated in the 
events of the evening. I was one 
of this handful.
Justice
I am no Diogenes. I do not 
search for truth with a lantern. 
I do, however, expect justice 
from our system of courts. I was 
sitting on the porch of my fra
ternity house  a policeman 
came running up the stairs; he 
grabbed me and dragged me into 
the paddy wagon. Realizing my 
innocence, I attempted no resis
tance. I expected justice.
Later, I was accused of using 
profanity. My arresting officer, 
however, taught me many new 
words I had not heard before. 
I was taken to jail and placed 
in a cell. A drunk was placed 
in the same cell with some of 
the students to the amusement 
of Pittsburghs finest. I was re
leased for $50 bail.
Court
That morning I was arraigned. 
It was the most flagrant violation 
of justice I have ever witnessed. 
If a man is innocent until proven
tecture: We should have more 
of them.
Dick Luppi: I never saw an 
event at this school so well 
attended by the student body. I 
especially think the Pittsburgh 
police put on an excellent display 
of dispersing a potential riot. 
However, I think it would be best 
if they refrained from practicing 
on the student body at Tech. I 
think the twelve arrested have 
learned a lesson  it pays to al
ways be in shape and quick starts 
are necessary in a situation such 
as this. Broken field running 
helps too. Yes sir, quite a show! 
Joy Burrier, Sophomore: It
guilty, then the presiding judge 
was unaware of this. It was sen
tence first, verdict afterwards. 
I was not given the opportunity 
to plead guilty or not guilty. My 
arresting officer was not even 
present at this kangaroo court.
Having been exposed to the 
kind of justice that Pittsburgh 
has to offer, I am sickened by the 
entire matter. If these examples 
of ethical disintegration are still 
in evidence when I graduate and 
enter the engineering world, 
my intention would be never to 
seek employment in the city of 
Pittsburgh. This realization might 
convince me that America, the 
land of the brave and the free, 
home of the tired, the poor, the 
wretched masses yearning to be 
free is just like the Pittsburgh 
that the police department has 
shown it to be.
Sincerely, 
Joel I. Edelman
Editors Note: The Tartan edi
tors sympathize with the plight 
of the writer of this letter, and are 
thankful that they were more-for
tunate front porch spectators. 
While the account of the panty 
raids is probably over-simplified, 
the other parts of the description 
presented are all too true. While 
it is true that college students are 
subject to the law of the land as is 
anyone else, it is also true that the 
methods used by the Pittsburgh 
Police in quelling the disturbance 
would have been more appropri
ate in Tibet. R.G.W.
should have better organization 
and more efficiency. They should 
have more policemen to join in 
the fun.
Charlie Cozewith: I think that 
the panty raid should become an 
annual occurrence and replace 
Spring Carnival because its much 
cheaper and just as much fun
 except for the police.
Bob Gordon: I think panty 
raids give people the opportu
nity to develop leadership, char
acter, and morals. They also are 
good for public relations with 
the community and it calls at
tention to the activities of Tech 
students. Theyre fun, too.

October 21, with the dedication 
of Hamerschlag Hall, Techs new 
freshmen mens dormitory. The 
joint dedication was performed 
by Mrs. Elizabeth E. Hamerschlag 
and President Warner.
The ceremony began with 
a short speech by President 
Warner to the assembled alum

then offered by the Reverend 
Hugh S. Clark of The Church of

in the national economy, but also 
the realization that there is con

History
Mr. Bovard recalled the his

Andrew Carnegie requested 
Mr. Hamerschlag to organize a

Mr. Hamerschlag worked 
quickly and on April 5, 1905, 
Mrs. Hamerschlag turned 
the first spade where Porter 
Hall now stands. During his 
twenty years as president, 
twenty buildings were con
structed and twenty-one depart
ments established on the Tech 
campus.

of Mens Dormitory Council, ex
pressed the pride felt by C.I.T.s 
thirty-five hundred students for 
the beautiful new dormitory.
that students now pay only about 
50 percent of total education 
costs, with the remainder com
ing from endowment, gifts, and 
other non-tuition sources.
Dr. Warner emphasized that 
tuition for the current year will 
remain unchanged. Being a par
ent myself, he said, I know 
family budgets must have a 
chance to adjust, so Carnegie 
has decided to give a years ad
vance notice of this increase. A 
following letter to this effect has 
been sent to each Carnegie Tech 
student and his parents.
this is the first time Carnegie 
Mellon has played a home game

him to hand the game ball to

THE TARTAN  HOMECOMING EDITION  OCTOBER 26, 20055
Letter to the Editor: Hooray for gobbledygook!
Published October 28,1980
Cheers for Mr. Tanzers letter 
decrying the nascent, supercil
ious attitude which The Tartan 
has taken toward the letters 
received. The letters have always 
been the most worthwhile por
tion of the paper. The editor first 
attempts to justify this policy by 
stating that it must ... withhold 
all material that is libelous or 
involves the paper in breaking 
the law. This is, of course, only 
right. But in what dispensation 
has the editor been granted the
infinite wisdom to decide that 
which is not ... concise and to 
the point or becomes ... overly 
long without making a particular 
point...?
Shall CMU never have another 
fruit-vegetable controversy? Shall 
we never again see the endless
bantering about the activities fee 
or the competency of the Student 
Senate? Are these subjects point
less? Possibly they become point
less after some period of time. 
How is this time period to be 
determined  magic incanta
tions, reading the flights of birds?
No indeed! Let no one decide 
what is worthwhile for another! 
Yet The Tartan claims it ...has 
a limited amount of space for 
letters. It certainly has since it 
has begun devoting a page and 
a quarter to editorials. If The 
Tartan is so concerned with
insipid gobbledygook, then let 
them return to their old format
 without the lengthy editorials 
and with two pages of letters.

a lecture before both faculty 
and students of the depart
ment. A letter signed by nine 
architecture faculty members 
was sent to Dean Akram Midani, 
challenging Sauers appoint
ment. The letter stated: We 
are deeply concerned about the 
methods and products of his 
presentation.... We strongly urge 
the Head Search Committee 
to withdraw Mr. Sauers name 
from consideration.
In another letter dated April 
22, to Charles Eastman, Chair
man of the Search Committee, 
15 faculty members charged: 
We were denied any informa
tion, other than hearsay.... We 
were not permitted to endorse or 
withhold endorsement... prior to 
the official offers by the adminis
tration.... We view these proce
dures to be irresponsible....

Controversy surrounding the

over the past two weeks. Stu

gun to organize within design se

decisive action and direction 
on the part of the administra

April, architecture students have 
called for a definitive statement 
regarding the policy and direc
tion of the department under 
Louis Sauer. Sauer has not yet 
responded.
At a meeting of the architec

Sauer failed to discuss issues 
relating to faculty appointments 
and curriculum changes raised in 
last weeks issue of The Tartan.

William ONeill, raised questions 
regarding the selection process. 
In a letter dated April 23, 1979,

lecture of April 18, 1979, and 
the seminar of the following

In summation, I find Mr.

Today is the official opening 
of CMUs Robotics Institute, one 
of the largest and most contro
versial projects ever set up by a 
university.
CMU is presently collaborat
ing with Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation to create and refine 
the factory of the future. Its 
cost: $1.3 million per year. The 
University is also working with 
the U.S. Navy on underwater ex
ploration with robots; negotia
tions are underway with numer
ous industries and government 
agencies to gain support for 
other projects.
Public dedication ceremonies 
are scheduled for 10:30 am in 
Porter Hall 100.
Tentative speakers include sci
entist and television personality 
Carl Sagan, MIT artificial intel
ligence expert Marvin Minsky, 
U.S. Navy Admiral Baciocco, a 
top Westinghouse official and 
one or more of these politicians: 
Governor Richard Thornburgh, 
Senator John Heinz, and Pitts
burgh Mayor Richard Caliguri.
Three major robotics demon
stration labs will be showcased: a 
flexible turbine blade manufac
turing assembly, inserting electri
cal components in printed circuit 
boards, and intelligent manage
ment systems. Numerous other 
demonstrations, such as robot 
sensors which imitate the human 
senses, have been planned.
A staff of over 35 CMU pro
fessionals is currently involved 
in robotics-related research in 
manufacturing science, sensor 
technology, computer science 
and artificial intelligence. Raj 
Reddy, professor of computer sci
ence, is director of the Robotics 
Institute. Daniel Berg and Angel 
Jordan, deans of MCS and CIT
respectively, are also involved in 
coordinating robots.
Other robotics research at 
CMU includes mobile robots, vi
sual sensing through laser optics 
or infrared and other radiation, 
and non-visual sensors  tactile, 
chemical and electrical.
What will be the results of this 
work? In addition to redesigning 
the factory and managing the 
oceans, other projects for the fu
ture could be automated mining, 
nuclear rescue and power plant 
inspection, working in space and 
possible medical applications.
The major benefit of robotics, 
according to CMU officials, 
will be increased productivity 
throughout industry and govern
ment. It is argued that the loss 
of some jobs to robots will be 
more than compensated for by 
increased productivity, new jobs, 
and a decline in the growth of 
Americas working-age popula
tion.
The incredible results of our first annual Personality and Entertainment Omnibus Poll
Article Uncredited 
Published November 4,1980
They came in envelopes, they 
came stapled, they came scotchtaped. In all, a deluge of over 250 
responses to The Tartans First 
Annual Entertainment and Per
sonality Omnibus Opinion Poll 
poured into Tartan headquarters. 
An independent statistician tabu
lated the results, which were then 
presented to the Entertainment 
Editor for analysis.
Definite trends were noted; like 
241 people out of the 262 that re
sponded for favorite actor voted 
for James Dean. This is consid
ered to be an unprecedented case 
of the power of the write-in vote 
(ballot stuffing).
If enthusiasm of this sort can 
be carried over into presidential 
elections, America may get some
one qualified and competent to 
be its next president. Dont start 
holding your breath.
How the Dean Wave affected 
the results in other categories is
The Dean Wave took over the Favorite Actor poll.
unclear. Was the rest of the poll 
completed in earnest by these 
people, or did they simply com
plete the other categories at ran
dom? In an analysis of the ballots, 
The Tartan has decided that the 
other categories were voted on in 
a thoughtful, equitable fashion.
The Tartan wishes to thank 
everyone who participated in 
this poll, and apologizes for any 
misunderstanding that may have 
been caused in certain references 
to women. We obviously do not 
wish physical pain on anyone.
Favorite Movie
An old standard that has 
reached something of a cult sta
tus competed with a modern 
comedy for the votes of Tartan 
readers. When the votes were tal
lied, however, Casablanca with 
29 votes beat out Woody Allens 
Annie Hall, which attracted 24 
votes.
Casablanca is the popular Bogart-Bergman movie that began 
attracting college crowds in the 
late Sixties in a wave of nostalgia. 
It includes the line Heres lookin 
at you, kid, but does not include 
the line Play it again, Sam. 
Bogart, in fact, never said that 
line in a motion picture.
Annie Hall remains Allens most 
successful film, artistically and 
commercially. It won the Acad
emy Award for Best Picture, and 
Diane Keaton won an Oscar for 
Best Actress.
Annie Hall launched a fash
ion trend and popularized the 
phrases Im into leather and 
What an asshole.
The most popular write-in 
choice was East of Eden and the 
least popular choice offered by 
the editors was the cult classic
Harold and Maude.
Here are all the movies receiv
ing at least two votes:
Casablanca 28

Favorite Actor
James Dean was not listed 
among the editors choices. This 
slight did not prevent Tartan 
readers from mailing in over 240 
ballots in his favor. It is hard to say 
how many people were involved 
in the Dean Wave, but there is 
no doubt that he has the same 
fervent following here that he has 
across the rest of the country.
There is a renewed interest in 
Deans movies and Deans life 
since this year marks the 25th an
niversary of his tragic death.

Peter Sellers  2
Jon Voight 2
Actress You Would 
Most Like to See Ripped

The voting came down to a 
choice between a politically 
offensive woman and a no-talent, 
vacuous bimbo. When the chips 
were down, however, Jane Fonda 
with 52 votes edged out Bo Derek, 
who received 49.
Jane Fonda, who spoke at CMU 
last year with her husband, Tom 
Hayden, is still considered by

many Americans to be a traitor for 
lending support to the enemy in 
the Vietnam War. She is generally 
considered to have a big mouth.
Bo Derek is known by many 
Tartan readers as an untalented, 
empty-headed bore who by the 
determination of her Svengali 
husband, John Derek, lucked into 
a major movie role.

GSIA publication censored
GSIA students William Frey and Les Fisher discuss the censorship issue with The Tartan.
by Lori Zuti
Published October 7,1980
Moments before printing, an 
article in the September 26 is
sue of Robber Barrons, a GSIA 
student publication, was removed 
from the paper by the GSIA ad
ministration.
The authors, Les Fisher and 
William Frey, both second year 
students at GSIA, feel that the 
administration censored the 
article, violating their student 
rights as defined in the student 
handbook.
According to the handbook, 
Every student has the constitu
tional rights and responsibilities 
of any citizen under the law, 
which includes the First Amend
ment speech rights. Violation of 
these constitutes a breach of con
tract between the University and 
the students.
Yet, according to GSIA Dean 
Robert Kaplan, the article was
pulled because we wanted to be 
sure the article had received the 
proper attention from the editor.
Robber Barrons has no offi
cial editorial policy, but accord
ing to Vicki Falco, Director of 
Admissions and Student Affairs 
for GSIA, we have an unwritten 
editorial policy in which anything 
submitted that either the editor or 
I feel is questionable, personally 
insulting, or harmful in any way, 
may be pulled and discussed. 
She added, though, that the edi
tor has the final word.
However, the editor, Ross Tokmakin, had received the article 
Thursday afternoon and had ap
proved the article for publication.
Friday afternoon after the pa
per was set to print, both Falco 
and Tokmakin left the building 
along with the authors, Fisher 
and Frey.
According to Jan Peterson, As
sociate Director of Placement and 
Staff Development, a student 
who thought the article was ob
jectionable brought it to me. Al
though Peterson has no authority 
over this student-run newspaper, 
she said that The decision was 
made by me ... because no one 
else was around.
Dean Kaplan said that he is also 
taking responsibility for pulling 
the article, claiming that the ar
ticle was not done in good taste. 
I dont want the paper as a 
place for ad hominem attacks, 
he added.
Yet according to the Dean, this 
was the first time he had seen 
an article in advance and that 
he usually relies on the editor to 
make those decisions.
The result of this is a draft of 
an editorial policy, said Dean Ka
plan. It was just an unfortunate 
set of circumstances, he added.
The authors, Fisher and Frey, 
describe their article as a sarcas
tic piece and also as a piece of 
criticism concerning professor 
Allen Meltzers method of teach
ing.

both programs; she was hired in 
November 1999 to take control of 
the BHA program and spearhead 
BSAs rollout, as well. Maurides 
has a long history at CMU  she 
attended as a graduate student, 
and earned her MFA, here in art.
Maurides has always been 
aware of the interdisciplinary op
tions at Carnegie Mellon. When 
I was a graduate student, some
thing that was celebrated was in
terdisciplinary thinking and prac
tice, and I think its just been re
vealed more and nurtured more. 
But it was always part of the soul 
of Carnegie Mellon, which is why 
Ive been here for so long, she 
said with a chuckle.
Though the two programs are 
under the same director, they 
each have their own curricula 
determined by the individual 
schools. While neither program is 
a true double major, the students 
are expected to take a wide vari
ety of classes in each school.
They come to Carnegie Mellon 
as citizens of two colleges, 
Maurides said. However, the BHA 
program requires even more. 
Students in the BHA program are 
required either to complete some 
kind of project that merges the 
two fields they are studying, or 
to justify their reason for study
ing both fields with plans for the 
future.
The project requirement for 
BHA has led to students accom
plishing very impressive things. 
They know what they want, and 
my job is to push some of the bu
reaucracy out of the way so that 
they can do that, Maurides said.
Jeff Walsh, a BSA student 
who focused on biology and 
architecture, led a team of art,
design, and biology majors to 
study how hospital room design 
at the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center and influenced 
the rate at which patients recov
ered. Graduate Kathleen Agres 
used the BHA program to help 
her study music therapy at the 
Hillman Cancer Center, and she 
received a grant from the National 
Institute of Mental Health for an
other project.
The unique potential of BHA
I think we are so 
way ahead of the 
curve.... 
Patricia Maurides
and BSA students is apparent to 
Harriet Schwartz the programs 
career consultant. I think all 
Carnegie Mellon students are 
motivated, Schwartz said, but 
this bunch seems to be extraor
dinarily motivated, and I think 
incredibly self-directed.
Theyre very passionate about 
ideas, theyre very curious, and 
then they have the more practical 
abilities to pursue those interests 
in a more independent way than 
you would if you were just follow
ing a more standard curriculum.
Carnegie Mellon has always 
claimed that it championed inter
disciplinary study as a university. 
However, until recently, there 
had been little evidence to back 
that stance up. Maurides believes 
the BHA and BSA programs are 
prime examples of CMU finally 
making good on its promises.
I think we are so way ahead of 
the curve, Maurides said. BHA 
has been around since 93, and 
I think we are now beginning to 
see seedlings of other programs 
at other universities. I think the 
people who put together the BHA 
were visionaries, and you can see 
that now at other universities 
trying to develop programs. The 
challenge is always in advising, 
and that you need to have a home 
for the students.
Luckily the small number of stu
dents who join the BHA/BSA pro
gram every year makes it easy for 
program administrators to keep 
a close eye on them. Maurides 
believes that this is probably the 
strongest feature of the BHA/BSA 
program.
When you have a program 
that crosses different colleges, it 
cant be the students who are go
ing back and forth on that bridge; 
they need to have an advocate, 
they need to have a director, an 
advisor  a home, or things can 
be lost. It seems pretty self-evi
dent, she said.
The BHA/BSA program isnt 
the only interdisciplinary curric
ulum track that Carnegie Mellon 
offers. Under a new director this 
year, the Science and Humanities 
Scholars program takes incom
ing students and gives them a 
unique college experience. The 
program ensures that the stu
dents take classes in both science 
and humanities, and it works to 
create a tightly-knit group of stu
dents who grow up together at 
Carnegie Mellon.
William Alba, the SHS pro
grams new director, is very 
quickly settling into the position. 
The entry process of SHS is dif
ferent from that of BHA or BSA, 
he said. First-years from both the 
humanities and science schools 
are offered entry into the pro
gram, after which they are as
signed group housing on the fifth 
floor of New House. They have 
extra general education require
ments on top of those required 
by their major; because of this,
SHS students often end up tak
ing many of the same classes to
gether.
The SHS program takes a dif
ferent approach to education 
than the BHA and BSA programs. 
Rather than guiding students 
down a path toward multidis
ciplinary projects like the BHA 
program, SHS lets students form 
their education without stress
ing a need to combine disciplines 
together.
They form a nice tight com
munity of scholars; they study 
together, they form friendships, 
and that first-year experience liv
ing together reverberates through 
the years. And in effect, what the 
university has done  and Im '
not sure if this is by design or 1
not  but in fact what its done 
is create a residential college, 
said Alba.
Alba sees a long way to go for in
terdisciplinary study at Carnegie 
Mellon. There is a quirk of the 
University that we want students 
to be interdisciplinary and yet 
we dont have many courses that 
span those disciplines, he says.
For all of Carnegie Mellons 
rhetoric over the years, the 
University is only now really 
starting to capitalize on it  and I

Ever since Andrew Carnegies 
grand institute began its College 
of Fine Arts program early in the 
schools history, the academic 
culture here at CMU has officially 
embraced students yearning to 
expand their horizons. But stu
dents havent always found an 
easy access to interdisciplinary 
education, and departmental 
walls were often hard to scale.
In recent years, though, the 
University has launched several 
programs for students who are 
especially interested in taking a 
multidisciplinary track through 
their college careers.
The Bachelor of Humanities 
and Arts and Bachelor of Science 
and Arts programs, which be
gan in 1993 and 1999 respec

College of Fine Arts, and either 
the Humanities & Social Sciences 
school or the Mellon College of 
Sciences. Each year there are 
only about 20 students accepted 
into the two programs combined; 
when prospective students are 
first applying to Carnegie Mellon, 
they must be accepted to both 
CFA and either H&SS or MCS.
All BHA and BSA students take 
a seminar together in their first 
year, which lets them interact fur

University evicts Pi Lambda Pi; student dies of alcohol poisoning
by Edward Hayes
News Editor
Published February 6,1995
Pi Lambda Phi fraternity must va
cate its house by mid-semester due to 
the tragic death of Justin Chambers on 
December 11.
Michael Murphy, Dean of Student Af
fairs, said, The current residents will 
move from the house by mid-semester. 
These repercussions stemmed from 
Chambers death. He was a second-year 
materials science and engineering stu
dent who died of alcohol poisoning dur
ing a private Christmas party held at 
PiLam before the mid-semester break. 
Chambers, whose blood-alcohol concen
tration was 0.54, was a brother in the 
fraternity.
The move had been speculated for 
some time before Murphy served the 
official eviction notice to the house this 
past week.
The brothers under the age of 21 at
tending the party received internal 
citations for underage drinking, must 
serve 25 hours of community service, 
and are on disciplinary probation for one
year. Brothers over 21 face misdemeanor 
criminal charges for serving alcohol to a 
minor.
Murphy said, The organization will 
still continue to be recognized and will be 
able to participate in Carnival and Greek 
Sing and other student activities. As 
long as they still have their charter, Chris 
Cenkener, president of the Greek Coun
cil, said they will still recognize PiLam. 
Carnegie Mellon cannot remove their 
charter, he said, only their national. 
The national president of PiLam was un
available for comment.
Cenkener expressed his enthusiasm
that PiLam continues to participate in 
student events on campus, I really hope 
they can [participate in Greek Sing and 
Carnival]. It is unknown whether or not 
PiLam will take part in these events. The 
president of the house was unavailable 
for comment.
As of right now there has not been any 
definite determination about who will 
move into PiLams house. For now, the 
brothers are permitted to keep some of 
their belongings in the building for the 
remainder of the semester. Cenkener was 
unsure what would become of PiLams 
house. He did say that it would remain

Senate examines financial misconduct
by Max Chittister
Assistant News Editor 
Published January 30,1995
There was a vote by Student Senate to impeach 
Student Body President Declan McCullagh Tues
day night. The motion to impeach was motivated 
by an unresolved financial situation and the recent 
harassment charges brought against the president 
by Donna Riley and Crystal Trexel. The vote, which 
required a two-thirds majority to pass, failed by a 
vote of 10-10-1.
Immediately after McCullaghs report, Senate 
Treasurer Emma Gosden announced that she had 
frozen the Student Body Presidents account, since 
it was running a deficit. McCullagh defended him
self by stating that he was owed more than $1000 
by various organizations, including the Treasurer 
and Student Senate.
Senate Chair Burt Holzman reminded McCullagh 
that Student Senate had, in fact, paid him back.
The official motion to vote on impeachment was 
made by Merle Atkinson, Funding and Recogni
tion Chair. Atkinson cited several reasons for the 
motion, most of them pertaining to the financial 
situation. Records show that McCullagh took out 
an American Express Corporate Card this past sum
mer. Atkinson was unsure who authorized the card, 
which still showed an outstanding balance.
McCullaghs phone bills were also cited. The 
initial estimate Atkinson made was $450 for one 
semester. Many of them [were made] using the 
American Express card, Atkinson said.
According to Atkinson, McCullagh spent approxi
mately $270 on dinners. No names were given as to 
who the dinners were for.
Student Senate fiscal policy states that recog
nized organizations cannot request funds for food 
and beverages.. However, according to Holzman, 
we. [Senate] suspended fiscal policy.
McCullagh then had the opportunity to pres
ent his case. He found it disgusting Senate would 
stoop to this level.... I can justify every purchase ... 
and [phone] call.
Many of the calls placed were to legal experts 
around the country about the censorship issue.
McCullagh also defended himself against the ha
rassment and abuse charges brought by Riley and
Trexel through the University Committee on Disci
pline (UDC). McCullagh claims he is the latest in a 
long line of victims of his accusers.
McCullagh stated that he was under direction not 
to discuss a majority of the UDC hearing.
After some debate concerning specifics of the fi
nancial situation, Anne Biekle moved to vote.
The motion to vote passed unanimously. The mo
tion to impeach was defeated by a vote of 10 for, 10 
against, and one abstention.
The one abstention was Troy Benowitz, H&SS 
Senator and Human Resources Chair. I thought it 
over and decided both sides were kinda faulty. So I 
abstained, he said.
Atkinson, who voted for impeachment, com
mented on the harassment charges reported in The 
Tartan. [It] made me feel uneasy. Reading the ar
ticle, I was astounded that a plea of guilty was en
tered to a charge of harassment. I am sure there are 
circumstances I am not aware of, but this fact alone 
tells me that I should question myself as to whether 
or not I want him to be the figurehead of our stu
dent body, he said.
Joe DeMasi, an MCS Senator, said, I voted to 
start impeachment proceedings, partly because 
there seems to be a major concern that Declan spent 
funds inappropriately ... If Declan is guilty of this 
harassment charge, I definitely think he should not 
be the leader of the student body. If students dont 
like the actions of Declan, or of Senate, I encourage 
them to contact their Senate representative as soon 
as possible.
Dillon Lin, a CFA Senator, voted against impeach
ment. The assault/harassment issue is being han
dled by a separate authority and could not, in my 
opinion, be handled by Student Government. If he 
is indeed found guilty by that... authority, the issue 
can be brought up in front of Senate again, in my 
... opinion ... the financial issue does not need an 
entire hearing.
Student bylaws state that the President may be 
impeached by a two-thirds vote of Student Senate, 
or by a petition signed by 500 students.
After receiving a request for impeachment, the 
Chair of Student Senate will announce the im
peachment request at the first meeting at least one 
week after the request. A three-fourths vote of the 
Senators present is required to remove the official 
from his or her office.
CMU Student Body President Resigns
by Edward Hayes
News Editor
Published February 20,1995
Student Government President 
Declan McCullagh resigned at an 
emergency meeting of Student 
Senate last Friday. For legal rea
sons, Im announcing my resigna
tion effective next Tuesday, he 
told Senators, faculty, and other 
student leaders in Posner Halls 
Rachel Mellon Walton room.
Following his announcement, 
McCullagh took questions from 
the audience. For legal rea
sons, the questions had to be 
submitted on notecards to Julie 
Harris, McCullaghs associate, 
before he answered them. One 
Senator questioned McCullaghs 
financial problems. Why did 
you circumvent the financial ac
count director to request $50 in 
Campus Express? Why was this 
not brought to the attention of the 
Treasurer, the account director, in 
your face-to-face meeting?
McCullagh responded, I did 
not circumvent the account di
rector so the question is invalid. 
This made reference to the fact 
that McCullagh had reserved the 
Rachel Mellon Walton room for 
the meeting and had to spend 
$50 from his frozen account.
At that point Brenden Mielke, 
Chair of Campus Affairs, distrib
uted handouts showing that Mc
Cullagh had indeed circumvented 
the Treasurer.
McCullagh was also asked if the 
Student Government President 
should be allowed to spend money 
in a frozen account. McCullagh 
replied, If the account is frozen 
for legitimate reasons  no.
McCullagh was also asked if he
had ever purchased alcohol on 
his American Express Corporate 
Card. He replied that he had not. 
After some debate, Merle Atkin
son, Senate Funding and Recog
nition Chair, produced a receipt 
which showed that two beers had 
been billed to a check which Mc
Cullagh had signed and then paid 
for with his Corporate Card. Mc
Cullagh said he had no idea why 
those beers were charged to his 
check.
McCullaghs resignation pro
duced myriad responses from 
senators and students. Senate 
Chair Burt Holzman said he 
was expecting it. He also said, 
Personally, Im relieved its over.
I believe that anyone who 
can be proven guilty of fiscal 
mismanagement, financial mis
conduct and misrepresentation 
before Senate should not be 
the primary representative of 
the Carnegie Mellon student 
body, said Emma Gosden, 
Student Government Treasurer.
Ive known Declan since early 
September.... I think its frighten
ing, the questions comingfromthe 
Senators.... I definitely thinkthats 
something hard to get through, 
said Julie Crowell, Student 
Government Board President at 
the University of Pittsburgh.
Before announcing his resigna
tion, McCullaghs meeting took 
the form of an awards ceremony. 
I would like to thank the people 
with whom I have worked ... for 
their efforts as student leaders. 
Among the leaders were Mi
chael Breen, who headed the 
Scotland Yard Task Force, Martin 
Dixon of AB Tech, and Holzman. 
McCullagh then recognized other 
leaders. A number of other peo
ple have been excellent student
leaders in ... outstanding efforts 
at bringing the campus together. 
Tim Mallo, Kami White, Michael 
Loomis, Crowell, and a represen
tative from Duquesne each re
ceived an award.
McCullagh also highlighted his 
accompishments during his term 
as President. These included es
tablishing office hours with Rob
ert Mehrabian, President of the 
University, reopening Scotland 
Yard, and reorganizing the disci
plinary process.
McCullagh further defended 
his character by sharing letters he 
had received from other leaders. 
The first one, dated February 16, 
was from Christine DeVere, Stu
dent Body President at Chatham 
College. It is very encourag
ing to work with a student body 
president who has as much moti
vation and concern as Declan ... 
I strongly feel his leadership and 
character are beyond question.
The second letter was sent to 
Bill Elliott, VP for Enrollment, 
from the Office of the President 
of the United States. It thanked 
McCullagh for his work on the 
Democratic campaign and stated 
that [McCullagh] was direct and 
honest... [and] has integrity.
McCullaghs resignation is the 
final step in a series of events 
which has unfolded since Decem
ber.
McCullagh was convicted of 
harassment in a Pittsburgh court 
after being arrested on December 
5 on a domestic violence charge. 
Donna Riley, a graduate student 
in engineering and public policy, 
brought charges up against Mc
Cullagh after he allegedly pushed 
her down a flight of stairs. He was 
charged with simple assault and 
pled guilty to harassment.

and Marinelli to start a program 
devoted almost entirely to the no
tion of team-based learning.
Don and I came back and 
thought about it, and said, We 
could build a masters program 
specifically around the whole 
concept of learning to work in 
interdisciplinary teams. And we 
can give people something, here, 
better than they can get in the 
real world, said Pausch.
The brunt of the ETC curricu
lum is project-based. For example, 
the first semester is built around 
a grueling course called Build
ing Virtual Worlds. Here, teams 
must come up with an immersive, 
helmet-based virtual world ev
ery two weeks. The worlds them
selves range from the bizarre to 
the downright outstanding  a 
fact made all the more impres
sive by the fact that the class is 
taken during the first semester of 
enrollment.
Previous worlds have included 
white-water rafting, circus games, 
and Super Mario simulations, 
among other things. The project 
is impossible to complete alone, 
though; students must be able to 
delegate, compromise, and incor
porate one anothers skill sets to 
achieve the desired results.
The best projects are presented 
yearly to a packed house in McConomy Auditorium. We know that 
this is a very difficult program to 
get through psychologically and 
emotionally because you are re
ally forced to face your weak
nesses  theres nowhere to run 
and hide, said Pausch. That is 
one of the signature aspects of 
the program  and the students 
really appreciate it.
As do employers. Carnegie 
Mellons Entertainment Technol
ogy Center is one of the few pro
grams with formal agreements 
with companies who promise, in 
writing, to hire a certain percent
age of graduates each year.
Its the first time in my ca
reer that Ive ever seen companies 
forge written agreements sight 
unseen. And thats pretty remark
able, said Pausch.
Student projects aside, the En
tertainment Technology Center is
dedicated to developing a num
ber of interactive projects aimed 
at taking the multimedia plat
form to new and heretofore un
explored levels. After their first 
semester, students can choose 
to join one of these ongoing 
projects  or propose their own.
HazMat and PeaceMaker are 
two projects currently under developement at the ETC. HazMat is 
a multiplayer simulator that uses 
video game technology to train 
firemen, and other first respond
ers, in the event of chemical and 
hazardous material emergencies. 
Once a particular scenario is set, 
it is up to the player to respond to 
the ensuing situation - which can 
range from attending to civilians 
to evacuating subway cars.
PeaceMaker, another simula
tion, involves the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. Players must be pre
pared to handle diplomatic ne-' 
gotiations, suicide bombings and 
military blunders.
Video games like these are 
aimed to instruct through virtual 
simulations. But why use video 
games at all?
I find it fascinating that we 
have somehow, in this country, 
created an educational system 
where learning and having fun 
are considered to be two distinct 
activities, said Pausch. Why 
dont we think of learning as a 
recreational activity?
Interacting with the world is 
the way we learn about it. But if I
want to learn about peace in the 
Middle East, I cant really do it by 
picking up this chair and feeling 
it  which leads to the notion of 
simulation-based learning.
The next moment, a man wear
ing a full-blown bear costume 
walks by the door.
Just another day at the office, 
laughed Pausch.
Indeed. The Entertainment 
Technology Center, more than 
anything, is about being pas
sionate  and having fun. The 
schedule is rigorous, but students 
opt to hang around for so long 
that each floor is equipped with a 
kitchen. The students themselves 
describe their projects with a vim 
and vigor seldom seen in school 
environments. This passion is di
rectly reflected in the quality of 
the work.
The surface of the ETC has 
barely been scratched. The 2005 
semester projects include the Interbots Initiative group, designed 
to create animatronic charac
ters capable of interacting with 
humans and Qasi/a robot who 
is currently the mascot for the 
Worlds Fair for Kids.
Extensive information about 
the ETC can be found online at 
www.etc.cmu.edu. Readers are 
also encouraged to attend the 
Building Virtual Worlds show on 
December 7 in McConomy Audi
torium. But arrive earlyplaying 
in virtual worlds is fun. And the

Sitting on the bank of the 
Monongahela River, the fivestory gridiron structure housing 
Carnegie Mellons Entertainment 
Technology Center is hardly sug
gestive of entertainment  or 
technology. With its lattice beams 
and looming gray facade, the 
building seems every inch a hohum corporate headquarters.
Ride the elevator to the fifth 
floor, however, and something 
remarkable happens.
In stark contrast to the drab 
exterior, the walls inside are 
painted purple and yellow. Gumball machines, arcade games 
and lounge chairs dominate the 
lobby. Down the hall, Watto, the 
disgruntled junkyard proprietor 
from Star Wars Episode I, hangs 
suspended over the Terminator, 
Yoda, and life-sized cutouts of 
Gimli and Legolas. A purple wall 
displays a magnetic timeline de
tailing significant moments in 
entertainment history. Dotted 
among the factoids are posters 
of Frankenstein, Dracula, and Al
exander: The Man Who Knows 
Best. A Homer Simpson magnet 
reads Donuts: Is there nothing 
they cant do?
Welcome to the Entertainment 
Technology Center, home to the 
only masters program in enter
tainment technology in the coun
try. A joint effort by the Carnegie 
Mellon School of Computer Sci
ence and the School of Drama, 
the rigorous two-year program 
affords individual students the 
rare opportunity to combine their 
artistic and technical talents to
wards the pursuit of a common 
goal: entertainment.
The curriculum at the ETC is 
heavily project-based, and stu
dents spend much of their time 
working intensively in small 
groups. The groups, consisting 
of three or four students, usually 
include an artist, a programmer, 
and a project manager.
For Randy Pausch, a profes
sor of computer science, human-computer interaction, and 
design, and a co-director of the 
ETC, this emphasis on interdisci
plinary team-based learning was 
the driving motivation for the 
programs creation  and is the
primary reason for its phenom
enal success.
When Don Marinelli and 
I started this center, we went 
around and talked to a bunch, of 
companies, like Pixar and Indus
trial Light and Magic, and we said 
Why is it that you dont tend to 
hire 22-year-olds? Why is it that 
people working in computer-generated film, video games or places 
like Imagineering dont hire peo
ple straight out of school?
And we found that its not that 
their chops arent good enough, 
its not that they cant program or 
they cant draw, or whatever their 
talent is  its that they cant 
work in interdisciplinary teams. 
In fact, they havent learned how 
to work in teams at all, in those 
bachelor's programs  and they 
certainly havent learned to work 
with people that have different 
backgrounds than they do. And 
thats a pretty significant thing to 
not be able to do.
In fact, students entering the 
workplace with little or no teambased experience ended up hurt
ing their projects instead of help
ing them. This realization was 
significant enough to spur Pausch

Shabazz brings controversy to campus

tive Officer Bradford Yankiver, and the Pittsburgh In

ings of Shabazzs lecture, visit the website of Indyme

was cut short as the auditorium lights blacked out. 
Amidst cries of sabotage and blame, Shabazz com
posed himself and  lit by the projector  contin
ued his talk. Amidst the confusion, he likened the 
situation to that inside a slave ship as dozens of 
members of the audience tried to augment the light 
with their cellular phones.
Shabazzs lecture strayed at times to various 
issues, many of which contained anti-Jew or 
anti-Zionist messages. In one, he called the AntiDefamation League  an organization which aims 
to prevent Jewish and other cultural discrimination 
 an organization founded by gangsters.
Some of his statements expressed positive sen
timents, such as: Im striving for a righteous, 
clean, and productive society for my people. Many, 
though, were punctuated by divisive comments: 
Lets be honest: White folks are white folks! Can 
you tell the difference? Shabazz, however, denied 
allegations of racism, asking, How can I be a rac
ist? All we are is victims of racism.
Responding to calls that Shabazzs lecture strayed 
too far from its intended topic, Abigail Cyntje stated, 
The lecture that Attorney Shabazz presented did 
state that the role and responsibility of the black 
college student is to know the truth about your his
tory and ... to help advance your community.
Though Attorney Shabazz did touch on the topic 
at hand, there were segments of his lecture that re
sponded to the hostility towards him and the event. 
We did not expect the lecture to go off topic.
Guys like Shabazz prove that [diversity] is a big 
deal, said Suri, and thats why I think bringing him 
to campus was a good idea.... Now its out there.
jumping the queue.
I was in the first row and I was waiting for a long 
time, said Marina Meyster, a first-year student. At 
one point they wanted to let six people in, but [se
curity personnel] would just basically just pull out 
African-Americans out of the crowd.
The lecture hall was filled with students and 
members of the community, the majority of whom 
were African-American. Around the Porter 100 
dais, several NBPP members stood in uniform  at 
least one of whom was armed with a billy club, 
permitted on the spot by CMU Police.However, only 
audience members were checked for weaponry, 
according to campus police chief Creig Doyle; pre
senters and NBPP guards were not scanned.
Wright introduced Shabazz. This man is well 
versed in world issues, national, and local politics, 
she said. Hes so much more than the national 
chairman of the New Black Panther Party.
To this, Shabazz entered with a standing ova
tion. Shabazz started his presentation with his own 
smaller invocation and the first of many references 
to Farrakhan.
After listing his own achievements, such as hav
ing been voted Young Lawyer of the Year by the Na
tional Bar Association and winning court victories 
against anti-organizers, Shabazz himself eventually 
described his purpose in addressing the crowd: 
to speak about the roles and responsibilities of 
the black college student and white racism. After 
discussing the difficulty in coming after his funding 
was refused, Shabazz said of the University: This 
is supposed to be a place where diversity and ideas 
can be discussed, and Im disgusted.

Whats happened since 
Shabazz
by Justin Brown
Copy Staff
On Monday, October 17, sixteen people 
sat in a circle on the stage of McConomy 
Auditorium to discuss the future of Carnegie 
Mellon speakers rights.
This gathering discussed the current con
troversial speaker policy, and what changes, 
if any, were to be made. But these were not 
all elected officials or leaders of groups  in 
fact, the majority consisted of normal stu
dents with no credentials other than their 
own beliefs. This was one of many talks 
that a special commission, appointed in early 
September by President Cohon, will host in 
order to gauge public opinion.
The current controversial speaker policy 
has remained unchanged since the 1960s. It 
was last reviewed in 1997. Nicholas Scocozzo, 
the student body vice-president for finance 
and a member of the commission, said that 
CMU has many policies ... and we try to 
review them on a periodic basis. It was a good 
time to review this policy because it was put 
to the test this past spring [with speakers like 
Shabazz].
Clearly the events of last spring and data 
points over the last ten years prompted that 
it would be time to look at this policy again, 
said William Brown, professor of biology and 
the chair of the policy review commission.
However, he made clear that the review is 
not in reaction to those events in the past.
In conrast, others say last springs ros
ter of campus speakers, including Malik 
Zulu Shabazz, Ali Abunimah, and Norman 
Finkelstein, was among the reasons that the 
commission formed. However, Scocozzo said 
that some questioned whether the current 
speaker policy should be changed at all.
Scocozzo also said that a lot of the prob
lems last year were due to poor event plan
ning, and not the policy itself. Thus, the com
mission will also look into event guidelines.
The commissions job is to collect data on 
what the campus as a whole thinks about the 
speaker policy. It has set up several town 
hall-style meetings, and is also trying to meet 
with the more than 300 student groups on 
campus. We want to reach out to as much of 
the campus as possible to get their opinion, 
said Brown. We dont want to be weighted by 
any small group or individual.
The commission, appointed by Cohon, 
hopes to finish, its job by the end of the 
semester. Brown said that after gathering the 
information, the commission will report its 
findings and make a recommendation to the 
President. If any changes are proposed, they 
will have to go through the normal review 
process.
Some changes proposed at the recent town 
hall meeting included adding provisions for 
student safety to the policy, adding language 
about personal attacks and humiliation to 
the policy, and adding decision mechanisms 
to control whether a speaker is allowed to 
speak.
Some also said, however, that they wanted 
to leave the policy exactly as it is. Scocozzo 
described the two general sides he has seen: 
The latter, he said, is for free speech and aca
demic freedom, no questions asked.
There are ... those who feel there is a con
flict of community standards, Scocozzo said, 
some of whom think there should be guide
lines to avoid concepts like hate speech.
The committee encourages students to 
attend one of the upcoming town hall meetings. 
The next meeting is on Tuesday, November 1, 
at 5 pm, in the McKenna room; and the second 
is on Thursday, November 10.

Paralleling the format of last

the student body on making the 
donation possible.

foundation is headed by Gates 
father and commands an endow
ment of $27 billion, according 
to the foundations 2003 annual 
report. The foundation charges 
itself with supporting advances 
in global health and education.
Gates, who visited campus for 
a lecture last spring, has shown 
a great commitment to computer 
science education and research 
with the donation of buildings 
to major centers of CS research, 
in spite of having not finished
his degree program at Harvard. 
In his junior year in 1978, he 
dropped out to run his burgeon
ing Microsoft company, founded 
three years earlier with child
hood friend Paul Allen.
Gates expressed his own 
vision for the building, saying, 
Our goal is for this new build
ing to be a catalyst for computer 
science breakthroughs....[W]e 
hope the foundations gift will 
help the school continue to excel 
and push the envelope of human

according to a press release from

College of Fine Arts to celebrate its 100th anniversary
light their accomplishments over 
100 years of art. The exhibition 
will draw from many public and 
private collections to bring an 
enormous heritage together in 
one building.
The gallery will host the exhi
bition from January 20 through 
March 6. Sloss pointed out that 
the college will solicit works 
from alumni in all fields and has 
sent out a call for any additions 
alumni wish to make to this cel
ebration of CFAs legacy. Further, 
Sloss emphasized that the exhi
bition will represent all fields, 
and alumni who wish to submit 
photographs of scores, pictures of 
drama productions, digital videos 
of dances, or any other medium 
will find welcoming arms in the 
100% Centennial Exhibition.
Not to make the centennial 
seem to condense around two 
sole events, the CFA has put to
gether lectures, performances, 
and other venues that will make 
the year fit its role in the col
leges history. Gary Hume, Joseph 
Roach, and Tom Smart will pay 
visits to the CFA, and the differ
ent schools have lined up knock
out shows all year round. The 
School of Dramas productions 
promise superb stage work, and 
the School of Musics ensembles 
will present top-notch perfor
mances, to name just a few of the 
CFAs plans.
For Dean Robinson, this cen
tennial year of quality art affirms 
the CFAs place among the top 
arts schools in the nation. She 
said that, the work hard, play 
hard adage fits perfectly with 
this dedication to excellence in 
arts education and a grand Ball 
to celebrate it.
The centennial marks the end 
of 100 years that have formed 
an arts college at the top of 
its game, with potential that 
Robinson believes will help it 
grow dramatically. Her visits 
with alumni have allowed her 
to witness many misty-eyed 
looks upon past experiences 
in the college, but she stressed 
that nostalgia alone will not make 
a good arts program.
Being at the forefront doesnt 
necessarily mean being comfort

goals. We have to take risks to

Robinsons team to advance 
CFAs mission is the strongest 
that Ive ever come across, she 
said. Her confidence in her col
leagues shows that its future re

it all signals regrouping, and

Carnegie Mellon had one

this year.
In the last season of volleyballs

Carnegie Mellon team took an
other ECAC regional title  their 
third in a row  with a victory 
over Lebanon Valley College (Pa.).
The team co-hosted the UAAs 
round robin tournament in Octo
ber, which was a decided success 
for the team: CMU went unde
feated in the second half of the 
tournament. A fourth place finish 
in the UAA championship tourna
ment three weeks later earned 
them an ECAC bid.
The womens tennis team had 
a national champion in their run 
to the NCAA Division III top 25 
teams. Sophomore Amy Staioch 
won the Division III championship 
at the ITA Small College Champi
onships. A 6-4, 6-4 victory over 
top-seeded Jeannine Liang from 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps College
secured the Tartans top singles 
player a spot in the finals. Ris
ing early for an 8:30 am match, 
she met familiar rival Serena 
Burkhard of Emory University.
Burkhard appeared to have the 
upper hand as she took the first 
set 6-2, but Staloch would not roll 
over and give the match away. Be
hind strong serves and aggressive 
play at the net, Staloch battled 
back from the brink of defeat to 
force a third set with a 7-6 win 
after taking a 7-3 tiebreaker. The 
match came down to another tie
breaker in the last set, as Staloch

Sorority 
moves to 
frat quad
by Alexandra Kildruff
News Editor
Published April 11, 2005
Next year, sorority Kappa Al
pha Theta will trade its resi
dence on Margaret Morrison 
Street and become the first 
 sorority neighbors of Pi Kappa 
Alpha and Kappa Delta Rho on 
the fraternity quad. Kappa Al
pha Theta has accepted an offer 
from Housing Services to move 
into the residence vacated by 
Delta Tau Delta last semester, 
after DTDs Carnegie Mellon 
chapter was closed by orders 
from the national organization.
The decision to close the 
chapter comes after a semester 
punctuated by problems, includ
ing an incident in September 
in which a DTD member acci
dentally posted a party agenda 
to the University misc.market 
bulletin board. The agenda 
included member duties; one 
listed duty for brothers at the 
bar reminded them not [to] 
distribute ANY beer until they 
[Inter-fraternity Council repre
sentatives] leave. The bartend
ers were warned by members 
posted at the doors when IFC 
representatives were to arrive.
Thetas move is the most re
cent of several major changes 
to the fraternity quad, which 
include the creation of Forbes 
House in Kappa Sigmas former 
house, the vacation of DTD, and 
the recent announcement that 
Delta Upsilon will lose its house 
for one year starting this fall.
Neither the University nor 
the students want to see an 
empty house thats that large, 
and which is supportive to such 
a large chapter community, said 
Greek Council President Erin 
Weber, referring to DTDs former 
home, 1077 Morewood Avenue.
Weber, a senior BHA major 
with concentrations in design 
and psychology, added, It 
will be a nice transition for the 
Greek community to increase 
communication between the 
fraternities and the sororities.
According to Director of Stu
dent Life and Greek advisor Re
nee Camerlengo, Housing owns 
the residence and extended 
the offer to all of the sorori
ties on campus. The selection 
process, Camerlengo stressed, 
was completely random and 
involved Kappa Alpha Theta, 
Delta Gamma, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma, and Delta Delta Delta. 
Kappa Alpha Theta was, in Camerlengos words, picked out 
of a hat.
Nicole Saulnier, a senior in 
electrical and computer engi
neering and the president of 
Kappa Alpha Thetas CMU 
chapter, said We felt there was 
enough support from within 
our house [to accept the offer]. 
Kappa Alpha Theta currently 
has 64 active members; Saul
nier said the sorority plans on 
housing roughly 28 sisters.
Inter-fraternity Councils 
John Kubasiak remarked that 
There are opinions both ways, 
[and] once again its a mixed 
bag.
However, Kappa Delta Rho 
president Matthew Yeager 
didnt foresee any problems.
Were pretty indifferent 
about it, [but] whatever hap
pens, theyre going to be friend
lier than our last neighbors, 
he said. It will be a step in the 
right direction to helping the 
Greek community get back on 
its feet.
CMU wins $26.4 contract for unmanned military vehicle
by J.T. Trollman
Editor-in-Chief 
Published February 14, 2005
Carnegie Mellon University 
won out over Lockheed Martin 
this past week when researchers 
at CMUs Robotics Institute won a 
design and development contract 
from the U.S. government. CMU 
is now entering an age where 
investors are realizing that edu
cational institutions can innovate 
just as well as  or better than
 multinational corporations.
Last Monday, CMU represen
tatives were notified that they 
had won a $26.4 million gov
ernment contract to design and 
develop the Gladiator Tactical 
Unmanned Ground Vehicle, or
TUGV. Carnegie Mellon research
ers have been working on stages 
of the project since 2002.
Weighing one ton and resting 
on six wheels, the Gladiator is 
controlled remotely and can be 
outfitted with an array of sen
sor technology to detect possible 
hazards to soldiers. Although re
ports are vague as to what sen
sors might be used, the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette reports that they will 
be able to detect enemy posi
tions, barbed wire, mines, and 
even chemical, biological, or nu
clear threats.
Its not a coincidence that they 
[the Department of Defenses 
Joint Program Office for Robotic 
Systems] pick a university over 
a multi-billion-dollar business, 
says CMUs lead scientist on the
project, Dimitrius Apostolopoulos. What it means for CMU is 
the recognition, the motivation 
to push for greater and bigger 
things that will make the Univer
sity even more recognized.
The Gladiator is one result of 
[The Future Combat Initiative], 
said CMU and University of Pitts
burgh vice-president of economic 
development Don Smith, which 
seeks to increase the ratio of 
manned to unmanned vehicles to 
3:1 by 2015.
Although there have been stu
dent protests in the past at CMUs 
Software Institute regarding the 
Universitys ties to military re
search, the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technologys Student Pugwash president Chris Sequeira 
said that was not his primary
concern. Instead, he stressed that 
the Robotics Institute should be 
wary of contract stipulations and 
freedom of information regard
ing their research. Students and 
faculty must be allowed to decide 
for themselves if they really want 
to work for the military, he said.
The more important thing for 
Carnegie Mellon, said Smith, is 
were seeing robotics technology
 which was once seen as more 
of a fascination  start to have 
mainstream applications. Not 
just in the military, but also in 
entertainment technology and 
assisted living. [Now that] the 
commercial markets are start

with a conference record of 3-3-1. 
They earned a bye in the ECAC 
Southern region and used their 
position to become tournament 
champions. Two game-winning 
goals from junior Hallie Dumont 
pushed them to back-to-back 1-0 
victories over Penn State-Behrend 
and Johns Hopkins for the title. 
Senior keeper Megan Monroe be
came the Tartans career leader 
in shut-outs with 29 total after 
12 this year. Losing only Mon
roe as a starter places the team 
high in contention for 2005s 
UAA title.
The mens basketball team 
also completed one of its best 
seasons ever, competing in the 
postseason play for only the sec
ond time ever and the first in al
most 30 years. This run included 
their first-ever playoff victory, a 
come-from-behind win over Get
tysburg in the ECAC Southern 
tournament. The 19-7 record 
(10-4 UAA) represented the most 
wins ever by the team and its first 
winning conference record since 
it joined the UAA. Three players 
were named all-UAA: Junior NateSenior midfielder Sean Filipowitz steals the ball from two Brandeis players at Gesling Stadium.

Maurer and senior Michael Divens led the team all year and 
each scored their 1000th career 
point this season, while Clayton 
Barlow-Wilcox shone in the regu
lar season but especially in the 
playoffs.
In swimming, both teams 
ranked nationally this year. Senior 
Chris Pearson took first nation
ally in the 200 butterfly and 200 
freestyle to lead the CMU mens 
swimming team to a sixth-place 
finish in the NCAA. Pearsons 
third national championship in 
two years came as the swimming 
teams continued their national 
dominance, finishing eighth or 
better for the last five years.
Six other mens swimmers rep
resented the school at the NCAA 
Division III tournament with 
several other top-ten finishes. 
The teams, having taken several 
top finishes and school records 
at the conference championship 
a month earlier, particularly in 
womens relay events, earned 
two coaching staff awards and 
individual honors for Pearson. On 
the womens side of nationals, 
divers Julie Pavia and Mindy 
Finnegan pulled in a 25th-ranked 
finish for the womens diving 
program.
Carnegie Mellons strong 
showing in most of its athletics 
in 2004-2005 bodes well for 
next year. This exciting period 
in CMU athletic history comes 
also with the addition of a new 
athletic director and continued 
rise in profile within the Univer
sity Athletic Association and also 
nationally. Though its far from 
guaranteed what new players 
and coaches will bring next year, 
small turnover in some of the 
more dominant teams ensures 
that 2005-2006 will be a produc
tive and successful campaign.
