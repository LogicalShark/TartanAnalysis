New Dining 
Committee in 
testing phase
by Anne Jolis
Staffwriter
Neil Hunt has been unsatisfied with 
CMUs dining services since he was a 
freshman, and will now oversee a 
joint committee to try to address the 
problems he sees. Hunt, a junior eco
nomics major, will head the new 
Student Body Dining Comittee.
Hunt was the chairperson of the 
Student Dormitory Councils (SDCs) 
Food Committee but put in his resig
nation on Wednesday, February 19, 
when he decided to accept Student 
Body President Brian Nameys offer of 
chairing the new committee.
It was always the assumption that 
he would be the best person for the 
job. Hes been food chair for a year 
now, this is his second year, and he 
has a very good record for effective 
positive change in relation to dining in 
campus, said Namey, referring to 
changes like the Schatz All You Care 
to Eat Program and the increased 
availability of vegan and vegetarian 
options. The main difference between 
the old committee and the new one is 
that dining services will no longer be 
solely within the jurisdiction of the 
SDC, but will now comprise members 
of the Student Senate and the 
Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), as 
well as SDC. The new committees 
existence addresses the fact that not 
only campus-housing residents have a 
stake in campus dining, but com
muters and graduate students as well.
The representation [through SDC] 
really hasnt been broad enough, said 
Brian Namey, who has pushed for the 
new committee since early last semes
ter. Dan [Gilman, student body vice 
president] and I wanted to come up 
with a mechanism for gathering the 
most representative student feedback 
with regard to dining on campus, he 
said. According to Vito Fiore, Student 
Senate chair, the new committee will 
be tackling the same issues as the SDC 
food committee, such as the quality of 
food, the variety of options, the avail
ability, and the design of meal plans to 
better fit the economic and dietary 
needs of the students. Fiore is confi
dent that with hard work and tenacity 
the committee can be successful in 
offering broader representation for 
dining issues than the SDC commit
tee.
It will require pressure from the 
students and commitment from the 
administration, said Fiore. He said 
there has been some hesitation about 
the committees formation, however.
SDCs been in charge of dining for 
a while, and they really wanted to 
make sure that their authority would
nt be too greatly reduced. They didnt 
want to see it going to people who 
dont know what theyre doing, he 
said.
For this reason, the new committee 
will not be made official until the situ
ation has been thoroughly evaluated. 
Fiore said the new committee is cur
rently in a test phase, and will remain 
as such until at least Spring Break. 
Hunt said that because the logistics of 
getting a new committee invoked into 
the constitutions of each branch of 
student government take so long, the 
committee probably will not be a per
manent CMU fixture until next fall. 
Other possible setbacks for the com
mittee may arise from the fact that the 
administration and management of 
Dining Services are currently accus
tomed to dealing exclusively with the 
SDC food committee. According to 
Hunt, it may take a while for the new 
committee to establish a strong rela
tionship with Dining Services.
Essentially, students can expect to 
see little change in the way improve
ments are made to Dining Services. 
Hunt said that the new committees 
purpose is mainly to acknowledge 
that Dining Services affects all stu
dents, not just campus residents. The 
new committee will tackle the same 
issues as the SDC committee did, in 
the same manner. The meetings will 
have the same structure and schedule. 
The role of the new committee will 
not be different [from the old commit
tee] at all, said Hunt. Namey, howev
er, is glad to see that dining will final
ly have its own committee, and that 
all students will be represented.
If Senate and SDC are both work
ing to improve dining independently 
of one another, theres obviously 
some redundancy there, said Namey. 
Any branch of student government 
has a tendency to want to address 
issues of concern to any group of con
stituents on campus, but its my 
understanding that from here on out, 
in particular the SDC and the Senate 
will be working closely together to 
make sure that any redundancies are 
eliminated.
Interface conference cancelled
Committee chair says GSIA administration handled the situation badly
by Andrew Johnson
Editor-in-Chief
The annual Interface technology conference has been 
kyboshed for the second straight year. In a meeting 
Wednesday, GSIA administrators informed the MBA stu
dents planning the two-day conference, scheduled for 
March 18 and 19, that it had been cancelled. Interface 
chairperson Valerie Pajak, who was in charge of securing 
funding for the event, said that the conference had been 
cancelled prematurely in spite of a deal with administra
tors.
John Mather, director of the MBA program, said that 
the conference had been cancelled for lack of funding 
and a potential lack of interest in the event.
We had full support here for pulling the plug, said 
Mather, who said he made the decision to cancel the con
ference and that milestones had not been met in terms of 
funding.
Interface started four years ago as a conference featur
ing speakers and panel discussions on technology. In 
2001, Interface invited speakers in computing because 
the conference was dedicated to Herbert Simon, a Nobel 
Laureate from Carnegie Mellon who passed away 
February 9 of that year.
MBA students worked on the 2002 conference 
throughout last semester. This years conference was 
supposed to feature speakers in fields such as countert
errorism, new technology, and biotechnology. The group 
of roughly 15 to 20 students, according to Siqi Tan, who 
was the committee chair charged with finding biotech
nology speakers, met a few times each month to discuss 
progress.
He said Pajak reported having meetings with potential 
sponsors, but had never provided documentation of 
funding to the group.
Tan said that some of the chairs had more success than 
others finding speakers. Confirmed speakers included 
Don Grimm, a member of the Board of Visitors at the 
University of Pittsburgh; Carl Feldman, the 
Biotechnology Information Office executive director 
from Washington, D.C.; Sean McDonald CEO of 
Precision Therapeutics; and Russell Schwartz, Carnegie 
Mellon biology professor.
But it was a different speaker that Pajak said piqued 
the interest of the administration.
As soon as Dean Kamen confirmed, the [GSIA] 
administration wanted to get involved, said Pajak.
Kamen is the inventor of the Segway Human 
Transporter and the founder of DEKA Research. Pajak 
said she contacted Kamen in June 2002 and that he con
firmed in August.
On February 21, GSIA officials and committee mem
bers met to discuss issues with funding the conference. 
According to Tan and Pajak, the conference was to be 
scaled back to a one-day Kamen talk, eliminating the 
speakers that the committee chairs had secured, and the 
administration required that the group raise $10,000 by 
the following Friday, the minimum to pay for Kamens 
honorarium and travel expenses.
Last Tuesday, GSIA administrators cancelled the 
event.
Pajak said she had already met the $10,000 require
ment as of Tuesday when the conference was cancelled. 
She said she secured several sponsorships, and is irate 
with GSIA for not sticking to their side of the deal. Tan 
also said he was not sure why the conference was can
celled before the Friday deadline.
Mather declined to comment on his conversations 
with Pajak, but said that funding for a conference was 
money in a bank account or a letter of intent.

Club Laga 
raid leaves 
questions
by Jeannie Choi
Staffwriter
Authorities stopped the music at 
Club Laga on Saturday, February 22 
when over a hundred officers and 
city officials raided the club at 
around 1 am.
They interrupted both Hip Hop 
Night and Ceremony, a music event 
that features gothic and industrial 
music and takes place two floors 
beneath Hip Hop Night. Officials 
forced some people outside, where 
they were IDed and frisked for any 
weapons or drugs.
The raid came as a complete 
shock to club workers and people 
who attended the club events that 
evening.
There was the fire marshal, the 
health departments [sic], liquor 
control enforcement, the district 
attorney, and the assistant district 
attorney. They were all here, said 
Ron Levick, the owner of all three 
adjoining clubs, Club Laga, the 
Attic, and the Upstage.
This was much bigger than any 
raid before. It was a ton of people, 
said Levick. The authorities found 
no serious violations, and the club 
was open for a concert the next day, 
said Levick.
Bradford Yankiver/Photo Editor
Attendance was a bit thinner for Club Lagas hip hop night this week. About 200 
people showed up, as opposed to last weekends 600.
The raid is part of a series of 
inspections that the Pittsburgh 
Nuisance Bar Task Force has been 
conducting all around the city of 
Pittsburgh. The real cause for the 
inspections is still a mystery to 
Levick.
I think it was a waste of their time 
and the citys money. I dont under
stand what they were trying to do, 
said Levick.
Justin Gerle, a senior psychology 
major at CMU, works as a bouncer 
for Club Laga. He was present at the 
raid and cites the recent club acci
dents that occurred in Chicago and 
Rhode Island as possible reasons for 
the raids.
Im sure the police could use that 
as justification for the raid, not that 
weve ever had pyrotechnics at 
Laga, said Justin.
Since the raid on Saturday, how
ever, police have stated that these 
raids were planned before the other 
club accidents. The question of why 
these raids are happening now still 
remains unanswered, as the police 
were unavailable for comment.
Police have also not been in con
tact with Club Laga. Levick asked 
The Tartan to refer the authorities to 
him if The Tartan got in contact with 
police.
Charles Martin, another bouncer 
at Club Laga, believes that a fight 
that occurred in Laga on February 8 
could be a reason for this recent 
inquiry by the Pittsburgh Nuisance 
Bar Task Force.
The fight ended up going down 
to the Original Hot Dog Shop, and 
we ended up having to close early 
that night, said Martin.

Local Amnesty chapters host benefit 
for persecuted wife of Pitt researcher
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons branch of 
Amnesty International will join 
with the University of Pittsburghs 
chapter to champion a researcher 
at the University of Pittsburgh 
whose wife is a political prisoner in 
China because of religious beliefs 
the couple shares.
Cailu Xu and his wife practice 
Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline 
that involves meditation and exer
cise and centers around the three 
principles of truthfulness, compas
sion, and tolerance. The prayer 
and meditation exercises are 
banned in China, and the people 
who practice them are persecuted.
Xu, a researcher at the 
University of Pittsburgh, has not 
seen or spoken to his wife of 14 
years since she was placed in a 
female labor camp one and a half 
years ago.
In an effort to draw attention to 
his wifes case, Xu will speak at 
Carnegie Mellon on March 10 in 
McConomy Auditorium. The 
event, hosted by Amnesty 
International, will follow with a 
reception where students can 
speak personally with Xu and
write letters calling for Xiaomei 
Jias release. The letters will be 
sent to the Chinese embassy, U.S. 
Congressmen, and the labor camp 
itself.
Its an amazing opportunity to 
show we do have power as stu
dents at Carnegie Mellon and as 
citizens, and its an amazing 
opportunity to help someone who 
is in need, said Aseem Garg, a 
fifth-year senior double-majoring 
in Social & Decision Sciences and 
Computer Science, and a member 
of Amnesty International at 
Carnegie Mellon.
The communist Chinese govern
ment, said Xu, was afraid of the 
growing popularity of the practice. 
It is estimated that 70 to 100 mil
lion people practiced Falun Gong 
before the persecutions began. Xu 
said he and his wife recognized the 
beginnings of the persecution 
before President Jiang banned 
Falun Gong in 1999. Xu said that 
as early as 1996, government-controlled media began falsely label
ing criminals as Falun Gong practi
tioners and skewing reports. 
According to Emma Jin, a local 
practitioner who is assisting Xu in 
speaking out for his wife, this is the

Doctoral student diesy 
well-loved and talented
by Andrew Conklin
Assistant News Editor
Kanae Igarashi, a CMU doctoral 
student in Modern Languages, died 
Tuesday from an accidental fall that 
exacerbated her chronic health. She 
suffered from lupus, a disease that 
turns the bodys immune system 
against itself.
Igarashi, 37, was on the verge of 
earning her doctorate in Modern 
Languages.
Its so upsetting because she was 
so close to finishing her dissertation, 
said Richard Tucker, chair of the 
Modern Language department and 
Igarashis advisor.
Tucker said that Igarashi had com
pletely finished preparing for her oral 
dissertation defense that was sched
uled for March 10.
Igarashis doctoral thesis dealt with 
children learning Japanese as a sec
ond language.
She studied children at the Falk
School who were learning Japanese, 
said Kimmaree Murday, a fellow 
Modern Languages doctoral student 
and close friend of Igarashi.
She studied language play  she 
had recordings of the kids playing 
with the sounds and meanings of 
things with a language they were just 
learning, said Murday. Children do 
this when they first learn to speak, 
and they do this with a second lan
guage as well.
Dean Michael Murphy described 
Igarashi as an exceptionally talented 
scholar.
Kanae is such a wonderful 
teacher, said Etsuko Takahashi, a 
senior lecturer in Japanese, who 
Igarashi assisted in both Elementary 
and Intermediate Japanese. [She 
was] extremely skilled... She would 
emphasize socio-linguistic and cul
tural appropriateness as well as 
grammatical competence to maxi
mize students communication

Sharon sets hard 
rules for Palestine
JERUSALEM (AP)  Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon laid out tough 
terms for negotiating with the 
Palestinians on Friday as his new gov
ernment took office, putting him at 
odds with the United States over 
plans for peace in the Middle East.
Parliaments 66-48 vote of confi
dence in the coalition government 
the second to be led by Sharon 
came a day after President Bush 
ailed on Israel to work quickly 
toward creating a Palestinian state.
While the prime minister said his 
new team would work for peace in 
the Middle East, he said it would 
require a Cabinet vote before even 
considering a Palestinian state in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Palestinian officials said that 
Sharons stance left little hope for an 
end to 29 months of fighting that has 
' claimed nearly 3,000 lives. It is a 
government that is going to abandon 
peace, said Palestinian Cabinet 
Minister Saeb Erekat. Sharon has 
1 nothing to talk about.
In Washington, Bush said moves 
toward peace must include a halt in 
Israeli settlement building in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. But at 
least 14 of Sharons 24 ministers can 
be expected to oppose the idea of a 
Palestinian state in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, and at least two min
isters come from a party that actively 
champions the interests of settlers in 
the West Bank.
Bush also said a successful out
come of the Iraq crisis would mark 
-the beginning of a push toward solv
ing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
His main points were an end to vio
lence, a halt of settlement construc
tion and a viable Palestinian state.
Sharon and Bush agree that 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat must 
be sidelined and that Palestinian 
attacks must be halted. If Bushs postIraq foreign policy includes a concert
ed effort to push Israel and the 
Palestinians toward an agreement, 
Sharon will have difficulties pushing 
a Palestinian state of any kind 
through his new Cabinet.
Sharons opponents claim his 
acceptance of even a scaled-back 
Palestinian state under Israeli control 
is no more than lip service aimed at 
pleasing the United States, and that 
his heavily right-wing cabinet reflects 
his real views.
Israel is the party that is avoiding
and refusing the resumption of peace 
negotiations and insisting on achiev
ing its objectives by force, said 
Palestinian Labor Minister Ghassan 
Khatib.
The new coalitionbetween
Sharons Likud and a bloc of smaller 
partiescontrols 68 of the 120 seats 
in the parliament, a comfortable 
majority. Twenty ministers were 
sworn in early Friday after the vote of 
confidence and an eight-hour parlia
mentary debate. Three other minis
ters are to take office next week.
Likud, with 40 seats in the 120- 
member parliament, dominates the 
new Cabinet, taking 14 portfolios, 
including the most important: foreign 
affairs, defense, finance, and the pre
miership.
The Shinui Party, a centrist move
ment with a mostly domestic agenda, 
has 15 seats, making it the largest of 
Likuds three partners. It received five 
Cabinet positions. Shinuis leader, 
Yosef Lapid, does not reject creation 
of a Palestinian state, but like Sharon, 
rules out peace talks until violence is 
halted.
Thousands protest 
Iraqi war agenda
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP)  
Thousands of people marched in 
Bahrain, Egypt, and Yemen on Friday, 
burning U.S. flags and effigies of 
President Bush and demanding that 
the U.S. not invade Iraq.
Following Friday prayers, about 
5,000 Bahraini protesters marched 
nearly a mile from Manamas Ras 
Rumman mosque to UN offices in the 
capital, chanting Death to America, 
death to Israel.
Some demonstrators carried plac
ards accusing Washington of wanting 
to invade Iraq to seize its oil reserves 
and support Israel, while others 
urged Bahrains government to close 
the U.S. Navy base on this Persian 
Gulf island and expel the U.S. ambas
sador if the U.S. attacks Iraq.
Bush is the carbon copy of Hitler 
who is planning a genocide against 
the Iraqi people, activist Fadheela alMahroos said as other marchers 
burned U.S. and Israeli flags and car
ried a makeshift coffin with Bush 
scrawled on one end.
Bahrain is home to the U.S. 5th 
Fleet and hosts more than 4,000 
American military personnel. The 
government has long rejected public 
calls for.the U.S. military to leave.
In Egypt, some 3,000 people gath
ered outside downtown Cairos AlAzhar mosque to protest American 
war plans in Iraq.

Minors consume a 
fifth of US alcohol
CHICAGO (AP)  Underage 
drinkers account for nearly 20 per
cent of the alcohol consumed in the 
United States each year, a study says.
Attempting to correct botched sta
tistics they released a year ago, 
researchers from Columbia 
Universitys National Center on 
Addiction and Substance Abuse ana
lyzed three sets of data from 1999 
and said underage drinking amount
ed to 19.7 percent of alcohol con
sumed that year, or $22.5 billion;
The previous estimate  now dis
credited  was 25 percent.
Excessive drinking by adults  
consumption of more than two drinks 
daily  amounted to 30.4 percent, or 
$34.4 billion, the researchers said. 
Their definition of excessive drinking 
is anything exceeding government 
guidelines for moderate drinking.
These analyses show that it is not 
in the alcohol industrys financial 
interest to voluntarily enact strategies 
to reduce underage or adult excessive 
drinking, the researchers said.
The Columbia center is an advoca
cy group led by Joseph Califano Jr., a 
former U.S. secretary of health, edu
cation, and welfare who has been an 
outspoken critic of alcohol marketers.
The group issued a report last year 
saying that young people ages 12 
through 20 consume 25 percent of 
the nations alcohol, a figure based on 
the 1998 National Household Survey 
of Drug Abuse. Critics questioned the 
statistics, and Califanos group 
acknowledged that it had failed to 
adjust its figures to reflect teens per
centage of the nations population.
The new analysis appears in 
Wednesdays Journal of the American 
Medical Association.
It included data from the 1999 ver
sion of the household survey, which 
involved more than 50,000 people 
aged 12 or older questioned at home.
It also included data from two sur
veys of youngsters 12 or older who 
were questioned at school.
Representatives of the alcohol 
industry called the ne.w study as 
faulty as the old one, and questioned 
the researchers definition of exces
sive adult drinking.
Homeland Security 
Department begins
WASHINGTON (AP)  President 
Bush promised a united defense of 
our homeland Friday in marking the 
launch of the department created to 
answer the danger of terrorism.
The Homeland Security 
Department combines the forces of 
22 agencies and 170,000 workers 
who patrol Americas borders, secure 
computer networks, check for conta
mination of crops, and otherwise 
help guard against terrorism. 
Saturday is its first full day of work.
Every member of this new depart
ment accepts an essential mission  
to prevent another terrorist attack, 
Bush told Cabinet members and fed
eral workers involved in homeland 
defense. Yours is a vital and impor
tant step in reorganizing the govern
ment to meet the threats of a new era 
as we continue to work to secure this 
country.
On Saturday, the agencies and 
workers officially fold into the new 
department, the largest government 
reorganization since the Department 
of Defense was created in 1947.
Tom Ridge, Bushs 15th Cabinet 
secretary, leads the agency.
Some Democrats, including the 
partys presidential candidates, have 
complained that the Bush administra
tion hasnt devoted enough money 
and resources to the job.
In response, Bush said much has 
been done already.
While there is no guarantee of pre
venting an attack, the president said, 
Were determined to do everything 
in our power to defeat this enemy and 
defend our people while upholding 
the Constitution.

Cornell sends out 
false acceptances
ITHACA, NY (AP)  Cornell 
University mistakenly sent out an email message welcoming hundreds 
of students it had previously reject
ed.
The mistake happened 
Wednesday when a clerical staff 
member miscoded a message meant 
only for students who had applied 
early and been accepted.
As a result of the error, the email 
was sent to i,700 students, includ
ing nearly 550 high school seniors 
that the Ivy League school in upstate 
Ithaca had rejected in December.
Greetings from Cornell, your 
future alma mater! the message 
said. Congratulations on your 
acceptance into the class of 2007!
The mistake was discovered when 
someone noticed that too many 
messages had been sent. The univer
sity then emailed a follow-up mes
sage, explaining what had hap
pened.
I was in shock, Angela GriffinJones, dean of undergraduate 
admissions, told The New York 
Times. Im still in shock.
While university admissions 
offices sometimes make mistakes, 
college admissions officials said the 
scope of Cornells error was unusu
al.
It is safe to say that every admis
sions office has had some experi
ence where some kid has gotten the 
wrong letter, Joyce E. Smith, execu

Penn faculty lead 
way to new NYC
PHILADELPHIA (U-WIRE)  
Years from now, when the worlds 
tallest building stands on the World 
Trade Center site, onlookers will 
have University of Pennsylvania fac
ulty to thank.
Penn architects Daniel Libeskind 
and Gary Hack were announced as 
the winners of the international 
competition for the new design of 
the World Trade Center in New York 
City.
Hack is the dean of Penns 
Graduate School of Fine Arts and 
chairman of the Philadelphia City 
Planning Commission. Libeskind is 
the principal architect of Studio 
Daniel Libeskind and a Paul 
Philippe Cret Professor of 
Architecture for Penn.
These are the best in the world, 
and everyone is excited about this 
proposal, Regional Plan 
Association President Robert Yaro 
said.
The idea of the project  which. 
Libeskind named the Memory 
Foundations project  was the 
brainchild of Libeskind, Hack, 
Libeskinds architecture group in 
Berlin, and a landscape architect 
from Harvard University.
The plan was preferred above all 
others because it was considered 
visionary, according to Yaro, cre
ating a powerful and moving set
ting for a permanent memorial 
while still being something that 
could successfully be built and 
made to work.
And Hack said this historic, 
grand-scale project is just the sort 
of endeavor for which Penns archi
tecture school strives.
The school has a commitment 
to being engaged in [the] most 
important issue of the day, and this 
is the most important issue at the 
moment, Hack said.
The project concentrates on this 
new symbolic space in Lower 
Manhattan, added Yaro, who is 
also a Penn-affiliated expert in city 
planning. It intends to represent 
both the citys mourning for the 
victims and its rebirth.
Spread across the 16 acres of 
Ground Zero, the project arranges 
the buildings so that on September 
11 of each year, a ray of sunlight 
will strike the site from 8:46 am, 
when the first plane hit, to 10:28 
am, when the second tower fell.
Im not sure who came up with 
[the idea].... The way it works on a 
team is that ideas come out of dia

create an area like Stonehenge,

Our idea is that our building

The plan also includes the

ing 1,776 feet with the Gardens of

The winning project was one of

Televisions Mr. 
Rogers dies at 74
PITTSBURGH (AP)  Fred 
Rogers, who gently invited mil
lions of children to be his neighbor 
as host of the public television 
show Mister Rogers Neighbor
hood for more than 30 years, died 
of cancer early Thursday. He was 
74.
Rogers died at his Pittsburgh 
home, said family spokesman 
David Newell, who played Mr. 
McFeely on the show. Newell said 
Rogers had been diagnosed with 
stomach cancer sometime after the 
holidays.
From 1968 to 2000, Rogers, an 
ordained Presbyterian minister, 
produced the show at Pittsburgh 
public television station WQED. 
The final new episode, which was 
taped in December 2000, aired in 
August 2001, though PBS affiliates 
continued to air back episodes.
Rogers composed his own songs 
for the show and began each 
episode in a set made to look like a 
comfortable living room, singing, 
Its a beautiful day in the neigh
borhood, as he donned sneakers 
and a zip-up cardigan.
His message remained a simple 
one throughout the years, telling 
his viewers to love themselves and 
others. On each show, he would 
take his audience on a magical 
trolley ride into the Neighborhood 
of Make-Believe, where his puppet 
creations would interact with each 
other and adults.
Rogers did much of the puppet 
work and voices himself.
Local schools get 
Medicaid money
PITTSBURGH (AP)  In a dis
trict where computers, t-shirts, 
and a school-sponsored bowling 
trip wouldnt fit in the budget, 
Pittsburgh middle school principal 
Debra Rucki says her students now 
have an unusual benefactor: 
Medicaid.
Its like a blessing, Rucki said.
Medicaid, a health care program 
for the poor, pays schools for the 
time employees spend doing 
administrative activities, such as 
helping students determine eligi
bility, enrolling them in programs, 
and monitoring their progress. 
Each state determines how the 
money can be spent, but it is gen
erally used to supplement existing 
school programs.
In late 2001, the Pittsburgh pub
lic school system launched an ini
tiative to instruct teachers and 
staff how to apply for reimburse
ment from Medicaid.
Since then, the districts annual 
Medicaid reimbursement has sky
rocketed, rising from $220,000 in 
2001 to $2.6 million in 2002.
At a time when public coffers are 
low, the reimbursement opportu
nity is attracting districts across 
the nation. Philadelphia expects to 
get $2.5 million this year; Chicago, 
which has been seeking reim
bursement for nearly a decade, 
received about $16 million last 
year.

polluted water from the bowels of 
Parys Mountain near Amlwch-onAnglesey will begin later in March. 
An estimated 50,000 cubic meters of 
acidic water is trapped underground, 
and there have been concerns about 
the huge environmental implications 
and the serious flooding risk if the 
concrete dam, which holds back the 
water, suddenly gives way.
fife A research project launched

Islands, and Iceland. It might lead to 
important opportunities for 
Scotlands burgeoning native timber 
industry.

Bats invade GA 
high school play
KINGSLAND, GA (AP)  An 
invasion by hundreds of bats has 
postponed the Camden County 
High School production of The 
Pirates of Penzance until next 
month.
The bats were discovered earlier 
this week in the auditorium at the
southeast Georgia school near the 
Florida border.
It felt sort of like a movie, said 
Dean Slusser, the schools fine arts 
director who first discovered the 
bats.
I would guess at least a couple 
dozen were active in the hallway. 
We just propped the doors and let 
them fly [out].
But hundreds of bats found the 
ceiling rafters to their liking and 
decided to stay.
With some help from the U.S.

were only two to four left by 
Friday, said Dr. Will Hardin, the

$400.
Marijuana Possession, 2/27/03, 
12:02 am  A night security guard 
observed first-year MCS student 
Michael Lee smoking what appeared 
to be marijuana outside the entrance 
doors to the UC. When approached, 
Lee ducked behind a pillar and 
dropped a roach clip and a small 
roach of marijuana. He then entered 
the UC and began to run towards the 
Wiegand Gym. All on-duty night per
sonnel responded to the scene.
A police officer encountered Lee 
near Gesling Stadium and repeatedly 
demanded that he stop. Lee ignored 
the demands and began to sprint 
towards Doherty Apartments. Once 
he arrived at Dohertys upper lot, he 
crouched behind a five-foot pile of 
snow. When the officer ordered Lee 
to leave his hiding place and remove 
his hands from his pockets, he walked 
hurriedly towards the officer without 
revealing his hands.
When he had almost reached the 
officer, the officer engaged Lee and 
they both fell to the ground. Lee 
resisted arrest, but the responding 
officers were eventually able to hand
cuff him. He was then transported to 
CMUs police station, where he was 
informed of his Miranda rights.
Lee admitted to his use of marijua
na, and justified his actions by 
explaining that he had freaked out, 
and that the marijuana made him 
paranoid. He was issued citations for 
disorderly conduct.

CMU does little to 
prepare for attack
On February 12, FBI Director 
Robert Mueller told the Senate Select 
Intelligence Committee that 
American colleges and universities 
are at risk for terrorist attacks and 
that they would be easy soft targets. 
Last week, the nations terrorist 
threat level raised from yellow, an 
elevated risk of terrorist attack, to 
orange, meaning a high risk for ter
rorist attack.
As a result, many universities in the 
country, including Columbia, 
Harvard, Georgetown, Princeton, and 
the University of Pennsylvania, sent 
emails to staff and students reassur
ing them that precautions were being 
taken for their safety. Students at 
CMU did not receive any such email.
While many parts of both the pub
lic and private sector took special pre
cautions last week as a result of the 
alert, no such action was taken here, 
according to CMU Police Chief Creig 
Doyle, Madelyn Miller of the 
Department of Environmental Health 
and Safety, and Ray Demichei, an 
EMS officer for the City of Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Mellon did, however, 
convene information sessions on 
campus to inform students and staff 
about the emergency response plan 
and update them as to whats going 
on, according to Madelyn Miller.
Aside from offering courses or 
answering questions, that was the 
only difference in alert levels, said 
Miller.
Miller said a meeting between 
University officials and the City of 
Pittsburghs emergency management 
services officer occurred last week. 
According to Miller, the officer was 
confident that CMU was adequately 
prepared.
They really relied on us making 
contact with them, said Miller. We 
are integrated into their incident 
command system, she said.
As of Thursday, February 27, the 
nations threat level was lowered 
back down to a level yellow elevat
ed risk of terrorist attack alert.

Humanities track 
mixes disciplines
A new first-year program for next 
semester is part of an effort to 
increase the visibility of the humani
ties at Carnegie Mellon, said John 
Lehoczky, the dean of H&SS. The 
Humanities Scholars Program will 
offer twenty students the opportunity 
to take team-taught courses struc
tured around interdisciplinary curriculae and to work closely with faculty 
on humanities research.
Scholars will take four courses in 
their first two years, spend a semester 
doing independent research, and 
complete a research colloquium in 
their fourth year. The courses will be 
taught by instructors from different 
humanities disciplines.
Its a chance for faculty from dif
ferent disciplines to collaborate and a 
way for students to see how different 
disciplines approach a topic, said 
Michael West, the director of the pro
gram and a principal lecturer in the 
department of modern languages. 
West will be teaching the course, 
Revolts and Revolutions in France 
from 1789 to 1968, with Katherine 
Lynch, a professor of history.
According to West, the small class 
sizes and one-on-one involvement 
with faculty will contribute to the 
academic rigor of the program.
Well be looking for students who 
-have an interest in more than one 
area of humanities, said West.
According to Lehoczky, the pro
gram aims to attract outstanding 
humanities students who otherwise 
would not consider Carnegie Mellon 
as a possible college choice.
 We hope that it will serve the 
interests of all students at Carnegie 
Mellon by making humanities study 
integral to the Universitys intellectu
al profile and education, he said.
The twenty students are encour
aged to live together in Morewood 
Gardens, to help build relationships.
Debate explores 
Iraqi war issues
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
Moderation was not the key at a 
University of Pittsburgh-sponsored 
debate on the issues concerning 
Iraq.
The panel discussion Tuesday 
night, What Should the States Do 
About Iraq Now?, invoked passion 
in all the participants.
The debate, sponsored by the 
University Honors College, included 
panelists Bay Buchanan, president 
of the American Cause and former 
treasurer of the United States; 
Robert Hazo, Pitt professor and 
chair of the Middle East Policy 
Association; Jack Kelly, national 
security writer for the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette; and Cyril Wecht, 
Allegheny County coroner. It was 
moderated by Donald Goldstein, of 
Pitts Graduate School of Public and 
International Affairs.
Hazo opened th debate saying 
that he usually has the position of 
moderator when he attends such 
discussions.
But now I dont have to be mod
erate, Hazo said.
Both he and the other panelists 
took this statement to heart, sparing 
no one and making statements 
attacking President George W. 
Bush, various European countries 
and their leaders, and entire regions 
of the world.
Hazo spoke as a man ashamed of 
his country and his countrys presi
dent.
People wonder what the presi
dent is thinking. Why do you 
assume hes thinking? Hazo asked. 
He is expending millions of dollars 
to commit the equivalent of geopo
litical suicide.
But Hazos argument focused on 
more than the monetary costs of a 
war with Iraq.
Our government does not seem 
to understand that this will seem to 
be an attack on Islam, Hazo said. 
Most people will not see us as great 
liberators.
Jack Kelly spoke confidently of 
the United States ability to avert 
military catastrophe on the battle
field.
Smallpox and anthrax we are 
vaccinated against. Chemical 
agents? We are protected against 
those too, Kelly said.
Pitts Sigma Chi 
charter suspended
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
University of Pittsburghs largest fra
ternity will not be here next year  at 
least not officially.
As punishment for a charge of insti
tutional vandalism, Sigma Chi will 
not be officially recognized by the 
University next year while the frater
nity serves a one-year suspension.
Sigma Chi risk management chair 
and Student Government Board 
member Pat Creighton said that the 
suspension is the result of an incident 
in late January. According to 
Creighton, several brothers were run
ning around outside the house after 
coming back from a party. Pitt police 
officers arrived on the scene to find 
one of the houses rooms in disarray.
A couple of brothers got a little out 
of hand, Creighton said, adding that 
all involved were being brought up on 
charges for individual punishment 
internally.
Creighton said the original punish
ment had been more severe, but that 
an appeal to Vice Provost for 
Undergraduate Studies and Dean of 
Students Jack Daniel resulted in a 
reduced suspension and permission 
to stay in the on-campus housing next 
year.
We were wrong; were not deny
ing the fact that we were wrong. 
Creighton said, but added, I think 
the crime didnt fit the punishment.
He said that several other fraterni
ties have been cited for institutional 
vandalism in the past and theyre 
still here.
There are fraternities that have 
done things a lot worse than us, he 
said.
Creighton pointed to the newly 
released Greek life report, which sug
gests that on-campus fraternities 
have graduate assistants, and said 
that if Sigma Chi had a graduate 
assistant in the house, the incident 
might not have occurred.
Maybe if we had something of that 
nature in our house, this never would 
have happened, Creighton said, 
adding that, with the loss of former 
greek adviser Sharon Malazich and 
former Director of Student Activities 
Joe Cavalla, Student Life is moving 
in a new direction with regard to 
Greek life.
They basically cut two steps out of 
the whole process, he said.
Director of Student Life Birney 
Harrigan said that the matter was 
confidential and that she could not 
comment on it.

THE TARTAN  MARCH 3, 2003
Amnesty hosts benefit for 
Chinese graduate student
AMNESTY, from page A1
reason so many Chinese people 
perceive the practice as wickedly 
cultish and politically deviant.
Many people continued to prac
tice, despite the ban and increasing 
harassment. Some began to disap
pear; they were released from their 
jobs, monitored by police, and their 
homes were ransacked. Jin said 
people continued to practice 
because their feelings toward Falun 
Gong are so strong.
Some of them were saved by 
this practice, she said. We think 
this is the most important thing in 
our life.
Xus ordeal began in January 
2001, when he came home to find 
his phone line had been cut and his 
fuse box was gone. Since the ban, 
Jia had been arrested on three sep
arate occasions, once for admitting 
she was a practitioner and twice for 
doing Falun Gong exercises. She 
was released from her job in August 
2001.
On November 5, 2001, she was 
detained in Beijing for a final time 
while passing out fliers condemn
ing the persecutions. This time she 
was not allowed to go home, and 
was instead sent to a female labor 
camp.
Xu received a notice of his wifes 
imprisonment with no scheduled 
date of release..
Xu said the only information he 
receives comes from occasional 
calls from his sister-in-law, who is 
allowed to visit Jia. He also gets 
information from the stories of sur
vivors.
There are many Falun Gong 
practitioners there, about a thou
sand, said Xu. Many of them are 
released after a period of 1 to 2 
years, and theyve reported being 
tortured.
According to the Falun Dafa 
Information Center, an internation
al organization aimed at ending the 
persecution, survivors reported 
being tortured by electric batons, 
beaten repeatedly, and force-fed. 
Force feedings, Jin said, are com
mon procedures that are meant to 
torture, not save lives.
If a practitioner goes on a hunger 
strike and refuses to eat, untrained 
guards force plastic tubes through 
their mouth or nose to their stom
ach, feeding them with highly con
centrated salt water that may be 
mixed with dangerous drugs.
Sometimes they miss, puncturing a 
lung, and sometimes the prisoner 
dies from the procedure.
The deaths of 578 practitioners 
by police torture haVe been con
firmed; however, the Falun Dafa 
Information Center reports that the 
number is probably twice as large.
580 people have been con
firmed dead, said Jin, translating 
for Xu. [Xu] doesnt want his wife 
to be one of them, and he doesnt 
know. Thats the worst part.
Xu has heard that Jia is allowed 
only 2 or 3 hours of sleep a night 
after hours of hard physical labor. 
According to Jin, sleep-deprivation 
facilitates a form of brainwashing 
the Chinese government calls a re
education process.
When people cannot think 
clearly they force them to read and 
watch propaganda films, Jin said. 
Their courage and their spirit are 
broken.
The re-education process. 
defames Falun Gong through pro
paganda in an attempt to force 
practitioners to renounce the prac
tice, sometimes publicly, said Jin. 
The Chinese media use interviews 
with practitioners to further 
defame the practice.
In China, people dont have the 
opportunity to see the other side. 
Thats why brainwashing works, 
said Jin. In the U.S., imagine if all 
TV stations, newspapers, and radio 
stations are telling you one thing. 
Its hard to get the right informa
tion.
Xu said he believes outside 
efforts will help free his wife. U.S. 
legislators are currently urging the 
release of American citizen Charles 
Li, a Falun Gong practitioner who 
was arrested upon his arrival in 
China on January 22. In July 2002, 
the House of Representatives 
passed resolution 188 by a vote of 
420-0 condemning the persecution 
of Falun Gong in China.
Xu hopes that letters written on 
his wifes behalf will raise even 
more international awareness and 
pressure President Jiang to stop the 
persecutions.
He misses his wife and his 14- 
year old son who lives in China 
with an aunt.
He and his wife and his son had 
a very happy family and he hopes it 
can resume here, she said. They 
may have many difficulties, but the 
most important thing is to have 
family together here.

Senate ignoresanti-war motion, waits for poll
by Anne Jolis
Staffwriter
Last Thursday, Daniel Papasian heated up 
Student Senate by re-introducing a controversial 
anti-war resolution.
The resolution was conceived by the Progressive 
Student Alliance (PSA), of which Papasian, a firstyear CIT student, is a member, and decries the war 
in Iraq on behalf of all CMU students. If passed by 
Senate, it would be sent to a number of politicians 
and administrators, including President George 
Bush, Governor Ed Rendell, and Pennsylvanias 
representatives in Congress.
Papasian had brought forth the resolution a week 
earlier at the February 20 meeting. This resulted in 
an intense discussion among the Senators, but 
when two Senators left while the meeting was 
being relocated to another room because their 
allotted time to be using the meeting room had run 
out, a quorum was no longer present. Of 34 
Senators elected for this term, 18, or one more than 
half, must be present to hold a vote.
The Senators discussed the resolution again on 
Thursday, February 27, but after the discussion 
Papasian decided to withdraw the motion.
1 withdrew the motion because I still feel that, 
the CMU undergraduate student body would sup
port an anti-war resolution, but I think they would 
be very discouraged to see one being defeated by 
the Senate, said Papasian.
However, many Senators spoke up at Thursdays 
meeting in strong disagreement with Papasian, say
ing the resolution does not accurately reflect the 
majority of students opinions, and would not be 
supported by the student body.
Jason Gu, a sophomore materials engineering 
student, said he had received several emails from 
constituents asking him not to vote for the resolu
tion.
I dont think this represents even a majority of 
the campus. I think we should shoot the resolution 
down right now, said Gu.
Senators also expressed concern that Papasian 
and other supporters of the resolution had not 
taken the time to thoroughly poll and gauge stu
dents opinions, and asserted that until this had 
been done, Senate shouldnt act on behalf of 
Carnegie Mellons undergraduates.
We have to poll the entire student body, said 
Randy Sinott, a first-year IT and ECE student.
Papasian said that whether or not the majority of 
the student body supported the resolution was not 
the only issue.
Ive received a lot of email, too. Some are for the 
resolution, some against it. Its not just a statistical 
issue. We are charged not just with carrying out 
what the student body would prefer, but also with 
what is in their best interest, he said.
Some student body executives said there could 
be backlash from the resolution.
This will affect all of us. All the jobs, business, 
and money that this University gets from the 
Department of Defense  there could be a lot of 
backlash, and all for a piece of paper. Its not worth 
it, said Andrew Dubois, student body vice presi
dent of finance.

derailed and destroyed by CMUs student govern
ment, said Brian Namey, student body president.
At the next Student Senate meeting on 
Thursday, March 13, Papasian and Michael 
Moiseyev, also a Senator, will present a new ver
sion of the resolution, which will state the same 
views as the old one but will officially be a new res
olution and a motion.
Moiseyev, a senior math major, and Papasian 
are prepared for the resolution to be rejected at 
the next meeting but said their main goal is to have 
a discussion on what is the best way to compile 
students opinions.
Moiseyev said he is working on a way to estab
lish communication with students more expedi
ently, and he is confident that he will be able to 
have every single undergraduates opinion on 
whether or not the resolution should or should not 
be passed.
I dont think the resolution needs to be passed 
quickly, said Moiseyev. We have the time to dis
cuss the issue and make the most informed deci
sion.
He and Papasian predict that the motion will be 
tabled at the next meeting, depending on how dis
cussions go, and will be voted on once the student 
bodys opinion has been established.
Though Moiseyev and Papasian see no rush, 
other Senators would like to see the issue resolved 
as soon as possible.
I think its going to cause more heavy debate, 
and I will object if it goes on for another meeting, 
said Stephanie Hepner, a Senator and senior mod
ern languages and history major. This issue is a 
total waste of Senates time.
Hepner says that she has emailed 118 people on 
the issue asking for feedback, has received many 
responses, and would like to receive more still. But 
according to her, the consensus seems to be that 
the student body does not want the resolution 
passed on their behalf.
Most of the feedback Ive gotten is against the 
resolution. My constituents feel that this is beyond 
Senates duties, she said.

George Soros decries foreign policy 
and the U.S.s role in nuclear conflict
by Andrew Conklin
Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon continued the University Lecture 
Series program Thursday when McConomy Auditorium 
hosted George Soros.
Soros, 72, founded and presides over Soros Fund 
Management LLC, a highly successful investment firm. 
Forbes Magazine lists Soros as the thirty-seventh richest 
man in the world, with a net worth around seven billion 
dollars.
Soros, who currently chairs the Open Society 
Institute, spoke to the University community about the 
problems of globalization.
The main source of poverty and misery in the world 
today is bad government, yet it is difficult to meddle in 
the affairs of other countries because of sovereignty, 
said Soros.
He described sovereignty, or national independence, 
as an anachronistic process.
A world order based on the sovereignty of states cant 
take care of our common interests, said Soros.
The U.S. cannot create a global society on its own; no 
single country can act as a policeman or a benefactor of 
the entire world. Equally, it cannot be done without the 
participation of the U.S. This means that the U.S. must 
engage in international corporations; it must be willing 
to abide by the rules that it seeks to impose on others, 
and it must accept its share of costs. Thats not the direc
tion in which the Bush administration is leading us, said 
Soros.
For the rest of his speech, Soros explained the short
comings that he believes hinder the current administra
tion.
The Bush administration ... seeks to advance the role 
of the U.S. as a world superpower. This is a theory in 
which America leads, and the rest of world follows, said 
Soros.
This imperial vision is more inappropriate and unat
tainable than the vision of a global society; it is also more 
unappealing, and contradicts the values that the U.S. has 
historically assumed, he said.
Soros took issue with President Bushs foreign policy 
in South Korea, Russia, China, and the entire European 
continent, painting a picture of America as a fearful 
giant throwing its weight around, the classic definition 
of a bully.
Attendees had varied reactions to Soross words.
I think Mr. Soros made some very brave statements 
about the political situation, said Eugene Toh, a fresh
man ECE major from Singapore. Sometimes [we] see 
Mr. Bush trying to play world policeman, and some of his 
actions are not totally justifiable or agreeable to the rest 
of the world.
Others present were not as receptive to Soross ideas.
[Soros] is a very nice rich man who has done a lot of 
good in the world, but he should stick to finance instead 
of politics, said Walt Popovski, a Whitehall resident who 
attended the talk.

INTERFACE, from page A1
Gus Glyptis, a Flex-Time MBA stu
dent who is dating Pajak, said Pajak 
asked him to help get funding for 
the conference in the last two 
months.
Glyptis attended the meeting last 
Wednesday when the committee 
was informed of the cancellation of 
the conference.
I personally think they shouldnt 
have cancelled the conference, said 
Glyptis.
He said, however, that at this 
point he was more concerned with 
the lack of communication and the 
role of the GSIA administration in 
canceling what was supposed to be 
a student-run event than the out
come.
There are a lot of disgruntled 
students at GSIA right now, he 
said.
Tan said that he was not sure why
GSIA chose to stop the talk, but that 
he was suspicious that Pajaks fund
ing was in place and that Pajak had 
been able to garner large donations 
with such good timing near the end. 
He also said that normally in plan
ning an event that requires lots of 
sponsorship, in this case about 
$20,000, one secures money in a 
regular fashion as planning pro
ceeds.
While he did not know why GSIA 
reneged on the deal they gave 
Friday, Tan was concerned as of 
Wednesday that the cancellations 
would reflect badly on the school 
and students, and wanted to go 
ahead with cancellations in a timely 
fashion.
According to emails forwarded to 
The Tartan by Pajak, she had likely 
secured at least $3,000 for the 
Interface Conference, though it is 
unclear from the emails if she had 
raised $10,000.
Largest raid 
ever at Laga 
yields arrests
LAGA, from page A1
Violence and fighting at clubs is 
something that is very likely to hap
pen when many people come 
through one area like a club, said 
Martin. The club maintains security 
by monitoring their crowd thorough
ly-Weve been good about identify
ing who is going to be a problem and 
we do not allow them back in,i said 
Martin.
Ron Levick feels that it is Hip Hop 
Night itself that was another reason 
for the raid.
They are not happy with Hip Hop 
Night because of the crowd it leaves, 
he said.
Martin describes this crowd as 
being, mostly black and urban. He 
also feels that this could be a good 
reason for the raid.
Hip Hop Night is in Oakland 
which is a college campus and again 
primarily white, so I dont like to play 
the race card, but thats where I see 
the conflict originating from, said 
Martin.
Allison Carney, a sophomore psy
chology student, was also present at 
the raid, but was participating in 
Ceremony, the gothic and industrial 
music event. She agrees with Levicks 
hypothesis that the crowd Hip Hop 
Night attracts is a possible reason for 
the raid.
The crowd that Ceremony attracts 
is mostly white, and I think that the 
owner is onto something. We [at 
Ceremony] were just asked to stay 
inside the club for 45 minutes. We 
were just required to show our IDs on 
our way out, said Carney.
By the time the people from 
Ceremony came out, the patrons of 
Hip Hop Night were all evacuated 
from the area.
I think that the owner is onto 
something. I dont see why K9 units 
are necessary for inspecting a club. 
The police have ulterior motives, 
said Carney.
It is this race issue that makes Ron 
Levick question the power of the 
authorities that raided him last week
end.
The slogan to protect and serve, 
where does that go? Where does that 
stop? I dont understand it.

On February 26, President Jared 
Cohon awarded Robert Langer, 
Kenneth J. Germeshausen Professor 
of Chemical and Biomedical 
Engineering at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, the 2002 
Dickson Prize in Science. Carnegie 
Mellon awards this prize annually to 
individuals in the United States who 
make outstanding contributions to 
science. Upon presenting the award 
to Langer, President Cohen referred 
to him as a true pioneer... reinvent
ing the future of medicine.
Langer has received over 100 
other awards, including the presti
gious Charles Stark Draper Prize 
(which is considered the equivalent 
of the Nobel Prize for engineers) in 
2002 from the National Academy of 
Engineering. After receiving the 
award, Langer gave a presentation 
outlining his major research areas. 
These included drug delivery sys
tems and tissue engineering projects.
He began his talk by describing 
drug delivery in general. The current 
method of drug delivery results in a 
gradual build-up and dissipation of 
the drug from the system. Difficulty 
with the process arises when the 
drug level is too high or when it is 
too low. Too much drug in the sys
tem and safety problems may arise; 
not enough and the dosage is ren
dered ineffective.
Langer has worked toward the 
goal of delivering drugs in the exact 
amount, time, and location wanted. 
He and his team have developed a

A TA ML catalystBack when green chemist Terry 
Collins was a postdoc at Stanford 
deciding what to do with the rest of 
his life, he wanted to find a way to 
replace chlorine in water disinfec
tion. He recognized that the disin
fection process formed organochlorines like chloroform that were com
ing to be recognized at the time as 
carcinogens.
But in the 90s, an even more 
insidious threat from organochlorines would come to light.
Organochlorines, molecules that 
contain carbon and chlorine, have 
been recently brought to public 
attention by Joe Thornton, author of 
Pandoras Poison, who spoke at CMU 
last year. They accumulate in fat, 
and the higher up you are in the food 
chain  the more contaminated ani
mal fat you eat  the more you will 
store in your own body. 
Organochlorines can disrupt the 
endocrine, or hormone, system and 
cause devastating effects in the next 
generation.
The hazards of organochlorines 
require that they be eliminated, 
wrote Collins, now director of CMUs 
Institute for Green Oxidation 
Chemistry, in his review of Pandoras 
Poison in the journal Nature. When 
asked what he thought the most haz

was, Collins immediately replied,

The majority of countries in nego

policies  including a complete ban 
on advertising, carton labels with 
graphic images of smoking-related 
health problems, and elimination of 
words such as mild and light. The

Contributing Editor of an embryo.
In the case that an embryo is 
already-implanted when a woman 
takes ECPs, the pregnancy will 
continue unaltered, and the 
embryo will not be harmed.
Contrary to popular belief, ECPs 
do not induce abortion and are not 
related to Mifepristone or RU-486 
 the so-called abortion pill 
approved by the FDA in 2000. 
Mifepristone chemically induces 
abortion by blocking the bodys 
progesterone receptors, which are 
necessary for pregnancy mainte
nance. ECPs simply prevent 
embryo creation and uterine 
implantation from occurring in the 
first place.
The sooner a woman consumes 
ECPs after unprotected sex, the 
better. If taken within 72 hours, 
progestin-only ECPs reduce the 
risk of pregnancy by 89 percent. If 
taken within 24 hours, they reduce 
the risk by 94 percent.

ECPs reduce the risk of pregnancy 
by 75 percent if taken within 72

Some women experience nau

and/or irregular bleeding after 
taking ECPs.
Symptoms generally do not last 
more than a day or two, and anti
nausea medications taken in con

potential for side effects.
Plan B has proven to greatly 
reduce incidents of nausea and

brands of emergency contracep

caused by contraceptive failure or

contraceptive pills (ECPs) can give 
you or your partner a second 
chance at pregnancy prevention.
Although ECPs have been avail
able in many countries for over 25 
years, they did not receive FDA 
approval until 1997. Limited adver
tising and efforts by Catholicowned hospitals to suppress ECP 
use have left many people in the 
dark about the drugs, commonly 
marketed under the names Preven 
and Plan B.
According to Planned 
Parenthood, widespread use of 
ECPs could prevent 1.7 million 
unintended pregnancies and 
800,000 abortions each year. 
Shadowed by myths and miscon

ECPs are high doses of the hor

NASA extends CMUs lease on west coast campus
by David Newsome
Junior Staffwriter
CMU and NASA have recently 
signed a new lease agreement for the 
CMU west coast campus. CMU West 
has already had a presence since 
2001 at Shenandoah Plaza, which is 
a part of the NASA Ames Research 
Park.
The lease now gives CMU access to 
buildings 23 and 24, which are cur
rently being renovated, for a 15-year 
lease with an option of 48 more 
years and the first preference to 
lease buildings 17 and 20. These are 
the initial steps of the growing pres
ence and expansion of classes and 
research activity at CMU West.
Because of the strong computer 
software programs at CMU, the pres
ence of the west coast campus allows 
a strong working relationship with 
Silicon Valley computer companies, 
active research with NASA, strength
ened ties with some 3,000 alumni in 
the area, and the chance to offer 
software masters degree programs 
for students. NASA began the 
research park on Moffett Field, a 
200-acre former naval facility, and
CMU is the first educational institu
tion with a presence there. The 
expansion allows students from the 
Pittsburgh campus to study and do 
research in Silicon Valley. The main 
research focus is in high-dependability computing.
It gives us greater visibility in the 
Bay area, and that could attract stu
dents to Pittsburgh.... The closer ties 
to the companies could open doors 
to faculty here and possible employ
ment for our students.... We have 
better ties with the alumni. You want 
to nurture the relationship with the 
alumni because you want them to 
participate, said Duane Adams, 
vice-provost of research.
The advantage that CMU can offer 
to NASA and the Silicon Valley com
panies is its strong research ability, 
especially from CS and ECE.
One of the characteristics of 
Carnegie Mellon in general is that 
we are very interdisciplinary, so its 
easy for the research programs and 
the educational programs to cross 
the traditional discipline bound
aries. Some of the most interesting 
projects require people from multi
ple disciplines to collaborate, said 
Adams.
CMU has the culture of working 
on practical problems, so that the 
research done in Pittsburgh and 
CMU West has an overall applied 
purpose, creating technology that 
NASA can use as opposed to purely 
academic projects.
I think that CMU West can help to 
better connect corporate research 
with on-campus research. In my own 
experience, I have identified poten
tial research opportunities while 
scoping the educational needs for 
one of our primary clients, said 
Carol Hoover, a member of the 
Institute for Software Research 
International at CMU.The education 
that CMU offers will be research-oriented, focusing on applied problem 
solving as the main learning tool.
The education and research 
ought to feed off one another. As we 
learn things in the research, it ought 
to work its way into the education. 
We ought to turn to the research to 
find interesting projects, said 
Adams.
The majority of students attending 
the masters program are working 
professionals from nearby computer 
companies. They are taught by facul
ty from CMU Pittsburgh who record
lectures that are then integrated 
with problem-solving work.
The educational programs currendy do not involve traditional class 
work. The students develop skills 
through the accomplishment of taskor project-based activities. They 
acquire background knowledge via 
readings from textbooks and articles 
as well as videotaped main campus 
courses. The students receive 
instructions for their tasks on-line, 
said Hoover.
NASA is taking the lead in this 
combined academic and industrial 
research for improved software and 
is providing the funding. According 
to the joint NASA-CMU press release, 
NASA gave $23.3 million to CMU in 
January 2002 to lead the research 
consortium of five universities in 
high-dependability computing.
NASA is interested [in high 
dependability computing because 
they] had two failures with Mars 
probes that were information-relat
ed.... NASA cant afford these kinds 
of very visible disasters, said 
Adams. The NASA Mars Polar 
Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter 
both failed and were lost in late 
1999.
ECPs not the only way to prevent pregnancy
CONTRACEPTIVES, from page A6
ECPs from Carnegie Mellons 
Student Health Services costs $35, 
and each subsequent prescription is 
$20.
In Pittsburgh, emergency contra
ceptives can also be obtained from 
Magee-Womens Hospital and 
Planned Parenthood.
Users need not wait for an acci
dent to occur to seek out ECPs. Some 
doctors will prescribe them to 
patients to keep at home just in 
case, and for the busy university 
student, an ever-ready back up plan 
could be highly beneficial for you or 
your partner. You never know what 
is going to happen in the heat of the 
moment.
Birth Control Pills Can Double As 
Emergency Contraceptives
Taken in increased doses, many 
common birth control pills can also 
serve as emergency contraceptives. 
During its initial review of emer
gency contraception, the FDA also 
approved the double use of several 
brands of oral contraceptives as 
ECPs.
However, some doctors recom
mend that women seek medical 
advice before self-medicating.
Although their manufacturers do 
not market them as such, the brands 
and doses of birth control pills in the 
following chart can safely and legal
ly double as ECPs.
According to Planned Parenthood, 
the first dose of pills must be taken 
within five days of unprotected sex. 
To avoid vomiting, they recommend 
eating saltines or soda crackers or 
drinking a glass of milk 30 minutes 
before taking each dose. They also 
suggest taking Dramamine or Bonine 
to reduce nausea.
Take the second dose of samebrand pills 12 hours after the first 
dose.
If vomiting occurred after the first 
dose, it is possible to take the second 
dose as a vaginal suppository by 
inserting the pills far into the vagina 
where they will be absorbed through 
the tissue.
If vomiting occurs after the second 
dose, do not take more pills. The risk 
of pregnancy has probably not been 
reduced, and you or your partner 
may want to seek professional med
ical advice.

like organochlorines entirely.
Bleaching is the process that 
Collins is redesigning. Most 
American and European pulp bleach
ing for the paper industry is done 
with chlorine dioxide. Although 
bleaching with chlorine dioxide cre
ates dramatically less dioxin and 
other organochlorines than bleach
ing with elemental chlorine did, it 
still creates some of the harmful 
chemicals, said Collins.
Collins 'uses hydrogen peroxide 
instead, which consists only of hydro
gen and oxygen. But it will not do the 
job on its own  he and his team first 
had to find the proper catalyst for the 
peroxide. A catalyst is important 
because some chemical breakdowns 
take months or years to occur natu
rally,, while a catalyst reacts with the 
target molecule to speed up the 
process greatly. It really took a good 
fifteen years to get the catalyst under 
control, he said. The catalysts the 
group has settled on are tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand (TAML) activa
tors, which are made of hydrogen, 
nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms 
around a reactive metal core, gener
ally iron.
The Collins group then spent six 
years developing the commercial 
angles, of which there are many. 
Bleaching using the activators can be 
done in situations that include laun
dry, pulp and paper, and cleaning up 
effluent from textile and paper mills. 
Collins wrote a paper in Science last 
year about how TAML activators can
even remove organochlorines and 
other absorbable organic halogens 
from such effluent.
Most human misery is caused by 
waterborne pathogens, said Collins. 
He envisions adding hydrogen perox
ide and a bit of catalyst to a drum of 
water in Bangladesh to kill the bacte
ria, protozoa, and viruses within.An 
excerpt from the Institute for Green 
Oxidation Chemistrys website states, 
The technology has an unprecedent
ed ability to destroy certain priority 
chlorinated pollutants from which 
studies it might be concluded that 
TAML-activated peroxide in water 
is the functional equivalent of fire. 
TAMLs also do a really good job 
killing anthrax, said Collins. His 
group received an NSF grant last year 
to develop TAML activators that will 
decontaminate chemical and biologi
cal warfare agents.
TAMLs are not being used in indus
try at the moment, but will be soon. 
Jonathan Spatz, a consultant for 
CMUs Innovation Transfer Center, 
confirmed that about 120 companies 
have shown interest in the technolo
gy-He said that there will be fairly 
large-scale field trials later this year 
and predicts that the TAML will begin 
to be produced sometime next year.
The [use of] TAML compounds is 
an intelligent way to approach the 
technical problem, said Indira Nair, 
vice provost for education. But as 
importantly, Terry has also made an 
ethical leap, she said. He has 
declared sustainability an ethical 
imperative for research chemists.

Letters to the Editor
3 March 2003 THE TARTAN Page A8
Senate nota bene: dont just 
sit there, do something
Senate and the Student Dormitory Council 
sealed the deal this week. The two groups will 
beat their gavels together in a Student Body 
Dining Committee, for a little while at least. 
This polysyllabic joint effort, which also 
includes the Graduate Student Assembly, is 
more a fragment of a past dream than a hope 
for a new future.
Consider the meetings of the committee 
which merely updates what supposedly started 
in October 2000. At that time, SDC and the 
Senate Campus Affairs committee jointly spon
sored a forum to discuss bold new changes in 
meal plans and food. Then, that joint venture 
got together to fix what the students said was 
ailing them. So history repeats itself; the com
plaints are the same, from food quality to price 
to venue to meal plan options.
Its truly a shame that Senate is wasting its 
time so fervently in a time of wide disarray in 
their corridor of student government. They 
debate a resolution to condemn a war in Iraq 
for two straight weeks, with more dithering 
likely in the future. They fumble with dining 
issues that students have not been able to 
resolve for years. Wide rifts separate cliques of 
Senators.
Senate has some simple issues it must 
resolve. The resolutions our campus needs 
right now involve local issues. Begin with din
ing. This problem is clearly out of our hands as 
students, but our collective voices cry in dis
gust at the state of campus dining. Surely the 
mandate from the people is there for Senate to 
simply condemn the state of dining and 
demand that certain standards be met in terms 
of price, quality, and availability. Iraq is so far 
away, yet Daniel Papasian wants his resolution 
to save the world. That seems a bit arrogant, 
and wastefully so.
Denounce the University for dining and 
move on. That mess is going to take more than 
the brains of students to hash out. Indeed, that 
mess may not leave until Parkhurst does. 
Ideally, a conglomerate SDC/Senate govern
ment can oversee dining for further huge blun
ders after the University fixes the situation 
with cash money, but for now a scrip is the best 
students have to offer.
Senate stands poised to repeat its missteps of 
the last two years with the Joint Funding 
Committee. Last year, the information distribu
tion was in disarray, and student groups left 
the meeting confused with hastily-cut budgets. 
This year, hints of the same phenomena are 
already occurring, with student groups sum
moned to mandatory meetings the day before 
the meetings are to commence.
Senate needs to recruit members to its dwin
dling flock. Senate needs to work with SDC; 
join it in fact, but not in a haphazard commit
tee fashion.
Senate would do well to develop some kind 
of ideology on campus affairs, and perhaps cre
ate the vision for a future, stronger Senate 
before it extends its scope to desert countries 
half way around the world. More simply 
addressed issues exist closer to home.
This abject incompetence is nothing new. 
Senate fought endlessly over meaningless leg
islation last year such as the Freedom of 
Information Act, before killing it. Senate hasnt 
been able to hold student interest in a long 
while.
Last semester, senior senators gave up in dis
gust rather than returning for another term, 
including Quinten Steenhuis who is so disgust
ed he wants a coup during elections, and 
Michael Sebetich, ex-vice president of finance, 
who is never without a sharp word on the state 
of Senate.
Theres really quite a ruckus in their meet
ings now. Papasian thinks his anti-war resolu
tion got routed by dirty tricks two weeks ago; 
see his rant on Indymedia.org. This week, after 
Papasian decided his motion would get batted 
down after opposition from Brian Namey in 
Thursdays Senate meeting, he withdrew it to 
fight another day. Hats off to Namey if he did in 
fact skillfully stop Papasians huge waste of 
time, dirty tricks or not. Too bad he didnt 
quash this whole dining thing, too.Identity theft Xpress is out of 
the station, and back at CMU
Carnegie Mellon continues to fail to protect 
the privacy of its students by continuing to use 
social security numbers (SSNs) for student IDs. 
The dilapidated student records system, creat
ed over 15 years ago, uses SSNs to cross-reference information about students, such as 
grades, SAT scores, and financial aid informa
tion. Two years ago, the University requested 
that campus cash registers stop printing stu
dent IDs with every purchase, but the software 
has yet to be implemented.
Carnegie Mellons administration has been 
indecisive in effectively resolving the problem. 
The self-proclaimed world-leading university 
in technology has been unable to devise a new 
student records system, even though discus
sions have been in the works for at least two 
years.
Confusion seems to exist within both the 
administration and the vague vaporware of the 
new student records system.
While Carnegie Mellon has been slow to 
change, other universities have taken proactive 
action. Boston University moved away using 
SSNs in 1998.
Enrollment Services constantly provides 
SSNs to a variety of on-campus and off-campus 
organizations without the authorization of stu
dents, a possible violation of the Family 
Education Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) of 
1974 that severely limits how SSNs can be post
ed and distributed. Some states have passed 
additional legislation reducing the use of SSN 
in educational institutions; Arizona banned all 
use of SSNs.
The University has made some progress in 
protecting students SSNs, but has been drasti
cally ineffective. Enrollment Services has pro
moted policies that discourage the use of SSNs 
and now bans them from being publicly post
ed.
To prevent fraudulent purchases, tough poli
cies have been enacted that force clerks to ask 
for a form of identification with a SSN and dis
courage verbal communication of SSNs. 
However, these policies are rarely enforced. 
Even at the HUB, students must still give their 
SSN verbally to receive assistance.
Though FERPA made it illegal to post student 
grades with SSNs, The Tartan reported 467 
SSNs being mass-emailed with grades to a 
Principles of Economics class in 2001. Too fre
quently, SSNs are provided to on-campus 
groups to use as an authorization code. A vari
ety of unsecured servers use SSNs as default 
passwords, which in the servers are linked to an 
Andrew ID.
With this ID, an identity thief could easily 
find more information on the internet.
Enrollment Services provides students with 
the option of having an auto-generated number 
as their student ID, with the disclaimer that it 
may cause problems with financial aid. The 
process for a single student takes up to three 
weeks to complete, and in March of 2001 it was 
estimated that the process of converting all stu
dent IDs to auto-generated numbers could take 
up to six months.
Even then, the University took an overly con
servative approach to resolving the issue. Two 
years later, Entropy registers are still spewing out 
social security numbers as the University fails to 
take quick action.
And the University gives all students social 
security numbers to CampusLink, CMUs long 
distance provider for Housing residents.

* Denotes acting position
Dain Pascocello
Freedom is getting a second chance in our 
nations capital. Thats the hope, at least, of 
the six plaintiffs in the court case Parker v. 
District of Columbia. They are asking a fed
eral judge to prevent D.C. from enforcing 
the 1976 handgun ban, a clear example of 
constitution-trampling. The 25-plus-yearold catch-all prohibits even the registration 
of handguns within the District. 
Furthermore, pistols registered prior to that 
date cannot even be carried from room to 
room in a home without a license. And 
theres more. All firearms within a house, 
including hunting rifles and shotguns, must 
be unloaded at all times, broken up into 
their constituent parts, or defanged by trig
ger lock. The result is a law which proscribes 
anyone, criminal and law-abiding citizen 
alike, from legally owning a functioning gun 
in their homes. Should Shelly Parker, the 
lead plaintiff in the case, seek to own a 
firearm for protection or safety, she could be 
subject to fines, arrest, and incarceration. 
Parker, by the way, lives in a particularly 
crime-ridden area of D.C. and is worried 
about drug dealers, car thieves, and bur
glars targeting her and her loved ones. Her 
crime is caring about the community in 
which she lives; an infraction, it turns out,
punishable in the District.
Its not as if the gun ban in D.C. stresses 
collective rights over individual ones as 
more current court rulings have. Its just 
that the District of Columbia hates guns and 
will do everything in its power to keep lawabiding tax-payers away from them. Crime, 
meanwhile, is rampant  D.C. has rarely 
ever been a safe place to vacation or live  
and citizens are at the mercy of crooks, in 
the streets and in seats of power.
And all of this occurs while our 
Department of Justice states unmistakably 
the right of citizens to keep and bear their 
arms. In a letter to the National Rifle 
Association, Attorney General John 
Ashcroft reaffirmed a long-held opinion 
that all law-abiding members of this society 
should be protected by the text and the 
original intent of the Second Amendment. 
The Justice Department followed shortly 
thereafter with a brief to the Supreme Court 
in the recent United States v. Emerson litiga
tion. The federal government, in a first, 
argued in court documents that the Second 
Amendment broadly protects the rights of 
individuals, including persons who are not 
members of any militia ... subject to reason
able restrictions designed to prevent posses
sion by unfit persons or to restrict the pos
session of types of firearms that are particu
larly suited to misuse. The Emerson case 
was. ruled in favor of the government  
Emerson was convicted of domestic vio
lence some years prior and as such the High 
Court decided that certain restrictions on
his gun ownership could apply. A welter of 
legal scholars support this interpretation, 
liberal to conservative, strict to broad con
structionist. Harvard Law Schools 
Lawrence Tribe, no stranger to liberal caus
es, and Yales more conservative Akhil Amar 
agree on the fundamentals: the Second 
Amendment represents an individual right, 
rather than just a collective right, and that 
this right, being subject to reasonable and 
sober regulatory measures, is not absolute.
But nothing about the D.C. ban is reason
able or justified. Just have a look at the 
other plaintiffs in the Parker case: one, a 
Special Police Officer who carries a hand
gun regularly as he patrols the Thurgood 
Marshall Center. But when he wished to 
carry a gun in his home, the government 
Stepped in. Evidently, as long as our law 
enforcement and National Guardsmen carry 
weapons, the District of Columbia considers 
us safe.
Another plaintiff is a gay man who was 
arrested under the 1976 law after he used 
his firearm to fend off an attacker. At the 
time, the man was being targeted and 
accosted because of his sexual orientation. 
No matter, though; in the District of 
Columbia, the constitutional right to protect 
oneself takes a back seat to provincial poli
tics. Until we get past the unproven notion 
that gun ownership leads to an increase in 
gun deaths, freedom will never get its day in 
court.

CMU ought to shun UMichs race position
I am offended by CMU President Jared 
Cohons decision to support the University 
of Michigans racial preference policy 
regarding University admissions. Michigans 
policy gives 20 points (out of 150 total) for 
applicants who belong to certain racial 
groups.
A perfect SAT score is only given 14 
points! Michigans sole justification for this 
policy is that it is for the sake of diversity. 
This sends a message to students that race is 
more important than intelligence and 
achievement. Regardless of how they
phrase it, unqualified applicants are being 
accepted and qualified applicants are not 
being accepted because of this policy. A stu
dents grades often depend on the abilities 
of other students in their group projects. 
Students should not need to worry about 
whether their teammates meet the academ
ic standards for admission and retention. 
Scholarships and job offers depend on 
grades.
Therefore, this exercise in social engi
neering causes a resentful climate on cam
pus. Conversely, unfair resentment is cast 
upon students of the chosen racial groups 
who do riot need the lowered standards. 
Plenty of universities exist for less-intelligent applicants  no one is being deprived
of an education. Students find diversity on 
campus without the existence of this double 
standard, in addition to the diversity they 
find in their social/professional activities 
and through the media. Our Universitys 
name and our administrations time should 
not be used to advance such a racist policy. 
Perhaps these outside activities are part of 
the reason why CMUs tuition has been ris
ing so ridiculously fast. If some administra
tors really think that diversity is so impor
tant, why dont they resign their jobs in 
favor of the applicants who didnt score as 
well as they did?

Beware the idiots 
of March: CMU 
has its fair share
Hboemtenf ky Aimtegr
Generally, we columnists choose one topic a week in 
order to more succinctly make fools of ourselves. 
However, over the course of time, we run across a few 
topics that dont warrant full-length pieces. Rather than 
let the most important person in my life (thats you, dear 
reader) miss out on these items, Ive taken it upon myself 
to provide some important analysis.
Last week, The Tartan reported on the new coopera
tive housing to be formed next year. Tired of living in the 
wasteful, tyrannical, and toxic environment that is the 
campus dorm, these avengers of campus inequality will 
form a democratic co-op that focuses on sustainable 
and environmentally friendly living.
In exchange for taking care of things themselves  
like buying their own food and changing light bulbs  
members get their housing rate reduced by around $900. 
Remind me to get a job at Carnegie Mellon if they pay 
people so much to change light bulbs.
I cant wait to see the fun ensue with this one. The 
members will sign a lease as a group, not as individuals. 
A great way to run any organization is to structure it so 
that individuals cannot be held responsible. One won
ders what happens when Chip doesnt buy the organical
ly-grown lettuce or when he refuses to sign yet another 
resolution from the 617 Neville Street Collective against 
war in Iraq.
Speaking of fun, the forces of good are hard at work at 
Carnegie Mellon to prevent people from having any. 
Michael Croland lectured last week on the evils of dirty 
and inappropriate pictures in magazines at the 
University bookstore.
Im glad Croland brought this to our attention. We 
shouldnt buy dirty magazines from the bookstore. Its 
wrong. We can get a lot of hardcore porn for free on the 
Internet. If you really want to expand your collection, 
pool your money with some other people, buy one sub
scription to a website, and then write a script to auto
matically download new pictures and mirror them on 
your own server.
Just dont think about having a smoke after spanking 
Mr. or Ms. Winky. SDC voted to ban smoking in all cam
pus dorms to both improve the lives of non-smokers and 
provide entertainment for them. Theyll be able to watch 
smokers go outside, way outside, to smoke in subzero 
temperatures.
Of course, this isnt so bad. Smoking is dangerous and 
can start fires. Fireworks can start fires, too, as we wit
nessed with the unfortunate Rhode Island nightclub fire 
during a Great White concert.
I hope we all learn something very important from this 
tragic event, namely that smoke-induced asphyxiation 
and being burned alive have joined crappy music and 
untalented performers as good reasons not to go to a 
Great White concert.
On the political front, the nation was shocked last 
week when sophomore Tolga Erbay revealed in his letter 
to the editor that our government only takes actions to 
benefit or protect the American people. Lobbyists, 
political action committees, and special interest groups 
were seen leaving Washington, D.C., by the thousands. 
Gosh, wed never want to interfere with that, one wellintentioned beltway bandit claimed. My sources tell me 
that Erbay may soon release a new study showing that 
politicians do things for the greater good of the country, 
not to get re-elected.
And while were on the subject of doing things in the 
interests of constituents, lets have a brief chat about 
GSLA. Dean Dunn has expanded the 3/2 programs to 
now include IS majors.
Having 20 or so inexperienced MBA students from CIT 
wasnt enough, so the administration decided to throw 
in some more. In a few years, recruiters can ask such 
interview questions as: Why the hell am I talking to a 
kid with no business experience?
A few students have voiced concern over this to the 
newly-formed student government at GSIA. They have 
about a dozen vice presidents there, so I figure they 
might find someone to pass along some vague, conde
scending, and utterly pointless explanation from the 
Dean,.
They have enough VPs running around that they 
should create a VP of Vague, Condescending, and 
Pointless Explanations From the Dean.
On the other hand, though, Im starting to believe this 
may not be such a bad idea. My two-and-a-half-year-old 
son is very smart. He knows all his letters and can count 
up to 30 (well, 20 ten as he calls it). At the rate GSIA is 
diluting the value of the MBA program, theyll probably 
be admitting elementary school kids by the time my son 
enters the first grade. The only drawback is that my 
loans will not be paid off by then.
Christian M. Restifo is a tick.ed.-off third-year Flex-Time 
MBA student at GSIA.
Mardi Gras, the two-week-long pre-Lenten festival, ends on March 4, traditionally known as Fat Tuesday. 
The massive party boasts its fair share of drinking, nudity, and general debauchery, making it prime territo

This week's guest writer:
Ken Krawchuk __
Operation: Insane Drug War
Like some demented madman from an old B movie, John Ashcroft 
came swooping out of the sky last week to harangue and harass the 
peaceful citizens of communities large and small across the United 
States. When the dust finally settled, 55 Americans found themselves 
under arrest in the name of Ashcrofts equally-demented war on 
drugs.
Their crime wasnt even possession or use of drugs. These 
upstanding American business owners were arrested simply for being 
American business owners. They sold pipes and papers  parapher
nalia, in the lexicon of the demented  in local shops or over the 
Internet. But now theyre under arrest and facing years in prison. In a 
land thats known for freedom, how can such a thing be fair? 
Immediately, Ashcrofts dementia raises constitutional questions. If it 
took a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol, wouldnt you think 
Ashcroft would need a constitutional amendment to ban mere pipes?
Another question is whos going to foot the bill? Is John Ashcroft 
going to pay the exorbitant $5-10 million dollar prison bill resulting 
from his latest folly? Will he be holding a bake sale or car wash, or 
does he expect us taxpayers to shell out the bucks for keeping 55 
innocent business owners in prison?
Id have no complaint about taxpayers covering such a huge prison 
bill if these entrepreneurs had committed an actual crime, but this is 
simply not the case. They were not even selling pot itself, just pipes 
and papers.
Does he also expect the taxpayers to cover the cost of prosecution? 
What about the added cost of calling in the local police? And will he
pay us taxpayers back for the time hes wasted grandstanding on TV 
while real criminals and terrorists still run free?
Other questions abound. Our prisons are already filled past capac
ity  what hoodlums will Ashcroft turn loose on society to make 
room for his latest kills?
Already almost one-third of the people heading to Pennsylvania 
prisons are drug war casualties, costing Pennsylvanians alone almost 
a half a billion dollars a year to keep them all there. Nationally, the 
cost runs far into the billions. No wonder prisons are so overcrowded 
and taxes so high. Looking to the future, will Ashcroft now waste 
more of our hard-earned tax dollars closing down local convenience 
stores that sell similar items in the area? Are they targeted for the 
same taxpayer-funded harassment?
Most importantly, what about the 55 business owners whose lives 
and livelihood Ashcroft has just ruined? How does he plan to make it 
up to them and their families? Its obvious to anyone that Ashcroft 
has gone way too far in prosecuting his insane war on drugs, and its 
we taxpayers who are left to foot the bill.
As shown by Ashcrofts latest indiscretion, its way past time that 
our elected officials got their priorities straight. So if youve had it 
with the ruined lives and wasted tax dollars, send them a message 
that they cant ignore. The time has come to register and vote 
Libertarian. No other political party is committed to ending this 
insane war on drugs and returning us to the rule of law that weve 
strayed so far from.
Vote Libertarian! How else can you expect things to change? 
Because if you keep voting the way youve been voting, youll keep on 
getting just what youve been getting. And I dont know about you, 
but I have had enough!

Pot not a threat, but law should stand
e9 7,Is 2707w.tfi
Colin Holloway
In another proud Pittsburgh moment, 
local and federal authorities, acting on the 
whim of Attorney General John Ashcroft, 
centered their latest assault on drugs on 
local paraphernalia emporiums such as 
Tela Ropa and Heads & Threads. While 
many students cry out against the action, I 
must say that it is about time the govern
ment took a stand in the war on drugs.
Dont get me wrong, I wholeheartedly 
feel that marijuana should be legal, but it 
isnt, and until the U.S. government 
acknowledges the argument that college 
kids like me are safer smoking copious 
amounts of weed than consuming the vast 
quantities of alcohol we do, those who rock 
the ganja are doing so illegally. Following
the logical progression, those who purchase 
and own items which make aforementioned 
rocking possible are also breaking the law.
Whether the law is right or wrong, fair or 
unfair, cool or un-cool, it is still the law and 
the job of lawmen like Ashcroft to uphold 
and enforce it.
I understand, and even tend to support, 
the arguments against this seemingly ran
dom drug crusade. However, after hearing 
them, Im left wondering, Wheres the 
beef? In other words, how realistic are 
these arguments? Keith Stroup, director of 
the National Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws, has been the public voice 
against Ashcroft and his law enforcement 
cohorts. He argues that the attorney general 
is nothing more than a right-wing zealot, 
and This latest enforcement initiative is pri
marily an expression of extremism.
Again, I refer Stroup and those who agree 
with this argument to the fact that it is 
Ashcrofts job to fight the war on drugs. Ill 
be the first to agree that this countrys drug
Elizabeth Levin/Art Staff
policy is full of flaws. Our prisons have 
filled up from drug-related crimes and sec
tions of our cities have become war zones 
between rival gangs whose drug empires 
have grown on the money from kids who 
purchase their illegal wares.
The governments policy is a moralistic 
crusade against drugs, but one that is kept 
in check because the government cannot 
pursue the masters of the drug trade with
out violating the civil liberties guaranteed 
to U.S. citizens. While this hard-line policy 
makes sense against harder drugs, I agree 
that it is baffling to use it against marijuana.
However, this is the policy. It is the attor
ney generals job to uphold it, and to do so is 
not an expression of extremism. In fact, 
Im comforted by the fact that law enforce
ment is doing what they are sworn to do: to 
uphold the law and to protect the public. As 
harmless as pot is compared to alcohol, and 
as socially acceptable as it has become on

Come on everyone, lets walk over to 
the Smith house, put on the game, and 
eat some hamburgers and apple pie.
Smith is, and will remain, a wonder
fully American surname, but when it is 
time for the national anthem, please 
lower your head in shame.
If that doesnt sound right to you, 
then what Toni Smith, a senior forward 
with the Manhattanville womens bas
ketball team, is doing will not sit well 
either.
All season, Smith has turned her back 
on her countrys flag during the anthem 
in pre-game ceremonies.
Smith has mixed her personal politics 
with her colleges athletics program. In 
a statement on Thursday, February 20, 
Smith said, For some time now, the 
inequalities that are embedded into the 
American system have bothered me. As 
they are becoming progressively worse 
and it is clear that the governments pri
orities are not on bettering the quality 
of life for all of its people, but rather on 
expanding its own power, I cannot, in 
good conscience, salute the flag.
This young lady is democracy in 
action  boldly embodying her cause 
and ignoring the stupidity of her stance.
While I acknowledge her right to 
protest and appreciate her courageous 
efforts, her reasons and the places she 
picks to enact her political critiques are 
misguided and inappropriate. If Smith 
really believed the governments priori
ties are in expanding its own power, 
then maybe Miss Smith should not have 
been staring at the floor so hard during 
the playing of the national anthem 
through the last year and a half follow
ing September 11.
If she did her homework, as any soci
ology major should, she would see that 
the FBI and CIA have simply had the 
powers which were stripped from them 
by prior administrations, i.e. Clintons, 
restored to levels where they.could per
haps help ward off the next 9-11.
Establishing a Homeland Security 
Department, increasing the supplies of 
smallpox vaccinations, paying out bil
lions of dollars to 9-11 victims, sending 
voluntary troops out to less-advanced 
countries to duke it out in the rocks and 
sand, paying off the airline industry so 
that Americans could continue to travel, 
and cutting taxes to better the economy 
are the actions of a government inter
ested in bettering the quality of life for

Smiths flagging patriotism is misguidedCrack down 
on pot sad 
but necessary
PIPES, from page A9
college campuses across the country, I would 
argue that parents dont want their young 
teenagers growing up on the stuff. When para
phernalia is readily available in stores and 
online, it becomes very easy for kids to think 
pot is cool. This type of thing is dangerous 
because kids are impressionable. The fact 
remains that any drug, no matter how harm
less in small doses, can ruin someone when it 
becomes a way of life. John Ashcrofts actions 
are not those of a right-wing zealot, but of 
someone who is taking action against those 
who openly engage in illegal activities.
Another argument made by Stroup is that 
the country has more important issues to 
worry about. He protested the action by say
ing, At a time when the rest of the country is 
worried about terrorism, this attorney general 
is going after people who sell pipes.... Surely 
he has something better to do with his time.
Again, I cannot agree with this line of rea-, 
soning. I have always argued that before a 
country can worry about what goes on outside 
its borders it must take care of the home front. 
This is not a case of the Bush administration 
wasting their time and resources; rather, it is a 
sign that Bushs dedication to Iraq will not 
cause him to forget about the countrys other 
problems. To Mr. Stroup I ask, why is it that a 
government should only focus on one thing? 
Just because an issue of vast importance looms 
at the top of Bushs to-do list  namely, ter-* 
rorism  does not mean all other things 
should be forgotten.
The Attorney General has an obligation to 
protect and uphold the laws of this country, and 
it is nice to know that, while the Iraq conflict 
seems to dominate the headlines, other issues 
are being taken care of. I can understand the 
outcry against Ashcrofts action, but the argu
ments dont seem to hold any water. As much as 
people such as Keith Stroup complain about this 
crackdown, those who were indicted deserved 
to be. They were breaking the law. There is no 
room for debate.
The government does not need to abandon 
everything to focus on Iraq, and I personally feel 
a sense of relief seeing that the Bush administra
tion has not forgotten about the issues that exist 
on American soil. Yes, the choice of drugs as the 
issue to crack down on seems trivial, but that is 
not the issue in this debate. Marijuana is still ille
gal, pipes and bongs are also still illegal, and 
those who sell them deserve to be prosecuted  
no questions asked.
Colin Holloway (colinh@) is a junior decision 
science major, and suggests that if you dont like, 
his column you can use it as rolling paper.
all of its people. Now, Smith would 
love to ignore all these actions; she 
would love to state how horrible we 
are; and she would love to march up 
and down the streets chanting, Not in 
our name.
She would love to do all of those 
things, but instead she has chosen to 
turn her back on the American flag.
The American flag is not a symbol of 
the policy-making decisions of the 
Bush administration. The American 
flag is a beacon of freedom and hope.
The flag is a marker for a society 
where all are welcome and where 
everyone has an opportunity to do 
something great. After all, we do not 
see entrepreneurs fleeing to Iraq for a 
better opportunity to make their for
tunes.
What am I thinking? I am acting so 
silly. This country is of course only 
interested in advancing its own power.
We are largely bankrolling the 
efforts to save the starving in many 
countries such as Ethiopia, 
Afghanistan, and North Korea.
We give billions of dollars in aid to 
terrorist regimes while we still have 
children and homeless shivering in the 
streets. We are the most altruistic coun
try that God ever presented to Earth.
The flag stands for more than war on 
Iraq, and Smith should pay it respect 
and continue her protest through sepa
rate means.
One can only sit and wonder if Smith 
receives a financial aid package that 
contains federal loans, work-study, or 
grants. If her aid package did contain 
any of those items, would Smith view 
them as imperialistic buyoffs and 
promptly return them? One can only 
hope she would stand so strong in her 
convictions.
As truculent and seemingly con
temptuous as Smiths actions are, they 
at least help bring true American spirit 
to the forefront. At the end of a game, 
in which Smiths Manhattanville lost to 
Mount St. Marys, the crowd sang God 
Bless America. At another game a 
Vietnam War veteran came out of the 
stands and waved a flag in front of 
Smiths face during a stoppage of play. 
How wonderful, one might say; a 
protest and a counter-protest all in one 
night.
What do we do about the Vietnam 
veteran showing patriotism during a 
games intermission? This particular 
American patriot was escorted from 
the building.

LaGrange College 61, Einory 59 
The Eagles staged a furious late 
rally to come back from 12 down to 
tie LaGrange (11-15) at 53 with 
2:20 remaining. After falling behind 
again, Emory tied the game at 59 on 
a three-pointer by Beth Byron with 
15 seconds to play only to see 
LaGrange win it with a buzzer-beater by Karey Howard.
Saturday, March 1
CWRU 63, Emory 60 
Emory blew a huge second-half 
lead in the last game of coach Myra 
Simss 15-year career. Down 56-38,
the Spartans went on a 19-2 run to 
take the lead for good. Jasmine 
Rowan had a game-high 18 points 
for Case Western.
NYU 75, Brandeis 61 
The Violets dominated the Judges 
to finish the season on a six-game 
winning streak. NYU blew open a 
close game midway through the first 
half with a 10-0 run that gave them a 
25-15 lead that Brandeis was unable 
to overcome despite Lisa Pretzlaffs 
game-high 24 points. Up 11 at the 
half, NYU stretched the lead to as 
much as 17 and never let it slip 
below eight.
Washington 83, Chicago 54
Sophomore Hallie Hutchens and 
senior Jennifer Rudis scored double
doubles as Washington routed the 
Maroons late Sunday. With their 
29th straight win over Chicago, 
Washington earns the UAAs auto

Emerson College 75, Brandeis 71 
The' Judges' struggles continued 
against Emerson (8-17) as their los
ing streak reached eight games. 
Bryan Lambert had a team-high 18 
points for Brandeis, and Ben 
Bosanac added 14, but Rob 
Hennigan almost single-handedly 
gave Emerson the win with 34 
points.
Wednesday, February 26
Emory 83, Stillman College 78 
The Eagles abandoned all pre
tense of a well-rounded offense, but 
were able to hold on against 
Stillman. Three players, Rashawn 
Allen, Chase Fawsett, and Clayton 
Fuller, accounted for more than 75
percent of Emorys total points with
24, 22, and 20 points, respectively. 
Strong free throw shooting bailed 
out the Eagles on a poor shooting 
day, which included a 1-12 showing 
from Seun Abolaji.
Saturday, March 1
Emory 81, CWRU 64 
Emory finished their season on a 
high note, winning their last four 
games including the finale over Case 
Western. The late streak allowed the 
Eagles to tie their best season record 
in the past 12 years. Chase Fawsett 
led Emory with 27 points, his third 
straight game scoring over 20. He 
also added 10 rebounds for his third 
double-double in the past four 
games.
NYU 99, Brandeis 78 
The Violets avoided finishing the 
season at the bottom of the UAA 
standings by beating the Judges. 
NYU scored the first 10 points of the 
game, and jumped out to an early 17 
point lead before blowing it late in 
the first half. After rallying to lead by 
seven at the break, NYU posted the 
first six points of the second half and 
led by as many as 26. Jeff Gilkerson 
and James Janeczek each scored 23 
points for NYU, who posted their 
highest score of the season.
Washington 85, Chicago 50 
The Bears rebounded from a loss 
last week to win the UAA champi
onship over the Maroons. 
Washington took advantage of long 
streaks at the end of the first half 
and containment of Chicago star for
ward Derek Reich to take a 31-19 
halftime lead. The streak following 
halftime saw Washington score 19 
unanswered points. Washington 
earns the UAA bid to the NCAA 
Division III tournament.

American League predictions: West is best
PREVIEW, from page A12
Yankees win, Red Sox finish a disap
pointing second, and no one else 
even bothers to show up.
The addition of Hedeki Matsui and 
Todd Zeile completes the Yankees 
lineup, and Ive been over their 
embarrassing glut of starting pitch
ers. Basically, there arent any flaws 
in this team, and itll take a remark
able effort for anyone to beat them.
At this point, I feel quite sorry for 
Boston, I really do. Theyve done 
everything they can to keep up with 
the Evil Empire, as the Yankees 
have been called in Bean town lately, 
but nothings working. Getting either 
Colon or Jose Contreras would have 
been a tremendous boost, but, 
instead, Boston will have to keep rely
ing on Pedro Martinez and hope that

Brendan Shanahan. For fear of mak
ing a list of every geezer on skates 
today, a few other big names who will 
soon be hitting golf balls instead of 
pucks include Brian Leetch, Mark 
Messier (who was playing when 
Jimmy Carter was president), Adam 
Oates, Doug Gilmour, and Mathieu 
Schneider.
Most teams employing talented 
veteran players will hot be affected 
greatly by impending retirements. 
Mario Lemieux may be the only per
son whose departure can alter both a 
teams and a citys landscape for years 
to come. More often these days, 
unfortunately, teams decide when a 
players time is-up in the franchise. 
Organizations now plan for years in 
advance to ensure reliable infusion of 
youth into their lineups. The NFL pre
sents the most glaring examples in 
Jerry Rice, Bruce Smith, and recently, 
Emmitt Smith, but no professional 
sports league is free from blame. 
Salary cap issues play too much of a 
factor now in who stays and who 
goes. Financial reasons will expedite 
retirement decisions, so watch the 
greats while you still can.
Nikhil Sinha (ansinha@) is looking 
forward to watching Michael Jordan in 
person for the second, and probably 
last, time over midsemester break.
Derek Lowes 20-win season was no 
fluke. Offensively, the Red Sox can 
get better by keeping Manny Ramirez 
healthy, but considering that they 
were second in the league in runs last 
year (behind the Yankees, naturally), 
that isnt a huge concern.
The bottom feeders in the East are 
slightly better than those in the 
Central, if only because only one of 
them lost 100 games or more. The sit
uation in Toronto is remarkably simi
lar to the one in Chicago, and if the 
Blue Jays were in the Central, they 
might be competitive. As it is, though, 
theyll battle with the horribly mis
managed Orioles for the pride that 
can come only with third place.
This brings us once again to the 
most pathetic franchise in the history 
of professional sports. I swear that 
the Washington Generals have to
have more hope on any given day 
than the Devil Rays. Every day that 
this team continues not to be con
tracted is an insult to the sport.
Overall
The Yankees will win in a runaway 
and Minnesota will pull away from 
Chicago sometime in early August. As 
for the West, you heard it here first: a 
resurgent Mariners squad takes 
advantage of the Angels champi
onship hangover to return to the 
playoffs. In a race that hopefully will 
go down to the wire, Oakland repeats 
as champion with Seattle claiming 
the Wild Card.
Tune in later as Matt Brun (mbrun@) 
returns after mid-semester break with 
a fearless look at the National League.

THE TARTAN3 March 2003
Swiss yacht takes 
the Americas Cup
Id like to preface these previews 
with a line from ESPN, corns Tuesday 
Morning Quarterback, also occasion
ally known as Gregg Easterbrook, All 
predictions wrong or your money 
back. That said, here are some notso-official American League pre
views.
Despite the obvious handicap of 
being landlocked, a team from 
Switzerland took the Americas cup 
Sunday in New Zealand. The Swiss 
yacht Alinghi beat the two-time 
defending champion Team New 
Zealand 5-0. The club that owns the 
yacht, the Geneva Nautical Society, 
was filled with over 500 spectators, 
including billionaire Ernesto 
Bertarelli, who backed their run. Six 
television feeds were provided for 
fans to watch the two-hour race, 
which ended in the middle of the 
Swiss night.
The Swiss teams practice their runs 
on Lake Geneva, and there are four 
gold-medal teams from this club
house.
This is the first time in the 152-year 
history of the sailing series that the 
Cup will go to Europe.
Plans for the boat to be transported 
by airplane to Geneva for the celebra
tion have been scrapped due to the 
prohibitive cost.
West Division
This is by far the most interesting 
division in the AL if only because it 
has more than one team consistently 
in the hunt for the postseason. Over 
the past three seasons, the West 
Division has produced all of the AL 
Wild Card teams, and every team has 
been in the postseason at least once 
since 1999.
The division appears to still be in 
fine shape. The world-champion 
Angels didnt make any major moves 
in the offseason, losing and replacing 
a few role players, but no big names. 
One thing to watch will be how quick
ly Tim Salmon recovers from his off
season knee surgery. This division 
will be so competitive that Anaheim 
cant afford a slow start, and a third 
bat supporting Garret Anderson and 
Troy Glaus would be a big help.
With the possible 
exception of
Salmon, the rest of 
Anaheims core roster from last year is -S
intact. It would have 
been nice to see the 
Angels get a definite Tp|f/ mM(/
fourth and fifth J|[||mw
starter, but han- Ifiililii
dling the positions gH ffiulal
by committee WBGwKf
worked just fine last ^srotlJ^o
year. The strength 
of the pitching staff is the bullpen 
anyway, and it should be even 
stronger this year if Francisco 
Rodriguez shows that his 5-1 record 
with a 1.93 ERA in the playoffs was 
no fluke.
The major competition in the West 
will once again come from Oakland, 
who will be looking for their third 
division tide in four years. Like the 
Angels, Oakland didnt make any 
major changes in the offseason, stick
ing with the theory that if it aint 
broke, dont fix it.
Oakland will be especially hungry, 
since they must realize that their win
dow of opportunity is drawing to a 
close. They have the best young trio 
of pitchers anywhere in Barry Zito, 
Mark Mulder, and Tim Hudson, but 
as a small-market team, they wont be 
able to afford them forever. The As 
want to win now, and all thats left is 
to put it all together in the playoffs.
Just behind the two California 
teams, but definitely still in the hunt, 
are the Seattle Mariners. A year after 
their record-setting 116-win cam
paign, the Mariners fell back to earth 
last year, finishing six games out of

Paterno wants Pitt 
as 12th in Big Ten
Penn State head football coach Joe 
Paterno reiterated on Sunday that he 
would like another team added to the 
Big Ten and that he would be pleased 
if it could be Penn States old rival, 
the University of Pittsburgh.
Under his proposal/the Big Ten 
would be reorganized under the 
NCAA rule which allows conferences 
with 12 or more schools to split into 
two divisions. Penn State and Pitt 
would be joined by Ohio State and 
three other schools, likely Michigan, 
Michigan State, and either Purdue or 
Indiana, in the eastern division of the 
conference.
If Pitt will not jump from the Big 
East, however, Paterno favors the 
addition of Syracuse University.
While Penn State and Pitt have 
played each other in football 96 
times, they have never been in the 
same division for that sport and have 
not played since the 2000 season 
when the Panthers beat the Nittany 
Lions 12-0 at Three Rivers Stadium. 
Recently, Pitt rejected Penn States 
offer to extend the series with a twoto-one home game ratio in favor of 
PSU.

Penguins season right now, and 
game attendance figures will be 
directly affected if Lemieux calls it 
quits. Mario will have to weigh pub
lic sentiment with personal inter
ests, especially because, as the 
Penguins owner, his decisions 
affect the clubs ability to stay 
afloat.
Similar scenarios surround long
time Rangers goalie Mike Richter, 
who has been sidelined with con
cussion problems.
There are a few notable defensemen who have been around NHL 
rinks since the early 1980s, and it 
can only be a matter of time before 
these grizzled veterans don their 
sweaters for the last time. New 
Jerseys Scott Stevens, St. Louiss Al 
Maclnnis, and Detroits Chris 
Chelios were already playing in the 
big league when I was born. Stevens 
has been a rugged player and is the 
only person in NHL history to have 
played more than 600 games with 
two different franchises (the Caps 
and the Devils). The day Maclnnis 
retires is the day that goalies and 
shot blockers will rejoice; Maclnnis 
may be a reliable defensemen, but 
he is famed for having arguably the 
hardest shot in the league.
Chelios plays on a Red Wings 
team laden with players so old they 
could join the AARP as soon as they 
retire. Steve Yzerman, Detroits 
beloved captain, recently returned 
from major off-season knee surgery. 
Stevie Ys been in Hockeytown since 
1981. Other teammates who have 
been around for more than fifteen 
years include Brett Hull, Igor 
Larionov, Luc Robataille, and
East DivisionGeorgia coaches 
targeted by NCAA
Former Georgia basketball player 
Tony Cole told the Atlanta press on 
Sunday, March 2, that coach Jim 
Harrick gave him a credit card to buy 
a television. Cole also claims that a 
Georgia basketball booster gave 
him as much as $900, including $300 
for a shopping spree, and that other 
players have received similar bene
fits.
Further charges include allegations 
that Jim Harrick Jr., assistant coach 
on the team, perpetrated academic 
fraud and paid other expenses for 
players. The younger Harrick has 
been suspended pending an investi
gation by the university and the 
NCAA.
I considered just cutting and past
ing this segment from any of the past 
four of these previews that Ive writ
ten, since its always the same:
A couple of weekends ago I went 
to Mellon Arena with four friends to 
watch the Penguins, and mainly 
Mario Lemieux, for the first time. 
Number 66 scored a goal in a losing 
effort, and I was glad I got to see an 
all-time great in action before he 
hung up the skates again for good. 
Increasingly in sports these days, 
athletes flirt with retirement before 
coming back to play the game they 
love, for better or for worse. We 
have seen comebacks on both ends 
of the quality spectrum, from Mario 
Lemieux and Michael Jordan to 
poor Trey Junkin. One thing is for 
certain, however: athletes in the 
most physically-demanding sports, 
such as hockey and football, tend to 
stay retired once they leave the 
game. Lemieux has been a fantastic 
exception, but even he has hinted 
that this season could be his last.
Fans often try to be the judge of 
when athletes are past their prime, 
have proven everything they have 
to prove, and should pursue a 
comeback. Athletes usually do not 
consider public opinion as a major 
factor in their decision, but 
Lemieux understands his choice 
will have a profound effect on the 
Pittsburgh sports scene. He is just 
about the only bright spot in the

Malone irked by 
Shaqs brush-off
Utah Jazz player Karl Malone can
not understand why Shaquille ONeal 
and Kevin Garnett do not want to par
ticipate on the United States 2004 
Olympic basketball team in Athens. 
The team, which will include Tracy 
McGrady, Jason Kidd, and Tim 
Duncan, must play several qualifying 
rounds if Malone, 41, is to make 
another Olympic appearance before 
retiring.
Malone hopes that by including 
some of the NBAs biggest centers, 
they can be as dominant as the 1992

medal in Barcelona by averaging 117

Pennies from Mellon:
The Greeks duke it out for charity in their annual Penny Wars
On March 15, the Greek community will again come together for their annual Greek Sing event to 
display their talents in the performing arts. In addition to weeks of intense rehearsals leading up 
to the show, the fraternities and sororities also prepare for Greek Sing by each contributing $500 
to the Ronald McDonald foundation, the beneficiary of the yearly event.
Each chapter of the Greek community attempts to raise most of their $500 through the annual 
Penny Wars. The Penny Wars were first started by the Greek Council in 2001 when sorority sister 
Elena Balestreire was Greek Sing chair. The idea for the fundraiser came from Elizabeth Olsen 
from Kappa Alpha Theta, who organized the event. They designed Penny Wars to promote healthy 
competition between Greek chapters.
This past week, different fraternities and sororities manned a table of jars full of pennies in the 
University Center, hoping that contributions from passersby would grant them the most pennies 
and thus bring them victory in the Penny Wars. However, if bills or coins other than pennies were 
found in the jars at the end of the week, pennies equivalent to the amount of money given in the 
form of bills or silver coins would be subtracted from the amount in the jars. But this rivalry is all 
for a greater good.
All of the money goes to charity regardless of what it is, said Matt Simone, a first-year student in 
CIT and a pledge at Kappa Delta Rho.
While competition appeared to be more friendly than furious, some of Simones opponents jars 
had one too many pennies, he said with a smile. Participants watching over the penny tables kept 
their eyes on the penny levels of their opponents.
Vanessa Braganza, a senior in business policy and management and a sister at Delta Delta Delta, 
said Penny Wars bring together two very important aspects of Greek life: philanthropy and 
healthy competition.
According to Braganza, philanthropy is one of the bedrock principles that [her] sorority and 
many other Greek organizations were founded upon, while healthy competition allows every 
Greek organizations journey to excellence to be ongoing by [each chapters] striving to be the 
best.
The competition ended on Thursday afternoon. Kappa Delta Rho came in victorious in this years 
Penny Wars, having managed to successfully keep its jar clean from unwanted silver coins and 
paper bills. The fraternity raised $384.41 through the fundraiser.

CMUs Home Economics club planned to sponsor a dinner to 
end their International Week program. The simple dinner was 
intended to show students in attendance the difference 
between an average dinner eaten in some other countries and 
one eaten in the U.S. Proceeds from the dinner were to go to 
Holland Relief and the National Home Economics 
Associations International Scholarship fund.
25 YEARS AGO
After Director of Auxiliary Services Bill Dillon expressed in The 
Tartan that students were vandalizing residence halls, The 
Tartan interviewed CMUs Director of Security, Michael Corletti. 
Corletti said that calling it vandalism was inappropriate, that 
property damage was the correct term. The most common 
complaints were of discharged fire extinguishers and markings 
on walls. Other incidents included walls being kicked in, elec
trical fixtures being pulled or removed, and glass being broken.
10 YEARS AGO
A reporter from The Tartan interviewed the managers of Retail 
Services and Entropy after discovering that prices were higher at 
Entropy than Uni-Mart, which operated just down the street from 
CMU. Although Entropys manager said that they tried to pass 
along as many savings to the students as possible, of the six items 
surveyed, four were more expensive at Entropy than Uni-Mart.
5 YEARS AGO
The University Academic Calendar Committee voted to move 
spring break for the following year from the 11th to the ninth 
week of the semester. The move was an attempt to unite the 
schools three academic calendars (GSIA, Heinz, and the rest 
of the University). They felt that spring break broke up mini 
four too much, and would better serve students as a break 
between minis. Midsemester break would have been moved to 
an unspecified date. This year, spring break falls in the 11th 
week of the semester.

Fifth-year art major William Kofmehl, a.k.a. Lobster Boy, was

Then in 17th-century French Quarter New Orleans, the cake was incorporated 
into pre-Lent carnival celebrations. To this day, come carnival season, bakeries 
across the nation are flooded with requests for the delectable sweet.
The demand has really grown in the past few years as the popularity of Mardi 
Gras has grown, says Baker.
Jenny Lee, one of the few Pittsburgh shops that bakes King Cakes, has had them 
on their menu for the past seven years, but has been catering to special requests 
for much longer than that. Baker estimates that this year theyll be baking more 
than 150 King Cakes for Pittsburghers hungry for a taste of the Big Easy.
You can get your own King Cake from Jenny Lee Bakery in Market Square, or 
you can try out this traditional recipe in your own kitchen.

Technically a Danish, not a cake, this pastrys most defining characteristic is the 
small plastic baby thats baked inside. Though a seemingly bizarre custom, New 
Orleanss bakers have included the small infant toys as a reminder of the holi
days Christian origins: the baby symbolizes the Christ child, and King Cake is 
eaten at Mardi Gras to commemorate the Twelfth Night, a time of gift-giving 
and feasting. Whoever cuts the slice with the baby Jesus inside will have won
derful luck for the next year, and has the mixed blessing of having to supply next 
years King Cake.
Though Mardi Gras became an annual parade event in 1837, the first King Cake
 named in honor of the Three Kings and also known as an Epiphany Cake  
is usually attributed to 16th-century French bakers.
In France, theyd have these parties for the social elite during the week before 
Lent, explains Scott Baker, vice president of sales and marketing at Pittsburghs 
Jenny Lee Bakery.
Theyd get all their partying out of the way, so to speak, before their 40 days of 
fasting and good behavior.
King of all cakes:
The King Cake is a sweet end to a Mardi Gras meal
Its said that the people of New Orleans are always either planning a party, 
throwing a party, or recuperating from a party; this Tuesday, theyre throwing 
the biggest, most decadent party of them all. From staid religious roots, Mardi 
Gras has grown into the pinnacle of this countrys indulgence in music and mer
riment, and for a proper Fat Tuesday feast, no carnival table is complete with
out a traditional King Cake.
The sticky, sweet King Cake transcends boxed Sara Lee conceptions of pastry. 
Pregnant with a fruit, cream cheese, or cinnamon filling, and enveloped by lus
trous sugar glazes and sprinkles, the cake is as colorful as its Louisiana birth
place. Green, gold, and purple frostings crown this royal dessert, speaking for 
the faith, power, and justice that are part of its rich history.

NEW ORLEANS KING CAKE
2 packages dry active yeast 
1/2 c. sugar 
8 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
5 egg yolks 
1 c. warm milk (110F)
4 to 5 c. all-purpose flour 
2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. nutmeg
1 tsp. grated lemon zest
Vegetable oil
8 oz. cream cheese
2 1/2 c. powdered sugar 
Juice of one lemon
2 Tbsp. milk
Purple, green, and gold sugar sprinkles 
Plastic baby toy
1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Meanwhile, combine the yeast, sugar, butter, and egg yolks. 
Add the milk. With a mixer on low speed, beat the mixture for about four minutes to dissolve 
the yeast. If the yeast mixture doesn't begin to foam after a few minutes, it means its not 
active and will have to be replaced.
2. In another bowl, combine the flour, salt, nutmeg, and lemon zest. Add this mixture to the 
yeast mixture. Mix it on low speed just until it comes together, then increase the speed to 
medium and beat until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball. 
Remove the dough from the bowl and coat it lightly with vegetable oil. Return the dough to 
the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, set it in a warm, draft-free place, and let it rise until it 
doubles in size, which takes about two hours.
3. Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese and 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Mix weli. In anoth
er bowl, combine the remaining powdered sugar, lemon juice, and milk. Mix well and set 
aside.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll it into a 30"x6" rectangle. Spread the 
cream cheese filling across the center of the dough. Bring the two long edges together and 
seal all sides completely. Shape the dough into a long cylinder and place on a greased bak
ing sheet, seam side down. Shape the dough into a ring. Place a well-greased two-pound 
coffee can or shortening can in the center of the ring to maintain the shape during baking.
5. Press the plastic baby toy into the ring from the bottom so that it is completely hidden 
by the dough. Cover the ring with a towel and place in a warm, draft-free place. Let the 
dough rise for about 45 minutes, until it doubles in size. With a sharp knife, make several 
slits around the top of the ring.
6. Bake the ring at 350F for 30 minutes, or until golden brown. After baking, remove the 
coffee can immediately. Allow the cake to cool. Drizzle the cake with the sugar glaze and 
generously cover it with sprinkles. Enjoy!

Upward Spiral:
Hunt Library night watchman Eric Sisak writes them too
Hunt Library night manager Eric Sisak has never 
taken a writing class, but sometimes art imitates 
life; his piquant first full-length novel, The Book of 
Spiral, took root in his mind during his time work
ing as a staff therapist at Western Psychiatric, start
ing when he was an undergraduate psychology 
major at the University of Pittsburgh. Criminal, psy
chopathic, and hypersexed characters and situa
tions make The Book of Spiral a successor to horror 
and crime authors in the vein of Edgar Allan Poe 
and Steven King.
Sisak doesnt skimp on the violence, offering matterof-fact detail tas he alternates between narrating a 
detective sifting through remains of grisly murders 
and a psychopath hunting former pedophiles.
The book has garnered extra media attention in 
recent months because one of the characters targeted 
by the killer is an ex-priest.
Sex abuse is a theme throughout the book, Sisak 
told the Sewickley Herald Star in November. I didnt 
write the book to necessarily be contemporary, but 
when the scandals hit, they made me look contempo
rary.
Since then, hes lived the writing life, always with at 
least one job on the side.
Five years ago, Sisak moved to New York with little 
money and, he says, even less experience as a writer. 
After over a year of balancing jobs and working on 
writing his novel, he completed a manuscript  then 
scrapped it.
That was about fourteen or fifteen months I spent; 
that was about forty hours a week for about a year, a 
year and a half, that I just chalked up as practice, he 
said.
It cost me absolutely everything, he said, I really 
bottomed out. I thought I had blown it all. At one 
point, it was being considered by an agency  at one 
time, I had an agent.
Now, all this seems like it happened for the best, said 
Sisak, but at the time, it depleted him financially and 
emotionally.
Theres also the act of writing 40 to 50 hours a week, 
which can be grueling, said Sisak.
And it made me broker and broker, but by the end, I 
think I had actually learned how to do it.
With partner in crime Frank Roland, Sisak has helped
to inaugurate the publishing arm of Incredibly 
Thin, a collective of local artists bent on break
ing the independent media mold.
[Roland] is a friend of mine that I met years 
ago under the most unlikely of circumstances. 
We were both waiting tables at this lousy 
restaurant, and right away it seemed like we 
clicked. Since we met, I went to New York and I 
got to work for some people, and I brought stuff 
back and were applying it locally. It was a huge 
gamble.
Sisaks plans are to stay put for the moment and 
continue working on a new novel unconnected to 
Spiral.
Im at the point now where I like this job, said 
Sisak of his post at Hunt Library. [The novel] is 
back being considered in New York at the same 
time were doing well locally. Its the first time 
Ive been able to relax. This is the only thing I 
ever wanted to do, and now Ive done it.
Sisak will be signing copies of The Book of Spiral 
on Wednesday, March 5, from 10 am to 3 pm on 
the ground floor of the University Center. Books 
will be on sale to CMU students, faculty, and staff 
at a discounted price of $10. Coffee Tree Roasters 
will provide coffee and pastries.

Spiral, visit www.incrediblythin.com.

Killing your darlings:
Keith Banner speaks to writers about the short story
Keith Banner, author of the short story 
Is This Thing On? and the novel The Life 
I Lead, made a surprise, unplanned visit 
to one of Sharon Dilworths Survey of 
Forms: Fiction classes before heading to 
the Associative Writing Conference in 
Baltimore. The purpose of his visit was to 
give budding writers his advice on what a 
good short story entails.
The talk was very casual, set in Baker 
Hall 255, the same room where the first 
scene of Wonder Boys was filmed. Banner 
took on a very relaxed tone with his audi
ence, telling jokes and sharing comedic 
instances that he and Dilworth had 
encountered in their journey as young 
writers.
Banner started off by reading from his short story Is This Thing On?, a story 
about a how a familys dysfunction is their only means of functioning. He later 
gave tips on various strategies for writing short stories, such as numbering the 
scenes, which aids in getting rid of excess material and making dramatic 
sense within the story.
Dont be afraid to be dramatic, he said. You have to take off your writing 
hat. You cant be precious about [writing].... Its about performance. Its 
about authority. Otherwise, the reader will know youre chicken because you 
cant go through with [being dramatic].
Banner made many references to his writing influences, particularly 
Flannery OConnor. He said he admires her work because she was so bold 
and didnt hold back on details, writing about the working class, the 
lower class ... the dirty class. He said that it was these little details, the 
color of socks or the rust on the front porch swing, which could really 
make a story.
A good writer has to have a certain grain of stupidity, he quoted from 
OConnor, meaning that the writer has to pay attention to the little things.
Banner has received mixed positive and negative feedback for his novel, The 
Life I Lead. Some more conservative readers arent able to cope with the strik
ing fact that the main character, Dave, possesses pedophilic thoughts for a 
six-year-old boy named Nathan. Some readers felt that Daves emotions and 
psychology are too intense, and were perhaps an extension of the authors 
own attractions.
However, a great number of people responded to the novel with praise, say
ing that its imagery was something to remember, making the reader think 
about sensitive issues such as pedophilia in a different way.
Im not a pedophile, said Banner, but I can imagine it. Taking what you 
know and merging it with something alien makes it all the more gut-wrench
ing.

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): The luck youve recently 
experienced during games of Minesweeper and Go Fish will 
fail you on your next exam, largely because the test will not 
be multiple choice and c-d-a-b-b has nothing to do with 
Marxism or the Russian Revolution.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): The rising outdoor tempera
tures will fill you with fear, anxiety, and haunting memories 
of bullies from your childhood. Chicken Legs: some people 
just shouldn't wear shorts.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Your dream of being serenaded with beautiful mes
sages of love and adoration will finally be realized by a pock-marked young suit
or whose voice is changing, prompting you to think of 
better dreams.
*
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): A pro-war vegetarian? 
Sure, that's convincing.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): You will finally get so fed 
up with your hair that you will impulsively shave it all 
off. Unfortunately, you will discover that you also have 
a funny-shaped head.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): You will fall asleep in 
a comfy chair in the first-floor work area of Hunt Library, 
waking up briefly to half-consciously gaze at the giant 
wooden tooth sculpture by the book checkout. You will not 
remember waking up and will interpret your "tooth vision" 
as a message from the powers that be to promptly drop out 
of Carnegie Mellon and enroll in a dental program. Your 
dental hygiene will also dramatically improve.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Your date isnt standing you up. Saying I 
live at #7 in that apartment next to the religious building on 5th Avenue is just 
rather unspecific.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Simpsons fans worldwide will welcome 
you with open arms when an irreparable rift is created between you and your 
roommate after she insists Bart is not a good role model and four-fingered peo
ple who dont age are just freaky.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Being 
broke and not having a car will soon reveal its upside 
when you try to hit on a really hot socialist conserva
tionist.
CAPRICORNICAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): If only 90 
were a percent and not your score out of 18,500.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Telling the 
folks in your dorm that you import and sell "illegal plant 
life may make you sound cool now, but trading in ille
gal varieties of Dutch tulips will not sustain their fear 
and adoration for long.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Saying that your 
friend is a really liberal Republican will only mask his 
support for the president and current administration for 
so long. Soon, an intervention may be necessary.

Rising stars:
The Nick Casey Band cuts its first album in the School of Music
If youve ever stopped in at a concert at The Quiet Storm, or are a follower of the 
Yves Jean Band, then you might have heard of the Nick Casey Band. These four 
School of Drama juniors have been creating a stir in the local music scene in 
Pittsburgh, and beyond.
The band name is derived from the two songwriters names, Nick Webber and 
Casey Spindler. The pair joined forces in the second semester of their first year, 
deciding that their guitar and piano skills could produce tunes worthy of a 
band. Starting from Ben Murrays basement in Squirrel Hill, they have moved 
their practices on campus to the School of Drama.
They threw their debut CD release party last Sunday in the Wells Video Studio 
of the Purnell Center for the Arts. Previous performances included gigs at The 
Quiet Storm in Bloomfield, The Club Caf, and Nicks Fat City in the South Side. 
Their current plans include opening for Yves Jean in Nicks Fat City, and in dif
ferent locations in the Pittsburgh area.
We are riding on this [CD] for awhile. Were just going to sell it at local shows. 
Were waiting and seeing feedback from the industry, said Spindler. Were 
going to do league presentations, which are basically auditions for actors in L.A. 
Well continue touring and performing, probably in L.A.
Webber and Spindler recruited Matthew Montgomery as their percussionist. 
Montgomery is also a percussionist for the Yves Jean Band, whose members are 
veterans in the music world and have toured nationwide with bands such as 
Dave Matthews Band, Seal, and The Clarks. The Nick Casey Band hopes to start 
touring nationwide with YJB beginning with Pittsburgh, then at Los Angeles 
this summer.
The bands first release is a self-tided collection of fresh new sounds. Recorded 
in the School of Music, this project is well thought out and heartily performed. 
With the help of School of Music professor Riccardo Schultz, these Drama stu
dents whipped up an EP that spouts a medley of piano, guitar, and percussion, 
a perfect blend of not-too-hard, not-too-soft, not-too-upbeat yet not-too-mellow 
cuts. The unique balance gives a deep, contemplative sound that has no hint of 
the shallowness of pop or the roughness of rock. Their understanding of classi
cal music and contemporary rhythm shines in their individual songs. Although 
their vocals arent exacdy opera-quality, it gives a feel of real voices and danc
ing fingers truly playing their instruments. You can hear evidence of their inspi
rations, which include Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, 
and Stevie Wonder.
Their lyrics are very thoughtful. Echoes of everyday life resound within these 
simple yet profound words.
We usually get our lyrics from playwrights. Our two main influences are 
Tennessee Williams and August Wilson, said Spindler.
No wonder these deep words reflect human drama and life. Spindler, Webber, 
and Ben Murray sing these lyrics softly in harmony. Spindler is pleased with the 
bands musical growth.
O --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PILLBOX. 3 MARCH 2003.
Webber and Spindler traveled to Scodand together, where they concentrated on 
their dual career goals of becoming both accomplished actors and famous musi
cians. While acting in the play Billy the Kid, the two diligent students worked on 
their music after their sessions at the theatre ended in the evening. This shaped 
their daily routine when they returned to the States.

This is as good as we can sound now, he said.
The EP starts off with the catchy Brothers Secret, and melancholy Slow 
Dance to set the pace. In the fourth track Walk This Land, the musicians real
ly play their hearts out with individual solo stints showcasing the three instru
ments. The driven and darker third track, I Dont See the Wrong in It, stirs the 
darker emotions and shows off Spindler and Webbers great match-up as musi
cians. In Waiting for the Light, the piano is not really heard, so this song has 
more emphasis on the other instruments with soothing guitar riffs and a balladic 
tone. The piano comes back up again in their final track, Coming Undone.

staffwriter
Taking a closer look:
A showcase of the African-American Greek community
The tables of the Rangos ballroom were full last Friday as representatives from many Greek 
organizations at CMU filed in for the Taking a Closer Look step exhibition. Historically 
black Greek organizations from local chapters came together to celebrate Black History 
Month.
This event was sponsored by CMAP (Carnegie Mellon Action Project) and Student Life, and 
was intended to encourage the development of African-American Greek organizations on 
campus and to promote minority awareness.
Representatives from each visiting fraternity and sorority gave brief oral presentations about 
their historical backgrounds, accomplishments, and future outlooks. In addition, each had 
information booths to inform the minority community at CMU of their morals and purpose. 
There was also a brief question-and-answer session followed by the highlight of the night, a 
step exhibition.
CMAP, the events co-sponsor, is an organization that serves as a resource for underrepre
sented students at CMU. According to the organizations website, CMAP aids in recruiting 
African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans, and provides them with a supportive 
environment for a successful undergraduate career.
The last time this type of event was held [by CMAP] was two years ago. The students want
ed it again, said program coordinator Damian Dourado, program associate of CMAP. This 
event opened eyes to things that people dont see all the time at CMU. I am very pleased with 
the turn-out.
This event captured the interest of not just the student population, but also the alumni of 
these organizations. Many were pleasantly surprised by the large turnout, and the audience 
was pleased with the presentation.
I learned about sorority life, and I think it was a good event for CMU. Now I know there is 
an outreach program to join sororities, said Kelenne Tuitt, a sophomore biology major.
It raised the awareness about whats going on in and out of CMU. It was another opportunity to 
learn something outside of the academic community, said Russell Borum, a junior ECE major.
In addition, the event encouraged future development of African-American Greek life at 
Carnegie Mellon.
It gives us lots of hope. Im working with Dr. Gloria Hill, [director of CMAP], to start a [chap
ter of] Delta Sigma Theta, said first-year psychology major Joanna White.
A common theme of the participating organizations included service to the community and 
scholarship as well as life-long brotherhood and sisterhood. Each organization had their list 
of community services.
We do things to help the community through 14 nationally-mandated programs, said 
Damian Jackson, a senior social science major at Robert Morris College and a brother of 
Omega Upsilon Phi.
This event lets us share what were doing and is for people who are interested to hear more 
about the social and community aspects [of the organizations]. It is an important way for 
CMU students to learn about African-American culture and notable African-Americans who 
were part of the organizations, and to learn how the organization continues to support its 
community, said Daria Kirby, vice president of membership for Alpha Alpha Omega chapters 
of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.

Breakfast of Champions
Tcidfimdnv. 10:30,12:30)
I had never read any Kurt Vonnegut material, or even 
picked up any of his books  that is, until the day I 
caught my little sister (five years younger than me, no 
less!) reading Breakfast of Champions. I snatched the 
paperback away from her, enticed by the simple drawings 
that littered the books pages. I remember laughing hys
terically at Vonneguts sketched rendition of female 
underpants on page 24. Oh, how I laughed for days.
But one may not laugh so much at this cinematic adapta
tion of this classic novel. The story is centered around the 
life of a car salesman (Bruce Willis) whose life is leading 
him straight to a mental breakdown. A pill-gulping wife 
and an associate that enjoys wearing womans lingerie are 
just part of this salesmans damnation, so he tries to find 
solace with a rarely-read, unpublished science fiction 
author who comes into town on a book tour.
I have to say that, although I have not actually seen this 
movie, it may be a very big failure on everyone's part to 
watch it. Bruce Willis as a nerdy car salesman? Its like 
John Travolta playing a powerful and seductive alien in 
Battlefield Earth. What is that?

Mardi Gras at the HUB:
CMUs one-stop-shop adds partying to their list of services
Nestled in the basement of Warner Hall lies The HUB, the one-stop shop of the 
CMU campus. The HUB is home to nine enrollment service counselors who do 
so much more than just produce transcripts, pay bills, and make IDs. To show 
their gratitude to the students who take advantage of these services, the coun
selors are holding customer appreciation days on March 3 and 4.
Today from 10 am to 3 pm, students can take their student ID cards to the HUB 
to have a new one printed, whether their card is in poor condition or they just 
want a new picture. On March 4, Fat Tuesday, from 11 am to 2 pm, students can 
drop in for free cookies, donuts, and punch. On either day, students can enter a 
raffle for $50 in Campus Express funds or a free transcript, and can show their 
ID to get a string of Mardi Gras beads.
The HUBs enrollment service counselors began to hold the annual customer 
appreciation days three years ago to give students relief before midterms and 
some much-needed distraction from the dismal Pittsburgh weather of late 
February and early March, explained counselor John Carns. They also hope to 
draw students in to show them that they are more than clerks passing out 
refund checks and transcripts.
The students bring in energy and vibrancy every day, and we wanted to set 
these days aside just to say thank you, said Carns about his three years of expe
rience at the HUB and customer appreciation days.
In 1995, Carnegie Mellon combined the registrar, payments, ID creation, finan
cial aid services, and student accounts offices to form the HUB. Where other 
institutions have five separate offices, CMU has Carns, Linda Ebel, Debra Scott, 
Rosemary Lewis, Bryan Williams, Barbara Gillotti, Chris Mattis, Jill Fernandes, 
and Nicole Lechene, a graduate student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, 
who do it all in manning The HUB.
They cover phones, emails, faxes, direct contact with students at the front 
counter, and individual conferences with students about financial aid. Some 
counselors like Scott and Gillotti have been around since The HUBs inception, 
and every counselor is trained for every task to properly accommodate every 
student.
We are here to help. The HUB is a problem reservation center, and this is a way 
to celebrate the students, said Ebel, mentioned above.

The joy of Sex Week:
The Womens Center celebrates carnal awareness
g&eJcxn0w 8:00 Fyu g&r bJisdp mrnxdRP
A first-time visitor to the Womens Center might be impressed by how much 
the place resembles the cozy home of an intellectual, graying lesbian couple. 
The walls are painted a warm yellow and lined by a treasure trove of books on 
sexuality, psychology, and feminism. Theres folk art on the walls. For the 
reading, the lights were dimmed and the stereo played joyous female voices 
singing over acoustic guitars.
As a prelude to the event, organizers Emma Rehm, a professional writing senior, 
and Rebecca Deutsch, a computer science senior, passed around a big box full of 
assorted goodies: vanilla, pineapple, strawberry condoms, and lots of lube. 
Everyone there also had a chance to enter a door-prize contest with first base, sec
ond base, and third base prizes including vibrators, body paint, and sex swings.
The first brave individual to volunteer to read was Heather DiPrima, a creative 
writing freshman, whose contributions to the event included a well-inten
tioned piece about an adulterous liaison entitled Sticky Situations, and an 
earnest rendition of Touch-a-touch-a-touch-a Touch Me! from the musical 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Not many other people brought their own work to read, but some volunteered 
to read aloud from the Women Centers collection of erotic fiction. One young 
man effectively ended the event by picking up a book that wasnt extraordi
narily interesting or erotic and reading it to the audience for more than thirty 
minutes. Everyone was too polite to stop him.

The reading was marred by uncomfortable silences and weird tension. Could 
this mean that having an erotic reading was a bad idea? No, it just means that 
CMU needs many, many more erotic readings. Perhaps just one Sex Week a year 
isnt enough. Its like putting a band-aid on a spewing wound.

Alison Bodenhemier, president of the Campus Womens Organization at the 
University of Pittsburgh, presented parts of two movies that are advertised in 
stores as feminist porn or porn for women in an effort to get the word out 
that feminists arent inherently opposed to porn. She said, Some arguments 
in favor of porn are that it helps people explore sexualities that they otherwise 
wouldnt know about, and also that porn pushes back shame, it allows viewers 
to see sex beyond just its procreative purposes. Bodenhemier considers herself 
a feminist, and shes so pro-porn that shes writing up a business plan to open an 
erotic boutique in Pittsburgh.
The first show of the night, Loves Passion, centered on the fantasies of a female 
romance novel writer. In one sequence, the writer dreams herself into a Civil 
War period piece wherein her war-torn soldier returns home to get some of his 
ladys lovin. This porn looked amazingly like the cover of a drugstore bodiceripper come to life. Is this what women are supposed to want? Bodenhemier 
encouraged the audience to ask such media-analyzing questions as they 
watched. The prolonged scene where the writer-lady-as-Southern-belle 
sponges the blood and dirt off her man and the camera lingers on his scabbed,
bloody knee was decidedly unsexy.
The next movie, titled Slide Bi Me, focused on the wet and wild goings-on at an 
insurance company picnic. Since Slide Bi Me is a sex-positive film highlighting 
racial, aesthetic, and sexual diversity, it features a scene where all the insurance 
employees (white, black, male, female, fat, skinny) tumble around on a slipnslide and grab indiscriminately at each others genitals. Somehow, the shot where 
one guy sprays water from the lawn hose up another guys bum just really lacked 
erotic interest. A pornography viewer of any ethnicity or gender could imagine 
himself or herself being respectfully welcomed and played with at the Slide Bi Me 
company picnic  but why would anyone want to imagine such a thing?
Bodenhemier opened up a heated discussion among the audience about what it 
means for pornography to be feminist or for women. Some of the questions 
batted around were: Is feminist pornography whatever turns a woman on and 
gets her off? Or does it require some kind of ideology at work in the movie? Is 
porn for women if it has romance, or if it shows womens pleasure being put 
first? For those interested in watching more feminist and sex-positive porn, 
Bodenhemier suggested the following websites: goodvibes.com, onourbacksmag.com, suicidegirls.com, and nerve.com.

Salsa para siempre:
SALSA gives steps for dancing the night away
You all catch on fast, said Colleen after showing 
a cross-body lead turn. Lets learn some more.
Colleen and Jeff then partnered everyone and had 
them form a circle, instructing them in combina
tions of moves and having the females rotate 
around so that they would be able to dance to dif
ferent methods of leading. Not surprisingly, many 
of the men there were new to Latin Salsa dancing, 
while others had experience but with different 
styles.
After the dance instructions, the real party started 
as couples took the floor to show off their new 
dance moves. The level of experience was appar
ent as certain couples, especially Colleen and Jeff, 
spun, slid, sashayed, and one-two-three, five-sixseven-ed across the floor. They have been dancing 
together for about fifteen years and had met in a 
disco club. They each teach Latin dancing and 
together started Salsa, Pittsburghs Saturday Night 
Social Dance series, which is held every second 
Saturday of the month through June 14. This 
Saturday, March 8, will be the first of the series 
and will be held at the Bulgarian Macedonian 
Cultural Center in West Homestead, where free 
Salsa lessons will be given for an hour.
Dancing is our way of communicating with each 
other. When youve danced with a person for so 
long, you get to know each others idiosyncrasies, 
said Jeff while he and his wife were 
taking a break from dancing across 
Rangos Ballroom.
SALSA has more events for the semes
ter planned as they strive to get the 
CMU community involved with Latin' 
culture. On March 18, Garcia said 
SALSA will be showing Abre los Ojos in 
Baker Hall as part of their film festival. 
Soon to come will also be Cooking in 
the Dorms and free food during final 
exams. In mid-April, they will be hold
ing a soccer tournament and barbeque 
for all who would like to join in the fes
tivities. Their next dance event will be 
held at the dance club Cozumel in 
Shadyside and is open to people eight
een and older, since many undergrad
uates are usually left out of dance 
clubs because they cant get in, said 
Garcia.

If everyone reaches way down inside themselves, 
wiggles their hips a little bit, and looks seductively 
across the room at the hot topic theyve had their 
eye on since their entry, it is possible that they will 
discover some Spanish rhythm in their bones. 
However, if some are afraid to make that journey, 
SALSA has some moves that will shake them out of 
their apprehensiveness.
This past Saturday, SALSA, the Spanish and Latin 
Students Association, held its Masquerade Ball in 
Carnegie Mellons Rangos Ballroom. The organiza
tion went the distance to meet the social needs, as 
well as the hunger, of its guests as they brought 
dance instructors Jeff and Colleen Shirey and food 
from La Fiesta, a restaurant in Oakland.
I just wish more people had shown up, said 
Karina Garcia, junior international relations and 
anthropology double major and president of 
SALSA.
The event started at 8 pm and the music, full of 
Latin rhythm and flare, was provided by DJ Carlton 
of Club Havana. The crowd was sparse and surpris
ingly mostly female despite the male dominance 
usually seen at CMU events.
The DJ opened up with a freestyle 
dance, but everyone decided to take the 
time to fill their stomachs with cheese, 
chicken, or vegetarian quesadillas, 
flautas, and Spanish rice.
Around 8:30 pm, DJ Carlton made the 
announcement that the dance instruc
tions would commence. Colleen, decked 
out in black pants, red baby tee, and red 
waist sash, along with her husband Jeff, 
dressed in loose black pants and airy 
white button-down shirt, split the room 
up with males on one side and females 
on the other and went through the basic 
steps of the leader and the follower in 
L.A. Nightclub-style Salsa, which con
sisted of tighter turns and back-andforth steps as opposed to side-to-side 
movements. Colleen put random girls on 
the spot to show them how each dance 
position would feel with a partner.
Where are the men? asked graduate student of 
engineering and public policy Claire Palmgren, as 
she sat with her friend and fellow grad student of 
engineering and public policy Elaine 
Newton as they waited for their other
associates to arrive.

Shaky start:
Thornton Wilders classic Skin of Our Teeth is an uneven production
dropped in favor of much philosophizing about 
hope and the future of the human race.
In the end, the strong female performances can
not save the play from its own awkwardness and 
lack of continuity. The jarring changes in loca
tion make for a confusing and uneven work, and 
its final sentimental tone cannot help but seem 
contrived. It has often been shown that bad act
ing can spoil a good play, but The Skin of Our 
Teeth proves just the opposite, that a poor play 
can spoil good acting.
LJrRxn mr0rcw hsnaaCJdsrJ

Despite the recent set collapse that injured five 
actors in the School of Dramas latest production, 
The Skin of Our Teeth, the play enjoyed a timely 
premiere on Thursday evening at the Chosky 
Theater. The damaged set was repaired, and 
except for the fact that two of the actresses 
moved about on crutches and wheelchairs during 
the show, no other signs of the accident 
remained.
Thornton Wilders The Skin of Our Teeth begins 
with a newscast introducing the Antrobus family 
and highlighting the achievements of father 
George Antrobus, inventor of, among other 
things, the alphabet and the number system. The 
play focuses on the daily struggles of this unusu
al family, including Mr. and Mrs. Antrobuss mar
ital spats, their daughter Gladyss emerging sexu
ality, son Henrys (a.k.a. Cain) penchant for ston
ing others, and the maid Sabinas repeated 
attempts to seduce Mr. Antrobus:
With each act, the play shifts to an entirely new 
time period and location. While Act I begins in 
the Antrobus home during the Ice Age, Act II 
takes us to Atlantic City, New Jersey, just before 
the biblical Deluge. Act III returns to the family 
home after the war. Such changes require 
appropriate scenery, and this play is no excep
tion. The scenery was elaborate and detailed 
without overshadowing the actors. The Atlantic 
City set, complete with boardwalk, casinos, and 
an elaborate fortune telling booth, was especial
ly noteworthy.
The acting, like the play itself, is uneven. The 
male actors are rather histrionic, delivering their 
lines with an excessive drama that is unable to 
stir up audience sympathy or interest. Not so with 
the female actors, especially Jaclyn Fjestad, who 
plays Mrs. Antrobus, and Natalie Field, who plays 
Sabina. Fjestad, with her white gloves, perfectly 
coiffed hair, and first-lady costume, does a won
derful job of playing the unsatisfied, domineer
ing housewife. Field delivers her lines with a 
remarkable passion, and she can wheel around 
more gracefully in a wheelchair than many peo
ple can walk.
As the play progresses, the plot 
becomes more erratic and nonsen
sical. In sharp contrast to the light
heartedness of the first two acts, 
Act III seems to belong in an entire
ly different play: a post-war drama 
about human struggles and new 
beginnings. Though the other two 
acts were set earlier in history, the 
final act takes place after World 
War II. It depicts the shattered 
Antrobuses as war survivors, hero
ically striving to rebuild their fami
ly after the madness. Characters 
like Henry that were formerly one
dimensional and comedic are sud
denly fleshed out and given deep 
emotional conflicts. The plays dia
logue turns darker, and its biblical 
references and initial silliness are

Blue jackets with official patches combined with 
walkie-talkies may bring to mind the Campus Police, 
but a five-foot, three-inch tall first-year woman sport
ing a patch and a walkie-talkie is not so common a 
sight. This is why some students on duty for the 
Carnegie Mellon University Emergency Medical 
Services (CMU EMS) tend to turn a few heads when 
seen walking around campus in full uniform.
While these volunteers rightfully inspire admiration, 
they are members of an organization of which anyone 
interested can become a part. About 28 people are 
currendy involved in CMU EMS, a kind of on-campus 
9-1-1 for medical emergencies. Each active member is 
on duty for at least two 24-hour shifts each month, 
although people who enjoy it end up taking about 
one shift a week, said Bryan Kaplan, a senior busi
ness major and the Operations Manager of CMU EMS.
-14----------------
Training for CMU EMS begins with three days of 
intense instruction, held at the beginning of each 
semester. During the first two days, trained instruc
tors teach lessons in first aid and CPR, as well as in 
some of the organizations specific policies and pro
cedures. The following Saturday, new members 
learn to use some of the equipment and participate 
in sample calls which give them a chance to voice 
any lingering questions and concerns.
To become a certified Emergency Medical 
Technician (EMT-B) in the Commonwealth of the 
Pennsylvania, an individual must obtain 140 train
ing hours through classes and practical training ses
sions. In PA, there are two types of EMTs, basic (-B) 
and paramedic (-P). Most of the EMTs on-campus 
are EMT-Bs. Those that are EMT-Ps must complete 
120 hours of both class and clinical time to qualify
PILLBOX. 3 MARCH 2003. v
to administer drugs and start intravenous lines.
To stay an active duty member of CMU EMS, a vol
unteer must give 48 hours of service per month, 
unless they fall under special circumstances (i.e. 
personal emergencies or those who are enrolled in 
EMT classes, whose required hours are waived). In 
addition to training those who want to become 
members of CMU EMS, the training division of CMU 
EMS offers classes to any organization including the 
CMU Police Department and the Engineering and 
Public Policy Department to earn certification in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid.
[CMU EMS] is one of the stricter [sic] collegiate 
EMS training programs in the country, said Kaplan.
There exist four levels of membership in CMU EMS,

a precepting member being the first one. A participant who has reached the sec
ond level is called a medical member. They are allowed to go on scene alone for 
the first few minutes of the call. They have also been a member of CMU EMS for 
a few months and have taken at least 12 emergency calls. A crew chief, a volun
teer at the third level of membership, has the highest medical qualification in 
the organization. Crew chiefs are all registered Pennsylvania EMTs and have 
passed the crew chief training program. Crew chiefs are able to run calls on 
campus by themselves. The fourth and highest rank in CMU EMS is a supervi
sor. Because of hands-on experience and patient interaction, EMS is good for 
people who want to go to medical school, but it is also good for people who just 
want to do something nice for the community, said Kaplan.
So how did a business major like Kaplan become so involved with CMU EMS 
that he rose to one of the highest positions of leadership in the organization? 
According to Kaplan, he was once at a family party having a conversation with 
someone and turned around to get a glass of water. When he turned back 
around, he noticed that the person he had been talking to had collapsed to the 
floor. There was no doctor present and even though Kaplan had received train
ing in CPR and first aid in high school, he did not have first-hand experience and 
had, like most of us, forgotten these skills.
I never wanted to be in that situation again, Kaplan explained. After making a 
decision to certify his first-aid and CPR skills, he became familiar with CMU 
EMS, decided to try a few calls, and fell in love with the organization. He has 
been a member of CMU EMS since the spring of his first year.
CMU EMS receives approximately 500 emergency calls from students on cam
pus each year. It belongs to the National Collegiate EMS Foundation and is cel
ebrating its 20th anniversary as an organization in 2004. CMU EMS averages 
slightly over one call per day, receiving cails related to anything from ankle 
injuries to cardiac arrests, said Kaplan.
There are a total of five automated external defibulators (AEDs) on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus and one at the Robotics Engineering Consortium in 
Lawrenceville. They allow people not trained as paramedics to handle cardiac 
arrest situations and deliver live saving care to a patient. AEDs deliver an elec
trical shock to the heart using computer technology. CMU EMS had an AED save 
two years ago when Kaplan himself was the crew chief on duty.
You have the pads that you place on the persons chest and you know that 
when you have to use these, the person is dead, said Kaplan. And being able
Gena Miller, Nick McCullar, and Carl Peterson (background) are trained in CPR.
to give them back life through these pads is very rewarding.
Some might think that every day an EMT spends on duty is filled with excite
ment and action. However, Chris Costa, junior engineering and public policy 
and electrical and computer engineering double major and Executive Director 
of CMU EMS, said a typical day as a member of CMU EMS is like any other day, 
a normal routine except for that one time youre on call.
A call, from the time its dispatched to the on-duty crew in that area to the 
timethe crew reports back to the EMS office and files a trip sheet (which basi
cally tells the who, what, when, and where of the call) with the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, usually takes about an hour.
Since CMU EMS members are required to be on call for 24 hours twice a 
month, a member subjects his or herself to the possibility of being called dur
ing class time. First-year computer science major Robert Lee said that on one 
occasion he was called, but has not felt that being in CMU EMS has been dis
ruptive to him academically. Costa said that a member is never required to be
Volunteers Carl Peterson and Gena Miller at training.

on call during their class time, but if the person 
chooses to be on call then, theyre encouraged to 
clear it with their professor first.
[Becoming an EMT] had never been something 
that Id thought of extensively, said Lee. 
However, you get a certain smile effect after 
coming from a call because you feel that youve 
done a service for the community.
CMU EMS is in service all through the regular 
school year, portions of breaks, and for a part of 
the summer as well.
?We try to cover as much as possible during the 
summer,? Kaplan said.
They also provide medical support for the 
Carnegie Mellon hockey team, stand by for events 
such as the spring carnival, and help the police 
direct City of Pittsburgh EMS to on-campus loca
tions. According to Kaplan, dialing 9-1-1 is often 
not the fastest way to get an ambulance to the 
CMU campus. Since CMU EMS knows the campus 
and is in close proximity, they get to a scene on 
campus in two or three minutes and to a scene off 
campus in about four. At any given time, CMU 
EMS can have up to five people on a shift.
For senior members such as Kaplan, CMU EMS 
has an advisor program for members who stay in 
Pittsburgh. Thus, graduating members of the 
organization can become advisors who will coor
dinate long-term planning and give guidance to 
newer members of CMU EMS, making sure that 
possible old mistakes will not be repeated in the 
future.
Elections for these offices will be held in April.

Riddlin this, Riddlin that:
The pop-punk Riddlin Kids deliver an uninspired new album
-----------------------------------17PILLBOX. 3 MARCH 2003. u
Despite having three stellar tracks, the Riddlin Kids debut album, Hurry Up 
and Wait, is, on the whole, disappointing, repetitive, and quickly forget
table.
During the albums finer moments, tracks like the Blink 182-esque I Feel Fine 
feature simple yet effective guitar riffs between guitarists Dustin Stroud and 
Clint Baker, musicians tailor-made for TRL and FM radio.
The most moving and timeless track on Hurry Up and Wait is the surprisingly 
danceable Here We Go Again, which features the chorus, Her face cramps 
and she makes a frown, then she makes a whiney sound/And I know you didnt 
get your way, and now I guess you want to fight all day/ I better watch what I 
say cause here we go again, a guys perspective on constant in-fighting 
between a couple.
Nowhere To Run gels as straightforward punk-rock that cuts out the unnec
essary sugary pop treatment, with either Baker or Stroud singing Seems like 
everything is slowly fading far away/And now it seems like everything we had 
once has gone wrong.
Sadly, the rest of the album doesnt click as well.
Of 15 tracks, 12 are about women and relationships. When done well, lyrics like 
these can be read as heartfelt poetry for the ages  but that, of course, is easi
er said than done.
Many of the tracks on Hurry Up and Wait sound similar, and have lyrics with
unimaginative recycled choruses, like in Cant Think (1,2,3,4/ I cant think 
for myself/ Cause every time I do I think of you). Compare this chorus with 
the one from I Feel Fine: Dont ever call cause I dont want to be friends/ 
Excuse me now because the chorus is coming up again/ 1,2,3,4 Looks like Im 
alone again.
The Riddlin Kids sound is -reminiscent of New Found Glory, Blink 182, and 
Sum-41. Musically, the band is in desperate need of originality; with an ocean 
of emo clones out there, sounding like your influences might not be a good 
idea. Their chances for survival would improve if their music had more inno
vative, original ideas, instead of recycling pop-punk cliched riffs and 
breaks.
This lack of originality in Hurry Up and Wait is apparent in their cover of 
REMs Its the End of the World as We Know It. The best covers are inspired 
and creative, but  above all else  in a different world than the original. 
But the Riddlin Kids cover is done in the same style and at the same speed as 
the original REM song. The only difference is added distortion on guitars, 
confirming that just because a band can cover a song doesnt mean that they 
should.
The Kids, who came out of Austin, TX, are a young band and have potential, but 
even though their debut has its brief shining moments, Hurry Up and Wait is 
not consistent. If the Riddlin Kids work on their weaknesses  lyrics, original
ity, songwriting  and improve on their strengths  great singing, energy  
the band can only go up.
The Riddlin Kids will perform live at Club Laga on Sunday, March 9 to promote 
their debut CD, Hurry Up and Wait, with fellow pop-punkers Wakefield.

Idles Isles:
Eric Idle brings his characteristic poor taste back to musical comedy in The Rutland isles
Eric Idle returns to musi
cal comedy on Tuesday 
with the release of his 
new album The Rutland 
Isles. Written and com
posed by Idle and John 
Du Prez and split into two 
sections, Isles documents 
two parts of a 168-part 
trip to fictional islands 
created when Norway 
rammed Costa Rica.
Idle earned his spurs in 
musical comedy by writ
ing songs for the 
renowned Monty Python 
comedy troupe. After the 
end of Monty Pythons 
Flying Circus (1969-74), 
he started a parodical 
band, The Rudes, whose 
work paralleled that of 
the Beades in such tele
vision specials as All You 
Need is Cash (1978). 
Though he succeeds in 
this new work, bringing
current issues into the context of his mockumentary, his songs rely heavily on 
poor taste for any humorous value. Their lyrical worth is minimized by Idle lay
ing the stupid humor on thick, but those who appreciate his previous work will 
enjoy this venture as well.
As Nigel Spasm, self-proclaimed documenter and one in a long line of British 
men in shorts, Idle recounts trips to the Island of Paranoia and the Over 
Friendly Isles.
Courtesy of www.rutlandisles.com
The first part highlights the faction of society who never quite trusts those 
behind them. The beginning of this part strays from that theme, though, 
instead using neighboring islands to jab at contraceptive behavior and obses
sive religious zeal. Throughout the middle of the trip, he returns to the theme 
of paranoia by including songs about their behaviors. The Paranoid national 
anthem, Were Much Better Than You Are, is sung by natives, and Spasm con
tinues his contribution before crash-landing on the island with a ballad about 
their national holiday: Muggers Day.
An awkward change follows this pair of songs as he continues for no apparent 
reason to the subject of questionable animal sexuality. Songs like Flipper 
Minnelli played in a lounge style and Gay Animal Song do not fit the theme 
of the album.
Laced in between these two pieces he has put a clever interim announcement: 
We apologize to listeners of the beta version of this CD that they cannot see 
this joke, which is hilarious visually. We hope soon to produce a more expensive 
version... This addition is reminiscent of the Intermission Idle et al. inserted 
randomly into Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).
Poor taste  the only type of humor featured on this album  continues into 
part two, a visit to the Over Friendly Isles, where everyone gets some benefits. 
Single entendres abound here, and such entries as Muff Diving and the oldstyle Banana Song illustrate Idles fascination with anatomy more thoroughly 
than any work since The Penis Song sung in the 1983 film The Meaning of Life. 
Spasms reception is, as the name states, overly friendly: he concludes the piece 
by describing two horny groups of natives, the Randis and the Surfing Apes.
Though he creatively keeps the topic progressing, by the end of the second part 
one has tired of the sexual humor, with the obvious exception of wondering on 
which of the islands, Paranoia or Over Friendly, one should really look out 
behind oneself.

Big Als Metal Shop:
Strapping Young Lad is back with a vengeance
Chaotic, frightening, frenzied, at times machine-like in its precision, and 
unbending in its assault on the senses. These words describe the work of 
a man possessed  youd probably think twice before debating that.
The force behind the music of the new album Strapping Young Lad, how
ever, lies in the mind of one slender, straggly-haired, wire-glass-wearing 
Vancouverite named Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad.
What surprises me most about this album is that it ever came out at all. 
For the past few years, Townsend has released album after album of 
peaceful  even poppy  music, like Terria and Ocean Machine, albums 
that soar and soothe. It had seemed like Townsend had worked out all of 
his anger and aggression, but September 11 changed all of that. The self
titled Strapping Young Lad basically sounds like Excedrin headache num
ber nine.
The result of this resurgence of his anger is explicitly seen in the blackmetal-influenced Devour or Last Minute, the thrash-death-like 
stylings of Consequence, or the tenderly bleak Bring On The Young, 
which closes the album. There isn't even another band that I could rec
ommend you check out to get some insight into what Strapping Young 
Lad sounds like. Basically, imagine an army of thousands of pissed off, 
slighdy off-center berserkers marching past your brain, in one ear and 
then out the other about forty minutes later.
Musically, the band is so tight you wont even notice how seamlessly they 
segue from one sub-genre of metal to another. The fact that they can pull 
off this melting pot of so many influences is impressive, and lends a lot to 
the war effort against your hold on what music should sound like.

Most curators would spend sleepless nights worry
ing about the outcome of an installation exhibit 
that so ambitiously throws together artists from a 
wide array of disciplines, that depends on the 
unexpectedness of the resulting pieces. It is this 
element of chance, however, that Mattress Factory 
curator Michael Olijnyk and museum co-curator 
and independent critic Graham Shearing want. Its 
what makes Gestures, an exhibition of small sitespecific works that opened at the Mattress Factory 
last Sunday, successful.
Now in its fourth round, Gestures aims to bring 
together non-traditional artists of different 
media, whose work you would not normally find 
in an installation museum. The exhibit features 
the work of local artists, including a photogra
pher, ceramicist, shopkeeper, glass artist, and 
cartoonist.
It isnt often a designer gets asked to do an 
exhibit in an art museum, said Dan Boyarski, 
head of Carnegie Mellons School of Design, 
whose work is featured in the exhibit. Boyarski, 
who teaches courses in typography, information 
design, and human-computer interaction, was 
pleasantly surprised at the invitation to be a part 
of Gestures.
Boyarskis exhibit involves a series of intensely col
ored photographs layered on top of one another. 
Cutouts in the top layers reveal sections of the bot
tom layers. The pictures themselves are various 
extreme close-ups with subjects drawn from 
nature, like stones and flowers.
If theres a theme to the piece, its the juxtaposi
tion of color and texture, said Boyarski.
Like the other artists in Gestures, Boyarski wel
comed the unexpected opportunity to explore his 
artistic interests in a different realm.
Site-specific installations can be very loosely 
translated, he said. His piece includes the series of 
fourteen photographs in a long strip along the 
wall. Past exhibits have included a video installa
tion, various furniture installations, and even a 
poetic vignette.
Photographer Pamela Bryan, museum director 
Judith H. OToole, and designer Paul Schifino are 
among the other ten artists in the exhibit. Gestures 
runs at the Mattress Factory in the North Side 
through April 6.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
.a
Ducks are creatures well-known for their ability to transform. In the 
past, they were simple animals that lived in ponds and ate breadcrumbs.
But around the year 2134, radioactive bread caused ducks to begin 
mutating, allowing them to freely change shape. Eventually, they stabi
lized, and they became the ducks we know today, able to transform at 
will from Standard Pond Mode to the more battle-worthy Ultra Mega Supa Combat Warrior 
form we are all so familiar with. Needless to say, the UMSCW troops proved to be invalu
able in our fight against the invaders from Galacticon 12. Of course, I don't need to remind 
you how that turned out. Remember this. It will be on the test.

Lights, Panels, Action:
Comic book saturation in Hollywood
At this moment, comic book-inspired movies are enjoying great success. Comic 
books and film have shared a long relationship of profitable projects. But 
overzealous production schedules may dash the recent increase in public 
demand for superhero media.
Comic books and motion pictures are relatively young forms of creative media. 
Film emerged as a popular form of entertainment at the turn of the 20th centu
ry. Comic books were first published in the 1930s, gaining mass popularity with 
the debut of Superman in 1938. But the marriage of these two media did not take 
long. In 1943, Batman film serials (short features which were released in install
ments, much like comic books) circulated the United States. As the 1950s 
dawned, characters crossed freely between film and comics.
By the early 1960s, television 
was in the majority of American 
homes. The success of ABCs 
Batman television series in 1966 
paved the way for the hugely 
popular superhero shows of the 
70s. Wonder Woman and The 
Incredible Hulk proved that 
comic book heroes could cash in 
big with the help of the 
Hollywood touch.
It should come as no surprise 
that the first modern superhero 
success at the box office was 
Warner Brothers Superman in 
1978. The original comic book 
superhero translated to the sil
ver screen with ease, grossing 
$300 million worldwide.
But the 1980s proved to be a 
fairly fruitless decade for the 
union of comic heroes and film.
It wasnt until 1989s Batman, 
inspired by the groundbreaking 
graphic novel The Dark Knight 
Returns, that superheroes were 
once again established as mass 
media money makers.
The 1990s saw many Batman imitators and spin-offs. Ventures such as the Flash 
television series and Punisher motion picture were doomed from the start due to 
poor production values. Lacking proper technology, special effects rarely trans
lated superheroes well to the moving image.
Fox Pictures took a chance on the bankrupt Marvel Comics in 2000. Despite a lim
ited budget and an ensemble cast led by Australian thespian Hugh Jackman (who 
was yet unknown to American audiences), X-Men was the summers runaway hit.
A revived interest in superheroes was marked by critical praise from various 
media. Michael Chabons novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, 
about two young comic book creators, won the Pulitzer Prize for 2000. In 
November of the same year, Academy Award-nominated director M. Night 
Shyamalan released the critically acclaimed Unbreakable. X-Men: Evolution was
the top animated childrens television series for the year 2001.
Audiences were well primed for the May 2002 release of Spider-Man. The block
buster film set the record for opening weekend ticket sales, as well as creating an 
international marketing blitz. The collaboration of comic books and motion pic
tures had never seen such success.
Currently, Daredevil sits on top of the American box office. Comic book and 
movie corporations eagerly waited to see if Marvel Comics second-tier hero 
would score with audiences. Thanks to his success, many more superhero fea
tures have been given the green light for production.
Multiple comic book-inspired films are slated for release in 2003. X-Men 2, The
Hulk, The League of Extraordinary 
Gentlemen, and Bulletproof Monk 
are only a few examples of what is 
planned for audiences this year.
In 2004, the film industry plans to 
simply smother the public with 
more superheroes than ever 
before. Marvel Comics Avi Arad 
told the Chicago Sun Times that 
The Amazing Spider-Man, The 
Punisher, Namor: The SubMariner, and either The Fantastic 
Four or Ghost Rider are all on 
schedule to be released.
Other Marvel Comics movie pro
ductions include Blade III and the 
recently announced Daredevil 
spinoff, Elektra. Dark Horse 
comics plans to venture into 
movie making with Mike 
Mignolas badass paranormal 
investigator, Hellboy.
AOL Time Warner, who owns 
Warner Brothers films, the WB 
television network, and DC 
Comics, has been busy as well. 
Two of televisions hottest acts are Smallville, a drama series detailing the 
teenage years of Superman, and Birds of Prey, an action show about three 
Batman-related characters.
Aside from successful television, AOL Time Warner has been planning film proj
ects based around popular superheroes. First up is a new Superman film for 
2004. Another Batman sequel and a Catwoman film have been in production for 
several years.
This intimidating prospectus may simply leave fans inundated with too much 
superhero media. Instead of graciously feeding demand, comic book and film 
companies may find that they have killed the desire for more superhero movies.
