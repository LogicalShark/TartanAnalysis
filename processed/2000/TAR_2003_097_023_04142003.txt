Constant in 
fair condition 
after car crash
by Christopher Chung
Contributing Editor
Three days after his car collided 
head-on with a school van on the 
Liberty Bridge last Thursday after
noon, former Carnegie Mellon histo
ry professor Edward Constant 
remains in fair condition at Mercy 
Hospital.
Constant, who was released from 
prison on bail in February and has 
been awaiting his May 27 trial for 
charges including attempted mur
der, may now face additional 
charges, and the District Attorneys 
office said it is considering request
ing that his bond be revoked.
Constant was apparently attempt
ing to pass traffic when he switched 
into the oncoming traffic lane at 
around 12:45 pm last Thursday. He 
collided head-on with an outbound 
van operated by the Western 
Pennsylvania School for the Blind, 
injuring himself and two children in 
the bus.
Emergency responders had to cut 
Constant out of his crushed Mazda 
Miatta, and traffic to and from the 
bridge came to a standstill for 45 
minutes while the accident was 
cleared.
According to the Post-Gazette, Paul 
Boas, Constants lawyer, said that 
Constant suffered a broken back, 
broken wrist, and a concussion. The 
two children were treated and 
released, and they returned to 
school the next day.
Local media has closely reported 
the accident, which was the latest 
bump in a long road that some 
Carnegie Mellon students and facul
ty have seen as the tragic downfall of 
a gifted academic and kind-hearted 
professor.
Constant was arrested and held 
last May after shooting at two police 
officers responding to a domestic 
dispute at his Mt. Lebanon home, 
and was repeatedly denied bail over 
the next eight months.
But Constants lawyer said that 
care should be taken to avoid associ
ating Thursdays accident with any 
criminal activity, such as substance 
abuse.
He was stone sober, Boas said, 
according to KDKA.
He was tested in the morning. He 
was tested in the afternoon. Theres 
nothing wrong with what he did 
other than that he was involved in a 
car accident; and all this hoopla 
about the Mt. Lebanon professor is 
doing this and doing that is really a 
shame, he said.
An article in the Tribune-Review 
said that the police will also look at 
hospital-administered blood tests, 
which will take several weeks to 
determine definitively whether or 
not Constant was under the influ
ence of any substances.
Boas said his client was entering 
downtown Pittsburgh via the Liberty 
Bridge and that the two were to dis
cuss Constants upcoming trial.
In fact, I was sitting here waiting, 
wondering why he was late, and he

Three candidates and their run
ning mates addressed approximately 
32 students last Tuesday night at the 
Student Body Presidential Debate, 
held in the Connan Room of the 
University Center (UC). Present at 
the debate were Dan Gilman for pres
ident with running mate Gilbert 
Dussek, Michael Moiseyev with Dave 
Romberger, and Quinten Steenhuis 
with Kirstin Connors. Two other can
didates, H&SS first-year Ben Hackett 
with Colin Holloway, a junior social 
and decision sciences/history double 
major, and William Guzy, a junior 
philosophy major, were absent from 
the debate.
Gilman and Dussek, juniors in phi
losophy and electrical and computer 
engineering respectively, sat straight 
backed in their seats as they focused 
on their overarching campaign of
Proven Results - Positive Action for 
the Future. The pair focused on their 
past accomplishments in dining, 
security, and UC renovations while 
emphasizing their experience and 
existing connections.
They held composure amid jests 
made by Moiseyev, a senior math 
major, and crass jokes that elicited 
shocked laughter from the audience 
and even other candidates.
Dressed in all black with a bright 
blue tie that matched the highlights 
in his hair, Moiseyev covered all 
grounds with his Power and Greed 
slogan while his running mate, 
Romberger, a senior music major, 
casually sipped beer out of a bottle 
wrapped in a white paper bag. They 
presented a balanced mixture of seri
ousness and humor.
Steenhuis, a junior philosophy 
major, was seated calmly, fielding 
questions politely alongside Connors, 
an electrical and computer engineer
ing graduate student.
Together, they championed better 
relations between students, faculty, 
staff, and administration.
Guzy, who was not at the debate, 
decided to run for president when he 
came back to CMU after a two-year 
leave from school.
Coming back after seeing the real 
world and how it functions, it made 
me realize that college is sometimes 
an incubator that shields you. I want 
to bring transformation, he said.
At the debate, perennial issues like 
dining services and the joint funding 
committee process were addressed 
by all candidates extensively, though 
each favored issues central to his 
experience and beliefs.
Gilman, currently student body 
vice president, described the cooper
ative efforts of the current student 
government with the Student 
Dormitory Council as more AYCTE 
Schatz dinners, the new salad bar in 
the UC, and affordable meal plans.
We have only taken baby steps
this past year and we plan on build
ing on what we have done with din
ing so far, said Gilman, I want to be 
able to order a bagel thats on the 
menu as late as 9:00 pm and get it on 
time.
Gilman and Dussek plan on adding 
more options for those with specific 
dietary needs as well as prolonging 
and bettering service.
Moiseyev was not as congratulato
ry about dinings progress this year.
A bunch of changes were made 
this past year, but dining still sucks. I 
think dining has to not be done by 
Parkhurst; it needs to be centralized 
and done by the University. I think 
they could throw it to the students, 
said Moiseyev. He proposed lowering 
prices and phasing Parkhurst out 
from dining.
Steenhuis agreed with Moiseyev in 
some respects.
It was a big mistake that most dinSee DEBATE, page A4

Despite Fridays foul weather, this 
years Spring Carnival saw record 
crowds and higher campus involve
ment than had been seen at those of 
the Carnival Committees recent 
memory.
Carnival Committee Chair Rebecca 
Miller, a junior ECE major, was very 
pleased with the representative num
bers of 2003s Carnival, citing 
increased attendance from students, 
faculty, and locals.
Carnegie Mellon students are 
coming out more and more. Its 
becoming much more of a big deal... 
as we get bigger bands and the 
booths get more intricate, said 
Miller.
She added that this year also saw 
significantly more of the smaller 
Blitz booths from campus organiza
tions who couldnt afford the typical, 
more flashy booths built by the 
Greeks and other large campus 
groups.
Were also seeing an increase in 
faculty and staff who are bringing 
their families, and were seeing an 
increase in the number of [people 
from] the surrounding communities 
who are bringing their families, said 
Miller.
The strong showing at Carnival of 
local high school students and fami
lies represents its own emerging
trend for the annual event.
 [Carnival]s evolved quite a bit to 
be more of a family atmosphere as 
opposed to a college atmosphere, 
said Miller.
Entertainment Co-Chair Adam 
Muffin Kramer, a senior MS/Logic 
and Computation major, agreed with 
the sentiment.
Carnival... has been a Pittsburgh 
thing. Pittsburghers ... come to CMU 
for Carnival. They enjoy what we put 
on for them, Kramer said. This 
recent family atmosphere manifested 
itself in many aspects of the planning 
for the 2003 Spring Carnival.
They were a lot more liberal with 
the slogans than we have been 
recently, said Miller, referring to 
previous Carnivals.
Concerning the entertainment 
provided for the Carnival crowds,
Kramer explained that the new 
focus on the families in attendance 
has brought increased attention to 
family-oriented activities like the 
face painting and juggling that could 
be found Saturday afternoon on 
Midway.
The additional planning of family 
activities, however, has not detracted 
from the Carnival committees ability 
to provide for the students.
The Carnival-sponsored They 
Might Be Giants concert and the 
Activity Boards much-hyped Jurassic 
5 show were both well-received by 
attendees. They Might Be Giants last 
headlined at Carnival in April of 
1992, and drew such crowds to 
Rangos on November 7, 1997 that a 
new occupancy policy was adopted

Pie-faced Jared Cohon treated Tartan contributing editor Brad Grantz, a senior business major, to his just desserts after 
Grantz pied Cohon in the commentators booth durng Sweepstakes last Saturday morning.
As the budget appeals process 
stretches onward, 93 of the 105 stu
dent organizations eligible for fund
ing have gotten a final, satisfactory 
answer from the Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) about the contents 
of their budgets for school year 
2003-2004.
Smaller organizations appeals 
have resulted in concessions, even 
including capital purchases, but 
larger organizations may still face 
unprecedented budget cuts.
Many of the demands of the 
remaining twelve organizations have 
been appeased with extra funding 
borrowed from the UC Capital 
Equipment Fund, says JFC Chair 
Alison McKenna, a senior economics 
major.
Its not money from the [UC 
Capital Equipment] fund itself, but 
from what wed normally give to the 
fund, said McKenna.
The fund is supposed to be aug
mented with 2 percent, roughly 
$20,000, of the yearly JFC pool, said 
McKenna, but hasnt been added to 
in two years due to increasing num
bers of student organizations seek
ing funding.
The JFC may need to use the cur
rent balance of the fund for TESA 
locks and other additions and repairs 
for the third floor of the UC.

that stuff could start reallv addin?

up, she said.
By Wednesday or Thursday, said 
McKenna, the budget information of 
all organizations will be made pub
lic, but until then she refused to com
ment on individual appeals.
CMUTV came out on top; after 
expecting a $5,000 cut from last 
years allotment, their appeal yield
ed approximately $2,600 of it back, 
making the purchase of a long-awaited new editing bay possible early 
next semester, according to senior 
double major in English and ECE 
Charlie Butcosk, president of 
CMUTV.
Presidents of both the Taiwanese 
Student Association (TSA) and 
WRCT refused to comment on the 
organizations budgets or appeals.
But the biggest event of this years 
JFC has been the appeal of the 
Activities Board (AB), whose 
$30,000 loss from last year has 
forced a meticulous budget restruc
turing.
Chair Fred Merkle, an ECE senior, 
wishes AB could do more with the 
$11,000 it is receiving to supplement 
its earlier allotment.
AB Special Events will have signigicantly less money to provide the 
campus with randomly spontaneous 
interesting events like Geek Week, et 
cetera, Merkle said. AB Films may 
have to reduce the number of movie 
showings. AB Comedy will not be 
able to bring an act on par with Dave 
Atell.

Baghdad falls; U.S. 
troops secure city
Baghdad (AP)  Saddam 
Husseins rule over the capital has 
ended, U.S. commanders declared 
Wednesday, and jubilant crowds 
swarmed into the streets here, danc
ing, looting, cheering U.S. convoys 
and defacing images of the Iraqi 
leader.
U.S. Marines helped bring down a 
giant statue of Saddam in a central 
square of Baghdad to the applause of 
Iraqis standing below. The statue top
pled when a rope tied to it was 
hooked up to a military vehicle that 
backed away.
Earlier, U.S. troops placed an 
American flag over the statues face, 
but it was quickly removed.
The capital city is now one of 
those areas that has been added to 
the list of where the regime does not 
have control, said Brig. Gen. Vincent 
Brooks at U.S. Central Command in 
Qatar.
Brooks said that Saddam loyalists 
were holding out in the north, 
notably at Saddams hometown of 
Tikrit, and still posed a threat, includ
ing the possible use of weapons of 
mass destruction
Even as they encountered sniper 
fire from roving bands of holdout 
fighters, Marine and Army units 
swept through Baghdad, seizing or 
destroying buildings that once 
housed some of Saddams most 
feared security forces. Marine tanks 
rolled into the heart of the city, on the 
east bank of the Tigris, greeted by 
people clapping and waving white 
flags.
Civilians gestured to the Americans 
with V-for-victory signs. We were 
nearly mobbed by people trying to 
shake our hands, said Maj. Andy 
Milburn of the 7th Marines. One 
Army contingent had to use razorwire to hold back surging crowds of 
well-wishers.
At police stations, universities, gov
ernment ministries, the headquarters 
of the Iraq Olympic Committee, loot
ers unhindered by any police pres
ence made off with computers, furni
ture, telephones, even military jeeps. 
One young man used roller skates to 
wheel away a refrigerator.
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Bush, 
some of the looters shouted. An elder
ly man beat a portrait of Saddam with 
his shoe, while a younger man spat on 
the portrait.
Not everyone rejoiced.

U.S. says Saddams 
brother is captured
WASHINGTON (AP)  Several top 
officials of Saddam Flusseins regime 
in Iraq, including the presidents halfbrother and a former science adviser, 
have been captured by allied forces.
The Iraqis are being interrogated 
about Iraqs suspected chemical, bio
logical, and nuclear weapons pro
grams, U.S. officials said Sunday. 
They are also being pressed about 
Saddams location and whether he is 
alive, as well as the whereabouts of 
other former Iraqi leaders.
The captured Iraqis include 
Watban Ibrahim Hasan, one of 
Saddams three half-brothers, who 
once served as Iraqs interior minis
ter. Hasan was the five of spades in 
the deck of playing cards the U.S. mil
itary issued with pictures of wanted 
Iraqi officials.
The wars commander, Gen. 
Tommy Franks, said Sunday that the 
United States was holding several 
high-ranking Iraqi prisoners in west
ern Iraq. Neither he nor Pentagon 
officials would say how many leading 
Iraqis have been captured.
As the fighting in Iraq winds down, 
American forces are stepping up the 
search for the chemical and biological 
weapons the United States accuses 
Saddams government of having 
stashed away. So far, no caches of 
weapons of mass destruction have 
been confirmed in Iraq, military offi
cials said Sunday.
U.S. forces have a list of 2,000 to 
3,000 sites in Iraq that need to be 
checked, and weapons teams are 
checking up to 20 sites a day, Franks 
said. Iraqis ranging from common 
people to high-ranking officials have 
suggested other possible hiding 
places to be searched, Franks and 
other military officials said.
There are so many sites, we are 
not able to get to all of them right 
away, a senior Pentagon official said
This is the destruction of Islam, 
said Qassim al-Shamari, 50, a laborer 
wearing an Arab robe. After all, Iraq 
is our country. And what about all the 
women and children who died in the 
bombing?
Even as most of the populace 
seemed suddenly to feel free of 
Saddams control, U.S. officers said 
their forces faced continued resist
ance, fierce but disorganized, from 
small groups of holdout pro-Saddam 
fighters. The U.S Central Command 
reacted cautiously to the euphoria 
and chaos in Baghdad.
The regime has lost control in 
most parts of Iraq, said command 
spokesman Jim Wilkinson. There are 
places up north where they have sig
nificant pockets ... so well continue 
to go where those pockets are and 
reduce them. Itll just take time to 
find those pockets and destroy them 
and hopefully theyll surrender.
Dozens die during 
Nigerian elections
LAGOS, Nigeria (AP)  Fighting 
between tribal and political rivals dis
rupted legislative elections in 
Nigerias oil-producing south for a 
second day Sunday. At least two 
dozen people were killed in the vot
ing and hundreds forced to flee their 
homes, witnesses said.
The vote for 469 seats is a key 
gauge of civil tensions a week ahead 
of presidential elections and an 
important test for democracy in 
Africas most populous nation. 
Military coups have scuttled Nigerias 
previous attempts to hold democrat
ic, civilian-run elections.
The voting began on Saturday but 
was extended to Sunday in several 
areas where the balloting was 
marred, particularly the Niger Delta.
The oil-rich region has been the 
scene of numerous clashes in recent 
weeks between Ijaw militants and 
government troops over voting dis
tricts the Ijaws say favor their ethnic 
rivals, the Itsekiris.
More than 100 people have been 
killed in the violence, which has shut 
down 40 percent of the countrys oil 
production. Nigeria is the fifthlargest supplier of U.S. oil imports.
On Sunday, sustained automatic 
weapons fire delayed a second 
attempt to hold a vote in Warri.
Witnesses said navy soldiers and 
Ijaw fighters were shooting at each 
other and spoke of between five and 
10 people killed. Grace Akpete, a 
market vendor who fled the fighting, 
said she saw five bodies floating in 
the water.
Sunday, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. Its fair to say there are a 
lot of places U.S. forces are adding to 
the list.
One former Iraqi official who could 
provide major help for the hunt is Lt. 
Gen. Amer al-Saadi, who surrendered 
to American forces on Saturday. AlSaadi, the seven of diamonds in the 
U.S. deck of cards, was Saddams 
point man on weapons of mass 
destruction before the Iraqi govern
ment collapsed.
Bouncer dead from 
smoking ban brawl
NEW YORK (AP)  A bouncer at a 
Manhattan nightclub died Sunday 
after he was stabbed in a brawl that 
police said began when he tried to 
enforce the citys new ban on smok
ing in bars and restaurants.
Dana Blake, 32, died about 11 
hours after the late-night fight in an 
East Village nightclub.
Police arrested two brothers, 
Johnathan and Ching Chan, shortly 
after the fight and charged them with 
assault. Prosecutors had not decided 
Sunday whether to upgrade the 
charges because of Blakes death.
Blake approached the men about 
2:30 am to tell them they could not 
smoke in the bar, police spokesman 
Michael OLooney said. It was unclear 
whether one or both men were smok
ing, he said.
Harsh words were exchanged, and 
the brawl began when Blake tried to 
eject Johnathan Chan for disorderly 
behavior, witnesses told police. Blake 
was stabbed in the fight, but it was 
unclear who stabbed him or with 
what, OLooney said.
The smoking ban took effect late 
last month.
It could not immediately be deter
mined if the brothers had lawyers.
Blakes older brother, Tony Blake, 
said Sunday he blamed the death on 
the smoking ban. Im very bitter, he 
said. Its a senseless murder because 
of this stupid cigarette law. Thats the 
reason this guy was killed.

Grisly dump truck 
accident kills two
GLEN ROCK, Pa. (AP)  A dump 
truck that lost control while driving 
down a steep hill slammed into par
ents and children at a school bus stop, 
killing a woman and her daughter 
and critically injuring two children.
Authorities were still investigating 
Friday afternoons multiple-vehicle 
crash, but police chief Jim Childs said 
it appeared the truck was too heavy 
to have been legally traveling on the 
hill in Glen Rock.
The Blossom Valley Farms truck 
was carrying a load of dirt when the 
driver said he lost his brakes, though 
police did not say how much the 
truck weighed. The roads weight 
limit is three-quarters of a ton.

she saw the truck coming.

she said. I didnt know why he 
swerved toward them. It was really

hill. I heard the guy shouting, Watch 
out!
The truck ran over a 9-year-old boy 
on the road and slammed into a car 
stopped at a stop sign, pushing the 
car into the intersection and leading 
to collisions involving three other 
cars, police said.

injuring four, the police said.
The victims, who were driving 
from Niagara Falls, N.Y., to 
Washington, had just left a 
McDonalds restaurant and were 
heading down Bald Eagle Mountain 
near Williamsport around 2 pm when 
the driver lost control of the vehicle, 
the police said.
The Chevrolet van skidded off the 
road, went airborne, and slammed 
into a tree 11 feet off the ground, 
Montgomery Police Chief Terry Lynn 
said. Snow was falling in the area 
throughout the day, and the road was 
slushy at the. time of the crash.
The authorities said that only one 
of the injured spoke fluent English 
and that officials had difficulty com
municating with the survivors.
The four survivors were taken to a 
hospital in Williamsport. One passen
ger had only minor injuries, but two 
others were in critical condition with 
head injuries, and the driver was in 
serious condition with a hip fracture. 
The authorities did not release the 
names of the victims last night 
because they were trying to contact 
their families.

United States to visit various colleges

Professor charged 
after plague scare
LUBBOCK, Texas (U-WIRE)  
The Texas Tech University Health 
Sciences Center professor arrested 
in conjunction with a plague scare 
in January was indicted on 15 
counts Thursday.
The charges against Dr. Thomas 
Butler cover a variety of crimes, 
including illegally transporting the 
bacteria and making false state
ments to the FBI and other federal 
agencies involved in the incident.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Dick 
Baker declined to comment on the 
charges because the investigation 
is ongoing.
The first count alleges Butler 
imported the Yersinia pestis bacte
ria from Tanzania by commercial 
airlines in April 2002. He did not 
have a permit from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention.
There are two counts of smug
gling merchandise into the United 
States, also on commercial airlines 
in April, that should have been 
invoiced. There are three counts of 
transporting smuggled goods 
using his personal vehicle, Federal 
Express, and commercial airlines.
There also are three counts of 
illegal transportation of hazardous 
materials, as well as one count of 
unauthorized export to Tanzania 
in September using Federal 
Express.
Three of the counts are for giv
ing false statements to the laboraPrevious Week
tory safety officer and responsible 
facility official and to two FBI agents 
after reporting the slides missing and 
presumed stolen.
One of these also alleged Butler 
gave a false statement to two agents, 
stating he was unaware of the 
requirement for transferring select 
agents, when he was indeed aware of 
them.
A fourth false statement count 
alleges he filed a false export control 
document, which stated the goods 
were laboratory materials instead of 
listing the type of bacteria.
The last count is for making and 
subscribing to a false income tax 
return. According to the indictment, 
in 2001, Butler reported more than 
$120,000 under Legal and 
Professional Services, when the cor
rect amount was $7,400. This state
ment allegedly resulted in an under
statement of almost $40,000 on his 
tax return, according to a news 
release from the U.S. Attorneys 
office.

Woman gets $6K 
for bad hairstyle
ST. LOUIS (AP) A jury award
ed $6,000 to a woman who sued a 
hair salon, claiming that bad hair 
treatment left her depressed and 
led her to seek early retirement.
Geremie Hoff, 56, of suburban 
Creve Coeur, sued the Elizabeth 
Arden Salon for emotional distress, 
depression, counseling, and lost 
income.
According to testimony, Hoff 
went to the salon Aug. 9, 2001, to 
have her curly hair straightened.
Stylist Reye Hudson, who is still 
with the salon but was not named 
in the suit, applied a hair relaxer, 
then washed and styled Hoffs hair.
Hoff testified that clumps of her 
hair came loose that night, and her 
resulting bald spots and brittle hair 
made her depressed and reclusive. 
Her daughter testified about Hoffs 
emotions, as did a psychiatrist and 
counselor.
Man attacks own

LONDON (AP)  A business
man who attacked his own pub 
with a bulldozer after staff refused 
to serve him a drink was sentenced 
Friday to 200 hours of community 
service.
Robert Tyrrell was also ordered 
to pay $4,700 in compensation 
and court costs.
Tyrrell pleaded guilty at an earli

the 16th-century North Star Inn in 
Steventon, 55 miles northwest of 
London, on New Years Day.
Photos showed the timbered 
building  described in a local

News reports said it will cost up to 
$112,000 to repair the damage.
Puppy fine after 
swallowing knife
LONDON (AP)  A puppy that 
swallowed a kitchen knife nearly 
the length of his body is back to his 
playful self after an operation to 
remove it.
The baffled owners of 12-weekold Jake took him to the vet when 
they noticed him vomiting and try
ing to keep his body in a straight 
line.
X-rays revealed why the puppy 
was so reluctant to curl up: A 
kitchen knife was running through 
his body, with the plastic handle at 
the base of his pelvis and the blunt
ed metal point at the top of his 
throat.
Dogs are always swallowing 
strange things, from kebab sticks 
to corn-on-the-cobs to tape cas
settes, but this was particularly 
unusual because it was such a 
large knife in a small puppy. It real
ly did run the length of his body, 
said veterinarian Christina 
Symonds on Wednesday.
The owner, John Mallett, 22, 
said he knew something was 
wrong but had no idea the 
Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross had 
swallowed the knife.

U. Pitt protestors 
hold mock funeral
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  A dif
ferent kind of war protest marched 
through Oakland late Thursday 
afternoon, giving rush-hour com
muters something to gawk at on 
their way home.
Large numbers of police officers 
circled the block around the 
Cathedral of Learning with lights 
flashing, monitoring the gathering 
of about 75 people, who silently and 
solemnly walked as a mock funeral 
procession to acknowledge those 
who have been killed in Iraq.
Carrying two empty coffins at the 
head of the group, the marchers 
stopped at the University of 
Pittsburgh sign at Fifth and 
Bellefield avenues, where the 
Raging Grannies, an organization 
of elderly women for peace, sang a 
song. One young man came in 
makeup that made it look as if his 
head had been blown open, and a 
friend wore a T-shirt that read, I 
was killed by American bombs.
Some of the marchers covered 
their faces with bandanas but said 
they didnt expect any trouble, a 
sentiment that was echoed by sever
al police officers.
Beth Pittinger, the executive 
director of the Citizens Police 
Review Board, shadowed the pro
testers and police.
The first march didnt go so 
well, Pittinger said. There were 
lots of police from different areas 
involved. The Pittsburgh police have 
their issues with that march, 
Pittinger continued. But she also 
said, As long as the Pittsburgh 
police are the dominant force, its 
fine.
Pittinger referred to a march 
about a week ago that ended with a 
clash between Edgewood and 
Swissvale police and several pro
testers. She said that everything 
went smoothly until the marchers 
were out of Pittsburgh police juris
diction.
The March 20 incident involved 
some of the protesters who marched 
on Thursday.
Jonas Moffat, of the Palestine 
Solidarity Committee, told fellow 
marchers that he was brutalized 
while in custody at the county jail. 
Charged with failure to disperse and 
blocking public passage, Moffat
passed around letters condemning 
the conduct of police and collected 
signatures on a letter that urged the 
charges be dropped.
They claimed that they told us to 
disperse, Moffat said, but when you 
tried to leave, you were beaten and 
arrested.
Moffats trial is set for April 11, and 
he and his ACLU-appointed lawyer 
are considering bringing a civil suit 
against the county policeman who 
allegedly banged Moffats head off 
the wall of his cell for having a smirk 
on [Moffats] face.
Greeks raise drunk 
driving awareness
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  After a 
long night of studying on December 
1, 1999, Gina Cancelliere left the 
Pennsylvania State University library 
and began the long trek back to her 
off-campus apartment. She never 
made it there. On the way there, 
Cancelliere was hit by a pickup truck 
that didnt have its headlights on. She 
suffered two collapsed lungs, a lacer
ated liver, damaged optic nerves, and 
fractured her pelvic bone, pubic 
bone, ribs, and tailbone. The drivers 
blood-alcohol level was .17 percent.
While Cancelliere managed to sur
vive, most victims of drunken driving 
are not so lucky. Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving (MADD) reported that 
in 2000, a drunk driver killed some
one every half hour. In addition, 
young drivers are involved in alcohol 
related crashes more than any other 
age group.
These kinds of statistics have 
alarmed more than just a few people 
on Pitts campus. Wednesday, 336 Pitt 
students sported black T-shirts that 
read I was killed by a drunk driver 
in an effort to not only raise money 
for MADD, but also to raise students 
awareness about deaths resulting 
from drunk driving.
The event, led by Josh Butler of 
Delta Tau Delta, included members of 
his fraternity, six sororities and a 
number of independent groups. All 
last week, they set up tables around 
the Union and in Litchfield Towers 
lobby to collect donations from pass
ing students. Their efforts earned 
MADD just under $200.
But, Butler said, money wasnt the 
goal.
I want to stress that this was an 
awareness thing first, fundraiser sec
ond, he said. The major point was 
to raise awareness to the alarming' 
statistics, then to give awareness to 
MADD, as well.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 14, 2003
Debate revealed disagreement on JFC transparency
Bradford Yankiver/Photo Editor
Presidential candidates and their running mates gathered before about 30 students in the Connan Room last Tuesday night 
for The Tartans Presidential Candidates Debate. Pictured, from left: VP hopeful Gilbert Dussek, runing mate of Dan Gilman;

;ing facilities were sold to Parkhurst. 
Parkhurst is not beneficial for din
ing, he said
According to Gilman, overriding 
[Parkhursts contract is not a student 
decision, but one that lies with the 
administration.
.; The student body president can 
lonly provide feedback from his con
stituencies, said Gilman, and should 
riot pretend to have the power to 
Change things himself.
' * Echoing his platform for better 
^relations and communication 
between all member of the University 
community, Steenhuis said that din
ing cannot be changed unilaterally.
One thing a [student body] presi
dent cannot do is solve the problem 
of dining. One thing he can do is be a 
strong advocate, said Steenhuis.
A key issue for Moiseyev was pre
venting tuition hikes.
The current tuition cost is enough 
for the University to work on, said 
Moiseyev.
According to Gilman, there is a 
-need for tuition increases because 
'the economy is doing badly.
! - There are student representatives 
;on the Board of Trustees, but the 
decision ultimately lies in the upper 
-level of the administration. We just 
have to face reality, said Gilman.
Moiseyev said that although the 
Board of Trustees isnt required to 
take the recommendations of the 
SBP, his or her stance on an issue can 
make a significant impression.
Most things come through after 
constant lobbying, going to Warner 
Hall, and presenting the case. I dont 
understand why nothing has been 
tried and why the issue has not been 
touched, Moiseyev said.
Before the senate goes about lob
bying against a tuition hike, the rea
sons behind why they are being 
raised should be investigated, said 
Guzy.
Candidates disagreed vehemently 
about the merits of the current Joint 
Funding Committee (JFC) process.
Currently, 105 student organiza
tions are slated to receive a portion of 
the available $787,000 of funds in 
2003-2004.
This years JFC process cut ameni
ties like food and t-shirts, and 
brought some capital purchase cuts.
As a result, a dozen organizations 
are appealing, as is the Activities 
Board, whose larger budget cuts are 
being appealed separately.
Current Student Body President 
Brian Namey vetoed the Freedom of 
Information Act this past December, 
which denies the CMU community 
access to some budget information.
Candidates were divided on the 
issue of whether the act wouldve 
promoted a better working relation
ship between the JFC and its con
stituents.
Steenhuis thinks the JFCs distrib
ution woes should be made public.
CARNIVAL, from page A1
to prevent safety hazards during 
concerts.
Kramer was very pleased with 
how things went.
Im actually a pretty big fan of 
They Might Be Giants, Kramer said, 
and I think the concert was received 
as well as I could have hoped. We 
had to make a call at the last minute 
to put it in the gym as opposed to in 
the tent because it just would have 
been way too cold.
Concerts comprise a substantial 
part of the Carnival festivities.
Its all part of throwing an enter
taining Carnival, Kramer said, and 
This years increased student involve
ment was just as apparent in the 
number and quality of the many student bands that performed beneath 
ithe tent at Midway.
; We got a large amount of emails; 
-people definitely saw the postering 
that we did around campus about 
!how we wanted to find student acts. 
;As far as compared to years past, I 
think the student acts were better
Activities Board, Thistle, and real
ly large organizations are going to be 
practically dysfunctional as a result 
of severe mistakes and the unwilling
ness to confront these issues. Theres 
room for improvement, and thats to 
promote transparency, he said. I 
think its important that students 
have the ability to access information 
about how their student government 
is being run, and I think at the same 
time that can be done while protect
ing the interests of Booth and Buggy 
organizations. Five years ago, stu
dent organization budgets were all 
printed out and copies were made 
available at the information desk. 
When that was done, I hadnt heard 
of any problems.
Guzy agrees with Steenhuiss 
stance on promoting transparency.
We need to investigate where all 
the moneys going, look at each orga
nization, build networks with the 
organizations, cooperate, and show 
how it works, he said.
Moiseyev said the small amount of 
money the JFC has to work with is 
the problem.
The JFC process works well the 
current way that it is set up. We dont 
have a lot of money this year, so 
unfair cuts were made, he said. All 
candidates present at the debate sup
port the raising of the activities fee 
for students to help cover the 
requests from all the organizations.
Guzy is in favor of raising the activ
ities fee, but also cutting or combin
ing some organizations.
There is no simplistic approach; 
we will have to find a middle 
ground, he said.
Candidates discussed possible 
solutions to the Senates most pressthis year.... This year, people were 
pretty together about [their acts], 
said Kramer.
The substantial student involve
ment even made its way into the hir
ing of the face painters and jugglers 
for Midway; whereas previously they 
had all been professional entertain
ers, this year the Carnival committee 
decided to hire Carnegie Mellon art 
students for the face painting and to 
invite the juggling club for the jug
gling.
Bucking the trend of increases 
during Carnival, the number of peo
ple reporting for Midway watch 
shifts while intoxicated and the 
amount of drinking on Midway in 
general was at an all-time low, 
according to Miller.
Sergeant William Ricci of CMU 
Campus Police corroborated, adding 
that this years Carnival saw less mis
chief in general, especially in specif
ic areas.
Some Carnival years theres more 
vandalism than others, [but] this 
year there didnt seem to be much 
vandalism, said Ricci.
ing dilemmas, including the 
Academic Affairs Committees 
changing policies on plus/minus 
grading, the Internal Development 
Committees continued fight for the 
Freedom of Information Act, and lack 
of membership.
Steenhuis blames low involvement 
in the Senate.
I left Senate because there was no 
traction, no progress being made, 
and heavy interference from differ
ent branches that was counterpro
ductive. Im now refreshed, he said.
But Senators should not be taken 
for granted, said Moiseyev.
Its a difficult, thankless job, said 
Moiseyev. The student body presi
dent has to set an example and make 
it interesting and fun, make the work 
of the senators meaningful and moti
vate them to fight for things that 
theyre working on.
What those things are should be 
determined by the student bodys 
changing needs, said Gilman.
The student body president should 
not press favorite political issues 
either, said Steenhuis, who promised 
not to allow his own interests as head 
of the Progressive Student Alliance to 
affect his decisions and role as presi
dent.
Progressive politics are a part of 
who I am, but they will not interfere 
with the student government, said 
Steenhuis. I will focus on this cam
pus and not the world.
Steenhuis and Connors said that 
they would foster a community that 
does not end with the students.
We will represent both under
graduates and graduates, but it does
nt stop there. It goes on to the staff 
and faculty as well.
Though Midway infractions were 
down, Buggy saw a dozen alcoholrelated citations.
Said Ricci, We want to have zero 
use of alcohol at Buggy.... This year 
we had a very strong enforcement of 
the alcohol [policy] at the sweep
stakes.
As in years past, CMU alumni con
tinued to make their way to 
Pittsburgh to take part in the week
ends events and to catch up with old 
friends, in even greater numbers this 
year than ever before, according to 
Miller.
Carnival has become the time for 
everyone to know that everyone else 
is coming back ... weve had 
Carnival committee members here 
from the past ten years, said Miller.
This years Spring Carnival more 
than overcame the common 
Pittsburgh weather adversities to 
bring a record crowd to a campus 
that sported more student involve
ment than any could remember in 
recent years. When its all said and 
done, I think it was a great Carnival, 
said Ricci.
Guzy thinks CMUs attitude is in 
need of an adjustment.
Social growth and evolution are a 
part of the college process, and right 
now we are not up to par. There is a 
joke on campus about student apa
thy, and the sad part is that the joke is 
really on us. If elected, I will make 
the student voice known, said Guzy.
Gilman and Dussek stressed the 
importance of the presidents 
involvement in campus life.
Gilman is a brother of Sigma Phi 
Epsilon and the current vice presi
dent.
Dussek is an active member of the 
National Society of Black Engineers, 
Carnegie Mellon Action Project, and 
is a community advisor.
We represent an incredible 
amount of ground and lots of stu
dents feel comfortable coming to us, 
said Gilman. Without respect and 
trust, you lose power; its the level of 
experience and relationships that 
makes it work.
Moiseyev said he thinks a tougher 
stance will help. Not letting up is our 
approach. This is where power comes 
into play in our platform, Power and 
Greed. We will continue to do for the 
whole campus what we have been 
doing through the academic affairs 
committee, said Moiseyev. We 
dont take ourselves seriously, but we 
do our work.
Steenhuis emphasized participa
tion above all. We want a more 
deliberative democracy and we will 
work on it, he said. We need to be 
aggressive in asking people for their 
opinions.

Gardens, clutching a cloth over his 
face.
According to the police report, 
Millers head and arm were covered 
in blood, and his nose was visibly 
distorted.
Simonetti questioned Miller about 
the identity of the person who struck 
him.
After resisting, Miller named 
Ritchea.
Miller requested immediate med
ical transport before his nose could 
begin to swell.
He was taken to the emergency 
room of Presbyterian Hospital.
Both Miller and Sommermyer 
were ushered in as police explained 
the nature of Millers injuries.
At the hospital, when Simonetti 
asked Miller whether he would pre
fer the situation to be handled crim
inally or internally, Miller asked that 
the assault be handled internally.
After Simonetti returned to cam
pus, he was radioed to the Beta 
House, where Officers James 
Daggett, Clarence Hunt, Jason 
Hendershot, and Derrell Jefferson 
were requesting backup.
According to Officer Daggett, Beta 
members were refusing to cooperate 
with the polices attempts to locate 
Ritchea within Beta house.
Brothers were denying knowledge 
of the assault and then accidentally 
blurting out details of the assault to 
the police.
Because police could not locate 
Ritchea to confirm the citation and 
sign for it, and because all other 
members of the house refused to 
sign for or accept the citation indi
vidually, the Beta House was 
charged internally for Obstruction of 
Justice.
Ritchea was charged with simple 
assault, issuance pending.
Ritchea, Miller, and Sommermyer 
declined to comment.

On Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon 
recognized some of its own in the 
annual Education Awards.
Peggy Knapp, a professor of 
English, won the William H. and 
Frances S. Ryan Award, one of the 
highest teaching honors on cam
pus.
The award recognizes faculty 
who demonstrate unusual devo
tion and effectiveness in teaching 
undergraduate or graduate stu
dents.
According to David Kaufer, head 
of the English department, Knapp 
has a long and distinguished histo
ry at CMU.
Her students, current and 
alumni, speak of her deep exper
tise in medieval literature and cul
ture, [and] her broad knowledge, 
generally of the literary and aes
thetic traditions of the west, 
Kaufer said. Our award winners 
represent our finest examples of 
what we as a faculty strive to do 
and, for the most part, succeed to 
do seiriester in and out.
Knapps award is the second 
time a professor of English has 
been honored with the Ryan 
Award in the past four years.
Professor Jim Daniels was recog
nized in 1999.
Two faculty members from the 
Department of Chemical 
Engineering received awards this 
year.
Arthur Westerberg, professor of 
chemical engineering, was hon
ored with the Robert Doherty Prize 
for his substantial and sustained 
contributions to excellence in edu
cation.
Art is an intellectual giant in the 
field of design and chemical 
process design in particular, said 
Andrew Gellman, head of the 
chemical engineering department. 
He is largely responsible for the 
initiation and evolution of the very 
strong design program at CMU.
Westerberg has developed sever
al courses and is the co-author of a 
very successful textbook in the 
field of chemical process design.
He recently won the CACHE 
award of the American Society for 
Engineering Education (ASEE) for 
excellence in contributions to comJFC, from page A1
Some of ABs supplementary 
money is from the allotment of the 
UC Capital Equipment Fund.
This money will be used to keep 
readme in existence, said Merkle.
AB Concerts will remain unaf
fected, with a medium fall show 
and a large spring one.
AB can always use more, but this 
is more appropriate than the origi
nal JFC proposed budget, said 
Merkle.
Smaller organizations arent all 
content either.
CMU Baseball president Dan 
Bogard, a senior double major in 
Mechanical Engineering and 
Economics, thinks the JFCs 
processes are not as considerate as 
they could be.
Two years ago, we had 
$15,000, said Bogard. Our dropdead minimum proposal for the 
coming year was $10,900. We got 
$8,200.
The team charges players $100 
per semester, the highest dues 
Bogard knows of, and new players 
are charged $150 their first semes
ter.
All this directly reflects the prices 
of necessary uniform pieces, said 
Bogard.
When the JFC reviewed 
Baseballs budget, it cut all line 
items relating to uniforms from the 
budget  and kept the dues the 
same.
Were not replacing everything, 
were just covering for attrition, 
said H&SS freshman Matt Corbett, 
an outfielder on the team. Socks 
are only good for so long, pants 
wear out, hats get smelly and 
nasty.
CONSTANT, from page A1
was involved in a car accident, 
Boas told KDKA.
Common Pleas Judge David 
Cashman, who has handled 
Constants case from the begin
ning, also emphasized the distinc
tion.
Its an automobile accident, 
Cashman said, according to KDKA.
putational education.
Annette Moff Jacobson, princi
pal lecturer in the department of 
chemical engineering, was hon
ored with the Academic Advising 
Award.
The award seeks to recognize 
faculty who help students define 
and achieve their academic goals.
At the ceremony, Jacobson said 
she enjoys interacting with stu
dents and felt grateful that she was 
being honored for doing work she 
truly loves.
[Jacobson] has been the princi
pal driving force behind a large 
fraction of the education outreach 
done by CIT.
This has taken various programs 
and demonstrations to thousands 
of high school students in the local 
area, said Gellman.
Jacobson has been at Carnegie 
Mellon since starting as an under
graduate in 1974.
She came back to get a PhD and 
has been a lecturer in chemical 
engineering ever since 1989.
According to Gellman, Jacobson 
has worked closely with many stu
dents in the Colloids, Polymers 
and Surfaces program (CPS) and is 
the principal person running a 
Master Program in CPS that brings 
in people from local industries 
who wish to pursue continuing 
education at CMU. Graduate stu
dents were also honored for their 
work as teachers.
Dirk Schlimm received the grad
uate student teaching award for 
his work in the Philosophy 
Department, where he has worked 
with several professors and taught 
his own classes.
Sarah Pressman of the psycholo
gy department was recognized 
with the Graduate Student Service 
Award for her efforts in providing 
graduate students with a greater 
sense of community at CMU.
She has organized excursions 
and social gatherings for graduate 
students, including a white water 
rafting trip.
The recipients were selected by a 
committee of students and faculty, 
which included former award 
recipients.
They gathered information on 
each nominee through faculty 
course evaluations and letters of 
recommendation from students 
and colleagues.
It would be better to let players 
keep the uniform pieces that are 
not in any condition to be passed on 
to new members, said Bogard.
This can only happen if new uni
forms are purchased.
We had explained to the JFC 
that a lot of that $50 goes directly 
into things' people keep, said 
Bogard, who feels this dinstinction 
may have been glossed over.
It was carefully explained to 
[Baseballs JFC representative] 
Mike Quirolo that our dues are so 
high because they cover uniform 
items that players get to keep, like 
hats and socks and t-shirts that go 
under our game jerseys, said 
Bogard.
Baseballs equipment needs are 
also dire, said Bogard, and the new 
budget will make either new uni
forms, equipment or both an 
impossibility.
As of today, CMU Baseball is still 
waiting for an answer from the JFC.
Until they get back to us, we 
could have club baseball, but we 
wont be able to play enough games 
for it to be competitive. So wed 
lose competitive baseball. Either 
that or our practices would be a 
safety liability, said Bogard, who 
also thinks the JFCs treatment of 
major organizations like AB proves 
their long-term memory is foggy at 
best.
Anytime theyre cutting a major 
organizations budget by 20 per
cent, they should know better. You 
cant make that much change in 
one year, Bogard said.
The biggest problem [with 
Student Senate] is that Senate and 
the JFC dont have a collective 
memory because the individual 
people turn over too fast.
Looking at it as that  it wouldnt 
be a violation. The only time that it 
would arise to a violation is if the 
automobile accident had an alcohol 
component to it.
Although Constant had his 
license and passport revoked upon 
posting bail, he had explicit permis
sion to drive on certain occasions to 
meet with his bail officer and 
lawyer.

THE TARTAN
SARS alert
CMU researcher isolates 
himself from friends, family, 
and work as precaution
14 April 2003
by Karen Hoffmann
Assistant Science & Technology Editor
Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome, or SARS, kills three to 
five percent of its victims. It is 
thought to be the result of a coronavirus, which causes colds in 
humans and more severe illnesses in 
other animals, and is likely spread as 
a normal cold is spread  by 
droplets from coughing or sneezing.
The symptoms are similar to those 
of pneumonia: In general, SARS 
begins with a fever greater than 
100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, says the 
Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) website. Other 
symptoms may include headache, an 
overall feeling of discomfort, and 
body aches. Some people also expe
rience mild respiratory symptoms. 
After two to seven days, SARS 
patients mav develop a dry cough 
and have trouble breathing.
As of Friday, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) had reported 
2,960 worldwide cases of SARS, with 
119 deaths. These statistics include 
those of the U.S., although in this 
country, officials are using a wider 
net to identify cases of SARS. The 
CDC reports suspected cases, and 
the rest of the world reports proba
ble cases.
A suspected case of SARS is one 
in which a patient displays flu-like 
symptoms and has either traveled 
within the past ten days to mainland 
China, Hong Kong, Hanoi, or 
Singapore, or has had direct contact 
with a SARS patient.
There were 166 suspected cases in 
the U.S. at last count, five of them in 
Pennsylvania including one in south
western PA, though not in Allegheny 
County. We have a very limited 
number of people in this area who
travel to Asia, said Guillermo Cole, 
public information officer of the 
Allegheny County Health 
Department, in an interview with 
KDKA.
A suspected case becomes a proba
ble case when a chest X-ray shows 
pneumonia or respiratory distress 
syndrome. The rest of the world is 
reporting such probable cases.
The virus originated in 
Guangdong Province in southern 
China last November. There, people 
live in close proximity with farm ani
mals like pigs, ducks, and chickens, 
which would provide an easy way for 
the virus to jump species. When a 
virus from a chicken and a virus from 
a human infect the same cell, their 
genetic material can recombine to 
form a virus that will infect humans 
but to which humans will not be 
resistant.
An affected man from Guangdong 
went to Hong Kong and infected at 
least thirteen people. Now the virus 
has spread all over the world along 
international airline routes. One 
man with SARS took seven flights in 
a week.
The World Health Organization 
(WHO) is working with eleven labo
ratories in nine countries to work on 
the problem of identifying the virus. 
Also, several pharmaceutical compa
nies as well as government agencies 
have been given samples of the virus 
to create a vaccine.
Another top priority is making a 
test to diagnose the disease. There 
are two methods to look for the 
definitive presence of the SARS 
virus, said Phalguni Gupta, assistant 
chairman of the University of 
Pittsburghs Infectious Diseases and 
Microbiology department. The first 
is the enzyme-linked immunosor
bent assay (ELISA), in which pure 
samples of the virus are grown and
prepared , used as an antigen, and 
then tested in the patients serum to 
look for antibodies. The other 
method of diagnosing SARS is by 
using polymerase chain reaction, or 
PCR, to amplify a sequence from the 
patient and compare it to the 
sequence of the virus. A major break
through for this method occurred on 
Sunday, when a Canadian laboratory 
sequenced the genome of the SARS 
coronavirus.
This virus is transmitted through 
droplets, he said, as in sneezing or 
coughing. The particles are about 
five microns in diameter. If youre in 
a room with someone, its not like 
smallpox, where you would get the 
virus merely by breathing the spores 
in the air. Instead, said Gupta, the 
person must be within a two-person 
perimeter.
Many people are understandably 
worried about flying. The CDC is cre
ating a video to be shown on interna
tional flights explaining the precau
tions that should be taken. If you sit 
next to a person [with SARS], youll 
get infected, but if you sit in a far cor
ner, you wont get infected, said 
Gupta.
Gupta also said, This is not fatal 
for a young, healthy person. He 
feels that the lower  nonexistent at 
this point  death rate of SARS in 
the United States may be due to 
more young people than old people 
traveling.
He also expects that New York, 
San Francisco, Los Angeles, and 
Seattle are the cities where a SARS 
outbreak would be most likely, due 
to their large concentrations of Asian 
populations.
However, infectious disease expert 
C.J. Peters said in an interview with 
WebMD, I would not hesitate to fly 
to San Francisco, Portland, 
Vancouver, New York, or any of the 
large metropolitan centers with links 
to Asia and possibly with transiting 
passengers from Asia.

Anti-Asian sentiment has been 
reported in various places. Its very 
important that people appreciate 
that this is a respiratory illness 
caused by a virus, said Julie 
Gerberding, director of the CDC, in a 
telebriefing with journalists. It is 
not a disease that is in any way relat
ed to being Asian or to the fact that 
Asia happened to be the place where 
we first recognized cases.
Enoch Chan, a CMU graduate and 
former research assistant, was 
reported in the Pittsburgh PostGazette to have placed himself in 
self-quarantine after a trip to Asia. 
He did not develop any symptoms.
Carnegie Mellon has a large Asian 
student population, many of whom 
wont be traveling home this summer 
because of fears of the disease.
When the SARS virus is finally 
identified, it may be named after 
Carlo Urbani, the WHO doctor who 
died of the disease while treating 
patients in Hong Kong.

Plants act as new 
type of roofing
In the Pacific Northwest, growing 
numbers of people have chosen to 
seed their roofs with ferns and moss. 
These ecoroofs offer a variety of ben
efits, including lower heating costs, 
reduced runoff, and improved air 
quality. Europe is a leader in ecoroof 
technology, as there are several coun
tries in the region with stringent reg
ulations on roof runoff and destruc
tion of greenspace during construc
tion. Some factors holding ecoroofs 
back in the U.S. are the climate, 
which can dry out the roofs, and the 
cost of both the cover, which is about 
twice that of regular roofing materi
als, and the added supports to ensure 
that the weight of all the soil and 
plants (and possibly snow) on the 
roof wont cause it to collapse. 
Proponents hope that people will try 
to make up the difference in cost.

Elephants found 
to be able to run
Once, elephants were not thought 
to run. Now it is unclear. Researchers 
from Stanford and Thailand video
taped 42 Asian elephants and encour
aged them to move quickly by offer
ing treats, racing them against a 
trainer, or cheering them on. The 
joints were painted with white dots 
for easier analysis. The elephants had 
a top speed of around 25 kph (15.3 
mph), which would be fast enough to 
put elephants airborne (no feet 
touching the ground) long enough to 
be considering running.
While the hind limb moved down 
and up in the middle of the stride 
(one definition of running for 
quadrupeds), the shoulder still 
moved as if the elephant were walk
ing. The researchers believe this 
somewhat peculiar pace (nicknamed 
the Groucho gait) could be used to 
prevent the stress that would come 
from landing repeatedly. These stud
ies could be used to help obese people 
or people with weak muscles, as ele
phants have small muscles for their 
size.

Cloning may help 
save rare species
The Javan banteng, a bovine native 
of the jungles of Asia, became the first 
endangered species to be cloned suc
cessfully. Scientists in Iowa trans
ferred into beef cows dozens of 
embryos containing DNA from a ban
teng that died in captivity before it 
had the chance to reproduce. Two 
banteng have been born, though the 
second one is in poor health. The only 
other example of a cloned endan
gered species, the gaur, died from 
influenza two days after being born. 
Currently, it is feared that the loss of 
genetic diversity will deal a rough 
blow to the banteng, who already 
face trouble from loss of habitat and 
hunting. Should the newborn ban
teng stay healthy, they will be trans
ferred to a wildlife preserve and 
mated with captive banteng cows.

New anti-spam 
bill introduced
A bipartisan effort is underway to 
remove junk emails  spam  from 
peoples Inboxes. Senators Conrad 
Burns (R-Minn.) and Ron Wyden (DOre.) are co-sponsoring a bill that 
would require legitimate return 
addresses on all Internet marketers 
emails and require removing people 
who request removal. It would also 
provide for state attorney generals to 
sue spammers on behalf of the states 
consumers. The Federal Trade 
Commission would be able to fine 
spammers who dont follow the law, 
and Internet service providers could 
ban offending parties. The average 
Internet user in the U.S. received 
2,200 spam emails last year. The pro
fusion of spam has led the Direct 
Marketing Association to switch its 
position on an anti-spam bill, as legit
imate businesses worry that their 
messages would be deleted without a 
second look. A similar bill cleared the 
Commerce Committee last year, but 
was not taken up by the full Senate.

First of all, I want to apologize 
for the gross error that accompa
nied this column last week. If you 
tried to chug a keg of acetic acid 
over the weekend, please forgive 
me. As some have noticed, the 
chemical formula shown in the car
toon that accompanied this col
umn last week was, in fact, the 
structure of acetic acid, when I had 
intended for it to be the structure 
of alcohol. I wish I could blame my 
mistake on being drunk at the 
time, but actually, I was not. I was 
just doing too many things at once 
and not proofreading enough of 
them, and I sent our art depart
ment the wrong chemical structure 
for inclusion in the illustration. 
Where acetic acids structure 
includes a double-bonded oxygen 
(O) atom in the center of the mole
cule, there should be two single
bonded hydrogen (H) atoms for it 
to be alcohol.
And now for the fun part  how 
night vision devices work. The war 
in Iraq is winding down, but cutting-edge technology is still crucial 
to the way the U.S. is waging this

high-tech war.
Our tanks keep their guns level 
over rough terrain, our bombs 
know when to detonate, our mis
siles know where theyre going, 
our aircraft are invisible to radar, 
and our soldiers can see in the 
dark. Its all pretty amazing, even 
compared to the Gulf War of 1991. 
Being able to see in the dark can 
also come in handy for non-military purposes. Night vision devices 
come in two basic forms: thermal 
imaging systems and image 
enhancement systems. Thermal 
imaging systems create various 
types of images from the heat given 
off by objects, also known as 
infrared light. The best of these 
devices can provide useful pictures 
of people from as far away as 1000 
feet. You may have seen videos 
from such a system on police chase 
TV shows if a suspect was being 
chased through a wooded area by a 
helicopter.
When most military personnel 
refer to NVDs (Night Vision 
Devices), however, theyre refer

variety. As the name implies, these

Game Boy Advance SP almost perfect
by Alexander Meseguer
Science & Technology Editor
The world is seeing yet another 
step in the evolution of the ubiqui
tous Nintendo Game Boy. Five-yearolds love it; grad students play it in 
the backs of their classrooms. 
Nintendo has been delivering quality 
product after quality product; this is 
not propaganda and it is not bull. 
Wind Waker blew the gaming com
munity away, and the Game Boy 
Advance SP is set to do the same 
with something as small as a little 
button adorned with a sun-like icon.
It arrived in a small, non-descript 
white box. I inspected the package 
for any signs of anthrax or other 
white powders and opened the box 
to reveal a shiny, compact rectangu
lar prism. At first, I was puzzled.
It was far too small to be the 
expected item, and much 
too large to be that new 
memory stick I ordered.
Upon inspection of the 
other side, the silver 
Nintendo emblem was 
revealed, confirming 
the devices identity.
This one has a 
capability that 
does not exist in 
any other incarna
tion of a Game Boy: the ability to 
open. With a solid-feeling hinge and 
the familiar near-HDTV-proportioned screen, the quality of its con
struction is immediately apparent. 
Although it is made entirely of plas
tic, the buttons are firm and click 
precisely. Nintendo actually did the 
screen right this time, making it suf
ficiently bright. Controls for the 
screen are conspicuously absent, 
being left up to software operation, 
which is only as comprehensive as 
the planning of the game program
mers. The new backlight makes sav
ing the universe possible

additional work with specific case

researcher, in terms of constantly 
tackling research questions and new 
ideas, should prepare me to tackle 
my role as an advisor to the National

Bryant received his BS in Applied

MIT in 1981. He came to CMU in 
1984, where he later began his sec
ond research thrust in Formal 
Verification, a field which attempts to 
prove that a circuit will work mathe
matically instead of using a large but 
limited number of test cases. He also 
developed techniques for represent

a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) 
and implemented them in algo
rithms. These are used in software 
verification, testing, and artificial

Randal Bryant, head of the 
Computer Science Department, was 
elected to the National Academy of 
Engineering (NAE) last February. He 
owes his entrance into the field of 
computer technology to an interest in 
combining hardware with a mathe
matical and scientific understanding 
of how the hardware works after 
being exposed to large computers 
and punch cards, which led him to 
pursue computer science as a 
research topic in graduate school. His 
current research involves modeling 
and verifying both hardware and 
software systems.
Bryants election into the NAE 
resulted from his work over the past 
twenty years in the fields of electron
ic simulation and testing. Many of his 
contributions have been accepted as 
standards throughout the electronics 
industry.
Bryant began his research into the 
switch-level simulation of transistor 
circuits after being frustrated on a 
class project by his inability to try out 
a circuit in the same way program
mers can compile and test their pro
grams. Switch-level simulation mod
els the actual circuit design using 
only simple mathematical models. 
This was the focus of his PhD work at 
MIT and later as a professor at Cal 
Tech, where he implemented the next 
generation of the simulation tools.

Candidates have been better
but cast your vote regardless
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the largest pool 
, of students in CMU history will likely go online 
to vote, but it is the technology and the policy 
of elections stirring the interest, not the lack
luster set of presidential candidates. The 
favorite of the race, current student body vice 
president Dan Gilman, is little more than a 
shadow of who he hopes to succeed. A vote for 
Gilman is a safe bet at least, as last Tuesday's 
presidential debate revealed. While he has 
only a fraction of the political guile and charm 
of current president Brian Namey, hes not 
bringing anything new to the table. At least 
hell get Nameys Rolodex.
A long-shot gambler might side with 
Quinten Steenhuis in hopes of a big payoff 
from his radical politics, and the naive will 
likely vote for Steenhuis, after somehow swal
lowing that one of the most radical activists on 
campus will keep his peacenik politics off of 
the rest of the student bodys plate. But long 
shots backfire, and the student bodys needs 
will skip a beat or get totally lost in a mael
strom of progressive ideas not meant for meet
ings between the Dean and the student body 
president.
Michael Moiseyev, better known for his KGB 
antics than for his political track record, may 
get more votes than he deserves this year. 
Crass language and poor jokes at the debate 
might otherwise have turned voters off, but in 
a famine year such as this, it cant help to stick 
out a bit. Then again, his running mate 
brought a bottle of beer to the debate, and this 
is what will make or break Moiseyevs second 
place finish; it just depends on what percent
age of voters decide the pair was too stupid to 
know the University would take offense at bla
tant drinking in the University Center, and 
what percentage think they knew and did not 
care.
First-year Ben Hackett, who, along with his 
running mate, is of Delta Upsilon, will serve as 
a semi-spoiler in the coming election, dragging 
on Gilmans Greek vote to slim the margin 
between Gilman and the pack.
William Guzy elected not to attend the 
debate, and when asked about his views, said 
little more than he will make the student 
voice known, so he rounds out the candidate 
pool blandly.
Come midnight Wednesday, the student 
body will have a new president-elect, be slight
ly worse off than before, and promptly forget 
the name of whomever they elect. Its going to 
be a tough year for the student voice on cam
pus with Student Senate already in disarray 
and the executive branch headed down the 
drain.
Chances of disaster are higher if Moiseyev or 
Steenhuis attains the office, mostly because 
the administration at CMU is less likely to work 
smoothly with either one than with Gilman. 
But Gilman will be half as effective as Namey, 
who probably needed to be half again as effec
tive as he has been to be a truly great student 
body president.
Nonetheless, cast your vote for the lesser of 
the five evils this week. The student body 
ought at least keep its own voice alive, even if 
our amplifier is a bit weak, dumb, or drunk 
from year to year.
Home Despot: US should not 
build a nation, set Iraqi future
The war in Iraq may be officially over 
within the week, ending one of the United 
States shortest  and most successful  
military campaigns. We hope, however, that 
the Bush administration does not see the 
militarys triumph as a mandate for future 
attempts at regime change. Preemptive 
strikes and a hard line foreign policy gam
bles the nations long-term security against 
a loss of international respect in the here 
and now. The President has not yet bran
dished his pistol against the other charter 
countries in the so-called axis of evil but has 
unofficially declared Syria as the newest 
member of the worlds most elite evil-doers.
On Sunday, the President said that Syria 
is harboring displaced Iraqi government 
officials and chemical weapons.
Although he has emphatically asked for 
cooperation from Syrian leaders, he has not 
threatened military force to ensure his 
demands are met.
Each situation will require a different 
response, said Bush.
Despite the Presidents awkward endorse
ment of diplomacy versus destruction, the 
events leading up to an attack on Iraq is 
nearly identical to that in Syria or North 
Korea.
Contrary to assurances from the President 
and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, 
the real distinction between Iraq and these 
other evil-doers is the possession of natur
al resources. An oil-rich Iraqi regime allied 
with the U.S. is a much better alternative to 
Middle East nations of compromised posi
tions like Saudi Arabia.
There has been a very thin line drawn in 
the Middle East sand. Due largely to new 
trade with European countries, Iran has 
adopted dmocratie principles relatively 
quickly for a radical Islamic country. 
However, the U.S. classifies Iran as an
emerging nuclear threat and a state sponsor 
of terrorism. Iran denies a nuclear program, 
arguing that newly built reactors are for 
civilian electricity. The country justifies its 
donations to Hezbollah, a terrorist organi
zation that seeks Palestinian liberation, as a 
compelling interest for Arabs and Muslims.
Other nations like Egypt still imprison 
and torture political dissenters, yet have 
avoided liberation attempts by the U.S. 
Likewise, Qatar bans civil demonstrations 
but remains an ally of the United States and 
a business partner of Carnegie Mellon.
There are several dozen repressive and 
despicable governments in the world. 
Applying the Iraqi war principles toward 
additional military campaigns against them 
jeopardizes much more than their stability; 
it undermines the historical tenet of selfdetermination and unjustly permits the 
United States to serve as the worlds moral 
compass.
A course of perpetual war for perpetual 
peace would undoubtedly mean a high cost 
to American taxpayers and a high risk to 
American lives. Increased forays into the 
heart of the Middle East in a Marshall Plan
like rebuilding process could potentially 
subject us to increased terror threats at 
home.
In addition, occupation by U.S. troops 
inside places like Iraq or Syria places them 
at the mercy of opportunistic killers  
theres nothing a terrorist would like more 
than about 50,000 American soldiers sitting 
in his backyard.
The U.S. must pursue a policy of strategic 
independence abroad. The current adminis
tration has us on quite the opposite course; 
we can only hope that its globetrotting 
exploits and nation-building fantasies do 
not produce another tragedy on the level of 
September 11, 2001.

Bum Lee/Art 'Editorconscription hurts us allDraft dodging:
Andrew Conklin
The war in Iraq has rekindled a generation-old debate: 
whether or not the United States needs a military draft. 
Congressman Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat, and his 
beltway cronies believe that the government should insti
tute compulsory military service. Railing that minorities 
and the poor are fighting and dying in rich, white politi
cians wars, these liberals naively want a draft to make the 
military more representative of society. Rangel introduced a 
draft bill to Congress earlier this year. Not only is the mili
tary quite a reasonable snapshot of the American popula
tion, but a volunteer force is favorable to a conscripted force 
for every reason including morale, skill, economics, and the 
general welfare of all Americans.
Morale is perhaps the most obvious advantage of a volun
teer force. No matter how popular the military or a war may 
be, a draft will inevitably dump people into the armed forces 
who dont want to be there. Even World War II, an enor
mously popular war, had its protestors. Fast-forward 30 
years to the Vietnam Era and we have people burning draft 
cards in protest and fleeing to Canada to escape conscrip
tion and angry draftees fragging  tossing live grenades 
into their officers tents. Americans dont like being forced 
to do anything.
A volunteer military will also be better skilled than a con
scripted military, as recruits will stay in the service longer 
and serve in the branch and MOS (military occupational 
specialty) best suited to their preferences and skills. 
Between the Montgomery GI Bill, which sends every inter
ested soldier to college, and the extensive pensions avail
able earlier than in corporate America, volunteers have 
more than enough incentive to stay in the service and 
become better skilled and experienced. But if a draftee does
nt want to serve, he will do his time and get out, and money 
might not be incentive enough to stay. Higher turnover
means higher training costs as well. H
In fact, a volunteer force costs less across the board. Draft 
advocates salivate at reducing payroll and incentive pack
ages once we dont have to bribe people to enlist. They ar&ue 
that a conscripted military will cost less because we wont 
have to pay soldiers as much, but it will only be cheaper-ior 
those not serving.
If an entire nation of taxpayers cannot provide enough 
money to employ a volunteer military, can we justify asking 
the nations 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old men, the demographic 
from which a conscripted force would surely be drawn, to 
bear that economic burden? A nations military should 
embody the combined strength of every citizen. Those not 
providing their time, strength, intellect, or life instead com
pensate by providing their money.
Rangel and his cohorts anchor their pro-conscription 
argument in the idea of equal representation in the ranks. 
Employing slogans like For those who say the poor fi^ht 
better, I say give the rich a chance, draft-pushing politi
cians would have us believe that the military is dispropor
tionately comprised of minorities and members of the lower 
classes. However, their statistics only deal with the enlis'ged 
force. The military as a whole has a lower percentage of rich 
people, but also a lower percentage of poor people. It has a 
higher percentage of blacks than the general population, 
but a lower percentage of Hispanics. High school graduates 
are much better represented, but college graduates are 
slightly fewer than the norm.
In essence, the American military is an accurate slice,jjot 
of America in its entirety, but of Middle America. 
Congressman Rangel has tried to spin the demographic 
breakdown of our military by focusing solely on the enlisted 
ranks, but in an all-volunteer force, one must take into 
account the characteristics and backgrounds of everyone 
who volunteers, regardless of the type of service for wf}ch 
they volunteer.J retRangel also wants politicians children in the military. He

Beers Day a sober reminder of freedoms
Dain Pascocello
There is not much left to say anymore 
regarding Prohibitions grotesque failure. 
Occasionally, a few new facts are exhumed
 consumption numbers, instances of cor
ruption, and Mafioso testimony  but 
largely, these exist in the realm of scholarly 
debate, and anyway do not much affect our 
general impression that Prohibition was a 
bad thing. Last Monday was the anniversary 
of Beers Day, when the federal govern
ments Bureau of Prohibition once again 
allowed brewers to produce beer after a 
decades ban on the practice. The date pref
aces the official end to Prohibition, the more 
widely-known 21st Amendment, made the 
law of the land in 1933. To celebrate, on 
Monday many brewpubs around the coun
try offered bargain beers and drink specials 
in order to get thirsty patrons through their 
swinging doors. For example, in Colorado, 
the Rocky Mountain News reported on spots 
like Flying Dog Brewery, which offered liba
tions for 33 cents, commemorating the year 
of repeal. Colorado passed a proscription on 
the sale and manufacture of alcoholic bever
ages in 1915, four years before the 18th 
Amendment made it illegal throughout the 
rest of the country. All told, there are 
approximately 1,440 brewers in the United 
States, each carrying on a tradition that was
temporarily suspended but not forgotten for 
thirteen years, from 1920 to 1933.
Prohibitions gross failures  from con
ception through application  can be 
attributed to peoples, especially.American 
peoples, inherent attraction to what econo
mists call mutually beneficial exchanges. 
The term in play here basically describes 
any action where one actor, say, a beer 
drinker, receives a product or service that 
satisfies his demand  inebriation, for 
instance  while at the same time satisfying 
the demands of the bartender, who wants 
money for the pint he pulls. So-called vice 
laws did little to stanch the flow of alcohol 
into 1920s saloons and speak-easies, just as 
modern day drug laws operate from a simi
lar strain of twenty-first-century 
Comstockery.
Prohibitions flawed history should make 
us rethink our present drug debate and take 
steps to reform a system so completely inept 
that marijuana is currently easier to obtain 
than a six-pack for your average fourteenyear-old. Individual choice will always 
trump governmental fiat; the point is to 
make our consumption laws, in terms of 
alcohol and drugs, more reconcilable with 
basic realities than further trampling the 
rights of individuals who take personal 
responsibility seriously.
The central problem with sweeping legis
lation like Prohibition is that it targets envi
ronmental problems related to, but not 
directly resulting from, alcoholic consump
tion. Individual rights inevitably suffered as 
lawmakers scrambled to put together rules
intended to protect large swaths of society 
from perceived, often imaginary, threats. 
Absenteeism, bar fights, and alcoholism - 
these were main concerns for politicians 
who looked to fight consumption and rffanufacture. By pushing down the supply, they 
argued, demand would naturally decrease 
as a matter of course. Current statistics 
reveal that, although the amount of alcohol 
consumed within the U.S. decreased at first, 
reduced consumption rates were inflated 
and actually rose fairly steadily after the ini
tial drop.
Two American economists, Irving Fisher 
and Clark Warburton, writing in The 
Economic Results of Prohibition and 
Prohibition at Its Worst, respectively, saw 
that specious numbers led to faulty policy 
implications and the failed application of 
Prohibitions noble experiment. These 
arent contemporary number-crunchers 
with the lessons of history on their side  
Fisher and Warburton were writing at the 
nadir of some of the laws deepest priva
tions. In addition, their research has 
revealed that per capita consumption and 
the percentage of annual per capita income 
spent on alcohol was falling before the pas
sage of the 18th Amendment and that feder
al spending during Prohibition exceeded 
amounts devoted to controlling drinking 
before the ban itself was codified. Add to 
this amount local and state spending and 
you have a case of government activism so 
profligate that the benefits appear nominal

To the victor goes the spoils: UN useless to a postwar Iraq
S ,r> t/> . , \ \\ iI \!> ! 1 M1 >/' i a lil / ,
Ben Hackett
. On April 12, the G7 (the seven richest industrial nations in the 
^Vorld) decided to support a UN Security Council Resolution for 
a global effort to rebuild Iraq. Until then, the U.S. had been holdr'mg both firm and correct in their beliefs. France and Germany 
1  part of the G7  are two countries dead-set against the war,
I'5tit two countries demanding the UN lead in the reconstruction 
*"6vf Iraq. Even worse, France would have vetoed any U.S. and 
~ British Security Council Resolution authorizing the use of force 
in Iraq, but now they wish to be part of the group that shall over
see the reconstruction of Iraq. Sound suspicious? These coun
tries provided no support financially, militarily, or politically, 
c ^and even degraded the morale of the troops of the coalition of 
'fiie willing.
_ The United Nations invalidated itself to many when its mem
ber nations refused to act on a resolution in support of military 
action in Iraq, even after Saddams regime was twelve years in 
violation of disarmament and six months in material breach of 
!J Ufa Security Council Resolution 1441.
"France, Germany, and Russia all wish to be major players in 
postwar reconstruction of Iraq, but their cause is not benev
olent. They do not simply wish to aid in the soothing of humani
tarian issues in Iraq; they want to pry their way back into the 
game for pure economic reasons. The doubting countries are 
 .using the UN as a front to allow them back into the fray without 
^Having to offer an apology to the U.S.-led coalition for their 
attempted thwarting of the liberation of the Iraqi people. France, 
Germany, and Russia, with the UN as their figurehead institu
tion, are using a humanitarian guise to shield what is in fact an 
international feeding frenzy on the resources and opportunities 
within Iraq.
The only silver lining here is that the other countries could 
lessen the burden on the U.S. economy concerning the cost of 
rebuilding Iraq.
This is an organization that gives heed to terrorist regimes 
while troubling democratic governments looking to liberate for
eign peoples. All should be wary of the UN taking charge of an 
interim government in Iraq.
Those bearing the cost of war, both the financial losses and the 
loss of human lives, are the ones that now provide the people of 
Iraq with basic nutritional needs, medical supplies, and overall 
security.
France, a country that sold spare military parts to Iraq, and 
Russia, a country that provided Iraqi fighters with night-vision 
goggles, both demand a leading role in the reconstruction of 
.Iraq. Everyone fears that the U.S. will gain economically from 
this war, and it will. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong

with foreign policy being in the best interests of the country 
instituting it. The wonderful part about the potential economic 
gain for the United States is that in the process they will be help
ing the Iraqi people. The United States, unlike Saddam Hussein, 
will provide the Iraqi people with the revenue from oil exports. 
Instead of building palaces, the United States will build up the 
commercial, industrial, and social infrastructure of the potentially-great country of Iraq.
The United Nations should count its lucky stars that it is even 
being allowed any role in the reconstruction of Iraq. After six

months of trying to derail the U.S. effort to disarm and liberate 
Iraq, it once again has connived its way through an internation
al jostling for position into a partial lead in the Iraqi rebuilding 
effort. If it were up to me, the UN, who held back information 
about weapons, uranium, and mobile weapons labs, wouldnt 
even be allowed to cross the border into Iraq. Even through 
Syria.

Last weekend, students got into the spring spirit to celebrate Carnival. With all the 
'eat activits and exciting parties, we wanted to know:
Michael Croland
Superfluous spending is all around us  for 
an elegant pay toilet; for legislators driving 
state-provided SUVs; and for the military. 
When our bus system is going down the crapper, we must protect its foundation and ensure 
its survival. If public transit doesnt receive ade
quate state funding, CMU students and 
Pittsburgh residents will be devastated, 
v - Plans have yet to be finalized, but if state sup
port for public transit isnt salvaged, the bottom 
line is that Pittsburghers who depend on the Port 
Authority Transit (PAT) will get screwed. As 
Qrly as July 1, all bus and trolley service on 
weekends and holidays could be terminated, 
with no service on weekdays after 9 pm. The pra
ised rate hike would raise the basic fare from 
*T$i.75 to $2. Governor Rendells budget slashes 
 transit funding by a much-needed $16.1 million.
The imminent transit crisis this year is the 
Jatest disgrace in a recent trend of disregard for 
public transportation. If the rate hike goes 
through, this would be the third straight year in 
which rates were raised, with the basic fare up 
from $1.60 a year ago. Last year, all 24-hour 
service was terminated. The current proposed 
measures are the most drastic, though: the 
FY03-04 budget pushes subsidies for public 
transit to their lowest level in almost a decade.
Its basic knowledge that pooling people into 
public transportation averts traffic congestion 
that would be worse if every rider had a vehicle. 
In addition to preventing traffic problems, the 
same scenario also leads to less pollution. 
Furthermore, buses are safer than cars, and 
^bus-dependent commuters wind up using less 
oil, and with current crises abounding in the 
, Middle East, our oil supply could be in jeopardy. 
J ^Despite all the logic behind using buses and the 
"benefits that buses confer, the mere fact that 
many people cant economically or physicallyrnn

afford cars justifies public transits existence 
and service to the residents of Pittsburgh.
Quite simply, PAT buses are the primary and 
only sources of vehicular transportation for many 
CMU students. We rely on bus service to get to 
and from campus. Transportation to the airport, 
doctors, off-campus residences, jobs, shopping, 
and most forms of entertainment and fun in the 
city of Pittsburgh depend on the bus system.
Even for those who have other options, tak
ing the bus is often more convenient than trying 
to park a car. Avoiding a drunken car ride is 
invaluable beyond words.
Who else relies on the bus system? According 
to a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article published ear
lier this month, those who need a well-functioning bus system include: people who work week
ends or rotating shifts, students who attend 
night or weekend classes at local universities, the 
working poor, disabled, handicapped and aged, 
anyone who cant drive or doesnt own a car.
No one benefits, says Stephen Donahue, sec
retary of Save Our Transit (SOT), regarding the 
looming transit crisis. SOT formed in March
2002 to voice bus and trolley riders opposition 
to being so neglected and has fought commendably and arduously to literally save our transit.
As Donahue explains, the bus and trolley sys
tems we depend upon so heavily are a part of our 
culture. Nobody can rip that away from us with
out a good fight. While the group, in its public 
demonstrations and education campaign, has 
been met receptively by local government, the 
biggest task right now is at the state level.
SOT is leading a pilgrimage to the state 
capital of Harrisburg tomorrow to rally and 
complain to Rendell and state senators and 
representatives. Its our system! as 
Donahue passionately asserts, and SOT and 
others dependent on PAT need to make their 
voices heard.
While Donahue is personally optimistic that 
either a fare hike or service cutbacks, if not 
both, can still be averted, time is running out, 
and Rendell doesnt seem to be changing his 
mind. After playing by the book thus far, civil

If either a fare hike or service cutbacks are 
implemented, public hearings will be held to 
determine how the community can tackle these 
issues. To protect crucial routes, such as the 61

Pittsburgh, students and all of the general pub
lic are encouraged to attend these meetings and

damentals of the bus system. I like the idea of 
nice shelters, says Donahue, but the first 
thing we need is a system that operates.
Other wasteful endeavors include the $4 bil
lion Mon-Fayette Expressway that will link 
West Virginia to Pittsburgh and the annual $1.5 
million given to state legislators so they can 
drive SUVs, one person per car, to Harrisburg. 
This superfluous spending must be scrapped so 
long as we cant satisfy citizens basic needs, for 
which public transit is a high priority.

TRANSIT, from page A9
While there is no direct link between federal spending 
! and Pittsburghs transit problems, its an accepted clich 
;that as military spending increases, public services 
; decrease. President Bushs approximately-$80 billion war 
budget went through Congress last week, making it obvi ous that the money is indeed going somewhere. Whether 
'or not you support the war is irrelevant to realizing that 
;the issues most vital to Americans dont begin with an I 
-and end with a Q theyre the ones being neglected
 domestically.
CMU students and Pittsburghers absolutely need public 
transit to thrive. Its not too late to prevent devastating 
funding cutbacks.
Please call Governor Rendells office at (717) 787-2500 
and encourage an increase in the operating subsidy for 
public transit, explaining that PAT fare hikes and/or ser
vice cutbacks would be paralyzing. Please save our tran
sit.

' PROHIBITION, from page A8
when weighed against the excessive 
costs.
Alcohol actually became more dan
gerous to drink. Bathtub gin and 
other homemade nostrums substitut
ed for beer or European wine. These 
types of drinks contained dizzying 
amounts of alcohol per volume, but 
were easy to make and distribute, 
resulting in a sustained popularity 
throughout Prohibition. Social scien
tists likewise targeted alcohol for its 
ties to criminal activity. Here they 
may have been onto something. It is 
folly to think that alcohol and crime 
are unrelated, but it is equally foolish, 
however, to ascribe direct causation 
to a substance simply because it has 
statistical ties to bad behavior. 
Seventy years after the end of 
Prohibition, though, this blighted 
thinking continues. Today, organiza
tions like Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving have turned their focus from 
drunk driving to drinking and dri
ving according to Radley Balko, a
freelance writer and the mouth 
behind the website TheAgitator.com.
MADD has trimmed their sails in 
the past few years in order to further 
reduce blood-alcohol content (BAC) 
limits nationwide to their current lev
els of-about .08 percent. As a public 
health issue, drunk driving cannot be 
dismissed, but a more recent analysis 
of MADD shows it has combined 
efforts with local law enforcement 
authorities at random roadblock 
checkpoints to arrest motorists with 
BACs as low as .01  put a different 
way, anyone who had a glass of wine 
with dinner is now. a potential felon. 
MADDs claim of 17,000 deaths a year 
from drunk driving-related accidents 
also falls flat when confronted with 
more realistic numbers. The Los 
Angeles Times ran a story in the past 
year placing the number closer to 
5,000 deaths a year, a high count 
indeed, but a far cry from the 
avalanche originally claimed by 
MADD. In addition, most of these 
deaths have come as a result of dri
vers with blood-alcohol levels at .14
percent or above. One has to wonder, 
then, that the guilty may be recidivist 
alcoholics who would not respond to 
significant public pressure anyway, 
let alone new legislation.
Prohibitions failure is our own, 
ultimately. Imperfect laws come from 
imperfect men and women who seek 
to save others through blindly puni
tive means. Unfortunately, the 
humanitarian with the guillotine is 
still among us. In anti-vice collectives 
and drug war advocates, the ghost of 
Anthony Comstock lingers on. Our 
current lawmakers would do well to 
listen to George Santayana and learn 
the lessons of history before we are 
doomed to repeat them. On Beers 
Day or any other, Id drink to that. .

US ice-cold on draft bill, forced service
DRAFT, from page A8
thinks that if the decision-makers have their kids 
on the front lines, they will more accurately weigh 
the costs of any war. This assumes that politicians 
dont care about the lives of their constituents in 
the military; such a ridiculous argument is dis
proved by the fact that we have people without 
death wishes volunteering to serve. Nevertheless, it 
is better for the politicians not to be so personally 
affected by a military action; this will keep them 
objective and able to make tough decisions.
Do we want a government who hesitates to fight 
a necessary war because they worry about their 
children? They have enough concerns as it is.
Finally, draft proponents caution that conditions 
may all but force the economically disadvantaged 
to enlist when they wouldnt otherwise. However, 
in this regard, the military is offering those same 
economically-disadvantaged individuals, as well as 
society in general, a prime opportunity and an 
indispensable service. If a youth chooses enlist
ment, he will receive free job training and unparal
leled educational opportunities.
People coming out of military service are much 
more of an asset to themselves and their country 
than they were when they went in; why not 
improve the skills and educational level of those 
who see military service as their best option any
way?
Rangel and friends have the nations best inter
ests at heart, but a military draft will hurt the 
morale and skill of the armed forces and will place 
an unfair economic burden on those serving, all in 
the name of remedying a problem that doesnt 
exist.
Allowing constituents to volunteer helps every
one; the fact that the demographic spread of the 
rest of the nation also shows up in the armed forces 
means that the military machine is working fine. It 
certainly doesnt need a complete overhaul.

14 April 2003 THE TARTAN Page Ais?
Leagues need 
to preserve, 
restore rules
byTh reddasdef
Sports nostalgia has waned over 
the last several decades. Teams find 
they may move on whims, players 
find the same, and rules changes are 
chaotic attempts to keep sports inter
esting to fans but not to nostalgists. 
To put it more bluntly, if I watch a 
baseball game where the pitcher has 
a designated hitter batting for him, I 
dont feel like Im watching baseball 
anymore.
Baseballs introduction of the des
ignated hitter position in the 
American League in 1973 eliminated 
the need for well-rounded pitchers, 
letting them focus on launching fastbreaking, fast-moving pitches and let
ting them ignore the fact that every 
other member of their team was 
required to play both offense and 
defense. Precisely one pitcher has 
been in the starting offensive line-up 
at an American League stadium in the 
last 30 years: Rick Rhoden of the New 
York Yankees, who got only one plate 
appearance in 1988 and hit a sac fly 
to knock a run in.
The designated hitter merely caus
es the separation between the hitting 
abilities of pitchers and other field 
players to widen; fixing pitchers 
inability to hit as well as other players 
by taking them out of the offensive 
lineup is like fixing certain quarter
backs inability to scramble by stop
ping any broken passing play to sub
stitute a running back to finish the 
play.
Just this year in football, a debate 
arose over how overtime should be 
treated. As a sports purist, I feel over
time should be eliminated in any 
sport which permits ties, except as 
necessary in the playoffs. When over
time was initiated in the NFL in 1974, 
ties were common and were ignored. 
If you tied a game, the league ignored 
any work you did for it and dropped it 
from the standings; if you tied all 14 
games, it was like you never had a 
season.
The rule that a tie  now a product 
only of a 75 minute game  is worth 
half a win andhalf a loss was not 
instituted until 1976. Had they 
thought of this before overtime, I 
expect that overtime would never 
have been needed to break ties which 
the league felt were bad to merely 
overlook.
But we have that rule now, and we 
have a major overtime controversy; 
why not rid ourselves of the extra 
period altogether? It could, as was 
witnessed following a rare SteelersFalcons tie this year, make postseason 
races more interesting. In most sea
sons in which there are no ties, there 
are 17 possible final standings for 
teams; with ties more frequent, this 
number jumps to 33, making what 
would be overtime losses valuable to 
teams in search of*a:i$light competi
tive advantage going into the play
offs.
The NFL is also suffering a realign
ment with which I couldnt be more 
displeased. The alignment glitch in 
1952, which put Dallas  eight years 
later  into the East, keeps on giving, 
with fans unwilling to give up clas
sic rivalries for the opportunities for 
some new ones.
Dallas remains in the East, despite 
being further South or West of almost 
every team in the conference. 
Indianapolis is in the South despite 
being south of practically no one. The 
realignment was mostly a success, 
keeping large portions of nearly every 
division intact, but doing so at the 
expense of not fixing some of the 
major errors. Miami is in the South; 
Baltimore is in the East; their teams 
are in the East and North divisions, 
respectively.
Rules changes in sports change the 
sports. Some fans want ever-more 
offense and scoring, while the basics 
of the game (hitting in baseball and 
hitting of a completely different type 
in football) fade into the background. 
Sports were invented as one sort of 
game, and only rules which improve 
the safety of the players or the ease of 
officiating are truly necessary. 
Eventually, it should be realized that 
errant rule changes hurt everyone, 
and that changing back is often like 
ripping off a bandage after its done 
its job: quick and only temporarily 
painful.
Hockey is looking to return to older 
rules as proposals to eliminate twoline passes are considered. When the 
sport was starting out professionally, 
there were no blue lines, and thus no 
two-line passes. Perhaps this example 
of how sports come full circle will 
inspire other sports purists to take the 
nations outdoor sports back to their 
roots.

James buys $10M 
policy before game
WASHINGTON (AP)  LeBron 
James will be covered by a $10 mil
lion insurance policy when he plays 
in next weeks Capital Classic high 
school all-star game.
The Capital Classic is scheduled for 
April 17 at the MCI Center.
James asked for the policy, which is 
similar to the one he had for the 
McDonalds All-American game in 
Cleveland last month.
I did not think the request was 
anything unusual, said Bob 
Geoghan, the Capital Classic execu
tive director on Thursday. If I was 
him, Id probably want the same 
thing. While the chances are slim that 
he would get a career-ending injury, 
its something to think about.
Geoghan said the event usually car
ries a $5 million policy for players 
and that it had cost in the thou
sands to add the extra insurance.
James, who played for St. VincentSt. Mary of Akron, Ohio, is expected 
to be the first player chosen in the 
NBA draft this summer, marking the 
start of a professional career that 
could net him tens of millions in 
salary and endorsements.
WNBA cancels pre
draft tryout camp
NEW YORK (AP)  Stalled con
tract negotiations caused the WNBA 
to cancel its predraft tryout camp 
Thursday, and next Wednesdays col
lege draft as well, as the leagues
2003 season may be in jeopardy.
The four-year contract between the 
league and its players association 
expired September 15, 2002, and 
talks for a new one began in 
November. On Tuesday, the NBA 
Board of Governors said it would can
cel the WNBA season if no deal is in 
place by April 18.
The leagues latest offer is a threepercent raise for veterans minimum 
salaries from $40,000 to $41,200 and 
a reduction in the minimum for rook
ies from $30,000 to $25,000. For the 
top four draft picks, the reduction 
would be from $55,000 to $40,000.
The union is asking for a minimum 
salary of $48,000 for veterans and 
$33,000 for rookies, with a salary cap 
of $750,000 per club, unrestricted 
free agency in the fifth year, and 
restricted free agency in the fourth 
year.
Iverson, ONeal will

COLORADO SPRINGS (AP)  
Allen Iverson and Jermaine ONeal

Thursday.
The decision was made in a confer

Basketball Selection Committee, said 
a basketball source with knowledge 
of the selections on condition of 
anonymity.
Asked about the Olympics on 
Thursday, Iverson said he hasnt 
received official word.

Forbes: Yankees are 
most valuable team
NEW YORK (AP)  The New York 
Yankees are by far the most valuable 
team in baseball, worth more than 
twice as much as 26 of the other 29 
clubs, according to a study by Forbes 
Magazine.
In a story for its April 28 edition. 
Forbes estimated the worth of the 
Yankees at $849 million  $351 mil
lion more than the next-most-valu
able team, the New York Mets ($498 
million).
The Boston Red Sox were third at 
$488 million, followed by the Los 
Angeles Dodgers ($449 million) and 
the Atlanta Braves ($423 million). 
According to Forbes, the most prof
itable team in baseball last year was 
the Seattle Mariners, who made 
$23.3 million. The Yankees were next 
at $16.1 million, followed by the San 
Francisco Giants ($13.9 million), the 
Baltimore Orioles ($12.4 million), 
the Chicago Cubs ($11.9 million), 
and the Mets ($11.6 million). The 
Dodgers were the biggest losers, with 
an operating deficit of $25 million.

Track teams sweep competition in joint meet
Throwing events were as important as always in the joint track meet against Grove City and Waynesburg on Wednesday. 
The teams placed high in shot put, discus, and hammer throws in taking the meet with 171 points.
The mens and womens track and 
field each took the top place in their 
joint meet against Grove City, 
Waynesburg, and the womens team 
from the University of PittsburghJohnstown. Duquesne and Robert 
Morris were also present, but did 
not participate in scoring. The 
Tartans posted a final score for the 
men of 171, 10 points ahead of 
Grove City, and 149 points for the 
women, 11 points ahead of PittJohnstown.
Weather was not nearly as much 
of a factor as it had been at the larg
er Western Pennsylvania Invitational, 
with the sun darting in and out of 
the clouds all afternoon. The track 
and the pits were dry, and the field 
events started the afternoon.
We had a fairly nice day to com
pete, said head coach Dario 
Donatelli. We produced some nice 
times.
Highlights of field events includ
ed top places in womens high jump 
and mens shot put. First-year Jillian 
Erickson took the high jump with a 
clearance of 1.53 meters, among the 
top scores in school history. Senior 
Bob Barton got first place in the shot 
put with his throw of 14.33 meters, 
more than 1.5 meters ahead of his 
closest competition. Carnegie 
Mellon also took three of the top 
five finishes in the mens javelin, 
including a second place throw of 
46.59 meters for J.T. Belknap. In the 
mens discus, Tartan throwers had 
four of the top five distances, includ
ing Scott Jubecks 41.20 meters.
Sophomore Matt Dalka also had the 
days top high jump of 1.83 meters. 
Both the mens and womens ham
mer throwers competed, but no 
other school put throwers into those 
events, giving guaranteed points 
toward Tartan victory.
In the running events, Carnegie 
Mellon finished with excellent times 
in the 1500-meter runs. For the 
women, senior Katie Aerni finished 
first with a time of 4:49.2, and 
sophomore Nicole Gartner placed 
second with a time only .3 seconds 
slower. Both of them posted two of 
the top five times in team history in
that event. Tartan women runners 
took seven of the top 10 places in the 
1500-meter run. For the men, firstyear Dana Irrer topped the field 
with a time of 4:03.6 in a race in 
which the top three runners were 
from Carnegie Mellon.
The long runs which ended the 
day showed Tartan dominance over 
the course; Aerni took the 3000- 
meter run after lapping some of her 
opponents with a 10:27.2 time, 
nearly a minute ahead of her nearest 
competition. Tartan runners also 
took third and fifth places in the 
3000-meter run. The CMU mens
team took the top four places in the 
5000-meter run, with Jared 
Markowitz, Mike Rossi, Nick End, 
and Matt Meurer finishing the race 
within 15 seconds of each other.
In the shorter runs, Dalka took 
both the 110-meter and 400-meter 
hurdles, and the mens A team 
took the 4 X 400-meter relay.
Looking forward to what 
Donatelli expects to be a more diffi
cult meet at Slippery Rock, the 
teams will face some of their hardest 
competition of the year.
It looks like our teams coming 
along nicely, said Dalka.

Vancouver Canucks
As the saying goes, offense wins 
games; defense wins champi
onships. Vancouver already found 
that out the hard way when 
Colorado slid by them for the 
Northwest Division crown, and, as it 
stands now, the Canucks dont have 
the defense or goaltending to get by 
the top three in the West.
St. Louis Blues
Chris Pronger may be back, but 
the Blues just havent matched up 
well with their competition. St. 
Louis went 1-2-1-0 against Dallas, 
Colorado, and Vancouver, and
0-4-0-1 against Detroit. That 
shouldnt make anyone in St. Louis 
feel very secure.
Minnesota Wild
The Wild play a tight defensive 
style that could frustrate a firstround opponent, but the talent gap 
between the top three and everyone 
else is just too large.
Anaheim Mighty Ducks
See the entry on the Minnesota 
Wild.
Edmonton Oilers
The Oilers have consistently 
pulled first-round upsets in recent 
years, but that was with Joseph in 
net. Having to dump salary and the 
corresponding talent makes it a 
tougher task as well.
Matt Brun (mbrun@) will be suffer
ing roughly 20 heart attacks every 
other day for as long as his Red Wings 
are still in the hunt, especially if they 
end up playing Colorado.
EWSS HIPA
As I alluded to in my byline last 
week, the NHL playoffs have begun, 
and Im taking it upon myself to do a 
prediction-free overview of each 
teams chances. As of this writing, 
one game has been played from 
each first round series, and the 
lower seed won all but one. Since 
that fact alone throws off most of 
my first-round picks, Ill focus on 
each team rather than each series.
Ottawa Senators
Historically, the Sens have been a 
regular season team that flames out 
early in the playoffs. The biggest 
problem facing Ottawa is in goal, 
where Patrick Lalime hasnt shown 
the flashes of brilliance needed to 
steal a big game. If he cant step it 
up, itll be another short post-season 
in Canadas capital.
New Jersey Devils
The only top-four seed to win 
their opening game, the Devils 
havent changed much of their cupwinning strategy from 95: let 
Martin Brodeur do his thing and 
score just enough to win. Arguably 
the strongest defensive team in the 
field, the Devils will be in a lot of 
one-goal games, but could have a 
hard time finding someone to score 
the game winner.
Tampa Bay Lightning
Like the Hurricanes last year, the 
Lightning snuck into a high seed by 
winning the weak Southeast 
Division. The Bulin Wall  goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin  could
New York Islanders
Even though they backed into the 
playoffs, the Islanders are an inter
esting dark horse candidate. This is 
the team that could pull a wild firstround upset, could make like 
Carolina last year and stun everyone 
on their way to the finals, or could 
just flame out altogether.
Dallas Stars
Dallas is thanking their lucky 
stars that Detroit couldnt wrap up 
the top seed in the West. As a result, 
the Stars can sit and watch Detroit 
and Colorado beat each other up in 
a probable second-round meeting 
and then take advantage of the sureto-be-exhausted survivor. Dallass 
incredible offensive-defensive bal
ance and team depth also make 
them a legitimate favorite.
Detroit Red Wings
The Wings have a lot to prove 
after sliding out of the top spot in 
the West. Detroit is looking to win 
their fourth cup in seven years with 
a fourth goaltender  Curtis Joseph
 who will get most of the blame if 
they fail. As mentioned above, the 
road to a repeat victory will be 
tough, but the Wings definitely have 
the talent to pull off another repeat.
Colorado Avalanche
The Avs have to be praying for a 
chance to avenge last years collapse 
against the Wings in the Western 
finals, but probably arent looking 
forward to playing Dallas after
wards. As long as this team has 
Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic, and 
Patrick Roy, they will always be a 
strong candidate to win it all.
carry them past division rival 
Washington in the first round, but 
they just dont have the talent to 
make a long run.
Philadelphia Flyers
Another routine underachiever in 
the post-season, the Flyers are defi
nitely threatening to make it out of 
the East. Reuniting Jeremy Roenick 
and Tony Amonte gives the Flyers a 
scoring threat only matched by 
Detroit and Colorado and makes 
them a strong contender.
Toronto Maple Leafs
The Flyers toughest challenge in 
the East could be their first-round 
opponent. Toronto has as much top 
flight talent as any team in the 
league, but they arent as deep as 
Dallas or Detroit. Goaltender Eddie 
Belfour has won a cup before, and 
beating a tough team like Philly 
early on could be a springboard to 
greatness.
Washington Capitals
The Caps are looking to win a 
playoff series for the first time since 
their run to the finals in 98, but 
wont get there unless Olaf Kolzig 
starts stopping pucks. Jaromir Jagr 
or Peter Bondra will have to start 
taking over games for this team to 
have a chance.
Boston Bruins
An early-season favorite, the 
Bruins started to stumble in 
November and never recovered. 
Goaltending by committee has 
never worked in the playoffs and 
has very little chance against New 
Jerseys discipline and consistency.

Get the party started:
Thursdays opening ceremonies kickstarted a great Carnival weekend
While Thursday afternoons approach brought some panic, it also gave builders a sense of relief: weeks of long 
nights and hard work would finally be over. Before the gates to Midway were opened at 5 pm, tension and some 
last-minute stress filled the air. Many organizations used their down-time to do some final touch-ups to their 
booths before opening them, and many of the most-anticipated booths were closed to the public at the very 
beginning of Carnival.
Even though most were prepared to celebrate another Carnival in the rain, the sun came out from behind a layer 
of clouds just in time. As everyone was finally allowed back into Midway, each organizations focus began to shift 
beyond their own booths into their competitors creations.
The bagpipers were first heard from a distance and soon seen progressing into the area. For the next three days, 
music never stopped at the parking lot. As the bagpipers concluded their Carnival contribution, the Kiltie Band 
performed a various and energetic collection of songs from their spring concert in the main tent. During the Kiltie 
Bands performance, the Buzz Poets were doing a sound check to get ready for their concert later in the evening.
In addition to members of various organizations, students of all interests converged on the area on Thursday to 
enjoy the start of their three-day weekend.
[Carnival] is fun because the whole campus is involved, and everyone puts a lot of work into it. Everything 
comes out really nice, said Olga Beschastnykh, a first-year economics major. Beschastnykh, a buggy driver for 
Phi Kappa Theta, was also looking forward to the weekends races.

CARNIVAL 
ALMANAC.
YEARS AGO
Mary Lou Rocks, a senior secretarial major, was 
crowned queen of Carnival. As queen, she not only 
reigned over Carnival celebrations, but also held the 
place of honor on the queen's float in the float 
parade. Highlights of the parade included ATOs 
Dumbo float, which portrayed the movies circus 
train. ATO placed first, while SigNu came in second 
with The Circus Parade, which featured many 
clowns and a papier-mache elephant.
25 YEARS AGO
SDC beat Carnivals 5:30 pm opening ceremony 
with a 70-foot banana split at 5, which was con
sumed by the crowd in less than fifteen minutes. In 
Buggy news, there were several alumni teams, a 
team whose pushers were all women, a moose
shaped buggy, and a mailroom cart. The mailroom 
cart was entered by the Campus Printing Office.
1 YEARS AGO
At Carnival 1993, The Silver Screen, DG placed 
third in the sorority booth competition, but were rated 
first in the Demented category by The Tartan for 
their Jaws booth. The booth had a replica of Jawss 
head coming out of the asphalt, with bloodstained 
teeth and a bloody mannequin in its mouth. The 
game? Tossing rings around the mannequins limbs.
5 YEARS AGO
SigEp and SDC sponsored a block party on 
Roselawn Terrace on Saturday of Carnival weekend. 
The party, which went all afternoon, drew about 
400 people. There were four local bands playing 
alternative rock and a barbeque at the party, which 
gave Roselawn residents the chance to host the 
campus community, something that did not happen 
very often, students said.
1 YEAR AGO
-  \ -The mobot course was officially conquered. In 
the preceding seven years, no undergraduate team 
had gotten past the finish line of the mobot track, 
but this time Barney made it. Named and 
designed after the TV personality, this mobot was 
created by junior electrical and computing engineer 
Anthony Rowe and Alok Ladsariya, a senior in com
puter science. The robot was purple, like the friend
ly dinosaur it was named after. The color, according 
to Rowe and Ladsariya, was for sex appeal."

The big push:
Friday brought rain, but Saturday saw them run
By Saturday morning - once the roads and participants were dry - teams took to 
the .88-mile course.
Sweepstakes committee does not have permission to close Schenley Drive and 
Frew Street on Sunday. Obtaining those permits would be necessary to postpone 
finals in case of rain-outs on either of the first two days, which happens fre
quently and has happened in both of the last two years.
Teams which spent nearly a year perfecting design, pushing, and driving strate
gies took the roll they had, though. Unfortunately for onlookers and commenta
tors, the preliminary round features few A/A matchups and subsequently indi
vidual heats have little competition with anything but the clock.
Times were slower this year, and the reason might be attributed to something not 
present during the race. The spectacular raceday weather was clearly not indica
tive of the snow-covered roads seen throughout the winter that closed the 
University on Presidents' Day, limited Buggy push practices, and likely slowed 
pushing and transitions integral to good race times, despite the warmer weather 
during rolls.
Another possibility lies in these organizations' better Midway booths this year, 
which showed that participation in these organizations may have shifted away 
from buggy design and practice.
The women's races held first had occasional surprises. In a race against SigNu A, 
Spirit B had the only chute spin-out of the day, and the PiKA A women's team was 
granted a reroll after their buggy swerved to avoid hitting the race's lead truck.
"It was a universal consensus of people in the truck that they deserved a reroll," 
said Alan Charness, former buggy design competition chairman and WRCT-fm
Danielle Sinclair of the PiKa A team helped her team to fourth place after a reroll.
Carnegie Mellon's finest took to the hills behind campus Saturday and allowed 
the student body to trade their rooms and offices and the clusters for a bit of 
fresh air. A beautiful Saturday morning developed with not a cloud in sight after 
Friday kicked off with torential rains.
Sweepstakes collapsed to one day of races after Friday's preliminaries were can
celled due to the wet course. Following Friday's off-day, no doubt filled with the 
usual Carnival activities, the runs were set to begin.
The Fringe men put two buggies in the top 10, with its A team finishing second.

lead-truck commentator.
In addition to the DNF for Spirit, Beta was disqualified for failing their drop test 
after posting what would have been the best course time for the women's divi
sion of Buggy this year with 2:41.07.
The brakes stopped for the first part of the test, released, and then did not 
engage in time to pass the critical test, which ensures the safety of the driver dur
ing the event. The disqualification lost the race, to the dismay of Beta members 
present atop the hill, as Beta would have been the time to beat for the remainder 
of the morning's women's races
KDR C was a no-show for unknown reasons at the starting line for their heat and 
was generously granted a reroll by Sweepstakes'judges, during which they timed 
at the low end of the spectrum, though respectable for a C squad.
It is questionable whether this second opportunity was deserved, as every other 
buggy was in place on time for their heats. PiKA's reroll, the last race of the day 
for the women, was good enough for fourth place at 2:45.88.
Fringe showed their strength in design and pushing, taking two of the top five 
finishes, including their 2:44.81 A-team victory in one of the few new buggies of 
note named Insite. Fringe head mechanic Sam Swift refused to comment on how 
their latest entry was constructed.
Close behind the Fringe A buggy were SigNu A, only 0.70 seconds away, SDC A, 
away by 0.82 seconds, and PiKA A. Fringe's B team finished in fifth place nearly
20 seconds faster than any other B team on the course.
Premier teams PiKA and Fringe, the usual suspects for the winners of the men's 
buggy competition, had their races at the end of the raceday schedule for the 
men's races, while earlier races saw fast times from potential upsets SDC A and 
Beta A.

Beta B pusher interfered with a Spirit B buggy. Beta's second disqualification of 
the day came as a surprise to Beta members and fans, who were again upset that 
their time of 2:25.00 did not stand.
"In that race [Beta and Spirit], the pusher drifted off to the left, right in front of 
the Spirit pusher," said Charness.
Other problems on the course occured as the SAE buggy - their only entry in the 
races - hit a pothole and a wheel was dislodged. As it was unintentional, the 
team was not disqualified for loss of mass, but the team did place last due to the 
injured vehicle.
Otherwise, the rolls were clean and the.times were fast, though average time did 
fall from the last several years, which were among the fastest on record. Not a 
single team for the men spun out in the chute, an unusual feat for Carnival 
Sweepstakes competitions.
Fans crowded the course, and CMU Police were frequently required to clear the 
lanes of wandering fans, who seemed eager to be part of the action on hills two 
and five on either side of the finish line.

Several of the fans, many of whom were under
age, were cited by the Police for possession of 
alcohol, which is illegal for anyone in the area 
immediately adjacent to the course.
Beta onlookers in front of the Gym were cited for 
having two large packs filled with beer.

must start the buggy from a standing position.

Busty booths:
A great moment in carnival history.
Teams this year proved there are a lot of ways to brick a booth, but that there is 
no glory without the guts. Luckily for Carnival-goers, Midway had plenty of 
both, anchored firmly in Delta Upsilons fantastic tribute to the birth of the 
assembly line.
Because of attention to details, DUs booth shouted its dominance over Midway 
during the day. At night though, amidst a dark and abandoned Midway, DUs 
booth was at its best, with shadows complimenting the stark realness of the 
booth.
DU grabbed first prize again in the 
fraternity category this year with a 
booth that seemed like it must be 
built of oak and iron, and that would 
have easily conquered booths from 
all categories.
From 20 feet away, DUs two-story 
looked like an artifact pulled from 
the early 1900s, with wooden beams 
cut and painted to resemble rusty 
iron beams. The sooty gray beams 
with artfully painted rust made the 
booth unbelievably realistic, such 
that it almost takes a touch to con
vince yourself that the boot is in fact 
made of wood.
Beyond just the pure amount of cash 
and effort that went into the booth, 
DUs crew showed an attention to 
detail where many of their compatri
ots were caught blind-sided by a year 
of amazing booths
Jeff Horn, a sophomore art major and 
Delta Upsilon brother, said its always 
a rush to the last minute, despite 
booth help from almost every brother 
in the fraternity.
This years rush job, though, was 
completely decked out with a steady 
black metal interior (grating like a 
factory and get a load of the car) and 
enough spare time left over to paint 
the walls to look like the elements 
have bared the brick superstructure 
of the old factory.
We finished to our satisfaction, said 
Horn.
One of the many brick users during 
Carnival, DU laid stucco on the exte
rior of their booth, and used more 
stucco to simulate bricks and grout, 
another aspect of the booth that 
needed more than eyes for confirma
tion of materials.
Delta Upsilon stole the show and first place among fraternities with The Birth of the Assembly Line.

---------------------------------------------------

Two Kappa Kappa Gammas take a break on the steps of their booth, Fantasia.Sigma Tau Rho provided an intimate Asian ambiance with Forbidden City.
Kappa Delta Rho also used bricks on their booth, but unlike DU, they did not set
tle for clever deception.
Brick looks better, said Ashish Jain, a KDR brother and senior business major. 
It was worth it, he said. Everyone was like, holy shit, its real brick.
Jain said the most time-consuming part of the 2000 brick process was building 
the tower of the structure, since bricks had to be cut to align properly on the cor
ners. On the rest of the booth, KDR was able to just slap up brick faces, merely 
taking care to align every other row of bricks in normal fashion. But for the 
tower, for each corner 
brick, two bricks had to 
be sawed at 45-degree 
angles to align with 
each other.
KDRs booth chair Tom 
Broughan, a fifth year 
triple major in comput
er science, business, 
and economics, said 
that the interior ended 
up being a little sparse, 
and Jain agreed.
I wish we could have 
worked on the interior 
more, our exterior was 
awesome, said Jain.
The judges seemed to 
have felt the same way, 
passing KDR over for 
the three top spots 
among the male 
Greeks.
Phi Kappa Theta and 
Sigma Epsilon took sec
ond and third with 
Ancient Greece and 
Escape from Alcatraz 
as their respective 
motifs.
The independent cate
gory proved to be something of an upset, with the two-time defending champi
on Asian Student Association going the way of the Dodo bird in style. This year, 
ASA set their sights on a second story, and didnt quite fill it up.
Carrie Yu, ASA booth co-chair and a sophomore business administration student

Robots and rodents:
A rat and spider-legged robot make mobot history
Despite Fridays rain cancellation of buggy sweepstakes, the annual mobot com
petition takes place rain or shine. A light drizzle near the end motivated some 
participants to cover their vehicles with bags, but the rain for the most part was 
not a hindrance. This years competition had several unusual entries, including 
a legged vehicle and a rat.
Mobot, which stands for MObile roBOT, is held each year during Spring 
Carnival on the 212-foot course in front of Wean Hall. The competition offers 
generous prize money, with $1,000 going to the first-place winner. The prize 
money is provided by the competitions sponsors, Lockheed Martin Corporation 
and Harris Corporation.
This years competition had 12 entries, with six using the CMUcam system, five 
using traditional infrared sensors, and one using biological sensors (the rat). 
The CMUcam system is an inexpensive vision system developed at CMU. It uti
lizes a standard camera, handles image processing tasks to pick out the course 
line and can do color tracking.
Sebastian Scherer, a junior in computer science, won the undergraduate compe
tition by reaching gate 11 in three minutes and 23 seconds. His team name was 
Kuhman. This was not Scherers first success in mobot  he proved himself 
when he won the Open Class competition in 2001. Scherer also won this years 
$99 Mini-Challenge, which was held on April 2 as a preparation for the actual 
mobot competition.
Scherers vehicle this year used two wheel encoders, a mercury switch, and a
gate sensor. The gate sensor was a wooden stick which stuck off the side of the 
car and was triggered any time it hit the metal bar of a gate. By determining how 
many gates had been passed, the car could have more information for choosing 
a path through the decision point section of the course.
The decision points are at the end of the course where the white line splits sev
eral times and has the appearance of a circular pattern. The vehicles need to correcdy decide whether to go left or right at each branch.
Scherers car also determined when it was at the decision points by keeping track 
of total distance traveled and whether it had gone down the two hills on the 
course yet.
The car used a JStamp microprocessor board, which runs Java. Its really fun to 
program, said Scherer, who liked being able to program the car using the 
object-oriented Java syntax.
The Open Class competition, which is open to anyone associated with the uni
versity, was won by team Jimmy: Alok Ladsariya, a masters student in computer 
science, and Anthony Rowe, a senior in electrical and computer engineering.
Ladsariya and Rowe also won the undergraduate competition in 2002 and 2001. 
Last year, they delivered an impressive performance in which they completed 
the entire course for the first time in undergraduate history.
This year they designed a new car that used CMUcam2, which is the successor to
The MOBOT course was hit with some rain this year, but it wasnt enough to stop this year's contestants from performing. Twelve teams entered the 
_____________________________________________competition, with the undergraduate teams competing for prizes ranging from $250 to $1000.

---------------------------------------------------

Warren Saunders, a CMU graduate, entered the MOBOT competition with a rat named Pavlov. The rat stayed on the line briefly, but had a tendency to wander off to 
explore the dirt and grass. Saunders trained the rodent with rewards of tuna fish. It was the first time a rat had been trained to follow the MOBOT course line.
the CMUcam vision system. CMUcam2 has a higher resolution and can do 
motion tracking using frame differencing. The new system is not yet available, 
but should become available within the next several months, according to 
Ladsariya.
Their car was the fastest to ever navigate a significant portion of the mobot 
course. They reached gate 8 in 36 seconds. Ladsariya and Rowe explained that 
the improved capabilities of CMUcam2 helped them to achieve this high speed.
There was no third-place finisher because teams are required to pass the second 
gate in order to receive prize money. The Pikachu team came the closest, pass
ing the first gate in 29 seconds.

A combination of higher frame rate and higher resolution lets us look out fur
ther, said Ladsariya. The camera took images at 52 frames per second, a very 
large increase over the original CMUcam, which takes images at 17 frames per 
second.
Warren Saunders, a CMU graduate who competed in the Open division under 
the team name John Henry Project, had the most unusual mobot by far. His 
mobot was a rat named Pavlov. According to competition rules, animals (except 
primates) may be used to assist with vehicle control as long as such use is 
humane. Saunders rat created a great deal of interest  it was the first time an 
animal has competed on the mobot course.
Unfortunately, Pavlov the rat was easily distracted. She quickly wandered off the 
line to inspect more interesting things, like sticks, dirt, and candy wrappers. 
Pavlov was also probably not used to being near large crowds of people. 
Saunders trained the rat prior to the competition by rewarding her with pieces 
of tuna fish when she moved along the line far enough. Saunders said he trained 
the animal in sessions of no longer than two hours because it would get tired or 
bored after a while. A more intelligent animal, such as a dog small enough to fit 
through the course gates, would be easier to train, he said. He chose a rat this 
year because of the expense and difficulty of keeping a dog in an apartment. 
Saunders won the competitions Judges Choice award.
A team named Hex developed a legged mobot  the vehicle, which looked 
roughly like a giant spider, walked on six legs. Hex was the first official legged 
entry in mobot history. According to the team members, the vehicle moved by 
pivoting around a single foot when it turned. The team redesigned their vehicle 
several times because initial attempts didnt work well.
The second-place finisher in the undergraduate category was team Runaway. 
They passed the third gate in three minutes and 22 seconds. Their car was very 
slow. Team member James Chan Lianghong, a first-year in electrical and com
puter engineering, said that at higher speeds their car had problems with slip
ping on the course downslopes.
_
Team Hex used a very unique MOBOT design - the vehicle had six legs, and turned 
by using a caterpillar walk algorithm. On this run, the vehicle hit a course gate.

Fairy tale performance:
Into The Woods takes a clever spin on old classics
The choreography was effective and the dances were executed cleanly. This 
competence carried over to other elements of the play, as all of the actors and 
available props were used to their best ability. An example of this is the clever 
way the wolf swallowed Red Riding Hood and she ended up beneath the bed 
in which he was lying. When the Baker cuts the wolf open, she climbs up 
through a space in the bed, making it appear as if she is coming out of the wolfs 
stomach.
Sound was not a weak point in this production as it is so often in musicals. There 
was almost no trouble at all hearing the actors, and there was a nice range of sound 
effects. Cinderellas helpful birds squawked rather obnoxiously, but what can you 
expect of pure white doves that do their bit to help by furiously pecking out peoples 
eyes? Lighting was somewhat shaky at times, but during the song Second 
Midnight in the second act, the spotlight was used to great effect as the actors 
argued back and forth about whose fault it was that there was a giant on the loose.
The play gets a little preachy at the end, but other than that, the morals that it 
imparts are valuable and are lightened up by conclusions such as those the 
Bakers Wife makes after she sings a lecture on small deceptions being accept
able: If the end is right, it justifies the beans!
There were many fine moments in this production of Into the Woods. It was wellcrafted and well-directed, and it was obvious that much effort was lavished upon it.
Ill definitely be taking a little break after this, said Atkinson. Its a trade-off. 
You have an incredible experience and the people are wonderful, but with a big 
show like this, the other areas of your life suffer. Still, he is looking forward to 
directing again someday.
Annalisa Schaefer, Copy Staff 
Editors Note: Adam Atkinson used to work as a staffwriter on The Tartan.
Jack of beanstalk fame (Schrader), lovingly strokes his hippopotmus-like cow, as 
he deliberates trading his beloved pet for magic beans.
Director Adam Atkinson was correct when he said of his experience working on 
Into the Woods that there were so many wonderful moments.
Into the Woods is a musical that takes the characters from the familiar fairy tales 
of Cinderella, Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, and Jack and the Beanstalk and 
throws them into new situations together. The result is hilarious one-liners mixed 
with the messages the characters have to share as they venture into the forest.
The characters were well-portrayed, and relationships set out by the original 
tales were nicely expanded. When Red Riding Hood, played by Alexandra 
Orgera, encountered the Wolf (Brookes Decker) and he attempted to lead her 
from her path, the dance they did was more seductive than one might have 
expected. In the case of Rapunzel (Nicole Kaplan), the Witch who kept her 
imprisoned was not portrayed as a jailer so much as she was a mother figure to 
Rapunzel. When the long-haired belle left with her Prince, played by Matthew 
Acocella, the Witch begged her to stay, worrying that Rapunzel was leaving 
because her mother was old and ugly.
Sharin Apostolou as the Witch was one of the strongest singers in the company, 
along with Monica Thakkar as Cinderella. The rest of the cast all performed well 
together, both singing and dancing lengthy numbers with finesse, but soloists 
were also able to take command of the stage on their own. Sometimes, this was 
unexpected; after Tyler Ruebensaals Jack (of beanstalk fame) spent much of 
the play being the village idiot, he came out with an ambitious, exciting rendi
tion of Giants in the Sky. Jacks cow was as amusing as its master, as it resem
bled a hippopotamus.
The set was simple in its style but fairly complex in terms of the actual pieces 
involved: there were about ten tall pine trees for the forest, three different flats 
representing characters houses, and a steep tower for Rapunzel. There were 
platforms at various heights in the back to add some variation to the landscape 
and to allow the actors to use the space more effectively. At one point, a 
beanstalk was unfurled and thrust into the air.

Sleepless in Pittsburgh:
An Insomniac stays up late to entertain CMU
Comedian Dave Attell performed under the bright lights of the Midway tent for 
Carnivals opening night Thursday. The raucous hour-and-a-half show featured 
hilarious punch lines, scathing sarcasm, and a few overzealous (over-intoxicat
ed?) fans. Pillbox caught up with Dave after his set and asked the star of Comedy 
Centrals Insomniac a few questions about show business, booze, and waking up 
to Montel Williams.
PB: Have you been to Pittsburgh before?
DA: Ive been here before, doing just stand-up comedy stuff. But I like this town. 
Its a fun town.
PB: Would you ever consider doing an Insomniac in Pittsburgh?
DA: You know, Ive pitched this city to Comedy Central twice, and the process is 
basically if we can find enough stuff to do.... You know, even though this is such 
a super-cool college party town, colleges never let us on campus to shoot. 
Because, you know, nobody wants to see their kid having fun.
PB: Who were some of your biggest influences comedically, growing up?
DA: I guess I liked Richard Pryor and George Carlin growing up. Then, as I start
ed doing comedy it was guys like Bill Hicks, Sam Kinnison, Dom Irrera, Richard 
Genny, people like that. These people kind of showed me what its about. Theres 
so many good comics out there I couldnt name them all.
PB: When you get hecklers, is it tough or do you just try and work with it?
DA: I tell you, thats an interesting question, because theres hecklers and then 
theres hecklers. A guy screaming out, You rock! or Youre great, it disrupts the 
show, but its funny. And its outdoors, I mean, come on, its like a fucking state 
fair. I thought I was gonna be judging like blueberry pies up there or playing 
horseshoes. No, that was fun. Before I had the TV show, hecklers were people 
like You suck and Im gonna fight you in the parking lot and running onstage 
and trying to take you out. Thats heckling. These [Thursdays hecklers] are just 
guys who are, you know, into it  drunks. And I cant put down any other drunk 
because Im a drunk.
PB: I had heard through a few interviews 
that you actually have insomnia. What are 
some things that you do to deal with it?
DA: Well, I used to do Nyquil, but that of 
course destroys the liver. No, I think drink
ing really puts me out early. I think if I 
drink half a bottle of vodka, I usually get to 
sleep around 2 am and Im fresh the next 
day. I mean, I dont drink every night. I 
drink hard but I dont wake up in the morn
ing craving booze. I try to keep it under 
control, which is what we should all do. I 
feel like Im kind of living everyones 
dream. I hated getting up early for regular 
jobs when I had them and now I get to 
fucking stay up all night and sleep during 
the day. The only bad thing about being an 
insomniac is this: you get up in the middle
of the day to bad TV, soap operas and like Montel Williams. I dont wake up to 
Kathy Lee and whoever; I get up to somebody screaming That aint my baby! 
Thats the only bad thing about it.
PB: Has being famous and popular helped you any with the ladies?
DA: Im still looking for that special drunk. Not really, because as you can see its 
mostly guys, frat guys. And of course being a man of the cloth I try to stay away 
from that. It [Insomniac] was not supposed to be a drinking show, but it kind of 
turned into that. And I guess it shows you how lame our society is, where a guy 
is just drinking and smoking, two things that are legal in this country.... Its not 
like Im smoking crack and banging a fifteen year-old girl  its not like the R. 
Kelly show. Im just up there drinking and smoking, and people are like Whoa, 
what the fuck? So, it doesnt really help me. I rub em out with the best of them.
PB: Youre from Long Island, New York originally. Does any place youve been in 
the process of doing the show compare to New York, or do you still consider it 
the best?
DA: I tell you, for me personally, New York has become suburbanized to the point 
where you cant drink, they have noise complaints there, [and] you cant smoke 
inside. Its not as much fun as when I was younger, in my twenties. Youd go out 
at night and youd wonder, Am I gonna get fucked up? Is someone gonna kill 
me? Is there a serial killer out? There was excitement to the town. Now its kind 
of like anywhere else, its sad. Its really expensive; theres terror alerts all the 
time; and its very hard to shoot the show there.
i
PB: Whats been the high point of Insomniac since you started doing it?
DA: Well, the most fun stuff for me has been the jobs. Heres some jobs that have 
been cool: the inseminating of the cow with the dairy farmer ... shooting the 
nutrias in New Orleans, going to the sewage-treatment plant. That stuff is kind 
of cool. We always talk about it afterwards, me and the producers. You dont 
know that kind of shit goes on.
PB: How long would you like the show to continue for?
DA: Well, right now we just finished that 
fortieth show, and were kind of waiting to 
see what goes on. The show [got] harder 
to do the more popular it got. And Im not 
bitching and moaning about [that], 
because its great that people like the 
show but now when we go to a town peo
ple in the bars kind of go crazy. It became, 
you know, kind of a Fear Factor thing 
more than anything else sometimes. Im 
happy with what weve done, and if it 
keeps going thats cool, but like I said, Im 
a stand-up comic, and Ill keep doing that. 
And coming here, to a school, especially a 
smart school, is kind of a treat because 
Ive been doing colleges for years and its 
good to be at one where theres no, you 
know, degree in trucking.

My Giant:
The off-beat idols bravely defied bad weather to rock the house
Last Friday night, despite blustery weather, They Might Be Giants (TMBG) 
brought their unique musical talents to the Carnegie Mellon campus to play for 
an enthusiastic crowd. John Linnell, John Flansburgh, and their band of Dans
 Dan Miller (guitar), Dan Hickey (drums), and Dan Weinkauf (bass)  kicked 
off Carnival weekend in proper party fashion, even though the echoing Wiegand 
Gym in the University Center was a less-than-ideal venue.
I have to be very frank with you: this gym that were playing in today is proba
bly one of the worst [places], acoustically, weve ever played in, said Linnell in 
an interview before the show. The gym is not anybodys idea of a good gig ... 
but I have nothing against the school.
During the performance, which was sponsored by AB, Flansburgh volunteered 
his own opinion of the shittiest acoustics ever: The good part about this is that 
when the freshmen come in next year, they'll still be able to hear a little bit of the 
show were playing tonight.
Nevertheless, the mob responded favorably, and there were even a few crowdsurfers among the sea of dancing bodies by the end of the evening. After an 
encore, which included Robot Parade, a song about an army of futuristic 
robots from their childrens album No!, the audience seemed satisfied.
After over twenty successful years of music-making, Linnell says theres still no 
end in sight for TMBG.
We left our major label over six years ago, and were still doing really well. 
Were happy, said Linnell.
Linnell demonstrates his trademark accordion skills during Dr. Worm.
Having just released two compilations of rarities from their Dial-A-Song phone 
service, the Johns are currently working on new songs, as well as a childrens 
book for Simon and Schuster. Though theyre currently reaching out to a 
younger fan base, Friday nights performance was testament to their continued 
popularity with the college crowd. Bad weather was no match for good music.
L. Quinn Arroyo, Pillbox Editor
ysevtcsAl Pa dnetA wkk.l
Despite being herded into the congested basketball court, the audience was recep
tive from the moment the band opened with Istanbul (Not Constantinople). Most 
college kids dont remember when Istanbul first 
charted under the Four Lads in the 1950s, but their 
cheers of recognition signal that they probably remem
ber when TMBGs version appeared in an episode of 
Steven Spielbergs Tiny Toon Adventures. The enthusiasm 
carried over not only to TMBG original favorites like 
Particle Man and the college-radio blockbuster Ana 
Ng, but also to newer and less-often-performed mate
rial  treats for the die-hard fans  like Destination 
Moon and James K. Polk.
In comparison to other TMBG performances, like 
their past shows at Laga and other non-college ven
ues, this one seemed particularly suited to the lively 
Carnival audience. Flansburgh recognized early on 
that some concertgoers were inebriated.
Its been said that E major is the peoples key, and we Linnell took time Out
Flansburghs buoyant personality was well-suited to the happy crowd.
believe that A major is the drunk peoples key. If thats 
true, then A minor must be ... the angry drunk peo
ples key, he said, before belting out a number from 
their 2001 release Mink Car, the rousing and aptlytided drinking song, Drink!
The set also included TMBGs short series of 20 mini
songs, Fingertips, from 1992s Apollo 18. Each song 
lasts no more than 15 seconds, and played in rapid 
succession, the effect is impressive.
It was the hardest thing we ever had to learn, said 
Linnell. We had to cook up a way of playing it, 
because when we recorded it, we spent a lot of time 
... carefully putting things together. We never considered that wed have to play it [live], but we had a lot to Chat before the show. pe0p}e nagging us to do that, so we finally caved
in.... I think the record is better.... We cant quite 
achieve the full schizophrenia of the record when were doing it live.

Jurassic Rock:
The hip-hop act overcame all odds to deliver a stellar show
ysevtcsAl 14 dnetA 2003.
The highly anticipated Jurassic 5 concert was set up 
to be a dud. On a sunny, clear day, the concert was 
held indoors. The show, scheduled to begin at 3 pm, 
started an hour late. And the opening acts were 
stymied by poor sound quality and a sedate crowd 
that looked like the thrills of Carnival revelry had 
extracted too much of its energy.
But amongst the dolts squatting on the floor and the 
bystanders wondering if the concert would end by 6 
pm so they could get to the Midway awards ceremo
ny, there were the hip-hop aficionados who faithful
ly swung their extended right arms in the air. And J5 
answered their fan base with a tight, error-free per
formance.
J5 opened with I Am Somebody, a dance tune that 
livened up a crowd yearning for a bit of excitement. 
Hands went in the air and the crowd dutifully 
answered the call, Who are you?
Somebody.
But during that song and several others, the audi
ence emitted a powerful odor that I liken to putting a 
Wean cluster in the dance room of a fraternity house. 
When J5 member Marc7 asked the crowd to throw 
their hands up to do some phys ed exercises, the 
audience moaned.
It was difficult to discern a flow to the song selection. 
It alternated between heavy bass and lightweight 
tunes and never built into a crescendo. I expected
not just a live playing of some greatest hits album, 
but a concert, a performance like, the one on Power 
in Numbers. Theres a story line to their latest album; 
youre not hearing separate songs bound together by 
the artists voice or songs that have some hollow, 
comparable sound. Power in Numbers is a musical 
score with a message, rhyme solos, Mametspeak dia
logue, and good DJ mixing. The visceral DJ Cut 
Chemist stole the show with his guitar solo. With 
his back to the audience, the DJ strapped on a 
portable turntable and began spinning like Jimi 
Hendrix on an electric guitar.
Cut Chemist and J5 know rhythm. But on stage, 
thats harder to achieve when three or four of the J5 
mates are just bouncing to the beat waiting for their 
turn on the mic. At too many shows, a band just plays 
its song list live, inspiration optional. J5 no doubt 
engaged the audience on Saturday and had some 
stage play between its members. Chali 2na, wearing 
a vintage Cubs jersey and a smile that should be on a 
toothpaste commercial, had the audience eating out 
of the palm of his hand. Live, his sonorous voice is 
friendly and quizzically comforting.
J5 had that old school hip-hop sound working well 
during Concrete Schoolyard from their EP album 
(1997). The group showed why they are one of the 
freshest acts in hip-hop music when they started 
tooting the melody on their kazoos.
Its this creativity and a poppy sound that should make 
Power in Numbers an appealing album to the main
stream. Its a meaningful alternative to the high-class 
thuggery of 50 Cent and other boozin, gang-bangin, 
and glock-poppin singsong artists. J5s melodic rhymes 
punch the political hot buttons like race relations, just 
like Public Enemy and old school groups. During the 
concert, J5 had a political message for an agreeable 
audience: Fuck this war. Fuck the President.
The only song that wasnt flawless was What's 
Golden. The chorus was off pitch and the sound 
mixing was chaotic. The song did have a great vibrat
ing bass, something that could have been done more 
often given that the concert was indoors.
The show had to be held inside the acoustically 
dreadful UC Gym, according to Matt Meurer, AB 
Concerts chair. Weather forecasters had predicted 
wind gusts between 10-15 miles per hour for 
Saturday. J5s managers told Meurer that the heavy 
wind could damage the sensitivity of the turntables.
Because the show was indoors, the lighting was use
less. There were no blinds to block the skylights and 
even the ceiling lights were left on. Crowd members 
who had attended OMs Holi Festival before the 
show added more color to the concert than the stage 
lighting. Despite the drab setting, J5 was able to rile 
up the crowd. Where lesser bands would have failed, 
the most creative hip-hop group in the country 
showed why AB picked an up-and-comer for the big 
Saturday show.

---------------------------------------------------

The crowd was a combination of mixed nuts last Saturday when students and 
alumni filled the University Center gym for an afternoon of hip-hop at the Spring 
Carnival concert which featured Jurassic 5. After waiting many hours for wrist
bands and entrance into the venue, the audience was greeted by the soulful beats 
and rhymes of a group called Little Egypt, of whom many had not heard. This 
group of four dynamic young men did not mind; rather, they preferred it that way.
We always find ourselves in non-traditional hip-hop crowds, said Joe Steele, 
a.k.a. Visual Poetics. But we enjoy that because we are introducing hip-hop and 
ourselves to these people.
After a short introduction by Visual Poetics with smooth beats in the background, 
they quickly segued into full conversation with the audience as they yelled lyrics 
back and forth, arms waving in synch with the music. Little Egypt had students bob
bing their heads and singing along to their catchy hooks and meaningful lyrics.
Little Egypt is a Brooklyn-based hip-hop group with five members: Visual Poetics, 
Bravestar, Forge (who could not make it to the Carnival performance), Taajwar, and 
Khordz-255. The group was started by Visual Poetics, whose love for hip-hop 
bloomed during his time at CMU as an undergraduate studying civil engineering.
I had the first hip-hop show here on CMUs radio station, and then I started DJing for parties. My first big paycheck out of graduation was spent towards buy
ing equipment. Everything else dominoed into place, said Visual Poetics.
The group went on to write songs and perform in venues all around New York and 
the nation. They hope to continue performing and always to be given the chance to 
leave a mark in the places they go and on the people they meet.
I write to pass down the stories that are important to my peoples history to my
children and to my audience. Hopefully, Ill tell something meaningful enough 
for it to be repeated and passed down, said Visual Poetics.
It is this desire for permanence that led them to the name Little Egypt. The lega
cy of pride and determination that the Egyptians left behind for black people is 
something that Little Egypt desires to perpetuate through hip-hop, said Keon 
Calendar, a.k.a. Bravestar.
Evan Steele (a.k.a. Taajmar), fellow band mate and brother to Joe Steele, agreed 
with this bands vision of creating a legacy for others to be a part of.
The Egyptians built those pyramids that are still around today. We want our 
music to be like that, too. We look at ourselves as five architects that come up 
with designs and plans to plant into our childrens heads, said Taajmar.
Much like the Egyptian pyramids, lyrics do not come easily for this group. Their 
creation requires careful structural planning.
I write anywhere, when everybody is in the crib or when Im on the subway. No 
matter what Im doing, I can be writing rhymes in my head, said Taajmar.
Emcee Bravestar has different visions for the band. He writes lyrics with the goal 
of being the best.
I write to try to be better than all of the other emcees out there. I think that 
there are a lot of emcees that have no talent, so I want to go with my talent and 
get real deep. I want to be different. I want to be the best, said Bravestar.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Whites Pond was a common place for the local ducks to gather in those 
days. Often would I sit and watch the ducks go by, and the geese that raced 
amid the wind-blown waves, and I would toss breadcrumbs for them all.to 
enjoy. But there was one duck that often caught my attention. Gordo, as I 
dubbed him, was not like the others. By the look in his eyes, I could tell 
that he, above all else, craved flesh. And so, while I would tear bread for the others, for him 
I would bring beef. The finest quality cuts, grilled to perfection, and sliced oh so delicately. 
But one day I forgot, or maybe I ran out of time; it doesn't matter now. I had bread for the 
others, but no meat for Gordo, and I will never forget the tragedy of that day. How can I? 
Nothing can reclaim that little boys life. Nothing.

CLASSIFIEDS.
Clue
SciTeihT,A6 BtaPtapr
Just like the board game, wherein you must figure out 
who dunit. Six guests are invited to a dinner where the 
host supplies everyone with a different weapon just for 
the fun of it, I guess. The host ends up dead and 
everyone tries to figure out who killed him. Was it Mrs. 
White with the candlestick in the kitchen? Or Professor 
Plum with the lead pipe in the closet? Seriously, if this 
was my game, I would give people really whack 
weapons like a toilet seat or a shopping cart.
The Last Temptation of Christ
SsdnuhT,A6 BtaPtapr
Based on a novel written in 1955 by Nikos 
Kazantzakis, this movie portrays Jesus Christ as more 
man than god. He is confused and full of anxiety. Sex 
tempts him and his path in life scares him. Christ does 
not know if the voices in his head are from Satan or 
God. This 1988 film created a big stir with the entire 
Christian community, who condemned the movie. You 
should go see it. It may offend, disgust, or surprise 
you, but in the end, youll come to understand the 
many dimensions of Christ.
The Lord of the Rings: The Two 
Towers
SoufT,A6 lt CtaPtar
This is one very beautiful movie. If you havent seen 
the first one, do not worry: the second movie does 
everyone justice by succinctly recounting what has 
already happened. Everything in this story grows  the 
shadow of evil grows, the forces of good grow, and the 
power of the ring is stronger than ever. The story is all 
about good versus evil and the good that grows beyond 
hope. The cinematography is outstanding as it 
enhances the plot of the movie instead of distracting 
from it. The action sequences are crazy and there is 
this one scene with Legolas in it that will kill you.
Catch Me If You Can
Sm,GnuT,A6 C6RPtaPtap6RPr
This movie is based on the deceptive life of Frank 
Abagnale Jr., who became the most successful bank 
robber in the history of the U.S. at the age of 17. You 
will watch and learn as he transforms himself into a 
doctor, a lawyer, and a co-pilot for a major airline.
Bio Zombie
SmneT,A6 BtaPtapr
Look. I have SARS, I am freaking sick, and I feel like 
crap. That is what Bio Zombie is. Its like SARS.
