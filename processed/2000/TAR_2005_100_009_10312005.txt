Students who already think tlie cost of college in 
iiion is high may face paying at least hundreds of dol 
lars more if the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) has its way.
Thanks to a new set of rules that monitor online 
communication, colleges and universities may face 
having to revamp their existing online systems, paying 
millions of dollars lo do so. The American Council on 
Education (ACE) filed an appeal with the circuit court 
last week against the new rules that Carnegie Mellon 
Chief Information Officer Joel Smiih referred to as 
definitely an overkill.
Linder the Communications Assistance for I,aw I n 
forcement Act (CALKA) of 1994, telephone cofnpanies 
must pay to maintain their systems so that federal 
agents can easily obtain wiretaps. The most recent 
orders under this act, issued hv the FCC, asks that 
institutions providing Internet access also reengineer 
their systems accordingly within the next IS months. 
Carnegie Mellon is one such institution. Willi a sub
poena and the flip of a switch, federal officials could 
have access to e-mail accounts and online information 
of any student at compliant universities.
The Department of Justice wants 24/7 access,
whenevet they need it, and ihev vvani remote access. 
We find that too exiremelv burdensome in terms of 
money, staff, and technology, said Maureen Mef'alls, 
Direetoi ol (.overnmeni Relations lor Cai negie Mellon 
and I he coordinator of Carnegie Mellons response to 
this issue. According to an ACI . press release, I lie cost 
lo universities could be upwards of $7 billion, or at 
least $450 extra on each student's mil ion bill.
"Burdensome is really the best word loi the new 
rules," Mcl'alls added.
Colleges and universities have a long history of 
working with law enforcement agencies pursuing 
criminal investigations and are proud of our work 
ing relationship, said Sheldon I.. Steinbach, ACF. 
vice president and general counsel, in the. sanie press 
release. When you evaluate efficiency versus the 
incredible cosi of compliance, we just dont think ii 
makes a lot of sense.
According lo the new rules sei forth under CAI.EA, 
federal agencies vvanl to be able lo access a private in 
st il til ions network from almost any location at almost 
any lime. Currently, universities lake special precau
tions to make this kind of remole access very difficult, 
in order lo prevent online crime.
We do recognize the need to be in.compliance and 
cooperate wiili law enforcement, said Smith, but

Hullabaloo over the Hullabaloo
by Claire Morgenstern
Junior Staffwriter
In the wake of Hurricane Ka
trina, competition' between Tulanes student newspaper, the 
Tulane Hullabaloo, and The New 
Wave, written by professional 
staff employed by the university, 
created quite a hullabaloo. Ac
cording to an editorial published 
Oct. 14 by the Hullabaloo staff, 
the Hullabaloo believes that Tulanes administration created the 
New Wave with the intention of 
passing off what was a glorified 
newsletter as the main newspaper 
in connection with the school, 
and in the process undermined 
the Hullabaloos journalistic in
tegrity.
According to the staff editorial, 
The New Wave is heavily biased in 
favor of the administration, high
lighting only positive progress 
made since the disaster. The Hul
labaloo staff acknowledges that
other universities have printed 
similar newsletters; however, they 
felt that The New Waves slogan 
 The Newspaper of Tulane  
was misleading and undermined 
the Hullabaloos journalistic influ
ence. At the request of the Hulla
baloo, The'New Wave eliminated 
the slogan, put a link to the Hul
labaloo on their website, and even 
expressed interest in doing a story 
on them. However, Hullabaloo 
editor-in-chief Kate Schafer feels 
that the administration is still not
listening. The administration is 
not focusing on the things that 
make a university a university, 
she says.
The Hullabaloo is operated in
dependent of the University and 
funded entirely by advertising 
revenue. Maggie Brooks, busi
ness manager of the Hullabaloo, 
claims that the administration 
has always been responsive to 
their requests and that the two

Trading places
After going through millions in renovations, 
two first-year communities are turning their 
houses back over to Greeks for next year
by Andrew Peters
Junior Staffwriter
Just a year after establishing 
Forbes House, Carnegie Mellon 
spent one million dollars last 
summer to gut and re-outfit a for
mer fraternity house on Forbes 
Avenue. The result is the Global 
Studies House, a specialized liv
ing community for first-years 
interested in learning about the 
many different cultures at CMU. 
However, these two communi
ties may be short-lived, as they 
will be giving up their current 
locations next year.
The 29 students that call the 
Global Studies House home are 
both American and international 
students of almost all ethnic 
heritages. In an effort to make 
cultural connections and in
crease general awareness of 
different areas of the world, 
the Global Studies House hosts 
numerous discussion forums, 
group activities, and teleconfer
ences.
The house has a particularly 
strong bond with the Carnegie 
Mellon University Qatar Cam
pus. In addition to a recent tele
conference with several Qatar 
students, the house has hosted 
Qatar faculty for discussion on 
Mideast policy.
Senior Andy Butler, Global 
Studies and Forbes House Com
munity Advisor, says that be
cause of the houses growing 
reputation as a center of global 
thinking, many meetings are 
held here for more than just 
Global Studies residents. Campuswide meetings on Hispanic 
heritage, the Qatar campus, and 
study-abroad programs are just
a few examples.
According to Butler, the main 
goal of the Global Studies House 
is to foster a sense of community 
among its first-year residents.
There is an overwhelming 
sense of camaraderie between 
all the residents in the house, 
says Butler. House resident Lisa 
Augustyniak agrees.
You can leave your computer 
out and not be afraid someone 
will steal it, says Augustyniak, a 
first-year chemistry major.
Global Studies, however, is 
not the only specialized firstyear house on campus. Toward 
the back of the fraternity quad 
lies Forbes House, a living space 
set aside for emerging first-year 
interested in leadership and 
service. Forbes House engages 
in monthly service projects as a 
house, with very high levels of 
participation. The house spon
sored a Relay for Life team this 
year.
Because the residents of 
Forbes House chose to live here, 
they have a lot of enthusiasm and 
drive. They are very engaged in 
the community, says Butler. In 
addition to the relations Forbes 
has with the Pittsburgh com
munity, an equally important 
community is forming inside the 
house.
You really have to try hard 
to be involved and get to know 
each other. You are forced to 
talk to people and have respect 
for them, says resident Santiya 
Valerio.
Global Studies House and 
Forbes House each have one Res
ident Assistant and share a Com
munity Advisor. Butler notes

Student to conduct nuclear policy survey on campus
by Greg Hanneman 
Junior Staffwriter
Senior computer science 
major Josh Schnarr reads the 
newspaper every day. How
ever, he said he didnt know 
any specific information about 
U.S. nuclear policy.
That may change over the 
next four weeks as part of an 
independent study project, by 
Erik Sorenson, a senior in the 
physics department. Sorenson 
will attempt to measure, then 
enhance, CMU students knowl
edge of nuclear weapons policy 
through a series of surveys and 
articles over the next month.
Despite its importance as a 
part of international policy, 
information about nuclear 
weapons isnt often reported in
the news, said Lincoln Wolfenstein, professor emeritus of 
physics and Sorensons advisor 
for the project.
Wolfenstein, whose interest 
in nuclear issues dates back 
to when he learned of the 
atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, 
has taught several classes on 
nuclear weapons issues dur
ing his 57-year tenure at CMU. 
The most recent incarnation 
was offered in the fall semester 
of 2004 and incorporated ele
ments of both physics and engi
neering and public policy.
Sorenson was one of the 
students taking the class for 
a physics requirement. Before 
enrolling, he said that he had 
heard about nuclear issues in 
the news, but added, Its kind
Weekly Nuclear Awareness Poll
See NUCLEAR, page A3
by Erik Sorenson
Special to The Tartan
On August 6 and August 9, 
1945, the world witnessed its 
first  and, currently, only  
nuclear attacks, as the United 
States dropped atomic bombs on 
the Japanese cities of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki. It is estimated 
that 100,000 people died instan
taneously on detonation and 
that at least 140,000 additional 
deaths over the next 50 years 
can be attributed to these acts. 
The atomic bombs dropped on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 
developed during the infancy of 
the nuclear age and had yields 
of 15 kilotons and 22 kilotons,
respectively; in other words, 
the 15-kiloton atomic bomb 
dropped on Hiroshima had the 
same explosive power as 15,000 
tons of TNT.
During the Cold War, the pol
icy for the nuclear arms race 
between the United States and 
the USSR was mutual assured 
destruction (MAD). MAD policy 
assumed that a nuclear attack 
would be suicidal, since both 
countries had the ability to re
taliate. With the Cold War over 
as of 15 years ago, what does the 
United States weapons stockpile 
look like today?

Every 30 minutes, someone in this 
country dies in an alcohol-related car 
accident.
I tend to have a realistic take on 
things  some friends even call me 
a cynic. However, even I believe that 
people are bright and caring enough 
to protect themselves and their friends 
from a known and preventable killer 
like drunk driving.
But the fact is, Im wrong.
Nearly one third of college students 
would be diagnosed as alcohol abus
ers by psychiatric criteria. Two out of 
five of us would be considered binge 
drinkers. Perhaps most shocking is that 
2.8 million college students drove a car 
while under the influence of alcohol in 
2001 alone.
Alcohol-related injuries and deaths 
are the most obvious dangers we 
face as college students. They are so 
common that I would be unsurprised 
to learn that every one of us knows 
someone who has been involved in 
an alcohol-related accident. In fact, 
Carnegie Mellon very recently lost a 
member of its community to a fatal car 
crash. While an official cause has not 
been made public, there was suspicion 
that alcohol was a factor in the acci
dent. In fact, friends of the deceased 
have said that he had been known to 
drink and drive.
The student was visiting home when 
the accident happened, and no other 
cars were involved in the crash. If 
the student, who was underage, had 
been leaving a CMU party or had hit 
and killed another driver, this tragedy 
might have caused a bigger public up
roar. It might have hit closer to home 
for a broader segment of students.
In the end, I think everyone who 
felt the loss of this students death was - 
left wishing there was something that 
could have been done to prevent the 
tragedy.
There are some important things 
that anyone can do to save a life. But 
Ill be honest: Sometimes they arent 
easy.
First, if you see a friend drinking 
too much, say something. Be respect
ful and honest. You cant make some
one change, but you can help him (or 
her) change himself. Youll be putting 
yourself out on a limb and you might 
feel uncomfortable bringing it up, but 
its the best thing you can do as a 
friend.
Second, if you come across someone 
who has passed out as a result of drink
ing, check for the signs of acute alcohol 
poisoning:
 Is it hard to wake your friend up? 
Try pinching.
 Is your friend breathing slowly?
 Is your friends skin blue or 
clammy?
 Is your friend vomiting?
If you can say yes to one or more 
of these questions, call Campus Police 
(x8-2323) to get him to a hospital. 
The Universitys amnesty policy (see 
www. cm u. ed u/police/alcohol.htm) 
will protect you from punishment 
 its designed to get people help 
quickly, not root out and punish under
age drinkers.
Ill repeat that Im a realist. Col
lege students arent about to boot the 
booze, and drinking in and of itself 
really is not the problem. The prob
lem seems to be drinking irresponsibly. 
Preventing tragedy only requires two 
tasks: take the time in advance to fig
ure out how you will get home if you 
plan on drinking, and secondly, watch 
out for your friends.
Irresponsible drinking causes too 
much harm for us to ignore:
 1400 college students between 
the ages of 18 and 24 die each year 
from alcohol misuse.
 70,000 college students reported 
cases of sexual abuse because of alco
hol use.
 500,000 college students blame 
alcohol for causing them injuries each 
year.
 600,000 reported cases of stu
dents being assaulted by someone 
who had been drinking.
Each decision I make is mine and 
mine alone, but each decision I make 
can affect the lives of countless other 
people. Be responsible. Its worth it.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 31, 2005
Noted German dignitary lectures in Breed Hall
by Steven Spurgeon
Junior Staffwriter
The American people have 
not learned the extent of how 
unpopular the [Iraq] war was in 
Europe, former German ambas
sador to the United Nations Hans 
Arnold said on October 17, fol
lowing his lecture, Europe and 
the U.S.: Where Do We Go From 
Here?
Having served as Germanys 
foreign minister under the ad
ministration of former Chancel
lor Willy Brandt  noted for its 
infamous Ostpolitik and vot
ing scandals  Mr. Arnold drew 
on his wide experience during 
his lecture. Among the topics of 
his lecture, Arnold focused on 
American-European relations.
In an interview conducted 
before his lecture, Arnold ex
plained that although Europeans 
have a different approach to 
society, they share many beliefs 
arid ideals with their American 
counterparts.
Regarding the tense relation
ship between Europe and the 
Bush administration, Arnold re
marked that day-to-day politics 
generally fade away  in time, 
the arguments would fall to the 
side.
During his lecture, Arnold 
focused on the importance of 
connections between the United 
States and Europe. He remarked 
that both parts of the world 
share strong mutual interests 
and presented statistics to show 
that Europeans and Americans 
have what he believes are similar 
worldviews. Arnold emphasized 
that governments come and go, 
and although most Europeans 
may disagree with the current 
U.S. government, they have no 
quarrel with the American popu
lation as a whole.
In addition to stressing the im
portance of friendly transatlantic 
relations, Arnold explained the 
historical development of Eu
rope and how this development 
led to its current foreign policy. 
He discussed the formation of
the European Union, citing its 
significance as not only an eco
nomic connection, but a pro
cess of combining language and 
culture.
Europeans want to unite, but 
they do not want to be uniform, 
he said.
Part of the difficulty in es
tablishing such a union, he ex
plained, lies in combining all the 
different languages and subtle
ties of each nation into one com
mon forum for expression. At 
this point he related an anecdote 
about how when someone made 
a joke in the assembly, there 
would be a slow progression 
of laughter as it was translated 
throughout the room.
Further stressing the idea of 
diversity, Arnold presented a 
map of the European Union and 
showed how it has grown over the 
past decade. He detailed some 
of the inner workings of the Eu
ropean Parliament and likened 
the system to the American es
tablishment of equality between 
large and small states: Each
country has an equal voice in the 
system, through a distribution of 
votes based not as much on pop
ulation as on relative worth.
Following his lecture, the 
statesman answered questions 
from the audience, including 
one regarding the war in Iraq. 
Although he noted that the war 
was widely unpopular in Europe, 
he also stressed that the un
derstanding of Americans and 
Europeans is the same. He also 
remarked that he didnt see an
other American-European con
flict in sight over such an issue.
Ultimately Arnold conceded 
that although the problems be
tween the America and Europe 
are insignificant, there are also 
no real solutions to many of 
the most pressing issues facing 
our world.
With regards to international 
relations, Arnold said, the best 
hope for avoiding future conflict 
is through the channels of the 
United Nations, although [that] 
organization is not perfect in his 
opinion.

that opening up opportunities for 
first-years and helping them gain 
access to university resources, 
whether that means helping with 
research or going to the opera, is 
a large part of his staffs job.
The houses, however, are most 
likely not going to become perma
nent fixtures in the CMU commu
nity. The Global Studies House 
will not exist next school year in 
its current location, and whether 
it will exist as a living community 
in any form has yet to be decided. 
Forbes House will most likely 
exist next school year, but Butler 
said that it will not be located in 
the house it currently resides.
Renee Camerlengo, Global 
Studies and Forbes House Housefellow, says she is very pleased 
with the concept of the two 
houses and would like to see them 
persist, but the locations are first 
and foremost committed next
year to Greek chapter housing.
Darbi Roberts is working 
on a fifth-year scholar project 
to continue Forbes House, and 
members of Global Studies seem 
motivated to propose it as special 
interest housing for next year, 
said Camerlengo.
Speculation in regards to which 
fraternities and sororities will be 
allowed to move into the vacated 
houses next year remains, as yet, 
speculation. Though Butler said 
that several sororities have ex
pressed interest in moving onto 
the Greek Quad, only Kappa Al
pha Theta currently resides there. 
No other group, fraternity or 
sorority, has been authorized to 
move into the quad so far.
Whether these first-year com
munities continue in their pres
ent houses or in other locations, 
Butler said, Specialized freshman 
housing needs to exist. Groups of 
freshmen make a huge impact on 
this campus.

thing non-technical, he said, so
I was trying to think of an inde
pendent study.
Sorenson eventually decided 
to examine U.S. nuclear weap
ons policy and how it fits into 
the global perspective through 
a series of surveys that will be
passed out in classes and printed 
in The Tartan. Sorensen said he 
would also be advertising them 
by tabling and posting flyers 
around campus.
One aim of the project is to 
ascertain, in a qualitative way, 
what people know about nuclear 
weapons, Wolfenstein said, but 
the work includes an educational 
component as well.
After each poll is conducted, 
Sorenson plans to reveal the 
answers and present new infor
mation in weekly articles that 
will be published in The Tartan.
The goal is to raise awareness 
on campus, and for myself ... of 
what are the nuclear issues to
day, Sorenson said. I think its 
important for students and [for] 
myself to understand what our 
nation is putting out there.
We feel nuclear weapons pol
icies ^are one of the most impor
tant issues that face our coun
try and mankind, Wolfenstein 
agreed.
Wolfenstein said he wasnt sure 
what students level of knowl
edge about nuclear weapons and 
policy would be, noting, Its in
the back of their heads, not in 
the front.
Schnarr said he thought stu
dents would know that the U.S. 
has nuclear weapons and roughly 
which other countries do as well. 
He did, however, expect I dont 
know to be a popular response 
to multiple-choice questions.
Sorenson said he had no pre
dictions for what the knowledge 
level of the respondents would 
be. I hope people are respon
sive, he said. Even if they dont 
respond, I hope they read the 
answers next week.
Tulanes Hullabaloo has 
competition from staff
WAVE, from Al
parties maintain a good relation
ship. After Katrina, Tulane presi
dent Scott S. Cowen provided 
initial support to the Hullabaloo 
in the form of a lengthy interview. 
However, Schafer, who described 
the Hullabaloo's relationship as 
better than in years past, says she 
was caught off guard by the ad
ministrations publication of The 
New Wave: We understand that 
they have a job to do, but we have 
a job to do too.
Both Schafer and Brooks feel 
that the issue regarding The New 
Wave has been resolved and that 
there are more immediate issues 
that the Hullabaloo is facing cur
rently. Schafer explains that 
student organizations want to 
know what the extent of damages 
to their offices are so they can 
begin to repair them, but the uni
versity wont give students practi
cal ways to lend help. This isnt 
about competition, she says. 
This is about rebuilding the uni
versity.
Brooks sees The New Wave as 
only a temporary publication 
through which the administration 
can communicate in the face of 
this emergency. She doesnt be
lieve the paper will continue to be 
published past this semester. The 
Hullabaloo is publishing exclu
sively online this semester, but is 
receiving no advertising revenue 
and will have fewer funds for the 
spring semester than usual.
The Hullabaloos advisor, Tel 
Francois Bailliet, does not believe
these financial obstacles will deter 
the Hullabaloos staff. Ive always 
known that the papers staff is 
dedicated beyond belief, to the 
Hullabaloo and Tulane, so I wasnt 
surprised when they decided 
to keep going, despite being on 
separate campuses, Bailliet said. 
Proud, yes, but not surprised. 
On the other hand, Amber 
Stewart, a Tulane student dis
placed to CMU, believes both the 
Hullabaloo and The New Wave 
hold respective biases and neither 
is a completely trustworthy news 
source. She said she has not vis
ited the Hullabaloo's website and 
only briefly visited The New Waves 
website since she left Tulane. I 
think any school [in Tulanes situ
ation] would be trying to pump 
out as much good news as it can, 
Stewart said. However, regardless 
of the news that she hears, she 
says, I know I want to go back to 
Tulane.
Schafer recognizes that the 
university is going through a very 
difficult time has ultimately good 
intentions. She insists that the 
students on the Hullabaloo love 
the university. Brooks maintains 
that the Hullabaloos biggest con
cern is keeping students, alumni, 
and community members contin
ually informed as to the current 
status of their university, particu
larly those students now dispersed 
at universities across the country. 
It is not an obligation that the 
Hullabaloo staff takes lightly; as 
Brooks says, from the inception of 
Katrina, it was our duty to report 
to students.
ACE files appeal over 
proposed FCC rules
WIRETAP, from A1
it happens very rarely that they 
need this kind of access, here or 
nationally. According to a report 
from Educause, a nonprofit orga
nization that deals with online 
issues in higher education, there 
were 3468 wiretaps ordered by 
local, state, national, and For
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
(FISA) courts in 2004. The re
port also stated that the number 
or wiretaps on campuses is ex
tremely small.
So how is Carnegie Mellons ad
ministration reacting to these new 
proposed regulations? The school 
plans to work through the appro
priate channels for the University 
to make our views known, just 
as a matter of fact, that it would 
be very costly for every student 
in every college, said University 
Provost Mark Kamlet.
We are going to review the 
AAU [Association for American 
Universities] and ACE actions 
and perhaps take our own if we 
feel that we may have something 
different or more important to say 
than they do, said McFalls. For 
right now, however, we are waiting to see what happens next.
The ACE has hired attorney 
Maureen Mahoney to handle the 
appeal. She is well known for 
her work in securing a victory 
for the University of Michigan in 
its recent affirmative action trial. 
While the ACE has only filed an 
appeal, McFalls reports that other 
organizations  universities 
among them  might actually 
sue over this issue.
It is not, emphasized Kamlet, 
McFalls, Smith, and the ACE press 
releases, an issue of civil liberties. 
The FBI will still be required to 
get subpoenas for all wiretaps. 
But as Jerry Berman, the Presi
dent of the Center for Democracy 
and Technology, told the publica
tion Inside Higher Ed, Whenever 
you are talking about opening 
doors inside networks, you have 
to worry about whether it opens 
the door to broader discretion for 
the FBI to conduct surveillance. 
The potential for abuse is always 
there.

PeaceMaker: Real-life challenges become virtual
by Nicole Hayward
Stafwriter
Think of a challenging video gome 
with violence. Now think of a dangerous, 
real-life situation. Put them together, and 
you have PeaceMaker, a video game that 
dares you to tackle one of the toughest 
situations in the world: the conflict be
tween the Arabs and Israelis.
PeaceMaker is a current project at 
Carnegie Melloris Entertainment and 
Technology Center (ETC). Less than one 
year ago, PeaceMaker was just an idea 
rattling around in the head of Asi Burak, 
a Carnegie Mellon student working on 
a masters in Entertainment Technol
ogy. On an ETC program trip last winter, 
Burak ran into William Wright, producer 
of popular video game The Sims. After 
about an hours worth of conversation 
and advice, Burak set out to create a revo
lutionary game.
PeaceMaker was originally created as 
an educational tool for high school and 
college students in Palestine and Israel, 
but gaming companies and young Ameri
cans have been anxiously awaiting its 
release. Its a revolutionary idea, com
mented Laura Rose SehTo Scharfman, a 
student at Carnegie Mellon. Its a game 
that is promoting non-violence and is 
meant to constructively help people. 
Semo Scharfman has studied U.S., and 
Middle Eastern foreign policy but has yet 
to see technology play an important role 
in aiding the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In the game, players can choose to be 
the Israeli Prime Minister or the Palestin
ian President. In their chosen role, the
players will interact with seven other 
characters: Egypt, America, the Pal
estinian or Israeli leader, Palestinian 
Public, Israeli Public, and the United Na
tions. None of the characters in the game 
are specific people. Instead, all of the 
characters are historical representations 
of that area ... their reactions represent 
historically how they would react, said 
Burak.
While interacting with the other seven 
characters, the player is challenged to ne
gotiate a peaceful resolution while keep
ing the other seven characters hostility 
levels as low as possible. The players 
game score starts at 0, Mediocre Min
ister level. If the player makes progress 
toward a resolution while keeping his 
country satisfied, he gains points until he 
reaches 100, Nobel Prize Winner level. 
However, if the player makes choices that 
either do not satisfy his country or upset 
other countries, the player can drop to 
-100 points, War Criminal level.
While the complicated scoring system 
is written in Java, the game has a Flash 
interface. The program is written in such 
a way t ha t Java tags can easily be adjlisted 
to manipulate the game content. Such dy
namics are necessary for PeaceMaker to 
keep up with the changing political situa
tion. Every variable we add has so much 
complexity, said Burak, the characters 
care about security, economy, quality of 
life ... they react to that as well.
One of the most complex part of Peace
Maker s development was the different 
Scoring situations for the Israelis and 
the Arabs. Depending on which country 
leader played, there are distinct goals to 
keep in mind. As the Israeli Prime Min
ister, your goal is to increase internal 
and external authority. As the Palestin
ian President, yotir goal is to increase 
country security and gain the trust of the 
Palestinian government. But why do the 
teams have different goals?
We want them, as a player, to under
stand whats driving [the characters] 
reactions, said Eric Brown, co-producer 
on the PeaceMaker team. To develop the 
game, Burak and Brown interviewed Is
raelis, Palestinians, historians, and edu
cators to learn what each countrys cur
rent concerns are. And they found just 
that: differences in goals, complicating 
both real and virtual life.
Still, PeaceMaker is not complicated for 
the players alone. Burak called produc
ing the game a double challenge. While 
PeaceMaker is meant to be educat ional, it 
has be a fun, enticing game to play. Burak 
also pointed out that game content must 
be written very carefully: The subject is 
so sensitive. It might be one word that 
makes the player feel very offended. But 
theres always a neutral word that can be 
used.
The PeaceMaker team is still searching 
for the neutral words. Theyre also decid
ing on what content is appropriate for 
the game. Likewise, they are trying to 
incorporate actual events into the game, 
Brown said, but we have to assess what 
age to show the content of the game and 
the games level of violence. Brown also 
commented that while many games to
day incorporate violence, the use of realworld violence in a game can be much 
more alarming to the public.
While the PeaceMaker team is work
ing out the final kinks, the game has been
S

released for testing to a class at Carnegie 
Mellon called Arab Israeli Encounters. 
Taught by Professor Laurie Eisenberg, 
advisor to the PeaceMaker team, the class 
uses the game and video conferences 
with students at CMUs Qatar campus to 
discuss the Arab-Israeli.conflict.
PeaceMaker still has a long way to 
go. This week, the team will make their 
first appearance 011 Israeli television to 
discuss the program. After the games 
release, Brown foresees the team decid
ing on how to proceed past the Uni
versity. Once we put it out there ... we 
dont want to let it die. We cant let the 
content get old. Burak also commented 
that the game could take on many more 
directions: increasing the emotional
level, making it more accessible to young 
groups, and having it be more dynamic or 
multiplayer. However it is made, Peace
Maker may help make peace.

Chemical Engineering department celebrates 100 years
by Christine deBriffault
Junior Staffwriter
Alumni, faculty, and students 
gathered for a symposium to 
celebrate the departments suc
cesses, reminisce about its his
tory, and discuss the depart
ments current issues.
Since its inception, chemical 
engineering has transformed 
into a discipline that incorpo
rates all technologies and sci
ences. Andrew Gellman, head of 
the chemical engineering depart
ment, said The field of chemical 
engineering itself started as an 
empirical discipline, but it has 
since evolved into a more scien
tifically and moleCularly based 
discipline.
This diversity helps todays 
chemical engineers enter a va
riety of careers: supervising the 
operation of chemical plants, 
designing chemical processes 
for pollution prevention, and 
developing new products and 
processes. In his presentation 
during the celebratory event, 
alumnus Kears Pollock stated 
that he learned five lessons while 
at Carnegie Mellon: Respect 
wisdom, keep learning, observe, 
test, and dont give up. Pollock 
was able to apply these lessons 
to problem solving, managing a 
business, ethical leadership, and 
balancing lifes issues.
Success stories such as Pol
locks come from Carnegie Mellons stability, out-of-the-box 
thinking, and strength in computer-aided design, stated John 
Anderson, former dean of the 
College of Engineering.
In his presentation, Carnegie 
Mellons Chemical Engineer
ing Department over the Past 
Two Decades, Anderson re
inforced Gellmans thoughts 
on how chemical engineering 
has become a multidisciplinary 
endeavor.
More has changed in the 
chemical engineering depart
ment than its curriculum. Carol 
Dudley, vice-president at Dow 
Chemical, noticed the diversity 
of the people joining the depart
ment, particularly with respect 
to women. This diversity drives 
diversity of style which drives in
novation, said Dudley.
An audience member revealed
that at one point in time, 25 
percent of women engineers 
in the U.S. were studying at or 
had graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon.
Harvey Hinch, class of 1978, 
noticed that one of the greatest 
changes in the department has 
been its increase in size. Not only 
has the department itself grown, 
but it has expanded into several 
new buildings.
When asked what his favorite 
memory of the chemical engi
neering department was, Hinch 
recalled punching computer 
cards with only 80 characters for 
each card during late nights in 
the computer lab.
The first 100 years have suc
cessfully taken CMUs chemical

numerous changes in the disci
pline and the industry, and its 
graduates have initiated new 
changes and paradigm shifts in 
both. Gellmans final presenta
tion of the afternoon, The Next 
100 Years, assured us that the 
department will continue to 
grow and excel.
How Things Work: Caffeine
Kathy Chiapaikeo
How is it that Red Bull gives 
you wings? And even though 
coffee can give us bad breath 
and yellow teeth, it seems to 
be the solution to all our late 
nights. According to statistics 
on MedicineNet.com, up to 90 
percent of Americans consume 
caffeine each day, in the form 
of coffee, soda, or tea. So, how 
does caffeine work?
First, lets discuss how we fall 
asleep in the first place. The 
brain creates a sleep-inducing 
factor called adenosine. During 
the day, adenosine accumulates 
in the brain. It binds to adenos
ine receptors and causes nerve 
cell activity to slow down, and 
blood vessels to dilate, which 
gets more oxygen to the brain. 
In this way, adenosine causes 
fatigue, drowsiness, and sleep.
When caffeine enters the 
system, it alters the chemical 
makeup of the brain. Acting as 
a competitive inhibitor, caffeine 
mimics adenosine and binds to 
all the adenosine receptors in 
the brain. As a result, adenosine 
loses its ability to make our eyes 
droop.
So what happens? Your brain
no longer detects the presence 
of adenosine, so the nervous 
system cannot be regulated. If 
adenosine were detected, brain 
activity would slow down. In
stead, the pituitary gland begins 
to pump out signals that cause 
the adrenal glands to release 
adrenaline, the fight or flight 
hormone, Adrenaline brings 
your body to an alert state. 
Higher levels of adrenaline re
sult in an increased heart rate, 
dilated pupils, increased blood 
sugar released from the liver for 
energy, increased respiration, 
and blood vessel contraction. 
Your hands get cold because of 
blood vessel contraction, espe
cially since there is no adenos
ine to open them.
Excessive caffeine intake (say,
10 cups of coffee per day) results 
in difficulty sleeping, jitteriness, 
and anxiety. If you keep drink
ing coffee, bodily adrenaline 
levels remain high. This means 
your body is in a constant state 
of alert.
On the other hand, caffeine 
can be beneficial for some 
health problems. For example, 
headache medicines contain 
caffeine because it will close 
blood vessels and relieve the
headache.
Caffeine also increases the 
levels of dopamine in your brain. 
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter 
that stimulates the part of the 
brain that controls pleasure; it 
enhances your mood and state 
of well-being. Amphetamines, 
such as heroin and cocaine, 
also control dopamine levels by 
slowing down the rate of dopalennifer Kennedy/Art Staff
mine recycling.
The effects of caffeine are 
much less significant than those 
of amphetamines, but they are 
similar.
Caffeine causes dehydration 
because it inhibits the antidi
uretic hormone (ADH). ADH is 
involved in fluid storage in the 
body; it causes the kidneys to 
reabsorb water. When ADH is
not present, there is decreased 
water reabsorption in the kid
neys, which, in turn, increases 
the need to urinate.
Sustained, daily caffeine intake 
increases the bodys tolerance. 
Conversely, without caffeine, 
the body becomes oversensitive 
to adenosine. This causes blood 
pressure to drop, resulting in 
headaches and dizziness. Other 
withdrawal symptoms include 
irritability, resdessness, and dif
ficulty concentrating.
Caffeine has long-term nega
tive effects on sleep. Continuous 
adenosine blocking from the 
brains adenosine receptors will 
prevent the body from entering 
the deepest part of sleep.
The short-term effects of caf
feine are advantageous if you 
want to stay awake. It takes ef
fect in as little as 15 minutes and 
will stay in the body for about 
six hours. Caffeine blocks ad
enosine reception so you dont 
get sleepy. It also gives the body 
an adrenaline boost and in
creases dopamine levels, which 
makes you feel good.
Caffeine does have some pos
itive effects, but keep in mind 
that the long-term effects can 
be damaging.A

Oxygen-bearing ore 
found on the Moon
Using the Hubble Space Tele
scope to image the moon, scien
tists discovered areas where the 
mineral ilmenite was located. 
Ilmenite is composed of iron, ti
tanium and oxygen, and may be 
a source of breathable oxygen for 
future moon expeditions. Extract
ing oxygen from ilmenite can also 
produce water, a potential source 
of hydrogen rocket fuel. The tele
scope returned high-resolution 
ultraviolet images of the moon, 
which, after spectroscopic analy
sis, should prove valuable in the 
search for oxygen-bearing ore,

Ugly and cumbersome, sure; but is it art?
Weeks ago you couldnt walk across 
campus without noticing the gaping 
hole in the ground between Doherty and 
Baker Halls. Ironically placed next to a 
patch of earth that was being reseeded, 
the crater on CFA lawn was curiously 
filled as quickly as it appeared.
So why the digging? Why rip up the 
ground just to fill it again? Was it part 
of an organic biology project in which 
MCS classes would study geological 
and botanical properties found on our 
own campus? No, it wasnt. It was the 
groundwork for adding another piece of 
donated art to our campus.
Weve experienced a lot of odd art 
additions to campus recently. The multi
colored snowman was bad, but bearable. 
And the Kraus Campo raised the bar for 
what we considered to be an eyesore and 
waste of space on campus.
But this new sculpture by Jon Borofsky 
(A64), slated to be installed in the com
ing months, threatens to cross boundar
ies of taste that some of the other art on 
campus never dared. Picture a metallic, 
four-story pole protruding at a 15-degree 
angle from the Mall. Slap a random lifesize man walking up the slope, and voil : 
the latest addition to our campuss poor 
choices of abstract art.
The vaguely phallic Man Walking to 
the Sky has apparently struck a nerve; 
students who have seen pictures of what 
the sculpture looks like have said exactly 
what we did: wow, thats god-awful.
One of the most important consider
ations is the lack of consistency amongst 
the architectural and artistic styles on 
campus. CFA is one of the most beau
tiful buildings on campus; Margaret 
Morrisons design qualities are undeni
ably admirable; Baker-Porter is dark, 
slanted, and leaves much to be desired; 
Wean is downright depressing. The 
University Center and the Purnell Center 
were a step in the right direction dur
ing their construction in the 1990s; but 
this latest trend toward bizarre, tacky 
art installations is a turn for the worse. 
A trustee has donated Borofskys work, 
and the administration has decided that 
a pole with a man walking atop is fitting 
with our campus decor.
Weve got to stop this before it be
comes a habit.
Now, please dont be misled to believe 
that there isnt support for art on cam
pus. Theres plenty of room for thoughtprovoking installations that have the 
backing of both the administration and 
the student community. A 40-foot-tall
pole that will mar the center of the mall 
and remove essential activity space is in 
no way worth placing.
Borofskys art is a little bit outside the 
realm of what weve seen before. Among 
his works: the number 2,264,477 
painted on a large sheet of paper; a can
vas with the words Object of Magic in 
acrylic; and five sculpted men depicted 
installed above a convention center to 
give the appearance of flying. And we 
get a 40-foot pole. The question we want 
answered is how the administration be
lieves this piece of art fits into our cam
pus landscape and what it is supposed to 
reflect about life here at CMU.
Despite the sometimes ugly exteriors 
of our buildings, we cant deny the 
rich historical background most of 
them have. The erection of this 40-foot 
monstrosity, however, will undoubtedly 
overshadow the history represented by 
the other features of our campus. Picture 
prospective students, unable to focus on 
their campus tour because they are too 
busy gaping at and confused by the huge 
phallus we chose to put in the center 
of our campus. As Andy Warhol once 
said, Art is anything you can get away 
with. Lets not let CMU get away with 
this one.
Rosa Parks struggle continues even today
The late Rosa Parks has been called 
the matriarch of the civil rights move
ment. Her cool defiance on December 1, 
1955, has served as the highest example 
in the fight for equality in our country. 
However, Rosa Parks refusal to relin
quish her bus seat is not what makes 
her deserving of the acclaim she has 
received.
We make a bad habit of perceiving 
things simply  its just easier than try
ing to get at the nuances. But the cost of 
this mental laziness is real. Just as many 
of us simplify the significance of Rosa 
Parks, we tend to simplify and  even 
worse  downplay the continuing chal
lenges of prejudice.
Rosa Parks was by no means the first 
to defy a bus drivers commands. In 
March of 1955, a fifteen-year-old girl 
named Claudette Colvin had refused to 
change seats at the drivers order, and 
was arrested. Black activists met with 
Colvin to evaluate if she could serve 
as a good test case and to see if she ' 
would give the right impression in a 
fight of unprecedented magnitude. The 
young Colvin was pregnant and unmar
ried. Rosa Parks, as secretary of the 
local NAACP chapter, was at the meet
ing when activists decided to wait for a 
better opportunity.
Again, in October, a woman named 
Mary Louise Smith disobeyed an or
der to change seats, and again NAACP 
leaders chose to wait for a more up
standing example.
When Rosa Parks was asked to move 
to the back of the bus, leaders decided 
the time was right. She had a steady 
job; she was married; and, more im
portantly, she had a quiet fortitude as 
well as political savvy, in the words of 
Rita Dove, former U.S. poet laureate. 
They organized around. her instantly. 
So began the 381-day Montgomery bus 
boycott.
It was not Parks act of protest alone 
that transformed her into an indelible 
v icon; it was the way she presented her
self as an equal human at a time when 
most whites saw her solely as just an
other black.
Not only do too many people mis
understand Rosa Parks precise role in 
the civil rights movement, many people 
today treat the civil rights movement as 
something that is complete, its job done. 
That perception is patently false.
At the age of 89, Parks said in an inter
view, It pains me that there is still a lot 
of Klan activity and racism. I think when 
you say youre happy, [then] you have 
everything that you need and everything 
that you want, and nothing more to wish 
for. I havent reached that stage yet.
Discrimination is as much an issue 
now as it has ever been, and it is present 
with us at Carnegie Mellon University. 
In each of the past two years, we 
witnessed explosive flare-ups of racial 
tension. Each time, amends were made 
and people moved on. But the problem 
remains: there has been little change in 
the cultural climate of the University.
We need to realize that while, 
technically, the Civil rights movement 
is over, things are not as they should be. 
Racism is still rampant in our country, 
and Pennsylvania houses the highest 
concentration of Ku Klux Klan members 
in the nation. And as close to home as our 
own campus, there still exists unspoken 
racial tension in our community.
We should respect Rosa Parks for her 
contribution to history, but acknowledge 
that her idolization overshadows the 
persisting cultural divide. Lets mourn 
her death, but take her actions in life as a 
stepping stone rather than an end point.

The latest Tartan Editorial Board 
piece, I wasnt using my academic 
rights, anyway, highlights the confu
sion surrounding the proposed amend
ment to the Universitys Students 
Rights policy that the Academic Affairs 
Committee presented to Student Senate 
and Vice-Provost for Education Indira 
Nair in early October. This effort has 
come under heavy criticism by some 
who have misunderstood the spirit 
behind it. Although the issue of aca
demic freedom is a loaded one, sensa
tionalizing the Committees intentions 
is not beneficial to the goal of helping 
students. All of us seek to ensure that 
students are not discriminated against 
in the classroom for their views, while 
preserving the ability of professors to 
shape the intellectual environment that 
drew all of us to Carnegie Mellon in the 
first place.
The third right of students is 
nothing revolutionary. The proposed 
amendment does not limit academic 
freedom but enhances it by consolidat
ing sections of University Policy into 
a form that would be more accessible
and meaningful to students, the very 
alternative suggested by some crit
ics. Students should not have to sift 
through dense, cumbersome text to 
locate policies most relevant to them. 
Furthermore, the proposal makes no 
changes to the appeals process, a fair 
and thorough system as it exists.
We believe that this issue is the most 
important academic debate of our time. 
Students at colleges across the country 
are pushing for basic changes similar 
to ours, while others seek more drastic 
measures whose merits are debatable 
and unfortunately clouded by politics. 
Ultimately, Carnegie Mellon students 
will and should follow a constructive 
path of their own that best fits their 
needs. Only by maintaining an open 
dialogue between students, adminis
trators, and faculty members can we 
work toward enhancing the goals of the 
University. In our view, both the student 
and the instructor play equally vital 
roles in an academic environment.

College of Fine Arts: 
Unscientific greatness
Benjamin Hackett
This 2005-2006 academic year 
marks the Centennial of the College of 
Fine Arts. Mostly overshadowed by the 
academic gigantism of the computer 
science and engineering programs, this 
100-year anniversary has progressed 
with relative silence. Considering the 
prestige associated with CFA in related 
professional fields, pervasive announc
ing of the importance of a thriving 
arts program on this campus is entirely 
warranted.
When design, architecture, art, music 
and drama combine, the whole is truly 
greater than the individual parts. These 
programs often work cross-departmentally, putting together projects and 
exhibitions for the entertainment and 
betterment of the community.
Recent CFA activities continue the 
tradition of purposeful endeavors. The 
Design and Architecture departments 
boast the joint institutional program 
Pittsburgh Synergy, the Pittsburgh 
Solar Decathlon house, exhibiting how 
design and functionality can mesh 
seamlessly.
The School of Art, boasting such 
alumni as Andy Warhol, Mel Bochner, 
Joyce Kozloff, and Deborah Kass, is 
planning an exhibition in celebration of 
the Centennial, titled 100% Centennial! 
to open January 20, 2006.
The accolades continue in the schools 
of Drama and Music. The 2005 Tony 
Awards and Nominations list speaks to 
the thorough nature of the program. 
Cherry Jones received the award for 
Best Actress in a Drama. Sutton Foster 
was nominated for Best Actress in a 
Musical. Christian Borle received the 
Clarence Derwent Award in 2005 
and was nominated for a Drama Desk 
Award for his work in Spamalot.
The prestige of the program has 
drawn renowned Broadway alumni 
back to Carnegie Mellon for collabora
tions. Consider the most recent produc
tion from the School of Music, A Chorus 
Line. The musical attracted Chet Walker
 a Broadway choreographer, director 
and performer  to participate. Mr. 
Walker served as the choreographer 
and stage director. Walkers numerous 
credits include the conception of chore
ography for the 1999 Tony award-winning musical Fosse.
A Chorus Line ran from October 27 
to October 30 in Kresge Recital Hall. 
The buildup was such that Marvin 
Hamlisch, the musicals original com
poser, attended a Saturday show. 
Hamlisch, currently the Pittsburgh 
Pops principal conductor, has won four 
Emmys, three Oscars, four Grammys, 
one Tony, and three Golden Globe 
awards. Its prestigious attendees reflect 
the dedicated efforts of all involved in 
the production.
The effort was definitely felt, because 
A Chorus Line is a difficult production to 
undertake for voice students due to the 
complexity of the choreography. The 
student talent took this fact in stride, 
performing amicably and successfully.
A Chorus Line is presented as a series 
of stories told by hopeful dancers on 
the line auditioning for a Broadway 
production. The show was exemplary, 
and two aspects of the production were 
incredibly striking.
Senior music major Monica Thakkar 
(Diana) featured Nothing, a song per
formed with lucid emotion and such 
purposeful clarity that one could not 
help but be moved. Thakkars exuber
ance was defined, offered in a naked 
truth rarely observed.
In another showstopping perfor
mance, senior music major Tyler 
Ruebensaal performed a spoken mono
logue. This was easily the productions 
high point. Ruebensaal (Paul) presents 
a monologue detailing the first, and 
only, work he could get to break into 
show business. Ruebensaals masterful 
performance had audience members 
choked up and tearful. Performances 
such as these highlight the exceptional 
talent one can experience when attend
ing campus productions.
The fact is that ones tuition goes to 
cover all the potential exposures and 
experiences that make higher educa
tion worthwhile. Academic develop
ment devoid of cultural exposure and 
human interaction cannot, and should 
not, be the aim of an institution at the 
university level.
There are those who think a singers 
development of vibrato is as equally 
amazing as the ability to command a 
remote-controlled Hummer. Those in 
appreciation of a worldly education 
should certainly agree.

Highlander 
Caf coming 
to fruition
I hope all students enjoyed 
Homecoming this year and learned 
a little more about Carnegie 
Mellon University and its his
tory. One major project through 
the University  specifically the 
Office of Housing and Dining  
will hopefully alter the history of 
one of the biggest failures in the 
schools recent history.
The area currently known as 
Highlander Caf is receiving a 
massive makeover. The new plan 
calls for another eating area on 
campus, currently being referred 
to as the Third Place, to replace 
Highlander. This place will hope
fully serve as another meeting 
place on campus and be about 
more than dining. Students who 
purchase food at the trucks on 
Margaret Morrison will be allowed 
to take their food in there and eat. 
This plan also calls for utilizing the 
walkway along Resnik by creating 
some seating along the outside.
On a note unrelated to din
ing, exercise equipment will be 
placed on the second floor area 
of Highlander, and unlike the 
University Center people eat
ing wont be able to watch the 
people exercising. The first phase 
is scheduled to open in the be
ginning of the spring semester of 
2006. Tim Michael, Director of 
Housing and Dining Services, has 
spearheaded this project and has 
amazing plans for the second and 
more detailed phase and possible 
additions in the future. Tim has 
also come up with other ideas to 
improve Dining Services on cam
pus, including the creation of a 
Dining Advisory Council (DSAC).
In a Presidential Perspectives 
from a month ago or so, I men
tioned how DSAC will be com
posed of students and faculty 
members. Ultimately, I worked 
with the president and presi
dent pro tempore of the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC) to 
choose the nine student members, 
one of which had to be a graduate 
student. Tim is trying to gather 
the remainder of the faculty mem
bers to round out the 13-person 
council. He believes that the first 
meeting will occur in November 
prior to the Thanksgiving break. 
The Student Body President and 
the President of SDC will serve 
as ex-officio members. I encour
age you to contact me if you have 
any concerns that you would like 
DSAC to address; I will bring them 
to the attention of Tim Michael. I 
would like to thank anyone who 
expressed interest to me about be
ing on DSAC.
As we begin the second half of 
the semester, I would like to wish 
everyone the best on their per
sonal and academic endeavors.
Tom (sbp@) is proud of the im
provement of food on campus since 
he was a first-year and welcomes 
all concerns via phone (412-657- 
3953), email (sbp@,), or in person

The Controversial Speakers Policy aint broke, so dont fix it
Justin Brown
A university is an institution 
for higher learning. A univer
sity is a place to learn, to grow 
(both mentally and physically 
 freshman 15 anyone?), and 
to experience things that youve 
never experienced before, such 
as staying out late on school 
nights, drinking bubble tea, and 
maybe even meeting people that 
think differently than you do. 
You do know that not everyone 
agrees with you, right?
Which brings us to this uni
versitys conterversial speakers 
policy imbroglio.
Speech, in general, has a lot to 
do with this whole experiencing 
new ideas thing. Does it mean 
that you have to follow or believe 
in any of these new ideas? No. 
I still believe in being socially 
capable, for instance. Is it bad to 
hear things that you dont agree 
with? Most certainly not. If you 
truly believe what you think, 
then hearing the opposite view 
will only strengthen your own. 
Or maybe youll find that some 
ideas you hold can be improved 
upon, or altogether replaced.
What about someone who 
holds a belief that you just know, 
deep-down, must be wrong,' like 
John Kerry? He thinks that abor
tion is justified in some cases, 
that killing a living being is okay. 
If you disagree, would attending 
one of his speeches change your 
mind? If so, your original belief 
must not have held much ground
(or maybe he just charmed you 
out of it).
Free speech is a good thing. 
People can think what they want 
and people can say what they 
want. If anything, a university 
has more of a responsibility to 
uphold these truths than the 
country that surrounds it. Higher 
learning is not unitary. There are 
disagreements on just about ev
erything, and that is what helps 
us progress as individuals and
as a society. We, as people, have 
a right to know all sides and to 
make our own decisions. This is 
why changing the Controversial 
Speakers Policy would be a 
ridiculous and irresponsible 
move by the University.
If you havent heard already, 
CMUs Controversial Speakers 
Policy has been called to review 
by President Cohon. A commis
sion has been formed to judge 
university-wide opinion on 
whether or not this policy needs 
revision, and if so, what should 
be revised.
I am not against the review. 
I recognize that policies should 
be reviewed every so often, and 
I find this a good practice. I am, 
however, against some of the 
insane- recommendations that 
Ive heard coming from other 
students and faculty.
For example, someone actually
suggested that if five percent or 
more of the student population 
disagreed with what a speaker 
was going to talk about, then 
that speaker should not be al
lowed to come to campus. No, 
that wasnt a typo: five percent.
Hmm. I suspect that would 
leave about... zero speakers. Can 
you imagine? Microsoft wouldnt 
even be allowed to speak here, 
because I sure dont agree with 
them, and Im pretty certain
I could find others that dont 
either.
A suggestion was made that we 
adopt more measures of safety 
for the speaker, the proponents, 
and the opponents. I do agree 
that it is the Universitys respon
sibility to ensure the safety of ev
eryone on its campus; however, I 
dont think this sort of provision 
belongs in the Speakers Policy. 
Safety should be available for all 
events, and should not tie down, 
nor be tied down by, controver
sial speakers.
The line blurs when peo
ple make arguments that are 
educated yet debatable. When 
the topic of hate speech comes 
around, the easy answer is hate 
speech bad, me no like hate 
speech. So lets ban it.
Except, then, how do you clas
sify hate speech? Who decides 
what is and what is not hate
speech? Do we take a popular 
vote on every single speaker 
who comes to campus? Or does 
a small group decide? Or one 
person? Put the right group in 
charge and Michael Moore cant 
come to campus. The way he 
talks about Bush is hate speech. 
Put the right group in charge 
and President Bush cant come to 
campus. The way he talks about 
terrorists seems like hate speech 
to me. Put the right group in
charge and Winston cant come 
to campus. The way he talks 
about Big Brother is double plus 
ungood hate speech.
The current policy says that 
the students have a right to 
hear. This does not mean that 
the University must stand behind 
all of the speakers, or even fund 
them. They must only provide 
equal and open resources to all 
speeches  a safe place to speak 
and a safe place to hear.
An organization may choose 
to fund a speaker with its own 
money (even if that money 
comes from the Activities Fee) 
regardless of what the University 
 says. And this is not to say that 
no one should be held account
able if something bad happens, 
but I for one put faith in my 
fellow students to make respon
sible decisions.
If men and women are to
value freedom, they must expe
rience it, says the current policy. 
If they are to learn to choose 
wisely, they must know what the 
choices are; and they must learn 
in an environment where no idea 
is unthinkable and where no al
ternative is withheld from their 
consideration. The University is 
not our babysitter. It should not 
decide what we can and can
not hear. The University is our 
protector, but thought is not a 
weapon. If a riot were to occur, 
the University would provide the 
resources to quell it. If a group of 
students were singled out by an 
irresponsible speaker, that group 
of students would be protected 
by the University.
I want to be protected, too. 
I want my freedom protected. 
Not my freedom to do whatever 
I please, but yes, my freedom 
to think whatever I please, and 
speak and write whatever I 
please. And I extend this free
dom to you. Please, disagree 
with me. Thats your right. Show 
up to the next town hall meeting 
(Tuesday, November 1, 5 pm in 
McKenna) and the one after that 
(Thursday, November 10, 5 pm 
in McConomy), and voice your 
opinion, because it is your right 
to do so. I personally encourage 
you to take to heart what Ive 
said and fight for your freedom 
alongside everyone else  let 
the review commission know 
that the policy should remain 
as is.
Justin Brown is not a number; 
Justin Brown is a free man. He can 
be reached at justinbr@.
The University ... should not decide what we can and 
cannot hear. The University is our protector, but thought 
is not a weapon.

I was sitting in class when the bright 
pink website on a classmates laptop 
screen caught my eye. It was so bright 
and nauseating that I couldnt tear myself 
away. More than just my eyes were 
assaulted though; my sensibilities were 
attacked. The girl in front of me was look
ing at www.divapup.com, a site that ships 
out purebred puppies to their owners. 
Theres little background on the family 
given before the transaction; and the two 
parties, puppy and family, never even 
meet before the puppy is shipped off.
Even worse is how the website mar
kets their pups. Lindsay Lohan sports 
a cuddly new accessory  her DivaPup 
 as she leaves a New York City studio, 
read the caption to one of the sites pho
tos. Accessory? Your puppy is not a Kate 
Spade.
The site Im pinpointing is Emma Roses 
Maltese DivaPups, but there are probably 
others like it. The goal is to find the puppy 
that looks the most appealing, buy it, Wait 
until it is eight weeks old, and have it 
shipped to the nearest airport.
There are more than just a few things 
seriously wrong with this process. Though 
you may ask the site managers as many 
questions as you like about the dog, you 
never meet the pooch before you pur
chase. Maybe Im being a little naive, 
but to me, a puppy is a family member 
that you bring home with the consent of 
everyone, including the pup. How can 
people tell if a dog is right for them based 
on a picture? What if there turns out to be 
a poor fit between your family and your 
new puppy? I simply cannot understand 
those who have no desire to meet the 
creature that they will share their home 
with for 10 to 15 years. Let alone the fact 
that you pay through the nose for these
puppies. Getting a cat or dog is a delicate 
choice that should only be made after you 
meet the animal.
I am even more disgusted by the sug
gestion that dogs are akin to accesso
ries. Maybe Emma Rose thinks it is 
amusing to call Lindsay Lohans puppy 
an accessory. The problem is there are 
people who love their dogs looks more 
than the dog. And they also enjoy what 
certain dogs seem to suggest about their 
owners. A DivaPup, the site insinuates, is 
fashionable.
The trouble is that we are not talk
ing about a handbag, but rather a living 
creature. I am not trying to claim that 
owners of DivaPups toss their animals 
into the bureau drawer at the dayfc end, 
but I do believe that viewing a dog as an 
item to pump up your prestige is deplor
able. Emma Roses puppies are the in 
dogs of the moment  the easily portable 
creatures that pop their fuzzy heads out 
of designer bags. But buying a dog for its 
looks and not for love is the wrong way 
to go about it. I sincerely hope that if the 
puppys behavior or appearance doesnt 
live up to expectations, they dont suffer 
physical or emotional neglect.
Emma Roses site does do a brief check 
to establish whether the person is a suit
able pet owner, but no one meets with the 
buyer before the exchange, nor is there 
any way to prove that what is said in the 
online form is true. The dogs also come 
with warnings not to give them certain 
vaccines, because puppies in the past have 
reacted poorly to them. The DivaPups are 
super cute and very expensive, with one 
Maltese listed at four thousand dollars. 
The pups are also completely unknown 
to the new owners when they arrive. 
They must be extremely well-protected 
in their early life to prevent disease and 
even death  the site cautions not to let 
them in public for the first six months. 
Furthermore, they are marketed as fash
ion items. And though the site occasionEric ieng

so on and so forth, it is hard to imagine 
anyone obtaining a newborn with a few 
thousand dollars cash and a few forms 
saying that they know what they are get
ting into and have access to health care.
What DivaPups is selling are, quite 
frankly, dangerous. They are living being 
purchased on faith and picture alone. This 
is contrary to all the things that good dog
owners know, such as that the best pet 
youll ever own is the one that licks your 
face when you visit the dog shelter.

Senior Sean Filipovitz slammed 
home a loose ball in the box to 
give the Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team a 2-1 victory Friday 
night over Case Western Reserve, 
the seventh straight win for the 
Tartans, ranked 19th in their divi
sion.
Filipovitzs goal came in the 
80th minute after a corner kick 
by Daniel Mastalski resulted in a 
scrum in front of the net. When 
the ball squirted to the side, Fili
povitz was standing all alone to 
drill it by Case goalie Chad Skid
more.
It was a physical, hard-fought 
game for CMU (12-1-1), which 
was playing its first game on
the road in nearly a month. Jon 
Brown, the schools all-time scor
ing leader, opened the game with 
a breakaway goal in the 18th 
minute. The score came off a 
long through pass from first-year 
Daniel Brackley. Just six min
utes later, though, Case (8-7-2) 
tied the game on a goal by R.J. 
French, who headed in a direct 
kick just outside the box.
In the second half, CMU had 
numerous chances to pull away. 
A hand ball in the box gave the 
Tartans a penalty kick, but Fil
ipovitzs attempt was knocked 
away by Skidmore. Minutes later, 
Jonathan Browne missed a pointblank try just over the bar. Then, 
in the 66th minute, Will Schlough 
nudged a header inches wide.
Cases best opportunity came 
on a counterattack in the 55th

With the loss, CMU will likely

Homecoming victory
touchdown. Trailing 13-10, the 
Tartan offense rode the strong 
running of Sivek down the field 
as Greenstein kicked his second 
field goal of the half to tie the 
game as time expired.
The third quarter of the game 
was a defensive battle marked 
by turnovers. A missed punt min
utes into the period gave Case the 
ball at the Tartan 20-yard line. 
However, the Tartan defense, 
which had run into trouble last 
week in a 33-7 loss at Chicago, 
held tough. As the Spartans drove 
to the 13-yard line, Scarmazzi 
came up big again with a sec
ond interception, this time in the 
end zone, to end Cases red-zone 
chances. This play set the tone for 
the rest of the third quarter, as 
neither team managed to score.
The scoring drought would 
end with the second drive in the 
fourth quarter. Facemeyer was 
intercepted for the second time, 
giving the Spartans possession at 
the Tartan 41-yard line. Five plays 
later they 'would find the end 
zone, using the deep pass again to 
burn the Carnegie Mellon defense 
with a 27-yard touchdown. A suc
cessful extra point put the visiting 
team ahead 20-13 with just nine 
minutes to play.
The Tartans responded with 
a clock-eating drive that would 
knot the score at 20-20. The 
team ripped off 15 straight runs, 
including 12 by Sivek, to march 
75 yards. Siveks four-yard touch
down run tied the game with just 
1:27 to play.
The CMU defense would step 
up to the challenge once more, 
as Mike Burnsides sack on first 
down set the tone for the Case 
possession. After three plays and 
just 48 seconds, the Spartans 
were forced to punt.
Senior return-man Adam 
Bowlands 19-yard return put the 
Tartans at midfield with 39 sec
onds to play. Sticking with what 
had been successful, the team 
continued to run the ball and 
use their timeouts wisely. Sivek 
ripped off an 18-yard carry to put 
the team in field-goal range, and 
after a series of timeouts as Case 
attempted to ice Greenstein, the 
team lined up for what would 
be a career-long 41-yard attempt 
with just four seconds left on the 
clock. The kick sailed through the 
uprights as time expired to give 
the Tartans the win.
Sivek finished the day with 
a career best 196 yards on 
31 carries. Facemeyer ended 
the day going 7 of 12 in passing 
attempts for 72 yards.
The game was great redemp
tion for the Tartans, who lost 
to Johns Hopkins 9-6 earlier in 
the season on a last second kick. 
Ultimately, it was the officials and 
not the wind that cost the Tartans 
a chance to win that game. Two 
poor spots late in the game sty
mied the Tartans shot for a come
back. Furthermore, the team was 
hurt by the absences of junior 
running back Joe Hurley and 
junior linebacker Thomas Pfister.
The Tartan defense still contin
ued the high level of play which 
was evident in week two against 
Grove City, and the offensive unit 
showed that when not plagued by 
turnovers it was effective in mov
ing the ball both on the ground 
and in the air.
The Tartans will face Bethany 
College next week, at Bethany. 
They can secure their 31st con
secutive season with a .500 
record by winning either against 
Bethnay or in their final game 
against Thiel College.

The Academic Bowl is back 
at Carnegie Mellon. In front of 
a big Homecoming crowd on a 
warm October morning, Carnegie 
Mellon used a field goal as 
time expired to defeat the Case 
Western Spartans 23-20.
The win brings th Tartans 
record to 4-4 overall and keeps 
the team in the hunt for a winning 
season record. More importantly, 
the victory brought the Academic 
Bowl Trophy, awarded to the win
ner of this rivalry game, back to 
the Carnegie Mellon campus.
The Spartans started the game 
strong, and it looked as though 
the Tartans would be sent to their 
third straight loss. Just four min
utes into the game Case held a 
6-0 lead thanks to a 39-yard 
touchdown pass. However, a 
missed extra point opened the 
door for Carnegie Mellon, who 
responded with a seven-minute 
drive that ended with a 4-yard 
touchdown rush by sophomore 
running back Travis Sivek. Junior 
kicker Nathaniel Greenstein 
nailed the extra point to put the 
home team on top.
After a Spartan-missed field 
goal, Greenstein struck again to 
cap off a 70-yard drive, booting a 
27-yard field goal to stretch their 
lead to 10-6. After exchanging 
possessions, the Tartans caught 
a break when sophomore Nat 
Scarmazzi picked off a Spartan 
pass to bring the offense back onto 
the field. However, this opportu
nity turned into a disaster three 
plays later, as first-year quarter
back Doug Facemeyers pass was

XC takes UAA conference championship
by Andrew Clearfield
Assistant Sports Editor '
When senior Nick End fell 
halfway through Saturday after
noons UAA conference cham
pionship race at Schenley Park, 
it appeared as though any hope 
the Tartans cross-country team 
had of upsetting a higher-ranked 
field and bringing the school its 
first conference championship 
since 1989, went down along 
with him.
But rather than give up on 
the race, End jumped right up, 
dusted himself off and ran his 
best time of the season, lead
ing the unranked Tartans to an 
unexpected UAA tide over such 
nationally ranked foes as NYU 
and Washington University.
Nick took a really bad fall 
there, said senior All-American 
Dana Irrer. For him to get up so
quickly and still finish so well I 
think really motivated the guys 
behind him on our team to just 
go all out.
Indeed, the Tartans third 
through fifth runners all set per
sonal records en route to earn
ing All-UAA honors. Junior Mike 
Bridenbaugh finished eighth 
with a time of 25:45.9, junior 
Geoff Misek finished 13th in 
26:03.2 and conference fresh
man of the year Breck Fresen 
was 14th, right behind Misek 
in 26:04.0. Irrer, meanwhile, 
led the team with a third-place 
finish in a season-best time of 
25:24.5.
We all knew what we liad to 
do, and we just went out there 
and did it, said Bridenbaugh. 
For us to come together and 
run our best means so much to 
everyone on the team. Winning 
conferences is something that 
Im sure will stay with, all of us
forever.
Its just amazing we had ev
eryone running so well on the 
same page, added Irrer. After 
some sub-par results, to do this 
in Nick and my senior year, and 
to have everyone clicking like 
this is so exciting. Now we just 
have to keep it up for regionals. 
The Tartans head to Dickin
son College next weekend for 
their regional race. The top three 
teams advance to nationals. The 
way were running right now, 
I think we have a good shot, 
said sophomore Doug Fricker. 
I think everyone is confident 
about our chances.
On the womens side, senior 
Jocelyn Sikora led the team with 
a twelth place finish in a time of 
23:08.9. She was followed by KJ 
Hilmstetter, who finished 32nd 
in 23:56.4, and Carrie Mallozi, 
47th. The Tartans finished sev

Volleyball wins 3 of 4 at UAA tournament
by Alex Horowitz
Junior Staffwriter
Playing in their second and fi
nal UAA round-robin tournament 
of the season, the womens volley
ball team took three of four from 
their competition at Washington 
University in St. Louis. With victo
ries against Brandeis, Case West
ern, and Rochester, the Tartans 
upped their conference record to
4-3, putting them in fourth place 
in the University Athletic Associa
tion standings. The teams final 
placing wraps up a fourth overall 
seed in the upcoming UAA cham
pionship tournament.
On October 15, the Tartans 
opened up their second UAA 
round-robin tournament with 
a four-game defeat of Brandeis 
University. Carnegie Mellon ini
tially dropped a game, but the 
team battled back to win the next 
three: 27-30, 30-27, 30-12, and 
30-14. The Tartans were later 
swept by Emory University, the 
third-ranked team in the nation. 
The match, though, was excep
tionally close, as each game was 
decided in a margin of four points 
or fewer: 30-26, 30-27, 30-28.
Going into the second day of the 
tournament, the Tartans stood at 
2-3 in the conference standings, 
and knew that a solid champion
ship seeding would require an 
outstanding performance on the 
last day of UAA action. Carne
gie Mellon met that challenge, 
winning both of their final two 
matches.
The Tartans first took a rela
tively close match from Case 
Western University in four
games: 30-21, 27-30, 30-27, 
30-21. Hours later, the Tartans 
dominated Rochester in a 30-25, 
30-23, 30-19 sweep.
Junior Catie Fisher led the 
Tartans tournament attack with 
66 kills, and also tallied 35 digs. 
Junior outside hitter Amanda 
Bradford and senior middle hit
ter Chrissy Bartek added 46 kills 
of their own, and combined for 
78 digs. Junior libero Kathryn 
Fox finished the tournament 
with 55 digs, and junior setter 
Brea Carlock recorded 165 as
sists and 18 digs. Also aiding in 
the Tartan victories were junior 
middle hitter Melena Yablinsky 
(18 kills), junior Alex Gutschick 
(19 digs), and junior middle hit
ter Becky Metier (39 kills). In the 
four matches, the team as a whole 
registered 28 blocks.
With her stellar performance 
at the tournament, Fisher was 
named a UAA Top Performer of 
the Week.
To go along with her kill and 
dig totals, Fisher featured an ex
cellent .395 hitting percentage 
during Carnegie Mellons 3-1 
UAA stretch.
The results of the two roundrobin tournaments determine the 
seeding for the UAA champion
ships, which take place November
5-6 at Brandeis University. Last 
year, the Tartans placed fourth in 
the eight-team bracket.
This year, with the two vic
tories against Case Western and 
Rochester, CMU finished their
2005 UAA tournaments with a 
4-3 conference record. Two weeks 
ago, in the first round-robin tour
nament at Case Western Reserve, 
the Tartans won one game but

Greenstein made a 41-yard field 
goal as time expired to secure the

Cross-CountrySenior Nick End 
recovered from a fall to finish 5th 
in the UAA championship. His 
result helped push the Tartans to 
their first conference champion
ship since 1989.
Dana Irrer, the teams senior 
captain, ran his best time of the
dropped two. Going 3-1 in the 
second tournament ultimately 
pushed Carnegie Mellon to fourth 
in the UAA standings, and landed 
the team the fourth overall seed 
in next weekends UAA champi
onship tournament.
After all seven round-robin 
games, Washington remained 
undefeated at 7-0, and Case 
Western winless at 0-7. The only 
three teams that finished ahead 
of Carnegie Mellon were Wash
ington, Emory (6-1), and NYU 
(4-3).
Since their final round-robin 
match, the Tartans have partici
pated in two tournaments that 
were not affiliated with the UAA 
standings. At the Juniata College 
Tournament (October 21-22), 
Carnegie dropped its first three 
matches against some of the topranked teams in the nation, in
cluding number-two Juniata and 
number-four NYU. The Tartans 
then rebounded to win their last 
match versus Franklin & Marshall 
in five games.
At the Wittenberg Invitational 
(October 28-29), CMU lost all 
four of its matches against highly 
regarded teams such as Wooster 
(Ohio), Alma (Mich.), Carthage 
(Wis.), and Wittenberg.
Despite their slow finish against 
non-conference opponents, the 
team ends with a 17-15 winning 
overall season record. Now, how
ever, all that really matters is its 
fourth-place finish within UAA 
play.
Next weekend, the fourthseeded Tartans will travel to 
Brandeis University to play their 
last match of the season in the 
UAA championships.
season and finished third at the 
UAA conference championships. 
Irrer, an All-American last year, 
will lead the team next week at 
the regional competition at Dick

finish in the top three to advance 
to the national competition.
VolleyballCatie Fisher led the

Big Als Metal Review
Roadrunner United: The All Star Sessions
Artist: Various You knew that Joey Jordison (Slipknot) was
a not-so-closeted death metal fan; I mean 
cmon, have you heard Iowa? But how 
about a track with Junkie XL? Matt Heafy, 
the 19-year-old wizard of Trivium, wears 
his 80s metal roots proudly on their debut. 
But a black metal fan? Yup. And how about 
Robb Flynn (Machine Head) recording the 
music for his hero, Max Cavalera? Sublime. 
Dino Cazares putting a little more Latin into 
the aggro of Chimaira and Devildriver? Its 
here.
Not only does this all work in the most splen
did of ways, there is also a sense that any of 
these songs could have been the jumping-off 
point for a solid album. In that spirit, Robb 
Flynns team is the most recognizable  all 
of his songs work in his trademark slicing and 
riffing. Getting Tim Williams, one of metals 
more underrated singers, to work with Flynn 
is a highlight of the album for me. Williams 
metallic howl matches the spirals of Flynns 
guitar work, and bringing Andols Herrick 
(ex-Chimaira) back behind his kit is another 
cause for joy. The guy needs to get back into 
a band  perhaps his music school training 
would work with the guys from V.O.D.
There are styles here that dont appeal to 
me, but an album like this should put forth 
all of Roadrunners history. Glassjaw and 
The Misfits arent my thing, but they are 
for a hell of a lot of people. The air on this 
album, as brutal as it is, is celebratory, as it 
should be. If you think you love heavy music, 
and you dont buy this album, youre lying to 
yourself.
Before I go, I want to send out heavy, heavy 
props to Joey Jordison for getting James 
Murphys guitar back into the public eye. 
One of the true musical geniuses of the 
metal genre, James has had serious health 
problems, but thankfully looks to be on the 
road to recovery. Please check out his story 
and work at msan thrope. com/jamesm urphy. 
Much love and respect to you, James.

Whats your metal dream team? If youre a 
fan at all, youve put some thought into it. 
Probably spent late nights looking for the 
infamous Black Zeppelin tapes online. Dave 
Mustaines side project with the guy from 
Fear? Yeah, you hated it, but you own the 
limited edition digipak, with the sticker, no 
less. If music fuels your existence, you cant 
help but wonder what would happen if you 
took parts of great bands and made a super
band.
Well, sometimes those dreams dont come 
true. But what if you took four of the best 
songwriters in modern metal, and gave them 
free rein to create whatever they desired? 
With whomever, too; the only catch would 
be that their collaborators had to have re
leased work on the trusted Roadrunner im
print. The result is a completely new album, 
with each of the four team captains, all on 
the Roadrunner roster, writing and record
ing new songs, not covers. The' performers 
they recruited for their team had to have 
released an album on Roadrunner at some 
point in the last 25 years to be eligible to be 
drafted. Thats the point of this album  it 
is a commemorative package to celebrate 25 
years of the labels existence.
A label only thrives if it loves the music it 
puts out  its clich, but continues to drive 
Roadrunners success. Its a love that works 
both ways, as todays heroes summon forth 
legends from the labels past on Roadrun
ner United. The result is one of the widestranging metal albums released to date.

50 YEARS AGO 
November 1,1955
Pitt challenged CMU to a very David-and-Goliath-esque contest. The Univer
sity of Pittsburgh challenged the student body of Carnegie Tech to direct com
petition in the annual Campus Chest drives to be held on the two campuses 
during this month, The Tartan reported. Okay, so it was a charity drive, but 
either way 1 think you can see why Pitt was likely to win.
-25 YEARS AGO 
October 28,1980
A writer protested that The Tartan had refused to print the F-word in his 
article. The connotations of the word f**k involve or imply sex; if you peo
ple are offended by the thought or mention of sex maybe you should turn off 
WRCT, stop reading The Tartan, drop out of college, and go home to the pos
sibilities of remedial puberty, the writer suggested.
10 YEARS AGO 
November 6,1995
Sometimes The Tartan prints really funny headlines. One headline about 
the Universitys future ambitions read: CMU focuses on endowment. In 
the story, The Tartan wrote, The endowment has become the focus of the 
Universitys efforts because its smaller than those of other schools. So thats 
why our school is so bitter towards the Ivy Leaguers.
5 YEARS AGO 
October 2,2000
As renovations were under way in Baker Hall, contractors found asbestos in
stalled in the floor tiles of the H&SS Academic Advisory office. The contrac
tors claimed that the asbestos was not a breathing hazard. Well, Ive got 
news for you - the asbestos is still there. You thought you got rid of it, but it 
just rolled down the hall to Porter. Im feeling wheezy. Hack hack. Oh look, a 
piece of my lung.

October 4,2004
Not surprisingly, five out of five kids polled at our liberal-loving college 
thought that John Kerry won the Presidential debates during the 2004 cam
paign. One student said that he didnt think Bush even knew he was at a de
bate. Other places Bush wasnt aware he was in: Afghanistan, Iraq, the Oval 
Office, McDonalds...

U2 rocks the Mellon Arena
A blend of classic hits and new songs, the concert offered something for everyone
Singer Bono pours his heart into his songs. The band has been making music for over 29 years and is still able to sell out concerts and pack stadiums all across the country.
 4----------------n;uu8X,s :. -BfX8Ow 'Ms
Rock band U2 has spent a large part of its 29-year career on the 
road, performing for sell-out crowds from New York City to New 
Zealand. Now veterans of the road and masters of their craft, 
the members of U2 have learned how to make their music more 
fresh, relevant, and meaningful than ever. After the confetti 
dropped, the champagne bottles popped, and the lights flashed 
peace signs, religious symbols, and flags of every country in the 
world, U2 had proven, as usual, that they are at the top of their 
game.
As the lights dimmed and the crowd went wild, guitarist The 
Edge, bassist Adam Clayton, and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. 
broke into the open riffs of City of Blinding Lights. Amidst the 
rain of confetti, lights, and cheers, Bono emerged in the middle 
of the arena, arms raised as he blew kisses to the crowd. It was 
going to be an awesome night, and the crowd knew it.
Whos ready for a Spanish lesson? Bono shouted as the band 
broke into Vertigo, a back-to-basics rock song with crunchy 
guitars and heart-pounding bass lines (you might have heard 
this song on iPod commercials), which led straight into 
Elevation, another new song in the bands rotation. After the 
first three songs, I was a little nervous that it would be a tour 
devoted to mostly new material. My fears were quickly put to 
rest when Bono began singing a cappella the opening lines to I 
Still Havent Found What Im Looking For. As the crowd began 
to sing along, the lights grew brighter and brighter, bringing the 
song to a pounding, glorious climax as Bono and company 
barreled their way through the edgy chorus.
group then asked a die-hard fan to play acoustic guitar on Party 
Girl. Bonos face showed a slight apprehension as the lanky, 
disheveled fan strapped up his guitar. But after The Edge and 
the lucky fan strummed through the opening chords, Bonos 
growl turned into a wide smile. I think this is going to turn out 
just fine, he said, much to the delight of the crowd.
After queuing up a drum machine over the loudspeakers, Bono 
and the group closed out the first encore with With or Without 
You, leaving the crowd, as expected, begging for more. The 
group came back once again to perform All Because of You 
and Yahweh. As the hour became late and the older crowd 
either went home to bed or sat down to mend their ailing knees, 
the ever-youthful group belted out one last cry of hope in 40. 
Bassist Adam Clayton switched with guitarist The Edge as Bono 
belted, with every drop of hope and optimism left in his body, I 
waited patiently for the Lord/He inclined and heard my cry/He 
brought me up out of the pit/Out of the miry clay/He set my 
feet upon a rock/And made my footsteps firm/Many will see 
and hear/I will sing, sing a new song.
As U2 continues to conquer the world, they leave in their 
path millions  billions?  of fans, worldwide adulation, 
and political, cultural, and religious unity. In the future, well, 
lets just hope they keep doing what theyre doing, cause hell, 
whatever it is, theyre doing it right.

Accompanying the music and extravagant stage setup  a 
circular platform that extended through the entire floor section 
of the venue (you can be sure that this promoted plenty of 
strutting), a lighting rig that could keep the entire city of 
Pittsburgh well lit, and movie screens above the stage  were 
Bonos charged political and cultural messages. During Miss 
Sarajevo, Bono blindfolded himself with a piece of cloth that 
had COEXIST written across it. Shining on the lights behind 
Bono were a cross, a Star of David, and other major religious 
symbols.
After belting through old hits like Sunday Bloody Sunday and 
the legendary Where the Streets Have No Name, Bono asked 
that the crowd to pull out their cell phones in attempt to turn 
the Mellon Arena into the Milky Way. The house lights were 
turned off and the stage lights glowed red; with the white spurts 
of light waving back and forth in eager anticipation, Bono 
spoke briefly about the ONE campaign, which Bono started in 
an effort to make poverty history. He was able to weave in 
and out of songs by using his political messages as transition 
points. By 2008, Bono said, more than five million people 
will have joined ONE. And thats more than the NRA, ladies 
and gentlemen. Naturally, Bono led the band into the fabulous 
One, with flags of every country scrolling through the sheet of 
lights that came down behind the band.
The band briefly left the stage, leaving the crowd in eager 
anticipation of at least another glimpse of the biggest rock band 
in the world. Re-emerging from backstage were Bono and The 
Edge, who performed The First Time as a duo, with The Edge

Kanye West touches the sky
Hip-hop pioneer comes to Pittsburgh and performs for a packed house
The University of Pittsburghs Peterson Events Center was filled 
to full capacity last Sunday, as college students and local fans 
came out to get a glimpse of hip-hop superstar Kanye West, 
who embarked on a nationwide college campus tour earlier this 
month.
West  who blew up in both the pop and hip-hop markets two 
years ago with his album College Dropout  builds his music 
on catchy vocal hooks, gospel and R&B samples, and of course, 
good rapping. His stage setup accommodated all of his own 
strengths  a string section, backup singers, a keyboard player, 
a DJ, and a percussionist.
Unlike other groups with a live backing band (The Roots, Outkast), Wests battery of 13 musicians all too often created a clut
tered musical context. The value of a string melody or bass line 
was frequently lost in the mix of excess musicians. In addition, 
the string sections harp player was hardly heard at all during 
the performance.
Seeing that the tour was dubbed the Touch the Sky Tour, it 
was only fitting that West emerged from behind a silk screen 
that covered the stage, singing, We gonna touch the sky to
night! West  dressed in a gray blazer and white aviators  
simply owned the stage. He jumped, screamed, sang, rapped, 
and danced. During We Dont Care, West encouraged the 
crowd to do just that, chanting, Throw yo hands up in the sky 
and sing We dont care what people say. 
If rappers are stereotyped for wearing big jerseys and baggy 
pants, West undoubtedly shattered such preconceptions. 
Changing outfits every three or four songs, West sported every
thing from khakis and a polo shirt with popped collar to tight 
blue jeans and a blazer.
After belting through fan favorites like Get 'em High and 
Jesus Walks  one of Wests first hit singles  he walked 
off stage and said, Alright now, when I play this next track, I 
need /all to scream so loud I wont even be able to hear the 
music! After hearing the opening notes of All Falls Down, he 
was deafened. West emerged from backstage sporting a white 
T-shirt with PITT scrawled across the front of it, sending the 
audience into even more of an emphatic frenzy.
After All Falls Down, the stage crew brought out a clothing 
rack and hung a GAP sign over the stage. West then invited 
Consequence to perform Spaceship, a song about struggling 
against racism and competition in the music industry. West
 dressed as a store employee  passionately belted out lyrics 
such as-Locked in a room for three summers/Doing five beats a 
day for three summers/I deserve to do these numbers.
Riding on the success of his hew CD, Late Registration, West did 
an excellent job balancing the new with the old. He played new 
tracks such as Gold Digger, which features Jamie Foxx im
personating Ray Charles, and Heard em Say, which features 
Adam Levine from Maroon 5. Neither Foxx nor Levine was pres
ent at the show, so West resorted to a pre-recorded tape. 
Although Wests performance was at times over-the-top, his
stage presence, style, and fabulous song writing made for a fan
tastic evening filled with confetti, props, and  surprise, sur
prise  a disco ball dropping during Wests last number, Dia
monds From Sierra Leone.
Towards the end of the show, Kanye mockingly dropped a screen 
behind himself scrolling negative criticisms of his music: De
spite all the hype, hes really not that good of a rapper and His 
music is excessive, and his lyrics are boring. Although some 
disagree, Wests supporters think of him as much more than just 
a producer and rapper  they think of him as a pioneer in the 
world of pop music.

International Festival
All about the upcoming Globally Green events, lectures, and concerts
So youre sitting around next weekend when you think 
to yourself, Hey, what happened to all those Glenn 
Close lookalikes from Homecoming last weekend? I miss 
them. But just when you thought CMU students would 
have a weekend free of outside visitors, Coordinator of 
Student Development Emily Half and company bring you 
the 2005 International Festival, a three-day extravaganza 
packed with enough diversity to rival any event ever held 
at 5000 Forbes Avenue.
The theme of this years festival, Globally Green: Cul
tural Perspectives and Environmental Issues, is shown in 
everything from the 200 flags that will soon adorn the 
UC to the trendy look-like-Davy-Crockett-chiseled-them 
wood pens being used around campus.
Packed with interactive workshops, lectures, and perfor
mances, the days of November 3-5 are being designed by 
a team to ensure an educational and engaging experience 
for the campus community.
The eco-friendly festival kicks off Thursday afternoon 
with a keynote lecture by Sy Montgomery, a conservation 
expert delivering an optimistic message of hope in the 
age of oil rigs and the Man destroying all things green. 
Replacing the eastern European subtitle party of Thursday 
nights is The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill, the true story
of a bohemian street performer and his troupe of wild 
red-and-green parrots.
Though held the same weekend as Family Weekend and 
an exciting opportunity for parents to see what happens 
on our campus, Half explained that the International 
Festival is geared toward the students. What should 
be specified, however, is that this festival will not appeal 
only to the resident PETA officials.
Take for example the Friday night highlight and keynote 
event, PHONK! Performed by Scraps Arts Music, this 
hyper-kinetic (that should appeal to you physics kids) 
performance is best described as Stomp meets the Blue 
Man Group, but cooler. Promising to stimulate all your 
senses, PHONK! is the perfect evening entertainment to 
cap a day of mentally stimulating lectures and a physi
cally stimulating international food fair.
Saturday continues a dizzying schedule with two or 
more events occurring at the same time, Half remarked. 
Students can listen to African folktales by Temujin the 
Storyteller in the morning and learn how to make re
cycled envelopes and notebooks in the afternoon. March 
of the Penguins, the second-highest grossing documen
tary of all time, will play in McConomy Auditorium that 
evening.
Replete with speakers from across all oceans, the Inter
national Festival also highlights the CMU faculty. History 
professor John Soluri and M. Granger Morgan of the de
partment of engineering and public policy are both hold
ing lectures during the Festival. The CMU faculty has con
tributed an unprecedented amount to the International 
Festival this year, Half noted.
The 2005 International Festival is going to make the UC 
look more like the UN this coming weekend. And even 
though Kermit the Frog lamented, Its not easy being 
green, this weekend and CMU is offering to share his 
burden.

" Globally Green " 
International 
Festival
This coming weekend marks the ar
rival of International Festival 2005, 
Globally Green: Cultural Perspectives 
and Environmental Issues. As a result, 
the Activities Board and Student Dor
mitory Council are ceding Thursday 
and Saturday nights to films (loosely) 
related to environmental problems. 
Interestingly enough, they are both 
about cute birds endowed with human 
qualities. Should these not appeal to 
you, theres always the Black Plague 
and troubled teenage boys. But not in 
combination.
The Seventh Seal
Wednesday, November 2 
@ 8,10,12
One of Ingmar Bergmans classics, this 
movie focuses on a Swedish medieval 
knight named Block who comes home 
from the Crusades to find his commu
nity ravaged by the Black Plague. Ap
proached by the Grim Reaper, Block 
challenges him to a game of chess on 
which his life rests. You wouldnt think 
a movie that features war, disease and 
religious violence would make for very 
many funny parodies, but tell that to 
Woody Allen (who used The Seventh 
Seal as the basis for his comedy Love 
and Death) and the writers of Sesame 
Street.
The Wild Parrots of 
Telegraph Hill
Thursday, November 3 
@8,10,12
Every major city has at least one ce
lebrity bird. New York has the famous 
red-tailed hawk Pale Male, and San 
Francisco has a population of displaced 
wild parrots, each of them named 
and known by a local homeless man 
named Mark Bittner. A vagrant musi
cian, Bittner doesnt have much else to 
do besides befriend these parrots, and 
his relationship with them sounds like 
it makes for an endearing, quirky little 
film. I certainly hope the poor guy got 
a good deal out of being the focus of a 
nationally released documentary. And 
the parrots too, for that matter.
March of the 
Penguins
Saturday, November 5 
@8,10,12
This is a movie of profound truths; 
namely, that penguins are kinder, 
smarter, braver, better parents, and 
better-looking than most people. Fo
cusing on the mating, breeding, and 
parenting rituals of the emperor pen
guin, the movie manages to capture 
the birds in an uncannily human light, 
without ever staging events or remov
ing them from their natural habitat. 
The result is a film thats pretty hard 
to find fault with. Hopefully you will 
come out of this film a better per
son; plus youll pick up handy tips for 
surviving in Antarctic conditions and 
avoiding hungry sea mammals.
Mysterious Skin
Sunday, November 6 
@8,10,12
No more birds; this movie is about 
boys, and quite a thought-provoking 
film it is. Brian Lackey, a young man 
living in Kansas, is convinced that pe
riodic blackouts during his childhood 
were alien abductions. In fact, he has 
unconsciously blocked out a number 
of childhood sexual experiences that 
he shares with Neil, a local teenage gay 
hustler. Dont be deterred by the fact 
that Neil is'played by Joseph GordonLevitt, previously of Third Rock from 
the Sun fame. This movie is a welcome 
antidote to the over-the-top Will & 
Grace portrayal of gay men, and it has 
the international awards to prove it.

Artist connects with audience
Soulful singer and recent Stanford graduate Vienna Teng tells the stories behind her lyrics

Vienna Teng is a master of performance skills beyond 
the merely musical. The young singer gave a successful 
concert to a packed house at the Carnegie Museum of Art 
Theater on Friday, October 28. She performed 15 songs, 
including some from her past two albums as well as new 
songs that she is practicing. Some of the songs included 
Erics Song, Gravity, Nothing Without You, and 
Mission Street.
Her performance invited the audience into her world as 
she discussed the background of each song before play
ing it. Teng took the time to give the audience an inside 
look at the inspiration behind the songs, some of which 
are like confessions while others are more narrative. She 
also lightened the mood with a variety of humorous sto
ries. She was very interactive and gave two encores that 
members of the audience requested. For the second en
core, she invited members of Soundbytes, an a capella 
group at CMU, to come up on stage and sing one of her 
songs with her.
Her remarks were well-tailored to the college audi
ence. Teng herself is not far removed from college: the 
26-year-old singer studied computer science at Stanford 
and worked for Cisco Systems for two years as a software 
engineer before she decided to pursue a career in music. 
She described her success as the rarest of gifts.
Teng has a rather low-key, mellow style of music similar 
to that of Sarah McLachlan. Normally, she performs her 
songs with other instrumentalists, including a drummer, 
violinist, and cellist; but she accompanied herself on a 
keyboard, as well. For this concert, she accompanied her
self fluently on a keyboard. Her voice is rather low and 
velvety, but she has a higher range. Unfortunately, her 
voice is very one-dimensional. She had very little vibrato 
despite an abundance of long-sustaining notes. All of her 
songs were at this low key level, something that she ac
knowledged, saying, I dont really write fast, perky, up
beat songs. But these next few songs are my attempt to up 
the energy level. Her attempts were still very similar to 
what we had heard before. While her songs do accumu
late poignancy and pathos, she needs more variety in her 
repertoire.
Teng has two albums so far. As she explained to the audi
ence, she finds that she needs time off from touring to 
write new songs. She told the audience, I want to de
velop what Im doing [music] and get better at it. She 
thinks that each new album will be better than the last. 
She also cherishes her roots in classical piano, which she 
studied from the age of five through her senior year of 
high school. Also, the violinist and the cellist with whom 
she tours were conservatory-trained. They often give Teng
music to listen to and sparked her interest in the music of 
Claude Debussy, and in particular his gorgeous string 
quartet. As for other kinds of music, she tries to listen to 
artists that are different from her. She is a fan of Outkast, 
Radiohead, and Coldplay.
Tengs music used an expanded harmonic palette to in
crease the range of emotions present in her music. There 
was a lot of interaction between what she was singing and 
what she was playing on the keyboard. She is talented at 
thinning out the volume of sound to consist only of her 
singing accompanied by single notes played in the higher 
registers of the keyboard, rather than chords. These are 
very quiet moments which make you afraid to swallow 
because you think the noise will ruin the moment.
Tengs appearance was sponsored by the Awareness of 
Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC) organization. Van
essa Shyu, the president of ARCC, said, Were trying to 
change our image and find a balance between serious 
Chinese culture and broader appeal. I-ting Ariel Wang, 
the vice-president of ARCC, added: Theres not that 
many Chinese-American performers. It would be a good 
chance for people to learn about another aspect of Chi
nese culture. I feel her background, being at Stanford for 
computer science, is similar to CMU students. I think it 
would be interesting to see what compelled her to change 
to music.

The Rise of CyberConXion
How a couple of MBAs are trying to bring gaming to Pittsburgh and the rest of the world
Daddy, God loves me; he brought me to CyberConXion.
This is Larry Hochendoners favorite memory of his work 
at CyberConXion. A little boy invited to a birthday party 
at the Pittsburgh gaming center gasped in amazement 
when he saw the console gaming room at the back of the 
building, outfitted with four projectors, each hooked to a 
Nintendo Gamecube, a Sony Playstation 2, and a. Micro
soft Xbox. For a kid, this was gaming heaven, and as he 
cried out in pure joy, the adults in the group all laughed. 
This place was not for them  it was for their kids.
parties for people out of his and their own homes us
ing multiple computers, but over the years the idea kept 
growing.
This business is about social [izing]. Its not about the 
technology. The technology just happens to be there.... 
This is all about social. Thats where a lot of  Ill say 
90 percent of our competitors dont get it, said Hochendoner. Hochendoner, who earned his MBA from the Uni
versity of Pittsburghs law school, handles most of the 
technical side of the business.
Behind the Business
Leon Edelsack and Larry Hochen
doner have a business plan. The two 
met when working at Westinghouse 
in 1990. While Hochendoner was 
born and raised in Pittsburgh, Edel
sack only came to Pittsburgh in 1979 
as a graduate business student at 
Carnegie Mellon. Both men now call 
the city home.
While this fact certainly had a bear
ing on their final choice of location, 
it did not begin here. The idea for 
CyberConXion has been gelling in 
Edelsacks mind for years. He used 
to play games like the seminal firstperson shooter Doom at home with 
his son, and quickly found that gam
ing was simply more fun with other Students of all ages log in on the computers at the CyberConXion Caf in Squirrel Hill, 
people. He started running small _______________________________________________________________
over, CyberConXion has carved itself a niche that allows 
it to offer a unique experience. Weve taken it to a new 
level with the ambience, with the computers, with the 
style of the workstations, with the chairs, with the light
ing, with just the little things that you dont see in any 
other place. And the safety, said Hochendoner. Its a 
very family-oriented neighborhood. The safety of the 
neighborhood makes it easy for parents to support the 
center as a good activity for kids  they dont have any
thing to worry about.
A little something for everyone
With many public and private schools in the immediate 
area of Squirrel Hill, the presence of a 12-and-up clien
tele is not surprising. What is surprising, according to Ho
chendoner, is the way they congregate. They come in, 
in twos and threes and fours, but then three or four will 
show up in addition to that; so its a meeting place.... This 
is a destination.
Parents, of course, love CyberConXion. Michelle Mul
len, whose two sons are regular patrons at the gaming 
center, is thankful that Edelsack and Hochendoner have 
opened up shop here in Pittsburgh. Its safe, its clean, its 
well attended, and these guys can control what the kids 
watch, Mullen said. Its not all about games, though;
Mullen noted that sometimes she 
will send her son to CyberConX
ion to work on school projects if 
hes having trouble concentrating 
at home. The staff can lock down 
a computer so it can only access a 
word processor, cutting out distrac
tions and making homework easier 
to complete.
Edelsack recalled another time 
that his business had shown that 
gaming was a powerful driving 
force. One of his regular custom
ers, a 13-year-old girl with highfunctioning autism, loved playing 
The Sims.
The mother was having quite a 
difficult time with her completing 
a project at school, he said, and 
the girl just didnt want to do it
 it was a book report. The girl fi
nally came and said, Look. Ill do 
this project if youll let me go to 
CyberConXion for an hour.
As these two Pittsburgh businessmen continued to per
fect their business plan and solidify their goals, the idea 
of CyberConXion took shape. As Edelsack was putting the 
pieces together, he realized that he had in fact stumbled 
upon an idea that could work. Lets do something differ
ent and take the disciplines that we learned in big com
pany business and try to do it in an industry thats frag
mented and generally unmanaged or poorly marketed, 
try to bring some business discipline  and in Larrys 
case technical discipline  to an area that we could prob
ably make some money in, he recalled thinking.
So far their venture has paid off. CyberConXion has cre
ated a reputation for itself as being a safe, reliable, and 
supportive place for people to come and have fun. MoreSince it opened on December 3,2004, the CyberConXion 
gaming center in Squirrel Hill has been attracting guests 
of all ages for parties and tournaments, as well as for com
puter training and education in media creation. The cen
ter is located in the building at the corner of Forbes Av
enue and Murray Avenue, near the center of the Squirrel 
Hill shopping district. It takes up 3700 square feet on the 
second floor, above the now-defunct Zyng Asian Grill.
Pittsburgh CyberConXion is the largest public access com
puting facility in Pennsylvania that offers PC and console 
gaming. With 65 top-of-the-line PCs and 12 console 
systems, all connected together in one'big network with 
Internet access and more than 25 individual PC games to 
choose from, not to mention dozens of console games, 
its a treasure trove of gaming right 
in our backyard. Yet most students 
have never even heard of it.

The girl went back and in an hour and a half had written this book report. The mother, almost in tears, calls up and relates what happened, saying this was absolutely, bar none, the best piece of homework shes ever done in her life, and it was well written, well thought out now, youre talking about 13, but given her capabilities the mother was just overwhelmed. They had dinner, she brought the child here for an hour and a half  the girl was completely engaged. The parents feel so comfortable that this girl can come here and have a tremendous experience, and they use it as a reward mechanism, and she was so in tears  its so powerful a motivator that it would drive her to that.
And then there are the parties. Overall, the big picture is birthday parties have just exploded on us. Its not because of the games, its because of simplicity, Hochen- doner said. Theres a value, the number that we can do concurrently  we thought we could do two at a time but weve proven that we can do three at a time, which is great for us.
The nature of middle-school friendships means that this trend is growing; parents see their children go to parties hosted at CyberConXion and want to do the same for their own children, who get jealous if Timmy Smith has a cool computer party and they dont. Edelsack remembered fondly the night that he and Hochendoner ran two parties simultaneously, and how it exemplified why these parties are so popular: They were absolutely engaged in competitive and cooperative multimedia entertainment for a two hour period of time, and the parents said this was probably the least amount of work theyd ever had to do  they had nothing to do, basically  and they said this was absolutely superb and they said while it wasnt inexpensive, they felt that for the amount of kids they had interacting, it was good value for their money.
While parties and middle-school-aged children are gaining CyberConXion a great reputation and building its foundations as a successful business, Edelsack and Hochendoner have yet to truly penetrate a very important demographic: college students. The Oakland-Shadyside- Squirrel Hill area of Pittsburgh is full of members of the collegiate crowd from every imaginable background and with every imaginable set of interests. Many of those students are huge fans of computer games. However, most college students who are hardcore gamers will have their own setups and their own friends they play with on the university network for free.
College students who are casual gamers, the ones who might wander into CyberConXion on a Thursday night
Justin Brown/Photo Staff
Carnegie Mellon students are beginning to frequent the cafe, 
especially for gaming competitions.
out of boredom and play a game of Dance Dance Revolution or maybe drop in for a Counterstrike match or two, are not going to want to pay $7 to do it. This is especially true for the over-21 crowd, where $7 an hour can buy you enough drinks to get up the courage to talk to that cute girl in the corner before she gets up and leaves. You can only take one choice or the other: girls and booze or terrorists and Bawls. Unfortunately, the draw of girls and booze usually wins out.
The other problem is somewhat self-perpetuating. College students tend to group together; this concept needs no real explanation. Everyone does it, including high schoolers who happen to be one of CyberConXions biggest groups of clients. College students generally dont want to hang out with a bunch of high school kids, especially in a situation where they might have to interact  like a gaming center, for instance. Even though the center is equipped with several individual rooms that can be (and are) cordoned off for small groups of players to sequester themselves from the rest of the customers, many people still think that a gaming center is just for giant dorks and pubescent boys.
But what about adults? How do they benefit from a 3700- square-foot public computing facility in one of the oldest and culturally richest neighborhoods in Pittsburgh?
The staff at CyberConXion is in the opening stages of offering hands-on computer training for adults, similar to the program they currendy have for young girls. The plan is to offer group training for computer applications like web design, digital photography, and other multimedia
endeavors. Edelsack has already seen difficulty getting the program into motion, but he is also already working on a solution. The problem has been getting a group together all at the same time, and the other problem is that most of these people who are older adults want individual supervision or theyre uncomfortable being with a group; how were going to resolve that is were going to take groups that have natural affinities, like temples, where theres a womens group at the temple, or churches, or things like that, where they already interact, and thats how well hit the adult market, so theyre comfortable already together, he said.
The tides are slowly changing. Parents with tech-sawy kids are now often being ever-so-slighdy drawn in to their childrens world  a person, any person, can only watch a game for so long before becoming fascinated with it, if only subconsciously. Its clear to Edelsack that parents are becoming more interested. If theyre women it tends to be they engage on things like DDR. If theyre men, it could be console games that are typically sports games in the back [on the consoles], or some of the first-person shooters and strategy games on the computer systems. So its one, a function of the gender of the parent and two, the age of their children, and how many there are, he said.
As the appeal of gaming spreads and evolves, Cyber-ConX- ion will be evolving with it to attract new customers and keep their old ones. They will continue to try attracting college students, and are extending, through the end of the year, a 40 percent discount on hourly rates if Carnegie Mellon students mention this article and the code ZXN- FAJA.
The Friday night crowd at CyberConXion will continue to be a motley crew of gamers and people just looking to have fun. One quiet Friday night saw 13-year-olds playing the newly released shooter Day of Defeat: Source on the centers PCs, while in the back, a group of high-schoolers were giggling hysterically as their friends played Dance Dance Revolution. A girl named Sarah lay on one of the green, benchlike sofas, staring intently as two of her friends stood, moving their feet around on command with the music. She had never been to CyberConXion before tonight, but she already understood why her friends came here week after week. Its chill. I like the couches, she said, still entranced.

Sex, school, and your student body
Sex kills. Come to CMU and live forever.
The brothers of SAE were given many accolades across campus 
for their slogan Sex kills. Come to CMU and live forever. The 
sad truth of the matter is that when groups of CMU students 
get together, sexual frustration is second to classwork on the 
neverending stress list.
Contrary to popular belief, this school should be big enough 
to meet someone else. Theres whats-his-name down the hall 
playing Halo and DDR all day, every day, and I know that if I just 
walked over and knocked on his door in a trench coat and some 
lingerie, I might prove SAEs slogan wrong. On second thought, 
he probably still wouldnt take the hint; I would probably need 
to show up to his door naked as a jaybird. That is, of course, 
after I did some incredible espionage and inflicted irreversible 
damage to his Playstation (because we all know that whats-hisnames first priority is to fix the damn thing). But is the situation 
that desperate?
What if this lack of lovin is simply a part of CMU culture? Are 
we so nerdy that we cant find (or rather, make) the time to have 
any kind of  gasp  intimate relationship? I know that our 
school is considered to be exceedingly intense, but wouldnt you 
think that our intensity in the classroom, gym, or at DDR could 
translate into intense relationships?
After all, a little lovin here and there could help us focus and 
release some of that pent-up tension, right? Although one could 
argue that going to the gym would achieve many of the same 
goals, sex is a great alternative to burn some calories, and if 
youre lucky, you may not even have to leave your desk. Perhaps 
during the Orientation sex talk there should be an extended 
section on the benefits of relationships and sex in addition to 
the other information provided.
For the 95.5 percent of students not having sex on a regular 
basis, there are some big questions that need to be asked. If so 
many people are sexually frustrated on this campus, why do we
Jimi Okelana/Art Staff
refuse to do something about it? It seems that instead of taking 
some action, people would rather commiserate together and 
join angry Facebook groups, proving the age-old saying misery 
loves, company. Unfortunately for most people, the company 
refuses to turn on some Barry White while conveying their woes.
Oh, I almost forgot  do you know who Barry White is?
Get it together! Were overworked nerds and probably need sex 
more than other people, anyway. Lets review the facts: Most of 
us are intense people, and this intensity has spilled into most 
other aspects of our lives. But for some unknown reason, it has 
not spilled into our sex lives. We are headstrong and ambitious, 
so why should our sex lives be anything less?
So what is to be done?
1. Turn off the damn Playstation (I guess you can save your 
game first).
2. Quit DDR; in fact, do you see those dumpsters behind Donner? 
Thats where you should throw your pad.
3. Brush your teeth.
4. Say hello to that person you have been eyeing in class (they 
just might have a trench coat or a Barry White fetish).
5. Next time you are at Hunt studying organic chemistry, take a 
study break with the Kama Sutra.
Seriously, if we put half as much effort into our relationships as 
we do into the time we spend studying, that saying might slip 
away.

HOROSCOPES.
BY JACKIE BROOK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): This week will be a struggle as temptation will 
act as a driving force. Monday will lure you into debauchery  perhaps stealing 
candy from small children. Wednesday will entice you to cheat on that exam 
you didnt study for on Tuesday since you were hung over because of all the 
Halloween parties and candy-stealing you did Monday. Saturday will leave you 
wanting to steal your roommates ID card so you can do free laundry. I say raise 
hell and give in to them all.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Oh, youre quite the bull. Or rather, youre full 
of bull. Whats with juggling the ladies, men? And dont think youre not guilty, 
girls. Stop stringing those boys along, get your act together and pick one person 
to fool around with. Halloween is for spreading mischievous cheer, not VD.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): With Mars guiding the Twins, there seems to be 
some issues at hand. Work or play? Heart or mind? Vodka or rum? Don't worry; 
you cant go wrong no matter what you choose. Well, you can. Youre just too 
stubborn to admit it. So let loose and have fun... white your parents are still 
willing to pay for it.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): You have crabs. And not the chocolatey kind 
wrapped in red or orange foil.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Lions are fierce and majestic and strong. You are 
not. Get up the courage to seize what you most desire. Unless it involves a 
weird latex fetish, in which case you should just get up the courage to seek 
help. Sicko.
VIRGO {August 23 - September 22): I dont give advice to virgins.
LIBRA (September.23 - October 22): Your scales of justice are slightly off 
balance this week as you try to juggle personal and professional relations. 
Maybe you should have thought about that before trying to sleep with your 
superior and the incriminating photocopies were leaked to the office.
SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21): For some of you fine Scorpios, you will 
be turning 21 this week. I see in your future: vomit, police reports, and an angry 
roommate. Good luck with that.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): The stars are showing me that 
its your fault, Sagittarius, that Christmas has invaded the sanctity of our pagan 
Halloween. In due course, Venus seems to be aligning with Saturn to ruin all 
your holidays until Christmas. Wish a fond farewell to Diabetic Eye Disease 
Month, the opening of Perus Bullfighting Season, All Saints Day, Sandwich 
Day, Election Day, Veterans Day, Mickey Mouses birthday, and Thanksgiving.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Capricorn sounds like candy 
corn," and, as we all know, nothing bad ever happens to candy corn. Except for 
the fact that no one really likes it and that its more often used as something to 
throw at siblings rather than as the sugary treat it was intended to be.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You were hoping that little cutie 
from Pitt was going to give you some action, right? Unfortunately, throwing up 
those Jell-0 shots all over your $8 homemade costume didnt make the best 
impression. Id recommend crawling into a ball and dying.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You were a fish for Halloween. Real original. 
Asshole.
