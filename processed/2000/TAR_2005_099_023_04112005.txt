In addition to the federal 
governments involvement with 
funding education, in the 1950s 
a public debate raged about how 
children should learn to read. 
The publication of Why Johnny

pedagogical method: phonics.
It was in this context that Dr.

Students 
under fire 
from RIAA
i2hub users at risk
by Alex Meseguer
Layout Manager
Everyone does it  very few get 
caught, said one of up to 40 Carnegie 
Mellon students who are being tar
geted by letters of intent to sub
poena from the Recording Industry 
Association of America (RIAA). 
These students may be forced to face 
the music and pay thousands of dol
lars in fines if a subpoena finds its 
way into their campus mailboxes.
The quoted student, who wishes to 
remain anonymous for legal reasons, 
has consulted a lawyer in anticipation 
of the possible subpoena. However, 
there is a possibility he might not 
even need an attorneys services.
We dont know if any or all 
subpoenas will be served, said 
Joel Smith, chief information offi
cer for Computing Services. Smith 
said the University forwarded the 
notice to give students a chance to 
explore their legal options. Also, no 
student who received the pre-sub
poena notice has been disciplined 
by the University. Carnegie Mellons 
response to copyright infringement is 
generous compared to other Internet 
service providers, said Smith. Most 
ISPs are pretty draconian about it. 
However, said Smith, some schools 
do not impose any sort of retribution. 
We take more action than some of 
our peer institutions.
The University has made available 
an employee at Student Activities to 
answer any questions students who 
received the notices may have.
The notices are the latest in a series 
of actions against other high-profile 
schools in the last month, includ
ing one at Princeton University. 
According to the Daily Princetonian, 
39 students there have recently been 
served with letters of intent. The 
RIAA has also targeted Columbia, 
Harvard, Texas A&M, and the 
University of Southern California. 
The last time CMU was targeted sub
stantially was in 1999.
The anonymous student said he 
has multiple file-sharing programs 
on his computer but uses only one, 
i2hub. i2hub is file-sharing software, 
also known as peer-to-peer, which 
uses Internet2, a private alternative 
network providing electronic access 
to 207 universities around the coun
try. The program is often attractive 
to students because it allows down
loading at speeds far beyond what 
students can get even on high-speed 
campus networks.
He says his only mistake was gen
erosity. I usually never share, but I 
felt generous one week and I shared 
one of my hard drives one week on 
i2hub for 4-5 days and boom, it hap
pens. Just got unlucky, said the stu
dent. Before any of this happened, 
he thought i2hub was relatively safe 
from the prying eyes of the RIAA 
because it was a private network, but 
did not feel completely immune. I 
realize there is no 100-percent safety 
in anything. I knew there was a risk 
involved, he said.
Under the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act passed by Congress 
in 1998, he could be fined anywhere 
from $750 to $150,000 for each viola
tion, depending on the circumstanc
es of the file-sharing. For example, 
a typical 20-gigabyte iPod can hold 
about 5000 songs. If you assume that 
just a tenth of the songs on that iPod 
were illegally downloaded, a lawsuit 
could cost the owner $75 million. 
Most lawsuits are settled out of court 
for $10,000 or less.
Despite the possibility of heavy 
fines, the student does not find any
thing wrong with sharing files and 
believes sharing the files with his 
friends is fair use under copyright 
law.
The RIAA tried to gain access to 
Internet2 through official chan
nels last fall, according to the Daily 
Spectator, Columbia Universitys stu
dent newspaper. The article in the 
March 29 edition of the Spectator

Next year, sorority Kappa 
Alpha Theta will trade their 
residence on Margaret Mor
rison Street and become the 
first sorority neighbors of 
Pi Kappa Alpha and Kappa 
Delta Rho on the fraternity 
quad. Kappa Alpha Theta 
has accepted an offer from 
Housing to move into the 
residence vacated by Delta 
Tau Delta last semester.
This move is the most 
recent of several major 
changes to the fraternity 
quad, which include the 
creation of Forbes House 
in Kappa Sigmas former 
house, the vacation of DTD, 
and the recent announce
ment that Delta Upsilon will 
lose its house for one year 
starting this fall.
Neither the University 
nor the students want to see 
an empty house thats that 
large, and which is support
ive to such a large chapter 
community, said Greek 
Council President Erin 
Weber, referring to DTDs 
former home, 1077 Morewood Avenue.
Weber, a senior BHA major 
with concentrations in de
sign and psychology, added 
that It will be a nice transi
tion for the Greek commu
nity to increase communica
tion between the fraternities 
and the sororities.
According to Director of 
Student Life and Greek ad
visor Renee Camerlengo, 
Housing owns the residence 
and extended the offer to 
all of the sororities on cam
pus. The selection process, 
Camerlengo stressed, was 
completely random and in
volved Kappa Alpha Theta, 
Delta Gamma, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma, and Delta Delta 
Delta. Kappa Alpha Theta 
was, in Camerlengos words, 
picked out of a hat.
Greek housefellow Mon
ica Bebie stated that Kappa 
Alpha Theta accepted the 
opportunity with the full 
support of their advisor 
Kim Nolder, as well as the 
national organization. 
Nicole Saulnier, a senior 
in electrical and computer 
engineering and the Presi
dent of Kappa Alpha Thetas 
CMU chapter, said We felt 
there was enough support 
from within our house [to 
accept the offer]. Kappa 
Alpha Theta currently has 
64 active members; Saulnier 
said the sorority plans on 
housing roughly 28 sisters, 
leaving enough flexibility to 
accommodate 32.
Weber believed Housings 
choice to give DTDs former 
residence to a sorority rather 
than make it first-year hous
ing might be due to the fact 
that almost all the sorori
ties are large enough to fill

and Housing. His new position 
will extend his purview over 
student development and cam
pus life without all the day-today tasks associated with the 
Dean of Student Affairs.
I will, in this new role, be 
taking on a variety of projects 
and initiatives still very much 
involved in student life, but at 
what might be seen as more of a 
strategic level, Murphy said.
Murphy began working for 
Student Affairs at the Univer
sity almost 25 years ago. At the 
time, Carnegie Mellon was a

Contributing Editor
Over 15 years, more than 
25,000 students have called Mi
chael Murphy Carnegie Mellons 
Dean of Student Affairs. On 
Wednesday, that changed when 
the University announced that 
Murphy will be promoted to the 
position of associate vice-presi
dent. The position of associate 
vice-president did not previ
ously exist at the University.
Murphy previously oversaw 
Student Activities, Student Life,
a place that had a lot of hard 
edges: There was an 18 percent 
attrition rate between the first 
and second years at the Univer
sity. Murphy says it was his task 
to create a warmer climate on 
campus.
When I took the ombudsman 
job, it was clear that students 
wanted to step up to greater 
leadership opportunities on 
campus, particularly out of the 
classroom and that was the cor
nerstone, Murphy said. The 
opportunity for students to feel 
that the campus was their own 
was a critical part of that foun
dation. So we looked into ways 
we could be supportive of those 
opportunities.
Associate Dean of Student Af
fairs Jennifer Church will be fill
ing Murphys job in an interim 
capacity until a permanent 
choice is made on a new dean. 
The job will be open during the 
2005-2006 academic year. My 
goal is that I have time to well 
serve the student population 
and that the community is as 
vibrant a place with me in this 
interim role as it has been with 
Michael in this role, Church 
said.

Pulitzer-prize-winning author 
Louis Menand  one of the great 
public intellectuals in the nation
 used Dr. Seuss rhymes to ex
plore Cold War cultural theory 
on Wednesday. And as both an 
English professor at Harvard and 
a staffwriter for The New Yorker, 
he wasnt fooling around.
Menands lecture, titled The 
Cat Who Came in from the 
Cold, kicked off the second an
nual Humanities Center Lecture
 a three-day-long conference 
on The Humanities and Exper
tise. The conference featured 
over a dozen speakers from nine 
universities and discussed topics 
ranging from The Humanities 
and Sciences to From Critique 
to Vision.
CMU English Professor Jeffrey 
Williams introduced Menand, 
noting that while Louis Menand 
has been celebrated as one of our 
finest public intellectuals, he 
also remained his own private 
intellectual as someone whose 
work did not fall into conven
tional categories. Williams then 
shared with the audience stories 
from when Menand had been his 
composition instructor at Colum
bia University.
The anecdote appropriately 
framed Menands lecture, which 
sought to analyze the culture of 
Cold War America through the 
lens of a cultural historian with a 
touch of personal encounter and 
wit.
He began by speaking on the 
federal funding of cultural means 
in the name of national defense. 
The federal government, he said,
Harvards Louis Menand details how the beloved childrens book The Cat in the 
Hat was actually a government effort to help children read in the Cold War.

New pope must

Cardinals say
Before entering secrecy 
while selecting the next pope, 
the Roman Catholic Cardinals 
have hinted at the ideal profile 
of the future pope. According 
to the prelates, the pope must 
continue the grassroots inter

Also in line with John Paul 
II, Cardinals say that the new

with universal appeal. Cardi

Presidential perspectives: Election results yield solid leadership
JErik Michaels-Ober
I was extremely happy to see so many 
students vote in last weeks student body 
elections. Over 2150 total ballots were 
cast. Tom Sabram was elected Student 
Body President and Nicolette Louissaint 
was elected Student Body Vice-President. They will take over at the end of the 
month, when my term is officially over.
I am looking forward to transitioning 
the office to Tom and Nicolette. I have 
worked with both of them over the past 
two years in Student Government and 
know them both to be hard workers, 
dedicated to improving our campus. I am
confident that they will expand upon this 
years successes, as well as implement 
innovative ideas of their own.
Student governments finances will be 
in the very capable hands of Student Body 
Vice-President for Finance-elect Nicholas 
Scocozzo. Nicholas and I worked on Stu
dent Senate for two years together, and 
we worked very closely this year, when he 
was Student Senate chair. Nicholas expe
rience working with student organiza
tions suits him well to this new position.
Congratulations to all of the students 
who won seats in the Student Senate 
election. The full results of the election, 
including all 37 seats of Student Senate, 
can be seen online at elections, andrew. 
cmu.edu.
The undergraduate newspaper fee ref
erendum passed by a ten percent margin. 
This means that national, regional, and 
local newspapers will be made available 
to undergraduate students starting next 
semester. I hope that this will increase 
students awareness of the events going 
on in the world around them.
I am also pleased to report that, fol
lowing the forum held on April 1, the 
University has decided to incorporate the 
Graduation Pledge of Social and Envi
ronmental Responsibility with this years 
commencement exercises. Graduating 
seniors who are interested in signing 
the pledge this year should look for the 
table set up in Kirr Commons on April 22, 
Earth Day.
Finally, the Joint Funding Com
mittee has made final recommenda
tions for all student organizations 
budgets for the next academic year. 
As required by the Student Body 
Constitution, their recommenda
tions have been published online at 
budgets.stusen.org. Members of the 
Undergraduate Student Senate and 
the Graduate Student Assembly will 
vote on these recommendations on 
April 20 at 5 pm in McConomy.

Spring semester begins with be
low freezing temperatures and over
cast skies. Students seem to hibernate 
through the first half of the semester, 
and the campus feels like a vacant lot. 
Spring break comes and goes, making 
way for the stressful final push of the 
semester. For nearly 90 years, Carnival 
has been the saving grace of spring se
mester.
But the feel of Carnival doesnt seem 
quite the same as it was at its peak, 
as conveyed by old issues of The Tar
tans Spring Carnival special edition. 
Frankly, some of the most negative as
pects of our community express them
selves in our present Spring Carnival.
The celebration was born as Class 
Day in 1914, and was a merger of sepa
rate programs from each of the four 
colleges of Carnegie Institute. The day 
included a Band Concert, Spreads, 
Three Performances, and a Decorated 
Campus, as announced on the front 
page of the June 11,1914, issue of The 
Tartan.
In 1919, Class Day was expanded 
into Campus Week, a long-weekend 
event resembling todays festivities. 
In 1920, the Campus Week commit
tees ran an extensive advertising 
campaign throughout the whole of 
Pittsburgh.
Nine years later, the event was fail
ing again; in 1928, local police raided 
dorms to quell widespread disorderly 
conduct. President Baker cancelled the 
celebration, and Campus Week 1929 
was nothing more than Sweepstakes: 
But after the market crash in October, 
the administration considered propos
als for restoring Campus Week for the 
sake of campus morale. With the con
sent of the administration, Carnival was 
given its familiar name in May 1930, 
ironically during Prohibition. Drink
ing was already manifesting itself as a 
problem and The Tartan editorialized 
to remind students that sobriety would 
be necessary for retaining the event.
Carnival changed little over the next 
25 years: Sweepstakes and a float pa
rade anchored the events, except dur
ing World War II when materials were 
at a premium. The format was so in
grained that there was campus outcry 
at the elimination of the float parade 
after 1954 as it was replaced by small 
frame structures immediately nick
named booths. Booth, as it came to 
be called, was more popular than cam
pus expected, but by 1968 this new for
mat was again stale, and students filed 
complaints that Carnival was no longer 
a meaningful part of campus life.
The next year Carnival came back 
strong, with mass campus-wide plan
ning and new emphasis on intricacies. 
This effort in spring 1969 has grown 
into the current mindset of Carnival. 
But the spirit of the 1969 Carnival is 
nowhere to be seen today.
Once a light-hearted change of pace, 
marked by genuine enthusiasm for in
novation, Carnival is now marked by 
spendthrift competitiveness and an un
healthy enthusiasm for intoxication.
Every day, CMU students, with ever
growing course loads, battle for the 
highest scores in hopes of beating ev
eryone else for the top-paying entrylevel job. As it is, Carnival is more of the 
same. Booth-builders spend a full week 
and tens of thousands of dollars to beat 
out other teams. On move-on night, 
members of some teams cheered as half 
of AEPis booth collapsed to the ground.
All the while, too many students 
consume inordinate amounts of alco
hol as a means of further escape. Too 
many fraternities have already been 
given warnings  or the boot  for al
cohol violations. It is not unreasonable 
to worry that, between the quad and 
Beeler Street, we may be heading in the 
direction of the late 1920s. Rather than 
letting Carnival continue to degenerate, 
next year let us remember Carnivals 
history and restore the enthusiasm and 
creativity that has been the foundation 
of its most successful years.

RIAA targets student 
i2hub users
SUBPOENAS, from A1
raised the question of how 
the RIAA was monitoring 
activity over Internet2. 
Columbia said it didnt 
know.
Jenny Engebretsen, 
a representative for the 
RIAA, declined to comment 
on any part of their actions 
against Carnegie Mellon 
students.
In the original letter of 
intent sent to Carnegie 
Mellon, a lawyer for the 
RIAA said the notice was 
being issued because many 
Internet service providers 
were requesting advanced 
notice of any legal action.
However, some see the
letters as nothing more 
than a scare tactic used 
in lieu of actual lawsuits. 
To me, it sounds like say
ing hey, we know youre 
there but were not going 
to do anything because we 
have 10,000 other cases... 
The intent of the lawsuits 
is to scare people, wheth
er they are professionals 
or students, and to deter 
them from using file-shar
ing networks, said Jorge 
Gonzalez, co-founder of 
zeropaid.com, an informa
tion portal for file-sharing 
software. [The pre-sub
poena letters] are more of 
a slap on the wrist than 
anything.

RESULTS, from A1
the Presidential race remained 
in dispute and were eventually 
overturned, this years election 
proceeded without major inci
dent.
The only votes that remained 
in dispute were three paper bal
lots, which were probably hand
ed in by fifth-year scholars, said 
Scocozzo.
In the Presidential elec
tions, there were a number of 
eclectic write-ins in addition to 
the featured candidates. These 
included perennial candidate 
Optimus Prime, who received 
27 votes (the pairing of Optimus 
Prime and Megatron received 
one vote) as well as several 
votes for Pedro, a reference 
to the character from the movie 
Napoleon Dynamite. Write-ins
in the Senate elections included 
the character Strongbad from 
www.homestarrunner.com, the 
late Pope John Paul II, Meatwad 
from the television show Aqua 
Teen Hunger Force, and the 
entire Ford Motor Company. 
In the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, students voted 
for over 300 Senatorial candi
dates.
Overall, candidates viewed 
the campaign process as a posi
tive experience. Campaigning 
was an amazing experience, 
since it allowed us [Nicolette 
and me] to meet and talk to so 
many members of the campus 
that we didnt know, said win
ner Tom Sabram. This experi
ence will be invaluable to us, 
and any future leaders of stu
dent government, because we 
will be able to more accurately
represent the entire student 
body.
Rachel Gross also praised 
the number of voters who par
ticipated. It is always great to 
see students involved  I hope 
that voter turnout keeps grow
ing and that people make sure 
their voices are heard.
Her running mate, Benjamin 
Hackett, agreed. However, 
he stated his disappointment 
in the choice students made. 
While I am disappointed that 
the University chose to contin
ue the standard internal pro
motion from within a flawed 
student government system, I 
am pleased with the turnout 
and activity surrounding the 
election. It has always been 
my desire to promote progress 
through debate. Thanks again 
to those who supported us.

duce the children to their libidos

book, he said, also deals with a 
repressive, castrating fish that 
represents order in the face of de
sertion by the childrens mother 
representing great themes of the 
late 50s: abandonment, trans
gression, and deceit.
In addition to an intellectual 
analysis of the work, Menand 
talked about his own personal re
lation to the book, noting that it 
was The Cat in the Hat that taught 
him how to read. Menand himself 
said that he always identified with 
the fish, feeling supportive of the 
zaniness represented by the cat 
but uninterested in participating.
The audience present, com
posed mosdy of professors, re
ceived the talk with what seemed 
to be great enjoyment. Timothy 
Haggerty, associate director of the 
Center for Arts and Society said 
that Louis Menand is a leading 
public intellectual of cultural his
tory. I enjoyed the talk very much. 
While Menand had published re
lated essays in The New Yorker, he 
confirmed after the speech that 
this was the first time he had ever 
given this specific talk.
The Humanities Center is di
rected by English Professor David 
Shumway, who not only intro
duced Louis Menand on Wednes
day, but also spoke before the 
first panel on Thursday, a discus
sion on What are the Humani
ties? Shumways talk followed 
a trend that would be repeated 
throughout the conference: an 
analysis of both the history of the 
humanities and the state of the 
humanities within the modern 
university.
Menands lecture also transi
tioned from historical analysis to 
a discussion of modern culture at 
the end. Now we have the idea 
that anything goes, without the 
spirit. Cakes on rakes are every
where; a thousand cats cavort for 
our attention; even the fish has 
been co-opted. Menand finished 
the lecture with the same force 
that he had maintained through
out: Mother is not coming back 
this time. Its just us and that god
damn cat.

that part of the works beauty lies

220 unique words set to anapestic dimeter: a simple work whose 
strength killed the pre-phonic 
textbooks of Dick and Jane.
Having discussed the cultural 
elements at play in 1957, Menand 
provided an overview of intellec
tual history, discussing the intrica
cies of contemporary works such 
as Chomskys Syntactic Structures 
and Levi-Strausss Structural An
thropology. Menand spoke with 
ease on cybernetics, information 
theory, structuralism, and linguis
tics throughout his lecture.
Menands breadth of knowl
edge on cultural and intellectual 
history and his ability to explain 
complicated theory framed the 
ultimate object of his talk, The Cat

the culture of Cold War America.

Lecture attendance 
reflects popularity 
of string theory
by Sean Conroy
Junior Staffwriter
There are few geeks who dont 
know Brian Greene. Through his 
books The Elegant Universe and 
The Fabric of the Cosmos and a 
recent NOVA special, the Co
lumbia professor has succeeded 
in making string theory, a math
ematically complex hypothesis 
describing the universes small
est particles, not only accessible 
but popular.
Greene spoke about string 
theory last Monday to an en
thusiastic audience as part of 
the Drue Heinz lecture series 
at Carnegie Music Hall. In the 
audience were more than 80 
physics students from the CMU 
physics department, which 
sponsored their admission tick
ets. The turnout is reflective of 
the popular appeal string theory 
has achieved, especially among 
physics enthusiasts.
To many of these students, 
the possibility of contributing 
to string theory seems unattain
able. After all, Brian Greene was 
a child prodigy, able to multiply 
30-digit numbers at the age of 
five, and was being privately tu
tored in math by a professor at 12. 
There are already several pro
fessors on campus dabbling in 
string theory, including CMU 
physics professor Richard Hol
man, who described Greene as 
the King of Cool.
The study of string theory 
is not limited to those with 
PhDs. This semester, profes
sor Ira Rothstein inaugurated 
an undergraduate course titled 
Introductory String Theory. 
Rothstein said, I heard from a 
friend of mine at MIT that they 
were offering the class for their 
undergrads, so I figured, if their 
students can handle it, then so 
can ours. Although initially en
rollment was quite high, Roth
stein said, many of the [stu
dents] found it overwhelming; 
about half have dropped out 
since the class began.
I wanted to make the class 
real string theory, not a watered-down version of it. Im 
very proud of the students who 
have persevered. They are very 
enthusiastic, said Rothstein.
Asked if the class would be 
offered again, Rothstein re
sponded, That depends upon 
whether the department has 
the manpower for it.
String theory is the cutting 
edge of theoretical physics, and 
breaking into the field is very 
difficult. One of Rothsteins 
students, senior physics major 
Peter Battaglino, hopes to pur
sue string theory in graduate 
school and is aware of the chal
lenges.
The only way I can survive 
the competition is to be ob
sessed with the subject. I know 
that its going to be frustrating 
at times, and ridiculously diffi
cult all the time, and the only 
way that Ill be able to cut it is 
to be 100 percent devoted, 
said Battaglino.
Rothstein said of Greene, He 
has done some important work 
in string theory. But I think its 
fair to say that hes really not a 
leader in the field. Neverthe
less, professor Greene does 
seem to have a unique ability to 
explain the theory. Battaglino, 
who also attended Greenes 
lecture, said, I was amazed at 
how clearly he managed to con
vey the cutting-edge content of 
his field.
Greene defined string theory 
as an attempt to answer one of 
the great questions in science: 
What is the most fundamental 
component of matter? Greene 
said that in the widely-ac
cepted Standard Model, quarks 
and electrons are the most fun
damental particles of the uni
verse. In contrast, string theory 
states that the most fundamen
tal things are strings: tiny 
vibrating filaments of energy. 
Greene explained that just as 
different vibrations of a violin 
string create different musical 
notes, different vibrations of an 
energy string produce different 
particles. Every piece of matter

Stallman preaches free code
Tree software proponent evangelizes moral opposition to licensing

Richard Stallman doesnt take 
kindly to long introductions. 
As a representative of the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh chapter of 
the Association for Computing 
Machinery recited a laundry list 
of thanks to all the people who 
had helped to bring Stallman 
to speak on Free Software: 
Freedom and Cooperation last 
Thursday in the Benedum Engi
neering Hall, the man himself 
was hopping on one leg, bare
foot, up and down the aisles 
of the auditorium. Laughter 
rippled.
The founder of the Free Soft

his eccentricity. At his appear
ance Thursday, he asked wheth
er anyone in the audience had a 
parrot. I like meeting friendly 
parrots, Stallman said. He 
closed his talk with an appear
ance as Saint iGNUtius of the 
Church ofEmacs.
But more than his eccentric
ity, Stallman is known for his 
iconoclasm. This is the man 
who practically single-handedly 
started the Free Software move
ment in the 1980s with his aim 
to create an entirely free and
open operating system.
So. What is free software? 
began Stallman. Free software 
is software that respects the 
users freedom. When Stall
man says his software is free, 
he doesnt mean it costs nothing 
(though that is true). He means 
that the software protected by 
the GNU General Public License 
(GPL): a licensing agreement 
that, in its own words, is in
tended to guarantee your free
dom to share and change free 
software  to make sure the 
software is free for all users. 
There are four essential kinds 
of freedom Stallman recog
nizes: First  freedom num
ber zero, as he calls it  is the 
freedom to run the program. 
Second is the freedom to look 
at the source code, and to make 
changes for your own use. These

How Things Work: Coastal Formation
William Nicoll
Soon, summer will arrive. 
Many will spend their summer 
at the beach, tanning on towels, 
body-surfing the breakers, or en
joying a game of barefoot volley
ball. We often take our beaches 
for granted, though: Before you 
curl your toes into the warm 
beach sand or run splashing 
into the water, take a moment to 
partake in the wonderful world 
of coastal formation!
Coastal formation occurs on 
several scales, ranging from the 
motions of the planets all the 
way down to the interactions of 
molecules of water. On the larg
est scale, coastlines are formed 
from two processes: coastal 
emergence and coastal submer
gence. Coastal emergence hap
pens when land emerges out of 
the water. This can occur, for ex
ample, when a mountain range 
at a plate boundary is uplifted. 
Imagine the coastline of Chile, 
closely paralleled with the An
des Mountains. Millions of years 
ago the Andes were pushed up 
from the crust, forming a new 
coastline.
Far more coastlines, however, 
have been formed by submer
gence. Coastal submergence oc
curs when the water level of the 
ocean rises significantly, flood
ing formerly inland regions. The 
entire east coast of the U.S., for 
example, is a coast of submer
gence. The majority of todays 
coastlines are of this type be
cause of the rise in sea level fol
lowing the last Ice Age.
Beach formation on a more 
familiar scale deals with ac
tual aggregate movement. Put 
simply, the Sand Mans day job 
is to shovel beach sand  a lot 
of beach sand. The movement

of beach sand happens in two 
ways  the movement of sand 
perpendicular to the beach and 
the movement of sand along 
the beach. Both are caused by 
a combination of wave motion, 
water currents, and wind.
Sand movement toward 
and away from a beach is de
pendent largely on the type of 
wave. Waves known as spilling 
breakers, or constructive waves, 
tend to have elliptical pipes that 
surge water up on the beach, 
depositing sand and dissipat
ing the waves energy. Plunging 
breakers, or destructive waves, 
tend to have a circular pipe that
collapses in on itself, sucking 
sand away from the beach in a 
backwash and contributing en
ergy to the following wave. The 
occurrence of these waves is 
dependent largely on seasonal 
variation and weather.
Currents also have a signifi
cant effect on the movement of 
sand in and out from the beach. 
If waves are responsible for the 
movement of sand on and off the 
beach, then currents are respon
sible for the movement of sand 
to and from the waves. Imagine 
a grain of sand being taken away 
from the beach. As this grain is 
swirled about in a tempestuous
Alejo Grigera / Art Staff
fury of foam and churning wa
ter, it is eventually picked up by 
a current known as a rip current 
or rip tide. These rip tides fun
nel outward between underwa
ter sand bars until they die out 
with increasing depth.
The grain of sand will then 
drift towards the sandbar, set
tling down on it until it is picked 
up by an incoming wave. That 
wave will eventually deposit 
on the beach, repeating the 
cycle. Because rip tides only 
occur between breaks in under
water sandbars, they dont have 
enough force to cause a net 
movement of sand away from the
beach. (If youre ever stuck in 
a riptide, swim parallel to the 
beach and youll soon escape 
its deathly grasp! If you want to 
avoid a tour of Neptunes inky 
depths, remember my column!)
Another type of current, 
known as long-shore drift, is 
responsible for the movement 
of sand parallel to the beach. 
Long-shore drift occurs because 
waves often strike beaches at an 
angle. When they do this, the 
waves deposit sand along one 
direction and pull it away on an
other. This tends to form a zig
zag movement of sand along the 
edge of the beach, pushing sand 
in the direction that the waves 
are striking. This movement is 
responsible for the formation 
of several coastal structures, in
cluding spits, hooks, tombolos, 
and coastal bars. For more in
formation on these terms I in
vite you to consult a dictionary.
This drift has important con
sequences for the man-made 
development of coastal regions. 
Because of this effect, many 
beaches worth billions of dol
lars in property value would dis
appear as sand is slowly moved 
down the coast. To counteract 
this, many coastal towns have 
built structures called groins 
along their beaches. Groins are 
basically walls made of con
crete, wood, or most commonly, 
piles of rocks. These walls proj
ect out into the water at regu
lar intervals and stop the longrange movement of sand.
Water can be our friend, but 
it can also be our mortal enemy. 
The continuing development of 
many coastal regions is akin to 
building your house on a sea
side glacier. Sure, it may look 
stable now  but eventually its 
going to fall into the sea.

Early hominid cared 
for elderly kinsmen
A new fossil uncovered in 
Dmanisi, Georgia, suggests ancient 
hominids may have fed and cared 
for their elderly. The 1.77-millionyear-old specimen, described in 
Nature magazine, was completely 
toothless and well over 40  quite 
an old age for the time. The fossil 
reveals that the hominid had lost 
most of his teeth well before his 
death. He would not have been 
able to chew the raw meat or 
fibrous plants that made up the 
creatures normal diet. Therefore, 
his brethren must have cared for 
him, feeding him the choice, soft 
morsels. This may suggest that 
the creature lived in a complex 
society that was capable of show
ing compassion. Unlike the tallstanding, big-brained Homo erectus, Dmanisi hominids were short, 
small-brained, thin browed, and 
probably dragged their knuckles 
along the ground like apes.

Simulations solves 
galactic mystery
Astronomers Noam Libeskind 
and Carlos Frenk, from the 
University of Durham, have used 
the Cosmology Machine super
computer to show how a series 
of small galaxies surrounding the 
Milky Way could take on a pan
cake form. Theorists originally 
believed galaxies should have a 
diffuse, spherical arrangement. 
Six simulations carried out on the 
machine not only came up with 
the correct number of satellites 
but also showed the same pancake 
arrangement seen in the Milky 
Way. Noam Libeskind now plans 
to conduct further simulations to 
investigate how common the for

really is.

Evidence reveals 
animals laugh too
Professor Jaak Panksepp, of 
Bowling Green State University 
in Ohio, says that animals other 
than humans exhibit play sounds 
that resemble human laughs. 
These include the panting sounds 
made by chimps and dogs when 
they play and chirping sounds 
observed in rats. This statement 
suggests that laughter may be a 
very ancient emotional response 
that predates the evolution of 
humankind, says Panksepp. 
Professor Panksepp explains that 
neural circuits for laughter exist 
in very ancient parts of our brain, 
the general structure of which is 
shared by many animals.

in the universe  every atom and 
every molecule  is composed 
of identical strings that are sim
ply vibrating at dif- ________
ferent frequencies.
This is string theory 
in a nutshell, and re
markably, it resolves 
many conflicts within 
physics, such as the 
incompatibility be
tween quantum me
chanics and general
relativity. --------------
In spite of the hype 
surrounding the theory, Greene 
admitted, string theory is un
proven. But he remains optimis
tic that experiments will someday 
offer proof. For example, string
theory predicts that colliding 
gravitons lose some energy, which 
escapes to one of a number of par
allel universes. The opportunity 
to test this prediction may come

when the Large Hadron Collider, 
a groundbreaking experimental 
particle physics facility located 
near Geneva, Switzerland, comes 
online. If the measurable energy
of colliding gravitons is smaller 
than predicted under the Stan
dard Model by the amount string 
theory predicts, this would be a 
confirmation of the theory.
_______ String theory could
lead to profound 
revelations about 
the character and 
composition of the 
universe. Of course, 
the concept that ev
erything is made of

has convinced many scientists 
that string theorists are on to 
something.
Open-source icon lectures at Pitt
STALLMAN, from A4
two freedoms are concerned with 
helping yourself, according to 
Stallmans taxonomy.
The third freedom is the free
dom to help your neighbor, 
namely by copying the program 
from your computer to his. The 
final freedom in Stallmans list is 
the freedom to help your com
munity, by taking your own 
modifications and releasing them 
to the public as new versions of 
the software.
Stallman views proprietary 
software as an evil, and not even 
a necessary one. If free software 
respects the users freedom, nonfree software tramples it, by for
bidding users to help each other. 
Each non-disclosure agreement a 
programmer signs, in Stallmans 
view, amounts to a blank check 
of betrayal.... By the time you find 
out who youve betrayed, its too 
late.
One CMU student in the audi
ence, sophomore CS major Mat
thew Wright, said, I agreed with 
pretty much all he said.... I was 
surprised how much he spoke his 
mind.
Near the end of th lecture, 
Stallman stated his opinion that 
all schools should use free soft
ware exclusively. As usual, he had 
a list of reasons for his view. First, 
free software is cheap. Schools, 
Stallman said, should not spend 
taxpayers money on permis
sion to use unethical [i.e., nonfree] software. Second, schools 
have a duty to educate society 
in a healthy direction. Stallman 
drew parallels to the marketing 
of cigarettes in the 20th century: 
corporations today give away 
educational discounts and 
gratis copies of their software 
in the same way that cigarette 
companies used to give out free 
cigarettes in schools  in order 
to produce a fresh generation 
of addicts. Todays schoolchil
dren are not addicted to nicotine; 
theyre addicted to Microsoft and 
Adobe and Mulberry.
Third, Stallman said that 
schools should use open-source 
programs for the sake of educa
tion. When a student asks, How 
does this program work?, its 
not educational to reply I dont 
know, or Im not allowed to

Free Software Foundation president 
Richard Stallman, pictured above,

Pittsburgh last Thursday.

tell you, or Its a secret. Free 
software solves this problem by 
letting bright young students in
vestigate computer programming 
on their own terms. Finally, of 
course, Stallman believes schools 
should use free software because 
to do any less would be evil. Stall
man suggested the following rule: 
If you bring software to class, you 
must share it with everyone. 
Anything you can do with a free 
program, you can do with a nonfree program. This is an ethical 
distinction, not a technical one, 
said Stallman, both consistent
and strident in framing the free 
software debate in moral terms. 
But Stallman did not neglect the 
practical side of the issue. A big 
part of the IT market is the techni
cal support business, he said, and 
if a customer buys a proprietary 
program such as Microsoft Word, 
that customer is then tied down 
to Microsoft; whenever a bug is 
discovered or the program needs 
maintenance, its time to petition 
Microsoft for a fix. And competi
tion alone doesnt fix the prob
lem; whether youre petitioning 
Microsoft, Oracle, or Google, the 
essential situation is the same.
Freedom is not just the free
dom of choice, Stallman intoned. 
Freedom means having control 
of your life. The choice between 
proprietary programs is the abil
ity to choose your master. Free
dom means not having a master. 
Stallman mentioned other 
practical aspects of free soft
ware, including its immunity to 
spyware and back doors: Since 
anyone can see the source code 
at any time, theres nowhere for 
such malefactors to hide. He fin
gered RealPlayer and TiVo among 
prominent spyware hosts, but 
didnt forget to mention that the 
biggest spyware program of all 
is one you may have heard of... 
Its called Microsoft Windows. 
(Stallman mentioned a rumor 
that the Indian police, back in 
2001, had fingered a handful of 
Microsoft employees as al-Qaeda 
operatives trying to sneak a secret 
back door into Windows XP.)
But Stallman isnt fear-mongering; hes evangelizing. He repeats 
again and again that free software 
isnt good because its less buggy, 
cheaper, or better for the econ
omy (due to the competition in 
tech support already mentioned), 
or less risky (because its impos
sible to pirate). Its good because 
its free, according to Stallman.
How much non-free software 
do you have on your computer? 
he asked. If we want to live in 
freedom, weve got to get that 
number down to zero. Thats a 
massive undertaking, one that 
many people have called idealis
tic and impractical. But Stallman 
is forever the optimist: When 
youre trying to do something big, 
theres nothing more practical 
than idealism.
Harvard law professor predicts GPL 
will divide open-source community
LICENSE, from A4
cent of the GPL, he is vocally op
posed to one particular aspect: its 
restrictions on derivative works.
U.S. copyright law, said Vet
ter, is designed to protect the 
rights of creators by restricting 
certain actions on the part of the 
consumer: namely reproduction, 
the creation of derivative works, 
distribution, and public perfor
mance or display. For example, a 
person who buys a John Grisham 
novel is not allowed to make a Xe
rox copy of the book, because its 
copyright statement forbids any 
unauthorized reproduction.
OSS uses copyrights restric
tion on reproduction to keep its 
source code open. As the copy
right holder, a programmer has 
the right to forbid certain kinds 
of copying of his work. Open 
source licenses simply forbid any 
copying that would be used in 
closed-source programs.
Free-software licenses take ad
vantage of the second copyright 
restriction as well as the first.
Paragraph 2b of the GNU GPL 
states: You [the licensee] must 
cause any work that you dis
tribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains or is derived 
from the [protected work] or any 
part thereof, to be licensed as a 
whole at no charge to all third 
parties under the terms of this 
License. In other words, the GPL 
forbids the creation of any deriva
tive work that would be used in a 
closed-source program. This is 
what Vetter calls the infectious 
part of the GPL.
Why is this clause so worri
some? Vetter offered some ex
amples of products which might 
be considered derivative works, 
if they were ever tested in court. 
For instance, any program writ
ten for the Linux operating sys
tem which contains calls to sys
tem routines (such as the ones 
for displaying text on the screen) 
can be called derivative. When 
Linus Torvalds released Linux 
under the GNU GPL, therefore, 
he wrote in an exemption for sys
tem calls.
Kernel-mode device drivers are 
another kind of software threat
ened by paragraph 2b. These pro
grams in some sense become part 
of the Linux kernel in order to 
do their jobs; if the aggregate is 
perceived as a derivative work, 
then all its parts  including the 
device drivers themselves  are 
legally bound to release their 
source code under the GPL.
So the GPL spreads itself across 
the software landscape, infect
ing what it touches. In response, 
Vetter said, there has been a sig
nificant backlash in the commer
cial world. Scared of losing their 
code to the careless inclusion of a 
GPLd tool or library, some com
panies, including Microsoft, have 
taken to including an anti-GPL 
clause in their own licenses, for
bidding the inclusion of that code

RIAA leverages power to exploit 
students financial situation
During the past week, the Recording 
Industry Association of America (RIAA) 
has served Carnegie Mellon with over 
30 letters of intent to subpoena. These 
letters demand that the University sup
ply the RIAA with the names and per
sonal information of students who have 
been found to be violating copyright law. 
Once these subpoenas are served, it is 
likely that the students in question will 
have action taken against them.
Whether or not the RIAA intends to 
follow through with its legal threats re
mains to be seen, but Carnegie Mellon 
provides little protection for students 
targeted by the RIAA or the Motion Pic
ture Association of America (MPAA). 
In an e-mail sent out to the Carnegie 
Mellon community last week, Vice-Provost for Computing Services Joel Smith 
stated that, If you are engaged in illegal 
use of copyrighted materials ... and the 
University receives a proper subpoena 
asking for the name of the person who 
registered the computer being used for 
such purposes on the Carnegie Mellon 
network, we are legally obligated to sup
ply that name. The result may well be 
that the RIAA or MPAA will take legal 
action against you. There is nothing the 
University can do to shield you from 
such action.
Students cannot expect the University 
to get in the way of legal proceedings. If a 
subpoena is correctly served, the school 
is legally bound to provide students 
information, even if they protect stu
dents privacy in other cases. However, 
the idea of performing massive checks, 
or sweeps, in colleges for file-sharing 
seems to be a gross abuse of power on the 
part of the RIAA. Are they really looking 
for massive file-sharing operations, or 
are they just out to scare people?
This get tough on copyright infringe
ment attitude doesnt really help any
one. It targets a few students who are 
forced to come up with money during 
one of the most financially stressful 
times of their lives, and it doesnt pre
vent other people from uploading or 
downloading files.
With one of the highest yearly college 
tuitions in the United States, CMU puts 
its students at a very high risk, should 
they be forced into a lawsuit with the 
RIAA. It seems that most students who 
are subpoenaed settle (as there is no 
record of a case actually making it to 
court), unable and unwilling to take 
such a case to court. When the fact that 
most students do not have a disposable 
income is taken into account, the average 
settlement for file-sharing is staggering. 
According to Joel Smith, the fine per 
song may range anywhere from $750 to 
$150,000. The latter value is equivalent 
to roughly four years of our tuition. This 
amount is absurd considering the songs 
in question retail for 99 cents on iTunes.
If a student has Kazaa or other simple 
file-sharing software on their computer, 
and is suddenly sent an e-mail notifying 
them of an impending subpoena, they 
are put in a terrible position. With one 
fell swoop, aside from worrying about 
grades, students find themselves worry
ing about finding a lawyer, with or with
out the help of their parents. As they 
scrape up cash for tuition, room, and 
board, theyve now got to worry about 
money for a setdement, not to mention 
legal fees.
The fallout peer-to-peer sharing seems 
unreasonable. All this trouble simply 
because students downloaded The Postal 
Services Such Great Heights to replace 
their scratched CD.
How does the RIAA see any justice 
in that?
Giving credit where credits 
due: congrats, Dean Murphy
At the beginning of next year, Dean 
Murphy will be no more. His tide will 
be replaced by Associate Vice-President, which is decidedly less catchy. 
His tide has become a part of his iden
tity, and a look back over the past 
15 years shows how much of a difference 
he has made in this position.
Fifteen years ago, Carnegie Mellon 
was a very different place. Not only was 
student retention low, but students also 
had a very different relationship with the 
University. The idea that Student Affairs 
would work with students did not ex
ist; the school didnt particularly engage 
student organizations. Dean Murphy 
changed that relationship in a funda
mental way.
As Dean of Students, Michael Mur
phy always saw himself as an educator 
with the job of empowering students. He 
could not be further from the cartoonish representations of University deans 
that we see in movies such as Animal 
House, in which a graying, Machiavellian 
dean plots to undermine students. Even 
today, Murphy continues to see his job as 
one that allows students to take greater 
ownership of their college experience.
It is no wonder, then, that his promo
tion has caused such a flood of congratu
lations not only from those in Warner 
Hall, but from students as well. Simi
larly, individuals from outside CMU have 
acknowledged his work. A few years ago,
when the Higher Education Research 
Institute acknowledged the changes that 
have occurred at Carnegie Mellon, Dean 
Murphy was one of the few individuals 
singled out for his role.
Few people realize that Dean Murphys 
desire to improve the student experience 
goes beyond the time he spends in his 
office. He was recendy awarded a PhD 
from the University of Pennsylvania for 
his research on the metacurriculum, and 
plans to continue this research at the 
postdoctoral level.
So whether we call him Dr. Murphy, 
Mr. Vice-President, or just Michael, there 
is no denying that this man has cre
ated great changes on campus, and all 
for the better. It is hard not to feel that 
the students are losing something as he 
moves up the Warner Hall hierarchy, 
but we remain hopeful that he will be as 
accessible in his new position as he has 
been for the past 15 years. While it will 
be hard to say goodbye to Dean Murphy, 
we have a lot of faith in Jennifer Church 
to continue his work in the next year, and 
perhaps beyond.
Looking back on the past 15 years 
makes it hard not to appreciate what Dean 
Murphy has done. The Tartan has been 
accused of being too pro-administration 
in the past, but we are not ashamed to 
give credit where credit is due. Thanks 
to a hard-working staff member for 15 
years of dedicated service.

Guns at CMU
I am president of the Rifle and 
Pistol Club. Unlike Mr. Greenberg, I 
own firearms, I shoot them regularly, 
and I carry firearms on my person for 
defensive purposes at all times except, of 
course, when going about my business 
on campus. Mr. Greenbergs editorial 
contains factual errors that betray an 
admitted lack of experience with fire
arms. However, I presently have space 
to address neither these errors nor the 
concerns I have about the carrying and 
possession of deadly weapons on cam
pus. Instead I address the main point of 
Mr. Greenbergs editorial.
I do not question the Universitys 
wishes for its own property, but the 
weapons policy does present me 
a major difficulty. I am legally enti
tled to possess a pistol in my home.
I am licensed to carry a pistol on the 
Commonwealths streets. However, I 
am forbidden to have a pistol on cam
pus. Therefore when traveling to cam
pus I may be armed at the beginning 
of my trip and during my trip, but 
what am I supposed to do once I get 
there? This difficulty is compounded 
by the frequency of violent attacks that 
occur in the area of campus and seem 
to target college students. Because of 
the Universitys policy, I am disarmed 
when I am most likely to be the object 
of violent aggression.
We in the Club would like to see the
University accommodate those in similar 
situations. An amendment to the weap
ons policy ought to be made to allow in
dividuals to secure their weapons once 
they arrive at campus by locking them 
in their vehicle. Additionally, in the late 
90s, William Kaiser, then a sergeant 
with CMU-PD, implemented a proce
dure to store weapons with campus 
police. If this policy were resurrected, 
it would have the double benefit of ac
commodating pedestrians who carry 
weapons for personal protection and 
giving those who live in University hous
ing a secure location to store weapons. 
We believe that the institution of these 
two policies would provide a reason
able balance between the Universitys 
interests in pursuing a safe community 
and individuals interests in pursuing 
their own safety.

Misleading allegations
In Alex Meseguers call for making 
Joint Funding Committee (JFC) delib
erations public [Bring secret funding 
process into the light, 4/4], he wrote, 
Some JFC members recalled an in
cident when the baseball team came 
to the appeals meeting wielding base
ball bats. Quite the intimidating situa
tion; the committee would have been
well within their rights to call Campus 
Police.
This is a gross misrepresentation of 
an event that took place years ago, 
when the Baseball Club asked Student 
Senate for a special allocation to 
replace damaged equipment, including 
bats. During a Senate hearing on the 
allocation, members of the Baseball 
Club passed around cracked bats and 
other equipment that was no longer 
suitable for use in practice or games.
No member of the Baseball Club, 
past or present, was contacted to con
firm or deny this damaging claim. In 
2001, then-Baseball Club president 
Nick Naviglia chaired the JFC. For the 
past three fiscal years I have personally 
liaised with the JFC and, contrary to 
the implied bullying, have not so much 
as appealed the JFCs recommended 
subsidy for two of those years.
All this begs the question: What 
exactly are these JFC members 
recalling? If it is hearsay of an event 
years prior, exaggerated as passed 
down from committee to committee, 
it should be reported as such. Instead, 
the incident was reported as fact, 
which it is not. I implore The Tartan 
to be more vigilant in its fact checking 
and representation of organizations 
and events.

Alexandra Kilduff
Last week, as Carnegie Mellon stu
dents voted for next years Student 
Body President and Vice President, 
they may have run into some unex
pected problems  the online voting 
page crashing, for example. Or perhaps 
they discovered that they were unable 
to read the platforms for some of the 
main candidates, and were therefore 
completely unaware of the positions of 
these potential leaders. Maybe, when 
they were asked to vote on a referen
dum that could approve a $5 fee for a 
collegiate newspaper program, they no
ticed that the facts about the program 
were wrong, including the title. If they 
returned to the page later, they might 
have noticed the referendums descrip
tion had changed completely, or even 
disappeared.
If they followed misc.market, they 
would have noticed a nasty e-mail 
disparaging one of the candidates on 
the grounds of racism. They might 
have received an e-mail through their 
academic departments telling them to 
vote for so-and-so  a clear violation of 
Computing Services guidelines.
Its possible that the average student 
wasnt much aware of or upset by these 
discrepancies in the voting system. But 
for a school that prides itself on its 
good judgment and expertise, the fact 
that the Student Body Elections Board 
couldnt get their facts straight or keep 
their candidates in line  especially 
after weeks of preparation  is embar
rassing.
The student body elections process 
may not seem like a big deal to most 
students, but for those who are in
volved in it, its seen as an enormous 
undertaking  perhaps a little too enor
mous. Chancing by the third floor of 
the University Center one late evening, 
you might run into 11  count them:
11  people from various student orga
nizations putting together one  count 
it: one  poster to advertise the stu
dent body debates. Preparations go on 
for weeks, and in an effort to coordinate 
these preparations, Student Senate ap
points an Elections Chair, who is des
ignated to keep the elections fair and 
orderly.
Despite appearances, this task 
shouldnt be all that hard. Why is it, 
then, that this years Election Chair 
not only failed to clearly outline ethical 
campaign practices for the candidates 
but also couldnt ensure that the web
site was clear and factual?
During both the presidential and 
Senate candidates campaigns, several 
unfair campaigning practices occurred 
that the Elections Chair could have 
dealt with in a more expedient and 
fair manner. A post on misc.market 
listed a link to a poem attributed to 
presidential candidate Rachel Gross, 
apparently designed to portray her as 
a racist. Immediately, other presiden
tial candidates were assumed to be the 
culprits. Furthermore, Senators defied 
Computing Services policy by e-mailing 
their departments to promote them
selves. The Elections Board and Elec
tions Chair appear to have taken only a 
passive stance on this behavior, rather 
than actively dealing with it.
Come the actual time to vote, there 
were still mistakes to be found. Stu
dents who went to the voting site to 
cast their votes electronically found 
that candidate platforms could not be 
seen. The description of the newspaper 
referendum was not correct. The site 
later had to be changed.
As a member of a newspapers staff, 
I fully understand that mistakes can 
be made. I will also concede that 
compared to last years election, this
one went off very smoothly. However, 
there is no reason to see mistakes or 
unethical behavior of any kind in a stu
dent election. They are relatively simple 
operations and making them more elab
orate than they have to be only creates 
opportunities for mistakes. It speaks to 
the mentality of much of this school 
that even the easiest of operations must 
be operated at an overly draconian, pro
fessional caliber. The primary problem 
is that projects are not undertaken by 
professionals. They are undertaken 
by students who hold themselves to a 
much higher standard than they may 
be capable of achieving.
The Elections Chair and Board should 
be concerned with simplicity and good 
practice above all else. These are not 
hard-hitting campaigners with whom 
they are dealing; they are students, stu
dents who genuinely have an interest 
in improving their school and making 
it a better place. The Chair could set 
an example for many student projects 
if they sacrificed formality for fairness, 
and if he closely moderated candidates 
operations to promote as much good 
sportsmanship as possible.
Responsibility is not a bad thing. 
Rather than just ensuring the 
technicalities are in place, the Elections 
Chair could take a stance on candidate 
ethics. Such a role would make the 
election more enjoyable for everyone in 
the student body. After all, if we cannot 
promote fairness and accessibility in an 
academic atmosphere, it reflects poorly 
on our attitude as a school.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 11, 2005A7

I would like to extend my 
heartfelt congratulations to 
Thomas Sabram and Nicolette 
Louissaint on their recent elec
tion. Student government will 
be in the hands of very capable 
students next year. But will hav
ing capable student government 
leaders result in a capable stu
dent government?
Im not optimistic. Students 
involved with student gov
ernment are afraid of taking 
any controversial stand. The 
situation has degraded to the 
point that most Student Senators 
are afraid of the idea of student 
government tackling issues that 
arent either handed to it by the 
administration or perceived as 
being overwhelmingly popular. 
We will continue to see student 
government stay involved with 
policies regarding putting up 
posters on campus, the use of 
plus-minus grading, and exams; 
but we wont have a student 
government involved with issues 
such as financial aid, race rela
tions, or student rights. While 
The Tartan has no problems 
addressing any of these issues, 
student government remains 
conspicuously silent.
The degeneration of student 
government into a social club 
for students who seek to prac
tice Roberts Rules of Order 
reached its peak this year, when 
at the Student Body Presidential
Debate all three tickets hid their 
real views on issues behind 
pleasantries and carefully 
worded statements. Candidates 
repeatedly deflected ques
tions on the issue of diversity 
by instead choosing to address 
the problem of diversity of 
thought, a nice-sounding way 
to request affirmative action 
policies extend to promote con
servative thought.
Can anyone who attended 
that debate honestly tell me 
one controversial, or even dar
ing, promise that was made? 
Politicians are known for raising 
the hopes of people and then 
disappointing them after they 
take office; here at Carnegie 
Mellon, it seems our politicians 
can get away with being a disap
pointment even before they are 
elected.
Many in student government 
believe, mistakenly, that student 
government would improve if 
only there were some way to 
better communication between 
students and Senators. It is hard 
to accept that Student Senators 
are ignorant of issues of impor
tance on this campus.
Only rarely, such as the case 
this year with Port Authority 
buses, will student govern
ment actually take and promote 
a strong stance on an issue of 
importance to students. For far 
too many issues, representing 
the interests of students is a 
responsibility left to groups of
students that want something to 
be done.
In 2002, I worked with the 
Progressive Student Alliance on 
an Open The Books campaign, 
aimed at having the University 
open access to University bud
gets wherever possible. We built 
a coalition with a wide range 
of groups, including the College 
Republicans, and were able to 
collect hundreds of signatures 
from students, including mem
bers of Student Senate. While 
we met with Vice President of 
Enrollment Bill Elliott, Student
Jimi Okelana/Art Staff
Body President Brian Namey 
not only failed to address the 
issue, but also vetoed student 
governments own Freedom of 
Information Act.
In 2003 and 2004, People for 
Workers Rights highlighted the 
unfair treatment of contracted 
workers, specifically janitors, on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus and 
collected over 1000 signatures 
from students. The issue was 
raised at a Senate meeting, and 
then-Student Body President 
Dan Gilman expressed concern 
and interest in the campaign.
People for Workers Rights 
continued to work on the issue, 
while student government has 
never, to this day, done anything 
at all to support fair treatment of 
workers on our campus.
In either of these campaigns, 
student government involve
ment might have enabled 
students to win more conces
sions, or at least ensured that 
the issue remained on the collec
tive agenda of students. One key 
difference between student gov
ernment and state and federal 
government is that at Carnegie 
Mellon, decision makers are 
accessible to students. Students 
can, and often do, directly 
petition the administration for 
change. There is often no need 
to go through student govern
ment, because directly contact
ing the administration often 
proves more effective.
Officials in student gov
ernment need to get over the 
idea that students should 
bring their problems to stu
dent government. If a student 
cares enough to improve his or 
her situation, that student will 
often contact the administra
tion directly. The question is not 
what we can do for student gov
ernment; it is what student gov
ernment can do for us. Student 
government needs to find a way 
to start proactively and pre
emptively bringing issues to the 
administration, or else accept 
their position of irrelevance.

If your radius of travel extends from 
Margaret Morrison to Hamburg Hall, here 
is a helping hand. Wake up one morn
ing, brush those pearly whites and stare 
deeply, longingly, into the mirror. Is the 
person staring back at you a well cultured 
individualor a slave to those technically 
driven whips, decisively thrashed by the 
hands of Carnegie Mellons pharaohs?
If your significant excursion for the 
weekend is to the film in the University 
Center, hop on the bus with your favor
ite Underground sweetheart. The buss 
first stop: Outside of the Carnegie Mellon 
bubble. Dieseling down Fifth Avenue and 
over the bridge, a new frontier opens. 
Similar to your sweethearts supple lips 
awaiting a passionate kiss, the South Side 
opens up to you.
The vast expanse represents one of the 
regions most underutilized resources, 
open and accessible to Carnegie Mellon 
students. The bus stops, kneels, and with 
a quick flash of your CMU ID you are 
released into the wild. What is this magi
cal place? Compared to campus, you are 
now being exposed to some true diver
sity. Quickly, you usher your sugar across 
Carson Street for a quick cup of coffee 
and toke on the hookah at the HKAN. 
Smokingly satiated, your night is ready 
to begin.
While throwing back a beer and taking 
a shot at neighboring Margaritaville and 
enjoying the sounds of a local band, you 
begin thinking about how you havent 
heard good jazz and blues since you left 
home for CMU. Fear not; within five 
blocks there awaits Paparazzi, a decent 
Italian restaurant and better bar with 
live jazz and blues three nights a week. 
Walking into this rat-pack throwback es
tablishment fills your mind with thoughts 
of jazzy notes and strong gin and tonics. 
TJ the bartender takes your drink order
and whips up from fresh mozzarella and 
tomato with a house-blend dipping olive 
oil. The band on the quaint stage consists 
of two horns, an upright bass and a fe
male vocalist. Tossing back another mixed 
drink and a shot, out the door you go.
Even though they forgot to card you at 
that last establishment, you are armed 
with that piece of plastic that says 21, 
and thus the heavy lifting can begin. 
Taking your New House hotties hand, you 
march down Carson Street, the numbers 
descending, and head for some more live 
music and well-priced drinks. Gingerly 
crossing the street, dodging motorcycles 
and other meandering pedestrians, you 
arrive at Club Caf. Patron, head in side 
for some libations and reverberations. Pay 
a couple bucks for a cover, and take down 
that first drink. Ah that sweet nectar, 
you think, and you begin to get introspec
tive.
You have been at Carnegie Mellon for 
almost a year now, but this is the first 
time you ventured out of that seemingly 
safe zone. Multicultural fairs and ethnic 
food expositions introduce students to 
cultures never before experienced, but 
these events simply cannot teach what 
one can learn in the living field. Instead 
of being lectured by, have a conversation 
with, your professors. One will realize 
that those forty and fifty-somethings have 
a whole lifes experience tucked under 
their belts.
Know this, young explorer: There is 
nothing more unsafe than restriction 
and social censorship. The educational 
opportunities at Carnegie Mellon are 
worth the price of admission, but the 
overall structure of general student life 
lacks depth. The best corrective action is 
direct action. Thus the next time you are 
pondering what to do this Saturday night, 
take a risk. When you return, you can hop 
back on AIM and e-tell your friends all 
about it.
Dont fight the future

The Recording Industry Association 
of America is getting exceedingly good 
at what it does best: making enemies. 
Last week, the RIAA issued at least 
30 subpoenas to Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity, asking for the names of stu
dents who hold registration rights to 
IP addresses that the RIAA found to be 
sharing music and violating copyrights. 
These subpoenas are just the latest epi
sode in the ongoing dispute of the in
dustry versus the world.
The RIAA and its Hollywood coun
terpart, the Motion Picture Association 
of America, have been bullying internet 
denizens for nearly two years, issuing 
hundreds of lawsuits. These lawsuits 
have gained notoriety for being brutal 
and misdirected. The case of Brianna 
LeHara, the 12-year-old girl living in 
a housing project, who was sued for 
thousands of dollars  a sum that the 
family could not possibly pay  is a 
prime example of just how the RIAA is 
turning public opinion against them.
Enter what Wynn Quon, an analyst 
from Legado Associates, calls the Jack
boot Paradox. When a figure of power 
cracks down on the people working 
against it, more and more people will 
join the rebellion. The recording indus
try is creating more bad press with each 
lawsuit it files, and that bad press goes 
straight to the market that business 
executives value most  the 18-to-25- 
year-old demographic. From the mo
ment the RIAA sued Napster out of ex
istence in 2001, the industry has been 
trying to quash innovation as quickly as 
new peer-to-peer file sharing programs 
pop up. A glimmer of hope came in 
2003, as several companies launched 
online music stores, allowing users
to legally download individual songs, 
paying for them directly by credit card. 
These music stores have met with lim
ited success with the exception of Ap
ples i1\mes Music Store, which has sold 
over 300 million songs in two years.
The RIAA is going about their fight 
the wrong way. Despite their claims 
that music piracy is hurting sales, there 
is not nearly enough evidence to back 
those claims up. In fact, there are many 
pieces of evidence that would seem to 
indicate exactly the opposite. For ex
ample, Radioheads album Kid A de
buted at number one, and stayed there 
for several weeks. The interesting part 
is that Kid A was leaked in its entirety 
months before the albums release date, 
lending credit to the growing belief 
that music sharing could significantly 
increase album sales.
People dont see a reason to buy CDs 
anymore, and the way to make them 
want to pay for music is not to threaten 
to destroy their lives through lawsuits 
and exorbitant settlements. Apple has 
shown that people will pay for music if 
the price is rightand the peer-to-peer 
world is still teeming despite every at
tempt to curtail it. If the RIAA wants to 
salvage any good will left in consumers, 
it needs to stop treating everyone like 
a criminal. The industry continues to 
push for draconian restrictions on pur
chased music, either through CDs that 
cannot be played in a computer or on 
ridiculous limitations from online mu
sic stores. People want music  they 
just dont want to get screwed in the 
process. The RIAA needs to listen to 
its consumers and they need to do it 
quickly, before the iron fist gets rusty.

Its that time of year again. 
The sun is shining, the birds are 
singing, and Im here making 
my specialized, Compubookie 
predictions of this years winners 
and losers. Lets get to it:
Coming into day 2 for the 
women, we have SPIRIT A. 
Maybe if they focused more on 
the pushers and less on the paint 
job...
Sig Nu A will once again 
perform, just not well enough to 
make a difference. Unless they 
have been juicing these girls, 
they dont have the strength to 
finish on top.
The girls of SDC A are going 
to do a mediocre job once again. 
They need to do some serious re
thinking if they want to win.
Fringe, while great at 
recruiting fast men, does not have 
a comparable womens team. 
The buggies are still top notch, 
but they will need stronger and 
faster women to beat PiKA.
The female powerhouses of 
Beta A have, after Beta pulled 
out, joined forces with the 
buggies of Sig Ep. This 
combination will be fast enough 
to pull a second place finish, but 
not enough for first.
After beating their own 
womens course record last year, 
the girls of PiKA A will claim 
their prize once again. Look for 
them to win it, but they wont be 
breaking any records for a while.
Now for the mens competition, 
the field this year is as volatile as 
last year. Hopefully there will 
be fewer disqualifications this 
year, as race day looked more 
like a blooper reel than a normal 
sweepstakes.
KDR will squeeze into the 
second day this year, but Im not 
sure they understand that they 
should put their fastest pushers 
on the A team.
CIA A will once again prove 
that they should stop wasting 
their time and get some sleep on 
the weekends.
Fringe is one of those rare 
organizations good enough to 
get their B team to the second 
day. Fringe B should put up a 
respectable time and give Fringe 
some DQ insurance.
After their A-team spin last
year, SDC should get their act 
together and go back to their 
normal, lackluster performance.
PiKA B is always a wild card; 
Im never sure where to put them. 
Their pushers were stripped and 
replaced by PiKAs A team last 
year after the A team spin, but 
they still showed a strong enough 
showing on day one to leave PiKA 
in a good position.
Always looking to the past for 
their glory days, SPIRIT A will 
have to keep looking. Although 
some promising pushers will 
keep them in the top five.
The Zoo will use their great 
buggies to place fourth this year, 
but they can do no better without 
some kind of push team. I feel 
sorry for the pasty slobs I see 
pushing those beasts up the hills 
every year. I feel like a broken 
record on this subject, but 
Sig Nu needs to rush some decent 
athletes if they ever hope to break 
into the lead.
With their suprise finish last 
year, look for Sig Ep A to repeat 
their great performance. With a 
little bit more experience, these 
guys could take the trophy one 
day.
And now we come to PiKA 
A. Some will claim that I have 
wronged them in the past, but 
I stand by my predictions. They 
may have last years trophy, but 
we all know that Fringe was the 
real victor. With their A team 
buggy unable to even finish the 
course, their B team (with A team 
pushers, I might add) returned 
only a mediocre time. Without 
their incredible luck, PiKA would 
place second every time.
This years champion will be... 
Fringe A. They should have won 
last year and they have made 
great strides in ensuring that they 
will win again. With beautiful 
buggies and the best pushers 
Carnegie Mellon varsity track has 
to offer, the Fringetypes will put 
in a trophy-winning time. The 
humiliation of defeat the last few 
years will give this organization 
the drive it needs to succeed.
Thats the race this year. I will 
be watching as always, and try 
as you might, you wont see me 
out there.

CLUB SPORTS
Baseball Mens Lacrosse
The baseball club lost the first 
games of the season on Saturday 
to CCAC Allegheny, 5-1 and 12-1 
(in five innings). Tartan pitchers 
issued six walks and hit seven 
batters, and the defense allowed 
six unearned runs. The team 
looks to rebound this Saturday 
against nemesis Robert Morris 
University.
Water Polo
The water polo team played 
in the Ohio University Spring 
Invitational last weekend, defeat
ing Ohio Wesleyan 12-5 and 
Ohio Universitys B team 15-7. 
On Sunday they took on Ohio 
State, and fell to the much larg

Faced with the third-place game, 
the Tartans faced Central Ohio 
University and battled up and 
down the pool, but were unable 
to pull out the victory. The final 
score was 8-5 in the favor of 
Central Ohio. The water polo 
team finished fourth of eight

It was the final scheduled game 
for the team.

II April 2005THE TARTANTHE
Baseball finally opens season
\--------------------------------------
by Kevin LaBuz
Staffwrit'er
With the 'string of bad weather 
in the past few weeks, the 
baseball club saw their first three 
games of the season postponed 
or canceled. When they took 
the field Saturday to take on the 
Community College of Allegheny 
County, their rust was evident. 
Sloppy play marked a tough 
double-header for the Tartans at 
the CCACs Allegheny campus, 
but the team will take the games 
as a learning experience and look 
to move past the defeats and put 
together a strong season. The 
Tartans ultimately dropped both 
games to the Cougars, losing the 
first game by a score of 5-1 and 
the second 12-1 in five innings. 
Yet despite the lopsided final 
scores, head coach Kevin Cohn 
thinks that what hurt the team 
was simply a series of correctable 
mistakes. We need to be more 
aggressive at the plate, he said. 
We struck out looking a lot today. 
Cohn said the Tartans pitchers 
need to work on improving their 
control, as the Cougars offense 
greatly benefited from walks and 
hit batters.
Despite the loss in the first 
game, the team played fairly well, 
especially defensively However, 
the Cougars starting pitcher, 
whose overpowering fastball 
was clocked at over 80 mph, 
ultimately overwhelmed the 
Tartans. His power and command 
of the ball effectively neutralized 
the Tartans offense.
Graduate student pitcher and 
center fielder Dan Ruef batted 
in both of the Tartans runs, and 
he will be heavily relied upon

throughout the season to spark 
the Tartans offense. Sophomore 
pitcher and third baseman Doug 
Peters started the first game for 
the Tartans, and junior pitcher 
and infielder Jack Bader started 
the second. Both pitchers 
struggled with their ball control 
and hurt themselves by giving 
the Cougars free base runners by 
issuing walks and hitting batters.
The team is dramatically 
improved over last years team, 
said Cohn. Today we were 
getting used to playing together 
as a team; for a lot of guys this was 
their first time playing together.

Baseball Ryan Comes , a sopho
more catcher, was on the receiv
ing end of over 90 pitches in four 
innings in Carnegie Mellons 
12-1 loss to CCAC Allegheny on 
Saturday. His plate defense and 
game calling kept the Tartans 
within striking range for most of 
the game, despite suspect defense 
which led to six unearned runs.
He also contribured on both the 
offensive and defensive ends in a 
5-1 loss that started the doubleheader.
Mens Tennis Rex CarazoZapetis, a sophomore, record
ed the Tartans only point in 
singles competition against 
Swarthmore. He won a hard 
fought tiebreaker match over 
Swarthmores Justin Durand 
10-6 to lock up a victory last 
Saturday.
While the team has no seniors 
and only one graduate student, 
its roster is stacked with several 
experienced juniors and the 
team has a solid group of firstyears who will add depth to 
the team. Shortstop A.J. Little 
is one of the first-years looking 
to make an impact on the team 
this year. His play earned him 
the attention of Cohn, who 
was pleased with Littles plate 
presence and defensive play. 
Cohn also remarked that he 
expects first-year catcher Ryan 
Comes to continue to develop 
behind the plate. Comes had an

play, 6-4, 6-0.

outstanding game calling pitches 
against CCAC Allegheny.
This year the team will be 
led by Ruef, who will serve as 
the pitching staffs ace as well 
as providing some much-needed 
offensive support. Team captain 
and second baseman Matt 
Corbett, a junior, should also 
provide the team with significant 
contributions.
While the teams play was shaky, 
that is to be expected from the 
first game of the season. They will 
play two games next Saturday at 
Robert Morris University. The first 
pitch will be thrown at noon.
Womens Track Karoline Evans, 
a senior weight thrower, scored 
points in two events for the 
Tartans at the Washington & 
Jefferson Invitational Saturday. 
She won the discus with a throw 
of 34.82 meters and came back to 
place fifth in the shot put with a 
toss of 10.98 meters.
Water Polo Daniel Sunday, a
junior hole-set, led the team in 
scoring and helped the Tartans 
get to a fourth place finish at 
the Ohio University Spring 
Invitational. This included an 
eight goal performance that led 
the team to victory on Saturday 
against Ohio.
Tennis teams in tune-ups for UAA Championships
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
Fifteenth-ranked Swarthmore 
proved to be too much for the 
mens tennis team this weekend 
as the Tartans dropped a 2-5 
decision Saturday Despite strong 
performances in doubles play and 
a slew of matches that went to 
three sets, the men were worn 
down by a strong Swarthmore 
team. The loss drops Carnegie 
Mellon to 9-5 overall.
The Tartans came out strong, 
running through doubles play to 
earn the first point of the match. 
The combination of senior Boris 
Sofman and sophomore Jordan 
Koslosky powered through to an 
8-5 victory at first doubles that set 
the stage for the men. First-years 
Andrew Clearfield and Stephen 
Kuhn finished off the scoring with 
an 82 win over Justin Durand 
and Sam Sidhu oThe team was 
able to carry some of this momen
tum into singles competition, as 
Clearfield and junior Carl Yang 
sped off to quick first set victo
ries, 3-6 and 1-6, respectively. 
However, their Swarthmore oppo
nents came charging back to force
third sets in both cases. Despite 
big efforts in the final sets, both 
men fell to their opponents, giv
ing Swarthmore a 2-1 edge.
The Tartans were given a boost 
by the inspired play of sopho
more Rex Carazo-Zapetis, who 
battled through two sets and into 
a tiebreaker with opponent Justin 
Durand. The fresher CarazoZapetis, who was not in doubles 
action, overpowered Durand 
to earn a 10-6 victory and give 
Carnegie Mellon their second 
point of the day.
However, this would prove to be 
the end of the scoring for the men, 
as Sofman, Kuhn, and Koslosky 
all lost tough singles matches to 
clinch it for Swarthmore. Though 
the loss is tough to take, will take 
a lot away from the fight. Despite 
the outcome, each match was a 
battle, and the Tartans will take a 
lot out of this experience.
On the opposite side, the 
womens team rolled to a
7-2 victory over California 
University of Pennsylvania 
last Monday. They took the 
momentum built after a strong 
match against the University of 
Pittsburgh and translated it into 
an easy win over CUP. Mona Iyer
Mona Iyer and Amy Staloch continued to dominate on Monday.

and Amy Staloch continued their 
stellar play, going a combined 
32-6 in singles and doubles 
matches.
As Staloch and Iyer led the 
way, the rest of the team car
ried the Tartans to victory. Mai 
Otsuka, Grace Hwang, and Alison 
Liu all rolled to straight set victo
ries against their CUP opponents, 
sealing the match for the Tartans. 
Also winning was the doubles 
team of Otsuka and Kavita Shah.
The 15th-ranked Tartan team 
seemed to have no trouble rolling
over their opponents, winning 
each of their matches in straight 
sets. They will look to carry this 
outstanding play into the UAA 
Championships, which will be 
held April 15-17 at Brandeis 
University in Boston.
Both the mens and womens 
teams will have to deal with 
tough competition at the UAAs, 
mainly from Division III power
house Emory University. Emory 
is currently ranked third among 
mens teams and first in the 
womens division.
Kelly named new 
volleyball coach
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
Kim Kelly, one of the most 
prolific setters in Gettysburg 
volleyball history, is coming to 
Carnegie Mellon. Kelly will take 
over as head womens volleyball 
coach following the departure 
of former coach Julie Bigger. 
Bigger held the position for nine 
years and guided the women to 
three straight Eastern College 
Athletic Conference titles from 
2002 to 2004.
Kelly began 
her coach
ing career 
immediately 
after gradu
ating from 
Gettysburg, 
taking an
assistant beg anffu
coach position at the school 
from 1992 until 1996. In 96, 
she was given the opportunity 
to become head coach on an 
interim basis. After a successful 
season, she was given control 
of the team and served as their 
leader from 1997 to 2004.
The teams play has been
impressive in the nine years 
since Kelly took over. Under her 
leadership last year, the Bullets 
went 28-6 and made it to the 
NCAA Division III National 
Tournament, where they 
advanced to the regional semi
finals before bowing out with 
a loss to third-seeded Eastern 
University. The team qualified 
for the NCAA Tournament eight 
times during Kellys tenure and 
compiled a 250-82 overall 
record during that time.
Kelly will have big shoes to fill 
with the loss of Bigger. Bigger, 
a tough coach who demanded 
the most from her athletes, 
was largely responsible for the 
recent resurgence of Carnegie 
Mellon volleyball. She had the 
burden of playing in the more 
competitive UAA, where Kelly 
will find tougher competition 
more rigors of traveling, and 
helping students manage their 
time. This was an aspect of the 
sport that Bigger handled well.
As a player at Gettysburg, 
Kelly was one of the most valu
able members of her team. She 
is currently third on the alltime assists list at Gettysburg 
with 2079 assists.
Track teams place first, 
second, at W&J Invite
by Akil Simon
Staffwriter
Despite hosting a meet 
Wednesday this week, the mens 
and womens track teams didnt 
hold anything back Saturday. 
The Tartans performed at an 
exceptional level this past week
end, where the Men took first 
and the women placed second 
at the Washington and Jefferson 
College Invitational. This show
ing proved to be the best of the 
young 2005 season so far.
In their ascent to second 
place, the womens track 
team amassed a score of 
131 total points. In the 
field events for the meet, 
senior Karoline Evans took 
first place with a throw of 
34.82 meters in the discus. 
Additionally, Evans placed fifth 
in the shot put with a throw 
of 10.89 meters. Closing out 
the field events was sophomore 
Becky Metier, who threw
11.94 meters to place second in 
the shot put.
The relay teams for the 
women had a strong showing, 
with both the 4x400 and the 
4xl00-meter teams adding to 
the overall scoring. The 4x400 
relay team crossed the line 
with a time of 4:14.02 for first. 
The 4x100 relay team came in 
at 51.86, bringing them a sec
ond-place finish. Sophomore 
Amber Fuller took third place 
in the 400-meter dash with a 
time of 63.70.
The womens track team saw 
considerable success in the 
mid to long distance events. 
First-year Ashley Bakelum fin
ished second in the 800-meter 
with a time of 2:26.72. In the 
1500-meter, junior Jocelyn 
Sikora finished in 4:43.11, 
which was good enough for sec
ond place. The depth and skill 
of the womens distance corps 
was best demonstrated in the 
3000-meter steeplechase event. 
Juniors K.J. Helmstetter, Carrie 
Mallozzi, and Kelly Cronin fin
ished in second, third and fourth 
place respectively and earned
21 points for the team. In the 
end, the second-place finish
was the Tartans best perfor
mance of the outdoor season 
to date.
On the other side, the men 
ended the meet with seven 
first-place finishes and 10 top 
three finishes to lead them to 
victory. Two of the first place 
finishes came from the pow
erful Tartan relay teams. The 
4x100 relay came in with a 
time of 43.76 and the 4x400 B 
relay team finished in 3:29.17, 
beating the heavily favored A 
team in a bout of intra-team 
competition.
The distance runners contin
ued the success that has been 
building over the course of 
the season. Junior Dana Irrer, 
placed first in the 1500 run with 
a time of 4:00.24. In the 5000 
meters, Nick End finished in first 
place with a time of 15:59.77.
In the sprint events, the 
Tartans had three performances 
that scored points contributing 
to their win, despite the fact 
that UAA indoor 200-meter 
champion Russel Verbofsky ran 
the 400 rather than his normal 
event. Senior Nik Bonaddio 
took first in the 400-meter event 
with a time of 48.67. Verbofsky 
crossed the line shortly after 
to take second with a time of 
50.77. Sophomore Eric Tang 
placed third in the 100-meter 
dash with a time of 11.52. Tang 
also contributed in the field 
with a long jump distance of 
6.40 meters. His performance 
secured a second place finish, 
giving him 15 points to 
contribute to the team.
The hurdle events proved to 
be the teams strength. Sweeping 
the 110-meter hurdles were 
Sophomores Nick Bannister 
(16.14) and Tom Kuczynski 
(16.50) who placed first and sec
ond with senior teammate Matt 
Dalka (16.93) coming in third 
place. Dalka recorded an addi
tional third place finish in the 
400 hurdles with a time of 57.74. 
Tartans freshman Kiley Williams 
recorded a first place finish in 
this event with a time of 56.50.
The Tartans men and wom
ens track teams look to con
tinue their success Wednesday 
as they host Waynesburg.

In memoriam
The son of the head of the design department passes away
Colin James Boyarski, son of design department 
head Daniel Boyarski, recently passed away at 
the age of 19. Colin, a freshman at Kenyon 
University in Ohio, was found dead on Sunday, 
April 3. The circumstances leading to his death 
are still under investigation, but it appears that 
the ultimate cause of death was hypothermia.
My first memory of Colin is him racing down 
the street in front of me and laughing that I 
wasnt able to catch him. Our fathers are both 
professors in the design department here at 
Carnegie Mellon, and we met when we were 
both very young children. Colin and I only saw 
one another a dozen or so times as kids. This last 
summer, however, I spent several weeks working 
with him as work studies here at CMU. Colin 
and I talked while we worked, and he told me 
about high school, his friends, and our families. 
We would joke about the design kid bond that 
we shared. I was so impressed with the young 
man that Colin had become: He was intelligent, 
funny, kind, and well-spoken. His excitement to 
study at Kenyon was obvious. He held little of 
the fear that freshmen often have about going 
to college.
Colin attended Carlow Campus School, a small 
and nurturing private school, up through eighth 
grade. During his high school years, he attended 
and graduated with honors from Taylor 
Allderdice High School here in Pittsburgh. He 
was involved in the ski club, the environmental 
club, Model UN, and a student group for 
alleviating hunger, as well as the National Honor 
Society. Colin also participated in Dynamo Soccer 
for about 13 years. The broad range of activities 
in which Colin was active led him to have a large 
group of friends. Although he was still a private 
and, at times, shy person, he was also genuine: 
Colin was able to put you at ease with a single 
smile. His friends have described him as the glue 
that held their group together, and his every 
spare minute was spent either with friends or 
making plans to see them.
Colin was well traveled for such a young person: 
He had made trips to Italy, New Zealand, 
Australia, and, just this past January, to the 
Philippines. For his 16th birthday, he traveled to 
New Zealand and Australia for two weeks with 
his dad. Colin loved the many different and new 
cultural foods that he was able to try during his 
travels, and his interest in different cultures was 
further developed at Kenyon, where he had not
yet chosen a major but was showing great interest 
and promise and philosophy and art history.
As well as the many activities Colin participated 
in during high school, the summer after he 
graduated he chose to work as a tutor at 
Homewood Montessori. Colin worked there 
with grade-school children to help prepare them 
for the coming school year. Colin took his job 
seriously, and it was obvious that he enjoyed it: 
He often brought home reports of his kids to his 
parents. His father told me a story that Colin had 
relayed to him about a breakthrough day for two 
of his students: Colin had come home beaming 
that the kids whom he was teaching long division 
finally understood the concept. Colin was so 
proud of his students that he promised ice cream 
cones as a reward. When he got to McDonalds, 
he realized he only had enough money to buy 
either his own lunch or the ice cream; without 
further consideration, he ordered the cones. 
Colin had been planning to reapply to be a tutor 
for this coming summer.
Colin will not be soon forgotten. Personally, I 
have dozens of mental snapshots and videos, 
memories of his dimpled smile, his laugh, or him 
teasing me. Colin touched more lives than I am. 
sure he ever knew.
Colin is survived by his parents, Dan and Libby 
Boyarski, as well as his older sister Lusia. A 
candlelight vigil will be held for Colin on Monday, 
April 11, at 8:30 pm on the CFAlawn. A memorial 
service will be held on Sunday, April 17, at 2 pm 
in the Great Hall in CFA. More information is 
available at www.boyarskifamily.net.

Student Council passed a motion prohibiting any professional musical aggregation 
from appearing on campus during Spring Carnival other than the regularly scheduled 
Carnival acts. This action was taken to prohibit fraternities from hiring musical acts, 
as Student Council felt that these acts would compete with the regular Carnival dances 
and performances, as had been the case for quite some time.

Muddy Waters was announced as the Spring Carnival concert act, sponsored by 
both AB Carnival Committee and SDC. Widely known as one of the most influential 
blues musicians of the 50s and 60s, Waters had recendy toured with Eric Clapton. A 
tribute to Muddy Waters had been held the previous summer at Radio City Music Hall. 
Admission cost $3 for the general public and $2 for students, with a 50-cent discount 
for dorm residents.

Three members of AEPi were hurt when their booth collapsed during construction on 
Midway. The students were working on building an Animaniacs-themed booth that 
included a yellow water tower, similar to the one on the Warner Bros. logo. The tower 
had been constructed lopsided, and it fell over as the students were tying to put on 
the roof. The three students were sent to Presbyterian Hospital, but all were released 
with minor injuries. The booth fell into Betas booth area, but their booth hadnt been 
installed yet so no damage was done. AEPi immediately began work on repairing the 
booth, which stood up through Carnival.

Faculty Senate accepted a new health benefits policy that granted coverage to same-sex 
domestic partners. The Human Relations Commission had studied the issue and had 
submitted the policy for Faculty Senate to review. The Commission conducted several 
hearings in 1999 and 2000 for the community to voice their opinions on the policy. 
Several attendees at these hearings had arrived with Bibles, voicing their opinion that 
homosexuality is contrary to their religion and thus should not be supported by the 
University. Nonetheless, Faculty Senate accepted the Commissions suggestion and 
extended the current benefits to include same-sex domestic partners.

The fat lady has sung
Why opera singers and professional boxers should get new day jobs
It seems fair to consider todays American society to be 
part of the Modern Age. Sure, we dont have flying cars 
yet, but I think the political, sociological, and technologi
cal infrastructures here are more than sufficient for us to 
consider ourselves modern.
That having been said, Ive noticed that we have a lot of 
completely useless forms of entertainment that were at 
one time popular but are at the moment surviving only to 
preserve tradition. Now dont get me wrong  some tra
ditional things are fine and well, but its silly to hang on to 
an art or entertainment form just because people liked it 
hundreds of years ago. Instead, I think that as upstanding 
citizens of this modern era, we should let go of the past 
and support the elimination of superfluous media. Here 
are two of them.
The first on my list is a fairly easy target: the opera. It is 
crystal clear that it is time to close the book on the opera 
game. Back in the 1800s, or whenever it first started (I 
dont have a research budget), Im sure opera was topnotch. I bet they even had scalpers at all the top European 
houses. Back then, all of the classic composers were at the 
top of their game. (They must have had a heyday at some 
point, right?) But lets face facts; its 2005. We have Play
station 2, where the controllers vibrate when your charac
ter gets hit. Weve all seen Star Wars and The Matrix. There 
have been 50 years of recorded rock music. With such 
modern electronic wonders available, it just isnt possible 
that high-pitched (very high-pitched) singing in a foreign 
language is reeling in a whole lot of youngsters these day. 
Thus, I propose that opera community should just call 
it quits. No more performances, no more compositions, 
and most importantly, no pretentious monocle-wearing 
people having to pretend that they find it enjoyable. Hold 
a press conference and say, Look, it was a good run, but
weve realized that opera is outdated and its time for us 
to move on. Thanks for your support over the years. Its 
been fun.
Maybe opera could even hang on for a while longer in 
Italy or something like that, just to satisfy the tradition
alists. Or maybe just have a museum that nobody visits. 
Either way, its time to stop acting like having a relatively 
unpopular thing like opera around gives us culture, 
everyones favorite code word for boring.
The early popularity of boxing is not hard to understand
 it was easier for old-time sportsmen to grasp the con
cept of beating their opponents senseless than to worry 
about full counts and first downs. Plus, it was one of the 
first popular televised sports (along with pro wrestling) 
simply because it was easy to film. But now that we have 
our well-designed modern games and broadcasting tech
niques, theres really no need for prizefighting to continue 
just because it used to be popular. The sports visibility has 
been waning pretty much since Rocky N  I doubt anyone 
reading this can even name the heavyweight champion of 
the world at the moment (no, it isnt Mike Tyson) despite 
the fact that there are roughly eight of them.
Its clear that 21st-century sports fans prefer the more re
fined violence of the gridiron, where although it is often 
advantageous to concuss your opponent, its not actually 
required to achieve victory. The solution to boxings fad
ing hold on sports fans is clear  simply get rid of it. Trust 
me, no one other than pay-per-view executives and casino 
owners are going to notice. Get with the opera people and 
coordinate press conferences if you like. The sweet sci
ence, as boxing is often bizarrely called (its neither sweet 
nor scientific), should just ride off into the sunset, and its 
participants brain cells will forever thank them.
The powers that be in the realms of opera and boxing, Im 
asking you sincerely: Give it a rest. We have plenty of great 
entertainment options, thanks, and things will be much 
easier on us all if you stop trying to be relevant. For sure, 
there are tons of other classic forms of entertainment 
that have had their moment in the sun and should think 
about retirement. I could have written this entire column 
about circuses, since pretty much any elephant-based di
version is going to be a bit antiquated. Plus, Ive restricted 
myself to things popular in the relatively untraditional 
U.S.  Lord only knows what sorts of outdated arts and 
entertainment are foisting themselves on the rest of the 
world. I think that most unpopular forms of entertain
ment will eventually go away out of public apathy, but I 
say thats not soon enough.

Ralphie May
Interview with Carnival comedian
Comedian Ralphie May will be performing at Carnival 
on Thursday. May has made many TV appearances, 
including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Last 
Comic Standing. The Tartan got a chance to interview 
him and learn more about what makes hm tick.
Tartan: When was the last time you were in Pittsburgh? 
Ralphie May: I played at the Improv and I stayed 
downtown at the Hilton and I love that whole area. I 
was there in the summer when it was gorgeous and 
there was a huge festival there in the park. Theres 
baseball there  wow, what a ballpark. I grew up a 
Pittsburgh Steelers fan. I heard an interview with Terry 
Bradshaw when I was a kid and I was like, He is the 
only one who sounds like me. You know that country 
cornpone type of guy that he was. I loved it. Pittsburgh 
is a great town; its a great comedy town too.
T: So did you know you wanted to be a comedian back 
then at a young age?
RM: Yeah, I wanted to do stand-up when I was nine. The 
first time I did it I was 13.1 was doing it professionally 
at 17.1 got the opportunity to open up for Sam Kinison 
and he told me to move to Houston and the rest, as they 
say, is history.
T: So is it fun to be on all of these reality shows?
RM: Yeah, Im a really public person. I think to be on 
reality shows you have to be a sort of an exhibitionist. 
Which I am. Im rather indifferent to other peoples 
judgments. So when you free yourself from that, 
everything is awesome. Thats what all these reality 
shows do; they just show people me and my house, and 
me and my life, and me and my dog  and my dog is 
getting commercial credit, thats crazy. Its just kind of 
bizarre.
T: So whats in the future?
RM: Well, I have some movies in the works. I have 
another show called Baggin which is a combat comedy 
show, where two comics stand up and tell jokes and 
crack each other. Like yo mama jokes, like Yo mamas 
getting a coochie on her hip so she can make money on 
the side. And then the other guy would come back and 
say Yeah, well yo mama she dont like barbeques but 
she sure like when my meat hits her grill. They combat 
and the audience votes on it right there and they win 
cash and prizes and its a really funny show.
T: What comedians are the biggest influences on you? 
RM: Sam Kinison, Bill Hicks, Richard Pryor, Eddie 
Murphy, Chris Rock, Doug Stanhope, a lot of great guys.

Psychedelic music albums worth dusting off
Jefferson Airplanes Surrealistic Pillow
This is a column about music from the psychedelic era, a 
time which ranged from about 1964 and the British Inva
sion to 1969 and Woodstock. The psychedelic era was one 
of the most interesting eras in American music because 
there was a new wave of rock that was revolutionary and 
different, inventive and unusual, and was listened to by 
millions.
Even if you dont know what psychedelic music is, you 
undoubtedly know many of the musical groups that were 
a part of it. The Animals, Cream, The Doors, Janis Joplin, 
Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and even the Beatles in their 
later years were all considered psychedelic artists. There 
are many more whom you have not heard of: Aorta, The 
Seeds, Mandrake Paddlesteamer, and ones with even 
stranger names. Every small town in America had at least 
one garage band during this period, usually composed 
of high school kids who produced an average of just one 
45 single in their whole careers. This column will profile 
one album per installment  a retrospection on its sig
nificance and the group that produced it  perhaps as 
an effort to preserve this increasingly forgotten genre of 
Americana, or perhaps simply to direct you, the reader, to 
some really good music.
We begin with one of the most popular psychedelic 
groups ever to make it, and their most successful album. 
Jefferson Airplane was formed in 1965 in San Francisco, 
the very heart of the psychedelic scene. They produced 
one album, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off, in 1966, which, 
while reviewed favorably, did not sell many copies. Later 
that year, the Airplanes lead female singer, Signe Ander
son, left the group for family reasons. She was replaced 
by Grace Slick, who left her group The Great Society to
be with the Airplane. Slick brought with her two songs 
which would make the core of Jefferson Airplanes sec
ond album.
To say that Surrealistic Pillow is a masterpiece is an under
statement. The emotion perfectly captures the feeling of 
the mid-60s; it can make the most conservative of listen
ers want to become flower children. Two hits sprung from 
this album, Somebody to Love and White Rabbit, the 
two songs that Slick had performed with The Great So
ciety. Somebody to Love is Slicks fast-paced vocal tri
umph, accompanied by a kickin guitar solo to finish it off. 
Its a shame that no live performances of this song (in
cluding the one at Woodstock) could match the energy of 
the studio version.
White Rabbit, in contrast, is a trippy Alice in Wonderland-inspired drug anthem. Why a song with this theme 
and with such slow monotony became popular is kind of 
a mystery. It features Slicks vocals with bass and snare 
drum and, like any good psychedelic song, one must lis
ten intently to its lyrics to get the whole message.
Though these two songs are the only ones to really be
come popular, the whole album is a treat. Two of my fa
vorites are slow, deeply emotional hippie love songs. To
day and Cornin Back To Me are easily the two most 
beautiful songs the Airplane ever wrote, maybe even the 
prettiest of the era. Even if you didnt live a day in the 60s, 
these songs really transport you to that incredible time. 
Next come two Airplane staples, 3/5 of a Mile in 10 Sec
onds and D.C.B.A.-25, followed by the unforgettable 
acoustic solo Embryonic Journey, which lived on to be 
performed when the Airplane was inducted into the Rock
n Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.
There really are no bad songs in Surrealistic Pillow. Ex
cept for maybe My Best Friend, a weak attempt at either 
classic rock and roll, country, or something else entirely, 
each song on this album has been influential. Grace Slicks 
extremism doesnt quite match bandleader Marty Balins 
love-ballad style, but together they cover a wide range of 
prevalent styles, a diversity that few other groups would 
experience. This record put Jefferson Airplane on the 
map.
Less than a year later they were put on the cover of Life 
magazine and were featured on popular television va
riety shows, including Ed Sullivans and the Smothers 
Brothers. The Airplanes next three albums are also good, 
but they dont quite capture the emotion of the time the 
way Surrealistic Pillow does. The last two Airplane albums, 
Bark and Long John Silver, really arent worth your time. 
In the early 70s the group fell farther downhill by becom
ing Jefferson Starship, which had a couple good records 
and then fell to the commercialism that the Airplane was 
born to fight. Surrealistic Pillow truly shows the band at 
their prime, when the fight was still in the music.

This indie thriller revolves around four inventors 
who struggle to come to terms with the ramifi
cations of their starding new creation. No, they 
arent building a Segway with spinners  though 
that would have its own disturbing ramifications
 but it could have a far deeper impact than that 
freaky little people-mover. Primer is a classic indie 
film with an unknown cast, a self-taught writerdirector-star, and rave critical reviews. It was 
criticized for being overly technical  perfect for 
a little pre-Carnival brain busting. Enjoy your last 
night of sobriety for the week by checking out this 
masterful movie.

Why would AB Films show a self-important and 
convoluted Danish film on Carnival Thursday? 
Simple: because they can! In a way The Five Ob
structions is a documentary. Directors J0rgen Leth 
and Lars von Trier take turns in a cinematic spar
ring match  they are challenged to make a short 
film within specific bizarre constraints five different 
times; hence the title. The audience gets to see the 
two directors conversing and also the process that 
goes into making each film. However, its not a nor
mal filmmaking process  usually directors arent 
given strict, often arbitrary guidelines they have to 
stick to. I mean, most directors today have a hard 
time even following simple directions, like Dont 
make it suck.

This movie, whose title is Thai for Daredevil, is so 
badass theyre showing it twice. Its star, Tony Jaa, 
has been heralded as the next Bruce Lee, and for 
good reason. He does all his own stunts without 
any wires to help him, and he fights using the ab
solutely brutal martial art of Muay Thai  a form 
of kickboxing that emphasizes the use of the knees 
and elbows and therefore values quick and painful 
incapacitations. Just to make sure you dont miss 
it, its being shown on Friday and Saturday nights, 
so you can balance the Shins with ultraviolent re
venge, if you want to. And you should.

Set at a dance marathon during the Great De
pression, They Shoot Horses stars a young Jane 
Fonda as one of many desparate contestants, 
trying to win some extra cash to stay alive as the 
economy plummets. This movie has been de
scribed as sordid, bleak, draining, and brilliant
 and its directed by the only guy who could 
manage to make Dustin Hoffman dress as a 
woman. It should be a good change of pace from 
the norm, and who doesnt love dance mara
thons? Maybe you will love them, after you see 
this movie.

Fresh faculty
New professors provide interesting research opportunities and perspectives for students
Being dropped into a new role, like coming to the first day 
at college, can be one of the most traumatizing events of 
ones life. New professors, with their brains and arms 
laden with information, can also relate to students who 
feel the pressure of their first day at school. But unlike 
students, professors are expected to have a clear direction: 
they are the bearers of knowledge for students.
Nick Yeung, an assistant professor of psychology, says 
that he was Not nervous, but it did take time to adjust 
to having the freedom to set my own research agenda on 
his first day as a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. 
As a PhD student and post doctorate you always have 
a supervisor guiding your research, he said. So it was 
an interesting experience, on my first day at CMU, to sit 
down at my desk and think Right, so what shall I do with 
the rest of my life? But once professors settle in, their 
unique perspectives can add a lot to the classroom.
Although they are given the freedom to set their own 
research agenda, first year professors at Carnegie Mellon 
University are still expected to have material prepared 
to teach every Monday morning. Certainly, these novice 
professors are already experts in their fields by the time 
that they arrive on campus and they continue to be 
some of the most active participants in research at CMU. 
Although students sometimes overlook these young 
professors in favor of tenured faculty, theyre often some 
of the most innovative leaders in research and teaching 
today.
Psych strikes toward a CMU research future
Young professors are drawn to the University by research 
opportunities, but research also helps professors teach 
their classes. Even for Oxford and Cambridge-educated 
Yeung, CMU had a strong research draw in his eyes.
[CMU has] some of the most influential and impressive 
people in psychology, he said; One of my interests is 
developing computer models of cognitive processes, and 
Pittsburgh is really strong in that.
Yeung, who teaches a cognitive psychology class in 
addition to actively researching the cognitive process 
of attention, describes his research as very relevant to 
teaching: An aspect of research is explaining what you 
are doing to other people, that skill is rather important. 
As a researcher, you dont want to just develop your ideas; 
you want to be able to convey them to other scientists and 
the general public.
Thiessen agreed with Yeung that the research done at 
CMU is what brought him and many other professors 
here in the first place. Carnegie Mellon, especially the 
cognitive psychology department, is really renowned. 
Carnegie Mellon has a really unique approach to doing 
psychology: very mechanistic, computer modeling based. 
It is really well known as being a different approach. 
Ive long been aware of the research people do here [at 
CMU].
Thiessen agrees with Yeung that his new research as a 
first year professor has improved his teaching ability. 
When you do research, you really become an expert in an 
area and you often find that you talk to people that dont 
know as much about your research as you do. He likened 
his research methods to how he reacts in the classroom: 
You know a lot more about psychology than the people 
who are trying to learn from you, he said, and if you 
use jargon that goes over everyones head, they wont be 
able to learn from you. So you have to be able to unpack 
it and explain it in a way that people who arent experts 
will understand.
Creative collaborations in visual and verbal forms
Outside of the psychology department, professors such 
as Susan Hagan, a postdoctoral fellow in the English 
department, focus on a different form of research topic 
all together. Hagan graduated from the doctoral program 
at Carnegie Mellon last year, and now works as a firstyear professor, specifically a postdoctoral fellow. Her 
work focuses on the interplay between visual and verbal 
communication. More specifically, Hagan explained, 
what Ive developed is a framework for the study of 
visual and verbal meaning collaboration.
Hagan noted that many professors attempt to integrate 
their particular area of expertise into the classroom. 
Oftentimes, when you can, you try to weave some of 
[your work] in.
Hagan noted that her wealth of knowledge on topics of 
visual and verbal collaboration can provide a challenge 
to teach in her class. I have a perspective on whats 
missing from the literature and what needs to be added. 
While I want to get that across, I want to leave room for 
my students to push and pull in this area, said Hagan. 
She tries to balance the material she teaches by providing 
students with a solid background of material in the field 
that is tried and true, while giving them enough extra 
information to allow for exploration.
In addition, Hagan noted the positive dynamic that 
comes from interacting with other professors at Carnegie 
Mellon. Given what I know about the faculty here I 
cant imagine a more opening, giving, and intellectually 
inspiring place. There are fully tenured faculty [here] 
and I feel Im totally comfortable with them. Were in 
this wonderful environment and we can learn from each 
other.
Three screen shots from "What Gives Power  a project done 
for Susan Hagans Language in Design course, a client project 
course in which graduate and undergraduate designer/writer 
teams study languages needed to produce solutions for non
profit clients. Muslim women are often pitied for the choice 
they make to put on a Hijab ([for] modesty, but to Westerners, 
it is often thought of as the scarf)," explained Susan Hagan.
In this piece, students, including Emma van Niekerk, worked 
with Dalia Mogehed to redefine hijab so that it would be better 
understood by non-Muslim women. In the piece, the positive 
features began to become clearer, while the physical features 
became fuzzier. The final product emphasized the qualities 
that the client believed gave women power.

---------------------------------------------------

Hagans situation is unique in that she has been at Carnegie 
Mellon since 1995 but only last year transitioned from the 
role of doctoral student to that of professor. The transition 
had to happen gradually, she said: The day I defended I 
didnt feel like I crossed over a threshold. I had satisfied 
all the requirements but I hadnt satisfied some internal 
requirement. Over this year Ive come to something I feel... 
Im ready to publish on. Hagans increased direction in 
her research is a testimony to the benefit of what a year of 
teaching has added to her perspective on the work.
What Students Can Add to the Work
Yeung and his colleague, Erik Thiessen, know what its 
like to be sitting in a students desk in their classrooms. 
After all, it wasnt so long ago that they were in the same 
position. So when they do their research, both solicit the 
help of undergraduates. Yeung even teaches a researchtraining course for first-year and sophomore students. 
Because of the course requirement for students enrolled 
in psychology classes to participate in three one-hour 
research experiments, theyre never short of interest, 
either.
} Perhaps because these young professors were so recently 
students themselves, they see the impact of interacting 
with students as highly influential in their work. A student 
may open up the possibilities in a fresh field by suggesting 
ideas the professors never thought of. The research areas 
are so new that there are still possibilities that have no 
been explored. In short, 20 or 100 heads are better than 
one.
Hagan is excited by how much she can learn from her 
students. I benefit so much from my students and I enjoy 
that interaction, I really do learn a lot, she said, noting 
how teaching enhanced her knowledge of the research 
she was conducting. The challenge students bring is 
probably more helpful than they know.
Yeung and Thiessen also discussed the benefits of having 
students provide new perspectives to their research. As 
Yeung found, Its really exciting to hear about what 
people think about this sort of stuff and what they think 
about the interesting questions. Its a really good reminder 
to me personally about what outside the people outside 
the field think is interesting.
Giving guidance
In addition to the research opportunities, these professors 
are also excellent mentors to students who do not yet 
know what they want to study. Because the professors 
have had to struggle through formulating a dissertation, 
they are close to the problem of focus that can enter a
students mind. Students often question which direction 
they will take their majors or their own related interests.
Thiessen explained that he started off as a physics major 
at Stanford but was turned off by the long, laborious 
experiments. When you want to do work in physics, 
he explained, you go into a lab and do experiments and 
it takes a long time. When you are a psychologist, you 
can often do an experiment in a week or two. So theres 
something about asking questions and having answers 
really quickly that appeals to me about psychology. 
Thiessen understands first-hand the quest to find 
something you can relate to but makes you happy, he 
managed to stay in the scientific community, but in a way 
that was more rewarding to him.
Yeung had a similar experience in college, where he 
intended to be a biology major before considering 
zoology. Then I found that the areas I was interested

Erik Thiessen sits on a children's alphabet puzzle in his Margaret 
Morrison lab. Thiessen studies language and communication in infants.
in in zoology were complex human behavior. So kind 
of gradually, my interest developed into what it is now: 
cognitive psychology focusing specifically on what 
goes on in the brain as we perceive the brain and move 
around, says Yeung.
Hagan also found herself experiencing a large transition 
from a time when she was unsure of what she wanted to 
study to a more focused approach. As a graduate student, 
she said, you were not always expected to verbalize 
what you were working on, but as a doctoral student she 
gained more structure. Its really difficult, she said of 
determining her focus. It takes a lot of back trading and 
clarification. Then, as you study the field you get close to 
what it is you want to do that is different than what they 
[others in the field] have done.
Taking a closer look
New professors can offer many things to their students 
in the field of research and beyond. Their enthusiasm 
adds a new dynamic to their class and makes their classes 
enjoyable to students. Undoubtedly, first year professors 
enthusiasm becomes unmatched when their classes touch 
upon the particular areas of their current research.
They are not only able to give students great references 
to learn from, they are able to give first hand accounts 
of what is going on in the field at that very moment. As 
Hagan noted, having command of your research interests 
is a very situated sense of command and she believes 
that in three to four years she will look back and say I 
didnt know anything then, because she will have gained 
so much knowledge from teaching.
Students should not overlook these teachers on the basis 
of their inexperience as professors because they are 
often the up-and-coming leaders in their field. Sure, they 
might not have reached tenure status yet, but they still 
are extremely knowledgeable within their field and offer 
some of the best opportunities for students to get involved 
with research.

The aura around Aurora
Designers, models, and dancers make the SPIRIT fashion show come together
Music blared as hundreds of students, alumni, 
and University of Pittsburgh students poured into 
the Rangos Ballroom for the SPIRIT fashion show, 
Aurora.
With music pumping and the audience cheering, 
models took the stage in outfits ranging from summer 
beachwear to formal gowns to student-designed 
creations. The scenes were well choreographed, 
and the show's models exhibited the most energy 
and attitude that this campus has seen in a long 
while.
Becky Armady, a first year H&SS student, modeled 
in the Masquerade, Musicology, and Elements 
scenes. Armady describes when she walked out, 
I was beyond nervous. I started shaking! I was in 
the first scene, and I was the first person to walk 
down the runway so I knew I had to be on point.
I calmed down during the huddle. And I knew we 
had practiced it so well. That made the difference.
Of the many outfits she modeled, Armady said, "My 
favorite outfit has to be from Masquerade. It was a 
short pink, red, and black dress white black tights, 
green legwarmers, and a mask for my arm. I would 
never wear it in real life -1 think thats why I enjoyed 
wearing it."
Armady and the other models described the show 
as exhilarating. The fashion show gave me the 
chance to meet new people that I may not have met 
otherwise, said Armady. In the last two weeks, 
youre together so much that it gets to be like camp. 
On show day we all got really hyper. After dedicating 
so much time to practice, all we wanted to do was 
do it the way we knew how.
Ashley Brown, a member of the fashion show 
committee and after-party co-chair, said that in 
the weeks leading up to the show, the last week 
in particular, countless hours were put into making 
everything run as smoothly as possible.
Browns work paid off, since the after-party was 
packed by 12:45. So many people were standing 
outside that the door had to be closed periodically 
until the people inside the party started moving into 
the Blue Room.

HOROSCOPES
BY LARA VOIGT
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Don't take other peoples opinions too 
seriously. Yes, you might be a little bit OCD, but if your toothbrush needs 
exactly 1000 bristles or the tooth fairy will take all your teeth while you 
sleep, then thats the way its got to be.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Woo! One month to go and guess who still 
doesn't have a girlfriend!! Well... its too late now. Better luck next year.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Carnivals this week, you know what that 
means  no classes, no classes, and most importantly, no classes! (At least 
for four days, so make the most of it.)
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Now that winters over you might want to do 
something about your slightly translucent skin tone. Its warm, so get out 
of that computer cluster and go wander around campus. Youll probably 
notice a few (hundred) new faces, but dont worry  they'll probably be 
just as pasty.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): With a four-day weekend coming up, this could 
be a good time to woo that certain someone youve been after. Just dont 
take her on any romantic spinning rides; you could get an unwanted 
surprise.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Buggy pushers have to run really 
fast, so look closely behind them during a race  hopefully they dropped 
something monetary. But then again, they do run fast, so make sure they 
don't see you.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): When your other horoscope tells you 
youre going to receive an unexpected visitor from your past, pray it isnt 
your Uncle Tommy. Ten to 12 years in jail can change anyone.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): You have bad luck with quickly 
moving objects this week. Im not talking cars, I'm talking Frisbees, 
baseballs, and especially those big red and green balls people throw at the 
little white ball... those things come in packs.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Be the hunter! Go out there 
and snag yourself a guy wandering around Carnival. He may not know it yet, 
but youre the girl hes been waiting for. You just have to persuade him that 
his girlfriend isnt.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Try not to repeat what you did 
last Carnival. No one wants to see you running around naked, even if they 
did double-dog-dare you.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You might want to buddy up to 
your siblings in the near future; youre going to need them. Theyre older, 
wiser," and most importantly, have more money than you.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): It may seem like a good idea, but dont 
you think taking the shrine you made to your physics lab partner out of your 
room is a little risky?

Art Spiegelman: Comix 101
The Byham Theater, mere spitting distance from the North Shore 
in the Cultural District downtown, just played host to Comix 101, a 
lecture by the Pulitzer-prize-winning independent comic artist Art 
Spiegelman. Thanks to the generosity of the Humanities Scholars 
program, about ten students and I had good seats for the show.
Prompdy at 8 pm, Art emerged onstage and lit himself a cigarette. 
Thats why were billing this as a performance and not a lecture, he 
kidded, because in performances they let you smoke. He continued 
to charm everyone by assuring us that his words would be projected 
onto the puff of smoke, like a word-bubble. Everyone had a good 
chuckle.
Art Spiegelman participated in the underground comics movement 
of the 60s and 70s, and became famous amongst eclectic circles 
in 1980 for his underground comic magazine, Raw. At this time 
he began drawing the graphic novel Maus: a powerful book about 
his fathers experience in the Holocaust in which the Nazis were 
represented by cats and the Jews by mice. The first volume, My 
Father Bleeds History, came out in 1986, and the second volume, And 
Here My Troubles Began, was released five years later in 1991. Maus 
earned him the Pulitzer Prize in 1992. He worked for several years 
as a writer and artist for the New Yorker, and is known for several 
controversial covers and his dramatic black-on-black cover following 
the September 11 attacks. Shortly after the attacks, though, he 
resigned from the magazine and worked on a series of full-page 
newspaper comics about the attacks that have been compiled into 
one anthology, In the Shadow of No Towers.
I learned everything I know from comics, he said. I learned how 
to read because I wanted to know if Batman was a good guy or a 
bad guy, and I thought I could figure it out if I could just decode 
the scribbles. Apparently the guys drawing it today still havent 
figured that question out. I learned about sex too, from Betty and 
Veronica...
Art began his proper lecture with a dictionary definition of comics, 
literally. On the lazy afternoon that he actually looked it up, he told 
us, he was amused to find that the dictionary actually had a picture 
of a Nancy strip. Projecting the strip on a large stage screen, he 
formally deconstructed the cartoon elements in a light-hearted and 
slightly pejorative way. His point was that comics have a language, 
structure, and architecture that beelines into our brains. Incidentally, 
the definition of comic according to Art is a narrative sequence of 
images. Narrative, as it turns out, simply means story; and story, 
he told us, has roots in the Greek word history, referring to the 
sequential pictorial reliefs on buildings depicting the life of Christ 
(the worlds first superhero). This is why we refer to floors in 
buildings as stories.
Next, he took a break from the meta-discussion of comics to talk 
about his own experience at the New Yorker: the covers he made, the 
controversy they generated, and ultimately his dissatisfaction with 
making nonsequential, upper-middle-class fluff pieces. September
11 shocked him terribly. I didnt work near there, but just a week 
before, my daughter had begun going to school at the foot of the
towers. As the rest of New York sheepishly found a new normal, 
he remained unable to come to grips. I knew I had to start making 
comics again... I guess disaster is my muse.
What followed in his lecture was a tour de force of comic history, 
beginning with Hogarths image series about moral lessons in the 18th 
century. More importantly, though, was a Swedish schoolteacher in 
the early 19th century who drew several actual graphic novels for 
his class on various topics. These novels demonstrated caricature, 
timing, blurring between typographic and visual elements, and 
story editing that filmmakers wouldnt discover for another century. 
These proto-comics would have been lost to the sands of time, except 
that Goethe (the Oprah Winfrey of his time) called them the birth 
of a new medium and popularized them across Europe. The long
standing taboo that poetry and painting and sculpture could not 
mix according to the European academies was challenged and fell. 
This began a rich cartoon tradition in Europe that wouldnt reach 
America until the turn of the century.
What did bring the idea of cartoons to America was the competition 
between New Yorks two biggest newspapers: Joseph Pulitzers 
New York World and William Randolph Hearsts New York Journal. 
Pulitzer decided to edify the New York Worlds often uneducated 
immigrant readership with full-color reproductions of great 
masterpieces of world art. The garish and off-register results werent 
up to the task, but were fine for outlining drawings with flat colors. 
So, in 1893, the first Sunday color cartoon supplement entered the 
world and elbowed out the High Art planned for the masses. Art 
covered all the imaginative, original cartoonists from this period, 
from Richard Outcaults Hogans Alley to George Herrimans Krazy 
Kat to Winsor McKay's Little Nemo in Slumberland.
Throughout his delivery, Art remained spirited and jovial, but every 
so often struck a note of sad or cynical humor. This was especially 
apparent when he began to talk about comics in the postwar period, 
particularly after Dr. Fredric Werthams pivotal book Seduction of the 
Innocent turned the ornery conservative moral police against comics 
like Horror Stories, Tales from the Crypt, and Mad. It nearly destroyed 
comics as a medium in America forever, reducing them instead to a 
bunch of pre-adolescent male power fantasies.
The torch was picked up by the underground comics scene ten years 
later when R. Crumbs magazine Zap and Arts own Raw entered the 
scene, revitalizing the styles o Mad magazine. The most important 
breakthrough of the underground scene, however, was breaking 
the rule that comics had to be drawn well. Suddenly, anyone could 
draw comics.
Running short of time, he just flew through the rest of his slides: 
Chris Ware is important.... Daniel Clowes is very good. Finally 
he came to the last slide in his lecture: a cartoon of a distressed Art 
Spiegelman with a rain cloud over his head standing uncomfortably 
next to an aggressive, religious Uncle Sam inside the 0 of an 
enormous Oy!
