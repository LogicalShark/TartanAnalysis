Campus debates dramatic 
changes in smoking policy
SABRINA PORTER
News Editor
Cigarette butts on the Cut may 
soon be punishable by a fine. The 
Healthy Campus Task Force pre
sented a proposal Thursday that 
would dramatically change the 
universitys smoking policy. The 
suggested changes would cre
ate designated campus smoking 
areas and enforce prohibition 
through a system of warnings 
and fines. Smoking would be 
prohibited in most of the heavily 
trafficked and residential areas 
on campus, including the Cut, 
athletic and child care facilities, 
and Student Health Services.
The Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity Healthy Campus 2010 Task 
Force is composed of students, 
staff, and faculty. Healthy Cam
pus 2010 is part of a national 
campaign by the American Col
lege Health Association (ACHA) 
to encourage healthy behavior 
at colleges in 28 areas, including 
eating, fitness, drug and alcohol 
use, sexual behavior, and smok
ing, among others. Its aim is for 
colleges to meet specific goals in 
these areas by 2010.
Although the task force is con
cerned with all of these areas,
its members have focused their 
most recent efforts on smoking.
As tobacco is the number one 
preventable behavior [in Healthy 
Campus], it immediately rose to 
become our top priority, said 
Anita Barkin, director of Student 
Health Services (SHS).
Barkin represented the task 
force with Kristine Cecchetti, a 
health educator in SHS, as they 
presented the smoking change 
proposal to students, faculty, and 
staff at Thursdays Student Sen
ate Spotlight Series.
Were trying to get away from 
the 20-foot rule, Barkin said. 
The direction were suggesting 
is designated smoking areas.... 
There is no enforcement in the 
current policy.
Carnegie Mellons current pol
icy prohibits smoking within 20 
feet of all building entrances.
According to Barkin, the two 
key parts of the new plan are con
tainment and enforcement.
Containment will come in the 
form of carefully designated 
smoking areas on every part of 
campus.
In the plans initial stages,

In many ways, it is hard to be
lieve that Carnegie Mellon was 
ranked the most politically apa
thetic college or university by 
The Princeton Review in 2002. 
Since then, the air at Carnegie 
Mellon has become more politi
cally charged  not only has the 
university been bumped from 
the list entirely, but its been stu
dents themselves who have led 
the transformation by sporting 
buttons and t-shirts in support 
of the prospective presidential 
candidates and manning voter 
registration tables, encourag
ing their peers to register or 
re-register to become eligible to 
vote in the Pennsylvania prima
ries on April 22.
We want to spread the en
ergy and excitement we have 
to campus to get people ready
for the primary, said Maria 
Mauro, a sophomore biology 
and political science major and 
co-founder of Carnegie Mellon 
Students for Barack Obama.
Students are not the only 
ones preparing themselves.
Both Hillary Clinton and Ba
rack Obama made appearances 
in the Pittsburgh area over the 
last two weeks. Clinton spoke 
before a crowd of thousands at 
Soldiers and Sailors in Oakland 
the night of Saturday, March 15, 
while Obama paid a visit to an 
audience of close to 1000 people 
at Beaver County Community 
College in nearby Monaca, Pa. 
on the following Monday.
In addition, Chelsea Clinton 
held a question-and-answer ses
sion on Hillarys behalf at Point 
Park University on Wednesday, 
March 12. John McCain has yet 
to make it to the area.
Some of these events were
held during Carnegie Mellons 
spring break, making it difficult 
for students to attend.
However, more students have 
been taking action on campus. 
Students for* Barack Obama, 
which was formed last year and 
became active on campus about 
two months ago, has focused 
almost entirely on on-campus 
voter registration. As of last 
Thursday, the group had regis
tered several hundred voters in 
last week alone, and stationed 
themselves at Saturdays Greek 
Sing to register more, according 
to Mauro.
I see this as a turning point 
for our generation and an op
portunity for us to take hold of 
the direction our country is tak
ing, and that is the reason that 
Barack resonates with me so 
much and the vision he has for

IBM just made a big financial 
investment, not in the stock 
market but with Carnegie Mel
lon students. The company 
gave a series of research grants 
last week aimed at collabora
tion in software development.
The grants were awarded to 
faculty who will work closely 
with students to utilize IBMs 
new Jazz platform, a platform 
which was developed to al
low software creation through 
information sharing across 
global time zones and tech
nical departments. The Jazz 
platform supports a number of 
programs, all of which address 
the increasing globalization of 
the software creation process.
Jim Herbsleb, associate 
professor in the Institute for 
Software Research (ISR) was 
awarded the grant at Carnegie 
Mellon. He will be working 
alongside Anita Sarma, a post
doctoral associate in the ISR, 
as well as a number of com
puter science students.

Scottie dog becomes universitys official pet and mascot
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
ANDREW PETERS
Publisher
Today, Carnegie Mellon an
nounces that actor Bill Cosby 
will give the university a real, 
live Scottie dog to be the of
ficial Tartan mascot. Cosby, a 
known lover of Scotties, deliv
ered Carnegie Mellons com
mencement speech in 2007.
The Scottie, whose name is 
Maggie after Margaret Mag
gie Morrison, will live with 
professor Larry Cartwright, 
who has cared for five Scotties 
over the past 30 years, accord
ing to Media Relations.
In 2007, it was one of Cart
wrights Scotties, Murray, that 
Cosby trotted around Gesling 
Stadium at commencement.
Maggie, who is only six 
months old, was raised by 
Sheila Scott, a breeder in 
Calgary, Canada. Accord
ing to Cartwright, she will 
regularly attend football
games, homecoming events, 
commencements, and other 
university-wide functions.
Beginning today, the entire 
campus community will have 
the opportunity to take part
in a survey to give the new 
mascot that appears at sport
ing events an official name. 
Students, faculty, staff, and 
alumni can log on to www. 
cmu.edu/mascot to take part 
in the survey and to obtain 
more information.
The name of the mascot will 
be announced with the debut 
of the new mascot costume at
3 p.m. on Thursday, April 17, 
during the Spring Carnival 
opening ceremony. The mas
cot will be present for all of 
Carnivals main events.
Jennifer Church, dean of 
Student Affairs, and Susan 
Bassett, director of athletics 
and physical education, co
chair the Mascot Identity Task 
Force that has coordinated 
discussion and decision-mak
ing on the new mascot since 
2006. The Scottie officially 
premiered as the universitys 
mascot in graphic form on 
Nov. 10, 2007 at a football 
game against Washington & 
Lee.
Maggie is expected to make 
her campus debut in fall 2008, 
after a summer of training 
with Cartwright.
Robots look to the moon
DAWN WANG
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon faculty and 
students have been hard at work 
building a robot, called Red 
Rover, that they anticipate will 
land on the surface of the moon 
before 2012.
Carnegie Mellon has part
nered with technology company 
Raytheon and the University of 
Arizona under Astrobotic Tech
nology, Inc., a company formed 
by Carnegie Mellon professor 
William Red Whittaker. Under 
Whittakers leadership, the team 
seeks to win the Google Lunar X 
PRIZE.
Whittaker is the Fredkin Re
search Professor of Robotics at the 
Carnegie Mellon Robotics Insti
tute and the founder of the Field 
Robotics Center and the Robotics 
Engineering Consortium, both 
at this university. He is also the 
Chairman and CEO of Astrobotic 
Technology, Inc. and oversees the 
project within and outside of Car
negie Mellon.
Most recently, he led the Tartan 
Racing team that won the 2007
DARPA Urban Challenges $2 mil
lion prize with their car, Boss.
In an interview posted on the 
video-sharing website YouTube, 
Whittaker spoke of the philosophy 
behind what he deems a truly suc
cessful project.
In any successful mission, if 
you havent done everything, you 
havent done anything, he said.
Whittaker has now focused his 
attentions on the Google Lunar X 
PRIZE.
The Google Lunar X PRIZE is 
an international competition to 
land a robot on the moon, allow 
it to move 500 meters over the lu
nar surface, and transfer images 
and data back to the Earth. Mon
etary prizes will be given to the 
winners  $20 million and $10 
million respectively for the first 
and second to land on the moon, 
if accomplished by 2012. The 
prizes are only valid until 2014, 
at which point the prize amounts 
drop to $15 million and $5 million 
apiece.

policymaking. Attendees share ideas on 
methods and techniques for the improve
ment of city economies and infrastructure 
with references to energy sources, health 
services, robotics, and electronic graphic

amounts of growth in venture-funded
businesses.
Today, the Duquesne Club will host a 
pre-symposium press conference featur
ing State Secretary of Community and 
Economic Development Dennis Yablonsky 
and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. A 
VIP reception following the conference 
will focus on ways in which to connect 
business, policy, and academic fields to 
benefit the global economy.

Researchers study cell phones
Professors and experts share knowledge of business, research
A recent study by Carnegie Mellon 
researchers has confirmed that hands
free or voice-activated cell phones are 
still dangerous for drivers.
Although other activities, such as 
eating or listening to the radio, can 
also distract drivers, researchers argue 
that distractions caused by cell phones 
are more significant because they re
quire social interactions.
To quantify the potential harm that 
cell phones pose for drivers, Carnegie 
Mellon scientists enlisted the help of 
29 study volunteers.
While inside an MRI brain scanner, 
each individual used a driving simula
tor to steer a virtual car along steep, 
winding roads; at the same time, the  
participants were asked to decide
whether a sentence was true or false.
Researchers found that the vol
unteers asked to interpret sentences 
showed a 37 percent decrease in ac
tivity of the brains parietal lobe, a 
section associated with skills such as 
spatial sense and navigation, both of 
which are needed for driving.
This data disproves the previous 
idea that the brain should be able to 
drive and listen simultaneously be
cause the tasks are associated with 
two different networks.

Task Force proposes designated campus smoking areas
HEALTHY, fromAl
area defined by Doherty, Wean, 
Hamerschlag, Porter, and Baker 
Halls), and the immediate 
exteriors of all residential 
buildings would be designated as 
non-smoking areas, among other 
places on campus.
The job of enforcing the new 
policies will fall to the University 
Police. If the proposal is enacted, 
the as-of-yet undecided system of 
fines and warnings will be insti
tuted by the officers.
Students had mixed reactions 
to the proposed policy changes at 
Thursdays Senate meeting.
Some students commented on 
the vagueness of the designated 
areas and the ways in which they 
would be marked, which, accord
ing to Barkin, would be by physi
cal signs.
There was additional concern 
as to whether or not all areas 
could fall under jurisdiction, 
such as Greek housing, which is 
subject to different fees and resi
dential policies.
Another potential problem 
brought up was that of enforce
ment since University Police 
spend different amounts of time 
at different residential areas on 
and off campus.
Additionally, sidewalks and 
specific off-campus land does not 
belong to Carnegie Mellon, and
thus cannot be included in Uni
versity Police jurisdiction.
Still, some students maintained 
that the effects of second-hand 
smoking on non-smokers is 
enough to warrant the policy.
The idea of designated smok
ing areas and even smoke-free 
campuses is not a new one nation
wide or in Pittsburgh. According 
to SHS data, at least 105 colleges 
nationwide have enacted smokefree colleges, and Carnegie Mel
lon is one of 320 campuses with 
smoke-free policies within resi
dential buildings.
Carlow University began des
ignating smoking areas in 2007 
and the University of Pittsburgh 
is hoping to more strongly en
force its 15-foot rule, which 
prohibits smoking closer than 
15 feet to any entranceway. The 
University of Pittsburgh Medi
cal Center has declared all of its 
medical building and hospital 
campuses smoke-free and offers 
educational materials and sup
port for those hoping to quit.
Cecchetti used a nationwide 
ACHA survey to explain some of 
the reasons behind the proposal 
at Carnegie Mellon.
According to Cecchetti, the 
most interesting survey data, and 
one that played a role in the task 
forces decision to move forward, 
was the discrepancy between 
student perceptions versus actual
tabulations of smoking behavior.
What generally tends to hap
pen with college health issues 
is that students tend to overes
timate what other people are 
doing, and that happens with 
drugs, alcohol, and sexual be
havior, and it certainly happened 
with smoking, Cecchetti said.
According to the survey, stu
dents guessed that 16.5 percent 
of their peers were not smok
ers and 22 percent were daily 
smokers.
In fact, 75.7 percent of students 
reported being non-smokers and 
13.9 percent reported smoking 
occasionally, but not in the past 
month. Only 1.5 percent called 
themselves daily smokers, a fig
ure dramatically smaller than 
the students perception.
When the survey asked for ad
ditional comments on smoking 
behavior, many students com
plained of smoke coming into 
their rooms through their win
dows, a concern that has been 
directly addressed in the new 
policy.
Both Barkin and Cecchetti 
commented on the prevalence 
of smoking butts on campus. 
According to Barkin, the esti
mated cost of cleaning them up is 
$220 per day and approximately 
$80,000 per year.
The task force had drafted a 
proposal to make the campus
smoke-free last school year. 
However, strong student opinion 
against such measures caused 
them to re-evaluate their pro
posed policy.
Barkin noted that a smoke-free 
campus is not out of the question 
in the future. We believe that we 
are ultimately heading in that di
rection, she said. But we would 
go through the same process for 
any other changes.
However, some students main
tain that this proposed policy is 
not advantageous to all parties 
involved.
Joey Cordes, a sophomore de
sign major and Senate member, 
spoke for many when he men
tioned the issue as a dictation 
of students choices. Students 
should be given the right to 
choose for themselves, he said.
At the conclusion of the dis
cussion, Jared Itkowitz, a junior 
business administration major 
Student Senate chair, took an 
informal straw poll of senators. 
The voting was 17-9 in favor of 
further development of the pro
posal by the task force.
The Healthy Campus 2010 
Task Force hopes to finalize its 
proposal and bring it to the Stu
dent Senate, Graduate Student 
Assembly, Faculty Senate, and 
Presidents Council in the coming 
months, so that the policy can be 
instituted as early as fall 2008.
Allison Piper/Assistant Photo Editor
At the Student Senate meeting Thursday, students heard the Healthy Campus proposal to designate smoking areas on campus and shared their 
reactions with the task force. A straw poll that followed the discussion showed students in favor of continuing with the proposal by 17-9.
IBM facilitates research
IBM, fromAl
received grants were Brown 
University, North Carolina State 
University, Saarland University 
in Germany, and the Univer
sity of Calgary in Canada, all of 
which were asked to investigate 
different areas of the Jazz plat
form.
Carnegie Mellon was given the 
grant to study ways to enhance 
the platforms collaboration ca
pabilities through evaluating its 
dependency and means of com
munication.
According to Li-Te Cheng, a 
research scientist in the Collab
orative User Experience Group 
at IBM, the importance of Carn
egie Mellons research lies in its 
study of coordination between 
developers allowing all mem
bers of the development team to 
clearly understand project goals 
and share their suggestions and 
ideas.
Karen Lilia, from Global Com
munications for IBM, helped 
explain the reasoning behind 
the grants.
Software development has 
greatly changed due to global
ization, especially in the ways in 
which programming is handled, 
she said. In the past, it has been 
a rather isolated process done by 
a small group of professionals in 
only one country. However, to
days software requires the col
laboration of developers from all 
around the world.
Jazz has the power to unite 
these global teams through one 
platform in a centralization of all 
the development work involved. 
Developers in Japan and the 
U.S., for example, can all work 
from Jazz, which serves as a uni
versal software platform, thus 
increasing communication and 
productivity.
U.S. universities may not be 
prepared for the rapid transfor
mation that is occurring, Lilia 
said. Moreover, the evolving in
dustry threatens U.S. competi
tiveness in the technology in
dustry. With fewer U.S. students 
majoring in technology each 
year and software developers 
continuing to spread across the 
globe, the problem for the coun
try is only increasing.
As the worlds second larg
est software company, IBM has 
reacted to these changes in its 
creation of the Jazz platform 
and in offering grants to univer
sities to explore the platforms 
possibilities.
Its important for our stu
dents to understand the global 
dynamics of software develop
ment and Jazz provides us with 
a platform for that, said Frank 
Maurer, head of the Agile Soft
ware Engineering group at the 
University of Calgary, in a March 
17 IBM press release.
According to www.jazz.net, 
the platforms name came from 
its creators expectations. The 
website makes a comparison be
tween working on software as a 
part of a team and performing in 
a band.
Ultimately, the goal of the Jazz 
platform, according to the site, 
can be likened to the fine tuning 
of a band; creators of the plat
form aim to build software more 
effectively while also making it 
more productive and pleasant.
The platforms official website 
open to the public and is home to 
the early Jazz-supported prod
ucts available for download.
Cheng pointed out the collab
orative nature of the platform 
sets it apart from past inno
vations and other software 
platforms.
Jazz is not just a technology, 
it is also a community, Cheng 
said. A team of students should 
get the feel of how a software 
team can get work done to
gether.
IBM has worked with Carn
egie Mellon in the past.
IBM was crucial in the de
velopment of the Andrew 
network in the 1980s and re
mains an industry partner to this 
day, providing research grants 
and panel discussions at the uni
versity, among other means of 
support.
In accordance with this most 
recent Jazz grant, an IBM re
search team will be closely 
collaborating with Carnegie Mel
lon. The grant lasts for a year, so 
publishable results maybe avail
able as early as next March.

The Carnegie Mellon Code maintains that violations of community standards are taken 
seriously. The University Committee on Discipline (UDC) is a hearing board made up of 
faculty, staff, and students that hears cases of serious, alleged violations of community 
standards. The UDC makes recommendations for action if a student is found responsible for a
charge.
It is important to note that not all disciplinary cases are referred to a hearing board. In fact, 
during the 2006-2007 academic year 249 cases resulted in a mediated agreement between the 
parties involved (these agreements most often included completion of community service hours, 
planning or participating in educational programs, and placement on probation). This number 
represents 96% of all cases
The table below highlights UDC cases that occurred during the Fall 2006 and Spring 2007 
semesters. In accordance with state and federal laws protecting the privacy ofstudentrecords,

Carnegie Mellon project aims to land 
robot on the moon by the year 2012
MOON, from A1
expanding beyond governmentfunded projects into privately 
funding ventures.
As universities such as Carn
egie Mellon are becoming more 
technologically advanced, the 
process of expanding these 
innovations to commercial 
enterprises beyond the univer
sity becomes increasingly com
plex, according to Michele Gittleman, a project manager in the 
Field Robotics Center.
Thats why we have a tech 
transfer office  so that the 
big ideas can make it out of the 
university and into the world so 
the entrepreneurs can run with 
them, Gittleman said.
Gittleman recognized the in
tensity it takes to build a robot to 
land on the moon.
You have to really want it to 
win.... you have to have the pas
sion to stick it out, she said.
The X PRIZE has caused ex
citement and commotion not 
just in the world of robotics and 
technology, but also within the 
Carnegie Mellon community.
In addition to a group of fac
ulty, the majority of the students 
working on the project are at the 
masters and Ph.D. level. How
ever, a number of undergradu
ates are also involved in the 
project.
Astrobotic Technologys new 
role as a spin-off of the univer
sity, rather than a separate com
pany, allows for more student 
involvement on the project.
First-year mechanical engi
neering major Ray Barsa has al
ready started contributing to the 
robotics project. He is one of the 
select group of undergraduates 
involved in the project, and as 
a first-year his position is espe
cially rare.
Barsa is currently enrolled 
in the graduate level class Ad
vanced Mobile Robot Develop
ment, which he decided to take 
after hearing about Carnegie 
Mellons X PRIZE team. His role 
covers working on mobility sys
tems for Red Rover.
Driving a robot on the moon 
is probably one of the biggest 
engineering challenges.... Ive 
learned so much from the class 
.... [It] forces you to learn on 
your own, and theres so many
resources available, Barsa said.
I just feel really lucky to be 
part of the class .... I had hoped 
to work on projects like that 
one day, and its incredible to be 
working on them already [as a 
first-year], he added.
John Thornton, a research 
engineer in the Field Robotics 
Center working on. the project, 
echoed Barsas enthusiasm.
Its happening in our own 
backyard.... Its incredible to be 
part of something bigger than all 
of us, he said.
Thornton said Carnegie Mel
lon students already have the 
right combination of techni
cal prowess, passion for excel
lence, and world-class research 
resources needed to get to the 
moon.
Now we just throw all that 
in a pot, stir it up, and see what 
comes out, he said. A robot that 
wins the first prize of $20 million 
wouldnt be so bad.

ing part of the project can

Conference features discussions on corporations and environmental responsibility
ENVIRONMENT, fromAl
ago, a similar program was held on en
vironmental justice and was also funded 
by the Steinbrenner Institute.
Also similarly to last year, three units 
of course credit will be available to stu
dents who attend all of the weekends 
events. Students can enter the course 
by registering for 99-522: Corporations 
and Environmental Responsibility.
The events include a number of small 
group discussions and lectures given by 
environmental experts.
This weekends speakers will include 
Mary Beth Buchanan, the United States 
attorney for the Western District of 
Pennsylvania, and Rob Bear, the direc
tor of environmental affairs at Alcoa.
Topics to be covered include environ
mental public policy of corporations,, 
best practices in environmental man
agement, and environmental responsi
bility of corporations.
Peter Madsen, coordinator of the
event and H&SS professor and advisor 
for environmental studies, commented 
on the changes in behavior of corpora
tions concerning the environment and 
the need for such a weekend program.
In the past, many large companies 
took advantage of the environment, 
Madsen said, adding that this caused a 
continual environmental degradation. 
However, since the 1960s, environmen
tal tragedies such as pollutant fires, toxic 
exposure, and oil spills have become in
creasingly public.
According to Madsen, the publicity of 
environmental issues has reached an alltime high.
Corporations have needed to take 
steps to police themselves since a public 
alarm went off exposing their [negative 
environmental effects], he said.
Madsen also noted that being green 
now has taken on additional meaning
 it makes companies more popular or 
trendy. The potential to win over more 
consumers has inspired many compa
nies to take up green methods.
In May 2005, General Electric 
launched the Ecomagination cam
paign aimed at creating environmen
tally friendly products  a campaign 
which has been continually expanding 
its objectives.
Retail stores have also joined in on the 
trend.
In July 2006, Wal-Mart announced 
a green initiative, including activities 
such as recycling and a waste-reduction 
campaign, in addition to manufacturing 
environmentally safe products.
At the end of last year, Whole Foods 
announced that the company will ban 
plastic bags nationwide; instead, the 
company now offers its customers a 
choice between recyclable paper bags 
and reusable canvas bags.
A.C. Gallo, Whole Foods co-president, spoke of the reasoning behind the 
change.
This is something our customers want 
us to do, he said in a USA Today article.
Its central to our core values of caring 
for communities and the environment. 
However, Madsen brought up the con
cern of companies that are green wash
ing, or claiming to be environmentally 
friendly in their marketing without ac
tually doing so.
Corporations need to really consider 
whats more important  profits, or the 
ability to continue producing, said Aus
tin Redwood, a sophomore humanities 
and arts scholar and president of Sus
tainable Earth. Once certain resources 
are gone, they wont return for a very 
long time, which is why its crucial to 
learn how to produce things in a sustain
able manner right now, before we dont 
have the means or time to do so.
This weekends program will address 
the need for corporations to fully carry 
out green initiatives and avoid green 
washing.
Our main goal is to gain clarity as to 
what role corporations did or can play 
in environmental issues and heighten
awareness on this topic. This is open to 
the public and we invite all to come, 
Madsen said.
Kishore Mahubhani, a sophomore civil 
engineering and engineering and public , 
policy double major, added that environ
mental education can be of great benefit 
to students.
Students who have a greater envi
ronmental awareness will be an asset to , 
employers and will be able to change the. 
culture of businesses and their interac- _ 
tions with the environment, he said.
Madsen spoke of the many opportuni
ties available to students to becomeenvironmentally aware at Carnegie Mel-' 
Ion, this conference being only one such 
way.
Things at Carnegie Mellon have 
changed dramatically both in aware
ness and activity. There are many more 
opportunities such as different clubs or 
majors that allow more student activ
ity, he said. Its phenomenal how much 
weve changed.

Students take their votes 
beyond campus grounds
ELECTION, from A1
our country, Mauro said.
Next, the group will continue 
to focus on building its volun
teer base along with excitement 
levels, Mauro said. The orga
nization will be working with 
students at Duquesne Univer
sity, Chatham University, and 
the University of Pittsburgh to 
spread the news.
We all have the same mes
sage and the same goal, Mauro 
said. If you can get everyone 
together, great things are going 
to happen.
Mauro urged students who 
want to become involved in Stu
dents for Barack Obama to email cmuobama@gmail.com.
Zenobia Bell, a junior political 
science major and president of 
College Democrats, had a simi
lar message.
We need to actively vote and 
get actively involved, she said. 
Politically active groups are the 
basis of what gets people into 
politics.
The group recently hosted a 
late-night event in conjunction 
with other politically minded 
groups for which they brought 
in speakers on behalf of Clinton 
and Obama to discuss the impor
tance of getting young people to 
vote. They also assisted in voter
registration efforts during the 
fall semester.
Bell could not endorse a spe
cific candidate on behalf of Col
lege Democrats.
While students supporting 
Clinton have not been as visible 
on campus, they are equally as 
fervent in their support of their 
chosen candidate.
I dont think Hillarys ex
perience disqualifies her from 
making change in our country, 
stated William Hum, a Ph.D. 
candidate in chemical engineer
ing and Clinton supporter, via 
e-mail.
Hillary has a more sensible 
and realistic plan to get out of 
Iraq that involves extensive 
planning and care, which I think 
shows that she is a very practical 
leader, he added.
While Hum was unable to at
tend Clintons speech on March 
15, he said he is trying to work 
with the Clinton campaign 
headquarters to get Chelsea 
Clinton to visit the Carnegie 
Mellon campus and aid in voter 
registration.
In the past, Carnegie Mellon 
has held rallies for presidential 
candidates, hosting President 
George W. Bush in 2004.
With Election Day on Nov. 4, 
2008, there is a long road ahead

Declare Yourself {www.declareyourself.com) is a non-par
tisan organization designed to 
encourage 18- to 24- year olds 
to register to vote. The website 
provides up-to-the minute elec
tion coverage, including both 
national news and state-by-state 
information about primaries and 
other area events.
In addition, students can use 
the site to register to vote online 
in any of the 50 states. Based in 
Los Angeles, the organization 
has major celebrity sponsorship, 
and young celebrity voters such 
as Hayden Panettierre, America 
Ferrera, Wilmer Valderrama, 
and Christopher Charles MintzPlasse (better known as McLovin 
of Superbad) star in short videos 
and make frequent media ap
pearances on behalf of the orga
nization.
The group will be hosting 
a concert to increase political 
consciousness in Pittsburgh this
July.
Rock the Vote (www.rockthevote.com) places similar em
phasis on getting young people 
to vote on Election Day. The web
site includes links to register as 
well as information about how 
to become a campaign volunteer 
in different areas of the country. 
The group was founded in 1990 
and is based in Washington, D.C.
Project Vote Smart (www: 
votesmart.org) encourages 
citizens, both young and old, to 
take an active role in reforming 
democracy in the United States. 
The project often takes stances 
on issues that are in opposition 
to the views and actions of the 
current administration.
I think it is important for 
young people to get involved. We 
as young people have a chance to 
control how our futures will be 
by electing the next president, 
stated William Hum, a Ph.D. can
didate in chemical engineering, 
in an e-mail.
Hum is a Clinton supporter, 
and acknowledged that he will 
be voting in the Pennsylvania 
primary. He added that young 
voters are more excited this year 
than ever before, particularly for 
the Obama and Clinton competi
tion.
Maria Mauro, a sophomore 
biology and political science ma
jor and co-founder of Students 
for Barack Obama, and Zenobia 
Bell, a junior political science 
major and president of College 
Democrats, agreed.
Youth is running this cam
paign. We want people to take 
ownership of this campaign and 
take a vested interest in politics. 
We are going to control how the 
next generation sees our coun
try, Mauro said.
People always say politicians 
dont care about young people,
but young people may not care 
about politicians, Bell said. 
There are historical things hap
pening in terms of the role of 
youth, and we need to make sure 
we get our voices heard.
Bell acknowledged that the 
youth vote and all voters particu
larly in Pennsylvania will play 
an important role in this years 
election, as the winners of the 
Pennsylvania primary are often 
indicative of the final national 
results.
But while certain groups of 
students are politically, active 
on campus with regard to the 
upcoming election, the Carn
egie Mellon student community 
seems to have trouble keeping 
students involved in politics in 
non-election times. College Re
publicans is now defunct, and 
College Democrats, led by Bell, 
collapsed after four members of 
the groups executive board quit.
Now, Bell wants to take steps 
to rebuild the executive board 
and connect with students at 
Carlow College and the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh to plan bigger 
events to raise students political 
awareness.
Mauro believes the Carnegie 
Mellon campus is anything but 
apathetic.
People know a lot more than 
we give them credit for, and be
ing undecided isnt being apa
thetic, she said. This is an in
telligent place. People know a lot 
and are questioning specifics.
While its too late to register to 
vote in time for the Pennsylvania 
primary, students can still regis
ter to vote in the general election 
this November. To register to vote 
online in Pennsylvania, visit the 
Department of States website at 
www.dos.state.pa.us/voting. To

The University of Pittsburgh 
Center for Vaccine Research 
received an $11.4 million grant 
from the Gates Foundation to 
.research how to control the 
effects of tuberculosis (TB)  a 
bacterial infection that targets 
pulmonary function. .
The project will incorporate 
new imaging methods, such as 
positron emission tomography 
(PET), in order to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of 
TB treatments.
New treatments will seek to 
shorten treatment time, lower 
cost, and increase availability.
While TB is quite rare in the 
U.S., it infects approximately 
one-third of the world popula

Pacemakers 
strengthen heart
A Johns Hopkins study is the 
first to investigate the biologi
cal effects that implanted pace
makers have on the heart. The 
study focused on 22 dogs, all 
with damaged hearts.
In cases of congestive heart 
failure, the heart muscle weak
ens and becomes unable to 
regularly contract in order to 
pump blood to the rest of the 
body.
Researchers found that while 
the pacemaker is effective in 
controlling heart rate, it also 
produces chemical changes 
that actually improve the heart 
muscle and restore heart pro
tein activity to its normal state.
In dogs without pacemakers, 
the disease led to changes in 
production levels of proteins 
that controlled heart cell sur
vival and death. However, the 
installation of the pacemaker 
acted as a drug to stabilize 
these abnormal protein levels.

A recent study has shown that 
at least one in four teenage girls 
in the U.S. has a sexually trans

which affected 18 percent of the 
girls studied.
In early stages, many STDs 
can be cured with a dose of anti
biotics. However, symptoms do 
not automatically appear at the 
onset of the infections. Those 
that go untreated can lead to

In todays demanding life
style, not being able to answer 
a phone call does not simply 
mean a missed call. It can be 
the source of great personal 
and professional inconvenience. 
However, a new study suggests 
that sometimes a ringing cell 
phone has to be ignored.
Recent findings by a team of 
Carnegie Mellon re^archers led 
by professor Marcel Just have 
shown that merely listening to 
a person over the cell phone, 
even with hands-free devices, 
can hamper a persons driving 
ability.
In the past, drivers wishing 
to talk on their cell phones typi
cally had one hand on the wheel 
while holding the phone in the 
other. While hands-free devices 
allow drivers to keep drive with 
two hands, recent research sug
gests the potential danger of cell 
phones to drivers remains con
stant.
We wanted to see how using 
language during driving affects 
not just the driving but the brain 
activity during driving, Just 
said.
The researchers recorded 
activity in the brain of partici
pants using functional mag
netic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
while they navigated a car along 
a virtual road. According to a 
Carnegie Mellon press release, 
activity was measured in 20,000 
brain locations.
Timothy Keller, a post-doctoral research associate, explained 
that brain activity was monitored 
during two different experi
ments. In the controlled experi
ment, subjects were allowed to
align each candidates beliefs with 
their own.
Understanding this dilemma, 
computer science graduate stu
dent Bryant Lee generated Vote 
Chooser (www.votechooser.
com), an interactive, non-partisan 
quiz website that helps potential
virtually navigate the car with
out any distraction. This tested 
how well people drive when they 
can focus entirely on the road.
In the next case, the subjects 
listened to outside input.
People were asked to navi
gate a car by using [mice] in 
their right hands and were asked 
to respond to simple true or false 
questions by using [mice] in their 
left hands, Keller said. This test
ed how a listening distraction 
can affect a drivers ability.
A comparison between the 
results .showed that during the 
dual task of listening and driving, 
the brain activity in the naviga
tion areas of the brain decreased 
by 37 percent as compared to the 
task involving just driving.
If there is language going in 
your brain, it will consume some 
<
voters choose which candidate to 
vote for in the 2008 U.S. presiden
tial elections. The website pres
ents the positions of Democratic 
candidates Barack Obama and 
Hillary Clinton, and Republican 
candidates John McCain and Ron 
Paul, on critical issues such as the
resources for its processing, 
Just explained.
According to the teams 
research paper, titled A Decrease 
in Brain Activation Associated 
With Driving When Listening 
to Someone Speak, the dual
faceted act of driving and listen
ing resulted in a reduction in 
activation mainly in the bilateral 
parietal and occipital areas of 
the brain. Since these areas are 
involved in spatial and visual 
processing, decreased activation 
in these areas inevitably leads to 
poor driving performance.
Just explained that the quality 
of driving was measured by two 
aspects: how well the drivers 
maintained their lanes and how 
many times they went off the 
road. Although the program did 
not let the cars veer completeIraq war, tax cuts, and national 
healthcare policies.
My website makes it easier 
[for the public] to do research 
on what the candidates positions 
are, said Lee, who is completing a
 ly off the road, the number of 
times the cars hit the curbs was 
counted. This number increased 
by 50 percent when the drivers 
were listening and driving. The 
drivers also tended to weave out 
of their lanes more frequently 
when they were listening while 
driving.
As alarming as this sounds, 
the story in the real world is 
much worse.
We didnt have any other 
vehicles on our simulated road, 
Keller said. He explained that 
the situation on a real road 
would be much worse as the 
driver would have to keep track 
of many other aspects besides 
lane maintenance or staying on 
the road.

Paperbacks mix with 
the Internet
Penguin Books has launched 
a new digital writing project 
called We Tell Stories.
The project consists of six 
Penguin authors who create a 
story each, and then prompt 
readers to go online to find clues 
within the story.
The six-week project will con
clude with the finding of all 
the online clues for the six sto
ries. The reader will be then 
be directed to a hidden seventh 
story and become eligible for 
prizes.
This is Penguins latest effort 
to get an online audience in a 
world where more people read 
online than actually picking up 
a physical copy of the text.
Penguin has other online 
projects, such as providing for 
free, the first chapters of books 
formatted for Blackberry, iPod, 
and laptop screens.

China shuts down 
YouTube
Web surfers in China have 
been blocked from viewing vid
eo-sharing websites including 
the popular YouTube. Videos 
of the recent protests in Tibet, 
which were posted on YouTube, 
were unavailable to viewers as 
they were deemed to carry sen
sitive information.
Chinese video-sharing web
sites have already been sub
jected to such regulation.
New rules that have been 
effective since Jan. 31 claim 
that Chinese websites must 
report or remove videos that 
threaten national security or 
have pornographic content.
Following this rule, 25 web
sites were shut down and inves
tigations are being carried out 
regarding 32 other websites.
This tightened Internet 
security is a result of the from 
upcoming Beijing Olympics, 
prior to which the government 
does not want any adverse pub
licity that might hamper the 
event.

study light-scattering particles
A year of adding polymers to nanopar
ticles and testing their opacity left chemistry 
Ph.D. student Lindsay Bombalski frustrated. 
Although she was using a standard procedure 
to test the particles and characterize them 
by how much light they scatter, two samples 
were not giving her any signal at all, as 
though they had no opacity.
At no point did we think we were look
ing at- something interesting, said Michael 
Bockstaller, assistant professor of materials 
science and engineering who worked with 
Bombalski and chemistry professor Krzysztof 
Matyjaszewski on the project.
As it turns out, they discovered that that 
something could be used to improve prod
uct packaging, windshields, and sunblock.
Lindsay wanted to understand why the 
technology wouldnt work out, Bockstaller 
said. This led to redefining her thesis, to 
understand this phenomenon, he added.
Particle additives such as polymers are 
often added to particles in other materials 
to increase heat resistance or mechanical 
strength of materials. However, the problem 
With this technique is that the reinforced par
ticles scatter, altering the particles original 
appearance and making them virtually unus
able for any matter that requires light to pass 
through.
This scattering is caused by the change in 
the particles refractive indexan assessment 
of how fast light travels within a material  
when the inorganic particles are added to an 
organic solution. The researchers found that 
by planning a target refractive index, they 
could eliminate the scattering of particles.
Bombalski' likened the phenomenon to how 
a straw appears bent as it is immersed in 
water, which is the result of the straw going 
from the refractive index of air to the refrac
tive index of water.
In our case, we made the air and the water 
match, Bombalski said.
After two and a half years of research, 
the teams findings were published in the 
most recent edition of Advanced Materials 
magazine. In addition to Bockstaller, 
Matyjaszewski, and Bombalski, who graduat
ed last December, other researchers included 
two current graduate students: Hongchen 
Dong, a Ph.D. student in chemistry, and 
Jessica Listak, a Ph.D. student in materials 
science and engineering.

At times, even the best of play
ers may fall prey to an injury they 
never cared to check. Tennis elbow 
-is one such injury which can affect 
anyone and, if overlooked, may 
lead to chronic pain refraining the 
injured from lifting or gripping 
objects.
As the name suggests, playing 
tennis is one of the main causes 
of tennis elbow, but many other 
activities that involve repetitive 
actions of the hand or wrist, like 
using a screwdriver, hammering, 
painting, raking, and weaving, can 
also lead to the injury.
Tennis elbow mainly affects the 
outer surface of the elbow bone. 
It is caused due to overuse of the 
forearm muscle. Researchers 
believe that two most common 
causes of the condition are lat
eral epicondylitis and radial tunnel 
syndrome.
, Lateral epicondylitis is caused 
due to repeated contractions of 
the forearm muscle. The forearm 
muscle is in action when the arm 
is raised or straightened. The main 
areas affected in the injury are the 
muscle and tendon areas, which 
are attached to the outside bony 
formation of the elbow.
Doctors suggest that lateral
epicondylitis may be a degenera
tive process as a result of aging 
or repetitive swinging of the arm. 
Constant rubbing of the bone 
against the muscle causes abra
sion of the tissues. This creates 
an area that has a smaller chance 
of healing because it has insuffi
cient access to nutrients and oxy
gen due to inadequate blood flow. 
Consequently, there is a degenera
tion of the tendon demonstrated 
by small tears and inflammation.
The second reason behind ten
nis elbow, radial tunnel syndrome, 
is the compression of a nerve fiber 
within the forearm. This is the 
main nerve involved in operating 
several muscles around the hand 
and wrist.
Regardless of how the patient 
acquires tennis elbow, the first 
few weeks are almost disabling. In 
the beginning, when the injury is 
fresh, patients experience sudden 
pain that radiates from the outside 
of the elbow into the forearm and 
wrist. The pain worsens when the 
person squeezes something in his 
or her hand or turns a doorknob. 
If the wrist is moved with force, 
or is strained by any attempt of 
stabilizing it by force, the pain can 
become almost unbearable.
It takes just a few weeks for the 
pain to get worse, to such an extent 
that it may hurt even when a per
sons arm is still.
Men and women are equally 
likely to suffer from tennis elbow. 
Tennis elbow usually affects the 
dominant arm of an individual. 
For example, a right-handed per
son will more likely be injured in 
the right hand, though in around 
25 percent of the cases, it may 
affect the non-dominant arm.
Tennis elbow is commonly seen 
in two groups of people  manual 
laborers and sports participants, 
especially racket sport players.
Interestingly, 95 percent of the 
reported cases are of non-players.
Maha Mahmoud, a junior in the 
Tepper School of Business, shared 
her experience with tennis elbow 
as a teen.
I suffered from tennis elbow 
after I served assuming an incor
rect posture, Mahmoud said. It 
took an entire month of regular 
physiotherapy, and absolutely no 
tennis, for me to recover.
For tennis players, it is best to 
have a professional review their 
playing technique in order to pre
vent tennis elbow. Players should 
have the whole body involved in 
the stroke by swinging the racket 
with the whole arm and not just 
the part of the arm from the wrist 
to the elbow.
It is important to build strength 
and keep the wrist straight during
any lifting activity. Ice compres
sions after heavy use can prevent 
tennis elbow. After all, prevention 
is better than cure.
Having said that, the PRICE 
study (which stands for the key 
concepts protection, rest, ice, 
compression, and elevation) con
ducted by a group of researchers 
in Belfast, Northern Ireland, U.K. 
promotes these notions as curing 
agents of tennis elbow.
The study suggests that an 
injured person should protect the 
arm by not using it very often, giv
ing it rest, giving it an ice massage, 
compressing it with an elastic wrap 
or bandage, and holding the elbow 
above heart level to limit swelling.
Once the acute inflammatory 
phase passes, physiotherapy to 
strengthen and to increase flex
ibility of the arm is recommended. 
Surgery is very rare but it may be 
the only alternative in some cases. 
The inflamed tendon is trimmed, 
or it may be surgically released 
and then attached again to fix the 
damage.
Tennis elbow is not that difficult 
to acquire. It can affect virtually 
anyone who uses his or her domi
nant arm very frequently. The best 
defense is to know about it, take 
the necessary precautions, and 
play safe.

Findings: Remembering Indricothere
SHEILA PRAKASH

Sixty-five million years ago, 
an asteroid slammed into the 
Yucatan Peninsula, decimating 
the planet and wiping out all of 
the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous 
period. But that is not the end 
of story. There were survivors of 
this catastrophe, and over tens 
of millions of years, they went to 
form one of the most impressive 
and spectacular displays of wild
life the Earth has ever known.
Fast-forward 10 million years: 
The dinosaurs are gone. In their 
wake, a new order of creatures is 
growing, multiplying, and adapt
ing into every niche of the ecosys
tem. At this stage  25 million 
years before the appearance of 
man  Earth is in full blossom, 
providing a fresh and rejuvenat
ed habitat for a gallimaufry of 
creatures you have never heard 
of. These animals are big, loud, 
and unlike anything you have 
ever seen.
Tyrannosaurus rex is a distant 
memory in this world. Here, 
mammals and birds of whoppingf and unfathomable sizes 
rule the land. Gastomis, a flight
less, flesh-eating bird the size 
of a grown man, tears its prey 
to shreds with one thrash of its 
colossal beak.
Basilosaurus, an oceandwelling lizard half the size of 
a Boeing 737, waits for a shark 
and then swallows it whole. 
Andrewsarchus, the largest mam
malian carnivore in the world, is 
six feet tall and has a head the 
size of an alligator.
The six-part BBC television 
documentary Walking with Beasts 
(aired in North America on the 
Discovery Channel under the title 
Walking with Prehistoric Beasts) 
does an exemplary job bringing 
to life Gastornis, Basilosaurus, 
Andrewsarchus, and other relics 
of this prehistoric era.
Like the dinosaurs before 
them, the distribution of prehis
toric beasts was widespread. But 
for mammalian giants, Central 
Asia was a particular hotbed.
Mongolia: The time is the 
Oligocene, a period in Earths 
history from 33.9 million to 
23 million BCE. The Oligocene 
comes at the heels of a trying 
period in Earths history, when 
the ecosystem is erratic and 
climate change is tumultuous. 
During this time, one in every 
five species went extinct. But the 
Oligocene marks the beginning 
of a vigorous resurgence.
Now, the Earth is fresh, florid, 
and ready to house the next gen
eration of inhabitants. Some of 
the beasts of the Oligocene have 
grown to enormous sizes  sizes 
that greatly exceed those of mod
ern-day animals.
The Chalicothere, a bizarrelooking creature with the gate of 
a horse and the face of a sloth, 
was nine feet tall, and walked on 
its knuckles. Entelodonts, fero
cious hunters and ancestors of 
todays pig, were seven feet tall,
and as bulky as the Rhinoceros. 
But nowhere is this abundance 
of giants more apparent than in 
Mongolia.
It is nightfall in the Mongolian 
desert, and there is a disturbance 
in the leaves. The rustling grows 
louder until, slowly, the outline of 
an animal the size of three dou
ble-decker buses emerges from 
the foliage. It is an Indricothere, 
the largest land mammal that 
ever lived, and it is hungry.
Out of all the bizarre animals 
that emerged after the decima
tion of the dinosaurs, none left a 
footprint as large and unforget
table as the Indricothere.
Woolly mammoths and sabertoothed tigers are arguably the 
most tossed-about relics from the 
age of prehistoric beasts. But the 
Indricothere dwarfed a woolly 
mammoth by several magni
tudes.
Measuring 40 feet tall and 
weighing 12 tons, a full-grown 
Indricothere could have com
peted in size with any dinosaur 
of its day.
These precursors to the mod
ern-day rhinoceros were so 
enormous that they were able 
to lead a life free of predation 
simply by intimidating any ani
mal that crossed their path. Even 
Entelodonts were no match for 
the Indricothere, Whose rawhide 
skin and thunderous stomp were 
enough to send the hungriest 
carnivores scampering for the 
hills.
Despite their tremendous
size, molar remnants of the 
Indricothere suggest that it was 
an herbivore. Like many large her
bivores today, the Indricotheres 
roamed the Oligocene landscape 
in packs.
Indricotheres were found as 
far west as Eastern Europe, but 
are most widely discovered in the 
middle of Central Asia.
Mike Fortelius is a professor 
of ecological paleontology at 
the University of Helsinki and 
an expert on the Indricothere. 
He provides insightful audio 
commentary on the Discovery 
Channels website that expounds 
on these facts.
Fortelius points out that large 
animals are better able to cope 
with bad spells (such as long 
dry seasons) and other hard
ships. These conditions are often 
encountered in the middle of a 
large continent. The rise of the 
Indricothere is concurrent with 
the mounting dry spells that rav
aged Asia during this period in 
geological history.
The Indricothere is 
a member of order 
Perissodactyla  
hoofed animals 
with an odd num
ber of toes. A 
modern exam
ple of an odd
toed ungulate 
is the Brazilian 
tapir. Visually, 
llamas (South 
American 
pack animals) provide a good represen
tation of a grossly downscaled 
Indricothere  minus the fur. 
Still, like many relics of this for
gotten world, Indricothrium 
transoiiralicum lacks a common 
name.
There is a skeleton of 
Indricothrium transouralicum in 
the National Science Museum in 
Tokyo. In Reutlingen, Germany, 
a short-lived exhibit on dinosaurs 
included a massive monument to 
the Indricothere.
However, the best way to 
get your hands on Indricothere 
is to view BBCs Walking with 
Prehistoric Beasts. (This DVD
is available at the Carnegie 
Museum of Natural History.)
The dinosaurs lived, and the 
dinosaurs died. For many, the 
story ends there. But for 25 mil
lion years, another group of 
animals came to dominate the 
Earth.
These were not the dinosaurs, 
but were ferocious and unwieldy 
mammals. Mammals that would 
eventually evolve into some 
of the most highly developed 
organisms on Earth. In an era of 
mammals that culminates with 
modern man, the Indricothere 
was our finest hour.

Students lugging iPods and cell phones 
around campus may soon be a thing of 
the past. In the near future, some clothes 
will be equipped to play music and receive 
calls.
This futuristic concept of computerized 
clothing, also known as smart clothing, 
is rapidly becoming the next new phe
nomenon in fashion, with manufacturers 
scrambling to emulate the newest in dimate-controlled clothing and trendy com
puterized accessories.
Among the smart clothes becoming com
monplace today is climate-controlled cloth-x 
ing, which can adapt itself to surrounding 
weather conditions. Current commercial 
applications of climate-controlled clothing 
operate using fibers designed to stretch 
or curl in a certain direction when heat
ed. Manufacturers can create fabric that 
adapts itself to weather conditions by 
overlaying clothing with many tiny strips 
of these fibers; the clothing can become 
cooler in warm weather and warmer in 
cold weather.
When the fabric is heated up, the strips 
curl outward, increasing airflow through
out the clothing. Conversely, when the 
fabric is cooled, the strips straighten out 
and form a solid layer, preventing loss 
of heat and moisture. These fabrics have 
proven invaluable for activities that involve 
changing temperatures, including moun
tain climbing and skiing.
Similar fibers have also been harnessed 
for more interesting uses. By coloring the 
sides of the fibers differently, manufac
turers can use the curling of the fibers to 
reveal a different color. This has led to the 
creation of color-changing clothing, Which 
can change color depending on the tem
perature of the surroundings, or even its 
wearers mood.
The latest innovations in smart clothing, 
however, remain a guarded secret, perhaps 
for military applications or competitive 
sports. One successful implementation of 
smart fabrics has been put into practice 
by Canterbury of New Zealand, the manu
facturer of the famous All Blacks rugby 
team uniforms. Canterburys outfits cre
ate a negatively charged electromagnetic 
field that can speed up both the delivery of
oxygen to the muscles through the blood
stream and removal of wastes such as 
lactic acid. According to testing done by. 
Loughborough University in the U.K., these 
outfits can improve output power and 
increase recovery by up to 2.7 percent.
Despite the many advancements in fabric 
design, embedded electronics in clothing 
have yet to be commercially implemented, 
as issues such as freedom of movement and 
cleaning remain difficult to solve for fragile 
electronic systems.
One fabric under investigation at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
called silk organza, has been utilized 
in India for decades, but its electronic 
uses are only now becoming apparent. 
Silk organza is woven with silk thread 
against copper-wrapped thread, which 
gives it excellent conducting properties. 
When interwoven with strips of insulating 
material to avoid the copper threads touch
ing, the threads can act as long parallel 
wires running along the fabric, almost like 
a computer ribbon cable.
Materials such as silk organza lend them
selves to many interesting applications, 
such as connecting sensors for various
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
bodily reactions such as body temperature 
and heart rate, in addition to processing 
units that can display this useful informa
tion pertaining to the wearer.
A different application of interwoven 
fibers uses optical fibers rather than cop
per thread, and is being tested in military 
clothing today. Beams of light run across 
the body through these fibers, and when 
the fibers are broken, the system is able 
to pinpoint the location of puncture in the 
material. This can be used to determine the 
exact point of gunshot wounds in order to 
expedite treatment.
The forerunners in consumer electronic 
clothing come in the form of electronics 
embedded in running shoes, which are 
already being used to monitor running 
speeds and distance in athletics. Among 
other more esoteric creations, Levis has 
already created jeans with a built-in iPod 
docking station, and Spytek has developed 
shirts with hidden cameras inside.
The future of smart clothes is limited, 
though, unless manufacturers can find a 
way to make them washable  nobody 
wants to wear the same shirt for weeks 
on end.

doctorate in computer science.
The website prompts users 
to answer 10 questions based 
on their stances on American 
political issues.
Once the users answer all
10 questions and submit their 
responses, they are directed 
to a page which displays the 
name of the presidential candi
date whose ideas most closely 
resemble their own.
The website, which was start
ed in January, was visited by 
over 1.5 million people as of 
March 17, according to Lee.
A lot of people were trying 
[to access the website] on Super 
Tuesday, which took place on 
Feb. 5. 200,000 people visited 
the website in one day, Lee 
said.
Similar to online quizzes that 
suggest which Hollywood celeb
rity your personality is most akin 
to or what career you are most 
likely to choose, Lees quiz sug
gests which candidates voters 
are most likely to vote for in 
terms of their political beliefs.
The website also offers 
detailed explanations about acts 
that some people may be gen
erally unfamiliar with, such as 
the No Child Left Behind Act of 
2001, a federal law that asserts 
several reforms in the American 
education system.
At the end of the quiz, users 
are shown a summary of which 
presidential candidates they 
most agree with. In addition, 
users can click on the details 
link and view how and why their 
opinions differ or agree with the 
respective candidates.
According to Lee, this is the 
most unique aspect of Vote 
Chooser because users under
stand how exactly they agreed 
or disagreed.
Lee said that he created the 
website using HTML, the widely 
used mark-up language used 
for web pages, and the Practical 
Extraction and Report Language 
(Perl) script, a procedural pro
gramming language that is used 
in interactive web programs.
For example, one question 
on the website prompts users to 
pick whether they believe that 
invading Iraq was a mistake. The 
words yes and no appear as 
choice tabs and users must click 
on one of them.
If users click on yes, their 
views in terms of the invasion 
of Iraq are in line with Obama 
and Paul. The website displays 
quotes from Obamas and Pauls 
public statements that imply 
these results.
According to a Carnegie 
Mellon press release, Lee intends 
to keep the site operational 
through the rest of the prima
ries and during the general elec
tion in November, even though 
the number of actual candidates 
might vary.
Vote Chooser is also a use
ful-tool for non-citizens who are 
new to American politics and 
are curious to know which can
didate they are most likely to 
agree with.
An exchange student from 
Imperial College London, Deepti 
Sewraz said, The quiz is very 
user-friendly and most impor
tantly targets, in my opinion, key 
issues and goals of the different 
presidential candidates.
Sewraz, a junior in the chemi
cal engineering program, also 
said that she discovered that her 
political views are most similar 
to Obamas.
Dana Hadan, a junior business 
administration major, said that 
Vote Chooser provided her with 
an ideal summary of the differ
ences between the views of can
didates in both the Republican 
and Democratic parties.
While Vote Chooser shows 
voters which candidates they 
are most compatible with, it is 
not associated with any politi
cal party or candidate. Its inten
tion is to help voters make more 
informed decisions about which 
candidate to vote for during the 
presidential elections.
Scientists say 
driving deserves 
full attention
DRIVING, fromA6
More significantly, Just said 
that most of the subjects. who 
had experience talking on cell 
phones while driving on a reg
ular basis still committed th 
same errors on the virtual road; ' 
Therefore, it seems that even 
drivers that are used to talking 
on cell phones still suffer in 
their driving abilities.
Of course, novice drivers ar 
likely to have a harder time. 
People who havent had expe
rience [in talking and driving at 
the same time] would be worse 
off, Just said.
A common belief among drivers is that talking on cell phones 
is not dangerous because they 
pay more attention to the road 
than they do to the conver, sation. Another experiment by 
Just and his colleagues helped 
disprove this idea.
In this experiment, subjects 
were once again placed in the 
dual-task situation of driv
ing and conversing on the cell 
phone, using a computer simu
lation. However, in one case of 
the experiment they were asked 
to completely ignore the lan^ 
guage being spoken and focus 
entirely on the spatial task. Th 
results showed that even then, 
the brain was not able to disen
gage attention from what was 
being spoken.
When you try to ignore a ! 
language you understand you 
will be completely unsuccessful 
in trying to ignore it; it com: 
pletely gets in. It gets processed 
almost identically to when you 
are fully attending to it, Just  
said.
The bottom line is that 
although some states have reg
ulations against holding a cell 
phone and talking while driv
ing, multitasking while driving 
is a danger to drivers and oth- > 
ers on the road.

synthetic techniques that will 
become bound to the particle 
surface, Bockstaller said.
The significance of the proj
ect to the students lies in the 
various potential applications of 
their discovery.
Dong agreed. I like things 
that have applications that are 
close to real life, she said. Im 
. happy this stuff has a real appli
cation and will have an impact 
in academia and an impact in 
industry.
Dong was responsible for syn-. 
thesizing the particles, while 
Listak worked on the charac
terization of the particles via an 
electron microscope, according 
to Bockstaller.
Bockstaller has his own ideas 
about how the groups research 
will affect the development of 
new materials, which he says is 
a multi-billion dollar industry.
Rather than use this for new 
applications, I would rather see 
this as a big step in enhancing 
existing applications, he said.
The particles could be used in 
product packaging where trans
parency is important to consum
ers, Bockstaller said.
Additionally, they could aid in 
the development of transparent 
suntan lotion.
Sunscreen contains nanopar
ticles that are responsible for UV 
protection and give the lotion its 
white color.
The particles could also be 
added to windshields to make 
them absorb more light  
something that is not currently 
possible because nanoparticles 
that scatter light would block 
the drivers view.
The Airforce has also 
expressed interest in this tech
nology, so eventually we might 
be thinking about applications in 
this direction, said Bockstaller.
But the results of the research 
are more than purely scientific.
This is a textbook case on 
how research on new discover
ies is being made, Bockstaller 
said.
This is proof that the discov
ery of an invention comes from 
the work of a student on a prob
lem because of his or her persis
tence, discipline, and curiosity, 
he added. Students could learn 
from this story.

Drive a composite vehicle 
save the world?FromTheEditorialBoard
and composite technology into a fuelefficient, safe car that could have prac
tical, daily use. Its definitely small, de
signed to hold only two passengers (but 
with ample storage space in the rear).
But the fact that this highly designed, 
highly publicized car is so small and 
lightweight is incredibly important to 
the future of personal travel vehicles.
Smaller cars, in being lightweight, 
use less gas and thus reduce carbon 
emissions. Several small, energy-effi
cient vehicles such as the Mitsubishi 
iMiEV and the Toyota IQ Car are gain
ing popularity among the general pub
lic. While their popularity is limited due 
to the overwhelming size of SUVs that 
dominate our nations roadways, mak
ing lightweight cars smaller and poten
tially dangerous by comparison, if more 
people lean towards purchasing smaller 
cars, SUVs will retain less dominance.
This is where the Aptera shines. This 
mega-solid composite vehicle, which 
can get over 300 miles per gallon, is go
ing to be available to Californians later 
this year, and for less than $30,000/In 
fact, you can even reserve your own at 
www.aptera.com. It is really laudable 
that such a high-performing system is 
finally going to breach the boundary Be
tween the conceptual world of automo
tive engineering and the physical world 
of the public market. With the Aptera, 
were getting somewhere  and though 
I may have to move to California to get 
one, maybe it will act as my second

I want to save the world.
I want to be a sort of opinion-writing, 
pink-moccasins-wearing, buggy-driving 
rock star who travels around the world 
and designs uber-green and self-sustain
ing cities. To do all that, Im going to need 
a getaway car thats as manageable and 
efficient as the work Im trying to create.
And so, I really want an Aptera.
Created by Steve Fambro and Chris 
Anthony, the Aptera is a car that is super 
light, super environmentally friendly, 
and super awesome-looking.
Imagine a sleek, rounded, beam-like 
shape that rests on two front wheels 
and one rear wheel, all three of which 
are covered by smooth fairings that con
tinue the shape of the vehicle. At first 
only available in California, the Aptera 
is classified by that state as a motorcycle 
(although you dont need a motorcycle 
license to drive it). It has three large 
windows for increased visibility, two of 
which are mounted within its wicked 
Delorean-esque gull-wing doors. Its 
Back to the Future meets Buggy.
I wont lie. The Aptera is to me, an 
over-the-top Buggy aficionado, kind of 
like a grown-up version of my own tiny 
composite vehicle (composites being

once bonded, have a high strength-toweight ratio), one that could take me

However, smoking has risen to the top

Yet smoking should not eclipse the

by sleep. However, the campus commu

Pennsylvania is a key player in primaries
As an advocate for all things gossip, I 
was offended by Amanda Coles March
3 article Britney Spears isnt real news
 not because I think that Spears 
lapses and recoveries should be splat
tered across the front page of the news, 
but because the article was an attack 
on popular culture and on our societys 
habits of news consumption.
People should expectto see real news, 
not pop culture news, Cole writes. This 
statement implies that popular culture 
isnt real news or worthy of printing. 
Writing that article was a testament to 
the realness of popular culture as news, 
as Cole felt the need to respond to the 
fact that Spears is making headlines. If 
popular culture wasnt important, why 
would Cole write a whole article defam
ing it in a campus newspaper? And who 
is Cole to say that Angelina Jolie  a pop 
culture icon, by the way  is worthy of 
real news because of her charitable ef
forts? A celebritys work is only impor
tant and worth reporting on if it relates 
to another important issue, Cole says. 
Are divorce, alcoholism, and mental in
stability not important issues? Maybe 
people want to read about Spears and 
Lindsay Lohans life fumbles because 
it humanizes these celebrities. Their 
mistakes make them more like us, and 
so we dont feel so bad about our lives 
when we know that other people are go
ing through the same things.
Not everyone can afford to adopt 
bunches of babies from different coun
tries and give out lots of money; Jolie 
gets paid $10 million for a movie, and I 
get paid $9 an hour for a graveyard shift 
at the Morewood desk. And has Cole 
forgotten the days of Jolie being splat
tered across gossip magazines with Jen
nifer Aniston? Was she so newsworthy 
when magazine covers claimed that she 
unjustly stole Brad Pitt from Aniston?
We are popular culture. Anti-popular 
culture movements are a part of popular 
culture. Coles article is now ingrained 
forever on the Internet  which is a 
means of exposing popular culture. If 
people want to know what happened 
when Lohan went to Les Deux last night, 
relapsing on the promises she made in 
Alcoholics Anonymous mere hours be
fore, so be it. If someone wants a side 
of the latest Spears news with their 
daily presidential race update, so be it. 
Should popular culture be on the front 
cover of The New York Times? No. But 
is that news important? Yes; because 
popular culture is important, and de
nying the significance or seriousness of 
popular culture is shameful. Centuries 
from now, people will study the popular 
culture of our time and its significance 
on the generations that followed. So 
does Cole mean to demean something 
that is and will be so integral to so many 
lives?
Just because an article isnt about 
politics or war or international tragedy 
doesnt mean its not serious. Ive written 
plenty of Forum articles criticizing pop
ular culture and bizarre examples that 
pop icons set for society  and I mean 
the things I say. I take popular culture se
riously and I want Cole to as well. Maybe 
she didnt mean to harshly criticize the 
effects of popular culture on what she 
refers to as real news sources, but she 
did. And as Pillbox Editor, she must real
ize that some articles in her own section 
of the paperlike those on fashion and 
music  are serious and thoughtful re
flections of popular culture. And some
times, theyre featured on the cover 
page. Popular culture isnt something to 
be shuffled into a back corner.

sent out voter registration information

Democrats have also helped with regis
tration throughout the year.
The numbers are telling. In the week 
of March 10, 1453 already-registered 
voters changed their party to Demo
cratic in Allegheny County; 22,152 peo
ple changed their party to Democratic in 
Pennsylvania. In a state where you have 
to be registered as a Democrat, the party 
switch is important and telling. People 
are helping make a huge difference in 
our countrys politics, and for the first 
time in a long time Pennsylvania is go
ing to matter. Kudos to those encourag
ing change, and most especially to the 
Students for Obama group.
Theres also that other demographic, 
the young, who should rock this vote. 
The impact that college students should, 
and want to have, is manifest in Carn
egie Mellon Students for Barack Obama 
group. With no school funding and no 
official club status (which means they 
cant table in the UC), their capabili
ties should be limited  and yet, they

for. Students for Obama even helped 
get Carnegie Mellon graduate Zach
ary Quinto from Heroes to campus to 
encourage students to register to vote. 
Their tenacity is wonderful, and for that 
The Tartan applauds them.
Students for Obama isnt the only 
group making an impact on voter regPennsylvania has never mattered so 
much before. On April 22, Pennsylvania 
residents are going to be largely respon
sible for the outcome of the Democratic 
party nomination. Today will dictate the 
potential power Pennsylvania actually 
has in this primary, though, because to
day is the voter registration deadline.
This years presidential primary has 
been muddled with states trying to 
move up their deadlines, which has cost 
a huge voting party, that of Florida and 
Michigan, a huge price. In the 2004 elec
tion, the largest group of voters were se
nior citizens, with 79 percent of those 
eligible registering to vote. But Florida, 
the state with the largest population of 
senior citizens, has been auf-ed, and 
that leaves the state with the number 
two largest senior citizen population to 
make that impact: Pennsylvania.
Journalists should not have to disclose sources

mer army scientist Steven J. Hatfill, who 
was a Justice Dept, person of interest in 
the anthrax attacks. For not explaining 
where she got her information, Locy 
bears the weight of all reporters that 
divulge sensitive material to the public
 that of being trapped between doing 
a service to their readership and playing 
by the rules of political correctness.
Good journalism communicates reallife issues to the people. As an in-thetrenches reporter, Locy got the word out 
on an important issue, and for that we 
commend her. Yet tackling security is
sues should not become a ruinous career 
decision. The media needs to be able to 
report on issues based on government 
policy without being persecuted, or else
they could become no more than a pro
paganda machine. If a journalist must 
withhold a sources information to be 
able to acquire the most knowledge on 
the subject from that source, then she or 
he should be respected for doing her or 
his work in a professional manner, not 
singled out and humiliated.
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist 
Reg Henry echoed these thoughts at an 
opinion writers panel last Wednesday in 
the Adamson Wing, reminding us that 
journalism is a difficult and respect
able trade. In reporting on the anthrax 
attacks and not divulging her sources, 
Locy took a stand and defiantly stood up 
for the freedom of the press. She should 
not be bankrupted for communicating 
the word to the people.
In a March 8 article in The New York 
Times, the Associated Press exposed an 
important controversy in journalism: 
the issue of what to do when journalists 
withhold sources on a sensitive topic, 
particularly those of national security. 
The article details a recent issue in which 
a former USA Today reporter, Toni Locy, 
is being fined for refusing to disclose her 
sources for several stories on the 2001 
anthrax scare. In light of this, we ask, is 
there still freedom of the press in this age 
of terrorism and biological warfare?
U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton 
ruled that Locy must pay fines of up to 
$5000 a day from early March until her 
April 3 appearance before the judge.

Establishing green practices in Qatar
ANDREW PETERS
Sixty years ago, while 
Pittsburgh was enjoying its peak, 
Doha was a sleepy fishing town of 
a few thousand. Today, the city is 
larger than Pittsburgh by nearly 
100,000 inhabitants, not to men
tion itinerant workers, and shows 
little sign of stopping. Like nearby 
Dubai, Doha, the capital of Qatar, 
exploded in the second half of the 
20th century after the discovery 
of oil and natural gas resources in 
the late 1940s, and it continues to 
develop at a rapid pace.
Throughout the city, old build
ings are demolished and new 
ones put up in the course of only 
several months. Development 
projects that might take a decade 
in the U.S. are complete in less 
than two years in Doha. One 
Carnegie Mellon Qatar staffer 
whom I spoke with on a spring 
break trip to Doha remarked only 
half-jokingly that he saw land lev
eled and a building go up, get 
tom down, and be replaced by a 
new building within the course 
of a year. This is growth at such a 
pace that Americans, except per
haps those in some parts of the 
Southwest, would have trouble 
comprehending.
Still, all of this growth is 
occurring in a country firmly 
entrenched in a set of practices 
and planning decisions that are 
environmentally destructive. The 
most apparent problem is Qatars 
lack of recycling practices, which 
will likely be easier to tackle than 
some of the citys design prob
lems. On a city planning level, 
Doha often takes on the feel of a 
contemporary American suburb; 
its difficult (and often either pro
hibitively dangerous or hot) to 
get anywhere on foot, and in the 
absence of effective mass transit, 
most get around by driving from 
place to place in energy-ineffi
cient SUVs or vans. Lastly, dredg
ing for land reclamation projects 
continues to tax the marine eco
system, and the city often uses its 
limited water resources for irriga
tion of decorative landscaping.
In speaking with my comrades 
at the Neville Co-op about these 
problems, one of them hit upon 
an interesting point. How can 
you conceive of a green lifestyle 
in the desert, where nothing is 
green? The question is not super
ficial: Without evidence of either 
polluted or resuscitated rivers, 
deforestation or reforestation, or 
years of research on the effects of 
pollution in diverse ecosystems, 
how do you sell the idea of green 
practices in this region?
On top of this problem, it
remains the fact both here in the 
U.S. and in Qatar that economic 
incentives for business and gov
ernments to adopt green practic
es are not always readily appar
ent. The problem is even worse in 
Qatar, where the small number 
of residents can consistently rely 
on huge natural gas revenues, so 
that even if the externalities of 
growth pose risks to the environ
ment, they are not likely to be 
prohibitively expensive.
To further exacerbate my 
friends point, though Qatar is 
arguably one of the most open 
and progressive nations in the 
Gulf, it is not a democracy and the 
ability of residents to put pressure 
on the government and create 
change in environmental prac
tices is severely limited. Because 
there is not democratic represen
tation and the residents of Qatar 
are not subject to taxation from 
the government, it would be dif
ficult to muster enough political 
leverage to create change.
This is exactly the set of prob
lems that student organizations 
. in Doha are currently facing. The 
Carnegie Mellon Qatar campus, 
for example, is home to Livegreen, 
a student group working to pro
mote and raise consciousness 
of green practices despite these 
seemingly insurmountable hur
dles. Its members believe, and I 
agree, that despite massive dif
ficulties, there is potential for 
Qatar to accept green practices.
While visiting Doha, I frequent
ly heard that green practices will 
be hard to implement because 
they are not a part of the estab
lished culture. This notion, how
ever, is inconsistent with some 
current Qatari practices. For 
example, many toilets in Qatar 
come not with a single handle, 
but with two buttons, one for a 
light flush and one for a heavy 
flush, in an effort to conserve 
expensive desalinized water. 
Moreover, every electrical outlet, 
including individual outlets on 
power strips and outlets for dish
washers, refrigerators, and air 
conditioners, has its own switch, 
which allows consumers to con
trol and monitor their electricity 
use more effectively. Thus, it is 
clear that Qatar has a widespread 
Understanding of conservation, 
which is a central idea in any sys
tem of green practices.
Moreover, saying that green 
practices are inconsistent with 
the values of Qataris ignores the 
tenet of sustainability, which 
is the foundation of the green 
movement. Indeed, the goals of 
green practices and the goals of 
Qatars leaders in developing that 
nations infrastructure and indus
tries are largely consistent. Qatar 
is investing its natural gas rev
enue in education, science, and
technology for a reason: The 
emir, Sheik Hamad, knows that 
while his countrys natural gas 
resources may last for a while  
50, 100, 200 years  they will 
not last forever. At some point, 
Qatar will be left to sustain itself 
with only sand and ocean, at 
which point it had better have a, 
diversified economy and some 
unique goods and services.
In a mind-boggling twist, 
Sheik Hamads government is 
spending its gas money on devel
oping education and science at 
a rapid pace in order to end the 
countrys future dependence on 
non-renewable resources like 
natural gas and ensure a diverse 
economy in the future. Though 
it would be too much of a stretch 
to call this a green practice 
outright/it still suggests that 
Qataris are concerned, at the 
very least, with sustainability in 
the economic sense. Grassroots 
student groups like Livegreen 
understand that concern for the 
future economy and stability of 
the country must be tied to cur
rent environmental practices, 
and as such, have taken on the 
difficult task of working with 
Qatars younger generations to 
raise awareness of this vision.

Culture triumphs politics: An American in Pyongyang
CYNTHIA PENG
For one night on Feb. 26, in a 
barren, stoic land half a world 
away from us, art triumphed over 
hostility. Political animosity and 
past antagonisms were tempo
rarily put aside as the New York 
Philharmonic performed in the 
East Pyongyang Theater in North 
Korea, marking a historic night 
of music and culture. The trip 
was prominent not only because 
it marked the largest group of 
, foreigners to enter North Korea 
in 50 years, but also because it 
showed how, despite existing bit
ter political dissidence in United 
States-North Korea relations, 
music can serve as a common 
ground to unite both nations citi
zens and culture.
The Philharmonic chose its pro
gram with great care. With the 
American and North Korean flags 
flanking both ends of the stage, 
music director Lorin Maazel 
began the concert with both the 
U.S. and North Korean national 
anthems. Maazel then launched 
the Philharmonic into the Prelude 
to Act III from Wagners opera 
Lohegrin. Following the spirited 
Wagner, the symbolically cho
sen Symphony No. 9 by Antonin 
Dvorak was performed nobly and 
heroically. Commonly known as 
the New World Symphony, this 
was the very symphony that 
Dvorak wrote in wonderment 
as he began his life in America, 
a new world, and is thus fit
ting for a concert in another new, 
unfamiliar world.
Following these pieces came 
George Gershwins An American 
in Paris, continuing the new 
world theme by illustrating the 
delight and frivolousness of the 
Parisian atmosphere as expe
rienced by a foreigner. While 
introducing the piece, Maazel 
remarked to the audience that per
haps one day, someone will write 
a piece entitled An American in 
Pyongyang, a comment received 
warmly by the appreciative audi
ence of 1400 foreign journalists 
and North Korean elites.
The warmest reception, howev
er, came at the end of the program, 
when the Philharmonic played 
Arirang, a beloved Korean folk 
song respected on both sides of 
the border. Understanding the 
song to be a symbol for the reuni
fication of North and South, audi
ence members largely agreed that 
the atmosphere became emotion
ally charged, especially for the
11 members of the orchestra of 
Korean origin.
The concert, the last stop on the 
Philharmonics tour of Asia, marks 
a new era in the age of ping-pong 
diplomacy, a term aptly coined 
in the 1970s when an American 
ping-pong team traveled to 
Maoist China, effectively leading 
to the opening up of the country. 
In addition to such athletic diplo
macy, past music groups have 
also visited closed-off countries; 
the Boston Symphony Orchestra 
and the Philadelphia Orchestra 
journeyed to the former Soviet 
Union and Peoples Republic of 
China, respectively, during the 
Cold War era.
The diplomacy effort on the 
part of the Philharmonic in trav
eling to North Korea was inter
preted as a note of optimism on 
the part of the Philharmonics 
directors and musicians, as well as 
U.S. officials, toward U.S.-North 
Korea relations. Maazel stated 
in an interview that he [didnt] 
want to be overly conscious ... 
but just wanted the people in the 
audience and through television 
to see us as friendly people who 
love their work and who wish to 
communicate what we feel about
wyM*#'?
music to the people.
Politically, some hope that the 
concert will serve as a means to 
open North Koreas doors to the 
Western world and lead to an 
eventual agreement by the coun
try to dismantle its weapons of 
mass destruction. For example, 
former Defense Secretary William 
Perry, who was in attendance, 
called the event a milestone, 
according to Newsweek.
Washington officials did not 
feel the same way. The Bush 
administration did not comment 
on the performance and has 
distanced itself from the event. 
Interestingly, Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice, an accom
plished pianist, was in South 
Korea for the inauguration of
the South Korean president and 
could have attended the concert. 
Instead, she countered the opti
mism of the event. I dont think 
we should get carried away with 
what listening to Dvorak is going 
to do in North Korea, she said, 
according to Time.
While Rice is correct that it 
is' evident that a concert will 
not single-handedly sway North 
Koreas dismantlement, what it 
has in fact accomplished is the 
warming of U.S.-North Korea 
relations through the commonal
ity of music and culture.
Zarin Mehta, the executive 
director of the New York 
Philharmonic, echoed this sen
timent in a telecast interview: 
There is a chance that this will
Allison Piper/Assistant Photo Editor
start to open up peoples minds 
... then we will have done some 
good in the world. Thats the 
only thing we can hope for. 
That is precisely the role 
of cultural diplomacy. The 
Philharmonics musical gesture 
allowed for both Americans 
and North Koreans to see each 
other as human beings rather 
than political enemies. Art is 
a uniting force, and all we can 
hope for is that perhaps one 
day the political relations will 
mirror those of the New York 
Philharmonics concert  not of 
discord, but harmony.

Perspectives
Campus Rec 
Program and 
student elections
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hey Tartans,
Welcome back to sunny Pitts
burgh! I hope all of your spring 
break experiences turned out 
well, and that you brought back 
some rays of sunshine with you 
along with some stories that will 
last you a lifetime.
Adi and I got right down to 
business last week, finishing up 
the final details in bringing back 
the Campus Rec Program. Last 
year, the program enabled stu
dents to enjoy free, 1950s-style 
bicycles and other miscella
neous athletic equipment. Most 
of the gear that was available 
ended up finding its way into a 
rather decrepit state  that is, 
if it wasnt outright stolen from 
the unguarded areas in which it 
was housed. For this years itera
tion of the program, we reached 
out to Student Dormitory Coun
cil (SDC), which will now act as 
a responsible guardian for the 
equipment. This joint venture 
should alleviate the deteriora
tion experienced in the past, and 
we are definitely excited to see 
the results. Under the program, 
students will be able to use foot
balls, soccer balls, and frisbees 
by checking them out at different 
residence halls across campus. 
Special thanks to SDC President 
Byron Chou and Vice President 
Mike Albrecht for helping make 
this vision a reality.
Weve also taken the initiative 
to get involved in our countrys 
great political process by inviting 
all the major party candidates still 
standing to rally on our campus. 
Some inroads have already been 
made via personal connections, 
and we ask that if anyone out 
there has ties with (in alphabeti
cal order) Hillary Clinton, John 
McCain, or Barack Obama to let 
us know so we can help in bring
ing them to our school. This isnt 
to say that were opposed to any 
minor party candidates speaking 
on campus, and if you have con
nections with Ralph Nader or Mi
chael Bloomberg, let us know too 
well be glad to assist in getting 
them to Carnegie Mellon.
Finally, Adi and I would like to 
spread the word on the upcoming 
student body president, vice pres
ident, vice president for finance, 
and undergraduate Student Sen
ate elections. Petitions to run can 
be found at the UC Information 
Desk and are due tomorrow also 
at the Information Desk. Execu
tive candidates should have 100 
activities-fee-paying students 
signatures to run, while Senate 
candidates need 25 signatures 
from students in their respective 
colleges. Good luck to all of you 
who decide to run! Its definitely 
an adventure.
As always, if you have any com
ments, questions, or concerns, 
please e-mail me at cmu5@cmu. 
edu.

Dear Rachael,
I was drunk, and I met a guy. And 
he was nice, and all. But what 
happens on drunken escapades 
stays there, right? Apparently, I 
was wrong. Now, he wont stop 
calling and texting me, despite 
my obvious efforts to ignore 
him  by say, not picking up 
my phone, or ignoring his text 
messages. And every time I try 
to make it seem like Im not the 
girl for him  by say, telling him 
that Im a vegetarian lesbian 
with two kids and a baby-daddy 
back home  he accepts it and 
thinks its okay. Really, I should 
be flattered, but instead Im 
annoyed. Its rude to try to make 
a relationship out of a little drunk 
making out, right? Tell me what 
to do before I lose my mind.
Dangerously Disgruntled 
Dandy
Gday Triple D,
Quite obviously, the problem here is 
that this character is more interested 
in you than you are in him. Which 
tends to happen when youre a hot 
piece. So congratulations on that.
But you know that thing, honesty? 
Its pretty dandy, a lot like yourself. 
Of course, its easier to be honest 
with people you absolutely hate, 
or with people who arent as nice 
to you as he is, but all that doesnt 
matter. Because the truth/see, it 
wilt set you free. Not free from your 
impending college debts, but free 
from this whole charade. Say to this 
fellow, that youre sure you had a 
good time despite your inebriation, 
but drunken hook ups are not meant 
to be taken seriously. Hes a nice 
little (or big?) thing, really, but hes 
just not for you. And seriously, say 
that you dont know how far hes 
going to get in life with the clinging 
on, because its super annoying. Or 
you could always ask him for a little 
space and then never get back to 
him. Its up to you, really.
Give em hell!
Rachael
Dear Rachael,
A few weeks ago, a friend of 
mine from back home named Jill 
called me, as she usually does. I 
used to enjoy hanging out with Jill 
during breaks from school. Wed 
have a great time, and generally 
laugh at the people around 
us. We didnt really like those 
people, whoever they were, and 
so a majority of our time was 
spent feeding our respective 
superiority complexes and being 
giant bitches. Thats all well and 
good, but sometime in the past 
six months, Jill turned into the 
worst person on the planet. How 
do I tell her that shes being a shedevil and that our mutual friends 
cant stand her anymore?
Aint Too Proud to Bitch
Hey there, None Too Proud,
I think I like you. You keep it real, 
and you should continue to do 
that by being blunt with your semiex-friend, and giving her as much 
harsh reality as you possibly can. 
Because seriously, she needs it. If 
shes already used to you being, by 
your definition, a giant bitch, then 
she cant really get offended by you 
giving her hell for what and who she 
has become. Because thats who 
you are, and she knows that.
Or you could just laugh at her, 
like the two of you laughed at the 
people around you. Maybe then 
shell realize that you dont like her 
anymore and shell either change or 
... well, not change. So Id say take 
action! Let her know. Keep it real. 
She may not thank you for it, but 
youll thank yourself. Sawy?
Keep on keepin on!
Rachael

Sarah Mogin E MnraPsiroiGUrDf
We are knee-deep in springtime here in the 'Burgh, If optimists and' 
newcomers to the area thought that the transition of seasons would 
be a steady one, they must be rethinking that assumption now. But 
just because the sn cannot be depended on just yet, there is no 
reason to feel that the drizzly days are mucked up.
To help you stay impervious to the changeable weather, here is my 
advice: Get your galoshes on and your iPod loaded. On top of anything 
jazz or blues, check out the following songs to keep you jiving during 
these rainy times:
Thom Yorke  And It Rained All Night. The song is brilliant in 
its frenzy of electrnica sounds, funky beats, and clever lyrics. The rim 
shots mimic the sound of falling rain while the searing synth exudes 
a paradoxical type of mellow aural lightening. The overall effect is a 
Radiohead vibe with the exact indefatigable motion needed to carry 
anyone through the grayest of days.
Anne Peebles  I Cant Stand the Rain. The sound is simple: 
percussion, plucked stringed instruments, very light keyboards, great 
female soul vocals. Not a huge hit outside of Europe when it was first 
released, I Cant Stand the Rain gradually arrived at the position of 
acclaim it deserves. Peebles sings moving lyrics for when it is really 
pouring.
Tracy Chapman  Let it Rain. I cannot select just one song from 
the 2002 release; the entire album is just such a solid art piece. 
Chapmans voice is strong and genuine. I recommend the title track 
and Almost in particular, but if you have time, sit with your favorite hot 
drink and relish the entire thing.
Josh Ritter  Rainslicker. Ritters whole album Hello Starling 
is worthwhile and alt-country and folk in persuasion. Rainslicker is 
a definite personal favorite because of its poetic lyrics and acoustic  
style. The song is calming and charming with its feeling of reverie  I 
catch myself singing to it every time.
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah  Sunshine and Clouds (And 
Everything Proud). I cannot explain why I love this song - all 1:02 
of it. Instrumental, it is like a defunct music box. -It starts, builds, and 
finishes with its manic funkiness before you realize what hit you.
Beirut  Elephant Gun. I just saw on my play count that I have 
succumbed to Elephant Gun a whopping 76 times, and I just got the 
album Lon Gisland EP a couple of weeks ago. It is smooth, clashing, 
moody, and layered with trumpet and accordion, and somehow 
Bavarian in sound. As the band advises, Let the seasons begin.

The Price of Sugar
Thursday, March 27 
10 12
A 2007 documentary that just 
barely missed the cut for an Oscar 
nomination, The Price of Sugar 
highlights the plight of Haitian 
immigrants who are put into forced 
labor in the Dominican Republic. The 
film deals mainly with the exploitation 
of the immigrants on sugar 
plantations where they work for paltry 
wages while being treated like cattle. 
The movie centers on a sympathetic 
Spanish priest, Father Christopher 
Hartley, who becomes the voice 
for these downtrodden people and 
brings them supplies. The film is 
narrated by actor Paul Newman and 
is a must see for pretty much anyone 
with a human heart.
Darfur Now
Friday, March 28 
8 10 12
Yet another documentary thats sure 
to draw heavy crowds, as Darfur Now 
(2007) takes a turn at attempting to 
shed more light on the near-genocidal 
situation in Africa. The film tells six 
intersecting tales that together aim 
to bring the viewer closer to what is 
truly going on. From Holiywood stars 
(George Clooney) to Presidential 
hopefuls (John McCain), nearly every 
facet of the American media shows up 
in this documentary with something to 
say. Some complain of overproduction, 
but the main idea of Darfur Now is that 
the situation is an important problem 
and that any attempt to spread the 
word is a great effort.
Paradise Now
Saturday, March 29 
10 11:45
Paradise Now is a 2005 foreign 
language film about two Palestinian 
men who are recruited to go on a 
suicide mission in Tel Aviv. It tells the 
story from their viewpoint, giving a 
unique perspective on one of the most 
shocking acts in the world today.
During the crews time on location in 
Palestine, a land mine exploded 1000 
feet from the shoot, an Israeli air strike 
was ordered on a nearby car, and the 
location manager was kidnapped. Even 
its Golden Globe for Best Documentary 
came with controversy as it was 
protested by both the state of Palestine 
and by groups of victims of suicide 
attacks. It is a movie that deserves 
to be seen, if only for its perspective 
showcasing the fact that some issues 
are not always black and white.

The Savages
Sunday, March 30 
8 10 12
An Academy-Award-nominated film 
for Best Original Screenplay and Best 
Actress, The Savages is a touching 
family drama with just a hint of 
comedy thrown in. Philip Seymour. 
Hoffman and Laura Linney play a 
brother and sister who come together 
to take care of their elderly father.
The movie explores all the pains that 
come with dealing with some of life's 
inevitable unpleasantries, like taking 
care of an ailing parent. Along the 
way, the two siblings learn how to 
better deal with their own problems. 
An extremely well made movie with a 
great cast that deals with core family 
values in a sensitive and caring way, 
The Savages is enough to make the 
typical Rambo moviegoer puke.

Studying abroad, Cuba or otherwise
No matter where you go, there are three great things that 
happen when you study abroad. The first is that you get 
thrown into a society completely different from the one 
you are accustomed to. This gives you the chance to 
investigate what people in this society value, what goals 
they have, and even what they think of the U.S.
This brings us to the second great part of studying 
abroad, which is the opportunity to spend some time 
away from home and reflect on the same components 
of your own life. What do you hold dear? What do you 
want to do in the world? Are these the right things to 
be prioritizing? Though you may never find a definitive 
answer, the time spent abroad allows you to zoom out, 
however briefly, and at least begin to think about these 
issues.
All of this cognitive exploration usually comes in the 
context of just having a good time and pursuing activities 
and'interests unique to the country you are visiting. If 
youre interested in history, for example, talking to local 
authorities on your countrys history is a great way to 
get accurate information and familiarize yourself with the 
personality of local people.
In short, whats great about studying abroad is that, as 
long as you are working to make your trip substantive, 
there are new things to be learned every day that you 
could never learn in an American university classroom.

Carnegie Tech holds its first mock trial 
meeting, which, according The Tartan, 
will let its future lawyers to allow their 
tongues full play. Later, the newspaper 
states that it expects a large audience, 
as, A great sensation is inevitable. The 
more you look into it, the more it seems 
like anything printed in 1908 is one giant 
sexual innuendo.
It was sad, states a Coca-Cola ad, 
when that great ship went down and 
the last thing to leave the sinking ship 
was a bottle of Coca-Cola. That's 
because all hands stuck to Coke in 
the end." Luckily, Coke wrote this 
good-humored ad a year before the 
good ship Coke-tanic sunk, in which 
thousands of cases of Coke were lost 
to the Atlantic.
Providing solace to students suffering 
from MASH withdrawal, a Tartan 
staffwriter quizzes devoted fans about 
their favorite show. Sample questions 
are Where is Hawkeye from?, What 
is Radars full name?, and How did 
you find any time to watch MASH while 
studying at Carnegie Mellon?
A woman employed by Carnegie Mellon 
suffers from muffinitis. After confirming 
that there were no nuts in her muffin 
with a local vendor, the woman made 
a nutty discovery after a couple bites. 
Despite the vendors assurances, the 
muffin contained nuts. Campus Police 
were contacted, and they noticed the 
girl had difficulty speaking and suffered 
from swollen eyes and mouth. Do you 
know the muffin man? If so, please 
contact health services immediately.
How many digits of pi do yoi) know? 
If its more than two, you might give 
enough of a damn to participate in 
Carnegie Mellons annual pi day. For
March 17 2003 the 2003 Pr09ram. students held a pi your professor" event and chalked 
8192 digits of pi on the sidewalks. An 
innocent bystander quickly corrected 
chalkers on digit 5459, which is clearly 
a 4, not an 8.

Carnegie Mellon alumnus Scott Weiss 
makes Jeopardy history, ending 
the show in a three-way tie with his 
contestants. Much more important, 
however, is his background at our 
school, serving as a teaching assistant 
for 21-111 Calculus for Humanities 
Students. Some complained that the 
show was rigged, as categories for the 
show included Humanitarian Integrals 
and "Polynomials and Their Authors.

It may or may not be your birthday.... Call your mother. Why are you 
celebrating? Take some time to reflect. Or get wasted and eat cake 
with some friends.
This is a great week... but not for you. Too bad you weren't born in 
July.
You will forget to watch a very good TV show, and end up doing a 
homework that won't even change your grade. Better luck next week.
Someone loves you very much. Maybe too much. Stay away from 
Tauruses.
Bad luck for you  and it will continue that way until you contribute to 
The Tartan with either money, time, or pizza. You have one week.
Someone will give you either a free lunch or a free punch in the face.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
Don't forget to do laundry today. Clothes make the man, unless you're 
a woman; then feel free to not wear clothes, or a Halloween costume.
Travel and live life. Unless you're a zombie. Check for food poisoning; 
in the .meantime take an asprin and lie down.
Xanadu band is Rush. 43 Across. Use the extra seconds you now 
have to invest in goldfish. Or the stock market.
Remember to download movies and get lots of rest. This is going to be 
an awesome week for you. Don't mind the invading vampires; they're 
really chill and they have good taste in music.
Fish? Fish are smelly, especially after three days. Sorry that you had to 
be born when you were. Complain to your mother. Tell her I say hi.

Roger McGuinn, a folk musician from Chicago, will perform at Carnegie Lecture Hall on Saturday, March 29. McGuinn's style fuses together rock and folk styles. In the late '60s, McGuinn 
was one of the founding members of The Byrds, one of the most influential bands of the time. The band recorded such songs as "Mr. Tambourine Man." Now, McGuinn (whose former 
name is Jim, not Roger) has a solo apt in which he performs with his acoustic guitar.
