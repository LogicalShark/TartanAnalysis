FRIDAYTHE TARTAN
Volume 95, Issue 7www.thetartan.org16 October 2000WRCT battles for right to play music outside
by Erin Szeto
Junior Staffwriter
While campus has seemed lively 
enough with giant smiley cookie 
balloons floating next to Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall and giant 
chickens running around in front of 
Doherty Hall, some students may 
have noticed what wasnt on cam
pus, namely the presence of CMUs 
radio station, WRCT.
Last semester, WRCT began what 
it called Propaganda Day where 
the radio station set up on campus 
every Friday and played music from 10 in the morning until five in the 
afternoon. Spinning everything 
from classic rock to techno, stu
dents, faculty and staff could enjoy 
the sounds of a livelier campus and 
walk to class humming the tunes of 
Bob Marley. Student organizations, 
such as Student Activities, and cer
tain University departments, such 
as Admissions, responded positive
ly to WRCT, which itself enjoyed 
the benefits of increasing the orga
nizations visibility while at the 
same time adding a welcome 
atmosphere to campus.
However, WRCT received several 
complaints from faculty members 
for being too loud. Aware of the 
complaints, WRCT attempted to 
compromise by lowering the vol
ume of the music and moving to 
different locations on campus, such 
as Purnell and the Merson 
Courtyard. However, faculty mem
bers continued to make strong 
objections and supported their 
complaints by reminding WRCT of 
a University policy stating that no 
one is permitted to make noise on 
campus before the end of classes, 
which is at approximately 4:30 pm. 
They firmly asked Student 
Activities to discontinue what 
WRCT had hoped would become a 
long-standing Friday tradition, and 
Student Activities was ultimately 
forced to comply. At the beginning 
of the fall 2000 semester, Student 
Activities informed the student-run 
radio station that it was no longer 
allowed to play music on campus.
Due to the University policy, 
WRCT didnt seem to have much 
choice in the matter and was forced 
to adhere to the shutdown. 
However, WRCT staff members

Dining facilities and services 
have both undergone changes this 
year that have prompted both 
praise and concern within the stu
dent body. To address students 
questions and suggestions, a 
University forum, cosponsored by 
the campus affairs committee of 
Student Senate and the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC) food 
committee, will be held this 
Thursday afternoon.
think the changes are very 
well received, said Jane Fahringer
of Dining Services. We need to 
communicate what the changes 
are and thats been an obstacle.
Information about differences 
from last year has been difficult to 
disseminate since first-year stu
dents are unclear of the previous 
system and upperclassmen tend to 
eat less on campus and, therefore, 
do not know all the details of the 
current system.
Many modifications have been 
made including expanding meal 
plans from weekly to biweekly 
time blocks and broadening meal 
blocks to be accepted in the UC 
and campus wide throughout the 
week instead of only on Sunday.
First-years are still required to par
ticipate in meal plans, but these 
changes provide greater flexibility 
in rationing spending and choos
ing dining locations.
There are also new choices with
in the UC food court. On the sec
ond floor of the UC the former 
Chic-Hens vendor is now The 
Marketplace and Roseli has 
become Pepperazi. These two new 
locations continue to offer the 
same foods as last year, but have 
expanded dining options by 
increasing the number of entrees 
served simultaneously, such as 
pizza by the slice from Pepperazi,

Intels proposed move into the 
basement of the University Center 
has caused a firestorm of debate 
amongst CMU students during the 
past week. Discussions have been 
raging on the misc.market elec
tronic bulletin board as students 
attempt to sort through the vari
ous issues which surround the 
scheme. Central to the debate is 
the mission of the University 
Center. Many students argue that 
having a corporate presence in the 
UC is counter to its mission.
' There is generally a distaste for 
having a corporation in the base
ment, said Marcin Jeske, senior 
computer science major and 
Senator for the School of 
Computer Science. [They] feel 
like its intruding on their lives.
However, the administration 
feel that a short-term stay in the 
UC of three to five years would not 
violate the policy. Permanent 
presence of Intel would not be 
consistent with the mission state
ment, said Michael Murphy, 
Dean of Student Affairs.
The mission statement reads: 
The University Center provides 
facilities for teaching and learning 
that may be used by the members 
of the community or external 
organizations whose primary pur
pose is education.
[Intels] investment and tem
porary presence will allow us 
eventual access for student pur
poses, precisely consistent with 
that mission, to space that is oth
erwise simply unusable, said 
Murphy.
Student Senate held a discus
sion during a Thursday meeting 
last week. During the meeting 
Jeffrey Bolton and Murphy 
expanded upon the Intel plans 
and fielded questions from those 
in attendance. While the adminis
tration has suggested that student 
organization will be able to use 
the renovated space when Intel 
leaves, the administration has 
provided no firm commitment. 
There is no initial plan on what to
do with the space after Intel, 
moves out, but the space will be 
usable in the form Intel leaves it 
in. There are no other plans on 
what to do with the space if Intel 
does not move in.
Jeske said that student organi
zations were in urgent need of 
more space as current spaces were 
lost to attempts to reclamation by 
University departments. Pointing 
to several organizations that cur
rent occupy space in Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall, he noted 
that the College of Fine Arts is cur
rently asking student organiza
tions that occupy spaces there to 
vacate them by the end of the aca
demic year. Jeske is a memebr of 
one of the organizations, Fringe.
While Jeske said that University 
administration claims that they 
are searching for alternate space 
in buildings such as the Old 
Student Center, it is their obliga
tion to students to renovate the 
basement with their own funds if 
necessary. Part of what the 
University offers students is that 
students will have a place to 
socialize, said Jeske. He added 
that the administration uses stu
dent organizations as a marketing 
tool to attract new prospective 
students. [This] is a challenge 
for them and it takes commit
ment, he said. It needs to be a 
priority.
Short-term, our priorities 
include upgrading undergradu
ates science labs moving design 
studios, etc. This space is current
ly not a priority for fundraising, 
said Bolton in response to a ques
tion by a student at the Senate 
meeting about alternative means 
for renovations.
If the Universitys priorities are 
elsewhere, said Jeske, then this 
is a good thing. In a suggested 
open letter to the administration 
written by Jeske on behalf of stu
dent organizations, suggested 
that Intel be required to renovate 
50 percent more space than they 
need for the immediate use of stu
dent organizations.
Jeske said that he had received a 
mixed response from the sugges
tion, and that he was still waiting to 
hear back from organization leadSee INTEL, page A3

CMU rises to the occassion: CMU celebrated the new Hans L. Merkle Floor in Posner Hall last 
Thursday with an international balloon race, an Army ROTC marching unit, and Scottish bagpipers. The 
event was designed to showcase the 20,000-square-foot addition, housing 28 faculty offices and the 
Carnegie Bosch Institute for Applied Studies in International Management.
UC room reservation problems continue
by Seth Mandel
Managing Editor
For Kappa Kappa Gamma, it was 
as if a gong had been sounded 
even before their Gong Show 
began. The annual event, which is 
Kappas largest philanthropic 
activity during the year, was sup
posed to be held in Rangos 
Ballroom this past Saturday night, 
but was forced into postponement 
due to a scheduling conflict. 
Reservations for the room were 
held by both Kappa and the 
Computer Science Departments 
social event, the Log-In Ball, 
which ended up occupying the 
room on Saturday night. The 
Kappa Kappa Gong show is a tal
ent show where judges can gong 
participants off stage.
According to event organizer 
Della Feher, philanthropy chair
woman of Kappa and junior 
English and psychology double 
major, she booked the room on 
March 20 and received multiple 
confirmations, as recent as three 
Weeks ago, that the group indeed
had the reservation.
[University Center Events 
Manager] Carolyn Manley did not 
know this [double booking] had 
happened until [AB Tech CoChair] Kevin Miller had emailed 
her and said he had another 
request for the same day, said 
Feher, adding that without Millers 
proactive intervention, it would 
have been likely that two large 
groups of people would have 
shown up for two events in the 
same room at the same time. It 
was Friday, October 6 when 
Manley notified Feher of the con
flict.
According to Manley, who is 
responsible for scheduling events 
in the University Center and other 
areas on campus, the error was 
due to a computer glitch associat
ed with a system upgrade from the 
end of last semester. She said that 
this occurrence was the only such 
problem experienced and the tran
sition had otherwise gone well and 
given the office the ability for mul
tiple schedulers to make reserva
tions at the same time.
Feher said that while she has
given the scheduling office the 
benefit of the doubt in this case, 
she questions how priority for 
events is determined.
[Manley] said something to the 
effect that it was just a frat thing.. I 
then explained what it was that we 
do and the fact that we have tick
ets, we have programs, we have 
outside performers. She just apol
ogized again and said that she 
would try to work on it later that 
day, said Feher.
I dont bump students groups 
for department groups, said 
Manley, who denied minimizing 
the events importance. She said 
every event is important to some
one.
Manley added that preference is 
strictly given on a first come, first 
served basis. She said that organi
zations can reserve rooms as early 
as one year before an event. The 
only exception is annual University 
events such as Homecoming or 
Commencement. These events 
only have preference in that they 
can request space earlier than 
other events, but once any reservaSee RESERVATIONS, page A3

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 16, 2000
IRE+1- OF
Israel lists demands for future peace summit with Palestine
National News
JERUSALEM (AP)  Israel will 
soon demand that Palestinians 
t;ake steps to end shootings by 
their police and re-arrest Islamic 
militants that have been freed in 
recent days, the Isreali govern
ment said Sunday ahead of a cru
cial Middle East summit. 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, 
meanwhile, held pre-summit 
talks with political faction lead
ers including those from the 
Islamic militants groups Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad.
' After more than two weeks of 
deadly fighting that has badly 
eroded trust on both sides, Israeli 
and Palestinian leaders grudging
ly agreed to attend Mondays sum
mit in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt in 
hopes of declaring a cease-fire. 
That goal is a far cry from opti
mistic assessments before the 
unrest that a final peace deal was 
within reach.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak sounded pessimistic 
Sunday, telling his Cabinet that he 
believed that the Palestinian lead
ership is not ready to make com
promises that would bring a last
ing peace. This is the harsh and 
cruel, but perhaps not permanent, 
reality, Barak said.
In the end we will make peace 
with the Palestinians, but the cur
rent Palestinian leadership is now 
showing that it is finding it very 
difficult to make decisions related 
to an agreement.
Israels army chief, Lieutenant 
General Shaul Mofaz, said that no 
matter what the results of the 
summit, the army has to prepare 
itself for long-term confronta
tions.
Palestinian leaders also issued a 
bleak forecast. I really urge peo
ple not to have high expectations, 
said senior Palestinian negotiator 
Saeb Erekat.
The Israeli government said 
after its Sunday Cabinet meeting 
that its goal at the peace summit is 
an immediate end to violence and 
the establishment of mechanisms 
to prevent a new outbreak of hos
tility. In a statement, the Cabinet
also said Israel will demand the re
arrest of Islamic radicals freed by 
Palestinian police during the fight
ing, the taking of steps to halt 
shooting by Palestinian police and 
militiamen, a halt to calls for vio
lence by the Palestinian media and 
the preservation of Jewish holy 
places in Palestinian-controlled 
territory.
Mondays gathering at the 
Egyptian resort was agreed upon 
after intense pressure from 
President Clinton and other world 
leaders. The good news is the 
parties have agreed to meet and 
the situation appears to be 
calmer, Clinton said Saturday. 
But the path ahead is difficult. 
After the terrible events of the past 
few days, the situation is still quite 
tense.
Seventeen days of violence that 
have led to the deaths of nearly 
100 people  most of whom are 
Palestinians  escalated danger
ously on last Thursday when a 
Palestinian mob beat two Israeli 
reserve soldiers to death, and 
Israel retaliated by firing rockets 
at Palestinian military command 
centers. Since then, low-level 
clashes and sporadic shootings 
have continued but the overall vio
lence has abated. In Palestinian 
refugee camps in Gaza, thousands 
of members of Arafats Fatah fac
tion urged Arafat to stay home. 
The Sharm el Sheik summit is an 
Israeli and American trick, one 
banner said.
In the volatile West Bank city of 
Hebron, dozens of Arab residents 
signed up for a new militia after 
thousands of mourners buried a 
man shot to death during clashes 
with Israeli troops a day before. 
The body was covered by a 
Palestinian flag, and borne by uni
formed Palestinian police. 
Gunmen fired into the air chanti
ng, revenge, revenge, and 
Down with the olive branch, long 
live the rifle!
Israeli TV newscasts repeatedly 
ran the film of the exultant mob 
stomping and beating the two 
reserve soldiers in Ramallah on
Thursday, and of a Gaza preacher 
delivering a Friday sermon that 
urged the faithful to kill the 
Jews.
The summit will be attended by 
Clinton, Barak, Arafat, Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak, U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, 
King Abdullah II of Jordan and a 
senior European Union represen
tative.
After days of intense negotia
tions, the Palestinians dropped 
their demand for the prior estab
lishment of an international com
mission of inquiry into the vio
lence, settling instead for a 
promise that it would be dis
cussed at the summit. Israel has 
said that it would only trust the 
United States to lead a fair 
inquiry.
Arafat also wanted the Israelis 
to pull back from the edge of 
Palestinian-controlled areas, and 
to loosen a closure in those areas 
that has been keeping thousands 
of Palestinians from traveling to 
jobs or relatives. The Israelis have 
said they are prepared to meet 
those demands once the violence 
abates.
Israelis, meanwhile, softened 
the language in their calls to 
Arafat to re-arrest dozens of 
Islamic militants freed in recent 
days.
The past two weeks have been a 
marked change from this past 
July, when negotiators at Camp 
David marveled at how far they 
had come. At that summit in the 
United States, the Palestinians 
were the first Arab negotiators 
willing to concede land Israel had 
captured in the 1967 Mideast war, 
and Barak violated two major 
taboos: discussing a return of 
Palestinian refugees, and sharing 
Jerusalem.
But the future of a Jerusalem 
shrine holy to both groups of 
people ultimately broke up those 
talks and a September 28 visit 
there by the leader of the hard
line Israeli opposition, Ariel 
Sharon, helped spark the current 
unrest.

Hawaii wins Miss America title
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP)  
Miss Hawaii Angela Perez 
Baraquio, an elementary school 
gym teacher, was crowned Miss 
America on Saturday night. The 24- 
year-old said she plans to promote 
character education during her 
reign.
Baraquio gasped when co-host 
Donny Osmond announced her 
name, and then hugged first run
ner-up Miss Louisiana Faith Jenkins 
before ducking down to receive the 
crown and begin the traditional 
runway walk. Miss California Rita 
Ng, the first Asian-American 
woman to win that states title, was 
second runner-up, followed by Miss 
Mississippi Christy May and Miss 
Kentucky Whitney Boyles.
Im standing in the top five and 
Im thinking How do they pick 
from 51 awesome, amazing, phe
nomenal wonderful girls whove 
become my best friends over the 
past three weeks? a breathless 
Baraquio said after the crowning.
Along with the crown, Baraquio 
won a $50,000 scholarship.
In addition to teaching at a 
Catholic elementary school in 
Honolulu, Baraquio is the schools 
athletic director and coaches bas
ketball, volleyball and track. She 
said she wants to obtain a masters 
degree in educational foundations 
and eventually become a school 
administrator.
Baraquio grew up with nine sib
lings in Hawaii, plays keyboard for 
an all-girl rock group called High 
Tide and did a hula dance for the 
talent competition.
U. of Chicago students rally for Middle East peace
(U-WIRE) CHICAGO  With 
clashes between Israeli military 
forces and Palestinian protesters

threatens to match  and possibly 
outstrip  all of the violent conflict 
that has occurred in the Middle 
East within the last four years,
members of the University of 
Chicago community gathered on 
the quads Wednesday morning for 
an event organizers called a Pause 
for Peace in the Middle East. Co
sponsored by Hillel and Rockefeller 
Chapel, the gathering included j 
diverse group of college student^, 
including a large group of proPalestinian student-protestors, 
well as a contingent of student,s 
supporting Israel.
Our efforts were to focus on 
peace through peace  that is 
peace won at the table, and ncjt 
peace through conflict, said Rabty 
David Rosenberg, director of thg

While Rosenberg and Dean 
Alison Boden of the Rockefeller 
Chapel led a prayer circle at the flag 
pole, representatives from the 
Muslim Students Association 
(MSA) and the Arab Union stood 
nearby, handing out fliers and

World News
Milosevic fans try to block changes
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)  
President Vojislav Kostunica met 
with his allies Sunday to discuss 
how to push Slobodan Milosevics 
rival camp into a definite agree
ment on how to share power in the 
countrys main republic, Serbia. 
After a week of pressure, 
Milosevics camp appeared 
Saturday to have agreed to 
demands by Kostunicas pro
democracy forces to dissolve 
Serbias hard-line parliament later 
this month and call early elections 
in the republic in December.
But in talks that ended last 
Saturday night, Milosevics allies 
appeared reluctant to agree to all 
details of a proposed interim gov
ernment where they would share 
key ministries with Kostunicas 
backers until early elections. The 
changes would effectively end the 
last vestiges of Milosevics old 
guard and replace them with pro
democracy supporters of 
Kostunica, who overwhelmingly 
won Yugoslav presidential elections 
last month.
At the end of negotiations 
Saturday, Zoran Djindjic, 
Kostunicas key aide, said 
Milosevics Socialist officials asked 
for another day of consultations.
Pro-democracy leader Vladan 
Baric told The Associated Press the 
Socialists would also hold their 
own meeting Sunday to discuss the 
joint negotiations.
The (joint) talks are coming to a 
conclusion and I think it will be def
initely finalized tomorrow, Baric 
said. We have reached an agree
ment which I think will hold 
because we talked with the top
Socialist officials. Pro-democracy 
forces have set a 10 am Monday 
deadline for the Socialists.
Another pro-democracy leader, 
Nebojsa Covic, suggested that new 
street unrest of the kind that forced 
Milosevic to concede electoral 
defeat could follow any renewed 
foot-dragging by the Socialists. 
Milan Milutinovic, Serbias presi
dent and a Milosevic appointee, 
when asked about the deadline, 
said only, Well see.
On Saturday, Milutinovic sug
gested that not all disagreements 
had been removed but that a 
December 24 early election date 
had been agreed upon.
Pro-democracy forces have 
demanded a completely new inter
im government, not only a reshuffle 
of the existing cabinet dominated 
by Milosevics allies. In particular, 
they have said four key ministries 
 the police, justice, information 
and finance  must be jointly run 
by the Socialists and Kostunicas 
people.
Meanwhile, Kostunica returned 
Saturday from a European Union 
summit in Biarritz, France, with 
pledges of $175 million in aid and 
words of encouragement. Although 
Kostunica assumed the federal 
presidency on Oct. 7, he must cut 
deals with the leaderships of the 
two republics  Serbia and 
Montenegro  to wield real power. 
The government in Montenegro is 
anti-Milosevic, but Serbias govern
ment represents the last major bas
tion of Milosevicas supporters.Putin may attend Mideast summit
MOSCOW (AP)  The Russian 
Foreign Ministry said Sunday that 
Russia was prepared to take part in
the Israeli-Palesrinian summit on 
equal footing with other partici
pants, indicating that President 
Vladimir Putin might attend thp 
meeting.
The Kremlin press service did not 
immediately confirm that Putiji 
would go to the summit Monday at 
the Egyptian resort of Sharm el 
Sheik, which was agreed upon after 
intense pressure from President 
Clinton and other world leaders. 
Russia is concerned in the success 
of the summit and because of this 
will be ready to participate in the 
summit on equal footing as the 
other participants, the ministry 
said in a statement.
Israel and the Palestinians agreed 
Saturday to attend the summit 
aimed at declaring a cease-fire. The 
summit will be attended by Clinton, 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barall, 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Anan, 
King Abdullah II of Jordan and a 
senior European Union representa
tive.
Russia is officially a co-sponsor of 
the Mideast peace process with t 
United States, but it has played a 
minor role up to now.
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
traveled to the Middle East last 
week to confer with Barak and 
Arafat.
Ivanov said on Friday that Russia 
would continue its mediating role, 
and stressed that it was crucial to 
keep the violence from growing. 
Ivanov is one of a number of inter
national envoys who have been 
shuttling between Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders. Arafat on 
Wednesday called on Russia to 
increase its participation in Mideast 
peacemaking and to support his 
people.

looking at performers such as

just want the students to be happy 
and have a good Homecoming.
[Alumni Relations] made a 
commitment for $1,000 and they 
raised $5,000, which is a lot of 
money. They may have hoped to 
raise more, but that is the nature of 
fund raising, said Michael 
Murphy, the dean of Student 
Affairs.
The Office of the President and 
the Division of Student Affairs will 
provide any additional funding. 
Murphy said that he expected the 
two groups combined to fund 
between $15,000 and $20,000. 
According to DeFrank-Cole, stu
dent organizations were asked for 
support before the President and 
Student Affairs, however, because 
the more money they put into the 
concert, the less they can con
tribute to other special projects.
While Murphy said that Student 
Affairs has planned on funding the 
concert since last spring, other 
organizations werent contacted 
until this semester. According to Ko 
Nakatsu, a junior design major and 
SDC president, SDC was only con
tacted late September, but decided 
to contribute $5,000. The voting 
members of SDC, even though we 
didnt have input into the logistics 
of the event, decided to help fund 
Blues Traveler anyway because we 
still wanted to support a good 
cause, said Nakatsu.
Nakatsu, however, questioned 
Alumni Relations contributions to 
the concert. I heard that Alumni 
House wants to connect the current 
students with alumni but if Alumni 
House is reducing their support for 
the concert by a significant amount 
during Homecoming, a perfect 
event for alumni and students to
get together, then I question their 
thought process because it doesnt 
coincide with their actions, said 
Nakatsu. Student Activities had to 
take it upon themselves to come up 
with the financial means to make 
this event possible for the students. 
I think the bigger issue here is that 
there are two administrations that 
are not working together and thats 
a common theme throughout 
Carnegie Mellon.
There were also complaints 
about the Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA) not contributing 
to the concert. Ronald Fernandes, a 
doctoral candidate in public policy 
and management and president of 
GSA, who was approached about 
aiding in the funding at the end of 
September, said he wasnt sure why 
the assembly decided to vote 
against contributing to the concert. 
We are already funding a special 
alumni Happy Hour on Friday 
night, so I guess the assembly just 
didnt feel it was within our bud
get, said Fernandes.
I dont think anyone can be mad 
though. [GSA isnt] required to 
help out with a concert on 
Homecoming, said Hanks.
I am not aware of GSAs ratio
nale, but they fund many activities 
on the campus, so I am sure they 
felt it was a difficult choice... They 
will reserve their funds for future 
campus events that they feel more 
enthused about, said Murphy.
Contributions to the Concert 
have been made by many different 
organizations: AB concerts,
$15,000, Student Senate, $10,000, 
SDC, $5,000, Homecoming Special 
Events, $5,000, Laurel Networks, 
$5,000, and Alumni Relations 
$6,000.
University names new vice provost 
to develop corporate relationships
by Cory Tong
Junior Staffwriter
As connections between the 
University and outside corpora
tions become more prominent, it 
becomes more important to have 
someone to represent the 
University in communications 
between the two industries. With 
the recent naming of Christina 
Gabriel as the new Vice Provost for 
Corporate Partnerships and 
Technology Development, the 
University hopes that she will take 
that role.
Gabriels new role will put her in 
charge of the interactions between 
the University and different corpo
rations. She feels that both the 
school and the students benefit 
from these partnerships.
If the university has good rela
tions and makes right partner
ships; the students are able to have 
exposure to the types of corpora
tions out there and allows them to 
perhaps differentiate between 
which ones they would like to 
work for in the future. The 
University then receives grants 
and gifts from corporations to 
fund students research. In return, 
corporations are able to choose 
first hand from observation, who 
they want to be a part of their com
pany. said Gabriel.
She will be in charge of directing 
relations with not only corpora
tions interested in funding CMU 
students for their research in fields 
beneficial to them, but also with 
institutions such as the University
of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh area 
museums. Gabriel believes that 
this all follows a chain, stemming 
from research that leads to innova
tion which needs to be commer
cialized. Much of this is now pos
sible from the Bayh-Dole Act 
passed in 1980, which revolution
ized University and corporate 
world relations. Before the legisla
tion was passed, the United States 
government would receive the 
money from inventions or patents. 
However, the University now gets 
federal money for the research but 
more importantly gifts or aid made 
from the patent would go towards 
the school.
This allows for much more 
incentive to make progress in the 
research area since individuals 
now have a reason to further their 
studies due to potential benefits, 
said Gabriel.
When asked about her feelings 
on Intel Corporation using space 
in the schools University Center; 
Gabriel felt that by the time she 
arrived the deal had already been 
mostly completed. She said she 
strongly believes the UC is there 
for the students purpose first and 
foremost. On the other hand, she 
also emphasized that the school 
did not have the funding needed 
to transform the extra space for 
useful purposes, and with Intel 
occupying it now for a short while 
it will actually benefit the stu
dents and the school in the long 
run.
As Carnegie Mellon moves to 
the next level in terms of its part
nership with corporations 
enhancing even further our 
research, education, philanthrop
ic, and technology transfer efforts
 we are very fortunate indeed to 
be able to bring Gabriel into this 
important position, said Provost 
Mark Kamlet. We could not have 
invented someone with better tal
ent, background and experience 
for us in this area.
Although a native of Pittsburgh, 
Gabriel left in 1978 after getting a 
degree in electrical engineering 
from the University of Pittsburgh, 
to receive her masters in 1981 and 
doctorate in 1985 from the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology 
After graduating, Gabriel did 
research for AT&T Bell Labs for six 
years and also became the first 
female engineering professor at 
University of Tokyo while doing an 
exchange in Japan. Later, in 1991, 
she went on to coordinate a $50 
million university-industry 
Engineering Research Centers pro
gram for the National Science 
Foundation. Then in 1994, Gabriel 
served as one of three majority 
professional staff members on the 
U.S. Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee for Veteran Affairs. 
She was also vice president for 
research and technology at Case 
Western Reserve University before 
returning to CMU.
Gabriel said that she is excited to 
be back at Carnegie Mellon 
University after what she considers 
as a transformation of CMU from a 
good school to a world class insti
tution with greater focus on 
research.WRCT finds resistance in outdoor broadcasting
Crime and Incident Report
WRCT, from page A1 
noticed early in the year that their 
'organization was seemingly the 
only one that was being held 
-accountable for breaking the noise 
policy. It seemed like we were the 
Only ones being targeted. People at 
the Fence play music constantly, 
and Student Activities brings in 
bands all the time to play on cam
pus. There was even a time when 
B94 was here. How can the school 
jell its own radio station that it 
hant set up on campus, and then 
let an outside one do it? Its an 
^Unfair double standard, said 
Amaury Rolin, WRCT general 
manager and a senior in mechani
cal engineering and biomedical 
health engineering.
To settle the problem, Student 
Activities acted as mediator during 
several negotiations between 
WRCT and the Administrative 
Board. The two parties have since 
reached a suitable compromise. 
''Starting on Friday, October 13,
WRCT is permitted to set up in 
front of the Merson Courtyard from 
noon onward. However, they must 
keep the volume low, and will be 
shut down if they receive so much 
as one complaint.
John Ketchpaw, WRCT program
ming manager and a junior com
puter science major, was frustrated 
with the whole situation, but 
appreciates the help WRCT 
received from Student Activities. I 
think the problem should have 
been dealt with more through the 
campus police, but it was good to 
have Student Activities working for 
us. I guess we just have to be careful 
whose toes were stepping on, he 
said.
Brian Levinthal, a sophomore 
cognitive science major, is glad to 
see WRCT back on campus. 
WRCT gives students a good 
chance to express themselves. If 
other organizations can play music 
on campus, then I dont see why 
WRCT cant, he said.
10/13/00 PRANK  At 12:15 pm the 
victim phoned Campus Police to report that 
while sitting on the second floor of one of 
the fraternity houses on the Quad, an 
unknown person shot mashed potatoes at his 
window. The victim reported that there 
were three to four shots of mashed potatoes 
that hit his window and a nearby brick wall 
on the house. Campus Police did not 
observe anyone or anything that may have 
caused the incident when they arrived on 
the scene. t'
10/10/00 HARASSMENT  Campus 
Police were contacted by the victim who 
stated that her America Online Instant 
Messenger account had been hacked into. 
She received a phone call on her cellular 
telephone at 1 am, and the caller said that 
the phone number was obtained from her 
AOL account. The victim stated that she has 
no suspects in the area, but said that an 
acquaintance from high school threatened to 
slash her tires and back into her house. The 
acquaintance has also been stalking the vic
tim. The victim said that people, like CS 
majors, search for and obtain Andrew pass
words. When the victim went to change the 
Instant Messenger password, she noticed 
that the password had been changed to 
penis, and was not a friendly prank in her 
opinion.
10/9/00 MEDICAL  Campus police 
responded to Doherty Hall at 4:30 pm to 
respond to a victims cut finger. Upon the 
polices arrival EMS were already treating the 
victim. The victim was transported to health 
services to be evaluated. He stated that he 
obtained the cut while trying to force a hard 
tube into a glass tube, and the glass tube 
broke.
10/9/00 COUNTERFEIT  A
Carnegie Mellon affiliate obtained $100 in 
cash from a Mellon ATM in the University 
Center, which he then proceeded to spend 
on food and other items on campus. The 
victim then proceeded to drive to a phar
macy in Monroeville where he attempted to 
purchase $16 worth of goods from the 
pharmacy. The cashier notified the affiliate 
that the $20 bill he was attempting to use 
was .fake, and demanded his drivers
license. The victim refused, and the cashier 
notified the police, who asked the victim 
where he obtained the money. The victim 
responded, and the police allowed him to 
proceed on his way. The victim was upset 
that the police seemed unconcerned about 
the fraudulent money being distributed 
from the Mellon ATM, and that the 
Monroeville Police had been rude in his 
opinion.
10/8/00 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF 
Campus Police responded to a call from a 
campus organization on the third floor of the 
University Center at 2:15 am. The caller stat
ed that unknown actors removed two blue 
chairs and a couch from the lounge area near 
the door to Skibo and proceeded to push the 
items up and down the third floor corridor. 
The unknown actors caused extensive dam
age to the campus organizations door when 
they slammed a couch into the room. The 
door could not secured, due to the damaged 
doorjamb. The door frame was also severely 
damaged.

Room reservation methods cause controversy
"RESERVATIONS, from page A1 
tion is made, it is not changed for another 
group, according to Manley.
In this conflict, however, Manley agreed that 
Kappas reservation from March was indeed 
earlier than the Log-In Balls request, which 
University Center Director Marcia Gerwig esti
mated as occurring during the summer.
In this case, I had this huge event [the LogIn Ball] that consists of between 300 and 600 
people. Its all about negotiation. So I tried to 
negotiate with both. I saw that maybe there was 
another weekend we could hold the Gong 
Show, said Manley.
Accommodating Accommodations
I absolutely positively do not bump or drop 
groups without asking them if they can help 
out, she said, adding that sometimes she might 
ask a group if an alternative arrangement 
would be acceptable so that another group 
could be accommodated. Manley, along with 
University Center Director Marcia Gerwig, said 
that the scheduling office works hard to be 
accommodating and help student groups plan 
events, especially since students generally tend 
not to plan events far enough in advance.
Justin Elker, AB Films chair and a senior poli
cy and management major, said that he has had 
a lot of experience making reservations in the 
UC due to the large number of movies AB 
shows. He said that while they have occasion
ally been unable to show a movie or have had to 
cut showings, he has in general been satisfied 
with the room reservation process.
Weve seen [reservation changes] happen to 
other organizations as well, and weve helped a 
lot of groups by giving them use of McConomy 
when theyve been unfairly removed from their 
reserved rooms. For instance, we cancelled a 
showing of Pleasantville to give Soundbytes a 
venue to perform a show that theyd been prac
ticing for, only to be told that their room wasnt 
available anymore because of Wonder Boys film
ing.
Elker believes there are some groups on cam
pus that should take more responsibility with 
respect to scheduling and following through on 
events.
Last spring, Films had to cancel a movies 
first showing because another organization had 
McConomy reserved. You cant imagine how 
disappointed we were when this organization 
didnt even show up for their UC scheduled 
event, said Elker.
An Isolated Incident?
I had no reason ever to believe there would 
be a problem. I have never had a problem 
before, said Feher who added that she has 
made reservations before for other organiza
tions she is involved with. Speaking with peo
ple from other organizations, they told me that 
is what you should expect, she said, explaining 
that she had since heard of many other similar 
problems.
Although Manley and Gerwig said this prob
lem was an isolated incident, AB Tech co-Chair 
Kevin Miller, a senior computer science major, 
said that scheduling problems are nothing new. 
He said that one weekend last year, Spirit, T3, 
and Scotch n Soda all had reservations in 
Rangos. He said that this overbooking caused 
logistical problems for AB Tech because various 
equipment had to be set up throughout other 
events and new equipment, which cost the stu
dent body money, had to be purchased to pull 
off the technical feat.
Miller also pointed out problems with out
door reservations, such as when AB Tech was 
given permission to set up for the Rusted Root 
concert, but the Kiltie Band also had the CFA 
lawn reserved. While the situation worked out 
in the end, according to Miller, he was told at 
the last minute that the Kiltie Bands reserva
tion was one that the scheduler said she kept in 
her head.
Gerwig said that outdoor reservations are 
indeed a more informal process.
Outside space uses should come through
this office, but sometimes folks go to Grounds 
and we arent informed. Folks assume they 
dont have to reserve the space  its a little 
more complicated, said Gerwig.
AB Tech co-Chair Megin Wardle, a senior in 
the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program, 
said that part of the problem is that the sched
uling system is closed, meaning that event plan
ners do not have access to view the scheduling 
information to confirm events on their own. 
Gerwig said that this problem is being 
addressed by a new system that will allow event 
organizers to check room availability and con
firm room reservations online. She said the sys
tem is currently being tested and should be 
available by next semester.
The people who work in reserving UC rooms 
have a lot to deal with. Theyre put under a lot 
of pressure and are in constant communication 
with multitudes of university groups and orga
nizations, said Elker.
Gong Goes On
Feher said that although the conflict caused 
inconveniences and stress for a number of the 
sisters, no actual money was lost due to the con
flict.
The Kappa Kappa Gong show will now be 
held on November 19 in Rangos. While Feher 
said she has rolled with the punches and not 
gotten too upset about the conflict, she said that 
the new date is not ideal. According to Feher, it 
will be held on the same night as Dancers 
Symposium, which she believes means the 
events will have to compete for attendees. 
Although since resolved, AB Tech originally was 
unsure if they could even work the Gong Show 
because of their responsibilities with the 
Symposium, which will be held in CFAs Kresge 
Theater. In addition, Feher said that many of 
the original outside performers were unable to 
attend on the rescheduled date.
The money raised by the show this year will 
help Debra House, a local homeless shelter for 
families.
Stove burner in sorority house kitchen causes fire
by Sara Stille
News Editor
Last Thursday afternoon, the 
residents of the Kappa Alpha 
Theta (Theta) sorority house were 
forced to temporarily evacuate 
their house due to a fire in their 
kitchen. Around 1:30 pm on 
Thursday, a resident of the house 
contacted Campus Police to report 
a fire in their kitchen after a plas
tic cutting board leaning against 
the wall near the stove fell onto a 
burner that had been left on.
Liya Zheng, a sophomore in 
H&SS and a member of Theta, was 
in the house when the fire started. 
All of a sudden a fire alarm went 
off and since the alarm was very 
soft, no one heard it, so I panicked 
and went upstairs to get people, 
said Zheng. I have never been in 
such a situation before but luckily 
there was a fire extinguisher in the 
kitchen we read the instructions on 
the spot and attempted to put the 
fire off with it.
When the fire extinguisher did
nt seem to be diminishing the 
flames, Campus Police instructed 
the girls to pour flour or Bisquick 
on the stove to smother the 
flames. By the time Campus Police 
and the Fire Department arrived 
on the scene, the fire had already 
been put out, but the first floor of 
the house was still filled with 
smoke and dry chemical residue 
from the extinguisher.
There was damage done to the 
stovetop, cabinet, and immediate 
wall area, which is being taken
care of, said Lauren Darby, a 
sophomore design major and 
member of Theta. The-Campus 
Police report stated that damage 
to the kitchen included a melted 
right rear burner on the stove, a 
melted plastic light cover above 
the stove, and dry chemical 
residue covering the kitchen and 
dining area.
According to Darby, the informa
tion she received on Friday and at a 
sprinkler information session on 
October 11, the fire alarms and 
sprinkler system actions met the 
specifications that were required of 
them in this particular situation. 
There were complaints, however, 
that there was only one battery 
operated alarm sounding during 
the event. According to FMS, the 
fire alarms had been disabled while 
work was being done on the Tech 
House. They said that the alarm 
would still register with Campus 
Police, though.
After the fire, a maintenance 
request was submitted to have the 
first floor extinguisher recharged.
Members of Theta were grateful 
for the immediate responses and 
support from other sororities, said 
Darby. We thank CMU Housing, 
Student Life and the Fire 
Personnel for their effective and 
understanding responses. We also 
appreciate the support and con
cern of the other sorority women, 
said Darby.
I can not express with words 
how thankful I am that none of 
my sisters got hurt and we didnt 
lose our house to the fire, said 
Zheng.

Committee gathers feedback regarding campus dining
DINING, from page A1 
Jand expanding value meals.
 The Middle Eastern food vendor 
s'Ali Baba closed its location on the 
Second floor of the UC and dining 
^services and the SDC food commit
tee are exploring options for a 
^replacement. Although plans are 
3iot finalized for the new vendor, 
She sentiment in Senate and SDC 
food planning meetings indicates a 
T-heed to meet the campus demand 
dfor vegetarian cuisine.
I The SDC food committee has a 
/history of being influential over 
dining matters and continues 
-working to address students com
plaints and concerns. The food 
^committee has acted on_ issues 
ranging from the minor, such 
^replacing the stock of bubble gum, 
.to the much needed, such as hav
ing the Grab N Go clear walk space 
^overnight, said Christine 
r^Blankertz, SDC food committee 
chair and sophomore business 
^administration major. 
b* The food committee and Dining 
Services have both played a role in 
ethe conversion of Highlander from 
csall-you-can-eat to a la carte. The 
changes were intended to create 
more of a social atmosphere... and 
somewhere people enjoy eating, 
:said Blankertz. Plans for the cafete
ria are being developed and a 
redesign will occur over winter 
^break.
 With Highlander now on a payper-item basis, the once bustling 
'^cafeteria serves only a fraction of 
the quantity of patrons from last 
L-year. That student traffic has been 
absorbed by UC and other campus 
-vendors.
: The vendors do not really proivide meals, but instead portions of 
meals. They are certainly well suit-: 
ed for lunch, but were never really 
Intended to meet the majority of
the dinner needs of the student 
body, said Neil Lareau, a junior 
art major and CFA Student Senate 
representative. Lareau pointed out 
that the camptis no longer offers 
cafeteria food during dinner hours. 
Schatz, the only remaining all-youcan-eat cafeteria, only operates 
during breakfast hours.
Now that the all-you-can-eat 
option is gone, students may find 
the new value meals in the UC 
more appealing. However, many 
students feel that the value meal 
options in place at UC vendors 
save only minimal amounts of 
money over the listed price of a 
meal and in some instances can 
even cause overcharging. Last 
Saturday, a $5.50 value meal from 
the Marketplace consisting of 
chicken bites, two sides, and a 16- 
ounce drink saved only a nickel 
over the individual purchase of 
the items. If only one side is 
requested, the meal still fills a sin
gle plate but is reduced in price to 
$4.75.
Besides the money issue, stu
dents are also concerned with the 
quality. Aurin Bhattacharjee, a 
first-year student in H&SS and an 
H&SS Student Senate representa
tive, expressed concern for the 
quality of food on campus after

changes in UC and Highlander selections. These changes, however, have 
resulted in lower attendance at Highlander cafeteria.

were saying we need more, he said. 
People generally like the idea.
We have not had any discussion 
with Intel on this suggestion, said 
Murphy. We are continuing to 
gather concerns on campus and 
will work to get them resolved in 
the coming weeks.
The recently-formed Student 
Activist Headquarters (SAHQ) 
passed out flyers on Friday in front 
of Doherty Hall providing informa
tion on the Intel deal. The flyers 
were intended to be a neutral 
source of information reflecting 
facts and concerns that were 
expressed at the Senate meeting.
According to Paul Jacobs, a fifthyear senior in business administra
tion who is involved in SAHQ, the 
organization was originally going 
to put out a petition against Intel 
moving into the UC. However, 
members could not reach a consen
sus on the issue.
Jacobs said he sees students as 
having three general opinions about 
Intel: they are against Intel com
pletely, they have reservations about
Intel and feel that the University 
should insure the deal benefits stu- ; 
dents, or they feel that Intel coming 
to CMU presents clear opportunities 
and benefits for the community.
I myself changed my opinion 
after meeting with Dean Murphy, 
said Jacobs, who said he was initial
ly suspicious of Intels corporate 
influence, but thinks the deal would : 
be beneficial if the basement space 
is made usable, and the University t 
addresses possible concerns.
Im very opposed to [the deal]  
personally, said Anne Leete a senior 
in English and member of SAHQ. I I 
think it sets a bad precedent for the  
University to allow corporations to ; 
be here physically. Leete said that 1 
she thinks there is a lot of support 
for a petition against the move, and 
she said she might start one.
The Senate meeting on Thursday j 
curbed the discussion on the Intel 
debate in favor of a University-wide : 
forum. This forum, which Murphy 
will attend, will occur this 
Wednesday at 4:30 pm at a location j 
to be announced.

campus and boosting activism. At 
the forums, the debates are tele
vised, giving students the opportu
nity to exchange their various, 
unique opinions on politics  
essential for generating political 
discourse in a campus that, accord
ing to Jacobs, has notoriously been 
thought of as politically indifferent.
October 3rd marked the com
mencement of the debates and the 
first forum, which was held in the 
McConomy Auditorium and 
attended by approximately 100 stu
dents. There was an outward criti
cism of many of the points brought 
up by Bush and Gore which was 
refreshing. As students were leav
ing, you could hear a number of 
conversations regarding certain 
issues and general discussion cen
tered on which candidate they 
believed to be more engaging, or 
who had won the debate, said 
Jacobs of this first forum.
The second forum, held in the 
Connan Room had a slightly differ
ent format. Prior to the debate, a 
panel consisting of representatives 
from the various different political 
clubs on campus spoke about their 
partys views and presidential can
didates. The panelists consisted of 
Victor Cohen of the CMU Labor 
Party, Blake Scholl of the CMU 
Objectivists Club, Brian Niemann 
of the CMU Republican Club, Scott 
Sandage of the CMU History
Department, Leslie Johns of the 
CMU Green Party, Anne Leete of 
the CMU Democrats Club, and a  
member of the University of; 
Pittsburgh International Socialist i 
Organization. Each panelist was j 
asked to define what student inter- 1 
ests were in their respective parties, j 
Some of the many topics discussed  
during the forum included how : 
many people age 18-24 feel that  
politics were unrelated to them and  
that they could do nothing to 
change the situation. Other popu
lar topics were education, the envi-. 
ronment, universal healthcare, liv- J 
ing wage, tax cuts, and affirmative 
action. Several groups, including 
the Labor Party and Objectivists 
Club, are not indorsing a presiden
tial candidate because they feel { 
that no candidate exemplifies their.,

CMU should say no to Intel
Editorial dissent
Editors note: Sriram Gollapalli worked at Intel this past summer.
Groups should fund concert
larger problem of insufficient funding, and 
a quick fix that undermines the credibility 
and mission of Carnegie Mellon. 
Corporations that conduct private business 
on the CMU campus violate the education
al goals of this University. There are dan
gers in University research becoming 
entangled in corporate research goals. One 
example is the effect the Intel solution cen
ter could have on what is taught in CMU 
classes. By using Intel research, CMU pro
grams might focus on technology devel
oped at the solution center, which could 
cause it to ignore similar, possibly superior, 
technologies. In addition, by developing 
solutions that will eventually be marketed, 
Intel's research is inherently biased. Intel 
will tend to develop solutions that meet the 
immediate needs of its clients, which may 
not necessarily be the best for members of 
the University who share the research.
In the upcoming days, students will have an 
opportunity to express their misgivings about 
the Intel move onto campus by telling admin
istrators that it is fundamentally a bad idea. 
Until now, the administration has asked for 
input about how it can make the Intel solution 
center easier for students to deal with. The 
administration, which should have notified 
students about the possibility of the solution 
center earlier in the discussions, seems to have 
overlooked the greater concern that the solu
tion center does not fit in with the University's 
goals. Instead it has treated the solution center 
as a necessary evil that must happen in order 
for the UC basement to be renovated.
By allowing Intel to physically be on cam
pus, the University makes a dangerous 
exception that blurs the line between what is 
and what is not considered undue corporate 
influence on campus. The University will 
send a message out: Carnegie Mellon, 
although it pretends to be an institution that 
puts its educational values first, will put 
itself up for sale if the price is right.
lives. It will not interfere with academic mat
ters. The campus community should remain 
open-minded of the upcoming opportunity and 
look forward to what can happen.

Gollapalli, Sara Stille
Within weeks, the University could sign a 
deal that will allow Intel, a private corpora
tion, to set up a solutions center in the UC 
basement. The University would be making 
the wrong decision by allowing Intel to move 
into the UC and CMU in general because it 
violates the mission statement of the UC and 
brings undue corporate influence to campus.
The UC mission statement says the UC 
should provide facilities for teaching and 
learning that may be used by the members of 
the campus community or external organiza
tions whose primary purpose is education. 
Intel's move into die basement of the UC 
would direcdy contradict this mission, as it 
will not be used for the purposes of education, 
but will ratiier allow Intel to profit from ecommerce solutions it develops in the center.
The administration, namely Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy, VP of 
Business and Planning Jeff Bolton, and 
President Jared Cohon have stated that the 
main reason that this Intel solution center 
should be in the basement of the UC is that it 
will benefit the University by allowing previ
ously un-renovated space to be renovated, so 
that after three to five years the community 
can use this space. The administration argues 
that, although permanent housing of the cen
ter in the UC would be against the UC mission 
statement, its temporary housing would allow 
the University to better fulfill this mission in 
the long run.
No one will argue that die UC space needs 
to be renovated. Student organizations like 
WRCT are desperate for space. But the reason 
the basement has not been renovated is 
because the Planning and Alumni Giving 
departments have not made it a priority to do 
so. A proper solution would be to make this 
renovation space a priority  not just the 9- 
15,000 square feet that Intel would be able to 
renovate, but the entire basement.
Housing a private industry within an 
educational institution is a quick fix to a
The Intel presence on campus will create new

and will not be intrusive to students day-to-day
When the Student Alumni Relations 
Council brought up the idea of bringing a 
big concert to campus for CMUs centennial 
Homecoming celebration, Alumni Relations 
decided they wanted to make that idea a 
reality. However, when the issue of funding 
for the Blues Traveler concert came up, 
Alumni Relations and the Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA) shirked their responsibili
ties. Specifically, Alumni Relations provided 
less funding than event organizers original
ly anticipated, and GSA refused to support 
the event. This failure to help out the con
cert put an unfair burden on the other 
groups involved and limits these groups 
ability to contribute to future events.
The organizational efforts put forth by 
Student Activities and AB Concerts are to be 
commended - members committed them
selves to making the concert happen regard

funding did not come through from Alumni 
Relations as expected, Student Activities 
was forced to turn to other organizations for 
help. The Student Dormitory Council and 
Student Senate stepped up by helping out an 
event that the much of the campus commu
nity will surely enjoy. In addition, the Office 
of the President and the Division of Student 
Affairs now have to provide additional funds

Alumni Relations should have accepted 
more of the financial burden for the concert. 
After all, thfey have promoted the event as 
part of Homecoming weekend and it is a 
large part of their effort to involve current 
students more with Homecoming Activities. 
It is respectable that they have responded to 
past criticisms that current students are not 
involved enough in Homecoming. However, 
by coming up with a great idea and then 
forcing student groups to handle both the 
preparation and the funding, they are avoid
ing their duties. In addition, it is very likely 
that a good deal of alumni will attend this 
event; for it is as a major part of 
Homecoming weekend. Alumni Relations 
should contribute its fair share, therefore.
Similarly, graduate students are certain to 
attend this concert. However, GSA, not follow
ing the appropriate action of SDC and Senate, 
refused to provide funding. Responsible lead
ers should step up in such situations, when the 
community needs their help.
Alumni Relations needs to follow through 
on its suggestions. Not only should it come 
up with ideas to involve students with 
Homecoming, but it should show that it 
really does care about current students by 
committing appropriate resources to such 
events. GSA should help out when it can, 
even when it is not explicidy required.

Wanted: reputable paper
Editor:
For years The Tartan has been the pri
mary source of misinformation on cam
pus. The reputation of The Tartan has 
dropped to a point that we only read it for 
the Crime and Incident Reports. This is 
the only place where you can find any 
truth or fact. In the rest of the paper, we 
find misquotes, misrepresentation and 
biases, all in the name of freedom of 
expression.
But it doesnt have to be this way. The 
Tartan is full of good people and writers, 
so why has it lost its credibility? Over the 
years, there has been a general decay in 
the moral standards that The Tartan 
holds itself to, What was once unaccept
able, over time has become more accept
able. The standards for unacceptability 
have fallen to new lows. A few years ago, 
you wouldnt find Tartan writers using 
their positions to perpetuate their person
al agendas; you wouldnt find them 
searching for anything, however negative 
or low it may be, just1 for attention, you 
wouldnt find that the student body is 
afraid to speak to the Tartan for fear of 
being misrepresented. Why has this level 
of deterioration happened?
A major segment of the student body 
that promotes campus activity, through 
philanthropic events, community involve
ment, improving student life, providing a 
voice for the student body, has had to face 
the fact that they will always be judged 
for their shortcomings and never reward
ed for their strides. Philanthropic activi
ties from the Greek community this year 
will gross at least $25,000. Will The 
Tartan write about this? No. This kind of 
news information is not newsworthy to 
The Tartan staff. Yes, they cover Greek 
Sing, but will they cover clothes drives 
that the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette considers 
newsworthy? No.
The past two issues were the last straw. 
Now the Tartan has come to unwarranted 
random assaults on student organiza
tions. For example, the piece written on 
the Olympics was especially offensive to 
both Pi Kappa Alpha and Alpha Epsilon 
Pi. Also, the comic strip depicting a soror
ity woman was particularly tactless, tar
geting a random group for no reason. It is 
somehow understandable to be poked fun 
when it is warranted, say, when an orga
nization is putting itself out there to be 
ridiculed. However, this is not the case 
with these incidents. These .are just two 
of the many examples that are now 
becoming commonplace in The Tartan.
Instead of letting a story develop 
through research, it seems as if The 
Tartan has their story planned ahead of 
time, and will do whatever it takes to 
make their research' match their vision. 
Such is the case with the Student Senate 
parking permit issue, where Pat 
Ditterline, last years Student Senate 
chair, was asked leading questions to ful
fill the reporters vision of the story, 
rather than discovering the facts of the 
story. If you were the president of this 
University and your vision for the school 
was consistent with an environment that 
promoted excellence but you overlooked 
cheating, what message would you be giv
ing? It is this sort of tunnel vision 
where the ends justifying means appears
to be the new Tartan philosophy.
For example, the Greek community has 
organizations in place, the InterFraternity 
Council, the Panhellenic Council, and 
also their National Offices, to hold them 
to the higher moral standard that they try 
to promote and uphold. Our entire cam
pus works on this kind of system: students 
have RAs, RAs have CAs, CAs have House 
Fellows, also known as administrators. 
The Tartan doesnt appear to have to 
answer to anyone.
We are not saying that other organiza
tions do not screw up, but they do hold 
themselves accountable. What happens 
when The Tartan screws up? In the past 
we have all been guilty of allowing The 
Tartan to do as they please, this is where 
it stops. We challenge the campus com
munity, from students to faculty and staff 
to administrators, to require The Tartan 
to live up to the same standards that 
Carnegie Mellon University tries to pro
mote and uphold. -We challenge the 
Tartan to do this themselves. We no 
longer condone their behavior. The 
Tartan is a funded organization like many 
other organizations, so you are paying for 
this unacceptable mistreatment. Email 
tartan@andrew.cmu.edu when you have 
absolutely any concerns, and let them 
know that Rina, Vilas and Maria sent you.

Misleading directions
Editor:
In this latest issue of The Tartan 
(October 9, 2000) I enjoyed reading 
the review of the Loews Waterfront VIP 
club service. However, I was dismayed 
to see that at the end of the article, the 
directions to the theatre were com
pletely inaccurate.
The directions given were to the 
Waterworks movie theatre in Fox 
Chapel. The Loews Waterfront (not 
Waterworks) theatre, however, is locat
ed in the brand-new Waterfront devel
opment in Homestead, on the other 
side of th.e city entirely.
Therefore, here is a correct set of 
directions to the Loews Waterfront the
atre in Homestead, where you can go 
and enjoy the VIP experience described 
in the article, or just go and enjoy a 
damn good movie. It's been my 
favorite place to see a movie ever since 
it opened this spring.
BUS DIRECTIONS:
The 61C, 64A, and 74A can get you 
there (I personally prefer the 61C since 
I know the route well). Basically, go to 
the bus stop at Forbes and Morewood 
on the UC/Warner Hall side and wait
for a bus that says Homestead on it.
BY CAR: (from Forbes and Morewood)'
Drive up Forbes Avenue through 
Squirrel Hill and make a right on 
Beechwood Boulevard. Beechwood 
winds and curves and snakes around 
until you reach an intersection with 
Browns Hill Rd. There will' be a 
Hollywood Video at about 11 o'clock on 
the far side of the intersection, and d 
Burger King right in front of that. Make 
a right onto Browns Hilll Road down 
the hill. This will take you across the 
Homestead High Level Bridge. About 
halfway across the bridge (yes, this is 
weird, but hey, it's Pittsburgh) there 
will be a light. Make a right off the 
bridge (there'll be signs at this point 
showing you where to go, and if you 
haven't seen the monstrous Loews on 
your right by this point, you're too 
oblivious to be allowed to drive any
way) .
That's it - enjoy the show!

Editor:
Please let me congratulate you on your 
coverage of the proposal by Intel to open a 
Solutions Center on our campus. Your arti
cles have been thorough and well-written, 
and youve done a good job of raising 
issues and soliciting thoughtful comments 
on both sides.
There are, indeed, many issues raised by 
the proposed solutions center. I believe 
that all of them are well understood, and 
that we can deal with them appropriately. 
Perhaps the most difficult issue, however, 
is the propriety of a corporate presence in 
a university building, and especially in the 
University Center. We all know well the 
purposes of the University Center, and I 
acknowledge that a long-term corporate 
office is not consistent with those purpos
es. But  and this is the key point  
Intels center will be temporarily located in 
the University Center until a suitable offcampus facility in Oakland is available. 
The length of that stay is still being negoti
ated (probably three years), but I assure 
you that we will define a date certain for 
Intel to move off campus.
Furthermore, the University almost cer
tainly would not have invested in the space 
that Intel will occupy during these three 
years. Thus, Intel will not supplant student 
activities. On the contrary, we will have 
finished space for use by students after 
Intel moves, and probably sooner dian it 
would have otherwise been available.
I think almost everyone would agree 
that Intels long-term presence .in 
Pittsburgh, close to but not on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus, is a good thing. 
The problem were dealing with is how to 
get from here to there. The University 
Center affords us a good interim solution, 
so long as the many issues raised by stu
dents and others can be resolved.

Follow conscience to the polls, make a vote for democracy
by Aseem Garg
Junior Staffwriter
In many countries, voting is a dangerous 
activity. Vote the wrong way and you could 
be killed, blacklisted, or tortured. In some 
of those countries, with substantial risk to 
their own well being, the people have voted 
their hearts and their consciences against 
those who would otherwise coerce them 
into surrendering democratic legitimacy to 
thuggery. Just look at Serbia and East 
Timor. In the past year, the peoples of both 
these places voted against repressive 
regimes. The'Timorese paid for the bravery 
with their own blood and the razing of 
their hoines by vengeful militias; the peo
ple of Serbia were able to overthrow 
Slobodan Milosevic.
But in this country, voting is not a danger
ous activity. No matter how you vote, you 
will not be tortured, killed or blacklisted. A 
secret ballot prevents that. If the people of 
East Timor and Serbia can vote their con
sciences, in the face of brutal retribution, 
then the free people of the United States of 
America, who face no negative consequences 
for voting their hearts, will always vote their 
consciences, right?
Not quite. There has been a trend, very 
evident in this current election process, in
which major party candidates brand any
one who votes outside of the Republican 
and Democratic parties as wasting their 
votes. And frighteningly, many people 
have started to agree. Who needs violent 
coercion when one can simply con
vince potential voters that there is 
only one  I mean ... that there 
are only two acceptable choices?
The only way to waste ones vote is 
to vote against ones conscience.
The fact is the United States of 
America was founded as a democra
cy, not a duopoly. The Democratic 
and Republican parties are not enti
tled to any votes. When this country 
was first founded, it was done so 
without official parties. When the 
major parties did finally come, they 
werent Democratic and Republican, 
but Federalist and anti-Federalist. 
American politics has seen numer
ous parties rise and fall by the will of 
the people. Now, the two parties are 
trying to control and subvert the will 
of the people to maintain their own power.
Just look at the Commission on 
Presidential Debates (CPD), a private com
pany founded by the Democratic and 
Republican parties to control the presiden
tial debates. For the current election year, 
the CPD raised the bar to qualify for the pres
idential debates to poll at 15% or above in 
several national polls, up from 5% in the 
1996 election. This barred all third party 
candidates from the debate, and the conse
quences are evident. Throughout the first
Gabriel Sabourin/Art Staff
two presidential debates, the candidates 
have seemed to agree more than disagree.
The polls themselves are flawed since they 
use a likely voter turnout probability to 
weigh the responses of those polled. That 
means that a college students opinion is gen
erally given less weight than a forty-year-old
lawyer. One person, one vote, does not 
hold for these polls and if there is an unex
pectedly higher voter turnout of a certain 
demographics, these polls become mean
ingless. In the Minnesota Gubernatorial 
election of 1998, the polls misread 
the number of votes Jesse Ventura 
received by 15%!
There is the feeling, pervasive on 
campus, that a vote for Green Party 
presidential candidate Ralph Nader is 
a vote for Republican Party candidate 
George Bush because it siphons away 
votes from Democratic candidate A1 
Gore. No, a vote for Nader is a vote for 
Nader. To put it in greater perspec
tive, your individual vote will not 
change the result of the election. 
Statistically, your vote for Nader will 
not cause AI Gore to lose the election 
to Bush, nor will your vote for Pat 
Buchanan cause Bush to lose to Gore. 
Your vote, in the grand scheme of 
things, is a way of making your voice 
be heard, nothing more.
So let it be your voice. Vote your 
conscience, whatever that may be, and help 
restore our democracy.

Nonexistent letters could have changed campus for the better
But, seriously...
By: Sean Mintus
As one of the eleven people that read The 
Tartan, something has recendy come to my 
attention. The letters to the editor are just 
plain bad. Aside from the occasional whiny 
response to one of my columns, or the resi
dent band of philosophers offended by a bikini-clad supermodel, the letters to the editor 
arent really much of a read.
But, seriously, I got to thinking, and fig
ured that there must have been more letters 
submitted over the years than The Tartan has 
chosen to run. After all, I write roughly 150 
columns a week and they only run one. So I 
broke into the office late one night, dug 
through all of the files, and came up with 
these, the letters to the editor that just didnt 
make the cut.

Construction of the new College of Fine 
Arts has recently been completed. The 
University, as you might have noticed, has 
chosen to use the leftover dirt to fill in the 
ravine running through the middle of cam
pus. In hopes of creating a convenient place 
for students to meet, a small section of fence 
has been erected in the middle of the new
field, henceforth to be known as the Cut. 
Unfortunately, the student body has 
expressed disinterest with the fence. 
Therefore, Facilities Management Services 
will tear it down sometime within the next 
week. We do not anticipate that this will be 
any sort of eyesore or inconvenience to the 
student body, given the expediency and pre
cision with which FMS completes any task 
put before them.

The Board of Trustees recently approved 
the construction of a new student dormitory 
to be located on Margaret Morrison Street 
adjacent to Margaret Morrison Womens 
College. We hope that this new structure, to 
be named Donner House, will prove to be a 
well-placed and attractive addition to the 
campus.

Last week, a small chemical leak was 
discovered in Doherty Hall. The agent, 
acetiphinocalcetiphanophenacyllic acid, is 
considered extremely hazardous and has a 
half-life of roughly four thousand years. 
Side effects may include severe lethargy,
diminishing of any and all social skills, and 
dread at the thought of having to interact 
with anything that does not possess a 
modem. We ask that all students stay clear 
of Doherty Hall for at least a week. 
Facilities Management will handle the 
cleanup and sterilization.

Due to budget constraints, the food served 
in Highlander will be replaced by camel dung 
at weeks end. It will look and smell the 
same, but have absolutely no nutritional 
value, and in fact, will make anyone who eats 
it quite sick. Meal plan rates will be raised as 
well, to compensate for... well, something. If 
there are any student objections to this, 
please voice them now. If we hear nothing, 
the plan will go on as scheduled.

The University has set aside approxi
mately $100,000 for four student scholar
ships. There are no requirements for these 
funds, so they will be distributed on a 
first-come first-serve basis. To apply, sim
ply go to Warner Hall and knock on 
President Cohons door. Whisper the 
secret password: frivolous expenditure, 
and a small paper bag full of unmarked 
twenty-dollar bills will be left under your 
pillow by the asinine appropriations fairy. 
Should no students express interest in 
these assets, they will be placed back into 
the general university account and uti
lized for the construction of additional 
unneeded lawn-slaying tents, miniscule 
occupancy hillside amphitheaters, and 
large illuminated toilet paper tubes 
recounting the last one hundred years of 
Carnegie Mellons grossly uninteresting 
history.

Fugitive Apprehension Act endangers Fourth Amendment rights
FUGITIVE, from page A6 
records without ,using a grand jury.
The draconian bill before the 
House of Representatives is called 
the Fugitive Apprehension Act of 
2000. Already passed by the 
Senate, it provides money and pro
cedures to permit federal and local 
officials to work together to appre
hend fugitives. The concept sounds 
noble on the surface: Lets enable 
law enforcement to quickly nab 
convicted felons and accused sus
pects before they can get out of our 
jurisdiction. Lets help them quick
ly obtain information that will help 
them locate fugitives before they 
can commit any more crimes.
Never mind, of course, if any
body elses rights are trampled in 
the process. Several parts of the bill 
would grant the Attorney General 
broad powers to both subpoena 
information and suppress knowl
edge of the subpoena. In short, law
enforcement authorities would 
have the right to examine personal 
details about anyone even remotely 
connected to the fugitive without 
that persons knowledge.
This Constitutional run-around 
is achieved through an adminis
trative subpoena. According to the 
bill, the Attorney General may 
subpoena witnesses for the pur
pose of the production of any 
records ... that the Attorney 
General finds, based on articulable 
facts, are relevant to discerning the 
whereabouts of the fugitive. In 
short, you can be ordered to pro
duce information without the 
Attorney General or any law 
enforcement agency having' to 
' bring you or the information before 
a grand jury. If the police want 
something, they can get it, relevant 
or not.
Now, due to existing regulations, 
many government agencies have
power of administrative subpoe
nas. This arrangement greatly 
speeds things up and prevents the 
judicial system from becoming 
even more backlogged. However, in 
this situation, Congress is blatantly 
sidestepping the Constitution. 
Fourth Amendment rights are not 
subject to administrative inter
pretation or control.
Even more offensive is the fact 
that if the police want electronic 
information such as email or finan
cial information, they can obtain it 
without your knowledge. The 
Attorney General can delay notice 
of the subpoena and apply to a 
court to delay notice by your access 
provider or financial institution. 
So, when the US Marshals copy 
files from your email and bank 
accounts, they do not have to 
inform you of what theyre doing, 
and they can gag your ISP and bank 
from telling you.
This stealth subpoena also vio
lates your rights and contradicts 
the bill itself. Anytime you are sub
poenaed, you can contest it. You 
could, claim that information is 
privileged, that producing informa
tion is an unreasonable request, 
and so forth. How can one possibly 
petition the court to quash a sub
poena when one doesnt know 
about it? The bill itself provides for 
witnesses to contest the subpoena, 
yet it conveniently exempts elec
tronic and financial aspects via the 
delayed notice clause.
I can understand the desire to 
move quickly and obtain informa
tion that couid help apprehend 
someone for prosecution and/or 
prevent more crimes from being 
committed. However, law enforce
ment agencies must abide by a 
certain set of rules that protect 
everyone. Developing secret 
police powers is hardly the
answer. A better solution would 
be to establish an on-call grand 
jury specifically tasked to deal 
with fugitive issues. The $40 mil
lion the bill authorizes could then 
be spent on communication infra
structure to allow law enforce
ment agents- anywhere in the US 
to quickly link up with the grand 
jury. They could still obtain a 
great deal of information since 
grand juries can subpoena just 
about anybody for anything, but 
at least we wouldnt have police 
reading our email from the 
Engelbert Humperdink Fan 
Club distribution list while 
cousin Joey robs a convenience 
store in Boise, Idaho.

Sports ShortsTartans defeat Franciscan twice
The Carnegie Mellon baseball 
team played another doublehead
er against Franciscan University on 
Saturday. This time, the Tartans 
were sure to take both games in 
convincing fashion, winning 13-3 
in the first game and 13-6 in the 
second.
Graduate student Jay 
McCormack started the first game 
and went five strong innings. 
Sophomore Dan Bogard came on 
in relief and pitched the final 
inning; the game lasted only six 
innings because of the 10-run rule. 
The defense played well in the 
game, according to coach.Rich 
Greiser, completing two  double 
plays and holding Franciscan to 
only three runs.
Key offensive performances 
included Raf Taverns 3-3, with 3 
RBI and junior Nick Naviglias 3-4, 
with 2 RBI.
In the final game, the Tartans 
started first-year Charlie 
Hamilton, who went three innings. 
Bogard relieved again, and fin
ished the remainder of the game. 
Taveras again had a strong game, 
going 2-3 with 3 RBI. Catchers 
Scott Page and Eric Parent were 
2-4 and 3-4, respectively, and 
both had 2 RBI each.
The doubleheader marked the 
end of the fall season. Coach Rich 
Greiser is looking forward to the 
. spring season, when the team gets 
an added boost with the addition 
of several players who are current
ly involved in other sports at.
Greiser likes the intensity the 
team brings to practice and games, 
and says that the defense,'particu
larly the infield, has been sharp. 
Overall, he thinks the team is 
looking real strong.
Cross country defeats Geneva
onds.
The cross country teams will 
participate in the UAA meet, which 
will be hosted by Case Western 
Reserve on Saturday, October 28.
Ice hockey team holds exhibition
On Saturday night the Carnegie 
Mellon ice hockey team hosted the 
University of Pittsburgh for an 
exhibition game at Neville Ice 
Arena in the South Side. The 
Tartans did not know what to 
expect going into the game, as it 
had been four years since the last 
match-up between these clubs. 
Regardless, since Pitt has a 30,000- 
plus student body from which to 
draw talent, in addition to finan
cial school sponsorship, the 
Tartans knew they were in for a 
challenge.
Pitt dominated the first five min
utes, racking up two even-strength 
goals. However,, at the halfway 
mark of the period, CMU experi
enced an offensive charge and cap
italized on it with a goal from 
sophomore Rob Ready, last sea
sons scoring leader. The goal was 
assisted by Jamie Bretz and Paul 
Shatlock.
Despite solid play by CMU, 
including strong checks and speed, 
Pitt was in charge of the scoring, 
adding three more goals by the 
end of the game. CMU was able to 
break its streak once at 12:36 of 
the third period when fifth-year 
senior P.J. Gryzwacz scored with 
an assist from Ready.
Carnegie Mellon is just begin
ning the season with a new roster 
of talent. Within its own league, 
this team has the potential to excel 
this year.
The next home game is on 
Saturday, October 28 at 6 pm in 
Neville Ice Arena against 
Youngstown.
Womens soccer
tough win over the Washington 
and Lee Generals, ending a sixgame losing streak.
The Tartans dominated the 
game, which they won 1-0, creat
ing many scoring opportunities for 
themselves while playing a solid 
defensive game at the same time.
Everything fell into place over 
the course of the 90-minute con
test, as the Tartans worked to score 
when given the opportunity.
As a result, they played one of 
their most proficient offensive 
games of the season. The Tartans 
had 15 shots with nine corners, 
which the Generals could not 
match.
Coach Heather Kendra said, We 
put a lot of quality shots on frame, 
and created some dangerous 
chances on corners.
The climax of the day came 
when first-year Lauren Taylor 
scored the only goal of the game 
for the Tartans. The crowd burst 
into applause and the players on 
the bench jumped to their feet. 
The goal was assisted by another 
first-year player, Erica Anderson.
Maya Nigrosh, the sophomore 
goalkeeper, earned a shutout, the 
Tartans fourth of the year.
The Generals were unable to 
score mostly because of the strong 
Tartan defense, which has only 
gotten better over the course of the 
season.
Coach Kendra said, I am very 
happy with the final result.. We 
played consistently hard for the 
entire 90 minutes. The defense 
came up huge the one time we lost 
our composure.
The Tartans (4-9) will play at 
Brandeis and at Rochester on
Friday and Sunday this week. 
Their next home game is against 
Case Western Reserve University 
during Parents Weekend, on 
Saturday, October 28.
The Tartans next home game 
will be this Tuesday night, at 7:30. 
They will be playing St. Vincent 
College.
Mens soccer now with 9-1 record
Tartan soccer has been domi
nant over the past several weeks, 
and improved its record with a 2-0 
win over St. Vincent last Friday.
The game was scoreless until 
about ten minutes into the second 
period, when sophomore Adam 
Hibshman broke towards the St. 
Vincent goal.
Hibshman was trailed by a St. 
Vincent defender, who, in an 
attempt to clear the ball, shot the 
ball over his own goalies head and 
scored for the Tartans from over 30 
yards out.
Sophomore Matt Crummy 
scored off of a cross through the 
box with'less than a minute to go, 
making the final score 2-0.
The Tartans play two important 
UAA games this week, at Brandeis 
on Friday, and then at Rochester 
on Sunday.
The Tartans hope to play well, in 
hopes of winning their conference 
and gaining a berth in the national 
NCAA tournament at the end of 
the season.

Roberts Wesleyan proved to be a 
tougher opponent than head 
womens volleyball coach Julie 
Webb had predicted. The Tartans 
faced them in the finals of this past 
weekends meet, which also fea

a 3-1 loss and another bout of dis

shown has made Webb want more 
than she expected, despite the 
respectable 19-9 record the 
Tartans now sport.
I didnt really have any expecta
tions at all, said Webb, regarding 
her preseason perspective. Were 
playing some of th best volleyball 
weve ever played.
Of the few factors that have 
been holding back this precocious 
team, the most important seems to 
be inexperience. Webb feels that 
team confidence, which comes 
from experience, sometimes lacks 
and can lead to instances where 
the team doesnt come through in
tight situations.
When the team wins, however, iti 
does so in bold fashion, led by! 
some crucial players in setter Amy 
Bergvall, outside hitter Jeri Goede,; 
middle hitter Sara Lechleitner, and 
outside hitter Lauren Schmidt. 
Lechleitner, who last week was 
named the UAA Player of the 
Week, recorded 21 kills against 
Case Western Reserve and 19 kills; 
against Washington at the second; 
UAA round-robin, with an overall; 
.495 hitting percentage.
It was a well-deserved honon 
for her, said Webb. Shes really* 
come on strong this year.
Webb was honored by her team! 
as well, having chalked up her 
100th career collegiate coaching 
victory with a win over Chatham 
College this past Thursday. The 
team is now about business, and 
looks towards two weeks from 
now, when the UAA tournament 
will be held.
Webb has confidence that the 
Tartans can perform well at the 
UAAs, which will take place at? 
Emory University on Saturday and' 
Sunday, October 28-29.
We really have a good shot at 
winning, said Webb. If we pl^g 
like I know we can play, we will 
win.

BASEBALL, from page A12 
an almost invisible ERA of 1.74 and 
Wells was a 20-game winner, I 
have to go with the Big Unit. 
Johnson had better numbers than 
Wells in every category except 
walks and wins (where he finished 
just short with 19) and was the 
leagues runaway leader in strike
outs. Of the three, Johnson also 
threw the most innings and bene
fited from the least run support 
(3.77 runs/game versus 3.93 for 
Martinez and 4.54 for Wells). 
Arizonas late-season collapse 
spoiled Johnsons chance at 20 
wins and inflated his ERA a bit; 
otherwise, he could have led in 
every single category.Best overall performance: Carlos 
Delgado may not have won the 
Triple Crown and probably wont 
get the MVP either since his team 
didnt make the playoffs, but he 
had one of the most productive 
offensive seasons of all time. 
Delgado ranked in the top seven in 
the American league in every 
offensive category except triples; 
he was fourth in batting average
(.344), fourth in home runs (41), 
fourth in RBIs (137), first in dou
bles (57), second in slugging per
centage (.664), second in on base 
percentage (.470), second in walks 
(123), sixth in hits (196), and sev

just three games above .500 on the 
road. If they had played as well 
away from Pac Bell Park as they 
had inside it, they could have (the
oretically) had 110 wins. Again, a 
first-round collapse reinforces the 
difficulty of putting it all together.Best trade acquisitions: I dont

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 16, 2000Hey, Iverson! Jewelz is for fools
IVERSON, from page A12 
Come to me with those fag ten
dencies and youll be sleeping with 
the maggots be. (Im not sure 
exactly what that means, but I dont 
think its positive.)
The NBA, I am sure, does not 
want to promote this type of mater
ial. Being a private organization, 
the league has every right to ban, 
suspend, or fine Iverson for his 
work (as demonstrated by the 
Supreme Courts ruling supporting 
the Boy Scouts ban on homosexual 
leaders).
Instead, Stern released the offi
cial NBA position as being that the 
league supports the players use of 
artistic license. I would be willing 
to bet that the NBA wouldnt extend 
a similar license to someone 
expressing Rockers viewpoint, but 
that is not the matter of contention 
here.
The problem is that the league 
lost a great opportunity to show 
that it is in control of its image and 
the message it wants to promote to 
children. Iverson could compose 
another album composed of noth
ing but exhortations for kids not to 
listen to his first, with a guest spot 
by Stern saying Iversons viewpoint 
is not the same as that of the league, 
but by not disciplining him other 
than recommending a change ill 
lyrics, this would not be very con
vincing.
Athletes are role models, no mat
ter what Charles Barkley says. Allen 
Iverson could serve as a great exam
ple to kids growing up in economi
cally depressed, drug-ridden, and 
high violence areas similar to his 
childhood home.
Instead, he chooses to reinforce 
every stereotype about them not 
only to outsiders, but to the kids 
growing up in that situation them
selves. Rather than telling them 
that they can make it out, that there 
is an opportunity for them to suc
ceed, and that there are other possi
ble career avenues for those not 
blessed with 40 inch verticals and 
lightning quickness, he says that: 
Life goes on, ns dont live that 
long.
It is not necessarily Iversons 
responsibility to be a civil rights 
leader, but it is disappointing that 
he has chosen to use his high visi
bility and influence in a negative' 
way.
At this point, most people say 
What about the First 
Amendment? Sure, Iverson has 
freedom of speech, and he can say 
whatever he wants without fear of 
criminal prosecution.
However, as I mentioned before, 
the NBA is a private organization. 
While Iverson has the right to free 
speech, he does not necessarily 
have the right to be an employee of 
the NBA and the Philadelphia 
76ers.
I am all for free speech. Being 
somewhat of a journalist, I appreci
ate the right to express my views. I 
am sure that Allen Iverson had a 
very difficult childhood, and that 
the things he is rapping about on his 
CD are the reality that he experiMatt Blum/Art Staff
enced growing up. And I am all for 
him expressing his experiences.
However, if I were David Stem, I 
would tell Iverson to decide 
between balling and rapping. The 
NBA has long strived to make a pos
itive impact on underprivileged 
youth, and Iversons CD is going 
against this ideal. And, judging 
from others such as Shaquille 
ONeal and Master P, rap and bas
ketball dont mix too well.
Lets see if Jewelz can make it in 
the rap world without the help of 
being known as a professional bas
ketball star. Faced with this deci
sion, Iverson would be smart to for
get about music and concentrate on 
helping his team win a champi
onship.

by Pete Patterson
Apparently, John Rocker had it 
all wrong. He merely spouted out 
his anti-PC views to the wrong 
source, Sports Illustrated writer Jeff 
Pearlman. All he needed to do was 
hire a record label, put a fiddle, 
drums, and a guitar behind him, 
and imitate one of his favorite 
country singers. For then, he 
would have avoided much of the

sioner Bud Selig. According to 
David Sterns logic, anyway.
Stem, commissioner of the NBA, 
this weekend released a long state
ment speaking against Allen 
Iversons lyrics on his new rap CD, 
but in the end did not do anything 
to discipline the Philadelphia 76ers 
star. Iversons album is no touchyfeely, Shaq-Fu-esque kids rhyme 
either, but more along the lines of 
Jay-Z, DMX, or Mobb Deep. In 
other words, he makes Rocker look 
like Pittsburgh native Mr. Rogers. 
So what is Iversons truth 
expressed, as Jewelz on the album

He is apparently not too fond of

Miscues doom Tartans in St. Louis, suffer 20-3 loss
by Charles Martin
Junior Staffwriter
The Tartan football squad traveled to St. 
Louis this past weekend to do battle with its 
bitter rivals, the Washington University 
Bears, looking to gain control of the confer
ence race in the UAA. The Tartans also want
ed to exact some measure of revenge for last 
years 24-7 defeat by ruining Wash Us home
coming. Those aspirations vanished in a 
cloud of untimely errors as CMU (4-2, 1-1) 
fell to the Bears (4-3, 2-0), 20-3, on 
Saturday night.
The game was not nearly as lopsided as the 
score indicated. The young Tartans played 
extremely hard, battling the Bears on every 
play. This, despite playing most of the game 
without starting quarterback and one of the 
top offensive playmakers, Eric Zimpfer.
Zimpfer was lost for the game late in the 
first quarter after he sustained a shoulder 
injury. In his absence, sophomore Michael 
Wykosky turned in a gritty performance, 
completing eight passes on twelve attempts 
for 69 yards.
CMU was able to effectively run the foot
ball against the aggressive Washington 
defense. The Bear defense came into the 
game ranked 13th nationally against the run, 
allowing only 62 yards per contest and a 
mere 1.8 yards per carry. The week before, 
Washington had held national powerhouse, 
third-ranked Trinity College (TX), to a mere 
30 yards on the ground in a last second 
18-17 defeat. Keyed by the tough blocking of 
the Tartan offensive line and the lightning
quick combination of Andrew Garrod (11 
carries, 57 yards) and Ricardo Clarke (8-40), 
CMU was able to grind out 142 total yards. 
The ground attack enabled the Tartans to 
hold the ball for 33 minutes and tallied 14 
first downs.
For its part, the CMU Red Dog defense 
played well, much better than its lackluster, 
mistake-ridden outings against Alfred and 
Franklin and Marshall. The Tartans were 
strengthened by the return of co-captain 
inside linebacker Nick Zitelli, who led the 
Tartans with 13 total tackles.
The beleaguered CMU secondary, which 
had surrendered back-to-back 300-yard pass
ing days, featured a new look. Junior comerback Jason Morris returned from injury and 
safeties Joe Manger and Jacob Nichols start
ed in place of senior incumbents Matt 
Noretto and Jarod Winchester. Manger was 
credited with nine tackles in his first start. 
The Tartans held the Bears to only 10 points 
through the first three quarters of the game.
The Tartans as a whole tackled much better 
and did not giye allow Wash U to execute the 
big play. On both sides of the ball, CMU fought 
to stay in the game and created opportunities 
to win. Yet, the Tartans were never able to 
fully take advantage of their hard work.
The Tartans were done in by their own mis
takes. There were several key breakdowns in 
critical moments for the CMU squad. The 
first important miscue happened after the 
Tartans were forced to punt on the first drive 
of the game. Senior Matt Young boomed a 
42-yard punt to the Washington 21-yard line. 
However, the punt coverage team failed to 
tackle and Washingtons first-year returner
Blake Westra was able to weave his way for a 
32-yard gain, giving the Bears excellent 
starting position at the Tartan 48-yard line. 
The Bears quickly took advantage of the scor
ing opportunity.
Using a series of short, quick passes bal
anced with outside runs; Washington 
methodically drove down to the Tartan fouryard line. Fullback Mike Henrichs blasted 
over left guard to give the Bears a 7-0 lead. 
The Tartans went down 10-0 after another 
short Wash U drive culminated with a 
Johnathan Feig 32-yard field goal. The 
Tartans were able to seize some momentum 
on Mike Palmers 32-yard field-goal boot 
with five seconds left in the first half.
Trailing 10-3 to start the second half, the 
CMU defense stepped up and forced 
Washington to punt on its first drive. The 
Tartan offense promptly began to drive the 
ball. Starting at its 15 and traveling all they 
way to the Washington 43, CMU faced a third 
and eight when disaster struck. Normally 
reliable, center Robert Bartons shotgun snap 
sailed over Wykoskys head. Wykosky man
aged to recover the fumble but not before a 
loss of 18 yards, mining CMUs best drive of 
the day. The Tartan offense wasnt quite the 
same after that, only gaining a net total of 15 
yards on 18 plays.
The botched snap was clearly the turning 
point of the game. However, the next Tartan 
miscue was the most costly. For the second 
time in as many years, the Bears were suc
cessful in blocking a Matt Young punt. Wash 
U linebacker Brad Loomis led a Bear jailbreak 
and blocked the kick, setting Washington up 
at the Tartan 25-yard line. The Tartan
defense was able to keep Washington out of 
the endzone, but the damage was done. 
Feigs second field goal gave the Bears a 13-3 
lead with a little over 7:30 left in the game.
With the way the Washington defense was 
playing, the lead was all but secure, the Bears 
added a late touchdown to pad its victory 
margin with 1:11 left in the game. The win 
was the first home victory against CMU since j 
1994.
The pivotal factor in the game was field 
position, which Washington had a decided 
edge in. The average starting position for 
Wash U was its own 43 while CMU averaged 
starting at its own 22. All of the Bears scor
ing drives began in Tartan territory.
Despite this disadvantage, the Tartans 
played with a lot of heart. However, the ten- ' 
dency of CMU to make critical mistakes at 
inopportune times, combined with the inabil- ' 
ity to create big plays on defense (zero 
turnovers forced, zero sacks) and special 
teams (longest kickoff return 16 yards, no 
punt returns) was just too much to overcome.
The Tartans dont have much time to wallow 
in defeat. They face another stem challenge * I

of Chicago (5-1) brings its fourth-ranked ,

by Preston Treichel
Junior Staffwriter
On October 6, the Carnegie Mellon mens 
tennis team arrived at Washington and Lee 
University with high hopes. It participated in 
the annual fall Division III Southeast Mens 
Regional Tournament, the main event in 
terms of fall tennis. There are eight regional 
tournaments across the country and the win
ners of them meet in Memphis for nationals 
starting on October 19.
Carnegie Mellon sent four singles partici
pants and two doubles teams to the tourna
ment of 19 teams at Washington and Lee. 
The results were very positive, with sopho
more Kayvon Fatahalian prevailing in sin
gles, and Fatahalian and sophomore Jon Hui 
winning the doubles draw.
CMUs number one singles player and
2000 Division III National champion, Kayvon 
Fatahalian, was the favorite heading into the 
tournament. After winning the Division III 
title last season, Fatahalian was the obvious 
number one seed in singles competition. 
There we^e high expectations, and 
Fatahalian did not fail to meet them.
Kayvon played very well, said head 
coach Peter Moss. He stumbled in the semi
finals against Waheeb and dropped a set, but 
he was well prepared for finals. That set 
against Tuomas Waheeb of Averett College 
proved to be the only set that Fatahalian lost 
all tournament.
I was happy with my performance, 
Fatahalian said. Considering my prepara
tion coming into the tournament, I felt like I 
played okay. His domination was not only 
in the singles competition, however.
After sweeping the field in singles, 
Fatahalian also contributed to his and Huis 
doubles victory. They breezed through the 
competition, even defeating the team that 
beat them last year at Memphis. They 
smoked them in the finals, 6-3, 6-2. But 
Fatahalian credits Hui for playing extremely 
well.
Jon played really well. I basically just sat 
around and watched him do everything, 
said Fatahalian.
But overall, the main reason Fatahalian 
and Hui beat their opponents this year was 
because Hui simply played at his highest 
level.
Jon played some of the best tennis I have 
seen out of him yet, coach Moss said. He 
was especially returning serves well.
Fatahalian and Hui are currently prepar
ing for nationals in Memphis. The winners
from the eight regional tournaments around 
the country in Division III will go head to 
head in fierce competition. To add to the 
pressure, Fatahalian is expected to win this 
one, too.
On paper, Im supposed to win, but there 
are always plenty of players that can beat you 
if youre not prepared, Fatahalian said. Jon 
and I are trying to win it, but We also want to 
work on playing better.
The winner at Memphis then goes onto a 
four-representative tournament between 
the winners of the Division II, Division III, 
NAIA, and junior college tournaments. The 
winner of that eventually gets a bid to the 
division I fall tournament. Fatahalian isnt 
thinking about his chances for doing that, 
though.
Id just be happy with winning the 
Division III tournament, he said.
Enough predictions, try the year in review
A View From the Bleachers
by Matt Brun
Just when I thought I had hit rock 
bottom in my prediction abilities, 
that I had reached a point where 
things couldnt possibly get any 
worse, I only get two of the four 
divisional series right. Naturally, 
the teams I missed on were the two 
I had picked to go to the World 
Series. Its almost enough to make a 
guy swear off writing for good.
All is not lost, however. I can take 
some solace in the fact that Im no 
Nostradamus, and (most of the 
time) Im right just about as often as 
any so-called expert. Take Sports 
Illustrateds pre-season picks, for 
example. They had the hapless Red 
Sox going all the way to the title this 
year. If nothing else, I certainly was
nt nuts enough to make that pick.
Still, I think Id be much better 
served by not making any picks for 
the League Championship series, 
even though theyre already half 
over. Im pretty sure I could get the 
Yankees-Mariners outcome given 
that New York has a 3-1 lead and 
only need one more win, but once I 
get that one right, theres no way on 
Gods green earth Id be able to also 
pick the Cardinals-Mets winner 
after St. Louis dropped two at home 
only to come back and rout the Mets 
in New York to get back in the series.
I also dont feel like looking back 
on the division series to analyze 
what went wrong in my picks, so I 
thought Id go back to the regular 
season and hand out some superla
tives for individual performances. I 
will refrain from choosing Cy 
Young award winners or MVPs 
since those could be construed as 
predictions, but should you choose 
to interpret my Best Pitcher catego
ry in that fashion, I will not be held 
responsible for any money you lose 
betting on it.
Just to make this introductory 
section a little longer, I thought Id 
interject a random thought on the 
NFL season that Ive had to get off 
my chest: the St. Louis Rams are 
just plain scary. I dont know how
any defensive player, much less a 
defensive coordinator, that has to 
face them later in the season is get
ting any sleep, even if theyre play
ing in week 17. Everyone says that 
they cant continue to score 40 
points a game for the rest of the 
year, but whos going to stop them? 
Anyway, back to business.
Biggest surprise of the season 
(team): Chicago White Sox, no con
test. A case could be made that the 
Indians fall from grace was a bigger 
shock, but once they got the injury 
situation straightened out, they 
played some of the best ball of the 
season in August and September. 
The White Sox, though, came out of 
nowhere to claim the best record in 
the American League despite just a 
so-so second half. I think their firstround flame-out in the playoffs 
shows just how hard it is to main
tain that level of play.
Biggest surprise (player): Frank 
Thomas has a career year at age 32? 
I sure didnt see it coming, especial
ly after the Big Hurt limped to a 
mere 77 RBIs last year. The new 
millennium has certainly been good 
to Thomas, and a .328 average with 
43 homers and 143 RBIs is one hell 
of a year for anybody this side of the 
Hall of Fame.
Biggest bust (player): What hap
pened to Ken Griffey, Jr.? Looks like 
the pressure of performing for the
had a chance last year and couldnt 
take advantage, now well have to 
wait and see how long it takes to 
get another one.
Worst defense: This ones a tie 
between the entire San Diego 
Padres roster and Chuck 
Knoblauch. San Diego led
The White Sox came out of nowhere to 
claim the best record in the AL .... their 
first round flame-out shows how hard it 
is to maintain that level of play.
hometown team was a little too 
much. Hes too good not to settle 
down next year, but that talent 
shouldnt let him slump like this, 
either.
Biggest bust (team): Griffey was 
supposed to be the final piece of the 
picture in Cincinnati. He didnt 
come through, but the teams strug
gles were hardly all his fault. They
(trailed?) the league with 141 
errors on the year. Knoblauch got 
benched in the playoffs because he 
couldnt throw the ball to first base. 
The Padres may have set the stan
dard for ineptness this year, but it 
sure was funny watching 
Knoblauch hit that little old lady in 
the stands with a throw, wasnt it?
Best defense: The Indians infield.
Reagan Heller/Art Staff
All of you disregarding this pick as 
biased, I dare you to find a fault 
with it. As a team, Cleveland led the 
league with just 72 errors in 6,066 
chances (.988 fielding percentage). 
The infield combined for just 31 of 
those (Travis Fryman eight at third, 
Omar Vizquel three at short, 
Roberto Alomar 15 at second, Jim 
Thome five at first). Alomar also 
helped turn 109 double plays, 99 
with help from Vizquel.
Worst pitcher: Another tie. While 
baseball fans everywhere (perhaps 
even in Philly) wanted to see Phillies 
pitcher Omar Daal get 20 losses (he 
ended up with 19), we were also 
curious to see just how many home 
runs Houstons Jose Lima would 
give up. In 196.1 innings spanning 
33 starts, Lima surrendered 48 
dingers, an average of 1.45 per start 
or 2.2 per nine innings.
Best pitcher: This was a tough, 
three-man race between Pedro 
Martinez, David Wells, and Randy 
Johnson. While Martinez did have

Homecoming weekends Highland Festival will feature Scottish theme
World premiere, Appointment in 
Samarra, lands in Purnell Center
CMU Jazz Ensemble plays in honor of legendary composer Duke Ellington
t>y Andy Francis
Co-Arts and Living Editor
While Carnegie Mellon has 
been busy for the past year or so 
marking its 100th anniversary, 
the School of Music decided to 
celebrate the 100th birthday of 
legendary jazz composer Duke 
Ellington. Saturday night at 
Carnegie Music Hall, the CMU 
Giants of Jazz Ensemble and the 
concert choir presented an 
overview of Ellingtons work, 
ranging from quiet religious 
music to up-tempo, toe-tapping 
swing.
Early on in the show, Jazz 
Ensemble conductor Gary 
Fienberg explained that, given 
the prolific amount of music
composed by Ellington, it would 
be easy to put together a set list 
based on one particular style of 
jazz. Instead, the musicians 
decided to play songs that they 
thought would be the most fun 
for them as well as the audience. 
Some of the more popular selec
tions were "It Dont Mean a 
Thing if It Aint Got That Swing 
and Mood Indigo. In addition, 
mentioned Fienberg, the jazz 
ensemble and concert choir tried 
to incorporate a variety of 
arrangements, by contemporary 
composers, Concert Choir con
ductor Robert Page, and 
Ellington himself.
The concert opened up with 
five selections played by the jazz 
ensemble without the choir that 
ranked as probably the most
entertaining pieces of the 
evening. The band played a good 
variety of shades and styles, from 
the slow, laid-back groove of In 
a Mellow Tone to the bold, 
brassy It Dont Mean A Thing if 
It Aint Got That Swing. Holding 
each tune together was impres
sive work from the bassists, who 
laid down Ellingtons loping bass 
lines perfectly. The real treat of 
this set was Caravan, a percus
sion-heavy number that Fienberg 
said was meant to evokthe jungle 
atmosphere of 'Harlems Cotton 
Club. The song balanced the 
aggressive clang of Latin percus
sion with some impressive saxo
phone soloing, topping it off 
with a flourish of drums.
After these songs, the jazz

Each fall right around this time, Carnegie Mellon 
holds its Homecoming festivities to celebrate the 
people who went here and revisit the Universitys 
heritage. Well, the first 100 years of it anyway. As 
anyone who has heard the CMU bagpipers can tell 
you, the real roots of the school hark back to 
Scotland, homeland of Andrew Carnegie. In honor 
of this, the Tartan Appreciation Program and the 
Alumni Association are presenting the first annual 
Tartan Highland Festival this Saturday from 9 am to 4 pm on the Cut and the CFA lawn.
Throughout the day on Saturday, booths will be 
set up on the lawns with all sorts of societies, 
demonstrations, and vendors selling all things 
Scottish. Merchants coming to the festival will be 
selling a wide variety of souvenirs: Gaelic Imports
sheaf toss, the weight toss, and the more familiar 
caber toss. While this years games will primarily 
just be demonstrations, the festivals organizers 
hope to eventually expand it into a bigger competi
tion where campus organizations could enter con
testants and compete for prizes. Other events lined 
up include three troupes of Scottish dancing girls 
performing at various times in Kirr Commons and a 
performance by the Southminster Ringers, a group 
of bell-ringers from a Pittsburgh church.
While the inaugural Tartan Highland Festival has 
a fairly substantial schedule of events, those in 
charge of it hope to expand the festival into a more 
well known and anticipated yearly event. As 
Dietrich explains, the Tartan Appreciation Program 
is hoping to make the Tartan Highland Festival in 
the fall what Carnival is in the spring. In the 
future, organizers also plan to schedule the festival 
apart from mid-semester break to encourage as 
many students as possible to attend.

features traditional Scottish food like meat pies and 
sausage rolls, Sylvan Spirits has Scottish books and 
music for sale, and Camus International will have 
perhaps the most Scottish articles of all, kilts.
Other groups not peddling their wares will also 
have tables at the Highland Festival, including the 
St. Andrews Society of Pittsburgh, which aims to 
promote Scottish heritage. Megan Davidson, a 
writer of Gothic Romance novels, will hold a booksigning in the University Bookstore at 3 pm, and 
will have a booth set up outside the rest of the day 
where she will translate peoples names into Gaelic. 
In addition, eight different Scottish clans, both 
regional and national, will be represented on 
Saturday. Some will be bringing a list of names so 
festival attendees can see if they have any Scottish 
heritage. Finally, blacksmith Richard Clark and the 
Fiber Mavens, a groups of weavers and spinners, 
will be demonstrating their crafts throughout the 
day.
Although Homecoming will by itself provide a 
good deal for students and alumni to do, the Tartan 
Highland Festival has been planned to coincide 
with and increase interest in Homecoming. Senior 
Spanish major Season Dietrich, chair of the Tartan 
Appreciation Program, explains that the festival is 
a way for students to interact with the alumni since 
it takes place over Homecoming weekend. Indeed, 
several of the events are tied in with Homecoming, 
most notably the parade scheduled to arrive at 
Gesling Stadium right before the Homecoming 
football game at 2 pm. In addition, Andrew 
Carnegies great-granddaughters Margaret 
Thompson and Louise Suggett will be recognized at 
the game.
Probably the biggest draw for the Tartan 
Highland Festival will be the events scheduled for 
various times during the day. Notable among them 
is the Highland Games, scheduled to begin at 9 am.

This past Wednesday the first 
main show of the season opened 
on the stage of the Philip Chosky 
Theatre in the Purnell Center for 
the Arts.
This wasnt just any opening; it 
was the opening of the world pre
miere of a new play by Cindy 
McKay. The play is adapted from 
John OHaras novel Appointment 
In Samarra, which comments on 
the morals and manners of 
Americans. Directed by Anthony 
McKay, head of the acting and 
music theatre majors at Carnegie 
Mellon and husband of the play
wright, the audience is allowed to 
see the inner-workings of an elite 
society and learns that its whats 
on the inside that counts.
At the start, the gorgeous set, 
excellent jazz music, and beauti
ful costumes draw the audience 
into the world of the 1930s in a
small, fictional, coal town in east
ern Pennsylvania.
Justin Elker, a senior social and 
decision sciences major comment
ed, The costumes and especially 
the set were excellent. There is a 
live jazz band onstage and the 
actors performed the dances from 
the period. The audience is intro
duced to the characters at the 
Christmas Eve party of the elite 
club in Gibbsville, Pennsylvania.
The play follows Julian English, 
played by Lea Coco, one of the 
prominent leaders of the club, 
through the next couple days of 
his life while he struggles to break 
free from the very society whose 
rules govern his life. The audi
ence watches as he starts in the 
country club, journeys to a road
house, and ends up in a shanty
town. Meanwhile, Julian learns 
that hes not so different com
pared to those that he has always 
set himself apart from and he has 
to deal with this recognition ver
sus the pressures of his society.
The plot of the first act is a little 
slow, as the audience discovers all 
the details of the past seven years 
of this town, including how Julian 
got to where he is today, why he is 
so upset with his position in life, 
and how the other characters are 
related to him. However, the 
slow-moving plot of the first act is 
more than compensated for with 
the development of the charac
ters. Although none of the char
acters are especially likeable, 
from the mobster and narrator, A1 
Grecco, played by Braden Moran, 
to the hysterically funny member 
of the elite club and friend to 
Julian, Froggy Ogden, played by 
Jamie Iglehart, the actors were 
excellent.
I found few of the characters to 
be likeable, and I felt far removed 
from their ultra-high class society. 
But nonetheless, I found it 
strangely entertaining, feeling 
like an outsider peering into the 
extravagant but unappealing lives
See SAMARRA, page B2
Lea Coco, seen here on the far right, played Julian English in Appointment in Samarra. Sitting next to him is 
Caroline Craig, who plays his wife.
Maya Angelou discusses her work
sounded like a preacher, said 
Alicia Walker, a ten-year-old stu
dent from the Pittsburgh area. 
The audience received good 
advice. One point was that people 
can affect others in positive ways 
and not even know it. The mayor 
of Little Rock, Arkansas told 
Angelou in the 20s, Your uncle 
Willy gave me a job in [his] store, 
gave me ten cents a week, and 
made me love to learn. Angelou 
was astounded that she had never 
realized the affect her uncle had 
with others besides herself.
Angelou also encouraged peo
ple to be patient. The single ele
ment of character is patience. 
Angelou said that when people do 
not have patience with others 
from differing backgrounds, they 
dont understand where they are 
coming from. An example of this 
is with old people, who are fre
quently insulted. She added with 
a laugh,  I mean Im not talking 
about myself.
Angelou stressed that it is 
patience that makes a good poet. 
However this wasnt the first les
son on education that evening. It 
started with talks by the hosts 
themselves. They included Sister

of a shameful bunch, said 
Elker. Stephen Fletcher, as 
the Irishman Harry Reilly, 
and Lacey Bullard, as the 
Polish waitress, and ex-mis
tress of Julians, handle their 
difficult accents superbly. 
And Christi Craig, who plays 
Caroline English, Julians 
wife, steals the show when
ever she walks onstage.
The play is also extremely 
witty. Although it is clearly 
not a comedy, the audience 
laughed throughout the 
show. The humor, the char
acters, the music (including 
the talented voice of Ryan
Berkowitz as Helene 
Holman), and the second act 
make the play entertaining. 
The plot takes off in the sec
ond act since the audience 
has learned about the past 
seven years of Julians life 
and is now ready to see what 
he will do in the present. 
Pay attention because the 
ending is subtly foreshad
owed throughout Act I. The 
play had a thought-provok
ing message about class 
expectations that was 
revealed in the second act, 
commented Sarah Dence, a 
junior majoring in chemical 
engineering.
As college students living 
on a tight budget, you will all 
appreciate the shameful 
goings-on of this high-class 
society and the foolishness of 
its members. The play is def
initely worth seeing and you

nity yet. There are still per

JAZZ, from page B1
ensemble left the stage to make room 
for the concert choir, a change that 
brought a whole different flavor to the 
show. Supported by only a piano, bass, 
and drums, the choir sang Ellington 
tunes that showcased his moody, 
down-tempo side. Unfortunately, the 
Concert Choir was probably the least 
engaging portion of the concert; with 
the exception of Renu Parmars solo 
rendition of I Got It Bad and That 
Aint Good, the music was rather slow 
and church-like.
Following an intermission, both the 
jazz ensemble and the concert choir 
took the stage for the second half of 
the show. The combination of the two
was in a sense a juxtaposition, since a 
chorus of voices isnt generally associ
ated with swinging jazz. In fact, the 
choir remained silent for two of the 
five songs they were onstage for. 
Their best moment came in Mood 
Indigo, a melancholy number that 
featured Fienberg on trumpet. The 
Choir sounded almost like a synthe
sizer, lending a majestic air to the 
tune. The Choir and Ensemble also 
clicked on Im Beginning to See the 
Light, where jazzier singing comple
mented the energetic trumpet lines 
nicely.
To end the concert, the concert choir 
and jazz ensemble played selections 
from Ellingtons Sacred Concert, a 
work that Ellington described as The
most important thing Ive ever done/ 
This section of the show opened with a 
quiet religious number which was 
immediately followed by the spry song 
Aint But the One. The last number, 
Praise God and Dance, alternated 
solemn solo turns by soprano singed 
with rumbly drum-piano passages. It 
seemed like a disappointing way to 
end the show, until the Dance part of 
the song came out of nowhere at the 
end, accompanied by a group of 
flashily dressed dancers. The dancers 
bounded quickly to the front of the 
stage, adding a unique element to the 
performance and helping the jazz 
ensemble and concert choir put an 
exciting cap on a diverse, entertaining 
show.
Mr. and Mrs. English, played by Lea Coco and Chisti Craig, are prominent memebrs of the elite and

the obstacles that she over

shes a wonderful inspira
tion for our children and for

called Phenomenal

The audience learned 
about the inspiration for 
Angelous work. She recited 
Sympathy by one of her 
favorite poets Laurence 
Dunbar. It includes the line 
I know why the caged bird 
sings. These words were 
written a little over a hun
dred years ago but Angelou 
brought them back to the 
audiences attention. The 
audience roared when they
heard her recite the refrain, 
jump back honey, jump 
back, in another poem by 
Dunbar. She said, It could 
have been written last week 
for Queen Latifah.
Angelou wants us to 
believe that ideal success 
can happen within society. 
Children being well looked 
after, families becoming 
educated and their intelligece can become a reality, 
if we imagine it to be.
Angelou left a clear mes
sage for her listeners: Have 
courage throughout your 
life. Perhaps this can be best 
reflected in Angelous own 
life. "When Im gone from

arrest for the fashion police. This 
week I am going to direct com
ments to those seeking employ
ment.
Attention seniors: By this 
point in time, you should own a 
suit. A well-tailored, sophisticat
ed suit. Men: You need a power 
tie. Just because you can tie it 
around your neck does not mean 
that you can wear it to an inter
view. You may even want to have 
two of them. You also need wellkept, functional shoes. And for 
goodnesss sake, something pro
fessional to carry your resumes 
in. And if you have never paid for 
a haircut, its definitely time. But 
you must remember this one 
thing: please, please, please buy 
some sort of long coat for fall and 
winter interviews. -Imagine, if 
you will, how much less credible 
you are with a North Face that 
only partially covers your suit 
jacket.
I know what youre thinking. 
Job interviews are not beauty 
pageants. I know that merit and 
talent mean much more than 
physical appearance. But first
impressions do last a lifetime. In 
the very self-centered Carnegie 
Mellon world, it may be hard to 
imagine not being sought after 
for intelligence and ability. We 
take for granted that employers 
will overlook a fashion faux pas 
and see our inner beauty. If we 
were enrolled a little bit further 
down Forbes, we might not be so 
lucky.
These opinions reflect some of 
my fundamental complaints 
about apparel at this university. 
With the passing of the job fairs, 
and the onslaught of interviews 
and site visits in the near future, 
I feel it necessary to speak on the 
matter.
Once people are able to realize 
the fundamental aspects of 
dressing for success, we will dis
cuss dressing for every day. For 
example, I think Tevas and 
Birkenstocks are just as comfort
able as the next person, but 
wearing them with socks does 
not make them suitable snow 
boots.
By the way: there is a reason 
that credit card companies do 
not charge money for those free 
shirts. More on that to come 
next week.
Treat what I have said as if it 
were a classroom discussion. Re
read the material. Take notes if 
you must. Try to learn it and uti
lize your knowledge. And pre
tend each and every day is a fash
ion final exam.

50 YEARS AGO, October 17, 1950  Plans for homecoming 
neared their final stages. Three principal attractions for the years 
celebration were the freshman-sophomore competition, the dedica
tions of Morewood Gardens, and departmental open houses.
The class competition would consist of the Scottish game Fasterns 
Een, a game similar to slaughter ball. The outcome of the game 
would determine whether freshmen would need to cotinue wearing 
their dinks.
. Morewood Gardens was scheduled to be officially dedicated at in 
the first floor lounge of the womens dormitory during the weekend 
as Well.
Departmental open house tours were to be conducted by each 
departmental student society. The tours were scheduled to be short 
so that underclassmen could visit many departments.
25 YEARS AGO, October 14, 1975  Two former university 
employees filed a suit in Federal District court against CMU. They 
alleged that CMU discriminated against them on the basis of sex, as 
defined by Title VII of the civil rights act of 1964. The act deals with 
equal employment opportunity. It outlaws unfair employment prac
tices, .such as not hiring someone based on race, national origin, sex, 
or religion.
The women declined to comments on the specifics of the case until 
their lawyer could be reached. John E. Hackett, legal counsel for 
Carnegie Mellon denied the allegations in court.
The law stated that parties found in violation of the law may be
ordered to take affirmative action, such as rehiring employees, with 
or without back pay. A section of the act, however, seemed to exempt. 
the university from court action. It stated the act does not apply to 
an educational institution with respect to the employment of individ
uals to perform work connected with educational activities of such 
institution.
TEN YEARS AGO, October 22, 1990  Student Senate voted to 
hold a referendum regarding raising the Activities Fee to $50. The 
fee had previously been $40 per semester and had been distributed by 
Student Senate to many student organizations, such as WRCT, the 
Activities Board, and the crew team.
Senate said that if the motion failed, they would be forced to lower 
the amount of money distributed to student groups. Senate said that 
most student organization leaders were in favor of the change, 
understanding that more money was necessary to continue doing 
what they do.
A similar motion was brought up the previous year and voted down 
by the students. A number of students were against the fee raise 
because it had failed so recently. Student Government leaders, how
ever, said that they felt the increase didnt pass because students were 
not well informed about it.
FIVE YEARS AGO, October 23,1995  Pittsburgh Police and sev
eral pedestrians talked a potential suicide jumper out of jumping 
from the Forbes Avenue bridge over Panther Hollow. The University 
of Pittsburgh graduate student stepped onto the bridge railing at
approximately 4:30 pm. The man had stayed on the ledge of the 
bridge for over four hours until he was helped to safety. The man was 
given a cellular telephone at one point, although it was unclear who 
he had called.
The area was crowded with visitors that weekend for Pitts 
Homecoming and CMUs Parents Weekend. Traffic was allowed to 
pass through the bridge, but CMU police turned curious passersby 
away.
ONE YEAR AGO, October 18, 1999  Peter Stearns, Dean of the 
College of Humanities and Social Sciences, decided to resign from his 
position effective January 1, 2000. Stearns left the position to 
become provost at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA. As 
provost, Stearns would take on more responsibility and be in charge 
of the universitys academics and be in charge of the schools deans 
and directors.
Stearns said he left to pursue an interesting opportunity in an inter
esting place. He had been at CMU for 25 years. CMU provost Paul 
Christiano said that he would form a committee to select an interim 
Dean to take over the position in January. No permanent dean had 
been named yet. Stearns said the most important qualities in a suc
cessor were strong credentials as a scholar, tolerance for a variety of 
intellectual approaches, and active interest in the educational 
process.

Film Kitchen will present unique 
display of students and local artists
by Yang CaiJunior Staffwriter
This past week, two films and 
one video by local artists were pre
sented at the 23rd monthly screen
ing event of Pittsburghs Film 
Kitchen. The Film Kitchen is a 
unique gathering for local artists, 
students and visitors. After each 
presentation, audiences had 
chance to interact with the artists 
by asking questions and making 
comments.
Rich Fishkins video, Got Control?, presented his trip to 
Yugoslavia last year, which he 
made shortly after the cessation of 
NATO bombing there. The video 
was composed of field interviews 
and other documentary footage. Porodica, a 16-mm black and white 
film by Nancy Reed, is a portrait of 
the Yusubegovic family, a Bosnian 
family of mixed ethnic heritage 
who came to Pittsburgh in 1994 to 
escape the civil war in their home
land.Space Journey, a 16 mm color 
film by the William G. Beal Co., is a 
cheerful educational film co-produced by NASA and Kennywood 
that explains the physics laws 
behind the facilities of an amuse
ment park and space travel.
Both Got Control? and Porodica 
are about the war in Yugoslavia. 
The two artists who produced the 
films have different perspectives 
toward the subject. Fishkins view 
was from the Serbian perspective 
and politically opposed to the 
United States government. The 
theme of the movie was all lies, 
and employed facts and interviews 
to drive home this idea. Fishkins 
movie also used clips of political
demonstrations in the US and 
speeches by Serb officials.
On the other hand, Reeds movie 
was told from the perspective of a 
Bosnian family. She focused on 
the lives of individuals rather 
than political issues. At times, 
both artists perspectives were 
too traditional.
The films raise the question of 
what the unique stories are from 
that war. I would rather the 
artists have just focused one or 
two significant threads, for 
example, the bombing at the 
Chinese Embassy. Such an inci
dent would have been bizarre 
and ironic enough to make the 
point for Got Control? As Reed 
mentioned, people there were 
just killing each other, a situation 
that made young Serb-Albanian 
couples desperate. This perspec
tive could be unique to this war. 
Furthermore, it could be a great 
story; Readers Digest recently ran 
a true story about a SerbAlbanian couple who were killed 
during their escape.
Fishkins movie used rock music 
in conjunction with interviews 
and bloody scenes. The film gets 
into a rhythm of song-sceneinterview. The cycle is repeated 
over and over as the movie 
unfolds. However, in the end, the 
film turned out very boring and 
weak, although the interview 
about the bombing was unique.
Reeds movie is presented with 
a female voiceover throughout 
the movie. The visual compo
nents include slide shows of fam
ily photos and clips of war 
scenes. The gray effect and the 
smoke scenes are powerful, and 
the black and white images gave 
the feel that these events hap
pened decades ago. There was 
one remarkable highlight at the 
end:, When the narrator said, 
There are two kinds of scars: in 
body, and in heart. Coming from 
a country that has had lots of 
wars, I have seen lots of war 
movies. A few, like Catch 22 and Dr. Zhivago, are outstanding. 
Unfortunately, short movies 
dont have the same capacity as 
full-length features to tell the 
entire stories. In light of this, its 
essential for short movie makers 
to find unique angles or new 
metaphors, since they literally 
only have minutes to grab the 
viewers attention.
While the war movies were per
haps a bit too depressing, the 
third film, Space Travel, made the 
audience laugh from the begin
ning through the end. People 
laughed at things like the mock 
70s voiceover, the Pittsburgh aer
ial scene and other not-so-funny 
images. The crowd seemed to feel 
relaxed when they were able to 
view the world through kids per
spective. The theme of the movie 
is humorous. The flow of the 
movie is very fluent, from space 
to Kennywood. While both war 
movies are either political or doc
umentary, Space Travel is just a 
fun commercial promotion of 
Kennywood.
What makes a short film or 
video product a fine piece of art? 
It seems to me that it shouldnt be 
a documentary, a work of politi
cal propaganda, and it shouldnt 
sound like a textbook. In my 
opinion, these films are good in 
these respects, but due to their 
political and educational nature, 
I dont think they should really be 
considered art.

Zlingshot sponsors advice seminars for budding entrepreneurs
Compiled by

Personnel Manager
Under the motto From day one 
to IPO, all in one day, University 
zCAMP brought a host of 
Pittsburgh entrepeneurs to the 
University of Pittsburghs William 
Pitt Union this Saturday to offer 
their advice and stories to indepen
dent hopefuls.
Sponsored in part by Zlingshot, a 
Pittsburgh-based e-business accel
erator, the day offered a number 
of chances for participants to test 
the entrepreneurial waters. 
Between presentations, the entre
peneurs were available to hear 60- 
second elevator pitches, and 
potentially enter into more talks 
about business ideas.
Attendance was enough to fill 
the William Pitt Union ballroom, 
and official estimates said students 
accounted for 65 percent of the 
audience.
The ballroom sported a clear 
construction motif, with orange 
plastic mesh fence strung about, 
occasional flashing yellow con
struction lights, and bare lightbulbs 
in wire frames behind the stage.
The day began with an opening 
address by Mayor Tom Murphy, a 
long-time advocate for technological growth in Pittsburgh. He 
stressed the advantages of building 
business in Pittsburgh: here entre
preneurs can quickly become a big 
fish in a little pond. .
The infrastructure for a strong 
start-up economy has been laid in 
the past five years in the form of 
new trams, houses, and entertain
ment complexes, and the favorable 
economy is just now arriving. 100 
years ago, said Murphy, Pittsburgh 
was the Silicon Valley of the world 
and Mellon Bank was the original 
venture capitalist.
Later in the day a number of area 
CEOs participated in a panel dis
cussion entitled How Internet 
CEOs see todays market for star
tups. Present were Sanjay Chopra 
of OnlineChoice, Bill Guttman of 
printCafe, Astro Teller of 
BodyMedia, and Scott Sander of 
SightSound.com.
Each shared data about their ini
tial funding from venture capital
ists and angel investors, which 
ranged from $7.5 million for 
BodyMedia to $35 million for 
printCafe. In their beginnings, each 
company found partners in their 
industry who would benefit from 
their presence. For instance, 
OnlineChoice found support from 
home stores and BodyMedia from 
personal health companies.

Zlingshot, a local company dedicated to bringing entrepreneurial ideas to 
fruitation, held their second zCAMP Saturday at Pitt's Student Union. The 
event brought together the areas brightest minds to discuss startup issues.
Teller suggested that recipients 
of venture capital keep their spon
sors abreast of the companys 
progress, providing them with 
milestones after receiving series A 
funding. Investors will be more cer
tain of their investments and some
times more encouraged to provide 
further funding in later stages.
Logically, networking plays an 
even more important role for entre
preneurs, said Sander, who benefit-' 
ted from contact with CEOs of com
panies like HBO and movie studios. 
Having these people on an advisory
board can be a key to success, said 
Sander.
Employee attrition  a difficult 
topic in the start-up field  can be 
held at a minimum if the CEO sees 
himself as a psychologist. 
Emotional intelligence, he says, 
will bring a person and a company 
further than raw intelligence. I 
would rather have three emotional
ly intelligent people in my company 
than 30 Nobel laureates. In fact, 
the 30 Nobel laureates wouldnt 
last five minutes together.

US and world markets rise
NEW YORK CAP) - Stocks rebound
ed Friday from a selloff the day before 
as bargain-hunting investors helped 
push the Nasdaq composite index up 
more than 240 points, one of its best 
one-day performances ever.
The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed up 157.60 at 10,192.18, a 
marked contrast to its 379-point 
plunge on Thursday - its fifth-worst 
day ever in terms of point declines.
Broader stock indicators were also 
higher. The Standard & Poor's 500

On Thursday, stocks plunged over

Innovation Works provides seed 
capital for regional startups
by Vivek Sridharan
Junior Staffwriter
Apparently someone heard the 
complaints about Pittsburgh's lack 
of industry. Innovation Works, 
whose self-proclaimed mission is to 
increase the new-enterprise suc
cess rate in southwestern 
Pennsylvania, is a non-profit, community-funded investment organi
zation that allocates grants to help 
local start-up companies develop 
products for high-growth markets.
Innovation Works came about 
when the Ben Franklin Technology 
Center of Western Pennsylvania 
merged with the Enterprise 
Corporation. Unlike its predeces
sors, however, Innovation Works 
focuses on companies with less 
than 100 employees in fields rang
ing from biotechnology to robotics 
to information technology. In addi
tion, rather than just giving away 
money to the companies, they fund 
specific projects with great poten
tial in industry.
The next step would be growth of 
the company and more high-tech 
jobs available in Pittsburgh and sur
rounding areas.
In their latest round of funding, 
Innovation Works provided six 
Pittsburgh companies with nearly a
million dollars. Among the compa
nies funded were Bonecraft LLC 
(for a computer assisted orthopedic 
surgery system for osteotomies), 
Probotics, Inc. (for the commercial- I 
ization of a in-office mailman j 
robot) and PangGo Networks.
Four out of the five employees at 
PanGo are CMU graduates. The 
infant company is developing the i 
Proximity Platform. The system uti
lizes short-range wireless communi- ! 
cations for mobile commerce and ' 
content delivery among other plans, j
The majority of the money for the ! 
entrepreneurship grants comes j 
from the Pennsylvania Department  
of Community and Economic j 
Development. In addition to the ! 
grants, Innovation Works creates 
profiles for small local companies 
so investors and venture capitalists j 
can take a look at them and invest I 
in their growth.
Innovation Works has been con- : 
nected with Carnegie Mellon and 
other local universities from its 
inception. The consortiums origi- : 
nal business plan was developed 
with the help of CMU, the 
Pittsburgh Technology Council, 
and many other local organizations 
that have a vested interest in the 
economic growth of the Western 
Pennsylvania region.
Chevron nearing 
Texaco buyout
NEW YORK (AP) - Chevron 
Corp., the third-largest U.S. oil 
company, reportedly has reopened 
talks to acquire No. 2 Texaco Inc. j 
for about $37 billion in stock plus 
the assumption of debt.
The San Francisco-based 
Chevron was expected to offer I 
about 0.77 of a share, worth | 
$64.87 based on Friday's closing 
price, for each share of Texaco, The Wall Street Journal reported late 
Friday, citing a person familiar with 
the matter.
The companies were attempting 
to finalize a deal this weekend so a 
transaction could be announced 
Monday morning, although signifi
cant issues still need to be resolved, 
the newspaper said.
Fords troubles 
ignite lawsuits
CHICAGO (AP)  Chicago 
lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit 
Friday against Ford Motor Co. two 
days after a California state judge, 
in the first such directive by any 
court, told the carmaker to recall 
1.7 million Ford vehicles to check 
ignition systems.
Kenneth B. Moll & Associates 
filed the suit in Cook County 
Circuit Court on behalf of any Ford 
owner who claims damages or 
injuries as a result of the alleged 
design flaw, which is said to cause 
Fords to stall while moving, espe

McDonalds 
going nostaglic
NEW YORK (AP)  McDonalds 
Corp. is planning marketing tests 
on two new restaurant concepts 
next year, one patterned after a 
diner and another after a deli, 
according to Advertising Age.
In a report in this weeks issue 
which will be available Monday, 
the magazine says that McDonald's 
lead ad agency, DDB Worldwide, 
and its promotions firm Frankel 
have been assigned to work on 
marketing for the two concepts.
A spokeswoman for Oak Brook, 
Ill.-based McDonalds, declined to 
comment on the magazine report, 
saying, It would be absolutely mis
leading to jump to conclusions 
based on partial information and 
pure speculation.
Anna Rozenich said that for com
petitive reasons the company, the 
worlds largest fast-food chain, 
does not publicly discuss tests or 
ideas unless it has something to 
announce.
According to Advertising Age, 
executives close to the project 
whom it did not name say the diner 
prototype will be called The Diner 
at McDonalds, or something simi
lar. It would allow consumers to 
order from a kiosk and have a serv
er deliver their selections to the 
table.
The report said the other con
cept, a deli and ice cream shop, is 
meant to be attached to a conven
tional McDonald's, with a menu 
featuring deli meats, artisan 
breads, soups and fountain 
desserts.
Both projects were intended to 
open this year but were delayed, Advertising Age said.

Take a break from mid-semester stress and attend a fun event
PITTSBURGH, from page B14 
Blues in their name but arent quite the 
spitting image Qf Jake and Elwood 
Blues. For example, take the Jon 
Spencer Blues Explosion, who per
formed here in 1998. Does their ener
getic rock music explode? Yes. But its 
definitely not blues. Next, Blues 
Traveler will be performing on the CFA 
lawn (rain location: Soldiers and Sailors 
Hall) this Friday. Granted, there is more 
blues in their music than in Jon 
Spencers, but its still blues-rock. In 
addition, they are much cooler than Blues Clues, the childrens television 
show that wont be coming to campus 
anytime soon.
 While were talking about all these 
events coming up this weekend, you 
should know that they are part of 
Homecoming 2000. See, while many 
students are going home for mid-semester break, many alumni are also coming 
home. (It took me five minutes to think 
of that pun.) And just because you 
havent graduated yet doesnt mean that 
you cant enjoy what the campus has to 
offer during this festive weekend. If 
youre interested, you can find a com
plete schedule of events at www.cmu.edu/alumni/homecoming/ind ex.html.
 Indie-pop + riot grrrl rock = .too 
much fun? Not if you go to see the next
AB Coffeehouse concert, featuring 
Versus and Bratmobile next Monday 
the 23rd in McConomy Auditorium of 
the University Center at 8 pm. Both 
these bands have been legends in the 
independent music scene for almost a 
decade. So can there possibly be a better 
way to finish off your exciting mid
semester break?
 That Kathleen Turner sure does 
have a sultry voice. If her husky speech 
is the only aspect that comes to mind 
when you think of her, then you are 
ignoring her tremendous acting talent 
as seen in films such as Romancing the Stone and Peggy Sue Got Married. Now, 
shell be coming to the Byham Theater 
as part of her limited, pre-Broadway 
national tour of Tallulah, a onewoman play based on the life of actress 
Tallulah Bankhead. It opens next 
Tuesday the 24th and runs through 
November 5. Tickets may be purchased 
by calling 456-6666.
 Isnt it a shame when our main
stream popular culture glorifies artists 
like Alanis Morissette and Bon Jovi when 
they could easily be promoting music 
that can rock Saddam Husseins ass? 
Well, dont get uptight and eat the mul
let over it. One of Chicagos schizo
phrenic rock legends, Wesley Willis, is 
coming to the Millvale Industrial 
Theater in Millvale next Wednesday. So
grab your Big Mac from the nearest Rock 
n Roll McDonalds and take the Rock 'n 
Roll Superhighway to go see the musician who has achieved celebrity cult sta
tus at CMU. Speaking of which, its 
about time that he writes a song about 
our school. I dont know how it would 
go, but I humbly suggest the ending, 
Rock over Pittsburgh! Rock on Chicago! 
The HUB: Your one-stop shop for enroll-, 
ment services.
 After going to see Wesley Willis, prepare yourself to see one of. the oddest 
line-ups ever seen in the Pittsburgh 
music scene. Carnival band The Buzz 
Poets will be playing next Thursday 
night with, get this, 2 Live Crew. Yes, 
you heard me correctly. At Banana Joe's 
in the Strip District, you could see one 
the countrys most profane rap groups 
open for one of the areas favorite rock 
bands.
 Its about time that people look 
toward Schenley Park as more than just 
a summer movie theater and venue for 
sledding on Highlander trays during the 
winter. In fact, the Student Conservation 
Association (SCA) sees a park that needs 
help. Next Saturday the 28th, the SCA| 
will be holding a Pittsburgh Day of 
Service from 10 am to 2 pm at the park. 
This event is a community service pro
ject and is open to all volunteers in the 
community.

Film brings laughs back to sketch comedy spin-offs
FILM REVIEW
by Ish Harshawat
Editor-in-Chief
Critics tend to assign movies 
they review to one of several gen
res, such as comedy, drama, sus
pense, or horror. Among other 
things, this categorization gives 
both critics and moviegoers an 
easy way of judging the merit of a 
movie because they compare it to 
other movies in its particular 
genre.
Perhaps that is why The Ladies Man has not been getting such rave 
reviews. I think the reason for that, 
however, is the shortsightedness of 
critics around the country. When The Ladies Man is compared to 
such comedies as As Good As It Gets, of course it will fall flat on its 
face. However, if The Ladies Man is 
compared to other Saturday Night Live movies, including A Night at the Roxbury and Stuart Saves his Family, I think it scores quite well.The Ladies Man is based on a 
really funny skit on SNL involving 
Leon Phelps, who is also known as 
The Ladies Man on his talk show. 
Leon starts the movie in his radio 
studio, taking phone calls from lis
teners who ask Leon, the self-proclaimed expert on ladies (I have 
done a lot of them, he explains to 
the listeners) about their love lives. 
SNL viewers will be happy to see 
Phelpss favorite drink, 
Courvoisier Cognac, in tow.
The characters around Phelps 
arent complex or developed, but 
only lend support to his frequent 
innuendos and catch-phrases. The 
main one of these is Julie (Karyn 
Parsons, Hilary from the Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air), Phelpss radio 
producer who represents the 
woman Phelps should be with. 
The audience will immediately 
realize the basic plot, which has 
been rehashed several times 
before: Man and woman come to 
the realization, after much soulsearching throughout the movie, 
that they are made for each other. 
The plot is predictable, but really 
just serves to let Phelps display all 
the quirks in his character.
A side-story develops about a 
support group for men who have 
been victimized by Phelpss sleep
ing with their wives. The leader, 
Lance, played by Will Ferrell of SNL fame, and all others have 
experienced Phelps rushing out of 
their houses without clothes, shin
ing a smiley face tattoo on his butt 
as he runs off into the night. Thus, 
the name of the support group is 
Victims of the Smiley Ass (VSA). 
Parts of the movie featuring VSA 
members are funny, and one in 
particular had the entire theater 
laughing non-stop.
In many ways, the Ladies Man is 
similar to the Austin Powers 
movies (which can be considered a 
psuedo-SNL movie as Mike Myers 
is an SNL alum). Both movies 
involve a joke about a man who is 
irresistible to women, even though 
he is a complete loser. Both men 
are stuck in the past, Powers in the 
60s, Phelps in the 70s. Most of all, 
both movies are funny because 
they center around a character 
who is original and funny for his 
unique catch-phrases and weird 
habits.
SNL Productions has done a 
good job taking the skit and makTM & Copyright  2000 by Paramount Pictures. All Rights Reserved.

ing a film out of It, something they 
do not always do successfully (Superstar is another prime exam
ple of a complete failure.) Though The Ladies Man really doesnt add
too much to the comedic genre in 
general, it provides good enter
tainment. It made me laugh, and if 
you enjoy SNL skits, you will enjoy 
this movie.
Orchestra shuffles musical periods
by Aseem GuptaOnline Editor
- This past weekend the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra returned to 
the stage of Heinz Hall for a con
ceit under the direction of guest 
conductor Paavo Jrvi, music 
director of the Cincinnatti 
Symphony Orchestra. While the 
concert will certainly not be 
regarded as the most memorable 
concert of the season, the PSO 
delivered a solid performance 
under Jarvis leadership.
The concert commenced with 
Arvo Parts somber Cantus in 
Memory of Benjamin Britten. The 
piece was written in 1980 by Part in 
memory of one. of one of the twen
tieth centurys most influential 
composers. The Estonian composer 
wrote of Britten: In the past years, 
we have had so many losses in the 
world of music to mourn. Why did 
the date of Benjamin Brittens 
death  December 4, 1976  
touch such a chord in me? Part 
who was clearly touched by 
Brittens death composed the 
somber six minute piece which is 
scored for bell and strings to be a 
musical homage to the great British 
composer.
The audience barely new the 
piece started  as the orchestra 
started to play audience members 
were still quieting down. After a 
few measures the hall was silent 
except for the opening notes of 
Part's haunting piece. The simple 
piece, which based on varying 
rhythmic performances of the A 
minor scale, was arguably one of 
the most captivating openings 
played by the PSO in recent history. 
Jarvi did an excellent job of leading 
the PSO through the wide variety 
of dynamics that dot the piece-a 
performance that surely would 
have been doomed without careful 
attention to the simple piece's 
rhythm and contrast.
Pamela Frank, the evening's fea
tured soloist, took the stage to per
form Dvoraks Concerto in A minor 
for Violin and Orchestra. Th con
certo was first performed in Prague 
in October exactly 117 years ago, 
but had been commissioned four 
years earlier in 1879 at the request 
of Joseph Joachim, an eminent per
former of the day. In the years 
leading up to the commission 
Joachim performed Brahm's extra
ordinary violin concerto, and Max 
Bruchs concerti. Dvorak was eager 
to please Joachim, and over the 
course of several years, worked 
with Joachim to produce the work
in its final state. However Joachim 
did not premiere the piece; the 
piece was instead performed by 
Frantisek Ondriek on 14 October 
1883 in Pragues National Theater. 
Franks performance was brilliant 
 especially during the final move
ment, the most recognizable of the 
three. The performance brought 
the audience to their feet for a 
heartfelt ovation.
The concert concluded with a 
delightful performance of Carl 
Nielsens Symphony Number Five, a 
two-movement symphony written
in 1922. The performance under
scored the PSOs tremendous abili
ty to perform a wide variety' of 
music within the time frame of a 
single concert, giving each piece 
the attention it deserves. The PSO 
returns to the stage of Heinz Hall 
on October 27 under the direction 
of Maestro Jansons with Emanuel 
Ax performing Johannes Brahms's 
Concerto Number Two. Also fea
tured on the program will be Aaron 
Copland's Symphony for Organ and Orchestra with Thomas Murray on 
the organ.

Final Grade: B
by Debra HalpernStaffwriter
The Wallflowers third attempt, Breach, is a cozy 
but different follow up to their chart-topping album Bringing Down The Horse. It is cozy but different 
because one would not expect their new direction. 
The new album took four years to produce, and after 
hearing the outcome, it is easy to tell why it took so 
long. It seems when writing Breach, Jakob Dylan 
conjured up in a lab a different, but yet not too 
unique sound; the result: surf rock meets modern 
rock.
The new album starts out with a melodic riff 
under modern rock chording with Letters from the 
Wasteland. This theme continues throughout the 
album, but its strongest moment is in the first single 
off the album, Sleepwalker which shows off not 
only Dylans writing abilities, but the romantic he 
truly is. The album follows a pattern that Dylan 
penned himself, but his pattern allows room for difference. This style makes each song on the album 
group into a cohesive manner such that they are 
common to one another; but if theyre looked at 
closely, one can see the difference that weaves 
through each ones attempt to be heard in a differ
ent way. This kind of penmanship can only be 
appreciated by a true music lover.
The album does become more modern rock and 
less surf rock and breaks down into a more camp
fire feel toward the later end. Morning Train, 
which is the highlight of the album, gives the audi
ence an intimate setting with The Wallflowers. A 
close second to the in your living room feel is the 
end song, Birdcage, where Dylan sings, Are you 
holding me... such that it seems the audience is 
cradled in The Wallflowers realm of music.Breach is not an album that will move you or that 
should be played from beginning to end, but it does 
not contain one bad song. The album highlights 
Dylans songwriting abilities, and not once will th 
audience try to compare him to his father. It is clear 
from his work that he has come into his own. There 
is no neediness in Dylans lyrics that symbolize des
peration to be as good as his great papa. The 
Wallflowers hold it together as a band. Dylan does 
take the spotlight, but he never takes the credit 
away from his bandmates. Nor do the Wallflowers 
sell out by using their special guests Frank Black, 
Elvis Costello, Buddy Judge, Gary Louris, Chris 
Penn, and Michael Penn; instead, they do some
thing rare these days, they depend only their own 
music. Breach is the music industrys answer to 
commercialized rock. The Wallflowers are a highly 
commercial band, but the albums sound just miss
es the commercial category in todays music gener
ation.

Homecoming
All Weekend Long
As you probably know, next weekend, in addition to being 
mid-semester break, is Homecoming. As a result, the people in 
charge ofMcFlicks have elected to take a week off from screening 
the latest in blockbuster entertainment. This causes a slight 
problem for this column, since I rely heavily on the list of four 
movies that I am provided every week to barely even mention. 
So, in an effort not to have to do any original thinking, I solicit
ed the names of a number of random movies from people, and 
intend to pack as many as possible into this space. Enjoy.
. Ferris Buellers Day Off: Why on earth did Matthew 
Broderick agree to star in Godzilla?
Casablanca: Talk about an overrated movie. If it were real
ly any good, Im assuming I would have seen it by now.
Go: The best version of Pulp Fiction since Pulp Fiction.
Spaceballs: Sometimes I like to think what I could have 
accomplished had I not spent those 100 hours of my child
hood watching this not particularly good movie. I mean, 
Pizza the Hutt? Please.
The Wizard: This exceptionally tacky movie simultaneously 
made Super Mario Bros. 3 the best-selling game ever and 
made everyone in Hollywood think twice before OKing a 
Fred Savage movie.
Animal Instinct II: I seriously doubt this is even a movie. 
Whatever it is, Im sure the Fox network had a hand in it.
Pretty in Pink: Is Brat Pack a stupid term or what?
Clerks: The first time 1 saw Clerks, I watched it with my 
Mom. 1 filed that decision under mistakes.
The Usual Suspects: Have you ever been to a movie and felt 
like everyone understood it but you? You have? Moron.
Drunken Master: What a missed opportunity for a franchise! 
Drunkens OK and everything, but how good would Stoned 
Master be? For one hed be all slow and laid back, and for two 
hed be all paranoid and trying to beat up invisible people.
Swingers: As classic as this movie is, I still think it should 
issue an apology for bringing back swing. Maybe the pro
ducers could hold a joint press conference with Brian Setzer.
Double Jeopardy: This one actually wasnt selected at ran
dom, but I really, really hate everything about it. You know 
the plot: woman wrongly convicted of murder serves her 
time, gets out, finds hes still alive. So, because of that law 
where you cant be tried twice for the same crime, she can kill 
him without fear of repercussion. Let me first say that if you 
believe that premise, I dont want you reading my column 
ever again. If she did kill him, itd be a different time, and 
probably different place and weapon also. Not the same crime. 
Why doesnt anyone in the movie realize this? How could 
someone write a script about this? Who would ever see this? 
Why? Why? Why?
Manhattan Murder Mystery: Someone needs to have a seri
ous sit-down with Woody Allen. They need to watch Bananas 
and Sleeper with him so he remembers what is was like when 
he made really funny movies. Small Time Crooks just isnt cut
ting it, man.
Pulp Fiction: This is my favorite movie. The fact that I write 
this column makes me an expert on film. Therefore, this is 
the greatest movie ever.
The Cell: I read this mens magazine this summer that fea
tured a ranking of the 100 hottest women in the world, and 
Jennifer Lopez came in at number one. Either Sir Mix-a-Lot 
did all of the judging or else the readers of said magazine 
have some issues.
Coyote Ugly: I dont think I understand the mentality of the 
guy who goes to see this. Well, maybe on one level, but over
all there are really no excuses. Sure, theres some fine-looking 
women, but I can provide you with about a dozen ways to get 
the same female influx without watching a terrible movie.
Heat: Any movie that crosses the 100-minute mark is seri
ously infringing on my attention span. Im sure theres lots of 
great long movies: The Godfather and Gone With the Wind 
come to mind, but when movies get that long, its almost like 
reading a book. Yuck.
The Exorcist: I saw this movie yesterday and have to say that 
its the most disturbing thing Ive seen since Michael Jordan 
hit that shot to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1989 NBA 
playoffs. (Im going to get you, Michael.,0

@pgh.cafe job fair espouses regional 
opportunities in high-technology sector
Havard pupils flock to fledging startups

The Pittsburgh Technology Council is hoping to retain graduate talent from 
area universities. The PTC held its fifth annual pgh.cafe job fair, a suc

new employees. The Greenhouse is a
by Brad Grantz
Business Editor
-' Job-hunting is a practice of the 
past at Carnegie Mellon University. 
Students have benefited from over 
350 different companies recruiting 
CMU talent during job fairs in the 
first semester. Attempting to stem 
the exodus of university talent, the 
Pittsburgh Technology Council 
(PTC) held the fifth annual 
@pgh.caf, a job fair unique to 
regional technology companies on 
Tuesday, October 10 in the Rangos 
Ballroom. Over 75 businesses, 
ranging from software design, to 
networking products, attended in 
the hopes of obtaining a few 
recruits to aid in their burgeoning 
high-tech firms.
 Over 450 CMU students attended 
the fair, compared to a paltry 250 
at the University of Pittsburghs 
@pgh.cafe one week earlier. The 
PTC also plans to visit Robert 
Morris and Penn State University, 
plain campus, to promote its mem
ber companies.
I thought CMU students would 
suffer from job fair burnout, said 
Cindy Tabor, Career Center admin
istrator for the PTC, making an 
obvious reference to the TOC and 
BOC among other recruiting 
events.
The Pittsburgh Digital 
Greenhouse was on hand to recruit
non-profit, state-funded consortium 
of chip design companies interested 
in expanding the researching and 
manufacturing aspects of the region. 
The organization also provides ser
vices to its member companies such 
as talent recruitment and business 
connections. Member firms include 
Sony and Tyco Electronics. 
According to chief executive officer 
and former Carnegie Mellon 
employee Dennis Yablonsky, one of 
the Greenhouses purposes is to 
retain a large percentage of the grad
uates from CMU and titt. Yablonsky 
highlighted three other goals of the 
Greenhouse  to encourage a net
work of quality jobs, create a critical 
mass of other supporting technology 
companies, and promote the regions 
high quality of life.
Its common knowledge that the 
way to college students hearts is 
through their starving stomaches. 
If so, the PTC fair definitely took 
the cake, or rather served it. The 
PTC hired floor servers to circulate 
finger foods and hors doeurves. 
Specialty coffees were available to 
attendees and a jazz ensemble pro
vided tunes to surpass the atmos
phere of all prior job fairs conduct
ed at CMU.
Tabor measured the success of 
the event with a different angle. I 
think the success would be in the 
companies. If one company hired 
one great CMU summer intern, I
would consider that a success.
Almost every startup company 
had ties to the University in one 
manner or another. Steel River 
Systems specializes in creating soft
ware that builds digital signal pro
cessing applications. Both compa
ny representatives, Sherif Shaher 
(EE) and David Chambliss (BA), 
were 1989 Carnegie Mellon gradu
ates.
Both had worked in the technolo
gy industry and found what the 
tools were absent in the main
stream and left to develop their 
tool.
Steel River Systems obtained its 
phase one and two funding from 
Innovation Works, a local non-profit agency dedicated to provide seed 
capital for unique technical ideas in 
the region.
The relaxed owners were excited 
about the prospects for the 
Pittsburgh area, saying Pittsburgh 
is rapidly becoming a tech hub. 
They both cited the high quality of 
life for their stay in the city as well 
as their love affair with the citys 
football franchise, the Steelers.
The PTC, considered the largest 
trade organization in the nation, 
hoped to extend, not only the posi
tives of the region, but also lend a 
hand to its member companies, 
who might otherwise be unable to 
compete with the Microsofts and 
Intels at the TOC and BOC.
Tabor stated that many of the 
firms in attendance do not have the 
human capital and resources to 
spend on large-scale recruiting mis
sions. .
They dont have the HR [human 
resources] capacity to recruit local
ly, let alone nationally. They want 
to be the best of the best like every 
other company. We [the PTC] have 
to find a way to help them.
Tabor and the PTC is working to 
expand the presence of regional 
high-tech companies in the college 
community. She has worked on the 
organizations career Web site in 
order to make it more user-friendly 
for member companies searching 
for talented individuals.
What we would like to do is get 
the PTC Career Center in front of 
CMU students and let them know 
that leaving Pittsburgh isnt neces
sarily the best option.

U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - 
For students with backgrounds in 
computer science, Internet startup 
companies - with their exotic stock 
options, sky-high signing bonuses 
and bright prospects - have long 
presented attractive career oppor
tunities after graduation.
But some are discovering that the 
picture can sometimes be less rosy 
than it seems. Just ask the Harvard 
University graduates who were 
hired at the end of the last academ
ic year by MicroStrategy, a software 
company in Vienna, Va. at least a 
dozen, one graduate estimates.
Like many other tech companies, 
MicroStrategy found its stock 
plunging this spring. Still, the
recent graduates who had received 
job offers were told not to worry 
because their jobs would not be 
affected, according to The Washington Post.
But just weeks before they were 
to begin work, 236 college gradu
ates who. had accepted job offers 
were abruptly terminated - after 
having turned down other compa
nies. Many employees had already 
made housing arrangments. 
Former MicroStrategy employees 
signed non-disclosure agreements 
with the company and declined to 
comment.
The MicroStrategy story is not 
unfamiliar to students venturing 
into the high-tech world. After
years of seemingly limitless 
growth, many Internet companies 
have been forced to face the reali
ties of business.
A report published by Webmergers.com in August revealed 
that of 238 startup companies pro
filed, 41 shut down this year, 83 
withdrew plans for initial public 
offerings (IPOs) and nearly 30 had 
been sold in fire sales after run
ning short of cash.
But despite the sea of uncertainty 
associated with startups, many stu
dents are sticking by them. 
Computer science concentrators 
and others say the excitement of 
working at a potentially lucrative 
dot-com is worth the risk.
Tips for entrepeneurial 
hopefuls....
Keep your investors informed.
Give them projected and reached 
milestones, especially after they pro
vide capital.
Surround yourself with experts.
Have board members of your 
industry, giants serve on your board.
Be a psychologist.
CEOs have to know how to make 
and keep all employees happy. Be 
empathetic and keep attrition rates 
low.
Consider marketing carefully.
Misguided marketing can be a mil
lion dollar waste in money that never 
reaches its intended audience.
Admit your mistakes.
Theres no time for pride in a new 
business.
Be too stupid to quit.
If youve already decided to come 
this far, you owe it to yourself to follow 
your idea until its very end.
Keep tabs on whats yours.
Protect your' intellectual proper
tythroughout history, the best ideas 
have been stolen.
Recognize your weaknesses.
Every CEO is dependent on the tal
ents of her employees. Be aware of 
this and use it to your advantage.
Be a big fish in a little pond.
Do business in Pittsburgh.

STARTUP, from page B4
Chopra said of the question: 
Hire athletes; people who can run 
with the ball.
He has that in spades at his com
pany, but admitted to marketing 
blunders that OnlineChoice has 
committed. Recently they spent $7 
million on a television campaign 
for which the budget ran out as 
soon as it began. Its impact was 
minimal; he polled the audience as 
to whether they knew of 
OnlineChoice. Only a smattering of 
hands were raised.
Guttman said of his mistakes: 
dont be afraid to cannibalize 
yourself. If a plan or a project is 
going to fail, recognize it early. 
Budgets and time are too tight for 
egotism.
Ironically, Sander said his com
panys biggest mistake to date was 
pointed out by John Doerr, a part
ner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & 
Byers, a premier venture capital 
firm. Doerr pointed out that 
SightSound.com, by distributing 
music on the Internet, was taking 
profits from the very sponsors they 
were trying to get funding from. 
Sander came home and took the 
website offline and went back to 
the drawing board for years before 
re-emerging as a provider of smalldistribution videos.
To succeed as a start-up CEO, 
Sanjay Chopra said, you need the 
fire in your belly and to be 150 per
cent dedicated. Teller said that two 
things in life are hard to do: have 
kids, and start your own business. 
I dont know how people do 
[either] on their own, he contin
ued.
Once a start-up begins to grow, 
attracting new talent begins to take 
center stage* Sander advised not to 
underhandedly lure other compa
nys star players away, but to be 
wonderful, so revolutionary, and so 
attractive that the star players 
choose on their own to join your 
cause.
When asked after the discussion 
about his interaction with universi
ties, Teller said he is glad to have 
the chance to give back. This past; 
summer, BodyMedia employed one 
intern from Pitt and three from 
Carnegie Mellon. He has also been 
making efforts to work with depart
ments to give speeches and talks ori 
campus this semester.
The days keynote speaker was Toni 
Gill, former CFO of Fore Systems. His 
advice was similar to others: We [ori 
the Board] recognized what we 
brought to the table, but also that we 
were dependent on other peoples tal
ents. Each team at Fore Systems was 
intended to be fully scalable and each, 
employee was given the tools to man
age that change.
Two years ago, Fore Systems was: 
purchased by Marconi Corporation 
for $4.5 billion. The company-still 
retains a large Pittsburgh presence.1

Merck is where I can have the 
greatest effect on human life

on life. At Merck, improving patient health isn't just what we

BioTHE TARTAN  OCTOBER 16, 2000
The Tartans Squirrel Hill Dining Guide
Just up Forbes Avenue, a neigh
borhood exists where you may go 
frequently to do your food shop
ping, movie viewing, or even bowl
ing. However, in Squirrel Hill, you 
could find just about anything to 
eat as well.
The Tartan restaurant reviewers 
take a 61 bus and head over there 
to give you the scoop on what the 
area has to offer hungry students.
Boston Market
If youre as sick as I am of the dis
turbingly cute smiles and slow ser
vice of the Squirrel Hill Eat n Park 
you will be happy to know that 
there is alternate eating establish
ment which serves great food both 
quickly and economically.
A couple days ago I was cruising 
the streets of Squirrel Hill in search 
of a quick bite to eat. I came across 
the Boston Market, which is located 
on Forbes Avenue one block past 
Murray, and decided to give it a try. 
The Market serves up an array of 
home-style meals like roasted 
turkey, fresh chicken, and beef 
accompanied with your choice of a 
side dish that can be anything from 
chicken noodle soup to freshly 
steamed vegetables. Most lunch 
and dinner entrees run from $5 - 
$9 depending on the type of meat 
and the number of side dishes.
I am impressed with the quality 
of food the Market has to offer. I 
think the food tastes much better at 
the Market than at the Eatn Park or 
the UC. However, the interior of the 
Boston Market lacks the charm and 
warmth of the Eat n Park. My solu
tion is to get you food to go at 
Boston Market and take it to the Eat 
n Park where your friends will still 
be waiting for their food. I have 
found that the Boston Market is 
adequately staffed, ensuring that 
you get your food without waiting 
for incompetent food preparation 
or standing forever in line.
A healthy meal can most definite
ly be found at the Boston Market. 
For dinner, I recommend the chick
en dinner accompanied with 
steamed vegetables and green 
beans. For lunch, a chicken or beef 
Carver is a wonderful sandwich 
for the busy CMU student on the go.
All in all, the Boston Market in 
Squirrel Hill is a great place to eat 
because it offers quick service, 
quality food, and an excellent 
value.
 RYAN FRIEDMAN
Eat n Park
When it is 10:30 at night, and you 
just feel like grabbing something 
other than the vast delights offered 
by the school food venues, Eat n 
Park always come through. The 
east coast relative of the national 
chain Dennys does provide more 
than just a place to hang out any
time of the day.
Since Ive arrived in Pittsburgh, 
my three visits to Eat n Park have 
left me full without depleting much 
if anything at all from my wallet 
every time. I must profess though 
that I automatically turn to the 
Breakfast served anytime page 
whenever entering one of these 
diners. On my most recent visit to 
the 24-hour, student-frequented 
Eat n Park in Squirrel Hill, my two 
friends and I ended up ordering 
breakfast, an appetizer and dessertat dinnertime. This time our wait
ress was nice and peppy, though 
Ive realized you can never know 
what kind of service to expect 
there. The time before, my friend 
gave his last name while we waited 
for a table, and the hostess just 
stared blankly at us and asked, as if 
it was our fault she couldnt spell or 
even want to try, Dont you have 
another name? Not to mention the 
time a waitress literally took 15 
minutes to realize that you swipe 
the CMU ID card to use DineXpress 
on the credit card machine.
Our food arrived promptly as 
usual. My blueberry pancakes were 
fluffy and filled with blueberries 
but were a tad too soft. The onion 
rings were not drenched in oil, yet 
crunchy each time. The strawberry 
shortcake is highly recommended. 
It arrived with a heavenly heap of 
whipped cream and sliced straw
berries piled on top. As for the 
warm apple pie, I might request less 
caramel next time but other than 
that it didnt take long for the three 
of us to dig in and clean of our
plates.
Vast breakfast selections run 
from $4 - $6 and are served all day. 
Lunch and dinner includes items 
such as cheeseburgers to marinated 
grilled porkchops, and ranges from 
$6 - $10 an entre. The coolest 
part though is being able to use 
your DineXpress or CampusXpress 
there, allowing you to escape 
school food when you need to.
 CORY TONG
Gulliftys
Gulliftys in Squirrel Hill is about 
the closest a restaurant serving 
American cuisine can get to being 
considered quirky. EVen though this 
new trend of sit-down, family
American restaurant chains (e.g., 
Bennigans, TGIFridays, Houlihans) 
try to be different with their collec
tions of wall bric-a-brac and clever 
food names, they all boil down to 
the same tired act. The atmosphere 
and feel of Gulliftys is distinct, 
however.
From outside the restaurant, you 
get a quick glimpse of its individual
ity from their sign which boasts 
itself as A Unique Eatery. The 
inside is a large room with several 
levels of floors and staircases to 
reach them. Instead of bombarding 
its customers with meaningless 
nostalgia and traffic signs like many 
places do these days, Gulliftys uses 
fewer decorations that are much 
more artistic.
There was enough capacity so 
that we did not have to wait long to 
be seated even though it was a 
Friday evening. In addition, the 
waitress was quick to take our bev
erage and food orders after five 
minutes of sitting down. A reason
able amount of time passed before 
we received our garden salads and 
soup that came with the dinners, 
but the-meal came too quickly 
thereafter. More time to eat the first 
coilrse would have been desirable.
One of the reasons why Guliftys 
is so exceptional for an American 
restaurant is that it serves more 
than just American food. If youre 
not in the mood for a steak or sand
wich, you can sample one of their 
many pasta, Mexican, calzone, or 
pizza dishes. Even the pickiest of 
diners should find something they 
like here.
All of the customers at my table 
agreed that while the quality of the 
food was not bad, it was not unfor
gettable either, especially consider
ing the price that was pushing the 
limits of a college student. (An 
entree runs anywhere from $8 to 
$15.) All too often, the extensive 
list of ingredients featured in the
menu would be discernible in the 
actual meal. For example, the roast
ed garlic zingara I ordered had 
about every possible vegetable 
known to humankind servered over 
pasta. In the end, however, all I was 
able to taste was the garlic and red 
peppers.
While the food served at 
Gulliftys may be merely satisfacto
ry, its their desserts that put them 
on the map. They have over twodozen different kinds of pies and 
cakes as well as an entire wall of 
Best Dessert in Pittsburgh 
awards. They are baked daily on the 
premises so that they are fresh. Try 
the cheesecake, its some of the best 
youll find outside of the Big Apple. 
If youre a pie kind of guy, however, 
go for the chocolate cream pie. You 
wont be disappointed except that 
you may not be able to fit it all in
your stomach due to the large por
tion.
The bottom line is that there are 
few who can beat Gulliftys 
desserts. The food, on the other 
hand, I believe the problem is that 
they spread themselves too thin. 
Their thick menu is just simply so 
large and diverse that their chefs 
cant really focus on making and 
fine-tuning extraordinary meals. 
My recommendation is go to 
Gulliftys when you arent exactly 
sure what youre in the mood for or 
you just want to get dessert follow
ing a movie. But whatever, you do, 
make sure you leave room for 
dessert.

Lemongrass
Attention, CMU! Are you tired of 
campus food? Are the Highlanders 
attempts at Asian cuisine just not 
cutting it any more? (Were they 
ever?) Well, a quick trip on the 61C 
can cure your mealtime woes. This 
weekend, a group of hungry stu
dents ventured out to Lemongrass 
Thai Cuisine, and the experience 
was anything but sour.
Located on Forbes Avenue just 
past the Murray Avenue intersec
tion, this Squirrel Hill restaurant 
tends to be easily overlooked. 
Nonetheless, if you persevere and 
can manage to spot the hidden 
niche above the Hit or Miss cloth
ing store, youll likely be in for quite 
a treat.
Our experience at Lemongrass 
consisted of innovative cuisine, 
attentive service, and a culturally 
unique atmosphere. Although we 
visited on a Friday evening, we 
were seated in less than five min
utes, and had only a short time to 
admire the candlelit tables and artf dcor before our orders were 
taken. Lemongrass offers a wide 
variety of Thai cuisine, ranging 
from soups, salads, and coconut 
desserts to entrees of tofu or noo
dles to squid. Two features of the 
meal were especially appealing, 
namely a choice of meat with ones 
entre (chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, 
or a combination), and a you-select 
spiciness scale that ranges from 1-
10 for certain foods.
After much agonizing debate as a 
first-timer of Thai cuisine, I ordered 
the Lemongrass noodles with 
shrimp. Our meals arrived in a 
timely fashion, complete with a 
large bowl of rice for the entire 
table to share. My noodles, while 
plentiful and served in a garlic 
sauce of napa and basil leaves, were 
so flavorful that I found it difficult 
to finish. One companions order,
salmon in paradise, was a definite 
treat, complemented well by a spicy 
curry sauce. If there was a downfall 
to Lemongrasss food, however; it 
was inconsistency in spiciness lev
els. While I consider myself to be a 
connoisseur of fiery foods and 
found a 6 to be somewhat mild, my 
roommate, for instance, found her 
stir-fry chicken with basil leaves at 
a 1 to be unbearable. I took no 
offense, however, and gladly ate a 
large portion of her meal without 
abandon, which I enjoyed while 
praying I would not get slapped 
with a disgruntled room change 
request from my roomie once our 
dining was over.
The experience was a pleasantly 
attentive change of pace from most 
food establishments. The waitstaff 
made every attempt to treat us as 
though we were the most important 
customers there (leading us to won
der if they suspected we were writ
ing. a restaurant review!), and it 
was a small but well-valued indul
gence with most entrees ranging 
from $8.50-$13.95.
 KRISTIN LALA
Mediterranean Grill
The Mediterranean Grill  or the 
Mediterranean Restaurant, 
depending on which sign you look 
at  is a well-kept Squirrel Hill 
secret. It takes some conviction to 
find the basement locale, but is 
worth the search.
The day I visited, the girl who 
greeted and served patrons was 
warm and friendly  in fact, she 
teased one man who came in that 
he was late today. I sat down in one 
of the red velvet chairs, which was 
comfortable but far too low com
pared to the table, even for me as a 
tall person.
Music played softly over the ceil
ing speakers, which seemed 
authentic and set a fitting mood. Up 
front at the cash register there was 
a series of artifacts of the region, 
including smoking pipes and goldplated porcelain.
The lunch specials, served from 
11:30am - 4:30pm, are reasonably 
priced from $7.50 to $8.25, and the 
most expensive item on the menu is 
still only $12.50. Many dishes 
include lamb, chicken, beef, chick
peas, zucchini, mushrooms, or pine 
nuts. They serve  la carte items, 
sandwiches, mixtures (which 
look like meatloaf), soups, salads, 
and pastries.
I ordered the Baked Kibbee lun
cheon entre and yogurt salad on 
the side. The zucchini in the salad 
was crisp and freshly cut, but the 
yogurt was so tart it made me
squint with every bite. The Kibbee 
had a great texture with its onions 
and pine nuts. Its more filling than 
it looks, so come with a decent 
appetite. Fresh pita bread is includ
ed with every entre, which was 
delicious but not very warm.
Service is relatively fast  I wait
ed about fifteen minutes for my 
food, and other guests came and 
left in the time I was there.
Curiously, the menu requests 
that you do not request substitu
tions in any item. Those allergic to 
nuts therefore have to be choosy, 
but vegetarians and vegans will 
find a wide selection, from Falafel 
to eggplant dishes.
 BLAKE ENGEL
Murray Ave. Grill
A quaint and cozy restaurant situ
ated in the heart of Squirrel Hill, 
the Murray Avenue Grill offers food 
with a quality taste and a quality 
presentation. The cheese tortellini 
with spinach and sun-dried toma
toes that I ordered not only had a 
savory taste but also looked like a 
work of art. The homemade Italian 
bread sat comfortably on my salad 
bowl, which was colorfully 
arranged with different types of let
tuce, tomatoes and olives. Even the 
dessert, a thick slice of chocolate 
chip cheesecake, the waitress 
placed in front of me with the fudge 
evenly drizzled across the plate. 
Such an edible masterpiece made 
me feel as though I was in an art 
museum!
To match the beauty of the food, 
various artsy pictures adorn the 
walls, attracting the customers eye 
while he waits for his food to cook. 
The food is then served with a kind 
smile, for the waitress catered to 
every need, making sure that my
glass was filled with iced tea and 
that the table was clear of irty 
unwanted dishes. One of the wait
resses even offered her advice'to 
some undecided customers; about 
which foods to order.
The menu presents much variety, 
from New York strip steak to a hafnburger with fries. Specials are. 
offered every Thursday, and the 
desserts vary from night to night, 
including apple dumplings with/ 
maple syrup or ice cream froin Dave 
and Andys. Also, the portions are 
quite generous. No customer leaves 
hungry, thats for sure. Certainly, 
this exquisite cuisine has its price. 
The cost of food ranges from about 
$8 to $13. Even though this restau
rant is more expensive than Eat n 
Park, for example, the price is rea
sonable for the high value of there 
atmosphere, food and service.
With a bar at one end and booths 
at the other, people of all ages can 
find this restaurant pleasing. The ' 
Murray Avenue Grill provides a 
casual yet sophisticated aura that 
makes the customers feel at ease. 
With no doubt whatsoever in-my' 
mind, I give this restaurant an A. h: 
will' definitely return , soon and 
leave with a full stomach. r i

New Dumpling 
House
iVV
Theres nothing new about New 
Dumpling House. As soon as you 
enter through the front door youre., 
transported back a couple 
decades through the restauraijt^s , 
vinyl booths and fading paint,,: 
While the decor leaves something, 
to be desired, the space is well lit 
and pleasant, in an eighties sort of . 
way. Our booth was next'to the-, 
kitchen, even though the restaurant -, 
was empty. It appeared that all. of . 
the customers were in the general 
vicinity of the kitchen in an appar-, 
ent attempt to limit the walk of the ~ 
waitperson between the kitchen, 
and the tables.
Even though we were close to the 
grills, the service was slow in com
ing. After two requests for water-we 
were given some of Pittsburgh^, 
finest. While sipping our chilled 
beverages, we read over the sur
prisingly easy-to-read menu. I 
selected the Scallion Pancakes on 
the menu while my friend chose the 
Hacked Chicken in Hot Sauce.- 
From the soup selections I decided 
upon the Velvet Chicken Com Soup 
and my friend had the Phoenix and 
Dragon Soup. While the waitper
son went to retrieve our appetizers, 
we continued to read over the 
detailed and apparendy complete ' 
menu. , -:c,! ,i
Duck is one of my favorite dishes, 
and if prepared properly is simply 
delectable. Perhaps some of the 
finest Chinese duck can be found in 
the tiny back alleys of London,?  
China Town where it hangs precan-. 
ously in the vendors front window 
along slabs of pork and other : 
assorted meats. I chose the Crispy 
Duck Szechuan style from the 
House Specialties section along 
with an order of Moo Goo Gai Pan. 
We decided to go Dutch, and .my 
friend ordered Ta-Chien ChickgDu 
and New Triple Vegetable. ,i :,
The appetizers left something to 
be desired. The egg rolls were stan
dard issue, but the Velvet Chicken 
Corn Soup was (jut of this world. 
My friends Hacked Chicken in Hot i 
Sauce was tantalizing, and he said 
that his Phoenix and Dragon soupwas the best he had tasted sincerhis^ 
1996 trip to China. Our main dish 
es arrived a short time later. The 
dishes were arranged in the center 
of the table, and we both selected a 
few spoonfuls from each tray. - '
The food was fairlystandard real
ly, with the Moo Goo Gai Pan as^the 
highlight of the meal. The duck 
was less than brilliant as the outer 
skin was a little too crispy and the 
sauce a litde too tangy. The vegeta
bles were well cooked, as was-the 1 
Ta-Chien Chicken. Both chicken 
dishes were good as the chicken 
was tender and the vegetables juipy.;
New Dumpling House was oyer.-.1 
all a pretty standard Chinese 
restaurant experience with no clear 
upside or downside. If youre look
ing for a quick, reasonable Chinese! 
meal, then New Dumpling House, is, 
your place. However if youre lQfiJkii 
ing for something a litde bit more 
upscale, then you might :want to 
check out another restaurant.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 16, 2000THH
From Mediterranean to Vegetarian
Panera
Its happened to all of us at one 
time or another. You are working 
on campus during the evening, you 
have classes late in the afternoon 
and you need to be back shortly for 
activities or another class. You are 
also;sick of the restaurants of Craig 
Street and the University Center. 
What do you do? Next time this 
happens, you might try Panera 
Bread in Squirrel Hill. Panera is 
located on Murray Avenue, close to 
the comer with Forbes. If you take a 
613-bus to the Forbes and Murray 
bus stop, it is one of the first things 
that you see as you leave the bus.
Inside, the restaurant has two 
parts, a bakery and the sandwich, 
soup and salad line. The bakery 
offers a variety of fresh breads and 
other baked goods. The other half 
offers a variety of salads, sandwich
es and a few soups of the day.
. I went with a couple of friends to 
review the restaurant one evening. 
I chose the Chicken Caesar salad. It 
was delicious and the presentation 
was very appetizing  unusual for 
a quick chain restaurant.
The only flaw was that a couple 
of pieces of chicken were somewhat 
frozen.
They prepare all of the food 
beforehand and simply mix the 
salad when you get there. It was 
only a couple of pieces though, so it 
did not take anything away from an 
otherwise delicious salad.
We also ordered a cinnamon 
muffin from the bakery and a 
chicken sandwich. The muffin, like 
everything at the bakery was 
mouth-watering and actually deli
cious. The sandwich was a little less 
appealing. While the food was 
tasty, the preparer had cut the 
bread at a harsh angle so that half 
of the sandwich was not actually in 
the bread. The quality was good if 
not the presentation.
Overall, this restaurant was a 
good experience. A sandwich or 
salad and a drink cost between $5 
andJ$7. The quality of the food was 
excellent, particularly for a chain 
restaurant and the service was 
quick. The only real complaint was 
the'attention to detail. Compared to 
I other restaurants of the same speed 
however, it was excellent.

Pi Pizza
The people behind Pi, one of the 
newest restaurants in Squirrel Hill, 
have clearly been doing their mar
ket research. Theyve come up with 
the perfect concept to attract CMU 
business  an upscale pizza place 
whose name is a cheesy mathemat
ical jbun.
Pi-is casual enough for students, 
fancy enough for business lunches, 
arid-yummy enough for anyone 
who likes good food. Its hard to 
miss the trendy yet quirky atmos
phere, which you can take in as you 
wait for your table. Theres a good 
chance that there will be a wait, 
even on weeknights, since the 
restaurant is crammed into a tiny 
storefront.
Menus are sleekly designed and 
decorated with the namesake num
ber in both Greek and Arabic forms, 
as well as some circles and equa
tions for good measure. The furni
ture and table settings are all wellchosen and modern-looking, from 
the metallic mesh chairs to the 
blue-green ceramic plates. The 
black-clad waitstaff  all of whom 
seem to wear stylishly small wirerimmed glasses  are attentive but 
not annoying about it.
If the restaurants name doesnt 
clue you in to the restaurants sense 
of humor, the sculpted body parts 
sticking out from the walls should 
;do it. Pi boasts a giant nose along 
ne ^all and a matching ear on the 
other.
At any rate, the delicious smells 
of the food made me think there 
niight be some reason behind the 
nose after all. Half of the menu is 
devoted to pizzas with every con
ceivable combination of toppings, 
but Customers can also choose from 
a small selection of other Italianfinspired dishes like panini sand
wiches and pastas, as well as com
pletely non-Italian things like 
Caesar salad topped with cornmeal-crusted chicken.
We decided to split a small pizza 
:as an appetizer. Unfortunately, the 
sheer number of pizzas offered 
made it difficult to decide. Do we 
Set the Thai Spring Vegetable Pizza
with lemongrass-soaked veggies, or 
just something plain and simple? 
We finally settled on a pie with arti
chokes, olives, and red peppers. It 
tasted good enough  with a crisp, 
buttery, vaguely sweet crust and 
fresh toppings  to make me want 
to swear off Papa Johns right then 
and there. But, even taking into 
account their high quality, the piz
zas seem a little too pricey for the 
average CMU math geek. They start 
at around $9 for a small basic tomato-and-cheese pie and go steadily 
up from there.
Other entrees are also on the 
expensive side. I felt like I was pay
ing for attitude and atmosphere as 
much as for the food itself. Ten dol
lars get you an order of cavatappi 
pasta and tomato sauce thats tasty 
if not particularly memorable. But 
while most restaurants that charge 
that much for a plate of pasta
include a side salad or something in 
the cost, Pi doesnt give you so 
much as a few pieces of bread. An 
Italian Cobb salad ($8.95) looked 
almost like an antipasto platter, 
with assorted vegetables and a vari
ety of rich cheeses.
Desserts at Pi are equally rich. 
Cheesecake, which comes in sever
al variations, tastes like the genuine 
Italian kind with ricotta instead of 
cream cheese. The cannoli, with 
chocolate-nut filling, is one of the 
best Ive had anywhere.

Saris
Saris is the kind of place that you 
could only find in Squirrel Hill. It 
serves all the sorts of foods you 
might expect from an American 
sandwich shop  sandwiches, sal
ads, soup, baked goods, and fresh 
pizza  with one difference. Saris, 
as a Jewish-owned and operated 
restaurant in the heart of Squirrel 
Hills Jewish neighborhood, is com
pletely kosher. And because they 
serve pizza and other dishes with 
cheese, they cant serve meat  
making it vegetarian (although, 
they serve fish), quite by accident.
Thats why, despite my vegetari
anism, I felt just a teeny little bit out 
of place when I walked in, a blatant 
shiksa in a room full of yarmulkes 
and Sabbath suits. It was Friday 
afternoon, and the place was 
packed with families enjoying a late 
lunch before sundown and groups 
of Jewish teenagers enjoying an 
after-school pizza. As it turned out, 
though, the guy behind the counter 
(resplendent in his homemade 
Saris yarmulke) was quite friendly 
to me despite my gentile status. He 
nudged aside a chatting friend to 
let me see the short menu, commis
erated when my cell phone rang in 
the middle of my order, and took
my order with a smile.
I was tempted by their pizza 
($1.60 a slice, $5.95 for a personal 
pie, $10.95 for a sixteen-inch tradi
tional pie) and calzones ($3.95 
small, $6.95 large), all the product 
of the large ovens visible directiy 
behind the counter, but decided to 
try their sandwich and salad combo 
($6.95, and you can substitute the 
soup of the day for either) instead. 
For my trouble, I got a medium
sized Greek salad and a grilled 
portabella sandwich. The salad was 
your standard Greek salad  toma
toes, red onions, black olives, and 
feta cheese  except for one thing: 
the lettuce was romaine rather than 
iceberg, making it perhaps more 
genuinely Greek and definitely bet
ter. While the tomatoes were a little 
under-ripe (and what isnt in 
Pittsburgh?), it had just the right 
amount of feta: not so much that
its overwhelming, but enough to 
make things interesting. The sand
wich, however, was a little more 
interesting. It featured- a large 
portabella mushroom cap that had 
not only been grilled to juicy per
fection, but grilled with bell pep
pers and onions, with cheese melt
ed on top. The only thing that 
marred my enjoyment of the sand
wich was the roll, which was a 
generic white-bread roll that disin
tegrated quickly under all the mois
ture from the grilled mushroom. I 
ended up eating my sandwich with 
a fork and knife, which certainly 
worked, but lacked that stuffingyour-face quality that hungry sandwich-eaters like myself enjoy.
The food was certainly all right, 
and not a bad lunch for the price, 
but the real draw of Saris seems to 
be the people. It seemed like a real 
community establishment, a hole in 
the wall where everyone knows 
your name, a hangout where 
Jewish kids could go after school 
and Jewish grandparents could 
take their grandkids knowing they 
could get kosher food and friendly 
conversation.
At the end of the meal, I was 
tempted by Saris collection of 
baked goods  muffins, biscotti, 
knishes, cheesecake, and various 
pastries whose names I cannot 
begin to recall  all made on the 
premises. I declined, however, in 
favor of making my escape into the 
gentile world of a 61C, where 
nobody knew my name but nobody 
suspected my religion or lack there
of, either.
 LORELEI LAIRD
Sichuan House
Authentic or otherwise, Sichuan 
House has some of the best Chinese 
food I've tasted in Pittsburgh. 
Located on Murray Avenue (for the
benefit of you first-years, thats the 
main drag in Squirrel Hill) across 
the street from the Giant Eagle, it's 
a delightful change from the 
greasy, warmed-over delivery fare 
that so often becomes a students 
only experience with Chinese food.
The first thing you will notice 
about Sichuan House may be the 
dcor. While perhaps more dimlylit than it needs to be, the inside of 
the restaurant is interesting yet 
comfortable, decorated with 
ornate Asian-looking carvings and 
hanging lamps. The dining room is 
quite large, which made it easy for 
them to accommodate our party of 
eight quickly.
Veggie lovers will be pleased to 
know that they take their vegeta
bles seriously at Sichuan House  
in every dish, the vegetables were 
obviously fresh, tender yet crisp, 
and never drowned in sauce or
overcooked. In particular, I direct 
broccoli lovers to the straw mush
rooms in Yushan sauce, a lightly 
spicy pile of tender broccoli spears 
with cute little mushrooms hiding 
among them, covered in (but not 
overpowered by) a brown, garlicky 
sauce. The bean curd with black 
mushrooms also merits mention 
for its treatment of the tofu, which 
is so often deep-fried until all you 
can taste is the vegetable oil. Not 
hereinstead, it's cut large, fried 
just enough to make the texture 
interesting, then combined with 
large black mushroom caps and a 
savory brown sauce.
In fact, they take all of their food 
seriously at this restaurant, as the 
meat dishes attest. From old stand
bys like General Tso's chicken and 
sweet and sour pork to the more 
unusual Happy Family, the meat 
was adjudged to be tender, with 
just the right amount of saltiness. 
The General Tso's, sweet and gar
nished with a maraschino cherry, 
proved to be especially popular.
If your mama taught you to clean 
your plate, you will never walk 
away hungry from Sichuan House. 
The entrees, combined with the 
complementary steamed rice, are 
quite filling enough for one person, 
or even two if you have appetizers 
or small appetites. I may not be 
able to judge the authenticity of 
Chinese food, but I can certainly 
say that judging from the care paid 
to the cooking and the quality of 
the ingredients, this is the gourmet 
side of Chinese cuisine. In all, I'd 
say this is a nice restaurant to bring 
your parents or a date to, or to 
experience lots of good tastes by 
sharing several dishes with a few 
good friends. If my friend with the 
strong opinions about spelling can 
swallow his objections, I might 
even bring him back soon to get his 
opinion about Sichuan House's 
authenticity.
 LORELEI LAIRD
Suzies
Theres Greek food, and then 
theres Greek food. Most students 
are probably familiar with at least 
one takeout place that offers 
impressive gyros, souvlaki, and 
fries. All very tasty, but not the kind 
of place you want to show your par
ents when you want to prove that, 
yes, you are eating like an adult 
when youre at school.
Suzies, on the other hand, offers 
an altogether more elegant  not 
to mention less grease-laden  
Greek dining experience. The 
menu at this Squirrel Hill restau
rant is full of dishes that are unusu
al enough to be exotic, but not so 
weird that theyre in any danger of 
scaring anyone (i.e., Mom, Dad, or 
your picky little brother) away.
The dining room looks cheerful
and Mediterranean, with sunny 
yellow walls and watercolors of 
vaguely Greek-looking landscapes. 
The food itself suddenly becomes 
more fun when you notice that 
every plate seems to be painted in a 
different Crayola-bright color. Even 
the side of green beans and carrots 
that comes with every main course 
looks delicious when its on a 
vibrant blue plate. The classiness of 
the food and its presentation unfor
tunately show up in the prices. Its 
difficult to get a dinner under $10, 
and most run a few dollars more.
We ordered hummus to start, but 
it mysteriously never showed up 
(although it did appear on our bill, 
conveniently enough). Without 
hummus, we had to turn to the 
bread, which was not exactly a 
hardship considering that we got 
huge amounts of both pita rounds 
and an egg bread that tasted an 
awful lot like challah. Other than 
the missing hummus, service was 
reasonably prompt and friendly. 
They were even smart enough to 
leave a whole pitcher of Diet Coke 
on our table once they saw that we 
were hardly past the salad and 
already on our second round of 
drink refills.
Suzies salad, generously sprin
kled with bits of feta cheese, tastes 
so good you momentarily forget its 
a salad. Among main courses, pites
 assorted fillings inside phyllo 
dough  are some of the most 
interesting. Spanakopita, with 
spinach and cheese, tastes rich and 
eggy, although the portion could be 
larger. Its a very painless way to 
get your daily dose of iron. 
Exohiko, with lamb, is also good 
and filling.
Other dishes are also memo
rable. Chicken Apollo featured a 
mushroom filling and a creamy 
mustard sauce. The sauce tasted a 
little too generically creamy and 
not mustardy enough for me, but 
the flavors did go well together, 
and the chicken itself was tender.
Roast lamb was also succulent, 
with a tasty sauce.
I got entirely too excited when I  
heard that one of the dessert choic
es was homemade chocolate 
cheesecake. But it was worth it  
the slice I had had an intense flavor 
and grainy texture that raised it 
above mere mortal cheesecakes. 
The galatoboroureko looked like a " 
Greek egg roll, with sweet custard 
wrapped in a crisp pastry crust and 
the whole thing soaked in honey. 
Of course, theres baklava as well.
Your parents will definitely be 
impressed. If youre lucky, theyll 
even pay for your share of the meal.
 BECCA FRIBUSH
Sweet Basil
There comes a time in every stu
dents life where Gulliftys just 
wont do. As much as you love the 
giant wedgies and Killer Kookies at 
Gulliftys, you want somewhere 
different, somewhere classier, 
somewhere with live music rather 
than 80s tunes played over a loud
speaker. Sweet Basil is for that 
time.
Sweet Basil may be just blocks 
from ubiquitous Squirrel Hill stu
dent dining spots like Gulliftys and 
Eat n Park, but it feels far away. 
This upscale American restaurant 
is definitely a change of pace.
The menu encompasses food for 
every taste, from vegetarian sand
wiches or plain grilled chicken for 
the health-minded to fried ravioli 
topped with tomato sauce and egg
plant or burgers and fries for the 
non-diet-conscious. Whatever you 
order, dinner probably wont blow 
your budget too badly, with sand
wiches between $5.95 and $8.95 
and entrees from $7.95 to $13.95.
Sweet Basils elegance is appar
ent even from its exterior  all red 
brick with big windows and a cute 
little flag with the restaurants 
name on it. The dining room inside 
is light and airy, with framed pho
tographs arranged on its white 
walls. The pictures tend to be 
mainly of children being adorable 
and happy couples hugging in 
front of sunsets but, if you dont 
look at them for too long, you can 
still retain all of your appetite.
Which is good, because you dont 
want to miss the appetizers. We 
started off with spinach and arti
choke dip, which turned out to be 
delicious. We used warm pita chips 
to scoop up every last mouthful of 
the artichoke-studded dip, which 
seemed to incorporate as much 
cheese as spinach. Other good 
appetizers include the pizzeti and 
the pizza bread, both of which are 
variations on the theme of bread 
with vegetables and stuff on top.
The salads are also great. The 
side salad consists just of lettuce 
with shredded cheese and lots of 
red onions, but the freshness of the 
ingredients make it incredibly 
tasty, especially with the tangy 
basil vinaigrette dressing. Its 
worth ordering even if you dont 
get one with your meal.
Unfortunately, the main courses 
arent as uniformly good as the 
appetizers and salads. Most of 
them get some parts perfect and 
some parts less-than-perfect. For 
example, the dry beef in the beef 
brisket sandwich was partly coun
teracted by the yummy barbecue 
sauce. The fettuccine a la grecque
 with shrimp, chopped tomatoes, 
and olives  had a great mix of 
ingredients but was so oily that I 
considered finding a paper towel 
and blotting it. On the other hand, 
a Jacks Vegetarian sandwich  
tomatoes, sprouts, lettuce, onions, 
and cheese with poppy-seed dress
ing on whole-grain bread  was 
right on target except for being on 
the small side.
Whatever the shortcomings of 
your entre may be, Sweet Basil 
definitely has some nice non-food 
touches that help make up for 
them. Besides the attractive dining 
room, theres the musicians who 
occasionally pop up to play instru
mental jazz numbers and the 
attentive service.

HECERTAINLYIS.At first, no one would believe me. The "free" press went on a smear campaign, sullying my good name with sordid lies about my precious feces, as they had not been subjected to government scrutiny.
But one woman was man enough to try them out. Her name was Shagme Cambart, Operating Vice President of Campbart Soup Company. They said she was thirty-three years old and a good lay. They were right.
The company was lagging. Other products, novelty cereals and the like, were drastically reducing her market share. She 
needed to fight back, not through underhanded tactics but by creating a better product. Her secret weapon? The bold new taste of my rich, chocolaty 
feces. Just a hint made the soup savory and delicious.
After ten years of intense research, I managed to accomplish my task, to create a new kind of feces, which I named Jesus Excrement after our lord and savior. They were a beautiful shade of olive green, and they were both lighter and cheaper than their predecessors.

The newly reformulated products were introduced with great fanfare. No one could resist the satisfying new flavor. 
People wondered what was behind it, but Campbart wasn't about to reveal her proprietary recipe. But people trusted her, as her company was rich by its own profit, the only real metric by which one can measure value.
But a miracle happened, and the synthetic feces began to take on a new identity as the blood and body of Christ. Thus, over time, those who consumed the fated soup became less and less rational, more and more holy. Soon, laws were passed that prevented production of goods on Sundays, causing massive soup shortages and inducing widespread riots: looting, pillaging, the works

Dont go home when you can go to Homecoming
DO PITTSBURGH!
by Greg Nofi
Entertainment Editor
Whoa, mid-semester break is approaching quickly. If you plan on being in the cluster all week followed by a weekend at home with your parents, then this column isnt for you. If you want to have a little fun over the next two weeks and dont plan on leaving the city anytime soon, then here are your 10 cool things to do for the next two weeks in Pittsburgh.
 Earthware: its a word that may make some 
guys uneasy. After all, it sounds like some kind of 
trendy brand of china that their girlfriends or 
wives would buy from Crate and Barrel or Pottery 
Barn after seeing Rachel use it in Friends. But fear 
not, its not a dining set, its a symposium. 
Earthware: A good world in 2050. Will 
computers help or hinder? takes place this 
Thursday in McConomy Auditorium of the 
University Center. Theres going to be an all-star 
team of guests to speak on the issue, including 
Ray Kurzweil, Herbert A. Simon, and Raj Reddy. 
There will also be synthetic interviews with Bill 
Joy and Arthur C. Clarke. But the best part is that 
if youre a member of the campus community 
(either human or computer), this event is free.
For more information and registration, visit www.cs.cmu.edu/-earthware.
 You poor, misguided soul. You thought 
that just because you were wokking and 
rolling with your Chinese food at lunch in 
Newell-Simon Hall, the building surely 
must be open. Well, Im afraid youre incor
rect, little trooper. If you dont believe me, 
be in the Perlis Atrium at 5 pm on Thursday 
for the Ceremonial Opening of the 
building which houses many of the offices 
and research facilities of the Computer 
Science Department.
 Whenever some kind of large anniver
sary comes along, someone tries to impress 
others with his or her tremendous wit by 
saying, Hey, this event is so big, it only
happens once every ____years. I dont
want to be that guy. However, if you miss 
this Fridays Centennial Birthday Bash 
from 2 to 5 pm in Kirr Commons of the 
University Center, youll have to wait anoth
er 100 years for the Bicentennial. Im not 
cracking a joke, Im just giving you a fair 
warning, Besides, everyone who goes to 
Fridays bash gets a free gift.
 Carnegie Mellon just cant get enough 
of the blues, or at least bands that have

when I held you close like my son who fell into the

nights later.
I held you dark into the next morning 
Like a remembered life: 
the ending was so long ago.
You looked at me and asked
And I am ashamed, because I could not give it to you.
Suddenly I found myself staring down the most loving eyes I
have ever known
For some reason begging
(please) s
Don't make me go this way.
In the fog I took my heart and put it next to you, as an offering 
And I did not know 
I never did know your eyes;
I have not entered there.
I have not trampled the daisies on this particular path.
Green the ivy.
take me there gently, then,
and hold my hand.

in the backyard 
by mad merv
last night i buried my girlfriend in the backyard
in a brown glad baggie tied with the extra strong handles
that i paid an extra forty five cents for.
it was great, i got her in the kitchen with a big knife
and carved her like the thanksgiving turkey.
then Dahlmer style i found a good way to package her limbs.
i didnt do anything too crazy with the corpse
i aint no sicko.
but i did sing a happy little song while I did it.
and i feel no remorse
still.
it was a really great experience, i wholly recommend it. 
then i put on some old dirty bastard (who likes it raaaaaw) 
and shimmy-shimmy yaw shimmy-shimmy yea 
i went on my merry little way

Isn't this stupid?
Nobody likes us here, making 
our business everyone's business.
The waitress slammed an Iron City down
and I saw your nerves
forked over a distant plane like lightning.
I know under the tundra, frozen 
between sediment, your brain lies 
sleeping with the fossils of a spiritless day.
Our mouths made sounds lost to the jukebox.
this is something, this is fun. la la la.
this is what people do (a tired tradition
started god knows where by who knows who).
Your eyes looked down, waiting
for words on the floor to be
swept up into some poetic dustbin
that it was so simple, ai 
couldn't I be more sirni
fucking-something-o'clock 
I took a bar
to my magic eight-ball toy 
and made airborne 
sixteen useless answers - watered 
the neighbors chrysanthemums 
with definite possibilities, 
some better than others, 
but simple and right as rain.

The testing of Sally Henuningsancestral DNA, was used to confirm that Thomas Jefferson fathered at least

If I were a Surrealist
I would take black and white photographs of you naked; title them 
Pigdog with the caption "In Heat"-.
I would paint pictures of cockroaches using shit brindle and plum purple, 
title these Series on Steve.
I would create phallic sculptures from green tinker toys, call them Steve's 
Winkie: Enlarged to the Tenth Power.
But instead, as you have reminded me so many times, I am just a poet.
I can only flood the world with bitter words and images that have the 
aftertaste of a hangover.
I hope that you can't find any mouthwash.
