University looks to update campus athletic facilities
Former Black Panther

News Editor
At a university recently ranked as 
a top-25 college in the country, Carn
egie Mellon athletes must play in a 
gymnasium that its president calls 
substandard by any measure. Now, 
a new athletics director is looking to 
change that.
University President Jared Cohon 
made the aforementioned statement 
about Skibo Gymnasium last Tuesday 
in a statement to the campus com
munity. The official communication 
discussed new campus building proj
ects and explained the proposal to 
update the athletic facilities on cam
pus.
While no new building is in the 
works yet, architectural firm Hastings 
and Chivetta has scoped out the cam
pus over the last few weeks with a new 
structure in mind.
Having assumed her role in the Uni
versitys sports department last June, 
director of athletics and physical edu
cation Susan Bassett is spearheading 
this effort. According to Andrea Wesp, 
the assistant sports information direc
tor, Bassett envisions an upgrade to 
current facilities in the Department of 
Athletics, both far daily use and com
petition.
This project isnt intended to im
prove only the lives of varsity athletic 
members, Wesp stated, but to en
hance the lives of all students, alumni, 
faculty, and staff as viewing areas and 
working space could be improved.
In response to Bassetts ideas, 
Cohon authorized hiring the architects 
from Hastings and Chivetta to conduct 
a master planning study about the 
athletic facilities, according to the 
presidents official communication.
As Bassett noted, a planning 
oversight committee has drafted 
Athletics, Health and Wellness Vision 
Statement that will be referenced 
during the proposal process. The 
committee includes such faculty as 
Bassett, Dean of Student Affairs Jenni
fer Church, and Associate Vice-Provost 
for Campus Design Ralph Horgan.
According to Horgan, the master 
planning effort has three main goals: 
assessing the status of the existing 
facilities; determining the demand 
for athletics, health, and wellness fa
cilities; and developing a strategy for 
renovating or building new facilities to 
meet the current and future needs of 
the campus.
We have no set answers on the type, 
size, or location of facilities that will 
result, Horgan stated. The purpose 
of the planning process is to solicit 
inputs from all corners of the campus 
community in order to try to figure out 
those answers.
Through a donation by an alumnus, 
Hastings and Chivetta came to cam
pus twice this semester, first on March 
22-23 and again last week. During 
their first week, the architectural firm 
participated in a town-hall meeting 
regarding health and fitness on cam
pus. Last week, Hastings and Chivetta 
engaged in workshops with students, 
faculty, and staff.
The architectural firm also con
ducted a university-wide survey of 
need for a new facility that was posted

According to a new study, men and 
womens drinking cultures may be 
as different as moonshine and mar
garitas  even in situations where 
they drink together.
Researchers from the University 
of North Carolina at Wilmington 
(UNCW) are using this information to 
explore the efficacy of gender consid
erations for student alcohol education 
programs. Early results and an over
view of their program were presented 
at an annual meeting of the American 
College Personnel Association (ACPA) 
in Indianapolis, InsideHigherEd.com 
reported on March 22.
Wilmington experts found students 
to be significantly less likely to agree 
with the statement, Im more fun 
when Im drunk, after going through 
gender-based alcohol education pro- -Kristie Hall, 
grams when compared to students bartender
who had not.
At Wilmington, peer educators are not at
tempting to convince students that drinking is 
simply a terrible thing.
Were talking about gender much more than 
were talking about drinking. Its like were 
sneaking the alcohol [topic] in, said Aimee 
Hourigan to InsideHigherEd.com. Hourigan is 
the substance abuse prevention coordinator at
Girls have to do shots here before they go on the dance floor.
UNCWs CROSSROADS 
program. CROSSROADS 
is a substance abuse pre
vention and education 
program that attempts 
to utilize a positive, nonjudgmental message.
Carnegie Mellon is exploring the 
use of similar programs.
We are in the process of using 
the results of AlcoholEdu to create a 
campaign that would resemble a so
cial norms campaign. This means we 
will have information weve learned 
from AlcoholEdu, such as 48 per
cent of CMU students choose not 
to drink, instead of CMU students 
shouldnt drink, said Kristine M. 
Cecchetti, a health educator in Stu
dent Health Services.
AlcoholEdu for College is an 
online alcohol education course re
quired for first-years at Carnegie 
Mellon. The 48 percent of non
drinking Carnegie Mellon students 
is a statistic derived from Alco
holEdu results.
A few audience members at the 
ACPA meeting said that their in
stitutions were adopting a similar 
social norms approach to alcohol education. 
Early results from the Wilmington teams study 
demonstrated that this school of thought is more 
effective in impacting the frequency of binge 
drinking and the average number of drinks per 
session, reported InsideHigherEd.com.

University ranks top-25
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwriter
For the third year in a row, U.S. News 
and World Report's annual Americas 
Best Graduate Schools ranked Carn
egie Mellon as the 22nd-best national 
university. This year, however, both 
graduate business and engineering pro
grams received their highest rankings 
in almost a decade.
Factors in the ranking process
How did U.S. News assess the Carn
egie Mellon experience and spit out a 
number? According to Robert J. Morse 
and Samuel Flanigan, authors of the 
ranking methodology on USNews.com, 
undergraduate rankings are based on 
many factors both qualitative and quan
titative, including peer assessment, 
retention rate, faculty resources, student 
selectivity, financial resources, gradua
tion rate, and alumni giving rate.
Graduate school rankings are more 
subjective. While business and engi
neering rankings are based on expert 
opinions as well as statistical indicators, 
programs in sciences, social sciences, and 
humanities are based solely on the rat
ings of experts  deans and other faculty 
in the department judging the academic 
quality of their own programs on a scale 
from 1 to 5.
How to use the rankings
Does having the undergraduate and 
graduate department heads rate tjieir 
own programs create an unfair bias? Of 
course, said Ignacio Grossmann, former 
head of the department of chemical engi
neering and current director of the Center 
for Advanced Process Decision-Making.
But that is only one of the many biases 
that result from the ranking process.
In the past, there has been a bias to
wards larger schools, which makes it 
somewhat more difficult for us, he said.
Deb Magness, executive director of mar
keting and communications for the Tepper 
School of Business, agrees.

Applauded by a standing audience 
at the nights end, civil rights activist 
Elaine Brown, spoke candidly about 
the causes and consequences of racism 
in modern-day America last Monday.
The first and only woman to lead 
the Black Panther Party, which she did 
in 1974, Brown has since advocated 
blacks freedom as an author, lecturer, 
and musician.
We dont even like to talk about 
black oppression, she said of society 
in general.
Brown said that the black condi
tion is important, however, because 
African-Americans are unique and 
oppressed. Certain issues, including 
viewing immigrants as people able to 
find better lives in America, cant be 
resolved until black oppression is re
solved.
We have to see black peoples condi
tion today from a larger perspective, 
she said, noting the exceptional suc
cess of such stars as Oprah Winfrey 
and rap artist 50 Cent. Youre not go
ing to be Oprah.... Youre not going to 
be president.
Elaine Brown has adapted to 
the post-1960s civil rights move
ment, noted Johanna Fernandez, a 
post-doctoral fellow in the Center for 
Africanamerican Urban Studies and

After a semester-long hiatus, the 
student-run service SafeWalk is ready 
to do its job once again. Now backed 
by an executive board and a faculty 
advisor, SafeWalk was reactivated on 
March 27.
Since 1996, SafeWalk has provided
Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, 
and staff with a secure escort across 
campus from 10 pm to 2 am every 
night of the week.
Were really here to make the

Wei Wei Wang remembered
by Tiffany Yun
Managing Editor
Wei Wei Wang, a sophomore 
in economics, passed away last 
Wednesday from injuries she 
sustained in a car accident on 
Forbes Avenue.
She was fondly remembered 
in a service last Saturday near 
her hometown in New York.
Wei Wei was involved in 
many campus activities, in
cluding Asian-interest sorority 
Kappa Phi Lambda and Alpha 
Kappa Psi, a business frater
nity. She worked in the Office 
of International Education and 
was a cheerleader, a teaching 
assistant for Advanced Chinese, 
and a member of SIFE (Students 
In Free Enterprise).
I met Wei Wei our freshman 
year when she and I pledged
for Kappa Phi Lambda. She was 
very cheerful, sweet, and easy to 
talk to; we quickly became com
fortable with each other.
Last semester, she invited me 
over to her dorm and showed 
me her cheerleading uniform 
because she had just joined the 
team. She was very excited to 
pursue her interest in cheerlead
ing and told me she had many 
practices and games lined up. 
She didnt even seem to mind 
that they took up a lot of her 
time.
Wei Wei not only enjoyed 
cheerleading but she had a pas
sion for dance and step. Since 
her freshman year, she per
formed in shows such as One 
Night in Beijing and Culture 
Night. She also choreographed 
Kappa Phi Lambdas recent step 
performance in Greek Sing.
This Friday from 4:15 pm to
5:15 pm at the Main Stage of 
Carnival, Kappa Phi Lambda will 
present the step performance 
Wei Wei choreographed in honor 
of her spirit and passions for the 
things she enjoyed best.
Wang is remembered as having deep 
love for family and friends.

Bradford Yankiver
To all the parents, alumni, and friends 
from the Pittsburgh community who are 
visiting Carnegie Mellon this week, I 
would like to welcome you on behalf of 
The Tartan. This years Spring Carnival 
and the celebration of the School of 
Computer Sciences 50th anniversary 
are sure to be great fun.
To the hundreds of alumni who served 
on The Tartans staff, I extend a special 
welcome. The Tartan and a number of 
other publications on campus are host
ing a barbeque for their alumni and 
current staff. Please join us on Thursday, 
April 20, at 5 pm in Donner Ditch for 
lunch and good conversation. Also feel 
free to drop by your office: University 
Center Suite 314.
The Tartan is a mere six months away 
from its 100th birthday. And were 
working hard to get the publication in 
tip-top shape for the occasion. Im very 
proud to announce that, to mark our 
hundredth year, we will reintroduce 
home subscriptions, which will hit the 
post offices on August 28 with our 
Welcome Back Special Issue.
You can subscribe right now by log
ging on to our secure order form at 
www.thetartan.org/subscribe. You can 
also call our office at (412) 268-2111 to 
subscribe by phone. The cost is $37.50 
for one year, and youll receive 26 issues 
of The Tartan, including the Carnival 
and Commencement special issues.
Whether youre an alum, the parent 
of a Carnegie Mellon student, a mem
ber of the Pittsburgh community, or 
a trustee of the University, theres no 
better way to feel like youre on campus 
every week than having a hard copy 
of The Tartan in your hands. By sub
scribing, youll also be supporting The 
Tartan as we begin our second century 
of publishing Carnegie Mellons first 
and only student-run newspaper.
This week is undoubtedly students 
favorite week. It marks the beginning 
of our countdown to summer. Once 
Spring Carnival comes, there are only 
two weeks of classes and two weeks of 
finals standing between us and summer 
freedom  at least until our summer 
jobs, internships, or classes begin.
But more than that, Spring Carnival 
is the embodiment of Carnegie Mellons 
school spirit.
Ive heard too many people complain 
about a lack of school spirit at this insti
tution. Frankly, I dont buy it.
Where else do you see a community 
devote so much of itself to creating an 
event like Spring Carnival? Thousands 
of man-hours go into building the 
booths on Midway. Thousands of hours 
are dedicated to Buggy engineering and 
training for Sweepstakes. It is an unde
niable extension of Carnegie Mellons 
uniquely intense work ethos. And thats 
what makes it ours.
Spring Carnival is one of our oldest 
traditions. Dating back to 1914, Spring 
Carnival was first dubbed May Day, 
before taking the name Campus Week 
by 1920. Campus Week marked the first 
year of Buggy races, which one witness 
called a conglomeration of rain bar
rels with bicycle wheels, four-wheeled 
orange crates, and three-wheeled ash 
cans. In 1930, Campus Week was re
vamped and renamed Spring Carnival, 
as we know it today.
Everyone will acknowledge that 
Carnegie Mellon is a unique place, so 
its natural that we would express our 
school spirit differently from, say, a 
Division I school. If you keep that in 
mind youll see it for yourself.
Come Thursday afternoon, thou
sands of people  current students, fac
ulty, alumni, parents, and Pittsburghers 
 will be swept into the effervescent 
buzz of Spring Carnival. That, I say, is 
school spirit.

SafeWalk returns to Carnegie Mellon after last semester's hiatus
SAFEWALK, from Al
SafeWalks executive director.
The programs problems be
gan two years ago, when senior 
chemical major Ann Shchelokova and three other volunteers 
were in charge of SafeWalk, with 
dean Jennifer Church in an advi
sory role.
After a semester, Shchelokova found herself running the 
program alone, and began 
strengthening the programs 
foundation. By the spring semes
ter of last year, the program was 
finally successful again.
It was one of the best semes
ters SafeWalk had, Shchelokova
stated in an e-mail. We had 
at least three volunteers every 
night.
Eventually Shchelokova no 
longer felt like she could carry the 
weight of an entire organization 
on her shoulders. One person 
was not enough, she stated.
Changes in leadership led to 
the time off. During the hiatus, 
the new faculty advisor Rahmon 
Hart, student development co
ordinator, recruited Mullican. 
Other recruits included junior 
electrical and computer engi
neering major Dan Horbatt as 
public relations director and 
sophomore chemistry major 
Suvana Hashim as scheduling
director.
We function as a group so that 
no one of us is carrying the whole 
team, Mullican said.
With stable leadership that 
promises continuity, Mullican 
hopes to also make a change in 
SafeWalks approach to record
keeping.
Ideally, we will be keeping 
track of users Andrew IDs so that 
we can get some feedback, Mul
lican said. Right now, SafeWalk 
volunteers keep track of names, 
times, and places of pick up and 
drop off in log booklets.
Now, the next step is getting 
the word out for volunteers and 
for the service itself. Most of
the current volunteers were re
cruited by word of mouth.
Since a lot of them are our 
friends, we can attest to their 
non-sketchiness, Horbatt said, 
noting more help is needed.
Mullican said that, as of 
now, he just requests that volun
teers stay for the full four-hour 
shift.
Students are already awake 
at all hours of the night at Carn
egie Mellon, and its great to see 
them coming together in order to 
benefit the community, Hashim 
said.
SafeWalk is currently located 
in the Scotland Yard game room 
of the. University Center base
ment, but according to Mullican 
will soon be moving outside of 
Andys, also in the UC base
ment. Each shift requires three 
volunteers: one taking calls on 
dispatch, and two walkers.
Walkers are each given a Whis
tle, a cell phone, and an official 
SafeWalk badge for the trek they 
both make.
We want enough volunteers 
so that we can have one male 
and one female walker per shift, 
Mullican said. That way there 
wont be any issues with the call
ers comfort levels.
Volunteer Reid Barnett, a 
first-year mathematical sciences 
major, recently walked a student
from the library back to her offcampus apartment. I thought 
it was a positive experience and 
that students are more comfort
able walking with other students 
than with campus police, he 
said.
For SafeWalk volunteers, 
the organizations future looks 
bright: I feel that once more 
people find out about it, the ser
vice will become much more 
useful, Barnett said.
SafeWalk can be reached from
10 pm to 2 am every night of the 
week at x8-SAFE. Students inter
ested in volunteering should con
tact Ben Mullican at safewalk@ 
andrew. emu. edu.

RANKINGS, from A1
[The rankings] present a 
skewed view of whats important 
in your academic experience, 
she said. We live in a society 
of lists and ranks. She recom
mends a healthy respect that 
rankings are here to stay, while 
cautioning, Dont use rankings 
as a shortcut.
Theres no such thing as one 
best school, and [U.S. News] 
does a disservice to students by 
putting such an emphasis on that 
misconception, Magness said.
Even U.S. News is aware of the 
confusion that its rankings can 
incite.
We want to help you with 
the [program selection] process 
by giving you an independent 
assessment of the academic 
quality of the programs in 
your field, USNews.com states. 
However, the website also 
maintains that the rankings 
can inform your thinking  but 
they wont hand you an easy 
answer.
HSw did Carnegie Mellon rank?
Business
According to U.S. News, Carn
egie Mellons Tepper School of 
Business is ranked in 16th place 
overall on the graduate level, its 
highest since it was ranked 15th 
in 1998.
In U.S. Newss 2006 edition 
of Americas Best Colleges, 
Tepper ranked fifth on the under
graduate level, its highest score 
since 2001, when it received 
another fifth-place ranking. 
However, the school was ranked 
second overall by The Wall Street 
Journals 2005 business school 
rankings, which are based on the 
views of corporate recruiters.
Recruiters say that Tepper 
graduates have the ability to hit 
the ground running, and other 
students take longer to orient 
themselves in the workplace, 
Magness said. We are a top-10 
school when it comes to starting 
salary and job placement.
She cites teamwork, analyti
cal, and decision-making skills 
as attributes of Tepper grads that 
particularly stand out to recruit
ers. She credits the acquisition 
of these skills to the small size of 
the school and favorable facultyto-student ratio.
However, the U.S. News rank
ings, based more on teaching 
and student satisfaction, can 
make Tepper appear to come up 
short on the academic side. Mag
ness disagrees.
Our academic experience is 
in ways unparalleled and com
petitive, Magness said. In fact, 
she attributes Teppers fourspot climb in the BusinessWeek 
2004 rankings to the significant

rise in student satisfaction. The name out there,said Erin Domagazine named Tepper as one 
of the most improved schools 
in 2005.
Engineering
Engineering has seen the most 
significant progress in the rank
ings, currently ranking eighth 
on the graduate level. This is 
its highest ranking since 1998, 
when it was ranked fourth.
Last year, undergraduate en
gineering also ranked eighth, for 
the fourth year in a row:
Grossmann attributed the suc
cess to the departments balance 
of research and teaching.
I think that while were 
regarded as a strong research de
partment, we place an emphasis 
on education, he said. Its our 
responsibility to teach and [to] 
teach well.
While professors have to 
juggle research and teaching, 
it is the research that often 
motivates their students. This 
factor, Grossmann believes, gives 
Carnegie Mellon a comparative 
advantage over competing 
teaching universities in the 
engineering field that lack the 
research component.
Computer Science
As it has fairly consistently 
for the past 15 years, Carnegie 
Mellons graduate program in 
computer science ranked first 
overall in the nation. U.S. News 
cited its particularly strong spe
cialties as artificial intelligence, 
programming languages, and 
systems, all of which ranked in 
the top three.
Humanities
Research is a component in 
the humanities, too.

nahoe, the graduate programs 
coordinator for the psychology 
department, which was ranked 
ninth overall on the graduate 
level.
She cites the other factors in 
Carnegie Mellons competitive
ness as the substantial federal 
grants the department receives, 
allowing the school to offer its 
students free tuition as well as a 
living stipend, and the small size 
of its department  the psychol
ogy program only accepts eight 
to 10 students per year.
Fine Arts
The Master of Fine Arts (MFA) 
program at Carnegie Mellon 
is ranked 10th in the nation. 
In addition, its graduate 
programs in graphic design, 
industrial design, and multi
media/visual communication 
placed sixth, third, and second, 
respectively.
These rankings are consistent 
with the 2004 rankings in this 
category. Drama was not ranked 
this year, according to Theresa 
Thomas, Carnegie Mellons as
sistant vice-president for media 
relations.
Diversity
Academics are not the only 
aspect of universities across the 
country that news magazines 
rank.
While Carnegie Mellon ranked 
ninth in economic diversity, it 
ranked 35th in financial aid: 
Last year, less than half of its 
students who needed grants re
ceived them.
In addition, while the school 
was seventh in international di
versity, with 12 percent of the 
student body being international 
students, it did not even make the 
list of racially diverse schools. 
The admissions office did not 
comment on these matters.Brown explores New Age racism
BROWN, from A1
the Economy (CAUSE) and a fac
ulty member in the history de
partment.
In order for her to be a leader 
of the Black Panther Party, she 
had to be a woman of the mo
ment, she said.
Brown talked at length about 
Michael Little B Lewis, a 14- 
year-old tried for murder as an 
adult in Georgia in 1997. It is 
incidental that she believes he 
didnt commit the crime, she 
said. The main point was that a 
14-year-old boy was placed on 
trial as an adult.
In her book New Age Racism 
and the Condemnation of Little 
B, Brown tells Lewis story  
a boy ignored by his community, 
misrepresented by the media, 
and convicted of a crime she 
doesnt think he committed.
Whats more interesting 
about Little B for me is not that
he was charged for a crime and 
convicted, Brown said. The 
other piece was his life.
According to Brown, blacks 
have the highest poverty rates, 
lowest employment rates, and 
lowest income rates. We still 
have ghettos in America, dont 
we? But we pretend that we 
dont, she said.
Brown used the term New 
Age racism to describe the 
attribution of blacks condi
tion to a problem with blacks 
themselves, rather than with 
America. She claimed that in 
the 1920s, Columbia Univer
sity sponsored an investigation 
into the existence of a supposed 
African-American criminal gene. 
Theres no criminal gene, she 
said. This whole business is a 
myth.
Brown also faulted American 
history for blacks current con
dition. America is so powerful 
that you have to ask yourself:
How did it happen?
The only crime that we could 
commit was trying to be free, 
she said. I would assert that 
America has become hell for mil
lions of people.
In addition to speaking at 
universities about racism and 
gender oppresion, Brown serves 
as a board member of the Na
tional Alliance for Radical Prison 
Reform, according to Wisconsin 
Green Party News.
Turning to students, Brown 
hopes they act now and connect 
with one another to discuss ra
cial issues. Fernandez agreed 
that students have lots of time 
and resources at their disposal. 
Their job is to understand social 
phenomena, and, historically, 
students have headed many so
cial movements, she said.
Students have a powerful 
moment, Brown said. This is 
your moment; you are the best; 
you hold the banner.
Drinking differs between genders
GENDER, from A1
The social norms school of 
thought is a teaching method 
developed by the National So
cial Norms Resource Center at 
Northern Illinois University. 
This model for alcohol education 
accepts student drinking and 
emphasizes moderation over 
complete sobriety.
The Wilmington presenta
tion was titled Men drink 
beer, women drink liquor, 
and engaged the audience. 
InsideHigherEd.com reported 
that audience members agreed 
with the idea behind the title and 
recognized a key implication of 
this statement: Women drinking 
mixed drinks will have a harder 
time keeping track of liquor con
sumption due to the variable
 potencies, whereas men can 
simply count beers.
Girls drink fruity drinks; guys 
just drink beer. And more, said 
Eugene DePasquale, longtime 
bartender and owner of the Pan
ther Hollow Inn (PHI) on Forbes 
Avenue in Oakland.
Guys are more prone to do 
something more dangerous than 
they would already do. With 
girls, its whats happening all 
around them thats more danger
ous, said DePasquale.
A new twist on regular pro
gram activities, Hourigan ex
plained, might involve discussion
among women about why they 
should feel comfortable with 
their sexuality when sober, not 
just when drunk.
Local bartenders agreed with 
this trend.
Girls have to do shots here 
before they go on the dance 
floor, said Kristie Hall, a bar
tender and waitress at Peters 
Pub on Oakland Avenue in Oak
land.
Girls drink fruity 
drinks; guys just

While AlcoholEdu does not 
have two different versions for 
men and women, it does outline 
the differences in experience by 
gender, according to Cecchetti.
Alcohol issues associated with 
gender are especially important 
here at CMU, where we have a 
larger male population than fe
male, Cecchetti said.
AlcoholEdu takes a look at the 
physical differences between 
men and women in terms of 
hormones and body types, 
and the different effects on 
socializing are detailed. Many 
students cite the ability to social
ize easier as a reason to drink, 
and men may do it as a way to 
look manly.
According to Cecchetti, see
ing women compete with other 
women in regards to how much 
they can drink is more rare; 
however, its becoming more 
and more common to see women 
competing with men, such as 
girls against boys in a game of 
beer pong.
If a man drinks heavily, it 
makes him seem more mascu
line. If a woman drinks heavily, 
it makes her seem less feminine, 
Cecchetti said.
Another difference in the male 
and female drinking cultures that 
is explored by both AlcoholEdu 
and UNCWs CROSSROADS pro
gram is sexual assault.
In sexual assault cases, the 
more drunk a man is, the less he 
is often considered responsible. 
The more drunk a woman is, the 
more responsible she is consid
ered, Cecchetti said, referring 
to the amount of blame placed 
on an intoxicated male assaulter 
versus the intoxicated female 
victim.
Hall described the status quo 
differently.
If youre a girl and ... you get 
sloppy and touchy-feely, youre a 
slut, he said. If the guy gets like 
that, hes a scumbag, but people 
still dont mind him  he is still 
'going home with Someone.
Athletics may acquire new home
ATHLETICS, fromAl
Saturday, March 18. By the fol
lowing Tuesday at noon, over 
1800 students and faculty had 
responded, according to Bas
sett.
Hastings and Chivetta are 
currently analyzing the results, 
which reached a total greater 
than 2000 before the survey 
closed in late March.
The idea is to have a facility 
that will support all avenues of 
the athletic department, Wesp 
said, citing such amenities as 
office space, team rooms and 
locker rooms for each sport, and
space for each intramural (IM) 
sport. Currently, Wesp noted, IM 
sports share'the same space as 
varsity teams, making schedul
ing complicated.
Wesp also cited the need for a 
better gymnasium competitive 
with those in our athletic confer
ence affiliation and nationwide.
Built in 1924, Skibo Gymna
sium is one the oldest college 
athletic facilities still in use, ac
cording to sports information 
director Mark Fisher. Carnegie 
Mellon is academic-[focused]
 and it should be, he said. But 
outside of that, we need to look 
into [a new gymnasium] to compete with peer universities.
Though the process is still in 
infant stages of planning, Cohon 
has planned the financial back
ing for the outcome.
We do not have the money 
to build a new athletic facility, 
nor do we have any plans for 
additional borrowing  for this 
purpose, he stated in his official 
communication. My interactions 
with alumni... indicate there are 
many who would like to give sub
stantially for new athletic facili
ties. Our intention, therefore, is 
to use the results of this planning 
process to help us raise funds for 
such facilities.

Hot-water worms
Researchers at Harvard have 
discovered a species of worm 
that lives in the hottest water on 
earth, near undersea hot water 
vents where the temperature is 
between 122 and 131 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Researchers believe 
the worms feed, unopposed by 
any other species, on the bacteria 
that thrive in high tempera
tures. Not only can these worms 
live in such extreme conditions, 
they prefer them. Temperature 
gradient experiments showed 
the worms quickly migrating to 
hotter water.

The science behind 
violence revealed
Scientists at the National 
Institutes of Mental Health 
are researching the biology 
behind aggressive behavior. 
Stress-inducing images, such as 
angry faces and guns pointed to
ward the viewer, were shown to 
100 healthy volunteers. People 
with angrier reactions showed 
increased activity in the amyg
dala, the region of the brain that 
detects danger, but less activity 
in the cingulate cortex, which is 
believed to deal with aggression. 
This finding may help uncover

Buhl lecture 
reveals new 
technology
Worlds most 
powerful X-ray 
laser to be built
by Sean Conroy
Staffwriter
Keith Hodgson of Stanford 
University flew to Pittsburgh 
last Monday to deliver the Buhl 
Lecture at Carnegie Mellon, 
an annual physics presenta
tion held at the Mellon Insti
tute. The lecture was about the 
emergence of a new technology 
that will enable detection of 
atomic transitions and chemical 
reactions that take place on the 
order of femtoseconds.
Hodgson is the director of 
Stanfords LINAC Coherent 
Light Source (LCLS) project 
and is in the process of build
ing the worlds most powerful 
X-ray laser. Yet for all its power, 
the purpose of the laser is not to 
explode molecules, but to take 
pictures of them before the ex
plosion. In 2009, Hodgson and 
his team at the Stanford LINAC
 short for Linear Acceleration 
Centerwill fire a 10-gigawatt 
photon beam into a single mol
ecule and take a picture before 
it explodes.
Coincidentally, Stanford 
Universitys founder was also 
interested in high-speed pho
tography. In 1872, Leland 
Stanford hired photographer 
Eadweard Muybridge to con
firm his belief that all four 
hooves of a galloping horse 
leave the ground together. Us
ing tricks very clever for 1872, 
the photographer was able to 
take short enough exposures to 
confirm Stanfords belief.
Hodgsons goal is the same, 
but on a different scale. He 
hopes to use the laser to take 
pictures so fast that he can see 
the motion of atoms.
To learn about the properties 
of atoms, one needs photons of 
comparably small wavelength. 
A typical atom diameter is one 
tenth of one billionth of a me
ter. While the wavelength of 
visible light is over 1000 times 
too large for such imaging, the 
wavelength of an x-ray is just 
right.

Lub-dub, lub-dub is the 
sound of the heart pumping 
five liters of blood throughout 
the body every minute. Many 
people take it for granted that 
their hearts beat well and prop
erly, allowing them to live their 
daily lives without fatigue. 
There are many people, how
ever, whose hearts do not beat 
on track. Luckily, todays tech
nology can correct for this and 
allow any person with an irreg
ular heartbeat to live a healthy 
life.
A persons irregular heart
beat can be corrected by 
a pacemaker, an electrical de
vice surgically inserted in the 
heart. How can a man-made 
device possibly work with a 
human heart to correct for 
irregularities?
The heartbeat is caused by 
electrical impulses generated by 
the heart. The impulse triggers 
the heart muscle to contract in 
a coordinated manner. If the 
electrical signal is not signaled 
properly, cardiac arrhythmias 
occur. These are irregularities 
in the force or rhythm of the 
heartbeat. A normal heart beats 
60 times per minute on average. 
Irregular heart beats, however, 
can either be too fast or too 
slow. Bradycardia is the condi
tion of a slower heart rate and
loss of consciousness, and even 
death in some cases.
The implantation of a 
pacemaker into a patient is 
considered a minor surgery. 
Complications may occur, as 
with all surgeries. These in
clude bleeding and infection. 
In the case of severe bleeding, 
a blood transfusion can take 
place, while infection can be 
treated quickly and effectively 
with antibiotics.
After being surgically
inserted into the body,
pacemakers must be 
checked once or twice each 
year in order to ensure it is 
normally functioning. Long
after implantation, a person 
can experience generator failure 
or lead failure. Both conditions 
are rare, but can occur because 
of manufacturer error.
Equipment and instruments 
that generate powerful mag
netic fields, such as medical 
devices and industrial motors, 
can interfere with the perfor
mance of pacemakers. MRI 
scans and radiation therapy 
are extremely unfavorable for 
people with pacemakers; there
fore, it is important to have the 
pacemaker shielded from the 
radiation.
Pacemakers are but one 
example of recent technologi
cal advancements that have 
allowed many people an 
improved quality of life.

How Things Work: Pacemakers

Honda CBR600 motorcycle engine. They will compete in the Formula SAE, a premier international car racing event.
tachycardia is the condition of a 
faster heart rate.
In order to correct for these 
irregularities, an electrical de
vice known as a pacemaker can 
be inserted in the heart. The 
electrical signals that are sent 
down the cardiac muscle cause
for the heart. If the heart is not 
being electrically stimulated in 
the right way, the pacemaker 
steps in and corrects it. Most 
pacemakers are designed to 
correct bradycardias.
How exactly does an electri
cal device fix an irregular heart
beat? Pacemakers are made up 
of two major parts: the genera
tor and the lead. The generator 
is a tiny computer, a battery, 
and a lithium container. The 
batterys lifetime is six or seven 
years, and the generator is the 
size of a half-dollar coin. The 
lead is a flexible electrical wire. 
One end is attached to the gen
erator and the other end travels 
inside a vein into the heart. A 
lead attaches to the heart to 
detect its electrical activity. 
The lead then sends that infor
mation to the generator, which 
determines, by analyzing the 
input information, whether an 
electrical impulse must be pro
duced to correct for an irregular 
heartbeat.
If the heart rate is too slow, 
a tiny electrical signal is trans
mitted that stimulates the heart 
muscle to contract. Pacemak
ers also maintain coordination 
between the atria and the 
ventricles, the upper and lower 
compartments of the heart.

person whose heart beats

independent suspensions sit at all

power output is estimated to be 
about 80 horsepower and, with a

Avian flu virus continues its flight west
by George Diabes
Junior Staffwriter
Since its discovery in South
east Asia in 1997, Europe and the 
Americas have given relatively 
little attention to the avian flu, 
or H5N1 virus. Now, however, 
with a confirmed case in the 
United Kingdom, the Americas 
have a new-found concern 
over this potentially serious 
pandemic.
British officials have an
nounced that a swan was found 
dead on March 30 in eastern 
Scotland. The bird tested posi
tive for the H5N1 virus, making 
it the first reported case of the 
avian flu in the United Kingdom. 
The UK is now part of a growing 
list of countries in Europe with 
reported outbreaks.
In hope of preventing the 
spread of the virus, British 
officials have established a 1.8- , 
mile-radius protection zone sur
rounding the site of the infected 
swan. Officials feel that they are 
adequately prepared to deal with 
this issue, having met on April 
6 with the health and environ
ment department and Scottish 
officials. They discussed safety 
measures that should be imple
mented, including a plan to deal 
with this possible pandemic.
The greatest fear facing the 
UK is the possible virus transfer 
from waterfowl to domesticated 
poultry. If this occurrs, drastic 
measures will need to be taken 
to quarantine infected areas to 
maintain control over the spread 
of the virus and attempt to limit 
panic among the population.
A 965-square-mile surveil
lance zone has been established 
throughout the UK to moni
tor bird activity and migratory 
patterns, which includes 175 
poultry f^rms with over 3.1 
million birds.
A recent study by Carnegie 
Mellon University expresses a 
pessimistic outlook on the avian 
flus consequences if it reaches 
the United States. Nineteen 
medical experts and researchers 
from the departments of Social 
and Decision Sciences and En
gineering and Public Policy held
a meeting where they predicted 
a less than one percent chance 
that the U.S. will have adequate 
stockpiles of vaccines or antivi
ral drugs to prevent a pandemic 
within the next three years.
Although the experts believe 
that there is only a 15 percent 
chance that the H5N1 virus will 
mutate into a strain that can be 
transferred via human-to-human 
contact, the consequences of such 
a mutation would be devastating. 
The worst-case scenario would 
be that six million people would 
die in the United States and 180 
million would die worldwide.
Baruch Fischhoff, one of the 
authors of the study and a How
ard Heinz Professor, stated that 
the medical experts estimates 
suggest this is a bigger risk than 
anything else we are facing. 
Nevertheless, experts agreed 
that the best way to lessen the 
risk of a widespread pandemic 
in the U.S. is to maintain height
ened sanitary measures and re
main vigilant of global patterns 
as the virus spreads to other re
gions.
Human contraction of the 
H5N1 virus is believed to 
stem from contact with wild

waterfowl who act as carriers of 
the virus. Domesticated poultry 
tend to be much more suscepti
ble to the virus and can contract 
it from contact with waterfowl. 
Humans can contract the virus 
through contact with saliva, 
nasal excretions, and feces of 
infected birds. The virus has 
originated and spread so rapidly 
in southeast Asia due to crowded 
conditions where humans and 
poultry tend to live in close 
proximity to one another. This 
provides the virus with ideal 
conditions to mutate and infect 
the human population. Fur
thermore, migratory birds that 
carry the virus can consequently 
spread the virus to distant 
regions.
With new outbreaks being 
reported throughout Europe, 
it becomes more likely that the 
avian flu will reach the Americas 
and become a great concern 
to the United States. Although 
widespread use of vaccines will 
not be an option to combat the 
spread of the virus, preventa
tive tactics being implemented 
by British officials can also be 
used by other countries in hope 
of containing outbreaks.
University Center Allocation Board Space Proposal

LCLS to detect ultra-small particles
PHYSICS, from A4
length of the LCLS photons need 
to be very short, the time scale 
of the photon burst must be ex
tremely fast and intense. Finally, 
the photon beam should be 
coherent, meaning that the pho
tons are all polarized in parallel.
The new X-ray laser will 
be based on Stanfords threekilometer linear accelerator, the 
worlds longest and highest-energy electron linear accelerator. 
Short, intense bunches of elec
trons will be injected into the 
accelerator and then passed 
through compressors, which 
pack them into even shorter 
bunches. The electrons are then 
excited (energized) as they pass 
through an undulator magnet, 
where they emit X-ray radiation 
as they oscillate in the alternat
ing magnetic field.
To fully comprehend the 
capability of this machine, its 
important to understand the 
meaning behind the phrase or
der of magnitude. One order of 
magnitude denotes a scale factor 
of 10. The LCLS will be 15 or
ders of magnitude brighter than 
our sun. And while ordinary 
lasers emit about 1012 photons 
per second, the LCLS will emit 
that many photons in a single 
femtosecond. There are about as
many femtoseconds in a minute 
as there are minutes in the entire 
history of the universe.
The powerful combination 
 an X-ray beam with extreme 
brightness (a trillion X-rays in a 
needle-thin beam), short wave
length (on the scale of atoms), 
and short pulse duration (a few 
femtoseconds)  makes the 
LCLS a revolutionary machine, 
stated Hodgson in an e-mail.
A great many scientific discov
eries will be possible with the 
LCLS. Many atomic transitions 
and chemical reactions take place 
on the order of femtoseconds, and 
the ability to image such a pro
cess will likely lead to something 
Hodgson calls femtochemistry. 
It takes 10 femtoseconds for a 
hydrogen atom to attach itself to 
a molecule. A valence electron 
completes an orbit of its nucleus 
in about one femtosecond, while 
a gas molecule can move about 
one angstrom in a few femtosec
onds. Thus, with the LCLS, many 
physical events that until now 
could only be theorized about 
can now be experimentally 
observed.
The LCLS has tremendous 
discovery potential, Hodgson 
stated. Im personally most 
excited about the potential to 
image at or near atomic reso
lution non-periodic materials,
including single large biomole
cules. If the LCLS single molecule 
imaging experiments work as 
expected, it will really give us a 
completely new approach to im
aging on the atomic scale.
Given the extreme intensity 
of the X-ray laser, brighter than 
a quadrillion suns, anything 
the beam encounters will be 
destroyed. Since the pulse is so 
brief, it will hopefully be able to 
image its target before the target 
explodes.
The U.S. Department of Energy 
has given approval for construc
tion to begin, and Hodgson 
hopes for a completion date in 
late 2008 and operation by 2009. 
However, this new technology is 
not unknown to researchers in 
other countries, and according to 
Hodgson* the Japanese and the 
Europeans are getting on board 
and are planning even more ag
gressive programs.
For the time being, Hodgson 
and colleagues are very opti
mistic about this new technique. 
We are fortunate to be leading 
the world in this field, he said. 
Only when we gain full access 
to this remarkable light source 
in 2009 will we really begin to 
explore and understand their 
potential. But with some con
fidence, one can predict a new 
revolution in X-ray science.

17 April 2006 THE TARTAN
Remember when Starbucks 
pimped coffee, not culture?
Too many mouths to feed
Joint Funding Committee makes a travesty of the budget process; heres how they can improve
The student government of Carnegie 
Mellon University distributes nearly $1 
million per year in student money Of 
course, when theres less than enough 
money to go around, some organiza
tions members are bound to end up 
unsatisfied. But theres good reason to 
be genuinely disappointed, even angry, 
about the way student government doles 
out the dough.
Money is distributed by an organiza
tion called the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC). The committee is composed of 
representatives from the Undergradu
ate Student Senate and the Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA). All organiza
tions requesting money have to submit 
a budget detailing the amount of and 
reason for each proposed expense and 
a projection for each proposed revenue. 
The JFC then trims the budgets where 
they see fit. Organizations have a chance 
to appeal the JFCs recommendations, 
and then recommended budgets are sent 
to Senate and GSA for approval.
Its an arduous and thankless job. The 
members of the JFC give hour after hour 
trying to do whats best for the student 
body. Their work is invaluable. But no 
matter how dedicated they are, their rec
ommendations will be inherently flawed 
until they solve a number of systemic 
problems that cripple their work.
Problem: Thy will be not done
The most significant problem affecting 
the JFC is having  or at least taking into 
consideration  far too little informa
tion.
Around 8500 students pay the $82- 
per-semester student activity fee, yielding 
$1.4 million each year. Of that, just shy 
of $1 million is directed to more than 125 
student organizations via the JFC. But 
the JFC has no mechanism for making an 
accurate assessment of what the student 
body wants.
In theory, student money would be 
allocated so that students would end up 
with as much utility as possible. Natu
rally, different students want different 
things, and thats why JFC has to figure 
out how much to give each organization. 
Theres one major problem: JFC has no 
idea what students want.
Recommendation: Research rather 
than assumptions
The JFC must do empirical research or 
fund a group to do it for them. They need 
to know what sorts of groups, activi
ties, projects, and events students value. 
The Tartan recently completed a pilot 
study to examine this very issue. Our 
study suggests that the JFCs assump
tions about what students value may 
have resulted in a misallocation of tens 
of thousands of dollars last year. Direct
ing as little as $1000 toward thought
ful surveying of the student body could 
minimize such errors.
For example, the 46 randomly selected 
students who responded to The Tartans 
survey indicated they felt strongly that 
more money should go to community 
service organizations and intellectual 
organizations  such as the business 
associations, AB Lectures, AB Political 
Speakers, and the astronomy club. On 
the other hand, respondents said they 
would allocate significantly less money 
to Carnival and Sweepstakes-related 
activities. The results of the pilot survey 
showed a number of other potential mis
alignments between what students value 
and where their money goes. A link to 
the full results of our pilot study is now 
available online at www.thetartan.org.
If nothing else, the results of our initial 
study suggest that it would be valuable to 
invest sufficient resources into learning 
more about what the student body truly 
values. Instituting an annual survey, with 
the appropriate design, implementation, 
and statistical analysis, would most ef
fectively accomplish this goal.
Problem: Tunnel vision
JFC does not take into account how 
much money goes toward different types 
of activities  at least, not in a meaning
ful way. But as caretakers of the students 
money JFC members need to look at 
the bigger picture, and not just allocate 
money based on historical investments 
and thats the way things are done 
mentalities.
Recommendation: Macro-analysis of 
budgeting
For the JFC to have a sense of how 
theyre allocating money overall, their 
budget tracking information system  
which is already a vast improvement over 
the spreadsheets of the past  should 
keep growing to serve them better.
First, groups need to be better cat
egorized. As it stands, student organiza
tions determine their own category, but 
many end up filed arbitrarily. Also, a 
groups specific line items in one expense
 like AB Concerts and AB Comedys
Spring Carnival expenses  should all 
be attributed to a different category than 
the parent organization.
Proper grouping will allow the infor
mation system to quickly calculate how 
much the JFC intends to allocate to each 
category of student organization. For 
example, it would have shown that arts 
organizations, such as The Frame, Scotch 
n Soda, and The Originals, were granted 
4.55 percent of the overall 2005-2006 
budget, but the same organizations are 
slated to receive 5.48 percent of the 
2006-2007 budget. The JFC could also 
see if their cuts are evenly distributed 
across the categories or if theyve cut 
budgets of certain sizes more severely 
than budgets of other sizes, as was the 
case during last years funding process.
The ability to quickly assess the overall 
status of their allocations will give the 
JFC greater insight into how their alloca
tions will shape the overall experience of 
the student body.
Problem: No evaluation of budgeting 
quality or program effectiveness
As it stands, JFC over-allocates to many 
organizations. Groups get greedy and ask 
for more money than they have the time 
or initiative to spend. Tens of thousands 
of dollars go unspent each year.
Amazingly, funding decisions are 
made without regard for how well orga
nizations used their money in the past. 
That is, JFC does not perform any assess
ment of how well the organization used 
its money the year before or the year 
before that. An organization that spends 
only $500 of the $1500 it requested 
can request $1500 again and the JFC 
wouldnt notice.
If all the unspent money  sometimes 
as much as $50,000 in a single year
 were properly allocated, it could alle
viate the dissatisfaction of many groups 
who genuinely would have made good 
use of more money.
Recommendation: Consider where the 
money goes
The JFC. can easily request copies of 
every returning organizations finances 
and compare  even if only on a cur
sory level  the amount budgeted and 
the amount actually spent on various 
items. This is something that the JFC can 
implement without any changes. All this 
information is available to them through
See BUDGET, page A8

Do you know what elucubrate 
means? Succedaneum? How about 
frappuccino? Macchiato? Ah, there 
we go.
Have you met Starbucks newest 
media venture? Americas favorite 
caffeinated corporation has taken to 
promoting films. Thats right  amid 
the artsy-fartsy wall murals, pleasantly 
dim hanging lights, and oh-so-comfy 
velvet chairs, your beloved Starbucks 
atmosphere is now featuring yet an
other Piece of Flair: An ad campaign for 
one of the newest movies by Lions Gate 
Films, Akeelah and the Bee.
Akeelah is the feel-good movie of the 
moment, about an African-American 
girl facing adversity in several grueling 
forms, namely poverty, race, and multi
syllabic words. Yeah, another spellingbee film, as if the world even needed 
one. Surprise, surprise: Our Akeelah 
seeks the guidance of a wise old dude 
whos otherwise unaffiliated with her 
family and proceeds to triumph by the 
movies end, either by way of trophy 
or heightened self-esteem. If you cant 
make it to the theater, just rent The 
Karate Kid or something  its sure to 
have the same effect.
The Karate Kid, however, has not 
taken over Starbucks. Is your venti Caffe 
Americano too hot? I invite you to pro
tect yourself with a themed cardboard 
insulator, adorned with a hard-to-spell 
word like pterodactyl or cambist. 
Has the impossible happened? Is your 
wi-fi Internet connection neglecting to 
entertain? Maybe youd prefer one of 
the travel-sized Scrabble boards that 
are currently on sale at the register.
You were never good with words. 
In second grade, you got the spelling 
book with the turtle on it, not the train. 
Nows your chance to make up for lost 
.time. Man, too bad the SAT was in high 
school.
Wait  maybe you didnt come into 
Starbucks in search of tacky advertise
ments. Maybe youre content with your 
grasp of the English language, however 
tenuous. Maybe youre not particu
larly in want of movie-going guidance. 
Maybe you were just... thirsty?
I can only speak for myself, but at my 
recent visit to the Craig Street Starbucks 
in search of a caramel frap, I found 
the whole thing pretty damn unusual. 
Ive long suspected Starbucks of putting 
nicotine (or something similar) in their 
coffee, but this is serious. As far as Im 
concerned, this might be the last straw, 
the last plasticky-green straw. I might 
have had it. Starbucks, we need to talk.
Which is more disturbing: That this 
isnt some caffeine-induced coma or
that Starbucks really has reduced itself 
to pimping movies? That Im strangely 
tempted to suck it up and trek the extra 
couple of yards to Kiva Han? Or  oh no
 does it get even worse? What could 
possibly be worse than how weird it is 
that Starbucks is allowing its walls to be 
sullied with an ad campaign? Only one 
thing: That its not very weird at all.
Screw biscotti  I should be eating my 
words. Initially, I was so shocked about 
this Akeelah business that I nearly for
got that Ive been coming to Starbucks 
for entertainment advice for years. 
And by I, I mean America. But back to 
me: Whenever I see an XM radio, the 
Starbucks station is my first inclination.
I can never seem to make it past one 
of their CD racks without at least fin
gering the selection, perhaps making a 
purchase. And as for literature  I cant 
recall the last time I entered a Barnes 
and Noble that didnt have a Starbucks 
nestled somewhere within. What is film 
but the next stop in Starbucks conquest 
of all that is media?
Whatever Starbucks is trying to pull 
in the world of entertainment seems to 
be in fundamental opposition to what 
it means to be a coffeehouse. If all I 
had was a craving for java, Id go to 
McDonalds. But a coffeehouse is more 
than that, and it has nothing to do with 
movies chronicling inner-city spellingbee participants.
In Europe and colonial America, cof
feehouses were significant meeting 
places for revolutionaries. People came 
to share their ideas, not get them with 
their beverages. The Sons of Liberty met 
to discuss the Boston Tea Party at the 
historic Green Dragon Tavern. In Paris, 
plans made at the Caf de Foy culmi
nated in the storming of the Bastille. 
What plans are we making now? Meet 
me outside Loews at 7?
As Starbucks continues to epitomize 
the American coffee house, is it any 
wonder that we Americans are often 
scolded for our 21st-century apathy? All
I know is that if I want to have a heated 
discussion about the war in Iraq, abor
tion, same-sex marriages, or a host of 
other provocative topics, I dont go look
ing for it at Starbucks.
Maybe thats just what coffeehouses 
have become. But just because I wont 
be doing any revolutionary scheming 
over a white hot chocolate anytime 
soon doesnt mean that Im content with 
allowing Starbucks to continue such 
over-the-top marketing. Maybe spelling 
is important  theres but a small differ
ence between customer and consumer. 
Which one do you want to be?
Starbucks, Ive got one word for you: 
U-N-A-C-C-E-P-T-A-B-L-E.
This is Sarah Mogins (smogin@J op-ed 
debut. If youd like to talk about it over 
coffee, shed be much obliged.

U.S. policies of entitlement allow immigrant freeloading
Benjamin Hackett
The story of this nation has been col
lectively written by the immigrant pen. 
Titled The American Dream, this wildly 
successful and popular tale is about to gain 
a new author. Yet instead of simply writing 
the next verse, this wave of immigrant au
thors seems intent on starting a new book. 
There is no longer satisfaction with build
ing for the future; an entitlement culture 
has grown. This contemporary tale is to 
be authored by illegal immigrants, but the 
pen, paper, and publishing are paid for by 
the American taxpayer.
Not offended yet? Soon. When reading 
this piece, remember that the term Latin 
is not code for Anglos hate Mexicans. 
That said, having to drop my upside-down 
Mexican flag in order to write this piece 
was, in fact, quite the bother.
The original history of this country is 
British and Protestant (i.e., white). These 
great minds put forth the doctrines and 
institutions that form todays ultimate he
gemony, the United States of America.
Later, when other European immigrants 
arrived and were processed, there was a 
sense of connection with their purpose. 
That purpose: Make their lives better and 
prepare for their childrens futures. There 
was no Social Security. There was no wel
fare. There was no Medicare or Medicaid. 
There was only the individual and the 
fruits of his or her labor. Personally pro
viding for ones family was essential to 
daily life. If you failed to provide, and your 
neighbors proved less than charitable, you 
paid the consequences.
At this point in history, the American 
entitlement teat was still fully ensconced 
within the brassiere of hard work.
At times many generations worked, 
piggybacking on previous generations ef
forts in order to produce offspring with a 
secure future. With an upbringing devoid 
of safety nets, is it any wonder that the val
ues instilled among these first American 
immigrants produced many of todays 
Fortune 500 CEOs?
Todays illegal immigrant culture is far
less ecstatic about hard work: It is put 
together around a sense of entitlement. 
They ask for  and often receive  free 
medical care, free food, and even work 
from those employers immoral enough 
to be content with aiding the erosion of 
American sovereignty.
Everyone saw the recent pictures of the 
protesters. These hardworking illegals 
and their gleeful idiot sympathizers took to 
the streets demanding their catchphrases 
be listened to and trying to extend their 
half-day of class vacation into a full one.
Illegal immigrants are not undocumented 
immigrants. Undocumented immigrants 
are those waiting in line at the USCIS (U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services, 
formerly Immigration and Naturalization 
Services) building who are yet to receive 
their green cards.
Some argue that there is a fundamental 
difference, one that goes beyond skin tone, 
in the Latin American immigrant versus 
the European immigrant. Harvard profes
sor Samuel P. Huntington argues, The 
persistent inflow of Hispanic immigrants 
threatens to divide the United States into 
two peoples, two cultures, and two lan
guages. Unlike past immigrant groups, 
Mexicans and other Latinos have not as
similated into mainstream U.S. culture, 
forming instead their own political and 
linguistic enclaves ... rejecting the AngloProtestant values that built the American 
dream. The United States ignores this chal
lenge at its peril.
Huntingtons contiguity argument out
lining an essential difference beween Latin 
and European immigrants proves com
pelling. This situation is unique for the 
United States and the world. No other First 
World country has such an extensive land 
frontier with a Third World country....
Stanford University historian David 
Kennedy has pointed out that the income 
gap between the United States and Mexico 
is the largest between any two contiguous 
countries in the world. Huntington adds 
that this contiguity enables Mexican im
migrants to remain in intimate contact 
with their families, friends, and home lo
calities in Mexico as no other immigrants 
have been able to do.
Without the long journey over a sea,
these immigrants have their native country 
a stones throw away. It is no wonder that 
assimilating these immigrants has proven 
increasingly difficult. After all, what is the 
incentive to assimilate when services are 
provided regardless of process or effort?
Conservatives, big libs, and the like are 
all pro-legal immigration. However, many 
believe in process and effort. Accomplishing 
something (legal) garners a proper sense 
of entitlement. Scuttling across the border 
packed into a white Ford Econoline van is 
not effort; it is illegal.
Poll after poll shows the American pub
lics overwhelming support for enforcing 
current laws and for deportation. This is a 
democracy. Yet, when it comes to getting

We cannot wait any longer to address 
pedestrian safety issues
Benjamin Saalbach-Walsh
In earlier societies, humans 
raised animals with enough 
room to move and live a rela
tively natural life. Today, this is 
not the case. Factory farms, in 
the pursuit of efficiency, profit, 
and economically competitive 
products, raise animals in horri
ble conditions. Carnegie Mellon 
University, like most American 
businesses, uses factory-farmed 
meat, eggs, and dairy products. 
This money could be used to 
support alternatives to factory 
farming, such as Certified Hu
mane farms, which may be able 
to provide animals with a much 
higher quality of life.
Factory-farmed animals are 
often kept in cramped and filthy 
conditions for their entire lives. 
They get very little medical care 
and undergo mutilation without 
anesthesia. Slaughterhouses of
ten do not properly render the 
animals unconscious before cut
ting their throats, boiling them, 
or cutting them apart.
For example, chickens are 
raised in stacked battery cages 
with four to seven chickens 
packed in a cage scarcely big 
enough for one chicken to flap 
its wings. In order to keep chick
ens from pecking each other to
death, their beaks are seared 
off without anesthesia. Feces 
from higher cages are allowed 
to fall to lower cages. Disease is 
rampant. They are given growth 
hormones, antibiotics, and other 
additives without regard to 
their (or our) health.
On the other hand, in Certi
fied Humane facilities, cage-free 
chickens are raised in ware
houses, notin cages, and they are 
given room to nest,-dust-bathe, 
scratch, and perch. Certified Hu
mane seems to be a promising 
way to start improving animal 
conditions, although at the same 
time it is not an endpoint.
Is there any reason why bil
lions of animals should be forced 
to endure lives of confinement, 
denial of natural instincts, and 
suffering? Animals may think 
differently than humans, but 
they are both conscious and 
aware. They dislike pain and 
confinement. Is a humans right 
to not be abused based on his 
or her intelligence or ability to 
think? Brain-damaged or coma
tose humans still deserve to be 
treated decently, and abusing 
them is still immoral and illegal. 
The abuses of factory farming 
are justified by saying that were 
saving money, but in raising 
animals, part of the cost entailed 
is in treating them decently. Fac
tory farming tries to cut corners 
that should not be cut.
The European Union has re
solved to phase out battery cages 
for chickens by 2012. Until the 
U.S. follows its lead, we can sup
port more ethical farming prac
tices with our money and clearly 
tell the American animal agri
culture industry what we want. 
The Humane Society reports that 
over 80 universities1 have imple
mented a more humane policy 
for their eggs. With support 
from the student body, Carnegie 
Mellon could join them. Addi
tionally, a cheap and immediate 
way of decreasing animal abuse 
is to reduce the amount of meat 
and eggs our school serves  
even a percent or two less meat 
on the menu could make a big 
difference over time.
Dining Services is discussing 
Certified Humane eggs. How
ever, change doesnt happen if 
no one is willing to help make it 
happen, if everyone lets someone 
else sort it out. Students have to 
step up and work for change, for 
that is the first step, and change 
must be ongoing. Carnegie Mel
lon considers itself a leading 
university. However, this is only 
the truth insofar as each of our 
actions leads us forward, and it is 
only meaningful if we are mov
ing toward worthy goals.
I feel terrible about losing a 
student to Tuesday nights ac
cident at Forbes and Margaret 
Morrison. I cant begin to discuss 
the value of a life and the terri
ble loss that we as a campus feel 
when one of our students dies.
However, I can comment on 
the state of pedestrian safety on 
campus. The article available on 
The Tartans website suggests no 
driver error in Tuesdays acci
dent, but I wonder if it is finally 
time for the University to ad
dress this issue. I dont believe 
that what happened was com
pletely unavoidable. I hope that 
The Tartan will take the time 
to address this concern and do 
some investigative reporting 
on the issues of pedestrians on 
campus and in Pittsburgh.
Im sure I am not the only one 
who has almost been hit cross
ing at Tech Street and Margaret 
Morrison because drivers con
sider that stop sign optional. 
Im sure there are many oth
ers who feel bullied or scared 
walking across Fifth Avenue at 
Morewood by drivers who turn 
without looking. There are many 
poorly lit, poorly marked inter
sections and few penalties for 
drivers who speed through cam
pus. Double parking and people 
searching for coveted metered 
spaces cause a nightmare for 
pedestrians and drivers alike 
on Tech Street by Flagstaff Hill. 
Pittsburgh itself does not have 
a good record on pedestrian 
safety, and so often I hear inter
views of police only highlighting 
the faults of the pedestrian.
Carnegie Mellon is a relatively 
small, enclosed campus, and 
most of the students, staff, and 
faculty make their way around 
the campus on foot. Yet I often 
feel that I am a constant an
noyance to drivers who speed 
through and around campus. 
This letter is not blind outrage 
to an isolated, horrible event. 
Rather, this is an ongoing issue, 
and I hope that we can finally 
make some necessary changes 
that will improve safety for ev
eryone on campus. Carnegie 
Mellon should petition the city 
administration for improve
ments as well as make strides to 
improve the conditions itself.

Carnival officially begins on 
Thursday afternoon, and with 
that comes the excitement 
around Sweepstakes, Booth, fun
nel cakes, fireworks, comedians, 
and concerts; however, this year 
there is a new addition to the 
excitement: student government 
elections. Elections will be held 
online on April 24 and 25. (The 
Web address will be published 
at a later date.) All students will 
have a chance to vote for student 
body president and student body 
vice-president for finance. Un
dergraduate students will also 
vote for their Student Senators 
and on a referendum that will 
reassess the media fee used to 
pay for the Collegiate Reader
ship Program sponsored by USA 
Today.
Tomorrow at 5:30 pm, WRCT, 
The Tartan, and cmuTV will 
be sponsoring a debate for the 
candidates for student body pres
ident and vice-president. In the 
next week or so, take some time 
out to learn about the candidates 
by talking to them and reading 
their platforms, which will be 
available on the website where 
the elections will be held. This 
way, you will be able to make an 
educated decision. I encourage 
all students to remember to vote 
in the student government elec
tions. These newly elected of
ficials will be your official voice 
to the school and administration 
and can potentially change cam
pus for the better.
Last Thursday, the Undergrad
uate Student Senate voted to 
approve a referendum to ques
tion whether the undergraduate 
students still want the media 
fee. The media fee funds the 
Collegiate Readership Program, 
which brings USA Today, the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and The 
New York Times to campus for 
undergraduate students. These 
newspapers can be picked up in 
one of 11 locations on campus, 
including academic buildings 
and residence halls. The media 
fee is $5 per semester.
At this point the program is 
running with a surplus due to a 
lower readership than what was 
expected during the trial in Oc
tober and November 2004, but I 
believe readership will increase 
with more important news 
events like midterm elections for 
the national government.
If you havent taken advan
tage of having the newspapers 
on campus, please take some 
time this week to look at what 
the program offers students. 1 
look forward to seeing the re
sults of the election in a little 
over a week and wish the best oi 
luck to the winners.
Tom Sabram (sbp@.) remembers 
the challenges of campaigning for 
a student government executive 
office and would love for all stu
dents to learn about the candi
dates and vote in the election.

the Office of Student Activities.
But in reality, even that is in
sufficient. The onus should be on 
the requesting groups to prove 
that they use the students money 
well. All groups should be re
quired to submit the equivalent 
of Form 990, which not-for-profit 
organizations must submit to 
the IRS each year to maintain 
their tax-exempt status. (For in
stance, you can see University 
President Jared Cohons exact 
six-figure salary in Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys Form 990 at 
www.guidestar.org.) A similar 
form for student organizations 
would require the groups to re
port important information about 
their financial activity of the pre
vious year; for example:
 a statement of income de
tailed by JFCs subsidy, grants, 
membership dues, donations 
(potentially including donated 
labor), and program fees;
 a statement of expenses cat
egorized as relating to program 
services, management or over
head, fundraising, or payments 
to affiliates. Each of these cat
egories should be further divided 
into categories such as salaries, 
office supplies, travel, etc.; .
 a statement of program ser
vice accomplishments noting the 
most important activities under
taken by the organization, includ
ing a description of each program 
or service and an estimate of the 
scope of the program or services 
effect (e.g., the number of people 
who attended a lecture);
 a statement of the value 
and status of capital equipment, 
which would be especially useful 
for larger groups.
Making student organizations 
accountable in this way would 
give the JFC a means by which 
to evaluate the performance of 
each organization. It would help 
them perform a budget variance 
analysis, an assessment of the 
difference between what a group 
requested and what the group 
actually spent. Variance analyses 
could guide the JFC in accurately 
allocating the right amounts to 
the right organizations.
By assessing the finances of the
JFCs budget practices show lack of consideration
and tell the student body 
what they need to know.

various student organizations, 
the JFC will also be able to iden
tify which organizations make 
the best use of student money. 
By using financial metrics such 
as fundraising efficiency and pro
gram service-to-overhead ratios, 
the JFC could know precisely 
which groups get the most out of 
the dollars they spend  some
thing they should take into con
sideration as they allocate.
Even more importantly, re
quiring student organizations 
to report their financial activity 
would force them to be more 
aware of their finances, and it 
would give them a way to mea
sure their success and set mean
ingful goals for improving the 
way they use money in the fu
ture. For example, the Rowing 
Club, which is able to generate 
an astonishing $90,000 or more 
per year, could quantify the costeffectiveness of their fundraising 
initiatives to help get even better 
year-to-year.
Timing is a challenge on this 
front. Budgets for the next fis
cal year are evaluated before the 
end of the current fiscal year. 
However, most groups will have 
completed the majority of their 
funded activities in time for the 
appeals process. Furthermore, 
the JFC should be looking at the 
data from as many previous years 
as is relevant and helpful.
Problem: The end is not near
The Tartan has been a part of 
this University for 100 years, and 
we plan to be here for another 
hundred. In fact, most organiza
tions on campus will be around 
for many years to come. But the 
funding process stymies efforts 
to plan more than one year in 
advance.
There are a number of orga
nizations that rely on expensive 
equipment  from radio broad
cast antennas to oscilloscopes to 
high-end Web servers  to per
form their functions. While the 
largest purchases can be financed 
with the help of the dean of 
Student Affairs, other large pur
chases should be anticipated and 
planned. By planning ahead, the 
financial impact of major pur
CiW is an equal opportunity/affirmative* action institution.31051
chases can be distributed evenly 
over the years, so the budgets 
of other groups, especially the 
smaller ones, are not affected by 
a sudden influx of requests for 
big puchases.
Planning to replace such aging 
equipment is especially impor
tant. When expensive equipment 
fails during the year without 
money allocated to replace it, the 
special allocations budget takes 
a hit.
Recommendation: Encourage 
large groups to plan for the 
future
All organizations that rely on 
capital equipment such as com
puter systems, lab equipment, 
machine tools, and should plan to 
replace and upgrade that equip
ment years in advance. Further
more, organizations that develop 
plans for replacing systems that 
become outdated at a predictable 
rate  such as computer systems
 should create memoranda of 
understanding with the Joint 
Funding Committee in order to 
improve consistency year to year. 
This will make the funding pro
cess more predictable and mini
mize sharp increases in organiza
tions demands.
Problem: Equal representation
Each student organization is 
given a JFC representative who 
learns about the organizations 
needs in order to advocate on 
their behalf. Each member of the 
committee is assigned to a certain 
number of groups. This is a great 
way to ensure that members of 
the Joint Funding Committee are 
informed about the unique needs 
of each group.
Some groups representatives, 
however, cant speak on their 
groups behalf. Thats because 
the chair of the committee  
who remains a neutral modera
tor of the proceedings  is the 
representative of some groups. 
Furthermore, the JFC chairs tend 
to be so overextended that they 
do not have the time it takes 
to adequately familiarize them
selves with the organizations 
they represent.
Recommendation: The chair 
should not represent groups
Plain and simple: The chair of 
the JFC should not represent any 1 
student organization. Each or
ganization deserves to have an 
advocate, and a neutral chair is ' 
unable to fill that role. 
Problem: Professional conduct 
is lacking
The importance and serious
ness of the budgeting process \ 
should be reflected in the behavior 
of the JFCs members. If student * 
organization members are to take 
the process seriously, they must 
be respected. One would expect 
that a group of adults charged 
with the management responsi
bilities of a million dollars would ^ 
be able to conduct themselves in ^ 
a professional manner. But not all ' 
of them do.
The Tartan has it from sourcesHand has witnessed a certainImember of this years JFC treat
ing organizations representa
tives with disrespect and conde
scension. Members of JFC have 
also made disrespectful jokes this 
year and last.
Recommendation: Set clear 
expectations
Whether it involves adopting 
a code of conduct or simply dis
cussing the behavior expected 
of committee members during 
training, the leadership of each 
years committee must take re
sponsibility for the conduct of the 
committee by making the expec
tations clear to all members. The 
chair of the committee should 
not tolerate inappropriate jokes 
and disrespectful conduct.
Conclusion
The JFCs work seems endless, 
so we understand that finding 
time to improve their methods 
is difficult. We hope these rec
ommendations help student 
government improve itself 
more easily, so they are better 
able to serve the students they 
represent. *

Rowing Club
Carnegie Mellons rowing club put 
together solid performances amid a field 
of college peers at the two-day Knecht 
Cup on April 8-9 in Camden, N.J.
The womens varsity four (Division 
III) boat of seniors Darbi Roberts, 
Georgia Bullen, and Sarah Wilson Junior 
Maura Ferguson, and coxswain Emma 
Friedman, captured gold in both their 
heat on Saturday (8:30.0) and the fi
nal on Sunday (8:29.5). In the finals, 
Carnegie Mellon finished first with well 
over a boat length of open water, 13.2 
seconds ahead of second-place New York 
University.
The womens lightweight four boat 
of senior Sarah Crosskey, sophomore 
Crystal Lee, and juniors Stefanie Sydlik, 
Cara Heller, and Friedman, was Carnegie 
Mellons only other boat to compete in 
the finals after finishing second in their 
heat on Saturday with a time of 7:36.8. 
Rowing against a brutal crosswind in 
the final on Sunday, the women finished 
fifth with a time of 9:02.2.

Kristin Koslowski, Natalie Weir, and cox
swain Elliot Beltzer came off a first place 
finish in their heat poised for success in 
the finals, but were disappointed when 
their race was cancelled due to increas
ingly horrible weather conditions.
Senior David Rice and junior Adam 
Suhy finished second in their heat of 
the mens pair with a time of 7:39.2, but 
failed to qualify for Sundays final.
The rowing club will be back in action 
Saturday, April 29, at the Governors 
Cup Regatta in Charleston, W.Va., and 
Sunday, April 30, at the Car-Du-Pitt in 
Pittsburgh.
Baseball
The Carnegie Mellon baseball team 
fell to Robert Morris University last 
Saturday 15-6, after Robert Morris hit 
two grand slams in the bottom of the 
sixth inning to take the lead. First-year 
Brian Tabata led the Tartans offense 
with a home run, a single, and three RBIs. 
Carnegie Mellon baseball plays Robert 
Morris University again on Thursday.
Mens Lacrosse
The mens lacrosse team suffered a
tough defeat against the University of 
Rochester (10-15) in their last regular 
season game, played in Rochester on 
Saturday, April 8.
Carnegie Mellon controlled the first 
three quarters of the game, going into 
the fourth quarter leading 9-7, only to 
give up eight goals and the win during 
the last 11 minutes of play. Rochesters 
defense held the team to five goals in the 
second half.
The Tartans offense was led by senior 
Alex Knecht, who had three goals and an 
assist during the game. Sophomore Zach 
Teeple and junior Chris Broglie each had 
three points; Teeple had two goals and 
one assist and Broglie had a goal and 
two assists.
Sophomore Steven Blair added two 
goals while senior Troy Cox and junior 
Rick McMullen each contributed a goal 
to the Tartans total. Senior goaltender 
Pete LaFave had 13 saves, out of 28 shots 
on net for the game.
Carnegie Mellons lacrosse team fin
ished their regular season 5-3 overall 
and 4-1 in league play.
This ranks the Carnegie Mellon men 
22nd in the country with a bid to the 
Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association 
playoffs, an impressive feat for the teams 
first year in the United States Lacrosse
First-year Brian Tabata is batting .318 for the Tartans with seven hits in 22 at-bats.

Everyones hard work through
out the season is starting to pay 
off, said senior Jocelyn Sikora 
as the Tartan women were able 
to collect a total of three firstplace finishes. Sikora won the 
800-meter race with a time of 
2:20.65. First-year Jessica Meng 
won the triple jump with jump 
of 10.86 meters. Meng went on 
to add a second-place finish in 
the high jump with an impressive

The final first-place finish was 
claimed by Carnegie Mellons 
4x400-meter relay A team, 
consisting of first-year Jackie 
Andreozzi, sophomore Ashley 
Bakelmun, junior Amber Fuller, 
and Sikora. They finished the re
lay with a time of 4:12.58.
The women had a sizeable num
ber of second-place performances, 
including personal best times 
for Andreozzi in the 400-meters 
(1:02.25) and first-year Carolyn 
Clayton in the 1500-meter run 
(5:16.82). The other secondplace winners were junior Lizza 
McGregor in the discus (34.12
meters) and junior Becky Metier, 
who came in second in both the 
shot put and the hammer throw, 
with 11.48 meters and 40.85 me
ters, respectively.

At Bucknell, against tough com
petition, the Tartan men had solid 
runs in the 1500-meter event, 
where four Tartans finished in 
the top 35. The top performer 
was first-year Brian Harvey, who 
finished 26th, just under four 
minutes with a time of 3:59.69.
Senior Nick End was the only 
Tartan to take on the grueling 
5000-meter run, finishing the 
race also at 26th with a time 
of 14:52.78. First-year Ryan 
Anderson finished 12th in the 
3000-meter steeplechase event 
(9:43.10).
The team saw Sikora finish 
23rd overall in the 1500-meter 
run with a time of 4:48.18. The 
only other Tartan woman who 
placed was senior KJ Helmstetter 
in the 3000-meter steeplechase 
with a time of 11:51.30.
During Carnival, the track 
and field teams will be in 
Cleveland competing in the 
UAA Championship. With our 
improved health and hard work 
these past few weeks, we hope 
to improve from our indoor per
formance, Sikora said when 
asked for predictions about the 
championship meet. There is 
a potential for many more indi
vidual and relay champions as 
well as medal performances.

Carnegie Mellon tennis enjoys home-court advantage
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
On Tuesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens tennis team 
hosted Mercyhurst College (Pa.), 
handily defeating the Lakers 9-0.
In singles, senior Alison Liu, ju
nior Mona Iyer, sophomores Amy 
Staloch and Samantha Schultz, 
and first-years Sheena David and 
Kelly Nakamura all defeated their 
Mercyhurst opponents.
Staloch and David then 
teamed up to defeat Mercyhursts 
Christine Mersch and Jamie 
Sutyak 8-2. Schultz and David 
went on to defeat Mercyhursts 
Jennifer Daly and Jaclyn McLean 
8-5. Liu and Nakamura finished 
the day with a pairs win against 
Mercyhursts Maria Franco and 
Kassie Leuschel 8-0.
The sweep by the Carnegie 
Mellon women dropped the 
Lakers to 11-10 and moved the 
Tartans to 11-5. Coming off a 
successful fall season, the teams 
spring success is no surprise. We 
expected them [the women] to 
be pretty tough, said assistant 
coach Kevin Girard.
Carnegie Mellons tennis was 
not done for the week, as the 
womens team hosted Washington 
College on Saturday and went on 
to beat the Shorewomen 8-1.
The Tartans swept the doubles 
matches with Liu and Nakamura 
teaming up to drop Washingtons 
Lyndsey Beidle and Kristen 
Hossick 8-1 to start the day. 
Schultz and David next defeated 
Washingtons Lydia Bull and 
Blake Leeser 8-3, and finally Iyer 
and Staloch captured an 8-5 win 
over Washingtons Allison Daciek 
and Beth Foster.
In the number-one singles, 
Staloch struggled against Daciek, 
coming back from an early first 
set deficit 5-4 to take the first 
set 7-5. Early in the second set, 
Staloch took a 4-1 lead, but then 
lost five straight games, falling 
6-4 and sending the match to a 
super tiebreaker. Staloch even
tually won the super tiebreaker
10-5.
Staloch was not the only Tartan 
who needed a super tiebreaker to 
defeat her opponent. Nakamura 
went deep into the afternoon be
fore finishing off Leeser 6-4, 6-7 
(5-7), 1-0 (10-5) in the numberfive singles.
Iyer controlled her numbertwo singles match against Beth 
Foster, winning in a straight set 
6-1, 6-0.
David overcame a tough sec
ond set to defeat Hossick at 
number-three singles 6-0, 7-5. 
Schultz defeated Ryoko Sawada 
at the number-six spot 6-1, 6-2, 
securing the team victory for the 
Tartans.
The mens tennis team also 
hosted Washington College on 
Saturday, but was not as success
ful as the womens team, falling 
3-4.
Sophomore Andrew Clearfield 
won the number-two singles 
match against opponent Tim 
Riskie 6-0, 6-1, with his only loss 
coming at the beginning of the 
second set.
Junior Jordan Koslosky eventu
ally won his number-five singles 
match 1-6, 6-1, 6-1, despite fall
ing behind 5-0 in the first set. 
Senior Carl Yang won the last 
match of the day at number foui 
singles with a tough 6-3, 6-2 
victory.
Yesterday, womens and mens 
tennis were again at home, host
ing Johns Hopkins. In results 
that were strangely similar to 
Saturdays results, the Tartan 
women again took home a vic
tory 8-1, and the men again fell 
just short 3-4.
The women again swept the 
doubles competition, with 
Staloch and Iyer teaming up 
to defeat Johns Hopkins play
ers Brittany Matava and Tayna 
Gulnik 8-4. Nakamura and Liu 
came together to beat Johns 
Hopkins players Becky Busch and 
Stephanie Carr 8-2, and Weiss 
and Schultz rounded out the dou
bles victories with their 8-5 win 
over Priva Puri and Jill Seidman.
Staloch, Iyer, Liu, Nakamura,
and Schultz all won their sin
gles matches. When asked about 
breakout performances by new
comers to the team, Girard noted 
that first-year Nakamura was 
a real asset to the team: Kelly 
played pretty well today, and 
she also won the number-four 
singles.
Coming up short, Carnegie 
Mellon was unable to muster 
up a team win against Johns
Hopkins. Singles competitors 
Yang, Koslsky, and sophomore 
Stephen Kuhn all won their 
matches.
In the mens only doubles 
victory of the weekend, Munoz 
and Clearfield teamed up to de
feat Johns Hopkins players Kevin 
Ma and Matthew Naftilan 9-7. 
After this weekends defeats, the 
Carnegie Mellon men drop to 3-
11 in dual meets for the year.
The men went into the spring 
ranked 22nd in the nation. 
Considering their ranking, the 
men have been somewhat dis
appointed with their recent 
performances, We have had 
some injuries, said Girard, and 
some matches that we lost we 
should have won.
Despite some disappointing 
performances on the mens side, 
both teams still have a positive
outlook when speaking about 
the upcoming University Athletic 
Associate Championship, which 
is being held at Emory University 
over Carnival weekend: We 
finished strong going into the 
conference tournament, Girard 
concluded.

Track prepares for UAA championshipDay two saves golf 
team from disaster

The Carnegie Mellon golf 
teams string of four top-three 
finishes ended when they took 
fifth place at the Mid-Atlantic 
Regional this past weekend. 
Although the team played below 
its high expectations, the Tartans 
did not leave Hershey, Pa., emptyhanded.
I think our fifth-place finish 
was great after we struggled so 
badly the first day, said senior 
A. J. Straub, referring to the teams 
Sunday score of 331, which was 
good enough for eighth place af
ter the first day. It gives us a lot 
of confidence to know that even 
if we have a bad round one day 
we can turn it around the next 
day and catch back up.
The teams struggles on Sunday 
were due in part to the courses 
setup. Challenging pin positions 
and fast greens made putting very 
difficult. It was tough conditions, 
and for whatever reasons all of 
our guys played about the worst 
round they could probably play, 
coach Rich Erdelyi said.
Senior Matt Simone, who had 
averaged 73 in his prior three 
rounds, shot 89, 18 shots over 
par. I didnt putt well; I didnt 
hit the ball well; I didnt really do 
anything well, he said. When 
you combine not hitting greens 
in regulation with the not putting 
well, that adds up to a pretty big 
score.
Senior Blakfe Darbys day-one 
performance also reflected the 
teams putting inefficiencies. 
The greens were just really 
tricky. They were playing faster 
than anything we played be
fore, said Darby, who putted 41 
times on Sunday. I was strik
ing the ball really well, hitting 
greens in regulation, and just 
three-putting them. It was just 
really frustrating. 
j) First-year Alex Timmons, who
shot 82, also felt the effects of 
the difficult course. We really 
couldnt get much confidence, 
because if you hit a putt too hard 
theres a good chance you would 
have a longer putt on the way 
back.
While the teams putting woes 
hamstrung them all day, the rest 
of the field also posted undesir
able scores.
If you look at the scores, they 
were horrifically high when 
you consider that these are the 
15 best teams in five states. 
Allegheny [shot] 318 on the first 
da3'. Erdelyi said, speaking of 
the 34-over par score posted by 
the number-one ranked team in 
Carnegie Mellons region. I cant 
remember in the last 10 years an 
Allegheny team that [shot] 318.
Despite the eiglith-place stand
ing after Sunday, the Tartans 
approached Mondays final round 
with optimism. We talked, and 
we just said that we dont have to 
shoot 295, but we gotta probably 
shoot under 310 just to try to get 
back in it. And maybe some of 
the other teams will back up and, 
sure enough, they did, Erdelyi 
said.
By carding a 307 
the second-highest round of 
the tournament  the Tartans 
climbed the Monday leader board 
and finished fifth, just one stroke 
behind three teams tied with a 
637 two-day score.
Simones 73, which included 
three birdies, led the teams scor
ing.
I thought it was outstanding. 
It was a great round of golf, 
Erdelyi said of Simones round. It 
was really a gutty performance. 
He improved by 16 strokes, and 
not that you think a kids go
ing to shoot one or two over par 
every time, but thats what hes 
been doing the last three or four 
matches.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens track and field team 
had three very successful meets 
during the past week, starting 
off strong with a win at home 
and then going to the Bucknell 
Outdoor Classic and Slippery 
Rock Invitational. While the lat
ter two events were not scored, 
the Tartans used these opportu
nities to fine tune their abilities, 
pushing themselves to maximize 
their potential as the University 
Athletic Association Division III
Championship draws near.
On Tuesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational provided 
beautiful weather for the Tartans, 
Waynesburg (Pa.) College, and 
the University of Pittsburgh at 
Johnstown (UPJ), setting the 
stage for impressive perfor
mances by the athletes.
The Tartan men, led by junior 
Geoff Misek, dominated the 
1500-meter event, sweeping the 
first 11 spots. Misek became the 
first Tartan to break four minutes 
in the 1500-meters this season 
with a personal record time of 
3:59:25. Sophomore Drew Miller 
and first-year Mike Haley placed
second and third, setting per
sonal record times of 4:01.51 and 
4:03.33, respectively.
The home meet turned out 
to be an event full of personal 
records, as junior Davey Quinn 
won the 800-meter run with a 
personal best of 1:54.41, setting 
the third-fastest time in Tartan 
track history. Coming in second 
was junior Keith Torluemke, who 
finished the race in 1:55.83, 
improving on his previous 
best performance. The Tartans 
continued to secure four more 
first-place finishes with junior 
Nick Bannister winning both the 
100-meter high hurdles and the
400-meter hurdles. First-year 
Colin Marks collected his own 
win with a 13.42-meter leap in 
the triple jump, and senior Tom 
Matta won the hammer with a 
throw of 49 meters.
Overall, the Tartan men closed 
out the win over Waynesburg 
with a team score of 87 points, to 
Waynesburgs 75 points.
While the men handily se
cured their win at home, the 
women did not disappoint, scor
ing 123 points overall, defeating 
Waynesburg (89 points) and UPJ 
(70 points).

Senior runner Jocelyn Sikora 
finished first in the 800-meter 
race on Saturday, April 8, at 
the Washington and Jefferson 
Invitational and again on 
Tuesday, April 11, at the 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational. 
That Saturday, Sikora crossed 
the line with a time of 2:23:82. 
Three days later and over two
seconds faster, Sikora won the 
800-meter race at home with a 
time of 2:20:65. Recently, The 
Tartan had a chance to talk to 
her about track and running for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Tartan: When did you start 
running track and why?
Sikora: I started in seventh 
grade. I used to play soccer, 
and in the off-season I thought
1 would see if I liked running. 
Thats how I started sprinting. 
When I moved to Orlando for 
my senior year of high school, I 
joined the cross-country team to 
make some friends and havent 
really rlin many sprints since.
T: Did you always want to 
run in college?
S: Until my senior year of 
high school I didnt really think 
that I was good enough to run 
in college. I knew that I would 
keep running wherever I went, 
but maybe not competitively.
T: What is the hardest part 
about being a Carnegie Mellon 
student athlete?
S: The hardest part is the 
things that you miss, both during 
practice, and on the weekends. 
Ive missed a lot of campus
r
events because of track.
T: What is the best part?
S: The teammates. Some of 
the people that I run track with 
have turned out to be my best 
friends. Also, there are tons of 
places that I get to see because 
of track; I get to travel all over 
the country to compete.
T: Do you have any pre-race 
rituals or good luck charms?
S: Well, I have lucky socks; 
thats pretty much the main 
thing. Im also pretty quiet and 
keep to myself before a race. I 
like to sit and be quiet and listen 
to the Ataris.
T: Where is your favorite 
place to compete?
S: Definitely at home. My 
roommate and my friends who 
arent on the team are there 
cheering me on, and that is by 
far the best part about running 
at home.
T: What is your most mean
ingful accomplishment to date?
S: Well, there are several that
I probably couldnt differentiate. 
During my sophomore year I 
won the 800-meter [race] here 
and that was terrific. I was also
named UAA athlete of the year 
for indoor track, which was 
a great honor, and last year,
I qualified for nationals in 
outdoor [track]. Take your pick, 
but I cant choose.
T: What is the best advice you 
have been given?
S: Dont lose the race
mentally. Someone once told 
me that it the mental part was 
the most important and to make 
sure that I didnt lose it in my 
head.
T: Do you have track
aspirations for your future?
S: It would be great to be able 
to keep running competitively, 
but its so hard because you have 
to enter everything yourself. I 
definitely plan to keep running 
in road races and those types 
of things. I also have a goal to 
be able to run a marathon and 
then run a marathon in every 
city that Ive lived in.
T: What do you plan to 
do once you leave Carnegie 
Mellon?
S: Im going to be working 
with Bank of America down 
in Charlotte doing some risk 
analysis.

Big Als Metal Shop
Dreams of Damnation, and other sweet things
American thrash has at its center the unholy 
trinity of Slayer, Metallica, and Megadeth. This 
much is known as far as the everyday music 
fan goes. But, if one were to delve further into 
the black heart of the U.S. metal fan, a love for 
much-unheralded bands like Exodus, Testament, 
and Dark Angel would be revealed. Exodus has 
put out two mighty fine albums recently  one 
could say Gary Holt's finest work since Bonded 
in Blood, perhaps. Testament has shown that no 
form of metal is safe and has reformed the original 
lineup for a few festival appearances. A little less 
on the radar has been Dark Angel  specifically 
Jim Durkin. While Gene Hoglan has gone on to 
drum for Strapping Young Lad, among others, 
Durkin (guitarist extraordinaire) has not been as 
prolific in his output. After D.A. broke up in the 
early '90s, Durkin and Hoglan formed a project 
named Dreams of Damnation," which seems to 
have gradually become Durkins main focus. In 
2006, D.O.D. released Epic Tales of Vengeance. 
With new addition Loana D.P. Valencia, D.O.D. 
has emerged with a very current and urgent 
sound.
The notion of the female singer in metal has lost 
its novelty, thanks in no small part to the recent, 
stellar work of Angela Gossar (Arch Enemy), 
among others. These women have distinctive 
voices but still sound as powerful as any of 
their male counterparts. Valencias voice is no 
different. Her vocal abilities impressed me on 
this album: She mostly stays within a tight range 
familiar in the death metal genre. While not 
straying beyond the standard range, her style 
perfectly complements Durkin's quick riffing and 
the solid rhythm section behind them.
A little deeper, the arrangement and the lyrics 
that the band chose to focus on fascinate me.
This album starts off with the instrumental 
"Crimson Vengeance," a recurring theme and 
a slow build-up of rage that explodes into the 
opener, Kill for Peace." While the notion of 
political hypocrisy in war is not a novel one, 
Valencia succinctly gets her point across in 
verses like "We kill for peace  the soldiers who 
fall; were your children  not names on a wall. 
As the song segues into The Bloodletting, the 
verse "Welcome to the bloodletting/Crimson 
symphonies of our justice/Litanies to our survival/ 
Blister... in our hate rings in my head.
One gets the feeling that Valencia has been 
carrying these lyrics in her mind and heart for 
some time now. The semi-sexual yet violent The 
New Flesh is a case in point: Seductive in its 
calling/You long to taste the sting/Of whips that 
kiss like angels/Reborn with darkened wings. In 
Patricide, this anger reaches its apex. The title 
alone should evoke deep emotions from anyone, 
but the lyrics themselves leave me angry and 
saddened. Juxtaposed with the violence in all 
the other songs here and sequenced right after
"The New Flesh, one gets the sense that this 
is a subject matter that weighs heavily on her 
thoughts. I will say that listeners should read 
the lyrics to take meaning for themselves: Im 
certainly not one to misinterpret an artist's words. 
War as child abuse, however, is not a thought we 
discuss in our society, although it makes sense 
here. When I think of child soldiers, I see images 
of young African boys conscripted and sent off to 
fight a war they need no part of. Yet anyone who 
goes off to war comes back scarred, and their 
vision of reality is forever scarred, too. D.O.D. 
is arguing that to take away ones innocence is 
indeed child abuse.
The anger employed here touches a nerve, one 
that I hadnt thought existed in me. Metal in 
general is often used as a cathartic release for 
listeners and performers alike. Epic Tales of 
Vengeance is an album that strikes a little harder 
in me, and I hope youll give it a little of your 
time, too.
Until next time,

Teaspoons were at a premium, wrote The Tartan, 
as teaspoons were apparently disappearing from 
campus cafeterias at an alarming rate. The article 
continued, This is what used to happen to pep
per shakers, too. So when students realized that 
no amount of pepper would help the food, they 
turned to stealing silverware in protest?
Spring Fling, the H&SS version of the Beaux Arts 
Bail, was this weeks highlight and featured George

heavy black eyeliner, David-Bowie-inspired coif
fures, and stiletto platforms, danced to Tainted 
Love and Bette Davis Eyes. Carnegie Mellons 
food service even catered the event, serving what 
the paper called unobjectionable veal parmigian. 
Clearly, Carnegie Mellons food has lost some of its 
zeal since then, but thankfully the school has not 
compromised its dancing skills or style.

nience stores, The Tartan found that our university 
really stood out this year. Forget academic stand
ings: Carnegie Mellon was among the 25 schools 
with the highest sales of cigarettes. It was projected 
that $175,000 was spent on the product, which is 
equivalent to 51,400 packs a year. Judging by the 
plumes of smoke wafting around outside Doherty 
Hall these days, it seems that students are still 
helping to keep our school in the top 25.
The Tartan rated crappy beers in honor of Carnival 
season, during which crappy beers are synony
mous with a good time. If a few dry frats this year 
say they miss their Natty, dig up the old article, in 
which the beverage was described to be as foul as 
a fat ugly friend. Just remember that during the 
break next week, if you choose to try out Buggy, 
Booth, and a beer: Be respectable; use the proper 
receptacle.

The Carnegie Tech that almost was
Original concept designs reveal a strange campus
history..... Thanks to the Hunt Library's Architectural Journal collection for information and images.
pillbOX 4.17.06
2006 marks the 100th anniversary of many important 
Carnegie Mellon institutions and traditions. The 
creation of the College of Fine Arts, the founding of 
The Tartan, and even the construction of the school's 
first buildings took place in the year 1906. Although 
the founding of the Carnegie Technical Schools took 
place in 1900 with Andrew Carnegies proposal to 
fund the school, it was another five years before the 
groundbreaking of the campus itself.
In the intervening time, land was acquired from the city 
of Pittsburgh (30 acres adjoining Schenley Park) and a 
competition was held between prominent architects to 
create a design for the campus. The land had originally 
been a farm, and at one time Joncaire Street and later 
Woodlawn Avenue  one section of which we now 
know as Margaret Morrison Street  ran through this 
property.
Looking at the other competition entries, it is easy to 
see why Hornbostels proposal won the contest. Aside 
from being the most aesthetically appealing of all the 
entries, he took great care in designing the layout of 
the buildings. He took a similar approach to Thomas 
Jeffersons University of Virginia campus, creating a 
lawn or mall flanked by the various academic buildings. 
The buildings all had a similar architectural style and 
adjoined what is today known as Frew Street; the land 
up to Forbes Avenue had not yet been acquired by the 
School. A pillared grand entrance was to be located on 
Frew Street, about where the Hunt Library stands today.
All of the competition entries gave the campus a 
prominent feature: a tower, usually as a part of the 
administration building. Strangely, Hombostels original 
plan did not include the familiar tower of Hamerschlag 
Hall that we all know today, but rather a small power 
plant.
One of the original intents of the Schools location 
was to have easy access to the Carnegie Library and 
Museums across Junction Hollow, and the different 
competition entries treated this relationship differently. 
While many simply relied on the bridge just south of 
campus and near Phipps Conservatory, some proposed 
bridges stretching across the Hollow to the buildings. In 
one design, the bridge was simply an extension of the 
mall.
Henry Hornbostel, then in New York, was the 
competition's winner. Before construction, he revised
his designs, adding a distinctive tower at the Junction 
Hollow end of campus. In April 1905, groundbreaking 
began. By the time the first students came to campus 
in October 1905, construction was underway on what 
is now Porter Hall. In Hombostels revised design, a tall 
tower was to go at the west end of the building, but for 
whatever reason it was never built. In another revised 
design from around 1912, a very similar-looking tower 
was proposed on the current site of the Hunt Library, 
which was to be the Administration tower.
Another notable feature of 1912s redesign is the 
campus connection to Forbes Avenue. The obstacle of 
connecting to this important street was a deep ravine 
which ran from what is today Newell-Simon Hall up 
to the tennis courts beside Margaret Morrison. The 
proposed solution in the new design was an extension 
of Morewood Avenue into the campus, including a 
bridge over the ravine. This idea, too, was discarded, 
and Morewood was left to end at Forbes. Soon a portion 
of the ravine was filled in, creating another section of 
the Mall.
Henry Hornbostel decided to move his architectural 
practice to Pittsburgh. He stayed at Carnegie Tech as 
the first Dean of Fine Arts. He also designed the new 
University of Pittsburgh campus (only partially realized), 
the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial and Hotel Webster 
Hall, among many other recognizable local and national 
projects. He continued to design all of the CIT campuss 
major buildings, and saw to it that his original purpose 
for the schools design was upheld. It is difficult to say 
what he would think of todays Carnegie Mellon, but his 
influence is still felt. When placement of the Walking 
to the Sky" statue threatened to break the unity of the 
Mall he designed, the reasoning behind Hombostels 
design was used as a primary argument against the' 
artworks installation. As a result, the proposed location 
of "Walking to the Sky moved from the Mall to the front 
of the Cut.
Henry Hornbostels design was the official 
selection. His initial plan (left) featured a 
T-shaped main quad and a connecting 
dormitory quad. The main entrance to the 
school would have been on Frew Street, 
about where Hunt Library is today. The 
design featured a large Administration 
building (below), which was much more 
ornate than anything actually built. His 
revised design from about 1912 (above) 
proposed that Morewood Avenue be 
extended through campus.
All design submissions featured large central buildings, though none were actu
ally built. This design was made by architects Carrere & Hastings.
Many submissions, such as this one by Howells & Stokes, featured very little 
space for a central lawn, a major feature of Hornbostels plan.

what they could have been.

Performer, writer, power artist
Saul Williams brings words to life in Rangos Hall
It may not occur to us that something exists someplace in 
between performance and the page. That one can be neither 
actor nor writer, but an amalgam of both of these labels.
When we look at Keanu Reeves deadpan face we may forget 
that performance should imply the power and command of 
words and actions. When we read the introduction to Heart of 
Redness, we may forget that words and actions on the page 
can be brought to life.
Saul Williams brings words to life. He is half performer, half 
writer, all power. No more than three feet from the front row 
of seats in Rangos Hall Wednesday night he was positively 
booming. No mic was on, but his power was turned up.
Never mind his words for a moment. Well get to them. Focus 
on, instead, the sound of Saul Williams. He shoots his words 
like a Gatling gun, and they drop off his Ups so quick you 
almost miss them. In "Telegram, from his self-titled album, 
he pierces your ears with the sounds of the stops between 
phrases of his letter to hip-hop. "Perhaps we should not have 
encouraged them to use cordless microphones, for they have 
walked too far from the source and are emitting a lesser 
frequency, he said at the top of his voice, then he punctuated 
it once more with "stop. If you focused on his lips, you got 
dizzy from the movement. The man can fly.
Yet the words are impressive too. Theyre so fast you wish you 
had the lyrics in front of you, to look over and go back to. You 
wish Williams had a rewind button so you could capture it all 
again. Luckily, a lot of his stuff may be downloaded from the 
iTunes Music Store. He dives into what's wrong with hip-hop, 
yet during the constant flow of questions between poems he 
said hed rather not tune out to music. Ill take it verse by 
verse, even line by line, he said of his process in deciding 
whether he could like something of an artists work. Hes part 
philosopher in his subject matter too, in speaking of a female 
Messiah. Hes part eulogizer as well, ending his piece "Coded  
Language with the words, "Any utterance will be un-aimed, 
will be disclaimed  two rappers slain."
After hearing him one time, you can read his lyrics and
remember clearly how he punched them out, where he 
stopped to breathe, and where you could not believe he did 
not.
Williams brought Carnegie Mellon something it simply does 
not have in high supply. Williams occupies a particular voice, 
a combination of rhythm and word choice, emphasis and 
eloquence. It is doubtful that the talented music majors here 
will get their hip-hop education in the classroom. And slam 
poetry is an outlier in creative writing.
We have a whole center named after collaborative innovation, 
and this man/poet/performer epitomizes it. Williams combines 
the force of poetry with acting and with protesting. He has 
practiced in various media forms, from his lead role in the film 
Slam to his recurring appearance on the show Giilfhends to 
his music and poetry CDs to his books, such as The Seventh 
Octave.
Williams is working currently on a CD with Trent Reznor 
of Nine Inch Nails, in which Reznor may sing some of the 
lyrics and they will work to create the music behind it.
In Rangos Hall last Wednesday, though, no music played 
behind Williams. It was just the audience, the room, and the 
electricity of his voice.
Williams creates in his various forms and fashions something 
unique to a performance medium. You cannot describe what 
he says, only listen to it. You cannot tell how the sounds drop 
with a cadence or a clatter from his lips.
Though his performance was powerful, his answers to 
questions were human and hard to follow through his talk of 
self-actualizing (which is what Williams professes life is all 
about). And he admitted to not knowing the answers, then 
ironically followed this statement with 10-minute responses. 
He started as an actor and didnt write until his early 20s, he 
said. And when asked to explain how he balanced the two, he 
struggled. Perhaps because for Williams, the performance and 
the lyrics have become inseparable. Though it's hard to knock 
him, its also hard to see his words having such magic on
the page. He describes his book The Dead Emcee Scrolls as 
the dopest hip-hop album never recorded. But in truth, its 
in the very listening that it comes alive. Maybe it was never 
recorded, but it cannot be real without Saul Williams' sound.
You can't tell someone what Saul Williams sounds like. Listen 
to clips of his poetry on www.saulwilliams.com.

Gain and ABel
The campus buzz that followed the Activities Board (AB) showing 
of Pirates and Marty Griffin's subsequent obsession is as tired 
as the stars who made the actual film. "I didnt think it was that 
big of a deal. They didn't need to stress it that much, said BSA 
sophomore Erin Weideman. When your daily pirates AND 
porn AND carnegie mellon" Google search takes you to www. 
pomeditorials.com, youll find an article in which the director of 
Pirates, Joon  who, like Jesus, is popular enough to pull off the 
one-name deal  attributes the commotion to his film's explosive 
budget and great cast. Activities Board chair Andrew Moore 
is quoted in the article, originally published in the UW-Madison 
Badger-Herald.
This semesters showing of another TBA porn brought with it 
more chalked sidewalks and Doherty posters, only this time they 
didnt have busty vixens luring patrons and their $1 bills. Christian 
organizations offered alternative activities to the porn, countering 
the money shots in McConomy Auditorium with a screening of the 
unflinching 2005 Best Picture winner Crash.
they seem to do is recall the forgettable days of junior high dances 
and parentally advised Coolio CDs. But radio stations across the 
country, especially those run by high schools and colleges, are 
vigilant in making sure Drop It Like It's Hot skips a few beats 
before reaching your eardrums. The motivation for this extra 
caution? A newly launched crusade against them  only this time, 
the battle armor is some stationery and the sword a swift pen.
Radio stations from coast to coast have found themselves in a 
David-and-Goliath matchup against organizations out to shut 
down their airwaves. With strict sanctions being religiously upheld 
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), media outlets 
are paying the price for violations such as on-air cursing (which we 
all know can slip out as easily as, say, Janet Jackson's nipple at the 
Super Bowl).
Christian institutions have led the charge against these smallerstaffed stations, which often do not have the budget to compete 
in a legal stoning. But what could quickly be interpreted as 
a metaphorical attempt to guide these children  with their 
drinking of spirits and fraternizing with women of ill repute  to 
the Light is more like a battle for the airwaves.
Carnegie Mellons own WRCT has not been completely immune 
to the frequency fight. Stories have circulated around the station 
for years of a band of zealous right-wing fanatics, Pat Robertson 
manifestos in hand, pocket New Testaments in tow, who in the 
'90s were determined to take down WRCT  and succeeded. 
General manager Matt Siko explained a less titillating tale. WRCT's 
frequency, 88.3, stepped on the sandaled toes of and caused 
interference with the neighboring station 88.1, He's Alive radio.
It was not a Frankenstein serial.
The rumor goes that this Christian station would have volunteers 
sit in two-hour segments and listen to WRCT, waiting for us 
to commit a violation to report, Siko said. WRCTs directional 
broadcasting, accentuated toward the east,.resulted in some 
mixed airwaves  which just meant some fu%y Scripture might 
interrupt the chorus of that song by that band Ipji didnt know the 
name of anyway.Samson said "Get off the air

being taken down by challenging Christian groups, Siko remains 
confident of WRCTs safe standing. "We do a good job, he said, 
crediting their unassailable programming to "station management 
[being] cognizant of FCC law.
We are a force for good, said Siko, which probably isnt too far 
from what the Goliaths are arguing, too.
Jonah and the babe
So it's kind of like American Idol, only the idol in question is 
an actual one, and He would probably only be classified as an 
American by some government officials. The new A&E show God 
or the Girl already faced harsh criticism before it aired on Easter 
Sunday. And theyre not even bitching about the missing question 
mark!
The show follows four men  none of whom are named Matthew, 
Mark, Luke, or John  as they embark on a spiritual quest to 
determine whether to devote their lives to the Big Guy Upstairs. 
The Girl part of the title is a reference to the girlfriends the 
would-be celibates are contemplating leaving, not some reality 
show test where the holy rookies are strapped to a chair with 
their eyelids pulled back and subjected to a slideshow of Sears 
underwear advertisements.
This will help the public see that when a man decides to go into 
the seminary, it takes some time and prayer. He has to ask himself 
questions like, Do I want to get married?, 'Do I want to stay 
single? said Father Tom Burke, vocation director at the Diocese 
of Pittsburgh. Burke works with men considering the priesthood. 
The title of the show, he says, "sounds strong," and he believes the 
program will ultimately prove beneficial for all viewers curious to 
see what drives a man to doh the white collar.
Burkes story sounds like perfect fodder for the A&E show. 
Ordained only five yea?s ago, Burke has a college degree in 
broadcasting communications, and held a gig as a radio host.
The decision to egtpr the priesthood took a year and a half full 
of job resignation! and relationship breakups. "Its not a popular 
career; people always ask me, Why are you a priest? and I have 
to respond, Why nbt? said Burke. "Hollywood and the media
focus on the materialistic society, but there are people who take a 
different route.
Cases like God or the Girl and The Da Vinci Code illustrate an 
enigmatic countertrend in the media. It used to seem like the 
church was cashing in on Hollywood, with lucrative book deals and 
increasing cooperation with the power elite. Now we have Mels 
thoughts on Christ in the top 10 box office champs of all time, and 
TV shows about modest Christians created for viewers who often 
dont want to see a real priest in person, let alone a fake one on TV.
All hail the profit
Next May, the film adaptation of Dan Browns The Da Vinci Code 
will open the Cannes Film Festival in France and probably go on to 
be a box office success of, well, Biblical proportions. Movie studios 
are noticing the immense profits that come with putting God in 
their films, even when hes a Hon you can visit only by traveling 
through a magic wardrobe.
Sermons are peppered with movie endorsements, and the box 
office benefits of these recommendations are making movies, and 
not candidates, the chic thing to promote at the pulpit.
Newspaper headlines tell of another fossil found to refute 
creationist claims. Evangelical Christian John MacArthur tells 
Larry King if medical science finds homosexuality to be genetic, it 
needs to "read more Scripture." John McCain, eyeing a presidential 
run, is now buddies with Jerry Falwell, who he once deemed an 
"agent of intolerance. Maybe this religious infiltration in the media 
isnt indicative of a growing gap between believers and non
believers, but a progressive step toward mutual dependence. The 
Word  and the money  is being spread.
The extent of religions consumerism is as unpredictable as an 
atheist screening of Sister Act. Perhaps the next question wont be 
Did Judas really betray Jesus? but Were those CK briefs Christ 
was wearing on the cross?"

Mass music clearance: The leftovers
Pillbox reviews a little bit of everything
Some of the perks of being a writer for the entertainment 
section of a newspaper are all of the free CDs and concert 
trips (now you want to write for us, dont you?). One of the 
downsides of being a writer for the entertainment section of a 
newspaper is that you have to wade through a lot of garbage
 from local bands with little experience to pop icon sell-outs 
and cocky wannabes  to find the diamonds in the rough. 
Here weve cleared out our stacks and summed up the talents 
(or lack thereof) of some of the latest releases from famous 
artists, first releases of others, and attempts at artistry from 
still more. Weve covered a little bit of everything, from rock to 
Christian rock to country to indie, and in the process hopefully 
saved you a bit of time and money. Read on for briefs on 
twelve CDs, and then go forth and buy or ignore.
Clear Static by Clear Static
Clear Static, the latest out of L.A.s Viper Room and Key Club, 
offers an energy-driven emo-techno throwback to the '80s on 
their self-titled debut album. Described by their distributors 
and Maverick Records label to be "like Prince in a knife fight 
with the Killers," their track "Make-Up Sex has already 
reached #16 on the Billboard Dance Chart. If you enjoy groups 
such as Depeche Mode, The Cure, and The Faint, then also 
check out their song "Tuesday on My Mind. They toured 
with Duran Duran last year and kicked off a tour of their own 
last month. To show that Pittsburghs music scene is coming 
around, this band  whose CD will be released nationally on 
May 2  played here Wednesday night at the Rex Theatre. 
Definitely procure a copy before The O.C. bastardizes it!
Carnegie Hall 4.9.02 by Ani DiFranco
When handed Carnegie Hall 4.9.02, Ani DiFrancos latest live 
solo album on "Righteous Babe Records (which is her own 
record label), another staff member remarked, Ani DiFranco... 
still angry." The statement was prophetic in that she definitely 
still is a punk folksinger delivering socio-political messages in 
her unique coffeehouse style. This CD consists of more of her 
hard-hitting, slightly raspy vocals and driving acoustic guitar, 
both of which are periodically interrupted by her interactions 
with the audience. The apex of the album comes when she 
recites her intense poem Self-Evident to a crowd of New 
Yorkers seven months after 9/11. If you enjoy her work, you 
can also look forward to her new studio album, Reprieve, to be 
released July 11.
Truth is Currency by Revelation Theory
Revelation Theory's instrumentation on its Truth is Currency 
album is strongly reminiscent of Metallica. The CD is 
unmoving in its lack of creativity and painful redundancy.
The musical inexperience of the band is obvious and, like 
every other group that insists on prolonging the headbanging, mosh-pit style of wailing lead guitars, heavy bass 
lines, shouting vocals, and forceful drumbeats, the overall 
effect is just not riveting. And, despite its amplified attempts, 
Revelation Theorys hardcore sound cannot mask the fact 
that its lyrics are devoid of anything fresh that would interest 
audiences in any way.
The Sound of You and Me by Garrison Starr
From someone who does not listen to country music and 
initially groaned when I saw Garrison Starrs album The 
Sound of You and Me, I found her CD released on Vanguard 
Records to be definitely palatable. Okay, perhaps I even liked 
itjust slightly  but in an Ill-buy-it-for-someone-elsewho-does-dig-country-music kind of way. Her studio sound is 
unlike most stereotypical country music, as it is not twangy, 
and instead highlights the clarity, gentleness, and smooth 
simplicity of her vocals and acoustic guitar strumming.
Similar to the Dixie Chicks and the Indigo Girls, her lyrics 
depict an emotional life story that is well worth listening to.
Mockingbird by Derek Webb
Christian singer/songwriter Derek Webbs fourth solo album 
on INO Records, Mockingbird, is as mellow-sounding a 
Christian CD as his previous releases. Mockingbird is being 
marketed as a musically compelling look at God, politics, and 
social issues." His gentle voice is similar to those of Vertical 
Horizon, and he has a guitar style like Jack Johnson. If you 
are interested in seeing him live, he will be performing in 
Elizabethtown, Pa., on April 28.
Get Steady by Jonny Lives!
Jonny Lives! is a group infused with NYCs Lower East Side 
sound, a scene that takes its style from Brit-Pop and has 
produced other artists like The Strokes and the Yeah Yeah 
Yeahs. On their EP Get Steady, released on the indie label 
Eleven Seven Music, the songs hold up to expectations: They 
are energetic, funky, and infectious  and able to make 
even a prep school boy enthusiastically jump around, do a 
thrashing dance, and ecstatically execute the title track, Get 
Steady, on his air guitar while jiving alone in his bedroom 
(as one does, in fact, do in the music video for that song). 
Listening to this album feels a little like hearing every other 
band in this subgenre, though no less enjoyable because of it.
Show Your Bones by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs
Speaking of bands that sound like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,
Karen O's band followed their debut Fever to Tell with a "more 
mature" album, Show Your Bones. While SYB isnt as wildly 
electric as its predecessor, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs rock just as 
hard as they have in the past. "Honeybear and the single 
"Gold Lion are probably the strongest tracks on the album, 
but Show Your Bones is one of those rare CDs where you dont 
have to skip past half the tracks. All of the praise given to 
Fever to Tell is well deserved, but the bands sophomore effort 
is pure indie-rock genius. Add this entire album to your next 
road trip soundtrack.
American Diary by Greg Joseph
The first solo album by Greg Joseph (of the Clarks) is 
essentially a cross between generic country music and the 
Barenaked Ladies. It is marketed as an 11-song collection of 
life, death, desire and broken hearts told with Joseph's
cynicism and dry humor that bring his characters to life, and 
while Im a huge fan of cynicism and dry humor, this album 
lacks both originality and the sinfully infectious melodies 
that he promises us. Generic as hell, every track leaves you 
wondering where youve heard that song before. Take our 
advice and dont waste your time or money on American 
Diary.
Was A Real Boy by Say Anything
I picked up this CD because track seven is named I Will 
Never Write An Obligatory Song About Being On The Road 
And Missing Someone. Sadly, this is the worst song on the 
album. The lyrics of the other six songs are hilarious and 
actually cynical, unlike whatever Greg Joseph thought he was 
doing. However, the album lacks the energy and flair needed 
to make this brand of emo work. I never thought Id say this, 
but Id rather listen to Fall Out Boy.
footprints by David W. Jacobson
His chord progressions are cliched, and his voice has a 
peculiarly low quality to it. The lyrics are occasionally mildly 
amusing  see Batteries, in which all of his pickup lines 
are rejected by girls who would rather spend time with their 
vibrators (Im not kidding)  but are far too melodramatic for 
the most part and not as "hilarious" as he and his label think. 
His self-described "melancholy, acoustic songwriting is a 
weak attempt at the coffeehouse music he seems to admire.
In short, if any generic high school band ever collaborated on 
an album with Phoebe Buffay, it would sound like Footprints.
Less and Less by the American Princes
The American Princes second album is a mishmash of 
classic-rock-ish and indie rock songs with the occasional 
acoustic ballad thrown in for variety. Theyre too obscure to be 
destined for greatness and definitely wont bring rock and roll 
salvation, despite what punk zine Punk Planet says. And yet, 
the bands love for pure rock and roll is evident through all 13 
tracks and makes listening to the album even more enjoyable. 
Its sole reviewer on iHmes gives it five stars out of five. Id go 
with four and a half.
Business Up Front, Party in the Back by Family Force 5
Dont be fooled by their hipster indie appearance: These 
guys are really... country? The reference to mullets in their 
album title shouldve been my first clue, but it took the lyrics 
Watch what you say to my momma, she raised me in the 
dirty South, to drive that concept home. Self-described as 
crunk rock, Family Force 5s music is hard to classify but 
sounds like the Southern bastard offspring of Kid Rock and the 
Beastie Boys. The album isnt really worth buying, but check 
out their MySpace profile if youre curious.

Planet on Friday.
The Death Star is fully operational. Watch your ass, KDR! (And use 
proton torpedos.)
The ghost of Mitch Hedberg will walk campus during Carnival, droning 
one-liners wherever Pringles are consumed and pot is smoked.
You will learn that even though Al Gore invented the Internet, it was Bill 
Clinton who put porn on it.
Youll discover that Sigma Tau Gammas Gotham City booth was 
designed by Joel Schumacher because it was the only work he could 
get after putting nipples on the Batsuit.
Carnival is broke! Youll enjoy this years cost-efficient rides, which 
include Spin Around in an Office Chair and Run to that Tree and Back.

Carnegie Mellon, Carnegie Mellon, here we coooooooomel
Your imaginary boyfriend broke up with you three weeks ago. Turns out 
you're not even popular in your own subconscious.
The artificial intelligence you installed in your mobot was a deadly idea. 
It will lead a mobot swarm invasion that will leave Pittsburgh virtually 
uninhabitable. Many of the bodies will never be recovered.
By a margin of one vote (yours!), readme and Optimus Prime will 
actually win the student body elections, readme will officially change 
Carnegie Mellons motto from My heart is in the work to Students 
here dont have sex isnt that hilarious? Optimus will win Mobot.
The new statue of Mao Yisheng outside Baker Hall will be struck by 
lightning and brought to life. He will easily scale Borofskys Walking 
to the Sky and rule Pittsburgh with an iron fist (s.o to speak) from his 
towering perch. Your last mistake will be daring to defy him.
