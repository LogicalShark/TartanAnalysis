CMU researches Facebook privacy as site goes global
by Alexander DiLeonardo 
& Rachita Chandra
Junior Staffwriters
College students may soon re
ceive a surprising e-mail in their 
inboxes: Your mom has added 
you as a friend on Facebook.
Shortly after confronting a 
strong protest against its News 
Feed feature, the creators of the 
previously exclusive social net
working site Facebook have an
nounced plans to open the sites 
doojs to everyone in the Internet 
community. Facebook has estab
lished a policy similar to those 
of other social networking sites, 
such as MySpace, and will soon 
allow users to join based on their 
affiliation with a country, state, or 
county.
However, unlike MySpace, 
Facebook will still restrict the 
viewing of other profiles; a stu
dent from Carnegie Mellon, for 
example, cannot view the pro
file of a student at the University 
of Pittsburgh unless the two are 
friends.
College networks will remain 
exclusive to people from those 
colleges. High school and work 
networks will remain exclusive as 
well. Only your friends and other 
people in your networks can see 
your profile, wrote Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, in 
a statement on the site last week. 
This is what makes Facebook dif
ferent, and were not changing 
it.
Current members are not so 
convinced that opening Facebook 
to a broader audience wont have 
a negative effect.
Privacy is an important part
of a persons life, said Abhishek 
Parikh, a first-year chemical en
gineering major, adding that he 
is worried that broadening Face
book membership may affect the 
privacy of its current members.
Recently, Carnegie Mellon re
searchers examined just that. 
Ralph Gross, a Ph.D. candidate 
in software engineering, and 
Alessandro Acquisti, a professor 
of information technology and 
public policy at the Heinz School, 
produced a research paper titled 
Awareness, Information Sharing, 
and Privacy of Facebook that ex
amined the way Facebook users
perceive their privacy.
According to Gross, close to 50 
percent of Facebook users sur
veyed gave the wrong answer 
when asked about who could view 
their Facebook profile.
The researchers also found that 
most students tried to protect their 
privacy by controlling the infor
mation they revealed to the online 
community, rather than adjusting 
the sites privacy controls. When 
survey highlighted potential pri
vacy concerns, only about 5 per
cent subsequently changed their 
online behavior.
The current default options in 
Facebooks privacy features are 
reasonable, Gross said, adding 
that the current options serve as 
an incentive for non-Facebook 
users to join. [There is] a direct 
trade-off between the success 
of Facebook and its privacy set
tings.

in the School of Computer Sci
ence, has established through an

Application Denied # Application Accepted
Newest Gates Center 
designs released
by Karin Xie
Junior Staffwriter
Obscured by mounds of soil 
and a steep slope, behind the 
Purnell Center for the Arts lies 
a valley with a nearly 75-foot 
drop.
This difficult terrain will 
be the birthplace of the Gates 
Center for Computer Science 
three years from now. It will be 
the convergence point of the 
West Campus Quad, bound
ed by Doherty Hall, NewellSimon Hall, Smith Hall, and 
the Collaborative Innovation 
Center (CIC). The most recent 
updates on the Gates Center 
blog present the long-awaited 
renderings of the exterior skin 
and interior designs, as well 
as plans for additional green 
space.
The new Gates Center, 
designed by architect firm 
Mack Scogin Merrill Elam, will 
have a faade of dark zinc with 
contrasting light zinc outlining 
the glass windows. A half-scale 
sample of a window, framed 
within the light and dark zinc 
edges, resembles a large, stand
alone antique mirror.
The play of the light zinc 
against the dark exterior really 
punches out the windows, said 
Ralph Horgan, vice-provost for 
Campus Design and Facility 
Development. Roughly 50 
percent of the exterior will be 
covered with windows, and 
the inherent reflectivity of zinc 
will play with light at different
times of the day.
The black-and-white ren
derings of the interior show 
how the building utilizes nat
ural daylight. With spiraling 
ramps as its core navigation 
system, the interior is an open 
social environment with large, 
abstractly curving table tops.
The interior is a concen
trated space that improves 
collaboration and promotes 
interaction, said Guy Blelloch, 
professor and associate dean 
for planning in the School of 
Computer Science (SCS). He 
also pointed out the spacious 
hallways complete with floorto-ceiling windows to help stu
dents orient themselves in the 
building.
Now a definitive depar
ture from the original campus 
architect Henry Hornbostels 
yellow brick signature style, 
the modern design will con
trast heavily with its buff-brick 
neighbors and present a new 
experience to a campus used 
to seeing Baker and Doherty 
Halls.
The faade of the structure 
facing Forbes Avenue will be 
Carnegie Mellons most stan
dard presentation to the com
munity, Horgan said. It will 
read as an office building and 
a member of the enclosed 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
According to Horgan, the 
landscape architect has exceed

expectations. Designed by

Bill may ban smoking 
in Pittsburgh eateries
S|p|I

Junior Staffwriter
In Pittsburghs restaurants, 
the question Smoking or 
non? may soon be a thing of 
the past.
Earlier this month, the 
Allegheny County Council 
met to explore public opinion 
on a bill enacting smoking 
restrictions. The council will 
vote on the bill at the end of 
this month. If it passes, res
taurants and bars throughout 
the city will have to prohibit 
smoking in their establish
ments.
According to the council 
website, any individual who 
violates the mandates of 
the proposed ordinance will 
first be warned and then 
fined $25, $50, $100, and 
$200 for each subsequent of
fense. After that point, the 
Allegheny Health Depart
ment may seek additional 
penalties.
Businesses that disobey the 
smoking ban will face greater 
consequences: a warning for 
the first offense, a $250 fine 
for the second, and a $500 
fine for a third offense, 
coupled with a possible 
license suspension. 
However, the proposed 
ordinance specifies 
that establishments that 
earn 85 percent or more of 
their money annually from 
tobacco sales, such as
a cigar or hookah bar, will be 
exempt from the prospective 
prohibition.
It is unclear whether or not 
the bill will pass. A September 
6 article in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported that while 
eight of 15 council members co
sponsored the bill  enough to 
pass by majority  the council 
will need a two-thirds major
ity to override a potential veto 
from County Chief Executive 
Dan Onarato. Onarato may re
ject the bill because it does not 
cover the entire state, a fact that 
could arguably put Allegheny 
County at an economic disad
vantage.
The Tribune-Review article 
also showed that supporters of 
the bill at the council meeting 
saw public smoking as an unnec
essary activity with health risks 
for those people in the vicinity 
of the secondhand smoke.

When Harvard University 
announced last week that it 
planned to eliminate its early ac
tion policy in the fall of 2007, it 
sent college admissions offices at 
schools across the country into 
a tailspin. Now Carnegie Mel
lon, along with the almost 3000 
colleges and universities nation
wide, must decide if it will follow 
suit.
Stating that the program dis
advantaged low-income and mi
nority students, Harvard admin
istrators are the first to take such 
bold action in an attempt to level 
the college admissions playing 
field. For now, Carnegie Mellon, 
which offers binding early deci
sion plans along with an early 
admission plan for qualified high 
school juniors, plans to watchBradford L. Yankiver/Publisher

However, he is not opposed to 
new ideas: As a 35-year veteran

seem fazed by the new develop
ment. Well consider anything, 
he said, with regard to admisSee HARVARD, page A4

from the sidelines.
At Harvard, more than 50 
percent of applications are from 
early decision applicants. In con
trast, only about 1000 applica
tions out of the 19,000 that Carn
egie Mellon typically receives are

Were not in the same situa
tion that Harvard is in, said Mike 
Steidel, Carnegie Mellon director 
of undergraduate admission and
student aid.
Steidel believes that propor
tion of early decision applicants 
is not significant enough to dis
advantage students applying 
regular decision. If that propor
tion were the same as Harvards, 
however, wed have to readdress 
our current strategy, he said.
Bill Elliott, vice-president for 
enrollment, doesnt seem quick to 
jump on the bandwagon either.

Privilege
Gutenberg would 
have loved Google
/ BrBradford Yankiver
Somewhere between 40,000 and 
2 million years ago, humans began us
ing verbal communication that con
sisted of more than meaningless grunts. 
The world changed.
Six thousand years ago in what is 
now Iraq, Sumerians developed the first 
known system of writing. The world 
changed again.
Just over 560 years ago, Johannes 
Gutenberg popularized the movable 
type printing press  Bi Sheng in
vented movable type in China, 400 years 
earlier  allowing ideas to move be
tween people, places and times, with 
more speed and accuracy than ever be
fore. The world changed yet again.
Imagine what it would be like to 
bear witness to the utterance of the 
first word, the carving of the first ideo
graph, the first test-run of Gutenbergs 
press.
Its easy to point to a moment that 
represents a paradigm shift in the way 
we communicate, but its clear that 
innovations transform human society 
slowly over tens, hundreds, or even 
thousands of years. While the appear
ance of a new technology is instant, 
and we can point to that time as the 
beginning of a revolution, finding the 
way that technology blends into society 
takes time. Its slow enough that the 
lucky witnesses might not even notice 
the gravity of what lies before them. (I 
can imagine a lighthearted Gutenberg 
overlooking the dramatic importance of 
his new machine as he printed his days 
equivalent of a your mom joke for 
one of his coworkers, long before they 
ever began work on the now-revered 
Gutenberg Bible.)
Similarly, as more and more people 
around the world communicate through 
todays revolutionary technology  the 
Internet  were largely unfocused on 
how our lives will change in the next 
few decades. We have witnessed the 
birth of e-mail, the search engine, live 
chats, online news, the blog, and more. 
Yet, its the AIM chat or casual e-mail 
on our screen that occupies most of our 
thoughts about the Internet, even if we 
occasionally laud these new technolo
gies in passing. Without understating 
what the Internet does for us today, the 
Internets contribution to the way we 
live has really just begun. We are the 
lucky few who naively bear witness.
On a global scale, we still lag at 
the beginning of the paradigm. Only 
14 percent of people worldwide over 
the age of 15 use the internet, and 
many of them have only limited access. 
As the infrastructure becomes more 
broadly available and the technology 
and services become more affordable, 
the World Wide Web will truly earns 
its name and its place in the history of 
communication.
Not only are we spectators of this 
process, we have the unique chance to 
participate, whether that means join
ing the Facebook group protesting the 
News Feed or using detailed research 
of human-computer interaction to de
sign the next great web application.
New concepts of how people can in
teract though the internet are sprout
ing up in every shape, from college 
projects to corporate attempts to in
crease the bottom line. Google made 
a smarter search engine and Facebook 
helped bring online social networks 
into the mainstream. On the other end 
of the spectrum, consulting firm Booz 
Allen Hamilton developed software 
that looks for statistical patterns in the 
documents their consultants read and 
write to connect people working on 
similar projects.
As individuals, organizations, and 
corporations continue to develop and 
implement these innovations, the 
online landscape will undergo a 
dramatic change. Well see that the 
Internet itself was not the invention 
that changed the world. Its the way the 
Internet is applied that will change the 
way we live.

*Leadership Profile: Amy Shields
by Eshna Bhaduri
Junior Staffwriter
Rho Lambda, a leadership and 
honor society for sorority women, 
features individuals in a Womens 
Leadership Series based on their 
contributions to campus life and 
their achievements as role mod
els in the Carnegie Mellon and 
greater Pittsburgh communities. 
Amy Shields is the organizations 
first honoree this semester.
Amy. Shields initially had no 
interest in joining a sorority. In 
fact she first thought Greek life 
was dumb and lame. But after 
attending one meeting, her per
spective changed.
Not only is the junior social 
and decision science and inter
national relations major now in 
a sorority  Alpha Chi Omega
 but shes also president of the 
Panhellenic Council, the gov
erning body of all five of Carn
egie Mellons sororities. And her 
leadership does not stop there.
Shields passion for making a 
diffrence extends across the 
campus community.
IjMy sorority] ... gave me a 
cha ice for leadership, she said.
As a leader, Shields describes 
her: elf as straightforward and 
a pi oblem-solver. When Im in
volved with something, Im in 
it 1D0 percent. I do expect a lot 
from people I work with, but I try 
notito be hard-lined because life 
happens.
In her freshman year, Shields 
had never imagined the path her 
life would follow once she joined 
a sorrity. I was the loneliest kid 
: whole world and it made 
through recruitment, and I 
the women and theyve bein th 
me go

cornel my best friends on campus. 
I car depend on my sisters for 
ever thing, and theyve become

said.

Campus Conversation on FCEs to take place Wednesday
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
The Faculty Senate hopes campus de
mocracy will shed some light on how stu
dents feel about their classes.
This Wednesday, the third installment 
of Campus Conversations will focus on 
Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs) and 
how to improve the method of delivering 
them.
There isnt anyone who shouldnt be 
concerned with this issue, said Neil Guzy, 
a Coro Fellow in Local Democracy and a 
2006 Carnegie Mellon graduate. If stu
dents dont fill out the FCE, other students 
and professors dont benefit.
Guzy is one of the organizers of the de-- 
liberative poll, which seeks to generate a 
campus discussion in which participants 
will bring an informed opinion that will 
later be used as a consulting power.
According to Robert Cavalier, a phi
losophy professor and co-director of the 
Southwestern Pennsylvania Program for 
Deliberative Democracy, the idea for de
want to eventually move back to 
D.C. Id be very sad if I werent 
near my family, she said.
Moving back home is a very 
realistic plan for the political sci
ence major who found inspiration 
in living close to the countrys 
capital. Shields plans to work in a 
non-profit organization after col
lege, though shes still consider
ing where she wants to channel 
her energy. Shes considering 
non-profit work in the govern
ment, the Peace Corps, and vari
ous think tanks, which she said 
are organizations that examine 
different issues and suggest solu
tions.
Last year, she got a taste of 
governmental life by work
ing on Capitol Hill for lobbyist 
Amy Hammer. Specifically, she 
worked on environmental issues, 
but in the future shed prefer to 
work on human rights, namely 
womens and minorities.
It is her need to do something

liberative polling on campus began with 
President Jared Cohons Diversity Advi
sory Council.
We began to see that active random 
sampling creates a diverse background for 
perspectives, Cavalier said.
In the poll, participants receive infor
mation about a subject, gather in ran
domly sampled groups, discuss questions 
with experts on the topic, and take an exit 
poll. Policy makers then consult the polls 
results to reach decisions about the sub
ject.
The benefit of the poll, Cavalier said, 
is the sense of democracy that it creates, 
allowing students and faculty to voice in
formed opinions.
According to Cavalier, topics grow 
Dut of current campus discussion. Last 
fall, the first deliberative poll focused on 
moral values in campus life in regard to 
student file-sharing, and this spring, the 
topic of discussion was the Academic Bill 
of Rights.
What we can do with the deliberative 
poll is create the opportunity for students 
to become informed, Cavalier said. But
students are not the only ones who gain 
knowledge on the subject  faculty also 
participate in the discussion, allowing the 
groups opinions to interact.
The process invites synthesis from var
ious levels, Guzy said. Its fundamentally 
important to have a wide range of partici
pants in the process.
According to Guzy, the Faculty Senate 
suggested holding a deliberative poll on 
FCEs in order to find a way to increase stu
dent participation.
After the FCEs moved from a hard-copy 
delivery to an online method, many pro
fessors stopped trusting the evaluations, 
according to a handout generated by Cav
alier and the Coro Center for Civic Leader
ship.
With student participation below 30 
percent, most felt only those students who 
strongly liked or hated a class filled out an 
evaluation.
When FCEs moved online, they became 
an optional method of feedback for stu
dents to fill out on their own time. Prior to 
this, professors had distributed paper cop
ies of the evaluation for students to fill out
while in class.
Following Wednesdays Campus Con
versation, the Faculty Senate will use 
the polls results to make recommenda
tions to the provost on the format of the 
FCEs.
Cavalier said the idea of deliberative 
polling is spreading to universities across 
the country. This fall, he will publish an 
article about his work on the Campus Con
versation in The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
Cavalier and the Coro Center are also 
working on a proposal with a ward in 
south Pittsburgh. If approved, they will 
take the deliberative poll to the larger 
community this spring to examine local 
issues in the ward.
Democracy is such hard work to get 
everyone involved and make it look easy,' 
he said.
The poll, titled Campus Conversations: 
A Deliberative Poll on Faculty Course 
Evaluations and the Methods of Deliv
ering Them, will take place in Porter 
Hall 100 on Wednesday from 5:30 to 
8:30 p.m.

their gender, five-digit ZIP code, 
and date of birth are available, 
according to Gross, who pointed 
out that these pieces of informa
tion are often visible on a Face
book profile.
This risk would be further 
increased if sensitive profile in. formation is made available to 
an even wider range of user as 
part of the global Facebook, 
she said.
In addition to privacy issues, 
students are concerned with 
preserving the elite atmosphere 
that Facebook has created by 
previously limiting its member
ship to students and employees 
of large companies.
Letting everyone on Face
book kind of ruins the novelty, 
said junior computer science 
major Sateja Parulekar, be
cause then its just like MySpace 
or Friendster.
Despite the seemingly over
whelming negative response 
that Facebook has received to 
the announcement of plans to 
open to a larger audience, some 
students support the idea.
I think that it is a good idea 
that Facebook is now going 
global, said Shelly Kucherer, a 
sophomore psychology major. 
It will be nice to connect with 
more people from areas that I 
had not gotten in touch with.
Current Carnegie Mellon stu
dents are not the only ones ex
cited about the social network
 some alumni are looking for
ward to logging on and creating 
a profile. Patrick Marinaccio, 
who graduated in 1979, is op
timistic about the future of the 
newly global social network now 
that he is eligible to join.
The value of Facebook to all 
users grows exponentially with 
its reach, he said. Imagine that 
the European and U.S. phone 
networks couldnt call each 
other. Privacy and exclusivity 
would be. enhanced, but useful
ness drastically compromised.
Congratulations!

Plans revealed for Gates Center interior and landscapeCity Council 
considering 
smoking ban
SMOKING, from Al
Locally, some students find 
secondhand smoke a nuisance. 
I wore a sweater to Shady Grove 
Bar, said Max Martinelli, a se
nior in history and mathemat
ics. After spending the night at 
a friends, my sweater reeked so 
badly of smoke the next morn
ing that I couldnt even wear it 
on the walk home.
However, according to a Sep
tember 6 article in the Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette, those in 
opposition argue that smoking 
bans violate their civil liberties 
and infringe on the rights of 
small business owners.
Im not making anyone walk 
through that door, said Eugene 
DePasquale, longtime bar
tender and owner of the Panther 
Hollow Inn on Forbes Avenue in 
Oakland. Its their decision to 
come in here.
But not all workers are re
sentful of the ban.
I would love it if they out
lawed smoking. I cant stand 
smoke, said Paolo Rossi, a chef 
at Panther Hollow Inn. I hate 
the smell  it gives me a head
ache and makes me sick. But I 
have to make a living. 
Meanwhile, DePasquale does 
not think a smoking ban will af
fect business at the bar/restau
rant.
The only reason theyre do
ing this is because they cant 
solve any other problems and 
they want to seem like theyre 
accomplishing something, he 
said.
Dan Gilmour, a senior in 
civil and environmental engi
neering and biomedical engi
neering, worked in a New Jer
sey bar over the summer and 
experienced some frustration 
with the ban.
Even though New Jersey 
prohibited smoking in bars, we 
were always reminding people 
to take their cigarettes outside. 
Sometimes people just wouldnt 
listen.
GATES, from A1
Michael Van Valkenburgh 
Associates, the site makes the 
building easily accessible to the 
community while still maintain
ing its privacy exclusive to aca
demic institutions.
The proposed landscape 
will expand the planned green 
space from 52,209 square feet 
to 120,100 square feet. The new 
landscape will include a winter 
garden, several groves of trees, 
green roofs, recreational pati
os, and a volleyball court near 
Newell-Simon Hall.
The unique topography of the 
West Quad will allow a multi-level 
stormwater management system, 
and its most innovative feature 
will be the Rain Garden. Filled 
with wetland plants that thrive 
in moisture, the garden will filter 
out soils and gravel before storm
water enters the drain.

sions policies. Weve never done 
the same thing twice.
Harvard is eliminating the pro
gram because university officials 
feel it disadvantages low-income 
and minority students, according 
to a Sept. 12 article in The New 
York Times. Early admission ap
plicants had historically been dis
proportionately white and afflu
ent, and students of well-reputed 
high schools who were savvy 
about the admissions process.
Binding early decision pro
grams, such as Carnegie Mellons, also prevent students with 
financial need from applying, be
cause they are unable to compare 
financial aid packages from other 
schools.
The quality of advising and 
counseling a student receives 
at their secondary school has a 
bigger bearing than finances, 
Steidel said. He also noted that 
if a student accepted early deci
sion and does not have the abil
ity to pay, the admissions office 
has been known to release the 
student from the binding com
mitment so he or she can attend a 
school that fits his or her finances 
better.
Kids who apply early decision

Since its early planning stages, 
the Gates Centers design has 
created much discussion among 
the computer science and archi
tecture faculty. Volker Hartkopf, 
professor of architecture and 
director of the Center for Building 
Performance and Diagnostics at 
Carnegie Mellon, has been forth
right in his criticism of the build
ings design.
In his April FOCUS article, 
Hartkopf encouraged the SCS 
review board, to seriously con
sider utilizing local industries, 
improving sustainability and 
energy efficiency with possible 
on-site energy creation, and pre
serving the pedestrian quality of 
the surrounding areas.
According to University engi
neer Marty Altschul, who is close

ning process, Hartkopfs greener,

added.
Last fil, 17.2 percent of the in
coming lass had been accepted 
early de ision. This is in line with 
the nafonal average: Highly
competitive colleges typically 
admit about 20 percent of appli
cants through early programs, 
according to a September 13 ar
ticle in The Chronicle of Higher 
Education.
Steidel thinks Harvards deci
sion will be heavily discussed 
at the National Association for, 
College Admission Counselings 
(NACAC) national conference, to 
be held next month at the David 
L. Lawrence Convention Center 
in downtown Pittsburgh. Steidel, 
Elliott, and six other members of 
the admissions staff plan to at
tend, along with thousands of 
high school and college admis
sion counselors from schools na
tionwide.
A source at the NACAC said 
that there are not any specific 
presentations planned on the 
subject, but that the decision will 
certainly be discussed.
For now, Carnegie Mellon, like 
the rest of the countrys colleges 
and universities, is planning to 
watch closely how the decision 
affects admissions in the next 
several years.
We might change our minds if 
its in the best interest of Carne
gie Mellon, Steidel said. We can 
certainly learn from each other 
as we go forward.
Elliott agreed. Were going to

internationally recognized but 
not yet feasible given the budget 
constraints.
In terms of energy efficiency, 
the Gates Center can-be regarded 
as a top-notch building  in the 
United States  with a LEED 
gold rating, Altschul said. He 
believes the SCS review com
mittee has achieved its primary 
vision of quality space for every 
occupant.
We are taking incremental 
steps towards a higher standard 
 incremental steps, which 
means we are not there yet, said 
Barbara Kviz, the Green Practices 
Committee co-chair.
In regards to the 150,000 
square feet of prospective green 
space, both Altschul and Kviz 
stressed that the plan is not yet 
finalized and noted that the bud
get constraint may not allow the 
green roof atop the structure fac
ing Forbes Avenue.
The hurdle encountered here 
between energy performance and
financial barriers is a growing 
phenomenon in the United States. 
Whereas the European Union has 
implemented low-energy build
ing laws and regulations, the U.S. 
government is lagging behind 
with merely a voluntary LEED 
certification.
Bearing the Gates name and 
budgeted at $88.6 million, the 
Gates Center will be the most 
expensive structure yet on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
The seven-story Gates Center 
will be horizontally sliced into 
three jutting layers above ground 
and supported by massive can
tilevers and additional columns. 
Its sibling, the four-story building 
Donor X, will be a more conser
vative trapezoidal structure and 
a fundraising opportunity up for 
grabs.

Virgin limits laptop 
use on planes
Virgin Atlantic became the 
third airline to restrict the use 
of certain laptops last week. 
Passengers are prohibited from 
boarding planes with Dell In
spirons and Latitudes, as well as 
Apple iBooks, PowerBooks, MacBooks, and MacBook Pros with 
the batteries still connected.
The news comes after Dell 
and Apple issued a recall on cer
tain notebook computer batter
ies manufactured by Sony. The 
recall occurred after the discov
ery that the batteries could selfcombust.
Instead, passengers who 
wish to take those computers 
on board will have to separate 
the battery from the computer 
during the flight. Furthermore, 
passengers are limited to taking 
a maximum of two batteries on 
board.
Virgin plans to lift the restric
tion as soon as the issue with the 
batteries is cleared up.

Scienists discover 
puffy planet
Astronomers are once again 
debating the properties of a 
planet. A question arose last 
week when astronomers found 
a new planet with a much lower 
density than other planets.
The object is called HAT-P-1, 
and was found to have roughly 
1.38 times the radius of Jupiter, 
but only half the mass. Scientists 
speculate that the planet has ap
proximately one-quarter the 
density of water.
HAT-P-1 is one of the 200 
planets found outside of our 
solar system. It takes approxi
mately 4.5 Earth days to orbit its 
parent star.

How Things Work: Credit cards
David Chen
Many Americans enjoy the 
convenience of using credit 
cards, but the workings of the 
credit card system are often a 
mystery.
A typical credit card transac
tion is completed in just a couple 
seconds, but the process involves 
several devices, a communica
tions network, and a specific set 
of standards.
The credit card was first cre
ated in the 1920s as a way to 
identify customers and keep 
track of items sold on credit. 
The original credit card was 
much less complicated than the 
modern credit card. It did not 
involve any automation or pro
cessing network, so each store 
maintained its own credit sys
tem.
In the 1970s, innovations 
including the magnetic stripe 
were added to create the credit 
card that is widely recognized 
today. The development of uni
versal credit cards, or cards that 
can be used at many stores, was 
finally possible.
The universal credit card is 
based on the ability to share a 
common record between differ
ent stores. This is accomplished 
with the magnetic stripe. The 
magnetic stripe is the black 
stripe on the back of a credit 
card.
The stripe contains many 
small magnetic particles embedded in the plastic. Each par
ticle is less than 20-millionths 
of an inch long. The orientation 
of each magnetic particle deter
mines what data are stored.
There are three tracks of data 
in a magnetic stripe. Each track 
is approximately one-tenth of an 
inch wide. The first and second 
tracks of the stripe are encoded 
with information about the 
cardholders account, includ
ing the full name, credit card 
number, expiration date, and 
country code. The third track 
can be used to store additional 
information.
Not all credit cards store 
data in a magnetic stripe. Some <
newer technologies to supple
ment or replace the magnetic 
stripe have been introduced, but 
most are not yet in common use 
in the United States.
Smart-chip technologies al
low additional information such 
as frequent shopper discounts to 
be stored on the credit card.
Contactless technologies al
low credit cards to be used sim
ply by placing the card close to 
a card reader. Contactless card 
readers have recently been in
troduced to many convenience 
stores.
Regardless of the method of 
storing data on a credit card, the 
card is not functional without a

device to read and use the infor
mation.
Most retail stores use a device 
called a point-of-sale terminal. 
The point-of-sale terminal is 
typically a device with a card 
swipe reader and, optionally, a 
signature capture pad.
When a card is swiped 
through the terminal, the cus
tomers credit card information 
is transmitted to the acquirer, 
the bank that handles the credit 
card transaction. This is done 
through a dial-up modem phone 
connection or a dedicated net
work connection.
The acquirers comupters use 
the transmitted information to
check the cardholders account 
to make sure that it is in good 
standing and has enough credit 
available for the purchase. The 
acquirer then sends an authori
zation response, indicating the 
approval status of the transac
tion, and if declined, a reason 
code.
There are also alternativ? 
credit card processing method; 
that do not require the physic 1 
credit card to be present, but a 1 
involve the same process of cor - 
tacting the acquirer.
Merchants may process cred t 
cards via a phone system thit 
calls designated phone number 
and dials in required informjtion for the charge, including 
the credit card number, expration date, and amount to b? 
charged.
Another method that : s 
quickly gaining popularity is th; 
virtual terminal. A virtual te - 
minal allows the transaction t) 
be completed over a'website ii - 
terface. These two methods ai; 
especially useful for business s 
that do not see their custome: s 
in person, such as mail-ordir 
and e-commerce stores.
Credit cards are designed n 
be easy to use, so most of tf 2 
process is completely transpa - 
ent to the customer. Howeve -, 
occasional problems with tie 
system do surface. Netwo:k 
downtimes and equipme: it

credit card transactions fro n 
taking place.
Assistant Professors work featured in national magazine
MAGAZINE, from A6
Ahn works to combine human 
reasoning with computer com
putation.
If you have ever registered 
for Yahoo! e-mail or purchased 
baseball tickets, then you have 
probably come across one of 
von Ahns developments, called 
CAPCHTA.
Completely Automated Public 
Turing test to tell Computers and 
Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is 
a technique used to distinguish 
computers from humans.
It can also be used to secure 
online polls and e-mail accounts 
from bots or machine hackers.
Using this technique, the com
puter presents the user with the 
image of a distorted word. It then 
asks the user to type the word. 
The technique works because 
computers are unable to accu
rately read the distorted word. 
But people without visual im
pairments possess such ability.
Popular Science called von Ahn 
the matrix builder for his work
in artificial intelligence. The 
magazine said that while most 
artificial intelligence research
ers try to make computers imi
tate humans, von Ahn moves in 
the other direction.
When computers arent 
enough to accomplish a task, von 
Ahn turns to humans, showing 
just how closely machines and 
minds work together.
He harnesses tens of thou
sands of peoples reasoning skills 
for those rare yet important jobs 
that are too important for com
puters, Popular Science stated.
Labeling every image on the 
Internet is an overly demanding 
task for computers, but its not 
for von Ahn and the rest of the 
online gaming world.
Von Ahn recently created the 
ESP Game iwww.espgame.org) 
for exactly this purpose.
The ESP Game is an online 
program that presents randomly 
paired partners with an identi
cal set of 15 pictures. Each part
ner must submit labels for the 
pictures without knowing the 
guesses of the other person. If
two partners guess the same la
bel, then the picture is given that 
name.
Von Ahn is undoubtedly a 
computer gamer. Another of his 
developments is the online game 
Peekaboom. The object of the 
game is for one partner, Boom, 
to reveal an image to his part
ner, Peek, so that Peek can guess 
the image. Partners try to get 
through as many pictures as they 
can in four minutes.
Von Ahns work has appeared 
in over 100 news publications, 
and he holds four patent applica
tions.
Randal Bryant, dean of the 
School of Computer Science, said 
that von Ahn takes a different ap
proach to artificial intelligence.
While his project might seem 
to some like something done 
on a whim, its actually making 
people teach computers, Bryant 
said.
Bryant also said that von Ahn 
is a good match for Carnegie 
Mellon. We feel like it shows the 
kind of thinking that goes on in 
our institution, he said.

A closer look at von Ahns work: Google Image Labeler
by Alexandra Kiiduff
Personnel Manager
On September 1, Google in
troduced the Google Image La
beler, an online game that in
vites players to label untagged 
images in the Google Image 
Search database. Carnegie Mel
lon students may find the game 
strangely familiar; thats be
cause it was developed by Luis 
von Ahn, an assistant professor 
in the computer science depart' ment and the creator of the ESP 
Game, which he licensed to
Google earlier this year.
Von Ahn specializes in hu-- 
man computation, which he 
describes as the channeling 
of humans to train and develop 
computers. For his doctoral 
and post-doctoral work at Carn
egie Mellon, von Ahn and his 
colleagues developed the ESP 
Game to help computers learn 
to identify images and words.
You learn to see because your 
parents tell you, thats a dog,  
von Ahn said. But nobody both
ers to teach computers. Thats 
where humans play an impor
tant role.
The model of the ESP Game 
and the Google Image Labeler is 
simple: A player is paired with a 
random partner online and pre
sented with a series of unnamed 
images. Each partner types in as 
many accurate labels as possible 
without knowing what his part
ner is typing.
When the two partners both 
type in.the same word, a match 
is made and the image is labeled 
with that term. Players can also 
earn points, but only to increase 
player gratification.
For von Ahn, the ESP Game is 
more than a diversion  it could
be a viable way to train com
puters to identify images. Com
puters can learn by example, 
and with online images, com
puters would have an enormous 
base of examples.
Image-sawy computers could 
be useful in medicine and secu
rity, to name just a few potential 
fields; von Ahn described the 
possibility of computers that 
could identify medical anoma
lies in X-rays or military bun
kers in aerial photographs, all 
without the aid of a human.

Trees genetic code 
deciphered
Scientists recently discovered 
the genetic code for a black cot
tonwood tree. The discovery 
could lead to a new kind of tree 
better for producing wood, pa
per, and fuel.
The black cottonwood is a 
rapidly growing poplar that is 
in high use by the timber and 
paper industries. The team of 
researchers isolated the DNA se
quence from a specimen grow
ing along the Nisqually River in 
Washington state.
The ultimate goal is to pro

Chemical warfare 
waged on ants
Scientists in California discov-. 
ered that by altering the chemi
cal coat on Argentine ants, they 
turn against each other. This 
is because Argentine ants, like 
most ants, rely upon chemical 
tags to determine whether an
other ant is of the same colony 
or not.
In recent history, the Argen
tine ant has been overpower
ing the native ant population in 
California. It is suspected that a 
boat from South America car
ried over the first colony of the 
Argentine ants. Today, one large 
supercolony spans from San Di
ego to San Francisco.
Scientists believe that the al
tering of the ants chemical coats 
could lead to a breakthrough in 
pest control.

Sea ice decreases
Studies released last Wednes
day show signs that arctic pe
rennial sea ice totals decreased 
by 14 percent between 2004 and 
2005. Arctic perennial sea ice 
stays frozen year-round.
Some researchers believe the 
results are a clear sign of global 
warming. Scientists have been 
monitoring the polar ice caps via 
satellite since the 1970s, but this 
occurrence is unique because it 
demonstrates a decline in the 
amount of ice during winter as

crew of road builders.
The block displays writings

nearly 3000 years. The block

Artificial gills now 
possible
Scientists studying the be
havior of beetles now believe 
they can find a way for humans 
to breathe underwater. Beetles 
can trap air to keep from drown
ing. Scientists believe that artifi
cial gills could mimic the same 
trick.
Most insects normally drown 
when submerged. The great div
ing beetie possesses rigid hairs 
on its underside that repel water 
to the point where they form a 
non-collapsible film of air. The 
film acts as gills, allowing air in 
the water to flow in and carbon 
dioxide in the air to diffuse out.
A likely use for this process is 
to enable some machines to op
erate in underwater situations.

New center onampus to promote
innovation in nanotechnology research
University officials hope that construction

NANO, from A6
to one-millionth of a meter. But 
in order to disassemble and rear
range the constituents that hold 
it together, one needs to probe at 
a scale 1000 times smaller.
A cluster of 100,000 nanopar
ticles would yield an accumula
tion smaller than the width of a 
human hair.
At first,, the idea of working 
on such an infinitesimal level 
might seem trivial. In reality, 
this is hardly the case. Manipu
lating atoms and molecules at a 
nanoscale level is essentially get

The idea is not a new one. 
Richard Feynman first proposed 
the idea of nanoscale atomic ma
nipulation in 1959. K. Eric Drexler coined the term nanotech
nology in 1986. Now science 
is starting to catch up with the 
dreams of science fiction.
The technology is being ap
plied more and more in the nano
medicine field. Cancer research, 
in particular, has benefited from 
nanotechnology.
Nanoparticles have the capa
bility to target specific cancer 
cells. When a patient under

treatment for cancer, millions of 
healthy cells are also destroyed.

steady rhythm. Working towards 
this goal, the audience members 
dont all follow the same person.
They listen for two things: the 
time period between claps (the 
frequency) and what they need 
to do. Certain audience members 
have to accelerate their clapping, 
while others have to slow down.
An audience synchronizing 
itself is an example of stochas
tic synchrony. Urbans work 
resembles the example with 
gamma neurons, which conduct 
slow motor impulses, in place of 
people.
Like the members of an audi
ence, neurons can become syn
chronized in two ways. Directly 
connected neurons can collec
tively respond to a particular 
signal, the same way an audi
ence would react to a pacemaker. 
This kind of activity is said to be 
connectivity-induced.
Stochastic synchrony  is a 
noise-induced reaction, one that 
is caused by many random inputs, 
such as an entire audience ini
tially clapping arythmically. By 
increasing the amount of noise, 
you can increase the amount of 
structure, Urban said.
Urban and Ermentrout studied 
stochastic synchrony both exper
imentally and computationally. 
Working in one of the Mellon In
stitutes three neuroscience labs, 
Urban was primarily involved in 
experimental research.
Using mice, he studied the ol
factory bulb, a part of the brain 
responsible for processing odors. 
A mouse has to be able to recog
nize tens of thousands of smells:
those of food, predators, and 
prey. Portions of the olfactory 
bulb will work in sync to commu
nicate information about a single 
odor to the brain.
Ermentrout works on the com
putational side of things. In place 
of neurons, Ermentrout uses sim
plified equations.
By modifying the equations, 
he can determine the essential 
factors of stochastic synchrony. 
This is helpful in determining 
which other systems in the brain 
might also function through the

use of noise-induced synchroni
zation.
Thats the objective of Urbans 
work: Hes trying to establish 
a causal relationship between 
problems with neuronal syn
chronization and disorders of the 
brain, including schizophrenia.
Gamma neurons, which have 
high frequencies, are thought to 
send messages to the brain via 
stochastic synchrony. These are 
the same neurons involved in 
processes like perception, con
sciousness, and memory.
This sort of synchronization
is disrupted in certain patient 
populations, said Urban.
It has-been suggested that this 
kind of disruption could be the 
root of schizophrenia. Current 
treatments for schizophrenia are 
not related to its cause, only its 
symptoms, which include delu
sions and hallucinations, as well 
as many of the problems associ'ated with depression, such as 
low energy.
Trying to find the exact causes 
of the illness is where things are 
really headed at this point, said 
Kevin Eklund, a clinical special
ist at the Western Psychiatric 
Institute & Clinic, part of the 
University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center.
Finding the cause of schizo
phrenia could lead to advance
ments in treatment. Medication 
and psychotherapy are the most 
common methods of treatment. 
Figuring out more about how the 
disease starts could be consid
ered a breakthrough.
Neuroscience is a significant 
area of study at both Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh. Because Carnegie 
Mellon lacks a medical school, 
the most effective kind of re
search for its professors and 
students is acutely focused. This 
kind of thinking has allowed sci
entists such as Urban to delve 
deeply into cognitive neurosci
ence.'
The University of Pittsburgh is 
a useful neighbor because Carn
egie Mellon researchers can take 
advantage of its medical school 
for broader study. Theres a re-, 
ally good synthesis between the 
two universities, said Urban.

population. Urban has been performing research at Carnegie Mellon since 2002.

18 September 2,006THE TARTANAio
f I  i    gTheEditorialBoard
David Kjos/Assistant Art Editor
We can do more with our talents
Last week, The Tartan questioned 
whether or not Carnegie Mellons focus 
on community service was adequate. 
(University President Jared Cohon took 
the time to weigh in on this question; 
please see his op-ed on the following 
page.) From a student perspective, 
though, we feel that the options for com
munity service are not always readily 
apparent on this campus.
Here are some suggestions for stu
dents, staff, and faulty to make our con
tributions bigger and better.
Seek out existing resources
Carnegie Mellon does have a com
munity service office, although it hasnt 
become common knowledge. Its in the 
Student Development Office, and the 
point of contact is M. Sherenell Smith. 
This office can provide students with a 
number of local service projects to get in
volved with, as well as larger efforts such 
as post-Hurricane Katrina relief. There is 
also a service intern, who sends out regu
lar e-mails to the campus community de
tailing upcoming projects. Inquire with 
Student Development to start receiving 
these e-mails.
Increase funding
Last semester, Student Senate allo
cated less than 2 percent of its budget 
to community service organizations. We 
say thats just not enough. In order for 
student service organizations to gain 
popularity and publicity, they need more 
funding and more recognition.
Take a cue from the Greeks
The Carnegie Mellon Greek commu
nity contributes through service on a 
regular and rigorous basis  we even 
have an entire co-ed fraternity devoted to 
service, Alpha Phi Omega. Other student 
organizations would do well to emu
late Greek life in this respect, and make 
service a regular part of their organi
zational structure. Not only do service 
projects give back to the community, 
but they create strong relationships and 
boost organizational morale. We also 
urge the Greek community to share their 
experiences and advice with the student 
community at large.
Incorporate community outreach into 
the classrooms
Every department has some service 
initiatives, whether theyre local (such 
as Take Back the Hill, a student-made 
journal in the Hill District) or interna
tional (such as Technology Consulting 
in the Global Community, which sends
students to developing countries over 
the summer to consult in building a 
technological infrastructure). There are 
plenty of classes that could incorporate 
community outreach into their curricula, 
and by exposing students to service, they 
could create an atmosphere focused not 
only on learning but on applying that 
learning to good works.
Make it a campus-wide movement
While service may be encouraged in 
Small circles, the only time it gets campus-wide recognition is during first-year 
Orientation, when a service day is in
cluded in the schedule of events. Why 
not make service an imperative across 
campus as a whole? Similar to A Day 
On on Martin Luther King Jr. Day,, the 
Student Development Office could create 
and publicize a Community Outreach 
Day5 over mid-semester break. Think of 
all the ways the local community could 
benefit if the entire student body were 
deployed, even for just one day.
During Orientation programs, the 
incoming class is constantly told how 
unique it is, how impressive, how exem
plary. Carnegie Mellon wastes no words 
in telling our student body that it has 
powerful gifts. Is it not, then, our respon
sibility as a student body to put those 
gifts to good use by giving back?
Many hands make light work
SDC is spreading itself too thin, must make recruitment a priority
Student Dormitory Council (SDC) 
films are off to a rocky start. (You might 
have noticed a lack of Saturday-night 
mowes in McConomy this semester.)
- SDC has had to cancel its films twice, 
depriving the student community of 
Steve Martin and madmen in Guy Fawkes 
masks. Yet the trouble with SDC is more 
serious than missing your favorite sum
mer blockbuster due to technical difficul
ties. The root of SDCs problem is recruit
ment  or lack thereof. Take it from The 
Tartan, which learned the hard way that 
recruitment should be done more heavily 
outside the organization. Waiting until 
its too late can be disastrous.
SDC has had a rough time recruiting 
members, which is a serious problem 
when you consider that SDC duties in
clude not only screening the Saturday 
McConomy films (often the most popu
lar films of the week), but also the alloca
tion of certain funds to campus housing 
activities. These funds help to reduce the 
price of tickets for Purnell shows and aid 
the RAs and CAs in taking members of
floors or houses out for events. In short, 
the Student Dormitory Council has an 
important role on this campus; if new 
members arent recruited, other groups 
may have to pick up the slack or students 
may have to do without SDCs vital (and 
fun) services.
SDC has asked AB Films for help and 
is trying to arrange for AB Films to train 
more people on the SDC executive board 
to operate the projection equipment. 
Thats a good step forward, but not one 
that will ultimately solve the problem of 
too few staff members. It might ensure 
that Saturday movies go off without a 
hitch, but it spreads a thin staff thinner.
Also, SDC should know what happens 
when students are torn between respon
sibilities: Its acting films chair is also an 
RA. Being the sole member of its film 
staff and an RA cannot be easy to bal
ance.
The solution SDC should be looking 
for is recruitment here and now, even 
if it feels it has missed the big surge at 
the years beginning. First-years on this
campus are more eager to engage in 
the community than ever. The year has 
barely begun, and even though training 
would have to be provided for new staff, 
it would prevent people from having to 
pull double duty.
Its great that SDC wants to train more 
of its staff to run films, but the situation 
wont get better unless it starts examin
ing why the organization has troubles 
with recruitment. Its a matter of taking 
the time and effort to look at the organi
zations practices and then finding those 
excited first-years (or upperclassmen) 
who want to be a part of making things 
happen for the student body.
SDC would be wise to start working to
ward a more viable solution rather than 
working its already overwrought staff 
harder. If not, the process of running 
a well-working organization will only 
become more challenging for the few 
members they have. Its a mistake that 
we at The Tartan have made in the past 
and hope to see SDC avoid. Many hands 
make light work.
Religion plays motivating 
role in the war on terror
Benjamin Hackett
Where does religion belong in the 
war on terror? Recently, Muslims have 
rioted, not over a cartoon this time, 
but over a speech by Pope Benedict 
XVI. The pontiff presented an aca
demic argument on the methodology 
of the spread of Islam  in which he 
entertains the possibility that vio
lence overtly pervades the ideological 
spread of militant Islam  and got a 
violent response in return: Palestin
ians attacked churches in Nablus, and 
run-of-the-mill American and Israeli 
flag burnings occurred around the 
Muslim world. Today, however, these 
points are not precursors for a theo
cratic comparison, rather a discussion 
of the question of whether God has 
any place in the war on terror.
Some denounce the pontiffs re
marks as a method of adding religion 
to the mix of concerns over the epic 
ideological struggle between Islamofascists and modern Western civiliza
tion. This is the same criticism often 
hurled at President Bush and some 
conservative leaders who dare to 
cast the enemy in a truthful light. 
These leaders dare to highlight the 
holy war of jihad that contemporary 
Islamofascists continue to undertake, 
all the while relying on their distorted 
interpretations of Islam.
Political correctness necessitates 
my admission of personal secularism 
in order to strengthen the following 
argument.
The discussion requires an examina
tion of the perception that the United
;ns the nature of removing all religion 
:rom public life. Yet, the issue here is not 
he longstanding attempt to remove all 
notions of God from the public realm, 
but rather a classic flaw in the reasoning 
Df the proponents of casting this struggle 
in a wholly secular light.
The counterargument here is not in 
favor of any sort of Judeo-Christian cru
sade on behalf of preserving Western 
ivilization. Rather, here we disagree 
with the idea that there are no valid re
ligious selling points to the war against 
he Islamofascists. The war itself can be 
iescribed in many truisms that should 
>erve as varying points of motivation for 
a population as varied as ours. This is not 
i manipulation of the public, but rather a 
rue explanation of an enemys intent, in 
erms that each group can relate to, and 
)e motivated by.
The concept of Godly religiosity and 
secular religiosity simplifies the issues 
hat matter to individual citizens. In this 
regard it is necessary, if not prudent, to 
relate the true threats of a mortal en
emy to the personal constitutions of the 
^erican public. As such, here are two 
hypothetical examples of completely 
parallel motivation techniques. Remem
ber, these hypothetical situations, while 
fictional, are based on the true actions of 
our current enemy.
First, President Bush grabs Larry Lib
eral and pulls him to the side. Larry 
Liberal is an agnostic who is primarily 
concerned with social issues, particu
larly gay rights and womens equality. 
President Bush explains to Larry Liberal 
that the Islamofascists kidnap, imprison, 
and kill gays in many countries. Bush 
then explains to Larry Liberal that the 
Islamofascists plan on reducing women 
to subservient creatures; creatures that 
require a mans permission to even leave
In a conflict with coniequences as dire as 
the ones the free word currently faces, 
there is no time to bepolitically correct. 
This means, when thee is a real threat, 
you describe it in rea terms.
States is increasingly trying to cast 
the battle with the Islamofascists as a 
struggle between the Judeo-Christian 
complex and the Islamic ward. The 
general argument above is that it is 
dangerous to cast this war in any re
ligious light whatsoever. The logic be
hind this argument is that this would 
make us similar to our enemy, to the 
point of losing the moral high ground. 
Criticism of adding any religious rea
soning to the struggle belies the intent 
behind the invocation of religious te
nets and realities.
The criticism continues by arguing 
that we should focus only on the Islamofascist hatred of democracy and 
certain Western societal tendencies. 
In the mentality of those who argue 
against any religious talk concern
ing this struggle, echoes can be heard 
of removing God from the pledge, or 
banning any religious artifact or rep
resentation anywhere near public 
groups. This is another case of classic 
disproportionate action, taken out of 
fear and completely devoid of reason.
In a conflict with consequences as 
dire as the ones the free world cur
rently faces, there is no time to be 
politically correct. This means, when 
there is a real threat, you describe it 
in real terms. Unfortunately for those 
that think the religion of secularism is 
the only acceptable form of worship, 
casting the threats of the enemy in eas
ily digestible terms  some of which 
have religious undertones  threathe house. These facts enrage Larry Libral, and motivate Larry to realize the 
lature of his enemy and participate in 
he fight against them.
Next, President Bush grabs Chester 
onservative and pulls him to the side. 
Chester Conservative is a devoutly reli
gious regular churchgoer who represents 
he more religious wing of his particular 
>olitical party. President Bush explains 
o Chester Conservative that the Islamoascists plan a worldwide theocratic 
ivilization in which all persons are of 
he Muslim faith. Bush then explains to 
Chester Conservative that the Islamofasrists will not tolerate religious diversity, 
rilling those who do not convert. These 
racts enrage Chester Conservative, and 
motivate Chester to realize the nature 
of his enemy and participate in the fight 
against them.
This is the same thing. You explain the 
threats to people in ways that coincide 
with their strongest beliefs. In this strug
gle, the things at stake are widespread 
and include political, religious, and socital tenets that we all hold dear. Perhaps 
he underlying issue preventing a clearer 
xplanation of the threat is fear. In any 
ase where the truth causes one to realze that his or her life  or constitution 
 is actually threatened by some enemy, 
hat person is forced to act. Failure to 
act in such a case is to actively engage in 
mes own demise.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 18, 2006Ail
Our young new mayor reflects a maturing Pittsburgh
The death of Bob OConnor, 
one of the citys most influential 
and energetic leaders, is certainly 
a tragedy, but the -installation 
of 26-year-old Luke Ravenstahl 
as mayor has the potential to 
be a great windfall for the city. 
As the new face of Pittsburgh, 
Ravenstahl is excited about us
ing his youth to change peoples 
minds about the city. But how 
will he use his position to actually 
change Pittsburgh?
Though Ravenstahl has not 
made many policy decisions yet, 
a reccurring theme in interviews 
has been a commitment to mak
ing the city more attractive to 
young job seekers. He told The 
New York Times: Pittsburgh has 
50,000 college students, and our 
challenge is to figure out how 
to retain them and to increase 
downtown development.
The young mayor, though his 
plans are not concrete, has sug
gested increasing opportunities 
for internships as a method of 
retaining college grads. Growing 
the number and scope of intern
ship opportunities is a fine goal, 
but internships are by their na
ture short-lived; they are step
ping stones to other places. He 
shouldnt just increase the intern
ship market or the job market, 
but increase the career market. 
Doing so requires a dynamic un
derstanding of Pittsburghs un
tapped resources. Pittsburgh is a 
place rich with innovative ideas 
and entrepreneurial spirit. How

I am a faithful reader of The Tartan ind 
one of its biggest boosters. The peer's 
phoenix-like rise from the ashes of th Natrat disaster of two years ago has bee in
spiring. I salute the students who ha^ led 
the effort, producing a fine campus i wspaper of which we can be proud.
But even the new Tartan can get t ngs 
wrong, as it did in the editorial He do 
we really rank? in its 11 September 0C6 
edition. The editors cited a flawed \iskington Monthly college ranking. Ar, n 
basing sweeping conclusions about inegie Mellon on that ranking, the e to s 
came to seriously incorrect conch ioiis 
about our University.
The editors were right to ask whthcr 
Carnegie Mellon encourage [s] coi mu
ni ty service and civic duty; wheth* ve 
go out of [our] way to offer opportu tits 
to those who cant afford the cost of ;teidance; and how many of our alum: aie

end poverty. But the editors were v org 
to base their answers to these questios cn

was based on a strange methodolcy.I 
didnt make an educated guess aboi tie 
methodology; with the help of our in it - 
tional research staff, I went to the traibe 
of finding, out.
The Washington Monthly rankings a; 
based on three equally weighted cat gries: community service, research, ni 
social mobility. Each of those is base a 
two or three factors. Let me briefly dis us 
each in turn.
Community service is based on t re 
factors: percentage of students enroll i a

Pittsburghs budding industries. 
He should even work to open up 
new industries and opportunities 
so that the budding humanists, 
artists, and social scientists dont 
feel like they must flee after their 
four years are up. And he does 
not have to limit his target audi
ence to that one figure  50,000 
graduates. Thousands of gradu
ates who grew up in Pittsburgh 
could be attracted back with solid 
career opportunities as well.
Hopefully his campaign to re
tain graduates will also focus 
on the fact that Pittsburgh is a 
great place to live. In 2005, The 
Economist ranked Pittsburgh as
one of the most livable cities in 
America. Based on culture, cli
mate, crime rates, cost of living, 
and health care, the ranking says 
a lot about the city. There is no 
reason that our relatively safe 
city with a low cost of living, re
spected cultural institutions, and 
a decent (if unpredictable) cli
mate should not be able to attract 
college graduates  unless, of 
course, there is nothing for them 
to do in that city because there 
arent anyjobs.
The framework is in place  
many businesses in various fields 
have found Pittsburgh a great 
place to settle. But we need more.

If the new mayor is committed to 
stemming the brain drain and 
helping Pittsburgh grow, then 
he needs also to be committed 
to opening up new industries 
and creating new opportunities 
so that a greater percentage of 
graduates feel like they can make 
a future here. We have a unique 
opportunity for change. There is 
no one better to project the image 
of youthful vitality in a city than a 
young and determined leader.

with ROTC, the Peace Corps, or federal 
work-study grants. For instance, the Wash
ington Monthly metrics completely ignore 
our students tutoring and mentoring of 
K-12 students, the thousands of hours of 
free support students provide to local non
profits and businesses through capstone 
project courses and independent research 
initiatives, the contributions of our Greek 
life system to local charities, food drives, 
blood drives, and Hurricane Katrina relief 
support efforts, and much, much more. 
Furthermore, no weight is given to alumni 
working for organizations like Teach for 
America or for those in public service.
By the way, our alumni are working to 
reverse global warming and end poverty. 
Prodipto Ghosh, for example, who re
ceived a Ph.D. from the Heinz School, is
region of Mississippi. Theres a long list of 
alumni who have devoted their careers to 
making the world a better place.
Research is also based on only three fac
tors: federal research grants, number of 
Ph.D.s awarded in science and engineer
ing, and percentage of undergrads who 
go on to receive a.Ph.D. (in any subject). 
I suppose those measures are not unrea
sonable, but not normalizing them (e.g., 
research dollars or Ph.D. awarded per fac
ulty) is very misleading. It leads to the con
clusion that bigger is not only better, size is 
basically the only thing that matters. A rel
atively small university like Carnegie Mel
lon will always fare poorly on such a list, 
despite being one of the most research
intensive institutions in the country.
Social mobility is based on percentage
of students receiving Pell Grants and the 
difference between a universitys actual 
graduation rate and its predicted gradu
ation rate, the latter computed with a 
formula created by Washington Monthly. 
The first measure does partially capture 
the relative size of the student popula
tion that qualifies for that form of fed
eral support but it misses completely the 
other forms of financial aid that universi
ties give. The second measure is bizarre: 
Washington Monthly uses the number of 
Pell grant recipients and the schools aver
age SAT scores to build a regression model 
to predict a schools expected graduation 
rate. The predicted graduation rate is then 
compared to the schools actual gradua
tion rate and ranked accordingly. Schools 
that outperform their expected gradua
tion rate are scored higher than schools 
that fell under their predicted graduation 
rates. Im not sure what theyre trying to 
measure with this, but no educator I know 
could support a regression model to pre
dict graduation rate based on only these 
two variables.
Ive given more space to the Washington 
Monthly ranking than it deserves. Indeed, 
if that ranking proves anything, its that any 
publication  even a marginal local maga
zine with a tiny circulation  can create 
rankings and get attention for them.
The real point is that Carnegie Mellon 
does encourage community service. We 
go out of our way to provid opportunity 
to those who cant afford our tuition. And 
Carnegie Mellon alumni (and faculty) are 
absolutely engaged in taking on societys 
greatest challenges.

Ideas to better 
organizations 
on campus
Karl Sjogren
Were at a school where stu
dent organizations do incredible 
things. We salute every student 
who has been involved in bring
ing about some of the terrific 
events that take place on our 
campus each year. Andrea and I 
believe we all want the same suc
cess for our organizations.
Yet Andrea, Kirk, and I rec
ognize that sometimes, some 
organizations fall through the 
cracks. Fiscal mismanagement, 
ineffective leadership, and poor 
member retention are direct 
results of environments where 
expectations for student organi
zations and student leaders are 
not immediately clear.
We need minimum standards 
that do not change from one orga
nization to another. Financial 
accountability and strong leader
ship are valuable to all organiza
tions. We want an environment 
where students may easily and 
effectively enter student organi
zations. For this to happen, we 
need to help organizations reach 
their full potential.
Were advocating two new 
initatives: modifications of the 
existing Committee on Student 
Organizations (CoSO) and the 
creation of a new Financial 
Advisory Board.
Working with the current CoSO 
chair, Franklin Williams, wed like 
to devise a system that helps stu
dent organizations understand 
what is expected from them. 
From a well-constructed consti
tution to an updated OrgTracker 
entry, this system would identify 
areas of excellence while noting 
areas that need improvement.
With this knowledge, CoSO, 
student government, and Student 
.Activities would be able to help 
student groups improve because 
we would know exactly what 
expectations are not being met.
Serving under the VP of 
Finance, the Financial Advisory 
Board would regularly review the 
finances of student organizations 
to ensure that their spending is 
in line with the JFC budget. The 
board would work with student 
leaders to provide advice on how 
to more effectively monitor and 
track spending. The board would 
help foster more financially savvy 
organizations by educating trea
surers and presidents about all 
potential funding sources.
The Financial Advisory Board 
would help student leaders, stu
dent organizations, and student 
government by creating an envi
ronment where budgets are more 
honest, accounting is more stan
dardized, and the student activi
ties fee is optimally distributed.
By defining expectations and 
helping organizations meet mini
mum standards, we can make it 
possible for all students to take 
ownership of this University.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 18, 2006
Football remains undefeated
Jiaqi Tan/Photo Staff
Junior running back Robert Gimson is taken down by a Westminster player. Gimson had 13 carries and 111 
yards to help the Tartan offense.
FOOTBALL, from A14
the first half.
Everything starts up front, 
said Mulkern, who, in addition 
to rushing for 25 yards and a 
touchdown on five carries com
pleted seven of 11 passes for 130 
yards. Those guys have done a 
great job of pass protecting all 
year and it has really opened up 
our passing game.
The Tartansopened up the 
second half by forcing a West
minster punt, paving the way 
for another Tartan scoring drive. 
Mulkern added a third touch
down when the senior ran un
touched into the end zone to cap 
a 13-play, 81-yard drive that ate 
6:20 off the clock.
The fourth quarter saw the 
possibility of a Tartan shutout 
end when Westminster scored 
a rushing touchdown to narrow 
the lead to 33-6, but it proved to 
be one of only a few blemishes on 
the day.
The Tartans ran out the final 
five-plus minutes of the fourth
quarter to secure their third 
straight victory.
What I told the kids was, 
it has been a good while since 
weve been 3-0, head coach 
Rich Lackner said. Its good 
to be 3-0. The kids are playing 
their hearts out right now, an)d 
theyre giving us great effort 
both in practice and on the field 
on Saturday afternoons. Im very 
pleased with the effort and the 
focus of this football team.
Although the passing game 
produced two touchdowns and 
over 100 yards of offense, Carn
egie Mellon racked up impres
sive numbers on the ground. 
Junior running back Robert 
Gimson carried the ball 13 times 
for 111 yards as the offensive 
line produced over 300 yards on 
the ground for a second straight 
week.
Its exciting, not only to have 
300 yards rushing but to have 
a passing attack, said senior 
guard J.R White. I think we 
have much more of a balanced 
attack. We knew going in against
Grove City [last week] that we 
would have to throw the ball 
more, and I think we just fol
lowed that scheme into this week 
and everybodys happy with the 
results.
The defense produced equally 
impressive results. In addition to 
posting two scores of their own, 
they held Westminster to 180 
yards of total offense, forcing six 
punts and two turnovers.
I think the defense has taken 
on the personality of the captains 
and the seniors on that side of 
the ball, Lackner added. I think 
that Aaron Lewis and Jaime Ploetzner and [James Rogers] ... set 
the tone for this football season 
in camp. I think they set the tone 
at practice; I think they set the 
tone during the games.
The Carnegie Mellon football 
team will look to add to its streak 
next week with a second consec
utive home date. Franklin and

putting their 1-1 record on the 
line against the Tartans.

Going down one goal, the 
mindset for us is dont panic; 
lets pick up the tempo; lets just 
get the one goal back; lets get it 
back to even ground. We dont 
need to think about winning or 
losing; we need to think about 
the next step, which is scoring 
that first goal, said assistant 
coach Rob Czlonka.
And to be honest with you, 
Im really excited. We havent 
given up a goal this year, and 
Id liked to have kept that, but 
knowing that we went down one 
goal and we were able to come 
back and score three, thats a 
very positive thing. It makes 
me more confident in our team, 
that when faced with some stiff 
competition and we go down a 
goal, well still be able to come 
back from that, he said.
The mens soccer team be
gins a four-game road trip this 
week and will not play at home 
in Gesling Stadium until Octo
ber. We just need to keep get
ting victories, sort some things 
out, and I think well be okay 
once UAA [University Athletic 
Association] play starts, said 
Filipovitz.
The Tartans will open their 
road trip by traveling to play 
Penn State-Altoona on Tuesday 
at 7 p.m.

week, said sophomore mid
fielder Laura Steidel. So it was 
really good to put a corner kick 
in because we have been work
ing on them every practice.
Stever scored her second goal 
and the final goal of the game in 
the 88th minute when she cor
ralled a loose ball for an emptynet goal.
First-year forward Saman
tha Simmons brought the ball 
into the left-side of the box and 
scrambled with Russo until the 
ball bounced over to Stever, who 
turned and put the ball into the 
net.
Sam came on  she doesnt 
get many minutes, but she made 
the most of her minutes. She did 
some great work in there, said 
head coach Sue Willard.
The Tartans dominated
throughout the game, 
out-shooting the Eagles 14 to 
one. Adams picked up one save. 
[Adams] is starting to make 
better decisions, Willard said. 
She is working on her weak
nesses and she is doing a really 
good job thus far.
Since two of the teams 
starting forwards graduated last 
year, this season has been about 
trying to fill holes throughout 
positions. Losing forwards 
was a big thing, said Steidel, 
but the people who stepped up

really took it upon themselves to 
learn.
Everyone has really good 
attitudes, Stever added. If 
[Willard] moves positions 
around, nobody really questions 
it, or bats an eye.
The Tartans begin a fourgame road trip today when they 
play Washington & Jefferson at
5 p.m. Washington & Jefferson 
are the same type of opponent 
we played [Saturday], both good 
building blocks, said Willard.

following game. The Tartans

lead momentarily, leading 10-9, 
but were unable to maintain the
momentum and lost the game to. i
the Bearcats 15-12, losing the 
match 2-3.
Despite the disappointing loss, 
assistant coach Laura Graf re
mained optimistic. They played 
very well, said Graf. The teams 
were very evenly matched. We 
still have a lot of work to do, but 
it was okay.
Senior right side Catie Fisher 
led the offense with 20 kills. 
Senior outside hitter Amanda 
Bradford, senior middle hitter 
Malena Yablinsky, and Toney 
each managed to finish the game 
with kills in the double digits. 
Senior setter Brea Carlock and 
first-year setter Samantha Carter 
contributed 39 and 18 assists, re
spectively. Fox led the game de
fensively with 25 digs. Yablinsky 
and Metier each had four blocks.
Coming off four straight 
losses, the Tartans have work to 
do the next couple weeks. [We]
just started the season and still 
have a lot of stuff to work on, 
said head coach Kimberly Kelly.
Weve had a lot of problems 
with little things, a kill here, or 
a pass there ... so that is what we 
really have to work on, Fisher 
said. [The team] will be really 
working on communication and 
still working at getting used to 
trusting each other on plays.
On Wednesday the team 
travels to the University of 
Pittsburgh-Greensburg. On Fri

the Carnegie Mellon Crossover

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Reggie Bush placed under investigation
Doug Fricker
The University of Southern 
Californias (USCs) former 
Heisman Trophy winner Reg
gie Bush is in the news again, 
and its not because of his suc
cessful NFL debut this past 
week with the New Orleans 
Saints.
According to a report posted 
on Yahoo! Sports last Thurs
day, Bush and his family 
received more than $100,000 
in benefits from marketing 
agents while Bush was playing 
at USC, which is a violation of 
the NCAAs bylaws.
This sticky situation is a lot 
like steroids in baseball. As
suming that Bush did break 
the rules, how do you fix and 
rectify something thats in the 
past and already happened? I 
believe the guilty parties in
volved should be punished, but 
the NCAA system is flawed and 
you cant go back and rewrite 
history.
An extreme stance to take 
would be to strip USC of ev
erything theyve accomplished 
over the past two seasons dur
ing which these alleged ben
efits were occurring.
Of course, that would mean 
forfeiting USCs victories, 
returning Bushs 2005 Heis
man Trophy, and voiding the 
schools 2004 national champi
onship title.
Critics say this is naturally 
never going to happen because 
the NCAA would be saying to 
everyone that the season that 
just occurred was a fraud if it 
did so. How would the public
react, knowing that the entire 
season they just witnessed was 
fake?
Taking away national cham
pionships has been done in 
other sports, most recently to 
the 2002 Hawaii mens volley
ball team for using ineligible 
players.
Its just a hunch, but Im 
willing to bet that football at 
USC gained more revenue for 
the university than mens vol
leyball did at Hawaii. Im not 
saying that players like Bush 
should be allowed to receive il
legal benefits, but I am saying 
that they are generating more 
revenue for their university 
than a mens volleyball player 
or a regular student.
The argument to back this 
is that theyre on scholar
ship, so its a fair deal  you 
go to school free and get to 
play football. This works fine 
for some players, but then for 
some superstars like Bush you 
run into the problem of them 
being under-compensated for 
everything they contribute to 
the school.
In college football this is 
magnified because players 
must stay a minimum of three 
years at a university before de
claring for the NFL. They are 
forced to stay in college and 
get an education when getting 
the education might not be the 
reason they are there. I doubt 
Maurice Clarett spent his time 
writing computer code or inte
grating complex functions.
Saying that theyll need their 
college education when their 
playing days are over is pos
sibly true, but it doesnt justify
the NCAA profiting off these 
athletes; you dont know how 
much value some of these play
ers get out of their education. If 
your dream is making it to the 
NFL, you are going to do what
ever is in your power to achieve 
that dream, which means mak
ing that a higher priority than 
your education.
Returning back to Bush, I 
disagree with punishing USC 
and tarnishing everything col
lege athletics is based on. If 
Bush did accept benefits from 
agents or marketing represen
tatives, he would have violated 
the NCAAs bylaws, and actions 
should be taken against him 
and against the agents at fault. 
The required action is for Bush 
to be deemed ineligible, but 
that doesnt fit the current situ
ation.
Declaring him ineligible 
would set off a chain of events 
and not fix anything; instead, it 
would create more problems.
Bushs teammates at USC 
would be stripped of a national 
championship because of some
thing he did and that they had 
nothing to do with. Bush, his 
family, and more importantly 
the agents, if at fault, should 
have to pay the price, whatever 
that may be, but thqse benefits 
did not transform him into ar
guably the best running back 
in recent history and it didnt 
give the national champion
ship to USC.
Lets not be naive either in 
thinking that Reggie Bush is 
the only college athlete to al
legedly receive illegal benefits. 
Punish the parties at fault, but 
dont start changing the past.
Mens cross country wins invite
by Sam Kim
Junior Staffwriter
Last Saturday the mens and 
womens cross country teams 
traveled to Waynesburg to 
compete at the Waynesburg In
vitational.
The mens team took home a 
first-place finish out of 15 teams, 
dominating the competition 
with 40 points, 14 points better 
than the second-place Allegheny 
College.
The womens team finished 
with 240 points, which was good 
enough for a lOth-place tie with 
Geneva College out of a field of 
14 teams. Dickinson College won 
the womens race with 44 points.
The weather was foggy and 
cool, which made for good run
ning conditions. The largely flat 
course will be the site of the 2006 
NCAA Mideast Regional title. 
Carnegie Mellon used Saturdays 
race to get used to the grassy 
course before the championship 
meet, which will take place in 
November.
Mens cross country
Sophomore Brian Harvey led 
the Tartans to victory, finishing 
the 8K race second overall with 
a time of 26:14.71.
Finishing behind Harvey was 
first-year Dario Donatelli, who 
made his collegiate debut run
ning a time of 26:22.32  good 
enough for third place overall. 
Donatelli is the son of cross coun
try head coach Dario Donatelli. 
Coach Donatelli graduated from
Carnegie Mellon in 1981 and 
was a tremendous runner dur
ing his college years. He received 
All-American honors and led the 
Tartans to the NCAA Mideast Re
gional title.
Dario had a great perfor
mance for his first collegiate 
race, said senior captain Geoff 
Misek. We knew he would be 
one of the top freshmen, but I 
dont know if anyone expected 
him to race quite as well as he 
did. It was just a great race for 
him.
Finishing third for the Tar
tans was sophomore Brett Fresen, who finished eighth overall 
with a time of 26:50.42. Misek 
and sophomore Andrew Frederickson followed with times of 
27:08.80 and 27:12.21, respec
tively. Misek and Frederickson 
finished 13th and 14th overall.
Sophomore Ryan Anderson 
finished 16th overall with a time 
of 27:17.53, and first-year Sean 
Hamilton came in 25th place 
with a time of 27:35.37.
On Saturday the mens team 
will split up, with some of the 
team traveling to Penn State and 
the rest of the team traveling at 
St. Vincent.
Womens cross country
Over the 6K course, the duo 
of sophomore Carolyn Clayton 
and first-year Danielle Sedlack 
led the Tartans. Clayton finished 
first for the team with a time of 
24:41.2, placing 22nd overall. 
Sedlack followed Clayton to fin
ish second for the Tartans.

ally well together, and we really 
pushed each other all the way to 
the end, Clayton said.
I personally was pleased with 
my own performance since I had 
never ran longer than a 5K in 
high school, Sedlack said.
Behind Clayton and Sedlack, 
senior Jerri Castillo ran a time of 
25:53.8 and finished third for the 
team. Junior Carrie Kmetzo and 
sophomore Chrissy Krutz fol
lowed with times of 26:05.9 and 
26:08.05, respectively. Senior 
captain Stefani Penn finished 
sixth on the team with a time of 
26:26.4. First-year Anna Lenhart 
rounded out the Tartans top 
seven with a time of 26:37.8.
The womens team will join 
some of the mens team in St. 
Vincent on Saturday for a race 
scheduled at 10:30 a.m.

ended the game by halftime.
Immediately following the 
turnover on downs, on the second 
play of the second quarter, se
nior linebacker Jaime Ploetzner 
wrapped up Westminster run
ning back Nick McKolosky in the 
end zone for a safety.
Senior quarterback Kevin 
Mulkern gave the Tartans their 
first touchdown of the afternoon 
when he rolled out of the pocket 
and hit senior wide receiver Jon
athon Kline for a 13-yard touch
down. The five-play, 41-yard 
scoring drive pushed the Tartans 
lead to 9-0.
Less than a minute later, Carn
egie Mellon lit up the scoreboard 
with another big play. Senior de
fensive back Aaron Lewis picked 
off a Westminster pass and re
turned the interception 20 yards 
for six more points. Lewis 11th 
career interception and first ca
reer touchdown extended the 
Tartans advantage to 16-0.
The defense we were in al
lowed me to cheat a little and 
break on the ball, said Lewis, 
who also recorded a pass break
up and six tackles. The ball was 
thrown low and it kind of popped 
up a little bit and it wasnt that 
far to run, so I got in there before 
they could catch up to me. But 
we were in the perfect situation; 
it was well-covered and one of 
those opportunities where if it 
pops up you gotta make a play.
On the next two series, the 
defense limited Westminster 
to a three-and-out and forced a 
fumble to give the ball back to
the offense. Senior kicker Nat 
Greenstein added a 36-yard field 
goal to increase the Tartans lead 
to 19 points with 3:47 remaining 
in the second quarter.
A third three-and-out by 
the Carnegie Mellon defense 
returned the ball to the offense 
with just under two minutes 
remaining in the half. Three 
rushes and a 27-yard completion 
later, Mulkern dropped back on 
third-and-five and found Derek 
Wisnieski crossing the middle 
of the field. The sophomore tight 
end strolled into the end zone for 
a 24-yard touchdown pass. The 
score capped a 26-point second 
quarter for the Tartan's, who held 
the ball for over 18 minutes in

This week it took them almost 
a quarter, but once the Tartans 
got rolling they put together 
their third-straight dominant 
performance to move to 3-0 on 
the season.
In their home opener, the 
Carnegie Mellon football team 
deployed their powerful run

defeat the Westminster Titans

The Tartans beat Grove City 
2-0 on the road Tuesday and 
followed that up with a 3-1 win 
over Juniata Saturday night at 
Gesling Stadium. The team is 
now ranked ninth in the www.

Ryan Browne changed that when 
he placed a direct free kick from

The Tartan womens volley
ball team took on St. Vincent 
College last Thursday evening at 
Skibo Gymnasium, losing to the 
Bearcats 3-2. The loss brought 
the Tartans season record to 3-7 
while improving St. Vincents re
cord to 8-3.
Getting off to a rocky start, 
Carnegie Mellon lost their first 
set to the Bearcats 30-20. The 
Tartans managed to turn the 
game around in the second set to 
come back and win 30-20.
The third set was close, with 
the lead transferring back and 
forth between Carnegie Mel
lon and St. Vincent, bringing 
Tartan fans to their feet cheer
ing for most of the set. During 
the game, senior libero Kat Fox 
fueled the win by serving three 
consecutive aces, and key block
assists by senior middle hitter 
Becky Metier and by junior out
side hitter Abbie Toney allowed 
the Tartans to overcome the 
Bearcats 32-30, giving the Tar
tans a 2-1 lead heading into the 
fourth game.
The fourth set was as closely 
matched as the third, with both 
teams fighting back and forth for 
every point. I thought the team 
did extremely well.... It was a 
very exciting, close game, said 
Athletic Director Susan Bassett. 
In the end, it was St. Vincent 
that pulled out the win (30-27), 
sending the match to a fifth set, a 
first for the Tartans this season.
During the fifth set, the 
Bearcats got off to a running 
start by scoring four unanswered 
points. The Tartans battled 
back, and Toney hit a kill that 
tied the score at 8-8. Later, the

After a frustrating 1-0 loss 
to Capital College on Tuesday, 
Carnegie Mellon womens soc
cer pulled out a 3-0 win over the 
Juniata Eagles Saturday night 
to bring their season record to
2-2-1.
On Tuesday night, Carnegie 
Mellon hosted the Capital 
Crusaders in a rainy home 
opener. Capital forward Natasha 
Ballard scored the only goal of 
the game in the 72nd minute of 
play when she took a pass from 
midfielder Roucille Daza and 
found an opening on the right 
side of the net past Carnegie Mel
lon sophomore goalkeeper Chris
tie Adams. Adams had two saves 
in the game.
Although the Tartans out-shot 
the Crusaders 16-6, they were 
unable to finish and find the back 
of the net, a problem which has 
been plaguing the Tartans since 
the beginning of the season.
The Tartans used their practices 
during the rest of the week to 
address the problem before fac
ing Juniata on Saturday. Their 
practice paid off as they blasted 
three goals past the Eagles.
Junior forward Kasey Stever 
opened up Tartan scoring Sat
urday night when she received a 
pass from senior midfielder Lisa 
Pascoli and shot the ball past Ju
niata goalkeeper Lisa Russo. The. 
goal gave the Tartans a 1-0 lead 
in the 28th minute of play, which 
is where the score stayed head
ing into halftime.
In the second half, sophomore 
forward Abby Coffin increased 
the Tartan lead to two goals when 
she scored in the 53rd minute of 
play. Junior defender Amanda 
Rose took a corner kick from the 
left side and crossed the ball to 
the center, where Coffin scored 
off a header.

finishes all week. We have been

websites offer a wealth of 
information related to different 
industries. You need to know 
the who-what-when-wheres of 
the industry you're specifically 
interested in: Whos important 
in the field; what do they do? 
What companies have what 
kinds of influences in the 
industry? When did the biggest 
shifts in materials, methods, 
and people take place? Where 
do crucial companies in the 
field do business?
If you know your field, you can 
chat it up with the bigwigs  
then youre already ahead.
Know the position
Find out all you can about 
the position so you can make 
the most of the short time 
youll have with a recruiter. 
Look into what the position is 
like throughout the industry, 
and more specifically within 
the company. How do they 
compare? What is the pay like?
Know yourself
Be ready to talk in detail about 
your experiences related to the 
job you are aiming for. What 
classes have prepared you for 
this position? What previous 
job experiences have you had 
related to the field? What did 
you accomplish there? Can you

personality strengths?

4 THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 18, 2006
A quick & easy guide
TECHNICA^ OPPORTUNITIES CONFERENCE
With dozens upon dozens of 
company booths and hundreds 
of students waiting in line for 
their chance to make it big, 
the BOC and TOC can be 
overwhelming. Be ready.
Take a deep breath
The most important thing to 
remember is that this career 
fair is not a "life or death 
situation. In fact, the majority 
of people find jobs by means 
other than a career fair.
Especially if its your first time 
visiting a career fair, look at 
the event as a way to meet 
some interesting people and 
learn more about what sort of 
job you are interested in.
Know where to go
When you walk through the 
door, you'll find yourself in a 
mess of people, some milling 
uncomfortably about and 
others confidently moving from 
booth to booth. You should 
have a list of companies you 
want to visit and know where 
their booths are located  use 
the maps on pages B8-B9.
Avoid the long lines  wait 
until the queue dies down if
you can. Wait patiently for 
a free recruiter, then step 
forward and speak up.
Prepare your introduction
In one smooth sentence, you 
should explain who you are 
and why are you talking to the 
recruiter to whom youve just 
introduced yourself.
Keep in mind that in these 
initial seconds, the recruiter 
will formulate his or her opinion 
of you. Most people fumble 
through their introductions, so 
if you practice, you will stand 
out. If you really want to nail it, 
practice aloud with friends  a 
little weird, but worth a job.
Lose the white socks
Do you have clean black 
socks? Make sure you get your 
hands on all the items youll 
need the night before. Men: a 
dark suit, light-colored shirt, 
necktie, matching belt, shoes, 
and socks, and light cologne. 
Women: dark suit jacket 
and matching skirt or pants, 
closed-toe shoes, conservative 
makeup, and light perfume. 
Both: a professional hairstyle, 
well-manicured nails, and 
portfolio.

BEST PRINTING. BEST PRICE.
We are proud to he an equal opportunity employer.
1) Perfect your rsumi
Your r6sum6 is a single piece 
of paper that represents you 
every step of the way  for 
, better or for worse  so give it 
the attention it deserves.
The 15-second read
Your r6sum6 is one of as 
many as 500 resumes that a 
recruiting team from a top firm 
Ts likely to get this week. Each 
resume will get 15 seconds of 
attention before it lands in the 
yes pile or the "no pile, so 
i make every word count.
j Format for a quick scan
Creating a readable document 
will make it less painful for 
your recruiter if your resume is 
number 198 of the day.
; Break it up into sections: 
education, experience, 
activities, skills, and interests 
 use a line or two and show 
some personality. Your goal is 
to capture the short attention 
of the recruiter. Using these 
categories will help you 
cast a broad net, so they're 
most likely to identify with 
something on your resume.ijUse indentation, spacing, 
bold text, and bullet points
to organize the information 
on your page. But be careful; 
dont go overboard. If you have 
any doubt, ask your career 
counselor.
Begin to tell your story
Your resume should begin 
to tell a story about who you 
are. We say "begin, because 
you want to reveal enough to 
pique the readers interest but 
save enough of the interesting 
details for you to talk about.
Leave zero errors
Its that simple. Attention 
to detail is among the most 
common points in a job 
posting, so dont submit a 
resume that will disqualify you. 
Proofread twice. Get a friend 
to proofread. Get your career 
councelor to proofread.
Customize for the company
If you have a diverse set of 
interests, like many Carnegie 
Mellon students do, youll 
probably be meeting with 
recruiters from a variety of 
companies. Consider creating 
tailored resumes for various 
companies that highlight the 
most relevant aspects of your 
experience.
2) Do your homework
-----------------------------------------------------------------------\
3) Know what to expect
Careers that move at the speed of your ambition.
the company, thats even better. 
Use sites like hoovers.com 
(free on campus) or guidestar. 
org, which offer background 
on companies and non-profits, 
respectively.
Make sure to check out the 
company's website and find 
news about them. Also, seek 
out and talk to people who work 
or have worked for the company 
to get the inside perspective.
The career fair is not a time to 
learn about a company youre 
interested in. When you step up 
to the plate, you should already 
know a lot.
Know the industry
Its a rare industry that doesnt 
have reading material to 
accompany it. Read up on the 
industry youre interested in, 
so you can speak intelligently 
about it.

4) Act like a professional6) Follow up graciously
The easiest way to get 
recruiters to take you seriously 
and remember your name 
is by presenting yourself 
professionally. If you look 
sharp, act smart, and actively 
seeking out opportunities, 
youll leave a good impression 
and make an interview down 
the line that much easier.
Hold yourself with poise
Some communication experts 
assert that body language has 
the most significant effect on 
the impression you make when 
you meet someone. Stand 
tall, with equal weight on your 
feet. Avoid shifting your weight 
excessively. Use your hands 
calmly and naturally as you 
talk to keep them out of your 
pockets. You want to convey 
your confidence by standing 
and moving comfortably.
Hopefully youve already done 
some basic research, so dont 
waste time asking general 
questions like What does your 
company do?
Ask targeted questions
Ask about specific positions 
inside the company  this 
will show recruiters that youre 
serious enough about the job 
to have already investigated 
what they have to offer.
Try to ask focused questions 
about what its actually like to 
work for the company. Some
V_____________________
Make contact
Dont give recruiters a deadfish handshake. Nothing 
spells bad first impression 
like a limp, floppy greeting. A 
handshake can tell recruiters 
volumes about you  how 
confident you are, how excited 
you are to be talking to them, 
and how well you might blend 
with their corporate culture.
A firm handshake and direct 
eye contact will go a long way 
toward helping your case.
good starting points are what 
an average work week is like, 
what requirements prospective 
employees should have, what 
the company's approach to 
diversity is, and what the 
overall company atmosphere 
is like.
Asking good questions will help 
in two ways: First of all, youll 
learn about the companies 
youre interested in working 
for, and you will also impress 
recruiters with your initiative to 
learn. The information will be 
invaluable in your, interview.
Be positive
Dont spend time criticizing 
or disparaging your previous 
employment, either. You will 
probably be asked about your 
past work experience, and 
4 you don't want to answer with 
a long tirade about how your 
former boss had the IQ of a 
jar of mayonnaise. Its better 
to concentrate on what you 
learned from the experience or 
how it helped refine your long
term employment goals.
Listen and take notes
Use good eye contact, nod, 
and clarify points you dont 
understand to show you're 
listening actively.
Don't forget to jot notes down, 
too. An excellent way to keep 
things simple and organized is 
to collect a business card from 
each recruiter you talk to and 
write notes about the company, 
the job, and the recruiter on 
the back. That way, youll have 
a handy resource to look back 
on later  pre-catalogued and 
everything.
The best way to stay fresh in 
the minds of recruiters is by 
writing each of them a letter 
a few days after you talk to 
them. The letter doesnt have 
to be very fancy, just a brief 
note reminding them,who 
you are and where you met. 
Mention your conversations
The career fairs are great, 
but around three quarters 
of all jobs are won through 
networking. Your best bet is to 
start schmoozing early.
Getting into the network
Career services organizes 
frequent networking events 
that involve both corporate 
recruiters and Carnegie Mellon 
alumni from all fields.
Attend every networking 
event you can, because the 
ability to network comfortably 
and gracefully will make you 
stand out like nearly no other 
skill. Practice is the only 
way to learn. Youll find that 
even after you've gotten a 
job, networking is the most
to jog their memories. 
(Remember the notes you were 
taking?) Thank them, say you 
enjoyed the conversation, and 
ask to meet-again. This way, 
youve put your foot in the 
metaphorical door; complete 
the transaction by saying youll 
follow up by phone in a few
common way to score a 
promotion or another job.
Show up and dive in
Show up on time and dressed 
sharply, on par with other 
guests. Feel free to have 
something to drink and some 
easy-to-eat food. Stack your 
cup on your plate and hold a 
napkin under the plate. This 
way your right hand is free for 
a firm shake.
Work the room
Have a plan for who you want 
to talk to and get to it. Use 
the general introduction you 
practiced for the career fair 
to introduce yourself to new 
people. Ask polite questions 
and share of yourself. Keep
days. The phone call will give 
you a chance to solidify the 
meeting and make a second 
impression  and get a read 
on what the recruiters might 
think of you. Be confident 
and proactive in setting up 
the second meeting  it will 
probably be your best chance.
good eye contact; refrain from 
"shopping for other people 
to meet. Keep a time limit of 
five to 10 minutes, and politely 
leave with a preprepared 
exit line: There's a friend I 
need to speak with. It was a 
pleasure to meet you. Before 
you depart, trade business 
cards and, if youre interested, 
arrange a time on another day 
to continue the conversation.
Bringing it forward
At the end of the night, review 
the business cards you've 
collected and note the topic 
of your conversation and some 
important details about the 
contact to help you start up 
the conversation next time. 
These are called tickler files 
and are a hugely succesful tool 
used by countless business 
professionals in all industires.
Be sure to thank the host 
before you leave, so youll be 
invited to the next gathering.
To make an even better 
impression, send a formal 
thank-you note. A simple note 
will go a long way.
5) Ask real questions

B.Y.O.B. to the White House Did you know?
Mix drinks with art at alums White House Studios
A cluster of easels is set up in a circle around the 
model for the evening: a stuffed monkey peering 
out of a plastic watering can that rains over a 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. The lighting in the 
19th-century carriage house is warm, and there 
is a distinctly friendly and social atmosphere 
among the various artists gathered for Late Night 
Painting at The White House Studios in Shaler. 
Late Night Painting is B.Y.O.B., and about an 
hour into the evening the Yuengling and Corona 
bottles make their first appearance as the crowd 
gains two or three more members. Anne Lopez 
and Michael Killen, co-founders of The White 
House Studios and both Carnegie Mellon alumni, 
mill around the studio conversing easily with 
newcomers and veterans alike.
Lopez, class of '96, and Killen, class of 86, are 
both professional artists. Lopez is a visual artist 
dealing primarily in abstract art that has been 
commissioned both locally and internationally. 
Killen, who graduated with a degree in graphic 
design, works in downtown Pittsburgh directing 
regional and national commercials for a company 
called Animal. The two discovered the 128- 
year-old mansion completely by chance on a 
late-night drive around Pittsburgh. Immediately 
after touring the premises, they began forming 
the rough outlines of what would eventually 
become The White House Studios. In addition to 
Late Night Painting, the studio offers a variety 
of night classes for students and adults ranging 
from instruction on henna tattoos to creative 
writing classes and figure drawing. The White 
House Studios does not cater to any specific 
demographic, but instead embraces all ages and 
skill levels.
The most distinctive feature of The White 
House Studios is its rustic atmosphere. The 
building stands out as a very unique modern art 
space among other contemporary New Age or 
industrial warehouse studios. After Lopez and 
Killen bought the mansion and its accompanying 
carriage house on the first of this year, they spent 
six months renovating the squirrel- and raccooninfested building. They stripped the house down 
to its original wood paneling, returning the house 
to the historic authenticity that contributes to 
the current inspirational ambiance. "To paint 
over it, you paint over the history of it, all that 
might have happened here, said Lopez of the 
exposed walls. Lopez obtained all of the furniture 
and fixtures in the studio from Construction 
Junction, Goodwill, and even neighbors' 
trash. Despite this, the space looks incredibly 
cohesive and well-put together. The compelling 
atmosphere of The White House Studios lends 
itself easily to creativity.
Lopez and Killen passionately believe that 
creativity can enrich the lives of everyone. At 
The White House Studios, they envision a shift 
from the current passivity of social scenes like 
bars and movie theaters to a more actively 
creative setting. This concept, which Killen 
dubs "education as entertainment, is part of a 
larger future endeavor unofficially called "The
White House Project. Tentative project plans 
include expanding into publishing lifestyle and 
image books. Lopez and Killen expect to open 
the lower floor of the main house as a healthy 
vegetarian caf, shop, and gallery space as part 
of their overall plan to integrate creativity into 
socialization.
Though New York City and Los Angeles might 
seem like more viable living options for artists, 
both Lopez and Killen have found that great 
studio spaces are incredibly affordable in the 
Pittsburgh area. In Pittsburgh, they enjoy the 
amenities of living and creating in a big city 
without the price tag of larger metropolises.
The co-founders also insist that Pittsburgh is 
the city of the future because of the many 
opportunities available to those in the artistic 
and technological fields.
Morton Brown, one of the studios instructors, 
works with the Late Night Painting crowd. He 
is the mastermind behind the monkey/watering 
can/Ninja Turtle still-life model for the evening. 
However, Late Night Painting is primarily free 
form. Evan Ringle, a student at the University of 
Pittsburgh, is painting a winged bleeding heart 
on a small canvas next to his mother, who has 
the pale beginnings of a flower proportionate in 
size to one of OKeefes. Wednesdays Late Night 
Painting is not a class, though Brown is available 
for suggestions, assistance, and inspiration. It 
is a workshop, a peer review, a studio, and a 
hangout. It provides a time and place for people 
to get together and paint free of pretension and 
self-consciousness.
Though an iTunes playlist of Lopez and Killens 
creation is the default studio music, anyone is 
welcome to bring in a CD for the soundtrack 
to the evening. The open doors of the carriage 
house bring in the cool air from the rain outside, 
so Lopez brings in a tea tray for anyone who 
needs warming. Once the painters have 
reworked their pieces to the point of exhaustion 
for the evening and everyone has run out of 
free space on their palettes, the slow process of 
packing up begins. Paintings are left out to dry 
until next week, and beer bottles are tossed into 
the now-full trash can. Everyone says goodbye 
to Anne and Michael, with whom they are on a 
first-name basis, and is invited back to the Late 
Night Painting Party next Wednesday. You can 
bet they'll be there, probably with a friend, and 
definitely with a six-pack.
Late Night Painting at The White House 
Studios is every Wednesday night from 8 p.m. 
to midnight at 1540 Evergreen Road, Shaler. It 
is $10 to participate and $5 lor a painting kit 
rental. To take the bus to the studio, take the 61D 
inbound to Forbes and Market, and then take the 
IF outbound to Evergreen Road and Millvale Bus 
Loop. Class schedules are available at 
www. thewhitehousestudios. com.

For the incoming first-years, Orientation week had 
concluded. Rush week was over. The Activities 
Fair had taken place. All of the fun parties and 
events were bid adieu by the new CIT students. 
Then-editors of The Tartan Toni Powell and Sally 
Stern had simple words to offer the incoming 
class. They wrote: The work has begun, we wish 
our classmates and friends the best of luck and a 
glorious year at CFT. In other words, the editors 
were kindly warning the newbies about the fact 
that, unlike at state schools, the fun stuff doesnt 
continue. Thank goodness things have changed.
Carnegie Mellon hosted the first competition for 
a developing computer program called World 
Chess Champion. This marked the beginning 
of computer-versus-person gaming. The school 
established a $100,000 prize for whomever could 
create a computer program that would be able 
to take first place. Fabulous! Leave it to Carnegie 
Mellon to take our proud sense of computer 
gaming nerdiness to a whole new level.
Students were perturbed about continually getting 
accosted by corporate representatives soliciting 
their products on campus. The vendors, including 
those of major credit card companies, had been 
situating their tables in the busy area between 
Doherty Halland the Fence. Students found that 
the reps were a nuisance, especially as they 
were already rushed and struggling through that 
congested area on their way to class. Its fortunate 
that the school stopped allowing such solicitors to 
occupy that space  now on their way to class, 
students only have to pass through the myriad of 
organizations handing out fliers and recruiting to 
bolster their ranks.
University Police responded to a call about criminal 
mischief occurring in West Wing. A Carnegie Mellon 
staff member alerted the police to people attempting 
to yank a water fountain off the wall. Upon arrival, 
the police officer noted the damage. He detected 
a shallow pool of water that had dripped onto the 
floor beneath the fountain, causing him to take 
extreme measures to protect public safety. The 
officer promptly bordered off the area with his 
yellow barricade safety tape before making a call to 
CPS for reinforcements.
Following the devastation caused by Hurricane 
Katrina, many Tulane students were displaced 
to numerous universities around the country. 
Carnegie Mellon was fortunate enough to host a 
number of them. But it raises a question... does it 
really take a catastrophic event to bring an influx of 
dynamic, wild students to our campus and liven up 
the environment, as the Tulane kids did for us?

Bringing nature to a tech-sawy campus
Naturalist Eustace Conway comes to Carnegie Mellon
Championing the phrase "use it up, wear it out, make it do, 
or do without," Eustace Conway did not use running water 
or electricity for 20 years while camping in the woods of 
North Carolina. Given that, hearing Conway speak at such a 
technology-driven school as Carnegie Mellon last Thursday 
night was quite a juxtaposition. However, Conway seemed 
as comfortable speaking within concrete walls as any of us 
would be, peppering his lecture with clever anecdotes and 
lighthearted comparisons between the modern world and the 
world he lives in.
Introduced by Tomasz Skowronski, AB Lectures chair,
Conway was welcomed warmly by a mixed audience of 
students, faculty, and other curious Pittsburghers. Conway 
began by offering his different perspective on the world.
He has lived most of his 45 years in his Turtle Island nature 
preserve, named after a Native American folktale in which 
the earth is supported by a giant turtle. Through Conways 
eyes, the earth itself is a female entity that gives us life," 
but modem American society is "destroying itself like a 
bad cancer." Conway blames much of this deterioration on 
consumerism. Corporations, he said, have put a "blinder" 
on Americans about where their food, clothing, and other 
everyday items come from.
In one particular anecdote, Conway told the audience of an 
elementary school girl who was appalled by his handmade 
deerskin jacket. He pointed out to our more mature audience 
that the cotton clothing most of us wear daily is produced 
through raping the landscape" of its natural plants to make 
way for the mono-crop, as opposed to his jacket that was 
made with a natural, renewable resource. Conway explained 
that the necessity to hunt, skin, and tan the skins of five deer 
to make his jacket made him appreciate the "specialness 
and sacredness of life gone. As he pointed out, he also used 
every part of those deer, from the toenails, hanging from his 
shoulder to remind him of the deers sacrifice, down to the 
tendons, which he used as both thread and dental floss.
Conway noted how disappointed he was at seeing a kiosk at 
an airport that was supposed to educate people on science, 
but only offered interaction with a computer screen and 
buttons, without any hands-on experience. He did, however, 
dismiss the absurdity as reasonable. "If thats what it takes..."
Conway explained that most people in urban societies 
have "spiritual deprivation and are not in tune with their 
surroundings. This is understandable, he continued, since 
there' is so much stimulation in the modern world that we 
are forced to tune out and only pick certain things to pay 
attention to. While elaborating on such stimulations, he noted 
that he had only ever seen two iPods, receiving chuckles from 
the audience when coming to a loss for words to describe 
them as any more than "little things.
After speaking for a half hour, Conway turned to the audience 
for questions. One person asked if there was perhaps a middle 
ground between his natural way of living and the modern 
experience. Conway replied to this by pointing out that 
he does use a few modern tools, such as plastic buckets, a
chainsaw, and a truck. He also explained, jokingly, that he 
chooses to wear manufactured jeans in order to not look too 
weird when he gives lectures. In response to a question about 
hostile environments, Conway pointed out that the modern 
world is much more hostile than any natural habitat, since 
nature is predictable. "I don't get poison ivy cause I dont 
touch it! Why would I touch it?" he exclaimed to note the 
simplicity of dealing with natural surroundings.
Conway also related his environmental advice to economics. 
When making a decision, we should consider how much 
good versus how much detriment is coming out of it, a 
simple cost-benefit analysis. Conway explained that he used 
this analysis when he finally'used toilet paper three years 
ago for the first time in over two decades. Previously, he had 
used leaves he had found. Toilet paper, something he claimed 
Carnegie Mellon students take for granted from Housing 
Services, should be used preciously.... It is a gift; it is a 
dream," a pointed example of how alternative his lifestyle is.
Conway concluded the evening by explaining that our whole 
culture needs to make a more meaningful experience, and we 
all need to get involved in reality. As audience members got 
up to leave, Skowronski returned to invite everyone to a small 
reception in the hall. The selection of vegan refreshments 
including organic soda, salad, and organic corn chips with 
hummus fit right in with the event's notion of natural living. 
Despite the free reception, many people stayed in the 
auditorium to purchase books and personally thank Conway 
for coming, a testament of just how fascinating Eustace 
Conway's life experiences are.

Bela Fleck and the Flecktones play Pittsburgh
Two different views on the best and worst of their latest performance
Matts Big 3
What I Liked: The Individual Musicianship
Bela Fleck and The Flecktones are associated with many 
scenes: the hippie-friendly jam band scene, the evertalented but ever-pretentious jazz scene, and the down-south 
bluegrass scene. One thing that sets the group apart in every 
one of these categories, however, is the fabulous individual 
musicianship that each of Flecktones brings to the plate.
Future Man (a.k.a. Roy Wooten), the groups "drummer, 
actually plays what he calls a Synth-axe Drumitar. The - 
instrument, shaped like an electric guitar, is loaded with 
buttons that activate artificial drum and percussion sounds. 
But because of his competency on the real drum set, which he 
played occasionally at Tuesday nights performance, he is able 
to groove just like a live drummer should.
Victor Wooten, Future Mans brother and the Flecktones 
bassist, is well, simply amazing. Vic was left alone onstage 
in the middle of the first set for a solo, and, boy, did he 
impress. Whether it was breezing through the melody of The 
Beatles "Norwegian Wood" or setting up dozens of loops of 
his own playing and jamming over them, Wooten proved he 
was not only a technical beast, but also a true innovator of his 
instrument.
Jeff Coffin, the group's saxophone and clarinetist, trained at 
the prestigious University of North Texas, and has studied 
under jazz saxophone giant Joe Lovano. Coffins jazz 
technique undoubtedly came through at the concert Tuesday, 
as he blew through tracks with ferocious bebop licks with 
ease and clarity.
Fleck himself is no exception to the trend. With the technique 
of a bluegrass banjo player, the compositional prowess of 
John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the instrumental 
innovation of Jimi Hendrix, Fleck spits out good ol bluegrass 
lines on "Kaleidoscope, writes fabulous jazz harmonies on 
the downtown New York-inspired Whos Got Three? and 
catchy melodies on The Whistle Tune, and plays like a rock 
guitarist, with crunchy and incendiary lines, on the ever-funky 
rock of Subterfuge. 
The individual technique, of course, comes together in 
the groups stunning chemistry. As good as they were as 
individual musicians, they were even better as a band. During 
the shows closer, Stomping Grounds, the guys traded $ 
solos with each other like jazz musicians, grooved like funk 
musicians, and built intensity to the songs climax with the 
psychic powers of a jam band.
stopping to talk between songs or even give a hint of a smile 
as they play, the Flecktones never ceased to amuse and 
entertain the audience. Between the moments of fabulous . 
playing came moments of hilarity, as band members teased 
each other, debating who should get songwriting credit for 
"PLod Is In The House," or whether or not Future Man is, 
well, from the future. With such a unique fan base of jazz cats 
and hippies alike, the Flecktones always made sure everyone 
in the audience was having a good time.
What I Didnt Like
Although Vics solo was virtuosic and awe-inspiring to a 
youngster bass player, and although it was fun to watch just 
Fleck and Future Man jam together at the beginning of the 
second set, I wish there could have been a little more time 
devoted to the groups playing. Since every member has a 
solo project of his own, the two-hour-plus concert should really 
be Flecktones time. If solo breaks are necessary (which they 
are), they should have been cut down.
Matt Siffert | Staffwriter
What I Liked: The Flecktones Were True Performers
While some groups take their work far too seriously, never
Pats Big 3
What I Liked: Diversity of Musical Style
Just taking a quick glance at the instruments that the band's 
members play shows all the different stylistic influences that 
affect the music they play. Flecks electric banjo seems to say 
pretty clearly: This band is something completely different.
At th same time, the Flecktones present audiences with a 
wide range of musical styles. From bluegrass to jazz, rock and 
roll to classical, the Flecktones touch on pretty much every 
musical style to create something unique.
For Weed Whacker, the Flecktones opening song, the 
members traded phrases in improvisation around the song's 
main theme, reminding the audience of a jazz performance. 
Fleck would rip out a few measures on the banjo, and then 
pass the melody he'd created over to Coffin, who would then 
wail on it for a while and hand it off to Wooten. All the while, 
the audience heard bebop from Coffins saxophone and 
bluegrass breakdowns from Flecks banjo.
As the band launched into Chennai," things got a bit out 
there. Future Man and Coffin performed throat singing, a 
technique where one singer can produce two pitches, and 
Coffin played a Tibetan singing bowl. The band went through 
a raga, a classical Indian rhythm and progression, while 
continuing to trade phrases in improvisation.
During the two sets, the band played mostly songs from their 
most recent album, The Hidden Land, but also mixed in a few 
older tunes, including Sinister Minister as the encore and 
covers of the Beatles songs "Norwegian Wood and Come 
Together. During his solo time on stage, Fleck also played a 
decorated rendition of the traditional song "Theres No Place 
Like Home."
What I Liked: Audience Diversity
Covering so many musical styles, it should come as no 
surprise that Bela Fleck and the Flecktones appeal to a wide 
range of listeners. Sitting in the auditorium last Tuesday, 
audience members found themselves surrounded by quite a 
motley throng.
There were people dressed in tie-dyed T-shirts, and others 
in collared golf shirts; fans sported every hairstyle from 
dreadlocks to cue balls. More than a few people came to the 
show, which had been billed as part of the Mellon Jazz Series, 
dressed in sharp suits and ties, while many others opted for 
patchwork pants and skirts. There were young kids there, 
teenagers, college students, middle-agers, and old folks.
Most impressive was the fact that everyone got along 
famously. While the technical prowess of the musicians 
demanded the attention of most of the audience, the band 
managed to rivet devoted listeners to their seats, and inspired 
a few to do a hippy shuffle in the wings.
What I Didnt Like
Although Im fairly certain the lighting effects outweighed 
what might be expected from most ordinary jazz groups 
or bluegrass bands, with the talent behind the Flecktones 
I would have enjoyed a better light show. The simple solid 
color backdrop worked well, as did the stage lighting. Each 
of these sets of lights changed color as the mood of the music 
progressed and the technique worked well with music. 
However, the highlights left much to be desired. The spinning 
yin-yang with white and black bass clefs instead of little dots 
was just a little cheesy.
Patrick Pettibon | Staffwriter
Matt and Pats final lowdown on the Bela show
Three and a half stars: Despite the minor problems 
with the show, Bela Fleck and The Flecktones 
brought the house down on Tuesday night. They are 
fabulous musicians and entertainers that attract just 
an audience as diverse as the music they play, and 
although they may never make it into the mainstream 
like some jazz musicians or jam bands, they have 
carved out a special place in music history.

Far right: Four-year-old 
Nathaniel C. Shuty poses for 
the camera at the Pittsburgh 
Children's Museum.
Local museum captures childhood
Pittsburghs Childrens Museum attractive to all ages
I tried to fit my right leg, then my left. The tiny hole would 
not allow me to put through both my legs simultaneously, so 
sweating and grunting, I stuck one in, and then, exerting all 
of my upper arm strength, pulled myself up to the next level of 
the jungle gym. "You can do it! cheered the three-year-old to 
my right, who was easily maneuvering her little body through 
the obstacles in the multi-level play pen. "Isnt this fun?" she 
asked. Ah yes, the simple pleasures of childhood. And there is 
a way, just over a river and across some steel bridges, that you 
can travel backwards in time and have some real, juvenile fun.
The Children's Museum, located in the North Side of 
Pittsburgh, is a world of colors, sounds, and cushiony 
playthings. The building itself is ostensibly formal; it was 
originally the old post office of the city of Allegheny (the 
original name of the North Side before its annexation to 
Pittsburgh) and is a beautiful example of Italian Renaissance 
design. The interior was remodeled in 1983 to fit the playful, 
creative atmosphere of the Childrens Museum, which opened 
that year.
Although most of the museum's exhibits are directed toward 
children ages two to 10, there are plenty of ways a college 
student can have fun. Take the human maze, for example.
This story-high, plastic-enclosed crawl space is a tight fit 
even for shorter young adults, but if you arent afraid to 
contort your body into weird positions, or perhaps look like 
an idiot in front of gawking mothers and their strollers, it is 
definitely something to try.
The museum is separated into different rooms, each with 
its own theme. In Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, replicas of the 
early-morning television star's cardigans are available to try 
on. In the Garage Workshop, a future Carnegie Mellon buggy 
engineer can leam about the aerodynamics of a car. Each 
room has many different stations, so there are no lines and no 
boredom. Everything is hands-on and interactive, such as the 
life-size ball machine that uses a pulley to send a plastic ball 
twisting and turning through metal chutes around the ceiling 
of the Garage Workshop, or the light show that projects your 
Technicolor silhouette onto a screen, which may make you 
feel as if you are in a Gnarls Barkley video.
Of course, in order to take full advantage of the museum, one 
must be in the mood to be silly. Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, 
for example, allows you to try your hand as a trolley driver 
on the neighborhood road, or play dress-up in the pink and 
purple castle alongside three- and four-year-olds. Follow the 
colorful stone pathway to another station to be nostalgic while 
watching Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood reruns. The Attic plays 
with your mind and tests your center of gravity by creating an 
Alice-in-Wonderland-type room that makes you feel like you 
may have gone party-hopping instead. Each room is a bustle 
of activity, as everyone, kids and parents (and thrill-seeking 
Carnegie Mellon students) included, are having a blast.
When asked if many college-aged students come to the 
museum, Jess Checketts, a museum employee, said that older 
visitors are "few and far between. However, when asked if
she likes to play with the museums many attractions, her 
response was very enthusiastic: Oh yes, absolutely! Thus, 
The Childrens Museum is somewhat of a hidden jewel, 
fulfilling all of ones hidden desires to climb, crawl, jump, and 
play in a setting where this kind of behavior is acceptable for 
all ages.
Whether you are an art major, scientist, or athlete, this 
museum has something for everyone. Unlimited silkscreen 
and monoprinting supplies are available for those more 
attuned to the right brain. Exhibits brought in from the 
Exploratorium in San Francisco can help you put your biology 
homework into perspective, and the unlimited amount of 
crawling through tight spaces will do more for your body than 
any yoga workout. So why not stop playing grown-up for a 
day, and take a trip to the Childrens Museum?
The Children's Museum is located at 10 Children's Way, 
Allegheny Square, Pittsburgh, and is open from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Monday through Saturday, and from noon to 5 p.m. on 
Sunday. Admission is $9 for students, and there is a half-price 
discount on weekdays throughout the month of September. 
Upcoming exhibits: "Fact or Fiction," a science-based exhibit 
brought in from the San Francisco Exploratorium, is open 
through October 1; the Fall Festival of Children's Books is on 
October 20.

SPAMALOT takes the local stage
Catapulting cows and killer rabbits bring Monty Python to life again
The legends of King Arthur and the knights of the Round 
Table tell a story of the noblest of Englands leaders. Monty 
Python's SPAMALOT sets the same tale to music... kind of. 
Perhaps the tagline says it best: "A new musical lovingly' 
ripped off from the motion picture Monty Python and the 
Holy Grail." Now on its North American tour, the musical 
has come to Pittsburgh through Sunday, October 1, at the 
Benedum Center.
A humorous mockery of Arthurian legend, SPAMALOT finds 
King Arthur and his knights on a quest from God to find the 
Holy Grail. The classics from the movie, such as the French 
taunter (catapulter of cows), the killer rabbit, the Black 
Knight, the fair Prince Herbert, the Book of Armaments (a 
lampoon of the Bible), the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, 
and the Knights Who Say Ni, make an appearance. The 
Knights Who Say Ni scene is a riot with comedic tension 
palpable during simple silent stares between the actors.
For those old enough to remember the original Monty 
Python (most of The Tartans audience probably wasnt 
even conceived when Monty Python and the Holy Grail was 
first released in 1975), the nostalgia you carry for the sketch 
comedy show is exactly what will make you want to see this 
musical.
But is that enough? With a 2005 Tony Award, a bevy of 
praise, and rave reviews, SPAMALOT certainly has shown 
itself to be a popular and commercial success on Broadway 
and now across the country. The people behind SPAMALOT
have replicated a great formula: Take a cultural phenomena of 
the past 30 years, update it with some current jokes and turn 
it into (a) a movie, (b) a musical, (c) a video game, (d) a play, 
or (e) all of the above. Take the Marvel superhero movies like 
X-Men, Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, or Daredevil comics. 
Take the surprising popularity of the video game LEGO Star 
Wars 2. Some are worthwhile productions with something 
to say about contemporary American society (such as the 
X-Men series advocating gay rights), but many just end up 
looking like cash-ins on intellectual properties faded from the 
limelight.
Monty Pythons SPAMALOT, directed by Tony Award winner 
Mike Nichols, feels like a slick commercial production and 
not like the postmodern British comedy show of the 1970s. 
The humor does not push the envelope. Hardcore Monty 
Python fans who expect a new dose of the classic wit will 
be disappointed. Written by Eric Idle, an original Python, 
SPAMALOT is about 70 percent verbatim Holy Grail. It does 
not invent too many new jokes in the Monty Python style, but 
instead recycles old material with some topical updates.
SPAMALOT makes a number of references to American 
culture, some funnier than others. It pokes very subtle fun at 
the Bush administration, lampoons an adult version of Disney 
World (a.k.a. Las Vegas with Tina T\imer), and reinforces the 
popular notion of gay-nightlife culture. SPAMALOT is weak 
on the political satire and unfortunately relies on fart jokes 
and physical comedy for about a third of its laughs. Double 
entendres make up another half. When Idle did write new
material, he played it safe and simple like the commercial 
production that SPAMALOT is.
Although SPAMALOT follows the Holy Grail storyline close 
enough for immediate recognition, recreating many of 
the same scenes that made the British motion picture a 
cult classic, one should never forget that it is a Broadway 
musical. Keeping this in mind, SPAMALOT, complete with 
show-stopping musical numbers and two weddings, is quite 
enjoyable. The production, singing, acting, and musical 
performances are top-notch. SPAMALOT is accessible to 
everyone, Monty Python fan or not, who enjoys lighthearted 
comedy and the "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life 
atmosphere of a Broadway show. But beware, for something 
wicked this way comes: In 20 years, we may see a musical 
based on The Simpsons or Family Guy.

These aint no one-hit wonders
Justin Timberlake, Bob Dylan, and The Roots release top tracks
Justin Timberlake
FutureSex/LoveSounds
I really, really, really wanted to hate Justin Timberlakes new 
record. SexyBack," the records first single, is club-friendly, 
but really had nothing going for it: dull backbeat, depressingly 
artificial synthesizers, trite distorted vocals, and, of course, 
the hair-pulling-out-inspiring Take em to the briiiidge! and 
"Take 'em to the chooorusi interspersed between different 
sections of the song. It didn't leave a good first impression 
to a music snob like me. But as I played through the record, 
"SexyBack 's atrocity seemed to fade away as other tracks 
proved themselves more worthy and musically engaged. On 
"Pose, Timberlake and guest Snoop Dogg pelvic-thrust their 
way through the '80s glam-funk, singing, "Let me take your 
picture/Pose for my camera/Lookin' like a model, lookin like a 
superstar/You're out of sight/So pose, pose, pose. Sure, maybe 
Timberlake's music isn't for the ages, but he sure is having fun.
On "Chop Me Up," Timberlake finds himself (somehow) 
together with FutuieSex's primary producer Timbaland and 
rap group Three 6 Mafia. And, although you think hell never 
make it through the track alive, he holds his ground and gels 
with his seemingly intimidating song-mates. On the Motowninfluenced "Damn Girl, Timberlake and producer/vocalist of 
the Black Eyed Peas will.i.am combine a funky rhythm section 
with gospel and soul-influenced vocals. On "Summer Love/The 
Mood Prelude, Timberlake makes his mandatory hip-pop ' 
track, with Hollaback Girl-influenced drumming and London 
Bridge-influenced synthesizers. But, in true Timberlake 
fashion, there's always a complication. Despite the shameless 
proclamations of Tell me how they got that pretty little face 
on that pretty little frame.... I can't wait to fall in love with 
you/You cant wait to fall in love with me at the beginning of 
the track, Timberlake, now past his naive teen-bop years, shifts 
the time into a power ballad, wisely singing, We gotta set the 
mood right/To make you feel all right... Im.gonna make you 
feel good tonight."
I guess Timberlake once again defied my expectations. Im not 
going to rave about the record, but I will let my defenses down, 
and, for once in my life, believe in Timberlakes contagious 
personality; always happy, always romantic.
Bob Dylan
Modem Times
Bob Dylan's new record is, by all means, a safe record. In his 
success and old age, he has lost his innovation and firebrand 
mentality that defined a generation, some 40 years ago.
In his new record, Dylan settles on love songs and blues 
numbers, leaving his days of rebellion behind, allowing for the 
youngsters of today to pick up the slack. The result, therefore, 
is a record that hints at Dylan's magnificent past, but more 
importantly illuminates Dylan not just as a generational icon, 
but a good musician.
Fans of I'll Be Your Baby Tonight and "Positively 4th 
Street" will be happy to hear new Dylans record. Backed by 
a blues-rock group, Dylans approach is low-key, romantic, 
and sentimental. In the opening number, "Thunder On The 
Mountain," Dylan's backing band lays down an old countryblues shuffle beat as Dylan ponders, "Ive been sittin down 
studyin the art of love/I think it will fit me like a cjlove/I want 
some real good woman to do just what I say/Everybody got to 
wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today.
It is this somewhat awkward collision between romance and 
pontification that makes up Dylan's new record. In Spirit On 
The Water," Dylan sings in isolation to his lost lover, all the 
while still self-conscious about the old age he rejects, singing, 
You think I'm over the hill/You think I'm past my prime/Let 
me see what you got/We can have a whoppin' good time."
And amid all the long songs and stories that Dylan offers up on 
Modem Times, he clearly shies away from reflection, nostalgia, 
or songs about growing old. Dylans peppy, feel-good band and 
his new arsenal of songs reveal a youthful, energetic Dylan that 
hasnt emerged in years. Well Bob, its good to have you back. 
Have a drug of your choice on us.
The Roots
Game Theory
With an illustrious 15-year career under their belt, its about 
time The Roots put out a record like Game Theory. Recently 
signed to rap icon Jay-Z's (a.k.a. Sean Carter) Island/Def Jam 
Records, The Roots have made an uncannily abrupt shift from 
the jazz and neo-soul influenced hip-hop that sprung them into 
the mainstream in the early 90s to edgy, contemporary rap.
' In Game Theory, The Roots finally assert themselves as a group 
proud of their sophisticated arsenal of influences, including 
the likes of the late legendary producer J. Dillah (to whom 
the record is dedicated) and Sly and the Family Stone, while 
adding the grit, tude, and swagger that their boss, Jay-Z, so 
magnificently mastered in his own records. If Things Fall Apart 
was The Roots attempt to get street cred in the pop world, 
Phrenology an attempt to shed more sophisticated, prog-rock/ 
concept material, and The Tipping Point a somewhat failed 
attempt to balance everything together, then Game Theory is 
The Roots proclamation that it is time to take them seriously 
as a hip-hop/rap group. And although on Dont Feel Right" 
the featured singer Maimouna Youssef sings It seems as 
though nowadays things have changed, I dont know if I feel 
the same, The Roots are quite comfortable moving on. On 
the record's first single, Here I Come," the groups confidence 
pounds with heavy synth patterns, a snapping snare drum 
from master drummer Ahmir ?uestlove Thompson, and a 
vocal hook from Roots MC Black Thought that's sure to scare 
away the doubters: You better come out with your hands 
up/We got you surrounded.... You boys get ready, 'cuz here I 
come.
With such a rich history, a savvy group like The Roots will 
never forget its, well, roots. On Long Time, ?uestlove rips 
through a Clyde Stubblefield-influenced breakbeat, with 
guitar strumming sure to bring the days of James Brown and 
Parliament. And while the live band element of The Roots 
that defined their ever-jazzy Do You Want More?!!!??! debut is 
completely lost (bassist Leonard "Hub" Hubbard is completely 
denied any breathing room on Game Theory), you cant help. 
but appreciate the risk and vanguard behind this record. And 
although part of me misses Scott Storch on the fender Rhodes,
. "Hub" on the upright bass, and newly reunited MC Malik B on 
the mic full-time beside the rapidly declining Black Thought, 
the other part of me knows that as long as The Roots are still 
playing with passion and energy  which, as undeniably 
seen in this record, they are  they're heading in the right 
direction.

Installation art invades North Side
Mattress Factory opens a new exhibit and gets a new neighbor
Looking for-a new Posturpedic bed? The Mattress Factory 
isnt the place for that. Instead of mattresses, there are 
amazing art installations. Last weekend, the Mattress Factory 
opened not only a new exhibit, but also a brand-new affiliated 
museum next door.
The Mattress Factorys latest exhibit, called Factory 
Installed, is a presentation of installations by various artists 
and has been in the making for three to five years. "Artists 
are selected one to two years in advance. Communication 
begins with them right away, said Meredith Knight, the 
communications manager of the Mattress Factory. A few 
months before the exhibition is scheduled to open, they come 
to the museum, live in an apartment building we own for 
them, and create their work.
The new works at the Mattress Factory are, for the most 
part, stunning. The piece that affected viewers the most was 
easily Jesse Bercowetz and Matt Buas "Ships, Chips, and the 
Stack of Documents. The focal point of the piece is a large 
torture chair, constructed of a reclining chair, rope, and other 
objects. Bercowetz and Bua constructed this piece in such a 
way that even the most ordinary of objects, such as a table 
fork, looked threatening and lethal. Inside the room of their 
piece, there was a tension in the air, exacerbated by dull red 
lights, the sound of a steady drip of water, and fog. Around 
the chair, the viewer could hear different media blaring, such 
as an interview with one of the September 11 hijackers exgirlfriends and an audio recording that discusses the idea that 
September 11 was in fact a conspiracy by the government.
"It was so grotesque that I wanted to look away, but at the 
same time, so well-done that I couldn't," said sophomore 
computer science major Alissa Briggs.
According to Knight, the Mattress Factory was not concerned 
with the controversial nature of Ships, Chips, and the Stack 
of Documents." Knight stated, "The museums mission is to 
select artists based on their previous work, and then give 
them free range to do what they want when they are here ... 
with our full support and assistance no matter what. Our job is 
simply to support [the artists] as they create new work!"
Another awe-inspiring piece was Deborah Aschheims On 
Memory. The piece, which was constructed out of LEDs, 
video, and plastic, looks like something out of The Matrix."
It has "nerve cell sculptures that are suspended from the 
ceiling. Inside each sculpture is a television that plays a video 
that is someone's memory. The video images are stunning; 
they are moments everyone has lived through but no one ever 
documents, such as a childs first bike ride. What is more
stunning than the videos are the sculptures. The nerves that 
bind the sculptures to the floor and ceiling were hand-sewn 
out of plastic bathmats.
It was like the nerves were connecting all these memories 
together and tying the people to their families, said 
sophomore materials science and biomedical engineering 
major Maria Gatica.
Other materials used to create On Memory were baby cams, 
infrared monitoring devices, home security motion detectors, 
and spy cameras. These were used to create the sense of 
"a sprawling, sensing, and reactive sculptural network, as 
Knight stated. "Deborah was here and worked for months 
to create that piece in the gallery. It was a very amazing 
process."
One of the other pieces that is open until January 28 is Dan 
Steinhilbers Untitled. Constructed of fans, a plastic tarp, 
rope, an electronic timer, and Styrofoam peanuts, this piece 
was definitely one-of-a-kind. Fans blew the tarp so that 
viewers could walk over to the other side of the room and sit 
on the Styrofoam peanuts, which were encased in a garbage 
bag. This piece was not as popular as some of the others in 
the exhibit; however, it was amusing to see the tarp suddenly 
collapse on people because the timer had stopped the fans 
from turning.
The same night that Factory Installed opened, a small house 
next door to the Mattress Factory was brought to life. The 
house, known as the The Tom Museum, was opened to 
the public. The Tom Museum is a project of Tom Sarver, 
a Pittsburgh-based puppeteer. According to Sarver, The 
project is designed to illustrate my complete artistic vision by 
making public my process of experimentation, development, 
and construction. The house consists of three floors, each of 
which houses a different exhibit. By the end of the fall, The 
Tom Museum will consist of four floors. The new floor will 
have an installation inspired by wind power.
Although the museum sounds like it will eventually be an 
interesting place for viewers of all ages, it is currently in 
the process of adding the fourth floor. The best advice is 
to probably postpone a trip to it, at least for a few months.
On the other hand, try to get to the Mattress Factory before 
January 28, when Factory Installed closes. You wont regret 
visiting the Mattress Factorys amazing new exhibits; they 
are well worth the trip to the North Side.

Conner said that it was not until 1980 that 
the space was renamed the Hazlett 
Theater, after Ted Hazlett, ^
the man who . .
had
Opening night: the twittering excitement of musicians and 
actors, the frantic rushing of the stage crew, and the vital 
sound checks repeated ceaselessly. One flaw can destroy the 
players' spirits, .but deafening applause can signal the weight 
lifted from their backs. It was opening night at the Hazlett 
Theater this weekend, but while all the people in it were 
checking, rushing, and preparing, it was the old building that 
was the focus. People were coming to see the show, yes, but 
the theater itself was the star this time around. After years 
of sitting in grand silence in the North Side, the New Hazlett 
Theater is reopening its doors and starting anew.
Act 1: The Theater as it Was
The Hazlett Theater, now called the New Hazlett Theater, is 
the most recently renovated theater in Pittsburgh. Beginning 
in 1984, when the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust turned the 
Stanley Theater into the Benedum Center, newly renovated 
theaters have been bom in the spaces that once housed 
vaudeville show houses and early movie theaters. The surge 
of renovations by the Cultural Trust is due to the work of 
Jack Heinz, who hoped to transform a red-light district into 
a Cultural District, wrote Veronica Corpuz, public relations 
manager for the Cultural Trust, via e-mail. The Hazlett 
restoration, however, was undertaken by a new non-profit 
organization: the New Hazlett Center for the Performing 
Arts. Oversight for the theater comes from a number 
of groups, including the Childrens Museum 
and the Andy Warhol Museum.
The opening of the 2006-2007 
season at New Hazlett will continue 
a tradition for arts and performance that 
began on the very spot, in the very 
same building, 117 years ago. In 1889 
the building was created as the 
Carnegie Free Library
and Music Hall; the words Carnegie Hall" are chiseled into 
the stone above New Hazlett's doorway today.
Yet for all the rich history of the place, it might have never 
lived to be called New Hazlett Theater. The building itself 
was to be tom down in the late 60s, said Sara Radelet, the 
executive director of the New Hazlett, The community sort of 
rallied and prevented that from happening."
When renovations ended in 1972, patrons found themselves 
in a very different type of theater, one with a new name: the 
Allegheny Community Theater. Where once the theater had 
a very traditional look, in the new space, "all the plaster was 
removed to get down to bare brick walls and there was an
^intricate lighting system....
It created this very 
industrial feel, said 
Radelet. The seating, 
she said, was on 
movable risers to 
allow the theater 
to be set up in 
different ways, 
such as theater 
in the round 
style or a 
thrust/
three-quarters configuration (with the audience on three 
sides). The space was rented out by various groups and grew 
to be known as a haven for public theater.
Intermission: A Few Too Many Tenants
The first theater company to rent out the Allegheny 
Community Theater was Carnegie Mellon-born. The original 
tenant was the Pittsburgh Playhouses Vanguard Theatre 
Project  a professional touring company that produced 
plays for high school- and college-aged students that had 
been founded by Carnegie Mellon-trained actors and faculty 
members in 1962, wrote Lynne Conner, summarizing from 
her book Pittsburgh in Stages: Two Hundred Years of Theater, 
to be published this spring.
From 1974 to 1979, various groups took up the space, 
including the City Players (currently the City Theatre 
Company), which was the first and only theater 
company fully funded and sponsored by the city of 
Pittsburgh, according to Conner.

headed both the A.W. Mellon Foundation and the effort to 
create the Allegheny Community Theater. By that time, 
Pittsburgh Public Theater was the sole performing group at the 
venue, and when the OReilly Theater was built closer to the 
heart of the Cultural District, the Public Theater moved to that 
venue.
The city continued to rent the Hazlett to various groups. The 
issue was that nobody was using [the Hazlett Theater] time 
and again," Radelet said. Each group had to move in and start 
from scratch." Without a staff of its own, the Hazlett Theater 
became too much of a hassle to perform in, even for the groups 
that loved it. Until New Hazlett Center for the Performing Arts 
came along, the theater had been mostly dormant since 2001. 
it was then that the Hazlett Theater experienced its second 
resurgence.
Act 2: Let's Take it from the Top
In 2005, when renovations were being planned, it had been 
years since the Hazlett Theater had been maintained yearround. There were problems with water damage, said Radelet, 
and there were insufficient public restrooms and unsavory 
backstage conditions. All of this would have to be changed 
in order to create a successful new beginning for the Hazlett 
Theater.
One thing, however, had to stay the same: the very heart,
*"the performance area itself. Wayne Brinda, who served on 
the board of directors for the New Hazlett Theater, recalled 
another board member urging them not to change the theater 
itself. While the lobby, backstage areas, and catwalks were all 
replaced or renovated, the theater was left alone as requested.
On the theater's opening weekend, plenty of the old exposed 
brick that Brinda and Radelet both called attention to remained 
visible. The renovations are so freshly done that the sharp 
chemical smell of new paint and carpet still hits patrons as 
they walk through the door. The chairs in the theater still 
look like theyve seen their share of days, their small widths 
speaking of a time before luxury movie theater seats at places 
like Loews.

The stage" as it was set up this time was really just the floor; 
the front-row-seat audience could put their feet on the same 
level as the actors. In preparation for Saturday evening's 
performance by Dan Zanes and Friends, musicians tuned up 
and sound checks echoed through the chamber. There were 
few people, but every one of them (including Radelet) was 
moving in a ceaseless pattern of straightening and adjusting. 
The contrast between the rough light red bricks and the pale 
shining wood of the ticket counter strikes guests immediately. 
As Brinda put it, Its the old Hazlett from the perspective 
of the audience because of the stage. Its the New Hazlett 
because of the new equipment and because of the new lobby."
Brinda's theater company, Prime Stage, will be performing its 
entire 10th anniversary season at the New Hazlett Theater, but 
it performed there back in the days when it was being rented 
by the city as well. "Performers [and] audiences love going 
there," said Brinda of the theater. "Its a facility that a lot of 
people love. There's something magical about it."
Brinda lived through the years when the Hazlett Theater was 
in less than the greatest repair. No one was really taking care 
of the theater," he said. "A lot of us had to pretty much fend 
for ourselves." Despite the shortcomings, Brinda still feels the 
theater was a great place to work. It's the closeness and the 
ruggedness of the theater," he said. You anticipate having an 
experience there because its a three-quarter and the focus is 
on the performance.... It focuses on the story being told; being 
close to the actors, you can feel things with them, you can 
appreciate whats going on."
It really is nice to go back to that space," Brinda said.
We loved it and our audiences loved it." When the theater 
company announced it was returning to the space, he said he 
felt like everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief.
Prime Stage will begin its season with The Crucible and will 
also be showing To Kill a Mockingbird, The Diary of Anne 
Frank, and Jack and Rochelle at the New Hazlett Theater.
In addition to a full season by Prime Stage, the New Hazlett 
will feature many collaborative performances. During the
2006-2007 season, the theater will host collaborations between
the Childrens Museum and the Manchester Craftsmens Guild 
and between the Andy Warhol Museum and the August Wilson 
Center for African American Culture. The theater will also host 
Attack Theatre, Dance Alloy, the Pittsburgh Music Theater, 
and the Pittsburgh Opera throughout the season, according to 
Radelet.
In keeping with the spirit of Prime Stage, which gears itself 
towards producing works that can be suitable for young people 
and enjoyed by adults, the New Hazlett will open its doors to 
a wide variety of performances. Radelet said her goal for the 
theater was to generate a culture here ... where all age groups 
... feel they have a connection to it.
Curtain Call
Today the staff at the New Hazlett will be cleaning up after 
the festivities of this past weekend's opening events and 
preparing for what comes after the parties are over. They will 
be setting about the business of preparing for a whole season 
of performances from a large range of arts and theater groups.
The reopening of the New Hazlett, then, will be marked as 
another of several theaters and arts venues to start fresh in 
the past two decades or so. The long term plans for the New 
Hazlett include making Pittsburgh (and the theater) a new stop 
along the touring routes of musical groups. Even now, however, 
the reopening has bolstered the community, according to 
Radelet and Brinda.
"That's why all of us were so focused and committed to getting 
this thing reopened again, said Brinda. "It's almost like going 
back to the way it was when it started. Its a home for the 
region, not just one theater company. It's a theater for the 
community, its a theater for the region, and really thats what 
it was intended to be.

A look at the PSOs new season
The symphony offers something for everyone this year
There are certain things that are an unavoidable part of 
Pittsburgh: the Steelers, bridges, ketchup. At least, that's 
what hometown pride dictates. Europeans, on the other 
hand, don't associate Pittsburgh with football; rather, 
they think about the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
(PSO). The PSO is a world-class orchestra that puts 
Pittsburgh on the music map; the PSO has had several 
very successful European tours in the last couple of 
years.
The 2006-2007 PSO concert season has something for 
everyone, whether youre a painter, a literature student, 
an architect, a feminist, or a culture buff. There are 
certain features of music that apply to many different 
fields of study.
This PSO season is full of exciting programs. Cynthia 
Koledo DeAlmeida, principal oboe of the PSO and a 
professor in the music department at Carnegie Mellon, 
said, "It is hard for me to pick one special concert
 I love so many of the pieces we will be playing this 
season."
The PSOs opening concert, on Friday, September
29, features Rimsky-Korsakovs Scheherazade. This 
concert will be very appealing to painters and art 
students because Rimsky-Korsakov was a master at 
orchestration. He created wonderful colors by combining 
different instruments. Scheherazade is a swirling pool 
of color. Just like painters, composers must take color 
into consideration. Painters think about texture just as 
composers think about texture.
The connection between musical color and actual color 
can be more than a metaphor. One composer, Olivier 
Messiaen (1908-1992), had a type of synesthesia that 
caused him to perceive certain colors when he heard 
certain harmonies. Synesthesia is a neurological 
condition in which two or more senses are fused. 
Rimsky-Korsakov had synesthesia as well.
DeAlmeida highlighted the opening concert. The 
audience will hear many fascinating and hauntingly 
beautiful melodies from solo instruments throughout the 
orchestra, she said. "I believe that the more a listener 
recognizes these different voices in the orchestra, the 
more interested and engaged they become in the music.
Students of literature should find many interesting 
concerts this season, too. Many composers found 
inspiration in literature. On Friday, October 30, the PSO 
will perform Richard Strauss's piece for cello, violin, and 
orchestra, Don Quixote, subtitled Fantasy Variations 
on a Theme of Knightly Character. Here, Strauss gives 
a wonderfully detailed and humorous portrait of Don 
Quixote that rivals Cervantes'. And, of course, RimskyKorsakovs Scheherazade is based on The Book of One 
Thousand and One Nights, a great piece of Persian 
literature.
Architects might be surprised to discover that composers 
must also consider the architecture and shape of their 
music. Architects should check out Shostakovichs Fifth 
Symphony-, which will be performed on October 6. This 
bold symphony is all about gestures and shape. This
symphony has very powerful moments where the entire 
orchestra is playing. Here, the architect should listen to 
where instruments are playing (high or low), where they 
are going (are their notes ascending, or descending?), 
and the length for which they are played.
The classical period, which included Haydn and Mozart, 
was a return to the classical style of Greece. Music of 
the time adopted values of the other arts, particularly 
architecture, which valued order, economy, and 
balance. Architects then should look for these values in 
Mozarts Symphony No. 25, which will be performed on 
February 9.
While women's advocacy groups have had lots of success 
in recent years, many women overlook the position of 
women in classical music. In the classical music world, 
there have been many great female violinists, pianists, 
cellists, and singers, but women have generally not 
joined the ranks of the great conductors. There is one 
exception, however: Marin Alsop. Alsop will be the first 
woman to head a major American orchestra when she 
becomes music director for the Baltimore Symphony's
2007-2008 season. Alsop will conduct a concert on 
Friday, November 9.
Looking back through history, most composers have 
been male. There was no female counterpart for Mozart 
or Brahms. In the 20th-century, female composers 
became more prominent. The PSO will be premiering 
Sofia Gubaidulinas Feast During a Plague on December 
1. This piece was co-commissioned by the PSO and the 
Philadelphia Orchestra, which played it last year. Alex 
Ross, of The New Yorker, said of Feast During a Plague:
" [the Philadelphia premier] had the power of a prophetic 
utterance. Gubaidulina intended her work as an eagleeyed view of a riven world  abject misery on the one 
hand, empty-headed pleasure-seeking on the other
 and she found a potent metaphor for her vision." This 
piece has literary inspiration too: It is based on a text by 
Pushkin, which in turn was inspired by John Wilson's 
1816 poem The City of the Plague.
There are several national programs in this year's 
PSO season. For lovers of Spanish culture, the March 
16 concert will feature music by Spanish composers 
including Albeniz, Rodrigo, and de Falla. Another 
concert is called Nordic Nights" and will feature music 
of Grieg (from Norway) and Nielsen (from Denmark) on 
February 1. Russians should be interested in the October
6 concert, which marks the centennial of Shostakovichs 
birth with a program of his music, including Symphony 
No. 5 and the Piano Concerto No. 1.
Matthew E. Campbell | Staffwriter
On Thursday, September 14, Kimveer Gill opened fire on students 
at Dawson College in Montreal. Two hours before the shooting, he 
left a series of blog entries on his www.vampirefreaks.com profile. 
News reports inferred that he was disturbed, depressed, and goth. 
In a separate incident, Joshua Ballard posted his suicide note as a 
MySpace bulletin on November 29, 2005. Now eulogized in Internet 
phenomena, Ballard profiled himself on MySpace as emo.
Whats the point? As music becomes less centralized and more 
outlets open for musicians to export their music, the greater the 
need becomes to make the music more unique in order to stay 
afloat and the more convenient it becomes to tag on a new genre 
label. Combined with the attraction to attaching oneself to the visual 
image and identity of a particular genre, this breaks the lines of 
traditional discrimination into an area where prejudice, hierarchy, and 
gentrification should not exist.
Discrimination no longer takes place only in the form of race and 
gender, but also visual image. Because I listen to musicians like 
Marilyn Manson and Skinny Puppy (both musicians favored by Gill),
I may be apt to hurt my classmates. Because I am also supposedly 
"goth, that means I must hate fans of hip-hop or any other kind of 
genre, because people as a whole must be, in my mind, worthless, 
no good, betraying, and deceptive.
However, those who create invisible boundaries based on music and 
music-related culture are perhaps not only as odious as those they 
classify as bad people," but also fall victim to ignorance and the 
micro-genrefication of music.
Of course genres help to compare one type of music to another 
as a reference point. However, since music in general is such a 
quickly evolving art form, designating categories to contain them 
is an impossible feat. Sadly, as these genres become more over
defined, the groups of people who follow each get smaller and more 
specified, and upsettingly, discrimination may rise.
What is the solution? Expose yourself to music that might not 
necessarily fit your average breadth of musical taste. Immerse 
yourself in different kinds of people who subscribe to different 
images and cultures. Realize that most music today is influenced 
if not blatantly stolen from similar roots. Understand that music is 
aural, not visual. Image is tertiary in the order of what is important to 
music, not secondary, and most definitely not primary.

Big Als Metal Shop
Black Label Society and Lamb of God unleash guitars upon unsuspecting masses
A while back, I had a chance to review the latest Machine 
Head disc. What struck me then and now about the album 
was its timeless value as a headphones record. You know, 
the kind of epic that took you to another place after a hard 
day, an argument with your folks/old lady/old man/landlord. 
Slipping on a pair of headphones took you to a faraway place
 like Zeppelins II or Rushs 2112 a generation ago.
In today's overproduced world, it has been said there are 
fewer labels willing to take a chance on an album. It has 
become cliched to say that modem music is fixated on 
the single, the image, and the crossover marketing appeal 
an act can provide. And its largely true. The case can be 
made, then, that albums like Machine Head's should be 
considered an aberration, but as metal continues to carve 
out a comfortable niche for itself in the music industry, the 
reverse has actually occurred. More often than not, metal 
artists are now releasing polished, technically superior albums 
that will go a long way in defining this generations sound. 
One of the consequences of this freedom is the return of the 
guitar. A decade ago, it was considered cock-rock to want 
to shred  so thoroughly 80s. The early to late 90s are rife 
with examples of lame, ironic "rock" with no musical value. 
(Remember The Presidents of the blah blah blah  yeah, 
where are those guys now?) This is no longer the case as far 
as music goes. It may seem that R&B/hip-hop is the dominant 
genre now, but a look at the charts shows that metal, and 
specifically well-produced metal, also has a place in the heart 
of music lovers today.
As a result, the notion of the guitar solo as antiquated has 
gone the way of the dodo. For proof, one only has to look at 
the success of the PlayStation 2 game Guitar Hero and its 
highly anticipated sequel. Guitarists are now stepping back 
into the spotlight, and those with the skills and dedication 
to their craft are pushing album-oriented metal back into the 
little skulls of current and future metal-heads.
One of the guitarists that embodies that approach is Zakk 
Wylde. Yes, the berserker of Ozzy Osbourne fame. Every 
part the consummate player, Wylde brings his dominant 
personality to all he works on. Wylde's band, Black Label 
Society, has produced quality albums over the last decade, 
but on this latest they smack it out of the park. Equal parts 
bruiser and crooner, Shot To Hell is expertly forged metal. 
Well-arranged musically, Wylde layers his guitar over the 
bass-drum attack and his rusty vocals. Light and shade are 
utilized, but kept separate, thus escaping the trap most of 
todays four-words-in-their-name-emo-"metal" bands fall 
into. Although the opener, "Concrete Jungle," is considered 
the first single, it by no means encapsulates the richness of 
this album. Beautiful piano sequences on "New Religion 
and "Sick of it All" stand tall beside the guitar that follows 
naturally. "Sick of it All" reminds me a little of how Axl made 
it work on "November Rain," right before music got shafted in 
the '90s.
generation of American metal. One of the bands that has 
lead this charge, and whom you will be happy to know has 
made the cut on Guitar Hero 17, is Lamb of God. Their newest, 
Sacrament, hit the top 10 of the Billboard charts a few weeks 
ago when it was released. Their second on a major label, 
Sacrament finds these Virginians shredding instead of leading 
the pit with breakdowns and anthems like their last, Ashes 
of The Wake. Kicking off with "Walk With Me In Hell, Lamb 
of God embraces their Pantera influence. While Ashes was 
bluntly political, Sacrament is more of a misanthropic work 
lyrically. Still, this album reminds me of Trendkill-era Pantera
 the first single Redneck" especially so. As an album, 
Sacrament flows well, but to me isnt as memorable as Ashes 
of The Wake. The guitar work is a highlight here, but the 
overall construction isnt as vicious. There are songs that 
stand out; "Forgotten" could easily translate to a live setting, 
as could More Time To Kill. A very good album, certainly 
accessible to the casual rock/metal fan, but not my favorite. 
That title will continue to lie with Ashes.
Until the next time,
A1

had your appendix removed in the third grade.
You trade in your wrist communicator watch (see Taurus} for two

worth doing vintage.
You shave your head, quit World of Warcraft, have a threesome, and

Be careful bragging about your Sudoku skills: The Tartan has started 
posting the answers, so you cant just fill out the puzzles with random

Your drive-by arguments terrorize the Oakland area. This town used to

You caught a cold from all the funky weather. That chicken soup you
