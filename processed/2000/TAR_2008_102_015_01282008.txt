College study abroad is corrupt, subpoenas say
SABRINA PORTER
News Editor
Fifteen university study abroad 
offices have been charged with 
traveling too much, not from 
their home countries, but rather, 
from the law. New York Attorney 
General Andrew Cuomo issued 
subpoenas to these colleges and 
universities for entertaining 
corrupt alliances with specific 
third-party programs.
Subpoenas were issued to 
three third-party programs in 
August and September, and the 
investigation continued last 
Friday at several college and 
universities. The list of colleges 
in question includes Harvard, 
Columbia, Northwestern, and
Brown universities, among oth
ers.
Of the 15 colleges and 
universities questioned, only 
Alfred State University publicly 
acknowledged its subpoena. Al
fred States list of associations 
with third-party providers in
cluded the three first targeted 
by Cuomo. Although the sub
poenas were issued last Friday, 
most of the colleges and univer
sities have not yet revealed the 
exact contents of the subpoena 
nor publicly acknowledged their 
acceptance.
Many have commented on the 
similarities between the study 
abroad subpoenas and the stu
dent loan investigation initiated 
by Cuomo last spring.
The same pattern of Cuomos actions was followed in 
the student loan scandal. The 
investigation began with outside 
providers, then continued with 
the colleges and universities 
themselves a few months later.
Cuomo has charged the col
leges and universities with the 
formation of affiliation agree
ments with study abroad 
providers, as he said in last Fri
days press release.
This side of study abroad 
has always existed, said John 
Hooker, professor of business 
ethics and adviser for the in
ternational track at the Tepper 
School of Business. Its just now

This year experienced a 
record-breaking torrent of 
applications as competition 
tightened for colleges and uni
versities nationwide.
According to their admissions 
departments, Harvard Univer
sity, University of Chicago, and 
Northwestern University, among 
others, reported double-digit in
creases in applications for the 
class of 2012.
Harvard experienced the 
largest increase, reporting over 
17,000 applicants, an increase of 
19 percent from last year.
The University of Chicago and 
Amherst College rounded out 
the top three, with application 
increases of 17 percent and 18 
percent, respectively.
According to The New York 
Times, many officials credited 
the increase in applications 
to the increased adoption of
online applications and students 
applying to a larger number of 
universities.
Some officials had predicted 
that the abandonment of early 
admission policies at Harvard, 
Princeton University, and the 
University of Virginia among 
others would calm the college 
frenzy. Yet, judging from this 
years application trends, this 
theory has been proven false.
The college admissions craze 
is expected to reach its peak 
in 2009 when the number of 
graduating high school seniors 
is expected to be 3.2 million, the 
largest the nation has ever seen.
Although Carnegie Mellons 
Office of Admissions has not yet 
offered an application count, 
they reported an increase of 
19.2 percent last year.
Many students conjectured 
on the number of applications 
expected this year.

A new study shows that colleg
es and universities are receiving 
more money than most charities. 
The survey, sponsored by Commonfund, showed a 16.9 percent 
increase in the average college 
endowment last year.
Commonfund is a non-profit 
organization that invests money 
for colleges and other groups. 
Its Educational Endowment Re
port surveyed 767 colleges and 
universities and found last years 
increase in endowments to exceed 
even the 10.9 percent increase re
corded in 2006.
Most colleges decide how the. 
endowment money is utilized 
based on the returns from several 
years.
According to the study, both 
three- and five-year returns on 
investments made from endow
ments increased from 12.3 percent 
to 12.8 percent and 6.8 percent to
11.5 percent respectively.
Yale and Harvard universities 
possess the largest endow
ments $34.9 billion and $22.5 
billion respectively, and are 
using their investments to help 
reduce tuition costs. After Har
vard decreased tuition fees, Yale 
soon followed, increasing finan
cial aid by as much as 50 percent 
for families with financial need.
Many students were pleased by 
Yales and Harvards tuition re
ductions and some students hope 
Carnegie Mellon will similarly re
duce its tuition.
We pay an incredible amount 
to come to this school and many 
of us will graduate with thou
sands of dollars of debt, said 
Robert Persaud, a first-year H&SS 
student. Maybe these endow
ments can be used to pay for 
some of our tuition, relieving us 
of much of this burden.

MTVs The Real World will 
be celebrating part of its 21st 
birthday in Pittsburgh. Carnegie 
Mellon students have a chance 
to be a part of the celebration, 
which will air on television in 
the next few months. .
On Saturday, Feb. 1, MTV will 
be looking for future roommates 
at Boomerangs Bar and Grille, 
3909 Forbes Ave., for the shows
upcoming 21st season.
We came to Pittsburgh be
cause we came there a few years 
ago and had a great turnout, 
said the shows casting director, 
Damon Furberg.
With no members of the next 
cast decided as of today, seven 
spots remain open to live in the 
Real World house for a total of 
five months.
Lydia Remington, a sophomore 
public policy and management 
major, was excited by the news.
This is so exciting for Pitts
burgh, she said. Im glad they 
are coming here to cast. I would 
love for someone I know to get 
on the show.
Furberg hopes to see some 
college students turn out for the 
casting call, especially since the 
target demographic for a room
mate is ages 18 to 24.
Were doing two seasons a 
year now, Furberg said. So we 
have started casting earlier and 
earlier.
The 20th season just finished 
filming in Hollywood, Calif, 
three weeks ago, and the project 
and location of the next season 
have not yet been determined. 
We usually decide the specifics 
pretty close to the determination 
of the final cast, Furberg said.
While Furberg maintained 
that for a show on its 21st season, 
the formula rarely changes, this

Volunteer work, though done 
for others, is about to take the 
spotlight for itself this week. To
day is the start of campus-wide 
Service Week, a service festi
val implemented by the Service 
Advisory Council in hopes of 
publicizing service opportuni
ties for all students.
A service week was held last 
year, but it received a disap
pointing turnout, according to 
the Office of Student Life.
It wasnt as successful as 
hoped due to a lack of publicity, 
said Monica Bebie, coordinator 
of Greek life and of community 
service initiatives on campus.
Bebie hopes to better publicize 
this years events.
Several months of planning 
and the combined efforts of about 
a dozen service groups have re
sulted in a well structured week 
which will begin with a service 
organization fair today.
Lindsay Liu, a sophomore bi
ology major and president of 
the Carnegie United Toward 
Increased Effort in Service 
(CUTIES) spoke excitedly about 
todays fair.
Students visiting the fair 
will receive imitation passports 
which, when filled with stamps 
from the different organiza
tions, can be traded in for free 
prizes including candy, reusable 
shopping bags, and thermoses, 
she said.
This evening, keynote speaker 
Robert Egger, the founder and 
president of DC Central Kitchen, 
will speak about his experiences 
and the impact which service 
has had on his life and the lives 
of others.
Liu said that CUTIES willSee SERVICE, page A4
sponsor an event later in the 
week at which they will host a 
group of inner city, at-risk kids 
[who are] typically under the 
poverty line and in need of sup
portive mentors.
CUTIES will try to fulfill this 
need through a variety of ac
tivities held on Thursday at the 
University Center. Other groups, 
such as Circle K and East End 
Youth tutoring, are also attempt
ing to improve the lives of young 
children by creating Valentines 
Day cards for elementary school 
students in Pittsburgh.
Additional events include 
a blood drive sponsored by Pi 
Kappa Alpha, a raffle held by 
Strong Women Strong Girls, an 
international silent auction held 
by Students in Free Enterprise 
(SIFE), and the construction 
and painting of picnic tables un
der the guidance of Alpha Phi 
Omega.
According to Sharon Wong, a 
junior CS major and member of 
Alpha Phi Omega, the organiza
tion saw a need for the tables 
and realized that they provided 
a chance to do something for the 
community.
Service in the environmental 
sector will be promoted by Fo
cus the Nation, a nationwide or
ganization working to increase 
awareness of global warming 
and potential'solutions.
This Wednesday, a national 
webcast titled 2% Solution 
will be held on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus about the mer
its and feasibility of these 
solutions. Panelists speaking 
in the webcast include Hunter 
Lovins, CEO of Natural Capital
ism, and Van Jones, executive 
clirector of the Ella Baker Center

Engineer gets national honor
On Feb. 16, Carnegie Mellon doc
toral student Arielle Drummond will be 
granted the 2008 Black Engineer of the 
Year Award for Student Leadership.
The celebration will take place dur
ing the National Black Engineer of the 
Year Awards Global Competitiveness 
Conference in Baltimore, from Feb. 13 to 
17 of this year. The conference has been 
serving as a helpful instrument to dis
tinguish outstanding accomplishments 
of African-Americans in companies and 
academic institutions since 1986.
As an African-American, Drummond 
is one of few minority engineers in the 
field. African-American engineers make 
up 36,000, or 2.6 percent, of the 1.4 mil
lion working engineers in the U.S., or 12 
percent of the overall engineering popu
lation, according to the National Society 
of Black Engineers.
A young teacher from her private
school in New Jersey originally influ
enced Drummond toward physics and 
biology.After graduating from the 
University of North Carolina in Chapel 
Hill, Drummond came to Carnegie 
Mellon, where she currently works with 
researchers on the development of a pe
diatric heart pump.
In 2005, Drummond helped plan 
some of the graduate student events 
at the 32nd annual NSBE conference, 
which was held at Pittsburghs David L. 
Lawrence Convention Center.
Drummond was pleased to receive the 
recognition.
This award reflects the growth and 
maturity I have gained during my time 
here at Carnegie Mellon, she said.

According to a new survey, colleges 
and universities are surpassing other 
organizations in endowed funding.
College applicants reach all-time high
APPLICATION, fromAl
The numbej of pre-college stu
dents interested in taking classes 
at CMU during high school has 
increased quite a bit over the last 
few years, said Anna Goddard, 
a sophomore ethics, history, and 
public policy major.
As a student ambassador and 
Carnegie Mellon pre-college 
counselor, Goddard gives tours 
to prospective students and inter
acts with them on campus.
Goddard noted that although 
computer science remains a pop
ular choice, the artistic depart
ments have received great atten
tion.
I know girls who would kill
to get into the drama program, 
especially musical theater, God
dard said.
There are many student 
opinions as' to why so many pro
spective students are considering 
Carnegie Mellon.
I think that we definitely 
draw from a certain population. 
All of our prospective students 
are passionate about something, 
whether its acting or computers, 
said Tom Lewkowitz, a sopho
more computer science major 
and Carnegie Mellon pre-college 
counselor this past summer.
Lewkowitz also brought up 
college rankings and the press as 
having an influence on students 
and their families when choosing
which colleges to attend.
People cant help but notice re
ports in the media and [the] U.S. 
News rankings that consistently 
place our univefsity in the top 25 
schools in the nation, Lewkowitz 
said.
Some students expressed con
cern at Carnegie Mellons social 
reputation.
CMUs reputation for having 
a nerd/ and somewhat over
stressed student population has 
some influence over applicants, 
Goddard said.
Alexa Beaver, a sophomore 
ChemE and Hispanic studies dou
ble major, agreed.
I feel like, as a school, we need 
to make sure students know that
we are both a great school aca
demically and a place where kids 
like to have fun, Beaver said.
However, if trends are in
dicative of the future, these 
record-breaking figures could be 
broken in the very near future. 
For now, however, competition 
for a spot in Carnegie Mellon will 
remain stiff.
The continued substantial 
increase in applications is an in
dicator of the University's strong 
reputation, said President Jared 
Cohon. We have no plans to in
crease the undergraduate student 
body.
MONEY, fr.om.A4
variety of projects, from building 
maintenance and new facilities 
to the daily operation of a col
lege campus.
Jarrett Adams, a first-year in
formation systems major, agreed 
with Persaud about the oppor
tunities available with a larger 
endowment.
More endowments can mean 
more opportunities for students, 
whether it be for financial aid or 
new equipment for sports and 
activities, Adams said. These 
endowments are a great sign for 
us students and hopefully this 
trend will continue.
However, while rising en
dowments are a good sign for 
colleges, many universities, in
cluding Carnegie Mellon, are 
still dependent on tuition dollars 
and smaller donations as part 
of the operating budget for the 
university.
In 2003, the total operating 
revenue of the university was 
$577 million, $41.7 million of 
which was from endowment 
funds. In 2004, tuition and fees 
made up 34 percent of the bud
get, according to the Carnegie 
Mellon Factbook. Tuition makes 
up a substantially smaller por
tion of Harvard and Yales bud
gets, according to their fact 
books.
Yet only a certain portion of 
a colleges endowment can be 
used and invested each year. The 
endowment itself is comprised 
of money-endowed funds, with 
their purposes decided by the 
donors.
These endowment funds limit 
the amout of money colleges can 
spend, but the U.S. Senate Fi
nance Committee  inspired by 
the rising endowments  aims 
to limit the money colleges can 
avoid spending.
The committee is proposing a 
law that would require colleges 
to spend a minimum of 5 percent 
of their endowments on finan
cial aid.
Despite such strong reactions, 
some experts remain skeptical of 
the increasing trend.
Gordon Weinberg, a professor 
of statistics, questions the recent 
pattern as an indicator of the fu
ture.
Does this reflect a change in 
giving or investment practices? 
Weinberg asked. He also men
tioned changes in government 
regulations such as interest rates 
as possible explanations.
Weinberg believes that these 
endowments may just be a 
reflection of the favorable eco
nomic state.
As larger institutions like 
colleges, arts organizations, 
and hospitals see record in
creases in charitable funding, 
social-service groups are seeing 
a decline in funding  support
ing Weinbergs theory.
According to Inside Higher 
Ed, declining tax revenue in 
many states, including Arizona, 
Michigan, and Minnesota, have 
prompted a decrease in state 
grants to social-service organi
zations.
Additionally, the rising costs 
of gas, food, and other necessi
ties have prompted many more 
middle-class families to look to 
charity for aid. The combina
tion of such actions on charities 
has only negatively effected the 
money they have to spend.
While charities are suffering 
financially, colleges continue to 
soar with their endowments.

students and directed by Jordan Rosenfeld, a sophomore English major, the show featured a group of Carnegie Mellon floormates. Each character had their own dramas, from drug addicton to relationship troubles to friendship problems. The play 
ends dramatically when one student stabs his own best friend to avoid being questioned by the police.

that the issue is coming out into 
the public.
One example of such an 
agreement is the relationship 
between the American Institute 
of Foreign Study and the Univer
sity of Mary Washington.
According to a copy of the 
agreement obtained by. the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mary 
Washington officials receive free 
trips to one its overseas sites and 
a five-percent share for every 15 
students who sign up for the In
stitute program. If fewer than 15 
sign up, the payback is reduced 
to a two-percent share.
According to the Institutes 
website, it also has relationships 
with other universities nation
wide, including the University of 
California at Berkeley, Fordham 
University, Pace University, and 
Rice University.
These arrangements are very 
lucrative to the organization ar
ranging the study abroad, said 
Dale Hershey, a law professor 
in the Tepper School of Busi
ness, but harmful to students, 
raising the costs of the program 
and denying recognition of some 
study abroad [programs] as 
qualifying for a degree.
There are mixed opinions as to 
how this type of behavior should 
be monitored.
I see instances such as this as 
evidence that, while markets do 
a good job of generallyallocating 
resources, they still need rules to 
ensure a level playing field, said 
Stephen Spear, professor of eco
nomics at the Tepper School of 
Business.
Hooker believes that the re
sponsibility lies completely 
within a university. Universities 
are their own guardians of integ
rity and should not need outside 
moderation, said Hooker.
Hooker also addressed the 
reasons behind the need for 
universities to operate so exten
sively with outside programs. 
For many universities, hav
ing a large number or students 
studying abroad is something 
impressive to put on their web
site or in their pamphlets, he
said, especially for large state 
universities.
For smaller and private uni
versities, Hooker brought up the 
often large price differential be
tween home school and outside 
programs. While a semester at 
Carnegie Mellon can cost roughly 
$25,000, a semester abroad 
can cost as little as $10,000, ac
cording to Hooker. Because the 
home school programs are often 
more expensive than outside 
providers, many students choose 
third-party programs.
The Office of International 
Education at Carnegie Mellon of
fers students the chance to meet 
with an adviser specializing 
in their individualized schools 
of study, as well as the chance 
to look in the study abroad li
brary, a large shelf of pamphlets 
for nearly every place of study on 
the globe.
Because of the role of our Of
fice of International Education 
in offering options, not just tell
ing people where to go, I dont 
see this as a problem with our 
students, said Hooker. Yet, despite its lack of relevance to our 
school, the issue has become a 
popular topic for the press and 
study abroad officials nation
wide.
The Association of Interna
tional Educators issued a report 
prepared by the organizations 
special task force charged with 
reviewing the industry.
The report recommended that 
institutions be able to clearly 
define and explain their poli
cies with regard to outside study 
abroad providers. It offered 
advice, but not as to how the 
situation should be monitored or 
what to do about schools that do 
not improve their practices.
The report was prepared 
in direct response to Cuomos 
investigation.
Hooker expressed hope that, 
despite controversy, more 
students will continue to go 
abroad.
There arent enough students 
that do it here, said Hooker, 
and the experience is tfuly 
something amazing.

Bone marrow aids

Researchers claim that inject

can reduce the need for immune

Doctors at the Massachusetts

Medical School tested this 
technique on five patients who 
received kidneys from relatives. 
Four out of five of the patients 
successfully lessened their intake 
of immune suppressant drugs.
The injected bone marrow cells 
prevent the patients body from 
rejecting the transplanted organ. 
This discovery shows the poten

Genetics cause 
stunted growth
A peculiar condition that stubs 
the growth of the body and brain, 
while maintaining average intel
ligence, is likely to have been 
caused by gene mutation, scien
tists suggest.
The gene codes for the protein 
pericentrin, which helps disinte
grate chromosomes during cell 
division.
Scientists at the Rauch of the 
Institute for Human Genetics 
at the University of Erlangen in 
Germany believe that a muta
tion in this protein prevents cell 
division from occurring normally 
and results in stunted growth.
While this condition can be used 
to explain the Hobbit-like people 
who lived nearly 18,000 years 
ago on an island in Indonesia, it 
is seen in modern-day humans as 
well. People with the mutation 
grow about three feet tall and 
have a brain the size of a babys. 
However, their intelligence levels 
are left unaffected.

The simulation of this

How Things Work: Fainting Goats
Sheila Prakash
A goat on Donna Hatchers farm in 
Center Hill, Fla., is quietly grazing, 
when a man approaches the fence and 
makes a loud noise. The startled goat 
turns, runs, and in a display that is at 
once hilarious and alarming, collapses. 
Ten seconds later, the once unconscious 
goat shakes its head, lifts itself up, and 
resumes its business  unfazed, unhurt 
and, apparently, none the worse.
Theyve been called stiff-legged goats, 
Tennessee goats, wooden-leg goats, and 
nervous goats. But this peculiar breed 
of C. aegagrus hircus is most commonly 
known as the fainting goat, after its fidg
ety tendency to scamper and collapse 
when startled. Videos of fainting goats
Check out the 
fainting goats

thetartan.org.
have been circulating 
the Internet en masse, 
causing widespread 
frenzy over a breed that 
already enjoys a loyal 
fan base.
The International Fainting Goat As
sociation (IFGA) has existed since 1989 
and works steadfastly to preserve faint
ing goats and educate the world about 
their uniqueness. Marshall County, 
Tenn., hosts a Fainting Goat Festival ev
ery October.
Fainting goats are affected by a 
congenital condition called myotonia 
congenita, or Thompsons disease, which 
causes the goats muscles to tense up 
and stiffen when startled. The stiffness 
causes the goat to buckle and collapse 
in a display that resembles fainting,
but without pain or loss of 
consciousness. Goats affected 
with hereditary myotonia con
genita are clinically termed 
myotonic goats.
In normal, non-myotonic 
animals, a perceived threat such as 
a loud noise incites a flight or fight 
response in the brain. Electrical signals 
in the brain are then deployed to various 
parts of the body, causing a temporary 
tensing, or stiffening, of the muscles. A 
similar process occurs in humans.
In most cases, the muscles relax al
most immediately afterward, giving 
the body freedom to fight or flee from 
the perceived threat. In myotonic goats, 
this tensing of the muscles is not as 
temporary, but is drawn out for 10 to 20 
seconds.
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
The feeling can perhaps best be un
derstood by remembering the last time 
someone sneaked up and startled you. 
Myotonia congenita draws out this sen
sation for half a minute.
Despite their peculiarities (or perhaps 
because of them), breeders across the 
country have fallen in love with fainting 
goats.
Hatcher owns the Bedrock Fainters, a herd of fainting goats kept on a 
20-acre farm in central Florida. On the 
news program A Current Affair, Donna 
Hatcher discussed the goats and why 
they faint.
They get stiff. It only lasts a few sec
onds, and it doesnt hurt them at all, 
she said. Theyre very intelligent. I like 
these goats better than any other breed 
Ive ever had. Indeed, Floridas Bedrock
Meadow boasts an impressive display of 
fainting goats, from Blue-Eyed Fainter 
Does to Tennessee Silky Fainting Goats.
Myotonia congenita is a condition 
that would wipe out goats in the wild 
because the animals rely on their speed 
and agility to escape predation. When 
the rest of the herd takes off, myotonic 
goats will stiffen and collapse, giving 
their predator an easy target. Prudent 
breeders have protected fainting 
goats from extinction through careful 
and selective breeding, allowing the 
population to become enormously suc
cessful. Aside from their entertainment 
value, myotonic goats serve no particu
lar advantage to breeders.
This process of deliberately select
ing the biologically weaker animal 
is known as unnatural selection. The 
breeds lineage can be traced all the way 
back to 1880s, when a Tennessee farmer 
named John Tinsley purchased goats 
with myotonia congenita from Canada. 
There the goats were carefully bred by 
a local doctor and are still flourishing in 
numbers today.
Concerns have been raised about 
whether it is ethical to selectively 
breed animals with medical conditions, 
especially when its largely for entertain
ment. But breeders and goat-lovers alike 
are quick to point out that the fainting is 
painless, making animal cruelty a non
issue. PETA hedges on the issue. The 
Humane Society shrugs its shoulders, es
pecially in light of the greater atrocities 
that befall animals in the meatpacking 
industries. The Humane Society also 
notes that fainting goats, due to their 
amusement factor and hugely loyal fan 
base, probably enjoy a better quality of 
life than most goats.
Though fainting goats are by far the 
most popular sufferers of myotonia con
genita, the condition can be found in a 
wide range of animals, including hu
mans. This could imply the existence 
of fainting flamingos, fainting giraffes, 
and even fainting cockroaches  a wel
come possibility that certainly warrants 
further investigation.
Bielak studies the 
potential impact 
of earthquaKes
EARTHQUAKE, fromA5
The importance of 
incorporating structures and the 
non-linearity of the soil is that 
it changes the original ground 
motion that would be obtained 
without their presence.
This would eventually help us 
to a more real assessment of what 
the potential impact of a moder
ate or large earthquake could 
have in an earthquake-prone 
region such as southern Califor
nia and the greater Los Angeles 
(basin) area, Taborda stated in 
an e-mail.
Such a realistic estimation 
will enable civil engineers and 
seismologists to make more 
informed decisions about 
necessary precautions prior to 
natural disasters such as earth
quakes.
According to the Carnegie 
Mellon press release, the re
searchers will also join forces 
with the Pittsburgh Supercom
puting Center to apply some 
of the specific algorithms and 
simulation structures to get 
an exact idea of the measures 
needed to be taken to insure 
public safety throughout an 
earthquake.
By planning ahead, Bielak and 
his team of researchers and sci
entists may emerge successful 
in reducing much of the destruc
tion that occurs during a natural 
catastrophe.

caused when the bacteria grow 
in an area in which there is little 
or no oxygen. Symptoms include 
sudden onset of high fever, vom
iting, diarrhea, and muscle aches, 
followed by low blood pressure, 
which can be fatal.
Certain groups are more sus
ceptible or will have a more 
severe reaction to staph infec
tions. Breastfeeding v^omen can
get mastitis (inflammation of 
the breast) from staph bacteria 
as well as abscess of the breast, 
which releases bacteria into the 
mothers milk. The latter condi
tion puts newborn infants at an 
elevated risk of staph infections.
People with lung disease run 
the risk of acquiring Staphylo
coccus pneumonia, which can 
cause abscesses to develop in the 
lungs.
Other groups that are
particularly susceptible to staph 
infections include injecting drug 
users and those with weakened 
immune systems, diabetes,
cancer, lung disease, vascular 
disease, intravenous catheters, 
surgical incisions, or skin inju
ries or disorders.
Minor skin infections are 
treated with over-the-counter 
medication, while more serious 
infections are treated with in
travenous antibiotics. Penicillin 
was once used to treat staph in
fections, but about 50 percent of 
current staph cases are resistant 
to this drug, due to the regu
lar use of antibiotics in the past 
several decades. Now, doctors 
prescribe stronger antibiotics to 
cure staph infections.
The specific antibiotic pre
scribed depends on the type of 
?
infection present. One strain of 
Staphylococcus bacteria, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus, is resistant to antibiotic 
treatment.
The best way to prevent a staph 
infection is to keep skin dry. If 
you do get a cut or injury that re
sults in an open wound, clean the 
area with soap and water. Once 
the cut is clean, apply antiseptic 
ointment to keep bacteria from 
collecting in the affected area. 
If the area becomes increasingly 
painful or red, schedule an ap
pointment with a doctor.
It should be noted that staph 
infections are contagious when 
infected wounds are left weep
ing or uncovered. To protect 
yourself from catching a staph 
infection, avoid sharing tow
els or other personal items, and 
keep your feet covered in locker 
rooms, pool decks, and other 
areas where people tend to go 
barefoot.
So, while its nice to offer a 
towel to a jittery friend at the pool 
or frolic shoe-free in the locker 
room, be careful with whom you 
share and who shares with you
 you may also be sharing with 
some uninvited Staphylococcus 
bacteria.

Pa. schools need creativity and funding, not testing
On Thursday, Jan. 12, the Pennsylva
nia State Board of Education approved 
a plan requiring all high school stu
dents to pass a series of course-specific 
tests in English, math, science, and so
cial studies in order to graduate. This 
plan is rooted heavily in the theories of 
standards-based education reform, a 
key part of the infamous No Child Left 
Behind Act (NCLBA).
Following the chance, students would 
have multiple opportunities to pass the 
tests, and those who have difficulty 
passing the tests would qualify for extra 
tutoringyet, no one in the state seems 
to know where the funding for that extra 
tutoring would come from. Many schools 
cant muster up the money for standard 
tutoring, let alone additional tutoring 
specific to these tests. There is already 
an ongoing funding problem in Pennsyl
vania in which low-income schools cant 
afford to adequately teach students, and 
therefore receive less funding. As it is, 
public schools in the state are $4.3 bil
lion short of the money needed to ensure 
a quality education.
A common argument against NCLBA 
is applicable here, too. In preparation 
for the Pennsylvania System of School 
Assessment tests, many schools set aside 
hours  some even set aside entire 
school days  teaching students how to 
take the tests. Akin to the tutoring ex
ample, time and money are being taken 
away from the basics of a good school
ing. Not only does this hurt kids who 
achieve beyond the level of the tests, it 
also hurts kids who cant even get tutor
ing for their normal school work.
Currently, the Pennsylvania State 
Board of Education requires all students
to complete a graduation project in order 
to get a diploma. Students choose their 
own projects, which require some ele
ment of service. This is a requirement that 
makes sense: The project doesnt have to 
cost any money, it doesnt take any time 
out of the schooling process, and it allows 
kids to focus on something they enjoy. 
While standardized tests work to bring 
everyone to an average, for better or for 
worse, the graduation project has the 
potential to allow students to cultivate 
their interests and talents, explore their 
passions, and discover that there can be 
something more to schooling than square 
roots and predicate nominatives.
A little bit of creativity can go a long 
way in improving education, but in the 
end, it all seems to point to one thing: 
What schools really need is more fund
ing, not more tests.
Roe v. Wade anniversary raises new issues
Last Tuesday marked the 35th anni
versary of Roe v. Wade, a landmark trial 
wherein the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 
that a womans right to have an abortion 
was protected under the Constitution. 
Both pro-life and pro-choice demon
strators rallied in Washington, D.C. in 
recognition of the trials anniversary. 
The rallies  along with the continually 
publicized opinions of politicians and 
citizens alike  make it clear that abor
tion is still a hotly contested topic.
Regardless of an individuals beliefs, 
it is undeniable that Roe v. Wade made a 
profound impact on legislation and con
tinues to shape legal decisions today It is 
still important to be informed about Roe 
v. Wade and other significant abortion 
trials to understand how the issue has 
evolved in recent decades. Regardless 
of an individuals beliefs, it is undeni
able that Roe v. Wade made a profound 
impact on legislation and continues to 
shape legal decisions today
As reported in a Jan. 17 article of The 
Chicago Tribune, abortion rates in the 
country are as low as they have been 
since 1974, the year after Roe v. Wade 
made the procedure legal. Many attri
bute the decline in abortion to legislation 
that stands in the way of women seeking 
abortions, mandating parental consent 
forms and waiting periods, along with 
the newly upheld Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act of 2003, criminalizing secondtrimester abortion.
Although the abortion rate is at a low, 
the U.S. has the highest rate of unin
tended pregnancy among developed 
countries, reports the Tribune. It is hard 
not to blame the countrys high rate of 
unintended pregnancy on lacking sex
education; the public school systems ab
stinence-only curriculum does not teach 
students about contraceptives.
Another evolving aspect of the issue 
is the growing voice of men whose part
ners have had abortions. Many report 
depression, grief, and other traumatic 
symptoms as the extended aftermath 
of an abortion, lasting for months or 
even years. Doctors began to identify 
post-abortion syndrome in women in 
the 1980s, and now many are recogniz
ing men with similar conditions.
Its important for men affected by 
abortion to share their stories, in part to 
draw attention to a previously unknown 
dimension of the debate. Moreover, sto
ries of personal impact help overturn 
the stereotype that abortion  and 
pregnancy  are burdens for women to 
suffer alone.
Whole Foods saves plastic, the environment
Australia did it. Bangladesh did it. 
China is in the process of doing it. Not 
that wed jump off a bridge if they did 
it too, but they may be on to something
 more specifically, getting greener by 
eliminating plastic bags from their su
permarkets.
The Whole Foods Market chain has 
caught on. Starting Apr. 22, the specialty 
market will ban plastic bags from all 270 
of its stores nationwide, eliminating the 
estimated 150 million plastic bags that 
the company distributes each year.
Stores in a host of other countries, in
cluding Ireland, France, Germany, England, 
and South Africa, as well the city of San
Francisco and all Ikea stores nationwide, 
charge customers a fee for each plastic 
bag they use at check-out, in hopes of 
curbing excessive bag use and encour
age patrons to bring reusable bags when 
they shop. Whole Foods had a better 
idea  instead of charging customers 
money for plastic bags, why not save both 
companies and consumers moneyand 
the environment  by eliminating them 
all together?
To some, Whole Foods decision may 
look like a tactic aimed at getting shop
pers to purchase reusable canvas bags, 
which they sell in their stores. However, 
Whole Foods is continuing to offer the
standard free paper bags, which are 
made from recycled paper. Therefore, 
the company is still offering customers 
freedom of choice and providing a free 
alternative in the absence of plastic bags, 
while doing a service to the environment.
We applaud Whole Foods for 
implementing a pollution solution 
that benefits the company, its custom
ers, and the environment. With local 
supermarket chains like Giant Eagle 
following suit and offering reusable 
bags for purchase in all of its stores, in 
addition to the already-available plastic 
bags, we hope that Paper or plastic? 
will become a question of the past.
Writers strike will bring 
fresher, darker entertainment
CYNTHIA PENG
On Jan. 7, ABC aired its last taped epi
sode of Desperate Housewives. Like all 
great season finales, it ended on a cliffhanger: Katherine Mayfair, in a typical 
Housewives move, rips up and tosses a 
note into the fire, desperate to keep its 
dark contents secret, only to have her 
daughter, Dylan, piece the half-burned 
remnants back together. Dylans face 
then transforms into a confused contor
tion of some unexplained emotion as 
she reads the message that supposedly 
explains her past. Is the look fear? Is it 
bewilderment? What is the secret on 
the note?
We dont know. And, because of the 
ongoing writers strike, we wont find out 
for a while. But when TV returns, enter
tainment writing  and the general 
American publicwill be permanently 
changed, perhaps for the better.
American society is experiencing un
rest due to the strike of the Writers Guild 
of America (WGA), which began in 
early November. I can feel the tension; 
the crisis of not airing new episodes on 
major networks is felt more acutely than 
the confusion of undecided primary vot
ers or even the Carnegie Mellon stress 
level. We no longer have that prized hour 
each week when we excitedly subject 
ourselves to mindless entertainment.
As enterprising Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, weve begun to take initiative. We 
brought back movies from home and 
six-disc seasons of television shows of 
yore, like Greys Anatomy and Heroes, 
to combat the nostalgia for those longlost days of true TV entertainment.
Some of us even watched the presiden
tial debates and the news to attempt 
to heal the hole in our hearts. And yet, 
we pined. America isnt America with
out American entertainment. Who are 
these writers and what do they want, 
anyway  and when do we get our TV 
back?
The WGA, East, and the WGA, West, 
are labor unions representing 12,000 
film, radio, and television writers. Their 
demand is for compensation for the re
siduals of the industry, which includes 
online episodes and DVD sales. Residu
als in the writing industry help writers in 
times of unemployment, which is com
mon, acting as a minor stabilizing factor 
in an otherwise unstable profession.
The nature of being a writer entails a 
certain amount of risk and instability. 
The romanticized anguish and strife so 
present in classic literature of the past 
could not have come about if authors 
lived lives of five-star hotels and moun
tains of cash. Thus is the essence of 
great literature: Writers anger at soci
ety for their own tortured souls pro
duces more great literature, once they 
are out of their emo slump. This strike, 
though hazardous to the average, enter
tainment-dependent American, is good 
for the future of the art of putting pen to 
paper. Once were out of this minor depres
sion, TV should be better (and darker) 
than ever. Its delayed gratification.
I know now that Dylans were eyes of 
fear, for the note said, This is the last 
episode. After this, everyone will be 
subjected to a dark force far worse than 
no TV... reality TV. She had reason to 
be scared.

Odyssey seeks diverse, academically strong students
Thanks to The Tartan for its attention 
to the Odyssey program in both a fea
ture article, Students make way up to 
the Summit and an editorial, Odyssey 
should look past QPAs on Jan. 21.
However, both the article and edito
rial contain significant errors  most 
likely because the Tartan reporters 
did not solicit information before writ
ing the article from either Indira Nair, 
vice provost for education, or Stephanie 
Wallach, director of Undergraduate Re
search and Fellowship Resources. (Dr. 
Wallach was first contacted by e-mail on 
Friday evening, telling her that an article 
would appear in Mondays Tartan; Dr. 
Wallach asked to speak with the re
porter, which she did, but she was not 
provided an opportunity to substitute 
accurate for erroneous information.)
Here are the key inaccuracies.
1. Odyssey is not a leadership pro
gram (as described in the front page 
article) but, first and foremost, an aca
demic program with defined academic 
tasks and goals. That is why it is orga
nized under the vice provost for edu
cations office. The term leadership 
intentionally was not mentioned in any 
descriptive communications regarding 
the nature of the program.
2. The request for student nomina
tions was widely circulated to various 
campus representatives, including de
partment academic advisors, individual 
faculty members, deans, Student Affairs 
staff, and the athletic department. Seek
ing a wide range of input into the selection 
process is a key goal of the program.
3. A central aim of Odyssey is to en
hance students writing and research 
skills in order to help them become 
stronger candidates for nationally com
petitive scholarships and fellowships, 
such as Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, and
many others. A minimum QPA is a re
quirement to compete for most of these 
opportunities; a QPA of 3.4, as Odyssey 
requires, is actually on the low end for 
these nationally competitive scholar
ships and fellowships.
4. That said, the Odyssey nomination 
letter specifically states that QPA should 
not be the sole criterion to nominate Od
yssey candidates. We want to identify 
academically stellar candidates who are 
also well rounded and display a broad 
range of talents and metacurricular in
terests.
Student Affairs already runs several 
excellent leadership programs on cam
pus, such as Emerging Leaders, Syzygy, 
and GreekEmergingLeaders, inaddition 
to CA and RA training. The athletic de
partment also coordinates a leadership 
series for its athletes. These programs 
are dependent on the recommendations 
of, among others, housefellows, club 
presidents, coaches, and activity advis
ers, as well as faculty. The leadership 
programs on campus provide excep
tional opportunities for students, but 
they have a different mission from Odyssey, 
which is first and foremost an academi
cally oriented program to help develop 
specific writing and research skills.
The Tartan editorial raises important 
issues about the uses and abuses of QPA 
as a gatekeeper. Both Dr. Indira Nair and 
Dr. Wallach welcome further discussion 
with Tartan reporters and editorial writ
ers about the design, implementation, 
and future of the Odyssey program.

THETARTAN.ORG/FORUM THE TARTAN JANUARY 28, 2008
Representing 
our generation 
in Election 2008
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hey Tartans. Today, I decided 
that instead of an update, I would 
offer ail actual perspective, as 
the title of this section suggests.
Over break, illness and the 
lack of a car relegated me to stay
ing home and making the most 
of the three bedrooms and bath
rooms around me. This resulted 
in a lot of TV, meaning a rigor
ous, 10-hour schedule of CNN 
and Fox News election coverage. 
Because of this, Ive developed 
conspiracy theories about candi
dates, and I may or may not have 
charted primary performance 
with several kinds of graphs. Ill 
freely admit that Im kind of lame 
and a bit of a political junkie.
However, what has been par
ticularly inspiring is that, since 
coming back to campus, Ive 
found that a number of people 
around me have been paying at
tention to the election coverage 
as well. Its pretty awesome to be 
walking down the street and see
ing a couple coming back from a 
dinner date discussing the differ
ences in Obamas and Romneys 
economic plans.
As you all probably know, our 
age group has been disregarded 
as an apathetic part of the Ameri
can population in the past. Whats 
so interesting this time around is 
the amount of attention our gen
eration is paying, and not in the 
fake MTV, Rock the Vote/Vote 
or Die at the hand of Puff 
Daddy/Puffy/P. Diddy and JayZ/Sean/S. Carter way, but in the 
critical, debate-watching way.
I would like this to continue. In 
my eyes, voting without knowl
edge of the candidates and issues 
is an irresponsible thing to do. 
Instead, real information should 
inspire a decision. We are the 
best and brightest in the coun
try, and we pride ourselves on 
that. Lets get the information, 
and lets make decisions. This 
has been called the most impor
tant election in history. I believe 
it will be; and it looks as though, 
this time around, the rest of our 
generation agrees.
If you have any input, feel free 
to e-mail me at cmil5@cmu.edu, 
as always.

Sex for attention: The lasting effects of Never Have I Ever
SARAH MOGIN
When I was 15,1 decided on a 
whim to go to an all-girls sleepaway camp in the Adirondacks. 
Though open to young ladies from 
all over the country, the vast major
ity of campers came from New 
York and Connecticut, with a 
smattering of Jersey girls to boot.
Now Ive never studied abroad 
in any European hostel  but 
trust me  I know a culture shock 
when I see one.
Within hours of my arrival, my 
posh Maryland upbringing was 
thoroughly de-poshed. The girls 
in my bunk sat me down for the 
first of many makeovers, over
whelming me with tips on hairstraightening, lip-glossing, and 
mascara-applying  techniques I 
didnt master until years later (and 
even now, Im not so hot with the 
mascara). My vocabulary quickly 
expanded to include important 
phrases like Juicy Couture and 
Jimmy Choo, banishing buzz 
words like Old Navy to the depths 
of my temporal lobe.
At night, activities were sparse: 
reading, writing letters to boys, 
standing in line for the phone, 
sending secret text messages (No 
cell phones, ladies!), prepping 
for the SATs, and  of course  
Never Have I Ever.
For those unaware, Never 
Have I Ever is a sleepover-type 
game meant to elucidate (and 
perhaps celebrate) the loss of 
innocence. Players begin by hold
ing out their hands so that 10 
fingers are showing. Each player 
takes turns saying something 
theyve never done (kissed a boy, 
smoked a cigarette, cheated on a 
geometry exam) and anyone who 
has done it has to put down a finger.
At the end of the game, the 
player with the most fingers 
down is the most experienced, 
coolest, sluttiest, whatever. And the 
player with the least? That was me.
I hadnt tasted alcohol, snuck 
out of the house, smoked... 
anything, or had sex. I was still 
stranded on what the athletically 
inclined might call second base 
and even that was kind of a fluke, 
a pop fly, a fumble, if you will.
Now, its been five years since I 
bid farewell that fateful camp, but 
strangelyFve never quite been 
able to leave that bunk behind.
As I progressed through high 
school, I did what most late 
bloomers do: I bloomed. Late. 
My head slowly wrapped its way 
around the concept of sexuality, 
of breasts, hips, etc., and I learned 
to talk to boys without vomiting 
or running away screaming.
But every time I hit another 
milestone  the three-times-23,
the sacred handing over of the 
v-card  there was something off 
about the way I felt. Somewhere 
within my brains sequestered cat
acombs, a 15-year-old Sarah was 
running back to the bunk, ready 
to hop in on the game and put 
down another finger.
And if the things I felt were strange, 
the things I said were downright 
ridiculous. I wanted to talk about 
sex. I wanted people to know Id 
had sex. Mosdy, I wanted people 
to know that my perky, virginal 
exterior was at least somewhat
misleading. As if, maybe from 
some interstate version of Broken 
Telephone, word would get through 
to those girls from my bunk.
Luckily though, high schools 
over, and Ive gotten slightly bet
ter at controlling my actions and 
words. Maybe all of my strange 
inclinations can be traced back to 
a few bad rounds of Never Ever
Have I Ever, but I doubt it.
The problem is, I see plenty of 
people  girls and boys  showing 
the same illogical eagerness to have 
and talk about sex, and these people 
werent even at my summer camp.
My suspicion is, for most people, 
theres always a bunk, theres always 
a Never Have I Ever  even if 
its a dance troupe, a boys locker 
room, or a student organization. 
Theres always a group of people, 
past or present, that youre trying 
to impress.
For this, I have one suggestion:
Get over it. I know its easier said 
than done  and its something I 
still struggle with myself  but I 
figure if s worth a shot.
Anytime you consider hav
ing sex for any reason other 
than love or (in certain 
circumstances) lust, reconsider 
your motivations. And anytime 
you consider talking about sex, 
make sure your intended audi
ence is actually in the room  
and not, you know, a memory.
Ive played Never Have I 
Ever plenty of times since that 
summer, and I have (perhaps 
shamefully) wound up putting 
the most fingers down at times. 
Having the least fingers down is 
no picnic, but  let me tell you
 neither is having the most.
From what I can tell, innocence 
and experience both have their 
pros and cons. Theres no point in 
rushing through significant stages 
of your life, but Tm pretty sure 
chastity isnt much better. The 
real winner of Never Have I Ever 
is the player in the middle  the 
one whos found a balance.

Environmental justice: Its not what you think
ANDREW PETERS
I will lay my cards on the table 
now and declare that Im no expert 
on environmental policy; Im not 
even particularly well-versed. I 
have a passing knowledge of eth
anol and biofuels, I know my fair 
share of regional climate change 
partnerships, and, of course, I 
remember from grade school how 
cutting down the rainforest is bad 
news. That being said, I wouldnt 
be able to hold a conversation 
for very long with some of the 
brilliant minds here at Carnegie 
Mellon who bleed green. Still, I 
suspect that the number of people 
who are truly conversant in the 
realm of environmental issues is 
relatively small, putting me on 
par with just about everyone else 
on the planet.
A recent panel discussion 
and forum held in McConomy 
Auditorium during last Mondays 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day cel
ebrations brought together a 
small group of local professionals 
trying to analyze and revitalize 
Pittsburghs neighborhoods 
through the lens of environmental 
justice. In light of their discus
sion, it seems that environmen
tal issues for us  students in 
Pittsburgh, hundreds of miles 
away from any rainforest  are 
more familiar than we might 
have thought. Perhaps our defi
nition of what the environment 
is suffers from outdated, narrow 
definitions.
I think I speak for a lot of 
people when I say that envi
ronment and nature are terms 
that immediately conjure those 
overly simple diagrams depicting 
the ecosystem from third grade, 
with earthworms dowTi in the 
dirt and a sloth and toucan up* 
in the trees. Environmental jus
tice, however, is far broader and, 
maybe not intuitively, posits the 
idea that equal respect should
be given to the poor farmer who 
must cut down the rainforest as is 
given to the rainforest itself.
The environment is, in this 
simple sense, the setting of your 
life. Do you live in the ghetto 
or the suburbs? Is your water 
clean or dirty? Are there toxins 
in your walls and pipes? Do you 
enjoy new and well maintained 
infrastructure? The answers, of 
course, are largely dependent 
upon socio-economic and politi
cal status, which is often (but 
not always, as the panelists were 
quick to point out) a function of 
race and ethnicity.
Thus, environmental justice, 
which often rings annoyingly 
in many ears as a problem 
of crunchy-granola-eating
scientists, is really the conflu
ence of a scientific and a social 
movement. It has roots in biology 
and ecology, yes, but it has equal 
roots in urban studies, racial his
tory, and social policy. With this 
more holistic concept of the envi
ronment in mind, one can ask 
whether enacted policies are just 
with respect to the environment 
that they create or, more simply, 
whether the environment, now 
conceived as an easily manipulated 
social context, is a just one.
To use a rainforest-less example 
from the forum, many wonder if it 
was just to force citizens of the Hill 
district off of their property and 
out of their once-thriving neigh
borhood to make way for Mellon 
Arena. This frequently referenced
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
policy has been on the tips of 
Pittsburgh tongues for years, but 
the question has never been one 
of justice with regard to the citi
zens and their environment, but 
rather of racial tensions and lack 
of political power.
In reality, environmental issues 
and issues of agency and political 
power are two sides of the same 
coin. Lack of political power, 
low numbers of registered vot
ers, and, frankly, discriminatory 
policies, deprive people of agency 
over their environment: They lack 
the ability to make infrastructural 
improvements, keep factories and 
landfills out of their neighbor
hoods, and generally fight against 
poor urban-planning decisions. 
Thus, the environment in poor
neighborhoods becomes dilapi
dated and crime-ridden, posing 
severe health and welfare risks to 
residents.
Environmental injustices are 
not limited to racial minorities. 
Panelists discussed problems in 
Appalachia, where the popula
tion is virtually all white, in 
addition to discussing issues that 
concern all Pittsburgh residents. 
Those who have researched 
Pittsburghs water and sewer 
infrastructure know that the 
citys dirty litde secret, and inci
dentally, one cause of the ubiqui
tous Oakland water-main breaks, 
is that it has a dual-use sewer 
system that handles both runoff 
and waste water in the same 
pipes  pipes that are too old 
and too small. When there is too 
much runoff for the ducts, the 
excess slurry of rain and sewage 
defaults directly into the river. 
I wont expound on the health 
problems associated with raw 
sewage in the rivers any more 
than to say that it poses health 
threats to all flora and fauna in 
the area, not just humans.
Maybe, in this way, we can 
sketch a parallel between a 
more conventional example of 
an environmental problem; say, 
animals perishing because of an 
oil spill in Alaska, and people at 
risk because of the effects of bad 
social policy in the Hill District. 
These issues are both appeals to 
environmental justice, a prin
ciple that extends the familiar 
environmentalist idea that men 
and nature can live in sustain
able harmony to encompass the 
notion that men have by right 
a stake not only their life and 
liberty, but to a healthy envi
ronment; that it is unjust for 
one man to force upon another 
an environment that erodes his 
ability to work, play, and five 
without facing obstacles to his 
well-being.

Mens basketball defeats Case Western
Basketballs record falls to 7-5 overall
BASKETBALL, fromA12
Schilling led the Tartans with 
15 points, and junior forward 
Rachelle Roll pulled down 18 
rebounds, tying her career-high. 
Case Westerns depth proved too 
much for Carnegie Mellon as five 
Spartans scored in double fig
ures in the win. Carnegie Mellon 
shot 36.1 percent from the field 
for the game compared to Cases 
43.3 percent. The Tartans turned 
the ball over 22 times whereas 
Case only committed 13.
The game against Emory on
Sunday stayed close initially 
but the Eagles went on a 13-2 
run to lead the Tartans 22-11 at 
the 9:37 mark in the first half. 
Junior guard Stacie Aleski hit a 
three-pointer to cut the Emory 
lead to 22-16, but Emory pulled 
away from that point and led 
37-21 at halftime.
A pair of baskets from 
Williamson brought the Tartans 
within 11, at 41-30, with 15:56 
remaining in the game but the 
Eagles responded to put the 
game out of reach. The Eagles 
led by as much as 24 points in
the second half, before defeating 
the Tartans by 21.
Senior forward Leah Feola led 
the Tartans in scoring with 13 
points and Schilling contributed 
12 points and a game-high nine 
rebounds. Junior guard Corey 
Innes hit three three-pointers to 
finish with nine points in the 
loss. Carnegie Mellon shot 36.8 
percent from the floor in the 
game and committed 28 turn
overs.
The Tartans host the University

As fiery as Ryan Einwag gets 
during the game, thumping his 
chest after making baskets and 
hollering after hard fouls, hes 
the polar opposite in the locker 
room afterwards. You wont hear 
a peep out of Einwags mouth in 
reference to his personal perfor
mance. Hed rather talk about 
how the Tartans did with defense 
or ran their sets, or, most impor
tantly, what the final score was.
Im just trying to win basket
ball games, said Einwag. I dont 
care much about anything else. I 
want to 'play well, but its more 
important to me that we get the 
win, regardless of how much I 
score. I want to hear about how 
the whole team did.
Einwag was utterly dominat
ing in a road victory against 
league rival Case Western 
Reserve University He torched 
the Spartans for 30 points on 
11-17 shooting, including 3-5 
from beyond the arc. His high 
percentage shooting helped the 
Tartans finish at nearly 51 per
cent for the game enroute to a 
fourteen-point victory, 86-72. 
Einwag also pulled down seven 
rebounds. 
We knew he was going to be 
special since he got here two 
years ago, said senior co-captain Greg Gonzalez. He was as 
talented as he was competitive. 
He reminded most of the upper
classmen of Nate [Maurer]. 
Maurer led the Tartans in scoring
during their University Athletic 
Association (UAA) title run two 
years ago.
While Einwag led all scorers 
with 30 and stole most of the ink, 
Gonzalez compiled career highs 
in two categories. He netted a 
career high 25 points and tied 
his career-high with four blocks. 
Add 12 rebounds to that already 
impressive stat sheet, and youve 
got yet another double-double 
(double-digit numbers in two 
categories) by the 6'8" Texan 
during the 07-08 campaign.
Geoff Kozak added 16 points 
and four assists for the Tartans. 
Jack Anderson returned from 
his ankle injury, coming off the 
bench to log 17 minutes. This 
is what I came back for, said 
Gonzalez, who returned to 
Carnegie Mellon for his fifth year 
after a medical red-shirt kept 
him out of competition last year. 
Everyone really started contrib
uting at a high level [Friday].
Unfortunately, the high level 
couldnt continue into Sunday. 
The Tartans fell to Emory in 
Atlanta on Sunday afternoon by 
four points, letting their record 
slip to 11-5 overall, including 
1-4 in the UAA. It was another 
poor shooting performance, as 
Carnegie Mellon shot 40 per
cent from the field compared to 
Emorys 51 percent shooting.
In a game that saw a grand 
total of 94 free throws attempt
ed, there was no opportunity to 
establish a physical presence for 
either team. There were sections 
of the game in which whistles
were blowing on every posses
sion, stopping play for touch 
fouls and subtle bumps. It left 
much to be desired in terms of 
pace of play, allowing the winner 
of the game to be the team with 
enough men left standing. It 
wasnt about execution as much 
as it was about fundamental foul 
shooting.
Despite solid contributions off 
the bench by junior forward Jon 
Wolleben and first-year Shane 
Rife, who each contributed six 
and nine points, respective
ly, the Tartans couldnt get it 
going down the stretch. Emory 
took a one-point lead off of two 
foul shots from player Spiros 
Ferderigos, with about four min
utes left to play. The Eagles kept 
the lead the rest of the way, hold
ing off Carnegie Mellons surges 
until the final whistle sounded. 
The Eagles defended their home 
court successfully, earning a 
final score of 89-85.
The free throws numbers were 
kind of deceiving, said Kozak, 
who fouled out after leading the 
Tartans with 20 points. Corey 
[ORourke] made a bunch at.the 
end to inflate our percentage. 
With all the fouls that got called 
for both teams, it was more of a 
free-throw shooting contest than 
a game. And you cant win a freethrow shooting contest by shoot
ing 60 percent.
The team host the University 
of Chicago on Friday, Feb. 1 at 
8 p.m. at Skibo Gymnasium, 
directly following the Think 
Pink event.

With a win this past Saturday 
at the Denison University 
Lid-Lifter meet, Carnegie 
Mellon men's track and field 
team is already off to a good 
start from last years confer
ence title victory, winning *10 
out of 15 individual events. 
The Tartan interviewed Joel 
Palko, a veteran team member 
in both jumping and running 
events, on what its like to be 
a student athlete at Carnegie 
Mellon and his thoughts on 
the promising 2008 season.
Tartan: When did you first 
start participating in track and 
field? Any certain inspiration?
Palko: Around the age of 10,
I participated in a local track 
and field club. I would have 
to say my dad kind of pushed 
me into track and field. He is 
a jumping coach at niy former 
high school.
T: What goals do you feel 
the team has for this season?
P: We had a great season 
last year. Everyone on the 
team really picked up thengame for the outdoor season 
and with some big help from 
a few freshmen, we ended up 
winning the conference title. 
We are going to try and repeat 
that championship.
T: Are there any meets that 
you are especially excited for 
this season?
P: I get more excited for the 
outdoor track meets, in par
ticular the conference meet, 
because it is usually one of the 
last meets of the season and 
means the most to the team. 
Washington University has al
ways been one of our bigger
rivals. It feels especially good 
when we defeat them.
T: If you could change some
thing about Carnegie Mellon 
as a student athlete, what 
would it be?
P: More athletic facilities. 
They are all so crowded.
T: Do you feel that partici
pating in a sport has helped 
you manage schoolwork?
P: Participating in a sport 
helps to keep me focused, but I 
would have to say that I lose a 
lot of sleep during the season, 
too. In general I think it has 
helped me keep.good grades.
T: What made did you de
cide to major in ChemE and 
BME?
P: I knew engineering was 
for me because I am a logical 
thinker and had some natu
ral ability at calculus and the 
sciences. I started out as a 
ChemE/BME and just never 
looked back.
T: Are you in any clubs or 
other organizations on cam
pus?
P: I am a member of DOCS 
[Doctors of Carnegie Society] 
and spend a lot of time in
volved with the Best Buddies 
organization here at CMU.
T: If you werent running 
track, is there another sport 
that you would be interested 
in competing in?
P: I played basketball and 
football in highschool as well 
as track, and loved playing all 
three. Basketball is probably 
the next closest to my heart.
T: Do you have any memo
rable or entertaining stories 
since being a Carnegie Mellon 
track team member?
P: Too many good times to 
pick just one, but there have 
been some experiences that I 
would not trade for the world!
I would have to say the mem
ory that will probably stick 
with me the longest will be 
standing up on the podium 
after winning the conference 
meet last spring.
T: What would you like to do 
with your major for a career?
P: I plan on going to medi
cal school after I graduate 
from CMU, so I think the 
problem-solving skills I learned 
as an engineer will help me in 
the future. I havent looked 
into specific schools too closely 
yet. University of Pittsburgh is 
a possibility, as well as some 
schools in North Carolina. I 
like Pitt because of its strength 
in research and the schools in 
North Carolina because they 
are not in Pittsburgh.
Think Pink event Friday
JESSICA HOWARD
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons womens 
basketball team is teaming up 
with the Womens Basketball 
Coaches Association (WBCA) 
and will be holding a Think 
Pink day on Sunday, Feb. 3, 
as they host the Washington 
University Bears at 2 p.m. in 
Skibo Gymnasium.
The team encourages every
one in attendance to wear pink to 
support breast cancer research. 
Donations will be collected at the 
game with all proceeds going to 
the Susan G. Komen for the Cure 
breast cancer foundation.
Komen for the Cure is the 
worlds largest grassroots net
work of breast cancer survivors 
and activists fighting to ensure 
quality care for patients and to 
support cancer research. The 
organization has invested nearly 
$1 billion to fulfill this prom
ise, becoming the worlds largest 
source of nonprofit funds dedi
cated to the fight against breast 
cancer.
The athletic department is 
continually searching for ways 
to get Carnegie Mellon students, 
faculty, and staff involved in
athletic events and community 
affairs. Members of the depart
ment hope that students who 
attend the Think Pink theme 
will attract students to the game, 
encouraging them to make 
donations and increase aware
ness for breast cancer research. 
Many athletes, as well as oth
ers within the community, have 
been affected by the devastat
ing effects of cancer, and the. 
womens basketball team aims 
to bring the community together 
to acknowledge the struggle and 
listen to success stories.
I definitely support the 
WBCA initiative, but as a bas
ketball team, since we dont 
charge any admission, its wise 
for us to do something like this 
to help others out, said Carissa 
Sain, assistant womens basket
ball coach and coordinator of 
the event. CMU students are 
generally lucky and privileged 
individuals, so we should make 
an extra effort to help those in 
need.
The following Friday, Feb. 
8, the Tartans travel to St. 
Louis for a 6 p.m. tipoff. There, 
Washington University will be 
also be holding a Think Pink 
day.

Carnegie Mellons track and 
field team started its new sea
son on a bright note. The mens 
and womens teams traveled to 
Denison University for the indoor 
Lid-Lifter meet in Granville, 
Ohio, where they won 10 events 
out of 15. While the men con
tinued to build on their success 
from last year, the womens team 
saw good performances from 
several newcomers.
On the mens side, first-year 
Chris Luther finished second in 
the 55-meter hurdles with a time 
of 8.28 seconds. Senior Eric Tang 
took first in the 55-meter dash 
(6.73) and junior Craigh Hahn 
placed second in the 200-meter 
dash (24.43).
In the 400-meter dash, sopho
more Chris Bogie and first-year 
Casey Piper took second and 
third with times of 52.89 and 
53.78 seconds, respectively. 
Senior Scott Fortune dominated 
the 800-meter dash with a time 
of 1:59.01, with first-year Dan 
Addis finishing fourth with a 
time of 2:01.58.
The distance runners, how
ever, were the highlight of the 
meet. Led by junior Brian Harvey, 
the mens team saw four runners 
in the top four in the one-mile 
run. Harvey finished first with a 
time of 4:18.17, and junior Breck 
Fresen took second with a time 
of 4:24.82. Senior Drew Miller 
and sophomore Dario Donatelli 
rounded out the top four with 
times of 4:25.27 and 4:33.67. In 
the 3000-meter run, first-year 
J.P. Allera finished first with a 
time of 9:02.84.
It is always interesting to start 
the new semester with track as 
a contrast, because with cross 
country we are such a tight unit, 
Donatelli said. When track 
comes around, [the] cross coun
try runners almost form a team 
within a team.
Tang also finished first in 
the long jump (6.23 meters) 
and triple jump (12.79 meters). 
Junior Joel Palko (5.89 meters) 
and first-year Brad Holden (5.68 
meters) took second and fourth, 
respectively, in the long jump. 
Behind Tang, first-year Essien 
Ohues jumped 12.75 meters for 
second place in the triple jump. 
Ohues also led the team in the 
high jump with 1.86 meters.
Sophomore Chris Bridgeman 
finished first in the pole vaults 
with 4.25 meters. The Tartans 
also dominated the weight 
throws, with senior Mike Reggie 
finishing first at 13.68 meters. 
Sophomore James Hulley 
(13.20 meters) and junior Chris 
Fortunato (11.60 meters) took 
second and third, respective
ly. Hulley (14.32 meters) and 
Fortunato (12.72 meters) also 
took first and third, respectively, 
in the shot put.
The 4x200- and 4x400-meter 
relay A teams both took second 
place with times of 1:38.59 and 
3:35.35, respectively.
For the womens team, sopho
more Diane Mattingly (1:01.98) 
continued to excel in the 
400-meter dash with a first-place 
finish. First-year Courtney Baker 
(1:03.15) and senior Shuan 
Ormon (1:04.22) took third 
and fourth, respectively. In the 
800-meter dash, first-year Laura 
McKee placed first with a time of 
2:29.59. First-years Morgan Faer 
(9.66) and Danielle Fisher (9.88) 
led the team with fourth and 
sixth finishes in the 55-meter 
hurdles. In the 55-meter dash, 
Faer also finished fourth with a
time of 8.33, and junior Emily 
Giacomarra took fifth with a 
time of 8.41.
Personally, I felt I did as well 
as I could have hoped. I was very 
pleased with my times and such, 
especially in my first meet, Faer 
said. I also feel that I have pro
vided a foundation to build on 
for the rest of the season.
Several jumpers finished in 
the top five in the long jump 
and the triple jump. Junior Sami 
Simmons took first in the long 
jump (4.88 meters) and second 
in the triple jump (10.02 meters). 
First-year Melissa Hwang took 
third in both events with 4.55 
meters and 9.60 meters, respec
tively. Fellow first-year Courtney 
Baker jumped 4.44 meters for 
fourth place in the long jump.
Sophomore Anna Lenhart fin
ished fourth in the 300-meter 
run with a time of 11:38.91. 
First-year Sarah Zuerndorfer also 
placed fourth in the pole vaults 
with 2.45 meters. The 4x400- 
meter relay A (4:21.43) and B 
(4:32.49) teams capped off the 
meet with solid first- and sec
ond-place finishes, respectively.
The teams compete Saturday 
at West Virginia University.
Swimming and diving finishes dual meets 7-1
LAUREN WINCHESTER
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon swim
ming and diving teams finished 
their dual meet season with a 
win at Westminster College, 
improving their record to 7-1. 
The womens team won seven of 
the events, ending with a score of 
108-95, while the men won seven 
events with a 115-88 score.
The Tartan womens relay team 
of first-year Molly Evans, sopho
more Sara Andrews, first-year 
Rebecca Ussai, and senior Lauren 
Connell won the 400-yard med
ley relay in a time of 4:07.96. 
Senior Xiao-Lan Wong led a 
sweep of the 1650-yard freestyle 
with a time of 18:57.69, followed 
by juniors Becky Martz and Tina 
Daup in 19:02.61 and 19:04.64, 
respectively.
Connell also won her two 
individual events, the 50- and 
100-yard freestyles, in 24.96 and 
53.95.
v We expected Westminster to 
be really competitive, and as a 
whole we did a really good job of
racing and finishing strong to the 
wall, Connell said. It was a nice 
way to cap off a really great dual 
meet season.
Evans was a double winner as 
well. She broke her own record 
in the 200-yard IM with a time 
of 2:09.59 and also broke a pool 
record in the 500-yard freestyle 
in 5:05.70. Finishing one-two 
in the 200-yard butterfly were 
Ussai and senior Anna Kochalko 
with times of 2:14.21 and 2:15.15, 
respectively.
The mens 400-yard med
ley relay team of sophomores 
John Johnson and Jason 
Huber, first-year Travis Piper, 
and senior Michael Bailey won 
in a time of 3:37.47. This was 
followed by an impressive pool 
record in the 1650-yard free
style by junior Tom McConnell in 
16:24.71. Senior Patrick Snyder 
won the 50-yard freestyle in 
21.90. The 200-yard IM proved 
to be an exciting race with soph
omore Andrew Weitz touching 
first-year Alex Hanson out by .18 
seconds for first place at 2:00.38.
Bailey won the 100-yard free
style in 47.97, followed by Snyder
in 48.39. The 200-yard back
stroke was another thrilling race 
between two Carnegie Mellon 
swimmers. Johnson clocked 
in first with a time of 1:59.12, 
followed closely by Hanson at 
1:59.98. The 500-yard freestyle

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team lost a pair of away 
University Athletic Assoication 
(UAA) games this past weekend.
Carnegie Mellon lost 76-57 to 
Case Western Reserve on Friday 
and fell at the hands of the Emory 
Eagles on Sunday by the score 
of 75-54. Poor shooting in the 
first half and too many turnovers 
 doomed Carnegie Mellon in both 
games. The Tartans are now 7-9 
overall and 0-5 in the UAA.
Against Case on Friday, 
Carnegie Mellon couldnt keep 
up with the Spartans in a difficult 
first half. The Tartans caught a 
break at the 16:58 mark when 
Cases second leading scorer, for
ward Ashley Horton, picked up 
two quick fouls and watched most 
of the first half from the bench.

Proof comes to a close
Caleb Charlands exhibit at Silver Eye closes this weekend
Matches, power tools, nails, glasses, jars, and 
magnets. To some, these everyday objects are 
both interesting and inspiring. For Caleb Charland 
of Brewer, Maine, they are even more than that:
They are the tools of science and the subjects of 
art. Charland was chosen as the recipient of the 
2007 Fellowship Award of the Silver Eye Gallery for 
Photography. His 17 black-and-white images won 
him his own exhibit at the Silver Eye Gallery, called  
Proof: Photographs by Caleb Charland. Charlands 
work is on display now, alongside the images from
10 other photographers who received honorable 
mentions.
The press release revealed that the winning images 
were selected by Katherine Ware, a curator at the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art. Charland was chosen as 
this years recipient of the Fellowship Award from a 
total of 282 members of Silver Eye, drawing from 32 
states and even two foreign countries.
Upon first viewing, Charland's prints are immediately 
arresting. The subject matter of the photographs are 
the everyday objects mentioned above, but they are 
shown as beautiful tools in playful experimentation, 
demonstrating scientific principles and exploring the 
boundaries of the imagination. As a result, Charland's 
images have a certain quietness about them; they are 
serene and simple visuals capturing energy, potential, 
and movement.
"By establishing physical parameters first, I discover 
each idea's visual potential," Charland explained in 
an artists statement on www.silvereye.org. This 
allows the natural properties of the subject matter to 
inform my aesthetic decisions as I construct these 
arenas to reveal the phenomena."
Before answering questions, Charland begins 
by asking them. I utilize everyday objects and 
fundamental forces to illustrate my own experiences 
with wonder," he added. "Each piece begins with 
a simple question (How would this look? Is that 
possible? What would. happen if...) and develops 
through a process of experimentation." The viewer 
experiences a similar wonder when interacting with 
his work, asking questions like, How did he do 
that?" This adds another layer to the experience of 
seeing his images.
At first glance, the viewer is presented with an 
unexpected and surreal image of light, time, science, 
and movement. All of the photographs in the exhibit
are thought-provoking and interactive; the image 
pushes the viewer mentally to contemplate and 
explore the possibilities of how such a photograph 
or motion can be created.
A particularly intriguing image, 300 Matches, 
displays the paths that ignited matches take 
when being dropped through a funnel. The effect 
highlights movement and explores the beautiful 
paths of light created by each match. The totality of 
the movements of the 300 matches is reminiscent 
of the soft ripples and patterns of a fluid.
Charland worked with his father remodeling homes 
in his youth, contributing to an interest in common 
household objects, according to Silver Eyes press 
release for the exhibit. Fueled by this interest, the 
objects shown in his photographs have surpassed 
the mundane, becoming transformed and magical 
and demonstrating the simple laws of nature. The 
overall feeling of the exhibit is a strategic, yet 
playful, merging of science and art.

A scene from the Sunday 
afternoon performance of 
The Consul.
A night at the opera
School of Music performs The Consul
The Consul, performed last week by the School of Music 
at the Purnell Center's Philip Chosky Theater, provided an 
excellent opportunity to enjoy a night at the opera without 
even leaving campus. The Consul is a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
opera written by Gian-Carlo Menotti, adapted for Carnegie 
Melloft by stage director Gregory Lehane, and conducted by 
Robert Page, professors in the schools of drama and music, 
respectively.
Lehane is well-known for directing television programs for 
Lifetime, TBS, PBS, and Nickelodeon. He was hailed as 
director of the year in 2003 by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
and was also nominated twice for an Emmy. Page is director 
of opera studies and choral activities at Carnegie Mellon and 
is known for directing the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh 
from 1979 to 2006.
"The theme of The Consul [is] government corruption," said 
Ida Lomibao, a sophomore professional writing and music 
performance major. Lomibao played the viola in the operas 
orchestra. It's set in an unnamed country under a very harsh 
dictatorship."
In the story, citizen John Sorel flees this unnamed country, 
leaving his family behind. His wife, Magda, is left to suffer 
under the harsh government.
The play opens with John returning home after a skirmish 
with the secret police; he hides while the police search for 
him. He decides to flee the country that very night and gives 
Magda instructions to go to the consulate and plead their 
case to the Consul, a foreign diplomat whose job is to protect 
the interests of his countrys citizens in this country. From 
this point on, the opera becomes successively darker, with the 
only comic relief coming from the antics of a magician in the 
consulate waiting room.
In Johns absence, Magda attempts to meet the Consul to try
to convince him to let her family flee as well, as the secret 
police are watching her. But to Magdas dismay, the Secretary 
does not allow her to meet the Consul for various legal 
reasons, forcing her to wait outside the consulate day after 
day filling out paperwork. In the time that follows, Magda's 
sick baby dies, and shortly after that, her mother passes away 
as well.
When she is finally allowed to meet with the Consul, Magda 
discovers that the secret police have been consorting with 
the Consul the whole time. Bereft of hope, Magda gets news 
that John has heard of the death of his baby and is returning. 
But to prevent him from putting his life in danger, she writes 
him a suicide note. Nevertheless, John returns and arrives at 
the consulate looking for her, but Magda has akeady left. The 
secret police, who have followed John, enter and arrest him, 
and the Secretary promises John that she will call and inform 
Magda. Meanwhile, Magda is at her home, trying to end her 
life. While she is close to death, the Secretarys phone call 
finally arrives and the phone rings, but as her hand reaches 
out to answer it, she dies.
Carnegie Mellons production of The Consul has alternate 
casts. Magda, played by senior music majors Michelle Dillon 
and Caitlyn Glennon, is the main character, and we watch as 
she endures one tragic event after another.
Magda Sorel is a hero in every sense of the word," Glennon 
said. "She fights on for the things she cares about, relying 
on the only thing she can: hope.... It has been an honor to 
play such a strong woman, to feel her pain and torment and 
discover hpw she rises above every obstacle.
I just really want everyone to listen to the words," said senior 
music major Chrystal E. Williams, who plays the role of the 
Secretary. The words are just... they're beautiful. [It] is true 
art the way [Menotti] wrote [the words] and the music with 
them... It's just stunning.
These sentiments ring true as both the music and singing 
are spectacular. And Magdas line, My name is Sorel, Magda 
Sorel, the wife of Sorel the lover of freedom, stays with you 
through the entire opera.
The stage was brought to life with emotion, drawing the 
audience into the world of Magda and her despair. One 
especially beautiful moment in the opera was when Magdas 
mother sang to her grandson before he died.
It is particularly moving [when] the mother sings a beautiful 
aria [operatic solo].... The words are phenomenal, said 
Williams.
The Magicians tricks of hypnotism in the consulate waiting 
room are also enjoyable, drawing many laughs. The opera 
successfully incites a feeling of sympathy towards the people 
in the waiting room, hoping to get their visas. Their individual 
plights are revealed in the course of the opera, causing a 
feeling of resentment against the corrupt system.
The opera succeeds in holding the audiences attention 
throughout the show. Although the audience is provided 
with a plot synopsis, watching it unfold onstage is a different 
experience altogether.
The opera won the Pulitzer Prize in 1950 and the New York 
Drama Critics Circle award for Best Musical. Apart from being 
a brilliant musical piece, it also has the added benefit of being 
written in English, which makes it easy to follow. Menotti, 
who wrote both the words and the music, passed away last 
year on Feb. 1.

The deal with Oscar nominations
This years motley mix of Academy nomineesOn music journalism
In the days leading up to the release of the Oscar 
nominations for the 80th annual ceremony, no 
nominee was certain  except for the critical hit 
No Country for Old Men, released'in November and 
directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film, which 
follows three characters chasing each other after 
one of them finds a suitcase of cash, is already the 
frontrunner for Best Picture.
But other Oscar nominations this past Tuesday were 
a surprise. Jason Reitman, the director of indie hit 
Juno, received'his first nomination for Best Director 
on only his second film, his follow-up to Thank You for 
Smoking. Laura Linney, star of the family drama The 
Savages, also received a surprise nomination for Best 
Actress.
Perhaps the most surprising nomination was Tommy 
Lee Joness inclusion in the race for Best Actor for his 
role in the overlooked Iraq war drama In the Valley of 
Elah, a film penned and directed by Paul Haggis, the 
Oscar-winning writer-director of Crash, which won 
Best Picture in 2006.
Elah flopped at the box office during its early fall 
release, despite critical praise for Tommy Lee Joness 
portrayal of a father seeking the answer to the 
disappearance of his soldier son. While early Oscar 
buzz had pegged him a nominee, as the race heated 
up, many trade publications assumed the slot would 
go to a younger or more distinguished actor, such as 
previous winners Russell Crowe, Denzel Washington 
for American Gangster, or James McAvoy for his 
romantic lead in Atonement. Entertainment Weekly 
correctly predicted four of the Best Actor nominees 
but gave Jones's slot to Ryan Gosling for Lars and the 
Real Girl, expecting the Mickey Mouse Club alums 
second nomination in as many years.
Carnegie Mellon alumnus Stephen Schwartz received 
three nominations in the Best Original Song category 
for the live-action Disney princess flick Enchanted, 
leaving only two slots for other songs  one from the 
Irish indie musical Once and one from the kiddie flop 
August Rush.
Some of the bigger surprises were for what or who 
didn't receive nominations. On the day nominations 
were announced, the haunting score of Paul Thomas 
Andersons epic There Will Be Blood was disqualified 
from the Best Score race for drawing too heayily on 
existing compositions. Joe Wright, director of the lush 
period piece Atonement, didnt receive a nomination 
for Best Director despite a much-talked-about 
five-and-a-half-minute continuous shot through a 
battlefield.
Sean Penn's directorial debut, Into the Wild, received 
only two nominations  one for film editing and one 
for 82-year-old Hal Holbrook for Best Supporting Actor. 
Many had expected a nomination for Penn's direction, 
as well as recognition in the Adapted Screenplay 
category, especially since Penn has already been
nominated for Best Director by the Directors Guild of 
America.
In the Animated Feature race, the forgettable Surf's 
Up!, featuring penguins voiced by random celebrities, 
edged out The Simpsons Movie for the third slot. Surf's 
Up! will vie with Ratatouille and Persepolis for the 
Oscar.
For some, the most shocking list of nominees came 
in the Best Foreign Film category. There was drama 
even early in the selection process, when Israels 
original nominee, The Band's Visit, was disqualified 
for featuring too much English. The Band's Visits 
ineligibility was only brought to attention by people 
associated with the second choice, Beaufort, which 
then became Israels nominee for Foreign Film 
and which was nominated for the Oscar on Jan.
22. The Best Foreign Film race was also a source 
of controversy because it lacked films like Ang 
Lees erotic NC-17 film Lust, Caution and Cannes 
Palme dOr winner 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days, 
a Romanian film focusing on an illegal abortion. 
Persepolis, a nominee for Animated Film and Frances 
official candidate, did not receive a Foreign Film 
nomination, which was also surprising.
But for many, more important than the Oscar 
nominees was the question of whether the Oscars 
will even happen. The producer of the broadcast, Gil 
Cates, has said that the Oscars will occur in some 
form no matter what.
In the past week, strike blogs like Nikki Finkes 
Deadline Hollywood Daily {www. 
deadlinehollywooddaily.com) have noted increasingly 
optimistic talks between the Writer's Guild of 
America (WGA) and the Academy of Motion Picture 
and-Television Producers (AMPTP). This news, on 
the heels of a deal between the Directors Guild of 
America and the AMPTP diverting a future strike 
by that guild, is promising for a real Oscar ceremony 
featuring clips from the nominated films as well as 
stars.-If the WGA does not arrive at a deal or interim 
agreement prior to the Feb. 24 telecast, they may 
picket the ceremony, which may cause other guilds, 
such as the Screen Actors Guild, to refuse to attend 
the Oscars if it means crossing a picket line.
However, the Academy insists the Oscars will go on 
with or without the stars that are, for many viewers,* 
the big draw. There are only four acting categories 
among the Academys 27 total categories, USA Today 
notes, and thus the star power will certainly not affect 
the size of the Oscar audience if the Screen Actors 
Guild decides to skirt the ceremony.
But lets not think about that. If talks stay positive, the 
strike shouldnt be a problem by Feb. 24 anyway.

The process of writing about music is harder than most people realize. 
Many of my friends and I make fun of the fact that reviewers have said 
that bands possess an "angular guitar sound so many times that its now 
a completely meaningless term, but what we often forget is this problem: 
How the hell do you actually say what it is a guitar sounds like? When a 
writer sits down to describe an album, how does he do it?
The downfall of writing about rock bands is twofold. Certain descriptions, 
like twangy guitars, have almost lost their meaning because so many 
bands can be described that way. On the other hand, when discussing 
experimental music, its accurate to say, microsound, square waves 
between 20 and 200 Hz, but that doesn't mean anything to most readers. 
Experimental sounds are heard less often than twangy guitars," and the 
connections between the terminology and the visceral feelings that listening 
elicits are less internalized. Often the writer seems to just give up, resulting 
in trash like Pitchforks infamous review of Autechres Draft 7.30; possibly 
the worst music writing Ive ever read, the review is a dramatic dialogue in 
the style of (read: ripping off) Douglas Hofstadters Godel, Escher, Bach: An 
Eternal Golden Braid, offering absolutely no information about the release 
itself. In either case, theres obviously a problem.
Retrospective of his long career, Japanese noise artist Merzbow released 
a 50-CD box set called The Merzbox. Not many people are interested 
in more than two days of music primarily composed of harsh noise (his 
album 1930, for example, sounds a lot like amplified wiping of sweaty 
hands on cellophane as some jackhammers tear apart a sidewalk), but the 
people Who are interested are, as a rule, very interested. So, even though 
reviewing this behemoth is an undertaking, several serialized reviews of the 
whole box set were published shortly after its release. I recently read them. 
Many began timidly and with honest effort, but by the sets last 15 albums, 
the reviews turned into diaries, rants, and personal stories  no longer 
about the music. Is this appropriate? Is that really music journalism?
I think that Merzbow was aware of the kind of reviews The Merzbox 
would receive; he may have made it as it is in order to elicit these kinds of 
questions. He is quite aware of the critical attention devoted to his music, 
often enclosing little manifestos in his albums (usually about animal cruelty 
or bondage techniques, two of his favorite topics), which many reviews 
devote at least as much attention to as the music itself.
The question Is, what is the role of music journalism? When writing about 
music, what information is important? Currently, a music review can be 
anything from a pure description of the sound to the authors analysis of 
how the release fits into its context or even a diary entry for the reviewer. 
Unless more writers are able to find some sort of middle ground, the 
question remains as to whether music journalism is even a meaningful 
enterprise.

Always a bridesmaid
27 Dresses offers hope to the wedding party
Boy meets girl, boy gets rejected by girl, boy secretly writes 
newspaper article about girl, boy and girl get trashed and 
sing Bennie and the Jets" at a bar in upstate New York. 27 
Dresses is the perfect off-kilter love story, tailor-made for its 
gloomy January release in between the warmth of Christmas 
and the romance of Valentines Day.
Jane Nichols (Katherine Heigl) is organized, dependable, 
and uptight  what Carnegie Mellon students would call 
"ambitious"  which makes her the ideal bridesmaid for 
her soon-to-be married friends (approximately 27 of them). 
Laid-back, confident Kevin Doyle (James Marsden) is a 
newspaper journalist who covers weddings for the. fictional 
New York Journal under the pseudonym Malcolm Doyle. The 
two meet at  shocker  one such wedding, when Kevin 
rushes to Janes aid after she is trampled by a stampede of 
women trying to catch the brides bouquet.
The majority of the movie shows Kevin shamelessly 
propositioning Jane to no avail. Little does she know that 
Kevin doesnt want to get into her pants, just her closet. Hes 
decided to propose an article on the perpetual bridesmaid"
 i.e., Jane  to his boss to further his career.
In a strangely, almost inappropriately, intimate moment,
Jane eases off on loathing Kevin for enough time to agree to
model all 27 dresses for him in her apartment. Apparently, 
Jane attends a disproportionate number of bizarrely themed 
weddings, because she patiently, if not hysterically, explains 
the details of the cowboy wedding," "the underwater 
wedding, and "the Gone with the Wind wedding, among  
others. Kevin takes pictures, which later accompany the 
article that he writes without Janes knowledge. She doesnt 
find out until the morning after the two end up drunk in a bar, 
performing a rousing rendition of the 1970s Elton John and 
Bernie Taupin hit, Bennie and the Jets, after which the two 
snuggle up for a quickie in Janes car.
Side note: Janes rejection of Kevin has to do with the 
fact that she's in love with her boss, George (Ed Burns). 
Unfortunately, Janes younger sister, Tess (Malin Akerman) 
drops into town and sweeps George off his feet by telling 
elaborate lies (i.e., shes a vegan when she actually loves 
burgers, she adores dogs when shes actually allergic to 
them, etc.) while Jane fumes silently in the background.
I saw the movie with my own younger sister, a true 
romantic for romantic comedies. We felt bad for Jane  
until she exposes Tess for who she really is at the couples 
engagement party, after which they call off the wedding (at 
which point I should have leaned over and whispered, Id 
never do that to you! But... you never know). We cheered
A Sly return
Rambo fights back, with hundreds of casualties
"When youre pushed, killing's as easy as breathing. Never 
before has this statement been proven with the intensity 
shown in Rambo.
Sylvester Sly" Stallone is back, reviving another movie 
franchise that seemed finished, as John Rambo, a Vietnam 
War vet and the king of kicking ass and taking names. 
However, we see a different Rambo in the beginning. He is 
living in Thailand and working as a boatman, fishing and 
hunting for a living. He has become indifferent to the world 
around him, even while a civil war entering its 60th year 
rages on in nearby Burma.
Rambos new life of relative peace and quiet is interrupted 
by a group of missionaries looking for passage into Burma 
to help some refugees. He flatly refuses, on the grounds 
that they will change nothing and likely be killed. One of 
the missionaries, played by Julie Benz, is able to convince 
Rambo that their work can save lives and he relents. Some 
time later, Rambo is greeted by a pastor who says the 
missionaries are being held captive by Burmese fighters 
and begs our hero to bring the mercenaries hes hired to the 
village to rescue them.
scene in which the missionaries are captured is one of the 
most violent and horrifying scenes in motion picture history 
because of the degree of slaughter of so many innocent 
people. Some truly torturous scenes, including a terrifying 
game the rebels play with some captives, give the movie an 
almost sickening nature. Indeed, this film is the deadliest of 
the entire Rambo quadrilogy, with a whopping 236 deaths 
portrayed along with an untold amount of blood and guts. 
With a running time of about 90 minutes, thats almost three 
deaths per minute.
Inevitably, the viewer is treated to the least favorite part of 
most action movies: the dialogue. And an even better treat 
is that this is Stallone's dialogue; he wrote and directed 
this film himself, which is not a bad thing at all, since some 
scenes in this movie make the other Rambo films look quite 
tame in comparison. The vast majority of Slys lines are single 
sentences, a good idea because you truly cannot help but 
laugh at some of the things he tries to say. Some particularly 
hilarious moments come when Rambo is pushed by people 
and he rages at them in his garbled, growling voice. On the 
plus side, once the action gets going, no actor speaks more 
than 10 words at a time, letting the killing speak for itself. .
What follows is when the bulk of the action takes place. The If you can see through the action, the film does have a
when, in an unexpected turn of events, Jane gets the chance 
to score with George  and turns it down. Fortunately, in 
a predictable but anxiously awaited climactic ending, we 
learned that nice, cynical girls dont always finish last... and 
thats all Im going to say about that.
27 Dresses was written and directed by two chick flick 
experts, Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada) 
and Anne Fletcher {The Wedding Planner). As a female, I 
feel partially responsible for keeping the romantic comedy 
genre in business and rentable en masse at Blockbuster, 
but thats not why you should see this film. The plot moves 
quickly, the main characters are quirky and dynamic, and 
the movie takes some surprisingly unexpected turns  but 
nevertheless lives up to its promise to be a classic romantic 
comedy with a scathingly predictable ending.
And, last but not least, we got to see some pretty swanky 
apparel. Call me unromantic, but I maintain that the best part 
of the film is the 27 dresses, not the hackneyed lpve affairs 
that end up stealing the show.

serious point to make. Before the movie begins, we are 
shown a montage of actual news clips showing atrocities 
taking place around the world. Missionaries who go to help 
are being killed, as shown in the film. It depicts the good 
that these people do only to have it all wiped out when the 
military arrives and starts the slaughter. Its an unspoken 
call to action to halt what people across the globe are calling 
genocide.
With that all said, at its core, this is a Rambo movie. If 
you lack the thirst for violence, slaughter, and gore that is 
necessary to watch this movie, then in the name of all that 
is good and holy, stay away. But for those of us who need to 
see some bodies dismembered every once in a while, Rambo 
is perfect and proves once again why Stallone is a legend of 
action cinema.

From burritos to margaritas
Mad Mex trumps its alternative counterparts
For all those fans of Si Seor, be informed: There is another 
alliterative Tex-Mex joint in town. I am writing, of course, 
of Mad Mex, a bar and restaurant chain most conveniently 
located on Atwood St. in South Oakland.
Mad Mex offers the shadowy, seductive qualities of a Tijuana 
bar  except without the Mexico. Th dcor is a half-comical, 
half-legitimate mix of western-looking decorations, from fake 
(hopefully) animal skulls to multi-colored Christmas lights. 
Meanwhile, green glass jars turned light fixtures hang from 
the ceiling, creating an enchanting, almost seedy vibe  
again, without the Mexico.
For lovers of Tex-Mex, Mad Mex is an obvious choice, 
serving the usual tacos, burritos, quesadillas, fajitas, and 
enchiladas, ranging from $7 to $15. Over half of the options 
are vegetarian or "veggie possible, the menu advertises,'and 
most come with a choice of chicken, steak, shrimp, portabella 
mushrooms, or tofu  that's two delicious options for burrito 
craving herbivores.
If all the -illas, -itas, and -chiladas are intimating,
I recommend starting with a burrito. From the Super Mad 
Mex Burrito (zesty spinach, chickpea chili) to the Carnitas 
Burrito (slow-roasted pork with a side of blue cornbread),
Mad Mex burritos are 
all artfully executed, 
resulting in meals both 
pretty to look at and
wonderful to eat. Customers can pay $1.95 for double the 
protein, or request a whole-wheat tortilla gratis.
For one thing, the menu offers the standard Texican soups 
and salads, but the aforementioned quesadillas take the 
cake (or maybe flan) when it comes to lighter fare. Mad Mex 
quesadillas are sensibly cheesed and easy to eat  ideal for 
dates.
Appetizers are not a must (the main courses are satisfying 
enough), although the cleverly named "Pickadippa might 
-be an exception. Here, customers choose three salsas or dips 
to devour with an unlimited quantity of tortilla chips. Those 
interested should order the Pepita Hummus, a dip so infused 
with Tex-Mex flavors that it tastes like you stuck your chip in 
salsa, guacamole, and hummus.
Clearly, Mad Mex is a desirable locale for those craving Southof-the-border cuisine, but what about everyone else? Its hard, 
sometimes, to find a group of friends all hungry for the same 
type of food, but, luckily, Mad Mex is accommodating. The
menu offers an 
entire Los Wingos 
section, with flavor levels
mild, wild, and insane. Wing- _______
ordering customers should exercise 
caution, though; the "wild are as hot as most 
taste-buds can stand. Along with wings, Mad Mex 
serves two Thai-inspired dishes, a wrap and a burrito  
perfect for that member of the group who was more in the 
mood for Bangkok Balcony.
And if theres one thing friends can agree on  those 21 and 
over, anyway  its alcohol. The Mad Mex bar is fully stocked 
and of-age visitors might consider the sangria (red or white) 
or one of about a million varieties of margarita, from hibiscus 
to tamarind. Theyre delicious, so Ive heard (from my 21-yearold amigos).

Speedy Delivery
Carnegie Mellon graduates complete documentary about Mr. McFeely
f by Amanda Cole | Pillbox Editor 1
Most American children remember seeing Mister Rogers' 
Neighborhood at some point during their childhood, and 
anyone who remembers seeing the show remembers 
Mister Rogers' friend, Mr. McFeely. Mr. McFeely, played 
by David Newell, delivered mail with the cheerful line, 
Speedy Delivery!
In tribute to Mr. McFeelys role on the show and his 
continued appearances as the character, Carnegie Mellon 
graduates Paul Germain (Heinz 06), Friedrich Myers (CFA 
03), and Bryan Senti (CFA 05, Heinz 06), along with co
producer Stuart Friedel, have created a documentary of 
Newells life. The documentary explores both Newells life 
and his experience as the character Mr. McFeely.
As Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which aired new 
episodes from 1967 to.2001, is approaching its 40th 
anniversary, Newell continues to make public appearances 
at least once a week.dressed as Mr. McFeely. His 
dedication to carrying on Fred Rogers legacy takes him on 
trips across the country to visit children and make public 
appearances.
Germain, the documentary's director and co-producer, had 
been searching for a subject for a documentary, and when 
Germain saw Newell at an appearance at the Pittsburgh 
Mills Mall, he knew hed found his subject.
I wondered what motivated him to be so passionate for 
40 years, said Germain. "I talked to him for a while and 
he directed me to Family Communications, Inc. (FCI), [the 
company that produces Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]. I 
thought people could benefit from seeing the way he lives
his life."
In the documentary, Newells life is shown both at home 
and in character, allowing viewers to explore a natural 
curiosity about the real life of a well known television 
character. Besides his everyday life, the film explores his 
relationship with Fred Rogers and aspects of his childhood.
It gets into who he is as a person, where he's been, where 
hes going, said Germain. This is a film that takes a slice 
of a persons life and uses that as a context to talk about 
something much larger.
The movie serves as a sortof Mister Rogers' Neighborhood 
retrospective in addition to a portrait of David Newell as 
Mr. McFeely. Germain received permission from FCI to 
use clips, music, and still pictures from the show, which 
ran new episodes for 35 years, in his documentary. These 
assets will allow the documentary to explore the history of 
the show while new footage will show a more'behind-thescenes look at Newells life.
Its interesting to see how the childhood character 
operates now and still assumes the role of Mr. McFeely, 
and how this has affected his family, said Senti, who 
composed the films score.
The music in the film is a mix of original music and 
traditional music from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. In  
shots where Newell is with Fred Rogers, the original music 
from Mister Rogers Neighborhood is used. For the other 
parts of the movie, however, Senti composed music that 
he said would act as an opposition to that music. He 
used the blues style because it is what he called peoples
music, which seemed more appropriate in situations 
involving Newell and other people.
Myers, the sound designer for the film, worked with Senti 
to create the score for Speedy Delivery. According to 
Myers, Senti bounced ideas off of him and they worked 
together to create the final product. Myers did the final 
sound design, adding in sounds that were more lush where 
he could, creating a professional final product.
Pittsburgh Connections
While some people see Pittsburgh as a temporary home, 
Rogers and Newell worked in Pittsburgh for over 30 years 
filming Mister Rogers Neighborhood. In order to stay true 
to their Pittsburgh spirit, Speedy Delivery was ghot in 
Pittsburgh, maintaining the strong ties to the city that are 
associated with the show.
"Weve mimicked Mister Rogers' beginning, but with real 
streets and real houses, Germain said. We want people to 
know that Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is Pittsburgh."
In addition to having Pittsburgh connections because of 
the subject matter, the film has a strong Carnegie Mellon 
influence. Besides Germain, Senti, and Myers, there 
were a large number of Carnegie Mellon alumni involved 
in the making of the film. Several members of the cast 
of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, including Joe Negri 
(Handyman Negri), Maggie Stewart (Mayor), Audrey Roth 
(Miss Paulificate), and Francois Clemmons (Officer), are 
graduates, and the university awarded Fred Rogers an 
honorary degree in 1976. Graduates have also worked on 
the art and production end of the show; Kathy Borland

 numerous appearances as

"Speedy Delivery." Rogers and Newell worked together on

served as art director, and Bonnie McCarter Vaky and Matt 
Marcus were members of-the art and production crew.
The Johnny Costa Trio (Johnny Costa, Carl McVicker, and 
Bobby Rawsthorne), who recorded the well-known tunes 
found in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, were also Carnegie 
Mellon graduates.
"Paul Germain was somebody I met at Carnegie Mellon," 
Senti said, and the subject matter is Pittsburgh-sensitive 
and related to those five years [I spent there]. This reason, 
he said, influenced his decision to join Germains project 
even more than his sense of loyalty to the show.
For Myers, the reasons for becoming involved were related 
to his friendship with Senti. Senti had introduced Myers 
and Germain, and from there the two discussed ideas for 
the movie.
By the end of the evening, we just [decided] to do it. It was 
the alumni connection and friend-of-a-friend connection, 
he said, that made him decide to become involved. -
The strong connection Carnegie Mellon has with Mister 
Rogers' Neighborhood is made even stronger with Speedy 
Delivery. The film was partially,funded by Carnegie 
Mellon's Office of the Provost.
Vice Provost of Education Indira Nair made the decision to 
fund Germains vision for a documentary.
"Paul Germains proposal to make a documentary about 
Mister Rogers' seemed a worthwhile project to preserve 
something about a very important and unique story about 
one of the most important early childhood educators ever," 
she wrote in in e-mail. [And at] the time, I had a grant for 
broad educational projects.
Courtesy of FCI
Through the help of Carnegie Mellon and other generous 
means, Speedy Delivery was able to obtain $4500 for 
production, a huge amount for a documentary. The 
relatively high budget allowed Germain and the rest of the 
crew to develop the documentary to such a point that they 
were all satisfied with the final product, a process that took 
three and a half years to complete.
I think its going to be close to the heart to people in 
Pittsburgh since its a local story, Senti said.
Childrens television
Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was known for educating 
its viewers, whether through glimpses at a crayon 
factory or through skits performed by the puppets in the 
Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Despite the emotional and 
practical knowledge gained by children from watching  
shows like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, other shows have 
been replacing it in television slots across the country.
Part of Newells purpose in continuing to make 
appearances in the character of Mr. McFeely is to find a 
home for Mister Rogers' Neighborhood on television today. 
The series has thousands of episodes in its long history, 
and with the use of modern technology (such as the 
Internet and On Demand), it might find a permanent home.
"[Newell] spent 35 years serving the public working in 
children's television and giving kids an educational tool so 
they can learn, Myers said.
Everyone involved with Speedy Delivery believes that 
continuing in the tradition of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood 
is a worthwhile effort, and the show is beneficial to children 
even now.
If you look at modern childrens television, it isn't 
congruent with the high standards that were set by Mister 
Rogers," Germain said. You could call [Mister Rogers'] old 
' school, but it's so valid and authentic; it's a way of using 
television as a positive medium.
"So much of whats on television today does not respect 
[children] in the manner that Mister Rogers did," he 
continued. It makes the assumption that children deserve 
to be entertained, not educated and respected, and so 
much of what I love about David Newells story is that 
[he] represents something I wish there was more of in the 
world.
Newells story shows that there are still people in the 
world who are genuine. He takes the time to speak to each 
person individually at his appearances, and he "lives for 
the happiness of other people, according to Germain. 
While Newell believes he is just spreading Rogers legacy, 
Germain believes differently.
While a final release date has not been set, Speedy Delivery 
has been entered into several film festivals.
"There are so many documentaries about whats wrong 
in the world, said Germain. "I wanted to make a 
documentary about what's right in the world.
Find out more about Speedy Delivery at www. 
speedydeliverymovie.com or myspace.com/ 
speedydeliverymovie.
One of the things we're trying to get across [is that 
Newell] is leaving behind a legacy of his own by doing 
what he does, he said.

Rtrospectif: Five Hundred Sixty Two
Low-brow art with a retro twist
From Jan. 5 through Jan. 26, the art gallery moxie DaDA @ 
the firehouse exhibited work from Pittsburgh-area artist Toby 
Atticus Fraley and Nashville artist Mr. Hooper. The show, 
Retrospectif: Five Hundred Sixty Two, featured vintage and 
retro style paintings from both artists, as well as several 
mixed media robots and clockworks by Fraley.
We featured both artists for a couple of reasons," said Grant 
Bobitski, the exhibits curator.We met Toby and Mr. Hooper 
at the Arts Festival two years ago, and we really liked their 
work, and they both work really well together with their retro 
riffs. They are younger, which is something we look for.
"Lastly, January is a month where we try to pair an artist from 
Pittsburgh with one from outside of the city. Its a kind of 
annual event we try to put together.
Fraley-is recognized for his robots, two of which reside in 
separate, private collections of Grammy Award-winning 
musicians. The robots are built from vintage items, such as 
vacuum cleaners and picnic coolers, bought from places like 
yard sales and eBay auctions. Each robot is turned into a 
lamp or a room accent light, with a round-roofed, cylindrical. 
light bulb for the head.
Featured robots at the exhibit included Robot 13," a robot 
soldier with an amputated leg, holding itself up with a 
single crutch, waving a white flag whose pole is made from 
a foot-long ruler. The robot soldier's stand has the image of 
George Bush with airplane bombers overhead and alternating 
red and white stripes above that image. The low-wattage 
light on its head, the robots body, and the fiber optic cables 
sticking out of its severed leg all light up.
Ive always been a big fan of the early space race era," Fraley 
said. During that time a lot of artwork and objects came out 
with that certain look that has a lot of spacey feel to it. It just 
all seems better designed, basically.
Spacey is the best word to describe Fraleys sculpture, 
ATR. Made from a vintage power inverter, coffee percolator, 
electrical parts, a truck light, and other miscellaneous items, 
the sculpture looked like a boxy, robotic puppy with wheels 
for legs. It resembled the type of robotic dogs youd see on 
The Jetsons.
DaDA's guest book included a comment from a visitor who 
wrote down his impression of the exhibit; referencing Lost in 
Space, it read, "Danger, Will Robinson!
Hooper's paintings included an array of attitude-filled 
animals, robots, and portraits of famous cultural icons as well 
as ordinary people. His work is reminiscent of work by Robert 
Crumb, who illustrated comics including Keep on Truckin  
and American Splendor. It created a gritty complement to 
Fraleys work.
"I met him a couple of years ago in an art festival, and I first 
saw his work there," Fraley said of Hooper. I liked his work
then, and so when I heard Id be in a show with him, I was 
really glad. I dont know what it is about the look of his work, 
but I like it. I was thrilled to be in a show with him, actually."
Hoopers smaller paintings included a sassy penguin 
exclaiming Love me," a butch Popeye-esque woman with an 
arm tattoo "Sweetie," and a robot squirting a water gun. The 
gun left the words Do You Believe In Love in its wake. The 
text within his paintings is written in a messy, comic book 
style youd see in Fritz the Cat. However, not all of Hoopers 
paintings are in that exaggerated style. One work was of a 
blue bird with a circular backdrop. It resembled the envelope 
seals that are given as a gift, via postal mail, for contributing 
to charities or fundraisers.
Hoopers work is very accessible because, for lack of a better 
word, its popular," said Matthew Indovina, moxie DaDAs 
organizational manager. Many people can relate to the 
images.
He commented that Hooper has a large following, and many 
of the visitors fall into the 20- to 30-year-old age group.
"People that grew up on comic books and action figures really 
connect to his art, he said.
Also exhibited by Hooper was a portrait of American country 
singer-songwriter Johnny Cash and wrestler Wild Bull Curry, 
along with a painting of an abstract, roboticized Abraham 
Lincoln. Lincolns head was of portrait quality, connected to 
a square vacuum cleaner body. His neck was the Slinky-like 
tubing of a vacuum. He had black crow wings and was 
plucking a flower with his crows feet, with rays of lights 
folding out behind him.
The combination of these two artists' work created an easy, 
fun experience. Fraley's clockworks could make.viewers 
laugh, while his robots were reminiscent of old TV shows. 
Hoopers work brought back old cultural icons and retro art, a 
sort of visual homage to old messages like "Keep on truckin!
In terms of the concept, physical pieces and layout of 
the show, it was a success," Bobitski said. I liked the 
accompaniment, the way everything complemented each 
other."
Opening night saw a large crowd, comprised of many fans 
who followed Hooper's work. One group even came from 
Canada for a business trip and stayed three extra days just to 
see the show.
My only regret is that Mr. Hooper wasnt here for very long, 
Indovina said. We like to spend time with our artists; getting 
to know them is part of our policy. But I could only meet him 
in passing this time around. I would've liked to buy him a 
beer.

A monster may try to eat you tomorrow, so remember to bring a bagged 
lunch.
Bless your heart. While you were sleeping last night, one of your kidneys 
was donated to charity. You can remove the stitches from your back in 
seven weeks.
A man with no shoes will steal yours the moment you decide to remove 
them. Please keep your shoes on at all costs. You can always put 
plastic bags over your shoes when you shower. It's not a big deal.
Keep your eyes open for a cotton candy parade.
Sudoku
Eat more beef or the cows will overpopulate, putting more methane gas 
into the air. Let's protect our ozone layer.
Let this be your lesson of the day. Your eyes are twinkling.
You will have many long bowel movements today, so remember to bring 
a bagged lunch.
Don't bag your lunch today.
Your classes are canceled for tomorrow, so you have just enough time 
to build an igloo for survival.
Don't stare into the sun and don't stare at your feet. Just look forward, 
keep your head straight, and no whistling. Unless you want to be eaten 
by a monster, too.
think it's about time you looked into adoption.
Your hair will shimmer, but your lips will be chapped. Go buy some 
ChapStick at the wonderful Entropy+. I hear all the ChapStick there 
tastes like dog food.
