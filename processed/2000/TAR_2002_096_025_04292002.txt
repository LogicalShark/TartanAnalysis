JFC disclosure disputed
Committee fumbles with budget numbers
by Aseem Gupta
THEARNbyANEs emNAHR
Every student organization wants 
their piece of the student activities 
fee pie. This year, as in most previous 
years, requests for funding were far 
more than the Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) could provide. 
Student organizations requested 
$1.5 million while only $750,000 
was available. Naturally when 
requests are not met student organi
zations begin to question the funda
mental structure of the Joint Funding 
Process. Again, this year is no differ
ent.
We made our best efforts to assess 
what was absolutely necessary to an 
organization and to cut what was a 
want rather than a need, said 
Jennifer Lane, a junior computer sci
ence major and chair of the JFC. For 
the most part I think we did a good 
job of this.
Lane said that the only place that 
there was room for improvement was 
in the funding of JFC. She went on to 
say that she does not believe that any 
conflicts of interest exist in the JFC 
process.
Each year, recognized and funded 
organizations request funding subsi
dies from the JFC, a group charged 
with distributing limited funds 
derived from the Student Activities 
Fee to student organizations. These 
organizations submit detailed, lineitemed budgets to the JFC, which 
reviews and modifies the budgets to 
meet the fiscal constraints of Student 
Government. Organizations are 
allowed to appeal their budgets to 
seek adjustments when they find the 
reviewed budget unsatisfactory. 
Some appeals are successful  at 
least one appeal this year resulted in 
more than 100 percent increase in 
subsidy  others are not.
I have a lot of respect for the peo
ple who sit on the JFC board  they 
ended up at the eleventh hour having 
to cut an additional $100,000 from 
the budgets, said Quinten
THEARNH byHsesHsRm GsR
Steenhuis, a sophomore computation 
and logic major and chair of Student 
Senates Internal Affairs Committee. 
While most students involved with 
the JFC point only to more funding as 
the solution to their woes, Steenhuis 
feels that there are other things that 
can be done to help the process in the 
future. For example, this summer 
Senate will embark on a plan to build 
a new information system for the 
funding process.
[It will] allow people to submit 
budget information that will be avail
able in a much more intelligent 
form, said Steenhuis. People will be 
able to generate reports that say [for 
example] this is how much were 
spending on food altogether.
Recently, however, members of the 
Executive branch of Student 
Government, as well as Senate have 
brought access to such information 
into question. On Thursday, at 1:24 
pm, 2002 - 2003 organization bud
gets were released in their entirety to 
the student body. By 6:16 pm on 
Saturday, detailed line items  the 
information that tells students exact
ly what organizations are spending 
money on  were gone.
Before Thursday, Senate had an 
undocumented precedent of at least 
three years not to release line items 
to the student body, according to 
sudent body President-elect Brian 
Namey, a junior in ethics, history, 
and public policy. However, marking 
a departure from recent practice, 
Steenhuis released the full budgets 
for 2002 - 2003 on Thursday. When 
asked about the release of informa
tion, Steenhuis responded via email 
Friday morning that, We're interest
ed in having an open government. In 
some ways it may be a departure, yes, 
but it's something that we're commit
ted to. He went on to say that, the 
budgets have always been available 
upon request.
In an interview Friday afternoon, 
Namey said, however, that the long
standing policy of Student

Cheating: should we trust the code?
by Ish Harshawat
THEARNbyANEs emNAHR
One night last semester, School 
of Computer Science professor and 
associate dean Peter Lee had a little 
too much time on his hands and 
says he did something he now 
regrets....
His colleagues at Georgia Tech 
had recently gone through a cheat
ing scandal of sorts in an introduc
tory computer science course. 
Running a home-brewed similarity 
detector they found about 186 out 
of 1700 students had turned in 
assignments that contained dupli
cations in programming code, a 
violation of the universitys honor 
code.
A mother of one of the Tech stu
dents that failed the course sent out 
a letter to the heads of the nations 
top computer science departments. 
In it she asked what their standards 
were for cheating, and whether her 
son would have been failed at those

It made me wonder what was 
going on, says Lee. He down

Student College to premiere in the fall
by Jeannie Choi
GAupptRNAaR
For most seniors, their last year is 
focused on preparing themselves for 
the real world. Ian Nieves is focused 
on leaving a legacy to Carnegie 
Mellon.
As the president of the Student 
College program. Nieves hopes that 
students will be able to teach their 
own courses, after the program gains 
approval from the Undergraduate 
Education Council (UEC).
We hope vH enrich the student 
body and enrich the course choices 
so that when students go to choose 
their courses, they can find some that 
are not strictly academic, said 
Nieves.
Nieves and a few other students
interested in teaching a course 
approached Mark Stehlik, assistant 
dean of undergraduate education, 
for direction as to how such a pro
gram could be implemented in 
Carnegie Mellon.
As students, Stehlik, and Nair 
began to collaborate, a clearer pic
ture of how the program would get 
started formed.
We had to submit an official pro
posal and charter to Indira Nair and 
the UEC, said Nieves. It got turned 
down the first time, but after a few 
revisions, it finally got accepted as a 
pilot proposal for one year. Its going 
to be evaluated at the end of the year. 
The evaluation will start next semes
ter.
In preparation for this evaluation, 
the committee began to seek students 
who were willing and able to teach
courses in the coming fall semester. 
However, some controversy over the 
legitimacy of allowing students to 
teach courses for credit arose from 
the UEC. There are some people 
who feel that students should not be 
able to teach courses for credit 
because they are not legitimate 
teachers, said Nieves. But I think 
that students have many things that 
they know, and students that know 
something exceptionally well should 
be able to teach it. By offering credit, 
we can run a formal class and every
body will treat it like a class.
Stehlik offered his own opinion 
about the controversy.
A lot of undergraduates assist in 
the educational process at CMU as 
[teaching assistants], so there is a lot

Future of learning may lie in SCS project
by Christopher Chung
ruEusNEs emNAHR
In deciding on a development con
tract with IBM twenty years ago this 
October, Carnegie Mellon reaped 
plenty of publicity and captured the 
curious attention of universities 
around the country, including technology-focused MIT and Stanford. 
They were just two institutions of 
roughly 25 at the time who were con
sidering forming a sort of CarnegieMellon-watching coalition, as an 
investment into the future of comput
ing and technology in higher educa
tion.
The Andrew project caught a 
wave, and kind of set an example of 
how to wire up a campus, says Peter 
Lee, a computer science professor 
and associate dean of undergraduate 
education. That was incredibly
influential... now you cant go to any 
decent university in the world and 
not find an influence from the 
Andrew Project there.
The University was a leader, taking 
on a project that most other institu
tions hadnt even thought about yet. 
Jim Morris, the dean of the School of 
Computer Science, says that while 
Carnegie Mellon was grappling with 
the problem of creating a distributed 
file system on the largest microcom
puter network ever, other schools 
made the relatively conservative 
decision of purchasing non-networked personal machines  a safe 
move that provided universities with 
the user-friendliness of an Apple 
computer, for example, without the 
connectivity of a campus network.
The reward for the huge invest
ment was perceived to be small, says 
Lee, and of course they were dead 
wrong, but you couldnt blame any
one for not realizing that, from that 
era.
Groundbreaking as the develop
ment efforts were, the sheen of bril
liance couldnt last forever. Today, 
personal computer networks are a 
given at most universities and the 
presence of computers and comput
ing technology on campus is taken 
for granted  there isnt a university 
out there without a website or that 
doesnt supply its students with email 
capabilities.

Lobster Boy interrupted, 
may resume after break
by Nick Ennis
GAupptRNAaR
Carnegie Mellon students might 
be surprised to know that William 
Kofmehl III (a.k.a. Lobster Boy) 
could be again pursuing his art 
project next semester. The 
University has offered senior art 
major Kofmehl space behind the 
Purnell Center on which to rebuild 
a structure to finish his controver
sial art project. Kofmehl is expect
ed to announce his decision on the 
offer this week.
According to Janet Stocks, direc
tor of the Undergraduate Research 
Initiative (URI), Kofmehl initially 
proposed to create an artistic piece 
that would explore the effect of his 
daytime silence on his nighttime 
utterances. Additionally, Kofmehl 
was to design and construct a 
3,000 square foot structurallysound building from scrap wood 
on the north side of Doherty Hall.
He was forced to abandon his 
project when he broke his silence 
after twelve males reportedly 
attempted to break into the struc
ture. Four of these men, all broth
ers of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, 
were issued citations for disorderly 
conduct and criminal mischief by 
Campus Police. Though Kofmehl 
could not be reached, his project 
advisor said he planned to use the 
building for other reasons through 
June 2003, to film approximately 
20 minutes of a film that he has 
been working on for the past three 
years. Also, he hoped to hold meet
ings and lectures as well as display 
artwork there.
Some students are supportive of 
Kofmehl and have found his art 
project intriguing.
It is close-minded to destroy 
things that you dont understand, 
said Adam Grossi, a junior art stu
dent. However, Grossi also said 
that Kofmehl should have made a 
public statement of his intentions 
to the campus community to pre
vent such happenings.
Not long after Kofmehl broke his 
silence, the University was notified 
that the structure was a fire hazard 
to nearby Doherty Hall. Also, the 
University said that Kofmehl could 
not use the building as a residence 
because CMU Environmental 
Health and Safety didnt approve 
it.
The issue was moot at that 
point since his project had already 
been interrupted, said Susanne 
Slavick, head professor of the 
School of Art.
She said that Kofmehl had 
assured her that he had not been 
living in the structure. However, 
she did indicate that civil engineerSee LOBSTER, page A4

Speaker has 
close relations 
to committee
by Andrew Johnson
datn emNAHR
At a university with as few students 
as Carnegie Mellon, the paths of 
involved students become tangled. 
The recent process of selecting a stu
dent com
mencement TVT 
speaker J^| 0WS 
highlights 
the conflicts 
of interest
that occur in such a compact commu
nity.
Jeff Walch, a fifth year senior in sci
ence and arts, who is a community 
advisor (CA), a brother of the Phi 
Kappa Theta fraternity, and head of 
the Think Out Loud project for this 
years Meeting of the Minds, will 
speak at commencement ceremony in 
May.
Senior social and decision sciences 
major Chad Altman, a Phi Kap broth
er and CA; senior design major 
Behnam Farahpour, a Phi Kap broth
er, and head designer for Think Out 
Loud; and Susan Eitelman, also a 
CA, comprised the student part of the 
committee that eventually selected 
Walch, which also included two 
house fellows and a faculty advisor.
In the case of commencement, it is 
not strange that Walchs brothers and 
fellow CAs sat the committee.
Brian Curfman, house fellow and 
head of the committee, said that the 
original intention was to find stu
dents who had no connection to the 
students, with special emphasis on 
fifth-year scholars.
This plan fell through, says 
Curfman, so he instead appealed to 
the Office of Student Affairs for a list 
of possible candidates, and in the 
end, expedience decided the makeup 
of the committee.
There were three peoples sched
ules that fit very nicely, said 
Curfman.
No evidence suggests the commit
tee makeup is an example of collu
sion.
The candidates offered by the 
Office of Student Affairs walk the 
same circles, and are often involved 
in a variety of community activities 
together.
Chad Hermann, the communicatons professor who served as faculty 
representation on the committee, and 
who had helped coach the previous 
years comencement speaker, 
reached his own conclusions about 
the speaker.
Jeff was the only speaker who 
made me feel anything, said 
Hermann. The other speeches were 
nice, fine exercises in thought and 
style, but Jeffs was the only one that 
seemed to have a real emotional 
kick.
During the spring semesters stu
dent government elections, Neil 
Hunt, a close acquaintance of the 
newly-elected student body president 
Brian Namey, was head of the elec
tions board.
This past Carnival, Katie Warren, a 
Kappa Alpha Theta sister, presided 
over the Midway booth competition 
as chair, while her sorority competed 
in it.
In the case of the Booth competi
tion, the same conflict occurs every 
year.
The members of the committee 
offer a variety of answers on how to 
handle these possible conflicts of 
interest that arise due to the relative
ly small network of students interest
ed in things like student government, 
community advising, and Greek life. 
From the members of the council at 
the center of the most recent exam
ple, a variety of answers to this ques
tion are offered.
I think it would be ideal if the 
committee knew no one, said Walch.
Altman thought that the check on 
involvement with one another is that

German gunmans 
motive was revenge
ERFURT, Germany (AP)  The 
teenager who gunned down 16 teach
ers and classmates at his former 
school in a furious rampage that hor
rified Germany was seeking revenge 
for being expelled after forging a doc
tors note, police said Saturday.
The assailant, identified by stu
dents as 19-year-old Robert
Steinhaeuser, marched through the 
schools halls Friday wearing a mask 
and armed with a pistol and a pumpaction shotgun, firing on teachers 
and students. He killed 16 people, 
including 13 teachers.
The rampage apparently ended 
when a teacher ripped off
Steinhaeusers mask and pushed him 
into a classroom, police spokesman 
Achim Kellner said. Startled, 
Steinhaeuser locked himself in the 
room, then shot himself some time 
later as police commandos entered 
the school.
Authorities believe Steinhaeusers 
motive was revenge: The gun enthu
siast was angry over being kicked out 
of school recently after faking a doc
tors note in an attempt to avoid final 
exams, Kellner said.
Police said they found about 500 
rounds of ammunition near the 
killers body and later found another 
500 at his familys apartment in the 
eastern city of Erfurt. Steinhaeuser 
was a member of two gun clubs in the 
city.
This was an act of revenge, 
Kellner said. He could not say exactly 
when Steinhaeuser was expelled.
He was generally not a diligent 
student, he liked to skip classes, 
Kellner said.
Bernhard Vogel, governor of 
Thuringia state, said Saturday that 
the gunman had targeted teachers. 
In many cases, the victims were shot 
in the head. He clearly was a trained 
marksman, he said.
By early Saturday, authorities were 
removing bodies from the Johann 
Gutenberg Gymnasium school in 
Erfurt. A memorial service is planned 
for next Friday, Vogel said.
Mourners gathered on a grassy 
area in front of the school that police 
had roped off to keep camera crews 
out. As the sun broke through the 
clouds after the previous days rain, 
couples held hands and friends com
forted each other.
A huge mound of flowers  tulips,
roses, sunflowers, lilies  flowed 
down the steps of the schools front 
entrance, near a handwritten note 
left by the children of Birgit Dietz, 
one of the slain teachers.
Mama, I love you. I always have 
and I always will, even though youve 
been taken away, the note read.
A former schoolmate, Isabell 
Hartung, described Steinhaeuser as 
intelligent and well-liked by his peers, 
but said he often fought with teachers 
and had bad relations with his par
ents.
Hartung said Steinhaeuser once 
told her: One day, I want everyone to 
know my name, and I want to be 
famous.
The gunman had obtained his 
weapons legally and had no criminal 
record, Manfred Scherer, a state secu
rity official, told a news conference. 
The assailants mother told police she 
saw no unusual behavior in her son 
before Fridays massacre.
Erfurt is a city of about 200,000 
located in former communist East 
Germany. The school, housed in a 
stately, turn-of-the-century building, 
has a high academic reputation, with 
about 700 students in grades five 
through 12.
Fighting near Kabul 
kills at least seven
GARDEZ, Afghanistan (AP)  
After a four-month lull, a vicious out
break of factional fighting in a key 
city south of Kabul left at least seven 
dead and 50 others wounded, a doc
tor at a Gardez hospital said Sunday.
Edgy residents in Gardez began to 
emerge from shuttered dwellings to 
check the damage Sunday, and work
ers at the hospital swept up broken 
glass from the previous days fighting.
At noon we had a war, said Dr. 
Naqibullah Irfan, speaking of the 
fighting Saturday. The forces of war
lord Bacha Kahn Zardaran fired rock
ets into the city for about four hours, 
he said.
Aminullah, an assistant to 
Governor Taj Mohammed Wardak, 
said he understood that as many as 
25 people were killed, including in 
the villages outside Gardez where the 
shelling started.
According to Islamic tradition, 
many families bury bodies immedi
ately without taking them to hospi
tals first.
Aminullah  who like many 
Afghans uses only one name  said 
15 of the most seriously injured were 
taken to Kabul, and that two of those 
had died.

Motorycle gangs 
clash at NV casino
LAUGHLIN, Nev. (AP)  Fighting 
erupted between motorcycle gangs at 
a casino early Saturday, and hospital 
authorities said at least nine people 
were shot or stabbed. A radio station 
reported four people were killed, 
though police would not immediately 
confirm that.
About 100 people were taken into 
custody and bridges over the 
Colorado River were shut to traffic, 
radio station KGMN-FM in Kingman, 
Arizona, reported.
The shooting occurred on the first 
floor of Harrahs during the 20th 
annual River Run, a large gathering 
of motorcycle clubs that brought up 
to 80,000 people into the gambling 
resort this weekend, said Larry 
Tunforss, a spokesman for the 
Bullhead City, Arizona, Fire 
Department.
Harrahs director of marketing, 
Laura De La Cruz, said an altercation 
between rival motorcycle gang mem
bers erupted shortly after 2 am. She 
would not give any other details, 
referring questions to police.
'Rinforss described the city as being 
in total lockdown. Nobody can drive 
in or out of the city, he said.
He said about 100 people inside the 
casino were either handcuffed or 
spread eagled on the floor by police 
after the shooting.
Police dispatchers would only con
firm a motorcycle gang was involved.
At Western Arizona Regional 
Medical Center in nearby Bullhead 
City, Arizona, nine male patients, 
some with gunshot wounds, some 
with knife stab wounds, were being 
treated, said hospital spokeswoman 
Ruth Padilla.
The hospital began receiving 
patients about 2:25 am, she said. 
Three men in critical condition with 
gunshot wounds were flown to
University Medical Center in Las 
Vegas, she said.
Laughlin is located 80 miles south
east of Las Vegas, near the Arizona

Engineer says sun 
helped cause crash
PLACENTIA, Calif. (AP)  The 
engineer of a freight train that 
slammed head-on into a commuter 
train told investigators he didnt see a 
yellow light warning him to slow 
down because he was blinded by the 
sun, police said.
The collision between a 67-car 
Burlington Northern Santa Fe train 
and a Metrolink train Tuesday morn
ing killed two people and injured 
more than 150.
The signal meant engineer Darrell 
Wells should have reduced speed to 
30 mph and prepared to stop. 
Investigators have said the train kept 
speeding up and reached 48 mph.
Wells told me he could not see the 
signal ... that the sun was very 
bright, police officer Kelly Kenehan 
wrote in his report.
Wells, 48, told Kenehan that after 
he was unable to make out the color 
of the signal, he reduced speed to 
about 40 mph until he could spot the 
next signal.
Then the engineer saw a Metrolink 
train on the same track and two red 
signal lights that indicated he should 
stop.
Wells knew he would not be able 
to stop in time and he and [conductor 
Dean E.] Tacoronte were going to col
lide with the Metrolink train, accord
ing to Kenehans report.
Both crew members jumped from 
the train.
Metrolink engineer Michael 
Dudgeon said he was proceeding nor
mally when I saw headlights and 
ditch lights and I then placed the 
train in emergency [stop] immediate
ly without hesitation.
Federal accident investigators have 
found no problems with the railroad 
signals, tracks, or equipment.

 After nearly two months of

Rendell has slight 
edge over Casey
The race for the Democratic nomi
nation for Pennsylvania governor is a 
close affair as the May 21 primary 
grows near.
A Pennsylvania poll gives Ed 
Rendell a five percent lead over Bob 
Casey, with Rendell projected to cap
ture 45 percent of the vofe.
The telephone poll was conducted 
by the cNAAnbyRsf cHnA.,uqaAAaJ who 
hired the Mason-Dixon Polling & 
Research agency.
According to the cHnA.,uqaAAaJ 
Rendells advantage lies with his high 
popularity in Philadelphia, where he 
has served as district attorney and 
mayor, and thus captured 74 percent 
of the surveyed populations votes.
Casey, who is in his second term as ' 
auditor general of Pennsylvania, has 
captured the majority of the votes in 
every other region, but the margins 
are much slimmer than the 
Philadelphia consensus.
The survey also showed a rift in 
opinion between male and female 
voters.
Men favored Casey by a margin of 
45 percent to Rendells 42 percent. 
Women tended to favor Rendell 47 
percent to 36 percent.
One factor that may contribute to 
the discrepancy is Caseys support of 
increased abortion restriction as 
opposed to Rendells support of abor
tion rights.
Adult theater fights 
city in costly case
The Garden Theater may go down 
but not without a fight, and a costly 
one at that.
The City of Pittsburgh has fought; 
for the last five years to close the last 
adult theater in Pittsburgh, owned by 
George Androtsakis.
The owner has waged quite a legal 
battle with city officials, having1 
racked up $500,000 in legal fees. The 
City of Pittsburgh, through the urban 
Redevelopment Effort, has already 
paid one of Pittsburghs top firms, 
Reed Smith $548,000 in pursuing its 
case for demolition.
Last week, Allegheny County 
Common pleas Judge Alan Penkower' 
ruled thet the city could take the the
ater by eminent domain, but 
Androtsakis appealed the ruling to 
Commonwealth Court.
Androtsakis attorney, Peter 
Georgiades, claims that the City 
ignored First and Fifth amendmentrights, since plans for the Theater 
includes overhauling it for continued" 
use.
The URA contends, however, that 
the taking of the property had noth
ing to do with the content of the 
entertainment there, but rather 
because it was needed since it was 
located in the middle of an eightblock redevelopment project called 
Federal North.
Parts of the project that have 
already been completed include an 
office building and a parking garage.
The case could last for several more 
years, since the Commonwealth 
Court may take as long as two years 
to finally rule on the appeal just filed.

Man seeks bags 
in baggage chute
MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  A 
Hicksville, New York, man was 
arrested Thursday night at Miami 
International Airport after alleged
ly crawling along a moving 
carousel into a secure baggage 
holding area in search of his lug

awaiting his luggage when he 
apparently decided to speed the 
process.
Security called the police, who

Coughing scam

LONDON (AP)  A fourth per

police said Saturday.
The 35-year-old man, whose 
name was not released, was taken 
into custody Wednesday by police 
in western England, Scotland Yard 
said.
Police declined to discuss what 
role he may have played in the 
alleged scam. He was released on 
bail pending a June court hearing.
Police have arrested three oth
ers as part of the investigation into 
a segment of the popular show in 
which Major Charles Ingram, 38, 
won 1 million pounds, or $1.45 
million.
The segment was not broadcast 
and Ingrams check was withheld 
because of suspicions that he 
cheated.
News reports suggested investi
gators believed someone in the 
audience relayed correct answers 
to questions by coughing.
Ingram and his wife Diana, 37, 
were arrested at their home in 
Wiltshire county, west of London, 
in November and are free on bail. 
A teacher identified in press 
reports as Tecwen Whittock was 
also arrested.
None of the three has been 
charged, Scotland Yard said, 
adding that the investigation was 
continuing.
Diana Ingram and the majors 
brother-in-law, Adrian Pollock, 
had both previously won $45,000 
on the game show.
She later wrote a book called 
FNE C rN((NHE based on a theory 
both she and her brother had used 
to succeed.
After the inquiry was 
announced, Ingram held a news 
conference and denied any wrong
doing.

Survey shows low 
condom usage
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH  
According to a survey done by 
University of Pittsburghs Student 
Health Services last spring, 40 per
cent of Pitt students admit to never 
using condoms. But students arent 
necessarily aware of these numbers: 
three percent of those surveyed 
thought that the typical student at 
Pitt never uses a condom.
In order to raise awareness about 
the importance of having safe sex, 
Pitts Student Health Services offers 
two types of sexual education pro
grams, according to Mary Hurm, 
the departments sexual health edu
cator.
The outreach program is the larg
er of the two and is targeted mainly 
at first-year students. Hurm said 
that the programs are given primar
ily to Freshmen Studies classes, fra
ternities, and sororities. The main 
goal of the outreach program is to 
inform students about the causes of 
sexually transmitted diseases and 
the treatment options.
We seem to be getting a good 
response from the outreach pro
grams, Hurm said. Im not sure if 
they take the advice, but theyre 
receptive at the time.
Student Health also offers private 
counseling for people who have 
questions and concerns or simply 
need someone to talk to.
In addition to these two pro
grams, Hurm said that Student 
Health is in the process of develop
ing a program that is more appro
priate for upper-level students. 
Topics that may be included are bet
ter approaches to saying no and 
options for sexually transmitted dis
eases.
While HIV and the AIDS virus are 
the sexually transmitted diseases 
most frequently associated with 
campaigns encouraging safe sex, 
college students are also at risk of 
contracting a number of less wellknown problems. Chlamydia, geni
tal herpes, genital warts, gonor
rhea, and syphilis are all most 
prevalent in people ages 20-24. 
Education is the first step Student 
Health utilizes to keep students 
safe.
Shirley Haoerman, Pitts director 
of Student Health, said, We try to
promote a balanced, healthy life on 
campus. This includes sexual health 
as well.
The pharmacy at Student Health 
services offers a number of birth con
trol devices at discounted rates to 
make protection more accessible to 
students. For example, a box of 
Lifestyles condoms with spermicidal 
lubricant costs $3 at the Student 
Health pharmacy. The same box of 
condoms costs $10.99 at the local 
Rite Aid.
Along with condoms, a number of 
alternative forms of protection, 
including birth control pills and sper
micidal lubricants, can also be bought 
at a discount.
The best advice that I can give to a 
sexually active student, Hurm said, 
is to use condoms every time, and if 
you have had unprotected sex, get 
tested for any STDs.
Besides testing and proper protec
tion, abstinence and monogamy are 
other options for birth control and 
the prevention of sexually transmit
ted diseases. In Student Healths sur
vey, 49 percent of Pitt students 
reported having had one or fewer sex
ual partners.

William Strickland Jr., a University 
of Pittsburgh alumnus, is slated to be 
Pitts commencement speaker this 
year.

Cohon addresses 
recent racial issues
Last Thursday, an individual drew 
a swastika in black marker on the 
front of the Jewish University Center 
on Forbes Avenue near Craig Street.
In response to the hate crime and 
local incidents correlated with the 
crisis in the Middle East, University 
President Jared Cohon issued a letter 
expressing concern over the line 
between expressing students views 
and harassment. The president 
addressed the vandalism, conflict 
between students over the Middle 
East, and hateful emails sent to mem
bers of the Black Graduate Student 
Organization in January.
Unfortunately, there have been a 
few incidents where the level of dis
course has been, at best, uncivil, 
wrote Cohon. We must all work indi
vidually and collectively to ensure 
that we do not engage in  or con
done  such behavior.
The perpetrator of the vandalism 
was captured on surveilance tape and 
is described as white male in his early 
t 20s, 5'9", 190 lbs., of stocky build, 
and has a shaved head. He is said to 
frequent the area of Forbes Avenue 
and South Craig Street.
Town meetings on 
campus continue
On Wednesday April 24, 2002, 
President Cohon held a Town 
Meeting for the students, faculty, and 
staff of Carnegie Mellon. He acknowl
edged every question sent to him and 
asked of him at the meeting. Within 
the questions asked, five major issues 
arose. These were security on cam
pus, the future of the fraternity quad
rangle, the green movement on cam
pus, the recruiting of domestic 
minorities, and if the fact-gathering 
process of The Tartan could be
screened in anyway.
Cohon addressed security mainly 
as a result of the robbery on Beeler 
Street during Spring Carnival week-r 0 
end, and the numerous break-ins of 
offices in Baker Hall. ~ <

THE TARTAN  APRIL 29, 2002
Carnegie Mellon considers implications of technology on the state of cheating
CHEATING, from page A1
as changing variable names and adding redun
dant lines of code. In addition, the program 
searches the Internet for known code and 
checks to see if it has been duplicated.
Lee says that he now regrets the move. 
There is a presumption of guilt, says Lee. He 
adds that there was no notification that the pro
gram would be run. Afterwards, Lee and Bill 
Scherlis, who co-taught the course, sent a noti
fication to the course bboard asking students to 
step out and admit their guilt. Lee says that was 
a mistake too.
It made everyone in the class feel bad and 
feel hunted. The professors received around 
70 emails from students that said they had 
thought they might have cheated because they 
collaborated on the assignment, even though 
what many admitted to was not considered 
cheating.
What kind of did upset me is that it dragged 
on for as long as it did. It should have been dealt 
with and resolved. The process of dealing with 
it started to interfere with the class, said Calvin 
Ashmore, a sophomore computer science major 
who took the course.
Lee and Scherlis met individually with each 
student who was suspected of cheating individ
ually for an hour, and punishments were hand
ed down on a case-by-case basis. Since the inci
dent happened before the course drop dead
line, some students were asked to drop the 
class.
Others were given no credit for the assign
ment and in some cases some students received 
no punishment. Student Affairs was notified 
but no further action was taken.
Jay Kadane, a professor in statistics, headed a 
task force on academic integrity a few years 
ago. He feels Lee was justified in his actions, 
and was in fact fulfilling his responsibility as a 
faculty member. It seems to me he did exactly 
the right thing, says Kadane. You must keep 
the playing field level for all students.
A Fine Line
Lee suggests that CMU might be at one 
extreme of the collaboration spectrum, where 
teamwork and learning from each other is 
expected and encouraged, whereas a University 
like Georgia Tech is at the other. At Tech, repli
cating an answer on an exam a TA previously 
gave in class is considered cheating. Drawing 
the line between cheating and collaboration 
can often be difficult.
In the wake of the Georgia Tech scandal, a 
survey conducted by students at Georgia Tech 
entitled Causes for Cheating: Unclear
Expectations in the Classroom, by Andy 
Ozment, Alison Smith, and Wendy Newstetter 
addressed the question of what students, TAs, 
and faculty thought was defined by cheating. In 
it participants from the three groups were 
asked hypothetical questions to assess what 
they considered cheating in a computer science 
programming course. The results showed that 
the first difficulty in studying cheating is defin
ing it.... The results further indicated a need for 
clear leadership in the definition of which 
actions and behaviors constitute cheating, 
stated the report.
In 15-211 there was a lot of education as to
this is cheating this is not cheating. 
Sometimes things that what I would not consid
er cheating were, said Ashmore. .
At CMU, the faculty members largely deter
mine where to draw the line between cheating 
and collaboration. Lee says that if a student has 
copied code in any form, he must draw the line 
there, even if the student did not feel he was 
cheating. Kadane has a policy in his classes 
which indicates that students must disclose col
laboration with others on an assignment. In the 
cases that he finds over-collaboration and there 
is no such disclosure, he notifies the student of 
possible disciplinary action. Kadane adds that 
when in doubt about cheating, it is the stu
dents responsibility to ask the professor.
Sharon Dilworth, a professor in the English 
department, says she once caught a student 
cheating and was surprised at his defense. The 
student had turned in a short story that his 
friend said was unpublished and had sent him. 
Unfortunately the work was published and was 
by one of Dilworths favorite authors. The stu
dent said that he didnt consider it cheating 
because his friend had sent it to him. It was 
interesting to me because he really didnt 
understand the definition of plagiarism, said 
Dilworth.
The 15-211 discovery prompted a lot of dis
cussion within the computer science depart
ment as to what should be done to address 
cheating. One conclusion was that every facul
ty member has a different concept of what 
cheating is. There is still debate on how to deal 
with the problem, says Lee. He doubts that 
there will be a department-wide policy on it or 
that the similarity checker will be a require
ment, but instead would continue to be left up 
to the instructors.
And some students are wary of a forced simi
larity checker on all CS assignments. I guess I 
would understand why they were doirig that, 
but I wouldnt like it, said David Camillus, a 
sophomore computer science major who took 
15-211 last semester. My gut response is that it 
indicates a lack of trust.
Punishment and Process
As part of the academic integrity taskforce, 
Kadane and his committee looked at the post
cheating process. Currently, faculty members 
who identify a case must notify the student, 
department and college heads, and the Student 
Affairs office. Usually minor offenses result in a 
course-level action, such as a failing grade. 
Faculty members decide on the punishment 
based on contact with the student. A secondlevel review can occur when a student appeals a 
decision, the Dean of Student Affairs decides to 
conduct one (such as in the case of repeat 
offenses), or a faculty member recommends a 
more severe punishment than that afforded at 
the course-level. An academic review board is 
convened which consists of a panel of commu
nity members including students, administra
tion, and faculty. There the student and faculty 
member can present their case. On this level 
punishments can range from dropping a course 
grade, to suspension, or even expulsion.
I think the process that we have is a good 
one when utilized, said Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy. I think it is an issue 
for all community members  of holding each
other accountable.
In 1994 the process was publically criticized 
by professor Jim Hoburg, who caught one of his 
students altering a test after it was graded and 
bringing it to the professor for a point change. 
The student was initially found guilty but was 
later exonerated after appealing the case. 
Murphy says he will not discuss or comment on 
individual cases, but says that since then, there 
has been an effort to find a better cross-section 
of members for the academic review boards, 
although the process remains the same.
Kadane says he also feels the process is 
sound. Rather, he says the problem may lie 
more with faculty members not using the 
process correctly or actively looking for cheat
ing that does occur.
A New Breed of Cheater
I suppose one question is what are the vari
ous ways in which students cheat? asks 
Kadane.
Over the years, the main method of cheating 
has involved some form of plagiarism, whether 
it be on a homework assignment, a final paper, 
or an exam. Students have developed some 
intricate ways of cheating, too. One student, 
who wishes to remain anonymous, said that he 
has witnessed something known as the 
Singaporean V where the two smartest stu
dents sit at the front of a class with students 
flanking them on either side up to four levels, 
forming a triangular shape. The idea is for stu
dents to be able to look over each others shoul
ders and disseminate correct answers for exam 
questions.
Jennifer Church, who has seen most of the 
academic integrity cases that have passed 
through Student Affairs over the last six years, 
says that the main trend she has noticed is stu
dents using technology more to cheat.
One student said that he knows of some stu
dents that use graphing calculators to cheat on 
exams. For true/false questions, a 1 is used to 
indicate true and a 0 for false and the calculator 
is passed around.
The Internet allows students to find all kinds 
of information, from snippets of code to full
blown papers.
Programs exist that match student papers 
against search results on the Internet. I have 
actually caught students plagiarizing using 
Google, simply typing in suspicious-sounding 
language, language that doesnt seem written 
in their normal writing voice or style, as part of 
a Google search and matching on Internet texts 
from which the student copied, said David 
Kaufer, a professor of English and head of the 
department.
At some universities there are standard pro
grams used to filter student papers, but at CMU 
there is no such standard.
Cheating  A rampant problem?
Just based on classes that Ive been in I get 
the impression that this [type of cheating] is 
fairly standard behavior. This is just one of the 
first times that it was checked for with such an 
accurate tool, says Brian Goodman, a teaching 
assistant for 15-211 last semester.
Over the years, the number of academic 
review cases has declined, but Church says to 
be wary of the numbers, as policies have
changed over time as well. It used to be that 
more first-offense cases saw a meeting and 
were not dealt with by faculty. It is impossible 
to say how much students cheat, but some feel 
that it is a significant enough problem that it 
requires some further discussion.
I think cheating is quite rampant right now, 
says Prem Ramaswami, a sophomore who has 
raised the issue recently at the University 
Student Advisory Council (USAC). I think an 
honor code should basically say that people will 
hold themselves to a high level of moral and 
ethical standards. It should say that they will 
not cheat nor will they cause harm to anyone 
else.
Currently, the University has a Carnegie 
Mellon code which states the standards stu
dents are expected to follow when it comes to 
academic integrity: Creativity cannot exist 
without acknowledgement of the creativity of 
others. New knowledge cannot be developed 
without credit for prior knowledge. It contin
ues, Students who cannot meet [these stan
dards] should voluntarily withdraw from the 
university.
Other universities, such as the University of 
Virginia, have similar codes but ask students to 
sign to it. In addition, the burden of detecting 
cheating is left to the students, not just the fac
ulty. Students sign a statement indicating that 
they will not cheat and they will report students 
that are violating the code. There has been some 
discussion over the years as to whether such an 
honor code should exist at CMU.
Ramaswami says he is personally against a 
student reporting clause. In most situations, 
you can never be truly sure if someone else is 
cheating; its mere speculation on your part. 
Even in cut and dry cases, my personal belief is 
that the person will either get caught at some 
point, or things will catch up to them. I do not 
see any purpose in causing that person any 
harm.
Other students agree, but dont even feel like 
signing an honor code would do much to help 
the cheating problem.
I think having students signing a code is not 
going to make a difference as to how students 
act, says Ashmore.
Others, however, feel it might help. Ive 
copied homework on occasion, said an anony
mous student. I only feel bad if its related to 
my major. The student says that he feels like 
signing a code might help. I think it makes a 
statement.
The signed honor code issue is still under dis
cussion. Church says that there is no active 
effort to implement one from Student Affairs, 
but that she and others are still concerned 
about finding a better way to communicate the 
message to students.
One possibility includes posting the current 
CMU Code in public places so students are more 
aware of it. Lee says that he feels that it is up to 
faculty to educate their students, especially the 
younger ones who might not have a good idea 
of what cheating is. There is nothing worse 
than a faculty member having to confront a stu
dent for bad behavior, said Lee as he sat in his 
office, reflecting on the 20 hours of meetings he 
had to go through, some wrought with tears. 
Its just so much more fun to spend time mak
ing students successful.
Art project

LOBSTER, from page A1
ing professor Larry Cartwright 
had checked over the design of the 
structure to ensure that it would 
be structurally safe.
The University is incredibly 
supportive of [Kofmehls] project 
given the number of needs it has 
to balance, said Slavick.
Following the response to 
Kofmehls project, URI amended 
its approval process to include a 
review by both Facilities 
Maintenance Service (FMS) and 
Environmental Health and Safety 
(EHS). New proposals will have to 
be approved by both agencies 
before receiving funding, and 
Kofmehl has filed a new proposal 
in accordance with this change.
Though his project has met 
many unforeseen obstacles, 
Kofmehl is considering continuing 
it at another location. FMS and 
EHS have approved a site on the 
hillside behind the Purnell Center. 
The slope will pose a problem 
though, because of the difficulty 
in building a sound foundation 
there. Kofmehl has expressed a 
desire for an area behind Donner 
House. Both of Kofmehls parents 
have supported him in his efforts. 
William Kofmehl Junior, his 
father, said that he has received 
dozens of positive comments from 
neighbors in his West View neigh
borhood where Kofmehl grew up.
The project has many layers of 
meaning. At even the most basic 
level, the engineering of the struc
ture should be commended, said 
Kofmehls father.
He also said that the longer the 
project is postponed, the more dif
ficult it will be for his son to be 
able to complete it. Kofmehls 
father added that though the 
University has shown its support, 
everything is still up in the air and 
all parties involved are waiting for 
issues to resolve themselves. He 
does not think a hillside location is 
appropriate since it will be nearly 
impossible for Kofmehl to con
struct a sound foundation and 
revise his design to accommodate 
the slope.
I am anxious for the issue to be 
resolved, said Robert Bingham, 
Kofmehls faculty advisor.
Like Bingham, Slavick and the 
Kofmehl family would like to see a 
final decision on the project 
reached soon.
School of Computer Science plans for new project
COMPUTERS, from page A1
For the past 15 years, colleges have been 
wiring up their campuses. Right now were 
in an era where all the campuses are just 
about done with that, says Lee.
I think its in some ways been boring up 
until now. Digital technologies are just 
entering our lives now, says Morris.
To get a sense of what he is saying, con
sider the past few years: the broadening 
appeal of personal computers, which func
tion as word processors, libraries, chess 
boards, entertainment centers, and simula
tors of bloodletting mayhem. Then look 
around and notice all the handheld com
puters, PDAs, MP3 players, and cell phones 
that have invaded daily life, and its clear 
that computers have already staked a per
manent claim in society.
In recent years Carnegie Mellon hasnt 
received the same sort of attention for its 
computer science exploits that it did two 
decades ago, when The Wall Street Journal 
stated that perhaps the University was 
eager to become Computer U.  in light of 
the IBM deal. But this is likely because the 
medium is no longer novel, as it once was.
The projects that we were doing 20 
years ago were the kind of projects that 
involved creating a capability that did not 
previously exist, says Bill Scherlis, a pro
fessor and principal researcher in the 
School of Computer Science. On the other 
hand, the concepts and applications being 
researched today may not receive big media 
coverage, but are still far-reaching and 
potentially revolutionary.
Theres a lot going on that has tremen
dous impact that doesnt have buzz, 
Scherlis adds.
With a steady flow of computer technolo
gy and research development, SCSs faculty 
and administrators feel the capability exists 
for further advancement.
The electronic plumbing has definitely 
been put in, says Morris. Were working 
on that much harder problem of how to 
make that content useful and accessible to 
people.
But what Morris is really sayfng is that 
now the world is ready, and the time is 
becoming ripe for something big. And that 
plumbing will serve what may be the next 
big thing: Andrew Information Space, a 
project that, on paper, has huge potential to 
change the way higher education is 
approached in the future.
The Andrew Information Space (AIS) is 
our vision for ... an integrated, universitywide knowledge management system for 
educational resources, reads a proposal 
dated last July, drafted by a task force head
ed by Joel Smith, vice provost of Computing
Services.
The project approaches computers as an 
integral element in the lives of students, 
and will attempt to change the way learn
ing occurs while preserving the critical per
sonal relationships that exist now among 
students, faculty, staff, and teaching assis
tants.
The AIS project will pursue a goal of 
enabling students to access all the elements 
of their education  class and lecture 
notes, course outlines, problem sets, 
quizzes, exams, assessment tools, and more
 throughout the course of their college 
careers, and for life afterwards. The result 
would be a giant pool of knowledge with 
which students and professors could learn 
from each other, related classes could pool 
resources, and alumni could become inte
grated into the intellectual culture of the 
University.
The project is being explored in conjunc
tion with members of the philosophy and 
psychology departments, who will provide 
expertise on aspects of education and 
learning.
It represents a coordinated effort among 
departments, and displays what Scherlis 
calls the genuinely successful model for 
interdisciplinary research within the 
School of Computer Science.
Many of the current efforts that the 
School of Computer Science is known for 
focus around the study of intelligence and 
knowledge, as well as the feasibility of 
dependable and usable systems. These pur
suits, including adequate funding, will be 
central to the success of the AIS, which as a 
University-wide data storage and educa
tional system, will require the most 
dependable, reliable, and impeccablydesigned infrastructure  at a reasonable 
price.
When youre talking about maintaining 
very complex data, youre talking about a 
level of cost-effective dependability that 
doesnt exist today, says Lee.
Scherlis is focusing his energies on devel
oping these systems  achieving a culture 
of dependability where it is actually appro
priate to have expectations of dependabili
ty for desktop software  and is also con
tributing to the work that NASA has 
encountered in wrestling with the same 
problem for future space missions.
The project is being planned as MIT 
nears its first checkpoint in its Open 
Courseware (OCW) initiative, which was 
announced last year and will give free webbased access to all course materials that the 
school owns. Lee says that MIT is the only 
other university besides Carnegie Mellon 
that has institutional commitment to the 
use of computers as a new tool for the dis
semination of knowledge to any user, any
where in the world.
Theyre very focused on high quality 
courseware as freely as possible, says Lee. 
But that availability is not the whole story. 
Lee emphasizes that the SCS project would 
focus on the communication and interac
tions that make a college education worth
while.
Presently, the AIS project is only in its 
infancy. But as far as project planning goes, 
there is a model: the Andrew project.
The current plan structurally is to go 
about it the same way, and what that means 
in general terms is that much of the funding 
thats raised would go towards a technolo
gy transfer organization, says Lee. It 
would take ideas in education, harden 
them, and then hand them over to academ
ic computing.
Major fundraising remains, as well as 
efforts to gather essential student input  
something that is invaluable not just 
because of the backlash received from stu
dents twenty years ago, when the IBM deal 
was announced after very little student par
ticipation, but also because of the potential 
that students, products of todays computer-culture, may possess in forming ideas.
Probably the biggest impediment for 
progress might be the fact that people are 
now living too long and the older people 
are still in control of things, says Morris. 
People who can just assume that you just 
get any answer from the Internet in some 
sense have a power that some people are 
amazed at and dont take for granted.
Faculty, in some sense, are clueless, 
says Lee.
As of now, the AIS project has been pre
sented to various department heads, inter
ested faculty, and the Presidents Council. 
The Hewlett Foundation, which with the 
Mellon Foundation funded the OCW pro
ject, has provided one-quarter of the fund
ing that the Andrew Information Space 
(AIS) project will require, says Lee, and the 
team will continue to make presentations in 
hopes of fulfilling their funding require
ments.
Morris emphasizes the schools compe
tence and leadership in the integration of 
computing technology and other disci
plines, such as psychology and philosophy. 
Because of these strengths, he believes that 
Carnegie Mellons next breakthrough 
should have something to do with learning 
and intelligence.
But no one can dismiss the motivating 
factor of competition.
Were always wanting to stay in the lead
 and some of this is driven by that, to be 
honest, says Lee. Everyone can sense 
theres a wave rising again.
Public display of budgets debated
JFC, from page A1
Government was not to release the line items 
to anybody. He expressed concern over the 
release of the numbers and the implications for 
some student organizations. Citing the exam
ples of booth- and buggy-building organiza
tions, he said that many of these organizations 
consider line items to be secret and essential to 
the success of the organization in competition.
By Saturday evening detailed line items, like 
those which could identify where money was 
being spent on a particular buggy, were gone. 
According to a post by Steenhuis on the 
Student Government Bboard, Until further 
discussion has been held, the JFC budgets are 
no longer on the Senate webpage given in a 
previous post. This was a decision of the JFC 
Chair.
Lane said that she authorized putting bud
gets online after certain members of the 
Executive Committee [of Student Senate] told 
her that placing the budgets online was proce
dure. She was later informed, according to 
Lane, that placing the line item budgets online 
was not procedure and proceeded to remove 
the line items from the online posting.
However, according to Steenhuis, There is 
no policy in student government about releas
ing [budgets]. Steenhuis said that those in
physical possession of the budgets  Student 
Body Treasurer Michael Sebetich, a junior 
information systems major, Lane, and staff 
assistant Marilyn Pipes of Student Activities  
were the people who could release the bud
gets. He said that release of the budgets was at 
their discretion as there is no policy governing 
their release. As a member of the legislative 
branch, we need to have a commitment to 
releasing information, said Steenhuis.
These sentiments appear to mirror the con
sensus of the administration. According to 
Jennifer Church, associate dean of Student 
Affairs, Student Activities does not have any 
objection with providing the budgets as 
approved by JFC.
She went on to say that the budgets are seen 
as public information and that Student 
Activities has no reason to prohibit student 
access to budgets containing approved line 
items.
However Namey said that, It is not true that 
budgets are available upon request. It has 
never been the case. For the near term, how
ever, it appears that the debate over budget 
release will continue. Every official contacted 
in Student Government agreed that it is time 
for an explicit, clear policy on the release of 
line item budgets to the general student popu
lation.

of interest in teaching through this 
form. But teaching a course is differ
ent, so we made sure that each stu
dent teacher has a faculty mentor to 
help them lead a course, and then we 
also verified the course through a 
proposal, said Stehlik.
When applying to teach a course, 
students are expected to complete a 
10-page application and proposal in 
which they outline the course sched
ule and explanation. The application 
is then evaluated with a faculty advi
sor and three other students. If all 
requirements are met, the course is 
accepted and evaluated two more 
times while they are teaching in 
attempts to solicit feedback from 
their students at the mid-year and 
final period.
> Applications for courses ranged 
from physical education classes such 
as Yoga and Figure Skating to 
Portuguese Language and Culture 
and Oscar Wilde. Because of the com
plexity of such topics, student teach
ers are also required to go to teaching 
workshops in which they learn differ
ent methods of teaching.
*- Some of it is stuff you already
know, but it gets you thinking, said 
Krista Pfaendler, a fifth-year scholar 
in biology.
Pfaendler is teaching a class called 
Subjects Your High School Health 
Class Didn't Cover. The teaching 
workshops help to get the student 
teachers syllabi straight, as well as 
introduce the teachers to the other 
classes and how and what they are 
teaching.
Nieves and Stehlik hope meticu
lous review will ensure that only 
legitimate courses are offered.
Senior computer science student 
Noble Shore is now teaching a Bridge 
class through Student College, a 
course he previously taught through 
physical education. A former teach
ing assistant in computer science, 
and certified as a bridge teacher by 
the American Contract Bridge 
League, Shore has brought his teach
ing experience with him, but 
nonetheless has gone through the 
application process and workshops.
This is a good opportunity for the 
student teaching to also learn how to 
teach, said Nieves. Overall I really 
believe that this will be a good expe
rience for all of the students 
involved.

COMMENCEMENT, from page A1
people tend to overcompensate for 
their personal bias.
I think people are subconsciously 
biased against people they are close 
with, said Altman.
And as Eitelman pointed out, 
They have a lot of leaders in [Phi 
Kappa Theta].
Regardless of the fact that Altman 
alone says he was close to maybe five 
of the possible candidates, nothing 
was done to consider the possible 
conflicts of interest that could arise 
when choosing from a pool of student 
leaders, or the implications of impro
priety that could spawn from a deci
sion in which the speaker was select
ed by two fellow community advisors 
and two fellow fraternity brothers.
One thing we do in the [business 
administration commencement 
speaker selection] is we personally 
interview each candidate. The down
side to that in the overall commencettient ceremony is the amount of 
applicants, said Herman.
Hermanns comment highlights 
the idea that a personal connection 
With a candidate can often influence 
peoples choices.
There was a consensus among the 
committee, that all personal relation
ships aside, Walch came in and gave 
the best speech.
The committee cited Walchs pre
paredness and the feeling he instilled 
in them as he spoke. Yet, the process 
of selecting the committee leaves lin
gering doubts as to the legitimacy of 
the selection.
Even Hermanns comment on the 
process of selection highlights a 
razors edge, that is the urge to judge 
a candidate somewhat for who they 
are while also not letting ones per
sonal bias give the candidate unfair 
advantage.
Altman related a story in which he 
attained a position at least partially 
based on his personal relationship 
with the hiring party.
This is a common occurence, some
times called networking, and 
taught as one of the keys to finding 
good employment.
The judgment of when this is 
appropriate and when the relation
ships need to be shelved is a tough 
decision to make.

Not just girls with goggles: sons and daughters visit CMU workplace
Courtesy of Nancy Klancher
' Girls try on UV-protective goggles in a biology lab on Take Your Daughters to Work 
 Day. A similar program followed for boys the next day.
by Kristin Lala
caRnHEEa( ruEusaR
Last Thursday and Friday, young 
girls and boys could be seen wander
ing about campus, nametags firmly 
planted on their shirts and official 
Carnegie Mellon folders in hand.
Despite appearances, the average 
age of prospective students isnt geting younger  the visitors were 
actually participants in the annual 
Take Our Daughters to Work pro
gram and CMUs first ever Take Our
Sons to Work program.
The concept of Take Our 
Daughters to Work Day was begun 
ten years ago by the Ms. Foundation, 
and was designed to expose young 
women between the ages of 9 and 15 
to positive role models in the work 
environment. Through the program, 
the Ms. Foundation targets females in 
an age range that is particularly at 
risk for low self-esteem, an unhealthy 
focus on physical appearance, and 
loss of academic goals. Coordinator 
of Student Development Michele 
Grab oversees student involvement in
the program and notes the reciprocal 
benefits between CMU volunteers 
and female participants. I think that 
it gives [CMU] students the chance to 
mentor the girls for the day and they 
really enjoy that, she said. I think it 
gives the girls the opportunities to see 
some things they dont usually see, 
like the Robotics Center or Purnell.
Maintaining the Ms. Foundations 
original focus on such gender-specific 
issues presented a particular chal
lenge to this years organizers as they 
incorporated a separate day for 
young males. This is our first year 
for having sons and I think the goals 
in some ways are the same. I am a 
proponent of keeping the days sepa
rate  we are trying to address gen
der issues in some ways, said 
Principal Software Engineer Brenda 
Graham.
Although many of the activities 
were identical, sons and daughters 
programs were held on different days 
to maintain the focus on children of 
the same gender working together in 
a more suited environment.
To see the way the kids respond 
differently is just amazing, Graham 
said. They gave them real-life Career 
Center problems to brainstorm, and 
the girls listened to each other and 
worked together and the boys were so 
task-oriented. Lots of critical thinking 
but [the males] didnt listen to each 
other. So you can imagine how girls 
in that environment would not fare as 
well.
Traditional parent-child time in the 
workplace was designated from 8:30 
to 11:45 am, when adults were 
encouraged to show the child what 
everyday life is like in their place of
employment and involve them in the 
job process whenever possible.
However, several workshops over
lapped with this time period, includ
ing a soccer skills workshop with 
womens coach Heather Kendra, a 
basketball workshop with mens 
coach Tony Wingen and a panel dis
cussion for older participants led by 
CMU students on college preparation 
and experiences. A morning SEI 
TV/Video Production workshop 
filled up quickly, as did Retail Shop 
Experience. On each day, partici
pants had the option of attending a 
$1 luncheon held in Rangos Hall with 
entertainment: Voices United Gospel 
Choir (VUGC), Classic Indian Dance 
with Monica Ullagaddi, and an a 
capella group for each day, the 
Soundbytes for the girls, and the 
Originals for the boys. From 12:30 to
4 pm, the programs consisted of short 
presentations on a variety of topics 
led by faculty, staff, and student vol
unteers.
Track topics included Rapid 
Design (a hands-on engineering 
workshop), What does an Architect 
do?, Back Stage (a behind-thescenes-look at CMU drama produc
tions), Intelligent Workplace, 
Healthy and Happy!, and African 
and Caribbean Dance. Sophomore 
math student Calvin Ashmore was 
one of the volunteers for the Jam-odrum track. In this activity, partici
pants collaborated to have a unique 
audiovisual experience through 
music and computer-graphics projec
tions. No musical experience was 
necessary to enjoy the Jam-o-drum, 
and Ashmore described the event as 
relatively unstructured: [The girls]
kind of just came in the room and 
started playing with it, and they 
didnt have any questions to start 
off with. We said, This is the pro
ject and were not going to tell you 
what its about, were going to let 
you play with it and figure it out. 
Junior physics major Susan Kost 
volunteered to lead girls to the var
ious stations, which included 
Generating Electric and 
Vanishing Points, Lines, and 
Horizons.
The events in each track encour
aged activity. It was very handson. There were demos, there was a 
solar power activity and [the girls] 
got to play with that. They got to 
draw with pencils or charcoal, 
Kost said. Kost described Carnegie 
Mellons Take Our Daughters to 
Work program as dissimilar to 
what she experienced years earlier 
with her own parent: It was very 
different from what we have now. 
Basically, I went to my moms office
 she works in the computer 
industry  and I kind of just sat in 
her office.
With this event, Kost said, I 
think the kids got more exposure to 
what their parents do and saw dif
ferent parts of the campus. 
Although Take Our Daughters to 
Work and Take Our Sons to 
Work programs were held on sep
arate days, the aims of each pro
gram are alike in many ways. A 
common goal for both days is to see 
role models of [participants] own 
gender doing a lot of different 
things, said Graham. [Adding] 
the boys day was about equity. I 
think we will continue to do both.

Do you have a quirky business 
idea that you think has much poten
tial but not enough money to launch 
it in the market? The Undergraduate 
Entrepreneurship Association 
(UEA) of CMU promotes entrepre
neurial thought and development at 
the undergraduate level. Through 
innovative workshops, lectures, and 
business plan competitions they 
educate students on building suc
cessful entrepreneurial endeavors. 
Their upcoming annual business 
plan competition highlights the 
most pioneering and original busi
ness opportunities that undergradu
ate students are developing at CMU. 
Through the help of sponsors and 
advisors students are awarded with 
a small amount of initial financing 
for creating the most opportunistic 
ventures.
Teams of undergraduate CMU 
students will submit a written busi
ness plan and give a short presenta
tion of their business idea at the 
competition Tuesday April 30. 
Awards include a cash prize of up to 
$1,500. In the past year, winners 
include a web design, consulting 
company, a company that hopes to 
construct swimming pools for 
instruction, and even a nightclub in 
the Pittsburgh area that hoped to 
hiply refashion itself.
Junior business major Bryan 
Kaplan won last years competition. 
He worked with a then eight-yearold company, Delta New Media, to 
complete their business plan. The 
company was looking to expand, 
and Kaplan saw the opportunity to 
work with an entrepreneurship as 
an undergraduate.

US Steel Posts
PITTSBURGH (AP)  US Steel Corp. 
reported a first-quarter loss Friday of 
$83 million, greater than Wall Street 
expectations, but said flat-rolled steel 
prices have bottomed out and economic 
conditions appear favorable for the 
remainder of 2002.
The countrys largest steel producer 
lost 93 cents per share, compared with a 
net income of $9 million, or 10 cents per 
share, in the first quarter of 2001.
Sales fell 8 percent during the first 
quarter to $1.43 billion from $1.56 bil
lion. Thomas J. Usher, US Steel presi,* dent and chief executive, said economic 
.< conditions domestically and abroad 
 appear to favor the company in the 
;; remainder of 2002.
The removal of some domestic 
capacity and the 30 percent tariffs 
President Bush announced in March 
under his Section 201 remedy should 
provide relief for our flat-rolled seg
ment, Usher said.
Our domestic order rate for the sec
ond quarter sheet product shipments 
has been strong and prices are improv
ing.
The company said facilities that pro
duce flat-rolled steel used by major 
manufacturers are running at capacity, 
which will continue to lower per-unit 
operating costs.
We believe that flat-rolled prices 
bottomed in the first, quarter, Usher 
said. Our flat-rolled steel shipments 
increased by 15 percent versus the
$83 Million Loss
fourth quarter 2001, and our domestic 
raw steel production increased to 92 
percent of capability.
The company also announced plans 
to sell 8 million common shares to the 
public. Usher called the sale a twoedged sword because the company 
needs the cash, but that it is somewhat 
undesirable to sell US Steel stock at its 
current price.
Theres going to be some real oppor
tunities to buy specific assets and or 
companies that will really enhance our 
strategy of moving up the value chain 
and will give us a real competitive 
edge, Usher said. Wed hate to not 
have the flexibility to pursue some of 
these, so we have come up with this pro
posal for this limited offering.
John Surma, chief financial officer at 
US Steel, said while it was a difficult 
quarter with prices down in all seg
ments of the steel industry, he echoed 
comments by Usher in saying that the 
company has a good chance of return
ing to profitability in 2002.
Were encouraged, however, by 
improved operating rates and increas
ing stock prices for most flat-roll prod
ucts, Surma said. We still have work to 
do to return this business to a solid foot
ing of profitability and cash generation, 
but were starting to see signs of 
progress.
Shares of US Steel were up 10 cents 
to $17.86 in afternoon trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

New CIT project course offers 
students industry experience
by Kristin Lala
caRnHEEa( ruEusaR
Youve pored over the textbooks, 
slaved away in labs, and made prob
lem sets an integral part of your 
Friday nights. Whats the next step? 
For many juniors and seniors in CIT, 
the engineering design project 
course is an ideal way of putting uni
versity-instilled knowledge to work 
in the real world. In this course 
(offered next Fall as 39-605 for 12 
units), students and companies col
laborate to design a product. 
Industry leaders supply the funding 
and basic project concept in 
exchange for student ideas and 
product creation. This semester, 
sample projects included Air 
Products (design of a micro-power 
fuel cell to obtain hydrogen from 
methane), Turner Construction 
(implementation of wireless tech
nology to streamline business), and 
Cutler-Hammer (improvement and 
maintenance of circuit breaker sys
tems).
Direct interaction with industry 
participants is a key aspect for stu
dents enrolled in these courses, says 
Dr. Cristina Amon, distinguished 
professor of mechanical engineering 
and director of the Institute for 
Complex Engineering Systems. 
One advantage is that students 
work on projects with real interest 
for the industry, she said. A great 
benefit is the opportunity to get 
feedback from the companies about 
the projects.
Within the course, students are 
typically divided into groups of four 
to six and assigned to a company of 
interest. Engineering students focus 
on the workings of the product, 
whereas other students are drawn 
from business, English, or industrial 
design programs and focus on mar
keting the creation to the targeted 
consumer group. Product appear
ance, interface design, and societal 
impact are important considerations 
for such students.
Rich Hoff, industrial liaison for 
the Institute of Complex 
Engineering Systems, was eager to 
get the word out about project 
courses for students contemplating 
enrolling in an interdisciplinary 
class. In an email interview, Hoff 
said, This is a great forum for stu
dents to interact with companies 
and a good opportunity for compa
nies to get product and market infor
mation from students who bring no 
industry bias to the project.
Amon pointed out that students 
of all areas of academic study could 
benefit from such a course. The set
ting is multidisciplinary. Students 
have the opportunity to work with 
students from other disciplines. 
They appreciate the need to work 
with others, she said.
In addition to helping students 
refine their collaborative skills with 
fellow members of the CMU com
munity, project courses may also 
open doors for internships and 
future employment with big-name 
companies. According to Hoff, We 
think that this type of course is 
extremely relevant as our students 
need to compete in a very tight job 
market. Having an opportunity to 
interact with industry for 15 weeks 
is a great way for students to get vis
ibility with prospective employers.
As this semesters engineering 
design project course wraps up, stu
dents have the opportunity to show
case what they have learned and 
accomplished. Close to 50 students 
from various disciplines in the pro
ject course will present their seven 
finished projects  from 
Bombardiers people-mover design 
(like the ones you see in airports) to 
UPMCs endovascular grafts for 
abdominal aortic aneurysms  on 
Tuesday, April 30, in Scaife Hall 123 
at 4:30 pm.

Argentina swears 
in economic chief
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  
Argentinas president swore in the 
nations sixth economy minister in a 
year Saturday, turning to former 
diplomat and trade expert Roberto 
Lavagna in a bid to turn around the 
crumbling economy. Lavagna, a 60- 
year-old former ambassador to the 
European Union, replaced Jorge 
Remes Lenicov, a longtime Duhalde 
aide who resigned Tuesday after, 
political support for his efforts to 
secure international aid and prop up 
the fragile banking system evaporat
ed.
Mired in a four-year recession, 
Argentina defaulted in December on 
its $141 billion debt, and unemploy
ment has exceeded 18 percent.
Appointed by Congress on January
1, Duhalde is slated to lead the coun
try until September 2003 .
He said more Cabinet changes 
were imminent, telling local news 
agency dHANvNun CRsaEANEun that his: 
minister of industrial production,: 
Jose Mendiguren, would be depart
ing. Lavagna will immediately face 
pressure from international lenders 
for spending cuts. The International 
Monetary Fund is calling for reduc
tions in spending as a precondition 
for new aid.
Lavagna is already under pressure 
to end a banking freeze that has 
severely limited access to savings 
accounts and provoked angryprotests.
Hershey workers 
strike in solidarity
HERSHEY, Penn. (AP)  In a bois
terous show of solidarity, nearly. 
3,000 Hershey Foods Corp. workers 
walked off the job at two factories 
Friday, upset with a company offer; 
that would increase their health 
insurance contributions. The strike! 
affects about one-fifth of the work; 
force at the nation's largest candy-; 
maker, but company officials said it' 
would not interrupt service to its cus
tomers. Hershey Foods has been! 
building inventory and cash reserves; 
in preparation for a walkout, analystssaid.
A deal offered by the company but , 
rejected earlier this month called for; 
worker health insurance contribu
tions to increase from 6 percent to 10 
percent, then 12 percent over four 
years. Workers, who receive an aver-; 
age hourly wage of about $18, would; 
get raises of 2.78 percent in the first 
year, 2.6 percent in the second, 2.65! 
percent in the third and 2.75 percent; 
in the fourth year.
Workers said they also objected to 
the companys refusal to grant their ^ 
pay increase retroactively to when the 
previous contract expired in 
November. Negotiations between 
Hershey and the Chocolate Workers 
Local 464 broke off Wednesday. No 
new talks were scheduled. The com
pany offered to enter into binding 
arbitration Wednesday but the union 
refused, both sides said.
However, Hershey has taken pains 
to prepare well for a strike at the two 
plants, which, combined, account for 
about $2 million a day in sales, said. 
analyst George Askew of Legg Mason. 
Askew said the company has grown; 
inventories by at least $30 millionmore than it needs for this time of 
year and has a cash balance of about 
$220 million on hand.
Man pleads guilty 
to security fraud
NEW YORK (AP) A man accused 
of operating one of the largest securi
ties fraud schemes in history was sen
tenced Friday to eight years and four 
months in prison.
US District Judge Loretta A. Preska; 
ordered Randolph Pace to begin serv
ing his sentence immediately, saying 
he had shown utter contempt for the 
regulatory system.'
She also ordered Pace, 56, to pay 
$134 million in restitution to more 
than 6,000 investors who lost money 
in the fraud he carried out while 
owner of Rooney Pace & Co. Pace was 
accused of ripping off investors with a  
scheme in which 11 worthless securi
ties were pushed on the public in ini
tial public offerings allowing insiders 
including Pace to make millions of 
dollars selling shares.
Pace pleaded guilty in 2000 to con
spiracy, fraud and money laundering.
The judge said Pace deserved a 
long sentence because he had been 
sanctioned five separate times by reg
ulators for violations of the securities 
laws, including for schemes similar to 
the one carried out in this case 
between 1994 and 1997.

29 April \ll\THE TARTANPage A8Thistles and Thorns
| < In this semesters final issue, we present 
<4Thistles and Thorns, a look at the highlights 
iiil low points of the academic year.
; Thistle is given to people, groups, and 
; fronts deserving high honors. A Thorn goes to 
those that the Carnegie Mellon community 
would have been better off without.
! miA Thistle to campus reaction to the events of 
September 11. Groups and academic depart
ments coordinated aid with national relief 
efforts. Students, faculty, and administrators 
bonded together in a way that strengthened 
our quiet resolve. Through candlelight vigils 
and teach-ins, apathy quickly became a 
mantra of activity instead.
! A Thistle to Arshad Chowdhury, who 
responded to the ignorant vigilance of airlines 
with frankness and eagerness.
A Thistle to online voting and the tremen
dous voter turnout for student body elections. 
An active student body, such as the one shown 
at Carnegie Mellon during the academic year 
deserves better representation, however. A 
Thorn to Adam Harber. As a presidential can
didate last year he promised a student web 
portal, but as president oversaw borderlineincompetent Senate leadership and a dearth 
of legislation.
A Thistle for Student Dormitory Council for 
creating the Schatz all-you-can eat dining 
option. However, a Thorn to Dining Services 
for its continued destruction of the meal plan 
and botching of the vacant Highlander Cafe 
space. One would surmise that the popularity 
of an all-you-can-eat meal might indicate a 
need for a cafeteria.
A Thistle to the Underground, which gained 
meaningful student input as it created a viable 
hangout for the residents of Morewood 
Gardens. Its a shame a similar facility doesnt 
exist for the Hill dorms.
A Thistle to several athletic teams, including 
the baseball team. Despite a severe lack of 
funding and administrative support, the squad 
put together an impressive public campaign 
that garnered over 1,000 signatures in support 
of making baseball a NCAA-recognized sport 
at Carnegie Mellon, A Thistle to the softball 
team, which also faced the daunting waters of 
club status.
A Thistle to the accomplishments of the 
mens and womens soccer teams, which made 
the NCAA and ECAC playoffs. A Thistle to the 
swim team, which performed admirably at 
conference finals and produced a national 
champion in sophomore Brian McCarthy.
However, a Thorn to administrative support 
^>1 athletic programs. The school failed to 
I ^address the depressing state of Skibo 
Gymnasium and the Athletic department took 
:no~stance on the issue of baseball becoming 
'NCAA competitive. The Athletic department 
1 should also look into the condensed hours of 
operation for the University Center gym and 
other facilities.
A Thorn to the School of Drama, which fur
ther, segregates itself by charging high admis
sion prices in a capricious manner.
A Thistle to University Center administrator 
Stan Krowitz. His dedication, friendly 
demeanor, and love of CMU are greatly appre
ciated.
A Thistle to University President Jared 
! Cohon. While his interaction with students in 
the fall semester was minimal, he made strides 
by appearing at student-organized discussions 
about nuclear waste, athletics at Carnegie 
Mellon, and several town meetings. President 
Cohon even went as far as to dress up in an 
Easter Bunny costume for a Pugwash fundraisjer.
h: A Thorn to the President for failing to act 
upon his diversity initiatives. While he pushes 
for greater socioeconomic diversity not only in 
the student body, but also among faculty and 
Staff, his Diversity Councils accomplishments 
were few and far between.
A Thorn to student organizations that 
demarcate themselves solely on ethnicity and 
race. Student associations and cultural groups 
must do a better job of integrating themselves 
campus life. And Student Life must pro
vide them the opportunity to do so.
A Thistle to University undergraduate 
research, which included a revised Meeting of
the Minds format, a new undergraduate 
research journal, and enigmatic senior art 
major William Kofmehls controversial 
Lobster Boy5 project. The publicity for a school 
perceived as overly-technical was a boon to 
University Relations. A Thistle to the 
Universitys opening its research policy for 
greater inspection. While we find no surface 
concerns with the current projects, including 
the GOP-funded research of Congressional 
district optimization, periodic reviews of 
University policy can only lend itself to a better 
understanding between the school and the 
community.
Of course, it would be beneficial if Carnegie 
Mellon would actually follow its policies. A 
Thorn to the Calendar Committee. The school 
will finally follow its written finals policy for 
2002-03, but it raises the question as to how 
self-disciplined administrators are; and how 
powerless our student government leaders 
are. Another thorn to GSIA for its schedule, 
which is not in synch with the rest of the 
school.
A Thistle to Student Life and University 
Police who developed an amnesty alcohol pol
icy. The enactment has ensured the well-being 
of students many times this year. Discipline 
above reason should hold no place in our soci
ety.
A Thorn to Homecoming, which offers noth
ing meaningful in terms of school spirit. It 
serves as nothing more than a shallow 
fundraising effort by the school.
A Thistle to the wireless expansion. In the 
spirit of GSIA organizational behaviorists, 
continued upgrades to the nascent network 
will only serve to increase interaction amongst 
students.
A Thorn, however, to the problems with net
work bandwidth. Since the University backed 
down to the Recording Industry Association of 
America in 1999, network traffic in the dorms 
has spurred many problems.
Giving a Thorn to Cluster Services for their 
unwillingness to institute reasonable caps on 
printing seems redundant, but also welldeserved.
A Thorn as well to Enrollment Services. 
During both Fall and Spring online registra
tion sessions, the service failed to respond to 
the enrollment needs of sophomores. We 
also hope the group will examine upgrading 
the archaic student information online ser
vice, which until recently, still said the service 
was offline for the posting of final 
grades...during December.
A Thistle to Housing for an improved room 
draw process. While the failure of the oftbeleaguered group to honor its commitment 
to off-campus housing wireless is disappoint
ing, whats more disconcerting is the discon
tinuation of DSL service for the next school 
year. A Thorn to Housing for the apparent lack 
of foresight.
A Thorn to Campus Police and Student 
Affairs for a lack of communication with the 
student body following the attack and rape of 
a female student during the fall semester. A 
Thistle, however, to Campus Police and Chief 
Creig Doyle for revising their crime alert poli
cy; a mechanism they have used effectively 
with email and poster communication in the 
second semester.
A Thistle to the environmentally-conscious 
policies adopted by the University. The pur
chase of six percent of energy for the campus 
from wind sources is forward-looking and a 
creative use of resources.
A Thorn to county and state governments, 
which advocate for the connection of the MonFayette Expressway between Pittsburghs 
southern suburbs and the Parkway East. 
1950s, Robert Moses-style construction has 
proven to be the bane of existence for modern 
city planners.
A Thorn to the shrowd of mystery that 
envelopes the University Disciplinary 
Committee. Most state schools have public 
processes that ensure fairness and provide 
legitimacy to administration-run justice.
A Thistle to Paul Christiano, who as a stu
dent, professor, and provost, left an indelible 
mark on a world-class research and education
al institution.

Letters to the Editor
Hooray for Carnival!
Dear students of Carnegie Mellon University,
Every year, the students of CMU bust 
their humps to give the city of Pittsburgh a 
fair for children and adults to amuse them
selves. But this year, they outdid themselves 
to the motto of Its whats on the inside that 
counts. Whether it was the students of the 
fraternities that made the Las Vegas 
exhibit and the DUniverse booths or the 
very kind Asian Student Associations 
Beehive exhibit. These latter students let 
my heat-exhausted wife and I into their 
Beehive after many exhibits were already 
closing at 6 pm for the winners party.
My wife Elizabeth and I would just hope 
all the creators, builders, decorators, and 
those students who tirelessly played with 
Pittsburghs children in their booths remem
ber that It is whats on the inside that 
counts. In human terms, not just a Chinese 
take-out box. 7fa dat ]HRI 7N$an editor Kay, 
who compiled a biographical work on all 
those killed on September 11, 2001, said 
this herself about all people the world over, 
No life is ordinary. Everyone is special in 
his own way.
Thank you CMU for spring 2002. Now 
good luck on all those papers, projects, and 
exams!

Faulty reasoning
Editor,
Mr. Yaron Rachlin makes some dangerous 
connections in his article last week, titled 
Hypocrisy towards Jews justifies Israels 
existence. What he is doing is attempting 
to morally justify the dispossession, expul
sion, and oppression of Palestinians at the 
hand of Israel. He is, in fact, no better than 
someone who tries to morally justify a sui
cide bombing against innocent Israelis. He 
says, in other words, oppression against 
Jews in the past justifies Israels oppression 
of Palestinians now. Not only is this logic 
morally bankrupt, it defies history. 
Palestinians, and Arabs for that matter, 
never had any hand in persecuting Jews 
before the advent of Zionism, an ideology 
which sought to create a Jewish state on top 
of the indigenous Palestinians. Jews lived in 
harmony for centuries in the Arab world. In 
fact, the Jews who lived in the Arab world 
were themselves Arab; they were a part of 
the culture. The Palestinians conflict with 
Zionism lies not in the fact that Jews wish to 
live in Palestine, but rather in the fact that 
Zionism has declared that Palestine is a 
place called Israel for Jews and only Jews. 
Jews have always lived and still deserve to 
live in Palestine, but it is morally inconsis
tent to invoke the memory of Jewish suffer
ing in order to justify the oppression of the 
Palestinians. Oppression is oppression, no 
matter the victim, no matter the perpetrator.

Get rid of the Fence?
Editor,
At the busiest and most visible spot on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus lies the Fence. 
This structure is a beloved tradition for 
some members of the campus community 
and a major eyesore for everyone else. 
Personally, I think we should get rid of this 
thing and use that space for something
more attractive  a fountain or garden or 
some benches and trees, perhaps. Even an 
empty patch of grass would be a big 
improvement.
Depending on the talents of the most 
recent gang of painters, the Fence itself 
ranges from kind of ugly to amazingly 
hideous. But thats not the worst part. The 
rules for controlling the Fence guarantee 
that, most of the time, this area will also fea
ture a squalid little shantytown of Fence 
defenders, complete with sleeping bags and 
boom boxes. The area around the Fence 
proper is a paint-spattered gravel pit or mud 
pit, depending on the weather. And, human 
nature being what it is, paint also ends up on 
nearby trees, benches, sidewalks, and grass.
Please understand that I am not against 
free speech and even a bit of chaos  thats 
what universities are for. But there are less 
ugly ways to get your message across, what
ever it may be. Im sure that if the Fence 
went away, we could find a place where stu
dents could hang up large banners or 
posters, without all the runny paint and the 
tents and the orange extension cords.
I know that any suggestion to tamper with 
this campus tradition will be controversial. 
A few fraternities and sororities seem to 
enjoy inflicting their messages on the rest of 
us, and Im sure that a few alumni have fond 
memories of nights spent shivering in sleep
ing bags, breathing paint fumes. However, I 
strongly suspect that the Fence-lovers are a 
small minority of the campus community, 
and that most of us would be very happy to 
see this particular tradition go away. 
Perhaps I am wrong about that, but I think 
its worth some discussion to find out.

Unfair slandering of 
Israel: writer at fault
Editor,
Recently, the students promoting 
National Palestine Week (NPW) used the 
prominent glass displays in the University 
Center to hang a provocative poster. 
Depicted was an Israeli soldier in the back
ground pointing his rifle, in the foreground, 
quite a distance away, was a small, unarmed 
child. The message conveyed boiled down a 
complex conflict to a simplistic image of a 
big mean Israeli soldier and a harmless 
Palestinian Arab child. Was this poster any
thing more than transparent propaganda? 
Hardly. Such incendiary material was the 
norm during NPW. It is because of this that 
Nasser Abukhdeirs column last week (or 
should I say calumny?) seemed shocking. 
How could he, straight-faced, complain 
about pro-Israeli propaganda when NPWs 
idea of educational material consists of one
sided material blaming no one but Israel for 
the ills of the Palestinian Arabs?
A month earlier, the pro-Israel students 
on this campus had reserved a table (this 
can easily be confirmed by Spacequest) to 
help educate students on the insecure reali
ties of Israels situation. The suicide 
bomber poster to which Abukhdeir 
referred was in no way a strike against 
Palestinian Arab mothers. In fact, I have 
nothing but deep sympathy for the countless 
Palestinian Arab mothers who must guard 
their children from being brainwashed into 
becoming suicide bombers and other forms 
of terrorists. The poster was an unambigu
ous portrayal of the fact that Arab Leaders 
from various countries, especially Saddam 
Hussein, are vehemently supporting terror
ism and that this must stop. It is no secret 
that Hussein sends checks of $10,000 to the 
families of gunmen and $25,000 to the fam
ilies of suicide bombers to encourage mar
tyrs against Israel.
Jeremy Canceko, Madoka Katayama/Art Editor, Art Stbff
Israel has been slandered both on this 
campus and in international media, which 
has prompted students here and all over 
North America to defend it. Most recently, 
Israel was accused of a 500-person massacre 
in a terrorist-laden refugee camp in Jenin. 
The world was outraged and built up strong 
emotions against Israel. Since the first 
announcement, the number of dead has 
drastically decreased to a few dozen, some 
of who were even found with explosives 
strapped around their waists. Yes, I will be 
the first to say, Israel lost 23 troops so that it 
could prevent civilian casualties, as opposed 
to Americas air strikes on Afghanistan in an 
attempt to minimize American casualties. It 
is nothing short of a tragedy when an inno
cent child dies in the line of fire, but it is an 
even greater tragedy when terrorists use 
children as human shields and then put all 
the blame on Israel, a nation only trying to 
prevent innocent civilians, of any ethnicity, 
from random acts of terror.

Sophomore, mathematics
Professors display 
immature behavior :
Editor,
I am writing in response to Nasser 
Abukhdeirs article last week, titled Angry 
banter turns off campus to Mid East under
standing. I agree that anger and animosity, 
as well as, I might add, the self-restraint of a 
marketplace matron demonstrated by some 
members of CMU faculty, can do little to 
encourage civil discourse on the subject of 
Middle East crisis. However, I have to bring 
a few clarifications to light about the event 
held on Friday, April 12 that so dismayed the 
author, Nasser Abukhdeir.
This was a vigil to commemorate all inno
cent victims of terrorism. The theme of the 
event drew a parallel between the struggle 
with terrorism that the United States faced 
after the attack of September 11 and the 
constant terror acts that have been taking 
place in Israel.
Students present at the vigil read the 
names of the victims. Those who wished to 
read the name of a friend or a relative that 
had fallen elsewhere in the world under sim
ilar unfortunate circumstances were wel
come to do so. The readings of the names 
were discontinued intentionally before the 
National Palestine Week (NPW) group offi
cially started their vigil. Those who orga
nized the event, however, remained at a 
respectful distance from the NPW group, in 
order to give the CMU students and faculty a 
chance to gather around and express emo
tional support for all those whose lives were 
traumatized by terrorism.
It was then that I witnessed two angry 
attacks by members of the CMU faculty. 
With no regard for the sorrowful nature of 
the event, these academics had told stu
dents present to be ashamed of your coun
try and your people. One of them even 
called the gathered group Nazis. 
Considering that students expect their pro
fessors to be an example in conduct, espe
cially under the conditions of differences in 
opinion, these enraged remarks were shock
ing and hurtful.
In conclusion, one could hardly object to 
the nature of the event of April 12. Criticism 
should instead be directed at those who, 
instead of promoting understanding and 
leading in civil discourse with their unre
strained rage of drunken bullies widen the 
gap between the students on campus.

Well, Ive done this what Ive learned spiel every year, so I 
might as well keep it going. For those of you who are new or 
have better sense than to read this smut, I traditionally list the 
things I learned over the course of the year in the last issue. Its 
just as much a means of avoiding research and thought as it is 
an appraisal, but thats neither here nor there.
After all, Ive spent the last two semesters wandering around 
one of the finer academic institutions in the country. Surely I 
picked something up aside from this god-awful rash. Theres 
nothing wrong with taking stock and evaluating knowledge 
gained. Not one to break with tradition, here goes....
QyR ENgaRnNA5
Writers operate on angst. Well, angst and drugs. Thankfully,
I can count on Carnegie Mellon and its administration to pro
vide me with all the crank I need. The angst I get from ponder
ing my teams semifinal intramural floor hockey semis with a 
bunch of ringers wearing Theta Xi shirts.
- Despite what this school and your parents would have you 
believe, your work is not your life.
- There is a distinct difference between the sound of a CD case 
yielding to pressure and a pill of Ritalin being crushed. Learn it.
- No matter how serious or threatening the matter, CMU Police 
can be trusted to move on an investigation with the speed of an 
anemic three-legged tailless dog with poison darts in its eyes.
- You can never have enough ugly amphitheaters that nobody 
uses.
- A steady regimen of Xanax and beer is the perfect solution to 
insomnia caused by knowing that youre working for the gov
ernment.
e(avANHEaaRNEs
Ive always had a morbid fascination with the writhing 
cesspool of bile that is American politics. It seems akin to driving 
past a thirteen-car pileup. You know you shouldnt watch and 
that you really dont want to look at something so disheartening 
and messy, but you just cant help yourself. My candidacy for SB 
President provided me a whole new level of understanding. 
Although I lost by a hair to that khaki-clad C-3PO looking guy, I 
still feel validated by the knowledge that I garnered enough 
votes to stomp on Michelle Lai like a family of mice in a barn.
- University politics is no place for unconventional honesty. Its 
a place for pressed suits, ass-kissing, and sweet, sweet compla
cency in the face of a student body that day-by-day demands 
and deserves more than those in power are inclined to offer.
- The Texas Rangers are Gods joke on Republicans.
- Democrats are Gods joke on Democrats.
G:f2NAANEs tfaRa L (Nga
God I love this paper. In the way that a mother loves her 
retarded son, mind you. And while things have certainly taken 
a massive turn towards the light, everybodys favorite bastion 
of slanted truth has much progress to make.
- Never ever EVER turn someone like me loose on first-year 
.section editors. Bright eyes, an eager soul, and that certain 
^naivete that can only come from general ignorance shouldnt
be burdened with a rancorous slug such as myself. It isnt 
healthy. Damn if it aint fun, though.
On the other hand, if JFC continues to use budget cuts to 
block Tartan efforts at improvement because certain past sto
ries were less than accurate, Im going to stroll into one of their 
meetings with an eight-inch hunting knife and carve me a few 
slabs of unethical swine. Despite what you see floors 4-6 of 
Warner doing, this isnt a you scratch my back and Ill scratch 
yours type of deal.
- Alcohol indulgence increases over Carnival break is not 
front-page-above-the-fold-caliber news.
CEm u cuRARNmsa NE u cauR 7Raa
Inevitably, there are those lessons learned that dont fit into 
one category. These are they.
- Carrot Top is not funny.
- New Orleans is the Valhalla of the depressed and morallyrepugnant members of our society. Plans for my return are in 
the works.
- Never bet your income tax refund on Kansas.
- Watching PiKAs fire truck spew more smoke than The Jimbo 
after a shaft hit was quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever 
seen; second perhaps only to seeing Dean Murphy buy a pack of 
Magnums, a tube of cocoa butter, and a shoehorn at Rite Aid.
- Some people will never understand the notion of passing to 
the left.
- The Strokes suck. Yeah, I said it. Their music was better 
when Iggy Pop and Lou Reed were making it. Please, you hor
ribly unoriginal schmucks go back to upstate New York, drive 
^our daddys SUVs, and smoke your Jimson. Im tired of hear
ting you crucify FfNAa NsfA4FfNAa oauA
- Ringo WILL be the last living Beatle.
- No matter what happens, somebody somewhere somehow 
will find a way to take things far too seriously.
.; Thats it. Im done. Only one more year of me before you

Need for a reformation  
Islam radicals inhibit progress
CHRISTIAN RESTIFO
Its 85,400 square meters in size. It 
will cost over $200 million to build 
and roughly $25 million a year to 
operate. Its taken 20 years to get off 
the ground, and it will hold over 4 mil
lion titles if fully stocked.
What is it? Its the Library of 
Alexandria; an ambitious project to 
build a world-class library in Egypt 
whose supporters hope will be a new 
center for Islamic study. Youll notice 
that I wrote if fully stocked above. 
Chances are, it may never reach its 
potential. Whether or not it does will 
play a key factor in the long term via
bility of Islamic religion and culture.
The effects of colonialism 
still reverberate through the 
Middle East, and the world 
tends to value regional 
stability over human rights.
Centuries ago, a previous library in 
Alexandria provided a vast trove of 
human knowledge and supported 
important research. Alexandria suf
fered numerous attacks, however, and 
the library eventually disappeared.
In the early 1980s, the University of 
Alexandria donated land for the new 
library, and Egypt provided the finan
cial support. Alongside the develop
ment of the library, the Egyptian gov
ernment undertook a massive revital
ization of the surrounding area in 
order to encourage growth and attract 
tourists and scholars.
However, people are already voicing 
concern over the librarys contents. 
Will fundamentalists permit writings 
they consider unlslamic? Michael
 Lange succinctly explained things in 
iynNEann FaaI If he (director Ismail 
Serageldin) wants to put Salman 
Rushdie on the shelves, he wont get 
away with saying, Its a library, and 
its not my fault someone printed the 
book. 
Herein lies the opportunity for 
Islam to regain its position as an influ
ential force in the world. If the Library 
of Alexandria can be stocked with 
numerous books covering multitudes 
of opinions on Islam, other religions, 
law, social sciences, and so forth, it can 
become a new center of learning and 
advance Islamic religion and culture. If 
not, Islam, at least as practiced in many 
parts of the Middle East, will continue 
to devolve into a fundamentalist form 
that does little to advance mankind 
spiritually or materialistically.
Harsh words, yes, but consider that 
what Islam needs is a combined refor
mation and renaissance. It once had 
one. As Islam spread and came into 
contact with different cultures, it 
absorbed important philosophies and 
thoughts. After years of translating 
and studying the works of Greeks, 
Christians, Jews, and many other reli
gions and cultures, Arabic learning 
and science started to make its own 
original contributions to knowledge. 
Some scholars greatly advanced med
ical science, and others made impor
tant discoveries in chemistry and 
astronomy. As we all know, we get our 
numbers from Arabic.
Around this time, a more rationalis
tic form of Islam came into being. 
However, the intolerance of its follow
ers caused a revolt, and a more strict, 
dogmatic form of Islam was put in its 
place. As a result, critical examination 
from a scientific, rational viewpoint 
ended.
Fast forward some centuries, and

Govt, wastes tax 
money for pork
Suneal Chandran
April: the time of year when Americans 
come together to pay their dues to Uncle 
Sam. Your fellow citizens, not to mention 
your parents, are writing up page after page 
of income statements, deductions, calcula
tions, etc. We all know how much we our
selves pay, but how much of our money does 
the government spend wisely? The taxpayer 
advocacy group Citizens Against Government 
Waste recently released its 2002 annual cNs 
iHHIJ a listing of all the home district pro
jects and Congressional earmarks, better 
known as pork barrel spending.
According to the cNs iHHIJ the normal 
process for preparing the governments bud
get goes, something like this: ...the 
Presidents budget gets into the hands of the 
appropriators. Members of Congress 
approach the appropriators asking for favors, 
promising votes in return. They get the goods 
through a form of legal money laundering, 
but taxpayers receive only inflated taxes and 
a bloated bureaucracy. This years total of 
$20.1 billion in pork sets a new record. While 
it is only a small part of this nations budget, 
it costs you money. In fact, that is enough 
money for every American man, woman, and 
child to receive about seventy dollars back 
from the federal government. Moreover, for 
that same $20 billion, the Navy could buy 
about twenty new destroyers or the 
Department of Justices entire budget could 
double in size. Added up over ten years, that 
$200 billion could have completed the 
Presidents initial proposed tax cut of $1.6 
trillion, instead of the lesser amount agreed 
upon.
CAGW also released the Oinker Awards, 
the best examples of pork. The Shear Waste 
Award went to Senator Conrad Burns of

There was some fishy business at 
Spring Carnival, and Im not talking 
about the band Reel Big Fish. The booths 
operated by the Japanese Culture Club 
(JCC) and Sigma Nu awarded live gold
fish as prizes, with repercussions con
trary to the fun of Carnival. Many of the 
fish died shortly afterwards being distrib
uted to the games participants, because 
of alleged diseases, poor conditions, and 
ignorance about how to take care of the 
animals.
Within the beautiful and alluring land
scape of a Zen Garden, JCCs booth had a 
large tub filled with goldfish. Children 
and other participants tried to catch the 
fish, using nets made of rice-paper. The 
goal of the game was to capture the fish 
before the rice-paper disintegrated in the 
water. This led to many gamers playing 
illegitimately by jabbing the fish with the 
plastic handles. In addition to their vic
timization by poking, the fish suffered in 
wretched conditions of filthy water and 
close contact. Consequently, some con
tracted LvfAf5H1fAfNRNyn $y(ANpN(NNnJ a par
asitic disease commonly known as ick 
that causes the skin and tissue to deform. 
Winners at the fishing game were given a 
small container with which to carry the 
fish home, and shortly after leaving 
Carnival, were largely clueless on what to 
do with the animals. Requests for com
ment were ignored by the appropriate 
JCC contact.

Montana, who is sending $400,000 
to the Montana Sheep Institute. The 
Taxpayers Get Squeezed Award 
went to research in Alabama involv
ing Satsuma Oranges that will cost 
$800,000. The Sapping the 
Taxpayers Award? Different 
research projects on wood, costing 
you $13.6 million. Do you see a 
trend in the way these are named? 
Okay, maybe all these are examples 
of government supporting research, 
which it does all the time. But just 
wait  it gets better. The Pedaling 
Pork Award went to the $6.8 million 
the government wants to spend on 
bike paths. And my top pick for this 
years dumbest expenditure: The 
Taxpayers Get Tattooed Award, to 
Representative Lois Capps, a 
Democrat from California. How did 
she wisely spend our money? For a 
tattoo removal program, San Luis 
Obispo, California received 
$50,000.
How are our elected officials in 
Washington able to tack on spend
ing like this? It is mostly done in
committees, especially the appro
priations committees of both houses 
and the appropriations subcommit
tees of other committees. For exam
ple, because it is home to 
Democratic Senator Tom Harkin, a 
member of the Appropriations 
Committee and chair of the
Most of these projects are 
only local in nature, and 
provide no benefit to anyone 
but a few folks whose votes 
the congressman needs in 
the next elections._______
Agriculture Committee, Iowa will 
receive $200,000 for hoop barns, 
which are basically shelters for pigs, 
and the National Swine Research 
Center will get $400,000 for 
manure management research.
Usually, it is influential members 
of the Appropriations Committee 
who bring home the most bacon, so 
to speak. One of the greatest porkers
of all time, Senator Robert Byrd, a 
Democrat from West Virginia, chair
man of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, was one of this years 
victors, sending $388 million to his 
home state. His projects included $7 
million for a positron emission 
tomography facility and several mil
lion dollars for various aquaculture 
programs, including $4.5 million for 
the National Center for Cool and 
Cold Water Aquaculture. Senators 
seem to have done exceptionally 
well, compared to the House. Some 
projects simply reflect the enor
mous egos and the vanity of some 
senior members. Byrd is famous for 
funding projects that bear  sur
prise, surprise  his own name. 
This years Narcissist Award from 
the cNs iHHI went to Senator Ernest 
Fritz Hollings (D-SC), for securing 
$14 million for the Hollings Marine 
Laboratory and another $1 million 
for the Hollings Cancer Center.
Both Republicans and Democrats 
alike love pork. Many politicians are 
elected solely on their ability to 
bring home the dough. The fact is, 
most of these projects are only local
in nature, and provide no benefit to 
anyone but a few folks whose votes 
the congressman needs in the next 
elections. This is simply wrong, and 
as Adam Smith said, It is unjust 
that the whole society should con
tribute towards an expense of which 
the benefit is confined to a part of 
the society.
Only one congressman has stood 
out against pork barrel spending, 
Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). But 
any legislation limiting pork is diffi
cult, and probably impossible to 
pass. The President could, in theory, 
veto the appropriations bills, but 
then he would be vetoing the fund
ing of the executive branch as well. 
This all comes at a time when the 
budget is in a deficit and the econo
my is in a recession. Surely, we 
could find better ways to use this 
money. Until Congress looks beyond 
its own narrow interests and consid
ers the national good, you and I will 
be footing the tax bill.

The library without any books: the fate of Alexandria
CLUBS, from page A1
now many followers of Islam in the Middle East 
feel resentful at the rise of Western culture and 
the decline of Islams influence. Some have even 
engaged in a form of Islamic pseudo-Creationism 
in which they try to prove that the Koran predict
ed certain advances such as genetic engineering. 
Factor in some cultural and economic conditions, 
and things are ripe for radicals to take control.
Contrast this to what happened in Europe. The 
Reformation, the Renaissance, the rise of rational 
inquiry, and so forth all led to significant politi
cal, legal, cultural, and religious changes that 
permitted the West to greatly advance. It did not 
happen overnight, and it was by no means a 
pleasant process. However, it continues to this 
day; fundamentalists, however, have taken over 
Islam and stopped all progress. They did the same 
thing to the GfuRNPuJ the legal system in Islam. It 
advanced and developed until the ninth century, 
when conservative forces killed all progress.
Of course, the West has not always provided 
the best support for such a change. Despite the 
currently tenuous relationship, the United States
supports the monarchy in Saudi Arabia in 
exchange for oil supply stability. The effects of 
colonialism still reverberate through the Middle 
East, and the world tends to value regional stabil
ity over human rights.
But the change must still come from within. 
More and more, I wish Bush would not have used 
his axis of evil speech, mainly because of Iran. 
Before September 11, the country had a golden 
opportunity to support Iran in its transition. 
Younger people, disillusioned with the leaders of 
the revolution, clamored for more freedoms. 
They elected President Rafsanjani, a moderate 
who has successfully navigated a fine line 
between pushing for reforms and not enraging 
conservative clerics who have the final say on 
important state matters.
I do believe that groups in Iran, and even cer
tain parts of its government, support terrorists. 
But thats a place where the United States could 
have applied pressure instead of shutting down 
all progress with Bushs comments. (Iraq and 
North Korea can wait. They will collapse under 
their own weight sooner or later.)
Improved relations with Iran could have meant
more economic, cultural, and educational inter
action. No doubt this would have influenced peo
ple and shown them the benefits of Western cul
tural progress.
Now this is not to say that Iran (or Islam) 
should adopt Western thought per se. Rather, 
adopting such concepts as rational inquiry and 
religious tolerance (which is actually advocated 
in the Koran) would permit Islam to once again 
progress.
Will this ever happen? Im not sure. Much of 
the Middle East now views itself in the frame
work of Islam vs. the West, a view reciprocated 
by many in the US and elsewhere. Until the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is permanently 
resolved, people will only see the conflict; con
servatives will also have ample opportunity to 
propagate their radical form of Islam.
In the meantime, perhaps the library will ger
minate a seed of a new awakening in Islam that 
can bear fruit in the future. Well just have to wait 
and see.

FISH, from page A9
into enthusiasm for Buggy. The frater
nity has used the same physical struc
ture for its booth for two consecutive 
years, and conducted identical activi
ties with a similar booth for about a 
dozen years. The activity consists of 
throwing a ping-pong ball into a cup, 
and winners receive fish as prizes. 
Without any effort to conform directly 
to annually changing themes, Sigma 
Nu hopes to continue using their cur
rent Booth idea for many years to 
come. Apathy is the key to a success
ful booth. We are the only organiza
tion in Booth history to turn a profit, 
joked Sigma Nu Booth Chairman 
Esteban Bowles-Martinez.
Sigma Nu acquired about 400 feeder 
goldfish for the event, because they 
require little maintenance. While little 
needed to be done to take care of the 
fish, many ideas were suggested. 
Consuming the fish while alive, letting 
them float in alcohol, and urinating on 
them were all considered, even if in 
jest. Theyre easier to catch for the 
kids when theyre too drunk and disIt doesn't take much to achieve 
mastery over raising a goldfish, 
but knowing not to microwave 
it is far from the only step.
oriented to swim away, remarked 
Bowles-Martinez. While concern for 
the animals was not a priority for 
Sigma Nu, the commendable rescue 
actions conducted by members of the 
CMU-Pitt animal rights alliance Voices 
for Animal Liberation (VAL) did not 
exude any apathy.
After arriving at Carnival too late on 
Saturday to adopt the fish remaining 
from JCCs booth, VAL activists turned 
their attention to Sigma Nu. They went 
to the fraternitys house, and liberated 
the estimated 100 fish that were still 
alive. These fish were in a plastic bag 
in a trash can. Several in there were 
dead  perhaps more died since the 
living were eating the dead. There 
were lots of half-fish corpses, 
explained Venkatesh Natarajan, a 
graduate assistant in mathematical 
sciences, the only CMU student who 
participated in the rescue efforts.
The remaining fish that had not fall
en victim to cannibalism or other 
deaths were either adopted by stu
dents at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, 
or placed in a nearby freshwater pond. 
Over the next two days about 25 or soONLINE EXCLUSIVE:

died. Even so, I would say the rescue 
was successful because the majority 
did survive and are now living in a 
pond where they can swim freely, 
said VAL Business Manager and 
Secretary Candice Zawoiski, a student 
at Pitt.
To prevent such problems in the 
future, VAL has started a petition to 
ban the use of animals for entertain
ment or prize purposes at Pitt. This is 
one of the issues that we will be trying 
to tackle at the beginning of the next 
school year, commented group presi
dent Kristyn Bryan. The group hopes 
that a moratorium on the usage of ani
mals for entertainment purposes will 
soon take form at both CMU and Pitt.
Keeping fish in murky water and 
jokes about urinating on them werent 
even the worst component of this 
ordeal. The fishs lives did not become 
blissful once they were no longer sub
ject to cannibalism or prodded with 
plastic nets. Most recipients of fish 
were clueless on how to take care of 
them, and the fish consequently did 
not fare very well. Most little kids who 
got fish were ignorant, but CMU stu
dents did not necessarily have any 
such knowledge either.
Even people who have had fish as 
pets in the past were unable to care for 
them because of diseases and a lack of 
appetite. Neither of them would eat, 
said first-year physics major Melissa 
Eliot, who won two fish at the JCC 
booth. We couldnt do anything about 
that.
Carnival is all about having fun, and 
even apathy should not be completely 
sacrificed if thats how some people 
enjoy themselves. However, criteria 
such as concern for the well-being of 
all people and other living creatures 
participating must be taken into 
account. The fish involved in JCC and 
Sigma Nus booths were not only kept 
in wretched conditions, but they were 
doomed once awarded to people who 
did not know how to care for animals. 
It doesnt take much to achieve mas
tery over raising a goldfish, but know
ing not to microwave it is far from the 
only step. Whats next  listening to 
Gwars proposition to use fish as sex 
toys in anal intercourse? The moratori
um desired by VAL at Pitt will hopeful
ly also follow suit at CMU so Carnival 
and other entertainment events can be 
fun for truly everyone.

2001-2002: Tartan athletes enjoy unprecedented success, while reaching new heights
RECAP, from page A14
able 11-4-1 in the regular season, 
which was the most wins the team 
has recorded in a season since 1994.
By virtue of their improved perfor
mance, the team earned an invite to 
the ECAC regional tournament, and 
shut out both Gettysburg and 
Lebanon Valley College on the way to 
a final match against Johns Hopkins 
University, but were themselves shut 
out in the decisive match.
dous improvement from the previous 
year, the women seem determined 
that they can do even better next 
year.
Mens Basketball
zavHRm D.YM :S.YY CC2
Faced with an ever-changing roster 
in one of the toughest conferences in 
Division III, the basketball team 
found an identity during holiday 
break and started playing exciting, 
competitive basketball. Besides
Matt Meurer/Assistant Photo Editor
Danyelle Sinclair, a hard-nosed defende and could develop into a power forward.
The women also set several indi
vidual records this season. Junior 
goalkeeper Maya Nigrosh set a new 
mark for goals-against average, with 
a mark of .64 on the season, and tied 
the record for shutouts in a season 
with 10. Also, senior Katie Snell set a 
new record for most assists in a game 
with three, and junior Melissa 
McMorrow, who scored seven points 
against Lake Erie College, set the new 
mark for most points scored in a sin
gle game.
The squad will have quite a chal
lenge next season, as seniors Snell, 
Melanie Stawartz, and Ashley 
Wermine will be graduating this year. 
However, buoyed by their tremen
senior Dom Ionadi, who leaves CMU 
as the all-time leading three point 
shooter, and junior Ross Freeman, 
every player on the roster for the 
2001-2002 season was an under
classman. If this young core of play
ers can stay together and improve the 
fundamental aspects of their game, 
like free throws, then they should be 
able to compete in the UAA.
The Tartans finished with a strong 
6-5 non-conference record, but they 
were only 3-11 in the UAA, showing 
that they still have not quite reached 
the level. Losing 10 players since the 
end of the 2000-2001 did not help, 
but the team used the winter break to 
bond together and practiced a new
offensive philosophy. As a result, the 
team came out with an energized 
style of play that focused on creating 
chances to mask their poor shooting. 
As a result, they won four out of five 
games in January after starting 3-8.
The Tartans were led by their 
Ionadi, Freeman, and sophomore 
Matt Kaitz. Kaitz led the team in scor
ing with 13.5 points a game and 7.6 
rebounds a game as he captured a 
spot on the second team all-UAA 
team. Ionadi connected with a school 
record 69 three-pointers and was sec
ond on the team with 13 points a 
game, earning him an Honorable 
Mention on the all-UAA team. 
Freeman was second on the team 
with 7.5 rebounds a game, also earn
ing him an Honorable Mention on the 
all-UAA team.
Womens Basketball
zavHRm YK.YY :K.YV CC2
Charged by a 10-1 non-conference 
record, the womens basketball team 
fought through the tough UAA con
ference full of nationally ranked 
teams while compiling their third 
consecutive winning season. They 
begun the season on fire, winning 11 
of their first 14, but then faded as 
they reached the conference part of 
their scheduled, costing them a 
chance to play in the postseason tour
nament. Their shooting went cold, 
which coupled by an injury to defen
sive leader Erin Brady, caused them 
to lose five straight games.
Junior Erin Brady led the team 
both offensively and defensively 
with 13.5 points per game, 6.8 
rebounds per game, and 1.65 blocks 
per game, earning her a spot on the 
second-team all UAA team. Junior 
Michelle Sodini was second on the 
team in scoring with 12.9 points per 
game and received first team UAA 
honors. Sophomore Carissa Sain shot 
.391 from the 3-point line and con
tributed 12.7 points per game and 
was given Honorable Mention on the 
all-UAA team.

The Tartan women, coming off last 
seasons solid fifth place within the 
UAA, showed just how much they 
had improved in the off-season, as 
they burst to a 6-1 overall dual meet 
record, and a spectacular second 
place finish in the UAA champi
onships. The teams finish at UAAs, as 
well as its dual meet record, marked 
the best finish by a CMU womens 
team in school history.
The womens program also 
received a shot in the arm from firstyear diver Mindi Finnegan, who was 
the lone Tartan woman to win an 
event at UAAs. Her UAA record-set
ting score of 405.30 in the 1-meter 
dive was good enough to send her to 
the NCAA meet, and her perfor
mance at nationals made Finnegan 
the first Tartan diver to ever score at 
a national meet. Finnegan was also 
named UAA Diver of the Year after 
the conference meet.
The mens team, for their part, 
picked up right where they left off 
last season, compiling a 7-0 dual 
meet record, their second in as many 
seasons, a second-place finish at 
UAAs, and a team-best fourth place at 
nationals.
In the process, the team broke 11 
school records and four conference 
records, and crowned a national 
champion in sophomore Brian 
McCarthy, who became the first 
Tartan to win a national champi
onship since the mid 1990s.
Following McCarthys example 
from last season, first-year phenom 
Chris Pearson earned both the 
Swimmer of the Year and Rookie of 
the Year awards at UAAs, and man
aged to break a school or pool record 
nearly every time he competed.
At nationals, the men continued 
their dominance, knocking over 12

more school records. One of these 
was set by sophomore Brian Jucha in 
the 100-yard freestyle. The old 
record, set by CMU alumnus Steve 
Francis, had stood for 10 years, mak
ing it the longest-remaning record; 
that is, until Jucha broke it with his 
time of 46.13.
Womens Volleyball
zavHRm l;.; :YV.l CC2
This year marked a series of mile
stones for the CMU volleyball team. 
The teams 27-7 overall record 
marked the best finish in team histo
ry. In addition, the women were able 
to defeat powerful conference rival 
Washington University by a score of 
3-0, marking the first time a CMU 
team had accomplished the feat.
Also, the teams second place finish
in the UAA tourney, the team was 
rewarded with its first-ever berth in 
the NCAA D-III tournament. Despite 
ultimately falling to Mount St. 
Josephs College in the first round of 
the national tournament, the team 
hopes to get even better for next sea
son.
The team also managed to accrue 
some individual milestones as well, 
as junior outside hitter Lauren 
Schmidt earned second-team AllAmerican honors, and was also 
named the UAA Player of the Year. 
And although senior middle hitter 
Sara Lechleitner will be leaving the 
team, the presence of Schmidt, as 
well as the young talent the women 
possess, should be enough to assure 
that the women will improve next 
year.
Baseball dominates in only third game
BASEBALL, from page A14
lineup hit the ball, none of our 
batters struck out, our pitching 
is coming around, but it is the 
end of the semester, what are 
you going to do? Despite the 
frustration from the rainouts, 
the CMU baseball team suffers 
more disappointment from the 
fact they are not a varsity team. 
One of the biggest things we 
have trouble with as a non-varsi
ty program is scheduling the
tougher teams. Tougher teams 
dont want to play a club team. 
Bogard said, Some of the better 
Junior College and Division 3 
schools, we cant even get on our 
schedule, even if we beat them 
in the past, because were not a 
varsity club.
Regardless of the caliber of 
teams they play, regardless of 
the support they dont get from 
the administration, regardless of 
the frustration that this spring 
has given them, Bogard reiterat
ed that the team puts all of that 
past them each time they take 
the field. We just love to play 
the game. Whether it is a win or 
a loss, we enjoy the game, but it 
is especially rewarding when we 
just pound a team like we did 
Saturday.
This resounding victory in a 
semester filled with defeat gives 
the team hope for the upcoming 
fall semester when they look to 
earn the respect they have not 
yet been given.
Sports fans find the excitement in games of chance
EXCITEMENT, from page A14
This probably seems like a common 
sense observation, but at a time when 
viewership of most professional sports is 
down both live and on TV, its important 
for the leagues to take a look at the real 
reasons. While they focus on making the 
games more attractive, with more scor
ing, fewer breaks, more action, or what
ever, fans are still staying away in droves 
because in the long run they already 
know whats going to happen.
Since sports became a big business the
results go to the teams with the money, 
and there arent that many of them.
With the exception of the NFL over the 
past couple of years, every major sport 
has at most four or five teams who can 
honestly say they have a legitimate 
chance to win the championship. When 
the same results keep happening over 
and over again, its simply not interesting 
to watch anymore, even for fans of the 
teams that do well.
Im not going to let this column devolve 
into yet another rant about how this 
could be fixed by a salary cap, but when
sports arent fun for the fans anymore, 
theres no point in keeping them around. 
There need to be more successes for the 
underdogs like the Hurricanes or the 
Diamondbacks in last years World Series 
to show that not everything turns out the 
way its expected to. After all, thats why 
they play the games.

Aerni, team ready for big time
TRACK, from page A14
Aerni, whose first steeplechase 
competition was a little over a year 
ago, remained humble. Ive been try
ing to not expect anything at nation
als and just see what happens, she 
said.
Coach Dario Donatelli is confident 
that Aerni will make a mark on 
nationals. I think shes poised and 
ready to go. Shes obviously mentally 
ready, I just need to make sure shes 
physically ready, he said.
The Baldwin-Wallace meet was 
also a place of close calls and disap
pointment for some competitors. 
Fifth-year senior John Hursh came 
within three seconds of qualifying for 
nationals with his 3000m steeple
chase time of 9:28.30. And in the 
mens hammer throw, junior Scott 
Jubeck and junior Bob Barton both 
fouled.
2002 marks the first year that the 
womens steeplechase will be a 
national event, and nearly 60 runners 
have met the 12-minute provisional 
standard. However, the criteria for 
nationals will likely allow only the 
top ten or fifteen people to compete, 
Aerni said.
Donatelli emphasized the potential 
for competitors in this years steeple
chase to really make an impact. 
What makes this special is that this 
is the first year that theyre going to
be having [the womens steeple
chase], so whoever does well in this 
event will be remembered, he said.
Aerni credits the last few weeks of 
performance as good preparation for 
the meet at Baldwin-Wallace. It was 
actually like a pretty hard week of 
practice but we tapered like the last 
couple of weeks so my legs felt pretty 
good from that and we actually did 
some pretty good miles, she said.
Donatelli agreed that his runners 
were well prepared for the final 
meets of the spring. Realistically, 
were at the point in the season where 
theyre starting to get into better 
shape. Weve been training hard for 
four months, he said.
Donatelli highlighted several cur
rent track members who will be 
invaluable to the team in the coming 
seasons, including sophomore 
Patrick Fisher, junior Mike Rossi, 
first-year Ethan Coffey, and sopho
more Alex Weiss.
Regardless of her outcome at the 
national meet, Aerni is looking for
ward to the 2003 track season. Next 
year should be pretty exciting 
because I think were getting a lot of 
recruits, a lot of pretty good incoming 
freshmen, she said. I hope to keep 
running the steeplechase, but as a 
team, well see where it goes.

With the demand of academics

As others hear about the program

Being the only senior on the

Track finishes strong at Baldwin-Wallace
Softball finishes up season, earns respect
by Tristan Hoffmann
CnnNnnAuEA G1HRAn emNAHR
The softball teams wrapped up 
what was officially their second sea
son as a club sport with a double 
header against LaRoche and Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania on 
Saturday. 2002 should probably be 
considered their first season. Last 
year, the club spent their energies 
trying to organize under the guid
ance of senior business administra
tion and psychology major Aradhana 
Bothra, junior CS and art major Katy 
Tanis, and graduate student Dominic 
Boccelli, who was their coach before 
current head coach John McConahy.
As a result, this was the softball 
teams first year against strong com
petition with a full schedule and 
despite little success in the victory 
column, the squad did make 
progress.
Other coaches have told me that 
they were impressed by the teams 
development, said McConahy, who 
would not disclose the teams record. 
Several have told me that we are 
leaps and bounds ahead of most 
first-year programs.
The teams current roster consists 
of 24 players and four coaches. The 
majority of the squad are first-years, 
creating a solid foundation to build 
on. According to McConahy, the 
teams biggest need for next year is
students with experience as a fast 
pitch pitcher. The team also hopes to 
continue to draw from the pool of 
graduate students for assistant 
coaches.
Everyone is very supportive of 
each other, said Bothra. There are 
many obstacles that come along with 
being a club sport, but everyone is 
dedicated, hard working, and just 
loves playing ball. I think that is one 
of the reasons why we have done so 
well as a team this season.
In 2003 the team hopes to expand 
from this seasons schedule. Already 
they have added Slippery Rock 
College to such schools as Penn StateSee SOFTBALL, page A13

You can say the CMU baseball team doesnt 
have the respect of a varsity squad, for they 
dont have the funding, they dont have support 
from the administration, and they dont have 
the competition varsity squads have. You can 
say they dont have the respect of a varsity pro
gram, but you cant say they dont have the tal
ent of one. On Saturday the Tartans played 
their third game of what has been a frustrating 
spring. In the wake of an unsuccessful bid to 
represent CMU as a varsity team, and in the 
midst of a rainy yunzer spring, they have 
been forced to overcome both rejection and 
cancellation just to play the game they love. 
But none of that mattered against Penn State 
New Kensington. The team put aside their dis
appointment and delivered a 14-1 drubbing in 
what will be their final game this semester.
Led by sophomore economics major Joe 
Ciccarellis strong pitching performance (7 IP, 
2H, 1R, 11 SO, IBB), and a solid defensive out
ing which saw no fielding errors, the Tartans 
held New Kensington to only one run in seven 
innings. CMU matched their near flawless 
defensive outing with an offensive explosion. 
Racking up 14 runs on 10 hits, including a 
Ciccarelli home run off the scoreboard, the 
Tartans put on a show. Not one batter struck 
out, and 10 separate players scored en route to 
their most dominating performance of the sea
son.
What was most impressive to me was after a 
couple weeks off from rain, we committed no 
errors, said head coach Rich Grieser. The 
defense was there, the hitting was there. It was 
nice to see us respond after all weve been 
through.
CMUs record for the spring stands now at 
1-2. After a poor hitting performance in a 4-0 
loss their first spring game, and a 2-run lead 
blown in the top of the ninth in their second 
outing, the Tartans were able to pull together 
Saturday to finish the season with a high. 
Because of the weather, the team was never 
really able to get a flow going, and ended the 
season just as they started coming together.

Sports excitement 
hinges on chance
Depp rsio
Another school year comes to a 
close, and so this will be my last 
opportunity to wax poetic about our 
national pastime until August. As my 
parting thought for the year, Id like 
to discuss what I think is the main 
reason that people follow baseball (or 
any other sport, for that matter): 
unpredictability.
Certainly this holds for other forms 
of entertainment as well. The most 
popular books and movies are gener
ally those with twists and surprise 
endings, but even a couple interesting 
plot twists cannot hope to compete 
with an entire sports season on these 
grounds.
The prime example of this is any 
pro sports draft. In the NFL draft 
held a few weeks ago, for example, 
there were about 8000 gazillion 
mock draft boards made up before
hand and not one was remotely close 
to what actually happened in the first 
round alone.
For more specific examples, we can 
look at a pair of baseball games from 
last Saturday. Ask 1000 people before 
the season started who would throw 
the first no-hitter of the year, and I 
can guarantee that only a certifiable 
loon would have said Derek Lowe. Yet 
the man who pitched himself out of 
the closers role for the Red Sox in 
April of 2001 turned the trick against 
the Devil Rays.
In what might be an even more 
astonishing feat, the Mariners were 
held to one hit on the same day by the 
Yankees Ted Lilly, but won the game 
1-0. Even more amazing is that the 
one hit wasnt a home run. After a 
walk and a wild pitch put a runner on 
second, a lone single provided the dif
ference in the game.
These two games arent the only 
examples from last Saturday. Over in 
the NHL playoffs, the Los Angeles 
Kings avoided elimination again by 
holding off the defending champion 
Colorado Avalanche, continuing a 
comeback thats taken the series from 
3-1 to 3-3. Not to be outdone, the 
Carolina Hurricanes, the only num
ber three seed to be an underdog to 
the number six seed finished off the 
two-time defending Eastern 
Conference champion New Jersey 
Devils in six games.
The point of all this is that this is 
why we watch the games. Yes, we all 
have our favorite teams and players 
that we enjoy rooting for, but if you 
knew going in that at the end of the 
season your team would finish in 
third place and get bumped out of the 
playoffs early, there wouldnt be any 
point in following along anymore.

At the start of the year Charles 
Martin posed seven questions on the 
upcoming football season. The 
answers to these questions would 
determine the success or failure of 
the Tartans in their effort to bounce 
back from 2000s 6-4 record. Since 
this is the time for final grades, lets 
see how the team did.
7. Will the tight ends be more pro
ductive?
Prior to 2001, juniors Scott Jubeck 
and Brian Vest were mostly an after
thought in the CMU offense. This 
year however, the tight ends became 
more of a factor in the passing game. 
Jubeck was rewarded with secondteam All-UAA honors for his perfor
mance last year.
6. How does the defense replace 
insideline backer Nick Zitelli?
The Tartan linebacking core didnt 
miss a beat in 2001. Frank Adam first 
team all conference, and senior cap
tain Michael Hubbert made his last 
season his finest.
5. How does the offense replace 
deep threat Mike McLaughlin? 1
Matt Saneholtz, Sebastian Smelko 
and Josh Becker gave the Tartans 
downfield targets. Smelko garnered 
first team all conference honors 
despite missing two conference
The game was tied at seven all when 
CMU self-destructed, turning the 
ball over on three of their last four 
possessions. Wash. U capitalized and 
scored 10 unanswered points to win 
the game. On a positive note Wash. U 
did not block a CMU punt for the 
third consecutive year.
2. Speaking of punts, who will 
replace All-UAA punter Matt Young?
First-year Laird Stabler took over 
the punting duties and performed 
very capably. Stablers 37.1 punt 
average placed him second in the 
UAA and earned him second-team 
all-conference honors.
1. Can the Tartan offense break 
double digits against UAA foes 
Chicago and Wash. U?
The Wash. U game aside, CMU 
performed very well in the confer
ence compiling a 3-1 record and 
placing them second. The Chicago 
game was the most exciting game of 
the year. CMU won 20-14 on Ryan 
McMillens 92-yard fumble return in 
the second overtime. Overall, CMU 
finished with a 7-2 record with 
come-from-behind victories against 
Chicago, Rochester, and Grove City

The mens soccer team treaded 
familiar territory this season, as they 
lost only two matches during the 
regular season en route to a second 
consecutive UAA championship and 
their second consecutive NCAA tour
nament bid. Also, junior midfielder 
Adam Hibshman won the UAA 
Player of the Year award for the sec
ond consecutive year, and also gar
nered second-team All-American 
honors.
However, the team also charted 
some unknown territory, picking up 
their first-ever win in an NCAA tour
nament match, felling Bethany 
College by a score of 3-0 in a prelim
inary game. In addition, the Tartans 
first round matchup with Messiah 
marked the second season in a row 
that the two teams faced each other 
in the postseason.
In their first meeting, the Falcons 
soundly defeated the Tartan squad 
by a lopsided 4-0 score. This season, 
however, the CMU contingent 
showed the experience they had 
gained since last season, as the game 
was ultimately decided on a penalty 
kick in overtime.
With a solid core of talent, though, 
and valuable experience to draw on, 
the Tartans seem poised to make a 
solid run next season. The team will

Painter and first-year UAA Rookie of

team. Second places were brought 
home by the varsity heavyweight

second place finishes were the varsity

were brought in by the varsity 8+ 
team in the 500 meter dash and the

The womens team had a good 
showing, said womens captain

It was a beautiful racecourse, and
overall the team was jealous of the 
beauty of the course and the access to 
the (rowing) facilities
It was a great regatta, said sopho
more mathematical sciences and CS

for some people, which capped off a 
great year.
Said mens team captain and firstyear ECE student Gary Feigenbaum, 
It was a very successful end of the 
season for most of the team.
There was a little controversy sur
rounding the race. Since they were 
the only lightweight team competing, 
the mens lightweight 4 team was 
forced to race with the heavyweights 
and came in second in their heat, 
good enough to move onto the finals. 
But because they were a lightweight 
team in a heavyweight division, the 
judges did not allow them to compete 
in the finals, which angered the team 
members, despite the fact that most 
lightweight teums tend to be slower 
than heavyweight teams, in part due 
to the fact that lightweight men have
to be under 160 lbs.
The team members argued with 
the judges for some time on the dock 
before the final race and were even
tually denied the opportunity to com
pete.
It was really unfair. We were real
ly unhappy with the judges decision, 
said junior art major Mark 
Wyzsomierski, a member of the light
weight team. They could have at 
least given us the opportunity to 
compete. We could have won.
This Sunday, some of the team 
members will be competing in the 
Mid-Atlantic Championships and end 
their season on May 10-11 the Dad 
Vails Regatta in Philadelphia, which

It was good to go to a small regat

pay off.

Kaleidoscope exhibits BHA & BSA art
Interdisciplinary program displays years work in annual event of honor
by Pearl Goldman
Arts & NgNEs emNAHR
The unique nature of the of Bachelor of Humanities 
and Arts (BHA) and Bachelor of Science and Arts (BSA) 
curriculums warrants an exclusive showing of the com
mon thread that ties both programs: the arts. 
Keleidoscope, now through May 6 in the University 
Center Gallery and the Baker A-level coffee area, 
exhibits the artwork of BHA and BSA students. The 
fourth annual multimedia exposition introduces to the 
Carnegie Mellon community the artistic output of 35 of 
the CFA interdisciplinary clan.
Unlike the departmentalized majors in most curricu
lums, the individual BHA and BSA students tailor their 
majors to comply with their preferred course load, with
in certain parameters. In essence, the CFA interdiscipli
nary structure allows students who crave a specific area 
of study to create their own major by combining a disci
pline in CFA and in either MCS or H&SS. The course load 
is comprised of classes which are of interest to each indi
vidual student so that the major is essentially a con
centration.
It is the only way to get the right mix of background 
and context, said JP Roesch, a junior BHA student con
centrating in visual media studies. Roeschs pursuit of
combining interests in the humanities and film keeps 
him involved with CMUtv along with courses in the 
Center for Arts and Society, the research center affiliat
ed with CFA and H&SS.
Coupled with the digital and fine art on display in the 
UC Gallery and Baker Hall will be the performing arts 
events by students concentrating in music and dance. 
The Purnell Center for the Arts will host an Indian clas
sical dance and music of Bharata Natyam, both events 
sponsored by the BHA and BSA programs.
This [annual show] is the only time that we [BHA 
and BSA] get to show our work together as our own enti
ty, apart from CFA, said Marisa Maclsaac, a senior BHA 
student concentrating in 20th century visual culture and 
the organizer of this years exhibition.
While participation is optional for BHA and BSA stu
dents, seniors are required to show their senior project 
work. Maclsaac extended her passion for the study of 
interaction between art and social change and devised a 
project that showed the interaction between people and 
her home state of Maine. Through research and the col
lection of miscellaneous visual items from Maine resi
dents such as photos and stories, Maclsaac was able to 
explain art as a means of expression.
Through May 6, the tight-knit community of students 
will show give CMU a taste of the unparalleled, unwont
ed college experience.
Alumni turn UC 
into recycling hub
by Gita Yitta
GAupptRNAaR
Carnegie Mellon celebrated Earth Day this year in 
style, unveiling a permanent change to the University 
Center. Facilities Management Services (FMS) hired 
Roger Wei and Ayaka Uchida, 2001 CMU alumni from 
industrial design and communication design, respec
tively, for the expertise needed to create an economi
cal user-friendly recycling station in the vacant 
entrance space across from McConomy Auditorium.
The station was created to call attention to the 
importance of recycling and the obligation to main
tain the environment's prosperity. Wei and Uchida 
took the idea to another dimension when they devised 
a plan to create a center where recycling could be 
enjoyable. Their complementing skills in industrial 
design and communication design combined to 
upgrade the usual recycling area into a depot where 
recycling is learning.
The center, with green flourescent lights highlight
ing the green painted walls that are bordered with 
earthly quotes, is fully equipped, with a bin for any 
kind of rubbish. The center is particularly a destina
tion for obscure items that cannot be recycled in most 
places. Meticulously designed signage provides clear 
directions for the user on how to recycle responsibly, 
both on the bins and interactive green iMac comput
ers. Some recyclable items include transparencies, 
compact discs, batteries, and jewel cases.
In order to succeed in their project, Wei and Uchida 
had to implement some professionalism and perma
nence. If you want to increase awareness, make it 
interesting for the students. Our goal was to make 
recycling easier and basically just simplify every
thing, said Wei.
Originally, the recycling project was intended to be 
a mere kiosk in a corner of the space. FMS had initial
ly hired the pair to create something straightforward, 
but the designers wanted to do more. Realizing a 
potential for the project, they did not want to limit 
their creativity. With the limited budget granted by 
FMS, Wei and Uchida managed to use every square 
inch of the space, down to the designing of the sig
nage and even sewing the cotton pamphlet holders by 
hand. We wanted to expand on design. We wanted 
something that was not as sterile as the rest of the 
University Center, Wei said. At the same time, they 
wanted to stress the importance of Earth. Uchida 
added, Using beauty as a powerful messenger, we 
embraced limitations and opportunities to deliver the 
final design in its simplest form. Through the mix of 
vibrant colors and clean fonts, the designers were able 
to visually bring attention to the environment.
With the help of Alexys Hanczar, a senior industrial 
design student, Wei and Uchida were able to receive 
student criticism as to what would work. Hanczar, an 
FMS intern who works to improve recycling on cam
pus, helped Wei and Uchida with research and orga
nization of the project. Her goal was to bring recycling 
awareness to all parts of the community. We hope to 
implement more centers around campus and improve 
the look of campus, said Hanczar. Among all three, 
there was a general consensus that the recycling pro
gram on campus is inadequate. With more funding 
from FMS, they can expand the recycling awareness 
and make the campus into a hospitable place for those 
who cherish the environment.
The project began on March 22 and took close to a 
month to finish. Both Wei and Uchida worked on 
behalf of their Shadyside start-up business, A23, 
which receives commissions for various design pro
jects throughout the greater Pittsburgh area. [A23] 
brings empowerment to design, because designers are 
often underestimated in society regarding how much 
we can bring to heighten the quality of life, said 
Uchida.
The recycling centers location in the UC does not 
end there. Plans call for situating a smaller recycling 
center in each academic building on campus as a way 
to encourage people to reuse and reduce more often.
Wei and Uchidas project was a culmination of unity 
and awareness. Collaboration between students, 
alumni, and the school is very good, said Hanczar.
Thus far, the team has recieved a number of com
missions. The Pittsburgh Penguins at Mellon Arena 
asked the designers to devise concepts for the use of 
two suites.

I am an American, albeit one who 
is unconscious of his surroundings. 
One is rarely surprised by this. In 
fact, it is actually quite accepted.
I am a film watcher, a generic term 
applied to a nonspecific act. When 
one watches a movie in the theater, 
he often becomes a self-proclaimed 
film analyst. This is a natural 
response to a certain need to criticize 
or approve. The viewer is content 
with having purchased his ticket and 
with having watched the reels specif
ically spooled through the projector 
for his distinct viewing pleasure.
Perhaps he will stoically exit the 
theater, disappointed with the lack of
perspective concerning a voiceless 
cultural background. Maybe he will 
leave stubbornly, his insatiable desire 
for sexual situations and adult con
tent unquenched. Whichever circum
stance, the viewer is undermined by 
social expectations placed upon him 
by his peers. He is forced to repress 
the inevitable boiling-over which 
accompanies his own creative expres
sion. He is broken. And with whatev
er energy he can still muster, he gazes 
toward the heavens, invoking the 
gods of cinema in crying out, Why 
hast thou forsaken me?
With faith and hope, I ventured to 
McConomy Auditorium this weekend 
to gather in a little German culture. 
Kino: Beyond the Wall brought to this 
campus a vision of the country sup
posedly little known to this foreign
audience. Being well aware of my 
nationality, I realized my disadvan
tage. What was to happen if I was 
blown away by this revelation of a' 
new German cinema, with all of its 
understood action, comedy, drama, 
romance, love, and war? Would I be 
forced to complete some half-hearted 
analysis of the films without under
standing their cultural context? 
Would I slide further from the realms 
of consciousness, either damned or 
exalted for having cursed the name 
of the movie gods?
Hope was still a reality, for the 
films shown revealed something to 
me. I will use the film FNEAaRnvf(upaR

Making post-college decisions is 
not easy. However, there is a group 
that doesnt want to take this 
thought-provoking question for 
granted. CMU Future has seen that 
CMU lacks interaction between the I 
departments and is on a mission to 
bring the CMU community together 
with the prospects of developing, 
stronger networking abilities.
The club was first formed in the. 
fall of 2001 by MBA student Warner 
Trey Reeser for the purpose of 
improving interaction among stu-' 
dents.
At the first meeting, 17 people 
represented seven schools, said 
Reeser. Right now [CMU Future] is 
only starting with grads, but we are 
hoping to branch out and form inter
actions between everyone in the 
CMU community.
During happy hour, Reeser stood 
on the winding staircase of Skibo 
Coffeehouse and initiated an exercise 
to get the people out of their individv 
ual groups and into socializing mode. 
The exercise was a card game requir
ing participants to assemble them-h 
selves with those who had the same, 
card face or number. Since most of 
those who come to happy hour were 
already well-acquainted, inquisitive 
looks appeared on various faces*, 
throughout the cafe. However, peo-' 
pie seemed to ignore the cards and 
went on about their conversation.
About half of the people at happyn 
hour participated in taking a card,2- 
said Reeser. About half of those peo
ple actually went out to meet new 
people. This was the first time Ive'1 
ever done an excersise like this and'7 
from it, five people came up to me*' 
and said that they were interested in 
joining CMU Future. From this, Ir 
think the exercise was successful.
It was no wonder that Reeser,j 
decided to make a collaborative 
effort with the Graduate Student

Pittsburgh Symphony highlights music of Michael Hersch
by Aseem Gupta
THEARNbyANEs emNAHR
Once or twice a year, Pittsburghers are given the 
treat of a world premiere at the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra (PSO). Fridays premiere of 
Michael Herschs Symphony Number 2 was cer
tainly one of the great premieres heard at Heinz 
Hall. Before performing the premiere though, the 
PSO performed a past premiere  Christopher 
Rouses Rapture. Completed in January of 2000, 
Rouse dedicated the work to Mariss Jansons, 
director of the PSO. According to Rouse, he uses 
the word rapture to convey a sense of spiritual 
bliss, religious or otherwise. Thats exactly what 
the PSO did with his piece on Friday.
The world premiere of Herschs Symphony 
Number 2 was one of two highlights during the 
evening  the other of course being Mozarts 
Requiem. Hersch delivered to the PSO a solid and 
likeable symphony. It was clearly a modern work, 
but not nearly as jarring as some of the contempo
rary music produced by his fellow twenty-first
century composers. While there were certainly 
moments of the piece that were grating, it was by 
and large a piece that evolved into a truly great, 
modern work. Moments of the work were almost 
poetic and meditative  soothing. However, per
haps Herchs greatest achievement was delivering 
a piece that could be understood and appreciated 
by the audience, rather than a whirlwind piece out 
of touch with audience expectations. Hersch said 
of his most recent work, The symphony, unlike 
my First of 1998  written in one large unbroken 
movement  is in four movements. Similarly 
however, it unfolds without pause, thereby creat
ing the sense of one large gesture.
After the interval, the PSO and the less-frequently heard Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh 
entered to deliver an eloquent and stirring perfor
mance of Mozarts final work, Requiem. The piece 
is perhaps the most mysterious classical work 
every written. According to Mozart, he was visit
ed by a mysterious messenger who asked him to 
commission a requiem. Mozart was asked to not 
try to identify the individual who was commis
sioning the piece. He was supposedly visited
again by a messenger some months later who 
again inquired about the requiem.
While Mozart was perfectly healthy for quite 
some time, contrary to what was depicted in the 
movie C$umaynJ he did begin to fall ill in 1791. He 
told his wife that I know I must die ... someone 
has given me acqua toffana and has calculated the 
precise time of my death  for which they have 
ordered a Requiem, it is for myself I am writing 
this. Mozart abandoned the piece, but came back 
to work on it after he was well again  however 
he again fell sick and died a few weeks later. 
Mozart never actually completed the piece, and 
the Mendelssohn Choir performed an ending by 
Sussmayr. The lore behind the piece only adds to 
its mystery when it is performed. The PSO and the 
Mendelssohn Choir performed the piece excel
lently, and the Mendelssohn Choir was clearly well 
rehearsed. The PSO will travel to New York this 
week to perform Fridays program, and will return 
to Heinz Hall with Mariss Jansons conducting and 
Frank Peter Zimmermann on the violin perform
ing Johannes Brahmss Double Concerto and 
Schumanns Symphony Number 2.
Future is now for grads

through a directory of CMU in order 
to find people with interests similar 
to their own.
I created this program in order 
to facilitate team building at CMU, 
said Yau. Im very interested in get
ting the different departments of 
this campus to work together. I feel 
that [CMU] has the potential to be 
an innovation powerhouse, howev
er this is prevented by interdepart
mental boundaries. CMU Future is 
an organization that is trying to 
make this interaction happen.
When Reeser first started pursu
ing his idea of CMU Future, he took 
the initiative to sit in on seminars 
and talk to people face-to-face 
about their ideas and also how they 
interact with the people around 
them, searching for each individ
uals value behind networking.
I think CMU Future is a very pos
itive thing, said Robotics Institute 
graduate student Bernardine Dias.
Building a bridge between 
Robotics and GSA would definitely 
benefit CMU. The most immediately 
obvious benefit is that when busi
ness people get together with hightech people, it forms solid founda
tions for successful high-tech start
up companies. Of course the longer 
term benefits are that they learn 
from each other about the compo
nents of such companies that they 
dont know, and they make great 
connections in terms of partners 
and employees/employers.
Reeser is still in the process of fil
ing for formal recognition from 
Student Affairs for next year.
His first interdiscplinary project 
for next year is to have various 
departments alternate in hosting 
CMU Future meetings in order 
attract more people to the club who 
are apart of the different colleges.
This will give the organization a 
different flavor without being just 
business oriented, said Yau.

Mellon Arena tried to excite the 
Heinz Company about purchasing 
these two spaces, calling it the 
Heinz Kids Club. What we were 
called in to do was come up with 
ways to best use the highly segment
ed, minimally visible space under 
the theme of the Heinz Kids Club 
and make use of a number of Heinz 
Kids-related products: Ore-Ida, E-Z 
Squeeze colored ketchup, etc., 
explained Wei.
We created concepts to unify the 
space, a color scheme, advertising 
schemes, and a wayfinding system, 
as well as options to make the space 
more visible. These concepts were 
used by the marketing department 
to sell the space to Heinz.
Other assignments include work 
for the Girls Math and Science 
Initiative (producer of Mr. Rogers 
Neighborhood and kids-related edu
cational programs), Kennywood 
Amusement Parks roller coaster 
queue signage, and concepts to help 
the National Science Foundations 
website unify Informal Learning 
sites in conjunction with Dr. Kevin 
Crowley from the University of 
Pittsburghs Learning Research and 
Development Center.
Wei and Uchidas small venture 
has plans of its own.
We will definitely be in 
Pittsburgh for a while longer. We are 
expanding work to other cities but 
our roots are definitely in 
Pittsburgh. There are so many great 
opportunities for young, creative 
people to really make an impact on 
this growing city  and to really 
make a name for themselves, said 
Wei.
We focus on the end-user experi
ence and really make opportunities 
out of what some people might see 
as limitations.

Dear Clueless Male Fool,
As a matter of fact, Clueless, I write a love and rela
tionship column. When people write in with love 
gripes, I, quickly and valiantly, come to the rescue 
with my soul-searing good prose. I guess you should 
have been less vague formulating your problems.
In any case, one thing you definitely want to keep 
in mind, regardless of what your love and relation
ship problem might be, is that you should always try 
be a nice guy. Ive noticed that CMU guys are sophis
ticated, worldly, and witty, but the tragedy is that 
most guys dont know how to be just plain nice. So 
unless youre expressing your fondness and satisfac
tion, you might consider being less expressive. Be 
extremely accommodating to whatever your signifi
cant other might want  that works for all the ladies 
who Im dating. Then again, what doesnt work for all 
the ladies Im dating? Oh just kidding: Im not dating 
any women.
Hope everything works out well.

Dear Polite Sexist,
One of the things Ive tried to do in Love, in 
Theory, is maintain gender equality while promot
ing a sense of masculinity; I also try to be a bit edgy, 
insightful, analytical, and entertaining  at least in 
theory. Admittedly there is an apparent contradiction 
in my gender approach. There really isnt such a thing 
as different. So why have I trod this ambiguous path? 
Well, at CMU theres a lot of attention given to 
women. I hope that I might in some way remind peo
ple that being male is a good thing. Being female, 
thats also a good thing, as most males around here
make abundantly, excessively clear.
The thing is: inasmuch as women at CMU are val
ued more than men, I think at the same time they 
arent as respected. Unfortunately, I even see this 
dynamic operate in my very own, very progressive 
mind even right now as write these very words. The 
result is that meeting women that I respect is uncom
mon; its even a bit more uncommon that meeting 
men I respect. Its sad, but true. Women with empha
sized cleavage, bare midriffs, and exposed G-strings 
dont make this task any easier.
From a love and relationship perspective, people, 
both male and non-male alike, need to get beyond 
those antiquated mental gender barriers if they are 
going to have a meaningful, satisfactory relationship. 
Thinking in a unisex mentality has been one of my 
conscious goals in college. Ive come a long way, but 
my biological instincts, coupled with the social-intel
lectual molds, can still actively impede my ability to 
appreciate women on a human level, to some extent. 
Some decades last longer than others and the assslapping 80s wont entirely die until I do.
So, what to do about this conundrum? Well, first I 
think we should acknowledge that the desexualizing 
approach to gender equality of 1960s feminists failed. 
Even when one tries not to pay attention to women 
sexually, there are still women dressing very sexually 
to get our attention; not necessarily your attention, or 
my attention, but some guys attention (and hes 
probably more of a sexist pig than the both of us). In 
any case, I think that desexualization fosters an atti
tude of sexual repression and alienates people from 
their own emotions.
Instead of taking the sexuality out of your appreci
ation for people, what you want to do is bring your 
appreciation into your sexuality. Denial isnt going to 
help you start appreciating women as people. What 
you need to do is come to terms with your emotions. 
Say to yourself, I like those breasts, or even Nice 
rack! Its okay  were getting in touch with our 
feelings. But dont stop thinking there and start 
ogling. You need to take it a step further and throw 
other, more substantive attributes into your sexual 
appreciation.
What you end up with is neither a desexualized 
mentality or a sex-objectified mentality, but an 
appreciation for a womans intrinsic attributes fused 
with a healthy sexual attraction, which, in the love 
business, is what were really after anyway.

Kino celebrates contemporary German films
KINO, from page B1
G(aa1aRnJ is shot against an amazingly, desolate winter land
scape. An accident severely injures a little girl, and the lives 
of five local townspeople become interconnected as a result. 
This was Tom Tykwers second film before making zyE H(u 
zyEJ and in this story one sees the motifs of fate and coinci
dence that mark his more famous work. The director seems 
to have a preoccupation with trying to demonstrate how 
chance dictates the cyclical paths of our lives. These ideas 
form an amazing resource of material with which one can 
make very entertaining films. After watching this picture, I 
can conclude that FNEAaR G(aa1aRn is a good movie.
I once heard film labeled as art in reference to zyE H(u 
zyE If I am to believe this, then there must be an under
standing toward all film being considered art no matter how 
relevant or arbitrary it may be. H(u is an exercise in non
stop motion: it is energetic and non-linear. It is art in the 
sense that it is intended to be looked at and not drawn into 
a sixty page dissertation. While I watch Tykwers films, 
London is not in the midst of rebuilding its bombed-out 
streets. This is not the Fifth-Generation making commen
tary on the backward philosophy of the Cultural Revolution. 
Kieslowski is not using symbolism in ways to avoid censor
ship. This is not the New Wave.
I do not see German cinema. The Expressionist style 
formed as a result of the first World War and the sort of 
renaissance movement that occurred during the 1970s 
stemmed from resolving the events of the second. 
Filmmakers no longer need to find a unique style in order to 
identify their national cinemas. The fall of the Berlin Wall 
merely opened the German film industry to the global mar
ket. We are in the midst of a period where amateur film
makers define themselves, and the international audience 
beckons the work of the consolidated film art.
What I need to understand as a viewer is that I am not 
American, nor am I German. There is good German cinema,
Jerf Cullers/Photo Editor
A student spray paints the wall near Doherty Hall last week to 
contribute to CMUs tribute to this years German film festival.
but more broadly there is good cinema. I am not the new 
world man. I am not a film analyst. I am nothing more than 
a film watcher. German cinema is not only action, comedy, 
drama, romance, love, and war. It is an indication that we 
must break the preconception of art exclusive to culture. I 
enjoyed the Kino festival because this film is art. And the art 
is impressive.

only had trouble organizing famous people and events, but 
that the students were more than a century off. According to 
Hayes, the fault exists because education tends to depart
mentalize knowledge rather than integrate it. In an effort 
to address the shortcoming, Hayes created a matrix of his
torical events in which he broke history down into time 
intervals (i.e. 1700-1750) rather than subject categories 
(i.e. science, politics, arts) so that students would be able to 
connect events to each other rather than see them separate

Flogging Molly puts the rock back in shamrock
A review of the show, the new album, and an interview with the bands fiddle and tin whistle player
Xr
by Michael Croland
CnnNnAuEA WHRy$ emNAHR
Flogging Mollys hybrid of Irish folk music and 
punk rock has been creating a unique sonic explo
sion since the band formed in California five years 
ago. The group is currently exploding into the 
mainstream, not with generic commerciality, but 
rather with their own distinct sound, hard work, 
relentless touring, and enthusiasm a mixture 
that can only be described as pure human spirit.
Drunken Lullabies, the title track from the bands 
new album, garnered Flogging Molly commercial 
airplay for the very first time last week, at a radio 
station in San Francisco. After Top 10 debuts on 
Billboards Heatseekers and Top Independent 
Albums charts last month with RyEIaE y((ubNanJ 
the band is readying a video for the dynamic cut 
Whats Left of the Flag. The greatest display of 
how far the band has come, though, was dj vu of 
whats always been true. At M last Tuesday, they 
touched the hearts of a packed house, as success
fully as theyve always been able to.
Avoid One Thing and The Slackers performed 
earlier in the evening at M, providing more variety 
of genres for the quasi-punk concert. The Slackers, 
who, like the headlining act, are a seven-piece 
band, preached about indolence and marijuana to 
the beat of pure ska rhythms. Avoid One Thing, a 
self-professed new band and the most definitive* 
ly punk act on the bill, clearly outplayed the more 
renowned ska band. Formed by four Boston friends 
with respectable rsums as a side-project, the 
super-group features Mighty Mighty Bosstones 
bassist Joe Gittleman as frontman. Their epony
mous debut album was released earlier this month.
Although the obscure band has yet to generate any 
buzz in the music industry and was faced with an 
unfamiliar audience, they still put on a welcomed 
and intense show.
Cuo.^/Hy uf \en/ OO/ Dohhy >/'u.nH
In a recent telephone interview, fiddler Bridget Regan (third from right) revealed her favorite Flogging Molly 
songs and talked about the reason behind the bands focus on Irish drinking songs.
Cuo.^/Hy uf \en/ OO/ Dohhy >/'u.nH
New Boston band Avoid One Thing opened for Flogg
ing Molly last week at M with a fun and energetic set 
of sing-alongs.
Avoid One Things repertoire begs the question: 
what constitutes a sing-along song? Their songwriting is far from profound and the fans did not 
know any of the material, but their songs still had a 
sing-along quality. All three string musicians loved 
to contribute vocals as much as possible, engaging 
the crowds attention, and making the numbers 
loads of fun.
Gittleman repeatedly asked for audience partici
pation in a game called Stump the Band. Instead of 
performing requested covers, though, as per the 
explained rules, they launched into a series of orig
inal songs. Currently in its infancy, the band has a 
ton of potential, and songs like Lean on Sheena, 
with its low-tempo start and gradual fun build-up, 
could even generate mass appeal. However, the 
set-closer, the poorly-worded lyrics of BombBuilding Songs, should be avoided in all such 
endeavors seeking success.
Flogging Mollys set had punk energy and a 
dance groove reminiscent of the two opening acts, 
but its tough to subject the band to any compar
isons. The septet opened with Drunken Lullabies, 
with the crowd erupting as soon as the opening 
banjo solo drew to a close. Drinking makes them 
have even more fun, as fiddle and tin whistle play
er Bridget Regan clarified when I interviewed her 
last month. Flogging Mollys not going to stop 
drinking; thats the bottom line! she exclaimed.
While Drunken Lulla-bies is the most vibrant 
punk-like song off the most recent album, many
new tracks became instant crowd-pleasers. If I 
Ever Leave This World Alive might be slower, but 
its highly emotional content made it a beautiful 
masterpiece. Like almost all of the songs, it was 
preceded by vocalist Dave King talking about its 
deep and personal meaning. This song is about 
everlasting friendship, and if such a wonderful 
thing exists, how we all find out at the end of the 
day anyway.
In concert, Flogging Molly played the vast major
ity of songs from both albums, but neglected sever
al gems from RyEIaE y((ubNan Cruel Mistress, 
which features bassist Nathen Maxwell singing 
lead, offers a different flavor to the common theme 
of sea-pirate adventures. I was most surprised, 
however, that The Son Never Shines (On Closed 
Doors) was not included in the bands set list. 
Inspired by Kings exile and subsequent inability to 
visit his widowed mother who was still home in 
Ireland, Regan told me The Son Never Shines 
was her favorite song, serving as the truest reflec
tion of personal struggle.
Like the groups dedication to Irish culture, 
musical styles, themes, and even drinking, 
Flogging Mollys live show was still dependent on 
their roots. Nothing got the crowd jigging and 
moshing, to the point of not being able to distin
guish between the two, like the well-renowned cuts 
from the bands debut album GtussaR More familSee MOLLY, page B5
Students pack up, enjoy a summer ofraunch
by Rebecca Cornelius
GAupptRNAaR 
& Kristin Lala
caRnHEEa( ruEusaR
Its almost summertime, that spe
cial three-and-a-half month period 
when some of us go home to work at 
the local bookstore and brush the 
cobwebs off the Nintendo, and others 
rUn off on sordid vacations with sexy 
friends (wink, wink). Sordid? 
Carnegie Mellon students? Thats 
right. Sordid. Raunchy, uninhibited, 
low-down, and dirty. We asked 
around to see what Carnegie Mellon
students will be up to this summer.
To say the least, no one from CMU 
is starring in an adult movie, and no 
one from CMU is starting their own 
strip club. Amazingly, though, some 
people at this school are actually 
planning to do something other than 
sit in their apartments and program.
Chris Riano, first-year electrical 
and computer engineering major, is 
modeling this summer. He will be 
showcasing the summer season of 
underwear from Victorias Secret. 
You wish. He is really modeling mens 
clothing. Technically, however, he 
will likely be wearing underwear 
underneath his mens clothing, and if 
hes not, hey, thats a nice little 
raunchy addition to ones day.
Shaina Stahl, sophomore civil and 
environmental engineering major, is 
going to Europe this summer. She 
will be studying there, as well as lying 
naked on the beach with a male 
friend who is also abroad. But nudity 
doesnt require going to Europe; 
another distinct possibility is testing 
out the exhibitionist waters in your 
own apartment.
Nate Ferrer, junior business major, 
will be reenacting various battles 
with his Civil War reenacting unit. He 
also plans to take trips to Gettysburg 
on the weekends when no battles are 
taking place. Says Ferrer, Down with 
the rebels. How does this constitute 
raunchiness? Well, to be frank, it 
doesnt. However, one junior we 
questioned who wished to remain 
anonymous said that in high school, 
the first hotel she ever ran off to with 
her boyfriend was located in none 
other than Gettysburg, PA. She says 
when she finally called her parents, 
she made sure to use a calling card 
with less than two minutes on it: Hi 
mom, dad, Im great. Okay, cards 
gonna die, see you later. <click> If 
this doesnt convince you, remember 
all the cannons in Gettysburg. 
Cannons are powerful and shoot 
things off.
Julie Schessler, junior professional 
writing major, is going on an African 
Safari. When asked why she wanted 
to, she replied, Lions and Tigers and 
Bears, oh my! Then she will return to 
Pittsburgh and resume an uninterest
ing life. That makes me wonder why 
no one ever markets lion or bear lin
gerie. You always see outfits like 
leopard print see-through nightie 
or tiger striped thong, but no lions 
or bears.
Dave Wiedl, junior information 
systems major, is coincidentally also 
going on an African safari this sum
mer. He, however, has no interest in
lions, tigers, and bears. He said that 
he wanted to find a three-toed sloth. 
Someone should probably tell him 
that the three-toed sloth is indige
nous to Brazil. This is neither here 
nor there, however, because sloths 
are not sexy. A suitably raunchy 
answer would include dancing naked 
to a tribal drum beat or something. 
Bzzzz, youre out.
Eli Padell, first-year mechanical 
engineering major, is going on a 
cruise for a month with the Navy. 
They are leaving from Norfolk 
Virginia, and when asked about the 
destination, Eli said, I dont know 
where I am going, just cruising 
around. Typically, the word cruise 
brings to mind old people in sequins 
stuffing their faces at all-you-can eat
buffets on the Royal Caribbean. 
However, this cruise is with the Navy, 
so its likely that work rather than 
leisure may be involved.
Leigh Anne Sedor took an intern
ship for the summer at FedEx, in the 
sales and development department, 
located in Moon Township. Later in 
the summer, she is going to Dublin 
with sophomore Abby Sturges, 
design major, for the memorial golf 
tournament, to work with all the pro
fessional golfers and their caddies. 
The first part of the summer 
undoubtedly has the bigger raunch 
potential. I can just see the porno

to find a way to unlock it. For some 
people, that entails flying to Europe 
to go nudie. For others, a simple

To everything there is a season. 
And ever since jutnJ GAuR FuRnJ and 
T(Hna eEvHyEAaRn Hp Afa 7fNRm NEm 
dominated the summers of the late 
70s, summer has been the season 
for big-budget thrillers. As usual, 
the studios are marching out their

dying to see if Beyonce Knowles 
can hold a candle to Heather 
Grahams fine acting? Or how 
about zaNsE Hp WNRa? Will the 
human race survive the attacks of 
fire breathing dragons? We just

story: studio spends mucho bucks,

summer guide will save you some

GOOD BETS: There are, believe

An epic series of movies only comes along once, maybe twice in a life
time. Its the type of movie that is so visually engaging it takes your breath 
away, has a deep story that involves you to the very core of your being, and 
has memorable characters that make you feel like you know them. Its the 
kind of story that makes you want to see it over and over again. You can 
replay it in your mind while you sleep. Some movies we are so fortunate to 
have seen that we can merely count our blessings that we have been graced 
with their presence. Stories that will make you laugh, cry, feel joy, sadness, 
anger, lust, betrayal, sloth, envy, and many other emotions. But Im young, 
and those movies havent been made in my lifetime yet. Instead we haveGy1aR$uEJ Gy1aR$uE LLJ uEm Gy1aR$uE LLLJ which, on the whole, isnt bad.

Storytelling 
hqErmAu7( Pu7 j
Once upon a time, there was a young knight. High Lord Tartan had 
ordered the knight to preview the weekends entertainment, but, alas, 
the knight could not find any information for Thors Days entertainment. 
To solve this problem, the knight and his squire visited the local apothe
cary and procured a medium-priced case of incapacitation potions. Afterjc^ 
consuming a sextet of these, the knight felt prepared to examine the 
entertainment. But, alas, no one in the kingdom knew anything about it. 
After resting for the evening on his squires couch, the knight took his 
steed back from the squires home in South Oak Land and returned to his 
abode. Yet he was still puzzled. He pondered the dilemma all day, except 
during a brief lunch break, and still he did not find his answer. He con- 11 
suited with his fellow knights:
Knight: Verily, hast thou heard of GAHR5Aa((NEs?
Sir Seabass: Nay, good knight, I hath not. Who brings this entertainment 
to us?
Knight: It is from the director of ou11NEann and Fa(vH$a AH Afa 
H((fHyna. jj
Sir Seabass: But, good sir knight, what actors bring this to us?
Knight: It stars Lady Selma Blair.
Sir Seabass: Did she not kiss Buffy in that other movie? I shall see this n 
GAHR5Aa((NEs Maychance it has a similar scene.
11
And so the knight had his solution. He would tell the High Lord Tartan 
of Lady Blairs kiss with Viscountess Gellar and hope the possibility of hotgirl-on-girl action would sate the High Lord. The End.

The first thing I dislike about the French is their language. Look at it, up 
there, gloating at me, as if to say Haw, haw, Monsieur American, you can
not read me! For all I know, that is the title of this film. Although I cant 
be certain, I know the characters in the film are mocking me. Sure, the 
subtitles might make it look like theres a plot. But I know the truth. The

Black Hawk Down

Not since G(u1nfHA^ has there been such a fantastic story about hockey. 
Josh Hartnett plays a Chicago Blackhawk forward injured by an errant 
hockey puck to the throat. After an experimental surgery gives him a new 
bionic neck, he struggles to cope with his new, metallic voice and not play
ing hockey anymore. He cant even sit in the stands and taunt the 
Blackhawks opponents because his bionic throat makes him sound like an 
answering machine. All the doctors tell him hell never play again, but he 
forges ahead, pushing himself harder, yelling at them in his crazy robot 
voice. I dont want to spoil the ending, but Hartnett does learn something 
about love, life, and himself.
Also, it is my understanding that this film features a lot of very good 
hockey fighting scenes. Apparently the Blackhawks in this movie are akin 
to the Chiefs in G(u1nfHA^ Many of the reviews of this movie go on about 
how realistically portrayed the fighting is. I wouldnt have thought it 
would be that hard to recreate a hockey fight, but I guess cinematography 
is tougher than I thought. At least we can get a good, intense look at the 
hard lives of hockey goons and cyborgs in this movie. Add a monkey and a 
ninja, and this might be the best movie of the year!

The biggest piece of news last week in the music world has to be the 
announcement that David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar are touring 
together this summer. (Now, if you are reading this and you dont 
ki^ow who Im talking about, calmly put down this paper and walk to 
the nearest record store. Go straight to the real rock section, bypass
ing Matchbox 20 and other poofy haircut bands, and pick up Van 
Halen II. Then, cancel any appointments for the rest of the day.) The 
vqryldea of these two rivals touring together is too tantalizing to pass 
u>. To be honest, I never cared for Van Hagar, but the chance to see 
MJr. Lee singing the classics is something Ive dreamed of for years.

Bgtter than the very best
[ Hatebreeds newest album, caRnagaRaEvaJ holds up to the bands stan| dards and sends a message of hope out to young fans.
Hatebreed
caRnagaRuEva
Universal/Stillborn
wcaRnagaRuEva4usuNEnA u(( H11HnNANHE4TRynfNEs u(( (N$NAu. 
ANHE4cyRa nARaEsAf AfRHysf nH(NAyma4 NnvN1(NEa uEm maAaR$N3
EuANHE? from the title track on Hatebreeds caRnagaRuEva
The music speaks for itself. In a world full of mixed mes
sages, with kids lured by advertising that tells them to look 
like everyone else, Hatebreed stands out. Metal has always 
laughed in the face of conformity and has always stood out 
as a beacon to the disenfranchised. To those who dont 
understand, metal is just pure anger that is at best cathartic, 
and at worst, widens the gap between its fans and the rest of 
society. Well, to those of you who believe this, Hatebreed is 
better than the very best.
Uncertain of how to act, how to deal, kids (mostly adoloescent males) turn to music to understand themselves and 
maybe find solace in the fact that others feel the same way. 
But the music has to be sincere as well as raw to capture their 
attention. caRnagaRuEvaJ like its predecessor GuANnpuvANHE Nn Afa 
auAf Hp anNRaJ succeeds in drawing attention. The music is 
tight, precise, focused, and yes, angry. But behind this, in the 
lyrics the message is sent forth. And that message is simply 
that pain is a part of life, confusion is a part of life, and sadly 
love isnt always present when it should be.
Metal-core, a hybrid of metal and hardcore where 
Hatebreed finds itself at the forefront, is pushed further with 
this album. Large, bombastic beats combined with aggres
sion. To me, this has always been the future of metal. 
Happily, there has been an embracing of this new genre by 
the mainstream metal community. Bands like Slayer and 
Motorhead have taken Hatebreed and Diecast on tour with 
them. (In fact, check out Slayers Kerry King on Final 
Prayer.)
Primal Fear
i(uvI GyE
Nuclear Blast
Ever wonder what Judas Priest would have sounded like if
Rob Halford had stayed with the band after cuNEIN((aR? Well, 
worry no more!
Some pundits will say that Primals last album, dyv(auR 
WNRaJ was that album, but this one is so much closer! The gui
tars squeal like Glenn Tipton, the voice, AfuA gHNva is so famil
iar. I know this comparison isnt fair to either band, but in 
any case, this is fantastic metal, played the way it should be: 
loud. The songs are chock full of solos, evidence of the musi
cianship that goes into their craft. My personal favorite on 
this album has to be Revolution, and it stands rightfully 
beside anything Priest has ever put out.
Killswitch Engage
C(Nga HR jynA iRauAfNEs
Roadrunner Records
In a music scene overcrowded with musicians trying to 
please everyone it is hard to understand why yet another 
band attempts to incorporate fragile melody with Hardcore 
and Metal. However, Killswitch Engage does it well and sin
cerely. With C(NgaJ their first for Roadrunner, these under
ground darlings do what they do well. There are times when 
listening to this record that you feel their confusion, fragility, 
and rage. To make the listener run this gamut of emotions is 
unfair and challenging, but worth it. As an example,' 
Without a Name is as gentle as a lullaby, enough to make a 
tattooed bulldog cry, and caps off the ten cathartic tracks 
preceding it. Then it bleeds into the last song, Rise Again, 
only to take us on the roller coaster again. After this album, 
you will be spent. The overall message is positive, again chal
lenging listeners to see if they truly are alive or are just bare
ly breathing. The lyrics of Rise Again particularly provoke 
listeners: In this life we will rise/if we find the strength to 
unify/hatred is a weakness, you become the victim/I believe 
love will overcome....
Thats it. Do yourself a favor, go see Down, go see 
Meshuggah, go see Manowar, go check out what youre miss
ing, and enjoy a beautiful summer.

flogging Molly, 
those salty dogs

MOLLY, from page B4
_J--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Iiar with the older lyrics, fans 
screamed along to the choruses and 
most verses. Foot-stomping jig-core 
hit its absolute epitome with the 
iritense ditties Salty Dog and 
Devils Dance Floor.
| Black Friday Rule is in a catego
ry by itself as the pinnacle of every
thing that is Flogging Molly: brilliant 
musicianship, gut-wrenching and 
hpnest tales inspired chiefly by Kings 
ejtile, and a terrific dance vibe. They 
played an epic, 12-minute rendition 
of the song, which is already seven 
linutes in its recorded version, com
pete with hand gestures, solos, the 
drinking classic Ole, Ole, and hes^ys-she-says banter. Most notable 
was the bridge, in which the band 
gradually worked itself down to only 
drummer George Schwindt and guitarisi Dennis Casey, playing fero
ciously enough to comprise an entire 
bjand. At this time, King took centerstage again to launch his own zealous 
jig, while the other four musicians 
reached for their beloved Guinness, 
the admission price would have been 
worth it to just witness this one song.
[ Art in its supreme form is a mirror 
o>f real emotion and experiences, and 
no musicians create such wonder like 
Flogging Molly. Behind the jigs, the 
expletives, and the stout, youll find 
devSted artists who capture their love 
f>r frish heritage in song, with plenty 
ojf universal appeal. Nevertheless, the 
septet is committed to spreading their 
music at all levels. After the show, 
Schwindt, accordion player Matt 
Hensley, and banjo player Robert 
$chmidt eagerly signed autographs 
far the fans and answered questions. 
Flogging Molly is a touching experi
ence. As King once said, Anybody 
who has a beating heart in their chest 
can relate to what Im singing.
Summer movies offer trashy sequels and large breasts
PREVIEWS, from page B4
GAuR FuRn e1NnHma LL CAAuvI Hp Afa T(HEan (May 
16): While the first installment (well, technically 
the fourth) of GAuR FuRnJ titled 7fa cfuEAH$ 
raEuvaJ blew by all accounts, early reviews by 
fAA144tttuNEANAvHH(EatnvH$ and 7N$a 
rusuqNEa suggest that CAAuvI Hp Afa T(HEanJ despite 
its poor title, will set the series back on track. 
Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are said 
to have good performances. But most important
ly, get ready for the little guy to finally show what 
hes made of. Yeah, thats right. Yoda kicks ass.
rNEHRNA5 za1HRA (June 21): Steven Spielbergs 
first project since CL CRANpNvNu( LEAa((NsaEvaJ this 
films plot revolves around Tom Cruise, a police
man of the future in the Precrimes Division, 
where crimes and their perpetrators can be deter
mined before any foul play occurs. But Cruise 
himself becomes the hunted and is a fugitive for a 
crime he never committed but may in the near
future. The trailer looks incredible, and it seems 
Spielberg has another classic.
IFFY: The quality of these movies is hard to pre
dict. Some wont be as good as their trailers make 
them out to be. Others will have to be much, 
much better.
ium TH$1uE5 (June 7): In one of the most 
unlikely (and frankly, just plain odd) pairings in 
recent memory, Chris Rock teams up with Sir 
Anthony Hopkins in a CIA comedy, where fishout-of-water Rock is replacing his deceased twin 
to finish a secret project. Who knows? Maybe 
Hopkins and Rock will have onscreen chemistry.
GvHHb5 HH (June 14): This is one of the most 
anticipated films of the year, mainly because 
Scooby and his gang have attained cult status, 
and fans dont want the Scooby name to be tar
nished. Will it be? The casting of Sarah Michelle
Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. (he dyed his hair) 
got mixed reactions, but the computer graphics 
Scooby Doo looks great, and its rumored that the 
movie pokes fun at itself by referencing rumors 
about the show including marijuana use, Velmas 
lesbianism, and that weird ascot that Fred always 
wears.
zaNsE Hp WNRa (July 12): This looks to be the spe
cial effects extravaganza of the summer. Set in 
the future, giant, flying, fire breathing dragondinosaurs have taken over the earth, and 
Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey are 
set on rebuilding human society. This movie, of 
course, is brimming with Oscar potential, 
(cough) Its just hard to look at Christian Bale 
without thinking about datnNan
AVOID AT ALL COSTS: You will see lots of com
mercials promoting these movies. Their stars will 
appear on MTV. Your friends will offer you tick
ets. But whatever you do, dont go!
raE NE i(uvI l (July 3): The first one 
wasnt that great. But people went to 
see it anyway because Will Smith was 
in it, and it was heavily advertised. So 
the studio saw the huge profits and 
yelled Again! Will Smith and Tommy 
Lee Jones (But his characters memory 
was erased! Oh, yeah, thats right, his 
career is suffering.) reprise their roles 
as J and K and are ready to kick some 
butt. Does anybody care? Hopefully 
not, but the movie will probably be a 
hit anyway. If you are a traitor and are tempted to 
go, just go to see Michael Jacksons cameo.
CynANE cHtaRn NE ,H(m$a$baR (July 26): 
Further proof that Mike Myers is a total sellout. 
Okay, so Dr. Evil is funny, and Fat Bastard is the 
most hilarious baby-eater in movie history, but 
they show every funny moment in the previews, 
and then the movie is really stupid! And come on, 
Mike. Do I make you horny? Okay, okay, we get 
the damn joke. This movie may be enjoyable if 
you live in a panic room for all of June and July, 
but even then, the jokes will likely be stale.
7fa NgNEa GavRaAn Hp Afa ]u.]u GNnAaRfHHm (June 
7): Warner Bros, has been trying to argue that 
this movie is not a chick flick, but are there any 
men in the cast? Lets see ... Maggie Smith, Ellen 
Burstyn, Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd, Fionnula 
Flanagan ... yeah, didnt think so. While the cast
zaNsE Hp WNRa should be the summers major special

rebuild society without lots of fake explosions.
has some acting talent, the premise is that 
Bullock has been long estranged from her mother, 
but when she receives her mothers diary in the

together. Pass the Pepto.
7fa NgNEa GavRaAn Hp Afa ]u.]u GNnAaRfHHm just cant be

Cirque du Soleil heads to Pittsburgh: acrobatics and balancing acts
% Andrew Lala
!yanA FRNAaR
I *I* The ever-popular Cirque du Soleil has become one of 
the; most world-renowned circuses. Initially a small 
group of street performers, they formed Le Club des 
talons Hauts (The High-Heels Club) and created their 
(}wg: festival, which they called La Fte foraine de Baie^aint-Paul. Each of these entertainers shared one com
mon dream, which was to amuse spectators, travel across 
the globe, and to have a little fun doing what they loved. 
i Beginning in Montreal, Canada in 1984, these masters 
of the arts have traveled to over 130 international cities 
4nd-have had close to 30 million audience members in 
t^hepast 18 years. Currently, Cirque du Soleil runs seven 
shows; in May, Quidam is coming to Pittsburgh. The 
professionalism and quality of their shows have earned 
them countless decorations, including the distinguished 
Emmy award.
 Being a menial circus fan, I have found that Cirque du 
oleil is one of the most entertaining groups of perform
ers under one tent. Even though I have only seen 
Saltimbanco on the Bravo channel, the comedic relief 
and merriment was well worth the time and would have 
been worth every penny, had I had the means to attend 
the show in person. Time and time again, I am amazed by 
ijhe performers who are involved in Cirque du Soleil, as 
they are incredibly talented, ranging from mesmerizing 
downs to dazzling jugglers. Saltimbanco features 
ozns of entertaining stunts put to the sometimes odd 
yet'.inelodic sounds of their singers.
I A3 if the performers and the singers werent entertain^ng'fcnough, the complex and eye-catching costumes add 
p the quality of every show. For example, one of the male 
jugglers appeared to be wearing nothing but an extreme
ly small Speedo, when in fact he was wearing a full suit 
made to look like he was exposed. Another way Cirque du 
$oleil catches the eye is through the props and sets used 
during the shows, which produce a brilliant atmosphere
and a variety of moods in the tent. These perfor
mances are more like food for your senses than just a 
circus of entertainers.
Looking back at when I saw Cirque du Soleil on tele
vision with my younger sister, I can still remember 
how awesome it was to see the stunts being per
formed. One of these acts involved balancing several 
people on objects while performing numerous jug
gling or acrobatic tasks. Naturally wanting to see how 
it could be done, I tried it with my sister. 
Unfortunately, as you can imagine, these tasks appear 
to be a great deal easier than they actually are. As I 
later figured out, these acts can be dangerous to your 
sisters or your own health. In fact, it is amazing how 
they do not end up killing themselves doing some of 
these death-defying routines.
Compared to a few circuses I have been to, Cirque du 
Soleil ranks as the best. The unimaginable and seem
ingly impossible become reality in each of their shows. 
Amazing millions of audience members, over 2,100 of 
these performers strive for one thing: your undivided 
attention and amusement. Whether youre sitting in 
front of the television and there is nothing to watch, or 
are looking to be astonished, check out Cirque du 
Soleil on television, or go see the real deal when it vis
its Pittsburgh, starting on May 9.
As a preview to the circus, the Carnegie Science 
Center is currently featuring TNRkya my GH(aN(  
jHyREa5 Hp ruE in the Omnimax Theater.-It will run 
through June 16.

Ah, what a semester its been, full of such happy memories. 
Comics. Ducks. Comics featuring ducks. Death-dealing zom
bie ninja hordes of undead ducks. Well, full of memories, anyway. 
But my thoughts now turn to the future of Tartan Comics: Who 
shall bear the torch of greatness into tomorrow? Preserve the tra
dition of excellence into the next academic year? Carry the prover* 
bial big heavy rock to the big proverbial hole into which the 
proverbial rock is dropped? So maybe theres no proverb with big 
heavy rocks. Sue me. But after you do, dream up great comic ideas 
for next semester and email jcreed@andrew.cmu.edu.
