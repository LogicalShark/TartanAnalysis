Focused Research Awards grant professors $2 million for study
SABRINA PORTER
. Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon profes
sors were big winners with 
Google last Tuesday, receiving 
three of Googles 12 first-ever 
Focused Research Awards. 
The awards totaled $5.7 mil
lion, of which Carnegie Mel
lon professors received $2 
million in funding. The grants 
are unrestricted, set to last for 
two to three years, and come 
with access to all of Googles 
technologies.
The three winning Carn
egie Mellon research teams 
were all awarded funding for 
different areas of specializa
tion. Google has identified 
machine learning, privacy, 
use of mobile phones as data 
collection devices, and energy 
efficient computing as four 
areas in which the company 
is interestied in encouraging 
new research.
Tom Mitchell, head of the
machine learning depart
ment; William Cohen, associ
ate research professor in ma
chine learning; and Christos 
Faloutsos and Garth Gibson, 
both professors of computer 
science, were awarded $1 mil
lion over two years for their 
plans to create the worlds 
largest Internet database. The 
grant comes with a possibility 
of an extra $500,000 toward 
the end of their project, after 
a review.
The team plans to extract 
as many as 25 million facts 
from the Internet to contextualize in their database.
The long-term goal of 
this work is to collect large 
amounts of common sense 
information from the web and 
make it available. Hopefully 
this will impact how people 
build intelligent programs in 
the future, Cohen said.
The team hopes that their 
database will return answers 
to broad research questions
such as Who is the most fa
mous person related to CMU? 
and Which location in Penn
sylvania stands out from the 
rest and why? according to 
Faloutsos.
While Faloutsos and his 
team focused on searching 
the Internet, another Carne
gie Mellon group zeroed in on 
Internet privacy concerns.
Lorrie Cranor, associate 
professor of computer science 
and engineering and public 
policy; Norman Sadeh, profes
sor of computer science; and 
Alessandro Acquisti, associate 
professor of information tech
nology in the Heinz College 
received $400,000 for their 
work on Internet privacy.
Were hoping to gain im
portant insights into privacyrelated behavior and develop 
tools that will provide nudg
es to help people protect their 
privacy, Cranor said.

For finding information 
quickly, search engines have 
become an integral part of 
our lives.
Carnegie Mellon Ph.D.
alumnus Qi Lu has a mission 
to improve that experience for 
Internet users through Bing, 
Microsofts search engine, 
which was launched in June 
2009.
Lu, president of Microsofts 
Online Services Division since 
late 2008, is heading the com
panys venture into the search 
engine market and, simul
taneously, the competition 
against Google.
Raised by his grandparents 
in a poor, rural village in Chi
na, Qi Lu attended Furan Uni
versity in China, completing 
his bachelors and masters 
degrees in computer science. 
Lu was noticed by a Carnegie 
Mellon University professor 
at a lecture, and, as a result, 
traveled to the United States 
to obtain his Ph.D.
According to Mahadev Satyanarayanan (Satya), Lus 
Ph.D. advisor, Lu quickly be
came known for his work eth
ic, humble personality, and 
dedication to his studies.
At the time when he was 
here as a student, he concen
trated on his Ph.D. research 
and his thesis. He was focused 
and very driven, Satya said. 
The qualities that people 
have stay with them, regard
less of what their roles are in 
industry and academia.
Upon graduating, Lu 
worked as a research associ
ate for Carnegie Mellon, then 
as a research staff member for 
IBM before beginning work at 
Yahoo! in 1998.
Formerly the executive 
vice president of Engineering 
for Search and Advertising 
Technology at Yahoo!, Lu is no 
stranger to competition with 
Google. Despite Googles hold

Amizade Global Service-Learning 
boycotts Ugandan anti-gay law
COURTNEY WITTEKIND
News Editor
Amizade Global ServiceLearning, a Pittsburgh-based 
nonprofit organization that 
offers service-based study to 
students around the nation, 
has recently taken a stand for 
international human rights.
Uganda has been the sub
ject of much debate within 
the international community 
for its negative stance on ho
mosexuality.
On Oct. 14, 2009, a mem
ber of the Ugandan Parlia
ment introduced an Anti-Ho
mosexuality Bill that would 
put into place some of the 
harshest anti-gay regulations 
in the world. Amizade has re
sponded to the Ugandan gov
ernments anti-homosexual 
legislation with a clear and 
decisive move toward justice 
for Ugandan nationals and 
safety for participating stu
dents.
Previously, students study
ing at Amizades Tanzania 
base traveled through Kam
pala, Uganda at the beginning 
and end of the program. How
ever, in response to Ugandas 
anti-gay policies, Amizade 
Tanzania semester site coor
dinators will now meet the 
students in Kigali, Rwanda. 
The change in operation will 
ensure that Amizade does not 
spend money within Uganda, 
and therefore will not support 
an unjust law.
Stephanie Vickery, a Point 
Park University graduate, vol
unteers for an NGO named 
MAVUNO and is currently the 
program facilitator for Am
izades Tanzania site.
Amizades move out of 
Uganda was important not 
only in its intent to display 
sympathy and support for 
criminalized homosexuals, 
but also a means of educating 
the population at large, Vick
ery explained.
Amizades director of oper
ations and African/Caribbean
programs Brandon Cohen 
added that Ugandas human 
rights violations were not the 
only deciding factor in the 
change: The Amizade admin
istration was also concerned 
for the safety of participating 
students.
Were not policy experts, 
but we monitor policy to be 
sure that our volunteers and 
students are safe, Cohen 
said.
When this appeared in 
the news, it seemed to be a 
good opportunity to stand 
and say that were not going 
to engage and give funds to a 
government that supports this 
anti-human rights measure. 
At the same time, we saw it 
as a chance to protect our 
participants and staff  who 
may or may not be homosexu
als themselves  from any 
abuse.

Canceled classes result in loss of instruction, finances
JESSICA THURSTON
Contributing Editor 
MAX HAWKINS
Online Editor
Last Monday through 
Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon 
canceled classes for the first 
time since 2003  and for 
the first three-day period in 
the universitys history.
In a move that might have 
seemed a bit out of character 
for Carnegie Mellon, the uni
versitys administration iden
tified the safety risk inherent 
in a blizzard of the magnitude 
that swept through Pittsburgh 
last week, and put classes on 
hold.
How is the official decision 
to cancel classes made? The 
city recommended that col
leges and universities close, 
and we complied with that 
request, explained Michael 
Murphy, vice president for 
campus affairs, the individual 
who makes the final decision 
to close the school or remain 
open on a snow day.
It is never an easy deci
sion to cancel classes, and it is 
rare that we do so, Murphy 
said in a Feb. 10 e-mail to The 
Tartan. It is certainly not 
ideal to have to cancel class
es, ever, and we hope to get 
the campus back to normal as 
soon as possible.
While the decision to 
close was an important one 
made with the consideration 
of campus community mem
bers safety, three days of
missed classes could mean 
significant money out of stu
dents pockets.
First-year tuition is 
$40,300 and there are 70 
school days in a semester, 
meaning that first-year stu
dents pay roughly $287 per 
day of instruction. Three few
er days of school means about 
$861 worth of instruction has 
been lost  unless those days 
are made up later.
There is no official deci
sion yet from the university 
as to whether the missed days 
will be made up later in the 
semester, but Murphy said it 
would be premature to rule 
out such an option. Murphy 
explained that because course 
syllabi are already designed, 
the handling of missed class 
time is at the discretion of the 
individual faculty teaching 
each course.
While their responses to 
the three-day cancellation 
period are varied, several 
professors are responding to 
the snow days by making lit
tle, if any, change, to their se
mester plans. Professor Roger 
Rouse, an associate teaching 
professor in the department 
of history, has tried to limit 
changes to his original course 
plans. Ive told students 
that well keep to the origi
nal schedule of lectures and 
readings (i.e., that we wont 
drop or postpone later topics 
to go back over what we were

TEDTalks bring ideas worth spreading to Carnegie Mellon
DYLAN MORI
Staffwriter
Each year, Carnegie Mel
lon hosts a variety of panels 
and lectures with the goal of 
inspiring the campus and the 
surrounding community. In 
the spring, Carnegie Mellon 
will continue this tradition by 
hosting a series of lectures in 
a student-organized confer
ence in April.
Carnegie Mellons TEDx 
will mirror the nationally rec
ognized TEDTalks, created 
by Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED), an or
ganization dedicated to what 
it calls ideas that are worth 
spreading. TED was founded 
in 1984 as an American non
profit organization created 
to bringing attention to new 
ideas. TEDs first official con
ference took place in 1990, 
where featured guests were 
invited to share their ideas 
relating to the three themes 
of technology, entertainment, 
and design. Since then, the 
themes discussed in TEDTalks 
have become much broader 
 hosting many insightful
discussions with a series of 
experts, world leaders, and 
artists. Some of the more 
prominent speakers have in
cluded former Vice President 
A1 Gore, Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates, and jazz musician 
Herbie Hancock. The annual 
conferences in Long Beach 
and Oxford bring together the 
worlds thinkers and doers 
who are challenged to give 
the lecture of their lives  in 
only 18 minutes.

In December of 1934, al
most exactly 75 years ago, 
Albert Einstein arrived at 
Carnegie Mellon (at the time, 
Carnegie Tech) to deliver 
what is now regarded as one 
of the most famous lectures 
of all time. Einstein came to 
Pittsburgh as the highlight 
of an important four-day sci

lecture came at the height of 
his fame. He was undoubt
edly a celebrity coming to 
Pittsburgh; he was on the 
front page of the newpaper 
and interviewed by several 
reporters.
For his lecture in Kresge 
Auditorium, 1000 people 
crammed into a room made 
for 400. It was history in the 
making: Einstein explained 
his derivation of the legend
ary equation, E = me2. 75

The grant combines three 
different areas of expertise 
on the part of all three profes
sors, according to Sadeh.
Lorrie has spent many 
years working on the Platform 
for Privacy Preferences and 
more recently on studying 
usability issues, Sadeh said. 
[Acquisti] has been studying 
behavioral biases in people 
in the context of security and 
privacy decision. My personal 
focus has been more on the 
development of technologies 
to empower users to more ef
fectively specify complex pri
vacy policies with a particular 
focus on mobile and social 
networking applications.
The privacy study will in
tegrate behavioral economics, 
human computer interaction, 
and artificial intelligence in 
nudging users toward privacy 
protection mechanisms.
While this team is promot
ing and investigating smart 
computing, the third group of 
Carnegie Mellon professors is

David Andersen and Mor

Andersen spoke very posi

Google. We received initial 
feedback within two weeks of 
submitting the grant, and no
tification of the award within 
a month. Its the fastest grant 
turnaround Ive ever experi
enced. We really enjoyed it, 
he said. Weve both worked 
with Google engineers in the 
past, and were glad to be able 
to continue doing so.
The team plans to use 
Harchol-Balters experience
in queuing theory and Ander
sens past systems research to 
address the scaling problems 
related to creating more ener
gy-efficient clusters.
Data center energy' ef
ficiency is hugely important, 
whether you measure the 
impact in the green of dollars 
or the green of the environ
ment, Andersen said. Hap
pily, its one of those areas 
where you get both of them: 
reduced costs and reduced 
environmental impact.

Cohon offers to help city cope with snowfall

President Cohon has proposed the idea of a university-based task force to help the city figure out how to deal with future weather-related events.
SNOW, from A1
meant to cover this week) but 
that I plan to weave key points 
concerning this weeks topics 
into my next few lectures, 
said Rouse in an e-mail to The 
Tartan.
Rouse acknowledged that 
the decision to cancel was like
ly a difficult one on the part of 
the university administration, 
and that such sweeping deci
sions often have case-by-case 
consequences.
I dont have enough infor
mation to give informed ad
vice about how the university 
should address the problems 
created by the cancellations, 
said Rouse, but my guess is
that the best thing it can do is 
to encourage professors to re
spond in ways that are sensi
tive to the challenges students 
face on a course-by-course 
basis.
Laurie Eisenberg, another 
associate teaching professor 
in the same department, dem
onstrated how even within 
the same academic area, pro-' 
fessors are adjusting distinctly 
to the three-day cancellation 
last week. I will be deciding 
whether to strike one weeks 
topic from the syllabus entire
ly or whether to move more 
quickly than I had planned 
and still fit everything in, 
Eisenberg said.
Students have no idea
how long instructors labor 
over their syllabi, she said.
In the true nature of Carn
egie Mellon, President Jared 
Cohon has proposed the idea 
of a university-based task 
force to help the city figure out 
how to deal with such weather 
emergencies in the future, ac
cording to an article published 
last week in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. The group would 
be composed of Carnegie Mel
lon faculty, staff, and students 
from departments across cam
pus. Pittsburgh City Coun
cilman William Peduto said 
Cohon offered free services 
to design a modernized route 
system, including a feature 
where residents can track
snow plows online.
The offer includes help 
from the engineering and 
computer science depart
ments, the Heinz College, 
and other Carnegie Mellon 
departments. It would take 
several months and collabora
tion between mulitple schools 
to develop a plan that could be 
presented to City Council.
While the task of combat
ing two significant blizzards is 
indeed a mammoth one, there 
is a pervasive sentiment citywide that city officials did not 
do enough to deal with the in
clement weather. We as a uni
versity, and as a city, Murphy 
said, simply cannot risk such 
a situation in the future.
TEDTalks comes to Carnegie Mellon
TALKS, from A1
according to TEDs official 
website, TED is still going 
strong in the U.S., Europe, 
and Asia, with its speakers 
offering new ways to look at 
the world. On TEDs website 
www.ted.com, performances 
from TED events are avail
able to the world for free. 
More than 500 TEDTalks are 
now available.
The nonprofit has also 
created a program known as 
TEDx, which allows other or
ganizations like schools and 
businesses to plan and host 
a conference of their own. 
Carnegie Mellon School of 
Art professor Golan Levin, 
a speaker at a previous TED 
conference, believes it lends 
some profile to what is other
wise a local affair.
A group of students at Car
negie Mellon expressed inter
est in setting up a conference, 
and after much planning, the 
event has finally gotten off 
the ground and is planned to 
take place on April 4, 2010. 
The event will appeal to all 
students regardless of inter
est or major. According to 
TEDs official website, This 
immersive environment al
lows attendees and speakers 
from vastly different fields to 
cross-fertilize and draw inspi
ration from unlikely places. 
Unlike the official confer
ences, which are by invita
tion only, TEDx tickets will be 
available to students, staff, 
and the greater community.
Carnegie Mellon has had 
plenty of interaction with 
TED in the past. The city of 
Pittsburgh hosted a TEDx 
Leadership Pittsburgh con
ference on Nov. 14, 2009, 
which was attended by six 
professors from Carnegie 
Mellon. One attendee, pro
fessor Charlee Brodsky from 
the School of Design, claimed 
that there was never a dull 
moment.
It mixes the arts with hu
manities with the sciences, 
said Brodsky, a professor of 
photography, who repre
sented her vocation through 
a series of pictures set in In
dia. The main focus of her 
talk was the combination of 
pictures and words that had 
been organized in a specific 
order to convey meaning. 
Within the other featured 
talks, spanning topics from 
computer science to poetry, 
she believed that there al
ways seemed to be something 
for everyone.
A Facebook fan page has 
been created publicizing 
of Carnegie Mellons TEDx 
talks, currently sporting over 
800 fans. Several speakers 
have been lined up. Tickets 
will soon be available via on
line reservation.

determined to advance Bing 
as a search engine capable 
of providing help in decision 
making, in addition to devel
oping improved accuracy.
Unlike Microsofts previ
ous experience with static 
software and computer inno
vation, development of Bing 
instead must adapt to a rap
idly changing environment.
The pace at which inno
vation happens in this search 
engine world happens so fast 
that you need to think and act 
differently, Satya said.
Although Bings develop
ment has only* begun, Micro
softs search market share 
has grown from 8 to 11 per
cent since its inception, a 
promising sign of Lus efforts 
 though Google still has 
over 60 percent of the market 
share. These gains primar
ily took space belonging to 
Yahoo! and other lesser-used 
search engines, but they are 
a positive sign for Microsofts 
investment in Bing.
Though they are competi
tors in the market, students 
at Carnegie Mellon recog
nize the unique connection 
between Google and Micro
soft, both as workplaces for 
graduates and as forces on
Carnegie Mellons campus  
offering grants, facilities, and 
funding faculty and sudent 
research.
I think its really interest
ing, since we just built the 
Gates building on campus 
with the donation from Gates 
and Hillman [Foundation]. 
Our campus is really diverse 
with Google and Microsoft 
both being active here, said 
first-year CIT student Bianka 
Roy.
I think its really neat, 
said first-year business ad
ministration major Emily Lee. 
Obviously, right now, people 
like Google better and dont 
really know what Bing is, but 
I feel like, with the developer 
being a CMU grad, it could 
get really big on campus. If 
I had known Bing was by a 
CMU grad, I would probably 
use it.
Microsoft and Lu will face 
years of work in developing 
the Bing search engine, but 
according to his mentors, Lu 
is more than capable of that 
task.
He is one of the most 
driven people I have ever 
known, and his determina
tion to make Bing a success 
is remarkable, said Randal 
Bryant, dean of the School of 
Computer Science.

Rerouted through Kigali, Riuanda due to Human rights uioiations.

In response to Ugandas anti-gay policies, Amizade Tanzanias semester site coordinators will now meet the students in Kigali, Rwanda before continu
ing to the groups base in Karagwe, Tanzania.
AMIZADE, from A1
bine service-focused learning 
with academic courses offered 
through West Virginia Univer
sity.
Graham Hubbs, who re
cently received his Ph.D. from 
the University of Pittsburghs 
philosophy department, cur
rently acts as the on-site pro
fessor for the organizations 
Tanzania base. Hubbs accom
panies students on servicebased trips and also teaches 
two courses in Tanzania: In
ternational Justice and Na
tionalism as well as Interna
tionalism and Identity.
Amizade saw the mat
ter as a human rights issue 
and decided to respond with
what, effectively, amounts to 
an economic boycott, Hubbs 
said. The reasoning was quite 
simple: Amizade did not want 
to contribute to the economy 
of a state that, in its view, was 
heading in the wrong direc
tion on a fundamental human 
right.
The Pittsburgh commu
nity has responded positively 
to Amizades change in op
eration, with many seeing the 
adjustment as a brave step 
toward protecting the equal
ity of Ugandan citizens while 
simultaneously speaking out 
against an unjust govern
ment.
A lot of people might think 
that boycotting seems like an 
extreme reaction. But in a
sense, it seems like, more and 
more, officials arent listen
ing to the people, so boycotts 
and public demonstrations 
become the only way that the 
people can get their atten
tion, said Sara Faradji, a firstyear global studies major.
Vickery agrees that com
municating the organizations 
displeasure to the government 
is a goal discussed at the in
ception of the boycott. How
ever, she also believes that 
the boycott will be seen by the 
Ugandan nationals as an act of 
solidarity.
In pulling out, we are not 
merely trying to send a mes
sage of displeasure to the par
liament, Vickery said. We 
are also saying to the Ugandan
people: Do not be afraid of 
your brothers and sisters. Do 
not be persuaded by hate. Do 
know that among the most es
sential prerequisites for devel
opment and progress are hu
man rights, and our resources 
and efforts must move with 
those persuaded by equality 
in the here and now.
Amizade encourages intercultural exploration and 
understanding through 
community-driven volunteer 
and service focused learning 
programs in 14 communities 
and 10 countries. Since its cre
ation in 1994, Amizade Global 
Service-Learning has helped 
over 4000 volunteers ages 13 
to 83 contribute over 140,000 
hours of service.

When it comes to design, 
nothing beats the elegance of 
nature. Nature is the ultimate 
paradox of simplicity and 
complexity  every feature is 
designed for its function, yet 
most are impossible to recre
ate without highly advanced
technology. Undeterred, the 
NanoRobotics Lab aspires to 
re-create nature in the form of 
robots.
Led by associate professor 
Metin Sitti, the lab is part of 
the mechanical engineering 
department at Carnegie Mel
lon. It consists of a group of 
students working on a variety 
of robots that have been in
spired by nature.
Casey Kute, a Ph.D. student 
in mechanical engineering 
and a member of the Nano
Robotics Lab, described the 
various projects the students 
are currently working on. 
Projects range from particle 
manipulation with an atomic 
force microscope to mag

hummingbird-inspired flier to 
palm-sized wall-climbing ro
bots, she said.

Computer worms: How 
Conficker infects files
ZACHARIAS GEORGE
Staffwriter
Since its detection in 
November 2008, the Con
ficker worm  also known 
as Downadup, Downup, and 
Kido  has spread and in
fected between 9 and 15 mil
lion computers, according to 
reports from CNN and United 
Press International. This 
makes it the largest computer 
worm infection since the SQL 
Slammer from 2003, which 
slowed down Internet traffic 
considerably.
A virus is a piece of harm
ful code that replicates itself 
and attaches itself to exist
ing programs when infect
ing a computer. It usually 
affects certain files on the 
target computer. Computer 
worms, on the other hand, 
are self-replicating computer 
programs capable of trans
mitting copies of themselves 
over a network to other tar
gets. These worms might also 
carry with them a payload 
program, which is capable of 
more malicious attacks than 
simple self-replication and 
transmission.
Most malicious attacks are 
targeted at certain vulnerabil
ities of programs or operating 
systems. Creators of worms 
exploit these vulnerabilities
and program their worms to 
multiply and transmit copies 
to all reachable computers 
that have the same vulner
abilities.
The Conficker worm ex
ploited the MS08-067 vul
nerability in the Windows 
Server and XP operating sys
tems. The vulnerability al
lows computers to transmit 
information between each 
other. Microsoft has since is
sued various patches to fix 
the problem. However, all 
unpatched computers are still 
vulnerable.
The worm has evolved 
over the 15 months it has 
been known to exist. Today 
there are five different vari
ants of this worm, making 
it more difficult to identify 
the total number of infected 
computers or to eradicate the 
worm entirely.
While the first variants re
lied solely on network trans
mission of copies of the worm 
itself, the newer variants are 
capable of replicating and 
transferring themselves to 
other computers via remov
able flash media. These two 
means of worm propagation 
have enabled the Conficker 
worm to infect a large num
bers of computers in two

Alcohol Flush Reaction: A decreased ability to metabolize alcohol
DIPIKA SHRIHARI
Junior Staffwriter
The infamous Asian glow 
is hard to ignore. With as little 
as half a can of beer, a persons 
normal complexion can trans
form into a bright crimson tint. 
This condition is very unique 
in that only a small percentage 
of the population at large actu
ally has it.
Most common among 
Pan-Asians, Asian glow is 
formally called Alcohol Flush 
Reaction (AFR) and has some 
additional symptoms includ
ing nausea, light-headedness, 
and an increased heart rate.
Some people believe that 
Asian glow is some sort of al
cohol allergy. However, this is 
only a myth. AFR is the collec
tion of symptoms that a person 
gets when he or she is unable 
to process alcohol in the body. 
Rather than an allergy, it is a 
genetic trait. It is the effect of 
alcohol consumption by those 
who lack the capacity to me
tabolize acetaldehyde.
Acetaldehyde is a chemical 
that the body converts alcohol 
into during the digestion pro
cess. Acetaldehyde dehydroge
nase is an enzyme in the body 
that is supposed to break up 
this converted acetaldehyde 
into a non-toxic substance like 
acetic acid.
However, when the sub
stance is not converted, it can 
be extremely harmful for the 
body and even be 30 times 
more toxic than alcohol.
When there is acetaldehyde 
in a persons body, the capillar
ies in his or her face and neck 
are heavily dilated, causing a 
deep reddening that is shown 
on the surface of the skin.
People with AFR may also 
experience a heavier hang
over because acetaldehyde is 
also the primary cause of this 
morning-after alcohol induced 
headache. However, when 
there is less acetaldehyde in 
a persons body, it means that 
most of it has been metabo
lized into acetic acid, which is 
relatively harmless.
It is mostly Asians that 
have this problem because of 
a genetic mutation in the PanAsian community that has de
scended through time. Those 
with AFR usually have a varia
tion in their genes that make 
them deficient in ALDH2, 
which codes for acetaldehyde 
dehydrogenase.
This condition is inher
ited from one or both parents 
and is so pervasive because 
it is a dominant trait. In fact, 
about half of all Japanese, 
Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, 
and Vietnamese populations 
have this mutated gene. Even 
when some Pan-Asians have 
enough ALDH2, the mutated
enzyme is still there. In this 
case, the AFR symptoms are 
less dramatic and will usually 
leave the intoxicated individ
ual looking flushed with other 
mild symptoms.
Excess acetaldehyde in the 
body can have detrimental ef
fects. For one, those with AFR 
feel the same side effects of al
cohol intoxication as any other 
person, such as dizziness, 
talkativeness, slurred speech, 
nausea, vomiting, and the 
ever-famous hangover. How
ever, those with AFR have ad
ditional symptoms, such as a 
sudden raise in heart rate, and 
some peoples skin even starts 
to swell. It is important not to 
mistake the unique symptoms 
of AFR with the assumption 
that those people are just more 
easily inebriated.
Another serious problem 
associated with AFR is the in
creased likelihood of getting 
cancer. Because acetaldehyde 
is extremely carcinogenic, the 
likelihood of getting cancer 
after prolonged exposure is 
very high. Philip Brooks, a re
searcher at the National Insti
tute on Alcohol Abuse and Al
coholism in the United States, 
recommends that doctors edu
cate their patients about the 
link between AFR and cancer, 
so people who have this reac
tion can take early preventive 
actions.
For example, those with 
AFR may increase their chanc
es of getting cancer by up to 
600 percent by consuming 
about two cans of beer per day. 
However, not all side effects 
are bad. For example, those 
with this condition are less 
likely to become alcoholics.
Despite these many serious 
side-effects of AFR, the cures 
for this condition remain un
known. This has a great deal 
to do with the lack of random
ized studies.
Some suggest that taking 
Zantac and other such heart
burn medication contain
ing the drug Ranitidine may 
slightly mitigate the effects of 
AFR. Although some people 
have written off this reaction 
as a lifelong problem they just 
have to deal with, others have 
suggested that the repeated 
use of alcohol can slowly 
make the body more tolerant 
to some symptoms. However, 
this is not recommended due 
to the many negative side ef
fects of alcohol itself and the 
increased risk of cancer.
When considering possible 
ways to alleviate symptoms, it 
is important to make sure that 
people do not confuse AFR 
with other conditions with 
similar symptoms. Alcohol has 
also been found to exacerbate 
or trigger other pre-existing 
conditions, such as Red Ear
Syndrome, Rosacea, and De
greasers Flush.
Although Asian glow, 
as the nickname suggests, 
is found mostly among East 
Asians, there have been in
stances in which non-Asians
also have this condition. If you 
consume alcohol regularly and 
think you may have this reac
tion, it is best to consult your 
physician for more informa
tion and alcohol consumption 
guidelines.

Alcohol Flush Reaction, commonly called Asian glow," is caused 
by a genetic mutation. Those affected are deficient in acetaldehyde 
dehydrogenase, which breaks down certain compounds in alcoholic 
beverages.

Google to offer high-speed InternetScientists sequence ancient genomeNASA launches new solar probe
Google announced on Wednesday that it would extend gigabit 
Internet (over 100 times the average speed in the United States) 
to as many as 500,000 people. The company has positioned the 
project as a way of demonstrating to the telecom industry and 
consumers that such improvements can be made at a reasonable 
cost. This move may force existing Internet providers to improve 
their own products. Google, however, does not intend to become 
a full-fledged Internet service provider (ISP).
As a large Internet company, Google has been hampered by 
the fact that its users do not have access to relatively inexpen
sive, fast Internet. Becoming an ISP and any subsequent devel
opments that arise from it are likely to benefit Google as people 
begin to use more and more of its services.
Some areas may have access to this service by the end of the 
year, while others will have to wait longer. Its offering will also 
be different from other ISPs because the network will be open 
to other providers, a practice prevalent in other developed coun
tries, but not in the United States.

The genome of a man who died 4000 years ago in Greenland 
has been sequenced, and the results have provided great insight 
into both minor physical traits and ancient human migration 
patterns.
Found in the 1980s, Inuk, as he has been named by scientists, 
was ignored until recently. Because he was relatively uncontami
nated by modern human DNA, he was a good candidate for ge
nome sequencing.
Studies detailed his various traits, such as a predisposition to 
going bald, and also indicated that Inuk and his descendants are 
not closely related to the people who lived in Greenland in later 
years. Indeed, he is more closely related to people in Siberia than 
to the Inuit and Native Americans.
While Inuks genome is the first ancient genome to be se
quenced, gene sequncing is still fairly expensive. However, the 
cost of gene sequencing technology is decreasing, and scientists 
believe this trend will ensure that Inuks sequenced genome is 
far from the last.

At 10:23 p.m. last Thursday, NASA launched an Atlas V rocket 
carrying the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a probe that is meant 
to study the sun in much greater detail than ever before. As the 
first mission in NASAs Living With a Star program, the probe will 
be used to develop models to predict solar weather patterns.
Many solar phenomena related to the suns magnetic field, 
such as solar flares, have a direct impact on life on Earth. Some 
of the more violent solar activities can damage satellites, disrupt 
power grids, and harm astronauts. Our increasing dependence 
on technologies that can be influenced by the sun means that the 
understanding provided by probes such as this one is becoming 
more and more important.
The technology behind the probe is in the form of three sen
sors that will take snapshots of the sun every 10 seconds and 
measure eight different parameters during each snapshot. This 
in turn will result in an immense amount of data, on the order 
of 1.5 terabytes per day, which will be interpreted in order to 
improve our methods of predicting solar weather patterns.

Computer worms like Conficker take advantage of computer vulnerabilities. With weak password protection, computer worms can easily navigate 
through the computer to replicate itself and infect other files.
WORM, from A5
years. That the Conficker 
worm can gain control over 
computers on a network with 
weak passwords has enabled it 
to infect computers in suppos
edly high-security networks 
as well. The list of infected 
computers includes some in 
the United Kingdom Ministry 
of Defense and the unified 
armed forces of Germany.
Studies by Felix Leder and 
Tillmann Werner at the Uni
versity of Bonn in Germany 
have shown that once settled 
in a computer, the worm will 
try to download updates to its 
software from any of a num
ber of randomly generated 
IP addresses. This program 
might also contain code that 
causes the infected zom
bie computers to perform 
some action. What this action 
might be is not yet known, but 
theoretically it can have cata
strophic effects on national
defense and finance, among 
other things.
The newer versions of the 
worm also appear to patch the 
underlying operating system 
vulnerability so it cannot be 
fixed as easily by updates or 
software, keeping the com
puter open to reinfection.
Anti-virus company Sy
mantec has shown that the 
two latest variants of Con
ficker also use peer-to-peer 
communication to check for 
infected computers before 
communicating with them 
and downloading updates. All 
of these techniques ensure the 
survival of the worm within an 
infected computer by down
loading updates to the worms 
existing software.
Independent studies by 
SRI International and Sy
mantec have enumerated 
the self-defense mechanisms 
that the Conficker worm has 
-in place to protect itself once 
inside an infected machine.
The first variant of this worm 
had no self-defense mecha
nisms, and the next few vari
ants only prevented the com
puter from updating itself and 
thereby prevented patching of 
the vulnerabilities. The latest 
variants disable auto-update, 
disable safe mode, prevent 
the operation of anti-malware 
tools, and also restrict access 
to anti-malware sites, effec
tively rendering the computer 
completely helpless.
While it may seem difficult 
to clean an infected computer, 
most anti-virus companies 
offer a free download of the 
Conficker removal tool which 
can be run from a flash drive.
It is true that the Conficker 
worm cannot infect a com
puter that has been cleaned 
and patched to cover the particular vulnerability that it 
exploits. Microsoft has issued 
this patch, and it is available 
as a free download to all users 
of genuine Windows operat
ing systems. This leaves all 
pirated versions of Windows 
still vulnerable to the worm, 
and this is a particularly press
ing problem in third-world 
countries where most operat
ing systems are pirated.
While this computer worm 
uses advanced malware tech
niques that are well-known 
and researched, its use of 
multiple techniques has made 
the worm particularly hard to 
eradicate.
The creators of the Con
ficker worm have not yet been 
identified, and Microsoft has 
issued a $250,000 reward for 
any information leading to 
their arrest and conviction.
So far, Ukraine is most 
likely the origin of the worm, 
although no hard evidence 
has been produced. In the 
meantime, the only possible 
way to completely eradicate 
the worm is to disinfect infect
ed computers and then patch 
them.
ROBOT, from A5
Mellon press release, an 
exhibit was held at the Mu
seum of Science in Boston 
showcasing this robot.
The innovation that al
lows the robot to climb a 
smooth, vertical wall is called 
dry fibrillar adhesives. The 
geckos trick to sticking to 
surfaces lies in its feet, specif
ically the very fine hairs on its 
toes, Kute said. There are 
billions of these tiny hairs, 
which make contact with the 
surface and create a huge col
lective surface area of con
tact.
Using this as a reference, 
the NanoRobotics Lab cre
ated a synthetic version of 
the geckos toes consisting 
of microscopic fibers with 
special tips that allow them 
to stick to surfaces. The dry 
adhesion force comes from 
surface contact forces such as 
van der Waals forces, which 
act between all materials in 
contact, said Kute.
The Van der Waals forces, 
in this case, are attractive 
forces between molecules 
that come near to each other, 
allowing them to bond, or 
stick, to each other.
While the technology imi
tates a geckos physiology, the 
robot itself looks like a small 
box with circuitry and large 
wires extending from it, as 
recorded on a video available 
from the Museum of Science 
in Boston website.
The box moves by rotat
ing two cross-shaped objects 
connected to either side of 
it. Each of these crosses re
sembles a wheel with four 
thick spokes, without a circu
lar rim around it. The ends of 
the spokes have the adhesive 
material attached.
By rotating the crosses, 
the adhesive can selectively 
stick to walls, allowing for 
mobility. Our robots use the 
principles used by geckos, tut 
do not look like the lizard, 
Kute said.
The team realizes it is bet
ter to not completely imitate 
nature, which has limita
tions. Rather, they base their 
robots on natural principles, 
but develop them further. 
Nature evolves designs that 
are good enough, which is to 
say they function well, but are 
not fully optimized. By look
ing to nature for inspiration, 
we can start with a partially 
optimized model. It allows 
us to move more quickly to & 
fully optimized model, Kute 
explained.
While these robots are a 
technical achievement, cur
rent technological limitations 
still exist, preventing theft 
practical use. Energy is an 
area of technology that is still 
surpassed by nature.
One main technical limi
tation is power. Animals in 
nature are able to metabor 
lize their energy from theft 
surroundings, Kute said. A 
robot has to either carry all 
of its power with it or be teth
ered, which limits its possible 
coverage area.
Another limitation is re
pair. Animals heal without 
the slightest thought as to 
what their body is doings 
but re-creating the healing 
process in robots is difficult. 
Animals are able to self-re
pair and adapt to their sur
roundings. Robots are not yet 
widely able to do this, Kute 
stated.
The robots offer practir 
cal purposes, as climbing ror 
bots can access rocky terrain 
more easily than those with 
wheels. The team already has 
applications of these robots 
in mind. By having small ror 
bots that are able to cover dir 
verse, complex environments 
we hope that they will prove 
useful as knowledge sources 
for hazardous environments 
or places that are too small 
for humans to go. We antici
pate our robots could help 
with pipe inspection, security 
monitoring, and medical ap: 
plications, Kute said.

Administration rightly places community safety first
We live in extraordinary times.
Last week, for the first time since 
2003, Carnegie Mellon University 
canceled classes due to snow. Cam
pus was closed for three days due 
to weather for perhaps the first time 
in its 110-year history. These snowrelated closings and cancellations 
inconvenienced students and profes
sors, administration and staff alike. 
Tests, lectures, and assignments 
must be rescheduled, syllabi must be 
rearranged, and we all must return 
to our normal, blizzard-free lives.
Yet despite the interruption to our 
routine, we applaud the university 
administration for demonstrating
its commitment to the safety of its 
students and employees by comply
ing with the citys request to cancel 
classes.
At a school where missing a single 
day can take a week to make up, clos
ing the campus is not an easy choice. 
But the cost of missed classes is much 
less than that of broken bones or car 
accidents. Rather than putting pres
sure on faculty to brave the danger
ous roads or on students to walk 
down icy paths, the university made 
the responsible choice to accept the 
reality of the citys situation.
It was not Carnegie Mellons fault 
that Pittsburgh received almost 30
inches of snow in six days or that the 
city was woefully underprepared for 
such a storm. In fact, the universitys 
response was faster and more effec
tive than the citys: By Wednesday 
morning, sidewalks across the Cut 
were clear, while Forbes Avenue re
mained a sheet of ice. The schools 
leaders made the right choice in clos
ing offices, not because campus was 
impassable, but for the well-being of 
staff and students living off campus.
While Snowmageddon 2010 has 
come to an end, we commend the ac
tions of an administration that right
ly places the safety of its community 
as a top priority.
Iranians deserve basic rights to privacy, speech
The political climate in Iran has 
been tense since last Junes election, 
and government security has been 
even tighter surrounding the anni
versary of the 1979 Islamic Revolu
tion. However, Iran took its safety 
measures to a whole new level last 
week. In response to threats about 
the opposition staging mass pro
tests on last Thursdays holiday, the 
Iranian government took extraordi
nary steps, including shutting down 
citizens access to Gmail, aiming to 
replace the ubiquitous e-mail service 
with a nationalized  and obviously 
closely monitored  e-mail service. 
Furthermore, the government re
moved satellite dishes from residen
tial homes, severely restricting out
side communication.
This is hardly the first of time the
Iranian government has taken au
thoritarian actions. Prior to this, the 
government had been ruthlessly im
prisoning people and even sentenc
ing them to death for protesting the 
results of last years allegedly rigged 
election. The government has also 
been cracking down on activists, as 
if to root out all opposition by ruling 
with an iron fist.
The news of the Iranian govern
ments oppressive measures is outra
geous. It is shocking and saddening 
to us that today, a time in which de
mocracy is a prevalent and popular 
idea, dictatorships still have power. 
Whats more, the government is 
stripping Iranians of their means to 
fight back  be it their jobs, their 
e-mail service, or their lives. The 
citizens are being threatened from
every direction.
While shutting down Gmail may 
be successful in cutting communi
cation among protesters, and be
tween them and the outside world, 
it is hardly a sensible course of ac
tion. By revoking the Iranians ac
cess to communication channels, 
the government has violated not 
just their freedom of choice, but has 
also curbed their freedom of speech. 
These are basic human rights: privi
leges that belong to every individual 
and should, under no circumstance, 
be revoked.
We greatly disapprove of the Ira
nian governments course of action, 
not just because of the violence that 
it perpetuates against opponents, but 
also because of the inequality behind 
its actions.
Networks have responsibility for commercial content
Eight days ago, on Super Bowl 
Sunday, prime-time football got po
litical.
CBS, the television station that 
presented the game on Feb. 7, chose 
to air a pro-life advertisement from 
anti-abortion interest group Focus 
on the Family featuring Heisman 
Trophy winner Tim Tebow and his 
mother Pam, and rejected a com
mercial from gay male dating site 
www.Mancrunch. com.
The Super Bowl is consistently 
the biggest advertising event of the 
year, even with the Winter Olympics 
closely following the football event. 
In choosing to air one controversial 
commercial over another one, CBS 
politicized the Super Bowl and shut 
out a significant portion of its audi
ence, whether or not it intended to 
do so.
Most of the Super Bowl ads are 
seemingly chosen to appeal to a 
mass audience of about 100 million 
viewers. We see in the rest of the 
commercial planning  ads filled 
with appeals to nostalgia with clas
sic athletes, such as Charles Barkley, 
or celebrities famous across multi
ple generations, such as Betty White
 an attempt to appeal to everyone 
watching the big game.
Thus it seems out of character 
to air a political, staunchly pro-life 
commercial, particularly one with a 
message obscured by Tebow.
We recognize that CBS can run 
whatever commercials it wants; 
it has the right to be selective. But 
while this is true, CBS has a respon
sibility not to discriminate or run 
misleading ads, especially during 
such a big event that reaches Ameri
cans of so many disparate genera
tions.
Moreover, CBS is suffering from 
a lack of transparency following its 
lack of judgment. All statements its 
executives have made to major me
dia outlets about the decision have 
seemed terse and vague. For exam
ple, Jo Ann Ross, president of sales 
for CBS, told Reuters, Theres still 
a lot to be said for live events that 
garner general interest.
Even if the Mancrunch ad 
were inappropriate for prime
time football, as CBS appears to 
have deemed it, the network has 
a responsibility to its viewers to 
clearly explain why that potentially 
controversial commercial was any 
less suitable for the American public 
than the politically charged one 
from Focus on the Family.
Google starts online buzz
Last week, the depths of the In
ternet birthed a new social-media 
love child which the Interweb deni
zens and the falling-out-of-fashion 
blogosphere met with a collective: 
Um, what?
Googles Buzz is a Twitter/Flickr/ 
Picasa/Google Reader mash-up that 
has parasitically taken up residence 
inside your Gmail account. Yes, it is 
one more Internet life-stream, pull
ing in information that you have de
posited around the Web in one place 
for all of your Googly friends to read. 
And this is not a Google Labs feature 
that only the most hardcore of geeks 
will test out  this is something that 
is being rolled out across the entire 
Google digisphere. And with Google 
putting all their weight behind it, it 
is a service to consider very serious
ly. The buzz is here: the best thing 
you never wanted.
Enabling your Gmail account 
with Buzz is ultra-simple. If you 
havent yet begun your Buzz, the 
next time you log in to your Gmail 
account, an intro screen will block 
you with a welcome to the service. 
Regardless of which selection you 
make, either Sweet! Check out 
Buzz or Nah, go to my inbox, 
Buzz is activated. Yes, thats right: 
Both options turn on Buzz. Thats 
what they must mean by no setup 
needed.
Activation is idiot-proof, continu
ing the simplicity-first Google design 
aesthetic (if you are willing to call it 
that) that spans nearly all of their 
products. Setting up which feeds 
you want to pull is as easy as click
ing an Add button. Add Flickr with 
your Flickr account name; add Twit
ter with your Twitter account name. 
Want to load in posts from your 
blog? Not allowed. Want to load in 
your Facebook status updates? Not 
allowed.
Google is taking the control and 
the privacy settings out of your 
hands. You might ask: Is privacy a 
concern on Buzz? It is just pulling 
in your feeds from other places, al
ready accessible. But all of this conLEADERSH1P PERSPECTIVES
tent being pulled in is being read 
by... whom, exactly? In a gesture 
of kindness, Google Buzz helps you 
get started by computing your core 
social network from your Gmail ac
count and automatically having you , 
follow them publicly on Buzz. Ever 
had an e-mail conversation with 
someone that you didnt want the 
whole world to know you were talk
ing to? Oh well, now they do.
Google is responding quickly. 
The product launched on Tuesday, 
and by Thursday they had already 
officially (via blog) addressed the 
concerns and rolled out a first set 
of changes  changes which are a 
good step, but are only a rudimen
tary start already two days too late.
More importantly, we should 
think about our ever-shifting Inter
net presence. When I now update 
my status, do I do it on Twitter, 
on Facebook, on Buzz? Do I want to 
tell my Twitter followers the same 
things I tell Facebook? Are my ac
counts protected? Do I want Buzz to 
know everything I tell everyone? Ac
cording to Google, there were over 9 
million posts on Buzz, but certainly 
the great majority of Buzz informa
tion wasnt created with Buzz; it was 
imported.
Tim Maly has begun an 
effort called Unlink Your Feeds 
(unlinkyourfeeds.tumblr.com), a 
call for sanity from the new trend 
of dumping all your content from 
one site to another and beyond. 
This is a brilliant effort to solve a 
serious problem that Buzz is only 
exaggerating.
Google, in its lack of anything 
near real time, is trying to jump in 
to have its own version of Facebook 
status, its own tweets. The buzz is 
just one new real-time noise among 
many. But worse, it currently consists 
of repetitive content chained across 
the Internet. This is the future death 
of current social networks, when 
all of the content is stale, made for 
a different group on a different net
work. Any sort of personal touch is 
lost and we are left with just echoes 
across the wires.
Patrick Gage Kelley (pkelley@) is 
trying to hear harmonies in the inter
noise.
SWE celebrates engineers
CHRISTINE ANDERSON 
CATHARTZELL
The Society of Women Engineers 
(SWE) takes the opportunity every 
February to collaborate with several 
groups across campus to celebrate 
the success and hard work of engi
neers. This year, National Engineer
ing Week (E-Week) will be held Feb. 
12-20, with the main theme being 
Engineering through the Ages.
The goals of these events are to 
emphasize the development and 
growth of engineering through the 
years, show how interdisciplinary 
teams work together to solve prob
lems, and demonstrate the many 
ways in which engineering impacts 
our lives and the lives of people 
around the world. .
In addition, the events aim to en
gage the campus community with 
engineers and their projects. By do
ing so we hope to excite, educate,
and encourage others to explore and 
develop a greater understanding 
and appreciation for engineering.
E-Week events are scheduled for 
each day this week. These include 
exhibitions like the tech showcase 
and ice cream social Monday night 
and the design competition Thurs
day afternoon. There are social 
events, like the Engineering Carni
val this past weekend, the Dinner 
with 19 Tartans this Thursday night, 
and the first-year networking event 
Wednesday night. E-Week concludes 
with the Mr. Engineer competition 
Friday night in Rangos Hall.
Each of these events is open to 
the entire campus. Events include 
free food as well as several prizes do
nated by Microsoft to be raffled off. 
A full schedule, as well as explana
tions of each event, can be found at 
www.cmu.edu/swe. If you have any 
questions, please feel free to contact 
Christine Anderson (clanders@) or 
Cat Hartzell (chartzel@).
Along with engineering organi
zations, additional sponsors include 
Schlumberger, Microsoft, Apple, 
SDC, Gelfand Center, CIT Deans 
Office, and the Alumni Association. 
We would like to thank the campus 
community in advance for their sup
port of E-Week.

Chronicling fantasy sports victories and woes: My story
I actively participate in fantasy 
sports. Maybe its to make up for the 
fact that I dont vote in local elec
tions, havent watched every episode 
of Jersey Shore, and regretfully let my 
ceam down in IM co-rec badminton. 
(Sorry, Ben.) Fantasy sports are my 
way of engaging in representative 
popular culture in a competitive for
mat. Either that, or getting excellent 
training in becoming a bookie.
I convinced a few fine young firstyear gentlemen to register for fantasy 
figure skating in light of the Olympic 
year, and in exchange I registered 
for the official NFL Fantasy Football 
Playoff Challenge. Early signs of bit
ter competition quickly appeared: 
On the eve of 2010, instead of wish
ing me a happy new year, my friend 
Jason ominously declared, This is 
the year I defeat you in fantasy fig
ure skating. Ive never felt so threat
ened.
Fantasy figure skating works 
somewhat differently from fantasy 
football. Skaters in each competition 
are divided into three broad catego
ries based on international rankings. 
You pick your presumed best in each 
category, considering factors such 
as the specific competition, time of
year, technical ability, artistic abil
ity, nerves, and number of sequins 
on costume. You do this for ladies, 
mens, pairs, and ice dancing. Based 
on these selections, you are ranked 
among all other players for each 
competition. Considering that there 
are around seven or eight rounds 
of this before the Olympics, fantasy 
figure skating is more than your av
erage laughable pastime  its one 
hell of a full-out endurance-based 
competition.
The process is so complicated that 
a friend who knew a decent amount 
about logic, probability, and pro
gramming offered to write a program 
that would weigh in all these options 
and generate the optimal selections 
for each competition, thereby help
ing me to my victory. I was thrilled. 
However, after hearing that he had 
to factor in sequins and density of 
makeup, he abandoned me and my 
endeavor to do more serious things, 
such as working on his Area of Effect 
in World ofWarcraft.
I asked some of the guys what 
their strategies for picking obscure 
figure skaters were. Peter mulled 
over his online ballot and pulled up 
a world map in a new tab, proclaim
ing that he was going to pick skaters 
from countries that were the closest 
to the equator. Dave resigned himself 
to picking skaters with the weirdest 
names, adding Ari-Pekka Nurmenkari and Rockne Brubaker to the mix. 
Adam Wikipedia-ed pictures and es
sentially picked the hottest ones.
Yeahhh, Sasha Cohen!
Jason, my biggest threat, picked 
singles actually based on internation
al rankings. He picked pairs and ice 
dancing based on if he thought they 
would make a good couple or not.
You know what they say, Jason 
said. The team that skates togeth
er...
Okay! I countered. Do you want 
to hear how I picked my NFL team?
Not being big on statistics, I 
picked players based on how much 
they smiled. I started with a snicker
ing Tony Romo and worked my way 
up to a beaming Larry Fitzgerald, 
who turned out to be a good choice 
because he eventually earned me 20 
,points in Round 1. Shonn Greene and 
Cedric Benson also made it on, along 
with their pearly whites. My team of 
Crest WhiteStrips models was ready 
to go.
A few weeks later, after the na
tional championships that served as 
Olympic trials for figure skating and 
the Round 1 Wild Card for football 
had ended, we met up to compare. 
My smiling football boys totaled up 
to 110 points, well above Jasons 97 
and Adams 67.1 was ecstatic.
For figure skating nationals, how
ever, I had typically over-analyzed 
and ended up in a dismal 333rd
place. Meanwhile, using his pieceby-piece strategy, Jason tied for 25th 
place.
Like a BAWSS! he declared.
At this point in my education, I 
was relieved to finally find out how 
the world really works. Having no 
knowledge can undeniably be your
Rachel Inman/Art Staff'
best strategy. Knowing this now, I 
threw in the towel and started ran
domly pointing at my computer 
screen for my Olympic picks. It might 
be my best bet.

Better planning required for winter storm responseMandates fail to teach healthy lifestyle
Hailing from the beautiful out
skirts of Cleveland, Ohio, Ive pretty 
much been raised to dislike and op
pose all things Pittsburgh. From the 
sports teams to the rivers that, as far 
as I know, have never been on fire 
(lame), there seems to be nothing 
in this wreck of a city that I can like. 
So when the recent blizzard-esque 
storm wreaked havoc around town 
this past week, I just knew something 
would come out of it that would have 
me despising the city of Pittsburgh 
more than ever.
Now, at this point in my time here 
at Carnegie Mellon, I have experi
enced Pittsburgh winters three times, 
and the first two were nothing I had 
not seen before. I did notice last year, 
however, that Pittsburgh seemed to 
care little about its immediate sub
urbs  you know, where many of 
its residents live  and maintaining 
safe driving and walking conditions 
in those areas. But for the most part 
it wasnt too bad, and I attributed 
some of the awful conditions near 
the road to college students who 
dont shovel the sidewalks in front of 
their houses on Beeler and in other 
residences near campus.
Then last week happened, and 
the crazy-meter shot through the 
roof with school being canceled, cars 
getting stuck in the middle of the 
road, and the hilarious antics of peo
ple attempting to get up the hill near 
Forbes and More wood. As someone 
who drives in Pittsburgh now, the 
conditions of late are worse than any 
I have experienced in my life. The 
main question I keep hearing asked
by myself and others is simply, What 
was the city thinking this whole 
time? It was clear that a storm was 
coming and double-digit inches of 
snow were expected. Yet the lack of 
plows around town was astonishing. 
I even talked to one of the half-dozen 
plow operators I saw who told me, 
Im not a professional; I really dont 
know what Im doing, just trying to 
get snow off the road. And while it 
is sometimes that simple, how is it 
that a city that routinely experiences 
snow for multiple months out of the 
year does not have a veritable fleet of 
plows, not to mention an organized 
plan for which locations are most im
portant to keep cleared?
And do not think for a second that 
Pittsburgh deserves less blame due 
to the magnitude of the snowfall, 
because exactly two years ago, on 
Feb. 16, 2008, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said in a press conference that 
he was disappointed in the snow re
moval job done by the city, vowed to 
inventory public works vehicles, and 
overall to do a better job of remov
ing snow and ice from the streets. 
And just look at that, a vow from a 
politician who had two full years to 
do anything he proposed at the time, 
including putting plows on garbage 
trucks and other city machinery, and 
yet failed at every single possible av
enue. Instead, the mayor spent his 
time trying to get a little extra dough 
from us students, who clearly are 
not pulling our weight in this city. I 
guess we should have shoveled our 
sidewalks more.

Childhood obesity is a problem.
The big question lies in how to 
solve this particular problem, which 
seems to be growing worst as time 
passes.
Some people, including the cur
rent administration, think the solu
tion is to remove all junk food from 
schools. According to a recent New 
York Times article, legislation will 
soon be introduced to do just that.
While a healthy diet is essential 
for preventing weight-related health 
problems, banning junk food is not 
the best way to solve this problem. 
Instead, the government should fo
cus on encouraging a healthy lifestyle 
through choices, not mandates.
Banning junk food in schools 
would force children to eat well dur
ing the school day, but theres noth
ing to stop them from eating what
ever they want at home, as long as 
its something their parents would 
allow. As in most matters concerning 
children, parents should have more 
control than the government. What 
a child eats or does not eat is some
thing for his or her parents to decide.
In addition, banning junk food 
would target the wrong age group. 
In elementary school, it is rare to find 
regular offerings of french fries and 
candy, whereas in high school it is 
common.
While it is important to encourage 
children of all ages to make healthy 
dietary choices, by the time students 
are in high school, they are probably 
already suffering as a result of a poor 
diet. Childhood obesity starts well be
fore high school, and as a result, the 
government should focus its efforts 
on teaching elementary school-aged 
students to live healthy lives.
Instead of instituting a ban on all 
things that are not nutritious, schools 
should teach students to make 
healthy choices. Schools are already 
required to offer health and physi
cal education classes throughout the 
course of a childs education. With 
reforms to these curricula, students 
will be more likely to lead healthy 
lifestyles not just inside school but 
also throughout their lives.
Physical education classes often 
revolve around learning the rules 
of sports, and at least in my school, 
there was very little exercise in
volved. If schools instead taught 
students exercises they could do in
dividually or sports like tennis where 
only one partner is needed, students 
would be more likely to exercise out-; 
side of class. The rules of basketball 
and football are interesting to some 
people, but for most students, theyll 
never be useful.
Health programs could also be re
formed to fit todays needs. Since the 
concern here is to try to stop child
hood obesity, health classes could 
be targeted toward that end. Rather 
than spending a great deal of time 
on communicable diseases and re
productive health, teachers could fo
cus on nutrition. From a young age, 
children can learn to make healthier 
choices if they understand why they 
should. By making healthy food ap
pealing and fun, which is entirely 
possible at the elementary school 
age, schools will encourage children 
to eat better without "forcing them to 
do so.
However, while these reforms 
would play a huge part in reducing 
or eliminating childhood obesity, 
unless parents step in and continue 
where the schools leave off, noth
ing will change. Parents are respon
sible for their children 100 percent 
of the time, including while they are 
at school. If parents choose to allow
their children to buy lunch, especial
ly in elementary school, it allows the 
children to make their own decisions 
about what to eat before they are 
fully aware of how to make healthy 
choices.
Instead of buying lunch, parents 
should pack lunches when they can, 
making sure to include items from 
each food group. By showing their 
children that they not only care 
about what they eat, but also that 
they want them to eat healthy foods, 
parents can aid their children in mak
ing smarter choices. In addition, par
ents have more control over how the 
food is presented, and if presented in 
a fun way (for example, celery sticks 
filled with peanut butter and raisins), 
healthy food choices can be just as 
appealing as unhealthy ones.
Parents responsibilities dont end 
with lunch, though. Healthy, homecooked meals eaten together will also 
encourage children to eat well. By 
showing the child that food  good 
food  is a priority, he or she will see 
that food choices are important.
Ending the reliance on prepared 
foods and takeout will benefit chil
dren and help to reduce the likeli
hood of childhood obesity.
If parents and schools work to
gether to improve the health of chil
dren and encourage a healthy life
style, including both a nutritious diet 
and regular exercise, children will be 
less likely to have weight problems 
and more likely to have better self
esteem.
A government ban on junk food in 
schools would not be as effective and 
should be avoided in favor of a plan 
that focuses instead on teaching chil
dren to make healthy choices.

ers in their whole lineup, so 
we were happy with a win, 
senior Jon Spero observed. 
We came out flat in doubles, 
which [assistant coach] Mike 
wasnt happy with, but we 
raised our level when things 
got tight.
The Tartans continued 
their momentum into the 
singles portion of the dual 
match, taking four of the 
six singles. MacTaggart and 
Nemerov dropped both their 
singles, but to very good op
ponents.
Muliawan defeated his op
ponent in a battle 7-5, 6-4, 
after being down 2-5 in the 
first, while Spero outlasted 
his opponent 6-4, 6-4. Firstyear Harsha Rao also had a 
tough match, pulling out the 
first set 7-6 (1) but easily tak
ing the second 6-2. Miller 
breezed through his match 
at number four singles, drop
ping only three games to 
win 6-2, 6-1. We know our 
strength is the bottom of the 
lineup, and this showed, as 
we won [third through sixth] 
singles and doubles, Spero 
said. We really needed this 
win to get us ready for In
doors. We have high expecta
tions for ourselves. ;

TENNIS, from A12
This team was very 
tough, Herrick said. Im 
glad we came away with this 
win. The snow caused a lot 
of chaos with our practice 
schedule, so I was worried 
we were going into the match 
unprepared. I think this win 
against a D-II team definitely 
prepares us for nationals in a 
few weeks.
Chen shared her partners 
sentiments. This was a good 
match for us to start our sea
son with. Match play gives us 
a level of intensity that some
times cant be replicated in 
practice.
Slippery Rock senior Lau
ra Handy gave Chen a run for 
her money at first singles, but 
Chen eventually came out on 
top, 6-7 (4), 6-1,10-6. Chin 
followed that up by defeating 
The Rocks Sarah Lynch 6-3,
7-5. Tapak battled opponent 
Dunja Drmac and eventu
ally came out with the hardearned win, 7-6 (1), 7-6 (3). 
I was disappointed that I
wasnt able to play as well as 
I hoped, Tapak said in ref

But after a couple of months 
without any matches, this 
was a very good way to kick

Weve been working very

Track and field teams compete 
well at Bucknells Winter Classic
ALLYSON KOYEN
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens track and field 
teams traveled to Lewisburg, 
Pa. on Saturday to compete in 
Bucknell Universitys annual 
Winter Classic. Despite stiff 
competition with many strong 
track and field programs par
ticipating, such as Division I 
teams including St. Francis 
University and Seton Hall, the 
Tartans challenged their op
ponents and achieved impres
sive results.
For the women, many in
dividual performances were 
noteworthy. Sophomore Luci 
Laffitte won the long jump, 
clearing a distance of 4.95 
meters. Laffitte also placed 
13th in the 60-meter hurdles 
with a time of 9.77 seconds 
and tied for third place in the 
high jump, clearing a height 
of 1.55 meters. In the high 
jump, Laffitte was followed 
closely by senior Jessica Wil
liams, who cleared a height 
of 1.50 meters, putting her in 
12th place.
The women also fared 
well in the distance events.
First-year Emily Wobb placed 
12th in the 3000-meter run 
with a time of 10:46.59. In 
the 800-meter run, junior 
Courtney Baker placed third, 
followed by senior Diane Mat
tingly in seventh, with times 
of 2:21.27 and 2:25.33, re
spectively.
On the mens side, the re
sults were equally strong. For 
the field events, senior James 
Hulley took second in the shot 
put, throwing 16.15 meters, 
a season best, provisionally 
qualifying him again for the 
NCAA Indoor National Cham
pionship.
Hulley initially qualified 
two weeks prior when he 
threw 16.12 meters, but Sat
urdays throw puts him that 
much closer to going to na
tionals.
Hulley also placed 12th in 
the weight throw, throwing a 
distance of 14.31 meters. Ju
nior Pat OBrien placed ninth 
in the triple jump, clearing 
13.18 meters.
Junior Nate Bussiere led 
the way for the Tartans in the 
mile, as he took seventh with 
a time of 4:22.36. Sophomore 
Rob Morhard wasnt far behind in ninth place with his 
4:23.52 run.
Junior J.P. Allera placed 
fourth in the mens 5000-meter run in 15:35.19, and ju
nior Justin Kurp was the track 
teams highest individual fin
isher when he placed third 
in the 1000-meter run with a 
time of 2:36.74. The
The sprinters also finished 
strong, as junior Dustin Musselmans 51.28 time in the 
400-meter dash was good 
enough for eighth. First-year 
Ben Nealy took ninth in the 
mens 500-meter dash in 
1:09.79, and fellow first-year 
Daniel Ching placed 13th 
with his 8.93 run in the mens 
60-meter hurdles.
The mens 4x100 relay 
consisting of Bussiere, Musselman, OBrien, and firstyear John Caverhill placed 
sixth overall with a time of 
3:28.99.
The Tartans will travel to 
Alliance, Ohio on Saturday to 
compete against Mount Union 
College. The Tartans have 
two more meets left before 
they head to St. Louis, Mo. to 
compete in the UAA Outdoor 
Championships.

break, the Yellowjackets held 
a 33-31 lead over the Tartans. 
A three-pointer by Anderson 
kicked off the second half and 
gave the Tartans the boost 
they needed to come away 
with the victory. With 15:47 
to go in the half, the Yellow
jackets took a 42-40 lead, but 
it was the last lead they would 
have for the rest of the game. 
The Tartans pulled away from 
Rochester, shooting 47.8 per
cent from the field and 72.7 
percent from the line.
Anderson once again led 
the Tartans with 16 points 
,followed by Rife with 14 and 
sophomore John Duhring 
with 13.
It was great to finally 
break this streak and win our 
first UAA game, Anderson 
said. Weve put a lot of work 
into this season and its about 
time that we execute.
The Tartans are back in

Mens basketball loses 71-77
CASEY GARTH
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
mens basketball team was fi
nally able to break a 14-game 
losing streak and take home 
their first University Athletic 
Association (UAA) victory. 
This weekend the Tartans 
hosted UAA opponents Emory 
University and the University 
of Rochester.
On Friday night, the Tar
tans took on the Emory Ea
gles, but fell 71-77 in the final 
minutes. With numerous lead 
changes in the first half, the 
teams battled for control of 
the game. The Eagles came 
out to a strong start, leading 
the Tartans 13-8 four min
utes into the half, but the next 
four minutes belonged to the 
Tartans as they scored 11 un
answered points. With 9:08 
remaining in the half, Carn
egie Mellon took a 26-18 lead 
with junior Shane Rife scor
ing 10 of the 18 points. The 
Tartans lead did not last for 
long as Emory took control,
outscoring the Tartans 24-8 
during the last nine minutes 
to take a 42-34 lead heading 
into the half.
The Tartans came out of 
the break fired up, going on 
a 16-4 run to get within one 
point of the Eagles. The 53- 
52 score was as close as the 
Tartans would come as Emo
ry slowly began to pull away. 
Back-to-back three-pointers 
for the Eagles kicked off their 
run as they went on to end the 
game 71-77.
Senior Jack Anderson led 
the Tartans offense to score 
21 points, followed by Rife 
and junior Matt Pettit, who 
added 17 and 16 points, re
spectively. Pettit recorded his 
seventh double-double of the 
season, pulling in a gamehigh 11 rebounds.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
pulled out their first UAA vic
tory defeating Rochester 73- 
64. The first half was a battle 
for the upper hand as neither 
team took more than a fourpoint lead during the first 20 
minutes of play. Going into the

back due to the recent bliz
zard, the Carnegie Mellon 
mens tennis team hit the 
ground running in its first

II West Virginia Wesleyan Col
lege, wiping out the Bobcats 
7-2. The Tartans moved to 
4-1 overall with this win and 
are gearing up for the ITA In
door National Championships 
this weekend.
The Tartans quickly took 
the lead against the Bobcats, 
going up 3-0 after a sweep 
from the doubles teams. The 
ITA doubles champions, the 
duo of seniors James Muliawan and Niko Ljuboja, 
added a point to the total at 
first doubles. Initially down 
3-6, they rallied back to nar
rowly win 9-8 (7). The young 
team of first-year Duke Miller 
and sophomore Jeremy King 
knocked out their opponents 
8-6 to take the second point. 
Completing the sweep at third
doubles were juniors Alex 
Nemerov and Bobby MacTaggart, also winning 8-6.
Niko and I had quite a 
scare in our doubles, Muliawan said, but since weve 
played together so much we 
were able to pull it out at the 
end. Indoors is coming up in 
a week, with very difficult 
teams, so this was a good war

On Friday, Emory hit the 
first two baskets of the game 
to take a five-point lead, but 
Carnegie Mellon answered

the lead at halftime, 27-26. 
First-year guard Brit Phillips 
clinched the Tartans first-half 
lead with two free throws.
Fifth-year senior forward 
Rachelle Roll opened the 
second half with a layup, but 
the rest of the Tartan offense 
could not match Emorys, as 
the Eagles went on a'7-13
run. Emory held the lead un
til there were four minutes 
left in the game, when sopho
more guard Alison Aunkst hit 
two free throws to help Carne
gie Mellon take back the lead, 
47-46. But Emory would not 
back down and went on a 7-3

with 44 seconds left. Sopho
more forward Jennifer Lar

Tartans within two points, 
and Phillips shot a buzzerbeater to put the game into 
extra minutes.
Emory hit the first basket

While the snowstorm 
loomed in the forecast, the 
mens and womens swim
ming and diving teams 
continued to work hard in
doors in the pool, with the 
end of their regular season 
quickly approaching. Re
cently, first-year Brandon 
Yee was named the Univer
sity Athletic Associations 
(UAA) Mens Swimming 
Athlete of the Week after 
a notable performance in 
the meet against Denison 
University.
Yee placed first in the 
500-yard freestyle and 
second in the 200-yard 
freestyle in what was a 
close loss to the Big Red. 
Although he is only in the 
first year of his college ca
reer, Yee is already making 
a name for himself in the 
realm of Tartan athletics.
Hailing from sunny 
Danville, Calif., Yee cites 
Pittsburghs ever-changing 
weather as something that 
keeps him on his toes and 
adds to his college expe
rience away from home. 
Yee affirms his decision to 
attend Carnegie Mellon 
on the basis of prestigious 
academics and successful
athletics programs. Major
ing in information systems, 
Yee hopes to pursue gradu
ate school and a career in 
information securities in 
the future.
Yee was named MVP 
three out of his four years 
on his high school swim 
team, and his dedication 
and talent seem to have 
carried over to his efforts 
here at Carnegie Mellon. 
With sights set on a con

Living off campus: Pros and cons of life 
outside of Carnegie Mellon housing choicesAn argument for staying on campus
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Contributing Editor
For those tired of dorm 
life, moving off campus is an 
extremely enticing option. 
While there are a few down
sides to the decision, there are 
a number of benefits as well.
Listed below are some pros 
and cons of living off campus. 
You can use this as a guide to 
whether moving off campus is 
the right decision for you.
Pros
1. Its cheaper than on-campus housing.
Although this is not true 
in all cases (if you choose to 
live alone in a beautiful studio 
apartment in the middle of up
scale Walnut Street, its going 
to be way more expensive), in 
most cases, especially if you 
are sharing an apartment with 
a roommate, the cost will be 
quite affordable.
Rent for two-bedroom 
apartments usually ranges 
from around $600 to $800 per 
month. Adding to that an elec
tricity bill of around $100 per 
month during the winter, and 
an Internet bill of around $50 
per month, the total expen
diture per month is usually 
around $750 to $950. Split 
that between two people and 
you have to pay $375 to $475 
per month.
If you do the math, you will 
realize that for four months in 
an off-campus apartment you 
have to pay a maximum of
$1900. Meanwhile, a prime 
double in Morewood costs 
$3170 per semester. If you 
choose apartment-style living 
offered by the university, it 
will be even more expensive. 
In terms of cost, we can see 
that living off campus is the 
clear winner.
2. You have a kitchen to 
yourself
If you were one of those 
people who hated it when you 
had to walk all the way across 
the dorm carrying utensils 
and food to cook, only to real
ize that the kitchen was occu
pied, off-campus living is for 
you. With your own kitchen 
you can spend hours cooking, 
clean up at your leisure, and 
not have to worry about what 
that suspicious-looking spill 
on the stove was.
3. Theres more space.
This is an obvious one. You 
can have your own bedroom. 
Theres a living room that you 
dont have to share with the 
20 people living on your floor. 
You have more closet space. 
It is also great for parties  
when you invite 10 people 
over, they actually have space 
to move around.
4. Its closer to good food.
If you are bored of cooking 
and are looking for options to 
eat out, you have a wide range 
of choices available once you 
live off campus. Apartments
in Oakland and around Craig 
Street are near some excellent 
restaurants. Ranging from In
dian to Italian to Mexican cui
sines, you have it all. Shadyside and Squirrel Hill also 
have a number of options for 
eating out.
5. You dont need to worry 
about noise levels.
You dont have to worry 
about loud music playing at 2 
a.m. when you have an exam 
the next day.
Conversely, you dont have 
to worry about disturbing 
others when you want to play 
loud music at night. Apart
ments arent soundproof, 
but they are reasonably well 
spaced apart so that you are 
not disturbed by what is going 
on in your neighbors house 
and vice-versa.
Cons/
1. Its far from campus.
This is perhaps the most 
widely expressed argument 
against living off campus. Al
though this is a problem, it 
depends on where you live. 
Oakland and Craig Street 
are not too bad a walk from 
campus, and once you start 
living there, you will find a 
number of shortcuts. Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, on the 
other hand, do pose a prob
lem and are quite a distance 
from campus, though buses 
do run through these neigh
borhoods.
2. You are away from 
friends.
Unless all of your close 
friends decide to move off 
campus, you will be away 
from people on whose doors 
you could have knocked at 
crazy hours of the night.
3. You have much heavier 
backpacks.
There is no way you can 
run back and forth between 
your apartment and campus 
multiple times throughout 
the day. You end up having to 
carry your laptop and all the 
books you want to study from. 
This does result in frequent 
backaches throughout the se
mester.
Ultimately, if you really 
want to move off campus, 
there are ways to make it 
work.
The university Escort 
shuttle is quite reliable. If 
you are someone who will 
miss friends, study with them 
during the day or have them 
come and stay over with you. 
As for the heavier bags, con
sider using library resources 
sometimes instead of carrying 
everything with you.
While living off campus 
may have downsides, there 
are certainly ways around 
them.
Living off campus can be 
a great experience, and there 
are many benefits which can 
make the experience very 
worthwhile in the end.

We all come to college 
ready for a taste of indepen
dence. And were granted just 
that upon arrival on our first 
day at Carnegie Mellon, even 
if that independence comes 
with close living quarters 
with a roommate  or room
mates  that youve never 
met before, and being sub
jected to the same selection of 
food day in and day out with 
the mandatory meal plan. So 
its no wonder that after a 
year of this monotony, many 
students are ready to move 
off campus, to gain real in
dependence after being ba
bied in the first-year dorms. 
Im here to tell you, however, 
that staying on campus isnt 
all that bad.
After about the first 
month of classes, the novelty 
of waking up every day at 8 
a.m. quickly wears off, espe
cially with the often-dreary 
Pittsburgh weather. Knowing 
this, it is much easier to force 
yourself to get up for class 
when you only have a fiveminute walk ahead of you, 
rather than a 25-minute one. 
Living on campus allows you 
the benefit of extra pushes of 
the snooze button, something 
that all students appreciate.
And when youre finally 
finished cramming for that 
big exam at 2 a.m. and leaving 
the library, its certainly com
forting to know that your bed 
is mere minutes away, and 
that you dont have to walk to
your apartment quickly while 
holding your valuables close 
and keeping an eye out for 
approaching shadows.
Living on campus also 
gives you a place to stop back 
during the day when you have 
a few hours between classes
 you dont have to be a per
manent fixture in the napping 
pod in the library or the black 
chairs in the UC when you 
need a quick nap. Likewise, 
you dont have to carry every 
single book and notebook 
with you for your entire days 
schedule. It also gives you 
and your friends somewhere 
to come back to when you 
need a break from homework 
or studying, but arent will
ing to go anywhere far. Plus, 
theres a good chance that 
the television stations offered 
by Carnegie Mellon are more 
varied than those of your offcampus friends.
Finally, it gives you a 
chance to always be near to 
anything thats happening on 
campus, whether its a lastminute snowball fight, a spurof-the-moment decision by 
your floor to go to half-price 
in Oakland, or a melon hunt 
inspired by Ellen DeGeneres 
(true story).
While you may not have 
real independence like 
your peers dwelling off cam
pus, theres time for that af
ter college, when real life 
begins. Until then, take ad
vantage of the snooze button 
and weekly bathroom clean
ing that comes with living on 
campus.
Personality profiles of neighborhoods surrounding Carnegie Mellon
SABRINA PORTER
Contributing Editor
Oakland
Just a 10- to 15-minute 
walk (or five-minute bus ride) 
from campus lies the begin
ning of Oakland, the home of 
late-night food, University of 
Pittsburgh pride, and a popu
lation made up almost entirely 
of college students.
Oakland is home to some 
of Carnegie Mellon students 
favorite restaurants, including 
The O, Chipotle, Chick-FilA, Fuel and Fuddle, and Mad 
Mex. The food is what this 
neighborhood is known for on 
our campus.
For those over 21, Oakland 
has a good group of late-night 
destinations, such as local 
bars like Hemingways and 
Mad Mex (and its classic halfprice margaritas), all of which 
are filled with numerous likeminded students. There is also 
an extensive liquor store in 
walking distance.
Another benefit of Oakland 
is its availability of afford
able houses close to campus. 
Oakland Avenue and Atwood 
Avenue are lined with student 
housing for both Carnegie 
Mellon and University of Pitts
burgh students.
Most people living here are 
always up for fun, and if youre 
looking for a quiet neighbor
hood, Oakland may not be it. 
Starting on Thursday nights
 the start of the weekend 
for University of Pittsburgh 
students  the neighborhood 
awakens, filled with groups of 
college kids out to have a good 
time.
Oakland should be noted 
for its fun atmosphere and is 
ideal for anyone looking for 
an extended weekend as well 
as very college-oriented sur
roundings.
Shadyside
Shadyside is home to up
perclassmen from Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh, graduate students, 
and young working profes
sionals. It is accessible by 
Pittsburgh buses. It tends to 
be slightly pricier than Oak
land or Squirrel Hill; however, 
it is the most charming of the 
areas surrounding campus, 
with its tree-lined streets and 
boutiques. The neighborhood 
is most well-known for two of 
its assets: shopping and popu
lar bars. Walnut Street is lined 
with a wide variety of shops  
from small boutiques to Apple, 
J. Crew, Ann Taylor, and Ba
nana Republic. Cozy restau
rants such as Walnut Grill are 
dispersed in between.
Just blocks from the res
taurants are Shadysides bars. 
William Penn Tavern and 
Shady Grove are the most
popular, known by students 
to be the closest bar locations 
outside of Panther Hollow Inn. 
William Penn Tavern in partic
ular gathers a large number of 
Carnegie Mellon students. On 
Tuesdays and Sundays, Wil
liam Penn Tavern is open to all 
ages for its wing nights when 
one can get 10 wings in a vari
ety of flavors, from traditional 
BBQ to the flavor mix of the 
kitchen sink, for $3.
While the area of Shady
side near these bars can be 
loud from Thursday to Sunday, 
Shadyside in general is a very 
quiet area. The young profes
sionals that live in the area 
are sometime? called yuppies, 
and the college students who 
live there are of a wide vari
ety, from artists and technical 
majors to medical students. 
Shadyside is a great area for 
anyone looking for either a 
quiet escape from campus or a 
bustling experience.
Squirrel Hill
Just up the big hill on Forbes
 Avenue is the start of Squir
rel Hill. It is either a 20-min
ute walk or a three-minute 
bus ride from campus, and 
the buses are very frequent, 
with all of the 61s serving the 
route. The neighborhood is 
the most residential of all the 
areas surrounding campus, as 
in addition to upper-level stu
dents from Carnegie Mellon, 
it is also home to faculty and 
Pittsburgh families not associ
ated with the university. The 
pricing of the area is an in
termediary between Oakland 
and Shadyside. Most Carn
egie Mellon students know the 
neighborhood for its restau
rants and its truly giant Giant 
Eagle. Squirrel Hill has vastly 
diverse restaurants from Thai 
food at Silk Elephant to Medi
terranean food at Mediterra
nean Grill to the well-known
Gulliftys. The restaurants 
are dispersed between small 
shops including those on the 
main thoroughfare, Forbes Av
enue, such as Littles Shoes, a 
novelty card shop, and a cheap 
video shop.
On Murray Avenue, just off 
Forbes Avenue, the Giant Eagle 
is the perfect one-stop-shop 
for all your food necessities. 
Squirrel Hill is relatively quiet, 
with most noise coming from 
traffic on Forbes and Murray 
Avenues. It is not a college 
neighborhood like Oakland or 
Shadyside and does not have 
a prominent bar scene. It does 
have a certain functionality 
and residential atmosphere, 
however, that the other two 
areas lack.
For someone looking for a 
short ride or walk from cam
pus with all the necessities in 
walking distance and a wide 
variety of cuisines, Squirrel 
Hill may be the place.
Room Selection: A step-by-step guide to each phase of the process
J. ELIOT DEGOLIA
Copy Staff
Students who have par
ticipated in Room Selection in 
the past may remember Hous
ing Services major changes 
to the process last year. This 
year, there are no noticeable 
changes in the Room Selection 
process. Everything  apart 
from slightly different dates  
is the same. But for those stu
dents still unsure of the pro
cess, here is a rundown of the 
phases of Room Selection.
Room Selection
The Room Selection pro
cess is broken down into sev
eral phases: Room Retention, 
Pull-ins, Elect to Participate, 
and the General Room Selec
tion. Room Selection occurs 
during the next five weeks of 
classes, so all students who 
will be returning next year 
should at least start thinking 
about their plans.
Room Retention
Room Retention, the first 
phase, which begins today at
9 a.m., gives students the op
tion to remain in their current 
living location as long as they 
are currently part of a build
ing or floor that allows room 
retention. If you live in an ex
clusively first-year building or 
floor, you are unable to retain 
your room. This retention pro
cess ends at 5 p.m. on Feb. 26.
Pull-ins
The following week, start
ing at 9 a.m. on March 1, is 
the Pull-ins phase. Each day 
is designated to certain build
ings for retainers to choose 
their pull-ins; Monday is for 
students in Resnik and West 
Wing; Tuesday for Morewood, Henderson, McGill, and 
Welch; Wednesday for Do
herty, Roselawn, Woodlawn, 
and Margaret Morrison apart
ments; and Thursday for Fair
fax, Shady Oak, and Webster. 
Friday of that week is the day 
for any makeups.
Elect to Participate
Following spring break will 
be the Elect to Participate 
phase. Like last year, this is 
optional but necessary for 
all students intending to re
main in campus housing who 
havent retained, been pulled 
in, or applied for Block Hous
ing. This process begins March
14 at 9 a.m. and continues un
til March 18 at 5 p.m. Lottery 
numbers for General Room 
Selection will be sent out the 
following day, March 19, by 5 
p.m.
The Elect to Participate 
phase is the period for Oak
land Priority and Block Hous
ing Selection. Oakland Priority 
Selection is for students who 
are being displaced from their 
Oakland apartments. Block 
Housing is for any groups of 
six or more students planning 
on living in the same building. 
Areas designated for Block 
Housing are Fairfax, Shady 
Oak, and Webster. All Block
Housing placements must 
completely fill their rooms  
no empty slots are allowed. 
Oakland Priority Selection is 
March 15, and Block Housing 
Selection is March 16 and 17. 
Applications for Block Hous
ing are due March 5 by 5 p.m.
General Room Selection
The final phase is General 
Room Selection. All students
who elected to participate 
are scheduled to choose their 
room according to their lot
tery numbers. The selection 
process will take place March 
22-25. Open assignments will 
take place on the last day of 
the General Room Selection.
All individuals participat
ing must choose from either 
a single room, or a room or 
apartment which has only one 
space left. Housing rates are
File Photo
expected to increase again this 
year by about 6 to 7 percent. 
In addition, the housing res
ervation fee will increase from 
$300 to $400, which is includ
ed in the rate increase.
There will be no newly 
added first-year-only housing 
facilities this year.

Resnik and West Wing are 
the ideal dormitory choices 
for students who arent ready
 or arent willing  to move 
off campus, but want a bit 
more of a grown-up place 
to live than a typical dorm. 
While students in these dorms 
have the chance to be more 
independent, they also boast 
a quick five-minute walk to 
any of the academic buildings 
on campus, a definite benefit 
for those mornings when you 
just cant seem to stop hitting 
the snooze button.
Both dorms consist pri
marily of suites, which are 
made up of two doubles and 
a single, with a common bath
room and lounge for the suite. 
A limited number of prime 
singles and doubles do exist in 
the buildings as well, though 
they are not as well known.
Resnik and West Wing are 
optimal for a group of friends 
who wish to live together, but 
want to maintain their prox
imity to campus and the other 
advantages  like free toi
let paper and a once-a-week 
bathroom cleaning  that liv
ing on campus offers.
Students mostly stay in
side their suites, leaving the 
hallways relatively quiet. 
The lounges do fill up, how
ever  usually with groups 
of students either working 
on homework or hooking up 
their video game systems to 
the television.
Both buildings do offer 
kitchens on certain floors, 
which is nice when youve 
had your fill of Gingers and 
S Seor.
If you dont feel like cook
ing, Resnik is home to a num
ber of dining options. There 
is the Tartans Pavilion, Car
negie Mellon Caf (with its 
newly expanded menu), and 
a new dining area that offers 
a variety of choices, includ
ing sushi, Indian cuisine, and 
comfort foods, among others.
With the numerous ame
nities that Resnik and West 
Wing offer, it is not surprising 
that both of these dorms fill 
up early in the room selection 
process. Hopeful residents are 
advised to find a friend who 
can pull them in.

Doherty offers close apartments
Location: On the corner of Forbes Avenue and Beeler Street, on top of a hill looking across from 
the East Campus parking garage.
Style(s) of Housing: Apartments  one-bedroom triple (three students); efficiencies  onebedroom doubles (two students); a two-bedroom suite (five students) for special-interest hous
ing
Size: 149 residents
Kitchens: In each apartment and efficiency 
Lounges: Study lounge, TV lounge
Other Amenities: Lounges include piano, pool table, ping pong table; laundry facilities include 
six washers and six dryers; exercise facilities include four cardio machines and dumbbells. Stor
age facilities are provided for every tower. An outdoor basketball hoop and picnic bench areas
are provided.
WILLIAM MUELLER
Junior Staffwriter
Doherty Apartments is 
considered one of the best 
options for on-campus hous
ing and is deceptively close 
to campus facilities. It is a 
mere three-minute walk to 
the Resnik Caf and a brisk
10 minutes from most classes. 
Doherty is also one of the best 
options for students who wish 
to have their own kitchen in 
an autonomous apartmentesque style of living.
Doherty is divided into four 
separate towers, each headed 
by its own RA, who provides 
residents with the bare essen
tials: trash bags, paper towels, 
and, of course, toilet paper. 
Each tower consists of three 
floors and a basement. Often 
the smell of one of your neigh
bors cooking will infiltrate the 
hallway and your room just 
pray it isnt cabbage casse
role.
As a community, there are 
weekly events to satisfy ones
sweet tooth and exercise pro
grams to sweat off the fol
lowing days regret. However, 
due primarily to the tower 
layout of the building, mak
ing friends in Doherty will 
make you long for the days 
of freshman year. Most doors 
remain closed throughout the 
day, and the occasional meet 
and awkwardly greet as you 
leave the building with your 
neighbors permeates the 
school year.
During the fal,l and spring 
time, Dohertys mountainous 
landscape is lush and ideal 
for picnickers and bees. The 
building provides an outdoor 
basketball hoop and several 
benches to take advantage of 
Pittsburghs pleasant weath
er. Doherty also provides a 
parking lot for faculty that is 
open for students past 5 p.m. 
on weekdays and all day dur
ing the weekend.
Doherty provides air-con
ditioning in its exercise room; 
however, that is the only room 
in Doherty that does so. Most
residents purchase personal 
air-conditioning units fpr use 
during the hot times. Make 
sure to take them out during 
the winter, as Dohertys heat
ers are seemingly weak, and 
you need to be able to capture 
every fleeting bit of warmth 
you can.
Dohertys rooms provide 
just the right mix of isolation 
and integration with your 
roommates. The one-bedroom 
triples include a bedroom for 
the three beds, a bathroom, 
and a living room with the 
kitchenette equipped. The liv
ing room also has three study 
desks, a dining table, a fash
ionable couch, and a small 
loveseat.
The two-person efficien
cies are similar, though ev
erything is located in a single 
room without some of the fur
niture.
In general, Doherty Apart
ments provide a decently 
sized living area for those that 
seek autonomy their in col
lege lives.
Morewood has social living space

For students who are social 
or who like to have it all with
out ever leaving the comfort 
of the building, Morewood 
Gardens is the perfect place 
to live. Located right across 
the street from the heart of 
campus, its al&o great for any
one who likes to sleep a little 
longer before running off to 
class.
Morewood is the home 
of the Underground, which 
is a huge benefit in the win
ter. While the food is just ac
ceptable in quality  and 
also in price  the ability to 
grab a meal without trudging 
through snow or facing the 
wind is useful. Even for stu
dents without a meal plan, the 
Underground sells drinks and 
ice cream, and who doesnt 
want easier access to those?
Besides having a food 
source in the basement, More
wood also houses a cluster, 
which is a great place to work 
if you dont have your own 
computer or if you find your
self becoming too distracted 
on your own computer. The 
printer is also great to have, 
and lines are often shorter 
than in other clusters on cam
pus.
Morewoods plentiful 
lounges, including a few on 
each floor in addition to the 
larger study rooms and TV 
lounge on the first floor, allow 
for frequent group gatherings. 
While this is a positive attri
bute for more social students, 
it means that several rooms 
on each floor are likely to ex
perience more frequent noise 
disturbances throughout the 
day and night.
When choosing a room in 
Morewood, its hit or miss. 
Some rooms are spacious and 
quiet, and others are small 
and loud. Its the luck of the 
draw, and sometimes you
lose. Try to plan out which 
rooms look best from the floor 
plans online, and try to visit 
the room before committing. 
This will give you a good idea 
of what youre getting.
Because there are so many 
rooms in the building, though, 
its a great place to live if 
you want to be near friends. 
Groups of students can get 
rooms near each other  or if 
not close physically, at least in 
the same building.
Residents are also more 
likely to see people they know 
often in Morewood, whether 
because these people live in 
the building or because they 
use the cluster or the Under
ground.
Morewood Gardens could 
be a great place to live, but 
before deciding to move in, 
check out the rooms ahead of 
time and ask the current resi
dents about the noise situa
tion, as some rooms are better 
than others.
McGill has female-only housing

Style(s) of Housing: Prime singl 
Size: 71 students

McGill, Carnegie Mellons 
only all-female dorm, offers 
residents prime doubles and 
singles arranged into suites. 
Each suite connects two 
doubles, or two doubles and 
one single. Rooms in McGill 
are small, meaning residents 
often are forced to Toft their 
beds and sleep only inches 
from the ceiling. However, the 
size of the rooms is offset by 
the convenience of semi-private bathrooms in each suite.
McGill may be all female, 
but residents social lives are 
certainly not limited. McGill 
offers a friendly environment, 
especially since residents can 
socialize in any of the indi
vidual floor lounges, or in 
the large first-floor television
or doubles
; main lounge on the first floor 
rec room
room and study area. Weekly 
events that bring together 
residents from both Boss and 
McGill offer a reliable dose of 
fun and entertainment. And, 
when residents tire of their 
own building, they are just a 
few steps away from other hill 
residences  including Ham
erschlag, Carnegie Mellons 
all-male dorm.
McGills location on Marga
ret Morrison Street also offers 
unique perks. Residents can 
catch art exhibitions, shows, 
and events at The Frame, 
Carnegie Mellons studentrun art gallery on the corner 
of Forbes and Margaret Mor
rison, which is just down the 
street from the dorm.
After a short walk across 
the street, residents can take 
advantage of the nearby cam
pus dining locations, includthat offers a study lounge and
ing Tartan Pavilion, CMU 
Caf, and Resnik Caf. And 
when campus food gets too 
monotonous, the food trucks 
parked nearby offer a great 
alternative to on-campus din
ing.
McGill certainly has its 
downfalls. Shared bathrooms 
with limited hot water, unre
liable locks, and tiny showers 
are certainly a concern  but 
dont forget to take into ac
count that the bathrooms, 
while slightly dysfunctional, 
are cleaned weekly by house
keeping staff. As for the 
rooms, size ranks at the top of 
the list of complaints.
However, despite the 
less-than-fabulous facilities, 
McGill offers female students 
an excellent social experience 
in a uniquely convenient loca
tion.File Photo

Woodlawn Apartments 
may be one of the older hous
ing options on campus, but 
it is convenient for walking 
to class, and its right on the 
Forbes Avenue bus routes that 
can take you anywhere else 
that youd like to go.
The bedrooms and living 
rooms boast plenty of space, 
an upgrade for those used to
cramped quarters. In addi
tion, the furniture has been re
cently updated, as have some 
of the kitchen appliances and 
bathroom fixtures.
This year, there have been 
repeated plumbing prob
lems, but maintenance has 
been quick to fix them. Sev
eral times per semester, The 
Frame art gallery, which is 
housed in the lower level of 
the apartment building, has 
loud parties that can be heard
throughout the building.
Woodlawn is great if you 
want to live with a big group 
of friends, since each apartment houses a lot of people. 
People generally keep to 
themselves, but there are rel
atively few residents, so youll 
get to know many of the oth
ers that live there. Woodlawn 
is a good choice if you want 
a small community and are 
looking for apartment living

As one of the more recently 
renovated student dorms on 
campus, Henderson House is 
a clean and quiet place to live. 
This dorm offers students 
air conditioning and heat
ing, connected bathrooms
 which are cleaned once a 
week  shared with one oth
er room, and the intimacy of a 
small building, with 20 rooms 
per floor. The first floor is gen
erally reserved for first-years 
only. There is also an eleva
tor, which, although slow and 
noisy, makes life significantly 
easier in the long run.
Henderson House is also 
one of the Wellness Houses, 
which promote green practic
es, maintaining a substancefree lifestyle, and overall 
general healthy living. Each 
student who lives here is ex
pected to sign an agreement 
promising to adhere to these
standards during the school 
year. Students can also take 
.advantage of playing for the 
houses IM teams or par
ticipating in weekly optional 
community activities set up by 
the resident assistants. Tick
ets to special events like plays 
or sho\s are subsidized by the 
dorm, which is a nice perk. 
Henderson, although placed 
on the outskirts of Carnegie 
Mellon, is sheltered from any 
traffic or noise from campus. 
The dorms residents also re
spect an unwritten policy of 
peace and quiet, which makes 
this dorm ideal for studying. 
Despite being on a hill, Hen
derson is very close to Tepper, the tennis courts, Gesling 
Stadium, and the eateries at 
Resnik, such as Carnegie Mel
lon Caf and Taste of India.
There are several advan
tages to living in a small dorm; 
students can often find most 
of the amenities always avail
able for use. The first floor
contains a ping pong/pool, 
table, a piano, and a spacious 
lounge with a TV and several 
board games. One of the bet
ter perks is the workout room 
with several machines, a TV, 
and floor-to-ceiling mirrors. 
There is also a study room, 
a laundry room, and a full 
kitchen equipped with sup
plies.
Despite all Henderson has 
to offer students, there are' 
drawbacks. Dorm rooms are 
not the largest of rooms, and  
on occasion the heating wiilmalfunction, turning each 
room into a furnace. If one is 
looking for a dorm to social-' 
ize and hang out in, it will 
be more difficult since there 
is only one community spacfefor the whole building, and 
only narrow hallways for the 
remaining floors. 
While Henderson may not 
be the biggest of dorms, it is a 
quiet, clean, and convenient 
place to live for any student.'

Margaret Morrison Apart
ments, located up on the 
Hill, offers residents arguably 
the nicest on-campus apart
ments.
Each unit has two floors, 
with a lounge and kitchen on 
the first floor and bedrooms 
and bathrooms either up or 
down a floor, depending on 
the apartment.
All of the Maggie Mo 
apartments were redone in 
2d07, when they were refitted 
with newer furniture, appli
ances, and counter tops. This 
refnodeling of the apartments 
gites Margaret Morrsion an 
edge over the other on-cam
pus apartment choices.
Although these apart
ments technically have a com
mon lounge or living area on 
the first floor, these arent spa
cious by any means. This can 
be a deterent for those resi
dents who may look forward 
to holding parties in their 
new pad  there simply isnt 
space for anything more than 
a small dinner party.
The bedrooms, however, 
are exactly the opposite, and 
are some of the biggest bed
rooms that you will find on 
campus, which for some peo
ple, may make up for the lack 
of common space.
Each apartment has its 
own kitchen, which is nice for 
upperclassmen who are tired
of the food on the meal plan. 
But when you get tired of hav
ing to make your own food, or 
simply need to grab a quick 
meal, all of the Resnik eater
ies are mere minutes away.
Each of the Margaret Mor
rison apartment units are sep
arate from the others, which 
can be isolating, though often 
this is what upperclassmen 
are looking for.
Residents also have access 
to laundry and exercise facili
ties, which are on the street 
level of Margaret Morrison 
Street.
Although the common ar
eas may be a bit tight, Mag
gie Mo can offer residents the 
chance to have independence 
while still living on campus.

TXicked in a little corner 
near the edge of campus, the 
Roselawn houses offer an al
ternative to dorms or apart
ments while staying under 
the Carnegie Mellon housing 
umbrella.
The proximity to the food 
trucks and bus stops, as well 
as a Zipcar, makes this an ide
al location for a student who 
is independent, but wishes to 
stay on campus.
Roselawn has a lot of things 
going for it: private bathroom, 
kitchen, free laundry in the 
basement, and lots of living
space. The kitchen includes a 
refrigerator, stove, oven, sink, 
and cupboards, so if youd pre
fer to make your own meals, 
Roselawn is a great place 
to be. A living room, dining 
room, and basement offer lots 
of space to store your stuff, 
but the bedrooms themselves 
are very small. Bunking beds 
in the double rooms free up 
some floor space.
Because of the ample liv
ing space, the Roselawn hous
es are great for entertaining. 
As such, individual houses oc
casionally throw parties that 
can be inadvertently experi
enced by the neighbors.
The biggest drawback
(other than the price) is 
probably the condition of the 
buildings. These houses are 
old, and they never let you 
forget it. The peeling paint 
and chipped wood contrib
ute to a shabby atmosphere 
(or shabby-chic if youre cool 
enough to be able to swing 
it). Cold drafts seep in around 
the doors and windows, so 
bringing along a space heat
er is highly recommended if 
you value a non-hypothermic 
state of being.
Overall, Roselawn is a 
good compromise if youre 
on the independent side, but 
arent ready to move off cam
pus yet.

Shady Oak boasts many amenities
Style(s) of Housing: Apartments  efficiency (two students), two- and three-bedroom apart
ments (three students),, and one five-bedroom apartment (six students) reserved for special 
-interest housing 
Size: 82 students
Kitchens: In each apartment and one in the basement
Lounges: One in the basement with multiple couches and a big-screen TV
Other Amenities: Street parking available and a spacious backyard with a grill
MARICEL PAZ
Production Co-Manager
Home to Carnegie Mel
lon students only, Shady Oak 
is perfect for those students 
who want a more adult living 
space. The building follows 
24-hourquiet hours, provid
ing a more peaceful living 
environment than most other 
dormitories or campus-owned 
apartments. Each apartment 
has a full kitchen with an elec
tric stove and oven, as well as 
a dishwasher. The layouts 
vary greatly from apartment 
to apartment, with some hav
ing single bedrooms and no 
common living space, oth
ers having shared bedrooms 
with spacious living rooms, 
and combinations of the two. 
Some apartments have fire
places, which are non-functional, but are a nice architec
tural addition that makes the 
space a bit more homey.
The building provides
basics like toilet paper, light 
bulbs, and trash bags. There 
is a lounge in the basement 
with numerous couches and 
a big-screen TV. The space is 
commonly used for watch
ing sporting events as well as 
hosting study groups. Basic 
gym equipment is also located 
in the basement. For those 
students who want to keep 
an active lifestyle and dont 
get enough of a workout from 
the 10-minute walk to cam
pus, there are multiple tread
mills, an elliptical trainer, and 
a weight lifting station. The 
basement is also home to four 
washers and four dryers  
not on the eSuds network and 
that take only quarters  and 
a large table for folding laun
dry.
Venture outside and find a 
picnic table and charcoal grill 
that is always available. The 
backyard is large enough to 
play a game of Frisbee or foot
ball with friends. Across the
street, there is a bus stop for 
the 71C, which can be taken 
to go downtown to watch a 
show or to East Liberty, home 
of the Waffle Shop.
There are some drawbacks 
to living in Shady Oak. The 
plumbing has a tendency to 
malfunction, sometimes caus
ing pipes to burst, leading 
to water shut-offs to fix the 
problem. The radiators have 
also been a cause for concern, 
being set on a building-wide 
timer, which can sometimes 
shut off in the middle pf the 
night or be set at full blast on 
warmer days.
Shady Oak was originally 
one of three buildings in the 
Power Corner, along with 
Cathedral Mansions and Ve
ronica Apartments, but is now 
the only one of the original 
three that remains, as Carn
egie Mellon has chosen not to 
renew the lease for Cathedral 
Mansions or Veronica Apart
ments.

Founded by student activ
ists. in 2003 as a center for 
students interested in sustain
able living, civil equality, and 
social progress, the Neville 
COOp is a democratic living 
community. It has no resident 
assistants, only liaisons to the 
Housing and Student Life of
fices who help the Co-op solve 
housing problems.
In recent years, the spirit of 
activism has subsided, though 
the.Co-op remains a collection 
of opinionated and involved 
students who are committed 
to a variety of campus organi
zations.
Members are chosen by 
thejr demonstrated commit
ment to the Co-ops five ide
als, which are environmental 
awareness, democratic pro
cesses, racial equality, gender 
equality, and equality of sexu
al orientation.
The Co-op is divided up 
into eight apartments: four 
with all singles (either two 
or three singles to an apart
ment), and four with both a 
double and single bedroom. 
Those with doubles also have
common living areas, while 
those with only singles do 
not. Because of the plan of 
the building, though, each 
apartment is joined to one 
other apartment, and com
mon spaces are often shared 
between a pair of apartments. 
All apartments are fully fur
nished.
The membership fee each 
resident pays to the Co-op 
provides each apartment with 
an Internet connection, fully 
furnished bedroom, kitchen, 
and living areas, free laundry, 
a year-long supply of environmentally-friendly detergent, 
light bulbs, and toilet paper. 
In addition, residents have 
use of the common basement 
for storage, leisure, meetings, 
and dinners.
The Co-op is democrati
cally run through votes held 
in weekly meetings, and it 
hosts a number of activities 
each year, including weekly 
dinners cooked by members, 
open mic events, concerts, 
and forum discussions. Resi
dents pay a social fee of $75 
per year.
Coming from a quiet 
house off-campus, it has been 
really nice to be around peo
ple who are always active and 
want to have fun, said Daniel 
Schoenfelder, first-year Co-op 
resident and senior civil and 
environmental engineering 
student. Also, the dinners 
have been really tasty.
For those concerned with 
the expense of campus hous
ing, the Co-op offers many 
benefits. In addition to the 
stated amenities, the Co-ops 
rent is comparable to campus 
apartments and includes the 
summer at no extra charge. 
Subletting is permitted in the 
summer if the resident does 
not intend to remain in the 
city.
Though the Co-op has 
been the victim of several bur
glaries in recent years, a num
ber of security improvements 
were made in 2007  new 
locks were installed, keys are 
now administered through 
Housing, and safety bars were 
placed on the first-floor win
dows. There has not been an 
incident since.
The Co-op is a special 
housing opportunity that re
quires residents to apply for 
acceptance. Applications are 
due Feb. 21 and are available 
at www.nevillecoop.org/.

Fairfax Apartments is the 
perfect transition for upper
classmen to living in off-cam
pus housing. Once acquainted 
with back-alley shortcuts, its 
a quick 10- to 15-minute walk 
to campus, and its proximity 
to Craig Street, which houses 
many restaurants that are 
open late into the night, make 
it appealing to many college 
students. Running out of cash 
isnt a problem, as banks are 
located within a three-minute 
walk from the apartments.
Fairfax is a not as incon
venient as I thought it would 
have been. Wean is only a 
10-minute walk, so going to 
campus and back is not too 
bad, said sophomore biologi
cal sciences major Ajay Patel.
Inside the individual apart
ments, every room is carpet
ed, except for the kitchen and 
bathroom, which have false 
tiling. The walls, convenient
ly, are solid  a welcome 
change from the paper-thin 
dividers that separate rooms 
in some on-campus housing. 
Fairfax is also tucked away 
from loud traffic, although ev
ery now and then, a group of 
happy, shouting people may 
break the silence. The rooms 
are furnished and come pre
pared with beds, tables, and 
drawers, and the kitchen has 
a stove and refrigerator. Some 
even have dishwashers. Air 
conditioning and heating are 
included as well.
Other amenities include 
a laundry room, community 
room, and aerobics gym in 
the basement. A vending ma
chine, which sporadically 
is completely sold out, sells
different kinds of drinks for t,; 
$1.35 each. luj7
Bus stops for the 500 and 
71A, B, C, and D are also lo
cated less than half a minptes 
walk from the front door. 
Pittsburgh is on your doorstep 
if you live in Fairfax.
Laundry payment may be of 
the largest problem students 
have with Fairfax. Doing " 
laundry requires that students 
first buy a $5 card to pay for 
the machines. The card does 
not actually come with $5^ . 
students must put in money 
manually, and the machine 
accepts only bills. In addition, 
the Internet connection is not* 
Carnegie Mellon Internet, 
but rather Comcast. Finally^* 
the cost of living is one of the.lyi 
highest at Carnegie Mellonv~J 
but with all its amenities and^. 
its prime location, it is under- ^ 
standably so.

Managing Editor
Webster Hall, located at 
the corner of Fifth Avenue 
and North Dithridge Street, is 
one of the most popular offcampus residences offered by 
Carnegie Mellon Housing.
Webster is located in the 
heart of Oakland, about a 
10-minute walk from campus. 
One of the first stops on the 
Carnegie Mellon shuttle line, 
Webster offers easy access to 
the numerous restaurants, ca
fs, grocery stores, and other 
shops located in the Oakland 
area.
Carnegie Mellon rents out 
one-bedroom apartments to 
two students, and two-bed
room apartments to three 
students. The apartments are 
spacious and offer many ben
efits that dorm rooms do not, 
including a fully furnished liv
ing room, two bathrooms, and 
a kitchen. For many students, 
this escape from typical dorm 
life is the basis of Websters 
appeal.
I decided to move to Web
ster because ... I didnt like 
the dorm environment, said 
Nathan Herzig, a junior com
puter science major. I wanted 
to get off the campus meal 
plan.
Jake Loiterstein, a junior 
chemical engineering major, 
agreed. The apartments are 
nice and I love having my own 
kitchen, he said.
In addition to the spacious 
apartments, students also ben
efit from the facilities offered 
by Webster. The building con
tains a gym, a homestyle deli, 
and even an in-house hair and 
salon that offers waxing. Ad
ditionally, each floor has a 
trash disposal facility as well 
as a laundry room.
The laundry facilities can 
become a hassle for many 
residents, however. Using the 
facilities can become expen
sive, costing $2.50 to wash 
and dry one load of clothes. 
The dryers on most floors 
are not fully functional, of
ten requiring two full runs to 
completely dry clothes. For 
many students, this is one of 
the biggest complaints about
Webster.
An additional hassle can 
be the walk to campus  it is 
an average walk of about 10 to
15 minutes.
The walk to school in the 
morning isnt the best, espe
cially when were snowed in [
like these past few days, said- !
Stephanie Liao, a sophomore |
computer science major. Be- |
ing an Oakland-er, you always 
have to wake up a few minutes 
earlier in order to get to class 
on time.
Finally, one of the biggest , 
detriments to Webster Hall is 
the price. Renting a one-bed-;^ 
room apartment or a double^ 
bedroom in a two-bedroom *i -
apartment costs $7620 per t
year. Renting a single bed- !
room in a two-bedroom apart- |
ment costs $7930 per year.
Still, many students be
lieve that living in Webster is 
worth the cost.
This is my second year livw+p 
ing in Webster Hall and Infci; 
thinking about staying for 
third, said Loiterstein. .Carne 
the end, the pros definitely;;; 
outweigh the cons.  - j

Maimed in Mexico debuts at Warhol MuseumEverything you need to know
Mexican artist Enrique Metinides photographs the dead in his latest exhibitAbout finding good people and losing the bad ones
Enrique Metinides describes himself as a crime 
scene photographer. In many ways this modest 
title is apt; he shot his first dead body when he was 
12 and has worked as a newspaper photographer 
for 50 years since. When you see his work, which 
subtly reveals mankinds fascination with all things 
grotesque, the title seems humorously conventional.
Overlooking Metinides' skills as an artist in favor of 
those as a newspaperman is easy to do. Metinides is 
often described by critics as Mexico Citys Weegee, 
a fellow crime scene photographer in the early 1900s 
who often juxtaposed glamor and gore. This very 
literal interpretation of Metinides' work speaks to his 
talent within his profession.
To me, however, Metinides' work mirrors that 
of Jeff Wall, whose battle scenes are posed and 
extensively edited in order to look like surreal 
depictions of everyday life. Metinides work isnt 
simply about grief shot in good lighting; its about 
grief, voyeurism, beauty, and simplicity shot in the 
moment.
It happens to be fitting that Metinides' pop culture 
relics-turned-art-form are hung at the Andy Warhol 
Museum, on Pittsburghs North Side. Here, viewers 
are encouraged to look past the macabre, tabloid-like 
essence of the photos to sneak a peek at human 
nature.
Peoples guilty fascination with the crime scenes is 
repeatedly shown in Metinides work. In one, two 
young siblings sit dead in the back of a crashed car 
while two grown men look in through a cracked
window. The men look at the camera, guilty at 
having been caught staring at the car wreck, angry 
at being forced to look away. In another, an aerial 
view shows a mob surrounding a crash. In the corner 
of a photograph, an ice cream vendor has moved 
toward the crowd, hoping to make a profit.
Controlled chaos is also a theme in the Warhol 
Museums exhibit. In a supermarket robbery, a 
policeman wielding a gun is in the foreground.
Only when you look closer do you see a woman 
injured in the crossfire between cop and robber.
In an interview with VBS.tv, Metinides explained 
matter-of-factly that an article about the robbery was 
never printed because the supermarket where the 
robbery occurred sponsored the paper. In another 
picture, a woman has hanged herself on a tree. 
Instead of being gruesome, the image is quiet and 
beautiful. It almost seems as if she is standing on 
one of the larger roots, about to jump.
An appropriate title for Metinides is still up in the air. 
"Artist would be ill-fitting for work so based on the 
surreal details of real events. "Photographer seems 
to deny the concept behind Metinides imagery. Like 
Warhol himself, Metinides may forever have to walk 
the line between culture-bound imagery and artistic 
sentiment. For now, go determine for yourself where 
you think Metinides should stand by seeing Maimed 
in Mexico at the Warhol Museum, running through 
April 18.

Enrique Metinides' photographs of the dead are beautiful, but controversial.
Dear Rohit, 
Ive been super anti-social 
lately. Its not because 
Im depressed, its just 
because I always choose 
the wrong people to hang 
out with and they always 
end up stabbing me in the 
back later. I really enjoy my 
alone time, but Im afraid 
I might be using it as an 
escape. How can I find 
better people to spend my 
time with? 
Socially Apart 
Dear Apart,
I feel for you! But really, overall,
I think its best not to settle 
when it comes to friends, 
especially if you think youll 
be disappointed. Its just like 
significant others  you need 
to take the time to think about 
it.
Look for friends that you feel 
good around. They could 
be closer than you think, 
waiting for the backstabbers 
to scatter like roaches being 
attacked by super-strength 
Raid. These people could be 
at your favorite lounge spots, 
in your classes, in the UC by 
the black chairs watching the 
muted TV at 3 a.m.  the 
possibilities are limitless.
And if, at any point, these 
people start making you 
feel worthless, keep them 
at bay and start your search 
again. Besides, it takes a 
really mature and self-aware 
person to be able to have 
their atone time without going 
crazy about it, so feel free to 
keep doing that, as long as 
you hang out with some of 
your prospective friends too.
So long to the solo, 
Rohit
Dear Rohit, 
How can I cut the bad 
influences out of my life? I 
am talking about people in 
particular. 
Seeking Some Better 
Influences 
Dear Seeking,
You should invest in a pair 
of heavy-duty scissorsand 
no, I am not suggesting that 
you literally cut someone, 
because that would be 
wrong. Very, very wrong.
What I am suggesting is 
that you walk away from 
people who are affecting 
you in a negative way. The 
best way to go about this 
would be to confront these 
bad influences and tell them 
why you are wielding those 
scissors and pointing them 
in their direction. That way, 
they wont be coming around 
asking why you stopped 
talking to them all of a sudden 
and they wont be giving you 
the evil eye.
Make sure that when and if 
you cut those people out of 
your life, you remain open 
to accepting new and better 
individuals as your friends 
and colleagues
Youll find good people, 
Rohit

The entire trip was action-packed as we went through 
rapids between the grades of three and five (six being 
the deadly, illegal kind). The calmest moments of our 
trips were the parts when we needed to pull over to 
the side of the river to be given a safety briefing on the 
coming rapids. There were two times on the trip when 
we needed to get out of the boats and walk around turns 
in the river because they were simply too dangerous to 
pass over, but even these moments were intense as we 
needed to hike up the walls of the river valley and then 
travel down them on the other side.
After drifting through a passage known as the "grand 
canyon of New Zealand"  one of the most stunning 
sights on the trip with 100-foot cliff walls and waterfalls 
pouring down into the river from either side  we 
pulled our boats up onto the bank for lunch. Another 
meal of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches refueled our 
tanks and we walked up the stream we were parked 
next to. We hiked up some massive boulders to a cliff 
edge overlooking the stream and a 50-meter waterfall 20 
meters away from us. After a nice little group photo, we 
were allowed to jump the 15 feet into the water below, 
which was a lot of fun.
We swam to shore and then hiked back to our boats on 
the bank, pushed them into the water, and began the 
journey again. More rapids and exciting twists and turns 
left us at the end with only a few grade twos and threes 
left for us to traverse.
Further down the river on a dinky grade three, the guide 
was distracting us all with some lame little joke and 
a wave came and broadsided us, knocking me out of 
the boat. I surfaced and heard the guide telling me to 
swim to the paddle that was being held out to me while 
everyone was laughing, but I accidentally thought he 
meant for me to swim to the paddle I had dropped. So I 
swam to the wrong paddle, which made everyone laugh 
more as they were finally pulling me into the boat once I 
swam the right way.
The end of the trip had us all thanking our guides as 
much as possible. We climbed into oui cars and shouted 
some more goodbyes out the window as we rambled on 
along the road to our campsite.

flew in and touched down nearby. We were riding a 
helicopter up to the start of the river! Brian and I climbed 
in the tiny aircraft and put on the headphones inside to 
dampen the noise. Almost immediately, the pilot took 
off more smoothly than any airplane could have ever 
hoped to. We climbed about 100 feet and skimmed over 
the tree tops and across the river we were going to 
raft in, in an exhilarating ride. The pilot dipped up and 
down and side to side, giving us the sensation of being 
weightless numerous times in the smoothest and most 
fun rollercoaster ride Ive ever been on. After landing 20 
kilometers upstream after a mere five-minute ride, Brian 
and I hopped out and headed over to a few rocks where 
our guides were leading us.
As we waited for the helicopter to return and shuttle the 
rest of our friends to our position, the guide told us about 
the surrounding area. Apparently, gold runs through the 
river and some hot springs nearby I immediately started 
looking around on the ground for some gold nuggets, 
hoping to pay for the whole trip with a lucky find.
The second time the helicopter came in for a landing, 
the guide told us to brace ourselves for the wind that 
it would produce. The pilot dropped the load of rafts 
and oars before going in for a landing that I apparently 
wasn't prepared enough for. The wind blew me 
backward to a rock I hadnt noticed and I fell. The whole 
thing made me laugh quite a bit and enjoy the entire 
experience even more. The pilot then took off once again 
and gathered the others while Ed, Brian, and I pumped 
up the rafts. Once the final group of people arrived, the 
rafts were nearly completely blown up and the guides
In spring of2009, Nicholas Lamp studied abroad at the 
University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. 
While there, he met a group of friends that decided to go 
to New Zealand for spring break. Lamp decided to keep 
a journal of his trip, which proved to be worthwhile, as 
the week Lamp spent in New Zealand with his Mends 
was one of the best times of his life. The following is an 
excerpt tom Lamp's journal describing his adventure 
rafting in the New Zealand rapids.
Monday, April 13, 2009:
On Monday morning I woke up early to cook pancakes 
and bacon before heading out to go white water rafting. I 
had called the location up the night before for directions 
but the man with whom I spoke told me to make a left 
when we had actually needed to make a right, and as a 
result, we ended up getting lost. Luckily, we figured it 
out and werent too late.
We arrived at a small car park to see our guides getting 
things prepared for us. It was a very cloudy day and the 
second we all stepped out of the car, it started to rain 
and the wind began to blow harder. It wasnt looking 
like the day would be very fun; it seemed like we would 
be freezing the entire time, but the guides provided 
us each with two sets of thermal pants and shirts that 
instantly got us all warmed up. It felt as if we could stand 
at the North Pole in the middle of a blizzard and still be 
completely warm.
My friend Brian and I were able to get into our gear

Unmask the man behind the synthesizer
Dayve Hawk has revolutionized glo-fi through his multiple musical aliases
The year 2009 was one filled with new sound.
Atypical musical genres like synthpop and shoegaze 
gained popularity, and radios blared the shrill sounds 
of hypnagogic pop. While the heart of synthetic 
instruments and digital beats was developing 
in the underground scene, these new sounds 
simultaneously made their way into even the most 
mainstream of music. It truly seemed as if we were 
in the midst of a technical re volution. With these 
winds of change, there evolved a new genre of 
independent music: glo-fi.
Characterized by its heavy synthesizers and 
ambient feel, glo-fi, also recognized as chillwave, is 
a subgroup of synthpop music that emerged on the 
music scene in early 2009. With its looping beats 
and samples, glo-fi creates for its listeners a feeling 
of hazy summer, as if they are navigating their way 
through an inhabitable universe on the greatest acid 
trip of their lives.
Several artists emerged onto the glo-fi scene to 
mass approval. Included among them was South 
Carolina's multi-instrumentalist Ernest Greene, who 
released his debut EP Life of Leisure under the alias 
Washed Out. Other popular chillwave artists include 
Neon Indian, Beach House, and Toro Y Moi.
That being said, no man had more influence over the 
genre then Dayve Hawk. Hawk, the former frontman 
of Philadelphia rock group Hail Social, released his

first album, Seek Magic, under the alias Memory 
Tapes in September 2009.
The album, characterized by submerged guitars 
and delicious dance-pop, has since proven to be a 
shining star among the hipster listeners. But this is 
not the first time Hawk has seen success in the glo-fi 
music scene.
Prior to recording under the alias Memory Tapes, 
Hawk released music under the neo-disco alias 
Memory Cassette as well as the wistful pseudonym 
Weird Tapes. His 2009 Memory Cassette EP Call & 
Response was quite popular, with the song "Surfin'" 
even being dubbed the summer anthem of the indie 
nation.
But Hawk hasnt stopped there. Just last week, he 
released the special edition of his hit Memory Tapes 
record Seek Magic. The new album includes three 
new tracks  "Graphics Edit, East Per Mom, and 
"Walk Me Home  in which Hawk takes listeners 
on yet another psychedelic ride through his musical 
mind.
But what is next for this mystery artist, who at one 
point refused to even speak to the public? Although 
he has in the past refused to play live shows, Hawk 
has revealed plans to possibly find a way to perform 
with a group. Hawk has also mentioned that he 
plans to continue recording, stating that his newest 
album will be released in late 2010.

Paperhouse
On older crowds
The house lights of Mr. Small's Theatre & Funhouse come 
on and I notice a couple of facts: First, Mr. Smalls does not 
seem ventilated enough for a smoking venue; second, the 
Arctic Monkeys are fantastic; and finally, this crowd is terrible. 
Maybe it was the $30 ticket price, but almost everyone 
seemed over 40 and more concerned about the babysitter 
than the music. The crowd that night, from the bar to the 
stage, never moved. So where was the young and gunning 
college crowd? Where were the people known for kicking up 
musical storms?
Sadly, everyone was just hanging around campus. Chalk it 
up to price and distance, but no one was making their way 
out to Milfvale. Even worse, most of the people I talked to 
thought Pittsburgh just didn't have a very good music scene. 
Well, Pittsburgh may not be New York, but we certainly get 
music.
The Arctic Monkeys were one of the biggest bands to tour 
Europe back in 2006. They played chart-topping hits at worldfamous venues. Why they bothered to come to Pittsburgh I 
dont know. I just felt lucky. When the tickets were only $30,1 
was grateful. Those tickets were nowhere near the $90 Id be 
paying for the Ben Folds concert the next day.
1 flash back to all of this because once again, the house 
lights are coming on and once again the crowd is older. I can 
appreciate their taste in music now, but the lack of enthusiasm 
is a thorough buzz kill. I need a younger crowd and a girl I can 
dance with.

Lessons to be taken from the life of Howard Zinn
Two Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. students investigate the riveting work of this renowned historian
The following is an exceipt tom an obituary written by 
two Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. students to commemorate 
the life of historian Howard Zinn.
Howard Zinn died recently, on Jan. 27. This is surely not 
an informative statement for those interested in his work 
and legacy, who have been mourning this loss since that 
Wednesday. As a historian who intimately experienced 
the hottest political moments of the 20th century  like 
the Great Depression, World War H (in which he served 
as a bombardier), the Cold War, and the fall of the Berlin 
Wall  while being educated in school and academic 
environments absent of bigotry, political propaganda, 
and religious fundamentalism, Zihn belonged to 
a generation that produced most of the brightest 
intellectuals of outstanding talent and diligent effort in 
analyzing and studying U.S. society from a radical point 
of view.
Zinn now joins a number of brilliant scholars who have 
recently passed away, such as Giovanni Arrighi, Gerald 
Cohen, and Peter Gowan.
The common subject among Zinns publications is his 
rather different perspective on U.S. history, starting with 
the arrival of the first European settlers; his focus on the 
people as historys main collective agent, rather than 
the mainstream approach based on individuals; and 
anecdotal political episodes.
The concept of class struggle was pivotal. Considered 
to be one of the most important legacies of Karl Marx, 
it allows the analysis of several events of the history of 
human societies as direct consequences of historical 
dynamics that have class as their main agency.
The Great Depression of the '30s is a good example of 
how this alternative historiographical method has the 
most powerful explanation ability. Zinn experienced 
this harsh period of American history and the following 
economic recovery due to the policy measures 
implemented by the Democratic government of Franklin 
Roosevelt. Among several influences, Zinn helped us 
to understand that Roosevelts New Deal  a series of 
measures aimed to revive investment and consumption 
and to relieve the acute social problems caused by 
unemployment  was a reaction to the class struggle 
generated by the Great Depression, which could be 
objectively observed from intense social contestation, 
politically organized, toward the wealthiest sectors of 
society.
Later, during the 50s and 60s, after fighting for his 
country and seeing the rise and fall of dictatorships 
during World War II, Zinn became a strong and 
influential human rights activist in fighting against 
racial segregation in the U.S. and against ensuing wars. 
These actions were taken together with a generation of 
U.S. Marxist intellectuals that developed political roots
against conservative elites and always stood for the 
people. This generation acted as a powerful, intellectual, 
"organic collective that supported the civil rights 
movement and the fight against the Vietnam War.
In opposition to a traditional historical point of view, 
in which the masses are practiced to iconic events 
and figures mystified and created by the biased view 
of the influential elites, as a scholar deeply interested 
and involved in class struggle, Zinn was pivotal in 
establishing the American people as the central 
character of U.S. history in the notable history textbook 
A People's History of the United States, a book that has 
been present in various contemporary icons of popular 
culture, such as The Sopranos. This work, which 
faced severe intellectual persecution inside academia, 
testifies to the unique intellectual qualities of Zinn as 
a hardworking academic who was the bearer of a clear 
insight to his objectives, and a solid interdisciplinary 
intellectual background that went beyond the scope of a 
single area of study.
With few exceptions, such as the Canadian Naomi 
Klein, we dont see similar individuals in the intellectual 
firmament of the globalized world. We fear that a 
generation of brilliant intellectuals is being lost and that 
no equivalent is being generated in the global academic 
environment. The work of Zinn may provide us with the
guidelines to action and change, knowing that it is the 
people who make their own destiny.
We have particular responsibilities in the current 
historical context. We live in a period of acceleration of 
history, where substantial changes occur globally in a 
short amount of time, severely affecting our habits of 
life. Aspects of globalization like the Internet, associated 
with consumerism-oriented visual mass culture, 
can be considered factors that affect the intellectual 
development of scholars who are more worried in 
publishing fast and getting funding even faster in order 
to climb the ladder of academic hierarchy in the quickest 
way possible. This leads us to follow a path of particular 
knowledge specialization that may imply an unedited 
alienation of the intellectual intelligentsia from the social 
reality that surrounds us.
We should look to the example of Zinn as one of broad 
historical knowledge and social engagement that the 
ones who believe that a better world is possible should 
follow.

Super Bowl halftime show has lost-its spark
Media restrictions on halftime entertainment sacrifice public interest for network security
You might not remember exactly where you were on 
Feb. 1, 2004, but your jaw and the jaws of 89.8 million 
other people surely dropped at the conclusion of one of 
the most anticipated televised performances of the year. 
If the date doesnt ring a bell, maybe the term "wardrobe 
malfunction will spark your memory.
Immediately after the notorious 2004 Super Bowl 
XXXVin halftime show Janet Jackson and Justin 
Timberlake incident, the media was swarmed with 
statements from CBS, the FCC, and the performers 
themselves.
Organizers of the next Super Bowl halftime show pulled a 
180 for the 2005 performance, inviting Paul McCartney to 
the stage. This decision eliminated any possible sensual 
songs, sexy choreography, or suggestive costumes, and 
thus the risk of having another disaster like the previous 
year was avoided. After all, no one really expected 
McCartney to give a free peep show.
In the years since the Jackson incident, the halftime 
show has hosted musicians with a bit more life
experience. In 2005, McCartney performed at 63; in 2006 
Mick Jagger was 63; in 2007 Prince was 49; in 2008 Tom 
Petty was 58; in 2009 Bruce Springsteen was 60; and 
finally, in 2010, Roger Daltrey (of The Who) was 65 when 
he took the stage.
Generation Y will probably agree that the shows arent 
exactly what they're dying to see. But if one looked at 
the younger population, the halftime show acts might 
include Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift. However, Gaga 
tends to deter more people than she attracts, due to her 
whimsical, avant-garde, over-the-top costumes, and 
Swifts fans probably don't overlap too well with the folks 
who watch and attend the big game. Thus, it becomes a 
matter of catering to the audience.
Another drastic consequence of the wardrobe 
malfunction was the introduction of a delay in 
broadcasting. No longer truly live, delays allow TV 
stations extra time to cut away from something offensive 
to the viewers, should it suddenly pop up. After the 
Jackson episode, The Grammys and the Oscars, both 
in February, were cautious (implementing 10-minute
delays), as both shows featured several performances 
that, being live, could end just as disastrously as the 
Super Bowl halftime show. As time passed, though, 
delays were shortened, and now average at around 10 
seconds.
So in wondering why halftime shows dont have 
the appeal that they used to, just look back to 2004. 
Sure, if Timberlake and Jackson actually did do it on 
purpose, maybe they thought that being controversial 
would garner more viewers or media attention. If this 
is true, they surely didnt consider the consequences 
implemented for future halftime shows.
The generation gap of performers parallels the 
generation gap in viewers. And if the Super Bowl 
halftime show follows a pattern for their selection of 
performers, we can probably predict the 2011 performer 
by looking back at the top of the charts several decades 
ago.

Before Sunset is the 2004 sequel to 
the critically acclaimed 1995 movie 
Before Sunrise. It reunites actors 
Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, both 
of whom were featured in the original 
movie. The story follows our lead 
characters as they meet up nine 
years after their one-night encounter 
in the first film. It takes place in real 
time as Hawke and Delpy spend 
another night together. The movie is 
unique in that, aside from our leads 
musings on life and love, not much 
really happens. See it for a beautiful 
performance from aotors who add 
true depth to their roles.

He's Just Not That Into You
Friday, Feb. 19 
7:30 10 12:30
This 2009 romantic comedy, based 
on a book of the same title, stars an 
ensemble cast that includes nearly 
every recognizable face in Hollywood. 
The movie tells a series of intertwining 
stories about couples and third wheels 
who just cannot seem to settle down, 
despite acting alongside some of the 
hottest women on earth. Hes Just 
Not That Into You examines just how 
truly impossible it is for the average 
person to understand and correctly 
read members of the opposite sex. If 
you liked Love Actually, or enjoyed any 
other sappy film like it, please feel free 
to dive right into this flick.

Annie Hall took home four Oscars at the 
1977 Academy Awards and is widely 
regarded as one of Woody Allens best 
films. It marked a major turning point in 
Allens acting and directorial careerhe 
had made mostly strange comedies 
before this one. He added a depth and 
seriousness which his films had not 
previously been known for. The film 
stars Allen and Diane Keaton as the 
titular Annie. Viewers watch as the pair 
attempts to maintain a relationship when 
the two dont seem to entirely fit one 
another. Fun fact: Allen originally wanted 
this film to be a murder mystery, with the 
romance as the subplot.
Thirst
Sunday, Feb. 21 
7:30 10 12:30
This wonderful week of sappy 
romance comedies finishes with 
perhaps the most romantic of all 
in Thirst. Have you ever wondered 
what a love triangle would look like 
with a vampire involved and not 
including the cast of Twilight? Well, a 
failed medical experiment lets us see 
just how that would happen in this 
Korean horror/drama movie about a 
priest-turned-va&npire who is in love 
with his friends wife. The film was 
well received by critics, who have 
praised this fresh take on the vampire 
movie genre. Fun fact: Its the first 
Korean film to feature full frontal male 
nudity.

Broadway comes to the Burgh
Shows in the city introduce both actors and audiences to the perks of the Great White Way

J by Alex Yuschik | Staffwriter J
While the Big Apple may be hours away by train, 
car, or plane, New York Citys rich theater programs 
and talented performances are a lot closer than that. 
Broadway shows have marked out Pittsburgh as a stop 
for many of their performances, and many of the citys 
drama students, notably Carnegie Mellon alumni, are 
also making a splash on stages across the country. 
Pittsburgh is fast becoming a cultural hub, not only a 
city to visit for many touring shows as they make their 
rounds, but also as a fountainhead of aspiring talent.
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts history tells the story 
of the transformation of the city from industry town 
to vibrant cultural center as a series of renaissances. 
Arguably, Pittsburgh has had a long history of 
reinventing itself: going from smog and steel to , 
sustainable industry, shifting from trust belt city to a 
center for the arts to flourish. The Trust, formed in 1984 
by Jack Heinz and a small group of his friends and 
companions, made it its mission to transform the run
down downtown into an urban hub. After restoring the 
Stanley Theater, now known as the Benedum Center, the 
trust began working its way through the downtown area, 
revitalizing it with theaters, open spaces, and public art 
projects. Now, thanks to the Trust, the downtown area 
boasts over 14 different performing arts venues and is 
still going strong.
However, while having facilities to host cultural events 
is a start, other components are crucial in making 
Pittsburgh the success story that it is. Performers, 
technicians, and dramatists are needed to put on the 
shows, and an audience must come to support them.
The various universities in the city provide eager actors, 
and the smaller venues in town pro\hde great jumping 
points for a career in show business.
While the life of an actor can be fraught with challenges, 
some graduates of Carnegie Mellon's School of Music 
have achieved especially notable success in their 
line of work. Students of associate professor of music
The O'Reilly Theater located downtown was designed 
by world-renowned architect Michael Graves. The 
O'Reilly is the fourth theater project of the Pittsburgh 
Cultural Trust and the fifth Cultural District theater.
Douglas Ahlstedt have found themselves particularly 
well prepared. One of them, Liam Bonner, is debuting 
at the Metropolitan Operas February production of 
Carmen. Another, Jeffrey Behrens, will also be making 
his debut at the Metropolitan in The Nose in March. 
Graham Fenton, another former student, is in Jersey 
Boys, singing the role of Frankie Valli. Other acclaimed 
alumni of the School of Music can be found in City 
That Never Sleeps. Patricia Phillips wows crowds as 
Carlotta in The Phantom of the Opera, currently the 
longest-running Broadway production to date. Alumnae 
Catherine Walker and Christine Noll also took the stage 
by storm in the recent revival of Ragtime, which had its 
final performance this January.
Pittsburgh also has upcoming performances of its own to 
showcase its local and traveling talent: The Benedums 
spring season is packed with Broadway shows for 
the discerning theater enthusiast. Coming up soon is 
Xanadu, the somewhat whimsical tale of redemption 
and roller derbies, set in the 1980s. Sonny, the male 
lead, is a struggling artist unsure of what to do with 
his life until he meets Kira, an Australian roller skater, 
who inspires him to pursue his long-forgotten dream 
of starting a roller disco. However, little does Sonny 
know that the attractive Kira is none other than Clio, 
the muse of history, in disguise. Alls well for Clio as she 
helps her mortal query with his dream, until she realizes 
that shes falling for him. Her sisters, the other muses,

---------------------------------------------------

fit****
naturally take full advantage of her pli'ght as they aspire 
to undermine Clios position as leader of the muses. The 
show is based on a movie from the '80s that enjoyed 
tepid success at the box office but has become a cult 
classic. The theater production has made an unexpected 
splash on the Broadway scene, perhaps owing to its 
unique combination of mythology and wacky trends of 
the past. The opening night for Xanadu is Feb. 23, and it 
runs through Feb. 28.
Also coming up at the Benedum is Grease. For those 
unfamiliar with the plot of the show, the show is set 
in the 1950s and follows the lives of 10 teenagers in 
high school as they go through the familiar conflicts 
of life and love. Billed as a rock and roll musical, it 
confronted issues of gang violence, teenage pregnancy, 
experimentation, and rebellion. Sandy and Danny, the 
two main characters, go through an unresolved love 
affair from over the summer break that blossoms into 
a mess of misunderstandings and hurt feelings during 
the school year. Sandy, the new kid at the Rydell High 
School, finds that she has a lot to learn about fitting in, 
especially if she wants to be part of the Pink Ladies, 
the schools most popular group of girls. Danny also has 
to overcome his pride to accept how attached he is to 
Sandy. Eventually, after sock hops and slumber parties, 
the two finally confront each other about their feelings. 
The show runs from March 9 to March 14. Interestingly, 
Taylor Hicks of American Idol fame will be playing the 
part of Teen Angel for this performance.
Another beloved classic coming to Pittsburgh is The 
Wizard of Oz. A musical based on L. Frank Baums
Courtesy of brunkfordbraun
delightful children's book, The Wizard of Oz follows the 
story of Dorothy as she longs for a life more exciting than 
living on a farm in Kansas with her Auntie Em and Uncle 
Henry. A tornado rushes through the state, sweeping up 
everything in its path, including Dorothy, her dog Toto, 
and her house. When everything stops spinning, Dorothy 
finds herself in the Land of Oz, a different realm where 
magic is very much real and nothing is ordinary. While 
she loves being in a new place, Dorothy soon realizes 
that she misses her family and begins a quest to find a 
power that can take her back home. Advised to journey 
to the Emerald City to seek an audience with the Wizard 
of Oz, a powerful sorcerer who can solve any problem, 
Dorothy meets up with her memorable companions, 
the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. 
Naturally, the Wicked Witch of the West will stop at 
nothing to foil the heroines plans and confronts her 
at every turn. A classic way before Wicked broke onto 
the scene, The Wizard of Oz rejoices in the magic of 
childhood, all the while recalling that sometimes the 
most important things are the ones we dont realize 
we love so much until theyre gone. The Wizard ofOz 
premieres on March 30 and will be in Pittsburgh until 
April 4.
While that bevy of shows rounds out the theater scene at 
the Benedum for this spring, plans for the summer and 
early fall season are already in the works. The Benedum 
has just released plans to host The Phantom of the Opera 
from Aug. 25 to Sept. 19. The Phantom of the Opera is 
currently the longest running Broadway show. It follows 
the life of aspiring singer Christine Daa as she attempts 
to gain fame at the Paris Opera. Things arent very easy
Downtown Pittsburgh and the Cultural District, often 
considered the undeclared theater district of the city, 
is home to several theaters and venues.
for Christine: She must contend with the diva Carlotta, 
the operas star performer who refuses to relinquish 
any of her roles to the ingnue, and the affections of 
Raoul, her vicomte suitor. However, Christines voice 
is spectacular, thanks to the tutelage of her mysterious 
teacher, the Phantom. Plots and schemes abound as the 
Phantom falls for his student and takes drastic action to 
assure that she has the success and attention that she 
deserves.
Pittsburgh, though it may not be as big as New York, 
Boston, or other urban areas, is still a force to be 
reckoned with in terms of talent and performing arts ,> 
offerings. It is a city that prides itself on coping with 
new challenges and is a rising star in cultural districts 
across the country, with many opportunities for drama 
students and theater aficionados alike to enjoy its artistic 
offerings.

Valentines Day was a little sad this 
year as Peanuts creator Charles Schulz 
died just two days prior. In honor of the
10-year anniversary of his death, dont 
be the Schroeder to your Lucy this

Real music, new sound
Audiences are blown away by this years Grammy awards
The 52nd annual Grammy awards took place on 
Jan. 31 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. This 
year, like every other, topped the one before it.
Artists such as Beyonce and Taylor Swift led the 
night in winning awards. Swift took home four 
awards, including Album of the Year for her hit 
record Fearless, officially becoming the youngest 
musician to win the title. Her other wins included 
Best Country Album, Best Country Song, and Best 
Female Country Vocal Performance, all without any 
interruptions from Kanye West.
Needless to say, the nights big winner was none 
other than Beyonce Knowles. The R&B singer took 
home six Grammys, the most ever for a female 
artist in one Grammy night. She won Song of the 
Year and Best R&B Song for her hit Single Ladies" 
and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Halo. 
Kings of Leon nabbed three different awards for their 
popular song "Use Somebody," and Knowles hubby 
Jay-Z left the building with three more Grammys to 
put on his mantle. The Black Eyed Peas worrthree 
Grammys, including Best Pop Vocal Album for The 
E.N.D.
Aside from distributing awards, many celebrities 
were also there to perform. The show opened with 
one of 2009's most recognized and unique artists, 
Lady Gaga. Every time the camera is on her, we 
see her in a more outrageous outfit than before and 
dancing in an even more far-fetched style, and yet 
we continue to go back for more. She performed a 
duet with Elton John before claiming two awards 
of her own, Best Dance Album for The Fame and 
Best Electronica/Dance Song for Poker Face." After 
delivering a memorable performance of "21 Guns" 
with the American Idiot musical cast, Green Day 
won the Best Rock Album award for 21st Century 
Breakdown. Knowles soon took to the stage and 
she, along with a SWAT team of dancers, took the 
night with her performance of If I Were a Boy 
and covering Alanis Morissettes hit You Oughta 
Know. Audiences raved when Pink dangled from 
the ceiling with her acrobatic performance of "Glitter 
in the Air. Finally, in a creative collaboration, Lil 
Wayne, Eminem, Drake, and Blink 182 drummer 
Travis Barker performed Drop the World" and 
"Forever," and because the performers refused to use 
the edited versions of the two songs, the network 
profanity censors had to work extra hard on this 
performance.
One voice that is still heard in the hearts of many is 
one that is no longer with us. Where would we be in 
music without the musical contributions of Michael 
Jackson? Stunning the world even after his passing,
Molly Swartz | Art Staff
The Grammy awards are often looked upon as the 
most prestigious music award.
Jackson continued to warm the hearts of many 
through the voices of Celine Dion, Smokey Robinson, 
Jennifer Hudson, Usher, and Carrie Underwood as 
they sang along to his "Earth Song in a 3-D tribute 
to the King of Pop. Jacksons children Prince and 
Paris were in attendance to accept their fathers 
Lifetime Achievement Award, and 12-year-old 
Prince left the crowd with these words: Through all 
his songs, his message was simple: love.
While the Grammys drew viewers to the television 
screen, it also sent fans to music stores. According 
to a Billboard report, the Grammys drove a 3.3 
percent increase in album sales in comparison to the 
previous week. With the variety of artists and the 
many different genres of music represented, who 
knows what next year has in store?

Request a single. Youll be denied your request, but the 
housing administrators will feel guilty and give you a roommate 
you can tolerate.
Dont request a single. If you do, you will be placed in a closet 
and beaten with hoses. Afterward, you will be informed that 
you are to live in the closet for the rest of your academic 
career.
Acquire a taste for fried chicken livers now, because thats all 
your new roommate will eat, and he or she will insist that you 
eat with him or her every Sunday.
Dont try to live with your friends. With your... condition, that 
will not end well.
Enlarge your dorm room now! Impress the ladies with your 
huge living space! Dont wait  free samples are limited.
You have so thoroughly burned the bridge with the housing 
department that you will be stuck in the room least convenient 
to what they think your major is. Fortunately, they are wrong, 
and your location is actually quite convenient.
Dont request anything this year. Merely allow the flap of a 
butterflys wings to determine your housing fate. Next year 
cant be much worse than this year.
Your roommate will seem perfectly normal until wintertime, at 
which point he or she will disappear for days at a time. You 
will discover that he or she is a professional street luger.
Dont worry about your living situation; it definitely wont end 
with your living with your exs new romantic partner.
Dont move in with your new romantic interest. He or she 
lives all the way across town and the city of Pittsburgh will 
never clear the road.
Your roommate will have a horribly disfiguring but easily 
transmissible skin condition. Dont sit in the same chair or 
use the same shower.
You may not be able to press your new roommate into boillancing service the way you did this one. The fact that you 
need it done twice a day doesnt help.
