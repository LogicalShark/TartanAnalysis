Three fifty
Dining trucks along Tech Street stay ahead 
of the game through variety and low prices
by Anne Jolis
Assistant News Editor
Come January, Gen-Y (pro
nounced Jenny) Nguyens smiling 
face will shine no more from the 
Sunlight food truck on Tech Street. 
The NYU graduate and sawy busi
nesswoman will leave Pittsburgh 
(her hometown) for Tennessee to 
pursue a degree in nursing. But 
she promises that Sunlight will 
continue to provide the same qual
ity and value of food that students 
have become so attached to.
The Nguyen family pioneered 
the six highly successful food 
trucks along Tech Street. Gen-Ys 
parents, Giau and Coi, have been 
running Moonlight since 1984. 
According to Gen-Y, Giau creates 
the trucks with all the proper 
appliances, plumbing, electricity
and amenities needed to cook food 
and sells them to the other vendors 
for a low price.
Since Gen-Y came home from 
NYU three years ago, business has 
really taken off for the Nguyens.
I brought up the business triple 
time. I brought a lot of ideas and it 
was exciting, said Gen-Y. She 
went on to list dishes that she 
introduced to the Moonlight, such 
as spring onion chicken, spring 
onion tofu, and Beijing Chicken, a 
new item this week.
According to Gen-Y, the key to 
success is variety  Moonlight has 
over 100 items on their menu.
Its not just ideas that Gen-Y 
brings to Tech Street, though. Any 
patron of the trucks can pick out 
her ebullient face beaming from 
the glass windows of Sunlight;

Graduate students lobby 
to repeal 1986 stipend tax
by Matt Rado
Staffwriter
The upcoming national elections 
may have a significant effect on grad
uate students as they lobby to repeal 
the tax on their stipends.
Alik Widge, Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA) vice president for 
external affairs, first criticized the 
levy in early 2002. The effort first 
began in early 2002, when Widge 
attempted to get the message out and 
gain support among graduate stu
dents and University officials.
But now Widge thinks the political 
stars have aligned themselves, pro
viding at the same time what he sees 
as a favorable president and con
gress.
First and foremost, youve got an 
administration and a congress that 
are focused on cutting taxes and sim
plifying the tax code. When you have 
that climate in Washington, people 
are more amenable to these propos
als, said Widge.
Widge also sees a Congress that is 
very supportive of any proposals that 
could be viewed as being supportive 
of education. Students are fighting 
what amounts to about a $200 pay 
cut each month, or 15 to 30 percent 
of their monthly salary. Grads, say 
that while this sum may seem paltry
to many people, students are on par
ticularly small and tight budgets.
Stipends themselves were tax 
exempt prior to 1986. The Tax 
Reform Act of 1986 saw a number of 
important changes to the Federal tax 
code, including the addition of a tax 
on graduate student stipends. The act 
was the result of President Reagans 
effort to simplify the Federal tax 
code, which many did and still do 
believe is too complex.
The push received a big boost 
when the National Association of 
Graduate-Professional Students 
(NAGPS) offered its support in a 
number of ways, including offering 
access to its mailing lists, giving the 
group a national audience, and also 
giving the effort needed legitimacy. 
In addition, GSA gave Widge a formal 
mandate to pursue the effort.
Supporters stress that the effort is 
one that began at the grassroots 
level, with students simply attempt
ing to gain backing from university 
officials. When speaking to congress
men, they often mention their net
work in an attempt to show that they 
have support among a wide group of 
graduate students across the country.
Most of the efforts by the group 
have centered on lobby days, dur
ing which graduate students from

Unmanned combat vehicle: $5.5 
million. Turbine engine research: 
$5.5 million. Cybersecurity investiga
tion: $35.5 million. Intimate connec
tion with the Department of Defense: 
Priceless?
In the past 5 years, CMU has 
reaped over $350 million in 
Department of Defense (DoD) 
research contracts. During 2002, the 
DoD will provide Carnegie Mellon 
with $71.5 million  40 percent of 
the Universitys total federal research 
funding.
President Jared Cohon said that 
much of the Universitys DoD-funded 
work involves basic technological 
research, not direct weapons applica
tions. However, structural changes 
within the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), 
which previously provided funding to 
the University for general research, 
could alter that trend.
They have shifted to a much more 
focused, mission-oriented approach, 
said Cohon. Theyre giving out their 
money in smaller chunks.
In July, DARPA awarded CMUs 
National Robotics Engineering 
Consortium (NREC) a $5.5 million 
contract to develop a robotic 
unmanned ground combat vehicle. 
The agreement calls for the comple
tion of a tank prototype by the end of 
2002. Boeing will eventually produce 
the combat vehicle at its Seatde facil
ity
I will acknowledge that this is as 
close as weve come to working on a 
weapons system or a potential 
weapons systems, said Cohon. Its 
arguable whether well actually be 
building a tank. We dont know how 
to build tanks  we dont build 
weapons systems. But what we do 
very well is develop technologies that 
will be part of such a vehicle or 
weapon.
The wide range of University work 
sponsored by the DoD during the past 
five years has included turbine
The Software Engineering Institute is the only building associated with Carnegie Mellon in which classified research is con.ducted. CMU recently accepted a $5.5 million contract to build an unmanned combat vehicle.See DEFENSE, page A5

Six duplex facilities house twelve 
of Carnegie Mellons thirteen frater
nity chapters on the fraternity quad
rangle. Four of those duplexes will 
soon be dust, according to the cam
pus master plan. In their place will be 
eight single fraternity houses, in 
addition to what planners are calling 
a capstone building: a prominent 
building to be used possibly for 
admissions, a visitors welcoming 
area, and/or the presidents offices.
The campus master plan, approved 
by the Pittsburgh City Council in May 
of this year, was revealed only a short 
time after the 1987 reconstruction 
efforts were completed roughly three 
years ago, giving the campus promi
nent buildings like the University 
Center and the Purnell Center for. the 
Arts. University President Jared 
Cohon asked Kevin Lamb, director of 
Planning Services, to go to work on 
renovating other areas of campus 
that needed improving.
These areas include almost all of 
the campus that we know today: The 
North Precinct includes areas north 
of Forbes Avenue like Morewood 
Gardens and the fraternity quadran
gle; the South Precinct spans the 
College of Fine Arts all the way down 
to Hamerschlag Hall; the East 
Precinct includes Gesling Stadium
and dormitories past that point; and 
the West Precinct includes areas 
behind Cyert Hall and Newell-Simon 
Hall.
Recognizing that the central cam
pus has already been developed to 
satisfaction with the 1987 plan, 
Cohon targeted these areas for a 10- 
year redevelopment in order to iden
tify a rational build-out of the core 
campus that will ensure the highest 
and best use of these remaining 
sites, according to the master plan.
University planners, including Tim 
Michael, director of housing services, 
are in talks with fraternity members 
in an effort to collaborate on ideas for 
what will sooner or later be an almost 
entirely new design for the frat quad.
All but two of the duplex buildings 
will be razed and rebuilt according to 
standards dictated in the Campus 
Plan. University planners and mem
bers of the Greek community meet 
periodically to revise the plan and 
discuss concerns about development 
plans.
Two duplexes, located in on the 
north end of the fraternity quad, 
housing Sigma Nu and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, and Kappa Sigma and Theta 
Xi, were recently renovated and will 
remain standing. They were built in 
the 1960s, and remain in good 
enough condition for living, accord
ing to members of planning services.

This is the first time Ive heard any 
of this, said William Elliot, vice pres
ident for enrollment, commenting on 
allegations unearthed in last weeks 
Tartan article that Parkhurst man
agers mistreat workers and stifle 
complaints.
To the best of my knowledge, this 
is the first time this information has 
come to the surface, said Elliott.
Barbara Smith, assistant vice presi
dent of human resources, concurred.
If there were issues, we havent 
heard about them, she said. Smiths 
department no longer represents 
Dining though, since dining staff was
outsourced to Parkhurst. In fact, din
ing workers are not even Carnegie 
Mellon employees. Dining staff issues 
instead get routed through their local 
union, 585.
There were no issues when they 
were represented by CMU, said 
Smith.
Smith said that the change in man
agement and representation stem
ming from Parkhursts 2000 contract 
renegotiation was a pleasant and 
uneventful one.
The switch wasnt an issue. It was 
a pretty smooth transition, said 
Smith.
However, not everyone agrees. Ed 
McAfoose, has a significantly differ
ent impression.
McAfoose is a member of Staff
Council, an organization that acts for 
on-campus employees who lack rep
resentation. Staff Council used to be 
the acting body for CMUs dining 
workers before the inception of 
Parkhursts contract.
McAfoose helped make the transi
tion.
We represented the University 
employees [in dining.] They were 
quite upset about the change, said 
McAfoose. They had a sense that 
they had been here as part of the 
Carnegie Mellon family for years.
McAfoose said that all CMU dining 
employees were, offered jobs with 
Parkhurst when the management 
shifted, but that some workers were 
reluctant to go to work for the incom
ing company.
We tried to help with the situa
tion, said McAfoose of Staff 
Councils involvement in the 
changeover. We made sure that 
everyone was able to find employ
ment somewhere if they didnt want 
to work for Parkhurst.
Because Parkhurst now employs 
CMUs dining workers, Staff Council 
does not provide representation or 
mediation.
Workers with complaints would 
file a grievance through their union, 
said Smith. A union representative 
should be able to file the grievance in 
a generic or anonymous way and 
expect resolution.
But is the dining workers union,

Dealing with grief 
Italy buries its lost
SAN GIULIANO DI PUGLIA, Italy 
, (AP)  Howls of panic gave way to 
wails of grief Friday when after
shocks jolted this village as it recov
ered the last of 26 children  includ
ing all the first graders except one  
killed when an earthquake destroyed 
their school.
Two elderly woman were killed in 
their homes and a teacher was 
crushed with her students Thursday 
.as they prepared to celebrate 
 Halloween.
Officials said late Friday that the 
, final death toll was 29.
After Fridays secondary temblors,
. authorities ordered San Giuliano di 
Puglias 1,900 residents to evacuate 
the town as accusations mounted 
about shoddy construction in a 
quake-prone zone.
Illegal construction is rampant in 
, southern Italy, and prosecutors on 
.Friday opened an investigation into 
the collapse of the school, one of the 
few buildings in town that was 
destroyed by the 5.4-magnitude tem. blor.
, Critics also questioned why author
ities hadnt designated the region, 
about 140 miles southeast of Rome, a 
quake-prone area, which would have 
required stricter, anti-earthquake 
building regulations.
, -, The shock of Thursdays loss 
.turned San Giuliano Di Puglia silent 
Friday, but for the cries of relatives.
This remote, tightly knit communi
ty is composed largely of farmers pro. ducing olive oil, and many felt like a 
, chunk of the next generation was 
gone.
 In this moment more than in any 
other, you can't express your sad,ness, said 69-year-old Matteo 
Campanelli, who lost four grandchil
dren in the rubble. They were chil
dren. Lets hope the angels embrace 
.them.
He spoke at the entrance of a gym
nasium outside the town center that 
had been converted into a morgue, 
where families wailed alongside open 
caskets.
Most of the dead children had been 
covered. But a few could be seen lying 
in caskets, alongside basketballs, 
toys, photos and soccer jerseys that 
relatives chose to bury with them.
Some of the children were placed 
in large mahogany coffins when the 
town ran out of small white caskets.
Iraq policy will be 
modified, US says
WASHINGTON (AP)  Secretary 
of State Colin Powell pressed France 
on Friday to support a revised United 
Nations resolution on Iraq as Russia 
expressed a willingness to compro
mise.
Powells telephone call to French 
Foreign Minister Dominique de 
Villepin was part of a push for con
sensus on a text that retains the tough 
US-British approach to Iraqs obliga
tion to disarm.
The Bush administrations willing
ness to make marginal revisions 
stems in part from a suggestion by 
chief UN weapons inspector Hans 
Blix. According to US officials, he 
advised easing a 30-day deadline for 
Iraq to list all chemical programs that 
might have a connection to develop
ing weapons.
The dickering could improve 
prospects for UN Security Council 
approval of a resolution, but not until 
after next Tuesdays congressional 
elections.
State Department spokesman 
Philip T. Reeker said Friday that we 
are reviewing the comment of mem
bers of the Security Council but our 
bottom line remains the same.
These include declaring Iraq in 
material breach of its obligations 
under previous UN resolutions that 
ordered Baghdad to destroy its 
weapons of mass destruction and 
warning President Saddam Hussein 
that if he fails to get rid of such 
weapons, Iraq would suffer serious 
consequences.
Powell also spoke Friday with 
Foreign Ministers Jorge Castaneda of 
Mexico and Prince Saud of Saudi 
Arabia. And he talked to Foreign 
Secretary Jack Stfaw of Britain, his 
closest ally in trying to bring pressure 
on Iraq to disarm.
President Bush again threatened to 
use force with or without UN author
ity as he campaigned Friday for 
Republican candidates in Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania.
Slightly varying a familiar theme, 
Bush called Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein a threat to America and said 
the United Nations risked becoming 
nothing more than a ^debating soci
ety if it failed to get tough with Iraq.
We know hes got ties with 
al-Qaida. A nightmare scenario, of 
course, is that he becomes the arsenal 
for a terrorist network and they could 
attack America and theyd leave no 
fingerprints behind, said Bush at a 
political rally in Portsmouth, N.H.

New campaigning 
tactics employed
HARRISBURG, Penn. (AP)  
President Bush campaigned in three 
states Friday for Republican candi
dates linked to him by political ads, a 
nickname and even an old family 
feud, underscoring the importance of 
Tuesdays elections to his presidency.
Barnstorming airport hangars and 
convention centers four days before 
the elections, Bush urged voters to 
back GOP candidates because they 
stand squarely with the president. 
He has shattered fund-raising records 
and kept an intensive campaign 
schedule, putting his political stature 
on the line.
If Republicans lose ground to 
Democrats, the results will raise ques
tions about his political potency. If 
the GOP does well, Bushs agenda 
and 2004 re-election campaign stand 
to prosper with a friendlier Congress.
In Pennsylvania, Bush campaigned 
for Representative George W. Gekas, 
who hopes to defeat Democratic 
Representative Tim Holden with the 
slogan of, Let THIS George W. help 
THAT George W. Despite the famil
iar nickname, Gekas is one of the 
GOPs most vulnerable incumbents. 
In New Hampshire, Bush came to the 
aid of Representative John Sununu in 
a tight Senate race against Govenor 
Jeanne Shaheen. Sununus father 
was chief of staff to Bushs father 
until being fired. The elder Sununu 
received that news from the boss son, 
George W. Bush.
Bad blood aside, Bush joked about 
the elder Sununu at the Portsmouth 
event, calling him the old governor 
and telling the crowd, Hes still look
ing pretty spry for an old fellow.
As the laughter subsided, a smiling 
Bush said, Don't tell him I said that.
The presidents last stop was 
Kentucky, where he hoped to help 
Representative Anne Northup fend 
off challenger Jack Conway. Northup 
has touted her ability to bring federal
Weather
money home to the district, and one 
of her campaign ads shows Bush 
praising her at a campaign rally
Standing before a group of patriot
ic voters with a huge American flag as 
his backdrop, Bush told the crowd, 
Lets win one for George W!
Inconclusive tests 
stump sniper case
BALTIMORE (AP)  Authorities 
linked yet another shooting to the 
sniper suspects Friday  the wound
ing of a Maryland store clerk more 
than two weeks before a string of 
attacks began terrorizing the 
Washington area.
The two men have now been 
blamed for shooting 17 people, killing 
12 and wounding five in Alabama, 
Louisiana and around the nation's 
capital. No one was hit in another 
shooting that damaged a craft store 
window.
In the most recently linked shoot
ing, a clerk was wounded outside a 
beer and wine store in Silver Spring, 
Maryland, September 14.
Ballistics tests on a bullet fragment 
were inconclusive; the link was based 
on witness accounts, similarity of cir
cumstances and evidence putting the 
suspects vehicle in the area the day of 
the shooting, said the Montgomery 
County police spokesman Derek 
Baliles.
A week after that shooting, author
ities say John Allen Muhammad, 41, 
and John Lee Malvo, 17, had moved 
on to Montgomery, Alaska, where 
they are accused of killing one woman 
and wounding another outside a 
liquor store.
Alabama authorities said on 
Thursday that the same rifle used in 
the sniper shootings, a .223-caliber 
Bushmaster, had been linked to the 
Montgomery case.
Two days later, on September 23, 
the two men allegedly shot and killed 
a woman in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
The crime is said to have taken place 
outside a beauty supply store. The 
men are also suspects in a February 
killing in Washington state.

Indians feel shift 
in New Mexico
ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico 
(U-WIRE)  Out of the 864 inter
national students at the University 
of New Mexico, 177 are from India, 
according to the Department of 
International Programs and 
Studies.
Together they share meals and 
stories, hold cricket tournaments, 
host potlucks and celebrate holi
days.
Adaptation to life in the United 
States is made easier by the Indian 
Students Association (ISA), a for
mal chapter at UNM since 1990. 
The chapter arranges for new stu
dents to be picked up at the airport 
and housed by seniors until they 
can find their own accommoda
tions. Additional ISA meetings were 
called after September 11, 2001, 
because of increased risks and fears 
felt by the students.
Before September 11, I would 
pass Americans and they would 
smile and say hi and it was very 
pleasing, said Dham Vayalur, grad
uate student in the Department of 
Mechanical Engineering, said, 
describing UNMs previously cohe
sive community. You cant hide 
from anyone.
Then it all changed around. 
After September 11, people started 
yelling and shouting at us. It makes 
you feel that you cannot'approach 
anyone, Vayalur said.
No leeway shown 
in UA fraud case
TUCSON, Arizona (U-WIRE)  A 
University of Arizona employee was 
charged with fraud and theft after 
he spent upwards of $10,000 buy
ing items including a lawnmower 
and a satellite dish on a university 
credit card, according to university 
police reports.
Remohn Howard, 30, a senior 
application systems analyst for the 
department of molecular and cellu
lar biology, was arrested October 17 
and is being charged with three 
counts of fraud, one count of theft, 
and one count of interfering with 
an educational institution, the 
report stated.
The report charges Howard with 
using the university credit card to 
purchase a wide variety of highpriced items for personal use, 
including a lawnmower, a DVD sys
tem with monitor for use in vehi
cles, a digital camera, a home DVD 
system, a VCR, a leather chair, and a 
satellite dish.
The report also charged Howard 
with refusing to turn in receipts to 
report the purchases to the depart
ment and making changes to the 
receipts that he did turn in.
The items were recovered from 
Howards residence in Casa Grande. 
Three university detectives made 
the trip to Howards home in Casa 
Grande after obtaining a search 
warrant via telephone, the report 
stated.
Once police arrived at the house, 
they met up with Howards wife, 
Tanya. When asked by police if she

j||i War with Iraq and Saddam 
Hussein moved a large step 
closer on Wednesday as
Democratic leaders of the House 
of Representatives and President 
George W. Bush agreed on the 
wording of a resolution authoriz
ing the president to take military 
action.
Most important, the new resolu
tion does not require Bush to wait 
for the United Nations Security 
Council to approve military 
action, but permits him to launch 
an attack as he determines to be 
necessary and appropriate in 
order to defend the national secu
rity of the United States against 
the continuing threat posed by 
Iraq.
At a Brussels news conference concluding a seminar 
with the UN Panel on the exploita
tion of natural resources of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo 
on Wednsday, Annemie Neyts, the 
Belgian Deputy Foreign Minister, 
said that while the report of the 
panel undeniably underlines the 
link between the foreign troops 
that were there and economic 
exploitation of the country, it 
failed to propose ways of distin
guishing the legal from the illegal.
Immoral doesn't mean illegal, 
and this point is still unclear, she 
added.
Almost 160 participants attend
ed, including official Belgian min
istries and universities.
Looking Ahead
Moroccos Foreign Affairs and 
Cooperation Minister,
Mohammed Benaissa, will fly next 
week to Brussels for talks with 
European officials on relations 
between Morocco and the European 
Union (EU). Benaissa will speak with 
Romano Prodi, President of the 
European Commission, on several 
issues of common concern to 
Morocco and EU, said Prodis 
spokesperson.
$ The Italian authorities have 
opened a criminal probe follow
ing the earthquake in the south-cen
tral town of San Giuliano di Puglia, to 
find out why a 49-year-old school was 
almost the only structure to com
pletely collapse in last weeks 5.4- 
magnitude temor.
A quake of such intensity isnt usu
ally strong enough to knock down a 
building which has been built or rein
forced to meet modern earthquake 
standards.
Investigating magistrates who 
inspected the site on Saturday said 
they would look into whether 
manslaughter or negligence charges 
were warranted.
Its an anomalous situation, the 
collapse of an entire building. So we 
must determine if there is possible 
responsibility, said Prosecutor 
Andrea Cataldi Tassone. He stressed 
that no one was under investigation 
and there was no information yet 
pointing to anyone responsible^
understood the situation that her 
husband was in, she said, I know 
we dont have much money right 
now. Weve been going through 
financial hardships, so some of this 
seems odd to me, reports stated.
Police also asked her if she had 
ever questioned him on how he was 
able to buy some of these expensive 
items. She said that her husband 
knew that he had to get receipts to 
the business office but that UA 
didnt care, reports stated.
The three charges of fraud are all 
felonies, which could mean jail time 
if Howard is found guilty, said 
Commander Brain Seastone of the 
University of Arizona Police 
Department.
Charges of theft and fraud can 
also require the suspect to pay resti
tution to the university.
Howard was responsible for the 
maintenance of the departments 
computers, and received a universi
ty credit card so that he could pur
chase equipment he might need, 
reports stated. He was still 
employed at the UA as of Thursday, 
according to human resources.
University employees who need 
credit cards for their jobs receive 
them after being approved by their 
department head, said Misty

coordinator.
The purchase cards and the 
departmental cards are only given 
to employees and are directly linked 
to UA funds. Departments that issue 
these cards must verify the use of all 
funds.
I would say that roughly 1,500 
employees on campus have a university-linked credit card, 
McCormick said.

Guilty charges for 
driver are twofold
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A judge 
refused to dismiss charges a second 
time against a motorist with a history 
of blackouts behind the wheel who is 
charged in a crash that killed a preg
nant woman and her mother two 
years ago.
Allegheny County Judge Kevin 
Sasinoski ruled Friday that new 
vehicular homicide and involuntary 
manslaughter charges against Jack 
Monroe Smith, 51, of Bethel Park 
dont constitute double jeopardy.
Smiths attorney, William R. Bishop 
Jr., said he hasnt decided whether to 
appeal.
Judge Robert Colville dismissed 
the charges against Smith in August, 
reasoning that Smith didnt commit a 
crime because he had medical clear
ance to drive  despite the unknown 
disorder that causes his blackouts  
and was licensed by PennDOT.
But District Attorney Stephen 
Zappala Jr. refiled the charges after 
he said a county police investigation 
showed that Smith had covered up 
past accidents and withheld informa
tion about his medical condition in 
order to be cleared to drive.
Sherri Ann Zeis, 27, who was preg
nant, and Patricia Schick, 54, died 
when Smiths car struck theirs on Oct. 
18, 2000, near Century III Mall in 
West Mifflin.
Improving sewers: 
$2 billion from PA
PITTSBURGH (AP)  The state 
has given an agency $2 million to 
help it develop a plan to implement 
$2 billion in sewer improvements in 
Allegheny County.
The 3 Rivers Wet Weather 
Demonstration Project was estab
lished to help 50 of 83 communities 
in the county and Alcosan, the coun
tys sewerage authority, meet a feder
al mandate to fix the sewers.
The Justice Department and 
Environmental Protection Agency in 
1996 ordered upgrades that will pre
vent raw sewage from flowing into 
the regions three rivers when heavy 
rains occur. The overflows occur 
because those communities have 
sewers that let raw sewage and storm 
drainage run together  a method 
that was once legal, but has since 
been outlawed for environmental 
reasons.
The communities and Alcosan 
dont have the money to make the 
improvements individually. The 3 
Rivers Wet Weather project is devel
oping a joint solution that will enable 
the communities to pay for the new 
sewers.
Steady gas prices 
stay since August
MEADVILLE, Penn. (AP)  
National Fuel Gas Co., which hiked its 
rates 5.1 percent in August, will not 
raise them again this quarter, compa
ny officials said. That means the aver
age National Fuel customer will con
tinue to pay an average of $88.09 per 
month until at least February 1,2003.
Every disciple 
needs a prophet
BOSTON (U-WIRE)  Bread 
and wine turned into doughnuts 
and beer Tuesday night and 
youthful pop culture met age old 
scripture as Chi Alpha Christian 
Fellowship, a Boston University 
group sponsored by the 
Assemblies of God, held its sec
ond lecture to discuss how Jesus 
Christ was similar to Homer 
Simpson.
This sessions episode was 
Homers Odyssey, in which 
Homer attempts to make all of 
Springfield safe by putting signs 
up throughout town.
David Hill, a School of 
Management senior, said Homer 
Simpson is a character most 
people can relate to.
We kind of like the way he 
lives, he has a simple life, he 
said during the discussion. 
Homer strikes me as a purpose
less person. He wants to provide 
for his family, drink beer and 
have a good time.
The discussion looked into the 
character of Homer Simpson in 
regards to finding a purpose, 
as well as comparing the ways 
both Jesus and Homer would 
react to a situation.
I think that they are pretty 
much polar opposites, Hill said. 
He said, however, that Simpson 
was like Jesus because, he was 
always overcoming obstacles.
Chi Alpha Christian 
Fellowship sponsored this event 
as a way to mix popular culture
with Biblical studies, basing its dis
cussions of the book, The Gospel 
According to the Simpsons, by Mark 
Pinsky.
Vendors offering 
harmful desserts
PROVO, Utah (U-WIRE)  
Brigham Young University masters 
student Dave Meilstrup had a 
tongue-jerking experience with an 
ice cream bar at a recent account
ing function in the Wilkinson 
Student Center.
All I could think about was 
Dumb and Dumber and The 
Christmas Story, said Meilstrup, 
whose tongue was frozen to a 
orange and vanilla cream bar. I 
couldnt believe it was actually 
happening.
Over the past three weeks, at 
least a dozen BYU students 
received oral injuries while eating 
creamsicles supplied by BYU din
ing services.
There were free orange creamsickles at Fall Fling, and I really like 
creamsicles so I opened the wrap
per and popped it in my mouth, 
said Melissa Leininger, 20, a junior 
studying elementary and early 
childhood education.
Then it just stuck to the inside 
of my upper lip. Leininger said she 
gently tried to pull the creamsicle 
from her lip, but the frozen treat 
was firmly stuck.
I finally pulled really hard and 
it came off, but it took a chunk of 
my lip with it. I bled everywhere, 
on my fingers, on the Popsicle - 
everywhere, said Leininger, who 
then fought the crowds at Fall 
Fling to clean her wound in a 
restroom. She said her injuries 
healed in three days.

Schmidt has been CEO of Google, 
Inc., since March 2001. Before that, 
he was the CEO of Novell, Inc., where 
he pioneered the companys planning 
management and technology devel
opment. Though he is now heading 
up Google, Inc., Schmidt remains the 
chairman of the board at Novell, Inc.
Schmidt is also the former chief 
technology officer and corporate 
executive officer at Sun 
Microsystems, Inc., where he led the 
development of Java, Sun's platformindependent programming technolo
gy, and defined Suns Internet soft
ware strategy.
Google.com is widely recognized as 
the World Wide Webs fastest, most 
efficient search engine available on 
the Internet.
The company has received several 
awards in honor of their ground
breaking work in the field of search 
technology. These awards include 
Best Internet Innovation and 
Technical Excellence Award from PC 
Magazine; Best Search Engine on the 
Internet from Yahoo! Internet Life', 
and Top Ten Best Cybertech from 
Time magazine. Schmidts lecture is 
organized by CMUs Institute for the 
Study of Information Technology and 
Society (InSITeS). InSITeS thrives on 
the experience of about 60 CMU fac
ulty from a multitude of disciplines, 
on top of a national network of more 
than 35 leading legal thinkers.
The Institute fosters collaboration 
in research, curricular development, 
policy analysis and public outreach 
projects, addressing the various 
aspects of information technology.
GSIA revives old 
research center
CMU and Pitt have recently dedi
cated The Gailliot Center for Public 
Policy at the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration. The 
Gailliot Center is a research institute 
aimed at exploring market-based 
solutions to economic policy issues. It 
is directed by Adam Lerrick and 
chaired by Allan H. Meltzer, two of 
CMUs most illlustrious political 
economists. The Joint Economic 
Committee (JEC) of the US Congress 
uses the Gailliot Center as its advisor 
on matters of economic policy. 
Lerrick and Meltzer work as inteTnational economic policy advisors to the 
Majority Leader of the House of 
Representatives. The center is known 
internationally as an authority on 
international financial institutions, 
economic policy, sovereign debt 
restructuring, and development aid.
The centers goal is to develop 
original and pragmatic solutions to 
public policy problems that limit gov
ernment intervention and allow mar
kets and the private sector to evolve 
and adapt, said Lerrick.
The center was established in 1973, 
but has just been revived and redi
rected by an investment of $5 million 
from Henry Gailliot, a former local 
executive and CMU trustee, alumnus, 
and benefactor of many years. His 
contribution has been used to revive 
and firmly establish the center. 1
We have created something that I 
am extremely proud of. Everyone 
involved with the center maintains a 
common belief: markets provide bet
ter answers than regulation or com
mand and control, said Gailliot.
Dr. Gailliot embodies the mission 
and spirit of Carnegie Mellon. His 
success in business, his generosity 
and commitment to his alma mater, 
and his contribution to society have 
set the standard for all of us to repli
cate. We are very proud of the work 
that Henry, Allan Meltzer, and Adam 
Lerrick have been able to achieve 
through the Center and wish them 
continued success, said President 
Jared Cohon.

Living wage issue 
raises awareness
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
Students in Solidarity hosted a mock 
Board of Trustees meeting in honor of 
Halloween Thursday morning on the 
William Pitt Union porch.
About a dozen employees who 
work for University of Pittsburgh 
Housing Services joined the student 
group to demand better health care 
coverage.
Others used the opportunity to 
press Pitts real board of trustees to 
establish a living wage, provide 
same-sex benefits for Pitt employees, 
and halt rising tuition costs.
SIS members staged a brief, satiri
cal board meeting, with unidentified 
trustees dressed as the Phantom of 
the Opera, a bohemian, a ghoul, and 
an executioner, among others. The 
only identified member - a clown 
posing as University of Pittsburgh 
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg - 
moved under the controls of a pup
peteer behind him.
Actors made fun of Pitts employee 
benefit policies by voting to cut all 
benefits to everyone, an idea that 
the actor portraying Nordenberg said 
would make Pitt the Harvard of the 
Rust Belt.
The actors also voted to turn one of 
the Litchfield Towers into a private 
prison, mocking Sodhexo, Pitt's din
ing services provider. According to 
SIS members, Sodhexo invests in pri
vate prisons.
Though most of the audience 
played along with the lampoon, sev
eral students protested the event as 
they walked by, screaming profani
ties at the actors.
The gathering also drew a group of 
Pitt Housing Services employees 
demanding better, cheaper health 
care coverage from the University. 
Pitts janitors, maintenance workers, 
and ground crew workers received 
full health care for no charge until 
about 10 years ago, according to 
information that SIS members 
passed out at the event.
Youve head the horror stories of 
employees being yelled at, humiliat
ed in public and private, and down
graded on a daily basis by supervi
sors, SEIU member Malcolm Jarrett 
said. We want the same thing every
one else does - to be treated with dig
nity and respect.
Crime & Incident
Disorderly Conduct, 10/26/02, 
3:18 am  A caller told police that a 
group outside of Cathedral Mansions 
was being loud and possibly fighting. 
Upon arrival, police found two males 
outside smoking. After hearing a 
female_ holler Shut the fuck up, 
police approached the source of the 
voice and heard male voices coming 
from the fourth floor of Cathedral 
Mansions. Police conducted a floorby-floor search of the building. Upon 
reaching the fifth floor, police heard 
someone say get the fuck out of my 
room. Police located the room and 
heard two other male voices. The 
rooms resident was issued a verbal 
warning to stop the noise.
Criminal Mischief, 10/26/02, 
3:44 pm  Multiple complainants 
notified Campus Police of a flood in 
Doherty Hall A level restroom. Police 
found, upon arriving, one inch of 
water covering the entire floor. An 
FMS plumber found no damage to
 plumbing systems and the source of 
the flood was determined to be a uri
nal jammed with paper towels. Water 
had also drained into the elevator 
r shaft and the lab below in room B201. 
Possibly damaged lab equipment was 
valued at close to $1,000,000 in total. 
Police took Polaroids and lab assis
tants were told to inspect equipment 
for actual damage.
 Disorderly Conduct, 10/26/02, 
11:26 am  A woman stopped a 
Campus Police officer to report that 
she had been verbally abused after 
she blocked traffic in a campus park
ing lot. She said she left her elderly 
father in the car and took her daughr ter into Margaret Morrison for her 
r. music lessons. Police were able to 
locate the woman who berated the 
, other woman for blocking the lot. 
A. Both parties felt they deserved an 
apology. No charges were filed.
Risking a Catastrophe, 
10/29/02, 1:03 pm  A professor 
reported that during an exam in 
Wean Hall, there was a release of gas 
in the classroom. The Physical Plant 
was notified, and they concluded that 
the smell was likely the result of con
centrated ammonia released in the 
classroom. The instructor believes 
that a student seeking to avoid the 
exam may have released the gas. The 
professor relocated the exam, thwart
ing any would-be test dodgers.
Suspicious Person, 10/29/02, 
9:03 pm  A friend of a library clerk 
emailed Campus Police, saying that 
the clerk was being harassed at the 
video collection desk in Hunt Library. 
The clerk, a female, said the male 
actor had left a few minutes prior to 
Campus Polices arrival. She 
described the man as six feet tall, 170 
pounds, large glasses, balding, white 
hair, blue jacket, and carrying a tan 
tote bag. Apparently, the man wanted 
to check out a video but was told a 
CMU ID card was required. At this 
point, the man started telling the 
clerk about all the things he invented 
and how important the video was to 
his research. The clerk felt he was just 
rambling and became concerned 
because the man looked homeless.
Disorderly Conduct, 10/31/02. 
5:03 pm  Campus Police respond
ed to a report of an odor of marijuana 
in Morewood Gardens. Upon arrival, 
police tracked the smell from the 
reported hallway to a room where the 
smell grew stronger. Upon investiga
tion, police cited three students for 
simple possession: Sean Mossman, 
Jessica Pinto, and Terrence Stamaria. 
After citations were issued, police dis
covered open bottles of alcohol in 
plain view. Stamaria was summarily 
cited for underage possession of alco
hol. All vegetable matter, alcohol, 
and paraphernalia were confiscated. 
Police also called Stamarias mother.
Criminal Mischief, 10/31/02, 
11:55 pm  A complainant called 
Police to report that two males and a 
female had knocked over a PennDOT 
construction sign on Forbes Avenue. 
Police found the suspects along with 
another female in front of Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon. One officer went to 
investigate the sign and found it to be 
tipped over, causing a road hazard. 
After denying any wrongdoing, the 
suspects were informed of a witness 
and one stepped forward to admit 
knocking over the sign. He said he 
was leaning on it when it accidentally 
fell over. He was issued an internal 
citation.

Info session sheds 
light on assault
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
Eighty-five percent of all completed 
rapes of college women are either 
acquaintance or date rapes, accord
ing to Pittsburgh Action Against 
Rape education specialist Holly 
Opatick.
Opatick spoke to about 50 
female University of Pittsburgh stu
dents Tuesday evening about how 
to protect themselves from sexual 
assault.
Any sexual advance that is not 
wanted is sexual assault, she said, 
adding that rape occurs when there 
is force or the threat of force.
Is there any difference for vic
tims? she asked. No.
Someone being sexually 
harassed every day can feel as bad 
as a person who was raped, she 
said.
Rapes that do not occur on 
Pittsburghs campus, but rather in 
nearby areas, are not reported to 
Pittsburgh police, so students do 
not necessarily hear about them, 
Pitt student McKinley Frey said.
I think its very irresponsible, 
Frey said. She said a lot of students 
live near Bellefield Avenue, where 
a sexual assault recently occurred, 
and they should be made aware.
They do it on purpose, 
Pittsburgh student Katy Hussey 
said. In order to make Pittsburghs 
location seem safer, these rapes are 
not counted in the Universitys sta
tistics, she said.
According to Opatick, PAAR 
offers free and confidential coun
seling services for sexual assault 
and rape victims.
Since it is free, insurance agents 
do not need to be contacted, she 
said.
College victims sometimes are 
deterred from getting help because 
they do not want people, including 
their parents, to know.
Its unfortunate and fortunate 
that weve gotten our name out 
there, she said, adding that it is 
good to be useful, but that means 
that people are being assaulted.
People who need help dealing 
with a sexual assault can call (866) 
END-RAPE, 24 hours a day.
This hotline not only help victims 
of recent assaults , but many calls

Delaney said that the union is not content 
with the situation.
My supervisor wants something done, 
and if we can work together with the stu

Delaney.
Belief in the power of student activism has 
garnered a number of disciples.
Matt Toups, a computer science junior, is a 
spokesperson for People for Workers Rights 
(PWR), the campus organization involved in 
securing improved working conditions and 
greater benefits for dining and janitorial 
staff.
There is this rhetoric of community that 
the administration repeats, but they [dining 
and custodial workers] are left out. They are 
not given the chance to be part of this com
munity, said Toups.
Toups, who grew up the son of a university 
staff member, attributes his own success to 
an early inculcation into a community of 
higher learning.
And he explained that while these service 
workers were directly employed by CMU, 
they enjoyed the perks of being in the cam
pus community.
They risk getting fired if they want to go 
to the library, said Toups. Overall, there is a 
loss of benefits:,theyve lost the ability to take 
courses at CMU [full-time workers could pre
viously take one class a semester], they have 
no access to the library, and no access to 
email, said Toups.

University President Jared Cohon said at the cultural climate town meeting last Wednesday that a diversity assessment report within CIT would pro
vide a model by which diversity issues could be addressed in all seven colleges at CMU.
Cohon touts diversity at town meeting
ness as well, such as interactive theater. According to Barbara Smith, 
assistant vice president for human resources, interactive theater 
intends to promote dialogue among faculty, staff and students 
regarding sensitive classroom and workplace issues. For example, 
interactive theater is used to educated community members on sex
ual harassment. Cohon said its up to faculty to adopt and integrate 
diversity into their classrooms.
When it comes down to it, its the individual faculty, each and 
every one of them, who have to buy into this, said Cohon.
Andress Appolon, a fifth-year scholar, said she would like to see 
diversity as an integral part of a students education. According to 
her, diversity segments in a class should happen without students 
even recognizing theyre happening.
Incorporating things in our curriculum that promote diversity, 
but dont necessarily scream out diversity,  Appolon said, is a won
derful way to bring diversity into our thinking.
Some students said poor communication between students and 
administration is a problem.
Russell Borum, junior ECE major and a representative on the 
BPAC, said the committee has recognized problems with the dissem
ination of ideas and materials to students, and said hes working on 
ways to improve the speed of getting information out.
Cohon, in addressing more general signs of progress since last 
year, said the percent of African American students in the first-year 
class is 6.5 percent, which is up from 4 percent in last years class.
Michael Murphy, dean of student affairs, reported improvements 
and changes made since l^st April when the first meeting was held. 
Among those, he said, was that residential advisors underwent 
training so that more floor-specific diversity activities and discus
sions would occur during first-year undergraduate orientation. 
Additionally, twelve harassment counselors were identified for stu
dents to use as resources on campus.
He also said scripts for interactive theater are being rewritten to 
include new scenarios, and the program is expanding in size and 
depth.

. v, ,The cultural climate at CMU is unsatisfactory, said University 
president Jared Cohon at a town meeting last Wednesday dedicated 
t;p. that very question.
, /We have to be a place where any student can be comfortable, 
(jsa)d Cohon.
r)And the president said efforts to achieve this goal begin with a 
|;Qwn meeting to address cultural and race issues on campus every 
.^semester.
, jAbout forty community members attended the meeting hosted by 
^the Black Graduate Student Organization (BGSO) and the Black 
-presidential Advisory Committee (BPAC), the second town meeting 
of its kind. ^
_ .Marshall Lindsey, BGSO president, asked the President what 
progress has been made in an initiative to hire more minority facul
ty and senior administration. Cohon said the results have been slow
er than desired and attributed part of the problem to the decentral
ized nature of the University.
Because departments operate separately in recruiting and retain
ing faculty and graduate students, he has less control, said Cohon.
He did say, however, that last year CIT submitted a report assess
ing diversity claims within the department, and based on the success 
of the report, they are moving to implement that system in all seven 
of the colleges.
John Anderson, CIT dean, said the report focused on efforts to 
increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities 
recruited to the faculty.
By paying particular attention to identifying candidates for facul
ty positions in each of the departments, he said, they were able to 
increase the pool of applicants and therefore increase the number of 
offers to and acceptances by women.
- -Cohon said there are programs in place to help encourage aware
Fraternities to be razed 
new bt
PLAN, from page A1present even before I came to school 
to IFC. Since my election into IFC 
over a year ago, they have been in 
close contact, and open to sugges
tions, said Plate.
The renovations could be accom
plished in a couple ways: Either the 
fraternities will move into their new 
building first and then see the old 
one razed, or the building can be 
razed first and fraternities can 
choose to move off of campus until 
the new building is complete.
Michael thinks that the latter 
option would allow for a more expe
ditious process, although hes not 
encouraging the fraternities in 
either direction.
The current planning is condi
tioned on the hope that we will be 
able to do that in phases, so that no 
house will be displaced during con
struction, but that may not be possi
ble, said Michael Murphy, dean of 
student affairs.
According to Murphy, who has 
been involved in the planning 
process since the beginning, anoth
er concern among the fraternity 
community is cost.
Fraternity members would be 
responsible for funding the con
struction through the rent they pay 
to the university. Also a central 
issue is the exact location of each 
fraternity house, which is yet to be 
determined.
Overall though, response from 
the fraternity community in general 
has been positive, said Murphy.
There seem to be persistent 
rumors about the plan, but those 
who have been involved in discus
sions are generally very favorable.... 
In the main, even with misgivings, I 
think everyone appreciates that this 
is a good thing and necessary for 
the long term, he said.
Conversations with members of 
the Greek community confirm the 
sentiment.
The new buildings, like the cur
rent duplexes, would house thirty 
residents per chapter on the top two 
floors, plus a living area on the 
entry level and a basement for 
social functions.
Current gross square footage 
(GSF) of the fraternity buildings is 
around 10,000 per half; the new 
buildings would be anywhere from
9,000 to 9,300 GSF. Actual con
struction could begin as early as the 
summer of 2004.
The other duplexes, which house, 
as pairs, Alpha Epsilon Pi and Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon, Pi Kappa Alpha and 
! Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Delta Rho
I and Phi Kappa Theta, and Beta
Theta Pi and Delta Upsilon are the 
. buildings tentatively targeted for
razing and complete rebuilding.
The master plan, though not fully
I resolved on this matter, assumes
it this decision and replaces the four
II duplexes with eight separate buildj ings, giving each fraternity its own
|j building. These buildings would be
i arranged around three welli defined campus greens ... adjacent
1] to ... [a] large, significant building
* on the corner of Morewood and
 Forbes across from the Cut, accordj! ing to the Master Plan.
The state of the fraternities calls
* for either upgrading the existing
! buildings or replacing them, said
| Kevin Lamb, director of university
J planning, who has worked at
Carnegie Mellon for ten years 
1 From a campus planning view1 point, replacing the houses would
[ provide an opportunity to improve
* the quality of housing [as well as]
! the aesthetics of the fraternity
j| quad.
These buildings are almost fifty 
 years old. They need major work, as
any building that age would, said 
!; Tim Michael, director of housing
; services.
No need for current residents of
! these buildings to worry though,
\ Michael said, because the structural
integrity of the buildings remains 
! intact. The plumbing and heating,
however, no longer function at optimal capacity and are only some of 
' the problems that are urging uni* versity officials to start building
tj from the ground up.
The goal is to keep all the frats 
J on campus. We dont want to shove
anyone out. The easiest way to keep 
them all and manage to redesign 
\ them is to separate them into eight
/ separate buildings, said Michael.
Jeff Plate, president of the Inter 
Fraternity Council and junior ECE

originally acquired the location to use as a restaurant, but now they use it strictly 
to cut vegetables, make sauces, and store food for their Tech Street enterprise.graduate shakes up truck fare
TRUCKS, from page A1They have an ego, and wont listen to 
the advice from a small vendor. Its a 
big market, the kids are great, but 
they really dont know what to do, 
said Sree.
Srees attitude towards his busi
ness is that it should benefit the con
sumer as much as it does the produc
er, and disagrees with what he sees as 
Dining Services mercenary tactics.
You cant just put the kids in a 
tight spot and exploit them, he said.
Like the Nguyens, Sree manages to 
continue to provide a quality product 
while keeping his own costs low. 
Srees truck, which is the only one on 
Tech Street that was not provided by 
Coi Nguyen, lacks electricity. His 
food is cooked in his Squirrel Hill 
restaurant (Srees), and kept piping 
hot in the truck with Sterno gas 
lamps.
Though they define themselves as 
successful, neither Sree nor the 
Nguyens are making a fortune. No 
matter how low the overhead, profits 
just dont soar at $4 a meal. But for 
some, success is not defined in terms 
of profit margins.
Yes, we make a small profit, but 
thats not important. We make a liv
ing, thats profit enough. We have 
very loyal customers, and we take
care of them. Its not just $3.50 and 
some food; people come, they talk  
its personal, said Sree.
During his interview with The 
Tartan, Sree called out to almost 
every one of his customers by name, 
asking about their families, and 
promising a mother that he would 
pray for her sick child. The Nguyens 
take the same joy in their relationship 
with the CMU community.
My parents think of CMU kids as 
their kids. They understand being 
poor students, so they want to take 
care of your guys the way they took 
care of us [Gen-Y and her brother]. 
They take the role of parents with 
you guys, she said. To the many stu
dents who frequent the trucks daily, 
the choice seems to be obvious.
They dont charge us $8 for food 
thats not filling, and just nasty. I real
ly like variety when I eat, and the 
food trucks are where you can get 
that, said Mason Weng, a junior ECE 
major.
Its cheaper, and it tastes better. 
We come here almost everyday, said 
Jerry Tsai, a junior ECE.
According to Alex Citanna, a visit
ing economics professor from Paris, 
whether concern is nutrition, home 
cooking, or simply a sound economic
investment, the trucks are your best 
bet.
This is economics, he said, This 
is competition. It pushes them to 
make better food, and its an option 
thats cheap and varied for us [the 
customers]
It wont just be the economics of 
take-out anymore, though. The 
Moonlight crew will soon offer 
frozen versions of their popular dish
es for people looking to cook up their 
own food from home. They also plan 
to sell bottles of their sauces, a 
diverse selection ranging from the 
ever popular General Tsos sauce to 
the sauce used in their lo mein.
Successful capitalists though the 
vendors may be, their main focus 
remains to provide a service to the 
CMU community.
Gen-Y and her parents are plan
ning a Sunlight/Moonlight 
fundraiser, to occur near Valentines 
Day. The event will involve a dinner 
and dance, with the Nguyens renting 
out a space, selling their products at 
special prices and charging by cou
ple. All the proceeds will go to beau
tifying the sidewalk in front of Posner 
Hall and along Tech Street for stu
dents, faculty, staff, and of course, 
loyal truck diners.
Im up from seven in the morning 
till midnight  every day, and Im 
proud of it, she said. It gives me 
energy, its my battery of life.
In January of 2002, the City of 
Pittsburgh loosened its restrictions 
and allowed more trucks to buy per
mits for Tech Street.
Along with the five other trucks 
that set up camp in front of Posner 
Hall, was Sunlight, Gen-Ys own cre
ation.
We are the alpha and omega of 
Tech Street  the sunlight and the 
moonlight, the beginning and the 
end, said Gen-Y.
Right now, the citys limit is set at 
six trucks, for fear of taking parking 
spaces from students and teachers. 
Aside from Sunlight and Moonlight, 
the most popular food truck is Srees, 
the Indian food stand run by Mekala 
Sreevardhan, otherwise known as 
Sree.
Sree has been in business for nine 
years, operating in Building D until 
he and Dining Services came to a 
falling-out.
They have a bad attitude. The run 
it their own way  its their way or 
no way. Its not good for the campus.

DEFENSE, from page A1
engine research, integrated circuit 
design, x-ray photo analysis, and gen
eral software development.
Carnegie Mellons emphasis on 
computer science often makes it a 
prime candidate for military money. 
One of the problems of the 
University is that the government has 
chosen to put most of computer sci
ence research under the Defense 
Department, explained physics pro
fessor Lincoln Wolfenstein, who has 
been a vocal opponent of military 
research during his 54 years at CMU. 
If you want to do computer science 
research, you mainly have to get con
tracts from the Defense Department.
According to Cohon, the University 
administration does not play a role in 
the solicitation of DoD research fund
ing. Instead, professors and 
researchers lobby for contracts.
The Office of Sponsored Projects, 
led by associate provost Susan 
Burkett, must approve all contracts 
proposed by professors. University 
research policy limits the scope of mil
itary contracts that can be approved. 
It is a general policy that we do not 
accept work that is for restricted pub
lication, said Burkett.
In other words: We dont do classi
fied research on campus, said 
Cohon.
Software Engineering Institute
The off-campus Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI) opened in 
1984 under Carnegie Mellon manage
ment and DoD sponsorship. As one of 
the nations few federally-financed 
research and development centers, 
SEIs primary reason for being is to 
serve the Department of Defense, 
said Cohon.
SEI operates under one overarching contract with the DoD that is 
renewed every five years. Cohon 
plays a general role during the con
tract negotiation process. Ill meet 
with high-level DoD people to see if 
they have any issues and to reaffirm 
the Universitys commitment to the 
institute, said Cohon. After the con
tract renewal, specific projects are 
worked out between [SEI] and the 
DoD without the University adminis
tration getting involved.
Burkett reviews SEIs DoD contract 
during the renewal process but does 
not examine the specific assignments 
later added to the agreement. Nor 
does she read classified research pro
jects undertaken by SEI.
I dont review things that fall 
under security clearance, said 
Burkett.
Despite repeated requests for com
ment, SEI officials refused to disclose 
the nature or amount of classified 
research performed at their facility.
I dont know how much of SEIs 
work is classified, said Cohon. Not 
all of it is, but some fraction is. None 
of it, that I know of, is directly related 
to any particular weapons system.
SEI focuses much of its work on the 
application of capability maturity 
models, which is an advanced 
method of determining the logistics 
behind manufacturing processes. SEI 
is the leader in this field and provides 
extensive research and training to 
both private businesses and govern
ment agencies.
David Smith, a Navy program ana
lyst stationed in Mechanicsburg, 
Pennsylvania, received on-site train
ing at SEI during the mid-90s in the 
application of capability maturity 
models. He then taught the concepts 
to colleagues in the Navy and used the 
software to organize shipping sched
ules around the world.
The application of the software is
not limited to financial and business 
processes within the DoD.
They can be used for weapons sys
tems, said Smith. Anymore, 
weapons systems are like software. I 
know the Air Force used capability 
maturity models to build the F-22 
[fighter plane].
Another focus area of SEI, cyberse
curity, has lent itself to cross-depart
mental University collaboration. Last 
February, the SEIs Computer 
Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
and the department of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering created a cen
ter for Internet security and data stor
age research.
At the beginning of October, the 
new Center for Computer and 
Communications Security (C3S) 
received a 5-year, $35.5 million grant 
from the DoD.
The grant will give Carnegie 
Mellon a tremendous edge in the area 
of cybersecurity, said Cohon, who 
acknowledged that the Universitys
DoD ties produce additional funding, 
faculty, and overall opportunities for 
the school. SEI... brings a lot of ben
efits, said Cohon. It is really a very 
important part of Carnegie Mellon.
Academic Integrity
The Universitys affiliation with the 
DoD has historically drawn attention 
from community activists. Th gen
eral nature of much of the work done 
both at SEI and on campus does not 
prevent some campus and community 
members from criticizing the long
term implications of the work.
One can only imagine all the 
money and brain power used to build 
a tank, said Vincent Eirene, a 
Pittsburgh resident who has helped 
organize anti-SEI demonstrations for 
nearly two decades. We dont need to 
find new ways to destroy and maim. 
We need new ways to sustain creation 
and to help people.
Eirene believes that the professors
and staff members who engage in 
DoD-sponsored research are too far 
removed from the final application of 
their work. Were less sympathetic 
because we cant see the people we 
kill, said Eirene.
Wolfenstein is also concerned that 
the dependency of Carnegie Mellon 
professors upon DoD money may 
deflect attention from the final conse
quences of their work.
You have to make a distinction as 
to whether the money from the 
defense department is really just part 
of the basic research that the govern
ment supports, or whether youre 
doing blind research for a military 
purpose, said Wolfenstein. Most 
people dont take the time to ana
lyze.
Wolfenstein questions the employ
ment of students at SEI and has been 
a long-term advocate of academic 
freedom in the face of DoD influence. 
Former University President Richard 
Cyert established a faculty committee
shortly after the creation of SEI to 
ensure that the interests of the DoD 
would not jeopardize the academic 
freedom of professors.
Wolfenstein served on the nowdefunct committee and knows of no 
current mechanisms to uphold acade
mic integrity while under military 
influence.
Despite these concerns, Cohort says 
that he feels comfortable with the 
Universitys level of DoD-sponsored 
research. War is a bad thing.... But I 
believe what we do is ethical, in that if 
youre going to wage war, and build 
weapons systems, and youre going to 
be reliant on software, shouldnt you 
be using the best software available?
The university should not be serv
ing the military, said Wolfenstein. 
The role of the University is to teach 
all the things we know to a new gen
eration and create new knowledge for 
mankind.... I dont feel that it is the 
purpose of the University to provide 
the best technology to the military.

Flashing lights will alert 
riders of CMU escort vans
by Liz Kwak
Junior Staffwriter
Students who previously 
eschewed the universitys escort ser
vice may soon have reason to give 
the vehicles more than a passing 
glance or a glance as they pass.
Campus Police and University 
administration are considering pro
posals to improve the often disap
pointing system.
One change that would enhance 
communication between escort dri
vers and students would be the clear 
marking of all designated escort 
stops.
A work order has been placed by 
the university to paint the sidewalk 
at these specific locations.
Another potential change entails 
the installment of a lighting system 
inside buildings at stops. The lights 
would be activated by the escort dri
ver, who would call into the system 
approximately one minute before 
his arrival at each destination. The 
major benefit of the lighting system, 
especially in the winter, is that stu
dents would not have to wait in the 
cold for escort.
While this system would be 
extremely helpful in the winter 
months, there is concern over the 
safety of riding in a car with a driver 
trying to perform multiple tasks. As 
a result the plans are still in their 
preliminary stages.
Were still exploring many differ
ent avenues. We want to find a way 
that will above all serve the students 
the best we can, said Sergeant 
William Ricci, a campus police vet
eran who has overseen escort and 
shuttle service operations for over 
20 years.
Initially designed to accommo
date deaf riders, the alert system 
carries with it alert benefits for the 
entire campus community. But do 
not expect to stay toasty in the UC 
staring at an alert light this winter.
University officials anticipated 
that the system would have begun 
near the start of the semester, but 
blamed delays on technological and 
hardware setbacks.
Ricci said the implementation 
now appears near, that the new 
technology could be fully opera
tional in a day, a week, or a month.
He is not sure.
Unlike undeveloped suggestions 
for an alert system, students can 
already contact escort drivers
directly via driver cell phones, com
pletely eliminating the dispatcher 
middleman, allowing would-be rid
ers to learn of shuttle location and 
request pickup.
Escort drivers are also required to 
possess a commercial drivers 
license and must have some kind of 
experience as a professional driver, 
ranging from work as chauffeurs to 
truck drivers.
Currently, CMU employs eight 
personnel drivers, whom students 
can describe with more than a few 
anecdotes of responsibility shirking.
Ive noticed that there is one bus 
driver in particular who does not 
leave the Underground when hes 
supposed to so he can play arcade 
games, said Marija Wilson, a senior 
biological sciences major.
Id been waiting outside Baker 
Hall with some friends for a while 
when the escort van drove past us. I 
found out later that the bus was full, 
but we would have really appreciat
ed if they could have stopped for a 
second to let us know, said Vanessa 
Gerber, junior mechanical engineer
ing major.
Besides common courtesy, 
promptness of the service is also a 
student concern.
I would ride escort a lot more 
than I do now, but Ive heard escort 
has a tendency to be late. Since I 
cant rely on it, I try to avoid riding it 
if I can, said Adrienne Chu, a 
sophomore computer science major.
Unlike the escort system, the 
number of complaints about the 
shuttle service, another transporta
tion service offered by the universi
ty, is comparatively small.
The shuttle operates for several 
hours in the morning hours and 
early evening hours. With three spe
cific driving routes, the shuttle ser
vice does not allow students to 
request a preferred location, greatly 
minimizing variation. Alternatively, 
escort enables students to be trans
ported to a desired location within 
certain boundaries.
Ricci believes transportation 
mishaps can be held to a minimum 
if students use the resources provid
ed wisely.
Pamphlets that contain all rele
vant information about the escort 
and shuttles services are available at 
the UC info desk.
The Campus Police website also 
provides help on schedules, loca
tions and other information at

around the country organize in 
Washington and meet with a number 
of senators and representatives and 
their staffs. Many of them begin in a 
meeting with Widge and others in 
which they discuss exactly how they 
should present their ideas and gener
ally what the work of the day will 
require. They then spend most of the 
day in meetings with either congres
sional delegates or their staffs.
Although they have yet to find a 
legislator willing to sponsor their bill, 
Widge said that many members of 
congress said they would support the 
legislation, but Widge declined to 
identify them for fear that they may 
back down. It seems many of the 
efforts legislative supporters have 
simply said they agree with the bill, 
and they would willing to sign on as a 
co-sponsor, but not until the students 
find a sponsor.
In the house, roughly 20 out of 45 
representatives that have been 
approached said they would be will
ing to put their name on the bill, 
while almost all offered their general 
support, said Widge. Although they 
have focused on legislators belonging 
to the Finance committee in the 
Senate or the Ways and Means com
mittee in the House, the lobbying 
efforts of the students are seeking a 
broad range of bi-partisan support.
Widge believes they will achieve 
success sometime in the next year.
Theres enough momentum to 
keep this thing going to completion. 
Widge sees a large amount of support 
for the proposal in Congress, and is 
confident that they will soon find 
someone willing to come forward as a 
sponsor. While it is unlikely that the 
legislation will be passed by the end 
of this session, the effort to get the 
bill introduced forges on regardless.
Supporters believe that the bills 
immediate presentation could help 
increase its support, though it would 
have to be introduced again in the 
next session of Congress. According 
to Matt Cronin, a GSIA student 
involved in repealing the stipend tax, 
introducing it now would create 
enthusiasm for the effort and help to 
increase its support.
Students will next descend on 
Washington, D.C. on February 19-21 
for the next scheduled lobby days to 
find a champion for their bill.

Depression strikes millions- indiscriminately. Depression is simply a suppression 
of brain activity that makes life unbearable. And even though depression is 
readily treatable, only 1 in 5 ever seeks treatment. Why do so many just drag 
themselves along or eventually seek relief through suicide? First, there's the lack 
of awareness of depression- as an illness and as the threat that it is to each and 
every one of us. Second, there's the unwarranted negative stigma attached to it.

CMU West raises standards
Thursday.
Nintendos strong marketing push 
and array of new mature games may 
help them attain a foothold in the 
gaming market across all age ranges. 
[Nintendo] could do exceedingly 
well this Christmas, said Mike 
Laidlaw, console editor at 
Adrenaline Vault, a gaming review 
website.
Although the console gaming mar
ket makes billions of dollars annual
ly, analysts still question whether the 
three major console companies will 
each be able to get a slice of the pie 
large enough to prosper and remain 
competitive. Microsofts Xbox has 
rapidly picked up momentum, sport
ing some of the most advanced hard
ware, and Sonys Playstation 2 has 
the widest range of games available.
Theres always been an old adage 
that the market cant support three 
systems, said Laidlaw. In the past, 
when three game companies have

reviews, see next page.
competed for the console market, 
one of the companies has ended up 
failing or falling into the back
ground. Sega, for example, was dri
ven out of the industry as a hardware 
manufacturer.
Laidlaw thinks this time may be 
different. Weve never had huge 
titanic companies battling it out 
before, he said. I think this might 
be a time when the three can coexist 
 not necessarily in harmony, but 
theres enough to support three sys
tems.
With over 180 games available for 
the Gamecube by 2003 and many of 
the new games geared toward older 
gamers, Nintendo hopes to position 
itself for a strong seat in the gaming 
market.
Ask Jack: Unix commands
by Jack Wu
Staffwriter
Dear Jack,
I have a CSW test on UNIX and 
networking commands coming up. I 
have gone to the classes but I really 
still dont know anything. My 
teacher sucks! I asked some friends 
of mine but they dont know much 
about this stuff either. I was won
dering if you could give teach me this 
CSW stuff so that I dont get screwed 
on the test.
-Andres
Dear Andres,
CSW is just the best class, isnt 
it? If you need help with CSW 
specifically, there are course docu
ments which cover what you 
learned in class on the BlackBoard 
website.
But in regards to your question 
about UNIX commands, I can glad
ly help you out! Here Ill tell you 
how to use the most important 
commands in UNIX. I will use the 
*% character to denote the begin
ning of a command prompt.
- To open up a UNIX environ
ment on a Windows box, start the 
program NiftyTelnet and log in.
- In a UNIX environment, you 
can view the help or manual 
page for almost any command in 
UNIX. To view the manual, type: 
man commandName. Example: % 
man cp
- To run commands in the back
ground, you type in the name of 
the program followed by the 
ampersand character. So to run 
the Mozilla web browser and have 
the terminal window remain avail
able for more commands, type: 
mozilla &.
- To copy a file from one directo
ry to another, type: cp
< path 1/filename > <path2/file
name >. Example: % cp
myfiles/hello. txt public/hello.txt
- To move a file, type: mv <file
name > <path2>. Example: % mv 
hello.txt myfiles/
- To delete a file you type: 
rm [-r] < pathname/filename >. 
The -r allows you to remove all 
the files in the directory you speci
fy. You can use * as a wildcard 
when specifying by pathname. Be
very careful with using this wild
card. Example: % rm -r will 
remove all files from the current 
directory and all subdirectories 
ending in ~, so be very careful.
- You can convert a file to exe
cutable by typing: chmod u+x
< filename >.
- To list the contents of a path
name, type: Is [-alprRs] <path>, 
where the characters a prints all 
files, 1 returns long format, p 
shows which files are directories, 
r prints in reverse order, R 
recursively prints all subdirecto
ries, and s gives file sizes. 
Example: % Is -a
- To change your present work
ing directory, type: cd <path>.
is used to represent your home 
directory. To advance to any users 
directory, use username. 
represents the current directory, 
and represents the parent 
directory. Example: % cd

Most students have at least heard 
of the mysterious West Coast campus 
started by Carnegie Mellon in 2000, 
but what most of them dont know is 
what exactly goes on at the 
Universitys Silicon Valley location.
Commonly referred to as CMU 
West, the campus is located on the 
grounds of NASAs Ames Research 
Center at Moffett Field in San 
Francisco. The 55 students currently 
enrolled in the programs there are 
working towards a Master of Science 
degree in Information Technology in 
either software engineering or ecommerce. CMU West hopes to 
expand the graduate programs to 
include degrees in human-computer 
interaction and network security.
An attractive aspect of having the 
campus in Silicon Valley is the prox
imity of high-tech companies. This is 
one of the reasons Carnegie Mellon 
came out to the California area in the 
first place, to showcase the educa
tional and technical innovations that 
the school has to offer and to form 
partnerships with corporations such 
as Lockheed-Martin, IBM, and Cisco.
Marcos Schumacher was brought 
in to plan the content for the software 
engineering side of the program. 
Himself a graduate of the MS 
Software Engineering program at 
CMU in 1993, he designs the general 
program, staffs the company men
tors, and works with companies to 
provide the content needed for stu
dents to pursue their degrees in soft
ware engineering.
Education for the 21st Century
Several aspects of the Silicon 
Valley campus make the educational 
experience there truly cutting-edge. 
Students participating in the Masters 
programs have company personnel 
who act as mentors, many of them 
former CMU graduates themselves.
Mentors are the equivalent of pro
fessors. Although there is no perma
nent faculty assigned to the campus, 
CMU West uses many other forms of 
education, such as videoconferencing 
with professors and classes at the
main CMU campus.
We try to send the university to 
the students instead of bringing stu
dents to the university, said 
Schumacher. Difficulties lie in trans
lating the course topics into a format 
and timeframe both accessible and 
achievable by students there. Some 
students have experience with 
online-only courses, and the staff of 
CMU West are attempting to expand 
on this idea and bring the experience 
to graduate students. Lectiires by fac
ulty and guest speakers can be 
accessed either while theyre occur
ring or afterwards via webcast or 
recorded video, respectively. 
Students can also use the latest in 
remote learning technology and fol
low course material through online 
bulletin boards and online discussion 
groups.
Teamwork
CMU West is set up to allow stu
dents to decide how time-intensive 
they want their presence on campus 
to be. Instead of assignments, the stu
dents work on real-life products. 
Students work in assigned groups on 
software projects from CMUs corpo
rate partners. The process of learning 
how to deal with the problems of 
modern software development is sep
arated into milestones. These are 
checkpoints at which groups are 
expected to make a minimum 
amount of progress in applying what 
they learn to the project at hand. The 
study programs flexibility makes it 
attractive to employees of area corpo
rations. Companies find the ability 
for their employees to keep work 
commitments while attending higher 
education to be attractive, said 
Schumacher.
Groups can meet according to a 
schedule that is custom tailored for 
its collective members. Students who 
live in the Moffett Field area can meet 
twice a week or more to collaborate 
on their projects while students who 
live and work away from the campus 
can arrange for meetings on timeta
bles shared by the group members, 
such as once or twice a month. As 
more students of a specific type (local 
or remote) join the program, theyre 
placed in groups of similar needs.
Expert predicts global cooling
by Kristin Lala
Personnel Manager
Leading environmental experts 
say that global warming may cause 
not a heat wave, but an abrupt cool
ing of the global climate. If the cur
rent situation continues, scientists 
predict a drop in temperature signif
icant enough to freeze rivers and 
destroy agricultural areas  but not 
enough to cover the continent with 
glaciers.
Some scientists theorize that if 
cooling does occur, the Atlantic 
region  including Europe and the 
United States  could experience 
drops in average winter temperature 
by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. This 
shift in the balance of our environ
ment has the potential to last for 
hundreds of years, and perhaps 
more startlingly, it could occur with
in a decade.
Robert Gagosian, president and 
director of the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) 
wrote in a recent WHOI Web page 
publication that he believes disrup
tions of ocean currents, possibly 
caused by effects from global warm
ing, are likely to trigger a wide
spread change of climate.
Gagosian explained that although 
the atmosphere changes rapidly, the 
Earths oceans change slowly. The 
atmosphere is a rabbit. It moves 
fast, he said. Atmospheric changes 
are manifested as storms, or cold 
spells and heat waves that last for a 
few days. However, according to
Gagosian, oceanic changes are slow
er  like a turtle  gradually 
becoming altered over many years. 
Yet because the ocean contains 
about 1,000 times as much heat as 
the atmosphere, it has the potential 
to do much more.
Changes in ocean circulation can 
set the stage for large-scale, long
term climate changes, Gagosian 
wrote.
The Great Ocean Conveyor
The phenomenon of abrupt cli
mate change centers on the oceans 
global system of heat circulation, 
which is known as the Great Ocean 
Conveyor. The Conveyor regulates 
global heating by transporting heat 
north and south in its current, and 
the Gulf Stream is a critical source of 
this transfer.
The Gulf Stream carries heat from 
the tropics  the approximate flow 
rate of 75 Amazon Rivers, says 
Gagosian  to the east coast of the 
United States and further on to 
northern Europe.
As the Gulf Stream moves into 
colder latitudes (such as those near 
Greenland), the ocean loses heat to 
the atmosphere, increasing the den
sity of ocean waters.
The result is what Gagosian 
describes as a sinking mass of cold 
water, which travels southward 
from the North Atlantic. This cold 
current propels the Gulf Stream to 
travel northward again, and the

How Stuff Works: Melting ice
by Joe Elliott
Staffwriter
With winter approaching, salt bins 
are being filled in preparation for the 
inevitable first snowfall. Salt, and 
other ice-melting chemicals (known 
as deicers) work by lowering the 
freezing/melting point of water so 
that it is lower than the ambient tem
perature, and the unwanted ice 
melts.
Relatively pure water turns to ice 
when it is cooled to 32F (0C), but a 
1:9 salt/water solution wont freeze 
until 20F (-6C). Likewise, a 1:4 
solution wont freeze until it reaches 
2F (-16C). At temperatures lower 
than 6F (-15C), spreading sodium 
chloride on icy pavement has no 
effect at all  thats why youre more 
likely to see sand spread on the road 
in extremely cold climates: melting 
the ice is next to impossible, but the 
sand provides some traction. The 
trouble is that salt wont react with 
completely solid ice  it has to first 
come into contact with some liquid 
moisture to form a brine, or saltwater 
solution, that can penetrate through 
the ice to form more water. On road
ways, friction with vehicle tires gen
erally creates enough heat to melt a 
small portion of the ice and get the 
process started.
Other, more effective, chemical 
alternatives exist, but most local gov
ernments consider them to be too 
expensive to spread on the roads, 
even though they wont contaminate 
groundwater and topsoil as quickly as
salt (sodium chloride) does. Almost 
all commercially available deicers are 
made from some combination of salt, 
calcium chloride, magnesium chlo
ride, potassium chloride, and urea. 
Calcium chloride deicers generally 
provide the best performance, work
ing at much lower temperatures than 
salt can  down to -25F (-32C). 
Calcium chloride and. magnesium 
chloride are also better at initially 
penetrating ice at low temperatures 
than other chemicals.
Another drawback to salt and some 
other chemicals is the fact that as 
they dissolve in water, they draw heat 
from their surroundings, reducing 
temperatures even further and some
times marginalizing the effects they 
have on the melting point of the 
water. Calcium chloride and magne
sium chloride, on the other hand, 
release heat into their surroundings 
as they dissolve into water, which 
facilitates the melting process.
Another factor that affects both the 
effectiveness and cost of deicers is 
their physical shape  the more 
expensive, pellet-shaped versions of 
these chemicals are much more effec
tive. Due to their small contact area, 
they tend to work down rather than 
horizontally, so they penetrate the ice 
and facilitate easy removal without 
overuse of chemicals. Deicer flakes, 
on the other hand, work horizontally 
and have no effect on the bond 
between ice and pavement, meaning 
that an impractically large (and envi
ronmentally dangerous) quantity of

The Nintendo Gamecube has 
sometimes been called the kiddie 
cube for its large number of games 
geared towards children (e.g. 
Pokemon). Nintendo is eager to 
change that image with a slew of 
games geared towards the older age 
groups being released this holiday

and Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance 
are among the selections targeting 
older gamers.
New releases like Resident Evil 0 
and Metroid Prime are based on 
well-known and successful series
that many older gamers are familiar 
with.
Additional marketing dollars aie

Nintendo targets older gamers for the holiday season
Metroid Prime
by Alex Meseguer
Assistant Science & Technology Editor
When most 12-year olds think 
about Nintendo, they think Mario. 
But many older gamers may recall 
other characters like Samus Aran of 
Super Metroid fame. On November 
18th, Nintendo takes a crack at a 
sequel for the Gamecube  Metroid 
Prime.
The game opens with Samus 
answering a distress call from a mys
terious derelict spaceship. As Samus 
turtle-shaped spaceship gracefully 
docks for investigation of the ship, 
one is reminded of the breakthrough 
game Homeworld, with its not-quite 
organic graphics and bright energy 
signatures from engines and forcefields.
Attention to detail is readily appar
ent in the construction of the game 
mechanics and stage layout. Perhaps 
the biggest change fans of the Super 
Nintendo version will notice, besides 
the updated graphics, is the change 
in perspective. Now youll be blasting 
space pirates and saving the universe 
from a first-person view.
Players exploring Samus environ
ment will have to scan to extract 
information and advance the story
line.
At first, scanning objects is a nifty 
departure from the automatic HUD of 
many first person shooters (FPS), but 
may become very old, very fast for 
some people.
Nintendos attention to detail also 
shows up in Samus visor. Visor 
effects include juicy space alien guts 
splattering all over your field of 
vision and rain drops coalescing and 
sheering off the glass.
Also, if you blast something at 
close proximity with a charged shot, 
you can catch a glimpse of Samus 
eyes in the reflection, if youre lucky. 
Its small details like this that make 
an okay game good or a good game 
great.
Other features appear due to the 
introduction of the third dimension 
into the gameplay. A simple targeting 
system allows the player to strafe and 
lock missiles onto enemy targets. 
Altogether your standard FPS fare. 
Surprisingly, the grappling beam 
makes a reappearance, as well as the 
different types of armor and the mor
phing ball, along with the different 
types of weapons at the players dis
posal.
The game seems to be noticeably 
geared toward the older gamer. The 
difficulty is appropriately jacked up 
and the story is presented in a man
ner reminiscent of the Super 
Nintendo style, but with all the bene
fits that the hardware power of the 
Cube affords. Many impressive 
effects are possible with a processor 
that outpowers even that of the 
PlayStation 2 (10.5 GFLOPS vs. 6.2 
GFLOPS). With a graphical makeover 
and gameplay enhancements, the 
familiar storyline of Metroid Prime 
will have gamers old and new blast
ing their way to the store to pick up a 
copy.
Resident Evil 0
by John Davin
Science & Technology Editor
When Capcom Entertainment 
announced in September 2001 that it 
would be transferring the popular 
Resident Evil series to the Nintendo 
Gamecube, many gamers were sur
prised, and some were upset. 
Nevertheless, with the upcoming 
release of Resident Evil. 0 on 
November 12, Nintendo is set to 
prove their worth in developing an 
outstanding prequel to the Resident 
Evil series (hence the zero in the 
title). Capcom has claimed that 
Resident Evil 0 will have the best 
ever graphics in a video game. While 
this is a tall order, the game just may 
fill it. The graphics are truly impres
sive  they are highly detailed and 
use advanced lighting techniques, 
including realistic display of shad
ows.
Resident Evil 0 follows the story of 
a special police task force that is 
stranded in the forest after a heli
copter crash. They stumble upon a 
train wreck, and soon after entering 
it, they are attacked by bloodthirsty 
zombies. The main character, 
Rebecca, who fs a member of the 
police force, meets Billy, an escaped 
convict, on the train. She reluctantly 
partners with him due to the dire cir
cumstances. In the game, you have 
control over both characters and can 
switch between them anytime you 
want.
The Resident Evil series has been 
known to sometimes have issues with 
design bugs. While I was playing 
Resident Evil 0 in the Nintendo game 
van, I ran into an interesting situation 
on the first level. I was fighting a 
monster who was supposed to trigger 
a plot event after a short period of 
time. I kept shooting him and he 
wouldnt die; eventually I ran out of 
bullets. Now I discovered that I had 
no knife, and Rebecca was not capa
ble of fighting with her hands. I had 
already used all the extra ammo in 
the level, so that was no help either
 I was defenseless. I resigned 
myself to certain death and let the 
monster attack me. But he couldn't 
kill me  his attack moves did noth
ing!
So here I was with no way to win 
and no way to die  completely 
deadlocked. I decided to try exiting 
the room; and suddenly that trig
gered the plot sequence that should 
have occurred a while before.
But these bugs are not likely to 
seriously disrupt your game, and the 
game is otherwise an excellent addi
tion to your library. One thing worth 
mentioning is that it can actually be a 
scary game  something to give you 
nightmares. The ambient sounds and 
music contribute to the overall 
spookiness of the game. Because of 
the confined nature of a train, you 
will not necessarily see the zombies 
coming from a mile awaythey may 
surprise you by popping up right 
behind you when you least expect it. 
Resident Evil 0 is an excellent choice 
for a stormy, rainy night.

CLIMATE, from page A8
cycle of ocean circulation continues.
The effects of global warming 
could actually be partly responsible 
for the predicted trend of abrupt 
global cooling in the North Atlantic 
region. Scientists think that global 
warming may be responsible for the
40 percent decrease in Arctic sea ice 
over the past few decades.
Global cooling can occur when the 
Great Ocean Conveyor slows or 
shuts down entirely. This can hap
pen when the North Atlantic is 
unable to absorb fresh water, which 
then builds up and congests the cir
culation system.
Excessive amounts of fresh water 
might come from any number of 
sources, including glacial melting or 
increased rainfall.
Predicting Climate Change
The process of predicting abrupt 
climate change is twofold, says Klaus 
Keller, associate professor of geo
sciences at Penn State University. 
First, there is evidence that abrupt 
climate change has occurred in the 
past. The most recent instance is 
known as the Younger Dryas, which 
began around 13,000 years ago and 
lasted 1,300 years. Researchers esti
mate that this severe cold spell 
developed within a 10-year span, 
and believe that the most likely 
explanation for the Younger Dryas 
event was a sudden change in ocean 
circulation.
Proof of the Younger Dryas and 
other cold periods comes from ice 
cores, which can be chemically ana
lyzed to determine the atmospheric 
temperature during certain periods 
of snow.
The interpretation of [ice core 
measurements] is that the climate 
system is highly variable and sensi
tive to perturbations, said Raymond 
Najjar, associate professor of meteo
rology and geosciences at Penn 
State. It is kind of amazing that the 
records show such rapid tempera
ture change during the last ice age 
because we dont see such variability
today.
The second way that researchers 
examine abrupt climate change, 
according to Keller, is through mod
eling.
By using computers to model the 
ocean and the atmosphere, scientists 
can examine what might happen 
when different levels of carbon diox
ide are forced into the system, there
by increasing warming and, in some 
models, decreasing the circulation 
of the Great Ocean Conveyor.
People use numerical models to 
gain insight into the functioning of 
the [Great Ocean Conveyor], said 
Najjar. You can shut down the 
Conveyor in some models if you put 
fresh water into high latitudes, 
something that probably happened 
in the past and some models suggest 
might happen in the future.
However, all analyses of the prob
lem do not agree over the effects of a 
weakening in the Great Ocean 
Conveyor.
The problem is that geological 
evidence tells us that [Great Ocean 
Conveyor weakening] can happen 
very fast, but the models show if you 
increase the CO2, its not so fast, 
said Keller. The predictions are cer
tainly not set in stone.
Such model predictions can cer
tainly be improved, but researchers 
believe that they constitute the best 
available predictions at this time. 
One question, for example, is how 
rapid the climate change caused by a 
weakening of the Great Ocean 
Conveyor would be. Many scientists, 
including Gagosian and Keller, 
argue that the system can behave 
like a light switch that can either be 
on or off.
Great Ocean Conveyor at risk
Researchers say that there are 
numerous signs today pointing 
towards a deterioration of the Great 
Ocean Conveyor. According to 
Gagosian, one indication is the 
Greenland Sea, where the sinking 
rate of surface water has decreased 
nearly twenty percent in the last 
thirty years. And in the Arctic, the

Technology in the classroom is 
becoming more ubiquitous every 
year  professors use infrared 
remote controls to direct slide pre
sentations, students have access to 
the Internet from every classroom, 
and some classes are even taught via 
teleconference or webcam. Soon, 
biology classes will be able to view 
an entire anatomical model of the 
human body from any angle or slice.
The Pittsburgh Supercomputing 
Center (PSC) has released an appli
cation that is used to display large 
volumes of 3D data from any angle 
or position.
The Volume Browser, as its 
called, so far is primarily used to 
view a large collection of data on 
womens anatomy, called the 
Visible Human Female. The 
Volume Browser allows a 3D model 
to be viewed on any axis.
The software can be used in 
anatomy classes to give students a 
better idea of how different organs 
overlap in 3D space. However, the 
Volume Browser is not limited to 
viewing biological data. The soft
ware could be used to view other 
data sets that will be collected, such 
as geological data or the airflow 
from turbines. The other datasets 
that are currently available are 
anatomies of two mice.
Arthur Wetzel, a computer scien
tist at PSC and leader of the Volume 
Browser team, believes that in the 
future, mice data sets will be used 
more in research. The mouse is a 
common experimental animal, and 
by doing single-gene knockouts, the 
relationship between a gene and its 
observable traits can be studied. A 
single-gene knockout is the removal 
or deactivation of one gene in an 
organisms DNA. This helps scien
tists to see what proteins are related 
to that gene, and what about those 
proteins change.
According to Stuart Pomerantz, 
the programs primary developer, 
users can bookmark places within 
the volume, keeping the location, 
magnification, and orientation of 
the slice. The bookmarks can be 
copied from machine to machine, or 
even included within a hyperlink on 
the Internet. This opens up the 
opportunity for anatomy instructors 
to assign classes to mark a particular 
organ, and then send in the answer 
electronically.

An abrupt climate change in our 
climate is one of the worst case sce
narios in the global change debate, 
said Spyros Pandis, associate profes
sor of chemical engineering and 
engineering and public policy at 
CMU, via email. Most scenarios 
assume that small changes in the 
energy balance of our planet will 
lead to small changes, on average, of 
our climate.
Although small changes generally 
do not trigger major climate 
changes, there are no definite rules. 
Our planet is a complex dynamic 
system, and it is possible that a small 
change can make us move far from 
the current climate state, wrote 
Pandis.
In the past, Gagosian says, sudden 
cooling of the climate led to emigra
tion in search of environmental and 
economic stability.
Today, with sixty percent of the 
worlds economy based in the North 
Atlantic region, the implications of 
abrupt climate change are serious, 
particularly for those in weatherdependent industries, such as fish
ing or farming.
Keller noted that the economic 
analysis of climate change is a grow
ing field that needs more work. He 
said that it is important to look at the 
ripple effects that global climate 
change may have on the economy.
If you change the agricultural 
yield by twenty percent in Europe, 
what are the effects? Maybe its not 
so difficult there because they can 
buy from other places, but what if 
this happened in Africa, he said.
In order to respond to potential 
climate shifts, said Gagosian, 
increased research is key. The best 
way to improve the effectiveness of 
our response is to have more knowl
edge of what can happen  and how 
and when ... the more knowledge 
we have  the more reliably we can 
predict changes  the better our 
chances.
mode.
Eventually, Wetzel would like to 
see other features in the Volume 
Browser.
We are in the early stages of 
adding time as a fourth dimension 
so researchers can view dynamic 
processes like respiration or long 
term processes like mouse embryo 
development, he said.
One difficulty with this is that cur
rent scanning technologies have no 
way of continuously scanning some
thing long-term like an embryo. 
Instead, snapshots would have to be 
taken, and the individual images 
morphed together to form a cohe
sive whole.
Pomerantz said the programmers 
would like to make the Volume 
Browser so easy to use that it can be 
as easy to use as a web browser.
The Visible Human data was first 
released to the public in November 
1994, with the Visible Human Male. 
Approximately one year later, the 
Visible Human Female came out. 
Each of these volumes was very 
large for the time  15 GB for the 
male and 40 GB for the female. 
Today, these files could probably fit 
on most CMU students hard drives.

tions. The major requirement is a 
very fast Internet connection. 
Currently the Volume Browser is 
highly bandwidth-intensive, need
ing a connection providing 5 Mbps 
or better. This is because the data is 
not stored locally on each computer 
but instead is run off the memory of 
the server. This allows for much 
faster load times (on good connec
tions). A system known as WeblOO 
also aids in connecting at optimal 
rates by automatically changing 
parameters in order to maximize 
speed.
The PSC Volume Browser has been 
released for several platforms, 
including Windows (from 95 to 2000 
officially, though it appears to run 
fine on XP Professional), Mac OS X, 
and Solaris. Builds for Mac OS 10.2 
and Linux should come out with the 
next release, which also promises 
better data compression. This will 
aid people with slower Internet con
nections in viewing the data.
An official release date for the 
next version has not yet been set, 
though both Wetzel and Pomerantz 
anticipate that it should be available 
around the end of November.
The Volume Browser allows the user to view organs (the heart is pictured in this 
view) from sagittal (side), coronal (front), and transverse (top) views.
Deicers harm 
environment
ICE, from page A8
deicer is required to completely 
clear an area of ice.
All readily available deicing 
chemicals can damage plant life if 
used in excessive amounts, but salt 
is the worst. All of the chlorides 
will accelerate rust in unprotected 
metals, but urea wont. Urea, how
ever, is effective over an even nar
rower temperature range than 
salt. Overusing deicers is a fre
quent mistake made by both gov
ernments and individuals that 
results in environmental damage. 
A small amount of these chemicals 
will begin to break down the struc
ture of the ice  and break the 
bond between the ice and the 
pavement  facilitating mechani
cal removal (by a snowplow, for 
example). Dumping huge 
amounts of deicer on the road and 
waiting for complete melting is 
costly and slow. Plant life (and 
steel cars) will suffer as a result of 
the high chemical concentration. 
If youre using ice or another 
chemical to clear ice from your 
driveway or walkway, always fol
low the manufacturers instruc
tions and be prepared to manually 
clear the loose ice that remains 
after the chemicals have done 
their job.

sponsored research committee
Administrators claim that through all of 
it's' Department of Defense-sponsored 
research, Carnegie Mellon has never 
engaged in direct weapons systems devel
opment. But the University is blurring the 
line between theoretical research and 
physical weapons implementation, in light 
of this past summers $5.5 million grant to 
develop and build Spinner, an advanced 
unmanned ground combat vehicle  a 
robotic tank.
The deal, which was signed with a con
sortium of the Robotics Institute, con
trasts distinctly with the Universitys typi
cal research, and represents a step onto a 
slippery slope. Additionally, the
Universitys reliance on DoD-sponsored 
research funds, much of which goes to 
classified projects in the Software 
Engineering Institute, means CMU runs 
the risk of becoming a one-trick pony.
By accepting a contract that intimately 
involves Carnegie Mellon researchers in 
the conception and production of a com
bat-oriented machine, the University is 
living up to the charge of some local 
activists: Carnegie Military University." 
Despite the prestige and compensation 
that accompany such deals, the University 
ultimately commits considerable effort to 
enhance the effectiveness of tomorrows 
war fighter, as the CEO of a contract 
partner said.
Regardless of the ethical dilemmas of
war, practical application of research is a 
trademark of the Universitys identity. 
Partnerships with corporations and gov
ernment agencies provide material for 
project courses, internships for students, 
and money for faculty. Thats a valuable 
learning tool whether it come from Intel 
Corporation or the Department of 
Defense. However, Carnegie Mellon 
should be clear, honest, and consistent 
when it accepts funds from these entities.
A current examination of the research 
policy by Provost Mark Kamlet should not 
only identify the concerns of faculty, stu
dents, and staff, but also provide unequiv
ocal answers. Unless the University should 
like to repeat the embarrassment suffered 
last spring, when it was revealed that the 
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was 
studying redistricting options for the 
Republican-controlled state legislature.
The committee should also address the 
apparent contradiction with the schools 
Spinner venture. Cohon said the 
University does not build weapons sys
tems, but an unmanned combat vehicle 
sounds like a tank, looks like a tank, and 
probably shoots like one too. While it is 
not considered classified research  
something Cohon flatly says will not be 
accepted on campus  it clearly repre
sents a deviation from the past proscrip
tion on weapons research at the 
University.
California dreamin: Feds should 
wake up, respect ganja rulings
i As a rule, The Tartan has always 
believed that good things happen to those 
virho wait. Thats why it was such a boon to 
our good spirits  and democracy  
when a federal appeals court in San 
Francisco last week ruled that the govern
ment may not abrogate the practices of 
those doctors who recommend marijuana 
to their patients. The October 29 decision 
upheld a lower-court ruling that blocked 
federal authorities efforts to chip away at 
a 1996 California initiative. The law, 
Proposition 215, allows for patients with a 
written or oral doctors recommendation 
to grow and possess certain amounts of 
marijuana. For five years now, the initia
tives wording has been clear: licensed 
doctors may recommend, not prescribe, 
the substance to patients, the vast majori
ty of which suffer from chronic and debil
itating diseases.
Apparently, though, Attorney General 
John Ashcroft and his mouthpiece in the 
Drug Enforcement Authority, Asa 
Hutchinson, consider the federal courts, 
California voters, and state rights to be 
insignificant in their crusade to save the 
US from ganja-smoking cancer patients. 
Hutchinson, upon his appointment to the 
DEA post in August of 2001, dismissed 
decriminalization of marijuana possession 
and medical usage out of hand, citing 
their conflict with federal law. 
Meanwhile, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, 
Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and 
Washington all have similar laws. And a 
TIME/CNN poll conducted the week of 
October 21 revealed that 80 percent of 
respondents favored the distribution of 
marijuana for medical purposes. The mes
sage couldnt be clearer for Ashcroft and 
his. drug czar.
_ But, instead of respecting federalism 
and the will of its people, the US govern
ment has repeatedly decided that a dated, 
Puritanical drug policy should trump 
democracy. For example, since the US 
Supreme Court ruled last year that there 
existed no medical necessity to grow mar
ijuana, the DEA has taken this as a call to 
target so-called cannabis clubs like the Los 
Angeles Resource Cooperative (LARC), an 
organization that provided the lions share 
of the substance to the ill. At the same 
time, the agencys policy of confiscation 
has been inconsistent. Some collectives, 
like LARC, have been shut down in a flur
ry of publicity and bravura. Others, how
ever, have been tolerated in an inconsis
tent policy which eliminates dozen-plant 
farms while turning a blind eye to some of 
a hundred acres or more. Instead of this 
selective system, which keeps some ille
gal business afloat while scuttling others, 
wouldnt it be more appropriate and less 
financially burdensome to defer to states, 
as Justice John Paul Stevens said in his 
dissenting decision in the High Court, in 
situations in which the citizens of a state 
have chosen to serve as a laboratory in the 
trial of novel social and economic experi
ments.
DEA raids, like the one against LARC, 
must stop. If the federal government 
keeps on talking out of both sides of its 
mouth with regard to the War on Drugs  
razing a few farms here and there to keep 
up appearances  it should be open to 
reexamining certain policies that hurt a 
handful of otherwise law-abiding citizens 
while putting zero dent in the much larg
er, more violent illegal drug trade. Five 
years ago the Californian people spoke up. 
On October 29 a federal appeals court 
upheld their right to speak for coherent 
drug policy. Its high time the US gov
ernment, Ashcroft, and Hutchinson 
opened up their ears and listened.

Dont silence readme
Dear Editor,
Im writing in response to an article in the October 28 issue titled 
Readme articles evoke student disdain that mentioned various 
students who were offended by the humor paper. I agree that jokes 
can in fact cause real harm to certain groups and that the writers 
should keep this in mind and respect the subjects of the jokes. 
Having said that, I believe that readmes ridiculously overboard
parodies shed light on stereotypes and misconceptions harbored by^ 
community members andinstead of encouraging themreveal 
their ignorance and cruelty. It is indeed sad that some people 
might actually believe its true, but it is their own loss. I hope that 
censorship of readme never becomes necessary, since one of the 
most respectable characteristics of this campus is being able to 
express even the most absurd opinions.

Artificial coloring doesnt add flavor to CMU life
Andrew Johnson
Women performed a traditional Indian 
dance in the opening act of CMUs talent 
showcase last Saturday. The women werent 
all Indian. Among them were Indians, 
Asians, whites, and maybe more that I didnt 
see. The group embodied the diverse nature 
of our University, our towering international 
population.
Following this first act, the emcees of the 
show came on to say a few words about the 
performance, and about what was to come. 
They jested. They were witty. The two were 
diverse as well - a male and female of dif
fering ethnic descent. The female emcee 
ended her part of the bit by praising the 
University diversity that the group embod
ied.
And the concept came clumsily to her lips, 
just as it comes clumsily to all of our minds. 
She choked on the words and I paraphrase:
This group is good because all of the girls 
arent Indian.
The diversity is good mantra is drilled 
into our heads all over this country of ours, 
and Carnegie Mellon is no different. We 
invest an inherent superior value in people 
who are different than others. In these per
formers, we look past their dance and music 
for a moment to consider a quality granted 
them by mere fact of their melanin concen
tration.
Today we value a research group more 
highly if it is made up of a white, an Indian, 
a black, and an Eskimo than one composed 
solely of Chinese people.
I cant make a strong case for any inherent
benefit in making 
sure that any campus 
has an interesting pat
tern of ethnicities.
There is no reason 
why an all-black foot
ball team would be 
made any better just 
because it acquired 
some white players. I 
see no reason to 
ensure the University 
has students from 
Kentucky or
California.
Carnegie Mellon 
now rests heavily on a 
very intangible 
resource, an asset 
without substance, an 
endowment without
equity. In short, its premium marketing tool 
of diversity has no practical quality, other 
than it looks pretty on campus literature. Its 
not surprising, then that we tout something 
we acquire so easily.
I dont actually think that the folks of 
Warner Hall are diabolically scheming about 
how to pull the wool over everyones eyes, 
though I certainly know that University 
Advancement saw a winner in diversity. I do 
believe that the University and the world in 
general need to take a careful look at placing 
so much stock in something whose benefits 
have not been universally agreed upon.
Its easy to see why many of us buy into 
the argument for varied skin color. But I 
think its a distinct possibility that diversity 
is just an easy way to teach people tolerance. 
We teach people the other extreme to 
racism. We teach people to seek out qualities 
in people that make them different and
File Art
value them for that, no matter what.
I hope that society will eventually find the 
happy medium superior to both. In some 
cases, I look for qualities that make people, 
similar to me; and sometimes I want to be 
more similar to others. I want to hang out 
with people of my sex sometimes. I want to 
be part of the team sometimes. I think that 
in the case of this talent show, the difference 
in skin color contributed nothing to the1 
beauty of the performance. Its just kind of 
random. People are no better or worse for 
their particular cultural background.
And as I heard the emcee struggle with 
her praise, I knew her heart was struggling 
with a concept her education took for grant
ed. And I struggle with it, too.

The South shall whine again
Butler High School flag flap should be about education funding
Brad Grantz
Only recently did school boards deter
mine that high school students should learn 
that the Civil War was first about money, yet 
we continue to indoctrinate elementary 
school students with the belief that the same 
war was over slavery. Its not so surprising 
that teachers and the public were as enam
ored with the image of Abraham Lincoln as 
benevolent savior that they would perpetu
ate this Civil War myth for over 100 years.
History can be brutally honest. There are 
anachronisms (like the Civil War) so con
founding even by collegiate standards that 
we study them, largely to identify some 
thread of causation with todays problems.
But what does public education teach in 
rural western Pennsylvania?
In the Butler school district, 40 miles 
north of Pittsburgh, the school board deci<&- 
ed about one month ago to ban the 
Confederate flag on the grounds of ethnic 
intimidation. A handful of black families 
had complained to the superintendent after 
several students arrived to a Homecoming 
event in early October wearing the rebel 
flag. One student, who had painted his pick
up truck in General Lee fashion, ala the 
classic southern drama The Dukes of 
Hazzard could no longer drive his vehicle to
school. Perhaps the most embarrassing 
moment for the district came when junior 
Matt Cole showed up to school with an art 
nouveau tattoo of a Dixie heart on his 
shoulder. Cole showed his body art to prin
cipal Dale Lumley, who was reportedly 
slightly perturbed at the skin display. Cole 
was suspended when he concluded the dis
pute with a singular fuck.
Some students have defended the rebel 
banner as a tribute to the soldiers who 
fought and died for the South. Coles father 
Robert told Dennis Roddy of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, These kids are hillbillies  
they dont bother anybody. They like fishing 
and hunting and country music.
Robert Cole is probably right, but hes also 
naive. Cole and his friends know that the 
flag conjures mixed messages. Just as the 
Confederate flag is a symbol of a youthful 
rebelliousness and a southern heritage that 
deserves preservation, its as abhorrent to 
blacks as is the swastika to Jews.
In a community where blacks are as for
eign as international students, evening news 
crime reports and images of decaying Rust 
Belt towns like Duquesne have a more 
meaningful effect on the education of rural 
white youth than a textbook passage. Since 
the state relies heavily on local funding of 
public schools and, consequently, local con
trol of school districts, places like Butler cre
ate a simplistic characterization for complex 
explanations of socioeconomic borders: 
blacks and their communities are different
than whites and their communities.
Reserving a single month for the study of 
Black History is the kind of narrow-mind
ed, secularized approach to study that 
breeds a resentment of blacks among white 
students. And, if you go to a poor rural 
school district, but receive no special consid
eration when you apply to college or for a 
job, why should someone else because of the 
color of their skin? Explain that to Butler 
high school students. Class divisions exist 
especially in the most desperate of towns.
What Cole and his friends dont learn in 
Butler High School is that even though 
blacks account for 10 percent of 
Pennsylvanians, they make up 55 percent of 
the prison population. Or that many young 
blacks are at a systematic disadvantage 
because they are born and raised in the West 
End and not Westchester, NY. Its economic 
irony that Cole and his friends have more in 
common with the black youth in depressed 
areas like Duquesne than they do with white 
youth in Upper Saint Clair.
It has everything to do with money and 
nothing to do with race. Ignorance can only 
perpetuate misunderstandings, and in the 
worst cases, intolerance. The Butler school 
board hopes to create a discussion on race 
relations, but what good is talking about the 
matter if everyone present was from Butler?

Paint-by-numbers law: 
useless lawsuits ought 
to be brushed aside
q.CJ:vJl( tn:vJD1
No doubt most readers have heard of examples of litigation 
run amok. Theres the criminal who sues a homeowner for 
shooting him while he robs the homeowner. Theres the infa
mous fast food guy suing restaurants because he got fat from 
eating Big Macs. Finally, there are the people suing the paint 
industry for lead-based paint that hasnt been sold in almost 
25 years. Luckily, some sanity returned to the system this past 
week when a lead paint case in Rhode Island was declared a 
mistrial.
Lead has been used in multitudes of products from gasoline 
to paint to even toothpaste. After a growing body of evidence 
proved that lead poisoning leads to brain damage and devel
opmental problems, particularly in children, government 
stepped in to ban most applications. Today we have unleaded 
gasoline, lead-free solder for cans, and, of course, lead-free 
paint.
However, lead-based paint was only banned in 1978, leav
ing millions of older homes in the United States with this type 
of paint. Most people dont even realize they have it. When 
they pulled up the red shag carpet and painted the walls a 
more palatable color, the previous owners of my house most 
likely covered any lead based paint with a much friendlier 
lead-free latex.
Therein lies the issue with lead paint litigation. As long as 
any existing lead paint'is properly maintained, it poses no 
threat to children or anyone else. The danger comes when 
lack of maintenance, rework, or demolition frees the paint in 
the form of dust or paint chips. Small children can then easily 
ingest the paint since anything and everything is fair game for 
the mouth of an eight-month-old baby.
People have filed numerous lawsuits against the paint 
industry, seeking compensation for medical bills, pain and 
suffering, and possible future effects of lead poisoning. Some 
have succeeded, but most have failed for numerous reasons. 
Rhode Island took the initiative as the first state to try paint 
companies for creating a public nuisance. Had Rhode Island 
won the case, future juries could have then decided what 
companies, if any, were liable, and what damages may have 
been due. These damages would have been used for remedia
tion of lead-based paint, medical testing, and so forth.
The problem with Rhode Islands case (and with all lead 
based paint lawsuits) lies in the fact that the hazard occurs 
when a third party fails to act in a responsible manner. Most 
children exposed to lead chips are poor and minorities. They 
live in either public housing or low-rent housing, both of 
which are notorious for poor maintenance. It is the chipping, 
peeling paint or paint dust caused by shoddy workmanship 
during renovations that creates the threat to children. 
Electricity can be deadly, too, but we can buy outlet covers.
Additionally, Rhode Island conceded that it possessed no 
evidence whatsoever of a single child succumbing to lead poi
soning in any state-owned building. Rhode Island essentially 
argued a case based on the potential for damage to the public, 
and four of the six jurors correctly found that that this lack of 
evidence essentially negated Rhode Islands case.
Since the judge declared a mistrial, Rhode Island can try 
again. Several states await a win for Rhode Island to start 
their own cases against the paint industry. Lets hope Rhode 
Island fails again and again and again, if necessary. If we 
learned anything from the tobacco litigation, I hope its that 
litigation is a poor substitute for legislation.
Youll note that I never claimed a health problem or threat 
does not exist. Rather, one exists due to poorly maintained 
paint. If, indeed, millions of children are exposed to this 
threat, then a better solution would be a federal Superfund 
type tax on all current paint that would be specifically ear
marked for remediation- If implemented, such a program 
would have numerous benefits over litigation.
First, it would be more fair and equitable. If 50 states decid
ed to sue paint companies for money, paint companies would 
be subject to 50 different decisions. Some states could win 
money, while others fail. One also has to work out the diffi
cult task of figuring out who sold how much paint when and 
where to assign responsibility. A special tax would also evenly 
distribute the costs to all current paint consumers.
Second, any tax revenues generated would be used much 
more efficiently. Rhode Island is paying private lawyers 17 
percent of any winnings it gets. Thats 17 percent of money 
down the drain before any benefit is even realized.
Finally, and most importantly, a tax backed by legislation 
would ensure that the money is used for paint remediation. 
Several states used part of their tobacco litigation money not 
for health care costs or anti-smoking campaigns but to shore 
up budgets, fund education, and hand out political goodies. I 
see no evidence that paint-based litigation would be any dif
ferent.
Of course, this all assumes that such a tax would pass.
Thats an iffy question thats better left to the legislative 
process. Lets just hope in the meantime that Rhode Island 
isnt able to find six jurors dumb enough to buy their argu
ments.

The scariest thing at CMU is the 
work load. People willing to work more 
than play.
Young voters tune out on old political games
Ben Hackett
Today, there are more Get Out The 
(Teen) Vote campaigns than there are 
voters to actually get out and vote. Rock 
The Vote and other programs target teens, 
telling them to cease pushing PS2 buttons 
and to start pulling some levers at their 
local polling station. Compelling people to 
vote is at the very least benevolent, and on 
some basic level what one would consider 
civic duty.
However, the very people who are being 
instructed to vote are not being informed 
about what their politician is going to do 
concerning the most pressing issues in 
their lives. Mostly due to a lack of partici
pation, the 18-30 vote is ignored. Those 
ignored voters terminate their interest in 
the process at large, creating less of a rea
son for politicians such as Ed Rendell or 
Mike Fisher, candidates for Pennsylvania 
governor, to pay any mind to the youth 
vote. Pandering to an aging population, 
which seems to make for clever campaign 
strategy at the moment, is in actuality 
going to dig their political action commit
tee contribution-larded graves.
But not today.
The lack of participation in the 18-30 
age group voting would appear as a logical 
reason for politicians to pay less attention 
to the youth vote. That said, we must 
examine why voter participation in that 
age range is so low.
A recent opinion poll, commissioned by 
Gannett. News Service, showed that of 
Americans 31 years or older, 62 percent 
view voting as a constitutional duty versus 
59 percent of 18-30 voters who believe 
that voting is simply a choice. One could 
attribute this change in thought to an 
increasingly socially liberal thought 
process in society. Voting, once heralded 
as a civic obligation, has been reduced to a 
simple black and white choice, like decid
ing whether or not to attend ones 8:30 
lecture.
The major issue here is that politicians 
are playing shortsighted politics with a 
select group of issues, rather than 
addressing all the pressing issues across a 
spectrum of voters. The pandering 
towards the elderly, and the issues sur
rounding this age group, have skewed 
American politics, leaving a bad taste in 
the mouths of younger voters, most of 
whom are not waiting for their Social 
Security checks or prescription drugs. 
Throw into the equation some scandal and 
an increasingly conservative vision of gov
ernments role, and you have a result that
leaves us with an unprecedented lower 
aggregate of youth voters.
The Washington Post reports that 
younger voters are more likely (3 out of 5) 
to favor some privatization of Social 
Security and to endorse the idea of school 
vouchers. Both of these issues have been 
mostly ignored in the 2002 campaigns. 
The issue of education, normally a hotbutton issue, has been mostly swept aside 
in favor of prescription drug relief for the 
elderly and a flight from any mention of 
-gasp- privatization of Social Security.
Scandals and mud-slinging detract from 
the pressing issues young voters care 
about as well.
Why, when I want to hear about educa
tion reform, do I hear about politicians 
accusing each other of scandalous deal
ings every day? Yes, ethics are important, 
but theyre attempting to get elected to 
balance budgets and pass legislation. They

Intolerance, racism required learning at CMU
Nasser Abukhdeir
Why dont you go back to where you came from?! a voice 
shouted, greeting me as I was harshly awakened in my red sleep
ing bag late last year.
Half asleep, both my dog and I looked up towards the sweatsuit 
clad student who blurted this as he walked towards Doherty Hall 
for morning classes. I had spent the cold winter night in front of 
The Fence to be a part of a mock refugee camp organized to 
protest military action against Afghanistan after September 11th.
While I have many times wished I was back in Kingsville,
Maryland, I am quite sure this student was not insisting I return 
to my suburban home town.Unfortunately, growing up as an 
Arab-American has prepared me for such racist comments and 
attitudes; I have endured them all my life. The difference was 
that I was on the CMU campus, a respected institution of higher 
learning, tolerant and open.
The fact is that racism against minorities is prevalent in the US, 
and our campus is not immune to this disease. People of African, 
Arab, and Jewish descent, among others, have been subjected to 
discrimination by individual citizens, governmental agencies, 
and the news media.
One of the pressing issues today is racism towards Muslims and 
Arab Americans in the US. Our campus has seen several incidents

University condones racism against Arabs with upcoming speakers
ARABS, from page All
that show these racist attitudes are alive and 
well at the University.
Several of these events occurred in the 
spring semester. Some of them were minor; for 
instance, posters were put up claiming that 
Palestinian mothers were turning their chil
dren into terrorists in hopes of payment. Other 
anti-Arab acts were more confrontational, 
including disruption of a National Palestine 
Week (NPW) silent vigil for civilian deaths in 
the occupied territories of Israel. The partici
pants in the vigil suffered verbal abuse and 
humiliation when disruptive anti-Palestinian 
activists shattered the moment of silence. The 
Tartan covered National Palestine Week in its 
April 15, 2002 edition.
One individual who was simply walking to 
the UC was called a Nazi by one of the dis
rupters, apparently based on her dark com
plexion. But racism on campus is not limited to 
high-profile events like NPW. Simply walking 
around campus with a hutta, a traditional 
black-and-white Arabic scarf, elicits occasional 
stares and dirty looks.
Racism against Arabs is also not limited to
individuals on campus, but also to CMU-affiliated groups. One upcoming example is the 
Objectivist Clubs sponsored speaker, Yaron 
Brook, who in an article written by Brook earli
er this year, he states: The alleged right of 
Palestinians to self-determination is ground
less.
This denial of an unalienable right according 
to international law also denies the Palestinian 
people their humanity. He goes on to assert 
that only Arabs living in Israel have accepted 
Western values such as individual responsibili
ty, property rights, and the rule of law. The 
obvious implication is twofold: that these val
ues are not accepted in the Arab world, and 
that these values are uniquely Western. Brooks 
claim that the Arabs do not accept such values 
as the rule of law is clearly racist. The fact 
that a University-sponsored group invited this 
man is a disturbing sign of how acceptable 
anti-Arab racism is becoming at CMU.
Unfortunately, the Objectivist Club is not the 
only campus organization that challenges 
morality Carnegie Mellon. The Hillel Jewish 
University Center and Chabad House are co
sponsoring Daniel Pipes to speak at a local 
venue. Mr. Pipes is, to say the least, a contro
versial figure. He has on numerous occasions 
made racist comments directed towards people 
of Arab and African descent. Two examples 
include:
...black converts tend to hold vehemently 
anti-American, anti-Christian, and antiSemitic attitudes.
 Daniel Pipes commentary about black 
Muslims in the US, 6/1/2000
The Palestinians are a miserable 
people...and they deserve to be.
 Daniel Pipes, Washington Report on 
Middle East Affairs, July 2001
Pipes is also the founder of Campus Watch, 
an organization whose critics call a new incar
nation of McCarthyism,where students are 
encouraged to snitch on their teachers who 
may hold unpopular views. This blacklisting is 
encouraged rather than taking up these issues 
with the college in question. Judith Butler, a 
professor at University of California-Berkeley, 
wrote to Pipes in an open letter, saying:
I have recently learned that your organiza
tion is compiling dossiers on professors at US
academic institutions who oppose the Israeli 
occupation and its brutality, actively support 
Palestinian rights for self-determination as 
well as a more informed and intelligent view of 
Islam than is currently represented in the US 
media. I would be enormously honored to. be 
counted among those who actively hold these 
positions and would like to be included in the 
list of those who are struggling for justice.
Under the guise of American patriotism and 
the protection of national interests abroad, 
Pipes encourages the notion that singling out 
Arab and Muslim academics is acceptable, 
encouraged, and a patriotic duty.
When a campus organization sponsors 
speakers and events that showcase racism 
against Arabs, they send a message to the Arab 
community on campus. While freedom of 
speech clearly applies with respect to the legal
ity of the matter, the statement that Carnegie 
Mellon makes with its invitation to Brooks and 
Pipes is still clear  racism against Arabs is 
acceptable.

Youth sour

ELECTION, from page All
Rendells plans for....  or Mike 
Fishers proposal for....  Smearing, 
not debating, is the prevalent form of 
campaigning in this years PA guber
natorial race.
Professor William Keechs 
American Political Institutions course 
deals with the preferences and out
comes of individuals and institutions. 
He says youth are not organized, and 
thus not as powerful as are older gen
erations.
Older people are better organized, 
vote more, and are more united on 
age-related issues. This is one reason 
that far more of the federal budget 
goes to older non-working groups 
than to younger non-working 
groups.
This statement is pertinent, accu
rate, and should disturb youth that 
care about their voices being heard. 
Why are the elderly more organized? 
Why do the elderly vote more? With 
an increasingly older electorate, it is 
imperative that the youth of today j 
steps up, organizes, and makes their 
opinions heard. Otherwise, the skew
ing of American politics to an aging 
electorate will simply cause the cycle 
of youth disinterest to continue and 
expand.
Politicians and foresight are not 
words one would readily associate, let 
alone use together in a sentence. The 
knee-jerk reactions seen after 9-11 are 
a prime example of politicians pan
dering to the now, and ignoring the 
clear and present problems which are 
due to arise in the future. Why is this 
the way? Well, put bluntly, its effec
tive. This trend continues to get 
incumbents reelected and challengers 
into office. That which gets a politi
cian elected today may not be best for 
him or her, nor the country in the 
future. This does not bode well for 
current incumbents and hopeful chal
lengers committed to real solutions.
An elephant, and in this case a donkey 
as well, never forgets. When the youth 
of today does begin to indulge itself in 
political action and in the operation of 
the country, they will remember how 
they were once ignored. For purposes 
of balanced agendas and overall conti
nuity, the persons in power have an 
obligation to come forward and 
encourage youth participation. Those 
in charge need to address issues rele
vant to all voter constituencies or face 
a deterioration of overall electorate 
confidence. And, perhaps, their own 
political demise.

Pro football not quite ready for players to come out of closet
Fromc lroor35C
Its scary. Im not sure how people will 
react, especially the people I competed against 
on the football field. Those were the words 
used by Esera Tuaolo in an article he wrote 
about his decision to come out of the closet.
'He has a partner named Mitchell, two adoptJi,:ed children, and is dabbling in recording his 
6wn music. Nothing special, right?
^rb Wrong. Tuaolo is a special case. Not every 
man who comes out of the closet had an 
' accomplished football career. He played in the 
: Super Bowl with the Atlanta Falcons, he 
splayed in the Pro Bowl, and he gained the 
respect of players like Brett Favre and John 
v1 Randle. Yet he was not like them. Throughout 
' * his nine-year playing career, Tuaolo was torn. 
'y: A 280-pound gladiator was reduced to tears 
ll7;nightly after every game. He had a secret, one 
!H that is still socially unacceptable to reveal, and 
it almost ruined this mans life.
He was on the verge of ruin, sent there by 
the depression and hard liquor combination
that never does anyone any good. He spoke 
often of committing suicide, and claims it was 
only the love for his mother that kept him 
alive all those years he struggled with his true 
identity. He and his partner have lived a lie for 
several years now; Tuaolo was too scared to 
come out. But that has changed now. He has 
changed. The liquor is in the closet that he 
was finally bold enough to step out of, and he 
has finally thrown a tremendous burden off of 
his back.
Tuaolo isnt the only former NFL player to 
come out after his career. The most famous 
case is David Kopay, the first football player to 
reveal his secret to the world. Kopay was a 
running back for nine seasons, and experi
enced much of the torment that Tuaolo spoke 
of. Even though he came out after retirement, 
Kopay felt like an outsider in the NFL. There 
have been other cases of former players com
ing out, but they are few and far between. The 
percentage of gay men in America leads to the 
suspicion that three or four guys on every 
team are gay. Yet that number will never be 
known, as gay men will probably never come
out while they are playing.
The NFL is accepting of homosexuality. 
There are some super-macho guys, some 
young rookies coming fresh out of college, 
and some flat-out jackasses who hate gay 
men. However, for the most part, much of the 
response to Tuaolo has been positive. Publicly, 
the NFL accepts the fact that gay men play 
football at a professional level. However, the 
NFL does not tolerate homosexuality. 
Acceptance is easy; you just shrug and say 
okay. Tolerance, however, requires under
standing, and it requires a true commitment 
to believing that everyone is equal regardless 
of his or her sexual orientation. The NFL does
nt have that. If it did, then players like Tuaolo 
wouldnt spend their career in fear or shame. 
They wouldnt drink themselves into oblivion 
over who they are; they wouldnt contemplate 
suicide.
Personally, I dont think the NFL is ready to 
understand homosexuality. Society is still hav
ing trouble with that part. It is hard to sit back 
and think of all the gay men in the NFL who 
are reduced to tears. It is hard to not be pro
active. But it is harder still to force tolerance 
on people. It is nearly impossible, in fact.
These men who cant tolerate homosexuality 
are not bad people, they are not monsters or 
cruel. They are normal people, and asking 
them to change their beliefs is as ridiculous as 
asking a gay man to go straight. I admire the 
strength of Tuaolo, and those who suffer as he 
did, and a part of me feels sorry for them. But 
I am not an idealist.
I dont believe that tolerating someone is 
easy, that changing who you are to fit your 
world is just that simple. It is hard to tolerate. 
It is hard to understand. Maybe our children 
will have an easier time with it  for the sake 
of men like Tuaolo, I hope so  but for now 
gay men have to keep their secret. The game is 
not ready for a shake-up like that. It is easy to 
accept the fact that a former defensive line
man was gay, and appreciate his strength of 
character. Hopefully, someday it will be just as 
easy to tolerate.

as a rebound from the Spartan 
defense was blocked again, with the 
net empty.
Two major chances evaporated late 
in the second half when junior mid
fielder Anne Talarico missed a shot 
off a cross pass and later when a 
McMorrow shot drew the Case 
Western goalie out of the box. 
Dumont made a play for the rebound 
but ended up tangled with the 
Spartan, and first-year forward 
Kristin Bevilaqua-Linn missed the 
third-chance shot. There were no 
more scores, and the game ended 1-0 
by virtue of the first-half goal.
The game marked seasons end for 
the team, which won three of its final 
four games. The game prior to the 
Case game was a 4-3 win over La 
Roche College on Thursday. If given a 
bid, the team will next play in the 
ECAC tournament, which starts on 
November 13.

The teams will compete in the 
NCAA Regionals at Salisbury 
University on November 16. The 
event qualifies participants for the 
NCAA Championships at St. Olaf 
College on November 23. In the mens 
event, the top three teams and the top 
seven individuals qualify. For women, 
the top two teams and six individuals 
qualify. Aerni believes that both 
teams have potential individual qual
ifiers for the Championships.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 4, 2002
Off-season wheeling and 
dealing gets underway
ulvv \CU(
Its only been a week since the 
World Series ended, but the Major 
League Baseball off-season is 
already in full swing. Since the last 
out of game seven was recorded, 
five teams have named new man
agers.
Add to that the Tigers and 
Rangers, who made their changes 
early in October; the Cubs and 
Mariners, who still have vacancies;
' and possibly the Giants if Dusty 
I- Baker heads to the Cubs; and there 
art could be 10 teams with new man, agers at the start of next year, or a 
third of the league.
Most of these new managers 
(Alan Trammell in Detroit, Ned Yost 
in Milwaukee, and whoever ends up 
in Chicago) wont make a bit of dif
ference in the standings. A few 
could pay off big dividends, espe
cially Buck Showalter coming out of 
the broadcast booth to manage the 
Rangers. Showalter has a proven 
history of building both the most 
recent Yankees dynasty and the 
Diamondbacks team that ended that 
dynasty in 2001.
Unfortunately, his timetable for 
success has been slightly longer 
than that of his owners, so 
Showalter wasnt around for any of 
the championships.
In Texas, Showalter will face his 
greatest challenge yet: build a win
ner out of a team that is more com
mitted to being a laughingstock 
than a winner. If Showalter gets 
some say in which new players the 
Rangers target during this off-season, he may have a chance, but it 
wont be easy. Then again, the 
. Rangers are practically guaranteed 
. a championship as soon aS they fire 
iLIhim.
On the other end of the spec
trum, there are two managerial 
-[>' changes that make absolutely no 
u<u sense from the perspective of the 
new managers.
Consider that Art Howe left a 
team that just won 103 games and 
made the playoffs for three consec
utive years to manage a team that 
finished last in their division 
despite one of the three highest 
. payrolls in the league.
... Clearly, strange forces were at 
work for the Mets, and I think they 
ri- probably all relate to the $9.4 million Howe will make over the next 
four years.
Even more outrageous is the way 
Lou Piniella abandoned Seattle for 
Tampa Bay, of all places, citing a
desire to work closer to home. If 
Piniella really wanted to be closer 
to home, he would have been better 
off retiring than trying to turn 
around a franchise that has never 
Won 70 games in a season. The $13 
million contract that will make 
Piniella the second-highest paid 
manager in the league may have 
had just a little something to do 
with his decision.
On the topic of loyalty versus 
money, the free agency period has 
officially started, with an open bid
ding war between the Indians and 
Phillies for first baseman Jim 
Thome. Bidding war may not be 
exactly the right term, however, 
since the Indians arent willing to 
escalate their initial bid to combat 
the Phillies offer. What the Indians 
are offering, though, is to rename a 
portion of Jacobs Field the Thome 
Terrace, give Thome a spot in the 
front office upon his retirement, 
and basically guarantee his position 
as the most popular player in team 
history.
For their part, the Phillies are 
offering Thome lots and lots of 
money. Though theyre also target
ing third baseman David Bell, sec
ond baseman Jeff Kent (both of the 
Giants), and Braves pitcher Tom 
Glavine.
Any two of the four would proba
bly use up all of the extra cash the 
Phillies have lying around, and as 
much as they want Thome, they are 
more than one power hitter away 
from serious contention.
Amazingly, it might not matter how 
much the Phillies offer, as Thome 
has repeatedly stated that he wants 
to remain in Cleveland and is actu
ally the type of player to do it. 
(Humor me here; this illusion is the 
only way I can deal with the possi
bility of my favorite player skipping 
town.)
The rest of the free agency period 
should be fairly normal, with the 
notable exception that the Yankees 
are vowing to be less active than 
usual in an attempt to avoid as 
much of the recently-implemented 
luxury tax as possible. Not that they 
wont overpay their share of big 
names, but itll be at least one more 
year before Steinbrenner signs 
every available player just because 
he can.

A funny thing happened when I 
came to America, said Koellman. 
When I got here, I weighed about 
180 pounds. Well, by the time I got 
to college, I was more of a football
sized 215. I wouldve needed to get 
myself in much better shape in order 
to play on a soccer team in college 
and contribute a lot.
Originally, Koellman wanted to 
play for an Ivy League school, as 
they were all heavily recruiting him. 
Through the process he discovered 
the dark underside of Division I 
recruiting when he visited the 
University of Pennsylvania. He took 
to the school immediately and tar
geted it as his number one choice, 
and then the football coach told him 
that he was their number one kick
ing prospect and that he was already 
accepted to the University, and that 
he might be accepted into the 
Wharton School of Business.
Excited, he decided he should be 
honest with all the other schools and 
tell them that he was planning on 
going to Penn. Three weeks later, 
however, the counselor called him 
into her office and told him that the 
coach at Penn had found another 
kicker. Because he was so honest, his 
options for school became limited,

and he decided to go for the best 
academic school he was still interest
ed in. Luckily for the Tartans, that 
was Carnegie Mellon.
I came here because it has a great 
business school and because I really 
like the football staff they have 
here, said Koellman. The coach at 
Penn became the most hated man in 
my life, and I got in trouble because 
of my naivete. However, coach 
Lackner was very nice and very hon
est, and I really appreciated that. 
However, he quickly discovered 
that not even coach Lackner could 
be trusted all the time. This sum
mer, joked Koellman, I told coach 
that my number 21 jersey was too 
tight and that Id like a bigger one if 
possible. Coach said Sure, no prob
lem and ended up giving me 93, so 
now Im stuck with a big defensive 
linemans number.
In his first year as a Tartan, he won 
the starting job in training camp, but 
suffered a hamstring pull in the 
opening kickoff of a scrimmage with 
Marietta College and was sidelined 
for four weeks. At that point, the 
coaches decided to red-shirt him as a
freshman and save an extra year of 
eligibility, so his season ended early. 
But now he is healthy enough to play 
and displaying that he has the men
tal toughness to be a kicker.
All kicking is about is being able 
to handle it mentally, said 
Koellman. When you get up there, 
you forget about what happened 
your last kick. You just have to focus 
and block everything out and not get 
too down on yourself.
While he is enjoying the chance to 
play here, he cannot share his 
accomplishments with his friends 
and family back home. His mother is 
a doctor and worries about the phys
ical nature of the sport, while none 
of his friends even understand the 
sport. But then again, neither did he.
It took me eight games into my 
senior year to finally figure out the 
four down system, said Koellman. 
All I knew originally was that even
tually someone would shout Field 
goal and I would go on the field 
with everyone else. So none of my 
friends really even know what Im 
doing. Im pretty much out here on 
my own.
Tartans at the Chicago two-yard line.
They [the defense] did an excel
lent job, Bodnar said. And thats 
what we expect out of them all the 
time.
For Chicago, senior Q.B. Dunn was 
22 for 28, accumulating 239 yards 
and no touchdowns. His main target, 
junior wide receiver Jim Raptis, 
caught 12 passes for 150 yards, giving 
him 64 catches on the year and the 
highest total for any Maroon since 
1969. Chicagos only touchdown 
came with 7:01 left in the fourth qyarter on a 15-yard rush by Sam Owens.
With the win here on Saturday, 
Carnegie Mellon put together their 
first two-game win streak of the sea
son since opening with back-to-back 
victories against Bethany and Grove 
City colleges.
Lackner, with an eye to the future 
and a possible tie for the University 
Athletic Association title, was excited 
about the teams chances to salvage a 
lackluster year.
If we win out, we have a chance to 
tie for the championship in the UAA. 
We havent done that for a couple of 
years, Lackner said. We got a shot.

share of the UAA title by winning 
their first three games. The Tartans 
came off another strong victory on 
the legs of their backup runningbacks in a 27-10 victory over the 
University of Chicago at home.
Watch For: The Wash. U. passing 
attack. Szep also has nine TD pass
es with his 2,112 yards this season, 
and the Tartans defense has trou
ble handling teams that spread Out 
the field. If they can stop the pass, 
then they will have a shot at posi
tioning themselves for a shot of a 
piece of the UAA Championship.
Result: The Tartans will play a 
strong game and keep it close, but 
the Bears match up well against the 
Tartans even though theyve had a 
down year. Expect Szep to have a 
good game and Wash. U. to barely 
hold on to clinch the UAA outright.

Cross country 
women run 
well at UAAs
by Becky Cornelius
Assistant Sports Editor
Carnegie Mellons mens and 
womens cross country teams com
peted in the UAA Championship on 
Saturday, and the team was generally 
happy with the results. The event Was 
hosted by New York University, at Van 
Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.
The womens team placed fifth of 
the eight teams, with a score of 118. 
Senior Kate Aerni, one of the captains 
of the womens team, placed eighth, 
with a time of 23:45.6. Others who 
contributed to the teams score were: 
first-year Drea Garvue in 12th place, 
first-year Nicole Gartner in 22nd, 
senior Susan Pevovar in 34th, and 
first-year Jocelyn Sikora in 45th.
The mens team placed sixth, with 
a score of 110. First-year Dana Irrer 
led the Tartan men once again, plac
ing eighth with an individual time of 
26:13.4. Other placers were: junior 
Matt Meurer in 15th, senior Mike 
Rossi in 23rd, first-year Nick End in 
29th, and junior Patrick Fisher in 
35th.
The overall winner of the mens 
events was the University of Chicago, 
with 47 points. Chicagos Tom Haxton 
had the fastest individual time, at 
25:34.9. Washington University took 
the victory for the womens teams 
overall, also keeping its total down to 
47 points. The fastest individual time 
went to a junior from Brandeis 
University, Mariko Tansey Holbrook, 
who finished in 22:06.8.
Carnegie Mellon runners received 
both the mens and the womens 
awards for Freshman of the Year. Irrer 
took the honors for the men, and 
Garvue for the women.
The women were very satisfied 
with their overall performance.
The UAA is extremely strong when 
it comes to cross country, said Aerni. 
There is a good chance that at least 
three and maybe all four of the teams 
that beat us will qualify for nationals. 
With this perspective, we are really 
happy with the results from the meet, 
especially considering that we were 
last place just last year.
The mens team was not quite as 
happy with its performance.
We were disappointed. We expect
ed to do better, said coach Dario 
Donatelli. He went on to say that a I 
possible reason for the disappoint
ment was that the runners were worn 
out from the previous week, when 
they competed in a very hard race.

Mens soccer finishes undefeated 
season and looks to D-III tourney
Jeff Cullers/Photo Editor
Hallie Dumont clears the ball in the Tartans 4-3 win over La Roche on Thursday.
Women conclude season 
with wins, hope for bid
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
A pair of wins this week closed an 
undefeated season for the 19thranked mens soccer team (16-0, 
7-0 in the UAA). The team, which is 
Division Ills only undefeated team, 
is headed later this month to their 
third consecutive NCAA tourna
ment with the UAA automatic bid.'
Saturdays game versus Case 
Western Reserve (2-14, 0-7 in the 
UAA) featured the teams four 
seniors in their last regular-season 
and home games.
While the games remained closer 
than the Tartans would have liked, 
they broke their own UAA record 
with their tenth shutout this sea
son, versus the six they had in 1999.
The game started quickly with 
three major chances in the first 
three minutes. Case goalkeeper 
John Cheveney stopped two of the 
chances, including a shot from firstyear midfielder Dan Mastalski that 
nearly snuck into the upper right 
corner of the Case Western goal; 
the third was cleared by the Case 
defense.
The next chance for Carnegie 
Mellon came as sophomore mid
fielder James Steidel netted the 
eventual game-winner five minutes 
later. An additional shot by senior 
midfielder Adam Hibshman two 
minutes later bounced into the 
crossbar of the Spartan goal and 
down into the arms of Cheveney.
The game slowed, but the Tartans 
continued to control possession of 
the ball, keeping it in Case Western 
territory most of the remainder of 
the half.
The half s next legitimate scoring 
chance was nullified as a booted 
ball from junior Mike Leonhard was 
caught by the goalie with four min
utes to play. The Tartans held onto a 
tenuous 1-0 lead at the half.
In the second half, the Tartans 
relied on their stellar defense to 
keep CWRU scoreless. Three major 
Carnegie Mellon chances material
ized in the half.
Senior forward Matt Crummy 
blasted a shot that was blocked by 
the Case Western defense at the 
beginning of the half, and a 
Hibshman free kick was saved by 
the Spartans diving goalkeeper.
Between the two chances, junior 
defender Mark Painter fell awk
wardly, injuring his ankle. Painter is 
receiving X-rays today, but will 
most likely be out for the remainder 
of the season.
The last chance in the half for 
Carnegie Mellon to score an insur
ance goal came with less than a 
minute to play as a shot from 
Steidel in the crowd found the back 
of the net.
While the players is pleased with 
their record, they seek improve
ment in the NCAA tournament.
Were not playing to our poten
tial, said senior forward James 
Chung, referring to the teams nar
row margins of victory in the last
five games. The teams only get bet
ter in the playoffs.
On Wednesday, the team faced 
regional rival Washington and 
Jefferson College (10-8-1).
While the Tartans boasted a halftime 3-0 lead on an unassisted hat 
trick from Hibshman, the 
Presidents brought the score to 3-2 
in the second half, before the 
Tartans required a defensive stand 
to prevent a tied-game.
Hibshmans offensive explosion 
in the game was enough, but the 
two goals from Washington and j 
Jefferson worried the teams 
defense. Sophomore keeper Dave 
Thomas made two saves against 
potential game-tying goals in the 
last 25 minutes of the game, sup
ported by defensive play from the 
rest of the team.
When the NCAA tournament 
begins on November 13, the team 
hopes to congeal, further increasing 
its opportunity for a championship. 
Over the next week the coach hopes 
to give his players rest, while 
preparing them for the difficult 
tasks ahead.
in their last two trips to the NCAA 
tournament, the Tartans have fallen 
to the Messiah College Falcons. Two 
years ago the Tartans lost in the 
first round, 4-0. Last season CMU 
won one game, its first ever win in 
an NCAA tournament, and lost to 
the Falcons on penalty kicks in their 
second tournament game.
Final tournament schedules will 
be released later this week.

Staffwriter
The Tartan women closed the year 
with a pair of victories against UAA 
rival Case Western Reserve University 
and Pittsburgh rival La Roche College. 
The team (11-4-2,2-3-2 in the UAA) 
may be eligible for an Eastern College 
Athletic Conference (ECAC) tourna
ment bid this year.
Sundays game pitted the women 
against Case Western (11-6-2,1-6-0 
in the UAA). The team started press
ing the CWRU defense quickly, with a 
corner kick in the first minute of play; 
the kick never entered play and hit 
the left side of the Case Western goal.
Senior midfielder Melissa 
McMorrow missed another opportu
nity when her free kick from 12 yards
away from the goal failed to pene
trate the Case defense. Two further 
shots were denied by the defense in 
the 11th minute, but junior midfield
er Merry McConnochie took the ball 
from first-year forward Hallie 
Dumont and opened the games scor
ing, putting the Tartans ahead, 1-0.
The remainder of the half was 
marked by missed chances for both 
teams, but mostly Carnegie Mellon, 
who was unable to score, despite con
trolling the ball in Case territory.
The second half started with a near 
disaster as a Tartan pass was blocked 
by Case Western midfielder Beth 
Stepanczuk and taken around the 
only defender in her way en route to 
missing her shot.

Tartans7 kicker 
finds his place in 
American football
Another week, another chance to redress mistakes and 
finish the year on a high note for the Tartans;
This is a two-week season right now. We have two 
weeks to go. We just need everyones concentration and 
focus ... and well go out there and give a great effort. 
This from head football coach Richard Lackner on 
Saturday, as his football team posted a convincing win 
over the University of Chicago Maroons at home. The 
Tartans (5-3, 1-1) defeated Chicago (3-5,1-2) 27-10 in 
a game that was more lopsided than even the 17-point 
difference would indicate. Brad Stanley continued his 
productive ways rushing the ball for CMU, collecting 105 
yards and three touchdowns en route to the Maroon dis
mantling. His counterpart for most of the afternoon, 
sophomore Ryan Neupaver, finished with 88 yards and 
added one touchdown, including a nifty 29-yard scamper 
through a sieve-like Chicago defense.
A productive day for the Tartans began with Stanleys 
two-yard dive into the endzone with 1:29 left in the first 
quarter, capping a 35-yard drive on nine plays for 
Carnegie Mellon. Earlier in the quarter, Neupaver, with a 
quick first step that plagued the Chicago defense all after
noon, beat them for 13 yards on a nice run up the middle. 
The running back picked up where he left off in the sec
ond quarter, when he scored his first TD of the game with 
9:14 remaining in the half, again on a 13-yard gallop. A 
blocked extra point from kicker Ben Koellmann left the 
score at 13-0 for the remainder of the half.
As much as the offensive display delighted the Parents
by Tristan Hoffman
Contiibuting Editor
Every time Benjamin Koellman attempts a field 
goal during the football teams practices, he must 
put up with hearing offensive coordinator Rich 
Erdelyi trying to distract him by screaming Kraut, 
the nickname bestowed upon him by the coach. But 
this is just another df.y in the life of the Tartan placekicker who grew up playing soccer in a German vil
lage so small that his phone number was simply 860.
Koellman, a sophomore business major, has been 
overcoming adversity in battling injuries and adjust
ing to the game ever since he came to America as an 
exchange student in September of 1999. His latest 
battle has been with a stress fracture in his lower ver
tebrae, but two weeks ago at Rose-Hulman he was 
cleared to play for the first time since the injury 
occurred in training camp, when he was battling 
junior Michael Palmer for the starting job. In his 
debut as the Tartan kicker, he was two for two.
Koellmans kicking career began at the age of 
three, but as a soccer player. He played soccer all of 
his life in Germany, and then as a junior he came 
over to the states to the Ft. Lauderdale area to go to 
a boarding school. There he played soccer during the 
spring, and the football coach scouted him and 
decided hed make a good kicker.
Everyone was telling me that I would make a 
great field-goal kicker, said Koellman. All the 
teams wanted foreigners kicking for them, and this 
was when [Polish kicker] Sebastian Janikowski was

The mens swim team continued its 
unbeaten start this past Saturday at 
the University Center swimming 
pools, but the womens team suffered 
its first loss of the year. Both teams 
faced off with Clarion University. The 
men won their meet 173-118, while 
the womens team lost 208-91.
The match started with Clarions 
women A and B relay teams taking 
first and second in the 200-yard med
ley relay, a fortuitous beginning that 
set the tone for the rest of the 
womens matches. The women ended 
up finishing first in only two events, 
with junior Corey Ginsberg winning 
the 200-yard breaststroke (2:32.95), 
and sophomore Mindi Finnegan win
ning the 3-meter diving with a score 
of 225.45. Otherwise, it was all 
Clarion, led by a strong performance 
by senior Abby Koch and Megan
Trimbur, each of whom won two 
events.
As for the men, they continue to be 
dominant, led by the strong perfor
mances of the last two UAA swim
mers of the year, junior Brian 
McCarthy and sophomore Chris 
Pearson. Both swimmers each won 
three events, with McCarthy captur
ing the 400-yard IM (4:13.96), the 
200-yard backstroke (1:56.69), and 
the 100-yard backstroke (52.91s). 
Pearson won the 500-yard freestlye 
(4:39.42), the 200-yard freestyle 
(1:41.08), and the 1,000-yard 
freestyle (9:52.35). Junior Brian 
Jucha won the 100-yard butterfly 
(51.36s) and the 100-yard freestyle 
(47.62s), and first-year Brian Hunter 
continued his strong start by winning 
the 200-yard breaststroke (2:11.34).
Both teams are preparing to open 
UAA competition at the Emory 
University Invitational meet, which 
will be held at Emory on November 9 
through November 10.The Tartan men defeated Clarion University on Saturday, winning their meet 173-118.
Brad Stanley, who romped for three touchdowns in the Tartans win over Chicago, evades defenders on one of his carries. 
Stanley rushed for 105 yards and was a major catalyst in the Tartans victory.
Weekend crowd at Gesling Stadium on Saturday, the 
Tartan defense quickly became the highlight of the con
test. The University of Chicago offense, entering the game 
ranked 16th in passing and 25th in scoring, was kept at 
bay throughout the afternoon. Through a combination of 
interceptions, fumble recoveries, and tenacious play, 
Carnegie Mellon produced, if not its most prolific defen
sive game of the year, than'arguably its most exciting.
We did get a couple of timely picks today, said 
Lackner. [Junior defensive back Joe Ciccarelli] stripped 
the ball down at the goal line after a great punt by Laird 
Stabler. I thought it was a great, great play and I think it 
gave us some cushion.
Ciccarelli provided further cushion for the Tartans 
throughout the day. His leaping snare of Maroon quarter
back Josh Dunns pass in the third quarter at the Tartan 
two-yard line iced an early Chicago drive in the second 
half. The defensive back also contributed three tackles.
Creating and recovering fumbles also played a healthy 
role in the success of defensive coordinator Terry 
Bodnars impressive squad Saturday. In the first quarter, 
defensive back Ryan McMillen partially blocked a Maroon 
punt with 20 seconds remaining. McMillen again made 
his presence felt in the fourth quarter, when the senior 
recovered a flubbed punt attempt-cum-fumble on the 
Chicago 27-yard line. The Tartans recovered two more 
Maroon fumbles; in the second quarter by linebacker 
Richard Gasperini and in the third quarter by a number of

On the road with MTV
Dana Vinson won a Spin contest and headed out on tour with Papa Roach
When Dana Vinson first read that Spin Magazine 
and MTV were looking for young writers to submit 
500-word essays about their favorite bands, she did 
what most people do when we read about contests: 
she turned the page. It wasnt until two hours before 
the 5 pm deadline that she actually decided to give 
the contest a shot. She came up with a funny essay 
asking the lead singer of Weezer to shave his beard 
off, and apparently Spin liked it. I honestly didnt 
think I had a chance at winning, but I thought my 
entry would have been good for a laugh up there at 
Spin, Vinson said. I guess they liked it, because a 
few weeks later I got home from work and my mom 
was like, Hey, did you call the guy about the Spin 
thing back? and I said, What Spin thing? because I 
had completely dismissed my chances of winning and 
she replied, The MTV guy.
The winner of the contest got to spend three days 
on tour with Papa Roach and the Anger Management 
Tour, and have it all filmed. Since the show is going to 
be aired on MTV, Vinson had to prove that she could 
do more than just write well. She had to interview the 
editor-in-chief of Spin and an executive from MTV 
over the phone, and then mail a tape of the interview 
to MTV. According to Vinson the interview wasnt as 
scandalous as she expected. I felt like I was audition
ing for the Real World and we should have been talk
ing about if I had a tendency to launch silverware at 
people or have sex with my room
mates, but instead we chatted 
about Neil Diamond and how I 
write stories about robot mon
keys taking over the world.
A month later a camera crew 
for MTV came to Vinsons house. 
She was told that she was one of 
four finalists, and that they just 
wanted to shoot some footage of 
her home. It came as an utter and 
complete shock when two hours 
into the filming she received a 
call from the editor-in-chief of 
Spin, Sia Michel, telling her that 
shed actually won, and had half 
an hour to pack before leaving for 
Phoenix, Arizona, where shed 
meet the band. I was out of my 
mind with excitement at first. I 
did the whole sticking tongue 
out, metal sign into the camera 
gig  it was all very TRL.
After getting a new Ibook and 
Ipod (an mp3 player), and a host 
of other gifts from MTV, Vinson 
hopped on the tour bus that 
would take her from Phoenix, to 
Albuquerque, and then to Denver 
before she headed back home to 
Ohio. I was so nervous about 
meeting these guys, because I 
wanted to get along with them,
but I didnt know if they were going to want to get 
along with me. I was almost shocked by how nice they 
all were  and genuinely too. Even when the cam
eras were off, they asked me where I was from, what 
kind of music I listened to and joked around with
"I did ... the whole 
metal sign into the 
camera  it was all 
very TRL.
n
As for what actually happened while Vinson was on 
tour  well, youll just have to watch and find out. 
MTV caught her and the band doing everything from 
nursing hangovers to playing Cranium. And of 
course, what would a show on MTV be like without 
someone breaking down and crying? Despite her 
tears, Vinson says that going on tour with and inter
viewing Papa Roach was incredible. It was the best 
week of my life and the whole experience has taken 
my life in a much more positive direction.

The Carnegie Tech radio club announced that major technological 
advances were underway for transmitting radio signals. Due to the suc
cess of contacting hams in America and overseas, the club stated that its 
transmitters on bands throughout the VHF, UHF, and super high fre
quency areas [were] now either working or nearing completion. As a 
result of these developments, the club began to teach its students Morse 
Code at a whopping five word per minute transmission rate.

Robert Page, head of the Music Department, officially cancelled the 
Music Education option. The degree offered an undergrad major in 
Performance and Education. Page believed the Education option did not 
meet with the philosophy of the school, and so decided to focus on per
formance in hopes that CMU would compare to other fine, perform
ance-oriented schools. In addition, Page wanted to do away with the 
Kiltie Band, since to him a band was merely a teacher education tool.

In promotion of their album Mondo Bizarro, which Joey Ramone 
billed the best Ramones album ever, The Ramones headlined a show 
in CMUs Skibo Ballroom alongside Social Distortion and Overwhelming 
Colorfast. The Ramones and Social Distortion alone played for two and 
a half hours to a crowd of 1,200. Student tickets sold for $1.

Wean Hall blew up. While five workers were repairing the roof, a 
torch managed to come into contact with a propane tank. Onlookers 
reported that billows and flames could be seen from Forbes Avenue. 
Classes were ended early and the entire building was evacuated. Many 
students in the building were unaware of the explosion, apparentiy 
because of Weans poor alarm system. Two workers received seconddegree burns.
JL year ago, November 5, 2001
Following the patriotic upsurge of 9-11, CMU jumped on the band
wagon by establishing a Security of Technology Office to aid the US gov
ernment in national protection. Members of the Office included CMU 
faculty skilled in different areas of security  robotics, computer securi
ty, risk analysis, etc. Among other research, the new organization 
planned to begin immediate work on bioterrorist attack simulation. 
According to the head of the Office (previously a director of electronic 
technology for the Pentagons defense agency), the time was ripe for 
CMU to give something back to the government  a token of appreci
ation in response to years of federal funding. Originally, the creation of 
a full national security research institute at CMU was proposed, but offi
cials argued that it could possibly serve as a terrorist hot spot and thus 
endanger campus inhabitants.

Take the cannoli, please! 
Vendetta Dolci misses the point
William H. Seward was generally regarded as a 
reasonable man. At all events this Secretary of 
State for Abraham Lincoln was even-tempered and 
sober in the midst of several historical earthquakes. 
As a New York Whig Seward championed various 
noble causes such as prison reform, better public 
education, and immigrant schooling, even as his 
moribund party bid a premature exit. He urged 
Lincoln to abandon Sumter lest the border states 
congeal with the rest of secessionist South creating 
a schism within the Union that could only be over
come with force; a civil war. Hawks meanwhile 
shouted for a federal show of force to crush the 
South Carolinian rebs, with the remaining irreden
ta to follow in short order. In the war, Seward, 
chaste as ever, silenced talk of attacking 
Continental Europe should the English or French 
offer arms to the South through his calm diploma
cy and schoolboy charm. Neither France nor 
England ever made an appearance, thanks to 
Secretary Seward.
But of course you know none of this. No, if you 
claim at least a working knowledge of American 
history (and, to be sure, your ranks are thinning) 
you remember William H. Seward for one thing. 
Sewards Folly, Sewards Icebox  whatever 
the title, Seward is recalled (ridiculed?) for his cav
alier approach in playing capture-the-flag with the 
Russians. Alaska was annexed, but the Reasonable 
Mr. Seward had been undone by one conviction 
that trumped considerations of fame, power, and 
friendship.
The point? Even rational, ordinary folk such as 
your intrepid reviewer can become caterwauling 
idealists or stubborn reactionaries on certain 
issues. So, at the risk of losing friend and reader 
alike, herewith the chestnut of this exercise: Italian 
food should not be mucked with. And Pittsburgh 
seems not to have been alerted to this small but 
indissoluble maxim. Furthermore, Vendetta Dolci, 
spirited away to a corner somewhere on the South 
Sides S. 23rd Street, offers little to nudge this crit
ic from his stance.
Dolci has a number of problems. First, there is an 
appendage named Jeromes grafted to its main din
ing area which bills itself as a bar of sorts. No prob
lem here; there are plenty of restaurant/bars, 
right? Yes, but since Dolci was purchased from 
Jeromes proprietor, there is visible evidence to 
indicate that the restaurant is the Johannes Faustus 
of this tragedy  in exchange for its eating space, 
Vendetta Dolci has become a mere anteroom to the 
bacchanalia which goes on in the much bigger (and 
more crowded) Jeromes. Without some sort of
divider  a door, sliding panel, chicken wire, 
something  the food at Dolci constantly plays second-fiddle to the boozing taking place ten paces 
hence.
Second, the dcor is just ugly.
Third, the wine list (or lack thereof) 
boasts by a generous count about 
three Italian varietals, total. One of 
them, Pinot Grigio, should 
fail to count since any 
menu anywhere worth 
its tannin should have 
this white.
Lastly  and as 
a bone of con
tention, here 
there is enough to 
fill several ossuaries
 the food at 
Vendetta Dolci isnt 
worth your time or 
money. Some 
entrees, particular
ly the vitello, are ten
derized  steam-pressed, really  to 
the point where the medallions on ones 
plate resemble in thickness the pennies that alone 
will occupy ones pockets after financing this half
hearted attempt at mediocrity. Perhaps a bit meanspirited, that, but $18 for two French pancakes 
masquerading as veal cudets does not haute cui
sine make. Fish makes an appearance only briefly, 
and the menu offerings dont feature the heavy-hitters (cod, smelt, squid) in very many dishes, and 
sometimes not at all. Salads are decent but change 
little from one selection to the next, obviating the 
need to try the caesar when your house already 
involves pretty much the same stuff. As for 
desserts, the peanut butter chocolate cheesecake 
(yes, its as heavy as it sounds) is a safe bet, but only 
because the others (no tiramisu!) are so unappeal
ing.
Is there a bright spot to all this gloom, 
Pascocello? Yes. Its to be found at that tranquil 
moment when, upon exiting the restaurant, you 
overhear a tte--tte about how He likes the food 
so and She agrees completely, because its just like 
the Olive Garden, dear! At this you walk out into 
the bitter autumn night, always alone, safe in the 
knowledge that youll recover some small victory of 
principle like Sewards; if not this day, then soon.

Surreal art at the Wood Street Galleries
Five international artists photo manipulations
Courtesy of Patricia Piccinini
For Real, an art exhibit at the Wood Street Galleries, challenges reality 
using digital software. Murray Horne, curator of Wood Street Galleries, 
first conceived the exhibits theme after viewing Timothy Hutchings 
The Arsenal at Danzig and Other Views.
Hutchings work is composed of photographs of architectural land
marks that were destroyed in World War II. By inserting other images into 
the pictures, such as a bicyclist and a tourist, he has taken a past event 
and added anachronisitic, with clues to their artificiality.
It triggered an idea, like a seed, said Horne.
After seeing the merit in Hutchings work, Horne began looking for 
artists who focused on a similar theme, and assembled a collection of 
diverse artists. In addition to Hutchings, a New Yorker, the exhibit 
includes work by Australian artist Patricia Piccinini, Canadian artist Euan 
Macdonald, Dutch artist Margi Geerlinks, and Amir Zaki, from Los 
Angeles.
Piccininis work focuses on the current trend of genetic modification in 
biotechnology, as in S02 (or Synthetic Organism 2), which is a hybrid 
of a platypus and a salamander.
She is one of very few artists dealing with [the issue] very directly, 
said Horne.
Her work also includes Breathing Room, which targets both the view
ers aural and visual senses. The sound of rhythmic breathing meets the 
observer before entering a room with three large screens seeming to 
depict skin.
Macdonalds video projections also bring in the idea of illusion, but use 
banal objects to a humorous end, as in Hammock Sleep.
In Geerlinks work Crafting Humanity, digital software is the medium 
for historical irony. She takes a traditional Dutch art image, an elderly 
lady doing needlework, and reverses it so that a young boy is being 
stitched by his father.
Zakis photographs of city skylines cast doubt on aspects of a print that 
are normally assumed, such as the location, scale, perspective, and time 
of day of each scene.

Swami Bodhananda
Explaining ecstasy: part of the International FestivalMajor Jackson
Visiting Philadephia poet to read at CMU next week
The advertised title of Swami 
Bodhananda Saraswatis lecture this past 
Tuesday, Ecstasy in Everyday Life, was 
the most tantalizing phrase to appear 
recently on the schools many bulletin 
boards. Those who responded to its call 
were rewarded by a lively lecture.
Dressed in glowing orange, his feet 
swaying to the rhythm of his speech, 
Swami Bodhananda explained how people 
seek happiness outside themselves and fail 
to find it, then offered an alternative: 
There is no special act to get ecstasy. 
Change your attitude during your usual 
activity; keep your mind quiet and obser
vant. When actively, dynamically involved 
in the moment, you have no thoughts of 
past and future. This is natural happiness.
Swami Bodhananda, born in Mattatur, 
Kerala, in India, felt a spiritual calling at an 
early age. He left his post-graduate studies 
to wander the Himalayas (an idea that 
always sounds appealing around 
midterms) and later joined an ancient 
order devoted to the study of Advaita 
Vedanta (ancient Indian scripts). Today he 
is a respected teacher of the Vedanta tradi
tion, the founder of The Sambodh Society
Do, become and see, said Houston 
Smith, keynote speaker of the 
International Festival 2002. His exuberant 
voice pulsed through the speakers out into 
the audience. Smith holds 11 honorary 
degrees, and has written 12 books and 
over 70 articles in professional and popu
lar journals. He is an accomplished reli
gious historian and philosopher, to say the 
least.
His true passion unfolded as he began 
his lecture Enduring Truths of The Great 
Religions. Rather than work, Smith 
described this lecture as pleasure and 
then convinced the audience why that was 
an accurate portrayal.
Smith broke down a question everyone 
has pondered at one time  what is ones 
purpose in life? There are three things in 
life: What should we do? What kind of 
people should we become? And what do 
we see (in regards to the big picture)? 
Smith said, referring to ethics, the virtues 
one should try to have, and the larger pic(a religious organization for education 
about Indias spiritual heritage), and the 
author of several books, including 
Meditation: The Awakening of Inner Powers, 
and his most recent publication, Self 
Unfoldment in an Interactive World.
The keen wit of Swami Bodhananda, 
and his ability to rapidly adapt Vedantic 
wisdom to modern concerns, were espe
cially apparent during the question-andanswer hour following his lecture. To such 
difficult questions as, Whats the value of 
working a job and having a family if happi
ness is our natural state? he gave satisfy
ing answers: When you live from natural 
happiness, you become a creative force. 
Love is the expression of the fullness of the 
happiness within yourself, otherwise there 
is no loving, but simply demanding.
After Tuesdays lecture, it was easy to 
agree with Swami Bodhananda that medi
tation is a necessary life skill that should be 
taught in all universities. Students at 
Carnegie Mellon could especially use a lit
tle inner peace.

ture at play.
With a back
ground of the 
basic precepts 
of life in place,
Smith devel
oped his argu
ments of how 
the great reli
gions overlap 
and how their 
shared values 
cultivate these JeW Cullers/Photo Editor
concepts. Huston Smith
Sciences spectrum of knowledge seems 
to be unending while religions seems to be 
finite. Smith wholeheartedly disagrees. To 
conclude his discussion Smith said, The 
religions say unanimously that the vertical 
line which monitors meaning, value, supe
rior and inferior is as long as the sciences 
horizontal line of spatial relations.
As part of the Adamson Writers Series, Major 
Jackson, author of Leaving Saturn, will be read
ing on Wednesday, November 6. Leaving 
Saturn, winner of the 2000 Cave Canem prize 
for best first book by an African-American poet, 
is a cosmic blend of Jacksons Philadelphian 
adolescence and the jazz/disco club scene in 
which he grew up.
Jackson uses very specific word choice in his 
poetry. His sentences serve as minute flashes of 
his past that are compiled to create a larger pic
ture of what was going on at that time. In Mr. 
Pates Barbershop Jacksons lyrical verses tell 
the story of growing up during a time when 
street wars were taking away the youth of the 
community. He tells this account while he sits in 
the barbershop chair, comparing the barber to
Closets are
Coming out stories wrap up Gay
Imagine being met with one of these state
ments from your father after coming out as 
gay or bisexual: Id love you even if you were 
Republican or Just dont let it get in the way 
of your academics. Would you laugh or cry?
Bryce, a graduate student in statistics, said 
his father told him the first. Bryce requested 
that his last name not be printed.
It really mattered to him so litde that it 
upset me.
Simon Li, a sophomore information systems 
major, president of cmuOUT and an outreach 
officer of ALLIES, felt the same way about his 
dads appeal for academics. After struggling 
over the secret so long, Li felt offended that his 
father hadnt taken more of an interest in 
something so important to him.
In fact, the consensus at Wednesdays 
Closets are for Clothes, Coming Out Stories, 
was that parents are the hardest people to tell 
that youre gay or bisexual. Ron Ophir, a GSIA 
doctoral student and SoHo coordinator, said 
that he didnt tell his parents until he was near
ly 30. What wouldve happened if I had come 
out when I was 16? he wondered aloud.
Some people cringed to remember their 
experiences coming out. Li said that he came 
out in his high school English class. In the mid
dle of studying about Greek mythology, a stu
dent made a disparaging remark about 
Matthew Shephard, a gay student at the 
University of Wyoming who died after being
an antique dealer, collecting hair as if it were 
gold dust, growing tired, but never forget
ting/someone has to cherish these tiny little 
heads.
Jackson, a professor of English at the 
University of Vermont, has been the recipient of 
fellowships Bread Loaf Conference, Pew 
Fellowship in the Arts and Provincetown Fine 
Arts Work Center and is a member of the Dark 
Room Collective, a reading series in 
Cambridge. His work has appeared in various 
literary journals including The New Yorker, 
American Poetry Review, Post Road, Boulevard, 
and Callaloo.

chained to a fence and tormented. Angered at 
the comment, Li announced that he was 
homosexual, and news spread throughout the 
day. Li, who was then only 5'6" and 96 pounds
 an easy target  was verbally abused in the 
rest of his classes. People physically teased and 
poked him for the 75-minute bus ride home.
NYC has to be one of the most liberal places 
in the country. I thought it would be okay, Li 
said. But he was afraid to bring the issue to the 
administration, in fear that they would tell his 
parents. I was in extreme hell, he said.
Karin Burns, a first-year in H&SS and vice 
president of cmuOUT and member of ALLIES, 
said that her brother was the hardest one to 
tell. He ran out of the room screaming, No, it 
cant be!  she said. Luckily, hes become much 
more accepting in the past four years.
The participants discussed the weight of 
societal pressure versus the difficulty of keep
ing a secret. Matt, who requested that his last 
name not be printed, likened staying closeted 
to being forced to constantly hide an apple 
from the world.
You have to exert all this energy to hide it, 
he said. Sometimes youre sort of forced into 
[coming out] unless you want to pretend.
Vijay Jesrani, a first-year in H&SS, treasurer 
of cmuOUT, and social chair of ALLIES, 
agreed: Its not a secret; its a lie.

Squonk Opera
Off-Broadway performance art
Squonk Opera still puts on a shocking and 
shivery show  even more shocking, given its 
stint on Broadway, is the companys loyalty to 
the Burgh.
Squonks first big hit to be recognized else
where (with, among other accolades, the 2000 
American Theatre Wing Design Award), 
Bigsmorgasbordwiinderwerk enjoyed a quick 
stint Off-Broadway, then leapt to Broadway in 
March 2000 for an even shorter run, allowing 
just enough time for the New York avant-garde 
theater scene to wonder what hit it.
The show, which has been in continual devel
opment since then, was first performed five 
years ago here in Pittsburgh, through the gen
erosity of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. CMU 
alum Steve OHearn (Squonks visual effects 
master) and local staple Jackie Dempsey 
(Squonks composer and musical director) work 
better together now than ever, bringing a 
stronger sense of the companys identity to bear. 
The piece has improved with age, balancing its 
kooky effects and jumbled narrative with a 
stronger sense of progression and purpose.
Squonks specialty is creating a virtual world

Mayurs Milan
The annual Indian cultural event
Milan, the Hindi word for coming together, is also 
the name of Mayurs seventh annual cultural show. 
This years event, scheduled for Friday, November 8, 
aims to bring a new perspective of the South Asian cul
ture to the rest of Carnegie Mellon.
The events co-producer, Ankur K. Datta, a senior 
business administration and economics major, 
describes the show as trying to present the vast and 
diverse artistic wonder and beauty of South Asia into 
one grand, onstage spectacle, giving the audience a 
true sense of the subcontinents rich culture and her
itage.
Preparations began a year ago for this event of con
siderable grandeur and magnitude, which in the past 
has attracted audiences of over 400. At the end of last 
semester, Datta and his partner, Minahil Ismail, a sen
ior in English and economics, were elected by other 
members of Mayur to serve as producers for the show.
From that point, Datta explains, we have worked 
direcdy with students and the administration to organ
ize and implement the best cultural show possible.
Both producers have been working hard to bring 
together talented and dedicated individuals who would 
be willing to devote their time to make this upcoming 
show a success. Milan will consist of an array of 17 
individual acts, ranging from dances to song numbers 
to a two-part fashion show. Over 100 students are par
ticipating both on stage and behind the scenes to bring 
Mayurs creation to life.
This show promises to be a great opportunity to 
learn more about South Asian culture and meet new 
people who may have a different perspective on life.

Jam 4 Justice
Amnesty Internationals annual fundraiser 
included art auctions and garnered $160.
A legal Ethiopian emigrant, Getu Berhanu Tewolde, was 
detained by the City of Pittsburgh on charges of making terror
ist threats, causing and risking a catastrophe, and aggravated 
and simple assault in post-September 11 hysteria on February 
1, 2002. Tewolde was imprisoned and forced to take unneces
sary psychiatric medication. After being cleared by the FBI, city 
officials continued to hold Tewolde without privilege to appro
priate legal counsel. Joining the Getu Coalition, Amnesty 
International feels that all charges should be dropped and 
Tewolde should be given a lawyer and due process of law.
Amnesty Internationals Jam 4 Justice held on October 30 in 
Skibo Coffeehouse aimed to raise funds for the Free Getu cam
paign.
Skibo was filled with people writing letters to the political 
leaders of countries where four individuals have all been 
imprisoned unjustly for their race, religion, or political inter
est. Participants also enjoyed free coffee and cookies, and lis
tened to others sharing their concerns. Poetry readings and 
political dissertations highlighted the beliefs of sympathizers.
But the letter writing campaign was a secondary cause to 
this years Jam 4 Justice, said Amnesty co-president Aseem 
Garg, a fifth-year SDS major. The main goal was to raise 
enough money (approximately $300) to cover the remaining 
legal fees for Tewolde.
Starting the night was a didgeridoo performance by senior 
art major Julia Mazzeo, and then local band Carrion Luggage 
played. With a rousing performance lead singer Davin Wang, 
senior mechanical engineering major, proved his love for polit
ical activism. Shortly after his performance, he said, Save the 
manatees, save the world.
Among the other entertainment for the night, Michael 
Croland and the Vegetarian Choir rocked out to various politi
cal themes including, but not limited to, the plight of Native 
Americans and pudge rockers. Pudge rockers, Croland 
explains, are obese musicians who attain their celebrity status 
by meat-eating.
Intermittent between performances was the main fundrais
ing event, a student-work art auction.
Art auctions are our primary fundraisers throughout the 
year. This years main focuses include AIDS in China and fund
ing Getus legal costs, said first-year biology major and 
Amnesty International member Carlie Hosnedl. Amnesty succeededl in raising $160.

The proud return of Grand Buffet
Half their time is spent touring, but they come back to Pittsburgh for the CD release.
Laid-back hip-hop rhyme attack Grand Buffet returns at 
long last from a grueling tour schedule to celebrate their 
third release, Cigarette Beach. Clocking in at just under 25 
minutes, the album is, as per traditional Grand Buffet style, 
bizarre and wonderful.
The chorus of the first track explicitly encourages listen
ers to pick up addictive habits (start smoking, oh yeah), 
but by the second track, Grape-a-don and Lord Grunge 
have reconciled their illicit practices: I dont wanna end up 
on Batmans shit list so I dont shoplift as much as I want 
to.
One cant help but wonder about the numerous refer
ences to Batman throughout the album  at one point, the 
two members of the self-proclaimed Worlds First Rock 
Band launch into discussion about actually removing some 
instances of Batman in the lyrics, but settle on liking the 
caped superhero enough to leave him in. Is this the influ
ence of a long tour with schizo rock star Wesley Willis? Its 
not, says Lord Grunge, though touring with Willis was 
affecting.
He taught us a lot about life, and about music. Hes one 
of the most talented and inspiring people Ive ever met. We 
like him a lot like a hot dog, said Grunge.
After being on the road for six of the last 10 months, 
Grand Buffet plans to begin tour only a month after 
Cigarette Beach drops. The duo spends very little time in 
Pittsburgh, and is excited for the release show.
We havent done an all-ages show in Pittsburgh in over a 
year, so were really psyched to be back. I just hope there 
are still cats in Pittsburgh who still like us, says Grunge, 
but not to worry. With songs like Oh My God Youre Weird 
 the gem of the album  even if the Buffet doesnt play 
any old material, the show should be a good time.
In fact, Grunge says, This show is going to be incredible. 
Even if you fucking hate Grand Buffet, youre an idiot if you 
dont come out, singing the praises of the other perform
ers. Fridays bill also features highly special guests Sage 
Francis (hip-hop from Providence, Rhode Island); Sole 
(California hip-hop); Pittsburghs own international twoman rock celebrities The Modey Lemon; and Columbus, 
Ohio electronic artists The Evolution Control Committee.

A-SIDE: EminemB-SIDE: Vance Gilbert
Can a white male become a successful rapper? Is it possible for a black man to establish 
himself as a reputable folk singer? The Mix Tape investigates the effects of race in music.
Eminem faced two major obstacles as an 
aspiring rapper: race and credibility.
Before settling in Detroit at the age of 
twelve, Marshall Mathers (Eminem) and 
his mother stayed with relatives wherever 
they could for any length of time. In ninth 
grade, Mathers dropped out of school and 
was consumed by Detroits prevalent under
ground hip-hop culture. His unique rhyme 
schemes and word choices won him the 
Wake Up Shows Freestyle Performer of the 
Year and placed him second in the Los 
Angeles Rap Olympics. His talent did not go 
unnoticed by the mainstream. He was taken 
under the wing of rap/production icon Dr. 
Dre and in 1999, released his first fulllength album, tided after his alter ego, Slim 
Shady.
More controversial than his race, howev
er, was the lyrical content of that album and 
its successor, The Marshall Mathers LP. With 
songs that dealt with fantasizing about the 
murder of his babys mother, Eminem was 
often found defending his lyrics in the press. 
Im not alone in feeling the way I feel, he 
said. I believe that a lot of people can relate 
to my shit  whether white, black, it does
nt matter. Everybody has been through 
some shit, whether its drastic or not so dras
tic.
Eminems acclaimed endorsement and 
abrasive lyrics were not the only things that 
gained him publicity. He received more neg
ative publicity when a brawl with his exwifes lover turned ugly and Eminem pistolwhipped the man. The commercial nature 
of his first single, My Name Is, led to air
time on MTV, rap, and rock radio stations 
across the country. This single appealed to 
the MTV audience because of the videos 
comedic style. Rap listeners were attracted 
by its innovative rhymes. Lastly, Eminems 
race provided him the opportunity to reach 
rock radio listen
ers, a group 
generally 
untouched by 
the majority 
of main
stream rap.
Im white 
in a music 
started by 
black people.
Im not igno
rant to the 
culture and 
Im not trying 
to take any
thing away 
from [it],
Eminem said,
but no one has a choice 
where they grew up or what color 
they are. While his race may have initially 
impeded his ability to be taken seriously in 
the hip-hop world, in the end it has helped 
him reach a broader audience.

Vance Gilberts explosion into the 
folk scene was met with rave reviews by 
the genres critics and fans [of the 
musical type alike]. Phrases such as 
spellbinding live show, deliriously 
virtuosic singing, and undeniably 
expressive find their way into reviews 
of his performances on a regular basis. 
Gilbert was quickly successful 
and skirted the 
issues of 
race and
potential hur
dles which could have handicapped his 
career.
Gilbert wasnt particularly interested 
in music for the first several decades of 
his life. Born in Philadelphia, Gilbert 
decided to attend Connecticut College, 
where he first learned to play the bass 
and then the acoustic guitar. The art 
thing hit when I got into college, 
Gilbert said. I said, You know, pick up
a guitar and see what happens. It was
nt til sophomore year.  After graduat
ing in 1979, he moved to Boston and 
began to play a mix of jazz and top 40 
hits in local coffee shops and lounges. 
When he happened to catch one of 
Shawn Colvins shows, Gilbert decided 
to focus on creating folk music as a 
career.
Despite being black in the whitedominated folk scene, Gilberts popu
larity soared almost instantaneously. 
The fact that hes one of a very small 
population of black folk singer/song
writers never feemed to hinder him 
from selling out shows. In both inter
views and album reviews, his race has 
been a minor detail. Instead, its 
Gilberts pure talent that garners atten
tion. His influences, which range from 
Stevie Wonder to Roberta Flack, in 
combination with his uniquely capti
vating voice, keep audiences rapt.
In retrospect, the two hurdles Gilbert 
faced were not obstacles at all; they 
were merely stepping-stones to his suc
cess. Gilberts race has rarely come into 
play, nor did it tend to come into play 
when he was an aspiring artist. Much 
of this can be attributed to the accept
ing nature of the generic folk audience. 
With less of a mainstream appeal, folk 
artists are able to maintain the integri
ty of the music, regardless of race, gen
der, age, or experience.

Location, location, location...
Friendships develop when people meet while doing what theyd normally do.
Shanmei Lim/Photo Staff
Groups of people gather all over to smoke on and off campus, but among the most recognizable are the smokers outside of Cathedral Mansions.
iTesse Felter only waits a few minutes in front of Warner 
Hall before he hears the familiar grinding sound of skate
board wheels rubbing against the concrete sidewalks of the 
Purnell Center. He instinctively looks up to see a lone figure 
gliding towards him.
There he is, says Felter, a junior information systems 
major. He stands up and ollies into the air, landing on his 
skateboard with the finesse of a ballet dancer. Skating toward 
him is Mark MacWhinney, a CMU alumnus. Felter skates up to 
him and they both stop mid-pathway to say hello. Slowly, 
other skaters show up to partake in the ritual of meeting in 
front of Warner. After the formalities, they get back on their 
boards and begin to warm up, swirling around as though fric
tion wasnt applicable to them. They launch themselves down 
sidewalk steps, onto railings, and against concrete slabs as 
though gravity doesn't exist.
Gravity does apply to the four figures standing under the 
halogen lighting outside Cathedral Mansions on a cold
October evening. The air is so frigid that some of them shift 
from side to side to keep themselves warmer as they take 
quick drags on their cigarettes. They begin to discuss the fra
ternities and how unfair it is that they have monopolized all 
decent social activity at CMU.
Brian Intoccia, a sophomore math major, immediately 
begins spewing bitter insults about the Greek system towards 
Jake Platt, who is a member of Sigma Nu. Laughter spills from 
the other two as Intoccia and Platt pretend to argue. 
Conversation continues like this until they each put out their 
cigarettes, all of them waiting until the last person is done, 
before going back to their separate apartments together.
In an environment where most people are only here for four 
years before graduating and leaving, friendships are formed 
in interesting ways. A person that you meet in passing at a 
party or in a meeting could very well become your closest 
friend within the next few months. Or your roommate from 
freshman year might pretty much disappear after you each
move onto opposite sides of the campus. People come and go 
quickly in a university setting, and so your real friends  and 
what keeps you and them together  are realized as the years 
go on.
For these two groups, the skaters outside of Warner and the 
smokers outside of Cathedral Mansions, part of what keeps 
them together is the place.
Its flat, big, downhill, takes little energy to get up here, 
and its a good place to warm up while Im skating, 
MacWhinney about the sidewalks in front of Warner Hall, 
which provide the skaters with the cleanest concrete on cam
pus and attract skaters from all over Oakland.
Im from Pittsburgh, and when I was a kid we would come 
down to Oakland to skate, so I knew about this spot since I 
was 14, said MacWhinney.
This place, then, would become the setting for which numPillbox November 4, 2002

hadnt been for the smoking, we probably would have never 
met.
Felter feels that skateboarding provides him and his 
friends relief and solace from their worries.
"When you're going 100 
miles an hour and worry
ing about getting hit by a 
car, you're not going to 
be worrying about that 
homework assignment 
you didn't finish."
When we send out emails to each other, they say things 
like, Im done with all my shit. Lets go out and skate. and 
when we are skating, its like we just forget about our 
schoolwork and have fun, said Felter.
Its like, when youre going 100 miles an hour and worry
ing about getting hit by a car, youre not going to be worry
ing about that homework assignment you didnt finish, you 
know?
Some find friendship in the classroom, or a party, or a cof
fee shop. But others, untied to locale or prejudice, find 
friendships in the habits that bind, the greeting from a fel
low skateboarder, from the polite wait of a fellow smoker 
who wont extinguish your conversation just because they 
extinguished their cigarette.

He began smoking the summer after his first year and 
cites this habit as a major reason for his newfound relation
ships.
If I didnt smoke, I seriously wouldnt have any friends. 
All of my closest friends are people that I smoke with.
Platt says that Intoccia was the one to bring him into the 
group of smokers.
I was just walking by when Brian said Hey, who are you? 
Now we just do that to random people and its great! I think 
at one point we got about 15 people to stand outside with 
us, said Platt. Although not all the smokers in this large 
group are good friends, some of the relationships that grew 
out of a common habit have developed into real friendships.
Basically, I eat almost all of my dinners with these guys, 
said Intoccia. I hang out with Jake all the time, and watch 
Sopranos on his computer. We go out on Saturday nights 
together. Theyre my best friends here. Theyre my crew.
I finally got the 
balls to ask if they 
wanted to skate 
with me. We took 
down each others 
numbers and the 
rest is history, said 
Felter.
The relation
ships made have 
moved far beyond skating and Warner Hall  they are now 
good friends.
I go to their parties with them and they come over to my 
place a lot, said Felter. I cant tell you why it happened, but 
it just did. We all just got really close.
For the smokers, the place where they live became impor
tant to them as each of them joined the group of people 
smoking outside. Because the group is so visible  they 
stand right outside of Cathedral Mansions  and because 
smoking forces them to constantly meet outside, developing 
relationships was inevitable.
Intoccia lived in Hammerschlag his first year and did not 
build many solid relationships.
I didnt have a good year and I didnt make a lot of 
friends, said Intoccia.
I think that smoking 
wasnt really what 
brought us together. It 
was just a reason for us 
to get together, 
explained Intoccia.
If you dont know 
somebody, you cannot 
justify why you guys 
hang out, but if you 
have a reason to do something together, you have a reason to 
hang out together. Smoking was our reason at first, but now 
it goes way beyond that.
Also, living near one another plays a large factor in how 
close they all are. Michael Chermysh, a sophomore business 
major, says that living near one another was one of the first 
steps towards creating relationships beyond the sporadic, 
chance meetings of smoking outside.
One time we just decided to order food and went over to 
someones apart
ment to eat. After 
that, we kept going 
over to each others 
apartments and I 
think that is what got 
us together, said 
Chermysh.

Smoking, of course, 
is highly addictive. But 
it is more than the nico

also the ritual.
We are all openminded to each other

November release preview
Summer movies turned out to be pretty good, so maybe its time now for cinema to start being crummy again.
This is November, when the studios whip 
out their big guns and officially begin the 
Oscar chase ... right? Considering the surpris
ingly high quality of this past summers line
up (Minority Report, Insomnia, Road to 
Perdition), it seems that the movie studios 
decided they should make up for it this fall 
with some really crappy movies. Theres still 
plenty of potential for a great night at the 
movies, and some intellectual movie banter to 
boot, but you may have to look hard to find it.
MAKE A NOTE OF IT: These films are the 
most likely to be worth the price of admis
sion, even if it is an insanely high $8. Thats 
right. Im talking to you, Loews.
Auto-Focus
Any movie starring Willem Dafoe is worth 
checking out, especially when hes playing 
John Carpenter. Here, Carpenter is a bad 
influence on Hogans Heroes star Bob Crane 
(played by Greg Kinnear) and sends him 
down a path of moral decay, which leads to 
adultery, pornography, scandal, and finally 
his bizarre murder-by-tripod death in 1978. 
Now in theaters.
8 Mile
Eminem? Acting? In a good movie? Well, 
yes, allegedly. Word is his debut in this urban 
drama is much stronger than Britneys, but 
that really isnt saying much. Whatever the 
quality of Eminems performance, he is sur
rounded by great talent, such as director 
Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) and co-star 
Kim Basinger (as Eminems mother), in what 
is supposed to be one of her finest perform
ances. Wide release November 8.
The Emperors Club
Now that The Life of David Gale has been 
bumped to 2003, Universal is supposedly 
resting all of their Oscar-hopes on this film,
Salma Hayek as Frida.
which stars Kevin Kline as a teacher at a pri
vate school who guides his boys into and 
throughout adulthood. Universal is confi
dent, but the trailer isnt encouraging (it 
comes off as a mainstream Dead Poets 
.Society). This one is probably the riskiest of 
the bunch. Wide release November 22.
Far From Heaven
Come Oscar time, this likely has the best 
shot of any November film. Starring Julianne 
Moore and Dennis Quaid, directed by Todd 
Haynes, and scored by Elmer Bernstein, its 
rumored to have top-notch work by all. The 
plot depicts a 1950s housewife who discovers 
her husbands homosexual tendencies and 
her own feelings for their black gardener. 
Sure, it sounds contrived, but the trailer sure 
looks amazing. Wide release November 8.
Frida
This film biography of Frida Kahlo has 
been in production for years, and now, 
thanks in large part to star Salma Hayek, its 
finally hitting the big screen with an all-star 
cast. Director Julie Taymor is best known for 
ground-breaking visual work on Broadways 
The Lion King and Titus, the film adaptation 
of Shakespeares Titus Andronicus. Judging 
from the previews, she doesnt disappoint. 
Wide release November TBA.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 
Last years top-grossing film is now releas
ing its sequel. This time, the Hogwarts School 
is in trouble, and who shall come to its res
cue? You guessed it: our favorite little wizard, 
Harry Potter, and his gang of mischievous 
mates. So what if its mainstream mediocrity? 
Its entertaining and thats all that matters, 
right? Wide release November 15.
Punch-Drunk Love
There will be lots of confused people 
watching this movie. Some 
will be Adam Sandler loyalists 
who are utterly disappointed 
by how un-Sandler this film is. 
The others will be film buffs 
who are utterly thrilled by

by P.T. Anderson (Boogie

Adam Sandlers 8 
Crazy Nights 
This is a year of 
experimentation 
for Adam Sand
ler. His other 
November film,
Punch-Drunk 
Love, was an 
experiment in 
actually acting.
Now, Sandler is 
taking a stab at 
animated fea
tures. The latter 
did not turn out 
so well. Perhaps, 
nervous about
what his loyalists would think of his dramatic 
work, Sandler has created a foul, poorly ani
mated, stereotypical Sandler-film. Its 
Christmas/Chanukah-themed, so be sure to 
avoid it come holiday season. Wide release 
November 27.
Die Another Day
In yet another installment of the near-dead 
James Bond series, Pierce Brosnan is fighting 
bad guys for the fourth time. This time its a 
deformed North Korean leader hes after. 
Thats timely. What is this, government prop
aganda? Halle Berry and Madonna (who 
sings the title song) are thrown into the mix 
in an attempt to put people in the seats, but 
will they be able to sit through the whole 
movie? Wide release November 22.
Friday After Next
Its appalling that there is yet another 
sequel in this ridiculously poor series. .It was 
tired halfway through the first movie, Friday. 
Even Ice Cube is above this. Wide release 
November 22.
Half Past Dead
Its a Steven Seagal film. Still interested? 
Then listen to this. In the preview, theres a 
jailhouse scuffle that leads a guard to say, 
Oh! So you wanna play rough? and then
Steven Seagal says something like, Sorry, Im 
straight. Still interested? Wide release

Murphy! Owen Wilson, too! This is a movie

term loose adaptation was coined. In fact, 
its so loose that Murphy is playing the role 
Robert Culp played in the NBC TV series, and 
Owen Wilson, Bill Cosbys role. Now in the
aters.
The Santa Clause 2 
This is a shame, because the first one was
nt so bad. It actually had a clever premise 
with some quality moments (child acting 
aside). This doesnt seem like it will match 
up. Now theres a Mrs. Clause, which states 
that Tim Allen must find a wife. The only way 
this could be more contrived is if Patricia 
Richardson played her. Now in theaters.
Treasure Planet 
Its Treasure Island in space. I cant believe 
someone thought this was a good premise, 
but its here, and a Disney animated feature, 
no less. Believe it or not, its considered a 
frontrunner for the Best Animated Feature 
category at the Oscars. What happened to the 
quality of animated movies this year? This is 
for the eyes of stupid kids and their suffering 
parents only. Wide release November 27.

screen for screen, in every movie 
theater across the country, the 
movie earned more than any other. 
And instead of the bottom dropping 
out of its sales the second weekend, 
they rose 22 percent  an unprece
dented jump that has both film actu
aries and audiences talking.
The Ring is based on a 1998 
Japanese film by the same name. 
Ringu found such popularity with 
the public that a sequel was made 
the same year. A third film, Ringu 0: 
Birthday (2000) fleshes out the antiheros back story.
The Ring has grossed $39 million 
at the box office so far, and its only 
been out a week.
But how does it measure up to 
other successful horror movies? 
Highest-ranking in dollars belongs 
to M. Night Shyamalans The Sixth 
Sense (1999), ranked 14th on the 
Internet Movie Databases top 100 
highest-grossing films of all time, 
with total earnings exceeding $293 
million. Jaws, (1975), the next highest-grossing horror movie at number 
19, earned $260 million. Also in the 
top 100 are The Exorcist (1973) and 
What Lies Beneath (2000), numbers
41 and 92, respectively. The Blair 
Witch Project only made it to number 
118, but its earnings, just shy of $150 
million, boosted the fledgling Haxan 
Entertainments recognition, if not 
acclaim, and encouraged 
Dreamworks to take the same kind 
of PR risks.
Because The Blair Witch Project 
was promoted by its distributors as 
real-life documentary footage found 
after the disappearance of a team of 
student filmmakers, the movies 
hype was disseminated as urban leg
end. Many audience members saw 
the movie still believing its premise 
was real  and those who didnt 
wished they had.
Id fortunately gotten an 
advanced copy of this film from a 
friend who worked for a studio. He 
was smart enough to tell me that the 
whole thing was real and that these 
were actual tapes they found of 
these lost kids, wrote IMDb user 
Erin Finn, I was scared to death!
Blair Witch is one example of
ingenious creativity knocking the 
flashy competitions block off. Prior 
to its January 25,1999 release in the 
US, this film was in the Guinness 
Book Of World Records for Top 
Budget: Box Office Ratio. The film 
cost $22,000 to make and made back 
$240.5 million, a ratio of $1 spent 
for every $10,931 made.
Dreamworks and The Ring director 
Gore Verbinski tried to tap into the 
same word-of-mouth effect.
Although the movies marketing 
campaign did not try to encourage 
the idea that the movie was real, or 
that watching the movie itself would 
kill anyone, the intention was to 
remind audiences of scary stories 
theyd already heard.
Theres a viral aspect, I think, to 
an urban myth, Verbinkski said in a 
Dreamworks publicity interview, 
the way it catches on, the way its 
repeated, the way its told.
Thrilling some and underwhelm
ing others, the Ringu movies feature 
an unnaturally silent soundscape, a 
breath-held slowness and lighting 
that sometimes renders visibility 
almost nil  the very features that 
sometimes make it unpalatable to 
American viewers, but help to 
endow it with the sense that every
thing is too still, too quiet, and that 
anything could happen at any 
moment.
So whats scarier  the slash and 
flash of big-budget Hollywood, or 
the slow-unfolding mystery of offer
ings from overseas? Or the fact that 
the latter might be gaining ground 
on the former?
Hollywood horror films have 
been headed down the wrong track 
for years now, said Clark Perry, a 
graduate playwright in the drama 
department.
Theyre increasingly designed to 
sell soundtrack CDs, posters, 
videogames (or theyre inspired by 
videogames to sell more 
videogames) ... and at their most 
desperate, they spoof the cliches of 
the genre. Overall, theyve forgotten 
one of the basic tenets of the horror 
film: to tell a story that scares us.

All About Lily Chou Chou
Closing in on the end of CMAs Japanese film s,eries
The movie opens with the sound of the frenetic 
clicking of fingers on a keyboard. Phrases are being 
typed onto the screen. The word ether permeates 
the conversation. The scene changes and we are 
absorbed into the world of 14-year-old Yuichi. He 
stands in a rice field at sunset, Discman in hand as 
he listens to the ethereal, throbbing melodies of Lily 
Chou Chou, a pop star whom he idolizes. The typing 
continues uninterrupted, but now we understand. 
The ether is the the fluid that nurses Lilys 
music. We are on Yuichis website, Lilyphilia, and 
these are her adoring fans exchanging messages 
back and forth.
All about Lily Chou Chou, the most recent film in 
the Carnegie Museum of Arts showcase of Japanese 
cinema, is the latest from director Shinji Iwai. Best 
known in the West for his films Love Letter and April 
Story, Iwai has created a telling masterpiece about 
the isolation of todays youth. Iwais topic may not 
be new, but his approach certainly is.
A student in a rural town, Yuichi is repeatedly bul
lied by a gang of classmates. Their leader is Hoshino
 intelligent, taciturn, and insanely cruel. After a 
scene in which Hoshinos gang pummel Yuichi, the 
movie flashes back in time.
A year before, Hoshino was the top student in his 
school. An outcast among his classmates, Hoshino 
befriended Yuichi. The two went to Okinawa during 
a summer vacation, during which Hoshino nearly 
drowned. As the new school year started, things 
changed: Hoshino became a ruthless gang leader, 
terrorizing both his former bullies and his innocent 
friends.
In some of the movies most horrific scenes,
Hoshino humiliates the class bully, blackmails a girl, 
Tsuda, into selling her body to middle-aged busi
nessmen, and orchestrates the brutal rape of 
Yuichis crush Kuno, a quiet pianist who constandy 
plays Debussy.
But what ties these seemingly disparate charac
ters together is Lily Chou Chou. Yuichi, Hoshino, 
and Tsuda all find refuge in Lilys music. But eventu
ally, as Hoshinos cruelty increases, Iwais characters 
have less and less to hold on to.
I am running out of ether, types Yuichi.
The movies downward spiral ends in a tragic, cli
mactic scene at one of Lilys live concerts.
The film, in keeping with the vague, enchanting 
tones of Lilys music, has a similarly vague look and 
feel. In Yuichis world, it is always sunset. The soft, 
muted light washes over the characters, its subtlety 
hiding, rather than revealing, their facial expres
sions. The dialogue is often clipped and superficial.
The movies tragic tone lies in its deep, immense 
silences, punctuated sometimes by Lilys music, 
sometimes by the romantic strains of Debussy. It is 
in these silences that Yuichis world is truly revealed: 
cruel, painful, and isolated. Yuichi and his friends 
prefer to keep their emotions bottled up between 
their headphones. In one of the movies most telling 
scenes, Yuichi, Tsuda, and Hoshino stand wavering 
in the rice fields listening to Lily. We can see them 
from afar, but they cannot see each other.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pondo
I remember sitting in Miss Swansons class during a waim spring dajrinthe4lh grade. She spoke at length 
about long division, Abraham Lincoln, and the like while I stared out the window. I saw squirrels and rabbits 
and ducks. Lots of ducks. As I watdied intently, I could see that one duck was in feet leading the others into 
formation, apparendy readying for an attack on the school. The central duck quacked loudly for a few 
moments, and he was answered by a resounding quack from the rest. Never before had I seen su a show 
from such magnificent creatures. Suddenly, the leader turned his head to peer straight at me, and he nodded. 
The ducks began their march on the building. School was cancelled for the rest of the day.

the weekends geeky movies, events include:
Wednesday, November 6: Video Games! 4 to 9 pm in 
McConomy.
Prosperos Books 
Thursday, November 7 
5 pm, 7:30 pm, 10 pm & 12:30 am
In the great tradition of Thursday movies, this one is very 
artistic and Shakespeare-oriented. Why should you see this 
allegedly visionary retelling of HEA HAJdAev? Well, besides the 
graphic nudity, time-tested plot, graphic nudity, fantastic cin
ematography, graphic nudity, talented cast, and graphic 
nudity, not much.
Geek Week Events: sALrahvirt OC- 5 pm in McConomy. And 
Video Games! 4:30 to 9:30 pm DH 2315.
The Bourne Identity 
Friday, November 8 
7:30 pm, 10 pm & 12:30 am
Many people say this movie kicks iarge amounts of but
tock. Many people also say that this movie sucked large 
amounts of buttock. Do you think youre like many people, or 
like other many people? Its a romantic comedy, if that factors 
into the equation. Go on, take a risk. Youll never know other
wise, and its cheaper than renting.
Geek Week Event: Nerf guns! in the Danforth Lounge. 2:30 to 
5:30 pm
Austin Powers in Goldmember 
Saturday, November 11 
8 pm, 10 pm & 12 am
The third of the series, Goldmember is, at best, decent. A 
lot of the old jokes have been reused, practically to death, but 
its main downfall seems to be that the plot is only there to 
hold together the jokes, and it comes off as forced. Dont mis
understand, this is worth seeing, but only once.
Geek Week Events: Legos! Peter/Wright/McKenna. 1 to 5 
pm (25 tubs worth, bare feet beware!) AND! Atom and His 
Package! Free! 8 pm at the Underground.
Visitor Q 
Sunday, November 10 
8 pm, 10 pm & 12 am
Good luck with this one. Also known as Bizita Q, it features 
rape, incest, and maternal abuse, but probably the best way 
for you to find out how all these wholesome family topics are 
connected is to go and see it. If you normally go to see the 
Sunday movie, the odds are in favor that you will enjoy this 
one as well, as it surely must be chock-full of weirdness.

does not make you selfish, but stealing all the blood drive 
cookies does, no matter how faint you say you feel.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Your stunning ability to con
sistently fail exams will be applauded by other students, 
who will benefit from the grade curve you help to create.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Stop being so para

happy and satisfying future. Compared to how awful your 
life is now, any change will surely be an

wearing flip-flops in Pittsburgh

December 21): The lack of mail you 
receive will become more upsetting 
when you realize you can gauge your 
mothers love by how many grocery coupons she sends 
you.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Think of this 
as an opportunity to impress your parents by telling them 
you are focusing on academics this semester, not a social 
life. It sounds both admirable and less pathetic than the 
depressing truth. ,
AQUARIUS (January 20 -
February 18): Though you will never 
receive a trophy or recognition, socie
ty thanks you for holding up the left 
s s^e t^ie success and happiness bell
Vanessa shyu/Art staff PISCES (February 19 - March 20): 
Your plan to at least be cool by association will fall 
through when you realize your friends are just as dorky as 
you are. Thats why they love you.
