On October 25, Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus Asad Zaidi was in Pittsburgh 
visiting a few friends from the 
University. Having graduated in 1999 
with a degree in computer science, 
Zaidi was currently employed as a 
software engineer by Beacon 
Partners, a health care management 
consulting firm, according to his 
resume found at an Internet message 
board.
According to Mark Stehlik, a prin
cipal lecturer in computer science 
and Zaidis advisor for his first year at 
CMU, Zaidi had tired of the private 
sector and had decided to apply to 
graduate schools. In the meantime,
he hoped to obtain a research posi
tion at his alma mater.
That Friday, Stehlik saw Zaidi for 
the last time. By the following 
Tuesday, October 29, Zaidi was dead. 
During the morning of October 28, 
Zaidi fell ill enough to visit University 
Health Services.
At approximately 11:15 am, 
Campus Police transported him to 
UPMC Presbyterian hospital where 
he lapsed into a coma.
Chief of Police Creig Doyle said 
medical cases are confidential and 
thus, he would not comment on the 
death.
According to Pittsburgh Police 
Lieutenant Mike Piesecki, hospital 
staff called the citys zone 6 station 
on October 29 to report that Zaidi 
had food poisoning and was not 
expected to survive. Zaidi died shortSee DEATH, page A4

PLO lawyer condemns Israel and US media
by Anne Jolis
Assistant News Editor
The woman from Ramallah said 
they are getting rid of the people and 
keeping the land.
On Wednesday night, Diana 
Buttu, the Palestinian Liberation 
Organizations (PLO) peace negotia
tions advisor, spoke to a lecture hall 
overflowing with violent critics and 
adoring fans alike, who strained to 
hear perhaps the most controversial 
speaker at CMU since Ken Adelman 
predicted the aggressive stance of 
the US towards Iraq.
Wielding a Stanford law degree, 
Buttu said that her main goal was to 
give the audience a perspective that 
she feels is ignored by the American 
media. Buttus parents came to 
Canada from Palestinian villages 
near Nazareth in the late 1960s and 
she hails from Toronto.
Im going to try to empower you. 
I want you to see whats going on, 
from the perspective of the 
Palestinian mind, she said. She told 
the audience that US media is
My only friend,
biased, and that it is in fact Israel 
who holds the most blame for the 
current crisis in the Middle East, not 
Palestinians.
Stop supporting Israels war 
crimes, she said. For [the 
Palestinians], its about a process of 
[Israel] getting rid of as many 
Palestinians as possible and holding 
on to their land.
She said that few people in the 
West recognize Israels actions for 
what they are  ethnic cleansing. 
She referred to the segments that 
Israel had set aside for Palestinians 
as illegal settlements, and remind
ed the audience that Israel is cur
rently in violation of 85 UN Security 
Council regulations. Iraq, according 
to Buttu, violates only 16.
She said that Israel is not only dis
placing Palestinian families and 
destroying their economy (50 per
cent of Palestinians are unemployed, 
and most live on less than two dol
lars a day), but that 20 percent of 
Palestinian children are severely 
malnourished.
People are basically dying. 
Theyve gotten rid of us  theyve
gotten rid of the people. But theyve 
kept the land, she said, as she 
repeated her people/land mantra 
and accused Israel of engaging in 
illegal occupation of the land by way 
of banishing Palestinians to seg
ments surrounded by checkpoints. 
Buttu said that Palestinians are sur
rounded by walls 25 feet tall, taller 
than even the Berlin wall was.
Theres nothing in the world that 
can prepare you for occupation, 
except maybe living in jail, she said, 
as she painted a picture filled with F16 bombs, tanks, helicopters, and 
armed guards littering the daily lives 
of the Palestinians. According to 
Buttu, the curfews imposed on the 
Palestinians are broken on penalty of 
death. If a person opens their door 
during curfew, they could be killed. 
She told her audience that 80 per
cent of these deaths are children.
As passionate and eloquent as 
Buttu was, many members of CMUs 
community were still shocked that 
the University would welcome her as 
a lecturer.

Campus Police build crime 
network with area colleges
by Andrew Johnson
News Editor
CMU police have identified a sus
pect in a string of burglaries thanks 
to a new crime information net
work developed by Detective Martin 
White of Campus Police. The system 
links crime prevention units through
out the city.
Schools such as Chatham, Robert 
Morris, and the University of 
Pittsburgh now formally share cer
tain crime information via email and 
the network extends to hospitals, 
postal authorities, and the nearby 
Zone 6 of city police.
The Pitt News called for a crime 
network between the schools as far 
back as September.
The assault at Pitt was the straw 
that broke the camels back for me, 
said White. There was an immediate 
Yeah, lets do this [from police at 
other locations].
White referred to an incident in 
which an armed assailant attacked 
two female Pitt students on 
September 22.
Police and security officials share 
the parts of incident reports for 
crimes that would require an arrest. 
With regard to the string of off-campus burglaries, police matched up 
surveillance from a video camera at 
one location with suspect descrip
tions from other events.
White said shared information 
focuses on the crime and the actor
and omits much of the personal 
information about victims unless the 
units work together jointly to solve 
the crime.
He said departments send 
abridged reports that focus on the 
crime and actor to each other.
White began his career at CMU 15 
years ago as a security guard. Since 
his promotion to detective in 1998, 
White has had to solve crimes instead 
of break up rabble-rousers.
Every month, I try and do a crime 
analysis, said White.
The detective combs over crime 
reports to find patterns in modus 
operandi, or MO. He looks for pat
terns in descriptions of people, types 
of weapons used, and details like 
whether or not a door was unlocked.
Representatives now meet once a 
month to discuss the network. They 
plan to address how better to share 
photographical data at the next 
meeting on November 26. Their first 
meeting on October 21 addressed 
which information to share, and how 
to share it. Campus Police Chief Creig 
Doyle said the lack of a network 
when he arrived two years ago sur
prised him. Doyle interviewed for 
another police chief position in 
Baltimore as he considered the CMU 
job and found that Baltimore colleges 
knew who was stealing from whom. 
White said it had always been in the 
back of his mind.

CIT students 
offeredfive 
year MBA/BS
by Nick Ennis
Staffwriter
Juniors in CIT will receive an email 
today inviting them to a meeting 
Thursday that will detail an integrat
ed Masters of Business Administration 
(MBA) program with GSLA. to pre
mier next fall.
While engineering students have 
long been able to take advantage of 
integrated masters programs within 
their respective departments, the 
plan will allow students to earn both 
a MBA and a BS in engineering after 
only five years of studying at 
Carnegie Mellon. Neither GSIA nor 
CIT have officially announced the 
full details of the program yet.
However, students can expect to 
earn two fully independent degrees 
at the end of the five-year program, 
according to Robert Kail, associate 
dean of CIT. The most difficult part of 
planning the program has been to 
ensure that neither degree is com
promised. Kail said that students 
would still need to take all of the 
requirements currently needed for 
each degree, totaling 500 to 540 
units. Kail said that engineering pre
pares students for a business educa
tion because they have a quantitative 
background and are accustomed to 
thinking mathematically.
The MBA has always been popular 
among engineers later in their 
careers and, according to Kail, busi
ness administration is the second 
most earned minor by CIT students.
Graduate business schools usually 
expect at least two years of realworld experience from applicants. 
However, Kail indicated that the pro
gram may require applicants to have 
summer internship experience 
before beginning their graduate 
studies. According to GSIAs admis
sions website, Candidates with post
undergraduate professional experi
ence have, everything else equal, a 
better chance for admission, but we 
welcome applications from excep
tionally talented and motivated indi
viduals who may not have significant 
experience.
The website adds that admitted 
students have an average of 4.5 years 
of professional experience.
Work experience is important for 
graduate business students. How can 
they contribute to the class and 
understand what is going on without 
it? said Diana Henderson, a junior 
ECE student. She said she plans to 
pursue an MBA eventually and would 
have been interested in the integrat
ed program had she not already com
mitted to a double major.

Buggy accidents trouble weekend free-rolls
by Anne Jolis
Assistant News Editor
Grace Yoon, a driver for Phi Kappa 
Thetas (Phi Kap) buggy team, 
crashed into a parking meter pole at 
25 mph and received several lacera
tions to her face last weekend. She 
doesnt know when, if at all, she will 
be back inside a buggy. She crashed 
when her headband came down over 
her eyes and blinded her, causing her 
to swerve and hit the pole in the 
chute. A first-year H&SS student, 
Yoon had driven for Phi Kap for two 
and a half months before the acci
dent.
Im not going to say it was trau
matizing or anything, but after an 
accident youre kind of shaken up a 
bit, said Yoon. Its a normal feeling 
for a person to have after an acci
dent.
Yoon said that she loves driving the 
buggy and does not believe that any
one was at fault for the accident. 
However, she is not sure she wants to 
return to the road.
I really would like to do it, but I 
have a recurring thought of crashing 
again. Also, my family isnt as com
fortable with my doing it since the 
accident, said Yoon. Its something I 
still have to think about.
This year, race day falls on April 11
 almost five months away  but 
buggy practice is well underway and 
will end on the weekend of November
23.
Despite the events extensive safety 
regulations, the season has already 
seen its share of accidents.
The same weekend that Yoon sus
tained her injuries, Cecilia Ikedas 
Fringe team buggy went up on two
wheels and veered into the protective 
hay bales. Ikeda received several cuts 
to her lip.
Lucia Cytrynowicz, a driver for the 
Carnegie Involvement Association 
(CIA) team, caught her right hand 
inside the spoke of the buggys front 
wheel while moving at a slow speed 
and injured her thumb.
Cytrynowicz, a sophomore sci
ences and humanities scholar, says 
that her thumb is much better, and 
she is able to write with that hand 
again.
CIAs team had another accident 
earlier this semester, involving a 
buggy scraping a hay bale. Both the 
driver and buggy rolled again the 
next day. Ikeda and Cytrynowicz say 
that their accidents were isolated 
events, and that their chances of 
being seriously hurt are slim.
The injury I had is very unlikely to 
occur at high speeds since the spokes 
of the wheel would have been moving 
too quickly for my thumb to go in 
between them, said Cytrinowicz.
Despite the accidents, the vast 
majority of buggy drivers love their 
jobs and accept the risks. Yoon, 
Ikeda, and Cytrynowicz all agree that 
the benefits of buggy driving out
weigh the disadvantages.
Cytrinowicz cites excitement, peo
ple, parties, pancakes on Saturday, 
and free massages as some of her 
favorite aspects of driving a buggy.
Its not as dangerous as it seems. I 
knew the risks going into it, and I was 
really nervous at first, but it was real
ly fun once I did it, said Yoon, adding 
that driving has allowed her to meet 
new people.

Al Qaida may plan
 a major US attack
WASHINGTON (AP)  Al Qaida
- may be planning a spectacular ter_ rorist attack intended to damage the
US economy and inflict large-scale
* casualties, the FBI warns.
- " An FBI law enforcement bulletin 
circulated Thursday to officials
1 nationwide contains no information
 about the timing, location, or method 
of a possible attack. Even so, the 
warning is unusual because of its dire 
language.
T Sources suggest alQaida may 
favor spectacular attacks that meet 
several criteria: High symbolic value, 
mass casualties, severe damage to the
 US, economy and maximum psycho- logical trauma, says the alert, which 
' was posted on the FBIs web site early 
' Friday after its existence was report
ed by The New York Times and The
 Associated Press.
 The highest priority targets remain 
within the aviation, petroleum, and 
nuclear sectors, as well as significant 
national landmarks, it adds.
Federal authorities previously have 
issued warnings for those specific 
' industries and national landmarks in 
general. But there is clearly worry
- that the danger of an attack is grow
ing because of increased chatter
' picked up through intelligence chan
nels, the continuing US showdown
 With Iraq, and the recently revealed 
audiotaped warnings believed to be 
from alQaida leader Osama bin 
iaden.
- ' Still, the latest warning has not led 
the Bush administration to raise the 
-terrorist threat level above code yel
low, or elevated, which is the mid die of a five-level scale of risk devel
oped after the September 11, 2001 
'attacks.
White House spokesman Scott 
McClellan said that although the ter' rorism risk level remains unchanged, 
'We are taking additional precau1 tions to meet the threat.
These include unspecified addi
tional steps to ramp up our protection 
and prevention measures within fed
eral agencies, McClellan said. The FBI 
and other agencies also are communi
cating possible threats and assess
ments of risk to state and local law 
enforcement agencies and specific 
industries that could be targeted.
In recent weeks, the FBI has issued 
warnings about possible attacks on 
US railroads and on the energy indus
try, as well as a more general warning 
about heightened risk during the 
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, 
which started Wednesday and ends 
December 5.
Were especially sensitive to time
frames which might be thought by 
the enemy to be a time when they 
might want to make a statement, 
Attorney General John Ashcroft said.
On Wednesday, the FBI told 
authorities in Houston, Chicago, San 
Francisco, and Washington to be 
aware of threats against hospitals. 
Even though that threat was assigned 
low credibility by senior law enforce
ment officials, the FBI is preferring to 
err on the side of caution when giving 
out information, officials said. The 
idea is to increase vigilance among 
police and people working in indus
tries that are potential targets.
Last week, the State Department 
warned that Thursdays execution of 
Pakistani Aimal Khan Kasi in Virginia 
could lead to reprisals against 
Americans. Two days after his 
November 1997 conviction, assailants 
shot and killed four American oil 
company workers in Karachi, 
Pakistan. Kasi was executed for 
killing two CIA employees in a 1993 
shooting outside the agencys head
quarters.
Hu Jintao to lead 
Chinese reforms
BEIJING (AP)  A former engineer 
whose personality and philosophy are 
mysteries to most Chinese became 
their most powerful leader Friday, 
appointed to guide their ruling party 
through convulsive economic reforms 
that are pushing Chinas doors open 
to a curious world.
The Communist Party, Chinas 
supreme authority, chose Vice 
President Hu Jintao as its new gener
al secretary. That made Hu, a politi
cian on the rise for more than a 
decade, the de facto leader of Asia's 
fastest-growing economy and assured 
his election as president next year.
The changing of the guard, widely 
expected for years, was communist 
Chinas first orderly transfer of 
authority and sent President Jiang 
Zemin toward retirement. It put Hu at 
the helm of a new generation of lead
ers who will guide China through 
sweeping changes  including market-oriented reforms that are trans
forming hundreds of millions of lives.
We will live up to the great trust of 
the entire party and the expectations 
of people across the country, said 
Hu, an engineer who used to build 
hydroelectric power stations.

Virginia executes 
Pakistani killer
JARRATT, Va. (AP)  Softly chant
ing There is no god but Allah in his 
native language until he lost con
sciousness, a Pakistani man was put 
to death by injection for the slayings 
of two CIA employees gunned down 
outside the agencys headquarters in 
1993.
Now that Aimal Khan Kasi has been 
executed, the State Department is 
bracing for retaliation some fear may 
erupt against Americans around the 
globe.
Kasi, 38, spent his last hour praying 
with a Muslim cleric before being put 
to death Thursday night at the 
, Greensville Correctional Center. He 
; died at 9:07 p.m.
i Kasis execution focused interna! tional attention on the tiny town of 
Jarratt, where security around the 
prison was greatly increased in 
response to warnings from the State 
Department that his death might put 
Americans in danger.
State troopers accompanied Kasi 
into the death chamber. Two correc
tional officers with shotguns stood on 
each side of the road near the prison 
entrance, and several armed officersIi were posted in front of the prison, 
i Kasi told The Associated Press last 
! week he had no regrets about the 
[ killings but did not want any retaliaJ tion for his execution. Kasis family 
] near Quetta, Pakistan, also pleaded 
t for calm.
Kasis are a peaceful tribe. We 
I want peaceful solutions to every 
I' problem, said his older brother, 
Nasibullah Kasi. We do not want thetKasi name to be used to harm any
body.
Kasi killed CIA communications 
worker Frank Darling, 28, and CIA 
analyst and physician Lansing 
Bennett, 66, as they sat in their cars at 
a stoplight in McLean. Three other
men  another CIA analyst, an engi
neer and an AT&T employee  were 
wounded as Kasi shot into a row of 
stopped cars with a semiautomatic 
AK-47 rifle.
Im satisfied that justice was 
done, said Raymond F. Morrogh,

$1.2 million paid 
by gun distributor
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)  
Both sides are claiming victory after a 
gun distributor was ordered to pay 
$1.2 million to the widow of a teacher 
killed by a teen gunman.
The six-woman jurys decision, 
announced Thursday, found that 
Valor Corp. was liable for 5 percent of 
a $24 million judgment for selling the 
small handgun that 13-year-old 
Nathaniel Brazill used to shoot Barry 
Grunow more than two years ago.
The suit contended Valor was 
responsible because the weapon 
lacked a childproof gun lock and 
could be associated with a toy 
because of its small size.
The judgment assigned half the 
blame to Elmore McCray, the family 
friend who kept the gun unlocked in a 
dresser drawer, where Brazill found 
it. The Palm Beach County School 
Board was found 45 percent responsi
ble for allowing Brazill to bring a 
weapon hidden in his pocket onto 
campus. The judgments against 
McCray and the School Board will not 
be collected because they were not 
defendants in the case.
Widow Pam Grunows attorneys 
said the verdict  the first in which a 
gun distributor has been found liable 
in a death  should urge the gun 
industry to stop selling the small, 
inexpensive weapon, known com
monly as a Saturday Night Special.
This is a huge victory for safer 
guns, said Allen Rostron, an attorney 
for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun 
Violence. Defense attorneys, mean
while, touted the jurys decision as a 
fair compromise.

Support for Israel 
wanes at colleges
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (U-WIRE)  
In the latest action taken by univer
sity groups pushing for divestment 
from Israel, members of a facultyled campaign at Columbia 
University Wednesday presented a 
petition and statement to the 
schools Advisory Committee on 
Socially Responsible Investing.
The Columbia petition calls for 
the university to divest itself from 
companies that manufacture or sell 
arms and military hardware to 
Israel until its compliance with the 
relevant UN resolutions and 
Geneva conventions.
The responsible investing com
mittee, which advises university 
trustees, would not reach any con
clusion at the hearing, Brinkely 
Messick, professor of anthropology 
at Columbia and spokesperson for 
the campaign, told The Herald 
before the meeting. He had no 
idea whether divestment will 
occur. It is significant if the uni
versity even considers it, he said.
Signatories are also concerned 
with what they see as the US gov
ernments unquestioning support 
of Israel, Messick said.
The petition specifically targets 
Columbias investments in Boeing 
Corporation and General Electric, 
manufacturers of the Apache heli
copter; Caterpillar, manufacturer 
of D9 bulldozers; and LockheedMartin Corporation, manufacturer of 
fighter jets. The group is also 
demanding a detailed review of the 
universitys portfolio holdings. 
Lauren Marshall, public affairs officer 
at Columbia, was not available for 
comment.
The divestment campaign at 
Columbia is faculty-led, though stu
dents organized sit-ins and protests 
against Israeli military actions last 
spring, Messick said. Ninety-eight 
faculty members and over 200 stu
dents have signed the petition so far.
Petitions for divestment from Israel 
are circulating at other universities 
including Harvard University, the 
University of Pennsylvania, Cornell 
University, Princeton University, and 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. The issue has not come 
up at Brown, said Mark Nickel, direc
tor of the Brown News Service.
Cynthia Frost, vice president and 
chief investment officer at Brown, 
could not be reached for comment.
The Penn petition calls for the uni
versity to divest from all companies 
whose business promotes the Israeli 
occupation.
BU proud to host 
2004 convention
BOSTON (U-WIRE)  Ive got 
great news, said Terry McAuliffe, 
chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee. Boston is the site for the 
2004 convention.
Cheers rang out in city hall and 
Mayor Thomas Menino flashed a 
smile after receiving the phone call 
yesterday from McAuliffe announcing 
Boston will host the 2004 Democratic
National Convention, which will 
attract hundreds of thousands of 
politicians, journalists and sup
porters to the city.
On the phone with McAuliffe in 
Washington, Massachusetts 
Senators Edward Kennedy and 
John Kerry praised Menino and 
voiced their excitement for the city.
Its a great, great moment for 
our city, said Kerry, who is expect
ed to run for the Democratic nomi
nation for president in 2004.
The Democratic National site 
selection committee voted unani
mously in favor of Boston over New 
York, Detroit, and Miami. While 
Boston has already raised $20 mil
lion, the convention will cost $50 
million, a cost that will be split 
between the city and the state. 
However, Boston is expected to 
take in about $150 million, city 
officials said.
Boston was chosen to host the 
convention because of financial 
pledges, hotels, transportation, 
and diversity, Menino said. Some 
of the renovations that will take 
place before July of 2004, when 
the convention will take place, are 
the building of a new convention 
center, a clean-up of Boston 
Harbor, and improvements at 
Logan International Airport.
Boston has assembled the com
plete package  strong leadership 
... deep commitment from political, 
civic and business leaders ... and 
first-rate facilities, McAuliffe said 
in a press release yesterday. Boston 
is a city that answers the call.
Kennedy, a Democrat, added 
that Boston is the cradle of liberty, 
of our values as a party.

Police search film 
office for evidence
PITTSBURGH (AP)  Allegheny 
County detectives have issued search 
warrants for the struggling 
Pittsburgh Film Office, which has 
been linked to a similar California 
agency involved in a financial scan
dal.
Detectives are expected to take sev
eral weeks to conduct the searches, 
district attorneys office spokesman 
Mike Manko said Tuesday. Officials 
would not specify where the searches 
were taking place.
Cathy McCollom, spokeswoman 
for the Pittsburgh Film Office, said 
she had not heard about the searches 
and had no comment.
Investigators from Los Angeles 
already have searched the Pittsburgh 
office. In previous court documents, 
investigators alleged that Cody Cluff, 
the head of a Los Angeles agency that 
tries to attract film and television pro
jects, misspent public money, includ
ing giving $20,000 to the Pittsburgh 
Film Office, headed by Dawn Keezer.
Investigators alleged Cluff and 
Keezer have been in a relationship

US Steel recruits 
for Kosice plant
PITTSBURGH (AP)  US Steel is 
trying to recruit US workers for its 
continued expansion in central 
Europe.
Salaried employees at the Mon 
Valley Works near Pittsburgh, and 
those from plants in Gary, Indiana 
and Fairfield, Alabama, are being 
invited to travelogue presentations 
next week. Executives from US Steel 
Kosice, the companys plant in 
Slovakia, are hosting the events.
Spokesman John Armstrong says 
the company wants to recruit 30 
employees to replace 30 US workers 
already at the Slovak mill. But the 
company also needs managers. US 
Steel has been heartened by the 
plants success so far.
The company purchased the Kosice 
plant in 2000, three years after form
ing a joint venture with its former 
owner.
US Steel officials have been so 
happy with the results that they're 
pursuing other plants in Europe, 
including a joint venture with a 
Serbian firm and possible deals with 
steelmakers in Poland and Hungary.

Bin Laden makes 
for stage musical
SAN JOSE, California (U-WIRE) 
 Comedy works with hot-button 
issues because the nature of come
dy is improper and, at times, can 
make people uncomfortable.
To talk about that which is for
bidden to talk about is inappropri
ate, and therefore comic, said 
Scott Sublett, a professor in the 
television, radio, film, and theatre 
department at San Jose State 
University.
His most recent project, Bye Bye 
bin Laden, is a musical comedy 
about Osama bin Ladens desire to 
get on television and opens Friday 
at the University Theatre. The idea 
for the play was inspired by an email Sublett received that com
pared the life of women in 
Afghanistan with American 
women.
The [comparison] was so 
bizarre and ridiculous and horrific 
and absurd. It was weirdly funny, 
he said. I was inspired to write a 
parody of a sitcom called I Love 
Prakhbar, which was the I Love 
Lucy show but with Osama bin 
Laden and one of his four wives.
Sublett said he wrote the skit as 
a way to play around with the for
mat of a TV sitcom and only 
intended it for his friends as enter
tainment.
It was not meant for any kind of 
public consumption, he said.
Barnaby Dallas, director of pro
ductions in the TRFT department, 
said he read the skit and thought it 
was hilarious.
He said the play is about 
manipulation of the public and 
how the media perpetuates it.
If there is anyone who gets 
attacked [in the play], its the 
media, Dallas said. The way 
they distort events, create fear, 
panic and hype.
Sublett said the original skit 
developed into a play that began 
as a musical review with loosely 
connected songs and skits, but it 
ended up to be a musical comedy 
with a storyline. The play is a 
satire on the impact of television 
and the relationship between the 
United States and the Taliban in 
Afghanistan. Long said the 
department struggled with the 
decision to do the play.
Breasts grow by 
new battery-bra
ATHENS, Ohio (U-WIRE)  
The US Food and Drug 
Administration has approved a 
new bra that gives women anoth
er option in breast augmentation.
The Brava Breast Enhancement 
and Shaping System, developed 
by Dr. Roger Khouri, is the first 
non-surgical technique for 
increasing the bust size.
The system is like a high-tech 
sports bra and weighs 1 to 2 
pounds, said Brava specialist 
Vivian Ruben. The battery-powered bra has of two domes, a 
small computer, and a sports bra.
It has two plastic domes, linked 
to a suction device, which are 
placed over the breasts, causing a 
vacuum, stretching the breast and 
causing cells to respond by slowly 
increasing in size.

 An officer on fraternity patrol 
noticed a male pushing a chair across 
Morewood Avenue. The officer 
noticed a female with the male as 
they both began to run up the hill 
towards the Alumni House parking 
lot. The officer stopped them as they 
ran into the Delta Upsilon fraternity 
house. The male identified himself as 
Dan Noday, and the officer told him 
that the chair he had belonged to the 
University, as it had a cluster services 
sticker on it. The officer smelled alco
hol on Nodays breath and he was 
given a state citation for underage 
consumption.
Liquor Laws, 11/9/02, 3:27 am
 An officer was radioed that a 
group of males and females were in a 
parking garage entrance area and had 
a shopping cart and a CMU moving 
cart. The officer stopped one of the 
males and he was identified as 
Benaldo Hernando. The student said 
that he was using the carts to move 
bales of hay for buggy. The students 
speech was slurred and the officer 
smelled alcohol on his breath. The 
officer issued him a state citation and 
he was allowed to leave with his 
friends.
Suspicious Person, 11/9/02, 
2:39 pm  Campus Police were noti
fied that a suspicious male entered 
the rear of Hamburg Hall. The officer 
found the male as he exited at the 
Forbes Avenue door. The man was

Forum discusses 
racial profiling
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  An 
open forum on campus safety at the 
University of Pittsburgh Monday 
night became a debate between stu
dents and Vice Provost for 
Undergraduate Studies and Dean of 
Students Jack Daniel about a plan 
that students and Daniel agreed 
upon to fight racial profiling.
In 2001, Student Government 
Board (SGB) passed a resolution to 
fight racial profiling on campus, 
leading to a 10-point plan focusing 
on police. Executive Vice Chancellor 
Jerome Cochran overturned some 
of the points, former SGB member 
Jay Dworin said.
Cochran acted in bad faith and 
misled students by allowing the 
meetings to go on and knowing 
Daniel did not have the authority to 
enforce these agreements, Dworin 
said.
According to Dworin, Cochran 
overturned demands from students 
to make police data concerning race 
public and to print students rights 
on police business cards.
Upon request, officers must give 
students a business card and if the 
officers do not have one at the time 
they must provide students with 
their name and badge number, 
according to Pitt police Commander 
Kathy Schrieber. But SGBs Andrea 
DeChellis said police do not always 
give out cards when asked.
Dworin said that Dr. Daniel did a 
really nice job in helping create the 
10-point plan, but he later ques
tioned Daniel and other administra
tors lack of action after Cochran 
overturned some of the agreements.
Is there a reason why no one 
stepped up and asked why? he 
said.
Many in the audience booed 
when Daniel responded to Dworins 
question with, I think we should 
move on.
Pitt student Erika Strauss said at 
the forum, I feel that the panelists 
are very defensive. Im really disap
pointed that Jays question wasnt 
answered.
SGB member LaTasha Mayes 
asked the panel, Can you look at 
me as a person and tell me that 
racial profiling does not exist on this 
campus?
I truly implore you to listen to us, 
she said.
Daniel said that, when he made the 
agreements, he acted in good faith. 
After making the agreements, he was 
informed he did not have jurisdiction 
over enforcing these policies, he said.
Panelists discuss 
gender roles
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  A panel 
of four top executive women suggest
ed Thursday that it might be impossi
ble to have it all.
The women were chosen by 
University of Pittsburghs Women in 
Business organization to represent 
successful women in the corporate 
world. One of the issues the panel 
focused on is the difficulty of balanc
ing work and family.
The phrase yu can bring home 
the bacon and fry it too was originat
ed by a man, said Ola Jackson, the 
owner of Onyx Womens Magazine. I 
dont think you can ... somethings 
going to compromise.
The panelists also included Jean 
Bonar, a vice president at PNC Bank 
and two executives from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an interna
tional accounting firm.
Christina Black, the president of 
Women in Business said, The reality 
is that women do face different issues 
than men in the workplace. Now we 
get the opportunity to hear, first
hand, how to level the playing field.
Jackson said she decided to only 
have one child instead of three and 
her husband helps a great deal with 
their son.
Two of the other women on the 
panel waited until they were older to 
get married and plan to adopt their 
children.
Jackson said it is important to cus
tomize your goals so that they suit 
you when deciding how to prioritize 
work and family.
Laura Havrilla, a partner at 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, said bal
ance is crucial.
If you spend one week killing 
yourself working overtime and don't 
get a chance to see much of your fam
ily, leave work a little early the next 
week, she said.
The panelists also addressed per
ceptions of women in the workplace. 
They agreed that businessmen in gen
eral are becoming more aware of 
womens issues in the workplace. 
Bonar, for example, said many men 
now have wives who work and so 
they are more sympathetic to their 
needs.
They all get a ten for getting up 
there, said Mark Carver, artist lectur
er for the school of music and Mr. 
Fraternity judge. I dont have the 
courage to parade around in my 
underwear in front of a bunch of col. lege kids.
Although undergarments were not 
one of the five showcase events for 
Mr. Fraternity 2002, many of the con
testants chose to display theirs. For 
the talent event, Ross Krupnik of 
Alpha Epsilon Pi reenacted the 
famous Risky Business scene, socks 
and all. Matt Spiro of Delta Upsilon 
wore little more than a diaper for the 
beachwear competition.
Men from 11 fraternities participat
ed in the sixteenth annual beauty 
pageant hosted by Kappa Alpha 
Theta.
Each fraternity chooses their rep
resentative, said Theresa Nguyen, 
senior biology major and Mr. 
Fraternity chairperson, Sometimes 
they make their pledges do it and 
sometimes they vote.
The contestants were critiqued in 
beachwear, toga wear, talent, formalwear, and question and answer com
petitions. Seven faculty were chosen 
to judge the men. Liz Watkins, history 
professor, said she was instructed to 
consider such aspects as originality 
and stage presence in her scoring. 
The audience also voted.
The proceeds, a projected $2,000 
to $2,500, go to the Ohio Breathing 
Association in honor of a sorority sis
ter who died of an asthma attack six
teen years ago.
According to Amy Timko, senior 
chemical engineering major, mem
bers from all of the sororities partici
pated in the show. Most of the hosts 
and emcees were senior sorority 
members.
Greeks made up a large portion of 
the crowd. Junior Lisa Yanz, industri
al design major and Delta Gamma sis
ter, said she didnt mind paying for 
the ticket since the event was for 
charity.
We know some of the guys in the 
show, said Julia Zimmerman, a 
junior design major. Its fun to se a 
lot of them competing against each 
other in a beauty pageant.
A calendar featuring all 11 of the 
contestants and last years reigning 
champion was being sold at the showNguyen said tickets sold out the day 
before the event but standing tickets 
were still available at the door.
Geoffrey Plitt, a senior computer 
science major of Phi Kappa Theta, 
won the event.
Gas mask filters 
improved by CMU
CMU researchers in the microelec
trical mechanical (MEMS) lab were 
granted $190,000 by the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Preventions 
(CDC) National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH) to develop monitors that 
will reduce the cost of keeping respi
rator masks in top shape.
With the funding, the CMU team 
will create the technology necessary 
to alert users when respirator filters 
are reaching the end of their useful
ness and need to be replaced. Gajy 
Fedder, an associate professor of elec
trical and computer engineering, said 
the researchers are charged with dis
cerning the shelf life of cartridges 
used in gas masks. When the filters 
need replacing, they may no longer 
provide adequate protection against 
hazardous gases, fumes and vapors,
Although there has been a long
standing need for determining how 
best to monitor the lifespan of these 
cartridges, the need became even 
more prominent with the World 
Trade Center rescue and recovery 
effort, when respirators served as* a 
critical purpose for worker safety and 
health, said Richard Metzler, direc
tor of NIOSHs National Personal 
Protective Technology Laboratory. A 
monitor would set off an alarm if a-fil
ter cartridge was nearing the end,of 
its service life.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 18, 2002
CIT 3-2 program allows 
for MBA and BS in five
CIT, from page Al
said that there are many financial 
companies, such as Goldman Sachs, 
that recruit her students because 
they have a strong technical back
ground important in modern busi
ness. She said that having an MBA 
would greatly increase the students 
chance of getting a job. A similar 
program already exists within GSIA 
in which undergraduate business 
students can apply to a 3-2 pro
gram.
Unlike the proposed CIT pro
gram, business students are expect
ed to complete the undergraduate 
portion of their education before 
beginning the MBA program. 
Therefore, they bypass their senior 
year and graduate with their bache
lor and MBA degrees in five years. 
According to the course catalog, 
admission to the MBA program is 
highly competitive and 3-2 appli
cants compete with the entire appli
cant pool for spaces in the program.
John Robertson, director of the 
undergraduate business adminis
tration program, said, Typically 
half of the business students even
tually go on to get an MBA, but usu
ally after they receive work experi
ence.
He also acknowledged that while 
a handful of students apply to the 3-
2 program each year, one applicant 
has been admitted since 1995.
[The 3-2 program] is beginning 
to take on the status of myth or leg
end, said Robertson in a Tartan 
story last February on the crusade 
of business major Joshua Gerlick 
and his quixotic application to 
GSIA. Gerlick was accepted and cur
rently takes GSIA courses. It is 
impossible to predict whether engi
neering students in the MBA pro
gram will be more successful.
The GSIA Deans office declined 
any comment on the program pend
ing their official release of informa
tion, probably next week.Food poisoning cited in

ly after, and his case was forwarded 
to the homicide division of the citys 
investigations branch.
An autopsy performed on 
October 30 did not reveal the cause 
of death. Allegheny County deputy 
coroner Joe Dominick said that it 
could take up to eight weeks to 
receive the results of toxicology 
tests.
Pittsburgh homicide detective Jill 
Smallwood is currently investigat
ing the case as a suspicious death. 
She explained that all cases in 
which the cause of death is not 
immediately apparent to medical 
personnel is referred to her unit. 
Smallwood said that because of the 
lack of details about Zaidis death, 
her investigation will be difficult.
The University has not released 
any information about the death. 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy declined to comment, 
deferring to the family to release 
information. However, he said that
he has not had any contact with 
anyone in Zaidis family.
Anita Barkin, director of CMUs 
health center, declined to comment 
about Zaidis visit to Health Services 
and subsequent transport to UPMC.
Stehlik said that Zaidis sudden 
and unusual death is difficult for 
him to understand.
Its a tough thing to deal with ... 
He was the kind of guy youd like to 
argue about things with over a beer. 
It makes it that much harder, said 
Stehlik.
During his time at CMU, Zaidi 
was a strong student and a founding 
member of the Carnegie Mellon 
Debating Society. Zaidi enjoyed 
charcoal sketching, fiction writing, 
improv comedy, and DJing trance 
music.
A world-traveler, Zaidi had lived 
in the US, Pakistan, Australia, Saudi 
Arabia, and England and visited 
over a dozen other countries.
He was a very principled stu
dent, said Stehlik. He was a bright 
and personable guy.

/I think using our money, my par
ents money, to bring in known affili
ates of terror that continue to kill lit
tle kids and their mothers is appalling 
and irresponsible, said Alex 
Goldvug, a senior computational 
finance major and president of Hillel, 
the foundation for Jewish campus 
life.
The PLO is not included on the ter
rorist organization list that includes 
al Qaida; regardless, the CMU 
Activities Boards choice to bring 
Buttu in as a speaker aggravated 
many members of the community.
We find it alarming that the 
University would bring in someone 
connected with the PLO, that your 
student activities fees have helped 
support a terrorist organization, 
said David Terdiman, the director of 
Jewish University Center, echoing 
Goldvugs sentiments. Terdimans 
objection to Buttus lecture goes 
beyond mere funding issues. Like 
many other students, professors, and 
members of the Pittsburgh communi
ty, Terdiman finds Buttus message 
invalid and harmful.
I vehemently disagree with the 
content of what she said. The Israelis 
are working for peace and thats evi
dent in their previous efforts to work 
with Arafat. This is not ethnic cleans
ing, said Terdiman. She has the 
right to make a speech and be as 
effective as she is. The PLO is using 
her very well, unfortunately.
Such a distortion of history, 
events and facts  I wouldnt have 
believed it if I hadnt heard it. If they 
could give one example of the type of 
government that would support 
democratic ideals, Id like to hear it, 
said Paul Foreman as he exited the 
lecture. Foreman is studying history 
at the Academy of Lifelong Learning, 
a peer-taught, non-credit program 
through CMU.
However, many audience members 
were thrilled to have Buttu lecture at 
CMU. They found her speech elo
quent, enlightening, and necessary in 
Americas political climate.
It was obvious that she was slant
ed towards one opinion. But people 
need to hear that, because all we hear 
is the other bias, said Neema 
Moraveji, a first-year graduate stu
dent in HCI.
.' Some cheered and some cringed as 
Buttu urged the audience to diverge 
from Israel and support the 
Palestinian cause.
I I think her agenda is pure propa
ganda, and a learning university is no 
forum for propaganda, said 
Goldvug.
! She kept it factual, she was obvipusly educated. I thought it [the lec
ture] was fantastic, said Moraveji.
With constant threats to her life as 
proof, Buttu knows that her message 
is contraversial.
\ I get death emails all the time 
from Jews, she told The Tartan in an 
interview following her speech.
She said that the CMU audience 
Responded much more calmly to her 
words than others on her tour have, 
but that when her talks do induce 
heated and often angry debates, she 
i)s only more convinced in the impor
tance of her mission.
I like debunking a lot of the 
myths, she said, explaining why 
Speaking to an audience of vehement 
critics is often more fulfilling than 
speaking to crowds of adoring fans.
\ American audiences seem very 
Sympathetic to the cause, said Buttu.

This week was probably the 
worst week of the semester, said 
Director of Housing Tim Michael. 
Due to numerous staff changes, 40 
to 50 total hours were missed. Desk 
Services takes theses gaps seriously 
because policy dictates that 100 per
cent of shifts be covered. The ques
tion does not seem to be one of 
staffing, but rather of getting people 
to fulfill their responsibilities.
On paper, were full, said 
Michael. He said that more than 95 
percent of the desk budget of 
$249,000 goes to staff four desks, 
around the clock, for 30 weeks of 
the year.
With a pool of 80 desk attendants 
at an average of $9/hour, it would 
only take $181,440 to man the desks 
in Donner, Mudge, West Wing, and 
Morewood fully. Desks exist at these 
dorms because they have facilities 
for non-residents and/or communal 
female bathing areas, according to 
Michael.
Two years ago Housing Services 
reassessed desk attendant pay and 
decided on a significant increase in 
pay to $9 an hour for night shifts and 
even up to $20 per hour for recess 
periods like Thanksgiving and 
Spring Break.
Now the desks are filled until desk 
attendants do not meet up.
In theory, one desk attendant will 
not leave until they hand off the 
desk to the next person. However, 
sometimes students must leave a 
desk for class or miss their shifts.
Michael said they address this 
issue with a safety net of sorts. Desk 
attendants have an electronic bul
letin board they can use to find 
either a substitute for themselves or 
attendants who fail to relieve them. 
If an attendant cannot find a substi
tute when they must leave a desk, 
they can call a desk manager, who 
can then call Stephen Apanel,- grad
uate coordinator of Desk Services,
who can then call Michael himself.
Last week, Apanel attributed the 
40 to 50 open desk hours to the loss 
of staff to firings and to quitting due 
to academic pressures as finals 
approach.
This pattern will continue to hap
pen about three weeks before 
finals, said Apanel in an email to 
Michael.
The goal [during the pay 
reassessment] was 24-hour-staffed 
desks, said Michael. Now Housing 
has questioned whether the safety 
net is providing 100 percent, and 
holes remain. Current desk policy 
assumes unmanned desks when it 
prioritizes which desks are most 
important.
Morewood has priority over all 
others.
Michael said they are currently 
looking at putting two attendants at 
some of the busier shifts.
He said there might just be times 
when there is too much action for 
one attendant on top of assuring 
desk attendance, especially in places 
that hand out recreational equip
ment.
Michael said they are also looking 
into hiring people to stand by in case 
of an unmanned shift, and he wants 
to tighten up guidelines on desk 
attendants.
He said they just changed the 
three strikes policy for employee ter
mination, which resulted in about 10 
firings every semester, to two 
strikes.
Apanel is making a list of substi
tutes that attendants can contact if 
they need a replacement for one of 
their working days.
All of these measures aim to avoid 
more extreme measures.
We would always prefer to use 
students [as desk attendants], stat
ed Michael Murphy, dean of student 
affairs, in an email. To this end, we 
have raised that pay in recent years 
... if we were at a point where we 
simply couldnt fill those shifts, we 
would hire outside staff.
Housing Services has considered
hiring unionized security guards to 
monitor dorm entrances so they 
would not have to risk student 
employees missing shifts because of 
classes or other school-related activ
ities.
But Housing Services has avoided 
this last alternative since it would at 
least double their current desk 
expenditures. Michael explained 
that local security companies charge 
one to 1.3 million dollars a year for 
their services.
At other urban universities, stu
dents are not given the same free
dom to walk freely in and out of 
their dorms. At the University of 
Pittsburgh, security guards monitor 
heavily trafficked entrances. 
Columbia University students must 
pass through a series of doors so that 
desk attendants can verify that stu
dents belong in particular dorms 
and prevent tailgaters.
Here the duties of an attendant 
get muddled between handing out 
recreational equipment, selling 
laundry tokens, and looking at the 
ID of entrants. Michael said that 
desk attendants are required to look 
at IDs, but many times attendants 
are allowed to get away with not 
checking for students they are famil
iar with.
Michael said the goal is 100 per
cent of desks manned, but that he 
must assess the cost of capturing the 
remaining percentage to achieve the 
goal fully.
He estimated and told Murphy 
that about three to five percent of 
desk shifts are missed. Michael said 
he must assess the risk and cost 
involved in filling the three percent, 
because having more desk staff is a 
trade-off for other services, 100 per
cent policy or not. Housing operates 
on an independent $18 million bud
get. Increasing desk funds means a 
cutback in service or a rise in other 
prices, like the rent of the rooms 
being guarded.

StuCo loses 83 out of 206 studentsAccidents trouble weekend free-rolls
BUGGY, from page A1
student and new driver for Kappa 
Delta Rho (KDR) agrees.
They really care about their dri
vers. They treat us like goddesses, 
said Yuen, who thinks that she will 
continue to drive next year.
Michael Sperling, a first-year ECE 
graduate student, and the chairper
son of Phi Kaps buggy team, said 
that his organization and all other 
race teams he knows of make strong 
efforts to keep drivers safe.
They never go faster than they 
feel comfortable driving  wed 
never push them to go faster than 
they want to, said Sperling. 
Theyre our princesses of the 
house.
However, Sperling admits that 
buggy driving is a dangerous activi
ty, and that it is important for the 
drivers to be aware of the risks.
Were completely upfront with 
the drivers. Its like driving a car, a 
slight mistake and some unlucky cir
cumstances, and there you go, he 
said.
Sperling is thankful that Yoons 
crash only occurred at 25 mph, as
opposed to the 35-45 mph speeds 
that drivers reach by raceday.
It was extremely unlucky that 
the parking meter was there. You 
really cant do anything about com
ing to a stop with a matter of two 
inches, he said. Its your life. If 
youre made well aware of the risks, 
its fine.
Sperling says he would never 
attempt to influence Yoons decision 
of whether to continue driving.
Despite claims that buggy crashes 
do not result from negligence or 
recklessness, but are almost always 
freak accidents, some organizations 
seem to have worse luck than oth
ers. In 1999, three of four Phi Kap 
cars were disqualified or did not fin
ish. In 2000, Phi Kap failed a brake 
test following the race that disquali
fied them. In 2001, Phi Kaps A car 
spun out.
In 2002, Phi Kap didnt make it to 
the starting line in time.
Janice Golenbock, the chairper
son of 2003s Sweepstakes  the 
organization that oversees buggy  
says that this semesters accidents 
have all been unrelated and merely 
unlucky. The Sweepstakes website
a t
http://www. andrew. emu. edu/~bug ' 
gy/oldsite2/rules/safety.asp details 
over 3,000 words of safety regula
tions.
Golenbock is a first-year business 
graduate student, and has driven_ 
buggy for Fringe and been in three 
accidents over her career.
Brooke Abounadar, Sweepstakes 
safety chairperson, declined com-" 
ment on any of this semesters crash
es. Some students still maintain th - 
opinion that buggy is a dangerous 
activity.
It just doesnt seem very con
trolled. It definitely doesnt seem 
safe, said Jeneca Rangos, a junior 
BHA major, who has never driven 
for buggy and says she never would.
As one of CMUs oldest and most 
unique traditions, enthusiasm for 
buggy is strong despite the risks.' 
The retention rate for drivers is at 
around 75 to 80 percent, according 
to Brennan Sellner, a mechanic for 
CIAs buggy team.
Drivers return year after year 
because they genuinely enjoy it, 
said Matt Longnecker, chair of CIAs " 
team.

People these days do not make 
their own beer. Instead, most prefer 
to go out and buy a six-pack. For 
David Romberger, a senior music 
major, it is a different story. Brewing 
beer became his passion three years 
ago when he happened to come 
across instructions for homebrewing 
online. Now, with the help of Student 
College (StuCo), he will share his 
knowledge in the spring, with a class 
called Chemistry, History, and the 
Practicum of Homebrewing.
People are always asking me how 
I make my own beer, said 
Romberger. StuCo is a good way to 
teach those who really want to know. 
Its not just about making beer and 
drinking it; brewing is a serious 
endeavor that will require labs and 
some history.
Officially launched this semester, 
after the proposal failed for last 
semester, StuCo allows students to 
design and teach courses not found 
in the university curriculum. Topics 
range from bridge to modern jazz to 
the Greek way of war.
Peer institutions like Berkeley and 
Oberlin have similar programs. 
Berkeleys 22-year-old DE-Cal allows 
students to propose the course idea 
and syllabus; however, a sponsoring 
professor does the teaching. 
Oberlins 34-year old ExCo offers 50 
to 120 courses every semester, initi
ated and taught by students.
Because the 17 pass/fail courses 
for CMU this year make up a pilot 
program, the University Education 
Council (UEC) allows just one free 
elective unit for students and two for 
instructors. Students have expressed 
dissatisfaction, according to Ian 
Nieves, StuCo president and senior in 
software engineering. However, 
nothing can be done because StuCo is 
trying to legitimatize the program, 
he said.
This fall, many students dropped 
StuCo courses when they realized 
that the one unit did not reflect the 
workload. By mid-semester, 123 out 
of 206 students remained.
For Woody Allen: The Only Living 
Boy in New York, Mark Egerman 
said he designed his curriculum in 
line with the credit offering.
I read 14 books and did immense 
research during the summer just so I
K.C. Skedzielewki, a senior operations management major, adds malt as part of the 
preparation of his own home-brewed beer.
could cut down on the workload the 
students would have to do, said 
Egerman, a junior computer science 
major.
Its not fair to teach and require 
work as if it were a full course when 
its only worth one unit.
Students who have remained in 
StuCo tend to look beyond the acade
mic credit issue.
If it were about units I wouldnt 
take StuCo classes, said Alex 
Coellno, a mechanical engineering 
senior who takes Portuguese 
Language and Culture. Its like 
watching the Discovery Channel. I 
watch a documentary not because I 
have to but because Im interested. 
StuCo classes do not have lectures 
and recitations where students sit
and take notes; rather, students 
'actively participate in the work.
I came into Fun with Robots with 
no robotics background, said Alex 
McAuley, a junior German major. 
We first built a simple flashlight, but 
now Im building a robot to go 
through a maze.
As well as being engaging, the 
informal teaching environment is 
conducive to a relaxed atmosphere.
Its a weird combo to be a profes
sor and a peer but it works, said Erin 
Snyder, a senior physics and English 
major teaching Oscar Wilde. 
Students tell me when they hate a 
reading, they instant message me 
when they cant make a class. 
Overall, we get along and have a 
good time.

Sleeping bag weekend 
brings 400 high schoolers
Tentative blue light schedul
by Andrew Conklin
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon hosted close to 400 
high school juniors and seniors last 
weekend in its annual fall Tartan 
Express and sleeping bag weekend. 
Despite some hang-ups and miscommunication, most students and admin
istrators called the weekend successful 
and productive.
We had a few unforeseen events, 
but thats bound to happen with such a 
large group, said Nicole Ayala, assis
tant director of admissions and orga
nizer of sleeping bag weekends.
In fact, this weekends group was so 
large that the Admissions Department 
cut off registration one week early.
We filled up really fast, but we did
nt take more students than we could 
accommodate, said Ayala.
The weekend of November 9 also 
saw Tartan Express Weekend, an 
opportunity for prospective students 
from underrepresented minority 
groups to experience life on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
Black, Hispanic, and Native 
American high school students arrived 
on campus on Saturday, one day earli
er than other students, to a schedule of 
events and presentations tailored espe
cially for them, showcasing the experi
ences of minority students at Carnegie 
Mellon.
The Admissions Department also 
tried to recruit current minority under
graduates to host the students partici
pating in Tartan Express Weekend.
Only ten percent of our students are 
minority students, said Ayala, com
menting on the difficulty of matching 
the one hundred and fifty prospective 
minority students to minority hosts.
We eventually took care of it, 
though. I think we had five non-minor
ity students who hosted for Tartan 
Express, said Ayala.
Three hundred additional students 
arrived on Sunday for the official 
sleeping bag weekend.
We tried to match students with 
hosts by college of interest: wed put 
kids interested in business with a busi
ness major, CS with CS, and,so on, 
said Ayala. We were able to match up 
about eighty to eighty-five percent of 
the students by college.
Ayala said that prospective students 
gain a greater understanding of college 
life within their majors when their 
hosts are studying the same subjects. 
Sleeping bag weekend hosts agree.
I was very involved with my bag
ger, said Akil Simon, a first-year archi
tecture major who, along with his 
roommate, hosted two high school 
seniors interested in architecture and 
voice, respectively.
Simon took the student interested in 
architecture to studio to see the pro
jects of current architecture students, 
and tried to answer questions from the 
point of view of a student immersed in 
the Carnegie Mellon architecture com
munity.
Simon believed that the weekend 
went very well.
If there were any problems, it was 
that the baggers had trouble getting 
back into the room, said Simon, say
ing that guest students do not have 
keys and must rely on temporary iden
tification cards.
Also, baggers who were [high 
school] juniors were a little disrup
tive, said Simon, They treated this 
more like a weekend away than a 
learning experience.
Other hosts feel the same way about 
the disparity between the two classes.
The seniors were mostly really 
focused on getting as much informa
tion as possible, but the juniors were 
acting like they were on vacation. They 
kept asking about parties and drink
ing, said one first-year host who asked 
to remain anonymous.
One group of hosts felt that the 
Admissions Department must not 
match hosts up with students who are 
not interested in their major.
Were all drama majors, and they 
gave us a professional writing student 
and a business student, said Susan 
Heyward, a sophomore who hosted on 
sleeping bag weekend.
She explained that she and her 
roommates could not provide much 
guidance or information beyond gen
eral Carnegie Mellon data. The dispar
ity in majors also kept Heyward and 
her roommates from participating fully 
as hosts in the weekend, because they 
had no classes or functions of mutual 
interest.
I probably wouldnt be a host 
again, said Heyward, citing an 
increasingly busy schedule, as well as 
this years questionable assignment by 
the Admissions Department.
We understand the importance of 
matching students up by interest, and 
we do the best we can with the amount 
of hosts that we are able to recruit. The 
more people who want to host, the bet
ter we can match students up with the 
right college, said Ayala.

Crime network up, six blue lights coming
SECURITY, from page A1
ran with it, said Doyle. He also said Campus 
Police will change the way it tracks its own 
reports as well.
Currently, CMU has an outdated system that 
hinders effective analysis. White said the new 
Automated Record Management System or 
ARMS system, also used by Pitt, will let him find 
trends more easily.
He pointed out that under the current system, 
he has to specify a specific month to generate 
reports for, but the new system would let him 
look at something like a comprehensive list of all 
burglaries.
Doyle said the system, funded by an $18,000 
development grant from Bill Elliot, vice presi
dent of enrollment, was designed specifically for 
a college environment.
Doyle requested the software upgrade in 
January.
Security upgrades will not be limited to infra
structure, however. New blue lights should begin 
to pepper campus in December, and the escort 
service will add another van and driver.
Brian Namey [student body president] and 
Dan Gilman [vice president] made a strong case 
for the perimeter of campus, said Doyle. The 
chief gave an example of a student on their way 
home crossing the Junction Hollow Bridge in 
need of assistance.
Namey said they looked at the incidents that 
occurred on campus and tried to position phones 
where people in trouble could get help. 
Locations for six blue light phones include places 
like the edge of the Peace Garden where a rape 
occurred in October 2001 and by the parking 
garage entrance at Forbes Avenue and Beeler 
Street.
The installation of new lights will begin by 
December, according to Doyle. The project was 
originally slated to begin last fall, but funding
could not be arranged.
Namey said they plan to expand the blue lights 
as well. He said the University will retrofit exist
ing phones with blue lights and add lighted 
phones behind the new dormitory and 
Morewood Gardens. Also on the way for escort 
stops are signs and sidewalk markings.
The new escort driver and van come on the 
heels of increased student complaints of irregu
larity and overcrowding of vans, said Namey, 
though the route of the van is uncertain.
Our work on improving security isnt over, he 
said.
Namey said they continue to address dispatch 
problems with the escort service.
They face the dilemma of assigning an escort 
drivers too many distractions while he drives. If 
all proposals went through now, a driver would 
have to field phone calls on a handheld phone, 
call ahead to flash lights at escort stops, and use 
dial codes to make the lights continue to flash

Genetically modified foods and plants stir controversy
by Karen Hoffmann
Copy Staff
Americans have been eating 
genetically modified (GM) foods for 
seven years now, most of us 
unknowingly, for there is nothing 
new on the label to indicate any
thing different about these foods. 
Though there was initial popular 
support for a labeling measure in 
Oregon this past election, an almost 
$6 million advertising campaign on 
the part of Monsanto and other 
companies, focusing on the allege^ 
costs of labeling GM foods, defeated 
the measure in the end. Even the 
support of a Paul McCartney radio 
spot (Let it be labeled) could not 
save it.
Erin Upham, a senior chemistry 
and art major from Oregon, was sur
prised and disturbed by how many 
people voted against the measure 
(about three-fourths): Whether 
you agree with [GM foods] or not, 
you should at least know what
youre eating, she said.
There are two methods for adding 
a gene to a plant. First is via a bac
teria called Agrobacterium, which, 
after being modified with the 
desired gene, infects the plant, 
inserting its DNA.
Second is with a gene gun, 
which fires small metal pellets coat
ed with DNA solution containing the 
desired gene from a .22-caliber shell 
into the leaf of a plant, where the 
DNA will be incorporated into that 
of the plants.
People are understandably 
choosy about what they put in their 
bodies, Europeans seemingly more 
so than Americans. This affects peo
ple all over the world: Malawi, 
Mozam-bique, Lesotho, and 
Zimbabwe will only take GM corn as 
aid if it has been milled and cant be 
planted. Zambia, where millions of 
people are starving, has refused to 
accept even milled GM corn. These 
countries are worried about their 
exports to the European Union, 
which has tough restrictions on GM
foods.
Jonathan Minden, a genetics 
researcher in the Department of 
Biology, thinks such fears come 
from Europeans lingering mistrust 
of scientific officials in the wake of 
mad cow disease. They were told 
the meat was going to be fine. That 
made the people more anxious 
about anything scientists would say 
and so that led to anything that is 
said to be safe isnt gonna be safe. 
So theres a lot of mistrust and mis
understanding out there, said 
Minden.
Last Tuesday, the FDA ordered the 
destruction of nearly 500,000 
bushels of soybeans because they 
had come from a field containing a 
few stalks of leftover GM corn. Said 
Indira Nair, Vice Provost for 
Education and Engineering and 
Public Policy professor, That may 
be a disproportionate response. 
Minden called it silly.
Regardless of whether or not GM 
crops are dangerous biologically, 
they certainly have negative eco
nomic effects, like increasing farm
ers dependence on the companies 
that develop and patent the plants 
genetic code. The farmers cant save 
any of their crop for seed, but must 
buy seeds from the supplier compa
nies every year.
The increasing use of GM crops 
may seem to be inevitable. But 
there are alternatives, which may be 
better in the long run. For example, 
GM golden rice, containing vita
min A, is often touted as the solution 
to malnutrition among people 
whose staple food is rice. But mak
ing rice more nutritious doesnt 
change the fact that people are still 
only eating rice. An ideal solution 
would be to consume a variety of 
foods, including foods rich in vita
min A, said Nair.
On the question of GM foods safe
ty, there is a huge gap between sci
entists and non-scientists. Minden 
described an example from a BBC 
show about the pros and cons of GM

Jack offers solutions to irksome pop-up ads
by Jack Wu
Staffwriter
Dear Jack,
Whenever I sit down to use the 
Internet, I get a lot of web sites that 
pop up. They are really annoying 
because I didnt ask for them to come 
up. Sometimes if I close them, anoth
er one just pops up in its place. This 
really bugs me and I want to do some
thing about it. I heard that you can 
get a spam remover. If I can get rid of 
these dumb websites, how do I it? 
-May
Dear May,
Online spam is a really annoying 
aspect of computer life, isn't it? It 
shows the kind of world that we live 
in  in which we are continually 
molested with offers of eternal 
health, free gifts, and loads of 
money. There are ways to fight this 
online mass of advertisements, but 
it is not entirely foolproof. The level 
of spam protection that you want 
will depend on how much money 
you want to spend.
For starters, I recommend getting 
the free software Pow from 
AnalogX. You can get the software 
by going to www.download.com and 
searching for Pow in the In 
Downloads category. The software 
automatically closes any window 
that is on a block-list that you 
define. On a fresh install, you are 
given a small spam-block-list. As 
you come across spam popup-windows or any window that you per
manently do not want shown, you 
can add it to the spam-block-list. 
Pop-up windows from that specific 
site will not bother you again.
- To set up the program, down
load and install it from www. down
load, com.
- To test the program, go to 
www.howstuffworks.com or any 
website that pops up advertise
ments. You should see an advertise
ment window pop up. Right click on 
the Pow icon on your Windows sys
tem tray (bottom right hand of the
taskbar).
- Select Add/Delete Popup.
- You will see the Pow configura
tion window. It first tells you how 
many pop-ups you have blocked 
thus far. The first scrolling box 
shows you your spam-block list. 
Every site that you want to be 
blocked will be in this list. The bot
tom text area shows what browser 
windows you currently have open. 
To add a website to the spam-block 
list, double-click on the name of the 
window that you want to be 
blocked. So for example, lets say 
the popup window is an advertise
ment for X-Cam. You look at the 
title of the window, which is :: 
Amazing XCam2 ::. You then go to 
the Pow configuration window and 
in the bottom text area (which 
shows currently active browser win
dows), you double-click on :: 
Amazing XCam2 Now the 
Amazing XCam2 window is added 
to your spam-block list and it 
shouldn't bother you any more.
I recommend this software 
because it is simple and not intru
sive. As you will soon see, this may 
be a good or bad thing. Pow can 
only block sites that you have added 
to your list. And, if the name of the 
spam window changes, e.g., from 
:: Amazing XCam2 :: to
::::Amazing XCam2 :::: (note the 
addition of more colons), then Pow 
will not catch the new window and 
you will have to add that to your list 
as well. In terms of portability, Pow 
is very versatile. It takes up very lit
tle processing power and uses less 
than four megabytes of memory. If 
you are going to be setting it up on 
another computer (e.g. for a 
friend), you can export your blocklist to them so that they don't have 
to start from square one.
On another level of protection, 
you can use software that automat
ically blocks sites using a smart 
method. The software is called 
AdsGone Popup Killer Ad Stopper 
and it is available from www. down
load, com by searching for 
AdsGone. The software costs $19,
but has a 21-day free trial. There 
are more options included in 
AdsGone that may make the $19 
software fee worth it depending on 
the level of spam protection that 
you require. The setup of AdsGone 
is generally the same as Pow. You 
can define a block-list, but you can 
also define a white-list of sites that 
you allow to get through. AdsGone 
is good if you need more flexibility 
in your spam blocking software. 
Personally, I find AnalogXs Pow to 
be enough pop-up advertisement 
killing power. If you need my blocklist so that you dont have to start 
from scratch, just send me an email 
and Ill send you the block-list. 
There are many other add-on pro
grams that you can use to block 
advertisements, but I have found 
these two to be both highly utilitar
ian and user friendly.
There are also several web 
browsers like Mozilla (www.mozilla.org) and Opera (www.opera.com) 
that have built-in support for block
ing all popup ads.

Dear Jack,
I have a problem with emacs that 
has been bothering me for some time. 
I use emacs to edit Java programs for 
15-111 and whenever I open up a 
Java program with emacs, there is a 
 ^ M at the end of every line. It is 
really annoying because I dont need 
that to compile and it clutters up my 
program. Is there something I can do 
to get rid of these annoying things? 
-Ryan
Dear Ryan,
I had this problem for a while, 
too! This problem is common when 
you transfer files between comput
ers (most likely using FTP). How 
the problem occurs is that the raw 
format of your Java file includes 
^M characters at the end of each 
line as a formatting parameter so 
that the file knows that it should go 
to the next line. When you open up

Sonys Wild Arms 3 aims
by Tommy Newcomer
: Junior Staffwriter
Now, before this review gets going, 
Id like to get some things straight. 
First, I enjoy Halo, RalliSport 
Challenge, Soul Calibur It& II, and the 
Castlevania series. If youve played or 
heard of some of those, you know 
where I am coming from. Second, I do 
not like cute ponies and/or mermaids. 
On to the review.
Wild Arms 3 for the Playstation 2 
takes the player to a planet called 
Filagia, where old-style Western is the 
name of the game. Throw in some 
steam punk (think Wild Wild West, the 
movie), and youve got the feel of the 
game. Its quite cool, as magic is also 
thrown into the mix, providing many 
opportunities for odd and fantastic 
creatures, items, and locations. You 
! begin a story that follows a pack of four 
? drifters, the term used for roving 
nomads that seek freedom above all 
i else. You play each of the characters 
| individually as you learn the game in 
'the prologue, but once that is over, 
I look forward to a never-changing party 
g of four for the rest of the game.
; Environment and plot aside, the first 
j thing you may notice about the graph; ics is its use of cell-shading, which is an 
! attempt to mimic cartoons of old with 
'stark bright color/dark shadow con
trast. Its a love/hate thing, and Ive 
seen it done better (Jet Grind Radio, 
I for example). The bold outlines go a bit 
; over the top, and the bright colors start 
ito mess with your head after seventyi some-odd hours of game play, 
i The majority of the playing time will 
be spent doing one of three things:

Apple, Sun Microsystems, 
Lockheed-Martin, and IBM are 
names usually associated with 
Carnegie Mellon only through 
events on campus such as the 
Technical Opportunities Conference 
or company-sponsored seminars to 
which students flock for free food. 
But there is more to these compa
nies relationships with CMU than 
just resumes and hors doeuvres. 
These same companies are showing 
interest in what CMU does both 
inside and outside the classrooms of 
CMU West.
In 2001, the University estab
lished itself as an institution in the 
Silicon Valley area, a nexus for inno
vation and research in the high 
technology fields of aerospace, 
microprocessor design and software 
development. Carnegie Mellon West 
is located on former Navy base 
Moffett Field, on 15 acres of what is 
soon to become the NASA Research 
Park, an area anticipating the 
arrival of companies wanting the 
same opportunities and networking 
that CMU has access to. The people 
involved are an all-star team of soft
ware engineers, said James Morris, 
dean of the School of Computer 
Science (SCS).
Currently, a majority of the pro
grams graduate students educated 
at the campus are participating as 
part of a professionally-tailored 
education program built by CMU for 
companies such as LockheedMartin. Twenty-five of the 45 stu
dents enrolled at the west coast 
campus are employees of the aero
space giant. Large companies are 
targeted due to their ability to pay 
for education and for large projects 
involving team-based work, said 
Carol Hoover, director of planning 
and policy for the Institute for 
Software Research International 
(ISRI). ISRI provides software engi
neering education to both gradu
ates and undergraduates and con
ducts research into large-scale com
puter systems that rely on software. 
Ongoing Lockheed projects are 
turned into learning experiences for 
students, integrating business goals 
with education for those enrolled in 
the campus IT masters programs. 
Students are assigned projects deal
ing with technologies that are not 
necessarily ready for release into 
the general market, but rather com
prise the long-term goals of the 
company. Lockheeds Advanced 
Technology Center reviews the cur
riculum along with a representative 
from the production side of opera
tions and together they make sure 
that the program fits the needs of 
the company.
We get exposure to specific prob
lems companies are having ... and 
then we can transition new ideas 
and techniques [developed at the 
main campus] and tailor them so 
they can use these solutions, said 
Hoover. Research at the new cam
pus is driven by a grant of $23.3 mil
lion from NASA for the High 
Dependability Computing Project 
(HDCP). For five years, CMU will 
work in concert with other universi
ties such as the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and the 
University of Southern California.
See WEST, page A9
Overall 
the character, displaying any previous
ly unseen locations. Not only that, but 
certain events must be triggered for 
each location to even be visible by 
scanning. In addition, getting from 
place to place takes extreme patience, 
since you undoubtedly fight in innu
merable random encounters after 
walking as little as thirty paces on the 
world map.
Random encounters can be staved 
off to an extent if the new encounter 
(ECN) gauge is used intelligently. It 
allows you to stop random encounters 
as long as your gauge is full enough, 
but it subtracts some for each battle 
stopped. And boy, if you want to finish 
the game in this lifetime, you will need 
to stop as many battles as possible 
because combat takes forever.
The battle system used is graphically 
interesting, as the characters run 
around like in a real battle when not 
acting. And by real battle, I mean bat
tles between armies of headless chick
ens. Distance on the battlefield means
nothing with guns, and even melee 
attacks enable your characters to leap 
fifty feet towards their opponent to 
perform their attack. Also, if you 
havent played a Wild Arms game 
before, prepare for status effects 
galore. Nearly every enemy has some 
attack that does a status effect, which 
is produces a negative effect on your 
character that persists through battles 
unless cured. Cures are still as hard as 
ever to come by, as you must either rest 
in an inn or buy ludicrous amounts of 
healing potions and effect-healers.
Lastly, the cut-scenes and conversa
tions: while some parts of the plot are 
a bit predictable, there are a few twists 
and turns to keep things interesting 
throughout the game. However, be 
prepared for some odd translations 
and bad grammar, as this script defi
nitely missed the editor on the way 
out. The errors arent abundant, but 
they do pop up enough to break the

Teams from all participating univer
sities meet several times a year to 
exchange information on the 
progress of the research. NASA, Sun 
Microsystems, Apple, and HewlettPackard all sit in at meetings, 
expressing their keen interest on the 
progress of the research. Software 
giant Microsoft has also taken an 
interest in the work on software 
dependability.
The scope of CMU Wests involve
ment with industry goes beyond 
research or education. Formed in 
May, the Sustainable Computing 
Consortium (SCC) was assembled 
by SCS in cooperation with the 
Heinz School of Public Policy and 
Management.
The SCC was formed to address 
issues of software reliability and 
come up with new standards for 
development of these computer 
applications for the international 
community. One of the SCCs long
term goals is for people to be able to 
rely on software as much as any 
other product, bringing security to 
an industry known for bugs, patch
es, and crashes.
Research shows that defects in 
software cost businesses an estimat
ed $175 billion last year in lost pro
ductivity. The software industry has 
wrestled with reliability problems 
for years, wrote Wylie Wong in an 
article he wrote for C | NET News.com 
concerning the SCC. Companies 
such as Apple, General Motors, 
Mellon Bank, and insurance compa
ny AIG participate in the consortium 
and share information on their 
requirements for software, giving 
engineers a better idea of how to 
craft computing tools for these 
industries.
Possible future projects for CMU 
West may include implementing a 
mission data system for NASAs Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory. When imple
mented, the mission data system 
will make satellites and interplane
tary probes more modular and 
cheaper in design and use real-time 
Java to do so. Sun Microsystems has 
even brought in James Gosling, co
founder of Java, to work on the pro
ject. CMU West also plans to expand 
the educational programs to include 
NASA, and possibly Boeing.

who were talking on the con side, it 
was all these rich, upper-class 
women who were worried about 
the quality of the foods theyre get

stores, and the people who were for 
genetically modified food were the 
scientists who had done the experi

gy-So what can be done to bridge the 
gap? Carnegie Mellon University 
tried to have such a dialogue in its 
panel discussion about the Miller 
Gallery exhibit Paradise Now: 
Picturing the Genetic Revolution, 
on which Minden was the lone sci
entist.
Minden thinks there need to be 
more such events, and also more 
education, starting with the media.
It starts with what we teach our 
kids, particularly on TV. If you look 
at regular TV programming and 
what people are getting, its always 
the hysteria, its all sort of tabloid 
TV ... if there were more shows like 
Nova and Scientific Frontiers, people 
would have a general interest and 
understanding of science. But every 
time you see a scientist on TV or in 
a movie, theyre either a doofus or a 
bad person, which makes me feel a 
little defensive about what I do, 
said Minden.
Upham feels that the companies 
that make GM foods ought to edu
cate people about them. Also, Nair 
says that researchers can do their 
part to help by explaining the facts. 
Scientists can face up to and com
municate the uncertainties and 
benefits clearly, not just say that 
people who have fears are foolish or 
ignorant, she said.

mood sometimes. Also, I was sur
prised by the lack of depth in the writ
ing, finding that most of the conversa
tions can be breezed through fairly 
quickly.
Though bleak, there is some hope 
for Wild Arms 3. There are enough 
interesting elements in the game to 
keep most die-hard RPG junkies 
going, one of which is the Sand 
Cruiser. In order to cross certain sec
tions of the world map, you will need 
to acquire one of these vehicles, and 
once you do, it provides a plethora of 
customizing and tweaking options for 
all you mod-happy people out there.
However, batiles in a cruiser take 
almost five minutes at a minimum, so 
there is a dark cloud to this silver lin
ing.
Wild Arms 3 left me feeling a bit 
vacant, like I was missing out on 
something. The potential was there: 
the world has a great feel, the story 
isnt something to sneeze at, and 
theres a unique cell-shading feel. The 
problem lies in the execution. I felt 
like I was always trying to get to a 
more interesting point in the game, 
instead of feeling like every moment 
was interesting. But there are those 
interesting points, and they almost 
make up for a game that tries to do 
too much.

To stop this, you have to transfer

Transferring in ASCII format will

CMU staff deserve the same 
child care benefits as faculty
Any administrator would want Carnegie 
Mellon to be a unified community that 
embodies learning and collaboration.
No matter how you describe the stu
dents, staff, and faculty  undergraduate 
or graduate, Dining or Housing, computer 
science or history, adjunct or tenured  
there exists a culture of partnership 
between these parties. But a deep chasm 
mars the idealistic administrators vision 
of thousands working as one: a parental 
leave policy that all but prohibits staff 
from retaining a job and starting a new 
family.
Like any other business, the University 
offers benefits packages to its employees. 
But it has neglected staff in this regard. 
Most prominently, the current parental 
leave policy for staff members is inade
quate. While faculty can enjoy a semester 
of paid leave to begin parenthood, staff 
must store regular vacation days and bank 
sick days to achieve a smaller amount of 
leave.
Essentially, faculty can have kids when
ever they want, but staff better start plan
ning years in advance. The school justifies 
its policy by claiming faculty must keep up 
in the tenure process. Tell that to a family 
expecting a child, still slaving away just to 
make ends meet. There are inherent dif
ferences between faculty and staff, and 
how they are compensated by their 
employer. But employers should not, 
directly or not, curtail the freedom of a 
person to start a family and raise children.
The disparity between staff and the 
University community is even more appar

What kind of appreciation did Carnegie

which CMU has divested to Parkhurst and 
Central Property Services (CPS). And 
CMU could easily move Facilities 
Management Services (FMS) workers, 
who are current University staffers, to CPS 
or another third party.
CMU must not hypocritically deny com
munity services to any staff member. We 
trust all of our workers to labor within the 
dorms, to walk the same hallways we do. 
As much as professors or students make up 
CMU, so do these staff. Staff should all be 
encouraged to make use of all health and 
learning facilities on campus, rather than 
being corralled out of them.
Perhaps the University needs to look at 
their policies in another light. CMU says 
we dont want janitors in our library unless 
theyre mopping the floors. If we really 
want a diverse campus, maybe we should 
stop segregating people based on their 
bank accounts. CMU needs to take a look 
at the example it sets when it deprives its 
people, high or low on the totem pole.
The University can cite financial reasons 
for outsourcing its workers. Nonetheless, 
CMU must make sure that the organiza
tions with which they consort live up to 
University ideals. CMU must monitor 
Parkhurst and CPS if they consider their 
divestments prudent. The recent contro
versy between Parkhurst and its employ
ees has illuminated the need for constant 
University vigilance.
But then again, isnt the University just 
setting an example for Parkhurst to fol
low? How can we expect Parkhurst to treat 
its employees fairly if CMU cant do the 
same for their employees?

unnoticed. But who is responsible for this 
lack of interest in on-field success; the stu
dents who are supposed to make up a 
rabid fan base or the administration who 
should react accordingly to student senti

The answer is both. The type of individ
ual that studies at CMU is not solely inter
ested in on-field glory, and rightfully so. It 
was Carnegie Tech president Robert 
Doherty who de-emphasized football  
much to the chagrin of the students and 
alumni  after the Tartans Sugar Bowl 
appearance in 1937. He cited the adverse 
impact on academics that top-level foot
ball had. But he may just as well have 
observed that collegiate athletics was 
becoming more like professional sports.
Today there is little appreciation from 
the University for the ingenuous spirit of 
athletics. Consider the shoddy treatment 
afforded the club baseball team that wish
es to obtain varsity status. Open a web 
browser and navigate to the Carnegie 
Mellon athletics website  anyone will be 
hard-pressed to find another university 
athletics website that offers less updates 
and game information.
Surely the school does not think our 
institution is in danger of placing too 
much emphasis on athletics. Why then the 
apathetic position of Warner Hall? It is a 
riddle of a question that we do not know 
the answer to.
But we do know Carnegie Mellon should 
treat all its accomplishments with equal 
respect and honor.

Spread the wealth to 
foreign students
Dear Editor,
I am writing to comment on an article I 
recently read in The Tartan regarding CMUs 
policy of not providing financial aid to inter
national students (Impact of zero intl 
financial aid unknown, 10/14/02).
As a CMU alumnus trying to help build a 
company abroad, this article is very disturb
ing to me. Not providing financial aid to 
international students is inexcusable and 
works as a clear disadvantage for those of us

in Cubans, 
US must lift 
embargo
On Tuesday, November 12, the Cuban 
government agreed to open its doors to 
American scholars and academics who hope 
to preserve the works of one of this coun
trys great literary minds. It doesnt take a 
genius, however, to see that the obstacles 
put in place by the US government towards 
Cuba  namely a 40-plus-year economic 
embargo and travel ban  prolonged this 
venture for an inexcusable period of time. 
Cuban president and dictator Fidel Castro 
OKed the project to preserve thousands of 
documents and artifacts from Ernest 
Hemingways Finca Vigia estate after nearly 
two years of legal wrangling by interested 
parties both here and on the Caribbean 
island. Under the terms of the agreement, 
Hemingway preservationists and scholars 
from the US and Cuba will be able to trans
fer reams of material laying untouched in 
the authors basement onto microfilm and 
digital media where it will thereafter be col
lected in a massive database in Bostons JFK 
Library.
Until last week, American academics and 
literati interested in the nine-acre estate in 
San Francisco de Paula, Havana, could only 
petition the islands National Heritage 
Council, the Social Science Research 
Council, or Castro himself. Some, like the 
late Hemingway biographer and scholar 
Michael Reynolds, who wrote an eminently 
readable series on the authors life, were tar
geted by FBI agents who had intercepted a 
number of petitions of Reynolds to the 
Cuban government requesting access. But, 
thanks to the dogged efforts of Reynolds 
and like-minded Americans, fans of the 
author stateside finally have an opportunity 
to discover some personal affects, in the 
form of annotated pages from favorite 
books, and a few spectacular finds, like a 
rejected epilogue to the seminal Spanish 
Civil War tome For Whom the Bell Tolls.
However, due to an outdated and 
immoral policy of travel and trade proscrip
tions, average folk like myself have little 
chance of visiting Havanas Hemingway 
Museum, the fishing vessel Pilar, or the 
Finca Vigia grounds without federal eyeballing. Call it the Papa principle  the 
Cuban embargo enacted in 1960 hurts 
American interests, foreign investment, and 
withholds valuable assets (read: US tourist 
cash) from the Cuban people. The 
Hemingway case is only a small example of 
a much larger problem. By sticking to a pol
icy of economic isolation, we are only giving 
Castro and his fellow oligarchs grist for their 
imprecations against the United States, 
meanwhile choking off any chance at true 
I market reform in Cuba.
trying to establish ourselves abroad. By bot
tlenecking the flow of highly qualified inter
national students to Carnegie Mellon, the 
school is limiting its future presence in the 
very communities that will fuel the bulk of 
opportunity and innovation going forward.
Lets be honest. There is little differentia
tion in college education today. We all use 
the same books; none of the knowledge 
from the classroom is proprietary (one plus 
one will always equal two). However, this 
backwards financial aid policy will erode 
the only real proprietary thing we potential
ly have, our alumni network. Who cares if

Since 1960, normal Americans have been 
barred from trading with, investing in, or 
traveling to Cuba. Following the communist 
takeover in 1959, the United States called 
for an economic isolation to tamp down a 
possible national security threat. With the 
Cold War raging, American officials claimed 
Cuba was a Soviet proxy in the Western 
Hemisphere. A communist redoubt in the 
Caribbean, it was argued, could foment revWhen President Bush

olution in any number of South or Central 
American governments, resulting in a spate 
of countries actively colluding with the 
Russians. But the Cuban government has 
not posed a serious risk to the US since 
1962s Missile Crisis. And yet, 40 years 
hence, American officials still hold stead
fastly to an economic embargo more delete
rious than the one levied upon Iraq, that 
axis of evil member state, under current 
Bush administration guidelines. Whats 
more, in 1998 the US Defense Intelligence 
Agency reported that Castros 43-year-old 
regime does not pose a significant military 
threat to the US or to other countries in the 
region. The Soviet empire collapsed in 
1991, and with it its communist satellites

President Bush reiterates that the embargo

reach of its alumni network no matter how 
you justify it. You can argue that this is a 
very subjective comparison, but I have seen 
this firsthand outside of the US.
Overall, my time at CMU was a positive 
one that I won't forget. However, going for
ward, I hope CMU does not force us alumni 
working abroad to succeed in spite of our 
school. I never knew about this policy 
beforehand. What I do remember is that

is a necessary part of US foreign policy 
towards Cuba, he is simply fanning the 
flames of an old conflict long past.
Part of the current argument in favor of 
sanctions states that the Cuba embargo is 
somehow designed to help the Cuban peo
ple. This brand of tough love, ironically, 
has been pushed for years by a small yet 
vocal minority of Cuban expatriates living in 
Miami and other parts of Florida. They and 
their lobbyists in Washington claim that 
only through trade bans and economic sanc
tions can the US ever expect to produce a 
democratic transition in Castros regime.
However, these Cuban-Americans tend to 
speak out of both sides of their mouths, 
preaching isolationism yet sending home 
over $800 million a year in remittances to 
friends and family. Average Americans, like 
Reynolds, are greeted with a federal inter
diction if they attempt such a trick. Instead 
of changing things for the Cuban people, the 
US government continues to impoverish 
them while it lines the pockets of Castro, his 
brother Raul, and other senior communist 
party officers. If we have learned anything 
from similar situations like Haiti, it is that 
economic sanctions subsidize tyrants like 
Aristide, forcing desperate citizens to flee 
their country for US shores, only to be 
turned back at gunpoint by Coast Guard 
speed boats because they do not qualify for 
political asylum. Like the UNs 661 
Committee on Iraq, named after the oil-forfood sanction of the same name, President 
Bush and his trade deputies are committing 
far greater crimes with embargoes  in 
Cuba or elsewhere  than are the regimes 
theyre attempting to unseat.
What the Papa principle illustrates so 
clearly is that American business, indeed 
any foreign investment, is unfairly singled 
out and circumscribed because of this 43- 
year-old economic relic. In addition to shirk
ing World Trade Organization commitments

One of the more peculiar events of the 
Industrial Revolution in England is the story of 
Ned Ludd. Today we recognize the term 
Luddite as someone who simple-mindedly 
fights technology and scientific progress. It 
should be noted that whether Ludd himself 
existed or not is a matter of historical dispute. 
Nonetheless, a movement was organized in his 
name, spreading rapidly throughout England 
and finding a core of laborers unhappy with the 
increasing mechanization of their jobs. What 
resulted was the systematic destruction of 
many textile mills and industrial machines. 
Why do I bring up this bit of history now? Well, 
it seems to me that the Democratic Party, which 
tries to bill itself as progressive, is in danger of 
becoming the Luddite Party.
While I have disagreed with liberal dogma in 
previous columns, the current problem facing 
Dems is less about ideology than about policy. 
The simple fact of the matter is that they are out 
of ideas. This is especially true on the matters 
that now concern Americans most  national 
security and the economy, both of which have 
been traditionally Republican issues. If Dems 
are to make any progress in elections, if they are 
to take the offensive, they must start playing on 
Republicans turf.
The list of GOP accomplishments and goals 
should make clear why the American people 
want conservatives running the legislature. 
Republicans have proposed initiatives in educa
tion such as school vouchers and charter 
schools. On the environment, Republicans cre
ated pollution credits that companies can buy 
and sell, reducing pollution at a much lower 
cost than straight out regulation. An issue like
ly to be discussed this legislative term is the cre
ation of private Social Security accounts, so 
that workers can decide for themselves what to 
do with their retirement money.
Whether you agree with these ideas or not, 
they are all original, small government solu
tions to the social problems that the Democrats 
have usually been most trusted on. Republicans 
have the advantage of the free market, which 
generates a great number of new ideas that can 
be made into government policy. But instead of 
attaching these ideas to problems they claim to
care about most, Dems have instead attacked 
viciously, opposing a number of key measures. 
This simplistic opposition to progress is the 
greatest threat facing them; in a reform-mind
ed America, they are quickly becoming the anti
reform party, the Ned Ludd Party.
Democrats have not been able to match 
Republicans in the battle for new ideas. Instead, 
they continually return to the old line: If it 
moves, tax it; if it still moves; regulate it; and if 
it stops moving, subsidize it. The party stands 
for nothing more than high taxes, big govern
ment, and sucking the brains out of unborn 
children.
As the The Economist pointed out this sum
mer, Opposition usually provides parties with 
a chance to recharge their intellectual batter
ies.... Nowadays you only have to compare the 
neo-conservative Weekly Standard with the leftish American Prospect to realize that intellectual 
excitement in Washington remains on the 
Right.
Especially on the war on terror and the econ
omy, Democrats have to offer something fresh. 
Stalling the creation of the Department of 
Homeland Security without a doubt led to the 
defeat of Senator Max Cleland in Georgia. 
Having two Congressmen fly to Baghdad to 
denounce President Bush hurt their election 
chances more than anything Richard Gephardt 
ever did.
Democrats have half-heartedly supported the 
war and offer no alternative to the war on ter
ror. Which prompts voters to ask why they 
should want the Republican-lite variety instead 
of the real thing. On the economy as well, Dems 
attack the President on his economic leadership 
without a plan of their own.
Other than John Edwards proposal to raise 
taxes, which is, of course, the dumbest thing 
you can do in a recession, Democrats have noth
ing. They are unwilling, as are some 
Republicans, to cut spending and lower taxes. 
Even if the economy tanks, Democrats must still 
have a logical proposal in 2004 if they are to 
retake power.
Kid stuff: when parents behave badly, children have no fun
.dmHimrI BK OTHim2e
Like those of you who disagree with me, Im 
sometimes amazed that I can chew gum and 
walk at the same time. Looking back at my 
childhood and how my parents raised me, its a 
miracle Im not selling fries at McDonalds.
My parents did none of the things good 
parents do today. They didnt fight to get me 
into the right preschool. They didnt buy the 
latest and greatest educational toys for threemonth-olds, namely because they probably 
wouldnt have been able to afford them had 
they even existed. And they were completely 
ignorant of the fast track I should have started 
at the age of two months. My parents had the 
foolish idea that a kid should be a kid.
Perhaps some of our younger readers experi
enced the cusp of this new trend in child rear
ing. To make sure that children have successful 
productive lives, parents have to make sure 
their children get into the right college. To do 
that, they have to make sure their kids get into 
the right high school. Obviously, that doesnt 
happen without the proper junior high school, 
elementary school, preschool, and pre
preschool. And dont forget that their little 
angels have to meet or beat milestones like 
.crawling, walking, and talking.
God forbid your baby should learn to crawl 
at 10 months instead of the average age of 
nine months. Put on the fast track to becoming
a corporate drone, children are being raised in 
a world where they cant be kids.
Take tummy time for example, the latest 
craze among parents. Since doctors started 
recommending putting infants to sleep on 
their backs to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant 
Death Syndrome, some experts have claimed 
that kids need more tummy time. Toy compa
nies have jumped on the bandwagon, making 
new toys that help kids with tummy time. 
And some parents now stress over their infants 
who dont seem to like tummy time. A recent 
article in The Wall Street Journal quoted par
ents fretting over the fact that their infants 
didnt seem to like it.
Any good pediatrician will tell you that 
tummy time is important. By placing an infant 
on his or her stomach for a small period of 
time, a parent helps the child develop the mus
cles necessary to hold the head up. 
Additionally, this practice can help a child 
learn to crawl. However, the parents seemed to 
be forcing it on their kids with extended peri
ods of time and developmental toys.
From there on, things get worse. Pre
preschools and preschools are the rage now. 
Consider Jack Grubman, the analyst at 
Salomon Smith Barney who altered his rating 
on AT&T, allegedly to help win influence in 
getting his two twins into the posh 92nd Street 
Y nursery school in New York.
This school only accepts a small percentage
of applicants and only allows 300 applications 
per year. To apply, you have to attend a tour 
which can only be scheduled starting the day 
after Labor Day. Other fancy schools in New 
York are like this, forcing parents to jump 
through hoops in order to land a spot in the 
hopes Junior will one day make it to Harvard.
To help them, parents even enlist the ser
vices of consultants for getting into preschools. 
These preschools and nurseries even interview 
children. Such a concept is ridiculous. How 
can Barney or Sesame Street make for good 
interview topics?
Looking at all this, I always wonder where 
the children fit into things. Whatever hap
pened to things like learning songs, sharing 
toys, and participating in show and tell? What 
happened to games, nap time, and finger 
painting?
This is not to say that such elite facilities do 
not do this. They do. But everything seems to 
be geared towards getting a child to the next 
elite school or passing some admissions inter
view. We seem to be putting children under 
enormous pressure without any regard for 
their creative or personal development.
I used to think that this was just some dys
functional behavior of the rich. After all, when 
youve got a lot of money, wealth, and power, 
the only direction your heirs can go is down. I 
can see the rich and powerful paranoid 
about their kids not doing as well as someone
else. Now, however, this behavior includes 
boomer parents.
No one, of course, wants anything less than 
the best for their kids. My wife and I placed a 
lot of weight on school districts when we 
bought our house. We also make sure that we 
buy some toys that tend to encourage whatev
er talents our kids have. However, we dont fret 
if one of our children isnt attending the best 
pre-preschool in the area or isnt crawling, 
walking, or talking four months ahead of 
schedule.
I could go on forever with examples showing 
how parents want to raise the perfect child: 
ubiquitous use of drugs like Ritalin to control 
behavior, schools eliminating recess to cram in 
more educational time, hectic schedules that 
define every minute of a childs life so they can 
all the checkboxes checked to get into college, 
and the frightening lack of free time for undi
rected play.
These neurotic parents can raise their kids 
as they see fit, I guess. As for me, Id rather 
raise a couple of boys who do what interests 
them, understand the value of creativity, and 
know that what preschool you went to doesnt 
mean squat.

The Ned Ludd Party needs to offer an alter
native, not just denounce everything the Bush 
administration does.
In the end, ideas are what matter. Democrats 
need new policies, especially on matters such as 
national security. Liberal think-tanks must pro
pose creative solutions to problems. Otherwise 
the Dems will be fighting a defensive battle, 
and losing the war.
America is changing, demographically, eco
nomically and ideologically. If the Democrats 
are to survive as a party, if they are to bring any
thing to the table other than more taxes and 
regulation, they must shed their simplistic 
opposition to change.
Voters are too smart for the shrill Ned Ludd 
routine year after year. And if they dont find a 
new act, Democrats will not be a serious party 
for much longer.

Biotech food 
can help, 
not hurtEMBARGO, from page AIOAmerica. More precisely, Castros 
regime is the last true dictatorship 
left in the Western Hemisphere. The 
embargo against the Cuban people 
has produced nothing  a tyrant is 
still in power, outlasting nine presi
dents; no free or fair elections have 
been allowed since the communist 
takeover; human rights are virtually 
non-existent; and average citizens 
are denied property rights and mar
ket liberalization through the unin
tended consequences of an immoral 
and benighted trade measure. 
Chinas gradualist reforms are a 
stark reminder of how political free
doms inevitably follow economic 
ones, thanks to their WTO member
ship in November 2001. And a travel 
ban on Cuba  one that does not 
include axis of evil members Iran 
or North Korea, by the way  is a 
hypocritical inconsistency from 
President Bush that merely 
strengthens Castros hand in the 
region rather than weakens it.
In the opening pages of For Whom 
the Bell Tolls, Hemingway repeats 
John Donnes famous quip, No man 
is an island unto himself. Well, in 
2002, Cuba is most assuredly an 
island unto itself, representing no 
threat to American interests. Its 
time for Bush and Cuban-Americans 
to tone down their protectionist 
rhetoric and allow for the market of 
ideas to put down Castro and his 
junta once and for all.
because of national security con
cerns, the US government goes so 
far as to write the trade policy of for
eign competitors like Canada and 
Russia. The Helms-Burton Act, also 
known as the Cuban Liberty and 
Democratic Solidarity Act, was 
passed in 1996 and states in its dubi
ous Title III provision that any foreign-owned company may be pun
ished for the wrongful trafficking 
in property confiscated by the 
Castro regime. What this means is 
that any foreign investor or industry 
found importing Cuban wares or 
exporting their own will be subject 
to penalties such as having their 
assets frozen. All this from a govern
ment and administration that 
mechanically trumpets the benefits 
of free trade whenever allowed a 
venue to do so.
According to the US International 
Trade Commission, the Cuban 
embargo costs American firms 
between $684 million and $1.2 bil
lion per year. How about letting pri
vate financing from commercial and 
fiduciary institutions assume some 
of that business, along with the cash 
supplements of American tourists 
purchasing glassware and Cuban 
cigars? As a matter of sound trade 
policy for the US and its allies, the 
Helms-Burton Act should be 
allowed to sink to the bottom of the 
money bog when it comes up for 
renewal next year.

01 In a little over a week from now, 
when youre sitting at the
Thanksgiving table, looking at the 
juicy turkey, fresh vegetables, and 
tasty pies, what are you going to be 
thinking about? Probably not the fact 
that over two thirds of the food youre 
about to consume has
genetically-modified ingredients. 
Many people would argue that foods 
Should be marked if they contain 
genetically-modified ingredients. 
Others hail the genetic revolution as 
the panacea of starvation around the 
world. But neither fairly explains the 
use of genetically-modified food. 
Genetically-modified food means 
agricultural crops that have altered 
genes to make them more immune to 
pests, frost, and other damaging fac
tors. And there are still more advan
tages such as more food production 
and sturdier food.
The media informs and inflates dis
advantages rather than the factual 
advantages. Movies such as Mission 
Impossible 2 and Gattaca put genet
ic-engineering on trial, if not crucify 
it. In this environment, the public can 
hardly escape fictional prejudices 
containing no scientificfoundation 
about genetically-modified foods. 
Genetically-modified foods may not 
be completely safe; there might be 
side effects.
However, instead of fearing this 
new science, we should invest time 
and money to research it. Stanford 
University biotech expert Virginia 
Walbot told The New York Times last 
year, The way Thomas Edison 
-'demonstrated how great electricity 
was, was by providing lights for the 
first nighttime baseball game. People 
' were in awe. What if he had decided 
to demonstrate the electric chair, 
instead? Would we have electricity 
today? The point is the acceptance of 
scientific discoveries takes time, but 
the way this new knowledge is pre
sented is crucial.
" Unfortunately, governments spend 
more time regulating
genetically-modified food rather 
than investigating or explaining it.

anxious public feel safe. In the end, 
money and time will be wasted.
Genetically-modified foods pro
vide countless advantages. According 
to San Francisco Chronicle, U.S. 
farmers could pocket as much as an 
extra $1 billion, while cutting pesti
cide use, if an array of biotech crops 
currently in development is approved 
by regulators and adopted by farm
ers. They reduce the pressure to turn 
wilderness into farmland and provide 
hope that we can keep up with the 
nutritional demands of a hungry and 
growing world.
Our natural resources cannot sup
port everyone and in order to pre
serve life, genetically-modified food 
is the best alternative. It does use less 
land and substantially increases 
farming productivity. Also, genetical
ly-modified foods are sturdier, espe
cially in rough climates like subSaharan Africa, where more food is 
needed amidst drought conditions 
and pandemic starvation.
have signed off as well.
Those hidden, long-term harms 
we constantly hear repeated are para
noid fears Americans hold about any 
number of food products, natural or 
modified.
So do we care about hungry people 
or are we all just politicians? In 
Africa, governmental organizations 
such as the Organization of African 
States (OAS) and New Partnership 
for African Development (NEPAD) 
reject genetically-modified food even 
if it means starving the life out of 
their own people.
The citizens of some African states 
have two choices: accept their gov
ernments decision and slowly starve 
to death or fight their government 
and die quickly fighting against gov
ernment troops. For example, the 
Chicago Sun reported on October 30, 
Zambia, where 3 million people are 
facing food shortages, has rejected 
thousands of tons of free corn from 
the United States because some of it 
is genetically modified.
Zambia is worried that accepting 
engineered products might harm 
budding European demand for its 
produce, in particular organic vegeta
bles. In November 2001, Zambia 
entered a state of emergency and 
finally let UN Food Programme give 
genetically-modified food to their 
citizens but would not allow other 
nations or groups to support their
For instance, Oregon tried to pass a 
state initiative, Measure 27, requiring 
all genetically engineered food to be 
labeled as such. Granted, people 
should know the substance of the 
food they eat, but to have lobbyists 
spend over 5.2 million dollars on 
campaigning against Measure 27 is 
simply ridiculous. That money could 
have been spent researching genetically-modified food before making 
legal decisions about it.
There has been no case showing 
that genetically-modified food harms 
people. Around two thirds of the food 
we eat contain genetically-modified 
ingredients, which means that if 
some products were harmful in the 
short run, high-profile cases would 
surely have emerged already.
Dean Kleckner, chairman of Truth 
About Trade and Technology and a 
former president of the American 
Farm Bureau, explains in The Wall 
Street Journal, Weve been eating 
this stuff for years, and theres not a 
shred of scientific evidence showing 
that biotech foods are anything but 
perfectly safe to eat. The Department 
of Agriculture, the Food and Drug 
Administration and the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
regulate GM foods  and each has 
endorsed them as fit for the market.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 18, 2002
Football 
loses to UR, 
ends streak
FOOTBALL, from page A14
the CMU 43. Three more passes spot
ted the Yellowjackets just outside the 
10 yard line. Two plays later, Manuel 
floated the ball in the far right corner 
of the end zone. When the ball 
slipped through the hands of the 
CMU defender, Brian Ferris caught 
his third touchdown pass of the 
game.
We didnt cover anybody [today], 
said Lackner. We made their quar
terback look like Terry Bradshaw.
- Manuel completed over 63 percent 
of his passes and threw one intercep
tion. His main target was wideout 
Ferris, who had 165 yards receiving 
and three touchdowns for the day, 
'including the final score that put 
Rochester ahead for good.
The Tartans made one last gasp 
with 1:28 remaining, opening with a 
16-yard reverse by wideout Chris Kay. 
On 3rd and 10, Urbanczyk took a sur1 prise handoff to the Rochester 46- 
yard line. Sophomore quarterback 
Jarrod Highberger then found Kay in 
single coverage for a 15-yard comple
tion. The season ended when 
1 Higherbergers next pass attempt, 
intended for running back Drew 
Garrod, was tipped and intercepted 
at the 13-yard line by Rochester line
backer Jeff Leslie.
It was the second Tartan turnover 
of the day. Leading 28-17 in the 
fourth quarter and driving into 
Rochester territory, the Tartans 
Stanley fumbled, which was possibly 
the games most costly error.
With their 27-consecutive-year win 
streak snapped and 26 seniors gradu
ating, some Tartan players looked 
towards the programs future.
I love all these seniors, said 
senior quad-captain Sebastian 
Smelko. This is the largest senior 
class to ever come through. But the 
sun comes up tomorrow and the 
younger guys, they have a lot of heart 
and determination. Theyll probably 
be in the weight room on Monday, 
getting ready for next season.
The Tartans finish with a 5-5 
record, a 1-3 conference mark, and a 
bevy of what-ifs that must be hashed 
out come off-season.
With two weeks remaining on the 
year, the Tartans had the opportunity 
to tie for the UAA title  which 
would have been their eighth of 
Lackners tenure.
Instead they are tied for last place 
in the UAA. Their company at the bot
tom? The University of Rochester.
Mens soccer defeated in NCAAs
SOCCER, from page A14
Carnegie Mellon had three more 
chances in the 10 minutes before 
intermission, with Rust blocking 
another free kick, and shots from 
sophomore midfielder James 
Steidel and Hibshman missing just 
left and just right of the Otterbein 
goal, respectively.
Sophomore midfielder Mark 
Painter, hurt at the end of the regu
lar season, played much of the 
game on his injured ankle, but was 
replaced in the middle of the sec
ond half when it became too diffi
cult to continue.
Scoring chances were not as com
mon in the second half as in the
first. Otterbein launched a 25-yard 
free kick which was knocked off 
course by the head of a Tartan 
defender. With three minutes to 
play, Otterbein midfielder Dennis 
Duryea hit a ball to the back of the 
net off a Manzo pass, but the goal 
was cancelled when it was deter
mined that Duryea was offside on 
the play.
Despite the chances created by all 
of the long throw-ins, Thomas held 
strong, especially with the wet con
ditions, and shut the Cardinals out 
in regulation.
The scoreless tie was finally bro
ken in the second minute of over
time, ending the game, when the 
Carnegie Mellon defense could not
clear a Cardinal throw-in. Duryea 
took the loose ball near the goal and 
sent it off the left post and to the far 
corner of the Tartan net.
It was a great season, said 
Gaudioso, but [this game] was dis
appointing as all hell. The Tartans 
final record is 16-1.
It was also the last game for the 
teams four seniors, including 
Crummy, who sought to better last 
years abbreviated trip to the NCAA 
tournament.
We felt confident after the regu
lar season, Crummy said. We 
expected to win a couple games in 
the playoff, but it was one of those 
games that didnt go the way we 
expected.

RUNNERS, from page A14
Dickinson College won the 
womens event with a score of 53. 
Elizabethtown College won the 
mens event with a score of 45.
Both of CMUs teams were com
promised due to injury and absence 
of regular runners. On the womens 
team, one of its top runners was 
unable to attend and another was 
running on a stress fracture. The 
mens team attended the race with
out two of its top runners, as both 
were out with sprained ankles.
We could have done better, but 
considering the circumstances, we 
were happy with 10th, said Aerni.
Meurers sentiments mirrored 
Aernis: Overall we were a little 
disappointed...but we were working 
at a disadvantage.
Both qualifying runners are look
ing forward to next weeks events.
Im going to try to run a nice, 
even race, and run as best as I can, 
said Meurer.
The championship meet will be

Womens soccer falls at ECACs
Wideners first goal was scored 
by midfielder Nicole Jones with 
eight minutes to play in the first 
half. Fullback Tricia Lynch added 
an insurance goal late in the second 
half off a corner kick.
Hopefully experience will allow 
us to be more consistent in the 
future and we will put away teams 
early, said junior midfielder Merry 
McConnochie. It will be tough 
though, with the loss of very strong 
contributors from this years team, 
McConnochie said, referring to the 
teams seniors.
While disappointed by the final 
game, head coach Heather Kendra 
was pleased by the success of the 
season in its entirety. We had a 
wonderful season, did wonderful 
things, she said.

Womens soccer faced Widener 
(Penn.) University (14-4-1) in the 
second round of the ECAC MidAtlantic tournament on Saturday. 
The Tartans had earned the second 
seed and a bye in the six-team tour
nament, held this weekend at 
Franklin and Marshall College. The 
2-0 loss ended their 12-4-2 season.
The Tartans dominated the field 
for most of the game, outplaying 
the Pioneers in every aspect but the 
score. In spite of an impressive 24-5 
shot differential in favor of the 
Tartans, Widener was able to sneak 
in the only goals of the game: one at 
the end of each of the two periods.
Hockey goes 1-1 in weekend contests
HOCKEY, from page A14 
bodies.
The Tartans cut the deficit to 5-2 in the second when 
first-year defensemen Devin Fell fired a slap shot from 
the left point, using a screen to slide the puck under
neath the pads of the goaltender. They ended the scor
ing with 3:18 left in the game, when Hutchinson 
deflected a shot from Fell up over the goaltender, mak
ing it 7-3.
We did a good job getting to the front of the net, 
said first-year winger Derrick Chan. We just need to do 
a better job getting on the rebounds.
Against league opponent Allegheny on Friday night, 
the Tartans played perhaps their strongest game of the
season. Without captain and senior center Rob Ready, 
the Tartans were led by junior forward Jamie Bretz, 
who had a hat trick in the 8-4 victory. Sophomore Peter 
Beutler, first-year Anthony Scolieri, Book, Fell, and 
Hutchinson all added goals for the Tartan.
It was a great game in Allegheny, said sophomore 
defenseman Brian Schmella. What was really encour
aging was the way the forwards started coming back 
and back-checking. Its an element that has been miss
ing the past few games. Also, for the first time in a 
while, we didnt give up any short-handed goals.
The win increased the Tartan record to 4-2 within 
their league. The team is preparing for two league 
games this week, at 5:30 pm on Saturday at home 
against Case Western, and Sunday at Pitt-Johnstown.

Rams' Warner doesn't stack 
up as MVP, in Hall of Fame
uchfe Achhctak
Kurt Warner has had a year to for
get. Two out of the last three years 
he has been the league MVP, and 
now a broken pinky has forced him 
to sit alone on the sidelines while he 
watches Mark Bulger save the Rams 
season. Warner put his team in a 0-5 
hole, throwing one touchdown and 
eight interceptions in the worst peri
od of his short career, and his down
ward spiral ended in injury. Now 
Warner is back, or at least he says he 
is. After a month on the sidelines 
Kurt is ready to reestablish his spot 
as the Rams starter, and one of the 
leagues premiere quarterbacks.
Well see how it goes. I predict he 
blows it, but then again, I cant stand 
the guy.
When Warner retires Im sure 
there will be all sorts of debates as to 
whether or not he deserves a spot in 
Canton. It is happening now with 
Terrell Davis, who had some of the 
best short-term totals ever, but was 
forced into early retirement due to 
injuries. Kurt Warner is not long for 
the NFL; I say three or four more 
years tops. He was older than most 
hall of famers when he came into the 
league, and I dont think he, or that 
great Rams team, will be around 
much longer.
They are like high school girl
friends: exciting, fun, fast, and short 
term. Warner will disappear from 
the league with some great totals in 
his short career, but wont have the 
long-term stats to compare to guys 
like Dan Marino, John Elway, or Joe 
Montana.
I dont think Warner deserves to 
have his bust in the hall, and I dont 
think Davis does, either. Being a hall 
of famer requires greatness, and 
greatness is measured not only in 
talent, but also in longevity.
Actually, I dont think Kurt Warner 
is that good of a quarterback. I never 
have. I dont think he deserved the 
MVP awards, the accolades, or any 
credit thrown his way. His team is 
just as well off without him. Ill 
debate about his place in pro foot
balls history later, but for now Im 
irate that people think this guy is a 
great quarterback. He clearly isnt 
that important to his team, and he 
definitely isnt the MVP of the 
league.
MVP means Most Valuable Player. 
An MVP is the man you want to 
build around. If you were starting 
from scratch youd start with him. 
Warner is not that guy, and he never 
has been. Warner has benefited from
the most quarterback-friendly Jt
offense ever. Even better than the 
great 49ers teams of the 80s.
If you put any of the great quarter
backs of all time in Warners situa
tion, I guarantee their stats would~be 
even better than what they are. -
Can you imagine Dan Marino on 
the Rams? How about Joe Montana, 
or even Brett Favre? It would be a 
dynasty; the team would win several 
championships in a row. There is no 
excuse why the Rams dont win 
every year, they have the best . r 
offense and should be able to 
outscore anyone. I contend that 
Warner brings the team down. He, 
makes more mistakes and throws ,. 
more picks than anyone. I will con
cede that he is one of the most accu
rate passers the game has ever seen, 
but that doesnt make him great, npt 
by a long shot.
In the Rams offense, anyone can 
look like an MVP quarterback. Trent 
Green proved that last year when 
Warner went down, and Mark Bulger 
is doing the same thing this year.
You want a real test? Throw Warner 
on the Eagles, or the Texans. See 
what he can do without two of the 
best receivers in the league, the best 
player in the league (Marshall 
Faulk), plus an incredible offensive 
line. Warner benefits from his situa
tion. He is not MVP quality; he does
nt have the vision to make decisions. 
All his routes are planned for him; 
he just gets the ball where he has tp. 
Whens the last time youve seen him 
create plays? He hardly ever has to 
do it because the Rams offense is 
like clockwork, and he is just anoth
er gear. He is a good quarterback, 
but he couldnt be what he is on any 
other team.
Guys like Favre, Donovan 
McNabb, Jeff Garcia, Drew Bledsoe, 
and Rich Gannon are MVP quarter-- 
backs. They make plays when none, 
exist. Warner just throws the ball ^ 
where he has to when he has to. . v
The MVP award, and all the praise 
that comes with it, should be 
reserved for players who carry their 
team to success. It should go to a guy 
whose team cant function without 
him and the Rams have proven they 
can succeed without Kurt Warner. , 
He isnt, and never has been, an 
MVP. His only credit is that he does
nt mess up the golden opportunity, 
he has to succeed. Put him in a situa
tion where he has to make that , 
opportunity, and I guarantee he ^ 
would fail.

Volleyball wins regional ECAC title
Women cruise to easy victories in tournament against Westminster and Moravian
by Daniel Kim
Staffwriter
The womens volleyball team came 
to play Saturday, each player sporting 
two French braids and identical rib
bons in their hair.
One week after a less-than-satisfying showing at the UAA champi
onships, the Tartans hosted the 
Eastern College Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) South Region championships 
this past weekend.
And they came out big: the team 
breezed through the competition and 
won the tournament, dropping only 
one game.
Lauren Schmidt, senior outside hit
ter and two-time All-UAA first team 
selection, won Most Valuable Player 
honors for the tournament.
The win capped an otherwise dis
appointing season that was full of 
close matches and missed opportuni
ties. The Tartans had extremely high 
expectations entering this season, 
coming off their best season ever last 
year, when they went 27-7 and were 
able to beat Washington University.
Although things did not work out 
exactly as they would have liked, the 
Tartans played volleyball at a high 
level throughout the season, and fin
ished 27-12.
Its not like were going to have 
any regrets or anything, said senior 
setter Amy Bergvall. I think were all 
pretty happy with how everything
ended up.
The Tartans were seeded second in 
the ECAC tournament and had a firstround bye. Their first match came 
against Westminster College, the 
sixth seed in the six-team tourna
ment.
The Tartans faltered early and 
dropped the first game 27-30, but 
crushed the Titans in the next three, 
30-21, 30-24, 30-19, leaving no 
doubt that they were the better team.
Schmidt started slow, hitting just 
.100 in the first game, but came on 
strong to finish the match with 22 
kills and a .400 hitting percentage.
Dustyn Roberts, a senior hitter, 
was particularly effective in the sec
ond game, hitting .550.
Bergvall displayed her versatility 
and wide range of abilities, hitting an 
efficient .460 in addition to recording 
57 assists.
In the finals, the Tartans dominat
ed top-seeded Moravian Greyhounds, 
winning the match 30-16, 30-15, 
30-21.
The Tartans jumped out to an 11-4 
lead in the first game and didnt let 
up, overcoming the size of 
Moravians middle hitters by using a 
variety of short and deep serves, and 
by punishing any mistakes. They put 
away any overpasses and converted 
the free balls, leaving little to be 
desired in their performance.
Schmidt ended the first game with 
an ace off of a short serve that just 
barely cleared the net and dropped
into the middle of six Greyhounds.
In the second game, the Tartans 
dominated the Greyhounds at the 
net, putting up big blocks and attack
ing aggressively. First-year and 
sophomore middle hitters Chrissy 
Bartek and Lisa Seacat played 
extremely well, hitting .390 and .430 
respectively.
The play got a little bit sloppy in 
the third game, but the Tartans ral
lied and closed the game out strong 
to take the match, and the regional 
title.
We played as a team, we played 
really well, and it showed in the 
scores, said Bartek. We beat them 
pretty easily, and had a lot of fun 
doing it. I think that helped a lot.
During the awards ceremony, all 
five seniors, Bergvall, Christina 
Casella, Audra Pompeani, Roberts, 
and Schmidt, went up to accept the 
first-place plaque. The five seniors 
and Coach Julie Webb embraced in a 
tight circle of friendship after the 
game, and it was easy to see that the 
players not only shared the volleyball 
court for the past four years, but they 
shared their entire college experi
ences, too.
Its been great, said Bergvall. 
Theyre like my core group of 
friends. Volleyball has been a great 
way to have a group of girls to con
nect with, and we all get along really 
well. Its pretty crazy to think that it 
was our last game. I dont think its 
really hit me yet.

The mens soccer team was 
knocked out of the NCAA Division III 
tournament on Saturday, when it suf
fered its first defeat of the season in 
the Great Lakes regional semifinals 
against Otterbein (Ohio) College 
(20-2-1).
Otterbein was ranked fourth 
nationally at the beginning of the 
week, while CMU was ranked ninth. 
The 1-0 overtime loss marked the 
second consecutive year the Tartans 
exited the tournament after an extra 
period in the second round.
The Tartans scouted the Cardinals 
on Wednesday, but they were not pre
pared to play Otterbein in Saturdays 
rain. One thing they discovered was 
an Otterbein defender with the abili
ty to launch throw-ins 50 yards; in 
Saturdays conditions, the balls went 
even farther, hydroplaning along the 
wet field.
Throughout the game, Otterbein 
placed throw-ins deep into the Tartan
half of the field. There were 30 balls 
he put into our box, said head coach 
Nick Gaudioso.
They didn't have much of an 
offensive attack except [their 
throws], said senior forward Matt 
Crummy.
The team was disadvantaged fur
ther by the Otterbein defense, which 
targeted senior midfielder Adam 
Hibshman, shadowing him much of 
the game. This did not eliminate his 
effect on the game, as he nearly 
scored directly off a 40-yard free kick, 
which was knocked over the crossbar 
by Otterbein keeper Jeffery Rust.
Otterbein had the next major 
chance when a Mike Lochner throwin landed in the box. Tartan goal
keeper Dave Thomas punched the 
ball away but could not clear it. The 
second shot was deflected wide. 
Otterbeins last attempt on the offen
sive came as forward Angelo Manzo 
headed the ball off'the ensuing cor
ner kick. Thomas made a spectacular 
save to preserve the shut out.

Several members of the Carnegie Mellon foot
ball team gathered on the Gesling Stadium turf 
Saturday for pictures following their match-up 
with the University of Rochester. Mostly seniors, 
the group stood together as the cameras snapped 
and bulbs flashed. They looked about as comfort
able as a man with a jacket full of brambles, not a 
smile among them. But what, then, was there to 
smile about anyway?
Saturdays 39-35 loss to Rochester handed 
CMU its fifth defeat of the year, a 1-3 University 
Athletic Association record, and a .500 season. 
Perhaps worst of all, it marks the first time since 
1975 that the Tartans have not had a winning 
record.
And for head coach Richard Lackner, a four
time UAA Coach of the Year recipient, its his first 
non-winning season with this program. The 
University of Rochester (2-8, 1-3), meanwhile, 
picked up only their second win of the year on a 
day which could easily be considered the seasons 
highlight for the Jackets. For Carnegie Mellon and 
its discouraging up-and-down year, this most 
surely is the lowlight.
Leading 28-14 entering the fourth quarter, the
Tartans proceeded to give up 25 points to 
Rochester, 18 of which were scored unanswered 
during the quarters first twelve minutes. Overall, 
the Tartans allowed 494 yards in total offense to 
the Yellowjackets. Rochester quarterback Pat 
Manuels right arm alone accounted for 356 yards 
of that total. Saturdays contest marked the most 
total offensive yards and passing yards allowed by 
CMU this year. And with 27 first downs, the 
Yellowjackets bettered the previous high-water 
mark in the UAA set earlier this season by Case 
Western Reserve. Clearly, the implosion of the 
Carnegie Mellon football team could not have 
come at a more inopportune time.
We accomplished none of our goals, said 
Lackner about the teams season-long troubles. 
We had a .500 hundred season, we wanted a win
ning season. We wanted to win the UAA, we came 
in last in the UAA.... We wanted a chance at post
season play, thats just not going to happen with a 
5-5 football team.
On the bright side  if there is one to be found 
here  the Tartans continued an impressive rush
ing attack that has been a CMU staple all year, win 
or lose. The 71 rushing plays by the Tartans gave 
the team a 35:32 time of possession and 345 total 
yards. Fullback Adam Urbanczyk led the way with 
123 yards, finishing as the top Tartan rusher on 
the year (549 yards). The senior provided three of
the five CMU touchdowns Saturday afternoon. 
The sophomore surprise and UAA Player-of-theWeek Brad Stanley contributed 83 yards on the 
ground as well as one TD. Ricardo Clarke, 
Urbanczyks counterpart for much of the year, 
added 72 yards and the Tartans longest rush of 
the day, a 32-yarder in the fourth quarter that set 
up an Urbanczyk seven yard TD. It put CMU 
ahead 35-32 with 2:43 left to play.
The Yellowjackets responded by exploiting the 
Tartan secondary, a hallmark of their last five con
tests, three of which were losses. On Saturday, 
Rochesters four wide receiver sets beat the 
Tartans zone and man-to-man coverage schemes 
during the entire second half. Manuel, a first year 
quarterback, set single season records in comple
tions (148), attempts (288), and total offense 
(2,144 yards). Manuel put together four drives in 
the fourth quarter for 275 yards and 25 points.
After Tartan kicker Benjamin Koellmann booted 
the ball into the end zone at the 2:38 mark with 
CMU ahead by three, the Yellowjackets marched 
80 yards on 12 plays for the winning score. On 
2nd and 10 at the 20, Manuel completed two con
secutive passes to receiver Brian Ferris, who led 
Rochester with 11 catches. Manuel then hooked 
up with running back John Breedy for 17 yards to

Hockey team splits weekend games

Contributing Editor
After coming up with a huge 
league victory against Allegheny 
Friday night, a tired Tartan ice hock
ey lost a 7-3 exhibition game against 
a tough Division II West Virginia 
University team.
While the Tartans played a tough, 
physical game, they lacked energy, 
having returned from the Allegheny 
victory at 4:30 am.
The Tartans were done in by 
WVUs quick start, as just 32 seconds
into the game, the Mountaineers 
opened up a lead. After the 
Mountaineers scored their second 
goal, the Tartans had a chance to get 
on the scoreboard with 8:10 remain
ing as senior DJ Book got loose on a 
breakaway. He hit the crossbar, and 
the puck bounced out to a West 
Virginia forward, setting up the 
teams third goal. Book made 
amends for hitting the crossbar just 
59 seconds later, when he put a 
backhand shot through the 
Mountaineer goalies 5-hole. Still, 
after the first period, it was 5-1 
Mountaineers.
It just took our team too long to 
get our feet on the ground, said 
sophomore Kevin Hutchinson.
Graduate student and backup 
goalie Doug Williard got the start in 
goal, and after the first period he 
came on strong. He was tested in the 
second period, stopping every shot 
he faced, including a breakaway.
WVU didnt score on him again 
until 3:53 into the third period, 
when after making a save, there was 
a mad scramble in front and the 
puck was pushed in next to a pile of

Assistant Sports Editor
Senior Katie Aerni and junior Matt 
Meurer will be in Minnesota this 
week to compete in the NCAA 
Division III championships. They 
qualified this past Saturday in the 
NCAA Mideast Regional meet held at 
Salisbury University, in Maryland. 
Out of 34 teams, the men took sixth 
place with a score of 183, and the 
women took 10th with a score of 305.
Aerni placed eighth out of 247 run
ners in the womens 6k run, with a 
time of 21.39.19  beating her per
sonal best by 43 seconds.
Katies race was amazing, said
Meurer. She started at a slow, even 
pace, and worked her way to the 
front.
Other top finishers for the 
Carnegie Mellon women included 
sophomore Nicole Gartner at 45th 
place, senior Susan Pevovar at 82nd, 
Jocelyn Sikora at 89th, and first-year 
Ashley Krankowski at 99th.
Meurer placed 16th out of 241 run
ners in the mens 8k run, with a time 
of 25:19.14, beating his personal best 
by 88 seconds. Also placing well were 
first-year Dana Irrer at 25th, firstyear Nick End at 36th, senior Mike 
Rossi at 44th, and junior Patrick 
Fisher at 62nd.

For the first time, second-semester first-years became eligible to pledge a soror
ity. Because of this change in the rushing system, interested women were able to 
spend a longer time of their college career in a sorority. It also gave those inter
ested more time to become familiar with the sororities. The rushing period was 
shortened to one month, and included luncheon dates as well as parties. A sec
ond, shorter rushing period would be held in September.

A boiler exploded in the basement of Morewood B tower. A methane leak under 
a new boiler caused one of the three boilers to burst. The incident caused $10,000 
in damage. All Morewood residents were evacuated from the building for two 
hours. According to Ken Service, Public Relations Director, the boiler was 
irreparable and would have to be replaced. Several people stated that many fire 
alarms had not been operating that morning, causing some concern. According to 
Morewood resident Carolyn Welty, the bang had shaken the whole building. As 
a result of the explosion, campus tours were cut short that day and visits to dor
mitories were left out.

and overweight women, and unfairly cut them from the program. The Office of 
Student Affairs asked anyone who felt that there was sexism in the Drama 
Department to voice his or her concerns. Don Martinelli, associate head of the 
Drama Department stated that if Student Affairs or HRC would launch any type 
of investigation, the department would fully cooperate. Scott Safier, a member of 
CMUs association of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Employees said that he had 
every reason to believe [the accusations were] valid due to a general homophobic attitude in drama. Drama responded to Scanlan with a letter in Theater 
Week.

Cohon spoke of focusing on the bond between CMU and Pittsburgh. According to 
Cohon, both Pittsburgh and CMU would need to take on a more global perspec

A failure of the HUBs Online Registration system (OLR) slowed down the year

were especially severe on Wednesday and Thursday, making registration most 
difficult for sophomores and first-years. Some students were unable to access the 
system during their designated time slots while others had free access to the sys
tem regardless of their scheduled registration time. Darleen Labarbera, the direc
tor of Enrollment Systems, said that these problems were unexpected since 
OLRs performance application [was] exactly the same as in the past.

Fifth-Year Scholars
Current seniors wholl be attending CMU for an extra year discuss their fifth-year projects
Carnegie Mellon first-years are presented 
each year with lists of requirements that 
some feel restrain the breadth of their educa
tion. They sometimes find it difficult to take 
classes outside of their college in order to 
gain knowledge in an unrelated field. The 
Fifth-year Scholars Program offers these stu
dents a solution.
The program, started in 1991, was pro
posed by a student who was never able to be 
in the program, according to Michele Grab, 
fifth-year scholar program advisor.
A committee selects between two and 
seven students to study for a fifth year, and 
the University waives tuition for these schol
ars additional year and provides a $7,000 
stipend for the student to use at their discre
tion. Currently, six fifth-year scholars study 
at the University.
Potential scholars must be able to graduate 
by the end of their senior year to qualify. The 
program is not, however, intended for stu
dents to use to earn a masters degree or com
plete medical school requirements.
Perhaps the best-known fifth-year scholar 
is art student William Kofmehl, aka Lobster 
Boy, who is using the year to study engineer
ing.
The program revolves around a project 
that each student proposes to benefit either 
the Pittsburgh or Carnegie Mellon communi
ties. For his project, Kofmehl will install on 
campus grounds artwork that pays homage 
to Pittsburgh's industrial past. In the past 
decade, projects have included new curricu
lum development and the changing of the 
room draw process.
Some questions students ask themselves 
in developing a proposal are: What would 
have made my experience here better? What 
could make future students experience bet
ter? said Grab.
Interested students are required to apply in 
their junior year because they use the senior 
year to finalize plans and get the Universitys 
approval for the project.
One scholar, Krista Pfaendler, will teach a 
course entitled Subjects Your High School 
Class Didnt Cover next semester.
While the projects of fifth-year students 
are now in their final stages, current seniors 
are still in the preliminary phases of their 
own projects.
Inspired by the quote on the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall rotunda and her
studies in Computer Science, Rebecca 
Deutsch plans to install a permanent artistic 
piece on campus that will help celebrate the 
role of women at Carnegie Mellon.
In preparation of her piece, Deutsch has 
researched how the role of women at 
Carnegie Mellon has changed from the 
beginning of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School for Women to today. 
Deutschs research will provide the basis for 
how she constructs the piece.
I would like to bring context and under
standing to the quote and what it meant for 
the women during the early 20th century, 
she said.
Robin Hewlett plans to create a mural with 
several sections that would be painted in dif
ferent Pittsburgh neighborhoods including 
one at the University. Her main goal is to link 
the neighborhoods together and strengthen 
connections within individual communities.
Im planning on selecting artists over the 
summer. In the fall, there will be a lot of dis
cussion over the design and specific location 
of the murals. By spring semester, I think 
well hopefully be ready to paint them, said 
Hewlett.
Fifth year scholar Lisa Podgurski, a senior 
biology and psychology major, is focusing her 
project on the relatively new interdiscipli
nary college, Scholars of Humanities and 
Sciences (SHS). She plans to add a colloqui
um for SHS sophomores, a mentor program 
for SHS students, and a lecture series.
The lecture series features speakers from 
both H&SS and MCS that inform SHS stu
dents of opportunities they may be unaware 
of because they lack full affiliation with 
either college. Podgurskis goal is to feature 
two to four speakers every year.
[The colloquiums] will be designed to 
help SHS students find out about interests 
they may not find out about otherwise. It will 
be informational, but students will also get to 
share and discuss their different interests, 
Podgurski said.
Juniors who would like to apply to the pro
gram can visit www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/fifth/nonacad.html and con
tact Michele Grab (mgrab@andrew.cmu.edu)

for application is Monday, February 10.

As a Starbucks employee, I am given the 
mixed blessing of a pound of coffee every 
week. Even for me  a javaphile of the high
est order  thats a lot of beans to keep up 
with, so rather than let the glossy bags pile 
up in my freezer, Im always on the lookout 
for creative ways to use them up. The results 
so far have ranged from sweet to savory, from 
morning to night, from traditional to down
right surprising; there are coffee recipes 
enough to please anyones palate. Here are a 
few of the highlights (and lowlights) of my 
quest:
HONEY CAKE: This decadent pastry is tra
ditionally baked in Jewish homes on New 
Years Eve, but is best enjoyed on New Years 
Day, when its flavors reach peak sweetness. 
The honey is said to bring joy and good luck 
for the coming year, but a dessert like this 
works well in any season.
1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour 
1/2 c. rye flour
3/4 tsp. baking powder 
1/2 tsp. cinnamon 
1/2 tsp. ground cloves 
1/2 tsp. salt
2 eggs
3/4 c. packed dark brown sugar
3/4 c. honey
1/2 c. vegetable oil
3/4 c. cold coffee
1. Preheat an oven to 350F. Meanwhile, 
grease a 9x5 loaf pan, line the pan with 
parchment paper, and grease the paper.
2. In a bowl, combine both flours, baking 
powder, spices, and salt. In a second bowl, 
beat together the eggs and sugar. Once 
theyre light and fluffy, add the honey and
oil, then the coffee. Being careful not to beat 
the air out of the batter, fold in the dry ingre
dients using a rubber spatula.
3. Scrape the batter into the pan, and let it 
bake for 75 minutes. Set the pan aside to cool 
completely, then run a knife around the sides 
to loosen the edges. Remove the cake and 
wrap it with plastic wrap. Before you eat it, 
let the cake sit at room temperature 
overnight, to let the flavors fully develop. 
Serves eight.
CAMPING COOKIES: These are the laziest 
cookies ever. You dont even have to bake 
them.
1/2 c. softened butter 
2/3 c. white sugar

What to do with too much coffee, other than drink it straight
3 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder 
1 Tbsp. strong coffee 
1/2 tsp. vanilla 
1 3/4 c. rolled oats 
1/3 c. powdered sugar
1. Beat together the butter, white 
sugar, cocoa, coffee and vanilla, then 
add the oats.
2. Roll the dough into 36 one-inch 
balls, and dust them with powdered 
sugar.
3. Eat them, lazy pig.
CAF EUROPA: The egg whites in 
this simple recipe produce a sweet 
meringue swirl with a subtle marsh
mallow flavor.
2 egg whites
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract fT
2 c. strong coffee 
4 Tbsp. half-and-half
1. Beat the egg whites and vanilla 
until they form stiff peaks. Divide the 
mixture into fourths, and add one dol
lop to each of four warmed coffee 
mugs.
2. Pour the brewed coffee into the 
mugs, and add the half-and-half. The 
whites will rise like foam to the top. 
Serves four.
MOCHA CHICKEN: I confess that I 
havent tried this dish out yet, but 
according to its mad inventor, David Yee of 
allrecipes.com, its a potent aphrodisiac. And 
as strange as Mocha Chicken sounds, its still 
less intimidating than his recipe for Cornish 
Hens with Coffee Liqueur Sauce.
2/3 c. soy sauce
1/2 c. brown sugar
1/4 c. cooking sherry
1/4 c. strong brewed coffee
1/4 c. olive oil
6 chicken legs
Pepper to taste
1. Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, 
sherry, coffee, and two tablespoons of the 
olive oil in a plastic container. Add the chick
en legs, cover the container, and let it mari
nate in the refrigerator for three hours.
2. Remove the chicken from the marinade 
and set it aside. Meanwhile, transfer the 
marinade to a medium saucepan and bring it 
to a boil.
3. Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet 
over medium-high heat. Season the chicken 
with pepper and add it to the oil. Brown the 
chicken on all sides, then pour the hot mari
nade into the skillet. Reduce the heat, and 
simmer the chicken for 30 minutes or until it 
is no longer pink in the center. Let it sit for 10 
minutes before you eat. Serves four.
MAPLE COFFEE: A rich and comforting 
treat, this drink was featured in Southern 
Living magazines 1997 Recipe Hall of Fame.
2 c. half-and-half 
1 c. maple syrup
3 c. strong coffee
1. Thoroughly heat the half-and-half and 
syrup over medium heat, without reaching a 
boil.
2. Stir in the coffee. Serves six.

lowed by discussion with Strada and Teresa 
Sarti. The lectures are open to the public, and 
students are encouraged to attend.
First intervening in the Rwanda conflict of 
1994, the small, self-financed medical organiza
tion re-opened the public hospital and materni
ty ward of the countrys capital, Kigali. The 
growing international organization established 
its first hospital in Iraqi Kurdistan in 
Sulaimanya. To this day, Emergency maintains 
working hospitals in Kurdistan, Cambodia, 
Afghanistan, and Sierra Leone, in addition to 25 
first-aid posts.
In their promotion of cultural peace, 
Emergency also makes major efforts to aid those 
affected by and increase public awareness of
anti-personnel land mines. Stradas article The 
Horror of Landmines was featured in Scientific 
American (May 1996). Strada and his organiza
tion have appeared in Time magazine, the film 
Jung in the Land of the Mujaheddin (shown at 
the 2002 Human Rights Watch Film Review 
Festival), on PBSs Point of View (www.pov.org), 
and the NBC Nightly News.
Emergency holds a non-political, non-bureaucratic format; anyone can become involved. 
There are many realms of the organization in 
which someone like a student could participate. 
Emergency currently has about 3,000 volun
teers.
Before the formation of Emergency, Strada 
was a member of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC), through which he 
worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Peru, Bosnia, 
and other countries. After five years with ICRC, 
Strada decided to apply his war surgery experi
ence to a smaller and more efficient organiza
tion  Emergency was established. Not only 
does the group help those wounded by war, but 
it also aids civilians who are indirectly affected 
by treating cases of malnutrition and disease. As 
of March 2002, Emergency had aided over 
300,000 patients. Emergencys efforts have 
made them virtual heroes throughout Europe, 
but remain lesser known in the US.

Bottlecaps and driftwood pieces
Folk Art Pittsburgh opens at the Society for Contemporary Craft with Mr. Imagination
Mr. Imagination is a self-taught artist, an outsider artist, 
as he is commonly called.
I dont care for that term, really, said Mr. Imagination. 
Isnt this show on the inside? And indeed, the show last 
Friday at the Society for Contemporary Craft (SCC) not only 
was on the inside, it was a very large exhibition, showing over 
50 pieces of his work.
Gregory Warmack uses the moniker Mr. Imagination, 
and, despite not having any formal training in the arts, has 
become a successful found-art artist. Growing up on the 
south side of Chicago, he started making art using card
board boxes and paint. Once he ran out of paint brushes, he 
would find twigs and paint with those. Soon he start
ed taking whatever he could find and creating art 
pieces and jewelry that he would sell on the streets 
of Chicago and in restaurants and bars.
The Mr. Imagination Exhibition is part of a citywide Folk Art Celebration. The SCC, located in the 
Strip District, is one of 15 galleries and museums par
ticipating in Folk Art Pittsburgh during this win
ter. The opening at the SCC last Friday was the 
first for the folk arts celebration, which will con- 3^3 
tinue until the end of January.
I think the folk art celebration ties in nicely 
with us, it comes from the same conscience. We 
almost always have some folk art showing in our gallery, 
if not in our store, said Kathleen Radock from the SCC. 
Through the gallery, a retail store, and a satellite gallery in 
downtown Pittsburgh, the SCC exhibits and sells local and 
national artists works in furniture, wood, metals, jewelry.
Besides showcasing and selling work, the society works 
with the community through studio classes and outreach pro
grams. In fact, part of the Mr. Imagination exhibition is com
plimentary educational programs and weekend activities 
meant to encourage public dialogue and exchange of ideas.
Mr. Imagination himself has always been involved with 
working with children through sharing his work. Much of this 
comes from a unique experience he had when in Chicago. He 
was shot by someone who wanted his money and was in a 
coma for one and a half months. I felt an out-of-body experi
ence seeing myself lying down. There was the brightest light I 
have ever seen. I cannot explain it, so I explain it through my
work, said Warmack.
Unlike many other artists whose artwork you cannot touch, 
Mr. Imagination encourages people to touch some of his 
pieces. I think it is very important to have something you can 
touch. In fact, if you go to the exhibition, you may sit on a bot
tle cap throne and put on a bottle cap hat.
Mr. Imagination works entirely with things 
he has found except, paint, which he buys. He 
mostly uses bottle caps, which were once 
given to him in a box when he began his 
artistry. Now he receives boxes of them from 
people who support his work.
He designs wood figurines, carves 
sandstone sculptures with a nail, and 
makes many things from bottle caps, 
like mirrors, people of all 
sizes, and even a bowtie 
and cummerbund which he 
sported for the opening. 
When I find something, I 
dont know what I am 
going to do with it, but once 
I start making things I 
remember; oh, I have a wheel, 
and such, he said.
Folk Art Pittsburghs main exhibition is 
being held at the Senator John Heinz 
Pittsburgh Regional History Center, which 
through its affiliation with the Smithsonian 
Institution is showcasing the nation-touring 
Contemporary Folk Art: Treasures from the 
Smithsonian Museum of American Art. The 
show opens on November 29 and runs 
through January 30. The exhibit features 72 
works of art by American folk artists from 
the last 40 years as well as a complementary 
show of 44 works by Western Pennsylvanian 
folk artists.
Folk Art Pittsburgh also includes a sympo
sium on December 6 and a folk art show and 
sale from December 7-8.

/imovieSpirited Away
A review of the latest anime film by Hayao Miyazaki
Spirited Away, the tenth film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, draws the view
er into its fantastic and often bizarre enchanted bathhouse setting where a 
new unimaginable spectacle is around every corner.
The film begins with Chihiro, a young girl, and her parents relocating to a 
new town. Chihiros father makes a wrong turn, and, in an attempt to take a 
shortcut, they stumble upon an eerie tunnel that leads to what appears to be 
the remains of an amusement park. As they explore the grounds, Chihiros 
father finds food, and, in their gluttony, Chihiros parents eat the enchanted 
food intended for the spirits of the earth and are transformed into pigs.
A scared Chihiro wanders off to explore further and sees the bathhouse, 
and here she is confronted by a mysterious boy named Haku. He turns her 
away, helps her find a job with Yubaba, the greedy sorceress who orches
trates the activities of the enchanted land, so that she can remain at the 
bathhouse. Chihiro signs Yubabas contract to work, and once her name 
belongs to Yubaba, she is under her spell. Her former life becomes a distant 
memory until Haku reminds her of her true self. In order to save her parents, 
she must rescue them from the herd of pigs under Yubabas spell while also 
remembering who she is and who her parents are.
In the course of the film, Chihiros character develops and her altruistic 
actions bring her new friends and allies. Visiting alumnus Anthony Ko said, 
While the movie features very bizarre characters and situations, you dont 
end up feeling that any of it is out of place. Chihiros interaction with the 
often bizarre characters makes an indelible impression on young and old 
alike. While Chihiro may not be physically strong, her inner strength and her 
drive to save her parents from the grasp of an evil witch make her easy to 
relate to and admire.
Miyazakis ability to draw the audience into an amazing world of imagi
nation and powerful storytelling is always present throughout this film. 
While watching this film, one regains a sense of curiosity for the world, and 
a new willingness to take on challenges. Spirited Away is a feel-good fantasy 
movie to immerse oneself in, perfect for getting away from the monotonous 
daily routines.
The film was beautifully animated with exquisite expression, colors, and 
motion. The spectacular imagery and characters fascinate the viewer and 
take us to the furthest reaches of our imagination. Although the film was 
made for a Japanese audience, the story transcends any cultural or social 
boundaries. The dubbing was very skillfully done, and did not detract from 
the effect of the movie at all. Miyazakis execution of these details all help to 
illustrate the meaning of the story; that a pure heart with strength and char
acter can beat the odds. Junior BHA major Sam Hart said, It creates a world 
that youre a little bit sad to leave in the end.
The Idiots 
Wednesday, November 20 
7:30 pm, 10 pm, & 12:30 am
With a tagline of Youre a whole lot dumber than you think, you can expect great 
things from this movie. Too bad its not original. Its a random Wednesday night and there 
is nothing better to do so lets make a movie about our inner idiot. I dont know for sure, 
but it sounds a lot like what my friends and I do and EXACTLY like Jackass. Going out and 
creating havoc in a supposedly normal world seems to have MTV written all over it. And 
now poor director Lars von Trier has the guilt of ripping off MTV on his shoulders.
Crash 
Thursday, November 21 
8 pm, 10 pm, & 12 am
I think that all I have to say about this movie is that there are cars, car crashes, and sex 
in it. Lots and lots of sex. I mean really from this point on is anyone still reading this or is 
everyone camping out in the UC for tickets? So the sexual acts seem a little twisted but 
hey.. .like Visitor Q wasnt? Watch out when you sit down. That might not be semen on your 
seat  it could be engine coolant. The only thing Crash is missing is Ron Jeremy and you 
in the audience.
My Big Fat Greek Wedding 
Friday, November 22 
8 pm, 10 pm, & 12 am
Now Ive heard a great deal of good things about this movie. Full of warm-hearted fam
ily humor and N*SYNC, what could be wrong with that? Not too much besides the 
N*SYNC part, but thats beside the point. Toula Portokaloss father is upset that she is dat
ing a non-Greek, but he eventually accepts that. Ian, the boyfriend, has to learn to accept 
Toulas huge family, and Toula has to learn to accept herself. [Insert good moral message 
here.] The point is that My Big Fat Greek Wedding is actually heart-warming and we all 
need a little of that so close to Thanksgiving break.

cast. There is even someone named Mr. Gruber. I went to high school with several Grubers. 
There are 15 of them in the same family, averaging one per grade. I wonder if this is one of 
their long-lost relatives. Oh, and it looks like there is a funeral and a mental hospital and 
Danny Shea AND it all takes place in the 80s!

A Wild Christmas Binge
Christopher Durangs new play premiers at Pittsburghs City Theatre
The more we eat, the bigger our stomachs get. And the on last years starkly innocent BlaclThe more we eat, the bigger our stomachs get. And the 
bigger our stomachs get, the more we have to eat to feel full 
And the more we gorge ourselves on Christmas morning 
fruitcake and Dolby Digital, 24-bit, naked Jean-Claude Van 
Damme Bikini Streetfighters XXX: Total Annihilation, the 
more it takes to get us to sit still long enough to feel 
engaged, let alone satisfied.
Christopher Durangs new play, Mrs. Bob 
Cratchits Wild Christmas Binge, which premiered 
Wednesday night at City Theatre, speaks to that 
very conflict in our shrunken minds. It has 
singing, it has dancing, and it knows just 
what to do with a jaded palate. Just like 
on TV, theres time travel, electroshock 
therapy, and people getting Touched by an 
Angel. The play is also a ripping political 
allegory, by the way. But well get to that 
in a minute.
First, lets get the information out of 
the way. Durang went to Harvard, holds 
a Masters degree in drama from Yale, 
and co-chairs Juilliards playwriting 
program with Marsha Norman. He is 
known for a cadre of notably-wicked 
stage satires, among them Beyond 
Therapy (1981) and Baby With the 
Bathwater (1983). He gleefully 
taunts and gores our societys most, 
sacred institutions like a deranged 
toreador, and in Mrs. Bob, he takes 
on Christmas with a saccharine spite 
fairly described as Grinch-worthy.
Annalisa Schaefer/Copy Staff
But how did we get so lucky? Tracy Brigden, City 
Theaters artistic director (and the director of Mrs. Bob), is 
committed to new plays. With the help of City Theatres 
New Play Circle committee, the theater commissioned a 
brand new work from Durang at the end of last summer, 
and began preparing to produce it.
The play has been in development for a little under a 
year, said Brigden of the first leg of the process, which cul
minated in a New York City reading a month before 
rehearsals began. After the reading, a new draft was forged, 
and the workshopping began in earnest.
[Durang] was with us for the first week of rehearsal and 
the preview period, she said, during which time changes 
were made, as with any other new play.
And how was working with The Man Himself?
It really wasnt any different at all, said Brigden, from 
her experience working with, say, playwright Adam Rapp
on last years starkly innocent Blackbird. The real advantage 
in working with Durang was the sense of seasoned crafts
manship his expertise brought to bear on the work.
Sets, lights, costumes and sound have never been wield
ed with such a razor-fine edge. Elizabeth Hope Clancys 
media-influenced costumes easily encompass  to 
name a few  The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, 
Oliver!, the 1970s and prime-time television. Rick 
Martins lights separate a small space into dis
tinct, sometimes imaginary, worlds  no 
mean feat. The set, by Jeff Cowie, is simple 
but descriptive; we feel swallowed up into 
Dickensian London, whether we like it or 
not. Happy-go-lucky original music 
(Michael Friedman) and chummy cho
reography (Scott Wise) complete the 
uber-joyful landscape  this is more 
than high camp; this is social satire at 
its most deceptively deadly.
Familiar Dickens underdog characters 
like Tiny Tim archetypal poverty at its 
most whiny  are only half the equa
tion. The corpulent Fezziwigs and avaricious-but-delicious Scrooge represent us and 
our consumer fixation  as does Leona 
Helmsley (I wont spoil her priceless 
cameo by revealing any more 
than that). While we swallow 
the show like a hefty plate of 
pigs-in-a-blanket, happy to 
watch the yuletide cheer 
onstage get smashed to 
smithereens, were unconsciously affected by the 
shows hidden message; that there is no simple answer to 
this mess. Bottom line: tastes great. Mentally meaty, but 
with fewer calories than fruitcake.

French farce
The School of Drama's latest studio show
In Feu La Mere de Madame, the School of Dramas third 
studio show, loud, frantic, frenetic, clumsy, dim-witted and 
crazy characters dominated the story, and sanity-apparently-was a hard thing to come by. The intimate farce and its 
cast of four junior drama majors felt just right in the small 
Helen Wayne Rauh studio. The story began when Lucien 
(Casey Spindler), returned home at an ungodly hour to his 
wife Annette (Shashanah Newman) and maid Yvonne (Erin 
Bridges). Argument ensued, naturally, but it was not until 
the servant of Madame Annettes mother (Van Hansis) 
arrived with important news that the energy was turned up 
a notch (or four).
For a classic play, Feu la Mere's storyline is a little thin, but 
after all, it is farce  the pace and physical actions are more 
important this time. Anywhere the actors went, they were 
desperate to get there  they ran upstage, downstage, on 
the bed, under the bed and everywhere else they possibly 
could to escape their impending doom. Every movement 
was exaggerated and every moment had to be perfect. 
Director Adam Houghton made use of every scene piece and 
prop to full advantage, and the meticulous physical comedy 
and perfect timing could only have been the result of count
less hours of practice, practice, practice. Jessica Nobles cos
tumes were frilly and wild, but still realistic enough to add 
to the comedy without overwhelming it. Marie Wagners set 
was sweet and simple as a tune, set to the colors of flowery 
pink. A bed, chair, dresser and two doors were the rest, and 
they were all that was needed to wreak havoc on stage.
Although director Houghtons skill was evident in Mere, 
the show wouldnt be a success without the right actors. Van 
Hansis stood out especially as dim-witted Joseph. His 
actions were big, and he exuded such high levels of energy 
that simply watching him immediately catapulted one to 
the height of panic. Shashanah Newman was convincing as 
the madame; her mannerisms were not those of a college 
student, but a proper French lady  and a highly perturbed 
one, at that. Feu La Mere offered great comedy, a good cast 
and great direction. If youre yearning for more French 
farce, the School of Dramas next main stage production is 
Pierre Marivauxs Game of Love and Chance.

Next stop: Forbes at Murray
Regular riders, regular drivers: PAT bus life
corner of Beacon and 
Wightman Streets, 
supervising the kids 
and adults who cross 
the street and catch the 
67H going into town. 
She talks to almost 
everyone. Melda is also 
a source of information 
 when she spots a 
regular morning rider 
walking down the hill 
or rounding the corner 
as the bus approaches, 
she motions to hurry 
up.
They ask for advice every now and then, he says, Its 
kind of like being a bartender. But its kind of hard [to talk] 
when youre driving.
But do passengers talk to each other on the bus? Sure, 
Berkley says  and Mindy Fleishman of Squirrel Hill agrees. 
She has had personal experience with the regular effect, 
and its power to start the day on a positive note. Fleishman is 
General Manager of Marketing and International Trade, and 
like the majority of the 67Hs regulars, works Downtown.
I used to have some friends who used to work at 
Kaufmanns, says Fleishman, We used to ride together 
every day. But they lost their jobs [when the corporate par
ent consolidated operations], so now I dont really know anyI try to keep every
body getting their 
buses, I guess, says 
Turner.
But she continued to ride the bus, and one night her sad 
affect caught the attention of one of the previous bus drivers 
on the route.
I had just lost my dog in February, and was still extreme
ly upset about it, and [the driver] noticed the change in me, 
and he asked me what had happened, recalls Fleishman, 
And the next day he handed me a sympathy card.
Some 67Hers connections to other regulars extend 
beyond the confines of the bus route. Just ask Mary Ann 
Kuruna, a regular who boards the bus in Oakland. Most 
mornings, she sees two other people who live in Oakland on 
the bus. Art Institute student Steve Hoover says he can be 
shy, but sometimes invites fellow 67Hers to church on days 
when hes cranked full of Jesus. Chuck Stern and Elliot 
Weinberg, of Squirrel Hill, share a chat each morning on the 
way to their jobs  theyre both accountants.
And there are 67Hers who take the whole thing pretty seri
ously. Cara Gilotti, a tech support specialist from Squirrel 
Hill, thinks the people on the periphery of our daily routine 
should be more than acquaintances  and to experiment 
with this theory, she thinks it might be fun to throw a 67H 
cocktail party.
Ive met a lot of friends, really good friends, on this bus, 
she says, People are predisposed to like things and people 
that are familiar. We start to see them as ... as part of our 
lives.

]VIy day starts out in the dark, tossing and turning, press
ing the snooze again and again. Finally, after makeup, show

giving of the mornings ultimatums is what finally makes me 
sit up and take notice: if I dont step on it, Im going to miss 
.he bus.
In moments Im barreling down the concrete hill toward 
the rising sun, passing on my way the carefree dog-walkers of 
Beacon Street, utterly un-busy with their leisurely morning 
routine. At the corner, crossing guard Melda Turner is wait
ing for me.
Still nice out, she greets me.
Turner lives in East Liberty, but this morning and every 
workday morning for the past 10 years, shes stood at the
Aw, ya missed it! 
she says, laughing, 
when someone doesnt 
make it. Sometimes, 
Turner worries about 
her regulars.
Sometimes, she even 
worries for her own 
safety.
When the bears 
were running loose, I 
was wondering where I 
was going to go [to 
hide] if one of them 
came up the street  I 
think that was in 1998, she says, referring to the incident in 
which two bears escaped from the Pittsburgh Zoo and were 
finally captured in a wooded area in Greenfield, less than a 
mile from Turners corner. Most days, Turner sees a lot of 
dogs  but thats about it.
When the bus eases itself over the hump of Wightman, the 
sky is already light. The driver, Anthony Berkley of Churchill, 
says he often recognizes the same riders each day, at rough
ly the same time. Berkley drives the 67H four days a week 
and notices the changes in peoples moods.
People are more upbeat in the morning than they are in 
the evening, he says. Most of his regular morning passen
gers are commuters. Sometimes later at night passengers are 
drunk, he says, which can make them talk to him about all 
sorts of things.

Riding to the end of the line 
and visiting the garage
What happens when you ride a bus to the end of the 
line? Where is it? What is it? What does it look like? What 
do they do to those foolish enough to attempt to find the 
answers to these questions?
If your curiosity gets the better of you, and you decide 
to go in search of the answers to these important ques
tions, you will discover this: when you get to the end of 
the line ... they tell you to get off the bus. You lurch to a 
stop, the driver hollers everybody off, and everyone qui
etly files out. If you attempt this on the 61C, youll end up 
in a run-down mill town, either on the scary-looking street 
corner of Eighth Avenue and Ann Street in the middle of 
downtown Homestead (the part that isnt the Waterfront) 
or along Lysle Boulevard, the barren main thoroughfare of 
downtown McKeesport.
Once you reach the end of the line, you have two choic
es. You can stand and wait for an indefinite number of 
minutes (hours) for the next (purely theoretical) bus to 
pass by. Or, you can walk back up to the bus you came on, 
knock on the door with a lost and woebegone look on your 
face (that second part is very important), and when the 
driver asks what you want, ask him (as cute and perkily as 
possible) to take you to the bus garage. If you do this right 
(it helps to be female), he will agree. And then, the more 
interesting part of your adventure will begin: your jour
ney to where the buses sleep.
Talking with the bus driver during this journey will 
liven things up a bit. If you ask the right questions, youll 
get fun stories about the time his bus was stormed by 
three police officers in search of a murder suspect, or 
about the homeless man who threw ice cream at his fellow 
passengers. If you continue in this vein, you should reach 
the garage in what feels like no time at all.
What happens when you get there is up to you. You can 
wait quietly for a ride back in the dark outer hallway, look
ing through the windows to the high-ceilinged, well-lit, 
off-limits bus driver lounge, which is replete with largescreen TV and ping-pong table; or you can go outside and 
have a look around. Please note: it is better to get permis
sion for the second option, to avoid unpleasant run-ins 
with employees.
If you were to choose to wander, you would see many 
interesting things. Hundreds of perfectly identical buses 
lined up in neatly symmetrical, slightly creepy rows. 
Massive buses up on jacks floating 15 feet above the 
ground. A bus wash  like a car wash, only bigger and 
cooler. A very, very large man with a very, very large han
dlebar mustache who looks kind of like Mr. T, popping up 
suddenly out of nowhere and demanding to know what 
the hell you think youre doing there. This is where the 
asking permission part becomes important  it helps to 
be able to throw around names.
There are however, definitely a finite number of things 
to see and do. Eventually, you will grow tired of wander
ing, and, glancing at your watch, notice that a consider
able amount of time has passed. When this happens, no 
need to panic  simply go back to the aforementioned 
lounge and ask one of the nice men watching Sportscenter 
if hes going in your general direction any time soon. They 
are generally quite obliging, and though it may be by a 
longish and roundabout route, theyll get you where you 
need to go.

There may be many different bus drivers, too many to 
remember, but theyre all on constant alert. For some driv
ers the route changes daily, and at all times it is necessary 
to stay alert for the sudden moves other drivers sometimes 
make.
Ed, a 61C driver, pointed out that though it can be diffi
cult, all the bus drivers are experienced and well-trained. 
He described being a bus driver as being the captain of a 
ship, adding that drivers are aware of their duties and 
train themselves to do what is necessary to fulfill them. On 
rainy days they have to be extra careful, he said, between 
the wet leaves and the increased number of passengers. 
His schedule changes daily, but he sees some familiar 
faces on his routes.
Another 61C driver said he drives the same route for 
three months at a time, before changing to a new route. 
The change of pace is good, and when hes doing his regu
lar route he gets to know his passengers well enough to say 
hello. One passenger even got to know him well enough 
that the passenger gave him two hard-boiled eggs, which 
he had in his pocket. Not all the passengers are that easy 
to get along with, however. He recalled how just recently 
he had to call the police twice. When the drivers are on 
their half-hour lunch breaks, they share stories of the 
unusual things that happen during the day. They enjoy 
being able to have listeners who can actually relate to 
what they experience every day.
Neither driver had a favorite route, as each route and 
each day bring different things. Both felt that safety was 
paramount, and theres always pressure to drive safely, 
though its not usually a problem other than rain and 
crowds making it tricky.

MWiC
New American guitarist
The ever-touring Dan Dern returns to Pittsburgh
Dan Bern heard Bob Dylans 
Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat at age 
14 and the ex-cellist never looked 
back. Bringing a world filled with 
the discontents of modernity and 
mass-culture obsession to his 
music, Bern has been hailed as this 
folk nations saving grace since the 
release of the six-song EP Dog Boy 
Van. Berns sharp wit, irreverence, 
and insight will show up at 
Rosebud Friday night at 8 pm.
I would like to write songs like 
Van Gogh and paint like Willie 
Mays and ride a bike across 
Australia, says Bern, who recently 
started painting and considers it as 
important to him as writing songs. 
Bern is an old-school troubadour, 
with Dylans warble, wordsmanship. Berns stories follow him all 
over the country. His latest record, 
New American Language (Messenger), 
features a fearless, darkly comic 
approach, equally a drunken shag
gy dog sing-along and a sardonic 
cross-country drive.
Berns lyrics are joyous and 
appealing. He maintains the irrev
erence of his predecessors, turning 
pop references on their heads. Like 
the young vagabond Dylan and his 
predecessor Woody Guthrie, the 
songs emerge from the part of 
American life that is b^Jconic 
and quotidian  he wonders if 
Marilyn Monroe should have mar
ried Henry Miller instead of 
Arthur Miller, or what would have 
happened if God allowed him to 
go back in time to save Kurt 
Cobains life. Fighting with the 
soft traditions of contemporary 
folk, Bern maintains toughness, 
honesty, and rage. The lyrics are 
street-smart, punctuated by the 
fierce licks of his acoustic guitar.
However, the language is less 
punchy and angry than the 
albums predecessors.
From a personal standpoint, 
the period that produced these 
songs was a period of tremendous 
change and upheaval. Some of it 
has to do with going to Lithuania,
where my Dad and his family were 
from, he said.
No longer just one of the guys 
with a guitar and a story to tell, 
Bern and his supporting band, The
While the albums may be bril
liant slabs of work, they do not 
compare to Berns live show.
If I had any goal with this
International Jewish Banking 
Conspiracy, play 21 instruments, 
including a didgeridoo and the 
Cellocaster, a six-stringed instru
ment invented by band member 
Paul Kuhn.
I think that in some of these 
songs Im less concerned with the 
arrow pointing at myself. I think 
Im more comfortable with myself 
and dont feel the need to posture 
or point at myself. God Said No 
is a crystallization of ideas Ive 
been trying to get right for a long 
time.
The shows are all about right 
now, Bern continued. Theres no 
yesterday and no tomorrow, and it 
doesnt matter whos not here. Its 
only about right now and who is 
here. Record making is so differ
ent. There are so many technical 
parts of it.

album, it was to make an album 
thats as good an album as the 
shows. Not to make a replica of the 
shows. But to make an album, 
thats as good an album, as the 
shows are as shows. I sometimes 
have to remind myself that 
[theyre] for me too. Performing a 
lot, people tell you what they want 
to hear, they yell out songs, write 
you notes. And you dont want to 
disappoint anybody, Bern said. 
The interaction makes for new 
spontaneous stuff that you never 
would have come up with your
self. But you have to balance it 
with yourself. You have to do the 
new songs that are close to you 
even if people shout for the old 
standard. [If you dont play for 
yourself] youll have nothing left, 
and the wells dry and theres no 
more songs and no more you.

Q and Not U
Second impressive album from post-punk heroes
In an underground music 
scene suffering from the soulsucking devices of mainstream 
music, it is nice to see a band 
playing music that is truly alive. 
That band is Q and not U. These 
post-punk pioneers hailing from 
Washington, D.C. have the kind 
of emotion and vitality that war
rants the bands status as repre
sentatives of the new blood in the 
Dischord Records family.
Under the wise tutelage of 
Fugazis Ian McKaye, the everinnovative staple of the under
ground, Q and not U have crafted 
Different Damage, an album that 
showcases their musical and lyri
cal progression. Different Damage 
is not a concept album, but is very 
conceptual  the songs tonally 
fluctuate like the inhale and 
exhale of an existential body.
Common themes permeate the 
songs, making the album a mean
ingful manifesto of the untainted 
self against a sick society. 
Literally instrumental, the lyrics 
complement the music with a 
poeticism that is not merely a 
vacant product of the patented 
rock n roll rhyming dictionary, 
but a calculated, syntactical 
assault on the cerebrum.
Immediately evident from the 
first song is the albums danceable, emotionally communicative 
rhythms. The drumming wavers 
from sustained syncopation to a 
slow, methodical tempo and 
roots every song with rhythmic 
resonance. Guitar and bass 
accentuate the drumbeats spar
ingly with incremental pauses, 
isolated riffs, and percussive 
qualities atypical to the instru
ments. The guitars ferocious, 
grating sound often merges into a 
melodic harmony at the urging of 
a mutating drumbeat, the social
subtext of the lyrics remaining 
intact.
Different Damage commences 
with an aesthetically pleasing 
spelling out of the words, Soft 
pyramids evaporate at daylight, 
and thus sets the precedent for 
the albums preternatural explo
ration of the linguistic landscape. 
While serving as musical notes 
themselves, the lyrics are rife 
with vocally veiled social com
mentary like, Were working in a 
coma for a cheque and a chance. 
The song, Meet Me in the 
Pocket, ends with rhythmic 
chanting, Dance or hang it up.
Playing self-described organic 
dance music, Q and not U com
bines disparate forms of music in 
a danceable dynamism that sticks 
in your head like sonic shrapnel. 
Beginning with a discordant, 
ambient intro, the song 
Everybody Ruins, moves into a 
fast, hard punk rock rhythm sup
plemented by a lyrical diatribe of 
angst. Following this is the slow, 
soft song Snow Patterns that 
seems nocturnal in its soothing 
tones and melodic intelligence. 
The next song, When the Lines 
Go Down, is a biting, sardonic 
account of the persistence of life 
after the death of technology and 
mobile communication culture.
The last song, Recreation 
Myth, is a reflective attack on 
the quantity-crazed, post-mod
ernistic world. Layered drum
beats, passionate singing, and 
give-and-take bass and guitar 
harmonies accompany the exis
tential ethic of the lyrics, as the 
song, much like the album, wan
ders from a deliberate, pulsing 
tempo to dramatic climax and 
closure.

A PORTRAIT OF OUR NATIONS HISTORY

THE BIRTH OF A NATION
Vampire Nation
Egyptian electrnica band celebrates double CD release
The Pacifics
Filipino-American hip-hop performance in Highlander Caf
So whats the latest music to come out of 
Luxor, Egypt? Arabic chants? Belly-dancing 
music? How about an eclectic mix of hiphop, electrnica, and darkwave? The latest 
offering from Pittsburgh-based Vampire 
Nation attempts to combine these seeming
ly disparate elements into a daring, new 
music genre. To celebrate the double CD 
release of their albums Eternal and The Birth 
of a Nation, the band will be playing at The 
Rex Theatre on Tuesday, November 19. The 
show will also feature Zombi and Acid 
Matrix.
Formed in 1994, Vampire Nation had its 
breakthrough hit in 1996 with Egyptian 
Sexmagik. The success of the song (it has 
appeared in some 17 compilations) put 
Vampire Nation on the map. In 1999, the 
band formed its own label, Hexagon 
Records, after a dispute with its record com
pany over the release of its first album, Coph 
Nia. The same year, the band gathered some 
negative press after it was found the perpe
trators of the Columbine Massacre listened 
to Vampire Nation. This prompted a govern
ment investigation, during which the FBI 
confiscated several Vampire Nation master 
tapes due to their allegedly controversial 
material. Though the court case is still in lit
igation, some of the confiscated material is 
featured in their latest release.
The music of Vampire Nation, though 
partly inspired by Egypt, veers away from 
the club-happy beats of rai and the catchy 
pop sound of al jeel, two popular MiddleEastern music genres. Of the two new 
albums, Eternal is by far the most diverse. 
The albums African rhythms, hip-hop, and 
trance elements come together to form a
unique hybrid. Eternal includes more per
cussion, said Vampire Nation frontman 
Fredrik Von Hamilton. Its theme is African 
culture.
This world fusion, though innovative, 
can sometimes sound jarring and uneven. 
The African chants of the albums third 
track, Monsoon, stand in stark contrast to 
the down-tempo hip-hop of Pyramid. The 
music takes a bit of getting used to, since 
rather than following a unified theme, the 
songs form a collage of distinct styles.
The Birth of a Nation features a smoother, 
more even style, as well as a political and 
historical undercurrent. The album traces 
the events leading up to the North-South 
split, the Civil War Era, the Emancipation, 
and the Reconstruction. The song titles (To 
the Cotton Fields, Gettysburg, and 
Reconstruction, among others) reflect 
this historical theme. The Birth of a Nation 
is an instrumental album, said Von 
Hamilton. It tells the story of how America 
was built by slave labor. This album is Von 
Hamilton at his best. The Birth of a Nation is 
a collage of complex, layered rhythms, 
ambient melodies, and gothic rock guitar 
riffs. The Gathering Storm, the albums 
seventh track, is especially good: an other
worldly trance jewel.
Vampire Nations two new releases place 
them at the forefront of the world fusion 
scene. Controversial or not, the bands 
music is some of the most innovative 
around.
The unlikely venue of Highlander Caf 
traded in a Taste of India for a taste of Asia 
Saturday night when Filipino-American hiphop group The Pacifics performed to a 
crowd of 75 people. The group presented an 
eclectic mix of jazzy, uptempo, downbeat, 
old school, and underground sounds that 
drew comparisons to groups like The Roots 
and Souls of Mischief. The Pacifics, whose 
name is an acronym for People 
Accumulating Creative Ideas Foregoing 
Ignorant Conclusions of Society, were 
brought to campus by the new Asian frater
nity Pi Delta Psi.
The Pacifics  DJ Norman Rockwell, MC 
Strike 3, and MC/Producer KP  tried to get 
the crowd moving and into the beat. As 
many in the crowd had never witnessed an 
Asian hip-hop group, they did not know 
what to expect from the Pacifics. As it 
turned out, they brought to the table 
straight hip-hop that everyone could enjoy. 
They mixed comedy with brag rhymes, such 
as when KP referred to himself as the 
Thrilla from Manila (though he and the 
group are from Chicago) during his 
freestyle. Most of their set was simply rap
ping about hip-hop and what it means to 
them. Things came together in the middle of 
the show when the crowd cast the chairs 
aside and couldnt resist bouncing to the
infectious beats.
The highlight of the show was the 
freestyle, with Strike 3 and KP going back 
and forth rhyming about everything, includ
ing references to Carnegie Mellon and 
Pittsburgh. Their songs displayed variety 
and creativity, which was attributable to a 
long list of influences that includes dozens 
of hip-hop groups.
We even go beyond hip-hop to other gen
res of music. We take ideas from Miles Davis 
and Stevie Wonder to Radiohead and the 
Red Hot Chili Peppers, said KP. The 
Pacifics, which has been together since 
1995, dont consider themselves as an exclusively-Asian group. As Strike 3 said, We 
cater to people who love hip-hop. We make 
our music for anyone to listen to.
Still, their race does play a role in their 
mission and in their fan base. [We] defi
nitely help other Asians to step up and be 
more creative and do more in hip-hop 
instead of limiting themselves to being DJs 
and b-boys [break dancers] instead of MCing. We want to help provide that outlet, 
said Strike 3.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
The great philosoduck, Quackers, once told me the 
most stirring words, which I shali never forget. We were 
at the time relaxing together by the pond while munching on saltine crackers, and he turned towards me sud
denly and raised an eyebrow, as best any duck ever could 
raise an eyebrow. He then said to me, Quack quack quack quack. Quack 
quackity quackquack quack; quack quack. Quack! Quack quack, quack 
quack quackity quack  quack quack. Quack? Quack. I sat there speechless 
for a moment, pondering this deep statement. Needless to say, I took his 
advice.
The Phatmaster
I was a young white 
aspiring coder who lived in 
a trailer park outside 
Detroit. My "hacker name 
(used on web boards and 
chat rooms) was "P. Master".
me97 Vol ,Ils

In an improvisational coding 
session which took place 
later in a parking loot, I 
attracted the attention of 
a skank played by Brittany 
Murphy ("Clueless").
Before I could make it big, 
I had to save up the cash 
for a laptop, so I got a 
job in data entry.
Brittany's true skankiness 
was revealed when she 
screwed another upstart, 
"BillG, who was obviously 
coding only for the money.
I knew that I could bust 
routines with the best of 
them, but when I attended a 
competition, I froze up and 
was thoroughly humiliated.
I was determined to be 
better than Bill, and at 
the next competition, my 
implementation of binary 
search was so elegant, his 
cronies couldn't even 
respond. But while I 
celebrated my victory, he 
was negotiating the DOS 
contract with IBM. At 
least I have my pride.

soon become more difficult to operate the machinery in 
shop, as long as you still have your thumbs youll be fine.

complaining until after it starts snowing 
and your roommate breaks a window.
?isces./PISCES (February 19 - March 20): While 
fame, success and fortune may elude you, 
think of how much free food you will get as t
