From January 24 to 26, an esti
mated 4,000 local and regional 
activists will descend on Oakland 
for the Regional Convergence 
Against War.
The three-day event, hosted by 
Pittsburgh Organizing Group (POG) 
and the Thomas Merton Center, will 
be packed with protests, street the
ater, vigils, live music, and food, and 
will be the largest local peace mobi
lization in ten years, according to 
POG.
The rally is a collective effort of 
more than 55 endorsers, including 
CMUs Progressive Student Alliance. 
Twenty-eight bands are appearing, 
as well as numerous speakers who 
will lead teach-ins and lectures. 
Local churches are providing free 
housing and shelter to escape the 
cold weather during the day. Free 
food will also be provided by 
Pittsburgh Food Not Bombs.
The Regional Convergence 
Against War came about in an effort 
to stop the Bush Administration 
after several failed attempts to con
tact legislators and thousands of 
phone calls, said Tim Vining, the 
executive director of the Thomas 
Merton Center, a Pittsburgh non
profit peace and justice organiza
tion that will co-host of the rally 
with Pittsburgh Organizing Group.
According to Vining, busloads of 
activists are coming from as far 
away as Cleveland and Boston.
Much time and preparation is 
going into the rally.

RIAA monitors student downloads;

A seemingly innocent download of the popular Disney 
film Monsters, Inc. gave one student a firsthand demon
stration of Carnegie Mellons copyright policies.
First-year H&SS student Nayoung Joe was participating 
in what has become a fixture in college dorm rooms 
across the country when on December 12 she received a 
surprising email. Computing Services informed her that 
the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) was 
able to download copyrighted material off of her comput
er, and that Computing Services would suspend her 
Internet service for at least one full semester.
She thought a simple apology would correct the matter, 
but when Joe responded to the email, she was told she 
must wait at least one semester before CMU would con
sider reinstating her access.
I didn't know about the consequences, said Joe.
John Lerchey, computer and network security coordi
nator, said incidents of piracy and copyright infringement 
via the Internet are becoming far too common on campus, 
averaging about three to five reports per week. These 
reports come from organizations, like the MPAA, RIAA 
(Recording Industry Association of America), and copy
right holders.
According Lerchey and Paul Fowler, associate dean of 
student affairs, the University does not actively search out 
violators of copyright law.
In most cases, including Joes, a copyright owner or 
organization will present evidence to the University that a 
student is distributing copyrighted materials. 
Organizations such as the MPAA and the RIAA download 
copyrighted materials from students machines, and then 
present documentation in the form of an IP address, a 
unique four number address separated by periods that 
identifies computers on a network. Although CMU has a

Concern is growing among MBA 
students as GSIAs decision to start 
an integrated program between CIT 
and GSIA slowly becomes a reality. 
Starting this fall, GSIAs MBA pro
gram will begin granting early 
acceptance to CIT undergraduates 
 a decision which has given pause 
to many current GSIA students, 
who are anxious about the qualifi
cations of the CIT undergraduates.
Traditionally, MBA programs 
require applicants to have several 
years of work experience before 
entering. Many MBA programs 
focus on students relating their 
real-world experience to what is 
taught in the classroom. In its 
admissions literature, GSIA says it 
does not require any post-undergraduate work experience, though 
the average student works for 
about five years before entering the 
program.
According to John Mather, the 
executive director of Carnegie 
Mellons MBA program, work expe
rience isnt always necessary for an 
MBA student to be successful.
Mather said that the question 
largely concerned the age differSee GSIA/CIT, page A4

The Center for University Out
reach exists no longer.
Though it rarely drew attention 
within the Carnegie Mellon com
munity, the Center served as an 
umbrella organization for outreach 
programs at the University for 
nearly a decade. Administration 
closed the center in June, at the 
end of the fiscal year, because it 
couldnt afford to keep Outreach 
on the University budget.
The Center supported faculty in 
developing outreach projects and 
courses, while serving as a hub of 
information between the city and 
the University. As a network of 
individuals based both on and off 
campus, the Center worked to 
bring together faculty with com
munity organizations that could 
benefit from the help of Carnegie 
Mellon students.
It was ideal to have the Center 
to generate options and support 
others, said Linda Flower, the 
Center's former co-director.
According to Indira Nair, vice 
provost of education, a new 
umbrella campus outreach organi
zation will soon be developed to 
replace the Center. Nair said that 
the original Center was not used to 
its potential and had not recently 
generated many new and success
ful programs. Also, she said it was 
unclear whether many students 
bothered to access the information 
provided by the Center.
Nair cited many examples of out
reach programs at Carnegie Mellon 
that continue today, including the 
Carnegie Mellon Institute for 
Talented Elementary Students 
(CMITES), the Role Models pro
gram and the Chemistry Science 
Van. These three programs are the 
most successful and long-lived on 
campus and are funded almost 
entirely by outside sources. In fact, 
almost all outreach efforts at the 
University are funded by grants 
and donations from either private 
foundations or the state.
In the past, most programs have 
focused on local elementary and 
secondary schools. Under the 
name The Center for Elementary 
and Secondary School Outreach 
(CESSO), organizations like 
CMITES, Role Models and the 
Science Van will operate as the 
core of the Universitys outreach 
efforts. Within a year, Nair plans to 
have a new website running that 
will pair those in need in the com
munity with faculty, staff and stu
dents at the University. Essentially, 
the University has reorganized and 
renamed the former Center for 
University Outreach, but lacks 
funding to hire the staff needed to 
complete the restructuring.
CESSO will be organized like the

Allegheny County health inspec
tors visited La Prima in Wean Hall 
last Thursday, and following the 
inspection, posted a consumer alert 
warning of a possible health hazard 
at the establishment.
Guillermo Cole, Health Depart
ment public information officer, 
said that consumer alerts are posted 
to reinforce health codes.
If we see violations that pose 
imminent danger to consumer 
health, well close [the establish
ment] down, said Cole.
Parkhurst, which runs CMUs din
ing services and manages, but does 
not own La Prima, was unaware of 
the alert until officials were contact
ed by The Tartan last Friday.
When The Tartan visually inspect
ed the establishment on Friday, a 
sign regarding changed hours dur
ing Martin Luther King Day had 
been hung such that it obscured the 
yellow consumer alert placard.
Upon learning of the alert, 
Parkhurst Manager Jane Fahringer
ordered the establishment closed 
until the violations were resolved. 
The sign obscuring the alert was 
also removed.
According to the Allegheny 
County Health inspection report, 
the establishment was in violation 
of cold holding, sanitization, ; 
toxic items labeled, stored or used, 
and certified manager regula
tions.
La Prima was also cited for 
obtaining water in an unsanitary 
manner.
The report said, Spinach and 
cheese foccacia and artichoke, 
cheese, and roasted pepper foccacia 
out at room temperature 57-58 
degrees.
Health regulations require this 
type of food to be held at 41 degrees.
The inspector also found that 
dishes and utensils were not washed 
with soapy water, and that the anti
bacterial solution used for washing 
did not meet the county's standard.
At the time of the inspection, a certi
fied food handler was also not pre
sent.
Nonviolence training is available 
for those interested in participating 
in the direct action: sign marching, 
protesting, blockades, sit-ins, dieins, and dramatization of war. 
Participants are also being taught 
protest tactics and peaceful strate
gies of protest that will help prevent 
civil disobedience from yielding vio
lence.
Police arrests have been 
arranged beforehand for symbolic 
purposes, said Vining. "We are 
committed to a peaceful protest but 
are going to be very up front with 
the police. We hope they respect 
that.
We are not trying to endorse civil 
disobedience, said Quinten 
Steenhuis, a junior Logic 
Computation major and a member 
of the Progressive Student Alliance. 
We are just trying to represent the 
mainstream opinion and this rally is 
the last chance to say it loudly that 
we are against the war in Iraq.
PSA members have attended the 
nonviolence training sessions and 
will be recruiting CMU students to 
attend the rallies. A group of CMU 
drama students will also be per
forming some satirical street the
atre.

Peaceful march floods capital

Assistamt News Editor
WASHINGTON, D.C.  On Sat
urday, activists thronged the mall on 
the west side of the Capitol building 
to protest US military action in Iraq. 
The protest, organized by 
A.N.S.W.E.R. (Act Now to Stop War 
and End Racism) included a small 
but tenacious pack of CMU students. 
A.N.S.W.E.R. formed shortly after 
September 11 and has since been 
scheduling and funding protests 
throughout the country.
The rally began with appearances 
from the Reverend Al Sharpton, Patti 
Smith, musical group Chumbawumba, Ron Kovic (author of Born 
on the Fourth of July), actress Jessica 
Lange, and the Reverend Jesse 
Jackson. At 1 pm, the group began 
the walk from Capitol Hill down 
Independence Avenue, Pennsylvania
Avenue, 8th Street, and ended on M 
Street, passing in front of the 
Washington Navy Yard, a large 
Washington military installation. At 
the conclusion of the march, more 
speakers were heard at a closing 
rally.
The number of protesters has been 
estimated at anywhere from 100,000 
to 500,000, according to 
A.N.S.W.E.R. spokespeople. But even 
the most conservative estimate 
makes Saturdays demonstration the 
largest anti-war protest that 
Washington, D.C. has seen since the 
Vietnam War.
Counter-protests are common at 
politically-charged events like this 
one, but Saturdays event was sur
prisingly peaceful, especially consid
ering the number of people present.
This has been a pretty easy day, 
said first-class private J.P. Hornauer, 
one of the many guards standing 
ready to suppress an unruly mob. Its
been a peaceful demonstration. 
Were here to protect these people 
from a counter-demonstration, but I 
havent seen anything yet.
Because of his role, Hornauer was 
unable to state his own views on the 
war, but stressed the importance of 
protecting the people's right to 
express their opinions.
Everyone should be able to do it, 
and say what they want, as long as 
they follow the rules, he said.
Along with the Capitol police and a 
number of volunteer security guards 
provided by A.N.S.W.E.R., the CDU 
(Civil Disturbance Unit) was present. 
This unit was formed specifically to 
serve at group demonstrations and, 
as one officer said, to be the riot 
police.
The only heckling the protesters 
had to endure happened as the crowd 
moved past a headquarters building

Husseins call to 
arms rallies people
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  A defiant 
Saddam Hussein called on his people 
Friday to rise up and defend the 
nation against a new US-led attack 
,and. promised that Iraqs enemies 
would face suicide at the gates of 
hi capital.
The 40-minute televised address, 
delivered on the 12th anniversary of 
the Gulf War, revealed no sign that 
Saddam was prepared to step down 
or' bow to demands of the United 
.Nations, which has sent inspectors to 
determine if Iraq has given up its 
'wapons of mass destruction.
Meanwhile, the White House said 
the discovery by inspectors of 12 
empty rocket warheads capable of 
'carrying chemical weapons was 
"'troubling and serious.
But spokesman Ari Fleischer 
stopped short of calling the weapons 
a Violation of UN resolutions.
The rockets, found Thursday in 
southern Iraq, were not listed in Iraqs 
wapons declaration, Fleischer said. 
When asked if the discovery repre
sented a smoking gun proving 
Saddam has hidden weapons, he 
said. The fact that Iraq is in posses
sion of undeclared chemical war
heads ... is troubling and serious.
Iraq claims the warheads are old 
and were listed in earlier disclosures 
of the countrys weapons.
It was not clear when Saddam 
recorded the address, but in it he did 
not mention the warhead discovery.
. 'In Paris, French President Jacques 
Chirac met with chief UN weapons 
inspector Hans Blix and head nuclear 
inspector Mohamed El Baradei and 
supported their request for additional 
time to complete their mission.
The EUs top foreign policy official, 
Javier Solana, also said inspectors 
should have more time, but he said he 
believes that there is no need to pass 
a second UN resolution to approve 
any military action against Iraq, a 
stance that many European leaders 
disagree with.
i The United States, which says no 
new resolution is needed, has threat
ened military action if Iraq fails to 
; prove it has given up weapons of mass 
destruction.
On Friday, Saddam vowed to beat 
'back any invasion.
The people of Baghdad have 
resolved to compel the Mongols of 
this age to commit suicide on its 
' walls, Saddam said, referring to the
United States. Everyone who tries to 
climb over its walls ... will fail in his 
attempt.
He said the Iraqi nation was fully 
mobilized against the threat of a new 
conflict and told President Bush to 
keep your evil away from the mother 
of civilization.
The whole nation will rise in 
defense of its right to live, Saddam 
said. Their [aggressors] arrows will 
go astray or backfire, God willing.
Long live Palestine, free and Arab, 
from the [Mediterranean] sea to the 
[Jordan] river, Saddam said, in an 
appeal for Arab support.
Saddam didnt refer to Bush by 
name but alluded to him as Hologu, 
the grandson of Genghis Khan, who 
destroyed Baghdad and killed its 
ruler in 1258.
Repeated references to Baghdad, 
rather than Iraq, appeared to be a 
sign that Saddam plans to rally his 
troops around the capital for a deci
sive battle aimed at inflicting as many 
casualties as possible on US forces.
On January 17, 1991, a US-led 
coalition launched devastating air 
attacks against Baghdad and other 
Iraqi cities, opening Operation Desert 
Storm, which drove Iraqi invaders out 
of Kuwait.
Saddam has depicted the events of 
1991 as a victory because Iraq stood 
up to a superpower and his regime 
survived invasion and subsequent 
uprisings.
South Korea urges 
US to diplomacy
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  South 
Koreas president-elect pressed the 
United States on Friday to enter direct 
negotiations with North Korea, and 
an envoy from Russia  which has 
been urged to intervene with the 
North  said Washington must take 
the lead in dealing with the crisis.
A North Korean official also said 
only the United States could solve the 
standoff and spurned an attempt by 
Seoul to discuss the Norths nuclear 
ambitions in talks next week.
Washington has been canvassing 
its allies to put pressure on North 
Korea to scrap nuclear programs 
believed capable of building nuclear 
weapons.
President Bush has said the United 
States is willing to talk with the 
North, but not hold negotiations over 
its nuclear program  an offer 
Pyongyang said was insincere. Bush 
has held out the possibility of energy 
and agricultural aid if the North 
abandons its nuclear plans but 
refused to make any guarantees.
US pilot accused of 
killing Canadians
; BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, La.
. (AP).A US pilot charged with invol
untary manslaughter in the acciden
tal bombing deaths of four Canadians 
in Afghanistan was under orders to 
hold fire when he dropped the bomb, 
a fellow airman testified Friday.
Major John Milton testified in a 
hearing to determine whether two 
.members of his Illinois National 
;Guard squadron should be courtmartialed for the friendly fire inci
dent last spring. Majors Harry
 Schmidt and William Umbach face up 
to 64 years in a military prison if con
victed.
- On a videotape of the bombing 
played by Air Force lawyers on Friday, 
,a flight controller is heard saying 
hold fire after Schmidt requests 
permission to fire his 20 millimeter 
cannons. Schmidt had spotted fire on 
the ground and thought Umbach was 
under attack.
Milton testified that the order 
meant Schmidt must refrain from 
attacking.
Four seconds after the order, 
Schmidt dropped the guided bomb, 
killing the four Canadians, who had 
been performing anti-tank exercises 
with live ammunition. Eight other 
soldiers on the ground were wound
ed.
Five of the survivors have testified 
! at the hearing that they were not fir
ing into the air at the time.
 Defense attorneys have said that 
the pilots thought they were under 
Tire from the Taliban or al Qaida and 
;that a breakdown in communications 
prevented the pilots from knowing 
1 allied troops were in the area.
[ The proceeding is akin to a civilian
 grand jury hearing.
 In testimony late Thursday, Milton 
isaid the gunfire that Schmidt saw did 
inot appear to be anti-aircraft
artillery. Milton also said Schmidt 
was flying too low and too slow.
Tactical guidelines direct pilots to 
fly faster and higher to escape anti
aircraft artillery, Air Force officials 
have said.
US officials shocked 
by Iraqs weapons
WASHINGTON (AP)  The White 
House on Friday called the discovery 
of chemical warheads in Iraq trou
bling and serious, and said the cache 
had not been declared by Saddam 
Husseins government as required by 
UN rules.
Presidential spokesman Ari 
Fleischer stopped short of calling the 
12 empty chemical warheads a smok
ing gun or a violation of an anti-arms 
UN resolution. American allies 
expressed less alarm over the discov
ery, and urged patience from 
Washington.
French President Jacques Chirac, 
whose. country holds veto power at 
the United Nations, said he supports 
giving UN inspectors more time to 
determine whether Iraq still has 
weapons of mass destruction. The 
head of UN nuclear agency, 
Mohamed ElBaradei, said it would be 
worth taking a few more months to 
search if that would prevent a war.
And chief UN inspector Hans Blix 
said he still wasnt sure whether the 
warheads were mentioned in Iraqs 
12,000-page weapons declaration, 
submitted last month, in which 
Baghdad was required to account for 
all components of its biological, 
chemical, and nuclear weapons pro
grams. Iraq said the weapons were 
listed in the declaration, an assertion 
firmly disputed by Fleischer.
The chemical warheads found by 
the inspectors were not  not  on 
the declared list of weapons that Iraq 
issued just one month ago,-he said. 
The fact that Iraq is in possession of 
undeclared chemical warheads, 
which the United Nations says are in 
excellent condition, is troubling and 
serious.

Death row petition 
making progress
CHICAGO (U-WIRE)  A peti
tion drafted by two University of 
Chicago Law School students saw 
vindication when Governor George 
Ryan commuted the death sen
tences of all 167 inmates on death 
row in the state of Illinois during a 
speech at Northwestern University 
Law School on Saturday. The letter 
to the governor was signed by over 
140 students from law schools 
throughout the state.
Weve worked non-stop all fall, 
said Elizabeth Erickson, a law stu
dent and co-author of the petition 
to Ryan. You sort of feel like 
youve had a victory this past 
Saturday but youre not done.
Ryans announcement, which 
came at the end of his controversial 
term, was his second of the week
end.
On Friday Ryan pardoned four 
inmates while speaking at DePaul 
Law School.
I believe he did it based on what 
he thought was the right thing to 
do, said Jennifer Escalante, co
author of the petition and a law 
student who works at the 
MacArthur Center for Justice, of 
the governors blanket commuta
tion.
University of Chicago law stu
dents were part of a larger network 
of university students in Illinois 
working on behalf of death row 
inmates. Two classes at
Northwestern University had been 
working on the exoneration of two 
death row inmates for the past sever
al years. Both men, Aaron Patterson 
and Leroy Orange, were pardoned on 
Friday on account of having been 
forced to deliver false confessions.
The Illinois capital punishment 
system is broken, Ryan said in the 
speech. He went on to quote former 
Supreme Court Justice Harry 
Blackmun, saying, From this day for
ward I no longer shall tinker with the 
machines of death.
The student-led effort was support
ed by strong advocacy among faculty 
at law schools throughout the state 
and was praised for its initiative. What the law students did was quite 
wonderful. Its important for law stu
dents to make their voices heard, 
that they went across the state and 
gathered so many signatures, said 
Jean Maclean Snyder, lecturer at the 
University Law School and the 
MacArthur Justice Center. On the 
motivation of Ryans final actions, 
there has been praise as well as sus
picion.
He is currently being investigated 
for a scandal dealing with drivers 
licenses granted in exchange for 
bribes while he was secretary of state, 
and some have suggested that he 
used the death penalty as an opportu
nity to deflect personal criticism. 
Still, many maintain that Ryans 
actions were larger than any personal 
issue.

role in the immediate treatment of 
wounded American soldiers.
Energy Storage Technologies 
Inc., a thermal management com
pany based in Dayton, Ohio, has 
utilized phase-change material 
patented by retired UDRI research 
scientist Ivan Salyer to develop a 
new refrigerator called HemaCool 
that will make it easier to store and 
transport blood. At this time, the 
US Army plans to replace its out
dated thermoelectric blood-trans
port refrigerators with those being 
produced by EST.
Blood transportation has always 
been a difficult task, especially in 
areas prone to extreme tempera
tures, because of the specific tem
perature levels at which transport
ed blood must remain. 
Thermoelectric refrigerators have 
a lower refrigerant capacity to stay 
at the necessary temperature, said 
Lloyd Huff, president and chief 
executive officer of EST.
Our refrigerator can cool blood 
down much faster and operate over 
a wider range of temperatures, 
Huff said.
Another advantage of the 
HemaCool when compared to the 
thermoelectric refrigerators being 
used now is the HemaCool can 
maintain a constant temperature 
for four hours even when it is with
out power. This allows the blood to 
be transported to remote areas that 
may be without convenient power 
sources. This four-hour hold over 
time can be maintained in areas 
with temperatures up to 120 
degrees Fahrenheit.

Heinz announces 
voter party switch
Pittsburgh, PA (AP)  When 
Republican Teresa Heinz criticized 
Rick Santorum during his 1994 US 
Senate race, the head of the 
Allegheny County GOP was so 
miffed that she spoke against the 
partys candidate, he sent her the 
paperwork to change her voter 
registration. Eight years later, shes 
actually doing it. Heinz is becom
ing a registered Democrat, after 
more than three decades as a 
Republican.
Heinz, 64, the widow of the late 
US Senator John Heinz, 
Republican, Pennsylvania, made 
the decision this week, in part so 
she can vote for her husband, US 
Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat, 
Massachusetts, in Pennsylvanias 
Democratic primary next year. 
Kerry is seeking the Democratic 
nomination for president. Heinz 
said the Republican Party she 
joined in 1971 no longer exists and 
she is particularly distressed about 
its positions on the environment.
Heinz, who is registered to vote 
at Rosemont Farms in Fox Chapel, 
filled out the paperwork to change 
her registration. It will be either 
mailed to or dropped off at the 
Allegheny County Elections 
Division in the next few days, said 
Chris Black, her spokeswoman.
Shes a very independent spir
it, Black said. Shes felt for a long 
time the Republican Party is leav
ing her.
Black said that in addition to the 
environment, Heinz is concerned 
about issues such as inclusion, tol
erance and civility, which she sees 
as lacking in the Republican Party.
Because of those sentiments, 
and with her husband running for 
president, it made sense to change 
her affiliation now.
It was really the right time, 
Black said.
Rich Stampahar, chairman of 
the Allegheny County Republican 
Party, said he was not surprised.
She was married to a 
Republican and she was a 
Republican. Now shes married to 
a Democrat, so I guess its appro
priate, he said.
FBI probes local 
shootings further
PITTSBURGH (AP)  The FBI 
has expanded its probe in the 
death of a Uniontown boy to 
include the police-related deaths 
of two African-American men in 
the Pittsburgh area, city 
Councilman Sala Udin said yester
day. Udin received a letter Friday 
from Assistant Special Agent in 
Charge Roland J. Corvington, who 
said the FBI was expanding its 
investigation to include the death 
of Charles Dixon after a scuffle 
with the police, and the shooting 
death of Bernard Rogers 
November 15 by Pittsburgh 
Housing Authority police. The FBI 
and state police are already inves

Fire hazard found 
in cellular phones
KENT, Ohio (U-WIRE)  It takes 
three things to start a static elec
tricity fire  vapors, air and a 
spark. This can create a hazard 
when pumping gas because the 
vapors and air already are there, 
and a spark may not be far behind.
The number of concerns about 
static electricity causing fires at gas 
stations has risen since early 1999. 
Static electricity builds in a cool, 
dry climate. This makes winter the 
prime time for static fires.
While it is common that static 
electricity can build when a person 
slides across a plastic car seat, a 
cell phone can also cause static 
sparks.
I had no clue that talking on 
your cell phone could cause a fire, 
said Melissa Call, senior history 
major at Kent State University.
Shammara Blanchard, a gas 
clerk for Sunoco on State Route 59, 
said he has seen customers using 
their cell phones while pumping 
gasoline.
Some cell phone manuals even 
warn owners against dialing or 
answering calls in fueling areas.
Most gas pumps have warning 
labels that include turning off the 
car engine, not smoking and not 
re-entering the vehicle. Only a 
few stations provide warnings 
against cell phone use.
Local bars value 
students opinions
TUSCALOOSA, Alabama (UWIRE)  While the decision to 
limit the hours of operation at 
Tuscaloosas bars still lies in the 
hands of the Tuscaloosa City 
Council, the University of 
Alabama Student Government 
Association Senate officially gave 
its thumbs up to any such move 
on Thursday night.
Resolution 41-02, which 
strongly encourages the 
Tuscaloosa City Council to estab
lish reasonable hours of opera
tion for all bars during the week 
[with] no set hours of operation 
on Friday, was passed by a 
majority of senators at their first 
meeting of the semester.
The resolution was not without 
opposition, however, as Graduate 
School Senator Brandon Owens 
challenged the resolution several 
times during its debate, charging 
that limiting the operating hours 
for local bars would have adverse 
effects on Tuscaloosas economy.

West Coast campus 
expands further
CMU and NASA (National 
Aeronautics and Space
Administration) have agreed on a 
long-term lease by which the univer
sity will acquire and refurbish 19,000 
square feet of space for its steadily 
expanding West Coast campus in 
Buildings 23 and 24 on the historic 
Shenandoah Plaza at Moffett Field, 
California.
The space sits beside NASAs Ames 
Research Center and belongs to a 
213-acre research park thats under 
development.
The agreement dictates that the 
university may lease the buildings for 
15 years and has the option to 
increase the term of the lease to 48 
years.
The lease also allows CMU to have 
the first say in leasing buildings 17 
and 20 on the six-building quadran
gle. The universitys West Coast cam
pus has been housed in Building 17 
since 2001. Now, growing programs 
are calling for more space. Building 
20 was used as an officers club on the 
former naval base and could house 50 
to 60 people, including students, vis
iting faculty and short-term visitors.
This agreement with NASA shows 
our commitment to our West Coast 
campus, and the value we believe it 
brings to the Silicon Valley communi
ty, said CMU president Jared Cohon.
We are delighted to sign this lease 
agreement with Carnegie Mellon 
University, one of the worlds premier 
institutions of higher education, 
especially in the area of computer sci
ence, said NASA Ames Center 
Director G. Scott Hubbard. This 
agreement marks a significant mile
stone in the evolution of the NASA 
Research Park. The combination of 
CMUs high dependability computing 
research focus and its new informa
tion technology graduate program 
will serve to advance NASAs mission 
as well as set the stage for broader
collaboration with Silicon Valleys 
high tech community.
Kamlet hires new 
CFO for University
Stefano Falconi, former director of 
finance at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT), is the new vice 
president of administration and chief 
financial officer at Carnegie Mellon 
University as of January 1. Falconi 
replaces acting CFO Bill Laird, after 
former CFO Jeff Bolton left CMU over 
the summer to work at the Mayo 
Foundation in Rochester, Minn.
One of Falconis first responsibili
ties as CFO will be to amend a $9 mil
lion budget shortfall. He is currently 
working on a budget proposal for the 
next fiscal year, due February 3. Mark 
Kamlet, provost, said CMU is facing a 
particularly rough year financially.
According to Kamlet, who headed 
the hiring committee that selected 
Falconi, Falconis role is to advise the 
President on budget matters, manage 
several offices including human 
resources and business services, and 
act as a senior advisor to the adminis
tration.
Prior to working at MIT, Falconi 
held several positions in finance at 
Harvard.
We felt extremely fortunate there 
was someone like him who was inter
ested in the position, said Kamlet. .
John Henriques, a budget officer at 
MIT who worked under Falconi for 
three years, said the people who 
worked with Falconi had a great deal 
of respect for him.
In terms of managing his depart
ment, he was very specific in what 
was needed, said Henriques. We 
always knew what was expected and 
when it was expected. There were 
very few surprises.
During his six years at MIT, Falconi 
implemented important changes, said 
Henriques, including putting together 
a budget book used by senior staff and 
budget committees that laid out com
plex financial plans.
He also developed a budget system 
that allowed the institution to track 
and manage their budget more effec
tively.
Chancellors pay 
will be raised 14%
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
University of Pittsburgh Chancellor 
Mark Nordenberg will receive a 14 
percent salary increase next year as 
a reward for what Nordenberg 
called in his 2002 budget report the 
most ambitious period of construc
tion in Pitts 215-year history.
Over the course of the past seven 
years, the chancellor and other 
senior officers of this University 
have led an alLout effort producing 
a dramatic transformation of the 
institution, said William Dietrich, 
compensation committee chair and 
chairman of the board of trustees, 
during a public committee meeting 
December 20, 2002.
The salary increases come during 
a period of rising tuition costs, 
which also grew 14 percent this 
year. A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette arti
cle on the salary increases spawned 
criticism of the university in an edi
torial and a letter to the editor.
Its a very, very miniscule portion 
of the tuition, Pitt spokesman 
Robert Hill said. It will have virtual
ly no impact.
Hoping to retain Pitts officers by 
offering more competitive salaries, 
the board hired the consulting firm 
Towers Perrin to survey salaries at 
peer universities and compare 
them to salaries at Pitt.
It was quite clear, particularly in 
the case of the chancellor, but also in 
the case of certain other officers, 
that action was required to close a 
growing compensation gap, Steve 
Pakela, of Towers Perrin, said.
Five other senior officers will 
receive between 5 and 11 percent 
salary increases at the recommenda
tion of the chancellor. Last years 
salary increases were significantly 
lower, with most officers, including 
the chancellor, receiving about a 5 
percent salary increase.
The current university adminis
tration was put in place during the 
last seven years to aggressively pur
sue an ambitious set of institutional 
goals, Dietrich said. Dietrich cited 
increased undergraduate applica
tions, improved applicant creden
tials, higher levels of research sup
port and what may have been [the 
universitys] most active and effec
tive period of community partner
ing as some of the universitys
recent accomplishments.
In addition to the salary increase, 
which raises Nordenbergs yearly 
salary from $342,500 to $390,000, 
Nordenberg will receive $75,000 per 
year as an annual deferred retention 
payment. Thr money, meant to 
encourage the chancellor to remain 
at Pitt, will be his if he stays in his 
position through June 30, 2007. 
Similar payments of $50,000 were 
offered to the other officers receiving 
raises.
Professors noose 
case is abandoned
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
Because of a lack of evidence, the FBI 
and University of Pittsburgh police 
have ended their investigation into 
the events surrounding the noose 
found behind the lectern of black pro
fessor Stefan Wheelock.
The noose, which Wheelock dis
covered before his November 21 
class, was found next to a copy of 
Ralph Ellisons The Invisible Man. 
Ellisons novel concerns race relations 
in America, and was required reading 
for Wheelocks introduction to critical 
reading course. Upon finding the 
book and noose, Pitt police were noti
fied and conducted a joint criminal 
investigation with the FBI.
A statement issued yesterday by 
the university explained that the 
noose was fashioned from the pull 
cord of a window shade, and one of 
the window shade pull cords in 
Wheelocks Crabtree Hall classroom 
had in fact been removed. However, 
numerous other shades throughout 
the building have had their pull cords 
similarly fashioned into nooses.
Robert Hill, Pitts vice chancellor 
for public affairs, explained, The 
pull cords had been made into nooses 
years ago by medical students to sym
bolize that they were being worked to 
death. It was young doctors goofing 
off.
Hill likened the original intent of 
the noose-makers to the pranks per
formed by the doctors on the televi
sion showM.A.S.H. Since the original 
nooses were made back when 
Wheelock was himself a student, he 
said, it was doubtful that they were 
intended as any kind of specific threat 
against him.
The book belonged to a female stu
dent in Wheelocks class who said she 
had accidentally left it behind the 
week before. Pitt police and FBI could 
not determine whether the position
ing of the book and this particular 
noose were related or intended as a 
threat.

GSIA/CIT integrated 
track source of concern
GSIA/CIT, from page A1Mather acknowledged that GSIA 
did not effectively communicate to 
its students the details of the new 
integrated program.
While his office is currently work
ing to restore student confidence 
and straighten out the misunder
standing, Mather emphasized that 
the school does and will continue to 
expect all students to treat each 
other with respect and professional
ism, and try to learn from each 
others differences.
The three primary objectives for 
the program were to gain access to 
outstanding students in CIT, build 
relationships between GSIA and 
other University departments and to 
link business and technology as they 
are increasingly so in the real world.
Students who apply to the pro
gram must complete internships 
after their sophomore and junior 
years to gain admittance. 
Additionally, a third internship will 
be required after their first year in 
the integrated program.
With applications due at the end 
of the month, it is as yet unknown 
how many CIT undergraduates will 
apply to the program.
However, all applications received 
will be mixed in with the main appli
cant pool and will receive no special 
treatment. Mather emphasized that 
there are not reserved spaces for CIT 
students, as some have speculated.
Though we originally announced 
that up to 20 would be admitted, I 
expect that number to be much 
smaller, said Mather.
for College Republicans who were 
booing from their windows and had 
hung signs and banners with their 
logo and the words Hippies, Go 
Home. As the activists moved past 
their hecklers, they began to chant in 
unison shame on you.
The protest drew activists from 
various walks of life, including many 
people who had never been to a 
protest rally before.
Im not a serial march-goer. This is 
the first cause that motivated me to 
come to something like this, said 
Gabriel Cohen, a first-year graduate 
student at the H. John Heinz III 
School of Public Policy and 
Management.
Kristina Alagar, also a Heinz stu
dent, thought the protests would con
sist predominantly of college stu
dents and other young activists.
The image of the activist has 
developed into a stereotype, and its 
important to notice today that if you 
look around, you will see all kinds of 
different people, she said.
Grannies for Peace, a group of 
elderly women wearing homemade 
knitted hats with flowers in them, 
defied the stereotype that all protes
tors are young and impulsive. Other 
groups included workers sent from 
Ben and Jerrys, wearing matching 
jackets with the companys logo, and 
Vietnam Veterans Against War. 
Several families brought young chil
dren and even pets, clothing them in

signs to wave.
ence between the MBA students and 
the CIT undergraduates. The aver
age age of GSIA students is currently 
28, but most of the CIT students 
admitted to the integrated program 
will be only 21.
But these varied ages have always 
been common within GSIA  each 
class in the MBA program already 
has students ranging in age from 22 
to 38.
First-year GSIA student Brett 
Hecker, like many of his peers, is 
concerned about the new CIT 
option.
He isnt comfortable with the 
admittance of undergraduates to the 
program, and fears they may have 
little to contribute.
Im not a big fan of someone who 
has no clue how things work in real
ity versus a book, said Hecker.
Hecker believes that students in 
the MBA program have a great deal 
to learn from one anothers time in 
the working world, and that these 
shared experiences and networking 
are two of the programs most 
important resources.
Though current graduate students 
have all but reached a consensus 
that the CIT option will be detrimen
tal to the quality of the MBA pro
gram, few have expressed it to the 
administration.
Of the nearly 500 students in 
GSIA, only a small number have 
come to Mather to voice their con
cerns.

500,000 protestors with signs, children, and pets descended upon the Mall in 
Washington, D.C. on Saturday for a protest the likes of which the city hasnt seen

Students file-sharing monitored by RIAA at over 2000 universities
than 2,300 colleges and universities calling 
on them to participate in regulating copyright 
infringement. It set forward a number of spe
cific guidelines for enforcing copyright law. 
These include informing students of their 
moral and ethical reponsibilities, specifying 
what is and what is not acceptable on the 
schools network, monitoring compliance, 
and imposing penalties against violators.
The letter was signed by a number of orga
nizations, including the Songwriters Guild of 
America and the MPAA.
I think it is a serious problem for both 
copyright holders and the colleges, said 
Jonathan Lamy, an RIAA representative.
To strengthen its position, the RIAA uses 
the issues of bandwidth consumption and pri
vacy as selling points to encourage University 
cooperation.
The University acts on such reports by 
investigating them itself. In some cases, 
Computing Services is unable to download 
materials from the alleged violators comput
er, in which case they terminate the investi
gation.
Many times, however, they are able to con
firm the reports and send an email to the stu
dent and disconnect their network access. 
The RIAA has also been know to send letters 
informing students that they have been 
caught distributing copyrighted materials 
and warning them of the consequences. 
According to Fowler, in some cases students 
have reported their fellow students as having 
certain illegal materials, but the University 
does not encourage student to student polic
ing efforts.
In October, the RIAA sent a letter to more
Trading movies and music becomes a 
bandwidth issue; it eats up Internet space and 
slows emails to a crawl, said Lamy. 
According to the RIAA letter to universities, 
one university discovered that 75 percent of 
its bandwidth was being consumed by people 
outside of the university. Lamy also said that 
there are security risks associated with using 
such file sharing programs, because they 
allow strangers access to a students comput
er. Students often expose themselves to this 
risk inadvertently, and many may not know 
pirating is illegal. Lerchey doesnt accept 
such claims of ignorance.
I do think that most students are aware 
that they shouldn't be doing it. Theres not a 
lot of moral high ground for students, said 
Lerchey. Policies against downloading copy
righted materials are part of the housing
agreements that students sign, and are more 
prominently displayed in other parts of 
University policy. According to policy, Users 
found to be distributing copyrighted materi
als will have their network connections 
revoked for not less than one full semester 
and may be subject to disciplinary action. 
Paul Fowler, however, is not so confident 
that many students are aware of this policy 
and its consequences.
The assessment was years ago that we 
should be informing students. We need to do 
a better job of informing students, said 
Fowler.
Nayoung Joe felt singled out by the 
Universitys enforcement of such policies 
Objectively, its good that theyre enforc
ing it, she said. Realistically, everyone 
downloads things.
RIAA, from page A1
legal obligation to investigate claims of copy
right violations, both CMU and the RIAA 
deny any formal collaboration in monitoring 
copyright violations.
Because transactions within the network 
are often password-protected, students 
downloading habits can only be monitored 
when they use file-sharing networks like 
Kazaa or Limewire.
Organizations are not able to access names 
or addresses of students, only the IP address
es, which are given to the University. 
Jonathon Lamy, an RIAA representative, 
would not disclose the details or the extent of 
its monitoring efforts.
We are obligated to at least investigate 
what they present to us, said Fowler.

Suspect identified in 
police impersonation
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
At 1:30 am on January 9, a man 
posing as a Carnegie Mellon police 
officer flagged down a car in 
Shadyside and asked for $20 and a 
ride to campus.
He claimed his car had broken 
down.
The impostor was dressed in civil
ian clothing and had no police identi
fication.
In an attempt to prove he was a 
police officer, he showed the man the 
butt of a gun that was tucked into his 
waistband.
When the man arrived the next day 
at the University police department 
looking to have his loan repaid, police 
informed him no such officer existed. 
The Pittsburgh police are currently 
running the investigation and have 
one suspect, a resident of Allegheny 
County, who is not in custody at this 
time.
Lieutenant Kevin Graham, assis
tant director of security for the 
University, said the suspect is not 
associated with the University in any 
way.
Since the crime occurred in 
Shadyside, it is outside the jurisdic
tion of University police. Still, said
Graham, they will continue to assist 
the Pittsburgh police as much as pos
sible.
Were concerned with the safety 
of people when someone identifies 
himself as a law enforcement officer, 
regardless of the agency they claim to 
represent, as it does pose a hazard to 
the people in the community, he 
said.
Graham said a police impostor 
poses another type of threat to soci
ety.
If the individual does something 
to [a civilian], it could result in a loss 
of faith of the community toward the 
police, he said.
According to Graham, there is an 
easy way for civilians to spot an 
impostor.
An individual who is a police offi
cer should always have on his person 
a badge, an identification card, and 
the identification card will contain a 
picture and the name of the police 
agency, Graham said.
A police officer will not show you 
a gun and say, I am a police officer. 
Police officers' dressed in civilian 
clothes do not brandish their 
weapons.
If the imposter is caught, the victim 
will testify in court, along with the 
Carnegie Mellon Campus Police 
involved in the case.University outreach under reconstruction

the rally. We hope this brings an ele
ment of surprise that will send a mes
sage.
The more than 55 groups that will 
attend the rally hope to make a strong 
statement not only about the war in 
Iraq but also about the government's 
actions at home  including college 
contracts with the US Department of 
Defense.
We are targeting a building on 5th 
and Bellefield which receives money 
from the Department Defense to 
build weapons, said Alexis Miller, a 
POG member and junior at the 
University of Pittsburgh.
We are not only fighting a war 
abroad in foreign countries but the
war is actually also going on in our 
own backyards.
The rally is a cooperative move
ment that will appeal to a wide range 
of age and interest groups.
The number and diversity of 
groups involved has already garnered 
media coverage. The rally has 
received attention from the
Pittsburgh . Post-Gazette, the 
Associated Press, the British 
Broadcasting Corporation, the
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and cov
erage is expected to continue.
CMU students should get out 
there and brave the cold to experi
ence something this politically 
charged, said Blinkwolt. We have to 
step outside of our little CMU world 
and see what's going on."
La Prima closed until violations can be resolved
include hot and cold holding, as well 
as insufficient sanitization.
Fahringer, who has worked in food 
services for 20 years, said that such 
violations are common throughout 
the food service industry.
To keep campus food establish
ments disease-free, supervisors are 
required to undergo a 3-day program 
called Serve-Safe every five years.
We will not expose the campus to 
problems, said Neal Binstock, assis
tant vice president for business plan
ning. If it is indeed the water issue, 
that is easily solvable.
La Prima has requisitioned a new 
sink to meet safety regulations.
Bill Moore, Parkhurst safety 
administrator, will be coming to the 
CMU campus this Tuesday to insure 
that La Prima gets up to code, said 
Fahringer. La Prima will likely open 
again next week.

According to Fahringer and La 
Prima co-owner Laura Vertullo, La 
Prima was issued a consumer alert 
solely because of the violation for 
obtaining water in an unsanitary 
manner.
The inspectors noted that water for 
coffee, etc. was obtained from the 
hose of the mop sink and that there 
was a dripping spouted container of 
toilet cleaner directly above sink 
where water for operations 
obtained.
In the 15 years La Prima has been 
open, we have not even had any vio
lations, said Vertullo.
This is very upsetting to me, said 
Fahringer. Any food services per
sons worst nightmare is a food-born 
illness.
A hand-written addendum to the 
report ordered that Water for per
mitted facility must be obtained in a 
sanitary manner from a sink 
appraised for food preparation. Do 
not obtain water from sink used for 
other purposes (i.e. mops, sinks, 
hand sinks, etc.).

OUTREACH, from page A1
------------------------
University itself, with a small central 
organization at its core. Faculty have 
always run their own outreach 
efforts, which have taken on an 
entrepreneurial spirit that Nair 
wants to preserve. Each semester, 
there are approximately a dozen out
reach courses available to students 
in many different disciplines and 
most come with school credit.
One of the few outreach courses 
required of students at Carnegie 
Mellon is Information Systems 
Applications (67-475).
In the course, information systems 
students create systems specifically 
for nonprofit organizations within 
the city. The organizations receive 
top-quality programming that they 
could not otherwise afford, and stu
dents gain real-world knowledge 
and experience in working with 
clients.
Some faculty had only begun to 
take advantage of the Center.
Information systems professor Larry 
Heimann has spent much of his sum
mers finding clients with projects 
that will fit the needs of the 
Information Systems Applications 
course. Because he was unaware of 
the Center for University Outreach, 
he didnt benefit from their knowl
edge base until last spring, when the 
Center provided him with two con
tacts.
Speech professor Natalie BakerShirers course Speech and 
Phonetics Instruction and Outreach 
allows Drama students to gain teach
ing experience in local parochial ele
mentary schools. Recently, the pro
grams tutoring has been supple
mented with software that BakerShirer has developed with the help 
of the Language Technologies 
Institute.
[Holy Rosary School] has asked 
us for this program, said BakerShirer, and it has been very success
ful.
Most of the children at Holy
Rosary School come from economically-disadvantaged parts of the city, 
and many of them speak thicklyaccented English. Baker-Shirer 
believes her program can help devel
op the good language skills neces
sary to find jobs and be successful in 
life.
Like many others, this course did 
not originate at the Center for 
University Outreach.
Susan Polansky, a CMU Spanish 
professor, coordinates tutoring in 
Spanish, French, and German at 
local elementary and high schools. 
Though she benefited from the infor
mation the Center provided, the 
course did not originate with 
University Outreach.
The Center for University 
Outreach did not cost a lot, but it was 
a luxury that the University could no 
longer afford, according to Nair.
The Center wasnt making a dif
ference increasingly, said Nair. 
Nair, like Flower, believes in the 
importance of outreach efforts by
the University. She feels outreach 
programs help students to under
stand responsibility and provide 
ways to fulfill their civic duties. In 
performing outreach efforts, stu
dents learn how to serve the commu
nity with their professional skills.
Without the Center, says Flower, 
tenured faculty are likely to be the 
only ones with enough time to 
research outreach projects. Most 
important to Flower is the continua
tion of the goals of the center, but 
she says outreach at Carnegie 
Mellon will not disappear altogether. 
In her opinion, outreach programs 
serve both to bring students of dif
ferent backgrounds together and to 
foster all students desire to give 
back to their adoptive community. 
She hopes that Carnegie Mellon will 
make outreach a visible public agen
da in the future.
With more resources, itd be nice 
to have a more organized center, 
said Nair. Outreach needs to be 
made more accessible.

Allegheny County Health Department posted a Consumer Alert after health vio
lations were discovered at La Prima Espresso in Wean Hall. Parkhurst officials

Bananas may soon 
become extinct
The head of the International 
Network for the Improvement of 
Banana and Plantain, Emile Frison, 
warned in New Scientist this week 
that bananas may disappear within 
the next ten years due to their lack of 
genetic diversity. The banana we eat, 
and the main variety grown through
out the world, is known as 
Cavendish. While wild bananas are 
inedible and contain stony seeds, 
Cavendish bananas are seedless and 
sterile, containing three sets of chro
mosomes instead of two. Since the 
bananas cant reproduce, they cant 
develop resistance to the fungal dis
eases and pests that attack banana 
plantations. Bananas are more than a 
popular fruit: they are a dietary sta
ple for 400 million people, said 
Frison. Genetic engineering may be 
able to save bananas by introducing a 
disease-resistant gene from a differ
ent species.

So, you want to delete a file. You 
delete it; empty your trash can; 
maybe even reformat your hard

Abhi Shelat, explain in the January 
17 issue of the journal IEEE Security

used hard drives and tried to recover 
files from them. Sixty-nine contained 
recoverable files, and 49 had signifi

Some animal tests 
banned in Europe
On January 15, the European 
Parliament voted to ban animal test
ing for cosmetics, with some loop
holes, by 2009. The cosmetics indus
try claims that the ban will stifle 
development of not only vanity cos
metics but also health-related prod
ucts, like sunscreen and toothpaste. 
Animal-rights activists are unhappy 
about the provision in the ban that 
will allow products which need to be 
tested for toxicity or effect on fertility 
to continue being tested on animals 
until 2013, and perhaps even longer 
if no alternative testing methods are 
found.

Genetic research 
reveals evolution
Insect wings seem complex, if tiny
 not the sort of thing nature would 
come up with more than once. So it 
came as a surprise to many scientists 
when, in the January 16 issue of 
Nature, researchers from Brigham 
Young University reported how their 
analysis of genetic relationships 
among stick insects showed that 
these insects had evolved wings, lost 
them, and re-evolved them again  
at least four separate times. While 
this finding is surprising, it is not 
unheard of in biology, where the 
basic idea of switching regulatory 
genes on and off is well-accepted.

Penguins exhibit 
strange behavior
Even penguins can succumb to 
peer pressure. Ordinarily at this time 
of year, the 46 penguins at the San 
Francisco Zoo would be staying in 
their burrows and grooming each 
other. But when six new penguins 
arrived on Christmas Eve and began 
to swim in circles in the zoos pool, 
soon all 52 penguins were doing it  
for hours each day, stopping only at 
dusk. When the pool was drained, for 
cleaning, the penguins just walked 
instead. They have continued in their 
tireless circles for nearly four weeks 
now. The swimmers timing and 
intensity seems to mimic their migra
tions for thousands of miles off the 
South American coast in the wild.

How things work: the secrets of CD & DVD
Optical discs are everywhere 
today, from CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, CDRWs, DVD-ROMs, DVD-Rs, and 
DVD-RAMs, to the odd Laserdisc 
or Sony MiniDisc. You probably 
use CDs and DVDs everyday and 
know that lasers are what sum
mon the likes of Eminem and 
Braveheart from the shiny sur
faces of your optical media collec
tion. The processes by which a 
laser or two can bring the excite
ment of Star Wars into your living 
room, or reproduce a $15 album 
on a 25-cent CD-R are fascinating 
marvels of modern technology, 
but are really quite simple in theo
ry.
Mass-produced CDs are made 
from a mold specific to a particu
lar album or software title. From 
Windows to Madonna, informa
tion on CDs is encoded by a series 
of miniscule indentations on the 
top surface which would appear 
to be bumps from th bottom, 
were they visible to the naked eye. 
This sequence of bumps spirals 
outward from the center of the 
disc and would be three and a half 
miles long if it were a straight 
line. A reflective metallic coating 
is applied to the dimpled surface, 
and then more plastic is added to 
make the top surface smooth. The 
bumps represent zeroes and the 
adjacent smooth surfaces ones  
off and on, no and yes, false and 
true. The information on CDs, like 
the information inside your com
puter, can be thought of as a 
series of flipped switches that rep
resent information.
To unlock the secrets encoded 
in the path of switches, a CD read
er shoots a laser beam at the bot
tom of the spinning disc. The laser 
pa&ses through the clear plastic 
material and reflects off the 
metallic coating behind the 
bumps and smooth points. The 
smooth surfaces reflect the laser 
light back to an optical sensor,
while the bumps scatter the light 
so that the sensor doesnt pick 
anything up. Whether or not the 
sensor sees anything determines 
whether a specific bit of data is 
passed on to the electronics as 
being a one or a zero.
CD readers are conceptually 
very simple, but the mechanisms 
that make this technology work 
reliably took years of research and 
development to perfect. Unlike a 
vinyl record, which spins at a 
given RPM all the time, a CD play
er has to slow itself down as the 
laser moves outward from the 
center of the disc so that the 
encoded data is read by the laser 
at a constant speed. Your parents 
might not know that the music at 
the outside of their records is of 
slightly higher quality than that at 
the center.
Dont have a factory to massproduce your own CDs? Maybe 
you dont want a million copies of 
some Yanni record anyway. Thats 
why CD-Rs that you can record at 
home are very different under the 
.surface than mass-produced discs 
you buy at the record store. 
Between the hard clear plastic 
lower layer and the reflective 
metallic surface, a blank CD-R has 
a layer of translucent dye made up 
of special chemicals that usually 
give it a green hue. The CD writer 
has an additional laser for writing 
data that is much more powerful 
than the read laser. It uses the 
write laser to heat the dye up, 
hence the slang CD burner. 
Instead of physical bumps, the 
regions of the CD that are meant 
to be read as zeroes become 
opaque from the heat. Where the 
dye is left translucent, the read 
laser of a CD reader can shine 
through the dye, bounce off the 
reflective metallic material, and 
come back through the dye to be 
seen as a one by the optical sen
sor.
The areas that have been 
burned by the write laser dont 
let any light pass to the reflective 
material, so the sensor detects the
same nothing (digital zero) that it 
does when the bump on a massproduced CD scatters the laser 
beam away from the sensor. 
Rewritable CDs (CD-RWs) differ 
in that instead of permanently 
changing the color and opacity of 
a dye, the write laser heats a 
translucent crystal material. 
When it cools, it is no longer in a 
crystal form and becomes opaque. 
The rewritability comes from a 
third laser, called the erase laser, 
which heats the material just 
enough that it is a translucent 
crystal again when it cools. The 
only drawback is that this materi
al isnt as clear in its translucent 
state as the dye in a regular CD-R 
is, so most CD-ROM readers wont 
be able to read the data on a CDRW disc.
DVDs exploit their surfaces 
more ambitiously than their CD 
cousins by allowing for multiple 
layers of data on both sides. But 
even the amount of data that can 
be stored on a single-layer, single
sided DVD is five and a half times 
greater than the capacity of a CD. 
There are a couple of reasons for 
this. The bumps that make up the 
data on a DVD are much smaller 
and closer together than those on 
a CD. Additionally, DVD movies 
are compressed with MPEG-2 
compression, similar to the tech
nology that makes MP3 music 
files much smaller than the raw 
data that populates an audio CD. 
Such compression allows you to 
fit upwards of 200 songs on the 
same CD, but you need a comput
er or specialized players to play 
them. Likewise, MPEG compres
sion allows a whole movie to fit on 
a single-sided, single-layer DVD, 
but that means that your DVD 
player needs to have complex 
computer circuitry inside it. 
Having to deal with compressed 
data is what makes DVD players 
more expensive than CD players.
The DVDs biggest advancement 
over the CD is that the read laser

Last year, gamers reveled in the 
police-attracting antics of Grand 
Theft Auto: Vice City, the retro kick 
of a Nintendo classic, Metroid 
Prime, the tactical espionage action 
of Splinter Cell  and we finally got 
to control more than nine units with 
the third installment of the 
Warcraft series. But what of 2003?
N INTEND  GAMECUBE
Nintendos Gamecube did not 
fare as well as some of its competi
tors last year, but the system did 
seem to grow a backbone with the 
expansion of the fighting and first 
person genres in games like Capcom 
vs. SNK 2 EO and the eagerly await
ed Metroid Prime. Unless you are 
feeling intrepid or are a particularly 
avid Sims fan, you may want to 
steer clear, of Nintendos take. The 
Sims was a wild success on the PC, 
becoming the best-selling game of 
all time for any system, but its intro
duction to the Playstation 2 evoked 
a lackluster response from console 
gamers. On the other hand, Tom 
Clancys Ghost Recon holds a lot of 
potential yet has a lot to live up to. 
As it walks in the footsteps of Rogue 
Spear and Rainbow Six, one can 
only hope that it will be worthy of 
the name.
Above all other games, Legend of 
Zelda: The Wind Waker has capti
vated Gamecube gamers around the 
world. The name itself carries a cer
tain amount of prestige, as its pre
decessors have raised the bar for the 
action/adventure genre and made it 
a household name. While some 
complain that the new graphics 
look somewhat childish and strange 
in comparison to Ocarina of Time 
and Majoras Mask, Zeldas mys
tique and rock-solid gameplay will 
undoubtedly drive buyers to the 
store in droves and make the game 
one of the Cubes real blockbusters. 
Other games to look for include 
Resident Evil 4, F-Zero GC, and 
Skies of Arcadia Legends.

Although the Xbox struggles in 
Japan, it thrives in the States with a 
plethora of new games this year. 
The appeal of the new Dead or Alive
Physicist plays with strings
to string theory. Greenes recent 
take on grand unification would 
banish the big point particle plas
tic models that littered your high 
school classroom and replace 
them with strings.
Strings are small  so unimag
inably tiny that they are orders of 
magnitude smaller than anything 
youve ever heard of today. 
Everything is made up of strings. 
They are the fundamental unit of 
the universe. This unique asser
tion leads to laws of space and 
time that flow naturally from the 
calculations used to describe the 
vibration of these strings.
Forget the guesswork of experi
mental physics. Greene contends 
that scientists can actually derive 
these equations from the math of 
string theory. According to 
Greene, some physicists find theo
ries with a natural simplicity 
much more attractive and believ
able. He describes the lukewarm 
attitude with which the physics 
community received early incar
nations of string theory.
Greene recounted the birth of 
string theory with the tale of two 
scientists, John Schwarz, of the 
California Institute of Technology, 
and Michael Green, then of Queen 
Mary College, who worked for 12 
years to build the theory and pub
lish their work. To let you know 
how revolutionary this break
through was, Greene said that 
particle physicists by the hun
dreds dropped their research pro
jects to launch a full-scale assault 
on what appeared to be the last 
theoretical battleground in the 
ancient quest to understand the 
deepest workings of the universe. 
The scientific community was 
shocked with the third major revi
sion of our definitions of the phys
ical world, which first began with 
Newton hundreds of years ago. 
The year 1984 ushered in what 
physicists call the first super
string revolution. These and the

String theory. The name draws 
inquiry from the average reader 
and inspiration from physicists. 
Whenever new territory is 
explored, the going can be diffi
cult. You can understand just how 
difficult if you know that when 
scientists cannot surmount diffi
cult calculations, they work out 
approximate solutions to the 
equations they have. For string 
theory, renowned physicists 
found the mathematics so over
powering that they only have 
approximate solutions to approxi
mate equations.
Brian Greene gives us The 
Elegant Universe, one very quali
fied scientists glimpse into the 
grand design of the cosmos. 
Greene is a leading theorist in the 
field of modern physics  specifi
cally, in the area of string theory, 
or M-theory. Despite being about 
a highly technical area, The 
Elegant Universe manages to deliv
er the bleeding edge of physical 
theory in language that any high 
school graduate can understand.
Scientists have long sought a 
Theory of Everything, and the

installment, Xtreme Beach 
Volleyball, is relatively obvious, as 
the pixelated vixens bound and leap 
in the sand while wearing just 
enough clothing to avoid indecency 
charges. The new Panzer Dragoon 
will run along the lines of the very 
popular series from the old Sega 
Saturn that has created a sizable fan 
base throughout the years. The 
most anticipated game for the Xbox, 
and possibly the year, is Halo 2. The 
original turned into one of the best
selling and most acclaimed games 
of all time, so the potential for dis
appointment is a real possibility, yet 
every indication given by screen
shots, demos and info leaks points 
towards excellence. Other titles to
look for on the Xbox include Star 
Wars Galaxies, Enter the Matrix, 
and Ninja Gaiden (a warp back for 
old school Nintendo fans).
2003 seems to be shaping up as a 
pioneering year for the king of con
soles. Yes, many of the titles expect
ed are sequels, but one cannot 
argue with more of a good thing.
On the original Playstation, 
Tenchu was a force to be reckoned 
with, as gamers wheeled around 
ancient Japan as badass ninjas. 
Appropriately, the new installment,
Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, looks like 
its going to be a refreshing upgrade 
of its predecessor. Devil May Cry 
was a staple action/adventure game 
in the beginning years of the system 
and it looks as if part two will follow 
in its footsteps. Most Playstation 
owners will reserve 50 of their gam
ing dollars for Final Fantasy XI, the 
latest installment in the seemingly 
eternal series. Beyond a new plot 
and spicier graphics, FFXI incorpo
rates a persistent, interactive online 
world for the first time. While many 
fans of the series are apprehensive 
about its movement toward the 
online medium in addition to a 
monthly subscription fee, other 
devotees to the series stand firm
and eagerly anticipate the next 
game that will consume hours and 
hours of their precious study time. 
Other staples of the year will 
include Xenosaga, Everquest: 
Online Adventures, and Dark Cloud 
2.
Given the revitalization of PC 
gaming in 2002, 2003 should be an 
exciting year because a lot of

How Things Work: the secrets of CD burners

in the DVD reader can focus 
through the semi-reflective materi
al behind one layer of data and 
bounce its beam off additional lay
ers. You might think of a screen 
door  if you focus your eyes on it, 
you see the screen; if you focus 
beyond the screen, you can see 
through it. A double-sided, double
layer (two layers per side) DVD 
can hold 17 gigabytes of data, more 
than 22 times the capacity of a CD.
Both CDs and DVDs feature 
incredible durability. Contrary to 
what people mistakenly thought 
when CDs were introduced, they 
are among the most robust of stor
age media. It is believed that for 
archival purposes, information 
stored on CDs will last even longer
than information printed on acidfree archival paper. CDs are 
resilient to minor scratches and 
grimy fingers on the recording sur
face. Its even safe to run a CD 
through the dishwasher, because 
unlike vinyl records and magnetic 
media (floppy disks, hard disks, 
tapes) that have data encoded on 
their surfaces, the information on a 
CD is underneath a relatively thick 
layer of hard plastic and is physical 
in nature, rather than the fragile 
magnetic encoding on floppy disks 
and videocassettes.
CD-Rs are somewhat less durable 
than mass-produced CDs because 
their information is actually encod
ed optically, by changing the 
translucency of dye, as opposed to 
molding the material to include 
bumps. As a result, sunlight and
excessive use can break down the 
delicate spiral of information on 
these discs. Aqd if theres one CD 
that you shouldnt touch or run 
through the dishwasher, its the 
blank CD-R. While grease and 
minor scratch* s wont affect the

sequels to very popular series are 
slated for release. Master of Orion 3 
is among one of the most-awaited 
games, alongside Sim City 4. The 
recent release of Sim City 4 is the 
latest addition to a classic series. 
Sim City 4 will bring the two popu

closer together by allowing gamers 
to watch the individual citizens of 
the Sims in their simulated cities. 
This creates the unique opportuni

the first-person shooter genre, pre
views of Unreal 2 have drawn 
beads of drool from the mouths of 
first-person shooter fans. Unreal 2
looks to have amazing graphics 
that will leave gamers wondering 
how much better graphics can get. 
For real-time strategists, the 
Command and Conquer series that 
was once considered the pinnacle 
of the genre has recently lost some

Letters to the Editor
Forum
THE TARTAN30 January 2003
CMU should seek more 
socioeconomic diversity
classes.
The admissions process must be more 
accommodating to all underprivileged stu
dents.
Carnegie Mellon should invest more 
resources in recruiting students from poor
er backgrounds by targeting high schools in 
previously overlooked parts of the country, 
while showing them that coming to 
Carnegie Mellon is a realistic opportunity 
given the proper financial approach. In 
some cases students may not need to be 
convinced that they should attend  they 
only need to be informed that they can 
attend, through scholarships, grants, and 
various programs offered by the military.
To make itself even more accessible to 
low-income applicants, the University 
should also consider rallying its alumni 
behind the specific goal of soliciting dona
tions for a disadvantaged-student scholar
ship fund; analyzing the current distribu
tion of financial aid monies, and reallocat
ing those resources to accommodate poorer 
students; or even creating and popularizing 
a private, moderate-term loan program 
through which students pay back Carnegie 
Mellon after graduation.
Ultimately, given its emphasis on student 
diversity, Carnegie Mellon has to get cre
ative and produce an effective plan to intro
duce a real mixture of economic classes into 
the student body.
Even if the Supreme Court upholds the 
constitutionality of the University of 
Michigans (and many other universities) 
affirmative action practices, and colleges 
and universities avoid what The New York 
Times says would be an overhaul in admis
sions policies nationwide, Carnegie Mellon 
must strive for more.
The University is known for its academic 
rigor and intellectual leadership, but as an 
institution of higher education, it cannot 
merely provide the means to enlightened 
ideals.
It must practice them as well.
t.As the biggest affirmative action case in 
25 years approaches, everyone from legisla
tors to onlookers are struggling with the 
unwieldy vocabulary of the accompanying 
debate: quotas, racial discrimination, seg
regation, equal opportunity.
' But diversity is the key word in this dis
cussion, for surely affirmative action is not 
meant simply to give just AfricanAmericans, or just Hispanics, a better 
chance.
Affirmative action may encourage a 
racially diverse student body, but, as a racebased process, it can accomplish a multihued mosaic of faces on a brochure cover, 
and perhaps a relatively culturally diverse 
population.
But admissions procedures, as they are, 
deliver an incomplete diversity. Schools like 
Carnegie Mellon must pursue an angle on 
diversity that lies beyond ethnicity: socioe
conomic background.
Like many institutions, Carnegie Mellon 
favors affirmative action  President Jared 
Cohon inevitably calls attention to his 
diversity initiatives at any opportunity  
but fails in its mission for diversity because 
of deficient admissions criteria. The 
University has taken significant strides 
towards a racially diverse student body, but 
it cannot claim diversity in economic back
grounds.
According to a study conducted by the 
Journal of Blacks in Higher Education 
(JBHE), the percentage of students at 
Carnegie Mellon who receive Pell Grants in 
2000-2001 was less than stellar.
'The study, which covered the nations top 
colleges and universities, found that about 
10. percent of Carnegie Mellon students 
receive Pell Grants, which are only avail
able to students whose total family income 
is'below $35,000 annually.
The University ranked 14th out of 26th 
on the list, which the JBHE says illustrates 
that the nations highest-ranked universi
ties still enroll mostly the middle and upper

You cut yourself off only if you so choose to. If you do not 
attempt to understand us, how can we take seriously your criticism 
that we are exclusive, or are at some fault? We cannot. I encourage 
you to come to our events.
Dont hesitate to ask questions. Involve yourself, because we do 
want you to be a part of it all. Why should Asian Greek organiza
tions have to feel unwelcome?
Sorority promotes diversity
Dear Anonymous:
Before I start you should know that we have some common 
ground: we both want to see more understanding between differ
ent ethnic groups on campus, namely between the Asian and white 
community.
But I was shocked to see blatant false statements in your letter 
used as truths and I strongly disagreed with other judgments that 
you made, as a member of a Greek organization, and more deeply, 
as an Asian student.
First of all, you deemed that the organizations Kappa Phi 
Lambda, Lambda Phi Epsilon, and Pi Delta Psi lack ethnic diversi
ty and are Asian-exclusive------that we dont do much more than
claim to promote cultural understanding and diversity. Have you 
actually looked into any of these organizations?
The fact is, there are sisters of many different ethnicities in KPL 
including Indian, Vietnamese, Latino, Turkish, and Malaysian. 
Lambda Phi Epsilon and Pi Delta Psi have brothers of AfricanAmerican, Filipino, Italian, and Irish decent, just to name a few. 
Perhaps you failed to read that the KPL organization here is the 
thirteenth chapter of the sorority, not the first?
Rush, one of the many reaching-out aspects of Greek organi
zations, is open to everyone. LFE stresses that it is an AsianAmerican interest fraternity, which means that students of all eth
nicities who are interested in our goals are encouraged to join.
The cultural events that we Asian Greeks hold are opportunities 
for people in the community to learn about other cultures, and to 
become better acquainted with the brothers or sisters of that par
ticular organization.
We have provided in the past and will continue to provide the 
chance for people to experience something different its up to 
you to come and enjoy it with us.

Police tactics irresponsible 
at Sigma Nu, says firefighter
Editor,
The use of a fire alarm as a ruse to evacuate a building for a 
police investigation, as Campus Police have admitted to doing, is 
more serious than an inconvenience, as the police have 
described it. It is a threat to public safety, and as a firefighter, I 
consider the actions of the police to be appalling and irresponsi
ble.
Fire alarm systems are designed to alert people to an imminent 
threat to personal safety such as a fire or other hazardous situa
tion. When you use fire alarm systems for other activities, such as 
police investigations, you undermine confidence in the system.
When the alarm goes off, building occupants will wonder 
whether it is a fire or a police action. This should not be permitted 
to occur nor to be considered an acceptable tactic in police investi
gations.
Fraternities rush ought to 
reflect their stated values
ships, states the Greek Life section of the 
Student Life Office web page.
The large majority of campus fraternities 
web pages - and their national counter
parts - also proclaim such noble goals as 
volunteerism, honor, and personal excel
lence.
When asked about their groups achieve
ments, many of our campus fraternities 
proudly point to their annual community 
outreach projects, including Greek Sing 
and family-friendly booths at Carnival each 
spring.
So why, when it comes time for rush 
events, do these service oriented fraterni
ties depend on sexy photographs and 
promises of girls and parties to attract new 
members?
The posters do not mention volunteer 
opportunities or other activities relevant to 
groups who have philanthropy as a primary 
tenet.
Perhaps fraternities do not have enough 
faith that CMU students will be interested 
in groups based around community service. 
Or maybe fraternities real intentions are 
not quite as righteous as they would have us 
believe.
There is nothing wrong if fraternities do 
want to focus on the social rather than the 
charitable. But if that is the case, they must 
update their mission statements and keep 
their creeds consistent with their recruit
ment techniques and overall actions.
Hooters or the homeless? In either case, 
fraternities need to cut the hypocrisy, 
reevaluate their goals, and truthfully adver
tise them.
With the start of the spring semester 
comes the semi-annual barrage of CMU fra
ternity posters advertising various rush 
events.
Flashy print jobs and long listings of 
social events vie for the attention of stu
dents and seem to leave little room for 
interpretation about the purpose of most 
fraternities at Carnegie Mellon.
Sigma Nus glossy rush poster announces 
a trip to Hooters and a hot wings night, 
complete with a busty, lingerie-clad woman 
holding a rubber chicken.
Kappa Sigma advertises strippers, 
while Theta Xis poster features a sultry 
woman in a bathing suit and also lists a trip 
to Hooters.
Pi Kappa Alpha appears to have put the 
greatest effort into attracting sexually frus
trated CMU males by presenting a large, 
colored photo of a buxom, bikini-wearing 
blond standing next to a list of rush events 
including ... a trip to Hooters.
Judging from the rush posters, fraterni
ties serve an important role at Carnegie 
Mellon by providing male students with 
beer, girls, and innumerable field trips to 
Hooters.
If you want to get drunk or laid you know 
exactly where to go.
And its all in good fuh, right?
Ironically, it is the stated mission of many 
campus fraternities to function as service - 
not social - organizations.
Carnegie Mellon Greek organizations 
are dedicated to academic achievement, 
service to the community, leadership devel
opment, as well as the cultivation of friendRIAA misses beat in attack on music piracy
The Recording Industry Association of 
America (RIAA) wants to hack into person
al computers and delete music files, and to 
destroy online file sharing services like 
Kazaa and Morpheus. In their attacks on 
everyday citizens, the RIAA has mistakenly 
tried to solve the piracy problem by being 
destructive rather than creating solutions.
Over the past several years, the RIAA has 
waged war on online file sharing of music, 
taking the fight to Congress, law enforce
ment, universities, and consumers person
al computers.
The RIAA has cried out against the rapid 
advancements in Internet technology that 
have allowed people to download music 
files from anywhere, without the industrys 
approval. Yet the organization has provid
ed no solutions to the fundamental prob
lem  people want to get their music 
online.
The organizations business model is 
naive and obsolete. They have failed to join 
the burgeoning Internet marketplace that 
has grown over the past few years. As a 
result, consumers have filled the gap by 
making their own file sharing software 
Now the RIAA thinks it can destroy legiti
mate computer software while at not pro
viding any alternative.
The RIAAs business model is based 
entirely on the distribution of CDs through 
physical stores  they have provided no 
way for current songs to be obtained 
online. There is also no means for a con
sumer to buy a single song, since singles 
CDs have never succeeded due to their high 
prices.
Often people will be interested in only 
one or two songs from an album. In an age 
when we can instantly handle banking 
transactions online, or order groceries for 
delivery to our doorstep, it is senseless to 
not allow consumers to also get music 
online.
Napster, the popular file sharing service, 
was shut down by the RIAA in July 2000. 
Since then, the RIAA has failed to make any 
progress towards releasing an industrysanctioned means of legally downloading 
music.
RIAA pushes its agenda in Congress by 
lining politicians pockets with money. 
Senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC) received over 
a quarter million dollars from the enter
tainment industry in the last election cycle

schemes often interfere with consumers 
ability to play the CD as they choose. The 
CDs often do not work in computer CD dri^ 
ves. So far, all of the CD copy protection 
methods developed have been defeated. 
Internet users will always find a way to share 
files, despite whatever restrictions media 
companies come up with in an attempt to lock 
content. Efforts to find ways of disguising 
music content to prevent copying are not only 
a waste of time, but infringe on consumers 
fair use rights. The courts have acknowledged 
that consumers have the right to transfer 
music to other locations (via a computer, or 
MP3 player) and to make a backup copy of a 
CD.
Broadband Internet connections are 
becoming commonplace and CD burners 
are sold with almost every new computer. 
The typical home computer user has every
thing they need to make their own CDs. 
There is no longer any real need to go to a 
store and buy a CD. The RIAA should pro
vide a fast and legal means of downloading 
songs and making CDs at home.
The RIAA might claim that helping peo
ple to download music would increase ille
gal distribution of MP3s. On the contrary, 
it might actually decrease it. If people start 
using the unsanctioned file sharing ser
vices less, the availability of songs on the 
shared networks will decrease, making it 
harder for people to get songs illegally.

recent years he has become notorious for 
supporting the entertainment industry in 
legislature that has threatened to trample 
consumer fair use rights.
The RIAA is trying to get a bill allowing 
them to hack into computers and check for 
pirated music files. In July of last year, 
Representative Howard Berman (D-CA), 
who has the entertainment industry as his 
largest campaign contributor, proposed a 
bill that would give copyright holders per
mission to disrupt peer-to-peer networks  
including by flooding a server with 
requests in a denial-of-service attack  
without facing the legal repercussions that 
would normally apply. This attempt to give 
the industry a get-out-of-jail-for-free card 
is indicative of the entertainment indus
trys ruthless and hostile attitude towards 
file sharing.
Many computer trade groups and 
Internet Service Providers are firmly 
opposed to Bermans bill and other tactics 
the RIAA has pursued. The RIAA has been 
nominated for Internet Villain of the year 
in the UK Internet Industry Awards for 
supporting right to hack proposals and 
other unworkable solutions to curb copy
right abuse.

America misunderstands issues, future generations suffer
Death penalty serves no purpose
One hundred sixty-seven former death row 
inmates woke up this morning knowing that 
the state of Illinois will never secure them to a 
gurney and end their lives by pumping 
procuronium bromide into their veins. State 
governor George Ryan, whose term ended 
January 13, provided them with this sense of 
liberty.
Ryan issued the unprecedented blanket 
commutation January 12, just two days before 
the end of the his term.
"Our capital system is haunted by the demon 
of error: error in determining guilt and error 
in determining who among the guilty deserves 
to die. Because of all these reasons, today I am 
commuting the sentences of all death row 
inmates," said Ryan in a speech at 
Northwestern University.
Charges of corruption within his office dur
ing his time as the Illinois secretary of state 
have threatened to engulf Ryan's legacy, and 
many claim that his motives for the commuta
tion are distorted. A conservative Republican, 
Ryan seems unlikely to make such a startling 
decision.
Until he entangled with the system's palpa
ble failings, Ryan advocated capital punish
ment. In 1977 as state legislator, he voted to 
reinstate capital punishment in Illinois after 
the Supreme Court lifted a moratorium on the 
practice.
However, during his four years as governor 
Ryan became fully exposed to the state's jus
tice system. He confronted the issue of the 
state's capital punishment on numerous occa
sions.
Ryan was shocked by the number of last 
minute exculpations taking place just days 
before scheduled executions. However, the 
death penalty hardly concerned the state leg
islature.
On numerous occasions it refused to pass or 
even consider the laws Ryan promoted in an 
effort to rationalize capital punishment in 
Illinois.
It is difficult to discern why the legislators 
have constantly refused to even the playing 
field and allow all those accused of capital 
crimes access to competent attorneys and DNA 
evidence.
In January of 2000, the exasperated 
Governor imposed a moratorium on execu
tions in Illinois, in response to the state's 
shameful record of convicting and sentencing 
innocent citizens to death row.
Ryan set up the Commission on Capital 
Punishment to examine the state's broken 
death penalty system. After a three-year study, 
the Commission recommended the implemen
tation of 85 reforms.
It concluded that the system was arbitrary 
and often ineptly operated. The study found 
that individuals convicted of homicides in
rural districts were five times as likely to be 
sentenced to death than their counterparts in 
the city of Chicago.
A majority of death row inmates were 
African-American and all-white juries had 
convicted 35 of them.
Since the reinstatement of capital punish
ment in Illinois, 12 individuals have been put 
to death while 17 have been exonerated. When 
a larger number of executions are overturned 
than carried out, it is more than just a flaw in 
the system.
During the last 20 years, 68 percent of the 
Illinois's death penalty convictions have been 
overturned through appeals.
Contemptible policing, even worse legal 
representation, and prosecutorial excesses 
have combined to cram death row with 
inmates either wrongfully convicted or sen
tenced to death despite the presence of miti
gating factors.
In 1985, after days of being beaten in a 
Chicago police station, Ronald Jones con
fessed to the murder and rape of a Chicago 
woman. With a dubious confession and 
absolutely no physical evidence, Jones was 
convicted and sentenced to death. DNA evi
dence finally cleared him a decade later. The 
state took away years of his life and all he has 
to show for it are memories of hell.
In today's society, most civilized nations 
consider the death penalty to be a cruel and 
inhumane form of punishment. It has been 
outlawed in 106 nations. However, in other 
countries, the death penalty continues to be 
commonly applied. China, the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, Iran, and the United States 
are the world's most prolific executioners.
The carrying out of a death sentence is the 
only irreversible form of punishment, it is the 
ultimate punishment and it may be inflicted 
on the innocent.
Between 1984 and 1997 the state of Texas 
increased its rate of executions. However, the 
state's murder rate remained constant. A 
deterrent the death penalty is not.
In the United States, 12 states and the 
District of Columbia have abolished the use of 
the death machine within their borders. But 
this has not stopped the remaining 37 states 
from executing 822 inmates over the last 25 
years. The use of capital punishment is not ret
ribution; it is revenge. It is state-sanctioned 
killing in an attempt to satisfy the bloodlust of 
society, and it lacks any redeeming social pur
pose.
The intent of our justice system is to protect 
society and rehabilitate those who break the 
laws. Imprisoning convicted felons ultimately 
protects society from them.
Nevertheless, the U.S. government insists 
upon going a step further by carrying out a 
death sentence. It does nothing more than 
give the government a power that it neither 
needs nor deserves.

A PERSONS
R2iormoas Ip d1rmo0u
In my life and work, Ive been fortunate enough to meet a wide 
selection of people, from production workers to people with 
PhDs to scrappy owners of startup companies. When I first meet 
someone in my job, I often try to figure out what his or her pri
orities are. If I can match my companys products or services to 
their priorities, my company does that 'much better.
I feel Ive come to be a fairly good judge of how people set their 
priorities. Sad to say, in our larger society, were setting the 
wrong priorities and pursuing them with a passion.
Take, for example, the recent case of Mike Heidig. Dressed in 
a Santa Claus outfit and singing karaoke, Heidig was arrested in 
Reston, Virginia, for public intoxication. Since he was drawing 
attention to himself, the local police took him outside where he 
failed a sobriety test. He was charged with public intoxica
tion...for drinking in a bar. Never mind the fact that Heidig had 
already made arrangements for transportation and lodging at a 
friends house. Heidig was part of an operation in Fairfax County 
that also caught several other people for public intoxication. The 
case shows just how out of order our priorities are.
Im no expert, but Ill bet donuts to dollars that there are 
unsolved murder cases in Fairfax County. Ill bet there are open 
rape and robbery cases. Ill even wager that theres a parent or 
two abusing their kids by either starving them, stranding them
while they go visit Internet boyfriends and girlfriends, or mis
treating them in some similar fashion.
Instead of pursuing such cases, we have police officers raiding 
drinking establishments, on the lookout for people who are 
intoxicated. (Imagine that. Intoxicated people in bars!) In the 
major scheme of things, does this make us a better society? 
Anyone whos been drinking with me knows I get very, very loud. 
I shudder to think that somebody could literally be getting away 
with murder while Officer Smith gives me a sobriety test because 
I was too vocal and drew attention to myself. Is this how we want 
to prioritize the use of our police force?
The inability to pick the right priorities,runs amok in the polit
ical spectrum: The Democrats are well on their way to losing the 
election in 2004 since their only platform right now appears to 
be a Bush is bad platform. Of course, one could also consider 
this a complete lack of any priorities whatsoever. While 
President Bush proposes an economic platform of questionable 
value, Democrats scramble to attack it without a coherent plan 
of their own. The best they'can do is rely on the tax cut for the 
rich rhetoric that doesnt play well with middle class voters 
who, you guessed it, own stock.
If the Democrats were smart, theyd capitalize on Bushs weak
nesses and prevent him from co-opting typical Democrat 
strongholds such as unions and health care issues. Of course, to 
do that, theyd have to start setting some high-level achievable

McDonalds unnatural flavorf r  1deceives Hindus, vegetarians
Fast food companies purchase frozen pota
toes for $0.30 per pound and sell them back 
to you as French fries for about $6 per pound, 
reheating them in oil to enhance flavor in 
between. At McDonalds, this oil includes 
mysterious natural flavor containing beef. 
This rather unnatural ingredient has infuriat
ed many Hindus and other vegetarians, 
prompting a controversial lawsuit the compa
ny cant seem to escape.
Until last decade, McDonalds used cook
ing oil for its fries that consisted of 93 percent 
beef tallow, which is similar to beef broth. 
This gave the fries more saturated beef fat per 
ounce than a hamburger, according to Eric 
Schlosser in Fast Food Nation. The company 
switched to a completely vegetable oil in 
1990 amid cholesterol criticism, but still felt 
the need to inject natural beef flavor into 
their potatoes. Not identifying beef flavor as 
an ingredient in both the oil and the fries, 
under the disguise of natural flavor, is part 
of a much larger loophole. The problems 
stemming from unnatural fries at McDonalds 
confront everybody, including those who 
never patronize the fast-food industry.
Natural flavor, like its incestuous cousin 
artificial flavor, is often produced by the fla
vor companies along the industrial corridor 
of the New Jersey Turnpike, far away from 
McDonalds kitchens, reports Schlosser. 
International Food and Fragrance (IFF), for 
example, uses the same science of manipulat
ing chemicals to put allegedly natural additives into French fries, all-natural juice 
drinks, organic soy drinks, furniture polish, 
and floor wax. Indeed this process confronts 
consumer products well beyond fast food 
restaurants, including many store-bought 
foods. Anything goes to blindly entice con
sumers, and its legal, too.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
does not require identification of the ingredi
ents in food additives. They are ambiguously 
supposed to be considered safe, but there is 
no confirmation process. According to 
Schlosser, Flavor compounds sometimes 
contain more ingredients than the foods 
being given their taste.
The barriers between natural and artificial 
additives are surprisingly insignificant. The 
FDA requires natural flavors to stem from 
fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices, meat, 
etc., giving consumers the illusion that they 
are healthy. However, the arbitrary distinc
tions between natural and artificial focus 
more on the process to make the flavor than 
its contents. Varied production of the same 
chemicals generates a different label; 
biotechnology including fermentation, 
enzyme reactions, and fungal and tissue cul
tures are all considered natural. Some nat
ural items are of course unhealthy, impure, 
or even deadly, but without any identifica
tion of them in ingredients, consumers 
remain ignorant. Whether or not flavor addi
tives are naturally or artificially derived, it 
requires an intense amount of doublethink to 
even try associating them with Mother 
Nature.

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 20, 2003
SAY WHAT?
By President Jared Cohon
(excerpt-from his state of diversity" address, Martin Luther King Day, 
January 20th, 2003)
Why Diversity? Why Affirmative Action?
Americas colleges and universities find themselves at a critical  and 
somewhat unnerving  turning point this Martin Luther King Day. The 
United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear during its current session 
two challenges to affirmative action in university admissions, both involving 
the University of Michigan. Since Michigan is a state school, the plaintiffs in 
this case have argued that the universitys affirmative action policies repre
sent illegal racial bias on the part of the state. Carnegie Mellon is, of course, 
a private institution. But like all private research universities around the 
country, we depend heavily on funding from the federal government, which 
is why we feel the ruling in this case could have a significant impact on what 
we do here as well.
In deciding to hear this case, the Supreme Court has essentially agreed to 
review its 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke; a 
case similar to the Michigan cases, in which an unsuccessful white applicant 
to medical school sued the university for discrimination. As most observers 
have recognized, the courts ruling in the Bakke case was hardly cut and 
dried. In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled that, while quotas were impermissi
ble, universities could legally take race into consideration during the admis
sions process.
Though the Bakke case has been used to justify affirmative action pro
grams, the courts decision did not provide unambiguous guidance. In effect, 
the why and how of affirmative action have remained unresolved for the past 
25 years. Some of the justices in the Bakke case maintained that affirmative 
action in admissions was justified as a means of correcting harmful discrim
ination. But Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. went further, arguing that the cre
ation of a diverse student body was also a compelling state interest, and 
could therefore justify the consideration of race during the admissions 
process. It is this interpretation  that affirmative action in admissions is 
important because the quality of the university and its programs depend, in 
part, on diversity- that the University of Michigan is defending. I have decid
ed that the stakes in the Michigan case are so high and diversity is so impor
tant to our university, that Carnegie Mellon will actively support the 
University of Michigan by filing a friend of the court brief in favor of their
position.
Twenty-five years after the Bakke decision, and almost 35 years since the 
death of Dr. King, why does the practice of affirmative action continue to roil 
our universities, our workplaces, and our country? Part of the controversy 
surrounding affirmative action stems, I think, from the fact that it means dif
ferent things in different contexts. And part of it has to do with the fact that 
when it is practiced, its not explained very well. With this in mind, Id like to 
tell you a little bit about what affirmative action means in the case of under
graduate admissions at Carnegie Mellon.
First, I need to talk about what it doesnt mean. It doesnt mean that we 
have quotas, or set-asides. Second, and more important, it doesnt mean that 
we are admitting students who are unqualified to be here, or who are inca
pable of doing the work, just because they are members of an underrepre
sented minority.
I cant stress this strongly enough: everyone who is admitted to Carnegie 
Mellon deserves to be here, both for academic reasons and for what he or she 
contributes outside of the classroom, and everyone is highly capable of 
excelling academically. If they werent, we wouldnt admit them. It wouldnt 
be fair to them, and it wouldnt be fair to the academic community as a 
whole.
Carnegie Mellon is in the privileged position of having more excellent stu
dents apply here each year than we can possibly admit. Over the past five 
years, Carnegie Mellon has attracted between 13,000 and 16,000 applicants 
annually. What this means, then, is that we have the luxury of admitting stu
dents who are both academically qualified and who contribute something 
else to the university community.
So each year, once our admissions committee has identified all the acade
mically talented students  the applicants it knows can do the work  it 
asks a second set of questions: What will this particular applicant contribute 
to the mix of students? How will he or she help make our student body the 
finest it can be? There are a lot of answers to these questions. Some of our 
applicants are excellent athletes. Some come from abroad. Some attended 
public schools, and others, private. Some have parents who went to this uni
versity; others have parents who never went to college. Some applicants are 
black, some are white, others Asian American, Hispanic, and Native 
American. Some are women, and some, men. There are many important 
attributes, all of which we want to consider in the admissions process.
So what do I have to say to you on a day devoted to celebrating one mans 
vision of a vibrant, multicultural Americaan America strengthened by rec
ognizing the diversity of its people? It is simply this: Affirmative action is not 
unfair. Affirmative action has not outlived its importance. Affirmative action 
does not mean lowering our standards, and it does not require sacrificing 
quality. Rather, affirmative action is essential to making Carnegie Mellon a 
diverse university, which is crucial to making it the best university that it can 
possibly be. And that, in my opinion, is something very much worth fighting 
for all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.
RIAA misses the beat
RIAA from page A10
Certainly media piracy is a signifi
cant problem and should be dealt 
with using the full extent of current 
copyright law. During this past holi
day season, the RIAA broke up many 
illegal CD duplication outfits and 
distribution points in Manhattan 
and Los Angeles. This is the type of 
action that should be taken to com
bat piracy. Attacking online file shar
ing networks has very little long
term benefit to the industry.
In its war on piracy, the RIAA has 
shut down or taken legal action 
against Napster, Aimster, Kazaa, 
Morpheus, Grokster, and others. The 
RIAA makes the mistake of assuming 
that all online file sharing is piracy. 
This is simply not true. File sharing 
can be used to exchange music and 
other types of media that are in the 
public domain. Independent artists 
also use online services to share 
their music and gain recognition.
The RIAA continuously complains 
that file sharing has cut into their 
sales. They said this even at the peak 
of the Internet boom, when their 
sales were at their highest. With 
recent measures that restrict con
sumer freedom to use music as 
desired, it is no surprise that the 
conglomerates sales are going 
down.
The RIAA is using file sharing as a 
scapegoat to blame for their nowdecreasing sales. They are using this 
excuse to get Congress to pass laws 
giving them unprecedented power to 
interfere with computer users activ
ities.
The RIAA is refusing to acknowl
edge other factors that could be con
tributing to its decrease in sales  
for example, the current state of the 
economy, excessively high CD 
prices, or increases in competing 
independent records.
The RIAA should create a webbased online service for sale df 
music. Songs should be offered fot 
download at a reasonable price  
say a dollar or so per song. Since 
online sales would not involve the 
production costs of physical CDs, 
albums could be sold at lower priced, 
which would help to attract music 
listeners who think present-day CD 
prices are too high.
The servers should be fast so that 
songs can be downloaded in a mat
ter of minutes over broadband con
nections. A wide range of popular 
artists should be available, with the 
service providing good search and 
categorization capabilities.
A service like this would provide 
convenience superior to that of the 
present file sharing programs. By 
providing these benefits, plus the 
legitimacy of legally downloading 
music, the RIAAs service would 
attract new customersthus help
ing to increase their sales.
The RIAA is faced with a choice: 
they can build a superior online file 
sharing service which would likely 
make them a lot of money, or they 
can continue trying to kill every new 
file sharing service that pops up, 
spending artists earnings on expen
sive lawsuits.

McDonalds mysteriously defies nature
MCDONALDS, from page All
strictly vegetarian diet investigated whether there were animal products in McDonalds fries natural flavor in 2001, 
the affirmative response prompted media coverage, riots in India, and a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the million 
Hindus and 15 million vegetarians in the US. The settlement finds McDonalds guilty for lying about their ingredients, 
and demands that they pay $6 million to vegetarian groups, along with $2 million to Hindu and/or Sikh organizations, 
$1 million to childrens nutrition and hunger programs, and $1 million to promote the understanding of Jewish kosher 
dietary laws.
Spurring recent protest, McDonalds has been allowed to choose which groups it will pay. Typical opponents of the 
company, such as PETA, Vegan Outreach, Farm Sanctuary, and Earth Save, have been ignored. The only true vegetar
ian groups receiving money are obscure and do not deserve so much while legitimate groups are neglected. According 
to VegSource Interactive, a pro-vegetarian website, some of the groups receiving payment are anti-vegetarian, such 
as universities conducting research against vegetarianism.
Three Muslim groups are being awarded money from the vegetarian organizations portion to promote humane 
slaughter, clearly at odds with vegetarianism.
The media backlash over the McDonalds lawsuit will probably lead to an impartial third-party selecting the recipi
ents of the payout. So long as natural and artificial flavors continue to go unidentified and unscrutinized, legal 
cases, and consumer dissatisfaction will continue. The Vegetarian Legal Action Network has petitioned the FDA to iden
tify all ingredients, but these efforts will not succeed as a merely vegetarian endeavor. Because of personal preferences 
and religious, ethical vegetarian, and health reasons, all consumers deserve to know the ingredients in their foods.

goals and rally everyone behind them. I dont see that happening anytime soon.
One of the most dangerous misplaced priorities is that of cost cutting. You see this a great deal in companies, par
ticularly in the manufacturing sector. Just about every company is talking about the overwhelming need to cut costs. 
They implement cost cutting programs, set up Six Sigma quality teams, and hack and slash at anything to reduce cost. 
Ive seen plant managers proposed wide scale elimination of entire processing steps without any idea as to the value 
those steps provide. Automotive companies are particularly good at this, mainly by pressing their suppliers to reduce 
their prices. After all, when youre incapable of reducing costs or running your own processes more efficiently, just 
take it out on your supplier.
The danger in this is that people, driven to cut any and all costs, may hack away vital organs while treating their 
afflictions. I know a man who was laid off from a large paint supplier because he had no direct sales responsibility 
(i.e., no accounts were directly his). The company who let him go made a drastic mistake; he knew the key decision 
makers for every single company in their market. He was the one who could help launch new product lines or entire 
markets.
While cutting costs is surely a good idea, I often wonder how much better off companies would be if they spent half 
as much time developing new products or adding value to their current products. Business history is replete with 
companies who took advantage of economic downturns to outmaneuver their competition, get closer to their cus
tomers, win new business, and emerge even stronger when the economy turned around.Hopefully, well see some of 
these people and organizations change their priorities. When you achieve some goals yet still fail miserably, thats a 
pretty good sign that you were headed in the wrong direction from the very beginning.

game.
; One area where the Tartans do 
have an advantage is backcourt 
efense. Granted, the Bears, who 
average over 80 points a game, have 
thrashed their conference rivals. 
Wash. U. has downed Chicago, Case 
Western, and Emory by an average of 
21 points.
; But in those games, Wash. U. com
mitted 45 turnovers, one more than 
their opponents combined. The 
Tartans meanwhile are averaging 
11.8 steals a game, led by senior 
point guard Michelle Sodini who has 
stolen the ball 49 times this season.
. While no Wash. U. player plays 
more than 22 minutes a game, three 
Tartan starters, Brady, Sodini, and
guard Carissa Sain, record about 30 
minutes a game. To keep their legs 
fresh, the Tartans will need more 
help from their bench.
Junior guard Marcia Valencia 
played admirably in an 86-81 loss to 
Brandeis on January 12, scoring 14 
points in 14 minutes. Her inspired 
play earned her 18 minutes against 
Westminster, the most minutes she 
played this season.
If CMU beats Wash. U., kudos to 
Seidl. But should a veteran CMU 
squad get blitzed by Wash. U., per
haps the school could start a scholar
ship for Soviet bloc and Yao Ming 
look-alike females. Even if that plan 
fails, at least the University could 
brag about its physical and political 
diversity. And theres definitely 
money in that.
Mens basketball smashes 
Washington and Jefferson
MEN, from page A16
Carnegie Mellon head coach Tony 
Wingen, If we took care of the 
rebounding problem and played a 
good game, eventually we would 
win.
Trading baskets and fouls to start 
the second half, the Tartans could 
not seem to regain their footing and 
reestablish the dominant play of the 
games beginning. The lead changed 
hands several times and 13 fouls had 
been committed en route to a 51-51 
tie with eight minutes gone in the 
half. Carnegie Mellon started its 
push for the lead going on a 17-5 
run, to take a 68-56 lead with just 
over six minutes to play in the game. 
Kaitz led the drive, scoring 11 of his 
team-high 24 points along the way.
It was a good game for me, and a 
good win for the team, but we can 
still play better, said the junior. I 
think our best basketball is still
ahead of us, as a team.
For Kaitz and the rest, this half, 
ultimately, was not sqaundered. The 
Presidents tried a late rally, with for
ward Nolan Larry hitting a threepoint shot to bring Washington and 
Jefferson within six points of the 
Tartans. It was not enough, however, 
with Carnegie Mellon holding on 
with some late free throws for an 
85-71 win.
By the end of the game the Tartans 
had evened the rebound count to 45 
all, shooting 48 percent from the 
field and 83 percent from the line.
The Tartans are poised to improve 
on last years 9-16 record and finish 
third behind conference powerhous
es Rochester and Washington 
University.
I think [Washington] and 
Rochester are the best in the country 
now, Wingen said. I cant see any 
reason why we cant be the best of 
the rest.

20 January 2003
Buccaneers 
smashed face 
and I called it
RuPos tuPPuSaw
Well football fans, it was quite a 
break for yours truly. After missing 
out on three out of four BCS games 
and all but one playoff game, I began 
championship Sunday in a very 
somber mood.
I was staring at what promised to 
be one of the toughest gridiron days 
Ive ever seen.
After my Niners took a sound 
thrashing at the hands of the now 
Super Bowl-bound Buccaneers last 
weekend, I had all but lost faith in my 
ability as a prognosticator.
But then something happened. 
Tampa Bay overcame the ineptitude 
theyve long displayed in the Vet, the 
blistering cold that plagues 
Pennsylvania, and the crazies on the 
700 Level who were salivating over 
the prospect of going to a Super Bowl, 
to defeat the heavily favored 
Philadelphia Eagles.
Unlike all those expert analysts 
who had been singing the Eagles 
praises all week, I called that game all 
the way. I was a proud minority 
among my circle of friends, bravely 
claiming the Bucs could pull out a vic
tory, and I was right. Throughout the 
week, people asked me why I chose 
Tampa, and I suppose I had several 
reasons.
My roommate and a few of his 
friends hail from the area and are avid 
Eagles supporters. I suppose one 
could make the argument that I, in an 
attempt to be as annoying as the flock 
of Philly fans who surrounded me, 
picked the Bucs for the odd chance 
that I could rub it in their faces if I was 
right.
This is a very sound argument, and 
while it is tough to be as annoying as a 
Philly fan, I plan on rubbing it in until 
they wish they had never met me.
But this wasnt my primary motiva
tion. As I wouldve written last week if 
we had published an issue, I truly 
believed the Bucs were a better team. 
Their defense was better both on and 
off paper, their offense was clicking 
from the week before, and they were 
the underdogs, which can be a great 
motivator.
The only advantage the Eagles had 
was the Vet, and if these playoffs have 
taught us nothing else, its that home 
field advantage doesnt guarantee a 
victory. Despite my initial chagrin 
about the Eagles dominating the first 
minute of the game, once things set
tled down Tampa Bay proved me right 
on all accounts.
They shut down McNabb and 
moved the ball very effectively 
against the vaunted Eagle defense. As 
the rest of the NFL world watched in 
shock, I sat there sporting a well-prac
ticed smug smile.
Brad Johnson is rapidly becoming a 
great quarterback who no doubt 
deserved a Pro Bowl appearance, and 
he finally proved that today. The Bucs
Brad Johnson is

great quarterback

deserved a Pro 
Bowl appearance, 
and he finally 
proved that today.
played to their potential, and, in 
doing so, validated my ability to pick 
football games.
But my day was just beginning; it 
ended with the Raiders neatly finish
ing off the Titans in the late game, 
making both of my Championship 
Sunday predictions correct. Now I 
have one week to argue and debate 
with my associates as to who will win 
the day in San Diego, and once again 
Im confident that the Bucs will not let 
me down.
Ive seen both teams at their best, 
and Tampa Bay is a better squad. They 
are solid enough on defense to shut 
down Gannon, and if Johnson can 
lead his team to victory over the 
Eagles D, he can handle a sub-par 
Oakland unit.
He will pick the secondary apart 
with the same set of underneath plays 
he ran today.
I dont underestimate Oakland  
they have earned their trip (although 
I still think Miami blew it), but Tampa 
Bay will prove themselves to be the 
better team. Ill be practicing my smile 
in the mirror all week in preparation 
for my Super Bowl party.
Any who think Im wrong are more 
than welcome. I look awfully good in 
smug.
Westminster sinks against 
Tartan swimming prowess
by Dam Pascocello
Sports Editor
It was more of the same for the 
Carnegie Mellon swim team last 
Saturday as they continued their 
winning ways.
The highlights were plentiful in 
this the second half of the season for 
head coach David Belowichs team, 
as his squad took on Westminster 
College.
At Wilmington, the mens team 
(6-0) triumphed 128-75 and the 
women prevailed 107-98 to improve 
to 5-1.
On the womens side, the meet 
came down to a final relay. The 
Tartans emerged victorious in what 
proved to be a dramatic finish when 
swimmers Allie Theuf, Audra 
Pompani, Mei-Lan Ho-Walker, and 
Julie Tibor propelled CMU to the 
win.
The mens team credited three 
strong efforts from two of its swim
mers as keys to its victory, as the 
Tartans kept alive a perfect record 
for the season.
Chris Pearson, a sophomore, 
broke two Westminster pool records
in the 1,000 yard freestyle and the 
200 yard butterfly.
Pool records are indices of the 
fastest times at individual competi
tion sites and are more specific, and 
thus more impressive, than school 
records. Pearsons teammate, junior 
Brian McCarthy, added his own time 
to pool records as he racked up a 
best time in the 200 yard breast
stroke.
The Westminster win came after 
another impressive outing against 
UAA opponent Washington & 
Jefferson on January 11.
The men won their contest 
134-79 while the womens side were 
victorious 136-83. In preparing for 
the upcoming University Athletic 
Association and NCAA matches, the 
CMU swim team got off to a great 
start as team Allie Theuf made the 
NCAA provisional cut in the butter
fly relay. Theuf also claimed swim
mer of the week honors from the 
NCAA for the week of January 12- 
18.
The Tartans next face Allegheny 
College on Saturday at 1 pm. This 
will be their last home meet in what 
has amounted to another banner 
year for CMU swimming.

CMU mens basketball smashes Washington and Jefferson
Women's basketball will face tough
company against Washington U.
Sophomore guard Mickey Goetz drives for two of his eight points on Wednesday in the Tartans' 85-71 victory against the Washington & Jefferson Presidents.
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
On November 22, in their season 
opener against Washington and 
Jefferson, the Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team fell into a two-point 
hole at halftime and climbed out on a 
big second half run to win 82-71.
The teams met again Wednesday 
in Skibo Gymnasium and the Tartans 
(7-5, 2-1) looked to keep from 
falling behind the 2-10 Presidents 
again. After dominating the majority 
of the first half, the Tartans held a 
commanding lead. And once again at 
halftime, they found themselves 
trailing.
The Tartans took the early lead led 
by junior forward Matthew Kaitz, 
who had his best game since return
ing from a sprained MCL earlier in 
the season, scoring 24 points and 
pulling down 10 rebounds.
"I played hard, got some good 
looks at the basket, and when you 
play hard sometimes the ball just 
goes in for you," said the forward.
The Presidents kept it close for the 
first three minutes, but complemen
tary play by point guards Eliot Goren 
and Mickey Goetz sent the Tartans 
on an 11-0 run and gave the Tartans 
their greatest lead of the half.
Carnegie Mellon was able to keep 
Washington and Jefferson at arms 
length for another five minutes. But 
late in the half, led by seven points 
each from forwards Michael Chicone 
and Marcellino Manilla, the 
Presidents staged a 22-12 run.
"We came out with a huge spark 
and we played really well the first ten 
minutes of the game, but then we 
really slacked off in our defense and 
rebounds," said the first-year Goetz. 
This lack of concentration sent the 
Tartans into the locker room smart
ing with a three-point deficit.
The biggest concern at halftime 
was that [Washington and Jefferson] 
had out-rebounded us, said

Womens basketball made big 
headlines in Sundays newspapers 
thanks again to the University of 
Connecticut. The Huskies won their 
55th consecutive game Saturday, 
giving the three-time national cham
pion Huskies the longest winning 
streak in the Division I sports histo
ry. But there is one team whose 
accolades soar beyond even those of 
UConn: the Washington University 
Bears.
The Wash. U. dynasty includes 
four consecutive Division III nation
al championships between 1998 and 
2001 and an 81-game winning 
streak that ended in January 2001. 
This season, Wash. U. is 13-0 and 
ranked first in the country, accord
ing to the voters of d3hoops.com. 
This Sunday at 3 pm they will host 
the Tartans, who have lost three out 
of their last four games, including a 
74-61 defeat to Westminster College 
(6-9), one of the local punching
bags CMU perennially pounds.
Its hard to demarcate this game 
as the crux of the Tartans 2002-03 
season, but without a signature vic
tory against a team like Wash. U., 
the NCAA tournament is nothing 
more than a figment for this veteran 
9-5 team. Going to the ECAC tourna
ment, the D-III equivalent of the 
NIT, is like making the Valentines 
Day Court when you had your eye on 
Prom Court.
Its tough to rile the home folks 
about Division III sports, in which 
winning is less important than it is in 
tee-ball. But victories are critical to 
fundraising. Consistent slamming by 
University Athletic Association 
opponents certainly does not help 
recruiting or boost prestige. More 
important to CMUs trustees, howev
er, is that losing makes it more diffi
cult to raise money for a much-needed athletic center. New gymnasiums 
were the project du jour on the cam
puses of Case Western, Emory, NYU, 
and Wash. U. during the high-flying 
1990s.

credit for at least keeping CMU semicompetitive in a conference com
prised of teams that are just plain 
bigger and stronger.
This game will tell a lot about 
whether the Tartans can even hope 
to compete with the Hulk-esque 
women of the UAA.
This years Wash. U. team is deep 
on talent and tall on stature. The 
Bears can rotate two entire teams on 
and off the floor. Ten players, six of 
whom are 5'11" or taller, average 
more than 10 minutes of playing 
time a game. Wash. U.s stronger and 
taller arsenal will try to dictate a 
physical brand of basketball more 
suited for the gridiron than the 
hardwood.
Containing the interior game fig
ures to be a hefty task for 6'2" senior 
center Erin Brady, who is one of only 
two Tartan players taller than 6'.

Dear Readers,
I dont really remember puberty. I cant recall any time when my body confused me 
more than usual, when I felt especially awkward or estranged. But I always paid 
attention in health class, and Ive been told that puberty is an exciting part of life. 
Textbooks say that its a valuable period of change that sets the stage for the glory of 
adulthood.
By my calculations  in magazine years  Pillbox is experiencing puberty. Pioneered 
last semester by (amazing) former editor Emma Rehm, Pillbox now finds itself evolv
ing into something new. Its still the same at heart  dedicated to Tartan arts and cul
ture  but its growing new sections, including a student artist spotlight and an 
upcoming crossword puzzle. It looks a little different than it did last year, it has more 
photos than it used to, and its voice is changing.
Even if Pillbox is a little confused, you dont need to be. This year, you can expect a 
broad coverage of arts and living, with an emphasis on student talent. Our brilliant 
posse of writers and photographers is ever growing. And most importantly, were 
devoted to writing about what interests you. Feel free to let us know what you like, 
what you dont like, and what you want.
Im excited to be a part of such a wonderful thing. So with just a few butterflies in my 
stomach, I cordially invite you to meet the new Pillbox.
Happy New Year, 
Lindsey Quinn Arroyo 
Pillbox Editor

CARNEGIE ALMANAC
JO YEARS AGO
The Thistle, Carnegie Mellons yearbook, shifted pub
lication to the summer so that the academic year 
could be included in each edition. Students had pre
viously received copies of Thistle before leaving cam
pus in the spring, but would, under the new schedule 
receive them upon return in the fall.
25 YEARS AGO
The renovation of the Webster Hall Hotel eliminated 
91 spaces from Housings already small supply. Bill 
Dillon, the director projected an increase in 200 
additional students in Housing Systems. Dillon said 
there was enough private housing in the area, but 
students did not want to live off campus.
ID YEARS AGO
On January 19, six student senators resigned from 
office. Many of the senators said they were not able 
to make the time commitment in the new semester, 
though some criticized the organization for not 
being worth the effort. CFA Senator Moneet Singh 
said that while some student organizations made an 
impact on campus life and provided a big return to its 
members, Student Senate did not create that return.
5 YEARS AGO
Shortly after news broke of former President 
Clintons affair with Monica Lewinsky, reporters 
flocked to Carnegie Mellon to contact Lewinskys 
brother Mike, a student and Phi Kappa Theta broth
er. Reporters approached students across campus for 
confirmation of Mike Lewinskys enrollment, and 
even recorded images through the windows of 
Lewinskys fraternity.
1 YEAR AGO
On January 15, 2002, members of the Black 
Graduate Student Association received an email that 
campus police described as ethnically intimidating. 
Computing Services and CMU Police were able to 
trace the emails to a public computer on campus and 
an anonymous Hotmail account, but did not find the 
identity of the sender.

Moscow girls:
Theyll make you sing and shout
Photo Courtesy of Universal Music
The name of the group is t.A.T.u., but it doesnt 
stand for anything. They love each other, but 
that doesnt necessarily mean anything. 
Theyve sold over a million records in Russia 
and they were the first Eastern Bloc group to 
sell over a million records in Europe, but my 
guess is that the relatively small community 
of techno-pop listeners in America wont be 
impressed by the affected voices of Lena 
Katina and Julia (Yulia) Volkova.
Though both girls are classically trained 
pianists, their musicianship seems to be 
missing in 200 Po Vstrechnoy (200 km/h in 
the Wrong Lane). The lyrics, supposedly doc
umenting their personal lives, are vacant 
and too heavily repetitive to listen to for any 
extended period of time. In other words, 
show me love, show me love, show me love, 
show me love, show me love til Im scream
ing for more will probably get skipped after 
about thirty seconds on any sane persons 
playlist.
And rightfully so. The song following it, 30 
Seconds, is the only track worth listening 
to. Unfortunately, even its Dido-like refrains 
wont repair the damage done by Not Gonna 
Get Us and the single released in America, 
All The Things She Said both consist of lit
tle more than their titles repeated ad nause
am, incompletely sealed with the annoying 
synthesized excuse for melody that only 
techno-pop can pass off as music, along with 
a dollop of incompatible industrial drum
ming for good measure. Goodness help you 
if you make it all the way through Clowns 
to Malchik Gay, or Gay Boy.
At least if you skip the first eight tracks, you 
can listen to Ya Shosla S Uma and Nas Ne
Dagoniat and (unless you speak Russian) 
remain blissfully untouched by the absence 
of content. But beware, my friends, of the 
extended version of Show Me Love. Its 
essentially an extra minute of Lena and 
Julia asking one another for gratification, 
in between bad musical interludes.
But the intimacy not-so-subtly implied by 
the songs on the album raises the question, 
are they singing to each other? In inter
views, Julia admits that they love each 
other very much, and Lena advises their 
fans, Be in love. Be yourself. We are. Yet 
at no time does the word lesbian roll off 
anyones tongue in reference to the two 
young temptresses. Its hard to figure out, 
between the photos in the liner notes, the 
entire content of the article in the sex
issue of Mixer magazine, and the forum at 
their website (www.tatugirls.com), what the 
story is, exactly.
Exploitation? Maybe. At the age of 17, in a 
country where life is more difficult and 
not polite, sex still sells. If it helps the girls 
to act and even live like lovers, or to host a 
bizarre TV game show in cotton briefs and 
camisoles, then it will be done. And in 
America, image is everything, despite what 
Sprite wants us to think. This image, of two 
strong and sexy foreign girls with unbridled 
passion  for each other  will sell. So, 
despite the lack of musical prowess, even 
200 km/h will make money.

Year of the blues:
Scott Ainslie ushers in 2003 with a twang
Youre sitting in a bar. The only source of 
light comes from the dimly lit halogen bulbs 
hanging overhead, and the sound of laugh
ter over alcoholic lips is airborne through 
the haze. A man takes the stage holding a 
LArrivee and approaches the microphone. 
He starts strumming down and pulling off 
on his guitar strings, his fingers picking 
notes with the dexterity of a casino black
jack dealer doling out cards. His sound and 
lyrics are a traditional medley of folk, blues, 
and jazz.
Scott Ainslie first became interested in the 
guitar in 1967 after he heard a guitarist 
named John Jackson play at Groveton High 
School in Virginia. He spent that whole 
summer playing on borrowed guitars.
[Jackson] was playing syncopated rag
time/Piedmont blues, said Ainslie. I 
walked in curious about folk music. I 
walked out a guitar player. My parents were 
delighted for all of fifteen minutes when I 
told them I wanted to play the guitar.
Ainslie graduated magna cum laude with an 
independent BA in Music Theory and 
Composition and as a member of Phi Beta 
Kappa from Washington & Lee University in 
1974. His music has been greatly influenced 
by artists such as Robert Johnson, Muddy 
Waters, Blind Blake, Reverend Gary Davis, 
Blind Boy Fuller, and John Jackson. His 
rhythmic and tonal roots are deeply embed
ded in African and African American music 
history. Ainslie believes that the history 
behind the music is as important than the
music itself.
Ainslie released his first book, Robert 
Johnson: At the Crossroads, in 1992, saying 
it served as an educational tool for youth
ful musicians. The book contains tran
scriptions of all of Johnsons blues record
ings. Currently the book is out of print, but 
Ainslie has hopes to get the book back into 
circulation in the near future.
The piece of the puzzle that I have my 
hand on doesnt come from books, said 
Ainslie. Most of what I learned [on gui
tar] came from hanging out with John 
Jackson and my friends.
Ainslie said that his playing style is much 
like his cooking. He doesnt follow the 
recipe, but instead adds his own personal 
flare to create a sound that is his own.
Many radio waves are dominated by the 
upbeat, drum driven rhythms of pop and 
rock music. Even so, Ainslie feels that the 
stamp of African-American music is all 
over American pop music. Nevertheless, 
he feels that the record companies are run
ning out of marketing ideas for the music, 
since most new songs share very common 
themes in tone and messages.
Record companies are going down, he 
said. Theyre not sure whether they are 
going to be around tomorrow. They are the 
slide rule of the 21st century. [People are 
becoming] interested in people who play 
songs with their hands, not just drumbeats 
in techno music. Give me someone who
Photo Courtesy of Scott Ainslie
plays a song with their hands. Music ought 
to be within reach of the people.
Ainslie has recently released his newest 
album You Better Lie Down which was influ
enced through African-American blues, 
work songs, gospel, and rhythm and blues. 
He is currently on tour and will make his 
appearance in Pittsburgh January 25 at 
Calliope in the Carnegie Lecture Hall.

Comic Release:
Artists tackle new media at the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery
The Regina Gouger Miller Gallery in the Purnell Center opened a 
new exhibit last Friday. Comic Release: Negotiating an Identity for a 
New Generation runs until March 21 and displays an eclectic vari
ety of expressions through cartoons, comics, and animated char
acters.
The opening ceremonies featured a lecture and slide show by Leila 
Pourtavaf and Lisbeth Pelsue of the Bookmobile Project. They dis
cussed the projects efforts to bring zines to new audiences, to 
strengthen and grow the existing network of artists in each city, 
and to support alternative media art work in North America.
Its a rewarding experience for us to see people have access to 
these works. Audiences are important to us, and so is reaching a 
diverse audience, said Pourtavaf.
The Bookmobile project is based in Montreal and Philadelphia, and has 
made stops in New York and Pittsburgh. They accept submissions of 
zines from artists all over the continent, of which nearly half are select
ed by a jury for inclusion in the tour. There are some challenges and 
barriers for the Bookmobile project, however. They have dealt with 
generating support including both funding and volunteers to run 
the show, generational differences in the audiences they 
encounter, apathetic audiences that simply dont care, and the 
worst: lack of an audience.

Ay Caramba!: Walter Robinsons Bart Simpson is a Comic Release show-stealer.
Some of our most challenging stops are also our most rewarding 
ones. Were willing to meet communities on their own terms, said 
Pelsue.
The artwork of Comic Release offers an eyeful of color, at times 
some blithe sense of humor, political statements, and social com
mentary. Some pieces honor cartoon greats, others create new 
characters aspiring to become greats. A sculpted piece, Bart 
Simpson by Walter Robinson, greets visitors as they enter the 
gallery floor.
Some of the artwork reveals an eccentric sense of humor. In his 
Real and Imagined, artist Phillip Knoll challenges the status of 
Superman as a recognized symbol of American power and justice; 
he appears in cape sans suit flying off to save the day in the buff. 
Paintings like that brought smiles to the lips of viewers as they 
joined in the artists fantasy.
One piece that portrays a very different message is Steelhead by 
Renee French. Using black pencil on paper, she conjured a lazy 
spring day where bees buzz, earthworms mate in a tangle, and a 
picnic spread waits out on a hill by a tree. Amidst this tranquility, 
images with nuances of humorously illustrated homo-eroticism 
are subtly magnified as French hints at a man having a sexual 
encounter with a small boy.
Paige Stover, a senior in SDS, describes Comic Release as an inter
esting commentary on the American pop-culture and its influence 
on art. Truly, the bizarre and multi-media images prove that art 
has not only survived in its traditional niche, but is also taking on 
new identities in other media. Rather than being overrun by tech
nology, the artists of Comic Release embrace new tools while still 
acknowledging their roots in pencil and paper.

Strip Club:
The low-down on Club M in the Strip District
Transportation-impaired students have 
often been frustrated trying to get to 
Metropol, a popular club and concert venue 
in the Strip District at 1600 Smallman 
Street. After recent negotiations to sell the 
club, reports that it was closing, and the 
relocation of some shows to other venues, 
patrons are even more befuddled.
Metropol owner/founder Robin Fernandez 
announced last month that he was selling 
the venue, pending a deal that seemed 
imminent. Henry and Tommy Wang, broth
ers and CMU grads, intended to purchase 
the club. Although the Pittsburgh TribuneReview reported that Henry Wang called the 
deal 99.999 percent certain to occur by 
the end of 2002, it never materialized.
Before the proposed deal collapsed, 
Metropol threw its alleged farewell dance 
party on New Years Eve. The Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette reported on December 10 that 
Metropol is closing its doors. Fernandez 
remains in control of the club, though, 
with normal business scheduled to resume 
soon; dancing starts again on January 31. 
Prominent acts like Papa Roach and Saliva 
have been booked to perform at Metropol 
in the coming months.
Because the club planned to shut down, 
scheduled concerts were shifted to other 
venues. While Metropols official web site 
contends that concerts featuring Nick 
Carter, cKy, and Toad The Wet Sprocket 
will occur at Metropol, other sources vary 
and still offer locations such as Club Laga 
and Rock Jungle. Attendees of concerts 
planned for Metropol are encouraged to 
confirm the show locations in advance.

Of Corsets Good:
Victorian brunch with a twist at The Ugly Duckling
Outside, rabid Steelers fans grill next to 
their $20 parking spots, but inside The Ugly 
Duckling, there are only lace table runners, 
tranquil classical music, and dish after china 
dish of neo-Victorian splendor.
I dined with a group of friends, and we all 
ordered the $12 Sunday brunch special: an 
entre, a side dish, a dessert, a hot drink, 
and a cold drink. We partook of several 
omelets, two varieties of baked French toast 
and several tantalizing cold salads.
There were no complaints about the French 
toast  in fact, the conversation suddenly 
ground to a halt when the entres arrived. 
The veggie-spiked omelet was small but 
yummy, flanked with bacon, and its side 
dish, the pruriently-named Golden Cabbage 
Toss, was large, sweet, and unlike any cab
bage Id ever had. A texturally-subdued cole
slaw included raisins, sunflower seeds, 
and just enough sweetness to belong to the 
brides side of the ephemeral cold salads 
family.
For dessert, there were homemade mini
cakes  small, but light and rich, some 
drizzled with white chocolate, some 
blonde and fragrant with fruit. One com
panion ordered the apple blossom, a mini 
apple pie hiding berries inside its flaky 
orb, replete with a twisted flourish on top 
that made it look like a Christmas orna
ment.
The food is dainty and delicate, and the 
atmosphere is lovely. Proprietors Lisa 
Ferguson and Danielle Baxter spent three 
months restoring what used to be Caf 
Victoria. Ferguson, who has been a choco
latier for ten years, brought The Ugly
Duckling Gourmet Edibles to Pittsburgh 
from New York in November 2001, doing 
catering, chocolates and cheesecakes.
When I lived in New York, I worked at 
Saks, in upper management, said 
Ferguson, We had to hold these fabulous 
events, but we had a budget. So Ferguson 
made chocolates and cheesecakes, which 
were such a hit with the hoi polloi that 
Saks started carrying them in its coffee bar.
It was a very affluent clientele, said 
Ferguson, Greenwich, Connecticut is only 
twenty minutes out of New York, and we 
had all the owners of the fine restaurants 
and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies shop
ping with us, she says. And the rest, said 
Ferguson, is history.

How to Get Fat
The best of holiday eating
Never trust a skinny cook.
If this old adage is true, then I spent my winter break rapidly 
approaching culinary reliability. For me, the holidays were a time 
of gastronomical extravagance, of non-stop gleeful eating. 
Anytime I considered returning to a normal diet, I was almost 
immediately distracted by a nearby plate of something sticky, sug
ary, usually chocolate. Even foods that I normally dont find 
appealing  like salty Christmas ham  suddenly seemed so appe
tizing when presented atop a red and green tablecloth, or on a 
paper plate with a snowman printed on it.
In order to gain five pounds in one month, youd have to eat just an 
extra 90 calories per day. Thats just about one piece of chocolate, 
two Oreo cookies, or a quarter cup of ice cream. I ate those calories 
with a smile on my face. And in my fit of overindulgence, I took the 
time to get creative, to experiment in the kitchen; so even if I came 
back to school with a little more insulation, the sheer bliss of my 
proper holiday feast was well worth it.
It started with Thanksgiving, the ultimate food holiday. Combining 
two of my gastronomical passions, I volunteered to make coffee 
and cream cheesecake for Thursdays dinner. Though it was the 
first proper cheesecake Id ever made, the results were surprising
ly perfect: smooth, creamy, with no cracks to be seen, and deli
cious. Though my family enthusiastically agreed that the dessert 
was irresistible, I apparently was more unable to resist than most, 
and I happily had more than 
my share of the pie.
My next felicitous discovery 
was a recipe for cream cheese 
cookies. Aware of my fond
ness for baking, a friend of 
mine asked if I could produce 
some kind of strawberry 
cheesecake cookies. These 
dont satisfy his request exact
ly, but with a dollop of straw
berry preserves in the center, 
they come awfully and deli
ciously close. Along with 
some chocolate mint balls 
and yogurt chocolate chip
cookies (another confection made at his request), they made a sim
ple and satisfying Christmas gift. The next time I make them, 
though, Ill have to make extra, because bite-sized cookies are the 
fastest disappearing sweet known to man.
New Years Day is my dads birthday. I firmly believe that the gift of 
food is timeless and perennially well received, so of course I made 
him a cake. Though Ill never understand it, he tends not to like the 
chocolate variety so much; instead I chose a pineapple upsidedown cake. I packed it with extra pineapples, and baked the whole 
thing in a skillet rather than a proper cake pan (easy clean-up this 
way). After a chorus of Happy Birthday, the light, airy cake was 
his to enjoy.
Strangely, despite the way I usually sniff at pre-packaged, E-Z-bake 
kinds of food, my favorite innovation of the season involved a box 
of Betty Crocker yellow cake mix. About a week or so into the New 
Year, I found myself craving more holiday treats. Lacking any spe
cific reason to bake something new, I pored over the kitchen 
shelves in search of raw materials. I found that if you eliminate the 
water called for on the back of the Betty Crocker box and replace it 
with something tastier, you can liven up an otherwise bland cake. 
In my case, I used chai tea instead of water and applesauce instead 
of oil (saving calories and maximizing flavor). Topped off with 
maple glaze (a slurry of maple syrup, confectionery sugar, and a 
tablespoon or so of milk to loosen it up), my personalized chai cake 
was a perfectly autumnal treat: spicy, warm, and comforting.
In the end, the scales were 
unforgiving, but I wear my 
new five pounds with an air of 
satisfaction. Every bite was 
worth it, and though I have 
made the formulaic resolution 
to eat healthier this year, I 
am armed with a fantastic new 
arsenal of recipes for when my 
sweet tooth strikes.

Carnegie Mellon has long capitalized on the handful of bona fide celebrities who once walked its halls; anybody 
whos received an official CMU envelope with Andy Warhols beatific mug knows its true. (Although, for the record,
Andy didnt quite graduate, nor did he quite like it here.) And we can tell stories about Ted Danson, who was known 
as Lurch back in his days at Donner House, and Holly Hunter, but it really isnt enough to hang our hats on.
If s fortunate, then, that Carnegie Mellon was actually home to quite a few famous types and cult figures at one time 
or another. Most of them were more NPR famous or Nick-at-Nite famous than Ted Tlimer famous, but we can prob
ably be thankful for that. Most of us watch the Anna Nicole show out of a morbid sense of fascination more than any
thing else, anyway.
Consider this a personal reference guide in case you have to talk to a Harvard undergrad who sits next to Natalie 
Portman in a seminar or a Yale-ite who happens to have slung espresso for Claire Danes personally. I would rather 
share an alma mater with Maria from Sesame Street or Agent 99 from Get Smart any day.
E.L. KONIGSBURG

the class of 1952.

Konigsburg was an excellent stu
dent. Following her graduate school
ing and her subsequent marriage, 
she taught at a private school for girls
and worked as a bookkeeper before turning to writing at age 37.
Konigsburg decided to make the career shift after realizing that she 
cared more about what was going on in my students heads than in 
the test tube. Her childrens predicaments became settings for her 
stories; Jennifer; Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, 
Elizabeth was based loosely on her daughters rich friendship with 
an outsider at a new school.
Konigsburgs contributions  aside from unduly-lengthy titles  
to childrens literature have earned her a constant place on reading 
lists and award compendiums. Her advice to prospective writers is 
simply: Finish.
GEORGE PEPPARD
On Peppards press bio, only the Actors Studio is listed under edu
cation, but like it or not, he studied here, too. Peppard is best 
known for his roles in films and television shows as diverse as 
Breakfast at Tiffany's and The A-Team, on which he aided Mister T 
and chomped on cigars.
A Detroit native, Peppard studied drama at Carnegie Tech after 
stints as a DJ, taxi driver, fencing teacher, and construction worker. 
His suavity and good looks kept him in the arms of beautiful 1960s 
actresses, including Audrey Hepburn, with whom he co-starred in 
Breakfast at Tiffanys in 1961. He followed up with roles in How the 
West Was Won and Carpetbaggers, but by the 70s his career had 
moved from the big screen to television. He starred in Banacek, 
Doctors Hospital, and The A-Team.
Peppards personal life was plagued by alcoholism and five short
lived marriages. Mine 
isnt a string of victories. 
Its no golden past. Im 
no George Peppard fan, 
he told New York Post 
columnist Cindy Adams 
late in his life. He had a 
lung tumor removed in 
1992 but died two years 
later.

BARBARA FELDON
Andy Warhol may seem at first to be the most mod-looking alum 
to come from Carnegie Tech, but dont forget Agent 99. The glam
orous spy who bid tigers to come hither in advertisements and 
who starred in the cult classic Get Smart was a Pittsburgh girl 
before she was a Revlon model, game show prizewinner, actress, 
gallery owner, and Ziegfield Follies girl.
Born Barbara Hall in Butler, Pennsylvania, Feldon graduated from 
Carnegie Tech in 1955 with a Fine Arts degree. Before her fame as 
secret agent Maxwell Smarts co-spy and wife, she was a contest
ant (and big winner) on The $64,000 Question. Later, she modeled 
Revlon products, but she was most beloved in her role as Agent 99. 
Before the late-90s girl power blitz, Feldon was an image of cun
ning and logic in a stylishly-coiffed, husky-voiced manifestation.
Feldon also starred in 
made-for-television 
movies like Lady Killer, 
now only valuable as 
kitsch. Like Herb Alpert 
records and compli
mentary airline bags,
Agent 99 merchandise 
shows up with startling 
frequency in thrift 
stores. Feldon exempli
fied the sleek mod look 
of the Mary Quant era, 
which is frequently 
relived by late-night Nick-at-Nite fiends.

A survey of famous alumni would be remiss if it covered only the 
actors of off-hours television. Many alumni have made tremendous 
advances in technology, but havent made the front-page news 
because their innovations are too field-specific to mean much to the 
world at large. However, James Goslings work with the Green 
Project developing the Java language is widespread enough to ring 
bells even with the most technologically illiterate among us.
Java, known as Oak while in development, is object-oriented 
and similar to C and C++, its predecessors. While it retains some 
of the characteristics and capabilities of previous languages, it 
eschews some of the confusing syntax and default elements of C 
and C+ + . Accordingly, its starting to replace Pascal and C + + as 
languages taught in introductory programming classes.
Currently a vice president and fellow at Sun Microsystems, James 
Gosling (who completed his PhD at Carnegie Mellon in 1983) con
tinues to work on the Real Time Specification for Java and other 
Java-related programs.
STEPHANIE LOUISE KWOLACK
As far as household name technology goes, Kevlar is right up there 
with Tang and Teflon. DuPont researcher Kwolack, who earned a BS 
in chemistry with the class of 1946, was a key member of the 
research team who developed the lightweight, flame resistant, and 
incredibly strong material.
Having already developed nylon, Dacron polyester, and Lycra spandex, DuPont was looking to develop a fiber for industrial use. 
Kwolack and the rest of the team found a way to spin aromatic 
polyamides into fibers by using solvents to break down their rigid 
structure. The solution created threads with amazing tensile 
strength, which have been used in bulletproof vests, cables, adhe
sives, sealants, ropes, hoses, brake pads, and a multitude of other

SONIA MANZANO
If you learned your alphabet from Sesame Street, you owe thanks 
to Sonia Manzano, better known as Maria Rodriguez of Childrens
Television Workshop 
(CTW) program
ming. Manzanos 
character has been 
central to the show 
since 1972, and she 
continues to do voice 
work for other CTW 
productions.
Manzano came to Carnegie Mellon from Brooklyn, where she was a 
student at the New York City High School of the Performing Arts. 
While a third-year student she performed in the debut of Godspell.
However, Manzanos most memorable work was with CTW. She was 
a primary writer as well as an actor, sharing in the seven Emmy 
awards given to the Sesame Street writing team. While child-orient
ed television usually brings to mind dopey dinosaurs and every 
anthropomorphized variation thereof, Sesame Street set the prevail
ing tone for edu-tainment, and plenty of Generation X reflects fond
ly on the Grouches, Muppets, and people of Sesame Street.

Stars of Redshift:
A CMU punk band waxes political and melodic
nn n
Jonathan Martofel/Photo Staff
Pete Borrebach defines redshift as an astronomical Doppler effect. 
When stars move away from Earth very quickly they appear to us as red.
The junior French horn major also plays guitar and sings in a band 
called Redshift. Fellow band member Brett Leber (drums) is a CMU 
sophomore in technical writing and human computer interaction, 
and Johannes Ma (guitar and vocals) is a senior in business and eco
nomics. Robyn Grimes (bass and vocals) is in her fifth quarter at the 
Art Institute of Pittsburgh majoring in Industrial Design.
Redshift is a new incarnation, born in September of 2002. Their sound 
is not mainstream; they make that completely clear. Theyre inspired 
by Fugazi, The Refused, City of Caterpillar, and Drive Like Jehu, and 
they say their influences are the best way to describe their sound.
Redshift builds their songs by writing music first and then lyrics. 
Borrebach and Ma write the majority of their lyrics; Ma writes from 
things in his head, while Borrebach functions on a more political level. 
The name Redshift gets its double entendre from his red politics.
Full Blooded American is their most overdy political song, but band 
members argue about whether Erode Away or Song #5 is their best. 
Erode Away defines their style, beginning with soft melodic guitar, then 
adding bass and drums for an aggressive sound. Song #5 is more imme
diately punk and fast-paced  reminiscent of System of a Down  but 
when presented with the possibility that Song #5 is in any way compa
rable to System of a Down, they threaten to cut the song all together.
it t
Redshift say that for now, theyre just playing to play. Theyre not 
worried about a record deal or getting paid. Music video fame might 
wait in their future, but if they ever get a record deal, they hope its 
with a small local label, to keep their product affordable.
You can catch Redshift in February at the Underground or in March 
at the People for Workers Rights benefit.

Simply Rejoicing:
CMLTs Rebecca Utt takes center stage at City Theatre
Rebecca Utt always knew that she wanted to be an actress. I knew 
it was going to be hard, but I knew I was going to be happy.
Rebecca made her first dramatic appearance at the age of eight in 
an opera. She was always involved in childrens theater and theater 
camps but she got her first big role at 13 or 14 as a fairy in A 
Midsummer Nights Dream. Now shes a senior drama major very 
excited and very scared about graduating. Shes also the youngest 
member of the City Theatres production of Sorrows and Rejoicings 
and anxious about her first professional role.
Rebecca couldnt be more pleased with the community that she has 
found in the drama department. With classes and rehearsals, she 
has little free time for anything else, but she is motivated by her sur
roundings. She says theres good drama everywhere, even in the 
classroom, and is always learning from those around her.
It is this strong community that fueled last years production of Pentecost 
at CMU, a production that she claims to be the best of her career.
Everyone was perfect: the direction, the design, the cast.
Rebecca made the transition from amateur to professional after 
being singled out in a City Theater audition last year. Shes been 
rehearsing for Sorrows and Rejoicings since December and is excited 
to be getting paid to do what she loves. At the same time, though, 
shes intimidated to be acting with local theatre celebrities.
After graduation, Rebecca plans to continue her stage career, 
because she feels comfortable there.
You can catch Rebecca Utt as Rebecca in Sorrows and Rejoicings 
starting February 16 at City Theatre in the South Side.

a day in t?
About face:
A close look at the life of an ROTC cadet
Every Wednesday, Erik Martin wears his uni
form to classes, and there are often snickers 
in the hallways. He isnt bothered in the 
slightest. Hes like any other student at 
Carnegie Mellon, almost. When Erik gradu
ates in May of 2005 with a degree in comput
er science (as well as minors in professional 
writing and engineering studies), he will not 
owe Carnegie Mellon a penny, because the 
Reserved Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is 
paying his tuition in full.
I wanted to get out of Virginia, Erik explains. 
So I thought about all the different ways I 
could pay for out of state tuition, and since Id 
always been interested in the military, this 
seemed like the way to Carnegie Mellon.
This is just one of the aspects of ROTC that 
other college students find surprising.
While very few students have ever been in 
or seen an ROTC class, they seem to have a 
low opinion of it, or at least a humorous one. 
They think that the military is this constrict
ing, tyrannical force, says Erik as he heads 
for his first ROTC class of the semester. And 
attending some of these classes is an eyeopening experience.
4:30 pm
Erik and the rest of the students cross the 
street to attend Commanders Call. There, the 
commander gives the students a preview of 
what is in store this semester, as well as what 
he expects from them. At the end, awards are 
given out. Erik is belatedly named 
Sophomore Cadet of the Spring 2002 
Semester, a tide that rewards his outstanding 
performance in the organization.
7 pm
Erik has gotten home and changed into his 
normal clothes. He isnt relaxing, though, 
because he's due at fencing practice, which 
he has attended since freshman year. As 
the team armorer, Erik repairs and assem
bles equipment.
9 pm
Tired, Erik catches some dinner to go at 
the O and heads home to relax with his 
friends before doing some homework. He 
gets to sleep luckily before midnight.
Thursday, 5 am
The most important thing to do as a mem
ber of the ROTC is concentrate on all of 
your actions at all times. And have a good 
memory.
The list of dress code violations, locker viola
tions, and conduct violations goes on and on.
7 am
Erik catches breakfast with his fellow 
cadets and heads back to campus. After 
changing into jeans and a t-shirt, he throws 
on a coat and embarks on a full day of class
es, including Research for Writers, 
Communication Revolutions and 
Technology, and Introduction to ECE, 
which run from 9 am to 4:30 pm without a 
single break.
If theres one thing ROTC has given Erik, it's 
been incredible motivation that carries 
over to all parts of his daily student life.
When an organization gives you so much, 
it really makes you want to do them good.
iaa iJAbdrkde wJoCCHEbJOE
Wednesday, 3 pm
As the students file in, boys with hair short and 
sideburns in check, girls with their hair in tight 
buns, they ask each other about their breaks and 
unload their coats and bags. Its like any other 
college class, until a loud voice yells for students 
to stand straight. Major Boyd is in the room now, 
but he is hardly the stem man you might expect. 
He makes funny jokes and pokes fun at a few 
students, loosening up the class. The class is 
about the history of the Air Force, and this ses
sion focuses onVietnam. To its credit, the class is 
very frank about the problems with Americas 
military involvement there.
Erik wakes up and hurriedly gets ready for 
the day. He pours Sweet and Low into the 
coffeemaker with the grinds before hop
ping in the shower. After quickly drinking 
the coffee straight out of the pot, he heads 
out the door to catch the 5:30 bus to the 
University of Pittsburgh.
6 am
Shaking off the bitter cold of early morning 
Pittsburgh, Erik sits down and tries to be 
alert while a cadet instructs the others in 
proper procedural organization, in prepa
ration for this summers field training.

Punch Drunk Love shines at the Harris Theater
I look at your face, and I want to smash it with a sledgehammer, at a family gathering, while his sisters mock his lack of success
^ whispers Adam Sandler to his sweetheart midway through the with women by chanting gay boy, gay boy. Always a nice guy,
film. A scene from the newest Sandler comedy, rife with toilet Barry stands there and takes the abuse. It is at exactly these
humor and violent gags? Guess again. This is Punch Drunk Love, the moments that Punch Drunk Love displays its quality. The film is at
latest offering from director Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, its most telling in its moments of silent awkwardness. Sandlers
Magnolia), and Adam Sandler, as tormented soul Barry Egans, face perfectly displays the pain of Barrys inability to communigives one of the best performances of his career. cate with those around him.
Punch Drunk Love is part of the 12 Best Films You (probably) 
Missed Last Year series, a film exhibition sponsored by the 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers. The series showcases 2002 films that,
* while critically-acclaimed, enjoyed only a brief run in theaters. 
Punch Drunk Love is a welcome addition to this quirky, eclectic mix 
of films.
Barry, a wholesale seller of novelty bathroom goods, lives the 
pitiable, isolated life of a manic depressive. In his cavernous ware
house office, he is mostly ignored, or at best, tolerated by his 
coworkers. Barry is ill at ease in all settings, and his tortured 
demeanor and sudden outbursts of rage serve only to alienate him 
even more from those around him.
Barry has another problem: his family. He is constantly harassed by 
his seven sisters, who ridicule his humdrum life and social inepti
tude. In one of the movies most chilling scenes, Barry stands alone
Bradford Yankiver/Photo Editor
I dont like myself sometimes, Barry whispers to his brother-inlaw. Please help me.
Barrys emotional deterioration fully reveals itself in one standout 
scene: a hilarious and utterly innocent call to a sex hotline back
fires when a phone-sex mogul (Philip Seymor Hoffman) tries to 
blackmail Barry into giving up his money. Though he suffers at 
the hand of the moguls thugs for most of the film, Barry finally 
fights back because he ultimately has someone to love.
Lena, played beautifully by Emily Watson, is Barrys Juliet and 
counterpart in many ways. Desperate for affection, she falls for 
Barry shortly after meeting him. Though insecure and awkward 
like our hero, Lena has the confidence to openly pursue what she 
wants, and her forwardness finally wins Barry over. Unlike in 
other movies, their sudden, unexpected chemistry is not 
explained. It just happens. Much to its credit, Punch Drunk Love 
does not attempt to dissect the intricacies of romance. Anderson 
understands that love, even in films, need not always be 
explained.
This movie ultimately reaffirms the power of life-changing, 
unfathomable relationships. Its eccentric approach to love is a 
refreshing alternative to the saccharine cuteness of mainstream 
romantic comedies.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
A new year, a new century, and a time for new beginnings. Yes, many were 
the folk of that time who predicted that 1900 was to 
be a year marking the start of great innovation, and 
Quackers and I were at the forefront of this research.
It's not very often that one can have the chance to 
work with a duck of such caliber as Quackers, so I 
considered myself very lucky indeed. Quackers had a few years previous
developed what he called a lektrik moater, and I worked hard with him to
create what we termed the lektrik horse. As early as late January of that year, 
we had designed schematics detailing the inner workings of the device, in 
which the moater turned when provided with many limes and lemons, thus 
propelling a rider forward at speeds rivaling a fast walker. But we ran into 
problems  the moater would not run very long before stopping, and despite 
my denials, Quackers blamed me for sucking the lektrik juices from the 
lemons. That is, until I contracted scurvy in April.

Escapism:
Comic Release exhibit fails the funny test
Its the 21st century and post-modernism still sucks. I hit up the Miller Gallery last Friday for the debut 
of Comic Release. The first thing I noticed was the shows second, more soul-baring tide: Negotiating 
Identity for a New Generation. This left me with a few questions, such as What generation? and How 
do you negotiate an identity? The second thing I saw was a whole bunch of sweet Star Wars toys. When 
I realized it was installation art, I decided this wasnt going to be my kind of comic release.
The show was packed with art students, guys from my comic shop, and 50-somethings who looked like 
they got lost on their way to the opera. Highlights from my notes read: less about talents of artists and 
more about the social statement of cartoon or comic aesthetic. Wastes a lot of time with failed critiques 
on the Disney cultural monopoly. Mind leeches.  So what does it all mean? The show may make bold 
statements about modern art, but it says next to nothing about contemporary comics.
Contention surrounds the definition of comics. In the broadest sense, comics are like a movie storyboard:^ 
still images placed sequentially. But people tend to recognize comics as words and pictures combined to 
tell a story. With all this said  despite where you draw your definition and even after tonights show  
the right stall in the mens room on the 3rd floor of CFA is still the best comic Ive read in a month.
Luckily you dont have to venture out too far to dig deeper into the subject of comics. Stop into Hunt 
Library or trek down to the Carnegie Library and check out Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud. 
Then go tackle Comic Release. Or if youre not the go-get-em type, just reread that Harold and the Other Guy strip you didnt get to last week.

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): You will be nabbed by the cam
pus police after your roommates catch you rifling through 
their mail and you are too embarrassed to reveal that you just 
forgot their names.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): When your professor accuses 
you of cheating, he is not doubting your morality, just your 
intelligence.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Masking your fear of social inter
action with the ambition to become a deep sea diver will seem 
like a less brilliant move when you are stranded by your team 
and forced to battle bioluminescent fishes with pointy teeth.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): The administration will not 
respond well to your assertion that according to the academ
ic calendar, Martin Luther King is only one-seventieth as 
important as Jesus.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Your desire to date 
an Olympic gymnast will disappear when you 
realize they are all permanently prepubescent.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Your idea of 
using old textbooks as kindling to save money on 
heating will fall through when your humanities 
student roommate says he can hear them crying 
out and goes on a hunger strike in protest.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): You will break off your 
engagement after your partner expresses a desire for children 
and you realize that procreation is not possible across species.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): A robot army wel
comes you with open arms. The scarring memory of their icy 
grip will motivate you to change your major to history and 
never build anything again.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Your hope that 
your roommate will stop putting ketchup on everything she eats 
if you mysteriously run out of it will be crushed when you real
ize that is why she moved to the Heinz capital of the world.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): You will soon 
bump into your one true love. Unfortunately the feeling will 
not be mutual.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Although you may 
think it would be cool to buy a laptop to match every outfit, 
doing so will not increase your popularity. Mac-haters just 
wont appreciate that kind of a statement.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20):
