University hosts conference to honor Rachel Carson
by Monalisa Ghose
Junior Staffwriter
On Saturday, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted a tribute to American ma
rine biologist Rachel Carson that 
honored Carson and educated the 
public about her agenda. The Ra
chel Carson Legacy Conference, 
Sustaining the Web of Life in 
Modern Society, was held in the 
University Center from 8 a.m. to 5 
p.m. The conference was the third 
in a series of four events celebrat
ing the centennial anniversary of
the birth of Rachel Carson, who is 
best known for writing the novel 
Silent Spring.
Edward 0. Wilson, a Harvard 
University professor, delivered 
the keynote address. He used 
Carsons work as a context for en
tering a larger discussion on the 
science of biodiversity.
A variety of experts held 
sessions in which they discussed 
current environmental issues 
such as global warming, the 
health of the oceans, and envi
ronmental leadership. This was 
followed by a group discussion
session titled Answering the 
Call to Action in which audience 
members composed an action 
agenda.
Patricia M. Demarco, execu
tive director of the Rachel Car
son Homestead Association, said 
she hoped the conference would 
motivate students to inspect their 
own ecological footprints and 
inspire them to take action.
I want them to ask themselves, 
What can we do individually? 
Demarco said.
She cited her own students as 
an example, who challenged her
to be a vegetarian  a challenge 
she met.
My students have the motiva
tion to be catalysts for change, 
she said.
Carnegie Mellon President 
Jared L. Cohon delivered the con
ferences opening remarks. He 
spoke about admiring Carson for 
having the courage to pioneer the 
global environmental movement.
Fifty years ago, people didnt 
want to hear about environmen
tal issues as they do today, Co
hon said. People tried to write 
her off as a hysterical woman
trying to scare people. She stood 
up to substantial abuse, and her 
message endured.
In 1999, Rachel Carson was 
recognized as one of the 20th 
centurys most important people 
by Time magazine.
When you say Rachel Car
son, people usually think about 
DDT [a common pesticide Car
son helped ban] and malaria. I 
want this conference to portray 
her as an inspiration to women, 
a scientist, Demarco said. She

Elections: 
how do we 
measure up?
See ELECTIONS, page A4
by Veronica Milliner
Staffwriter
Its no secret that Carnegie 
Mellons student government 
elections this year could have 
run more smoothly. In the past, 
Student Senate has suffered due 
to a lack of interest in govern
ment elections and overall gov
ernment participation, as well as 
technical difficulties, tampering 
with votes, and delay in approval 
of the final results. Now that 
Sean Weinstock and Adi Jain 
have been declared student body 
president and vice president, re
spectively, questions arise about 
improvements that can be made 
to prevent election problems 
from happening again.
The university already has a 
few ideas on how to improve the 
student government elections 
process.
Security of an electronic vot
ing platform will be one of the 
paramount factors to consider 
when deciding the direction 
of future elections processes 
at Carnegie Mellon, said Gina 
Casalegno, director of Student 
Activities and advisor to the 
student government executive 
branch. Casalegno also con
firmed that past problems that 
hampered the elections have 
been identified and fixed for fu
ture elections. Along with the 
examination of student govern
ment elections, there is a debate 
as to the overall effectiveness of 
Student Senate. Other universi
ties are striving to increase the 
presence and influence of their 
governments on campus.
Many student governments 
are reaching out to their peers 
via their websites. The Uni
versity of Pittsburghs Student 
Government Board encourages 
participation by featuring up-todate meeting times and recent 
student government decisions. 
Each Pitt board member has 
his or her own individual blog 
to post office hours and collect 
feedback from students.
American University, located 
in Washington, D.C., features 
blogs as well as an online maga
zine that provides detailed infor
mation about committee actions 
and an explanation of responsi
bilities for each government po
sition.
In contrast, the information on 
Carnegie Mellons Senate web
site is not regularly updated. Its 
most recent meeting announce
ments are for the fall of 2006, 
and the latest blog entry was 
made in January 2007. There is 
little, if any, information about 
the individual Student Senators.
The Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology is one university 
that is working to overcome a 
divided community and to in
crease participation in student 
government.
MITs student government 
is unique in large part because 
MITs culture is unique, said Ali 
Wynne, vice president of MITs 
Undergraduate Association 
(UA), MITs student government. 
Furthermore, the campus is 
quite decentralized insofar 
as there isnt much  indeed, 
theres a pronounced aversion 
to the notion  of a macrocom
munity. Its far better to think 
of the institute as comprising a 
mosaic of countless microcom
munities.
The UA is composed of a sys
tem of class councils with one 
council representing each class 
year. MIT also allows students 
to get involved by representing 
their living areas. Similar to Car
negie Mellon and many other

On Sept. 20, the Recording Industry 
Association of America (RIAA) sent 
another wave of pre-litigation settlement 
letters to Carnegie Mellon and 21 other 
universities across the country. Carnegie 
Mellon received 13 of the 403 letters 
distributed.
These letters, which are part of the 
campaign against illegal downloading 
that the RIAAbegan a fewyears ago, were 
sent on behalf of the record companies 
represented by the RIAA. T 
j|.Y, he RIAA represents some 90
percent of all legitimate sound
recordings produced and sold in the 
United States and aims to protect 
the ability of the recording industry to 
invest in new bands and new music, 
according to its website.
If found guilty, students are 
generally given an option for a 
pre-litigation settlement. It is 
also not uncommon for some 
cases to go to court,
said Mary Ann Blair,
director of Carnegie
Mellons 
Information 
Security Office. 
The litigation pro
cess is lengthy, but Carnegie 
Mellon limits its processes to 
that of an Internet Service Provider 
(ISP), said Blair. She explained that 
the university receives a letter with an 
Internet Protocol (IP) address of the 
alleged infringer and a claim that music 
was illegally accessed by that specific IP 
address.
After matching the IP address, the 
university forwards the letter to the 
student.
The university, in no case, discloses 
any information about the student to any 
external organization unless a subpoena 
has been issued, Blair said.
However, if the RIAA has issued 
a subpoena, the university conveys 
student details to the RIAA, said Lorrie 
Cranor, associate research professor in 
the School of Computer Science.
[Carnegie Mellon does not] actively 
police each student. But the Information 
Security Office (ISO) attempts to educate 
the students about the risk of copyright 
infringement and strongly deters any 
methods that may be used to procure 
copyrighted material illegally, Blair 
said.
[Harvard has] no legal obligation to 
deliver the RIAAs messages. It should 
do so only if it believes thats consonant 
with the universitys mission, wrote 
Harvard Law School professors Charles 
Nesson and John Palfrey on the

CMU goes ahead with IS major, research journal
New IS major on Qatar campus
Undergraduate students at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Qatar will now be 
able to earn a bachelor of science in 
information systems. Previously, the 
university only offered undergraduate 
degrees in computer science and busi
ness administration.
Students in the information systems 
(IS) program will develop technical, 
decision-making, and problem-solving 
skills applicable to both computing and 
business. Once students complete the 
program, they will be qualified to enter 
a variety of professions, from software 
engineering to entrepreneurship.
Qatar, with its growing economy and 
information technology sector, has in
creasing job prospects for IS majors, 
which is a factor in the programs grow
ing popularity.
Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar 
was the first university in Education
City, the city where the campus is lo
cated, to introduce the new major. 
Randy Weinberg, director of the infor
mation systems program on Carnegie 
Mellons Pittsburgh campus, expects 
that the program will establish the 
universitys reputation as a source of 
successful IS graduates ready to apply 
their skills to developing the national 
and regional economies.
The IS major is an obvious and 
welcome addition to the two exist
ing programs and it is the natural 
bridge between computer science and 
business administration, said Charles 
E. Thorpe, dean of Carnegie Mellon 
Qatar, in a Sept. 18 university press 
release.

Aron Ralstons courage inspires students
bf Brandon Sherman
Junior Staffwriter
Aron Ralston does not look any different 
when he is sitting down at a table. But when this 
egie Mellon alumnus stands up to shake 
ds, he uses his left  his right arm ends just 
the elbow.
Ralston graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 
7 with a degree in mechanical engineering 
French and a minor in music, 
tiring his time at Carnegie Mellon, he was 
RA in Hamerschlag House for two years, 
__ring which he became one of the founders 
the Hamerschlag Haunted Halloween House.
'Despite graduating a decade ago, Ralston still 
has the characteristics of a Carnegie Mellon stu
dent. For example, he said that his first reaction 
to Walking to the Sky was awe.
However, he noted that he saw how the 
icture could quickly become an object of 
ctile, proceeding to guess what sort of snow
ed spherical objects appear at the base of 
Walking to the Sky during the snow-covered 
winter months.
After graduation, Ralston went to work for 
the Intel Corporation. While living on the West 
Coast, Ralston fell in love with the outdoors. He 
began to hike extensively and climb mountains: 
specifically, several of Colorados fourteeners,
mountains over 14,000 feet tall. After five years 
working for Intel, Ralston decided to retire as a 
MechE and move to Aspen, Colorado.
There, he worked in a mountaineering supply 
store and lived in an apartment that was, in his 
words, worse than dorm housing.
It was then that Ralston developed the 
dream that would bring both highs and lows  
climbing all of Colorados fourteeners in the 
winter, alone.
In 2003, while hiking in Utah, an accident 
happened that changed Ralstons life forever. 
As he was traversing a boulder, it rolled, trap
ping his arm underneath. Ralston was trapped 
for five days.
Using the skills he acquired as a mechanical 
engineer, Ralston attempted various methods 
of escape. None were successful. Finally, dehy
drated, starving, and near death, Ralston had a 
realization; by breaking the bones in his arm, 
above the wrist, he would be able to cut through 
the flesh and free himself.
What CMU gave me prepared me for [life], 
Ralston said.
He now works as a guide outdoors, special
izing in leading at-risk youth and disabled 
veterans. Ralston motivates his clients by 
explaining to them how much he has accom
plished despite his physical handicap, and 
showing them how to do the same to reach 
their own goals.
Ralston visits companies as a motivational
speaker, doing what he calls storytelling.
My experience... affects the greater world,1 
he said, explaining his reason for speaking to 
the public.
The one benefit to his accident, he said, was 
that it accelerate [d] my life plans a bit.
Before the accident, Ralston said, he was in 
his 20s and fairly self-centered, concentrating 
on his goal of climbing the fourteeners and lack
ing a satisfying personal life. Afterward, things 
changed. Ralston felt the need to reach out to 
others who experience difficulties like his in 
their daily lives.
After the accident, Ralston completed his 
goal of summiting all of the fourteeners with 
the help of a specially designed prosthetic 
When hes not working outdoors, Ralston makes 
use of his mechanical engineering degree by 
helping to develop these ice-axe prosthetics as 
well as other designs for slightly less-extreme 
activities, an occupation which makes him very 
proud.
Ralston is not one to sit still for long. He re
cently went mountain climbing in Argentina 
He has also been steadily accomplishing his 
ongoing goal of visiting more countries than 
his age at 32, he has visited 40. In addition 
he is active in several wilderness-conservation 
groups, including one to protect Blue John Can 
yon, where he had his accident.
Without wilderness, my accident wouldnt 
have happened, Ralston said.

Nesson and Palfrey continued 
that Harvard should not be 
willing to let commercial 
interests intrude.
Blair and Cranor do not feel 
that Carnegie Mellon is ready to 
take similar action.
[To do what Harvard did] 
is the decision of the Office of 
General Counsel, said Blair. 
Furthermore, that would be an 
important institutional decision 
requiring a great amount of 
thought and discussion.
Cranor added that students 
behavior plays an equally large 
part in the process.
Students have to be more 
aware and realize that they are 
responsible for their actions.
RIAA cracks down on colleges
DOWNLOADS, fromAlLegal purchase of music is 
simply the easiest way to avoid 
getting in trouble, she said.
Cranor also said that the 
university can further curb 
illegal downloading by issuing 
institutional subscriptions using 
the analogy of journals in the 
library.
Blair said that the subscriptions 
were one of the many solutions 
being actively investigated by 
the university.
Students must realize that 
strategies such as this are not 
monetary but also technical 
burdens on the university, she 
said.
Students are split on the issue.
I dont think people should 
download music illegally. It costs 
a lot of money to make and many 
jobs are at stake, said Carlos 
Gasperi, a first-year computer 
science major.
It is just so much more 
convenient to download a 
number instead of a whole album 
or watch a movie at my leisure 
rather than go out somewhere. 
Maybe a new business model is 
needed, said Shazwan Azizan, 
a first-year economics major.
The university will continue to 
remind students of the dangers of 
illegal downloading.
October will be security 
awareness month, when we 
shall try to address issues such 
as Internet safety and, of course, 
copyright infringement, Blair 
said.
Cranor agreed that, given 
the actions of the RIAA, such 
measures will be beneficial to 
students.
The RIAA is showing no signs 
of letting up, and so all I can do 
is urge everyone to use caution, 
Cranor said.

explaining that he was running 
late from another meeting.
After the elections ordeal that 
lasted nearly six months, Wein

pointed last Monday.
We cracked the obligatory 
smile when we heard that GSA

appointment, said Weinstock. 
Then, we went straight to the

about our first meeting just hours 
later.
Although they will spend al

that theyd be able to accomplish

each other on almost every front. 
Beyond their similar collared

words, in sync.
They talked about the number

the term he and Jain assigned to 
the five main goals they hoped to 
achieve while in office.
Weinstock hopes to have even 
more encounters with the stu
dent body, including first-years, 
whom he hopes will feel free to 
bring him all their ideas.
I guess what Im really excited 
about is just talking to students 
and getting things done, Jain 
said.
But, they insisted, their ideal 
Carnegie Mellon is so much 
more than just the CMU 5. 
Although they plan to fully 
implement the CMU 5 and its 
accompanying initiatives, they 
hope to expand it much more.
Im not the champion of ev
eryones issues, Weinstock said.
Weinstock and Jain stressed 
the need to work with students, 
faculty, and staff to improve the 
university as much as possible.
They have started work on one 
of the five, Power to the People, 
by talking to the library about 
installing Microsoft Office on all 
cluster computers and adding 
additional power outlets in work 
areas.
They will also continue to work 
on the institutional memory ini
tiative aimed at increasing the 
use of the Tartan Wiki, a database 
for all student organizations. 
The two have already met with 
Karl Sjogren and Andrea Hamil
ton, former SBP and SBVP, who 
started the institutional memory 
initiative.
For Weinstock and Jain, the 
presidency is just a position which 
will make it easier for them to 
put their proposed changes into 
effect. One person alone can 
change things, the two insisted, 
but their positions now give them 
a great point from which to start.
The message is the same as 
its always been. Come to us and 
tell us whatever youre thinking 
about, Weinstock said.
Find us, e-mail us, harass us, 
whatever you have to do, Jain 
added.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 1, 2007
Conference brings
up green issues
CARSON, from A1
was aware of the relationship 
between people and the climate, 
people and the ocean long before 
the idea of global warming was 
seen as it is today.
Jennifer Schroeder, program 
officer and webmaster of Clean 
Air/Cool Planet, a non-profit 
organization which focuses on 
finding solutions to global warm
ing, spoke about the difficulties 
of looking at global warming and 
climate change in the context 
of the individual. She conceded 
that people cant participate in 
society without consuming, and 
that even when individuals make 
a commitment to using renew
able energy, recycling, buying 
local products, riding bikes, and 
other eco-friendly activities, the 
problem isnt solved.
Schroeder encouraged stu
dents to begin a dialogue on 
campus by asking questions like: 
Why doesnt everyone want to 
recycle?; Are they being lazy?; 
Why arent people getting the 
message?; How should we or
ganize this?; and What kinds
of containers should we buy?
Chaining yourself to a tree is 
no longer effective, said James 
Ayers, vice president of Oceana, 
an environmental organization 
devoted to protecting and restor
ing the worlds oceans.
Ayers urged students and 
adults to overcome avarice, con
sume less, and get involved. He 
spoke of the process involved 
in moving governments around 
the world toward change, a pro
cess which involves performing 
research, informing the public, 
joining alliances and partner
ships, and communicating with 
executive administrations.
Carnegie Mellon students have 
already begun this process.
Austin Redwood, president of 
the on-campus environmental 
organization Sustainable Earth, 
is currently working on a proj
ect to increase the amount of 
alternative energy purchased by 
Carnegie Mellon students from 
20 percent to 51 percent.
People here have heard things 
that have been said before, Red
wood said. Now Im ready to
turn that into action. The Rachel Carson Legacy Conference on Saturday brought students, faculty, and staff together to discuss environmental issues such as climate change.

ELECTIONS, from A1
schools, MIT also has subcommit
tees dedicated to particular areas 
of student life.
While Carnegie Mellons stu
dent government usually gathers 
in a regular room for meetings, 
MITs UA uses its meetings as an 
opportunity to connect with the 
campus community.
We regularly inform students 
of various ways in which they can 
become involved in the UA and en
courage them to run in elections, 
Wynne said. The UA has trav
eling meetings that are held in 
different locations on campus. We 
want to put a face on the UA and
show that were not only reaching 
out to a few constituencies.
However, student skepticism is 
the largest obstacle many student 
governments must overcome.
Students often voice concerns 
over student government hav
ing enough actual influence to be 
able to make a noticeable change 
on campus. Sara Minton, a senior 
at the University of Pittsburgh, 
said that she has never voted in a 
student election because it didnt 
seem like the candidates had 
enough power to make a differ
ence.
I dont know very much 
about student government, but I 
wouldnt think it would be very
effective because I feel like an 
agenda is already set, and I dont 
think SGB [Student Government 
Board] could do much to change 
that, she said.
However, Minton also admitted 
that there are many ways for her 
to become involved if she wished.
Wynne also tries to increase 
participation and trust in student 
government at MIT by connect
ing with students individually. 
If I meet someone who seems 
particularly passionate about stu
dent life issues, Ill oftentimes ask 
him or her to consider applying to 
serve on a given committee or run 
for an office, she said.
Although Casalegno expressed
that it was too soon to state any 
definite changes that will occur 
within Student Senate here, she 
does believe that Carnegie Mel
lons student government will 
overcome its past problems and 
continue to improve in the future.
Carnegie Mellons student gov
ernment has the potential to effect 
great change and influence on our 
campus, Casalegno said. Cur
rently, Senators, GSA representa
tives, and the executive branch 
give voice to the issues, ideas, and 
needs of students by meeting with 
various administrators and cam
pus collaborators and working to 
continually improve the student 
experience at Carnegie Mellon.

Researchers 
detect 
palladium
by Marium Chandna
Junior Staffwriter
A team of chemists at the 
University of Pittsburgh has dis
covered an effective and cost-efficient method of detecting pal
ladium and platinum deposits in 
a product, such as medicine.
This new technique uses a 
highly receptive fluorescent 
sensor to expose palladium and 
platinum vestiges in less than 60 
minutes.
The research was conducted 
by chemistry professor Kazunori 
Koide, post-doctoral fellow 
Fengling Song, and chemis
try graduate student Amanda 
Garner at the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Koide specializes in the or
ganic synthesis of natural prod
ucts, researching new synthetic 
methods, diversity-oriented syn
thesis, and organic fluorescent 
sensors, as stated on his faculty 
web page. The find was officially 
published online in the Journal 
of American Chemical Studies 
on Sept. 21.
Similarinchemicalproperties, 
palladium and platinum cater to 
a variety of uses, including the 
processing of pharmaceuticals, 
automobiles, and jewelry. They 
are also employed in the con
figuration of electrical devices 
such as sparkplugs. While usage 
of palladium and platinum is 
sought after, the extent of their 
presence is difficult to observe. 
Koides research focused on 
overcoming this setback.
As mentioned by the inventors 
in their published study titled 
A Highly Sensitive Fluorescent 
Sensor For Palladium Based On 
the Allylic Oxidative Insertion 
Mechanism, the fluorescent 
sensor method depends on a 
transparent fluorescein-based 
solution.
When this solution is brought 
to interact with even subtle 
quantities of palladium and/or

Scarab the robot
by Lowell Labaro
Junior Staffwriter
The Field Robotics Center at Carnegie 
Mellons Robotics Institute has developed a 
prototype moon rover, Scarab. The robot 
has the ability to perform the challenging 
task of lunar prospecting.
The ultimate goal of lunar prospecting is 
to discover, extract, and utilize resources in 
the soil of other planets.
David Wettergreen, leader of Scarabs 
software and autonomy development, said, 
This is a technology development program
thtrt is focusing on extracting hydrogen atw ' 
togen from lunar soil. '
NASA currently has no plans for a robotic 
mission to the moon. However, Scarab pro
vides developers and engineers a test bed 
for potential designs and ide^s in order to 
be better prepared for a lunar mission in the 
future.
Wettergreen said that Scarab mainly 
serves as early concept definition and tech
nology development.
NASA project manager John Caruso said, : 
Dark navigation and drilling were the ma
jor goals.
Northern Centre for Advanced Technol
op IjieTXNORQft') developed a drill for the 
robot.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press 
release, the drill is capable of obtain
ing meter-long geological core samples and 
features a novel rocker-arm suspension that 
enables the robot to plant its belly on the 
ground.
In constructing the robot, researchers had 
to make sure that the body of the rover was 
liglit but still capable of providing the re
quired downward force for surface drilling.

Carnegie Mellon introduces Gigapan device
by Eugene Kang
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon unveiled a 
new robotic camera system called 
the Gigapan last* Wednesday, 
and it is already changing the way 
people view the world through 
photographs.
Gigapan was developed during 
a two-year partnership between 
scientists from Carnegie Mellon
and NASAs Ames Research Cen
ter. Theres been very close col
laboration, said Laura Tomokiyo, 
project scientist of the Gigapan at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Its been wonderful to work 
with them. NASA Ames as an or
ganization has been extremely 
supportive of Gigapa'n and, during 
the projects time, has contributed 
a lot. For example, weve had a 
couple of interns from NASA that 
are contributing to this project.
The project also received as
sistance from Google for funding 
and Charmed Labs LLC for the de
sign and production of Gigapan.
The team plans to commercial
ize the product for consumers and 
introduce the product overseas.
The Gigapan camera system is 
designed to be attached to a digi
tal camera, and it allows the cam
era to capture multibillion-pixel 
panoramic images that can be 
uploaded to the Internet. Viewers
can interact with the photos on 
the Internet.
Gigapan is able to turn any 
digital camera into a personal, 
panoramic camera by using its 
tripod-like mount to capture nu
merous images that overlap one 
another.
Once the images are captured, 
Gigapan utilizes a special soft
ware that organizes all of the 
images into a grid, allowing it to

How Things Work: Lock Picking
Sruthi Chintakunta
Through the delicate han
dling of small, metal parts, 
thieves and detectives can find 
their way into buildings without 
using a key.
Lock picking involves the 
modification of a locks internal 
components. Picking a lock is 
like cracking a secret code.
Cylindrical locks are one of 
the more common types of locks 
that are found on doors. For cy
lindrical locks, keys are used to 
turn a plug inside the lock. A 
plug is a small cylinder that is 
encased in a housing.
The rotation of the plug turns 
a cam. A cam is like a miniature 
arm that extends off of the plug. 
When the cam rotates, it pulls 
on the bolt, and the door opens.
The types of cylindrical locks 
found on doors include the pinand-tumbler, wafer-tumbler, 
and tubular designs. Pin-andtumbler locks have a single row 
of pins lined up inside the lock. 
The pins are grouped into pairs, 
each of which consists of a bot
tom and top pin. Each of these 
pairs is embedded in a shaft that 
goes through the cylinder plug.
These pairs of pins are kept in 
their positions by springs that 
are connected to the top pin. In 
other words, the spring pushes 
the top pin downward by apply
ing a force, causing the top pins 
to be partly located inside the 
plug and partly inside the hous
ing that surrounds the plug.
The bottom pins, on the other 
hand, are pushed down to the 
very the bottom of the hollow 
shaft so that they are located en
tirely within the plug.
This orientation of the pins 
prevents the top and bottom 
pins from separating, and so, 
the lock cannot turn.
When the correct key is in
serted into the keyhole, these
111
S
,v.
pairs of pins are lifted upward 
so that the top pins are located 
entirely in the housing. When 
the key turns, the top and bot
tom pins separate, and the door 
unlocks. ,
It takes two tools  picks and 
tension wrenches  to pick cy
lindrical rocks. Picks are thin 
strips of metal that are used 
to modify the positions of the 
locks pins. Tension wrenches, 
on the other hand, are L-shaped 
tools that allow lock-pickers to 
hold pins in place as the door is 
unlocked.
When the tension wrench 
is inserted into the lock and 
.turned, the connection between 
the upper pin and the lower pin 
becomes disoriented.
The next step is to start rais
ing the pins by inserting the pick 
completely into the lock. The ob
jective is to lift the pins so that 
all of the top pins are located 
entirely in the housing.
The top pins make a clicking 
sound when they move to the 
housing, and the tension wrench 
helps maintain their positions.
. You have to make all the upAlan Gerber/Photo.Staff
per pins fall into position for the 
door to be unlocked, meaning 
that the pins have to rest at the 
shear line. The shear line is the 
point at which the top pins are 
located entirely in the housing.
Another method for picking 
locks is called raking. Raking 
serves the same purpose of mak
ing the upper pins and lower 
pins fall into the right position 
so that the wrench can be used 
to turn the cylindrical plug.
In raking, however, the pick 
is wider. Also, the pick is fully 
inserted into the lock and then
pulled out quickly. The hope is 
that all of the pins fall into their 
proper positions.
Locksmiths will frequently 
first use raking and then pick 
the remaining pins one by one 
more delicately.
Wafer-tumbler locks are 
similar in design to the pinand-tumbler locks, except that 
they use disks instead of pins. 
The above-mentioned method 
can be used to pick wafer-tumbler locks, and they even have 
wider keyholes than pin-andtumbler locks.
Some wafer-tumblers contain 
single wafers instead of pairs. 
These wafers are fixed in the 
lock using spring, and they at
tach to the locks housing. A key 
pulls these wafers completely 
into the plug, allowing the plug 
to turn.
Tubular locks, on the other 
hand, have rows of pins that line 
the inner surface of the plug. 
These locks are more secure 
than pin-and-tumbler locks and 
wafer-tumbler locks because 
they are so difficult to success
fully pick.
One alternative to conven
tional methods of lock picking 
is to use an electric pick gun. A 
pick gun uses the raking con
cept to open the lock by vibrat
ing inside the luck and pushing 
the pins up.
Thus, a lock gun may or may 
not be able to open the lock, as 
there is always an uncertainty 
as to whether all the upper pins 
have been lined at the shear 
line.
In addition to a steady hand, 
locksmiths need a sharp sense 
of hearing, an attribute that lock 
pickers also must have. Lock 
pickers must listen for the click 
that occurs when pins are put 
in an unlocked position, which 
indicates that the lock has been 
correctly modified.

On Thursday,NASA launched 
the Dawn spacecraft to explore 
the. asteroid Vesta and the 
dwarf planet Ceres. Dawn will 
give scientists a better idea of 
how the solar system came into

Most of Dawns speed builds 
slowly over time, so Dawn will 
take four years to reach Vesta. 
Three hundred miles in diam

Crocodiles travel 
back home
Using satellites, researchers 
have determined that croco
diles may travel up to 411 km to 
return home from foreign terri
tory in a matter of weeks.
Australian scientists attached 
tracking equipment to three 
salt-water crocodiles. They then 
moved the crocodiles to differ
ent territories, 56 km, 99 km, 
and 126 km away from their 
homes.
After a few weeks, each croc
odile set off back home, taking 
five to 20 days to get back. The 
farthest crocodile traveled a to
tal of 411 km around the coast
line.
Contrary to popular belief, 
the fact that crocodiles can 
swim for long periods of time 
suggests that they have an aero
bic (use of oxygen) metabolism. 
The experiment also shows that 
crocodiles may be using Earths 
magnetic field, substances in 
the water, and the suns position 
to get back home.

U.S. researchers are on their 
way to putting 3-D printers on 
the market. This printer is ca
pable of printing actual objects, 
such as staplers or envelopes.
The ability to print model 
objects is called rapid prototyp
ing. The printer works with the 
help of lasers. The system first 
reads a 3-D image of the object 
and then uses lasers to form the 
object out of plastic.
In the future, rapid proto
typing may be used by product 
developers to exchange proto
types of certain objects.

Birds use sight to 
detect magnetic 
fields
German researchers have re
vealed that migrating birds used 
Earths magnetic field as a guide 
for travel. Researchers suspect 
that birds see magnetic fields as 
shadows or spots of light.
Scientists have known that 
birds use magnetic fields to 
guide their travel, but up until 
now, they have not known how. 
The current study shows that 
birds depend on vision for de
tecting magnetic fields.
According to researchers on 
this project, birds have cryp
tochromes in their eyes, which 
are molecules that detect mag
netic fields. These molecules 
stimulate other cells in the eye 
that detect light, resulting in a 
visual appearance of the mag
netic field.

Carnegie Mellon develops robot for drilling moons surface
Scarab is equipped with a drill that is strategically located in the center of its body
ROBOT, from A6
student in mechanical engineer
ing who contributed to the proj
ect, a drill-centric design was 
applied to procure the greatest 
amount of downward force.
By placing the drill at the center 
of the body, the robot still applies 
sufficient downward force while 
maintaining a slim, energy-effi
cient weight of 250 kilos.
Performing in dark and frigid 
environments posed another 
challenge to Scarab developers. 
Future moon prospecting rovers 
will be expected to operate and 
navigate in the depths of craters.
The lack of light -in such en
vironments would inhibit the 
navigational capabilities of any 
rover. To counter this obstacle,
Scarabs development team is 
developing a low-power laser 
light striper and a position es
timation system that will allow 
Scarab to model its surround
ings, said Wettergreen.
The light striper projects lines 
onto the ground, which are then 
captured by a camera. After ana
lyzing the deformation of the 
stripes, the navigation system 
can determine the general layout 
of the terrain.
Mobility over the rough and 
uneven surfaces was also ad
dressed in Scarabs design.
According to Thornton, a tech
nique called differencing was 
applied to the functioning of 
Scarabs wheels and axles during 
transit. Differencing allows each 
wheel to be raised and lowered
individually in order to accom
modate turbulent terrain.
This technique allows all four 
wheels to maintain contact with 
the ground, while simultane
ously allowing the body to stay 
parallel with the surface.
The design of the rovers body 
also took mobility into consider
ation.
Because of the way the vehicle 
raises and lowers, the bottom of 
the vehicle needed to be curved 
at certain locations to go over 
small mounds and inconsisten
cies and to be able to position for 
drilling on angles and obstacles, 
said Caruso.
Furthermore, to perform its 
tasks, a lunar prospector must 
have a reliable and sustainable 
energy source.
To this end, researchers have 
utilized an advanced sterling 
radioisotope generator (ASRG). 
Wettergreen described an ASRG 
as a device that converts the 
heat of isotope decay into electri
cal power.
This generator provides energy 
at a high capacity of 10 years and 
low output at 100 watts, which 
means the rover would move 
slowly and utilize low power 
components.
If a rover needed to use more 
power for the purpose of travers
ing a slope or transmitting more 
data, it could store generator 
power in batteries. The energy 
could then be consumed faster.
The lifetime of the ASRG is 
the key to this approach. Caruso 
said, It is mission enabling to
have this power source.
Lunar prospecting is to be per
formed inside a crater as opposed 
to the lunar surface. Once inside 
the crater, NASA hopes to find 
ice, which can be converted to 
hydrogen and oxygen, or liquid 
water.
These resources would then 
be processed by In Situ Resource 
Utilization Element (ISRU) to 
support a potential lunar out
post. Although NASA has no of
ficial plans in lunar prospecting, 
Scarab has made a significant 
contribution to the technology 
for such a mission in the future.
Caruso said that lunar pros
pecting has been part of dis
cussions that have been going 
on in the scientific literature for 
years.
Sputnik launched 50 years ago
Solution highlights palladium in rock
PALLADIUM, from A6
platinum under ultraviolet (UV) 
rays, traces of palladium and plat
inum become visible to the naked 
eye.
In the publication, the team 
explains the many advantages of 
their multifaceted undertaking. 
In particular, they emphasize its 
great value to the pharmaceu
tical industry. In this industry, 
reactions that involve palladium 
as a catalyst often yield products 
that are contaminated with palla
dium. Such products are a hazard 
to peoples health.
Garner said, Most phar
maceutical corporations use a 
significant amount of palladium 
to make drugs. Certain amounts 
of palladium are never removed
 simply because they have not 
been detected. Thus, remnants 
of toxic substance find their way 
into the final product  i.e., the 
medicine.
To test their method of improv
ing the visibility of palladium, 
the investigating team brought 
samples of rock and dirt (which 
are thought to contain palladium 
and platinum deposits) into con
tact with the teams palladium
sensor solution.
The results were positive, 
meaning that researchers 
detected palladium deposits. 
Furthermore, although each 
sample was under observation 
for about one hour, traces of pal
ladium began to appear within 
the initial 10 minutes.
Garner said that the process is 
efficient and relatively simple.
Our detection method does 
not rely on any expensive or elab
orate equipment, which usually 
takes from days to weeks to detect 
traces. It is a simple, one-hour pro
cess, and is therefore more reli
able and less time-consuming, 
said Garner.
Due to its economical and con
venient nature, this method is 
applicable to almost any kind of 
manufacturing that involves pal
ladium or platinum.
Our method can be used on 
the mining site, Koide stated in 
a University of Pittsburgh press 
release. And you dont need a 
doctorate in chemistry  anyone 
can do this.
In their publication, the 
chemists suggest that while it is 
advisable to use a UV lamp when 
trying to find palladium at a min
ing site, in most cases, the metal 
can also be detected without UV.
As stated by Garner, the team is 
in communication with Stillwater 
Mining Company, one of the 
worlds leading manufacturers of 
platinum group metals and the 
sole producer of palladium in the 
West. The group has successfully 
conducted conclusive tests based 
on their palladium sensor for the 
multinational organization. The 
company intends to use this tech
nology for detecting palladium 
deposits in mines. This experi
ment has also successfully been 
carried out with a commercial 
aspirin tablet.
The extent of this discovery 
came about as a surprise, said 
Garner. We had obviously antici
pated the chemistry to work, but 
such remarkable visibility of the 
metals was beyond our expecta
tions, she said.

after its launch into space.
In the U.S., the launch of 
Sputnik I raised concerns about 
the technological capabilities of 
the USSR, Americas Cold War 
adversary. The ability to launch 
a satellite into space suggested 
that the USSR might also be able 
to launch nuclear missiles at the 
U.S.
Te launch of Sputnik I spurred 
the beginning of the Space Age 
a time during which the United 
States and USSR competed for 
superiority in space exploration.
After one failed attempt at 
launching a satellite into space, 
the U.S. launched Explorer I in 
January 1958, several months 
after Sputnik I. The satellite 
used on-board instrumentation 
to measure radiation levels sur
rounding Earth.
The U.S. also created the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) in 1958 
in response to Sputnik. The 
Eisenhower administration 
formed NASA for the purpose 
of advancing non-military space 
missions.
The USSR launched a second 
satellite, Sputnik II, about one 
month after Sputnik I. Sput
nik II was the first spacecraft to 
have a passenger on board  
dog named Laika. The dog died 
shortly after the spacecrafts 
launch due to overheating.
Robotic device to foster education
GIGAPAN, from A6
compress and stitch together the 
images to create one, multibillion 
pixel image.
The Gigapan has already been 
used for a variety of purposes. The 
Pennsylvania Board of Tourism, 
for instance, used the Gigapan to 
take pictures of Civil War sites.
In a way this is a new organi
zational medium and its a new 
media, stated Illah Nourbakhsh, 
associate professor in the School 
of Computer Sciences Robotics 
Institute, in a Carnegie Mellon 
press release.
Nourbakhsh described the 
Gigapan as a way of exchanging 
information in the community 
sense.
Developers of the Gigapan have 
also been in discussion with the 
United Nations Educational, Sci
entific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) to begin a project for 
educating children from differ
ent parts of the world about each 
others cultures through the pan
oramic abilities of the Gigapan. 
This particular project is already 
underway, and it promises to con
nect children from areas such as 
Pittsburgh, South Africa, Trini
dad, and Tobago.
Imagery has the power to 
educate what you cant do with 
words, Tomokiyo said.
You can cross cultural bound
aries, you can cross linguistic 
boundaries; I think our chal
lenge is to figure how to put it 
in the hands of the people who 
need it. We want to give a voice 
to children in rural communities 
in Africa and urban communities 
in Southeast Asia to tell their sto
ries and to share their stories with 
each other  and along the way, 
strengthening their own sense 
of identity by communicating 
through imagery.
The use of the Gigapan is also 
expected to improve techni
cal literacy among the public by 
introducing Robot250, a robot
ics program that teaches its par
ticipants how to build customized 
robots. This program is due to 
appear as a summer program in 
Carnegie Mellon by 2008.
There are a number of other 
applications [for Gigapan], 
Tomokiyo said. People are 
constantly coming to us with dif
ferent ideas. Looking at things 
like safety in a lab setting, for ex
ample, you could use the Gigapan 
to assess the aftermath of an ac
cident and be able to go back and
look at the things you forgot to 
look at before.
In addition, the Gigapan team 
has started beta testing proce
dures of the Gigapan website, 
which will allow users to explore 
the detailed images in a manner 
similar to Google Earth. This 
means that users will be able to 
zoom in on concentrated parts 
of a large image (for example, an 
image of a landscape) with little 
sacrifice of quality.
The website is currently avail
able to the public and offers free 
subscription for its services.
We would be doing the same 
as a number of other projects if, 
in fact, we were making such 
professional panoramas and put
ting them on the web  there are 
people who do that, stated Nour
bakhsh, but... we want anybody 
to be able to do this and so we 
take it two steps further.
Aside from the educational 
prospects, the Gigapan also has 
use in the sciences. Develop
ers plan to collaborate with the 
Fine Foundation of Pittsburgh to 
provide Gigapans to scientists in 
various fields.
Were not interested in becom
ing just another photo-sharing 
site, stated Nourbakhsh.

The Gigapan is capable of taking multi billion pixel pictures, and it attaches to any digital camera.

Universities are not RIAAs watchmen
In July, Senator Harry Reid (D - 
Nev.) put forth a new amendment to 
the Higher Education Act. Had it been 
passed, it would have required the top 25 
schools that use peer-to-peer file sharing 
networks to enforce anti-downloading 
technology across campus. This means 
that universities would have been legally 
required to fight illegal downloading 
and report on the measures taken to the 
MPAA and the RIAA (who would have 
maintained the top-25 list).
Although the amendment was 
dropped, issues remain. As Charles 
Nesson and John Palfrey, two members 
of the Harvard Law Schools Berkman 
Center for Internet & Society, wrote in a 
letter in June, Universities should have
no part in this extraordinary process. 
They go on to implore that universities 
across the country not respond to the 
RIAAs early settlement letters request
ing students names because they are 
under no obligation to do so. Carnegie 
Mellon should heed their suggestions.
Carnegie Mellon is one of the univer
sities that received a pre-litigation notice 
and has since received 13 early settle
ment letters. Does Carnegie Mellon 
have a legal obligation to hand over 
those 13 names to the RIAA? No.
You might ask how many letters 
Harvard has received since Nesson and 
Palfreys letter was published. Zero.
The RIAA, even with the massive 
monetary and legal cachet that it holds,
is intimidated by actual legal battles. 
How many court cases has the RIAA 
won in the last four years against illegal 
downloaders? Also zero, but their first 
jury trial is set to begin next Tuesday, so 
stay tuned.
At this point it seems likely that the 
RIAA is going to have to distinctively 
change its strategies. Forcing college 
students (or more realistically, their par
ents) to give up a few thousand dollars 
isnt going to fix anything in the long 
run. We want Carnegie Mellon to stand 
up with Harvard and agree that a univer
sity is not a policeman for the recording 
industry. The best way to knock down 
a bully is to simply stand up to them, a 
truth Harvard Law has clearly proven.
Editor-in-chief, First Amendment get canned?
More than 500 people gathered at 
Colorado State University Thursday to 
discuss the use of four words. The words 
were those of David McSwane, editor-inchief of The Rocky Mountain Collegian, 
who wrote and printed an editorial that 
read Taser this: Fuck Bush. McSwane 
claimed that he meant for the editorial 
to spark controversy on the campus, a 
campus which he perceived as politi
cally apathetic.
Though many members of the Colo
rado State community (including some 
members of the newspapers staff) 
are calling for the editor-in-chiefs 
resignation, McSwanes choice of words 
should legally be protected by the First
Amendment. Any forced resignation 
would be a major blow to journalistic 
freedom of speech.
And though the editor-in-chiefs posi
tion should be safe if the Colorado State 
officials decide to respect First Amend
ment rights, its certainly true that Mc
Swane would have done a better edito
rial job by providing context for the bold 
anti-Bush statement. Instead, McSwane 
chose not to share his political views or 
implore the student body to take politi
cal action. He did not seek to educate the 
readers of The Collegian, but did succeed 
in offending a great deal of them.
For the newspaper to be taken seri
ously and for the editor-in-chief to be
regarded as a professional, McSwane 
should have written an article, not just a 
headline. He also might have considered 
that whatever he chooses to print implic
itly reflects the values of the newspaper 
and its staff as a whole.
After the Thursday hearing, officials 
decided to postpone the decision as 
to whether or not McSwane should be 
fired from his position on The Collegian. 
While we hope that Colorado State Uni
versity respects McSwanes right to print 
controversial articles, we also hope that 
in the future, McSwane will respect the 
integrity of college journalism by pro
viding well-argued, intelligent social 
criticism.
Hate crimes bill may not get past Dubya
Last Thursday, the Senate officially 
passed the Matthew Shepard Act, a hate 
crimes legislation bill named after the 
college student who, in 1997, was beaten 
to death and left tied to a fence in Lara
mie, Wyo.  because he was gay.
Current hate crime laws limit the 
definition of a hate crime to those pun
ishable acts committed due to bias 
against a particular race or religion. 
Furthermore; a crime directed at some
one can only be charged as a hate crime 
if it intends to deter a person from per
forming a federally regulated activity, 
such as voting or going to school.
The Senates efforts are particularly 
laudable because this new bill, if signed 
into law, would extend the scope of hate 
crimes to those committed because of 
bias against sexual orientation, gender, 
and disability. Furthermore, it would
eliminate the federal activity require
ment.
Similar attempts have failed in the 
past, but with a Democrat-controlled 
House, the bill now has the best chance 
of becoming a law. However, it remains 
unclear if President Bush will sign the 
new legislation. The White House has 
issued no formal statement on what it 
intends to do, but Dubya made previous 
mentions of vetoing such legislation.
The President isnt alone in his dis
taste. Though the Democrats votecl 
unanimously in favor of the bill, many 
Republicans voted against it because 
they believed it unfairly penalized par
ticular perpetrators of crimes because 
of their thoughts. Chicago Tribune col
umnist Steve Chapman questioned the 
new bills usefulness, writing, murder 
is against the law, even in Wyoming,
and... Shepards attackers are now serv
ing sentences (life in prison) that would 
not be any longer if this law had been in 
effect then.
True, murder is murder. However, 
theres a difference between murder
ing a random person and murdering a 
person of a particular community in or
der to intimidate the other members of 
that community. This bill also makes it 
possible to punish acts of intimidation 
aside from murder. For any gay store 
owner who has had the word faggot 
spray-painted across his door, or for 
any woman who has been intimidated 
to leave a male-dominated career field, 
this bill could surely be welcome relief.
If President Bush vetoes the bill, twothirds of the House and Senate will have 
to vote in favor of the bill to pass it again. 
We say: Keep pushing.
Everyones a little bit racist, 
but admit it and learn from it
Selena Beckman-Harned
When our ancestors started leaving 
Africa 200,000 years ago, eventually 
spreading across the globe, the skin of 
those ancient Yankees who settled in 
the north slowly grew paler because 
there wasnt as much ultraviolet light 
to block out; those who lived nearer the 
equator had darker skin. If you map out 
the worlds skin colors on a globe, you 
see a smooth gradient spilling across 
the continents  pale to dark to pale.
Thanks a lot, sunshine. You know 
what your pesky cheery rays have done? 
Take a look.
Two weeks ago, Bill OReilly told 
viewers of his show how amazed he 
was that Sylvias restaurant in Harlem, 
which he visited with the Reverend 
Al Sharpton, seemed a lot like a white 
people restaurant. Earlier this year, talk 
show host Don Imus lost his job for mak
ing what many considered to be a racist 
comment about Rutgers basketball 
players. At the same time, debate 
rages across the nation about whether 
presidehtial candidate Barack Obama is 
really black since hes not descended 
from slaves', anyone vaguely brown risks 
extra hours of being searched by airport 
security, were hiring Mexicans to build 
a wall on our border with Mexico, kids 
sit with people who look like them in 
the school cafeteria, and, of course, 
all around the world people are killing 
each other for reasons of race far subtler 
than skin colors.
But not you, of course. Youre not 
racist, right? Think again, bucko. Have 
you ever crossed the street because two 
big, tough, black guys were coming your 
way? Have you ever assumed some
one Asian was smart, someone Middle 
Eastern was sexist, someone black was 
good at sports? Have you ever hoped 
you wouldnt hear an Indian voice 
when you called tech support? When 
describing someone white, do you talk 
about their hair and clothes, but when 
describing someone whos not white, 
do you name their race? Have you ever 
made an ethnic joke?
Everyones a little bit racist. Listen 
to our friends at Avenue Q. And you can 
bet your butt (whatever color it may be) 
that none of the people I mentioned be
fore (from OReilly to Obamas critics) 
will admit to being racist. How many 
times do you hear someone say, Im not 
racist, but... ?
Its time to give up the fantasy. Youre 
racist. All of you. And Im not exonerat
ing myself. Most of my friends are as 
pasty white as me, probably because 
Im more likely to approach people who 
look like me. Being racist doesnt mean 
youre a bigot  it just means you judge
people by their skin, mostly uncon
sciously.
Admitting the problem is the first 
step to overcoming it. So admit it. Stand 
up in front of the Racists Anonymous 
meeting inside your skull and say, Hi. 
My name is So-and-So and Im racist. 
Hi, So-and-So. You cant retrain your 
brains snap judgment center until you 
admit to its existence. Admit youre rac
ist, and then youll think twice the next 
time youre about to judge somebody.
Our nation is certainly not ready to 
admit its racist  the trend, in fact, is 
to be as politically correct as possible. 
Students studying abroad in Europe 
find themselves fumbling to describe 
black people overseas  they cant 
be French African-Americans, obvi
ously, so what do we call them? Help! 
We fumble over our words trying to 
ask Asian friends which country theyre 
from without sounding racist. Theres 
also a whole dictionary of words that 
people of a certain race  and no one 
else  can use to refer to themselves 
without being racist. And though race 
relations pervade our lives every day, 
God forbid you make a joke about race, 
especially if youre not a member of that 
race yourself. My Jewish friends might 
make a joke about Jews, but if they do 
they quickly explain, Oh, Im Jewish, 
to anyone nearby to absolve themselves 
of any blame. If Jews mock Jews, is that 
okay? What if blacks mock whites? Is 
that qkay, because were the major
ity and deserve to be made fun of? If I 
were half black and half white, with a 
Cherokee grandma, Jewish mom, and 
Chinese half-sister, could I mock basi
cally everybody?
Theres a big difference between jokes 
that stem from good-natured observa
tions of human behavior and jokes that 
are intended to hurt. If we condemn all 
jokes and comments about race as evil, 
then were deliberately avoiding a huge 
area of deeply wacky human behavior. 
Plus, poking fun at ourselves is one of 
the best ways to accept our weird racist 
selves for who we are.
So admityoure racist. Thenstandyour 
racist self up and meet some new friends 
from other cultures. If you find out that 
their culture is surprisingly like yours in 
ways, its okay not to say so on national 
television like our friend Mr. OReilly. 
Or go check out one of the meetings of 
an ethnic-related group on campus. Its 
okay if youre the only white guy rolling 
sushi or the only Latina checking out 
the traditional Indian dancing. Admit 
youre racist and you wont be nervous 
about offending people anymore. Then 
we can start learning to look beyond the 
suns handiwork.

pale, its not even funny. She welcomes 
comments from all colors of people.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 1, 2007
Share your ideas 
with the student 
body president
Sean Weinstock and Adi Jain
Hello, Carnegie Mellon. In 
case you dont know who I am, 
my name is Sean, and Im the 
new student body president. Af
ter three elections and a little 
extra debate on the side, I am 
happy to finally get cracking on 
the reforms mentioned in my 
campaign, which are the CMU
5 (shameless plug: www.cmu5. 
com).
Every past student body presi
dent has written the Presiden
tial Perspectives column weekly 
in The Tartan, and Im happy to 
continue that tradition. However, 
one of the changes Im planning 
on instituting is that if I dont 
have anything relevant to tell the 
campus, Ill at least try my best to 
make the column funny. If youre 
like me, you may have paid at
tention to the Perspectives on 
occasion, but mostly just skipped 
to Crime and Incident instead 
because it is often times more 
amusing. Maybe now you wont. 
Not that theres anything funny 
about crime... or incident.
Basically, heres how its going 
to work: If the world is about to 
blow up, and I somehow know 
about it before you do, I will be 
very serious and elaborate on 
how to properly duck, tuck, and 
roll, or how to climb under your 
desk while making sure your 
head is safely protected from 
flying glass, ceiling tiles, and 
mechanical pencils. If theres 
nothing that you should really be 
concerned about, I will find the 
best clean joke or story I can and 
write it out.
This week, Im going to be se
rious about my desire to engage 
in conversations with everyone 
who has ever thought about any
thing that could make Carnegie 
Mellon a cooler or better place. 
I dont care if your idea involves 
instituting a bass fishing trip for 
all first-years  I want to hear it. 
Because my vice president, Adi 
Jain, and I are only two people, 
we can only get 48 hours out of 
a day. Realizing this, we see that 
we may not be the best champi
ons for all of the ideas we want to 
promote because of our time con
straints. This is why we hope that 
you, the one with the idea, will 
help us. If youre willing to put 
the effort forward to make the 
idea a reality, Adi and I promise 
that we will fight for those ideas 
when we meet with people like 
Jennifer Church, Michael Mur
phy, Indira Nair, Jared Cohon, 
and others.
Adi and I do not believe that 
because we hold the positions of 
student body vice president and 
president, respectively, that we 
are the only ones responsible or 
able to make change at Carnegie 
Mellon. The burden to make this 
place better falls on all of our 
shoulders, and we will all reap 
the rewards.
For a dollar, you can get coffee or tea at Entropy, a Twix from the vending machine, or print 20 pages of text. So we asked,
What is the craziest thing you would do for a dollar?A PERSONS OPINION

Lethal injection under fire: Should executions be painless?
Amanda Cole
Two men on death row in 
Kentucky are going to court to 
try to declare lethal injections 
a form of cruel and unusual 
punishment, restrictions 
against which are found in the 
Eighth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. The men claim that 
the chemicals used in lethal injec
tions cause unbearable pain.
Currently, most states have laws 
about the death penalty. Methods 
of execution range from hanging 
to lethal injection, with several 
other methods in between. The 
petition of the Kentucky inmates 
will be heard by the Supreme 
Court, but the only method of 
execution questioned will be 
lethal injections  the death pen
alty itself will not be examined.
All forms of capital punishment 
are brutal  ending someones 
life has never been considered a 
light punishment  but if prison
ers are sentenced to death, lethal 
injections are probably the least 
cruel and unusual method avail
able. When people are sentenced
to death by lethal injection, they 
receive three separate injections. 
The first puts the inmate to sleep, 
like an anesthetic. The second 
paralyzes the inmate, and the 
third injection stops the inmates 
heart. If the execution isconducted properly, the prisoner should 
die soon after the process begins.
Unfortunately, many situations 
arise in which the process pro
ceeds incorrectly. The injections 
are generally administered by 
prison staff, not by doctors. This 
means that there is often a lack 
of training, and mistakes can be 
made more easily. For example, 
if the injections are accidentally 
inserted into muscle tissue rather 
than into a vein, extreme pain will 
occur. If the inmate was a drug 
user, veins are difficult to find. In 
cases such as these, the execution 
process results in severe pain.
Some medical studies have 
reported, however, that even 
when administered properly, the 
drugs cause pain. The second 
drug injected only paralyzes the 
muscles, not the nerves or the 
brain. Therefore, the prisoners 
might feel pain but be unable to 
show it. The first drug, too, is 
often improperly administered,
allowing the inmates to be con
scious during their executions. 
Unfortunately, complications 
do arise during executions, 
regardless of which method is 
employed. The complications
from lethal injections, however, 
are the least cruel and unusual 
among them.
When other methods of execu
tion go wrong, the results can 
be far worse. For example, when 
people are hanged, if the prisoner 
is too light or the rope is the wrong 
length, the prisoner will die slow
ly and painfully because his or her 
neck will not snap. There is even 
a risk of decapitation. With the 
electric chair, prisoners are often 
not killed after only one jolt, and 
their eyes can pop out of their 
sockets and onto their cheeks. In 
some states, gas chambers (simi
lar to those used in Nazi concen
tration camps) and firing squads 
are still used as legal methods of
execution.
Lethal injection is the most 
common execution method in the 
U.S., and arguably the least cruel. 
While no method of execution is 
necessarily painless, lethal injec
tions have the best chance of suc
ceeding quickly. Other methods 
of execution can last for hours, 
and the prisoners are forced to 
suffocate or fry.
Besides, executions shouldnt 
necessarily be painless. When a 
man (or woman) is sentenced 
to death, a certain amount of 
pain should be anticipated by 
both the executioner and the exe
cuted. It is unrealistic to expect 
a complete absence of pain. If 
executions were supposed to be 
painless, they probably wouldnt 
be a form of punishment for 
things like premeditated murder. 
The question of what is cruel 
and unusual punishment rests 
with the amount of pain caused:
How much is too much? The two 
inmates petitioning the court are 
hoping that the judges decide 
that the pain caused by lethal 
injections is too much.
Looking at this case in par
ticular, its hard to believe that 
the prisoners really think lethal 
injections amount to cruel and 
unusual punishment. Their 
actions may just be desperate 
attempts to escape the death 
penalty altogether. One of the 
prisoners was scheduled to be 
executed earlier this week, and 
may only be resisting what was 
going to be his certain demise. 
While his execution is delayed, 
however, it is unlikely that it will 
be canceled. With the crimes 
committed by the men  both 
are convicted of double homi
cides  it is improbable that 
the courts will decide to lighten 
their punishment.
The men might, in fact, end up 
with a result they dislike more
 a death more painful than 
the one offered by the lethal 
injections.

Students cant access the software they want, when they want it
ter availability hours. A website 
also gives this information, but 
I had a hard time finding it. 
I had looked many times for 
this information on the com
puting website. I entered search 
queries such as cluster avail
ability, cluster hours, classes 
in clusters, cluster schedule, 
and more on the universitys 
main page. As it would happen, 
I finally went to the comput
ing services site, where if you 
click on the clusters & printing 
link on the sidebar, and then go 
to reservations, and then click 
todays reservations on the 
right, you can finally see what 
classes are in the clusters. Of 
course, you cant actually see 
anything in the future as far as 
I could tell, which is mildly inef
ficient.
The main problem I have with 
computing on campus is not that 
you cant find absolutely every 
program you want in every clus
ter, or that you cant use any 
cluster whenever you feel so 
inclined. Its more that the infor
mation about when there are 
classes in specific clusters and 
also which clusters carry what 
software is not easy enough for 
students to find. In addition, 
the vast number of private clus
ters on campus helps to further 
divide our students, and doesnt 
allow people to explore vari
ous interests through the use of 
interesting software. I shouldnt 
be going on a two-hour search 
just to find out when a class is 
going to get out of the CFA PC 
cluster. And for a campus that 
is self-proclaimed as diverse, 
when it comes to computer soft
ware, Carnegie Mellon does not 
do a very good job at bringing 
together students of various dis
ciplines.
Shaleya Solomon fssolomon@J is 
a junior biomedical and mechani
cal engineering major who thinks 
that C@CM is not a good enough 
reason to completely close a clus
ter, and wishes software wasnt so 
expensive so she could have her 
own copy of things.
Shaleya Solomon
It was 2:15 p.m. when I left my 
room to go to a cluster to print 
my homework (due at 3:30 p.m.) 
using special drafting software. 
Thirty-five minutes later, I dashed 
into my fourth cluster, desperate 
to print my homework and drop 
it off across campus in Scaife Hall 
before my 3:30 p.m. class. Why 
did I have to go to four separate 
clusters to print one homework 
assignment? I wondered the 
same thing as I moved from clus
ter to cluster. The ADAMS draft
ing software that I needed is only 
available on PCs  fine. But why 
didnt every campus PC have the 
software? And why did I find that 
all the clusters that did have the 
software were closed?
This story is not an uncommon 
one. The lack of computer pro
gram compatibility across cam
pus is debilitating, at the very 
least, to students. Many clusters 
do not feature the same software 
and applications. This only makes 
it harder for students to find an 
appropriate place to do their 
homework if they need certain 
software and applications.
So how do we fix this? 
Obviously it would be way too 
expensive to buy a lot of majorspecific software for every single 
computer on campus. A good 
example of this is that my Intro 
to Biomechanics class is getting a 
deal with the company that man
ufactures the physical simulator 
program Working Model. The 
typical student retail price for 
Working Model is about $400 
(private ownership costs more 
than educational purchase). In 
class, each student will have 
to pay about $60 because our 
professor promised to buy at 
least 10 licenses for it. Thats 
a great discount, but its still 
pretty expensive.
That being said, I absolutely 
do not expect the university to 
go all out and buy a million 
licenses just so every computer
can have everything. Obviously 
theyre not going to buy Adobe 
Illustrator for every single Mac 
on campus when only a frac
tion of students use it. However, 
some software is only available 
in private clusters. Lets create a 
scenario: All PC clusters on cam
pus have SolidWorks available. 
However, you want to use a more 
advanced version of SolidWorks, 
with, say, the COSMOSXpress 
add-in. You would most likely 
have to go to a private cluster. 
But which one? There is a website 
that tells what software is avail
able in which clusters. However, 
it only gives information for pub
lic clusters. What about the pri
vate ones? And if you were, say, 
an art major with a passion for 
flow vis, you most likely would 
not be able to get into a cluster
where you could use a flow vis 
program, due to the restricted 
access of private clusters.
There are also some computers 
that dont have basic functions  
and Im still not entirely sure why. 
The first floor of Hunt Library 
features a group of computers 
that are mostly for a quick e-mail 
check and a Cameo search, which 
is fair. However, continue around 
the corner a little bit and there are 
two other groups of computers. 
Not one of the computers on 
the first floor feature Microsoft 
Office. Why cant I type an essay 
on the first floor of the library? In 
the Engineering & Science Library 
(which I affectionately refer to 
as ESL) there are about 12 or 
so computers. These computers 
are also apparently not meant for 
students to do extended amounts
David Kjos/Art Editor
of work on  none of them fea
ture SSH, which is what PCs use 
to access AFS. ESL also doesnt 
have programs that engineering 
and science students might want 
to use, like MATLAB. It seems a 
little strange given the name of 
the library and all.
Another major issue during my 
crazed cluster search was the fact 
that there were CSW  excuse 
me, C@CM  classes pretty 
much everywhere I went. Ive had 
more than my fair share of times 
where I couldnt go into a cluster 
because there was a class in it. 
It would be nice to know ahead 
of time that there are classes in 
certain clusters, so you dont have 
to go there and find out the hard 
way, wasting time and energy. 
Some clusters do feature signs

30-24 and 30-17. Though they 
would lose their next two games 
26-30 and 15-30, the Tartans 
recovered to defeat the Spartans 
in the final game 15-8.
After starting out a bit shaky 
with a record of 4-6, the Tar
tans have turned on the engine, 
winning five of their last seven 
matches.
I think were on a role, Carter 
said. Especially taking Wash
ington to five games, it shows 
what were capable of.
The Tartans continue their 
season this weekend with the 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational. 
Over the two-day event, the 
Tartans will face off against the 
likes of Franklin and Marshall 
College, Lake Erie College, and 
the University of PittsburghGreensburg.
I think now we are in the 
groove and that it is all uphill 
from here, Amaechi said. The 
Tartans begin their climb this 
Friday night at 6:30 p.m. against 
Franklin and Marshall in the UC

followed by a header right past 
W & J goalie Jackie Foltz re
sulted in Coffins third, and the 
teams fourth, goal of the night. 
Rose netted her second assist for 
the game.
Less than two minutes later, 
Coffin finished off her night after 
the team quickly stole a pass off 
the drop ball and rushed right 
back to the opposing goalie box. 
Coffin gained control off a Corvino pass, dribbled around the 
goalkeeper, and finished the job 
with an easy put away.
Corvino finished off the Tar
tan scoring in the 66th minute 
as she turned her second break
away of the night into her second 
goal of the night when she beat 
Foltz with a chip shot over into 
the top of the net. Kate Smith 
was credited with an assist on 
the play.
Carnegie Mellon first-year 
goalkeeper Anya Rosen nearly 
lost the shutout around the 70th 
minute of play. With 10 players 
jumbled within 10 yards of the 
Tartans net, a President mid
fielder gained possession from 
about 5 yards out and rifled a 
shot to the left corner of the net, 
but Rosen was able to dive and 
deflect the ball out of bounds.
It was definitely a full team 
effort and easily the best offen
sive effort weve had all year, 
Coffin said, when asked about 
her record-breaking night.
Head coach Sue Willard was
also very pleased with the ef
fort her team put forth. I wasnt 
concerned about the rain delay 
because coming out of the locker 
room we were real focused and 
ready, she said. This was also 
the first game where we had the 
opportunity to use all our play
ers and I was happy with how 
each player was dangerous and 
made the most of the opportu
nity given to them.
Yesterday, the team traveled 
to St. Louis to take on an unde
feated Wash. U. team. The Bears 
had won their past 23 games. 
Unfortunately, the Tartans were 
unable to end that streak as they 
fell 2-0 to Wash. U.
Threatening early on a Rose 
corner kick, junior Sarah DeWath 
took a shot on goal in the 18th 
minute, but Bears goalie Carrie 
Sear was able to make the save. 
Just before the half Rose again 
gained possession in Bears terri
tory, but her shot on goal turned 
into Sears second save of the 
night.
The scoring all came within 
three minutes. In the 71st min
ute of play, Bears substitute 
Julie Tembunkiart scored from
20 yards out, unassisted, on an 
open net. Just three minutes 
later, Caryn Rosoff nailed an
other 20-yard shot into the far 
corner of the Tartan net.
This week, the womens soccer 
team will host Allegheny College 
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and the 
University of Chicago Saturday 
at 1:30 p.m.

defensively. They get everyone 
behind the ball in their half of 
the field and defend pretty much. 
If you watched the game, we 
held the ball for 80 percent of the 
possession. Its just frustrating 
having them score with less than 
10 seconds left in the first half.
Its a character win for us, com

she came in third place at the na

she failed to escape the regional 
tournament.
Staloch, however, showed her 
mettle and bounced back, win
ning the doubles title with Chui 
and advancing to the national
tournament. This is Stalochs first 
trip to the national tournament 
in doubles; she was runner-up 
at the regional tournament with 
alumna Mona Iyer last year. 
Staloch got a bit of revenge: She 
and Chui beat Caire and partner 
Katie Tabb in the doubles final.
Im really excited and nervous 
for nationals. College tennis has 
been such a blast, and I love the
team atmosphere, Chui said. I 
love how there is an emphasis 
on doubles, and its great hav
ing Amy as a partner. Shes really 
supportive and has a lot of expe
rience being a senior on the team, 
which helps calm my nerves. 
Staloch was upbeat after the 
tournament. I am thrilled about 
going to nationals. I love the com
petition at nationals but am most
excited for Jenn getting to go as a 
freshman. She is so talented and 
fun to play with and really de
serves to go. All of the freshmen 
bring a lot of enthusiasm to the 
team as they are all excited to be 
competing, she said.
Staloch and Chui will represent 
Carnegie Mellon and compete at 
the ITA national championships 
in two weeks.

Tennis tandem, Staloch and Chui, win ITA regionals
by Matthew E. Campbell
Copy Manager
Members of the Carnegie 
Mellon womens tennis team 
competed at the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association (ITA) regional 
tournament at the University 
of Mary Washington in Freder
icksburg, Va., Saturday, Sept. 22 
through Monday, Sept. 24. The 
players were bidding for a spot 
in the ITA National Small College
Championships at Florida Gulf 
Coast University, to be held Oct.
11-14.
The Carnegie Mellon first-years 
continued to make a splash early 
in the season. Jennifer Chui, 
Kelly Hart, and Brooke Loar all 
won two matches on the first day 
of play to advance to the round of
16. The doubles team of Chui and 
senior Amy Staloch got through 
to the quarterfinals of the dou
bles tournament on the first day 
of the tournament as well.
On the second day of play, Hart 
looked like the third seed in her 
6-2,6-1 win over the actual third 
seed, Stephanie Kurti of Mary 
Washington. Harts surprising 
run ended in the quarterfinals, 
though, with a 6-4, 1-6, 1-6 
loss. Loar lost a close match 6-7 
(6), 5-7 and was eliminated in 
the round of 16.
Staloch and Chui both ad
vanced to the quarterfinals. 
However, one of them could not 
advance past this stage  the
draw had fated them to play each 
other. Putting aside their doubles 
partnership temporarily, Staloch 
prevailed 6-2, 6-4 over Chui to 
advance to the semifinals.
My personal goal for my 
senior year of tennis is to play 
every match with a good atti
tude, Staloch said. It will be my 
last opportunity to play at this 
level in this environment, and I 
dont want to have regrets about 
matches I didnt give my all to.
Staloch and Chui proved
unstoppable when on the same 
side of the net. On the second 
day of the tournament, they won 
two matches 8-4 and 8-5 to ad
vance to the final of the doubles 
competition.
On the third and final day of 
the tournament, Staloch faced 
off against Washington & Lee 
player Lauren Caire. Staloch was 
stunned by Caire 6-1, 7-6 (2).

Mens soccer tamed at Wash. U.; lose to the Bears 3-2
by Doug Fricker
Senior Sports Staff
The mens soccer team opened 
up its University Athletic Associ
ation (UAA) season on Saturday 
with a stiff test, traveling to St. 
Louis to play lOth-ranked Wash-. 
ington (Mo.) University. The 
Bears handed the Tartans their 
first loss of the season, beating 
them 3-2 with all five goals com
ing in the second half. Earlier 
last week, Carnegie Mellon came 
from behind to defeat the Grove 
City Wolverines 2-1 at Gesling 
Stadium..
Against Washington (7-2 over
all, 1-0 in UAA), Carnegie Mellon 
(6-1,0-1) struck first, with junior 
midfielder Dan Brackley scoring 
off a shot from 20 yards out to the 
near corner in the 65th minute. 
The Bears answered with a trio 
of goals coming in the 71st, 73rd, 
and 77th minutes.
Carnegie Mellon sophomore 
midfielder Ryan Browne nar
rowed the deficit to one g^al in 
the 87th minute, when he scored 
his third goal of the season off 
a penalty kick, but the Tartans 
were unable to push across the 
tying goal.
Tartan junior goalkeeper Mat

the loss. Carnegie Mellon took 14 
shots compared to Washingtons 
16.

speed and the physical play in 
the UAA are something that go
ing through two years ago, my 
freshman year, I was not ready 
for, Bazin said. The players are 
a lot bigger, the teams are more 
physical, and Wash. U. is very 
good this year.
Last Tuesday night, the Tartans 
beat Grove City thanks to a solid 
second half and sophomore for
ward Ricky Griffins right foot.
Grove City senior Paul Cardi
nal picked a good time to score 
his first goal of the season, as he 
gave the Wolverines a 1-0 lead
with only six seconds left in the 
first half. Cardinal received a 
pass from senior Eli Lamborn and 
took a shot from the right side of 
the box past Bazin and into the

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team hosted the Wash
ington & Jefferson Presidents 
last Wednesday and visited the 
Washington (Mo.) University 
Bears Sunday. The Tartans split 
the two games to put their record 
at 5-4 for the season.
On Wednesday, heavy rains 
soaked the field at Gesling Sta
dium, but that didnt dampen the 
spirit of the womens soccer team 
as they rolled to a 6-0 victory 
over W & J. Following a two-hour 
rain delay, Carnegie Mellon took 
the field and struck the Presi
dents early.
The first Tartan goal came 
in the eighth minute of play as 
junior forward Abby Coffin onetimed the ball off the crossbar. 
Seniors Amanda Rose and Kasey 
Stever assisted in the play. This 
was just the beginning as Coffin 
went on to score four goals on the 
night, a new Carnegie Mellon re
cord for goals scored by a single 
player.
As the rain fell harder, Cof
fin scored her second goal in the 
17th minute, with an assist from 
sophomore Casey Garth. Cof
fin crossed over from the left, 
beat the keeper, and put the ball 
away. First-year midfielder Val

The Carnegie Mellon Tartans 
continued their hot streak, win
ning two out of three matches 
last weekend in the Round 
Robin Tournament at New York 
University. The two wins for the 
Tartans brought their season re
cord to 9-8.
On the first day of tourna
ment play, the Tartans squared 
off against Washington (Mo.) 
University, ranked seventh in 
the nation. The Tartans would 
not let the rankings intimidate 
them.
The fact that they were 
ranked so highly pumped us up 
a lot and gave us a lot of energy, 
sophomore setter Samantha 
Carter said. The Wash. U. Bears 
displayed their experience in 
tournament play by jumping 
out to a quick two-match lead 
with scores of 30-23 and 30-27, 
respectively.
The Tartans conveyed the 
meaning of never say die as 
they came back and won the 
next two matches by scores of 
30-27 and 30-28, respectively, 
to force a final and decisive 
match.
We felt like we had nothing 
to lose so we felt like we could 
go all out in the match, junior 
middle hitter Chisom Amaechi 
said. Though the Tartans put up 
a valiant effort, they would fall 
short of victory with a 15-7 loss 
in the fifth and final match. I 
was proud but also hungry for 
that win, Carter said.
Amaechi led the offense 
for the Tartans with 15 kills. 
Carter, reigning University Ath
letic Association Player of the 
Week, also aided the offense, 
providing 53 assists during the 
game. Meanwhile three other 
Tartans would help out the 
offense by scoring in double
digit kills. Senior Abbie Toney 
provided 10 kills, sophomore 
Jessica Brackin scored 13, and 
first-year outside hitter Caro
line Size supplied 11.
Despite the loss, the Tartans 
would not let the match faze 
them. They continued their 
tournament play by success
fully winning two games on 
Sunday against the University 
of Chicago and Case Western 
Reserve University.
In the first game against 
Chicago the Tartans proved 
their ability. Despite losing 
the first match of the game 
24-30, the Tartans hung on and 
took the next three matches 
30-20, 30-28, and 30-26, 
respectively.
The Tartans did not stop there. 
In their second game of the day 
against Case the team took

Last Friday, the top runners 
from the mens and womens 
cross country team traveled to 
Lehigh University to compete in 
the Paul Short Invitational. The 
mens top seven runners ran in 
the varsity 8K race against tough 
Division I and III competition. 
The mens team placed 19th out 
of 41 teams with 599 points, 
while Villanova University took 
first with 50 points.
The womens team partici
pated in the Division III varsity 
6K race. The women finished 
22nd out of 33 teams with 544 
points, while SUN Y Cortland fin
ished first with 158 points.
For the mens team, junior 
Brian Harvey returned from an 
injury to finish 86th overall with 
a time of 25:44.
Behind Harvey, sophomore 
Dario Donatelli (25:58) and 
junior Breck Fresen (25:59) 
both had personal best times, 
taking 111th and 115th over
all, respectively.
Fifth-year Geoff Misek placed 
140th overall with a time of 
26:11 while first-year J.P. Allera 
had a strong race, finishing 147th 
overall with a time of 26:13. Se
nior Mark Tressler (26:26) and 
junior Ryan Anderson (26:31) 
finished 167th and 178th overall, 
respectively.
We all could have [run] much 
faster. Even though we didnt 
run all that well, we at least had 
the chance to run in a big meet 
that gave the freshmen a taste of 
what nationals is like, Anderson 
said.
In the junior varsity race, first' year Justin Kurp had an impres
sive day, finishing 48th overall 
with a time of 26:41. First-year 
Josh Eickmeir also had a strong 
performance, placing 86th over
all with a time of 27:06. Junior 
Mike Condon crossed the finish 
line with a time of 27:18 to finish 
103rd overall.
On the womens team, junior 
Carolyn Clayton led the team 
and finished 71st overall with a 
time of 24:42. First-year Rebecca 
Hachey placed 85th overall with 
a time of 24:56.
Sophomore Anna Lenhart

Speaking volumes Everything you need to know
School of Art lecturers push the envelope with their work About religious friends and competitive lovers
This week, the School of Art Lecture Series featured 
three artists pushing the barriers of the artistic world.
Kevin and Jennifer McCoy: As lifetime partners 
and collaborators, husband and wife Kevin and 
Jennifer McCoy have established an intimate body of 
work that speaks of both as personal entities, as well 
as a combined artistic force. "We like art that has a 
joke in it, and we like to breathe art into that joke, 
said Kevin, who spoke Sept. 24. The artists work 
primarily in video, performance, and installation, 
using elements of sculpture in many of their pieces.
Overall, their work has undergone an evolutionary 
process, moving from a level of viewer-controlled 
interactivity to a more controlled atmosphere, delving 
into the artists personal experiences. Their earliest 
works deal with the breakdown and re-ordering of 
different nostalgic visual aesthetics. For example, Every Shot/Every Episode is a video cataloging every 
scene from Starsky and Hutch episodes into different 
categories. As an interactive work, the viewer has 
the ability to see every zoom, every car chase, or even 
every erection in the history of the show.
The artists created several similar pieces before 
their style evolved from interactive to automatically 
controlled works. In Horror Chase, Kevin and Jennifer 
rebuilt a movie set (on a miniaturized scale) to a 
scene from Evil Dead E, and re-filmed the entire scene 
several times, each of which included a different 
performance and frame rate. The work itself is a video 
of the performance, constantly edited in real time by 
the projecting video equipment to cause a neverending variation of the chase. Such a video speaks 
about the subtle variations of film while providing a 
humorous and engaging look at a cinematic clich.
From there, Kevin and Jennifer's work shifted toward 
the artists own personal experiences with cinema, 
using miniature sets of actual films to represent 
memories. In the Cardiac Ward represents the time 
the two of them spent in a hospital while watching American Graffiti. The video cuts from scenes of 
the miniature set to those of the hospital room. The 
piece highlights media's potential to be a personal 
experience, demonstrating how actual memories and 
moments in film can be linked with emotion.
From there, Kevin and Jennifers focus shifted once 
again to a more personal take on set reproduction. 
Creating upright sculptural shapes with two facets, 
one representing each individual, Double Fantasy 
deals with each of the artists childhood fascinations 
and dreams. The video captures these moments 
through close-up projections of the sculptural work.
Even more recently, the artists work has begun 
to deal with language as a personal association, 
creating different imagery for words in works such as Scary Things, the couples latest work. Scary Things 
delves into a number of different concepts, all dealing 
with media and the humor behind the individuals 
experience with it. Through the use of ready-made 
objects, Kevin and Jennifer McCoys sculptural works 
speak on a whole as communal, accessible objects 
that relate specifically to them as individuals. In many 
ways, their artwork also poses questions about the 
viewers personal and aesthetic experiences.
Mona Hatoum: Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum 
spoke on campus last Friday, appearing as annual 
guest for the Robert Lepper Distinguished Lecture 
in Creative Enquiry. Originally a performance artist, 
Hatoum now works though sculpture and installation. 
Her pieces are socially and politically charged, and 
her work has an inviting playfulness with dark and 
cryptic undertones. Overall, Hatoums art employs 
the body as a metaphor for society, questioning 
the barriers that surround it and the institutional 
structures within it. ,
To illustrate the concepts of containment and 
barriers, Hatoum has created a number of 
installations that cause the viewer to be both 
intoxicated and enchanted by the space, as well 
as repulsed and frightened. One of these pieces is Current Disturbance, a site-specific installation in the 
shape of a large cube. The work is made of rows and 
stacks of wire cages, each containing a light bulb.
The lights glow and dim, and the currents noise 
is amplified. The space itself is inviting, yet it also 
becomes a frightening experience; the claustrophobic 
effect of the sound parallels the rigidity of the cages 
to mimic institutional oppression.
Other works deal with the same concept, such as Life Sentence, a work constructed of wire lockers. Hatoum 
built in a moving light behind the work to enhance 
its cage-like structure. The silhouetted lockers move 
with the lights, engaging the viewer, but the coldness 
of the wire pushes back, connoting dehumanization 
and entrapment. Another theme pervading 
Hatoums work is the idea of the home as the sight 
of the familiar turning frightening. Homebound 
"features a domestic scene where all .the furniture 
and appliances have been turned into threatening 
objects. It is a caged space, where all of the objects 
have been electrically charged, creating a glowing 
desertion of what was once a place of comfort. As 
stated by Hatoum, her art illustrates "the domestic 
turned demonic." Likewise, Hatoums Grater Divide is 
a free-standing wall shaped like a giant cheese grater. 
Threatening and sharp, the implication is that it 
could physically shred a human body. The pairing of 
these two household objects creates both a familiarity 
and a fear of the works purpose.
Hatoums work provides the viewer with a push and 
pull narrative. Marbles Carpet (literally a carpet made 
of glass marbles) has an intentionally dangerous 
element, although the actual installation is seductive 
and visually pleasing. Likewise, another work from 
afar looks like a velvety welcome mat, but upon close 
examination, it is actually hundreds of sharp steel  
pins. This provides a certain dark humor to the work 
itself, playing on the viewers sentiments and making 
the pieces mentally accessible, and yet physically 
impossible to associate with.
Mona Hatoum's work plays on both sides of the 
viewer's emotions. There is an engaging and 
romantic element to her pieces, combated by a 
repulsive violence. She successfully establishes 
pieces that make a powerful and dark statement 
while still remaining beautiful.

Dear Myrtle,
Im very worried about one of my 
friends. She just wont accept

always says no. Ive even given 
her some excellent books, but 
she never even reads them. 
Shes such a sweet person, and I 
just cant bear the idea that shes 
going to Hell! What can I do?
Loving, Anxious Soul-Saver
LASS, sweetheart,
Jesus is not a vaccination. You 
can't force someone to believe 
something, no matter how much 
you want to. Inviting your friend to 
be part of something you believe in 
and find fulfilling is great  but do 
it once and then quit. By persisting 
,youre* only making your friend 
uncomfortable and upset  your 
tactics are probably' actually driving 
her away from your beliefs and 
everything they represent. She's 
probably quite happy with her 
beliefs. Are you entirely happy with 
yours? Do you really want to believe 
in a God that would send such a 
sweet person as your friend to fiery 
torment? Think about it. Cut down 
on the missionary stuff and just be a 
good friend, LASS.

PSO begins 2007-2008 season
Toradze and Tortelier give the Big Five a run for their money
Heinz Hall sparkled Friday night, and it wasn't just the 
chandeliers. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra opened^ 
their season with class: an all-American overture, a celebrated 
soloist, and a classical blockbuster.
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) has consistently 
been esteemed as a world-class orchestra in recent years, on 
par with the old "Big Five American orchestras of New York, 
Cleveland, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Under the 
baton of Yan Pascal Tortelier on opening weekend, the PSO 
opening program did not disappoint.
John Corigliano's Promenade Overture started the night. Best 
known for his emotional film score The Red Violin, Corigliano 
took a drastically different step in this comical and delightful 
piece. With only percussionists onstage at the beginning 
and various musicians gliding, hopping, or marching as the 
piece progressed, instruments in tow, there was certainly an 
air of amusement felt by both the audience and the players. 
The theatrics allowed audiences to see PSO musicians in 
a different light, but the players never lost sight of musical 
integrity, pulling the overture off in a bold and undeniably 
American style.
Russian pianist Alexander Toradzes rendition of 
Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto no. 1 was unique and 
heartfelt. A world-renowned soloist, chamber musician, and 
pedagogue, Toradze displayed his multifaceted talents by 
performing Tchaikovskys popular work. The first movement
was stirring, with the orchestra's famous opening line 
followed by piano chords that sounded almost noble. The 
orchestra played majestically without overpowering the 
soloist, while echoing the melody of the piano convincingly. 
During this movement, Toradze became so enveloped in 
the passion of the music that he even conducted for a bit.
The second movement was equally filled with quiet energy; 
all of the orchestral solos were very melodic in line and 
complemented the sentiments of the piano. The pianist 
and the orchestra handled the third movement masterfully, 
encompassing its dancelike themes and technicalities. 
Toradze did a fine job of acknowledging the folkloric themes of 
Tchaikovskys work as well as its virtuosic aspects: He played 
very close to the piano, lending an introspective element 
to his playing, and yet demonstrating virtuosic grandeur at 
times.
In all, it was a wonderful performance, with Maestro Tortelier 
turning around to the audience a brief second before the 
end of the concerto, as if to bring the listeners into the 
conclusion's raw energy. When Tortelier jumped and raised 
his arms in triumph upon ending the.concerto, Toradze stood 
from his piano bench, and shook Torteliers hand in collective 
celebration.
Hector Berlioz's dramatic yet charming Symphonie 
Fantastique closed the program. The PSO did both parts 
of this piece justice: the light, fanciful dances and the 
dark, climatic moments. One could almost feel fate driving
this fantastic piece to its end, reminiscent of the form of 
Tchaikovsky's later symphonies.
Overall, the PSO was polished and energetic on this 
impressive opening night. Tortelier has exhibited himself as 
a genius at emoting the music with gestures that suitably 
articulate the flow of the musical line. One can never 
underestimate the effect of a dramatic downbeat, colored by 
Torteliers punches, or the sweet sentimentality of a dance, 
reflected by his subtle swaying. The instrumentalists also 
contributed to the evening's success, presenting each solo 
with a seamless transition as well as performing the tutti 
passages (when all the instruments play together) with 
collective group energy.
The audience gave a lasting standing ovation, and the 
sentiment seemed to be reciprocated onstage, possibly 
foreshadowing the success of the 2007-2008 season. While 
the orchestra has worked hard to create an engaging season, 
the PSO administration has also been working to bring 
audiences to Heinz Hall to enjoy the gift of classical music. 
When it all comes together, it is almost magical. Perhaps 
concertmaster and Carnegie Mellon faculty member Andres 
Cardenes said it best: "[I enjoy] the responsibility and 
challenge of playing your best at all times, plus feeling the 
energy of an excited and engaged audience."

Artist Profile: Evan Penny
Artist brings sculptures to life
Walking into a room full of artist Evan Penny's sculptures 
is like walking into a room full of people. His lifelike, almost 
statuary figures seem ready to engage museum-goers in 
casual conversation.
From May 11 to September 2, the Columbus Museum of Art 
in Ohio hosted Penny's first United States solo exhibit. The 
display was a part of the museum's Currents series, which 
features work by international artists. Penny's work has 
already been exhibited internationally in museums such as 
the Galeria Fernando Latiorre in Spain.
Much of Pennys talent lies in his ability to capture the tiniest 
details of the human face and body in his sculptures. He often 
sculpts only the head, neck and shoulders, but everything 
from the contours of the sculpture's face to the hairs on its 
head appear authentic.
Yet in his latest work, the sizes and dimensions of the 
sculptures are extraordinary. The pieces are profoundly larger 
than their human inspirations and are usually tilted, stretched 
or distorted in some other fashion.
The series, called Stretch, is named after the command in 
Adobe Photoshop. Such distortions abandon traditional 
spatial logic and embrace the logic of virtual space now made 
possible by the computer," writes Joe Houston, the associate
curator of Contemporary Art at the Columbus Museum of Art, 
when explaining Penny's inspiration for one such series of 
sculptures in the exhibit brochure.
Penny combines lifelike features and added distortion to 
reveal a major theme in his work: the union of reality and
The most refreshing aspect of 
Pennys work is his 
acceptance of physical flaws.
perception. He also conveys this theme through the sizes 
of his sculptures. Several of Penny's works in his No One in Particular series resemble everyday people, only they have 
much larger proportions.
Another enlarged sculpture is L. Faux: Colour 2 (Libby). 
According to Houston, the subject for this particular sculpture 
was Pennys friend Libby Faux, and the sculpture of her head 
and shoulders is five times larger than in real life. With a head 
of bushy brown hair and two wide, hazel eyes, the startling 
size of the sculpture only further emphasizes its authenticity.
Penny retains the lifelike qualities of his sculptures through 
several steps in his process. According to the brochure, Penny 
first uses clay to form a mold for the sculpture. He then layers 
pigmented silicone and fiberglass in the mold. These layers 
form the future sculpture. To add ordinary, realistic features, 
he uses natural hairs for head, facial and body hair.
The most refreshing aspect of Pennys work is his acceptance 
of physical flaws. Whether modeled after an actual person 
or a figment of his imagination, Penny's sculptures ignore 
societys current quest for perfection and depict ordinary 
people. His figures have wrinkles, age spots and freckles; he 
sculpts both men and women, and the young and the old.
Aside from creating his own sculptures, Penny has also 
passed on his knowledge to other aspiring artists. He has 
taught at the Toronto School of Art, Ontario College of Art, 
and other colleges and art institutes.
Although Pennys exhibit will not be coming to Pittsburgh in 
the near future, his United States solo exhibit is currently at 
the Flint Institute of Arts, Michigan through October 28.

Mark Ronson remakes magic and Iron and Wine goes crazyio stationOn Music and Nerds
Mark Ronson, Version
In the midst of illustrious hip-hop producers with 
elaborate, hard-hitting beats, theres Mark Ronson, 
often only accompanied by his guitar or his turntables, 
instead of hype men and machine-made beats. And 
with his second album, a compilation of covers aptly 
named Version, theres no mistaking him for Timbaland 
or Kanye.
Ronson, who has worked with artists ranging from 
Ghostface Killah to Lily Allen, was until recently known 
only as a hip-hop DJ, scratching at parties thrown by 
the hip-hop elite (think Diddy and friends), and even 
producing a collection of songs for his first album, Here 
Comes the Fuzz. But where as Fuzz features vocal 
collaborations from rappers like Mos Def and Freeway, 
Version features the bluesy vocals of Amy Winehouse 
and the rock-pop influence of Phantom Planet. Mark 
Ronsons transition from hip-hop to other genres is 
mostly effortless, obvious in the way he recreates each 
song for its featured artist: Amy Winehouses Valerie 
(originally performed by The Zutons) is soul and blues; 
Lily Allens "Oh My God" (Kaiser Chiefs) is Brit pop; and 
Daniel Merriweathers.Stop Me," (The Smiths) is a little 
R&B.
All of the tracks are complimented by Ronson's 
trademark  blaring horns sounding over breaks and 
under choruses, which Ronson somehow makes fit.
No song on Version completely disappoints, and the 
standouts are surprisingly refreshing. The mediocre bits 
are mediocre at the fault of the vocalists  Ronson's 
work, on the other hand, never fails.
Version comes as a refreshing take on modern music 
among the stale reused and remanufactured beats 
that are now scattered about on the music scene. His 
curiosity and venture away from hip-hop music has 
done Ronson some good; he seamlessly blends the old 
with the new, modernizing songs from the last 20 years, 
many of which come from the last decade.
Remaking songs has probably never sounded so 
amazing.
had established as his overall style. Perhaps you can 
see where this is going. After recording an EP in 2005 
with the notoriously eclectic and experimental group 
Calexico, Iron and Wine released The Shepherd's Dog, 
revealing Beams desire to move on to bigger things.
Beam would have trouble squeezing the vast number 
of instruments heard on The Shepherd's Dog into his 
old bedroom. Throughout the album, superfluous and 
unconventional noises keep popping up unexpectedly: 
Hammond organs, vibraphones, backward tracks, 
harmonicas, sitars, etc. At other times, these sounds 
also peek their heads amid a flurry of layered, distorted 
guitar tracks and intrusive percussion beats. But Beam's 
decision to include such variegated instrumentation 
stems more from curiosity than ostentation: Hes more 
like the guy at a party who just wants to try all of the 
appetizers than the chef who shows off all hes created. 
Sometimes Beams the guy eating the always-delicious 
mini hot dogs; other times hes finishing up an 
unappetizing kebab and trying to figure out where he 
will set down the leftover skewer.
Yet, as with all pop music, what really matters is the core 
of the songs themselves. And on The Shepherd's Dog, 
we have a wide range in terms of actual song quality.
In the glistening guitar picking that opens Carousel, 
the notes feel like tiny droplets of rain dripping down . 
from the sky and melting into each other, an effect that 
warms and satiates. This song is gorgeous, an instant 
classic. Then you have songs like Flightless Bird, 
American Mouth, the albums final track. If you cant 
infer from the title how nauseating this song is, maybe 
this will capture its atrociousness: Beginning with a trite 
and predictable melody, "Flightless Bird has lines like 
fat house cat, I cut my long baby hair, and Blood of 
Christ mountain stream  what could possibly even be 
the subject of this song?  all of which Beam sings with 
a sense of incomparable eyes-closed, slow head-nodding 
smugness. And again, in terms of quality, there are 
plenty of tracks in between these two extremes.
With The Shepherd's Dog, Iron and Wine has chosen to 
dance across the spectrum of pop music. If this dance 
doesnt always look so good, so be it. -
London is electronic music. Jungle, dubstep, IDM, electrnica, glitch, ambient, 
and (sadly) trance all had roots in the United Kingdoms capital city. While 
these genres may catalyze a spectrum of thoughts (between falling asleep and 
dancing for 15 solid hours, then waking up in a hospital bed wondering what 
happened to your missing wallet), they all have one thing in common: The 
music is created by nerds.
Mentally place yourself in Brooklyn, New York  quite possibly the epicenter 
of the scenester universe. Everyone in your cone of vision is wearing jeans that 
grab so much crotch, there is literally no chance of future procreation. Odds 
are you will bump into a self-proclaimed visionary artist or poet, whose work 
is more amateurish than the garbage you turned out during an unnecessarily 
emotional high school breakup. (As a side-note, theyre probably drinking Red 
Stripe.) Youre standing in line at Studio B  one of the newer clubs set in the 
middle of a warehouse district. While a little shaky about the prospect of getting 
mugged, the shocking plethora of free parking manages to overshadow your 
nervousness. Youre there to see Simian Mobile Disco: a British electro-dance 
production duo from the coastal town of Bristol. From what youve heard, 
you've painted a picture in your head of a pair of waifs, dressed in a Frankie 
Says Relax T-shirt paired with the aforementioned size-zero womens jeans.
But when the band hits the stage, you find you were completely wrong. 
These two gentlemen are no trendier than your run-of-the-mill Linux-running, 
occasionally showering, Carnegie Mellon computer science major. Huge 
white-guy afro, Nirvana-era ripped jeans, and middle-aged physique. They 
dont mix with turntables and they have presumably never touched a traditional 
instrument. They use laptops, beat samplers, and patch bays (basically, panels 
full of circuits).
Somehow, unbeknown to me, such equipment combined with the direction of 
two nerdy dudes produced some of the most dance-able music I've heard to 
date ironic, considering neither member of the duo could dance to save their 
lives. The show is mesmerizing  a veritable mindfuck of light and sound.
The topical music genre, which I colloquially address as Nerd Dance, has 
been on the rise over the past few years. Rewind to Pittsburgh last summer: 
Girl Talk, a 26-year-old biomedical engineering graduate from Case Western 
Reserve, was published in the College Music Journal and Roiling Stone, both of 
which had a musically induced orgasm overhis first major release Night Ripper. 
Gregg Gillis (Girl Talks human name) mastered the art of mash-up dance, 
somehow successfully mixing Ying Yang Twins with Elton John. That being 
said, Gillis is just shy of 6'3, has an extremely pronounced Adams apple, and 
sports a dance routine which ultimately resembles an epileptic giraffe. A nerd.
Consider this a call to arms for music-loving dorks everywhere  your era is 
now. Groups like Daft Punk, Alan Braxe and Friends, Justice, and Digitalism 
are all rocking sold-out shows and packed nightclubs. Grab your computers, 
circuitry toolkits, and an 808 and perhaps someday, you could be the next 
Simian Mobile Disco or Girl Talk.

Iron and Wine, The Shepherd's Dog
Samuel Beam, also known as Iron and Wine, has 
continued the trend among indie musicians of 
increasing instrumentation and production with every 
passing album  see Elliott Smith and The Flaming Lips 
for more examples of this progression. To be sure, this 
path is never completely linear, though it always seems 
to go from point A to point B, sometimes regressing 
a little toward the end. Iron and Wines first album,
2002s The Creek Drank the Cradle, was a collection of 
lo-fi tracks that Beam recorded in his bedroom, rarely 
featuring more than a guitar, banjo, and the haunting 
voice of a disturbed Southerner. He sent a demo tape 
to a record label, and they released it as a full-length 
album. Iron and Wine's second record, Our Endless 
Numbered Days (2004), though professionally recorded, 
stayed true to the stark and vulnerable sound that Beam

Aftertaste
Walnut Grill
A long day in Shadyside is sure to work up an appetite. 
After falling into the Gap, discovering Victorias Secret, 
and Americanizing your Apparel, the Walnut Grill 
may be exactly what you need. Located on Walnut 
and Bellefonte streets, smack-dab in consumerism 
central, .the Walnut Grill offers affordable, delicious 
food in a chic environment. Plus, its roomy enough 
to a hold a days worth of shopping bags with enough 
space left over for waiters to get by.
Visible from the street, Walnut Grills stylish 
hanging banners connote a contemporary, upscale 
environment, and the inside upholds this expectation. 
The restaurant offers a cheerful view from the second 
story of its building, just a floor above Shady Grove, 
the restaurants casual counterpart and bar. Metallic 
sculptures of trees and chandeliers with lights shaped 
like leaves create a charming, outdoorsy environment
 no flyswatter required. There are several spacious
booths, as well as a few large circular booths, that 
look cozy enough to make you want to grab your 
eight best friends and take them out to dinner. On 
top of that, theres enough interesting art on the walls 
to fill the lull in conversation between appetizer and 
entre. ^
And youll want both an appetizer and an entre. 
The food is healthy and upscale enough to impress 
your parents, but also cheap enough to satisfy 
your friends. Overall, the menu is loaded with 
delicious-yet-nutritious items like sun-dried tomatoes, 
portabella mushrooms, red pepper hummus, and 
avocado, but meat-lovers need not fear: The menu 
includes a $25 filet mingon, a $19 10-ounce sirloin, 
an $8 8-ounce Angus burger, as well as a host of 
other delectables catering to carnivores. For those of 
us in the middle, there are plenty of chicken dishes, 
plus a refreshing selection of seafood that may well 
curb a craving for a Showcase Salads crab salad.
Appetizers are $5 to $12, ranging from French 
onion soup (the menu advertises it as "bubbling with 
provolone) to bruschett to seared ahi tuna. Entres, 
pasta included, are $12 to $23, and each comes 
with a salad and two side dishes (French fries, mixed 
vegetables, mashed potatoes, wild rice, or ratatouille
 for those of us Pixar fans). For something lighter 
on your stomach and wallet, the sandwiches, wraps, 
and burgers are only $7 to $10 and each comes with 
a side. Starting at $5, salads are likewise intriguing, 
and the Red Roquefort salad, if you dont get to it 
the first time, may warrant a second visit. A list of 17 
mouth-watering martinis may have those of us under
21 cursing the fact were not in Canada, and the list 
of standard (although scrumptious) desserts may 
have to do instead.
Walnut Grill is open seven days a week with a lighter 
lunch menu and brunch on Sundays. With such 
reasonable prices, you should have enough left over 
to shop until you drop  or at least until youre ready 
for dessert.

Breaking into Hollywood
Young alums crop up on the small screen
Is there such a thing as breaking into Hollywood? The 
answer depends on who you talk to. Some actors recall in 
autobiographies the one lucky audition after so many rejections. 
Others remember struggles to buy groceries and detours into 
less attractive professions to pay the bills.
But what does it mean to break in? Some argue there is no such 
thing, like screenwriter John August, the writer of Big Fish 
and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
as well as writer-director of 
upcoming Ryan Reynolds 
vehicle The Nines. On his 
blog, johnaugust. com, August 
wrote, There's no systematic 
effort to keep newcomers out 
of Hollywood.
August may be right; take a 
look at some of this years 
acting graduates: Michele ?
Wong, who will guest star later 
this year on ER; Rich Dreher, 
a supporting cast member on 
ABCs new series Cashmere 
Maa\ and Abby MacFarlane, 
who has a role on the new NBC 
series Journeyman.

the writers room that characters Joey and Pacey kiss  despite 
the show's assertion for its first two seasons that Joey and 
Dawson were soul mates.
Eventually, the shows writers decided that the kiss would save 
the show from falling ratings, in addition to reinvigorating the 
increasingly disinterested cast. The kiss did.both, and kept 
Dawsons on the air for four additional seasons.
August noted on his blog that in lesser-known 
Hollywood fields, like lighting, there is a clear career 
path, approximating the apprenticeship of old-tyme 
trades, but admitted it may not be as easy as it 
is "comfortably predictable. Actors, writers, 
and directors do not have a path so welldefined, and must scout for opportunities.
But he still denies a breaking in process, 
because there is no obstacle meant to keep 
anyone out. There are just obstacles to make 
the process more difficult.
Carnegie Mellon grads are succeeding. In 
addition to the three members of the class '07, 
there are alumni on new series including Saving 
Grace, Chuck, Back to You, and Mad Men, as well 
as returning shows like NCIS, It's Always Sunny in 
Philadelphia, Heroes, and Law and Order: SVU.
Many writers are just as lucky. Becoming a writer on television 
may be as easy as sending in a spec script, as shown by alum 
(MFA '88, playwriting) Jeffrey Stepakoffs memoir Billion Dollar Kiss: The Kiss That Saved Dawson's Creek and Other Adventures in TV Writing. For a spec script, writers pick a television show 
similar to what they would like to work on, and create a script 
that, ideally, feels like a regular episode. The goal of a spec script 
is to make it clear you understand the basic dynamics of a show 
without alienating those who already write for it.
Stepakoffs spec script landed him an agent, who then wrangled 
him into several TV shows before he became a writer, and then 
co-executive producer otDawson's Creek. The billion dollar 
kiss" -of his memoirs title comes from a divisive suggestion in
However, as with any field, certain jobs come in and out of 
vogue. At the time Stepakoff entered Hollwood in the late 80s, 
writing was booming as many professionals in other fields drifted 
in, attracted to writing  screenwriters legendarily earned 
millions for scripts with proposals that were just sentences long. 
Several years later, actors pulled in the biggest paychecks 
after yielding the biggest box office grosses, a trend that still 
continues with actors like Will Smith earning $20 million a movie. 
Still, its anyones guess which film occupation will be the next to 
earn big money. No matter what happens, you can bet there will 
be new faces in the midst of it, making their careers.

New show premiers Wednesday, Oct. 3 at 8 p.m. on ABC

Created by Bryan Fuller, who also developed the one-season Wonderfalls, Pushing Daisies follows the quirky, whimsical, 
candy-colored, star-crossed love story of Ned (Lee Pace). As a 
child, Ned discovers he has the gift to bring the dead back to life 
with one touch. At the sudden death of his mother, Ned touches 
her to revive her. Unfortunately, Ned does not yet grasp that, if the 
dead are brought back to life for longer_than a minute, someone 
else must die in their place  and so the father of the girl next 
door (whose name is Charlotte but goes by Chuck) dies instead. 
At this time, Ned also does not yet understand a second touch to 
the once-dead kills them again, and so a goodnight kiss offs his 
mother permanently.
The pilot (leaked online for months) follows Neds life as an adult. 
He makes pies and keeps a murder-solving business on the side 
with friend and former cop, Emerson (Chi McBride). They wake 
the dead, ask who murdered them, return them to death, and 
collect the reward. To his surprise, Ned learns that the latest
big-reward murder victim is Chuck (Anna Friel), whom he hasnt 
seen since the funerals of their parents, which was also the site of 
their first and last kiss. He visits her, but, unable to return her to 
death, he keeps her alive  knowing they can never touch again, 
even as romance blossoms.
The pilot almost looks like a film by Wes Anderson, or Tim 
Burton's Big Fish. The sets of Daisies are highly stylized, and 
the frothy color contrasts with the sometimes stoic delivery of 
Pace, little-known to most viewers. But viewers can easily fall in 
love with Ned.and Chuck, and the romantic aspect is rivaled by 
the comedy. McBride and Pace have an easy chemistry, and the 
dialogue between them snaps. Dont make the mistake of tuning 
in to the all-hype Kid Nation on CBS or NBC's sophomoric Deal or No Deal; Pushing Daisies is one to watch.

Revolving around Danielewski
The motivation, the process, the technology, the writer
Mark Z. Danielewski, best known for his debut novel House of 
Leaves, came to Pittsburgh last week to promote his newest 
work, Only Revolutions. Appearing at Joseph-Beth Booksellers 
for a reading, discussion, and signing, Danielewski fielded 
questions, mostly on why he became a writer.
After reading a few short sections of his work, concluding 
with the very end of Only Revolutions (an action he told the 
audience tgat publishers ask their authors never to perform), 
he asked for questions from the diverse crowd. Composed 
of many teenagers and a few older couples  a mixture of 
hipster, post-goth, and more clean-cut styles  the crowd 
that had spilled over its allotted area, filled every chair, and 
stretched into the aisles.
The questions came quickly, touching on a variety of topics 
including Danielewski's promotion of other authors' works 
and the experience of touring. One audience member even 
asked him about an earlier appearance where he was said 
to have lost his temper, but he seemed not to remember the 
incident.
However, most of the questions gravitated toward the process 
of being a-writer and the impact his own writings have 
had. When Danielewski was asked to concisely describe 
House of Leaves, he responded: "I just tell them it is a story 
about a family who moves into a house that is bigger on the 
inside than the outside." This description, while vastly over 
simplified, does put forth the main premise behind House of 
Leaves, which, after 32 rejections, was published by Pantheon 
Books in March 2000 and almost immediately became a cult 
classic. To elaborate, House of Leaves is a book about a book 
about a movie about a house (none of which exist) with an 
inside larger than it should be.
One audience member in particular was having a hard time
coping with the mechanistic qualities of Only Revolutions. 
This is a book that has exactly 360 pages-, with exactly 360 
words and 36 lines on each page. Each side of the book is the 
front: Reading in one direction, you are told the story of Sam; 
from the other, the story of Hailey. At the same time, as you 
read these two stories, you are presented with a timeline that 
runs along the center margin of each page, displaying events 
from history.
Only Revolutions is the story of young lovers Sam and Hailey 
who have broken free from the grip of time and are forever 
16 years old. As their stories are told separately in the book, 
you cannot read them together, and a publishers note at the 
beginning recommends reading eight pages of one and then 
eight pages of another, flipping until the story is complete.
Danielewski responded to the question by answering that 
Hailey and Sam are trying to get free from everything, trying 
to escape history. Part of the experience for him as an author 
involved, in his words, tying them up and watching them 
get loose of it all." For Danielewski, the process resulted in a 
highly structured book.
But he added that, for both House of Leaves and Only 
Revolutions, the structure, the playful typography, the colored 
words, the format of the page, is always derived from the 
story he wants to tell. Throughout House of Leaves, the word 
house is always written in blue ink, a method expanded to 
Only Revolutions, where the letter o" is printed in yellow or 
green, for Haileys and Sams stories, respectively.
To support such thinking, Danielewski told a story from when 
he was 10 years old, a writer even at that time. He said, I 
guess there was a time I wanted to be an astronaut, and then 
an inventor, but I was always drawn to paper and pencil. We 
were moving around, it wasn't glamorous ... but I remember
always having a pencil and paper, and that was my world, 
and it had stability. He maintains that to this day he always 
starts with pencil and paper, only later using computers to 
implement the structures of his stories.
Discussion later turned to the scholarship his novels have 
inspired. Danielewski claims to have expected much of it, 
including references to Freud, Derrida, Joyce, and Borges.
A newwave of criticism, however, moves past what he had 
anticipated; it comes from technologists, including critic 
Katherine Hayles, who uses House of Leaves to highlight how 
our lives (and writings) have been influenced by computers, 
the Internet, and databases.
Danielewski claims he is quite a slow writer: 10 years for the 
first novel, six for the second. When he began the reading, he 
had to ask for someone to lend him a copy of House of Leaves 
because he wanted to read a short section from it, a section 
that he found immediately in the 700-page book. Though 
' musicians sometimes forget lyrics to their art-topping songs 
at concerts, he didnt miss a word in the poetic and stylized 
sections of Only Revolutions that he read.
It is understandable that the insights that people take from 
his novels do not surprise him. It is clear he plans and is 
deeply in tune with the books he has written. Throughout 
the discussion, he conveyed himself as a researcher and an 
author; he is educated and eloquent, and you can understand 
how this man created his stories. Because for Danielewski it 
is really about the work, the writing. I really love to write," 
he said. "It is what I do."

its written by Quentin Tarantino, so 
you know a ridiculous time is waiting

on the way murders and murderers 
are glamorized in the media. 
Admittedly, the message is a little 
obsolete, because in 2007 the only

STORY AND PHOTOS BY
Molly McCurdy | Junior Staffwriter
ASA WATTEN CHRISTIE IBARAKI B

---------------------------------------------------

BAILEY GRATTAN
Pittsburgh is no Milan, no Paris, no New York. We are 
sometimes classified as the blue-collar, steel-mining, artless 
crowd. But Carnegie Mellon's campus is not devoid of 
stylish coeds. The view from the Cut is quite aesthetically 
pleasing  just look closer. Leaves are changing colors and 
weve got people ringing in the new season with their backto-school threads.
This fall, styles hit the fashion world with a lot of pret-aporter (ready-to-wear) concepts. Silhouettes tapered as the 
preferred form became simple and tailored. The angular 
sculpture of Miuccia Prada's skirts and the inorganic 
origami-like shapes of Stefano Pilatis jackets at Yves 
Saint Laurent are perfect examples. These styles are full of 
straight lines that define the human body rather than hiding 
its shape. Fashion has leaned away from the Mary-Kate and 
Ashley dumpster layers and mish-mashed accessories. For 
the last few seasons, the womens form has been similarly 
swamped, engulfed by huge amounts of fabrics. But the 
baby doll, bubble, trapeze, and tent have made way for the 
sleek, long lines exemplified by Jil Sander suits and the lean 
A-line of Marc Jacobs coats. Simple cuts like the A-line 
flatten every figure by enhancing the waistline and hiding 
what youre self-conscious about. Male fashion has also 
slimmed down; pants are narrower with hems hitting just 
above the ankle  a style reminiscent of the 40s or a swing 
band's relaxed class.
And Carnegie Mellon students haven't escaped the 
influence of notorious Cory Kennedy, a blogger famous for 
writing about her "fabulous life" and posting photos of her 
friends and herself that make for online eye candy. Her 
hipster and ironically clashing style mixes hip-hop sneaker
n
culture with a vintage twist.
Bevin Hill, a senior voice major, also has that hipster college 
look. She blends together Corys clashing threads with 
a more sophisticated color scheme that adds a mature 
taste. Hipster staples include patterned scarves worn 
like bandannas and comically awkward sunglasses that 
somehow manage to perfectly frame the face. Hills scarf 
resembles Consuelo Castiglioni's taste in artsy textiles 
matched with nudes and monochromatic non-colors. This 
seasons pinnacle accessory is the big bag, and Hills 
white tote is a perfect catch.
Another popular item on campus is the biker bag. Asa 
Watten, a senior social and decision science major and fine 
art minor, exemplifies the Pittsburgh biker scene. His pants 
are a perfect no-nonsense slim fit, and he sports a classic 
shoulder bag. You can customize a recycled plastic bag 
online at www.timbuk2.com  they're environmentally 
friendly and are possibly the second-hottest biker accessory, 
next to the self-built road bike.
As Carnegie Mellon is in an urban environment, its no 
surprise that the hip-hop culture has become a big part of 
our campus identity. Comfy and loud sneakers like those 
on Christie Ibaraki, a first-year H&SS student, are certainly 
popular. Ibaraki and Hill took a note from Jil Sanders's fall 
collection: muted tones and non-colors that help elongate 
the form. First-year art major Blair Spo'tswood Dowd is also 
sporting the grungy, urban look. Her muted palate really 
brings out the fun pattern in her jeans.
This season's collections also feature Japanese influences
with deconstructed tailoring. Japanese fashion houses are 
famous for their sleek simplicity; the no-frills sophisticated 
look can be found on campus, too. Androgynous shapes 
are quite popular  mens clothes get tighter and womens 
slacks a bit more tailored. CFA graduate Elizabeth Monoian 
('00) was spotted in Skibo in an outfit both androgynous and 
sleek. Her style harks back to Comme Des Gaiqons in the 
early '80s. Fall styles have a distinctly sharper, longer line 
that looks adult and sophisticated.
Of course, its impossible to forget this seasons most 
exciting silhouette, change: the return of high-waisted 
pants. The nipped waistline became popular with Christian 
Dior's 1947 line. It was because women longed to look like 
women again that they adopted the New Look," Dior said, 
as quoted in a 1947 issue of Vogue.
Bailey Grattan, a sophomore political science major, has 
the perfect form for the ever-popular high-waisted jeans.
Her pants are perfectly tapered at the ankle and.paired 
with a masculine polo, creating a great X shape, which 
emphasizes the shoulders and hips while cinching the 
waist. The jeans make me feel like Im ready for whatever 
comes at me  a 'dress for success school event or just a 
night out, Grattan said. Junior CS major Dominic Dagradi 
was also wearing a "dress for success suit to class. He 
pulled his outfit together with a whimsical punk belt that 
helped tone down the ensemble.
As New York magazine advised, The best thing to do 
in a suit is to take yourself less seriously." While fashion 
becomes more casual and less serious, just remember that 
the right clothes open all doors.

When dating meets dancing
Someplace, not here brings rhythm to the bar scene
Attack Theatre captures the world of 
romance and chance encounters in its 
newest production, Someplace, not 
here. The fast-paced, provocative dance 
show opened last weekend in Bloomfield 
and runs through Friday.
"It starts with the end of an evening 
at a bar, said Peter Kope, co-director 
and co-choreographer of the piece, as 
well as one of the five dancers. [After 
that] there is a flashback from earlier 
that day of three people preparing to 
go out. Theyve all been trying to find 
different ways to connect with people, 
arid they find that they received the 
same message." Obeying the message, 
all of the dancers end up at the A-Bar 
wearing green scarves, adding an 
element of confusion conveyed through 
the expressive choreography.
Through dance, the characters show 
not only their excitement about meeting 
someone new, but also jealousy and 
frustration, not to mention inebriation
 they are at a bar, arent they? The
choreography is spectacular. Dancers 
are constantly weaving in and out of one 
another, wrapping their legs and arms 
around the other characters to convey 
sexuality and attraction. The performers 
also made use of the green scarves, 
wrapping them around each others 
waists, pulling each other close and 
propelling each other to the other side of 
the stage.
Accompanying the production was the 
Pittsburgh band Local Honey, whose 
lyrics, Kope said, "largely inspired the 
dance. As though they were truly 
out on a Saturday night, the dancers 
responded realistically to the music, 
clapping at the end of each song. At one 
point, lead singer Becky Corrigan even 
asked the fictional bartender (played 
by Patrick Jordan), Could I get a shot 
of Southern Comfort?" The live music 
helped reinforce t-he bar scene, and the 
mood even extended into the audience. 
Its unusual to see interpretive and jazz 
dance performed to country/rock songs, 
but it worked seamlessly.
Other elements used in the production, 
like a live video of the dancers projected 
onto a screen behind them, made the 
production modern and fresh. The script 
also contributed to this contemporary 
feeling by referencing new technologies 
like e-mail and text messages, which 
also added to the humor of the show 
(particularly in a choreographed number 
about spam).
Not only is Someplace, not here a 
fabulous example of dance theater, 
it also incorporates the feehngs of 
anticipation and curiosity familiar with 
meeting someone new for the first time. 
The choreography, paired with Local 
Honeys rock music, conveys these 
emotions in a fascinating way through 
the theatrical arts.

Lessons in lithography
Printmaking method turns chemistry into art
10
Dating back to the 18th century, 
lithography is a method of printmaking 
unique for its chemical properties. 
Essentially, it is the process of printing 
on stone (lithos is the Greek word 
for stone), though no design is ever 
engraved onto the stone.
"In'lithography, there is no physical 
change in the parts involved in 
printing, said Heather White, an 
associate printer at the North Side 
studio and gallery Artists Image 
Resource (AIR). "Lithography is based 
on chemical change. AIRs lithography 
workshop features resources for a 
variety of projects, including printing 
on paper screens and on the surfaces 
of rocks. Traditionally, artists engraved 
their images on limestone; most modern 
lithography uses aluminum plates. This 
way, we dont have to grind off the top 
of the limestone to make it smooth," 
White said.
Making a lithoprint
1. First make a design on the surface 
of the stone or plate using an oil-based 
medium. A variety of oil-based media 
can be used  the more oily the 
substance, the more it will repel water, 
and the better the final print will be.
2. The design has to be a negative of
the image that will be produced on 
the final print, so everything has to be 
drawn opposite of what is intended.
3. Coat the surface with an emulsion 
of acid and gum arabic. This creates a 
layer of salt around the image.
4. Wash the oil off using turpentine.
5. Remember to keep the surface wet 
with water throughout the process. 
Water is attracted to the salt layer 
around the image but doesnt creep into 
the image.
6. Apply an oil-based ink to the 
surface. Since the ink has oil and 
the original image had oil, the ink is 
attracted to the image and is repelled by 
the water around it.
7. Use just the right amount of ink.
Too much and [the ink] would collect 
outside the plate and you would lose 
edge definition," said William Rodgers, 
who heads the operations and workforce 
of AIR. Too little and it wont be a rich 
enough color.
8. Place the plate in the printing 
machine.
9. Put the paper on the plate and 
start the machine.The machine applies 
pressure on the paper, transferring the 
image from the plate onto the paper.'
Things get more difficult when there is 
more than one color in the picture. Each
color must be printed individually, 
so multiple colors require multiple runs 
on the machine. The hard part here is 
to precisely align the paper and plate
 artists usually fasten them together 
using pins. This way, the paper is in the 
same position each time the machine 
runs, and the lithoprint is not distorted.
History
Lithography was invented by Alois 
Senefelder in Bohemia in 1796. 
"Senefelder came up with lithography 
as a better way to print sheet music, 
.White said, "but the applications have 
since expanded." Lithography is now 
used for making things ranging from 
posters to maps, in addition to artwork. 
Numerous French and American 
artists, including Pablo Picasso, used 
lithography for printmaking around the 
turn of the 20th century, and lithography 
continues to be popular among artists.
AIR artists create a variety of lithoprints, 
ranging from prints made on plain 
paper to prints made on stone. Many 
of the pieces involve a combination 
of lithography and other printing 
techniques.

same stupid things 
\ over and over.
C.S. Lewis once said 
this:
Pain is Gods 
megaphone to a

if the whole world 
is deaf, however, 
of what use 
is a megaphone?
That is,

wouldnt hear 
anyway.Can you hear 
me now?

Members of the Singapore Students' Association dish out the grub 
at their 2007 Food Festival! Friday afternoon in the UC's Merson 
Courtyard. They served roti prata (fried pancakes with curry), nasi 
lemak (coconut rice), bak chor mee (noodles with minced pork), and 
plenty more authentic treats.
