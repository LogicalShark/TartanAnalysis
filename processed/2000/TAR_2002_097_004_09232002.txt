Hilary [Clinton] will be president [of 
the United States] or not. We will talk 
about the relationship between the

Activists call for more debate on Iraq agenda
by Sean Mintus
RNIssrAHNaA
In the shadows of two cannons and perched 
underneath an American flag, upwards of 150 
activists, mostly students, professionals, teach
ers, and artists gathered at Soldiers & Sailors 
Memorial Hall on Saturday to protest 
Americas military actions against Iraq.
Children played on stacks of cannonballs as 
dogs trotted merrily through the stretches of 
carefully tended grass. A stiff breeze bringing 
down cool air from the north slid through the 
masses, bending placards and testing resolve. 
Some spoke into the makeshift PA while others 
passed out flyers. A dozen or so stood on the 
Fifth Avenue sidewalk waving honk for 
peace signs.
Lets make war no more pounded through 
the air as Saturday afternoon traffic hissed by 
and gray skies threatened rain. Some motorists 
slowed down, flashing a brief gesture of peace 
and leaning on their horns to show support. 
Others swore and spat, telling the protestors to 
get a job.
Organized by the Thomas Merton Center, a 
Pittsburgh peace and social justice foundation 
established in 1972, the protest extolled the 
merits of a peaceful approach to foreign policy
and called for the US and Britain to cease air 
attacks on Iraq.
The crowds passion was matched perhaps 
only by its diversity. Old. Young. Black. 
White. Hispanic. Asian. Christian. Muslim. 
Jewish. The only noticeable void in the crowd 
was the absence of a youthful demographic. 
Carnegie Mellon activists organized a march 
from the campus to the site of the rally, but the 
gesture attracted precious few students.
As it stood, the rally.was filled by what could 
best be described as aging, steely-eyed veter
ans of Vietnam protests. There were more 
than a few antique peace buttons pinned to 
ragged fatigues and tie-dyes. The swarm, 
depleted of the youthful fervor many enjoyed 
three decades ago, seemed weary, albeit unde
terred, by preaching a message of peace and 
respect that seems lost not only on their gov
ernment, but on todays youth.
Still, some seemed optimistic.
Tim Vining, executive director of the 
Thomas Merton Center, still believes that there 
is an important niche for todays youth in the 
activist sector.
I think that the peace movement will even
tually come largely from people under 30, 
said Vining.

People of all creeds and ages gathered in front of Soldiers and Sailors on Fifth Avenue last Saturday to

Gubernatorial candidates debate issues at Penn State
by Anne Jolis
,nTHEA RNIssrAHNaA
To kick off the first debate of this years guber
natorial race last Thursday, Democrat Ed Rendell 
and Republican Mike Fisher stuck to the positives 
of their own agendas, despite the negative cam
paigning tactics criss-crossing the airwaves last 
week.
Before an audience of college students at Penn 
State last week, the candidates were eager to lay 
out their key issues, especially in education reform.
Libertarian Ken Krawchuk and Green Party can
didate Mike Morrill were strong presences at the 
debate, though the race is no doubt between 
Rendell (backed by 51 percent of registered voters) 
and Fisher (with 44 percent) according to the lat
est polls.
Speaking to The Tartan after the debates, Morrill 
acknowledged that his chances at the governors 
seat were slim, but said that this race was only a 
stepping-stone.
Were in this to build political power, and we 
know that that is going to be a long and slow 
process, he said. Were not going to be disap
pointed by short-term numbers because were not 
in this for short-term victories.
The debate covered many issues, from crime to 
the economy, but education was the most thor
oughly discussed. The four candidates spent a 
great deal of time laying out their proposed strate
gies for resurrecting Pennsylvanias schools, 
addressing kindergarten all the way up through 
college.
I wouldnt mandate a full day of pre-kindergarten for all children, but its absolutely essential 
that every child be able to read by third grade, 
said Fisher.
The other candidates nodded when Rendell said, 
[pre-kindergarten education] cant be just glori
fied childcare, but it must be a quality educational 
experience.
Candidates also addressed the fiscal disparity 
that exists in public schools across the state of 
Pennsylvania. Fisher was adamant that while equal

opportunity for every child is important, the 
money, regardless of amount, needs to be spent 
more wisely. Morrill evoked warm applause from 
the audience when he said that he would not 
accept the idea that education should be made 
more equitable  that that was wholly insufficient 
 but that Pennsylvanias job would not be done 
until education was completely equal throughout 
the commonwealth.
Even in answering questions regarding other 
issues, the candidates remembered their locale and 
consistently related the issues back to education.
When the question of the states economy was 
raised, and how it could be improved so as to keep 
recent college giaduates in Pennsylvania, Fisher 
proposed his idea of forming a stronger coalition 
among schools and business.
We need to do a better job. I want to have a 
much closer relationship between our high 
schools, our colleges, and our business community. 
We need to educate our kids for the jobs of tomor
row, Fisher said.
Greek system joins the sexes, 
still keeps different standards
Sororities offer companionship on a male-dominated campus
by Jeannie Choi
RNIssrAHNaA
Jennifer Dos Santos, a junior 
electrical and computer engineer
ing major, has struggled for the 
past two years.
There arent a lot of girls in my 
major, so it is difficult for me to find 
female friends, said Dos Santos.
In an attempt to widen her circle 
of female friends, Dos Santos 
decided to undergo formal mem
bership recruitment (FMR), the 
sorority recruitment process. She 
completed FMR last week and 
joined Kappa Alpha Theta, some
thing she thought she would never 
do.
I was hesitant at first and I had 
my doubts, but once I met the girls 
and saw how nice they all were, I 
was really excited to join, she said.
With a male to female ratio near 
3:2, the female population histori
cally has had a difficult time adjust
ing to life on a male-dominated 
campus. In many of the majors, 
namely ones in CIT and MCS, 
women find themselves mostly 
among male professors and peers.
Many women see the sorority 
system as an avenue through which 
they can experience the sisterhood 
that they have always wanted and 
gain valuable leadership opportu
nities that might otherwise not be 
as readily available to them on 
campus. Opportunities are given to 
them by the different activities that 
both the fraternities and sororities 
sponsor for the campus and the 
community throughout the year.
Students really underestimate 
what the Greek community does 
for our campus and how much 
money the Greeks raise through 
their fund-raising activities, said 
Renee Camerlengo, director of stu
dent life. The fraternities and 
sororities really step up and take on 
leadership positions that teach 
them a lot about being examples 
for the community.
Some leadership positions 
include planning charity events 
such as the annual Quarter Mile of 
Quarters, co-sponsored by the fra
ternity Kappa Delta Rho and the 
sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma, to 
raise money for the Childrens 
Hospital. These events require 
chairpersons and committees to 
make them run smoothly. Both the 
sororities and fraternities partici
pate in planning activities such as 
this one, and both contribute their 
leadership.
But as much as the sorority sysA Dual Greek Systemn
tem helped to break down tradi
tional ideologies of inequality 
between males and females, the 
differences between how fraterni
ties and sororities operate begs the 
question of whether sororities are a 
bastion of feminism or chauvinism 
for one simple reason: the women 
are still being held to a much dif
ferent standard than the men.
Because most of the fraternities 
and sororities are tied to larger, 
national organizations, each local 
chapter is required to follow a set of 
regulations that are defined by 
their national heads. For the frater
nities, the organization is the 
National Interfratemity Conference, 
for the sororities, the Pan Hellenic 
Conference.
Although both organizations 
have a mandated list of rules that 
all members must abide by, the reg
ulations for the fraternities are 
much more flexible than the regu
lations for the sororities.
Most of the differences between 
the fraternity and sorority regula
tions concern the membership 
recruitment process and risk man
agement policies. For the fraterni
ties, recruitment rules are much 
simpler than the sorority rules.
For example, in the Delta 
Upsilon Loss Prevention Policy doc
ument, outlined by their national 
chapter, there is only one rush 
event regulation, requiring that, 
All rush activities associated with 
any chapter will be a dry rush func
tion. This rule  and this rule 
alone  is the only regulation 
regarding rush activities for the 
rest of the fraternities.
The sororities, however, utilize 
an extensive formal membership 
recruitment process in which all 
the women on campus interested in 
sorority life are exposed to all five 
of the chapter houses that are avail
able at CMU.
The rules for this process are 
clearly outlined and detailed. 
These rules require one FMR chair 
per sorority to insure that all five of

Israelis demolish 
Arafats compound
' RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)  
Explosions rocked Yasir Arafats com
pound Saturday, including one that 
showered him with debris, as the 
Israeli army systematically blew up or 
bulldozed nearly every building 
abound him in the Palestinian 
Authoritys headquarters. 
r- Arafat, a few aides, and about 20 
men wanted by Israel were trapped in 
a few rooms in a wing of the main 
office building  the only main 
Structure left standing in the once 
sprawling complex.
-'The White House and the 
European Union on Friday urged
* fsrael not to go too far in its reprisal 
for  Tel Aviv bus bombing that killed 
six people.
Israels defense minister said he 
'wanted to isolate Arafat, but not
* harm or expel him. He said troops 
would stay until the surrender of the 
wanted men, including the West 
Bank intelligence chief.
- However, Israel TVs Channel Two, 
citing defense officials, said the ulti
mate objective of the assault was to 
Confine Arafat to a tiny area in diffi
cult conditions and prompt him to 
seek exile. Arafat has said he would
 never again leave Palestinian lands.
Arafats advisers said they feared
* the office building might collapse and 
that he was in the line of fire of 
snipers.
President Arafat and those with 
him are in danger, a key aide, Nabil 
Abu Rdeneh, said early Saturday, 
appealing for immediate internation
al intervention. 
H ~ - A photographer holed up alongside 
Arafat said a tank shell slammed into 
the floor above them early Saturday,
1 showering Arafat with dust and
- debris but not wounding him.
 The raid  the third on the com
pound since March  was launched 
late Thursday in retaliation for a sui
cide bombing on a Tel Aviv bus that 
' killed five Israelis and a 19-year-old 
Jewish seminary student from 
Scotland.
By early Saturday, Arafat found 
himself caught in the tightest Israeli 
chokehold yet. All the main buildings 
in his headquarters  except for a 
wing of his office building  had 
been demolished.
Bulldozers were also tearing out 
sections of sleeping quarters for secu
rity officers and the back part of 
Arafats office building.
Bush about-faces, 
wants 9-11 probe
WASHINGTON (AP)  With a con
gressional inquiry into the September 
11 attacks winding down, President 
Bush reversed himself and backed the 
creation of an independent investiga
tive commission.
The commission has been strongly 
supported by relatives of September 
11 victims and many members of 
Congress.
The House has already approved 
creating a commission and the Senate 
was expected to consider a proposal 
next week.
But some victims relatives were 
disappointed about a letter from the 
White House Friday to congressional 
leaders.
The letter said that the commission 
should look at matters including 
coordination between the intelli
gence community and non-national 
security agencies, border security and 
visa issues, commercial aviation and 
the role of state and local govern
ments.
Stephen Push, a leader of one 
group of victims relatives, said the 
letter suggested the new investigation 
wouldnt look into failures by intelli
gence agencies  the matter now 
being considered by the joint HouseSenate inquiry.
Push noted that this weeks public 
hearings on the attacks revealed an 
array of missed clues by intelligence 
agencies.
This is disgraceful what were 
learning about intelligence failures 
and the White House is trying to 
cover it up, he said.
Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., who led 
the House efforts to form a commis
sion, said he was pleased by the 
administrations reversal, but added: 
We dont want it to exclude any
thing. Everything should be on the 
table.
While not ruling out additional 
examinations of past security mis
takes, senior White House officials 
said the administration prefers to see 
the commission look at domestic vul
nerabilities.
The White House had long opposed 
an independent commission, citing 
concerns about possible security 
leaks and distracting officials from 
the fight against terrorism.
Last May, President Bush said any 
inquiry should be conducted by 
Congress.
Senior advisers, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity, said the president 
decided to back the commission now 
in response to requests from victims 
survivors.

Mom taped hitting 
child, may give up
MISHAWAKA, Ind. (AP)  A weeklong search is over for a mother who 
punched, shook and slapped her fouryear-eld daughter in a beating cap
tured on a department store video
tape and televised natonwide.
Madalyne Gorman Toogood, 26, 
was expected to turn herself in to 
police Saturday, according to Steven 
Rosen, a Houston lawyer who said he 
represents the woman.
Rosen made the announcement at 
a news conference in Chicago on 
Friday night, several hours after he 
contacted police who had been 
searching for the mother and daugh
ter since September 13.
It was a bad choice, and it was 
captured on candid camera, Rosen 
said. Shes very remorseful. She 
regrets it.
Police in Mishawaka, about 60 
miles east of Chicago, said they had 
been in contact with Rosen by tele
phone, but had no specific informa
tion about when or where Toogood 
might turn herself in.
Authorities feared the girl, Martha 
Toogood, might have been seriously 
injured in the beating outside a Kohls 
store in Mishawaka.
Rosen said Toogoods extended 
family members and friends told him 
the child was fine and had been 
examined by a doctor. The child was 
examined, and the child was mental
ly and physically stable, he said.
The girl was with her mother 
Friday night, and the womans two 
sons, ages 5 and 6, were in good, 
safe hands, Rosen said in Saturdays 
ftHiIhE RnTcHdapl
An arrest warrant issued Friday 
charged the mother with battery to a 
child.
Rosen said Toogood grew up as 
part of a group of Texas-based Irish 
Travellers, itinerant laborers who
often make their living with homeimprovement and business-repair 
work, such as paving, painting and 
roofing. Mishawaka authorities said 
they had no indication Toogood has 
ever been accused of abuse. However, 
they said she did have a history of 
retail store fraud.
Judge mulls bail 
in NY terror case
BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)  A federal 
judge said the Constitution, not fears 
about terrorism, will guide his deci
sion about whether six suspected 
members of a New York terror cell 
must remain jailed until their trial.
US Magistrate H. Kenneth 
Schroeder Jr. asked prosecution and 
defense lawyers to file memoranda 
next week and said he will rule by 
October 3.
I know there are people out there 
who say if we let these people out and 
we have another 9-11  God forbid 
 but thats a risk I would be taking, 
Schroeder said Friday after three 
days of arguments about bail risks. 
Im not concerned with what other 
people think.
Schroeder said his aim is to protect 
the Constitution, which he called 
probably the most valuable aspect of 
all.
Prosecutors allege the six men, all 
US citizens of Yemeni descent and 
Muslims, were schooled in the tools 
of terror, including the use of suicide 
as a weapon, at a camp run by Osama 
bin Ladens al Qaida network in 
Afghanistan.
Defense attorneys describe the 
men as victims of misinformation 
who pose no danger and wont flee. 
All requested bail.
Five of the men were arrested last 
week after a series of raids in 
Lackawanna, five miles south of 
Buffalo. The sixth was detained in 
Bahrain and flown back.
Assistant US Attorney William 
Hochul argued that the men must 
remain jailed to prevent the possibili
ty of a terrorist act.

College date rape 
anxiety increases
SELINSGROVE (U-WIRE)  At 
Susquehanna University, students 
may think date rape is not a prob
lem. But according to university 
administrators, it is a fear that 
quickly turns into a harsh reality 
for victims.
In recent years, male and 
female students alike have report
ed increased feelings of anxiety in 
response to the problem.
It happens everywhere, said 
Katherine Bradley, counseling 
center director. Here at 
Susquehanna, our problem is 
comparable, but definitely not 
higher, than that at other universi
ties.
Date rape often occurs when 
the drug Rohypnol, commonly 
known as roofies, is slipped into 
a beverage. Rohypnol is relatively 
easy to obtain and simply dis
solves when immersed in liquid. It 
is colorless, odorless, and taste
less, but its potency leads to 
extremely strong effects such as 
lowered inhibition, memory 
impairment, dizziness, drowsi
ness, and confusion.
It makes me nervous (at frater
nity parties) when there are open 
drinks everywhere, a sophomore 
female who asked to be anony
mous said. Since our school is 
small and everyone knows every
one, I usually feel pretty safe, but
its never good to leave a drink unat
tended.
Bradley agreed that the number 
one safety precaution for students is 
not to leave an open drink unattend
ed.
At a party, if you lose sight of your 
drink for even a few seconds, just get 
a fresh one, Bradley advised. Make 
a deal with friends not to leave each 
other alone, and have a plan of 
action. For example, if one friend 
meets a guy, know in advance what 
the others should do.
Another safety measure students 
should follow is not to walk to and 
from parties alone, Bradley said.
While it helps to be in a group, 
rape doesnt happen because a girl 
walked home from a party alone, 
Bradley said.
Rape happens because its a part 
of our culture. Unfortunately, its part 
of our nature. Until we change that 
aspect of culture, no matter how care
ful people are, things will still hap
pen.
According to the Pennsylvania 
Coalition Against Rape, 85 percent of 
rape victims know who their attacker 
is.
Most victims dont identify what 
happened as an assault, Bradley 
said. A girl will think, Oh this guy 
was being such a jerk. They dont 
always report it as a violation of their 
rights.

The report is based on data 
from the 1999-2000 National 
Postsecondary Student Aid Study, 
a nationwide demographic survey 
conducted by the Office of 
Educational Research and

The study shows that graduat

age of 15.8 percent receiving these 
marks. However, 35.4 percent of 
undergraduates from the study 
receive these grades.
Many students agreed with the 
report.

Pittsburgh attracts 
PGA tournament
PITTSBURGH (AP)  When Tiger 
Woods played an exhibition round at 
the plush Nemacolin Woodlands 
resort five years ago, he turned to 
resort owner Joe Hardy and said, 
You ought to play a PGA tournament 
here.
For at least the next four years, 
they will.
The tournament formerly known 
as the Pennsylvania Classic has been 
renamed the 84 Lumber Classic and 
will be played on the resorts boulderstrewn Mystic Rock course from 
2003-06. The sponsors have an 
option through 2008.
With Thursdays official announce
ment, the Pittsburgh area  previ
ously host to seven U.S. Opens and 
five PGA Championships  will have 
a full-time PGA Tour stop for the first 
time. However, it also means that 
Philadelphia, the nations fifthlargest metropolitan area, is again 
without a PGA tournament.
The Pennsylvania Classic rotated 
between the two cities for three years 
with little fanfare and poor atten
dance, attributable to mostly weak 
fields and the mid-September sched
uling.
Last years tournament at Laurel 
Valley in Ligonier drew a decent field 
after the Ryder Cup was postponed, 
but the galleries were small, as they 
were for last weeks event at 
Waynesborough Country Club near 
Philadelphia.
To raise interest and perhaps land a 
few more names, Hardy and his 
daughter, 84 Lumber president 
Maggie Hardy Magerko, will raise the 
purse from $3.3 million to $4 million 
 as much as the Western Open and 
Canadian Open paid this year. The 
purse will increase to $4.6 million by 
2006.
With the PGA Tour scrambling to 
replace six tournament title sponsors 
for 2003 amid an economic down
turn, and Hardy willing to pay a mid

Judge denies bail 
in Constant case
Edward Constant, the Carnegie 
Mellon history professor who last 
May was charged with shooting and 
attempting to kill a police officer, was 
denied bail last Friday at the 
Allegheny County Courthouse.
Constant returned to the Allegheny 
County Jail to await his trial, which 
according to his lawyer is set to begin 
on February 3.
Constant is charged with one count 
of attempted homicide, four counts of 
aggravated assault, and once count of 
simple assault.
The charges stem from an incident 
late last May, in which Constant shot 
at two police officers responding to a 
domestic dispute at his home in Mt. 
Lebanon.
Constants wife, Susan, is free on 
bond, and awaits trial as well. She is 
charged with two counts of reckless 
endangerment, and one count each 
of obstructing the administration of 
law and hindering the apprehension 
of Edward Constant.
Looking Ahead
The United States government 
has determined Californias 
state fish, the golden trout, may need 
to be placed on the endangered 
species list.
The US Fish and Wildlife Service 
said Friday there is substantial evi
dence to support listing the trout. The 
finding comes almost a year after the 
conservation group Trout Unlimited 
sued the agency to force it to consider 
such a move.
A jury was chosen Friday in the 
case of a former police officer 
accused in the stationhouse bath
room torture of Haitian immigrant 
Abner Louima.
The jurors were told that US mar
shals would bring them Monday 
morning to hear opening statements 
in the trial of Charles Schwarz.
Schwarz, 36, who already has 
served 33 months for an earlier con
viction that was overturned, wants 
less time, the reports said.
The state agreed to calculate 
refunds owed to hundreds of 
thousands of Arizona taxpayers who 
will share in a proposed $350 million 
settlement for improper taxation of 
some corporate dividends.
Attorneys have said 675,000 tax
payers may be eligible for refunds 
under the case, which resulted in an 
Arizona Supreme Court ruling that 
taxpayers could join class-action law
suits to press tax claims.

Tigers mauls six 
year old at school
SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif. (AP)  
A tiger grabbed a child by his head 
Friday at a school assembly, send
ing the 6-year-old boy to a hospital.
A trainer was leading the tiger 
from an auditorium at Baymonte 
Christian School when it lurched 
over seats and grabbed the boys 
head in its jaws, police Capt. Harry 
Bidleman said.
The boy received stitches for a 
cut along his hairline, according to 
Dr. Phillip Harter at Lucile Packard 
Childrens Hospital in Palo Alto.
Hes a very lucky young man. 
Hes been up talking to us and 
smiling, Harter said. A CT scan 
found no other injuries, he said.
The tigers appearance was a 
reward for students who sold mag
azine subscriptions.
Police planned to coordinate an 
investigation with animal control 
agencies.
The tiger acted out of playful
ness, and did not attack, said Anita 
Jackson, an employee of Zoo to 
You.
She was never aggressive, said 
Jackson, the companys supervisor 
of animal care and training. She 
just saw them playing and she 
wanted to play as well.
Colorado students 
lose 52-mile bet
BOULDER (U-WIRE)  The 
Chinese say the journey of 10,000
miles begins with but a single step. 
For University of Colorado tri
executives Latifah Al-Attas and 
Mike Donnelly and other 
University of Colorado Student 
Union staff members, a 52-mile 
walk begins with a football game 
gone bad.
The group will walk 52 miles to 
Fort Collins this weekend after los
ing a bet to Colorado State 
Universitys student leaders that 
CUs football team would beat CSU 
in the annual Rocky Mountain 
Showdown game between the 
schools Labor Day Weekend.
They will follow US Highway 
287 to the rival city. Upon arrival 
in Fort Collins Saturday night, 
CSUs student government will 
host a dinner for the CU walkers.
The Buffs lost 19-14 to CSU at 
the August 31 football game at 
Invesco Field at Mile High in 
Denver.
The tri-executives are enthusias
tic about the long trek and are hop
ing for a favorable weather situa
tion and the company of their fel
low students.
Hopefully a lot of people will 
come out, Al-Attas said. But if 
not, it will be good to get to know 
Mike (Donnelly) and the staff bet
ter.
In years past, the student gov
ernments at CU and CSU have 
made similar bets that have includ
ed dyeing hair, dunking booths 
and kissing the nether-regions of 
the winning schools mascot.
This years bet is a revival of a 
wager placed five years ago 
between the schools.

CMU professor gets 
million dollar grant
The head of biological sciences 
department Professor Elizabeth 
Jones is one of the Howard Hughes 
Medical Institute (HHMI) scientists 
who will receive $1 million over the 
course of four years to find construc
tive and creative teaching tools. She 
was chosen out of 150 nominees from 
leading universities such as Stanford, 
Harvard, Northwestern, and MIT.
She said she will use the grant to 
develop genetics cognitive tutor soft
ware that will direct undergraduate 
students through a problem solving 
process while helping them to learn 
at a quicker pace.
Albert Corbett, a senior researcher 
in the Human Computer Interaction 
Institute who is working alongside 
Jones, said, Its a very big deal. This 
project represents an important and 
innovative extension of the educa
tional technology to help students 
with scientific inference and experi
mental design in the biological sci
ences.
Genetics is a challenging course. 
Once we develop the tutor, it can be 
used anywhere students are learning 
genetics, not just at Carnegie 
Mellon, said Jones.
Former school of

Harry Franklin, former head and 
longtime professor of the School of 
Music, died from congestive heart 
failure Friday at the age of 85.
Born May 25, 1917, he took piano 
lessons as a child. His illustrious 
career took him from the Julliard 
Graduate School in New York, where 
he played with such greats as Lorin 
Maazel, William Steinberg, and Igor 
Stravinsky, to being the pianist for the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
Franklin was a professor of piano 
and chamber music at Carnegie
Mellon from 1957 to 1996, where he 
impacted the lives of countless young 
musicians.
Franklin is survived by his wifp, 
Joan, son, Richard, and daughter, 
Linda Tobin. Friends will be received 
from 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 p.m. Tuesday in 
Levinson Room A, Jewish 
Community Center, Irene Kaufman

PDPsi to hold selfdefense help clinic
In response to a rape last year and 
the sexual assault on campus August 
25, Pi Delta Psi, an Asian cultural 
interest fraternity, is hosting a fr$e 
self-defense clinic led by a martial 
arts specialist on October 10 at 7 pm.
I know a lot of boyfriends on cam
pus with their girlfriends walkiug 
around, and theyre asking, do you 
know where I can buy a can of mace? 
said George Jeng, a PDPsi brother 
and mechanical engineering student.
According to Jeng, the fraternity 
looked at about ten different martial 
art studios in the area before the HEA 
Black Belt Academy offered to con
duct the clinic for free.
Its my senior year, and I thought it 
was a safe campus because of the size 
and tightness of the student body, but 
to hear that these types of events hap
pen, and they happen in the open, 
said David Qu, senior biology and 
psychology double major and PDPsi 
brother.
Campus police offer a course in 
self-defense as well, but Qu said he 
doesnt feel its publicized enough. 
According to Qu, PDPsi is doing more 
than making posters. , 1
The fraternity has contacted soror
ities and worked with them to publi
cize the event.  ^
Theyre obviously more in touch 
with our target audience than we 
are, Qu said.
According to Jeng, at least $0 
attendants are expected from the 
sororities, but he hopes more stu
dents will come. If the event is suc
cessful, Qu said PDPsi will make it an 
annual event.

Pitt royalty may 
be dethroned
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  One 
of University of Pittsburghs tradi
tions may be in jeopardy of losing its 
sponsor of recent years.
Omicron Delta Kappa, an honors 
society that has organized Pitts 
Homecoming king and queen con
test, may no longer organize it as of 
this year, according to its president, 
Colleen Lamb.
Lamb said that ODK is currently 
doing research to decide if it is still 
interested in sponsoring the event. 
The research, she said, involves 
looking at other colleges in the 
Association of American Universities, 
which are colleges comparable to 
Pitt  such as Penn State, Syracuse 
and Rutgers universities  and 
seeing if these schools are continu
ing to carry on the tradition.
She said that other schools some
times use different criteria to deter
mine the Homecoming court, such 
as campus involvement or acade
mics, and that different groups 
organize the event.
At Pitt, its simply a popularity 
contest, she said, referring to the 
fact that the Homecoming court are 
elected by student voters.
Lamb said the race, which used to 
be handled by Pitt Program Council, 
may not fit into what ODK sees as its 
campus responsibility.
ODKs under a new advisor, and 
we kind of see this as a turning point 
year, Lamb said. [Were] getting it 
back on track to what its supposed 
to be and what it was designed to 
be.
Joyce Giangarlo, the advisor for 
Student Government Board, took 
over as the ODK adviser after the 
departure of former Director of 
Student Activities Joe Cavalla.
Lamb stressed that the decision 
was not official yet.
No determinations have been 
made, she said. We have never 
said that this is going to happen this 
year.
She said that she had not even 
discussed the possibility with the 
other ODK officers, just Giangarlo 
and two Homecoming chairs, whose 
names she refused to provide, say
ing that it was rush season and that 
both needed to stay out of the news.
SGB president Kevin Washo said
that he was committed to saving the 
contest if the students wanted it.
Even if something happens with 
ODK, somewhere else in the 
University should seriously consider 
picking up where [ODK] left off, 
Washo said. We have to start think
ing very hard.
SAT scores dont 
include minorities
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
Colleges and universities all over the 
United States pride themselves on the 
accomplishments of their first-years, 
including the average of their SAT 
scores. The University of Pittsburgh is 
no exception.
However, for more than 30 years, 
the average at Pitt, among other insti
tutions, hasnt included every firstyear, according to Robert Hill, Vice 
Chancellor for Public Affairs at Pitt.
Pitt is part of a growing number of 
schools leaving certain special 
access groups out of the average. 
Special access simply means socio
economically disadvantaged stu
dents. In other words, said Hill, the 
poor and talented. Those left out of 
the SAT ranks include students from 
underrepresented groups and some 
athletes. However, Hill insists that the 
issue is not race-related.
In the gIiN yEEv BJJYBJJBm the 
bottom of the page denotes that SAT 
scores were available for 98 percent 
of full-time, first-years, and 
exclude [s] students admitted 
through special access programs.
But despite this, some students 
were surprised and angered by the 
news. Margarita Tran, an undergrad
uate in the College of General 
Studies, said, [It seems like] they 
just want to look good.
DeShaun Sewell, president of Pitts 
Black Action Society, was also unhap
py with the practice, stating that she 
was speechless.
If the University doesnt include 
those students in the average, theyre 
not giving a complete picture of the 
various types and capabilities of the 
students, she said.
Hill, when asked about students 
concerns about the SAT scoring 
replied that he could not comment on 
that issue. I havent talked to anyone 
who expressed anger, Hill said.
Hill explained that the basis for the 
policy is to give prospective students 
a more accurate idea of the level at 
which they will be expected to per
form. Special access groups are char
acteristically not admitted on the 
basis of their grades and scores.
Elegantly furnished one- or two-bedroom apartment suites include an equipped kitchen, 
fluffy linens, TV, VCR, cable movies, free local phone service, and reserved parking.
Conveniently located at 5405 Fifth Avenue, Shadyside. Two blocks from Walnut Streets

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 23, 2002
Student senate moves to
annual spring electionsProtestors call for a disclosure of secrets
RALLY, from page Al
by Tim Bowen
,nTHEA RNIssrAHNaA
 October 29 marks the last time 
students will cast their votes for stu
dent senators in the fall. In coming 
years the fall and spring elections 
will be consolidated in an effort to 
increase voter education and 
turnout for a single election, to be 
held in the spring.
The changes to the election 
process are the product of the stu
dent government reform committee 
that was created by last years stu
dent body president, Adam Harber, 
to address several operational issues 
of student government. The mem
bers of the committee were drawn 
from all branches of student govern
ment as well as members of the stu
dent body not involved in govern
ment.
1 We wanted a mixed group of 
people who understood govern
ment and students who vote, said 
J3rian Namey, student body presi
dent and former vice president.
I The committee examined the stu
dent governments of several other 
Schools in their efforts to streamline 
the Universitys election process.
! We pretty much looked at other 
colleges, said Mark Egerman, a 
junior computer science, history, 
and engineering and public policy 
triple-major who was involved in 
the committee. None of the col
leges studied used a staggered elec
tion process.
 Egerman said he provided more 
of an antagonistic role on the com
mittee.
; I was there to remind them hey 
^uys, this doesnt make sense, this 
isnt what people feel about you,  
said Egerman.
1 Namey said that staggering elections just isnt useful in a college 
government setting, since it would 
be improbable that there would be a 
massive turnover that leads to an 
inexperienced senate. There is also 
the issue of limited voter interest, 
even among the newest CMU stu
dents.
I wouldnt vote in the fall elec
tion, said first-year MCS student 
Steve Mehaffey.
Drawing more students into the 
election process has been a long
standing goal for Student 
Government, which had seen aver
age voter participation hover 
around five percent until the past 
two spring elections. Namey hopes 
the new system will capitalize on 
the hubbub over student body posi
tion elections.
The spring 2002 student body 
elections were held online for the 
first time, and the number of stu
dents who participated in the elec
tions doubled to over 20 percent of 
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents. Student government, howev
er, may still have a long way to go.
I dont know anything about it. If 
I knew more about it, I would prob
ably vote, said Shan Jiang, a firstyear information systems major.
I didnt know the student senate 
existed, said Steve Mrdjenovich, a 
sophomore architecture student. 
Student government hopes that the 
change to the election schedule will 
change such opinions.
Student government intends to 
continue to try to draw more atten
tion to the elections and to the sys
tem in general.
We could increase the voter 
turnout even more by advertising 
and campaigning, said Katie 
Warren, a senior business adminis
tration major and student govern
ment reform committee member.
As the rally wound down, more 
college-aged activists began to trickle 
in. One young man who wished to be 
referred to only as Alex, showed up 
sporting stacks of flyers in support of 
the rally. A member of the Pittsburgh 
Organizing Group, a union tradition
ally defined by its campaigns for 
causes such as improved 
student/university relations, a living 
wage and same-sex health care bene
fits, Alex was also there to promote 
this weekends trip to DC for the 
IMF/World Bank protest.
Also of note was the presence of 
Morgan Corr, a senior at North Hills 
High School. Corr has gained notori
ety among the Pittsburgh activists in 
the weeks following the 9-11 anniver
sary for choosing to dress completely 
in black and donning white peace 
ribbons on a day the school requested 
everyone wear red, white and blue. 
Corr received predominantly positive 
remarks on this decision.
Even the principal asked me for a 
ribbon, said a smiling Corr, who 
attended the rally but elected not to 
pick up the bullhorn and rally the 
troops. At present, this unique mem
ber of the movement, who character
ized the general youth stance as apa
thetic and lacking, is planning on 
heading to Washington, D.C. for col
lege and is currently forming an 
amnesty group at North Hills.
Michael Drohan, an economics 
professor at Edinboro University, 
held up a poster of a young girl and 
claimed that this is who dies in war.
Yusef Ali, a Muslim activist and 
guest speaker, expressed concern 
over the negative stereotyping of 
Muslims. This war is a pure example 
of contradiction and hypocrisy, said 
Ali, and it fosters disunity among 
Muslims everywhere.
Dan I. Bolef, a retired physics pro
fessor, compared todays war to conJules Lobell, a one-time professor of law for the University of Pittsburgh, was one of six speakers who addressed the crowd last 
Saturday. Lobell called for an open forum to discuss the situation in Iraq and an end to the secrecy about Iraq.
flicts of the past. I know what it is to 
engage in efforts to kill other people, 
said Bolef, a World War II veteran 
whose 106th infantry division was 
one of the first to be hit in the Battle 
of the Bulge. World War II was 
fought to prevent a racist government 
from killing millions of innocent peo
ple. This war, it seems, is also being 
waged by a racist government, said 
Bolef.
A half dozen speakers took their 
turns on the microphone as the 
crowd continued to swell. Bits of dia
logue were consistently punctuated 
by applause and snippets of anti-war 
cries.
NBC affiliate WPXI showed up long 
enough to tape roughly seven sec
onds of footage that was all but cut 
out of the evening news.
I cant imagine a worse thing that
George W. Bush could do to further 
endanger the lives of Americans both 
at home and abroad, said Vining. 
He later said, Its time for America to 
decide whether its a country, a sover
eign among sovereigns, or an 
empire.
By going to war against the people 
of Iraq with no legitimate justifica
tion, the Bush administration clearly 
establishes the United States as a 
rogue nation to the rest of the 
world, said Saleh Waziruddin, chair 
of the Free Getu Coalition and a 
board member of the Thomas Merton 
Center.
Late last week, President Bush 
appealed to Congress for unlimited 
authority to execute any action 
deemed necessary to calm the Iraq 
situation, including full-scale war
fare.
Bush has justified his stance by 
claiming that Iraq is producing 
weapons of mass destruction and, 
most recently, that the country could 
very well launch a surprise attack 
against the United States or its armed 
forces.
Still, many are not convinced that 
Bushs motivations are as altruistic as 
hed like everyone to think. 
Regarding the characterization of 
Iraqs approval of UN inspectors reen
tering the country being called a 
smoke screen, Ginny Hildebrand, 
one of the rallys speakers said, How 
could he know its a smoke screen 
unless he tries?
Its a macho thing, said Felix 
AuYeung, a graduate student at the 
University of Pittsburgh. Any power 
solidifying military supremacy is a 
step in the wrong direction.

give city new 
college image
by Chelsea Kellner
,nTHEA RNIssrAHNaAI{
; Last Wednesday, a downtown press 
conference unveiled Campus 
Visit/Pittsburgh. The program is a 
three-year, one million dollar collab
orative marketing effort to promote 
Pittsburgh as a bustling college town. 
Sponsored by ten area universities 
and various branches of local govern
ment, Campus Visit Inc., a private 
consulting firm that has assisted in 
setting up similar programs in Boston 
and Philadelphia, is lending 
Pittsburgh a hand in setting up one of 
its own.
; The program will operate primari
ly through an interactive website, a 
toll-free telephone service that will 
provide one-stop hotel reservations, 
;and a travel magazine with a project
ed circulation of 175,000 to high 
schools nationwide.
 Accurate or not, the website, 
CrrrlNtaiEwwahaiHNMliEdm presents 
Pittsburgh as a bustling college town, 
bursting with energy, offering a rich 
variety of cultural events and job 
opportunities galore, accurate or not. 
It also gives an overview of the 
plethora of universities in the region 
to choose from, as well as an assort
ment of information ranging from 
ideas for day trips to tips on student 
discounts.
; Two of the projects main goals are 
to increase student visits to area 
schools and to strengthen the bond 
between current students and the 
city.
; According to the Campus Visit Inc. 
website, 70 percent of students 
choose to attend a college or univer
sity that they physically visited first, 
and students who fail to visit their 
school before enrolling are twice as 
likely to regret their choice later. 
Colleges in the Boston area that par
ticipated in the Campus Visit pro
gram between 1995 and 1999 experi
enced on average a 23 percent 
increase in applications, well above 
the national average over the same 
time period. .
! However, getting students to come 
to school here is only part of the pro
jects objective.
 Keeping students here after they 
graduate is the second part of the 
program.
J It is due to this concern that student body president Brian Namey, 
iwho attended Wednesdays confer
ence as a student consultant, is less 
optimistic of the programs chance 
'for success.
. If the objective of the project is to 
get students to come to school here, 
said Namey,
; I believe itll be very successful. 
But if the objective is to keep them 
here after graduation, I think it needs 
some work. People wont stay here if 
there arent jobs for them. It can be 
Ithe most fun city in the world, but if 
there arent jobs here, they arent 
going to stay.
Good Schools Pennsylvania, a non-profit coalition aiming to improve education across the state, used their artwork outside the Eisenhower 
Auditorium (forum for the 2002 gubernatorial debates) to urge voters and politicians to take education reform more seriously.
GOVERNOR, from page A1
The issue resurfaced throughout the debate, and the candi
dates had several ideas, apart from improving education.
We are the second-oldest state in the country, because so 
many young people see no opportunities and are leaving, said 
Morrill. The other candidates are talking about enticing large 
corporations into Pennsylvania. I think thats wrong; we need to 
put money into small business.
Rendell agreed with Morrill, reminding the audience that
this was the strategy he took when serving as mayor of 
Philadelphia.
The issue that created the most tension in the room that 
evening, one that highlighted the differences among the candi
dates, was crime.
Morrill took a hard line economic approach to the question.
Crime is not going away until we eliminate the intense, 
grinding poverty in Pennsylvania, he said.
Rendell and Fishers views were fairly similar, both stating 
that while prevention of crimes needed to remain a top priority,
the government needed to focus more on preparing the crimi
nals for reinstating themselves in the community.
Krawchuk answered typically. He told the audience that 36 
percent of new prison inmates in Pennsylvania were parole vio
lators and then proposed to ban parole for all violent criminals. 
While he also supported the idea of rehabilitation, he was 
adamant that violent criminals serve their full sentences. He 
also argued that all non-violent drug offenders should be imme
diately pardoned to prevent overcrowding.
Right now, we have people in prison who dont belong there. 
Im talking about marijuana smokers. Pot-smoking Grateful 
Dead fans, he said.
After the debate, Krawchuk interrupted The Tartans inter
view with Fisher: You cant defend this insane war on drugs, 
he said. One point four percent of your prisoners are pot smok
ers. These were peaceful people who were just smoking a joint.
Apart from crime in general, candidates discussed the specif
ic issue of rape and sexual harassment on college campuses.
Rendell proposed sensitivity training for workers in the jus
tice system, suggesting that if the legal system were less intimi
dating to victims, more would come forward and report cases of 
rape and sexual harassment, and the government could make 
more headway in preventing and punishing such crimes.
I want to make the trip to the criminal justice system an eas
ier one for the victims of rape, he said. Fisher attached the 
problem largely to the use of certain drugs, especially Ecstasy 
(in conjunction with alcohol), and seemed confident that if the 
drug problem were improved, sex crimes would soon decrease.
Handguns are a girls best friend, said Krawchuk.
Leaving the auditorium, the spectators were pensive but 
excited about the candidates.
Ive gone Democrat my whole life, but Ed Rendell just does
nt sound like a Democrat to me, said onlooker Linda McDade. 
Joseph Grayeske, an undergraduate Curriculum and 
Instruction student at Penn State, seemed eager to support Ken 
Krawchuk  but not necessarily for political reasons.
He talked about legalizing pot! he said.

Morris to discuss terrorism, 
poverty, and Hilary Clinton
MORRIS, from page A1
on politics, and I just wrote a new 
book called uEraA uwIMl
TT: Do you have any plans on get
ting back into national level poli
tics?
M: I am not working in domestic 
politics anymore, but I find it 
absolutely fascinating to work in 
other countries.
TT: Which parts of your career 
were most exciting?
M: Working in the White House 
[with Clinton] for two years was 
most exciting. I think in retrospect 
the Welfare Reform Act has 
emerged as the most significant 
piece of domestic legislation since 
the 64 and 65 Civil Rights Acts. I 
think that America is assuming an 
incredible role in the world as the 
guarantor of freedom and democ
racy. I think that the good faith 
hand virtue of the American peo
ple is going to be tested in a way it 
hasnt been tested before. We 
arent held in check by any major 
opponent. Just as the last fifty 
years were dominated by nuclear 
arms, the next fifty will be domi
nated by concern over the environ
mental degradation of the planet
such as global warming and cli
mate change. A huge portion of 
politics will have to be leadership

in that field. I think the worlds cli
mate is changing. I think the forest 
fires, droughts, hurricanes, and 
flooding that we have faced the 
last few years are extraordinary. 
They are examples of climate 
changes.
TT: What did you do while you 
were in College? How did you get 
into politics?
M: I majored in government [at 
Columbia University], and I spent 
most of my time in politics while I 
was there. I have been a politician 
since fourth grade.
Sororities have dual impact on women
SORORITIES, from page A1
the houses are involved in the planning and execution of 
FMR. It also states that no member of any sorority may 
mention which sorority they are from to anyone else dur
ing the time of formal membership recruitment, and that 
there be no men or alcohol present at any FMR activities.
They really want each sorority house to undergo a 
mutual recruitment process where all women interested 
get an opportunity to end up at the right house for them, 
said Camerlengo. It is much more scripted than the fra
ternity process, to create a fair and balanced access point 
for all students to be able to come to.
Fraternity recruitment is a more competitive process, 
Camerlengo said. Students come to the houses based on 
whose events are more attractive.
The differences go beyond recruitment policies, howev
er. The Delta Delta Delta executive board has policies on 
risk management, rules regarding topics ranging from 
party favors  which are to be in good taste  to scav
enger hunts  which are prohibited.
Matters such as these, which are not even mentioned in 
fraternity guidelines, are stringently elaborated upon for 
the sororities.
But does the strictness of these rules degrade or uplift 
the sisters at these sororities?
Angela Marasco, a senior in civil engineering, and a 
member of Zeta Psi Sigma  a private house that still falls 
under the jurisdiction of the Pan Hellenic Council  
abides by the regulations and feels they are beneficial.
It isnt a disadvantage to not be able to hold parties at 
our house with alcohol because we can still hold parties 
off campus. There are other options. And this becomes 
less risky for us because we dont have the liabilities that 
fraternities have, Marasco said.
Marasco also feels that the differences between the 
rules for fraternities and sororities are present as a result 
of more inherent differences between males and females.
A womens group is different from a mens group. 
Women get along with each other differently then men 
do. Ultimately, if our rules were the same as the fraterni
ties rules, there would be no difference between fraterni
ties and sororities, said Marasco. There needs to be that 
differentiation though, because womens needs are differ
ent than mens needs.
Andrew Bayowski, president of Delta Tau Delta, 
believes that it is the unusual nature of CMU that has 
caused this difference in fraternity and sorority policy.
CMU is very different from the other campuses that 
also have Greek communities. Were an anomaly. 
Therefore, many of the rules that the National 
Interfraternity council set for all of the chapters do not 
apply to us, said Bayowski. The fraternity system decid
ed to allow us the flexibility to bend the rules a little in 
order to make them better suited for our campus. The 
sororities, on the other hand, took the other side and 
made the rules so strict that each chapter would be the 
same.
Bayowski says that he sees advantages and disadvan
tages in both the fraternity and sorority decisions.
Kasey Adamchik, a sophomore business major and 
Greek peer advisor for Kappa Kappa Gamma, sees both 
sides of the situation.
Some of the rules are really strict and ridiculous, 
Adamchik said. But they are fair and made up for our 
benefit by women that are also from these same houses. 
We have a really nice, safe, and clean environment to live 
in and it is a good environment for friendships and per
sonal growth.
She did not feel that the stricter rules had any bearing 
on gender degradation.
The Pan Hellenic is made up of girls who were involved 
in sororities as well. It is women who are making these 
rules, so how can they be sexist? Women are the leaders 
in this situation, and these women are now helping us 
become leaders like them.

w . tt h I Dining Services serves up high prices 
and low quality to impotent students
Dining Services has betrayed the trust 
of students through usury and ineptitude. 
ood prices are skyrocketing, eating 
options are declining, and food prepara
tion has been bungled. Students have 
long expressed concerns over food on 
campus, but the University has failed to 
supply answers. Continued ignorance of 
student concerns now makes the situation 
fiscally unbearable.
The cost of a 36-block meal plan has 
risen to an amazing $3,320 per year. Just 
down the street at the University of 
Pittsburgh, students receive 38 block 
meals and an extra $320 in dining dollars 
for a mere additional $50.
Combine the above figures with the fact 
that Pitts food quality and selection are 
simply better, and it becomes hard to 
believe that such malpractice has been 
tolerated for so long. In conjunction with 
Parkhurst, a subsidiary of Eat n Park 
Corporation, CMU extorts money from 
yry student that accepts enrollment at 
Carnegie Mellon.
There are no dining price options. 
Every first-year on campus, excluding fra
ternity brothers, pays $3,320 a year to 
eat, or perhaps to not eat, bad food. At Pitt 
at least, if you find the food disagreeable, 
you can pay as little as $950 per semester.
And what is this $3,320 for? Dinner 
blocks figure at an unreasonable $7.20. 
The dinner isnt even worth the high cost. 
This generates complications for upper
classmen that get sucked into paying 
extortionist prices because of conve
nience. The first-years are being robbed 
of their money through required inflexi
ble meal plans.
If you purchase food at Grab n Go, you 
cannot buy an entre without a side dish. 
A! dining services employee will kindly 
remind you that you get a free side dish 
with your food, or two side dishes. But
you cant just buy a piece of chicken. 
Dining services employees tell you that 
the appetizer is free with the entre, but 
the price says otherwise.
And dont expect the proper condi
ments with your poorly prepared food, 
either. Dont expect soy sauce or 
dumpling sauce with your overcooked 
dumplings. Dont expect barbeque sauce 
with your dry, crusty chicken tenders. 
Dont expect tartar sauce, vinegar, or 
horseradish with your fish. They fry it. 
You eat it.
What kind of meal plan has a person 
pay $4.95 for five hot wings? Why is the 
meat and bread quality-price relationship 
at the East Street Deli substandard to 
what any of us buy at the supermarket? 
Why is there no communal dining hall? 
Some universities suffer from high prices 
or low food quality, but Carnegie Mellon 
students put up with both and cant even 
eat together.
Prices and quality are of course merely 
two of Dining Services problems. 
Employees have expressed discontent 
with high employee turnover, inadequate 
training, and poor food quality too. In a 
Tartan article last February, one employ
ee told how Parkhursts arrival meant 
such cost-cutting measures as watering 
down Italian meat sauce with more toma
to paste.
The break-even mandate given to 
CMUs Dining Services just isnt feasible. 
The University should consider Dining 
Services a loss-leader or a public good, 
much like Escort or Counseling Services. 
There is no compromise. Slow improve
ment at this point is intolerable, and there 
are only problems to be fixed. A student 
boycott of campus eateries would be 
appropriate, but then the University 
could make even more money courtesy of 
the students barren wallets.

Improved spooling software 
necessary to stop printing abuse
The fall semester is only a month old, and 
Students can once again expect extensive 
Queues, countless paper jams, and unneces
sary headaches from cluster printers around 
gampus. The problem is hardly an unfamil
iar one; too many public printers are unreli
able, typically plagued by students printing 
more than the rarely-enforced job limit of 
50 pages. In order to make printing on cam
pus more user-friendly, Computing Services 
'must implement several changes: promi
nent posting of cluster printing regulations, 
constant and regular availability of cluster 
consultants, and most significantly, a 
change to spooler software capable of 
enforcing printing limits, which would help 
to keep print queues at a reasonable length.
Carnegie Mellons lax computing policies 
stand in stark contrast to those at other uni
versities. At the University of Pittsburgh, 
spiidents have a limit of 900 printed pages 
per semester; those who want to exceed it 
must pay seven cents per page thereafter, 
^enn State Universitys printing guidelines 
are even more strict; students have a 110- 
page (double-sided) limit per semester, and 
additional printing can be charged to stu
dent accounts at seven cents per page. 
While CMUs liberal printing policy certain
ly has its advantages, the reality is that stu
dent printing is abused and therefore must 
be regulated. Presently, the printer spooling 
software used in clusters cannot count doc
ument pages, making student compliance 
the only measure of job limit enforcement
 evidently a very ineffective measure.
In addition to software that would man
age queues, violators of cluster printing 
policies should be warned, fined, and even
tually suspended from printing privileges 
when limits are exceeded.
Computing Services can take a number of 
steps immediately to improve campus com
puter labs. First, every cluster should post 
clear instructions on how to check the 
queue and how to cancel print jobs. The

Baker Hall 140 labs have small signs 
describing this process, but queues are not 
as readily visible as they are in the Wean 
clusters, where public monitors display 
queue progress. Teaching printer and clus
ter etiquette in Computing Skills Workshop 
would also be a valuable method to alleviate 
printer abuse. Many students are unaware 
of how to check the queues and therefore 
send items to the printer when there is no 
hope of seeing documents within the next 
several hours. Cluster users wait in front of 
printers, become frustrated when their jobs 
fail to print, and exacerbate the problem by 
proceeding to print entire jobs over again, 
often sending them to multiple printers to 
be on the safe side. In addition to clogging 
the system, such practices result in a 
tremendous waste of paper. Even having 
double-sided printing in all labs would help 
to reduce paper costs and wasted output.
Cluster Consultants (CCons) should also 
be more visible in the clusters, and they 
should exercise their authority to delete 
print jobs that violate cluster policies. As it 
stands, CCons are often difficult to find in 
the event of printer malfunctions, further 
delaying progress until one can be located 
to service the cluster.
Finally, printer maintenance should be a 
high priority  there is no use having print
ers in Morewood Gardens when it is notori
ous for its unreliability. Installing additional 
printers in clusters will not solve the prob
lem  people will likely continue to abuse 
printing guidelines and just back up the 
new printer queues.
Computing Services cannot continue to 
turn a blind eye to students blatant noncompliance of print job limits. Excessive 
print jobs should either be refused or sent 
automatically to Grapenut or Pear, the two 
printers in the lower level of Cyert Hall des
ignated for large documents. Only then will 
cluster printers operate satisfactorily for the 
campus community.
Letters to the Editor
Teach with inclusiveness
Editor,
Mr. Cullerss article (Gay agenda goes 
too far, v. 97, i. 3 9/16/02) left many ques
tions in my mind.
I have trouble understanding Mr. Cullers's 
viewpoint on homosexuality being taught in 
public schools. While I agree that morality is 
and should be taught primarily by parents, I 
also feel that because children are exposed 
to school for a majority of their waking 
hours, they will undoubtedly gain some of 
their morality and viewpoints from the 
school. In addition, his view does not permit 
diversity in teaching. I must now look at the 
situation of Evolutionism v. Creationism. 
Isnt it more beneficial to teach both, and let 
students decide for themselves what they 
think is right (with the decision already 
strongly influenced by their upbringing)? 
Existing studies show that homosexuals may 
compose upwards of 10 percent of the popu
lation, showing that GLBT individuals are a 
significant part of society that will not go 
away  nor should they! They have existed 
as far back as recorded history shows, and in 
fact were more accepted during many peri
ods in the past.
Schools exist to teach many viewpoints 
and to imbue knowledge upon those who 
listen. It is not possible to ignore such a sig
nificant portion of society  the conflicts 
between groups has always been a basis for 
history. Hitler did not just massacre Jews  
he also massacred homosexuals and many 
other large groups.
If every controversial piece of history and 
knowledge were removed from the curricu
lum at a school, nothing would be learned. 
GLSEN, PFLAG, Planned Parenthood, and 
many other advisory groups only exist to 
increase knowledge and openness among 
those who are willing to listen and hopeful
ly even those who do not. If people were per
secuted for just being different, the world 
would not be the same.
I dont wish to persecute Mr. Cullers for 
his view and am aware that his opinion is a 
widely-held one among many advocacy 
groups. However, Americas culture is based 
on diversity and its benefits. The public edu
cation system is one of the greatest ways to 
bring together a society with different 
views, and I completely support those 
schools that teach a variety of perspectives.

Show tolerance for gays
Editor,
We feel that the article written by Jeff 
Cullers, Gay agenda goes too far, express
es many ignorant and offensive generalities 
and stereotypes, foremost among them the 
idea that approximately 25 million 
American homosexuals have somehow 
joined forces to promote a single, unified 
agenda. Also highly offensive are the arti
cles frequent and off-hand references to 
homosexuality as not normal, and not 
okay.
Of course, the author takes this point and 
chooses to define normal as a one-mom, 
one-dad family. According to the author, 
one-parent families and traditional extend
ed families are not considered to be true 
families, and are thus not culturally normal. 
Consequently, people living in these situa
tions  a significant portion of the popula
tion  are just as bad as homosexuals. So 
what is the author suggesting? That the 
majority of this country is not normal? If his
tory has taught us anything, it is that 
America is a place of diversity. This country 
has always been a melting pot of cultures 
and people, a land of freedom where differ
ent beliefs and practices can be lived out. 
Acceptance and equality are the driving 
force behind our country, our lives, and also 
our schools.
However, the author thinks that accep
tance of homosexuals should not be taught 
in the school system. He believes that the 
teaching of gay practices would in effect 
convert millions of little boys and girls into 
little homosexuals, taking over the world 
through indoctrination. What is the best 
solution then? If children are not taught 
about different cultures and people, when 
they do finally interact with them they will 
not understand them, and understanding is
the basis of tolerance.
The authors claim that schoolchildren 
are being subjected to demonstrations of 
graphic homosexual activities makes me 
wonder what he considers to be graphic. I 
hardly think that anybody would argue that 
children should witness sexual acts of any 
kind, but there is nothing wrong with allow
ing them to see two people of the same gen
der socially interacting in a healthy and, yes, 
romantic fashion.
The author makes a point of claiming to 
be tolerant of homosexuals. However, he 
evidently does not tolerate the following: 
homosexuals identifying themselves as such 
in the presence of young adults, homosexu
als being depicted in the media as partici
pating in non-dysfunctional family units, 
and homosexuality being discussed by the 
teachers unless such discussion is accompa
nied by an exaltation of the straight lifestyle. 
This might lead to question what exactly he 
does tolerate. Perhaps the only homosexu
als that he tolerates are those who are nei
ther seen nor heard.

Ignorance depicts hatred
Editor,
Jeff Cullerss editorial,Gay agenda goes 
too far, is a perfect example of why it is so 
important to teach children about gays. His 
article was rife with the misconceptions and 
ignorance that lead to bigotry and violence 
against gays. I suspect that Cullers spent 
more time reading the propaganda from 
organizations like the American Family 
Association or the Traditional Values 
Coalition than he did looking at the GLSEN 
webpages.
Cullers repeats the incorrect assumption 
that being gay isnt normal. Being gay is nor
mal, just as normal as being left-handed or 
having blue eyes. His article implies that 
being gay is just about sexual practices that 
he finds distasteful. This implication is also 
incorrect. Gay relationships can encompass 
both physical and emotional aspects, just as 
straight relationships do. Same-gender cou
ples deal with the same concerns about 
things like finances, health care, and schools 
that opposite-gender couples do.
Another argument Cullers uses is the 
moral and religious objections to homo
sexuality. However, many people had 
moral and religious objections to abolish
ing slavery. Many people had moral and 
religious objections to allowing women to 
vote. Many people had moral and religious 
objections to allowing inter-racial mar
riages. The cloak of moral and religious 
objections has worn a bit thin and trying to 
hide ignorance and bigotry behind it doesnt 
work as well as it used to.
Cullers is right when he says that fiveyear-olds dont use the word homosexuality. 
However, they do use the word gay, usually 
as in thats so gay or youre gay. They use 
the word with no understanding of what it 
means other than to assume that gay is 
bad. Its an assumption that only gets rein
forced as time goes on, where by middle and 
high school it can escalate into daily verbal 
and physical harassment of gay teens, 
harassment that is all too often ignored by 
teachers and administrators. Also, this con
tinuous reinforcement of negative attitudes 
toward gays has a detrimental impact on 
adolescents who realize they are gay them
selves. The realization that they are one of 
these bad people theyve been denigrating 
for years contributes to the high rate of sui
cide among gay youths. These are the major 
problems GLSEN, PFLAG, and other such 
groups are trying to solve. If Cullers had 
bothered to look past his own prejudices and 
actually studied the issues, he wouldve real
ized what GLSEN is doing. Instead he simply 
chose to spew out a bunch of nonsense on a 
topic he obviously knows little about.

Inculcating kids too soon
Editor,
I personally have a few friends who are 
gay, and I do not believe that it is always the 
choice of the individual; however, I am 
appalled to discover that young children are

finding these things out so early. Whatever 
happened to innocence? Is there even any 
proof that learning about homosexuality at 
a young age is helping to reduce the number 
of anti-gays at an older age? I agree with Mr. 
Cullers that my children should hear about 
tolerance from me. I believe in tolerance of 
all people, but in no way should the public 
school system assume that I am not capable 
of properly raising my own child. I know 
that I will be a capable mother, and it is sad 
that so many are believed to not be.
The fact that taxpayers are paying for 
public school education must also not be 
dismissed. Is it right that I should have to 
pay for programs that, in my opinion, hinder 
the growth and development of my chil
dren? Is it important that everyone learns 
tolerance for all religions, sexual orienta? 
tions, and values? I would say definitely but 
only when the time is right.
I have been a member of ALLIES, the oncampus group whose goal is to express tol
erance for all types of people, for about one 
year. The fact of the matter is the GLSEN is 
not showing tolerance of the views 
expressed by parents with respect to their 
offspring.
I would like to thank Mr. Cullers for shed
ding this light. Hopefully the school system 
will see the negative effects that these 
talks may have on some children. I know 
that I would be confused at that agei 
Everyone goes through the stage of hatred 
for the opposite sex and, of course,

Library is improving
Editor,
Monica Datta makes several valid points 
in CMU ignores classical education as 
library suffers (v. 97, i. 2, 9/9/02). When 
Andrew Carnegie founded Carnegie Tech in 
1900 to provide an education for factory 
workers children, he expected these trade 
school students to use the Carnegie Library 
of Pittsburgh near campus. Carnegie Tech 
was slow to develop its own library, and the 
current cost of a 1.5 to 2 million volume col
lection would have been 80 to 100 million 
dollars, which was needed elsewhere. Thus, 
the strategic choice of Carnegie Mellon 
University has been to continue to rely on 
the Carnegie Library, the University of 
Pittsburgh libraries, and others through 
inter-library loans rather than to build a selfsufficient, comprehensive collection.
Students are less satisfied with the library 
than they are with the rest of the university. 
A 1999 survey reported a 66 percent satisr 
faction rate for libraries as compared with 
an 88 percent approval rating for the univer
sity as a whole. The Libraries are working to 
improve all of these areas:
 This fall, we will add our one millionth 
volume, WH1aA RiAH-NEAndm an 1893 book of 
essays and poetry. The Carnegie UK Trust 
donated Carnegies own copy to the 
libraries.
tNN-K449EHl wH1AIAMm adnl a9n4YJlYY034ofWf4 
J3Ybj(j
) In the last four years, we have raised over 
$300,000 to address deficiencies in under
graduate collections.
 Several gifts from donors have paid for 
renovations and new furniture on the first 
and third floors of Hunt Library, in the 
Engineering and Science Library, and in 
Mellon Institute.
 The Million Book digitization project will 
allow us to add our second million volumes 
in about five years, rather than the 102 it 
took to gather our first million volumes. 
Carnegie Mellon and other students world
wide can use digital volumes from their lap
tops anywhere, anytime: nwliplidnla9nl
Andrew Carnegie certainly thought that 
libraries helped individuals to advance 
themselves, as the hundreds of library build
ings he funded indicate. Friendly and 
knowledgeable staff at Carnegie Mellon 
Libraries maximize available resources, pro
viding highly-ranked reference and interlibrary loan services to the community. 
Users who come to the library and/or con
sult with librarians both improve the quality 
of their research and reduce the time it takes 
to do it.

Neoprohibition gone mad
PNpaHeaht yGHeacr
Im sorry, but I just cant do it anymore. Nope. No way. Aint gonna 
happen. In the words of Bush Sr., it just wouldnt be prudent. You may 
think me a cruel person, but I refuse to consider Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD) an organization that does good.
When it first started out, MADD did indeed, and to some extent still 
does, achieve a needed social good. Since MADDs formation in 1980, 
the number of alcohol-related deaths in car crashes has fallen dramati
cally. In 1990, a little over 20,000 people died in these accidents. In 
2000, the number was 16,653. The portion of fatal accidents involving 
alcohol fell from 40 to 31 percent. I have two small children and drive a 
great deal for my job, so Im happy that fewer drunk drivers are on the 
road.However, MADD now engages in a form of neoprohibition. MADD is 
no longer concerned only with blood alcohol content (BAC) limits or 
stricter laws against drunk drivers, but now advocates higher alcohol 
taxes and keg registrations, restrictions on when and how alcohol can 
be served, and ridiculous standards for advertising. All of this would 
make it harder for responsible adults to purchase and consume alcohol, 
and it would severely curtail the rights of businesses to operate in the 
marketplace.
MADD offers the solution of higher alcohol taxes to help limit under
age drinking. For the most part, teenagers have less money than adults 
and tend to be more price-sensitive to alcohol prices. But should we 
really punish adults with higher taxes? Thats essentially what the tax 
would be: a punitive tax on those who are old enough to drink to pay for 
the illegal actions of those who are too young to legally imbibe.
I think a far better solution would be to better enforce underage 
drinking laws. Despite the corny commercials, Pennsylvania achieved 
success with its compliance checks for tobacco. Under this program, 
teenage volunteers attempted to buy tobacco products from vendors. 
Why not do more of the same with beer distributors and state liquor 
stores?
The suggestion for higher alcohol taxes also fails to address an impor
tant issue, namely, how high would one have to raise taxes? And if one 
did raise them significantly, would some manufacturers respond with 
lower prices to maintain demand?
Legalize marijuana, a perfectly valid drug
.aGSo w/LaGN$e2 P2Lmm
: I find keg registration particularly draconian, even though many 
places already collect your name and a deposit in case you decide not to 
return the keg. However, under MADDs intent, such information would 
help in finding out who purchases alcohol while underage or gives it 
to a minor. Consider it government monitoring of your personal drink
ing habits. Of course, one can always walk into a beer distributor in 
Pennsylvania, buy five cases of Natural Light, pay cash, and walk out the 
door without providing any more information than five cases of 
Natural Light, please.
MADD also wants to eliminate such events as happy hours and dis
count drinks at bars and hotels. While the claim that they promote extra 
drinking may certainly be true, dont we have laws against drunk driving? Designated driver programs are ubiquitous, and many states have 
laws holding servers liable if they serve a visibly intoxicated patron. 
Never mind the fact that most people who drink in hotel bars are hotel 
patrons wholl be sleeping at the hotel that night. Ive seen no evidence 
from MADD that such restrictions would reduce drunk driving.
Perhaps the most ludicrous of all MADDs neoprohibitionist stands is 
the one regarding alcohol advertising. Some of MADDs ideas are rea
sonable: not portraying underage drinking or drinking by pregnant 
women. Such images would market a patently illegal activity and a 
behavior with a serious proven health threat, respectively.
Other standards, however, border on being incredibly naive. For 
example, MADD feels that alcohol advertisers should not advertise in 
broadcast mediums unless 90 percent of the audience is over the age of 
21.1 challenge anyone reading this column to find any such show or pro
gram. They simply do not exist. Even a 19-year-old can watch the Spice 
channel, and I doubt anyone watching an adult film wants to be inter
rupted by the Budweiser frogs.
MADD also believes that actors or spokespeople should not be under 
the age of 30, appeal to youth in any way, or have anything to do with 
music, sports, or the like that may attract young people. These stan
dards would essentially ban all alcohol advertising.
MADD also wants equal time to be paid by the government or a non
profit organization (funded in part, Im sure, by higher alcohol taxes). 
This time would be used for public health issues related to alcohol. The 
inherent message behind this equal time policy, of course, is that alco
hol is bad.
Drunk driving is obviously a problem in our society, and MADD has 
played an important role in fighting it. Even though I dont agree with 
MADDs 0.08 BAC campaign to reduce the legally drunk limit in states, 
I am glad they at least attempt to offer some evidence in support of this 
position. But some of their positions paint them as anti-alcohol, not 
nti-drunk driving. If they keep this up, theyll run the risk of alienating 
a large portion of the population: the social drinkers who know how to 
act responsibly and support many of MADDs drunk driving goals.

Kafka once called America a land of 
laws poorly written and randomly 
enforced. Im inclined to agree with 
him. For instance, in Las Cruces, New 
Mexico, one can be cited for carrying a 
lunchbox down main street. California 
has a law on the books that deprives 
animals of the chance to mate publicly 
within 1,500 feet of a tavern, school, 
or place of worship. And right here in 
Pennsylvania, it is illegal to sleep on 
top of a refrigerator outdoors or to 
become governor if youve participat
ed in a duel. You can look it up.
Granted, these outrageous statutes 
are rarely, if ever, enforced. 
Nevertheless, theyre indicative of a 
slew of antiquated laws that are still 
hanging around. And while these are 
relatively benign examples of state 
laws, there remains a federal mandate 
that is no less atavistic, unnecessary, 
and senseless: the prohibition of mari
juana.
This is a touchy issue for many peo
ple. There are scores of opinions, 
angles, and prejudices swirling around 
drug use, as it tends to be a subject that 
people  one way or another  feel 
very strongly about. That said, I urge 
those of you out there who uniformly 
refuse to entertain the notion of legal
izing dangerous drugs to keep reading. 
You just might learn something.
Im a pretty angry person on most 
days. I dont know what it is. Im just 
generally pissy and antagonistic. The 
fuse is short. So what do I do? I spend 
a few hours of every week laying rage 
out on paper for others to read in some 
weak attempt to cathartically dispel all 
of that heinous stuff. I rant and I rave, 
and I bitch and I moan, and every once 
in a while, I feel better because of it.
Not this week. Ive spent the last four 
days reading through countless arti
cles, essays, medical journal excerpts, 
news-clippings, websites, speeches 
and interviews concerning the decrim
inalization of marijuana and all its 
done is piss me the hell off.
Im really Peking angry here.
Before I get to the logical construc
tive criticism here, let me get a few 
things out in the air for those of you 
who dont keep an eye on the dope cul
ture. Im speaking mostly to politicians 
and older people here.
On September 17, federal agents 
kicked down the door of Santa Cruz 
resident Suzanne Pfeil. They hand
cuffed her and ordered her to stand up 
on her bed, even after noticing the 
crutches and leg braces next to the 
bed. Suzanne, 42, is disabled by polio. 
She uses marijuana medicinally. DEA 
administrator Asa Hutchinson defend.aGSo w/LaGN$e2 P2Lmm
ed the raid, saying, Someone could 
stand up and say one of these marijua
na plants is designed for someone who 
is sick, but under federal law, theres 
no distinction. As usual, its good to 
see our government putting its own 
prejudices and BS agendas ahead of 
the well-being of its citizens.
For those of you unaware, California 
voters approved use of medical mari
juana in 1996. Alaska, Arizona, 
Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, 
Oregon, and Washington have all fol
lowed suit, enacting similar laws. The 
federal government has roundly reject
ed the validity of these actions, despite 
the fact that their mere existence 
demonstrates that millions of voting 
citizens have made their decision.
See MARIJUANA, page A10
Its a no-brainer: gays should be able to adopt
Robyn Murphy
Half a million children live in foster 
homes today and 100,000 are in criti
cal need of adoption, according to 
information from the Child Welfare 
League of America (CWLA). Annually, 
however, the number of screened 
adoptive parents can only absorb 
20,000 of these children into stable 
homes, and often the ones in greatest 
need, those suffering from debilitating 
or life-threatening illnesses, are the 
ones least likely to find parents. Many 
more children could find homes if not 
for the fact that thousands of fullyqualified adults are turned away solely 
because of their sexual orientation. 
Ignorance and old stigmas in many 
states are preventing adoption by les
bian and gay couples.
Eleven states, including 
Pennsylvania have laws that allow 
homosexuals to adopt, while Florida is 
the only state with a statute that 
explicitly prohibits gay and lesbian 
adoption. The rest of the states lack 
specific legislation, and so swing from 
welcoming to hostile depending on 
local counties and judges. Those states 
that have opened adoption for all 
adults, regardless of sexual orientation 
or marital status, should be applaud
ed, while those that continue to cling 
to prejudices and myths deserve noth
ing but scorn. When the American 
Academy of Pediatrics and the 
American Psychological Association 
declared that gay couples can provide 
a stable, nourishing, and loving envi
ronment for children, it should have 
been a sign to opponents that times 
were changing. Instead, groups such 
as Focus on the Family (FOTF) merely 
redoubled their efforts to permanently 
block lesbian and gay adoption.
FOTF opines that children raised in
a household with single-sex parents 
will grow up to be gay. How then, 
pray tell, would that explain why chil
dren raised in a purely traditional het
erosexual environment were then 
attracted to members of their own sex? 
According to studies by the American 
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), this is 
simply untrue. Sexuality is not a 
lifestyle choice, but a biological predis
position, and people cannot change 
the way they were born. Having two 
mommies will not make Heather a les
bian any more than having one 
mommy would send her down the 
straight and narrow.
Vast ignorance leads many people to 
ask the following question: Wont gay 
parents molest young boys? This 
ignores the simple fact that there is 
absolutely no connection between 
homosexuality and pedophilia. In fact,
$aaLStUL PV/LlmleNwOKo P2Lmm
according to the CWLA, 90 percent of 
child molestation is committed by het
erosexual men. In cases where the 
molestation was of a boy by a man, 74 
percent of those men were in a hetero
sexual relationship with the boys 
mother. One would assume that the 
gut reaction to these statistics would 
be to actively encourage gay adoption 
 it certainly seems safer.
Then theres always the fun idea 
that having gay or lesbian parents will 
cause children to be ostracized, 
harassed, and picked on by their peers. 
Simply put  of course it will. Then 
again, so will having parents who are 
divorced. Or parents who wear match
ing outfits. Children will be picked on 
if they are tall or short, or if their hair 
is curly, or if it is straight. Wearing

Exposed genitals bring mirth 
and excitement to the masses
Michael Croland
Most stark naked, 16'5" men living 
in oft-visited museums would be 
rather embarrassed if they went over 
a century without bathing. 
Accordingly, Michelangelos David 
began a long overdue six-month pro
cedure last week, his first washing 
since 1873. Having dirty genitals 
exposed is uncomfortable, disgust
ing, and inappropriate for young 
passersby.
It would be unreasonable to take a 
stance that statues with exposed gen
itals need to have frequent cleanings 
io and claim it as an urgent matter. 
Rather, I just appreciate real news 
that can stir up a good laugh. Before 
branching out into other tangents, 
 lets ingest the beauty of this story.
David, a masterpiece of sculpture, 
is one of the most heralded works of 
art from the Renaissance. His true-tolife form, constructed from a single 
piece of marble, exhibits even his pri
vate parts. Today, though, much 
focus and humor are being given to 
his ears. As part of the overall process 
which will be conducted after-hours, 
the ears will be cleaned by cotton 
swabs attached to longer poles. This 
entire endeavor, sponsored mostly by 
a Dutch nonprofit organization, has 
been planned for 11 years! The funni
est part, though, is that the changes 
will not even be noticeable to the 
naked eye, as Franca Falletti, the
director of Florences Galleria 
dellAccademia, told the Associated 
Press.
As an equal opportunist, Im elated 
that David is still so prominent. 
Pornography runs rampant in our 
society, and nudity is ubiquitous in 
film and television. However, this 
nudity is generally very one-sided in 
exposing and degrading women. 
Full-frontal male nudity might not be 
anything I desire to witness, but that 
it remains available in such a classic 
and revered manner is a step towards 
abolishing discrimination between 
the sexes. Indeed, equality can be 
achieved through voyeurism.
Traditional Italian art should also 
be juxtaposed with obscure 
Paraguayan mythology. The truly cul
tured person cannot help but draw 
parallels between David and Kurupi. 
Although the mythological troll is 
feared and abhorred, statues of 
Kurupi are a unique consumer prod
uct of Paraguay. Kurupi is dreaded for 
his fondness of raping young women 
in the forest late at night. His trade
mark is a gargantuan penis that he 
wraps several times around his waist. 
So long as it doesnt inspire more sex
ual assaults at Carnegie Mellon and 
elsewhere, the United States can 
learn a lot from absorbing full-frontal 
nudity into its culture.
Rape is by no means a humorous 
topic, but the absurdity of Davids 
bath and Kurupis hijinks certainly 
can be seen in a light tone. For the 
sake of equality between the sexes, 
we should implement more fullfrontal male nudity, or at least curb 
the inherent misogyny of chiefly
exposing women. Most of all, in our 
world, which features so much 
bad news, lets appreciate the 
positive, the funny, and the 
downright ludicrous that 
current events and lin
gering culture offer.

MARIJUANA, from page A9
Weve told our elected representatives 
what we want and they have ignored 
us. I may not be crystal clear on this 
whole democracy thing here, but 
Im pretty sure the government is 
expected to pay attention to the views 
and ambitions of its citizens.
Despite DEA scare tactics and 
harassment, citizens have taken it 
upon themselves to fight back against 
this worthless insult of a law. It seems 
outweighed by the potential benefits 
of that law one day being overturned. 
For instance, on September 15, 
35,000 advocates gathered in Boston 
Common for the 13th annual Freedom 
Rally. So many people showed up that 
the T had to add extra trains.
Last Tuesday, the Santa Cruz mayor 
and city council  in the biggest dis
play of backbone and respect for 
democracy Ive seen in a good while 
 passed out marijuana to ill resi
dents of the town on the steps of City 
Hall. Small non-profit growers have 
sprung up all over California, offering 
weed to the sick at cost. And the DEA 
has been nothing if not persistent in its 
efforts to shut down these grow hous
es.
The Santa Cruz demonstration was 
held in reaction to a raid conducted on 
Valerie Corral, a founder of the medi
cinal marijuana cooperative, and her 
husband, Michael, wherein federal 
agents seized 167 plants before arrest
ing the two of them. The Corrals, who 
distribute their pot to AIDS and cancer 
patients, were instrumental in the cre
ation of Proposition 215, the 1996 bal
lot initiative that marked the first 
approved medicinal marijuana policy 
in this countrys history.
The Corrals had been working in 
conjunction with local government 
and police forces. The Santa Cruz 
County sheriff said he was disap
pointed with the raid. Even 
California Attorney General Bill 
Lockyer called the bust a waste of law 
enforcement resources, and a slap at 
the states voters.
Local law enforcement agencies in 
several cities have encouraged the 
decriminalization of marijuana. Its 
too much of a strain. Hell, marijuana
arrests outnumber those for murder,AER Drape, robbery, and aggravated assault 
combined. Every time an officer has to 
bust someone for the violation of thlis 
BS law, it takes him off the streets.'
The 60,000 American citizens 
behind bars for marijuana violations
 88 percent of which are for simple 
possession  cost taxpayers an esti
mated $1.2 billion every year. On top 
of that is the $7.5 billion allotted for 
arresting and $10 billion damage for 
prosecuting these offenders.
Im out of space and patience, tso 
thisll have to do for now. The sun Has 
just broken over the horizon, and five 
got drinking to do tonight. But tlis 
isnt finished. Ive just given you a little 
to nibble on. Tune in next week for 
more happy Nazi fun.
Penalties against drug use should not 
be more damaging to an individual 
than the use of the drug itself. 
Nowhere is this more clear that in the 
laws against the possession of mari
juana in private for personal use.

Willing parents deserve adoption eligibility
ADOPTION, from page A9 on a hamburger has eaten a reincarnated soul, not to men
tion annoyed Oprah. Dozens of religions would probably 
agree that every Real World cast member is going to hell. 
And the Amish have moral superiority over everyone who 
owns a wristwatch.
Myths, stereotypes, misinformation, and simple bigotry 
have caused a great deal of pain to many children who 
have been robbed of parents who wouldve been eager to 
give them a safe and loving home. FOTF pushes its agen
da, which includes a father and a mother for each child, 
even to the point of denouncing mothers who choose to 
raise their children as single parents. A better goal for 
today would be for each child to have at least one devoted 
adult, of either gender or sexual preference, who was will
ing to face up to the challenges and sacrifices of being a 
parent.
what is perceived as a dorky piece of clothing can bring 
the full hell of prepubescent cruelty down onto a child for 
years on end. At least with parents (straight or gay) there 
will be a supportive environment for the child to come 
back to after a day of peer scorn. Isnt that preferable to 
returning home to an overfull foster home that is meant to 
only be a transitory home on the path to adoption?
Its also extremely important to remember the wonder
ful immorality charge that everyone loves to level. 
Guess what  everyone, everywhere, is doing something 
that someone else considers immoral. People lined up at 
the espresso machines would never make it in Salt Lake 
City. Heterosexual couples who drive on the right side of 
the road, recycle, and happen to be atheists would be in 
big trouble with the Religious Right. That ham a few of 
you had for dinner the other night? Definitely not kosher. 
The Pope is pretty disapproving of everyone who bought a 
pack of Trojans last Saturday. Anyone who ever munched

' denotes away game
A black and 
gold prayer
PrAat xrAAr,hB
Well it is week two of my column, 
and already I have discovered how 
! hard it is to write about football for a 
paper that comes out on Mondays. 
How can I tell you what games to 
watch when they happened the day 
before? I suppose I can call the 
Monday night game, but that is only 
I one out of so many.
| Incidentally, I pick Tampa Bay to 
j be the first victims of the hated Rams 
1 this Monday night in Florida. The 
i Bucs will put up quite a fight, but I 
"Think St. Louis walks away with this 
Tone. Anyway, back to my point.
This whole football column thing 
is hard. There are so many things 
that I can say, but that will be irrele
vant by the time you read this. You 
' are probably reading this on 
1 Tuesday, knowing my luck, making 
I my prognostication even more usej less. Yeah, its tough.
Ive decided it is even tougher, 
j however, to be a Steelers fan right 
i now. The team is a woeful 0-2, and 
i hardly living up to its potential. I 
! can remember while growing up my 
mom always taught me that when 
things were hard for me to think of 
someone who had it worse than I did 
and walk a mile in their shoes.
While I dont have any desire to walk 
a Pittsburgh mile (or any distance for 
that matter), I did put myself in the 
position of Steelers fans. I really feel 
for them, and have decided that the 
only thing that can save their 
beloved Steelers is a prayer. Being 
that Im such a nice guy I took the 
1 liberty to write it for them:
[ God, first off just let me say thank 
7 you for the man who decided to put 
j coleslaw and french fries on a sandi wich, may he serve the holy host for 
i all eternity. Now Lord, the business 
7 at hand. Im sorry for skipping 
J. church to go watch the Steelers, but I 
7 know you understand (even though 
Im convinced you are a Patriots fan). 
Dear God, Im not a praying man, 
once I get down to my knees I have 
trouble picking myself up again, but 
for my team it is worth it. They are 
awful, Lord. They cant defend the 
pass, and opposing offenses figure 
this out and abandon the run. God, 
if you could make their blitzing 
schemes work again, Ill promise not 
, to cheer when the other teams quar| terback gets hurt. Well, not too 
[ loudly, anyway. I promise not to 
stand up at least.
Now, Lord, about that offense. If 
i you could bless Kordell Stewart with 
i the knowledge that he is not a good 
7 quarterback, that would be appreci
ated. And if you could plant the seed 
in his head that it would be for the 
good of the team if he just quit foot
ball altogether and worked at the 
O at Carnegie Mellon, I would like 
that, too. If that isnt possible, God, 
could you maybe break something 
important? Like a wrist or perhaps 
two or three toes. Nothing too 
painful, but something that will side
line him long enough for Coach 
Cowher to see that Tommy Maddox 
is so much better (I estimate this 
should only take one game, but just 
in case, you should break the wrist). 
He has good receivers, some of the 
best in the league, and a running 
game that can lead us to a champi
onship. He just chokes too much,
; and can never be the quarterback to 
; take us back to the big game. Please 
1 fix this situation before Bill Cowher 
i kills him, and we lose our coach.
! And God, since Im doing this, I 
7 figured Id take the opportunity to 
[ thank you for our division. We will 
' make the playoffs regardless of our 
ineptitude as we are matched up 
against Baltimore who couldnt score 
if their life depended on it, Cleveland 
who I know you hate because Ive 
been to that city, and Cincinatti who 
hasnt had a winning record since all 
my arteries functioned properly.
Just the same, God, Id like to see the 
Black and Gold do well in the post
season, so please help. I promise I 
wont claim I saw your face in a large 
fry at the O anymore, and to stop 
drinking beer before noon on 
Tuesdays. Ill throw in Wednesdays if 
we win the Super Bowl.
Thank you again Lord, and in your 
name I pray the prayer I learned 
when I was drunk last Tuesday 
morning at Phi Bar.

Turnovers plague offense in Tartans' suprising 17-14 defeat
STUNG, from page A14
We just didnt show up to play today, said 
nose guard Brian Smalley. We gave them the 
game.
The rushing attack, led by halfback Ricardo 
Clarke and fullback Adam Urbanczyk account
ed for the few positives in an otherwise disap
pointing day for CMU. The junior-senior duo 
racked up 226 yards on the ground and two 
touchdowns. The rest of the Tartans offense 
added only 41 total yards.
The Tartans drew first blood, scoring on an 
Urbanczyk 1-yard run with 3:29 remaining in 
the first quarter. The Tartans, who appeared 
buoyed by the early lead, looked to parlay the 
momentum into a performance reminiscent of 
last years 40-0 dismantling of the Yellow 
Jackets.
However, CMU hopes would sour when
Randolph-Macon responded with 17 consecu
tive points.
The first score for the Yellow Jackets came 
when defensive back Chris Headrick recovered 
senior Drew Garrods fumble and galloped 72 
yards for the touchdown.
Fumbles continued to plague the Tartans, 
who produced three more following the 
Headrick recovery.
Looking forward to next weeks contest at 
Johns Hopkins University and looking back on a 
mistake-ridden day, Carnegie Mellon head 
coach Rich Lackner noted that the Tartans 
have to hold onto the ball better. Additionally, 
Lackner pointed to shoring up the kicking game 
as a concern. Bottom line, however, is that the 
Tartans need to hang onto the ball.
If Carnegie Mellon relied on a ground attack 
against the Yellow Jackets, Randolph-Macon 
countered through the air. RMC quarterback
Price threw for 153 yards and one touchdown, 
while setting the new Randolph-Macon record 
for career passing attempts. Price completed a 
19-yard pass to receiver Victor Wise on a fade 
route to end the first half and put the Yellow 
Jackets out in front, 14-7.
The story for the Carnegie Mellon passing 
offense in the second half of play differed little 
from the first. Tartan QB Sebastian Smelko, 
questionable as of game time because of a nag
ging rib injury, was unproductive in his role as 
CMUs starter. Smelko completed only one pass 
in his six attempts and was spelled in the third 
quarter by backup quarterback Michael 
Wykosky, who fared little better. Wykosky 
threw two interceptions, returned for a total of 
32 yards by Randolph-Macon defenders.
The fourth quarter saw the appearance of 
junior Robb Finkey in a substitution and a 
chance to save the game for the harried
Tartans. Referring to the decision to bench 
Wykosky in favor of Finkey, Lackner cited per
formance. We felt it was time to give some
body else a shot.
On a crucial drive within Yellow Jackets ter
ritory, the seconds and the Tartan hopes for a 
victory quickly falling away, running back 
Ricardo Clarke dopped a pass from Chris 
Finkey at the ten yard line as he slowed up with 
Yellow Jackets cornerback Tyrone Noel shad
owing him stride for stride. A final, desperate 
shot on a fourth-and-five went equally bad 
when Finkey fumbled the ball on a botched 
handoff to fullback Adam Urbanczyk.
Asked if the team should have fared better 
against a markedly inferior opponent, Lackner 
was forthright. Absolutely, the coach said. 
This was one of those few games where we 
feel like we gave it away. We flat-out put them 
in a position to win.
Playoff races in American League becoming clearer
MLB, from page A14
ERA (Rick Reed is 13th at 3.71).
Conversely, the other playoff-bound teams 
boast a combined eight in the top 20.
Minnesotas upcoming opponent, on the 
other hand, boasts three of the best pitchers 
in either league. Barry Zito, Tim Hudson, 
and Mark Mulder all rank in the top 10 in 
ERA and a combined 54 wins. Zito has been 
the best of the bunch, with 22 wins and an 
ERA of 2.74, and a playoff schedule with 
extra rest days will allow him to start games 
one and five (if necessary) on normal rest.
The Twins actually compare favorably on 
offense, with a higher team batting aver
age, nearly identical on-base percentage 
(.333 to Oaklands .338), and have scored 
only 16 fewer runs. Great pitching always 
beats good hitting, though, and Oakland 
has been on fire since the All-Star Break, 
riding a 48-19 record to the best overall 
record in the majors (the Yankees and 
Braves are keeping pace, however).
Oakland should cruise, dispatching the 
Twins in at most four games.
Those looking for more excitement from 
a first-round series have no further to go 
than the other AL match-up between the 
Yankees and Angels. The Yankees are mak
ing their annual October appearance, while 
the Angels have come out of nowhere (most 
pre-season predictions put them no better 
than third in the division) to play the best
second-half ball outside of Oakland (45-24 
since the break).
While the Angels have rolled, the 
Yankees are showing signs of weakness. 
Despite competing with Oakland for the 
best overall record, New York has had some 
chinks in the armor, especially in their 
pitching. Only two Yankee pitchers rank in 
the top 20 in ERA (Anaheim has three), and 
their high win totals cover up disturbingly 
shaky performances. Former ace Roger 
Clemens has only 13 wins and an ERA over 
four and Mike Mussinas 16 wins come in 
spite of a 4.33 ERA. The only other starter 
to rank near the top, David Wells, is not 
much better (17 wins, 3.93 ERA), Mussina, 
in particular, has struggled of late, going 
4-7 since the All-Star game and generally 
not looking sharp.
Also of concern for the Yankees is the 
health of closer Mariano Rivera. Rivera was 
held out for most of September to ensure 
complete recovery of a shoulder injury 
which kept him out of the lineup for two 
separate stretches this year. If he isnt his 
usual dominant self, the Yankees bullpen 
could struggle.
The Angels staff, though, isnt noticeably 
better, with the exception of Jarrod 
Washburn, who leads both teams with 18 
wins and an ERA of 3.11. Anaheim also has 
the edge in team batting average, but the 
Yankees lead in runs and on-base percent
age. Defensively, the Angels have been
much better, trailing only Minnesota in 
fielding percentage, while the Yankees rank 
13th.
Overall, neither team has a clear edge in 
any statistical category. Having hardly 
played each other in the regular season 
(the Yankees won the season series 4-3), 
neither will have a definite plan on how to 
shut down the other, as well. This series 
should be hard-fought and come down to 
the intangibles. The Angels are hotter than 
any team besides Oakland, and will be 
eager for a good showing in their first play
off appearance since 86. Itll be close, but I 
like the Angels in five to set up a Western 
division showdown in the American League 
Championship Series.
Continuing the theme of the AnaheimNew York series, an Anaheim-Oakland 
ALCS will be an absolute war. Oakland 
claimed a slim edge in the season series, 
11-9, and home field could play a big role 
as Anaheim went just 3-7 at Oaldand this 
year. A long series against New York will 
hurt the Angels chances, especially since 
Oaklands big three should be well rested. If 
were lucky, this great match-up will go the 
distance, with Oakland moving on to the 
World Series.

Whos Next: Carnegie Mellon (2-1) at Johns Hopkins 
University (2-0) 1 pm, Saturday, September 28 on 
WRCT, 88.3 FM.
Last Meeting: These teams have not met since 1969, 
when the Tartans shut out the Blue Jays 42-0. This will 
be the eighth meeting ever between the two teams, with 
the Tartans owning the series with a 6-1 record. The 
last time the Blue Jays beat the Tartans, Richard Nixon 
was in office.
The Skinny: The Tartans are coming off a disappointing 
17-14 loss to a weaker Randolph-Macon team, while the 
Blue Jays are 2-0 after a convincing 41-28 victory over 
Rochester. The Tartans need to cut down on their 
turnovers and make fewer mistakes if they hope to 
rebound from last weeks loss.
Watch For: The quarterback situation. Last week the 
Tartans used three different quarterbacks and as a result
the offense never really found much of a flow against 
Randolph-Macon. Starter Sebastian Smelkos health was 
in question all day, and backup QB Jeff Wykosky simply 
looked bad, throwing two interceptions over the middle. 
None of the QBs were really helped by receivers either, 
as junior halfback Ricardo Clarke dropped a Robb 
Finkey pass on the final drive which would have given 
the Tartans a first and goal.
Result: This is a good Johns Hopkins team that will 
catch the Tartans on their third straight road game. 
Combine that with the fact that the Tartans have made 
too many mistakes the last two games, and Carnegie 
Mellon could end up losing their second straight game. 
Johns Hopkins 21, Carnegie Mellon 17.
Team Notes: Against Randolph-Macon, starting cornerback Ryan McMillen did not play due to a hamstring 
injury. However, senior cornerback Nick Cecchini came 
in and played an outstanding game making many big 
plays. Johns Hopkins has started out 2-0 in five out of 
their last six seasons.
After tragedy: baseball 
begins to look forward
by Tristan Hoffmann
R-EANp U9HNEA
While looking back in somber 
remembrance of a fallen team
mate, the baseball team is also 
looking forward to what could be 
the beginning of a new era. The 
teams talent pool is its deepest 
ever and their push for varsity sta
tus is making headway.
Sophomore Patrick Purpera 
played outfield and pitched for the 
baseball team. Finished with the 
spring semester, Purpera was 
headed home when he was killed 
in a car accident.
The team will honor him this 
season by wearing a sticker with 
his number, 14, on their helmets. 
They also will pay tribute to his jer
sey at an upcoming home game (to 
be announced).
Patrick just wanted to be the 
best player he could be, said head 
coach Rich Grieser. He was look
ing forward to being one of our 
main pitchers this year. On top of 
that, he really could put on a show 
from the outfield with his arm. He 
surprised a lot of guys trying to 
steal on his cannon out there. Also, 
he was a hard worker who was 
pushing hard for the team to go 
varsity.
He had such passion for the 
team, said team captain Dan 
Bogard. He would call home, and 
all hed talk about was trying to 
make baseball varsity.
Despite the loss, the team is 
excited about the turnout and the 
talent as it gears up for the upcom
ing fall season. Although the team 
is prohibited from recruiting and 
despite the fact that they lose play
ers to other UAA schools with var
sity programs, the squad has 
picked up seven first-years and a 
few upperclassmen.
While their roster is officially 20 
players, they really have a turnout 
of about 25. Its a significant task 
for the coach and team captains
who organize the four hour 
Saturday and Sunday practices and 
the two hour night sessions held 
four nights a week.
The commitment of the fresh
men has been incredible, said 
Bogard. Even when we took the 
Fence for the activities fair, they 
were there pretty much the entire 
time.
Adding this kind of talent to a 
mix that already includes career 
.400 hitters and a pitcher that has 
thrown a no-hitter, the team thinks 
it is ready to take on the toughest of 
competition.
But who will face them? Without 
varsity status, the team is still 
forced to play with club status. 
However, a solution may be in 
sight, says the administration. 
They will permit alumni to donate 
directly to the teams varsity effort.
The team tried to convince the 
UAA to let them play in the UAA 
Championships this spring, but the 
other UAA directors would not let 
them participate, citing many rea
sons, including the fact that the 
winner of the tournament gets an 
automatic Division III NCAA play
off berth. Despite the rejection, the 
coach is currently working out an 
opportunity to play Rochester 
sometime this fall, possibly as early 
as this weekend. This would be the 
teams first ever game against a 
UAA opponent.
We have so much talent, we 
really want good competition, 
said Bogard. Its tough when 
youre beating varsity teams, 
because they dont want to play 
you again to taint their pride.
Regardless of whos on their 
schedule, this team is just looking 
forward to getting out and playing 
the game they love. And while they 
do, they will have an extra specta
tor cheering them on from beyond.
If Patrick was still with us, said 
coach Greiser, I know hed be 
happy today with the increase in 
talent and with the things going on 
with the team.

A series of missteps and botched 
plays led to the defeat of the Carnegie 
Mellon football team Saturday in 
Ashland, Virginia, 17-14. The Yellow 
Jackets of Randolph-Macon College 
capitalized on turnovers and an ane
mic passing attack to secure the victo
ry at Day Field. The Tartans, losing 
their first game of the season, com
mitted six turnovers, four on fumbles, 
in a day that was beset by gaffes and 
poor performance. The Yellow 
Jackets, meanwhile, improved their 
record to 2-1 on the arm of RMC 
quarterback Hunter Price and a few 
gimmes provided by the Tartans 
inconsistent offense.

Post-season 
coming into 
focus in AL
RRgee 2Wat
With the Yankees clinching their 
fifth consecutive American League 
Eastern division crown last week and 
the Athletics beginning to pull away 
in the West, the AL playoff picture is 
just about set. Yes, Anaheim could 
catch Oakland and switch the firstround match-ups, but Oaklands 
remaining schedule (six games 
against the woeful Rangers) is light 
enough that they should hang on. 
Thus, this week brings the AL playoff 
preview, with the NL edition to fol
low next week when the Wild Card 
should be decided (barring a playoff 
between the Giants and Dodgers).
Assuming that the As hold on to 
their lead through their final seven 
games, theyll earn the right to host 
the Central Division champion 
Twins. This is a match-up that plays 
right into Oaklands hands. 
Minnesotas brightest point is that 
they are the only one of the four 
playoff teams to play on turf. With 
their overall team speed, the turf 
allows them to manufacture runs left 
and right, and theyre more used to 
playing defense on the fast surface.
Unfortunately for the Twins, 
theyll only get to play (at most) two 
first-round games in the Metrodome, 
no matter who their opponent is. 
Without that home-field advantage, 
the Twins weaknesses, most notably 
starting pitching, will be exposed. 
Minnesotas leader in wins, Eric 
Milton, ranks behind three starters 
from each of the As, Angels, and 
Yankees, and is currently rehabbing 
a leg injury that kept him out of the 
lineup for almost all of August. Since 
returning, Milton is 0-2 in three 
starts, not making it past the fourth 
inning in either loss. The Twins also 
rank only one pitcher in the top 20 in

Chung gets trick 
against Behrend
Two weeks ago, James Chung 
was the manager for the mens soc
cer team. Last Tuesday, he became 
the teams leading scorer.
The team shutout Penn StateBehrend Tuesday in a lopsided 3-0 
decision spurred by a hat trick from 
Chung, a senior forward. 
Continuing their streak, the Tartan 
men, with sophomore goalkeepers 
Dave Thomas and Brian Close 
behind them, have not allowed a 
goal yet this season.
Chung, expected to be sidelined 
this season due to problems in both 
knees, scored the first goal against 
Behrend in the middle of the first 
half. He continued after the break, 
scoring both of the Tartans goals in 
the second half as well. The three 
goals tied Chung for the overall 
team lead with sophomore mid
fielder James Steidel.
Chung had decided not to play 
this year, opting for a position as 
the teams manager, but with the 
Tartans flurry of injuries, coach 
Nick Gaudioso asked him to suit 
up. He played off the bench in both 
of last weeks wins, while rehabili
tating his knees to playing condi
tion. It was the injury to forward 
Matt Crummy against Oberlin, 
however, that put Chung into the 
starting position.
As his knees and playing 
improve, Chung is acting like a 
born-again-forward: I plan to play 
the rest of the year as long as I stay 
healthy, he said.
Parallel to Chungs goal-scoring 
performance was junior midfielder 
Mike Leonhards assisting, who 
notched assists on each of Chungs 
goals. Goalkeeper Thomas, with 
Close supporting him, continues 
the Tartans shutout streak, which 
stands at four games.
Unfortunately, the team cannot 
seem to play a game and evade 
injury. Sloppy field conditions 
were not responsible this time.
Fifth shutout in a row

The womens soccer team beat 
Saint Vincent College and Penn 
State Behrend this week to bring 
their record to 7-0.
Fridays game against Penn StateBehrend (3-6), ended 4-0 with the 
womens fifth consecutive shutout 
win. The Tartans were in possession 
for most of the game and it seemed 
the only way Behrend could try to 
get it was fouling.
Despite the physical nature of the 
game, the Tartan women were able 
to avoid injury, while continuing to 
dominate their opponents on 
offense. The Tartans held an insur
mountable 3-0 lead at halftime. 
While continuing their reserved 
play, they added another goal in the 
second half.
Earlier in the week, the team host
ed Saint Vincent College (3-2-1). 
The game also ended in a 4-0 deci
sion. Thirty minutes into the first
half, the game was still scoreless. 
The Tartans quickly changed this 
with senior midfielder Melissa 
McMorrow scoring off a combina
tion from first-years Hallie Dumont 
and Kristin Bevilaqua-Linn.
Only 95 seconds later, Katie Snell 
netted a well-placed corner kick 
from McMorrow. The 2-0 lead 
would eventually be enough to win, 
and the team played conservatively 
for the remainder of the half.
According to coach Heather 
Kendra, first-years have helped the 
Tartans dramatically. This chance 
has paid off as the team is evolving 
into a very capable contender.
It was in the second half that the 
talent of the first-year became trans
parent. Both of the teams goals in 
the half were scored by newcomers 
to the team. With St. Vincents 
defense behind her, Nadya Yaghoubi 
scored twelve minutes into the half.
Seven minutes later, Dumont 
scored Carnegie Mellons final goal,
See SOCCER, page A13
Rather, defenseman Alex Beck was 
stepped on. However, Beck should 
recover in time to play in the next 
game.
The team next plays on Tuesday. 
Most of the injured players are 
expected to remain out in preparation 
for the first conference game against 
Washington University on September 
29, though.
Were still not sure how many will 
be ready for the first UAA game, said 
Gaudioso.
Injured star Adam Hibshman is 
also making a fast recovery. While not 
expected back for Washington, the 
team no longer believes his injury to 
be season-ending.
Tuesdays game is at home against 
Saint Vincent College. Saint Vincent 
is 3-2-1 this season after a loss to the 
University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg.
Men earn close
second at Indiana
Carnegie Mellons cross-country 
teams. participated in the Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania 
Invitational Saturday at Indianas 
Mack Park. Also running were IUP, 
Baldwin Wallace, Case Western 
Reserve, Clarion, Franciscan, and 
Slippery Rock.
The Tartan women finished with 
97 points, well behind IUPs women, 
who claimed the home victory, man
aging 43 points. The fastest time in
the womens race, run on a 6 km 
course, belonged to Sara Raschiatore, 
who ran the course in 20:52, a new 
record for Mack Park.
In fifth place, 90 seconds slower 
than Raschiatore, was Kate Aerni, 
Carnegie Mellons top finisher. It was 
where the rest of the team finished 
that kept them from placing higher 
than fourth. The next fastest Tartans 
placed 15th, 17th, and 29th.
This was the first 6k for many on 
the team, which has more first-years 
than usual. Further, most of the com
petitors were Division II schools. The 
biggest victory of the day for the 
women was finishing ahead of UAA 
rival Case Western Reserve.
The mens team finished atop the 
scoreboard, with Matt Meurer and 
Dana Irrer finishing first and second 
with times of 27:03 and 27:10, 
respectively. Seven Carnegie Mellon 
runners finished in the top 20 in the 8 
km race, and the team managed a low 
score of 34 points.
Slippery Rock also finished with 34 
points, on the strength of four top-ten 
finishers. Slippery Rock won a 
tiebreaker with CMU, and the Tartans 
were awarded second place for the 
match.
The next race for both teams will 
be the Duquesne University 
Invitational on Friday afternoon in 
Schenley Park.

Getting around underground
When it rains, dont hide in the bathroom like a high 
schooler skipping third period. As long as your classes are 
in Baker, Porter, Wean, or Doherty Halls, or in the NewellSirnon Building, Carnegie Mellon has got you covered  
literally. To navigate between these buildings in any com
bination, a student never has to leave the comfort of shel
ter.
Wean Hall also connects to Doherty hall on a few differ
ent levels. The seventh floor of Wean connects to the sec
ond floor of Doherty; the sixth floor of Wean connects to 
the back portion of the first floor of Doherty; the fifth floor 
of Wean connects to the basement of Doherty; and the 
fourth floor of Wean connects to the sub-basement of 
Doherty.
Wean Hall is basically the center of all of the connec
tions. The fourth floor of Wean Hall connects to the fourth 
floor of the Newell-Simon Building. Coming from Wean 
Hall, the shortcut leads to the floor above the NewellSimon cafeteria. From here, a student can go to any class
es in Newell-Simon, or exit on the second floor, right next 
to the cafeteria, and end up directly behind Hamburg Hall. 
Coming from Newell-Simon, a student can enter Wean, 
walk up one flight of steps, and exit on the main floor, 
right by Porter and Hamerschlag Halls.
But if Porter Hall or Baker Hall is the intended destina
tion, there is a shortcut from the fourth floor of Wean Hall 
that leads almost directly to the lower level of Porter. It is 
basically a hallway under the ground that lets out on the 
cement steps by Porter. By dashing up one flight of steps, 
one can reach Porter with less outside exposure than the 
more-traversed way.
Elliott said, As far as I know ... [there is] no reason for 
the connections other than convenience and proximity of 
the building.
While some students, mainly those with many classes in 
Wean, have intimate knowledge of these shortcuts, others 
know they are there, but dont know exactly where or how 
many they are. Jeanice Gantus, junior information systems 
major, said, It has taken me practically all of my college 
career to figure out where they all are. I still dont know 
where they all are.
Many students know generally where these shortcuts 
are but never get the opportunity to use them. For exam
ple, Elizabeth Levin, junior art major, has many classes in 
the College of Fine Arts Building. She said, I think there 
should be some shortcuts that include CFA, because we art 
majors, we dont like getting wet either.
It would be more convenient if there were a way to get 
from Porter to Wean without 
having to go out into the ele
ments, and there are rumors 
that there is such a way. But 
as one student in the offices 
of the basement of Porter 
said, No, theres no short
cut. Theres none. You have 
to go outside. Go up the 
stairs and outside. So unless 
hes orchestrating a cover-up, 
no such luck.
From Porter Hall, as every
one knows, Baker Hall can 
easily be reached, because 
Porter and Baker should 
probably not be considered 
two different buildings. Bill 
Elliott, Vice President of 
Enrollment, said, From 
Porter, one can easily get to 
class in Baker, because the 
two buildings have been con
nected. Originally, these 
halls were two separate 
buildings: Industries Hall 
and Administration Hall. In 
addition, this shortcut from 
Wean is a more efficient way 
to reach Scaife Hall, as going 
down the steps leads directly 
to the parking lot in front of 
the building.

students Dine Xpress. Also the cafeteria in Morewood Court 
had been replaced by a Taco Bell and The Corner Oven, a 
pizza place. The meal block system is currently in place 
again, sans both restaurants.

After its first year of service, Skibo Coffeehouse proved 
itself inadequate to function as the ideal hangout it was 
intended to be. Instead of having the vibrant and energetic

advocated leasing the space to an outside company which 
could provide the resources and professional service to aid 
students in eating, relaxing and socializing.

Opinions varied widely following the attacks on the World 
Trade Center and the Pentagon. Some students advocated an 
immediate counterattack on terrorists and the countries who 
harbored them, while others maintained that peace and cau
tion was the obvious course, and still more found themselves 
somewhere in between the two. Various demonstrations, 
peace rallies, and debates took place throughout the campus.

For the perpetually bored and hungry, there is no finer pro
gramming than that offered by the Food Network. And con
trary to popular belief, the cable stations lineup goes beyond 
Emeril, whose catchphrases are growing old and who relies 
too heavily on the ability of 40 cloves of garlic to send his 
audience into raucous applause. There are plenty of other 
options available on Food TV, so grab a cold soda and a spot 
on the couch, because its time to kick it up a notch.

seems to have been made up entirely of Easters and Christmas 
Eves. Try to stomach her syrupy smile, though, because her 
recipes definitely satisfy a sweet tooth. And an occasional

She gardens, she decorates, she sews, she weaves baskets, 
but Martha Stewart found her earliest success as a caterer. 
This fine series showcases Stewarts perfectionist approach to 
all things culinary, giving viewers a glimpse into her immacu
late Connecticut kitchen. She frequently invites guests  
including her mother, Big Martha  to share her recipes, 
but her domineering nature shines through, and Stewart rou
tinely steals the spotlight. While Stewart is entertaining, if 
just for her trademark immodesty and anal-retentiveness, her 
suggestions are often impractical; not many people have the 
time to raise a field full of heritage tomatoes or to make pop
corn and yogurt from scratch. Still, theres something to be 
said for a woman who can make a vase out of a pumpkin and 
the entire Noahs Ark menagerie out of sugar cookies.

Over a decade ago, eccentric Japanese millionaire Takeshi 
Kaga funded the construction of a state-of-the-art kitchen 
stadium, then assembled a league of iron chefs, the finest 
culinary masters of their time. Each week, a wily challenger is 
pitted against one of Kagas men, and the two chefs go head to 
head, given one hour to create new and exciting dishes using 
a theme ingredient. The dishes are judged by a motley panel
of B-list Japanese celebrities  from giggly actresses to stern 
food critics to fortune tellers  and the winner is met with 
ceremonious praise and regal fanfares. The loser, however, 
brings lifelong shame to his family. Nevertheless, the action is 
intense, the constant commentary is riveting, the English sub
titles and over-dubbing are charming, and the food is exqui
site. Highlights include the Peach Battle, the Giant Eel 
Battle, and, of course, the Baby Octopus Battle.

Another import, this series is a welcome gift from our big 
shot network friends across the Atlantic, Englands BBC. 
Young, hip, and lovely host Jamie Oliver won immediate 
praise for his first series, cta FIva9 ftas (a title that refers not 
to Olivers state of dress, but the fact that his recipes are 
stripped down to essentials), and was met with explosive 
enthusiasm after his US debut in November of 2000. The 
Naked Chef followed Oliver around London suburbs, as he 
picked up fresh ingredients from friendly merchants, back to 
his swanky flat where hed whip up fabulous dishes. The 
series unvvI cnvvI was Olivers next endeavor, but his current 
project, owHOaA^p crHpNm best showcases the endearing Brits 
charm and charisma. Each episode sees Oliver preparing 
delectable meals for a new set of guests; he has played host for 
everyone from trendy models to an Abba cover band to his 
childhood schoolmates. He is the ultimate entertainer, and 
the show is a must-see, if just for the delightful British 
euphemisms alone.

This pair of shows, hosted by eternally chortling cookbook author Rachael Ray, is 
arguably the Food Networks finest display of comedy  unintentionally, however. Rays 
self-indulgently cheesy jokes and resultant giggles are comic gold; you might not laugh 
with her, but youll probably laugh at her. Thirty Minute Meals 
spotlights Ray in her kitchen, creating just what the title sug
gests. She is constantly washing her hands and dispensing 
valuable, if formulaic, kitchen advice. We want the stove wait
ing for us, not the other way around, and Chop once, use 
twice are among her favorite credos. $40 A Day  arguably 
the more entertaining of Rays shows  features her gallivant
ing around cities across the nation, checldng out the local 
scenery and trying to support her corpulent appetite on a 
budget and a gourmands palate. Shes highly successful, too; 
her daily diet on her trip to San Francisco, for instance, consisted of Peking duck with 
pancakes, calamari salad, chicken meatball dim sum, Crab Louie salad, Coquille SaintJacques, and Petit Gateau, a mint-chocolate cocktail topped generously with choco
late mousse. Clearly, this is no paupers snack.

Restaurant Review
Standing rib only:
Big Sams provides big 
tastes, no tables
There is a little sign, laminated against 
fraying, near the entrance of Big Sams 
Memphis Barbecue on Federal Street in the 
North Side. On it is a biblical quote that 
speaks to love and truth and simple rules 
lived in the service of a better existence. 
This epigraph is obviously intended for the 
religious among us, but in the world of bar
becue (that is, the South) the lines of devo
tion sometimes blur.
The South proper enjoys four distinct 
areas of tradition when it comes to the 
grilling and preparation of large hunks of 
meat. These are counted, in no particular 
order of importance or expertise as 
Carolina, Texas, Kansas City, and 
Memphis. Each grilling styles provenance 
can be traced back, so its defenders say, to 
one moment, one movement, one extra 
dash or splash of that or another thing 
which clearly places it above its competi
tors.
Memphis, and the so-called Memphisstyle, is no exception to this rule. The city 
has a story and is sticking to it. According 
to Charles Crawford, professor at the 
University of Memphis, settlers, itinerants, 
and more than a few wayward persons 
arrived in the city in the early 1800s. They 
brought with them bright hopes for the 
future and certain practices, gleaned from 
endless nights of cooking in the Virginia 
and Carolina hills, involving smoking meat 
with wood fires.
Pork was the object of the newly-chris
tened residents desire. Pigs were a plenti
ful domestic animal and the smoking 
action of fires containing mesquite and oak 
chips cured their meat in such a way that 
produced an explosion of natural, visceral 
flavors. Arrivals from Louisianas delta 
communities completed the union with 
spices and sauces used in their own Cajuninspired cuisine. Thus, Memphis barbecue 
was born.
Big Sams is clearly in this Memphis 
camp. The menu offerings include chicken, 
beef, and turkey, barbecued, fried, and 
grilled. But you must have the ribs. A din
ner, which comes with ribs, two sides, 
cornbread, and yams, costs $6.75 and is
worth every penny you pay for it.
The Memphis-style cooking means dry 
rubs of herbs on the meat before cooking, 
together with smoking, to produce a gusta
tory effect that can only be described as 
sublime. The meat on the pork ribs is so 
tender, so yielding in fact, that to have the 
bone slip right off of it, resulting in an adja
cent rib double in girth, is not an uncom
mon thing.
The side dishes are not terribly abundant 
or inventive  they tend towards soul food 
mainstays like macaroni and cheese and 
collard greens  but are hearty enough to 
make up for what they lack in originality. 
Cornbread at Big Sams is good, not great, 
but is crumbly and tasty. The yams are 
excellent, sweet and delectable. If youve 
never tried yams before (or are totally 
inured to them because of some bad 
Thanksgiving dinner memory) and find 
yourself in the North Side, ask Sandy, the 
doyenne of barbecue around these parts, to 
whip some up and you will quickly count 
yourself among the converted.
This BBQ joint is for the most part a take
out spot, so dont expect a sit-down meal or 
be put off by the threadbare exterior and 
the less-than-glamorous location; the best 
eateries keep the crowds with their food, 
not their flash. Big Sams Memphis 
Barbecue  A taste of the South on the 
North Side  demonstrates a holy devo
tion to that motto.

Looking inside the brains of psychology 
experiment volunteers:
Who are they, and why do they do what they do?
Money. Thats what people are in search of, and the means 
of accessing money are getting more creative by the minute. 
One way to get fast cash is to participate in research experi
ments; to allow researchers to scan your brain in MRI and 
fMRI testing, manipulate your thought process through 
guess-the-pattern games, or even make you the guinea pig in 
a pilot weight loss program in order to receive monetary 
awards of varying amounts.
Carnegie Mellons research team diffuses through many 
schools and programs, including the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration (GSIA), the Mellon Institute, the 
Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging, the Psychology 
Department and the Human and Computer Interaction 
Institute. Individual grants are awarded within each depart
ment to help fund the costs of experimentation. These exper
iments usually require a substantial number of voluntary par
ticipants and can take up the three hours to finish. To make 
the idea of experimentation more appealing to volunteers, 
participants are paid in cash for their service.
If asked the reasons why I do these experiments, said sen
ior art major Benjamin Rod, I would say that the money is 
given in cash and its tax-free, not to mention comparatively 
higher than the hourly wage of nearly every work-study job on 
campus. Theres no obligation to sign up and I know that I will 
take the experiments seriously and truly be helpful to the 
experimenter. They are frequently interesting and fun, too.
Experiments are open to all willing participants as long as 
they meet the prerequisites for each individual experiment 
that they want to partake in; age, course, and language 
requirements, right- or left-handed, color blind, normal 
vision or corrected to normal vision are a few common pre
requisites. Participants usually consist of both CMU students 
and staff. However, participants are not allowed to take the 
same experiment multiple times just to receive more money, 
unless the study specifically states that the participant is able 
to participate multiple times. Three students and one staff 
member who frequently take experiments said that they have 
participated in between 20 and 25 experiments to date.
One Psychology Department researcher, who chooses to 
remain anonymous, said that the amount of money paid to 
students varies depending on the complexity of the experi
ments, the amount of time the experiment takes, and also the 
performance of the participant. If the participants results are 
exceedingly good, the participant is granted a bonus, usually 
five dollars over the original amount. Before the study can 
run, a protocol must be sent to the Institutional Review Board 
which specifies how much money will be paid to each partic
ipant, experimental procedure, and target population group 
for recruits. General pay ranges from $5 to $15 per session 
and $7 to $10 per hour, which is more than some jobs pay.
MRIs and fMRIs are the most lucrative; participants are paid 
up to $75 on the spot.
Of course, said the Psychology Department researcher, 
people are more interested in experiments that pay more in 
total, but higher pay means more time and more involvement, 
which is not so much attractive.
The studies may 
involve up to four 
or more participants 
at the same time, 
and all the data 
from all four must 
be thrown out.
That is a loss of 
approximately $30 
to $60 per session.
Convenience is the prominent factor in signing up for 
experiments. You sign up when you want, you get money for 
your time, and then you leave and go on about the rest of your 
life. The experiments serve as a supplemental income to stu
dents whose money is stretched to the max with purchasing 
books or art supplies, buying food, or just trying to save 
enough money to have a social life for the weekend. With all
this convenience, there doesnt seem to be a negative side for 
the frequent experiment participant. However, when the par
ticipant doesnt follow the rules of the experimenters poli
cies, conflicts arise and cost the experiment's research 
department great sums of money.
An incident occurred last week in NeWell-Simon Hall which 
concerned an individual who was caught participating in 
multiple Human and Computer Interaction Institute experi
ments under several aliases. He had been told previously, 
when researchers first found out that he was abusing research 
policy, never to return to Newell-Simon and that he was not 
allowed to partake in any more experiments. System Scientist 
for the Human and Computer Interaction Institute and man
ager of the User Studies Lab Susan Fussell reported that the 
individual had harassed the undergraduate experimenters 
and had used the lab telephones without permission to make 
long distance calls.
When a person participates in a study more than once, 
said Fussell, their data must be thrown out. The studies may 
involve up to four or more participants at the same time, and 
all the data from all four must be thrown out. That is a loss of 
approximately $30 to $60 per session.
People who are interested in participating in experiments 
can sign up through the departments web site which lists the 
studies, criteria for participating in them and open time slots. 
Fussell said that even with this incident there will be no 
change in the screening process of the participants, since they 
had been running experiments for years without any prob
lems.
I think that part of the reason [people participate in exper
iments] is because they are serious about these things and 
they want to learn about them, said Administrative 
Coordinator Madelaine Dusseau, who has participated in 
experiments on campus, at the University of Pittsburgh, and 
at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Its an opportuni
ty to contribute to science.

Lecture by Droog Design founder
What does old-fashioned Dutch sim
plicity have to do with a single-piece, 
cylindrical garment strategically knit to 
expose a penis in its own window-like 
frame? Gijs Bakker, a founder of Droog 
Design, explained the matter last 
Wednesday night at the Chosky Theatre.
He should know, because he wore the 
item himself a good many years back at 
an avante garde art show in Holland 
(hint: it involves minimizing complexity 
in clothing, stripping things down to
bare essentials). In more recent years, 
Bakker and co-founder Renny Ramakers 
have been up to other clever exploits, 
including a chair made from space-age 
carbon fiber woven into macrame. The 
chair, recently purchased by the 
Carnegie Museum of Art, exemplifies 
Droog Designs style of mixing the hightech with the familiar, the emotional, 
and the human.

Light designer Carson discussed art
World-renowned cross-disciplinary lighting 
designer Heather Carson spoke to an impressed 
Chosky Theatre audience on Thursday.
Carson, the first lighting designer to receive 
the distinguished Rome Prize, has designed pro
ductions for the English National Opera, New 
York City Opera and Elisabeth Streb Ringside, 
among others. She was recently appointed head 
of Pennsylvania State Universitys MFA lighting 
design program.
Carson bases her design on an emotional 
response to the space and the music. For her,
lighting is energy and she does not like to employ 
conventional technical terms of lighting or the 
usual equipment. She has created lights for 
dance performances, opera and theater, films, 
and also for the Pet Shop Boys World Tour in 
1991.
In her art, she draws from principles of many 
disciplines, including space theory, psychology, 
architecture, visual art, chemistry, and theater. 
Her lecture featured numerous slides of her inter
nationally acclaimed work.

cabaret for Watsron? closing
Wats:on? Festival Across the
Senior drama students perform
As the finale of the Wats:On festival, the 
senior musical theater majors performed a 
student cabaret for the jam-packed audience 
at the Alumni Concert Hall. The night was 
full of talent and more talent as these future 
Broadway stars displayed their incredible 
voices.
Were asked to do it every year, and we 
think of it as a great honor to be able to do 
something for the festival, and for the 
[Watson] family, says Leslie Odom. The 
small group of seniors (Odom, Rory 
OMalley, Will Taylor, Jonathan Putterman, 
Matthew Griffin, Katie Mixon) were joined by 
Audra Blazer and Pilar Millhollen, both members of the class of 2004.
The small class of eight musical theater 
majors (with one currently abroad) compris
es of a wide range of voices. Putterman and 
Millhollen, who performed the hilarious 
number Tear Jerk are outstanding. 
Putterman not only sings, but gets complete
ly into character and makes the scene appear 
to be right out of the show, rather than a 
cabaret piece.
Another standout was Mixon, who sang 
Broadway Baby from gEwwHapl She possesses 
such a strong and huge voice that she 
induced shivers during her last belt.
The Jill Watson Festival Across the^ j8
The other six student performers were  
to put it simply  amazing as well. Their 
singing styles were all so different, and they 
provide a nice balance between traditional 
Broadway songs with contemporary pop 
music.
The night ended with a heartwarming
Youve Got A Friend, sung by all the stu
dents, as the Wats:On festival came to a close. 
Anyone who has yet to see these performers 
can attend their next student cabaret on 
September 27 at the Purnell Center.

Few things are as artistically satisfy
ing as combining the visceral and the 
intellectual. This is what 
with/out.flesh, a student-run modern 
dance performance, sought to accom
plish. The program from the perform
ance read, The metaphysical condi
tions of a person are expressed only 
through the persons physical form ... 
bringing with the flesh things out of the 
flesh.
The concept for the project began in 
the spring of 1999, when three archi
tecture majors with diverse talents 
applied for two Small Undergraduate 
Research Grants. The founders, 
Constance Chen, Allison Fisher, and 
Jeanne Mam wanted to create a venue 
for modern dance on campus and 
explore an interdisciplinary partner
ship of arts. Chen designed and created 
all the costumes, while Mam choreo
graphed. Fisher worked on set design. 
The two grants enabled the students to 
produce Design for the Body in the 
fall and Without Flesh in the spring.
The directors met periodically with 
architecture advisors Laura Lee and 
Dutch MacDonald and Daria Ward, a 
dance professor. Costume, set, and 
technical support expenses required 
with/out. flesh to seek funding from 
several sponsors. The dance organiza
tion ran fundraisers to supplement the 
resources with/out.flesh received from 
the Office of the President, Dean of 
Student Affairs, and two SURGs.
Unlike Dancers Symposium, which 
has many student choreographers, 
with/out.flesh is a semi-professional 
modern dance company of 11 dancers 
with a single choreographer. Chen said 
that it is also unique because of the 
design element.
Anya Martin, one of the dancers and 
a senior directing major, said The com
pany is an accomplishment for CMU in 
the sense that we had all majors present 
... there werent so many barriers that 
CMU seems to have.
The future of the group is still unde
cided, but will depend upon both stu
dent and sponsor interest. For now, the 
directors want to rest their dancers, 
who donated hours of their time for the 
past two years of the project without
Last performance for student 
dance group with/out.flesh
pay or course credit. We dont want 
[our dancers] to get unhappy, said 
Fisher.
The performance opened with per
cussionists standing in the corners of 
Purnells Rauh Theater. Barefoot and 
dressed in black, each musician entered 
one at a time, striking a Tibetan prayer 
bowl. The ensembles spirited but intro
spective improvisation added to the 
ambiance of the dark, cold theater.
The pieces Zero, Menstrate, To Love 
Me, and The Selling (Out), were the 
most effective; the dancers communi
cated meaning and conflict with 
intense energy. Through non-uniform 
choreographing, Zero illustrated a con
flict of individuality in a social context.
In Menstrate, five female dancers 
were connected by their costumes, 
which was made out of one large piece j 
of red fabric. The twisting, audible ; 
breathing, and spasms captivated the 
audience and contrasted with slower, 
more peaceful sections. Martin, who 
performed in Menstrate, said, You 
have to be brave to do that piece [and 
trust]' the audiences open-mindedness.
The design element in To Love Me 
was particularly notable: a 3-step plat
form with hanging mirror and metal 
poles. This section of the Love Montage 
dance featured a single dancer on 
pointe and explored the forgotten val
ues in self-appreciation. The final piece, 
The Selling (Out), was most remark
able for its flashy choreography and 
costumes, which included black mas
querade ball masks and feathers.
The only part of the performance 
that was a bit jarring was after the final 
dance. The audience members werent 
given enough time to digest the final 
piece before the percussion ensemble 
broke in with a booming beat for the 
curtain call. If the ensemble had waited 
a little longer or built up its beat and 
volume gradually, the finale would 
have been more effective. We had 
mixed reactions to all our shows. A lot 
of people arent exposed to modern 
dance, says Martin.

Take Nothing for Granted
Stop. Look around you. What do you see?
Slowing down and taking the time to really look at the world around us is 
the overall focus of the new photography exhibit, Take Nothing for Granted, 
in the ground-floor gallery of the University Center. Greg Fogel, a senior 
communication design major, shows everyday objects through the lens of his 
camera in ways we may not have taken the time to see before. My goal as a 
photographer is to give greater insight into the overlooked elements of exis
tence, Fogel said.
In his first series of photographs, Textures, Fogel explores the visual and 
tactile qualities of things seen often in day-to-day life, things you may pass 
over because they re so common. A neon orange construction fence 
becomes a thing of vibrant beauty. The stark lines of steel bridge girders 
form a striking contrast to a bright blue sky. Mostly in black and white, with 
a handful in color, the photographs are contemplative and sensual. The focus 
is on shape, color, and texture rather than literal form, revealing unique, 
arresting brands of beauty in places we might least expect. In this series I 
bring attention to the beauty that lies in the pattern, shape, depth, reflectiv
ity and other material qualities of the objects around us, said Fogel. With 
the Textures series, I am inviting everyone to look at their world closer 
than they normally do.
On a lighter note, the second series, Signs, shows the often quite funny 
results of signs that fail to meet their purpose. Illogical, confusing, and some
times downright silly, there is something slightly wrong with either the 
wording, placement, or overall message of each of the signs pictured.
His technique for 
photographing this 
show was in keeping 
with its theme: 
rather than pre
planning his pho
tography sessions,
Fogel would instead 
grab his camera and 
go for a walk. I 
never knew what 
pictures I was going 
to take, he said.
They would find 
me. Nor was the 
theme itself planned.
I think I had been 
seeing things in that 
way for a while, con
sciously or uncon
sciously, and when I 
realized what I was 
doing, I used it as a tool to show other people these things I was seeing. For 
example, textures just started appearing in the work I was doing, and once I 
noticed that, I put them together into a cohesive whole. I didnt go out and 
shoot them all at once.
I have a theory about photography, said Fogel. I believe that there are 
thousands of beautiful pictures everywhere, all around you, all the time. You 
just have to find them. He does.

Book ReviewA college kids guide
to dealing with college
Creative and quirky, it is a new outlook on col
lege life, a true outlook. Steve Hofstetters first 
guide-to-life handbook, RNn9aTN yE9M RtENpm is 
about as real as college gets. Well, in a sense; as 
Hofstetter puts it, a sarcastic look at the best 4-6 
years of your life.
The idea for the book began as a column 
Hofstetter started writing for the fEwnd1HI 5IHwM 
R-aiNINEA in his junior year at Columbia University. 
Some of the material in the book, he said, is updat
ed material from his column.
RNn9aTN yE9M RtENp opens with a foreword by 
Rider Strong, yes yEM 2aaNp PEAw9 Rider Strong. 
Its short, to the point, and makes a wonderful, 
humorous preface to Hofstetters book, summariz
ing the idea that we are all caught in the whirl
wind of confusion of college together.
Sometimes I think [Strongs] two pages are 
funnier than my 97, Hofstetter said.
The remaining 97 pages are short segments 
detailing the ins and outs of typically normal 
college life. The topics range from Instant 
Messenger, friendly jani
tors, and hooking up to 
high school friends and 
dealing with going home 
for the holidays. Each has 
smug commentary with 
relatively good suggests to 
follow.
Comments such as, 
You can tell a lot about 
someone by what they 
keep in their shower bas
ket. Four different sham
poos means theyre 
obsessed with their 
appearance. Neatly labels 
mean theyre anal. And a 
tube of foot fungus means 
they probably forgot to 
buy shower shoes, (9) 
and, Before you actually 
hook up with someone at 
a Halloween party, make 
sure its actually a mask, 
(82) fill the book.
But its not all about sex, 
drugs, and rock n roll. 
Hofstetter also focuses on 
the true reason for col
lege, the academia. He 
gives questioning remarks 
and advice on papers: 
Why do professors still 
say ten-fifteen pages? 
Why cant they just say
nine pages with five lines on the tenth page? Some 
people type in Courier New or Arial or change the 
margins or headings. But the best way to add a 
line here and there is to be wordy where it counts 
(59).
As for the aim of the book, it isnt purely for 
making fun of college life. In fact, its doing noth
ing of the sort. Its goal, Hofstetter stated, is 
Knowing that you're not alone  that youre not 
the only one who screwed up your laundry  that 
makes [college life] easier.
In other words, RNn9aTN yE9M RtENp is a self-med
ication for those stressed-out days. Its short, easy 
to read, and will provide a great deal of humor to 
an otherwise humdrum, homework-filled day. If 
nothing else, it fills you up with the, glad Im not 
the one who forgot their shower flip-flops feeling.
And if after reading it, you still feel lost in the 
big college ocean, Hofstetter offers up some 
advice, Id say find the nearest mall. They usually 
have you are here signs. Those are a big help.

artists gathered at Starlake Amphitheatre right outside of Pittsburgh, not just to perform in 
front of their fans, but more importantly to spread the word and inspire those who may have 
previously been unaware of the detriment that factory farms are causing to family farms.
Farm Aid began in 1985 in the midst of a massive farming crisis. A group of dedicated artists 
bonded together to support the rural farming communities. Since it began, Farm Aid has 
raised over $24 million to promote a strong and 
resilient family farm system, with an end goal of 
eliminating the middle man, so people can buy 
food directly from family farms. Before the show,
Willie Nelson explained, We are fighting for the 
American dream. Start at the bottom, go straight to 
the top, bypass all that is in between, from produc
er to consumer. Thats what were fighting for.
Dave Matthews ended his eight-song set with a powerful version of All Along the 
Watchtower, changing some lyrics to the factory farmer ruined my earth.
The simple stage became a Broadway production for John Mellencamp. Even Kid Rock fans 
were enjoying themselves when he played Small Town and Aint that America.
Neil Young and Willie Nelson, two of Farm Aids founders, performed the last sets. Young 
spent several minutes teaching, inspiring, and hopefully changing peoples thoughts for their
next grocery trip.
Despite the benefits purpose, most people . 
seemed to have bought tickets (many for thousands
of dollars on eBay) just to see Dave Matthews. Matthew McConaughey, the emcee of the ben
efit said it perfectly, If people come to the show primarily to see their favorite artist, but leave 
having been inspired to help out our family farms by eating good, organic food, than our goal 
has been accomplished.
Kid Rock riled up the crowd with his hit song Bowitaba, during which he had the crowd 
chanting aid. Or maybe they were excited because he asked the audience, Who wants to 
come backstage and fire it up with me and Willie?
Who wants to come backstage 
and fire it up with me and Willie? 
 Kid Rock
Shoppers, buy with a conscience and save a family 
farm, he said. The crowd seemed to agree, cheering 
just as loud for his words as his songs. He ended his set 
with Sugar Mountain, inviting four Native American 
farmers to dance with him.
Willie Nelson had appeared several times throughout 
the show playing duets with a few bands, but his bands 
performance was topped with a vibrant version of 
Heart of Gold. Most of the performers came back on stage to encore with Nelson in On the 
Road Again.
To see how you can help, or to find out more, visit rrrlsIAdIH9liEdl As Matthews 
remarked before the show, Helping out does not stop when the show is over. Its your every
day actions at the supermarket that makes the most difference.

Farm Aid 2002: stars raise money, awareness for family farms

---------------------------------------------------

A SIDE: rage B SIDE: ani
Since the demise of Americas premiere political-rock powerhouse, no other band has 
managed to blend music with a message in quite the same way as Rage Against the 
Machine. Formed in LA in 1991, Rage produced intense rock and rap. Energetic frontman 
Zack de la Rocha and innovative guitarist Tom Morello merged a mutual love of old 
school hip-hop with de la Rochas punk and hardcore roots, and Morellos adoration of 
classic rock. This, in combination with a solid rhythm section (arguably the most essen
tial part of the group) consisting of Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk, gave 
Rage a distinct, effective sound.
Rages success was not solely due to its wide range of influences. The band 
also gained a loyal following amongst listeners with leftist political views 
who were willing to put aside the fact that they were signed to Sony. Rage 
encouraged their listeners to join various activist groups such as UNITE!, a 
group that aids union workers and helps to end sweatshop labor; Women 
Alive, a group that supports women living with HIV and AIDS; and Refuse 
and Resist, an organization that works to reverse the views of persons who 
are openly racist, homosexist, and misogynistic. Signed to a major record 
label, Rage enjoyed the success that came from it. Their success was criti
cized as hypocritical for a band that openly scorned capitalism. Rage answered that by 
signing with Sony they could promote their messages to a larger audience.
In the fall of 2000, artistic differences led de la Rocha to part ways with the other three 
members of Rage. The bands relationship had always been tempestuous at best and cou
pled with a sudden surge of success after the release of their last album, yINNwa Es WEp 
SThawapm Rage broke up. De la Rocha began working on fresh material with underground 
and popular hip-hop artists, while the rest of Rage enlisted the vocal talents of several 
rappers before settling on Chris Cornell to continue with the band. Rage and Cornell pro
duced a demo, broke up, and then got back together as a group called Audioslave, which 
has yet to officially release an album. Though Audioslave isnt likely to incorporate poli
tics into its music, the message conveyed by Rage was and will continue to be received.
Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, Ani DiFranco began her performance career at 
the age of nine, playing Beaties songs in local bars. At 15, DiFranco moved out of her 
mothers apartment, began writing her own songs, and graduated from the Visual and 
Performing Arts High School a year later. When DiFranco turned 18 and had tired of the 
somewhat limited Buffalo bar scene, she moved to New York City, seeking independence 
and a successful musical career. Now, nearly twenty albums and a record label later, Ani 
is considered one of the foremost women in music.
DiFranco is her own woman: producer, writer, performer. Her record 
label, Righteous Babe Records, operates out of Buffalo and employs local 
printers and manufacturers. DiFranco writes, performs, and records her 
own songs, creates the artwork for and releases her own albums, and has 
signed seven other artists/bands to her label. DiFranco is currently on tour, 
solo, and just released a second double-disc live album, RE 2nit RtEnNHThm 
RE 2nit WInhtNaAl
DiFrancos articulate emotions and poignant lyrics are made more pow
erful with her distinct voice and rhythmic guitar. Though it would be unjust 
to categorize DiFrancos music as politically driven, there are certainly traces of her polit
ical opinions scattered throughout. DiFranco shatters stereotypes and addresses 
inequities of all kinds, gender and otherwise. And surely she realizes the power of her 
lyrics. In the song Willing to Fight, she croons, I fight fire'with words/Words are hot
ter than flames/Words are wetter than water.
DiFranco has experienced large amounts of success while remaining below the radar 
of most mainstream music enthusiasts. She has developed and retained a loyal diverse 
fan base. She releases one album nearly each year and continues to write, record, and 
tour just the way she wants to and has always wanted to  independently.

Lookout Records presents more Berkeley punk for the kids
Throughout the early 1990s, Berkeleys Lookout Records 
served as the epicenter for the growing pop-punk movement. 
Bands such as Screeching Weasel, Rancid, and The Queers 
emerged as the forerunners of punk rock, building on the suc
cess of the Ramones. For the latter part of Lookout Records 
prominence in the punk community, Christopher Applegren 
was at the helm, keeping the label alive during a changing of 
the pop-punk guard as classic bands broke up and others, like 
Green Day, struck it rich with the masses.
A few years ago, Applegren fully embraced the DIY ethic of 
punk rock and decided to start a new band unlike any the 
label had ever seen. Thus, The Pattern was born, not merely 
out of an effort to salvage his ailing record label, but in the 
purest spirit of rock n roll. With Applegren on vocals, the 
band crafted their self-described brand of punk soul boogie 
through incessant practicing and gigging around San 
Franciscos East Bay. They released numerous EPs on Lookout 
and began to attract a steady following over the years. The 
last EP, a seven-song barrage of sonic bliss entitled 
6dda9HINawMm was the bands first chance to present their raw 
yet stylized sound on a national level.
The Patterns latest release, their first full length, entitled 
zaIw gaawTappm builds on the solid rock foundation cast by 
6dda9HINawM and exhibits solid progress in their musical, as 
well as lyrical, ability. With the distortion knobs on their amps 
turned to the levels of MC5 and the Stooges, The Pattern stay 
true to their roots, kicking out the jams in the vein of angstfilled punk rock from which they were born. At the same time,
the band injects a bit of old-time soul into a punk genre that 
has been Ziploc-sealed in a body bag tailor-made by the likes 
of such punk acts as Sum 41 and Blink 182.
The Pattern delivers driving guitar 
rhythms, moving from punk to soul to 
classic rock with the greatest of ease.
The drummer executes frequent time 
changes to accommodate this versa
tility, showcasing his skills with fills in 
nearly every song on zaIw gaawTappl
Most improved from 6dda9HINawMm 
however, is the bassists mastery of 
guitar-like riffs as each fret-frolicking 
bass line catalyzes much head-bob
bing abandon for the listener.
While Applegren has obviously sac
rificed some of his voices guttural 
grit for lyrical comprehension since 
the last EP, the lyrics on zaIw gaawTapp 
are still as sweet as they are cynical.
Singing in a bona fide pop-punk bratty snarl, he delivers catchy choruses 
like, Straddle my heart, saddle my part and verses like, 
Lets note the salesman clinging to your arm, dim-witted 
Cassanova umbrellad by your charm throughout the record. 
An intriguing, ironic intellect becomes evident in Applegrens 
seemingly nonsensical, scatterbrained lyrics as the album pro
gresses.
Tracks like Nothing of Value and Thunder Us are domi
nated by choppy guitar picking and sustained pauses between 
chords that make for a certain rock n roll vigor unattainable 
by mere strumming alone.
Other songs like Selling 
Submarines utilize a cleaner 
sound coupled with twangy guitar 
breakdowns reminiscent of the 
Yardbirds. The song Happy 
Sarong, showcases The Patterns 
versatility with an emo-ish break
down preceded by classic rock 
guitar grooves and a Brit-pop 
beat.
Rocking out with raucous ener
gy, The Pattern redeems a musical 
trend that has recently granted 
every magazine from Time to 
Tiger Beat the license to use such 
buzz phrases as garage rock and 
pop punk. While the band may 
seem like a confluence of sounds 
of old, they are genuinely one of the few bands of todays 
garage barrage that mixes these tastes in the right propor
tions, creating a musical pattern unlike anything on the air
waves today.

The Bouncing Souls were the most prominent of the impres
sive opening acts. The term hit might be absent from the 
parameters of punk, but mainstays like Hopeless Romantic 
and Kate is Great were well-received with sing-along chants 
and oodles of bone-crunching fun.
Yinzer punks Anti-Flag were the main reason everyone came, 
and they delivered with an intense hometown show. The 
quartet performed songs from throughout their decade-long 
career, in line with their politically liberal, pacifistic, and 
humanitarian views. Nothing captured these messages and 
their energy more than ditties like Mumias Song and Right 
to Choose, and the grand finale that flooded the stage with 
screaming fans, Die for the Government. To discuss the 
political nature of the band and the essence of activism 
through punk, I sat down with drummer Pat Thetic before the 
show. Below are highlights from the interview:
MC: Whats it like playing a hometown show?
PT: We dont consider ourselves to be a national or interna
tional act.... We still consider ourselves a local band.
MC: You guys are into a variety of political and social issues. 
Would you say theres any appropriate political label to group 
them all together?
PT: I would just say being a humanitarian.
MC: Would you consider these to be radical views?
PT: I dont think so! I think theyre fucking pretty straightfor
ward, but obviously, its a radical idea to treat people with 
respect and to try to make things better for everybody.
MC: One symbol that even goes along with your name is the 
upside-down American flag.... What would you say the sym
bol means?
PT: The true symbol of the flag upside-down is a distress call, 
and thats a lot of what were talking about.... We are trying to 
be a mouthpiece for ideas that arent out there normally.
MC: Are you personally, you or any other members of the 
band, activists for a specific cause?
PT: We are activists every day of our lives, but we are not 
specifically affiliated with any cause.... All political activity 
has a basis in art and has a basis in music.... We think that 
music is a great way of emotionally charging people to make 
changes.
MC: Would you say theres any point in having a rift between 
hippies and punks, and all these other names for idealists and 
activists?
PT: I think no matter what subculture you consider yourself to 
be a part of, if youre moving towards positive change, and 
moving towards trying to get a word out, or trying to make 
information available to people, I dont think its relevant 
whether youre a punk or a hippie or a rave kid or whatever.
MC: Would you say that its okay for a punk or an activist, or 
someone like that, to lose focus of the main goal of societal 
betterment? For example, is there any constructive gain in 
sports or other forms of entertainment?
PT: Oh, yeah! Im in no way saying that you 
have to be a robot. I played soccer when I was 
in high school.... Instead of limiting ourselves, 
we need to be looking to expand ourselves.
You can be whatever you want to be, and thats 
ultimately our goal: to have everybody be who 
they want to be, but treating other people with 
respect.
MC: Do you support any specific candidate in 
the upcoming state governor election?
PT: I do not know very much about the gover
nor election, to be honest with you, but I am 
interested in information.
MC: Generally though, do you support the 
Green Party?
PT: Definitely, I support the Green Party. I was
nt aware that [gubernatorial candidate 
Michael Morrill] was his name. The Green 
Party is definitely the best choice. Hopefully 
we can get other people to agree with that.
MC: Do you disagree with being labeled an 
anti-establishment band?
PT: I understand that people call us an anti
establishment band, and our goal is to not 
be.... Wed like to be singing about love and 
happiness and girls.... Thatd be ideal, if we 
didnt have a battle to fight.
MC: Who would you say is the most prominent political music 
group out there right now?
PT: That brings us to a bigger question, more than just who we 
think the big bands are. If your goal is to have a mouthpiece 
to get ideas out to people, how is the best way of doing that? 
Rage Against the Machine decided that they had more power 
by using Sony and using MTV, and using things to get these 
ideas to a wider audience, and I think they did. I think they 
brought the plight of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal 
to a lot of people who wouldnt be aware of that, and I think 
thats a good thing.... Its much better to see Rage Against the 
Machine at number one of the Top 10 than Britney Spears, 
whos endorsing Pepsi and has absolutely nothing to say, or 
Kid Rock, whos a complete moron.
MC: Whats it like being straightedge on the punk touring cir
cuit?
PT: I dont know how you can do what we do and be drinking 
heavily, because at least for us, its so difficult just to get 
everything together that we have to be at the top of our game 
to do it. But other bands are quite capable of being loaded a 
lot and still pull it off, and thats great.
MC: Have you ever tried it?
PT: I have tried alcohol. Actually, last tour we had these cans 
of beer but they looked like red soda. So I was like Im really 
thirsty. I took a big drink and I was like This isnt red soda; 
this is beer! I do know what alcohol tastes like, but its not my 
thing at all. I live my life better not having it.
MC: Youve played the Warped Tour a few times. How do you 
feel about the diluted-punk crowd that attends the shows?
PT: I think there are some very, very intense, very focused 
bands that have a lot to say on Warped Tour. And I think that 
those bands are lots of times overlooked, but again its the 
Rage Against the Machine thing that when you put that many 
people into a space that you can speak to, thats a great thing. 
There were some bands on Warped Tour that are not my peo
ple, but what are you going to do?
MC: Why do you have the stage names and personas? Is it an 
act, because the messages you purport are certainly very seri
ous messages?
PT: Why not? When we were young, we just came up with 
names.... People tend to think that we are a lot more serious 
than we really are. We have a lot of humor to what were 
doing too, or at least we try to. I dont know what it comes off 
as; maybe other people dont realize that were funny. But we 
think were pretty funny.
MC: Do you think that cursing in your music might turn off 
certain crowds?
PT: We use it willingly, and the reason why we use it is 
because it is a way of getting peoples attention.
MC: Finally, what can you tell me about the new split album 
that you just did with The Bouncing Souls?
PT: Their songs are great, and were happy with the way our 
songs sound. Were excited about it; we think its a really cool 
thing.

This movie is, indeed, about a boy. Without Elizabeth Hurley, Hugh 
Grant is a petty boy. His manhood was taken faster than John Bobbitt when 
Liz slammed the door on his sorry face. Poor chap, he pulled himself 
together a bit when he starred opposite Julia Roberts in FENNHTh Hwwm but 
hes still a boy. Its a travesty for a boy to be named Hugh. Its far too simi
lar to huge, which implies grand stature and girth. A boy has none of these 
things. Parents wishing to name their child Hugh should start with a dif
ferent one, and grant Hugh only when the time is appropriate. Timmy is 
ideal, with its close resemblance to tiny. Timmy Grant, yeah, thats more

First of all, I want to say this. Those who thought this movie was too 
graphic are pansies. This is a great movie. Morgan Freeman is the man. He 
is Samuel L. Jackson in 10 years. Freeman, a CIA agent, tries to help Ben 
Affleck thwart a nuclear bomb threat in Baltimore during the Super Bowl. 
It is a good thing that the Ravens were not playing the Steelers in the movie 
(even though the teams were fake anyway). Who could even imagine what 
Myron Cope would say if the stadium were under nuclear attack? His cus
tomary six-pack would be finished quickly, if it hadnt been already, and he 
would probably break out the quadruple yoi.

John Leguizamo does not look like Luigi, but he does wear a green suit. 
I always felt sorry for Luigi. He only got to play when Mario needed oppo
sition. He never got his own video game until later, and his car in Mario 
Kart is among the slowest. He must be the middle child, getting the shaft 
time after time. I speculate that Princess Toadstool is a long-lost little sis
ter, with Toad being the deformed last child. Luigi is only treated as an 
equal in the original Mario Brothers. Its always nice to be the second play
er in that, so you can be sure Mario gets the short end of the stick. Luigi is 
the superbrother of the two.

Movie ReviewLa Ville in the afternoon
At first it may be a little overwhelming to follow 
the different characters and plots, as one storyline 
cuts to another with little or no transition and then 
cuts to the next. However, the characters develop 
soon enough, their stories all begin to fall into place, 
and together they create a picture of a city, an envi
ronment, a collection of human experience. The 
pieces combine in WI eHwwa apN NAITnHwwa to tell the 
story of the people of the French city of Marseilles, 
according to the vision of director Robert 
Guediguian.
WI eHwwa apN NAITnHwwa is a true-to-life depiction of 
the working class in Marseilles. The main story con
cerns a woman who is struggling to take care of her 
teenage daughter and her granddaughter while 
working at the fish market at night. Other stories 
focus on a taxi driver who is looking for love; his 
mother and father who are adjusting to the fathers 
early retirement, and consequent readjustment of 
his life; and a music teacher who decides to divorce 
her husband and finds love where she doesnt expect 
it. Thats the surprise of this film: even though it 
deals with some difficult issues, drugs, infidelity, 
and racism, a feeling of love and strength is the back
bone of the whole thing.
The cramped dwellings, low-paying jobs, obvious 
presence of hopeful prostitutes, and feelings of des
peration are evident, but WI eHwwa apN NAITnHwwa^s pro
tagonists somehow maintain integrity and dignity. 
The films theme of distant beauty is touched upon 
at one point by one of the characters discussing how 
beautiful the city looks from his balcony. The open
ing of the film is a long, scanning shot of the ports of 
Marseilles and the town on the water, then focuses 
on the dock workers who are striking.
WI eHwwa apN NAITnHwwa kicks off the third annual 
French in the Afternoon film series, sponsored by 
the Modern Languages Department and the Division 
of Student Affairs. When picking the movies, Sylvie 
Rockmore, who heads the program, tries to choose a
good variety. There is always one African movie, and 
there is no one set theme that all the movies adhere 
to. I choose from a list that they send to universities, 
and I try to choose movies that havent been shown 
in Pittsburgh. The first three' [this fall] have never 
been seen before in Pittsburgh, explained 
Rockmore.
The movies are free and are a good opportunity to 
not only get a greater appreciation for other cul
tures, but the way other cultures make movies. In a 
campus as international as Carnegie Mellon, I think 
we need to be sensitive to the others. One of my 
dreams at this point is to create an international film 
series, said Rockmore. She noted that the majority 
of the audience are not French students or French 
speakers, but international students. They come 
because they want to see another point of view.
Its a very different way of making movies. It 
shows a world thats made up of many facets, said 
Rockmore. One of the most interesting elements of 
WI eHwwa apN NAITnHwwa is how the conventions of story
telling in French cinema differ from that of the 
United States.
The lengthy amount of time spent on background 
shots or focusing on the faces of the characters is one 
thing that sets French cinema apart from American; 
the camera spends a far greater amount of time in 
one place, despite cutting abruptly from scene to 
scene, and makes the viewer stop and think for a 
moment.
Many people are not exposed to this because of 
the scarcity of foreign films in the US. Rockmore 
remembered being in Senegal when cHNITHi was in 
the box office and it was showing all over the coun
try. In the US you dont see the same thing happen
ing; they watch our movies, but we dont see many 
of their movies. Thats the problem, said Rockmore.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Now Lobo  that ms a duck. Lobo was the sort of duck you didnt want 
to mess with. In fact, you didnt even want to see him on the other side of 
the street unless you had flowers to give him. You see, Lobo was a tough 
duck. Maybe the toughest there ever was. But he had this thing for flowers. 
Most drakes will go crazy for bread crumbs, and maybe some cute duckettes, but Lobo didnt care too much for those. Give him some flowers, how
ever, and he would love you more than anything. Lobo had a penchant espe
cially for purple flowers, and also yellow ones. 1 made sure to always have 
some of those for him. And he always accepted them graciously, placing 
them gently in a clean vase with fresh water, and finding a prominent place 
to display them in his lakeshore home. Lobos philosophy was that any duck 
could betray you, but flowers were just pretty. And he would beat you up if 
you said otherwise.

Horrorscopes
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Thanks to your consistent diet of Ofries and bottled Frappuccinos, you will realize that no, you do not 
have to be on a boat to get scurvy.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Next time you invent a religion with 
thousands of overzealous followers, aim for deity status. Martyrs 
may be influential, but there are certain qualifications they have to 
meet which can be difficult to pull off.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): 
Despite dyeing your hair three differ
ent shades and shopping at Goodwill, 
you will still be identified and subse
quently removed from Purnell. 
Science students just smell different.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): On the upside, you may be able to 
sue crew for false advertising. On the downside, after lifting for a 
month you still dont look better naked.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): 
Despite what they will tell you when 
you agree to join the study, you will 
soon discover that side effects are 
not synonymous with super pow
ers. Or at least you would if you 
could still form complete sentences 
and didnt think you flew around inJeremy Canceko/Art Editor
the night on the underbelly of a giant opossum.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Regardless of what Bruce 
Feirsteins book zaIw 2aT 5ET^N UIN "nHita tells you, its not the 
quiche that will threaten your masculinity, its all those poultry hor
mones youre ingesting.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Its time to think of a new 
tuition payment strategy. Pigeon racing and organ sales are just not 
viable options  not in the United States, anyway.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Greece welcomes you 
with open arms, as long as you dont like Turkey.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): You will not recov
er from the dreams where you are trapped inside a computer that is 
bludgeoned to pieces by a calculator-wielding CS professor, but you 
will eventually get used to them.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): The diagram on the 
back of the tortilla package may help 
you finally learn how to wrap a burrito, 
but it still wont help you woo that bril
liant Central American girl down the 
hall.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 
18): You will finally dive into the world of veganism after the trying 
to explain where dairy products come from to the Cave Man that 
Brendan Fraser helps you dig up from under your basement.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Sure, having a quirky child
hood nickname worked for Weezer, but naming your band PumpkinHead might not be the best way to recover from years of being taunt
ed for your abnormally large cranium.

I'd have to say that on average, the girls 
in the freshman class are a little more 
attractive, but then again its a matter of 
opinion and it is based only on the small 
pool of freshmen I've met. However, 
when I've seen an attractive girl so far 
this year, I can't help but think she is a 
freshman.
