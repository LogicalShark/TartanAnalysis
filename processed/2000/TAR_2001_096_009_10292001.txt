Police report 
attack against 
CMU student

Managing Editor 
& Sara Henneberger
News Editor
Carnegie Mellon Police and 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy reported last week that a 
female student was the victim of a 
robbery and a possible sexual 
assault on Sunday, October 14. The 
crime took place between 6 and 7 
pm in the area of the Peace Garden 
located adjacent to the Hunt 
Library on Carnegie Mellons cam
pus. The victim was attacked from 
behind and rendered unconscious. 
At some point during the attack, 
the victim was injected with an 
unknown narcotic. According to 
the University-released crime alert, 
the victim stated that she last 
recalled throwing trash into a 
garbage can before awaking in 
nearby shrubbery feeling dizzy and 
disoriented. The victim sustained a 
head injury, and money was 
removed from her bag.
The crime alert also stated that a 
possible sexual assault may have 
occurred, but the Carnegie Mellon 
Police have not confirmed such an 
assault. Police Chief Creig Doyle 
and Dean Murphy would not 
release additional details or the 
official incident report, citing vic
tim confidentiality as well as the 
need to avoid public panic.
I dont think our female students 
need to be any more stressed out 
than they would have been before, 
said Doyle. Assaults are very often 
crimes of opportunity. There is 
nothing the victim is doing [to 
cause the crime]. The victim is just 
in a particular place at a particular 
time, and a perpetrator thinks this 
is a good time to grab a person. 
Doyle said that the recent crime 
on campus had been referred to the 
Pittsburgh Police for investigation. 
There is an agreement between 
the University and the city police 
that if a sexual assault occurs on 
campus by a stranger, the city 
police will handle the entire situa
tion and the campus police will 
assist in any way we can, said 
Doyle, adding that the victim of a 
sexual assault has final discretion

Carnegie Mellons recent decision 
to use clean energy to power its 
buildings and facilities, hopefully 
cutting its 8 million dollar annual 
utility bill  a bill that is mainly the 
result of temperature control and 
lighting in academic and campus

Reduce. Reuse. Recycle? On a 
campus with a growing environ
mental awareness on the part of 
both the student body and of the 
administration, recycling still 
poses a constant source of debate. 
Some campus community mem
bers claim that the University 
recycling programs are adequate, 
while others question the overall 
awareness and effectiveness of 
the programs.
I think that the fact that we 
recycle on campus is great. But, 
the program isnt promoted at 
all, said Gokul Ramdas, a firstyear computer science major. I 
dont know what materials can be 
recycled and what materials go 
into which bins. I wish this infor
mation was available to the stu
dents.
Alex Kim, a first-year architec
ture student, agrees with 
Ramdas. Recycling is a very 
important issue of today. I would 
like to be able recycle more on 
campus, but I really dont know 
how to go about doing it.
The materials recycled on cam
pus include plastic, glass and 
paper. However, paper is not recy
cled in the dormitories. Large 
amounts of paper constitute a fire 
hazard, which is especially dan
gerous since not all of the resi
dence halls have had sprinkler 
systems installed. Yet, some stu
dents wonder why the paper can
not be collected from floors every
_
Behnam Farahpour/Photo Co-Editor
day, thus allowing the recycling 
of another material in the dormi
tories without violating any fire 
codes.
I hate that paper isnt recycled 
in the dorms, said Yevgenia 
Khoder, a sophomore biology and 
psychology major. The program 
simply isnt regulated enough.
According to Reg Koslos, project 
manager for Central Property 
Services (CPS), CPS workers are 
responsible for bringing bags of 
recyclables from the various cam
pus receptacles to the physical 
plant. The removal of wastes and 
recyclables is done during the 
night shift, after the bins get filled 
during the day. The bags taken 
from the recycling bins must be 
pure, said Koslos. If a CPS work
er finds any bit of trash, whether is 
it is a cup of coffee or a part of a 
sandwich in a bag marked for recy
cling, the entire bag is regarded as 
trash and is put into a dumpster.
Some students have expressed 
concern at what they believe to be 
unnecessary disposal of recy
clables because of bins that are 
not clearly marked or misunder
standing on the part of campus 
community members about what 
constitutes recyclable material.
Its terrible the amount of 
waste that must occur because 
people on campus arent aware of 
what can be recycled, said Matt 
Wheller, a sophomore biology 
major. Although I try to rinse 
food containers out, others dont 
realize. Just one person who may 
accidentally throw away a halfeaten bagel can ruin the recycling 
done by a hundred others.
Despite student concerns about 
the manner in which recycling is 
carried out on campus, the 
University does offer a full range 
of recycling opportunities. Not 
only are glass, aluminum and 
plastic recycled, but the program 
has branched into recycling bat
teries, fluorescent bulbs, metal, 
and even computers. Barbara 
Kviz, the environmental coordi
nator for Facilities Management 
Services (FMS), and Melissa 
Burik, who works for 
Environmental Health and Safety, 
both explained the procedures of 
recycling on campus.
Basically, after CPS transfers 
the materials to the physical 
plant, various companies pick up 
the materials, said Kviz. These 
companies obtain contracts with 
CMU through a bid process; the 
lowest bid receives the contract.
See RECYCLING, page A3
ciency of the University, students 
and faculty involved in green 
organizations throughout campus 
finally earned a small part of their 
goal  Carnegie Mellon has agreed 
to get five percent of its entire ener
gy supply from clean wind turbine 
energy.
Until now, Duquesne Light sup
plied all of Carnegie Mellons elec
tric energy. The switch to turbine 
power for a portion of the 
Universitys energy is good for sev
eral reasons, according to support
ers. Wind energy means a pure  
and more importantly, renewable 
 source of energy that neither 
harms the environment with 
ozone-destructing pollutants nor 
leads to astronomically high energy 
bills. Additionally, Carnegie 
Mellons switch to clean power will 
hopefully influence surrounding 
schools and communities to do the 
same.This is the second goal achieved 
by those working toward a greener 
Carnegie Mellon. Martin Altschul, 
University Engineer for Carnegie 
Mellon, said the first achievement 
was reached when all the paper 
being distributed on campus 
switched to recycled paper, rather 
than virgin, first-time-use paper. 
Altschul, who has worked closely 
with the project, hopes that the 
spirit of conservation will be con
tinued by the students own 
actions. By seeing the University 
make an effort to employ environmentally-friendly practices, he 
hopes that students will be pro
pelled to reflect on their own per
sonal actions and learn to conserve 
energy at home by turning off 
lights when they are not in use and 
setting their computers to sleep 
mode when not in use.
The topic of the panel discussion 
at the end of Energy Fest was

When students checked their 
midterm grades online last week, 
many were surprised to see a new 
addition to the traditional letter 
grades: pluses and minuses. The 
implementation of plus/minus 
(+/-) letter grades for midterm 
evaluations is part of a threesemester-long experiment to 
gauge the effect of a more 
detailed grading scheme on stu
dents and professors. The issue of 
+/- grading has been long debat
ed at CMU, and campus communi
ty feedback has been immediate 
and varied to the recently imple
mented grading experiment.
The proposal to utilize +/- 
grades had been suggested by fac
ulty several times over the past 
few years, and the University 
Education Council (UEC) gave it 
serious consideration again last 
academic year, believing that +/-
grading could give finer, more 
flexible feedback regarding stu
dent performance. Consequently, 
a survey of students carried out by 
the Student Senate Academic 
Affairs Committee, chaired at the 
time by Erin Fitzgerald, showed 
that while some students did want 
+/- grades, of those who respond
ed, there was an overwhelming 
number who agreed that +/- 
grades were not desirable to stu
dents.
I think it is unfair to down
grade your achievements with a 
minus sign, said Fernando 
Zambrana, a sophomore mechan
ical engineering major. It makes 
me feel like my achievement is not 
enough.
According to Adam Harber, a 
junior business administration 
major and Student Body
President, [Students] main 
argument was that the stress level 
is so high at CMU already that 
they do not want to have to worry

Pupils to become educators 
in fall 2002 pilot program
by Chris Messina
Staffwriter
A new pilot program giving 
Carnegie Mellon students the 
opportunity to teach courses of 
their own design to members of 
the CMU community is slated to 
begin next semester. The mission 
of the Student College Pilot is to 
provide members of the CMU 
community with the opportunity 
to share in educational coursebased experiences that are not 
available through regular univer
sity offerings, as led by Carnegie 
Mellon students. The Student 
College (StuCo) pilot came about 
from the independent activities 
of two CMU students, Ian Nieves, 
a fifth-year senior computer sci
ence and economics major, and 
Noble Shore, a junior computer
science and psychology major. 
Working with Janet Stocks, direc
tor of undergraduate research, 
and Mark Stehlik, assistant dean 
for undergraduate education, 
respectively, the two simultane
ously developed the notion of 
student classes within the 
University.
Program development at CMU
Shores efforts stemmed from 
his involvement playing bridge 
in the computer science lounge. 
As a tournament bridge player, 
Shore found himself teaching a 
number of students the game, 
and since he had been certified 
to teach bridge by a national 
bridge . association, he

Thousands of Pakistanis to assist Taliban in holy 
war against American troops in Afghanistan
Anthrax alerts continue 
to plague Capitol Hill
TEMERGARAH, Pakistan (AP)
 In buses and trucks, pickups 
and vans, more than 5,000 people 
rolled out of a northeastern 
Pakistan village Saturday morn
ing, bound for the Afghan frontier 
and vowing to fight a holy war 
against the United States.
Hundreds were reported cross
ing into Afghanistan over rugged 
mountains by Saturday evening, 
Pakistani border police said.
Thousands of Pakistani men, 
young and old, had massed in 
Temergarah on Friday night with 
assault rifles, machine guns, even 
rocket launchers. A few even car
ried axes and swords.
Their mission, they said: to enter 
Afghanistans Kunar province and 
help the countrys ruling Taliban 
defend against any ground incur
sions by American troops.
I am an old man. I consider 
myself lucky to go  and to face 
the death of a martyr, said Shah 
Wazir, 70, a retired Pakistani army 
officer. In his hands Saturday 
morning, he carried a French rifle 
from about 1920.
Organizers said similar-sized 
groups were massing in other
towns across North West Frontier 
Province, an enclave of ethnic 
Pashtuns with ties to  and deep 
feelings for  neighboring 
Afghanistan.
Volunteers gathered in scores of 
groups of 20, sitting on the ground 
to be briefed on the ways of jihad
 Islamic holy war  by military 
commanders wearing black tur
bans and full beards similar to the 
Taliban militia. One key rule: obe
dience to leaders.
Hussain Khan, 19, a carpenter 
from the area, carried a Kalashnikov 
and stood with his friend. He said he 
was leaving behind a fiance and 
joining a just cause.
Whether I come back alive or I 
am dead, Ill be fortunate because I 
am fighting in the service of 
Islam, Khan said.
The call for holy war came this 
week from Sufi Mohammad, an 
outspoken Muslim cleric who runs 
a madrassa, or religious school, in 
nearby Madyan. He exhorted true 
Muslims to mass and prepare to 
go to Afghanistan  to repel any 
US ground incursions.
What they will do upon arrival is 
uncertain. But hundreds of vehi
cles  more than 1,000 volunteers
 rolled into the mountains that 
separate the two countries 
Saturday night, said Himdallah 
Khan, a police official at Bajur 
Agency, a borderland area. Many 
returned empty. Hundreds of other 
Pakistanis from different areas 
were converging near Bajur.
In this region of Pakistan, 
Mohammads organization, Tehrik 
Nifaz Shariat Mohammadi 
Malakand, or Movement for the 
Enforcement of Islamic Laws, has 
been embraced.
It was impossible to verify how 
many supporters were actually en 
route to join him. In recent weeks, 
many militants have claimed far 
more backing than rallies eventu
ally produce.
However, the numbers in 
Temergarah on Saturday morning
 and the people jammed into 
trucks and on bus rooftops  sug
gested support was heavy. 
Mohammads backers say the 
number to enter Afghanistan will 
reach 100,000.
The night before, men had 
massed by the thousands in 
Temergarah and other windwhipped mountain villages in 
northeastern Pakistan's mountains.
Out-of-towners, their conversa
tion crackling with anticipation, 
roamed Temergarahs streets. 
Pickup trucks patrolled town with 
loudspeakers attached, calling 
people to assemble with a chant: 
Afghanistan will be a graveyard 
for Americans. Men huddled 
around radios, listening for news 
about the conflict; most tuned in 
to the BBC.
People camped on porches, ben
eficiaries of local hospitality. 
Others slept on floors of public 
buildings. Mosques lodged as 
many as they could, and supplied 
food and blankets.
I cannot tolerate the bombing 
and the cruelty of Americans. I 
must go, said Mamoor Shah, a 
medicine salesman who, at 18, has 
a wife and child. Muslims cannot 
keep silent.
Im going. My mother sent me 
to fight for our faith, said Farooq 
Shah, 21, a student from Buner, 50 
miles away. When she told him to 
go, he had no Kalashnikov. So she 
went out, sold her jewelry and 
bought him one.
Labor Deptartment will not pursue charges in AOL wage dispute case
Earthquake 
shakes New 
York City
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
Labor Department has decided not 
to pursue complaints over the use of 
unpaid volunteers by America 
Online, the worlds largest Internet 
provider.
The department informed AOL, 
now owned by AOL Time Warner 
Inc., that because of the agencys 
limited resources, it was inappro
priate for the government to inter
vene in the dispute, which pitted the 
technology giant against its own socalled community leaders, who 
handled subscriber requests and 
supervised chat rooms.
The decision leaves the case in the
hands of federal judges, who are 
considering lawsuits filed by the vol
unteers under the US Fair Labor 
Standards Act. One lawsuit was filed 
in May 1999 in New York, and 
another was filed this week in San 
Jose, Calif.
The Labor Department some
times declines to intervene in dis
putes that are being litigated. Its 
decision was revealed in a letter sent 
last month to AOLs lawyers but 
made public only this week. Given 
our limited resources, this was not 
something we were going to pur
sue, Labor spokesman Stuart Roy 
said Friday.
AOL did not pay its volunteers in 
the 1990s but gave them free access 
to the service as compensation, at a 
time when Internet monthly access 
fees could reach more than $100. As 
the price of online services dropped, 
however, some volunteers began 
complaining that AOL  whose 
market parent companys capitaliza
tion is roughly $148.8 billion  was 
illegally taking advantage of their 
efforts by not paying them outright.
The California lawsuit demands 
four years of back pay at $6.25 per 
hour, plus premium pay for any time 
worked in excess of eight hours each 
day.
NEW YORK (AP)  A minor 
earthquake shook the New York 
City area early Saturday, rat
tling the nerves of some resi
dents still jumpy in the wake of 
the September 11 terrorist 
attacks.
A magnitude-2.6 earthquake 
hit under Manhattan around 
1:42 am, said Dr. John Ebel, 
director of the Weston 
Observatory at Boston College, 
which monitors seismic activity 
in the Northeast.
Thats more than a tremor. 
Thats a small earthquake, Ebel 
said.
At first, police scrambled to 
determine the source as 911 
calls flooded in reporting shak
ing buildings and a booming 
sound, said Detective Edward 
Reuss, a spokesman for the New 
York Police Department.
There were no immediate 
reports of injuries or damage, 
Reuss said. Recovery work con
tinued uninterrupted at the site 
of the World Trade Center col
lapse.
Carolyn Bell, a spokeswoman 
for the US Geological Survey, 
said the quake was felt into 
Long Island and New Jersey.
New Yorker Josephine 
Toscamo said she was woken by 
a loud boom. Im a little shaken 
up so Im going to spend the 
night at my friends, she said.
The last significant natural 
seismic event to strike the city 
was a magnitude-2.4 earth
quake on January 17.
Giant crocodile fossils found in Africa
WASHINGTON (AP)  A croco
dile longer than a school bus and 
weighing about 10 tons was the top 
predator in an African river 110 
million years ago, routinely dining 
on large dinosaurs that came with
in range of its toothy jaws.
When this thing grew into an 
adult it was really a monster, Paul 
C. Sereno, a well-known dinosaur 
hunter at the University of 
Chicago, said in an interview. This 
thing could have easily pulled 
down a good-sized dinosaur.
Fossils of the monster crocodile 
were uncovered in a desert in 
Niger last year by Sereno and his 
team. The species, called
Sarcosuchus imperator, or flesh 
crocodile emperor, was first dis
covered by French scientists in 
1964, but the Sereno find is the 
most complete fossil skeleton 
known.

Students awarenss of energy issues 
increased through Energy Fest 01
ENERGY, from page A1
Renewable Power: Always
Green. Professors and students 
attended the discussion to listen to 
and participate in a debate about 
renewable energy versus conserva
tion. Issues discussed included 
benefits of renewable energy, the 
effect of the Universitys decision to 
switch to clean power, and the stu
dent bodys opinions and reactions 
toward the University changes in 
initiative. Scott Matthews, a 
research faculty member of GSIA, 
also addressed the benefits of other 
Pennsylvania communities consid
ering the switch toward clean 
power.Energy Fest 01 featured a perfor
mance by the band Coal Train, 
which was chosen by event organiz
ers because of its bluegrass, 
acoustic, low-energy feel, accord
ing to Behnam Farahpour, a senior 
design major and the student intern 
in charge of publicizing Energy Fest 
01. Another band, the B3s, provid
ed music during the festivals clos
ing reception in Rangos.
Organization booths set up in and 
around Kirr Commons served as the 
main focus of the festival. 
Representatives from Carnegie 
Mellons Green Practices organiza
tion and the CMU Earth club were 
present to pass out pamphlets and 
talk to students about simple things 
they can do to begin the conserva
tion process.
Representatives from the Sierra 
Club, a national organization that 
works to preserve nature and fur
ther environmental causes attended
the event. Peter Wray, the Allegheny 
County chairperson of the Sierra 
Club, commented that Energy Fest 
01 benefited students on many dif
ferent levels  beyond the initial 
encouragement to conserve energy 
resources. I hope [students] are 
able to ask themselves [after this" 
event], is there more in this world 
than getting a job with a big corpo
ration?
Wray, who worked as a researcher 
for nine years in the metallurgy 
department at Carnegie Mellon 
(which has since become material 
science and engineering), also dis
cussed apathy amongst the student 
body toward environmental and 
political issues, saying that this 
served as one of the reasons that he 
was so eager to bring information 
about conservation to campus.
To the chagrin of undergrad students, plus/minus grading system introduced

about every little point because it 
could mean the difference between 
a minus and a plus.
Although many students 
expressed negative sentiments 
about a permanent implementa
tion of +/- grades, other 
believed that the new grading 
system could provide them with 
better feedback about their 
work.
[Plus/minus grading] is good 
because it gives an advantage to 
the students who have border
line grades, adding distinction 
and accuracy, said Salma Ting, 
a sophomore communication 
design major.
After surveying academic 
departments and gathering stu
dent input, a subcommittee of 
the UEC, headed by music pro
fessor Marilyn Thomas and 
including Harber, recommended 
implementing the system on a 
trial basis for mid-semester 
grades only, when they would 
not be part of a students perma
nent record. It was decided that 
for the next three semesters, 
there will be no evidence of a 
grading policy change on stu
dent transcripts  undergradu
ates will receive final grades 
without plus or minus distinc
tions; graduate students will 
continue to receive final grades 
with pluses and minuses.
During the trial, A+ will not 
serve as valid mid-term grades 
for undergraduate students. 
Harber explains, students did 
not want an A+ because they felt 
there was so much pressure just 
to earn an A, that they did not 
want the added stress of having 
to worry about earning an A-K 
Some students believe that the 
value of a university education 
should ultimately rest on the 
knowledge gained and not on the 
grade received. Brian Namey, a 
junior ethics, history, and public 
policy major and Student Body 
Vice President, said that when 
we start caring only about the 
grade, we are failing as a student 
 we lower our standards.

data storage technology. The 
Department of Commerces 
Advanced Technology Program 
within the National Institute of 
Standards and  Technology 
awarded the grant.
The consortium plans to spend 
the $21.6 million over five years 
to study Heat Assisted Magnetic 
Recording (HAMR). This technol
ogy uses lasers to momentarily 
heat magnetic storage disks as 
they record data, potentially 
increasing their storage capacity 
by a factor of 100.
Robert White, professor of elec
trical and computer engineering
and director of the 18-year-old 
DSSC at Carnegie Mellon, com
mented that the University and 
Seagate Technology applied for 
funds that would support 50 per
cent of the projects work.
The project was too high a risk 
for Seagate to do individually, so 
it was a collaborative effort with 
other universities and the federal 
government, said White.
Parts of [this high risk project] 
need to be researched, and the 
technology will probably not be 
used for another five years or so. 
The idea was a little cloudy, and 
pretty long range, so companies 
were a little reluctant to put in 
the money for something thats so 
far away, said White, explaining 
why federal funding was required 
for the project. Eventually, HAMR 
is expected to help the data stor
age industry meet the challenge 
of keeping up with overall storage 
demands.
While disc drives can store a
tremendous amount of informa
tion, our world now more than 
ever increasingly relies on the 
storage, exchange, and commune 
cation of information. The result 
is that the need to deliver new 
advancements in storage technol
ogy such as HAMR has never been 
clearer, said White.
Seagate Technology and DSSC 
have a strong relationship that 
dates back almost 20 years. The 
existence of Carnegie Mellons 
DSSC was the major factor for 
Seagate Technologys decision to 
place its research facilities in 
Pittsburgh in 1998. Seagate 
Technology states that they uti
lize universities as important 
research venues when conducting 
global technological research. 
Other universities with which 
Seagate collaborates include 
Stanford University, University of 
California, Berkeley, University of 
Michigan, and Queens University 
in the United Kingdom.
Students critical of Universitys lack 
of on-campus recycling publicity
Although Carnegie Mellon recycles paper and cardboard, such receptacles are not present in dormitories.
Services, estimated that about 4 
truckloads, or 25 tons, of materi
al is sent there from CMU each 
year.
Kviz and Burik also explained 
the process of recycling batteries 
on campus We are now able to 
recycle NiCad, lithium ion, nick
el metal hydride, and lead acid 
batteries which are normally 
found in CPUs and cameras, 
said Burik. The batteries are 
then taken away by the 
Rechargeable Battery Recycling 
Corporation.
The University recycles com
puters, and students can dispose 
of both working and nonworking 
units. Computers that are still in 
working condition are refurbished by the Computer 
Maintenance Group and then 
given to Goodwill. Computer 
monitors that are not in working 
condition must be recycled, as 
they are otherwise considered a 
hazardous waste. Computer 
monitors are never to be thrown 
into a dumpster, said Burik.
Despite a comprehensive recy
cling program on campus, many 
students still believe that recy
cling efforts could be make more 
widespread and be better publi
cized.
I think the recycling that is 
done on campus, especially in 
the dorms, could be conducted 
in much smoother fashion, said 
Wheller.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 29,2001
University to implement student-taught classes in fall 02
STUCO, from page A1
of teaching a class.
Though the University com
monly employs student teaching 
assistants (TAs), lab assistants, 
and the Computer Science 
Department offers student tutors, 
there has never been an entirely 
student-run program designed to 
let students explore areas outside 
of their disciplines while receiving 
credit for both taking and teach
ing classes. Thus Stehlik took 
Shores proposal to Indira Nair, 
Vice Provost for Education, to see 
if it would be possible to create a 
new class devoted to bridge.
Without much difficulty, Stehlik 
was able to add the course 
Introduction to Bridge, 69-185, to 
be run during the Fall 2001 
semester Mondays and 
Wednesdays from 6:30-8 pm. The 
class was treated as a Physical 
Education mini for practical pur
poses, and thus carried with it 3 
units. According to Stehlik, 20 stu
dents are currently enrolled in the 
course and thus far it has been a 
success.
The big question, said Stehlik, 
was whether we could offer cred
it for a student-taught course. 
Though Stehlik was confident that 
Shore would be capable of teach
ing a course deserving of credit, it 
was unclear whether studenttaught courses for credit would 
somehow undermine the creditvalue of other core courses.
For Shores course, 3 units were 
offered like most other phys ed 
course. Undergraduate students 
are allowed up to 9 similar gener
al elective units to use towards 
graduation. Shore did not, howev
er, receive credit for his role as 
teacher, nor was he compensated 
in any other way. In essence, his 
course served as the prototype for 
Ian Nieves StuCo proposal and 
was treated as a functional model 
of how a StuCo course would actu
ally manifest itself.
On October 18, the argument 
brought before the
Undergraduate Education Council 
(UEC) for giving credit to studenttaught classes was based on a 
desire to legitimize the learning 
experience that will be offered 
through the StuCo program. Even 
a relatively small number of units, 
Stehlik reasoned, would encour
age both the student teachers and 
course enrollees to take their
StuCo class more seriously. 
Additionally, credit would neces
sitate a distinction between, for 
instance, playing bridge for fun 
and actually learning bridge.
The Oberlin program
Some of Carnegie Mellons 
Student College Pilot takes its 
roots from the Oberlin College 
entirely student-run Experimental 
College (ExCo) program. Founded 
in 1968 as an experiment in alter
native education, ExCo now offers 
anywhere between 60 and 90 
courses every semester. All cours
es are chosen, taught and evaluat
ed by students. All members of the 
Oberlin community, including fac
ulty, staff, graduate students, 
undergraduate students, and local 
townspeople alike may enroll in 
ExCo classes for 1-3 credit hours. 
Students are permitted to accu
mulate no more than 5 credit 
hours of the total 112 needed for 
graduation. All ExCo courses may 
also be audited for no credit.
As an Oberlin alum and parent 
of a current Oberlin student, 
Stocks brought her experiences 
and knowledge of ExCo into con
versations she had with Ian Nieves 
last spring as he developed his 
proposal for a similar program at 
CMU. As a result of their discus
sions, they eventually visited the 
school, located in Oberlin, Ohio, 
and talked with ExCo committee 
members and students about the 
program. The interchange of ideas 
led to the development and prepa
ration of the StuCo Pilot Proposal, 
which was submitted to the UEC 
earlier this month and has since 
been approved to begin accepting 
course applications for the fall 
2002 term. Were borrowing 
some of the [ExCo program] 
ideas, said Stocks. Ones that we 
think will work here, for instance 
a committee that reviews pro
posed courses, and modifying 
other aspects and putting a twist 
of our own. I think our courses 
will have more of an academic 
core to them.
After studying the Oberlin sys
tem in depth, Nieves and Stocks 
worked on the pilot proposal, 
which Nieves says is more rigor
ous and academic. There is no 
officially preferred teaching 
method at this point and thus it 
will be left up the StuCo teachers 
discretion as to how they will run
Police, deans office report

in determining whether an investi
gation and/or prosecution is pur
sued.
The sexual offense investigations 
division of the city police will 
release their incident report when 
the department finishes interview
ing the victim. The city investiga
tion has not yielded suspects, but 
there does not appear to be a con
nection to the East End rapist. The 
East End rapist has attacked sever
al Pittsburgh-area women during 
the past two years in the citys East 
End neighborhoods and several 
eastern suburbs.
The MOs [modus operandi] are 
not the same [between the CMU 
attack and the East End rapist], 
said one city detective.
Three days after the attack, 
Campus Police posted a crime alert 
with several particulars about the 
event. Seventy-five flyers were 
hand distributed across campus,
while another 100 were given to 
Student Life to disseminate.
Doyle said that while not opti
mal, the outcome would be satis
factory, if information such as 
crime alert posters made the 
University community more aware 
of a possible sexual assault inci
dent, and in turn drove an attacker 
into seclusion. He added that the 
emphasis at CMU should be on 
safety and crime prevention.
In reaction to the robbery and 
possible sexual assault, Doyle is 
planning several changes in polic
ing protocol. We are going to insti
tute different patrol procedures, 
said Doyle. He explained that an 
extra officer would be placed on 
foot patrol during all shifts, bring
ing the total number of foot patrol 
officers to three. As previously 
planned, bicycle patrols will be 
increased and officer uniforms will 
be made more identifiable.

Activist lawmakers to stand 
trial for slander in Syria
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP)  Two 
dissident lawmakers accused of 
slander and inciting sectarian vio
lence are to be tried Tuesday in 
criminal court on charges that 
carry a life sentence, their lawyers 
said.
Lawmakers Mamoun Homsi and 
Riyad Seif are among 10 opposition 
politicians, human rights activists 
and intellectuals arrested over the 
past two months, much to the dis
appointment of Syrians who had 
hoped for quick reform under 
President Bashar Assad.
A legislator since 1994, Seif, 55, 
was detained a day after hosting a 
political gathering attended by 
about 200 people, his lawyer, AbdelRahman al-Issi, said on Sunday. The 
government said Seif did not have 
permission to hold the meeting.
Homsi, 45, was arrested after 
staging a hunger strike to protest 
the government's failure to answer 
his calls to end martial law and 
tighten controls on Syrian security 
services.
On Sunday, a Syrian human 
rights organization urged authori
ties to release the two men, citing 
their poor health. The Human 
Rights Association in Syria said the 
men should be tried in civilian 
court, with lawyers present.
The eight other detainees face 
similar charges and are to stand 
trial in the'state security court.
Since taking office last year, 
Assad has freed hundreds of politi
cal prisoners and allowed universi
ties and banks to privatize, but has 
occasionally cracked down on 
political opponents.
their classes.
How StuCo will work
A student committee and facul
ty advisers will oversee the appli
cation process for StuCo. The 
committee will be composed of 
three executive student positions 
(president, secretary, treasurer), 
one faculty advisor, the director of 
the Undergraduate Research 
Initiative (ex-officio), and any 
reasonable number of additional 
assistant students. Committee 
members have the option to take 
StuCo courses concurrently dur
ing their term, however they may 
not evaluate the course in which 
they are enrolled.
The committee will initially be 
selected by the UEC and each out
going board will choose subse
quent committees. Each student 
committee position will be 
responsible for delegating and 
coordinating the various activities 
of StuCo, which will ultimately be 
overseen by Student Activities.
The course approval process 
will be based on a course applica
tion form submitted by the poten
tial instructor(s), an applicant 
interview form based on the inter
view of the potential instructor of 
a given course, and finally, the 
recommendation of a sponsoring 
faculty member. The student 
teacher must also pass an oral 
interview administered by the stu
dent committee. All three execu
tive committee members as Well 
as the faculty advisor will ensure 
that the applicant is qualified and 
that the course goals are in line 
with the mission of StuCo before 
approving a proposal.
Students will have until the 
third week of any semester to sub
mit their class proposals for the 
following semester. No more than 
two teachers may teach a StuCo 
course, in which case both appli
cants will submit a course applica
tion form and undergo a joint oral 
interview. It is possible that only 
one of the two applicants may be 
approved to teach the course.
The general University atten
dance policy will apply for student 
run courses, and if a student miss
es more than three classes, he or 
she will fail the course. StuCo 
teachers will be encouraged to 
consult the committee to resolve 
issues concerning classroom poli
cies as well as to seek teaching
guidance.
One key component to the suc
cess of the StuCo Pilot will be the 
course evaluation process. The 
Teacher Evaluation Form will be 
given to all StuCo students to fill 
out at the middle and end of each 
teaching period in order to judge 
the performance of their respec
tive teacher. The first evaluation is 
designed to help StuCo teachers 
adapt and better understand their 
role in the classroom setting. This 
will also enable them to become 
more aware of their teaching tech
nique and provide an opportunity 
mid-way through the semester for 
adjustment. The final course eval
uation will be used similarly, but 
will also serve as a gauge for stu
dent satisfaction with the pro
gram as well to determine if cred
it has been earned by the student 
teacher.
Additionally, part of a teachers 
evaluation will consist of an 
observation session, carried out 
by any member of the StuCo com
mittee. Susan Ambrose, director 
of the Eberly Center for Teaching 
Excellence, has indicated that the 
Center would be willing to help 
train observers to give feedback 
on class performance, as well as 
help adapt feedback or evaluation 
forms to fit StuCos needs.
As a student activity, StuCo will 
likely receive funding from vari
ous sources within CMU, includ
ing the Student Activities Fee, and 
the dean of Student Affairs. StuCo 
courses will be allowed small bud
gets in order to cover costs such as 
reusable course materials or other 
necessary classroom materials. No 
one shall receive payment based 
on her or his involvement with 
StuCo.
Future of StuCo
While the Oberlin program has 
been successful for over 30 years, 
the question of whether a similar 
program can survive at CMU is an 
obvious one. There have also been 
concerns raised by students like 
Erin Kelly, a senior design major, 
who questions the validity of 
assigning University credit to 
courses taught by students with
out a masters or doctoral degree. 
The fact that StuCo will be the 
first program of its type attempted 
at a research university also stirs 
up some question about whether a 
traditionally technically and
career-focused school can break 
from its professional core to let 
students stray more freely and 
intentionally outside of their dis
cipline. Mark Stehlik believes that 
CMU can have success with the 
program, as witnessed by the 
diverse range of available student 
activities and multidisciplinary 
courses, such as Acting for NonMajors or physical education 
courses, which are already in 
place.
We need to create broadband 
educational opportunities for 
broadband students, said Stehlik. 
We need to give students the 
opportunity to take the intellectu
al lead and explore the world 
around them.
Student teaching opportunities 
are already a well-defined part of 
the University experience. Stehlik 
said that there already is a desire 
from students who want to teach, 
especially at the secondary level, 
but hardly enough preparation or 
training available. Stehlik, who is 
also a lecturer in the Computer 
Science Department, acknowl
edges that he never received for
mal training in classroom educa
tion. Through a series of related 
events he ended up being offered 
a lecturer position after volunteer
ing to run other students punch 
card programs as an undergrad. 
Though he had no experience 
teaching, he took the position any
way and has been with CMU for 
the past three decades.
StuCo is one way of giving stu
dents experience in teaching 
while simultaneously taking class
es. One result of this new perspec
tive on teaching might be a better 
understanding of a students 
learning. The most important 
educational outcome might actu
ally be the autonomy and respon
sibility that students develop to be 
stewards of their own learning, 
said Nair.
This new autonomy may poten
tially bring with it some new haz
ards from which students have pre
viously been far removed. 
University professors who attain 
tenure often feel more secure in 
their jobs and are thus willing to 
try alternative teaching methods 
or to approach subject matter in 
unorthodox ways or from different 
perspectives. Such experimenta
tion is encouraged and taken for 
granted in the academic environ
ment. However, when that free
dom transcends the teacher-student border, it becomes unclear 
what liberties a student may be 
given in determining both the 
structure and content of their 
course.
The StuCo committee is 
designed to evaluate a course 
based on its merits as a course, the 
applicants ability to teach the 
material, and whether the course 
is in line with StuCos mission, but 
not on the actual content of the 
course. Stehlik hopes that as a 
University, were big enough to 
look at many different ideas. 
Since StuCo is a very new 
approach to education within the 
University, he believes that at this 
point, the campus community 
should take a wait and see 
approach. One of the underlying 
goals is to spur more academic 
fun and exploration; if contro
versy arises because of the pro
gram, that in and of itself may be a 
valuable learning experience.
Ultimately, the Student College 
Pilot is an expression of a 10-year 
long effort to spur multidiscipli
nary endeavors and recognize the 
importance of cross-disciplinary 
experience at CMU. StuCo repre
sents for the student an elevation 
of their own native knowledge and 
the chance to put that knowledge 
into public practice and use. This 
also represents a formative move
ment towards a more progressive 
and diversified student identity. A 
number of questions and possibili
ties emerge from this new student 
organization: What will it mean 
for the official transcript credit 
system if students are given credit 
for courses taught by their peers? 
How will it impact Carnegie 
Mellon to become the first 
research university to dispense 
credit for student courses? What 
will be the defining characteristics 
of the student-teacher interaction 
in the classroom? Will a program 
such as StuCo lead to more innov
ative University-wide changes?
Nieves agrees that despite ques
tions surrounding the eventual 
effectiveness and success of the 
program, students ultimately 
value peer-to-peer learning. It 
seems that students like learning 
from people their own age, said 
Nieves. I would then say that it 
would be nice if we could all learn 
from who we like learning from. 
Peer to peer [education] I believe 
would work well for us.
Big rig, hazardous material truck drivers take 
precautions against possible terrorist attacks
CORDELE, Ga. (AP)  Waitress 
Gail Sanders keeps photos of sus
pected terrorists beneath the 
counter and scrutinizes eveiy cus
tomer who enters her busy south 
Georgia truck stop.
We look for these folks, said 
Sanders, pulling out her printout of 
the FBIs 22 most-wanted terrorists. 
You keep your eyes open and lis
ten.
She and many of the truckers who 
roll in to sip coffee and eat fried 
chicken have become obsessed with 
a fear that before Sept. 11 seemed 
remote  that terrorists would use 
some of the nations 1.5 million 18- 
wheelers as weapons.
Trucker Charlie Bell says many 
drivers have stopped routinely giv
ing Smokey Bear warnings over 
their CB radios. They dont want to 
warn any terrorists who may be lis
tening about state troopers spotted 
on the highway.
The entire industry is in a height
ened state of alert. The Department 
of Transportation, FBI and 
Environmental Protection Agency 
have urged companies that trans
port hazardous materials to be espe
cially vigilant. Officials say at least
one of the witnesses being sought in 
the terrorist attacks in New York and 
Washington was licensed to haul 
hazardous materials.
Transportation Secretary Norman 
Mineta has proposed legislation to 
give the DOT more authority to stop 
and inspect trucks carrying haz
ardous materials, and some lawmak
ers have proposed criminal back
ground checks for hazmat drivers.
Truckers themselves are taking 
steps to avoid having their rigs 
stolen or hijacked. The American 
Trucking Associations, the nations 
leading trucking organization, has 
urged drivers to communicate regu
larly with dispatchers, to vary their 
routes to avoid being followed and 
to park near other trucks or at rep
utable truck stops so other truckers 
can help keep an eye out.
Schneider National, North 
Americas largest trucking company, 
based in Green Bay, Wis., said it has 
stepped up security, but wouldn't 
say how, to safeguard our cus
tomers, associates, equipment and 
facilities.
Schneiders orange trucks are 
among the hundreds of 18-wheelers 
that roll into the vast parking lot at
the Travel Centers of America near 
Cordele each day.
The stop, located along Interstate 
75 about 180 miles south of Atlanta, 
is a haven where truckers can fill up 
their rigs, shower, relax in a TV 
room and dine in the restaurant, 
where Sanders rushes around refill
ing coffee cups and serving stacks of 
pancakes.
Far from big cities or military 
bases that would be possible targets, 
the stop is nonetheless full of drivers 
and employees worried about ter
rorists.
I watch where I park and who is 
beside me, said Bell, who drives for 
Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark. 
If it is dark, you watch where you 
walk. Were using more padlocks 
(on the "cargo doors) ... especially if 
you leave it overnight.
Many trucks are equipped with 
satellite systems that allow the com
panies to track trucks to within a 
couple of hundred feet. A truck 
going off course would arouse suspi
cion.
Truckers said they are getting 
more scrutiny from transportation 
officials at weigh stations, especially 
if they are carrying hazardous mate
rials.
In New York, where workers are 
still sifting through the rubble of the 
World Trade Center, police have 
been checking documents and 
inventory on all vans and trucks 
entering Manhattan, a process that 
often slows traffic to a crawl.
Truck stops have also tightened 
security. Workers monitor parking 
lots more closely and they lock doors 
that used to be left unlocked, said 
Melvin DeBruhl, general manager of 
the Cordele truck stop.
At the Jack Rabbit Travel Center 
in Albany, Ga., trucker Perry L. 
McDaniel used his satellite system to 
check in with his company, Swift 
Transportation of Phoenix, Ariz. 
Since September 11, he uses a 
stronger lock on the trailer doors 
and he checks in at every stop.
McDaniel, a 25-year-old licensed 
hazardous material driver from 
Mobile, Ala., flipped through warn
ing placards on the back of his trail
er  explosive, poisonous, flamma
ble, corrosive, radioactive.
The thing that worries us most is 
our hazmat loads, he said. You 
dont know if ... this placard could 
make you a target.
Philippine food court bomb leaves six people dead
ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP)  
A powerful bomb tore through a food 
court Sunday, killing at least six peo
ple and injuring 53 others while US 
military officers were in town to dis
cuss helping the government fight 
Muslim rebels.
Philippine authorities blamed the 
Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf, 
which allegedly has links to Osama 
bin Laden, for the blast in the restive 
southern city of Zamboanga.
The Americans were unhurt in the 
early evening attack, officials said. 
They were staying at a tightly guard
ed military camp a few miles from the 
site of the explosion, said Lt. Gen. Roy 
Cimatu, who heads the Philippine
military's Southern Command.
Interior Secretary Joey Lina said 
the signs indicate that the Abu Sayyaf 
planted the bomb in retaliation for a 
military campaign against the group 
on nearby Basilan island.
The Abu Sayyaf members are 
behind this bombing although we 
have not exactly pinpointed who, 
Lina told ABS-CBN television 
Monday morning.
The Philippine government sus
pects the Abu Sayyaf of carrying out 
other recent bombings in 
Zamboanga as a diversion from the 
military offensive.
The US officers were here for talks 
, on how the United States can help the
Philippine government fight the Abu 
Sayyaf.
The rebels are holding American 
missionaries Martin and Gracia 
Burnham of Wichita, Kan., and 10 
Filipinos on Basilan. They claim they 
killed a third American, Guillermo 
Sobero of Corona, Calif. The three 
Americans were kidnapped from a 
resort in May.
Medical workers said at least 53 
people were hospitalized after the 
blast, which happened about 8 pm at 
the crowded open-air plaza in 
Zamboanga, on Mindanao island 
520 miles south of Manila. Police said 
a second bomb was found outside 
and safely detonated.
Witnesses at the food court said 
they saw bloodied people lying on 
the ground after the blast, which 
shattered windows in a mall across 
the street. Shoppers stampeded out 
of the mall.
There was this bag that suddenly 
went off and in the next second, 
everybody fell to the ground, said 
Junie Santos, an employee at one of 
the food shops in the court.
The US military advisers have been 
arriving in Zamboanga in small 
groups since Thursday. On Sunday, 
they returned there for the night after 
being flown by helicopter to Basilan, 
where Abu Sayyaf where Abu Sayyaf 
guerrillas are holding the hostages.

actor nearby and interviewed 
him. He admitted to drinking a 
few beers and knocking down 
the male after the male yelled 
obscenities at him for no reason. 
The actor was issued a citation for 
disorderly conduct and underage 
consumption; the victim was 
issued a citation for underage 
consumption.
Disorderly Conduct
10/16/01, 1:00 pm  Two offi
cers responded to a report of an 
irate elderly male at the Tech 
Garage. The officers found the 
male escorted by a younger male. 
They stated that the older male 
was a professor and that his car 
had been towed. His car had been 
parked in a hazardous position 
and towed earlier that morning. A 
Parking Services employee found 
him wandering the garage and led 
him to the Parking Office. The 
Parking Services employee stated 
after calling his wife, the actor 
reached across the table and 
grabbed at her and pulled her 
shoulders while kicking the desk. 
She did not report any injuries but 
did not appreciate being touched. 
Both males were allowed to leave.
Suspicious Substance 
10/17/01, 8:12 am  Three 
officers responded to a report of a
suspicious white substance scat
tered on the stairwell of West 
Wing. The white powdery sub
stance was accompanied by multi
ple pieces of white matter roughly 
an inch across. An officer made 
contact with a large piece with his 
uniform boot causing it to break 
apart. Based on this behavior and 
other observations, the substance 
was deemed to be a styrofoambased drywall material. No fur
ther action was taken.
Institutional Vandalism 
10/17/01, 8:03 pm  A
University Center employee noti
fied police that the elevator near 
Entropy had sustained new dam
age in the form of graffiti. 
Damage to this elevator is an 
ongoing problem; in this incident, 
words including Bitch Jane had 
been inscribed in the paint by a 
sharp object. The responding offi
cer informed the University 
Center employee that a sign stat
ing that the elevator will be moni
tored in the future could be post
ed.
Suspicious letter,
10/17/01, 2:46 pm  An offi
cer was dispatched to the 
Presidents office for a report of a 
suspicious letter. A receptionist in 
the office explained that while
opening the days mail, she came 
across a handwritten letter that 
was difficult to read, but included 
the words bio-terrorism, vac
cines, Squirrel Hill, and Osama 
Bin-Laden. The letter had a 
Pittsburgh postmark, with no 
return address, and it was not 
signed. The letter was turned over 
to city police for investigation.
Outside Assistance
10/19/01, 1:35 am  Two
males approached campus police 
and stated that they had been in a 
car accident and one of the pair 
had sustained injuries that 
required medical attention. When 
pressed, the males revealed that 
they had been drinking at a local 
restaurant earlier in the evening 
with friends. The males entered a 
car driven by a friend. The actor 
was driving past CMU on 
Schenley Drive when he lost con
trol of the vehicle and crossed the 
double yellow lines. The vehicle 
performed a 360-degree spin and 
then hit a tree. Severe damage 
was sustained to the rear of the 
vehicle. Officers investigating the 
site of the crash found skid marks 
over 100 feet in length. City of 
Pittsburgh police were notified 
and the wrecked vehicle was 
towed. The injured victim was 
transported to UPMC
Presbyterian.
Verbal Altercation
10/23/01, 7:13 am  A CMU
security guard notified police that 
an altercation was occurring 
between two CPS employees. The 
actor admitted to telling the vic
tim If you ever talk to me again, 
you will be in big trouble. Im not 
threatening you, Im telling you. 
A supervisor noted that the victim 
had stated he was going to do an 
EOOE on him (apparently a mili
tary style maneuver). The actor 
informed police that he was a 
member of the US Army and the 
victim was a member of the US 
National Guard, so animosity 
between the two on the subject of 
military differences was present. 
He also stated that the two have 
verbal spats all the time and will 
probably be speaking to each 
other again in a few days. No fur
ther action was taken.
Research Scam 10/23/01, 
5:08 pm  A staff member of 
the Psychology Department called 
police to report two phone calls 
she had received. The staff mem
ber was not available for com
ment, but another staff member 
informed police that the callers 
claimed to be Pitt students investi
gating the validity of a research
project allegedly being conducted 
at CMU involving women and 
masturbation. Apparently a male 
is telling female Pitt students he is 
employed as a photographer by 
the CMU Psychology Department 
to shoot women nude while mas
turbating. Interested women are 
to call a particular voice mail 
number and schedule an appoint
ment. The male is reported to 
have very official looking 
release forms to be signed by the 
females involved. A representa
tive from the Psychology 
Department stated that no such 
research was being conducted at 
CMU.
- Campus Sergeant Budzick 
reviews all reports prior to release.
- Only four people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the Editors-inChief, the News Editor, and the 
staffwriter typing the report.
- All personal names of com
plainants, victims, suspects, and 
fraternities are omitted from the 
printed report. Ethnic descriptions 
and other personal details are given 
only in the context of complete 
descriptions.
- Not every incident that occurs 
appears in the report.

Environmental festival could 
improve conservation at CMU
Students at Carnegie Mellon too often lose 
sight of environmental issues affecting them. 
While paper usage has likely decreased as a 
result of amazing advances in technology, 
consumption of energy has by no means gone 
down. Energy Fest 2001 helped to put ener
gy usage and consumption in perspective 
with a smorgasbord of presentations and 
exhibits. Today, preserving the environment 
should be one of everyones top priorities. 
Energy Fest comes on the heels of a decision 
by the University to purchase a portion of its 
electricity from the wind farm in nearby Mill 
Run.
The vendors of Energy Fest 2001 represent
ed a variety of perspectives from educational 
groups to groups dedicated to active defense 
of the environment. One of the more interest
ing groups was made up of CMU born envi
ronmental aspects, who try to influence 
University decisions to be more environmen
tally friendly. This group influenced heavily 
the decision to purchase wind power at 
Carnegie Mellon. Their next project will be 
Campus Challenge, which will aim to involve 
students more directly in environmental con
servation. The challenge will essentially be a 
contest between dorms on who can save the 
most energy. The winning dorm will most like
ly get a monetary award or some sort of recog
nition, but the contest will hopefully also be a 
boon to Carnegie Mellons drive to become 
more environmentally friendly. The project 
will promote grass-root efforts amongst stu
dents, so that conservation can also take place 
from the ground up, rather than just from the 
top down. Unfortunately, a walk among the 
various exhibitors revealed that the demo
graphics of those directly participating in 
Energy Fest were greatly skewed as the major
ity of the individuals at Energy Fest 01 were
not students. The environment should be an 
issue that all are concerned about, especially 
younger people like Carnegie Mellon stu
dents.
Energy Fest organizers should be comple
mented on their efforts to involve students who 
might not otherwise have participated  Coal 
Train performed during the festivities to the 
delight of many. Their music certainly provid
ed Energy Fest with a more lively atmosphere.
The last part of the program included lec
tures by notable guest speakers on a variety of 
important environmental issues. Some of the 
more interesting presentations included dis
cussions by a student who presented his class 
project, which was a spin-off of the Kyoto 
Accords. The Kyoto Accords aimed to involve 
many nations throughout the world  indus
trialized and developing  to aim to cut pol
lution emissions by 10 percent. Unfortunately, 
the United States refused to sign the Kyoto 
Accords, preventing its passage. The students 
project operates on the premise that the 
Carnegie Mellon community represents the 
US to see if the community is able to cut emis
sions from our University by 10 percent as the 
Kyoto Accords dictates. Almost everything the 
community does on campus adds to the 
regions pollution, from the natural gas used 
for cooking, to the power plants off campus 
that produce our electricity. The project itself 
is very ambitious and hopefully will come to 
full fruition.
The event itself, however, lacked somewhat 
in scope; the conference would have been bet
ter if it didnt focus on a single environmental 
issue but rather a broader spectrum. Having an 
all inclusive environmental conference would 
have probably attracted even more individuals 
to the already high turnout of Energy Fest 01.

End game: plus/minus grades 
no good for final report cards
fstiirlpntc at Parnpcrip Mpllnn arp hprp tn thp nliis/minns sralp in atnpral T.asStudents at Carnegie Mellon are here to 
learn first, and earn grades second. 
Inevitably, along with the education and 
learning comes an evaluation of our perfor
mance in our classes through a grading sys
tem. The most recent and positive develop
ment was the implementation of the 
plus/minus system for mid-semester grades, 
which were released last week. The new sys
tem though must only be used for mid-semester grades and not for final grades.
This added dimension to the assessment of 
our grades is a positive step in providing 
more feedback to students about their acade
mic performance. By seeing a grade of a C + 
or an A-, an individual can gauge his or her 
aptitude in a course more precisely and plan 
the effort required to achieve a grade to his 
or her satisfaction by the end of the semester. 
Since mid-semester grades do not factor into 
the final QPA, this amendment shows to stu
dents their progress more accurately while 
not increasing levels of stress or competition 
among students. It is therefore in the stu
dents best interest to employ this new grad
ing scale for mid-semester grades but not for 
final grades.
While the use of this new system came as a 
surprise to many students when they checked 
their grades online, the debate over the use of 
the plus/minus scale is not a new issue. 
Initially, the current scale without the 
plus/minus grades was called into question 
about nine years ago by faculty who wanted to 
give students more accurate feedback based 
on their performance and effort, and the sys
tem has been disputed ever since. This con
cern surfaced again during the 1999-2000 
school year and was discussed in Student 
Senate. Research from a survey conducted by 
the Academic Affairs chair at the time, Erin 
Fitzgerald, discovered that undergraduate 
students were strongly against implementing
the plus/minus scale in general. Last fall, 
action was taken regarding this matter when 
the Academic Affairs chair, Adam Harber, and 
music professor Marilyn Thomas presented a 
plan to only apply the plus/minus scale for 
mid-semester grades starting this semester. 
During the discussion, the faculty strongly 
pushed for the immediate application of the 
plus/minus system to final grades, but 
Student Senate representatives pushed for a 
trial period of the system for only mid-semester grades. Members of the Academic Affairs 
committee reasoned that the plus/minus sys
tem provides better feedback at mid-semester 
when students can still work to improve a 
grade, rather than when the semester is over 
and when the grade will be a precise evalua
tion of performance. They accepted also that 
students were strongly against using the scale 
for final grades.
Currently, graduate students at Carnegie 
Mellon receive plus/minus grades and under
graduate students are receiving plus/minus 
grades at mid-semester as part of a three 
semester trial period. After the trial period 
ends next fall semester, the University 
Education Council, headed by Vice Provost of 
Education, Indira Nair, and comprised of facul
ty and student representatives, will review the 
success or failure of the system. The options at 
the end of the trial period include instituting 
the system for final grades, continuing to only 
use plus/minus marks for mid-semester grades, 
or getting rid of the plus/minus system alto
gether.
Implementing the plus/minus grading scale 
for final grades would only increase competi
tion and strain in the intense academic envi
ronment at CMU. However, using the 
plus/minus system simply for mid-semester 
allows faculty to give students better feedback 
without adverse effects of plus/minus final 
grades.

Public deserves details on anthrax scare
David M. Anderson
What to do, what to do? That is a ques
tion I am assuming many people are ask
ing themselves as we see and hear about 
anthrax, smallpox, and plague anytime 
we read a newspaper or turn on the TV. I 
received the spamming emails that want 
me to buy my own personal stash of 
Cipro, I have seen advertisements for 100 
percent safe, Israeli Army approved gas
masks for only $149.99, and I have seen 
my neighbors put on yellow latex dish
washing gloves every time they go to get 
their mail. So what should we know, and 
what should we do about the threat 
of bioterrorism?
The most important thing we as a 
nation should do is get good information 
so we can make decisions that are ratio
nal. Unfortunately, it has been a difficult 
task to receive accurate and timely infor
mation from the government. Tom Ridge, 
the new Homeland Defense czar, has 
repeatedly contradicted himself when he 
speaks about the status and nature of 
anthrax found in the post offices in 
Washington and New York and in the 
offices of Senator Daschle. He is not the 
only government official to have contra
dicted himself concerning this issue. 
Health and Human Services Secretary, 
Tommy Thompson, stated that the United 
States had adequate antibiotic stockpiles 
and then requests ten million more full 
treatments worth of Cipro. Additionally 
he has said that some of the anthrax was 
not dangerous, while at the same time, 
Ridge and other government officials 
have said that the same case of anthrax 
was finely ground and weaponized.
Information from the government is 
critical so that we can make smart choic
es. However, we are not receiving this 
information. The government seems to 
think that we are not able or capable of 
intelligently processing basic personal 
health and security choices. I can under
stand the desire not to panic people by 
exaggerating the strength or weaknesses 
of a biological agent, but when officials 
do not know, or are waiting for tests to 
come back from the lab, that is what they 
should say. At this moment, I am unsure 
of the nature of the anthrax sample, we 
have sent it to the lab and we should have 
results in X amount of hours or days. 
The American public can handle that. We 
know that anthrax and bioterrorism are 
complicated and difficult subjects, so we 
let the experts handle it.
Yet this administration has decided 
that the American public is not worthy of 
information that might make people 
question their personal risk assessments 
and behavior. Presidential spokesman,Ari
Fleischer, has repeatedly stated that there 
are limits on what non-classified informa
tion we should know, and also that jour
nalists should be careful about what they 
say, even if that information is non-classi
fied and not threatening the lives or well
being of American soldiers or civilians. I 
can completely understand the govern
ment wanting silence on the actual tac
tics, techniques and timing of military 
operations, for I do not want my friends 
in the military to die or to mourn their 
friends. But the administration wishes to 
completely control the official opinion by 
directing information flows concern
ing bioterrorism.
Unfortunately, this is not the only 
instance in which this administration 
does not believe that the public has a 
right to the truth. For instance, the tax 
cut that was passed this spring was first 
created in the fall of 1999. It was sold to 
the public as a means of ensuring con
tinual prosperity and budget surpluses, 
and it was sold to Bush as a means of 
cementing the Republican right away 
from Steve Forbes. However, when the 
economy started to slow down during 
the beginning of this year, Bush and his 
administration submitted fundamental
ly the same proposal to Congress as a 
recession-fighting measure.
This is not the only case of outright 
duplicity or deception practiced by 
senior members of this administration. 
Interior Secretary Gale Norton has twist
ed facts and numbers from a study con
ducted by the US Fish and Wildlife ser
vices. The study demonstrated that cari
bou herds were affected by existing oil
...this is not the only 
instance in which this 
administration does 
not believe that the 
public has a right to 
the truth.
developments on the North Slope of 
Alaska. Norton dismissed these findings 
and said to Congress that all evidence 
from her department showed that oil 
drilling was completely beneficial to 
these herds. Then there are the stories of 
Clinton staffers trashing the White 
House before leaving that turned out to 
be false; the damage was normal wear 
and tear to be expected after an office 
has been occupied for eight years, as 
reported by the Government Accounting 
Office investigation. Finally, on 
September 11, President Bush took Air
Force One on a cross country trek, land
ing at Barksdale Air Force Base, 
Louisiana, and Offut Air Force Base in 
Nebraska, before returning to 
Washington DC later that night. His aides 
stated that Air Force One was a specific 
target of the attack, although all reports 
and investigations after the fact showed 
that there was no indication of such an 
attack was planned. I can understand the 
Secret Service being reasonably para
noid and wanting to be able to protect 
the president by using mobility and 
secrecy in this case, but I can not under
stand why the Bush administrations first 
instinct is to lie and deceive the 
American public on an issue where a sim
ple statement of truth would be much 
more reassuring. The only explanation I 
can imagine is that the Bush administra
tion holds the average American in con
tempt and also fears that the truth can 
make Bush look less than presidential 
(which is not that hard, given his malapropisms, blank looks, and unusual elec
tion) .
So what should we do as individuals 
about bioterrorism? That is a good ques
tion, and I am not an expert, but here are 
my thoughts. The first thing that we 
should do is take better care of our
selves, especially here at CMU; sleep is a 
good thing, and so is breakfast not exclu
sively consisting of stale Pop-Tarts and 
coffee. After we get more than six hours 
of sleep a night for a week straight, we 
should also realize that we have a 
greater risk of dying from a lightning 
strike than from anthrax at this moment. 
So we should take adequate precautions, 
but not freak out if there are no more 
latex gloves at Phar-Mor. These precau
tions are simple; dont send any hoax 
threats (the FBI really does not like that, 
no sense of humor), pay attention to 
your health, and call in any suspicious 
powders falling out of letters and mail 
that you receive. These things take a 
total of 30 seconds a day, so do it, then 
tell your parents not to worry  you are 
doing what you should be doing.
Finally, make sure to question the 
governments story, especially this one 
as it has proven credibility problems. Be 
prepared to spend a couple of minutes 
thinking about what is being reported 
by mainstream sources, and also a cou
ple of minutes thinking about what is 
not being reported, and why. Be pre
pared to be called unpatriotic or antiAmerican if you question the herd at 
this time. Be prepared to have people 
call you names when you introduce a 
different and less popular analysis. Be 
prepared to question even as you sup
port this country.

America does have room for conservatism
Suneal Chandran
Conservatism. It brings to mind 
Adam Smith, John Locke, and Ronald 
Reagan. It conjures up images of free
dom, self-determination, and peace. 
And it represents much of what is suc
cessful in American life and in govern
ment policy. But Andy Baker, in his 
article for the last issue of The Tartan, 
seemed to disagree. Mr. Baker, with all 
due respect, took a very narrow-minded, and in some cases, just plain wrong, 
view of conservatism. Jerry Falwell 
and the Christian right represent only 
one part of the conservative move
ment. I am Hindu, and dont always 
agree with everything Rev. Falwell and 
Pat Robertson say, although, as a 
believer in free speech, I respect their 
views and their right to express them. I 
think Pat Buchanan and many others 
who call themselves conservatives are 
nutcases. But, believe it or not, I am a 
conservative. And Im proud of it.
The narrow-minded view of conser
vatism is that it gives to the rich at the 
expense of the poor, demands more 
government intervention in a persons 
life, and is generally intolerant of any
one who isnt a straight, wealthy, male 
WASP. Yeah, and conservatives steal 
candy from babies, too. Oh my God! 
This actually is just the opposite of 
what conservatives believe. The truth 
is that conservatism is based on a few
simple ideas  that all people are cre
ated equal and should have an equal 
shot at achieving their dreams, that 
they have certain natural rights (life, 
liberty, property, the pursuit of happi
ness, etc.) that should be protected by 
government, and that no institution 
should stand in the way of them doing 
so. Humans are driven by self-interest. 
They want the most gain for them
selves. Conservatives design policies 
and institutions (i.e. democracy and 
capitalism) that allow self-interest to 
work for the benefit of all. And the 
beauty of it is that these ideas work. 
Just try to convince me that democracy 
and capitalism dont lead to more free
dom and a higher quality of life. 
Just try to convince any reasonable

work a prospect into a lead. 
Tarry too long while reading a 
sign, and good ole Mark (or Ward, 
or Ed, or Jack) will shake your 
hand and try to drag you into the 
booth for some shop talk.
I imagine that most readers 
have not had the pleasure of 
working a trade show. The astute 
reader will note that I said work
ing not going to. Standing 
inside the booth presents a com
pletely different view than that of 
wandering through a trade show 
with a visitor tag. As a public ser
vice, Ill let you future salespeople 
know what youre in for. Technical 
people should pay attention, too, 
since the sales and marketing peo
ple often begrudgingly drag 
them along to answer highly tech
nical questions like, So how 
much chromate is in your nonchromate coating?
A couple weeks ago, I attended 
Rubber Expo 2001 in Cleveland, 
sponsored by the rubber division 
of the American Chemical Society 
(ACS). Now, I know what most of 
you sickos are already thinking: 
What they hell possessed you to go
to Cleveland with some chemists? 
Unfortunately, thats where they 
held it. I ask my fellow chemical 
engineers to forgive me for associ
ating with that most lowly of life 
forms, the chemist.
The rest of you sickos are proba
bly wondering if the Rubber Expo 
was some strange fetish conven
tion. No, it wasnt. This show was 
all about rubbers. They had ven
dors who could color your rub
bers; vendors who helped you 
make your rubbers stretch better; 
vendors with equipment to test 
how hard your rubbers were; and 
vendors who provided equipment 
to turn your rubbers into all types 
of shapes.
The trade show also held numer
ous technical sessions that dealt 
with rubbers and their properties. 
Some people talked about how
cracks propagated through rub
bers. Others presented research 
on making rubbers. Yours truly 
presented a paper on a new envi
ronmentally friendly technology 
that helps your rubber stick to 
your piece.
Part of my job included work
ing the booth. In this role, I sat on 
my chair at my companys booth 
and talked to people who were 
interested in our products. This 
job was particularly boring, 
thanks to Osama and friends. The 
trade show predicted over 10,000 
participants. However, thanks to 
the economy and the terrorist 
attacks, only 5,000 showed up. 
Things were very thin, but we did 
manage to meet with some very 
important customers and part
ners. Our paper also generated a 
great deal of interest.
When youre working the booth 
and bored, you pass time in one of 
several ways: talking to your fel
low employees about other fellow 
employees who arent there, talk
ing to your fellow employees 
about family members who arent 
there, and talking to your fellow
employees about competitors who 
are at the trade show but at their 
own booths talking about you and 
your fellow employees.
You also watch people. My 
favorite groups to watch are sales
people and, of course, the people

What did you do over mid-semester break?
But, Seriously...
8oi wWSE mNEntr
Thats it, I give up. This semester is shot. Far too many 
heinous things have gone down over the past couple of 
months for me to just shrug it off and keep on keepin on. Im 
out. Im gone. Im Casper. Poof. I suggest you all do the same. 
Its time to drop to your knees, say your prayers, stick your 
head between your legs, and kiss your ass goodbye.
Yep, Im cashing in my chips and relocating to some isolat
ed section of the vast northeastern wilderness to set up camp. 
Ive had enough of this cold, complicated world weve managed 
to construct for ourselves. I simply dont have the stomach for 
it anymore. Im going to build me a log cabin, stock it with food 
and liquor, surround it with a fifteen foot concrete wall coated 
with razor wire and sharpened electrified spikes. Come near it 
and Ill sic the dogs on you. That is, if you dont get a belly full 
of buckshot first. Ill dig in and fire randomly into the darkness 
at anything that makes a sound.
In all honesty, it wasnt the wounded economy, the terrorist 
attack, the anthrax outbreaks, or the cessation of M*A*S*H 
reruns on FX that prompted this decision. I came to it gradual
ly through a great deal of careful thought and introspection. 
After all, Im hardly one to make brash, uninformed decisions 
and accusations without a shred of proof. You all know me bet
ter than that.
In the end, sports did it to me. After things hit the fan 
seven weeks ago, I turned to professional sports for comfort.
In my time of need, I sought solace on the gridiron, the dia
mond, and the rink. After all, if we, as a thoroughly advanced 
society, cant be distracted by gladiatorial throwbacks based 
on hopes of extreme personal injury to all involved, we 
are lost.
Just look at how much of a mess the sporting world has made 
of itself. The four horsemen are on their way, friends, and it wont 
be pretty. The fat is in the fire.
Take baseball, for instance. Sure, Im as happy as the next 
yinzer that the Braves are currently playing golf and taking 
turns polishing Ted Turners knob, but what will the series 
bring? The Yankees, gold-plated toads that they are, will 
inevitably thrash the Diamondbacks thoroughly and merciless- j 
ly in a grand salute to everything that baseball shouldnt con
done: an overemphasized, overpaid, overrated dynasty that 
exists solely because its greater metropolitan area holds more 
people than any other.
And dont give me that good personnel crap. Yes, several 
of their big guns, namely Petite, Jeter, and Soriano, were all 
brought up through their farm system. But too much of their 
roster exists because theyve got more money than God and can 
either buy great players straight out or strongarm other clubs 
into coughing up their own. My amusement with the situation 
is derived from knowing that itll cost the Yanks hundreds of 
millions of dollars to beat a bunch of geriatrics like Grace and 
Williams and Johnson. Screw the Yankees.
On to football. While Im not one to complain about the first 
place Steelers running over anything foolish enough to stand in 
their way, Id like to see more out of the rest of the league. No 
matter how well the first place Steelers might be doing at any 
given time, I am still a fan of football in general. I want to see 
fast-paced, hard-hitting, balls-to-the-wall games. Long bombs, 
fourth quarter rallies, spleen-severing tackles, and snow. Lots 
of snow.
Aside from the first place Steelers, the Bears, and the filthy 
Browns, the rest of the league might as well pack it up. Sure,
St. Louis puts up four hundred points a game, but that means 
dick come January, as we all saw last year. Plus, Faulks hurt. 
The Colts have gone to hell, the Raiders are lackluster in their 
better moments, the Broncos wont do anything for a decade, 
last years Super Bowl teams are a combined 6-6, and the 
Patriots are about as useful as a condom to a CS major.
Which brings us to hockey. The Pens thus far are dangling 
along at .500, and are having a hard time replacing the sheer 
scoring power offered by that whiny Jagr. This, I expected. But 
whats going on elsewhere? For Christs sake, the Islanders lead 
the Atlantic, Boston is on top in the Northeast, and the best team 
in the Western Conference is Calgary. Detroit, for all the money 
theyve spent, havent shown anybody anything, and the Devils 
might as well aim for a high draft pick.
These are dark times, both for our nation and our sports. 
Most of all, Im losing money on these unpredictable bastards 
and Im sick of it. No more. Im leaving. Cancel my magazine 
subscriptions, call my folks, tell my boss I died, and point a 
good, hearty middle finger in that pompous Jesuit Dean 
Murphys direction the next time you see him. Im bound for 
glory and isolationism. Keep well.
Sean Mintus is a junior professional and creative writing major. 
No, hes not really leaving, and if anyone fails to recognize that this 
article was written based on statistics that were valid three days ago, 
but might not be at present, they should throw themselves into

A8THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 29, 2001
Conservativism is not Christianity: 
Critics should not confuse ideologies
Mark Adamson
Of Andy Bakers column, No vacancy: American demo
cratic Society has no room for conservatism in the 
October 15, 2001 Tartan, I have to say that Mr. Baker is 
confusing ideologies. He is taking Christian dogma and 
applying it to the entire political spectrum that lies to his 
right. Conservatism is not Christianity. He points to 
extremists of conservatism as if they were the conserva
tive norm, quoting the likes of Pat Robertson and Jesse 
Helms. Those men are at the very outer edge of conser
vatism, and Catholicism for that matter, and are poor rep
resentatives of what conservatism is about. He may as 
well point to the Lamborghini Countach and claim, Cars 
are too expensive these days.
I consider myself a conservative when the choice is 
liberal or conservative, but I also consider myself a 
libertarian when the choices are authoritarian or lib
ertarian. This means that in matters of economic poli
tics, I believe that people should take responsibility for 
their own income, corporations should have a fair 
amount of freedom from government intervention, and I 
disbelieve in the structured economies espoused by Marx 
and Stalin. In matters of social politics, I am a strong lib
ertarian, meaning my personal life is of no concern what
soever to the state, and I may practice what religion I like, 
think what I want, and speak those opinions freely. 
It is this libertarianism that was set up by the founding 
fathers, limiting the federal governments to 
infrastructure of the nation such as coining money and a 
court system.
My conservatism is not tied to Christianity. I am not a 
Christian. The six tenets of conservatism that Mr. Baker 
lists are mostly Christian dogma, not conservatism. 
Oppression of homosexuality comes out of the Vatican 
(although not out of the Bible, I might point out). 
Unification of the church and state is, obviously, a reli
gious matter. Censorship is a heavy authoritarian matter, 
and all sides are guilty of this just look at the article on 
page A4 of the October 15, 2001 Tartan in which the stu
dent senate at Berkeley is attempting to censor a cartoon. 
If Mr. Baker can find a place further left than Berkeley, he 
is welcome to move there. Number four on his list was the 
curtailment of civil liberties, another authoritarian doc
trine that is practiced by people in power who wish to 
remain in power, not just conservatives. The liberal left is 
rife with examples of violations of civil liberties, includ
ing Waco, Texas; Ruby Ridge; the Elian Gonzales case; 
and Tipper Gores iron fist in the music industry. The next 
claim that conservatism attempts to discard science such 
as evolutionism in favor of creationism is just more 
Christian evangelism. The liberal left does not hold a
monopoly on the advance of science. Are Dow Chemical, 
NASA, and Westinghouse all bastions of liberal doctrine? 
And lastly, Mr. Baker is somehow disgusted by the con
servatives wanting to trim the bloated government 
bureaucracy. I dont understand why he is against this, 
but if against it he is, he must be in favor of more bloat
ed government bureaucracy. Canada has plenty of that, 
and Mr. Baker is free to move there.
The strict definition of conservatism says that it is 
about appreciating existing institutions and not leaping 
into change. The word is more often associated with the 
economic right, toward capitalism and, at the extreme, 
objectivism, and away from the state-run economy of Karl 
Marxs communism. I am an economic conservative, in 
that I feel the welfare system is out of control, I would 
like to stop paying into Social Security, I utterly hate the 
modern implementation of unions, and I think there is 
too much involvement of government in corporations. 
However I am also a moderate, in that I think that welfare 
has a place for people faced with sudden economic disas
ters, it just shouldnt be a lifestyle; unions are a good idea, 
but they have become too powerful now and garbage men 
should not be making the salaries they do; and corpora
tions cannot be trusted to run themselves because they 
tend to become very shortsighted, and dumping industri
al sewage into the river upstream from the school play
ground starts looking profitable. Mr. Baker said in the 
title of his article that there is no room for conservatism 
in America. Are these conservative views unacceptable 
in his America? Im no liberal  ask anyone who knows 
me  and Im disturbed that he feels I have no place 
in America.
A better title for his article would have been No 
vacancy: American democratic society has no room for 
authoritarian and religious extremists, because he is 
only quoting from those two camps. But unfortunately 
those views do have a place in America. The greatest bur
den of freedom is tolerating the existence of contrary 
opinions. People in this country have the right to hold 
extremist opinions, and Mr. Baker is showing his intol
erance of them. There will always be a spectrum of opin
ions, and the people at the outer edges are extremists. 
Jane Fonda, Louis Farrakhan, and A1 Gore all hold opin
ions that are extremist left that I think are dangerous to 
this country, but they have the right to their opinion. If 
Andy Baker dislikes anti-abortionism, creationism, and 
anti-gay agendas then he is free to not go to Christian 
churches. If he wants a government less intrusive into the 
social life of citizens he should vote for congressional can
didates from the American Libertarian Party. And if he 
doesnt like the political state of this country, he is wel
come to leave.

Tricks of the trade: work a show like a pro
RESTIFO, from page A7
walking the floor and looking for
product information.
Salespeople provide a modern day 
nature show where mankind is the 
star. Ever see one of those nature 
shows where the male bird fluffs up 
all his plumage in an attempt to lure 
a mate? Thats these salespeople. 
Its hysterical.
Theyre always trying to out-do 
each other. If attendance is great, 
they talk about all the leads theyre 
getting. Even if its a small amount, 
they rationalize it. When someone 
tells a sales person he or she got 100 
leads, that person simply responds, 
Well, we only wrote 50, but we pret
ty much hit all the people at the show 
who look for our products. The tell
tale sign that business is slow is the 
golden lie: We didnt write many 
leads, but the leads were all great. 
Yeah, all two of them.
Prospective customers, however, 
provide the most entertainment (and 
sometimes the most frustration). 
Most of them have no clue whats 
going on. Every now and then, a 
good one will walk up. He or she has 
a problem, explains it, and asks if you 
can help. If so, you trade contact 
information, talk about the problem, 
and go from there. If not, they leave. 
Like I said, pure, raw capitalism.
The others, though, geez! 
Lobotomized monkeys on valium 
could do a better job. They walk up to 
your booth, read the signs that show 
all the products you make, and then 
say, So what do you guys do? One
of these days Im going to grab this 
type of person by the neck, drag him 
or her over to the sign, shout out 
every word on the sign with a slight 
pause between each one for dramatic 
effect, throw the person back out into 
the aisle, and then say very quietly in 
a Christopher Walken voice, Now ... 
buddy-boy, do you ... have any more 
questions ... about what I do? I 
wont forget the half squint.
Not all aisle-monkeys are that frus
trating, however. Some provide much 
needed relief from the boredom. At 
one point, the obvious owner of a 
company walked through the trade

colleague and said,

ter than a mistress is

the trade show and 
write it off.
floor with several of his employees. 
They all wore the same shirt with the 
same logo, and they all had the pre
requisite bag of promotional junk 
that most companies hand out.
One employee, however, stood 
out. She was obviously much younger
than the owner. She walked very 
closely to him, her face a mixture of 
both boredom and confusion at this 
stuff about rubbers. She was not 
dressed like the others, opting 
instead for a more casual look.
I turned to my colleague and said, 
The only thing better than a mistress 
is a tax-deductible mistress. Take her 
to the trade show and write it off as a 
business expense. Those future CEOs 
out there know that the only thing 
better than that is a tax-deductible 
mistress with low depreciation.
I could go on and on for pages. 
There was the vendor across the aisle 
representing a company from a for
mer Soviet republic. We spent a great 
deal of time trying to figure out how 
to pronounce Nizhnekamskneftekhim. 
(I am not making this up.) There was 
also the sales person at another near
by vendor who would greedily rub 
his hands together, hoping to see 
another of his buddies so he could 
slap their backs and pump their 
hands. A fellow booth prisoner aptly 
described him as a gnat.
And that, my friends, is a trade 
show. So if you find yourself at the 
same trade show as me, come by my 
booth. I promise not to bite. Unless, 
of course, you take five minutes to 
read our booth signs and then ask me 
how acidic our alkaline cleaners are.

Fighting with blinders on
Aseem Garag
The Tartan Forum page over the last few 
weeks has become the site of an ideological 
battle. Headlines like Liberals need to 
think twice, realize theyre part of the prob
lem and others score the previous pages 
with their self-congratulating, blame-filled 
propaganda.
The basic problem with such articles is 
that they tend to vent their frustrations not 
at those who are guilty of specific crimes 
(actual terrorists and criminals) but instead 
at those who are their ideological enemies 
(conservatives, liberals, libertarians, etc.).
Who is responsible for the acts of terror
ism against the United States? The people 
who executed and organized the terrorist 
attacks. It was not the fault of Presidents 
George Bush Sr. or Jr., Senator Paul 
Wellstone, or the Koran.
The central precept of justice is that one 
can be guilty only for ones own actions. A 
teenager who shoots his classmates, a mili
tary commander (Talibanist, American, 
Russian, Communist, Fundamentalist, or 
insane) who knowingly orders his men to 
attack civilians, or a leader who calls for 
indiscriminate killings to make a political 
point all bear responsibilities for their indi
vidual actions. The teenagers classmates, 
the military commanders father, and the 
leaders religion bear no responsibility for 
those specific actions.
There can be no justice, great or small, in 
a world in which blame is spread indiscrim
inately against those who disagree with 
ones self. In a just world, civilians do not 
pay for the crimes of their leaders, the mur
der of innocent children is considered the 
worst evil imaginable, and a person pays the 
price of his/her own actions.
In our real world of ideological warfare, 
civilians always pay for the crimes of their 
leaders, the murder of children is euphemized 
as collateral damage, and people refuse to 
acknowledge the price and moral implications 
of their own actions. After all, its my political 
opponents fault that I killed his family.
Its time to start fessin up. The United 
States government has helped topple demo
cratic regimes (Guatemala 1954) and delib
erately killed children (Tokyo 1945). This 
should be acknowledged. It is our history 
and it is true. The Taliban is a regime that 
routinely massacres ethnic minorities and 
persecutes women. That is true. 
Palestinian terrorists often kill innocent 
Israeli citizens. The Israeli government 
often responds by attacks that end in the 
deaths of innocent Palestinians. That is 
also true. If the terrorists had been white 
supremacists, there would not be a racial 
profiling debate right now. That is only ide
ological speculation.
So I ask of my fellow students: take off 
your ideological blinders and take a look at 
the truth in all its complexity and glory. 
Take responsibility for your own actions and 
stop blaming everyone you disagree with for 
things they had nothing to do with. That

way, we might have a chance at finding 
true justice. And to borrow and modify 
the famous false dilemma fallacy, Either 
you are with me, or you disagree with 
me. Either way, Im not going to kill 
your family.

person that the American way of life
isnt the best.
But theory isnt everything; lets dis
cuss the individual policies Mr. Baker 
brought up. What about government 
opposing abortion? Well, government 
doesnt have a right or the responsibility 
to make medical decisions. But a funda
mental duty of any government is to proor pro-death. Your mother chose life  
shouldnt you? In fact, I just cannot 
understand at all the liberal point of 
view on human life. It is all right to mur
der an innocent baby, but it is wrong to 
use capital punishment, after following 
due process and a series of checks and 
balances, on a person who would merci
lessly murder others? I just dont get it. 
Liberals have applied this same twisted

tect life. What kind of civilized society 
would allow and even encourage out
right murder, what one recent movie 
called a Holocaust of the Unborn? 
Seems simple to me. Its either pro-life
logic (or, rather, lack of logic) to the cur
rent situation involving the war on ter
rorism. It is okay to murder thousands of 
innocent civilians, but it isnt okay to 
bring justice to those who perpetrated
it. Not only should we allow terrorists to 
continue planning and carrying out 
their attacks on innocent people, but we 
should also adapt our policies to their 
view of the world? Huh?
Lets get things straight  govern
ment has to protect the right to life (and 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) 
we all have. Civilized societies have a 
respect for the sanctity of human life. 
That doesnt mean government inter
vention is justified in everything. Thank 
you, Mr. Baker, for acknowledging this. 
Smaller government is better. But many 
liberals still disagree. Why is the federal 
government doing everything from run
ning a failing train service to planning 
peoples retirements to paying for new 
sidewalks in Podunk, PA? Government 
doesnt belong in these areas. Private 
industry can provide these services bet
ter and at a lower cost than any govern
ment agency. Logic, as well as history,
proves this point. Personally, I would 
rather decide for myself what I want to 
do with my hard-earned money instead 
of government deciding for me. 
Nationalized industries and socialism 
failed all around the world, and they 
will fail here too, but liberals dont want 
to heed these lessons. No, liberals 
would rather take all the money youve 
worked to earn and spend it on any
thing that is unnecessary and wasteful, 
anything that could be better done by 
someone else. It doesnt make sense. 
Why should someone in Pittsburgh 
finance a sidewalk in Honolulu? Why 
should someone in Honolulu fund a 
concert hall in Miami, someone in 
Miami pay for an airport in Anchorage, 
or someone in Anchorage support a tun
nel in Tulsa? This is what happens, and 
it is absurd. There is no justification. 
Reaganomics, supply-side policies, con
servative economics all work because
they draw on basic human instincts. As I 
said before, that is the beauty of capi
talism; it uses self-interest for the bene
fit of all.
And as far as civil liberties go, conser
vatives are totally for them. As a conser
vative, I do believe in allowing others to 
express their views, especially those 
who disagree with me. I believe in the 
free market of ideas as much as I believe 
in other free markets. Mr. Baker has the 
right to say whatever he wants about 
conservatives and liberals, even though 
he doesnt think the same courtesy 
should be extended to those of us on the 
right. But, thats okay; were going to 
rant on anyway.

Fan with Bonds HR ball speaks out
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  The 
fan who wound up with Barry 
Bonds 73rd home run ball said he 
didnt take the ball from another 
fan who temporarily caught it.
Patrick Hayashi ended up with 
the ball October 7, and is being 
sued by Alex Popov, who caught 
the ball but lost it when fans piled 
on top of him.
Hayashi, speaking Sunday on the 
subject for the first time, said that 
Ste the fans around him who 
jumped up to catch the ball began 
to fall, he saw the ball lying on the 
floor of Pacific Bell Park, not in 
anyones possession.
He said he grabbed the ball, 
stood up, then was taken by securi
ty to a room where the ball was
authenticated.
Popov claims he rightfully caught 
the ball and that its his. He sued on 
October 24.
Hayashi said hes shocked by the 
suit.
Its difficult to accept that some
one wants to sue someone else for 
this situation, Hayashi said. Its 
difficult for myself and baseball 
fans to see this happen. Its very 
negative.
But Popovs lawyer, Marty 
Triano, has called San Francisco 
Superior Court Judge David 
Garcias order not to sell the ball 
and the scheduling of a hearing for 
November 13 a victory for baseball 
fans.
Hayashis lawyer Don Tamaki
disputed allegations that Hayashi 
and others assaulted Popov to get 
the ball.
Nobodys holding anybody up, 
nobodys swinging, no fistfights are 
breaking out, he said. Its not the 
assault and battery thats alleged in 
the complaint.
Hayashi said he hasnt had time 
to think about what he wants to do 
with the ball and hasnt made any 
decisions about it.
The estimated value of the ball is 
between $1 million and $2 million.

D-Backs pitching carving path to title
PLAYOFFS, from page A12 
doesnt happen too often. This the
ory especially holds when the 
series has seen two or three close, 
hard-fought games and then one 
team explodes for a big win. They 
will lose the next game, guaran
teed. The perfect example to sup
port this theory was game three in 
Cleveland. As the Indians piled on 
the runs, I literally saw game four, 
;and likely game five, slipping fur
ther and further away. Sometimes 
jit really hurts to be right.
\ Another quick note about my 
theory: The most notable exception 
came in the 99 ALDS when Boston 
piit up 20-some runs on Cleveland 
in' game four, then went on to win 
game five, as well. In this case, the 
theory was superceded by an even 
more powerful post-season law: 
Never, under any circumstances, 
throw a starter on only three days 
rest. This absolutely never works. 
(Those of you itching to point out 
,that Jamie Moyer won game five 
this year on three days rest must 
remember that the opposing pitch
ier, Chuck Finley had short rest, too, 
so it was an even mistake.)
[ God, I hate the *$@!ing Yankees. 
.There, got it out of the way and 
might be able to avoid saying it 
again. You know, I feel terrible 
about what happened on 
September 11. I have nothing but 
sympathy for the victims and their 
families. However, this does not 
mean the Yankees deserve to win
the World Series. Sweeping gener
alizations like this are the main rea
son I hate New York sports teams, 
and why I wish TV broadcasts had a 
feature like most video games 
where you can turn the commen
tary off and just get the play-byplay.
As for Oakland, it looks like my 
Team of Destiny mantle was a lit
tle too heavy for their young shoul
ders. They looked good for a little 
while, but they stopped getting the 
breaks after game two (except, and 
pardon the pun, when Jermaine 
Dye fractured his shin in game 
four). Lets now repeat the refrain 
which has given hope to every 
major league baseball fan outside 
of New York since the beginning of 
time: Well, theres always next 
year.
Im not willing to leave this series 
without saying something about 
the play that saved a dynasty. If 
you dont know which one Im talk
ing about, you havent watched a 
sports-related event in the past two 
weeks. In fact, Im pretty sure I saw 
this replay during a break in action 
at a Penguins game a couple days 
ago.
Having seen the. play roughly a 
billion times, I feel Im qualified to 
make the following judgment: It 
wasnt that big of a deal. Jeter 
broke on the ball when he saw that 
the throw was going to miss the 
cut-off man  a smart, heads-up 
play. By the time he got to the ball,
though, it was only a couple of 
yards from Posada. The time it took 
him to scoop it up, transfer to his 
throwing hand, and make that 
backhand flip was roughly the 
same amount of time the original 
throw would have taken to get 
there.
Besides, what if Jeter had missed 
the bounce or made a wild flip on 
the run, or Giambi had done the 
right thing and slid? This is not to 
mention the fact that Giambis run 
would only have tied the game, and 
the As never really threatened to 
get another. The Yankees can afford 
to pay for their own hype, thank 
you.
After all that, the Championship 
Series were both pretty anticlimactic, werent they? The 
Diamondbacks walked all over the 
Braves and the Mariners learned 
the hard way that the regular sea
son doesnt mean squat.
One last note, though, about 
game three of the ALCS. My theory 
comes through once again. After 
losing two at home, the Mariners 
explode for 14. There was no way 
that one-run lead in game four was 
going to hold up, and, after that, 
game five was just a formality.
After watching a thoroughly 
enjoyable game one, Matt Brun feels 
the Diamondbacks line-up may have 
just enough firepower to give their 
unhittable duo of pitchers the run 
support they need. Arizona in six.

Crew teams
show up in 
Philly race
The CMU crew teams headed to 
Philadelphia last Saturday to take 
part in the Head of the Schyulkill 
race on the Schyulkill River.
This was the first race for the 
novice team. While they have 
spent a lot of time practicing, they 
had yet to experience a real race.
Both the varsity and novice 
teams took part in the nearly 2.75 
mile race, and despite the blus
tery conditions, were able to 
acquit themselves nicely.
Three of the five varsity teams 
finished in the top 15, and the 
womens 4+A team finished sixth 
out of 45 teams.

Cross country 
teams head 
to UAA race
Last Saturday, the cross country 
teams travelled to Atlanta to par
ticipate in the UAA champi
onships, hosted by Emory 
University.
Both teams faced some 
extremely tough competition, and 
only the mens team was able to 
finish higher than last place, gar
nering an overall 7th place finish.
However, there were several 
strong performances from both - 
teams during the course of the 
day.
Continuing her dominating 
performance from this season 
was junior Katie Aerni, who 
recorded a ninth place overall fin
ish in the 5k run, with a time of ~ 
18:47.19.
Aernis finish was made even -Umore impressive by the fact that 
the next Tartan finisher was firstyear student Nicole Gartner, who 
came in 44th overall.
Leading the Tartan men was 
senior Matt Dennerline, who 
came in 16th overall in the 8k run 
with a time of 26:19.39.
Not far behind Dennerline was 
junior Mike Rossi, who placed 
26th with a time of 26:39.13.
Despite the numerically unim
pressive finish, the Tartans were 
up against some intense competi- , 
tion, and still put in a strong 
showing.

WOMEN, from page A12
but our defense was solid and shut 
them down most of the game, 
said Snell. Overall, it was a great 
way to end the regular season, to 
play that well with the bad weath
er and everything.
Over midsemester break, from 
October 19-21, the women lost 
two important UAA games, at 
Emory University in Atlanta and 
New York University two days 
later. According to Kendra, the 
Tartans 1-0 loss to the Emory 
Eagles, the sixth-ranked Division
III team in the country, wa? their 
best game of the year.
Emory scored their lone goal 
nine minutes into the game, but 
the two teams were matched even
ly, and that goal was the only scor
ing that occurred. That was our 
finest performance, said Kendra. 
Despite the loss at Emory, I think
it was a confidence builder for us. Two days later, a worn-out 
Tartan team that had been in 
Atlanta two days earlier faced off
against New York University, and 
were defeated 2-1 in overtime.
We went to NYU in terrible con
dition, said Kendra. A lot of trav
eling and tough soccer. Wed like 
another chance at both teams.
The conferences losses that the 
women suffered put them out of 
contention for selection for the 
NCAA Division III tournament.
However, selections for the 
ECAC regional tournament, which 
is being held later this week, start
ing Wednesday, will be announced 
today. The Tartans hope to be one 
of the six teams chosen.
I think we have a fairly good 
chance of getting into the tourna
ment with our record of 11-4-1, 
and since we beat all of our region
al competition, said Snell.
But at the moment, the Tartans 
are relaxing  only momentarily, 
since they will have a workout 
today  and reflecting on the suc
cess of their season.
Its been wonderful, said 
Kendra. This team has such per
sonality and such drive. Its just
been wonderful to work with 
them. I really hope we get to con
tinue the season, because theyve 
worked real hard, theyve done 
everything Ive asked them to do. I 
hope they have the chance for 
post-season play, because they 
definitely deserve it.
If not, the accomplishments 
theyve made this season have 
been huge. Our records the best 
its been in many years.
The most encouraging part of 
this season, however, isnt even 
what has been accomplished, its 
what is still to come. Now at the 
end of the season, Kendra no 
longer needs to concentrate onl 
on one game at a time.
The thing is, she said, there's 
still further to go. Weve made a 
name for ourselves in the region, 
and the next step is to compete 
better in the conference.
If the team improves next season 
in the same way it did this year, 
watch for the Tartans to make 
waves in Division III.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 29, 2001AilMens soccer team headed to NCAA tournament next week
UAA, from page A10
We are still bitter about our 
two losses, but feel they have 
helped to motivate the team and 
keep us from becoming compla
cent, he said.
And they did get motivated, 
defeating some of Division Ills 
strongest teams. Among the UAA 
teams that the Tartans upset 
were the University of Rochester 
Yellowjackets, who were ranked 
13th in the nation.
The men defeated Rochester in 
overtime, 2-1, on October 7. The 
Tartans took the free ride to the 
Division III tournament instead 
of Chicago, which is ranked 22nd 
in the nation, because of its 2-1 
win over Chicago earlier this sea
son, on September 29.
Although the Tartans record 
wasnt quite as flawless as it was 
last year, (the men went 6-1 in 
the UAA) it was still enough to 
get past elite teams like 
Washington University and the 
University of Rochester.
The last UAA games this season 
were extremely pivotal in decid
ing the Tartans claim to the title. 
Before the last game of the sea
son, the Washington Bears were 
first in the conference, at 4-1-1, 
with Carnegie Mellons Tartans, 
Chicago Maroons, and Rochester 
Yellowjackets all tied for second 
with 4-2-0 records.
If the Bears had won their last 
game, against Chicago, they 
would have put the title out of 
the other teams reaches. But the 
Chicago Maroons won the 
matchup, giving them a 5-2-0 
conference record and at least a 
share of the title.
The other teams still in con
tention were the Tartans and The 
Yellowjackets. The Tartans 
defeated Case Western Reserve, 
giving them the shared title with 
Chicago.
The Rochester Yellowjackets 
would have shared the title with 
Carnegie Mellon and Chicago, 
but somehow lost to the seventhplace Brandeis Judges and fell to
4-3-0 in the UAA.
One of the more impressive 
aspects of the teams perfor
mance this year is the fact that it 
performed and produced, all the 
while shouldering the pressure of 
being the conferences defending 
champion.
Last year we came out of 
nowhere to win the conference, 
said Dougherty. This year teams 
knew to expect us, so there was 
some added pressure each time 
we stepped on the field.
The Tartans lost last year in 
their first game in last years 
tournament, to eventual champi
on Messiah College.
Theres no doubt the Tartans 
want to try to advance when they 
take the field next week, but 
Dougherty has already gotten 
everything that hes wanted.
Everyone works hard and con
tributes, said Dougherty. I real
ly cant ask for more from my last 
season on the team.
Tartans come back in second half to defeat Yellowjackets
COMEBACK, from page A12
On the first play of Rochesters 
next drive, QB Fitzsimmons fum
bled the handoff to Breedy, and 
Frank Adam came up with the fum
ble underneath a pile in the end 
zone.
Suddenly, less than eight min
utes into the third quarter the 
Tartans were within three points, 
20-17, and the momentum 
belonged completely to CMU. By 
the end of the third quarter, the 
Tartans led the game 24-20 on a 
Adam Urbanczyk touchdown run.
We made adjustments on both 
sides of the ball, said Lackner. We 
didnt play a very good football 
game, but in the second half we 
came up with the big plays. We got 
turnovers, good field position, and 
continued to run the ball well all 
game.
Young, experienced swimmers show 
up in first two meets of new season
SWIM, from page A12 
teammates.
Some freshmen have already 
distinguished themselves, said 
Belowich.
In the first meet alone, three dif
ferent first-years from each team 
won races, and some won multiple 
times. For the men, Chris Pearson 
won the 1000 yard and the 100 
yard freestyle, Greg Kwon won the 
100 yard breaststroke, and Marty 
Koch took the 200 yard butterfly.
In addition to winning his two 
races, Pearson set school and pool 
records in the 1000 freestyle with 
his time of 9:37.53. The school 
record he broke had stood since 
1989. Also, in the Grove City meet, 
Pearson set a pool record in the 500 
yard freestyle with his time of 
4:35.85. Finally, to add icing to the 
tcake, he qualified for a B cut at 
[the NCAA tournament in the event.
\ For the women, Jennifer Wong 
won the 500 yard freestyle and 
even more impressively, took the 
1000 yard freestyle by nearly 13
seconds. Clearly the most domi
nant performance, however, was by 
Kim Rapp, who won the 50 and 100 
yard freestyle, and the 100 yard 
butterfly.
While the new performers are 
wasting no time making names for 
themselves, the returning cast from 
last year is certainly not slouching. 
In particular, sophomore Brian 
McCarthy, coming off a rookie sea
son in which he won All-American 
and Rookie of the Year honors at 
the UAA championships, has 
already raced to a quick start.
Against F&M and Rochester, 
McCarthy won two races (100, 200 
backstroke) and earned an A cut 
in the 100 backstroke. Then, 
against Grove City, he won two 
more (400 individual medley (IM), 
200 butterfly), and attained an 
NCAA B qualifying time in the 
400 IM.
The womens main problem, if 
any, last season, was the relative 
youth of the squad. This year, with 
eight returning seniors, the women 
look to use their combination of
experienced veterans and new tal
ent to make a splash.
Particularly important has been 
the leadership of senior Erin 
Andrew, who along with fellow 
seniors Sara Schultzer and 
Alexandra Schmidt, captains the 
team. Along with winning the 1000 
yard freestyle outright against 
Grove City, Andrew has been an 
invaluable source of leadership for 
the squad.
[Erins] been doing a great job 
of leading the team, said 
Belowich. Shes been working very 
hard so far.
Based on the strong contribu
tions so far from the new players 
and the veterans, the Tartan swim
mers look to make a big impact this 
season. Their next action is in the 
Rochester Relays this upcoming 
Saturday, and look for CMU to 
come out on top.
Theyre beginning to be a very 
special team, said Belowich. I 
think their work so far is a good 
portent of things to come.
A Look at the UAA
Saturdays Results:
 Wash U 21, Chicago 17
 The Washington University 
Bears clinched first place in the 
UAA for the second consecutive 
year with their win over the 
Chicago Maroons.
The Bears scored on their first 
possession, and led 21-3 at the 
half. Early in the second half, 
though, Chicago recovered a fum
ble by Wash. U running back 
Bobby Collins, and scored on the 
ensuing possession.
A Wash. U interception late in 
the game, though, would rub out 
the Maroons hopes for good.
 CWRU 43, Denison 29
 Case Western used its run
ning game to overpower Denison 
and come out with a win on 
Homecoming.
RB Brandon McDowell picked 
up 228 yards on the day, and tal
lied three TDs in the first half 
alone.

BCS football rankings not a popularity contest
120 Yards
by RJ Sikdar
Maybe this will shut up the cry
babies in Miami. Maybe it will 
silence the morons in the media. 
Maybe it will allow us to enjoy the 
rest of the regular season in college 
football without unwarranted 
shenanigans.
But whether or not the upsets at 
the top of the rankings will validate 
the Bowl Championship Series 
(BCS) as the best system this side 
of a playoff in D-I college football, 
they certainly show that this game 
is still a very volatile and unpre
dictable one.
On Monday, October 22, the BCS 
rankings were released for the first 
time, and outrage was the norm. 
Why? The rankings anointed 
Oklahoma the best team in the 
'country rather than the Associated 
presss choice of Miami.
; But based on the fact that 
Miamis record was achieved main
ly by bashing overmatched oppo
nents such as Troy State and 
Rutgers (they were actually outgained by Florida State in their 
only quality win), the Hurricanes 
should be happy that they were 
;even fourth in the BCS standings.
; However, writers spouted inane 
drivel denouncing the validity of 
any ranking system that did not 
have their favorite team on top.
| From Sports Illustrated.'s Ivan 
Maisels Burning Questions col

Laugh [at the BCS ratings] all 
you want. I have spent four years 
trying to understand the logic of 
employing these computer rank
ings assembled by well-meaning 
fans who wouldnt know a spread 
offense from a spreadsheet.... 
Having to explain ... rankings that 
have Washington State third and 
Miami eighth, or Michigan fourth 
and Miami 13th, is silly.

From USA Todays Christine 
Brennans Keeping Score column 
on October 19:
As things stand today, based on 
BCS ranking projections, the best 
team in college football would not 
qualify for the BCS so-called 
national championship game 
January 3 in the Rose Bowl.
There are few things more dan
gerous than an idiot with a pen, 
and clearly we have a lot of those in 
the media these days. Their main 
target is the computer rankings, 
because the computer programs 
eliminate biases that are present in 
every sportswriter in this country. 
Thus, the consensus top team in the 
nation at the time, Oklahoma, 
earned that spot by playing the best 
ball in the country.
BCS pollster Richard Billingsley 
writes at ESPN.com: Now, a team 
must EARN their position every 
week. Unfortunately, the ... polls 
do not force a team to earn any
thing. All you have to do is attain a 
high preseason rank, win games, 
and hope the teams above you 
lose....
The computers, on the other 
hand, are more adaptable and flex
ible, giving any team an opportuni
ty to make huge gains by simply 
performing well against quality
opposition.In other words, Miami must beat
tough teams and perform well in 
order to get to the top and stay 
there. Other teams can surpass 
them by playing better than the 
Canes. Miami can eclipse other 
teams by doing the same. What is 
so wrong with that? Well, Miami 
fans and players bawl about the 
events that took place last year.
Oklahoma ran the table and fin
ished #1 in the BCS poll. Florida 
State, Miami, and Washington fin
ished second, third, and fourth, 
respectively. Oklahoma played
(and beat) Florida State in the title 
game. But clearly, according to the 
writers, Miami deserved to play in 
the national championship game 
between #1 and #2, because they 
had beaten Florida State!
But wait a second here. Didnt 
Washington beat Miami? Uh, yeah. 
But the media made its crusade in 
the name of Miami only. It got to 
the point that the Associated Press 
poll likely would have voted Miami 
the national champion if Florida 
State had beaten Oklahoma in the 
BCS title game.
What nerve, what gall, what 
blinding stupidity. Washington, of 
course, was left out of the conver
sation entirely, because the 
Associated Mess simply did not 
make the Huskies their priority.
This season, we are hearing from 
Miami how they got a rotten deal 
again. Tailback Clinton Portis said, 
This wouldnt be the first time [we 
were slighted for a championship 
berth].... No matter what we do, 
its not good enough. This sort of 
thinking funnels from the coaching 
staff down to the players, and that 
gives foolish journalists the meat 
they need to write a biased, emo
tional piece on the Hurricanes and 
their plight.
In addition to all of this, you had 
pundits from Alaska to Zimbabwe 
claiming that if
Nebraska/Oklahoma, UCLA, and 
Miami all go undefeated, Miami 
could be left out of the champi
onship game. Really? Well what of 
the prospect that UCLA could be 
left out? What of the prospect 
that Nebraska/Oklahoma could be 
left out? Why does the media
worry only about Miami?More importantly, why does any
one care? The fact of the matter is 
that the chance of three top teams 
all going undefeated is so low in 
football that we waste too much 
time worrying about it. At the mid
point of the season, these BCS 
rankings are just a guide as to who 
the top teams are. The BCS is 
designed to produce the top two
Running back Ricardo Clarke 
provided a huge spark for the 
Tartan offense, running for 78 of 
his 132 yards in the second half, 
including a 53 yard run that set up 
one of the Tartan scores.
Also, quarterback Eric Zimpfer 
was more involved in the running 
game, rushing for 51 yards in the 
second half and providing another 
threat the Rochester defense could 
not handle.
The defense tightened down and 
dominated in the second half, dic
tating the game. They held the 
Rochester offense to two threeand-outs, followed by three 
straight turnovers. After forcing no 
turnovers in the first half, the 
defense came up with five 
turnovers in the second half,
including four interceptions.Adam added an interception to
his fumble, safety Joseph Ciccarelli 
added 2 interceptions, and cornerback Ryan McMillen added the 
other one.
Breedy was held to only 22 yards 
rushing all of the second half, as 
the Yellowjackets just could not 
move the ball.
The win continued a trend for 
Rochester, who now has been 
outscored 89-36 in the second half 
this season. They started well with 
a good game plan, but failed to 
make adjustments at the half, and 
CMU was able to capitalize and 
come out with the comeback victo
ry.
It was good to see the boys get 
their heads back in themselves and 
come back to win the game, added 
Lackner. It showed a lot of charac
ter and perseverance.
teams in the nation at the end of 
the season.
Through the first half of the sea
son, it is hard to say that Miami is 
without question the top team in 
the nation because they have yet to 
be tested. Just because they were 
the highest in the preseason polls 
of all the top teams does not mean 
they are the best team in the 
nation. The computer rankings 
realize this. Dim-witted sportswriters do not.
Two things will help Miami. First, 
their schedule gets much tougher 
down the stretch, and based on 
that alone, they will move up in the 
BCS rankings. Second, upsets hap
pen every day in college football, 
and that was never more apparent 
than on Saturday, October 27, 
2001, when three of the top five 
BCS teams and five unbeaten teams 
lost.
Oklahoma, Virginia Tech, UCLA, 
Washington State, and Maryland 
all lost this week (to Nebraska, 
Syracuse, Stanford, Oregon, and 
Florida State respectively), mean
ing that Miami now has the inside 
track in the BCS rankings as well as 
the polls to play in the national 
championship game. Hopefully the 
crying will cease and the unneces
sary second-guessing of computer 
rankings will end.
However, dont hold your breath. 
The worthless polls have ruined 
several seasons in the past and 
were a target of media hostility, but 
they are now the medias greatest 
allies in bashing the integrity of the 
computer rankings.
A playoff really is too much to ask 
of the greedy BCS and the clueless 
NCAA, because they can come up 
with virtually any excuse to prevent 
it from happening. Thus, the bot
tom line is that the BCS is the best 
system we can have short of a play
off, and its without question better 
than a poll of idiotic sportswriters 
and apathetic coaches.

Whos Next
Grove City College (2-5, 1-3 PAC) v. Carnegie Mellon (6-1, 3-1 UAA) 
at Gesling Stadium. 1 pm. WRCT 88.3 FM.
Last meeting: 14-10 Grove City. CMU leads the all-time series 24-16-2. 
After eight Tartan victories stretching from 1989 to 1996, the 
Wolverines have captured the past two meetings.
The skinny: Entering 2001 without the NCAAs all-time leading rusherRJ. Bowers, the Wolverines had a difficult road to hoe. The Presidents 
Athletic Conference is one of the more respected eastern D-III confer
ences, home to the third-ranked Presidents of Washington and 
Jefferson and the Bethany Bison.
GCC was unable to chalk up a win versus conference foes until substi
tute fullback Steve Roberts pummeled the Bethany defense for 205 
yards on 31 carries. The GCC defense held the leagues leading rushing 
attack to a meager 64 yards on 23 rushes.
Watch for: OLB Jonathan Forbes has 54 tackles and is the team leader in 
sacks (five). SS Mike Volchko has three interceptions and is a chart top
per in tackles.
Result: Revenge is in the air after last seasons disappointment at Grove 
City. Carnegie Mellon is proving that it can battle back and win the 
close games. The Tartans average almost 190 yards a game on the 
ground. GCC allows a mere 127 a contest. The immovable object will 
crumble at the might of the irresistible force. Tartans 21, GCC 10.
Game Notes
Cardiac Kilties: For two consecutive weeks, the Tartans have faced near
ly insurmountable obstacles. Against Chicago, CMU trailed 17-10 after 
a Chi-town touchdown with 30 seconds to play. Two overtime periods 
later, the Tartans celebrated with an end-zone mosh pit. This past 
Saturday in Rochester, the Tartans were losing 20-3 at halftime only to 
prevail victorious 30-20.
Kicking calamity: Sophomore Mike Palmer has a mighty foot, a fact few 
can dispute. However, he has struggled this season. Against Chicago, 
Palmer missed two field goal attempts. Last week he had one kick 
blocked and missed another. He looks to avenge his irregularity against 
GCC. Last season Palmer sent the ball wide right on a 26 yard attempt 
on the Tartans first possession of the game.
While Palmer has struggled, first-year punter Laird Stabler has found 
solid footing. Stabler had five punts averaging 40.0 yards a boot against 
Rochester. Pittsburgh Steelers punter Josh Miller a special teams player 
with a $100 bill for each punt downed inside the five. No word yet on 
whether Stabler will start doling out large sums of cash.
Slash: Quarterback Eric Zimpfer may have completed only three of 12 
pass attempts on Saturday (53 yards, but he continued to baffle oppo
nents with his rushing attack. Zimpfer called his own number 13 times 
for 80 yards, making him the most frequent ball carrier for the Kilties.

recaps MLB 
playoffs
A View From the Bleachers
by Matt Brun
This every-other-week writing 
schedule is starting to get to me. 
Between that missed week and 
mid-semester break, I have two 
complete rounds of playoffs to 
break down in this one article. 
Worse, my World Series recap may 
not come until a week after the fact, 
but well see what happens. 
Regardless, with so much action to 
cover this week, Im going to limit 
myself to general reactions to the 
first two rounds rather than a 
game-by-game analysis.
Somehow, I managed to watch 
just about all of the games in the 
Divisional Series. I mention this 
only because its never happened 
before, and so I think the league 
may be on to something in selling 
the broadcast rights for the entire 
playoffs to one network. On the 
other hand, I still find something 
very odd about watching games on 
Fox Family. I think it was probably 
those stupid promos for the 13 
Days of Halloween programming 
which couldnt possibly be at all 
scary since its on Fox Family.
The Divisional Series themselves 
were, for the most part, highly 
entertaining. Three of the four 
series featured a 1-0 game, and all 
saw at least one shutout. The Curt 
Schilling vs. Matt Morris game in 
Arizona was quite possibly the best 
pitched game Ive ever seen. 
Schilling allowed only three hits 
and one walk in a complete game, 
and Morris could have gone the dis
tance as well if they hadnt had to 
pinch-hit for him in the eighth.
In the other NL series, lets just 
say its no surprise Larry Dierker 
stepped down as manager after this 
series. The Braves were not a good 
team  they showed that all year 
long. The Astros were a good team, 
but absolutely collapsed for no 
apparent reason. An Atlanta upset 
in five games I could have under
stood, but Houston couldnt win a 
single game. Pathetic.
I have a certain theory about how 
teams perform in the playoffs. 
Basically, it states that a team that 
wins a game in an absolute rout will 
lose the next game nine out of 10 
times. The exception is when one 
team is simply dominant and routs 
every game of the series, but that

SLEEPING GIANT
Carnegie Mellon 30, Rochester 20
by Tristan Hoffmann
Junior Staffwriter
The football game 
between the Tartans and the 
University of Rochester 
Yellowjackets was a tale of 
two halves, and the Tartans 
came out with the better 
half and a 30-20 victory at 
Edwin Fauver Stadium.
Rochester began the game 
with a surprise onside kick 
recovery, stunning the 
Tartans, and the defense 
played stunned too. On the 
opening drive, Rochester 
drove the ball by running 
right through the middle of 
the Tartan defense. Running 
back John Breedy capped 
the drive with a six yard 
touchdown run.
Coach Rich Lackner said 
of the opening, Bad things 
will happen during a foot
ball game, but the important 
thing is how you respond. 
We didnt respond well 
defensively, but it couldnt 
have been a better scripted 
opening for Rochester. They 
just took advantage.
CMU then had plenty of 
opportunities to respond, 
driving deep into Rochester 
territory on their next three 
drives. Having only one 
completion in the first half, 
Rochester was able to stuff 
the run and keep them out 
of the end zone. Even worse, 
the Tartans only came away 
with three points, as they 
missed a field goal and had
one blocked.Rochesters offense, on 
the other hand, continued to 
have no problem with the 
Tartan defense. John Breedy 
ran wherever he wanted 
while accumulating 134 
yards rushing and 3 rushing 
touchdowns in the first half 
alone. Pat Fitzsimmons, 
starting in place of injured 
quarterback Jeff Piscitelli, 
had no problem running the 
offense on those drives, 
completing 9 of 17 passes for 
97 yards, as Rochester conDespite the slow start, the Tartan defense completely shut down the Yellowjacket offense in the second half. They limited Rochester RB John Breedy to 22 yards
trolled the ball for 21:24 of 
the first 30 minutes.
At half time the Tartans 
found themselves down 
20-3 and still seemed
shocked by Rochesters early 
game plan and quick start. 
However, the half gave them 
time to collect themselves, 
calm down, and get back to
their game plan, and they 
executed and took control 
early in the third.
Led by the defense, who 
came up with three straight
turnovers, the Tartans were 
given great field position 
and capitalized. Running 
back Andrew Garrod ran the 
ball in for an 11 yard touch
down and pulled the Tartans 
within 10. Then came the 
play that changed the face of 
the game.

Mens soccer team wins UAA title for second straight year
Team preparing to head to NCAA 
tournament once again
Young talent propels 
swim teams to 3-0 start
by Christopher Chung
Special Projects Manager
Head Coach Nick Gaudioso and 
his Tartan mens soccer team have 
done it again.
For the second consecutive year, 
and for the second time Carnegie 
Mellons history, mens soccer has 
claimed the University Athletic 
Association championship and a 
berth in next weeks NCAA 
Division III tournament after a 
convincing"3-1 over Case Western 
Reserve this past Saturday. The
Tartans are headed back to the 
tournament, which starts on 
Wednesday, November 7, having 
finished their UAA season with a
5-2-0 record (now 12-2-0 over
all), and sharing the top spot with 
the University of Chicago 
Maroons (5-2-0 in the UAA).
Senior Tom Dougherty, the 
Tartans starting goalkeeper, said 
the teams two losses to 
Washington University (2-1 on 
September 23) and New York 
University (1-0 on October 21) 
were painful but helpful.

Sporting a new look, the CMU 
mens and womens swim teams 
have left the block in a fury, leap
ing to a 3-0 start after only two 
weeks. Indeed, so far in this young 
season, the Tartan swimmers have 
been tremendous, picking up 
right where they left off last sea
son.
Theyve been a lot of fun to 
watch, said head coach David 
Belowich. The kids have been 
working very hard and training 
very well, and its showed in the 
races so far.
In their first meet, on October 
20 at home, the Tartans faced off 
against Franklin and Marshall 
University and Rochester 
University. On the mens side, the 
opposition was never a considera
tion, as the swimmers took out 
F&M and Rochester by scores of 
151-97 and 152-98, respectively. 
Not to be outdone, the women 
beat up on their foes by scores of 
163-97 and 163-98, respectively.
Then, last Saturday, the Tartans 
travelled to Grove City for a dual 
meet. They would maintain the 
dominance they showed in their 
opener, as the men and women 
won by scores of 140-82 and 
135-107, respectively.
A large portion of these 
resounding victories can be attrib
uted to the influx of young talent 
on both teams. The men have 12 
new first-year students on the 
squad this year, and the women 
have nine new faces. However, 
despite their relative inexperi
ence, these newcomers have not 
hesitated to show that they can 
compete just as well as their older

Womens soccer finishes solid season with wins
by Christopher Chung
Special Projects Manager
Though disappointed by close 
losses in the past weeks to confer
ence opponents, the womens soc
cer team drastically improved on 
last years record, winning all of 
their non-conference games and 
completing a respectable 2-4-1 
season within the UAA, resulting in 
an overall 11-4-1 record. The 
Tartans finished this year fifth out 
of eight teams in the UAA  a sig
nificant improvement over last 
year, when they finished last 
and still have hopes to play in post
season tournament competition.
In the past week, the women 
picked up their final two wins, 3-1 
over Hiram College and 3-0 at Case 
Western Reserve, on Thursday and 
Saturday.
Saturdays game at Case was 
highlighted by snow and freezing 
weather. Players wore gloves and 
leggings under their uniforms to 
protect themselves from the cold. 
Despite the 3-0 score, the game 
was competitive, said head coach 
Heather Kendra.
Case has three very strong 
attackers on their team, but our
defense was just outstanding, all 
over the field, said Kendra. We 
had a strategy and played it to a 
T... we played very well, the 
defense was real consistent.
In the first half, junior midfielder 
Melissa McMorrow and junior for
ward Laura Franek scored, putting 
the Tartans up 2-0. Later, in the 
second half, sophomore midfielder 
Ericka Anderson sped around her 
defender in the corner, and was 
given the assist when junior mid
fielder Susan Pevovar capitalized 
on Andersons cross, giving the 
Tartans a 3-0 lead.
It was pretty even chances yes
terday, said Kendra. Theyre not a 
slouch team. They definitely have 
some good players. We were just 
better.
Kendra noted that junior Maya 
Nigrosh and first-year Megan 
Monroe made important saves in 
the goal, and that kept the score as 
lopsided as it was. Senior back and 
captain Katie Snell agreed, and 
said that Nigrosh made a lot of 
important saves in goal, and 
[Monroe] came in with about 16 
minutes left in the game and also 
did a fantastic job.
Case had some good offense,

School of Drama students, professor kick 
off new season with Time and the Conways
by Tiffany Lee
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon University School of 
Drama opened its season in the Philip Chosky 
Theater with J.B. Priestleys play Time and the 
Conways. The play which ran October 18-20 
and October 24-27, was directed by award-win
ning director and School of Drama faculty 
member, Peter Frisch.
The School of Drama members did a wonder
ful job of portraying Priestleys play in its best 
light. Time and the Conways is about the 
Conway family offspring and the illustrious 
futures they have awaiting them. Hazel
(Sharon Ann Farrell), Carol (Phebe Taylor), 
Alan (Chris Cardenas), Madge (Eve Reinhardt), 
Robin (David Larsen), and Kay (Jaime St. 
Peter), all seem to have the best of prospects, as 
they celebrate Kays 21st birthday in 1919. 
During the party, the play flashes forward to 
Kays 40th birthday (1938), and you are faced 
with the reality of what the future will bring. 
The once-promising family has squandered its 
money away, and the promising futures have 
become bleak presents. The play then reverts 
back to the actual present, and as the night 
withers away, forecasts about the future are 
made. These are forecasts that the audience 
knows to be false, but which the characters look 
forward to with hope.
The other characters of the play, Mrs. 
Conway (Lara Casey), Joan Helford (Damali 
Anika Bobb), Gerald Thorton (Zac Hailey), 
Ernest Beavers (Yusuf Gatewood), Maid 1 
(Claudia Duran), and Maid 2 (Erin Joslyn), 
were also portrayed brilliantly. The script of the 
play was written so that the melodramatic 
moments, if acted out poorly, could have 
emphasized the artificiality of the situation. 
However, the superb acting of the entire cast 
transformed the potential melodramatic 
moments into moments of intense truth and 
discovery. Each actor brought his or her charac
ter to life, whether it be a comical character or a 
dull character. All in all, the cast is to be highlySee CONWAYS, B3
Leagues benefit raises money for Red Cross
by Beth Powell
Arts & Living Editor
The best jazz club in Pittsburgh, 
according to City Paper, featured a 
group of CMUs own senior musical 
theater majors as they performed 
An Evening of Cole Porter last Friday 
night. The James Street 
Restaurant, at 422 Foreland Street, 
located in the North Side, was 
packed. According to senior musi
cal theater major Telly Leung, the 
restaurant was completely sold 
out on reservations alone - and 
people were standing at the bar to 
watch the show. With such a great
turn out, about $900 was raised at 
this Leagues benefit, part of which 
will be donated to the Red Cross.
The show itself was fantastic. 
Jackie Baker, Leo Evans, Mitch 
Jarvis, Telly Leung, and Molly 
Sorohan combined their excellent 
vocal abilities and other talents to 
perform an entertaining collection 
of Cole Porter songs. They started 
with Another Openin, Another 
Show from Kiss Me Kate. Other 
numbers included Night and Day 
performed by Jarvis, I Get a Kick 
performed by Evans, Every Time 
We Say Goodbye performed by

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 29, 2001
David Macaulay speaks of experiences, 
inspirations, and learnings as a writer
by Nina Durai
Staffwriter
Saturday morning, October 27, 
author David Macaulay spoke in 
Carnegie Librarys lecture hall. 
Macaulay is originally from 
Lancashire, England and graduated as 
an architecture student from the 
Rhode Island School of Design in 1969. 
He has written, researched, and illus
trated over 20 books during his rather 
prolific career. In addition, his latest 
book, Building Big, (an exploration of 
the construction of large mechanical 
and architectural structures), was 
made into a five part PBS television 
series. Literary critics have deemed 
The Way Things Work as his most ambi
tious book; it is an explanation of tech
nological objects ranging from can 
openers to microcomputers. His books 
have sold over two million copies in the 
United States in addition to being 
translated into a dozen other lan
guages.
Macaulay lives the way most stu
dents would like to. He receives 
research grants to travel to romantic 
locations such as Rome and Rio de 
Janeiro to draw sketches for his 
books. As an example, for his book 
Ship, Macaulay took up scuba diving 
near the paradisiacal coasts of vari
ous Latin American countries. For 
his book Rome Antics, Macaulay 
spent his days sketching the most 
impressive structures in Rome into a 
simple storybook about a homing 
pigeon.
As a speaker, he entertained the 
audience of both adults and children 
with his humorous anecdotes. He 
gave a presentation of several illustra
tions of both books he published and 
books that he wasnt satisfied with. 
Macauley explained the process of 
creating illustrated books as well as 
the process of rejecting unsatisfactory 
products.
Macaulay is a man whos not afraid 
to stand up for his beliefs. When asked 
if he planned to write a book commem
orating the architectural splendor of 
the twin towers, he boldly stated that 
he disapproved of the lack of aestheticism of the towers. Also, an opinion 
that may be relevant to some of 
Carnegie Mellons art students is that 
Macaulay proudly denied using com
puters to assist him with his drawings. 
He believes that students have only a 
few years in art schools to learn how to 
think and they should not fall into the 
trap of thinking they are thinking 
when they are really just relying on a 
computer. He feels that he is lucky in 
that he does not have to rely on com
puter graphics to capture a visual 
scene.
Macaulay is an inspirational per
son, because he has been very suc
cessful in doing his dream job. An 
audience member asked him if he 
would ever consider another career 
for the future and Macaulay respond
ed that he would not, in a tone of 
voice that suggested genuine puzzle
ment at how the question could even 
be asked.
An Evening of Cole Porter pleases 
crowd at fundraising performance
JAZZ, from page B1
particularly fun part of the show was Baker 
singing I Hate Men after she and Jarvis sang 
True Love and then Jarvis was distracted by 
another woman, Sorohan.
With the talents of these CMU students 
and a restaurant that has the best Cajun food 
in town (again, according to City Paper), the 
show was bound to be a success. Theres no 
denying that it was indeed a huge success. It 
is a great help to the Leagues organization, 
which is raising money to give the soon-to-be 
new School of Drama graduates an opportu
nity to perform in Los Angeles and New York 
for many reputable talent agents and casting 
directors. This opportunity has proven to be 
the key to success for a number of CMU 
drama alumni. Examples of these success 
stories include Tommar Wilson (BFA 99) 
who is appearing on Broadway in The Music 
Man, Joe Manganiello (BFA 00) who has 
been cast in the part of Flash Thompson for 
the upcoming feature film Spider Man, and 
Brian Shoaf (BFA 01) who appeared on 
Broadway with fellow CMU alumnus Cherry 
Jones in Bernard Shaws Major Barbara.
These stories and more are plenty of rea
sons for this years School of Drama seniors to 
work hard to raise money and, just as impor
tantly, to please the audience. An Evening of 
Cole Porter was rehearsed for weeks in the 
students free time. Another group of senior 
musical theater majors, Lara Casey, Sharon 
Farrell, Zac Hailey, Phebe Taylor, David 
Larsen, and Anika Bobb, recently seen onstage 
in Time and the Conways, is already scheduled 
to perform An Evening of Andrew Lloyd Webber 
on November 30. If its anything like the first, 
and it should be, youll want to be there. The 
show starts at 9 pm, reservations are recom
mended, and theres an $8 cover charge. For 
more information, call the restaurant at 
(412)323-2222.
Also, for another look at the group that per
formed this past Friday, dont miss the upcom
ing Red Noses in the Philip Chosky Theater. The 
Leagues benefit performance is on Tuesday, 
December 4. Tickets will be $6 for this. Contact 
the box office for more info. Also watch for 
more Leagues performances, as the talent of 
CMUs own is almost always guaranteed to pro
vide an enjoyable evening.
Carnegie Almanac
50 years ago, October 30, 1951  The annual Community Chest 
drive began this week with student-faculty fundraising goal of $7000. 
This drive combined a variety of individual community service drives into 
one. The Community Chest represented 92 individual charitable organi
zations that served Allegheny County.
Only 62 percent of the freshmen class succeeded in passing the CIT tra
dition exams given before Homecoming. Out of the 538 eligible to the 
take the test, 333 passed, 42 failed and 163 did not show up at all.
The traditions exam was given by the sophomore class every year that 
teach the incoming freshman class about Carnegie traditions. The admin
istration, which could enforce the exam, took the attitude that student 
enforcement is enough. School spirit was a hot topic and everyone had 
issues with it. The exam was another way to help it along.
25 years ago, October 26,1976  Democratic Congresswoman Bella 
Abzug from New York addressed a large gathering of students in Skibo 
Ballroom on Monday, October 18. The focus of the talk was to encourage 
young people to exercise their right to vote. She felt that universal suf
frage is a right which has taken one revolution, a civil war, and numerous 
civil rights movements to establish. She spoke about the one of the ironies 
in the President Ford administration, where he promised to maintain an 
honest government; there are many examples of illegal American intelli
gence activities and CLA plots.
The Carnegie Mellon Music Department expanded its graduate curricu
lum of opera to include a season of four productions. Guest stage direc
tors came from the Pittsburgh Opera Company and New York City opera 
companies. These guest lecturers will conduct classes to enhance the 
quality of opera for the city of Pittsburgh.
10 years ago, October 28,1991  Pete Shell, a research programmer
in the School of Computer Science, alleged that Carnegie Mellon scien
tists engaged in research for the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA). He purported that they were focusing on how the uni
versity could make research more directly helpful for the military. This 
would include areas such as: bomb damage assessment, fully automated 
bombing, unmanned guided vehicles, automatic target tracking and 
autonomous helicopters.
Parking rates are planned to increase on an average of 17 percent for on 
campus spots. Due to a delay of federal funds and internal restructuring 
of Carnegie Mellons accounting, President Robert Mehrabian announced 
the increase to the campus community.
5 years ago, October 28, 1996  Computing Services launched 
Network 2000, a new initiative, to enhance the campus computing net
work in order to bring higher bandwidth services to every building on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus. This would enable users to transfer data from 
the existing switched 10-megabyte per second network to a 100 megabyte 
per second network. They were working with Cisco Systems.
Director of Operations Charles Bartel explained that this initiative was 
used as an example for peer universities across the country. They were 
also investigating nascent technologies such as Gigabit and ATM for the 
new upgrades.
A new course called Alternative Health was offered for the first time for 
students, faculty and staff. Through the Physical Education Department, 
this course was taught by fifth year scholar Denise Soultanian. She 
focused on alternative health methodologies and philosophies and specif
ically Eastern health practices.
1 year ago, October 30, 2000  Democratic presidential candidate 
A1 Gore came to campus on October 27. He spoke to a crowd of approx
imately 15,000 on the mall in front of Hamerschlag Hall. A variety of 
Pennsylvania government figureheads came to introduce him such as 
US Senate candidate Ron Klink, City of Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, 
several city councilmen as well as Carnegie Mellon Student Body 
President Erin Fitzgerald, and Activities Board Political Chair Tanya 
Tarr. While Gore was speaking, there were few dissenters present in the 
crowd  Green party supporters passed out flyers and urged attendees 
to vote for Ralph Nader. Gore used the topic of the Information Age 
that will lead to reforms in education. Key aspects of his plan included 
reductions of classroom size, new teachers, and modernization of the 
nations schools.
Republican presidential candidate George Bush made an appearance 
with fellow Republicans Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge and retired 
General Colin Powell at University of Pittsburghs Soldiers and Sailors 
Memorial on October 26. Bush spoke about increasing independent 
wealth and criticized Gores character and policies.
Jerry Springer, host of the notorious Jerry Springer Show, spoke in 
McConomy auditorium on the afternoon of the October 26. His lecture 
focused on politics, the media, and free speech. Springer talked about 
why news reporting is a far more destructive and exploitative force than 
his popular show could ever be. He explained that the primary difference 
between the two is that people dont have a choice if they want to be on 
the news, but on his show  they do.

Superb acting in Time and the Conways turns potential 
melodramatic moments into intense truth and discovery
CONWAYS, from page B1 
commended for a job well done.
The acting talent was not the only 
talent seen onstage. The beautiful 
scenic design, done by Lauren 
Alvarez, made the stage seem as if it
were entirely transformed to anoth
er era. The set drew the audience 
back in time, making it seem as if we 
were a part of the past. Accessories 
were planned out to the tee, and 
everything gave the impression that
you were in an actual sitting room of 
the early 1900s. During the second 
act, when the play was flashed for
ward to the future, the same set was 
transformed into an austere room 
that reflected the dreary lives of 
what were once the promising 
Conways. Everything down to the 
last detail was always planned to 
perfection.
The costume designs, which 
were done by Jade Winters, also 
deserve recognition. They were his
torically accurate and added to the 
vitality of the drama. All of the cos
tumes appeared to be genuine arti
cles of the past and added an aura 
of authenticity to the production.
Time and the Conways was a firstrate drama that emphasized what 
the collaboration of CMU students 
and faculty can produce. Dont miss 
the upcoming Red Noses in the Philip 
Chosky Theater as well as Surgeons 
of Honor and Forget Herostratus in 
the Rauh Studio Theatre. Contact the

Frisch, who received his MFA in 
Stage Direction from Carnegie

numerous professional accolades, 
Frisch has also held faculty posts at 
Boston University, Cal Arts,

Disney World Orlando fires 100 actors who perform in live shows
FLORIDA (AP)  Disney World 
Orlando has fired about 100 full
time actors who perform in the 
theme parks live shows.
The Walt Disney Company 
announced the layoffs last week, 
effective immediately. The compa
ny said the firings come because of 
a decline in tourism which fol
lowed the September 11 terrorist 
attacks in New York and 
Washington, D.C.
The shows include Festival of the 
Lion King, The Hunchback of 
Notre Dame, Hoop-De-Doo 
Revue and the Indiana Jones Epic
Stunt Theatre at the parks various 
sites. The actors have been working 
under a four-year collective bargain
ing contract which Equity and 
Disney agreed to in the fall of 2000. 
Under the pact, laid-off performers 
receive no less than two weeks con
tractual salary, plus unused vacation 
and sick pay, according to Equity.
Additional severance pay goes to 
some performers, depending on 
length of employment, Equity said. 
According to the contract, the two 
weeks salary will go to performers 
with 3-5 years continuous service, 
three weeks pay for 6-9 years, and
four weeks for 10 or more years. 
The pact also requires that actors 
receive an appropriate notice peri
od. Since the layoffs became imme
diately effective without the nor
mal two weeks notice, the actors 
were paid the salaries that would 
cover the two-week period, accord
ing to Zalina Hoosein, an Equity 
business representative who spoke 
to Back Stage on Monday 
Equity is dismayed by the large 
number of performers affected by 
this lay-off, said Carol Waaser, 
Equitys Eastern regional director. 
Were just glad that our collective
bargaining agreement provides for 
severance payments in this unfor
tunate situation. The Equity office 
in Orlando is working with individ
ual performers to ensure they 
receive all the benefits to which 
theyre entitled.
According to the Associated 
Press, Disney spokesman Bill 
Warren said that workers affected 
by the cuts have been offered other 
non-entertainment jobs. Those 
who dont accept the offer will 
receive severance packages.
At press time, AP reported that 
Disney World had asked other of its
Orlando employees to voluntarily 
cut back 20 percent of their hours 
and salaries. Disney spokeswoman 
Marilyn Walters said Disney has 
encouraged 7,400 full-time work
ers to reduce their workweek to 32 
hours in order to help preserve 
some jobs and benefits. The compa
ny also released an unspecified 
number of its highly paid high-tech 
employees on Monday. Work 
schedules for 40,000 of Disneys 
hourly employees were reduced fol
lowing the immediate downturn in 
tourism following the Sept. 11 
attacks, AP said.

Pittsburgh Job Prospects: 
Not Great, but Still There
by Shilpa Desai
Two CMU professors write new book exploring the 
key factors associated with successful innovation
Creating Breakthrough Products, written by CMU professors Jonathan Cagan 
and Craig Vogel, was presented to the press in an event held last Thursday.
by Chirag Nangia
Junior Staffwriter
Most products fail. Some suc
ceed. A few redefine their markets 
or even create entirely new mar
kets, reads the inner cover of 
Creating Breakthrough Products: 
Innovation from Product Planning to 
Program Approval, a new book by 
Carnegie Mellon professors 
Jonathan Cagan and Craig M. 
Vogel. The book is about what it 
takes to create those breakthrough 
products and services. Drawing 
upon nearly a decade of advanced 
research, Professors Cagan and 
Vogel identify the key factors asso
ciated with successful innovation 
 and offer a revolutionary 
approach to building tomorrows 
great products. Some might argue 
that in a slow economy, the time' to 
innovate isnt now. In fact, many 
companies have taken this idea to 
heart by drastically reducing their 
research and development initia
tives and riding the slow economy 
based on their existing products 
and services. However, professors 
Cagan and Vogel, along with many 
product development experts, 
argue that the down economy is the 
time to innovate. Sharp, well-engineered products, regardless of mar
ket conditions, could probably sell 
very well, even in slower 
economies, or even provide the 
thrust for a slower economy to rise 
back up into a strong economy.
One thing to be noticed about the 
authors is the varying fields they 
come from. Cagan is a professor of 
mechanical engineering at CMU. 
His work focuses on the early stages 
of product development with 
emphasis on engineering design, 
interdisciplinary collaborations,
formal design synthesis, and com
putational design tools. Professor 
Vogel, on the other hand, is a pro
fessor in the School of Design. His 
areas of expertise include product 
design, product aesthetics, design 
history, team management, and 
design patent litigation. One might 
wonder what a School of Design 
professor doing writing a book with 
a CIT professor. However, it may be 
noted that the best innovation 
comes at the intersection of disci
plines: in this case, design and 
engineering.
At an event held last Thursday in 
Roberts Engineering Hall, the book 
was formally presented to the 
press. The event included presen
tations from the professors and 
product displays from companies. 
Displays ranged from H.J. Heinzs 
new colored ketchup to high tech 
walkie-talkies and a no-mess, no
fuss carpet cleaner. Also 
announced at the event was the 
creation of the Consortium of New 
Product Development, a Carnegie 
Mellon-lead initiative, featuring 
significant corporations from many 
industries including Ford Motor 
Company and Motorola. The con
sortium will focus on developing 
methods and tools to help further 
new product development and sup
ports the new book by members 
Cagan and Vogel with much praise. 
The book is not about hype, not 
about fluff, but about what 
counts, noted Mark Dziersk, Vice 
President of Design at Herbst Lazar 
Bell, a turnkey product develop
ment consulting firm.
It is important to look at key 
products which have done remark
ably well, and look at how they 
have succeeded. A normal pioneer 
of new technologies is Apple 
Computer, and their latest product,
iPod (a portable audio device), is a 
great example of innovation 
through the intersection of design 
and engineering. The product, 
described as a work of art, is about 
the size of a deck of playing cards, 
but it has a capacity of over a thou
sand songs. For Cagan and Vogel, it 
is products like the iPod, with a
combination of good design and 
solid engineering, break the tradi
tional barriers and help not only 
the company who creates them but 
moreover, help jumpstart a slug
gish economy. As one member of 
the consortium put it, This is the 
time to innovate ... there can be no 
better time.
Business Briefs
US will offer 
insurance aid
The Bush administration and 
key lawmakers have drawn up the 
outlines of a government aid 
package that would help the 
insurance industry withstand 
future terrorist attacks. They hope 
to introduce legislation next 
week.
Under the proposal, the indus
try would finance the first $10 
billion in payments following a 
future attack, and the govern
ment would pay 70% to 90% of 
costs after that, an administra
tion official said Saturday. The 
exact percentage remains to be 
decided.
The agreement came after a 
meeting Friday with Treasury 
Secretary Paul ONeill and Sen. 
Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., the 
Banking Committees chairman; 
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, 
the committees senior 
Republican; and Chris Dodd, DConn., also a member of the 
committee, the official said.
The money would come from 
general revenues, said Treasury 
Department spokeswoman 
Michele Davis. Some lawmakers 
and consumer groups have ques
tioned whether taxpayers should 
pay to keep the insurance indus
try healthy, but Davis defended
the proposal.
The administration believes the 
proposal is vital to the health of 
the economy.
Major reinsurance companies, 
which assume part of the risk cov
ered by insurance firms, have said 
they wont renew terrorism cover
age after Dec. 31, when many con
tracts expire. US insurance com
panies that write property policies 
could face payouts of $30 billion 
to $50 billion for the attacks on 
the World Trade Center and the 
Pentagon.
The measure would take effect 
next year and likely expire after 
three years at most.
Legislation on the proposal 
could be introduced as early as 
next week.
CEO of United 
Airlines quits
United Airlines chief executive 
James Goodwin resigned Sunday, 
saying it was time for a new 
leader to guide the organization, 
which has struggled greatly since 
the September 11 attacks.
Goodwins resignation came 
two weeks ago after a letter he 
wrote to employees was made 
public. In it, he predicted the trou
bled airline could perish unless its 
fortunes were reversed.
Two unions representing
United employees called for 
Goodwins resignation and the 
companys stock fell more than 
20% last week in the fallout from 
the letter.
Union leaders accused 
Goodwin of panicking customers 
and workers unjustifiably. They 
claimed his remarks were made to 
get contracted employees to agree 
to lower wages, gain negotiating 
leverage or get more government 
assistance.
In a statement released Sunday, 
Goodwin said he was proud to 
have contributed to the tremen
dous growth of United during my 
34 years ... United is a great com
pany and it is the right time for a 
new leader to guide the organiza
tion through the challenges that 
lie ahead.
United already was in deep 
trouble before the terrorist 
attacks, suffering severely from 
the downturn in business travel, 
which it depends on more heavily 
than other airlines. Adding to its 
woes were the highest costs of any 
major US carrier, including steep 
labor expenses.
The airline has laid off about
20,000 of its 100,000 employees 
since the attacks caused a drop
off in air travel. It also is trimming 
its daily schedule to 1,654 flights 
as of October 31, down about 30% 
since the attacks.

After the relatively lukewarm 
showing of companies at both the 
BOC and TOC, its hard not to 
admit that the job market has 
changed. The Pittsburgh job mar
ket has definitely slowed down, 
much like the job markets around 
the US. That warm feeling of hav
ing companies vie over you has 
also turned cold  however, all 
hope is definitely not lost, and if 
we look closer at what is available 
right here in Pittsburgh, we will 
see that sunshine still exists,
Mellon students who they could 
never get a hold of before. In 
short, Carnegie Mellon students 
are becoming more available to 
Pittsburgh employers, and this is a 
benefit for both the employers, 
and the graduates who are willing 
to stay here. And this isnt true for 
just one major  this is true for all 
students.
An important thing to note 
however, is that even though it 
may seem that the stock market 
has messed everything up when
except it is covered by a few 
clouds, and we have to look more 
closely to find it. Judith Mancuso, 
Associate Director of Carnegie 
Mellons Career Center, is looking 
at this hidden sunshine, and prov
ing that the job market is still 
booming, especially in specific 
sectors such as biotechnology. 
However, the key factor to 
observe when looking at the 
Pittsburgh job market is that 
graduates just dont want to stay 
here. Pittsburgh has a difficult 
time attracting and keeping grad
uates, and especially the Carnegie 
Mellon ones. Although low 
salaries prove to be the key reason 
that graduates dont stay in the 
Pittsbugh area, says Mancuso, 
Pittsbugh employers, have long 
wanted to get a hold on the 
Carnegie Mellon graduate ... so I 
see this as a perfect opportunity if 
students are looking to find 
employment in Pittsburgh. In 
fact, Mancuso goes on to say, the 
market for the Carnegie Mellon 
student is actually much better 
than it is for other students in the 
area.
A very exciting bit that Mancuso 
hinted is that because the job mar
ket has slowed and big companies 
from New York, Austin, Boston, 
etc. arent as eager to recruit as 
before, Pittsburgh employers 
would jump at the Carnegie
Erica DiBenedetto/Art Editor
youre trying to get a. good job, 
the big employers havent com
pletely stopped recruiting  they 
are just delaying the process. 
Even at the opportunity confer
ences, they were trying to recruit 
for the future, such as the second 
market quarter of this year. And a 
very important thing to remem
ber as Mancuso pointed out, is 
that the companies have proba
bly cut down on the number of 
schools they are visiting, but 
Carnegie Mellon is still very 
much one of their top picks, and 
the bottom line is that they are 
still coming here. And this fact 
should be very encouraging to 
graduates.
So the job market may seem 
gloomy, but it really isnt all that 
bad, even in Pittsburgh. The 
future is too hard to predict, and 
so foreseeing the job market is 
too tricky. However, new oppor
tunities keep rising, and for 
example, with the crisis experi
enced on September 11, new 
branches, committees, groups 
and projects have been initiated, 
and in turn these have opened 
up a whole new world in terms of 
job opportunities. And looking at 
Pittsburgh, one can see that 
there is a whole sector of tech
nology that has been 
untapped  the key is just

Report shows Pittsburghs tech sector continues its 
rapid expansion, becoming key driver of economy
by Gautam Jain
Junior Staffwriter
New reports have confirmed 
the significant role played by the 
regions technology sector in the 
success of southwestern 
Pennsylvanias fiscal activity. This 
report emerges from the roots of 
the Pittsburgh Technology 
Councils Tech 50 event that hon
ored the greater Pittsburghs 50 
fastest growing technology com
panies.
The State of the Industry Report, 
the third in its series, was issued by 
the Pittsburgh Technology Council 
after being compiled by CMUs 
Center for Economic Development.
The report draws attention to the 
economic and the social influence 
shaped by the key technology sec
tors like environmental technology, 
advanced materials and manufac
turing, biotechnology and informa
tion technology. In addition, the 
report features comprehensive 
information about the regions ven
ture capitals, initial public offer
ings, business incorporations, and 
the research and development 
activities.
According to the report, the 
software establishments in the six 
counties of southern Pennsylvania 
region increased to 939 (about 
128%) during the last decade. 
The number of employees working 
in these firms also went up by
about 133% to 14,268. The 
biotechnology cluster grew by 
almost 27% during the same peri
od, and the average wage for this 
cluster increased by a staggering 
80% to nearly 55,000 a year. The 
Pennsylvania Department of 
Labor and Industry says that 
many component industries in this 
cluster are expected to grow in 
employment to about 15,000 by 
the year 2008. Along with the 
improvements in the industrial 
sectors, the research and develop
ment has also received an impetus 
among the universities of this 
region. During 1998, CMU ranked 
66 while Pitt ranked 38 in R&D 
spending among all the 547 US 
universities receiving aid from the
National Science Foundation. At 
about the same period, the 
Software Engineering Institute 
ranked 15th among the 18 
Federally Funded Research and 
Development Centers (FFRDC) in 
the US.
The report also showcases the 
efforts of the Pittsburgh 
Technology Council and the 
Pennsylvania Economic League to 
improve the structure and level of 
the business taxes in Pennsylvania. 
A 5% expansion of the Job Creation 
Tax Credit Program and a reduc
tion in the inheritance tax from 6 % 
to 4.5% are some of the reforms 
introduced by them. Due of these 
activities, it has become possible

REPORT, from page B5 
for Pennsylvania to come within 
top ten of Site Selection magazines 
annual survey of states with the 
highest number of new business 
expansion projects. Also to further 
indicate their success, 
Pennsylvania saw more than
109,000 jobs created in 2000, the 
largest increase in over 12 years.
The past decade has been one 
of significant transformation of 
our region and our economic 
base, said Steven G. Zylstra, 
president and CEO of the 
Pittsburgh Technology Council. 
Unlike other regions of the 
country, our technology sector 
was not created on the back of 
the dot.com boom. The State of 
the Industry Report highlights 
the dynamism and diversity of 
southwestern Pennsylvanias 
technology sector, leaving no 
doubt that we will continue our 
evolution into one of the nations 
premier technology hubs.
The State of the Industry Report 
measures the six-county 
Metropolitan Statistical Area 
(MSA) that encompasses 
Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, 
Washington, and Westmoreland 
counties. The report also includes 
separate data for the entire 13- 
county southwestern Pennsylvania 
region which is comprised of
Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, 
Bedford, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, 
Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, 
Somerset, Westmoreland, and 
Washington counties.
The report also says that the 
Pittsburgh region has trans
formed itself from an economy 
based on traditional and manu
facturing oriented employers, pri
marily in steel and other material 
industries, to one based on a 
diversified mix of technology, ser
vices, and advanced manufactur
ing businesses. Thanks to the 
developments in the technologi
cal sector of this region, 
Pennsylvania has redefined its 
industrial potential and its techni
cal strength to the world.
Copies of the State of the 
Industry Report are available 
through the Pittsburgh 
Technology Council website,

The Pittsburgh Technology 
Council is one of the largest 
regional technology trade associ
ations in the United States with 
more than 1,800 member compa
nies within its geographic territo
ry of 13 counties in southwestern

it combines the qualities of a big

Pittsburgh has over eighty commu

down and call Pittsburgh home. 
And in terms of graduates leaving

bitterness leads you to start giving out last

with a time-honored Halloween tradition: the 
horror flick. Were not talking about your runof-the-mill scary movies like Carrie or the

I remember I was eating breakfast one day and I wondered 
what it would be like to be a Cuban poet. The Capn Crunch 
was going down hard that day and I wished for some Lucky 
Charms. Then Tony the Tiger came in, and told me that Cuban 
poetry is GRRRREEEAT. He recited a few lines, and mentioned 
that I should see the movie Before Night Falls.. Its all about a 
Cuban poet. I saw it, and Ive never been the same since. My 
Lucky Charms are luckier, and my Capn Crunch is crunchier. 
Fortunately, I saw the movie before night fell, because the sun
set after the movie was the sunsettiest sunset Ive ever seen.
My mission to find the perfect Cuban poetry started. I walked 
due south, off of Key West, then swam down to Cuba. I beat off 
the sharks with my anti-shark laser beam, and washed ashore. I 
first looked to the sand on the beach for poetry, but there was 
none to be found. I came upon a cigar factory next, and still none. 
Then I wandered and wandered, and came to Fidel Castros man
sion. I had finally found some Cuban poetry! It said:
Do not enter 
Do not come here

So go away in fear.

I indeed went away in fear. I walked back to the shore, away from 
Havanna, got to the beach, and swam away. I did not know where 
I was swimming to; I figured Id adapt when I got there. I reached 
this island, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, where there were 
computer animated beings and creatures all over the place. These 
things thought they were great works of art, but they were phony 
beings created by a lifeless and mindless machine. I wished to leave 
the island and never see these pretentious beings again.
I realized I had a magnet. Not a regular magnet, but a super 
magnet. I decided to go underground and destroy it. There 
was a trap door on the beach, and I went down. The stairs were 
long and dark; I slipped numerous times. I finally got to the 
core, the hard drive that was controlling the island. The Intel 
sign hung over my head, and I knew I was in enemy territory. 
In one quick movement, I took the sign down, and threw the 
magnet on the hard drive. All of the pixelated characters dissappeared, as did the island. I was in the middle of the ocean 
again, swimming into the sunset. Hopefully that would be my 
final fantasy on this voyage.

As we prepare for October 31, 
this is a time to reflect on the 
amount of candy we are about to 
receive. And to watch gory horror 
shows. And to scare ourselves silly. 
So, in order to scare myself and the 
readers who, like my friend Yaron, 
are accustomed to seeing scary pic
tures of angry metal dudes accom
panying my reviews, I have decided 
to experiment. I am not turning my 
back on the forbidden art of Heavy 
Metal, but rather taking the chance 
to explore what people seem to like 
so much. In fact, I have taken CDs 
representing four genres (country, 
techno, rap, and dub) to learn 
about and review. I think youll like 
the results. (By the way, you can 
expect a hell of a lot of metal in the 
next few weeks and months as I 
recuperate from this sinister exper
iment!)

My arms were getting tired, so I developed a system of gills 
that would allow me to breathe as I walked the ocean floor. 
Walking was definitely nicer, although avoiding the coral reefs 
and the stingrays became annoying after a while. I walked onto 
this glass bowl and I looked down. I had discovered Atlantis! 
The entrance was near, so I went in. Atlantis was the most per
fect place ever. The city was gorgeous and seemed very effi
cient. There were all sorts of stores and commerce, and the res
idences were astonishing. However, everyone was dead.
The city of Atlantis was a giant tomb, and I was raiding it. 
Had I known, I would not have entered such sacred ground. 
But, there was someone there. Someone was there other than 
me. It was Indiana Jones! He was stealing all of the gold 
medallions from the corpses, to give to his curator, Marcus 
Brody. He claimed he was trying to stop the Nazis from getting 
them, but he wouldnt listen to me when I told him that World 
War II had been over for nearly 55 years. He encircled me with 
his whip and threw me out.

an apparent sequel to the bands hit 
Miserable from A Place in the Sun. It features 
clever wordplay with homophones, which can 
also be found in trace quantities in 
Everythings Cool and Live for This. The 
songs humor revolves around a pathetic rela
tionship that includes revelations of promiscu
ity on The Jerry Springer Show. Over My 
Head, which features back-up vocals by Steven 
Tyler of Aerosmith, also possesses the potential 
to be a single, like most songs on this radiofriendly album. When this bonus track was 
already released on the soundtrack to last 
years Titan AE, however, that potential was 
blown.
With Atomic, Lit finds themselves confronted 
by new influences and lifestyles, but doesnt 
stray far from the path that worked last time. 
Songs like Everythings Cool and Addicted 
excellently represent the essence of fun and 
catchy sing-along radio pop-rock. Hopefully, 
though, they will be released as singles before 
songs like Lipstick and Bruises and Happy in 
the Meantime steer the band in the wrong 
direction. Despite being familiar with singing 
about drugs, sex, and rock n roll, Lits members 
are perplexed about how to be rock stars. 
Atomic renews Lits spotlight for at least anoth
er 15 minutes.
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy 
Sunday, November 4
Rock star fame and success can change a 
group, but for the most part, Lit remains 
unscathed in the presence of a big following, 
wealth, and awards. The bands lyrics were 
always about drugs, sex, and rock n roll, so in 
the wake of the success of the bands break
through album A Place in the Sun, there isnt too 
much new and revolutionary for their latest 
release, Atomic. Upbeat even when singing 
about negative issues, the foursome of vocalist 
A. Jay Popoff, guitarist Jeremy Popoff, bassist 
Kevin Baldes, and drummer Allen 
Shellenberger, maintains its So-Cal and oldschool-rock influences in playing pop-rock tai
lored for radio.
There are, of course, some slight variations to 
the bands formula. After befriending pop-punk 
acts like The Offspring and Blink-182, there is 
some light-punk infused with the guitar parts, 
but the rhythm section generally does not 
speed up for the riffing. Jeremy Popoff has a 
few guitar solos here and there, such as in 
Drop D and Next Time Around, but his 
biggest claim to fame remains his goatee, the 
coolest facial hair in mainstream rock other 
than that of Static-X frontman Wayne Static.
The rock star lifestyle can still be found, but
I emerged from the Atlantic, went through the air, and found 
myself on another island. This island, a rich and green island, 
seemed to be uninhabited. I walked around and around and 
around for days, I didnt find any sign of life. One morning, my toe 
caught a stick and I fell flat onto my face. Another one of those 
sticks broke my fall. When I got up, I took a closer look at the stick, 
and I found that it wasnt a stick at all. It was a candy brain. There 
were candy brains all over the beach! There were all different fla
vors too: cherry, blueberry, strawberry, and even mango.
The brain candy was quite tasty and it wasnt long before I 
collected enough to feed me for a month. I stashed it in the hollowed-out trunk of a palm tree. One night, however, I saw little 
brain candy gnomes, and they were stealing it. They had an 
affinity for the blueberry, because I saw little blueberry tracks 
leading to their hideout. I followed, only to see that they were 
feeding a bunch of castaway kids, who were imprisoned in a 
long hallway. They quickly saw me and imprisoned me as well. 
I became just another one of the kids in the hall.

B8THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 29, 2001
Halloween, bad horror films  a perfect combination
HORROR, from page B8
horrific struggles to keep abreast of the latest 
misc.market posts. Okay, not really. Whatever the 
true plot (is there one?), The Toxic Avenger seems 
to be about a 
creature with 
Terminator-esque 
capabilities and 
Freddy Kruegers 
dashing looks.
How could you 
pass up a man 
who French fries 
his foes and dry 
cleans the das
tardly? They did
nt even have to 
mention New 
Jersey for this to 
be classified as 
horror.
4. Leprechaun 4: In Space  Upon the 
recommendation of a kid who looks like Jesus, 
we looked at the box for this one. Well, not 
really, because Heads Together doesnt have it. 
But you can find anything on 
http://www.imdb.com, so we looked at a pic
ture of the box online. Its got some pretty com
puter graphics of lighting and it actually looks 
more like a video game than a movie. The plot 
seems to revolve around Leprechaun going into 
space to marry a princess so he can become the 
ruler of the planet Dominia. If it were a video 
game, you would be responsible for saving the 
world, but since its a movie, you have to watch 
helplessly as victim after victim succumbs to 
the evil leprechaun.
5. Innocent Blood
that sad catego
ry of movies we 
actually have 
seen. It is really 
ultra-super-bad, 
but its all about 
Pittsburghs 
mobsters. 
Actually, we did
nt know we had 
any, but appar
ently they come 
out when French 
femme-fatale 
vampires dont
This one falls into
quite manage to kill the ones they try to. But 
everything turns out pretty well, since he dies 
in the end anyway, from something like hyper
speed leprosy. Apparently, thats what happens 
when gangster quasi-vampires get caught in 
the sun. Neat.
6. The Sinful Nuns of Saint Valentine 
In true debauched scary movie fashion, this 
movie pairs naughty nuns with psychological 
instability in what The Redeemer Magazine 
praised for having a demented abbess, nude 
nuns, and enough sexual blasphemy to guaran
tee a Second Coming. While hardly character
istic of many horror films grotesque rampages 
or supernatural phenomena, the mental pic
ture we had of mentally disturbed and sexcrazed sisters [who] lose their habits and their 
morals with equal gusto was enough to trau
matize us for years to come. Bonus points for 
being in Italian with subtitles.
7. Children Shouldnt Play with Dead 
Things  Your typical stupid-people-following-a-psychopath-to-an-abandoned-placemovie with a twist. This motion picture classic 
features five would-be actors willing to tag 
along after their, er, eccentric director to a deso
late island burial ground to perfect their thespian skills. This aint no Gilligans Island, folks. As 
the cover promises, the dead do rise  and 
they are hungry. Gives a whole new meaning to 
the term break a leg, doesnt it?
8. George 
Romeros Dawn 
of the Dead - If
youve seen Night 
of the Living 
Dead, Return of 
the Dead, or Day 
of the Dead, then 
you probably 
dont actually 
need to see the 
best horror film 
ever made, as 
Roger Ebert 
declared Dawn of 
the Dead. However, youll probably never get 
another chance to see ice skating zombies in our 
very own Monroeville Mall (although the director 
and the characters pretend theyre in 
Philadelphia). Heads Together has the wide 
screen US Theatrical Cut which also has some

alternate scenes from the European cut. Now 
what on earth would the European cut be? 
European zombies on ice...
9. Frankenhooker  This babys unrated, 
yo. So the premise is that a mad scientist acciden
tally runs over his fiancee with a lawn mower. 
Yes. Apparently this can happen in movies. 
Anyway, he kills her and is very upset, so he goes 
to New York City and hacks up some prostitutes 
and uses their body parts to put his lover back 
together. And oh, the tricks she turns! Frankly, 
the best part of this movie is the box  and we 
can say that legitimately, because this is another 
bad movie weve somehow seen along the way. 
The box is amaz
ing. Actually, just 
go to the video 
store and play 
with the box 
instead of rent
ing the movie.
Press the button 
and the
Frankenhooker 
herself, standing 
in the entrance 
to the subway, 
asks Wanna 
date? Hell yeah, 
we do!
10. The Sound of Music  175 minutes of 
sheer terror characterize this movie, which 
relates the story of seven demonic children and 
their governess luring innocent Austrian vil
lagers to the mountains with their spine-chilling 
vocal performances. The sinister nanny poses 
under the guise of deported nun who dreams of 
things like brown paper packages tied up with 
string. Just what exactly is in that idyllic brown 
paper package? Books on satanic rituals? 
Sacrificial goat blood? A severed head? While 
Captain Von Trapp is seduced by the governesss 
supernatural powers, we sure hope you dont get 
sucked into her web of melodic terror. Rated G 
for gruesome.
Now if youre too lazy, or just plain scared of 
monsters in the the alleys to go rent one of these 
gloriously terrible movies, you can always just 
hike on over to the dark and frightening depths 
of McConomy Auditorium. Word on the street is 
that AB has some grisly horror going on, too. 
Final Fantasy? Stay home, kids, or youll have 
bad dreams for weeks.
From Hell: Pretty faces, 
choppy editing, and notso-suspenseful plot 
HELL, from page B7 
most of us  in 1886, someone 
anonymously murdered prosti
tutes with shocking exactitude, 
meticulously removing certain 
organs, and was never caught  
but From Hell fails to expand 
upon this, resulting in a movie 
thats predictable at best. Whats 
further, pressure from the MPAA 
allegedly forced the directors to 
rework some particularly gory 
scenes in order to avoid an NC-17 
rating, and the end result is sur
prisingly little blood or graphic 
violence (during the first hour, at 
least). Instead, most of the mur
ders take place within dark and 
hazy alleys, with the sound of the 
knife slicing into the victims 
body the chilling means of con
veying the act.
The talented cast, too, is 
plagued by sometimes-inconsistent accent usage and a storyline 
too complicated to allow the 
audience sufficient time to iden
tify with the prostitutes desper
ate poverty or the killers moti
vation for stalking and attacking 
women. Johnny Depp leads the 
cast as Inspector Abberline, the 
detective assigned to solving the 
horrific crime, whose opiumhazed psychic visions do more 
for the case than the rest of 
Londons police force combined. 
Depp was aptly selected for this 
dark role, as he successfully 
draws the audience into the 
grisly hallucinations that he 
both suffers from and relies 
upon in order to solve crimes. 
Heather Graham plays Mary 
Kelly, one of the unfortunates 
(Londons PC term for whores, 
were told) whos a potential tar
get of the Ripper. Although 
Grahams acting is impressive, 
her unblemished skin and 
straight white teeth make her a 
less-than-believable character
when compared to the haggard 
women she works alongside on 
the streets.
As the least hardened of the 
girls (and therefore the least 
resistant to police interroga
tion), Mary inadvertently 
becomes Inspector Abberlines 
confidante, and for some inex
plicable reason, their relation
ship quickly turns romantic. 
Abberline and Mary proceed to 
reveal to each other their per
sonal misfortunes and hopes for 
the future, details that are never 
truly probed or even resolved. 
Additional scenes  such as of 
an asylum audience gawking at 
John Merrick, (the legendary 
Elephant Man)s physical dis
figurement, or one married cou
ples explicit sexual encounter  
are likewise inserted into From 
Hell without being truly neces
sary. Granted, towards the end 
of the movie, many loose ends 
are addressed and the surprising 
interconnectedness of multiple 
characters is established, but it 
almost seems to be too little, too 
late. The first genuinely gory 
scene comes with the revelation 
of Jack the Rippers alleged iden
tity, but even this is somewhat 
expected, and the story seems to 
fade out rather than come to a 
decisive conclusion.
Although admittedly a reflec
tion of the unsolved nature of 
the crime, such ambiguity, cou
pled with the sheer complexity 
of From Hell, makes it by and 
large too distracting to be a 
thriller. For its psychologically 
disturbing undertones and the 
sheer atrociousness of the 
Ripper case, however, From Hell 
is much more compelling and 
only in that sense truly worth all 
the hype.
FINAL GRADE: B -
K-Pax tops box office
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Aliens 
and ghosts dominated the box 
office this weekend as the mental-ward drama K-Pax, starring 
Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey as 
a possible visitor from space, took 
in $17.5 million to debut as the 
No. 1 film.
A close second was the 
Halloween horror remake 13 
Ghosts, which grossed $15.7 mil
lion, according to studio estimates 
Sunday. Last weekends top film, 
From Hell, slipped to third place 
with $6.1 million.
Another ghost tale, rapper 
Snoop Doggs Bones, had a modest 
opening of $2.95 million, debut
ing at No. 9.
On the Line, a romantic come
dy featuring Lance Bass and Joey 
Fatone of N Sync, opened weak
ly in 11th place'with $2.3 mil
lion.
Kevin Klines Life As a House, in 
which he plays a dying architect 
trying to make amends to his 
neglected family, opened well in 
limited release, grossing 
$294,000 in 29 locations for a 
strong average of $10,138 a the
ater.
The bank robbery comedy High 
Heels and Low Lifes, starring 
Minnie Driver and Mary 
McCormack, bombed in limited 
release, taking in just $149,224 at 
175 theaters for a dismal $648 
average.
Overall, box office revenues 
rose slightly. The top 12 films 
grossed $73.4 million, up 3.4 per
cent from the same weekend last 
year.
It was the last quiet weekend 
at the box office for a while. Big 
holiday-season films begin hit
ting next week with Monsters, 
Inc.,an animated tale from the 
makers of the Toy Story movies. 
The following weekend brings 
the Farrelly brothers latest com
edy, Shallow Hal, starring 
Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack 
Black.
And the years most anticipated 
movie, Harry Potter and the 
Sorcerers Stone, opens a week 
after that.
Hollywood has had a solid fall 
so far despite the terrorist 
attacks, which prompted the 
industry to shuffle its schedule 
and postpone movies with terror
ism elements. Since the 
September 11 attacks, movie rev
enues are up 6 to 7 percent from 
the same period a year ago, said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of 
Exhibitor Relations, which tracks 
the box office.
This was a strong post-Labor 
Day period considering whats 
been going on in the world, 
Dergarabedian said. It tells you 
people will respond to the movies 
out there, that they want to escape 
into a story.
In K-Pax, Spacey plays a mental 
patient claiming to be a visitor 
from a distant planet who has a 
healing effect on other inmates 
and his psychiatrist (Bridges). 
Playing in 2,541 locations, the 
film had a solid average of $6,877 
a theater and played to audiences 
largely 25 and older.
I think the fact is, its the first 
real dramatic film for adults 
released in a very long time, said 
Nikki Rocco, head of distribution 
for Universal, which produced KPax. To have adults come out in 
such magnitude shows the mar
keting really worked. Its not a film 
for teenagers.
13 Ghosts stars F. Murray 
Abraham and Tony Shalhoub in a 
visual effects-driven remake of 
William Castles haunted-house 
tale from 1960. It averaged $5,627 
in 2,781 theaters.
Fright films typically open 
well then fade fast after the core 
audience of under-25 horror 
fans have seen them. But 13 
Ghosts was produced for only 
$20 million, meaning it should 
turn a good profit, said Dan 
Fellman, head of distribution for 
Warner Bros., which released 13 
Ghosts.
Bones, playing in just 845 the
aters, had a so-so screen average 
of $3,483. On the Line averaged 
$2,556 in 900 theaters.
Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at North 
American theaters, according to 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released 
Monday.
1. K-Pax, $17.5 million.
2.13 Ghosts, $15.7 million.
3. From Hell, $6.1 million.
4. Riding in Cars With Boys, $6 
million.
5. Training Day, $5.11 million.
6. Bandits, $5.05 million.
7. Serendipity, $3.9 million.
8. The Last Castle, $3.7 million.
9. Bones, $2.95 million.
10. Corky Romano, $2.9 million.
Country, techno, rap, and dub: reviewer departs 
from old favorites to try out new musical genres
ALBUMS, from page B7
from here, but they all combine to mean something greater. As you get 
deeper into the album, these sounds converge and diverge. Seventies 
disco beats and Donna Summer-esque background vocals fuse into the 
guitars which loop with heavy drums. For hardcore fans, this album can 
be seen as a continuum, a direct evolution from the moment you hit 
play. For novices such as myself, the whole work may be better regarded 
the way one takes to Surely Youre Joking, Mr. Feynmann (my favorite 
anecdotal novel), which is to dive in at random and just enjoy. Just press 
play and skip from Wild, Sweet, and Cool which has Tom Morello from 
Rage Against the Machine to Murder which features Scott Weiland 
(Stone Temple Pilots) to The Winner and youll figure things out. I like 
this album a lot simply because it enables the listener to choose their 
own path when exploring. As Im only a beginner, this would be a most
ly party album for me. Still, for those of us in the rock world that want a 
peek into this wide open country of techno/ambient/whatever, 
Tweekend is as good a jumping-off point as were gonna get. 
Recommended.
Bubba Sparxxx
Dark Days, Bright Nights
As I peer through the plastic case that separates me from the man 
they call Bubba, I pore over the various images he presents. Overall, its 
a southern trash motif (which I love) with the pit bull and the stripper 
and the lottery tickets and so on. Now I love southern rock and culture 
(on the skids?) in general. For the no-holds-barred, over-sexed raunchy 
rock that the South has been known to produce, no one tops Nashville 
Pussy out of Atlanta (via Vancouver!) Also hailing from Georgia is Mr. 
Sparxxx. Checking out this album is a guilty pleasure for me. As most of 
you have guessed, I am not a fan of rap-metal or such; but once in a 
while an album like this comes across my radar. So, what the hell.
After the average opener, Take off, I settle in for some olyokel rap, 
banjo-style. Bubba Talk is the clincher for me, really. In the words of 
the one they call Bubba,  ... yall dont know me at all. I say the same 
things, but just slower than yall In fact, he possesses just  ... little 
southern charm to top it off. Okee dokee, just that Bubba Talk. And so 
you see why I like this guy!
Anyone that can compete in a genre full of bravado and swagger 
like rap and still poke fun at himself and the stereotypes he grew up 
with like this is cool in my book. And if he can bring in various influ
ences that may seem completely out of place at first, then well even 
better. Look, Im not going to lie to you here; this is not an album Im 
pulling out to play everyday. However, having said that, I enjoyed 
what I heard, for the most part. Purely fun stuff, biting humour and a 
dont care attitude are always welcome in music. Now that Ive said 
my piece, look for me back in the metal section. Oh yeah, one more 
thing ... Spit, boy!

Bubba Sparxxx pulls off southern trash motif in his new album.
Courtesy of Long Beach Dub Allstars
The new Long Beach Dub Allstars album combines punk, dub, and rap.
Long Beach Dub Allstars
Wonders of the World
Some of my favorite people are dub fans. No, really! Back in Vancouver 
when I hosted the Underground Metal Massacre on 93.9 FM, my buddy 
Aaron had a show called Pirates of the Carribean right before us. The 
dude was always so calm and mellow ... So, curious about his drug of 
choice, I thought maybe I should include this genre on my list of experi
ments. And what better way to start than with a bunch of guys with tat
toos who call themselves Allstars ?
Well, the opening two tracks dont sound like the stuff Aaron played 
at all! In fact, its kind of guitar heavy and wait... is that an Anti-Flag tshirt I see one of the guys wearing? Yup. But, as we groove on into the 
third track it all comes back to me. Listen to the D.J.s is full of that 
Carribean mellowness I remember wafting through the air. The song 
commands us to listen to D.J.s around the globe, because this type of 
music will never grow old. Well, I dont know if I agree with that, but 
yeah I like it. Definitely a fun excursion into free and easy-spirited 
music. What strikes me most about this band is how universally positive 
it seems.
As the album progresses, there are more layers of punk guitar (and 
drums). Where oh where has the mellowness gone? Not to worry, it 
returns by track six. It seems that musical fusion is the order of the day 
here as they mix punk, dub, and rap seamlessly. Again, Im just learning 
about this stuff, and Im definitely happy to recommend this album to peo
ple like me who want an easy introduction to this style of music. Check it 
out if you have the chance.

All of ray friends were doing it. That was how it started. I just wanted to fit in with the 
crowd, write a little lemma for fun every now and then.
It happened to me by accident. 
I was taking a shower one morning when I realized the 
vast untapped potential of a certain domain.
On Friday nights we'd get together for a brainstorming session and usually after a few hours we'd have some minor result that would give us a buzz until the next day.
I spent all day that day working 
on it, and the next, and so on. Every step I made forward 
resulted in two more steps I 
needed to make, yet each time 
I was somehow convinced that X was almost there.
Pretty soon, though, that wasn't 
enough anymore. We had to spend a few sessions to do something substantial enough to get us excited. And then, one by one, 
people would quit showing up.
When I began rearranging my 
bowl of cereal obsessively in an attempt to visualize the process, I realized I had a 
problem.

than the eye can see. Thats why a caring touch
and understanding can sometimes be the most powerful tools of all.
