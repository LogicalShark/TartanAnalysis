Student recognized for heroism
by Rachita Chandra
Junior Staffwriter
Benjamin Saks had a rocky 
month last February. The archi
tecture fourth-years car broke 
down, two of his tires were 
slashed, and he was shot in the 
hand after helping a police offi
cer arrest a criminal.
Whats worse was that my ar
chitecture project deadline was 
very close, he said.
Such is the life of a hero.
Saks was granted this title, 
along with a bronze medal and 
a $4000 grant, by the Carnegie 
Hero Fund Commission on Sep
tember 28. The organization, 
which has no ties with Carnegie 
Mellon University, is a 21-mem
ber commission in Pittsburgh 
dedicated to honoring people 
who perform acts of heroism in 
the United States and Canada. 
They also provide financial assis
tance for those disabled and the 
dependents of those killed help
ing others.
Im very excited and honored, 
Saks said. Honestly, I dont re
ally think that Im a hero. I only 
did what I thought was right and 
I hope that others would do so 
too.
For Saks, last February 25 
started like a normal day. As a 
huge basketball fan, he decided 
to go to the Carnegie Mellon 
basketball game. He was all set 
to leave and was waiting for his

Nations cybersecurity chief returns to CMU
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
After two years and a ques
tionable $19,577,602 in salaries 
and contracts, the nations cy
bersecurity chief is returning to 
Carnegie Mellon.
Donald Andy Purdy has been 
on loan from the university to 
the Department of Homeland 
Securitys (DHS) National Cyber 
Security Division (NCSD) for the 
last two years. His term as acting 
director, which ended last Tues
day, has not been without contro
versy.
The Associated Press reported 
on September 22 that Purdy 
was leaving a position in which 
he worked under an unusual
agreement with a private univer
sity that does extensive business 
with the office he manages.
The article referred to $19 mil
lion in funding that Carnegie 
Mellons Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI) received from 
DHSs cybersecurity division, 
which Purdy directed, over the 
last two years, to help improve 
the security of industries and 
federal agencies. Purdy, mean
while, was still a university em
ployee and was paid $577,602 for 
the last two years. CBS News, The 
Washington Post, and other inter
national media outlets printed 
the article.
What the article did not men
tion was that the $19 million was 
a continuation of a contract from 
2001, three years before the gov
ernment requested Purdy.
There wasnt any new activity 
going on. It was all a continua
tion, but with a broader scope,
None of it is 
fabrication, but 
it lacks clarity.

manager of the computer emer

ment adds, deletes, and changes
tasks over time as priorities 
change.
CERT has worked with the fed
eral government since the early 
90s, helping the government 
make and meet cyber security 
standards in banking, insurance, 
law enforcement, telecommu
nications, and other key indus
tries.
I was not associated with 
decisions to increase or change 
things. None of it is fabrication, 
but it lacks clarity, Purdy said, 
referring to the Associated Press 
reports.

Mellon last Wednesday. Still 
a university employee, he will

Too many 
students, 
not enough 
tutorsPeer tutoring and SI must cut costs
by Claire Morgenstern
Assistant News Editor
The days of unlimited sup
plemental instruction and peer 
tutoring may be short-lived.
Starting next fall, the Office 
of Academic Development may 
be forced to cut its number of 
supplemental instruction (SI) 
leaders in half and reduce its 
walk-in tutoring sessions by 20 
percent. Already, students have 
seen their one-on-one tutoring 
sessions grow into one-on-two 
or three as the program has 
been forced to consolidate ap
pointments to accommodate 
all students seeking help.
Despite increased requests 
from students to make more 
tutoring available, financial 
constraints have forced Aca
demic Development to con
sider downsizing the program 
and come up with new ways to 
cut costs. The group is not real
locating funds  the programs 
annual budget of $370,000 is 
no longer enough to keep the 
program operating at its cur
rent level.
Its not a matter of cutting 
 they just dont have the re
sources, period, said Evan 
Osheroff, a sophomore in busi
ness administration and chair 
of Student Senates Academic 
Affairs Committee. Its such a 
successful program that they 
want more tutors, but its a mat
ter of money and resources.
When Provost Mark Kamlet, who is responsible for the 
budgets of campus programs 
such as those offered by Aca
demic Development, took of
fice in 2000, the programs 
budget was $129,130. Kamlet 
has increased that amount ev
ery year. Most recently, during 
the 2004-2005 academic year 
he added $50,000 to student 
tutors salaries and last year 
added an additional $30,000 to 
finance more full-time staff.

University to debut newly redesigned website
by David Chen
Staffwriter
Nationally recognized as a leader in com
puter engineering, computer science, and all 
things technology, Carnegie Mellon has left 
its own website unchanged for years. Now, 
www.cmu.edu is getting a facelift.
' Designed with feedback from the campus 
community and other visitors, the new site is 
hoped to improve the Carnegie Mellon web 
experience. Carnegie Mellon students have 
long complained about the current website. 
The website is not very intuitive, and the 
design is not attractive, said Robin Chen, a 
first-year in H&SS.
The new website features improved navi
gation and design, [and] more accessibility for 
a range of users, according to Marilyn Kail, 
assistant vice-president of marketing com
munications. The site is expected to.bring 
the Carnegie Mellon community together.
The features of the new website attempt to 
address the flaws of the current website.
More than a year ago, University Advance
ment and Computing Services recognized 
that we needed to use the Carnegie Mellon 
website as an opportunity to reflect the in
novative and distinctive personality of the 
university, Kail said.
According to Kail, Dan Boyarski, head of 
the School of Design, and webmasters across 
the university contributed expert advice to

the creation of the new site.
Development of the website involved feed
back from 16 groups of university stakehold
ers. Undergraduate and graduate students, 
alumni, and prospective students and their 
parents tested the site.
The new website is a definite improve
ment on the old, particularly in the visual 
aesthetic of the webpage, said Joannie Wu, 
a junior design major who tested the site.
The homepage, the entry page of the web
site, is designed to provide quick access to
current and up-to-date information.
A section of the homepage called Whats 
Happening provides a quick summary of 
campus events. Visitors will also be able to 
subscribe to a blog-style news feed to receive 
information as the site is updated.
A visually strong graphical element on 
the homepage will focus on a feature story 
that will change frequently to keep visitors

Education Dept plans new 
measures for universities
by Alexander Dileonardo
Junior Staffwriter
The Department of Education 
has unveiled its new plan for 
higher education, a plan which 
USA Today called No College 
Student Left Behind in a Sep
tember 27 article.
Secretary of Education Mar
garet Spellings announced 
the initiatives for U.S. colleges 
at the National Press Club on 
September 26. She proposed a 
multi-point action plan to make 
schools accountable, affordable, 
and accessible.
In her address, Spellings 
suggested evaluating student 
learning at colleges using stan
dardized tests and governmentregulated advisory programs.
External federal assessments 
would be a big change for schools 
such as Carnegie Mellon, which 
employ their own internal audits 
to evaluate individual learning 
objectives.
William Elliott, vice-president 
of enrollment, believes that fed
eral evaluations of schools such
as Carnegie Mellon are not nec
essary. He thinks the extensive 
internal assessment that the uni
versity already conducts every 
year is sufficient.
Carnegie Mellon is always 
striving towards perfection, 
and we are hard enough on our
selves, he said. We take our 
role and responsibility to the 
world very seriously, and we are 
doing the best we can.
The internal audit the uni
versity already has in place uses 
representatives from the board 
of trustees, peer colleges, indus
try, and government to assess 
the quality of the Carnegie Mel
lon program.
This year, the internal accred
itation review at Carnegie Mel
lon, which uses data from pro
fessors, students, and graduates, 
will specifically emphasize the 
evaluation of student learning.
Spellings also suggested us
ing standardized methods for 
assessing colleges progress. Ac
cording to the USA Today article, 
she proposed a tracking system

Looking for a more 
diverse staff
/ BreBradford Yankiver
Twenty-two months does not seem 
like a long period of time to hold a 
single job, but in the accelerated time 
frame of college, it feels like a life-long 
career. Ive served as publisher of The 
Tartan since January 1, 2005. Now, as 
I near the end of my time as a leader of 
The Tartan, I realize how much more 
I wish I could do for this organization 
and this campus.
The staff of The Tartan have done the 
impossible in the past two and a half 
years. After the atrocious 2004 April 
Fools publication called The Natrat, 
which included both racist and misogynistic material, this organization nearly 
collapsed.
But by giving dozens of hours per 
week, week after week, a new crop of 
leaders have turned this paper around. 
To see our work earning national rec
ognition for both our print and online 
editions is sweet, but its much sweeter 
to hear members of our own commu
nity refer to the turnaround weve ac
complished as the Phoenix-like rise of 
The Tartan.
All successes aside, we have much to 
do. In the last weeks that I serve The 
Tartan, I hope to set a course that will 
carry this newspaper forward after its 
100th birthday, which comes at the end 
of this month.
In particular, there is one issue I have 
not yet given adequate attention. When 
I step down, I must be confident that 
The Tartans staff will actively encour
age the input and participation of peo
ple from all realms of our community.
Our purpose is to inform students 
of the affairs and opinions that are 
relevant to them. Our success hinges 
on our ability to know what is relevant 
to students and how to report on it. 
We will not be successful unless the 
staff of The Tartan includes or is wellconnected with people from the broad 
array of the groups that make up our 
community.
Today, the staff of The Tartan, espe
cially the editorial staff  the group 
of about 29 editors and managers who 
lead the newspaper  is not reflective 
of the diversity of the broader Carnegie 
Mellon community. This tells me that 
we at The Tartan can do more to make 
sure that all people feel like they have a 
place here.
Not only can any student join this 
organization, any student with dedica
tion and talent can lead it. But it doesnt 
matter that I know this fact. What mat
ters is that people outside of the organi
zation know it.
Last week, I had the opportunity 
to visit the Multicultural Presidents 
Council. The MPC is a group of leaders 
from student organizations represent
ing various cultural groups on campus, 
including groups based on ethnic, gen
der, sexual orientation, religious, and 
other identities.
The meeting gave me an opportunity 
to express The Tartans commitment to 
being an actively inclusive student or
ganization, and it was a chance to gar
ner suggestions on reaching a broader 
cross-section of campus as we recruit 
and as we search for stories. The coun
cils feedback indicated that the way we 
recruit and the way we draw story ideas 
does not reach a broad enough spec
trum of the campus community.
It is our charge and responsibility to 
find ways to ensure that we actively 
and equitably include people from our 
community. Maybe this means includ
ing intentional outreach in recruiting. 
Maybe it means keeping special ties and 
regular meetings with certain organiza
tions like the MPC.
I dont claim that I know what steps 
The Tartan needs to take. I dont be
lieve there is any simple answer. But 
by discussing these issues among the 
members of the staff, seeking feedback 
from members of our community, and 
creating a strategy for reaching out to 
a broader spectrum of students, The 
Tartan will become a stronger organi
zation.

Unfortunately, in the brawl 
for the officers handgun, the 
suspect managed to get hold of 
the officers handgun, he said. 
Before we knew, the suspect 
pulled the trigger and the bul
let went straight through the 
holster and to my left hand.
I was really incredibly 
lucky it could have been 
much worse. If the bullet was 
even a millimeter closer, the 
doctors say that I could have 
lost three of my left hands fin
gers. I try not thinking of what 
could have happened.
The suspect was finally ardrugs, he said.
So would he do it again?
If somebody needs help, Im 
definitely going to be there for 
them, he said. Though I would 
try not getting shot next time. 
Im not the type of person that 
would turn their back on a per
son at a trying time.
Saks said the encounter has 
given him an appreciation of ac
tions and their consequences.
I value life much more, he 
said. I admire those people on 
duty who are willing to put their 
life at stake to protect others to a 
much greater extent.
When hes not helping police 
officers, Saks spends his time 
modeling projects for architec
ture, relaxing with friends, go
ing fishing and camping, and
If somebody needs help, Im definitely 
going to be there for them. Though I 
would try not getting shot next time.
 Ben Saks
rested on the arrival of two 
other police officers.
Following this, an ambulance 
rushed Saks to the hospital, 
where he received 30 stitches.
It wasnt until after the en
counter that my hand really 
began to hurt, he said. Even 
weeks later, it was pretty bad. 
'I had to clean the wound every 
day and it became really hard 
to sleep. I remember having a 
trail of thoughts of the guns 
trigger being suspended and 
a chill running through my 
spine.
Brushing off the pain in his 
hand, he finished the looming 
architecture project, winning 
an honorable mention award 
for his work.
Despite all this, the most ful
filling feeling comes in know
ing that the drug dealer wont 
be selling heroin anymore and 
that by helping the policeman, 
not only did I save the cops 
life, but also the life of all those 
that would be consuming those
playing bass guitar.
It was the fact that I really 
wanted to play my bass guitar 
that motivated me to recover' 
faster, he said. In fact, I even 
turned down the hospitals of
fer of providing me with physi
cal therapy because playing the 
bass guitar was my real physical 
therapy.
As for the $4000 and medal 
that he received from the Carne
gie Hero Fund, he said he would 
put the money in his savings or 
make a necklace of the medal 
and show it off.
Im currently single, so I 
wouldnt mind spending the 
money on someone.
He considered donating 
the money, but reasoned that 
since the grant itself was a dona
tion, the purpose of the award 
would be defeated if [he] do
nated it.
Does this hero plan to join the 
FBI after tackling crime? If the 
FBI needs any architects, Im 
ready to build the world.

ADVISING, from Al
However, student demand 
for tutoring services has risen 
even more steeply. The number 
of students attending walk-in 
tutoring sessions rose from 320 
during the 1997-1998 academic 
year to 3887 last year. Similarly, 
only 191 students requested pri
vate tutoring sessions during 
the 1999-2000 school year; last 
year, that number rose to 3725.
The need has increased so 
much that we cant keep up with 
it and will continue to increase 
into the forseeable future, said 
Susan Ambrose, assistant pro
vost for education.
SI leaders for 13 courses cur
rently run two hour-long supple
mentary instruction sessions per 
week. As early as this spring, Ac
ademic Development may down
size the number of courses to as 
few as five.
Walk-in tutoring is currently 
held for two and a half hours a 
night, five nights a week, in 15 
different subjects. The program 
has traditionally been held in 
two locations, the Mudge Library 
and the Donner Reading Room. 
This year welcomed additional 
services in the West Wing Tech 
Room on Mondays and Wednes
days in four subjects. The new 
changes would reduce tutoring 
time by half an hour per night in 
each location.
Ambrose believes that the in
creased demand can be traced to 
high schools growing concerns 
about test scores as a result of the 
No Child Left Behind Act. High 
school teachers, she explained, 
have been forced to tailor their 
lesson plans toward teaching 
strategies that will help students 
solve more problems on the test 
but not necessarily provide them 
with the basic skills they will 
need to master more difficult ma
terial in college.
Its a complex problem, and 
its beyond our control, Ambrose 
said.
By college, students who have 
grown accustomed to being tu
tored throughout high school 
often request a private tutor for a 
course before even attending the 
first class.

ized, Osheroff said he is not sure 
how much students know about 
the proposal and that he cannot 
yet gauge student reactions to 
the cuts. Of the several SI lead
ers contacted, none of them were 
aware of the budget issues the 
program is facing.
I dont know anything about 
that, said SI leader Pratik Barasia, a junior in electrical and 
computer engineering and eco
nomics.
However, once they find out, 
Osheroff expects a negative reac
tion.
I expect students to be mad, 
he said.
Once the plans are officially 
proposed, Osheroff plans to hold 
forums to give students the op
portunity to voice their opinions 
and suggestions.
If students and faculty prove 
that the program is important 
enough, he believes, the univer
sity will find a way to keep it on 
campus.
It depends on whether or not 
[Academic Development] gets 
enough funding, he said, but 
things do happen when they 
need to.
The Career Center and Office 
of Academic Development were
year courses are seeing brighter 
students who are less prepared, 
Ambrose said.
She does not think that the 
need for tutoring has grown be
cause of poorly structured in
tro, courses or bad teachers. In 
fact, she said that introductory 
courses are often taught by the 
universitys most experienced 
professors.
She stressed that the program 
places an emphasis on support
ing first-years in making the 
adjustment from high school to 
college and will continue to offer 
SI for first-year physics, chemis
try, biology, and math students, 
even at the expense of cutting 
additional instruction for higherlevel courses.
For the long term, Ambrose 
and her colleagues are collect
ing data from both students who 
are struggling in the courses and 
faculty who are teaching them to 
gain a better understanding of 
the types of problems students 
are having. With this informa
tion, professors can tailor their 
courses to cover challenging ma
terial in greater depth so fewer 
students need tutoring.
They are also looking into what 
students are doing to prepare for
the course in addition to tutor
ing, wondering if students are 
using free, individual instruc
tion as an easy way out in lieu of 
attending lecture and recitation, 
keeping up with the reading, or 
speaking with the professor. Am
brose stressed that students can 
help by signing in at every SI or 
tutoring session they attend.
Now we have to ask the hard 
questions, and thats what well 
be doing for the next two years, 
Ambrose said. [The data] will 
allow us to know what programs 
are important for the kinds of 
problems students are having.
Ambrose hopes that explaining 
the benefits of the Academic De
velopment programs to alumni 
when asking for their yearly do
nations may solicit additional 
funds.
Though Student Senate is in 
charge of allocating money to 
programs on campus, Osheroff 
said that Senates ability to help 
is limited.
Theres not a whole lot that 
Senate can do, he said. Our 
big goal is funding student orga
nizations on campus, and with 
our budget, we just dont have 
$20,000 to give them.

Cybersecurity chief steps down
Secretary of Education Spellings 
reveals plans for higher education
EDUCATION, from A1
that would,compare individual 
performances of both student 
and graduates to evaluate col
leges.
Caroline Acker, a history pro
fessor in H&SS, is concerned 
with how federal standards will 
interface with the universitys 
current initiatives.
Any attempt to measure col
lege student learning through 
standardized measures also 
threatens to stifle curricular in
novation, she said. Project 
courses bring students from 
different disciplines together. 
They also give students the 
opportunity to engage with 
community-based organiza
tions and work out theoretically 
sound, real-world understand
ings of problems.
Acker said she also lacks faith 
in the governments ability to 
measure the undergraduate re
search opportunities.
Spellings announced her plans 
to use a database to streamline 
the financial aid application pro
cess by integrating IRS data with 
academic progress data. This 
would enable colleges to' notify 
students of their eligibility to re
ceive assistance as early as pos
sible.
Some students disagree with
the idea of a federal database.
There is no reason they need 
that information, said Jimmy 
Dougherty, a sophomore history 
major.
Elliott also has concerns about 
privacy, but he admits a data
base would help streamline the 
process.
Applying for federal aid can 
be bureaucratic; this may help, 
he said. It would be easier to 
link the financial aid application 
to the IRS.
In conjunction with this, Spell
ings also announced she will be 
allocating more money to col
leges for financial aid. The De
partment of Education wants to 
use funds to encourage colleges 
to publicize student learning 
outcomes.
Linda M. Anderson, director 
of student financial assistance 
and services, would have pre
ferred that Spellings affordabil
ity initiatives be focused on Pell 
Grants.
All schools want more Pell 
Grants, she said.
Pell Grants are based on a 
formula that divides the sum of 
the grants from the government 
among the neediest applicants'. 
Anderson feels that it is the ideal 
way to give financial aid because 
it comes with no provisions.
In defense of her plans lack of
an increase in Pqll Grants, Spell
ings noted that in a time of war 
and budget deficits it is hard 
to make such a strong commit
ment.
We all share a commitment 
to Pell, Spellings said in her ad
dress, noting that after negoti
ating the budget, she can verify 
specific dollar amounts.
Anderson is hopeful, as the 
federal government granted an 
increase in eligibility to Carne
gie Mellon this year. The Higher 
Education Reconciliation Act al
located approximately $500,000 
to the University.
Pell Grants are an open dis
cussion, Anderson said. The 
budget has to support it.
Elliott also understands the 
complexities of Pell Grants but 
questions the involvement of the 
federal government in assessing 
which schools get more or less 
money.
Acker shares Elliotts concern 
about federal involvement in 
individual college objectives: 
Since a key component of a 
liberal education is the ability 
to' frame problems  not just 
to devise answers - its hard to 
imagine how a standardized test 
could be a true measure of the 
kind of learning we want to have 
happen in colleges and universi
ties.
University to unveil new website
WEB, from Al
campus happenings.
Feature stories will be cat
egorized into themes, including 
practical problem solving, inter
disciplinary collaboration, inno
vation and creativity, the global 
university, and beyond the class
room.
A Submit Story/Photo link 
under the feature story invites 
the campus community to sub
mit story ideas and photographs 
to be considered for the homep
age. This feature allows the 
campus community to be more 
involved in the content shown on
the site..
The sites navigation structure 
is designed to improve the cur
rent site. According to Kail, the 
site has been designed to be func
tional' for both casual visitors, 
who look through various pages 
on the site* and visitors who are 
seeking specific information 
through the search feature.
In addition, a new feature 
called QuickLinks helps visi
tors to the site find frequently ac
cessed pages.
The new website is a collab
orative effort of University Ad
vancement, Computing Services 
and Enrollment Services. Ripple
Effects Interactive, a full-service 
interactive marketing agency 
based in Pittsburgh, was selected 
to create the new design.
The website will be managed 
by Marketing Communications, 
a department within University 
Advancement, and Computing 
Services. Updates are expected 
to be made to the website regu
larly. Future improvements, in
cluding better search capabili
ties and multimedia content, are 
planned.
The new website will be 
launched the week of October 30 
and will replace the current web
site at www.cmu.edu.

a letter to ranking Republicans 
complaining about Purdys con
tract. In addition, the letter cited 
a Government Accounting Office 
report claiming that the NCSD 
has not fully addressed any of 
the key responsibilities related 
to cybersecurity.
There were many millions of 
dollars unaccounted for, said 
Carrie Brooks, the communica
tions director for Representative 
Loretta Sanchez (DCalif.).
The Department of Homeland 
Security reimbursed Carnegie 
Mellon about $245,000 a year for 
Purdys salary, while Carnegie 
Mellon contributed an additional 
$43,000.
The sheer value of the salary
 which outpaces not only the 
salaries of the Department Sec
retary, but also Members of Con
gress, the Vice-President, and the 
Justices of the Supreme Court ... 
raises questions about whether 
the American People are getting 
their moneys worth, stated the 
letter, dated June 15, from Rep
resentatives Sanchez, Bennie 
Thompson (D-Mich.), and Zoe 
Lofgren (D-Calif.).
I met with the staff of [that] 
House committee in August, and 
they didnt ask me any questions 
about the IPA during that, said 
Purdy. IPA refers to the Inter
governmental Personnel Act, a 
program begun in 1971. Under 
an IPA, which lasts two years, the 
government can hire non-federal 
employees to take leave from 
their outside positions and then 
reimburse their salaries.
When government isnt able 
to find a skill set, they are able 
to go to industry and institutions 
to find someone with the back
ground and skills needed to fill 
that job, Pethia said.
A month later, during pub
lic testimony, the cybersecu
rity chiefs IPA was brought up 
again. Purdy said that during his 
supervisors testimony, a mem
ber of the committee asked him 
to speak and answer questions 
about his IPA.
Given the fact that they had 
met with me in August without 
asking me any questions about
the IPA, I was surprised that in 
the middle of the hearing they 
asked me to testify, he said. It 
didnt seem like they prepared 
in the most efficient way for the; 
public hearing.
Purdy has been working for 
Carnegie Mellon since November. 
of 2003. Prior to his work at the 
SEI, Purdy was involved with fed
eral sentencing commissions.
I was very active in trying to 
understand criminal offenses 
in technology, he said. Among 
the kinds of technology Purdy 
focused on were counterfeiting, 
ID theft, and cellular telephone 
cloning.
Pethia said the SEI hired Purdy 
to help CERT coordinate with cy
ber laws and policy.
He was working and had a 
good working relationship with 
people in the [Department of 
Homeland Security], Pethia 
said. Some people say he doesnt 
know about security. With the 
Presidents Critical Infrastruc
ture Protection Board, he spent 
years reviewing findings of ear
lier groups. He went around the 
country, too, meeting thousands 
of system operators, system us
ers, network operators, technol
ogy producers, and security ex
perts.
Carnegie Mellon has long 
been recognized for the SEIs
work with the federal govern
ment, dating back to 1988 with 
the inception of the CERT pro
gram.
pur charter is to protect any
one on the Internet, Pethia said. 
Thpre ar,e over 200 incident re
sponse gfoups, many of them are 
trained by us.
Government entities in Aus
tralia, Japan, and England, as 
well as ExxonMobil, Microsoft, 
Oracle, and over 600 other tech 
vendors are among the SEIs col
laborators.
With only a decade or two of 
worldwide Internet activity, cy
bersecurity is still a developing 
industry, compared with other 
more tangible forms of security, 
such as that at airports or bor
ders.
New laws and standards are 
being implemented regularly 
across the globe, according to 
Pethia, who claims that Purdy 
is one of the few experts with a 
combined understanding of law, 
operational security issues, and 
private and government sector 
organization interaction.
If youre Exxon or Coca-Cola, 
what do you do to meet inter
national commands? he said.

ECE students invention 
may save firefighters lives
by Sarah Mogin
Assistant Pillbox Editor
After sustaining a certain 
amount of exposure, carbon fil
ters need to be replaced  the 
question is how often.
One Carnegie Mellon student 
has found an answer, and its 
part of work being done at the 
Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy.
Sarah Bednairs team is just 
one of many groups of students 
working on projects in CITs 
electrical and computer engi
neering department. One team 
has been working with accel
erometers, devices that can be 
used to monitor deceleration in 
cars. Other groups are focused 
on projects involving micromir
rors, which are used in some 
types of high-definition televi
sions.
But Bednairs team has de
cided to focus on improving 
the safety firefighters and other 
emergency workers who use gas 
masks.
Bednair, a Ph.D. candidate, 
recently designed a vapor-sensing device that could potentially 
benefit firefighters.
Her work is part of a four-year 
project funded by the National 
Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH), the 
Dowd Fellowship, and the Mul
tidisciplinary University Re
search Initiative (MURI), which 
is backed by the Air Force. Bed
nair has been working with a 
team of about a dozen other 
students.
Their objective is to create 
a sensor for the carbon filters 
in masks worn by firefighters. 
Rescue workers are frequently 
exposed to toxic gases such as 
carbon monoxide, and they rely 
on the filters in their breathing 
respirators for protection. But 
these filters eventually wear 
out.
The problem is right now its 
very arbitrary how often they 
throw away cartridges, said 
Bednair. Theres no way of 
determining when the lives of 
the^e filters are over.

Several fossils of plesiosaurs 
and ichthyosaurs were recently 
uncovered by Norwegian pale
ontologists on Svalbard, an Arc
tic island chain.
The ichthyosaurs and plesio
saurs, colossal-aqtia dinosaurs 
not unlike the legendary Loch 
Ness, were among the most 
complete ever found. One ple
siosaur was so large the team 
nicknamed it Monster.
They plan to compare similar 
British fossils with the new Arc

turn to the excavation site in the 
coming summer.

Google to possibly 
acquire YouTube
Google Inc., along with sev-al other companies, is in talks 
to acquire YouTube Inc., the 
popular online video website. A 
YouTube official estimated the 
price of the acquisition to be 
near $1.6 billion. The reported 
price tag is a relatively small por
tion of the search engine giants 
assets; Google has $10 billion in 
cash on hand.
YouTube surpassed traffic on 
Googles video site in February. 
By July, about 30.5 million peo
ple visited YouTube, compared 
to only about one-third as many

to Nielsen/NetRatings.

Todays information age has boomed 
with the success of the Internet. The In
ternet is a powerful resource for finding 
information, connecting with friends, 
and doing whatever web browsing one 
desires.
Nearly endless quantities of informa
tion, lar^e amounts of which are per
sonal, flow through the World Wide Web 
every day. However, as with all things, 
there are downsides to using the Inter
net. A huge concern for most Internet 
users is the protection of information, 
also known as cybersecurity. Cybersecu
rity involves protecting user information 
from any nonapproved party, be it a com
pany or an online snoop.
A young virtual audience
A recent survey conducted by i-SAFE, 
Inc., an Internet safety educational
group, found that over 70 percent of stu
dents access the Internet at least once a 
week. About one-third of all the students 
surveyed used instant messaging and email to contact friends over the Internet.

MBA programs suffer from 
this homogeneity of message, 
look, and feel, said Deb Magness, executive director of mar
keting communications at Tepper. The last thing we want to 
be is a commodity in this cat
egory.
MBA Reality Check is an in
formational website With ac
companying print and online 
advertisements. The site is en
hanced with rich media, includ
ing Flash animations, video, and 
podcasts.
Tepper is the first business 
school to use PointRoll rich-media advertising.
PointRoll banners allow the 
visitor to hover the mouse oyer 
the banner and see an expanded 
banner with a video presenta
tion.
According to the website, 
MBA Reality Check is Teppers

Google asks students for gad
by Shawn Wertz
Science & Technology Editor
The Internet just got more 
creative  for university and 
college students across the coun
try, at least. Google Inc. recently 
announced the beginning of 
the Google Gadget Awards, in 
which students will be able to 
submit their versions of virtual 
gadgets.
Gadgets are typically simple 
tools with an interface for us
ers. They can vary from some
thing useful, like a calculator, to 
something more fun, like a piece 
of artwork.
Though the technological gi
ant receives search requests 
from every continent, including 
Antarctica, Google isnt just in 
the search engine business any
more.
Google currently offers users 
the chance to personalize their 
computer desktops and Internet 
blog spaces with Google Gad
gets.
Its about being innovative 
and creative, and putting all of 
your skills to use to create some
thing that would be of value to 
someone, said Rachel Garb, 
a Carnegie Mellon computer
t
science alumna and Google em
ployee.
The competition is open to all 
college and university students. 
Garb said that advanced pro
gramming skills are not required. 
Im not really that much into 
programming, and I created one, 
she said.
Competitors can submit gad
gets in two different types, 
desktop gadgets and universal 
gadgets.
Desktop gadgets can be down
loaded to a users desktop. Google 
currently offers users the ability 
to check the temperature, and 
play a quick game of checkers on 
their home computer desktop. 
But Google Gadgets arent only 
limited to the desktop. Universal 
gadgets can be placed on a users 
webpage or blog.
We think that homepage gad
gets are great for people who want 
to check things all the time, said 
Sunny Gettings, a PR representa
tive for Google.
The gadgets will be judged 
across eight categories, includ
ing best overall desktop gadget, 
best overall universal gadget, 
gadget most likely to get you a 
date, and most intelligent gad
get.
Randal Bryant, School of Comi
Courtesy of Google
puter Science dean, will be judg
ing most addictive gadget. 
CMU is one of the great insti
tutions for engineering, innova
tion, and creativity, said Garb. 
We want to have CMU students 
get a taste of the kinds of things 
they can do at Google.
The submitted gadgets will 
be available online for mass use. 
Garb said that the gadgets can 
be anything a competitor can 
dream.
Its so open, said Garb. The 
more creative, the better.

University creates 
robot drummer
The music program at Geor
gia Tech is marching to the beat 
of a different drummer, a robot 
named Haile. The robot, is the 
creation of Georgia Tech pro
fessor Gil Win Weinberg and 
graduate student Scott Driscoll. 
Weinberg and Driscoll are both 
inyolved in the entertainment 
technology program.
Weinberg and Driscoll wanted 
their robot musician to be much 
more than a mere metronome, 
able to listen and adapt to 
given music. Haile can listen for 
changes in beat and rhythm and 
improvise her own percussion 
line.
Unlike a stereotypical robot, 
Haile is made of wood and styled 
after humans, with a head, two 
legs, and arms. Audiences on her 
world tours have been delighted 
and stunned by Weinbergs cre
ation, but the professor insists 
that this is only the beginning of 
robotics in music.

There is no completely effective child

9 October 2006THE TARTAN
The website takes a new ap
proach in marketing. Instead of 
just describing the benefits of an 
MBA program, the Tepper web
site provokes potential appli
cants to decide what they really 
want from an MBA.
Our strategy was to engage 
the prospective student in a dif
ferent, more relevant, strategic 
way, said Magness.
The marketing campaign uses 
the concept of reality checks, 
content intended to challenge 
prospective students to consider 
the long-term significance of 
their business school decision.
The five themes of the reality 
checks are career impact, confi
dence to succeed, ways of think
ing, community, and legacy.
A recently discovered planet 
orbits its star so closely that a 
new year comes every 10 hours.
Called SWEEPS-10, the planet 
belongs to a newfound class of 
planets called ultra-short-period 
planets, so called because they 
have orbits of less than one 
Earth day.
The Hubble Space Telescope 
recently spotted five of the 
swift planets, all about the size 
of Jupiter. The planets are lo
cated in a crowded star field in
our Milky Way galaxy as part 
of an exoplanet survey called 
the Sagittarius Window Eclips

How Things Work: Botox
Simran Grover
Botox injections are one of 
the fastest growing cosmetic 
procedures in popularity in the 
beauty industry according to 
the American Society for Aes
thetic Plastic Surgeons. This 
wonder injection caused a stir. 
in the aesthetic industry when 
it was introduced, primarily 
because it removes unwanted 
wrinkles and can reduce neck
bands.
For the majority of users, who 
are between 25 and 65 years 
old, Botox is an effective way 
to gain a youthful appearance. 
But how exactly does this anti
wrinkle serum work?
Botox is actually the short
ened term for botulinum toxin
A, a therapeutic agent derived 
from the bacterium Clostridium 
botulinum, the bacterium that 
is behind the food poisoning 
botulism.
The bacteria contain seven 
variations of the botulinum 
toxin  A through G  and 
the effects vary for each one. 
Paralysis is the most serious 
symptom of botulism; its less se
vere cousin, Botox, merely par
alyzes smaller muscles whose 
contractions cause wrinkles in 
a persons skin.
Botox reacts with acetylcho
line, the neurotransmitter that 
is responsible for muscle con
tractions. The toxin primarily 
blocks nerve endings, which 
therefore block the transmis
sion of acetylcholine. Some 
toxins also attack the proteins 
that assist in the release of ace
tylcholine.
The place in a persons body 
where the toxin takes effect 
is crucial. Because the tox
ins block the signals that tell 
muscles to contract, if the toxin 
attacks the heart, it can become 
difficult and even impossible 
for the heart to pump blood.
But other muscle contrac
tions are less crucial to human 
life. Wrinkles, for example, are 
caused by repetitive muscle con
tractions from years of smiles
and frowns.
With Botox, a muscle cannot 
contract, so the skin above it 
cannot wrinkle.
The FDA has approved the 
use of Botox for smoothing the 
lines that often form between 
a persons eyebrows, otherwise 
known as glabellar lines.
An individual can have Botox 
injections on other parts of his 
or her body, but those that are. 
used in other places are termed 
off-label and are neither ap
proved nor banned.
A surgeon will typically use a 
microneedle when injecting Bo
tox into a patient. This serves to 
minimize any possible discom
fort. Common side effects in
clude headache, flu symptoms, 
and nausea.
Botox has been successful at 
treating spasms and involuntary 
muscle contractions. When Bo
tox is injected into the muscles 
surrounding a particular area, 
then the muscles in that area 
remain relaxed, easing spasms
and involuntary contractions.
The effects of an injection 
can last anywhere from three 
to eight months: Because it is 
injected into the certain muscle 
group, Botox does . not affect 
neighboring muscles. But if it 
is injected in the wrong place 
near the eyes, a person can end 
up with droopy eyelid muscles, 
a condition that can last for 
weeks.
In 1989, Botox was approved 
to treat two eye muscle disor
ders: blepharospasm (uncon
trollable blinking) and strabis
mus (misaligned eyes).
In 2000, it was approved to 
treat cervical dystonia, a neuro
logical movement disorder that 
causes severe neck and shoul
der contractions.
In 2002, the FDA acknowl
edged that the injection was 
effective in reducing frown 
lines for up to 120 days.
Botox has become very com
mercialized since it was first 
introduced. Some users throw
Julia Li/Art Staff
Botox parties that include 
cocktail parties, seminars, and 
socials.
The parties serve two func
tions: Friends can get the 
procedure done together and 
less expensively, because medi
cine is cheaper in bulk.
But Botox injections should 
not be taken lightly. The FDA 
has warned that a Botox injec
tion is a medical procedure 
and it should be performed in a 
proper, medical setting, where 
an emergency situation can be 
handled.
Also, the ingestion of alcohol 
could worsen bruising at the in
jection site.
People who want to have the 
procedure done should make 
sure to find a certified practitio
ner. More and more unqualified 
people are dispensing Botox in 
hotel rooms, gyms, salons, and 
offices, increasing the risk of 
improper technique, inappro
priate dosages, and unsanitary 
conditions.
Our courses in filmmaking, animation, 
photography and more 
can be taken for CMU credit!

Student finds way to gauge
carbon cartridge levels
FIRE, from A7
to this question, but their data 
does not take into actount the 
fact that different firefighters 
encounter different levels f 
toxic gases. It is impossible to 
determine the life of a carbon 
filter at an invariant amount of 
time. .
Its an accumulation level of 
exposure, said Bedna,ir. The 
problem is that they dont know 
what theyre being exposed to 
and what are the concentra
tions.
This flaw that was present in 
the original filter system first 
caught the attention of NIOSH 
after the September 2001 attacks 
on the World Trade Center.
They ran out of cartridges, 
Bednair said. They didnt have 
the means to know when the 
service life was over, so they 
just picked an arbitrary time., a 
few hours or something.
Bednair created a mass-sensitive device that monitors the 
service life of the cartridges. 
We want to integrate all dif
ferent types of sensors onto a 
single chip, she said.
The device begins at a set 
mass. When on, the device oscil
lates at a regulated frequency as 
surrounding air passes through 
the carbon filter.
The device also consists of a 
sensitive outer layer that is set 
to absorb certain gases. As it
absorbs the gases, the device 
becomes heavier.
The mjisk detects the mass 
oKthe oscillating device. When 
enough to 
the cartridge is
b___indicates to the
firefighter that it needs to be re
placed.
Btjt the process of developing 
jherdeVjcefhas not been without 
setbacks. ^>r one thing, the team 
nas had some trouble with tem
perature rejection.
In any given climate, the tem
perature is never a constant 
value.
Everyday fluctuations in 
weather and humidity can affect 
the accuracy of the device.
Even the humidity in a fire
fighters breath is a factor that 
has to be considered.
Its a challenge, Bednair said. 
How do you reject these changes 
that you see every day?
Bednair has also been strug
gling to integrate the outer layer 
to the mass-sensitive device.
You cant stick a mass sensor 
out in the air without putting 
a sensitive layer on top of the 
mass sensor, she said. Bednair 
had to make the sensor smaller 
in order for it to function inside 
the outer layer.
As soon as Bednair finds solu
tions to the current problems, 
her device will be ready for use 
nationwide. Each sensor will 
cost only about a dollar.
Bednairs sensors are small enough to fit inside firefighters cartridges.

dresses or names can often come 
up in conversation.
Children sometimes do not 
understand that when they tell 
other people that information, 
they could be releasing personal 
information into the wrong 
hands.
Cybersecurity encompasses 
the preventative measures 
needed to avoid any accidental 
sharing of personal informa
tion.
A joint venture was formed 
between the Information Net
works Institutes CyLab at Carn
egie Mellon and i-SAFE Inc. to 
address the issue.
The team created Carnegie 
Cadets, a web-based game to 
teach preventative cybersecu
rity for kids aged eight to 10.
Thats probably one of the big
gest problems for that age range, 
said Amanda Kraemer, the proj
ects creative lead. They just 
dont understand that everything 
they put on places like MySpace 
is...accessible to everyone.
Sharing information is defi
nitely a big issue for kids when
they first get online. They get into 
a chat room and they dont know 
who theyre talking to, so they as
sume everyone is friendly, said 
David Doyle, the games multime
dia and software testing coordi
nator.
They can easily jeopardize
formation secure with a super
hero story.
Throughout the game, players 
learn different aspects of cyberse
curity by playing interactive mini 
games.
After each game, players are 
asked to help out a fellow virtual

themselves without even know
ing it.
Playing the online name game
Carnegie Cadets Was devel
oped using Adobe Flash. The 
team wanted to keep the inter
face simple and entertaining for 
their younger audience, and so 
the game uses vector art to give it 
a cartoonish look.
The game introduces concepts 
relevant to keeping personal in
cadet with their newfound cyber
security knowledge. If they suc
ceed, they are rewarded. Plans 
for the game call for 10 to 12 mis
sions.
Its kind of bverwhelming until 
you really break it down into little 
bits. The whole game is broken 
down into mini bits like smaller 
games, said Charles Brandt, 
technical artist and animator.
Current topics include sort
ing through inappropriate e-mail 
and sharing personal information
online. This approach to edutain
ment is one that the development 
team thinks is essential to the suc
cess of the project.
One of the biggest challenges 
is that edutainment, as it stands 
now, really hasnt worked in the 
past, and one of the main reasons 
is that theyre not keeping the 
kids attention, said Doyle.
The team is putting their game 
to the test with Pittsburgh stu
dents.
The Fox Chapel School Dis
trict just started using Carnegie 
Cadets in four of its elementary 
schools: Kerr, Fairview, OHara, 
and Hartwood.
The school district received 
the software last week and is 
conducting test runs with its el
ementary students.
We really want to try to cre
ate more awareness, said Bill 
Gusky, coordinator of informa
tion technology for the Fox Cha
pel School District.
The full game is expected to 
be released in January 2007. iSAFE Inc. will be the primary 
distributor of the game. The 
company will offer the game to 
select schools.
Carnegie Cadets teaches kids about cybersecurity (above). David Doyle, 
the teams multimedia coordinator, exnlains the games eraohics fbelow).
Web advertising tells students the right reasons for getting an MBA
BUSINESS, from A7
The site also addressed those stu
dents who continue to visit the website 
from month to month before applying 
to an MBA program.
The content on the microsite com
pletely shifts every month, said Magness. There are five reality checks over 
the next six months.
In addition to the reality check section, 
the website is split into three sections: 
real students, real careers, and this site.
The real students section features 
Tepper student profiles and blogs. The 
blogs are described as up-front and un-- 
cut by the website.
By going in the real careers sec
tion, prosepctive MBA students can also 
check up on recruiter ranking, starting 
salaries of past MBA students, as well as 
alumni insights.
sThe website has frank  and some
times even sarcastic  wording as part 
of the sites realistic feel. The site men
tions that the frequency of workshops 
that provide tips on your wardrobe and 
catchy cocktail ice breakers, are, urn,
not the best way to evaluate your MBA 
return on investment.
What were doing is allowing the 
prospective student to dive into the re
ality check and immerse himself or her
self in what is pertinent at that moment 
in time, said Magness.
To get the word out about MBA Real
ity Check, Tepper is using both tradi
tional advertising as well as innovative 
rich-media advertising.
[Tepper targets] an ambitious and 
web-savvy audience that is pressed for 
time, said Steve Hay, account director 
at Ripple Effects Interactive.
With this in mind, we knew we 
needed to go beyond traditional ban
ner ads and deliver an impression that 
would be compelling and engaging. 
According to a Tepper press release, 
advertisements promoting the MBA 
Reality Check website are running on 
MBA-Zone.com, BusinessWeek.com, 
USNews.com, and the Dow Jones net
work.
In addition, teaser videos were placed 
on YouTube, Google Video, and Yahoo! 
Video.
The online nature of the marketing 
campaign is-helping Tepper reach pro
spective students globally.
We knew we needed to 
go beyond traditional 
banner ads and deliver an 
impression that would be 
compelling and engaging.
 Steve Hay
When we are on the road all over the 
world, at admissions fairs, were having 
students approach us wanting to talk 
about the reality checks, said Magness. 
At the MBA admissions fair in India, 
there were a number of students who 
came to the Tepper booth asking when 
we would get the next reality check [on
line].
The campaign runs from September 
through January. The site is available at

Elizabeth Liu/Art StaffClosing gaps in campus security
Inconsistent security afflicts campus
In light of two recent, brazen crimes 
on and around campus (the September 
25 robbery of a student in a University 
Center bathroom and the October 1 as
sault of two students cutting through 
the WQED parking lot), the Carnegie 
Mellon community should discuss how 
it can close certain gaps in its security 
practices.
The security of buildings on and off 
campus is inconsistent. The University 
Center and many academic buildings 
maintain very high safety standards 24 
hours a day. They are well lit, and re
quire Carnegie Mellon ID to enter after 
hours. As popular spots on campus, they 
are constantly occupied, if only by Facili
ties Management Services workers.
However, other buildings dont follow 
this example. Margaret Morrison is open 
24 hours a day, too, but the rotundas re
volving doors are rarely locked. Design 
students are known to work irregular 
hours in their studios, and must often 
deal with the theft of their expensive 
supplies. While a missing drafting pen
cil isnt headline news, petty larceny 
often precipitates more serious crimes.
If Margaret Morrison develops a reputa
tion as an easy target, the problem could 
quickly escalate. We should secure all 
our buildings in the style of the Univer
sity Center or Baker Hall.
Security in residence halls is a trickier 
situation. Most dormitories have roundthe-clock desk attendants to look out 
for suspicious persons trying to enter 
the building, but attendants are often 
preoccupied with homework or other 
distractions. Moreover, most students, 
out of courtesy, will hold the door for 
people behind them, who enter the 
building without ever showing ID to the 
attendant.
Recent changes in desk attendance 
policy have improved this situation; in
stead of circulating around campus, at
tendants now have a home desk where 
they work exclusively. This allows them 
to become better acquainted with the 
individual students in a building and to 
more easily spot interlopers. However, 
this policy will only improve security if 
attendants vigilantly keep watch over 
who enters the building.
A third area to examine is outdoor
spaces off campus where students might 
be vulnerable to crime. The shortcut 
from the Morewood Gardens parking 
lot to Fifth Avenue via WQED is a per
fect example. Students traverse that 
path at all hours, yet it is secluded and 
features only an odd dotting of steppingstones across the small ravine separat
ing Morewood from WQED. In 2004, 
civil engineering students built a small 
. bridge across the ravine for use during 
heavy rainfall. However, its situated at 
the end of the ravine and not the most 
direct path. If that bridge were more vis
ible and thoughtfully placed, it would be 
much more useful.
Now that the Carnegie Mellon police 
force has moved its headquarters to 
Filmore Street, its beefed-up presence in 
east Oakland should help deter wouldbe criminals. However, there are sev
eral simple, concrete steps that we can 
take now to tighten security on campus: 
We can secure our academic buildings, 
be watchful in our residence halls, and 
improve conditions in highly traversed 
but poorly patrolled areas on Carnegie 
Mellons outdoor property.Helping people isnt PR
Celebrities shouldnt use charitable acts to avoid bad press
Roughly the size of Pennsylvania, 
Malawi is a third-world country abun
dant in four things: AIDS, malaria, 
drought, and tobacco plants. Called only 
by her ironic first name, Madonna is an 
entertainer known for four things: conic 
boobs, scandalous music videos, devo
tion to the Kabbalah, and a lip-lock with 
Britney Spears.
Malawi used to enforce, by law, modest 
dress. Jeans on women are still generally 
considered unacceptable. Madonna used 
to tour dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix, surrounded by topless dancers. 
Once during a concert in Puerto Rico, 
she rubbed the islands flag between her 
legs on stage.
So when the Material Girl pledged 
to help the orphaned children in the 
southeast African country, we were 
incredulous.
We were even more skeptical when we 
heard that Madonnas aicl organization, 
Spirituality for Kids (a group based in the 
mystic, semi-Jewish religion Kabbalah), 
would be running the orphanage in a 
primarily Roman Catholic country.
Maybe we were wrong.
Madonna has promised to raise at least 
$3 million to fund programs that aid 
Malawian orphans, as the country is 
home to nearly one million children who 
have lost at least one parent to AIDS. Her 
orphan-care center will be built soon, 
and shes financing a roughly $1 mil
lion documentary about the plight of 
Malawian children. Shes partnered with 
other aid organizations and also met 
with former president Bill Clinton to join 
forces and try to bring low-cost medi
cines to the area.
Considering that .when she pledged 
her money Madonna had never stepped 
foot in Africa, her generosity looks an 
awful lot like publicity.
As philanthropy goes, Madonna seems 
to be jumping on the bandwagon. With 
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie being the 
poster children for starving, ailing Africa
 even choosing to have their own child 
there  Madonnas charity appears as 
though its merely following the trend. 
After all, helping African orphans is an 
easy sell. Theyre innocent, in need, and 
make for great photographs.
In the queen of pops defense, it was a
Malawian who specifically approached 
her to ask for her help. Victoria Keelan, 
the managing director of a Malawian 
agricultural-supply company, contacted 
Madonnas Spirituality for Kids foun
dation a year ago and asked for her 
help, according to Time.com. Madonna 
responded quickly, vehemently, and in 
cash.
Were all for celebrities using their for
tunes. to help the greater good. African 
assistance may be a fad, but its not a ter
rible trend to follow. Celebrities have the 
money, social influence, and PR power to 
make a significant difference.
Were curious, though, as to why its 
the once-scandalous celebs who choose 
to champion third-world countries. Jolie, 
who has modeled in the nude and fa^ 
mously wore the blood of her ex-husband 
Billy Bob Thornton around her neck, has 
a tattooed prayer for her son covering 
an old tattoo of the Chinese character 
for death.
So while we support helping ailing 
African orphans, we dont want the act to 
become the quick-fix for celebrities to get 
out of the trashier gossip columns.
The ever-changing face 
of Americas Jesus Christ
Marshall Roy
The history of American Christianity 
just closed a fascinating week. You dont 
have to look much further than the 
headlines to see that the Son of God 
must be having an identity crisis.
On September 13, 2001, in the rubble 
and the dust of the World Trade Center, 
social service worker Frank Silecchia 
discovered an intersection of steel sup
port beams roughly 18 feet tall and 
weighing about three tons. It had bro
ken in precisely the shape of a cross. For 
five years it stood over Ground Zero, 
offering an odd solace to countless 
grievers. Last week it was moved  via 
flatbed truck and crane  to St. Peters 
Roman Catholic Church, where it will 
reside until its permanent installation in 
the World Trade Center Memorial to be 
completed in 2009'.
The effect this artifact has had is 
religion at its best. It offered a sense of 
purpose to the men and women charged 
with the Herculean task of removing 
mountains of debris from downtown 
New York. It comforted and uplifted 
them, its three tons an insignificant 
weight compared to the burden of the 
workers that it helped to shoulder (giv
ing new meaning, in my mind, to the 
phrase support beam).
Somehow, in the same breath, reli
gion made itself a sinister player in the 
weeks most heartbreaking story. The 
Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, led 
by the nefarious Reverend Fred Phelps, 
planned to picket the funerals of the 
Amish schoolgirls slain on October 2 
in Nickel Mines, Pa. A representative 
of the church claimed that God was 
merely punishing the Amish for follow
ing a false religion.
Phelps and his congregation of ultra
conservative Christians gained notoriety 
by protesting at funerals for American
krieg; they are worried about retention. 
A troubling number of teenagers are 
leaving the flock, they say, giving in 
to salacious impulses fostered by MTV 
and that mainstay of teenage mentality, 
the coolness of not caring. The people 
who brought us the phenomenon of 
the megachurch  add a wicked sound 
system to a shopping mall, throw in 
the zest of worship, and you should 
have a pretty good mental picture  
are re-energizing their efforts to make 
evangelical Christianity a mainstream 
part of American popular culture.
Setting Christianity to a three-chord 
riff might get some of the broader, more 
contentious points across (save it till 
marriage, homosexuality is a no-no, 
etc.), but I wonder how well it coriveys 
the more challenging themes (loving 
thy neighbor and whatnot).
Recently, many evangelical Christians 
have adopted environmental causes, 
and thank goodness. Once upon a 
time, before falling into the inescap
able pigeonhole of hot-button issues 
like abortion and gay marriage, reli
gious activists concerned themselves 
with feeding the impoverished, securing 
peace around the world, and fighting 
for human and civil rights.
(I withdraw that last statement; the 
NSA just called to inform me that alls 
peachy in Darfur, detainees are having a 
blast at Guantanamo, and that contrary 
to popular to myth, children dont actu
ally need health insurance.)
My point in all this is that evangeli
cals should be careful employing  and 
exploiting  the same visceral, cultural 
tendencies that theyre trying to coun
ter. They cant beat MTV by imitating it. 
Christianity has a habit of latching on to 
popular customs as a propagation strat
egy; its why Christmas conveniently co
incides with old pagan solstice celebra
tions and the resurrection of Christ sup
posedly takes place in spring, when the 
Earth renews itself. (Thats no heretic 
conspiracy theory a la Dan Brown. Read 
the medieval memoirs of St. Augustine; 
hes quite frank about it.)
Setting Christianity to a three-chord riff 
might get some of the broader, more con
tentious points across (save it till marriage, 
homosexuality is a no-no, etc.), but I wonder 
how well it conveys the more challenging 
themes (loving they neighbor and whatnot).
soldiers killed overseas. They claim that 
God is punishing America for, among 
other things, tolerance of gay culture 
and feminism. These guys make Rick 
Santorum look like a granola-eating, 
tree-worshiping, bike-riding, Simone 
de Beauvoir-reading campaign manager 
for Hillary Clinton.
But in a surprising twist, the congrega
tion did not take this tragic opportunity 
to pour scorn on the Amish, one of this 
countrys most piously peaceful com
munities. Conservative talk-radio host 
Mike Gallagher offered, the Westboro 
Baptist Church an hour of national air
time in exchange for a written promise 
not to picket the funerals. The church 
accepted his offer and complied with 
its terms.
Gallagher, though he vehemently op
poses the groups message, sacrificed 
the airtime so that the Amish of Nickel 
Mines wouldnt have to grapple with ad
ditional anguish. He willingly submitted 
to a personal anathema so that the suf
fering of others might be eased.
How Christ-like.
Amid all this, evangelical Christians 
are beefing up their pop-culture blitz
The Amish have a favorite piece of 
scripture* Romans 12:2: And be not. 
conformed to this, wo rid: but be ye 
transformed by the renewing of your 
mind, that ye may prove what is that 
good, and acceptable, and perfect, will 
of God.
Evangelicals neednt go to Amish lev
els of nonconformity to this world, but 
they would be wise  and righteous
 to renew not their music or mega
churches, but their minds and hearts.
Jesus must be awfully confused. Hes 
been pulled in so many directions by 
our country that Hes like an unmoored 
teenager awash in the ocean of popu
lar culture. From New Yorks soothing 
steel cross to Topekas hateful Reverend 
Phelps to hipster evangelicals who put 
Jesus on a T-shirt and sell Him, America 
has wildly different expectations of our 
Lord and Savior. Whose imploring does 
He obey? To whose authority does He 
concede?
Well never know. Lets hope He does.

Flu shots, 
staying sane, 
and NY Times
j MM |-jnu
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
This week, we thought wed 
take a break from agenda-setting, 
paradigm-shifting, and platformshowcasing in order to highlight 
some things that arent imme
diately relevant to our agenda, 
but will be beneficial for you to 
know: flu shots, CAPS, and The 
New York Times.
The flu season is coming, and 
at Carnegie Mellon it can hit 
you particularly hard. Were ap
proaching the busier parts of the 
semester  youll have more ex
ams, term papers, projects, studio 
assignments, and recitals than 
you feel like you can handle. The 
last thing youll want is the flu. 
The flu can leave you bed-ridden, 
body-aching, feverish, and nau
seous for days on end. It kills pro
ductivity, and in an environment 
like a college campus it spreads 
extremely quickly. While the flu 
isnt completely preventable, you 
can take steps to protect yourself 
by getting a flu vaccine.
The flu vaccine will help your 
body defend itself throughout 
the flu season. Its not a fool
proof safeguard against illness, 
but its one of the most effective 
measures you can take.
Flu shots will be offered over 
the next few weeks at Health 
Services, Giant Eagle, CVS, Rite 
Aid, and UPMC Allergy Centers. 
Most clinics dont require ap
pointments. For more informa
tion, visit www.cdc.gov/flu/.
Just as your physical health will 
come under attack this semester, 
your mental and emotional health 
might suffer too. You can be pro
active in defending your mental 
and emotional well-being. Best 
of all, its free. Counseling and 
Psychological Services (CAPS) 
offers completely confidential 
counseling and support services 
to students throughout the year. 
CAPS counselors can help you 
with academic, family, friend, 
romantic, or any other type of 
personal concerns. CAPS coun
selors exist solely to support stu
dents, so take advantage of this 
free resource. CAPS is located on 
the second level of Morewood E 
Tower and its number is (412) 
268-2922. For more information, 
visit www.studentaffairs.cmu. 
ed u/co unseling/.
Carnegie Mellon participates 
in the USA Today Collegiate 
Readership Program. Through 
this program, students are not 
just offered free newspapers, but 
access to other valuable features, 
like the premium content on the 
New York Times website. Starting 
this week, promo cards are avail
able for free from the UC Info 
Desk. Each card contains a pass
word that will provide you with 
access to all premium content on 
the Times website until December 
2007. Any undergraduate student 
can pick up a card. The UC Info 
Desk is open seven days a week 
from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.

Missing the bigger picture in security
Transportation Security Administration entangles itself in regulations instead of tackling our real vulnerabilities
The path to peace and security in Iraq 
cannot be traversed in Humvees
In the October 2 edition of 
The Tartan, Patrick Pettibon 
asserted that we need more sol
diers in Iraq, an overwhelming 
occcupying force to achieve 
military victory (Peace and 
stability are the ultimate goals 
in Iraq). We have already 
spent $500 billion and many 
thousands of our soldiers have 
been killed or wounded; yet 
the latest intelligence reveals 
the result of these efforts has 
actually increased the threat of 
terrorism.
Who are the enemies we 
are going to destroy with our 
military? Are they those in Iraq
who want the United States to 
withdraw? That would mean 
destroying the majority of 
Iraqis. Or are our enemies the 
hundreds of millions of people 
around the world who hate the 
present American government 
because of its aggression and 
human rights abuses?
It should be obvious to any 
rational person that there is no 
military solution. Recognizing 
this, we should quickly remove 
our troops from Iraq.

The Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) eased the 
ban on liquids and gels on air
planes on September 26. Rejoice! 
Wheres my shampoo?
But theres always a catch: 
Youre limited to travel-size 
bottles, and all of your toiletries 
have to fit in one eight-inch Ziploc bag. Leave those comfy shoe 
inserts at home; you still cant 
take them with you.
At least the thirsty masses 
can once again bring drinks on 
planes, provided that they buy 
them from restaurants or shops 
between the security checkpoint 
and the gate  and who doesnt 
love those $3 bottles of water? 
I shouldnt mention that most 
employees at those shops are ex
empt from security screenings 
because it probably wont make 
you feel safer.
Regardless, the idea of a multi
part liquid explosive that is easy 
to mix together on an airplane 
is a bit of a fantasy in itself, the 
stuff of Die Hard or 24. Unless 
terrorists can bootleg an entire 
chemistry lab (or some gasoline) 
onto an airplane, you dont have 
to worry too much. For terror
ists, the easing of the liquid ban 
means at best they could douse 
themselves in liquid soap and 
give an air marshal the slip.
So we can add one more ac
complishment to the TSAs small 
list of triumphs: keeping airport 
convenience stores and tiny 
plastic bottle manufacturers in 
business since 2006. I feel safer 
already. This concession for toi
letries might as well have been 
delivered with a wink and a 
nudge. Oh yes, youre screwed, 
but at least you have clean hair 
and teeth.
I say that because there are 
some real threats to airlines that 
are more pressing than Fixodent 
and Dr. Scholls: missiles and 
batteries.
There are thousands of porta
ble, heat-seeking missiles on the 
black market, and its only a mat
ter of time before someone takes 
a shot at an American commer
cial airliner. There has been talk 
of outfitting planes with technol
ogy that can fool these missiles, 
but the cost is prohibitive, until 
you consider the total potential 
cost of a plane being shot out of

the sky over New Jersey.
And dont forget that if you 
have a Dell, Apple, Toshiba, 
Lenovo, Fujitsu, or IBM laptop, 
your battery might burn up and 
explode. The major battery re
calls are making headlines, but 
that doesnt mean people will 
listen or act. Where are the TSA 
warnings on that one?
Screening baggage wont pro
tect us forever. Build a better 
detector and terrorists will find 
a better way to hide a weapon. 
When the TSA catches word of 
any ridiculous plot, watch out. 
Laptops, iPods, shoes, water, 
clothes, fingernails, hair fol
licles, tooth fillings  how much 
are we willing to give up to fly to 
Los Angeles in four hours?
We are all being suckered. 
Were waiting in long lines and 
submitting ourselves to cav
ity searches for the illusion of
safety. We take off our shoes 
and tolerate broadcast requests 
for diligence and throw out our 
shampoo because weve been 
told it will keep us safe.
While airport security is not 
wholly ineffective, there are bet
ter ways. More terrorists (like 
the alleged liquid bombers) will 
be stopped through intelligence 
and investigation efforts than by 
screening luggage for shampoo.
Its one thing to protect us 
from a particular plot or tactic 
(e.g., box cutters, liquids, shoe 
bombs), but its better to iden
tify terrorists, cut their funding, 
and stop them regardless of their 
tactics and targets. People feel 
reassured by guards and impos
ing security machines, but with 
every dollar spent on regula
tions, equipment, and security 
staff, we are diverting resources 
that could be better spent track
ing down and stopping terrorists 
before they get to the airport. Or 
shopping mall. Or reservoir. Or 
football game. You get the idea.
Even more terrorists will be 
deterred if we dont make a big 
deal out of terrorism. Terrorists 
dont merely want to blow up 
airplanes; they want to disrupt 
our daily lives. Every reaction
ary TSA regulation, every media 
frenzy, every pontificating po
litical speech, every time we are 
manipulated by fear, we are  to 
use the clich  letting the ter
rorists win.
Be honest: Does anyone look 
forward to flying these days? 
When was the last time you felt 
the magic of air travel, that a 
metal tube and some jet engines 
could allow man to pierce the 
clouds and look down from the 
heavens? Can we ever recapture 
that feeling, or are we doomed to
f I refuse to eut and 
run like you guys !
have any pleasure of flight beaten 
out of us by long screening lines 
and nonsense baggage rules?
Were stuck on the idea that 
the wonder of airline travel has 
been replaced by the harsh truth 
of an uncertain and dangerous 
world. When we trade magic for 
fact, there are no tradebacks. 
We knew it couldnt last. Well 
have to change our ways of life 
forever. We lose. Oh, well, heres 
our toothpaste and our dignity.
We deserve better. The coun
try that abolished slavery and 
built the atomic bomb and de
feated communism to preserve 
the principles of liberty can do 
better than give us a sandwich 
bag of three-ounce bottles. Stand 
up and demand it.

Womens soccer falls to 0-2 in UAA play
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Rain or shine, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens soccer team 
was unable to secure a win at 
home this week. After playing 
four games away, the Tartans 
returned to Gesling Stadium 
for a Wednesday night matchup 
against Grove City College. The 
game never progressed past the 
warm-ups; rain and lightning 
postponed the game until a later 
date.
On Sunday afternoon, the Tar
tans played Washington (Mo.) 
University in sunshine and tem
peratures in the 70s, but were 
still unable to find success, fall
ing to.the Bears 3-1.
The loss to Wash. U. dropped 
the Tartans to 4-5-1 for the 
season and 0-2 in University 
Athletic Association (UAA) play. 
The Bears moved to 10-2 and 
2-0 in the UAA.
Wash. U. first-year midfielder 
Caryn Rosoff dominated the 
game, scoring all the Bears 
goals. Her first goal came in the 
10th minute of play, off an unas
sisted shot from 25 yards out that
found the left corner of the Tar
tan goal. Rosoff scored again in 
the 28th minute of the game off a 
pass from junior forward Marin 
McCarthy. The score remained 
at 2-0 heading into halftime.
Coming out of halftime we 
had nothing to lose, junior for
ward Kasey Stever said. We 
definitely acted scared our first 
half, but there was no reason to 
be. We definitely picked it up the 
second half and put our best ef
forts in.
Carnegie Mellon started the 
second half of the game off 
strong, when Stever made a long 
charge to the Bears net in the 
54th minute of play. Her shot 
had just enough momentum to 
slowly roll into the goal, cutting 
the Bears lead to 2-1.
Jess Howard played a ball 
through their defense, Stever 
said. It was a 50/50 ball between 
me and their goalie. I slid and 
just barely touched it around the 
goalie. It took about 10 minutes 
before it actually rolled in. The 
goal brought Stever to a teamhigh four goals for the season.
Rosoff crushed the Tartans 
momentum less than 10 minutes 
later when she collected a loose
ball in front of the Tartan goal 
and shot it into the left side of the 
goal past sophomore goalkeeper 
Christie Adams to score an insur
ance goal. Adams had six saves 
throughout the game.
Wash. U. took 13 shots during 
the game, compared to Carn
egie Mellons four. They played 
a different formation than most 
teams, Stever said. Three 
defense, five midfielders, two 
forwards. There was so much 
offensive 'pressure the whole 
time which was really hard to 
deal with.
The Tartans are back on the 
road next weekend for two UAA 
matchups. They face Brandeis 
University on Friday at 5 p.m. 
and New York University on Sun
day at 11 a.m.
Although Carnegie Mellon 
womens soccer is 0-2 in UAA 
play, they are not out of postsea
son contention.
Were definitely not out of 
it, Stever said. It just so hap
pens that the first two teams 
we played were among the best 
teams in our conference, not to 
mention the country. We should 
see some better results in the 
next few games.

Club Sports Roundup
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Baseball
The Carnegie Mellon baseball 
club faced West Virginia Univer
sity on Saturday, defeating the 
Mountaineers 14-4. Graduate 
student Matt Corbett pitched a 
complete game, allowing only 
five hits and one earned run.In 
the first inning, Carnegie Mellon

first six batters reached base.
In the second inning, first-year 
center fielder James Langhauser 
stole home to bring the score to
5-0. Sophomore third baseman 
Aaron Hernley led off the third 
inning with a triple to deep left 
field, then came in to score on 
sophomore first baseman Ben 
Chidesters RBI single. In the 
fourth, sophomore catcher Brian 
Tabata and junior left fielder 
Chris Manganello hit back-toback triples to add to the Tartan 
lead.
Sophomore Brett Rehfelds 
RBI double and Corbetts RBI 
ground-out added two more 
runs to Carnegie Mellons total

SPORTS COMMENTARY
For Haynesworth, suspension isnt enough
Adam Greenberg
$40,391. Apparently that sum 
isnt enough to buy a few hours of 
good behavior each week. Thats 
Albert Haynesworths per-game 
salary for 2006.
Haynesworth, a fifth-year de
fensive tackle for the Tennessee 
Titans, inexplicably stepped on 
Dallas Cowboy Andre Gurode
 specifically on Gurodes head 
after Haynesworth had already 
kicked his helmet off  last 
Sunday after a Cowboy touch
down. Gurode required multiple 
stitches for cuts on his face.
Haynesworth attempted to 
apologize after the game, say
ing, What I did out there was 
disgusting. It doesnt matter 
what the league does to me.
The league should take him 
up on his apparent offer. The 
games referee had already 
ejected Haynesworth, but the 
real penalty came last Mon
day when the NFL suspended 
Haynesworth for five games 
without pay  the longest ever 
for an in-game incident.
It started a buzz on both sides. 
Some commentators claim that 
the leagues actions are arbi
trary, targeting Haynesworth 
over other players involved in 
criminal activity over the past 
few months that the league has 
been reluctant to deal with. 
Others note that five games isnt 
sufficient punishment for such a
dangerous attack.
Haynesworths outburst is not 
unprecedented. In college he left 
practice after an argument with 
tackle Will Ofenheusle only to 
return with a pole and intent 
to attack his teammate. The 
University of Tennessee coach 
fortunately stopped Haynes
worth before he attacked the 
other player.
In 2003, Haynesworth 
kicked another teammate dur
ing a Titans practice. And in 
May, charges of road rage were 
dropped in one Tennessee 
county and dismissed for want 
of jurisdiction in another. After 
all that, one starts to wonder 
how sincere his disgust with 
himself could really be.
Any suspension is certainly 
a welcome sight for those who 
think professional athletes 
should be role models as part 
of the unwritten contract with 
fans that really earns them the 
big bucks. Even a quasi-violent 
event like professional football 
demands some civility from its 
rather well-paid players.
But the punishment is hardly 
proportional to the offense. Lets 
get a few things straight about 
Haynesworth: His actions po
tentially constitute both a crime 
and a tort.
The state of Tennessee pe
nalizes assault with a deadly 
weapon  Haynesworth was 
wearing metal cleats because of 
the grass field at Tennessees LP
Field  as aggravated assault. 
Its a felony that could put him in 
prison for three to six years.
The tort may end up being 
more interesting legally. In 1973, 
Denver Bronco Charles Clark 
struck a blow to the back of Cin
cinnati Bengal Dale Hackbarts 
head. The ensuing lawsuit set a 
precedent: that the battlefield 
conditions of football consti
tute no implied consent for such 
egregious behavior. Basically, as 
long as the NFL prohibits inten
tionally stepping on opposing 
players heads  it did the last 
time I checked  Haynesworth 
cannot hide behind footballs in
herently dangerous nature.
The state puts aggravated as
sailants behind bars for years; 
it lets the injured recover mon
etarily to compensate them for 
their losses. The NFL, on the 
other hand, gives a five-week 
vacation to a man who might 
still otherwise make almost half 
a million dollars this year from 
its coffers.
If the league is waiting for 
a better player to make an ex
ample of, they may have some 
time to wait. Unlike other NFL 
player incidents, from substance 
abuse to the bizarre Minnesota 
Vikings sex cruise incident, this 
one happened during a game. It 
defamed the NFLs core product. 
And it happened in front of hun
dreds of thousands of fans.
The only parallel event in re
cent memory is the 2004 brawl
between the Detroit Pistons 
and Indiana Pacers basketball 
teams, arguably worse because 
of the inclusion of several unfor
tunately intrepid Detroit fans. 
The result? Criminal assault 
charges for five Pacers players 
and an 86-game suspension for 
Ron Artest, the worst of the of
fenders  the remainder of the 
year and the longest suspension 
for an on-court incident in that 
leagues history. Despite involv
ing fans, those events were at 
least partially provoked and yet 
Artest was out for the season.
The National Football League
 and indeed also the Play
ers Association  is missing a 
key opportunity to put its foot 
down and state in no uncertain 
terms This type of person is 
not welcome in our organiza
tion. Instead, their interests in 
preserving the integrity of the 
game and in physically protect
ing their players on the field 
fall by the wayside with a mere 
month-long suspension.
Titans head coach Jeff Fisher 
has intimated that Haynesworth 
may not be welcome back even 
after his league-mandated sus
pension has run. Management 
would be wise to listen.

ington University in St. Louis.
Stop blaming coaches for teamsfailures
Doug Fricker
Fans are spectators for a rea
son, yet they arent content with 
just watching their favorite 
teams. Oh no, they feel the need 
to control and be a part of their 
teams management. Did your 
team lose last week? Guess you 
should create a website demand
ing that the coach be fired. Not 
liking the way your team is play
ing? Print T-shirts calling for the 
front office to be fired, or pay 
money to fly banners over the 
stadium during a game demand
ing change.
One of the toughest and most 
scrutinized jobs these days in 
sports is that of head coach. 
Coaches werent always under 
a microscope, but expectations 
of a coach in this day and age 
are changing. Fans are becom
ing less and less patient and are 
refusing to wait til next year 
or stay quiet and give the guy 
a chance. Its wrong that for 
todays coaches all of a sudden 
their previous success means 
nothing, and one or two wrong 
moves or tough breaks is all it 
takes to get the axe, the heaveho, the pink slip.
Larry Coker, the head coach 
of the University of Miami Hur
ricanes football team, is walk
ing a tightrope currently, with 
the Hurricanes losing two of 
their first three games and 
barely defeating a mid-major 
team, a team not from one of 
the six main conferences, at the 
University of Houston, 14-13, to 
improve to 2-2.
Coker started 23-0 at Mi
ami, yet you wouldnt know it
from what Miami fans are say
ing these days. Fans of these 
big-name programs have shorter 
memories than amnesia victims. 
Fans at Miami take football very 
seriously and the institution has 
seen tremendous success in the 
recent past, having played for 10 
national championships in the 
past 23 years and having won 
five.
During the game against 
Houston, some fans showed 
their anger with Coker by tak
ing to the skies. Three different 
messages calling for the firing of 
Coker and athletic director Paul 
Dee were flown over the sta
dium. Numerous websites, such 
as www.cokermustgo.com and 
www.firecoker.com, have been 
created bashing Coker and demandinghe be fired. The opening 
statement on cokermustgo.com 
says, Larry Coker has made 
UM stand for University of Me
diocrity. The statement goes 
on to say, Coker is killing our 
program one year at a time. Hes 
killing the attitudes of our play
ers, the same attitude that has 
built UM into the dynasty that it 
is (was).
It must be the world we live 
in. Good people arent given the 
opportunity to right the ship 
that started sinking due mostly 
to reasons out of their control. 
Dusty Baker, the now ex-man
ager of the Chicago Cubs, 
managed his team to a NationalLeague-worst 65-97 this season. 
On paper, not renewing his con
tract makes sense except for the 
fact that a significant amount of 
the Cubs payroll was on the dis
abled list.
Of the Cubs five pitchers in
the starting rotation on open
ing day, only two were available 
at the end. This doesnt include 
Kerry Wood and Mark Prior, the 
two pitchers who led the team 
to the National League Cham
pionship Series (NLCS) in 2003
 Bakers first year as the Cubs 
manager.
Derrek Lee, the Chicago Cubs 
all-star first baseman, was in
jured in late April and missed 
the majority of the season. His 
injury deeply affected the Cubs 
team, as they were above .500 
prior to the injury and unspeak
ably worse after.
Baker is a three-time Man
ager of the Year, and its not as 
if someones ability to manage 
just vanishes into thin air. The 
Cubs will be hard pressed to find 
someone of his caliber as his re
placement. Im disappointed to 
see him go without having an
other chance to start a season 
with a full team.
Coaches these days know 
what theyre getting themselves 
into when they take a coaching 
position at these institutions, 
but its not fair for them to have 
to take the blame for what often
times are things they cant do 
anything about.
The players are saying they 
are the ones at fault and not 
their coaches. This is the truth 
too. Managers and coaches 
arent playing the games; theyre 
standing on the sidelines or in 
the dugout. In this game and 
in sports, period, when a team 
plays bad, they start at the top, 
Cubs outfielder Jacque Jones 
said. Maybe some of us should 
be fired or released, but its sad 
that the manager, the coaches,
the [general managers], the 
presidents  its sad that those 
guys have to go.
The majority of these coaches, 
Baker and Coker included, have 
done so much for their respec
tive sports that goes unnoticed. 
There are two messages com
ing out; its not right, Florida 
State head football coach Bobby 
Bowden said. One of them is, 
Coach, get all our boys gradu
ated. Coach, keep your kids 
out of trouble, make them go 
to class, and, oh, Coach, if you 
dont win, youre fired. 
[Cokers] kids are getting 
graduated down there, behav
ing themselves pretty good. But 
thats the way our profession is 
right now.
Baker was in a similar boat 
when Cubs general manager 
Jim Hendry said, I tried to 
factor everything in and make 
the decision I thought was best 
for the Cubs at this particular 
time. In no way, shape, or form 
is that a slight of Dusty cant do 
this, Dusty cant do that, and 
somebody else can do it better. 
I felt it was just time to make a 
change.
Baker has realized first-hand, 
and Coker might find out soon, 
how focused everyone today is 
on winning now. When things 
go the slightest bit downhill, 
talk of firing the coach starts up, 
and it distracts the team and de
tracts their focus from their next 
game.
Unless todays coaches can 
come to terms with this and 
somehow ignore or thrive under 
the constant criticism, theyd 
better not get too comfortable in 
their current position.
Mens cross country wins meet; women place thirdGolf team nabs top finish
by Sam Kim
Junior Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the mens and 
womens cross country teams 
raced at the Dickinson Invita
tional at Dickinson College in 
Carlisle, Pa.
The mens team outraced the 
other Division II and III schools to 
win the overall team title with 51 
points. The mens team also won 
the 8K team title with 31 points 
and finished second in the 4K 
race with 20 points. The womens 
team also had an impressive day, 
finishing third out of 21 teams in 
the 4K race.
Mens cross country
Sophomore Brian Harvey con
tinued his remarkable season 
with a first-place overall finish in 
the 4K race. In his first collegiate 
win, Harvey finished the race 
with a time of 12:20.42.
After my 8K, I had a great time 
watching Brian Harvey destroy 
the field in the 4K, said sopho
Si
more Ryan Anderson. Then to 
win two team awards wasnt too 
rough either.
Behind Harvey, sophomore 
Breck Fresen finished second for 
the team and sixth overall with 
a time of 12:32.51. First-year 
Dario Donatelli and sophomore
They suprised 
me by running so 
well. 
- Dario Donatelli
Andrew Frederickson finished 
13th and 33rd overall with times 
of 12:41.43 and 13:07.29, respec
tively.
I didnt know what to expect 
for the 4K, said head coach 
Dario Donatelli. They surprised 
me by running so well.
In the 8K race, senior captain 
Geoff Misek led the team and 
finished sixth overall with a time 
of 26:53.99. All season we had
V
been waiting for Geoff to have 
his break-out race and today was 
definitely the day, Harvey said.
First-year Sean Hamilton and 
junior Jason Jura finished sec
ond and third for the team with 
times of 27:08.30 and 27:16.19, 
respectively. Both finished the 
race with personal best times.
Sophomores Mike Haley and 
Ryan Anderson finished fourth 
and fifth on the team with times 
of27:22.13 and 27:24.83, respec
tively. First-year Chris Rizzo and 
junior Mark Tressler rounded 
out the top seven as they fin
ished with times of 27:39.36 and 
27:44.43. Haley and Rizzo also 
had personal best times for the 
race.
[The top runners] really 
stepped up, Donatelli said. 
Theyre starting to make their 
move.
The mens cross country team 
returns home for the Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational on Saturday 
at Schenley Park. The invitation 
will feature 25 schools from all 
three divisions and Carnegie Mel
lon mens and womens alumni
teams. The race is expected to 
start at noon.
Womens cross country
In the 4K race, first-year Hallie 
Espel led the team again by fin
ishing 14th overall with a time 
of 15:52.52. Sophomore Carolyn 
Clayton and first-year Danielle 
Sedlack finished second and 
third for the team with times of 
15:56.84 and 15:58.27, respec
tively.
Senior Jerri Castello finished 
fourth for the team with a time of 
16:12.93. Junior Carrie Kmetzo 
and senior captain Stefani Penn 
finished fifth and sixth for the 
team with times of 16:26.23 and 
16:27.57. First-year Anna Lenhart 
finished with a time of 16:46.16 
to round out the top seven.
Overall I think everyone had 
a solid performance. Most of us 
had never run a 4K before, but 
we definitely paced each other 
well, Kmetzo said.
The womens team will join the 
mens team at the Carnegie Mel
lon Invitational on Saturday.
GOLF, from A16
Lee fired three birdies on the 
day, including a memorable shot 
that paved the way for his first 
collegiate title.
On my 17th hole, on the parfive, I hit a three-quarter threewood from like 245 [yards] and 
I hit the green in two, put it to 
like 10 feet for eagle. I missed 
the eagle putt but I made birdie.
I guess that won me the tourna
ment because Timmons was just 
one behind me.
Lees presence on this years 
squad only adds firepower to a 
Tartan team that headed into 
last seasons University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Champion
ship tournament neck-and-neck 
with eventual UAA champion 
Rochester for the regions final 
post-season spot.
Chris is a solid player, said 
head coach Rich Erdelyi. He 
has got a great golf rsum. He 
has played in some really big 
tournaments in California and 
all over the country so he is a 
tournament-proven player.
Not only did Timmons and 
Lee fire two of the top scores, but 
Smith parlayed three birdies into 
a tie for fourth place with a 76. 
Junior Blake Darby rounded out 
the Tartans 308 by carding an 
83 while three other members 
of the team  sophomore Josh 
Chen and first-years Adam Klein 
and Brett Cannaday competed 
as independents.
Carnegie Mellon will look to 
ride this early-season momen
tum at the Bearcat Invitational 
today, held at Totteridge in 
Greensburg, Pa. Although the 
critical part of the teams season 
begins in the spring, success in 
this shortened fall season will go 
a long way.
Its almost like a dual season. 
We play six rounds in the fall and
11 or 12 rounds in the spring. 
Erdelyi said. Right now were 
just trying to get ourselves in 
position to hopefully be looked 
at and be ranked by the national 
committee, and if we can con
tinue to shoot somewhere be
tween 300 and 305, 306, 308, I 
think well do that.

9 October 2006 THE TARTAN Ai6
Carnegie Mellon mens soccer team takes back-to-back victories
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team wrapped up another
undefeated week of soccer by de
feating the Point Park Pioneers 
and the Washington (Mo.) Uni
versity Bears at Gesling Stadium.
The Tartans won both games 
1-0, with senior forward Jona
than Browne scoring the gamewinning goal in both matches. 
Carnegie Mellon is now 9-2 on 
the season and 2-0 in University 
Athletic Association (UAA) play, 
having beaten the University
of Chicago two weeks ago and 
Washington University this Sun
day.
Washington University came 
into the game with a 6-2-1 re
cord, hungry for their first UAA
victory. The two sides battled to 
a scoreless first half with neither 
team getting many scoring op
portunities.
We were pleased with the 
way we played in the first half; 
we didnt want to change that 
much, assistant coach Matt 
Crummy said. We tried to work 
on some different tactical things, 
some possible formations and 
where we wanted to attack from. 
We were playing a tough oppo
nent and we mainly wanted to 
keep up the intensity.
In the 55th minute, stand
ing in front of the back left post, 
Browne one-timed a shot into the 
net off a header from first-year 
midfielder Ryan Browne. The 
play started on sophomore mid
fielder Dan Brackleys throw-in 
from the right sideline. Brack
leys throw met Ryan Brownes 
head in the right side of the 18- 
yard box, with his header finding 
Jonathan Browne. It was a per
fect flick through, and I just got 
on the other end of it and put it in 
the goal, Jonathan Browne said.
The Tartans made their onegoal lead stand, thanks to strong 
defense and sophomore goalie 
Matthew Bazin. After we scored
we started looking at a couple 
options, especially so that they 
couldnt exploit us, attacking 
from the wings, said Crummy. 
I thought we did ,a pretty good 
job once we got things settled 
down. [Washington University] 
was pressing a lot to try and get a 
goal, but we did a good job keep
ing them out of the net.
We feel like we need to win 
every conference game, said 
Jonathan Browne. This win was 
huge, especially with a couple 
other teams in the UAA losing. 
Were in the drivers seat now, so 
we needed to take advantage of 
this game and we did. Everyonq 
gave 110 percent today, and this 
is what we needed to do and we 
got the win.
Against Point Park on Tuesday, 
Jonathon Browne scored in the 
23rd minute when he received a 
pass from senior midfielder Sean 
Filipovitz and shot it past Pio
neers goalkeeper Steve Fabian. 
Filipovitzs cross came from the 
left end line directly to Browne, 
who one-timed the pass to the 
right of the keeper.

Mens and womens tennis 
teams competed away from 
Carnegie Mellon this week. Two 
Tartan men found success in 
Salisbury, Md., while the women 
fell in California, Pa., 8-1.
Mens tennis
A pair of first-years led the 
Carnegie Mellon mens tennis 
team last Monday, the final day 
of the Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociation (ITA) Atlantic South 
Regional Mens Tennis Champi
onships.
Nikola Ljuboja and James Mu
liawan won the doubles regional 
championship by defeating Alex 
Buxbaum and Thomas Kinrade of Haverford College 8-6. 
Ljubolja and Muliawan fell be
hind 6-4 before reeling off four 
straight games to win the cham
pionship.
We were down 6-4 when 
our coaches told us to return 
more down the line because the 
other team was leaving it open, 
Ljubolja said. We then took 
control of the net and won four 
straight games easily.
Muliawan also made the sin
gles final, but was defeated by 
John James of Mary Washington 
University 6-4, 6-4. First-year 
Jon Spero also made it to the
final day, but lost a semifinal 
match to David Maldow of Johns 
Hopkins University 6-1, 6-3.
Ljubolja and Muliawan will 
next travel to the ITA National 
Small College Championships at 
Florida Gulf Coast University in 
Fort Myers on Thursday.
Womens Tennis
The womens tennis team 
traveled to California Univer
sity of Pennsylvania on Tuesday 
to take on the Vulcans in a dual 
matchup. The Tartans fell to the 
Division II Vulcans 8-1, moving 
the Tartans to 1-1 in dual com
petition.
Senior Mai Otsuka captured 
the Tartans only win in the 
number-six singles match against

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
volleyball team played its 
final regular-season home 
games this past weekend as it 
hosted the six-team Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational in Wiegand 
Gymnasium in the University 
Center. The Tartans won all 
three matches over the two-day 
tournament to improve their 
record to 12-9 on the season.
On Friday, the Tartans opened 
against Medaille College and 
lost the first game 30-32, but 
rebounded, winning the next 
three 30-14, 30-17, and 30-19, 
and the match.
Senior right side hitter Catie 
Fisher and junior outside hitter 
Kate Stepp led the way in kills 
in the four-game victory with 
12 and 10, respectively. Senior 
setter Brea Carlock added 31 
assists to the match, and senior 
libero Kat Fox collected 22 digs 
to lead the defense.
The Tartans followed their 
victory over Medaille with a 3-0 
victory over Penn State-Altoona 
by scores of 30-14, 31-29, and 
30-16. Fisher had 12 kills to lead 
the Tartans against the Lions, 
and Carlock totaled 30 assists. 
Senior middle blocker Malena 
Yablinsky had four blocks and 
four block assists during the 
match.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
battled Elizabethtown College 
and needed all five games for
their come-from-behind victory. 
The Tartans won the first game 
30-21, and then dropped games 
two and three by the scores of 
30-19 and 30-21. They were 
successfully able to regroup and 
win game four 30-22 and then 
take the deciding fifth game 
15-8.
Senior outside hitter Amanda 
Bradford was instrumental in the 
Tartan comeback as she racked up 
12 kills, 15 digs, and four blocks 
in the victory. Carlock tallied
28 assists, and first-yea^ setter 
Samantha Carter dished out 21 
assists of her own. Fisher led the 
Tartans with 14 kills, and senior 
middle hitter Becky Metier and 
junior middle hitter Abbie Toney 
each finished with 10 kills.
After struggling early in the 
season, the Tartans are coming 
together and playing solid 
volleyball. I think now that a lot 
of the season is under our belt, 
were learning how to fight back 
and win the five-game matches,
said head coach Kim Kelly. We 
won a five-game match against 
Rochester last week; we were 
down 2-0 against them and we 
fought back. Now were at that 
maturity level in the season 
when were thinking, This isnt 
over, we can win this. 
At the end of the match 
against Elizabethtown we had 
more juice than Sunny Delight, 
Toney said. We really brought it

Carnegie Mellon mens 
tennis doubles team of firstyears James Muliawan and 
Nikola Ljuboja won the Wilson/ 
ITA Atlantic South Regional 
Tournament last Monday.
The pair was honored by the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) and jointly named UAA 
athletes of the week. Muliawan 
has lost only one match all 
season, when he was defeated 
in the ITA singles semifinals. 
Wednesday, Muliawan heads 
to Florida to compete in NCAA 
competition, but first he met 
with The Tartan to discuss his 
success on the court.
Tartan: How did you get into 
tennis, and when did you start 
playing?
Muliawan: I learned to play 
because my dad always played, 
and I started playing when I 
was about 12. Playing clubs and 
USTA tournaments, and then I 
played on my high school team.
T: Did you always plan on 
playing tennis in college? What 
made you want to play at 
Carnegie Mellon?
M: I always knew I wanted 
to play in college because its 
something I love. I was really 
excited to come play here because 
I love having the opportunity to 
help build a team. The teams 
doing better than it ever has
before, we have a lot of really 
strong underclassmen, and I am 
proud to be a part of it.
T: How supportive has your 
family been throughout your 
career?
M: They have been
tremendously supportive. They 
have really helped out, getting 
me to tournaments and paying 
for USTA tournaments. Every 
weekend, they would take 
me to the airport, I would get 
on a plane and go play in a 
tournament, and depending 
on if I played well or not, they 
might be back at the airport to 
pick me up the next morning.
T: So, do you have any pre
match rituals, any lucky charms, 
or superstitions before you get 
out on the court?
M: I am a little paranoid, I 
always do the same stretches, 
I have to do them in the same 
order every time, and I always 
listen to the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers before a match.
T: We have all watched tennis 
on TV or seen an actual match. 
What do you really miss out on
\
when you are just watching the 
sport?
M: It is really hard to 
understand how hard it is to 
play for that long. We have 
matches that will last three or 
four hours, and when we are at a 
tournament we will play all day 
long. It gets really exhausting.
T: When you are playing for 
that long, what do you focus on 
so you stay in the game?
M: I mainly just try to focus 
on myself, what I am doing, 
things I can do or should do, 
how I can try and control the 
game. I cannot think about my 
opponent, because really I do 
not have control over how they 
play, I just have to worry about 
how I am playing.
T: The fall tennis season is 
winding down, but you start 
up again in the spring; any 
particular goals in mind for the 
spring season?
M: A big goal would definitely 
be to win UAAs as a team. We 
would have to take out Emory, 
but it would be tremendous. 
That is something I would really 
like for us to try and do.

Golf builds on last years 
success, wins invitational
by Adam Lazarus
Staffwriter
After a fifth-place finish in its 
fall season-opener back in late 
September, the Carnegie Mellon 
varsity golf team appears to be 
picking up right where it left off 
last season.
A 308 score at the Westmin
ster Invitational last Monday at 
New Castle Country Club in New 
Wilmington, Pa., gave Carnegie 
Mellon a four-stroke victory and 
re-established the Tartans abil
ity to outshoot anyone in the 
field.
I think were a pretty deep 
[team], junior Howard Smith 
said. Other teams in our region 
have one really good player and 
then they sort of fall off. I think 
our strength is although we 
dont have that dominant player,
I think anyone can shoot well on 
any day.
During the 2005-06 season, 
the Tartans posted eight topthree finishes as they flirted 
with a first-ever appearance in 
the Division III postseason tour
nament.
Despite the loss of two key 
seniors from last years squad,
several returning golfers proved 
last week that they too can post 
low scores.
Sophomore Alex Timmons 
shot a three-over 75 on a difficult 
course that featured fast greens 
and some tricky pin placements.
Although they did put the 
pins in tough spots, I feel that 
they were a challenge, which is 
always welcome, said Timmons, 
who sunk two birdies on his af
ternoon. The course, other than 
them being just a little wet, was 
in great condition.
Despite being three over par, 
Timmons (and Westminsters 
Nick Marzo) outscored all but 
one golfer in a 10-team field that 
included Division II Clarion Uni
versity. Fellow Tartan Chris Lee, 
a first-year, bested Timmons and 
Marzo by one stroke and took 
home the individual champion
ship in just his second collegiate 
tournament.
I knew all I had to do was 
stay within myself and just not 
try and do anything too special, 
Lee said. I was just trying to put 
together a solid round, being a 
freshman, just trying to contrib
ute to the team.

Homecoming highlights; events you wont want to miss
by Shaleya Solomon
Layout Staff
Campus tours, Buggy history, chili, and 
school spirit! Whats not to love? This 
weekend, Carnegie Mellon is honored to 
welcome back its alumni for another fun-filled 
and educational Homecoming weekend. With 
a multitude of events and activities, everyone 
will surely be able to keep busy and enjoy the 
festivities. Its almost as good as Carnival! 
There are activities for everyone from 
students, to faculty, to alumni, to families.
Becoming reacquainted with your 
surroundings
All weekend, alumni and family can take 
specified walking tours of the campus, 
buildings, departments, or surrounding 
areas. One such tour, Everything New Since
You Were Here, aims to point out all the new 
developments, innovations, and things that 
have changed since alumni attended Carnegie 
Mellon.
Awards
A major event is Carnegie Mellons longstandingtraditionofrecognizingcontributions 
from not only alumni but also faculty and 
students. The Alumni Awards Ceremony 
honors outstanding individuals in two areas: 
service and achievement. The service award is 
given to alumni who have contributed greatly 
to Carnegie Mellon through alumni volunteer 
programs, chapter volunteer programs, and 
more. The achievement award is for those 
who have contributed to the world at large.
Kevin Wesley, the assistant vice-president 
for university advancement and deputy 
director of Alumni Relations, said that the 
achievement award is meant to reflect
the spectrum of human accomplishment. 
This year, the Alumni Awards Ceremony 
will recognize a physicist, an inventor, an 
engineer, and a novelist, to name a few, and 
additionally two faculty members and two 
students who have given a great deal to the 
university.
Centennial
Three centennials will be celebrated this 
year. The first is the centennial of the first 
class of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
College, which will include a tea party and 
the dedication of the Maggie Murph Cafe. 
The Department of Mechanical Engineering 
will also celebrate its centennial. There will 
be a panel discussion and a lunch from 12:30 
to 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, in the Singleton 
Room in Roberts Engineering Hall. Thirdly, 
The Tartan will celebrate its centennial with 
an open house in which visitors can come
meet the staff and see the workings of the 
newspaper. In addition, a panel discussion, 
featuring the papers publisher, Bradford L. 
Yankiver, will take place from 2 to 3 p.m. in 
the Dowd Room in the University Center.
According to Wesley, the overall goal of 
Homecoming weekend is the interaction 
of the campus and its current students and 
alumni. We very much want the campus 
community and alumni community to come 
together in a learning environment.
The panels weve put together showcase 
faculty, staff, students, and returning alumni 
from all corners of campus he said. The 
Office of Alumni Relations worked diligently 
on making this ideal come true. This year, a 
25-person undergraduate student staff was 
hired to be greeters, help with staff events, 
decorate rooms, and various other activities. 
This was all in the hopes of creating more 
student involvement, resulting in the students

A network of tunnels burrows through Carnegie Tech
m
by Gene Anderson
Staffwriter
Published February 21,1956
If any Tech man is thinking of 
invading Morewood Gardens via
the Tech heating system tunnels, 
he had better give up the idea 
unless hes prepared to do a large 
amount of digging. There just 
arent any tunnels leading into 
Morewood from any spot on the 
campus.
Have you ever won
dered why the air above 
the vent across the street 
from Engineering Hall is 
so warm?
Have you ever noticed 
that the snow is always 
melting on the sidewalk 
in front of EH? The an
swers to these questions 
lie in Carnegie Techs 
heating system.
Techs central heating 
plant is located in Ma
chinery Hall on the west 
end of the campus.
A walk-thru tunnel 
connects this plant with 
the Gym and Margaret 
Morrison. Within this 
tunnel there are pipes 
carrying steam at pres
sures of 50 and 100 pounds per 
square inch, a hot-water pipe, and 
condensate ducts.
The 100-pound pipe branches 
off into EH where the pressure is 
reduced.
It then continues on to head 
towards the Faculty Club and the 
Coal Research Lab.
The 50-pound duct leads 
straight under Fine Arts where it 
branches off into two directions.
One branch goes directly into 
Skibo and SIA, while the other 
continues ahead until it branches 
into the Gym and MMCC.
The MMCC branch divides into 
two sections, one of which heats 
the grad dorms and the houses 
on Forbes Sb and the other heats 
Donner Hall, the mens dorms, 
and the houses along the west of 
Margaret Morrison St.
There are condensate tanks lo
cated at four spots on campus 
where water collects to be re
turned to Machinery Hall. A hotwater pipe in the tunnel serves 
AH, FA, EH, and MMCC.
Electrical System
The schools electrical system 
follows much the same pattern 
as the heating system. It was 
installed in 1950 at a cost of 
$200,000. The system converts 
a 22,000-volt current into us
able AC and DC sources and 
outlets.
Extensions of the power sys
tem have been proposed to cross 
the Cut and enter Morewood 
Gardens. It is estimated that 
school electricity could save at 
least $4000 per year in power 
company bills, but whether or 
not this would offset the cost of 
construction is another matter.
Mr. Keck, the superintendent 
of heating and maintenance, 
whose office is below Porter 
Hall, says that the problem of 
supplying and power in ade
quate quantities to the school 
is a never-ending one. As dif
ficulties arise, solutions must 
be worked out quickly and ef
ficiently.

New computation center
Author Unknown
Published March 21,1956
A computation center, new 
all-institutional teaching and re
search facility, will be opened at 
Carnegie Tech on September 1, 
1956, it was announced Friday. 
Dr. Alan J. Perlis of Purdue Uni
versity has been named to direct 
its operation.
Essentially a huge mathemati
cal processing machine, the 
center will greatly increase the 
rapidity of providing numerical 
answers to research and develop
ment problems by adding, sub
tracting, multiplying, and divid
ing almost instantaneously. The 
center will consist of an IBM-type 
Model-2 Magnetic Drum Data 
processing machine and many 
items of punched card accessory 
equipment.
Complex problems are broken 
into smaller parts and fed into 
the machine on coded punched 
cards. Numerical answers emerge 
with amazing speed, sparing sci
entists from the drudgery of com
putation and allowing them to 
apply more of their time to actual 
research.
Of City-wide Value
In addition to supplying comk
putational service to Carnegie 
Tech, industry, and the govern
ment, the center will be used 
as a tool for researching further 
theories of machine computa
tion, and educating students in 
its mathematics, techniques and 
future possibilities.
The computation center at 
Carnegie Tech is made possible 
by the IBM educational contribu
tion program. It will be located in 
the Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration and run by a staff 
headed by Dr. Perlis, president 
head of the Computing Labora
tory at Purdue University.
Computation Research
Dr. Perlis, who received his 
B.A. in chemistry from Carnegie 
in 1942, will also serve as an 
associate professor in the math
ematics department. He is widely 
recognized as a computer expert 
for his work at Purdue and has 
published many papers on the 
subject. He holds M.S. and Ph.D. 
degrees from Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology.
In keeping with Carnegie Tech 
tradition, the Center will seek to 
disseminate as widely as possible 
all progress in computational 
techniques originating with Dr. 
Perlis, his staff and other Carn
egie researchers.

Higher education. The pur
pose of any academic institu
tion is to prepare its students for 
life outside its walls. Casting off 
caps and gowns, graduates are 
expected to break out of their 
four-year learning environment 
in the pursuit of a livelihood. 
But what if they return? Below 
are the stories of three Carnegie 
Mellon alumni who have found 
employment  and nostalgia
 right here on campus.
Life in plaid
Class of 71 alumna Mary 
Burcin, who returned to cam
pus in 1997, enjoys the campus 
environment, inside and out. 
Burcin currently works as the 
serials processing associate in 
the acquisitions department of 
the University Libraries.
It has a diverse population, 
she said, speaking of the stu
dent body. Burcin also noted 
that Carnegie Mellon has a way 
of introducing you to students 
you never would have met: from 
across the globe or from Squirrel 
Hill. She also admires the layout 
of Carnegie Mellon: Our cam
pus is unified, said Burcin.
Burcin has the honor of being 
the first female Carnegie Mellon 
student to enroll in the ROTC 
(Reserve Officers Training 
Corps) program. Inspired by the 
tension over Vietnam, Burcins 
participation laid the ground
work for a female presence. I 
wanted to know what my friends 
who were soldiers were going 
through, she said. Anybody 
wearing a uniform was not ap
preciated on campus.
Another success story from 
students who return here to 
work can be found with Conrad 
Zapanta. Zapanta, a 91 gradu
ate, took advantage of the varied 
academic offerings at Carnegie 
Mellon. Now a professor, he 
graduated from CIT with a dual 
degree in mechanical engineer
ing and biomedical engineer
ing under his belt, not to men
tion quite a few music courses. 
Music was just a fun part of 
being here, said Zapanta, who 
admits that he was often the 
token engineer during his days 
in the choir.
Zapanta was heavily involved 
in extracurricular activities 
during his time at Carnegie 
Mellon. Your educations not 
just in the classroom, he said. 
Zapanta was a Head Orientation 
Counselor, a member of the 
Asian Student Association, and 
part of a church fellowship, to 
name a few of his activities. 
Perhaps most importantly, he 
pushed buggy. It was during 
the preparation for this sacred 
Carnegie Mellon competition 
that Zapanta met his wife, the 
driver-whom he pushed.
Susan Cribbs, another alum
na, now works in internal com
munications and news services 
on campus. Cribbs received a
B.A. in English and professional 
writing in 2000, followed by an 
M.A. in professional writing in 
2006. Though she grew up about 
35 miles outside of the Burgh, 
Cribbs knew little of the city 
when she arrived as a first-year 
in the fall of 96. We had been 
to Pirate games and things like 
that, she said, but Squirrel Hill 
and Oakland were largely new 
environments. So was Carnegie 
Mellon: I was pleasantly sur
prised, said Cribbs. It looked 
like a campus.
One of Cribbs most memo
rable experiences throughout 
her time as a Carnegie Mellon 
undergraduate was the shooting 
of Wonderboys, a 2000 film star
ring Michael Douglas, Robert 
Downey Jr., and Tobey Maguire.
That was a really exciting expe
rience, said Cribbs. Though the 
movie was shot in April, its script 
called for a winter climate, and 
so the necessary measures were 
taken around campus: Fake 
snow was dispersed and trees
Burcin, whose youngest son is 
college-aged, added that she 
feels proud of every Carnegie 
Mellon student. Burcin said, I 
know what it took to go here. 
Originally a member of the Class 
of 70, Burcin had to delay her

Donner and Baker Hall served 
as the main two locations for

the UC for three hours in order 
to reserve tickets to the premiere

could work and take classes at 
the same time.
During her time away from 
Carnegie Mellon, Burcin taught 
art within the Pittsburgh pub
lic school system and preschool 
classes. I knew that I always 
wanted to come back and work, 
she said. Working as a part of the 
University Libraries turned out 
to be the perfect opportunity.

Published September 27,1955
Dr. John W. Graham, Dean of 
Students, announced Wednes
day the awarding of a contract 
covering the construction of the 
first of a proposed five new fra
ternity housing units. George W. 
Chilli, who built Donner Hall, 
submitted the low bid and will 
begin construction as soon as 
possible.
Plans call for a unit of two 
distrinct L-shaped houses joined 
under one roof. It will be located 
on the corner of Forbes Street 
and Devon Road, where the for
mer DU house is already being 
razed. Moving-in day is sched
uled for September 1956. The 
Betas and DUs will occupy the 
first group. A second unit, to be 
located at the corner of Forbes 
Street and Morewood Avenue, 
is the administrations next ob
jective.
The new housing plan is the 
result of months of planning 
and preparation. After many 
conferences with fraternity ad
visors, faculty, administration 
and fraternity alumni and un
dergraduate members, Techs 
trustees approved the design of 
architect Lawrence Wolfe, Tech 
class of 1944.
Individuality is Keynote
A fraternity man himself, 
Wolfe planned to me,et the de
mands of space and ground 
limitations most effectively, 
while maintainting low cost 
and most important, preserving 
individuality within each unit. 
A solid wall between each pair 
of houses will ensure corporate 
entity. Only the basic structures 
are alike. Individual fraternities 
can choose their own front and 
rear court designs and brick pat
terns.
Each house, with approxi
mately 110,100 cu. ft., is de
signed to sleep 36 men. In addi
tion there will be flexible dining 
facilities to meet all fraternity 
needs. On the first floor will 
be lounge, dining, trophy and

Returning to Carnegie Mellon 
has taught Burcin as much about 
the institution itself as it has 
about its students. It gives you 
a different perspective of what 
goes on in the university when 
youre staff, she said. Burcin is 
learning the work that goes into

likely to take for granted, par
ticularly those provided by her

Before starting work this year 
at Carnegie Mellon, Zapanta 
taught at several other institu
tions, taking a break in Texas 
for a non-academic occupation 
developing heart valves. Of pro
fessors, Zapanta pointed out, 
Not a lot of us have had jobs 
on the other side. His job in 
Texas helped to put his work in 
the classroom into perspective. 
Zapanta added that professors 
often see their students as MiniMes, though in reality most of 
them are not destined for aca
demia.
Zapanta is passionate about 
teaching, but loathes writing 
grants, a process central in the 
workdays of many college pro
fessors. It was during what he 
calls a bad grant-writing day 
at Penn State that Zapanta first 
decided to apply to work at 
Carnegie Mellon.
My only redeeming quality 
was that I went there, he joked, 
but nevertheless he was hired. 
Zapanta now has a teaching 
position with research opportu
nities and absolutely no grants 
required.
Having been one himself, 
Zapanta feels he can relate well 
to the students. Theyre used 
to doing the impossible within 
a finite amount of time, he ex
plained. Though he never ex
pected it, Zapanta is embracing 
his return to the university. Its 
good to be back, he said. The 
novelty hasnt worn off.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 9, 2006
Abolish the Draft: the solution lies with incentive for enlistmentftIPl
by James Panepinto
Staffwriter
Published January 12,1966
Whenever vigorous dissent 
concerning the current draft 
system is expressed, the dissenters 
are usually labeled as being 
unpatriotic or un-American. In 
the past months, demonstrations 
have occurred which indicate that 
many people feel the American 
way consists of supporting 
government institutions or 
policies, apparently without 
regard for their value to society 
as a whole.
From the viewpoint of society 
as a whole, the draft clearly 
causes vast economic waste. First, 
it forces many highly trained and 
competent individuals to spend 
two years performing duties that
could be done by less well-trained 
personnel. If the military were 
operated with volunteers, the 
social waste of assigning college 
graduates or individuals with 
comparable skills to jobs below 
their level could be avoided.
To encourage enlistments, a 
significant increase in salaries is 
necessary. The starting recruit 
now earns $87.90 per month
 less than many people on 
welfare receive. A $200 to $300 
per man increase would make 
salaries competitive with civilian 
employment. The cost of this 
would be extremely high  close 
to $9 billion for the size of our 
current armed forces. However, it 
is reasonable to assume that many 
men would re-enlist if salaries 
were increased, and this would 
reduce the net cost of the proposal. 
Presently, only about five percent
of draftees re-enlist, and the cost 
of basic training ($3387) must be 
absorbed for each new recruit.
The draft is also highly 
discriminatory and by no means 
does it provide for universal 
military service. Only three 
out of ten men from nineteen to 
twenty-six serve in the armed 
forces. Key or essential personnel 
of corporations may be granted 
deferments, and the remaining 
portion are physically, mentally, 
or morally disqualified. Most of 
the men who serve come from 
lower income groups, since the 
majority of student and critical 
skills determents are usually 
from middle and higher income 
persons.
The greatest inequity of all 
is the refusal to recruit women 
for the services in the same 
manner as men are recruited.
It is apparent that women are 
necessary for efficient functioning 
of the services. They, however, are 
provided enough inducements 
to fill the quota. If the selective 
service act is considered logically, 
then why not draft women also to 
fill quotas  or why not provide 
the necessary inducements to 
attract men?
In spite of all these inequities, 
and despite the social waste as a 
result of the draft, dissent is often 
scheduled because the draft is 
viewed by most Americans as a 
necessary American institution. 
However, the draft is no longer 
necessary. The United States 
doesnt need a war-time army and 
the number necessary may very 
well be provided for if salaries 
reach a reasonable level.
Above all the points I have 
mentioned lies one distressing
fact. General Hershey, head of 
Selective Service, has been 
quoted as prescribing the draft 
as a cure for juvenile delinquency 
as well as a means of handling 
demonstrations. In Michigan, a 
group of college students who 
sat down in a draft office as a 
means of protesting the Vietnam 
war were declared to be draft 
delinquents and were reclassified 
I-A. General Hershey reports that 
he hasnt had any trouble with 
Vietniks since.
All over the country, state 
legislators are threatening to cut 
the budgets of state supported 
institutions whose students have 
been protesting the draft or 
Vietnam. A democratic society is 
clearly in danger when officials of 
the government have the power 
to punish or destroy those who 
oppose its policies.
I.M. Offers New Options; Double Majors Instituted
Author unknown
Published February 9,1966
A number of changes in the Carnegie Tech 
curriculum will go into effect in September 
1966. These will include new options in 
the Department of Industrial Management 
(to be renamed the Department of 
Administration and Management) and 
double majors for students who wish to 
study mathematics and physics.
In addition to the present industrial 
management courses, this years freshmen 
in engineering and science will be 
permitted to select a minimum of five 
courses from an optional field.
The present program will be continued 
as the Industrial Management option, to 
psychology, computer science, economics, 
English, literature, history, and writing.
The I.M.* option will include, and the 
new options will exclude, the following 
courses; second year physics, elements of 
mechanical engineering LA, and electrical 
engineering. Together with the free 
elective now available in the junior year, 
this will make room for five semester 
courses in the new optional fields. 
Programs which cross option lines will be 
permitted, upon special request.
According to Dr. Myron L. Joseph, 
department head, when advanced 
analytical management techniques first 
evolved they were used primarily in 
production and manufacturing. Largely as 
a result of this the management program 
was tightly matched with engineering. 
Over the years analytical management has 
spread to other sectors of the economy 
(finance, organization planning, banking, 
advertising and distribution) as a result 
balances other than engineering are 
reasonable.
More Liberal Education
Says E.R. Schatz, vice president 
of academic affairs: It is felt that the 
changes will attract superior students 
with analytical ability and an interest in 
management science, but who are not 
necessarily interested in an engineering 
background.
In Dr. Josephs opinion: The program
hope that education at Carnegie Tech will 
move further in the same direction.
The departments name was changed 
in view of the curriculum changes. It was 
felt that the title of Industrial Management 
was too narrow.
As concluded by members of the 
department, the GSIA faculty and the 
Academic Affairs Committee: The
phrase management science is well
It is felt that the changes will attract 
superior students with analytical ability 
and an interest in management science, 
but who are not necessarily interested in 
an engineering background.
E.R. Schatz
will permit undergraduate students 
to make further use of the resources of 
Carnegie Tech than is possible at the 
present time, will provide more flexibility 
to meet the needs of individual students 
and will stimulate increased faculty 
interest in undergraduate education.... It 
will provide a more liberal education.
I like the kind of education that the 
new program represents, he says, and
known and has an accepted connotation 
in the business world. Use of the word 
administration indicates that the curricula 
of the department is not restricted, but is 
adapted to train students in the broader 
aspects of modern administration.
Double Majors
Double major programs will lead to
bachelor of science degrees in mathematics 
and English or history, and physics and 
English or history.
Of the forty semester courses comprising 
the total four years of study there are 
twelve courses required in the science 
major and no more than ten courses in the 
humanities major. Thus, approximately 
half the program is devoted to related 
areas, distribution subjects, and free 
electives.
Of the twenty semester courses 
comprising the last two years for the 
physics-English program, only nine are 
devoted to specific required courses while 
eleven may be chosen by the student 
within prescribed limitations. The math 
programs permit more freedom of choice 
for the student.
The total number of completely free 
electives is very small, however, namely, 
two in physics and four in math.

'i
Tech to survey fraternities to ensure 
they comply with Civil Rights Bill
by Candy Etkiin 
& Liz Seley
Staffwriters
Published September 23,1965
In late July a statement was 
issued by the commissioner 
of education stating that to 
comply with the Civil Rights 
Law of 1964 universities and 
colleges receiving federal aid 
and maintaining fraternity and 
sorority systems as part of their 
program must be sure that no 
discrimination because of race, 
creed or national origin exists.
A new Education Bill, not yet 
approved however, contradicts 
the Civil Rights Law by stating 
that there shall be no intrusion 
in the selection of members for 
social fraternities or sororities. 
The bill has now gone back to
committee for the inclusion of 
a rider which will stipulate that 
only those houses unowned by 
the institution or are off-campus 
will be affected by the Education 
Bill.
If the Education Bill is not 
passed, steps will have to be taken 
t to enforce the Civil Rights Bill.
A survey regarding 
discriminatory practices on the 
Carnegie Tech campus will be 
taken by the administration 
so that they in turn can assure 
the federal government that 
Carnegie Techs fraternity and 
sorority systems are operating in 
compliance with the law.
President Stever will most 
likely be required to sign a 
statement which will discuss any 
discriminatory practices and the 
administration efforts to alter 
them.

Junior Staffwriter
An enigma plagues the stu
dents of Carnegie Mellon 
University. Upon commence
ment, the question looms: What 
now?
Several Carnegie Mellon 
alumni have answered that< 
question. The university has pro
duced Nobel laureates, Academy 
Award winners, and business ty
coons. A select few times a year 
alumni come back to the school. 
Homecoming weekend is one of 
them.
In high school, Homecoming 
is idealized as a time to dance, 
attend pep rallies, and root for 
your team. Carnegie Mellon may 
not have a dance, the pep rallies 
may not be well attended, and 
our football team may not be 
on campus over Homecoming 
weekend, but this is a time to 
take advantage of our alumni. 
They can help us build our fu
tures.
Networking means a lot of 
things. For some, it means find
ing connections through family 
friends. For another 17 percent 
or so, networking is made easier 
because of Greek life. But other 
students at Carnegie Mellon 
may find networking a mystery. 
Those people can turn to the ser
vices available at the school.
For instance, the university 
is offering career-based pan
els throughout Homecoming 
weekend, including a panel 
called Life Long Networking. 
Martin Black, director of Career 
Services, said, [The seminar] 
is bringing in older alumni 
who are highly successful in 
verbal [communication].... 
They will be walking up and 
down the aisles engaging peo
ple.
The Alumni House works
hard to build strong connections 
between students and alumni. 
Students make connections 
when alumni come to campus 
and sometimes score high-paying 
jobs. However, the alumni doing 
the hiring get benefits too.
The alumni of this school 
tend to have a high respect for 
the faculty, for the curriculum, 
so they feel very comfortable 
talking to their students about 
their own company as a poten
tial career destination, said 
Black. Alumni can trust that the 
people they hire from Carnegie 
Mellon have had educational 
experiences similar to their 
own, and that those new hires 
have had to live up to similar 
expectations to achieve their 
degrees.
Homecoming weekend will 
also include a seminar titled 
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Here, stu
dents can get a close look at 
very young alums. We lead in 
with a workshop with people 
they may even recognize from 
the previous year, Black said, 
explaining that students might 
see the alums and think: She 
walked down the hall; shes now 
working for the Federal Reserve; 
shes an alum and she can talk 
about how she went from be
ing a student from being gain
fully employed/ Its all still very 
fresh.... Theres very little that 
distinguishes her from the stu
dents, making alumni very real 
to the students.
Students arent just limited 
to alumni from this univer
sity, either. Carnegie Mellons 
Reciprocal Services, a program 
run through the Career Center 
website, allows students from 
other colleges to access our stu
dents. Thus, when undergradu
ates try to get in touch with 
alumni, they are not just lim
ited to Carnegie Mellon gradu
ates; they have a whole world of
aMff s 'I
mm
alumni open to them.
Alumni House, as well as the 
Career Resource Center in the 
UCs basement, allow alumni 
to meet students one-on-one; 
both centers have time set aside 
for alumni to return and pres
ent career-related information. 
Susan Timko, a career consul
tant for H&SS majors, said that 
some ways networking are: 
Through workshops, including. 
the familiar Tech Sunday and 
H&SS Sophomore Symposium. 
Other opportunities also help 
encourage alumni relations. 
Alumni utilize our on-campus 
recruitment system to interview 
students for full-time and intern
ship opportunities in their orga
nizations, said Timko.
The Career Center is not just 
for full-time job searches. Its 
databases allow alumni to ad
vertise internship opportunities 
and summer jobs for students 
to investigate. Alumni who have 
students start working for them 
over a summer can build a re
lationship that later advances 
their companies. The network
ing that results from the alumni 
reunion has in the past led to 
jobs; its led to internships; its 
led to full time jobs; its led to 
relationships where the alum 
becomes the alumni mentor, 
Black said.
Networking with alumni as 
well as other professionals is one 
of the most effective methods 
for finding internships and full
time employment, said Timko. 
Carnegie Mellon offers many 
opportunities for students to con
nect with alumni. Specifically, 
throughout the year there will 
be a variety of Network Night 
events across the United States 
that are designed for this pur
pose, The Career Center will be 
alerting students of these op
portunities, plus many more 
throughout the year.

mii͡ɧ, pflf|jV |A lot can change in a year. 
Consider all of the changes the 
campus has seen in just the last 
few months: the installation of 
Jonathan Borofskys public art 
piece, Walking to the Sky; the 
addition of Maggie Murph Caf 
in Hunt Library; the demolition 
of the West Campus in prepa
ration for the Gates Center for 
Computer Science. Think of how 
much more can change in 25 
years.
During this years Homecom
ing celebration, Campus Design 
and Facility Development will 
lead an Everything New Since 
You Were Here tour, planned 
specifically to highlight the nu
merous and varied changes that 
have taken place since the class 
of 1971s graduation.
For their 25th class reunion, 
the former students who 
shopped for textbooks in a tiny 
basement store in Baker Hall 
will now explore the University 
Center where Skibo Hall once 
stood. They will get to step into 
the outdoor room created by 
the 1990 east campus project -- 
West Wing, Resnik, a horizon
tally oriented football field, and 
the University Center (built sev
eral years later in 1996), which 
were built to replace what was 
once a relatively empty space.
Over the course of 
Homecoming weekend, four 
one-hour tours will depart from 
the patio at the front of Warner 
Hall, just as those for prospec
tive students do. However,
these tours will not focus on 
student life and the anecdotes 
attached to many of the build
ings it features. Rather, alumni 
will be treated to an overview 
of how the overall composition 
of campus has changed and to 
the smaller structures that have 
been added. The many pieces 
of outdoor art recently placed 
on campus will be highlighted, 
and the tour will provide alumni 
the opportunity to see the larger 
modifications.
Leading the plans for the walk 
through campus and personally 
directing a few of the tours is 
Peg Hart, senior project manager 
for Campus Design and Facility 
Development. Also an alumna 
of the architecture program, she 
began her studies at Carnegie 
Mellon in 1969.
Now, having been an employee 
of Carnegie Mellon for the past
12 years, she is well qualified to 
reacquaint the alumni with the 
campus.
[Now, it is] a more urban 
campus. There is a sense of 
place, that youre somewhere 
special. Youre not just wander
ing around, but youre in an or
ganized, cohesive space, said 
Hart, noting that the histori
cal section created by architect 
Henry Hornbostel similar to how 
it was in the early 1900s.
Despite the sweeping changes 
that have transformed the face 
of much of this campus, Hart 
said that certain aspects remain 
identical since she was here as a 
student. Many even evoke a nos
talgic sentiment. Some things, 
especially in the College of Fine 
Arts, are the same for me. The
stairwells in that building look 
exactly the same, even smell ex
actly the same now as they did 
then.
Bob Reppe, director of design 
for Campus Design and Facility 
Development, will also help lead 
these tours with an eye to what 
he believes are many exciting 
changes that have taken place 
recently, both externally and in
doors.
I think [the tour] will in
trigue people.... What will be on 
peoples minds that doesnt have 
to do with the landscape envi
ronment is whats in between 
buildings, he said. I am look
ing forward to pointing out the 
things that have improved the 
quality of life here on campus.
The recent additions to 
Carnegie Mellon may seem rela
tively small in comparison to 
the large structural modifica
tions that have moved and trans
formed the shape and center 
of the campus since the 1970s; 
however, these changes are 
highly significant to the future 
of the university.
Though it may not be possible 
for alumni to see or be aware 
of everything that is different, 
like the new turf on the stadium 
field, or the multi-million dol
lar renovations in the fraternity 
quad, they will have the chance 
to view much of whats new sim
ply by taking a look around.
For those returning after hav
ing been gone many years, it 
may appear that much has been 
altered, but as Hart explains, 
All the important things are still 
here.File Photo

After they stole the portrait of Andrew Carnegie from Baker Hall, the unknown culprits painted the Fence with a poem that poked fun at Security.
Andrew Carnegies picture stolen from Baker Hall, security foiled
By Elly Zimmerman
Staffwriter
Published November 4,1975
Andrew Carnegie had a great 
fall is the least that can be said 
regarding a suspicious chain of 
events that started last Monday. 
Early that morning, students no
ticed a portrait of Andrew Carn
egie was missing from the second 
floor of Baker Hall. The portrait
was valued at approximately five 
hundred dollars. Security was 
not notified until 6:00 that eve
ning.
The sequence of events which 
occurred before the theft include 
two personal ads which appeared 
in The Tartan on October 14th 
and October 21st.
According to Editor in Chief, 
Gary Singer, The personals 
were received anonymously at 
The Tartan office with full pay
ment. In the October 14th issue 
the personal stated, To The Tar
tan, The Found will disappear. 
Signed The Head.
The October 21st issue had 
another personal which read To 
The Tartan, The Founder will 
disappear. One of his attributes 
will shrink and I dont mean the 
endowment. Signed The Head. 
The picture did not disappear 
just as the personals suggested 
but along with this, a postcard
of Andrew Carnegie was substi
tuted for it on the wall outside 
the English Department Office.
The day after the theft, the 
senior fence on campus had the 
following poem painted on it: 
Andy Carnegie hung on a wall, 
Andy Carnegie had a great fall, 
All of security and all the green 
men, Couldnt find Andy to hang 
him again!
This rhyme explains the plight 
of Security. Last Tuesday, Mike
Corletti, Director of Campus Se
curity, commented that nothing 
was being done about the theft 
because they had not yet re
ceived a formal complaint; they 
had merely observed that the 
painting was missing.
He continued to say that he 
expected the picture would be 
returned within a few days. As 
of this writing, on November 
2nd, there is still no sign of the 
painting.
Pres. Cyert foils a robbery
by Elly Zimmerman
Staffwriter
Published December 9,1975
Walking up five flights of 
stairs to his office every day 
enabled President Cyert to foil 
an attempted robbery last Mon
day night.
Dr. and Mrs. Cyert were 
attending CMUs opening bas
ketball game against St. Vincent
on Monday. After the game, at 
approximately 10:30 p.m., the 
President and his wife left the 
gym and began walking to their 
car, which was parked on Frew 
Street.
Neither Mrs. Cyert, who had 
her purse under her arm, nor 
Dr. Cyert noticed the two young 
black males walking behind
them.
Suddenly one of the young 
men hit Mrs. Cyerts purse out 
from under her arm. My purse! 
Mrs. Cyert screamed. The scream 
caught her husbands attention.
Dr. Cyert said, I heard sort 
of a popping sound when the 
purse was hit, and turned to see 
the purse fling in the air. Imme
diately the purse was grabbed 
by the young man and the two 
men began running down Frew 
Street toward Hunt 
Library. Dr. Cyert 
reacted by pursu
ing his assailants.
As the President 
and the assailants 
began to pass Baker 
Hall, Dr. Cyert ran 
in to get securitys 
assistance. After 
informing security 
of the incident he 
went back outside 
only to find that 
the young men had 
changed direc
tions. The pursuit 
began again. Final
ly, one of the young 
men threw the 
purse at President 
Cyert.
By this time 
security had 
entered the picture. Eventu
ally the thieves disappeared into 
Panther Hollow.
Had the terrain been differ
ent we would have apprehended 
them, Mike Corletti, Director of 
Campus Security, stated.
President Cyert commented, 
I was impressed that I was able 
to keep up with them.
Hunt withholds publication of Focus
by Kevin Turcotte
Staffwriter
Published January 13,1976
Due to the presence of Newsweek reporters on 
campus, the December 4,1975, issue of the Focus 
was withheld from distribution by Patrick Hunt, 
Director of Public Relations. The publication 
contained an article titled: Functional Illiteracy 
in CIT and cited examples of poor writing from 
papers by upperclassmen.
As a result of this action, a motion was passed in 
the December 11 Faculty Senate meeting barring 
prior restraint or censorship of any campus 
publication by any functionary on this campus. 
David Demerest, editor of Focus, had not been 
consulted by Hunt prior to or during the four day 
withholding.
When he did find out about the delay, Demerest 
commented, I was very disturbed, thats why I 
took the issue to the [Focus] committee and to the 
[Faculty] Senate.
As Hunt explained it, he was very concerned 
about possible negative publicity for the 
University.
It could have been picked up nationally and 
could have presented the University as a group of 
engineers and business students who have trouble 
communicating.
Hunt also added, C-MU is a very good school, 
very well respected by educators, but a lot of 
people dont know a hell of a lot about it. The 
outside world has a lower esteem of Carnegie than 
the academic world does.
What it was, Hunt said, was a case of being 
overprotective. Admittedly, one doesnt want a 
graduate to have a hard time getting a job because 
the employer remembers a story about C-MU 
students not being able to communicate. Its not 
the faculty or the administrator whos going to get 
hurt, its the graduate in June. The school image 
really helps or hurts the graduate when hes out. 
Its a tough time in June.
Hunt did not regard his actions as a form of 
censorship, I dont see it as a freedom of the press 
issue.
Associate professor Tom Kerr, head of AMS 
department commented, The first amendment 
of the U.S. Constitution provides that no 
governmental agency may censor or place 
any prior restraint on publication. C-MU is 
not a governmental agency, therefore the first 
amendment doesnt apply.
I personally believe, and I think the 
administration of this University also believes, 
that we should practice first amendment principles 
even though technically they dont apply to us. 
Hunt claimed full responsibility for the incident 
and said, It was a unilateral decision.
He also added that he never read the Focus prior 
to publication except this time, when an unnamed 
source pointed out the article and mentioned that 
the Newsweek reporters might see it. When asked 
for further details of this source, Hunt rjeplied, It 
was a person, not in Warner Hall.
Patrick Hunt stopped publication of the Focus due to 
the presence of Newsweek reporters on campus.

The mass production of brilliant minds 
and personalities is Carnegie Mellons 
speciality. Homecoming is all about get
ting students to interact with alumni and 
gain a better understanding of the legacy 
that has been laid before them; one way 
to help do this is to reflect on some of the 
great men and women who have walked 
the halls in the past. Among the universi
tys prestigious alumni are:
Notable achievers from Carnegies 
halls
John L. Hall received his B.S. in 1956, 
M.S. in 1958, and his Ph.D. in 1961, all 
from the Mellon College of Science. In 
2005, he was awarded the Nobel Prize 
in Physics for his work in precision spec
troscopy.
Yoshiaki Fujimori, class of 81, is the 
president and CEO of General Electric 
Asia. Andy Bechtolsheim, class of 76, 
is the co-founder of Sun Microsystems. 
Steven Bochco, class of 66, is  10-time 
Emmy Award-winner and the writer and 
producer of LA. Law, NYPD Blue, and Hill 
Street Blues. Stephanie Kwolek, Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College class of 46, 
invented Kevlar, a lightweight but in
credibly stiff material that is used for 
body armor, industrial cables, and brake 
lines. David A. Coulter, class of 71, was a 
former vice chairman of both JP Morgan 
Chase and Bank of America, and also 
engineered the largest financial merger 
of all time: the m$rge of Nations Bank 
Corp. and Bank of America Corp. in 1998. 
John Nash  who many know from the 
movie A Beautiful Mind  graduated 
from Carnegie Mellon in 1948. Nash was 
awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 
1994 for his work on game theory.
Innovation in computer science
Aside from its hundreds of gifted 
alumni, Carnegie Mellon also pioneered 
the computer science field. 2006 marks 
the 50th anniversary of computer sci
ence at Carnegie Mellon. In 1956, the 
Universitys first computer, an IBM 650, 
was brought into the basement of the 
GSIA building. Allen Newell  who 
earned his Ph.D from Carnegie in 57
 and Herbert A. Simon established the 
study of artificial intelligence, developing 
a thinking machine in 1956.
They worked with other colleagues 
to develop the Information Processing 
Language, which was then used to help 
spawn several early artificial intelligence 
programs, such as the computer chess 
program NSS. In 1975, Newell and Simon
were awarded the Turing Award for their 
contributions to the study of artificial in
telligence, human cognition, and list pro
cessing. Simon also went on to win the 
Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978, for his 
work challenging the economic theory of 
corporate decision-making..
In 1965, the first computer science 
department was established with Allen J. 
Perlis as its head. Perlis, of the CIT class of 
43, actually received the first ever Turing 
Award in 1966 for his work as a member 
of the team that developed the ALGOL 
programming language.
Networking for all
Another major development was the 
Andrew Project in 1985. This was a joint 
collaboration between IBM and Carnegie 
Mellon that developed a way for the en
tire campus to be networked, wired, and 
ready for privately-owned computers. 
At the time, few students could afford 
their own computers, and henceforth, 
the school decided to create the clusters 
that we have today. Software such as the 
Andrew File System and the Andrew 
webmail client were also developed. 
Carnegie Mellon was the first campus to 
make this technology readily available for 
all of its students. In addition, in 2000, 
Carnegie Mellon was the first university 
to go completely wireless.
As times change, Carnegie MeHon will 
continue to be a leader in technological 
innovation. The new Gates building will 
facilitate the advancement of computer 
science and related technologies, con
tinuing the legacy of Newell and Simon. 
Also, Carnegie Mellon will continue to 
move forward in other fields and disci
plines as well. The emphasis on quality of 
education is evident in its faculty, staff, 
students, and alumni, and these individu
als will go on to forever revolutionize the 
world in all fields and disciplines.

CMU acquires 
new building
Author unknown

Published September 24,1985
Carnegie Mellon University 
will have outright possession of 
the U.S. Bureau of Mines com
plex on Sept. 30, 1985 at a cost 
of $5.8 million.
This step marks the kind of 
outward expansion not seen 
since the early 70s when Skibo 
and Wean Hall were built.
CMU has been trying to ac
quire the USBOM buildings
This step marks

since the early 70s.
ever since President Warner 
proposed the plan back in 1957. 
It took twenty years of fighting 
with the help of Senators and 
CMU officials to have authori
zation passed for the purchase 
of the U.S. Government prop
erty.
As the USBOM is a part of the 
Interior of the Government, all 
negotiations had to go through 
Congress. In the early part of 
1981, the property was pur
chased with the agreement that 
the USBOM be moved late in 
1985.
The only problem with the 
plan is that the buildings are 
not in very good shape. Fred 
Rogers, Vice President of Busi
ness Affairs said, There is a 
lot of work needed since they 
havent been extremely well 
maintained. The U.S. Govern
ment is exempt frofn building 
codes and inspections so their 
buildings are not as well kept 
as those on our campus. That 
will be changed. He continued 
by saying that, ...there is not 
even a centralized fire alarm. 
They have hand held horns that 
are supposed to alert the entire 
building of a fire....
The added work necessary to 
bring the buildings up to stan
dards will be greatly offset by 
their usefulness and necessity 
for the campus community. Out 
of the six major buildings, CMU 
will be using all but one and a 
half. One organization associ
ated with the USBOM, the Mine 
Safety and Health Administra
tion (MSHA), will be leasing 
the remaining buildings space 
from CMU. This will help to off
set the cost of the complex.
The space opened by this ac
quisition will mostly be utilized 
in two areas. The first will be 
basic Administrative purposes, 
such as printing, Physical Plant, 
grounds keepers and some of
fices. The other major move will 
be SUPA. The extra space in 
Margaret Morrison, Porter Hall 
and other academic buildings 
on campus will ...make CMU 
the best it can be for its stu
dents, according to Rogers.

the closed doors of Doherty Hall 
and the Mellon Institute to find 
whats new in science at the 
university. :
Amid constant innovation in 
green chemistry and biotech
nology, MCS holds to its mantra 
that strength rests in numbers. 
The school encourages collabo
ration among students and fac
ulty in intellectual and commer
cial pursuits of science,
MCS dean Richard D. 
McCullough said, The power 
of a group is much more power
ful than the power of an indi
vidual.
McCullough said that while 
other universities typically 
stress research as a solo effort, 
Carnegie Mellon professors 
work together on projects.
If you go to other universiprised mainly of CMU Peace 
Alliance members, had begun

[The SEI] is just another small 
step in that process. CMU should 
be resisting that process.
ties ... you just dont get that 
collaboration, he said. Thats 
where we can win.
Computational biology and 
biotechnology
McCullough said that MCS 
is a leader in computational 
biology and biotechnology. 
Computational biology is a spe
cialized type of data analysis in 
which experts use computers to 
search for data patterns in bio
medical data.
This technology can enable 
scientists better understand the 
structure of DNA, RNA, and 
proteins. McCullough said that 
computers can help to deter
mine the identity of a protein 
that is expressed in a cancer 
cell.
Now, were at the point 
where were really seen as one 
of the strong computational bi
ology programs in the country, 
said McCullough.
Research projects include ge
netic analysis and the model
ing of brain tumors and neuron 
paths.
According to McCullough, 
this program is interdisciplin
ary in its use of computers. In 
particular, statistical algorithms 
from computers can be used to 
analyze data patterns.
CMU named a writing leader
by Drue Miller
Staffwriter
Published February 4,1986
Carnegie Mellon, in con
juncture with the University of 
California (Berkeley), has been 
named the National Center for 
the Study of Writing by the Na
tional Institute of Education. 
The five year, $4 million grant, 
funded by the Department of Ed
ucation, was awarded on the ba
sis of a joint proposal by the two 
schools, as well as Carnegie Mel
lons reputation for outstanding 
programs in cognitive psychol
ogy and rhetoric (techniques of 
effective writing and speaking).
Research of writing is a rela
tively young but rapidly grow
ing field. Linda Flowers, project 
administrator, calls the Center 
tfie first major commitment 
the DOE has made to writing. 
Co-directors Flowers and John 
R. Hayes plan to study 
writing as a cognitive 
(thinking) process.
A main objective of 
the study is to determine 
the different ways in 
which people approach 
writing tasks. Close at
tention will be paid to 
the methods used in or
ganization procedures, 
time allotments, infor
mation searching, and 
the goals writers set for 
themselves and their 
writings.
Berkeley will look at 
the circumstances and 
situations surround
ing the writer and the 
task. These two angles
fall under the general aim of 
the study: writing as a cogni
tive process within social con
text. Berkeley will concentrate 
more on children in grades K-12, 
whereas Carnegie Mellon will be 
researching at the college level. 
Directors both centers are plan
ning a lot of interaction between 
the two, especially in the form of 
information sharing.
The Center will present its 
findings to educators as teach
able learning tools.
By being sensitive to realworld problems in writing and 
research implementation, teach
ers may be able to speed the 
learning of cognitive writing 
strategies.
The Research-to-Teaching 
Seminars program offers trav
eling seminars on a variety of 
topics, including applications of 
the Centers findings to teaching, 
and anticipating the needs of an 
audience.
We leverage off the strength 
of the School of Computer 
Science, McCullough said.
Green chemistry
In addition to biology, MCS is 
expanding its expertise in green 
chemistry.
Green chemistry is the devel
opment of chemical processes 
that reduce the presence of 
harmful chemicals in the en
vironment. It applies to such 
developments as solar energy 
and chemicals that clean the 
environment.
Carnegie Mellons Institute 
for Green Oxidation Chemistry 
is a research and education cen
ter that is focused on sustain
ability science.
The center researches renew
able energy technologies, such 
as solar power, as well as al
ternatives to fossilized carbon 
energy sources.
McCullough said that green 
chemistry has also become a 
commercial endeavor for MCS. 
According to McCullough, a 
new company is currently be
ing formed based on Carnegie 
Mellons advancements in green 
chemistry.
The companies can be 
spun out from CMU, said 
McCullough.
Nanotechnology
Advancements in green chem
istry also stem from the field of 
nanotechnology, the develop
ment of micro-scale technology 
that can be used to analyze and 
manipulate samples of atoms.
Nanotechnology is deeply in
terdisciplinary as well.
Joint expertise in biology, 
robotics, and mathematics pro
vides researchers with the op
portunity to improve computer 
storage, build structures to sup
port a diseased heart, and de
velop sensors that detect chemi
cal levels in the body.
McCullough is currently in
volved in a project that requires 
the use of nanotechnology to 
construct nanowires. Nanowires 
are organic materials that can 
be used in solar cells in solar 
technology.
In addition to developing 
nanowires, Carnegie Mellons 
Center to Study and Design a 
New Generation of Technologies 
is a joint effort by MCS and 
College of Engineering to ad
vance nanoresearch in sensing, 
technology storage, and energy 
generation.
McCullough said that MCS 
maintains an interdisciplinary 
and collaborative approach to 
research.

Retail stores, swimming pools, 
game rooms, dining areas. You 
name it and youll find it in the 
new, as-yet-unnamed university 
center. The massive 240,000- 
square-foot building will house 
everything that was in Skibo as 
well as the contents of the present 
Student Center.
University Architect Paul 
Tellers said the building is slated 
for completion in the fall of 1996, 
with occupants being able to 
move in on August 1,1996.
The project is a week and a half 
ahead of schedule and has not 
hit any major problems since the 
beginning. When it opens, it will 
still have 40,000 square feet of 
unfinished basement for future 
use.
Sneak peak at buildings 
contents
Murphy provided a detailed 
description of what the building 
was to look like.
The loggia  the long stick of 
the building that runs alongside 
the Cut  will house a two-story 
retail area that will be home to an 
expanded bookstore, art store,
and Entropy. During daylight 
hours, the retail space will be one 
large area, connected by open 
stairwells. At night, the bookstore 
will be sealed off by a rolling 
gate.
WRCTs new studios will be 
located at the west end of the 
loggia in the basement.
Continuing down the stick, 
you have the chapel, some ATM 
machines, offices for Student 
Activities, an information desk, 
and then an exhibition room, 
said Murphy. On the far south 
end is the quiet study area, now 
called the Alumni room, which 
will have miscellaneous items 
from the past in there.
Scotland Yard, a series of 
dining and meeting rooms, the 
Presidents Dining Room, and 
the Faculty Dining Room will be 
housed on the second floor.
The entire third floor is made 
up of student organization offices. 
There will also be a game room 
and room for vending machines.
In the main part of the building 
is the auditorium, which seats 
450 people, and the racquetball 
courts and gymnasium. Opposite 
the gym are the diving and lap 
pools. The dining facilities on the 
first floor open onto courtyard, 
the big, horseshoe-shaped area 
facing the tennis courts.
New network at Carnegie 
Mellon  no wires attached
by Kenton Shaver
Staffwriter 
October 2 1995
You may have heard what the 
next big thing is in networking. 
Thanks to Computing Services 
personnel, Andrew is keeping 
pace with the wireless revolu
tion.
Technical Director John Leong, 
Operation Director Chuck Bartel, 
and Head of Data Communica
tions Pete Bronder are among
those who are hard at work en
abling the Andrew System to 
interface with wireless clients. I 
was lucky enough to speak with 
Dr. Alex Hills, Vice Provost for 
Computing Services, the leader of 
Wireless Andrew Project.
I asked him to explain the ori
gin of the project.
[The following are excerpts 
from the 1995 interview  Ed.]
Dr. Hills: The Information Net
working Institute, with which Im 
associated, started the initiative. 
We have a number of research 
projects going on that involve 
wireless and we needed a wire
less system to use to test our work 
 a research infrastructure you 
might say.
The research is aimed at building software that will allow a mo
bile computer to seamlessly switch 
between wireless networks.
In order to support this work I 
wrote a proposal to the National 
Science Foundation to encourage 
building a wireless infrastruc
ture on our campus. That was in 
March 1994, and the proposal 
was funded beginning in Septem
ber 1994.
Dr. Hills: There are a num
ber of wireless research projects 
 all of which will use the infra
structure in one way 
or another. We origi
nally proposed to put 
the wireless units in 
just a few places on 
campus, but when we 
started investigating 
mmmumm available equipment, 
we found that we 
could get a lot more 
coverage than we 
originally thought.
That was when we 
started to think about 
providing a service to 
the campus commu
nity.
Beginning in the 
1994-95 school year, 
we did lots of investi
gations of equipment 
and selected a prod
uct to be installed on the campus.
The installation started in June 
1995 and we now have equipment 
installed in a few buildings, but 
its not tested yet.
We plan to spend this fall test
ing what weve installed and, 
if things are working properly, 
sometime this school year invite 
researchers and others who are 
willing to put up with possibly 
unreliable service, to begin to use 
the system.
We will tell everyone, though, 
that this is just research infra
structure and it may take a while 
to make it a fully operational and 
reliable system. In other words, 
we dont want people to expect 
the kind of service they get from 
the Andrew system through the 
wired network.'

Building technology will take 
a giant leap forward in 1996, 
thanks in part to CMUs Architec
ture Department.
Thats when the Intelligent 
Workplace, now under con
struction on the roof of Marga
ret Morrison Carnegie Hall, is 
scheduled for completion.
With this living laboratory, 
the Architecture Departments 
Center for Building Performance 
and Diagnostics (CBPD) hopes 
to create more productive, effi
cient, and safe workplaces.
The CBPD offered a sneak peek 
at the project on Friday. Profes
sor Volker Hartkopf, a member
of the CBPD, said that 25 percent 
of the U.S.s 50 million office 
workers work in sick buildings. 
Sick buidlings suffer from design 
problems that encourage things 
like the spread of viruses or re
petitive stress injuries.
The program is being con
ducted by the department, using 
money donated by organizations 
from all over the world. Besides 
Hartkopf, architecture faculty 
members Stephen Lee, Vivian 
Loftness, Ardeshi Mahdavi, and 
Steven Duckworth are part of 
the CBPD.
Hartkopf said that while the 
need for heating, air condition
ing, and power efficiency has 
grown, building technology 
hasnt. Cramped, sealed, lightless office buildings have caused 
losses in productivity and
energy.
Part of it is becuase of the 
heat and enegy load that the 
circuits were never meant to 
handle, the lighting load and air 
quality have been worsened, and 
there is an elevated illness rate, 
he said.
From 1981 until 1991, illness 
in the workplace was up 1,000 
percent. From 1991 until 1993 
it was up an additional 500 per
cent.
The office is designed to be 
very flexible, unlike many of 
the office buildings of today, 
which are built in a grid style. 
Lee called them sealed glass 
boxes.
The Intelligent Workplace is 
designed to be easily changed 
and added onto as needs and 
technology dictate.
Mehrabian resignation stuns campus
President will leave campus in 1997

by Kenton Shaver
Staffwriter
Published October 2,1995
On an otherwise calm Friday 
afternoon, CMU President Rob
ert Mehrabian shocked the Uni
versity by announcing that he 
will retire in early 199V due to 
personal reasons.
There are times in your 
life you have to make certain 
choices, Mehrabian said. My 
wife is in California. She went 
there last summer. Her dad is 
very sick, so she went there to 
be with him when he died. Right 
after that, her mom got very sick 
and had major surgery. With 
his wife choosing to remain in 
California to be with her mother, 
Mehrabian is going to join her.
Hes not going to another insti
tution, said Thomas McConomy, 
the Chairman of the Universitys 
Board of Trustees, in response to 
Mehrabians decision. I hate like 
the devil to see him leave. I think 
hes done a marvelous job here, 
he said.
Mehrabian reaffirmed McConomys aim about not going to an
other institution. When youre 
the president of an institution 
like this, you cant be in the mar
ket, he said. As of now, he has no 
idea of what he is going to do in 
California.
It is unfortunate that Presi
dent Mehrabian has decided to 
leave Carnegie Mellon, said 
Gina Schuyler, Student, Body 
President. He has made sig
nificant contributions to CMUs 
development into a highly re
spected institution, and he will 
be difficult to replace.
Replacing a university presi
dent is no small task. McConomy 
said that a replacement will most 
likely not be found this year. The 
search will be very broad. It will 
be outside and inside [the Uni
versity], he said. People within 
the University will be considered 
as candidates, McConomy said, 
noting that the two most impor
tant questions to ask are who is 
qualified and who wants the job.
Mehrabian said that he cur
rently plans to stay on board 
until his successor is found, but 
does not want to help in the 
search process. I dont think its 
appropriate for a sitting Presi
dent to be directly involved in se
lecting his or her successor, he 
said. The trustees are in charge 
and the faculty will help with the 
search.
Referring to CMU as a great 
school, Mehrabian cited the Uni
versity Center, increased appli
cations for freshman admission, 
and improved retention rates as 
some of the schools strongest 
developments since he left his 
position as Dean of the College 
of Engineering at the University 
of California at Santa Barbara to 
succeed Richard Cyert as UniverFile photorue pnoi
President Mehrabian said he would resign due to personal reasons in 97.
sity President in 1990. In 1990, 
we lost 15.5 percent of our fresh
men.... This year were down to 
9.8 percent, Mehrabian said.
When Dr. Mehrabian came 
we had 6,400 applications, and 
now were over 14,000, McCo
nomy said. The increase in appli
cations to CMU has far surpassed 
the nations overall average in
crease in application for univer
sity admission. McConomy said 
that Mehrabians commitment 
to undergraduate education has 
been a strong factor in helping 
the Universitys reputation.
According to McConomy; He 
[Mehrabian] pressed very hard 
for us to do more than counsel
ing and advising. We feel that 
did a lot to improve the retention 
rate.
As for the University Center, 
the construction of which Meh
rabian has been involved with 
from the onset, everything will 
continue along schedule. I dont 
think this will have any effect on 
the center at all, said Ed Schatz, 
senior vice president in charge of 
the University Centers construc
tion.
Everythings going to con
tinue, Mehrabian said. We may 
even have to accelerate.
Michael Murphy, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, has worked closely 
with Mehrabian over the years. 
He has been great to work with. 
He was a hard-charger, but also 
team-oriented, Murphy said. 
One of his most important 
qualities is his compassion. This 
is especially true in working 
with students, where he has al
ways been very actively involved 
whenever there was a special 
need or crisis.
In fact, Mehrabian has estab
lished a relationship with students even outside of crisis situa
tions. I used to play soccer with 
the teams until I tore the liga
ments in my knee, he recalled.
Students expressed surprise 
at Mehrabians announcement, 
as well as criticism for his rela
tionship with students. There 
hadnt been any rumors before
hand, said Brian Fredrickson, a 
sophomore in CIT.
Fredrickson also expressed 
hope for Mehrabians replace
ment. I never see Mehrabian, 
he said. Maybe well get a 
president that well actually see 
around. I think Ive seen him 
once [and] that was at a speech 
last year at Orientation.
Other students expressed sim
ilar sentiments. How can I miss 
someone Ive never seen? asked 
Benjamin Roberts, a freshman 
undeclared in H&SS.
He doesnt have that much 
contact with the students, and 
thats disappointing in a presi
dent, said Kara Weeks, a senior 
drama major. Weeks said that she 
was surprised at the announce
ment, Especially since he signed 
a contract four months ago.
Under President Mehrabians 
leadership, Carnegie Mellon has 
remained among the nations top 
25 highest ranked universities. 
Applications for the freshman 
class have hit an all-time high. 
The University endowment has 
grown by almost $200 million. 
Construction to renovate the 
campus including the Univer
sity Center and the new fine arts 
center has been implemented. 
Research (up 7.5 percent 
thus year) has also continued 
to grow.
This is a great school, Meh
rabian said. Im going to be re
ally sorry to go.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 9, 2006
Carnegie Mellon ranked as a new Ivy League school by Newsweek
for the top students. Excluded one spot to number 21 on the list rankings are an excellent way experience.
by Andrew Peters
Staffwriter 
August 28, 2006
Forget the Nerdy Nine  
Carnegie Mellon is a new Ivy.
On August 21, Newsweek and 
Kaplan released their annual 
How To Get Into College guide, 
which ranks both universities 
and academic programs. How 
to Get Into College is published 
with a list of 25 Hot Schools. 
This year, in a special feature, 
Carnegie Mellon was named as 
one of 25 New Ivies.
According to Newsweek, the 
universities named as New 
Ivies have seen a rise in 
stature to rival the Ivy League 
and other traditional academic 
powerhouses in competing for 
the nations top students.
Otherschoolsonthelistinclude 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
Boston College, Bowdoin 
University, New York University, 
and the Claremont colleges. The 
schools on Newsweeks lists are 
notactuallypartofthelvyLeague, 
but rather compete with Ivies
for the top students. Excluded 
from the New Ivy list are more 
traditional academic giants such 
as Stanford, Northwestern, and 
Caltech.
The article also listed overlap 
schools comparable to Carnegie 
Mellon that compete for the same 
students. They include Cornell, 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT), the University 
of Pennsylvania, Juilliard, and 
the Eastman School of Music.
Were all schools that are 
extremely powerful in this field of 
higher education, said William 
Elliott, Carnegie Mellons vicepresident of enrollment.
How To Get Into College also 
ranks Carnegie Mellon number 
75 on its list of Top Global 
Universities. Elliott, however, 
was quick to note that the higher 
a university is ranked, the harder 
it is to keep moving up.
Youve got to be really 
exceptional when you get to the 
top of these rankings, Elliott 
said. The rest of the world isnt 
standing still.
Carnegie Mellon also worked 
its way up in the U.S. News & 
World Report rankings, climbing
one spot to number 21 on the list 
of Top National Universities. 
The university shares its number 
with University of California at 
Berkeley.
Rankings are based on a 
number of factors, including 
peer assessment, graduation 
and retention rates, faculty-tostudent ratio, and selectivity: 
The U.S. News rankings do not, 
however, take athletics, social 
life, academic offerings, or cost 
into account, leading some to 
question how useful the rankings 
really are.
I think the general public has 
made these rankings important, 
Elliott said. Its certainly 
reflective of the work we do, but 
we dont run the university to 
raise the rankings.
As well as overall ranking, 
Carnegie Mellons engineering 
and business programs both 
received top-10 nationwide 
rankings. The engineering 
program also received top20 rankings for its individual 
program?civil, environmental, 
mechanical, chemical, and 
computer engineering.
While Elliott admits that
rankings are an excellent way 
to sell magazines, he also knows 
how much they can influence the 
general public.
Wed rather be on the list than 
off, and wed rather be higher 
than lower, he said.
To add to a growing list of 
national rankings, Carnegie 
Mellon was also ranked as one 
of the top 100 best scholastic 
environments for lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender 
(LGBT) students, according 
to an August 15 article in The 
Advocate called The Advocate 
Guide for LGBT Students. The 
guide is the first of its kind to list 
LGBT-friendly schools.
This ranking comes on the heels 
of copious LGBT programming 
led by former Coordinator of 
Student Development Rowshan 
Palmer, and her recent successor, 
Helen Wang. Wang oversees 
the coordination of LGBT 
programming on campus, 
aiming to raising awareness 
of LGBT issues in residential 
communities.
According to Wang, awareness 
of the LGBT lifestyle is key to 
every Carnegie Mellon education
experience.
We want to make [LGBT 
issues] have meaning to everyone 
on campus, Wang said. We are 
working to cultivate this culture 
of awareness on campus.
SOHO, CMU Allies, cmuOUT, 
and Safezone comprise Carnegie 
Mellons LGBT community, all 
of which promote the kind of 
culture that supports talking 
about LGBT issues. SOHOs goal 
is to provide a safe space for 
people of all sexual orientations 
to feel comfortable discussing 
issues surrounding gender and 
identity.
Can we connect with someone 
from athletics? Can we connect 
with someone from architecture? 
From music? Wang asked, 
speaking of how the group raises 
awarness. Can we connect, not 
myopically, but really listen to 
what staff and students want to 
say?
According to Wang, The 
Advocates ranking shows the 
Universitys potential. Wang 
would like to see the University 
parlay the ranking into an 
increasingly open and tolerant 
community.
Newest Gates Center for Computer Science designs presented
File Photo
The Gates Center, designed by Mark Scogin, will one day look like the above model. At present, it looks more like an unsightly hole on campus. It will take up 5.6 arces on West Campus.
by Andrew Peters
Staffwriter 
April 10, 2006
Architect Mack Scogin walked 
onto the Carnegie Mellon campus 
last Monday, and he did not come 
empty-handed. He brought with 
him a design that he hopes will 
revolutionize Carnegie Mellon 
and send it hurtling into the 
future. Scogin and his partner 
Merrill Elam have been designing 
the Gates Center for Computer 
Science for almost a year now, 
and on Monday they were finally 
ready to give the campus a 
preview of the 159,000-squarefoot Gates Center, which with 
its surrounding landscaping 
will take up 5.6 acres of West 
Campus.
In a lecture at Carnegie Lecture 
Hall in Oakland, Scogin spoke 
at great length about Henry 
Hornbostel, Carnegie Mellons 
first architect. Scogins design for 
the Gates Center was in large part
influenced by his interpretation 
of Hornbostels bold designs.
Hamerschlag Hall, Porter 
Hall, Baker Hall  this is some 
of the weirdest, strangest 
architecture by an iconoclastic 
architect, Scogin said, referring 
to Hornbostels use of domes, 
arches, pediments, and other 
simple architectural devices in 
complex and creative ways.
On a less philosophical level, 
the administration and the School 
of Computer Science had some 
very specific goals in mind for a 
new building on campus. Ralph 
Horgan, associate vice-provost 
of Campus Design and Facility 
Development, explained, The 
major elements of the building 
program were linking the Cut 
with the West Campus  in fact, 
creating a new west campus quad 
that would rival in space the Cut 
and the Mall for open space on 
this campus. He also noted the 
desire to create a proper entrance 
on Forbes Avenue.
According to Guy Blelloch,
associate dean for planning for 
the School of Computer Science, 
the purpose of the building is 
to get Computer Science back 
together. The department is 
currently distributed among 
several locations, including 
buildings on Craig Street.
According to Blelloch, the 
space would also have to be 
conducive to collective and 
interdisciplinary work.
One of the things that 
was very important to us was 
collaboration, Blelloch said. 
We want to foster collaboration 
within the School of Computer 
Science, but also help other 
people from other schools to 
collaborate with us.
Attached to the Gates Center 
itself will be another, smaller 
building, tentatively named the 
Donor X building. The original 
grant from the Gates Foundation 
specified a 150,000-squarefoot building, but according to 
Horgan, SCS needed at least
200,000 square feet of space to
move completely out of Wean 
Hall. The decision was made then 
to attach a 50,000-square-foot 
building to the Gates Center and 
create a naming opportunity. So 
far, there is no Donor X.
The center will feature an 
eight-foot-wide bridge from 
outside the Purnell Center, a 
cafe, a private underground 
parking garage, 318 offices, a 
250-seat auditorium, a threestory glass-walled walkway 
between Gates and Donor X, and 
a landscaped link to the Cut. An 
internal ramp system will take 
pedestrians through the core 
of the building. The oval ramp 
spans three floors and will wrap 
around classrooms, offices, and 
an open computer cluster.
The new planetary robotics 
center will be on the lowest 
level, with access to the loading 
docks. Scogin plans to build the 
planetary robotics department a 
rugged open space called a Mars 
Yard meant to mimic the terrain 
of Mars. The yard will used to
test new robots and will be highly 
accessible to pedestrians using 
West Campus.
All the exterior materials will 
require little or no maintenance, 
in accordance with Scogins goal 
that the Gates Center be a 100- 
year building, or that no part 
of it will need to be repaired or 
replaced for at least 100 years. 
The Donor X building, in addition 
to parts of the Gates Center, will 
feature green roofs. According to 
Scogin, he had been aiming for a 
LEED silver rating, but admitted 
they can do better. Ralph Horgan 
believes the building may be in a 
position to receive a gold rating.
But will the Gates Center fit 
with the rest of campus? Scogin 
says it will. It will fit. It will 
be different  it will speak to 
something about the future of 
the University.... You cant make 
the mistake of something too 
modest, too small. Hornbostel 
would be the first to tell you, 
Dont do that, for Gods sake! Use 
the tools of your time.
Forum held to discuss sculptures, public art on CMU campus
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor 
March 27, 2006
If art imitates life, life just got a little 
more controversial.
The newly formed Public Art 
Committee held an open meeting on 
Wednesday, March 8, in the University 
Centers Connan Room to discuss the 
locations of two new pieces of art: 
a bronze sculpture of alumnus Mao 
Yisheng, and the sculpture Walking to 
the Sky by alumnus Jonathan Borofsky.
Dean of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) 
and Chair of the Public Art Committee 
(PAC) Hilary Robinson led the forum. 
Robinson stressed that, as the PAC 
had already approved both pieces, the 
forum was merely to discuss where 
the sculptures would be installed on 
campus.
Alumna and trustee Jill Gansman 
Kraus has donated the 100-foot-tall 
Walking to the Sky to Carnegie Mellon; 
the piece is to be permanently displayed 
on campus.
At the forum, Robinson introduced the 
sculptures preferred site  on the Cut, 
just left of the tree on the south side of 
the sidewalk near Forbes Avenue outside 
Warner Hall.
Its far back enough from the road to 
allow for the development of a future
gateway on campus, Robinson said, 
and it was felt that it let people onto the 
campus as well.
Other potential sites included the Cut, 
near the clock outside of Doherty Hall; 
the Hornbostel Mall; the Cut, near the 
tennis courts; and the area of the Cut 
behind the bus stop.
In initiating debate about the siting, 
Robinson noted the sculptures merits.
It talks about ambition, it talks about 
reaching for the sky and I think thats a 
great thing for this university, she said.
Is this item the first thing that shows up 
in every photograph [of campus], and is 
that the manifestation of our educational 
and social and environmental agendas? 
asked Vivian Loftness, a professor in 
architecture. Loftness, who served on 
the Design Review Committee that 
initially discussed the sculpture and 
possible locations, expressed concern 
with placing the sculpture as an axial 
statement of campus.
I think that has been the concern with 
the [siting] on the Mall  it takes over 
the imagery of the Mall. And I think in 
some respects thats the same problem 
here  that [for the] view of campus 
from Forbes Avenue, this becomes the 
first and maybe the last statement in that 
view because it is such a large piece, 
Loftness said.
Loftness was referring to one of the 
original plans to place the sculpture at
the top of the Mall, between Doherty and 
Baker Halls. Last fall, digging began on 
the site for placement of the sculpture, 
and a square concrete base was poured 
in the ground.
When University officials created 
the Public Art Committee, however, 
they decided the new committee would 
reconsider the sculptures location.
I do think the arts are not as visible 
on this campus as they ought to be, given 
their centrality to the history of the 
University, said Judy Cole, director of 
Alumni Relations. Personally I love the 
piece, and I love the site.
Dan Boyarski, head of the design 
school, agreed. I think [with] anything 
like this, once youve gotten used to it, 
youll pass by it, he said.
Members of the School of Art cited a 
lack of both public and contemporary art 
and noted the defining presence of public 
art on such campuses as Princeton, 
Harvard, and the University of San 
Diego.
Some campus members were not so 
sure.
I think the art part of the campus is 
getting in the face of people who dont 
have an appreciation for art, said Mark 
Adamson, an alumnus and Computing 
Services staff member.
Theyre putting it right out in front of 
campus, and theyre saying This is the 
campus. Theres more than artists on
campus. I dont think CFA would like it if 
we put a 16-foot model of an IBM 360 in 
the front of campus.
GordonLewis, aHeinz School professor 
and chair of the Faculty Affairs Council, 
agreed.
To me, it defines us as a leading 
university that doesnt believe in physics, 
he said. Where it is, I immediately feel 
that it defines us in the wrong way. 
According to Robinson, the committees 
aim is to have the piece installed by 
commencement.

The biggest and best events to experience over this Homecoming weekend
EVENTS, from B1
understanding of Carnegie 
Mellon history.
Of interest to all
Homecoming will be filled 
with learning on the part of 
students and alumni alike.
Friday includes various 
open classes, giving alumni 
the chance to experience 
being a Carnegie Mellon 
student in 2006. Classes 
include architecture open 
studios, a class called Robotic 
Manipulation, and one 
called Spies & Assassins in 
19th Century Europe, 1790- 
1910. In addition, students
can attend lectures and 
workshops hosted by alumni. 
An intriguing one is definitely 
Whats Happened in Buggy 
Since I Graduated, in which 
active PiKA alumnus Tom 
Wood of the class of 74 will 
talk about the changes in 
Buggy that he has witnessed 
over the last 30 years.
Aside from numerous
alumni events, there are a 
ton of activities that students 
would also enjoy. On Thursday 
at 7 p.m. in Merson Courtyard, 
Mayur kicks things off with 
their Diwali-Eid: Festival of 
Light celebration, including 
a henna artist, an $8 buffet, 
and a diya-lighting ceremony. 
On Saturday, during the early 
morning hours of 6 to 9 a.m.,
spectators can watch Buggy 
freerolls on Tech and Frew 
Streets and Schenley Drive. 
At noon, the Third Annual 
Homecoming Chili Cookoff 
will take place in the West 
Wing Courtyard.
The campus community will 
celebrate its achievements 
past, present, and future 
once again this October
weekend. As the age-old 
tradition of Homecoming 
continues, Carnegie Mellon 
will continue honor its alumni 
and advocate connections 
with students. And although 
this Homecoming will not 
feature a showcase by our 
undefeated football team due 
to scheduling conflicts, it will 
be enjoyable nonetheless.

Alums play at Homecoming Did know?
Love Letters chronicles lost love and taking chances
If your heart is beating and youve stepped 
outside your house, it is inevitable that sometime, 
somewhere, youve met someone who has made 
your heart go pitter-pat. But what if you didn't 
have the confidence to tell this person your true 
feelings, and so you were left to wonder, "What 
couldve happened? This is the premise of A.R. 
Gurneys play Love Letters, which will be performed 
at Carnegie Mellon during Homecoming weekend. 
Love Letters follows the poignant and often 
heartbreaking tale of a man.and a woman who, after 
missing a chance for true love at an early age, spend 
the rest of their lives corresponding through letters, 
hoping that one day a letter in the mailbox will 
deliver a message of reciprocation.
Love Letters, a two-person play, is about the 
relationship between Andrew Makepeace Ladd 
ID and Melissa Gardner, played by alums Peter 
Jason (66) and Caroline McWilliams (67). The 
two characters are polar opposites  Melissa is 
an eccentric artist, Andrew is a Yale-educated 
lawyer  yet they have a profound understanding 
of and love for one another. The play follows their 
correspondence from a third-grade birthday partys 
thank-you note to the love letters of their adulthood. 
Although both are attracted to one another, their 
confessions never coincide, and so the plot simmers 
with their frustrated love.
Ladd is played by Jason, an accomplished actor in 
over 100 movies, including small roles in Seabiscuit 
and Kicking and Screaming, since graduating from 
Carnegie Mellon. Although the reserved demeanor 
of lawyer Andrew Makepeace is a far cry from 
Jasons typically vibrant personality, the role wont 
be too much of a stretch for the actor who admitted, 
"I used to have a crush on Caroline McWilliams for 
so long. He added, "I love [Caroline and executive 
producer Iris Rainer Dart] a lot, so it will be great to 
get back together with them."
McWilliams, who plays the role of Gardner and who is 
also directing the play, met Jason as an undergraduate 
at Carnegie Mellon. After dating their senior year, the 
two have remained friends and occasionally work on 
projects together. Acting is much easier because hes 
my friend, but directing a friend is much harder than
directing someone who's not... but we trust each other. 
Thats the ingredient thats needed.to do this kind of 
thing, and we have that in great measure.
Both actors acknowledge that trust and friendship 
are valuable resources in show biz, and Carnegie 
Mellon taught them that. [The Carnegie Mellon 
drama program] broke down ego and created a 
family. Thats what lacks out here in Hollywood," 
Jason said, who is currently writing a book called 
Change Clothes and Look for Parking about his 
hectic and often cutthroat life as an actor in 
Hollywood. Jason has been a professional actor for
42 years and said that although the drama program 
teaches the best training in technique, what it 
doesnt prepare students for is rejection.
Dart, the shows executive producer, turned 
to writing after a few discouraging years as a 
struggling actress in Hollywood. Her best-selling 
novel, Beaches, was made into a film starring 
Bette Midler. Dart, Jason, and McWilliams are very 
excited to be returning to campus to collaborate 
once again, and, most importantly, to work with the 
current talent in the drama program. McWilliams 
said she was most excited about returning to 
Carnegie Mellon and seeing what the student 
lighting director will be able to create. The training 
[at Carnegie Mellon] doesnt get any better, so Im 
excited to see what the lighting designer creates 
with only a few looks. 
Love Letters is being produced by School of Drama 
senior Kevin Emrick, who is currently taking a 
semester to intern with Aaron Sorkin, the creator 
of The West Wing. Not only will Love Letters 
give drama students the opportunity to make 
connections with alumni in preparation for the 
world of show business, but it will also be a great 
source of enjoyment. As Jason put it, It's called a 
play. Its about all the fun you can have." .
Love Letters will be playing at Carnegie Mellon's 
Philip Chosky Theater on Saturday at 5 p.m. For 
ticket availability, contact the Purnell Center Box 
Office, x8-2407. Admission is tee.

Students for Eisenhower assembled for their 
first meeting; topics of discussion included Ikes 
upcoming visit to Pittsburgh. A signature scroll 
was passed among students and would serve, as 
a birthday present to the commander-in-chief later 
that month. The present was a capital idea, but 
what the dickens was Ike going to do with it?
Students were encouraged to make noise in the 
Fifth Annual Powder Milk Mouth-Off on the variety 
show A Prairie Home Companion, broadcast by 
WQED-FM. Interested applicants could send a 
cassette tape of their favorite orally-created sound 
effect, and entries were limited to two and half 
minutes in length. I guess this means I couldnt 
have submitted my two-hour vocal interpretation 
of 2000 flushes.
Dizzy Murphy was torn away from his Super 
Nintendo long enough this week to write the article 
Friday Night Doom, a weekly review of the latest in 
video games. He detailed Crusader: No Remorse, 
which he found to be a very addictive and enter
taining game. It shows: Dizzy was entering his fifth 
year in Social and Decision Sciences. No rush, 
Dizzy; take your time.
Sleepy students studying late at night in Hunt 
Library were aroused by an unexpected stimula
tion. An unidentified male was peeking through the 
stacks, but that was not the only thing doing some 
peeking. His penis was showing. Apparently his 
attire was ripped and dirty in all the wrong, but oh 
so right, places. Maybe next time hes allowed in 
the library, he should find a book on Australia and 
things that should stay down under.
The Recording Industry Association of America 
(RIAA) continued to keep a close eye on Carnegie 
Mellon students downloading. Warning students 
not to share illegal music, the RIAA threatened to 
issue subpoenas to those in violation of the copy
right code. Too bad the Kiltie Band can no longer 
have free access to Bagpipings Best.

The Evens, featuring Ian 
MacKaye, played in Rangos 
Ballroom last Friday night.
Ian MacKaye does the unexpected with The Evens
Hardcore punk native MacKaye looks to indie rock for a change
The scene was quite strange as I walked into Rangos Ballroom 
on Friday night: a baritone guitar and a minimal drum set and 
two lamps made from microphone stands on either side of the 
stage. This was definitely not the Ian MacKaye I had expected 
to see.
You see, 25 years ago, MacKaye, a Washington D.C., native, 
fronted one of the first hardcore punk bands, Minor Threat. 
Minor Threat went on to become one of the more signifigant 
punk groups: Everyone from Sublime to Rancid cites their 
influence. After Minor Threat disbanded, MacKaye formed 
another punk group, Fugazi, which also became famous on 
the punk scene, selling several gold records along the way. So 
naturally, when The Evens, MacKayes next project, came out 
in 2005 after Fugazi amicably disbanded, more lightning-fast, 
crunchy punk tunes were expected  so were screaming, 
thrashing, and yeah, some mosh-pitting. Alas, The Evens are 
far, far from this expectation. Nevertheless, The Evens are 
a pleasant surprise: Compositionally, they are a two-person 
indie rock-influenced group. Lyrically, they are progressive, 
forward-thinking intellectuals, and, with a quite obviously 
experienced MacKaye as the bands figurehead, they are 
engaging, entertaining, and exciting performers.
With the audience of hipsters and punks, the high-heeled 
sitting eagerly by the foot of the stage, the group launched 
into "Shelter Two," an interesting bridge between the old 
and the new. With snappy brushwork from drummer Amy 
Farina and subtle, yet on-edge guitar melodies from MacKaye 
beckoning early Broken Social Scene material, the boyfriendgirlfriend duo sang with the same ambition that has made 
MacKaye so respected for the past 25 years: We keep 
climbing but we never find the top/It's all downhill from here."
It was this balance of old political and social commentary 
and a newfound sense of melody, technical prowess, and 
compositional integrity that made The Evens so special. From 
songs written in 7/8 to funky, riff-oriented grooves, to the 
shuffle and swagger of Crude Bomb, MacKaye and Farina 
always had a fabulous blend of witty and accessible music 
and intelligent, well-versed lyrics. In the opening section of 
the on-edge Mt. Pleasant," MacKaye encouraged the crowd 
to participate in chanting the songs refrain, The police 
will not be excused/The police will not behave," which the 
crowd did with much enthusiasm. MacKayes commentary 
was continuous throughout the set: Stay engaged, and stay 
involved, MacKaye later cautioned. "The government is 
going to leave a big mess [after the war in Iraq], and we have 
got to clean it up. When MacKaye asked if there were any 
apathetics in the crowd, it came as no surprise that several 
kids cheered. MacKaye warned, The apathetic party is the 
biggest party out there; bigger than the Democrats. Youre the 
ones calling the shots.
Along with the moments of activism and gravity came silly 
fun and playful interaction between artist and audienc. 
(MacKaye called this symbiotic relationship a punk 
concept.) At the beginning of Sara Lee," MacKaye and the 
audience whistled along with glee, which quickly evolved into 
clicking and clucking (much to MacKayes delight). The song 
itself, seemingly inspired by Wilcos Radio Cure, was packed 
with a mallet-based drum pattern, eerie guitar chords, and 
most impressively, a rich vocal melody from MacKaye, who, 
for the past 25 years, has rarely sung on key.
And as the couple swayed through the tune, you couldnt help 
but smile, knowing that as far as MacKaye has come, hes still
having a great time, and still playing with the same passion 
and intensity that he had 25 years ago, even if it is through 
whistling and on-key singing.
Whether youre an Ian MacKaye fanatic or not, The Evens are 
definitely a deviation from his other musical projects. Why 
keep doing the same thing for your whole career? MacKaye 
said after the show. I wanted to do something new, and I did 
it. Just when you think that The Evens are another musical 
framework for MacKaye to express his own political views, 
Farina says, Everything Ian says in his songs I believe, and 
everything I sing, he believes. Although it is somewhat of a 
bumpy transition from hardcore to punk to indie, MacKaye is 
still as passionate and as driven as ever, and The Evens are 
just as rockin', just as awesome, as anything MacKaye has 
ever done.

After Miss Julie addresses fundamental human fears in real time

the decidedly provocative After Miss Julie, a play thrilling exploration of our own sort of attempts to deal
opening at the Philip Chosky Theatre this Wednesday. with being human.
Iskandar, a second-year master of fine arts candidate in 
the School of Drama, is directing the production.
The play was originally written by August Strindberg in 
1888. In the adaptation Iskandar uses, the setting has 
been modernized to a post-World War n London. Aftei 
Miss Julie takes place on July 26,1945, when Britains 
Labour Party has won control of Parliament for the first 
time. The updated adaptation preserves Strindberg's 
self-described vision of "modem characters living in 
a period of transition more feverishly hysterical than 
any other. The rise of the Labour Party and its leader, 
Prime Minister Clement Atlee, represents the declining 
old British aristocratic order and the burgeoning 
new socialist order," said Greg Van Horn, production 
dramaturg for After Miss Julie.
Miss Julie, played by Kara Lindsay, is a member of the 
aristocracy who has her sights set on John, one of her 
fathers servants. Complicating matters even more, John 
(Rich Dreher) is already engaged to Christine (Kristen 
Bracken), a cook in the same household. After Miss Julie 
is the graphic struggle that ensues between the three 
characters for someone to spend their lives with. ItS'a 
savagely comic game of cat and mouse, Iskandar said. 
The play addresses the most fundamental human fear: 
loneliness, and what we are willing to do to avoid it.
After Miss Julie represents Strindbergs innovation 
in dramatic history to a new naturalism. Naturalistic 
theater was Strindbergs reaction to the theater of 
excess prevalent in his time period. This theater of 
excess was a multitude of "multiple scene changes, 
excessive costuming, overblown characters, and 
overblown theatricality," Iskandar explained. The 
resulting productions were "completely unreal; 
always at the service of a clever plot which was 
relied on to bring in the money," he said. Strindbergs 
naturalistic theater attempts to create a more authentic 
representation of life.
This genre of theater "demands that dramatists adhere 
to an uncompromising realism in content, staging, and 
time, Van Horn explained. After Miss Julie does just 
that. The play uses only a single set and is for the most 
part a single scene extending for the entirety of the 
90-minute production. This is the first play in history 
to employ a single set in an uninterrupted sequence, 
said Iskandar. The effect of this naturalism in relation to 
setting and timing is "an attempt to simulate realistic 
psychological progression as well as a realistic set of 
events.
As a result of the naturalistic approach in After Miss 
Julie, the characters are very realistic. Van Horn 
said they are "rich, dynamic people with complex 
psychologies and souls, not a compilation of simple 
phrases and motivations. Miss Julie, John, and
The characters struggle between their own desires and 
societal constraints is at once comedic and tragic. "The 
play, I find, observes moments of alternating incredible 
hilarity and tragedy, which I think is very real, Iskandar 
said. "It finds the balance between unexpected humor 
and moments of sort of desperate need. This vacillation 
between the two opposites finds its place in the 
extreme nature of some of the plays action. After Miss 
Juile depicts "a woman having her period on stage, 
birds getting killed, and devirginization," according to 
Iskandar.
Despite the plays original 1888 script, it still allows 
for modem identification with the characters strife. 
Iskandar believes his production of After Miss Julie is 
an extremely accessible reading of a pretty demanding 
text. He feels the play retains a freshness for current 
audiences. I find it contemporary. It is bitchy. It is 
slightly campy in the right way. It is an explosion of 
passion that is slightly bigger than what we experience 
in daily life.
After Miss Julie opens in the Philip Chosky Theatre 
this Wednesday at 8 p.m. The Chosky is located inside 
of the Purnell Center for the Arts. It is also showing on 
Thursday at 8 p.m. and on Friday at 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. 
Tickets are free but must be obtained from the box 
office on the first level of Purnell and will be available 
starting an hour before each performance. The Chosky 
seats about 600 people, and Iskandar insisted that ticket 
availability is almost guaranteed.

In high school I was always the kid walking around the halls with my 
headphones on, rocking out in my own little world. People unfamiliar 
with the concept of a "one-person dance party stared at me like I 
was psychotic. I never minded; I just had a good time. The music 
that bled through my headphones into the surrounding hallway was 
not the Top 40 or Dirty South that was popular at my school at the 
time; it was loud, typically anthemic, and reasonably impassioned. 
Now, three years after having strayed from the aforementioned 
angsty genre in which 1 once found interest, Against Me! remains a 
personal outlet.
The four piece from Gainesville, Fla., is laden with acoustic guitar, 
syncopated drums, and harsh, semi-yelling vocals. They are 
considered folk-punk, a genre which I initially labeled as being too 
abrasive. I didnt truly understand or appreciate the genre until I saw 
Against Me! live. The show was unlike any which I had experienced; 
it seemed as though everyone knew every lyric to every song. It 
was like a huge pub: Hundreds of people sang the same semipolitical choruses in a pleasantly dissonant roar. The band broke a 
collective sweat from dancing and exerting more energy than I could 
have ever expected. There were no mosh pits or girls wearing Ugg 
boots. The show wasn't treated as a place where individuals prove 
their devotion to a specific genre through their clothing choices 
or attitudes. That night was just a bunch of people together in a 
room sharing music, dance and an obtuse feeling of camaraderie;
1 was with a group of friends to whom I had never actually been 
introduced. I havent been to a concert like that since.
Every so often 1 walk along the Cut at night and hear a bunch of 
guys with acoustic guitars singing random Against Mei songs. They 
sit in a circle strumming and singing at the top of their lungs, not 
caring about who is trying to study around them or who actually likes 
the band. I hear:
Everyone would leave with the memory that there was no place else 
in the world/And this waswhere they always belonged/ We would 
dance like no one was watching... /Just gimme a scene where the 
music is free/And the beer is not the life of the party/ There's no 
need to shit talk or impress/ Cause honesty and emotion are not 
looked down upon,
and it reminds me of that night at the show. I crack a smile, knowing 
that there are still people who iove music for how it makes them 
feel, not for the scene or a prescriptive image. They appreciate how 
music should bring people together and make, them happy, not selfconscious. Consider this a thanks to those guys, from the kid with 
the headphones.

Freud in the bedroom and fleshy-colored nouns
Words are colors and songs are shapes in designer Martin Wattenbergs world
Dozens of blue semicircles of varying sizes meander across a 
horizontal axis, some repeating in a uniformly-sized arc again 
and again, while others hop along at random intervals and at 
random sizes. This, Martin Wattenberg asserts, is the shape of 
Beethoven's "Fr Elise." The arcs connect repeating sections of 
the musical score to convey the overall structure, or shape, of the 
song. Wattenberg displays the shapes of several songs, from the 
folk song "Clementine" to John Coltrane.
Wattenberg's investigation into the shape of song is part of 
his overall mission to make the invisible visible. He explained 
the thought processes and engineering behind some of his 
most interesting projects in his lecture "Revelatory Interfaces," 
presented in the comfortably crowded McConomy Auditorium 
last Tuesday. His Shape of Sound project uses a computer to 
detect repetition in musical scores and draw the corresponding 
arcs. One of my favorite types of music to look at is jazz," 
Wattenberg said. It begins with a series of repetitions and then it 
takes off and often baffles the computer.
Wattenberg translates complex social data into images.
His images have been exhibited at the London Institute of 
Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art 
in New York City, among others. The images are beautiful and  
artistic, but they are also designed to relay information about our 
culture. Wattenbergs visualizations provide everyday people with 
new toys to play with, new tools for investigation, and new ways 
of understanding.
Wattenberg studied mathematics at Brown and Stanford, and 
earned his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. He 
uses algorithms to analyze data and create visualizations, and is
currently working as a researcher at IBM in Boston. In all sorts of 
ways we're bombarded with information; it's just not organized 
well, Wattenberg said. The visual presentation of information 
in both an accessible and beautiful format is what makes his 
work so innovative and unique. Wattenbergs extensive work in 
information visualization has made him one of the worlds 100 
top young innovators, according to Technology Review.
After demonstrating the shape of sound, Wattenberg goes 
on to present his history flow visualization. With history flow, 
Wattenberg sought to explain the success of websites like 
Wikipedia that provide articles written and edited by the online 
community. Anyone can edit it, and yet it is still very good in the 
sense that thousands of student papers have been written with 
it," he remarked. He analyzed the histories of every revision made 
to any given Wikipedia article by creating a visualization.
The history flow visual presents a horizontal axis measuring 
time and a vertical axis measuring the length, of the article. A 
different color represents each author of the article. By using 
visual analysis, you get a sense of whats going on underneath, 
Wattenberg explained. Simply looking at the patterns made by 
the colors as they spread across both' axes reveals how much 
each author has contributed, who has changed what, even 
when controversial articles have been completely deleted. The 
visualization solved the mystery of Wikipedias success: the 
incredible reaction speed of the online community. When articles 
are vandalized or deleted, the "median is 10 minutes before 
someone corrects the problem, according to Wattenberg.
Wattenberg worked in conjunction with Marek Walczak on 
another project called Apartment. Wattenberg said the concept
focused on building a city of words and memories. Users can 
access Apartment on the Internet. You are confronted by a 
blinking cursor and you just type. You could type memories. You 
could type junk. You could create anything and it will gradually 
create a building for you," Wattenberg explained. Different words 
that you type in will create and gravitate towards different rooms 
in the apartment. We classified by hand what room each word 
belonged in, Wattenberg said. He demonstrated several of his 
favorite apartments, one of which has the word ego circling 
around the dining room while id stays frozen in the closet and 
Freud" bounces around the bedroom.
Wattenberg went on to demonstrate his ambitious color codea 
categorization of language designed as a joint project between 
himself and Jonathan Feinberg. "Is there a way to think of the 
color of a word?" Wattenberg asked. I wanted to create a map of 
the entire English language." The map gives a color for more than
33,000 English nouns. The color shown for the nouns on the map 
is an average of all the pixel colors produced by a Yahoo! image 
search for the given noun. The resulting color code has a fleshy 
color to it, Wattenberg said. He explained that this is because 
"people are really important," and thus, our words resemble us.
Siobhan Hadley, a second-year graduate student studying 
communication planning and information design, was very 
impressed with Wattenberg's work. Its creative and it's 
original in the sense that you wouldnt ever think to apply 
certain visualizations. For music, you know it would look like 
this on a page or sound like this in a concert, but this puts it in a 
completely new form.

Cosby brings his sweaters to Heinz Hall
80s comedian and Jell-0 Jigglers spokesman performs in Pittsburgh
Lively jazz filled Heinz Hall Saturday night as the audience 
filled seats in anticipation for Bill Cosby. A grandfatherly faded 
sweatshirt with "Hello Friend in colorfully stitched lettering 
was draped over an arm chair that welcomed the audience 
before Cosby even stepped on stage.
Cosby, 69, walked on stage followed by audience members: 
an older gentleman, a 20-to-30-something, and three children 
ages 14,12, and 11. Speaking to each of them for a little while, 
Cosby cracked jokes about their observations, a type of humor 
that was to define the entire comedy routine.
Continuing to improvise, Cosby brought up a couple that 
had just celebrated their 50-year wedding anniversary. 
Remembering how her husband had proposed to her, the 
wife recalled that he had wanted to go "park afterwards.
After several more hilarious observations of married life in 
the question-and-answer format, Cosby ended their stint in 
the limelight by inviting the couple to go backstage, where 
a bed with rose petals was set up and a salad with little blue 
croutons was available for the husband.
Cosby gave his philosophy on marriage, "Marriage is closer 
to a game of chess than war.... The queen moves all over
the board ... the king sits there trying to get out of the way,
... looking for help,... [and] the queen is getting rid of all his 
friends.
During one of his interactions with an audience member, the 
man to whom Cosby was speaking responded with a gaffe. 
With the audience laughing, Cosby turned to his wife, Why 
are you laughing? You're with him!
Cosby also asked the audience for a definition of children, 
ultimately giving his own: beggars. Cosby observed how 
remarkable it is that children go to college claiming to want to 
get away from their parents and be independent. These same 
children, he said, then come back after getting their college 
degree, and that its usually Mom who lets them back in the 
house.
Although a senior citizen by age, Cosbys mind is as active 
and his humor as spirited as a person half his age. With years 
of experience behind him, Cosby transitioned between new 
topics and old, referring back to earlier topics with ease. While 
talking directly to audience members, Cosby was able to turn 
their innocuous answers to his questions into several-minute 
bits. Cosbys keen intellect didn't stop him from cracking an
Alzheimer's joke at his own expense.
Cosbys comedy focuses largely upon the family. His take on 
marriage, peppered with examples of his own relationship 
with his wife, comprised most of his material. Connecting 
with the largely middle-aged audience, Cosby addressed the 
differences between men and women, who really rules at 
home, and how Mom and Dad interact with their children.
Carnegie Mellon students who are married, plan to marry, or 
plan to have children can get a leg up on the married life by 
listening to Cosby. He does not bring up the light-hearted 
truths he so naturally preaches. Rather, his directed questions 
at audience members pushed his material forward in an eerily 
regular manner, showcasing that the general truths of life do 
not differ much from family to family.
Perhaps the best advice came from one of the audience 
members. When Cosby asked him for a word of wisdom from 
his 50 years of marriage, the man responded, Work hard and 
save your money. Cosby quipped, "Whats love got to do with 
it?

Streetcars define Pittsburghs transportation
From horses and mules, to cables and electricity, and finally to near-extinction, Pittsburghs trolley
relatively quick and easy mode of transportation that 
allowed people to live farther from the center of the city.
Trolleys similarly transformed downtown Pittsburgh. 
Formerly a mixed commercial and residential area, 
people started living outside the city and commuting 
to work. According to Tarr, the density of population 
downtown decreased from 45 persons per acre to 29.1 
between 1890 and 1900.
It was during the last two decades of the 19th century 
that many of Pittsburghs office buildings were built. 
Land downtown started to become scarcer, so rather 
than build outward horizontally, businesses started 
building vertically. At this point in history, people were 
not commuting 15-20 miles to work; most 19th century 
commuters lived one to five miles away from downtown.
If the trolley allowed people to five outside of the city, 
it may seem odd that so many people still lived near 
downtown. However, the reason for this is simple: Trolley 
fares became too expensive and the ride took too much 
time for steel workers. Tarr wrote that "in the more 
outlying mill areas, as high as 80 to 90 percent of the 
work force walked to work.
By 1910, the trolley industry was already experiencing 
difficulties. The construction of the rail and overhead 
cables that carried electricity to trolleys was quite costly 
Ironically, the trolley infrastructure wore out before the 
bonds that financed it were paid off. Edward Lybarger, 
archivist at the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum, said, The 
trolley industry was capital-intensive. They financed 20- 
to 30-year infrastructure with 50-year bonds.
The trolley industry began its struggle with debt, and 
things would only get worse with World War I and 
the Great Depression. Trolley companies had a poor 
relationship with city government  World War I 
caused major inflation in prices, but the city government 
prohibited fare increases. The Pittsburgh Railways 
Company (PRCo) was in receivership from 1918 to 1924. 
Despite this, the trolley system was at its pinnacle. 
According to Lybarger, PRCo had 598 miles of track 
as of 1924. To put Pittsburghs system in perspective,

Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh.

Before cars, buses, and bicycles but after feet and horses, the 
main modes of transportation were the streetcar and trolley.
Pittsburgh once had hundreds of trolleys  electric-powered 
vehicles that run on tracks  and even though they have 
mostly disappeared from the city, their effects and physical 
artifacts still linger.
Pittsburgh, at the confluence of three rivers, was a flourishing 
trade city in 1850. In an essay written in 1978 for the Public 
Works Historical Society titled Transportation Innovation and 
Changing Spatial Patterns in Pittsburgh, 1850-1934, Carnegie 
Mellon professor of history and policy Joel Tarr wrote that 
[Pittsburghs] 46,601 people lived in an area of 1130 acres. 
Densities ranged from 66.9 persons per acre to 24.1 persons 
per acre in the outlying and fastest growing wards.
New forms of transportation allowed Pittsburgh to expand 
and become less crowded. The most important new mode 
of transportation, the streetcar, made its first appearance 
in 1859. Tarr wrote, powered initially by horses and mules, 
then by cable, and ultimately by electricity, the streetcar 
dominated urban transport until World War I. Pittsburghs 
first electric trolley line was built in 1890.
Throughout the 19th century, more and more people rode 
trolleys. According to Tarr, Pittsburghs population increased 
from 46,601 to 238,617 by 1890. At the same time, the number 
of people per acre decreased as the city continued to expand - 
outward, in large part due to the trolley. The trolley was a

system left its mark
Philadelphia had 710 miles, and Chicago (the largest) had 
1100 miles of track. Ridership peaked in 1923.
After World War I, the trolley industry faced the Great 
Depression. Lybarger said, "People werent traveling  no 
jobs. Ridership decreased one-half in three years." However, 
World War II came and rejuvenated the trolley industry. Oil 
and tires were needed for the war effort, so cars and buses 
had to be used less. Trolleys, reliant on electricity, became the 
necessary mode of transportation for workers.
The PRCo was in bankruptcy from 1938 to 1951. During those 
years, when the company did not have to pay off debt, it 
generated huge sums of money. PRCo had the opportunity 
to buy new cars, including 465 PCC cars. These trolleys had 
been designed at a conference called by the presidents of 
trolley companies (PCC stands for the Presidents Conference 
Committee) in 1929 to make trolley travel preferable to car 
and bus travel. At one point, PRCo owned 666 PCC cars. 
According to Lybarger's article Quick Overview of Public 
Transit in Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh Engineer's Fall 2005 
edition, "The PCC cars riding qualities, seating comfort, and 
acceleration characteristics (faster than most autos of the day) 
made it an effective competitor.
After World War II ended and America's economy was 
booming, things took a turn for the worse for the trolley 
industry. PRCo came out of bankruptcy in 1951, but the profits 
from the war dissipated immediately. It was also after World 
War II that the automobile conquered the trolley. Before, 
people couldnt afford cars, and even those who could had to 
deal with manufacturing time, as manufacturers could not 
meet demands for the automobile. According to Lybarger, 
cars were readily available by 1949, and he described 
trolley ridership as taking a "nosedive." On top of that, labor 
problems, including a 56-day strike in 1954, alienated a large 
number of riders.
the trolley systems in Allegheny County, including PRCo.
Although you won't see a streetcar running down Forbes 
Avenue anymore, artifacts of the streetcar era remain. The 
cast iron poles used to suspend the electric wires, now 
stripped of purpose, still dot the streetscape past campus, 
and the rusting rails streetcars used to run from downtown 
to Squirrel Hill remain in place, buried under the asphalt and 
making occasional appearances during street resurfacing.
Trolleys have not wholly disappeared. Some cities still 
have small systems that actually use PCC cars. Much more 
common, however, is the light rail system. Pittsburghs 
system, the T, has stations downtown. Light Rail Vehicles 
(LRVs), essentially trolleys with a few modifications, cross over 
the river and stop at Station Square, and then travel outside of 
Pittsburgh.
According to the Port Authoritys website, the 25-mile T 
(which has four overlapping routes) has a daily weekday 
ridership of 27,000. The system has 25 high-platform stops,
43 low-platform stops, and three subway stations (including 
one downtown called Steel Plaza, near the USX Tower). 
Commuters can leave their cars at parking lots by T stations 
and ride the trolley to Pittsburgh. One-way fare at peak 
time is $2.75. The Port Authority plans to extend the T 
through downtown to the North Shore, near the Carnegie 
Science Center. According to a September 9 article in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the goal is a $435 million North 
Shore Connector project, a twin-tunnel extension of the Light 
Rail Transit system under the Allegheny River. It will take an 
estimated 41/2 years to complete the construction.
Riding the T can be entertaining. Starting from the Steel Plaza
downtown, the LRV takes you above the Monongahela 
River on a bridge. From there, the LRV negotiates 
awkward curves in the track and the ups and downs of 
Pittsburgh topography. Several bridges take you high 
above the surrounding area. It's beautiful in the winter 
time, with all the snow and barren trees.
The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum (PTM), in Washington, 
Pa., is about 30 minutes south of Pittsburgh. The 
museum offers a wealth of archival material and photos, 
tours, and a photo exhibit of Pittsburghs trolley system. 
PTM has on display about 40 trolleys and rail vehicles 
from all eras, including 10 to 12 trolleys that are restored 
and operational for four-mile rides. The museum also 
holds the streetcar Desire, which was featured in 
Tennessee Williams play of the same name.
Though trolleys and streetcars are virtually extinct as 
a mode of transportation in Pittsburgh, their presence 
remains strong in some countries  Hungary, for 
instance, boasts the busiest system, while Japan boasts 
one of the most complex and oft-used systems in the 
world. Despite these, most trolley systems throughout 
the world have gone the way of the PRCo and vanished. 
Trolleys and streetcars will, however, live on in the 
hearts of many, at least in the form of Mister Rogers 
Neighborhoods Trolley.
More information, including a full car roster and photos, 
is available at www.pa-trolley.org.
Editors Note: Adam Greenberg contributed to this 
article.
Pittsburgh's city government also played a part in the demise 
of trolleys. Since 1902, there had been a company called the 
Philadelphia Company, which included PRCo, Equitable Gas, 
and Duquesne Light (an electric company still in existence 
today), which was dissolved by city government into 
separate parts in the late 1940s. In 1964, the Port 
Authority of Allegheny County took over operation of

ModCloth.com features retro clothing and accessories complete with interactive sizing chart
Vintage. Indie. Retro. Emo. These are some of the terms 
thrown around by clothing companies to attract young 
adults to their stores. Usually the words just mean pre-faded, 
screen-printed shirts with less-than-clever phrases on them. 
At ModCloth, however, these words accurately describe the 
companys wide variety of stylish clothes. Established and run 
by Carnegie Mellon students and graduates, the distribution 
jCompany has been growing rapidly in popularity across 
America and other countries.
At ModCloth.com, web surfers are greeted by the smiling 
face of Susan Gregg. Wearing a red argyle hoodie dress,
Gregg sets the mood of the light-hearted website that has 
represented the company for four years. The website offers 
mens and womens clothes, shoes, and accessories such as 
sunglasses and bags and receives between 10 and 15 orders 
a day. Though the company does not make its own products, 
the products certainly express a specific mood and style:
The smiling models throughout the site convey a stylish and 
carefree lifestyle. The interactive sizing chart helps customers 
choose the right size to order, ensuring their experience with 
the fashionable products to be a comfortable one.
 -?
Created in early 2002 by Gregg and Eric Koger, ModCloth 
began as a modest vendor of one-of-a-kind items. Gregg was 
a frequent shopper at thrift stores while a high school student 
in Miami, Fla., and took advantage of all the terrific clothes 
that the retirees had unloaded in the shops. Since the prices 
were as cheap as a dollar for a pair of pants, she would end 
up buying anything that she thought looked good, whether 
or not it fit her. With a vast collection of great clothes, Gregg
and Koger, who had been working at a web-consulting firm, 
established ModCloth.com. Working out of Greggs parents 
house, and enlisting her mom to help with shipping, Gregg 
and Koger would prepare the clothes for sale (dry cleaning, 
fixing any tears, taking pictures, and writing descriptions). 
Friends would help by accompanying Gregg on her bargain 
shopping adventures.
In the fall of 2002, Gregg and Koger left Miami and began 
attending Carnegie Mellon, both majoring in business. At the 
end of their first year, the company made $6000. Gregg and 
Koger continued running ModCloth for the next few years, 
sticking with the unique vintage clothing market.
Gregg wears ModCloth "all the time," while Koger describes 
himself as more of a "techy geek than fashionista." The 
models who display the products on the website are also very 
excited about the clothes. Koger and Gregg even ran into one 
of their models wearing ModCloth's Rook and Dove T-shirt as 
the two were meeting at Kiva Han for this article.
In the summer of 2005, they decided to expand their business 
with "reproduction inventory, as Koger put it. The unique, 
clothes, while being very profitable, were becoming a heavy 
burden. Each item needed its own webpage and description, 
but would only be relevant until someone bought it and 
its inventory was sold out. Gregg began looking for small 
designer companies online and in clothing catalogues, to 
buy wholesale clothes to sell through ModCloth. In February, 
Gregg and Koger took a week off from school to travel to Las 
Vegas for the Magic Trade Show. With 10 miles of vendors to
choose from, Gregg and Koger shopped all day and ended up 
working all night, too. They stayed up until 7 a.m. to finish a 
paper for school.
After Gregg graduated this past May (Koger is still working 
towards his MBA), the couple tied the knot and bought a 
house in Friendship. The house is used as ModCloth central, 
with the inventory stocked in the basement and packaging 
and photography taking place throughout the house. Gregg 
and Koger consciously decided to keep the business in house 
in order to maintain a tight-knit atmosphere in the company.
Currently, ModCloth has six employees and many recurring 
models. The website has expanded with the ModLife blog, 
written by business partner Matt Kopel, who graduated 
with a creative writing degree this past spring. ModLife 
provides visitors with frequently updated pop culture news, 
music interviews, and other information and entertainment. 
ModCloth.com receives 1800 visitors every day, 25 percent of 
whom are return visitors. At its current rate, the company will 
make $700,000 in 2007.
In the future, Koger and Gregg plan to revamp the website 
and logo. They also are planning to put together a ModCloth 
catalogue and sell to boutiques in New York. Erin Goldberger, 
a junior English major and ModCloths chief photographer, 
summed up the bright future for the company confidently 
with, It's gonna be big. You can quote me on that.

Now a junior Creative Writing major, 
Linguistics minor, Jon Samuels is 
probably his greatest critic in regards 
to his lack of artistic talent {look. 
he cant even draw his own glasses!)
"S His inspiration for his
J comic All Hail the Jon, in which
he plays the central role, comes 
from things he observes about 
daily life, the universe, 
and everything.
His love of coffee is 
another of hfs inspirations, 
as nearly all of his AHTJ 
comic strips feature the 
wonderful beverage.
