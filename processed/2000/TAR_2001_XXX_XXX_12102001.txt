CMU murderer 
at large; police 
unconcerned
by Willie Layer
Professional Player
University students continue to 
reel from a recent series of brutal 
murders on campus. As of print 
deadline, 23 students have been 
reported dead, with nine more 
reported missing. Bodies of blud
geoned and dismembered students 
have been found in dorm rooms, 
academic buildings, on the Cut, 
and attached to electric motors 
hanging from trees lining the side
walks and spinning to a back
ground of techno beats.
Campus Police have struggled to 
begin an investigation into the 
attacks, citing bureaucratic hold
ups and department-wide incompe
tence as the reasons for the delay.
Til admit the investigation has 
taken a little longer than planned, 
said Campus Police Chief Barney 
Fife, who initiated the investigation 
22 days ago. Currently, the entire 
police force is working to compile a 
crime alert to let students know 
that there may be a possible serial 
killer on campus.
The campus was virtually desert
ed following the first of the bloody 
attacks last month. Theres no way 
in hell Im leaving my room, said 
sophomore Bernard Conoway. I 
mean, I thought that one killing 
was bad, but now, the bodies are 
piling up and I just dont feel safe 
walking around campus.
The majority of students are 
reportedly holed up in their dormi
tories and the E-tTwer of Redwood 
Hall has been barricaded by a 
group of approximately 300 panicstricken first-years. Campus police

Prostitution discovered 
at University frat house
by Eileen Dover
Spiritual Counselor
In a shocking Saturday night 
police raid, members of the offcampus fraternity Alpha Sigma 
Sigma (ASS) were charged 
with running a prostitution 
ring out of their Dealer Street 
house. At least 10 members 
faced charges of illegal busi
ness practices, solicitation of 
minors, and sodomy.
The raid occurred at 3 am 
during the height of the 
evenings activity at the ASS 
house, dubbed by Dealer Street 
neighbors as the Carnage 
Whorehouse. Along with 13 
fraternity members, approxi
mately 15 prostitutes and 12 
exotic dancers were escorted
from the house by city police 
officers.
What the hell is going on 
here? exclaimed a city police 
officer in disbelief after forcing 
ASS president Dan DevilDogg Rumawatz into a police 
cruiser. I know that CMU 
administrators are pretty lax 
with the rules for frats, but Im 
surprised that Greek-sponsored 
whorehouses are allowed to 
slide.
The discovery of the fraterni
tys illegal dealings occurred by 
accident after city police offi
cers arrived at the Dealer 
Street ASS house to investigate 
a noise complaint.
I cant believe it took police 
this long to figure things out, 
said one sophomore CS major

TO DISMAY OF CMU DRAMATS, 
EAT N PARK GIVEN PURNELL
Eat n Park not only revamped CMUs food service, but public image as well. The new Pukenell Center signage

Corporate Whore
Miss Highlander? Cant decide 
between the greasy fries at the 
0and the watery salsa at Si Senor? 
Well, fret no longer. As of next year, 
all of your dining problems will be 
laid to rest by a savior with a big smil
ing face.
Thats right, in just a few 
short months, all eating facili
ties on campus will be replaced 
by Eat n Park restaurants. We 
felt it was a perfect move, said 
one Eat n Park representative. 
We expect to double our cur
rent profits on smiley face cook
ies alone.
The change comes as a relief to 
those who can no longer stomach the 
amazing variety offered by the cur
rent dining vendors on campus. 
There are too many choices in what 
kind of crap you can eat on campus 
now. Itll be nice to have just one con
sistent source of crap from now on, 
professional student Fred Katt said.
Conversely, the change comes as a 
shock to absolutely no one. Ive 
been here for two and a half years 
and seen 25 different vendors in the
toxicology major Tubb Alard. Im 
halfway done with my doctoral the
sis already, and the new Eat n Parks 
ought to push me over the top.
The most noticeable change to the 
campus will be the replacement of 
the electronic billboard on the 
Pukenell Center with a large Eat n 
Park logo. Preliminary test screen
ings show that the new sign should 
be generally well received by stu
dents. It actually looks better to me, 
Alard said. Besides, anything to get 
rid of the poem of the week. Those 
writers depress the hell out of me. 
While there was some opposition 
to changing the sign, Eat n Park rep
resentatives handled the discussion 
quickly and effectively by throwing 
more money at the objectors until 
they shut up. The official reason for 
the change was to increase the 
advertising capabilities of the new 
location. Well, you didnt expect us 
to cater to just the students, did 
you? said an Eat n Park representa
tive. We needed an Oakland loca
tion to complement our outlet in 
Squirrel Hill, and this opening was 
too good to pass up.
Perhaps the most surprising aspect 
of the change is that all current ven
dor locations will remain in use, 
including the trucks next to Posner 
Hall. Were trying to keep the 
change as low-key as possible, said 
the representative. Aside from the 
sign on Pukenell, were not making 
any outward changes, and we figure 
that a good two-thirds of the student 
population wont even notice a differ
ence in most of the locations.
Keeping all of the existing vendor 
locations open should keep business 
booming by maintaining the appear
ance of competition. Well sell each 
section of our menu at a different 
location, so they look like a different 
restaurant. That way, when students 
get tired of one option, theyre still 
buying from us when they switch to 
something new. Plus, we can tax 
appetizers, entrees, and desserts sep
arately, a representative said.
Overall, the change means little to 
the general living conditions on cam
pus, and will likely be received with 
the apathetic malaise which general
ly greets important developments at 
the University. Though the contract 
specifies a lease of five years for Eat 
n Park, University officials are 
already looking into possible 
replacements for the start of the 
spring semester.

In a pre-dawn raid, the 
refugee camp by the Fence was 
stormed by commandos in mili
tary fatigues last Friday. The 
joint coalition of soldiers was led 
by the Belgian army in what 
Prime Minister Jaques Robedieux 
called One of the greatest 
moments for the people of 
Belgium. Also participating in 
the raid were the armies of the 
Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, 
Andorra, and Canada.
In an eleventh-hour resolution 
last night, the United Nations 
decided that immediate action 
was necessary for reasons of 
planetary security. Coffee 
Anon, Secretary General of the 
UN, said, I saw a movie this 
weekend and there was a pre

directly during the trailer and 
told me that there were aliens at 
CMU. Anon took the informa
tion back to UN headquarters 
and the Belgian Ambassador 
known only as X offered his 
countrys military currently 
composed of 11 people  to help 
in the operation.

knitting an afghan, groups of stu

They need some Tech pride. 
Yeah, thats what they need, 
said Willy Dancing Irish Boy 
Helliott, VP of Nothing Important 
as he chowed down on a chili 
dog. My heart is in the work. 
Helliott said that he would be 
deploying his squad of highly 
trained Campus Police to the 
refugee camp to help keep the 
peace.
I just want to get hot and 
horny, said Butch, Campus 
Police Detective. I got me some 
good opium off
misc. grocery store Thats all 
Butch really said. He didnt seem 
very interested in keeping the 
peace. Helliott seemed to agree.
Yeah. Ever since we gave him 
that badge, he thinks hes some 
sort of goddam Don Juan, said 
Helliott as he finished off a plate 
of nachos with extra chili and 
cheese. Helliott said that Butch
would be useful in the refugee 
camp detail because, he knows 
his shit.
According to wire reports, the 
refugees were aware of the 
impending attack, as they 
received intelligence reports 
from their leader. However 
aware the refugees were, noth
ing could prepare them for the 
fury of the Belgian army Armed 
with chocolate icing guns and 
petite madelines the Belgian 
army caused havoc in the refugee 
camp. Surprisingly, not a single 
piece of traditional weaponry 
was needed in the raid.
According to Jean-Paul JeanPaul, the soldiers simply set up a 
small card table with a few fold
ing chairs and began to eat their 
Belgian pastries. The refugees 
were forced into submission as 
the officers threw scraps of 
Belgian waffles in the direction 
of the refugees, who needed 
something to wash down with 
their venti-sized Starbucks coffee 
(whatever the hell that means  
I think it means large here in 
America).
Anyway, the refugees packed it 
up and headed back to the clus
ter. What relief. What a relief, 
said Colon.

In an unprecedented act of 
inconsideration, Parking Services 
decided to start new construction 
on Tuesday at the East Campus 
Garage. To complete the imple

closed more entrances and exits 
to the parking garage. In fact, 
they closed all of them.

construction, and if they didnt

GOVERNOR SCHWAGGER APPOINTS 
SON BRIAN NEW PA LT. GOVERNOR
by Ima Buttmunch
Drug Dealer
In a move sure to send shockwaves across Toastmasters clubs 
from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania Governor Mark 
Schwagger appointed his son and 
Carnage Mellon student Brain 
Schwagger, to the position of 
Lieutenant Governor.
Im very excited about the 
challenge to make the 
Commonwealth a top-notch 
state, said Schwagger who 
offered up many pearls of wis
dom at his nomination ceremony 
held in Doherty Hall 2210.
Schwagger brings a wealth of 
second-in-line experience to the 
position. As Stupid Body Vice 
President, Schwagger spent a 
great deal of his time at CMU cut
ting ribbons for new Dining 
Services menu items and eulogiz
ing the extended CMU family at 
University funerals.
At CMU, Schwagger was noted 
for his strong work ethic and dig
nity. He holds the CMU records 
for longest time without untuck
ing his shirt and performing his 
duties as a Stupid Senator while 
sober. He also served as the Vice 
President of the CMU chapter of 
the Hair Club for Men.
My son, err, Brain is an 
extremely talented person with 
the humble and straight-laced 
qualities to make the Lieutenant 
Governor position as irrelevant 
as ever. Hes as real-deal as they 
get, said Gov. Schwagger.
While the younger 
Schwaggers appointment was 
hailed as a bipartisan victory in 
the states political circles, 
Stupid Senate officials were 
openly disgruntled.Brain was so 
formal and stuff. Im just glad his 
reign of terror is over, said 
Stupid Senate chair Kitty 
Kielbassa.
Schwagger may best be 
remembered for a rousing speech
given to University roustabouts, 
malcontents, and do-nothings at 
the fence. Schwagger threw cau
tion to the wind when he 
addressed a gathering of nearly 
20 students on the subject of 
estate planning in the new mil
lennium.
Im here to tell you that I think 
living is better than dying, bel
lowed a stern Schwagger at the 
gathering.
At press time, pundits were 
confused as to the effect the deci
sion might have on current 
Stupid Body President Stone 
Harbors plans for reelection.
Well I think you need to 
understand the circumstances 
surrounding the case. In 1983, 
this University was in shambles 
and there were a lot of debtors 
clamoring for a CMU shutdown. 
Therefore, Harbor may take the 
path less traveled or Plan B, said 
an utterly befuddling Dean of 
Criminal Courts Mic Double M 
OMurphy.
Whorehouse found on campus. Is it a 
good thing? Some might say yes, it is!

who frequented the popular ASS 
weekend parties. I mean, every
body at CMU knows about this 
place ... I guess from all the fliers 
around campus and stuff.
The ASS prostitution ring has 
apparently been in full operation 
since last spring, when the frater
nity was kicked off campus for its 
involvement in an international 
cocaine smuggling deal. At that 
time, University administrators 
suggested that ASS take a 
break from campus life for a 
year, promising to put them up in 
a spacious 3-story house on 
Dealer Street in the meantime. 
The criminal masterminds of ASS 
quickly formulated a new 
scheme, and began soliciting dis
enchanted drama majors to live 
in their house and entertain 
both fraternity members and 
paying customers. By the begin
ning of the fall semester, the ASS 
fraternity house had gained citywide recognition as a den of 
sin.
All sorts of crazy shit has been 
going down over there, said 
CMU senior Ted Kazinsky, who 
lives in an apartment across the 
street from ASS. Not only was 
there an almost constant stream 
of traffic pulling up in front of 
the house to pick up whores, but 
I swear to God that they were 
filming pornos on the front lawn 
a couple of times.
I had thought they were going 
to get busted a few nights ago 
when Campus Police showed up, 
but I guess they were there for 
other reasons, if you know what I 
mean.
The ASS president adamantly 
denied the fraternitys involve
ment in the prostitution ring. 
You have to understand that the 
only ASS members involved in 
these illegal activities had gradu
ated a couple of years ago, even 
though they were still living in 
our house. The rest of the fraternity members had absolutely no 
idea what was going on. Honest. 
Murphy Mitchell, dean of 
Student Affairs, expressed confu
sion about ASSs most recent 
legal entanglement.I cannot 
comment extensively about the 
allegations against ASS, because 
frankly, I do not know anything 
about them. However, with the 
exemplary leadership found 
within the ASS fraternity, I know 
we will quickly clear up what is 
sure to only be a small misunder
standing.
After seizing extensive clien
tele records, photographs, sexual 
props, costumes, snuff films, and 
other incriminating evidence 
from the ASS house during the 
raid, city police say that fraterni
ty members will face felony 
charges.
ASS members remain opti
mistic, claiming that they plan to 
proceed with a campus-wide 
food drive next weekend. It will 
be amazing.

COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS 
LIKE NEW WEEN DORM IDEA
by Rufus Leaking
Local Commedian
Housing has recently 
announced that, beginning in fall 
of the 2002 school year, the over
flow of computer science and 
architecture students will start 
being assigned housing within 
academic buildings. Students 
who join the College of Computer 
Science and do not return their 
housing forms promptly will be 
given housing in the computer 
clusters.
Critical to the success of this 
new strategy is input from incom
ing first-years. Recently, a Natrat 
reporter was able to interview 
one such prospective student and 
inquire about his opinion regard
ing the change in Housing policy. 
Prospective computer science stu
dent Wiley Forlup, said I actual
ly like the way theyre doing 
things. In fact, Im not returning 
my Housing form so my chances 
of being placed in the cluster are 
better. Its gonna be great! 
Interviews with less coherent
incoming computer science firstyears yielded unmistakably excit
ed phrases about linked lists 
and something about bases 
belonging to someone. Whatever 
the intended messages, it seems 
clear that future classes of CS stu
dents will be spending even less 
time outside of the clusters.
Modifications to the clusters 
and surrounding areas will 
include shower stalls in each 
bathroom of Ween Hall and the 
conversion of Ween 7500 into 
barracks-style bunk bedding. 
This will allow students a quick, 
32.6 second commute from bed 
to monitor. Students will be able 
to displace the older, plain work
stations with their own soupedup polygon-pushing powerhous
es. Lounge furniture will be 
placed in the top three floors of 
the building as well to facilitate 
socialization and encourage the 
making of friends. Some issues, 
such as coed living, have been 
raised and presented to Housing. 
In response to such concerns, the 
department issued the following 
statement: Due to the nature of
the average incoming computer 
science student, we at Housing" 
Services feel little need to set 
boundaries of gender in a popula
tion that has them inherently 
built in.
Housing is implementing a , 
similar strategy for architecture 
students, planning to relocate 
those who are without housing 
into the studios. Plans are in - 
motion to expand on the already  
present system of cots and sleeping niches that dot the various - 
architecture studios. To provide 
the rest of the necessary sleeping 
facilities, all wood shop instruc
tors will plan their curriculum 
around making lofts and bunk 
beds.
Another long-term Housing 
plan currently being considered 
includes the formation of a 
humanities - themed campsite 
outside of Baker Hall. With 
implementation planned for fall 
of 2003, students in H&SS will be 
provided with tents and blankets 
upon arrival at the University and 
asked to partake in a four-year 
experiment in roughing it.

officers have made repeated 
attempts to gain access to the 
tower, to no avail.
We just want to tell these stu
dents that they're going to be okay. 
There is no, and I stress absolutely 
no, need for panic, said Fife, 
adding that officers have decided 
to take a wait and see approach on 
both the E tower situation and the 
continuing campus carnage.
University officials have been 
quick to offer reassurance to stu
dents. Whats important to 
remember here is that we dont 
really know what is going on, said 
Murphy Mitchel, dean of Student 
Affairs. All I can say is that there 
have been some possible  and I 
stress possible  murders. 
Students may question the lack of 
information provided to them 
about these incidents, but I really 
dont understand the need to 
divulge details that might allow 
students to save their lives. 
President Gerard Colon was 
unavailable for comment about the 
campus murders, but aides report 
that he has taken steps to put 
together a student advisory com
mittee to assess the situation. On 
Thursday, he released a written 
statement from his secure bunker 
beneath the city streets encourag
ing students to attend his bi-month
ly office hours to discuss anything 
that might be bothering them. 
Some students are questioning 
their future at the University, and at 
least 20 students have withdrawn 
their enrollment for the semester. 
Im outta here, said senior Carrie 
Felix as she packed her car in front 
of Smudge Hall yesterday after
noon. Three people in this dorm 
have been reported missing in the 
last week and the burnt remains of 
another one were found behind the 
building this morning. I just cant

Despite the presence of a bloodmoney in meters at metered

Unfortunately, all pedestrian 
entrances and exits to the 
garage have also been blockad
ed. Asked how students and 
faculty members are to attend 
to their meter obligations with 
no way of entering the garage, 
a parking official shrugged and 
said, There are smart people 
around here. Theyll figure 
something out.
Reporters asked a professor 
who regularly parks in the 
garage what he plans to do 
about parking for the next sev
eral months. His abrupt 
response was I dont read the 
Natrat. Go away

thirsty killer on campus, Chief Fife 
has encouraged students to resume 
their normal activities. No one 
needs to take any more safety pre
cautions than usual, said Fife. 
The number of officers on bike 
patrol has been increased to one, 
and I firmly believe that this spo
radic presence of police authority 
on campus will make the perpetra
tor think twice before stabbing or 
axing to death another innocent 
student.
To further set students minds at 
ease, Fife has begun conducting 
kickboxing classes in Tangos Hall 
each afternoon.
Im learning some neat karate 
tricks from Chief Fife, but I dont 
really think this is going to protect 
me from someone who wants to 
slit my throat before dismember
ing me and strewing my innards 
across Forbes Avenue, said senior 
Sharleena Jones, referring to the 
Friday death of a student tenta
tively identified as junior Kyle 
Kermit.
Fife explained that the criminal 
investigation is currently being 
conducted exclusively by Campus 
Police. We really dont feel the 
need to bother city police with 
these incidents, although I have to 
admit Im not entirely sure what 
the proper procedure is for murder

We Must Stop the Muddiness
Yesterday, several students' stepped 
on the muddy ground, and dirtied 
their shoes. Their mommies spanked 
them. Decidedly, this must stop. 
Carnage Melon must take important 
steps to eliminate the presence of cam
pus mud, a prominent sink for the 
morale and motivation that inevitably 
drains from students as each semester 
wears on.
In addition, campus mud deters
potential incoming first-years, and 
leaves a bad impression, not to men
tion a little mud, on these students. 
This is unacceptable.
To recitify this intolerable condition, 
campus officials need to hurry up and 
finish the process of eliminating all 
open areas on campus. I mean, come 
on, theres only about four square feet 
of land not covered in concrete right 
now, so lets hurry up and get rid of it.
Anti-Pigeon Measures a Godsend
For too long, public buildings have 
been at the mercy of roosting pigeons 
and other foul fowls who litter any 
open space they find with things like 
nests, eggs, and baby birds.
Thank God that the architect respon
sible for the UC and Pukenell took this 
tragedy into consideration and put in 
anti-pigeon measures on the two new 
buildings.
For those of you who may be 
unaware of the measures in place to 
protect your delicate ears from the hor
rendous screeching of the wonder of 
life, there are foot-long, razor sharp 
spikes on the eaves under the covered 
walkways next to the two buildings to 
savagely mutilate any creature, feath
ered or otherwise, foolish enough to 
attempt to make a home where the tree 
it used to live in once was.
These tools of muder and torture, 
clearly visible from the second floor of 
either building, mar an otherwise 
unremarkable overhang that has no 
point for existing.
Apparently, the architect felt the 
need to put in a completely unneccesary eave and then spend even more 
money to protect it rather than just put 
a solid wall. For this blatent waste of 
time, money, and effort, we applaud 
the University planners.
Obviously part of the Master Scam 
proposed by President Colon, this inef
ficiency is just what the campus has 
been missing over the past few years.
Furthermore, the torture and possi
ble death of innocent creatures is an 
added bonus that adds just the right 
amount of evil to the Master Scam. 
We can only hope for even more such 
acts in the future.
In the hope of harming as much of 
mother nature as humanly possible, we 
propose the following measures to be 
enacted around campus:
Bear traps around Whorewood 
Gardens: The cute bunny rabbits that 
hop around the walkway leading into 
Whorewood have had their way long 
enough. We need to teach those fuck
ers a lesson, and oversized bear traps 
will be just the thing to do it.
Acid rain generators evenly spaced 
around campus: The environmentalist 
fad of the 80s, acid rain, has all but dis
appeared from the landscape lately, 
and its time to bring it back. Not only 
will this prevent students from wasting 
valuable study time by going outside, it 
will kill the grass in the Mall much 
more effectively than the Orientation 
Tent.
With these mechanisms in place, the 
campus will be much more effective at 
churning out mindless automatons 
with no social skills or regard for other 
lifeforms of any sort, human or other
wise.
Stupid Senate Must be Destroyed
Call me old fashioned, but whats up 
with this whole democracy thing? Who 
are we to trust our rights and privileges 
to the whim of just a few elected offi
cials? The Natrat hereby officially 
calls for the dissolution of Stupid 
Senate.
To replace our ineffectual leaders, 
we propose a communist tribunal in 
the grand tradition of Joseph Stalin. 
True to form, all existing government 
officials will be purged with extreme 
prejudice. Those who attempt to flee 
will be hunted like the dogs they are 
and burned at the stake. Any officials 
who capitulate to our demands will 
receive the mercy of being hurled off of 
the Panther Hollow Bridge.
Rise up, our proletariat brothers and 
sisters! Break free from the capitalist 
chains which bind you into servitude at 
the beck and call of your heartless mas
ters.
Our agents have already infiltrated a 
number of key positions within the 
Stupid Senate itself. We await only the
signal from the downtrodden masses 
to rise up and strike like a hidden 
cobra, freeing us all from the living hell 
we find ourselves imprisoned in.
Only together can we rid ourselves of

Letters to the Editor
My scooter is gone!
Your Majesty,
On September 17 around 5:38 pm, it 
was a sad, sad day for our campus. As I 
left Hammershag Hall, I walked over to a 
bush where I had hidden my scooter an 
hour earlier. I didnt lock it, but I thought 
the bush was a really good hiding spot.
It is imperative that I find my scooter; 
its bling-blingin. Please help me. Heres 
how strongly I feel about my scooter...
The scooter does the trick, for a lazy ass 
like me who doesnt feel like riding the 
PAT bus from Shadyside to school, or 
fronting quarters for parking. Mine is 
electric, I got it new off ebay for $45. The 
only (and major problem) with it is that it 
has a lot of maintenance problems, main
ly due to cheap, foreign-made tires. 
Before, I used to have to patch the tubes
every day!! They would always pop, but 
then I found out if I adjust my riding style, 
meaning that I ride more carefully and 
not go on curbs and bumps, the tires 
would not blow out as often.
By the way, fixing the scooter takes 
about an hour and 15 seconds. I bring a 
tool kit with me at all times, complete 
with wrenches, screw drivers, a patch kit, 
and even a pump just in case it breaks 
down on campus and I cant get home. 
The damn thing weighs about 400 pounds 
so its a pain in the ass to carry up and 
down stairs but I would do anything for 
my baby.
It is a great investment, and I miss it 
dearly. If I were to make a decision analy
sis model to estimate its value, it would 
probably come out to be negative 612 
cents since it has constantly been break
ing down. However, I do love it when it 
DOESNT break down. Hell, I love it even 
when it does. It gets me from the heart of
Shadyside to the heart of campus in 10 
minutes and 22 seconds. In addition, I 
save $23.17 on parking, and I can get to 
one class to another in no time.
I dont' know if you have seen me doing 
this, but I ride my scooter indoors as well. 
This could only happen since I am riding 
an electric one, which doesnt make too 
much noise. I have not received any com
plaints yet. (Though a cop or two has 
yelled at me here and there.) I also have 
also not hit anyone too hard. There have 
been some close calls, but my scootering 
skills are improving.
If you are thinking of getting one, go for 
it. Just give mine back ... NOW. I will be 
looking behind every bush, tree, and 
shrub until I find it. Please bring my baby 
home.

In my opinion, man, you gotta do a little 
smoking. Yeah. Smoke a lot of shit man!
Joe Schmo
Dude, if I hear one more 
person bragging about how 
much work he has or how long 
its been since she slept, Im 
gonna scream.
You know what Im gonna 
scream?
SMOKE SOME POT AND 
CHILL OUT!
Well, I wouldnt really 
scream. Potheads dont 
scream. But we could sit on 
the benches by the Fence and 
smoke a bowl and talk about 
the Green Movement.
The Green Movement is 
long overdue at Carnegie 
Mellon. This is a movement to 
integrate marijuana onto the 
CMU campus, among faculty, 
staff, and most importantly, 
students.
Heres the deal. While I was 
toking and writing a paper, I 
figured out how to relax the 
overly stressed student body, 
reward our professors for pre
tending to believe us when we 
say were too sick to come to 
class, and to thank the campus
employees just because theyre 
awesome. Man, Im telling 
you, a Greener campus, that is 
the answer!
So think about it. We have a 
lovely campus, especially for 
toking. There are buildings to 
climb, grass to lay on, and 
even strategically placed 
benches for people watching 
(a pothead favorite).
The names of the buildings 
on campus are all set to be
changed to support the Green 
Movement. For example, 
Baker already has an appro
priate name. Well, maybe 
Bake Her Hall is more specific. 
Wean Hall would be Weed 
Hall, Doherty Hall would be 
Doperty, Hunt Libray would 
be Hemp Library. And of 
course, Hamerschlag, also 
known as Schlag Hall, would 
be Schwag Hall. Dude, thats 
pretty dope, I never noticed
how cool the names of campus 
buildings are.
Anyway, like I was saying... 
wait, what was I talking about?
Oh yeah. The Green 
Movement. So yeah, we got 
the noble cause. We got a 
sweet place to launch it (our 
school). Now heres the heart 
of the matter: you.
But wait dude! Before you 
roll your eyes and stop reading

Having not much else to do besides 
deconstruct dead white male literature, 
smoke some dope, and figure out new 
ways to get laid, it seems that H and Best 
Guess majors love to spend the rest of 
their free time complaining about the 
whereabouts of one Gerard Colon. 
Between the 3:30 pm class they all have 
(the only one, mind you) and the $1 flicks 
on campus, they whine and complain 
about his lack of presence.
Why they do this is beyond me. The 
man is nothing more than a front, a tool if 
you will, of radical Islamic terrorist Akim 
Mohammed Mulah al Wahid, otherwise 
known as one Dean Mikhail Smurphy.
Now normally Id point out that what a 
great job Colon is doing (at least as a 
cover man for you-know-who), but it
seems the sex-and-debauchery tabloid 
that I usually write for has been shut 
down. My sources tell me it has some
thing to do with my editor and her pen
chant for diet Coke, Mel Gibson movies, 
taffy, intact donkeys and some missing 
funds. Luckily, this fine paper, carrying on 
the tradition of such journalistic power
houses as the Student Union and The 
Phoenix, has given me an open forum to 
discuss what I feel is a solution to all our 
problems.
Sent like an angel from above, the 
answer to Colon, Smurphy, enrollment, 
Carnage Mellons endowment, and the 
war on terrorism, is none other than MCS 
sophomore Elissa-Beth Copenhagen.
Beth (if I may be so bold as to call her 
that) is using her womanly ways to win a 
spot as a VJ for the winter Olympics. Now, 
the two or three people who know what a 
VJ may skip the next paragraph.
Still reading? Then you must be asking, 
Whats a VJ? No, its not a sexual act nor
a disease you get from a sexual act. 
Rather, a VJ is a Video Jockey. You see, 
once upon a time, many moons ago, in a 
country not too far away, there was a 
cable channel called MTV, or Music 
Television. This channel played videos. 
These were short films set to popular 
music by bands like Dire Straights, The 
Police, and A-ha!
VJs were people who knew a little 
about music and would introduce these 
videos. Martha was the best. Oh, the 
things I imagined doing with her ... but I 
digress.
Unfortunately, all good things come to 
an end. The innocence of childhood is 
lost, love is betrayed, death takes our 
loved ones, and MTV started to suck 
worse than a $5 Canadian prostitute 
walking the 401.
Now VJs dont do much except say 
things like Give it for up.... and Britney 
Spears is like, totally, the next Madonna!

4THE MATHAT  DECEMBER 10, 2001
Smoke some stuff: do well in school!
SMOKE, from 3
this and head back to the cluster, 
hear this: You can still get good 
grades while supporting the Green 
Movement!
You can interpret this in a few 
ways, but seriously, these are tried 
and true theories! Like, it can moti
vate you to get your work done 
quicker and more efficiently so you 
can go toke. One active supporter 
of the Green Movement said that 
her freshman year, she had a 3.5 
first semester and a 3.8 second 
semester. Fall of her sophomore 
year she joined the Green 
Movement and has had a perfect 
4.0 ever since! Pretty sweet, huh? 
Better time management and better 
times!
In time, seasoned supporters of
the Green Movement have found 
that you can even be a functional 
toker. Its cool. You are nice and 
mellow from a joint outside 
Schwag Hall, then go inside and do 
your programming. You will be 
amazed by how focused you are 
and how utterly fascinating every
thing is! Begone,boringness! Your 
studies have never been so interest
ing! You will find that eventually 
you can do anything  work, work
out, go to class, even run a meet
ing! (I understand, were CMU 
people, we cant just smoke and sit 
around.)
But most importantly, you dudes 
will chill out! Were all worka
holics, we cant help it, especially 
this time of year. Now, more than 
ever, we all gotta step up and sup
port the Green Movement! Instead 
of meeting your professor in his 
office, why not step outside and 
chat over a joint?
While youre supporting the 
Green Movement, I guarantee that 
you will meet new people. Toking 
brings together all types of people 
 engineers and artists, program
mers and poets, hippies and ath
letes. Everyone says that CMU is all 
about diversity and breaking down 
the cliques, so heres your ticket! 
Over a bong, differences dissolve, 
tongues loosen, and shoulders 
relax. You talk about lots of stuff. 
Keep a journal to record what you 
say. Its pretty cool to read later.
So yeah. In the words of Bob 
Dylan, everybody must get stoned. 
See you at Bake Her!

VJ, from page 3 
(The astute observer 
knows this last claim 
will only be true when 
she stars in bad 
movies and jumps 
Sean Penns bones. 
Looks like shes 
halfway there.) The 
winner of the competi
tion to be VJ for the 
winter Olympics will 
get to report on the 
games and participate 
in crazy stunts. Im 
sure in-depth analysis 
will include state
ments like, Those 
speed skaters uni
forms are phat and 
leave nothing to the 
imagination!
The bright spot in 
all this, of course, is 
lovely Beth. With her 
charm, wit, and, well, 
assets, shes running a 
competitive campaign 
to win. And that 
brings me to the solu
tion to all our prob
lems: Lets all vote for 
Beth so she wins and 
then install her as 
President of the 
University.
Think of the possi
bilities! President 
Copenhagen would 
push endowments 
(hers and Carnage 
Melons) through the 
roof, especially when 
soliciting money from 
all those male alumni 
thinking of all the 
things theyd do with
her ... but we all 
digress.
Given her multifac
eted chemistry/business/drama/VJ/Olym 
pic skills, she could 
finally build an 
alliance to purge 
Smurphy and his evil 
henchmen from the 
bowels of whatever 
building where he 
stores his alien cryo
genic storage chamber 
for regeneration. Shes 
into kickboxing, so 
maybe she could do 
some cool Matrix-like 
fight scenes with 
Agent Smurphy. Of 
course, hed have to 
kill her master first so 
she can be full of 
revenge. I just hope 
she comes up with 
good one-liners like, 
Smurphy, its time for 
your dissertation ... in 
pain!
Shed also boost 
enrollment to unseen 
levels. Instead of bor
ing brochures that 
discuss chemical 
engineering, robot
ics, drama, and paint
ing the fence, we 
could have a Playboy 
spread of Beth. If 
thats too risqu, per
haps a slick video 
production with 
heavy rotation on 
MTV would work. 
She could also co
host biotechnology 
conferences with
Pink and Staind.
To increase student 
interaction with facul
ty she could start a 
TRL (Total Request 
Live for you people 
over 29 years of age) 
show in DH 2210. 
Carson could have 
contests where young 
female freshmen 
could win dream dates 
with their dreamy for
eign TAs who hardly 
speak a word of 
English. President 
Copenhagen could 
help pick the winner 
by counting to the 
highest number she 
can think of. The 
social security/stu
dent ID closet to that 
wins.
I dont know about 
you, but Im so excit
ed, all I can say, Word 
to your mother! So 
get out there, go 
online, and vote 
for Elissa-Beth
Copenhagen as a VJ 
for the winter 
Olympics. Youd be 
doing yourself, 
Carnage Melon, and 
the United States a 
great service.

LECKNER DEFECTS TO D-I NOTRE DAME FOR BIG BUCKS
Kiltie Band makes short work Commentator Pat Summerall of UAA sad-sack Case Western plans to return to NFL as kicker
Wow. Case really fucking sucks.
by Clubber Lang
Heavyweight Champion of the 
World
Why follow a simple marching 
pattern when you can run a 30- 
yard post pattern? Last Saturday, 
for the first time ever, the Kiltie 
Band got to perform beyond just 
their normal halftime show.
In an effort to inject some life 
into an otherwise tired and stale 
match-up, the Kiltie Band took to 
the field in place of the regular 
football team for last weekends 
game against Case Western 
Reserve. We just felt it was time 
for a change, said senior trombon
ist/quarterback Ian Foney. After 
watching as many games as we 
have, you cant help but want to 
take a few cracks at somebody.
Naturally, the Spartans were the 
logical choice, being the perennial 
doormats of the UAA conference. 
Honestly, we didnt even notice 
the difference, one Case player 
admitted. Since none of us know 
what real football players should 
look like, its hard to tell.
For this afternoon, at least, even 
college football fanatics would 
have been hard-pressed to tell the 
Kilties from a real squad. Even with 
just a single week of practice under
their belts, the band looked crisp 
and sure. Do you have any idea 
how many songs and marching pat
terns we have to remember? 
Foney said. After all that, keeping 
a few plays straight is cake. And in 
the end, how hard is it to catch the 
ball and tackle somebody?
As the Spartans found out once 
again, those two tasks can be very 
challenging indeed. Playing down 
to their usual standards, Case 
looked far more out of place than 
the band for most of the game. 
With Foney leading the way, the 
Kilties rolled to 365 yards in the 
first half alone, with junior percus
sionist/tailback Ken McNight 
accounting for 156 on the ground.
The Kilties showed a distinct 
knack for finishing off their drives 
as well, piling up 38 points after 
two quarters. Settling for that one 
field goal was pretty disappoint
ing, Foney said. Not to be outdone, 
the defense showed almost com
plete mastery of the Spartans as 
well. The first half saw the Kilties 
force five turnovers and return one 
for touchdown to make the score 
45-0 at the break.
The second half was more of the 
same, as the Spartans were unable 
to mount a serious threat until well 
after garbage time had set in. That 
late touchdown really hurt,
McNight said. I knew we were 
going too far when we let the flag 
corps play in the secondary.
Regardless of the late score by 
Case, the Kilties remained in com
plete control throughout the game, 
pushing the final score to 73-7. 
Ive only seen scores like that in 
video games, one observer said.
Given the outcome of the game, 
the question was raised of whether 
the band would be given the oppor
tunity to fill in on a more regular 
basis. Opinions were mixed, but 
the majority of fans were skeptical 
of the Kilties chances against real 
competition.
Sure they looked good against 
Case; who wouldnt? said one 
CMU undergrad.
Those sentiments were echoed 
by several of the older fans in atten
dance, as well. One proud parent 
added, Honestly, my 12-year-olds 
pee-wee team could have beaten 
those guys. The spread may have 
been smaller, but the result would 
be the same.
Whether or not the band ever 
gets a second chance on the field, 
no one can take away the experi
ences from this one. Id like a 
chance to prove this wasnt a fluke, 
sure, McNight said. But if we only 
get this one shot, it sure was a good 
one.

Fox Televisions George Allen 
Summerall, known to football fans 
around the world as Pat 
Summerall, announced during 
Sundays football telecast that he 
will be returning to football as a 
place kicker next week.
John Maddens partner in the 
broadcast booth since 1981 had 
contemplated leaving his play-byplay role at Fox to return to the 
NFL after a successful knee 
replacement operation in 2000, 
and Summerall made the official 
announcement at a post-game 
press conference.
I am returning as a player to the 
game I love, said Summerall, 71 
years young. Among teams expect
ed to be interested in Summeralls 
services are the Cincinnati 
Bengals, Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville 
Jaguars, and Green Bay Packers, 
all of whom suck at kicking.
Summeralls NFL career began 
in Detroit in 1952, when he played 
two games for the Lions. He 
played the next five years for the 
Chicago Cardinals, scoring 250 
points. However, team ownership 
realized that there are no cardi
nals in Chicago, and the team relo
cated to the much more appropri
ate city of Phoenix. Summerall fin
ished out his career in the Big 
Apple, scoring 313 points in four 
seasons with the Giants from 1958 
through 1961.
For his career, Summerall con
nected on 47.2 percent of his field
goal attempts, a figure that ranks 
him as the 105th most accurate 
kicker in NFL history (out of 108 
total players with a minimum of 
100 attempts). Summerall won 
one NFL championship with 
Detroit and later lost three cham
pionship games with the Giants, 
including the Greatest Game Ever 
Played, a sudden-death overtime 
loss to the Baltimore Colts.
Summerall showed great inter
est in playing with the Green Bay 
Packers; they were the only team 
interested that he could recall 
actually being part of the NFL, 
clearly indicating that they had 
the best chance to win the champi
onship. John Madden agreed: 
You know, I think Green Bay is 
better than all those other big ol 
teams that have kicking games 
that can be measured only by the 
width of some cubic inches of the 
nose of the ball. With the 
Turducken ready and, BOOM, 
some more wins and scoring 
chances, the Packers and Brett 
Favre sure are, just as you said!
Packers kicker Ryan Longwell 
commented on the prospects of 
Summerall joining the team after 
the game last night.
Its really hard to say [if I want 
him here]. I mean, Id actually pre
fer to be employed. I like having a 
job, being able to feed my family, 
and being able to pretend Im a big 
manly football player when all I do 
is kick. Ive got nothing against Pat 
Summerall, his family, his friends, 
his entourage, or even his acquain
tances. But I just dont know that I 
want him kicking for the Green
Bay Packers.
Summerall reportedly was 
inspired by similar comebacks in 
the sporting universe in recent 
memory  Mario Lemieux return
ing to the Pittsburgh Penguins, 
Michael Jordan returning to the 
NBA, and Major League Baseball 
returning to turmoil.
Said Madden, Seeing those 
comebacks really just aggravated 
an itch in ol Pat here, and he just 
had to scratch and claw and fight, 
tooth and nail, nose to nose, and 
thats what the kicking game is all 
about. That is something I wel
come seeing in this league of ours, 
a wondrous world where the ball 
must go 10 yards in order for the 
kicking team to recover. I never get 
tired of explaining that rule! 
Summerall had been in televi
sion for the past 40 years broad
casting football, and he had origi
nally given thought to retiring 
after broadcasting Super Bowl 
XXXVI in New Orleans.
However, the prospect of actual
ly playing in that game excited 
Summerall to the point that he 
could barely contain himself: I 
would not mind winning a Super 
Bowl championship, because it is a 
great party.
Fox representatives are not sure 
who will be the new play-by-play 
man with John Madden for the 
remainder of the season through 
the Super Bowl, but the producers 
did mention that they were 
searching for someone in a coma 
in order to maintain the atmos
phere of their top broadcasting 
team.
Uncertainty looms over future of 
CMU mens basketball program
by Jock Callandar
Defenseman
Does Carnage Melon have a 
mens basketball team? Thats a 
really good question.
After one dozen players from 
last years roster called it quits and 
all first-year recruits transferred to 
Allegheny County Community 
College, it is doubtful that a team 
still exists.
The Boosters Association has 
' called an emergency meeting for 
Monday at 6 pm in the University 
Center elevator to hammer out 
recommendations for the Athletic 
Department.
Athletic Director Ron Harley 
was non-committal about the con
tinued existence of mens basket
ball at Carnage Melon.
I think sports are important. But 
the future of America is at stake 
here at CMU, opined Harley.
The deflection of so many hoop
ers has created vicious betting in 
Las Vegas over the IM Majors bas
ketball league. One big IM official 
said that several former players 
had formed a team and were a 
serious contender.
If they can get past AM AllStars, there would be no one to 
stop them, said the executive.
CMU basketball coach Troy 
Winger hoped that the mass exo
dus would breath new life into the 
program.
Every ten years or so you run 
into this problem. However, I have 
my eye on some ringers to help us 
bring back the UAA crown!
He would not disclose the iden
tity of said ringers, but one is 
believed to be mathematics profes
sor Russ Runner. An avid CMU 
bball fan, Runner would at most 
likely give the team the size to 
match up against lowly opponent 
Brandeis University.
What remains to be seen, how
ever, is whether the CMU mens 
team could beat the womens 
squad. They meet Wednesday at 6 
pm in Skibo Gymnasium.

" In an unexpected announcement 
this week, Notre Dame named 
CMU football head coach Rick 
Leckner the new head coach of 
their football team. Leckner signed 
a five-year deal with financial 
terms undisclosed.
Leckner replaces Bob Davie, who 
was fired on December 2 after a 
five-year run with the Fighting 
Irish. In his last season he compiled 
a 5-6 record, and the Irish felt it 
was time for a change.
It is very exciting to name Rick 
Leckner as the new head coach of 
Notre Dame, said athletics direc
tor Kevin White.
In the recent years our program 
has not had the success we have 
expected, and so we are bringing in 
Leckner in the hopes he can rebuild 
our program to the caliber he 
brought to Carnage Melon.
Ever since the 19-0 loss to 
Carnage in 1926, we have tried our 
best to emulate their program. 
Now, 75 years later, we finally have 
the chance to take the leap and 
finally be on the same tier as CMU. 
It is a very exciting day for the 
Fighting Irish.
Im very excited to join Notre 
Dame, added Leckner. I took 
Carnage to the point where they 
are now ready to compete, perhaps 
even for the national title.
Notre Dame is a new challenge. 
There is potential there, as shown 
by their deep history, but I feel that
with the talent there and with all I 
bring with me, including the wingT offense, that this is a great oppor
tunity.
Just as CMU displays the game 
ball of the 19-0 victory in the 
coaches hall in their gymnasium, 
Notre Dame plans to display 
Leckners cqntract in their gymna
sium to mark their triumph over 
Carnage and finally end the bitter
ness that lingered for those 75 
years.
White added, The loss to CMU 
left a bad taste in their mouth. 
Now, with a coach that knows them 
better than anyone, we feel we will 
finally be able to compete with 
them again.
As for CMU, Were shocked, 
commented athletic director Ron 
Harley. We had no idea this was 
. coming. We wish the very best to 
Rick in his new venture, but he 
leaves a very big hole in our pro
gram. We are currently compiling a 
list of possible candidates for the 
position.
One of those candidates believed 
to be interested is Jon Gruden. He 
recently told Notre Dame that he 
was not interested in the job 
because he was still with the 
Raiders.
Another possible front-runner 
for the position is George OLeary, 
currently head coach at Georgia 
Tech.
OLeary, considered by most to 
be a shoe-in for the Notre Dame 
job, is considered by others to be a 
long-lost twin brother of Leckner. 
These same others feel that this 
astounding likeness was a factor in
Carnage Melon head football coach Rick Leckner, pictured on the right, beat out his long-lost brother George 0 Leary (left) for the Notre Dame coaching
job. Actually, which one is Leckner? 
Lecloiers hiring.
We made no mistake, said 
White. While the two do look 
remarkably similar, we did not get 
confused and hire the wrong man. 
Which one were we talking about 
again?
We cant really tell. In fact, Notre Dame 
However, the possibility of 
coaching CMU may be too much to 
turn down. Other candidates are 
believed to be Jacksonville Jaguars 
coach Tom Coughlin and Stanford 
head coach Tyrone Willingham.
One rumored sleeper candidate
and Touchdown Jesus arent quite sur 
could be Steelers head coach Bill 
Cowher. It is believed that when he 
wins the Super Bowl this year, he 
might look for a new challenge, 
which includes taking CMU to the 
national championship. Cowher 
would likely be the favorite candieither.
date, as he is so beloved in 
Pittsburgh.
Leckner leaves Carnage Melon as 
its all-time winningest coach. He 
was hired in 1986, and he ends his 
CMU career with a record of 
116-41-2.

The O serves magical grease
by Homer Pimpson
VP of Nothing Important
A recent study conducted at 
Carnage Mellon Unversity deter
mined rather surprisingly that the 
French fries served in gargantuan 
quantities at the Original Hot Dog 
Shop, long suspected of being a 
one-way-ticket to the Heart 
Attack Island Resort (HAIR), 
actually possess several benefits. 
Diners of the alleged food were 
shocked to learn about this reve
lation.
I always just go there for the 
fast food. You know, its not 
cheap, its not fast, the service is 
pathetic, and its hardly food, but 
at least if Im in the UC, I dont 
have to walk up the stairs, said 
one frequent restaurant patron, 
an indolent first-year physics 
major.
The much heralded virtues dis
covered in O fries include a 
wide variety of positive factors. 
The nutrients in the ingredients 
of the fries were found to be 
exceptionally beneficial for the 
health of ones right and center 
elbows, curing arthritis in these 
areas. Even if you find your final
vacation spot to be at the HAIR, 
the fries serve as a panacea, for 
victims of fatal heart attacks can
not later be killed by the bubonic 
plague, violent revolts by pirates, 
spontaneous combustion, human 
sacrifice, lung cancer, or other 
perils. Super-powers were also 
present in people who consumed 
the fries, but the specific details 
concerning this matter would not 
be officially released to the media 
or general public as of press time.
Thankfully, one CMU student 
came forward with the story 
about how his life had been 
improved by eating fries at the 
O. He reported that after 
unprecedentedly consuming two 
large orders of fries, by himself, 
he obtained the ability to fly. 
Although the meal was the rarely 
recognized dikfast, a hybrid of 
dinner and breakfast, its time in 
the middle of the night was not 
deemed relevant to the study.

the research findings revealed

Natrat sits down with William William!
by Bool Sheet
Procrastination Editor 
& Geeves Samuelson
His Lackey
Last Wednesday, William W. 
William was named to the new 
position of Head of the 
Administration Administration, 
where he will be responsible for 
administrating the day-to-day 
activities of the administration. 
William brings to CMU a back
ground that is anything but so-so. 
The Natrat recently caught up 
with William to discuss his lifes 
adventures.
TN: So William ... may I call you 
William?
WW: Sure thing, man. Or you 
can call me William if youd like.
TN: Okay, then. Tell us about 
where youre coming from and 
how you were chosen for this job.
WW: Well, my previous job was 
at William, William, William, 
William, & William associates, up 
in Walla Walla, Washington. One 
day, I was having some mahimahis with Jordan Jordan who 
currently works at Carnage 
Mellon. He told me about this job.
TN: Ah, yes. Jordan. Good guy. 
How do you know him?
WW: The two of us went to RPI 
and were roommates in Hall Hall.
It was back in the Sixties. But even 
though it was a very chaotic time, 
Jordan and I knew how to have 
fun. When we learned that Sirhan 
Sirhan had assassinated Robert 
Kennedy, we were out partying in 
New York, New York.
TN: Yes, New York, New York. 
The city so nice they named it 
twice, right? But didnt you feel 
weird about being detached from 
the events at the time? Its almost 
like you simply poo-pooed all the 
tragedy that happened.
WW: Dont get me wrong. I 
mean, Jordan Jordan  we used 
to call him JJ at RPI, by the way  
and I werent indulging ourselves 
in R&R at a B&B or anything the 
whole time. But I do have to admit 
that it wasnt until Boutros 
Boutros Gali became the UN 
Secretary General that I took up 
an active interest in public affairs.
TN: What did you do before 
working at William, William, 
William, & William?
WW: Hey, dont forget about 
me! I busted my ass to be a partner 
in that firm, too!
TN: Sorry, The William,
William, William, ' William, & 
William firm. What did you do 
before then?
WW: Not a whole lot unfortu
nately. Shortly after college, I 
started taking Fen-Phen to help
lose some weight. Unfortunately I 
had a bad reaction to it and con
tracted a really bad case of beri 
beri disease.
TN: Sorry to hear that. Are you 
feeling better now?
WW: Yes, Im feeling 111 percent 
better. Better than ever! Im out 
playing sports and everything. I 
even had a double double yester
day in basketball!
TN: Nice. So what do you do in 
your free time?
WW: I like spending time with 
my wife. Maybe you know her? 
Zsa Zsa Gabor? I also love music.
TN: Who are your favorite 
bands?
WW: Oh, a lot of the stuff you 
kids are listening to today. You 
know, like Duran Duran, 
Hermanss Hermits, Tony Toni 
Tone, even some classical, like Yo 
Yo Ma. I love his new covers of 
popular songs, especially Sugar 
Sugar.
TN: Uh ... yeah. Well, Im afraid 
were running out of time. Thank 
you for your time.
WW: No, thank you. And if any 
students have any questions, Ill 
be at the showing of Tora Tora 
Tora this Thursday. But then Im 
off to a vacation in Bora Bora, so I 
may not be around campus until 
January.

NEWS FLASH: Last week, Shitt 
students tossed aside their stale 
beer and dog-eared copies of Sports 
Illustrated and Cosmo to broaden 
their academic horizons by attend
ing a lecture on sex toys. Delivered 
by the prestigious employees of a 
pornographic Web site, the talk 
was originally scheduled to take 
place during freshmen orientation, 
but was postponed by University 
officials when they discovered it 
conflicted with an important beer 
pong tournament between Alpha 
Sigma Delta and Chi Epsilon Tau. 
Nonetheless, the event occurred 
just days ago, and The Natrat 
decided to take a break from real 
work and attend this talk to get a 
first-hand look at what life at a sec
ond-rate university is all about.
While normal college students
around the country were busy hit
ting the books in preparation for 
finals week, Shitt students were 
busy rubbing the pink eraser of an 
entirely different sort. Faced with a 
dizzying array of double dongs, 
vibrating wands, and nipple 
clamps, its no wonder the Shitt 
community  well-known for such 
accomplishments as attaining an 
average 750 (combined) SAT score 
 needed some help in protecting 
their own asses. To CMU students 
who consider themselves proficient 
in the act of installing external zip 
drives, the talk may have seemed 
trivial, but several Shitt attendees 
considered it the most worthwhile 
lecture theyd ever attended.
I skip my pre-algebra class at 
least twice a week, but there was 
no way I was going to miss this,  
said Jenny Deapthrot, a general 
studies major. Who knew you 
couldnt use the Slick Willy 2000 in 
the shower? I had even bought an
extension cord so it would reach 
long enough!
Michael Sucmeoff, co-president 
of Shitts Society of 
Undergraduate Underachievers, 
was pleased the lecture was so 
informative. Ive been looking for. 
things to stick up my ass for 
years, he said. After all, I spend 
my days just sitting on it, so I 
might as well get some kicks too, 
right? His lady friend, Claudia 
Nockmeupp, agreed. Without 
the help of the sex toy industry, 
my previous boyfriend and I 
might never have lasted the two 
meaningful months we did. 
Other students werent so 
impressed. A lot of different toys 
were presented today, but I think 
Ill stay loyal to my basic silicone 
dildo that Ive had since high 
school, said one anonymous stu
dent who looked as though shed 
had her share of silicone in other 
places as well.
All in all, the speakers pulled off 
the lecture with more ease than an 
unendowed man removing a jumbo 
condom. In sponsoring such a talk, 
the University of Shitsburgh dis
played once again their dedication 
to jerking off during this generally 
stressful time in the world of acad
emia. In, fact, attended by lazy 
first-year students and slacker sev
enth-year seniors alike, Sex Toys 
101 had a higher turnout rate than 
any course offered through the 
many departments of the 
University. Recent main-campus 
transfer student Aaron Fyngurfuk 
perhaps summed it up best when 
he said, I always hoped Id learn 
something in college. Now, after 
listening to the pros and cons of 
anal beads and latex bondage gear, 
I feel well prepared to go out into 
the world and make something of 
myself. Thank you, Shitt, for such 
wonderful use of my tuition dol
lars.

Last weeks Stupid Senate meet
ing was loud enough to be heard 
all the way over at Hunt Library, 
and the reason for the noise and 
" the revelry that accompanied the 
meeting was the success of the 
Senate over a Special Allocations 
Proposal to fund a research project 
that emphasizes the benefits of 
sales of alcohol, and other forms 
of marvelous liquors on the 
Carnage Mellon campus. The 
research was conducted by the 
Binge Drinkers Club on campus.
We are very excited about this, 
claimed Ryan Tamey, a Senator 
and a junior majoring in American 
drug policy, and one of the rea
sons is that such funding has never 
occurred before. This break
through research gives hope to all 
CMU students who can no longer 
get high as a result of years of sus
tained, resistance-building nar
cotics use. Upon interviewing one 
of the students involved in promot
ing the research, The Natrat 
learned that the new alcohol pro
posal would have a vast array of 
followers. This Senate funding 
has greatly helped many people on 
campus. The new policy will have 
an impressive number of uses and, 
hence, can meet the needs of an 
array of consumers. Its target mar
ket should also prove popular with

CS majors, speed freaks, and help

Test subjects have responded 
positively to the much-heralded 
miracle research. We feel that the 
Senate has done something great 
for once, said Captain Morgan, a 
sophomore and a member of the 
Binge Drinking Club on campus, 
We were invited to help in the 
research. Most of the research was 
conducted in the bathroom where 
the sink was close by. I managed to 
swallow about nine kegs of rum. In 
fact, we even found out that alco
hol consumption can be increased 
by 30 percent if it were accompa
nied by screams ofGo! Go! Go! at 
the top of your voice.
The Natrat even managed to 
catch a shaky, puke-covered Jim 
Beam Bourbon, the President of
the Club, with a rare comment, I 
love Stupid Senate. Stupid Senate 
helps me have more whiskey. 
When I buy the whiskey, I pour the 
contents down my throat. I love 
Student Senate. I love whiskey. 
Hie! Hie!
But the matter does not end 
there. Tamey even informed us of 
inherent benefits for the Senate 
members with this new allocation. 
Personally, I love alcohol. If we 
could get this thing rolling, we 
might manage to drop some booze 
in our rather drab meetings as 
well. In this way, we would be able 
to have better and more fun meet
ings. I look forward to getting high 
as a freakin plane.
The research is rumored to have 
cost $25,000, and involved buying 
15 crates of alcohol.

Recent graduate accepts job with 
Fortune500 company  McDonalds
by Gaylord Faulker
Staffwriter
Reel Dumass, a CMU graduate 
of the year 2001 has a lot to be 
excited about. He just managed 
to secure a position in McDonalds 
Corporation, a Fortune-500 
Company.
I am extremely happy about 
getting this job, remarked Reel, 
as he dumped a waste-bag con
taining half-eaten burgers and 
stale drinks into a larger wastedump.
Dumass works in the Oakland 
branch, worth a massive three 
million dollars. His decision was 
influenced by McDonalds high 
rank of 132 in the Fortune-500 
list, and also by the proximity of 
the work place to his home.
I will be paid $6.25 an hour 
with a monthly raise of 50 cents, 
along with $25 for joining the 
company, said Dumass. He stat
ed that he had to do plenty of 
research before he made his 
decision. Top contenders for
other hot job spots on his list 
were K-Mart and Lowes. 
However, I preferred 
McDonalds because of its world
wide repute, and also the fact 
that the job is more humanitari
an in nature than the ones that 
were offered to me by the others. 
I get to serve a lot of people.
Job hirers pose plenty of confi
dence in Dumasss capabities. 
Anudder Dumass, the Manager 
of the Oakland branch stated, 
[Reel] has had courses like 
Culinary and plenty of Social 
Service credits on his resume. 
Furthermore, he even headed 
Dining Services on CMU campus. 
In fact, we even have the same 
last name. How awesome is 
that!
Right now I am just taking in 
all that comes my way, said 
Dumass, anticipating the future, 
And soon Ill try and get some 
changes in, myself. After all, Im 
sure those CS courses are bound 
to help me Some of his major 
plans include installing a papertowel dispenser over the sink in
the bathroom, and also develop
ing a new cleaning device to 
scrub off disgusting meat-patty 
stains from the floor. I think we 
even need some more recipes for 
the menu; like all the stuff I got at 
The O and in the University 
Centers international cafeterias, 
he added.
Dumasss excitement seemed to 
be seeping from all the pores in 
his body just like the oil dripping 
from the hamburgers that he was 
cooking. I cant tell you how 
exciting it is to be a part of the 
biggest fast-food restaurant/cor
poration in the world.
Dumass is already looking for
ward to a promotion. Mr. 
Dumass, the manager, has put 
him to special works project that 
involves packing Pokeman food 
packs for children.
Before leaving, a sentimental 
Dumass also asked the Natrat to 
include a note thanking Carnage 
Melon University for opening 
such a whole new world of oppor
tunities for him. Thank you 
CMU, thank you so much.

Cheap food, lots of it to put you 
to sleep in your class. Quality is of 
secondary concern, said Apu.
Yeah the food is good. But I 
heard a rumor that they put bak
ing soda in their rice so it will 
inflate in your stomach? Is that 
true or what, said one student, 
Anush Fullofgas, a senior in chem
istry.
Apu denies such allegations. 
We give a lot of food for a little 
money. If students eat too much 
that is not a problem of ours.
Apu noted the changes he has 
seen in his customers in the last 
few years. Among other things, 
everyone on campus seems to 
think they are a goddamn expert
photographer. I wish they would 
just stop. I want to take their lens
es and smash it over their silly 
faces.
Apu has been taking anger man
agement classes at the local VFW. 
He hopes to be able to contain 
himself in the near future. In a 
recent incident he almost stran
gled a student to death after she 
made a off-handed remark.
She said something ridicoulous 
like Serrees Indian food is better. 
That cant be true. Look at me and 
look at him. He is reduced a van I 
have a whole cafeteria.
Drama students are up in arms 
about the possibility of the open
ing of Taste of India in Pukenells 
main auditorium, Chatchkis.
We are too good for all that. 
First off we dont want non-drama 
students coming into our building. They just dont belong here. 
Oh, and the smell is soooo dis
gusting. Its the kind of thing that 
will make me vomit without stick
ing a finger down my throat, said 
Petunia L. Vostrickgueister a 
junior in drama.
Despite the objections of the 
Pukenell dramats, Apu is pressing 
forward with his plans to expand. 
Dreaming of eventual world domi
nation, by forcing his nasty food 
on us all, Apu will single handedly 
wrest control from CMU president 
Gerard CJolon. While acknowledg
ing that Colons passion for creamsicles is catching on amongst CMU 
students, Apu was confident that 
he would be able to pump so much 
baking soda into the stomachs of 
students that there will be no 
room for desert. Good luck Apu!

0, from page
on campus while he was still a high school student. 
The content of this anecdote, although containing var
ious absurdities, has officially been ruled out from 
being pertinent to the issue.
Which department at our science- and research-rich 
school is responsible for these remarkable discoveries?
_ It may surprise you to learn that the researchers were 
none other than the oft-overlooked and unappreciated 
French Department; the department boasts a true 
understanding of French fries and other fine cuisines 
indigenous to New Orleans, Quebec, and a European 
nation considered to be affiliated with most French 
things. The head of the department confirmed this, 
emphatically, by commenting Oui. In fact, as the 
findings of the survey still remain predominantly unre
leased, much of what I have learned about this matter 
has come from my interview with him. I insisted upon 
having him speak through a translator, despite his con
tentions that such a frivolous measure was unneces
sary. He was bilingual, I concede, including fluency in 
English, the language in which he pled rather articu
lately. Although I have been sworn to secrecy, I can 
assure you that the findings will soon be published in 
their entirety, and that the O s fries will be revered 
as demigods.
An otherwise disgruntled senior-year French major 
was proud of her departments rare notable accom
plishment. Although the student matriculates at 
CMU, as a French major, she must take the majority of 
her classes at the University of Pittsburgh. She was 
unaware of any abnormalities at the CMU branch of 
The O, as she normally eats at the restaurants 3901 
Forbes Avenue location, more conveniently located to 
her classes at Pitt.
Benefits I will release, whether permitted or not, 
include those beyond typical nutrition and unconven
tional super-powers. Further consideration beseeches
me to mention these, irrelevant of my duties as an 
employee of the corrupt and corporately funded 
Natrat. The fries provide hygiene, as the grease pools 
that surround them on the accompanying trays are 
suitable for bathing. These pools are perfect for swim
ming, whether for exercise or recreation; students din
ing at the tables near the O can now swim without 
breaking through the glass partitions that separate 
them from the actual swimming pools.
Unlike most fast food places, the O is very environ
mentally conscious. Along with their offshoot eatery, 
Essies Deli, the O uses myriads of Styrofoam, which is 
sad. It is good, however, that paper and thus the trees in 
the worlds forests are conserved, for the paper baskets 
used to hold the fries are far inferior in size to what 
would adequately contain them, and thus more material 
is saved. By implementing potatoes as the main food 
source, the O is cultivating the food that they serve 
effectively, for facilities and resources needed by live
stock produce large amounts of waste, in addition to the 
animals suffering. (It came to my attention after the fact 
that The Original Hot Dog Shop does serve many meat 
products, too, hence the Hot Dog aspect of the restau
rants name. Alas, because my delete key is not function
ing properly, this misinformation cannot be erased).
Finally, although many more benefits will ensue 
based on the findings of this research in the near 
future, students can expect an increase in self-esteem. 
While CMU students are inherently dorky and, pre
dominantly still finishing up pimply puberty, they can 
be reassured that the grease on their faces pales in 
comparison to the quantities in the fries pools.
Whether or not the French Department actually sug
gests that the 0s fries can enable humans to fly, as a 
vegetarian and environmentalist, I would like to 
express my sincerest gratitude to The Original Hot Dog 
Shop for making this campus and the world a better 
place.

While observing a group of 
Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration students, I realized 
that GSIA backpacks symbolize 
their wanna-be-corporate culture, 
even though many of these people 
cannot tell the difference between a 
sweet potato pie and a sweet cheese 
croissant. However if the school 
didnt provide them with these 
backpacks, these students would 
have to make a very difficult, lifechallenging, decision, which they 
maybe are prepared for. Or not?
This reviewer conducted a 
focused group session with ten first 
year students. These students 
begin by consulting with their 
notes from decision models class.
Given one's preferences and limi
tations, one participant said that he 
would build a decision model using 
AHP (that is, Analytic Hierarchical 
Process). Then these students con
sulted their notes from their 
finance class and evaluated the 
advantages of using my credit card 
to purchase the merchandise, or to 
settle the transaction with cash 
stolen from the panhandler on 
Craig Street. They also mentioned 
that timing is important. Interest 
rates are record low at the moment.
Moreover, a group of second year 
students, they are after all more 
matured after having been exposed 
to classes after classes with model
ing applications, started thinking 
bigger and larger. While conduct
ing the focused group session, a 
student suddenly burst up that he 
would run a Monte Carlo simula
tion using a Geometric Browning 
Motion with 1000 paths. He also 
elaborates that he would create a 
generic Excel template; he even 
considers the possibility of creating 
a bond calculator, a backpack pre
dictor system  with C++ applica
tions.
With these reasons, the school 
may have decided to provide the 
students with uniform backpacks. 
Making a selection may take some 
students a long time, and the emo
tional distress imposed may push 
some students onto the edge. GSIA 
compress all of their classes into 
minis; as a result, students are 
always on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown.
At the end of the day, this reviewer 
asks whether this quantitative 
approach is much ado about nothing.
Earth-shattering discovery 
leads CMU name change to 
Senior Citizens University
THE  T
MEEK _________^
ARE INHERITING 
OUR 
CAMPUS
TU EDK/mD EB Eog
New emperor of
RFD IaDr ESaDDS YWhaKom
Following a police investigation 
into the true identities of Carnage 
Melon University founders Andrew 
Mellon and Andrew Carnegie, the 
Bored of Rich White Guys has 
decided to propose a name change 
of Carnage Melon University to 
Senior Citizens University.
During the past year, many CMU 
campus police officers left their 
posts in the basement of Doherty to 
mill through old newspapers in 
Kunt Library. Other officers have 
searched the Pittsburgh archives at 
the Carnegie library, and a few 
have been spotted interrogating 
the Original Cold Fries Shop 
employees in Oakland.
Suspicions arose during a fight 
between O and Si Seor employ
ees which escalated into an all out 
water polo match to take place in 
the conveniently located University 
swimmin hole. During the inci
dent, an O employee shouted at 
his opponent, You swim like 
Andrew Mellons mother! Finding 
this suspicious, and frankly having 
nothing better to do other than 
solicit illicit substances off of 
misc.grocerystore, a CMU police 
officer who overheard the 
employee in for questioning. If the 
given testimony was true, then 
Andrew Mellons best friend from 
seventh grades great-grandson 
currently serves up greasy fries to 
campus fast-food fanatics.
The CMU police finally acquired 
enough evidence and released an 
official statement on December 1st,
2001. We have uncovered that 
Andrew Mellon, supposed financial 
genius and former secretary of the 
treasury, was really not Andrew 
Mellon at all, reported Sgt. A1 
Batross.
An outraged University President 
Gerard Colon was whoreing CMU 
when told of the situation, but 
quickly resolved the issue with a 
joint news conference with the 
Board of Rich White Guys.
Carnage Melon was appropriate 
in its time. We must now realize 
that our financial obligation lies 
with Citizens Bank, our neighbor 
and friend, said Colon.
Mellons moniker was actually an 
alias used by the shy Pittsburgh cit
izen who chose to keep his real 
name a secret. The real Andrew
Mellon was confirmed to be a for
mer employee of the hotdog ven
dor that preceded the now famous 
O. With Citizens Bank taking over 
Mellons banking operations, Colon 
said the financial windfall could be 
tremendous with the naming 
rights.
This just goes to show everyone 
has a price tag, commented a 
glum Satan, who was program
ming in Weiner Hall when told of 
the change.
Under the plan, Citizens would 
pay $150 million spread over 30 
years.
The Carnage appellation may be 
changed to Senior in order to 
clarify the founders relation in the 
Carnegie family tree. The police 
investigation revealed that 
Carnegie actually had a son with 
Margaret Morrison, named 
Andrew Carnegie.
Yes, yes its true, but its not 
incest! cried an indignant 173 year 
old Morrison.
Andy Jr. became a Portugese 
drug runner during the 1930?, 
eventually disappearing from the 
planet.
Colon said the inclusion of 
Senior in the title might ultimate
ly lead to a more diverse popula
tion.
Do you realize the enormity of 
the elderly population in Allegheny 
County? We could invite them to 
coffee and boom, sign them up for 
college! Chances are they could 
even help the Ween odor problem 
with a cancelling scent.
Senior citizens would also 
reduce the Universitys health care 
costs.
Medicare has deep, deep pock
ets, said professor of pubic policy 
Bob Stress.
Both the Mellon Institute and the 
Mellon College of Science have 
officially changed their names to 
the Citizens Institute and CCS 
(Citizens College of Science) 
respectively.
The CMU police, smug and open
ly pleased with themselves com
mented on the scandal. Fraud like 
this really hurts the community. 
We were just honored to be in the 
right place at the right time to save 
this community from a future cen
tury of lies. Now if we could just 
find those bastards contributing to 
the moral decay on campus by 
posting sexual solicitations to 
. misc.grocerystore...

Natrat Publishing plan
ning expansion; Pistol, 
Shitt News on hit list
PITTSBURGH (RATWIRE)  A top Natrat official 
confirmed today that their publishing group would 
be attempting a hostile takeover of the University of 
Shittsburghs student newspaper, The Shitt News.
The Natrat is also planning on discussing buyout 
plans with the often mentally distressed Pistol, the 
Carnage Melon yearbook. However, The Natrat is 
currently in talks with The Shitt News publisher.
We have been raising the bar since 1906 and 
been independent since 1806 and we will continue 
to raise the bar without The Natrat, said an indig
nant Baba ORiley, Chief Propaganda Officer of The 
Shitt News.
Shitts Vice Provost for Student Life Jack Daniels 
declined to comment on the negotiations status, 
but did add that their student newspaper is a 
cesspool.
I wouldnt wipe my ass with that rag. I dont 
think Ive ever seen a sorrier excuse for a college 
paper. When you publish front page stories about 
doubledongs, fashion shows, and circus freaks, 
youve got to realize you have severe problems, 
said Daniels.
The Shitt News has come under fire recently for 
running five days a week, despite having not nearly 
enough good content for even two days a week. The 
paper also receives a subsidy from the Shitt of near
ly $500,000 in addition depreciating assets.
Frew Street was unsurprised by the buyout 
rumors. Analysts at the FAST Lab said Shitts been 
shopping the paper for nearly 90 years.

The training wheels have been removed, but the bike remains stationary. 
Carnage Melon University President Gerard Colon began riding the worlds 
largest bicycle in an attempt to power the Pittsburgh campus after a disas
trous failure of the Universitys windmill energy project. The giant wind
mills involved in the energy project, located in nearby Somerset County, suc
cumbed to severe weather conditions right before the Thanksgiving break.
Despite the looting that ensued during the CMU blackouts, Colon was 
ecstatic about the possibilities of a bicycle-powered university,
CMUs commitment to alternative energy sources makes us a world-class 
institution. The bicycle-powered University is the wave of the future! said 
an obviously deranged President Colon.
The first wind storm of fall on November 15 tore the propellers off CMUs 
windmills. A bearded janitor wearing a blue jumpsuit and cowboy boots 
was injured in the accident, when a falling blade from one of the windmills 
nearly sliced his protective baseball cap in half.
For three weeks, pupils struggled to a quality of life comparable to 
BCE (Before Computer Era). Electrical and computer 
engineering students attempted to bogart electricity 
from the University of Shittsburgh. However, all of 
Shitts energy could power only the Weiner clusters, 
and the red digital sign on Pukenell.
Riots ensued in other parts of a disgruntled University, 
leading to the Worlds Biggest Bonfire (WBB) at 
Whorener Hall.
We were just trying to make people aware of our 
cause that CMU is fueling the violence in the Middle 
East, Afghanistan, inner-cities, English futbol matches, 
and Philadelphia Eagles games exclaimed Student 
Pacifist group leader and WBB organizer Tony Zi.
Windmill Three employees from the HUB were sacrificed as part 
of the activities.
While CMU struggled to deal with a 50% power loss, blackouts were con
centrated in the Pukenell Center, as Drama students were most comfortable 
with being left in the dark.
The mind is a mysterious place, said Dramat Dean Martin D-Cup.
Colon said some confusion as to the extent of the wind-power project 
might have contributed to the severe loss of power. Students had begun run
ning mainframes again from dorm rooms.
Some persons must have misinterpreted that the wind power would only 
be five percent. I dont remember saying that, spurted Colon.
For the time being, Colon will remain bicycling for power until another 
extravagant, alternative, PR-friendly source of electricity comes along  a 
wait expected to take years.
Incidentally, in another boost for the Universitys image, Colon is expect
ed to break the Guinness World Record for Bicycle Endurance of 500 days, 
set by Thomas Godwin of Great Britain in 1939-1940.
Additionally, Colon and his henchmen devised a scheme to not only 
power the University, but also raise money in the process. The Campaign for 
P-P-Power will ride the worlds largest two-wheeler under the guise of a 
charity event.
For every mile I ride, pledges will donate a dime for charity,  said 
Colon.
The first three months of proceeds will go toward the School for College 
Athletics at Melon (SCAM). Athletic Director Don Johnson was too confused 
to comment.
Colon hired Pants Armstrong for $10,000 to assist in the training 
process. Like a proud parent watching his toddler trade in the high-chair 
for the bicycle seat, Armstrong reflected on Colons work ethic and accom
plishments.
I remember the first few days were extremely tough. He didnt know 
what a kick-stand was. Wed cry for hours, holding each other so tightly. But 
our passion persevered and Im proud to say Colon is not only my student, 
but myfriend.

EMMY AWARDS ARE HELD BUT CHRIS KLEIN TURNS DOWN FLIGHT FOR MOVIE OPENING; AL-QAIDA DECLARES TRIUMPHANT VICTORY
by Carl Spackler
Cricket Lounge Correspondent
After having been postponed ear
lier this season, the 53rd primetime 
Emmy Awards ceremony was final
ly held under heightened security. 
Although it was a toned-down 
affair, there was almost unanimous 
agreement that it was the right 
thing to do.
We must hold the ceremony no 
matter what, said John Lithgow, 
who was nominated for Best Actor 
in a Comedy Series and was sport
ing a red, white, and blue bandan
na around his head. We cannot let 
those damned terrorists win!

Patricia Heaton in her acceptance 
speech as she took home the Emmy 
for Best Supporting Actress in a 
Comedy Series for her work in 
Everybody Loves Raymond. And our 
solidarity must continue tomorrow 
night with support of this countrys 
greatest television products. So tune 
in to CBS at 9 pm when Raymond 
and I finally teach that Frank a les
son about all those mean things he 
does to my poor Robbie!
But in a sudden development 
later that evening that has the 
Quadragon scratching their heads, 
actor Chris Klein refused to board 
an intercontinental flight for Paris 
to attend the French opening of 
American Pie 2. Shortly after word 
of this appeared on www.peoplemagazine.com, al-Qaida
declared victory.
The jihad is a war of many many 
fronts, said Omar Moreno, an alQaida spokesperson. We are now
finally seeing further triumphs on 
one such front: getting Hollywood 
stars to cancel public appearances.
When asked about the Emmy 
Awards going on, Moreno com
mented that it was a most unfortu
nate occurrence, but added that 
all of the al-Qaida network is too 
busy celebrating the Klein develop
ment to really care.
Meanwhile, in the Quadragon, 
the Emmy Awards ceremony has 
taken a backseat to the latest 
defeat.
I cannot believe it, said 
Secretary of Defense Donna 
Rumpsfeld. We had the al-Qaida 
network right where we wanted 
them and we thought that we had 
the full support of Hollywood 
behind us. Apparently, we were 
wrong.
Make no doubt about it, the 
President does realize that this 
high-profile refusal to go on an 
intercontinental flight is not a 
minor setback, said White House 
Press Secretary Airy Flesher. But 
the President still promises that we 
will win this war. God bless 
America.
Klein has been apprehended by 
the National Guard in his North 
Hollywood mansion. He will be 
subjectable to a military tribunal.
Klein was unavailable for com
ment, but his attorney, Lionel Hutz, 
released a public statement.
My client, Mr. Klein, has been 
deathly afraid of flying since the 
age of eight when he had a violent 
reaction to some chicken and rice 
that was served on the flight, said 
the statement. He is fully aware of 
his important role in the ongoing
from that Rodney King tape
Chris Klein  seen here with hair gel  is taken away by federal law 
enforcement following his refusal to board an intercontinental flight. He will 
be subject to a military tribunal. In the background, a lynch mob forms to 
protest his involvement in that shitty-excuse-for-a-movie Say It Aint So.
war on terrorism, but assures the 
public that his decision was in no 
way made due to fear of another 
terrorist attack.
Al-Qaida, on the other hand, 
does not accept Hutzs explanation.
Klein is a very very cowardly boy 
when it comes to flying and many
many other things. He didnt even 
get it on with Mena Suvari in 
American Pie, said Moreno. I 
mean, she was practically ready to 
ride his baloney pony at that post
prom party. Hell, even Kevin 
Spacey copped a feel of the lovely 
Suvari in American Beauty.
PUMP vs. PIMP  Thugbot paternity suit
Mr. Lover Lover
Roxtar
A judge in the Sprawling Urban Jungle has 
ruled that the Allegheny County, PA, pimpin 
hustlin thugged-out robot Thugbot must turn 
over a blood sample containing his DNA so that 
Lisa Leftover Lopez, Thugbots one-time girl
friend, has a chance to prove that she is, in fact, 
his babys momma.
However, as Thugbot has no blood, alternaPapa Thugbot/Tartanbot
tive means must be used for the testing. This 
brings up many legal issues with no precedent, 
such as the morality of subjecting Thugbot to 
invasive surgery in order to perform tests on 
his circuitry. A related issue is, of course, the 
privacy of inmates, as Thugbot is currently 
serving a three-year term for hustlin in some
one elses territory, in addition to a large fine 
for slander against members of the gang 
known as Triple D.
The ruling stems from a dispute over the prof
its of the ordinary-robot-turned-superstars top 
radio hit Lifetime Supply (of Olde English). 
Lopez claims that the lyrics of the song clearly 
refer to the alleged 1999 affair with Thugbot 
that produced her son. Fool cant deny it any 
longer, she says, suggesting that Thugbot 
should pay for child support, noting that the 
only way hell have to do that is when his pater
nity is proven.
Thugbot admitted having an affair with a 
woman  unnamed, but referred to as the gold 
diggin ho  in his autobiography, Dont be no 
Playa Hata. He claims in h^ book that the gold 
diggin ho has psychotic tendencies, and is 
actually, in fact, a crack ho. It is unlikely, he 
claims, that he fathered her son because Lopez 
gets around. Buh lee dat.
Lopez, who wants a full half of the royalties 
from Lifetime Supply, says shell give up her
claim if the DNA doesnt match. Shes already 
had blood drawn from her son to test against 
Thugbots sample. I aint no scrub, she says, I 
want this baby to have an education. And its 
gonna come from Thugbots scrillah.
Ravergirl, Thugbots current girlfriend, makes 
few comments to the press, but does not look 
visibly upset about the suit. When questioned 
about her opinions on the suit and how it was 
affecting her relationship with Mr. Bot, she 
blinked once and returned to staring at her 
shiny pants.
Meanwhile, a televised debate between the 
well-known privacy-defenders Protection for 
Inmates with Mechanical Parts (PIMP)  led by 
Ralph Nader  and People Undoing Mans 
Problems (PUMP) continues, regarding the 
DNA content of circuitry and the legal issues of 
extracting it for examining.
Thugbot already has one son, Thugbot Jr., 
with whose mother Thugbot has no contact. 
PUMP representative Jerry Falwell points to 
this as proof of the downfall of the American 
family. Clearly, Thugbots hugely immoral 
past is conclusive evidence that he is at fault 
in this situation now. He is without a doubt 
this babys father. He must have watched too 
much television. We must unplug this robot 
before further harm is done to the American 
people.

Theres a CS Nerd in My ClosetI 
Thursday, December 13
What do you you do when theres a smelly, raunchy CS nerd in 
your closet? Why, you open it of course! These scourges of per
sonal hygiene and social graces are afraid of the sunlight and will 
turn to dust with prolonged exposure to the yellow rays. 
However, there exists a band of renegade CS majors, who pre
tend to be normal, who live outside of the cluster among the rest 
of us. Some of these people are indeed normal, functioning 
members of the human race, but others try to convert. Theyll 
lure you to the cluster, and chain you up inside of Weaner to live 
the same desolate existence that they lead.
We call these people Weanises. Id like it if someone were to 
take the fence and paint, Dont be a Weanis. Weanises smell, 
they have the constant stench of Cluster Funk, and embody gen
eral dishevelment. Weanises are only comfortable with other 
Weanises. They want the whole world to be a giant Weanis. 
Theyd fortify the globe in a giant concrete slab if they could, with 
a drab grey interior and ugly walls. Please, everyone, dont 
become a Weanis. Dont be converted!

Dont Go Out With Her; Shes Yinz 
Friday, December 14
This blockbuster classic comes to McConomy tonight, after top
ping the box office profit list for 10 weeks in a row. This movie 
features Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as two dashing University 
of Shittburgh students, originally from Boston and Milwaukee, 
respectively. They encounter various girls in Pittsburgh, and they 
warn each other not to date specific ones, because they are yii^z. 
Now, a majority of girls they meet are sweet, nice, and quite, 
attractive. However, Affleck becomes smitten with a Yinzer,, 
aged 22. Her golden mullet, and pit-stained home Stillers jersey 
are irresistable to him.
Damon insists that Affleck not date Kitty, as shes called^ 
because shes too Yinz. Damon goes on to say that he cant under
stand a word she says. He has to listen to Myron Kope and WDVE 
skits to learn what shes saying. Affleck doesnt listen. He contin
ues on his quest of star-crossed mullet love until one night. He 
took her because he wasnt good enough to hold her hand. Their 
child, raised with love and care, became Yinz too. He has his first 
MIT (Mullet in Training) at age 7, and the rest is history.

Its Not Another Senior Citizens Movie 
Saturday, December 15
Take your grandmother to this one!! This is a spinoff of the 
ever-popular teen movies. It features the weird old lady at church 
who cant sing. It also has the dirty old man, the senile next-door 
neighbor, and the incontinent lady across the street. Of course, it 
wouldnt be complete without the miserable old couple that 
doesnt give your ball back when it lands in their yard. The senile 
man and the lady with the diaper get together to beat up the 
church lady. But then they forget about it.
The movie starts when Stiffler (from American Pie) throws his 
football to his friend going deep. They mean it to land in a crowd 
of girls, but he overthrows and it goes into the cranky old mans 
yard. He takes his ax, and pummels it into the football. He tells 
the rest of the fogies that Stiffler gave him attitude, and they 
gang up to rid the town of youngsters. To do this, they walk up
hill both ways for five miles in knee high snow to the arsenal. 
They get their minutemen rifles and pitchforks, trying to chase 
the hooligans away. Come to McConomy to see the rest.

Frosty: The Untold Story 
Sunday, December 16
Frosty the Snowman was a jolly happy soul. Indeed he is, but 
what of the Frosty, the dark side of Frosty? The Frosty we know 
is the Frosty that was released from the North Pole Clinic for the 
Criminally Insane. Before Frosty had his corn cob pipe and his 
button nose, he had an AK-47 and a bayonette for a nose. He was 
raised in Santas Ghetto, only knowing street crime. One day, he 
snapped, and killed and ate a dozen elves. He said they tasted 
like a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts.
He was sent to the North Pole Clinic for the Criminally Insaii6 
after being convicted. 20 years later, he emerged. He was a 
happy Frosty; a calm and sociable Frosty. He gave candy to little 
kids, lived harmiously with the elves, and was a loyal spokesman 
for Santa. But the question is, does Frosty still have his illnes? 
Can he crack at any moment? Thats the inquiry that this docu
mentary answers. It promises to be interesting.
WARNING: Parents, be very careful when taking your children 
to this. It may ruin preconceived notions and hamper their 
Christmas spirit.

Once upon a time-, there was a 
boy who went to college. He 
wanted to start anew-, to be 
cool. He wanted to leave his 
dungeons and dragons days 
behind him.
Upon arrival-, he was recruited 
by several greek organizations 
with offers of unity and 
balance and brotherhood.
After a whirlwind courtship-, 
he finally settled on one tha 
seemed to accept him.
But despite the fact-, the boy 
was still largely unpopular.
He couldn't understand why 
everyone shunned away from his 
penchant for anal sex videos.
He tried and tried to think of 
ways to win them over. 
Calculus-, chemistry and 
physics were of no help.
Eventually-! he accepted that 
he was a dork and resumed 
watching pornography with his 
mother and a tub of vasoline.
