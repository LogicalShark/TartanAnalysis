Talking to

Campus debates 
merit of public art
by Claire Morgenstern
News Editor
It seems like common sense 
that the universitys decision 
regarding public art on campus 
should involve, well, the pub
lic. Last Wednesday, the Center 
for Arts in Society held a public 
arts forum, during which mem
bers of the campus community 
were able to voice their opin
ions on the subject.
The discussion was the first 
of a three-week chain of events 
to be held on the subject, all 
of which precede a campus 
conversation on the topic that 
will take place on April 11. The 
meeting began with opening 
statements by Clark Glymour, 
philosophy professor at Carn
egie Mellon, and Terry Smith, 
art professor at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh, before the 
floor was opened to questions 
and comments from audience 
members.
Smith stated that public art 
requires some sort of response 
from the public, whether its 
positive or negative. If theres 
no reaction to a new piece of 
art, he said, then its not serv
ing its purpose and the public 
needs to be involved. Glymour, 
on the other hand, viewed pub
lic art as more of an imposition 
on the public that should be 
done away with.
Between 80 and 100 people 
attended the event, according 
to Krista Campbell, director of 
the Center for Arts in Society.
The meeting was intended 
to be a precursor to the campus 
conversation, informing people 
of the issues before the actual 
deliberative poll takes place, 
Campbell said. People need 
to be more informed about the 
process if they feel the need to 
become involved.
After Walking to the Sky, 
the universitys most contro
versial public art piece, was 
installed last May, members of 
the campus community felt that 
the decision had been made by 
administrators with little input 
from the community at large. 
The administration realized 
that Carnegie Mellon needed 
an official public art policy in 
order to prevent such issues in 
the future.

No price control for birth control

To avoid another Walking to the 
Sky controversy, the university 
will hold a forum on public art.

For college students, safe sex 
just got more expensive. Prices 
for prescription contraceptives 
have surged at student health 
centers across the country.
The recent Deficit Reduction 
Act (DRA), passed by Congress 
and signed into law by President 
Bush, prevented the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Ser
vices (CMS) from allowing j 
universities to purchase 
hormonal birth control at 
discounted prices as they 
had been able to do in the 
past.
Prior to the DRA, student 
health centers were exempt from 
Medicaid laws that required com
panies to pay a certain amount 
of money back to the govern
ment to ensure that Medicaid 
patients were getting the lowest 
price for the drugs. This allowed 
drug companies to sell drugs 
in bulk to non profit clinics 
like student health centers.
This method enabled com
panies to gain customer 
loyalty and the student 
health centers to reduce 
out-of-pocket costs for 
students, according to 
the American College 
Health Association 
(ACHA).
As of January 1, 
however, the law was 
changed to include 
college health centers 
among the organiza
tions that have to pay 
the government to com
pensate for offering 
lower prices to its patients. 
Therefore, health centers 
have been forced to charge 
more for prescriptions to pay 
back the government.
The reason was that, since col
lege students werent included 
in the average price from which 
companies had to make up the 
difference, they were paying ap
proximately 15 percent less than 
their non-college-affiliated coun
terparts. The government was 
forced to charge all these coun
terparts the same discount, or
bring the price at college health 
centers up to par with that of free 
clinics and hospitals.
In addition, Congress became 
aware that some drug companies 
cheated the system by selling 
discounted drugs to for-profit 
hospitals in order to increase 
sales, according to the ACHA.
The change has affected col
leges and
have been particularly hit hard 
are those who do not have insur
ance coverage for birth control 
or have higher deductibles and 
those students who do not want 
their parents to be aware of their 
use of birth control and pay out 
of pocket for that reason. 
Carnegie Mellons student 
health center provides 
birth control to about 
800 women on camof generic brands, which cost $20 
per pack. In addition, students 
with health insurance through 
Carnegie Mellons recommended 
insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, 
will continue to receive their 
contraceptives at a discount (be
low $20).
Barkin suggests that 
students who are still 
unable to afford the 
new prices consider 
non-prescription al
ternatives, such as 
condoms. When used 
correctly, condoms are 
effective in preventing 
both pregnancy and sexu
ally transmitted infection, 
and are cheaper than 
prescription methods.
If a condom slips or 
breaks, a woman can 
take Plan B (also known 
as the morning-after pill), 
which is available for $30, Barkin said.
As many college students tend 
to be on a tight budget, the recent 
rise in the price of birth control 
may cause students to seek 
other less-expensive 
options. Unfortu
nately, many of the 
less-expensive options 
are also much less ef
fective, ' said Brian 
McGraw, a sophomore 
in H&SS and one of the 
universitys sexual assault 
advisors.

Leaders 
earn praise,

A fledgling organization 
started only a year ago, men
toring organization Leaders in 
Learning is working to broaden 
its wings.
Leaders in Learning, a com
munity service initiative, hires 
Carnegie Mellon students to 
tutor underprivileged gradeschoolers in the Hill District. 
The program is intended to 
foster mentorship, community 
pride, and literacy improve
ment. It aims to go beyond the 
students academic well-being 
and broaden their worlds while 
instilling in them the values and 
confidence needed to succeed.
Meant to fill a tutoring void 
created last year by the closing 
of a long-standing Hill District 
program, Leaders in Learning 
hired 20 students this 
year as mentors and 
tutors to work in
dividually with 
I children in 
grades three to 
f five. In special 
cases, Leaders 
in Learning also 
takes the childrens 
younger siblings to 
ensure that all those inter
ested can participate.
The tutors are compen
sated and are able to use the 
job as work-study hours with 
wages comparable to those of 
on-campus job.
The tutors work in conjunc
tion with Miller Academy, one 
of three elementary schools re
maining in the Hill District after 
the citywide budget cuts last 
year.
Miller Academy has had to 
confront the challenges brought 
on by the No Child Left Behind 
Act. Passed in 2002 by the Bush 
administration, the No Child 
Left Behind Act has instituted

New SDS minor approved

Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons faculty 
has created a new rigorous and 
scholarly program that will bet
ter prepare its students to take on 
the world.
Professors from the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, 
the Heinz School of Public Policy 
and Management, and Carnegie 
Institute of Technology teamed 
up with the social and decision 
science department to design 
an interdisciplinary minor, In
novation, Entrepreneurship, and 
Economic Development (IEE). 
IEE focuses on globalization, 
technological change, business, 
creation, and an understand
ing of the world and forces that 
govern entrepreneurship and 
innovation.
In the coming years, two 
factors will become ever more 
important in our economy
 innovation and globalization 
... Our curricula will have to 
change and adapt so as to best 
prepare Carnegie Mellon stu
dents for these developments, 
said Ashish Arora, professor of 
economics and public policy in 
the Heinz School.
Next year, Arora will be teach
ing Technology and Economic 
Growth, which is one of the core 
eight classes offered within the 
minor.
Right from the beginning, 
university President Jared Cohon and Provost Mark Kamlet 
were interested in making this 
minor a possibility, in addition 
to Pradeep Khosla, dean of engi
neering, Steven Klepper, social 
and decision sciences professor 
and founder of the minor, and 
Shelley Maddex, associate direc
tor of foundation relations.
Last year, Carnegie Mellon 
applied for a grant from Ewing 
Marion Kauffman Foundation of 
Entrepreneurship. After propos
als; meetings, and presentations 
to the Kauffman Board in Kan
sas City, the university received 
a $3 million grant. In return, 
Kauffman requires Carnegie 
Mellon to generate $15 million 
and a commitment to the minor 
from the whole community. The 
university encourages students 
from all colleges within the 
university to participate in the 
minor because it develops a cli
mate for entrepreneurship and 
analytical, communicative, and 
practical skills.
I think this international per
spective is increasingly essential. 
Technology-driven industries 
are all global industries, and an 
increasing number of key firms 
are based outside the United 
States, said Lee Branstetter, as
sociate professor of economics 
and public policy. Much of my 
teaching within the new minor 
will be designed to prepare CMU 
students for a world in which

Students from the universitys Qatar campus spent their spring break doing community service in Pittsburgh.
by Mona Maher
Junior Staffwriter
Last week, eight students from 
Carnegie Mellons Qatar campus 
took advantage of the Alternative 
Spring Break (ASB) program, 
volunteering their time and skills 
to help the residents of Carnegie, 
Pa. Just outside of Pittsburgh.
This was the third year for the 
program, which was organized 
by Renee Camerlengo, director 
of special projects for the Office 
of the Dean of Student Affairs, 
along with community advisor
Caryl Tuma and David Stanfield, 
director of Student Activities, 
both of the Qatar campus.
This was the second year that 
the program was focused on 
community service.
The students time and effort 
were spent contributing to the 
Community Revitalization Plan, 
an arrangement between Carn
egie Mellon and the borough 
of Carnegie to repair damages 
caused by Hurricane Ivan in
2004.
On their first day of work, the 
students helped create a com
puter lab that will become part
of a multipurpose community 
center in Carnegie. The lab will 
act as a hub for members of the 
community to gain computer 
skills and learn to use computers 
to improve their overall working 
capabilities.
Initially, the lab had a modest 
budget of $5000. However, after 
some of the Carnegie inhabitants 
heard the students ideas for the 
lab, they donated an additional 
$5000 to bring the students busi
ness plan for the lab to fruition.
The following day, the students

Campus News in Brief
University Police becomes state-accredited
On March 10, University Police 
became the first state-accredited university police force in 
Pennsylvania. The accreditation 
was granted by the Pennsylvania 
Chiefs of Police Association af
ter an extensive review of the 
forces policies, procedures, and 
operational standards.
There are 123 standards and 
184 sub-standards that a po
lice force must meet in order 
to be considered for accredita
tion, including having a secure 
evidence room and an audioand video-monitored interview 
room, proper procedure, support 
of written policies, and efficient 
organization of operations.
To determine that Carnegie 
Mellon met all the required 
standards, the Pennsylvania 
Chiefs of Police conducted facility and vehicle inspections, 
interviews with police officers 
and dispatchers, examinations 
of personnel files and case re
cords, and rides with on-duty 
patrols.
Each member of the force, 
comprising 24 police officers, 
37 security guards, 12 shuttle/ 
escort drivers, five dispatchers, 
and one administrative associ
ate, was carefully inspected.
University Police was es
pecially commended for the 
quality and depth of its writ
ten operations manuals, 
service, attention to details, 
and commitment to the campus 
community.
It is a great honor to receive 
this distinction, said Sergeant 
Richard Sima of the University 
Police. Everything was judged,
from facilities to appearance 
to procedure. We put a lot of 
hard work into the process, had 
great leadership, and definitely 
learned a lot.
The accreditation would not 
have been possible without 
changing the location of police 
headquarters in January 2006 
from the old Student Center to 
their current location at 300 
South Craig Street,
The. move allowed for many 
of the physical requirements to 
be attended to, ones that would 
never have been possible in the 
former campus location.
Carnegie Mellon is one of only 
two accredited law enforcement 
agencies in Allegheny County, 
along with the Findlay Township 
Police Department.
Statewide, only 45 of the
230 agencies enrolled in the 
Pennsylvania Law Enforcement 
Accreditation program created 
by the Pennsylvania chiefs have 
attained accreditation. The 
program aims to provide an 
incentive /for agencies to pro
mote professionalism and the 
continuous development of law 
enforcement agencies.
We couldnt be prouder to 
join this select group of orga
nizations, said Sima. It shows 
that we have become a truly 
professional university force.
Carnegie Mellons accredi
tation is valid for three years 
from its inception as long as 
University Police submits an
nual reports and statistics to 
show that they have maintained 
the stipulated standards and 
sub-standards.
Grad students

Carnegie Mellon will cel
ebrate the achievements of 
students in its graduate pro
grams during Graduate Student 
Appreciation Week, April 2-6.

University moves ahead with plan for enlarged Entropy store
by Claire Morgenstern
NewsEditor
All who have ever been trapped in 
one of Entropys miniature aisles, take 
heart. This summer, Campus Services 
(the conglomeration of Dining Services 
and University Stores that was created in 
July 2006) will break ground on the con
struction of Entropy-f, a larger version of 
Entropy that will contain fresh produce 
and pre-packaged meals.
Its obvious Entropy in its current lo
cation is too small, and there has been 
consistent feedback for several years 
that meal plan holders would like to use 
DineXtra in Entropy, stated Tim Mi
chael, assistant vice president of Campus 
Services, in an e-mail to The Tartan.
The new stores tentative location is 
by the University Centers pool, a conve
nient location for students, faculty, and 
staff from all sides of campus, accord
ing to Michael. The store will function 
as both a convenience store and mini 
grocery store, carrying fresh fruits and
vegetables, an enlarged coffee station, 
and fresh baked goods from the Carnegie 
Mellon Bakery, like the Carnegie Mellon 
Caf and the Maggie Murph Caf, as well 
as all the convenience items available in 
the existing store.
In addition, customers will be able 
to use PlaidCa$h, DineXtra, cash, and 
credit cards to pay for merchandise.
However, due to the stores smaller 
size and limited audience, its prices will 
not be as low as those of superstores like 
Giant Eagle.
We will strive to provide the most 
value for the campus community for 
the best pricing we can obtain, Michael 
stated.
However, before the plans were fnlized, Michael felt the need to solicit 
feedback from the campus community. 
Over the course of the semester, he has 
met with the Student Dormitory Coun
cil, Student Senate, the Dining Advisory 
Council, and staff members from the 
Office of Student Activities and the 
University Center.
The feedback has helped us shape
our merchandising plan for products and 
services, Michael stated.
One group who did not have input was 
Entropy employees.
They brought out the proposals last 
week to see what students thought, but 
we werent solicited for feedback, said 
Greg Hinkofer, an Entropy supervisor.
The staff was concerned that if the 
new store was not run by the university, 
as it is now, but by Parkhurst Dining, a 
private company that supplies the major
ity of dining establishments on campus, 
they might be out of jobs.
Its still up in the air as to who will be 
in charge, CMU or Parkhurst, Hinkofer 
said. If its Parkhurst, theyll bring in all 
their own people.
Prices would also be inflated to match 
those of the companys other campus 
dining venues, he said.
Im kind of worried, said Entropy 
employee Vince Parker, a first-year in 
materials science and engineering. I 
would have to find another job.
Fellow employee Kyle Mountan, a 
first-year in mechanical engineering,
One of two proposed plans for the expanded

at Entropy in the new location but wasnt 
sure if hed still be able to depending on

start construction shortly thereafter. Entropy+ is scheduled to open on October

ages to the basement of Sunset 
Pizza, a Turkish family-owned 
business in Carnegie.
[Sadi Bircans] business 
opened slightly before the hur
ricane and was one of the local 
businesses that were seriously 
impacted. The students water
proofed the basements to help 
protect against similar damage 
of flooding in the future. In this 
case, the students really saw the 
people who were benefiting from 
their work, Camerlengo said.
The ASB program aims for 
students to walk away with a 
greater appreciation of commu
nity service.
It felt completely different 
than anything weve done or ex
perienced before, said Fatima 
Al-Ruinaihi, a sophomore in 
business administration. We 
all felt that we had an impact 
on Mr. Bircans life. After tear
fully describing the flooding of 
his business, we all worked even
harder than wed been previ
ously, because we wanted to help 
as much as we could.
Camerlengo said that the Of
fice of Student Affairs makes 
subtle changes to the program 
each year in hope of continuing 
to improve the experience for 
the students that attend.
This year, we tried to contextualize the objectives more by 
talking about what is needed to 
make a community thrive, and 
we looked at how the students 
contribution can be restorative, 
but also forward-thinking, Ca
merlengo said.
While their itinerary included 
on-campus activities such as 
Greek Sing and Campus SuperStar, the visiting students felt 
they lacked interaction with 
the student community on the 
Carnegie Mellons Pittsburgh 
campus.
I wish we could have spent 
more' time with the students, 
said Hala Abbas, a junior in busi
ness administration.
We wanted to know more
about life on the Pittsburgh 
campus, said Maha Al-Khulaifi, 
a sophomore in business 
administration.
Camerlengo agreed that one 
of the hardest challenges during 
cross-campus initiatives such 
as ASB is meeting the variety of 
individual expectations that stu
dents have.
I would love to have had the 
students do some reading ahead 
of time about the type of work 
they will be doing in addition to 
gaining information about the 
Pittsburgh campus before they 
actually arrived, she said.
When students from the 
Pittsburgh campus visited Qa
tar in 2005 and 2006, their 
trips focused on enhancing stu
dent connections between the 
two campuses, not community 
service.
What I would also like to 
discuss are the opportunities to 
volunteer in Qatar, when stu
dents visit the Qatar campus 
from Pittsburgh in the future, 
Camerlengo said.
ART, from A1
was put up without due consul
tation, said Dan Giesey, a junior 
philosophy and modern lan
guages major and Coro fellow in 
local democracy for the South
western Pennsylvania Program 
for Deliberative Democracy and 
the Coro Center for Civic Lead
ership. There was a need after 
that to create a process that was 
inclusive and reflective of com
munity need.
The Policy for Public Art at 
Carnegie Mellon University, ap
proved by the presidents council 
onFebruary24,2006, established 
a process for the installation of 
public art on campus. According 
to the policy document, it called 
for a Public Art Committee (PAC) 
to review proposals for public art 
pieces, make recommendations 
to the president, and clarify the 
need for public art on campus 
in accordance with the campus 
master planning process.
The campus conversation is in
tended to inform participants of 
the new policy and allow them to 
provide feedback on the issue.
If the public art committee
has an idea of what people think, 
they will have a benchmark of 
whats appropriate to put on 
campus, Giesey said.
Participants will meet in small 
groups with a moderator to dis
cuss the issues raised by the pol
icy. At the end of the discussion, 
each participant will complete a 
survey that will be used to deter
mine the campus communitys 
overall opinion regarding public 
art.
In a very real sense, there is 
already a campus conversation 
about public art, said Robert 
Cavalier, a Carnegie Mellon phi
losophy professor and director of 
the universitys Center for the Ad
vancement of Applied Ethics and 
Political Philosophy. Were try
ing to formalize the conversation 
and make it more deliberative.
As of last Friday, 82 people 
had registered to participate in 
the event, and another 42 signed 
up to volunteer.
In addition, those who are 
unable to attend can partici
pate online via Project PICOLA 
at caae.phil.cmu.edu/picola/ 
public_art/. Participants can 
contribute to online discussions
at prearranged times and then 
complete the survey, identical to 
the live sessions. The site will be 
active April 11-16.
This conversation is the third 
conducted on campus since
2005. The previous discussion, 
on faculty course evaluations, 
took place in September.
Giesey predicts that this 
semesters turnout will be 
greater than the last. For the 
first time, Campus Conversa
tions partnered with the alumni 
association and used online 
recruitment tools to reach a 
wider audience.
He also believes that the up
coming events topic should 
appeal to a broader audience 
than faculty course evaluations, 
which almost exclusively affect 
faculty and students. To more 
people, Giesey explained, public 
art on campus should be both in
teresting and controversial.
The results of the deliberation 
will be presented April 23 to the 
Public Art Workshop, a division 
of the Center for Arts in Society.

campus conversation, visit caae.

MINOR, from A1
process itself has been global
ized. Significant components of 
it take place outside the United 
States, and Asian countries, in 
particular, play an increasingly 
important role.
Branstetter will be teaching 
The Global Economy: A Users 
Guide and The Rise of the Asian 
Economies, both of which are in
cluded in the core eight courses 
in the minor.
[The new minor] will thrust 
Carnegie Mellon into a leader
ship position in education for the 
world of today and tomorrow, 
Cohon said. When they gradu
ate, our students will work in a
world in which there will be a 
premium placed on innovation 
and the ability to understand and 
manage change, especially tech
nological change, and to respond 
in an entrepreneurial fashion.
Stephen Klepper, founder and 
organizer of IEE, has set aside 
$500,000 from the Kauffman 
grant to encourage faculty to de
velop courses in all colleges that 
expand upon the principles out
lined in the new program.
If it works out right, there 
will be a tremendous amount of 
classes for innovation, business, 
creation, and creativity from 
many domains within the uni
versity, Klepper said.
Five out of the eight core
classes within the minor were of
fered for the first time this year as 
a test run. All quickly filled up.
I think IEE would be a great 
class for economics majors. I am 
interested in taking it because it 
seems like it would offer a lot of 
new useful information about the 
world economy as a whole, said 
Christine Steffa, a first-year eco
nomics major. I am especially 
interested in working globally 
and understanding their busi
ness dynamics and economy.
Hopefully a lot of students 
will be intrigued by this, espe
cially as we move forward. We 
hope to be swamped by demand 
 that would be a nice problem, 
said Klepper.

Meanwhile, in the absence of 
a permanent solution, affected 
students have been forced to 
make some quick budgeting 
decisions.
The price increase is detri
mental to [everyone] on campus 
... People will have to cut down 
on other things they buy to 
still afford it, said Ali Oppelt, 
a first-year in CIT who receives 
her birth control from Student 
Health Services.
The ACHA is lobbying for an 
amendment to the DRA that 
would allow collegiate health 
centers to purchase contracep
tives in bulk, as before. A group 
of representatives from the 
ACHA even traveled to Capitol 
Hill in an effort make the CMS 
aware of the negative impact of 
the DRA upon students at col
leges and universities across the 
nation.
I hope no one decides not to 
use [birth control] because of 
the price increase, Oppelt said.
Advocates across the country 
are working toward a solution 
in hopes of preventing this prob
lem.
There has been a nationwide 
outcry from student health ser
vices across the country on this 
issue, Barkin stated. We con
tinue to follow and support the

gie Mellon students, faculty, and 
staff.
The kids seem to love these 
workshops because they expose 
the tutorees to subjects that they 
might be unfamiliar with in a 
very fun way, Mereba said. I 
just really like seeing them par
ticipate and get excited about the 
activities.
The programs on-campus lo
cation exposes the students to a 
rigorous academic atmosphere, 
some for the first time. Prior to 
entering the program, many of 
the students had never thought 
of attending college.
Each child in the program 
keeps a .journal, which allows 
staff to track their progress both 
academically and emotionally.
When we first met one child, 
he wrote that he dreamed to be 
a football player, Romanosky 
said. As time went on, he wanted 
to go to college and play football 
there. Now, he said he wants to 
work hard in school so he can 
play football at the University of 
Pittsburgh. Its these little things 
that make the organization so 
rewarding.
Most of the children come 
from families that cannot afford 
to send them to college. Leaders 
in Learning aims to show chil
dren that attending and paying 
for collegeare viable options.
A college graduate makes, on 
average, at least $12,000 more 
per year than a high school 
graduate, according to the U.S. 
Census Bureau.
In everything we do with the 
students, we try to convey the 
message that they cannot fail, 
Romanosky said. For them, col
lege seems like an impossibility, 
but we want them to know that 
not only college, but success in 
life, is achievable.
Leaders in Learning is hoping 
to involve more students, faculty, 
and staff as participants in the 
program.
Our program is constantly 
on the lookout for ways we 
can expose our kids to new 
professional paths, said Elea
nor Zimmermann, a fifth-year 
policy and management senior 
and Leaders and Learning tutor. 
Wed love to have more CMU de
partments take our kids on a tour 
and explain what it is that they 
do.

Contraceptive method of choice among 
U.S. women who practice contraception**
reach and service activities as 
well as it does with technology 
initiatives. This fiscal year, the 
universitys Joint Funding Com
mittee (JFC) allocated a total of 
$981,482 to clubs and organiza
tions. Of that, $18,882, or only 
1.9 percent of total funds, was al
located to science and technology 
clubs, such as the Robotics Club.
I think many people feel like 
science clubs are favored more 
because of their requested bud
gets, said Aaron Johnson, a 
senior electrical and computer 
engineering major and Robotics 
Club vice president. Clubs like 
ours just need more money for 
equipment and club materials. 
An oscilloscope alone costs about 
$2800.
The proportion of requested 
funds has resulted in a JFC pyra
mid of support, beginning with 
Activities Board committees and 
followed by club sports, larger 
organizations such as the Asian 
Student Association, and the 
Robotics Club. The pyramid is 
not based on the clubs relative 
importance, but out of the orga
nizations monetary needs.
The Robotics Club has grown 
from 30 to 140 people in only four 
years, with a 70 percent increase 
in membership last year alone. 
While service clubs such as Lead
ers in Learning always manage to 
generate enough tutors and sup
port staff, there is not the aspect 
of power by numbers.
Leaders in Learning has not yet 
applied to the JFC to be eligible 
for funding.
I would be happy to speak with 
the group about alternative fund
ing sources that may be available 
to them until they apply for rec
ognition and funding eligibility, 
said John Hannon, interim direc
tor of Student Activities.
However, Leaders in Learn
ings first priority is finding more 
interested students.
We think we have the funding 
aspect under control, Ro
manosky said. Our focus right 
now is to generate student inter
est and enthusiasm.
Leaders in Learning offers 20 
students each the opportunity to 
tutor and mentor one child from 
the Miller Academy. Additional 
students are always needed to or' ganize the program and help out 
with the younger children.
The tutors meet with the chil
dren multiple times a week and 
engage in workshops such as 
jazz, Spanish culture, dance, and

ensure that students are not pro
moted to the next grade without 
the correct skills. Addition
ally, the act gives the students a 
chance to attend a better school 
if they are not promoted as of the 
acts standards.
As a result, these measures 
have placed an enormous amount 
of pressure on the Miller Schools 
teachers and administration to 
ensure that the students learn 
all they need to be promoted to 
the next grade. Especially given 
the student population of under
privileged children with very low 
confidence levels, this proved 
to be a big task for the school 
to undertake; currently, only 6 
percent of this districts children 
attend college.
Christa Romanosky, a senior 
creative writing major, recog
nized the problems at the end 
of last school year. By the begin
ning of this years fall semester, 
Romanosky had put the program 
into action.
To ensure that they reach the 
student population, the school 
has had no choice but to teach 
with a drill and kill method, 
Romanosky said. Leaders in 
Learning enhances the students 
learning through one-on-one 
help in a safe and enjoyable set
ting.
The drill and kill method can 
best be described as teaching the 
students the subjects using mass 
methods, without taking into ac
count each individual student.
However, Romanosky worries 
that the program will not receive 
enough funding to keep it run
ning on a year-to-year basis.
This year, Leaders in Learn
ing was funded with the help of 
Pittsburgh grants and Heinz en
dowments. Romanosky plans to 
branch out to other funding op
tions in,future years.
I would like to see more en
thusiasm and also continued 
support from the campus com
munity, said Marian Mereba, 
program tutor and sophomore 
creative writing major. There 
is something really special about 
this program that ought to be ac
knowledged.
The program has been recog
nized as a university-sanctioned 
organization and is allowed to 
use campus facilities for its ac
tivities, refuting the common 
misconception that Carnegie

Center to 
use PROBE
by Christine deBriffault
Staffwriter
A new skill is on the horizon 
for this generation of children. 
In addition to the typical read
ing, writing, and mathematics, 
students will be expected to 
know how to think like com
puter scientists.
By way of a three-year, $1.5 
million grant from Microsoft, 
Carnegie Mellon University and 
Microsoft are teaming up to cre
ate the Carnegie Mellon Center 
for Computational Thinking.
The mission of this center 
is to promote computational 
thinking within computer sci
ence and other disciplines, such 
as psychology and business, for 
students and teachers.
The center will support 
PROBEs, or Problem-Oriented 
Explorations, as inspired by the 
Carnegie Mellon Aladdin Cen
ter, a center devoted to studying 
algorithms.
A PROBE is designed to bring 
together scientists involved in a 
wide range of fields, including 
academia, industry, and gov
ernment, to focus on problems 
encountered in the real world.
PROBEs will facilitate the 
centers mission by providing 
an intellectual base upon which 
new science can be invented 
and a way to quickly transfer re
sults from one application area 
to another.
According to Jeanette Wing, 
head of the computer sci
ence department, PROBEs 
will cover topics such as pri
vacy, parallel and multi-core 
computing, data-intensive 
computing, embedded medi
cal devices, and game theory. 
Computational thinking will be 
the key to solving the real-world 
problems discussed in PROBEs.
The center will also support 
the spread of computational 
thinking to Carnegie Mellon 
and other schools and universi
ties, including college students, 
K-12 students, and teachers.
Wing said that computa
tional learning should start at 
a younger age, and she already 
has a CS4A11 summer pro
gram in place. The program, 
organized by Lenore Blum 
and Tom Cortina, professors 
of computer science at Carn
egie Mellon, invites high school

Global warming expert raises concerns 
over dramatic climate change in lecture
by Jun Xian Leong
Staffwriter
Thomas Homar Dixon from the Univer
sity of Toronto presented a talk last Monday 
at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History 
entitled Global Warming in Polar Regions: 
Is the Canary Singing? and served to add 
another viewpoint amid worldwide concerns 
over rising global temperatures.
Dixon is the director of the Trudeau Centre 
for Peace and Conflict Studies at the Univer
sity of Toronto, where he is also a professor of 
political science. Dixon is one of the leading 
experts on the effects of climate change and 
previously served as advisor to Al Gore dur
ing the making of An Inconvenient Truth, an 
award-winning documentary about global 
warming.
Toward the beginning of his presentation, 
Dixon said, It is my belief that the Arctic will 
be changed beyond recognition in the next 
50 years.
As global populations increase, global 
carbon emissions have gone up as well, and 
not all of it is absorbed, he said. The result 
is a net increase in carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere, which leads to an increased 
greenhouse effect, thus raising global tem
peratures.
Contrary to popular belief, the greenhouse 
effect is not a wholly unnatural phenomenon. 
The natural greenhouse effect, which is es
sential to life, is produced by the large amount 
of water vapor in the Earths atmosphere, 
keeping the Earth around 30C warmer than 
it would be otherwise.
However, Dixon said, The change in 
climate cannot be caused by solar forcing
alone. There has to be some feedback, some 
external activity or amplification.
One alarming trend Dixon noted is that at
mospheric carbon dioxide levels are increas
ing exponentially rather than linearly and 
have shown a very marked increase in recent 
years. One explanation presented by Dixon is 
that the natural carbon sinks in the sea are 
becoming saturated and thus can no longer 
absorb carbon dioxide optimally.
Another possible explanation is that the 
hike in oil prices has driven people to use 
coal as a source of energy. Coal releases 
much more carbon dioxide than oil per unit 
of energy.
He said, Scientists have concluded that 
the increase in temperature ... is due to in
creasing levels of carbon dioxide.
See WARMING, page A7
How Things Work: Volcanoes
Michelle Bova
Contrary to what sixth-grade sci
ence projects tell you, the combination 
of baking soda and vinegar is not what 
makes a volcano erupt. Actually, there 
is more going on inside a volcano than a 
few household items.
Volcanic eruptions and formations are 
linked processes. Basically, a volcano is 
a portion of earth in which subterranean 
materials have made their way to the 
earths surface.
Humans live at the surface level of 
Earth, which is called the crust. Though 
the earth has many small layers, scien
tists call the first major area beneath the 
crust the mantle, and the area beneath 
the mantle the core. Magma, the main 
component in volcanoes, comes from the 
mantle region of the earth.
Volcanism is the process through 
which inner materials of the earth come 
up to the earths surface. It is also the 
process by which a planet cools itself.
There are three major ways in which 
volcanic activity can occur: spread
ing-center volcanism, subduction-zone 
volcanism, and hot-zone volcanism. All 
three types of volcanism are caused by 
the movement of tectonic plates.
In spreading-center volcanism, the 
tectonic plates move away from one an
other, forming an ocean or continental 
ridge. As the plates separate, the mantle 
rock flows up into the space created be
tween them.
Here, the mantle rock melts to form 
magma, which emerges and forms a new 
crust. This process does not create a vol
cano as we know it, but it does patch up 
holes in the earth.
Most volcanoes are formed by sub
duction-zone volcanism. This process 
occurs when two tectonic plates collide 
and one plate from the lithosphere (the
The conical form of a volcano is created when magma pushes or penetrates the earths crust.
layer made up of the upper crust and the 
top layer of the mantle) is pushed deeper 
into the mantle, which forms a trench 
(usually located at the ocean floor). Most 
scientists believe that heat and pressure 
eject water from the lower plate (the sub
ducting plate) into the upper plate.
Now that the upper plate contains 
more water, its melting point decreases 
and the upper plate melts into magma. 
The magma flows out and up because it is 
less dense than the surrounding rock. If 
under enough pressure, it spews through 
the surface. Otherwise, magma forms in 
a chamber beneath the earths crust.
Another way that volcanoes form is by 
hot-spot formation, which is not caused 
by shifting plates, but rather, by hotter, 
deeper magma rising from the lower to 
the upper mantle.
The hotter material from the lower 
mantle can then form an area just un
der the earths crust that is called a hot 
spot. No eruptions will occur at the sur
face, but as the plate above the hot spot 
shifts, a series of volcanoes forms. This is 
how the tropical vacation spot we know 
as Hawaii formed.
In both subduction-zone and hot-spot 
volcanism, magma always seeks lower
pressure regions, so it rises toward the 
surface because it is less dense than the 
surrounding rock.
To form the conical shape of a volcano, 
one of two things happens: The magma 
pushes crust materials up around it, or 
magma spews forth and cools, collect
ing over time to form a mountain or hill, 
though it is possible to have a volcano in 
a crater or plateau.
The reason that magma does not al
ways reach the surface immediately is 
because when the surrounding rocks 
pressure exceeds the pressure of the 
liquid magma, it can keep this magma 
temporarily contained just beneath the 
earths surface.
Over time, the magma pressure can 
rise to exceed that of the surrounding 
rock, causing the molten rock and magma 
to spew forth through the surface.
Many dissolved gases exist in magma, 
and as long as the surrounding rock exerts 
a pressure greater than the gas vapors, 
the magma will remain contained. 
However, if the gas vapor pressure ever 
exceeds the pressure exerted by the rock, 
the dissolved gases expand and form 
bubbles called vesicles.
When vesicles form, one of two things 
happens: either the pressure of the sur
rounding rock decreases because of the 
decompression caused by the lowering 
pressure point of the magma, or the gas 
pressure increases because the cooling 
magma has crystallized and therefore 
enriched the gas inside it. Magma filled 
with the tiny gas bubbles has a lower 
density than the surrounding bubblefree magma, and so the gas bubbles push 
the magma up and out of the volcano 
chamber.
The result is lava spewing out from a 
chamber just beneath the earths crust, 
thus forming the best-recognized version 
of the volcano.

Microsoft recently released 
details about its new Xbox 360 
Elite video game system. This 
upgraded system will include a 
120-GB hard drive, HDMI out
put, and a new paint design for 
a manufacturer-suggested re
tail price of $479.99. The Xbox 
360 Elite will hit stores on April 
28th. The decision to make a 
newer version of the Xbox is 
based on feedback from current 
owners requesting a larger hard 
drive and HDMI output.
The increase in hard drive 
space will allow users to store 
large files, such as high defini
tion video downloads from Xbox 
Live. Many analysts dont see 
the new black Xbox 360 with a 
larger hard drive and HDMI as 
a response to the PlayStation 3 
made by Sony  rather, many 
feel it is a response to the new 
Apple TV. Microsoft currently 
offers high-definition cables in 
the box and a larger hard drive 
than its competitor, Sony.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 2, 2007
Author and photographer holds exhibition on marshes and wildlife
by Deren Guler
Assistant Photo Editor
Where does nature hide its 
treasures? The answer to this 
question is at the Carnegie Mu
seum of Natural History.
The museum is currently host
ing Marshes: The Disappearing 
Edens, an exhibition of William 
Burts 30-year exploration of 
North American marshes.
According to Burts exhibit, 
marshes are abundant and unex
pected treasures.
Burt is a photographer and 
writer for magazines such as 
Smithsonian and Audubon. He 
has also written three books, 
two about birds  Shadowbirds 
and Rare and Elusive Birds of 
North America  and his latest, 
Marshes: The Disappearing Edens, 
which tells of his exploration of 
marshes.
In his exhibit at the Carnegie 
Museum of Natural History, Burt 
has constructed a portal into the 
world of marshes. This exhibit 
currently takes up half of the mu
seum gift shop.
The exhibit contains 40 pho
tographs of the various marshes 
Burt has traveled to, and various 
quotes from his book are placed 
near the photographs.
According to his website, Burt 
enjoys searching for wild places 
and birds found in marshes. He 
has explored marshes in a variety 
of places, including Connecticut, 
Manitoba, and the Northern 
Plains. His photographs present
different aspects of the marsh 
but highlight hidden birds, like 
rails and gallinules.
Marshes are defined to be ar
eas of land filled with water. 
The water exists on the surface, 
meaning that it is groundwater.
Randall J. Hunt, adjunct 
professor of hydrology at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison, wrote in his article Do 
Created Wetlands Replace the 
Wetlands that are Destroyed? 
[Marshes are the] kidneys 
of the landscape because of 
their role in filtering the ef
fects of surrounding land use, 
and have widely recognized 
functions that include storm/ 
flood water retention, shore
line protection, water-quality 
improvement, and wildlife 
habitat.
Marshes can also keep waters 
on the surface clean. Conse
quently, some people build their 
own marshes to take care of 
wastewater from various sources, 
including farms, parking lots, 
and small sewage plants.
According to the New York 
State Office for Technology, 
Highly organic, mineral-rich 
soils of sand, silt, and clay un
derlie these wetlands, while 
lily pads, cattails, reeds, and 
bulrushes provide excellent 
habitat for waterfowl and small 
mammals, such as red-winged 
blackbirds-, great blue herons, ot
ters, and muskrats.
Special kinds of marshes, 
called tidal marshes, prevent
nutrients from forming in high 
concentrations. If these concen
trations do occur, they could 
threaten organisms by leading 
to low oxygen levels. Such is the 
case in the Dead Zone of the 
Gulf of Mexico.
Non-tidal marshes, on the 
other hand, usually form from 
streams that enter lower regions 
of land that are not adequately 
drained. They also form in shal
low waters, such as the waters 
along the periphery of lakes or 
ponds. These types of marshes 
are often found in North America 
and are freshwater.
Not only do tidal marshes 
create environments that are 
suitable for wildlife, they also 
help protect the environment 
around them by slowing and 
storing the floodwater, thus alle
viating flood damage.
In the exhibit, Burts quotes 
that accompany his photographs 
give the viewer an even better 
understanding of the marshes on 
display.
Describing his impression of 
these hidden worlds, Burt wrote, 
Beauty, yes, its everywhere in 
the marshes. Its in the unity of 
stems and blades, the random
ness of tufts and tousles, and the 
slickness of wet pads and leaves, 
its in the flow of distance, the 
long reach to the sky.
Marshes are completely nat
ural. They are self-sufficient 
because everything that exists 
in the marsh exists because it is 
able to help maintain the envi
ronment. Thus, outside factors, 
such as pollution caused by hu
man settlements, can be a great 
threat to marshes and cause what 
some environmentalists refer to 
as ecocides, or threats to the 
ecosystem.
According to Hunts article on 
wetlands, about one-third of endangered species live in wetlands, 
but these wetlands make up only 
five percent of the landscape.
Many environmental and 
political groups recognize this 
threat and are making efforts to 
mediate it.
There is proof of environmen
tal damage, said Greg Karris, 
from Communities for a Better 
Environment, in a past issue of 
Metro. The city agrees. If this is 
aot the situation to put a cap in 
place, what is?
In much of our manhandled 
world, the marshes are the last 
pockets of the frontier, the last 
uncharted Edens, Burt said. 
The exhibition guides the viewer 
through this frontier with images 
of the life cycle of the marsh.
According to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, Its a beautiful ex
hibition, packed full of treasure 
and surprise.... It gives a glimpse 
of the world we seldom wander, 
and elusive creatures most of us 
will never see.
Marshes: the Disappearing
Edens will be on display at the 
Carnggie Museum of Natural 
History until June 17 before trav
eling to Chesapeake Bay Mari
time Museum.

Computing center becomes reality
COMPUTATION, from A6
teachers to campus and 
exposes them to the 
possibilities of 
computing.
Junior JT c o m -
putersci- ence major
Andrew Warshaver said, Its 
about time we 
caught up to the 
rest of the world and 
infltrate while theyre 
young.
In the March 2006 is
sue of Communications of 
the ACM, Wing stated that 
computational thinking 
is about using abstrac
tion and automation 
to solve problems, 
design systems, 
and under
stand human 
behavior. To figure out 
the level of abstrac
tion that will be useful, 
one must be able to decipher 
between insignificant data and 
relevant data.
Computational thinking is 
defining these abstractions. 
Algorithms, for instance, are 
procedures used to solve par
ticular problems, and data types 
are structural representations of 
information. The ability to per
form procedures in two or more 
levels of abstraction and deter
mine the relationship between 
these levels is also computa
tional thinking.
In a speech given by Wing 
on March 26 in Newell-Simon 
Hall, she used an example about 
elementary math to illustrate 
computational thinking: In
grade school, when you learn 
long division, you are learning a 
specific algorithm to divide one 
number into another; when you 
learn about sets, you are learn
ing about a specific data type 
that enjoys certain algebraic 
properties that other data 
types do not. Sets are unor
dered and have no duplicate 
elements; sequences are 
ordered and might have 
duplicate elements. 
During the speech, 
she also said that 
abstraction and 
automation via com
putational thinking 
give us the ability to 
scale beyond what one 
human can do in time 
or reach in space. 
According to Wing, 
some concepts that are
important to understanding 
computer science and computa
tional thinking are complexity 
(computability, intractabil
ity), programming languages 
) (syntax, semantics, compila
tion, interpretation, correctness); 
[and] computer architecture 
(processing units, memory/stor
age units).
Computational thinking uses 
these concepts, and many oth
ers, to develop such tools as 
algorithms and heuristics.
The center will also support 
communication through Mind 
Swaps, meetings where research
ers share data and decide how to 
approach significant problems in 
computer science.
Microsoft currently holds 
Mind Swaps for developers and 
researchers to exchange ideas 
about real-world problems and 
solutions.
In a press release issued by 
the School of Computer Science, 
Carnegie Mellon President Jared 
Cohon stated, Carnegie Mellon 
itself is an example of how the 
power of computational think
ing can energize disciplines 
across campus.
To further facilitate this en
deavor, a new class called Ways 
to Think Like a Computer Scien
tist is in the works for incoming 
first-years.
Josh Mann, a senior business 
major, said, As time goes by, 
computer science and computa
tional thinking will have a more 
important role in business as 
well as other fields, and a class 
like this will be beneficial to 
prepare students for successful 
careers.
Expert talks about global warming
WARMING, from A6
No matter whether we take 
the optimistic or pessimistic 
view, temperatures are predicted 
to soon rise far above the levels 
of previous millennia, he said.
At the current rate of fossil fuel 
consumption, the amount of car
bon dioxide in the atmosphere is 
projected to reach four times the 
current level by the year 2150, as 
stated in the latest report by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Cli
mate Change (IPCC).
The report states that if the 
current trend continues, the 
average global temperature is 
expected to rise 3.1C by the year 
2085.
Climatologists believe that 
as little as 2C of global warm
ing is sufficient to cause serious 
climate changes, and this is pre
dicted to happen within the next 
century.
According to Dixon, there are 
four key changes that signify the 
intensity of recent global warm
ing: The melting of sea ice and 
Greenland icecaps, changes in 
oceanic circulation, the melting 
of permafrost, and nonlinear cli
mate change.
Arctic ice in the past 20 years 
has lost upward of 25 percent 
of its area and 30 percent of its 
thickness due to increasing tem
peratures.
Although it is difficult to mea
sure the precise decrease, there 
has been an obvious steady 
decline in sea ice. In fact, the 
Greenland icecaps are currently 
melting at a rate of 220 to 250 cu
bic meters a year, a rate which is 
double that of the past 10 years.
Recent studies have also been 
probing the effect of cracks in 
the ice shelf, according to Dixon. 
These cracks, which have not re
ceived attention until recently, 
have been discovered to be a 
major factor in the collapse of ice 
shelves.
Warm water percolates down 
through the cracks, spreading 
warmth to the lower layers, and 
then expands as it freezes again, 
driving the ice shelf apart like a 
wedge.
Oceanic circulation will also 
be significantly altered by this 
melting, as large amounts of 
freshwater are released into the 
ocean. A large portion of the 
Earths climate is determined by 
a deep undersea current, known 
as the Conveyor, which propels 
water around the Earth from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific.
The major driving force of the 
Conveyor is the cold, salty water 
of the North Atlantic Ocean. This 
water is denser than warm fresh
water and thus sinks to the ocean 
bottom, pushing water through 
the worlds oceans.
The Conveyer is responsible 
for bringing warmer water to 
the North and South Poles, and 
it brings cooler waters to the 
equator. This movement of wa
ter is important to temperature 
regulation, as the warmer water 
heats the atmosphere.
These currents may become al
tered, however, with increasing 
climates. In particular, melting 
glaciers could lead to increased 
amounts of fresh water.
Moreover, the notion of non
linear climate change implies a 
snap change in climates, Dixon
said.
When asked if there was any 
hope remaining for the planet, 
Dixon replied, There was a pa
per published by a consortium 
of 20 scientists stating, among 
other things, that there is not 
an observable natural reaction 
which can counteract the effects 
of global warming.
However, he continued to 
say that if drastic measures are 
implemented immediately, we 
might be able to contain the 
scope of climate change..
On September 30, 2006, the 
publication of the Stern Review 
Report, commissioned by the 
treasury of the United Kingdom, 
provided a similar response on 
the issue of global warming. 
The scientific evidence is now 
overwhelming: climate change 
is a serious global threat, and 
it demands an urgent global 
response. There is still time to 
avoid the worst impacts of cli
mate change, if we take strong 
action now, the report stated.
We should expect the future 
to be a volatile period; times like 
these have been periods of dras
tic social change, from history, 
Dixon said. However, regard
less of which house party wins 
the upcoming election, be it Re
publican or Democrat, I expect 
to see global warming an issue 
that will be tackled seriously by 
the new legislature.
Dixon closed his lecture by 
saying, What weve learned this 
decade is that we cant ignore 
nature. I expect this century to 
be called not the age of biotech
nology, or nanotechnology, but 
instead, the age of nature.

Birth control prices
To stay or not to stay: One 
graduating seniors decision
Does Pittsburgh offer the best post-grad environment?
Students and health professionals 
across the country were taken aback by 
the recent swell in birth control prices at 
college health centers. Part of the rea
son for the sticker shock is that almost 
nobody saw it coming.
The price increase came as a result of 
the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), 
spending cuts that the Republican con
gress passed to make up for the federal 
governments empty change purse. The 
legislation made dramatic changes to 
reduce government payments through 
an array of programs, including Medi
care, Medicaid, and numerous federal 
higher education programs. The impact 
on birth control prices at college health 
centers is a side effect of a law, which 
is unlikely to save the government any 
money.
College women, on the other hand, are 
left to take the hit. With prices on cer
tain birth control medications surging 
by more than 400 percent, many women 
will be forced to pay the difference, 
switch to a generic oral contraceptive 
that will still be more expensive, or use
Carnegie Mellon is trying to put the 
convenience back into convenience 
store.
Campus Services, which oversees 
both Dining Services and University 
Stores, has begun drafting two plans 
to completely remodel and relocate the 
University Centers Entropy convenience 
store. While the plans are only propos
als for now, both options involve a much 
larger store, relocated to the area in the 
UC adjacent to the pool. They also fea
ture convenience store items in addition
On March 21, the Allegheny County 
Health Department fined the Lithu
anian Citizens Society of Western 
Pennsylvania a penalty of $16,250 for 
the latters failure to comply with the 
countys workplace smoking ban.
However steep, this fine was a neces
sary step for Pittsburgh. The workplace 
smoking ban will not be taken seriously 
unless it is enforced. This was the Health 
Departments first fine in conjunction 
with the ban, which has been in place 
since January 2.
Like Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon 
could benefit from stricter policy en
a non-prescription contraceptive. Many 
students are already on tight budgets, 
and the new pricing would mean nearly 
an extra $150 per year even for those 
who switch to generic medications. 
Whether or not the price increases will 
result in students practicing unsafe 
sex is impossible to predict, but easy to 
imagine.
At Carnegie Mellon, about 800 
women purchase birth control at Health 
Services, so the local impact of this 
change is significant.
According to the American College 
Health Association (ACHA), some health 
centers used the revenues from the sales 
of the deeply discounted contraceptives 
to fund health promotion programs and 
sexual health education programs, in
cluding education concerning the health 
risks of AIDS and other sexually trans
mitted diseases, free or low-cost PAP,- 
STD, and HIV testing services, and free 
condoms. At other health centers, the 
discounts made it possible for women 
under severe financial constraints to 
receive the contraceptives at no cost
to a broader selection of groceries, in
cluding fresh fruits and vegetables.
Tim Michael, the assistant vice presi
dent of Campus Services, is optimistic 
about the plan. According to Michael, 
prices should stay the same, but students 
will get an added value from the larger 
space, as well as the expanded selection. 
Assuming everything goes as intended, 
the new Entropy will be an improve
ment to the campus cornerstone.
Were in favor of the new Entropy 
as long as it remains independent of
forcement. Under the current policy, 
last updated in 2003, students are not 
allowed to smoke within 20 feet of en
trances to campus facilities.
In spite of this rule, its nearly impossi
ble to walk by Baker Hall without seeing 
at least one smoker standing within 20 
feet of an entrance. Moreover, many of 
the designated smoking areas on cam
pus (marked by those short cigarette 
disposals) are also within 20 feet of the 
entrances to buildings.
In fact, there is even a designated 
smoking area immediately next to a main 
entrance to the UC. If the UC, a hub for
inflate
whatsoever. Now, those programs will 
lose that funding source, causing people 
to miss out on these vitally important 
programs.
What makes the change seem more 
unjust is that the DRA is a solution 
to budget shortfalls largely resulting 
from President Bushs tax cuts, which 
disproportionately benefited Americas 
wealthiest individuals, and the exceed
ingly expensive war in Iraq.
Fortunately, there is a chance that 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) may alter the imple
mentation of the DRA to enable college 
health centers to get the discounts they 
received previously. The ACHA is lobby
ing the CMS to do just that.
The impact of the DRA on the health 
of students is significant, and Congress 
or the CMS should take quick action to 
reverse the problem.
Until that happens, though, boy
friends on campus should step up to the 
plate and split the increased cost of the 
birth control from which they clearly 
benefit.
Parkhurst, the primary provider of 
dining on campus. If Entropy is taken 
over by Parkhurst, its current manage
ment and student employees might be 
out of their jobs. The Entropy employ
ees are valued members of our campus 
community.
Once the plans are finalized, expect 
the new Entropy to open sometime next 
semester. Heres hoping that Carnegie 
Mellon can make it happen and give the 
campus community something it has 
long been asking for.
student activity on campus, cant even 
follow the smoking policy, how are its 
students supposed to take it seriously?
According to an article in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, since the fine, 
the Lithuanian Citizens Society has cre
ated a workplace smoking policy for its 
employees, in addition to posting no 
smoking signs in the building.
If our campus smoking policy was 
enforced, perhaps our campus would 
become a cleaner, healthier place. Carn
egie Mellon can still reap much of the 
benefit a smoking ban if it were to imple

As of this editorials printing I have 49 
days to figure out my life.
That may sound overdramatic, but 
it certainly doesnt feel that way. The 
list of considerations a senior under
graduate student must take reads like 
a Choose Your Own Adventure book or 
an especially diabolical version of that 
study-hall favorite, M.A.S.H.:
 Will you choose graduate school or 
work?
 If you chose work, what kind of job 
do you want to have?
 Are you actually qualified for any of 
thosejobs?
 How much a year do you want to 
make?
 Will that ever actually happen?
 Where do you want to live?
 Can you conceivably afford an 
apartment there?
 What kind of a car do you want to 
drive?
You get the idea. Its a lot to think 
about on top of regular work and extra
curricular demands. Theres definitely 
a reason that a large number of stu
dents start attending Counseling and 
Psychological Services in their senior 
year. Just when you start to feel as
though youve settled into a tolerable 
groove, you plunge headfirst into un
certainty.
It was earlier this semester, as I floun
dered around with my vague future 
plans of Making Money and Saving the 
World, that someone offered me a novel 
suggestion: Stay where you are. Re
maining in Pittsburgh would at least let 
me keep my feet on the ground, rather 
than graduating and uprooting myself 
all at once.
I shouldnt have been surprised, 
but I was. I like Pittsburgh just fine (in 
fact, while in a cooperative program 
in Washington, D.C. I wrote an edito
rial extolling the Burghs virtues) but 
never once had I considered staying 
here post-college. Im not alone. For 
years, Pittsburgh has suffered from an
 infamous brain drain, as bright young 
whippersnappers from the citys col
leges and universities walk down the 
aisle and then bolt out of town, diplo
mas clutched in their sweaty little fists.
For a college graduate in a highly 
transitional time of life, Pittsburgh is 
actually ideal. I finally sat down and 
decided to formally weigh the pros and 
cons of a fifth year in the Iron City.
First, the pros: One of the most ap
pealing factors is that Pittsburgh has 
an absolute ton of available and af
fordable housing. You can get a swank 
apartment near a commercial center 
for $800 a month. Compare that to my 
home state of New Jersey, where an 
apartment in the middle of the suburbs 
will run you $1000 a month, and youll 
probably have to pour water down the 
toilet to get it to flush. If you dont like 
apartments, theres plenty of single-unit 
dwellings with green space for rent.
Yes, yes, I hear you all saying, but 
what about a job to pay the rent checks? 
Carnegie Mellon students seem to be
infatuated with the idea of a decrepit, 
desolate, jobless Pittsburgh populated 
only by crumpled retirees. Has anyone 
actually looked for a job in Pittsburgh? 
Its labor market might not have the 
breadth of New Yorks, but keep in mind 
that there are few urban centers that do. 
Pittsburgh does have jobs. A fair num
ber of them, in almost every field. As I 
searched for jobs in the nonprofit sector, 
I was pleased to find that there were a 
number of positions available in muse
ums, policy centers, foundations, and 
charity groups.
Here you all chime in and tell me 
that once I get out and start working, 
Ill never have any fun, because theres 
nothing to do in Pittsburgh, guys. You 
may also bring up the recent story of 
actress Sienna Miller and her less-thanflattering description of the city. Well, 
Sienna never got off her bony derrire 
and left her hotel room, and youve 
clearly never ventured past Oakland. 
There are a seemingly endless num
ber of cool places to eat, more bars per 
capita than any other city in the United 
States (at least it feels that way to me), a 
cultural district, sporting events, movie 
theaters, a handful of concert venues, 
clubs (of little consequence to me, as 
Im not a huge clubgoer), and galleries. 
Thanks to the collegiate population, 
Pittsburghs social scene is not only vi
brant, but safe and manageable. Its not 
completely overwhelming, as the New 
York scene can be. And unlike New
York, people here are nice. Dont under
estimate the power of friendly locals.
Lest I sound too much like a Pitts
burgh networking brochure, lets talk 
about the cons. Because there are cons. 
For instance, everything I wrote above 
has a major caveat: You need a car to get 
anywhere worthwhile. That includes 
everything from the supermarket to 
Kennywood. Pittsburgh does have a 
transportation system, and while its 
perfectly adequate for a workday com
mute or simple errands, the buses arent 
timely and the routes seriously curtail 
a residents ability to explore lesserknown neighborhoods.
And for people used to a larger ur
ban or suburban setting, Pittsburgh can 
sometimes feel provincial. My first year 
at Carnegie Mellon, I remember being 
frightened by the surreal hush the city 
had during Sundays and religious holi
days. On Easter I couldnt even find an 
open supermarket or convenience store, 
let alone a place to have lunch. Pitts
burgh isnt the proverbial Pennsyltucky, 
but its also not very far away.
There are other things about 
Pittsburgh that I love, like the 
gravity-defying way houses seem to 
grow out of hillsides. And there are 
plenty of things that drive me crazy: the 
weather, the serious deficit of Dunkin 
Donuts. Even now, with the clock liter
ally ticking away, I dont know if I will 
be able  or choose  to stay here. But 
while I feel as though all of my plans 
are up in the air, its good to know that 
I have the option of staying rooted, and 
wont lose anything for it.

majoring in ethics, history and public pol

Child obesity remedy requires parenting, not public service ads
Warm weather ushers in skanky clothing and PDA in the clusters
Rachael Clemmons
I cant say that Pittsburgh 
weather hasnt been gracious as 
of late. There has been a string of 
days with 60 to 70 temperatures 
without snow in between, and 
for that, I am a little bit thank
ful. But otherwise 1 am pretty 
unenthusiastic about the conse
quences of such warm weather. 
In fact, Im irritated. Is Carnegie 
Mellon the same school after that 
vernal equinox thing?
Sure, Ill admit that the 
newfound springtime social 
atmosphere surrounding me is a 
little tempting. (But just a little.) I 
think Ive had roughly 60 percent 
less awkward encounters since 
the sun came out. In the very 
first months of the fall semester, 
and the very last months of the 
spring semester, everyone here 
is overflowing with social en
deavors. Their ability to socialize 
goes up, while their aptitude for 
awkwardness goes down quite a 
bit. Can you imagine what CMU 
would be like if more months 
were like this? People would be 
socially refined instead of so
cially awkward! Wouldnt that be 
an unusual sight?
And yet, the spring weather
still promises some levels of ab
surdity. For example: People 
really dont know what to wear 
in this weather. Someone gets 
excited because its a little over 
50, and then they are just about 
wearing a bathing suit to class. 
Things like this make me ner
vous. I worry about the sanity of 
my peers. If people arent wearing 
bikinis and swim trunks, they are 
wearing a winter jacket when its 
70. It really isnt that hard to be 
prepared for the weather, espe
cially when you can look up the 
daily forecast on the Internet.
This 70 weather does not 
mean that skanky clothes are 
acceptable. Skanky clothes are 
really only acceptable at night, 
in dark rooms. And dark room 
or not, I really dont want to see 
your ass. Ive seen about three 
flashes of gluteus maximus since 
the onset of warm weather. It 
isnt particularly attractive when 
celebrities let body parts slip out 
and land their privates on the 
front of a trashy magazine, so 
you should know it isnt accept
able when you do it. Especially 
when I have to see it. I may not 
be known to be particularly lady
like, but I certainly dont flash my 
humps to passers-by on my way 
to class. Even when Im feeling 
generous.
I can sympathize  I under
stand that Pittsburgh is not the 
easiest place to adjust to, temperature-wise. The weather is 
bipolar here. Pittsburgh has its 
own weather system because 
were stuck in this valley. For all 
I know, everything outside of 
the valley, and over the moun
tains (and across the river, and 
through the forest) could be 
wonderful. People might know 
how to wear weather-appropri
ate clothes there because they 
arent confused by the inconsis
tencies between the seasons. I 
understand that warm weather 
is really exciting and you want 
to break out the clothes you 
havent worn since August, but I 
dont think a little modesty  or 
knowledge of what temperature 
it will be on a certain day  is 
too much to ask.
Maybe the warm weather has 
such drastic effects on students 
because Pittsburgh is one of 
the most depressed cities in the 
United States. In fact, its number 
67which isnt awful, but is still 
bad enough, especially when you 
consider how many cities there 
are in America, So when the 
snow melts, the sun shines, and 
rabbits and squirrels come out to 
play (ok, not really), people get a 
little too happy. Students moods
are drastically lifted, and people 
smile like they dont know what 
smiling is. Which brings me to 
my next complaint about warm 
weather: It gets peoples hor
mones going. All over the place.
I recently witnessed some fugs 
making out in a computer cluster. 
Have some respect! The cluster 
is a place for peace and procras
tination, not the swapping of 
dangerous germs via foaming 
mouths. Someone could get hurt! 
And if no liquids are allowed in 
clusters, dont you think it would 
be safer if you dismounted your 
(somewhat) significant other? Its 
better for us all if you bring down 
your estrogen levels, or your tes
tosterone levels, or whatever is 
making you so excited. Also, you 
should probably get a room.
After I witnessed the unsightly 
make-out session in the cluster, I 
saw a bunch of prospective stu
dents going on a campus tour. 
These kids come to visit Carnegie 
Mellon and get a false perspec
tive on what the university is 
like. They come here and see 
the sun shining, students laugh
ing and playing Frisbee on the 
Cut, Walking to the Sky glisten
ing, etc. Dont you think thats 
false advertising? Prospective 
students need to see the hard 
winter nights at the library, the
sleep-deprived corpses stum
bling around the Cut, and two 
gigantic snowballs placed stra
tegically in front of Walking to 
the Sky. What about those fun 
times? Why doesnt Admissions 
offer tours for them? I actu
ally prefer those somber times. 
Everyone smiling and holding 
hands and giggling makes me 
more than nauseous.
It is amazing how different 
this whole campus is from 
November through February. 
Random people dont swap spit 
in clusters, for example, in the 
winter. People dont flash their 
body parts in the winter. (Well, 
maybe at frat parties, but not 
while Im crossing Forbes or 
when Im sitting outside of the 
library.) If Im a cynic for pre
ferring the winter months, so 
be it  they are less visually 
offensive.
Though I am grateful for the 
recent warm weather, I dont 
appreciate its effects on CMUs 
population. Besides, I dont 
know how to handle Carnegie 
Mellon when it isnt filled with 
awkward people. Cold, horrible 
months, please come back.
Rachael Clemmons (rclemmon@J is awkward, even when 
the sun comes out.

Obesity has been touted as the 
new American epidemic. With 
140 million American adults 
clinically overweight or obese, it 
is certainly a valid national health 
concern. And, unfortunately, it 
appears that the epidemic is now 
spreading rapidly to American 
children. According to the 
American Obesity Association, 
30.3 percent of American kids 
between the ages of 6 and 11 are 
overweight, and 15.5 percent are 
obese.
A study by the Kaiser Family 
Foundation released last Wednes
day seems to point the finger of 
blame at the extreme number 
of televised food commercials 
that children see. According to 
the study, every year children 
between the ages of 3 and 7 see 
about 4400 food ads, kids aged 8 
to 12 view a whopping 7600 ads, 
and teens aged 13 to 17 see 6000 
ads. It comes as no surprise that 
a staggering number of these ad
vertisements are for candy and 
other unhealthy snacks, greasy 
fast-food joints, and soda.
The study is expected to have an 
impact on the regulation of food 
advertisements geared toward 
children. Agencies and groups 
like the Federal Communications 
Commission, the Center for 
Science in the Public Interest, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, 
and other medical and child ad
vocacy groups have been asking 
for some kind of regulation of 
advertisements that aim to sell 
food high in calories, fat, sugar, 
and salt to kids. The govern
ment has yet to impose any such 
regulations, but the National 
Advertising Review Council, an 
organization that advances self
regulation among advertisers, 
began its Childrens Food and 
Beverage Advertising Initiative 
last November. Eleven big fish in 
the advertising pond  including
McDonalds, The Coca-Cola Co., 
and PepsiCo. Inc.  have signed 
on to the initiative to change at 
least half of their advertisements 
to promote healthier diet and 
lifestyle choices.
And while were all waiting 
with bated breath for advertising 
giants to self-regulate, the Ad 
Council and the American Heart 
Association, among other groups, 
have banded together to form the 
Coalition for Healthy Children. 
The coalition plans to use Shrek 
characters to create ads that will 
aim to get children to exercise 
and eat healthy foods. The Kaiser 
Foundations study did point out 
that children see very few public 
service announcements. Kids un
der eight see one health-directed 
TV ad for every 26 food ads, preteens see one for every 48 food 
ads, and teens see one for every 
130 food ads.
The rush to create public ser
vice announcements (PSAs) 
to counteract food advertising 
seems futile. For one thing, the 
effectiveness of public service 
announcements is questionable. 
Admittedly, PSAs have come a 
long way, even over the last few 
years: Anti-drug campaigns have 
intelligently switched their mes
sages from the alarmist, Dont 
smoke marijuana because you 
might hit an elderly man with 
your car while high, (Remem
ber that one?) to a more realistic 
and subtle, If you get stoned all 
the time, youll end up sitting 
on your couch all day and wont 
have a life. While this realismover-alarmism approach is an 
important way of making tele
vised public service messages 
have more of an impact, the large 
majority of youths could still care 
less about talking heads preach
ing to them from the TV screen.
Though it is certainly a smart 
move on the part of the Coalition 
for Healthy Children to use popu
lar movie characters to lure kids 
into their message in the same 
way that food advertisements
often capture the youth demo
graphic, fighting fire with fire 
still doesnt get down to the root 
of the problem. Even if kids do 
watch Shrek and Donkey playing 
soccer outside or eating apples 
instead of a Snickers bar, theyll 
still be sitting in front of the TV, 
munching on Doritos or having 
a Coke. The best way to prevent 
and eradicate child obesity prob
ably isnt having them passively 
absorb health-centric messages 
while being a couch potato in 
front of the television.
The best way to prevent and 
eradicate child obesity would be 
to turn off the TV altogether. See
ing as kids arent likely to switch 
off the television of their own ac
cord, its the job of their parents. 
Advertising is only going to get 
a whole lot more pervasive in 
our culture. Relying on televised 
public service announcements 
to counteract the bombardment 
of ads is useless and dim-wit
ted. PSAs are no replacement for 
parenting.
It is the responsibility of par
ents not only to ensure that their 
children are eating nutritiously, 
but also that they are physically 
active and healthy. To expect 
or require food producers to cut 
back on their marketing implies
Huang/Art Staff
that neither parents nor chil
dren have the desire or ability 
to think independently of ad
vertisements. Though younger 
kids may not have the ana
lytical skills necessary to see 
through advertisers market
ing schemes, parents certainly 
should. And since parents con
trol the finances, its as simple 
as not buying foods like ice 
cream or treating the kids to 
McDonalds.
Kelly Cahill (kpahill@J has par
ents who forced her to play 
outside for HOURS as a child, for 
which she thanks them warmly.

The mens team also played 
Denison and Kenyon, win
ning both matches. The wins 
increased the Tartans season 
record to 15-3.
The mens tennis team traveled 
to Greenville, Ohio on Wednes
day to play Denison, defeating 
the Big Red 5-4. With the loss, 
Denison dropped to 4-4 for the 
season.
First-year James Muliawan 
defeated his Denison opponent, 
Randy Lofgren, in the numberone singles match 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
First-year Jon Spero and sopho
more Yiran Liu also won their 
singles matches by scores of 7-5, 
6-3 and 6-3, 6-1, respectively.
Junior Andrew Clearfield de
feated Denison player Kevin 
Newman 6-0, 6-2, and senior
Jordan Koslosky overtook Char
lie Poe 6-4, 6-3 to secure the 
Tartans win.
The Tartans tacked on an
other win on Sunday when they 
defeated Kenyon 5-4 in another 
close match.

tan mens 4x400-meter relay A 
team placed second with a time 
of 3:27.71. The 4x800-meter re
lay A team finished fourth with 
a time of 8:33.29.
On the womens side, in the 
800-meter run, sophomore 
Ashley Bakelmun (2:29.04) 
led the team with a sixth-place 
finish. Behind Bakelmun, firstyears Diane Mattingly (2:30.18) 
and Crystal LeePow (2:37.08) 
finished eighth and 15th, 
respectively.
Sophomore Emily Giacomarra 
took 13th in the 100-meter hur
dles with a time of 18.10.
It feels great to be running 
outside, since it gets stuffy on 
the indoor tracks, Bakelmun 
said. The beautiful weather 
this week has made it even more 
enjoyable. The outdoor season 
is always exciting because the 
times are faster around the regu
lar-sized track.
Sophomore Carolyn Clay
ton finished sixth in the 
3000-meter run with a time of 
11:22.62, while senior Jerri Cas
tillo (5:12.13) took 14th in the 
1500-meter run.

Sophomore Jessica Meng 
placed in the top 10 for the high 
jump and long jump events. 
Meng jumped 1.53 meters for 
eighth place in the high jump and 
finished 10th in the long jump 
(4.56 meters).
In the pole vault, first-year 
Anna Lenhart (2.60 meters) and 
sophomore Heidi Grothaus (2.60 
meters) took fifth and eighth, 
respectively.
Senior Becky Metier threw 
for 11.08 meters to take ninth in 
the shot put. Metier also finished 
13th in the discus throw (30.51 
meters) and seventh in the 
hammer throw (42.40 meters). 
The 4x400-meter relay A team 
(4:19.91) finished the day with a 
fourth-place finish.
We lost a few people from the 
indoor season and gained a few 
people as well, so we are still ad
justing to that, Bakelmun said. 
There is a lot of potential in the 
younger athletes that joined the 
team.
The track and field team will 
return home to host Allegheny

Over the course of the sea
son, which has included almost 
20 games, the Carnegie Mellon 
mens tennis team has managed 
to lose only three. This streak 
has largely been due to the out
standing play of the teams firstyear Jon Spero. This week The 
Tartan sat down with Spero to 
talk about his season.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing tennis?
Spero: I started playing 
around with a racket when I 
was about four, and then started 
competing at all sorts of differ
ent clubs when I was 11.
T: Was tennis a part of your 
decision to come to Carnegie 
Mellon?
S: Definitely. I was recruited 
by a couple of other schools, 
both Division I and III, but in 
the end I really wanted to come 
here. We have such a competi
tive team thats really on the 
rise, and have so many oppor
tunities ahead of us with such a 
young team. Also the academics 
provided by Teppers business 
program really attracted me to 
the school.
T: As a first-year, how have 
you been handling athletics and 
academics? *
S: In the fall it wasnt bad at
all; I really didnt have any is
sues with the two. Since spring 
break though, really the past 
couple of weeks, it has gotten 
a little harder, but you work 
through it.
T: Do you have any pre-match 
superstitions or rituals?
S: I dont have any rituals. Ive 
had a couple superstitions, but 
Ive mostly given up on them 
now. In high school I had one 
that if I lost a match, I would 
never play in that shirt again. I 
had good shirts and bad shirts. 
I also had one that during a 
match, in between points, I 
would never step on the lines. 
I dont know the theory behind 
it, but thats a big thing with lots 
of players.
T: Favorite place youve got
ten to travel for tennis?
S: California for training over 
spring break was pretty nice, 
but my absolute favorite was 
Naples, Fla., where I went for a 
tournament in high school.
T: Any accomplishments you 
are particularly proud of?
S: In high school, I won 
WPIALs high school regionals 
my sophomore year. Also, in 
2004,1 got into this tournament 
that consisted of the best 192 
players in the country, and won 
three matches there. Then ear
lier this fall I played really well 
at the ITA tournament.
T: Do you have a most memo
rable match?
S: The tournament I men
tioned from 2004. It was 
the National Hardcore 
Championships; it was the tour
nament to get into, so making 
the cut and getting to go was 
such a big deal to me.
T: Do you have any goals?
S: For the season, I would 
really like to qualify for NCAAs 
as a team. Emory always wins, 
and getting in is really tough 
so well have to be ranked re
ally well. Then sometime in the 
next three years I have here at 
Carnegie Mellon, Id like to qual
ify individually for the NCAA 
tournament. In singles, its the 
top 32 players in the country, so 
its a tough goal.
SPORTS COMMENTAR;*
Lets play some baseball!
Doug Fricker
David Kjos/Art Editor
Baseballs back. The cracking sound of 
the bat hitting the ball or the smacking of 
the ball in the glove is like^music to my ears. 
As we bid adieu to college basketball to
night (good riddance Joachim Noah and his 
over-dramatizations), baseball will take the 
proverbial baton and pick up where March 
Madness left off, minus the March and mi
nus the madness.
The baseball season began last night as 
the St. Louis Cardinals took on the New 
York Mets in a rematch of last years Na
tional League Championship Series that the 
Cardinals won on their way to becoming 
World Series Champions.
For the majority of the league, how
ever, today is opening day, as teams get 
their first test of whether they have what 
it takes to become this years World Series 
Champions. Theyll see how their off-sea
son transactions panned out and whether
or not their fans have something to be ex
cited about this season.
Ill tell you right now, if you are a fan of 
the Washington Nationals, Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays, or Kansas City Royals, circle the home 
openers for the Redskins, Buccaneers, and 
Chiefs. Actually Ill go one step further and 
suggest getting a new favorite team. Like 
the Cubs or the Pirates.
The Pirates played decent baseball in the 
second half of last season; the problem was 
they stunk it up at the beginning. As I said 
last year, they are still a young team, but 
they will continue to make strides. Their 
young pitchers struggled at times last year, 
not playing up to expectations. The big 
news for the Pirates is the acquisition of first 
baseman Adam LaRoche from Atlanta. He 
is expected to bat fourth and provide some 
much-needed power in the lineup.
National League (NL) batting champion 
and second baseman Freddy Sanchez has 
a sore right knee and will start the season 
on the disabled list. The injury is not serious 
and Sanchez is expected to be back in the 
lineup in a week or less.
Two keys for the Pirates this season will 
be the successes of their lead-off hitter and 
their closer. Center fielder Chris Duffy is 
penciled in as the lead-off hitter, but he 
needs to prove he can consistently get the 
job done at the top. If he doesnt get on base 
regularly, the Pirates offense will struggle.
The Pirates gave up closer Mike Gonzalez 
in order to bring in LaRoche, so the reins 
have been turned over to Salomon Torres. 
Torres replaced an injured Gonzalez in Sep
tember last season and led the league in 
saves for the month. He will need to brush 
off his poor spring training performance 
and get the job done in the ninth inning. The 
Pirates cant afford to let wins slip through
their fingers, as the demoralizing losses will 
hurt the young teams confidence.
The Cubs spent money in the offsea
son, ignoring the phrase that money cant 
buy happiness. They hired Lou Piniella 
as manager and spent $136 million on an 
eight-year contract with outfielder Alfonso 
Soriano. Derrek Lee (hes healthy again) 
and Aramis Ramirez will wake up the mid
dle of the batting order and will provide the 
pop for this team to rise to the top.
The Cubs will again be without Mark 
Prior and Kerry Wood at the start of the sea
son, but they have actually taken steps this 
season to win without them by signing'Ted 
Lilly and Jason Marquis, a couple of proven 
starting pitchers.
St. Louiss Albert Pujols returns as argu
ably the best player in baseball. He edges 
Philadelphia first baseman Ryan Howard, 
New York Mets shortstop Jose Reyes, Min
nesota pitcher Johan Santana, Yankees 
third baseman Alex Rodriguez, and Soriano 
for the top honor.
Only a handful of superstars swapped 
jerseys in the off-season, with pitcher Barry 
Zito leaving Oakland for a better deal in San 
Francisco, Carlos Lee signing with Houston, 
and Soriano with the Cubs.
Six different teams have won the last six 
World Series and I see this trend continuing 
in 2007. Anything could happen, so Im go
ing with the Cubs winning the NL Central 
and the Pirates winning the wild card as 
theyll take a page out of the Penguins book 
and make the playoffs.
Im a realist, though, and this is where 
their dreams end. The Los Angeles Dodgers 
will win the NL pennant and play the New 
York Yankees for the World Series title, and 
the Yankees will win their first World Series 
since 2000.

Stained glass and the Pittsburgh potty
Unique features of old houses in the Burgh
Everything you need to know
About sweet escapes and sweet dreams 
Dear Janet, Dear Janet,
FOR SALE: Charming three-bedroom home. 
Decorative fireplace, stained glass windows, 
garage, one bathroom, two basements. $198,000.
'TIs the season for room draw, which means 
many students are thinking about dorms and 
university apartments. But what about living in a 
house off campus?
While this house does not actually exist, many of 
its features are characteristic of the older homes 
in Pittsburgh. It may sound as if it has all of the 
necessary amenities  plus a few extras, like 
a second basement and stained glass windows
 but it turns out that some of these "perks" are 
worth avoiding. Whether youre new to the area 
or not, read on to discover (or rediscover) some of 
the features unique to Pittsburgh homes.
Imagine arriving at this house, only to find 
carpeting on all of the floors. As a prospective 
buyer, you might have really wanted hardwood. 
Dont give up yet! In many Pittsburgh homes, 
for one reason or another, hardwood floors 
are covered up by carpeting. They may not, 
however, be new or even pretty. Coldwell Banker 
agent Linda Corcoran, who operates from the 
company's Squirrel Hill branch, said, "Because 
[the floors] are hidden, we dont know what 
kind of condition theyre in until we tear up the 
carpeting."
The next surprising find in this "charming" house 
is that the garage is actually unusable (at least for 
your car). Because Pittsburgh is full 
of hills, there are some very steep 
driveways. In these areas, it's 
almost impossible to park your 
car  and even harder 
to get back out on the 
street.
Another problem 
caused by having a 
house on a hill is steep 
stairs leading up to 
your door. If you dont 
relish the idea of
climbing up steep stairs in Pittsburghs humid 
summers and icy winters, be sure to look for 
a house on a level area of the street. This way, 
you'll have a usable driveway and/or garage, 
and walking to your front door wont be an uphill 
battle.
And now, for the truly bizarre: the second 
basement. Often, second basements are the 
result of an addition to the home. Having a 
second basement may sound useful, as it 
provides additional storage space and the 
possibility of an extra room. However, in reality, 
most of these basements can only be entered 
from the outside and are usually unfinished.
With a little time (and some money), the second 
basement can be turned into a usable room.
This fictional Pittsburgh home also includes 
a fireplace and stained-glass windows. The 
fireplace is listed as "decorative" in the ad, but 
that doesnt mean that its pretty; it means it 
doesnt work. Again, dont give up  it still 
might. "We list fireplaces as decorative because 
we cant know the condition of the chimney," 
said Corcoran.
With a little investigation, you may find yourself 
the owner of a fully functioning fireplace. We 
have a fireplace with a mantelpiece with deer 
heads and bear heads [at my house], said 
junior computer science major Kim Weston, a 
Pittsburgh native.
Stained glass windows are also common in 
Pittsburgh. Corcoran estimates that about 
50 percent of older homes have stained glass 
windows. She said, "They add aesthetic and 
character value to the home."
There is one more issue to address: Your house 
has three bedrooms... and only one bathroom? 
Don't worry, we're in Pittsburgh  things may 
not be as they seem. There is often a "bathroom" 
in the basement of older homes, usually referred 
to as a Pittsburgh potty." This is a toilet, 
and possibly a shower, situated in a corner of 
the basement without being closed off. The 
Pittsburgh potty wont be listed in the real estate 
section, but if you want a second bathroom (and 
some privacy), all youll have to do is build some 
walls.
Now that you've uncovered some of the hidden, 
unique, and just plain cool features of older 
Pittsburgh homes, you should be prepared to do 
some local house hunting  especially if your 
room draw number leaves something to be 
desired.

I recently got a great 
opportunity to go live in Japan 
for one to two years. Im very 
excited about this and think 
it could be very good for me. 
However, some of my friends 
and family are against it 
because they dont want me 
to be so far away. I understand 
their concerns, but I ve thought 
this through very carefully and 
it really is the best course for 
me right now. How can I help 
my loved ones see what a 
great experience this will be 
and how important it is to me 
that I get their blessing?
Guilty to Go
Dear GTG,
Youve made up your mind, and 
youre figuring out yen conversion 
rates, youre excited to pick up 
ail those Japanese-only video 
games to ship to your friends at 
home. All youre searching for is 
the approval and support of your 
friends and family. Here's what I 
think, GTG: drop this guilty crap. 
When else in-your life can you 
pick up and go to Japan besides 
in your early 20s? I mean, please. 
If you cant have an experience 
like this now when youre not tied 
down, when will you? Im sure 
your friends and family will miss 
you, but what do they expect you 
to do, hang around Pittsburgh 
and deliver pizzas for the next two 
years? Explain to them that this is 
your chance to see the world and 
explore what you want to do with 
your life. They love you. Theyll 
support you. They're just worried 
' about missing you.
Janet
I actually have kind of an 
awkward question for you. I 
dont know if its appropriate 
for the advice column. So, you 
know when youre sleeping in 
bed with a guy and neither 
of you wants to make out 
and thats fine? So,boys get 
erections as soon as they 
fall asleep, is the thing. And
I always feel weird and selfconscious about it. Do you 
notice?
Hugs Are Really Desirable 
Dear HARD,
Honestly, I think boys think girls 
notice erections more than girls 
actually do. I really wouldnt worry 
about it: If youre cuddled up 
sleeping with a.girl, especially if 
nothing sexual is happening, her 
attention is going to be elsewhere. 
Enjoy it! And honestly, so what 
if she does notice? Its 2007. I 
doubt shell have an attack of the 
vapors or something if confronted 
with Mother Natures handiwork. 
We all know how bodies work. 
So get some sleep!
Janet

La TempteThe Hush Sound and Mae play Mr. Smalls
Shakespeare + holograms
Last weekend, the Byham Theater hosted La Tempte, an 
adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest. Presented 
by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the performance was put 
on by 4D Art, a theater company based in Montreal. Sung 
entirely in French with English supertitles, La Tempte 
follows Shakespeare's original work very closely.
The story begins with Prospero (Richard Theriault), the 
deposed duke of Milan and student of the occult. Prosperos 
works are carried out through his servant, the spirit Ariel 
(Manon Brunellq). Antonio, Prosperos duplicitous brother, 
exiles Ariel and Miranda (Prospero's daughter, played by 
Maude Campeau) to a deserted island. Seeking revenge, 
Prospero summons a powerful storm, which shipwrecks his 
brother, along with Alfonso, the king of Naples.
Adding additional drama, La Tempte includes two attempts 
at murder, one aimed at Alfonso and the other at Prospero, 
both of which are foiled by Ariel at Prosperos request.
While pursuing revenge against his malefactors, Prospero, 
through Shakespearean moral instruction, winds up forgiving 
them instead, particularly when he sees Miranda fall in love 
with Ferdinand (Pierre Etienne Rouillard), Alfonsos son. A 
tragicomedy, La Tempte follows the cliched story of starcrossed lovers up to its happy ending.
Visually, La Tempte is a tour de force of the avant garde. A 
collaboration between Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon, 4D 
Art uses modern visual media in its presentations, resulting 
in a surreal appearance. Blending digital technology with live 
performances, La Tempte has some prerecorded actors who 
appear only on screen (read: two-thirds of the cast never sets 
foot on stage). Through the use of holograms, characters seem 
to appear and disappear into thin air. For example, Prospero 
turns his back on the audience and disappears the moment a 
spirit is projected on his back.
The Byham Theater stage was cleverly arranged. From afar, 
the set looked like a rocky shore, though it was actually made 
of piles of oversized books (in the story, Prospero's knowledge 
of magic came from his prodigious library). The acoustics 
setup, however, did not suit La Tempte; the setup lacked the 
ethereal quality that the visual aspects provided. La Tempte 
runs one-and-a-half hours without intermission, which makes 
it a lot to take in at once.
Theriault's performance stood out due to his overwhelming 
stage presence. His voice soared throughout La Tempte, 
but did not change with the story line. Playing a proud and 
initially vindictive Prospero, Theriault failed to adequately 
capture the turn to reconciliation.
Brunelle has perhaps the hardest role. In addition to Ariel, 
she played Caliban, a malicious hunchback who interacts 
physically with two projected actors, Trinculo (Robert Toupin) 
and Sebastien (Patrice Robitaille); she is supposed to be 
kicked around by them. It is one thing to wrestle with a giant 
cockroach,  la Men in Black, in front of a green screen, but 
quite another to choreograph it in a live performance:
A story of redemption and forgiveness, The Tempest serves as 
an excellent choice for 4D Art's visual style. The play (4D Art's 
first foray into Shakespeare) features many scenes of fantasy 
and dreamscapes in a reverie of sleep. La Tempte captures 
these perfectly, and 4D Art's abilities would serve ideally for 
MacBeths apparitions or Hamlet's ghosts.

New Atlantic, Sherwood warm up a crowd of hipsters
Last Thursday at Mr. Smalls Theater, New Atlantic, 
Sherwood, The Hush Sound, and Mae graced the stage 
for a spectacular performance.
New Atlantic was the first band to play.*The band, which 
hails from New Jersey, claims to "give a shit on their 
website, and will have a new album called The Streets, 
The Sounds, and The Love out on April 10. They also 
happen to be talented, as a visit to their music-infused 
website will show you.
The next band to play was Sherwood, a quartet of 
socially conscious guys with a lot of hair and even more 
heart. The lead singer, Nate Henry, also plays the bass
 a pleasant oddity in the world of musicians. Mike 
Leibovich, the keyboardist and tambourine man, danced 
while playing like he had nothing to lose, and was as 
entertaining to watch as the band's set in its entirety.
On the merch table, the band placed a collection jar and 
encouraged all attendees to donate money to dig wells in 
Africa.
been working on it since before we finished the last album. 
[Recordings] going awesome.
Morris described some of the things that influence The Hush 
Sounds music:
The bands upbringing: "[Bassist] Chris's parents put 
headphones on his mom's belly and played prog rock. We're 
still trying to knock that out of his head."
Current events: Most people know that Im pretty terrified of 
the world ending because I write about it all the time. I think 
that global warming is a pretty scary thing."
Other bands: "Listening to Saves the Day ... I would definitely 
say that that had to affect me somehow."
The Hush Sound also hopes to have an effect on its fans. 
Hopefully some of these kids will have an interest sparked 
by what Im saying ... and try and make a difference, Morris 
said.
Next up was The Hush Sound. Band members Bob 
Morris and Greta Salpeter have shared the duties, of 
lyric-writing since the band's first album, 2005's So 
Sudden. Morris, age 21, also plays guitar for the The 
Hush Sound.
"I think the shows go a lot better when we don't think 
about them at all, Morris said during a phone interview. 
"I know, for me, I tend to forget lyrics a lot. I really get 
nervous sometimes and that turns out to be the worst 
shows." Well, Morris didnt seem nervous on Thursday. 
The Hush Sound opened with the song We Intertwined, 
the first track off the band's most recent album, Like 
Vines.
The Hush Sound recently returned from Austin's South 
by Southwest festival, and its members are excited for 
the coming months. "We're hoping to record [the new 
album] in August or September," Morris said. We've
The band has a phenomenally close connection with its fan 
base, and even personally answers questions on its website, 
thehushsound.com. "You get more of an insight of who people 
are," Morris said. If a band I admired answered a question I 
asked, I'd feel really special and Id really pay attention ... to 
what they had to say.
The band finished its set with "Like Vines, the song everyone 
in th audience seemed to know. Before Maes set, the 
audience, composed primarily of hipper-than-thou teens,' sang 
along to middle-school throwback Matchbox 20 when one of 
its songs came over the speakers.
Mae took the stage amid cheers and applause, and the band 
succeeded in satisfying a room full of waiting fans. The 
band played crowd favorites, and the aforementioned crowd 
returned the favor by rocking out.

International Film Festival begins with Piter FM
Youth and Identity in global cinema
radio stationOn local artists
Last Thursday was the beginning of Carnegie Mellons 
Fourth International Film Festival: Youth and Identity. 
Each of the films selected represents one of the seven 
languages taught in the modern languages department 
(Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese 
and Chinese), and all of them relate to issues facing 
youths from around the world.
Free to the community, the International Film Festival 
began in 2004 with the goal of promoting foreign 
languages and increasing awareness of the cinema 
outside the U.S.. The theme of this year's festival, Youth 
and Identity, was chosen for its relevance to college 
students. The seven films all deal with recent issues; 
only one, Cinema Paiadiso, was produced before 2002.
This academic year in Pittsburgh has seen several 
successful film events including the Faces of Democracy 
Film Festival and the Three Rivers Film Festival. Like 
these others, the International Film Festival offers 
something to the community, explained Alyx Kronstein, 
a sophomore Russian studies major and one of the 
festival's student organizers. "This festival, because it is 
completely run by college students and undergraduates, 
it fits with us, Kronstein said. "It shows that college 
students can be valuable and breaks the stereotype that 
theyre too lazy or self-centered to care about film."
The festival opened with last Thursdays screening 
of Piter FM, a Russian romantic comedy set in St. 
Petersburg. Guests were also offered free Russian food, 
including Napoleon cake with layers of flaky pastry 
separating layers of cream.
In the film, Maksim (Yevgeni Tsyganov) is an architect 
who finds the ceil phone of Masha (Yekaterina 
Fedulova), an unconventional radio DJ. This causes 
several ill-conceived attempts for the two to meet 
so Maksim can return the phone. The film portrays 
Russias youth in the optimistic and playful culture of 
St. Petersburg. To highlight this representation, the film 
playfully juxtaposed giggly young girls and punk-rockish 
guys with boring adult characters. The best scenes 
were not on film, but right in the audience; it was a 
pleasure to watch several of the Russian professors
eyes light up as they laughed along with the crowd.
All of the films will play in McConomy. The schedule is 
as follows:
7 p.m., April 4  The Beat That My Heart Skipped

Its common to hear complaints about Pittsburghs horrible music 
scene  remarks about how many venues have been closed 
down, how many mainstream bands bypass Pittsburgh on national 
tours, or even how nothing creative comes out of Pittsburgh. These 
statements are totally untrue, especially the last one. To prove it, 
heres a list of local bands that are starting to gain national attention 
(at least within their genres).
Caustic Christ. Formed in 2000, Caustic Christ is a hardcore punk 
band akin to Municipal Waste and the Subhumans. Caustic Christ 
has toured throughout the US and Europe. When in Pittsburgh, the 
band often plays at the Mr. Roboto Project, which is a cooperatively 
run show space in Wilkinsburg.
Xanopticon. If youve been to an electronic show in Pittsburgh, 
youve probably seen Xanopticon open. Remember the guy in the 
black hoodie with the long greasy hair? Wait, thats everyone. Well, 
he was probably the opener, twitching spastically on the crossfader, 
thinking melodies are unnecessary. If youre into breakcore, which 
redefines the meaning of relentless," then Xanopticons a decent 
choice. Check him out at basically any Garfield Artworks show thats 
even kind of relevant.
Grand Buffet. Pittsburgh is also home to a burgeoning hip-hop 
scene, and Grand Buffet is right there at its forefront. A duo made up 
of two Pittsburgh natives, theyve been producing satirical hip-hop 
with a local bent for 10 years, and have long been known for their 
entertaining (usually with lots of audience participation) shows. Now, 
theyre starting to get really big, having just toured with Of Montreal 
and played with Sage Francis, Sole, Magnolia Electric Co., and 
Wesley Willis. You should probably look into their shows before they 
get as bigas...
Girl Talk: You already know all about him. Or, if you dont, just go 
read Pitchfork or Stylus or something - hes an indie darling. Still 
a nice guy, though; he was only playing basement shows last year 
and is already getting international contracts. Still, you can catch 
him around Pittsburgh for cheap fairly often. No one is able to make 
stoic indie kids dance like him, and its not possible to interact with 
the crowd more. (Last year, when he opened for Prefuse 73 on 
campus, he smashed a mic into his head, drawing blood, and told 
the audience to call University Police on a girl for having too much 
fun." Definitely a fun night.)

Frozen: Thawing the past
Students tackle a difficult script
The School of Drama has maintained a long-standing 
tradition of interpreting and staging works in startling and 
innovative ways. This past weeks presentation of Frozen
 written by British playwright Bryony Lavery and directed 
by Robert May, a senior drama major  was no exception to 
this tradition.
The storyline of Frozen revolves around two central figures
 a pedophiliac serial killer named Ralph, and Nancy, 
the mother of one of Ralph's victims (Rhona, who is never 
actually seen in the play). Exploring the concepts of human 
connections, forgiveness, and frozen" emotions, the 
performance moves along through direct address, where 
the story is told through monologues by each of the three 
characters (the third is a supporting character, Agnetha,
a professor researching the minds of serial killers). Ralph, 
Nancy, and Agnetha were played by three junior drama 
majors  Michael McKee, Emily Rossell, and Tro Shaw, 
respectively.
Primarily, Frozen examines the human tendency to gravitate, 
linger, and feed off fueling emotions (such as vengeance). 
Each of the plays characters experiences emotional 
standstills  Nancy wants vindication for her daughters 
death, Ralph cant comprehend the wrongs of his actions, 
Agnetha is pining for her recently deceased  though when 
alive, very married!  colleague. Unfortunately, despite 
Ralph's twisted, "serial killer" personality, the moral core of 
the story felt cliched. The plays messages, such as "forgive 
and move on, were less than engaging due to their general 
ubiquity.
More original was the presence of science in the script, 
which was evidently aimed toward an educated audience. 
Facts about cortisol's destructive properties to the brain in 
high amounts  or the size disparities between the brains 
of normal people and those of serial killers  help make the 
story more cohesive. Shaws clean voice delivered one of 
the plays best lines: "The difference between a crime of evil 
and a crime of illness is the difference between a sin and a 
symptom," she says, describing Ralph's inability to recognize 
his actions as wrong.
While the language of Frozen was beautiful  particularly 
during Nancys monologues  and each character 
demonstrated convincingly independent attributes through 
speech patterns, the establishments of character couldn't 
finish the story. Ralphs repetitions of the word "obviously," 
and his echoing choruses of "hello, hello, hello, Nancy's 
descriptive, anecdotal manner of speaking, and Agnetha's 
abrupt, high-strung way-of talking about Ralph all added 
richness to the play, but were not enough to push the action 
toward closure.
The frustrating lack of conflict resolution was rooted mostly 
in Nancys final decision to forgive Ralph for his murder 
and sexual violation of Rhona, which comes after Nancy is 
somehow able to get Ralph to understand the pain he must 
have caused her daughter. Neither Nancys slide toward 
forgiveness nor Ralphs induced understanding of his crime 
were adequately addressed in the script. Nancys decision 
was abrupt, and Ralph's understanding shouldnt have been 
possible if he was truly a serial killer (as far as the basic 
rules of the story went). While the actions in themselves 
gave closure to the plot  and tied in nicely with the banal 
messages of the production  the transition of emotion from 
frozen anger to thawed forgiveness, of cold ignorance to 
painful understanding, was not well documented and did not 
allow for full satisfaction within the bounds of the story.
The interpretation of the play, however, was extremely well 
executed and did wonders with what proved to be a difficult 
script  consisting of many intertwined monologues and 
relatively little dialogue  and a difficult story, with cliched 
moral admonitions and difficult characters to portray. The 
production emphasized how each character progressed 
through his or her specific emotional spectrum rather than 
dwelling on the message or story, which allowed for greater 
audience investment.
Central to the scheme of the play was the set. Upstage center 
was a platform (which alternately served as a "lock-up box" 
for Ralphs obsessions and victims, Ralphs jail cell, and later 
as Nancy's grave for Rhona). The rest was sprinkled with 
cragged rock clusters colored in somber grays, symbolic of
the overarching theme of the play  the emoting forces that 
made humans become frozen, stuck, trapped. This nontraditional and almost spartan set design was implemented 
to underscore another important theme of the story  the 
concept of a world in healing. Brushes of light within 
the sets dark colors embodied the characters hopeful 
transformations.
The performances were strong on the parts of all three actors, 
in particular that of Rossell, who played Nancy. She delivered 
each of her lines with exactly the right amount of emotional 
magnitude, and her voice fell and rose in perfect rhythm with 
the language of the script. The most striking part of Rossells 
performance was how genuinely her eyes gleamed when 
she spoke of Rhona, and her stage presence was almost 
unbearable in the tragic aura she exuded as her perspective 
filled the room.
Frozen concludes with the suicide of Ralph, unable to 
deal with his newfound comprehension of the suffering 
he's caused. Nancy attains the desire she's harbored for 
two decades  Ralphs death  despite her forgiveness. 
Agnetha, who started out alone, has made a sort of friend in 
Nancy, and she decides not to tell the wife of her deceased 
partner about her affair. Under May's skilled direction, Frozen 
was given a solid performance that captured the emotional 
journeys of each of its characters.

Campus SuperStar: Fabulous and Simon-less
First-year Nick Cosgrove wins competition based on American Idol
For anyone who would try out for American Idol, if not for 
the days-long lines for auditions, or the prospect of being 
embarrassed by Simon Cowell on national television, your 
excuses are used up. This past Thursday, the Hillel Jewish 
University Center of Pittsburgh hosted its own "Campus 
SuperStar" competition, modeled after the popular television 
show, where local talent competed for a chance to win 
$5000 as well as the title of Campus SuperStar. Hosted by 
Elliot Yamin, who came in third place on last years season 
of American Idol, the show's performances, a mix of pop 
and musical theater tunes, rivaled those of the current Idol 
competition.
The Campus SuperStar competition followed the format of 
American Idol, which involves several stages of auditions 
followed by performances by the finalists  Campus 
SuperStar even included a blue-lit stage with metal 
scaffolding similar to Idol's set in Hollywood. Out of the 107 
students who auditioned in September, 24 semifinalists were 
called back for the second round of auditions on February 
18 at the William Pitt Union. From those, 10 finalists were 
chosen to perform at Carnegie Music Hall, which hosted a 
packed show this past Thursday. Although the winner was . 
ultimately chosen by the audience, four judges critiqued each 
performance. None of the comments were anywhere near 
what you might expect to hear from Simon Cowell. Still, the 
judges (local celebrities Etta Cox, Lynn Cullen, Ken Rice, and 
Richard Rauh) provided honest, useful feedback.
Of the 10 finalists, five were students in the Carnegie Mellon 
School of Drama: sophomore Bernie Balbot,
first-year Nick Cosgrove,
The Beat that My 
Heart Skipped
Wednesday, April 4
Music and crime collide in 
2005's The Beat that My 
Heart Skipped, French director 
Jacques Audiards adaptation 
of Fingers, a 1978 film of cult 
notoriety. In the film, 28-year-old 
Tom (Romaln Duris, The Russian 
Dolls) has been following in his 
fathers footsteps toward a life 
of crime  in particular, one of 
sketchy real estate transactions. 
Tom seems like kind of a lost 
cause until he encounters his 
mothers former music agent, 
whose presence makes Tom 
want to return to the piano, a 
passion of his youth. Now, Tom 
has to choose between his 
mother (a pianist) and his father: 
real estate and piano, music and 
crime.
sophomore Jon-Michael Reese, first-year Tess Soltau, and 
sophomore Sam Trussell. Two other drama students, first-year 
Sophia Feldman and junior Roberta Burke, were selected for 
the final 10 but were unable to attend the competition. The 
other contestants included two undergraduates from the 
University of Pittsburgh, two from Point Park University, and 
one graduate student from Duquesne University.
The winner of the Campus SuperStar title was Carnegie 
Mellon first-year Nick Cosgrove. Singing second, Cosgrove 
performed an impressive rendition of Edwin McCains Ill 
Be." Judge Lynn Cullen played on the tunes lyrics in her 
praise for Cosgrove, saying, "I'll be your greatest fan!"
Second place went to Alyssa Thatcher, a sophomore at the 
University of Pittsburgh, whose sultry, jazzy voice captivated 
the audience and the judges. "[While the other performers] 
knocked our socks off," said judge and local news anchor 
Ken Rice, you gently rolled our socks down. The third-place 
slot went to the night's final performer, Rob Kurth, who is 
currently working on a masters in vocal performance at 
Duquesne University.
Other notable performances included School of Drama 
first-year Tess Soltau's version of Lets Give Em Something 
To Talk About." Soltaus fabulous belt and bubbly personality 
were a hit, especially among the male judges. After her 
performance, judge (and agent) Richard Rauh asked Soltau 
if. he could represent her talent in New York City, while Ken 
Rice confessed, "You had me at Lets." Staying true to Idol, 
Point Parks Kirstie Cook sang Before He Cheats," which 
was originally recorded by country singer Carrie Underwood, 
who also won American Idol. Ultimately, all of the nights 
performers were both entertaining and talented. Maybe it's 
time for Pittsburgh to become one of the stops on American 
Idol's audition tour.

Sophie Scholl  
The Final Days
Thursday, April 5
Set in 1943, Oscar-nominated 
German film Sophie Scholl
 The Final Days tells the true 
story of Sophie Scholl (Julia 
Jentsch), one of the student 
founders of the White Rose, 
an anti-Nazi group at Munich 
University. Caught distributing 
anti-Nazi pamphlets on campus, 
Scholl is subjected to a threeday-long interrogation, lead by 
Gestapo investigator Robert 
Mohr (Gerald Alexander Field). 
Though its title (The Final Days) 
kind of gives away the ending, 
the film still manages to keep 
the tension rising.
Children of Men
Friday, April 6 
81012
2006s Children of Men is a 
bleak glimpse into the future:
In 2027, women are infertile, 
the government is intense, and 
Britain is the only first-world 
nation still standing. Theo (Clive 
Owen) is a disaffected former 
activist, yanked from his day 
job by Julian (Julianne Moore), 
his ex-wife and former partnerin-protest. Rediscovering his 
heroism along the way, Theo 
is in charge of protecting (and 
transporting) the worlds only 
pregnant woman (Claire-Flope 
Ashitey). Even if youve seen 
this movie, see it again. Its 
impossible to appreciate both the 
story and the cinematography in 
a single watch.
Charlottes Web
Saturday, April 7 
8:15 10 11:45
An update on the 1973 animated 
classic, Charlottes Web is a 
live-action version of the story of 
one pigs mission to avoid, well, 
a place at the dinner table. The 
film features a slew of celebrity 
voice-overs: Julia Roberts, Steve 
Buscemi, Oprah Winfrey, Cedric 
the Entertainer... the list goes on. 
On screen, the little girl is played 
by DakotaFanning (as usual), 
who continues to dominate the 
market for 13-year-olds who look 
like theyre 7. Whether youre 
nostalgic for your childhood, a 
vegetarian, or just a fan of Steve 
Buscemi, Charlottes Web might 
make for a relaxing Saturday 
night.

I wish Wheel of Fortune could be

Copyright festival raises artists issues
by Selena Beckman-Harned | Staffwriter
Deren Guler I Assistant Photo Editor
Warhol. Duchamp. Picasso. Ray Charles. The Legendary 
K.O. All these artists  and countless others  were 
copyright criminals. If youve ever grabbed an image 
from Google, made a collage from cut-up magazines, 
or mixed up a wacky political satire for YouTube, then 
youre guilty, too. Copyright law is an issue that brings 
together artists, musicians, programmers, filmmakers, and 
researchers  anyone who creates. This past weekend, 
artists and copyright criminals of all kinds came together at 
Carnegie Mellon to share their work  and their love-hate 
relationship with the laws that strangle them, even while 
providing them their livelihoods. The event, titled You're 
Not the Boss of Me," took place both on and off campus.
Visiting art professor and organizer of the event Chris 
Sperandio explained that he wanted to hold a "copyright 
festival" because, in his words, "I couldn't bear the idea of 
holding a conference. To create a festive atmosphere, the 
event included a performance by Girl Talk at the Warhol, 
an art trade fair, an exhibition of transgressive films, and 
a "spacedelic dance party" at brillobox. There was also a 
keynote lecture by Duke law professor James Boyle and a 
panel discussion featuring three video artists.
Copyright law forces artists into a double bind. They need 
their work to be protected to make a living, but they're 
slapped with a cease and desist" order if they borrow or 
reference anything made after 1923. Referencing can be 
legal if paid for, but the cost is ridiculous. In his graphic 
novel, Bound By Law, Boyle describes how Fox wanted 
filmmaker John Else to pay $10,000 for four-and-a-half 
seconds of an episode of The Simpsons that he accidentally 
caught while filming a documentary about opera  even 
after Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, signed off 
on the clip. The rap group N.W.A. was sued for sampling
three guitar notes, according to Boyle. "The microscope of 
copyright law," Boyle said, has dialed down to the atomic 
level. Once the law could only see the whole song  now it 
sees individual notes." But it hasnt always been this way.
In 1623, composer Salomone Rossi set the stage for modern 
copyright law by including a notice with his compositions 
that set a rabbinical curse on the head of anyone who dared 
copy his music. Early laws protected publishers, not artists, 
but the real birth of modern copyright originated in England 
with the 1710 Statute of Anne, which granted creators 
exclusive rights over their works for 28 years. Todays 
laws are complicated, but basically, original creations are 
protected for 70 years after the artists death. Only in the 
past 30 years has copyright law become specific enough 
to cover seconds of footage or notes of music, a movement 
Boyle described as the metastasis of copyright.
Copyright law does leave some room for interpretation
 provisions for fair use" allow commentary, criticism, 
parody, or satire, in what Boyle described as public roads 
. running through the private plots of copyright." But what 
exactly constitutes fair use? Nobody agrees. Suzie Silver, 
art professor .and the organizer and DJ of the festival's 
closing dance party, described fair use as a mess. Silver 
continued, "Nobody knows what fair use is. Quoting is 
normal in academic texts, but artists cant quote other 
artists or mass culture.
Boyle traced the history of one controversial song, "George 
Bush Doesnt Like Black People by the Legendary K.O.
The song, a reaction to the government's incompetence 
during Hurricane Katrina, was based on a comment made 
by Kanye West at a fundraiser. In George Bush, the 
Legendary K.O. sampled West's song "Golddigger, and
the group was sued within four days of releasing the song 
for copyright infringement, though not before spawning 
several music videos on YouTube featuring footage from 
Katrina. Turns out, however, that West himself borrowed 
from Ray Charless I Got A Woman in his song  and 
Charles, in his turn, borrowed the tune of an old hymn, "I 
Got A Savior. Even assuming that the composer of that 
hymn, Clara Ward, got her music directly from God, that 
one song encompasses nearly a hundred years of musical 
history. It also illustrates how natural the act of borrowing" *' 
is, not just in music but across all artistic genres.
Art is meaningless without context  as Boyle said, If 
you want to make sense to somebody, you have to hook 
onto something they already know. Where would Warhol 
be without Campbells soup cans or Harry Potter without 
British boarding schools?
The video artists on Saturdays discussion panel 
underscored the importance of using real material. Jacob 
Ciocci, an artist whose work draws upon references to 
popular culture, showed a piece he worked on called "Super 
Mario Movie, which uses a hacked Super Mario cartridge 
to tell the story of Marios existential crisis when he realizes 
hes been abandoned in a closet for 20 years. Sure, Ciocci 
explained, he could have pulled off the same effect in a few 
hours with a Flash animation, but it wouldnt have tapped 
into the thrill of the secret world inside the code, a world 
that most gamers only discover when a game crashes, 
revealing the abstract skeleton of code beneath. To ensure 
the impact of this work, Ciocci displayed the hacked Mario 
cartridge along with the video.
Brody Condon, another artist on the panel, explained the 
hacker's credo  "You have to make sure everyone knows

Everyone must read the Word of Cohon
Students follow Beliefs of the Plaid, shun outsiders by putting up wall
Security increased at 
UCLA, Tasers ordered
Police chief requests funding for under
ground torture chamber, pool party
by Patrick Gage Kelley
Lover of the Plaid
President Jared Cohon 
held a conference today an
nouncing the third and final 
stage of his plan for Carnegie 
Mellon Unification.
You may not remember 
the first stage, as it was long 
ago, but initially, plaid bicy
cles and sports equipment in 
large containers were placed 
around campus under the 
guise of a Public Recreation 
Program.
The success of these offer
ings, equipment so plaid that 
no one felt compelled to steal 
it, led to further research in 
the way the Carnegie Tartan 
affected the human psyche.
It was these first steps that 
paved the way for early re
search that proved that Plaid 
moved people to lead happier, 
more communal lives  leav
ing behind greed, jealousy, 
and theft. As the community 
bonded together in ever
growing harmony, students 
pushed for an increase in all 
things Plaid.
Those were the days when 
the plaid astroturf that graces 
the Cut today was installed; 
the increase in free transpor
tation devices meant commu
nity-owned plaid scooters, 
Vespas, and Segways; and 
the Student Senate unani
mously decided to require all 
students, staff, faculty, and 
administrators to wear plaid 
uniforms, distributed at no 
charge.
After Master Cohon de
clared the community a safe 
zone, he began the erection of
the recently finished barrier 
wall, gating in all of campus, 
the surrounding neighbor
hood to the north, and part 
of Schenley Park, as well as 
the Carnegie museums. And 
so was completed the segre
gation of the outside world 
from our great people. Now 
the Gate of Heavenly Plaid 
has become the only means 
of passage to the outside and 
monitors all who cross be
neath it.
As a uniform people, we 
began to cleanse our society 
of the evils that plagued even 
us. The Plaidstitutes, whores 
who scarred our purity, were 
expelled along with the 
nerdiest and the unclean.
All children are now edu
cated based on the Little 
Plaid Book, which they re
ceive when they reach age
five and are able to recite long 
before their Kiltmitzvah, the 
celebration of thirteen years 
among the Plaid.
Our Eternal Leader Cohon 
has helped us to correct the 
errors in the old history books 
that cite times before the An
drews  may their souls be 
draped in Plaid  which is, 
of course, the greatest fallacy 
of all. The Andrews, who 
together created the first 
systems of writing, built the 
first castles, printed the first 
money (improperly used by 
the capitalist economies of 
the past), and together de
signed the Plaid  a fabric 
superior to all others in the 
known universe.
And each day, The GodChild His-Supremacy Jared

Taser enthusiast
After a controversial inci
dent last November wherein 
a UCLA student was shot 
several times with a Taser 
by university police, admin
istrators have taken drastic 
measures to ensure nothing 
similar ever happens again at 
UCLA.
UCLA police chief Karl T. 
Ross recently held a press 
conference to outline his new 
plan.
The fact of the matter is 
that what happened is sim
ply unacceptable, Ross said 
at the conference. Honestly, 
Im ashamed and embar
rassed. UCLA police officers 
are taught to show wisdom 
and restraint, and in this case 
they clearly didnt. I pledge to 
all of you now: Never again 
will a public safety officer use 
unnecessary force in front of 
other students  especially 
those with video phones!
Ross detailed his plan to 
establish an underground gu
lag system on campus, where, 
according to him, all physi
cal abuse will take place, 
including but not limited to 
tasering, slapping, punching, 
kicking, pepper-spraying, 
and a little game I call Justice 
Piata. Its just like that old 
birthday favorite, except we 
use night-sticks, and we dont 
eat the candy.
Many students are out
raged by this new plan.
Are you kidding me? Are 
you [expletive] kidding me? 
said Thomas Clarion, a ju
nior political science major at 
UCLA.'Does Amnesty Inter
national know about this?
Indeed, the campus chap
ter of Amnesty International 
staged a protest of the chiefs 
plan in a display unparalleled 
in UCLA history since the 
Vietnam War.
Chief Ross was unavail
able for comment after his 
-press conference, but one of 
the officers involved in the 
November incident gave an 
exclusive interview. The of
ficer, who legally changed 
his name to Lectric McTaserhappy after joining the UCLA 
police, was eager to voice his 
support for Rosss plan.
At first I was scared he 
would take my Taser away, 
McTaserhappy said. With 
these new bunkers, we can 
tase and tase the day away! 
McTaserhappy then ex
plained how hed always been 
fascinated by electricity ever 
since, as a boy, he licked ninevolt batteries for fun.
I think the Taser is getting 
a bad reputation, he said at 
his home near UCLAs cam
pus. But its an incredible, 
non-lethal tool. Non-lethal

2This is like a 20th generation Hapsburg * APRIL 1, 2007
University Police found an unidentified adult male hanging from Walking to the Sky in 
the early morning hours of last Thursday. The man was taken to the hospital where he is 
still in critical condition. Police officials can only speculate as to how the man reached the 
top of the pole only to fall and dangle for an undetermined amount of time. Of even more 
importance to investigators is the mans motive; Police have not ruled out foul play.
White House runs out of toilet 
paper, uses Constitution
by Selena Beckman-Harned
Stickiri it to the Man since 1984
Due to an emergency al
location of funds to support 
the troop surge, the White 
House janitorial staff has run 
out of toilet paper and lacks 
sufficient funds to buy more, 
interim presidential spokes
woman Dana Perino revealed 
at a press conference Friday.
The situation might have 
led to a different type of 
surge, located in the presi
dential tighty whiteys, had 
the Commander in Chief 
himself not thought of a solu
tion. I was walkin through 
that big buildin with all the 
columns, the President ex
plained in his weekly radio 
address, when I caught sight 
of the Constitution, and I 
thought, hell, were not using
that thing, anyway! Heh heh 
heh.
Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice had also 
suggested using drafts of the 
Senates recent abortive non
binding resolution against 
the war in Iraq, which is cur
rently stuffed in the recy
cling bins A1 Gore made Con
gress buy. But the President 
objected. That resowhatsit 
is printed on regular com
puter paper. Have you ever 
tried wiping your ass with 
computer paper? Its rougher 
than Lauras legs in the morn
ing. Now the Constitution
 thats nice and soft. Like 
a babys butt. Made of that
 whatchacallit  that old 
stuff before they had paper. 
Papyrus or somethin. Now 
thats a nice wipe.
The White House does 
not consider all portions of
the Constitution suitable as 
toilet paper, however. I like 
that second amendment, the 
President mused. I had that 
one cut out and mounted on 
the wall of the Oval Office. 
Heh. Heh. The President 
also spent some time with a 
pair of scissors cutting out 
words he liked and making 
a collage which read The 
President shall be perfect 
blessings of liberty and shall 
have all power cruel and un
usual, plus some glitter and 
a few happy-face stickers.
The rest of the document, 
however, was ripped into 
thin strips and carefully 
rolled around toilet-paper 
rolls by White House interns. 
This job totally sucks, said 
intern Karen Williams as she 
crouched in a West Wing stall,

history as a new beginning. 
His words:
Today My Children, we 
will secure our place on this 
planet. On this coming Mon
day the first Mass-Marriage of 
Skibonians will be held on the 
Plaid Cut. Over 3000 of our 
own Children will be wed to

the first new Generation, the 
Alphas, those completely 
sheltered from the Non-Plaid

Gate of Heavenly Plaid For
ever, until we can slowly and 
steadily expand our realm. 
With our Scientific Research 
Powers and our Superior

we alone have created a Per

Co-ed Major Pilot slated for SCS
Can women program? Sjogren, Hamilton say 'yes
by Sarah Mogin
Burn Book Editor
In the School of Computer 
Science, faculty and admin
istrators alike are already 
making plans for the coming 
semester, which will mark 
the inauguration of Carn
egie Mellons Co-ed Major 
Pilot, one of several progres
sive initiatives put forth by 
Student Body President Karl 
Sjogren and Vice President 
Andrea Hamilton.
Were only tackling one
major at a time, Hamilton 
said. We chose to start with 
computer science because 
theres been success at other 
schools with similar pro
grams.
Last year, the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology 
opened the doors of its CS 
department to co-ed majors. 
According to an article in The 
Boston Globe, the results were 
overwhelmingly positive: 
Classrooms became neater, 
profits from department bake 
sales rose over 25 percent, 
and more students changed
their wallpapers to pictures 
of cute, fuzzy animals.
Despite this alleged suc
cess, some students remain 
unconvinced. Girls have 
been taking CS classes here 
for years, said Marshall 
Brown, a sophomore at MIT. 
The thing is, nobody could 
tell that they were girls.
At Carnegie Mellon, 
too, not all sentiments are 
positive. The SCS at CMU 
doesnt need any XX mixing 
with its XY, said Martin A. 
Nelson, a senior in the CS 
department. This is only the
beginning, MAN continued. 
Whats next? MCS? CIT? 
ECEs will go MIAI can tell 
you that.
Still, some Carnegie Mel
lon students are excited to 
hear about the pilot. Its im
portant to promote the equal
ity of men and women, said 
junior Chelsea Craft, a dou
ble major in gender studies 
and home economics.

Phallocentric
Erectile dysfunction is no 
joke; seriously, stop laughing. 
Unless you hail from Ala
bama, Mom really shouldnt 
be helping you with this one. 
Interestingly, the university 
has covertly made it a key is
sue for the coming academic 
year.
University leadership an
nounced last week that it 
had an ulterior motive for in
stalling the strangely phallic 
Walking to the Sky. Weve 
all heard it before: Sex kills. 
Come to CMU and live for
ever. Well, weve decided to 
change that, said Joel Rudy, 
director of alumni relations.
Using a Counseling and 
Psychological Services sur
vey, officials discovered that 
a principal reason for the lack 
of sex among students was 
the occurrence of erectile 
dysfunction. ED has many 
causes, from rejection (Mike, 
please call me) to depres
sion. We realized that many 
of the problems people were 
struggling with were rooted 
in sexual encounters gone 
hysterically wrong, said a 
CAPS spokesperson.
In a blatant violation of 
privacy, the administration 
has posted taped counsel
ing sessions on YouTube. 
The stories are pretty funny 
and hey, its still safer than 
shopping at TJ Maxx, commented university general 
counsel Gerry Hatrik. Stu
dent Senate promptly called 
for an investigation and has 
demanded testimony from 
administration advisors.
Despite this lapse in 
information security, Cylab 
officials would not comment, 
but prattled on about their 
paladin with 18 charisma and 
97 hit points, who can use the 
Helm of Disintegration and 
do one D-4 damage.
The administration re
mains undeterred. Employee 
morale in my office has shot 
up, beamed president Jared 
Cohon. My secretary, Carmencita, and I have dispensed 
with the cock ring.
Reacting to university 
statements, Student Body 
President Karl Sjogren called 
a press conference citing 
university duplicity: This 
giant pole reflects badly on 
the administration. Pinocchio doesnt look like such a 
bad liar anymore. Sjogren 
then announced that he too 
has thrown his hat into the 
contest for the Democratic 
presidential nomination.
A fraternity brother who 
wished to remain anonymous 
remarked, Dude, this sucks. I 
dont want to go to class every 
day and see this on the, way. 
No one on the quad deals with 
this crap. Oh man, ha ha, what 
they should have done was

Radcliffe shows skills, scrotum in new film; Tijuana economy booms
by Selena Beckman-Harned
Stickin it to the Man since 1984
Fans of Harry Potters 
nubile young bod, rejoice
 Daniel Radcliffe, the ac
tor who portrays Harry in 
the movies, revealed on Ac
cess Hollywood yesterday 
that he will be showing his 
oh-so-pinchable butt cheeks 
in the new movie Accio Ass
by Mexican filmmaker Tito 
Mojito. And, girls  hes 
leeeeeeeeeegal!
Radcliffe has been quite the 
little exhibitionist lately  
first baring his silky smooth 
chest while deciphering a 
screeching eggs message in 
The Goblet of Fire, then bar
ing it all, from his sun-kissed 
chestnut locks to his sweet, 
sweet scrotum, as the crazy 
horse-blinder in Equus.
But thats nothing
compared to what salivating 
moviegoers will be treated to 
in Accio Ass.
The movie, Radcliffe
explained in an exclusive 
interview, stars himself as a 
lonely magician living on the 
streets of Tijuana with only a 
donkey to talk to.
The nudity is not gra
tuitous, mate, Radcliffe
insisted, sweat glistening
on his chiseled abs. I play 
a poor wizard who cant af
ford clothes. And the sex isnt 
gratuitous either, he added, 
stretching his arms behind 
his head and sending a glori
ous rippling of muscle down 
his torso. Its a buddy movie
 okay, a really close buddy 
movie. Hey... stop touching 
that.
What are you writing? 
Radcliffe asked suspiciously,
leaning over the table and 
exposing his firm, sinuous 
curves. Reporters always 
focus on the nudity. Its not 
about the bloody nudity. Its 
not! His left butt cheek pul
sated with fury.
This role is really helping 
me grow as an actor. I con
ducted extensive research 
into the drug and sex trades 
of Tijuana to better under
stand my characters -past.
Radcliffe slammed his fist 
down on the table, muscled 
biceps bulging. I even did 
some method acting last week 
to find out how to accurately 
portray a threesome between 
me, a donkey, and a Swedish 
prostitute. I have never been 
more serious about my craft! 
Radcliffe was the natural 
choice, director Mojito said,

turned to watching Wheel of

A spokesperson for Carn
egie Mellon was conciliatory. 
We want to combat Brewers 
droop on the fraternity quad, 
but dont wish to disrupt the 
valuable relaxing service a 
fraternity party can provide. 
We want that quad full on 
Friday and Saturday nights, 
and in our opinion the pole 
would have no negative ef
fects.
The restatement of the pur
pose of the pole has caused 
some confusion on campus. 
An art student wasnt sure if 
he was supposed to sculpt the 
penis in one of his classes.
Where it is, I immediately 
feel that it defines us in the 
wrong way, said Jordan Ruiz, 
a Heinz School professor and 
chair of the Faculty Affairs
Council. If university offi
cials had taken a better look 
at the statistics, they would 
have noticed that stress and 
exhaustion were the princi
pal causes of botched sex.
I know these people, Ruiz 
continued, They drive fancy 
sports cars to compensate for 
lacking certain qualities. The 
pole stands as a testament to 
the personal inadequacies of 
senior university officials. I 
mean, its just like the people 
who wear name-brand cloth
ing. They may have built a 
long wall, but Bob Dole would 
make sure they stayed on 
their side of it.
The focus on ED comes sev
eral years after the release 
of impotency pills, but the 
belated push for awareness 
at CMU has not been any less 
impressive. It has prompted 
student groups tabling in 
front of Doherty to give out 
salads with blue croutons. A 
new play put on by the drama 
school, The Lazarus Effect, 
addresses the social implica
tions of ED.
[ED] can also be an issue 
of timing. Why do they make 
the condom packets so hard 
to open? asked a meek Larry 
Ross, who is studying marine 
biology. I mean, I can never 
get the package open in time. 
Its like Beat the Clock."

by Justin Brown
Holden Grudges
Just last week, the manag
ers of Lunar Gala (LG) put 
together what they are calling 
the best new club at Carn
egie Mellon. Their new seed 
organization  tentatively 
named Modelsty!  will 
attempt to ward off the cloud 
of arrogance that so heavily 
hangs over our school.
People always think 
theyre the shit, said Nancy 
Huang, president of both Lu
nar Gala and the new clubWere here to tell them thats 
not the case. Huang believes 
that by showing the rest of the 
campus how cool and pretty 
she and her underlings are, 
students will recognize their 
subordinate status and stop 
imposing egotistical faades 
on their peers.
Modelsty! plans to hold
extravagant parties weekly, 
with live musical and per
sonal entertainment, and 
lots of free alcohol. Only the 
leaders of the group will be 
invited, Huang explained. 
Its only after weve lost ev
erything that were free to do 
anything, and people need to 
experience not being invited 
to a party. Like in third grade 
when that bitch Veronica 
didnt invite me to her birth
day party and then grinded 
on the boy I liked there. Well, 
I heard now shes not even in 
the fashion show at Vassar 
 so take that, slut! And my 
boyfriend bought me a car. 
The group ran into funding 
issues at the beginning. Tessa 
Janson, LGs treasurer, said 
that they applied for funding 
from both Student Senate and 
the Graduate Student Assem
bly. GSA called our request 
completely unnecessary 
and said that it was of no in
terest to graduate students, 
Janson said, but theyre 
just jfealous. JFC, Student 
Senates funding commit
tee, saved Modelsty! from 
certain death. In total, Mod
elsty! was awarded a budget 
of $50,000 by JFC, after ask
ing for $67,000. We cut their 
$17,000 request for student 
security because it was the 
most expensive item  LOL! 
stated the JFC collectively in 
an e-mail interview.
Brad Charleston,
Modeslty!s PR manager, 
has an innovative approach 
to attracting new members. 
Charleston believes that be
cause he is rich and popular 
and good-looking and [has] 
no body hair, people will 
literally throw themselves 
at the sign-up table. Itll be 
really funny too, Charles

Mojito, born and raised in

Mojito also revealed that 
Emma Watson and Rupert

Hermione Granger and Ron

movies, have cameo roles in 
Accio Ass as a pizza-delivering duo.
Some parents have ex

children might see photos of

this issue. Bloody hell, he

his wand. Just give the kids

we say it is.
Now, weve been noticing 
recently that certain groups 
have had the audacity to dis
agree with us. Shame on you!
A while ago we made 
claims that readme caused 
9/11 or something. I dont 
know, I dont really read what 
we write  but it was to that 
effect.
Anyway, a lot of people, 
some not even affiliated with 
readme, wrote in to us com
plaining that no, in fact re
adme did not wipe out most 
of the Native Americans with 
smallpox. Id just like to say 
that every one of you that 
wrote in disagreeing with us, 
you are all stupidheads. And 
you cant touch me because 
Im hiding behind the veil 
of The Board, which is all
knowing and all-powerful.

See the thing is, we are 
better than everyone else 
because weve been around 
since 1906. During those 
years we have brought noth
ing but the best to the Carn
egie Mellon campus without 
missing a beat. Because of 
our unwavering perfection, 
people should know by now 
not to question anything we 
write unless its in that Pillbox 
section.
A couple of weeks after the 
readme incident, we wrote 
an article about CAPS stating 
that there was a three-weeklong waiting list for students 
to receive attention, and that 
CAPS should be firebombed 
accordingly.
We received a lot of criti
cism from those propaganda 
artists over there at Psycho
logical Services. For some 
reason they thought what 
we said was untrue, maybe 
even completely made up. 
Please! We here at The Tar
tan keep a close eye on that 
wait list. I mean... none of us 
actually experienced what 
we wrote about, and shyeah,
like were going to call to con
firm what we think. That is so 
below us. And whats more, 
they wanted us to print a cor
rection! We cant change the 
news, CAPS, because were 
not Orwellian like you.
Well, weve just received an 
update on both of these orga
nizations that is sure to shock 
the campus community and 
(please GOD!) increase our 
readership:
It seems Counseling and 
Psychological Services, along 
with its partner in studentkilling crime, readme, is 
actually behind the recent 
capture of British sailors near 
Iran. Our anonymous source 
tells us: CAPS and readme 
are trying to incite another 
world war,- and theyre trying 
to pass the blame onto Iran. 
It is unknown whether Mahmoud Ahmadinejad writes for 
readme or is simply insane. 
Haha okay, Im just BSing 
you, we dont do sources. - 
I guess the point of all this 
is that Im trying to sound 
smart and controversial, and 
also readme should have its 
funding cut because they 
make fun of us. That is so 
morally reprehensible.

Still, burlap has made 
its way onto fashion show

featured burlap as a mate

though. Burlap is known 
to have some extreme side 
effects  including mak
ing Carnegie Mellon look

lap gave me the plague, 
said third-year architecture 
major Lindsey Darwish. For 
those of you who have never 
taken a history class ever 
in your life, the plague was 
quite popular in the 14th 
century, though it killed a 
few people. Back then, not 
having the plague meant you
were an outcast.
Its now the 21st century 
and things are a little differ

Caitlin Olivo, made a confes
sion of her own: Lindseys

common where potatoes are

Side effects of under

there. A victim who wished to

another admits to what doc

students really willing to 
sacrifice their lives to find 
a replacement for Tartans

Applebaum says yes. 
Burlap is not for the weak 
of heart, or the weak of 
academics.
Many students, like the 
ones mentioned above, have 
already courageously tried 
out burlap, but Applebaum 
wants more students to rec

a glorious thing, she says.
The diseases that people are 
contracting arent a big deal. 
When I first started wearing 
burlap  and I wear it every

its nothing. She continues,

even creating an official

Last Friday, President 
Jared Cohon announced that 
he had raised $150,000 in 
his effort to buy one of the 
seats on Virgin Galactics first 
shuttle to outer space. Cohon 
began his fundraising efforts 
several months ago when he 
first learned of the opportu
nity. I was watching CNN 
and Richard Branson was on. 
Hes really super. Anyway, 
Anderson Cooper was all like 
You can go to space. So, I 
called my secretary and had 
her cancel all my meetings. 
Six minutes of weightlessness 
for only $200,000? Count me 
in, Cohon said from inside 
the cardboard spaceship in 
his backyard.
Cohon used proceeds from 
a month-long bake sale to 
build his cardboard ship. 
The cardboard structures 
purpose remains unclear. 
However, Cohon believes it 
will facilitate his space train
ing. In addition, Cohon has 
hired retired astronauts to 
supervise the daily backyard 
training sessions, though he 
had to let the diapered one 
go after she made an attempt 
on his life. The astronauts 
salaries are paid for entirely 
with pledges from Cohons
Presidents Day telethon. 
Cohon appeared on CBS af
filiate KDKA in February nd 
answered phones through
out the day. When the lines 
closed, viewers had donated 
over $70,000.
Its a really positive proj
ect for him. Hes happy and 
looks absolutely adorable in 
that spacesuit, said an ad
ministrative official in the 
presidents office who wished 
to remain anonymous. Cohon 
had the suit custom-made by 
a company in Russia. He sold 
over 3700 boxes of Girl Scout 
Cookies to cover the cost of 
the suit, including shipping. 
I ate a lot of Thin Mints that 
month. Delicious! Cohon 
said from underneath his 
helmet visor.
Cohons autobiography re
veals that space travel had 
been a childhood ambition 
of his and remained so into 
adulthood. I never had any
thing really cool to bring in 
for show-and-tell. This is the 
ultimate show-and-tell story. 
Im gonna wear my spacesuit 
to the next Collegiate Presi
dents Symposium. [Stanford 
University President] Hennessy is gonna be so jeal

face, Cohon said between

Cohon already has his next 
project lined up. Im gonna 
catch Nessie. When asked 
how he was going to pay for 
the endeavor, Cohon said 
that he had a piggy bank 
full of quarters but also 
had plans for a lemonade 
stand at the corner of Forbes 
and Morewood avenues. He 
added, College students 
love lemonade.
Last spring, Cohon com
missioned a tunnel to China.
The hole, located outside of 
Warner Hall, had reached a 
depth of 10 feet by Cohons 4 
p.m. cookie break. Unfortu
nately, mid-bite, Cohon saw a 
pretty butterfly and followed 
it into Schenley Park, where 
he wandered the bicycle path 
for three days before emerg
ing unharmed on the golf 
course. By the time Cohon 
had returned to campus, the 
Board of Trustees had filled 
in the hole.
But Cohons dream to go to 
space isnt a reality  yet. I 
still have $50,000 to raise be
fore I get a seat, Cohon said 
in between bites of freezedried Neapolitan ice cream, 
This is the same ice cream 
astronauts eat.
Next week, Cohon plans to 
have a car wash to raise the re

trip. If it rains, Im going to

Cohon said. I hope some

duties. Jason Berovlogen, 
a junior in CS, voiced his 
worry, saying, Whos go

to increase 50 percent for the

about spreading himself too

For some reason, the Na

Are you out of your minds?

holds dear? Or what? 
Weinstein isnt the only 
one with his panties in a

the NSA commented on the 
situation anonymously from 
an undisclosed location,

Such enthusiasm has been 
echoed throughout the aca

fantastic, wonderful idea to 
encourage women to study 
science, said Larry Summers, 
former president of Harvard 
University, at a press confer

Carnegie Mellon the best of 
luck.
Sources have confirmed that 
Summers was not  as some 
have speculated  cross
ing his fingers at any point 
throughout the press confer
ence. However, according to 
an article in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, reporters closest 
to Summers were able to hear 
him mutter not at the end of 
every sentence.
Despite such wavering sup
port, Sjogren and Hamilton 
are optimistic about the pilot 
programs success. According 
to Sjogren, administrators at 
Carnegie Mellon have worked 
out a deal with Duquesne Uni
versity, which has offered 
guaranteed admission for all 
female students participating 
in [and inevitably dropping 
out of] the pilot.
Its sort of a try/catch 
method of policy making, 
said Sjogren. If the students 
are unhappy, we see the error
and we fix the bug. 
Meanwhile, administrators 
at SCS are working on figur
ing out the programs logis
tics. Weve spent a lot of time 
discussing possible changes in 
the curriculum, said Byron 
Doolittle, assistant to the dean 
of the School of Computer Sci
ence. Weve already added 
one new course.
Welcome to Computer 
Science, 15-069, will be 
available for SCS students 
starting Fall 2007. The course 
covers elementary technologi
cal concepts, including how to 
program a microwave, order 
groceries online, and preheat 
an oven with a digital display. 
Students will also learn how 
to maneuver a coin-operated 
washer/dryer, similar to those 
available in many of Housings 
off-campus facilities.
Like most computer science 
courses, 15-069 will involve 
rigorous weekly program
ming assignments. Students 
will have the option of submit
ting their work through the 
electronic hand-in system, 
Doolittle explained. Alter
natively, they can embroider 
it on a pillowcase, napkin, or 
similar medium.
Grading for 15-069 will 
encompass class participa
tion, programs, problem sets, 
a midterm, and a.final exam. 
Under the tentative syllabus, 
the midterm will be an oral 
examination, Doolittle said. 
The final, on the other hand, 
is slated to be a take-home as
signment due on the last day 
of class. The result should 
be something like a potluck, 
said Doolittle.

you hacked it." If Condons piece Adam Killer, which 
follows Condons video game character as he blows away 
scores of unarmed and unfazed replicas of his friend Adam, 
were not based on the game Half-Life, it would lose most of 
its meaning.
Despite its flaws, artists need copyright protection. 
Although some artists, like Silver, dont care about 
protecting their work, preferring that it reach as many 
people as possible, many artists cant make a living without 
copyrights. "Copyright is an extremely outdated way of 
looking at media, Ciocci said, but its a livelihood." Artists 
like Ciocci and Condon make money by releasing a small 
number of limited-edition DVDs to collectors and keeping 
the original files to give to friends. Since their original 
work depends on appropriated images, video, or code, this 
could be interpreted as a double standard, but, as Ciocci 
explained, musicians who make money by covering older 
songs are essentially doing the same thing.
Copyright also protects artists from malicious spoofs. Ciocci 
described his experience with this; someone had put out 
a fake sequel to one of his books of comics in the form of a 
distorted version of his work. The people behind the parody 
created a My Space profile, too, and many of their 2000 
friends were unaware of the deception.
We might love appropriating, Boyle said, but imagine a 
Nazi editing your work to send his own message."
The future of copyright law is uncertain, but Condon 
noted that designing user-controlled environments where 
modification is not only encouraged but necessary  like 
the Sims or Wikipedia  is becoming more and more 
popular. But while sites like YouTube seem to encourage
appropriation, according to Boyle, all they do is is allow for 
videos packed with stolen images to be streamed until the 
Google gods remove them, and the audience is extremely 
limited. The people [who] the Legendary K.O.s song was 
about never saw the videos, Boyle pointed out.
There's hope for frustrated artists  groups like the 
international non-profit Creative Commons are working to 
spread awareness of copyright issues and convince artists 
to choose "some rights reserved rather than all rights 
reserved" to allow for interpretations by others. And just this 
week, Britains Court of Appeal ruled that since themes and 
ideas are not fair game for copyright, Dan Brown did not 
break the law by borrowing themes from a 1982 non-fiction 
book  another struggling artist" has been spared from 
litigation.
The copyright quandary has no easy answer. Youre Not 
the Boss of Me" was about raising awareness, not providing 
answers. Festival organizers stressed that copyright needs 
to protect artists rather than corporations  and to protect 
without smothering. Without flexibility, copyright laws could 
destroy everything from the brilliant satire of Jon Stewart to 
the work of innovators like Ray Charles. And, as Boyle said, 
Anything that makes Ray Charles illegal is bad."
Above: Girl Talk played at the Warhol Museum 
last Friday night as part of the copyright 
festival. Girl Talk samples and mixes other 
artists' songs to create unique, danceable 
tunes.

Aftertaste
The Mediterranean Grill
Sometimes, the perfect antidote to the meal 
plan can be discovering a great restaurant with 
delicious, exotic food at good prices, both of 
which can be found at the Mediterranean Grill.
The Mediterranean Grill, located on Forbes 
Avenue in Squirrel Hill, is a small restaurant 
that serves authentic Middle Eastern and 
Mediterranean food. Its a little hard to find 
due to its. small facade (the restaurant itself is 
underground), but certainly worth the trouble.
The Mediterranean Grill offers a variety of 
reasonably priced entrees, appetizers, and 
a few desserts. There is great variety in both 
flavor and price. Appetizers range from simple 
dishes like hummus to stuffed grape leaves 
(hot and cold), available with or without meat. 
Entrees vary as well, including gyros (under 
$5), in addition to some more upscale options, 
such as filet mignon. All meals are served with 
heated pita bread, which is brought out before 
the main course.
At the Grill, the atmosphere is very relaxed and 
the dress is casual (jeans and a nice shirt will be 
fine). The restaurant is small and has a limited 
number of tables, and it is not unusual to find a 
line to get in. The food may also require a wait, 
though the servers are friendly and check on 
their tables often. Because of the small space, 
the tables inside are a little crowded. Still, this 
tightness helps create an intimate setting.
The Mediterranean Grill is a BYOB restaurant, 
so there is no bar or alcohol available on the 
menu; you can, however, bring your own (as 
long as youre of age, of course). If alcohol isnt 
your thing, the Grill makes a great mint iced tea 
to order with your food.
If youre with other people, your entrees may 
not arrive at the same time. They wont be too 
far apart, but a one- to two-minute gap is not 
unusual. The food, however, is well worth the 
wait. Regardless of the type of food you choose, 
you are sure to be pleased by the selection. 
Some great dishes include the stuffed grape 
leaves, gyros, shish tawook (tawook means 
chicken), and the tawook salad. Mediterranean 
Grill salads all come tossed with the house 
dressing, so if youd like a plain salad youll 
have to ask in advance.
Next time youre up for an off-campus 
meal, head over to Squirrel Hill and give the 
Mediterranean Grill a try.
The Mediterranean Grill is open Monday through 
Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. It is located 
at 5824 Forbes Avenue, and can be reached at 
412.521.5505. Reservations are not required. 
The Grill accepts credit cards, but there is a $10 
minimum for all credit card transactions.

Cupcaking: What, where, and how much
Two writers weigh in on four local options for sweet, creamy goodness
Cupcakes arent just for elementary-schoolers anymore. Bakeries 
specializing in gourmet cupcakes are springing up in cities all 
over the country. Though the trend probably started with New 
York Citys Magnolia Bakery (of Sex and the City fame), cupcake 
mania has officially landed in Pittsburgh. Our cupcake guide can 
point you to the most delicious cupcakes in the city.
Dozen Cupcakes, Pittsburgh, Murray Avenue, Squirrel 
Hill
Kelly: When I first stumbled upon Dozen, I could not have 
been more overjoyed. Despite the cupcakery's tiny storefront, 
its bright blue interior caught my eye, and I'd go so far as to 
say that it has changed my life. Inside, I discovered what may 
be the single greatest cupcake innovation of all time: the Elvis. 
With banana cake, chocolate hazelnut buttercream filling, and 
peanut butter icing to top it off, the Elvis is like the dessert 
combo Ive always been searching for. Dozen's cake is moist and 
their frosting is filling. Im also a fan of the milk chocolate and 
chocolate peanut butter cupcakes, though the Elvis reigns as 
king.
Kristen: Dozen is a gift from God as far as I'm concerned  a 
throwback to some of my favorite childhood 
birthday cakes with a dry cake and stiff 
buttercream frosting. I often choose 
the vanilla-vanilla (vanilla icing on 
top of vanilla cake) in an effort to 
preserve the sanctity of the basic 
cupcake, but have not been upset 
with the meltaways (a cupcake with 
flavored buttercream frosting turned 
upside down and covered in chocolate 
ganache), root beer floats, or passion 
fruit cupcakes. The $2.50 pricetag is a 
small price to pay for a 20-minute edible 
undertaking that can fill you up for most of the afternoon.
**
CoCos Cupcake Caf, Ellsworth Avenue, Shadyside
Kelly: CoCos cupcakes are very gourmet. The vegan green tea 
cupcake, which comes with ginger frosting topped with ginger 
candies, was certainly an interesting taste combination, though 
the flavors didnt really seem like dessert. Another option, 
the lavender cupcake with pink frosting, struck me as a little 
high-brow for a cupcake ' still, it was more 
traditionally sweet and definitely enjoyable.
CoCo's also has a large and attractive sitting 
area to suit all your cupcake dining needs.
Kristen: I have simple tastes, so CoCo's 
cupcakes were a bit intimidating. The 
environment is friendly, though perhaps 
less accessible than Dozen, and the 
more gourmet options (with very pretty 
packaging) are more complicated than your 
typical cupcake flavors. The cake was moist 
and the frosting was buttercream, but did 
not stiffen to a slight crunch quite the way I 
like it. If you're one for a bit more bold, risqu 
flavor and sophistication, CoCo's is a $2.50 
well spent.
Prantls Bakery, Walnut Street, Shadyside
Kelly: Prantls offers three or four different varieties of cupcakes 
along with an impressive assortment of pastries and cakes.
I sampled the lemon-filled cupcake (75 cents), the highlight 
of which was the light lemon compote filling. This cupcake 
featured yellow cake and was topped with a healthy dose of 
confectioners sugar. A cupcake from Prantls is relatively light 
fare compared to the heavy icing of Dozens and CoCo's, and at 
only 75 cents a pop, it was certainly a bargain.
Kristen: Oh Prantls, where do I begin? Light cake thats a 
pretty good balance between dry and "moist," and fluffy, yet 
still stiff, with buttercream icing that 
makes for a delicious and un-intimidating 
cupcake. It's far less of an undertaking 
than Dozen's or CoCos, and may 
leave you wanting more  which is 
fine, since all Prantl's cupcakes are 
priced at less than a dollar.
Giant Eagle, Murray Avenue, 
Squirrel Hill
Kelly: Cupcakes may not be Giant 
Eagles specialty, but the selection 
is certainly tasty. The cupcakes are 
available in chocolate and yellow cake, with yellow frosting 
topped with sprinkles. Ready-to-buy cupcakes are sold by the 
half-dozen, and are a steal at only $3.29 for six cupcakes. The 
lightness of the cake and frosting makes Geagle cupcakes much 
more snackable. You can easily eat more than one at a time.
Kristen: Another option perfect for the budget cupcaker, 
Geagle's cupcakes are addicting. With easy-to-consume, 
commercial-quality cake and icing (a perfect bourgeois combo 
no stomach can deny), it will be hard to avoid finishing the 
half-dozen sitting in front of you  which may in fact be the 
cupcakes very downfall. Theyre so snackable, you might not be 
able to stop.

as the Major in Minors
I take life as its given to 
me, personally.
Life happens;
I happen to like 
that way*

Despite all the name-calling and seeming lack of support, your 
mentor will surprise you with some praise this week. Enjoy it, because 
moments like these are few and far between.
Avoid jamming sliding doors with paper clips. It will only lead to 
trouble.
Now would not be a good time to jump through a ring of fire on 
your Vespa.
This weeks forecast: Hopefully sunny with a high chance that weather 
forecasts dont mean anything because this is Pittsburgh.
Despite your best efforts, you will not be successful in playing any 
practical jokes.
With less than 50 days until graduation, its probably too late to switch 
majors.
Congratulations on going another week without breaking down and 
eating five pounds of cheese balls.
You caffeine addiction will become painfully obvious when you actually 
begin to like Entropys coffee.
With spring break already a distant memory, dont forget to take some 
time off just for yourself  but dont forget that tomorrows exam is 
worth 25 percent of your grade.
Hold off on buying chocolate this week. Wait until after Easter to get 
everything on sale.
This is just common sense. Its not in anyones best interest for your to 
pursue a career in Jell-0 wrestling.
No. I know what youre thinking and the answer is no." Let it go.

A student by the name of Gallagher challenged any 
worthy competitor to a lemonade-drinking contest. 
Gallaghers record, 14 cups in 30 minutes, was 
rather intimidating. To reign supreme, competitors 
would have to drink a cup every two minutes. 
Thankfully, today we have outgrown competitions 
as childish as drinking contests.
Carnegie Tech presented the philosophical play 
titled Time Is a Dream. Critics described the play 
as a treatment of the unreality and relativity of time 
and life. The students, however, had a different 
take. One student replied that time is a dream, 
but only because her professors made it that 
way. Another student said that time isnt a dream, 
especially when there are only five minutes left 
during an exam.
Carnegie Mellons yearly spoof newspaper, The 
Natrat, covered a soccer game against the 
Punxsutawney Pee Wees. The Natrats were totally 
devastated with a final score of 98-1, the lone 
Natrat goal was scored when the goalie had to go 
pee pee and left the goal for a minute. On the up 
side, the Natrats had two more chances to redeem 
themselves in the coming days, when they were 
scheduled to compete against the Johnstown 
Juniors, followed by the Mount Lebanon Girl Scout 
Troop.
There was an interesting juxtaposition of characters 
in Pittsburgh this week. The separatist hate group, 
the Ku Klux Klan, rallied in downtown Pittsburgh, 
where they were met with much opposition, 
including protesters from Carnegie Mellon. Also 
this week, the Easter bunny visited campus - 
albeit it was just a person in a costume made to 
look like the real thing.
The website youcandealwithit.com depicted a 
suited woman looking up at a clock under the 
caption, "If time is money, how come I have 
so much of one and not the other?" In light of 
popular college stereotypes, 'this statement couldbe deconstructed in the following ways: It works for 
CFA, H&SS, and Tepper; it should be reversed for 
CIT (no time, but some money); and it doesnt apply 
at all for MCS (they have neither money nor time). 
Indeed, Carnegie Mellon has diversity!
The Tartan addressed the issue of online information 
disclosure by users of Facebook in an article called 
Facebook filled with interest and ignorance. With 
close to 70 percent of Carnegie Mellon students 
(as of late 2005) engaged in the social networking 
website, the article was well-timed. According to 
the article, the revolutionary social mechanism 
enables students to befriend, post messages 
to, and stalk others without needing to leave the 
comfort of their room. This is clearly something 
our already introverted college can do without!

the world wont listen.
Max Jordan | Photo Staff
Last Friday, Phil Collins (no, not the musician) visited the Carnegie 
Museum of Art to give a lecture on his new exhibit, Forum 59: 
Phil Collins. The exhibit showcases the world won't listen, Collins's 
video project, which features fans of The Smiths performing karaoke 
renditions of one of the band's songs, "The World Won't Listen." 
Forum 59 turns narcissism on its head, featuring some of the least 
talented  and yet most enthusiastic  singers this world has to 
offer.
