Despite all of the concentration on 
science and engineering at Carnegie 
Mellon University, two recently 
tenured English professors were able 
to grab the campuss attention when 
they received the prestigious 
National Endowment for the Arts 
(NEA) award for their work in cre
ative writing prose. Professors Jane 
Bernstein and Sharon Dilworth were 
each awarded $20,000 grants for 
their efforts as novelists.
Bernstein and Dilworth each 
received one of only 41 fellowships 
awarded among 908 applicants. 
Bernstein said that she and Dilworth 
had no idea that the other had 
entered a piece in the competition, 
and they were pleasantly surprised 
to hear that they both received 
grants.
Bernstein submitted chapters 
from the work-in progress Bereft: A 
Sisters Story, to be published in 
April by Northpoint Press. The book 
centers around the repercussions 
and consequences of her sisters 
murder. Some of Bernsteins other 
works include Departure, Seven 
Minutes in Heaven, and Loving 
Rachel.
Bernstein began her writing 
career at New York University, where 
she received a BA in Journalism and 
she continued on to receive an MFA 
in writing from Columbia University. 
Shes been working at CMU since 
1991. There are very few programs 
in the country who offer a degree in 
creative writing. We really pride our
selves in the fact that our entire 
department consists of active writ
ers, she said. Bernstein feels that 
the writers are a nice presence on 
campus. Bernstein said she plans to 
use the money from her fellowship 
to buy a laptop and perhaps use 
some of it to buy time for research.
Dilworth is the author of two col
lections of short stories, The Long 
White and Women Drinking 
Benedictine. She has received the 
Iowa Award in Short Fiction and a 
Pennsylvania Council on the Arts 
.Grant. Dilworth has been at CMU for 
11 years and is currently the Fiction 
Editor at Carnegie Mellon University 
Press. She is currently working on a 
novel called A Leaky Roof, which

Carnegie Mellon has recently 
added two new programs to its cur
riculum. Biomedical and Health 
Engineering (BHE) became a dou
ble major and Entertainment 
Technology is now a two-year grad
uate program. Both of these fields 
offer the latest in technology and 
research.
BHE is a new double major 
offered to CIT and MCS students. It 
is designed to give engineering stu
dents the ability to find solutions for 
problems in medicine and biology. 
The three core courses of the major 
focus on the fundamentals of the
sciences: physiology, modern biolo
gy, and chemistry. These courses are 
geared to help students who wish to 
pursue medical school or a PhD.
Michael Domach, a faculty mem
ber in Chemical Engineering (ChE) 
and BHE, and Dean John Anderson 
were the two advocates in trying to 
make the program a reality. The 
coming of President Cohen created 
a better climate and receptivity for 
broadening educational offerings 
here at CMU, said Domach. It was 
not super-formalized but we talked 
to students who graduated recently, 
students who are currently in the 
minor, and parents of prospective 
students. There was a lot of input.

Tired of mystery meat from 
Highlander? Dont worry, improve
ments are coming. Dining Services 
at Carnegie Mellon University 
recently made some major changes 
in the services offered and the way 
the program is run. Weve 
expanded and centralized a lot of 
things, said Harry Tsang, a junior 
business major and the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC) food 
chair.
For starters, Dine Xpress and 
Campus Xpress will now be taken at 
a larger variety of vendors, such as 
The O in Oakland. Other vendors 
are being discussed as well, such as 
the Subway on South Craig Street 
and the Eat' N Park in Squirrel Hill. 
I think increased options are 
important, Tsang said. You cant 
eat at the Highlander or the UC 
Vendors every day.
It gets really boring to go to the 
UC every day and I can never spend 
all of my money, so the new options 
sound awesome. CMU needs more 
variety, and I think that these 
changes are definitely needed and 
welcome ones, Danielle Gelfand, a 
first year H&SS undecided student.
Other on-campus food changes 
also reflect the demand to increase 
options, as well as make some ven
dors more readily available. The

Last Tuesday many students 
attended the first Carnegie 
1 Mellon Habitat for Humanity 
meeting looking to fulfill their 
need to help the less fortunate 
and use power tools.
Kevin Davies, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering major, 
ran the meeting along with his 
five co-organizers. They all 
expressed the desire to have a 
group on campus more consis
tently dedicated to Habitat for 
Humanity and also one that will 
work to bring the campus togeth
er, including students, faculty and 
staff. The idea here is to join the 
CMU campus together. This is one 
of our main goals, said Davies.
The group will attempt to fulfill 
these goals through their three 
main missions: build, fundraise, 
and educate. Davies said that he 
hopes to have eight building days 
this semester with around 15 peo
ple going on each. They will work 
on both the construction and 
reconstruction of homes in Beaver
County, Butler County, and in the 
Pittsburgh area. The first work
day will be February 12 in Beaver 
County. It will also be possible to 
participate in fundraising events 
such as the upcoming Home Show 
in Monroeville to help raise 
money for the Pittsburgh affiliate. 
Davies hopes to have speakers at 
the monthly meetings to discuss 
issues relating to the program, 
such as architects who could dis
cuss the process of designing the 
homes.
Davies said that he has alreadyparticipated in three or four work
days in Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
That was just enough to get me 
interested and realize that theres 
a lot of work to be done, he said. 
It was on a workday last fall that 
he met the groups current advi
sor, Chris Cook, and first realized 
the need to create an organization 
on campus solely devoted to 
Habitat for Humanity. Davies 
began to work with Tom Brown, a 
first year architecture major, 
Raymond Ip, a senior chemical 
engineering and psychology

Presidential candidates 
trade barbs before vote
boVa&uov b94S
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)  A1 
Gore and fellow Democrats jumped 
into bed with special interests 
during the 1996 fund-raising scan
dal, rival Bill Bradley said Sunday, 
as he struggled with questions 
about his own health two days 
before New Hampshires primary. 
Sen. John McCain claimed, 
Theres only one man who is fully 
prepared to be commander-inchief, and he said its not George W. 
Bush.
With polls showing Gores oncecommanding lead narrowing, the 
vice president struggled to deal 
with Bradleys sudden eagerness to 
attack. A political flame-thrower 
himself, Gore accused Bradley of 
impugning his integrity and step
ping down ... to the level of person
al vilification.
Bush, the two-term Texas gover
nor and national GOP front-runner, 
said his executive office experience 
would make for a better president. 
Tm not of the Washington scene. 
I'm not a committee chairman, 
Bush said, digging at Senate 
Commerce Committee chairman 
McCain.
Im the guy who can beat A1 
Gore, McCain replied, as the GOP 
and Democratic campaigns 
appeared headed for close finishes. 
McCain holds a slight edge or is tied 
with Bush in polls here, after lead
ing the Texan for eight weeks. 
Gores edge over Bradley is slightly 
wider, but that contest also could 
be close Tuesday.
Bradley, McCain, Bush and 
Republican Alan Keyes made the 
round of Sunday talk shows while 
the seven major-party White House 
hopefuls plowed toward Tuesdays 
vote with rallies and news confer
ences.
Running a distant third in 
Republican polling here, million
aire publisher Steve Forbes kept his 
eye on Bush. After the Texan told 
Fox News Sunday that he would 
cut taxes hopefully in the first 
term, Forbes questioned Bush's 
commitment to the issue.
I don't want to say, I told you so 
but having led with a timid tax cut 
and now hedging about whether he 
can even get that, I think this is part 
of the waffling and equivocating 
that people are tired of, Forbes 
said in an interview.
Keyes, the conservative fire
brand, picked up the endorsement
of David Schippers, chief GOP 
investigator for President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. He said the race 
between Bradley and Gore is a 
choice between the devil or 
Beelzebub.
Fellow conservative Gary Bauer, 
struggling to keep his candidacy 
alive, maintained a light schedule 
that included a Super Bowl party. 
Recognizing that football, not poli
tics, held voters interests Sunday, 
most of the candidates ended their 
day in front of the TV.
Lugging cheese popcorn and 
pretzels through a shopping center 
parking lot, Manchester voter 
Dennis Ekerson dismissed a politi
cal question with a laugh. Gary 
Bauer? Does he play for Tennessee 
or Los Angeles, the registered 
independent said.
Bradley, a former basketball star, 
has been slow to reveal details 
about his irregular heartbeat condi
tion and acknowledged Sunday 
that he has briefly undergone anes
thesia three times for treatment 
since December 1996.
He told ABC it would be appro
priate to invoke the 25th 
Amendment and turn power over to 
his vice president if he underwent 
the same treatment as president.
Though the candidate and his 
doctors say the condition is simply 
a medical nuisance, it could 
become a political problem if voters 
worry about his health.
Bradley lost badly to Gore in the 
Iowa caucuses last week and would 
be staggered by a second-straight 
defeat in New Hampshire. The for
mer lawmaker surrendered his lead 
to Gore in New Hampshire polls 
during the vice president's aggres
sive final week of campaigning in 
Iowa.
Bradley, however, has enough 
money to continue beyond this 
state, and released a schedule 
showing that he intends to do so. 
The next contests  a series of 
March 7 primaries  include states 
where Bradley is strong.
Since the waning days of the 
Iowa campaign, Bradley has been 
torn between a need to attack Gore 
and a fear that negative campaign
ing will tarnish his self-styled image 
as a non-politician. Daily polling, 
which is sometimes unreliable, 
showed Bradley edging toward 
Gore  and the vice president
seemed to be feeling the heat.Why would Senator Bradley 
break his promise to run a different 
kind of campaign and launch divi
sive, manipulative attacks? Gore 
asked supporters, as Democratic 
leaders backing the vice president 
urged Bradley to curb his criticism.
Bradley has turned the tables on 
Gore. The vice president revitalized 
his sagging campaign last fall by 
launching a full-throated case 
against Bradleys health care plan 
and questioning the former New 
Jersey senators commitment to the 
Democratic Party.
With aides promising still harder 
attacks, Bradley stopped short of 
calling Gore a liar. I don't think 
that he said the truth about his 
abortion record in Congress, 
Bradley told ABC.
At a rally later, Bradley waved a 
recent article about Gore's 1996 
fund-raising trip to a Buddhist 
Temple near Los Angeles and 
demanded an explanation. He said 
the fund-raising scandal was a dis
grace to both parties, particularly 
Democrats.
When we all get into bed with 
the special interests, I think that 
makes a more serious problem for 
us than for Republicans, Bradley 
said. He suggested that Gore's role 
in the fund-raising abuses would 
make him vulnerable to attacks by 
the GOP nominee.
Unless we clean up our own 
house, Republicans will clean it up 
for us this fall, he told ABC.
The ability to be elected presi
dent also was an issue on the GOP 
side, where Bush is closing the gap 
against McCain by pulling previ
ously undecided Republicans into 
the fold. McCain's candidacy 
depends on a strong turnout from 
New Hampshire independents.
McCain, who filled Peterborough 
City Hall with red, white and blue 
balloons and more than 1,000 peo
ple for his 114th  and final  
New Hampshire town hall, argued 
that his pledge to reform the politi
cal system makes him better suited 
to expose Gore's weaknesses. The 
Arizonan and Navy veteran said 
Bush is qualified to be president, 
but there's only one man who is 
fully prepared. I am fully pre
pared, particularly on military and 
foreign policy matters.

Death penalty on 
trial in Illinois
CHICAGO (AP)  Illinois has 
seen more of its death sentences 
overturned than it has carried out, 
so Gov. George Ryan plans to block 
executions altogether pending a 
special investigation, the Chicago 
Tribune reported Sunday.
The decision, to be announced 
Monday, would make Illinois the 
first state in the country to stop exe
cutions while it reviews its death 
penalty procedures, the newspaper 
reported.
You have a system right now ... 
thats fraught with error and has 
innumerable opportunities for inno
cent people to be executed, Ryan 
spokesman Dennis Culloton told the 
Tribune. The governor is deter
mined not to make that mistake.
Ryan still supports the death 
penalty, but Illinois has a problem 
thats too big for case-by-case 
review, Culloton said. Its clear the 
system is broken.Ryan will create a special panel to 
study the states capital punishment 
system in general and determine 
what happened in the 13 cases in 
which men were wrongly convicted 
since Illinois reinstated the death 
penalty in 1977.
Four hurt in train 
derailment in MD
BLOOMINGTON, Md. (AP)  A 
coal train derailed Sunday morning 
near the Maryland-West Virginia 
border, sending one of its cars plow
ing into a house and raining coal 
and debris on the five people who 
lived there. One woman was seri
ously injured and her teen-age son
was missing, state police said.
Scores of rescue workers with 
dogs continued searching through 
spilled coal, rubble and heavy snow 
Sunday evening for the missing boy, 
State Police Cpl. David Broadwater 
said.
Thirty-six of the train's 80 cars, all 
carrying coal, derailed shortly after 
6:30 a.m., CSX spokesman Gary 
Wollenhaupt said.
One rail car crashed into the twostory wooden house, which was 
pushed 25 feet off its foundation.
The cause of the derailment was 
not immediately determined.
Rescue workers extricated Libby 
A. Holstein, 35; her daughter 
Brandy N. Holstein, 18; Eugene F. 
Liller, 32; and his daughter Amanda 
M. Liller, 13. Mrs. Holstein was in 
serious condition at Cumberland 
Memorial Hospital. State police said 
the others were not seriously 
injured.

Riot troops raid 
Chechen towns
URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP)  
Sleeping babies broke out crying as 
Russian riot troops carrying auto
matic weapons, their jackets bulky 
with ammunition belts, descended 
on the Chechen town of UrusMartan on Sunday morning and 
detained at least a dozen men and 
20 cars, residents said.
Villagers in Stariye Atagi had a 
similar  and also unexplained  
wake-up call two days earlier, they 
said, when Russian troops swept in 
and beat or harassed dozens of 
unarmed residents. Nearly 60 peo
ple were detained.
Both towns are ostensibly under 
Russian occupation, but the raids 
echo descriptions by civilians 
throughout Chechnya of rough 
treatment by Russian soldiers  
treatment that is souring even 
peaceful Chechens on Russian rule.
Security has heightened since 
rebels surprised federal troops with 
attacks on Russian-held towns earli
er this month.
When the troops entered Lecha 
Khadashev's home, they roughly 
woke his three children and ran
sacked his 2-year-old daughter's cra
dle for weapons. He said they 
detained a relative, Salambek 
Adamov, because his passport 
showed he lives in Grozny.
Adamov, 34, is among dozens of 
refugees who fled fighting in 
Grozny in recent months to stay 
with family in Stariye Atagi. Nearly 
all male refugees in town were 
arrested Friday.
Russian military officers said 
Sunday they were under permanent 
orders to detain Chechens not living 
in the place designated on their
domestic passports, used in Soviet 
times to monitor and restrict travel.
Riot troops came down on UrusMartan on Sunday, raiding markets 
and homes. They seized 20 off-road 
vehicles, even those for which the 
owners' documents were in order. 
The rebels use off-road vehicles for 
travel to their bases in Chechnya's 
rugged southern mountains.
Dozens die in Sri 
Lankan fighting
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  
Government troops wielding rock
ets and machine guns attacked 
Tamil rebel bunkers in northern Sri 
Lanka over the weekend, killing 22 
rebels, the Defense Ministry said 
Sunday.
Also Sunday, a bomb exploded on 
a bus in northwestern Sri Lanka, 
wounding 19 passengers and two 
pedestrians, said M.R. Noordeen, a 
police officer. Two of the wounded 
were in serious condition at a local 
hospital.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam have been fighting for an 
independent state for minority 
Tamils since 1983. More than
61,000 people have been killed in 
the fighting.
On Saturday, soldiers killed 10 
rebels and wounded 13 others in an 
attack on Tamil bunkers in Jaffna 
peninsula. They also shot dead 
another seven rebels in clashes, the 
defense ministry said in a state
ment. One soldier was wounded in 
the fighting.
A rebel radio transmission inter
cepted Friday admitted the loss of 
another five guerrillas in the region, 
the ministry said.
A land mine explosion on Sunday 
killed two policemen and seriously
wounded three others near 
Vavuniya, 130 miles north of the 
capital, a police officer said.
Meanwhile, a newspaper report
ed Sunday that Sri Lanka will buy 
helicopters and other munitions as 
part of a multimillion dollar deal 
with the United States.
Sri Lankan military officers were 
not immediately available for com
ment.
An unidentified Spanish firm, 
under license from the United 
States, will supply high caliber 
ammunition to this small island 
nation off India's southern coast, 
the newspaper said.
Make more love, 
says Greek priest
ATHENS, Greece (AP)  In an 
appeal to Greeks to have more chil
dren, the outspoken leader of the 
countrys Orthodox Church said 
Sunday that married couples should 
not feel guilty about'having sex and 
may do so without specific intent to 
conceive.
During a sermon at an Athens 
church, Archbishop Christodoulos 
described lovemaking as a blessed 
act of marriage.
It is a gift God has given to man 
and it should not be considered a 
sin,' he said.
The Church is actively involved in 
a campaign to reverse Greece's 
declining birth rate. In recent years, 
the trend has forced the closure of 
scores of primary schools and 
prompted the government to con
sider reorganizing pension schemes 
and compulsory military service.
Last week, Christodoulos said the 
Orthodox Church might start sum
mer camps for young married cou
ples, allowing them to deepen their 
relationship.

Crime and
Incident
Report
1/22 STRANGE ODOR, 7:59
pm - While on another detail in 
Mellon Institute, Campus Police 
noticed a vinegar-like smell on the 
third floor loading dock area. Upon 
further investigation, the smell was 
found to be only in that loading 
area. Environmental Health and 
Safety was notified, and the odor 
was deemed acidic acid. The 
Mellon Institute storeroom and sur
rounding areas were checking, with 
negative results. The odor began to 
dissipate, and it was decided that 
the odor was nothing to worry 
about.
1/23 UNATTENDED/RECOV
ERED PROPERTY, 8:06am - An
unattended computer monitor was 
discovered during classroom open
ings in the A-level of Hamburg Hall. 
The monitor appears fairly new, but 
it is unknown who the owner is, or 
whether the property is operable. 
The monitor was brought to the 
Communications Center for safe 
keeping.
1/25 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 
11:07am - A blue chair cushion, a 
smashed table and a mangled win
dow screen were found on the 
ground outside the Westwing TV 
room. The debris was directly below 
the fifth floor Westwing lounge, 
which is missing a window screen, 
contains a blue chair without a 
cushion, and has a spot on the floor 
indicating the previous location of a 
table. The remains of the table were 
marked with CMU Housing identifi
cation.

table. The food at Skibo is also 
undergoing some changes. New 
salad options are going to be intro
duced, as well as other health food 
items from Curtis Natural Foods.
Elissa Lapide, a first year student
in the Science and Humanities 
Scholars, is enthusiastic about the 
new changes. Having the lounge 
in Skibo where students can hang 
out will be nice because it will add 
to the comfortable atmosphere that 
already exists there. It will be really
good to have new places to eat 
because sometimes the food choices 
here seem a little bit narrow.
The SDC Food Committee has 
talked a lot about these 
changes...Its the culmination of a 
lot of peoples ideas, said Tsang.

L.ph87B 6od9 
Electrical and Computer 
Engineering, had a minor in BHE. 
All of the BHE classes I have taken 
have been useful and interesting. By 
nature, biomedical engineering is 
very interdisciplinary, which gives 
the material covered a lot of variety 
and applicability, she said.
The Entertainment Technology 
Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon 
University is now offering a twoyear Masters of Entertainment 
Technology degree. The degree is a 
joint effort between the College of 
Fine Arts and the School of
Computer Science.The concept behind the program 
is based on the principle of having 
technologists and fine artists work 
together to produce artifacts that 
are intended to entertain, inform, 
and inspire.
Professor Don Marinelli, a profes
sor in the School of Drama, and 
Professor Randy Pausch, a professor 
in the SCS Human Computer 
Interaction Institute, are the direc
tors of the program. They currently 
have nine students in the MET 
degree program. The students are 
from both fine arts and computer 
science backgrounds.
It is our hope and intention that 
we become a high-visibility, exciting 
showpiece on campus, much like 
the Media Lab did for MIT, said 
Pausch.
I am tremendously excited at the 
prospects for the ETC, said Ian 
Mccullough, a senior in drama. "The 
twentieth century has seen the birth 
and boom of film, broadcast media, 
telecommunications, and comput
ing. These areas have begun to con
verge, creating the potential for 
types of artistic expression and 
entertainment that were unimagin
able to most 20 years ago.

Wendy Wan, both fifth year archi
tecture majors. Chris got us togeth
er and moving in the right direc
tion, said Davies.
I have organized numerous ser
vice projects for different service 
organizations. But very few projects 
have the impact on students as 
Habitat does. Students are always 
eager to sign up for Habitat projects. 
In part, I guess, it is the physical 
work that appeals to them... But 
one problem our campus has 
encountered is that there hasn't 
been an organization solely dedicat
ed to Habitat. Thus, it becomes diffi
cult for students if they wish to get 
involved with Habitat. Hopefully, 
with the creation of a new chapter, 
we could help to resolve this prob
lem, said Ip.
Habitat for Humanitys goal of 
providing decent simple housing for 
those in need was the personal 
vision of Millard Fuller, a millionaire 
who sold his business and all of his 
possessions in search of a more ful
filling and humanitarian life at the 
age of 29. Since 1976, Habitat has 
built more than 80,000 houses

2,000 communities with affordable

tates houses with the help of the 
future owner. Houses are sold to 
families for no profit and financed 
with no-interest loans. The monthly
mortgage payments are used to 
build more Habitat houses. I feel 
the general philosophical beliefs of 
Habitat are universally 
Humanitarian. Only caring builds 
good relationships and it is the foun

Fifth/Forbes plan must 
address citys heritage
It is a sad fact that the Pittsburgh 
downtown area is usually devoid of life 
throughout the day and on weekends. 
Other cities have centralized public 
spaces which serve to bring people into 
the city, and that helps support the local 
economy.
To solve this problem, city leaders 
have been debating a plan to restructure 
the Fifth and Forbes corridor. 
Specifically, Mayor Tom Murphy has 
proposed several changes that would 
alter the area. The plan seeks to revital
ize the downtown area of Pittsburgh by 
bringing in new businesses and econom
ic vitality to that section of the city. This 
type of urban renewal is desperately 
needed. However, in carrying through 
with a plan, the city must take into 
account the cultural and historical 
aspects that make city centers distinc
tive.
Under the current plan, 62 out of 64 
current retailers, many of whom have 
: been tenants for several generations, 
will be torn down. Of those buildings, 
only 12 facades will be left standing. 
The current plan runs the risk of demol(ishing much of the flavor that could 
make this marketplace successful, and is 
; a quick fix to a difficult and complex 
problem.
Many of the older establishments will 
; be relocated, with the promise of some 
incorporation into the Fifth and Forbes 
corridor at some point in time. The rest 
of the newly-created marketplace might 
include such upscale retailers as 
Nordstrom, J. Crew, and FAO Schwarz. 
However, no solid plan.exists to relocate 
i these older retailers, and there is a possiblity that some of them will be shut 
down. An effort should be made to preWhile there have been a number of 
new venues created for student use in 
recent years, one central space, the 
University Center (UC) basement, has 
been overlooked. Currently, nothing 
occupies it, although ideas for the area 
have been discussed since the UCs 
opening in 1996. Neither the adminis
tration nor Student Senate has formally 
taken any steps to gather input or pro
pose a plan for the basement. The origi
nal idea for the U was to establish a 
central location for students. Plans must 
be made to expand the rest of the build
ing for recreational use as well.
When the UC opened, the administra
tion put a three-year waiting period on 
the basement space to determine how it 
could best be used. That waiting period 
has now expired. One of the suggestions 
the administration has for the space is 
to make a centralized mailroom, where 
students could retain the same SMC as 
long as they remained on campus. 
Although the mailroom would not take 
up the entire space, the basement has 
rinany other possibilities, and should 
exclusively be for student use. Options

serve as many as possible.
Pittsburgh History and Landmarks has 
proposed the demolishment of only 34 
of the 64 buildings. In addition, Market 
Square,which is currently an open 
space, would be converted into a closed 
marketplace with an ice-skating rink on 
top of it.
Suggestions such as these can only 
help in the current planning stages, and 
more ideas need to be generated.
As it stands, many worry that 
Murphys plan will turn the area into an 
urban mall  a somewhat hipper ver
sion of the suburbs. Whatever the final 
plan for downtown, this outcome should 
be avoided. Instead, Pittsburgh should 
take a look at similar city centers that 
have been successful. Fanneull Hall in 
Boston is an example of how history and 
commercial enterprise have collided to 
create a rich and profitable consumer 
environment. Union Square in San 
Francisco blends small California bistros 
with high-class department stores. Our 
city, too, should have a center that is dis
tinctly Pittsburgh.
The architecture of the buildings 
along the Fifth/Forbes corridor is 
remarkable. One suggestion might be to 
have the center be an architectural time
line, whereby the city could demon
strate its history, even while integrating 
stores that are more fleeting, like The 
Gap.
The current buildings are a testament 
to the days of iron and steel, jazz, and 
community that make Pittsburgh 
unique. Simply rejecting them is not the 
answer to the citys need for renewal. 
Instead, a balance should be struck 
between attracting strong retailers and 
preserving Pittsburghs flavor.

laser tag arena, or even a central recre
ation room with some pool tables and a 
jukebox could provide a convenient 
place to meet people and socialize. 
Other ideas that have been proposed 
include additional stores, restaurants, 
and space for student organizations.
In the past four years the UC has suc
cessfully provided a much-needed 
venue for student use. The eateries, the 
exercise facilities, and the offices on 
the third floor have all served as part of 
many students everyday life at college. 
With the addition of job fairs, lectures, 
movies, concerts, and other events that 
take place in the UC, it becomes appar
ent that the site is well used. It is obvi
ous, then, that the basement space 
should be developed for what the UC 
was originally intended for: student 
use.
Students must go to their Senators 
and suggest ideas on how to best use the 
UC basement. If there is enough interest 
in a central recreational facility, Senate 
has the ability to implement student 
input.

Marketing floods campus
Editor:
After reading the article in the Jan. 24th 
edition of the Tartan concerning over-mar
keting on campus, I felt it was my duty as a 
marketing representative to say a few 
words myself.
While companies have every right to 
advertise as it is necessary for them to be 
competitive, there is a definite line 
between competitive marketing and over
marketing. For example, putting posters up 
on public bulletin boards is perfectly
0l9d b&ga
They paved paradise, and they put up a 
parking lot.
Those are the words of the splendid 
singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. Theyre 
also the fighting words of Tony DiNardo, 
owner, of Graffiti Showcase Cafe.
Last week, David Scaife purchased the 
building that houses this musical venue as 
well as Auto Palace Sales and Service. His 
intention: keep the luxury car dealership 
intact and turn Graffiti into a luxury car 
parking lot.
For all those who are new to Pittsburgh 
and think that Scaife is just a name for an 
ugly building on our campus, here is a 
quick biography on the Scaife family. David 
Scaife is the son of Greensburg TribuneReview publisher Richard Mellon Scaife. 
The only thing more conservative than the 
sound of Richard Mellon Scaifes 
name is his politics. This is the 
right-wing millionaire who spent 
millions of dollars towards dig
ging up dirt on Bill Clinton. And it 
appears that the old aphorism is 
true: Like father, like son.
Its not that his son David is 
financing a reactionary coup of 
political leaders, its just that 
David may have possibly commit
ted one of the worst public rela
tions (PR) acts of all time. Even 
though Graffiti is only 16 years 
young, it has hosted tons of musi
cal acts while the bands were in 
their infancy, including Nirvana,
The Replacements, and Green 
Day. More importantly, this was a 
major source of entertainment for 
college students because of its 
convenient location in Oakland.
Scaife has clearly made a bad 
choice in real estate purchases.
Now, even though Im not con
servative like Scaife, I do believe 
that if you can afford something 
thats for sale, you have the right 
to buy it. But again, this issue is 
not about a wrongful purchase.
Its about bad PR.
There have already been 
enough reasons explaining why 
Graffiti is a cool place for young people to 
hang out and listen to good music. But the 
ultimate in stupidity is the parking lot con
version. Whether its two-dimensional 
asphalt or three-dimensional concrete, an 
area for parked, unoccupied vehicles just 
isnt pretty. Finally, the ultimate in sense
less PR atrocities is that it is going to be a
acceptable. Putting them in elevators, 
bathrooms, and stairways, on doors, win
dows, and the ground all seems a bit much 
to me.
There is such a thing as too much adver
tising and marketing gone way too far. If 
you feel a company has gone too far, tell 
them! This is the most direct approach to 
getting this problem resolved. If that com
pany doesnt listen to your concerns then it 
is not the kind of company you want to be 
doing business with.
As the marketing representative for BIGWORDS.com, I have had a number of conluxury car parking lot.
Graffiti has to officially vacate the build
ing by March 31. Its not hard to mentally 
picture teary-eyed teenagers streaming out 
of the building screaming as their weaklyorganized protest fails and the wrecking 
ball smashes through the front faade. 
Meanwhile, wealthy old people are lining 
up on Baum Boulevard just waiting to park 
their BMWs and Mercedes in the new park
ing lot that will be put there. The whole 
thing sounds like a poorly-written episode 
of Saved By The Bell or Full House.
So the question remains, is this the worst 
PR move of all time? Lets take a brief look 
at other possible bad PR moves.
First, theres the accidental PR move. A 
good local example of this occurred last 
year when Pottery Barn published the 
address of its Shadyside location and listed 
the Steel City as Pittsburg in one of their 
nationally-distributed catalogs. All the 
yinzers were outraged. The phone at the 
store rang off the hook with peoples complaints. Letters were written and boycotts 
were made. But of course, as bad as this 
move was upon a city full of pride, it was 
completely accidental.
Another type is the completely intention
al move. Last year, a new law was passed 
where college students caught smoking pot
 or any other controlled substance 
cerns expressed to me about not just my 
company, but how other textbook 
companies such as Limespot.com, 
OrangeSorbet.com, and Varsitybooks.com 
do business. All of these companies should 
have email addresses on their Web pages of 
people to contact with your comments. 
Your opinions are important, so let yourself 
be heard.
Thank you,
Tracey Thompson 
Sophomore

could lose all their financial aid. This act 
completely mortified and upset its target 
group. However, that was probably the 
point. In fact, non-college students may 
have thought this was a good maneuver.
Scaifes move probably falls somewhere 
in between intentional and unintentional; 
hes conscious of what hes doing, but justdoesnt care. And thats the worst PR move 
of aU.
Meanwhile, this move will lead to a viscious cycle of bad PR moves. Once all the 
young Graffiti-goers are kicked onto the 
streets, theyll be smoking crack and drink
ing Mickeys in brown lunch bags. Then 
Scaife will bribe local politicians to enact a 
curfew for teenagers to be home by sun
down. There will be a violent backlash to 
this from the younger generation, followed 
by an even harsher reaction from Scaife, 
and so on.
Lets just hope that Graffiti can relocate 
soon to some place nearby. And when it 
does, lets pray that rich, conservative
tycoons keep their paws and hood orna
ments away.

Editor who frequents places like Graffiti 
when great bands come and put on a show.

between a concert and a show.

U.S. makes use of dangerous depleted uranium in war
b9av 2oFlo
the military often explain that DU is only 
mildly radioactive, that it cannot possibly be 
responsible for the huge increases in birth 
defects and cancer in Iraq reported by the 
UNICEF and the World Health Organization,
decided, it is unlikely that health effect 
reports by Gulf War veterans today are the 
result of exposure to depleted uranium dur
ing the Gulf War. But the PAC conceded it 
had many problems with its data, and that
Recently, I read with interest an article per
taining to the United States militarys use of 
chemical warfare in the Vietnam War. One of 
these weapons, Agent Orange, is a defoliant 
that the Air Force used to clear targets for 
bombing. Since the war, the alarming 
increase in illnesses and birth defects in the 
Vietnamese population, as well as the parallel 
ailments of exposed American soldiers, have 
prompted inquiry into its obvious biologically 
harmful effects. To provide often-requested 
answers, the Air Force itself was called upon 
rto explore and report on these effects. Not 
surprisingly, Congresss General Accounting 
Office (GAO) charged that the Air Force 
'waited eight years before releasing data it 
obtained in 1984 linking Agent Orange to 
birth defects in veterans children, that the 
military deliberately withheld information 
from interested scientists and veterans, and 
that scientists requested by veterans groups 
to take part in the study were not allowed to 
do so until 1990. The GAO report also went 
on to explain that Reagans White House and 
Air Force management interfered with the 
research, which is not yet complete; the 
Pentagon had no immediate response.
. Upon victory in the Gulf War, George Bush 
.proclaimed that the Vietnam Syndrome  
^the general anti-militarist sentiment in 
America  had finally been conquered. The 
mainstream media has been applauding ever 
; since; war is generally not criticized, perhaps 
because the militarys interests are the same 
jnterests of the immensely powerful corpora
tions that own it as well as the news media. 
This might also explain the tremendous igno
rance of the Agent Orange of our time: deplet
ed uranium (DU).
DU is a radioactive substance that is used 
with munitions because its extreme density 
makes it effective for piercing armor plates. 
The metal is pyrophoric, which means that it 
burns under pressure, or as the Department 
of Defense (DoD) explains, it self-sharpens. 
Most other substitutes are less effective 
because they mushroom on impact. During 
this oxidation process, the DU is converted 
into airborne dust particles. Apologists for

as well as unexplained illnesses in Gulf War 
veterans and similar birth defects in their 
children reported by veterans groups. But 
what they fail to reveal is that the spewed 
dust can be inhaled and ingested, which cre
ates enormous health risks. Furthermore, 
competent scientists have independently 
made persuasive arguments that DU particles 
thus become trapped in the lungs, kidneys, 
and bones, resulting in cancer and genetic 
mutation.
The official line on DU, however, is provid
ed by the military itself, much like the Air 
Forces research on Agent Orange. In 1997, 
the Presidential Advisory Committee (PAC)
any further investigation of possible chemi
cal or biological agents during the Gulf War 
should be conducted by a group independent 
of the DoD. The report was so inadequate as 
to contain unqualified speculations by a mili
tary nuclear scientist on the biological effects 
of DU, as well as references to the small 
doses that soldiers were exposed to, when in 
fact the dosage levels were not known. The 
RAND report on DU, released in 1999, is yet 
another cursory dismissal, noting that it must 
be harmless because there is no peerreviewed documentation that it is harmful.
On the other hand, there are several con
tradictions to these findings provided by the
military itself. Studies are never conducted in 
Iraq, where troops were heavily cautioned 
against even coming near the remains of tar
gets destroyed by DU-hardened shells specifi
cally because of the radiation risk.
Environmental scientist 
Doug Rokke led a team to 
clean up supposedly harm
less uranium in Iraq shortly 
after the Gulf War. Today 
he has kidney and lung 
problems, four of his col
leagues have died, and 
twenty-four others are suf
fering from various Gulf 
War Syndrome illnesses. 
Astoundingly, NATO has 
admitted that it used DU in 
its recent air war with 
Yugoslavia, but refuses to 
reveal to the United Nations 
how much or where exactly 
it was used. The UN sought 
to provide a task force to 
document possible effects. 
A British Ministry of 
Defense spokesman
explained, The danger 
from depleted uranium is 
that a dust is generated... 
The concern is inhalation. 
And a NATO official, upon 
breaking the news of its use 
of DU, noted that it could 
cause complications if 
ingested
Despite the military and 
plutocratic dominance of 
the issue of DU, Congress 
can be persuaded to inter
vene with what little of a democratic system 
we have left in the matter of military and for
eign policy issues. The campaign against the 
use of DU has been spearheaded by several 
groups including the International Action 
Center, founded by former U.S. Attorney 
General Ramsey Clark. What is necessary is a 
public outcry, a questioning of militarism that 
is both immoral and profitable only for Big 
Business  a resurgence of the dreaded 
Vietnam Syndrome.

But the benefits dont quite 
make up for the annoyances. 
Rebecca 7, TlaF1Si Every dash to class is now a long
Q Snow stinks.
While this insight hardly classifies as 
breathtakingly new, the weather since weve 
gotten back to school has kept reminding me 
how true it is. In the last two weeks, this cam
pus has seen at least three separate dumpings 
cof snow, countless assorted flurries, and a 
.temperature that seems permanently stuck 
below freezing. You know its bad when you 
see that the thermometer might hit a whop
ping 25F for the day and consider breaking 
out the tank tops.
This weather isnt all bad, of course. The 
"'freezing cold means that those who avoid 
.-physical activity at all times are momentarily 
; joined by pretty much everyone else. If getJ ting to the weight room or the exercise 
: machines suddenly requires lots of exertion in 
| itself, you feel completely justified in not even 
| trying to use them. Covered in several inches 
; of snow, the campus looks still and beautiful. 
\ Even Wean looks slightly less hideous. And 
; theres always the chance to regress back to 
j your childhood through traying, snowball 
fights, or trying to determine once and for all
trek across the bleak and frozen tundra. If 
youre like me, you start to consider sticking a 
little yak meat in your backpack to fortify you 
on the treacherous journey from The Hill to 
Baker. And if you live off campus, the situa
tion is even worse. May I suggest staying 
home and taking a nice long nap? Say, until 
mid-March.
Then theres the weather hazards unique to 
the CMU campus. Like the hot water in McGill 
that conveniently stopped working just at the 
time when it would be most useful. Or the 
construction work that blocks the way and 
makes every walk just that much longer when 
you want to be inside as quickly as possible. 
Although I am grateful that they finished the 
Newell-Simon building, with that tunnel to 
Wean that lets students go from Doherty to 
near Hamburg  all without having to go 
outside. Maybe the next phase of construc
tion could be building passageways that con
nect every building on campus, so we never 
have to go outside if we dont want to. That 
exposed steam pipe outside of Donner that 
theyre trying to fix is nice too. If the tunnelconstruction idea doesnt work, perhaps they
could just dig holes above all the steam pipes 
so the warmth flows out. It would be kind of 
like a network of space heaters, only smellier 
and more industrial-looking.
The timing of this spate of snowstorms 
seems a little suspicious. The weather was 
lovely over the end of winter break, only to 
turn colder than an untouched Highlander 
dinner, with appropriate precipitation, right 
when classes were about to start. You would 
almost think someone up there didnt want 
CMU students the least bit tempted to leave 
the clusters.
One thing this weather has showed me is 
that Pittsburgh kicks my home states butt any 
day when it comes to dealing with snow. 
Maryland has many things to offer, yet it has 
this slight overreaction problem when it 
comes to snow. The merest chance of a dust
ing will lead to half-hour lines in supermar
kets as people stock up for the possibility of 
Armageddon. Schools panic and close if the 
roads are even remotely icy. My county can
celed classes for two weeks during the big 
blizzard of 1996  so much that I was actual
ly eager to go to school again by the end of it.
In contrast to Maryland, Pittsburgh can 
handle snow. Six inches worth doesnt seem 
to throw anyone for a loop. PAT buses dont 
run any more or less slowly than they usually 
do. I stopped by Giant Eagle last Saturday
evening, a few hours before it was supposed 
to start snowing heavily, and the lines werent 
bad at all  comparable to pre-flurry levels 
back in Maryland.
Then again, maybe Maryland has an 
excuse. At the moment, theyre getting more 
snow than we are. One of the storms last 
week missed Pittsburgh entirely, only to 
dump about a foot of snow on Maryland 
before heading further south. Now North 
Carolina, of all places, is coated with a thick 
blanket of snow. To heighten the irony even 
further, an ice storm hit the deep south on 
Saturday night. So we in Pittsburgh can at 
least be smug about the fact that people who 
normally spend the winter in t-shirts are 
every bit as cold as miserable as we are, for a 
little while.
Fortunately, theres still people we can 
envy. Just think about it  somewhere like 
Australia is probably enjoying a blisteringly, 
swelteringly hot summer right about now. 
Anybody in with me on plane tickets down 
there next weekend?

tank of gas. Game time is at 7:30 
pm most nights, so if you time the 
trip right, you can roll into 
Wheeling just as happy hour gets 
underway, at the River City Ale 
Works, conveniently located a block 
from the Wheeling Civic Center.
Although Id been to Wheeling 
only a few times for the citys gruel
ing Elb/s Big Boy Classic 20K race 
held each May, finding the arena for 
the first time couldnt be simpler.
When you get off the highway at 
Exit 1A, simply turn left and youre 
on the citys main drag. Just a few 
blocks more and you reach 14th 
Street, where you can save yourself 
a lot of struggle by parking in the 
garage located right beside the Civic 
Center (more on this later). And in 
less time than it takes to make it 
downtown in Pittsburgh during 
rush hour traffic, youre ready for a 
Nail City Night Out.
I highly recommend you start 
your hockey night by experiencing 
the polished atmosphere and 
friendly company at the Ale Works. 
Boasting five beers that, are brewed 
on site and a mini-museum and art 
gallery featuring local luminaries, 
the Ale Works is the latest addition 
to the communitys small but 
endearingly accessible downtown. 
From 5 - 7 pm., weeknights, you can 
sample some of the restaurants 
hand-crafted brews or tasty appetiz
ers for half price, and probably 
strike up a conversation with a local 
who may just end up in the seat 
beside you at the game later.
During my meal I had the plea
sure of making acquaintances with 
one Mrs. Ed, and her husband 
Mr. Ed," who, to my surprise, 
revealed himself to be the coach of 
the Bellaire Middle School CrossCountry team, which my school 
used to run against each season.
Mr. and Mrs. Ed were just two of 
the many friendly Wheeling natives 
I met on my trip, who were only too 
happy to assure me that my parking 
space in the closed bank lot was safe 
(still more on this later), and slight
ly shock me with the revelation that 
theyve considered moving to my 
hometown. Well, last time I 
checked, dinky little Dover, Ohio 
didnt have a minor league hockey 
team, so after spending just $13 on 
four beers and a burger, it was time 
for me to get to the game.
Tickets for a game at the 
Hammerdome max out at $11, but 
you can get a decent center ice seat 
for as cheap as $8. Before you buy, 
though, check out the Nailers Web
site atwww.wheelingnailers.com and 
click on the seating sections to see 
what your view will be. I opted for 
the ritzy route for the game I saw, 
and found myself in the season tick
et holders section, where the sightlines were supreme and the popula
tion relatively sparse.
Even though the Nailers have 
enjoyed some success in the eight 
years theyve been a part of the 
Wheeling community, theyre cur
rently in last place in the Northwest
Division, and stuck in a four game 
skid. So seats werent hard to come 
by, even though I actually saw a 
scalper outside the arena. His 
price? Free, if you promised to have 
a good time.
If you find that story unbeliev
able, then youll have take my word 
for the quality of hockey that was 
played at the Hammerdome Friday 
night. The 12-year-old ECHL lauds 
itself as the largest professional 
developmental league in North 
America, boasting 28 franchises 
stretching from Louisiana to 
Connecticut, 23 of which are direct
ly associated with a National 
Hockey League team.
The Nailers are the lowest rung 
on the Penguins developmental 
ladder, with the next stop for 
would-be NHL stars at the American 
Hockey Leagues Wilkes
Barre/Scranton team. But the hock
ey was far from second-rate.
Even though the Nailers fell 
behind 3-1, and ultimately lost 4-2 
to the first-place Richmond 
Renegades after pulling their goalie 
to make an empty-netted run in the 
closing minute, the pace was fast, 
the checks were solid, the passing 
was crisp, and some of the saves and 
shots were as exciting as those youll 
find in any NHL rink.
The way the crowd got behind its 
home team was more inspiring to 
me than sitting elbow to elbow with 
the corporate corpses at the Civic 
Arena, who wouldnt know a goodold fashioned wave if it swept 
upon them and knocked the $15 
calamari dishes from their hands. If 
only WesBanco Buck, the giant 
skating beaver mascot of the 
Nailers, could make a trip to
Pittsburgh, hed hitch a ride on the 
Zamboni and fire a t-shirt right at 
their cell-phone yapping faces! Let 
me tell you, theres nothing like 
small-town hockey to bring back 
your foam-fingered team spirit!
As for minor league hockeys 
effect on my wallet, the final cost of 
the trip came to $24, not counting 
gas, which if you bring three or four 
of your hockey mad friends wont 
amount to more than two dollars a 
person. And as for the small matter 
of my parking in a private bank lot, 
when I left the game all giddy and 
pumped from three hours of arena 
action, I found my car to be ... 
nowhere in sight! After frantically 
asking directions from a friendly, 
yes, but compass-challenged 
Wheeling pizza boy, I eventually 
made it to the Wheeling Police 
Station, whose Car #4 was kind 
enough to give me a ride out to the 
impound lot to pick up my car.
Not to put a damper on the fiscal
ly free spirit of this columns first 
road trip, but when all was said and 
done I had forked over $50 cash to 
Coot the tow truck driver, enough to 
keep his dog Bosco in Purina for a 
year.
So, by all means, take this road 
trip and experience Wheeling 
Nailers hockey for yourself, but take 
my advice and just park in the 
garage. And say hi to Mr. and Mrs. 
Ed if you see them.
Stop #2:1 Otter Go Some lime
Suffice to say, the further lighten
ing of my wallet after the bank park
ing lot episode made me put the sec
ond leg of this road trip on hold for 
awhile.
But let me at least introduce you
to the Ontario Hockey Leagues Erie 
Otters. Though the trip to Erie will 
require more from your gas budget 
while traveling up 79 North, the 
hockey should prove more than 
worth the cost of topping off your 
tank. The OHL is one of three 
leagues that make up the Canadian 
Hockey League, which consists of 
53 teams in eight Canadian 
provinces and four U.S. states. 
Canadian League hockey is hockey 
as it used to be played, when a jer
sey was a sweater and an arena a

This year has unofficially been 
dubbed the year of the freshman 
in college basketball. There is a pre
ponderance of precocious first-year 
players making a big impact on 
teams across the country. A prime 
example of this is the Arizona 
Wildcats. Like Mike Bibby before 
him, point guard Jason Gardner is 
leading the team to a top ten rank
ing as a freshman.
This freshmen explosion has 
caused much discontent in the 
world of college basketball. In the 
good old days, when Kareem was 
still Lew Alcindor and there was no 
March Madness, freshmen werent 
even eligible to compete at the var
sity level. There was a movement 
spearheaded by Indiana coach 
Bobby Knight to return to the fresh
man ineligibility rule this off-sea
son, but thankfully for college hoop 
fans, it wasnt enacted.
The abundant senior leadership 
present on most highly ranked 
teams in the country has been lost 
in the fuss over the emergence of 
freshmen this season. Coach Knight 
should know this better than any
one, as senior guard A. J. Guyton has 
taken the Hoosiers on his back and 
led them to their best start in years. 
An analysis of the top teams in the 
country will show that the best 
teams are those that are able to
combine veteran leadership with 
young talent.
The number one team in the land, 
Cincinnati, is a perfect example of 
this. Silky smooth 6'9" freshman 
guard Dermarr Johnson has been 
starting all season and is the teams 
third leading scorer. Kenny 
Satterfield, another first year play
er, has recently stepped in as the 
starting point guard. For the first 
time in years, the Bearcats have a 
point guard with solid basketball 
skills.
However, the real key to the team 
has been its seniors. Kenyon 
Martin, regarded by many as the 
best player in the country, has 
added a solid offensive game to his 
rebounding and shot blocking skills 
to become a dominant player. Few 
can match forward Pete Mickeal in 
attacking the basket, and he consis
tently shuts down the opposing 
teams leading scorer. Not to be for
gotten are power forwards 
Jermaine Tate and Ryan Fletcher, 
who provide solid defense and occa
sional points.
The next three teams in the rank
ings have a similar makeup. For the 
number two Stanford Cardinal, 
freshman forwards Curtis 
Borchardt and Casey Jacobson have 
played a large role in the teams suc
cess. The uncontested heart and 
soul of the team, however, is senior 
power forward Mark Madsen. As I 
wrote last week, a similar situation 
is taking place at Duke.
The number three Blue Devils 
have three freshmen starting, with 
Carlos Boozer, Jason Williams, and 
Mike Dunleavy, Jr. Playing the role 
of key senior is forward Chris 
Carrawell. And, lets not forget the 
number four Syracuse Orangemen. 
Seniors Etan Thomas, Ryan 
Blackwell, and Jason Hart have 
joined freshman Deshaun Williams 
in leading the Orangemen to their 
perfect start.
There is a trend here, and what it 
indicates is quite obvious. Despite 
the impact that freshmen are having 
across the country, having talented 
19-year-olds isnt enough to propel 
teams to the top of the rankings. 
The leadership and experience 
which veterans bring to the table is 
essential for a team aspiring to 
reach the final four.
With more underclassmen declar
ing for the NBA draft every season, 
talented seniors are a rare commod
ity. It has become much easier to 
recruit a dynamic freshman class 
than it is to keep them in school for 
four years. Those teams that are 
able to do both undoubtedly have 
an advantage over the rest of the 
country, as the current landscape in 
the NCAA shows.
Although freshman and sophomore-dominated teams such as 
Arizona, Depaul, and Florida may 
disagree, I have no doubt that the 
eventual national champion this 
season will have a strong veteran 
element.
der, here youll hear Oh Canada 
before every game.
The Otters play their games at 
'Rillio Arena, and tickets range from 
$6 to $10. They play 11 more home 
games this season, so get your friends 
together and get up north to check
them out. And if you find a restaurant 
with the same atmosphere and afford
ability as the River City Ale House, be 
sure to let me know. But if you end up 
paying $50 to spring your car from 
one of Eries cutthroat impound lots, 
dont say I didnt warn ya.
Colt Foutz would like to give one 
more shout out to Mr. Ed, who 
may have spilled his beer at the bar, 
but didnt dampen any spirits. And as 
for the tow truck driver, well, 
Foutz would just like to shout 
at him.

Done with season doser, Tartan swimming awaits UAA championships
Fr 2laou 7saVi
Contributing Editor
The Tartans swim meet last 
Saturday versus Allegheny was sig
nificant for two reasons. It ushered 
in the final leg of preparation before 
the UAA Swimming and Diving 
Championships  which take place 
February 10-12 in Atlanta  and 
served as the final home competi
tion for nine Tartan swimmers and 
divers.
These nine seniors are significant 
for their role in the major turn
around of Carnegie Mellons swim 
program. They also constitute a 
class of swimmers that head coach 
David Belowich guided from their 
first to senior years. As usual, the 
seniors and all of the Tartan team 
failed to disappoint in their season 
closer against Allegheny College.
It was a good warm-up for the 
Championships, said coach 
Belowich. There are times in a sea
son when you need to be tired or 
rested. Now is not the time. We 
need to be peaking.
By looking at the results, the 
Tartan men are peaking at just the 
right time. They finished first place 
in every event except diving, taking
the top two places in one event, top 
three in two events, and the top four 
spots in three events. The final 
point total was 158-64, and was 
their second largest margin of victo
ry this season.
I was going to swim exhibition 
for the last few events but the 
[Allegheny] coach said it would be 
an insult if we did, said Belowich. 
Far be it from me to insult anyone.
Leading the way for the Tartans 
with first-place finishes were sopho
more Ian Peters in the 200-yard 
freestyle and 100-yard breaststroke, 
senior Mike Robinson in the 50-yard 
freestyle, junior Rob Gallagher in 
the 200-yard individual medley, 
junior George Heidinger in the 100- 
yard butterfly, junior Jon Alpert in 
the 100-yard freestyle, sophomore 
Sean Belowich in the 100-yard 
backstroke, and first-year Billy 
Gains in the 500-yard freestyle.
[The first-year swimmers] have 
filled in much of what some of our 
needs were, said coach Belowich, 
referring to the strong perfor
mances from Gains, 'sophomore 
transfer students Monica Costlow 
and Katie Dickey, and the other new 
recruits.
The Allegheny women were more

more swimmers than the mens 
team, Allegheny defeated CMU 
137-58. It was not a bad loss by any 
measure, however, and the Tartans 
came on strong later in the meet, 
continuing their dominance in the 
100 yard breaststroke and winning 
the last event of the afternoon, the 
200-yard free relay.
My best stroke was there today, 
said senior team co-captain Amy 
Freed. [The meet] was very loud 
and very exciting.
Junior Julie Tseng grabbed a first 
place finish in the 200-yard 
freestyle, while senior co-captain 
Erin Rockwell once again ruled the 
100-yard breaststroke, finishing 
nearly four seconds ahead of the 
second place swimmer.
The Tartan relay team of sopho
more Erin Andrew, Costlow, Tseng, 
and Rockwell finished the meet 
strong with a close win in the 200- 
yard free relay.
I think the team is more together 
this year, said Rockwell. [In the 
next few weeks] theyll have to stay 
excited but focused on UAAs.
The Tartan men concluded their 
schedule with a dual meet record of 
7-1, while the women finished 5-3. 
They face their toughest competi
tion of the year at the
Championships, however, since 
three of the top UAA teams have the 
potential to rank in the top 20 teams 
in the nation, according to coach 
Belowich.
Its extremely difficult some
times to know you cant control
what the other team does, said 
Rockwell. It would be nice to finish 
in the top spot but its not the only 
thing.
Both teams struggled in an earlyseason meet versus UAA frontrunners Johns Hopkins, Emory, and
NYU, with the men finishing third 
out of four teams and the women 
finishing fourth. With the level of 
competition so high, the Tartans 
will concentrate on swimming 
career-bests and letting the score 
fall as it may.

Hockey on winning streak, strengthens playoff position
Fr Clau 31IoS
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Ice Hockey 
team has carried the strong 
momentum of the fall semester into 
the second half of its season, win
ning all three of its league matches 
since returning from winter recess 
and placing itself in prime position 
for the playoffs.
On January 23, the Tartans 
returned from their away match at 
the Indiana Ice Center with a 3-2 
victory over Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania. Goals were recorded 
by junior wingman Fred Peck and 
first line center Rob Ready. Pecks 
goal marked his first in a Tartan 
uniform.
Last Friday night the Tartans 
faced another away game chal
lenge against Washington & 
Jefferson College. Although the 
Tartans maintained a far better
record than the winless 
Washington & Jefferson squad, 
Washington and Jefferson was 
able to hold on to a 1-0 lead 
throughout the first two periods. 
Although its offense was mediocre, 
Washington & Jefferson played an 
extremely sound defensive game, 
continually shutting down the 
potent Tartan offense.
Ultimately, Carnegie Mellons 
scoring came from its defense, 
specifically sophomore Eliot 
Minichiello. Halfway through the 
third period, Minichiello carried 
the puck up the ice and buried it 
behind the Washington & Jefferson 
goaltender for the game-tying goal. 
Minichiello proceeded to score the 
winning goal several minutes later 
with a hard wrist shot from the out
side left circle.
The game ended in a 3-1 victory, 
after senior wingman and captain 
Dan Grosso clinched the victory 
with an empty net goal.
Carnegie Mellon hosted 
California University of 
Pennsylvania on Saturday at Neville 
Ice arena in the South Side. This 
was a highly anticipated game for 
the Tartans, as California was one 
of the few teams able to defeat 
Carnegie Mellon last semester.
The fast-paced first period result
ed in a combined seven goals. 
California scored the first goal at 
the beginning of the opening peri
od. The Tartans were unfazed, 
however, and they responded with 
a goal from senior Shane Davis thir
ty seconds later.
At 10:37 in the first period, 
Ready added another goal to the 
Tartans tally and scored yet anoth
er goal 27 seconds later. California 
was able to score again, but the 
Tartans responded with two more 
goals from Grosso and graduate 
student Esa Ylipahkala. The first 
period ended with the Tartans lead
ing 5-2.
California gained the only goal of 
the second period, which was fairly 
uneventful in all other respects. The 
third period was dominated by the 
Tartans. Ready scored his third 
goal of the . game at 12:14 to finish 
off the hat trick, and Ylipahkala 
buried his second shot of the 
evening, which happened to be 
short-handed.
The Tartans won the game 7-3, 
despite the fact that California was 
given nine power play chances 
throughout the course of the game 
compared to Carnegie Mellons oneopportunity. Grosso and
Ylipahkala each had three points 
this game, while Ready finished 
with four points.
The Tartan league record now 
stands at 8-4, while their overall 
record is 12-5. If the . Tartans 
continue at this pace, they could 
enter the playoffs ranked as first 
or second place in the entire 
league.

Well, wake up and smell the 
$5.00 hot dogs! The Penguins did
nt go bankrupt overnight, and 
chances are, theyre not waiting for 
penniless college students like us to 
financially boost their way back to 
fiscal responsibility. In other 
words, were priced out, and Im not 
talking just the $125.00 Igloo seats 
at center ice, where suit-clad social 
types sit on their monogrammed 
seat cushions and wait for the next 
touchdown. Even the cheapest 
seats you can buy at the Mellon
Arena (formerly Civic Arena) start 
at $20 and land you up in the cor
ners, where the Zamboni and Jagr 
appear to be about the same size.
And buying from the scalpers? 
Lets put it this way: my only sug
gestion for securing a ticket this 
way is holding up a twenty and hop
ing the guy laughs so hard he drops 
the ticket, after which you can 
snatch it and run to the gate, where 
once safely inside you can look for
ward to that aisle seat way up in 
section ZZ. I hear a pretzel vendor
came very near death while 
attempting the climb last season, 
and had to be rescued by the Mellon 
Bank arena blimp.
Before you go to all this trouble 
though, let me suggest a cheaper 
alternative that will put you in the 
best place to view the blood, blue 
lines, back-checks, and giant skat
ing beaver mascots that make up 
the excitement of arena hockey. 
Why dont you stop searching for 
that game on TV and join me for the 
first installment of The I Column

going, you dont need binoculars!
Stop #1: Nail City Night Out
The first stop on my weekend

Talented trio brings modern 
flair to classic compositions
Fr 5ioee91S 2avvsou
Staffwriter
Recipients of applause and acco
lade from critics and fans alike, the 
talented Eroica Trio will play at the 
Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland 
today.
Before they hit Carnegie, the 
group spent th weekend playing at 
various businesses around town. 
These appearances gave the curious 
listener a chance to check out the 
trio for free. Perhaps the attendees 
had heard the wonderful reviews 
such as The New York Times com
mentary: There is an edge-of-theseat intensity to every note they pro
duce. Or The San Francisco 
Examiners critique: Its been 
decades since this country has pro
duced a chamber music organization with this much passion. 
Perhaps the attendees knew that the 
trio had won the prestigious 1991 
Naumburg Award or that their first 
album won National Public Radios
There is an edgeof-the-seat intensity 
to every note they 
produce.
- The New York 
Times
. Best Debut Album of the Year award 
in 1998. Or perhaps they just hap
pened to be in the store at the time. 
In any case, they were not disap
pointed.
Individually the women of the 
Eroica Trio are talented, and togeth
er they are astounding. 
Internationally acclaimed Sara 
SantAmbrogio plays the cello. 
Coming from a family with a 600- 
year music history, she does not dis
appoint. Her style and technique are 
technical perfection. She clearly 
loves to play and her music reflects 
it. Violinist Adela Penas playing 
serves as a nice complement to 
Saras cello. Adela began playing at 
the age of four. With her incredible 
passion and technical precision, it is 
no surprise that she began winning 
prestigious awards as a young 
teenager. Finally, there is Erika 
Nickrenz on piano. She is the glue 
that holds the pieces together. Her 
incredibly sharp play keeps the

retailers that may include such 
names as Tiffanys, FAO Schwarz, 
and J. Crew, though none of these 
companies has signed a lease yet.
National restaurants are also like
ly to sign on if the redevelopment 
plan goes through. This means that 
upscale chain restaurants like 
California Pizza Kitchen may take 
the place of independent businesses 
like Mama Lucia downtown on 433 
Wood St.
The chain stores, they have the 
same thing over and over, said 
Behrooz Rahimzadeh, the owner of 
Mama Lucias since 1982, and an 
employee at the pizza shop since its 
opening in 1975. But I make things 
the way you like it. If you dont like 
it this way, I dont have to make it 
that way. If you want it spicy, Ill 
make it spicy. You know, the way 
you like it.
The reason that you may not have 
heard of Mama Lucias, despite their 
commitment to made-to-order per
fection, is that Rahimzadeh claims 
that he spends almost no money on 
advertising, because of the strong 
word of mouth about the restaurant 
and the repeated return of loyal cus
tomers.
I have people who came here 
with their moms and dads, and now 
theyre grown up and theyre work
ing and theyre still coming here, 
he said.
Rahimzadeh said that he has been
a member of the Pittsburgh commu
nity since he came to this country at 
age 15, in search of The American 
Dream. He started down the path 
towards that dream by attending 
California University of 
Pennsylvania and graduating from 
their computer program. Then, 
when he felt that he was ready to go 
into business for himself, he bought 
out the owners of the pizza compa
ny where he had been working for 
faithfully for seven years.
It is a story that sounds quite 
familiar to Scott Zerbe, the owner of 
Alvins Jewelers on 302 Forbes Ave. 
After working at Alvins for 15 years, 
he bought the store from his father 
six years ago. His father had pur
chased the store 40 years earlier 
from Alvin himself, who first set up 
shop in 1932.
Zerbe claims that Alvins is the 
only place to get watches and clocks 
repaired in downtown Pittsburgh. 
He also says that there are some 
jewelers closer to campus who can 
fix these items but, They cant give 
you the service that I can. Because I 
do everything on the premises. 
Where they send it out. So, if you 
wanted something done, repaired 
fairly quick, it would benefit you to 
come here.
Alvins has the additional distinc
tion of being the oldest store 
between Grant and Market Streets

You come home from school one 
day to discover a letter from the 
University. You read in disbelief as it 
tells you that the administration has 
decided that Carnegie Mellon 
University is not attracting the type 
of students that it wants to be 
attracting, and therefore is going to 
be razed and reconstructed. In other 
words, the school where you have 
worked hard in your classes, where 
you have formed ties with your 
friends and teachers, where you 
have invested so much of your 
money and time, will be gone. The 
University apologizes for the incon
venience, and is happy to help you 
relocate to Community College of 
Allegheny County, where they have 
a seat reserved for you. You will 
have to start over as a freshman, 
theyre afraid. Sorry, they say, but 
its for the greater good.
Inconceivable, right? Wrong. This 
seemingly ridiculous scenario may 
become fact for many small busi
nesses downtown on Fifth and 
Forbes Avenue and in Market 
Square. These buildings may be 
demolished and businesses relocat
ed against their will to make way for 
Market Place at Fifth and Forbes, a

DOWNTOWN, from page LI 
downtown. In fact, Alvins is one of 
65 such buildings in the downtown 
area which was nominated for his
toric designation by City 
Councilman Jim Ferlo last week in 
an attempt to slow down Mayor 
Murphys Fifth & Forbes redevelop
ment plan.
First announced last October, 
Murphys plan calls for the acquisi
tion and razing of 62 of 64 buildings 
along Forbes Avenue downtown, in 
addition to 23 others within the 
Market Square historic district. If 
they are not deemed historically sig
nificant, both Mama Lucias and 
Alvins Jewelers will be relocated 
in order to make way for these 
plans. Neither Rahimzadeh nor 
Zerbe want to leave the locations 
that they have worked at for so 
many years, but Mayor Murphy has 
stated that he will use his right of 
eminent domain in order to move 
these businesses.
Other longstanding Pittsburgh 
stores will also be affected. One 
such store is Candy-Rama, which 
has been housed at its Forbes loca
tion for 23 years, according to assis
tant manager Diana Jones.
Candy-Rama not only sells the 
types of nationally distributed

candy bars that are available in 
many locations, but also has an 
enormous and well-varied cheap 
bulk candy section where students 
can purchase the same toffees and 
jellybeans that were once common 
in drug stores everywhere, but are 
now rarely found in stores that sell 
name-brand candy.
We have candies, said Jones, 
that when I was a little girl, they 
were the same candies. So, I think 
thats unique'and I also think thats 
exciting.
As one of Joness co-workers rang 
up a purchase for a mother and her 
excited son, she added, It hasnt 
changed in 20 years.
Alumni offer students slice of working life
Fr ClaI 76o1veaud
Acting Arts & Living Editor
How do I make my money last? 
What do I need to know for inter
views? Should I take this job or 
keep looking for another?
If you are like most students, 
you may not be sure whether or 
not to continue on to graduate 
school or to enter the work force. 
The Slice of Life 2000 Conference 
on February 5th, sponsored by 
Student Alumni Relations 
Council and the Career Center, 
seeks to provide students with 
options.
We work to bring back alumni 
from various backgrounds and 
experiences to present on topics 
that will help students once they get 
out there on their own. For exam
ple, this year we have topics ranging
from Investing for Beginners to 
Youre Hired! Now What?, said 
Joanna Peters, a senior philosophy 
major, who has worked to organize 
the Februrary 5th program.
Students can choose from eight 
programs.  Considering Graduate 
School will give students a chance 
to hear employers perspectives on 
graduate school. Investing 101 
will help explain the basics of 
investing.
The program Networking will 
help students recognize network
ing opportunits and network 
effectively to professionals. Other 
programs include 7 Secrets of 
Sucessful People, Stretching 
your Paycheck in which students 
will learn effective budget manag
ing tips, So You Want to Start 
Your Own Business, where stu
dents will learn to decide what it 
takes to be able to start their own
business, Working Women, 
where issues that women face in 
the workplace will be covered, and 
Youre Hired! Now What? where 
students will learn to navigate 
office politics.
Ive been interested in doing 
graduate work and several of these 
programs look like theyd be pretty 
helpful, said senior history major 
Scott Crowder.
To register, students must sign up 
online at http://www.andrew. 
cmu.edu/~sarc by February 2.
The SARC works to strengthen 
ties between students and alumni.
The topics are intended to give 
students an idea of what it will be 
like their first year on the job, and 
how to deal with different issues 
that may come up. Even more, it is 
supposed to make them aware of 
the different resources that exist, 
Peters said.
Eroica trio performs passionately
TRIO, from page LI 
pieces from flying apart. Her 
work makes the total more than 
the sum of its parts.
The talented trio dares to 
take on the works of both clas
sical and 20th century com
posers, and conquers them all. 
Whether playing Bach, Vivaldi, 
or Gershwin, the trio shines. 
They avoid the trap of playing a 
piece like it ought to be 
played (translation: the trite, 
boring way), instead of playing 
it how they want. The result is 
work that is both passionate 
and unique, yet maintains the
beauty of the composers 
arrangement.
Tonights concert will fea
ture works by Gershwin, Ravel, 
and Dvorak. In addition to the 
talented trio, tonights perfor
mance will feature two mem
bers of the Carnegie Mellon 
staff: flutist Jeanne Baxtresser 
and mezzo-soprano Mimi 
Lerner. The combined talents 
should make for an excellent 
show and a good time for all. 
The show is highly recommend
ed for anyone even slightly 
interested in the modern cham
ber music scene.

50 YEARS AGO
January 17, 1950  A coin toss deter
mined who would win a position in the 
Margaret Morrison Student Council, due to 
a tie vote.
Voter turnout was up this year due in 
part to a new system involving two-day 
elections. During their previous session, 
the Student Council decided to add a vot
ing session on Wednesday. They said that 
adding the extra day would allow stu
dents who did not have classes on the typ
ical Tuesday voting day to participate in 
the elections. The extra day of voting 
proved useful, with about 40 percent of 
ballots cast on Wednesday.
25 YEARS AGO
January 28, 1975  Food Services antici
pated a $35,000 to $40,000 loss after 340 
students broke their food contracts. These 
decisions were attributed in part to the econ
omy and in part to growing dissatisfaction 
with Food Services. Students complained 
that the food on campus lacked variety and 
was not appetizing. They also said that eat
ing at their dorms or fraternity houses was a 
cheaper and more nutritious alternative and 
that the dining hours on campus were too 
limited.
10 YEARS AGO
January 30, 1990  The CMU Womens
Center opened this week to provide support 
and unity to women on campus. With a ratio 
of three Women to seven men at CMU, the 
Centers goal was to help women realize the 
opportunities they had and learn to cope 
with the male-dominated environment.
The problems women faced on campus 
included feeling intimidated in class, which 
made them reluctant to participate. Located 
in Margaret Morrison Plaza, the center was 
to be used for support services during the 
day and as Morrisons Lounge at night.
FIVE YEARS AGO
January 30, 1995  A vote to impeach 
Student Body President Declan McCullagh
failed to reach the necessary two-thirds vote. 
McCullagh was under question for financial 
misconduct as well as harassment. 
Immediately after the vote, Student Body 
Treasurer Emma Gosden froze McCullaghs 
budget, which was running a deficit. Many 
felt that that McCullagh, who took out an 
American Express Corporate Card, was inap
propriately spending students money. It was 
estimated that he spent $450 on phone calls 
and $270 on dinners with unspecified indi
viduals.
ONE YEAR AGO
February 1, 1999  Housing. Services 
announced that new electronic locks would
be placed in all CMU-owned residence halls. 
The new lock would feature an electronic 
keycard entry system and a numbered key 
card.
This decision by Housing Services came 
after several master keys were lost the pre
vious August. Director of Housing Services 
Tim Michael said this alternative would 
provide an easy way to deal with the prob
lems associated with lost keys. The new sys
tem would allow for the easy replacement 
of key cards and the re-keying of electronic 
locks.

AT&T Trims the fat
PITTSBURGH (AP) AT&T Corp. is 
cutting 173 jobs from a business 
billing operation in Pittsburgh as 
part of the company's ongoing 
efforts to slash $2 billion in operat
ing costs this year.
AT&T has hired about 300 people 
in the Pittsburgh area as cable 
installers and customer service rep
resentatives since last year's acquisi
tion of Tele-Communications Inc., 
the dominant cable system operator 
in Western Pennsylvania.
AT&T plans to add 400 more jobs 
to that operation this year, and also 
recently hired 300 people for a new 
call center in Pittsburgh.
British drug

LONDON(AP) Drug makers Glaxo

the world's largest pharmaceutical 
company, with products from 
Aquafresh toothpaste to NicoDerm 
smoking cessation products.
SK Beecham urged its 9,000 
Pennsylvania employees Monday to 
be patient as they await word on the 
impact of the company's merger 
with Glaxo Wellcome on individual 
jobs and departments.
SmithKline employs 2,000 work
ers at Philadelphia headquarters as 
well as 2,800 at two research opera

consumer health care business in 
Pittsburgh and several hundred

Amazon drowns 
150 employees
SEATTLE(AP) Internet retailing 
giant Amazon.com, a trend setter 
since it went online in 1995, has 
announced another first: layoffs.
The company, which added more 
than 5,000 workers to its payroll last 
year, said it will layoff about 150 
workers.
News of the layoffs helped send 
the company's shares down $5.25 to 
$61.68 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market on Friday. Those shares are 
now down 42 percent from their 
mid-December peak of more than 
$106 per share.
Despite the market declines 
Friday, analysts were bullish on 
Amazons decision to pare back its 
payroll.
Said Tom Wyman, an analyst with 
J.P. Morgan, I consider this a very 
positive sign that this management 
team is prepared to make the tough 
decisions.

The Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration is moving up in the 
world. With current construction 
that includes adding a new floor on 
the roof of Posner Hall, the school 
hopes to build on its already strong 
reputation in business education 
and research, according to GSIA 
Dean Douglas Dunn.
There will be a tiered classroom 
for executive education, a lounge, a 
multi-purpose conference/meet
ing/social space at the front of the 
new floor, other conference rooms, 
faculty offices, and a work process
ing space for administrative activi
ties," said Paul Tellers, University 
Architect of Facility Management 
Services.
Tellers also said that the offices 
for the Carnegie Bosch Institute 
(CBI), which are currently located 
in various locations throughout the 
building, would be consolidated on 
the new floor.
Business education will be 
expanded and enhanced by having 
more space for the CBI to allow its 
new programs to develop and grow.

In what is being hailed as the most 
crucial aspect of Renaissance Three, 
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphys 
Marketplace at Fifth and Forbes has 
created a hotbed of controversy 
involving preservationists, down
town business owners, politicians, 
and fiscal conservatives. Although 
both sides stress the cultural and his
torical relevance of the project, the 
financial aspects of the project have 
been shielded from the spotlight in 
the developments controversy.
The Fifth and Forbes Avenues cor
ridor in downtown Pittsburgh has 
been slated as a redevelopment area. 
Proponents of Mayor Murphys 
Marketplace and those with alter
nate plans all agree that the once 
proud retail district of Pittsburgh is in 
need of an overhaul. However, the 
disagreements lie in the approach.
Murphys creation calls for the 
demolition of 62 structures, while 
preserving the facades of approxi
mately 12 buildings. He hopes to 
add upscale retailers, such as 
Tiffanys and J. Crew. Marketplace 
also includes the construction of an 
AMC Entertainment 18-screen 
megaplex, complete with an 
underground parking facility.
Current merchants would be 
relocated while the current build
ings are razed. Their participation 
in the reestablished retail corridor 
is somewhat dubious as 
Marketplace continues to evolve.
Mayor Murphys plan will for
mally be announced to council in 
February, but battle lines have 
already been drawn. The 
Pittsburgh History and Landmarks 
Foundation (PHLF), a local agency 
committed to historic preservation
work, plans to reveal their own 
plan February 2.
The Mayors proposal is estimat
ed to cost between $480 and $500 
million. A substantial majority of 
the monies would come from the 
investment of Urban Retail 
Properties, the company responsi
ble for Marketplaces development. 
Approximately ten percent of the 
project would be funded from tax 
increment financing (TIF). In 
recent years, the city has allocated 
TIFs for the construction of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates new baseball 
park, the Steelers and University of 
Pittsburghs new football stadium, 
and new banking operations cen
ters for both Mellon Financial and 
PNC Corporation, among other 
projects. Tax increment financing 
allows tax revenues generated from 
a new facility in a definite time 
frame to go toward the payment of 
its construction.
In addition to TIFs, Governor 
Tom Ridge has budgeted an unde
termined amount from the com
monwealth toward the Fifth and 
Forbes retail project. Under the 
Mayors idea, the Pittsburgh 
Development Fund, a city-subsi
dized account whose importance 
was called into question at recent 
council budget discussions, would 
apportion $10 million to the pro
ject. Another $10 million would be 
donated by the Strategic
Investment Fund, a trust created 
five years ago by local corporate 
executives in response to the 
Pittsburgh Development Fund.
Of the projects $480 million price 
tag, the Urban Redevelopment 
Authority would handle the site 
preparation work. The preliminary 
site work includes property acquisi
tion and demolition. It is estimated 
to cost $78 million. However, many
2lrou zo6vouW Ai&V& CeaV&l
critics contend this cost will rise 
considerably if the city is forced into 
an eminent domain court battle. 
One past example is the Pittsburgh 
Wool Company and Heinz Company 
fight. Land owned by Pittsburgh 
Wool estimated at $1 million went 
for $5 million. Pittsburgh Wool had 
threatened a legal battle if eminent 
domain was used to obtain their 
property for development of Heinzs 
expansion on the North Side.
Although many project observers 
cite the obvious similarities 
between the PHLF and Mayors 
plan, both contain financial and 
tactical differences. PHLFs project 
calls for the Main Street approach, 
an idea incorporated in Pittsburghs 
historic South Side/Carson Street 
district. The Main Street idea 
emphasizes incremental redevelop
ment rather than complete recon
struction. The style aims to incor
porate building owners participa
tion through a centralized develop
er and post-construction controller, 
rather than the Mayors proposal, 
which calls for property ownership 
through a third party (Urban Retail 
Properties). It also tries to appeal 
to building owners capitalist inter
ests. Although the exact details are 
still being determined, existing 
owners would be able to receive 
stock options through a consortium 
for their involvement in the project. 
Additionally, owners are not forced 
into redevelopment of their struc
tures, but are also offered faade 
renovation grants. Nevertheless, 
the PHLF strategy does arrange the 
demolition of 34 structures.
Additionally, the project devel
oper of the PHLF Marketplace 
would receive $28 million in tax 
credit. The developer would then 
be able to apportion those credits 
as they saw fit.
One obvious risk the Main Street 
plan allows for is that some tenants 
may refuse to agree to partake in the 
project. Cathy Boroucek, Executive 
Assistant to the President of PHLF, 
said two options are available in this 
situation. Owners can wait until a 
tenants lease expires and then 
bring in a new occupant or allow the 
tenant to mix with the flavor of the 
other merchants. The PHLF plan 
hopes to allow time and change to 
run its course within the redevelop
ment, instead of a full-scale corridor 
modernization.
Other more dubious economic 
components that need to be consid
ered are the consumers of the Fifth 
and Forbes retail district. Although 
business owners maintain their vari
eties and local flavors are what 
attracts shoppers, the Mayors office 
emphasizes the need to appeal to the 
majority of workers who are in 
downtown five days a week, but do 
not shop there. Additionally, all 
sides agree that the downtown 
neighborhood needs to create a new 
market segment: downtown resi
dents. Although Marketplace does 
not call for new downtown housing 
developments, Craig Kwiecinski, 
Mayors office spokesman, said that 
the dty will work hard to ensure 
downtown housing and specifically 
cited potential developments in the 
cultural district, north shore, and 
along First Avenue. The PHLF plan 
does include concessions for new 
Golden Triangle housing.
Despite the noticeable dispari
ties between the Mayors plan and 
alternative submittals, there is a 
great deal of discussion which 
must occur. The Mayor has been 
very open to compromise and this

will continue to undergo public 
scrutiny.
The buildings shown at the cor
ner at Wood Street and Forbes 
Avenue are slated for demolition 
under the Mayors Marketplace 
project. Throughout the years, the 
structures have undergone numer
ous facade changes to relate to the 
time period. The City News 
Arcade facade is actually part of 
one building, which includes the 
next two towers, although they 
have undergone considerable alter
ations.
If one compares photographs of 
this corner versus those of 50 years 
ago, one can easily notice that foot 
traffic has considerably subsided.

Posner Hall addition will 
create needed space
gl&s 07j.B 6od9 36 
For example, [the CBI will make 
use of the] new classroom for exec
utive education, a new studio for 
long distance collaboration and 
additional space for visitors and 
collaborators, added Dunn.
The CBI, one of GSIAs research 
centers, focuses primarily on issues 
pertaining to international man
agement. Dunn said he expects the 
new space will also facilitate the 
work of a number of the schools 
other interdisciplinary research 
centers. Stressing the importance 
of research at GSIA, Dunn said 
three major areas on which the 
school will be concentrating are 
information technology, the glob
alization of business, and entrepre
neurship.
Dunn added that the new space 
would also allow faculty to collab
orate more effectively on research 
projects. While emphasizing the 
importance of group work in the 
business world, Dunn said that 
the meeting rooms would 
enhance information sharing and 
help students work together to 
solve problems.
According to Tellers, the plan to 
add the additional floor was part of 
the original design of Posner Hall, 
which was built in the early 1990s 
as a major part of the 1987 master 
plan. Hence, the roof of the build
ing was constructed as a floor with 
roofing added on top. Last sum
mer, the roofing was removed and 
work began to extend the current 
columns to support the addition.
The current construction project 
will also create a new link between 
the second floor faculty offices of 
Posner Hall and the older part of 
GSIA. In addition, a student 
lounge will be added next to the 
circulation path between the two 
buildings.
Tellers expects the construction, 
which started last July, to be com
pleted in July 2000. Individuals 
will move in the following month 
and the facility will be ready for 
use in time for the fall semester.
During the course of this pro
ject, those working in GSIA have 
been subject to some inconve
niences associated with the con
struction.
There are intermittent utility 
shutdowns and noise during the 
construction process. The stairs 
and elevator have to be extended 
and this temporarily disrupts the 
adjacent area on the existing sec
ond floor. The link tie-in disrupts 
the second floor and the confer
ence room on the first floor below, 
said Tellers, adding that the con
struction manager, project manag
er, and GSIA administrative staff 
work together to coordinate these 
activities.
However, few can disagree 
that the changes at GSIA will 
only improve its reputation as a 
national leader in the business 
world. The affects of the struc
tural changes will allow it to 
facilitate its ability to be an inno
vator and creator in the world of 
business administration.

The Association of Industrial 
Management and Economics, a stu
dent body of business and econom
ics students, recently held elections 
for the new executive board. Junior 
business administration student 
Jessey Paul replaced Stephanie 
Yang, the former president. Other 
elected officials include 
Administrative Director Katy Harris, 
Finance Director Angira Apte, and 
Activities Director Vishal 
Radhakrishnan.
The new AIME officers said they 
are very excited to enhance the 
clubs value in the areas of acade
mic benefit, social functions, and 
career-related services. In addi
tion to these new possibilities, 
Paul optimistically cited her hope 
that the AIME, an organization 
most closely recognized with the 
Business Opportunities
Conference, would be' looked 
upon by business and economics 
students as a forum for their con
cerns.
However, the boards current 
and foremost objective is to create 
a greater awareness of AIMEs 
potential to be an outlet for busi
ness administration and econom
ics students, said Harris.
The executive board has already 
brainstormed some preliminary 
goals. They wish to be able to 
cosponsor several career advisory 
events and work closely with several 
established business organizations
We want AIME

However, the board is currently 
working out more details about 
the groups functions. 
Additionally, they hope to make 
their new web site available in the 
next couple of weeks.
GM opens 
new factory
PONTIAC, Mich. (AP)  The 
$560 million factory that General 
Motors Corp. will build in Lansing 
isnt just another assembly plant, but 
a dissertation on six years of lessons 
learned the hard way.
The Lansing Grand River 
Assembly Plant, plans for which 
were are to be unveiled today is part 
of GM's attempt to shed its reputa
tion for bloated, old-school manu
facturing and prove it can build 
vehicles as efficiently as any other 
automaker in the world.
Here are three of those lessons, 
and how the world's largest 
automaker plans to put them to 
use.
LESSON NO. 1: Work with work
ers, not against them. Since a 1998 
strike, GM has been trying to rebuild 
its relationship with the UAW, who 
have been involved from the start in 
planning the new plant, and that 
one of the guiding principles for its 
design was taking care of the work
er.
LESSON NO. 2: There's no shame 
in taking ideas from the best. When 
GM decided to improve its manufac
turing process in 1994, one of its 
first moves was to import talent 
from Toyota, and to study the pro
duction lines at the California facto
ry the two automakers run together.
LESSON NO. 3: The future's never 
certain. GM officials said making 
the plant as variable as possible was 
one of the keys to helping GM com
pete. The plant was also designed to 
be friendly to the idea of build-toorder systems.
Japanese Economists hope for weaker yen
TOKYO (AP)  Major industrial 
nations should work together to 
steady foreign exchange rates, the 
head of Japan's Economic Planning 
Agency said in advance of a week
end meeting of key finance minis
ters and central bankers.
It's extremely important to coop
erate toward stable foreign 
exchange and reduce the size of. 
fluctuations," Taichi Sakaiya said 
Tuesday.'
Finance ministers and central 
bankers of the Group of Seven 
nations, known as G-7, are sched
uled to meet in Tokyo on 
SaturddayiKiichi Miyazawa, Japan's 
finance minister, said he expected 
the yen's strength to be a topic of 
discussion, but refused to predict an 
outcome.
Japanese leaders are worried that 
the strong yen will scuttle a recov
ery from the longest recession since 
World War II.
The yen's performance is especial
ly important to exporters, the 
strongest sector of Japan's economy. 
A stronger yen hurts them by mak
ing their goods more expensive 
overseas, cutting profits.
In September, G-7 ministers said 
they shared Japan's concern about 
the yen's strength and its effect on 
the Japanese and world economies.
In November, the yen climbed 
to levels last seen in 1995. While 
it has weakened somewhat 
recently, the yen remains strong.
The Bank of Japan has repeatedly 
intervened in the currency market 
since late last year to buy dollars in 
attempts to stem the yen's rise.
Miyazawa said he did not think 
the G-7's perception about foreign 
exchange rates has changed much 
from the last meeting in September.
Miyazawa also said regulation of 
global e-commerce might be anoth
er topic at the G-7 meeting, but indi
cated discussion of candidates for 
managing director of the
International Monetary Fund will 
likely be kept to the sidelines.
The G-7 won't discuss the 
issue at the meeting itself. But it 
will be talked about at unofficial 
occasions such as dinners, he 
said.
Japan's former vice-finance min
ister for international affairs at the 
Ministry of Finance, Eisuke 
Sakakibara, has been proposed as a 
possible candidate to take the place 
of IMF chief Michel Camdessus, 
who steps down next month.
Other topics on the G-7 agenda 
are the involvement of the private 
sector in crisis management and 
implementation of debt-relief initia
tives for the world's poorest nations.
The G-7  made up of the 
United States, Japan, Germany, 
Britain, Italy, Canada and France 
will also exchange views on 
Russia's economy with the 
Russian representative to the 
group.
Bank chief confident with future of euro
LONDON (AP)  Despite the 
euro hitting record lows against the 
dollar, European Central Bank chief 
Wim Duisenberg said Sunday he is 
satisfied with the performance of 
Europe's single currency because it 
has delivered stable prices.
Our main purpose is to deliver a 
climate of stable prices, and that is 
what we have done, and what we 
have achieved, Duisenberg said in a 
British Broadcasting Corp. televi
sion interview.
That the exchange rate has fallen 
somewhat is of course of much less 
significance now, for the euro area 
in total, than it was in the past for 
the individual countries because 
foreign trade, imports or exports, 
only represents about 16 to 17 per
cent of the euro area GDP, he 
added.
The euro has fallen 14 percent 
against the dollar since it was adopt
ed by 11 of the 15 member-nations 
of the European Union, including
France and Germany, in January 
last year.
On Friday, the euro hit 97.62 
cents, slumping to a record low for 
the second straight day after 
stronger than expected economic 
growth was reported in the United 
States.
Duisenberg said that compared 
with 1997-98, the euro had only 
fallen 5 or 6 percent against the dol
lar and that was because Europe 
was emerging from recession while 
U.S. growth continued at a surpris
ingly fast pace.
The divergence in economic 
development is already disap
pearing and it will disappear 
totally, in our expectation. And 
then the euro will show its 
strength, said Duisenberg. We 
do believe, we honestly believe, 
that the euro has a potential to 
increase its value.
French Finance Minister Christian 
Sautter said Saturday he hopes cur
rency markets will soon take notice 
of economic recovery in the 11 
countries that have switched to the 
euro.
That performance isnt perceived 
sufficiently, he told executives and 
politicians gathered here.
Sooner or later, it should return 
to a level that is compatible with the 
strength of the euro zone, Sautter 
said.
Duisenberg said British member
ship of the euro was years away 
because of differences between the 
British and continental European 
economies.
I mean if ever the United 
Kingdom were to decide to join, you 
are talking about a moment in time 
which is years from today, said 
Duisenberg.
He said he believed it would be 
in Britains interests to adopt the 
euro, but it is up to the people of 
Britain to come to the same con
clusion.

Not all movies triumphed in 1999
Fr 0l9d b&ga
Entertainment Editor
February is here which means only one thing 
for movie buffs: the Academy Award nomina
tions. Thats right, time to hand out the Oscars. 
This year, the nomination ballots are due back to 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences on Friday, February 5. The nominations 
will be announced on Tuesday, February 15.
And finally, the 72nd Academy Awards will 
take place on Sunday, March 26.
However, you probably wont see a lot of the 
movies and personalities mentioned in this arti
cle on the winners list. The top contenders for 
the Academy Awards will be discussed in next 
weeks issue. This week, we are going to take a 
look at the bottom of the barrel. These are the 
nominations for the Abademy Awards, honor
ing the worst movies and acting of the year. Also, 
since this is a fictitious award, there is no awards 
ceremony. Thus, the winner will also be chosen.
Worst Actor
Nominees: Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Chill Factor),
I Chris ODonnell (The Bachelor), Lou Diamond 
Phillips (Bats), Jean-Claude Van Damme 
(Universal Soldier.The Return)
Winner: Its a close race, but the winner is Van 
Damme. While the skillful Gooding and Phillips 
deserve an award for a poor choice of movie to 
be in, they just dont have what it takes to com
pete with Van Damme and ODonnell. But in a 
decision that may stir some controversy, 
ODonnell is a slightly better actor. Thus, Van 
Damme wins the Abademy.
After all, Van Damme is the guy who makes 
directors scared of shooting films in the United 
States because of lawsuits. This was best evi
denced when he more-or-less accidentally 
gouged an extra in the eye during a swordfighting scene while filming Cyborg.
Worst Actress
Nominees: Melissa Joan Hart ([Drive Me 
Crazy), Rose McGowan (,Jawbreaker), Elisabeth 
Shue (Molly), Rene Zellweger (The Bachelor)
Winner: Zellweger, whose name isnt the only 
thing at the bottom of the barrel. Hart and 
McGowan are the major contenders in this cate
gory as they appear in teenage-angst movies.
P 549uVa9Vi E9uV1lr T&-
Drive Me Crazy aS &u9 &g Vi9 1ug&lV1uoV9 v9oeaud I&uV9ue9lS g&l Vi9 hbademy .4ole g&l '&lSV L&xa9,
However, they can always blame the bad screen
play. The same goes for the veteran Shue who 
probably just needed the money and chose the 
wrong movie.
Therefore, the award goes to Zellweger who 
makes many wonder if her performance in Jerry 
McGuire was a fluke. Its clear that Jewel lookalike appearance is probably the reason why 
shes so popular. You had me at hello, wasnt 
the most memorable phrase of that movie. (It is 
ironic that Gooding, the actor who had the best 
Jerry McGuire line, is also nominated for an 
Abademy Award. Perhaps he should have said, 
Show me the money! in Chill Factor.)
Worst Movie
Nominees: Brokedown Palace, Drive Me Crazy, 
My Favorite Martian, Pokemon: The First Movie
Winner: Before the winner is announced, it 
should be said that this is a tough one. My
Favorite Martian was totally lost on the 1999 
crowd. Do you know anyone who actually saw 
Brokedown Palace? And with all the money that 
Pokemon is bringing in, youd think the film 
would be somewhat decent.
But the winner is Drive Me Crazy. In a year 
where many mainstream movies have been suc
cessful for their creativity (Being John Malkovich, 
Magnolia), this movie is perhaps the most uno
riginal movie of the decade. Popular cheerleader 
girl lives next door to young, grungy hippie. 
Cheerleader has nothing in common with hip
pie. Guess what? They fall in love!
Even Melissa Joan Hart, who plays Sabrina on 
Sabrina The Teenage Witch and opened so many 
eyes this year with her scantily-clad pictures, 
couldnt make this one fly.
Tune in next week for the leading contenders in 
the Academy Award race.
Horoscopes by Momo Starbuck
Momo Starbuck
Aquarius
(January 20 - February 18)
Happy birthday, blah blah blah. I 
hope that in honor of your big day 
you get sex, booze, money, and 
compliments. A prize  if you can 
guess the right orderthat adds up 
to one hell of a night with me.
Aquarius isnt really rocking my 
celestial world right now; Im sort of 
spent on you.
Pisces
(February 19 - March 20)
Who wants to be a millionaire? 
Who the hell doesnt? Maybe Im 
missing the point of that show but I 
thought there would be more inter
esting guests on, at least some that I 
recognized. I also thought that 
when you won, you chose a number 
between 1 and 186 and whoever in 
the audience had the number you 
guessed got a very nice prize, usual
ly some pots and pans or a DVD 
player. And usually when Kathy Lee 
isnt there, Rege has his lovely wife 
Joy fill in. Whats going on?
Aries
(March 21 - April 19)
Aries. Dairies. Fairies. Canaries. 
Hairy fairy you scary canary. I loved 
A1 Pacino in Glengarry. Hand me 
that knife so I can commit Hari-Kari. 
Isnt it fabulous how wonderfully 
clear everything seems? The world 
makes so much sense after tandem 
shots of Jack and NyQuil. Hot damn, 
Im a looker. Hoo-ah.
Taurus
(April 20 - May 20)
Dont make any snap decisions in 
the next week or so, because the 
outcome of your situation could be 
more grave than you imagined. You
could end up like Catherine ZetaJones, pregnant and soon to be mar
ried to a guy who looks like hes 
from her dads poker night, and 
soon unable to fit into anything but 
made-to-fit Versace gowns and Old 
Navy overalls. Of course, you may 
end up like Michael Douglas, in 
which case youre one lucky mofo. I 
dont know. Choose wisely, I guess.
Gemini
(May 21 - June 21)
Dont think that just because 
daddy says you can take over the 
family business after graduation 
that that is an open invitation to do 
nothing and mooch off your parents 
for the rest of your life. I mean look 
at Sofia Coppola. Shes the Melissa 
Rivers of the cinematic world and 
besides being a very unattractive 
girl, she has a hot superstar little 
number for a husband and a film at 
the Sundance festival. Well. I guess 
that whole daddy thing worked out 
for her after all. Forget what I said.
Cancer
(June 22 - July 22)
Well Cans, its getting toward that 
time when you need to start think
ing about what youre going to be 
doing when you leave this place, 
and I can sense some apprehension, 
confusion, and fear coming from 
you. Well, let me remind you of a 
few of the illustrious alumni that 
you have from this place. That 
famous TV guy Steven Bochco, the 
balding but still funny man Ted 
Danson, and one of my old friends 
from the factory days, Andy Warhol. 
If that isnt enough to inspire great
ness within you, Christina Aguilera 
turned being a trashy Pittsburgh 
tramp into criteria for international 
pop stardom. So if all else fails you, 
bleach your hair and wax your belly 
and shake that caboose all die way 
to TRL. Good Luck!
Leo
(July 23 - August 22)
Leo, Leo, Leo. Look around. 
Leaves are brown. Theres a patch of 
snow on the ground. Its a hazy 
shade of winter. Its the springtime 
of my life. Back in 87 when I toured
as Susanna Hoffss personal 
chanteuse, masseuse, and Jesus, I 
took those words to heart. They 
represented the hopes, dreams and 
fears of a strong young woman deal
ing with her demons. I really 
respected her. Until I learned that it 
was an old Simon and Garfunkel 
tune and then I cursed her and hit 
the road with Poison.
Virgo
(August 23 - September 22)
Virgie, this new year seems to 
have you feeling a little dazed. Let 
me shed some light on a mystery 
that I cracked last week at a Ladies 
Home Journal luncheon for Dr. 
Joyce Brothers, maybe itll give you 
a hand. Powdering your nose, con
trary to what Ive always thought, 
does not mean Tm meeting Grace 
Jones in the coat room for some 
blow, wanna party? or Ill be in the 
third stall with my garters on, lets 
rock and roll. I know, I know, that 
knocked me right on my ass, too. I 
waited in that bathr'oom for an 
hour, but Peter Jennings never 
showed. Hey, you learn something 
new everyday.
Libra
(September 23 - October 23)
Hey, now that all this millennial 
2000 crap is all over, how about cel
ebrating the ME-llennium Leebsie? 
Let me suggest a few self-indulgent 
celebratory thingamajigs that my 
new best friends Noni Ryder and 
Gwynnie showed me at our girls 
night out party that we threw after 
neither of them won jack at the 
Golden Globes. Crack open 25 or 30 
bottles of Cristal and bathe in it, eat 
an M&M (I know! They are so bad!), 
and then make prank calls to Ben 
Affleck and Christina Ricci, pre
tending to be Martin Scorseses sec
retary and say that Mr. Scorsese is 
such a fan of their work and would 
really like to offer them a role in his 
next movie. Oh, then hang up and 
laugh, laugh, laugh.
Scorpio
(October 24 - November 21)
For Christmas sake, Scorpie, 
youre embarrassing. You are the
sign of sex in the zodiac and what do 
you have to show for it? A finger 
cramp and a ton of late fees at West 
Coast video. This is ridiculous. 
Heres an idea; I learned it from 
Morgan Stewarts Coming Home, 
starring the wisecracking little hottie Jon Cryer and a young-ish Lynn 
Redgrave. Just run up to the boy 
and/or girl that you find appealing 
and kiss them sexy-like on the 
mouth. Say, just pretend youre my 
boyfriend, theyre following me, or 
something. Keep kissing till there 
are no more questions. Tongue will 
help. In the movie, they became 
boyfriend/girlfriend and took a 
shower together wearing rubber 
masks. Let me know how it goes.
Sagittarius
(November 22 - December 21)
Sags, dont fret, its just another 
manic Monday. Oh, dont you wish 
it was a Sunday? Thats my fun day, 
too. My I-dont-have-to-run-day. I 
decided to give Suzie another 
chance, and this is the song that 
once again spun me into Ms. Hoffss 
web of deception. I was so taken 
with the songs simple yet poignant 
lyrics; I felt like she really knew me, 
really knew the highs and lows of 
the nine to fiver. I was so taken with 
her. Then the ugly tambourine play
er told me that Prince had written 
the song and I cried.
Capricorn
(December 22 - January 19)
So now that youve finally rocked 
the Feria, so to speak, and gussied 
yourself up, I approve of this little 
winter game called snowboarding 
that youve taken to. From what I 
understand, its a wonderland of 
sexy dirty young boys with a pen
chant for THC and the punk rock 
music. Way to go; sounds like a 
fools paradise. In my day, the place 
to find hot and trashed boy toys was 
at any one of Andy Warhols parties. 
But be wary of the attractive men 
who offer to come along with you 
on these swinging excursions  
hes probably looking at the same 
cute boys. I learned that the hard 
way; I really thought that Halston 
was after me.

The Red Violin
Thursday, February 3
Before going any further, you should know that the real 
name of this movie is Le Violon Rouge. And yes, its French 
(Canadian) with English subtitles. But parts of the movie are 
in German and Italian and Mandarin. So this is a case where 
youre glad the movie has subtitles. Actually, I never under
stood why some people hate subtitles. Without them, how the 
hell are you supposed to know whats going on?
Anyway, this is a really remarkable film, since its narration 
is so unusual. It begins with an auction in Montreal where the 
item up for bid is a famous Nicolo Bussotti violin. The instru
ment happens to be red as well. Its at this point that you may 
be wondering, Why is the violin red? (Just work with me 
here.)
Well, the movie answers your question. You actually follow 
the history of this violin, from its creation in 17th century 
Italy, to where it becomes red in ... well... youll have to find 
out where and how it becomes red by watching the movie. But 
unlike another movie involving color (Soylent Green') that 
played on campus last semester, the red violin is not people.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
Bringing Out The Dead
Friday, February 4
Only a movie named The Wingspan of a European Swallow 
starring Ted Danson as the Brave Sir Robin could be a better 
suited title for this campus. (Dont try to think too hard about 
how Ted Danson fits into Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I 
just used him since hes a CMU alumnus.)
In this Martin Scorsese film, Nicolas Cage plays a 
Manhattan ambulance driver whos trying to do everything 
he can to get fired from his job. I want to repeat the ambu
lance in case youre still stuck in 1976, celebrating the 
nations bicentennial and thinking that Scorseses current 
movie is about a taxi driver.
Nevertheless, like Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver, Cage finds 
himself saying You talkin to me? quite a bit. Thats because 
he is seeing dead people that he wasnt able to save on previ
ous ambulance runs. If thats not enough to make you go 
crazy, then you mustve missed The Sixth Sense.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
Star Wars Episode I:
The Phantom Menace
Saturday, February 5
Awwww... Star Wars.
Nothing but Star Wars.
Give me those Star Wars.
Dont let them end.
Awwww... Star Wars.
If they should bar wars,
Please let those Star Wars ... stay.
And hey, how bout that nutty Star Wars bar?
Didyou see all those creatures in there?
And hey, Darth Vader with that black and evil mask.
Did he scare you as much as he scared meeeeee?
 Bill Murray (as Nick Winters)
At 10 pm, 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
The Story of Ricky
Sunday, February 6
What is this movie and why the hell would you want to see; 
it? Youll want to see the gore, of course. In fact, youve 
already seen some of the gore without even realizing it.1 
Remember the old Daily Show when Craig Kilborn was the 
host? Remember how you used to think he was funny until 
Jon Stewart took over and is amazingly better?
Anyway, one time Kilborn interviewed these guys who 
wrote a book about the best movies to watch when complete
ly stoned. They argued that this movie was among the best. 
They even brought clips of this movie. In fact, one of the clips 
was so good that it was used for the introduction to Five 
Questions, which was part of Kilborns celebrity interview. 
Basically, in the clip, you see a big guy who takes his two fists 
and crosses them through another (smaller) guys head. 
Naturally, the head exploded.
It is this type of cheesy yet glorious goriness that you wont 
want to miss out on.
At 8 pm, 10 pm, midnight
In McConomy Auditorium

As my supply of anime dipped

began to look for new things 
to obsess over. Web comics 
were too popular; online 
chat required too many 
social skills.

When I was at my most desperate, 
I happened across the site I 
knew would change my life forever: timecube.com.
There, I learned that the Earth 
actually has four time points, 
but more importantly, that I am 
stupid and evil but do not KNOW 
I am stupid and evil.
