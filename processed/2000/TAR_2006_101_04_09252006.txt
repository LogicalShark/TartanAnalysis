Why students 
choose to move 
off campus
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
Most students pay $5500 a 
year for a room on campus and 
take nothing away four years 
later. A few investment-minded 
Carnegie Mellon students, 
though, are looking to put their 
living space to work.
The lure of land ownership 
has a few students turning the 
college experience into a quick 
profit. Private bathroom and 
utilities included.
Pittsburgh real estate agents 
are reporting more parents buy
ing houses or condos for their 
college-age children, according 
to a September 17 article in the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.
Its more common this year 
than in the past, said Cliff 
Schultz, a manager of the How
ard Hanna real estate agency, in 
the Tribune-Review. [Parents] 
see the cost of housing go up at 
universities, and they say, I can 
make an investment and turn it 
around in four years and make 
a profit.
The proximity of hospitals 
and other universities to Carn
egie Mellons campus may make 
for a wise investment.
Its not inflated as other mar
kets, but the university area is 
above average for Pittsburgh, 
said Jeffrey Myers, an adjunct 
professor in the Tepper School 
of Business.
Its important to have that 
infrastructure in place.
Navigating Pittsburghs homeownership terrain comes with 
a set of risks, particularly for 
those in their late teens and 
early 20s.
I basically pay the bills, 
and it takes a lot of time to go 
through a lot of stuff yourself. 
You have to go through the com
panies and set everything up by 
yourself, said Angela Huang, 
a sophomore industrial design 
major.
Last year, Huang, who now 
lives in Shadyside, lived in New 
House. Overall, she is happy 
with her decision to move be
cause of the space her Shadyside condo affords compared to

As their friends prepared to 
go out to parties the night of 
Saturday, September 16, Timi 
Abimbola and Megan Larcom, 
two first-year students, boarded 
a bus for the Big Apple. The trip 
resulted in a front-page photo in 
The New York Times.
Abimbola and Larcom traveled 
to New York City to participate in 
a demonstration that was part of 
the global Day for Darfur.
Abimbola, a student in politi
cal science, international rela
tions, and French, said the jour
ney to New York was a whirlwind 
adventure.
David Rosenberg of the Pitts
burgh Darfur Emergency Coali
tion, a group with the Thomas 
Merton Center, organized two 
busloads of demonstrators from 
Pittsburgh. The group departed 
Pittsburgh late Saturday evening 
and returned early last Monday 
morning.
Abimbola and her roommate 
Larcom, a business student, 
marched in the demonstration 
with between 20,000 and 30,000 
others in Central Park Sunday.
Timi ended up pushing her 
way up to the front barrier, 
Larcom said, noting that many 
of the demonstrators were from 
Darfur.
In all of the excitement of the 
rally, Abimbola and Larcom inad
vertently got into position near a 
group of photographers standing 
near the barrier.
[I realized] no ones VIP here, 
so I just pushed my way to the 
front, said Abimbola.
A photo of the two amid ralliers 
graced the September 18 front 
page of The New York Times.
The accompanying article 
noted some of the most recent 
developments in the crisis in 
Darfur, the western region of Su
dan. Tens of thousands have been 
killed, the article stated, and 
more than 2 million people have 
been displaced from their homes. 
Conflict in Darfur began in 2003, 
when rebels began fighting the 
government. The situation has 
been deemed the worlds most 
serious humanitarian crisis.
Currently, the only peacekeep
ing force in Sudan is a group of 
7000 African Union troops 
whose mandate expires on 
September 30. Demonstrators 
around the world demanded a
mandate for a United Nations 
peacekeeping force in Darfur and 
support for the poorly equipped 
African Union troops.
The United Nations has recog
nized the situation in Darfur as 
genocide, but many do not fully 
understand the term.
A big misconception of geno
cide is there has to be a certain 
percentage of people killed be
fore an event is considered a 
genocide, said Jay Aronson, 
an assistant professor of history 
whose major fields of study are 
science, technology and society, 
and human rights.
The UN Genocide Treaty de
fines the term genocide as 
commission of any variety of acts 
with the intention to destroy, in 
whole or in part, a national, eth
nical, racial, or religious group. 
By those terms, genocide may ex
ist without anyone being killed.
Aronson also said that histori
cally the government does not 
get involved in strictly humani
tarian issues.
[The United States] has no 
direct national interest [in Dar
fur], so were not doing anything. 
Were standing by as Darfur 
continues to unfold, he said. If 
there was a genocide in Mexico
or Canada, we would probably 
get involved because wed see the 
refugees streaming across the 
border. Unless were directly involved, we tend not to intervene 
in genocide.

Shooting at Duquesne University injures five basketball players
Brittney Jones, a Duquesne 
sophomore, has been charged for 
allowing two armed men to enter 
the dance though she was aware 
that they were armed.
In fact, Jones had asked onduty police guards if they were 
patting down guests before enter
ing the dance.
One of the suspects began fir
ing on Academic Walk near Vickroy Hall and Duquesne Towers. 
About six to 12 shots were fired 
from a semiautomatic handgun, 
according to the Pittsburgh PostGazette.
The Pittsburgh Bureau of Po
lice has issued a statement that 
two Penn Hills residents, William 
Holmes and Brandon Baynes, 
both 18, have been arrested and 
charged with attempted homi
cide, aggravated assault, carrying 
a firearm without a license, and
 i
criminal conspiracy in the shoot
ing. The two men are suspected 
to be the gunmen.
Jones has also been arrested 
and charged with criminal con
spiracy. Jones is suspected of 
playing a key role in the incident 
and has been suspended from the 
university.
The three suspects will be ap
pearing for a preliminary hearing 
this week.
Ashaolu is currently hospital
ized in serious condition at Mercy 
Hospital. He was the most seri
ously injured victim, as one of two 
bullets fragmented and lodged in 
his head. According to The New 
York Times, he is now breathing 
without the support of a ventila
tor and is able to talk softly.

/ BrBradford Yankiver
This Sunday, the Pittsburgh TribuneReview carried columnist Eric Heyls 
editorial CMU burns in satire hell 
once again in response to readme's 
article Carnegie Mellon Builds New 
Hauschwitz Dormitory.
While readme was the primary target 
of the editorial, Heyl also took aim at 
our campus community as a whole: 
The CMU communitys collective 
memory about producing such tasteless 
material seems abysmally short. (Heyl 
refers to The Tartans atrocious 2004 
April Fools issue, called The Natrat, 
which included both racist and misogynistic material.)
The assertion that our community 
has forgotten the lessons of The Natrat 
reveals that Heyls familiarity with the 
Carnegie Mellon community is dismally 
shallow.
Heyls perspective is important, how
ever, because it represents that of the 
average, uninformed outsider, who 
 understandably  thinks less of our 
community for having read the New 
Hauschwitz article.
The New Hauschwitz article is 
dramatically insensitive. My stomach 
turned as I thought about my great
grandfather, an Italian anti-Nazi activ
ist in 1930s Germany, who died in a 
concentration camp.
That being said, readmes recent edi
torial decision does not reflect the sen
sibilities or the culture of the Carnegie 
Mellon community  the decision to 
publish the New Hauschwitz article 
involved just a few people.
This community carries forward the 
lessons of The Natrat, the Shabazz af
fair, the Abunima-Finklestein lectures, 
and other campus controversies in the 
way we approach violations of our stan
dards. That approach is to heal and to 
learn.
Our community has been deliberate 
in fostering a robust dialogue about 
sensitive issues like race and sexuality, 
especially for matriculating students. I 
can see how this has come to fruition 
since new first-years arrived this year: 
an ever-improving Orientation; oppor
tunities to develop as leaders in the 
Emerging Leaders program and Syzygy 
conference; and new student-created 
groups, such as CMU Fusion, that aim 
to help students become involved with 
the diversity of our community.
As weve faced numerous controver
sies in the past few years, one thing has 
remained constant: Carnegie Mellon 
affirms that its students should remain 
unrestricted in their endeavors.
Just as the University upholds the 
facultys academic freedom in the in
terest of intellectual growth and the 
creation of new knowledge, Carnegie 
Mellon allows its students to act as the 
autonomous adults that we are.
Occasional controversy is the risk we 
accept in return for great freedom.
Now it is readmes charge to learn 
and grow from its recent misstep, just 
as it was The Tartans responsibility 
to recover from the Natrat incident. 
And the community will help readme 
succeed, just as it helped The Tartan 
succeed.
The only challenge readme faces is 
making the choice to part from its rocky 
history. But I have much confidence. 
In the wake of his recent blunder, 
readme editor Chris Kier made the ad
mirable move of apologizing openly 
to the community. It should be noted 
that he submitted the apology to The 
Tartan for publication well before Eric 
Heyls counterproductive article hit the 
stands. Kier seems poised to take this 
chance to part ways with the destruc
tive editors of readmes past, and cre
ate a smart, sensible, and purposeful 
publication.
I have every confidence that our com
munity will continue on its path to 
becoming a stronger, more inclusive 
community. I only hope that observ
ers of our community  such as Eric 
Heyl  wont overlook this as they pass 
judgment.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 25, 2006
t
Campus mourns Professor Preston Coveys death
Preston Covey
Courtesy of www.jci.org
by Claire Morgenstern
Assistant News Editor
Associate professor of philoso
phy Preston Covey, esteemed 
scholar and husband of library 
faculty member Denise Troll 
Covey, died at home last Monday. 
He was 64.
Coveys contributions are wellingrained into the foundation 
of Carnegie Mellons College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
(H&SS), and will continue to of
fer students some of the innova
tive opportunities for which the 
college is best known.
He was the recipient of the 
Elliott Dunlap Smith Award for 
Teaching and Educational Ser
vice in 1983 based on his role in
creating the first core curriculum 
for H&SS. He also served as direc
tor of the philosophy program, in 
the Department of History and 
Philosophy from 1982 to 1985, 
and witnessed the induction of 
philosophy as a separate depart
ment in 1986.
Preston continued to throw 
his full energy into the concept 
of the new department and took 
major strides to develop centers 
that complemented both his own 
background in ethics and the uni
versitys mission in computation 
and technology, said philosophy 
professor Kevin Kelly, referring 
to the passion with which Covey 
engineered the philosophy de
partment. Covey hired Kelly in 
1985.
The students who knew him 
best were those whom he ad
vised in the ethics, history and 
public policy program, an inter
disciplinary major between the 
history and philosophy depart
ments that Covey helped design. 
The program is currently the 
philosophy departments most 
popular major.
If there is one thing that I 
think Preston will be remem
bered for, it is the profound way 
that he invested his time and en
ergy in so many of his students 
and advisees, said philosophy 
professor Alex London.
Through his research, Covey 
sought to make an active contri
bution to applied ethics educa
tion. From 1988 to 2005, Covey 
served as director of the Univer
sitys Center for the Advance
ment of Applied Ethics. This 
institution seeks to develop in
teractive media applications for 
bioethics, research ethics, and 
more recently, political philoso
phy, social choice theory, moral 
theory, and methodology.
The center will continue Cov
eys mission of enabling students 
to experience the process of ethi
cal judgment via interactive mul
timedia technology.
Covey had always been a 
forward-thinking proponent of 
applied ethics education. He was 
active in both the American Phil
osophical Association Commit
tee on Computing in Philosophy 
and the Center for the Design 
of Educational Computing at 
Carnegie Mellon from the late 
80s through the early 90s. 
From the early days of comput. ers, Covey was . able to. develop 
interactive devices to add an
other dimension to the teaching 
of ethics, conflict resolution, and 
aesthetics.
Coveys colleagues within the 
philosophy department,, many 
of whom had known him for his 
entire tenure at Carnegie Mellon, 
recalled his dynamic personality, 
sense of humor, and passion for 
his discipline and his students.
Preston was a man to whom
ethics meant going far beyond 
the theoretical, whether in 
teaching, in administration, in 
understanding the boundaries 
of lethal force, or in just being a 
true friend, said Dana S. Scott, a 
friend of Coveys since graduate 
school and professor emeritus of 
computer science, philosophy, 
and mathematical logic. Scott 
also described Coveys warmth 
to him when he joined the fac
ulty in the 80s.
Philosophy department head 
professor Richard Scheines re
called an eight-hour car trip from 
Pittsburgh to New York he and 
Covey took when the two were 
colleagues at the Center for De
sign of Educational Computing 
in 1987.
We spent a few hours talking 
ethics, a few talking educational 
computing, a few talking family 
.... It did not take long to figure 
out that he was one of those char
acters in life who cannot really 
be described, Scheines said.
There should be a special 
medal for Prestons energetic 
and creative support for his de
partment, colleagues, and stu
dents, Kelly said. Collegiality 
is far too pale a word to describe 
it.
The philosophy department 
is planning a memorial service 
for the campus community. The 
date and location have not yet 
been decided.
MBA degree doesnt always mean CEO position
by Alexander DiLeonardo
Junior Staffwriter
Is an undergraduate degree 
from an elite private college 
worth the cost? On September
18, Carol Hymowitz, a weekly 
columnist for The Wall Street 
Journal, posed this question in 
an article titled Any College 
Will Do.
In her article, Hymowitz sug
gested that an education from a 
top school may not be worth the 
work and expense associated 
with it.
While admitting that a col
lege degree is a necessity, she
cited Thomas Neff, chairman of 
recruitment firm Spencer Stuart, 
who shifts the perspective.
It's what youve accomplished 
that matters, not what you were 
doing at 21, Neff stated.
While recognizing Carnegie 
Mellon for its computer science 
graduates, Hymowitz called at
tention to where these graduates 
end up.
[M]ost CEOs of the biggest 
corporations didnt attend Ivy 
League or other highly selective 
colleges, she stated. They went 
to state universities, big and 
small, or to less-known private 
colleges.
Some Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and alumni stand 
in opposition to Hymowitzs ar
ticle.
Senior business major Anna 
Kao, with job offers from UBS 
and Citigroup, said the article 
does not deter her.
I feel like if I didnt come to 
CMU, my path would be way 
different and for the worse, she 
said.
Charlotte Adler, who gradu
ated from Carnegie Mellon in 
1978, believes the article is 
skewed. Adler, who left IBM after 
14 years on an executive track to 
start her own business, suspects 
that most top-school graduates 
do not stay in corporate America
long enough to rise to the ranks 
of CEO.
Most students from top 
schools like CMU are over
achievers. In order to rise in a 
large corporation, you have to 
wait and slowly step through the 
different levels, she said.
Drawing on her experience in 
entrepreneurship, Adler offered 
a personal perspective on the 
business world.
You work hard to build this 
company, but when you retire 
you get a handshake and a little 
bit of money, she said. With 
your own company, you get an

Campus News in Brief
readme withdraws controversial issue
Last week, Activities Boards 
weekly satire publication, 
readme, withdrew all its issues 
due to the content in its article 
Carnegie Mellon Builds New 
Hauschwitz Dormitory.
The article, which satirized 
Housing and Dining Services, 
made specific references to 
statistics and events of the 
Holocaust.
Good satire is difficult to 
write, said Liz Vaughan, the 
advisor for Activities Board. 
Students notified her of the 
article a few hours after read
mes distribution on Wednes
day. Peoples perspective as 
to whats okay to write about 
vary.
According to readmes edi
tor, junior Chris Kier, read
me s intent was never meant 
to mock or insult the Jewish 
community.
Kier also stated that in the 
future, articles that can be 
construed as overly offen
sive will be brought before 
all the readme staff and mem
bers of the community for re
view before being printed.
Taskforce would name official mascot
Last Wednesday, the Presi
dents Student Advisory Coun
cil (PSAC) proposed creating 
a Mascot Identity Task Force 
to select an official mascot 
and mascot graphic for Carn
egie Mellon.
As of now, there is no offi
cial mascot for the University, 
although traditionally, Carne
gie Mellon has used designs of 
a bagpiper, thistle, or Scottie 
dog as logos.
Andrew Douglas, a senior 
who sits on both PSAC and 
the Athletics Council, said the 
latter group seeks a mascot 
as a rallying point for Univer
sity athletics. We feel like a 
mascot achieves some of our 
biggest goals: a closer-knit 
athletics community and a 
higher profile for athletics on 
campus, he said.
Douglas said the Carnegie 
Clan first requested the initia
tive last year.
According to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Jennifer Church, 
past unofficial mascots at ath
letic events have included the 
Scottie Dog and the kilt-clad 
Piping Highlander.
If were going to move in 
the direction [of designating a 
mascot], it should be a broad 
campus discussion, Church 
said.

Students rally around Darfur
DARFUR, from A1
Several speakers at the rally 
provided graphic details of what 
is happening in Darfur, Larcom 
said. Speakers included a former 
slave and a reporter who had 
been held hostage while work
ing in the region. The rally in 
New York called for action.
The world must act now and 
it must do so now because time 
is not on our side, said former 
Secretary of State Madeline Al
bright at the New York rally.
Aronson offered a few solu
tions to the crisis. Among his 
ideas is creating a standing UN 
force which would participate 
in military action solely for
humanitarian purposes. Though 
such a force would work toward 
positive humanitarian change, 
a standing UN military force 
is unlikely to be created, he 
said.
I think that sometime in the 
future theres going to have to 
be a strong military reaction 
to genocide. At some time the 
international community is go
ing to have to react extremely 
strongly and say that this wont 
be tolerated, he said.
Standing in the sun for several 
hours, Abimbola and Larcom 
were physically drained after 
the rally. But it was rewarding, 
they said.
The rally was life-changing
for me, said Abimbola. We 
were dead by the end of the day, 
but it was so worth it.
Aronson was not sure. 
Activism is good, but we have 
to work towards fundamen
tal political change, he said. 
These kinds of after-the-fact 
rallies are nice, and they make 
us feel better, but Im not sure 
how much they do.
But Larcom was convinced. 
I think the opportunity to 
collect so many voices in one 
particular place at one time 
strengthens the message that 
were sending.
And its impacting the people 
in Darfur. Theyre seeing that 
they do have support.
Duquesne shooting hits home*
SHOOTING, from A1
is irj fair condition at Mercy Hos
pital. He has undergone surgery 
to repair a damaged artery in 
his arm and a second surgery for 
the removal of a bullet from his 
back.
The other three victims were 
treated for their injuries and
released. Men- ___________
sah was injured 
with a bullet 
in the arm and 
shoulder. James 
was injured with 
a bullet in the 
foot. Jackson 
was grazed on 
the hand by a 
bullet. ___________
The moments 
immediately following the 
shooting were stressful and cha
otic as Duquesne students were 
bombarded with uncertainties 
and worries of friends caught in 
the midst of the shooting.
It was hectic with all of the 
phone calls being made and the 
uncertainty about what had hap
pened, said Ally Susko, a senior 
at Duquesne University. Most 
of the people I spoke with called 
their families to let them know 
we were okay.
Duquesne students expressed 
their confidence in the safety 
of their campus even after the
shooting. The president of the 
university gave a speech to the 
students after the incident. Pro
fessors are still taking time out 
of class to discuss the shoot
ing, and the university held a 
candlelight vigil last Tuesday to 
show the communitys support 
for the victims and their friends 
and family.-
Something like this can happen 
anywhere in America.
 Sergeant William Ricci
This brought us closer to
gether, not only as a university 
but as a family as well, said 
Duquesne senior Laura Paterra. 
We just keep praying for the 
basketball players and their 
families.
Duquesne University is tak
ing action to improve campussecurity. According to MSNBC, 
the university is forming a com
mittee to examine safety on 
campus. Additionally, the uni
versity is upgrading existing 
campus surveillance cameras 
and allocating $250,000 for ad
ditional permanent police offi
cers and security guards, addi
tional campus bike patrols, and 
an additional parking garage 
patrol vehicle. They are also 
adding two new walk-through 
metal detectors and five metal 
detector wands.
I still view Duquesne as one 
of the safest campuses in the 
United States, Paterra said. 
_______ Even after the inci
dent, I still feel safe 
walking throughout 
the campus.
The Duquesne 
shooting follows on 
the heels of another 
recent campus shoot
ing. On September
13, a gunman opened 
------------ fire at Dawson Col
lege in Montreal, kill
ing one and injuring 19.
Something like this can hap
pen anywhere in America, said 
Sergeant William Ricci of the 
Carnegie Mellon University Po
lice. It could really happen any
where.
In light of the recent campus 
shootings, University police are 
examining ways to bolster secu
rity locally.
Were aware of the incident 
as are most universities across 
the country, Ricci said. Every
ones taking a look at their uni
versitys security and looking 
for improvement.
Sausages for charity
Hamerschlag House held their annual Sausagefest Friday afternoon at the Fence. Residents doled out 
sausages to the campus community in exchange for donations. The proceeds were donated to the Lance 
Armstrong Foundation.

Students cash in while living off campus
HOUSING, from A1
campus living.
Especially if youre paying 
the bills, you have to think about 
not using too much water or 
electricity, Huang said.
Despite these drawbacks, Ted 
Knowlton, an agent for Coldwell 
Banker, described one success 
story in the same Tribune-Review 
article.
He sold a one-bedroom house 
in Oakland six years ago to a 
family with a daughter attend
ing the University of Pittsburgh. 
They bought it for $38,500. They 
sold it last fall for $110,000.
Another concern for students 
living off campus is transporta
tion.
For example, Huang must find 
a way to get from Shadysides 
Walnut Street shopping district 
to campus every day. She does 
not have a car, so she had to find 
a place with a University Escort 
stop nearby. Sometimes, she 
walks.
Its kind of too far from school.
I stay less at home because Im a 
design major, so I dont think its 
that convenient, she said.
The distance has its perks, 
though.
You can do whatever to your 
house or room though. If you 
live on school property you cant 
paint the walls or anything, she 
said.
Another student, Trevor Braun, 
decided he preferred the privacy 
and freedom that off-campus liv
ing afforded.
It appears that he will be re
warded for his decision. He 
bought his townhouse for about 
$67,000. Recently, it was ap
praised at $90,000.
Braun opted to pay a flat rate 
of $240 per month for mainte
nance and utilities to a man
agement company, eliminating 
the hassle of separate bills. His 
mortgage is an additional $450 
a month.
On average, this investment 
is gaining about $5000 a year, 
said Braun, a sophomore in the 
Tepper School of Business. It 
should grow another $10,000 
before I graduate.
Braun lives in a condomin
ium complex three blocks from 
campus in Shadyside. After one 
year in Mudge, which he de
scribed as an okay experience, 
Braun decided he wanted more 
personal space.
There are liability issues with 
putting a 17-, 18-, or 19-year-old 
in his own house. If hes living in 
a dorm, he can make mistakes 
and not cause serious liability, 
Myers said. You just open your
self up to more exposure.
The Tribune-Review article 
suggests talking to a mortgage 
broker about the best neighbor
hoods for such investments.
Myers recommended a condo 
over a house, eliminating timeconsuming tasks such as fix
ing leaky roofs and mowing 
the lawn. He pointed out that 
housing options near the 
University arent the best, as 
many landlords have sat on older 
properties without making reno
vations.
You have to be careful when 
you buy a home on the top 
of the market and sell it four 
years later, Myers said. I per
sonally dont like a short window 
of opportunity. I think short
term real estate investments are 
difficult simply because of the 
exit costs.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 25, 2006
MBA grads dont always go Fortune 500
MBA, from A3
asset.
Arthur Boni, director of the 
Donald H. Jones Center for En
trepreneurship in the Tepper 
School of Business, believes that 
entrepreneurial spirit may be 
the very thing keeping Carnegie 
Mellon grads out of the corporate 
spotlight.
I did my undergraduate study 
here, and the thing I learned 
was how to collaboratively solve 
problems, he said. That skill set 
lends itself to success in any field, 
especially entrepreneurship. Its 
the Carnegie plan.
Bonis position on The Wall 
Street Journal article is similar 
to Adlers. The measure of busi
ness success is not being the 
CEO of a highly visible organiza
tion, he said. There is an entire 
economy out there with lots of 
leaders.
The article does point out a 
similar reason for a lack of eliteschool representation in corpo
rate America.
Hymowitz suggests that one 
reason elite alumni are not CEOs 
is that they tend to choose posi
tions in law firms or investment 
banks that enable them to earn 
large amounts of money very 
quickly and avoid entry-level 
management positions.
In opposition to this, Judith 
Mancusco from the Career Cen
ter said that most graduates 
typically filter into corporate 
America.
We have a much higher num
ber of successful grads. I chal
lenge them to tell us they have 
more Nobel Prize winners, 
she said, referring to the state 
schools that the article cites.
Half of the CEOs that the ar
ticle mentions went back to a top 
school to get their MBA. Those
companies obviously recognize 
the value of a top-tier educa
tion, she said.
In her conclusion, Hymowitz 
admits that approximately 65 
percent of top CEOs have an ad
vanced degree such as an MBA or 
a J.D.
Mancusco questioned the re
porters intent.
'This could just be an attempt 
to get some press for lower-profile schools, she said.
Last Tuesday, just one day af
ter the article was printed, The 
Wall Street Journal released its 
business school rankings.
The rankings, based on how 
recruiters rated each school, 
placed Carnegie Mellons Tepper 
MBA program at number three. 
Among the list of top business 
schools accompanying the uni
versity were Dartmouth, Har
vard, and Hymowitzs alma ma
ter: Columbia University.

New artificial arm 
requires thought
Jesse Sullivan is the first 
human to have a thoughtcontrolled artificial arm. His 
bionic arm is controlled by 
electrical signals sent from the 
brain through surgically re
routed nerves. The arm allows 
more movements and operates 
more smoothly than regular 
prosthetics.
Nerves were grafted onto 
muscle to receive thought
generated impulses. Electrodes 
pick up muscle activity and 
relay the signals to the arms 
computer, which causes motors 
to move the elbow and hand. So 
far the bionic arm allows four 
discrete movements; natural 
arms are capable of 22.
The militarys research-anddevelopment wing, the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects 
Agency, has joined the research 
to help troops who were 
wounded in Iraq and Afghani
stan and lost a limb.

Nadine Aubry named new head of mechanical engineering
by Shaina Stacy
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons mechanical 
engineering department has a 
new face.
Nadine Aubry was officially 
appointed head of the depart
ment of mechanical engineering 
this semester.
Im very excited, Aubry said 
of her new position. It is a very 
good department with a strong 
foundation. But we also have to 
make sure that we move it for
ward.
To move the department for
ward, Aubry hopes to promote 
large-scale research and to cre
ate a center for mechanical engi
neering.
Aubry also plans to introduce 
more globalization for research 
and education to the program so 
that students will be able to work 
in diverse environments and cul
tures.
Aubry herself is no stranger to 
diverse cultures. Born in France, 
she attended undergraduate
1
school at the National Polytech
nic Institute in Grenoble, France. 
After earning her B.S. degree 
there, she received her M.S. from 
Grenobles Scientific and Medi
cal University. She received her 
Ph.D. from Cornell University.
As a woman in engineering, 
Aubry encourages both women 
and minorities to major in me
chanical engineering. Aubry re
alizes that some young women 
think they have to sacrifice rais
ing a family for such a career, but 
she said that she has been able to 
dedicate time to her three chil
dren as well as her profession.
Its a challenging field, but 
women can do it too, said Au
bry. I think that as we increase 
in numbers, more women will 
become confident that they can 
major in engineering.
First-year student and me
chanical engineering major Jen
nifer Tang believes that having 
a female department head will 
encourage female scientists and 
engineers.
I think its great that the de
partment appointed a woman,
she said. It shows young women 
that they can be very successful 
in engineering.
Statistics taken from 1992 to 
2001 by the National Science 
Foundation reveal that a greater 
percentage of American women 
than men are receiving degrees 
in science and engineering. In 
2001, 97 percent of women who 
earned their bachelors degrees 
in science and engineering were 
U.S. citizens and permanent 
residents. This is compared with 
95.4 percent of natural-born men 
who earned bachelors degrees in 
these fields.
In the same category and year, 
78.3 percent of American women 
earned their masters degrees in 
science and engineering, while 
only 65.9 percent of American 
men did.
Although Aubry has faced her 
own challenges in the field, she 
cherishes her accomplishments 
and experiences.
You have to be strong, but its 
doable, Aubry said.
But if you ask me if I would 
do it again, yes. I dont regret 
1
anything. I am very happy to be 
where I am today.
After Carnegie Mellon con
tacted her about the position, 
Aubry decided to apply and at
tended a series of interviews.
Once the department made 
Aubry the offer, she had to go 
through the tenure process again, 
which required her to resubmit 
her resume and reference letters 
from students and faculty at the 
New Jersey Institute of Technol
ogy (NJIT).
As a professor at NJIT, Aubry 
taught undergraduate and grad
uate fluid mechanics courses. 
She was also the chair of NJITs 
department of mechanical engi
neering for five years and the re
search director of the New Jersey 
Center for Micro-Flow Control.
Outside of teaching, Aubry was 
involved with research in nano
technology and microtechnology, 
including microfluidics. She and 
her colleagues worked on design
ing channels that were only a little 
thicker than a strand of hair.
Aubry is the vice chair of the 
U.S. National Committee on TheJ
oretical and Applied Mechan
ics. Some of her other accom
plishments include winning the 
National Science Foundations 
Presidential Young Investiga
tor Award and being elected to 
the American Physical Society 
and the American Society of Me
chanical Engineers.
Nadine Aubry began her first year 
as the MechE departments head.

main benefits of going green.

nonprofit agency that integrates building 
design with environmental responsibility. 
The GBA is leading a nationwide notion to 
rethink building design.
Buildings in the United States are re
sponsible for about one-third of the na
tions total energy use. Yet, commercial 
buildings waste $42 billion in energy 
each year.
To help make Pittsburgh The Green 
Capital of the World, the GBA pro
motes education and research in green 
building design.
GBA Executive Director Rebecca 
Flora told the Pittsburgh PostGazette, We did some analysis early 
on and found [the alliance] is really 
the only organization of its kind in 
the country trying to determine 
how to best impact and transform 
the market.
Green buildings differ from reg
ular buildings in their construc
tion. They are designed to mini
mize environmental harm and 
maximize energy efficiency. No 
two green buildings are iden
tical, but there are common 
strategies to achieving green 
status.
The GBA recommends that 
buildings use natural light 
and ventilation raiher than 
mechanical sources of en
ergy. Additionally, the GBA 
encourages builders to re
cycle construction materi
als rather than disposing 
of them in landfills.
With increased en
ergy efficiency and less material waste, build
ings are less expensive to maintain.
The David L. Lawrence Convention Cen
ter in downtown Pittsburgh attests to these 
benefits. The convention center is the largest 
green building in the world end one of eight 
certified green buildings in Pittsburgh.
The convention center has a waterrecycling system that reduces potable wa
ter use by 60 percent. Additionally, day
light sensors and natural ventilation and 
light sources reduce energy consumption 
by 35 percent.
Carnegie Mellon is following suit with 
these green practices by setting out to 
make all on-campus buildings meet the 
silver standards of LEED, or Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design.
LEED provides a rating system for cer
tifying green buildings.
New House is the first dormitory at 
Carnegie Mellon to meet LEEDs silver 
standards. Henderson House, the Posner Center, and the Collaborative In
novation Center are designed to meet 
these standards as well.
Its a big step in the right direc
tion for us, said Alexa Huth, public 
relations intern for Carnegie Mel
lon Green Practices.
All of Carnegie Mellon is trying 
to become more green.
Research is another important 
step in getting the campus to go 
green. The Carnegie Mellon Cen
ter for Building Permanence and 
Diagnostics (CBPD) researches 
high-performance building de
sign.
Our goals are to provide the 
highest quality of work envi
ronment, said architecture 
professor and CPBD research 
faculty member Vivian Loftness. These goals include the 
use of natural ventilation, 
views, break spaces,' and 
daylight.
Loftness said that CPBD 
is also trying to turn build
ings into better energy

goes green
GREEN, from A8
sources. For example, the cen
ter developed a solar thermal 
system that collects solar en
ergy and outputs high-temperature water to power an air con
ditioner.
Green design is a much big
ger term than energy, Loftness 
said. She said that green in
cludes such practices as recy
cling water and using renewable 
materials in building design.
Loftness said that she would 
like to see both students and 
faculty become more environ
mentally conscientious.
I think we really do need to 
crank up the awareness so that 
everyone becomes an environ
mentalist.
Loftness said that there are no 
federal agencies focused solely 
on building research.
Theres just a tremendous 
amount of innovation that could 
occur, Loftness said.
Another on-campus organi
zation devoted to going green 
is Carnegie Mellon Green Prac
tices. The Green Practices com
mittee focuses on conserving 
the campuss natural resources 
and improving environmental 
quality.
Huth said that the organiza
tions biggest challenge is rais
ing awareness. We have to get 
our name out there ... Thats the 
first step to getting [people] in
volved.
Carnegie Mellon outputs ap
proximately 25,000 pounds of 
greenhouse gases per student 
per year. In 2002, five cents of 
every tuition dollar in revenue 
went toward energy expense.
Huth said that people can help 
in a number of ways, from recy
cling and turning off the lights 
to serving as an intern for Green 
Practices.
We would like people to help 
in any way possible.
From innovations in technol
ogy to conventional conserva
tion of water, going green is 
shaping Pittsburgh into a com
fortable and environmentallyresponsible area to live.

Each of the notched discs has 
one especially deep notch cor
responding to the jackpot. How
ever, the machine is built so that 
all three stoppers must land on 
their respective jackpot notches 
to activate the jackpot.
If the second stopper lands 
on the jackpot, a catch in the 
first stopper prevents the sec
ond from fully sinking into the 
notch, unless the first stopper 
has also landed on the jackpot.
Similarly, the third stopper 
will only sink into the deep 
notch if the first and the second 
are already in their respective 
notches.
Coins accumulate in a trans
parent case supported by the 
third stopper. When the third 
stopper descends into the jack
pot notch, it slips out of the way 
of the case and releases the jack
pot. .
Usually each disc has 22

number by the same value, typi
cally 64. The remainder of each 
quotient is what determines 
where its wheel will stop.
Though there are 64 possibili
ties, the player still only sees 22 
spaces on each wheel.
Multiple remainders are linked 
to each blank (losing) stop, but 
only one of the 64 is linked to the 
jackpot. The odds of hitting the 
jackpot are one in 262,144 (643).
For this reason, video slot ma
chines are said to be weighted, 
meaning that the odds are worse 
than they seem.
Though hitting the jackpot 
is extremely unlikely, its easy 
for slot players to win small 
payouts. The payback percent 
of a slot machine is the portion 
of your money you would win 
back if you played for an infinite 
amount of time. State laws regu
late slot machines by requiring a 
minimum payback percentage, 
typically within the 80s.
New slot machines provide 
a lot of options for each spin. 
Video machines allow the player 
to choose different payout pat
terns instead of the traditional 
three-in-a-row.
The machines with the larg
est jackpots are linked within 
statewide networks. Players 
can choose the size of their bet, 
the amount of wheels, and the 
amount of paylines.
Many of these machines pay
out amounts increase as more 
people play without hitting the 
jackpot.
Most slot machines are set to 
only reward the jackpot under 
the maximum bet available. 
You can make much longer 
odds, Brown said. A lot of peo
ple dont realize that.
Its a myth that slot machines 
can be due to hit the jackpot. The 
odds are the same for every spin, 
even after a string of losses. Its 
similar to flipping a coin; 100 
heads in a row dont increase the 
odds of getting tails.
But even if the odds are un
wavering and the handles are 
just for show, slot machines are 
extremely popular. Theyve got 
a hold on the American gam
bler, and not even math can 
explain that.

notches, so the chance of hitting 
a jackpot is one in 10,648 (223). 
Most machines offer smaller 
payouts in addition to the jackpot. 
This requires a more complicated 
version of the basic design.
Modern slots
In new slot machines, the 
handle serves no mechanical 
purpose; it might as well be a 
button.
Its all just a bunch of random 
numbers, basically, Brown said. 
Its all just math.
Even before a player places a 
bet, an internal random number 
generator is actively churning 
out numbers on the scale of sev
eral billion, each in less than a 
hundredth of a second. As soon 
as you pull the handle, the com
puter takes note of its next three 
random numbers.
The computer divides each
cam. The control cam releases 
the cam plate, which holds the 
three stoppers out of the way of 
the wheels.
The kicker tilts slightly for
ward, momentarily turning the 
three discs towards the front of 
the machine. It then jerks back
ward and sets them each spin
ning in the opposite direction.
The motion of the kicker is 
on par with a golf club hitting a 
ball, if the club had a very short 
backswing and a comparatively 
larger foreswing.
All the while, a spring is pull
ing the control cam slowly back 
to where it started. When it gets 
there, the control cam resets 
the cam plate so that the three 
brakes are no longer restrained. 
The breaks stop their respective 
wheels one at a time instead of 
all at once because each was ini
tially connected to the cam plate 
on a different catch.
Cherry... cherry... lemon\ 
Slot machines, or one-armed 
bandits, have long been a part 
of Americas gambling culture. 
While most casino games re
quire skill, large bets, and the 
ability to think under pressure, 
slot machines are engaging be
cause of their comparative sim
plicity.
For decades, the players of slot 
machines were mostly the wives 
and girlfriends of serious gam
blers. Though they date back to 
the turn of the 20th century, it 
took until the 90s for slots to re
ally take off.
One thing that really broke 
through all the clutter was when 
they came up with video ma
chines, said Duncan Brown, a 
game designer at Leading Edge 
Design.
Mechanical and video slot 
machines work differently on 
the inside, but both provide 
the same fundamental playing 
experience. A gambler inserts 
money and then pulls the ma
chines handle, thus spinning its 
wheels. The wheels stop one at a 
time and the machine dispenses 
money based on the symbols of 
the payline.
Different symbol combina
tions amount to different pay
outs.
Traditional machines
The central component of any 
older slot machine is a metal 
shaft. The metal shaft holds the 
three wheels that a player sees on 
the face of the machine, where 
the symbols are located. Each 
wheel is connected to a notched 
disc, which is basically a large 
gear around the shaft.
The mechanism that spins the 
wheels, called the kicker, looks 
like a rectangular plate. When 
the machine is at rest, one end of 
the kicker is stuck inside a notch 
in each of the three discs.
When a player inserts money 
into the machine, a coin detec
tor frees the handle. As soon 
as a player pulls, the kicker ro
tates a piece called the control

The Tartan is a student newspaper at Carnegie Mellon University, 
funded in part by the student activities fee. It is a weekly publication by 
students during the fall and spring semesters, printed by Valley News 
Dispatch, Inc. The Tartan is not an official publication of Carnegie 
Mellon University. The first issue is free; subsequent issues cost $0.50 
at the discretion of The Tartan. Subscriptions are available on a per 
semester basis.
What does TOC/BOC reveal about us?
Competitiveness and ambition thrive at the annual conferences
For two days last week, Carnegie 
Mellon seemed like a better place. The 
student body looked a little sharper  
engineers combed their hair, business 
majors dimpled their ties, and computer 
scientists traded their sweatpants for 
suit pants. There were also shiny toys 
to enjoy  sports cars parked outside of 
Merson Courtyard and novelty ice cubes 
that light up.
Say hello to the Technical and Busi
ness Opportunities Conferences (TOC/ 
BOC).
This is the time of year that careeroriented Carnegie Mellon students love 
and that corporations adore. Name
brand investment banks, consumer 
goods companies, and software groups 
set up shop in the University Center 
and watch the long lines of bright-eyed 
undergraduates form in front of their 
tables.
However, the TOC/BOC hoopla has a 
downside. The competitive nature of the 
average Carnegie Mellon student rears 
its ugly head. Those bright eyes are siz
ing up the line. Once-familiar friends are 
now competitors for the sacred entrylevel position at The Big Firm. Talking
to recruiters from the no-name private 
companies is scoffed at  a waste of a 
perfectly good rsum.
The TOC/BOC and the seasonal ordeal 
associated with it also bring some im
portant questions. Are we really ready to 
be the junior executives that we all dress 
up to be? We do have legitimately mar
ketable skills in programming, finance, 
systems engineering, and communica
tions, but we are still young and inex
perienced. We might have the confident 
stride, firm handshake, and the leather 
portfolio, but walking the walk and talk
ing the talk are very different.
Companies spend millions of dollars 
and countless man-hours promoting the 
prestige and familiarity of their brands 
in order to draw the most applicants 
and be able to pick only the best and the 
brightest young talent. Recruiters are ei
ther stern, there to intimidate, weed out 
the weak, and make prospective appli
cants want to work for them even more; 
or theyre saccharine to the point of con
descension.
Trends in competition and one-up
manship really surge after the coveted 
bachelors degree is earned. The Academy of Management Learning and Edu
cation recently surveyed 5300 MBA stu
dents (arguably the most career-focused 
students) around the country and found 
that 56 percent admitted to having pla
giarized, cheated, or otherwise com
promised their academic integrity. This 
percentage is the highest of any other 
graduate discipline. If a majority of 
graduate students stoop to dishonesty in 
order to achieve, then the 2001 corpo
rate debacles of Enron, WorldCom, and 
Tyco come as no surprise.
At the end of the day, your companys 
stock price or fancy name should not de
termine your self-worth. Nor should the 
novelty or quality of free stuff sway the 
decision of which company to work for. 
We need to step back and remind our
selves that we are still students. Even 
graduating seniors do not know every
thing they need to be successful outside 
of school. We hope Carnegie Mellon stu
dents ambition and motivation never 
wane, but we also hope they remember 
that signing bonuses, expense accounts, 
and corporate jets are nice, but honesty, 
consideration, and integrity are far more 
valuable.CMU and Google grow closer
For now, Google lifts us up  will it ever bring us down?
Carnegie Mellon is constantly try
ing to improve its brand recognition 
across the country and around the world. 
Typically, if you arent a high-powered 
executive, a cutting-edge computer sci
entist, a trailblazing roboticist  or a 
Pittsburgh native  Carnegie Mellon 
doesnt quite generate the same reac
tion as, say, dropping the Ivy League 
H-bomb.
However, in recent years we have 
come across a very powerful ally in this 
seemingly never-ending mission. One of 
the greatest brand names of the 21st 
century is becoming inexorably tied with 
Carnegie Mellon, for better or for worse.
Google, the great Internet search en
gine operator, was formed in 1998 and 
has rapidly grown into the most-used and 
most powerful search engine available. It 
is this rapid growth that has brought 
Carnegie Mellon into Googles inner cir
cle of influence and opportunity.
Last year, the company announced 
that it would be opening an engineering 
lab in Pittsburgh to make better use of 
Carnegie Mellon graduates. The head of 
this new lab? Carnegie Mellon computer 
science professor Andrew Moore.
More recently, Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members have contributed to several 
of Googles other offerings. Professor 
Luis von Ahn was recently featured in 
both Popular Science and The Tartan for 
his work on computerized image com
prehension. This year, he licensed his 
work to Google. Technology he created 
is now a part of Googles Image Labeler 
game, which harnesses the collective 
intellect of Internet users everywhere 
to sharpen and extend Googles image 
search capabilities.
Computer Science Dean Randy Bryant 
will be one of five judges for the Google 
Gadget Awards, a competition open to 
university. students to develop mini
mal web applications (gadgets) to in
corporate onto Googles personalized 
home page. These gadgets can serve 
any purpose, and will be judged on five 
different criteria: most useful, most 
intelligent, Most Likely to Help You 
Get a Date, most addictive, and pretti
est. Other judges include the editor-inchief of Wired magazine, the president 
of Stanford University, and the creator 
of popular tech news website Slashdot. 
It would seem that Google has caught
Carnegie fever  and vice versa.
But are we really going to benefit 
from this newfound attraction? All our 
work with Google raises a worrisome 
issue. What happens when people dont 
love Google anymore? Google already 
side-stepped a public relations night
mare when it began voluntarily censor
ing content in China.
Google has been running afoul of 
the government and other interested 
parties on our own soil as well. The 
company is spearheading a project to 
categorize and make searchable virtu
ally every literary work in existence. 
While this would allow people to access 
more knowledge and content than ever 
previously imagined, it also violates a 
healthy number of copyright laws and, 
according to many authors and publish
ers, threatens to undelrmine the entire 
printed-word economy.
As Google comes under more scru
tiny and shows signs of straying from its 
famous Dont be evil corporate motto, 
the Carnegie Mellon community should 
take a moment and contemplate what 
could happen as we become more and 
entangled with a global corporation.
Marshall Roy
Sometimes humor is shocking, but 
that doesnt mean everything shock
ing is funny.
That is the error that the editors 
of readme made last week when they 
published Carnegie Mellon Builds 
New Hauschwitz Dormitory. The 
article mocked, in disturbing detail, 
the horrors committed during World 
War II at the concentration camp 
of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The timing 
couldnt have been worse: The issue 
came out during the annual TOC/BOC 
(when many corporate recruiters are 
on campus and we try to project the 
best, most professional image we can) 
and 48 hours before the start of Rosh 
Hashanah.
Amid growing complaints about 
the issues content, it was pulled from 
circulation. Editor Chris Kier has also 
offered an apology (see Letter to the 
Editor on page All). That was the 
right thing to do  it shows maturity 
and compassion on Kiers part.
Interestingly, this course of action is 
exactly opposite to the one prescribed 
via e-mail by readmes former editor, 
Brian Leahy. How about you write 
a really insulting e-mail to whoever 
is complaining, Leahy wrote. Next 
week you should do a Nazi-themed 
issue called Heil readmeY and just 
go balls to the wall. Most photoshops 
should include Hitler, swastikas, and 
the Auschwitz gates.
When Leahy edited readme, obscen
ity and insult trumped'wit and satire. 
Since Kier has taken over, things have 
improved considerably. For the most 
part, the publication has stopped con
fusing bad taste with edginess, and has 
even made  in my humble estimation
 some noteworthy accomplishments 
in wordplay. (Phrasers set to pun 
and Laura Ingalls Wilders Snakes on 
a Plain are recent favorites.)
Some people might dismiss my 
criticism because Im not Jewish. 
That is short-sighted. I dont have to 
be Jewish to think it is wrong to mock 
Holocaust atrocities. Over the sum
mer I traveled to Poland and visited 
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Ive seen what 
remains of the gas chambers and the 
deep grooves left by the frantic claw
ing of the suffocated. Ive seen the 
piles of cookware, shoes, and framed 
photos of loved ones who never met
again. Ive read the plaques that state, 
in dozens of languages, For ever let this 
place be a cry of despair and a warning 
to humanity....
Considering what has since happened 
in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Darfur, it seems 
humanity has failed to heed that warn
ing. That is why its not funny.
Eighteen months ago, after the con
troversial visit of Norman Finkelstein, I 
interviewed a Holocaust survivor at the 
Squirrel Hill Jewish Community Center 
for an article in The Tartan. The pain in 
his voice was a meager indication of the 
pain in his past. I thought of him when I 
read the New Hauschwitz article.
Most people have never met a 
Holocaust survivor, so maybe Im overly 
sensitive. Too much sensitivity impedes 
humor  Kurt Vonnegut (now theres a 
good humorist) once wrote that if you 
open a window and make love to the 
world, youll get pneumonia. He meant 
that you cant try to appease everyone. 
Its impossible and unhealthy.
But Vonnegut has also pointed out 
that humor is an art. The best jokes are 
dangerous, he said in an interview with 
McSweeneys, because they are in some 
way truthful. The New Hauschwitz 
article, whatever its intentions, was not 
artfully honest. It was insensitive to 
communities that still feel the pain of the 
Holocaust and offensive to a readership 
whose sense of sophisticated humor was 
vastly underestimated, readme failed us 
all  Jewish and Gentile alike.
There is a way to laugh at serious sub
jects  one of humankinds greatest 
traits is its ability to find humor in just 
about everything. But the humor must 
be dignified, and it must leave its readers 
somehow richer. Last spring, when The 
Tartan decided to resume its traditional 
April Fools issue after a years hiatus, we 
discovered just how tricky intelligent 
satire can be. We were flabbergasted at 
how much work it takes. In that respect, 
we gained a much greater appreciation 
for what readme attempts every week.
The staff of readme has a marvelous 
opportunity to lighten up a campus that 
tends to take itself very seriously. Let 
them remember, though: Itll always be 
easier to shock people than make them 
laugh. But we didnt get to Carnegie 
Mellon by being the type of people who 
take the easy way out, did we?
Marshall Roy (mray@) is Forum editor 
of The Tartan. He welcomes all replies, 
but reminds readers that he was a senior 
in high school in April 2004, so if anyone 
wants to talk about the Natrat, he or she 
should kindly look elsewhere.

than a Punxsutawney phonebook.
Meanwhile, in America, modeling 
agencies arent rushing to eat more rice 
cakes either. Cathy Gould of New Yorks 
Elite agency publicly denounced the ban, 
saying its a gross discrimination against 
both the freedom of the designer and 
naturally gazelle-like models.
There may be such a thing as naturally 
gazelle-like. There is no such thing as 
naturally emaciated.
But its discrimination, Gould as
serted, comparing banning overly-skinny 
models with telling obese people to lose 
weight. Cathy, darling, we do tell obese 
people to lose weight. Because its not 
healthy.
Last month at a fashion show in South 
Africa, a models death sent chills up 
the bony spines of the haute world when 
22-year-old Uruguayan model Luisel 
Ramos died of heart failure after step
ping off a runway during Fashion Week 
in Montevideo. Ramos had reportedly 
maintained a diet of green leaves and Diet
Coke for three months. Thats no better 
than a McFood regimen of Big Macs and 
milkshakes  only in this case, we call it 
beautiful.
But its not the underweight models 
who are to blame  its the fashion indus
try who exploits them. These models are 
unnaturally starving to fit into size zeros, 
and the industry is to blame for parading 
gaunt frames and sunken-in eyes as fash
ion. Last week, a CNN reporter went 
backstage at an American fashion show 
to talk about the ban, and she noticed the 
only food sitting backstage  a bowl of 
granola. Duh, youre saying to yourself, 
the only reason theyre not eating card
board is because it gives them gas.
I do think theres a small subset of the 
population that has a biologically slender 
body type. But those who do dont just eat 
greens and granola. Todays models are 
doing something unnaturally, be it sus
taining a full-blown eating disorder or 
supporting a drug habit, which often goes 
hand-in-hand with an eating disorder.

organized, on the same page, 
and to keep focused. This list is 
in constant evolution for two rea
sons: We are acting on it and we 
receive feedback on these ideas 
the more we think about them 
and the more we discuss them, 
and adjust accordingly.
But our agenda contains more 
than what weve already set out 
to do. This third realm consists 
of all the unexpected projects, 
ideas, and suggestions we receive 
from you, the students. How does 
something end up in this third 
realm? Its simple. We promise 
 thats right, promise  to 
respond to your e-mails and meet 
with you in a timely manner. You 
may ask us anything. Dont know 
how to get something done? 
Cant get any information? Let us 
know. Our e-mail addresses are 
listed at the bottom of this col
umn every week. We will either 
answer your question or set up a 
meeting. If its important to you, 
its important to us.
But its more than just commu
nicating with campus. We want 
to communicate effectively, and 
to do that we must do more than 
be heard. We must listen to you. 
We change our speeches, our 
proposals, and our language as 
we receive criticism, and incor
porate these perspectives as we 
move forward. And, as we high
lighted earlier, we will make your 
concerns our priority. There are 
no excuses anymore. If were not 
doing a good job, tell us, and tell 
us directly. If we need to know 
about something, let us know. 
We may be called many things 
over the coming year, but lazy 
will not be one of them. Reform 
is difficult, but we will not relent. 
We can be flexible, we can be 
available and we can listen, but 
we will not drop the subject.
Wed like to end by telling you 
about our office. Its UC 318G. A 
couple of weeks ago, our office 
was filled with trash. We have 
been cleaning it because we plan 
to use it. There was junk in our 
office left over from three dif
ferent student body presidents.- 
Thats not how we will run our
selves and its certainly not the 
standard were holding ourselves 
to. We must do better, and we 
will, together.

What do you think would be the best mascot for Carnegie Mellon?A PERSONS OPINION

Madrid takesa stand against emaciation on the catwalk
In its last issue, readme printed 
an article describing a campus 
dormitory similar to a concen
tration camp. As a satirical pub
lication, readme often walks a 
fine line between what is humor
ous and what is overly offensive. 
Upon hearing the complaints of 
members of the campus commu
nity, we realize that this article 
crossed that line and apologize 
to all who took offense. The ar
ticle was meant as a satire on the 
Housing system and the overly 
enthusiastic nature of publicity 
media. It was never intended to 
mock or insult any member of 
the campus community.
In response to these com
plaints, we decided to stop cir
culation of the issue in question. 
Furthermore, to ensure some
thing like this does not happen 
again, we have decided to begin 
a new peer review system. Artitain role in this world  a role 
we expressed a desire to serve 
when we became members of 
our fraternities and sororities.
Why do most Greek organiza
tions perform incredible acts of 
service that require countless 
hours of dedication, while an 
unfortunate few are lethargic at 
best? Spend time with the latter 
type, and youll find a member
ship that has ceased to view ser
vice and community involvement 
as necessary elements of its iden
tity. Indeed, failing to serve no 
longer hinders their concept of 
what a good member is. It would 
no doubt be inspiring to see or
ganizations declare that their 
identity necessitates spreading 
the spirit of involvement to the 
world, around them.

Did you hear that? Models around 
the world just breathed a sigh of relief. 
And what a breath it was! Some havent 
breathed in years, because theyve heard 
sucking in makes them look thinner.
Beginning last Monday, Madrids fash
ion week, Pasarela Cibeles, redefined 
fashion. As it turns out, emaciation is not 
part of the fall collection. Its about time.
Responding to complaints from health 
associations and womens organizations 
about the influence of gaunt models on the 
body images of young women, the Madrid 
regional government, which sponsors the 
Pasarela Cibeles, ordered the shows or
ganizers to use healthy-weight girls. The 
fashion industry, they asserted, has a re
sponsibility to portray healthy body im
ages. Concha Guerra, the deputy finance 
minister for the regional administration, 
explained, Fashion is a mirror and many 
teenagers imitate what they see on the 
catwalk.
Do politicians have better things to do 
than regulate how much a model eats? 
Obviously. But should the Madrid gov
ernment be commended for promoting 
healthy body image in an era of walking 
skeletons? Absolutely.
Madrids fashion industry set a new 
standard based on the body mass index, 
or BMI. The BMI is a measure of body fat 
based on height and weight, and a BMI of 
under 18.5 is considered underweight. 
Now models must have a body mass index 
of at least 18.
Just how thin are catwalking skeletons 
now? The average model is about 59 and 
110 pounds. Thats a BMI of 16, which falls 
under the classification coat hanger. 
Now in Spain, a 59 model must weigh at 
least 123 pounds.
Other fashion venues are considering 
similar restrictions  notably the city 
of Milan, whose annual fashion show is 
more prestigious than Madrids. Reuters 
reported that top Israeli retail companies 
have also agreed not to employ overly thin 
models for their advertisements, while 
Indias health minister said he doesnt 
want waif-like models on the runway in 
his country either.
But organizers of the London Fashion 
Week, which also began last Monday, 
said they wouldnt be following suit. For 
the Brits, thin is still very much in. Lead
ing agency Models 1 made a statement, 
saying that Girls who model at 15 or 16 
tend to be thin girls whose mums are thin. 
Its part of their genetics, and obviously 
they look great in clothes. Obviously 
the British are seeing something Im not. 
Obviously they see something inherently 
attractive about girls who weigh no more
As a Carnegie Mellon and 
Sigma Phi Epsilon alumnus 
awaiting Peace Corps assign
ment, it was refreshing to see 
the Tartan Board and Univer
sity President Jared Cohon em
brace the outstanding example 
set by Carnegie Mellon Greeks 
through their many hours of ser
vice. Since the Tartan Board has 
called for Greeks to share their 
experiences and ideas regarding 
service, I feel compelled to share 
my own thoughts.
For service to become a regu
lar part of the organizational 
structure, organizational lead
ership must make a convincing 
case to its members that service 
is an intrinsic element of that 
organizations character. Greeks 
do not perform service because 
our leadership tells us to; we per
form service because we believe 
doing so helps us achieve a cerAndrea Hamilton, are indeed 
new, and my charge is theirs to 
consider.
However, all campus lead
ers can promote a sense that 
service is an essential part of 
the Carnegie Mellon experi
ence. Wouldnt it be nice to see 
Student Developments biggest 
monthly service event backed 
up by a Senate PR effort? Or 
how about the executives and 
Senators working together on 
periodic campaigns to focus 
student efforts, the way a Greek 
memberships energies are di
rected? College is, after all, an 
attempt to prepare us for the 
real world  a real world des
perately in need of our energy, 
organization, and service.

And whether its wrong or right, young 
girls look up to models, attempting to em
ulate their starving-child look. Girls: As 
Sally Struthers can attest, being impover
ished isnt glamorous. In fact, its usually 
associated with flies and malaria.
Would anorexia go away simply be
cause there were no more anorexic look
ing models? Probably not. But those who 
dont think it would help have already lost 
too much weight from their craniums. It 
would mark a significant shift in the cul
turally imposed definition of beauty, and 
thats a start.
In the meantime, I support the freedom 
of the designer. I say no one should hold 
them back from putting gazelles in their 
show, though I wonder how hooves will 
look in Chanel shoes.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 25, 2006
Carnegie Mellon football remains undefeated after four games
FOOTBALL, from A14
got open so I lofted it up and he ran 
under it. He made it easy for me, 
said Cakert. We work on it in prac
tice a couple times a week; its a fun 
play.
After allowing points in the first 
half for the first time this season, 
the Tartan defense was able to 
settle in and shut out the highpowered Diplomat offense in the 
second half. Senior cornerback 
Jonathan Scholl led the Tartan de
fense with 14 tackles. Senior cor
nerback Nat Scarmazzi added 11 
in the win.
On their 99-yard drive, we had 
a lot of chances to stop them and 
the third- and fourth-down conver
sions came up better for them, but 
we took that as motivation for the 
second half to come out and hold 
them scoreless, Scholl said.
The Tartans finished with 473 
yards of total offense, compared to 
F&Ms 329. Out of those 473 yards, 
253 were from the passing game, 
while the remaining 220 were on 
the ground. Junior fullback Travis
Sivek eclipsed the 100-yard rush
ing plateau for the third time this 
season, gaining 107 yards and a 
late touchdown on 20 carries.
Our offense was just awesome 
today; they did some great things, 
said head coach Rich Lackner. I 
think its a question of confidence. 
We have a lot of confidence in our 
passing game this year and right
fully so. Kevin has made good de
cisions; our kids have caught the 
ball well. It doesnt matter what 
level of football, football coaches 
are always talking about balance. 
This loosens up the secondary 
and gets the running game going 
and vice versa. You have to have 
the ability to keep that defense off 
guard, and we did that today. 
Wisniewski added, Its a great 
feeling to be 4-0. We still have a 
long way to go, and still have some 
tough teams on the schedule, so 
right now were focusing on Colo
rado College next weekend.
The Tartans will put their per
fect record on the line next week 
with a home game against Colo
rado College on Saturday at 7 p.m.Junior running back Robert Gimson (#21) out-sprints the competition. Gimson rushed for 93 yards against Franklin & Marshall on Saturday.

Mens soccer falls short on the road
Team records first two losses of the season
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Tartan mens soccer team 
suffered their first two losses of 
the 2006 season this past week, 
dropping to a 5-2 record. Their 
losses came on the road at the 
hands of Penn State-Altoona on 
Tuesday and Mount Union Col
lege on Saturday. The Tartans 
came into the week ranked 13th 
in the National Soccer Coaches 
Association of America top-25 
poll.
The Tartans lost 2-1 to Penn 
State-Altoona despite taking a 
1-0 lead into halftime. In the 
44th minute, senior forward 
Will Schlough netted his teamleading fourth goal of the sea
son off an assist from senior 
midfielder Sean Filipovitz. The 
Tartans could not make that one
goal stand up, as the Lions netted 
goals in the 67th and 83rd min
utes to collect the victory.
Against Mount Union on Sat
urday, the Tartans were shut out 
for the first time all season in a 
2-0 loss to the Purple Raiders. 
Mount Union scored early, in the 
12th minute, and added an in
surance goal in the 62nd minute 
to seal the win.
The Tartans held the advan
tage in the shot department in 
both games, edging the Lions 
12-11 and the Purple Raiders 
10-6. Sophomore goalie Mat
thew Bazin managed five saves 
versus-Penn State-Altoona and 
one against Mount Union.
Currently in the middle of a 
four-game road trip, the Tar
tans are preparing for more time 
away from home.
You prepare for it like you 
prepare for anything; you take 
it one day at a time, assistant
coach Rob Czlonka said. You 
work on the things that need 
to be improved upon from past 
games and what youre going 
to expect to face in the next op
ponent, and thats all you think 
about. You dont think about 
road or home or away. Its always 
great to be able to play on our 
new field; however, teams will 
get mentally prepared faster for 
an away game than they will for 
a home game.
Mens soccer will hit the field 
and try to find a win tomorrow 
when the team travels to Mari
etta College. The Tartans will 
then open University Athletic 
Association play on Saturday at 
the University of Chicago. The 
Tartans lost a 1-0 heartbreaker 
to the Maroons last year at home 
with the only goal coming in the 
79th minute. The two teams fin
ished tied for second place in last 
years association standings.
First-year Jessica Brackin (#14) and senior Malena Yablinsky (#6) team up to return the ball.
Womens tennis sweeps Grove City 9-0
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
tennis team traveled to Grove 
City College on Tuesday for their 
first dual meet of the season, 
shutting out Grove City 9-0.
In doubles, senior Mai Otsuka and sophomore Claire 
Weiss began the day with an 
8-1 win over Grove City players 
Julie Bellissimo and Erin Ben
nett. Next, senior Mona Iyer and 
partner junior Amy Staloch won 
their match 8-2 over opponents 
Nicole Andreini and Tamara 
Nations. First-years Andrea 
Meythaler and Alisa Liebowitz 
also posted an 8-2 score in their 
match against Grove City dou
bles team Kristin McNally and 
Lindsey Hosier, giving the Tar
tans a 3-0 lead heading into the 
singles matches.
In singles play, Staloch, at 
number-one singles, dominated
Adreini Otsuka 6-0, 7-5. Iyer 
trounced McNally 6-1, 6-1 at 
number-two singles. Otsuka 
again faced Bellissimo, defeat
ing her 6-0, 6-3. Weiss went on 
to dominate Baldwin 6-0, 6-2. 
Liebowitz and Meythaler both 
posted 6-1, 6-0 scores over op
ponents Bennett and Nations.
The Tartans then traveled to 
Fredericksburg, Va., to compete 
at the ITA Regionals at the Uni
versity of Mary Washington this 
weekend. Play finishes today.
Womens volleyball hosts invitational
teams from going on runs, Toney 
added. Volleyball is a sport of 
momentum, and we need to 
work on building the momentum 
and keeping it.
The volleyball team travels to 
Emory University this weekend 
for their first University Athletic 
Association (UAA) round robin 
of the season.
We have tough matches this 
weekend in Atlanta, Toney said. 
UAA competition is always 
fierce because we are up against 
schools with high-caliber aca
demics and high-caliber volley
ball programs. It will be fun to 
see how we play and what our 
conference is looking like this
matter who was substituted into 
the game, the team adjusted and 
played together.
Carnegie Mellon was unable 
to shut out the competition com
pletely, though, as they fell to 
Stevens 1-3 in their last match of 
the tournament.
The Ducks took the first game 
30-25, but the Tartans battled 
back, winning the second game 
30-28. Stevens won th next two 
games (30-26 and 32-30), and 
won the match.
Stevens was a tough and up
setting game, said Fox. We are 
a more talented team than them, 
but something just didnt click. 
We need to work on finishing
VOLLEYBALL, from A14
we could work under pressure.
Carnegie Mellon capped off 
the night with another 3-0 win 
against the Nazareth Golden Fly
ers 30-13, 30-24, 30-17.
Returning to play on Satur
day, the Tartans faced Rochester 
Institute of Technology (RIT) at 
noon and Stevens Institution of 
Technology at 4 p.m. The Tar
tans dominated the RIT Tigers, 
posting a 3-0 (30-21, 30-18, 
30-26) win.
Nazareth and RIT were good 
confidence boosters. We have a 
deep bench, and we utilized it 
during these two games, Fox

Womens soccer splits 1-1
Ai 4
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
To start the week, Carnegie 
Mellon womens soccer trav
eled to Washington & Jefferson 
College (W&J) and took the 
Presidents in a 1-0 decision. 
On Saturday, the Tartans fell to 
Denison University 1-0 in Gran
ville, Ohio.
In Washington, Pa., on Mon
day, junior Jessica Howard 
scored the only goal of the game 
late in the first period off of a cor
ner kick taken by junior Amanda 
Rose. The goal was Howards 
third of the season.
Amanda Rose had a perfect 
corner kick, said junior Kasey 
Stever. The goalie went up for a 
save but fumbled it. Jess was in 
the perfect position to one-touch 
it in.
In the second half of the game, 
the Presidents were unable to 
even the game up, taking only 
three shots on goal, none of 
which made it past sophomore 
goalkeeper Christie Adams.
The Tartans had 18 shots 
throughout the game, 11 of 
which were saved by W&J goalie 
Jackie Foltz. First-year Casey 
Garth, Stever, and Howard each 
had three shots on goal during 
the game.
The win on Monday brought 
the Tartans season record to 
3-2-1 and the Presidents record 
to 4-3-1. The Tartans were un
able to carry their momentum 
into the weekend, coming up 
short against nationally ranked 
Denison University 1-0.
The Big Red attacked early 
when Jessie Birdwhistell scored 
an unassisted goal in the 13th
minute of play. Birdwhistell 
gathered a deflected ball and 
chipped irover Adams shoulder 
to collect the only goal of the 
game.
Denison scored early, which 
made us feel like we had a lot of 
time to get the game back, Ste
ver said. But before we knew it 
there was 15 minutes left, then
10, then five, then none  we 
didnt have a sense of urgency.
The Tartans offense was 
shut down by the Big Red; they 
were only able to manage two 
shots throughout the game. 
The shots were taken by Stever 
and Howard, and neither shot 
was on goal. In contrast, Adams 
was pummeled by Denison. The 
team had 16 shots, 11 of which 
were taken in the second period. 
Adams had seven saves through
out the game.
Denison was a very good 
team, the best we have played so 
far this season, head coach Sue 
Willard said. Our youth showed. 
We went out there and Denison 
threw some stuff our way and 
we panicked a little bit.
We werent connecting with 
each other, said Stever. We 
usually play a possession game, 
but yesterday we couldnt string 
many passes together, leaving us 
with very few attacking oppor
tunities. After losing to Deni
son, the Tartans record falls 
to 3-3-1 while the Big Red im
proves to 8-1-0.
The Tartans play two more 
games on the road before return
ing home, playing Allegheny 
College at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday 
and the University of Chicago at
11 a.m. on Saturday in their first 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) matchup of the season.

When Franklin & Marshall Col
lege (F&M) gained momentum 
late in the first half  heading 
into halftime trailing by only a 
touchdown  the Tartans knew 
they needed a strong second half 
to improve to 4-0. Carnegie Mel
lon got just that, shutting the Dip
lomats out in the final 30 minutes 
on the way to pulling away with 
a 34-14 victory on Saturday af
ternoon at Gesling Stadium.
A quartet of big plays high
lighted the scoring in the first 
quarter. Senior quarterback 
Kevin Mulkern completed six of 
11 passes for 205 yards and gave 
the Tartans an early lead thanks 
to long touchdown passes to 
sophomore tight end Derek Wisnieski and junior wide receiver 
Jeremy Doo in the first quarter.
Wisnieskis 77-yard touchdown 
reception got the Tartans on the 
board, and Doos 54-yard touch
down catch and run increased 
Carnegie Mellons lead to 14 with 
5:55 remaining in the opening 
quarter.
Last week we had the same 
play and I dropped the ball, 
said Wisnieski, who caught four 
passes for 131 yards and two 
touchdowns on the day. The 
coaches said they were going 
to give it another chance and it 
came open for us. I was really 
happy we got that score real 
quick and got up big.
F&M answered with a big play 
of its own to cut the lead to 14-7, 
but Tartan junior running back 
Robert Gimson showed how dan
gerous the Tartan offense is with 
his career-high 58-yard touch

down scamper to conclude the 
scoring in the first quarter. Gim
son finished with 74 yards on 12 
carries.
Things got interesting late in 
the first half after F&Ms 20-play, 
99-yard scoring drive cut the 
Tartan lead to 21-14 with 2:09 
remaining in the second quarter. 
A fourth-down roughing-thepunter penalty kept the drive 
alive for the Diplomats, who then 
went on to convert two fourthdown opportunities, the lat
ter being a 20-yard touchdown 
pass.
The Tartans set up their twominute drill, hoping to increase 
their lead going into halftime, 
but senior kicker Nathaniel 
Greensteins 33-yard field goal 
attempt was blocked as the half 
ended.
The Diplomats were forced to 
punt on their opening posses
sion of the second half, and the
Tartans began to pull away from 
F&M. Carnegie Mellon lined up 
for a 42-yard field goal attempt, 
but after receiving the snap, 
holder Jonathan Kline handed 
the ball off to senior running back 
Jon Cakert, who then set up and 
passed to a wide open Wisnieski 
for a 24-yard scoring strike.
I was a little nervous. Wis
nieski got out a little late, but he

On Saturday the mens and 
womens cross country teams 
were back in action With the 
men splitting up to compete at 
Penn State and Saint Vincent 
College in Latrobe, Pa., and the 
women racing at Saint Vincent. 
The mens top 14 runners trav
eled to Penn State to compete 
in the Spiked Shoe Invitational, 
finishing 11th overall out of 
24 teams. The rest of the mens 
team and the womens team ran 
at the Saint Vincent Invitational, 
finishing fourth and third, re
spectively.
Mens cross country
At Penn State, the men com
peted against Division I, II, and
III schools. The Tartans finished 
11th overall, but second out of 
the Division III schools behind 
Mount Union College.
Sophomore Brian Harvey had 
another strong race as he fin
ished first for the team and 36th 
overall with a time of 27:05.35 
over the 8K course. Bryan ran 
very well for a first guy with 
some good runners, said head 
coach Dario Donatelli, so I was 
very pleased with that.
First-year Dario Donatelli, the 
son of the coach, built on his suc
cess last week as well, finishing 
second for the team and 51st 
overall with a time of 27:31.95.

Senior Steve Kaplan led the 
Tartans with a time of 28:46, fin
ishing fifth overall and first for 
the team. I didnt do any racing
for the last nine months, said 
Kaplan. For me its just getting 
back into racing. Racings pretty 
much running yourself into the 
ground. Its really how to push 
yourself that far.
Behind Kaplan, sophomore 
Bill Lordan and junior Doug 
Fricker finished second and 
third, respectively, for the team 
with times of 29:47 and 29:49.

by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
volleyball team hosted the Carn
egie Mellon Crossover this week
end. Seven schools from Penn
sylvania and Ohio attended the 
tournament.
The Tartans played four games 
in two days, winning the first 
three. Adding those wins to a 
win on Wednesday against the 
University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg, the Tartans season record 
moves to 7-8. Coming into the 
week 3-7, the Tartans are now 
two games away from a winning 
record.
Warming up for the weekends 
invitational, Carnegie Mellon 
traveled to Pitt-Greensburg on 
Wednesday, defeating the Bob
cats 3-0 (30-23, 30-25, 30-28). 
Seniors Catie Fisher and Amanda 
Bradford led the Tartan offense 
with 14 and 10 kills, respectively. 
Senior Brea Carlock had 23 as
sists, while first-year Samantha 
Carter added 15 assists to the 
team total.

Senior Kat Fox led the Tartans 
defensively with 10 digs, closely 
followed by first-year Cara

The competition [PittGreensburg] wasnt of our caliber, 
and it was more a good practice 
for us, said junior middle hitter 
Abbie Toney. We were able to 
put a lot of the team in, change 
up positions, and still keep our 
heads afloat.
The Tartans played four games 
during the Crossover, which was 
held in the University Center over 
the weekend. Carnegie Mellon 
played a doubleheader on Friday 
night, facing Gettysburg College 
at 6 p.m. and Nazareth College at
8 p.m.
The Tartans outplayed the 
Gettysburg Bullets 3-0 (30-24, 
32-30, 34-32). Beating Get
tysburg, which is our coachs old 
team, in only three games was 
an amazing accomplishment, es
pecially with such close scores, 
Fox said. The team proved that

The mens soccer team domi
nated the start of the season, go
ing 5-0 before losing their first 
game to Penn State-Altoona 1-2 
this past Tuesday. Leading the 
team with four goals and three
assists, senior midfielder Will 
Schlough has been integral to 
the Tartans success. The Tartan 
spoke with Schlough about his 
success on and off of the soccer 
field.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing soccer and why?
Schlough: I have always 
played. I was probably six or 
seven when I started playing 
organized team soccer. My older 
brother played, so it was just a 
game I grew up playing.
T: So your family has been 
very supportive during your 
soccer career?
S: They never made it hard. It 
was always my choice, but they 
definitely enjoyed it. They were 
always the ones taking me to 
games and encouraging me.
T: Did you always plan on 
playing soccer in college?
S: All through high school I 
had not really been sure. There 
was a time when I was definitely 
questioning it, but then when it 
came down to it, it is just some
thing that I really love and knew

I wanted to stick with.
T: What is the hardest part 
of being a student athlete at 
Carnegie Mellon?
S: Definitely time manage
ment. Everyone here is so busy 
already, and soccer is one more 
thing to balance in with all the 
work. It is good, though. Practice 
and hanging out with the team 
is a break from my work, and it 
helps me relax a little.
T: Where is your favorite place 
to compete?
S: At home is definitely my 
favorite place to play. We have 
a good winning record at home, 
we play pretty well at home, the 
new field is great, and it is al
ways nice to have the fans there 
supporting you.

T: So when you actually have 
free time to relax, what is it you 
like to do?
S: Well, soccer and art are 
the two things I enjoy most, 
but thats really what occupies 
most of my time now. I like the 
outdoors, but I really never have 
time to get out and go camping
or anything. I guess when I have 
free time I like to just lay on the 
couch, catch up on some sleep, 
or watch some TV.
T: What do you think is the 
teams greatest accomplishment 
this season?
S: We have finally gotten 
some recognition this year, 
which is great. We were ranked 
21st by the NSCAA, which is a 
big accomplishment. It is nice 
to know we are nationally ac
knowledged.
T: The team had its first loss 
Tuesday. How are you and the 
team handling that? What plans 
do you have for the rest of the 
season?
S: The loss was a shock. Plain 
and simple we were just out
played. We kind of all had a 
feeling like our game was slip
ping a little, and thats definitely 
something we are working on. 
We have high aspirations for 
the rest of the season so we are 
definitely going to be working 
harder, but we have a strong 
team and good freshmen so it 
should worl: out well.

Exhibits embrace anti-war activism , . _
Collaboration at the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery Did yOU KflOW (
Challenging the norm and society, two artists 
currently featured in the Regina Gouger Miller 
Gallery in Purnell are making statements about 
political issues past, present, and future; moving their 
audience members; and compelling them into action.
Joyce Kozloff's exhibit Exterior and Interior 
Cartographies is exactly what it says: cartography. 
This ancient study of maps has never typically 
been revered for its aesthetic nature or riveting 
subject matter. However, Kozloffs work absolutely 
revamps her subject by adding flair and meaning. 
Kozloff earned a BFA from the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology in 1964 and an MFA from Columbia 
University in 1967. She is cunently a member of 
Artists Against the War. The works shown in the 
Miller Gallery are a collection of Kozloffs work over a 
span of about 10 years.
In the exhibit, splashes of rich color and collage 
adorn traditional nautical maps. Hand-drawn figures 
and scenes of war overlap on paper as Kozloff works 
to dispute old political faculties. On the third floor, 
Sing-Along American History: War and Race is a 
motley of different well-known historical landmarks 
and issues: The Mason-Dixon Line, Gettysburg, 
and the Louisiana lowlands blend with drawings 
of different ethnicities and fragments of old songs. 
Similarly, American History: Going Global is set 
on a red backdrop, showing a map of the world 
blanketed with American tanks and soldiers.
In the middle of the gallerys second floor, the first 
thing that draws your attention is a cradle placed 
in the center of the floor. Titled "Rocking the 
Cradle," the work has a blue interior with navigation 
arrows pointing towards places such as Babylon, 
Apolloniatis, and Baghdad  sort of the cradle 
of civilization. A truly inspiring piece, "Bodies of 
Water is an acrylic-on-canvas work that depicts a 
nautical map of the sea. Layered on top of the map 
are quantities of cut and glued collages of parts of the 
human digestive, respiratory, and circulatory systems.
Kozloff spoke of her time at both a chiropractors office 
and on a ship as a crew member. These experiences 
combined resulted in the creation of the piece. "The 
rivers and streams inside the body are like the ones 
in- topographic maps, and I was somehow intuitively 
making that connection, Kozloff said.
Also on the second floor are a series of frescoes. The 
frescoes on panels give a warped, almost 3-D feel to 
the maps, typically flat. Kozloff captures the feel of 
certain cities perfectly, tastefully blending the culture 
and atmosphere of each. "A Tale of 3 Cities: Los 
Angeles 1878, New York 1661, Roma 1561" is a series 
of frescoes done on three panels. Los Angeles is done 
in a sandy, sort of desert-colored underlay and is very 
grid-like, with a concentrated network in the center. 
New York shows flags and ships of Denmark with a 
grassy-green depiction of the current-day financial 
district. Roma is done in black and white, with the 
exception of spot color on a small area in the center 
labeled in Latin, and the small panel is completely 
covered with densely-populated houses and buildings.
Kozloff said her favorite piece was Dark and Light 
Continents." The most captivating piece by far,
Dark and Light Continents" is a gigantic map of the 
world where the lighter areas represent the more 
populated regions and the darker areas represent 
those uninhabited. Stars strewn across the canvas 
are actually constellations, so that the work looks like 
a view of earth from behind the stars.
On the first floor of the Miller Gallery, a three-screen 
video documentation attracts the attention of 
visitors. Disarming Images" is an hour-long slide 
show of the movements all around the United States 
in opposition to the war in Iraq. The movie follows 
the protests from the time of 9/11 up through the 
third anniversary of the start of the war.
The creative director of the Regina Gouger Miller 
Gallery, Anne Messner, is currently an adjunct 
professor at Pratt Institute. Like Kozloff, Messner 
is a member of Artists Against the War. She 
spoke on the wealth of images and information 
from the compilation of footage from people and 
various sources around the country. We put out 
an open call all through the Internet, and people 
responded," Messner said. Those interested sent 
in footage and materials of their own accord in an 
effort to contribute to a film that could educate the 
world on American opposition to the war in Iraq. 
Mesmerizing and deeply moving images paired 
with music, voiceovers, and text serve to paint a 
picture of a countrys unrest. On the right-hand 
screen, a steady stream of facts and statistics 
inform the viewer about the images on the screen 
and also describe the happenings in the anti-war 
movement since 9/11. "We really sought multiple 
sources to make sure it was as accurate as possible. 
It is a particular point of view. It doesnt pretend 
to be objective in its direction, but it is factual, 
Messner said.
The video documentary displays peaceful protests, 
speeches, and signs all across the United States. 
Footage of distraught Iraqis is interwoven with 
images of Iraqis and Afghans in their everyday 
lives, faces of deceased American armed forces, 
and Arabic and American weeping mothers. These 
images act as strong social and political commentary. 
Our friend, whose name is Debra Werblud, felt very 
strongly that something more permanent that could 
travel to more places should be done in multiple 
languages about the peace movement taking place 
in the United States, since outside the United States, 
many people presume that Americans are all in 
support of the war," Kozloff said.
Kozloff's exhibit and Messner's video documentation 
will remain in the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery until 
October 15. With these exhibits, you can see what 
makes cartography so interesting or take advantage 
of an opportunity to see a perspective of what has 
been going on in our country different from what's 
been in the news.

Cigarette manufacturer Phillip Morris published an 
ad in The Tartan. This advertisement includes a couple in a speeding MG sports car, complete with instructions on how to choose the limp, plump, firm, white cigarettes brimming full with tobacco 
goodness. Precisely what all swell, young, clean- cut CIT students needed to commence their healthy, happy year.
Service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega began 
accepting applications for the Ugliest Man on Campus contest to be held during Homecoming 
Weekend. Its surprising that the contest wasnt held closer to Halloween. Considering the stiff competition, this event was expected to be a 
brutally ugly one.
Carnegie Mellons radio station, WRCT, was 
relocated to the basement of the University Center. Though the crew had settled into a new location, they quickly resumed playing the experimental shows students love most: Satan Oscillate my 
Metallic Sonatas, Techno Terrorists, Geek Radio, 
Skank Some More!, Fear and Whiskey, and best of all, Elmer Elf and Cookie Friend.
Fans joyfully cheered on the Carnegie Mellon football team Saturday afternoon as the Tartans took on Franklin & Marshall College from Lancaster, Pa. Making up the majority of the crowd in attendance? Not the Amish, but the good old Kiltie 
Band, our very own spunky kilt-clad clan.
With the Business Opportunities Conference 
afoot, The Tartan gave some pointers to students regarding proper etiquette and fashion. Among the 
recommended decorum, Tartan staffers strongly suggested not wearing programming or Star Wars T-shirts, not wearing socks with Birkenstocks, and of course, showering prior to the event. Of course, 
most business students are already well aware of these guidelines. Hopefully.

Jacks Mannequin on display in Southside
At Club Zoo, frontman Andrew McMahon offers audience a Holiday from Real
The night started with Daphne Loves Derby playing a pretty 
short set while people were still filtering in to Club Zoo. The 
next two warm-up bands, The Hush Sound and Copeland, 
played their respective sets with that one song most people 
knew. The Hush Sound definitely had the most energy out of 
the three, but all the while the not-so-hush sound of "Im just 
here for Jacks Mannequin could be heard from the crowd.
Before I went to the concert, Id heard from someone that 
Club Zoo wasnt that great of a venue  they had the space 
but didn't use it. I completely disagree. It is the best venue 
Ive been to in Pittsburgh thus far. The main floor was packed 
with people, and only became more dense as the night went 
on. The other levels were lined with people that enjoyed being 
able to breathe and listen to music at the same time. Sure, 
not all spots yielded the best view; some rested nicely behind 
huge metal support beams. Nevertheless, the energy filled the 
entire club. Mr. Small's, another local venue, would have to 
grow to "Mr. Bigs" to hold this many people.
I opted for the real concert experience in the giant mess of 
sweaty people, so I spent three sets of warm-up bands getting 
up to the front. I realize that this is usually looked down upon 
by those kids who get to the concert five hours early, but this 
crowd really got into it. Every few minutes there would be a 
huge surge, first forward, then backward, then more people 
forward, until no one could move anymore; all the while, 
people were dancing.
At 9:31 p.m., Andrew McMahon, Mannequins creator/ 
pianist/singer, ran onto the stage. Words cannot possibly 
describe the energy and passion this man exudes. The crowd 
went nuts. All surfaces of the old warehouse were shaking, 
and McMahon started playing.
He started with two fan favorites: "Bruised and "Kill the 
Messenger. The first three songs, ending with Im Ready, 
were an explosion of emotion that the whole crowd felt. 
McMahon didnt stop moving and no one stopped listening. 
Whether you like his music or not, you cant help but feel his 
love for what he does.
After "Miss Delaney, an unreleased B-side track, and Dark 
Blue," "Holiday from Real elicited a loud Fuck yeah! We 
can live like this" from the crowd. Everyone joined in singing 
when McMahon paid homage to his roots with Me and the 
Moon," a song by Something Corporate (McMahon's band 
before Jacks Mannequin). Everyone joined in pretending to 
sing along when McMahon paid homages to his roots roots 
roots with his cover of Simon and Garfunkels "Homeward 
Bound.
After a few more songs and-a harmonica break, McMahon 
paused to tell the crowd that the proceeds from the concert 
were going to charity. Sadly, no one heard the name of the 
charity because the cheering was too loud. Shortly after, 
things quieted down while McMahon sang a song he wrote
for his sister. It was a beautiful acoustic solo, written half 
before and half after McMahon was diagnosed with leukemia, 
and brought the emotion of the night to a crescendo.
Made for Each Other acted as the perfect closer for the 
night, just as it does on its album. McMahon had been 
playing an electric piano all this time, not quite as rugged 
as the upright he played in Something Corporate. One of his 
schticks in Corporate was to stand on the keys of the piano 
and play with his feet. When I saw this keyboard I thought it 
was sad that Andrew wouldn't be able to do his piano dance, 
but he did it anyway. Never missing a beat, he kicked over 
his stool and hopped up onto the keyboard, playing a flurry of 
notes that somehow still fit with the song.
Sitting back down, with a final flourish on the piano, the lights 
turned out, and McMahon left the stage. That was it. The 
concert was over. The crowd shuffled out quietly, still high on 
that feeling Jack's Mannequin left them.

Benga rocks the Warhol
Eclectic mix of artists perform tonight
Extra Golden, a four-member band composed of two 
Kenyan Benga musicians and two American rockers, is 
making a stop at the Andy Warhol Museum to promote 
their first album, Ok-Oyot System. "Once people hear us 
play, they pretty much know they need to dance, said 
Alex Minoff, one of the band members. Extra Golden 
produces a unique sound, an eclectic fusion of rock 
music and the buoyant tunes of eastern Africa.
Extra Golden was formed in. 2004 when Ian Eagleson, 
a member of the Washington, D.C.-based rock band 
Golden, was conducting his doctoral research on Benga 
music in the Lake Victoria region of Kenya, where 
Benga music, which is characterized by its use of 
syncopated melodies, originated in the 1950s and '60s. 
Otieno Jagwasi and Onyango Wuod Omari of Extra 
Solar Africa were playing as the house band for a bar in 
Nairobi when Eagleson and bandmate Minoff invited 
them to collaborate on an album, the result being OkOyot System.
The band recorded Ok-Oyot System, which means 
"Its Not Easy in the Luo language, during the day at 
the same bar where Eagleson and Minoff first spotted 
Jagwasi and Omari. The "studio" was a portable laptop 
that they affectionately called the Nyathi Otenga Flying 
Studio. Minoff explained that because Benga only uses 
certain chord progressions, none of which are minor, 
Jagwasis songs had to be transposed in order to make 
them sound more rock. Other than that minor obstacle 
(no pun intended), the Benga/rock crossover was not a 
difficult transition to make. The two styles complement 
each other and produce a riyeting, emotional sound that 
still has the upbeat rhythm of a dance track.
Ok-Oyot System is a six-track album full of catchy guitar 
riffs, colorful melodies, and energizing percussion. Three 
of the six songs on the album, Dando Gima Onge," OkOyot System, and Osama Ranch are fusions of rock 
and Benga. Nyajondere" is a song in traditional Benga 
style, sung by Jagwasi about his ex-wife, and Its 
Not Easy" and '"I\issin and Fightin  are mostly rock, 
although they do have a bit of African flavor.
The songs range from six to 12 minutes, but the 
listener's attention never wavers. Ilando Gima Onge 
is an exceptional example of a fusion of Benga and
rock. The song opens with a catchy, Middle-Easternsounding guitar riff that reoccurs throughout the song, 
contrasting nicely to Jagwasis earthy vocals. The 
song crescendos into a toe-tapping chorus with the 
overlapping vocals of Omari, and this multitextural 
sound holds the listener until the final bar.
For fans of more traditional rock, Its Not Easy has a 
mellow, tropical sound inflected by a guitar line that 
takes you right to the beach. I had a guy come up to 
me after a concert and say that he feltlike he was back 
on the islands, sipping a drink with a little umbrella, 
Minoff said. He explained that a listener who is not 
accustomed to Benga may mistake it for a kind of Jack 
Johnson-esque sound, when really it's just the major 
chords in the progressions that invoke those happy, 
relaxing feelings.
The production of the album was not entirely a smooth 
process. During the recording, the band members had 
a run-in with Kenya's police when detectives from 
Kenyas Criminal Investigation Department planted 
marijuana in the bands apartment. The Kenyan police 
basically created a set-up, Minoff said. "People showed 
up with sticks of bhangi, and then 30 minutes later, the 
police were knocking on our door. It was fishy." To finish 
the recording (and stay out of prison), the band had to 
pay a hefty amount out of their own pockets.
The Extra Golden concert is a must-see, a logical next 
step for anyone who enjoys The Postal Service or any 
other band thats created a new sound by combining 
different styles of music. To treat yourself to a unique 
Benga/rock fusion, or to give your ear a break from che 
monotonous-sounding songs on the radio, check out 
Extra Goldens Ok-Oyot System. Just make sure youre 
ready to dance.
Extra Golden will be playing 10 p.m. tonight, September
25, at the Andy Warhol Museum. Tickets are $10. 
Jagwasi, on guitar and vocals, died last May of 
complications involving HIV. He is replaced on the tour 
by Opiyo Brilongo.

Free musical improvisation involves playing an instalment without the 
restraints of traditional imposed rhythm or tonality. Free improvisation, 
at ieast in the context discussed here, developed from jazz-oriented 
thinking in the early 1960s. Musicians weli versed in be-bop jazz 
such as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman began to disassociate 
their music from jazz structure, tonality, and time signature, creating a 
completely new genre of music.
Since that time, many musicians have used free improv as a vehicle 
for exploring a boundless array of sonic realms. Most still make use 
of the group setting in which members of an ensemble play together 
and thus inform each other's playing. There are those who play alone, 
however, and therefore produce music that is informed solely by the 
mind of an indMdual. Much of the work that employs this method 
of playing can be viewed as a sort of musical free-association upon 
which the individual can decide how much, or how little, restraint 
to impose. Flaying solo in this fashion is clearly a very personal 
endeavor, and extends musicians the opportunity of creating a very 
powerful final product. Solo free improvisation that employs the 
saxophone as a medium has an especially powerful body of work 
attached.to it, due partly to the saxophones wide sonic range as well 
as its historical significance in the setting of jazz improvisation (e.g. 
the work of Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins, etc.).
The first-ever freely improvised solo saxophone album was Anthony 
Braxton's For Alto. Recorded in 1969, less than a decade after the 
term free jazz was coined (by Ornette Coleman, with the 1960 
release of Free Jazz), For Mo was remarkably ahead of its time. 
Though free improvisation was well-established by the time of its 
recording, the jazz aesthetic stilt weighed heavily in the hearts of 
most free musicians. For Mo adheres far less to jazz influence, and 
is therefore a more pure free association.
European saxophone players Peter Brtozmann and Evan Parker 
experimented with solo improvisation a few years later and yielded 
some of the most challenging and incredible albums of all time Solo 
and Saxophone Solos, respectively. More removed from the jazz 
setting, both musicians bring the saxophone to its sonic limits and 
further expose the enrichment that lies at the intersection of free 
associations great power and the astounding expressive quality of 
the saxophone.

Its a dogs life
Photographer shows large-scale Polaroids at Silver Eye
Heya! Try shaking these like a Polaroid picture. They're 
internationally acclaimed artist William Wegman's largescale Polaroid photographs of Weimaraner dogs. Wegman's 
28 pieces, all completely focused on Weimaraners, stir up a 
mixture of jovial feelings. Wegmans exhibit of overlarged 
photos are on view through November 4 at the Silver Eye. 
Center for Photography in conjunction with Animal Friends, 
a Pittsburgh organization focused on finding loving homes for 
cats and dogs.
Wegmans exhibit captures and portrays Weimaraner dogs 
assuming human responsibilities. The exhibit features dogs 
on rollerblades, dogs exercising, dogs kayaking, dogs in 
costume, dogs watching movies, dogs in makeup  dogs 
exploring a whole spectrum of human activities and emotions. 
Looking at these large-scale Polaroid picture generates a 
deeper appreciation of how a dog truly can be a mans best 
friend.
When most of us think of a photograph, we think of the 
possibility of having an infinite number of prints. What is so 
special about these 20-by-24-inch photographs by William 
Wegman is that there is only one print," said Linda BenedictJones, executive director of the Silver Eye. When Polaroid 
calls them unique prints, or 'one-of-a-kind' prints, they 
mean that they are good, but they also mean that there are no 
others.... There is no negative with a Polaroid 20-inch-by-24- 
inch print, and so the positive, or the print, is, by definition, 
the only image that exists. So if the public has seen Wegman 
prints before, chances are they have never seen these 
because these have never before come to Pittsburgh."
In 1979, Polaroid invited Wegman to participate in The 
Polaroid Collection. Wegman used Polaroid cameras that 
weighed 235 pounds, were five feet tall, and took 70 seconds 
to develop a photo; Wegman described the cameras he used 
as a mesh between a refrigerator and a cello. As a part of the 
invitation, Wegman donated one of his pieces to add to the 
national Polaroid collection.
Wegman's style appeals to a wide range of audiences, from 
children to art critics. Amanda Bloomfield, the membership 
and public relations coordinator of the Silver Eye gallery, said, 
The gallery is wonderful because as visitors browse, they 
laugh. It catches the attention of so many people: museumgoers, dog lovers, the young, the old, and anyone just walking 
down the street." The gallery maintained a lighthearted 
nature, and it was refreshing to watch families and friends 
laughing, pointing, and explaining the humor behind each 
piece.
Every photo in the exhibit has its own little joke. In some of 
the photos the humor is very obvious: Wegmans dog Man 
Ray in rollerskates (Rolleramer, 1987); a physically-fit dog 
on a fitness bicycle (Stud," 2000). In other photographs the 
humor is more subtle: in Faye and Andrea" you have to
look closer to realize that Faye, the dog, has fake eyelashes; 
in the piece "Mantle, the two dogs are hidden in the 
stonework such that if you dont look closely, you may miss 
them. The hidden elements in the photographs provide for a 
photographic adventure full of twists and quirks.
Wegman uses his dogs Man Ray and Faye, and Faye's 
puppies Battina, Crooky, and Chundo, as well as Battina's son 
Chip, Chip's sons Bobbin and Candy, and Bobbins daughter 
as models in his pieces. Wegman's dogs are his muses, his 
models; he knows what his dogs are and arent comfortable 
doing, and one of Wegmans primary concerns is making sure 
that his dogs feel comfortable with each shot.
Wegman started out as just a painter, but has now achieved 
international recognition through his experimentation with 
photographs, paintings, drawings, and videos that have been 
in shows and galleries worldwide; art and animal fanatics 
alike can appreciate any of Wegman's work. On Wednesday, 
October 11, from 7 to 8:30 p.m., there will be a screening of 
Wegmans video art. Its definitely worth checking out, but be 
sure to bring a can of dog or cat food in order to be registered 
for a chance to win a book of Wegmans work  all animal 
food (and proceeds) will be donated to Animal Friends.

Inside the lives of the Presidents wives
New exhibit highlights the fashion and politics of famous first ladies
"Dolley Madison,  Edith Mayo quickly replies when asked who 
her favorite first lady is. Mayo is the curator of First Ladies: 
Political Role & Public Image, an exhibit currently showing at 
the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. I love 
Dolley Madison because she is such a larger-than-life figure, 
Mayo said. Judging by the petite size of Madison's peach silk 
brocade dress on display, however, one might beg to differ. 
First Ladies displays several striking, delicate dresses worn 
by the likes of Jackie 0., Mamie Eisenhower, and Eleanor 
Roosevelt.
In addition to the glamor of the dresses, the exhibit shows 
that first ladies are much more than fashion icons. "There's a 
real person behind the gown, and the gowns are symbolic of 
the [first lady's] role," Mayo explained.
The myriad roles played by first ladies throughout the 
centuries have ranged from party hostess to supportive wife 
to international diplomat. The first ladies detailed in the 
exhibit are "women who influenced fashion and culture, 
according to the exhibit's press release. Ladies like Madison 
and Louisa Catherine Adams were famed for the social events 
they planned in order to gamer support for their husbands. 
Mayos fondness for Madison stems from the way the first lady 
"blended entertainment and politics" so skillfully, paving the 
way for future first ladies to become powerful social figures 
recognizable nationwide for their class, political power, and 
cultural prowess.
The exhibit itself is constructed in an intimate, introspective 
way. Visitors meander their way through solid glass cases
that frame the artifacts of these powerful women in a dimly 
lit room. The room itself fosters an air of exclusivity and 
retrospective inquisition as to the femininity of the most 
distinguished first ladies and how they used their role as a 
wife to voice their own concerns. Housing the most pertinent 
items that made these women famous, First Ladies proves 
that these unique women have found the fine line between 
political activism and cultural domesticity and have exploited 
it to amplify their (and their husbands) social power.
As stated by Rosalynn Carter, first lady to President Jimmy 
Carter, A first lady is in a position to know the needs of the 
country and do something about them. It would be a shame 
not to take full advantage of that power. Out of this idea 
came such icons as Pat for First Lady" signs during Richard 
Nixons presidential campaign and Mamie-Pat" buttons 
when Mamie Eisenhower and Pat Nixons husbands were 
running for President and Vice-President, respectively  not 
to mention Nancy Reagans exquisite china for entertaining 
guests.
First Ladies demonstrates the evolution of the roles of first 
ladies throughout American history. They are hostesses. They 
are advocates for educational reform. They are campaign 
partners and policymakers. The increasing social and 
political power of first ladies parallels that of the ever-dynamic 
American woman, insists the exhibits curator. Mayo said that 
First Ladies maintains that these iconic women "define our 
expectation of the American woman.
The exhibit comes to the Heinz History Center from the
Smithsonian Institutions American History Museum in 
Washington, D.C., which will be closed over the next two 
years for major renovations. The exhibit is interesting not only 
for its antiquated dresses (such as Mamie Eisenhowers pink 
1958 pina cloth gown or Jacqueline Kennedys gray silk dress 
and matching jacket), but also for seeing how these items 
ensured the high cultural status needed to make the first 
ladies (and their gowns and china) infamous.
The First Ladies exhibit opened on Friday, September 22, and 
will be open through February 2007.
In conjunction with the First Ladies exhibit, the Senator John 
Heinz History Center will be hosting the Women in Leadership 
and Business Lecture Series. Local women will be speaking 
about their leadership throughout this winter, with dates to 
be announced. The Heinz History Center will also be offering 
Afternoon Tea with the First Ladies" seven days a week. For 
$25, patrons will be served full tea complete with pastries and 
unique tea sandwiches from October through February.

about its timing. Granted, this 
movie didnt cause the stir that 
World Trade Center did, but with 
its smaller scale and lack of Oliver

better movie. Unlike WTC, which 
followed two police officers turned

Hilary Masters: E
At age 78, Carnegie Mellon profess
Baker Hall is one of the most heavily traveled buildings on 
campus, but it still contains hidden treasures. Walk up the 
building's front staircase, and you may find a cozy nook known 
as the Gladys Schmidt Creative Writing Center, home to the 
legendary Hilary Masters. Masters recently published his 
latest novel, Elegy for Sam Emerson. Along with readings at 
Joseph Beth Booksellers and The Mattress Factory, Masters' 
schedule for the past week also included teaching his usual 
classes at Carnegie Mellon. So what makes an author? 
Delve into the life of Hilary Masters to discover the origin 
of a masterpiece.
Masters was born in 1928 in Kansas City, Mo., and was 
raised by his grandparents. In the late 1940s, he served 
as a naval correspondent but was honorably discharged 
after some time. His writing career was well on its 
way when he began his first teaching job, a two-year 
stint at Drake University as a visiting writer. Since 
then, he has resided in North Carolina, Ohio, Denver, 
New York City, and even taught in Finland. In total, 
Masters has published eight novels, two short story 
collections, and a memoir. He has now settled 
down in Pittsburgh, and vowed never to leave. 
Despite the many complaints about weather and 
boredom that students here routinely dole out, 
Masters said he "fell in love. -
His love for this city is the reason that his 
novel, which he lovingly calls Sam, takes 
place here. In fact, he adores this place so 
much that, he said, "this is not the only book 
Ive written that takes place in Pittsburgh. 
His love for Pittsburgh stems from his view 
of its people. To Masters, the energy of the 
Pittsburgh people brings back memories 
of the Big Apple.
For his novel, Masters chose his favorite 
spot, Mount Washington, as the main 
location. Masters sets the story in 
Sams Place, a restaurant that looks 
out over the three rivers area and was 
built by a protg of Frank Lloyd 
Wright, whom Masters admires 
because of Fallingwater, a house 
that the architect built for the 
wealthy Kaufmann family. Of 
course, Masters does not rely on 
setting to create his story. When 
asked about his writing process, 
he said, "I start out with a 
character. Most of my novels 
come to me in terms of the 
protagonist. I find out what he 
wants, what the plot is, and I 
go on from there."
In the case of Elegy for Sam 
Emerson, the protagonist 
is Sam, the owner of Sams 
Place. Sams mother, nearly

100 years old, has just died. She was a star of sorts in her day, 
and Sams father was a war photographer, always traveling, 
so Sam was raised mostly by his great-aunt. His desire, now 
that his mother has died, is to decide what to do with her 
ashes. This deliberation, Masters said, "fuels the novel. 
Partnered with this trouble, the author makes Sam a more 
dynamic character by giving him a lady love: "He wants to 
marry her, but shes not sure about it."
Masters often likes to formulate his plots around social 
issues, from race to politics. Elegy for Sam Emerson fits 
that bill. Masters said that the central message in Sam" is 
simple: "We must love each other or die. He also said that 
his new novel is different from his previous ones. "The voice 
has a more compassionate sound. Some of my former novels 
were slightly cynical, he said.
In the novel, Masters also fiddles with the ambiguous 
concept of time. Elegy for Sam Emerson skips from the 1940s 
to the '50s and then to the '90s. "I like to move around, 
said Masters. Most novels these days tend to follow similar 
patterns, with time having no bounds. Masters asked,
"What else do you write about? I mean, what else do you 
really know about [but the past]?" However, he takes it one 
step further by writing every passage in the present tense, 
whether the passage has come from Sams earlier days or 
more recent times. After much prying as to why he chose 
to format the novel in that manner, the inner philosopher 
of Hilary Masters came out. Masters said that there is no 
definitive present tense. The past is actually going on in 
the present. As you and I are sitting here talking, it's over. 
He quoted Saint Augustine: The past is all we know of 
the present." Masters believes that we judge our present 
experiences with those of our past, so as he was writing 
of the events in the past, Sam was experiencing them in 
present tense within his memory.
What compelled Hilary Masters to become a writer? That is 
like nine questions in one, he chuckled. He was inspired by 
other authors, especially Daniel Defoe, who wrote Robinson 
Crusoe. He also was a voracious reader as a child. Masters' 
desire was to use literature as a vessel for storytelling. He 
started out with poetry, but, quoting William Faulkner, 
Masters said: All novelists are failed poets." Having 
transitioned to novels, he said, I realized I couldnt write 
poetry; I needed more space.
The criticism that comes with being a writer does not faze 
Masters. Unfair criticism bothers me, he said. "People who 
use that to take out a grudge  that bothers me. However, 
he does appreciate those who carry valid arguments. He 
said, "You can tell when people have read you seriously [and] 
thoroughly and still have some doubts.
Understanding how he deals with heavy criticism is one 
thing, but a true test of a man's character is to see his 
reaction when given an award. Though he has received 
numerous awards, such as the 2003 Award for Literature 
from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, he said 
the true award is to have the approval of ones peers." He 
cares little for how the public receives his work: I have
an audience that I do write for. Half of them are 
imaginary."
Part of the real-life half of Hilary Masters' immediate 
audience is his students. At Carnegie Mellon, he 
teaches Personal Essay and Survey of Forms: Fiction. 
His take on the personal essay is accredited to Michel 
de Montaigne, whom he admires greatly. It may seem 
as though juggling two careers would require some 
impingement of one on the other. However, Masters 
advocates this lifestyle. I came to teaching late. I 
never went to an MFA [Masters of Fine Arts] program. 
My writing agenda and routine were established 
before I started. Now that he is a teacher as well, he 
chooses to write in the mornings and teach in the 
afternoons. "Im very happy here. I think it's great that 
universities have become the new patrons of the arts. 
Masters said that he loves Carnegie Mellon because 
the school allows him to follow his passion and share it 
with the students here.
Masters students are treated uniquely. He does 
not demand that they follow his path. If they want 
to write, I hope they succeed," he said. Yet, in the 
classroom, he does have certain demands of their 
writing. I look for exactness in language and if things 
are genuine. He looks for similar aspects in other 
peoples writing: I value the craft [writing], the ability 
to tell the story, he said.
Michael Szczerban, one of Masters students and 
editor-in-chief of The Oakland Review, a creative 
writing journal, appreciates the professors honesty 
in the classroom. He said that Masters' criticism is 
pointed and accurate and his praise is hard-earned." 
Masters does not change your writing, Szczerban said; 
"[the] work is your own to make better.
Szczerban has read some of his professors work, too. 
He said, His [Masters'] prose is elegant and beautiful, 
at times complex. I'm amazed that [he can] do that 
dance with language and in the next sentence be 
able to reseat the reader with a blunt sentence. In 
particular, Szczerban raves about Masters memoir, 
Last Stands: Notes from Memory. It is in this work that 
readers find out that the late writer Edgar Lee Masters 
was also Hilary Masters' father, though he had little 
impact on Masters' current career.
Though he was preoccupied with Elegy for Sam 
Emerson for the past three years, he is already 
thinking of his next work. It kind of is in my mind. I 
cannot work on more than one thing at a time, [so] I 
have been carrying this long story in my head." This 
new novel will not affect his teaching career, however. 
Those that have retired miss the classroom," he vows, 
I am never going to retire.

New releases join music scene with gusto
Thom, Kearney, Nevertheless, and Lostprophets release promising albums
Sandi Thom
Smile... It Confuses People
Well, I was no doubt confused by the music of Sandi Thom. 
Her biography boasts of music that is a fusion of soul and folk, 
but I must have missed the soul portion of her debut album, 
which is supposedly inspired by legendary singers like Stevie 
Wonder and Aretha Franklin.
I think not. Sandi Thom's songs were definitely folky, 
reminding me of a semi-punk-rock-country genre that doesn't 
exist. Think KT Tunstall meets Carrie Underwood. It was 
only her music that didnt impress me, though; I will praise 
Thom's voice  her vocal talent cannot be denied, as strong 
and fervent as it is. Her high and enthusiastic voice surprised 
me: From the cover of her album and the titles of her songs, I 
expected to hear the voice of a grunge rock type. The material 
of one of her songs is somewhat admirable: In "I Wish I was 
a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in my Hair), Thom sings about 
the troubles of the world today, revealing her preference for a 
simpler time "[when] music really mattered and when radio 
was king ... and the media couldnt buy your soul. Singing 
critically about her own industry, she definitely has a point. It 
isn't necessarily hypocrisy, just an interesting take on things.
You may want to delve into Thoms series of folksy ballads 
if you like indie/folk singer Adam Gardner (who claims to 
sound like both Jack Johnson and Damien Rice; you choose).
I get the impression that Thoms music isnt universal  not 
everybody will enjoy it. In the end, though, she has some 
potential and a great voice.
Mat Kearney
Nothing Left to Lose
Mat Kearneys debut  as far as major record labels go
 is an excellent compilation of songs that a lot of different
audiences could relate to. Delivering a synthesis of pop 
and hip-hop, a little bit of rock, and a smidgen of folk, the 
songwriter serenades you not only with his memorable 
voice, but also with his guitar skills and bits of spoken word. 
He credits his musical interests to artists from Miles Davis 
and Billie Holiday to De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest. 
Kearneys admiration of these artists fueled his interest in 
blending speech and poetry in his writing. He produces 
a style that cannot be categorized by any one genre, only 
described.
And yet, there isn't a track on Nothing Left to Lose that is 
amazingly incredible. Despite the general likeability of the CD, 
none of the songs manage to stand out. Not to be mistaken, 
the songs and the material arent horrible  Kearneys tracks 
are good; they simply are not grand or superb.
Kearney's voice is Chris Martin-esque, but a little more 
grungy and disheveled. The Fray, Coldplay, and John Mayer 
are similar to various aspects of Kearneys style: You may like 
Kearney's music if you like any of those artists. This album is 
definitely worth a listen.
Nevertheless
Live Like We're Alive
1\im on this pop/rock CD and hear all other pop/rock CDs: 
Daphne Loves Derby, Fall Out Boy, etc. If you are a fan of these 
artists or similar artists you may be fond of Nevertheless, a

Members Josh Pearson (lead vocals/guitar), AJ Cheek (lead

vocals), Adam Wann (bass), and Adam Rowe (drums) are 
the cast of this brand new band. Their newest album is an 
anthology of emotion-ridden songs like "Lover" and "Let It 
Fall, which describe the profound sentiments associated
with love, faith, and life. It is true that underneath the exterior 
of what may come off as another faceless emo/punk/pop/rock 
band, Nevertheless has something more to offer: content.
The lyrics go beyond the typical stereotype of heartbreak and 
sadness, which sets them apart many similar bands. Theirs is 
a good effort and a decent album.
Lostprophets
Liberation Transmission
Intense. Thats the first word that came to mind in listening 
to Lostprophets new album, Liberation Transmission. The 
first track, called Everyday Combat, certainly gave the 
impression that the rest of the CD was going to be great. The 
combination of indie and comparitively harder rock works 
well for the boys of Lostprophets, which includes Ian Watkins, 
Jamie Oliver, Lee Gaze, Mike Lewis, and Stuart Richardson. 
Titles of the tracks, such as "Can't Stop, Gotta Date With 
Hate," make you laugh out loud in amusement, and, in some 
tragic way, you cant help but to relate to the lyrics.
Liberation Transmission is an album that feels out of place in 
its genre. Having an interest in rock bands such as 311, Linkin 
Park, or Hoobastank might leave you open to this alternative 
metal/rock band. The style and presentation of this band are 
both somewhat unique; however some of their songs seem all 
too familiar. Despite this, this album offers entertainment and 
enjoyment  cheek it out.

Although youll say that you saw it coming, youll be totally blindsided 
when a classmate offers to paint that portrait you always wanted of you 
and your hot Asian friend for only 50 bucks. Do yourself a favor and 
show up wearing pants.
Lucky you! After last weeks disaster, things will be looking up these 
next few days. However, you probably want to avoid next week entirely. 
Have you gotten your passport re-registered? Because now would be 
a good time to think about it.

You forgot to go to bed before 4 a.m. again and you missed all your 
classes. Its a real shame cause that person youve had your eye on 
really wanted to talk to you today because they finally realized how cool 
you were. Now theyre dating that jerk that you hate.

A cartoon character will emerge from your television at some point in the 
next five days while youre sleeping and replace all of your underwear 
with visually identical garments that have been worn by really, really fat 
truckers. On the plus side, someone found your missing wallet. I hope 
you didn't want that back.
Right now you have a lot of questions. Im guessing thats why youre 
reading the Horoscope section instead of finishing your 212 homework. 
You do know that its due tomorrow, right?
Avoid anyone wearing the color red for the next week. One of them 
will be a matador, and he will totally make you look like an idiot in front 
of that really cute homeless dude from Kohls and youll be way too 
embarrassed to ever go to the museum again. Also, try to cut back on 
the caramel banana ice cream; Id like to have some next time.
Let it go. Stop using Mulberry already. Carnegie Mellon no longer 
supports it and you need to stop.
Hey, I totally saw you crying the other day behind the meat locker. Is 
everything cool? I know things have been crazy lately, but you need to 
remember that people out there care about you. Also, can I borrow five 
bucks?
Try not to read anything in the bathroom today. Theres a good chance 
youll get a nasty paper cut, and you already have enough to deal 
with.
You'll never feel alone again after they graft your girlfriend to your 
circulatory and endocrine system. But itll be super, super awkward 
when she goes for her gynecology exam. Did you forget it was this 
week? Because youre gonna feel really out of place.vr-liMi - i lliiiit
The solution to your problems is simple: Stop challenging your mom to 
knife fights. Pretty straightforward, really, when you think about it.

zombie parade
It's a George Romero film gone horribly wrong. Zombie enthusiasts stumbled down South Side's Carson Street in 
search of a good time... and brains... during the First Annual Zombie Walk 2006. Don't worry, Pittsburgh hasn't lost 
its mind. Several other cities, including Toronto, San Francisco, and Atlanta, have been doing this for years.
