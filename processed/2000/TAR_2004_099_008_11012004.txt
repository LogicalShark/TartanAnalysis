Kerry campaign makes stop at CMU
Michael Moore lectures on campus
by Amanda Flynn
Staffwriter
Michael Moore, filmmaker 
and author, came to Carnegie 
Mellon University on Tuesday 
to address a crowd of stu
dents and faculty in Wiegand 
Gymnasium.
Moores speech was preceded 
by two guest speakers. Dante 
Zappala, whose brother was 
killed in Iraq, opened the after
noons event. Zappalas brother, 
Sergeant Sherwood Baker, was 
killed in Iraq exactly six months 
before Tuesdays speech. 
Zappala explained that he was 
wary of his brothers deploy
ment to Iraq, but Baker insisted 
he would be fine. Unfortunately, 
Baker was one of two soldiers 
killed when a building exploded 
in Baghdad. Zappala claimed 
that my brother died trying 
to make an honest man out of 
George Bush.
Nancy Lession, founder of 
the Military Families Speak 
Out organization, followed 
Zappalas speech. Lession, 
whose stepson was also killed 
in Iraq, protested her stepsons 
deployment to Kosovo and later 
to Iraq. She declared that my 
husband and I saw no good rea
son to be in Iraq as she feels 
that the war in Iraq is a war 
of aggression ... a war about oil 
markets and empire building. 
The Military Families Speak Out 
organization has grown since 
its formation in November 2002 
and currently has 1800 families 
involved.
After Lessions speech, 
Michael Moore took the stage. 
Moore, author of Will They 
Ever Trust Us Again? Letters 
from the War Zone and Dude, 
Wheres My Country?, began 
by addressing the Republicans 
in the crowd. Moore praised 
Republicans as hardworking 
and industrious before assert
ing that they have to work hard, 
since America is no longer a 
country that subscribes to 
their beliefs. However, Moore 
assured Republicans that we 
will not treat minorities the way

by Mark Egerman
Executive Officer
The Tartan: Weve been 
talking a lot about the elec
tion on November 2, lets talk 
about November 3. If Kerry 
wins, Bush becomes one of 
the youngest and most popu
lar ex-Presidents ever. About 
half this country very much 
likes him. What can progres
sives do to ensure that a Kerry 
victory actually results in a 
progressive victory and does 
not result in a lot of backlash
Moore: And I would assume 
that a certain amount of that 
backlash would be directed 
toward me?
The Tartan: If you would 
like to assume as much.
Moore: I wouldnt actu
ally. [LAUGHTER] I was 
hoping for some peace and 
quiet. I am hoping that the 
Republicans are not a venge
ful people. Thats a very good

CMU may 
open branch 
in Australia
by Mark Egerman
Executive Officer
Carnegie Mellon has begun a 
process to create an academic 
presence in Australia. On Friday, 
South Australian Premier Mike 
Rann signed a Heads of Agreement 
with CMU and iCarnegie, a sub
sidy of the University. The agree
ment is one step towards the cre
ation of a fourth University branch 
in Adelaide, which would be the 
first private university in South 
Australia.
If this new university is to be 
built, Carnegie Mellon will likely 
offer or assist in specialized post-' 
graduate programs in computer 
science, information technology, 
and public administration, accord
ing to a press release issued by the 
University. There is also interest 
in creating programs in business 
and trade; as a result, the Heinz 
School and iCarnegie are consid
ered ideal choices for the branch. 
iCarnegie is an educational affili
ate of Carnegie Mellon that oper
ates in a number of countries, 
offering software development 
programs.
Carnegie Mellon has already 
extended its programs to other 
countries. In addition to the 
recently opened Qatar campus, 
Carnegie Mellon offers programs 
in Germany, England, Taiwan, 
Greece, and Singapore. Whereas 
the Qatar campus is an entire 
campus where Carnegie Mellon 
offers a four-year undergraduate 
education, Carnegie Mellon plays 
significantly reduced roles at the 
other campuses. At the Singapore 
Management University, Carnegie 
Mellon provides assistance
but does not offer courses or a 
degree.
According to University Public 
Relations Director Teresa Sokol 
Thomas, this potential project will 
be more similar to the latter pro
grams than the former.

Condoleezza Rice speaks 
on international issues
by Louisa Kinoshi
Junior Staffwriter
On October 21, Condoleezza 
Rice spoke to the students and 
staff of the International Relations 
program in Kresge Theatre. Rice, 
assistant to the President for 
National Security Affairs, gave a 
lecture on the role of the col
lege graduate in public service 
and society. The lecture was 
sponsored by the International 
Relations Program.
The program began with an
introduction by University 
President Jared L. Cohon. He 
spoke of the security challeng
es posed by September 11 and 
how Rice has helped the nation 
comprehend those challenges. 
Carnegie Mellon must be more 
active in the world as a global 
institution and must understand 
and impact international issues, 
said Cohon. He then described 
Carnegie Mellons Qatar cam
pus as a world class universi
ty in the Persian Gulf region ...

Delta Tau Delta closes by 
order of national chapter
by J.T. Trollman
Photo Editor
This Sunday, the Carnegie 
Mellon chapter of the Delta Tau 
Delta fraternity officially closed 
due to orders from its national 
chapter. According to national 
Director of Communications 
Jason Young, the decision was 
made due to the chapters viola
tion of risk management poli

The fraternitys executive vice 
president, James B. Russell, was
quoted in an official Delta Tau 
Delta press release as saying 
that the chapter demonstrated 
its inability to effectively man
age operations and abide by 
Fraternity policies, practices, and 
expectations.
The decision to close the chap
ter comes after a semester punc

incident in September in which a 
DTD member accidentally posted

formed Carnegie Mellons cam

Library October 20 deemed

two weeks remaining before
the November 2 elections, 
Democratic Presidential candi
date John Kerry brought his cam
paign to Pittsburgh to rally what 
Congressman Mike Doyle called 
one of the largest crowds weve 
ever seen in this great city.
Are you ready for new lead
ership? Kerry asked the crowd 
that packed the CMU campus 
from CFA lawn to the mall. Well, 
help is on the way.
The Massachusetts Senator 
opened his speech by directly 
addressing Pittsburgh citizens. 
Its great to be back to the city 
that I visit a little more frequent

going to be the home of the next 
First Lady of the United States of 
America,' he said, referring to 
his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry.
According to The New York 
Times, Heinz Kerry was under
fire that day after making a com
ment about current First Lady 
Laura Bushs never holding a 
real job. Bush was a teacher 
before becoming First Lady. 
Heinz Kerry later apologized 
for the remark. In his speech at

Erik Michaels-Ober
; Tomorrow is Election Day. I encour
age you to set aside some time to vote 
between 7 am, when the polls open, 
and 8 pm, when they close. Do not let 
inclement weather stop you from voting. 
The opportunity to have a direct impact 
on the future of America does not come 
often. Please make the most of it.
In addition to voting in Presidential and 
Congressional races, voters in Allegheny 
County will be electing representatives to 
the Pennsylvania State Senate and House 
of Representatives. Pennsylvania voters 
will also be choosing a state attorney 
general, auditor general, and treasurer.
While state races may not get as much 
media coverage as national races, they 
are still important. One state issue that 
affects students is public transportation.
State funding cuts have caused the Port 
Authority to propose elimination of all 
night and weekend bus service. These 
cuts could -take place as early as March. 
Our student government is working to 
lobby the state government to provide 
adequate funding for public transporta
tion, but this will only be effective if 
students vote in large numbers.
Student government has organized 
shuttles to polling places that will be run
ning all day from the University Center 
turnaround; however, for many of you it 
will be more convenient to walk to your 
polling place.
Offer to walk with your friends to the 
polls or give them a ride if you have a 
car. If you are not sure where to vote, call 
the Allegheny County Elections Division 
at (412) 350-4500 or look it up at www. 
everybodyvote. com.
If tomorrow will be your first time 
voting or if you will be voting in a new
election district, you will be required to 
provide proof of identification to vote; 
your student identification card will be 
sufficient.
It is important to know your rights as 
a voter. If you are in line before the polls 
close, you have a right to vote, no matter 
how long it takes. If you believe you are 
registered to vote but your name does 
not appear on the official voter list, you 
have the right to cast a provisional ballot.  
If you are confused about anything while 
voting, feel free to ask questions of the 
poll workers.
After you vote, you can watch the results 
come in at student governments Election 
Returns Party in Rangos Ballroom. It 
begins at 6 pm, and performers includ
ing Adam Edison, The Girls, Off The Top, 
Adam Evil and the Outside Royalty, Anna 
Vogelzang, The No Parking Players, The 
Originals, and Soundbytes will be on 
stage as the election results are televised
on large screens.
This will also be the last week of free 
newspapers through the Collegiate 
Readership Program. Student govern
ment decided to pilot the program dur
ing the month leading up to election so 
that students could be more informed 
about political issues.
I have received a great deal of feed
back about the program, almost all of 
which has been positive. Many students 
expressed a desire for the program to 
continue.
Unfortunately, Student Government 
does not currently have the funds neces
sary to continue the program, but we are 
considering raising these funds through 
a new student fee of between $4 and $6 
per year.
Please send your thoughts about the pro
posed newspaper fee or anything else to 
concerns@andrew.cmu.edu.

Adam Greenberg
While this weeks Forum sec
tion contains several independent 
endorsements of political candidates, 
one thing that is missing is an official 
partisan endorsement by the paper. 
While it is common practice for news
papers to officially give their opinions 
on candidates and elections, there are 
several reasons one is missing from 
our pages today.
The first is purely legal and proce
dural. Though The Tartan generates 
most of its operating budget from 
advertising, it is also funded in part 
by Carnegie Mellons student activi
ties fee. Funded organizations are not 
permitted to have political motives 
for existing, and while a single edito
rial could not be the papers raison 
dtre, we decided that splitting hairs 
over legality was unnecessary and 
inappropriate.
The major reason for avoiding an 
official endorsement was the content 
The Tartan could provide its readers 
instead. In place of an endorsement 
editorial, we have printed two oth
ers we hope are more applicable to 
our (largely) student readership. In 
fact, this weeks Forum section is one 
of the largest The Tartan has ever 
printed.
In it youll find pieces by members 
of our staff on the subject of the 
election and on other important cur
rent issues. Additionally, youll see 
several pieces in a slightly different 
format written by non-members ol 
the Tartan staff.
These are so-called indepen
dent submissions, often printed in 
The Tartan as Say What? pieces 
in the Forum section. The Tartan 
officially defines its purpose to be 
partly a forum for opinions from the 
University community. We take that 
responsibility seriously and open our 
pages to students and other members 
of the University community in sev
eral ways.
As a former Forum Editor of The. 
Tartan, I advocate the most obvious ol 
these: joining our staff. Were always 
looking for new members and we 
especially appreciate those who want 
to add to the papers analysis sec
tion. Short of that, another way is the 
aforementioned independent sub
mission. The Tartans constitution 
prohibits new staff members from 
writing opinion articles or reviews. 
In order to write for Forum, a writer 
must first contribute to four issues 
and attend a training session. But 
writers may also contribute without 
joining our staff.
In order to keep students from 
abusing the independent submis
sion process, we limit each student 
to one submission per semester. We 
also accept pieces from non-students, 
who may contribute as many as they 
desire.
To contribute, contact our Forum 
Editor (forum@thetartan.org) or 
me, The Tartans Editor-in-Chief 
(editor@thetartan.org), about writ
ing an opinion piece for us. Either of 
us can help guide your topic and give 
you tips on writing a good argument, 
getting it sized, and writing in official 
Tartan style. The Tartan reserves the  
right to edit or reject a piece because 
of size, relevancy, or appropriateness,. 
but our editors mucfy prefer work
ing with writers for a product that' 
pleases all parties.
Over the last several years, The 
Tartan has printed submissions by 
leaders of student organizations, stu
dent government officials, and a state
wide political candidate. Through the 
work of this semesters staff, the num
ber of these outside contributors has 
been steadily growing, and I applaud 
their efforts; it had been one of the 
elusive pieces of The Tartans mission - 
to ramp up our use as a public forum..
This week we hope to use all the 
myriad opinions of members of our 
staff and those who chose to submit 
independently to replace an endorse
ment. They give both sides of the 
issue and insightful reasoning for 
their beliefs.
This far outperforms the one-sided 
unsigned editorial that we could have 
printed.

Mudge House moderates 
mock election for students
by Mark Egerman
Executive Officer
Students went to the polls the 
past week in a mock election spon
sored by Mudge House. The elec
tion employed an electoral college 
where each dormitory received a 
proportional number of electoral 
votes. There were no accusations 
of voter fraud and the online vot
ing system, created by students, 
worked faultlessly. Mudge RA 
Dean Eberhardt, a Masters stu
dent in Industrial Administration, 
and one of the organizers of the 
event, hoped that the vote will 
raise the political awareness of 
the undergraduate population. 
In addition to raising awareness, 
Eberhardt wanted for the poll to 
increase interest in the student 
body in the election itself and get 
more people to vote.
In order to increase voter turn
out, members of the Mudge RA 
staff wore T-shirts advertising 
the event and tabled outside of 
Doherty to collect votes. Other 
RAs advertised the event to their 
residents and individual student 
groups sent out e-mails.
All students were eligible to 
vote, whether or not they were 
citizens or 18. According to Mud ge 
housefellow Niloo Sobhani, We 
hope that a mock election can 
become a tradition on campus 
every four years. I think its impor
tant to give our international stu
dents and students who are not 
old enough to vote a voice. She 
credited her RAs and CA for work
ing to encourage student voting. 
Furthermore, she noted that 
many students inquired about the 
results while the voting was still

. Health services warns of severe shortage of flu shots
by Bradford L. Yankiver
Assistant Photo Editor
Health Services has only 330 
flu vaccines this year to innoculate students and faculty members 
who are in the high-risk category, 
as well as all campus police offi
cers.
Aventis, the company from 
which Carnegie Mellon University 
purchases its vaccines, assured 
Health Services that it would 
receive all 1300 flu shots it ordered 
last spring, even after the pres
ence of a shortage came to light. 
On October 18, Aventis informed 
Health Services that it would redi
rect some of the vaccines previ
ously allotted to CMU.
Biotech company Chiron was 
to provide around 48 million 
doses of the vaccine Fluvirin to 
U.S. health care providers. In a 
statement issued October 15 the 
FDA announced that None of the
influenza vaccine manufactured 
by the Chiron Corporation for the 
U.S. market is safe for use. Chiron 
vaccines would have accounted 
for about half of the U.S. supply.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
reported that UPMC Health 
Systems ordered 145,000 flu 
shots from Chiron; the health care 
group is left with 5000 it ordered 
from Aventis.
Allegheny County has received 
a total of 15,600 shots, the last 
of which were administered last 
Tuesday, leaving thousands of 
people in the high-risk population, 
among them children and senior 
citizens, unprotected.
Heath Services had already 
received and administered 300 
flu shots when the possibil
ity of a shortage became known. 
Altogether, the community is 670 
doses short of what it expected.
Healthy students and faculty 
need not overly concern them
selves about the flu, according to
Director of Heath Services Anita 
Barkin.
People have been so anxietyridden since the government 
announced the shortage, said 
Barkin. We want to reassure peo
ple in the low-risk category that 
while the flu is an inconvenience 
... healthy people recover.
The Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention is advertising, 
Be a germ stopper. The CDCs 
flu-prevention website (www.cdc. 
gov/germstopper) makes a number 
of suggestions: cover your mouth 
when you sneeze or cough; wash 
your hands frequently; use the 
pump hand-sanitizers available 
in clusters before and after using 
a computer; avoid touching your 
eyes, nose, or mouth after touch
ing environmental surfaces such 
as keyboards, doorknobs, and tele
phones; and wipe such surfaces 
with a cleaning solution regularly.
Medication such as Tamiflu, 
available from Health Services,
can lessen the severity of illness if 
a patient seeks treatment withinJ 
24-48 hours of the onset of symptoms.
Any students experiencing the., 
sudden onset of a fever greater., 
than 100 degrees with accompanying cough, sore throat, or  
body aches should contact HealthServices or their health care pro
viders. Students can get disposable, 
thermometers from their resident,, 
assistant or from Heath Services.
Students who become ill should  
stay at home to avoid spread- , 
ing the virus, says Barkin, who., 
is confident that professors will 
be accommodating. Also, to pre
vent students from infecting their 
roommates, Health Services may 
prescribe Tamiflu to healthy stu
dents as a preventative measure.
Barkin says Health Services will 
stay in contact with U.S. regula
tors and with Aventis in hopes 
that more vaccines will become 
available.
Film Fahrenhype 9/11 and student forumchallenge alleged liberal bias on campus
by Michelle Bova
Staffwriter
Right On, a recently devel
oped conservative campus orga-' 
nization, showed a screening of 
Fahrenhype 9/11 last Wednesday 
night in Doherty Hall in response 
to filmmaker Michael Moores 
appearance on campus. The group 
decided to bring the film to cam
pus prior to Moores first sched
uled appearance on October 6.
Fahrenhype 9/11 is a docu
mentary that rebuts many of the 
anti-Bush themes of Moores film 
Fahrenheit 9/11 and interviews 
myriad political figures and oth
ers in the public eye, including Ed 
Koch and Ron Silver. The film is 
unrated and was directed by Alan 
Peterson.
The film alleges that in sev
eral instances in Fahrenheit 9/11 
Moore used incorrect informa
tion. Interviewees state that 
Moore took information out 
of context, such as the famous 
scene from Fahrenheit 9/11 
when President George W. Bush 
states he is among the haves 
and the have mores. According
to Fahrenhype 9/11, this footage 
was taken at the Al Smith Benefit 
Dinner for Catholic hospitals and 
medical centers, where large 
names in politics are encouraged 
to make fun of themselves. 
Laura Calise, a junior English 
major and a member of Right On, 
helped coordinate the viewing of 
Fahrenhype 9/11. Though Calise 
said the content of Fahrenheit 
9/11 misleads the audience, she 
saw admirable qualities in the 
production of the film. I think 
its a brilliant work... it served its 
intellectually dishonest purpose 
very well. In response to Moores 
lecture, Calise said, I dont think 
theres a single one of us [conser
vatives on campus] who agrees 
with Michael Moores ideas. But, 
regardless, I think all people see 
an exorbitant, unfair amount of 
money being spent to bring a per
son with the sole intent to sway 
an election.
The choice of political speak
ers on campus has been debated 
often during the campaign sea
son, most recently at a forum 
last Wednesday addressing 
whether or not the Activities 
Board should be allowed to invite
such speakers. Jonathan Hersh, a 
sophomore information systems 
major and member of College 
Democrats, stated, I think that 
AB should bring speakers - espe
cially in an election year. It helps 
students feel closer to the politi
cal scene, and its a great confi
dence booster in terms of making 
them think that they can make 
a difference, which they can. As 
for liberal [speakers], I think that 
weve been having liberal speak
ers simply because were a lib
eral campus. It would be great for 
Bush to speak here, and Im sure 
AB would invite him.... Hersh 
also said that though Bush has 
supporters on campus, he might 
hesitate to come to campus due 
to the possibility of a poor recep
tion.
At this time, Calise is working

president who swore that 
Iraq had weapons of mass 
destruction. That Saddam was 
linked to 9/11. And that Iraqis 
would welcome us with open 
arms. He was dead wrong 
every time.
With George Bush stubbornly 
determined to go it alone, 
our allies won't join us. 
American troops will still be 
90 percent of the "coalition." 
And 90 percent of its dead 
and wounded.
And the volunteer military will 
be a casualty of war.
So unless you like the idea 
of graduate school in Fallujah, 
we need to pay careful 
attention to what our 
president is saying, versus 
what it really means.
Now do you feel that draft? .
Army recruiters can't fill their 
quotas. Re-enlistments are

With America's

already stretched 
to the breaking 
point in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, 
where are 
tomorrow's

As college students 
today, we ought to 
seriously consider that question.
Oh yes, President Bush insists 
he won't bring back the draft.

Former candidate Sharpton speaks at PittMichael Moore holds exclusive interview
by Louisa Kinoshi
Junior Staffwriter
The Reverend Al Sharpton 
spoke to a group of Kerry sup
porters on October 22 in the 
David Lawrence Auditorium at 
the University of Pittsburgh. He 
attacked President Bushs record 
on the war, education, taxes, and 
judicial appointments.
Sharpton encouraged young 
people to vote on November 2: It 
will be the young voters who will 
decide who wins and loses this 
election.... You are the swingers 
that they dont know exist.
He talked about the impor
tance of the younger demograph
ic as the most underrepresented 
group in the polls, because only 
previous voters are included in 
the polls and three million new 
young voters registered this elec
tion year.
Whoever wins will affect the 
rest of this century, for they will 
be appointing one, if not two 
justices to the Supreme Court....
Think about how Bush can ap
point a 40- to 50-year-old right
winger tQ the court, for it will be 
your children and grandchildren 
who will pay the price, said 
Sharpton.
Sharpton, who rose to promi
nence as an activist during the 
civil rights movement, voiced 
his fears that a conservative Su
preme Court could head back 
to a pre-1950s America. It was 
not the men in the white sheets, 
it was the men in the black 
robes.... The greatest danger for 
the women, blacks, Latinos, gays 
in this country is the Supreme 
Court, but we only get a vote for 
the President who appoints.
Sharpton also criticized the 
Democratic Party for leaning to 
the right. He stated that he went 
to the Democratic National Con
vention to stop it. We cant act 
like elephants in donkey jack
ets, he said.
Sharpton ran in the Democrat
ic primaries earlier this year. He 
made a pledge in the primaries 
to secure the right to vote. He
said Bush did not steal the votes 
in Florida only from Al Gore, 
but from the American people. 
The best way to avoid a repeat 
of Florida is to get as many vot
ers as you can to the polls as pos
sible and win a clear victory for 
Kerry.
Al Sharpton accused the Bush 
administration of trying to de
flect attention from Bushs Presi
dential record by talking about 
Kerrys record. You cant com
pare a non-Presidential record 
with that of an incumbent.
Sharpton also criticized 
Bushs constant references to 
religion and morality on the 
campaign trail. Im a preacher, 
and if George Bush wants to be a 
preacher, I suggest we elect John 
Kerry as President and we give 
George Bush a church in Craw
ford, Texas.
Grace Boateng, a first-year 
art major, enjoyed Al Sharptons 
speech.
I though he was effective. I 
could tell he really supported 
Kerry and his beliefs, she said.
INTERVIEW, from Al
next Tuesday, but the Republicans 
could very well have a 60-seat fili
buster-proof Senate and it may be 
very difficult for John Kerry to 
get anything done. So thats why 
its critical to pay attention to 
'these other races and to vote the 
Republicans out of the Senate and 
out of the House so that President 
Kerry can get something done. 
You know, when people say were 
a divided country, they say it like 
its a bad thing. This is whats 
good about a democracy, you have 
people with various viewpoints, 
people feel passionately about 
them, and they work towards the 
things they believe in. Thats a 
good thing in a free society.
The Tartan: How do we con
tinue that work beyond the elec
tion? You say we cant elect 
Republicans... what if we do? 
The Right is very good at orga
nizing at the grassroots and the 
churches and the school boards.

Do the math. Do the math; he has 
run out of troops. Recruitment 
is down; reenlistment is down. 
Forty percent of the troops that 
are there now are in the National 
Guard or Reserve. They are there 
for 18 months, they have to go 
back for another 18 months. They 
have run out of troops, and the 
only way hes going to be able 
to continue this war is to bring 
back the draft and thats exactly 
what hes going to do. As sure as 
I said on that Oscar stage, that 
first week of the war, that we are 
being lied to about weapons of 
mass destruction, I am telling you 
we are being lied to about the 
draft and there will be a draft. I 
think young people need to vote
in this election.
The Tartan: Do you have any 
advice to young students who 
want to continue this work?
Moore: What work would that 
be?
The Tartan: The fight that you 
keep describing.
Moore: I think that you have a 
very important job and thats the 
job of being a citizen. Democracy 
is not a spectator sport. Its a par
ticipatory event. Everybody has 
to come off the bench in order 
for it to work and that especially 
includes young people.
Fischer, Computer Science Professor and CEO 
of iCarnegie, and Mark Wessel, dean of the

The South Australia Premier also traveled to 
Pittsburgh to sign the agreement. The Premier 
stated that special legislation to establish 
the university will be introduced into State 
Parliament next year. Having signed this agree
ment, Carnegie Mellon and the government 
of South Australia will conduct a feasibility 
study.
According to Kamlet, In terms of benefiting 
Carnegie Mellon, there doubtless could be ben

dents are very engaged in the political process and 
specifically in this election.
One way that the organizers tried to increase 
turnout was to offer a $200 prize for the residence 
hall that had the highest percentage of voters. 
Forbes House won with 63 percent, with Morewood 
E Tower and Donner taking second and third with 
54 percent and 50 percent, respectively.
According to the tallied vote, John Kerry was 
the mock winner of the Presidency. With 2597 
students voting, Kerry won 70.2 percent of the 
popular vote, as well as every single electoral vote. 
Following Kerry (Democratic) were President Bush 
(Republican), with 22.68 percent of the vote, Ralph 
Nader (Independent) with 2.89 percent of the vote, 
Michael Badnarik (Libertarian) with 2.81 percent, 
Michael Peroutka (Constitution) with 0.92 percent, 
and David Cobb (Green) with 0.5 percent.
While Kerry won every single residence hall, 
there was a concerted effort to get out the vote from 
the College Republicans, who circulated an e-mail 
imploring members to vote.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 1, 2004
Moore spurs 
on student 
involvement
MOORE, from A1
[you]ve treated minorities the 
last three years. Moore said that 
he appreciated the Republicans 
presence at his speech, as democ
racy is not a spectator sport. He 
said that people of all beliefs and 
backgrounds should participate 
in government affairs.
Moores next target was Bill 
OReilly, host of The OReilly 
Factor on the Fox News 
Channel. Moore read passages 
from OReillys book OReilly 
Factor for Kids and joked about 
a chapter in the book in which 
OReilly discussed how not to be 
a bully. Moore waved the copy of 
OReillys book as he described 
OReilly as an angry white man 
... [who] sounds like a dying 
dinosaur.
Moore then showed a dozen 
30-second commercials parody
ing the Republican Party and 
President Bush. Moore explained 
that he intended to send the com
mercials to the Republican Party 
for them to run prior to Tuesdays 
election.
Although many students 
laughed at the satirical clips, not 
everyone was amused by Moores 
speech. First-year music major 
Elizabeth Hounshell felt that 
Moore had valid points but I 
hate his tactics. He was repetitive 
and obnoxious. Hounshell con
tinued, He says what everyone 
already knows.
Moore than turned his atten
tion to the health care industry. 
He read a secret memo distrib
uted at the Pfizer Company in 
which employees were warned 
that if they saw a bearded, heavyset man, wearing rumpled cloth
ing and holding a microphone, 
they should dial a hotline. Moore, 
the man referred to in the memo, 
then gave the hotline number to 
the audience and encouraged 
them to call.
Before introducing musical 
guest Anti-Flag, Moore conclud
ed by telling the audience that he 
wanted Pennsylvania to be blue 
on Tbesday.

representatives] leave. The 
bartenders were warned 
by members posted at the 
doors when IFC representa
tives were to arrive.
Anthony Morton, 
Carnegie Mellon Chapter 
President of DTD, stated 
late Sunday night that 
their chapter is work
ing out details regarding 
its future with Delta Tau 
Delta and Carnegie Mellon 
University.
Director of Student Life 
Rene Camerlengo said
that for now, the Alumni 
Corporation will work with 
Housing Services to allow 
individual members to 
stay in the chapter house 
through December 22. She 
also stressed that all of the 
incidents which led up to 
the chapters dismissal were 
allegations of chapter mis
conduct, not individual 
action.
The University is com
mitted to working with the 
local alumni and the nation
al office to bring Delta Tau 
Delta back to Carnegie 
Mellon at an appropriate 
time in the future, said 
Camerlengo. DTDs nation
al press release stated that 
a return is not anticipated 
until the fall 2007 semester 
at the earliest.
Greeks react to many 
serious challenges
In unrelated news, there 
has been discussion of on
going University Disciplin
ary Committee processes 
that affect other members 
of the Greek community. 
Due to the confidential 
nature of these processes, 
The Tartan will not be re
porting on their outcome 
until the process is final
ized. Greek Council, Interfraternity Council, Delta 
Upsilon, and BetaThetaPi 
would like to issue the fol
lowing statement:
The Interfraternity 
Council and Greek Coun
cil Presidents have gath
ered a committee of GreekS'members who are actively
analyzing the current po
sition of the Greek com
munity, researching the 
policies of comparative 
Greek communities at 
other universities, and re
writing our own policies 
to improve safety on the 
fraternity quad. The over
arching goals of the Greek
committee are consistent 
with the values of the 
greater campus commu
nity: to increase the safety 
of students and individual 
chapters while continuing 
social growth. The com
mittee realizes the need 
for immediate changes 
and wiE be proposing im
proved requirements for 
guest lists and ID checks 
within the coming week. 
We would like the support 
and patience of the cam
pus community as we be
gin implementing various 
shifts in policy.
The brothers of Delta 
Upsilon and Beta Theta 
Pi have a long-standing 
tradition of social growth 
and community outreach 
within Carnegie Mellon. 
We would like to main
tain the same presence 
on campus in the future. 
We feel it is inappropriate 
to comment on matters 
which have yet to be final
ized.

about her. This is a woman who tells 
whats on her mind and tells the 
truth to the American people.
Kerrys speech outlined his politi
cal strategy and addressed the prob
lems of the current administration, 
including the rising costs and gen
eral unavailability of health care. 
Kerry said that under President 
Bush, there has been a 64 per
cent increase in health care costs, 
a 12 percent increase in prescrip
tion drug costs, and a 17 percent 
increase in Medicare expenses for 
senior citizens.
We are going to stop being the 
only industrial country on the face 
of the planet that doesnt under
stand that health care isnt a privi
lege for the wealthy, or the con
nected, or the elected. It is a right 
for all Americans, he said.
To fund complete health care 
coverage for Americans, Kerry pro
posed to restore pay-as-you-go for 
Washington, D.C., in order to rein
state the fiscal discipline of the 
Clinton administration.
Addressing the war on terror, 
Kerry reiterated his charge that 
Bush was too hasty in going to war, 
and that the President had not used 
the military option as a last resort. 
The Senator called for a smart
er, more effective, tougher effort 
against terror, and said, I pledge to 
you I will restore Americas reputa
tion and respect, and we will fight

we will make America safer for all 
Americans in the future.
He [Bush] doesnt have a record 
to run on. He has a record to run 
away from, and thats exactly what 
hes doing, Kerry said.
In the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, 
Kevin Madden, a spokesman for the 
Bush campaign, dismissed Kerrys 
criticisms of the President.
You cant promote policies and 
offer rhetoric that divides America 
and then claim you are fit to lead it, 
Madden said. Defining yourself by 
what you are against, rather than by 
what you are for, is a very troubling 
platform for America.
Calling for the establishment of 
political alliances in foreign affairs, 
Kerry asserted, The United States 
of America is stronger, you pay less 
money, our troops are safer, and we 
have a greater chance of success 
when we take the time to do some
thing with other countries at our 
side, when we build the alliances 
necessary to lead the world. 
Evoking Americas pioneering his
tory in technology, Kerry pledged to 
create tax credits to promote manu
facturing jobs in order to excite 
small business innovation and 
research.... We are going to do the 
great research in the future that you 
do right here, he said. When Im 
President, I will re-commit America 
to science, research, development, 
and exploration.
A cleaner environment is also a 
pressing issue, according to Kerry, 
who said that roughly 44 percent of
American bodies of water contain 
water that is unfit for swimming 
and fishing. Kerry pledged a new 
goal for America: By the year 2020, 
20 percent of Americas electricity is 
going to be provided by alternative, 
renewable sources.
We have to acknowledge that 
there is no way possible for this 
nation to drill our way out of [the 
energy] predicament. We have to 
invent our way out, he said.
Actor and Carnegie Mellon alum
nus Ted Danson, one of the featured 
speakers of the evening, remarked 
that his good Republican father 
would be horrified by what 
[Bushs] administration has done to 
the environment.
Pittsburgh Steelers legend Franco 
Harris also attended the rally to say, 
God bless our Constitution. Our 
Constitution allows us to get rid of 
bad government after four years.
Rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, who 
travels with and supports the Kerry 
campaign, performed Living on 
a Prayer before Kerrys speech, a 
song that the Presidential hopeful 
later quipped referred to President 
Bushs economic plan.
All over the world, people are 
watching and waiting to see what 
youre going to decide, because 
youre not just electing the President 
of the United States; youre choos
ing the leader of the free world, 
Kerry said.
According to Khristyn Brimmeier, 
the Western Pennsylvanian 
Communications Director for the 
Kerry-Ed wards campaign, the 
local campaign committee and the 
University had less than a week to 
plan the event. Brimmeier cited 
two reasons why the committee 
selected Carnegie Mellon as the 
rally site: The school had a space 
large enough to accommodate the 
volume of people, and the univer
sity atmosphere was important in 
appealing to young voters.
The limited planning time was 
evident in meager organization: a 
line of people stretched from the 
Fence all the way down to Craig 
Street for most of the afternoon, 
and there was little crowd control 
beyond the use of metal detectors 
at the gate.
This was much more organized 
at Pitt, one woman in the crowd 
said, referring to Kerrys campaign 
stop there in the spring.

Rice speaks on international security
RICE, from A1
active in the world as a global 
institution and must understand 
and impact international issues, 
said Cohon. He then described 
Carnegie Mellons Qatar campus 
as a world class university in 
the Persian Gulf region ... with 
the values of an American insti
tution-freed om of expression 
and equality of opportunity. He 
described the students as bright, 
enthusiastic, quick to complain 
about the workload, and deter
mined to make a difference.... Dr. 
Rices presence here reminds us 
of our changing role as an inter
national university.
Rice then took the floor to 
encourage the audience to get 
involved in international rela
tions. I hope you will be inter
ested life advocates of interna
tional relations; the world is so 
much on us, we influence it and 
we have to be involved in it. She 
exhorted students to explore dif
ferent areas by taking different 
classes. College is the last time 
to get broader rather than nar
rower, she said.
During the question and 
answer session afterwards, one 
of the issues addressed was on 
breaking into the selective for
eign policy planning committees. 
Rice encouraged students to par
ticipate in local foreign estab
lishment councils such as the
Pittsburgh World Affairs Council, 
attend local conferences, and take 
advantage of programs such like 
the International Affairs Fellows 
program. She stressed the impor
tance of engaging in the outside 
world on foreign policy.
Rice also addressed interactions 
of other disciplines with interna
tional relations. Problems dont 
come in neat disciplinary pack
ages, she warned.
Another issue addressed was 
the change in foreign policy 
during the post-Cold War peri
od. Rice said one of the chal
lenges posed after the Cold War 
the necessity to understand the 
nature of international threats 
we face. She said September 11 
helped clarify the main threat as 
a radical, extremist ideology of 
hatred, far more widespread with 
state sponsors, training camps, 
and funding- supplanting moder
ate Islam with radical Islam. She 
also mentioned American rela
tions with Palestine and Saudi 
Arabia.
We [can] focus change in the 
broader Middle East as an anti
dote to the ideology of hatred 
that grew up there, she said.
Rice also talked about the war 
in Iraq and Saddam Hussein. 
We thought he had stockpiles
 of weapons of mass destruction, 
stockpiles. Instead what he had 
were a set of capabilities, a set 
of expertise, a lot of money, and
plans to get away from UN sanc
tions. She added, You can never 
break the link between Husseins 
administration and weapons of 
mass destruction; weapons of 
mass destruction were just as 
important to his administration 
as breathing.
Rice said the U.S. had to 
replace Saddams regime with an 
ally in the war on terrorism. She 
described Saddam Hussein as 
the greatest source of instability 
in the most dangerous region in 
the world.
The program ended with a pre
sentation by the Universitys ath
letic department. Rice was given 
a personalized Carnegie Mellon 
University jersey.
She was very impressive. She 
did a good job. She answered our 
questions and the students gave 
good questions. It is an honor 
to have her here, said Rachelle

about recycling and to see if the 
shortcomings of recycling are a 
result of students or the mainte
nance collecting it. We found a 
little of both, Davis said.
The students are putting recy
clables in the recycling bins, and 
then the [maintenance] workers 
are shoving the recycling bags 
in with the trash. Wed find 
[recycling] bags inside of [trash] 
bags, said Camille Fisher, a firstyear H&SS student and member 
of Sustainable Students.
The participants also found 
numerous bags of recycled office
paper in the trash. People prob
ably thought they were recycling 
by gathering all their extra paper, 
and then workers were just toss
ing them in with the bigger trash 
bags, remarked Fisher. We 
realized something needed to be 
said about that.
According to Davis, recycling 
is an important issue for students 
and maintenance to pay atten
tion to. We will run out of room 
in the landfills. Particularly on 
this campus we could save money 
by recycling because we will send 
out less trash.

Piracy creates 
holes in video 
game industry
by Bhas Nalabothula
Junior Staffwriter
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, 
Halo 2, and Doom 3: This is just 
a short list of some of the most 
anticipated titles in gaming that 
have hit the Internet before their 
scheduled releases this year. Game 
piracy is nothing new; it has been 
around as long as games have. For 
many college students, download
ing games is standard practice. 
A student who wishes to remain 
anonymous and who has pirated 
many games during the past few 
years said, I understand that its 
wrong, but the fact is its basically 
impossible to get caught.
A second student who wishes 
to remain anonymous said about 
his impetus for illegally copying 
games: I pirate because its free, 
easy, and fast.
As the gaming industry gets big
ger, a greater number of games 
seem to be hitting peer-to-peer 
(P2P) networks days  some
times months  before official re
lease. The rapid increase in game 
piracy can partially be attributed 
to applications like the popular 
BitTorrent, one of the first pro
grams that brought easy software 
piracy to the masses. Although 
many P2P applications preceded 
it, none were as notoriously ef
fective in reaching out beyond the 
dedicated pirates.

One of the great boons our 
country has enjoyed in modern 
times has been the speedy deliv
ery of mail. This has been made 
possible by the steady advance 
of transportation technology, 
processing techniques, and the
United States Postal Services 
pledge to provide prompt, re
liable, and efficient services to 
patrons in all areas. 
Origin-to-destination deliv
ery times for transcontinental 
mail traveling via the railroad 
and Pony Express took 13 to 14 
days in 1860. Today, coast-coast 
deliveries are as short as 6 hours 
when sent by air. This may seem
Lizza McGregor/Art Editor
long compared to the instant 
correspondence of e-mail, but 
until Scotty is sending packages 
through the transporter buffer, 
there will be a need for physical 
transport of mail. Recognizing 
this need, the U.S. Postal Ser
vice has pioneered advance
ments in mail processing.
To best understand how mail 
is processed, we can follow a
letters route from start to fin
ish. Consider Tom Swift, who 
wishes to write to his family 
across the country. Tom takes 
his correctly addressed enve
lope and drops it in his curbside mailbox, in one of over 
300,000 street collection box
es, at one of over 37,000 Post 
Offices, or into the bag of his 
local letter carrier. These car
riers bring Toms letter to the 
local Post Office.
Once at the Post Office, the 
letter enters what is called 
receiving. Letters can go two 
ways: local or out-of-town de
livery. This preliminary sorting 
is done either by the carriers 
or by Mr. Swift himself, who 
can drop his letter in the Outof-Town slot. Mail divided here 
goes through separate process
ing lines, but the steps for each 
automated line are the same.
The first step, known as cull
ing, removes mail with dimen
sions unsuitable for follow-on 
machines. Examples of mail 
culled from letter-sorting ma
chines include packages, large 
envelopes, and magazines. 
Magazines and large enve
lopes, which make up a class of 
mail known as flats, have their 
own dedicated machines. Pack
ages dont usually undergo au
tomated sorting at local branch 
offices. Culling is accomplished 
by drums and rollers that seg
regate by thickness, width, and 
stiffness and use light sensors to 
determine length.

Allerca to create 
hypoallergenic cat
The Los Angeles-based company 
Allerca is developing the worlds 
first hypoallergenic cats. Most 
people who are allergic to cats 
are bothered by a glycoprotein 
present in cats fur, saliva, serum, 
urine, mucus, salivary glands, and 
hair roots. Using a genetic engi
neering technique called gene 
silencing, the company will focus 
on the gene that is responsible 
for creating the allergen in order 
to prevent it from being secreted. 
Allerca is taking reservations for 
hypoallergenic cats, which will 
cost $3500, and expects the first of 
the hypoallergenic cats to be avail
able in 2007.

Skeleton discovery 
rewrites history
Scientists have discovered the 
partial remains of a previously un
known species of early human in a 
remote Indonesian island, Flores. 
The species may have been adive as 
recently as 12,000 years ago. The 
best-preserved specimen, acthreefoot-tall adult female, would have 
had a brain about one-quarter the 
size of Homo sapiens. The skel
etons were found among stone 
tools and animal remains; some 
of which were charred, suggesting 
that they were cooked. The scien
tists have dubbed the new species 
Homo floresiensis. Myths of a hobbit-like race called ebu gogo are 
rife in Indonesia. In light of their 
discovery, some scientists specu
late on the possibility that the 
species may still be living in the 
remote, inaccessible forests and 
cave networks of southeast Asia.

WiMax to offer T1 
over long distances
The techology powerhouse In
tel has thrown its weight behind 
the drive to establish a new tech
nological norm called WiMax
 Worldwide Interoperability for 
Microwave Access  or 802.16. 
WiMax-enabled devices will be 
able to communicate with trans
mitters from as far as 30 miles 
and at rates of up to 70 megabits 
per second. Intel suggests that a 
single transmitter will be capable 
of serving as many as 60 busi
nesses or hundreds of home users 
at speeds comparable to that of a 
T1 line or DSL. Plans also exist for 
the technology to be used to cre
ate hot-spots covering entire cit
ies. One company, TowerStream, 
has already acquired rights to 
place transmitters on the rooftops 
of skyscrapers in Boston, Chicago, 
and New York City, preparing to 
deploy WiMax infrastructure as 
soon as the technology hits the 
consumer market.

Researchers challenge an accepted theory of decision-making
* by Mark Egerman
*' Executive Officer
Z A new paper published by 
Z researchers in CMLPs psychology department challenges a 
widely-believed theory: the 
somatic marker hypothesis. 
This hypothesis states that 
decision-making is influenced 
by somatic markers: bodily 
states that correspond to 
emotional reactions. Accord
ing to the hypothesis, these 
somatic markers can act sub
consciously to guide decisions 
in the absence of conscious 
knowledge. This theory, pos
ited by neurologist Antonio 
Damasio in the mid-nineties 
in his international best sell
er, Descartes Error: Emotion, 
Reason, and the Human Brain, 
has become very popular.
Researchers in the psychol
ogy department have chal
lenged this theory by examin
ing the evidence that supports 
it. Tiago V. Maia, a doctoral 
'I student, and James L. Mc
Clelland, the Walter Van Dyke 
Bingham Professor of Psy
chology and Cognitive Neu
roscience, analyzed a study 
performed by Damasio and 
his colleagues. In this study, 
Damasio and colleagues 
sought to demonstrate the 
existence of somatic markers

were playing the game, the

the subjects open-ended 
questions such as Tell me all

on in this game. Combining 
an analysis of participants 
behavior, their responses, 
and their skin conductances, 
Damasio found that partici
pants would often choose an

the way conscious knowledge 
was assessed was suspect: 
There is good evidence in 
the literature that the use 
of such broad questions of
ten fails to uncover all of the 
knowledge that subjects ac
tually have. When answering 
this type of question, subjects 
may not tell you everything 
they know because, for exam
ple, they arent sure of their

dent Bushs tax policy has al
lowed a tax cut at the expense of 
the scientific community, which 
has seen drops in federal funding. 
As a result, there is less incentive 
for intelligent young people, both 
American and foreign, to seek ca

Varmus went on to criticize 
the Bush administrations forma

scientific method, observing that 
the steps to declaring war on Iraq 
were taken despite a lack of evi
dence. As scientists, we appreci
ate the evaluation of evidence, 
Varmus said.
Varmus also sternly criticized 
the current administration for its 
effect on the strength of Ameri

delivered speeches regarding 
the relationship between gov

munity, especially as it relates to 
public policy.
The government is increas
ingly responsible for providing 
for research, said Varmus, ex
plaining that since World War II, 
government funding and support 
has been vital to scientific and 
technological progress. The pur
suit of science, he said, has usu

He pointed out, though, that in 
this election it has become more 
of a dividing issue.
According to Varmus, Presi-Maxine Singer (left) and Harold Varmus discuss issues after their presentation in McConomy Auditorium last 
TUesday. They spoke openly about science in the 2004 Presidential election and its state in the last four years.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 1, 2004
Game piracy a plague due to file-sharing and ineffective hacker protection
PIRACY, from A8
If it was even easier I probably 
wouldnt pirate much because I realize 
that games take a lot of work to make 
and I can get many hours of enjoyment 
out of them, said Chris Kier, a first-year 
in H&SS, about his piracy ethic.
The groups who release the leaked or 
stolen copies of games onto the Internet 
are in constant competition with each 
other to present the next game. These 
individuals risk their jobs and futures 
by offering the software on the Internet, 
but many do it for the respect and thrill it 
brings them. Recently, a French version 
of Halo 2 was leaked; a campus group 
even painted the message We Have Halo 
2 on the Fence. The games Internet re
lease had a huge effect because of the an
ticipation surrounding it, and the relative 
prevalence of modified XBox consoles 
that do not have anti-piracy measures.
PC games are different from console 
games in that they almost always require 
the release group to code an executable 
that can bypass the games copy protec
tion. Such protections also tend to ham
per the ability of the cracked game to 
connect to online multiplayer environ
ments. Working past a games protection 
has become a slower process in recent 
months, with the advent of invasive yet 
effective copy protections such as StarForce 3; games protected with this new 
anti-piracy measure have occasionally 
taken months to be properly cracked. 
However, StarForce 3 is still not in wide 
use, because it brings copy protection to 
the driver level and uninstalling games
protected by it often leaves remnants of 
the protection on gamers computers.
While it is obvious that the piracy of 
games results in a hit to the involved com
panies profits, the leak of a games source 
code is much more devastating. Half-Life 
2, the sequel to what is considered by 
many to be the greatest PC game of all 
time, had its source code leaked after 
malicious crackers decided to code their 
own tools from scratch and use an exploit 
in Microsoft Outlook to gain access to the 
servers of Halo creators Valve.
After the code was stolen, it was dis
tributed quickly. While the source code 
itself didnt help most gamers, many 
feared that it would allow crackers to 
take advantage of holes in the code and 
develop cheats to play with online. A 
few days after the code was released, the 
same people who stole the code released 
a playable, partially-completed version 
of Half-Life 2. This Half-Life 2 offering 
was one of many factors that pushed the 
originally planned release from Septem
ber 30, 2003, to November 16, 2004. 
Fortunately, source code thefts are ex
tremely uncommon in the gaming world 
because the source code is only seen by 
those in the gaming industry. Many game 
companies make large profits by licensing 
their source to other companies games.
With Internet connections as fast as 
they are, piracy of games will continue 
to see an increase. Threats of large fines 
targeted at pirates havent slowed down 
piracy, either. It seems that the problem 
will grow unless anti-piracy measures be
come stronger or until it can be stopped 
at its root: the release groups.
Courtesy of octanus.forerunners.org
Halo 2, a highly anticipated XBox game to be released November 9, has been available on the Internet before this week. Source code and 
early game leaks have become more frequent in the last few years, and are can be attributed to manufacturing company workers illegally 
passing out final disk presses.
Singer and Varmus discuss science in the election
ELECTIONS, from A8
the Bush administration of using 
facts that are purposely distorted 
to support Bushs agenda.
For example, the FDA recently 
disapproved the sale of the con
troversial Plan B emergency 
contraceptive pill over the coun
ter, despite its being endorsed 
by an advisory committee of 
scientists. Such practices do not 
honor the traditional value of 
the peer review policies which 
have been such a valuable influ
ence to American science, said 
Varmus. He continued this point 
by condemning Bushs use of reli
gion, not science, as his principal 
foundation for policy-making.
Maxine Singer, who spoke sec
ond, elaborated by citing Bushs 
stalwart endorsement of ab
stinence education as opposed 
to instruction in contraceptive 
practices. She observed that the 
administration is openly against 
the use of condoms. If theres a 
second Bush term, were going to
see more action against contra
ceptive devices and contraceptive 
means, she said. She expressed 
concern that the governments 
aversion to contraceptive policy 
could have grave consequences 
in the fight against the spread of 
AIDS, especially in Africa.
These issues are of serious con
cern for all Americans, accord
ing to Carnegie Mellon professor 
Jon Peha: If the Administration 
ignores what scientists and en
gineers at places like CMU know 
about health care, energy, the en
vironment, or homeland security, 
everyone is affected  not just 
those involved with science.
Singer expressed concern for 
the future of scientific innovation. 
President Bush, she said, has left 
much of the burden of research 
and innovation on private en
terprises, when it is traditionally 
the governments job to support 
research. Singer endorsed Demo
cratic candidate John Kerry, cit
ing his balanced approach to ba
sic and applied research, funded
by the federal government.
Singers speech also focused 
on the environment, lauding 
Kerrys grade of 96 percent by the 
League of Conservation Voters, 
a non-partisan group that rates 
politicians environmental policy. 
Singer noted that President Bush

received a failing grade.
She also condemned Bushs at
tempts to build a bunker-busting 
atomic bomb. The United States 
has not sought to create new 
nuclear weapons for decades, she 
said, and given the United States 
new foreign policy of striking pre
emptively, this new atomic cam
paign encourages, rather than 
deters, hostile nations creating
their own nuclear weapons. I 
have never been so concerned 
about the direction of our coun
try, said Singer.
When asked whether he fears 
reprisals for his vehement con
demnation of the Bush adminis
tration, Varmus responded, We 
live in what we used to consider 
an enlightened democracy. He 
claimed the administration uses 
scare tactics and sensationalism 
to suppress opposition and legiti
mate inquiry. The nation cannot 
thrive with an administration 
that does not have a strong com
mitment, a true commitment, to 
science and technology, he said.

they had a more thorough test 
of what people knew when they 
were playing the game.
By using this more sensitive 
test of conscious knowledge, 
Maia and McClelland showed 
that individuals may have been 
acting upon knowledge and not 
bodily states. The researchers 
look at other evidence that sup
ported the somatic marker the
ory and found that in all cases 
recent results suggest alternative 
interpretations for evidence that 
do not involve somatic markers.
Having undermined the foun
dation for the somatic marker 
hypothesis, the researchers have

Next, Toms letter is brought by 
air suction or high-speed rollers 
to the facing/canceling machine. 
This machine uses a variety of 
detectors to determine on which 
side the postage stamp is and void 
it with a mark identifying the date 
and Post Office. Facers/cancelers 
detect postage with fluorescent 
ink detectors, chromatic and con
trast sensors, and serrated edge 
recognition. They are also pro
grammed to recognize pre-paid 
or franked postage, which isnt 
cancelled.
From here, letters proceed to 
the optical character recognition/ 
video coding system machine 
(OCR/VCS). Each piece of mail 
speeds by an electronic eye which 
uses heuristic algorithms to rec
ognize characters, both hand
written and typed. The digitally 
rendered address is standardized 
with correct abbreviations and 
then compared against a national 
database. This national database 
assigns an 11-digit ZIP code to 
each piece of mail.
An 11-digit ZIP code, you ask? 
While most people are accus
tomed to seeing 5-digit ZIP codes, 
all ZIP codes are actually ZIP+4 
codes, or 9 digits long. The first 
digit represents a large region of 
the country  zero, for example, 
represents the Northeast  and 
each successive digit represents 
a smaller and smaller area, some 
representing individual floors of 
buildings. An extra two digits are 
tacked on after the ZIP+4 code 
for further specification.
Once this 11-digit number is 
known, the video coding system 
prints a 62-line barcode on the 
letter that shows where the mail 
is to be sent. To avoid interference 
from the existing address, the 
barcode is usually printed on UV 
or invisible ink, which are easily 
distinguished by machines.
On about 15 percent of addresses, the electronic eye can
not determine the 11-digit ZIP. 
These letters are redirected to 
a standby loop before the barcoder is reached. Technicians at 
computers examine unread ad
dresses and manually enter the 
information so each letter can 
pass through the bar-coder. With 
650 million pieces of mail being 
handled a day, almost 100 mil
lion letters have to be manually 
entered. One can see the need for 
automation in mail-handling.
Finally, letters pass through a 
sorting machine. This machine 
reads the newly-printed barcodes 
on each envelope and sorts each 
letter into one of many different 
bins for processing. If Toms letter 
were locally bound, it would be 
sorted into a bin that represented
some local mail route. However, 
since Toms family is across the 
country his letter will be sorted 
into a bin destined for a large re
gional processing center. At these 
centers robotic arms group large 
amounts of mail into gigantic 
transportation containers await
ing travel by tractor-trailer, air
plane, or even rail.
On arriving at its destination, 
Toms letter will be unpacked and 
sent through even more sorting 
machines, sorting mail into small
er and smaller groups. Soon, the 
friendly neighborhood mailman is 
dropping a letter in the Swift fam
ily mailbox. While the U.S. Postal 
Service boasts that it delivers mail 
through rain, shine, and snow, 
perhaps it should add through

Forum
THE TARTANI November 2004
Short vacations strain students 
health and wellness for naught
ties, is average. But for some reason the 
administration chose to tack our mid
semester break onto the Friday before 
spring break. For the students, this is a 
problem.
To exacerbate the situation, students 
enrolled in mini classes do not get to enjoy 
mid-semester break, as it is the mini final 
exam period. In the fall semester, having 
no break from August to Thanksgiving 
aside from Labor Day at the very begin
ning of September is painful given the 
added stress and personal issues.
On top of all this, winter break has 
been shortened. In the 2003-2004 school 
year, the University administration had 
allotted for students to have a threeand-a-half week break from December 
17 to January 11. This year, the break has 
been shortened to about two-and-a-half 
weeks, starting December 22 and ending 
January 10. Considering the amount of 
work that most Carnegie Mellon students 
put in, this is an unfairly short amount 
of time.
The administration might argue that 
other universities have similar practices, 
and that by pushing the start date of 
classes back  something that was done 
this year  that they are only doing what 
has been proven best for the student 
body. If we look at similar universities 
such as MIT, we see that although the 
start date of classes is further back, our 
schedule in no way resembles theirs.
MIT seems to have the right idea. 
By breaking the semester into smaller 
chunks with one or two day breaks once 
a month, they keep students from becomming overwhelmed by work and stress. 
Carnegie Mellon needs to figure out a 
way to break their semesters up and 
reconsider the value of extra classes over 
students mental health. Hopefully in the 
future we will see a change in University 
policy and the administration will realize 
that the student body will function better 
and more efficiently when well rested.
Everyone needs a break. We all have 
friends to visit and families waiting for 
us at home. And, more importantly, con
stant work increases studennts stress and 
decreases our productivity. Most univer
sities understand this and give their stu
dents ample time to relax. In recent years, 
though, CMU has taken the opposite 
path, shortening our breaks and decreas
ing our much needed time for rest and 
relaxation.
Over the past few years, CMU has 
decreased the amount of time we have in 
our breaks in order to maximize the length 
of the school year. Although increasing 
our learning time sounds great, we need 
to reconsider the effect it has on the stu
dent body.
For many students, the amount of time 
we spend in labs or studying well exceeds 
the amount of time spent sitting down, 
reading a book, or meeting people.
It seems that in recent years many uni
versities feel that they need to maximize 
the amount of work their students put in. 
Because of this, our breaks have shifted. 
Our mid-semester break, which used to 
be two days, has been shortened to one, 
and in the spring has been attached to the 
beginning of spring break.
Although mid-semester break doesnt 
sound like it would be a huge deal, to 
a busy student, every day off matters. 
Before the 2002-2003 school year, each 
break was two days long. This, followed 
by Thanksgiving break with winter break 
less than a month and a half away was 
enough time for students to rest.
But in the 2003-2004 academic year, 
spring mid-semester break was shortened 
to one day and attached to the beginning 
of spring break.
In the spring, students are only typi
cally allotted one break period, excluding 
Carnival, which is so close to finals week 
that it doesnt make much of a difference.

Pimps and Hos costumes no laughing matter
that women are items for male con
sumption. Parties like this reinforce 
themes of male domination and female 
objectification that have no place at 
Carnegie Mellon. And before you object 
that TSA, like any group of students, 
has the right to do whatever it wants, 
remember that TSA is a funded orga
nization and this party was paid for in 
part by your student activities fee.
TSA is not the only group to choose 
Pimps and Hos as a party theme. A 
few years back it was the theme of 
the annual SPIRIT Ball. Why organi
zations, especially' minority cultural 
organizations, choose to celebrate with 
the theme of womens oppression is a 
mystery. Perhaps the members of TSA 
are so sheltered that they have never 
encountered a prostitute; they may be 
under the incorrect assumption that 
women want to be prostitutes. This is 
almost never the case; over 90 percent 
of prostitutes surveyed desire to get out 
of prostitution. It is certainly not race 
that has made students blind to prosti
tution  its class.
The students who organized this party 
and the people who have organized par
ties like it in the past almost always 
come from a class position that fully 
separates them from the harsh realities 
of prostitution and of being pimped out. 
Perhaps they do not know of the fact 
that many prostitutes are children when 
they start, a large number of them are 
victims of incest, and that pimps exploit 
these women even further. The people 
who organized this party have obvi
ously never been in a position where 
their resources are so limited that pros
titution is their only option.
TSA is completely unaware of the 
realities of prostitution. In their own 
country of Taiwan the government 
conservatively estimates that there are 
over 30,000 minors in prostitution, 
the majority of them sold into prosti
tution by their parents. Other sources 
estimate the number of child prosti
tutes to be around 60,000. Pimps in 
Taiwan often give their child prostitutes 
hormone injections so that their bod
ies will develop faster, earning them 
more money. If a prostitute is the victim 
of theft or assault, she has very little 
recourse open to her. The U.S. State 
Departments website on Taiwan also 
declares prostitution, especially child 
prostitution, to be a problem there. No 
decent person would consider this crisis 
to be an appropriate party theme.
In reality, there is nothing glamorous 
or fun about being a prostitute. It is an 
outrage that this party took place and 
even more appalling that money from 
the student activities fee was spent on 
funding it. It is appalling that Carnegie 
Mellon students could be so ignorant 
about the plight of a victimized group 
of women that they would allow such a 
party to take place.
Alisha Bhagat
In a nation in which prostitution 
employs hundreds of thousands of 
women, many of them under the age 
of 16, it is appalling that the Taiwanese 
Student Association (TSA) would choose 
Pimps and Hos as a party theme for 
their annual Halloween bash.
Ho, a slang term for whore or pros
titute, is the role assigned to women at 
this party. Men are pimps, people who 
sell other men time with the prostitutes. 
Finding humor and enjoyment in the 
plight of prostitutes and the purchase 
of a womans body by a man is just as 
hilarious of a party theme of Nazis and 
Jews or white slave-owners and black 
slaves. Just as the campus community 
would be outraged at a party based 
around one of these themes, the cam
pus community should be outraged by 
a party themed around the exploitation 
of womens bodies by men.
TSAs party encourages female stu
dents to take on the role of a prosti
tute. Men are assigned the role of pimp. 
Almost as shocking as the party is that 
students would willingly take on these 
roles. Just as no student on campus 
would dress as a black slave, no student 
should want to dress as a ho.
The party sends out the message that 
its fun to be a prostitute, that women 
should want to sell sex for money, and
Election ads should focus on 
substantive issues and not hype
In the precious time left before the up
coming P residential election, partisan 
campaign advertisements are a dominant 
feature of all media outlets. These ads 
make no attempt to focus on the actual 
issues of the election, and instead seek 
to sway the viewers bias against the op
posing candidate. The creators of these 
commercials realize it is easier to be con
descending to the American public and 
sway them with slogans, scare tactics, 
and morality attacks than to present the 
candidates stance on current issues, vot
ing record, and plans for the future, all of 
which are what a voter should take into 
consideration before deciding on a candi
date.
One of the most recent examples of 
this partisan display comes with a Re
publican spin. Eerie and dramatic music 
plays in the background as wolves scav
enge around in the background, and a 
womans voice says: In an increasingly 
dangerous world, even after the first ter
rorist attack on America, John Kerry and 
the liberals in Congress voted to slash 
Americas intelligence operations by six 
billion dollars; cuts so deep they would 
have weakened Americas defenses, and 
weakness attracts those who are waiting 
to do America harm. The biggest issue 
with this advertisement is that it is inten
tionally vague; referring to the terrorist 
attack in 1993, not what the vast majority 
would believe was September 11.
On the Democratic side, there are bla
tant attempts to pander to certain demo
graphics. The abuse of patriotic symbols
during these advertisements is rampant, 
because it is easier than actually proving 
patriotism or making a case for Kerrys 
election. Our soldiers fighting in Iraq are 
heroes; their families have earned our 
thanks and our support. As we see the cri
sis and chaos in Iraq, as we choose a new 
commander in chief, we will always sup
port and honor those who serve: Strength, 
Courage, Patriotism. This broad general 
statement means nothing to the election. 
It holds no plan for the future of Iraq, nor 
does it make any progressive argument 
addressing his case. Eagles and flags can
not be used to elect a President any more 
than it can to sell a car. Candidates need 
to be elected because they are capable 
of leading and protecting a nation, and 
protecting the individual citizens of that 
nation. They cannot merely be displayed 
like a windup doll spouting general state
ments designed to gain support, but this 
is how they are being touted by their ad
vertisements.
This trend of condescension to the pub
lic to present a candidate aids no one. An 
election, especially one as important as 
this, should not be presented the same 
way as a Jerry Springer commercial. An 
election should be seen as a time to sup
port discussion and promote a thorough 
understanding of the political system. If 
this behavior is not encouraged by those 
running for office, then who take up the 
cause? People must seek to combat the 
growing media sensationalism of politics, 
or we will merely have this forced upon 
us for years to come.

I want to be out of the war in Iraq 
because its not fair for the troops 
to be there. More liberal womens 
rights.
State should charge on 1-80, not pike, via fixed-toll barriers
Adam Greenberg
When talks between 
Pennsylvania Turnpike manage
ment and unions representing 
toll collectors and maintenance 
workers broke down last week, 
there was the severe threat of 
a strike. This was in spite of a 
raise on the $15.76-an-hour start
ing wage and a healthcare plan 
offered to the representatives. In 
the event of such a strike, only 
700 managers would be filling 
the jobs of thousands and collect
ing flat tolls instead of the usual 
per-mile tolls. But why use a com
plex ticket system and why toll 
the Pike at all when there is a bet
ter option sitting nicely between 
Sharon and Stroudsburg?
I come from the suburbs of 
Philadelphia, and so a trip home 
usually means this: five hours on 
the Turnpike and $16 in tolls. 
For those readers unfamiliar with 
the road, it was built in the late 
1930s and opened to traffic in 
October 1940. Until recently, 
when the Pennsylvania Turnpike 
Commission (PTC) began a com
plete rebuild of the road, the high
way felt like one opened in 1940: 
filled seams in the roadway, pot
holes, inadequate sight distance, 
sub-par rest areas, frequent lane 
closures, and naturally, a fee for 
the privilege of using it.
Further north in the state 
lies Interstate 80. Planned by 
the Turnpike Commission in 
the late 1940s but built by the 
Pennsylvania Department of 
Highways after the Interstate 
Highway Act, the road is free, 
except for a toll bridge over the 
Delaware River. It too is weak 
on road conditions, historically 
being considered one of the worst
Interstate Act highways in the 
country, but its far better than 
the Turnpike as regards mainte
nance (by PennDOT, rather than 
the Turnpike) and safety features 
such as wide medians and sight 
distance.
Changing 1-80 to a toll road has 
been suggested before. Governors 
Milton Shapp and Tom Ridge 
both supported tolling the high
way, the latter having changed 
from opposition shortly before 
leaving for his current post in 
Homeland Security. The current 
state Secretary of Transportation, 
Allen Biehler, has also commis
sioned a study on tolling the road, 
with fixed-toll barriers every 30 
miles.
There are several reasons to
move tolls from the Turnpike 
to 1-80. The first is that the 
Pennsylvania Turnpike passes 
through the most heavily popu
lated areas of the state, running 
by Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and 
Pittsburgh, and is used primarily 
by Pennsylvanians. Conversely, 
1-80, the so-called Keystone 
Shortway between New York City 
and Cleveland, passes through 
the empty northern tier of 
Pennsylvania and is used primar
ily by out-of-state tourists, truck
ers, and traffic to the several col
leges that line the corridor.
The biggest political opposi
tion to it comes from the truck
ing industry, which would be 
deprived of a rare free route from 
the Northeast to Ohio. Another
problem lies in that the road was 
built by money from the Federal 
Highway Administration, and 
thus the FHAs permission must 
be secured in order to instate a 
toll.
The main technical problems 
with the toll are that it would 
induce a traffic shift from 1-80 
to the Turnpike and that the 
design of Interstate 80 limits toll
ing options. 1-80 has the design 
features of a free road, such as 
diamond interchanges where 
all ramps do not pass through a 
common point en route to the 
intersecting road. This makes toll 
collection somewhat more diffi
cult and practically eliminates the 
possibility of the ticket/toll sys
tem used on the Turnpike main

And so Pennsylvania has U.S. Senator 
Rick I have no problem with homosexual
ity  I have a problem with homosexual 
acts Santorum (R-Pa.), and University of 
Pittsburgh Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, 
who for years would occasionally descend 
from his ivory tower to pay lip service to 
his respect for diversity while supporting 
policies that ensured that homosexuals 
would remain second-class citizens.
While Pitt has recently decided to grant 
health benefits to homosexual couples, it 
is difficult to forget what happened along 
the way.
The campaign for change formally 
began with a 1996 discrimination lawsuit 
by the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the 
American Civil Liberties Union, which was 
initiated on behalf of a group of seven 
current and former university employees. 
They wanted nothing more radical than to 
have Pitt  an institution so deeply com
mitted to advancing the cause of human 
health, according to Nordenberg  pro
vide medical coverage to their domestic 
partners the same way it did for hetero
sexual couples.
The university responded in a way typi
cal of powerful institutions that seek ways 
to flout legality: It preempted the lawsuit. 
Pitt won a temporary order that prevented 
the Commission on Human Relations from 
even hearing the case. That temporary 
order became permanent earlier this year 
with a January 12 ruling.
The general basis for the permanent 
order was a 1999 law that Pitt had, not
surprisingly, lobbied the state to pass. So 
much for justice being blind.
That law held that state-related colleges 
and universities  e.g., Pitt  would not 
have to provide health benefits because of 
municipal laws. In other words, Pitt was 
able to lobby the state to pass a law which 
allowed it to not have to comply with 
existing municipal law, which barred dis
crimination based on sexual orientation. 
This is known as pursuing other avenues 
for more collegially and effectively dealing 
with the matter, in Nordenbergs wording. 
What, after all, in the universitys eternal

Recently, our neighbors at the University 
of Pittsburgh made the news when the 
administration of that school decided 
to offer benefits to same-sex partners of 
employees. This had been an issue for 
some time, especially among those who 
see themselves as furthering the cause of 
gay rights. Related to this is the decisive 
issue of gay marriage, or at least the con
sideration of civil unions for same-sex 
couples. While allowing same-sex partner 
benefits at Pitt is a somewhat separate 
question, it is not that difficult to construct

line. Fixed-toll barrier systems, 
like the one proposed by Biehler, 
mean free rides for some, but 
the system is used on most toll 
roads in the country, with the 
northeastern toll-road complex 
and the Florida Turnpike being 
the exceptions.
The Turnpike continues to use 
the ticket system for its mainline 
and Northeast Extension, but the 
Commission is not against barrierand-ramp tolls; in fact, all recent 
toll developments have been 
such. These include the western 
Pennsylvania expansions such as 
the Mon-Fayette Expressway, the 
western end of the mainline (now 
ticket-free with a single toll bar
rier), and the northern end of the 
Northeast Extension in Scranton. 
Additionally, the eastern end of 
the mainline is scheduled to con
vert to a fixed-toll barrier later in 
this decade when the interchange 
with 1-95 is completed.
The reason fixed-toll systems 
are becoming more popular with 
the execs in Harrisburg is sim
ple: Fixed tolls can be collected 
automatically using E-ZPass and 
exact-change machines. They 
eliminate the need for the prob
lematic personnel, which has 
never been more important a 
change than during last weeks 
negotiations.
Changing toll systems for per
sonnel reasons will necessitate 
a complete reworking of the toll 
system anyway. To move the 
burden to non-residents from 
Pennsylvanians, to corporations 
from individuals, charge on 1-80 
instead of the Turnpike.

a case in opposition to this general move
ment.
Before anyone can eloquently oppose 
the concept of gay marriage, one should 
look at what marriage has been for histori
cally, and what it should be for objectively. 
While marriage has been entwined with 
religion for much of its history as an insti
tution in the West, we still can isolate the 
purposes of such an institution. Why is 
marriage necessary? Marriage is needed 
to form a caring, supportive environment 
in which children can be born and raised, 
and form a familial arrangement so issues 
of legitimacy and inheritance can be made 
clear. Most who have read this piece up to 
this point would probably wonder why I 
have not used the terms love or com
panionship yet. These ideals are equally 
as important, and are implied. Why go 
through the bother of raising a child for 
eighteen years if you did not love your 
spouse? How would that be providing 
the caring, supportive environment I 
referred to earlier? How would that even 
set an example of a family to others or to 
the children involved in such a relation
ship? Yes, love is essential.
However, love is not the only purpose 
of a marriage, and here is where the case 
against gay marriage can be made. I do 
not doubt that there are loving, devoted 
gay couples in the world today  many 
more loving towards each other than some 
married couples are. This is only half the 
picture, though. Homosexual sex practic
es, regardless of what one thinks of them 
morally, are essentially non-procreative. 
Try as they may, there is no chance of a 
gay or lesbian couple conceiving a child

Kerry choice for technology-minded
Kirk Higgins
The one major campaign issue 
that is overlooked is how each 
candidate plans on advancing 
technology and making America 
more competitive in the world. 
Graduating from one' of the 
highest ranking engineering and 
computer science schools in the 
nation entails electing a govthree years in a row. He wants to 
cut other grants and low-interest federal loans, while increas
ing subsidies to banks to provide 
higher interest loans. Kerry has 
focused on closing the loopholes 
towards bank subsidies, which 
would help fund aid for college 
students. Kerry would offer 
state budgets a billion dollars in 
reserves to help contain tuition. 
He wants to offer a more expan
sive tax credit for college stu
dents to use for all four years of
ernment that will promote your 
school and your career goals. A 
CMU student should consider 
how each candidate plans to 
tackle making education more 
affordable, making a high-tech 
career more obtainable, and pro
moting a society with the highest 
quality of life.
Bushs administration issued a 
report praising outsourcing as a 
factor that will provide long-term 
benefits to the U.S. economy. In 
the face of dismal job recovery 
since the recession, Bush has had 
difficulty articulating a credible 
policy promising job growth. 
During the third Presidential 
debate, Bush could only suggest 
that voters who have difficulty 
finding work try to obtain a col
lege degree. Ironically, public 
and private colleges have raised 
tuition by over 10 and 5 percent, 
respectively, every year under 
Bush. Meanwhile, Bush has fro
zen the level of Pell grants and 
the Federal Work Study Program
college. Furthermore, he wants 
to look into offering civil or vol
unteer work to pay for college.
Bushs proposed fiscal year 
2005 budget projects cuts for 
the Department of Energy and 
Department of Commerce. This 
would kill several. grant initia
tives, such as the Advanced 
Technology Program, which 
funds research in information 
technology and developing soft
ware that allows manufacturing 
plants to retool and reconfigure 
quickly. The University of Alaska 
will lose its ability to research 
electronic cataloging and dis
tance learning technologies, 
which could bridge the technol
ogy gap between rural and urban 
communities. These cuts would 
burden efforts to upgrade our 
national labs and government 
technology infrastructure that, 
as seen from the widespread 
power outage in the northeast 
during the summer of 2003, is 
long outdated. According to the
Economist, America has slipped 
several spots in broadband 
technology and e-readiness 
since 2001. John Kerry under
stands that technological
advancement requires leader
ship willing to provide active 
promotion and funding for these 
initiatives in the same spirit as 
John F. Kennedy did with the 
aerospace industry.
Currently, Bush is unwilling to 
produce an energy policy beyond 
drilling into the Alaskan emer
gency oil reserves. Not address
ing a future energy crisis based 
on oil dependence is huge risk 
to America. Kerry has the most 
ambitious plan to modernize 
our energy policy of any recent 
presidential candidate. In 2002, 
Kerry co-sponsored a bill to pres
sure the automobile industry to 
finally raise fuel economy stan
dards again. Kerry currently 
offers a tax incentive to compa
nies that produce electric hybrid 
cars to offset expenses in explor
ing alternative energy. Kerry also 
promises to fund utilization and 
research of ethanol, a measure 
that has shown results and pro
vide a huge boost to the agricul
tural industry. The best means 
of raising energy efficiency is to 
offer decent competition to the 
dominating oil industry.
Forty-eight Nobel prize-win
ning scientists have enthusi
astically endorsed John Kerry 
because they know Kerry will 
base public policy on scientific 
discoveries, not political ideo
logues. More than five thousand 
scientists, including former Bush 
employees, have charged the cur
rent administration with manip
ulating, censoring, and abusing 
the process of scientific inquiry, 
especially within the scope of 
environment, public health, 
technology, and energy explora
tion. Kerry will bring all parties 
to the tab le and acknowledge 
their opinions before making 
decisions, as opposed to the cur
rent president who has ignored, 
withdrawn from, or dismantled 
advisory councils or interna
tional treaties that arrive at 
conclusions that disagree with a 
political agenda. America needs 
a government that will make 
the most infor med decision to 
improve our quality of life, not 
to cater to a radical or lobbying 
minority.
You and I have a vested inter
est in this school, which con
tributes heavily to the high-tech 
industry. It is simply no contest 
on which candidate will be more 
focused enabling more growth 
and economic opportunity in 
this field. America needs a presi
dent like John Kerry who will 
take risks and look into more 
innovative energy policies, will 
make informed decisions, and 
will invest the most in technol
ogy.
Kirk Higgins (khiggins@J is a 
sophomore in mechanical engi
neering and welcomes the response 
of the one person who read this. 
He hopes college students think 
about the election the same way 
they think about sex: Performance 
matters.
Bush best defender against terrorism
James Auwaerter
Assuming you havent been 
living in a cluster this whole 
year, you know that tomorrow is 
Election Day, that you should vote 
(if you can), yada yada yada. The 
College Democrats and College 
Republicans have been fighting 
for weeks, with the Libertarians 
and Greens working to remind 
people that they have candidates 
running. Thankfully, the election 
season is drawing (to a close. For 
the first time in months, the TV 
wont be filled with campaign 
ads. But thats after tomorrow. 
Today, its time for one last plug 
for President Bush.
There are obviously a lot of 
people out there who arent going 
to be convinced one way or the 
other. There are also some issues 
where there are clear differences 
between the candidates, and peo
ple who vote on these issues have 
clear-cut choices. If you favor 
abortion-on-demand, youll vote 
Kerry. If you dont want the fed
eral government funding embry
onic stem-cell research, youll 
vote for Bush. For those of you 
who are still on the fence, here 
are some reasons to vote Bush.
. President Bushs plans for 
improving public education go 
beyond the No Child Left Behind 
Act. By holding schools account
able for failing in their duties to 
students, No Child Left Behind 
has already worked to reduce the 
achievement gap between poorer 
and richer schools. Expanding 
this to secondary schooling and 
increasing the amount of money 
going to the Department of 
Education will continue along 
this path.
When it comes to individuals 
retaining control of their econom
ic freedoms, Bush has it all over 
Kerry. With plans ranging from 
private investment accounts in 
Social Security, to tax cuts allow
ing you more control of your own 
money, to reducing the number of 
regulations that stifle new busi
ness development, Bush gives 
power to the people, rather than 
the government.
Finally, the biggest question for 
this election  who will do a bet
ter job with the war on terror? We 
can see the sort of support John 
Kerry has from the international 
community:
I think Kerry would be much 
more willing to listen to the 
voices of people and of the rest 
of the world. But in the U.S., 
the Jewish lobby is very strong, 
and any American who wants to 
become president cannot change 
the policy towards Palestine radi
cally.  former Prime Minister 
of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad, 
who earlier called on- Muslim 
leaders to seek final victory over 
the Jews who rule this world by 
proxy.
God willing Bush will fall 
down by the hands of Fallujah. If 
John Kerry wins the election and 
withdraws the Americans troops 
from Iraq ... then we will not 
fight.  Ahmed, of the terror
ist group Army of Mohammed.
The president [Arafat] is frus
trated with Bushs policies.... 
The president [Arafat] thinks 
that Kerry will be much better 
for the Palestinian cause and for 
the establishment of a Palestinian 
state.  spokesmen for the 
Palestinian Authority.
In the end, Kerry wants to 
outsource the war on terror to 
the UN, rather than taking any 
responsibility on himself or the 
United States. This is nothing 
new  he said the same thing
affect the outcome, the answer is 
unequivocally no. While work
ing with allies to achieve goals 
is a goal of every President, it 
should not come at the cost of the 
United States security.
And Kerrys work has continu
ously worked to undermine the 
security of the United States. From 
voting against funding Reagans 
programs that bankrupted the 
Soviet Union (which he now 
lauds) to voting to reduce funding 
for intelligence (that he now says
to the Harvard Crimson after 
returning from Vietnam. Id 
like to see our troops dispersed 
through the world only at the 
directive of the United Nations. 
And back in 1994 when speak
ing about what would justify 
troops losing their lives interna
tionally: If you mean dying in 
the course of the United Nations 
effort, yes, it is worth that. If 
you mean dying American troops 
unilaterally going in with some 
false presumption that we can
is faulty) to voting against the first 
Gulf War (which he now uses as 
an example of the sort of multilat
eralism is needed), he has missed 
the mark time and again. When 
one cannot be trusted in smaller 
matters, how can he be trusted 
with greater responsibilities?

week. The best early present for 
him would be a vote for George W. 
Bush tomorrow.
Independent submissions from the community
Republican has to vote for John Kerry
WOaaSe8 We0e8mac
About a year ago I left 
Pittsburgh. I wasnt sure if Fd be 
back, but I was sure of one thing: 
I was sick of this town, sick of this 
school, and especially sick of the 
political apathy. I didnt feel con
nected here. I didnt feel like I was 
part of anything.
I also left CMU as a Republican 
who supported President Bush and 
the war in Iraq. In fact, my picture 
appeared on the Post-Gazettes 
website as a College Republican 
who stood with our President to 
rid Saddam Hussein of his alleged 
weapons of mass destruction. 
Many people came up to me that 
day and asked me why I supported 
the President; why I supported 
sending people my age to die in a 
foreign land; why I myself wasnt 
going over there to fight for what 
I believed in? I shrugged them off. 
In all honesty, I didnt know what 
to say.
Back then, millions of 
Americans, including me, had been 
deceived by what is now being 
called inaccurate intelligence. I 
had watched as Secretary of State 
Colin Powell made his appeal to 
the United Nations after months 
of inspections by UN weapons 
inspectors. I was convinced that 
the war in Afghanistan was going 
to hell and we ought to fight to 
oust a man who had no regard for
his people or the rule of law.
Today, Im compelled to believe 
that there were no weapons of mass 
destruction in Iraq. I no longer 
support this President. However, 
I do believe that for myself and 
countless other Americans at the 
time, it was very difficult to dis
agree with the President. Besides, 
wasnt he fighting the same mas
ters of terror who devastated our 
country on September 11, 2001? 
Wasnt he eliminating a man who 
had clear ties to, and funded, AlQaeda? Wasnt he doing the right 
thingthe only option after Hans 
Blix and his corps of inspectors 
had failed to find the WMDs?
No, no, and no. The Bush admin
istration acted out of frustration. 
At the time, U.S. troops faced 
great adversity in Afghanistan. 
Bush needed a quick and easy 
solution to boost morale for the 
war on terror. The administration 
picked Iraq. Convenient enough, 
right? After all, it was part of the 
Axis of Evil. But it wasnt Bush 
who picked Iraq. No, lucky for him
 the conservatives were there 
for him. This brings me to my 
main point  the think tanks.
David Frum, a former Bush 
speechwriter, and now a resident 
scholar at an ultra-conservative 
think tank called the American 
Enterprise Institute (AEI), coined 
the term Axis of Evil for President 
Bush. Frum is a member of the
neo-conservative movement, 
which supplies the rhetorical can
non fodder and research to jus
tify our policies. These policies are 
not the result of careful planning 
and analysis by our President and 
his staff. They are policies which 
we now know are not based in 
reality. Iraq was part of Frums 
axis of evil, the neo-conservative 
axis of evil.
Of course! How could we be so 
stupid? This war was waged based 
on a different reality than the one 
we know. You cant fault President 
Bush for placing his faith (and our 
soldiers lives) in an alternate real
ity, can you?
Yes, you can.
Why John Kerry? When I came 
back this fall and I attended that 
rally, I finally felt connected to 
something. At the Kerry rally that 
took place two weeks ago, I stood 
on the same grass where I had 
stood a short time earlier in favor 
of the war. I watched as thou
sands of blue-collar workers, pro
fessionals, students, professors, 
the elderly and disabled gathered 
around a man named John Kerry. 
I could feel their resolve, their 
anger at this President. I could 
hear John Kerrys hope and I felt 
myself nodding in agreement. 
That is why on November 2,1 will 
hold George Bush accountable for 
misleading our country down this 
dark road.
Judge candidates on character
WOaaSe8 !8O0e
I happened to catch an inter
esting segment presented on 
C-SPAN concerning the upcom-. 
ing election. The editor-at-large 
for Time Magazine, Nancy 
Gibbs, was speaking to a select 
group of high school students 
in New York City as part of a 
leadership lecture series. She 
began by describing her latest 
project: a comparison of the 
two Presidential candidates as 
young men. It was fascinating 
to hear her speak of their devel
opment through high school. 
Though they both grew up in 
similarly privileged lifestyles, 
she contrasted them by show
ing their differences in achieve
ment and personality.
Gibbs went on to say that 
everything you want to know 
about the two candidates you 
can learn from their respective 
high school experiences. What 
shaped these men? Where 
did they derive their leader
ship qualities? As she finished 
her introduction she said, I 
think those qualities matter 
even more than anything else 
that voters are going to learn 
about a candidate because his
tory inevitably hands us a sur
prise.
Nancy Gibbs is a journalist 
for one of the best-selling news
sources in the country. She has 
devoted her life to finding sto
ries that matter to the American 
people, yet she spoke to this par
ticular group of students about 
the candidates characters, not 
their stances on specific issues. 
We all have important positions 
on the issues that influence our 
vote one way or another, but I 
would hope each voters choice 
runs deeper than just a political 
party.
When President Bush and 
Senator Kerry step to the podi
um, they each represent much 
more than just their own ideas; 
in essence, they represent every 
one of us. I find myself con
sciously examining each sen
tence they speak not just for 
its content, but for the deliv
ery. Great leaders must unite 
people by connecting with the 
individual. With the passing of 
President Reagan, our coun
try paid tribute to Reagan the 
man, Reagan the leader  not 
Reagan the great Republican. 
His policy and actions will for
ever be disputed, but his power 
in front of the great American 
stage cannot be denied. The 
connection he developed with 
the American people stems 
from the very heart of his char
acter and conviction.
I write this to express my 
concern for how we vote. Ive
spoken with all sorts of people, 
Kerry and Bush fans alike. I fear 
most of us have overlooked the 
obvious reasons for choosing a 
president. The question I pose 
is not which candidate your 
opinions or views side with. 
The question is which candi
date is a better representative 
for America? After over a year 
of inner debate, I only see one 
choice for myself and for our 
country. John Kerry speaks to 
me as a man of resolute char
acter and sound mind. I tend to 
side more with the Democrats 
than the Republicans, but 
I choose John Kerry as my 
President for more than just the 
issues. When he stands before 
the podium, I see a man who 
has devoted his life to public 
service and leads with supe
rior knowledge and strength. 
President Bush may connect 
with many Americans due to 
his simple speech habits, but I 
only see this as a weakness. The 
debates were only further evi
dence of Kerrys authoritative 
use of knowledge combined 
with dominant character.
My vote goes to Senator Kerry, 
but I only hope that we all vote 
for more than just a party, more 
than just one issue. In this elec
tion, vote for the leader who 
embodies the spirit and charac
ter of the free world.

Moore controversy was already 
starting to heat up. It was stated 
that no conservative speakers, 
or libertarians for that matter, 
would agree to come speak, even 
though attempts to furnish this 
request have been made.
The argument that this con
troversy is exactly what our apa
thetic campus needs is entirely 
bogus. Carnegie Mellon needs 
debate and progress. Our cam
pus does not need a speaker 
that galvanizes the radicals. The 
polarization of causes, forcing 
the fringe groups farther out 
to their respective sides, is the 
last thing a devastatingly apa
thetic centrist population wishes 
to see. Carnegie Mellon needs 
responsible groups bringing in 
a wide range of speakers, not a 
small range of speakers all with 
the same political leanings.
Michael Moore used AB to get 
a political soapbox and a large 
sum of money from Carnegie 
Mellon students. One would be 
happy to know that huge hono
rarium or not, Moore was unin
terested in speaking at Carnegie 
Mellon after November 2. Moore 
mentioned to the audience that 
he was in the process of filming 
his new documentary attacking 
private health care and hospi
tals. The students and universi
ties involved across the country 
in bringing Moore in to speak 
at this most crucial time should 
know that their dollars are being 
well spent on faux documentary 
making and partisan politicking.

Same-sex benefits make economic sense
GAY RIGHTS, from All
quest for human enlightenment, 
could be more collegial and 
effective than promoting leg
islation to exempt itself from its 
own citys civil rights ordinance?
The claims made along the 
way have been equally disturb
ing. Opponents of the domes
tic partner benefits argued that 
homosexuals were asking for 
special treatment. Prior to the 
struggle for domestic partner 
health coverage, most health 
plans only covered married 
couples. This is, however, a clas
sic Catch-22. The same groups 
who say you need to be married 
to receive coverage, such as the 
Christian Coalition of America, 
are also opposed to gay mar
riage and civil unions. If we dont 
allow homosexuals to marry, and 
we only provide health benefits 
to those who are married, then 
how do we expect homosexuals
to obtain health coverage?
After years of ignoring such 
dilemmas, Nordenberg gallantly 
recognized his past wrongs and 
took the brave step of issuing 
the decision to grant domestic 
partner benefits by burying it in 
the middle of a September 1 uni
versity memo and couching his 
reasoning to grant those benefits 
in purely economic terms.
Noting that same-sex ben
efits are now being offered by 
most of Pitts peer institutions, 
Nordenberg made it clear that he 
was responding to competitive, 
and not moral, pressures.
Given historical precedent, it 
is not surprising that Pitt, or any 
other similar institution, would 
bask in its discriminatory bliss for 
so long. Just as it took decades 
of legal struggle and activism 
for African-Americans to win the 
basic civil rights for which they 
struggled so valiantly, it has been 
a long and protracted campaign
to bring about the granting of 
same-sex benefits.
And despite Pitts reluctance, 
and the fact that it has made the 
right choice for only competitive 
reasons, it shines in comparison 
to the several other local uni
versities that fail to rise to even 
that level.
Duquesne University, Robert 
Morris University, and Carlow 
College, resisting a call to join 
the twenty-first century, current
ly offer no such benefit packages 
for their employees.
In failing to do so, they are 
callously ignoring a simple 
point: Regardless of how one 
feels about homosexuals, samesex benefits make clear factual 
sense for all but the most die
hard social conservative who 
lacks even the faintest pretense 
of economic rationality  a cat
egory that apparently includes 
the administrative bodies of 
those schools.

WASTE, from A10
Institution of marriage needs protection
GAY MARRIAGE, from All
through their own sexual activi
ties. In fact, this distinction to nat
ural law theorists is what makes 
homosexual activity immoral.
Now, it should be easy to see 
why it is folly to admit couples 
into an institution if they have no 
ability or desire to perform half 
of what that institution demands. 
Granted, there are many straight 
couples who marry and have no 
desire for children. These priori
ties could always change, depend
ing on their situations in life. Also, 
there are already couples who 
simply cannot conceive a child. 
One could look at these couples, 
and see that a factor beyond their 
control is blocking them from 
having natural children. On the 
other hand, many homosexu
als, most prominently Governor 
McGreevey of New Jersey and 
Bishop Robinson of the Episcopal 
Church, have, at one point in their 
lives, naturally fathered children.
Some might point to technol
ogy, and show that homosexual 
couples should be admitted to 
marriage, by these standards, if 
they can conceive a child through 
other means. This is still inad
missible, as technologies such
as in-vitro fertilization and sur
rogate motherhood are fraught 
with ethical dilemmas all their 
own. What of the rights of the 
surrogate mother, or of her duties 
to the child she carries for some
one else? What of the obligations 
of a sperm donor toward the 
child he might not know he has 
fathered? Others might point to 
adoption as a solution to this dif
ficulty, and this suggestion does 
indeed have merit. Due to a fairly 
homogeneous familial structure 
in a homosexual partnership 
(two men or two women), a child 
would be deprived of her chance 
at having both a mother and a 
father. While this situation is not 
ideal, it certainly is better for the 
child than having her be passed 
between foster parents or left un
adopted.
Currently, our civil conception 
of marriage does not do much 
to recognize the natural law. 
It seems more concerned with 
Social Security benefits, legal 
rights, and tax breaks than with 
parenting, procreation, or com
panionship. This distorted per
spective has made it very easy for 
some to make the claim that gay 
partnerships need to be admit
ted to the definition of marriage.
Certainly, there is an element of 
fairness that needs to be fulfilled. 
However, if we ally our civil con
cept of marriage to the natural 
law, it becomes very clear that 
homosexual unions, whose very 
essence is non-procreative, should 
not be admitted to the institu- ' 
tion of marriage. If this proves 
to be unpopular, then a compro
mise position would be to remove 
the civil conception of marriage 
entirely, and let the churches and " 
civic groups decide who should 
marry whom. Perhaps in the dis
course this generates, a compro
mise could be reached. At the 
very least, this system prevents 
either side from imposing its will 
on the other.
Coming full circle, the University 
of Pittsburgh, as a semi-private 
institution, can extend partner
ship benefits to whomever it 
pleases. It should not even neces
sarily follow, though, that they 
should lose any state funding, 
at least for academic programs. 
However, I hope to have shown 
how permitting same-sex mar
riage in civil society as a whole 
would even further pervert an 
institution whose purposes have 
already been warped by public 
policy.
Hoeffel needed for 2006 campaign
SPECTER, from A10
that Bush believes he will. This 
seems like less a trick on Bush and 
more a trick on the Bush support
ers Specter needs on November 
2. Who knows? It may be the 
Post-Gazette (and myself) getting 
tricked. But his bipartisan efforts 
in the judicial arena aside the late 
Senator John Heinz speak oth
erwise, and if Hoeffel wins, who 
knows what Republican would 
stand between a second-term 
Bush and the Supreme Court?
Finally, and perhaps most 
abstractly, Specter is the senior 
Senator from Pennsylvania, a 
title of great honor and distinc
tion. Should Hoeffel win, that
title will be taken by the odi
ous Senator Rick Santorum, who 
has campaigned on little more 
than family values in the past, 
while comparing homosexual 
acts to bestiality in the present. 
Santorum is already among the 
most powerful men in Congress, 
so the fact that junior precedes 
his title is little consolation. But 
perhaps it will keep his resume 
modest come Election 2006, or 
worse yet 2008, when hell surely 
make a bid for the Presidency 
against a field of Republicans 
and, hopefully, the incumbent 
John Kerry.
Which brings me to my final 
point: Pennsylvania needs
a strong candidate in 2006 to
get Santorum out. But who 
will be the man to do it? What 
Democrat has the name recog
nition, the reasonable platform, 
and the intact campaign to finish 
the creep off? You guessed it: Joe 
Hoeffel. If Hoeffel wins, who will 
beat Santorum in 06?
So in two years, vote for Joe 
Hoeffel: a man whose name is not 
synonymous with sexual byprod
uct, a man who looks like the cen
trist of the year next to Santorum, 
a man whos getting some good 
practice this year  but not my 
vote.

Womens soccer splits games
by Khalid El-Arini
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team got their ninth and 
10th wins this week, but dropped 
a key conference match up that 
will make it tough for the team 
to advance to the NCAA tourna
ment. Their three game road-trip 
consisted of wins against Penn 
State Behrend and New York 
University, and a loss to Brandeis 
University. The Tartans are now
3-2-1 against University Athletic 
Association (UAA) teams. The 
teams overall record stands at 
10-2-3. They are currently ranked 
27th nationally for Division III 
schools.
The Tartans traveled to Erie, 
Pa., on October 21 to face the 
regionally ranked Behrend Lions 
team. The Lions came into the 
game with thirteen yellow cards 
and three red cards on the season, 
so sportsmanship from the home 
squad was not necessarily to be 
expected. Carnegie Mellon head 
coach Heather Kendra labeled it 
a sloppy game, which was also a 
reference to the muddy field and 
slippery playing conditions.
The first Tartan goal came as 
sophomore midfielder Ashley 
McMakin slid a pass between 
two Behrend defenders to junior 
forward Hallie Dumont, who put 
Carnegie Mellon up 1-0. Later 
in the game, Behrends goal
keeper could not control a shot 
from sophomore midfielder Lisa 
Pascoli, and Dumont made her 
pay for the mistake by logging her 
second goal of the afternoon as 
she poked the ball into the back 
of the net. The third goal came 
off of a direct kick from 25 yards 
out, as first-year fullback Amanda 
Rose hit the ball just inside the 
far post.
Our offense did a good job fol
lowing up shots on their keepers 
rebounds, said senior goalkeeper 
Megan Monroe. The Lions did not 
register many shots, but when 
they did, Monroe made the key 
saves.
It was an important win 
because they were 10-3, and 
ranked in the Great Lakes region, 
said Kendra. It was a good 
regional victory for us.
Dumont and Rose were both 
named Top Performers by the 
UAA this week for their solid play 
against the Lions. Roses goal was
her first career goal as a Tartan.
On Friday, the Tartans traveled 
to Riverbank State Park in upper 
Manhattan to face New York 
University, and defeated them by 
a final score of 1-0. Junior mid
fielder Nadya Yaghoubi scored 
the game-winner at the start 
of the second half, as her shot 
deflected off the goalkeepers 
hands and found the back of the 
net. Carnegie Mellon outshot the 
Violets 13-6, as Monroe logged 
her tenth shutout of the year.
Yesterday, the Tartans traveled 
to Boston to face Brandeis, and 
suffered a tough 2-0 loss in a 
hard fought conference match 
up. Both of the Judges goals 
came in the first half, and despite 
a 22-10 shot advantage for the 
Tartans, the visitors were not able 
to tally any goals. The loss drops 
Carnegie Mellon to fourth in the 
UAA standings, with one game 
left to play.
The Tartans will finish up their 
regular season next week at home, 
as they host Emory University at 
Gesling Stadium. Emory is cur
rently ranked second in the UAA 
with a 5-1-0 conference record. 
The home game is scheduled for 
an 11 am start.
Mens XC takes second in UAA contest
by Andrea Garvue
Layout Staff
This weekend, the Carnegie 
Mellon mens cross country team 
competed at the UAA champion
ships in Rochester, New York. 
Carnegie Mellon placed third 
out of the eight schools with a 
total score of 80 points, losing 
to Washington University, which 
scored 60, and the University of 
Chicago, which had a score of 59. 
Carnegie Mellon had four run
ners place in the top 25 : Nick End 
in fourth, Dana Irrer in eighth, 
Aaron Beaber in 20th (with a per
sonal record of 27:17), and Geoff 
Misekin 22nd.
The race was 8 kilometers long
and had a total of 75 runners 
competing. The course was flat 
for the most part, but extremely 
muddy and soft, according to 
Misek, making it especially hard 
to run, although the team had 
had prior racing experience on 
that course.
It was difficult to run in a pack 
because of the mud and all the 
sharp turns. We werent able to 
run the way we planned because 
of the mud and weather and we 
were a little disappointed with 
our team race. We were constant
ly getting spiked by other runners 
because the lead pack was so big. 
The race thinned out in the fourth 
mile and Dana and I pushed to 
stay up front, said End, who fin
ished fourth.
Although the mens team felt 
disappointed with its race results, 
they had a disadvantage this year 
running without one of their top 
runners, Matt Meurer, who is out 
due to an injury. The cross coun
try teams will next compete at 
the Regional Championship at 
Allegheny. As a whole, the team 
didnt really run as well as we 
expected it to, but were just put
ting that behind us and focusing 
on regionals now, said Misek. 
The team is currently ranked sec
ond in the region, and if they 
are able to maintain this rank
ing and place in the top two at 
Allegheny in two weeks, they will 
once again be able to compete 
in the National Championship at 
Eau Claire, Wise.

Mens soccer wins 
four close matches
by John Gross
Layout Staff
These past two weeks have 
been tough, but victorious for the 
mens soccer team, as they batded and won against four differ
ent teams, Including Grove City 
College 3-2, St. Vincent College
4-3, Westminster College 3-1, 
and New York University 1-0.
On October 20, the Tartans 
traveled to Grove City, Pa., to 
compete against the Grove City 
Wolverines. In the fourth min
ute, Dan Mastalski scored with 
an assist by Jonathan Browne. 
Just past the 14th minute, the 
Tartans scored again with a goal 
by Sean Filipovitz. During a pen
alty kick in the 22nd minute, 
Wolverine Adam Ludwig scored 
against Tartan goalkeeper Dave 
Thomas, which sealed up the 
first half 2-1 for the Tartans. 
In the 73rd minute, Browne 
scored his first, last and gamewinning goal of the night, with 
an assist by James Steidel. With 
eight minutes left in the game, 
Wolverine Stuart McCommas 
found the back of the net behind 
Thomas, finishing the game 3-2 
for the Tartans.
The Tartans hosted the St. 
Vincent College (Pa.) Bearcats on 
October 23 at Gesling Stadium. 
In the 26th minute, Bearcat for
ward Dave Suski found the back 
of the net giving St. Vincent 
the initial lead. In the 30th 
and 46th minutes, the Tartans 
fought back with goals scored 
by Chris Watts and Mastalski, 
respectively. Finishing up the 
half, Suski scored consecutively 
in the 57th and 62nd minutes, 
with Mike Steffa scoring a point 
for the Tartans before the elapse 
of the half. Two sudden-death 
overtime periods occurred, and 
in the 102nd minute, last years 
UAA Rookie of the Year, Browne, 
scored the game-winning goal 
which sealed this hard-fought 
victory for the Tartans.
For the second time this sea
son, Browne was named the 
University Athletic Association 
Mens Soccer Athlete of the 
Week. This award recognized 
Browne for his performance 
against the Wolverines and 
Bearcats where he scored both 
game winning goals as well as 
aiding the team in three assists.
On Tuesday, the Tartans 
hosted the Westminster College 
(Pa.) Titans at Gesling Stadium. 
The game proved more chal
lenging than anyone would 
have thought, as spectators 
saw players such as Steidel, 
Mastalski, and Steve Berei sit
on the bench throughout the 
games duration. Primarily 
sophomore and first-year play
ers competed in the game, mak
ing it much more interesting for 
spectators. Within the first ten 
minutes, Browne scored his first 
goal of the night with an assist 
by Filipovitz. In the 37th min
ute, Titan forward Mark Sadler 
kicked the ball past Thomas, 
with an assist by Zach Saxman. 
In the 54th minute William 
Schlough found the back of the 
net, with another assist by Sean 
Filipovitz. In the 58th minute, 
Browne scored his second goal 
of the night, personally setting 
the Carnegie Mellon record for 
most goals scored in a single 
season.
The Tartans traveled to upper 
Manhattan on Friday to compete 
against the New York University 
Violets in a UAA match-up. Both 
teams played extremely physi
cal because of the implications 
of this game affect both teams 
futures in the UAA conference. 
However, with all the intensity, 
neither team scored within the 
two 45- minute halves.Two 
minutes and 30 seconds into the 
first overtime Browne scored 
the game-winning goal for the 
Tartans, for the third time in 
four games. The Tartans outshot 
the Violets 15-10 and left New 
York with a 10-1-3 record and 
current UAA record 2-0-3.
Six players from the mens 
soccer team were named to the 
University Athletic Associations 
All-Academic Recognition list. 
The players are seniors Dave 
Thomas, Alex Beck, Mike Steffa, 
and Brett Holmes, and sopho
mores Jonathan Browne and 
Rob Vargo.
On Sunday afternoon, the 
Tartans competed against the 
Brandeis University Judges 
shutting them out 2-0 in a piv
otal UAA match. This is the fifth 
game of the season that the 
Tartans shut out another team.
With regard to the team's 
season this year, Steidel said, 
Overall, out team is doing well. 
We dominate games in shots on 
goals and corners and scoring 
opportunities, we have just been 
unlucky.
Our toughest game will defi
nitely be against Emory, said 
Steidel. Last year, we beat them 
on their own turf with a man 
down... they are going to be out 
for blood.
On Sunday the Tartans will 
play their final regularly sched
uled season game at Gesling 
Stadium against one of their 
toughest rivals, the Emory 
University Eagles.
The Red Sox won it and 
nobody can take it away
WO0h -2e0GOo
The last time a newspaper 
reported that the Red Sox 
would win the World Series, 
Johannes Gutenberg decided it 
wasnt newsworthy and put it 
below the fold. A World Series 
victory is the greatest thing 
since sliced bread, which, for 
the record, was invented after 
the next most recent time the 
Red Sox won the Series.
In all honesty, I was not sure 
that this would ever happen in 
my lifetime. I had gotten my 
hopes up at the beginning of the 
playoffs, thinking this would be 
the year, yet I knew, just like 
every other Red Sox fan, that 
hoping was merely part of the 
game. In classic baseball fash
ion the Sox would get close, 
the Yankees would knock them 
around, the Sox would pull close 
and then lose it at the end.
Yet something amazing hap
pened: the Sox forgot how to 
lose. It was like watching a gam
bling addict bet his life savings 
on a roulette wheel and win.
This is how the curse had to 
end: The Sox had to beat the 
Yankees and in style. As impor
tant as the World Series was, we 
knew that if the Sox didnt beat 
the Yankees, a championship 
would somehow be hollow. Yet 
the actual game 7 of the ALCS 
and the final three games of 
the World Series lacked much 
drama as far as baseball goes.
Yet there were two games 
being played simultaneously 
every evening with only one of
them on the field. The other 
game was between the Red Sox 
Nation and baseball history, with 
this game as close as they get.
This is why every Red Sox fan 
acts like he plays a part in the 
teams success. Somehow the 
Red Sox were able to take on his
tory, look it straight in the eye, 
and beat it. Having superheroes 
like Curt Schilling on your team 
doesnt hurt either.
It is nearly impossible to 
describe what it feels like to win 
this game against history. For so 
long Red Sox fans have watched 
and hoped, never giving up 
hope, and as soon as the Sox 
would lose we would tell each 
other to just wait another year.
For decades Red Sox fans have 
found the ability to hope, have 
found the ability to find joy in 
a team that has done nothing 
but break their hearts. They 
remained our team through 
thick and thin and we continued 
to believe in them despite know
ing that we would never see the 
day when the Sox won it all. 
Somehow the Red Sox Nation 
found something worth believ
ing in. This is about more than 
just baseball, this is about the 
human spirit finding the hope to 
keep on dreaming.
I woke up Thursday morning 
and the Red Sox were World 
Series champions. I never 
thought that would happen; I 
kept thinking that it would be 
cancelled, like Florida on elec
tion night 2004.1 still cant quite 
believe that it happened and 
nobody can take this one away.

Saw gives audiences a fright
Horror movie is full of twists and turns
The problem with psychological thriller/horror/ 
serial killer movies is that they've been done be
fore. Most everyone who sees Saw, the new psy
chological thriller from first time director James 
Wan, will draw immediate comparisons to David 
Finchers quintessential genre film, Se7en. The 
films share many elements; however, Saw doesnt 
quite live up to the latter on any level. It does ev
erything well, but nothing great.
The concept behind Saw may be one of this films 
best qualities. Much like Se7en, there is a serial 
killer on the loose trying to show mankind the er
ror of its wicked ways. However, the twist is that 
Jigsaw, Saws mysterious madman, hasnt actu
ally killed anyone. Instead, Jigsaw traps each vic
tim in a sadistic, meticulously organized trap that 
forces them to kill themselves (or someone else) 
to get out. One man is trapped in a razor wire 
jungle and has to tunnel his way out. Another is 
forced to read, by candlelight, a long safe combi
nation written on the walls of his cell in order to 
access the antidote to a poison in his blood. Oh 
yeah, and hes covered in flammable goo, just to 
make it interesting. A woman has to sift through 
the entrails of her dead cellmate to find a key to 
unlock a reverse bear-trap strapped to her jaws, 
and if the time runs out before she does, her face 
will be ripped apart.
These victims are all just ancillary details, though, 
that come in to give a bit of background to the 
main plot. Saw opens in the grungiest bathroom 
imaginable, with two men chained to pipes on 
either side. There is a dead body in a big pool 
of blood in the middle. Needless to say, the two 
men are a bit freaked out. Adam (co-writer Leigh 
Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, 
of Princess Bride fame) cant remember how they 
got there, wherever there is, and they certainly 
cant figure out how to get out. The background 
of the Jigsaw killer, and the two mens connec
tion to him, are revealed throughout the movie as 
flashbacks, and through the subplot of Detective 
David Tapp (Danny Glover), a burnt out ex-cop 
who has been tracking Jigsaw since the begin
ning of the killers diabolical games.
As it turns out, Adam and Lawrence are in quite a 
pickle. Jigsaw is holding the Gordon family hos
tage, and informs the protagonists that unless 
Lawrence kills Adam by 6 pm, his family will die. 
And the only way to escape their shackles is to saw
their feet off. Lawrence has both a gun (tantalizingly out of reach) and the poison-filled blood of 
the dead man on the floor to try and kill Adam 
with. Of course its not really that simple.
Any more plot exposition would, at this point, 
spoil the entire story. Saw is full of plot twists, 
some more ridiculous than others, with one mas
sive twist at the end that will likely make or break 
the film for most viewers. Many people are saying 
the movie is worth seeing just for this final climax, 
and it truly is a plot twist of a magnitude not often 
seen in movies these days.
Unfortunately, every aspect of the film is not as 
engaging as the story. The acting is, in general, 
very generic. Whannell plays his role with an ap
propriate edginess, but his performance does not 
always really click. Danny Glovers character is 
not fleshed out enough, but his borderline obses
sion remains interesting to watch throughout the 
movie. Cary Elwes makes a good even-handed 
foil for Whannells character in the first half of 
the film, but as his sanity begins to wane, he be
comes less and less believable. Elwes acting his
tory makes it hard to fully accept this role  it 
gets hard not to imagine Princess Brides Wesley 
giving some of his lines.
The atmosphere in Saw is what really makes it 
scary. The movie keeps the bleak, grimy palette 
that Se7en did so well, and the directors worked 
in some genuinely disturbing imagery that goes 
for more cerebral scares. There is plenty of gore, 
too, but not so much that it gets distracting. And 
like any good scary movie, there are two or three 
jump-out-of-your seat moments, including a 
particularly jarring scene in Adams pitch-black 
apartment intermittently lit by his cameras flash 
bulb.
Saw is a great first entry by James Wan, and defi
nitely one of the more memorable serial-killerbased psychological thrillers in recent years. It 
is not without its flaws, but is definitely worth a 
look if youre in for a good scare. See if you can 
guess the ending before it comes  youll be sur
prised.

Zyng has no zing
Newest Asian restaurant in Squirrel Hill does not live up to its image
Momo Kitagawa/Photo Staff
Ariel Brice, Ronen Gal-or, and Julie Medina sample some of Zyngs mediocre cuisine.
Zyng
1712 Murray Avenue 
Squirrel Hill
Zyng, a national chain with more than 14 locations 
around the country, has recendy opened a branch in 
Squirrel Hill. The chains website promises an exciting, 
fresh, vibrant, contemporary dining experience, but 
dont be fooled: Zyngs bark is bigger than its bite.
Conveniendy located next to the new Rite Aid at Forbes 
and Murray, Zyngs flashy exterior is that of a hip bis
tro. Its interior is quite pleasant, with Chinese-inspired 
murals and bamboo arrangements placed around the 
restaurant. The atmosphere is something like the Olive 
Garden  pleasant but not too intimate. The floor is tiled 
in a manner reminiscent of a fast-food restaurant, but 
the booths and tables are set up as in a medium-budget 
restaurant.
Upon being seated, my party was told by our waitress 
that we were sitting in the Tao center of the restaurant 
and that according to feng shui we would have a balanced 
meal. When all six people in my dinner party stared at 
her blankly, she explained that the whole restaurant 
had been surveyed by a feng shui expert. Her declaration 
proved to be wrong  dinner at Zyng was anything but 
balanced.
The menu at Zyng is somewhere between a PF Changs 
and a Tech Street food truck. Everything is cheap  
remarkably so. Zyng has a wine list where all the wine is 
$4-$6 a glass and no bottle is over $20. In fact, for $20 
one person can get an alcoholic drink, an appetizer, an 
entree, and some tea, as I did. Nothing on the menu is 
over $10. While initially this was exciting as it indicated 
the possibility of ordering more, I was soon disappointed. 
Zyngs menu features many items made popular by the 
more upscale Chinese chain PF Changs. For example, 
Changs signature appetizer, the Mu Shu lettuce wrap, 
which consists of spiced tofu or chicken served in cold 
lettuce cups, was appropriated by Zyng. Zyng succeeds 
in making an otherwise innovative and delicious dish 
extremely bland and boring. The filling for the Zyng let
tuce wraps was essentially a warm mush which had to 
be liberally coated with duck sauce to reclaim any sem
blance of flavor.
Other menu choices such as the Zyngs Shock o Chocolate 
cake are similar to the Changs equivalents  in this case 
the Great Wall of Chocolate Cake. The martini menu at 
Zyng similarly tries to recreate Changs reputation for 
exotic drinks. One of their house drinks, Zangria, was 
especially bad  a bizarre combination of orange juice,
Sierra Mist, and merlot.
Zyng does not succeed in becoming a budget version of 
PF Changs, having dishes that sound better than they 
actually taste, and a combination of decor and menu that 
leave customers confused as to how they should react. Is 
it a restaurant or a takeout place?
My group sampled the crispy egg rolls, the lettuce wraps, 
the pot stickers, and the Princes Wonton Soup as appe
tizers. All of them were the most generic versions of those 
foods that we had ever tasted. The soup was too salty; 
one of us likened it to Cup ONoodles. The egg roll wrap
pers were thick and greasy, and the dumplings lacked 
any flavor other than the soy sauce they were dipped in. 
Zyngs food could not even be properly compared to that 
of a shopping mall food court, where the food is greasy 
and salty but tasty as a result.
I trudged through the menu, sampling the Thai fried rice 
bowl and a Cantonese noodle meal-in-bowl, becoming 
more and more discouraged as I went. Zyngs most popu
lar entree is its meal-in-bowl, a customization option 
where the customer chooses the type of protein (beef, 
chicken, tofu, etc.), the type of noodles or rice, and the 
sauce. The customer can then choose to go with the 
chefs selection of veggies, or go to a veggie bar to make 
a customized selection. The chef then prepares the entire 
concoction on a Teppan grill. These meals-in-bowls dem
onstrated the fact that Asian foods are not interchange
able. My selection of shrimp, wheat noodles, and sesame 
garlic ginger sauce resulted in something that looked and 
tasted like a student-made stir fry with a bottle of storebought brown sauce. The yakisoba sauce was equally
unappealing, but with a sweeter taste. Of the six people 
in my party, all of whom ordered different entrees, all 
agreed that their own entres of classic Asian dishes they 
had evg were some of the worst renditions of classic 
Asian dishes they had ever tasted. Zyng falls through the 
culinary cracks and crashes. Its neither upscale Chinese, 
nor classic bad-for-you-yet-delicious takeout. Its a failed 
hybrid.
After the appetizers and entrees, nobody wanted dessert, 
even though the waitress was kind enough to bring out a 
choosing platter. Zyng has a small exotic-leaf tea menu, 
so I decided to give it a try by choosing the guava leaf tea. 
Surprisingly, the tea was excellent. True to name, it was 
brewed fresh, and was an interesting balance of black tea 
and sweet guava leaves. The tea was by far the best part 
of the Zyng menu.
In truth, Carnegie Mellon students may enjoy this place. 
There is a degree of customization in the noodle bowls 
that is very appealing to people who want their food 
cooked to exact specifications. And for a sit-down restau
rant, its cheap. But be warned, Zyng is not as great as it 
looks; The food is bland, uninspired, and certainly not 
authentic Asian. Better Asian food can be had all over 
Pittsburgh from Squirrel Hills numerous other Asian 
establishments or even from our own food trucks on Tech 
Street.

Big Als Metal Shop
The return of two classic bands to the metal scene
Two of metals biggest personalities have released new 
work recently. Megadeth released The System Has Failed 
from Sanctuary Records, and Machine Head released 
Through the Ashes of Empires from Roadrunner Records. 
Both are comeback albums of sort: efforts to recapture 
past glory and somehow bury their less-than-stellar 
recent catalogue. Both are California thrash titans, 
and both made ill-fated moves toward the mainstream 
these last few years. One makes a stunning musical 
move forward, while the other isnt bad either.
Though it may seem unfair to review one album 
against another, Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) has a lot 
in common with Robb Flynn (Machine Head) these 
days. If any band defines the California Thrash sound 
of the 80s, its Megadeth (along with Exodus and of 
course Metallica). Similarly, Machine Head injected 
new viciousness into the Cali scene with the shotgun 
blast that is Burn My Eyes. As far as debuts go, Burn My 
Eyes is one of those rare albums that defines a band as 
a heavyweight contender after a single jab.
But something happened to both bands in the late 90s. 
Mustaine regarded Metallicas (well, Lars) assertion 
that Mustaine took no risks musically as a challenge, 
and recorded Risk. This song sucked like you have 
no idea. There are some gold nuggets, but by and 
large this is unlistenable alterna-metal. Then Machine 
Head released The Burning Red, that took the band far 
away from its classic thrash sound. 2001 brought new 
albums from both, with Megadeths The World Needs a 
Hero, an earnest return to the fold but sounding like a 
band at a crossroads in their career. Machine Heads 
Supercharger was not the statement their first album 
was, but not terrible either.
Sadly, Dave severely hurt his arm shortly afterwards, 
leaving him unable to play, and retired from music 
altogether. The Head saw their guitarist leave and 
their label turn their back on them. While Dave slowly 
rehabbed his arm and learned, effectively, to play 
again, Flynn and company went back to the draw
ing board and redefined who they were as musi
cians. Mustaine, buoyed by the rapid revival of his 
skills, attempted to record with the classic lineup 
from the Rust in Peace era for his return to music. 
Unfortunately, this didnt work out, so he dug deep into 
Megadeths past and retrieved Chris Poland from the 
Jazz world. Polands unique style shines through, and 
his solos shred alongside Mustaines. Blackmail The 
Universe, Kick The Chair, and Back in The Day all 
evoke memories of Megadeths great history. Yet, I still 
see Mustaine searching for a firm musical direction. 
Die Dead Enough and The Scorpion both divulge 
Daves desire to crack the mainstream with their hooky 
melody. As a whole, the album feels like a tribute to
Megadeth fans who love the band no matter who plays 
with Mustaine. If this is the last album for Dave under 
the Megadeth moniker, then it is indeed a fitting sendoff.
Machine Head, on the other hand, has produced a 
visionary album that will stand along classics in the 
thrash genre for years to come. With their backs 
against the wall, no American label to speak of, and 
no lead guitarist, Flynn and company have created 
a work of art that infuses their sonic palette with 
unlikely influences. Instead of the usual rap or hip-hop, 
Machine Head reaches into the 70s via Rush. With an 
eye towards complex arrangement, Machine Head pro
duces seven-minute epics that lure the listener to the 
very last note, with mid-song tempo changes and com
plex riffs incorporated to dizzying effect. Every section 
of every song follows a labyrinthine progression that 
makes perfect sense upon completion. The effect is 
only thickened by the agony of Flynns life experiences 
revealed in his lyrics.
Initially, Roadrunner USA refused to release this album 
stateside. To their credit, they released the album in 
other parts of the world, and were astounded by its suc
cess. Metal fans, it seems, know genius when they see 
it. With a little egg on their face, Roadrunner USA has 
rushed out the album to American fans who had been 
buying this album on import. Its funny how a band has 
to go overseas to make their point clear.
TTAOE is not just the return of a band to their old 
stomping grounds, but a worthy contribution to the 
evolution of metal. As joyous as their live shows 
have been here in the U.S. in support of this album, 
their record was meant to be studied with a pair of 
headphones and a glass of water. Layer upon layer of 
intricate arrangements reveal themselves as you lose 
yourself in this work.
As I tap out this review, the next tempo change kicks in 
on In the Presence of My Enemies. This is the eighth 
time Ive heard the song in the past week, and it still 
knocks me to the floor each time.
Until next week, let freedom ring with a shotgun 
blast!

Zatoichi

This movie finally provides an answer to what all those ninjas 
do when they arent flipping out and killing people  they work 
as massage artists. Zatoichi wanders about and ends up killing a 
lot of people while helping out two geisha. Apparently, he cant 
remember the first rule of massage: Dont use swords on your 
clients. Zatoichi is also supposed to be blind, but we all know 
that there is only one true blind ninja  Snake Eyes of G.I. Joe. 
And knowing is half the battle.

This is the sort of movie that makes my head hurt. A woman 
married to a criminal chef (yay cannibalism) has an affair with 
a bookseller (yay books). Then, you add symbolism out the 
wazoo, some murder and sex, and a splash of torture (which 
may come before or after the murder) and what do you get? An 
allegory for Thatcherism. This is why I dont like deconstruc
tionism.
The Animation Show

A collection of animated shorts from the guy who created Beavis and Butthead. Theres only so much you can expect from 
that. In my case, I expected something stupid and unfunny. It 
seems I was wrong about the first, though the second is still up 
for debate. If this thing is successful, we might see it become 
an annual thing. If it becomes annual, I hope they get rid of the 
meatball mascot. Meatballs should not be animated.

Want to be surprised? What do you think happens when you 
eat at McDonalds three times a day for a month, choosing only 
the least healthy items and largest portions? Would you have 
guessed that you gain weight, raise your blood pressure, and 
generally become a huge sack of goo? You would have? Never 
mind.

Fredalba freely flows through genres
Uptown Music for Downtown Kids makes for a complete meal
Some people love a good picnic, a potluck dinner, a 
Thanksgiving-style affair with a little bit of everything. 
Listening to the debut CD of Fredalba can be just like a 
potluck. Someone brought vegetarian chili, Aunt Nancy 
brought pad thai, you followed up with strawberry rhu
barb pie. In the same mixture of flavors, Fredalba makes 
a precocious effort towards blending many different 
genres in their album Uptown Music for Downtown Kids. 
The creation of these sound blending skills seems more 
understandable when one reads the bands bios, or bet
ter yet talks to them. Surprisingly, it is as interesting to 
read Fredalbas personal bios as it is to speak to Fredalbas members.
The biographies on the website (www.fredalba.com) are 
written by the band members themselves, and most con
tain an interesting humorous touch. For example, Eric 
Balfour, the groups lead vocalist, says in his bio: Before 
my sister was born we spent a lot of time up in Big Sur at 
this place Esalin, its basically a hippy commune, but it 
was pretty cool cause there was always women walking 
around naked. Tiffin Rooster Roley (guitar) has simi
lar flair in his bit, describing how he got into music from 
the 60s and 70s with an anecdote about how he went 
to a concert with Guns n Roses and the Stones. Roley 
writes, Long story shortGnR sucked and the Stones 
killed it. From then on Ive been a big fan of 60s and 
70s rock.
Fredalba contains six members, only two of 
whom are from outside California, and have a 
sounds that spans across a humongous range.
When asked, theyll gladly provide many stories 
about how the members got together. Balfour and 
Doley are the only remaining original members; 
they met each other on a snowboarding trip. Dur
ing the conference call interview, Charmian Callon, 
the groups floutist and the only female member of 
the band, said that the groups members usually met 
through friends or friends of friends. True to 
the bands wild nature, Blair Shotts, 
the drummer, says that the band 
found him: I was sort of wan
dering the hills and valleys 
like Rasputin did back in the 
day. Shotts later admitted 
that the real way he got as
sociated was through an 
advertisement that the 
band had placed, look
ing for a drummer. He is 
one of the two non-Califor
nian members, hailing from 
Alabama.
The first three tracks of Uptown Music go through many 
different styles with an underlying hip-hop beat. The first 
track, Funk Exploration, lives up to its name. Though 
there are distinct Latin influences in their other songs, 
this is the only song that is sung almost entirely in Span
ish. Funk Exploration ends abruptly; unfortunately, 
this is not the case with some of the other tracks, which 
seem to drag out with far too many repetitions of the cho
rus. The second track, titled Leaders of the Wasteland, 
continues to sound similar to hip-hop, and the lyrics are 
strewn with social commentary with lines such as Is it 
wrong to break the rules/When the rules are made for 
breaking/if you go and ask Bill Clinton/What is sexual 
relation. The sounds are decidedly bubbly, a huge con
trast to the lyrics. The sounds are like a more ambient 
version of an organ pipe from the 60s. Later, during the 
chorus, the music becomes more contemporary, with a 
large increase in the scratching. Gimme More rounds 
out the top three tracks with a quick introduction to the 
sound of Charmian Callons flute. The chorus of this 
track and the entire sound in general is far from hip-hop; 
it is punctuated by the happy flute, and the lyrics to the 
chorus are a simple series of la-las. 
This is the first track on the CD, 
but not the last, that drives 
its chorus into the ground 
by repeating those la-las 
far too many times.
The band addressed 
their unusual mixture 
of sounds, which in lat
er tracks goes through 
even more metamor
phosis, by saying, 
With the first album 
we were experiment
ing with a lot of differ
ent sounds. In some ways 
I feel its a little
scattered. But I think we sort of evolved since the record
ing of the album.... I think youll see on the next record 
that... it will be more cohesive.
Maybe so, but it is hard to see past the diverse EP with 
songs that change rapidly in within single song from 
modern to old, turntable scratching to soft fluting. With 
twelve tracks in all, the album makes for an enormous 
amount of possibilities. The fourth track, Get Up, has 
almost come full circle from hip-hop. It conjures the soft 
sounds of a ballad at one minute into the track, but the 
chorus is reminiscent of a harder-sounding genre, some
thing one might expect from the likes of Linkin Park. 
While the lyrics arent as tiresome as Gimme More, the 
continuous guitar riffblessedly dropped at the bridge
 is almost as bothersome as the other tracks la-las. 
Prepare to Reactivate, the fifth track, is one of my fa
vorites on this CD, though it has a random Radioheadesque computer voice chanting the title throughout the 
song. It makes a sad attempt at copying the great Pink 
Floyd with its ambient mechanical noises at the exit, but 
it is otherwise a fresh and nice mixture of trance sounds 
with a harder vocal accompaniment. It is immediately 
followed by one of the few slow songs on the CD, Man 
of Progression, a bland track that whimpers on and on 
for four and half minutes. This tracks best features are 
the flute pieces interspersed.
In all, the CD has some great tracks that offer everyone 
a chance to experience a little bit of their favorite genre. 
Fredalba has offered a talented display of its diversity but 
the length of the tracks weigh the album down. Though 
they have a distinct Red Hot Chili Peppers flavor, in
dicative of their Los Angeles roots, Fredalba in no way 
becomes a copycat. After all, the group performs every
thing from a Spanish rhythm to a Rob Zombie-sounding 
song interspersed with a Madonna-from-Erotica sound. 
Listeners will have trouble getting hold of Fredalbas 
sound; the band merely teases its listeners with the pure 
versions of different genres, and leaves them unsatisfied. 
If you like everything, then put on your bib when you lis
ten to this album. Its going to be a messy feast with a 
little bit of everything.

What About the Environment?
Andrew Revkin speaks on the woes of reporting on science and the environment
Andrew Revkin, an environment reporter for The New York 
Times, spoke on October 21 about the hazards of report
ing on issues of science and the environment. His lecture 
was a part of the Distinguished Lecture Series, focusing 
on environmental science, technology and policy. Revkin 
has authored several books, including Global Warming 
and Understanding the Forecast, and he is an adjunct 
faculty member at Columbia University. His most recent 
book, The Daily Planet: Why the Media Stumble Over the 
Environment, formed the basis of the lecture he gave at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Revkin started by highlighting why journalism is such 
a vital force in the world. He claimed that journalism is 
the closest thing we have to a temperature gauge on the 
truth. Revkin noted, however, that journalism has pre
sented many challenges to the field of environmental
ism. To give some background on why such issues are of 
interest to him, Revkin spoke about his history, detailing 
the unusual way that he came into journalism  writing 
books first and then writing for news publications, rather 
than the reverse.
He said that his first desire to write came from trips over
seas during his college career. After joining the crew of 
a sailboat, Revkin said, I realized I was a storyteller. 
Eventually, when Revkin came to his position at The New 
York Times, he experienced the hardships of writing on 
science and environment in a journalism setting. In his 
book, Revkin details how the nature of science itself 
hinders environmental journalists. Science, and hence 
the environment, is fraught with issues that are not fa
miliar to the American public, said Revkin. In contrast 
to business or sports sections, science sections do not al
ways highlight things people have a basic understanding 
of. Even more importantly, Revkin commented on the 
depletion of science sections in newspapers across the 
country to make way for sections on other topics that will 
be more widely read. Revkin also pointed out that sci
ence faces a major barrier when it enters into journalism
 newspaper editors themselves may have little under
standing of the nuances in science. Revkin mentioned a 
study showing that only 51 percent of managing editors 
of newspapers strongly disagreed with a statement that 
dinosaurs and humans lived contemporaneously. He also 
joked that perhaps the wording of the question, which 
used the word contemporaneously, was too difficult for 
the editors to decipher. Those editors may have limited 
knowledge of science matters, but they are not the main, 
sweeping problem with journalisms relationship with 
the environment. Revkin said that part of what effects the 
coverage of things like global warming is that journalism 
depends on current events. Global warming, he noted, is
Lizza McGregor/Art Editor
a trend that will take place over 100 years, so it is unlikely 
to get coverage unless new findings are presented, and 
even then editors may not be sympathetic to the needs 
of whoever writes the story. Problems that were visible 
environmental issues in the past, Revkin noted, are now 
eliminated; issues more current can be below the surface 
and not receive as much coverage. Revkin also spoke 
about the problem of dealing with experts as sources, 
because at present there is generally an expert on either 
side of an issue. There is a great danger of any story on 
the environments quickly becoming a battle of experts in 
a he said, she said style.
A final hindrance in environmental writing is the space 
constraint. Every story, save a feature or investigative 
one, will be unlikely to be longer than a few columns in a 
newspaper, especially in The New York Times. Revkin de
tailed the differences between working for a mainstream 
newspaper like the Times and working for The Science 
Times, a publication devoted entirely to scientific news. In 
a regular newspaper the space constraint can be worse for 
a science or environmental journalist than for a journal
ist who reports on other subjects. Revkin believes there is 
more need for explanation in a science article, but often 
these stories are afforded the least amount of space.
During a wrap-up question and answer session, Revkin 
was asked to address his stance on advocacy groups. He 
had mentioned during the talk that sources belonging to 
advocacy groups are often seen as unreliable. Two audi
ence members asked him about this position, which he 
clarified by saying that sometimes having a history of a 
stance on an issue does not discredit the findings a group 
may have on an issue, but that the groups background 
must be provided. Journalists will run into trouble if they 
fail to inform readers of the possibility of bias. He also 
addressed the issue of alarmism, which he said was more 
present in the European journalist community; and he 
addressed his disappointment at the lack of talk about 
the environment during the Presidential debates.
Revkins speech gave insight into the problems facing 
journalists who wish to report on the environment or 
scientific discoveries. His warnings about taking an easy 
road to journalism by failing to interpret the facts are 
also crucial advice to the journalism community at large. 
Through his books and his articles Revkin continues to 
bring issues as large as global warming or as obscure 
as salmon polychlorinated biphenyls levels to the fore
ground of the news. His advice provides a basis for devel
oping a better relationship between the environment and 
the journalistic community.

In the last year, Facebook (www.thefacebook.com) has 
become a new and prominent means of online commu
nication among college students. Advocates of Facebook 
spend hours browsing through peoples profiles, inviting 
friends and acquaintances to join their network of online 
friends, and telling non-members to sign up as soon as 
possible. Those who have chosen not to join Facebook of
ten wonder what the point of the website is; its message 
board feature is relatively unimportant, and one might 
expect to know most of ones friends relationship sta
tuses and interests without having to refer to an online 
profile. For both fans of Facebook and those who have not 
warmed up to it, CampusNetwork presents a welcome al
ternative in the world of online communities.
Started in the School of Engineering at Columbia Univer
sity in August 2003, CampusNetwork, originally called 
CUCommunity.com, expanded to other Ivy League schools 
a month ago and a small number of select colleges, in
cluding Carnegie Mellon, two weeks ago. In addition to 
allowing users to create profiles and connect with their 
friends, CampusNetwork also includes radio stations and 
photo galleries, as well as opportunities to create discus
sion forums and online journals.
CampusNetwork originated on Columbia Universitys 
campus out of a need to create a sense of community 
in the student body. At a university located in the heart 
of New York City, life within the campus is often not as 
vibrant as many students want it to be. Engineering stu
dents soon found the website to be an effective way to 
branch out to other Columbia students with similar in
terests. This January, CampusNetwork expanded to the 
rest of Columbia University, and currently about 75 per
cent of the student population are members. In a short 
period of time, the service has become a town hall for 
the university, said Wayne Ting, a junior political sci
ence major who is currently in charge of CampusNetwork 
at Columbia College. Giving students a chance to create 
discussion on many current issues, CampusNetwork is 
a forum for idea exchange, Ting explained. Students of 
different interest groups have begun representing them
selves on CampusNetwork, with the goal of getting their 
voices heard. Especially in light of the presidential elec
tion, students have had the opportunity to bring their 
political opinions onto the site. CampusNetworks status 
as a medium for discussion is so visible on campus that it 
was featured in the New York Sun this year.
In addition to maintaining highly popular discussion 
boards, CampusNetwork also has proved to be simply an 
effective way for users to meet people. Ive met so many 
kids I never would have through CampusNetwork, and it 
isnt as skewy as you would think, because everyone [us
ing the service] is on campus and you could always ask 
one of your friends about that person, said Anna Liveris, 
a sophomore materials science and engineering major at 
Columbia.
Eva Colen, a junior double-majoring in classics and wom
ens and gender studies at Columbia, admitted to using 
CampusNetwork.primarily for procrastination. Colen 
added, I would say that most Columbia students, or at 
least the ones I know, do use [the site].
Even though CampusNetwork and Facebook seem like 
interchangeable services that might be directly in com
petition with one another in a college community, many 
users of CampusNetwork are members of Facebook as 
well. Ting and Colen use Facebook, but pointed out that 
the two services are very different. A lot of people at 
Columbia use thefacebook.com, as well, said Colen. On 
Facebook, however, there is no community whatsoever, 
its more like a classifieds section. You can build relation
ships and express your personality on CampusNetwork, 
whereas thefacebook.com only allows you to add friends 
or stalk crushes. Most Carnegie Mellon students, many 
of whom are active users of Facebook, have not yet beLizza McGregor/Art Editor
come familiar with CampusNetwork.
Ruben Valas, a senior computer science major who uses 
Facebook to find people with common interests, was cu
rious about the radio station feature of CampusNetwork, 
wondering if the stations differed from other free stations 
available online. The Internet is already saturated with 
enough free radio, he said. However, Valas said that the 
option to create photo galleries and online journals on 
Campusnetwork made more sense because of their more 
personal quality.
You can build relationships 
and express your personality on 
CampusNetwork, whereas thefacebook.com only allows you to 
add friends or stalk crushes.
 Eva Colen
Because of CampusNetworks very recent expansion be
yond the Columbia community, those in charge of the site 
do not have any immediate plans to bring the service to 
more colleges. [We are] currently in a sit-and-wait pe
riod, to see how our original users respond to [the expan
sion], said Ting. Longer-term users of CampusNetwork 
are not yet certain if the sense of community the service 
originally created can be maintained with a large-scale 
expansion.

Comedic poetry
Emotionally charged poet delivers his works through comedy
Sitting with his legs crossed on an elegant leather chair, 
Louis Simpson smiled as his close friend Samuel Hazo 
introduced him to the modest audience at the Carnegie 
Lecture Hall on October 6. It was Act I of The Interna
tional Poetry Forum for the 2004-2005 season.
Simpson, born in Jamaica but of Russian and Scottish 
descent, first studied poetry in New York City. During his 
poetry career, he fought in a world war, lived in France, 
and taught at Berkeley and Stony Brook University. His 
poems reflected these experiences.
Simpsons first poem expressed a contradiction in Eng
lish to French translation. How are the news? he de
clared, mocking the plurality of the word news in French. 
His acerbic style continued throughout the whole night. 
He mocked himself, his writing, and poetry in general. 
While introducing a poem, he informed his audience that 
it was the one the critics called the cats meow. He then 
paused with a confused look upon his face and wondered 
aloud whether that was a complimentary phrase.
His mockeries were so extensive and came in such rapid 
succession that he took a breather between two poems. 
He stared intently at the crowd and said very calmly, I 
have been accused of being an ironic poet. He then pro
ceeded to read his poem for the academics to show, as 
he stated so bluntly, that Im not heartless.
Simpson has gained fame also as a literary critic. His most 
famous critique, Three on the Tower, explores the works 
of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and William Carlos Williams. 
He has written four additional books of criticism and 17 
compilations of published poetry.
With references to Gershwin, Disney, Ishi, Chekhov, 
Goya, Blake, Sophocles, Dante, and Shakespeare, Simp
son really showed the range of his knowledge of writing. 
He is an academic, but he is also a jokester, and his ability 
to entertain the audience, while at the same time awing 
them with his work, makes him a distinct performer.
Simpson read a poem titled Hangers to bring pop cul
ture to his mix. In this work, the point of view is from 
Joan Cfawfords wire hangers. Poor Mommy Dearest 
did not like her wire hangers very much at all. Seeing an 
81-year-old man pretending to be a petrified wire hanger 
is worth the price of admission alone.
[n fact, the entire scene was breathtaking. The Carnegie 
Lecture Hall was covered in crimson felt and golden trim, 
[ts steep, staggered seating creates an oval shaped atrium 
)f faultless acoustic construction. It was a perfect room 
or someone as interesting as Simpson to fill with words. 
Towards the nights close, he jokingly told the audience
that he would not bore us and that one should know 
when his time is up. Looking casually at his watch, he 
then concluded quickly, Im not there. He augmented 
this with an anecdote about how he always looks for the 
seat in the room with the easiest escape path, just in case. 
The crowd responded to him with laughter and furious 
applause after each reading. Despite his shameless hu
mor, Simpsons sweet personality showed through.
If Simpsons performance was any indication, The In
ternational Poetry forum will have an incredibly strong 
2004-2005 season. November 17 showcases Robert Gibb 
and Julie Suk in a special joint reading. Additional shows 
are planned through the spring.
The most amazing aspect of Simpsons performance was 
that he was filling in for Peter Davison, who fell ill just 
a day before the show. As Hazo professed in his closing 
statement following the performance, no one was really 
expecting such a powerful and engaging poetry reading. 
Simpson sat back in his chair with a sly smile on his face 
and his book of poetry placed firmly in his lap.

Art for political and social movement
Photos, music, and graphic design: Media for change
Courtesy of of Partisanproject.org
Films such as Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11 and Errol 
Morris The Fog of War are obvious documentaries with 
strong political messages. The audience knows these films 
are going to be politically outspoken furthering the cre
ators opinions. Film has been largely used as a powerful 
medium of art to declare political agendas. But do other 
mediums of art instill such an expectation? When people 
hear the word art they generally think still-life portraits 
and landscapes. But the category contemporary art has 
instilled a deeper understanding of self-expression and 
messages transferred through different mediums. Can art 
be further defined as a form of political expression?
Art has been deeply connected with politics throughout 
history. Picasso painted Guernica in protest of war while 
John Heartfields photo-reports of Hitler during World 
War II protested against the dictators regime. Artists all 
over the world have spoken through their brushes, cam
eras, and designs about their opinion on the state of their 
nation.
A great example of thought-provoking works is shown 
through Pittsburghs very own Andy Warhol. The
J.T. Trollman/Photo Editor
Bon Jovi rocks out during the Kerry rally on October 20.
Warhol Museum on the North Shore has provided many 
political images to incite the viewers feelings about peo
ple in power and world events. Warhol incorporates many 
political images in his works.
Currendy exhibited at the Warhol is the controversial ex
hibit Inconvenient Evidence: Iraqi Prison Photographs 
from Abu Ghraib. Photographs were published on the 
Internet for the public in April of this year and shocked 
the nation. However they were quickly forgotten and 
the people of the United States went on with their lives, 
keeping in mind that soldiers have to do certain things 
in times of war. The curators of the International Center 
for Photography (ICP) in New York and the Andy Warhol 
Museum had a different idea. These two museums cur
rendy display the photographs, printed from their on
line sources simply push-pinned to the museums walls. 
The exhibits invite viewers to leave feedback via e-mail 
or a guestbook left next to the photographs. According 
to Brian Wells, the chief curator of the ICP, The goal of 
this exhibition is to elicit further discussion about what
these pictures mean, to address not only what the pho
tographs depict but also what they say about how we use 
images to understand and shape our world. The pho
tographs come with a warning that the images may be 
too explicit for some viewers. However, this fact alone 
intrigues viewers to take a closer look at what is going on 
in a country that they may only hear of once in a while 
through filtered news. First-hand viewing and uncap
tioned pictures allows viewers tn formulate an unbiased 
and clearer opinion for themselves. Wells explains, The 
pictures themselves are transgressions of specific cultural 
prohibitions against nudity and homosexuality. In light 
of this alleged military strategy, the Abu Ghraib pictures 
pose troubling questions about how photographs can be 
used as propaganda to assert cultural dominance locally 
and as triumphant trophies of war that serve to reinforce 
racial and political hierarchies globally. In this way, pho
tography can be political art.
Photographs of protesters are displayed in an exhibit 
in the office of State Representative Jake Wheadey Jr.,

REGIME CHANG I!
Courtesy of Partisanproject.org
In New York, a similar 
project called the No RNC 
Poster Project was executed 
during the 2004 Republican 
National Convention held 
in Manhattan. According to 
their website, the main goal 
of this project was to show 
the world that New York is 
against Bush, the Republi
cans, and the RNCs callous 
exploitation of the memory 
of September 11 for politi
cal gain, according to their 
website.
Many other projects created 
by independent and groups 
of artists are displayed at 
the Center for the Study of 
Political Graphics (CSPG) 
in Los Angeles. The CSPG

largest collection of politdJanet Park/Pillbox Editor

cal art in the nation. Like all art, political posters stir emotions and reflection. They 
can deepen compassion and commitment, ignite outrage, elicit laughter, and provoke 
action. CSPG stresses the importance and danger of artists getting their voices heard 
about social change, and seeks to preserve the poster art form for future generations.
The art forms mentioned above are less obvious methods of displaying politically 
charged messages. As more people realize that there are many different types of media 
being used to sway the general public, people can hear more artists voices that are not 
heard through film. Information travels in a variety of ways. Art is a powerful tool that 
can be used to transmit messages to the masses. Its up to the individuals to open their 
eyes and catch the things being said.

more commonly known as The Peoples Office, on Centre Avenue in Bloomfield. This 
smaller exhibit was welcomed and introduced by the representative in order to encour
age citizens to vote in the upcoming election. The exhibit features local artists works 
based on themes of social justice, which includes photographs titled Taking the Street, 
taken by Oakland resident Karen Waggoner that focus on a variety of protesters from 
Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. Also on display are several works by children from the 
19th Legislative District, which Wheatley represents.
Last week, students, faculty and local Pittsburghers were able to experience firsthand 
how music could become political expression. Bon Jovis pairing with Kerry a coinci
dence? I think not. Music moves people in unique ways subjective to the observer. Put a 
little spin on the expression and you have a powerful tool to move people in the direction 
you want them to move. Bon Jovi wants to influence his audience to vote for Kerry by 
appealing to their love of his tunes and lyrics. Punk bands such as Anti-Flag and Green 
Day are fervently touring the nation with blatant anti-Bush themes. They are spreading 
their own opinion on our current leader of our nation by appealing to a target audience 
of young people attracted to fast-pounding drums, loud guitars, and moshing.
The Partisan Project, based in Pittsburgh, used art to further their agenda. Designers 
from Pittsburgh, New York, Seattle, and even Vancouver donated their talents to each 
design a poster representing their thoughts on the current leader of our nation. An essay 
was printed on the back of the packet of 15 two-color posters and distributed around 
Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania. These iconic designs are simple expressions 
that convey a thousand words each. This project is pure communication design in action.
They state in their website, 
The only profit will be wit
nessing the power of art 
and design helping to bring 
about significant change.

The Myth of the Guitar Hero
Musical chops do not always make for great music
The guitar is without a doubt the defining instrument of 
rock and roll, and perhaps of American popular music 
in general. Part of its allure is that basically anyone with 
a guitar and a good idea or two can hit it big, if just for 
the proverbial 15 minutes. More enticing is that those 
who have scaled the great heights of guitar-playing
 Hendrix, Vaughn, Page, and Van Halen  all sit com
fortably in rocks pantheon of greats, held up as mythi
cal, almost godlike figures among their fans. Way back 
when, Eric Claptons playing inspired blues enthusiasts 
across England to scrawl Clapton is God in graffiti. And 
even now, you still cant read two pages in Rolling Stone 
without some rocker or critic saying how great Hendrixs 
axworkwas.
Well, youll get no such gushing out of this article. A lot 
of the rock guitar playing regarded by many as the best 
ever is incredibly overrated, and it is high time that music 
fans figure this out.
Let me first of all say that I realize how difficult it is to 
play guitar. My roommate has a Fender, and despite my 
considerable efforts flailing away at it, the only way I can 
compete with the artists whose tracks I play along with 
is that I can always turn my amp up significantly louder 
than theirs. Having admitted that six-string artistry is 
tough, let me then say that there are a lot of people who 
can play the guitar really, really well. A lot. There must be 
hundreds of rock bands at this moment whose guitarists 
could reasonably be considered to be excellent, and it 
has always struck me as odd that a select few are consis
tently rated to be head and shoulders above the rest. I 
mean, this isnt like sports, where there are statistics and 
head-to-head match-ups to settle issues of superiority. In 
rock, there are bound to be some irresolvable differences 
in opinion as to whos the best. In my-mind, this is simply 
a result of there simply not being that much of a differ
ence in talent once you reach a certain level. Perhaps, in 
this particular set of skills, there is no true elite.
You dont buy this argument? Okay, then, the real reason 
Im trying to take the fast-fingered heroes of rock down 
a notch is that, for all of their skill on the strings, their 
songs frequently just dont stack up. An artist can play the 
most dazzling, technically perfect music, win a gold-plated guitar in a competition with the devil, etc., but if he 
and his group arent writing interesting songs or at least 
creating new, intriguing sounds, its all just a big waste of 
my time. As with all of my articles, I could again choose 
to make fun of jam bands the whole time by continuing 
this thread, but suffice it to say that I simply have no idea 
why anyone would subject themselves to the ramblings 
of Jam Nations heroes, other than that their concerts
must certainly outshine their recordings.
Getting back to more conventional album- and songoriented rock, we come to the part of this column from 
which Im expecting the most angry mail, assuming I 
have fans. Ready? Jimi Hendrix is way overrated. Now 
Im not saying his guitar skills are overrated, nor do I 
really have the musical credentials to say so. He seems 
to hit the right notes all the time, and there seem to be 
a lot of them. And Im not saying that he doesnt have 
some good tunes. Still, compared to his contemporaries,
I dont think his recorded output justifies all the T-shirts 
he appears on. He has maybe two classic albums: Electric 
Ladyland and Are You Experienced?, and even those arent 
the cream of the 60s crop. Hes good, but lets please hop 
off the bandwagon, all right? Even more worrying to me 
is the adulation surrounding Eric Claptons thoroughly 
mediocre oeuvre or, heaven forbid, Stevie Ray Vaughns 
endlessly inane blues workouts. Even Robert Johnsons 
King of the Delta Blues still garners enormous respect 
to this day, despite being responsible for perhaps the 
most boring body of work youre bound to encounter. 
Dont believe the hype.
It is not my intention to suggest that guitar heroics and
Courtesy of www.ericclapton.com
great songwriting cant go hand in hand. Im just saying 
that they frequently dont, and Im not willing to overlook 
that. In the liner notes to the Led Zeppelin boxed set, 
critic Robert Palmer illustrates the difference between 
a guitarist who merely plays well and one who makes 
great music, by comparing the post-Yardbirds careers of 
Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck. He notes that in the Jeff Beck 
group Beck puts his own name first and seems to have 
conceived the group primarily as a vehicle for his own 
playing, while in Pages Led Zeppelin the song was 
most important. Theres a reason why you have a giant 
Led Zeppelin poster in your room and not a Jeff Beck one, 
and its not any significant difference in sheer talent. Its 
the songs that matter in rock and roll  the rest is just 
icing on the cake.

CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Someday, you too may be famous enough to 
be paid for doing tire, gasoline, beer, and energy drink advertisements on 
Japanese television, just like your favorite Hollywood stars.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): While scientists may say that being weightless in 
outer space is the closest feeling to being in the womb, you will know better. 
After all, they havent fallen into an industrial-size vat of warm chocolate 
pudding, have they?
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): All the Midwestern girls from your dorm 
will crack up at how New York you are when you mistake whatever makes 
up the field at Gesling Stadium for actual grass.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): After an embarrassing talk with your 
Interpretation and Argument professor, you will finally realize that just 
because someone smiles at you and answers your questions doesnt mean 
theyre hitting on you.
Scorpio (October 24 - November 21): Your animals can talk; they just think 
you arent swift or sophisticated enough to learn their language. Plus, they 
enjoy being able to have secret conversations in front of you at the dinner 
table, just like your parents, who never taught you to speak Mandarin.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22-December 21): After yet another disappointing 
chat with that Icelandic guy from your online dating service, you will finally 
decide that looking for love in a computer cluster on Friday nights may not 
be the best approach.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Obsessing over her in class like 
this will not get you anywhere. Take some initiative! Ask her what her name 
is.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): The next time I catch you outside 
my sisters window with your video camera and night vision lens attachment, 
Im calling the cops. Or Ill call my weightlifting buddies, or buy a German 
shepherd, or something... But you can bet it will be unpleasant and 
intimidating. Now thats a future you can count on.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Avoid large crowds. You are not Eva 
Peron and the proletariat is not there to cheer you on.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Fernando watched in silent celebration as Rogelio chewed and 
swallowed the poisoned entree. He watched Rogelios face closely, 
trying to detect any changes in his mien. Alas, not a twitch or 
furrow crossed his brow. Fernando realized he had been holding 
his breath in anticipation, and he slowly let it out. He was utterly confused. Shouldnt 
Rogelio be clutching his stomach in pain by now? There was only one explanation: The 
ingredients Fernando thought were poisoned must have been benign. But he had been 
so sure! This was a major blow to Fernandos pride. He went over and over in his mind 
the collection of the poisoned bread crumbs, the preparation of the meal, every detail of 
the evening. How could Rogelio not be poisoned? Processing these thoughts, Fernando 
realized he had been pushing the food around on his plate and ignoring his guests. 
He looked up at a small cry from Maria. Oh! she exclaimed. This foie gras really is 
delicious! Fernando looked up in time to see Maria scoop the last bit of the dish into 
her delicate little mouth.

Doom Patrol: Crawling Back Into the Wreckage
Here, emblazoned in the living ink of this newspaper page, lies the 
tragic story of how a bad mainstream comic can become an artistic 
cult classic, and then die trying to return to the mainstream.
In 1963, My Greatest Adventure #80 contained the first appearance 
of DCs lesser-known team, the Doom Patrol. From its rejectmutant tone to its fatherly, wheelchair-bound leader, the comic 
was a blatant response to Marvels creation of the X-Men. The first 
run lasted forty issues before its pathetic unpopularity forced DC 
to trash the title altogether, and issue 41 featured the chief villain, 
Immortus, literally blowing the team to smithereens on a beach.
Skip ahead to the 80s. X-Men has become the most popular comic 
of all time, following Chris Claremonts infamous run as writer, 
which introduced such characters as Wolverine and Dark Phoenix. 
The editors at DC found themselves one step behind the action 
once again, and in a haphazard frenzy brought Doom Patrol back 
to life. History repeated. Eighteen issues came and went, and sales 
remained dismal. Instead of sending it back to the grave again, 
however, DC decided to hand the failing title over to their new 
writer Grant Morrison. Originally from Ireland, Morrison had 
written for the British monthly comic magazine 2000 AD, which, 
my readers, you might recognize from its most famous character, 
Judge Dredd. DC wanted to see what new ideas Morrison could 
bring to the table, and Doom Patrol seemed like a safe place to test 
him out.
Good move for DC! His first story, "Crawling from the Wreckage, 
was very tongue-in-cheek, figuratively telling how terribly Doom 
Patrol had fared as a mainstream comic, because of its low 
readership and horrible writing. From there, Morrison built a 
completely new Doom Patrol that saw over four years of consistent 
success. The story became built on the ideas of absurdity, irony, 
art, and nonsense.
A few characters from the original story remained, but in strange, 
perverted, and ironic ways. Niles Caulder, the Charles Xavier 
wannabe, became a veritable deadbeat dad to the team, ignoring 
them for all intents and purposes except when sending them on 
dangerous, certain-death missions. Cliff Steele, the Robotic Man, 
ceased to be the naive yet brave robot with a human brain and a 
heart of gold, and became an emotionally dependent and unstable 
robot with an addiction to violence. Negative Man, whose soul 
could depart from his body for 60 seconds at a time in the form of 
negative energy, became a hermaphrodite with numerous extra 
scientific, mystic, and psychological senses that disabled his ability 
to relate to humanity.
Morrisons new characters better reflected his whimsical, 
capricious sensibility. Crazy Jane, for example, had over a hundred 
multiple personalities, each with its own super-power, owing to 
sexual abuse when she was a child. Danny the Street is not a super
human, but instead a sentient super-street who can appear in any 
city, unnoticed, overnight. Mr. Nobody, the new primary villain, 
was created in an experiment that stripped him of a limited human
form, leaving his mind and body as free objects that can change 
without limits. Nobody forms an oppositional force to the Doom 
Patrol  which he sees as attempting to enforce rationality on 
an inherently (and beautifully) irrational world  called the 
Brotherhood of Dada.
The absurd stories Morrison wrote for his version of Doom Patrol 
all pit our heroes against irrational problems, which they always 
strive in vain to solve using violence like regular superheroes. 
The Painting That Ate Paris, a story that was recently collected 
in graphic-novel form, involves a special painting (a recursive 
painting, like two mirrors reflecting each other), that is so 
entrancing that viewers become trapped within it, which ends up 
eating the city of Paris and the Doom Patrol itself. Different areas 
of the painting came from different artistic eras, which played 
fun roles in the story. Why The Pentagon is Shaped Like That 
involved a telephone demon that was summoned when Bell made 
the very first telephone call, Watson come here, I need you, not 
knowing that it was a satanic litany. The creature needed to be 
stopped for trying to make language static instead of dynamic. Mr. 
Nobody even ran for president in The Love Bus, a bus powered 
by the bicycle on which the inventor of LSD first experienced an 
acid trip.
The stories operate largely on a nonsensical use of language in 
dialog and mismatched symbols, all reminiscent of Lewis Carroll. 
The function of language as-a mechanism for objectifying and an 
infinitely complex universe into discrete objects is also analyzed 
through surreal images that question divisions of space within the 
panels of a page.
Needless to say, the comic was pretty heady and cool, like a sixtyissue philosophical drug trip. Rachael Pollack picked up the title 
after Morrison left, and when she left they stopped printing the 
series. That was in 1993, when we were all probably in middle 
school.
Back in 2001, they started Doom Patrol v3. The newest issue 
came out today; its titled Blue Steele! because theyre making 
Cliff blue, I suspect. I dont know, I didnt bother buying it. That 
underscores the point Im about to make.
It sucfcs.
Some genius editor at DC decided it needed a chance at a comeback, 
and picked up a couple of guys from a comic convention in Hong 
Kong to do it. They ignored its artistic origins, and just made it 
back into some kind of bland mecha-manga starring Cliff. Please 
help me send DC a message: Buy the reprints of the old issues and 
totally ignore the new stuff. As Mr. Nobody would say, Power to 
the Peephole!
