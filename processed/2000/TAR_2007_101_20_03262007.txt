Grants will fund new 
projects in neuroscience
by Brian Burdulia
Junior Staffwriter
The Center for the Neural 
Basis of Cognition (CNBC), a 
partnership between Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh, has received three 
grants from the National Insti
tute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and 
the National Scierice Foundation 
(NSF) totaling over $7 million, 
according to a March 12 univer
sity press release.
The three new grants the 
CNBC has received will enable 
our students to have a wide range 
of cross-training experiences, 
said Peter Strick, codirector of 
the CNBC and a professor of 
neurobiology and psychiatry 
at the University of Pittsburgh. 
As a consequence, each stu
dent in the center will be able 
to participate in the synthesis of 
disciplines which is the essence 
of modern neuroscience.
Beginning this summer, in an 
effort to expose students from 
other institutions to the CNBC, 
approximately 10 students from 
schools other than Carnegie 
Mellon or the University of Pitts
burgh will be able to enroll in a 
10-week course that will pre
pare them for future research 
projects in computational neu
roscience.
The grants will also fund un
dergraduate research projects 
in computational neuroscience 
conducted through the CNBC.
NIDA donated $2 million to 
the CNBC for the development 
of a new multimodal neuroim
aging training program. The 
program will be headed by Wil
liam Eddy, professor of statistics 
at Carnegie Mellon, and SeongGi Kim, professor of radiology 
and neurobiology at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. New advances 
in in vivo imaging are allowing 
doctors to better understand 
the inner workings of the living
brain at the molecular, cellular, 
and system levels. Students at 
the CNBC will be researching 
these levels using these newly 
available advanced . imaging 
techniques.
NIDA donated an additional 
$2 million to the center to fund 
training for computational neu
roscientists using the Blueprint 
for Neuroscience. The Blueprint 
is a curriculum developed by 
the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) with the intention of ad
vancing research methods in 
order to expedite discoveries in 
the field of neuroscience.
Students enrolled in the 10- 
week summer program will be 
working with the Blueprint at 
the CNBC with Robert Kass, a 
professor of statistics at Carnegie 
Mellon, and G. Bard Ermentrout, 
a professor of mathematics at the 
University of Pittsburgh. The stu
dents will take classes in various 
aspects of neuroscience research 
methods, then choose an inde
pendent research project to con
duct at the CNBC for the remain
der of the 10-week period.
The program provides Carn
egie Mellon, which does not 
currently have pre-professional 
programs, with a pre-doctoral 
training program. It also es
tablishes a six-week summer 
program for senior graduate 
students, medical students, post
doctorate fellows, and scientists 
interested in neuroimaging. The 
program aims to bolster coop
erative efforts among 15 other 
NIH institutes working to better 
understand the nervous system.
Students with strong 
backgrounds in biology and 
psychology are being asked to 
train in computational meth
ods, said Strick. The result is 
a new generation of multidis
ciplinary neuroscientists who 
are comfortable asking complex 
questions and then using the

Student gets fellowship to research black culture
by Amanda Cole
Junior Staffwriter
Katherine Chilton, a student in 
Carnegie Mellons Ph.D. program 
in history, was awarded a re
search fellowship from the Gilder 
Lehrman Institute of American 
History earlier this month. The 
fellowship will help to further 
Chiltons research for her disser
tation, titled Gender, Labor, and 
Family during Slavery and the 
Transition to Freedom in the Dis
trict of Columbia 1820-1875.
This July, Chilton will spend 
two weeks in New York City in 
order to conduct research at the 
New York-based Schomberg Cen
ter for Research in Black Culture. 
The fellowship will help offset 
travel and lodging expenses, 
making the trip possible.
Im really excited about this 
trip, she said. [The Schomberg 
Center] has Southern church re
cords, which arent usually seen 
because most churches keep them 
locked up in their basements.
The Gilder Lehrman Institute 
for American History, founded in 
1994, is a nonprofit organization 
devoted to the study of history. 
The institute awards fellowships 
and teaching awards to history 
scholars and instructors. It has 
also helped to establish stronger 
history programs within schools 
and has produced print and elecironic publications for those in 
the history field.
This year, Chilton was one of 24 
applicants who received a fellow
ship. The organization received 
56 applications from students 
around the world.
Chiltons research focuses on 
the urban African-American ex
perience in the 19th century in 
Washington, D.C. Her main focus 
is on labor and family, particu
larly the living conditions of slave 
families and the kinds of work 
they did.
Most people dont think of the 
District of Columbia as a southern 
city, but blacks from places like 
Maryland and Virginia moved 
there, and I think its interesting 
because this was where all the 
policymakers were, but there 
were no new jobs for blacks, 
she said. What does freedom re
ally mean if youre still doing the 
same work? Thats what I want to 
find out.
While at the Schomberg Cen
ter, Chilton plans to look at 
documents such as church re
cords and travel narratives. As 
most of the documents she has 
had available to her thus far, 
mostly censuses and other gov
ernment records, are what she 
called dry and dusty, she hopes 
that these documents will add 
some color to her dissertation.
Lots of northerners traveled 
to D.C., and they wrote about

what they saw and about the 
slaves working there, she said. 
In church records, you can see 
what people thought was impor
tant and what the communities 
were raising money for.
Tera Hunter, Chiltons advisor 
and an associate professor in the 
history department, is equally
enthused about the project.
Her project promises to break 
new ground, Hunter said. By 
looking at this broader time pe
riod, she continued, Chilton will 
be able to discern broader pat
terns that other historians have

Carnegie Mellon alum makes Jeopardy! history
by Rachita Chandra
Junior Staffwriter
Answer: Carnegie Mellon
alumnus and creator of Jeopardy! 
history. Question: Who is Scott 
Weiss?
In the final round of his lastgame, Weissj a contestant on 
three games of the popular tele
vision game show Jeopardy!, the 
last of which aired on March 16, 
bet such that he and the other 
two contestants would tie for 
first place, something that has 
never occurred in the history of 
the shows 43 years.
All three concluded the show 
with $16,000 in prize money. In 
addition, they were required to 
play a fourth game that would 
serve as a tie-breaker.
Weiss surpassed his closest 
opponents score by more than
double on the show that aired on 
Wednesday (March 14) and had 
an easy win on his second day 
(March 15), before making it to 
the historic show that aired on 
Monday.
In the final round of his final 
game, Weiss could either bet 
$2601, with which, assuming 
that he answered the question 
correctly, he would defeat the 
other two players outright, or al
ternatively wager just enough to 
force a three-way-tie with his op
ponents. This would result in all 
three contestants playing each 
other again in a fourth game.
He decided to do the latter. 
The show contacted a mathema
tician, who put the chance of 
such a three-way tie at one in 25 
million. Weiss doesnt regret the 
decision.
I didnt lose anything by let
ting others win, he said.
Weiss is an alum of Carnegie 
Mellons first undergraduate 
computer science class in 1992. 
He currently works as a professor 
of computer science at Mount St. 
Mary in Walkersville, Md.
While at Carnegie Mellon, 
Weiss worked as a teaching assis
tant of. Calculus for Humanities 
Students (now 21-111).
That was my first real teach
ing experience that helped me 
get to the job I have today, he 
said.
Weiss took Jeopardy!s online 
test last March and was subse
quently randomly selected to 
attend a live audition in Wash
ington, D.C.
Following the audition, the' 
show notified him that he would 
compete on the air in November. 
An estimated 400 out of 100,000 
people who make it through the 
online test are selected to be on
the show.
I was overwhelmed to learn 
that I was one of those selected, 
Weiss said.
In December, Weiss first epi
sode was shot in Los Angeles. 
Due to the shows Christmas hia
tus, for three months Weiss was 
not allowed to disclose his vic
tory with anyone except his wife 
and sister, who had come down to 
L.A. with him for the shooting.
Five shows were shot in a day, 
and the final show was shot on 
the last day. It was hard keeping 
from people the fact that I had 
not only won but also created his
tory on Jeopardy!, Weiss said.
This is not Weisss first run-in 
with Jeopardy!. He has been an 
ardent viewer of the show since 
his teens.
While Weiss was an undergrad

H&SS announces 
graduate teaching 
award recipient
Faculty in the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences honored English 
Ph.D. candidate Necia Werner with 
the 2007 H&SS Graduate Student 
Teaching Award, the college an
nounced on March 13. The award 
is presented annually to a graduate 
student who has demonstrated excep
tional scholarship and the ability to 
inspire the undergraduate students he 
or she teaches.
Werner has taught numerous un
dergraduate classes in technical and 
professional writing, an opportunity 
that is only afforded to a few graduate 
students who have proven that they are 
capable of such independent teaching. 
During her tenure at Carnegie Mellon, 
she has taught 76-271: Introduction to 
Professional and Technical Writing, 76- 
270: Writing for the Professions, and 
76-101: Interpretation and Argument.
The college noted Werners ability to 
effectively challenge and inspire stu
dents while maintaining an organized

an asset among her colleagues, her 
department reported, and often shares 
teaching tips and materials with fellow 
Ph.D. students.
In her own research over the past 
several years, Werner has contributed 
to the development of new materi
als on intercultural communication, 
ethics in professional writing, science 
writing, and the effects of visual and 
verbal elements on the way people 
perceive professional and technical 
documents overall.
Werner, a native of Wisconsin, re
ceived a B.S. in English and psychology 
from the University of WisconsinMadison in 1997. She received her 
M.A. in rhetoric from Carnegie Mellon

News Editor
Cletus Anderson, professor 
emeritus in Carnegie Mellons 
School of Drama, died on March
16 at his home in Squirrel Hill. He 
was 69.
The cause was cancer, accord
ing to a March 21 article in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Anderson and his wife, Bar
bara, joined the School of Drama 
faculty in 1968. Since then, An
derson has acted as production 
designer, art director, costume 
designer, and set designer on 
countless film and television 
projects as well as for the Pitts
burgh Public Theater and the 
School of Drama. In 1978, he was 
appointed to head the design and 
production option and remained 
in the position until 1995. He re
tired in 2003.
He is also the coauthor of Cos
tume Design with his wife, the 
second edition of which was pub
lished by Harcourt Brace in 1998. 
Mrs. Anderson is associate dean 
of the College of Fine Arts and a 
Bessie Anathan drama professor.
Anderson was a mentor to stu
dents as well as a connection to 
the world of drama outside Carn
egie Mellon.
Cletus was always very close 
with his students, Mrs. Ander
son said. He would often have 
them out to the house to work on 
projects. They felt he gave them 
guidance in becoming a designer 
but also a way to work and live.
Anderson was also very close 
with his colleagues within the de
partment, according to his wife. 
He was always open and willing 
to discuss projects, and costumed
many faculty members when they 
were in productions themselves. 
In the later years of his tenure, 
many of his colleagues were also 
former students.
One such colleague is. Susan 
Tsu, who took over Andersons 
position as professor of costume 
design upon his retirement. Tsu 
received her BFA in drama from 
the College of Fine Arts in 1972 
and her MFA in 1974.
[Cletus] has inspired and 
launched the careers of success
ful designers and teachers across 
the United States, Tsu said. For 
those of us lucky enough to have 
had Cletus as a teacher, his high 
standards, wisdom, and talent 
will be with us forever.
Barbara could not estimate the 
number of productions in which 
Anderson had been involved 
throughout his career. She did 
mention that one of his most 
difficult undertakings was the 
production of 180 costumes for 
the School of Dramas production 
of Nicholas Nickelby.
Thomas Wesley Douglas, asso
ciate professor of music theatre, 
recalled working with Anderson 
on the Pittsburgh premier of the 
musical Closer than Ever in 1994.
Cletus was a wonderful singer 
and actor, Douglas said. We had 
a ball.
Andersons students carry 
equally fond memories.
Professor Cletus Anderson 
was an extraordinary mentor 
for me and many others, said 
Su Pei-chi, who graduated from 
Carnegie Mellon in 2001 with an 
MFA in costume design.
In 1999,1 faced the first design 
challenge to put on a main-stage 
production for School of Drama. 
There was a lot of pressure; hence 
we worked restlessly day and 
night, she continued. One day, 
I was in the costume shop star
ing at the shows costume on a 
mannequin with no clue how to 
proceed. Suddenly a voice came 
from the other end of the room 
saying Its not that bad. It was 
one of Cletus humorous com
ments.
Andersons last project was as 
set designer for a production of 
Forbidden Broadway for the Civic 
Light Opera. The show will run at 
the Theater Square Cabaret until 
April 15.
A memorial service at Carnegie 
Mellon will take place in April.
In lieu of flowers, the family 
asks that memorial contributions 
be made to the Anderson Pro
duction Fund, Carnegie Mellon

More than a thousand 
students, professors, and Pitts
burgh residents marched down 
Fifth Avenue into Oakland last 
Saturday to mark the fourth an
niversary of the beginning of 
the war in Iraq. This event was 
one of many in Pittsburgh and 
across the country organized by 
pro- and anti-war activists alike 
to make their voices heard as the 
U.S. began its fifth year of in
volvement in Iraq.
Saturdays march combined 
the forces of political activism 
groups in local colleges, univer
sities, and the community. In 
total, an estimated 1200 people 
attended the rally.
The march began at the 
Islamic Center, passed the Soft
ware Engineering Institute (SEI)
 where protestors spoke out 
against Carnegie Mellons fed
eral government-commissioned 
military technology  and 
ended on Bigelow Boulevard, 
where participants congregated 
on the University of Pittsburgh 
campus.
Participants hoped to convey 
to the public their belief that 
troops should be sent home now. 
Their statement comes on the 
heels of the Iraq Accountability 
Act, passed in the U.S. House of 
Representatives last weekend, 
which set a pullout date of Au
gust 2008.
The demonstration also hoped 
to bring attention to the losses 
created by the continuation of 
the war. As of now, 3200 troops 
have been killed and 23,000 sol
diers have been injured, 1100 of 
whom were Pennsylvanians.
I am very satisfied with how 
the protest went, said John 
Clendaniel, president of Pitt 
Against War (PAW).
University Police said that 
participants were most intent on 
communicating a message in a 
peaceful manner.
We generally get along well 
with protesters, and this was 
one was no exception, said 
Sergeant Richard Sima of Uni
versity Police. The protest went 
completely without incident, 
and [there was] only one arrest 
by the city police at the start of 
the protest.
The rally came on the heels of 
the March 2 protests at Carnegie 
Mellons National Robotics Engi
neering Center (NREC), where 
protesters chained themselves 
to the buildings gates to show 
opposition to the universitys 
role in the development of mili
tary technology.
Organizers were enthusiastic 
about the events three guest 
speakers, the protesters en
ergy, the presence of youth in 
the crowd, and the clarity of the 
anti-war message. It was these 
finishing touches, they felt, that 
made this years march stand 
out.
However, fewer participants 
came out for Saturdays march 
than in previous years.
The decrease is numbers can 
most likely be attributed to the 
bad weather we experienced 
that day, said Jonah McAllister-Erickson, a Thomas Merton 
Center volunteer who helped or
ganize the event.
Despite the decline in num
bers, morale was high among 
participants who chose to 
attend. The majority of Pitts
burghs political activism 
groups, both university-based 
and community-based, were 
represented in the crowd.
Based at the University of 
Pittsburgh, PAW is an anti-war 
campaigning group that orga
nizes speak-outs and rallies 
aimed at spreading the anti-war 
message. PAW collaborates with 
students from Carnegie Mellon, 
Duquesne University, and the 
Art Institute of Pittsburgh.
The focus is really to build a 
broad, mass anti-war movement 
[so that], regardless of who is in 
Congress, there is this large mass 
movement that would make it 
politically infeasible to continue 
the war, Clenandiel said.
Clenandiel is also a volunteer 
for the Thomas Merton Center, 
whose Anti-War Committee

Alum forces three-way deadlock on Jeopardy!
JEOPARDY, from Al
at Carnegie Mellon, a few of his 
friends drove to Cleveland for 
a chance to participate in Jeop
ardy!, but Weiss declined out of 
nervousness. He recalled watch
ing Jeopardy! daily with his 
friends at Carnegie Mellon and 
having mock Jeopardy! games on 
campus.
Ive always watched trivia 
games and been pretty good at 
it, said Weiss, who also enjoys 
solving crossword puzzles and 
playing board games.
One of the techniques Weiss 
used during the show was read
ing the question before seeing its 
video, which allowed him to an
swer more quickly.
Weiss cherishes the memories 
that he had on the sets of Jeop
ardy!, including his interactions 
with host Alex Trebek.
Hes a nice guy. He knows the 
questions and so hes like a se
curity. He talked to us about his 
favorite shows and how he fixed 
plumbing, Weiss said.
Weiss continues to keep in
touch with co-contestants Jamey 
Kirby and Anders Martinson via 
e-mail.
Anders, Jamey, and I bonded 
with each other, Weiss said. It 
was like three buddies playing a 
game together.
Weiss holds no regrets about 
the way that he played..
Having had such a wonderful 
time with them was even more 
gratifying than the actual expe
rience of winning to them in the 
tie breaker would have been, he 
said. I would wager the same 
amount [so as to tie with the 
them] again if I were to play the 
game once more.
Weiss plans on donating a por
tion of his winnings to a reform 
Jewish congregation organiza
tion and to some other charity 
firms. He also plans to save some 
for his 3-year-old sons college ed
ucation, which, he added, might 
be at Carnegie Mellon.
Other than using his Jeop
ardy! buzzer .while watching the 
show on television and playing a 
Simpsons version of the Jeopardy! 
board game at home, Weiss said
he prepared for the show by read
ing entry after entry on Wikipe
dia.
At home, I asked my wife 
questions for fun, he said. I also 
wrote my own questions to enact 
the mindset of the games writ
ers.
On the spot during the actual 
show, he also used knowledge 
gleaned from his sons alphabet 
book to answer a question in the 
shows fish, bird, or mammal 
section, and an answer from a 
crossword puzzle, for which he 
subsequently sent the author a 
thank-you note.
Weiss has fond memories of his 
time on the Jeopardy! set in Los 
Angeles.
Most of it is exactly the same 
as you see on air, Weiss said.
However, he noticed few differ
ences between the taped version 
of Jeopardy! and the episode that 
airs on television.
They edit out tiny things like 
bad audio and Alex Trebeks mis
takes, Weiss said. [Also], the 
audience tends to look upward at 
a monitor above the contestants
rather than at the contestants 
and the scores of the contestants 
are to the left.
Towards the end of the show, 
Weiss had a heartwarming en
counter with a teacher who had 
brought her class to the set.
She came up to me and said, 
Thank you for teaching my kids 
invaluable lessons of sportsman
ship and generosity, he said.
The tie-breaking episode aired 
on March 19.
Though Weiss was in the lead, 
for the majority of the game, he 
lost in the final round and Kirby 
was declared the winner. How
ever, Weiss had won the largest 
sum of money over the four epi
sodes.
Despite his ultimate loss, Weiss 
holds no regrets.
If given a chance, I would go 
back in a heartbeat to play Jeop
ardy! again, Weiss said.
His advice to Carnegie Mellon 
students who want to make it 
onto the show?
Watch Jeopardy! daily and 
dont be afraid to give it a shot, 
he said.

the imminent invasion of Iraq 
in January 2003. Together with 
independent organizations like 
the Pittsburgh Organizing Com

held in Pittsburgh and marches 
in Washington, D.C. The AWC 
was the dominant organizing 
force behind Saturdays event.
Pittsburgh is also home to 
a local chapter of CodePink, 
a nationwide anti-war group 
especially for women activists.
We often work together with 
other womeris organizations in 
Pittsburgh such as the National 
Organization for Women (NOW) 
and the Pitt Womens Group, 
said Tracy Porter, a CodePink 
Pittsburgh leader.
Members of CodePink made 
their statement dressed in pink 
sweats and holding posters that 
declared Women say no to war 
and Women say pull out.
It is wonderful to see that 
four years in, the energy and 
morale of protesters is so high, 
Porter said.
Pittsburgh is also home to Iraq

The event was also attended 
by members of several pro-war 
groups, who wanted the same 
opportunity to have their voices 
heard, including Carnegie

Political activists are grow

who gather in support of Repub
lican ideals, and in particular 
the war in Iraq.
Regardless of the political ten

during the march, Clendaniel 
reported that the event overall 
was a success.
The energy in th crowd was 
great, and there was an over

Lastly, the CNBC received 
about $3 million from the Na

which it will use to renew its In

program.
The program is designed to fa
miliarize graduate students with 
specialty areas in neuroscience 
that are outside of their own ar
eas of concentration. The profes
sors who maintain close contact 
with the IGERT team are David 
Touretzky, research professor 
of computer science at Carnegie 
Mellon, and Carol Colby, profes
sor of neuroscience at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh.
The grants will allow students 
to pursue a variety of fields, 
which is necessary for todays 
generation of students, Strick 
said.
We are now moving into a 
new era of multidisciplinary 
training in which we are ask
ing our students to stretch 
intellectually. Students with a 
mathematics, computer science, 
or engineering background are 
being asked to learn about and 
do biology, he said.
The staff of the CNBC hope 
that the grants will help them 
achieve a better understanding 
of cognitive processes such as 
thinking and learning, memory, 
language, and perception.
These grants recognize 
the excellence of the CNBC 
in cross-disciplinary brain 
research, stated Carl Olsen, pro

missed. This promise of a new 
perspective is one of the reasons 
that Hunter recommended Chil
ton for the fellowship.
Hunter is not the only one who 
thinks that Chiltons research is 
important to the field of history.
One of the main deciding fac
tors in awarding fellowships is 
having a compelling topic on an 
important history subject, said 
Eric Sharfstein, communications 
manager for the Gilder Lehrman 
Institute.
Other factors include the 
dependence upon documents 
located in the historical archives 
in New York City and the appli
cants credentials as a scholar.
One of the five historical 
archives in New York, the Schomberg Center is one of the premier 
archives of African-American 
history, art, and culture accord
ing to its website. The archives 
contain documents on subjects
such as the civil rights movement 
and the culture of slavery.
The other archives in proximity 
to the Schomberg Center are the 
Gilder Lehrman Collection, the 
Library of New York Historical 
Society, the Columbia Univer
sity Rare Book and Manuscript 
Library, and the Humanities and 
Social Sciences Library. Both the 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
Library and the Schomberg Cen
ter are divisions of the New York 
Public Library System.
This fellowship will aid Chil
ton in the research process for 
her dissertation, which has only 
just begun. Her trip will mark the 
start of a long but rewarding pro
cess. Chilton hopes to complete 
the project within two years.
She is hesitant, however, to set 
such a firm goal.
There is so much written 
about American history, and in 
order to find something new, you 
have to dig. Its like mining for

Study looks at health care program
by Christine 
deBriffault
Staffwriter
In partnership with Blue 
Shield of California, the Labora
tory for International Data Privacy 
at Carnegie Mellon University has 
proven that a patient-centered case 
management program for severely 
ill patients results in cost reductions 
of more than $18,000 per patient. 
The patient-centered case man
agement program (PCM) is

Through PCM, these nurses help 
educate the patient on their treat
ment options, health care services, 
and pain management options.
By organizing patient care to 
fit the individual needs of pa
tients, PCM has been proven to help 
patients avoid unnecessary hospitalization 
and emergency departrment visits.
For this study, PCM was provided by 
ParadigmHealth. This study also re
quired that all of the participants 
be complex care patients, or 
patients who have a clini
cally advanced illness 
and the presence of at j
least two diseases.

senior medical 
of Blue Shield of 
fornia, stated, The 
kinds of diseases that 
PCM deals with cannot 
be prevented. Most of the 
patients managed by PCM 
have already received appropri
ately aggressive treatments.
In the study, 756 Blue Shield of Cal
ifornia Health Maintenance Organization 
members were followed for 18 months. 
About half of these candidates received 
PCM; the 16-nurse and two-physician 
team from ParadigmHealth spent an aver
age of 10 hours per patient per month.
All 358 patients in the PCM cohort 
received an initial phone call and were 
contacted, on average, 14 times per month. 
Providers and the health plan (a subscription-based medical care arrangement 
working with Blue Shield) made an aver
age of 10 calls per month. ParadigmHealth 
made about 18,240 phone calls to patients, 
providers, and the 
health plan.
Attheendofl8months, 
the patients who received PCM 
made different treatment choices, 
such as less radiation and chemother
apy among oncology patients. Given 
reported death data in the American 
Journal of Managed Care, the extra che
motherapy and radiation experienced by 
the other half of the cohort did not seem to 
produce any survival benefit.
PCM patients were also more proactive 
with their care plans, which resulted in 
fewer symptoms stemming from impa
tience, such as nausea and anemia.
This decrease in facility-based treat
ment found in hospitals and emergency 
departments and the increased use of out
patient services such as a hospice or home 
care decreased expenses by 26 percent per 
patient.
In the American Journal of Managed 
Care, where this study was first published, 
the article stated that frequent contact en
abled nurses to notice potential lapses in 
care. The researchers used the example of 
a brain cancer patient about to run out of 
his anticonvulsant. The registered nurse 
was able to organize delivery of medica
tion to this patient, thereby preventing 
seizure, possible aspiration, an emergency 
department visit, and hospitalization.
Overall, the study concluded that PCM 
patients resorted to less costly home care 
and hospice care instead of costly hospital 
and emergency room visits.
According to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, Hospital admis
sions were reduced by 38 
percent, hospital days 
were reduced by 36 
percent, emergency 
room visits were re
duced by 30 percent, 
home care was increased by 
22 percent, and hospice use was 
increased by 62 percent.
The Carnegie Mellon press release 
summarized the financial outcome of 
the program. The average combined 
utilization cost of the PCM cohort was 
$49,742 per patient for the 18-month 
study duration. Compared with $68,341 
in the usual case management cohort, this 
amounts to an average savings of about 
$18,599 per patient.
With these results, the first of its kind, 
Blue Shield of California offered PCM to its 
entire member population.

ETC students create video games for Disney theme park
by Michael M. Whiston
Science & Technology Editor
Carnegie Mellons Entertain
ment Technology Center (ETC) 
has teamed up with Walt Disney 
Parks and electronics company 
Siemens this semester to create a 
collection of arcade games called 
Project Spaceship Earth for Dis
neys Epcot Center.
According to the Siemens 
website, this project is part of a 
12-year alliance between Sie
mens and Disney.
Siemens is a technology com
pany devoted to creating a wide 
range of products, including 
communications, transporta
tion, and power technologies. 
Siemens has agreed to sponsor a 
post-show attraction for Space
ship Earth at Disneys Epcot 
Center.
The Entertainment Technol
ogy Centers website stated, The 
games offer a fun and exciting 
look at how Siemens technolo
gies make our lives better.
In particular, this attraction 
will take the form of several exhibits that relate to health care, 
transportation, and energy. It 
will occupy 9000 square feet.
ETC masters student DaeHong 
Kim said that Siemens recruited 
students from the ETC in Sili
con Valley to create web-based 
games designed to teach gam
ers about Siemens. According to 
Kim, the games are intended for 
individuals between the ages of 
10 and 14.
Its more like an educational, 
casual game, DaeHong said: He 
said that gamers are expected 
to play less than half an hour to
get an idea of what Siemens is all 
about.
Masters student Jake Rheinfrank, who works as an artist 
on Project Spaceship Earth, said 
that the biggest perk about work
ing in Silicon Valley is being near 
Electronic Arts.
We can see all of their concept 
art, Rhe'infrank said. We can 
hear Simpsons dialogue down 
the hallway.
Kim said that working on a 
project in Silicon Valley is differ
ent from working on a project in 
Pittsburgh.
First of all, theres a lot of 
companies in Silicon Valley, 
Kim said. Its really easy to net
work with people.
While it is possible to work 
on a long-distance project from 
Pittsburgh, Kim said, Its better 
to talk face-to-face.

How Things Work: Fireworks
Sarah Mogin
Though fireworks are typically asso
ciated with holidays like Independence 
Day and New Years Eve, the science 
behind these ornate explosions can be 
traced back to China.
Indeed, it was people of the East who 
first invented gunpowder, the explosive 
substance still used in fireworks today. 
Records of gunpowder in its earliest 
forms date back to the Han Dynasty (206 
BCE-220 CE).
The Chinese created primitive 
gunpowder in the form of saltpeter 
explosions. Saltpeter (from the Latin 
sal petrae, meaning stone salt) is a 
laymans term for potassium nitrate 
(KN03).
Potassium nitrate was traditionally 
extracted from a compost of manure, 
urine, and either mortar or wood. It can 
also be found in caves as the result of 
several centuries worth of bat dung de
posits. Potassium nitrate has even shown 
up in literature; it lined the catacomb 
walls in Edgar Allen Poes The Cask of 
Amontillado.
In modern times, potassium nitrate 
comes from the sodium nitrate plenti
fully available in the Chilean deserts. 
Once purified, the harvested sodium 
nitrate (NaN03) is combined with 
potassium chloride (KC1) to produce po
tassium nitrate.
In fireworks, potassium nitrate serves 
to oxidize the metals involved in the re
action, such as iron. The interaction is 
called an oxidation/reduction reaction, 
or, more compactly, a redox reaction.
A redox reaction is a chemical process 
involving an oxidant (in this case, potas
sium nitrate) and a reductant (iron). An 
example of a redox reaction is rust.
All redox reactions can be broken up 
into two parts: oxidation and reduction.
In the oxidation half of the reaction, 
a reductant (like iron) loses electrons. 
The converse to this is called reduction, 
when an oxidant (like potassium nitrate) 
gains electrons.
Students often use the mnemonic 
OIL RIG to help keep the two reactions 
straight: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is 
Gain.
Even without potassium nitrate, all 
metals undergo a process of oxidation 
when exposed to the air.
In a large piece of metal, only the 
outermost layer will react with the sur
rounding oxygen; once oxidized, this
Joseph Wang/Art Staff
Fireworks are launched from the earth when an oxidant in gunpowder reacts with a metal.
layer will protect the metal within. A 
good way to visualize this process is to 
think of rust.
However, metals ground into particles 
are small enough that there is no protec
tive layer. Even without gunpowder, a 
handful of metal particles released into 
the air would oxidize with the surround
ing oxygen.
As stated earlier, the metal (the reduc
tant) would lose electrons and give off 
heat. Without the presence of a protec
tive outer layer, the reaction is strong 
enough to give off heat in the form of 
light  and thats when all this talk 
of chemistry becomes relevant to the 
Fourth of July.
Gunpowder speeds up the oxidation 
process. When incited (by heat or colli
sion), gunpowder becomes unstable. At 
this point, potassium nitrate, the oxidant 
in gunpowder, reacts with the metal.
Potassium nitrate, like all nitrates, 
contains oxygen. Thus, its able to do the 
airs job  only faster.
Gunpowder provides the possibility of 
an immediate burst of light; the explo
sion that releases the metal into the air 
is the same explosion that oxidizes it.
Theres no waiting for the metal to react 
with the air.
Potassium nitrate, however, makes 
up only 75 percent of the composition 
of gunpowder. Gunpowder is also ap
proximately 15 percent charcoal and 10 
percent sulfur.
Gunpowder is what is known as a 
low explosive, meaning that it is less 
powerful than high explosives such 
as dynamite.
As a result, gunpowder is an excellent 
propellant, but a rather lousy detonator. 
Gunpowder provides a sufficient amount 
of force to fire a bullet from a gun with
out doing any damage to the gun itself. 
Dynamite, on the other hand, is so strong 
that it would destroy the guns barrel.
Then again, if youre trying to blow 
up a rock, youd be better off with a high 
explosive; gunpowder alone would be 
quite inadequate.
With fireworks, however, gunpowder 
proves to be much more useful. Fire
works are commonly released, using 
gunpowder, out of steel tubes.
When gunpowder is ignited out in the 
open, the result is a rather unexciting 
emission of heat. Launching a firework
requires a full-blown explosion, so the 
gunpowder is trapped in a compartment 
at the base of the tube. Once lit, the 
gunpowder builds up enough energy to 
cause an explosion, which allows for the 
escape of the accumulating heat.
For stability, the tube should be about 
three times longer than the firework it 
contains, though the two objects should 
have nearly the same diameter; the fire
work has to fit tightly within the tube in 
order to prevent a misfire.
In order to ignite gunpowder, a fuse 
is required. Fuses have taken several 
forms over the centuries. Beginning in 
the Renaissance, fuses were gunpowder 
wrapped in tissue paper.
The fuse later evolved into a string 
with gunpowder within. Now, pyrotechnicians use electrical wires as fuses.
Every firework has a main fuse con
nected to two secondary fuses. One 
secondary fuse serves to light the lift 
charge, the charge that propels the fire
work from its steel tube.
The other fuse, which is set to burn 
more slowly, lights a separate container 
of gunpowder at the fireworks center. 
This fuse is on a time-delay so that it will 
cause the gunpowder to ignite when the 
firework is at the highest point of its tra
jectory.
Inside each firework are creations 
called stars (jawbreaker-sized objects 
containing gunpowder), perchlorate 
(used to amplify the sound of the ex
plosion), and materials for binding 
and coloring.
Stars are stored in containers called 
breaks, each of which has an amount 
of gunpowder called a bursting 
charge. This gunpowder is lit by the 
time-delayed fuse.
Like in the lift charge, the gunpowder 
is trapped in a confined space until it 
finally explodes. At this point, the stars 
are released and ignited.
Fireworks that create multicolored ex
plosions contain stars of different colors. 
Various types of metals act as the color
ing agents.
When burning metals produce light, 
theyre actually emitting photons. Met
als emit photons at distinct wavelengths, 
each of which is associated with a differ
ent color.
This is why burning calcium produces 
orange light, while burning sodium 
produces yellow. Pyrotechnicians have 
figured out a metal or combination of 
metals for every color desirable.
SciTechBriefs
Evidence found on 
plate tectonics
Scientists now hypothesize 
that the Earths tectonic plates 
began moving about 3.8 billion 
years ago. This claim diverges 
from the previous finding that 
such movement began 2.5 bil
lion years ago, which was based 
on a rock formation in China.
Scientists base their most 
recent estimate of 3.8 billion 
years on a rock formation in 
Greenland, called the Isua 
supracrustal belt. This rock for
mation is one of several ancient 
formations that survived the 
molten meltdown of the Earths 
early history.
The Isua supracrustal belt has 
cracks with volcanic rock inside. 
This finding suggests that the 
Isua supracrustal belt split bil
lions of years ago and filled with 
magma from the ocean.
Gustaf Arrhenius, who is 
a member of the Scripps In
stitution of Oceanography in 
California, stated, Its a mar
velous case of solving a jigsaw 
puzzle, and a very difficult one 
because these rocks are all very 
old and have been badly man
gled.

Gold used to 
quicken reactions
Researchers have found 
that gold has catalytic proper
ties, meaning that it can speed 
up chemical reactions. Dean 
Toste, an associate professor 
at the University of California, 
Berkeley, has put forth a hy
pothesis to explain this finding 
using Einsteins special theory 
of relativity.
The electrons surrounding a 
gold nucleus move at half the 
speed of light. Consequently, 
by the theory of relativity, the 
electrons become heavy and 
the gold atom becomes more 
condensed.
When this happens, one of 
the atoms electron shells ac
cepts electrons, while another 
shell gives electrons.
Thus, whereas most metal 
catalysts either only accept or 
give electrons, Toste claims 
that gold does both. This dual 
ability of gold enables the metal 
to catalyze reactions involving 
carbon to carbon bonds. These 
chemical bonds are imperative 
to the formation of organic mol
ecules.

Monkeys use rocks 
to communicate
Antonio Moura, a researcher 
of biological anthropology at 
the University of Cambridge, 
has found that Brazilian mon
keys hit stones together as a 
form of communication. The 
monkeys also teach one an
other how to communicate in 
this way.
By hitting stones together, 
monkeys fend off threaten
ing animals. Moura found 
that as he moved closer to the 
monkeys, the monkeys would 
pick up stones and bang them 
against rocks. As the monkeys 
became accustomed to Mouras 
presence, however, they used 
the stones less frequently.
Moura also found that older 
and younger monkeys banged 
stones together without no
ticing him. This suggests that 
the older monkeys teach the 
younger monkeys to use this 
tactic.

as described by Halpert, not 
only provided more synchro
nized, cost-effective care than 
traditional management but 
also satisfied the patients who 
received PCM.
Latanya Sweeney, head of the 
Data Privacy Lab, stated, This 
is great news for those who face 
some of the most expensive 
complex health care needs.
As of today, the prevalence of 
complex care patients is, one 
out of 1000 in the commercially 
insured population and 5- to 
10-fold higher in the Medicare 
population, according to the 
American Journal of Managed 
Care.
In addition, Halpert said he 
hopes that other health plans 
and delivery systems (most no
tably Medicare) would consider 
a similar PCM approach. He 
said that so far no other health 
plans in California have initi
ated PCM, but that some other 
plans in other parts of the coun
try have implemented a similar 
program.
No other program has as
sessed outcomes with a study 
design as vigorous as Blue Shield 
of Californias, Halpert said.
Girls to interview local scientists
by Shweta Kumar
Staffwriter
This spring, a new radio pro
gram called GirlTalk will begin 
as a collaboration between the 
Carnegie Science Centers Girls, 
Math & Science Partnership 
(GMSP) and The Saturday Light 
Brigade, an award-winning pub
lic radio program.
The program will be hosted 
by girls, ages 11 to 15, with help 
from the producers of The Satur
day Light Brigade, whose studio 
the girls will be using.
GMSP, according to the Carn
egie Science Centers website, 
is a focused campaign to influ
ence and support girls interest 
and participation in math, sci
ence, and technology in schools 
and for future careers.
Kim Bonenberger, market
ing communications manager 
at the Carnegie Science Center, 
stated in a March press release, 
Participants will interview 
woman scientists working in 
the Pittsburgh region in science, 
math, engineering, and tech
nology fields, then turn those 
interviews into a series of radio 
broadcasts and podcasts.
Jennifer Stancil, executive 
director of GMSP, said that the 
program was inspired by the 
desire to . do virtual mentoring 
in a new way, to enhance girls 
knowledge of technology by us
ing regional assets like The Sat
urday Light Brigade radio show 
and expertise, [and] to continue 
to place positive media images of 
women in math and science as 
the current images are rare and 
the women are not diverse.
The Carnegie Science Cen
ter press release points out that 
the scientists who will be inter
viewed will be both established 
and emerging in their fields.
These scientists come from 
a wide range of backgrounds, 
including food chemistry, nano
technology, and environmental 
science. In the program, they 
will talk about their area of 
expertise and how they are im
pacting them.
A team of broadcasters will 
instruct the girls on how to 
use the production equipment. 
Bonenberger stated that they 
will provide participants with 
hands-on training in interview
ing, digital recording, and audio 
production, thus giving partici
pants control of the process and 
exposure to the latest in digital 
audio technology.
In addition to interviewing 
Pittsburgh scientists, Stancil said 
that the girls will be mentored by 
a number of other professionals. 
These professionals include the 
staff of The Saturday Light Bri
gade and Kate Long from West 
Virginia public radio.

ideas. We learn a lot from their 
feedback, he said.
In addition to having regular 
meetings with a game designer, 
Rheinfrank said that the team 
has also been involved in the 
brainstorming sessions for the 
project.
Rheinfrank said, We came up 
with what were working on.... 
We were given complete creative 
freedom.
Kim said that his team 
members  two artists, two 
programmers, one sound spe
cialist, two game designers, and 
one producer  work closely as 
well.
Theyre really, really tal
ented, and we learn from them, 
Kim said.
As the sound specialist, Kim 
said that he makes music and 
sound effects for the game.
In particular, he uses a synthe
sizer, bass guitar, electric guitar, 
and virtual instrument to create 
the appropriate sounds.
Kim said, I have to think [in] 
a new way, a different way to 
make music  how could this 
music be interactive, how could 
this sound be interactive?
It is also Rheinfranks first 
time working on a game.
This is the first interactive 
project that Ive been able to work 
on long term, said Rheinfrank.
Rheinfrank, who has a back
ground in film, said that the 
principles of filmmaking are 
similar to those of game cre
ation. In particular, he said that 
it is important to consider what 
the audience gains from the ex
perience.
What do you want to show 
them ... to take away, Rhein
frank said. Thats pretty much 
the same from video games to 
film.
Despite having never made 
music for a game before, Kim 
said that it is not difficult to bring 
it all together. He said, Its quite 
fun and quite easy.

serve as a mentor for GirlTalk.
Sixteen girls will be chosen to 
enter the GirlTalk program based 
on their enthusiasm and motiva
tion, and they can have a variety 
of interests. Stancil said, We are 
trying to ensure a diverse repre
sentation around the city of girls 
of various ages. They do not all 
have to love science. There is an 
interesting cross section in the 
applicants of science girls and 
theater/drama/radio girls. 
Bonenberger said that the 
chosen girls will be excited, ad
venturous, curious, and willing 
to work hard; interested in talk
ing to adults and learning about 
what they do; and fascinated by 
science, technology, digital au
dio, radio, and/or podcasting. 
Stancil said that she wants 
the GirlTalk program to help the 
girls gain confidence in solving 
problems.
Stancil said, I want them to 
see that they can do science, 
they can inquire and be curi
ous  that they are the building 
blocks for success in science and 
in solving problems, I want them 
to create awesome podcasts and 
at their red-carpet premiere say 
they are proud of their work. 
The interviews will be avail
able as podcasts from www. 
braincake.org and will debut on 
air in the summer of 2007, after 
their kickoff at the Carnegie Sci
ence Center.

Bong Hits 4 Jesus: Protected speech?
Music is a process of copying, 
borrowing, growing, evolving
Chances are that when 18-year-old 
Joseph Frederick held up a 14-foot long 
banner reading Bong Hits 4 Jesus in 
2002, he didnt anticipate a run-in with 
the Supreme Court. But Frederick, who 
was a senior at Juneau-Douglas High 
School in Juneau, Alaska, probably also 
didnt anticipate that the schools princi
pal, Deborah Morse, would accuse him 
of promoting drug use and suspend him 
for 10 days. Frederick sued Morse and 
lost at the district level, but he won in 
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Morse, with the support of the school 
board, brought the case to the Supreme 
Court, which deliberated on the subject 
last Monday.
Frederick claimed that he was only 
exercising his right to free speech. The 
school argued that it had the right to 
punish students whose free speech pro
motes illegal activity or interferes with 
school policies. Morse accused Freder
ick of promoting the use of illegal drugs, 
an action which she claimed both adver
tised illegal activity and went against 
the schools anti-drug policy.
Frederick was not standing on school 
property when he held the banner above 
his head; however, the incident occurred 
at a school-sponsored event, which al
lowed Morse to claim that Frederick 
was technically in school at the time. As 
a result, Morse claimed that Frederick
School is a trying time for everyone. 
But for children who are clinically obese, 
school can be unbearable. Prescribing a 
quick, easy pill to cause weight loss in 
obese youths seems like a win-win situ
ation.
Many pediatricians have found that 
prescribing medication for attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
specifically the drug Adderall, can curb 
an overweight childs appetite, and 
promote weight loss. A recent article 
on CNN.com followed the story of Alex 
Veith, who at age 11 was 30 pounds 
overweight (despite his healthy life
style) and to whom doctors prescribed 
Adderall.
Veith lost the weight he needed to over 
the course of a single summer, but his 
overall health may not have benefited. 
Veiths parents said that before losing 
the weight, their son was headed for
was under the schools jurisdiction and 
therefore subject to the schools conse
quences.
The school proceeded with Fredericks 
punishment under the assumption that 
once the bell rings, the schools values 
trump those of the student, even when 
that student is not physically present on 
school property.
Students personal values will affect 
them much more significantly than the 
values of their high schools or colleges 
will. Take the 1969 landmark case Tinker 
v. Des Moines Independent Community 
School District, which ruled that a high 
schools suspension of three students for 
wearing black armbands in protest of 
the Vietnam War was unconstitutional. 
The court stated that, according to the 
First Amendment, a public school could 
not punish a student for peacefully pro
testing unless it had evidence that the 
action substantially interfered with 
school policies or the rights of others.
The Supreme Court will decide if the 
Tinker ruling can be applied to Morse 
v. Frederick, deciding ultimately if pro
drug legalization statements can be 
prohibited by school districts.
Fredericks banner, however, was 
not pro-drug legalization; it was not 
pro-anything. Its message did not even 
include a verb, and therefore cannot be 
said to have instructed students to do
Type 2 diabetes. However, preventing 
the onset of diabetes with a drug whose 
side effects include insomnia, nervous
ness, addiction, and even death, defeats 
the purpose of trying to make a child 
healthier in the first place.
The Food and Drug Administration 
has not approved the use of ADHD medi
cations for treating obesity. This hasnt 
stopped doctors from prescribing ADHD 
medication, though. It is perfectly legal 
for doctors to prescribe medication off 
label, and many do, even though, ac
cording to Dr. John Lantos, professor of 
pediatrics at the University of Chicago, 
Its morally and medically question
able, so I dont think anyones proud of 
doing this.
Parents too should be held account
able. Despite the risks and difficulties 
of having a clinically overweight child, 
parents must recognize the danger of
anything. On the other hand, the sign 
did draw students attention to illegal 
activity.
The statement was, if anything, a 
harmless joke more for the benefit and 
amusement of Frederick himself than 
anyone else. Nothing in the signs con
tent suggested that its readers take a 
particular action, legal or illegal.
Based on its own personal beliefs, the 
schools administration took the course 
of action that it felt was ethical. It failed 
to take into account the rights and be
liefs of the student in question as well 
as those of his fellow students and their 
parents, but hopefully the Supreme 
Court will not make that same error. It 
should err, as always, on the side of free 
speech.
Supreme Court Justice Breyer per
fectly articulated the difficulty of this 
case: I guess what Im worried about 
is a rule ... that takes [the defendants] 
side; well suddenly see people test
ing limits all over the place in the high 
schools. But a rule that [is] against your 
side may really limit peoples rights on 
free speech. Thats what Im struggling 
with. We hope the court remembers 
that this country (and our educational 
system) is founded upon the notion of 
testing limits. That is how our society 
grows and develops. The Supreme Court 
should uphold this important value.
and resist the urge to medicate their 
children.
Adderall is already abused on col
lege campuses as a study aid and quick 
fix for sleep deprivation. Imagine a new 
generation of college students, who are 
already used to popping pills, tackling 
a homework assignment or project by 
heading not for the library, but the med
icine cabinet.
It is a bleak prospect to consider that 
someday there may be more demand for 
a 24-hour pharmacy on campus than 
gym facilities. Kids may find the process 
of diet and exercise way too arduous 
compared to just taking a few pills. But 
prescribing a quick-fix drug to forestall a 
condition that might otherwise be treat
able through a stricter diet and more ex
ercise only teaches children that doing 
something the hard way isnt worth the 
extra effort.

College students scream the words to 
Sublimes What I Got, plastic red cups 
(filled with God knows what) in hand as 
Friday night fades away. Parents relax 
on the back patio of suburbia as Woodie 
Guthries This Land is Your Land eases 
from the family turntable. Nightclubs 
thump as Kanye Wests Gold Digger 
pounds, instantly getting people off 
their asses and to the dance floor.
So whats the big deal? Every group 
has a staple song, one that defines the 
band. But what would we think if we 
knew that all three of these staple songs
 and many otherswere not as origi
nal as we thought? It just so happens 
that the melody to What I Got is lifted 
from The Beatles Lady Madonna. 
This Land Is Your Land is really a Bap
tist hymn, recorded previously by The 
Carter Family. Gold Digger, though 
less subtle, samples the Ray Charles 
number I Got a Woman, which itself 
was borrowed from the gospel tune Je
sus Is All the World to Me.
Crap. So three of my favorite songs 
arent even the real thing. Theyre 
fake. Screw Sublime. Damn Woodie 
Guthrie. Yet another uncool move by 
Kanye, but I guess thats expected. Even 
Ray Charles! The one guy who everyone 
thought had the right to be singing the 
blues is jacking his material from other 
people. Im pissed.
But lets take a step back here before 
we get all worked up. Should the fact 
that these songs dont belong to these 
artists make a difference in how we 
evaluate them? Not necessarily. People
(Re: Stressful culture contributes to 
CAPS waitlist, Feb. 26) I am obligated 
to correct the central thesis that students 
are being waitlisted for appointments 
at CAPS. If I were a student in need of 
counseling and were told that there was 
a three-week wait to get in, I may not 
bother to call for an appointment. One 
of the things we strive for at CAPS is re
ducing the barriers to any students abil
ity and willingness to get mental health 
care on campus. When we begin to ap
proach capacity in terms of caseloads, 
we hire additional staff to help meet the 
demand for service. During peak times, 
there are situations in which students 
with only one or two hours available in 
their schedule have to wait a week for 
an appointment, but this is exceptional. 
CAPS has not had a waitlist for quite 
some time and as many students can 
attest, Diane Mazzocca, our adminis
trative coordinator, has been known to 
work miracles for students in need of an 
appointment!

(Re: Protestors wage war on CMU 
military contracting, March 5) Using 
the reasoning of David Meieran and The 
Tartans own columnists, I have come 
to the conclusion that we should equip 
our army with swords and bows and ar
rows. I suppose thats the best way to 
avoid soulless war.
People need to pick their battles and 
use their energies a little better. If weve 
reached the point as a country that 
were going to invade another country, 
then we should aim to minimize the loss 
of life (particularly our own) as much as 
possible. Protesting our country going 
to war or the amount of money being 
spent on weapons research would be
are stealing music left and right, as we 
can see. But if we dont care about who 
wrote the song, and the melody of these 
covers is the same as the original ver
sion, what do we care about?
Besides the bare essentials of the 
song (the melody and chord changes), 
there are two critical components to 
consider: style and personality. Style 
pertains to the factors that are crucial 
in helping answer questions like, In 
what section of Tower Records would I 
find this band? and What type of vibe 
is the artist trying to give off? Style is 
crunchy guitars in Metallicas Master of 
Puppets. A rainy day in Pittsburgh might 
call for the murky, brooding style of In
terpols NYC.
Personality is much harder to define 
and assess than style, simply because 
it comes in so many more forms than 
style does. Personality answers ques
tions like, What is the artist trying to 
say? and, Just who is this guy that Im 
listening to? Personality allows us to 
trust the artist, to see their world and 
their ideas. Its the force that makes you 
pick that fro out when Sly Stone yelps, 
Daaance to the music! When Chuck D 
from Public Enemy raps, 911 is a joke, 
its his convictive personality that makes 
you question modern authority figures. 
Its a powerful thing, this music.
So next time you crank a tune at a 
party, put on fluffy headphones before 
you go to bed, or just kick it in the dorm, 
dont fret over who wrote the song or 
who has the right to be playing what. 
Does this music resonate with you, or 
not?
Matt Siffert is a sophomore studying 
music snobbery. He probably will delete

Once moneys been allotted to mili
tary research, we should get the best 
soulless killing machines possible 
(ignoring for a moment any arguments 
that might arise from having watched 
Terminator 2). Military and govern
ment research has always spawned 
useful consumer technologies. Theyd 
probably also encourage you to visit a 
military hospital and see the thousands 
of soldiers who are coming back from 
this war with traumatic injuries. Theyd 
probably suggest you look at the toll war

then decide if you dont want to give 
those who are putting their lives on the 
line the best killing machines possible.

(Re: Killer robots pose moral and 
branding issues for University, March 
5) As one of the members of POG that 
was arrested on March 2, I greatly ap
preciated the article Ms. Lukiewski and 
Ms. Cahill wrote. The article was ex
tremely well written and the perspective 
that the authors took was both positive 
and intelligently articulated. They ex
plained the situation accurately, and 
really made the connections that we in 
POG hoped would be made between 
NREC, CMU, and warfare. I honestly 
think that because of their editorial, 
many students will be more aware of 
the facility of NREC and perhaps want 
to take a stronger stance against it and 
other structures linked to perpetuating 
a war mentality. I encourage everyone 
to stay involved in the anti-war move
ment and progressive issues in general!

THE TARTAN  MARCH 26, 2007
Prudish filmmaking in U.S. doesnt compare to foreign flicks
goes on. These movies have their 
a 2, 2 0O ___ share of cross-dressing men.y/kdiL.lhp
Rachael Clemmons
I once thought life couldnt 
get any better, but a new Netflix 
subscription has changed all 
that. My new love has led me 
to quite the discovery: Foreign 
films are exhilarating. The plots 
are amazing, the dialogue is 
sharp, and nudity isnt limited 
to just women. Yes! That liberal 
attitude toward plotlines and 
male nudity, clearly lacking in 
America, spurs foreign films to 
great heights. Foreign films are 
the new cool.
Is the lack of said liberalness 
in American films a reflection 
of our breast-obsessed society? 
Thats irrelevant to me at the mo
ment. My entertainment is much 
more important. Highly ac
claimed American movies can be 
subpar. Remember when Halle 
Berry won that Academy Award 
for Monsters Ball in 2002? I do. 
After watching that horrendous 
excuse for a movie, all I can re
member was a rather explicit 
and haphazard sex scene fea
turing Madame Berrys goodies. 
Remember the following year, 
when the Cuarn brothers were 
nominated for Best Screenplay 
for Y tu mam tambin? Me nei
ther. But I do remember seeing 
this movie repeatedly, though 
the exact number of times is too 
excessive to admit. And I must 
say, it is a much better cinematit 
achievement than Monsters Ball. 
It features much more nudity, es
pecially featuring glorious male 
frontals, and much more (MUCH 
MORE!) sex. Not to mention, it 
features a lot more of the impec
cable Gael Garcia Bernal, who 
seems to keep popping up in my 
articles. (That will be his last 
mention.)
Have you ever experienced Pe
dro Almodovar? He is spectacu
lar. Volver, La Mala educacin, 
Todo sobre mi madre. The list
goes on. These movies have their 
share of cross-dressing men, 
transvestites, and frank portray
als of sex. Almodovar seems to 
understand that a movie just isnt 
a movie without a hilarious mur
der, a tragic man with knockers 
the size of watermelons, or the 
representation of sex and lust in 
realistic terms. Yes! Its not just 
people rolling around in dirt, 
claiming they had sex after
wards. Quite the contrary  if 
someone in an Almodovar film 
says they had sex, you can attest 
to it. Youve seen it. All of it. And 
youve probably also enjoyed it.
La Science des rves, known by 
its English title as The Science of 
Sleep, is yet another instance of 
a superb foreign film. It is the 
kind  with a little bit of na
kedness, attributed to the man 
Ive promised not to mention 
again  that America would be 
too unadventurous to think of 
and too hesitant to make. It has 
imagination and unusual hu
mor that is atypical of American 
cinema: Its like touching your 
penis with your left hand, says 
Stphane, the movies protago
nist, to Stphanie. I dont have a 
penis, she retorts. But you have 
a left hand, Stphane reminds 
her. Classic, I know. And whats 
more, I have a left hand too. Any
way, the fabulous Frenchman 
Michel Gondry was the writer 
and director of the film, and we 
all know the French have some 
serious street cred in the areas of 
fashion, food, and film.
American movies dont do it 
for me anymore. There just isnt 
enough of anything. I mean, 
there are always the indie films, 
and I enjoy Sofia Coppola. (Well, 
I enjoyed that Lost in Translation 
was so deep, even though I didnt 
understand what was going on. 
Too many underlying messages.) 
And it was okay that there wasnt 
any male nudity: The lack of 
genitalia in American films is not 
what makes them blah. Every
thing is the same now: Kapow!
Someone is shot, someone shows 
her rack, and then the movie is 
over. Foreign films have more 
substance, more creative matter. 
And they can be deep, but still 
accessible enough for me to un
derstand whats going on.
Besides, it seems that mov
ies that are considered risqu in 
America wouldnt get the same 
reaction in other countries. Con
sider Brokeback Mountain, the 
quintessential gay love story in 
the States. There was an over
load of controversy about Heath, 
Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall gettin it on  and honestly, there 
wasnt even that much naked
ness. Take that same film and 
make it European. Theres no 
uproar, just a movie. Gay cow
boys? Just a detail. Those sex 
scenes? A little prudish. Cin
ematic achievement? Why, of 
course. Why cant America be as 
nonchalant? Arent we supposed 
to be all about democracy and 
freedom and stuff?
All right, away from politics. 
All Im saying is that foreign 
films are the shit. And, as I cant 
mention enough, there is a lot of
Michelle Lee/Art Staff
nakedness, a lot of sex, a lot of 
talk about penises (and maybe 
even left hands) in general, as 
seen in The Science of Sleep. Most 
importantly, there is a lot of soul 
in these films. Less censorship 
and more tolerance means bet
ter movies. And America simply 
cant compare.
And as far as hope for us 
Americans  well, theres al
ways Sofia Coppola.

Unfortunately, at Carnegie Mellon, design is more like robotics
f_______________Kristen Lukiewski
One of the hippest figures in the world 
right now is Banksy, a ballsy Brit who has 
established a portfolio for himself thats 
a brilliant hybrid of guerilla art, graphic 
design, graffiti, and unadulterated tal
ent. Check out his manifesto: Its a page 
taken from the diary of WWII Lieutenant 
Colonel Mervin Willett Gonin, who wrote 
about the disease and death surrounding 
him, and the genius who sent lipstick to 
the camp instead of food. At last some
one had done something to make them 
individuals again, he wrote.
Banksys manifesto points to debilitat
ing misconceptions.in Carnegie Mellons 
design department. Individuality provides 
a wealth of creative and nontraditional 
solutions, and sometimes the seemingly 
unnecessary and gratuitous design solves 
a different, and possibly equally impor
tant, problem than the clear answer. 
Sometimes, you have to do the unex
pected.
Our design program is touted as one of 
the best in the country, yet visits to design 
firms have revealed potential employers 
unimpressed with our work, and mur
murs of Oh, another Carnegie Mellon 
portfolio? at interviews have shown the 
nature of the work students are churning 
out here: clean, efficient, and good, yes, 
but all the same.
Ignore the fact that the work we see 
hanging on IDEOs walls is distinctly dif
ferent in principle from Carnegie Mellons, 
ignore the fact that were being taught 
design that caters to one class of people 
(middle- to upper-class, style-conscious 
clients); the design department is con
tinuing a long Carnegie Mellon tradition 
by making robots of us all. .
Design students are about as diverse 
as you will find at an upper-crust school: 
Within that pre-defined demographic we
tion design majors are in Maggie Mo and 
industrial design majors are in Porter is 
extreme and detrimental; it denies the 
possibility of 2-D work influencing or 
working in conjunction with 3-D work, 
and vice versa.
From the beginning, the assignments 
are ones of homogenization. Do not sketch. 
Draw one line. Do not use your eraser. 
Make one stroke. Freshman year sees

straight lines in inch-long increments,

have the typical ratios of class and race 
represented. The students come from 
predominantly fine arts, photography, 
drafting, or design backgrounds, but by 
the end of four years in the program, you 
wouldnt be able to tell given the results of 
studio projects.
The environment contributes to the as
similation within the program. Studios 
are bare, equipment is minimal, prices
 for things like studio fees and even the 
most basic of design elements, color print
ing  are high, and therefore restrictive. 
The set up of the program is such that 
students spend a year bonding just to be 
drastically split by major and distance. 
To go from spending a year together in 
Maggie Mo to a year where communica
eventually turning into simple 2-D  and 
then 3-D  shapes. Its hard to think out
side the box when you spend weeks per
fecting squares and cubes.
The small crop of professors means stu
dents are being circulated within the same 
pod of design ideals year in and year out. 
Professors form an answer to the design 
prompt assigned, and reject most any
thing that challenges the enforced style 
norm or is different from their expected 
outcome. In communication design, 
where one professor teaches and grades 
at a time, there is less objective analysis 
of any single design and less input for the 
students to draw from. Professors say not 
to care about the grade, to do the work for 
yourself; but work done to the satisfaction
of the student consistently receives lower 
grades.
The rejection of individuality strips 
students of their passion for design, stu
dents slowly stop caring, and as peer 
expectation drops, so does motivation, 
and, in turn, production quality. Students 
dedicate more and more of their time to 
alternate classes and extracurriculars, 
where they want to learn the material.
Design is inherently a combination 
of creative ideas, where inspiration is 
drawn from a constant flow of informa
tion and reinterpretation. Openness to 
variety breeds innovation, a typical trait 
Carnegie Mellon prides itself on, but type 
surrounded by white space is getting 
tired, as is having to explain away every 
detail and function of any object. Some
times, its okay for a part of a design to be 
decorative.
Visiting lecturer James Victore was 
asked about creativity restrictions in the 
classroom, to which he reluctantly re
sponded that, well, students have to start 
somewhere. Hes right, you cant break 
the rules without learning them first, but 
theres value in the belief that you cant 
say youll keep all the rules now and break 
all the rules later. My dads mantra is bet
ter: You have to practice- the way youre 
going to play. And I want to play by my 
own rules.

Perspectives
With advocacy, 
one person can 
make an impact
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
A couple weeks ago I was con
tacted by a male, student who 
was concerned about his experi
ence at Health Services. He had 
tried to purchase Emergency 
Contraception (EC) for a female 
friend. Health Services turned 
him away. The female student 
would have to be present for 
him to receive EC. He ended up 
trying three more pharmacies 
before finding EC and it was at a 
much higher price. The student 
contacted me to express his 
frustration  why should he be 
turned away from buying such 
an important product?
I addressed the students con
cern. I contacted Anita Barkin, 
director of Health Services, to 
discuss the students experi
ence and how we could move 
forward on changing Health 
Services policy to enable male 
students to purchase EC. Megan 
Larcom (Student Senate Chair 
of Campus Life), Joanna Dickert (Housefellow), Anita, and
I all sat down to talk about the 
current campus policy and this 
particular students concerns.
We discovered that the re
vised policy clearly stated that 
males of age could purchase 
EC at any time. Our meeting 
quickly moved from policy to 
implementation; we all helped 
to define what a purchase pro
cess should look like  how 
to inform students so that 
theyre more responsible sexual 
decision makers while still pro
viding them with a convenient 
and affordable resource.
Under the new process, stu
dents will undergo a sexual 
history screening before receiv
ing a packet with Plan B (EC), a 
condom, and information about 
all the forms of birth control.
So what does EC do? EC has 
been called the best kept secret 
in medicine by the American 
College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, It is the most 
effective way of preventing 
unintended pregnancies when 
another method of birth control 
has failed. If taken within 120 
hours of sexual intercourse, EC 
can successfully prevent the de
velopment of a large number of 
pregnancies.
EC is not a replacement for 
other forms of birth control, 
including condoms. EC is much 
less effective than traditional 
methods of birth control. It 
is a last resort, not a replace
ment. Health Services offers 
EC to help students become 
more autonomous, informed, 
and responsible sexual decision 
makers. Now male students 
have that privilege, too.
All it took was one student 
and one meeting and the cam
pus EC policy was changed. 
Thats the power of advocacy.

prospered and ultimately collapsed. His 
Pulitzer Prize winning book Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fate of Human

by Christina Collura
Staffwriter
If you are a fan of Carnegie 
Mellon athletic events, its 
almost certain that at some 
point or another you have seen 
Susan Bassett, the athletics di
rector, in the crowd. Bassett, 
came to Carnegie Mellon in 
2005 from William Smith 
College, in Geneva, N.Y. She 
can always be found around 
campus supporting varsity 
and club teams and oversee
ing the physical education 
department. This week, to get 
the opinion of an expert, The 
Tartan sat down with Bassett 
to talk about Tartan athletics.
Tartan: At several other 
colleges, you accomplished 
a lot within athletics. What 
in particular brought you to 
Carnegie Mellon?
Bassett: First and foremost,
I was excited to be coming 
to a world-class academic in
stitution. I also really liked 
Pittsburgh, I think its a re
ally fun and interesting place, 
and I liked the UAA confer
ence. When I was looking at 
the school, and its programs, 
and its facilities, I felt like it 
was somewhere I could make 
some improvements and have 
an impact on campus life.
T: In your first years here, 
is there anything specific you 
have instituted that you are 
really proud of?
B: We have done a lot of 
really great stuff with the or
ganization of the department. 
We have established certain 
procedures and systems to 
make sure everything runs 
smoothly, and the department 
just seems so much more ef
ficient. Theres also been a 
lot done with facility devel
opment, new turf was put 
in Gesling Stadium, and we
designed and built the Cost 
Varsity Weight Room in Skibo 
Gymnasium.
T: What program do you 
think has come the farthest 
sincie you came to Carnegie 
Mellon?
B: Well, we have had a lot 
of really great individual and 
team performances. Weve 
had students win a couple of 
national titles. Mens basket
ball did very well last year, and 
tennis is doing extremely well 
this season. However, I have 
to say that the football team 
has made the 'most progress. 
They went from 5-5 a year 
ago to 10-0 this season. I cant 
take any credit for it; it was 
the players and coaches, but 
they've done really well.
T: What is the most excit
ing athletic event you have 
attended this year?
B: I would have to say the 
NCAA playoff game the foot
ball team hosted. It was the 
first time the team had made 
the NCAA playoffs since 1990, 
and they won, which I believe 
was a first ever. It was just in
credible to have that brought 
here-and to have so many stu
dents be there to support the 
team. It was all very exciting.
T: Carnegie Mellons ath
letic teams frequently travel 
for competition, and almost 
every student athlete has a fa
vorite place they have traveled 
to. Is there any one place you 
got to travel with one of the 
teams that you enjoyed?
B: Chicago. This year I got 
to go to Chicago with the bas
ketball teams, and it was such 
a nice trip. We had decent 
weather, and Chicago was 
such a beautiful city. I really 
enjoyed being there.
T: As athletic director you 
are very involved with varsity 
sports and university physi
cal education classes. How 
involved are you with more 
student-based organizations, 
such as club and intramural 
athletic teams?
B: I actually also supervise 
club and intramural activities,  
and we have recently orga
nized a Club Sport Council, 
which is an organization I am 
very proud of, for the club 
teams to have more of a voice 
in the community and proper 
use of facilities.
Carnegie Mellon athletes 
excel over spring break
by Sarah Mogin
Pillbox Editor
It was a good time to be a stu
dent athlete this spring break at 
Carnegie Mellon.
On March 10, CIT sophomore 
Brian Harvey triumphed at the 
NCAA indoor track and field 
championships, where he landed 
on the mens All-American list.
Nobody else has ever made 
nationals for guys, said Harvey, 
a double major in mechanical 
and biomedical engineering. For 
Carnegie Mellon, he is the first 
male indoor track and field athegie Mellon a point in the team 
category. Overall, the Tartans 
earned 52nd place in a tie with 
several other schools.

admitted that, after each race, 
he always pushes himself to do 
better. Still, an eighth-place fin

SPORTS COMMENTAS*
Sixty-one games played, three to go
Doug Fricker
The NCAA mens basketball 
tournament is becoming one 
of the most popular sporting 
events in the nation. The Super 
Bowl is still in first place, but 
it seems that March Madness 
has surpassed the World Series 
for the number-two spot. This 
years tournament has unfolded 
with dozens of close games, but 
very few upsets.
It started with 65 teams and 
is now down to only four. Sixtyone games have been played and 
61 teams have seen their hopes 
and dreams shattered with a 
loss. Up to this point, there have 
only been four major upsets, 
defined as the winning team 
being three or more seeds lower 
than their opponent. The first 
round saw two of these upsets, 
with the llth-seeded Virginia 
Commonwealth (VCU) upset
ting the sixth-seeded Duke, and 
11th seed Winthrop beating 
sixth-seeded Notre Dame.
Duke limped into March 
after an uncharacteristically 
disappointing regular season 
in which Duke finished tied 
for sixth in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference. VCU guard Eric 
Maynor hit a jumper with 1.8 
seconds left to give the Rams 
the win over Duke at 79-77. 
Dukes impressive string of nine 
straight Sweet 16 appearances 
was snapped as they lost in the 
first round for the first time 
since 1996.
Winthrop plays in the Big 
South Conference, so they dont 
get much publicity, but they qui
etly put together a great regular 
season and were ranked 21st 
overall in the latest USA Today/ESPN poll, so their 74-64 
victory over the Fighting Irish 
wasnt surprising.
In the second round, we saw 
two more upsets, with seventh 
seed University of Nevada-Las 
Vegas (UNLV) defeating the 
second seed Wisconsin 74-68, 
and sixth seed Vanderbilt beat
ing third seed Washington 
State 78-74 in double overtime. 
UNLV took advantage of the fact 
that the Badgers were playing 
without starting center Brian 
Butch, who dislocated his elbow 
in a scary fall in a game a month 
ago. His presence was obvi
ously missed due to their early 
exit and the fact that they al
most lost their first round game 
against the 15th-seeded Texas 
A&M Corpus Christi. Wiscon
sin found themselves down by 
18 points before they regained 
their composure to win 76-63.
The game between Van
derbilt and Washington State 
was an instant classic and the 
only game in the tournament 
to go into double overtime. 
Vanderbilt, behind Southeast
ern Conference Player of the 
Year Derrick Byars 27 points, 
had a chance to win the game 
in regulation but his shot was 
blocked. Then, in the first over
time, Byars returned the favor 
by blocking the potential gamewinning layup with less than 10 
seconds left.
Although all four numberone seeds, three two seeds, and 
a three seed made it into the 
Elite Eight, do not be led to the 
false conclusion that there isnt 
parity in college basketball. All 
eight of the teams that made 
the Elite Eight had close calls in 
their first three victories.
Florida had its hands full with 
two Indiana teams, Purdue and 
Butler. Oregon narrowly edged 
the 14th seed, Miami (Ohio), in 
the first round and UNLV in the 
Sweet 16. Kansas beat Southern 
Illinois by only three, and UCLA 
had to survive a late scare from 
Indiana in the second round.
North Carolina won its three 
games by 10 points or more, 
but Michigan State and USC 
proved to be worthy opponents. 
Georgetown rallied to beat Bos
ton College in the second round 
and then defeated Vanderbilt on 
a last-second shot from Big East 
Player of the Year Jeff Green.
Ohio State had the most im
probable run of any team in 
the tournament, snatching vic
tory from the clutches of defeat 
twice, against Xavier in the 
second round and Tennessee in 
the Sweet 16. Ohio State rallied 
from 11 points down against 
Xavier, capped off by a long 
three-pointer with two seconds 
left by Ron Lewis to force over
time.
The Buckeyes then went on 
to defeat the Musketeers 78-71. 
Ohio State needed to rally again
against Tennessee, as it found 
itself down 49-29 right before 
halftime. The Buckeyes pulled 
through as first-year guard Mike 
Conley Jr. made one of two free 
throws with 6.5 seconds left to 
put Ohio State up 85-84. Ten
nessees Ramar Smith dribbled 
the length of the court and put 
up the potential game-winning 
shot as time expired, only to 
have first-year center and poten
tial first-round NBA draft pick 
Greg Oden swat the ball out of 
bounds, sealing the victory.
The last Elite Eight team 
was Memphis, who defied the 
odds in their win over Texas 
A&M in the Sweet 16. Down 
by one with 3.1 seconds left, 
Antonio Anderson had two 
free throw attempts. He had 
missed his previous three free 
throws; Memphis was one of 
the nations worst free-throwshooting teams. So naturally 
Anderson sank both shots to put 
Memphis in front 65-64 and 
give them the win after Texas 
A&Ms buzzer-beater shot was 
woefully short.
The selection committee 
did a good job setting up the 
bracket this year. The games 
have been exciting as ever, even 
despite the fact that there isnt 
a George Mason of this years 
tournament. The two Final Four 
games will be Saturday, with 
the championship on Monday, 
April 2. If this trend of close 
games continues, expect some 
last-second heroics before the 
national champion is crowned.

Teenage Mutant Ninja life lessons
On screen: Donatello does tech support, Raphael goes vigilante
What would you pay to be a child again, even just 
for 87 minutes? How about $9?
This weekend saw the release of the new 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, TMNT, 
and its everything you would expect from a 
computer-animated film resurrecting one of 
the most beloved cartoon franchises of our 
generation's childhood.
For the few out there who never got in on 
the turtle phenomenon, heres a quick cheat 
sheet: Four turtles get exposed to some spooky 
mutagenic ooze and rapidly grow into humanoid 
creatures with the personalities of excitable 
teenagers. Forced to live in hiding in the sewers 
of New York, the turtles train with their master, 
Splinter  a mutated, humanoid rat who either 
belonged to a ninjitsu master or was a ninjitsu 
master, depending on who you ask. The turtles 
bind together as a crime-fighting team, fighting 
all sorts of cartoon foes  aliens, immortal ninjas, 
monsters, etc.  and generally have a good time 
doing it. Oh, and they also really like pizza.
The turtles originally debuted in an independent 
comic book in 1984. Their adventures have been 
chronicled sporadically in print ever since, but 
the medium in which most current highschool 
and college students first got their turtle fix was 
the animated TV show, which started in 1987. 
Three live-action Turtles films came out in the 
early '90s, and all were big successes; the cartoonshow went on to last until 1996, with a second 
series airing in 2003 that appears on Saturday 
mornings to this day.
The Turtles were also the core of a notorious 
merchandising bonanza, and a quick walk 
through a Toys "R Us today would prove that this 
is still very much the case. Nevertheless, the new 
movie is clearly trying to bring old fans back into 
the fold, as well as introducing new ones to the 
world and story.
Whats interesting about TMNT is that its not 
a redone origin story, like so many other comic 
book movies that have come out recently. Instead, 
TMNT plunges you right into the newest chapter 
of the story. Very little backstory is given: A bit 
of narration at the beginning sets up the history 
behind-the latest foe, and includes probably two 
sentences shedding some light on the turtles 
themselves. And seriously, if you haven't already 
' been introduced to the concept of mutant ninja 
turtles, why are you sitting in this movie theater?
The story begins thousands of years ago, when 
a powerful warlord and his generals were struck 
by a cosmic blast, cursing them with immortality. 
The cosmic blast also opened some sort of portal, 
unleashing thirteen beasts that would rampage 
across the planet for ages.
We then move to present-day Central America, 
where Leonardo, head of the turtles, is 
soul-searching to develop his leadership skills.
He doesnt want to come home because he
feels he cannot return without some concrete 
evidence that he is a better leader. Unfortunately 
for Leonardo, his brothers aren't exactly getting 
along swimmingly in his absence.
Donatello the tech geek and Michelangelo the 
party animal have both taken on jobs to fill the 
space in their lives that crime-fighting used to 
occupy. In a cute twist, Donatello is working 24/7 
tech support over the phone, and Michelangelo 
is entertaining at childrens birthday parties, 
wearing a giant foam turtle head. The world does 
not, of course, know that the turtles exist.
The third brother, Raphael, is not satisfied sitting 
idle while crime runs free. Hes taken on a new 
persona, the Nightwatcher, to dole out vigilante 
justice as the others try to make an honest buck.
When Leonardo returns to lead the team against 
a new foe  it seems a wealthy industrialist is 
trying to resurrect the stone generals and reopen 
the portal  things don't go as smoothly as he 
had hoped. The turtles are out of practice and 
Raphael has a problem following orders.
The bulk of the movie revolves around Leonardo 
and Raphael rebuilding their broken friendship 
more than the evil mastermind and his minions 
scouring New York for mythical beasts. As a 
result, the movie feels far more mature and 
realistic, which is a great feat to accomplish for a 
movie about crime-fighting ninja turtles.
Artistically, the movie is nearly perfect. The 
animation has a cohesive visual style that is 
heavily influenced by comic books and not so 
much by reality. Think Pixar's The Inciedibles, 
complete with spindly women and absurdly 
broad-shouldered men. The coloring is gritty
 this isnt a Saturday morning cartoon by any 
means  and some of the effects are masterful. 
One fight occurs in the rain, and during the scene 
every close-up has a convincing watery sheen 
over all the surfaces.

The voice work, too, is well done, with many 
big-name actors voicing the human roles. Sarah 
Michelle Gellar, Patrick Stewart, and Chris Evans 
all play major parts, even though the voices of 
the turtles themselves are all by veteran voice 
actors whom no one has ever really heard of. The 
problem with the voice work, and sound design 
overall, is that it's not punchy enough. The score 
(which is nothing special, though it serves its 
purpose) is mixed too loudly, and the sound 
effects arent mixed high enough. The result 
sounds muddy and doesnt feel like its present" 
in the theater.
Still, TMNT provides a rewarding, nostalgic look 
back at an influential franchise from our formative 
years. Its fun, quirky, and doesn't have any big 
statements about the nature of humanity or the 
futility of life  its just a bunch of turtles trying 
to find their place in the world.

Everything you need to know
About messy roommates and senior stress.
Dear Janet, Dear Janet,
Heres an easy question with 
a hard answer  Im a neat 
freak and my roommate is a 
slob. Everything else between 
us is groovy, but its getting 
to the point where I want to 
throttle her every time I see 
her because Im so sick of 
cleaning up after her. How can 
I save the friendship without 
drowning in her filth?
Nearly Emotional About 
Trash
Dear NEAT,
What you need to do first is talk to 
yourself. What can you honestly 
absolutely not deal with, and 
what can you learn to live with? 
Right now, you have to accept 
that your roommate will never be 
as neat as you want her to be; 
pick your battles. Then, choose 
a few things to talk about with 
her and see if you can get her to 
agree to (and stick to) them; then 
you can try more changes. Worst 
case scenario, if nothing works 
at all, you can always try'the old 
draw-a-line-down-the-middleof-the-room-with-duct-tape. Or, 
depending on the situation, just 
take all her crap from a common 
area and dump it on her bed or 
in her room, it all depends how 
passive-aggressive you feel like 
being. But all joking aside, talking 
it out is the way to go.
Janet
Im a senior and Im stressing 
out like I never have before! I 
cant sleep, I can barely relax 
because Im so freaked about 
my thesis, my finals, and 
whats going to happen to me 
when I graduate. Help!
These Exploits Never Seem 
Easy
Dear TENSE,
Did you know that CAPS 
(Counseling and Psychological 
Services) is completely free? I 
didnt until someone told me 
recently. You can call them at 
412.268.2922 anytime day or 
night, and theyll hook you up with 
somebody to talk to. Alternatively, 
you can talk to the Career Center 
and Academic Development
 the former can .hook you up 
with some job counseling, and 
the latter can help you with some 
study and organizational skills 
so your workload doesnt seem 
so overwhelming. Overall, don't 
worry! You've almost made it, 
and soon youll be moving on to 
bigger and better things. Youve 
only got a couple more months 
to go  keeping the finish line in 
mind is one of the most important 
things you can do at this point.

Right: Man Man drummer 
Pow Pow rocks out.
Drunken rants and mustache chants
The Hold Steady and Man Man play Pittsburgh
What ever happened to fun, rowdy bands? It seems like 
current music is brimming with dismal, melodramatic acts 
and singers carrying themselves like the next messiah.
What if I just want to go to a show and rock out without 
everyone around me standing with arms crossed, stolid and 
motionless? This week, I found the answer at two concerts in 
the South Side: The Hold Steady and Man Man.
Imagine listening to a Bruce Springsteen album, except 
instead of the Boss singing his wistful, eloquent lyrics, they 
are sung by a surly, ranting drunk.
With that sound, The Hold Steady has steadily gained 
popularity since its first album, 2004's Almost Killed Me. 
Singer/guitarist Craig Finn carries each song with anthemic 
stories about relationships, partying, drugs, and drinking. All 
the while, Finn is seemingly ignorant of the driving music 
behind him, as his voice drifts in and out of tempo and 
melody. But this sloppy style comes as a breath of fresh air 
among the smoke of other acts meticulous composition and 
harmonies.
The Hold Steadys epic ode to carefree adolescence, Boys 
and Girls in America, has earned the band recent acclaim in 
the media: Esquire named Craig Finn the best songwriter of 
2007, and Boys and Girls appeared on both Bolling Stone and 
Pitchfork Media's top ten albums of 2006 list. The band has 
been touring in the US and UK ever since the albums release 
last October.
From listening to their albums, you would expect a Hold 
Steady show to be a raucous, beer-sloshed event. And that's 
exactly what the band brought to the Rex Monday night.
The five band members were rocking on full steam, fueled 
by alcohol. The keyboardist provided classic rock melodies 
and backing vocals, donning a paperboys cap and a waxed 
mustache and often executing 360 spins between playing 
times. Craig Finn mostly used his guitar as an ornament 
rather than a musical instrument, clapping goofily, waving to' 
the crowd, and gesticulating as he ranted lyrics.
In another context, these guys would be laughed off the 
stage, but as The Hold Steady, they become the coolest
dudes you've ever seen. Its like seeing your inebriated father 
perform Rolling Stones karaoke, trying to strut like Mick 
Jagger  and rather than hiding your face, you want to jump 
on stage and join him.
The venue was filled with 20- and 30-somethings who were 
ready and willing to drop their inhibitions, singing and 
dancing along with the band. It could have been the beer in 
the hands of nearly every other person, but even if you were 
sober, Finn had more than enough drunken joy to spread 
to the crowd. The vibe from Finn's lyrics, such as We had 
some massive nights/Every song was right" certainly fit the 
atmosphere in the crowd, where listeners chanted eagerly 
while clapping/fist pumping to the beat.
The set escalated at the end of the encore as the band 
jammed to Killer Parties and reached into the crowd to 
pull people onto the stage, handing off guitars for audience 
members to play. By the end of the song, the stage was filled 
with over 20 smiling people, high-fiving the band members as 
Finn pointed around the venue and slurred out the unifying 
line ...and were all/The Hold Steady.
The next night, just across the street, Man Man took the 
stage at Diesel Club Lounge to lead another fun concert of 
rowdiness and rock. Dressed in white tennis outfits and 
wearing face paint, the members of Man Man grunted, 
shrieked, and growled through their set.
Drummer Pow Pow and singer/keyboardist Honus Honus 
sat in the front of the stage facing each other while the 
three other members stood in the back providing backup 
vocals and rhythms with a barrage of instruments including 
keyboards, xylophone, marimba, guitars, trumpet, saxophone, 
and meldicas. .
As opposed to The Hold Steadys corny-but-cool stage 
presence, Man Man's act gave new meaning to the phrase 
"clever antics": During Push the Eagle's Stomach," the 
band chanted mustache!" over and over while Pow Pow 
and Honus Honus hopped synchronously straight into the 
air. At the beginning of Black Mission Goggles," three of 
the members whipped out plastic noise horns (think New 
Years Eve), which they blew to the beat. At one point, it
even seemed like the band was having a screaming contest, 
as each member took turns yelping into his mic in his own 
absurd style.
But the set was not simply a conglomeration of 
ridiculousness. Amongst the mayhem of the night, the 
members of Man Man came together as a cohesive unit, 
delivering tight, exciting music. Honus Honus provided no 
witty banter between playing; he simply flowed gracefully 
into the next song in order to keep the energy high.
On recordings, Man Man is just as fun and absurd as in - 
concert. Its songs often combine light-hearted romping with 
dark, dismal lyrics to produce a multidimensional mood. The 
sound of its latest flbum, Six Demon Bag, has been compared 
to that of Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa for its vocal 
style and originality. The album received high rankings from 
most music critics. Pitchfork Media named it the 20th best 
album of 2006.
During Tuesday night's show, Diesel was sparsely filled 
with college- and high school-age fans who were somewhat 
thrown off by the nightclub atmosphere. The stage was 
about five feet high, separating the band from the audience 
below, which left fans struggling to connect with the energy. 
Also, the PA speakers were placed on the ground, causing 
the sound to be quite muddy and drowning out a lot of the 
auxiliary instruments and vocals.
Despite the unfavorable situation, both the band and the 
fans kept the night exciting. The audience was loose and

Man Man's music being as crazy and unpredictable as it is, 
some people had trouble finding their groove in the rhythm.

enjoying the show.

Down, Heaven and Hell, and the mighty Machine Head urcerrcrrc On AphexTwina tadio station.
Down. Blending the best of Sabbath, Zeppelin, and 
early '80s thrash  with a dollop of southern rock for 
good measure  Down has been in my consciousness 
since '95 brought us Nola (for their hometown of New 
Orleans). For some, Down was the ultimate supergroup, 
featuring Phil Anselmo of Pantera, Pepper Keenan 
of C.O.C., and Kirk Windstein of Crowbar  and a 
little Bower Power on drums. Like the Loch Ness 
monster, sightings were few and far between, though 
breathlessly reported nonetheless. With Pantera just 
then entering its peak, short tours of the South were 
Down's only options for concerts. Until 2002 brought 
us Down II and a gig on the second stage at Ozzfest
 the only way you would have seen the band live 
was on a bootleg. That album, II, was less of a bulldozer 
than Nola, delving instead into the Zeppelin side of the 
group's collective brain.
I loved it, though the underground essence of Nola 
wasn't there. In actuality, Nola was first released as a 
bootleg of sorts, a three-song demo that the individual 
band members would trade with fans after their shows, 
without even letting on that this underground band was 
in fact them. When band members received their own 
tapes back in trade from around the world after having 
been dubbed (remember cassettes?) many times over, 
they knew it was time to release a full album.
After n, Phil went on to another of his projects,
Superjoint Ritual, while all the others returned to their 
respective bands. But the mystique that surrounds 
Down only grew with its absence, as did the demand for 
another album and tour. In interviews, the guys could 
only shrug their shoulders when asked about another 
album, which each of them claimed he would love to do 
eventually. That day has arrived.
With ZZJ underway, the band has hit the road in support 
of Heaven and Hell (read: Black Sabbath with Dio) and 
Megadeth. The tour opened this month in Vancouver, 
and the was city abuzz with expectations. As Ive 
written before, Vancouver has developed a reputation 
as a metal town, making it a worthy location for Ronnie 
James Dio to reunite with Sabbath after 15 years. Truth 
be told, they.put on a stellar set, which consisted solely 
of songs from Dio's three albums: The Mob Rules, 
Dehumanizer, and of course Heaven and Hell, a name 
the band took on for the tour so as to not confuse fans 
with the Ozzy version. Dios voice was in great shape, 
and deep cuts like "The Sign of The Southern Cross 
and "Lady Evil" stood well beside classics like "Neon 
Knights and The Mob Rules. Megadeth was tight as 
well, playing some new tracks of what will surely lead 
the thrash revival of this years crop of albums. But the 
night belonged to Down.
Opening at around 7:30p.m., the band played a half-hour 
set that blew me away. Announcing with pride that this 
was Down's first time in Canada, Phil was, in a word, 
phenomenal. A 40-year-old bouncing around the stage 
like a man half his age, Anselmo was possessed and I 
felt it. By the time the band hit "Bury Me In Smoke," I 
could have left the arena and called it a night. Down is 
back, folks.
When Heaven and Hell begins its U.S. run later this 
year, Machine Head will take the spot of Down on
the bill. Some of you may remember my review of the 
band's last album, Through The Ashes of Empires, as 
being both a return to form and a masterpiece. Well, 
Machine Heads latest, The Blackening trumps, even 
that. The epic 10-minute songs are there. The weird 
tempo changes that one wouldn't expect with thrash 
ar6 there. On The Blackening, Dave McClain brings his 
drumming to another level. Just as on TTAOE, the Rush 
influence is apparent, and it seems that McClain has 
taken some cues from Rush drummer Neil Peart. The 
intro to "Slanderous, for example, could have been on 
2112 well, at least the first five seconds of it.
Then begins the bombing campaign: "A Farewell to 
Arms (not Kings) is a moody 10-minute ride that lulls 
its listener into a false sense of quiet, offering clean, 
softer vocals which give way to a hardcore stomp. Now
I Lay Thee Down is a modern metal classic, without 
sounding like nu metal. Overall, this is an evolution 
from the bands debut, Burn My Eyes (way back when), 
a growth that makes sense in retrospect. Having 
experimented with its sound in the past, Machine 
Head has produced an album that, coupled with its last, 
shows a band that is fearlessly confident, able to fiddle 
with its trademark sound  and get it right.
Until next week,

Aphex Twin, artist alias of Richard D. James, is arguably the most 
widely known Intelligent Dance Music (IDM) musician; hes made 
popular the form of electronic music that incorporates blips and 
beeps. Despite his notoriety among artists who are stereotyped 
as being the dudes wearing hoodies making beats in their moms 
basement," he gets away with some of the ridiculous demands and 
actions typically attributed to a rock star. Lets take a look:
 First off, his name. The reason his alias is Aphex Twin is because 
he had a brother, named Richard James (no D.), who was stillborn. 
The cover of his Girl/Boy EP features what appears to be his grave
 actually, its his brothers.
 Rock stars sometimes destroy their guitars  James once 
ended a live show by chopping up a live microphone in a blender.
 Ridiculous demands? Hes all over that, too  at the height 
of his popularity in the late 90s, he was tired of being constantly 
interviewed, so he stipulated that all future interviews would have to 
be conducted in a helicopter. After too many were still happening, he 
started requiring that he be flying the.helicopter at the time  with no 
pilots license. One or two still happened, with him flying.
 Rockers buy wack shit  he has lived in a converted old bank 
that he purchased, and is known to own and drive around a surplus 
British army tank.
 If its rock and roll to not care what others think of you, hes set 
there. When Madonna asked him to remix a song of hers, he sent 
back a tape of a track he hadnt released yet, calling it a remix.
 Hes probably one of the most narcissistic guys ever, and 
certainly one of the most in the usually faceless electronic music 
scene. Most of his videos, especially the most popular ones, feature 
nearly every actor with his face instead of their own; in Come
To Daddy, he is a bunch of children, in Windowlicker, he plays 
stereotypical rap video chicks, and in Donkey Rhubarb, he lends 
his face to many multicolored bears.
Overall, Richard D. James is a character not only known for his 
terrific music-making ability. His popularity can also be attributed to 
the fact that journalists absolutely love him (and the extensive amount 
of material he can provide for them). James is way more of a rock 
star than the lightweights of today.

Mario meets the military
Lecturer explains the pros and cons of video war games
Last Thursday, science and technology scholar Sharon 
Ghamari-Tabrizi gave a lecture titled "What is it Now? An 
Ethnographic Study of Defense Simulations-in-the-Making," 
which explored the social implications of video .war games.
Ghamari-Tabrizi spent 2003 through 2005 researching defense 
simulations that have served as recruiting and training 
tools for the armed services. With a grant from the National 
Science Foundation, Ghamari-Tabrizi spent several months at 
multiple sites throughout the country where the military was 
collaborating with the entertainment industry.
It may seem strange for the military to be developing video 
games, but the program has been very successful. America's 
Army, a first-person shooter computer game, is the brainchild 
of West Point economics professor Colonel Casey Wardynski, 
who believed that a game would help with recruiting. With 8.2 
million registered players, the game has proven to be popular. 
According to "The Potential of Americas Army the Video 
Game as Civilian-Military Public Sphere, a masters thesis 
by MIT graduate Zhan Li, this success, along with America's 
Armys realistic presentation of Army uniforms, weapons, and 
missions, led it and similar games to be used in training.
The convergence of media and training simulators is not new. 
Airlines ha've used simulators for years to train pilots. 
Additionally, the Marine Corps used a modified version of the
 video game Doom II, called Marine Doom, to train recruits 
in 1996. One of the reasons that video games are valuable 
to training sessions is that they are thought to increase a
soldier's willingness to fire his weapon, according U.S. Army 
Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman, author of On Killing: The 
Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society..
America's Army is not the only game developed by the military 
that has been commercially released. Full Spectrum 
Warrior, a creation of the Institute for Creative Technologies,'is 
a squad-based tactical action game. Full Spectrum Command 
is a training program for higher-level officers. Real War, 
the commercial release of a real-time strategy game, was 
developed by the military for strategic training. According to 
The Washington Times, the CIA is also reportedly developing a 
game to train analysts, though without plans for a commercial 
release. Each of these non-traditional training vehicles aims 
to enhance officers' decision-making abilities. Terrorist 
organizations such as Hamas and al-Qaeda also have their own 
games.
The goal of these games is to advance the state of immersive 
training simulation. Despite the militarys best efforts, 
Ghamari-Tabrizi concluded that simulations cannot possibly 
replicate the exact environments that exist on the battlefield. 
Overtraining may actually be dangerous because it can lead to 
complacency and overconfidence, she added.
Ghamari-Tabrizi also brought up an example of how media 
convergence affects soldiers after deployment. Soldiers 
assigned to convoy duty, whom Ghamari-Tabrizi admits were 
not exactly A students in high school, have reported having a 
hard time thumbing through their manuals when under fire. To

Mellon community

today's society.
solve this problem, the army has rolled out an electronic 
version of its manual on a Gameboy-like device, which is easier 
for many Generation X and Y soldiers to navigate.
Video games, working by desensitization, are now being 
utilized as a form of therapy for troops coming home who suffer 
from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Simulations find fidelity in part because of our cultural 
experience with technology," Ghamari-Tabrizi explained.
The only way for the games' visual accuracy to be effective 
is to offer a compelling experience to their players; even 
technology is no substitute for authenticity.
Ghamari-Tabrizi said, The trainees inner experience was key 
over the razzle-dazzle of graphics. "

Dave Copelands Blood & Volume
Former Pittsburgh reporter exposes New Yorks Israeli Mafia
Dave Copeland, a former Pittsburgh news reporter, has just 
come out with his first book, Blood & Volume: Inside New 
Yorks Israeli Mafia. This past week, Copeland returned to 
Pittsburgh to appear at book signings. The book follows Ron 
Gonen, an ex-member of the Israeli Mafia from the 1980s, while 
explaining the story of the gangs run. It is a work of creative 
nonfiction, nonfiction that reads like a novel.
Copeland, as stated on his website, is a 2006 graduate of 
Goucher Colleges creative nonfiction MFA program.
Copeland has had a successful career as a writer and 
investigative reporter; hes appeared in such publications as 
the Wall Street Journal Online in addition to local newspaper 
The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Now, Copeland is the first 
journalist to uncover the inside story of the Israeli Mafia.
Copeland spent two years piecing together the Mafias story.
It all began when Copeland, while trying to find a freelance job 
on craigslist.org, found an ad from Gonen, who was looking 
for someone to write his story. Copelands original idea was to
 write about life inside the Witness Protection Program, which 
is why he first contacted Gonen. Eventually, Copeland said, he 
realized that life inside the program was uninteresting  and 
that its the "how you got there" part that is.
Gonen's testimony against the gang helped cause the gangs 
capture, prosecution, and downfall. Coerced into the gang by 
its leader Johnny Attias, Gonen wound up dealing cocaine, all 
the while wishing to care for his cocaine-addicted wife and 
infant daughter.
For Copeland, the process of writing creative nonfiction is 
much like piecing together a puzzle. He wants everything to 
be true and for the text to read like a novel, so even verifying 
the color of someone's shirt can be important when it comes 
to creating scene. During the research process, Copeland and 
Gonen communicated via phone and e-mail, unable to ever . 
meet in person. Copeland spent most of his time between 
Boston and New York, interviewing prosecutors and verifying 
the information he received. Anything that could not be 
verified had to be omitted from the book.
"[The] reason that I like my job [is that] whoever I'm writing 
about, they have an interesting life, and not one that Im 
interested in leading," Copeland said. I dont want to be a 
cocaine dealer.... Its interesting to talk to them, and seeing 
what life as one is really like."
As quoted on the Blood & Volume website, former Assistant 
U.S. Attorney Gary Cutler stated in 1991, "Ron Gonen is a 
despicable person.... You dont have to like Ron Gonen. But you 
do have to listen to him.
According to Copeland, the Gonen of today is a different man. 
Now hes older and wiser, he said. He has not been arrested 
since he entered the Witness Protection Program, and by all 
accounts hes a hard worker and a good father."
Despite this change in behavior, Gonen was expelled from the 
Witness Protection Program on February 8. His collaboration 
with Copeland broke the programs rule against contacting
writers and made other members of the program feel 
endangered. According to Copeland, Gonen, a non-U.S. citizen, 
is now working with an immigration attorney to see if he can 
get his working papers renewed in order to remain in the 
country. There is some question as to whether or not he will be 
deported to to Israel, though right now it is too early to tell.
Deportation could place Gonen's life in danger. As reported in 
The Jerusalem Post, Gonen's former accomplice Ran Freddy 
Efrayim was gunned down on the sidewalk close to his Tel 
Aviv apartment on February 1, a few days before Gonens 
expulsion. Police believe the "hits related to the gang's ' 
breakup picked up again since 2003, more than likely due to 
regrouping. The three murders that have occurred since that 
time, including Efrayim's, remain unsolved.
Copelands work with Blood & Volume remains unfinished. 
There is talk of adapting the book into a film, as some 
production companies are reading the novel. "Seeing this as 
a film is a long shot, Copeland said. Im used to being told 
no and rejected. I'm ready to go forward with it and see what 
happens to it." However, Copeland is still in the process of 
promoting his book. He is also considering new projects but 
has yet to decide on anything.
"My dream, per se, was to publish a book," he said. * 
"Everything else here on out is a bonus."

Giant man-eating plant terrorizes Pittsburgh
Duquesne University performs Little Shop of Horrors
if a huge, man-eating alien plant told you it would grant you 
/our hearts desire in exchange for a supply of still-warm 
corpses, would you do it? Surely, theres some annoying 
cousin, perverted coworker, or cranky boss you could bump 
jff to finally get that record deal or that hottie in your bio 
blass.
'
Thats the premise of the musical Little Shop of Horrors, 
which is playing until next Saturday at Duquesne University. 
The musical is based on the 1960 cult movie of the same 
lame by Roger Corman and features a toe-tapping score 
written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman thats half rock 
and roll and half doo-wop. The play is set in a floral shop on 
Skid Row, New York, owned by the cranky Mr. Mushnik, a 
nodern-day Fagin (think Oliver Twist) who browbeats his two 
employees, Audrey and Seymour. Audrey, a platinum blond 
with a voice like an anime character born in Manhattan,
las bad taste in clothes and even worse taste in boyfriends. 
Seymour is an orphan taken in by Mr. Mushnik, who allows 
jhe former to sleep under the counter and "eat good food 
ike meat loaf and water. Seymour, who comes across as a 
dutzier, dorkier version of Woody Allen, loves only two things
 weird plants and Audrey.
The show opens in a graffiti-covered alley in Skid Row. Three 
ligh-school dropouts  Ronnette (Sarah Murtha), Crystal 
Dina Ghandour), and Chiffon (Brittany Mulgrew) set the
scene with the song Little Shop of Horrors. The trio serves 
as a Greek chorus throughout the musical. Each of the actors 
fully threw herself into her part, resulting in a well-done 
performance.
The curtain then rises on Mr. Mushniks Flower Shop, and 
we learn that business isnt going so well  in fact, Mr. 
Mushnik (Eric Matthews) has decided to close the shop. 
Horrified, Audrey (Laura Paterra) convinces Seymour (Nick 
Bell) to show Mr. Mushnik the "strange and interesting" plant 
he bought the week before. Seymour puts a weird Venus 
flytrap-like plant hes dubbed "Audrey II in the window, and 
customers immediately come flocking.
All goes well until Seymour discovers that Audrey IIs favorite 
food is fresh human blood, and as the plant grows, it needs 
more and more. Soon Seymour is running out of fingertips, 
and we learn that not only can Audrey II talk and move (and 
sing), its also controlling the flower shops sudden good 
fortune. Unless Seymour brings home the human bacon
 and soon  business will once again plummet.
Playing Seymour, Bell was awkward, nerdy, clinically clumsy, 
and adorable  in a word, perfect. Bell also had the best 
sense of comedy of the ensemble. The fact that he was a foot 
shorter than Audrey made them an even cuter couple. Paterra 
was brilliant as Audrey, both convincing and frightening in
her devotion to her boyfriend Orin (who she describes as a 
semi-sadist) and, later, to Seymour. Blond Matthews didn't 
exactly look the part of Mr. Mushnik, the Jewish shop owner, 
but his performance served to overshadow this discrepancy.
Joey Frollo, who played Dr. Orin Scrivello D.D.S., is introduced 
at the end of the first act as Audreys boyfriend. Frollo, 
however, was a bit too nice for a sadist. His performance 
illustrates the only major problem with Duquesne's 
production  Little Shop of Honors was a little light on the 
horrors. Audrey II, though impressively voiced by Armand 
Minotti, didn't come across as very frightening, mostly 
because the other characters reacted to its threats like they 
were in a B movie rather than with genuine fear.
Overall, Duquesnes production is a lot of fun, with a strong 
cast, great humor, and show-stopping numbers. It should 
be even better by next weekend, so if you like musicals, 
man-eating plants, or geek-power stories, hop on the bus 
downtown. But whatever you do, dont feed the plant.
Little Shop of Horrors is playing this Thursday, Friday, and 
Saturday at Duquesnes Peter Mills Theater at 8 p.m. Tickets 
are $5 for students, children, and seniors and $10 for adults.

that the silver screen has seen. 
Interestingly enough, Rounders

Art and media are traditionally thought of as separate 
spheres of interest: Artists show their work in galleries and 
advertisers create attractive ads for billboards. But the line 
between these two realms is becoming increasingly blurry, 
a trend reflected in the School of Arts curriculum  in 
particular, in a class called Making Mass Media.
"Each art student is required, at some point while theyre 
here, to make new artworks outside of the traditional 
gallery or studio axis, said Chris Sperandio, the Jill Kraus 
visiting professor of art. For Making Mass Media, Sperandio 
wanted to combine the concept of art outside the gallery 
with his own interest in the cross section between art 
and advertising. He came up with the idea of installing 
student art on billboards throughout the city In this case," 
Sperandio said, students are using an existing distribution 
system to produce messages that are unusual or contrary to 
the messages to which one is typically subjected."
It took a only single phone call for Sperandio to secure 
billboards for student use. In November 2006, he contacted 
Lamar Outdoor Advertising, a major billboard agency in 
Pittsburgh, and described his idea for creating Making 
Mass Media, a class specifically oriented toward public art. 
Lamar accepted his proposal on the spot, and by the start 
of the new term, Sperandio had acquired four 11-by-24-foot 
billboards for his students. While he had been aiming for 10 
billboards, or as many as Lamar would give, Sperandio is 
still appreciative of the companys donations. We got fewer 
billboards than we initially wanted, but they were twice the 
size, Sperandio said.
The division of billboard space thus became an object of 
discussion. Because there were only four billboards for a 
class of 10 students, the class had to decide how to compile 
the project, in addition to selecting any themes for the 
project as a whole. After multiple class discussions, the 
students decided to create a single class-effort billboard. 
The remaining three would go to the three individual 
student projects selected by a judge outside the course.
The projects logistics proved to be difficult. In addition
to taking into consideration the billboards large size, the 
students lacked any advance knowledge of where each 
billboard would be installed. As a result, students had to 
create universal billboards, accessible to everyone rather 
than targeting a specific demographic. Moreover, students 
had to consider the nature of their medium  mostly, the _  
short amount of viewing time available to each passing 
driver. The message of each effort had to be something easy 
to take in that would also impact its viewer.
The classs partnership with Lamar came with its own set 
of constraints. As a corporate identity, Lamar expected 
certain standards from the artwork, as well as the subjects 
addressed in each of the billboards. In order to accomplish 
this, the messages the artists made, although of their own 
choosing, had to reflect the corporate partners savvy in 
adopting quality art as well as being understandable by a 
large distribution network.
The challenge of creating an accessible message stimulated 
the class. Usually, artists are limited to a slice of liberal, 
middle- to upper-class, educated people as their audience, 
said Amos Levy, a senior art major. I think that artists can 
expand their scope by partnering with corporations... [to] 
communicate [with] audiences outside of the artists usual 
range.
At one point, Sperandio invited John Carson,.the head of the 
School of Art, to visit the class. Carson, who had experience 
managing artistic billboards, primarily in the UK, explained 
to the students the different ways to approach creating a 
billboard. According to his lecture, generally the weakest 
technique is to use already-completed artwork and blow it 
up to the billboards size. Instead, the premise should be to 
create a piece of art that suits the needs of the billboard and 
its function. The students used this advice to create their 
proposals for both the individual- and class-effort billboards.
Elizabeth Thomas, an associate curator at the Carnegie 
Museum of Art, was the final judge for the individual-effort 
billboards. Liz was just a natural choice, Sperandio said. 
Because Thomas specializes in the intersection of art and
its appeal to the contemporary audience, she was an ideal 
candidate to judge the students' projects.
.Splat!
Designed by senior art major Rachel Renee Stewart,
Splat!* begins with a picture of Pittsburgh from a drivers 
perspective. Stewart used Photoshop to place a butterfly in 
the center and printed 10 copies of the image. Using vivid 
reds, yellows, and greens, which provided bright contrast 
to the rest of the picture, she flung paint at each print to 
signify the butterfly's death collision. The first one I did 
turned out to be the one I liked best, but I had to try it nine 
more times to be sure, Stewart explained. I then scanned 
the completed piece to make a large digital image to send 
to Lamar.
Splat! was inspired by the audience Stewart anticipated 
for her billboard. She geared her visual piece towards an 
experience that all drivers could relate to, particularly as 
they were speeding by in their cars. I wanted to make them 
aware of the effect this everyday mode of transportation has 
on their senses," said Stewart. I focused on the windshield 
as a barrier... When something from the outside hits the 
windshield, two opposites [collide].
Drawing of Pittsburgh
An exciting, sloppy, and loving rendering of Pittsburgh, 
"Drawing of Pittsburgh only took Levy about 20 minutes 
to draw. However, his deliberation process regarding 
approach and content took about a month. Levy also created 
an alternate draft of his image, which took him about six 
hours to complete. I decided afterward that the more timeconsuming image was dead, said Levy. I want people to 
be conscious of the place they are in  Pittsburgh. I also 
want them to think about how simple drawings, ones they 
could complete, are just as interesting as polished art and 
advertisements. 
For "Drawing Of Pittsburgh," Levy searched for images 
of Pittsburgh online and in Hunt Library. He selected an

image, traced it with a Sharpie marker, and then scanned 
it. Levy used Adobe Illustrator to create a vector-based 
version of his drawing, which magnified the image while 
retaining the clarity and sharpness of his picture.
Activating Art
The product of Blake Unger Dvorchik, a senior art major, 
"Activating Art is a simple photograph of bare wooden 
planks. The planks mimic those on actual billboards, 
which lay underneath the layers of advertisements. 
There were multiple incarnations, three of them, [and] 
each one only took about two or three hours, said Unger. 
I wanted to keep it simple and clean; my billboard was 
a straight photograph with minimal color correction in 
Photoshop."
A single Post-It note is placed on the right side of the 
piece. When asked what he wanted to achieve, Unger 
responded, "In this case, interest  or, failing that, 
confusion at seeing something different on a billboard.
Snowballs from the Freezer
This piece was a group effort made by the Making Mass 
Media class, whose goal was to remind viewers of joie 
de vivie, the joy of life. Following a more traditional 
style, this final billboard went for a look that was more 
developed and slick. The effort was cleverly directed 
toward a working world through the juxtaposition of 
two things not usually found together: playgrounds 
and businessmen. In preparation, members of the class 
traveled to Salvation Army thrift stores in search of 
business suits. They then went to Schenley Park and 
took pictures of each othei playing on the playground. "A 
lot of work went into presenting the spontaneity," Levy 
joked.
In terms of process, "Snowballs from the Freezer" was 
probably the most elaborate product. The students chose 
14 pictures out of the original 125 shot at the playground, 
and then edited those photos around the playground 
setting. The photos were then merged into a shot of the
 playground, and the students selected the typography for 
the phrase "Snowballs from the Freezer."
The billboard designs all share the same core idea, which 
can be encapsulated in a single word: independence. 
Each was intended to stand as a single, cohesive piece, 
independent of a specifically targeted demographic.
The students strove to give people something to think 
about  friendly ideas to accompany drivers on the 
highways. For the students themselves, the experience 
will be something a little different. Presenting work in 
a public space is tremendous. From the raw experience 
of seeing something you made presented in a form that 
is literally as big as a house, to the exposure of having 
your work viewed by tens of thousands who might never 
otherwise see what you make," said Sperandio, "this will 
be a transformative experience for all involved.
The billboards are scheduled to be installed on April 
1, and will be erected in various locations throughout 
Pittsburgh. For further interest in the students of the 
Making Mass Media class, visit the website www. 
snowballsfromthefreezer.com for links to their personal

Design your life
James Victore visits Carnegie Mellon
His talk may have been titled Graphic Design Just Isnt That 
interesting,'' but after listening to James Victore discuss 
his hilarious and poignant experiences as a communication 
design artist, I beg to disagree. Victore grew up on a military. 
base where he often spent his afternoons drawing by himself. 
This was because his two sisters wouldn't play with him, 
Victore explained. This kind of independence, combined with 
a yearning to use art to fulfill something within himself, has 
made James Victore one of America's most innovative and 
promising graphic designers.
Victore was the first speaker in the School of Designs 
two-month lecture series which will include a range of 
presentations by artists and designers in many different fields. 
Victore was invited by visiting professor and Carnegie Mellon 
alumna Laura Vinchesi. Vinchesi used the lecture as part of 
the curriculum for her course, Politics and Activism in Design: 
Using Graphical Media as an Agent of Change.
The goal of the course is to learn about how graphical 
media has been and is used to create change, and to allow 
students to address a personal cause within the context of 
communication/graphic design," Vinchesi explained. "Victore 
i^-a good example of a designer who uses his skills to address 
issues of personal concern and interest in a public sphere."
Victores clients have ranged from The New York Times 
Magazine to a shoe polish company, yet he claims that 
his best work always contains a political message. "Those 
projects take lives of their own," Victore said. Those projects 
take intuition. Intuition is a muscle. Use it. It gets stronger.
Throughout his lecture, Victore talked to the listener like a 
good friend, often peppering his phrases with curse words 
and slang. With professors in the audience, Victore talked 
about flunking out of The School of Visual Arts in New 
York City and the boredom that is often associated with 
introductory courses in design. Throughout the entire talk, 
Victore stayed true to himself; he never censored his words 
for the university setting or his particular audience.
Such nonconformity can be seen in his art as well. Victore 
brings his version of the truth to his posters, illustrations, 
book jackets, and flyers. When asked to design a poster 
about racism and the death penalty, he created a rather 
controversial sketch using the game Hangman, tastefully 
suggestive of a racial slur. The poster has six blank lines at the 
bottom: On the third and fourth line are two letters, both G, 
and the last space contains an R. This design was simple, to 
the point, and startling. It got audience members to stop and 
think  something that Victore strives to do in all his work.
"If you can make a poster," Victore said, and people stop [and 
think]...if you can do that once, youre a success."
Victore's message is particularly inspiring in the digital age, 
Ayhen pretty much anyone can broadly publicize his or her 
opinion through vehicles such as MySpace and Facebook. 
Victore told his audience, Youre a designer  design your 
life." In other words: Use what inspires you to create your 
art, not what other people tell you to do. Though Victore's 
message conflicts with the notion that a designer should 
serve the client above all else, his words are refreshing, 
reminding artists of the importance of art that reflects the 
voice and beliefs of its creator.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon won 
first place in the singles 
category with' "Mongooses 
on a Plane," a parody of 
Snakes on a Plane.
This Saturday, the Greek community held its annual Greek 
Sing show at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Oakland. 
Competing for trophies, campus fraternities and sororities 
performed 13-minute musical scenes.
The singles division kicked off with a performance by Pi 
Kappa Alpha. Their show, Stomp the Quad, featured dance 
music and a rapper that seemed to parody The Fresh Prince of 
Bel-Air. Next up was Beta Theta Pi, performing I was getting 
some Disney, which made fun of R. Kellys Trapped in the 
Closet. The show created scandal among Disney characters, 
including Aladdin, Simba, Ariel, and Eric (Ariels prince in The 
Little Mermaid).
Sigma Alpha Epsilon followed with "Snakes on a Plane II: 
Mongooses on a Plane. Roderick McMullen, a senior humancomputer interaction major and Greek Sing chair, said that 
the idea came to them in a dream. Despite a major lack of 
preparation (the guys only rehearsed for a week), the show 
landed SAE the first place trophy, something that the Greek 
Sing chair expected. We think were easily the most talented 
group there, McMullen joked. The final singlesact was 
Theta Xis The Game, a musical performance based on Neil 
Strauss book by the same name, which chronicles the plight 
of the pick-up artist. Theta Xis version included its fair share 
of bad pick-up lines, in addition to some ribbon dancers. The 
last fight scene was well-choreographed  easily the best part 
of the show.
Following a short intermission, first up for doubles were Alphi 
Chi Omega and Sigma Tau Gamma performing Spamalot. The 
songs were upbeat and well-performed, All of the dancers had 
high energy, making Spamalot a great performance to begin 
the second act.
Next were Delta Delta Delta and Sigma Phi Epsilon with 
"Sidekicks the Musical." In this show, a group of sidekicks had 
a chance to save the day after their heroes were lured into a 
trap. The musical numbers were buoyant, and good triumphed 
in the end; the sidekicks saved the heroes, and the two worked 
together to defeat the bad guys.
Kappa Alpha Theta and Phi Kappa Theta followed with their 
rendition of The Wiz. Out of all the performances, "The Wiz

category with their 
rendition of The Wiz.
made the best out of 13 minutes, as it didnt feel like anything 
important was left out. The group had very high energy, and 
the sets and costumes were obviously the result of a lot of 
preparation.
Next, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Alpha Epsilon Pi worked 
together to perform parts of Guys and Dolls. Their version was 
performed well, but the costumes and choreography were 
unsurprising. The voice casting, however, was impressive. . 
We choose a show based on the talent we see in both houses 
were working with, said Kappa Kappa Gamma Greek Sing 
chair Cecilia Gondek.
The final doubles act was the joint effort of Delta Gamma and 
Kappa Delta Rho. They performed some of Zombie Prom, a 
musical from the 80s about a high-school romance gone awry. 
This was their second consecutive year working together, 
and the performers generated excitement and enthusiasm 
throughout the show. The costumes were creative and the 
characterization interesting; characters included a green 
zombie and a hunched-over principal with wild hair and a 
gritty voice, perfectly suited for a show with honor elements.
The night ended with a step performance by the sisters of 
Kappa Phi Lambda, followed by awards for both charity and 
performances. This year, the Greek community raised a total of 
$13,000 for Easter Seals, an organization that provides support 
for disabled individuals. For the second year in a row, Delta 
Delta Delta won an award for raising the most money, which 
was presented by a representative from Easter Seals. Kappa 
Kappa Gamma took home the Chairmans Choice award. 
Respectively, the first, second, and third places for singles 
were won by Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Beta Theta Pi, and Theta 
Xi. For doubles, first place went to Kappa Alpha Theta and 
Phi Kappa Theta, second to Delta Delta Delta and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, and third to Delta Gamma and Kappa Delta Rho.
David Chickering, the Mudge House housefellow, was a first
time judge at this year's competition. Compared to Greek 
Sings at other schools, this blew me away, he said.

You will have no desire to watch the mens NCAA tournament anymore 
now that your bracket is totally ruined. However, youll come to the 
realization that women play, too.
Despite their tasty cheesy flavor, avoid Doritos at all costs for the next, 
week. Trust me, it wont be worth the trip to the dentist.
Your little brother will get caught shoplifting. If you didn't know you had 
a little brother, its time to have a serious discussion with your parents.
You will temporarily cause a disruption in the space-time continuum 
when you utter too loudly that you dont really like the Beatles.
Massive leg cramps will prevent you from reaching the first ice cream 
truck of the season. Dont worry; Im sure that there will be another sunny, 
glorious day in Pittsburgh soon.
Now would be a good time to avoid being hit by a frozen egg.
Instead of doing work this week, there is a very good chance that you 
will spend all your time watching Scrubs on DVD instead. Your grades 
will suffer, but it will probably be a better use of your time anyway.
The planets' alignment this week will drive you to greatness. 
Unfortunately, your desire to sleep in and scratch yourself is far more 
powerful.
Beware of the friendly-looking duck you encounter by the pond. He 
may seem great, but hell break your heart when he never calls you 
back.
This would be a good time to stop taking advice from billboards. Their 
large font may seem convincing, but how can you trust something that 
doesnt cite Its sources?
This week you will say the funniest thing you have ever said. Enjoy the 
moment because it will only be downhill from here.
After years of speculation, your printer will finally run away with your 
scanner, both never to be seen again.

Friend Opportunity
Your new best friends in indie rock
San Francisco-by-way-of-Oakland 
indie rock trio Deerhoof brings us 
yet another musical masterpiece 
with Friend Opportunity, the 
bands eighth album. In keeping 
with its album-a-year work ethic,
Deerhoof began recording in 2006 
and released the album at the 
end of January 2007, a feat almost 
inconceivable given the calculated 
whimsy and neoclassical grandeur 
that characterizes each distinct 
track. Producing a sound different
from the groups.previous works, Courtesy of Four Paws Media
Friend Opportunity contributes to the indie-music 
repartee of accessible lo-fi rock anthems and holds its own against the 
band's shockingly well-received 2006 release, The Runners Four.
Standout tracks such as "+81 which leaked prior to the album's 
release  feature a chorus of "choo choo choo choo beep beep so sugary 
sweet that-the band's official website used it as the tagline. Another such 
song, "Kidz Are So Small," striking in its simplistic chant ("If I were man 
and you a dog, Id throw a stick for you), sounds like it could have been 
tapped out on a jungle gym by a trio of preschoolers. "Matchbook Seeks 
Maniac, featuring melodic crooning and bombastic guitar riffs, contrasts 
with the rest of the tracks, which helps to create a truly diverse indie-rock 
album. More often in Friend Opportunity than in Deerhoof's prior releases, 
lead singer Satomi Matsuzaki opts to sing rather than scream, and her 
unending vocal range plays nicely with the multilayer guitar, bass, and 
drum tracks.
Over the band's 13-year history, marked by member losses and gains 
(most recently the departure of guitarist Chris Cohen, who left the band 
to focus on his side project The Curtains), Deerhoof's sound has evolved 
from its angular art-noise beginnings into a more harmonious cocktail of 
sing-along pop melodies. These recent tracks have scored attention from 
even the most critical listeners, including the writers at online music 
magazine Pitchfork Media, who praised the new album for its delightful 
novelty. Through Friend Opportunity, Deerhoof has made a name for itself 
in the esoteric indie-musician community and the far-reaching fanbase 
that its unique sound has attracted. This album is certainly the bands 
best opportunity to acquire new friends and new fans.

Legendary filmmaker John Waters spoke to students and faculty in 
McConomy Auditorium last night. Waters, who is also a writer and 
photographer, has spent much of his career shocking audiences 
by introducing provocative ideas of drugs, sexuality, and social 
commentary in his work. Check out www.thetartan.org/pillbox on
