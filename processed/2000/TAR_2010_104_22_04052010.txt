Census forms to be distributed across campus
ERIN BURNS
Junior Staffwriter
The director of the United 
States Census, Robert Groves, 
gave a lecture at Carnegie Mel
lon on Thursday, March 25. 
The lecture took place a week 
and a half before the census 
forms were to be distributed 
throughout campus dorms 
on April 6. This continued a 
series of campus-wide initia
tives to encourage census re
sponse, including a freshman 
seminar on the census taught 
by statistics professor Stephen 
Fienberg.
Groves lecture, titled A 
Society Measuring Itself: 
Census 2000 focused largely 
on the bureaus current ad 
campaigns, specifically high
lighting the attempt to reach 
a diverse audience. Groves ex
plained, There are very few 
products where your target 
audience is everyone in the 
country. The 2000 Census 
was the first where paid ad
vertising was used. It was also 
the first year with a recorded 
increase in response rate be
tween censuses since 1960. In 
2010, the bureau invested in 
advertisements targeting spe
cific groups in the U.S., most 
notably with ads in Spanish.
Students rank among the 
more difficult groups to count. 
Most current undergraduate 
students lived at home during 
the 2000 census, and many 
are confused as to where they 
should be counted in 2010. 
All students at Carnegie Mel
lon will have the opportunity 
to be counted within Pitts
burghs distribution of the 
census. Dorm students will
receive their forms from and 
return them to to their resi
dent assistants. Groves joked 
that while the student form 
is different from those sent to 
the majority of Americans, it 
is very similar to the one used 
in prisons. He noted, however, 
that off-campus students have 
lower response rates than do 
their dorm counterparts.
Senior mechanical engi
neering student Kay Csuri sent 
her form in before the April 1 
non-dorm deadline. I think 
it is our civic duty and I like 
the idea that I am going to be 
counted.
Many universities 
have organized 
programs 
to in
crease 
knowl
edge of 
the cen
sus pro
cess and to 
increase stu
dent response 
rates. Colleges 
across Boston 
have started a 
cross-collegiate 
competition aimed 
at having the high
est census response 
rate.
Carnegie Mellon 
held its freshman semi
nar focused On the census 
for the first time this year. 
Fienberg believes the course 
is especially interesting be
cause we get to read and hear 
about what is happening in the 
census  in the field nation
ally, locally, and on campus
 and we get to combine this 
with history, action projects,
and technical details about 
statistical issues. Students in 
the course not only got to meet 
the current bureau director, 
but also met Barbara Everitt 
Bryant and Kenneth Prewitt, 
the directors from 1990 and 
2000, respectively.
Pittsburgh has organized 
numerous events, includ
ing March to the Mailbox, 
an event where community 
members walk across Pitts
burgh encouraging those in 
low-response areas 
to return
their forms. For every 1 per
cent increase in forms mailed 
back, the United States saves 
about $85 million.
This fiscal year, the 2010 
Census budget came in around 
$7.2 billion. However, if every
one in the country returned, 
their forms, the government 
would save about $1.5 
billion. Mail
ing the
form costs about 42 cents, 
minimal in comparison to the 
$60 it would cost to send a 
census employee to a citizens

Carnegie Mellon cricket team members 
honor service of fallen police officers

Saturdays cricket match began with a presentation of awards honoring the service of three fallen officers.
DYLAN MORI
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons cricket 
team hosted a benefit match 
last Saturday at noon for three 
Pittsburgh police officers who 
lost their lives last year.
The three officers, Eric G. 
Kelly, Stephen J. Mayhle, and 
Paul J. Sciullo II, lost their lives 
in April 2009 while answering 
a domestic call in the Stanton 
Heights-neighborhood. It was 
the first on-duty death of Pitts
burgh officers in 18 years.
All three of the officers 
loved baseball and had been 
interested in cricket due to the 
similarities between the two 
sports. With this in mind, the 
police department approached 
Carnegie Mellons cricket team 
to play the memorial match. 
The team members were deep
ly affected and determined to 
do something to help honor

The current chair of Staff 
Council stepped down last 
Wednesday. In an e-mail to 
Staff Council representatives, 
Joseph Pastorik, the director 
of building operations and fa
cilities for the Tepper School 
of Business, announced he 
would be ending his term as 
chair, as well as leaving the 
university.
Pastorik announced his 
decision to step down with
out prior notice, simply cit
ing that his need to care for 
a family member has become 
acute, and the decision to 
create a work/life balance 
has become increasingly dif
ficult. He also praised Staff 
Councils current leadership, 
including Vice Chair Joe Imbimbo and past chair Jennifer
Cox.
Staff Council has existed 
for nearly a decade at Carne
gie Mellon. It was established 
to provide a representative 
body and voice to advocate 
the issues of staff members 
across the university.
As stated in the groups 
constitution, its chief purpose 
is to examine matters related 
to all staff, and to formulate 
recommendations as well 
as representing all persons 
holding full or part time staff 
appointments. Staff Council 
is for the staff what student 
government is for students at 
Carnegie Mellon.
The Tartan spoke with 
Cox, the financial manager 
for the Office of the Dean of 
Student Affairs and the past 
chair of Staff Council.

Port Authority Transit Development Plan re-routes city bus lines
GREG HANNEMAN
Copy Manager
The first phase of the Port 
Authoritys Transit Develop
ment Plan took effect yes
terday, as approximately 50 
Allegheny County bus routes 
were re-numbered, re-routed, 
or discontinued.
Sundays changes repre
sented the first service modi
fications carried out under 
the authoritys new develop
ment plan, the result of an 
18-month study announced in 
June 2007. The study included 
public open houses and hear
ings, and it garnered more 
than 5000 comments from 
residents.
Port Authority CEO Ste
phen Bland said in a February 
Rider Report that the author
ity hadnt experienced such an 
overhaul in about 50 years, but 
that it was required now for a
variety of reasons. Riders and 
leaders repeatedly have called 
for better transit options  
something more convenient, 
efficient, and easier to under
stand, he stated. The state 
funding formula adopted two 
years ago requires us to pursue 
a more efficient system.
Several routes passing near 
the Carnegie Mellon campus 
were affected by Sundays re
alignment.
The popular 59U route, 
previously serving the SouthSide Works at one end and the 
Waterfront at the other, has 
been split into a separate route 
for each endpoint. A new 75 
bus now runs between Bakery 
Square in East Liberty and the 
SouthSide Works via Fifth Av
enue, with the closest campusarea stop at Fifth Avenue and 
Craig Street. Meanwhile, the 
existing 61D on Forbes Avenue 
has been re-routed to serve
the Waterfront, with the cam
pus stops remaining the same. 
Riders from north of campus 
can also reach the Waterfront 
via the new 64 route, which 
replaces the 64A and travels 
from Lawrenceville via Bloom
field, Friendship, Shadyside, 
and Squirrel Hill.
Airport service from Car
negie Mellon is still provided 
by the 28X, but its new route 
no longer passes through Rob
inson Town Center. Instead, 
those coming from Oakland 
can ridel the G2, labeled 
West Busway-Oakland, to 
the shopping center.
Despite the numerous 
changes across the county, 
Bland stressed that the Transit 
Development Plan was a sim
plification and not a reduction 
in service.
Were simply matching.
See BUSES, A3
Michael Kahn/Forum Editor
The Port Authority has adjusted many of its current lines with the goal of further developing the transit system.

Statistically 
Speaking
Balancing homework, jobs, and extracurricular ac
tivities simultaneously, the average Carnegie Mellon 
student is no stranger to stress. M the school year wraps 
up and exams approach, students may find it interesting 
to learn that April is National Anxiety and Stress Aware
ness Month. With this in mind, lets set aside the text
books and take a look at the numbers concerning stress 
in the United States:
40 million
the number of American adults ages 18 and older who have an
anxiety disorder
66%
percentage of Americans who would welcome 
help in dealing with stress in their lives
percentage of American workers who are unhappy in their current 
job environment due to work-related stress
percentage of Americans who leave their jobs due to stress

Warsaw correspondent of 
The Economist magazine. 
Since then, she has worked 
as a columnist at several Brit
ish newspapers and as the

Gregg Hal! (Porter 100)
Solomon Benatar will 
talk about the ever-changing 
global financial crisis and 
how it reveals both the state 
of the fragile global economy 
as well as major long-term 
implications of the economy 
being unfair for global health 
and human flourishing.
According to Benatar, it 
is a critical time in world his
tory, as our relationship to 
understanding and working 
to counteract the negative 
effects of modern life on cli
mate change and our natural 
environment is more impor
tant than ever. If we want to 
have a large impact regarding 
global health and environ
mental security, it is neces
sary that we become more 
deeply introspective about 
our value system and also 
reconsider what needs to be 
done to ensure long-lasting 
human flourishing.
One proposed theory says 
that belief in endless econom
ic growth and an emphasis 
on a completely medicalized 
approach to health needs 
must be replaced by a vision 
of healthy human life that is 
achievable and sustainable 
for more of the worlds popu
lation.
Benatar is a professor 
emeritus of medicine and

Professors work inspires, influences
The Comet and the Tornado Amy Burkert to succeed Nair
A book authored by Car
negie Mellon professor Don 
Marinelli featuring the late 
Randy Pausch has been re
leased. Called The Comet 
and the Tornado, it is an ac
count of the authors time 
working with Pausch, the 
inspiring Carnegie Mellon 
computer science professor 
and co-author of The Last Lec
ture. Marinelli, the current 
executive producer of the 
Entertainment Technology 
Center (ETC), writes of his 
personal experiences during 
his time as an assistant head 
of the drama department at 
Carnegie Mellon and after 
he helped to co-found the 
ETC with Pausch. The books 
events focus on the time that 
he and Pausch worked to
gether in the ETC.
The roots of the books 
title stem from a nickname  
a tornado  Pausch called 
Marinelli during the Last 
Lecture he gave at Carnegie 
Mellon, and Marinelli decid
ed that the comet was an 
appropriate description for 
Paushs life and work.
A unique feature of the 
book is that each copy comes 
with a synthetic interview, 
created by the ETC and the 
computer science depart
ment, where the reader is 
able to hold a conversation 
with a person as if they were 
available in real time.
The Carnegie Mellon 
bookstore is presenting a 
reading and book signing ses
sion with Marinelli on April
16, from noon to 2 p.m. in the 
University Center.
On August 1, Amy Burkert 
will transition from her cur
rent positions in the Mellon 
College of Sciences to the vice 
provost for education.
Burkerts work at Carnegie 
Mellon has been significant, 
including accomplishments 
in the biological science field 
and in helping to create inter
disciplinary programs such as 
the Science and Humanities 
Scholars program and the 
Bachelor of Science and Arts. 
She has also had a role in cre
ating the major in biological 
sciences and psychology, a 
biomedical engineering mi
nor for non-engineering stu
dents, and a minor in health 
care policy and management. 
Burkert currently serves as 
assistant dean for the Health 
Professions Program and Ed
ucational Initiatives and as a 
professor in the department 
of biological sciences.
Other initiatives have 
included working with others 
to create the first-year course 
Eureka, which combines 
knowledge and skills in 
biology, chemistry, physics, 
and mathematical sciences. 
She was a key participant 
in developing the course 
Biotechnology Impacting 
Our Selves, Societies, and 
Spheres.
Burkert will be succeeding 
Indira Nair, a professor in en
gineering and public policy, 
who is retiring after having 
worked at Carnegie Mellon 
for the past 32 years.

Cricket Credits 2010 remembers the 
sacrifices of Pittsburgh police officers
Jessica Sochol/Photo Staff
CRICKET, from A1
the sacrifices of those 
individuals. With the 
help of CIT Public Re
lations Director Chriss 
Swaney, who organized the 
ceremony, they put on an exhi
bition cricket match honoring 
the fallen officers.
[The Pittsburgh police] 
keep our city safe, said Sagar Shah, a junior electri
cal and computer engi
neering major and the 
president of the Crick
et Club. We feel re
ally safe when we see 
a policeman standing 
in the corner, patrol
ling the area, and it 
is because of their 
efforts that the cam
pus community is a 
much more safe and 
fun place to be. 
Shah has been 
impressed by the 
service of the of
ficers, especially in 
comparison to col
lege campuses in 
India, where many 
of the teams mem
bers are originally 
from.
Last Saturdays 
match began with 
a bagpipe gala by 
sponsored per
former Patrick 
Regan, followed 
by a presentation 
of awards to both 
Pittsburgh deputy
George Sugar and University Police of
ficer Paul Helffrich to thank them for 
their service.
We had never anticipated the 
amount of support, said Sugar as he ac
cepted his plaque. He spoke briefly on 
the police forces dedication to commu
nity and family that remains unwavering 
despite the risks. Every time they put 
on that badge and walk out that door, it 
may be the last time.
As further tribute to the officers, eight 
of the cricket team members released 
eight doves symbolizing peace. Regan 
followed the release with a bagpipe ren
dition of Amazing Grace.
After this, the game began. The team 
split into two groups and played a modi
fied version of a typical cricket match, 
without padding and with the standard 
leather ball replaced with a dpct-taped 
tennis ball.
Cricket has similar mechanics to 
baseball, but with notable differences. 
Most of the action takes place on a strip 
of field called the pitch. There are two 
batsmen at opposite sides of the pitch, 
and the pitcher (known as the bowler) 
throws the ball toward one of the bats
men from the opposite side of the pitch. 
The bowlers goal is to knock over the 
wickets, in this game represented by a 
stack of plastic crates, to get the batsman 
out. When the ball is hit, the fieldsmen 
 everyone else on the bowlers team  
try to catch the ball to knock over the op
ponents wickets, while the two batsmen 
switch sides, called a run, and score the 
batting jteam points.
At the matchs conclusion, Police 
Chief Nathan E. Harper arrived to ac
cept three plaques officially honoring 
the fallen officers. Its been a struggling 
year, Harper said. At every [police] 
event, we have to deal with challenges. 
Its been a humbling experience when 
you see groups pull together.
After the exhibition, the Carnegie 
Mellon team departed to Wooster Col
lege, where they competed in a four-day 
tournament. The tournament consisted 
of three competing teams from colleges 
and universities. The Carnegie Mellon 
team returned victorious, winning all of 
their matches.

2010 census counts 
begin across nation
CENSUS, from A1
door  something the bu
reau is required to do when 
individuals fail to respond. 
The money saved is sent back 
to the U.S. Treasury and, as 
Groves highlighted, mailing 
in your form means youve 
done your own little part in 
attacking the deficit.
This year, the bureau is 
sending replacement forms 
during the first weeks of 
April, hoping to increase re
sponse rates of those who 
might have lost or misplaced
their original census forms. 
One concern for this .years 
census, however, is that there 
are currently a larger number 
of vacant homes in the U.S. 
than in 2000, due to the eco
nomic recession.
Currently, Carnegie Mellons response rate is at about 
56 percent, about even with 
the nations 54 percent.
Current response rates, 
complete census information, 
and directions for submitting 
the census can be found on 
the official government web
site: www.2010census.gov.
Imbimbo to replace Pastorik 
as current Staff Council chair
COUNCIL, from A1
While she recognized Pastoriks departure as surpris
ing, she is confident that Staff 
Council will work through 
this transition. Cox believes 
that the leadership change 
will pass without turmoil, but 
she did wish that the campus 
could be more aware of Staff 
Council. I dont think people 
on campus realize that we are 
here to advocate for them, 
she said.
Just last year, with Cox at 
the helm, Staff Council adopt
ed a new slogan: Advocacy. 
Involvement. Impact. Yet 
many on campus may not re
alize that Staff Council spon
sors a number of prominent 
campus activities, including 
Kennywood Day, Take your 
Sons and Daughters to Work 
Day, a food drive, and Presi
dents Forums. Most impor
tantly, we are here to address 
concerns of staff, Cox said.
In several recent Forum ar
ticles, The Tartan has focused 
on the lack of involvement 
and awareness from students 
about what student govern
ment actually does, and there 
are similar concerns with 
Staff Council. While currently 
down to six vacant seats, Cox 
believes part of the problem 
is that many staff members 
are unaware of Staff Council, 
or, if they are aware, they are 
unsure of what we do.
She also said some super
visors are less supportive of 
staff involvement on council. 
To address this, Staff Council 
members have been reach
ing out to deans and vice 
presidents to promote their 
divisions participation in ad
dressing the needs of staff 
across the university  needs 
that do exist and are not with
out controversy.
Earlier this academic 
year, staff on a monthly pay 
schedule were informed that 
they would be switched to bi
weekly pay. This change was 
mandatory, and staff were in
formed that in December 2009 
they would not be paid the full 
monthly amount. Many in
dividuals disagreed with the 
adjustment, arguing that the 
timing was unfair: Right be
fore the holiday season, staff 
would receive approximately 
half of their expected pay, 
with the remainder not being 
distributed until April.
With Coxs work as finan
cial manager for Student 
Affairs, she was actively in
volved in the issue and be
lieves that the administration 
in the end was understand
ing of the hardship it caused, 
and responded very well with 
a supplement to the income of 
the affected staff members.
Staff Council has also re
cently dealt with the reduced 
budget cuts around campus, 
especially concerning invol
untary staff terminations over 
the past two years. Imbimbo, 
a principal software engi
neer in Computing Services 
and the current vice chair of 
Staff Council, pointed to Staff 
Councils work allowing debit 
card use in conjunction with 
staff flex accounts.
He stated that this would
allow staff to use the card ... 
to pay for over-the-counter 
drugs, prescription drugs, and 
co-pays, something many 
staff members have asked for.
Imbimbo also confirmed 
that he has now assumed the 
position of chair, a job he will 
continue for the remainder 
of Pastoriks term plus next 
years term, for which he was 
slated to serve as chair.
From Pastoriks e-mail to 
the staff, it was clear his de
cision was not taken lightly, 
saying he would surely miss 
the CMU staff, but remain 
inspired by [the staffs] dem
onstrated commitment to 
higher education, particularly 
through the mission of Staff 
Council.
His trust is now in Imbim

Last week, Joseph Pastorik stepped down as chair of Staff Council while 
simultaneously leaving the university. Pastorik will be replaced by Joe 
Imbimbo, current vice chair of Staff Council.
BUSES, from A1
demand with service, he said. 
The number of weekday bus 
trips, for example, will increase 
by 6 percent even though the 
number of overall routes will 
drop from 186 to 122.
While many have ex
pressed concern over 
the changes, specifi
cally the removal of 
the the 59U route, 
students have gener
ally responded posi
tively to the re-rout
ing of lines.
I think this could 
be a very positive 
change, said Peter 
Versteeg, a doctoral 
candidate in the en
gineering and public 
policy department.
Bus systems 
sometimes arent 
used as much as 
they should be.
Transit systems 
cost the city a lot of 
money, so citizens 
should really be 
taking advantage 
of the bus lines. I 
could see how it 
could be frustrat
ing and inconve
nient to change 
your route, but in 
general, I think it 
can only be a good 
thing.
After this weeks route 
changes, the Transit Develop
ment Plan calls for several more 
rounds of service updates over 
the next two years.
Among the planned addi
tions is a new Rapid Bus service 
 similar to concepts in place in 
Boston, Los Angeles, and Cleve
land  featuring fewer stops and 
simpler routes for faster travel. 
Rapid Bus is set to be phased 
in on the 28X, 61 series, and 71 
series routes, but a statement 
by the Port Authority said that
conversion to the system would 
depend on funding and planning 
coordination with the Pittsburgh 
city government.
In the meantime, campusarea riders will see an increase 
in the frequency of 61A and 61B 
buses.
For a full list of Sundays
service changes and an 
overall picture of the post-Transit 
Development Plan bus routes, see 
the Port Authoritys website at 
www. porta u thori ty. org/PAAC/ 
Customerlnfo/RouteChanges/ 
tabid/512/Defa ult. aspx.
The website also allows visi
tors to sign up for e-mail alerts 
for when specific routes change 
in the future.
A second round of transpor
tation changes from the Port Au

Depression: A chemical imbalance can upset a normal lifestyle
PHILIP ORBETA
Junior Staffwriter
In most cultures, includ
ing our own, we are raised to 
think of depression as a taboo 
topic. It is not difficult to see 
why this is the case, consid
ering the number of different 
preconceptions people have 
about the disease.
From the notion that hav
ing depression is just a nor
mal part of life to the notion 
that the ability to overcome 
depression is a measurement 
of willpower, it is safe to say 
that there are misconceptions 
about the condition, making it 
difficult for people to get a real 
sense of the illness.
Because of this, it may not 
be hard to believe that the 
majority of people with de
pression never seek help, even 
though research has shown 
that most people with the con
dition will respond to treat
ment.
As convenient as it is for 
most people to neglect depres
sion, it truly is a severe illness 
and, like any other illness, has 
significant negative effects on 
a persons family and friends, 
and the people he or she might 
encounter throughout his or 
her daily life.
Additionally, depression af
fects the quality of a persons 
work and may even lead to the 
deterioration of the persons 
overall health.
So what exactly is depres
sion? Before we attempt to an
swer this, it may be important 
to first point out that the word 
depression has two different
meanings. The website www. 
healthcentral.com defines de
pression as a state in which a 
person has a low mood and 
generally lacks the will to en
gage in activity.
According to The Diagnostic 
and. Statistical Manual of Men
tal Disorders (DSM), someone 
who is depressed will experi
ence feelings of sadness, help
lessness, and hopelessness, 
but will return to a neutral 
state with time and support.
Depression, however, can 
also be used as a more gen
eral term for Major Depressive 
Disorder, a mental disorder in 
which a person constantly ex
periences an all-encompassing 
low mood accompanied by 
low self-esteem and a loss of 
interest in activities they usu
ally enjoy. This type of depres
sion can seriously change a 
persons lifestyle.
It is also known as clini
cal depression, major depres
sion, unipolar depression, or 
unipolar disorder. This form 
of depression is more than just 
a state of mind; rather, it is 
the result of physical changes 
in the brain, connected to an 
imbalance of one or more dif
ferent types of neurotransmit
ters, chemicals that carry sig
nals throughout the brain and 
the nervous system.
Someone who has major 
depression is suffering from 
more than just the blues and 
may not be able to overcome 
the problem on their own. They 
may dismiss their condition as 
nothing serious, but this form

Dungeons and Dragons 
(D&D) is a popular pen-andpaper role-playing game. Part 
of the reason people enjoy 
playing it as much as they do 
is that it leaves almost every
thing to the imagination.
The game is not really 
played out on the table in front 
of you, but in your minds eye, 
and this aspect, along with 
the games many rules and 
complex setup process, often 
turns away newcomers.
Many attempts have been 
made to integrate D&D with 
modern graphics, but this
causes it to lose the interac
tivity and physicality of the 
tabletop game. Fortunately, 
the students at the Enter
tainment Technology Center 
(ETC) at Carnegie Mellon 
have come up with a proof-ofconcept project that combines 
the ease of use of a computer 
game with the pen-and-paper 
charm of D&D.
Called Surfacescapes, this 
project is run by Whitney 
Babcock-McConnell, Michael 
Cole, Stephen Dewhurst, Bulut Karakaya, Dyala KattanWright, and Maokai Xiao, all 
masters students at the ETC.
Surfacescapes is a version 
of D&D that can be played on
a Microsoft Surface, a type of 
touchscreen table that can lit
erally combine a table and a 
computer.
Every ETC student is re
quired to complete a project 
in order to graduate, and this 
can either be a client project 
working for an external con
tractor or a project of the stu
dents own design.

team members were working 
on a client project for Lock

The evolution of war, by 
necessity, encouraged the 
advancement of technol
ogy. However, society has 
also changed  weapons in 
the past were created to kill 
and maim more effectively, 
but weapons of the future will 
have a more humane side.
It might seem like a para
dox  a humane weapon  
but researchers are looking 
to create weapons that will be 
able to subdue enemies effec
tively without causing perma
nent physical harm.
One such weapon being 
developed is a kind of military 
pain beam that will hopefully 
reduce civilian casualties in 
future conflicts. This has al
ready been tested on subjects 
and shown to be effective.
Pain is an unpleasant but 
necessary sensation that no
tifies the body of harm. It is a 
natural response that allows 
an organism to know when 
damage is occuring so that it 
may alter its behavior to re
duce further damage. People 
born with the inability to 
feel pain may bite their own 
tongues constantly or break 
their arms and not realize it.
The pain beam will exploit 
the bodys natural response to 
pain, which is to move away 
from the source.
The more formal term 
for the military pain beam 
is an active-denial system, 
or ADS. It works by exploit
ing pain receptors in human 
skin. According to www. 
howstuffworks.com, a beam 
of electromagnetic energy is 
sent out from something that 
looks like a satellite dish.
An article on www. wired, 
com states that the beam 
is comprised of millimeter 
waves, which have wave
lengths between X-rays and 
microwaves.
The beam moves at the 
speed of light  instanta
neously compared to modern 
weapons like bullets, missiles, 
or bombs  and acts over 
great distances. The actual 
distance is classified infor
mation, although it is known 
to work at a distance of 500 
meters.
The energy beam heats the 
skin of anyone in the path of 
the beam, and the skin ab
sorbs most of the emitted ra
diation. This causes a feeling 
of intense burning.
The beam will not be 
able to penetrate the skin far 
enough to damage internal 
organs. Experts note that 
some activities like tanning 
will have a more damaging 
effect to the body in the long 
run than an ADS. However, 
the long-term effects have not 
been extensively studied.
According to www.bbc. 
co.uk, a Reuters journalist 
volunteered to be shot by the 
beam. He described the ef
fect as similar to a blast from 
a very hot oven  too pain
ful to bear without diving for 
cover.
Because the ADS looks 
like a satellite dish, it can be 
mounted on top of military 
vehicles, including ships and 
planes. This will allow for mo
bility of the ADS, an important 
feature for any weapon.
The military currently en
visions the major use of the 
ADS as crowd control. Ac

SCHECK BRIEFS
CERN creates record particle collision Quantum mechanics keep timeCell phones may not affect driving
On March 30, the European Organization for Nuclear Re
search (CERN) made a huge leap in the field of quantum phys
ics. Using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator, 
scientists achieved energies from the collision of two protons at 
speeds nearly 3.5 times higher than previously recorded, making 
it the largest ever release of energy by a particle accelerator.
The protons were sped through CERNs 27-kilometer-long 
LHC tunnel near Geneva, reaching speeds close to light speed 
at the point of impact, over a course of almost two weeks. The 
entire process took 7 trillion electronvolts (TeVs)  the energy 
gained by one trillion electrons as they travel through a potential 
of one volt  and almost two years of research.
Researchers are hoping to use this discovery to gain greater 
insight into the creation of the universe, realize why matter has 
mass, and explore new fields of fundamental quantum physics. 
Some hope that the debris from another such collision will shed 
light on the elusive Higgs boson, the theoretical elementary par
ticle of mass. In any case, CERN hopes to soon utilize the LHCs 
full capacity 14 TeVs  in its experiments.
As CERN director Rolf Heur put it, Its a great day to be a 
particle physicist.
Currently, atomic clocks run on the cesium scale, which mea
sures the number of vibrations of a set of cesium atoms per sec
ond. There are certain inaccuracies in the measurement of the 
vibrations, so there have been suggestions to use quantum phys
ics to increase the precision of these clocks time-telling.
Two teams, one headed by Philipp Treutlein, assistant profes
sor of physics at the University of Basel, and the other by Markus 
Oberthaler, professor of physics at Heidelberg University, ma
nipulated quantum mechanics in order to improve the accuracy 
of atomic clocks. There is a quantum phase of matter called the 
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which the atoms are placed 
in multiple energy states simultaneously (known as a super
state) and then snapped permanently into one of the states af
ter their original state is measured. The inaccuracies arise when 
many trials of the experiment are done; the number of atoms in 
each energy state begins to differ in each run.
Treutleins group used a chip with a microwave pulse to make 
sure that only those atoms of the same energy state interacted. 
Oberthalers applied a magnetic field to the BEC in order to 
strengthen and weaken collisions between atoms depending on 
their states.
Although countless people have been cau
tioned about using a cell phone while driv
ing, a new study indicates that driving 
ability might not be as impaired by cell 
phone use as previously believed.
Jason Watson and David Stayer, psy
chologists at the University of Utah, 
conducted an experiment with young 
drivers (ages 18-43) and their ability to 
drive, perform simple math equations, 
and recall words while simultaneously 
talking on a phone.
The study showed that the abil
ity to perform these tasks declined dra
matically while driving. However, a number 
of subjects actually improved their performance. These people, 
called supertaskers, contradict the accepted views on attention 
and mental control, which is that doing two tasks at once lowers 
performance in each.
The cause of this anomaly, whether specific mental mecha
nisms or personal tendencies, remains unknown.

Military technology causes pain 
without harmful lasting effects
Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons
This Active-Denial System is fully functional and mobile. Tests have already been performed and show that 
subjects cannot usually last more than three seconds in the so-called "pain beam."
MILITARY, from A5
test subjects reached their 
pain thresholds in three sec
onds, and the site also noted 
that none of the subjects man
aged to stay in the beam for 
more than five seconds. This 
would be enough to make any 
crowd scatter.
The beam can penetrate 
through many objects, but not 
those made of stone or metal. 
This has prompted some to 
believe that wearing a metal 
suit may help protect soldiers 
against this beam. The United 
States Air Force has tested 
aluminum clothing, but it is 
only when absolutely no part 
of the body is exposed that 
ADS is ineffective.
While ADS may seem like 
a welcome technology to 
the military, human rights 
activists have concerns over 
the legitimacy of the claims 
concerning the technologys 
safety. The long-term health 
effects have not been fully 
studied, and in some mock 
situations in which ADS was 
tested, some subjects emerged 
with burns and blisters. A case 
of second-degree burns was
reported in one instance.
In addition, according to 
www. boston. com, having a 
weapon marked as non-lethal 
might prompt troops to use 
the weapon inappropriately, 
and in intense battle situa
tions they might become for
getful of proper procedure. 
This may mean pointing the 
beam at a crowd of people for 
more time than is necessary 
or for more time than testing 
has shown to be safe.
ADS is not the only technol
ogy being developed for nonlethal usage. Another type of 
device emits a loud, disorient
ing noise that can be used for 
crowd control. Researchers 
have also considered using 
high-tech stinkbombs and 
flashbang grenades  gre
nades that emit a bright light 
upon explosion  to remove 
people from a certain area.
Wartime will always 
prompt the development of 
weapons. It is fortunate that 
researchers are actively pro
moting the development of 
non-lethal weapons.

SURFACE, from A5
the webcomic Penny Arcade, 
Mike Krahulik, was visiting 
the group and offhandedly 
suggested that they should put 
D&D on the table.
They loved the idea, 
switched projects, and assem
bled a team to work on it.
The system has two soft
ware parts, both written in 
various Microsoft program
ming languages. One runs on
a laptop or desktop and allows 
the person running the game
 the Dungeon Master, or DM
 to control every aspect of 
the game being played.
The other part of the soft
ware runs on the Surface itself 
and allows the other players to 
interact with the game.
Players interact with the 
game through the touchscreen 
and by using special game 
pieces that represent their 
game characters. These pieces
can be identified by the Sur
face and are used to navigate 
the game world.
A useful way to visualize 
the game is to look at it as a 
board game where the board 
is constantly changing to re
flect the results of the game.
All of the dice rolling and 
computation can be done pain
lessly by the computer, though 
purists can also play through 
the game without assistance. 
Babcock-McConnell pointed
out that the team wanted to 
take away as little as possible 
from the original game. They 
did not want to take away any 
of the role playing and story
telling. They simply wanted 
to make it easier to avoid the 
tedium that such games can 
involve, including keeping 
track of the many pieces.
They also included features 
that, according to BabcockMcConnell, allow you to pull 
up the rules and allows the
game to act as a reference. 
Unfortunately, BabcockMcConnell said that there is 
no future beyond the end of 
the semester. He noted that 
the team is going to become 
fractured as they srart getting 
jobs in the industry. Also, he 
points out that we have no 
right to the Dungeons & Drag
ons intellectual property.... 
The moment we stop being 
students we would run into all 
sorts of legal trouble with the
IP.
The group also noted that 
Surfacescapes technology will 
not be put up for sale. How
ever, they will be showcasing 
their project at the Penny Ar
cade Expo this April.
The fact that surface tables 
are very expensive and can 
only be purchased by busi
nesses also reduces opportu
nities, although it is definitely 
worth keeping an eye out for 
the technology in the future.

STARTS FRIDAY APRIL 9
CHECK LOCAL LISTINGS FOR THEATRES AND SHOWTIMES.
Misconceptions about depression stop patients from seeking therapy
listed above, doctors diagnose 
depression by looking for a list 
of different symptoms.
Symptoms of depression 
vary greatly among individu
als, and they manifest in dif
ferent ways. Some of these 
symptoms include constant 
feelings of sadness, irritabil
ity, or tension, loss of energy 
or feeling tired despite lack of 
activity, a change in appetite 
or significant weight loss or 
weight gain, irregular sleep
ing patterns, and a decreased 
ability to make decisions or 
concentrate.
More emotional signs in
clude constant feelings of 
guilt, worthlessness, and 
hopelessness, and in extreme 
cases, thoughts of suicide and 
death. For anyone who may 
be experiencing one or sev
eral of these symptoms, it is 
imperative that he or she talk 
to a doctor about potentially 
suffering from depression.
There are many different 
treatments used to combat 
depression, one of which is 
antidepressants. This type of 
treatment aims to improve 
the symptoms of depression 
by targeting chemicals in the 
brain that are out of balance
and restoring them to a more 
equilibrated state.
Depending on the type 
of depression, a doctor may 
choose to use different types 
of medication. As this is the 
case, some treatments may 
take longer than others, and 
different patients may experi
ence different side effects.
Alternatively, doctors may 
suggest forms of treatment, 
such as psychotherapy (talk 
therapy) or even electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but 
only for more extreme cases. 
Ultimately, one should never 
make decisions without the 
proper consultation from a 
professional.
Although depression car
ries a negative connotation 
when viewed in the context 
of a mental disorder, the fact 
remains that it is a prevalent 
and very critical condition, 
but one that can be treated 
easily.
It is important that we 
learn to approach depression 
more intelligently, so that we 
can eradicate unrealistic no
tions and take steps to prevent 
an illness that affects such a 
vast number of people world
wide.
DEPRESSION, from A5
of depression is the form that 
is often misunderstood and 
at times underestimated. It 
may be surprising to find that
16 percent, of around 1 in 6 
Americans, consisting of men 
and women of all ages and 
coming from different kinds 
of backgrounds, have or will 
have this type of depression 
during their lifetime.
According to www. 
depression.com, depression 
is the combined result of nu
merous biological, psycholog
ical, and social factors. These 
factors include family history, 
past or existing trauma and 
stress, a pessimistic person
ality, physical conditions or 
ailments, and even the pres
ence of other psychological 
disorders.
Although some of these 
factors may appear to have a 
greater effect on an individual 
than others, depression is dif
ferent for everyone and must 
l?e dealt with on a case-bycase basis.
The signs of depression are 
numerous. Aside from gath

all of this knowledge and provides 
an additional, or possibly the only, 
reason for a student to vote for a can
didate.
We have already described in re
cent issues the lack of general student 
body interest in student government 
and the vacancies in Undergraduate 
Student Senate this year, and we at
tempted early in the election season 
to convince you that student govern
ment is in fact important and worth 
paying attention to. Whether or not 
we have succeeded in these goals, we 
will now explain our own evaluation 
of the candidates and the reasons for 
the following endorsements.
Student Body Vice 
President for Organizations: 
Aaron Gross
You might cynically say: Well, of 
course we should endorse Gross; he 
is the only candidate running for this 
position. We would not endorse him 
if we were not confident that he de
served our votes. Gross has been an 
active member of a number of clubs 
and organizations on campus, as well 
as an excellent leader for Undergrad
uate Student Senate. He is thorough, 
meticulous, and organized, and he
has a strong and compelling vision 
for the role of the VPO. Moreover, he 
is extremely personable and will be 
easily approachable for all of the var
ied student organizations that will 
benefit from his direction next year.
All of these things are evidenced 
in his long and detailed platform. 
While we believe that setting forth 
14 different platform initiatives  
many of which are large and complex 
projects in their own right  pres
ents a challenge for a candidate to 
live up to, if anyone can accomplish 
most of these projects, it is certainly 
Gross. We have complete faith that 
he is the perfect person to define the 
future for organizations at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Student Body Vice 
President for Finance: 
Eric Wu
With Robert Piston withdrawing 
from the race, we are left with two 
remaining VPF candidates to select 
from: Shanel Buchanan and Eric Wu. 
While Buchanan and Wu have both 
served on the Joint Funding Commit
tee, a major component of the role of 
the VPF, their other work differenti
ates them. Buchanans platform was 
nearly non-existent; her answers at 
the debate, while competent, were 
lacking vision; and she has not solid
ly pulled from her experience as the 
treasurer of other organizations.
On the other hand, Wus experi
ence with Student Senate as well as 
his clear vision for continuing cur
rent VPF Nara Kasbergens goals of
growing the JFC are well prepared, 
and we believe he will provide strong 
leadership for the JFC. We do ques
tion his plan to interview JFC reps as 
a part of the application process, as 
it is already difficult to find potential 
representatives. However, we are in
terested to see how he will work to 
separate the role of VPF from solely 
chair of the JFC to a larger studentadvocacy role regarding university 
finances.
Student Body President
Finally, for the role of student 
body president, we have decided not 
to endorse a candidate. As described,. 
we endorse candidates whom we 
believe deserve your votes. Unfor
tunately, this year we believe none 
of the three tickets has presented a 
compelling case for their candidacy. 
Each of the three has advantages and 
disadvantages, with none standing 
significantly above the others.
Casey Brander and Matt Sandler 
have provided a spectacle we have 
not witnessed in recent years. They 
are stark, honest, derisive, and pro
cyborg. While some have attacked 
them for mocking the process or 
turning democracy into performance 
art, they have followed every rule 
and made their method work with
in the system. They have brought a 
fresh perspective to the elections, but 
they have not shown a clear grasp of 
the issues or a commitment to the 
goals of the student body. As much 
as we actually would enjoy two-ply 
bathroom toilet paper, we dont be
lieve their platform or their experi
ence is enough to back them in this 
election.
Michael Surh and Micah Rosa ex
celled in the debate. They were well 
spoken, able to explain their innova
tive platform, and showed an under
standing of this campus as well as 
student government. However, even 
with new and creative ideas, we are 
not sure a website and employment 
opportunities are what we need stu
dent government to focus on over the 
next year. Their platform and back
ground is different, also in a way we 
havent seen before. It is conserva
tive, fiscally focused, and likfely not 
what the student body is seeking.
Jarrett Adams and Kate Smith 
should have captured our endorse
ment easily. With Adams student 
government experience (the only 
candidate with any) and Smiths 
committed involvement in Greek 
life, the pair seems to be the obvious 
choice. However, their performance 
at the debates was weak, their an
swers vague, and their ideas even 
less clear. Reading their extensive 
platform is an exercise in double
speak. They want reform but give no 
examples; they want more lectures, 
more Greek involvement, more uni
ty, and more transparency, but at 
no point do they explain how they 
will achieve any of these goals. They 
might have the most experience, but 
they have the least substance.

Governments do not serve public by appeasing Google
Last Thursday, April 1, Google 
changed its name to Topeka for the 
day.
This tongue-in-cheek humor rec
ognized one of the most absurd of a 
number of desperate attempts by cit
ies across the nation to win Googles 
contest for free high-speed broad
band.
For the entire month of March, 
the city of Topeka, Kan. unofficially 
changed its name to Google. Topeka 
is not the only community to take ex
treme measures to draw the search 
giants attention. One city executive 
in Minnesota jumped into the freez
ing waters of Lake Superior to show 
his dedication. Another official prom
ised in jest (we hope) to start naming 
babies after the company.
Here in Pittsburgh, there is a 
concerted Pittsburgh Goes Google 
movement. You probably received the 
official communication e-mail from 
President Cohon asking for your sup
port. Perhaps you participated in the 
stunt to spell Google in the middle 
of Downtown.
Efforts like these draw laughter, 
but they also indicate a deeper con
cern. Google  a corporation with a 
responsibility to its shareholders, not 
the public  is exerting tremendous 
influence in American society. Lo
cal governments across the United 
States are going to extreme lengths 
to appease the company.
We are concerned that these ac
tions end up serving private interests 
over those of the public.
Political lobbying by corporate 
entities is an established feature of 
American politics. Googles lobbying 
budget exceeds $1 million. The role 
of lobbyists has been examined and 
criticized for decades, but the influ
ence Google has on government to
day extends far beyond its teams of 
lawyers. Instead of Google lobbying 
city governments, these leaders are

In 1965, Mikhail Bakhtin de
fined the often-misunderstood 
and subversive term the carnivalesque in Rabelais and His 
World. It is the temporary over
turning of the dominant culture 
governing a space  in this case, 
academics at Carnegie Mellon.
But Im not here to sell you on 
Carnival. You already know that 
the four days of relaxation are a 
welcome reprieve from the normal 
hustle and bustle of classes, espe
cially this far into the school year. 
Im writing to you  the staff, fac
ulty, students, and others of the 
campus community  to explain 
to you just how much youll regret 
it if you dont make it out to watch 
the Buggy races this year.
Like Bakhtins term, the stu
dents who live and breathe Buggy 
are often misunderstood. What are 
they doing on Frew Street at 2 a.m. 
on a Wednesday? Why is there 
duct tape stuck to their shoes? 
Why didnt they sleep last night  
and what is in their hair?
But Carnival is your chance 
to learn. Two years ago, Pi Kappa 
Alpha, the team with the longest 
winning streak in Buggy history, 
broke a 20-year course record 
set by SPIRIT Racing Systems in 
1988. Last year, Student Dormi
tory Council broke that record by a 
full second  a huge chunk of time 
in a two-minute race. This years 
races are anyones game, and this 
is the best year yet to come out and 
watch records being shattered.
Buggy is unquestionably Carn
egie Mellons strongest and most 
unique tradition. It is perhaps the 
strongest pull bringing alumni  
both recent and of yore  back 
to campus. It is largely the reason 
why many class reunions were 
moved from Homecoming to Car
nival this year.
And on this race day, we cel
ebrate Buggys 90th anniversary 
with more pomp and circumstance 
than ever before. There will be two 
huge Jumbotron screens  one 
at the top of Tech Street and one 
at the corner of Schenley Drive 
and Frew Street, in the Chute  
to make it easier for you to watch 
the whole race from your favorite 
spot around the course. We have 
a brand new timing system to in
crease the accuracy and integrity 
of the races, and to underscore 
how technologically advanced the 
sport has become over the last 90 
years.
I invite you to witness this in
credible tradition this year, regard
less of how well you understand 
mechanical engineering, pushing 
technology, or petite female driv
ers (not that the Buggy mechanics 
themselves do, even after all this 
time). I promise you wont regret 
it.

You just might have heard about 
Apples newest device, the iPad. This 
device has polarized the high-tech 
industry, with people either loving it 
or hating it, and few standing in the 
middle ground. Now that the muchanticipated device has actually de
buted, it is time to end the wild specu
lation that has filled the media for the 
last three months and consider the 
opposing viewpoints on the device 
and its impact on the tech market.
The major selling point of the iPad 
has been users ability to consume text 
content in new and innovative ways. 
After using the iPad, we came to the 
consensus that it does perform its role 
as a magazine- or book-replacement 
device very well. Magazine content, 
particularly the Popular Science appli
cation, has been re-rendered in a way 
that pushes the boundaries of the tra
ditional magazine. In particular, arti
cles are contiguous, rather than being 
shattered and cast about the pages, 
and while there are still some kinks to 
work out, the innovation is clear. An
other great leap into the future comes 
from the Marvel Comics application,
which displays comic books at the full 
resolution of the device, rather than 
limiting rendering to the resolution 
of the printer. In addition, the appli
cation allows the user to zoom in on 
a particular panel, enlarging it and 
allowing the reader to catch more de
tail and appreciate the hard work that 
goes into the art of a comic book.
As impressive as all of this is, 
there are, inevitably, drawbacks. The 
brightness of the screen may pre
clude reading for extended periods of 
time, but without the brightness the 
rendering of the Popular Science and 
Marvel Comics applications would be 
lost. The device is also very difficult 
to use outdoors for the same reasons. 
Thus, the iPad will not replace physi
cal books or other e-reader devices. 
The design of the Popular Science and 
Marvel Comics applications is not 
anything that couldnt be implement
ed using Flash or HTML5, but the 
iPad is bringing these new designs 
from concept into reality.
There are some things that the 
iPad has significantly improved. The 
Brushes application, initially pro
duced for the iPhone, will be undeni
ably improved by the larger surface 
area of the iPad. Similarly, there is 
little question that casual games pop
ularized by the iPhone will benefit 
from the increased screen size. How
ever, this does not mean that existing 
iPhone applications will automatical
ly be improved on the iPad. In fact, it 
is quite the opposite. The iPad allows 
existing applications to be used either 
in a mode that emulates the iPhone
screen size or in a mode that expands 
the application to take up the entire 
screen. In the former mode, the ap
plications seem shrunken and insuffi
cient, and the iPad fails to live up the 
expectations of a new device. In the 
latter mode, the application becomes 
blocky and pixelated, stretched be
yond its means to fill a role it was 
never meant to have.
For the full promise of gaming on 
the device to be reached, iPad games 
need to be designed with the larger 
screen in mind. Even then, there is no 
expectation that the iPad will replace 
full computer systems for the hard
core gaming crowd.
One of the great advantages that 
Apple continues to leverage in their 
product design is their willingness to 
make decisions that, though restrict
ing for consumers, allow them to sim
plify the design of the product. For 
example, Apple continues to produce 
hand-held devices that are not userserviceable. Like the iPod and iPhone, 
there is no easy way to change the 
battery in the iPad. In fact, if you go 
to the Apple Store and request a bat
tery change, a service that Will cost 
$100, they will not take your device 
into the back and change the battery
 they will just hand you an entirely 
new device. Though many decry this 
as a great detriment to the long-term 
usefulness of the device, this policy 
allows Apple to pack their devices 
with more technology in less space. 
This gives Apple a competitive edge 
in a market that demands smaller and 
smaller devices but refuses to sacri

MICHAEL KAHN
There is a thin curtain between 
invasion and cooperation-assistance.
So said Afghan President Hamid 
Karzai in a speech last Thursday. But, 
if there is also a thin curtain between 
political necessity in a war-torn na
tion and abuse of power, Karzai is 
dangerously close to the wrong side. 
The past months have seen a cooling 
of his relationship with the United 
States, but more importantly they 
have seen an increasing trend toward 
the centralization of power. Signs of 
corruption in his government have 
been present for years, but they seem 
particularly dire in light of recent 
events.
Karzai must reform his admin
istration and accept the balance of 
power or he will lose all legitimacy
 and, with it, any hope of a stable 
government in Afghanistan.
Though several of Karzais actions 
over the past months warrant con
cern, a few are particularly egregious. 
The first of these was the widespread 
fraud in Afghanistans presidential 
election last year. In the first ballot, 
Karzai received over 54 percent of 
the vote, but the election commis
sion investigated nearly 20 percent 
of polling stations for fraud. Karzai 
initially refused a run-off vote, and 
though he eventually allowed one, 
it never occurred because his oppo
nent, Abdullah Abdullah, withdrew 
from the race. Abdullah cited his lack
of faith in a fair election when he left 
the race.
It is easy to cynically assert that 
fair and free elections are simply 
impossible in Afghanistan, a coun
try that suffered under the Taliban 
for seven years and has since expe
rienced over eight years of conflict. 
And while truly democratic elections 
with high turnout may be idealistic, 
the future of Afghanistan is not so 
bleak that we should accept fraud 
without complaint. Some pre-election opinion polls gave Abdullah over 
30 percent of the vote. The Afghan 
people are not blind to the events in 
their country, but they must be able 
to have their opinions heard.
In fact, the problems Karzai is 
creating within Afghanistan pose as 
much of a threat as his foreign policy 
failures. Many in Afghanistan blame 
him for economic problems as well as 
government corruption. He has not 
taken firm steps to control the poppy 
trade that funds Taliban fighters. The 
hope of a prosperous and reborn Af
ghanistan that existed after the fall 
of the Taliban government has only 
partially come to pass, and Karzais 
is the most recognizable face associ
ated with this failure.
As if the widespread election fraud 
in 2009 were not enough, in Febru
ary Karzai audaciously changed the 
composition of an electoral commis
sion that investigates allegations of 
fraud. Previously, three of the five 
members were appointed by the 
United Nations and two were ap
pointed by the president. Karzai now 
appoints the entire commission.
The lower house of the Afghan 
Parliament rejected the change 
last Wednesday, though questions

fice functionality.
One restriction that should be 
lifted is the requirement to own an 
additional computer to use the de
vice. After pulling an iPad out of the 
box, it will not do anything until it 
has been tethered to a computer with 
iTunes. Requiring an increasingly 
over-bloated iTunes to simply fill out 
a registration form is a fantastically 
stupid choice, destroying the possible 
market of people who could get by 
with an iPad as their primary com
puter. All Apple needs to do is update 
their software and add a registration 
form, requiring an iTunes account, to
remove this barrier.
In summary, the iPad is an excel
lent device on its technical merits. It is 
also clear that the device will change 
the way we think about some print 
media. However, its impact on other 
markets is still unclear, even after 
launch day. The talk about the iPad 
continues to be about its potential 
and not about the difference it has 
made.

remain as to if and when the com
mission will return to its former 
composition. In the meantime, the 
dispute has already destroyed much 
of the little legitimacy Karzai still 
had. Western nations were outraged 
after the February announcement, 
with President Barack Obama revok
ing a diplomatic invitation to his Af
ghan counterpart. Karzai responded 
by extending a diplomatic invita
tion to Iranian President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad. Relations between 
the US and Afghanistan have been
low for the last few months, though 
Obama visited Afghanistan and met 
with Karzai last week.
Its possible that there is some rea
sonable explanation for all of these 
events. Karzai has an incredibly dif
ficult job. He deserves, perhaps, the 
benefit of the doubt when it comes 
to Afghan politics. Fortunately, he 
explained his views on the election 
fraud and his reasons for changing 
the election commission.
There is no 'doubt that the fraud 
was very widespread, but this fraud
was not committed by Afghans  
it was committed by foreigners, 
Karzai said, according to The New 
York Times. There is a thin curtain 
between invasion and cooperationassistance.
The next time American agents 
commit voter fraud in Afghanistan, 
perhaps theyll have the foresight to 
elect someone else.

mentioned low-to-no-expectations group of teams used 
to be larger. The 2003 De
troit Tigers lost an American 
League record of 119 games 
and were the laughingstock 
of the league until they came 
out of nowhere in 2006 to 
make it all the way to the 
World Series. The Tampa Bay 
Rays played losing baseball 
from their inception into the 
majors in 1998 through 2007 
before similarly making the 
World Series in 2008.
Even the Nationals, when 
they moved to Washington 
in 2005, were in first place 
for the first half of the season 
before they remembered that 
they were the former Mon
treal Expos and fell complete
ly off the map in the second 
half.
Then there are teams like 
the Cincinnati Reds, who 
played shoddy baseball last 
year but made significant 
enough improvements in the 
off-season to put them on 
most peoples comeback list.
The Seattle Mariners, who 
played laughably in 2008, 
went back into the win col
umn last year and made a 
plethora of significant acqui
sitions over the winter. They 
are now the favorites to un
seat the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim as the AL West 
champions.
Unfortunately, the ball 
can roll the other way, as 
perhaps the new favorite 
to have the worst season in 
baseball is the Toronto Blue 
Jays. Formerly a sure choice 
for third place in the AL East 
behind Boston and New York, 
they fell behind the Rays in 
2008 and 2009. Over the off
season, though, they traded 
their ace Roy Halladay and, 
combined with the Orioles 
minor improvements, enter 
this season with the unoffi
cial motto of The Rebuilding 
Has Begun. Joining them as 
newer members in the writ
ten-off club are the Oakland 
As, the Cleveland Indians, 
and the San Diego Padres; 
the only bets people are plac
ing on the Padres involve if 
and when they trade star first 
baseman Adrian Gonzalez to 
the Red Sox.
But again, * hope springs 
eternal. No club, not even 
Toronto, goes into the season 
thinking theyve made their 
team worse. Who will be this 
years Tampa Bay? Who will 
be this years As? Who will 
be this years Pirates? At least 
that ones easy. Here are my 
predictions for this years di

The Carnegie Mellon golf 
team hit the greens last week 
at the Bridges Golf Club for 
the McDaniel Spring Invita
tional and shot 661 total to 
tie with Keystone College for 
12th place.
Sophomore Michael Cheng 
was the top contender for the 
Tartans, shooting 15 over par 
(81, 78, 159) to take 17th
in the individual standings. 
Close behind in 18th place 
was senior Brett Cannaday 
(80, 81, 161), who shot two 
strokes more than Cheng.
The last three members of 
the team were seniors Nick 
Burkholder (84, 86, 170), 
Christopher Lee (90, 83, 
173), and Adam Klein (88, 
91,179).
Still fresh, the Tartans 
headed to the New Castle 
Country Club the next day
and dominated the Titan In
vitational, taking second in a 
tournament of 12 teams. Af
ter two rounds of par-72 play, 
the Tartans ended with 321

After once again hitting 
the top-10 board in Division 
III last week, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens tennis team 
earned their spot and de
feated number-16 University 
of Mary Washington 8-1. The 
rebound win after two losses 
from last week put the Tar
tans at 9-5 for the season.
The Tartans wasted no 
time getting down to busi
ness. With quick 8-1 wins 
by the first doubles team of 
junior Ashley Herrick and 
sophomore Laura Chen and 
the third doubles team of 
sophomore Cze-Ja Tam and 
junior Jennifer Chui, the Tar
tans took a 2-0 lead. Sopho
more Courtney Chin and 
first-year Alex Tapak had a 
streaky match, blowing a 3-0 
lead before rallying to win 
9-7 to give the Tartans their 
first doubles sweep since 
March 12.
Without breaking a step, 
the Tartans continued their 
domination by taking five of 
the six singles. Chen dropped 
only two games against Ea
gles top singles player Court
ney Goimarac to win 6-1, 
6-1. Chin had a tough match 
at second singles, but battled 
to a third-set victory after be
ing down a set, with a score 
of 5-7, 7-5, 1-0. Tapak was 
a trooper and outplayed her 
opponent at third singles in 
a thrilling third set, 6-4, 3-6, 
1-0.
New to the singles lineup 
was junior Kelly Hart at the 
last singles position, who 
easily took out her opponent 
6-2, 6-3.
This was an encouraging 
win for us, Hart said.

Tartans upset the number-nine Blue Jays with a lopsided score of 7-2.
Hopkins has beaten us three 
times in a row, including six 
weeks ago, so I was proud of 
the team. Next weekend, we 
will play some tough teams, so 
we have to make sure we stay 
focused.
This was a good day for
us, Muliawan said. My 
matches were close, but Im 
glad Jeremy and I were able 
to pull it out. Hopkins is a top10 team, so this just shows we 
can battle with the best.

Spero, playing fifth singles, 
finished first, dominating his 
opponent 6-4, 6-0. Nemerov 
followed suit and dropped 
only three games against topranked David Maldow to win 
6-2, 6-1, giving the Tartans 
the fifth point for a victory. 
Muliawan and first-year Harsha Rao each pulled out thirdset wins to bring the total 
points to seven.
For the Tartans, this was 
one of the best upsets of the

The Carnegie Mellon 
track and field team found 
themselves competing in yet 
another invitational on Sat
urday, April 3. At Washington 
and Jefferson College, the 
Tartans competed against 14 
challenging teams, with the 
women coming in third place 
and the men dominating in 
first.
Major contributors to the 
womens third-place finish 
included junior Courtney 
Baker, who won the 800-me
ter run for the second year 
in a row with a new meet re
cord of 2:17.15. Junior team
mate Laura McKee was not 
far behind, snagging third 
in the event with a time of

included senior Crystal LeePow, who claimed fourth in 
the 400-meter hurdles in a 
time of 1:09.14, and firstyear Emily Wobb, who took 
fourth in the 1500-meter run

After finishing fourth in 
the University Athletic Asso
ciation (UAA) conference for 
the indoor season, Carnegie 
MeUons track and field team 
is forging ahead into outdoor 
competition. Recently, junior 
middle distance runner Nate 
Bussiere was named the UAAs 
Track and Field Athlete of the 
Week. Bussiere finished third 
in the mile run at the indoor 
championship meet.
He has since stepped up 
his performance by provision
ally qualifying for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Outdoor Championships in the 
very first meet of the outdoor 
season at Washington and Lee 
last weekend.
Bussiere is a pioneering stu
dent. He petitioned for a track 
team to be instituted at his 
high school in Canton, Conn. 
during his sophomore year. 
Since it was such a young pro
gram, Bussiere didnt find his 
niche in middle distance run
ning until his senior season.
While he had originally 
planned to play soccer at Car
negie Mellon, Bussiere picked
up track  as well as cross 
country  on a whim and 
maintains that it was a great 
decision.
Bussiere claims that his true 
spark for running was ignited 
this past fall. He was inspired 
by his high-caliber team: Be
ing on such a gifted team and 
competing at the national level 
changed the way I run every 
race now.
While majoring in chemi
cal engineering, Bussiere 
likes to stay active by playing 
soccer, racquetball, and Fris
bee. Because of his interest in 
jazz music, Bussiere has audi
tioned for and been offered a 
part in Carnegie Mellons jazz 
ensemble. Time constraints 
with school and running com
mitments keep Bussiere from 
playing with the ensemble, but 
he remains an avid supporter. 
He would like to keep running 
in the future, participating in 
road races and marathons.
For now, he wants to con
centrate on the task at hand: 
bringing the team back to a 
victorious conference cham
pionship, and urging some 
breakthrough performances 
from himself and his talented 
teammates.

Ah, baseball season. Hope 
springs eternal. The crack of 
the bat, the pop of the mitt, 
the uninhibited stream of pro
fanity coming from everyone 
in my familys mouth toward 
the TV...
I believe baseball was the 
main reason we stopped try
ing to keep it clean in front 
of my baby brother.
Today marks the true be
ginning of the 2010 baseball 
season. Twenty-eight of 30 
Major League teams play their 
season openers, many while 
were still in class, but with 
technology these days its 
impossible not to follow the 
game even without a TV or 
a ticket. If you like baseball, 
youll find a way.
True, the official begin
ning of the season was Sun
day night, when major league 
baseballs overzealous sched
ulers pitted the New York 
Yankees against the Boston 
Red Sox in the first game of 
2010. Putting such a fierce ri
valry front and center may be 
great for ESPNs ratings, but 
season-opening series arent 
meant for that kind of intense 
history. Save those matchups 
and pile them on as much as 
possible later in the season, 
when both teams are playing 
must-win games, and theres 
your rivalry.
Thats what it came down 
to last year, as the Red Sox 
won all eight of their meet
ings against the Yankees from 
April to June before the Yanks 
won nine of the 10 remaining 
games in August and Septem
ber en route to clinching the 
American League East title 
and, eventually, winning the
World Series.
When my team, the New 
York Mets, open their season 
at 1:10 p.m. against the Flor
ida Marlins, itll begin their 
162-game chance to prove 
that their dismal 2009 season 
was a fluke, that they can stay 
healthy (they had 17 players 
on the disabled list last year), 
and that they can go back to 
being a serious contender. 
The Marlins will not be out to 
prove much; rather, like every 
year, theyll hope to surprise.
The Marlins, much like the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, Kansas City 
Royals, Washington Nation
als, and Baltimore Orioles, 
tend not to have much in the 
expectation department each 
year; however, unlike the oth
ers, the Marlins have winning 
seasons every now and again. 
Thats where the surprise 
comes in.
Some Pirates were quoted 
in the off-season as consid
ering the playoffs a pretty 
reasonable goal for the club.
Others claim finally having 
any winning percentage at or 
over .500 is reasonable. After 
a professional sports record of
17 straight losing seasons and 
a relatively quiet off-season
 acquiring infielder Akinori 
Iwamura was their one really 
big move  its hard to believe 
anything good at all will come 
from this season. But the sea
son has yet to begin, and opSee BASEBALL, A10

Student jazz musicians impress audiences
Experimental ensembles receive weak turnout at Carnegie Music Hall
Everything you need to know
About when your grades drop but your weight wont
For many, jazz has always been like the taste of 
an expensive wine: something adults have taken 
the time to appreciate, something that we should 
learn to love. I regret to tell you that I havent taken 
enough time to enjoy either one; the legs of a white 
wine are still as unimpressive as the poetic meter 
inherent in jazz.
Given my own disinterest in adult sophistication, 
it was surprising to see that a group of kids my age 
were passionate enough to perform at Carnegie 
Music Hall last Wednesday. Even more surprising: 
that I slowly became excited to see those kids 
(Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School, 
Carnegie Mellons 6:30 Jazz Ensemble, and Virginia 
Wesleyan College) play. Would they be the ones 
able to break the stuffy spell looming over poor 
instrumental musics head? Could one finally look 
past the whispers of the acoustic guitar to which 
many have grown so accustomed?
The concert was not the idealistic showing of young 
support I had imagined, especially for a traditionally 
experimental, raunchy form of music. It seemed as 
if the intellectual, incomprehensible stigma I had 
attached to jazz was not mine alone. Less than a 
hundred students had said they were attending the 
event on Facebook, and even fewer seemed to fill the 
auditorium. Given that the tickets were free with a 
Carnegie Mellon ID, this was a little disappointing.
Those participating in the performance, however, 
lived up to lofty expectations. All the gears that 
make up the musical machine called jazz  call and 
response, instrumental poetry, cool cats  were
present and turning, springing the formerly 
hollow machine to life. The musicians were totally 
immersed in what they were playing.
As a visual learner, the easiest way to express 
the appeal of jazz I discovered that night is by 
likening it to modern art. Most outsiders are made 
uncomfortable by the thought of a Jackson Pollock 
selling for millions: Most protests are along the lines 
of I could do that" or thats just scribbles  theres 
no-real meaning in it.
Discounting the fact that most musicians practice 
for years to be able to perform at a venue like 
Carnegie Music Hall, you could make the argument 
that free-flowing solos could be done by almost 
anyone, or that because jazz usually isnt dripping 
with melodramatic lyrics about lost love, its not 
charged with enough meaning or emotion. Your 
argument wouldnt go very far. In the performance 
last Wednesday, each verse was filled with 
well-rehearsed precision, each solo with creative, 
clever improvisation.
*Terence Einhorn, a sophomore in decision science 
and a performer in the Carnegie Mellon 6:30 Jazz 
Ensemble, summed up his experience. It was nice, 
he said. No one showed up, but whatever. Maybe 
jazz will always be foreign to young people looking 
for the next easy-to-swallow pop song. But to those 
who take the time to appreciate it, jazz can be quite 
enjoyable.

Dear Rohit,
Senior slide is starting 
to kick in. Im usually 
extremely productive, 
but I seem to spend all 
my time procrastinating, 
waiting for the day when I 
can get out of here. How 
can I finish strongly this 
semester?
Taken by Senioritis
Dear Taken,
I can relate. My friends 
have senioritis cases so 
advanced that it took a lot 
of effort to find time to crank 
put this article in between 
listening to their symptoms. 
Hour-long lectures seem to 
last for weeks. Homework 
assignments feel like they 
should be illegal under the 
Geneva Convention. In short, 
everything is harder.
Whatever causes this malady, 
theres only one thing that 
I can suggest to combat it. 
Just keep plugging away at 
it. They call it a senior slide 
for a reason. Once you start 
sliding, its hard to stop. Try 
to cure this disease before 
its too late. If this means 
planning weekly study hours 
or even working on the 
weekends, then so be it.
If theres anything to work 
toward, its post-college 
laziness. Ive heard from 
several sources that the 
work after Carnegie Mellon 
is comparatively a breeze. 
So look forward to brighter, 
lazier days ahead. Just dont 
do it here. It doesnt work,' 
regardless of your year.
With a D (for diploma),
Rohit
Dear Rohit,
I decided the other day 
that Im going on a diet. 
Im currently about 40 or 
50 pounds overweight and 
would like to know some 
suggestions about how to 
lose some inches.
Lean in Wean
Dear Lean,
Often I hear disbelief from 
the skinny crowd as to how 
obese people cant just 
stop eating and lose weight. 
Unfortunately, its not that 
easy. Its not so much about 
quantity as it is about quality. 
The hardest part of your 
dieting wont be the bad 
taste of healthy food, or even 
hunger. The real challenge is 
remembering youre on a diet 
in the first place.
Think about it. For the past 
20 years, youve probably 
developed some pretty 
nasty eating habits that are 
sabotaging any plans you 
have for losing weight. My 
downfall is French fries. I 
would eat them night and 
day if I didnt care about the 
social consequences. Your 
job is to find your French 
fries equivalent.
In the end, the question will 
come down to whether you 
want to give up your habits. 
Personally, if I had to choose 
between French fries and 
the perfect body, I would 
pick French fries even before 
knowing what else I had 
to choose from. Hopefully, 
youre better than that.
Dont fry it up,
 Rohit

Tales from abroad: Nicaragua
Read along as this student shares his experiences serving the community abroad
The 10 of us made it to Nicaragua. After a year of 
planning for the unexpected, having long discussions 
about sustainability, panicking about the seemingly 
insurmountable amount of funds to raise, selling donuts, 
cookies, pizza,.donuts, soup, Ritas, raffles tickets, 
donuts, donuts, and even more donuts... we finally made 
it to Nicaragua.
Even after all the planning and preparation, I still think 
that I wasnt prepared for what we would learn, the 
bonds we would make with the community, or the 
experiences that would make me long to return.
After a night in a small motel, we traveled in a tiny 
12-passenger plane that swayed and rocked with 
every gust of wind. Hidden behind the mountainous 
ridges was a small gravel landing strip that marked 
our entrance to the place we would spend the next 
week  Siuna. We spent some time in Siuna touring 
through the local hospital, marketplace, and university. 
Siuna is one of the poorest cities in Nicaragua, a city 
that had its local water resources destroyed by American 
and Canadian mining during the first half of the 20th 
century. Although they have had to deal with a failing 
infrastructure, the community has been able to make 
progress with the help of the university and community 
organizations, such as our partner organization Bridges 
to Community.
After a canoe ride through the jungle, we finally made 
it to a rural village called Amparo. We received a warm 
welcome from the community and began unpacking our 
bags and mosquito nets in the community church.
We spent the week in Amparo in order to learn how 
we could successfully work with the community on 
sustainable projects. During the week, we built latrines
and clean-burning stoves with a lot of help from the 
locals. The stoves we built would reduce the danger of 
smoke inhalation. During the rainy season, the latrines 
would promote a more sanitary living environment for 
families.
We also had the opportunity to have art workshops 
with a local elementary school. The school was more 
like a room in which the teachers had to educate all the 
first- to fifth-graders in the community. Needless to say, 
their resources were spread thin. We were able to give 
these children a chance to explore art and provide them 
with the materials to pursue this outlet. Our workshops 
culminated in a wonderful mural of the school painted 
by all the children. We had some of our best moments, 
however, with the kids playing "Simone dice" (my 
impromptu translation of "Simon Says) and breaking the 
language barrier by running, jumping, and crashing into 
each other.
Even though we spent the week without running water  
or electricity, we loved every minute of it. At night we 
would be able to walk from under the overhang of the 
church and gaze upwards towards the sky. Having spent 
my whole life in the city, I can remember few other 
times in my life when I saw so many stars. Cooling off by 
bathing in the river after a long day of building latrines 
and stoves was always gratifying.
All pleasantries aside, we spent each day working 
ourselves to the bone. At certain points, we would feel 
incapable of doing half the amount of work that our 
comrades Don Margarito, Don Luis, or Hugo could do 
within 10 minutes. This humbled even the most capable 
of our group.
I remember one specific example when I was gathering
gravel to help construct the latrine. As I packed a 
50-pound bag of gravel on top of a pack mule, I looked 
over to Sebastian, the owner of the soon-to-be-built 
latrine, to make sure I hadnt forgotten anything. 
Although it really was a simple task  grab the bag, 
fill it with gravel, lift it on top of the mule, pack it on, 
repeat  I was nervous. I didnt want to look like an idiot 
in front this guy who, at the age of 20, had a 20-acre plot 
of land, a three-year-old child, a wife, 30 cows, and 10 
chickens. For all intents and purposes, this guy was a 
cowboy. At 20! Kind of makes you feel unaccomplished, 
doesnt it?
Even though I was intimidated, he didnt shy away from 
conversation. We were able to joke about scary movies 
we had seen (he loves scary movies), baseball teams, 
and different types of girls we like. I forget sometimes 
that even though people may have grown from entirely 
different backgrounds, there is always some sort of 
common ground among us. Over the course of the week 
we played baseball with the boys in the community, 
enjoyed long discussions about the history of Nicaragua 
and Siuna, and really began looking at what we could 
possibly do working side by side with the members of 
this community in the next few years.
I still find it hard to describe my trip in Siuna. It is easy 
to show a person a picture of the dense jungles we were 
in, the boat that capsized during one of our expeditions 
to Amparo, the friendly community who rarely seemed 
to smile for pictures, but it is hard to explain the sense of 
belonging I felt and my hope that we can do something 
good with these people. I loved my trip, and all the 
donuts that I still have to sell cant change my mind.

On music criticism
Hr Students anticipate the arrival of hyped band
During your current walks between 
classes, you may have noticed 
black and white posters 
featuring a womans face 
covered by a scarf. If not, 
then surely you have 
noticed this picture 
while spending 
countless hours on 
Facebook. Either 
way, with all the 
buzz around 
campus, many 
have heard about 
Sleigh Bells, the 
noise pop band 
set to perform 
Wednesday 
night at the 
CFA Alumni 
Concert Hall.
If you have heard the chatter, you might be 
wondering what the fuss is really about.
Guitarist and songwriter Derek E. Miller, a former 
member of the metal-core band Poison the Well, met 
vocalist Alexis Krauss in 2008 while serving Krauss 
and-her mother at a restaurant. When he mentioned 
that he was looking for a female vocalist, Krauss 
mother immediately nominated her daughter. Krauss 
was a schoolteacher who had spent some of her teen 
years singing on pop records. A few weeks after 
their initial meeting, they became Sleigh Bells.
They recently signed to M.I.A.s label N.E.E.T. and 
have made plans to release their debut album,
Treats, on May 11, 2010. They have released several 
tracks online, the most'popular of these being 
Crown on the Ground, which Pitchfork named the 
57th best track of 2009. Sleigh Bells has been named 
a band to watch on numerous music sources and 
blogs, including Stereogum.
Their music is high in volume and energy, using 
synthesized sounds, strong beats, and decibel 
overloading. With pop undertones, their songs are 
catchy and exciting; however, the tracks remain 
distinct from pop songs because of their background 
sounds, grainy noises, and rumbles from Miller's 
guitar and an iPod.
The duo recently played at South by Southwest, one 
of the largest music festivals in the United States, 
which takes place every spring in Austin, Texas. 
They garnered a lot of attention from multiple media 
sources after their performance.
Entertainment Weekly said they pulled off one of 
the most contagious, sloppy fun moments of the 
festival so far and described their music as "kind 
of like NWA meets Le Tigre, with Sabbath riffs and 
ESG on backup.
With all of the hype, it would be a shame to miss 
their performance in such an intimate setting as the 
Alumni Concert Hall. Tickets are $5 and are only sold 
at the door. Doors open Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and 
the show starts at 8 p.m. Get there early because the 
show might sell out. Be prepared to dance the night 
away.

What is music criticism? What has it been? What is it now? 
Music criticism is tied into social class, race, and politics as 
much as it is tied into novelty and modernity. So, in one word, 
music criticism is, has been and always will be convoluted.
Case in point: I once criticized the song Mr. November 'by 
The National as being bad. I didnt give any reason. The 
next thing I knew, I was being called a right-leaning moderate 
who was criticizing a song that, was, among many, an 
anthem of change for the Obama/Biden elections. It was an 
honest mistake; in truth, I just disapproved of the excessive 
screaming and profanity.
At this point, no one cares about my opinions on Mr. 
November. In fact, I would guess that most would agree with 
me in saying that the song is not one of The Nationals best  I 
should know; Im one of their biggest fans. The funniest part 
of this entire episode: I am a moderate who often leans right 
on economic policy, and The National is a band that leans 
hard left. Classifying me based on the music I like and dislike 
is not entirely inappropriate.
Now, I dont know how I feel about being so easily labeled 
by genre. I really hate being labeled a hipster for liking indie 
music, but I am pretty hip.
I would like to blame this all on an opportunistic and exploitative 
music industry, but that excuse has run its course with the 
meteoric rise in independent labels. What we accomplish 
now by criticizing music is anybodys guess.

Comedy rock group plays benefit concert
The brothers of Sigma Nu and other student boards host Chester French in Rangos Hall
The fraternity Sigma Nu, along with members of the 
Activities Board and Student Dormitory Council, 
sponsored a charity concert Thursday night featuring 
Chester French. Unlike many other fundraisers, the 
concert allowed the audience to have direct input as 
to where the proceeds were donated. This included 
organizations that focused on fighting poverty, 
improving health care, and expanding access to 
education.
From the moment you were greeted by the brothers of 
Sigma Nu with CDs disguised as super-sized condoms, 
you knew you were in for quite an experience. The 
show opened with Pet Leviathan, an experimental 
band that originated at Carnegie Mellon and includes 
sophomore BHA student and guitarist Mark Palantoni, 
sophomore English major and drummer Aaron Bernkopt, 
and sophomore University of North Carolina student 
and vocalist Bobby Allan. With inspiration derived from 
Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and 
Jimi Hendrix, the band expressed their energy. Many 
members of the audience eventually reached a point 
where they could no longer withstand all the yelling and 
decided to take a break.
Following Pet Leviathan was the much-anticipated 
performance by Chester French, comprising lead 
vocalist and songwriter David-Andrew D.A." Wallach 
and multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Maxwell 
Drummey. The group originally formed in 2003 as a 
five-piece comedy rock group while the two were 
first-years at Harvard University. A year later, the duo 
became involved as recording engineers for Harvards 
Quad Studios. It was during that time that Wallach and 
Drummey wrote, produced, and engineered Love the 
Future, their first demo, which caught the attention of 
Kanye West in 2007. With priorities that Carnegie Mellon 
students understand all too well, Wallach and Drummey 
felt compelled to take their game theory and social 
anthropology exams, respectively, before leaving for Los 
Angeles, where they met with managers, agents, and, 
of course, West to discuss their musical careers. Chester 
French has now been signed by Pharrell Williams to 
Interscope Records, home to U2, Eminem, and Gwen 
Stefani. Additionally, since the release of their first 
album, the duo has toured and collaborated on projects 
with Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, West, Talib Kweli, Blink-182, 
Weezer, and Asher Roth.
For Carnegie Mellon students to see Chester French 
in such a personal and informal manner was truly a 
privilege. After performing on MTV, as well as on Late 
Night with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Live!, 
Rangos Hall must not have seemed exceptionally 
glamorous. So how exactly did Carnegie Mellon elicit 
such an opportunity, especially considering the fact that 
Chester French is currently recording their new album 
and is therefore not performing in any shows?
Saptarshi Ghose, a first-year Sigma Nu brother pursuing 
an ethics, history, and public policy major, tapped into 
his resources in order to contribute to both a meaningful 
philanthropic cause and the reputation of his fraternity. 
Wallach and Ghose attended the same high school, the 
University School of Milwaukee. Wallach graduated 
with Ghose's brother, one of his best friends, in 2003. 
Therefore, it was possible for the two to keep in touch, 
even after they entered college.
I pitched the idea to D.A. during my senior year in high 
school, and he was genuinely interested in playing, 
Ghose recalled. I asked him if he and Max would be 
able to play at a benefit concert at CMU. And, despite 
being occupied with recording their new album and 
not being able to tour for several months, D.A. and Max 
were incredibly kind to come to Pittsburgh and play 
a one-of-a-kind show. This held true when Chester 
French was unable to bring their full band to Pittsburgh, 
but they performed in a more informal manner, complete 
with a guitar, tambourine, and Wallachs impeccable 
beat-boxing abilities.
The bands performance included a variety of songs, 
ranging from The Jimmy Choos" and Beneath the 
Veil to "She Loves Everybody and Two Mans.
Each contained a different message, such as the 
bands expression of interest in girls who were down 
to earth, the description of a sexual experience, and 
a girl who took the mentality of experimenting freely 
too far. Moreover, the music had broad appeal. Amid 
the blend of hip-hop and pop, there was something 
that everyone could enjoy. Wallach also entertained the 
audience with tidbits about the bands creation and 
musical inspiration, as well as provided pieces of advice 
that he believed would be applicable to nerds just like 
him  C++ is hot in this recession, so dont be shy!
Overall, Chester French was tremendously talented and 
incredibly charismatic, as exhibited by the multiple
Jessica Sochol | Photo Staff
shrieks of adoration from the females in the audience 
and after the show when the duo agreed to answer 
questions, sign autographs, and pose for photographs. 
Additionally, while the event turned out a small 
audience, the support of the Carnegie Mellon community 
greatly contributed to charity.
Chester French really doesnt remind me of any other 
band, and that may be why I think theyre such a 
fantastic group, Ghose said. While it is clear that they 
are well learned in all types of music, their sound is one 
and their own. With every one of their releases, I feel like 
they are stretching the boundaries of the norm in pop 
music, and doing so remarkably well.
You can check out the band and download a free mix 
tape at www.chesterfrench.com.

Chester French smoothly incorporated comedy into 
their act, but there is no denying that they will always 
be musicians first and foremost.

The Antique
Tuesday, April 6

Youre in for a treat here 
as AB presents a free 
pre-screening of The Antique, 
a spooky film that the studio is 
audience-testing before it hits 
theaters nationwide. The film, 
which runs just 65 minutes, is a 
horror story about a mommas 
boy who starts to see and hear 
things after he finds an antique 
picture frame. Everything gets 
a little bit creepier as the main 
character wonders whether he 
is going insane or a ghost is 
actually haunting him and his 
family.
A Serious Man
Thursday, April 8 
8 10 12
Noted directors Joel and Ethan 
Cohen penned this flick about 
a Midwestern professor whose 
life begins to go down the tubes 
after a series of bizarre and 
inexplicable events. The dark 
comedy, which has earned rave 
reviews from critics across the 
country, focuses on men and 
women trying to make some 
sense of the events that unfold. 
The story is loosely based on 
the life of Job from the Bible, 
not Will Arnetts character from 
Arrested Development.
Up in the Air
Friday, April 9 
10 12:30
Up in the Air is a stellar film from 
director Jason Reitman, famous 
for Juno. George Clooney and 
newcomer Anna Kendrick 
star in this trendy movie that 
focuses on people whose job 
it is to break the news to the 
thousands of people who are 
fired every day. An extremely 
timely movie due to the recent 
recession, Up in the Air is a 
funny, yet thoughtful, look at 
the ups and downs of everyday 
working life.
Sherlock Holmes
Saturday, April 10
10 12:30
Robert Downey Jr. and 
Jude Law star as Holmes 
and Watson in this frenetic 
and brawny update of the 
well-known detective. With a 
recent spate of movies getting 
gritty reboots nowadays, 
Sherlock Holmes is one of 
few that does not disappoint, 
largely thanks to Downey Jr.s 
incredible charrn on the big 
screen. Fun fact: Sherlock 
Holmes has been played by 
more actors than any other 
character in the history, of 
cinema.
Boondock Saints II
Sunday, April 11 
7:30 10 12:30
Even though the original 
Boondock Saints never needed 
a sequel due to its status as 
one of the greatest cult classic 
movies ever made, director 
Troy Duffy chose to make one. 
The sequel is another revenge 
thriller, bringing the MacManus 
brothers back to Boston on a 
killing spree after their priest 
is murdered by mobsters.
Fun fact: This flick is arguably 
tamer than the original, with the 
F-word being used 136 times, 
as opposed to 247 in the first 
Boondock Saints.

Pittsburgh boasts impressive spring concerts
Many big names in the music industry make the Burgh a stop on their U.S. tours
r by Nick GuestoStaffwriter]
As the sun begins to remind us of its greatness and the 
number of weeks left of classes can be counted on a 
single hand, many things are happening in Pittsburgh 
to welcome spring. As we break out the flip-flops and 
ditch the hot chocolate, music venues both small and 
large are welcoming a range of musical talent in the 
coming months. Musicians from across the country will 
be coming to the 'Burgh, occupying venufcs to satisfy the 
tastes of those hungry to hear some good tunes.
The Five Percent, Caleb Lovely
Saturday, April 10 at 10:30 p.m.
Club Caf 
$5
Coming from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area in 
northeastern Pennsylvania, The Five Percent has grown 
to national fame. Their most recent release was their 
June 2009 album A Summer Sunday Morning at Dawn.
Caleb Lovely is a Pittsburgh native and already a triple 
threat at just 21. He writes, sings, and plays all the 
instruments in his songs. His honest lyrics and folksy 
riffs serve for great easy-listening tunes, which are 
featured on his self-titled LP released in May 2009.
Wilco
Sunday, April 11 at 8 p.m.
Carnegie Music Hall 
$70-$110
Their most recent release came in June 2009, titled 
Wilco. Members of the band are Jeff Tweedy, John 
Stirratt, Glenn Kotche, Nels Cline, Pat Sansone, and 
Mikael Jorgensen. One critic gave an incredibly colorful
description, calling them alt-country, Americana, 
neo-folk, quasi-experimental, and, if you insist, dad 
rock." Sometimes they sound like Spoon, sometimes like 
Bright Eyes, but mostly theyve captured a unique sound 
that's bound to give your ears a good feeling.
The Used

Lead singer Burt McCrackens voice is pretty 
identifiable, and he joins up with bandmates Quinn 
Allman, Jeph Howard, and Dan Whitesides as they come 
to Pittsburgh in mid-April. Their latest release, Artwork, 
came out in late August 2009. Though they're most 
appropriately labeled as punk rock meets emo, they've 
been known to garner some fans from mainstream 
radio-only sounds.

Born in Hawaii to Cuban parents, Malo lets an obvious 
Caribbean vibe color his music.
Brand New
Club Zoo
Sunday, April 25 at 7:30 p.m.
$25
One of the biggest names to hit Pittsburgh this spring, 
Brand New has had a great deal of success. Their 
fourth and most recent album, Daisy, hit the shelves

Derrick Sherman.
Miss May I
Thursday, April 29 at 6:30 p.m.

Their debut, Apologies Are for the Weak, came out in 
late June 2009. Members Levi Benton, Jerod Boyd, B.J. 
Stead, Justin Aufdenkampe, and Ryan Neff are enjoying 
the national touring that comes with being a band.
Their music isnt for everyone, and unless you crave 
unidentifiable lyrics and hardcore screaming, Miss May 
I may not be your cup of tea. But for those who enjoy 
metal core, theyve got heavy riffs and energy thatll 
surely put on an entertaining show.

Piano- and ukulele-playing Christofer Ingle, working 
under the alias Never Shout Never, has released six EPs 
and is currently putting the final touches on its debut 
full-length album.
Hey Monday, a quartet thats three parts guy and one 
part girl, tours while singing songs from their 2008 
debut, Hold On Tight. Reminiscent of Paramore due 
to their lineup and pop-punk style, Cassadee Pope,
Mike Gentile, Alex Lipshaw, and Michael Moriarty are 
nonetheless able to put together solid tunes.
The Cab, dubbed The Band You Need to Know" in 
2008s Alternative Press, just released their debut album, 
Whisper War. The Las Vegas quartet consists of Alex 
DeLeon, Alex Marshall, Alex Johnson, and Joey Thunder.
Every Avenue, made up of David Strauchman, Joshua 
Randall, Jimmie Deeghan, Matt Black, and Dennis 
Wilson, may seem like any other pop-punk group out 
there today, but their music is quite refreshing.
The Summer Set, a power pop group comprised of Brian 
Dales, Stephen Gomez, Jess Bowen, John Gomez, and 
Josh Montgomery, debuted their first full-length album, 
Love Like This, in October 2009.

through the area. The hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse 
comes May 23. A trio of alternative pop-rock bands 
(Daughtry, Lifehouse, and Cavo) plays on June 2. The 
mellow men of the Dave Matthews Band  who manage 
to demand extremely high prices for tickets, but still sell 
out arenas and pavilions  play at PNC Park on July
10. The Amphitheatre at Station Square will host two 
great performers over the summer: on July 13, BB King 
performs, while on August 6, the Ladies of Heart will

Find the perfect snack at Kohlis
Convenient grocery meets tasty Indian cuisine on South Craig Street
Jesse Kummer | Personnel Manager
Kohlis is an Indian grocery on South Craig Street, 
hidden between Union Grill and Luccas. Initially, 
my trip to Kohlis was focused on getting a gallon of 
milk. Then, with milk off my list, I began to collect 
more groceries that I would usually get from Giant 
Eagle.
As I wasnt familiar with Indian cuisine, wandering 
around Kohlis was an entirely new experience for 
me. Rather than going to Kohlis for just a gallon of 
milk or some onions and shallots, I went through 
Kohlis for a vacation.
Opened in 1989 as a strictly Indian grocery, Sanjeev 
Kohlis South Craig Street store later expanded into 
a general store; however, Indian and Middle Eastern 
ingredients are still the primary sale items.
To most students, Kohlis is probably well known 
for their samosas. You can get a samosa  a fried 
dough snack stuffed with spiced potato  for only 
90 cents. Even when its a little colder than you 
might prefer, this over-stuffed, spice-filled pocket is 
an affordable between-meal snack and is very filling.
Besides samosas, Kohlis carries other ready-to-eat 
foods. Another big draw is their popular chicken 
lunch: About 150 chicken lunches are sold each 
day. Many of their top-selling foods are shipped 
from various Indian restaurants in New York or 
Washington D.C.
Imported goods are also shipped to Kohlis from 
major Indian importers in Detroit and other cities. 
The spice packs they sell are the same as those used 
in traditional kitchens throughout India.
A well-known Indian dish is chicken tikka masala, 
a dish which writer Shoba Narayan called Britains 
national dish" because it is so popular in England. 
With tikka masala mix purchased from Kohlis and 
a cut of chicken, you are ready to create a delicious 
meal.
For those who pass Kohlis on their way home, it can 
be a great last-minute grocery stop before making 
dinner. At Kohlis you can get basics like ginger, 
onion, eggplant, or exotic long squashes. Kohli, 
the stores owner, said that all of the stores fresh 
produce is shipped from Florida.
Kohli also has a regular American grocery selection
 providing customers with jars of pickles, trash 
bags, dish detergent, and even lasagna. Kohlis is 
definitely more accessible than youd think. In terms 
of business, Kohli said that the store expands and 
grows with the needs of customers.

Kohlis is not just an Indian grocery store; it is a 
grocery store with a strong focus on Indian and 
other Asian cuisine, since Indians share a culinary 
background with some other Southeast Asian and 
Middle Eastern regions. Indian students may find 
comfort in familiar surroundings, but to me, walking 
into the unfamiliar setting with different aromas 
was like a micro-vacation. The charm of traveling is 
getting away from the usual routine. In this case, I 
found it by working my way through an unfamiliar 
aisle.

Your love life is spiraling out of control. Dont do anything 
about it. The inhabitants of the Alpha Centauri system really 
want to watch the drama unfold.

the IRS will feed you to the Beast of Karakthor.
Grind up all of your valuables, mix them with flour and water,

you defenestrate your couch and half of your dining room 
chairs.

Patrick Gage Kelley | Contributing Editor
Last Saturday evening, Dan Deacon compelled a mass of students 
to shout "Hakuna Matata," point at their neighbors who would not 
touch the earth, and most importantly jump, shout, and raise their 
arms to the sky as he performed. Glowsticks, hula hoops, and skulls 
projected on Doherty were all part of the experience. Stageless, he 
was surrounded by sweaty hipsters who were there to dance the 
night away in the warm April weather.
