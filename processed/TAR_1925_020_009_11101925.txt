FOOTBALL NUMBER OF 
PUPPET WILL APPEAR 
ON CAMPUS NOV. 17
A Puppet reporter happened to be 
in Moerlines getting a chocolate milk 
shake when he overheard startling 
news of seductions, secret marriages, 
and foul play right on our campus. 
The whole thing is going to be ex
posed in the Football Number of the 
Puppet which makes its appearance 
next Tuesday.
Nothing like It has ever happened 
in any publication on the campus, in
cluding the Shilling and Technical 
Journal. Just imagine the predica
ment of the erring ones. Already the 
parties concerned have offered huge 
sums to keep the news off the camp 
us, but the Puppet is faithful to her 
readers and will give them the grue
some details as is and intact.
Those of you who have spent a 
couple or more winters going through 
the motions of being a student at this 
Chapel of Learning will remember 
the Tootin Numbers of old. The next 
issue will be along those lines, only 
with some real dirt to spill. No less 
than seven Sunday Supplements have 
tried to get permission to run the 
story, but without avail. In fact two 
suicides are expected as the result of 
this exposure, and if they dont dis
appoint us, we will publish the details 
of them in the Xmas Puppet.
It is almost inconceivable that all 
this is going to be in addition to the 
regular Football Number of the Pup
pet.
BACH CHOIR NEEDS MEN'S
VOICES TO GIVE ORATORIO
The Bach Choir will present the 
Christmas Oratorio on Sunday even
ing, December 13, at Carnegie Music 
Hall. An orchestral work by Bach, 
and Adeste Fideles, by choir and 
Symphony Orchestra, will complete 
the program.
The choir meets on Monday and 
Thursday afternoons at 4:30 oclock in 
the Rehearsal Hall on the second 
floor of the Arts Building. Extra re
hearsals, scheduled for Thursday aft
ernoons, ary necessary because of the 
difficulty of the music and the short 
time remaining before the concert.
The Christmas Oratorio is a mag
nificent choral work, made up of arias, 
chorals, and choruses. Us peiformance by the Bach choir, will be the 
first in several years in Pittsburgh.
Basses and tenors are still in de
mand. Mr. OBrien, conductor of the 
chorus, can use ten or twelve new 
voices in these male sections. A 
fairly good singing voice and attend
ance at rehearsals are the only re
quirements for admission to the choir.
Only half of the one thousand Stu
dent Directories printed for the TriPublications Staff were sold in the 
campus campaign of last Tuesday and 
Wednesday. As it is necessary for at 
least nine hundred to be sold before 
the issue will pay for itself, the books 
are to be put on sale again, for two 
hours, on Thursday noon.
The Tri-Publications Staff made a 
great effort this year to produce an ac
curate and good-looking Directory for 
a minimum price. In order to do this, 
the margin of profit was cut to the 
limit, and the support of the students 
was relied upon to make the issue 
financially successful.
There is no doubt that the book is 
worth more than forty cents to the 
purchaser, and few reasons can be 
found for any students refusing to 
buy one. The little volume is a great 
time-saver and a welcome boon to tho 
socially stranded. Upperclassmen 
who bought directories last year, all 
declare that they found them invalua
ble. For these reasons, it is expected

DELTA 5 CLUB IS FORMED
BY JUNIOR ARCHITECTS
The Junior Architects, feeling that 
their dignity as members of the first 
five-year course in Carnegie deserves 
the attention of the world, have or
ganized a club, which has for its in
signia a figure 5 inside a forty-five 
degree triangle. Tho organization of 
the club accounts for the apparent 
epidemic on the campus of woolen 
skull caps, adopted as official hoadgear.
If anyone wishes to affiliate himself 
with the club in spirit he may pur
chase a cap at a downtown army store 
for a nominal fee.
It is rumored that the Sophomore 
Architects, feeling a similar desire for 
distinction, may organize in a similar 
fashion.

IN SEA OF MUD
Beede and Donohoe Score on 
Long Runs; Subs Wage 
Good Battle
PA-MA DAY VOTED
A GREAT SUCCESS
Parents Visit the Various 
Departments as Guests 
of Institute
Carnegie celebrated Pa-Ma Day by 
scoring the most decisive win of the 
season against Drexel Institute. The 
final count was 45 to 0, but this does 
not begin to tell the story of the dif
ference in power between the two 
teams. The game was played under 
the worst weather conditions that 
Jupiter Pluvius could have possibly 
served. Rain began falling about three 
hours before game time, and contin
ued during the entire game. Forbes 
Field was a quagmire from one end 
to the other, except around the place 
occupied by second 'base during the 
late baseball season. A small lake 
had formed there.
However, the poor field did not pre
vent the Skibos from opening up an 
offensive that Drexel was never able 
to stop. The Philadelphians were on 
the defensive all afternoon. The had 
possession of the ball, but seven times 
during the entire game. Three times 
they received! the ball on the kick-off, 
and four times they recovered fumbles 
made by the Taitan backs. The of
fense of the Drexel team was weak. 
They made about twelve yards by line 
bucking, and lost twenty-live trying 
to run the ends. They failed to reg
ister a single first down.
Donohoe and Beebe were the high 
point scorers of tho day, each scoring 
two touchdowns. Donohoe scored first 
on a wide end run from Drexels 45- 
yard line on tho second play after 
Carnegie had received the ball in the 
first period. His attempt, at goal was 
blocked. Barr kicked off from a point 
near the sidelines, about the only 
place along the forty-yard line that 
was not under water, to Manby who 
returned) it to his forty-yard line On 
the next play Donohoe made a second 
run around left end. His interference 
was still with him when he crossed 
the gonl line, completing a sixty-yard 
run for his second touchdown in two 
minutes. Hie again failed to kick goal.
Barr again kickedi off from tho is
land near the sidelines. This time 
tho ball went to Manby on his 49-yard 
line. Using nothing but line bucks 
by McClelland and Beede, and endaround plays by Goodwin, the Tartans 
pushed the ball to tho two-yard: line. 
From here Beede had no trouble in 
plunging over for a touchdown. Dona
hue attempted score the extra point

The Freshman class of tho Univer

reputation for poor spirit, have taken 
things in their own hands. They have 
organized a Council of Fifteen to pun

Scientists representing tho Mellon 
Institute aro beginning an exhaustive 
research of sleep. Dr. H, M. Johnson 
of Ohio State University, assisted by 
George E. WoJgant, eminent psychol

conduct the study of slumbering ovor 
a period of years. An absence of any 
definite knowledge of what this panI timo is to become the basis for tho

Specially constructed beds and bed

Dr. Johnson says, "that fatigue due 
to loss of sleep Is much tho same 
fatigue produced by alcoholic drink, 
chloral hydrate, chloroform asphyxi

About a year ago, the project wa 
launched to have our Alma Mater bocome univerHaUy known a Carnugio, 
not Tech. A vigorous campaign wa 
waged and students were adjured, 
oven 'threatened, not to aay Tech. 
The roault haa been to aogrogate our 
achool from the boat of technical 
Jchoola and high achoola with which 
wo were ao apt to become eonfuaed.
hi especially Important that our 
alumni remember that wo are dlatlnctlve not only In name but in accompllahmenta aa well.
Wo occupy a unique poaltlon among 
the unlvoraltloa and collegea of the na
tion, and are continually Improving. 
Again arlsoa the question of Loyalty 
Bonda, Have you aubacrlbed for youra 
yet? Think of the poaalbllltlea 'hat 
will bo oura with an additional endow
ment of tv/elvo million dollara. Wo 
:ould truly aaplro tg bo the only 
achool of our kind, both In attain
ments and acope.
The point to be remembered la, aubscrlbo for a Loyalty Bond now for the 
'Good of Carnegie."
The Notre Dame game ia acheduled 
for next Saturday. Special accommo
dations have been arranged for which 
will'permit aa many atudentB and all 
of the alumni who desire to go with 
the team and aee the game. So If you

YOUNGSTOWN CLAN
On Monday, October 20, the Youngs
town Clan held a speeial clan meeting 
In the Y, M. C. A. at 6:30 p. m.
This meeting was well attended by 
Carnegie men from town and from the 
surrounding district. In all there 
were about twenty-five members pres
ent, The guests of the meeting were 
Bob Waddell, assistant football coach; 
Mike" Goodwfn, Capt. Beede and K. 
B. Tllbrook.
After the regular business was 
taken care of, the meeting turned to 
the thing for which it was primarily 
called. It was called to show the ap
preciation of the Youngstown Clan to 
the two Youngstown boys who have 
done so nobly on the Carnegie foot
ball team. President Hildebrand 
called on Bob Waddell for a speech. 
Bob responded by relating just what a 
great handicap our boys were under 
at all times and how they met this sit
uation. His talk was stirring and 
right to the point, and although Bob is 
not a Carnegie Alumnus, we all know 
that he is one hundred per cent for 
Carnegie. After Bob finished his talk, 
Mike Goodwin and Capt. Beede 
spoke.
And now for the climax. "Hildy 
rose and asked Mike and "Dike" to 
accept from the Youngstown Clan an 
appreciation for their splendid work 
throughout the season, a gold watch 
apiece. The boys were somewhat sur
prised as could be seen by their ex
pressions. They also were extremely 
pleased. And so everyone gave them 
"mighty hand and the meeting 
closed, everyone happy.

W.L.Hindman Proposes New 
Manufacturing Methods
W. L. Hindman, a graduate of Car
negie, has announced the working out, 
after seven years of practical experi
ence in machine-building, of a basic 
allowance and tolerance system 
based upon, definite knowledge a3 to 
values. This system 1b designed to 
meet practical requirements.
His systemuie uni-bilateral sys
temia so named because in all holes 
cut in metal for close fitting, the tol
erances are so divided that one-third 
of the tolerance ia above and twothirds are below the nominal size. 
This system embraces, in addition to 
the method of applying tolerances, a 
series of tables consisting of .basic al
lowances for different kinds of fits and 
corresponding tolerances for both 
holes and shafts. His system, Mr. 
Hindman believes, possesses inherent 
advantage that justify its universal 
adoption.
While connected with the National 
Lamp Work3, Chandler Motor Car 
Company, Maxwell Motor Company, 
Chrysler Motor Company, and PaigeDetroit Car 'Company, Mr. Hindman' 
made a general survey of the need of 
a practical system of tolerances that 
led to the development, by him, of the 
uni-bilateral system.
He believes his definite knowledge 
system has practical advantages to 
promote greater efficiency in manufac
ture of various classes of mechanism 
according to the modern inter
changeable plan of manufacturethan 
systems based purely upon personal 
judgment and experience.

arc going to be different. The Tar
tans under Wully Stoffon linvo a team 
Just as good as thut which, in 1924, 
acorod more touchdowns against the 
Horsemen than nil the other oppo

No reason why this year's aggrega

complishing what the Skibos have 
three times failed to do, and at the 
same time smash Notre' Dames ex
cellent record.
The Kiltie Band will accompany the 
rooters on the special and will be on 
hand to rouse the Carnegie fignting 
spirit and help lick the Irish at their 
own game. This is one of the biggest 
trips the Kilties have taken and it is 
partly in response to numerous re
quests from the alumni of those sec
tions that the band should be sent 
along
All in all. the trip will be a great 
adventure for those who are going. 
Not only will they see Carnegie play 
one of the greatest games in its his
tory, but they will also see many 
places of historic interest and one of 
the most beautiful universities of 
America.
Tickets are still on sale at the

PLEBES WIN FROM 
^KISKIGRIDDERS 6-0
Limric Scores Touchdown 
in Second Period 
for Plebes
The undefeated plebe team added 
another victory to its brilliant record 
by defeating Kiski 6-0, in a sea of mud 
last Saturday at Forbes Feld. The 
two teams were very evenly matched 
and the unfavorable weather condi
tions made the contest one which was 
not lacking in excitement. The only 
score of the game occurred in the sec
ond period when Capt. Limric, star 
left halfback of the freshmen, dashed 
around the Kiski left end, and after 
shaking off several tacklers, crossed 
the goal line. Harpster missed mak
ing the extra point due to the muddy 
conditions. One of the features-of the 
contest was the consistant rangy 
punting of the aforementioned
Howdy Harpster, one of the aces of 
the plebe eleven.
Kiski put up a very stubborn bat
tle, and threatened to score several 
times, but the freshmen arose to those 
occasions and promptly put suGh silly 
thoughts out of the heads of their ri
vals. The backfleld had a stone-wall 
support from the line, and were in 
most cases able to take their time in 
passing and punting. The entire list 
of linesmen performed in a way that 
would have done credit to much more 
experienced players. Melzinger and 
ivousman both distinguished them
selves at varous times.
The freshmen will meet California 
Normal in the Bowl next Saturday. 
California has an exceptionally strong 
team this year, and they number the 
W. & J. freshmen among the list of 
their victims. If the plebes are to go 
through an undefeated season they 
will have to show the best that they 
are capable of The lineup:

OUR CHANCES AGAINST NOTRE DAME
In view of the fact that the Hoosiers are not so formidable as 
they were last year, and that Carnegie presents a stronger lineup 
than it did last season, the chance for a Tartan victory appears quite 
within reason. It is true that the Four Horsemen gallop no more, 
but Rockne has developed another powerful team. Only one defeat 
has been handed to them thus far this year, and critics are unani
mous in their opinion that if the game with the Army were to take 
place at the present time, the score would be entirely different. All 
of which proves that Notre Dame is by no means an ordinary op
ponent At no previous time this season has Carnegie presented its 
strongest lineup in a major game. Unless something unforseen hap
pens this week, the entire squad will be available for use in the con
test with the Irish.
The point is that the Tartans have more than a fighting chance, 
and that with the benefit of one or two breaks, might easily emerge 
a winner.
DREXEL
That a good basket ball opponent is not necessarily a suitable com
ponent of ones football schedule, was demonstrated very effectively at 
Forbes Field last Saturday. The game told the story of a team which played 
completely out of its class, and although Drexel deserves much credit for 
the battle it put up until the.games dose, the Philadelphians were.au all 
too evident misfit But they played clean football!
CARNEGIE VS. GEORGETOWN
The Plaid cross-country outfit goes to Washington, D. C., this week
end to run Georgetown. This is the first time Carnegie has met the Wash
ington runners, and much interest is being centered on this trip. The change 
of courses may be beneficial to the Tartans. The Georgetown route is said 
to be much more level than the Sclienley Park course, and consequently 
speed will be more of a factor in the race.
The Pitt Inter-Collegiate cross-country team was defeated by the Penn 
State squad last Saturday at State College, 23-32. State has a very fast 
team this season, and has been winning consistently.
California. Normal is presenting the Plebes with one of the strongest 
lineups that they have had to face as yet. California has humbled the W. 
& J. Freshmen, who tied with the Plebes.
Lets give the team a rousing send-off to Notre Dame, they deserve it, 
for they are going out there with the purpose of winning!

by a pass to Goodwin, but the ball 
was grounded
Drexel rushed) in several substitutes 
to stem the tide of points that was 
rushing upon them, but they did no 
'better than the original lineup. Barr 
again kicked off from the sidelines. 
This time his effort carried a little 
farther, McClelland receiving the ball 
on his 15-yard line. He returned it 
to the 33-yard marker. After a line 
play, Captain Beede took the ball on 
a fake double puss.for a wide end run 
on the left side. No onn was near 
him as he swept around the line, and 
he ran 67 yards for his second touch
down. Donahue, with Beede as inter
ference, ran around right end for the 
extra point.
This brought the Sklbos points up 
to 25. Coach Steffen decided thar it 
was time to send in some substitutes. 
With seven substitutes in the lineup, 
McClelland and) Vogt pushed the ball 
down to the one-yard line. MoCelland 
then slid across the line for another 
marker. Harmon kicked goal. This 
ended the scoring for the first half.
Carneglej started tlio second half 
with almost all the. regulars on the 
sidelines. This did not prevent them 
from marching down the field for an 
other score. The march was inter
rupted several times by fumbles, but 
It wasn't long until Vogt had grabbed 
a double pass from Sebastian, and 
scampered aoross the goal line 'before 
Drexel even knew who had the ball 
Harmon again kicked goal.
The last touchdown was made in 
the fourth period, on the first play. 
This time Powrie carried tlie ball for 
an eleven yard run. I-Iarmans, kick 
hit the goal post and bounced' back 
into the field of play. Steffen now 
began sending in all the men on the 
bench. It looked as if the third team 
was going to score but the game end
ed before the ball had! been pushed 
across.
The crowd of fatners and mothers 
who attended the game were very en
thusiastic over tho way the team ran, 
waded, or swam up and down the 
field. There were about five hundred 
parents at the contest. They made al
most as much noise as the students. 
The.only part of the Pa-Ma Day pro
gram that was not a huige success was 
the special stunt the cheer leaders 
had prepared for the parents enter

the buildings on inspection trips. The 
completeness of tho equipment in all 
departments was the subject of much 
praise. Some parents seemed to have 
the idea that Carnegie was just a 
small pace, but by the time they had 
walked through the Industry building, 
cllmed down to the mine in Science, 
visited the top of tho. Arts School, 
and Inspected tho many Kitchens, din

Tho pool iu tho Carnogio gymnasium 
Is .the scene of much activity thoso 
days. The varsity and fceshmon 
swimming teams are hard at work get
ting into shape Tor tho coming soason. There seems to bo quite a bit 
of good material In school, and all in
dications point to a good year for both 
squads.
Chris Beukeiua, who Is coaching 
both varsity and freshmen candidates, 
comes from Grand Rapids, Michigan, 
having graduated from Springfiold 
College. He was captain of the swim
ming team while in school, and later 
became the coach at his Alma Mater. 
Beukema came to Carnegie last year, 
and has been working hard on tho 
prospects of a swimming team. Tills 
year sees Ills efforts materializing 
and he expects good results from the 
Tartan.pool men.
Those who are showing up well on 
the varsity include Hornbostol and 
Green divers; McGrail, Gaylor, ana 
Lithgow, breast-stroke swimmers; 
Nlmick, dash; and Ross, distaueo. 
The plebes who are fighting hard tor 
a berth include Weigant, Barnhart, 
Barto, and Armstrong; having no 
classification as yet. A manager has 
not been appointed, since no team 
from last year warrants the promotion 
of a Junior manager. However, ono 
will be namecl shortly with Mclnnis, 
McCannon, and Wilson as candidates.
The schedule Is not quite completed, 
but the tentative program calls for 
Thiel, Case, Bethany, and Wooster. 
All home meets will be held in tho 
Carnegie pool, which Is considered 
one of the finest In tho country.

read the original proposal for Pa-Ma day and 
much to our din grin it ha been carried out. To 
find that even our national flag, the emblem 
which symbolizes the very highest ideals of our 
country, which wo have ever striven to maintain 
sacred, has been cheapened on the Carnegie cam
pus to the extent of being used as a mere decora
tion, is most humiliating.
The colors have always meant a groat deal to 
us. They typified the unattainable goal, pure and 
virginal, which stood not only for the ideals of a 
mighty nation, but were also tlic inspiration of 
its greatness. To see them floating from the top 
of a mast far above the filth and sordidness of the 
earth has always created a feeling ol! reverence 
within us. And then we lower the flag to multi
ply it hundred-fold and thousand-fold so that 
every Caliban may have one to wave like any 
tawdry bit of tinsel!
This usage is but one of the marks of an un
balanced civilization developed materially far 
beyond its philosophical capacity. We strive for 
a radio in every home and mention proudly the 
population of New York, the number of cars per 
capita in California, and the 1,200 tons of soot 
per square mile which settle annually in Pitts
burgh. And consequently the flag has degenerat
ed correspondingly until it retains about the same 
significance as a guest towela piece of cloth 
reserved for special occasions.
The act is not unique in our materialistic era 
but hitherto collcgc authorities have possessed 
sufficient culture and conservative taste that they 
refrained from subjecting the flag to this indig
nity on the campus. But. now Carnegie, our Alma 
Mater, must make the initial move in advancing 
educational institutions another step toward an 
ineseapible Babbitry. Already we havo commer
cialized athletics and salariod press agents. More 
secretaries and fewer professors is the cry of 
modern education. And in the meantime we are 
becoming a nation of Philistines whoso capacity 
for abstract thought is so feeble from undernour
ishment that to prod it excites only the anathema

NOTRE DAME TRIP
GOOD LIGHT AND VENTILATION
A large portion of the Freshman class annually 
falls by the wayside and an minediato cure is de
manded. What remedial measure can bo pro
posed ?
Criticism of tho faculty is unjust as well as 
unwise. .That tho avorage candidate for a degreo 
is mentally unsuited to become an honor student 
has to bo admitted and dismissed as one ol! tho 
evils ol' our era. Scholastic requirements can not 
reasonably bo lowered and consequently but ono 
possibility for betterment romainsto reorgan
ize the student social lillo,
11 a man can bo porsuadod to study moro, porhaps ho may get through. Obviously if ho live 
in a dorm ho will sulVor few or distractions than 
:in /i imtornity; not only can rushing bo eliminat
ed but lions! dances, theater parties, and all tho 
allied oollogiato divortisoments will not display 
their sirenie allurements so soduoingly.
In the seclusion ol his cubicle ho can dovoto his 
time to study and sloop; ho will spend little 
money and have few social obligations. Tho ac
crued benefits seem so overwhelming that it is 
surprising that fraternities have not been voted 
oil the campus completely. To tho executive 
board the projected fraternity rushing rules are 
the "Open Sesame which may sunder rocks and 
reveal the trophies of learning with which tho 
majority has so long been ignorant.
But again the innate cusscdness of human na
ture intervenes. The rewards of study are slow 
in appearing and the dorm student soon finds 
many delightful occupations to replace the pro
saic text books. The seed of discontent is present 
in every human and soon our dormite seeks ex
pression through poker bouts and impromptu di
gressions into philosophy and sex psychology. 
There is no older brother to impress, the need of 
sober thought upon the plebe and study remains 
a duty which ho owes to himself only.
Tho fraternity man, 011 tho other hand, has tho 
prestige of the house to uphold. When I10 slips 
he is steadied by stronger minds. He has for his 
associates older men who teach him how to study 
efficiently and who arrange his surroundings so 
that he may study with a minimum of effort. Tho 
atmosphere is beneficial and he does not noed to 
fare forth to seek explanation of what ho does 
not understand. His superiority that of tho 
mechanic working in a modern factory over a 
brothor craftsman operating in tho establishment 
of several decades ago.
We must recognize this difference. Though 
tho fraternity man appears to skim only on tho 
surface in a mad pursuit of pleasure, still sur
prisingly often ho is imbibing fundamentals. 
And the apparently studious and thoughtful 
dorm man dabbles about, destroying energy in 
exploring byways which through his lack of ex
perience he fails to interpret usefully.
THE BARREN NICHES
The unfinished state of the Arts School niches 
has oxcited endless curiosity and speculation 011 
the campus. A few of the students, endowed 
with vivid imaginations, suggest that the archi
tect succumed to his colossal task and died a de
feated man. Others of less creative tendencies 
hold that Indiana limestone is extinct, labor 
scarce, 01* even that tlic design has been cen
sored and abandoned. The time has come when

sonse. Such a state of mind Is motivated by that oinlnont propogandlst, tho profosnlonal patriot. Tills evangOllliL Is ever present among us, soiling Amorlca to tho 
gullible, and seeking to standardize opinion.
Tho mQtliods of thoso press agents of conscrlptod 
loyalty aro oaslly followod. In tho realm of national
ism, they plead for an unreserved belief In the ultlmato 
goodness of every thing the foundors of tho republic 
thought and did. Thus was born tho ono hundred per
center, with his blind acceptanoo of all tho things which 
charaotorl'/o tho social and political life of America, 
without Inking the trouble to understand any of them. 
Thorn Is no place In this "Infallible majority" for tho 
ono who would criticize and correct. IIo will soon bocome a man without a country, If thoso offorts to 
standardize opinion and to romovo all adventure out 
of national llfo continues.
Tho activities of these vendors of drafted patriotism 
aro not conllnod to tho Hold of govornmont, but carry 
over into the arts. I havo before me accounts of Amer
ican Musical Festivals, Exhibitions of American Paint
ings, American Adaptations of tho Gothic to the Oillce 
Buildings, etc., etc., all extolling more or less mediocre 
musicians, painters and architectswith no selective 
evaluation of their workmerely because they are 
Americans. America lias 110 artistic ancestry; as a re
sult we must do the next best thing, and be good an
cestors ourselves. The only hope for the future lies in 
unbiased and fearless appraisal of present conditions. 
It is bad enough to bo honestly blind to ones faults, 
but it is folly indeed to know them and then refrain 
from acknowledgement, from fear of discouraging fu
ture efforts.
A selective sense of values is entirely removed from 
the traditional sentimental enthusiasm. Nothing is 
more futile than clieerleading from the sidelines, 01* 
whistling to keep ones spirit up, in concerns of this 
importance.

the mystery of these monumonts of thwarted abbition should bo divulged.
It was originally Mr. Hornbostels plan, in the 
designing of tho Arts building, to include five 
niches in the decorative scheme. Contrary to 
popular opinion, these roeossos have no relation 
to the words above them, but are intended to rep
resent: five types of architecture  Oriental,
Oreek, Roman, Renaissance and Medieval. The 
interior of each niche is to contain three devel
opments of the particular stylo represented.
The only alcove we are able to appreciate, even 
in its unfinished state, is the one adorned in Ren
aissance architecture. In 1913 an Italian 
sculptor turned his back on the world, and in the 
seclusion of a canvas curtain, set to work. At the 
end of a year a painful revelation was made. As 
the niche had been tilled the coffers had been 
drained proportionately, and the last of the five 
thousand dollars turned into an arabesque.
Fluids have been diverted into channels of 
more urgent need of late, in an effort to improve 
facilities for a growing student body. Until some 
benevolent Santa Claus leaves Carnegie forty 
thousand dollars, the decorative project will be 
postponed.M. IT. A.

VERY important meeting of

in the Publications Office next Monday 
at 1:00 p. 111. It is Imperative that 
all reporters, both ue-w and old, be on

the reason for their absence. The 
Tartan masthead will bo revised 111 
several weeks, and attendance at the

Summary of Dean Jewetts Report on the
Investigation of Engineering Education
"As a result of this work, many 
changes of a revolutionary character 
will be made In our schools of higher 
technical education." The Tartan 
bravely prints this statement as its 
own prediction and conviction after 
an exceedingly interesting study (with 
the kind assistance of the author) of 
the 00,000 word report on the rela
tionship of engineering education to 
industry, compiled by A. C. Jewett, 
new Dean of tho College of Industries.
Dean Jewett personally directed the 
investigation which has received so 
much puublicity in the last few 
months, as the representative of the 
National Industrial Conference Board, 
with the assistance of an illustrious 
joint committee of industrialists and 
of educators and administrators in en
gineering schools. Over a year was 
spent in the compilation of statistics.
The Tartans prediction, which at 
first seems so presumptuous, fades to 
comparative mildnesB wiien the nature 
of the National Industrial Conference 
Board is considered. The Board is a 
research organization founded to carry 
on a study of economic, industrial, and 
scientific subjects likely to be of In
terest and value to the industrial field. 
It is actively sponsored by 35 of the 
largest national manufacturers, and 
claims over 900 other industries an 
financial subscribers, so that there are 
represented, establishments employing 
six to seven million people. That, in 
effect, illustrates its scope. With such 
an organization as the instigator of 
development, educational Institutions 
are sure to respond.
The gist of the summary of Dean 
Jewett's report is presented herewith. 
The selections have been made with 
the student point of view always in 
mind.
The growth of Industry, both In voiuume and complexity, calls for more 
and .better educated men for the re
sponsible positions. For many of 
these positions, engineering education 
is the best preparation. A large ma
jority of the graduates of technical 
schools are, as a matter of fact, al 
ready engaged in other than engineer
ing positions. The purely scientific 
fields are most nearly saturated.
In the past, many men in technical 
positions were successfully trained 
without a college education. Many 
grew up with the industry and mas
tered the new methods as they were 
developed. This system is impracti
cal now, due to the vast increase in 
our scientific knowledge as a result 
of the work of the last thirty years. 
The collego trained proportion must 
increase.

"On the whole, although there is an 
abundant supply of men with the or
dinary engineering education, industry 
needs more men with a very superior 
technological education, and also men 
fitted for industries more general po
sitions in supervisory or commercial 
lines. These will find ample oppor
tunities for the profitable use of their 
training.
The selection of new engineering 
graduates for employment, and their 
induction Into industry, are both 
largely conducted by haphazard meth
ods. The large firm has an easy 
means of correcting Its mistakes in 
selection. New men may be either 
dropped, or refused promotion. As a 
result, exploitation of the young men. 
by employment of numbers in excess 
of actual needs, is resorted to by 
many firms. Careful job analysis, 
with the broadest possible interpre
tation of the fact gathered for the 
preparation of curricula, will correct 
this situation, if coupled with a greater 
care in the initial selection of em
ployees.
Even now. "Engineering graduates 
are the product of the most exacting 
series of selective tests for intelli
gence that has so far been devised. 
Whatever their faults, these young 
men are a most promising source of 
raw material for personnel organiza
tion building. The same care used in 
buying this as is used in buying other 
raw material of production should 
prove worth the effort After all, In
dustry is a human activity, and the 
human element is the most important 
one.
Industry should develop formal 
training plans for the young grad 
special courses dealing with the spe
cific qualifications for the industry he
is entering, to precede his inception as 
an active part of the firm. He should 
also receive the personal attention of 
one of the older men.
The trade associations can be most 
helpful through association and co
operation with the schools.
There are three general classes of 
criticism of the engineering graduate. 
(1) Having to do with the attitude to
wards the work and associates. (2> 
Inherent ability or aptitude for the 
kind of work undertaken. (3) Sub
ject matter included in or omitted 
from the college curricula.
As regards the graduates attitude, 
many employers state that the grad
uate overrates the value of his edu
cation, underrates the importance of 
details and practice, is unwillilng to 
work long hours, wants nought but 
white-collar jobs, has little under
standing of the practical aspects of 
the enterprise he affiliates with, and 
doesn't know how to handle himself In 
contact with common workmen In 
such a way as to command respect or 
co-operation. These criticisms are 
made continually by executives in ab
solutely unrelated industries, and by 
college grads themselves, who have 
reached impbrtant positions. Collegelife and industrial life are very dif
ferent, and the habits and attitudes 
developed in the one tend to unfit the 
grad for the other.
Industrialists have apparently al
ways expected engineering graduates, 
to be better prepared in all respectsthan they usually have been, while 
educators feel it is industrys duty totake grads as they are, and give them 
the necessary additional training. We 
need a much closer relationship be
tween colleges and industrial estaoI lishments.

HE professor continues, "Perhaps other papers 
were equally intelligent, but their merit was 
obscured by illegible penmanship. If everybody 
would learn to use a portable typewriter, it would 
save your time and mine and relieve me from the 
drudgery of reading longhand."
Neat, legible, typewritten manuscript keeps the 
"profs" in perfect "reading humor." And perfect 
"reading humor" tends to mean better marks. Then 
too, a writing machine for your personal use is 
helpful in compiling your notes, and in writing 
those letters home.
The New Remington Portable is preferred by 
students because it is the lightest, smallest, and 
most compact of all standard keyboard portables.
We will gladly show you this machine and ex
