VOL. IV, No. 6 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1909 TEN CENTS
A Matter of Discipline
It is always an unpleasant task to call public atten
tion to human weaknesses, and this is no exception. 
However, serious consideration makes it seem advis
able to put the complete facts before the student 
body, both that they may form no unjust conclusions 
and that future delinquents may realize how serious 
a matter it is to attempt to deceive and defraud ones 
fellow students, team mates and comrades.
Tech men will recall the hard, clean fight made by 
their well-trained and fine-conditioned football team 
against Western Reserve University on Saturday, 
October 16th, last. They will also recall that not only 
did their team win, but that it completed its third 
straight game without having had one second taken 
out through lack of physical condition on the part of 
any member of this remarkably gritty eleven. The 
men had held up this wonderful record because, of 
strict adherence to training rules, and not a man on 
the team but would have considered it a sad blow to 
have this proud achievement spoiled.
With this sentiment in mind the captain and coach 
together selected first substitutes for the various posi
tions on the eleven, from among those men who by 
their very acts of continuing as candidates for the 
eleven, gave assurance that they were keeping in the 
physical condition which would permit of their carry
ing on a hard contest without spoiling the clean 
record of no time taken out for lack of condition or 
stamnia.
The man selected for the important duty of being 
in readiness to jump into the game at any instant to 
fill the duty of halfback, in case of incapacity of your 
captain or other backfieldman, was W. L. Walton, a 
second year man in the A. & .T. School. This man ac
cepted the responsibility and was seated on the side 
lines in uniform, and was only prevented from get
ting into the game by the grit and endurance of the 
regulars.
On Monday, October 18th, two days after the Re
serve game, your coach walked into a students rest
room, in the A. & J. building, and caught Walton in 
the act of breaking the training rules by smoking. 
Walton evidently was aware of his clandestine act, 
as he hastely tried to hide his cigarette. In the room 
with him were three or four fellow students and 
one varsity man. At present it is considered un
necessary to publish the names of these men who 
by their presence became accesories to the act, and 
little less open to student censure.
Nothing was said by your coach at the time, but 
the following afternoon on the football field the facts 
were placed before the Varsity candidates in Wal
tons presence, and he was given an opportunity for 
explanation. His only attempt at justification was 
to state that he was smoking but three or four cigar
ettes a day. He was then told that his act of deceiv
ing his coach, captain and fellow candidates into be
lieving he was keeping in condition, to the exclusion

---------------------------------------------------

of others faithfully keeping training and accepting 
the important and hard-fought-for position of first sub
stitute, was considered dishonorable, but that he 
would be given the opportunity of redeeming him
self if he would from then on obey the training rules.
Walton has since then remained away from the 
field and all practices, without explanation to those in 
authority. This leaves but the one conclusion in the 
mind of the coaching staff, and that is, Walton must 
consider three cigarettes a day of' more value in his 
mind than the honor of Tech, the welfare of his 
teams, and his own good name. We sincerely trust 
this conclusion may prove erroneous. The matter 
is now fully before the student body.
Your coach,
E. N. SNITJER.
THE SLIDE RULEWITH EXERCISES FOR 
BEGINNERS.
(Part 2, published in last weeks number, contained 
methods of multiplication and division by the Slide 
Rule.)
MULTIPLICATION OR DIVISION BY A CON
STANT FACTOR.The slide rule is especially 
adapted to multiplying a series of numbers by the 
same factor. Only one setting of the slide is neces
sary, then the result of each multiplication can be 
read off at once. For example to multiply 24, 36 
and 48 by .707, set 1 on B scale to .707 and then 
read the various results opposite the number 24, 
36 and 48. In the form of a diagram already used.
AR .707resultresultresult
Bset 1over 24over 36| over 48
It is usually best, to save the eyes, to move the 
runner to the numbers 24, 36, etc., when reading off 
the results on the upper scale.
Division by a constant factor is likewise done by 
one setting of the slide. Divide 1 by the divisor 
and multiply the various factors by the result. For 
example to divide 24, 36 and 48 by .707, set the slide 
as shown by the following diagram.
Aat 1resultresultresult
BI set.707over 24over 36[ over 48
The numbers 24, 36 and 48 have been multiplied 
by 1 divided by .707 which is equivalent to dividing 
by .707.
Exercise 8.
Fill in the numbers in columns 2 and 3, as directed, 
using the A, B, scales, and doing one column at a 
time.

Notes to Exercise 8. If each column is done sepa
rately the time required for the fourteen calculations 
is 4 minutes. But if each number is first multiplied 
by 1.41 and then divided by 2.75, the time required 
is 6 minutes.
PART III
SQUARES AND SQUARE ROOTSThe upper 
scales of the slide rule are half the length of the 
lower scales, and are repeated. Owing to the in
creased length, the upper scales are more convenient 
for multiplying.
The position of the upper scales leads to another 
important property, the numbers are squares of the 
corresponding numbers on the lower scales. This 
is easily verified by integers 2, 3, etc., on the lower 
scale, whose squares are known. By use of the 
runner the square of any number can be read off, 
as shown in Fig. 8. Either the A, D scales or the 
C, B scales can be used.
B| 
C|
___________________D1
Figure 8. Squares.
Square roots are found by reversing the operation 
of squaring the number. Some ambiguity may arise 
because any number can be found twice on the 
upper scale, therefore two square roots may be found. 
A real difficulty arises here, namely, that the decimal 
point must be taken account of in extracting square 
roots. A simple rule can be given, based upon the 
logarithmic characteristic.
If the logarithmic characteristic is even, choose the 
number on the left side of scale: if odd, choose the 
number on the right side. This rule is also given 
in the form of a diagram, Fig. 9.

Figure 9. Square Roots.
As an example, the number 4 has a log. character
istic zero (which is considered even) and its square 
root 2 is found under 4 on the left side of the scale. 
While the number 40 (log. characteristic odd) has its 
square root 6.32 on the right side.
Further, any square may be used as a factor in 
multiplication or division, by combining the upper 
and lower scales. This is best shown by an example.

When using the C, D scales, any number on the B 
scale may be employed (which is equivalent to the 
square root of the number) for the various factors. 
It is thus nearly as easy to use the square root of a 
number as the number itself, in any fraction. Care 
must be taken, however, to choose the proper half 
of the B scale as was explained in Fig. 9. In the 
above diagram the word right or left, is added to 
the numbers on B scale to denote which end was 
taken.

Note that when any number is taken from the C 
scale, the result is the same as the square on the B 
scale. Hence it is practically just as easy to use 
the square as the number itself.

IN IMITATION OF KIPLINGS .007.
It was in the power house; the cars were in a 
talkative mood, due to the fact that they were off 
duty for a little while. ,
Well, this has been a hard day, exclaimed an 
aristocratic Fifth, Shady and Penn car as he flicked 
a fly off his roof with his trolley. Some people 
seem to think all a car is good for is to be continu
ally at their beck and call. Im tired.
Come, cheer up, Shady! Im afraid your name is 
affecting your bright disposition. Shine up your re
flector, and switch on the lights.
Its all very well to talk, when youre only a 
transfer; you dont know anything of life!
I do, too, snapped back the Murray to Shady and 
Penn car. Just because I have fifteen-minute waits 
doesnt say Im slow. I see as much of life as you 
do.
Oh, think so? superciliously raising its Pay-asYou-Enter sign. Im not stuck up, but I venture 
to say I have more experience in one run to town 
than you have in a month of Sundays.
The little car buzzed its wheels until sparks flew, 
and angrily slid the doors shut.
Now youve hurt his feelings, cried the Express 
car; That was not a kind thing to say, even if true. 
The Fifth, Shady and Penn car looked slightly 
derailed, for the Express cars were the record makers 
of the city, and were generally given first rank as 
leaders.
Why, said the Fifth, Shady and Penn car, I ran 
into a Packard machine today, and almost killed two 
men. Yesterday I registered more fares than any 
other car on the tracks. Isnt that going some?
Just then a grimy-faced, grimy-clothed man stepped 
on the Fifth, Shady and Penn car, opened the release 
clutch,but the car gave no response! The man 
swore with deep feeling and expression; the big 
cars windows rattled with consternation. The man 
hopped off, ran the little car down to the disabled 
one, coupled them, and started them out, the little 
car hauling the big, which was ready to break its 
trolley with shame.
But the other cars were considerate; when the 
Fifth, Shady and Penn car returned, there was no 
clicking of fenders, nor sly nudges with side drivers. 
The big car made a feeble apology to the little trans
fer car, and declared it would never repeat the 
offense.
Which is a question open to doubt.
Florence A. Flinn, 11.
In Assembly recently, Dean West gave a most in
teresting talk on the flags which have floated over
this country, showing pictures of the different ones 
as she went along. She aroused our patriotism at the 
start by asking us to sing The Star-Spangled Ban
ner, and by telling us a little about the author of 
the song. Very few of us, I think, knew that over 
the grave of Francis Scott Key, an American flag is 
kept always floating, and that it is never taken down 
except to replace it with a newer one.
The Red Cross flag of St. George, planted at 
Labrador by Sebastian Cabot, in T497, has the dis
tinction of being the first known flag to float over 
North America. Then, in 1620, the Pilgrims brought 
the flag known as the Kings Colors over on the May
flower, and raised it at Plymouth. The Kings Colors 
was a union between the red cross of St. George and 
the white cross of Scotland, under James I. Later, 
the flag of Cromwell and Charles II was raised over 
the colonies, but it was not accepted by the people. 
It was the cause of much dissention in the colonies, 
finally being taken down and replaced by the Pine 
Tree Flag, which from that time until the Revolu
tion remained as the accepted banner.
The first flag of American independence was 
hoisted with a salute of thirteen guns at Washing
tons headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
January 1, 1776, and was known in Great Britain as 
the thirteen rebellious stripes. This flag was adopted 
by Congress in Philadelphia, June 14, 1777, and be
came the first flag of the American Republic. Upon 
the admission of two more States, the United States 
Congress added two more stars to the flag on July
4, 1795, which custom has been followed ever since.
The pictures with which Dean West illustrated her 
talk are now on the general bulletin board for those 
who wish to examine them further. The picture of 
Francis Scott Key and his monument at Frederick, 
Maryland, and a picture of the Fort McHenry flag, 
which inspired the author of the Star-Spangled Ban
ner, are also found there. It will be worth your 
while to look at these pictures as you pass, and see 
what it was that inspired our ancestors to action so 
long ago.
The month of October has come at last;
The time when the nuts ripen thick and fast,
The frost in the field makes the pumpkins ripe,
And soon Jack OLanterns will be in sight.

Secretary Field received a letter from Kitty McMullin last week. She is helping run the Winthrop 
Normal and Industrial College at Rock Hill, South 
Carolina, and is enjoying her work very much.
Nominations and elections for officers have been 
quietly going on for the last two or three weeks 
among the Seniors and Juniors. Both classes are 
now fully organized and prepared for action.
The Seniors elected Helen Oursler president; Ruth
Doran, vice president; Edith Glenn, secretary, and
Helen Sheppard, treasurer.

The Junior election was as follows: Lureta
Kemple, president; Ethel Alter, first vice president; 
Marguerite Farrell, second, and Sara Nolin, third; 
Florence Flinn, secretary, and Mary Craighead, treas
urer.
The Glee Club held its first meeting on Thursday, 
if meeting it can be called. It was very poorly at
tended. Another meeting will be held next week, and 
all Seniors or Juniors who can sing, or think they 
can, are urged to come. We want a large Glee 
Club this year.
OUR PRESIDENTS BIRTHDAY!
Twas the seventh day of October 
And the girls of the Household Arts,
Departed from ways grim and sober 
To cheer up their serious hearts.
For this was the Presidents birthday,
And birthdays to all of us come;
So all the Arters brought presents 
To her that was past twenty-one.
Of all the beautiful presents,
I never saw equalled before.
There were diamonds, aprons, and organs 
Knick-knacks and rubbish galore.
We handed them to her with pleasure,
And laughed till our sides were all sore.
We love her-our own tiny leader,
And birthdays we wish to her more.
Gertrude Hartman, 10.
Never had a cross word 
With his little wife;
Never told a fish-lie 
In his mortal life!
Never blamed the weather
Be it rain or sun;
Never ran for office,
Though they tried to make him run!
Never in a poker game 
Was the feller found;
Never snored in meetin
When they passed the hat around.
In a world so sinful
Seemed ashamed to roam;
Bein jest so perfect
The angels called him home!
But still there were some people 
Who had the heart to say
Satan singed his feathers 
When he tried to fly away.

he saw for the first time a vested choir. To his 
mothers surprise and gratification, he not only kept

Under such weather conditions as prevailed last 
Saturday it can hardly be expected to have the stands 
filled with outsiders. That is, however, no excuse 
whatsoever for the student body not turning out very 
much better than it did. The team did not enjoy 
playing the game under such conditions any more 
than the spectators enjoyed standing in the rain 
watching them. The team did it, and did it will
ingly, not because they enjoyed it, but because it was 
their duty. In so doing they have put to lasting 
shame every student who was too timid to risk a 
little discomfiture for the sake of doing his duty.
On Saturday next we play Lehigh University in 
football for the first time since our now famous free 
football game on Schenley Oval, in the season of 
1907. The game promises to be a hard fought one 
and it is the duty of every undergraduate of Tech 
to come out and root, and root hard. The cheer lead
ers can not get you by the ears and drag you out 
any more than they can make you root when they 
get you there. It is your duty and you should be 
willing to do it without anything further being said 
upon the matter. We do not, as we have before said, 
like to advertise the fact all over the collegiate world, 
but the students have not displayed this year any
where near the spirit that they should have. We 
have a mighty good team and will winwith your 
help. It is up to YOU.
SATURDAY NIGHT IS TECH NIGHT 
AT THE NIXON. 
EVERYBODY OUT.
Saturday night will be the first Tech nght of the 
year and it is planned to make it one of the best 
nights that we have ever held. Mr. Kirke, manager 
of the Nixon, has reserved all of the boxes in his the
atre of the Lehigh and Tech football teams. He has 
also reserved a large body of seats for the Lehigh 
Alumni and the Tech undergraduates. The Tech 
tickets are in the hands of Manager Alan Bright, and 
all those who desire them can get them from him. 
The show this week, The Circus Man, is a very 
good one and everybody that comes out is assured 
of a corking good time, as all those who have at
tended Tech nights in the past can certify.
PAST OR FUTURE?
The dull season seems to be upon us. The sound 
of the grind is heard throughout the land and the 
monotonous roar and hum of it all puts many a good 
man asleep, closing his eyes to all but the printed 
page. The mathematical shark delights to force his 
cerebellum to skin-the-cat or do the giantsswing on 
the mysteries of the properties of minus Infinity, and 
the sedate namby-pamby, glad to be let alone, con
tinues his self-isolation. The buzz and clang of the 
shop and the chatter of the draughting-room descend
ed over the gayer whirl of student activities last week 
somewhat like a fog which rises from dank lands and 
blots out the happier forms of a landscape. At the 
close of the football season, such a time of all work 
and no play is the natural sequence of events, but 
such a period so early in the year is unusual and out 
of place-for several reasons.

The discussion of the problem of the plan and 
scope of education in America seems to us to be des
tined to last as long as the eternal question, Is it 
going to rain tomorrow? The time limit on the lat
ter query is an easy oneit will stop when there are 
no more tomorrows. Since the present is the mean
time, we propose to have a fling at it ourselves.
* *
When we judge exclusively by the examples here 
about us, it seems that education preparatory to col
lege standing could be grouped into two classifica
tions, and those are of the locality from which the 
possessor comes; whether city or country. We do 
not attempt any comment on what the intended re
sult in either case might have been, but base our

humble opinions on what we can see of the actual 
result after it is cut loose.
Too many of our rurally trained co-laborers, still 
possess sometimes to an absurd degree, the respect 
for, and utter confidence in anything that was in 
the book. The condition is replete with the local 
color of the isolated schoolthe back-woods school 
and its master filled with impenitrable (?) pompous 
dignity and little common sense. It is a sad blow to 
find out that type can be made the most glib and 
prolific liar of us all.
The city-raised man sees more, reads with less 
thoroughness and catches the glint o the geald at 
an earlier age. His attention is called more to things 
than print, and that means he is being taught to make 
his own bocks. The difference between the two is 
that of emphasizing what has been done in the past 
or what must be done in the future. We think an 
averaging up of extiemes would just about hit the 
sane and happy medium.

The well-rounded educationthe efficient education 
for an efficient lifeis well planned at Carnegie 
Tech. Half of it is not taught. No one can teach a 
country man how to get in student activities and no 
power but the Dean seems to be able to teach some 
city men how to stay out. Every man has got to 
mix, and this is the half untaught. Its simply up to 
you.

The first meeting of the Mechanical Draftsmen, 
night course, was held in the club room on Thursday 
evening, and the formal organization of the class 
effected.
There was a large number of men present and a 
short address was given by Mr. Leeds, after which 
the following officers were elected for the coming 
year: President, G. C. Weiss; Vice President, H. R.
Bigge; Secretary, C. E. Schoeneman; Treasurer, A. J. 
Willis, Jr.; Historian and Tartan Representative,
B. J. Patterson.
Votes were also cast for a Janitor and resulted 
in the election of Walter (Red) Nelson, although 
both Smythe and Willis gave him a run for his 
money.
The class is one of the largest in the school,- 
numbering about 75, and a great many plans are 
under way to make the meetings of the Draftsmens 
Club most attractive. Smokers, dances and theater 
parties are scheduled for the winter and a basket ball 
team will be organized. The meetings of the Drafts
mens Club will be held on 'ruesday evenings in the 
club room.
TECH TIES IN MUD-BATH CONTEST.
A muddy field robbed Tech of what should have 
been their fourth football victory this year. Morris 
kicked off for Tech and uenison got back five yards. 
Tech held for downs and Denison kicked to Hittner, 
who ran back 15 yards. Shortly after this Hittner 
got away for a long run to Denisons five-yard line.

NEXT YEARS FOOTBALL TEAM.
Your football season is now half over. Many men 
who tried for positions on your now history-making 
team, failed to win places because of lack of experi
ence and knowledge of the game, although they had 
all ether requisites necessary. Some of these men 
have quit coming cut. We can hardly blame a man, 
carrying the number of hours work required by Tech 
standards, for quitting a hopeless task when this task 
in anyway interferes with his studies. But do these 
men realize that when they get into football togs next 
September they will be no farther advanced in foot
ball knowledge and experience than they are today? 
WhUe few members of your team will graduate, it is 
scarcely probable that every other member will be 
with yeu again another season. Already your coach 
is looking around for material for next fall, giving 
it as much actual 'experience as possible. If you 
wish to have the call for a position ahead of new 
men entering Tech next year, itis advisable that you 
ccme cut for the last three weeks the rest of this 
season. The Monday following the Lehigh game 
should see a good sized squad of men on the field. By 
that time it will be possible to devote more attention 
to the individual than was possible earlier in the sea
son. Between November 1st and November 20th 
those who report will possibly learn enough foot
ball to make the Varsity in 1910.
Your coach,
E. N. SNITJER.

Last Saturday, at the football game, a bunch of 
architects were singing some of their favorite songs 
during the intermission. Some Science men standing 
near made a jeering remark to the effect that thats 
all they ever do. Poor Science men, little do they 
know of the trials and agony of charrette week!
In charrette week even Bis King stopsto woik!
Between telling jok^s and working in the office 
Jones hasnt found time to do much on his problem.
Last Wednesday the freehand drawings were 
judged for the first time this fall. A number of men 
received mention and some a first mention. The per
centage of mentions was less this judgment than last. 
This is due to the fact that the judges require each 
man to make his drawing better than the one before. 
Mr. Sparks is doing his best to make the standard 
higher. Unfortunately he has more students than he 
can take care of, so the criticisms are few and far be
tween. This does good in a way, as it throws a man 
on his own responsibility. Still, being unable to get a 
criticism often discourages a man, so another instruc
tor is really needed in freehand.
Why did Mr. Campbell wash his hands so often last 
week? Could it be because he was making out dirty 
shadow reports?
Those who are troubled with insominia will find a 
sure cure for it in the afternoon classes. For any 
proofs to that effect ask Klauss and Griffith.
This year, as usual, Mr. Campbells head gear is 
most interesting as a study in antiques!
Last Tuesday the Plebe Class in Design had a meet
ing for the purpose of getting the men together and 
attending to the cap question. H. P. Smith was 
elected chairman; D. W. Wait, vice chairman; G. A. 
Ebeling, secretary and treasurer, and M. G. Kingsley, 
chief of police.
Members of the Ways and Means Committee were: 
Rudolph, Carson, Crawford and Koler. This commit
tee are in charge of the caps, which will soon be 
heard as well as seen.
MHO CLUB.
The regular meeting of the Mho Club was held 
Friday evening. Mr. Wallace was chosen secretary 
pro tem. The Sophomore electrical class was elected 
to membership. Also the faculty members of the 
electrical department were elected honorary mem
bers.
To broaden the work of the club a motion was 
passed to invite the night men of the 5th, 4th and 3rd 
year electrical course to join the club. To make 
it more convenient for the night men to attend, the 
date of regular meeting was changed to the second 
Wednesday of each month.
A motion was passed to give Mr. Denton a vote 
of thanks for his kindness in turning over his com
mission from Elec. World subscription to the club.
The design of pins for the club was formally 
adopted and a committee appointed to procure them.
The next meeting will be held Wednesday evening, 
November 10.
After all business was transacted the remainder of 
the evening was spent in having a social time and 
in disposing of the lunch provided by the executive 
committee.
THANK YOU, WILLIAM.
Our old friend, Bill Pfouts, was again on the job

CRUCIBLE CLUB.
Mr. McIntosh, of the Metallurgical Department, 
was the speaker of the evening at the last meeting of 
the Crucible Club, which took place on Saturday, 
October 23.
Mr. McIntosh gave a very interesting talkbe
ginning by exp-osing several travelers tricks and 
continuing by tracing his journey across the conti
nent, up the coast, and through the Taku Inlet region 
of Alaska, where the trail was rather hard to trace, 
owing to its being washed out by the rain.
Alaska, Mr. McIntosh said, was a veritable sports
mans paradise. His stories of the great quantities 
and peculiar habits of the fish and game of the region 
held the attention of every one present. A num
ber of excellent photographs, depicting the rugged 
beauty of the region, were shown; none, however, 
showing the salmon-runs, or size of bears or beartracks.
Excellent refreshments were served under the 
direction of TvTessrs. Tieex and Baker, who have succeded Mr. Dot J. Felkei, former perpetual Eats 
Committee.

HAPPENINGS ELSEWHERE.
The football season at the Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute was brought to a sudden close Tuesday, 
when President Palmer C. Ricketts forbade the stu
dents to take part in any intercollegiate contest under 
penalty of expulsion. Not only are they forbidden to 
take part in intercollegiate sports, but are also ex,- 
cluded from the alumni athletic field, which was re
cently completed at great cost.
This action was taken as the result of the painting 
of some of the new institute buildings which have 
been given by Andrew Carnegie and Mrs. Russell 
Sage. The painting was done at the celebration of 
the victory of the Rensselaer Polytechnic football 
team over Saint Stephens College, which was beaten 
on Saturday by the score of 80 to 0.
New York University has started a school of 
journalism with several experienced newspaper men 
as instructors.
Hon. Judge Buffington was the speaker at Found
ers Day at Lehigh. His subject was The Call of the 
World to the College World. The Sophomores took 
all the athletic events from the Freshmen.
Last week eleven of Chicagos most famous grid
iron heroes played the varsity in a game of football. 
The field was a sea of mud but that did not deter 
the old grads from winning, the final score being 
16 to 0.
The University of Missouri has taken stringent 
measures to abolish tue practice of leaving before 
holidays. According to an edict just issued by the 
faculty, a penalty of deduction of from one to six 
hours from the student s credit will be inflcted in 
the case of any who may hereafter leave within two 
days prior to vacation time without having been 
granted permission to do so by the authorities. The 
same penalty attaches to failure on a students part 
to reappear for work within two days after the holi
days.
On October 19 Freshmen basketball men of Syra
cuse received the unusualy early call for team or
ganization from Coach J. A. R. Scott. This is the 
result of a desire to have the first year squad well 
started before the varsity men are out.
Captain Moll of the Wisconsin football team was 
restored to good standing last week, after having 
been suspended for his alleged part in a hazing 
affair. His reinstatement comes as a direct result of 
the vigorous protest made by the students and 
alumni.

ALUMNI NOTES.
L. G. Huntley, 08, sent a postal to Secretary Field 
from Equador where he is chief of party on a new 
railroad. He says that he is also teaching the army 
officers how to run the gun.
Lytle and Rigdon, 09, are starting work this week 
on the testing floor at the Westinghouse Electric 
Company.
S. S. Seiner, 09, is working in the cyanide mines 
of the Riter-Conley Company in South America.
Wallace and Ferguson, both 09, and Smucker, 08, 
are all working for the Cambria Steel in Johnstown, 
Pa.
CLUB ROOM.
At the last meeting of the club room committee, 
the members decided to make no rules at present, not 
deeming them necessary. All students are requested, 
however, to avoid rowdyism and unnecessary noise, 
and to abstain from smashing the furniture during 
periods of exhuberant spirits.
It is up to orderly students to see that these re
quests are complied with, the alternative being the 
adoption of a code of rules and the appointment of 
several good, husky bouncers to add an impression 
of dignity.
The Tartan suggests that more tables and chairs 
be placed in the club room and that the two smaller 
adjoining rooms be furnished and opened to the stu
dents, and that a piano be installed.
Last year several of the classes made liberal dona
tions to a fund, the purpose of which was to decorate 
the club room walls with a view to relieving the 
rather monotonous interior. We believe these con
tributions should be continued.
RUBBER-TANNED LEATHER.
A syndicate has established a factory in London for 
the manufacture of a new form of rubber-tanned 
leather, for which a great future is claimed. The 
leather is submitted to a tanning process of the 
chrome variety. This preserves it and then a rubber 
solution is worked into the interstices, rendering 
the hide thoroughly waterproof.
The elacticity of the rubber permits of perfect 
flexibility and extraordinary toughness, especially of 
rabbit, goat, and sheepskins. Tests have been made 
with the new leather for automobile tires, soles for 
boots and shoes, machine belting, miners boots, and 
many other articles. It is claimed that to puncture 
the leather is almost an impossibility, while the rub
ber makes it much more resilient than ordinary 
leather.Popular Mechanics.
