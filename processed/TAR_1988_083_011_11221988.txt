Supervisor proposed for fraternities
By ERIC W. LEULIETTE
Tartan Contributing Editor
On December 6 the Fraternity Housing 
Committee will recommend the creation 
of a Facilities Supervisor position to Presi
dent Richard M. Cyert, according to Stu
dent Senate Chairperson Erica Levy.
The supervisor will aid fraternity house 
managers in maintenance and upkeep of 
the 12 fraternities which have houses. 
Approximately 450 students live in this 
type of housing.
The Fraternity Housing Committee was 
created by Cyert on September 28 shortly
after he toured fraternity housing. He felt 
that the lvel of disrepair at the fraterni
ties was unacceptable.
The committee was specifically charged 
with recommending the frequency of in
spections of houses, standards of their 
upkeep, and appropriate responses when 
housing falls below standards.
The committee has met nearly every 
week since it was created.
The proposed supervisor would eventu
ally help out in every way, but first he 
would concentrate on repairs and mainte
nance, according to Levy.
The supervisor would help house managers decide what should be repaired and 
who to contact to make those repairs. He 
may also impose deadlines on a fraternity 
for having repairs made.
In addition, the committee will recom
mend that fraternities be allowed to use 
outside contractors for repairs, rather than 
Physical Plant exclusively. The supervisor 
would review contracts with non-Carnegie 
Mellon contractors.
Under this proposal, Physical Plant could 
bid against other firms for a job. When the 
houses leases come up for renewal, they 
will be rewritten to define what repairs can 
be performed by outside contractors.
The committee hopes that repairs will 
be cheaper and faster if the fraternities 
can use outside contractors.
There is a possibility that the first su
pervisor will be from Physical Plant to 
guarantee that he would have knowledge 
of the University and the fraternity sys
tem.
The committee is also considering and 
may recommend long-term solutions to 
the housing problem.
One solution, which has been backed by 
Director of Housing Anthony Martin, 
would be the eventual replacement of the 
duplexes.

Faculty Senate unanimously 
passed a motion last Thursday 
recommending that the admini
stration proceed with the implem
entation of the School of Com
puter Science (SCS) with certain 
restrictions.
An ad hoc committee formed by 
Faculty Senate, to study a pro
posal to turn the free-floating 
Computer Science Department 
into its own school, recommended 
that the full Senate support the 
introduction of the SCS.
The committee was made up of 
a member from each college, and 
they unanimously favored the es
tablishment of this separate 
school.
During the meeting last Thurs
day, Associate Professor of Chemi
cal Engineering Gregory McRae, 
a committee member, presented
a short report in the place of Com
mittee Chair Michael Levine, who 
could not attend. The report was 
a condensed version of a report, 
which, due to time constraints, 
was not ready to be presented at 
that meeting.
The report outlined concerns 
the committee felt must be ad
dressed, which they will further 
address in their full report.
One major concern was that 
the school might become isolated 
from the rest of the University 
The committee felt that if the 
school was established that it 
should remain in contact with 
the other colleges. The commit
tee report stressed that joint ap
pointments are one mechanism 
which might be used to bridge 
these gaps.
Another concern was accredi
tation. The report stated, many 
departments within the Univer
sity have requirements for
courses at the undergraduate level 
in areas traditionally covered by 
departments of computer science, 
and that it should be insured that 
the School of Computer Science 
meets the proper undergraduate 
education and program accredi
tation.
This concern stems from a re
cent accreditation report which 
states that the University is fo
cusing too much on symbolic 
computing and is not not teaching 
adequate numeric computing to. 
students.
The report also focused on the 
high ratio of special faculty to 
regular faculty. The committee 
felt that this high ratio might 
lead to a dangerous separation 
between graduate and under
graduate faculties. The report 
did not specify a solution for this 
problem; rather it recommended 
that the University further invescontinued on page 4

Affirmative action debated
RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday, The Political 
Speakers Forum, The Philosophy 
Club, and The Historical Society 
presented a debate entitled Af
firmative Action: A Black and White 
Issue?
The moderator for the event was 
Ernest Alieva, Assistant Professor 
of Philosophy. The forum consisted 
of Peter Berger and Paul Anthony 
Martin representing the pro-affirmative action cause, and Chris
topher Maloney and Tom Smith rep
resenting the opposing view.
Before the debate began, Alieva 
made a short speech outlining a few 
points of clarification. There are 
lots of things called affirmative 
action, and they all arent the same, 
stated Alieva. Lots of programs,
lots of policies, lots of projects 
that have been implemented or 
proposed have gone under the 
rubric of affirmative action, and 
I think in discussing its impor
tant to be clear.. .which ones we 
are talking about.
Alieva continued to address 
the issue of justification, stat
ing I think there are a myriad 
of arguments.... Its not the case 
that theres a simple, straight 
forward line of argument. If 
you look at the moral and po
litical theorists whove written 
on this and the range of legal 
theorists and judges whove 
made decisions on this; there 
are a variety of distinct and 
separate lines of argument. 
The format for the debate was 
impromptu, with both sides 
agreeing on four minute opening statements followed by a 
point-counterpoint debate be
tween the two constituencies, with 
each rebuttal being limited to two 
minutes.
Winning the coin toss, Berger 
and Martin opted to let the other 
side speak first, thus Tom Smith 
read from a prepared speech, 
containing his groups stance. 
While he stated that the aim of 
affirmative action was noble, he 
added that ...we cannot examine 
only how these groups affect 
minorities. We also have to look 
at what programs like these do to 
people who are non-minorities.
Smith went on to describe the 
conception of affirmative action 
programs in response to what he 
stated were the inadequacies of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, call
ing such programs seriously

flawed both morally and so
cially. Smith elaborated that 
these programs ... in and of 
themselves practiced the very 
discrimination that they were 
supposed to work against. 
Following Smiths speech, 
Paul Martin expressed his sides
feelings in support of affirmative 
action, starting with a brief his
tory of the events which led to the 
modem state of racial inequality.
Citing the famous Brown vs. 
Board of Education trial, Martin

In an attempt to slow the dramatic increase in off-campus as
saults, Campus Police have convinced the Bookstore to sell per
sonal protection and signal horns at cost to students.
The small, light-weight horns, advertised to attract attention 
and scare off would-be attackers and vicious dogs, will be sold for 
$5.95 and are capable of making noise which can be heard over 
half a mile away.
This is the kind of weapon that is not dangerous to use, said 
Campus Police Chief James LaPaglia.
Since the beginning of the semester, there have been at least six 
Carnegie Mellon students victimized by off-campus assualts. As 
a result, Campus Police have circulated fliers warning students of 
the dangers facing them and have scheduled crime-awamess 
seminars, in addition to making the horns available.

Palestinian state 
recognized by 13 
countries
NICOSIA (AP)  At least 13 
countries, mostly Arab and Mos

eration Organization, have rec
ognized the Palestinian state 
proclaimed Tuesday by the Pales
tinian National Council, while 
Palestinian groups hostile to PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat con
demned the move as a catastro
phe.
Those recognizing the state 
included Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, 
Jordan, Kuwait, Tunisia, Saudi 
Arabia, North and South Yemen, 
Malaysia, Mauritania, Turkey 
and Indonesia.
Egypt and the United Arab 
Emirates stopped short of extend
ing diplomatic recognition, but 
said they fully supported the 
move.
The declaration didnt define 
the boundaries of the new state, 
which Palestinians say should be 
determined in future negotia
tions.
In a press conference in Algiers, 
where the PNC had been meeting 
for two days, Arafat called on the 
U.S. and Israel to accept the olive 
branch implicit in his victory in 
an internal battle to win endorse
ment for a new, moderate politi
cal strategy.
In Washington, spokesmen for 
the Reagan administration 
rejected the PLO proclamation of 
an independent Palestinian state, 
asserting that the Arab-Israeli 
conflict must be settled by 
negotiations and not by unilateral

Air Force suffers 
second B-1B 
crash in nine days
RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP)A B1B bomber crashed and burned 
on a runway at Ellsworth Air 
Force Base Thursday in the sec
ond accident in nine days involv
ing one of the long-range strate
gic jets. The crew of four para
chuted to safety.
The bomber apparently clipped 
utility wires as it came in for a 
landing, said an Air Force official 
in Washington, speaking on con
dition of anonymity.
The plane, built by Rockwell 
International Corp., was on a 
routine training flight, the Air 
Force said.
The crash came two days after 
officials reported that the Air 
Force had inspected and cleared 
more than two-thirds of the 98 B1B bombers, which were grounded 
briefly following a crash Novem
ber 8 that destroyed one of the 
planes in Texas.
The crash was the fourth in the 
four years since the United States 
began flying B-l aircraft, the 
nations first new long-range 
bomber in more than 25 years.
I see no reason to believe we 
will ground the fleet. Ive talked 
to my bosses, and there is no 
intention at this time to ground 
them, Maj. Gen. Robert 
Marquette, commander of the 
12th Air Division at Ellsworth

Air Force officials ruled out any 
connection between the crashes 
Friday and November 8.

WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Reagan administration is prepar
ing a budget that will ignore many 
of President-elect George Bushs 
campaign promises by proposing 
an increase in defense spending 
of two percent after inflation and 
deep cuts in domestic spending.
The White House will have to 
submit a budget with big cuts in 
domestic programs in order to 
meet the requirements of the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. Preliminary estimates 
by the White House budget office 
project the fiscal 1990 deficit at 
$132 billion if current policies 
arent changed. The GrammRudman law requires the budget 
show a deficit of no more than 
$100 billion.
President Reagans final budget 
will propose ending some govern
ment programs and switching to 
a two-year budget cycle, the White 
House said.
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 
declined to say what programs 
are under consideration to be 
eliminated.
He said the budget would call 
for no new taxes, would not 
tamper with Social Security and 
would include a defense spending 
buildup that does more than just 
keep up with inflation. Fitzwater 
said the budget is aimed at achiev
ing a balanced budget by fiscal 
1993.
The Reagan budget will become 
the starting point for Bushs ne
gotiations with Congress. It will 
allow him to appear, in his own 
words, a kinder, gentler presi
dent by offering to trim the Re
agan defense proposal and spend 
more on his domestic priorities, 
such as education.

Search for CFA Dean continues
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Asst. News Editor
Joan Steitz, the winner 
of the 1988 Dickson Prize 
in Science, delivered a lec
ture in the Mellon Insti
tute Auditorium on Fri' day.
Speaking to a near-ca: pacity audience, Steitz 
described her work in mo
lecular biology in a lecture 
titled Lupus, Snurps, and 
Molecular Evolution. In 
contrast to her more tech, nical talk the previous day,
Steitz explained her re
search in simplified terms 
aimed at listeners with mini
mal experience in biology.
In opening her lecture, Steitz 
' noted that her work has been in 
a direction opposite to most in 
that she began with knowledge 
collected by doctors about the 
disease Lupus and used it as a 
starting point for her research. 
Steitz said that most research 
travels in the opposite direc
tion, with discoveries made in 
laboratories being used to de
velop clinical treatments.
Steitz told the audience that 
in 1976 she began investigat
ing the question of why cells 
produce ten times as much RNA 
(Ribonucleic Acid) as they need 
to produce proteins. She said 
that around this time it was

discovered that the RNA included 
large segments which did not code 
for proteins and were, in fact, 
merely random sequences of 
nucleic acids.
These segments, known as introns, must be separated from 
the expressed RNA segments 
(exons) with great precision since 
removing even one too many or 
too few links in the RNA chain 
will ruin the resulting protein.
Steitz and her colleagues used 
blood serum from patients with 
Lupus to identify Snurps (Small 
Nuclear Ribonuclear Proteins),
RNA molecules which help in the 
removal of introns from other 
RNA molecules.
Lupus is an autoimmune_ dis
ease which causes its victims to 
produce antibodies that attack the wills.
persons own proteins.
Some of the proteins at
tacked are associated with 
Snurps. Using antibodies 
isolated from Lupus pa
tients, Steitz was able to 
identify and study the 
Snurps.
After describing the pro
cedures used to study 
Snurps, Steitz explained 
what advances have been 
made in the understand
ing of how introns are re
moved from RNA and how 
the exons at either end of 
an intron are attached to 
maintain a continuous 
strand.
Steitz said that the informa
tion she has obtained about 
Snurps can, in turn, be given to 
doctors to allow them to better 
understand Lupus and other 
diseases.
Steitz has been a professor at 
the Yale University School of 
Medicine since 1970. She has 
won many prestigious awards 
in the past and is a member of 
the National Academy of Sci
ences.

Despite what critics say will 
increase competitiveness and elit

has initiated a by-invitation-only, 
cross-college honors seminar.
The seminar, University Schol
ars Seminar 99-500: Ethics, Sci

AIDS, is a full-semester, 9-unit 
course open to juniors and seniors 
from each of the Universitys 
undergraduate colleges which is 
meant to pull together CMUs 
best and brightest students.
Forty-nine students registered 
for the course. However, since the 
present seminar-format of .the 
course will only accommodate 
around 25 students, either the 
course will have to be restruc
tured or some students, probably 
juniors, will be asked to withdraw.
We didnt know when the invi
tations went out what the re
sponse would be, and Im not sure 
yet if they are going to pare [the 
enrollment! down, said Joseph 
Devine, Associate Dean of H&SS.
If the classs size is to be re
duced, the best method to do that
has not been determined yet. A 
decision will be made later this 
week, according to Assistant 
Professor of Philosophy and one 
of the seminars lecturers Ernie 
Alieva.
Over-enrollment aside, a large 
concern is whether a by-invitation-only honors program will 
increase elitism on what is al
ready a competitive campus.
According to Devine, depart
ments were allowed to use differ
ent requirements to identify their 
exceptional students. In the case 
of H&SS, the college with the 
most students presently enrolled 
in the course, Deans list-level 
students were invited to sign-up.
I feel that it is wrong to offer 
something to an elite group of 
students when there are other 
students that can benefit more. 
Open the seminar to everyone, 
but say that it will be a rigorous 
program; there are people on 
campus who dont have a 3.5 that 
would benefit just as much, if not 
more, than some of the people 
with a 3.5, said senior Industrial 
Management major Andy Robitshek.
There is a certain amount of
elitism because of the courses 
entrance criteria, but certain 
benefits will come out of the course 
for the entire campus, responded 
Devine.
Among these benefits, Devine 
aid the course would attract 
expert speakers jthat the whole 
campus could listen to aitd possi
bly sponsor a campus-wide AIDS 
symposium which could help de
termine the campus policy about 
AIDS.
While saying that he was sym
pathetic to students who feel this 
course is elitist, Alieva stressed 
that this is the first time this 
course has been offered. It , is 
important to realize that this is a 
pilot course. If there is enough 
student interest, then there 
should be similar courses for 
everyone; but in general, any kind 
of educational innovation is bet
ter than none, Alieva said.
Dan Milich, an IM senior in
vited to participate in the semi
nar, doesnt see a problem with 
the competition: Youre going to 
be competing your whole life. I 
consider the course a reward for 
the people who worked hard 
enough to get into it.
row it down to a small list.
Interviews will begin after 
this process. From this infor
mation, one outstanding can
didate will be selected and 
offered the job. Internal can
didates will be considered. 
Although, as of yet, none 
have applied.
According to Olds, a new 
dean might be selected in 
time for the 1980 fall semes
ter. Jordan predicts the 
search will be vigorous and 
views the College of Fine Arts 
as world-renowned... a jewel 
of Carnegie Mellon. We want 
our fine arts department to 
continue the momentum and 
reputation it has now  for 
which we want an outstanding 
dean.
Faculty members of the 
search committee include Le
onardo Balada, Alex Bally, 
Gordon L. Clark, James F.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  22 November 1988
CFSA protests divestment stance
; By JONATHAN LEVY
': Trtan Assistant News Editor
r*: r In conjunction with the shanty 
ri built on the Cut two weeks ago,
- othe Coalition for a Free South 
-. Africa (CFSA) held a Teach-In 
; 1 on November 14 to encourage 
ts members of the University comn9ihunity to learn more about apartP) heid.
. ,CFSA began the day with a
protest from 8 to 9 am in front of 
:- ;;the Software Engineering Insti5. i tute, the site of a Carnegie Mellon 
C ; Board of Trustees meeting.
,? 1 n CFSA is dissatisfied with Car. .negie Mellons policy of partial 
cx divestment from companies that 
vedo business in South Africa. 
cv! The Universitys policy is to 
-.riminimize its holdings in South 
Africa but retain some South 
_. African holdings, such as gifts of 
! stock in companies that have 
j South African divisions.
! Patty Heckart, a Research 
I Assistant in the Biology Depart! ment and one of the organizers of 
! ' CFSA, called this policy double 
' talk.
The Teach-In, which was held 
in room 13 of Skibo, began at 10 
am and ran until 6:30 pm.
In a flyer distributed around 
campus students were encour
aged to cut your classes, come to 
ours. Heckart said that a few 
professors cancelled their classes 
to allow students to attend the 
Teach-In. Heckart said that about 
300 students attended the Teachl? |?
*! !,!/!! tsA
In, although most did not stay the 
entire day.
Heckart conceded that the 
campaign asking people to cut 
class probably was not very suc
cessful. However, she explained 
that CFSA is a new group and is 
not yet well known on campus.
The Teach-In consisted of vid
eos about South Africa and talks 
by various people including City
photo by Thomas Nichols
This shanty was built on the Cut last week by CFSA, the same group that 
sponsored the SEI protest and the teach-in on Monday, November 14.
Councilman Jim Ferlo, Philoso
phy Department Professor Jon
athon Pressler, and Dennis Bru
tus, a former South African po
litical prisoner who now teaches 
at Pitt.
The Teach-In concluded with a 
candlelight vigil on the Cut from 
5:30 to 6:30 pm at which Brutus 
read some of his poetry.
Heckart described the TeachIn as a consciousness raising 
opportunity and a time when the 
new coalition [CFSA] could con
solidate.
Hopefully, we will go on and 
engage in a dialogue with the 
Board of Trustees about the di
vestment issue, continue to edu
cate ourselves about the diyestment issue, and, hopefully, pres
sure Carnegie Mellon into doing 
the morally responsible thing to 
do, stated Heckart
Heckart said that CFSA is plan
ning another day of class boycotts 
for next semester. That session 
will focus on divestment and 
educating students and members 
of CFSA about divestment and 
sanctions.
Debate on affirmative action held Thursday
j continued from page 1
case showed the inherent inequal
ity of racially separate institu
tions. Separate but equal, he 
said is an example of one fiction 
that worked to the disadvantage 
of a racial group for 16 years ... 
What we have to deal with today 
is... the consequences of that legal 
separation.
Martin went on to say that it 
has been nearly impossible for 
minorities to assert themselves 
in the job market, stating They 
have been psychologically re
strained, they have been legally 
restrained, they have been so
cially restrained. In order to work 
against that restraining factor ... 
there must be certain policies that 
will inject blacks into the work 
force and into the educational 
system.
Also speaking on behalf of af[A ]ffirmative ac
tion ... is not an 
attempt to make 
up for past mis
takes. 
- Ernie Alieva
firmative ac
tion, Berger 
added that 
Affirmative 
action... (and) 
the various 
programs that 
we refer to as 
collectively affirmative 
action...is an 
attempt to correct existing discrimination, not 
past discrimination. We are talk
ing about discrimination that is 
already in the current hiring pro
cedures, in the college selection 
procedures. It is not an attempt to 
make up for past mistakes. 
After the initial speeches and 
argument-rebuttal sessions, the 
two sides then fielded an exuber
ant round of questions solicited 
from the audience.
The sponsors 
noted that the 
turnout for the 
event was 
larger than had 
originally been 
anticipated, as 
was the enthu
siasm of those 
assembled. 
Because of the 
amount and 
depth of the inquiries made, the 
question and answer period of the 
debate lasted nearly an hour in 
itself, accounting for the largest 
portion of the program.
Since the issue of affirmative 
action is far more complex than 
simply a question of positive or 
negative stances, the discussion 
dissected the topic into specific 
subdivisions such as the use of 
quota systems, minority-centered
job advertisements, and various 
educational programs.
One line of questioningcentered 
on the goals of present and future 
legislation in taking measures to 
deal with the problem of racial 
inequality.
Numerous points were brought 
up with regard to the philosophi
cal perspectives and moral impli
cations of such actions.
Alieva stressed the importance 
of debates dealing with the issues 
concerning the widespread prob
lems of society as they relate to 
matters concerning campus life. 
Said Alieva, I think unless the 
people who are most immediately 
affected really sit down and do 
this hard work of trying to under
stand each other and work 
through problems and come to 
terms with each other, youre not 
going to get very far.

tigate how to solve it.
The ad hoc committee felt the 
the establishment of the SCS 
might lead to a strain on re
sources. It recommended that 
the new school follow mecha
nisms such as those followed by 
Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration and School of 
Urban and Public Affairs in
cluding the establishment of a 
separate capital campaign for 
the school.
The proposed level of admin
istrative support for the pro
gram was also a question. The
committee felt the graduate 
program is currently too large 
for the proposed level of administrative support.
There were also concerns over 
space, where the school would 
go once established. The com
mittee report offered no solu

The committee report also 
stressed that it would be meet

credit to Keith [Moore] and the 
job he did here, he added.
Athough Moore's new respon
sibilities are still being defined, 
they will include developing 
Carnegie Mellons ability to 
transmit courses to other uni

satellite. Additionally, he will be 
working on broadcast and video 
projects and on increasing the 
schools efforts in television.
These are areas which Moore,

CMU needs more space.
After the University Center, the 
present space shortage is the 
single largest problem facing the 
University, as more is continually 
being crammed into the same 
number of square feet. Carnegie 
Mellon needs to buy more land.
Wait a minute ... land? space?
Whats news about that?
Everybody knows we need more 
space, and everybody knows, 
because we live in an urban 
environment where land is a 
premium, we cant get more space.
Wrong. Dead wrong. At last 
Mondays Board of Trustees 
meeting, Vice President of 
Business Affairs Fred Rogers told 
the Trustees that the University 
has been offered two parcels of 
land on North Craig Street near 
the SEI. Unfortunately, he hadnt 
been given the go-ahead to actively 
pursue that land.
For Chrissake, why not?
Though by no means a cure for 
all the problems facing the 
University, more land would make 
a considerable difference. Here of 
the few things we would do with a 
little elbow room:
Build more classrooms. With 
more classrooms, we could have 
fewer classes during free time, 
fewer classes at night, and no 7:30 
am exams. By eliminating classes 
from certain hours of the day and 
at night, more students would be
Solving problems:
After President Cyert looks into 
a problem personally, you can bet 
solutions will be found.
This time the problem was the 
disrepair of the fraternity houses; 
the solution was the Fraternity 
Housing Committee. After meet
ing nearly weekly since Sept., the 
Copimitteeappointed by Cyert 
and made up of students, faculty, 
arid staff  recommended that 
th administration appoint a 
Facilities Supervisor to assist fra
ternity house managers maintain 
their houses.
Finally, the University has taken 
a step forward. By working with 
Greek students, at least a tempo
rary solution to a long-standing 
problem has been proposed.
Fundamentally, the University 
and the fraternities are in a 
unique, if not somewhat precari
ous, position. As a university,
CMU is responsible for the safety
free to attend lectures, games, and 
generally have more fun, 
increasing school spirit.
Expand research space. Ifmore 
off-campus space were dedicated 
to research, then more on-campus 
space could be given to students.
Consolidate and expand 
departments. The single most 
serious problem the [Computer 
Science] Department is facing is 
space. Space is not so much needed 
for future expansion, but for 
solving the shortage problem that 
has grown in recent years, Goals 
and Strategic Plans, February 
1988. Enough said.
Give more space to graduate 
students. Because the number of 
graduate students has exploded 
under the Cyert administration, 
departments have been forced to 
use trailers to house their grad 
students. Given more office space, 
the trailers could be removed and 
graduate students could actually 
have offices again.
In terms of space, land-grant 
universities clearly have an 
enormous advantage over us 
simply because they can expand 
whenever the need arises. So, to 
remain  competitive, the 
University must develop an 
aggressive program of expansion.
Expansion, as long as it is fiscally 
prudent, is nothing more than 
investing in Carnegie Mellons 
future.
: A new trend?
and well-being ofits residents. As 
a landlord, CMU must make 
money by renting its buildings to 
the fraternities.
In the case of maintenance, then, 
Carnegie Mellon dictates any 
repairs that must be made, the 
cost of those repairs, and then 
passes the bill onto the Greek 
students. Under this system, 
house residents are caught in a 
no-win situation: CMU controls 
both sides of the equation.
A Supervisor could help break 
the Universitys stranglehold over 
the fraternities. After one is ap
pointed, the fraternities will be 
allowed to bypass Physical Plant 
and accept bids from outside con
tractors, potentially reducing the 
cost of maintaining the buildings.
Its about time students and ad
ministrators came together to 
solve a problem. Lets hope this 
marks the beginning of a trend.

Editor:
After reading your editorial concern
ing the shanty in The Tartan [Shanty is 
not effective, 11/15], I felt the need to 
add some corrections, clarifications, and 
comments.
As one of the builders of the first shanty 
two years ago, I would like to thank you 
for your praise of that shanty. It was very 
effective in making the campus commu
nity more educated and aware of apart
heid. However, as one of the builders of 
the present shanty, I must criticize The 
Tartan for publishing an editorial which 
inaccurately described the new shanty 
as ineffective. It is just as effective as the 
first shanty.
Your editorials first paragraph states 
that educating people about South Af
rica is important, yet you later criticize 
CFSA for holding a Teach-in which is 
designed to do just that. You comment 
that exiled South African Dennis Brutus 
spoke at the first shanty, yet ignore that 
Dr. Brutus spoke at both the Teach-in 
and at a candle-light vigil held the same 
day. You state that with the first shanty, 
Students did not have to make as con
certed an effort to become more aware of 
the Universitys position on divestment 
and South Africa, yet you dont realize 
that any student can stop by at the presLetters to the Editor
ent shanty at any time and someone will 
be there to discuss divestment and apart
heid (and peace and religion and sex and 
music and ...) the same as at the first 
shanty.
What made the first shanty effective 
was that there was frequent discussion 
about apartheid and other political is
sues. That is also what makes the pres
ent shanty effective. In the first week of 
this years shanty:
A white South African came to the 
shanty and spoke with us, telling us that 
South African blacks are unable to gov
ern themselves because they are unedu
cated and divided into tribes which 
would fight. It was the same old pro
apartheid movement, but to those out
side the movement, the discussion was 
informative.
A Yugoslavian citizen spoke with us 
about the recent protests and the struggle 
for power between the different nation
ality groups in his country.
Students visited the shanty and dis
cussed numerous issues, not only apart
heid and divestment, but also racism, 
the military-industrial complex, God,
drugs, literature, education, and any-., 
thing else that came to mind.
The Teach-in was held, educating% 
students on South Africa, apartheid,  
divestment, homelands, and Namibia. 
Most of the time, there was standing-. 
room-only. Later the same day, a candle, 
light vigil was attended by over one , 
hundred people. ,
Lastly, I would like to correct your. 
notions of the Universitys position on , 
divestment. It is neither partial divest-; 
ment, as stated in your front-page article - 
[Shanty built to protest Apartheid, 11/ ; 
15], nor informal divestment, as stated , 
in the editorial. The University has sold 
its investments in South Africa-related . 
companies, but has not made this an 
official policy and will not rule out hav
ing such investments later (like tomor
row).
This position is a wimp posture of doing 
nothing while attempting to appease the 
campus anti-apartheid activists. We see . 
this position for what is is and will continue to push for true divestment until; 
the Trustees give up their spineless . 
avoidance of real action.

Editor:
As current president of the Coalition 
for a Free South Africa (CFSA), I feel 
obligated to correct the gross errors made 
by your paper. First, to clarify the issue 
of CFSA in relation to Students Against 
Apartheid, CFSA is Students Against 
Apartheid. The name has been changed, 
but the organization is the same. The 
name change was decided upon to repre
sent the addition of faculty and staff 
members of the campus community. The 
organization is recognized by Student 
Senate as Students Against Apartheid. 
The fact that Senate hasnt been offi
cially informed of the name change 
doesnt mean that we arent recognized. 
This was explained to your reporter who 
apparently misunderstood.
With regard to your editorial [Shanty 
is not effective, 11/15], I am appalled by 
your gross disregard of the truth and 
your failure to accept the responsibili
ties of factual journalism. In the edito
rial, you make blatant assumptions about 
the shanty. You compare this shanty to 
the shanty our organization established 
two years ago. You say that shanty un
questionably alerted some students to a
numberofimportantissues. Well, I dont 
know what you think this shanty does, 
but it has definitely alerted students, 
both to conditions in South Africa and to 
the Teach-in, which covered a wide range 
of subjects from South Africas political 
system to the position of women and 
children in South Africa.
You are so bold as to say that Dennis 
Brutus spoke about being a South Afri
can at the shanty two years ago. Well, 
you seem to have ignored the fact that 
Dennis Brutus spoke both at the Teachin and at the shanty. In fact, he spoke to 
almost 150 members of the campus 
community in a candle-light vigil on the 
Cut in front of the shanty.
You go on to say that the Teach-in will 
not attract the attention of the general 
campus community. How dare you make 
assumptions about the Teach-in, when 
no one from your organization spoke to 
either the organizer or myself. Over 200 
students came to the Teach-in through
out the day, more than had ever been at 
the old shanty. The general student body 
was offered an opportunity to learn and 
many students accepted. The blatant 
disregard of your paper for the truth
ATO and Airband not a good mix
Editor:
Last Saturday, Airband, an annual 
event, was held in the Ballroom. I sat in 
the back across the aisle from a group of 
ten to fifteen ATO brothers. I could not 
hear half of Ron Darians jokes because 
the ATO brothers were telling him to 
get on with the show, get off the stage, 
and next act.
I have to admit that the ATO costumes 
were good, but that was it. The live ver
sion of I Want to Rock and Roll All Night 
was poorly recorded, but the ATO broth
ers seated in back helped out by singing 
along. At the end of their act, the broth
ers shouted, screamed, and knocked over 
a few chairs, making quite a bit of noise. 
From my vantage point, they were the 
only people that applauded the Kiss act 
in any way, shape, or form.
After the show, I noticed that ATO was 
kind enough to leave their black and 
white make-up cream all over the floor in 
the rear of the ballroom.
The only other frat represented at 
Airband was DU. At least they had some 
style and were considerate of others who 
came to watch. They werent making 
jerks of themselves after Bing Crosby or 
Billy Idol (the two DU acts). They didnt 
sing along, drowning out the music; they 
didnt tell Ron Darian to get off the stage. 
In short they let everyone enjoy the show.
My question is directed at ATO. Why 
couldnt you guys just sit back and enjoy 
the show thus letting everyone have a 
good time?
Kevin Barney
Sophomore, Math & Tech. Writing
compromises your integrity.
A final note on your poorly researched , 
editorial and article. Dr. Cyert has never, . 
in any way, said that CMU will infor
mally divest as divestment is not infor
mal. Divestment is a policy that states 
that you will do no business with compa, 
nies involved in South Africa. President ; 
Cyert may have cleared the portfolio, but j 
as of today, there are no assurances that 
we do not hold stock in these companies 
once again.
I am very disturbed by the fact that 
your paper had the audacity to editorial
ize on an issue which it knew nothing 
about. Drop by the shanty next time 
before you make assumptions about 
whats going on. Talk to us for more than 
five minutes next time and learn whats 
going on before you are so pretentious as 
to write on it.
G. Havard Albright, Jr.
President, CFSA 
Junior, English
Ed. note: The point of the editorial was 
that the shanty was not educating the 
Carnegie Mellon community about South 
Africa as well as the shanty built two 
years ago did. Then, students made them
selves more visible and receptive to dis
cussion simply by being outside of the 
shanty, ready to talk to passersby and 
answer their questions; this time, stu
dents concealed themselves inside, mak
ing the shanty less inviting to inquiry 
and discussion, especially from strang
ers. Also, the old shanty kept a large and 
attention-grabbing list of Apartheid-re
lated facts and figures prominently dis
played outside; the recent shanty had no 
such visual information. The editorial 
was based on an extensive interview with 
Albright and personal observations of 
the shanty. The accompanying news ar
ticle was based on two interviews, one 
with Albright and one with several CFSA 
students at the shanty. Both interviews 
ran longer than 20 minutes apiece. The 
Tartan stands behind its editorial and 
its reporting.

What do we have to give thanks for?
Thursday is Thanksgiving, a 
chance to escape this campus we 
know and love for a minimum of 
five whole days. The first Thanks
giving was a celebration of the 
pilgrims good fortune, surviving 
jn the wild. Similarly, Carnegie 
Mellon students have much to 
give thanks for this year.
We can all be thankful that 
football season is finally over. No 
more football players on the Cut, 
loud temporary lights, and trips 
to Mt. Lebanon for games. We
ctually have the Cut back ------
or we will once the 
manure is absorbed into 
the ground.
We can also be thankful 
to be going to a school that 
challenges the senses as 
well as the brain. Not only
are our eyes assaulted by------
the ugly green bricks of 
Donner Hall, but now we are 
awakened every morning by the 
sounds of construction behind 
Donner and can inhale the afore
mentioned smells.
Special thanks should be given 
also to the CS department. They 
changed their minds, 15-211 wont 
be from 8:00 to 9:20 twice a week.
Inquiring Minds
Stew Levine
Instead, hackers get it 8:30 to 
9:20 three times a week. Isnt it 
nice to know that even though the 
department has no undergrads, 
it still cares enough about sopho
mores and juniors to give them 
that extra half-hour of sleep?
Graduate students are feeling
"There is nothing more 
refreshing than the brisk 
morning air of Pittsburgh 
in December...
thankful too. GSIA, a pioneer in 
business education, has discov
ered a brand new way to squeeze 
more learning into each class: 
Saturday midterms. Thats right, 
no longer do their students have 
to worry about wasting class time 
for things like tests.
The doors to Warner Hall are
finally being changed. The two 
toughest doors in creation to open 
are being replaced because they 
violate OSHA standards. Imag
ine that, the doors were unsafe; 
all this time I thought they were 
just meant to build arm strength.
Its also good to see that as we 
head into the cold months, the 
Margaret Morrison bridge is no 
more. There is nothing more re
freshing than the brisk morning 
air of Pittsburgh in December; 
the extra two minutes in it every
----- morning for Hill residents
must seem like a godsend. 
The bridges removal has 
had one other noticeable 
effect: the number of win
dows broken Saturday 
nights in the building has 
noticeably decreased.
As you can see, life really 
has been good these few 
months here at Carnegie Mellon. 
So as you sit around the Thanks
giving table, away from Americas 
most stressful university, give 
thanks for what we have, espe
cially since finals are in two weeks.

Editor for The Tartan.
Conservative? Thinking about it?
At the beginning of the present 
semester, you may remember a 
fellow Tartan columnist urging 
Carnegie Mellon students to de
fine themselves politically. He 
then went on to write an extremely 
conservative column under the 
facade of unbiased political defi
nitions of liberal and conserva
tive ideologies. This column will 
make no such attempt to be non
bias. This column is written as a 
result of continued aggravation 
caused by a shift of young people, 
such as the above-mentioned col
umnist, to the right side of the 
American political spectrum.
Why has there been a marked 
increase in conservatively outspo
ken high school, undergraduate 
and graduate students? And why 
should these students reject this 
conservatism fostered during the 
Reagan Revolution?
As a student, a young person 
should have the opportunity to be 
introduced to a multitude of new 
concepts about the world around 
us, to experiment with his own 
philosophy and own ideas, to 
develop into a mature, individual 
adult. Conservatism, by defini
tion, is reluctant to change and 
'stresses established institutions 
and established beliefs. By hold
ing back change, the Conserva
tive philosophy restrains indi
viduality and dampens the young 
persons drive to explore new ideas 
and new views of the world.
Well thats all pretty high and 
mighty. What does it tell us? If
Chuck Jainchill
the above conclusions are true 
then it is obvious that the (Conser
vative philosophy opposes the 
expressed purpose of a Univer
sity to explore new ideas and 
create dynamic, educated, inde
pendent students.
If you are unwilling to accept 
the above statements, there is 
still another reason to reject the 
conservative philosophy that may 
be festering inside. If you take a 
step back and look at this philoso
phy, Conservatism may be re
duced to inherent paranoia and 
personal greed.
Much of the Conservative 
philosophys inability to accept 
change is the inherent fear among 
its followers of new situations and 
different approaches to the prob
lems of humanity.
Why were Conservatives in the 
sixties opposed to Civil Rights? 
There was an inherent fear of 
Blacks and other minorities. The 
right could not accept the new 
idea ofhuman and political equal
ity, first voiced in the Declaration 
of Independence in 1776.
If you look at the way in which 
President Reagan was elected in 
1980, one of the keys.to his plat
form was the war on Commu
nism. Anyone who believes in a 
different economic system, an 
economic system which is in di
rect opposition to our own, must
HERBLOCKS CARTOON
'HERE'S WHERE WE START EMPHASIZIN6 THE KINPER GENTLER STUFF"
be sought out and destroyed. The 
Reagan campaign, and his early 
administration, just added fuel to 
the fear of nations and people 
who believed in different ideas 
than mainstream America.
Once.Reagan became president 
and learned to deal with the Soviet 
Union as a respected world power 
and to reject the paranoid notion 
of an evil empire, real advance 
on important world issues became 
possible. Although the fringe 
conservative elements in our gov
ernment still shiver at the thought 
of the Soviet Union as anything 
but evil, the United States people 
have accepted the Soviet people 
as humans, just like us.
Negotiations with the Soviet 
Union and its intelligent, inde
pendent minded leader have dealt 
a strong blow to classical Conser
vatism in America.
What is left of the present Con
servative philosophy is greed. If 
you ask a young conservative to 
explain his opposition to liberal
ism, invariably his opposition will 
involve money. Liberals just 
throw money at every problem is 
a very common answer.
Greed becomes apparent in 
many ways. One example is the 
recent concern over nuclear power 
plants such as Shoreham on Long 
Island, NY and Seabrook in New 
Hampshire. When these plants 
were originally proposed, there 
was little concern about public 
safety. Since that time the 
enormous safety hazard pre
sented by these facilities has been 
presented to the public. While 
those concerned with the health 
and well being of the people living 
near the power plant believe that, 
without proper safety and emer
gency plans, these sights should 
not open, Conservatives first 
concern is with the fiscal well
being of the utility company oper
ating the power plant.
Since the recent Presidential 
election, many supposed conser
vative economist have let their 
support for tax increases, along 
with spending cuts, be known. 
There has been more throwing 
money at every problem under 
the Reagan administration than 
under any other administration 
in our nations past. The differ
ence is the liberal may tax and 
spend while the Reagan Conser
vatives borrow and spend, work
ing up large expenses to be paid 
later. The young conservative does 
not seem to realize that, although 
there has been the appearance of 
prosperity over the past six years, 
the young people of America will 
have to pay the bills in the future.
If you, as a young Conservative, 
refuse to detach yourself from your 
youthful paranoia and greed, then 
maybe you should look at the 
future. You should then have a 
real fear for the safety of your 
money. For after the Reagan ad
ministration is long gone, the bills 
on our deficit will finally be due 
and we will all have to pay and 
pay heavily.
60 Coarses motives revealed
I agree with your article 
about 15-lxx. I hate the course 
and Im failing it is a comment 
made to me by one of my CSW 
students. Did you fail it also? 
She was surprised when I told 
her that I had done fine in the 
course. Why did you write your 
article then? she asked.
What could I tell her? The as
sumption that an author would 
have to be hurt by a particular 
course before he would criticize 
it is implicit in many of the com
ments I receive about 60 Coarse. 
I have been accused of venting 
[my] anger at the system, ap
parently because it has hurt 
me. This is not the reason be
hind 60 Coarse at all.
Perhaps this article should 
have been written at the begin
ning of the semester. I suppose 
that those who feel themselves 
to be attacked by the column 
deserve an explanation. Very 
well.
Attending Carnegie Mellon is 
similar to owning a Corvette. 
When it works, nothing can 
touch it; but the owner has to 
put up with a lot of rattles and 
squeaks, a lot a frustrations, a 
lack of attention to detail. When 
I came up with the idea for 60 
Coarse, I thought that it would 
be a positive method of letting 
the faculty, administrators, and 
students know when something 
was wrong so that they could 
eliminate some of the rattles 
and squeaks. I envisioned 60 
Coarse being a method of 
smoothing out the rough edges 
(hence the column being named 
after a grade of sandpaper).
60 Coarse 
Michael D.C. Drout
There are other forums for this 
type of discussion, but many  if 
not all  of them are ignored by 
the faculty and administration 
simply because they are just 
whining (the difference between 
whining and criticism is that criti
cism proposes a solution while 
whining just makes a complaint). 
I thought that The Tartan  a 
respected forum read by the whole 
campuswould have some power 
to make those criticized respond 
to the criticism, thus encouraging 
discourse on the topics in ques
tion.
The biggest success of 60 Coarse 
was the article on the curriculum 
in the Philosophy department. 
Department Head Glymour re
sponded with a thoughtful and 
courteous letter that showed his 
side of the picture. Unofficially I 
was informed that another de
partment in CMU was composing 
a response also. I was delighted. 
This is the purpose of 60 Coarse. 
When both sides of the issue are 
in the open, both parties stands 
clear, then debate and negotia
tion can ensue. Professor 
Glymours suggestion of a course 
in the History of Western Thought 
is excellent  60 Coarse hopes 
that he intends to pursue it.
I was disappointed, however, 
that the Dean of H&SS did not 
respond to the article on the core 
curriculum, that no professor or 
student responded to the article
on Special Agenda classes, and 
that those responsible did not 
step forward to defend their  
catalog and registration proce
dures.
The students of Carnegie Mel
lon want to know the purpose* : 
behind procedures  knowing , 
the why makes the university , 
seem less dark and monolithic 
and reduces the feeling of just ' 
being a cog in the research arid  
money-making machine. I'/ 
would urge those responsible; 
for procedures to give the rea
sons behind them  and 60 ' 
Coarse will continue to prompt ' 
and needle for those reasons.'
It is not the intent or purpose/ f 
of 60 Coarse to crucify (not my^- 
phrase) specific professors or de-, r 
partments. The use of names 
and specifics is only done with1 
documentation and forethought.' 
However, it will be continued, r 
because concrete details aref 
more effective and moving than 
abstract descriptions.
60 Coarse would like to thank 
those who have made it a suc
cess by responding: pro or con,* . 
angry and accusative or polite . 
and thoughtful. Responses in
dicate that the topic is one of im
portance. If you disagree with 1 
something written in 60 Coarse, . 
please reply. Your ideas may ! 
bring us closer to a solution to, 
the problem and thus an im
provement to Carnegie Mellon. 
One more bump will be sanded 
down.
Michael D.C. Drout is a jun-. 
ior. 60 Coarse will return next 
semester.
Faculty members take evaluations 
seriously: why dont students?
You are a fat ugly slob.
You are an arrogant son-of-abitch.
If I never see you again, that 
will be too soon for me. 
How would you feel if a profes
sor wrote one of those comments 
on your final paper? Disap
pointed? Perturbed? Irate? Un
successful?
Almost everybody agrees that 
rude, non-constructive comments 
like these are never appropriate. 
But professors have to deal with 
criticism like this when they read 
their faculty course evaluations 
(FCEs). According to Professor 
Ted Fenton, co-director of the 
University Teaching Center, the 
three statements above are only a 
small sample of what students 
sometime write.
As a student, you rely on ____
thoughtful comments from 
instructors to learn. But are 
you willing to extend that 
courtesy to your instructors 
so that they can learn to be 
better teachers? The FCEs 
are the only anonymous op
portunity that Carnegie 
Mellon gives you to suggest _ 
improvements in your HI 
courses; you should take full 
advantage of that opportunity to 
help make Carnegie Mellon a 
better place for everybody.
The FCE process works this 
way. After you complete a class 
FCE, it is collected with the oth
ers from that class, sealed in an 
envelope, and brought by a stu
dent to the Planning Office in 
Warner Hall. There they are 
compiled. The numerical scores 
are placed in a booklet and dis
tributed to the campus commu
nity so that students can check 
instructors ratings for future 
course selections.
Next, the original FCE forms 
are distributed to the department 
heads. They look at each 
instructors results and use them 
to help make decisions concern
ing salaries, re-appointments, 
promotions, and tenure. Finally, 
well after grades are in, the forms 
are sent to the faculty member 
who taught the course.
When I interviewed Professor 
Fenton, he told me, The best part 
of the FCEs is the written com
ments. He has plenty of evidence
Jeff Fartro
that the those comments help 
instructors become better teach
ers. I dont know of instructors 
who dont read their FCEs, Pro
fessor Fenton says.
After completing FCEs and 
talking with Professor Fenton, I 
have discovered several ways to 
give good written comments. In 
about the middle of last semester 
(Spring 88), I realized how often 
I think of ways to improve my 
courses but forget by FCE time. 
Therefore I have developed the 
habit of writing down the ideas 
when I think of them.
I keep a sheet of paper with my 
c}ass notes that I use to record my 
. thoughts. I draw a line down the
I don't know of in
structors who don't 
read their FCEs.... 
-Professor 
_______________________Ted Fenton
middle of the page and label one 
half (+) for positive ideas and 
the other half (-) for negative 
ideas. Whenever the instructor 
does something that is very use
ful for learning, I write it in the 
plus column. And when I notice 
some way of improving the course, 
I write it in the minus column. 
Throughout the semester I build 
up a list of comments from which 
I can pick and choose. Come FCE 
time, I have a healthy set of sug
gestions.
That may sound like a lot of 
extra work. Once you get the lists 
started, however, youll find out 
that it is really easy. You will see 
how fast your lists fill up and how 
many good ideas will be available 
to you when you complete FCEs.
My list got so full for one class 
last semester that I realized I 
could not write down all of my 
ideas in the ten minute time that 
I would be given at the beginning 
of class. So I volunteered to bring 
the FCEs over to Warner Hall. I 
then took the time that I needed 
after class to write my essay 
which, incidentally, filled up the
entire back of the page. I dropped 
the FCEs off after I was finished.
Before I handed the FCEs irit I 
glanced through everybodys' to 
see what they had written (I* do 
not recommend this practice).?-!; 
was amazed to see how few stu
dents wrote comments. The few 
that did write something, wrote 
something that was general in-* 
stead of specific. For example, one 
student wrote Great course ancjl 
another Good teacher, without 
explaining what made the course , 
great and the teacher good. '
People write vague comments 
like these because they dont have 
a strategy. Here are five practical 
ideas:
Think about what you want to 
say beforehand. It will help if you 
get into the habit of recording 
ideas throughout the course.
____  Dont miss class on FCE
day. Most FCEs will be done 
on December 1 and 2 this 
semester.
Dont use FCEs to verit < 
your anger. Stay away from 
inconsiderate comments. 
They only turn the instruc
tor off to the entire FCE 
system, and certainly to 
 your comments.
Give at least one comment 
directed to the instructor that will 
help him/her teach better.
 Be as specific as possible. Dont 
write, I have a hard time seeing 
things. Instead say, Tour handr 
writing is so small that I can-f 
read the board from the rear of 
the room.
Are you genuinely concerned 
about the quality of instruction at 
Carnegie Mellon, or do you just 
like to complain without doing 
your part to improve it? Why not 
take a few minutes to think of 
some constructive criticism for 
your instructors. Write your ideas 
down so that you will have them 
when you fill out FCEs.
Lets give them more comments 
on this semesters FCEs than 
theyve ever gotten. The admini
stration, department heads, arid 
professors want to improve in
struction at Carnegie Mellon. We 
do too. Lets all live up to our re
sponsibilities by making the most, 
of FCEs.

As a Portuguese student, I feel that, 
confronting diverse cultures and mixing 
different ideas can be very interesting 
and challenging for everyone, and it will 
make CMU improve and grow.
We suffer from excessive stress, an over
emphasis of grades, and apathy for nonacademic affairs, for the bargain price 
of $16,000 a year. Weve complained 
about it enough. Lets do something.
I am running for Student Senate because 
I want to help get some good things 
done (no 7:30 exams etc.) plus with five 
seats open, I figured why not.
CMU is ready for a 24 hour campus, and

15-lxx not the Angstmonger Drout thinks
Editor:
It was with great interest that I 
ijead Michael Drouts column on 
tjhe 15-lxx courses [Anxiety at
tacks in Wean Hall: 15:lxx raises 
stress levels, 11/15]. While I 
ijecognize Mr. Drouts right to blow 
off steam, I wish he had gotten his 
facts straight before he chose to 
do so. It is true that the courses 
generate anxiety. What is not 
clear is why they do and whether 
he. anxiety level is much differ
ent Jfrom that of other freshmanlfcvel courses.
! The claims in the opening para
graph concerning concrete block 
walls, tutors who dont speak 
English, software that crashes on 
a regular basis and poor grade 
distributions just dont seem to 
ring true. While we cant change 
tjhe+'basic architecture of Wean 
Hall, we have hung pictures and 
plants in an attempt to soften the 
atmosphere. I personally know of

no tutors who do not speak Eng
lish; as a matter of fact, I know of 
no other courses on campus that 
provide 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week access to tutors of 
any type! I will acknowledge that 
some tutors are better than oth
ers, but they are all quite good 
and are usually more than will
ing to help any student in the 
cluster. Although two years ago 
the software was quite crashprone, in the two years since Mr. 
Drout has taken 15-118, the soft
ware has become quite stable and 
is very much a state-of-the-art 
novice programming environ
ment. Concerning grades, for the 
spring 1988 semester, 15-111 had 
45% A, 20% B, 18% C, 3% D,

Security concerned about 
Shuttle service complaints
Editor:
I In. recent weeks questions and 
ooncems have arisen concerning 
the--operations of the Shuttle/ 
scort Service. The CMU Shuttle/ 
Escort Program was created in 
^97,9 to assure that students were 
dafly transported to their offcjampus apartments. Last year we 
safely transported over 100,000 
students and logged over 65,000 
miles. The Security Department 
oversees the whole Shuttle/Es
cort Program.
; Since Security is responsible for 
t;he operation of this important 
Service, we are concerned about 
any problems or complaints of 
our customers  the students.
! We have investigated the com
plaints that have come to our at
tention and corrective action has 
tyeen taken. Unfortunately, Secuijity is not receiving these com
plaints directly. We are hearing
about problems second-hand and 
long after a problem has occurred.
Security has a real concern 
about the Shuttle/Escort Program 
operating in a professional man
ner. We can better meet this goal 
if we hear about problems first
hand. We are inviting comments 
about our service and how we 
might better meet the'needs of 
CMU students.
The Security Department will 
be soliciting comments about the 
Shuttle/Escort Service the first 
Wednesday of every month via 
the Campaign for Great Ideas 
Program. We will have a table 
set up in the Gray Matter in Skibo 
on December 7 from noon to 2 pm. 
We hope that students will help 
us to continue improving on the 
Shuttle/Escort Service.
James J. LaPaglia 
Director of Security
judge. As far as teaching large 
programs, whats wrong with 
that? One of the best ways to 
demonstrate competence with the 
abstraction and problem-solving 
techniques taught in the course is 
through implementing large pro
grams.
With regard to the mastery 
exam, the actual exam that a 
student takes is drawn from a set 
of exams released in advance of 
the final. To mitigate against 
memorization, the actual data 
files are different from the ones 
students are given for practice. 
Nevertheless, some students in
variably memorize code in pre
paring for the exam. With few 
exceptions, such students fail 
miserably because there is just 
too much code to memorize and 
when faced with a compileor 
run-time error, they dont know 
how to debug the code. I whole
heartedly agree that memorizing 
code is a waste of a students time; 
that time would be much better 
spent writing complete (or even 
partial) solutions of various ex
ams. It is this latter experience 
that would boost the students 
confidence level attempting the 
exam.
As to the exam not measuring 
problem-solving skills, it at least 
measures the students ability to 
independently write a correct, 
fairly large program. Lest we 
forget that cheating is something 
that occurs in virtually all courses, 
the mastery is a reminder that 
you learn next to nothing by 
borrowing someone elses code. 
Problem solving is a design tech
nique; programmingis a skill that 
implements the design. Both are 
needed and both are tested 
throughout the 15-lxx courses. 
The mastery ensures that ulti
mately the students work is his 
or her own. Given the above grade 
distribution (which, by the way, 
closely parallels the grades earned
Why is ROTC getting the 
best parking spaces?
; Following is a letter sent to 
president Cyert on November 20, 
1988. A copy was submitted to 
The Tartan for publication. Ed.
>ear President Cyert,
! I would like to call your atten
tion to a disturbing change in 
parking policy which has become 
e|vident this past week. Just a few 
cjays ago several prime parking 
spaces behind Hamburg Hall were 
designated as Reserved ROTC 
Parking. Why does ROTC receive 
preferential treatment of this 
kind?
* It is understandable that there 
may be spaces around campus re
served for Physical Plant, Campjus Security, loading, or forhandiciapped people. Such restrictions 
can be justified as based on spe
cial needs or as necessary for proin other course assignments), 
students have evidently taken this 
to heart.
The entire semester rides on 
the mastery only in the sense that 
if a student fails it, that student 
fails the course (subject to retak
ing the mastery). I wonder how 
many courses assign a passing 
final grade to a student who mis
erably fails the final exam? Are 
students less anxious about other 
finals? Is it the notion of five hours 
that causes anxiety? Most stu
dents who have completed the 
labs and programs throughout the 
semester finish the exam in well 
under five hours. While it is true 
that some students use the entire 
five hours and fail, upon a subse
quent retake they generally per
form better. What other courses 
allow students to retake the fi
nal? What other courses allow 
students to schedule their final so 
as to let them choose the optimal 
time in their schedules to take 
the exam? What other courses 
essentially give students the fi
nal exam in advance so that they 
can hone their skills?
I have one final comment to 
offer both The Tartan and Mr. 
Drout. While there are some valid 
points made in the article (things 
the 15-lxx lecturers will surely 
be discussing in the coming 
months), I consider it mildly irre
sponsible to produce such a dia
tribe at this point in the semester. 
It is my opinion that the article 
itself has done at least as much to 
raise the general levels of anxiety 
in the 15-lxx courses as anything 
any of the lecturers or TAs have 
said or done over the last few 
months. In a sense, it is typical of 
the general mastery hysteria 
which certain people seem thrilled 
to promote, and that is wrong.

An old friend of mine died 
last Tuesday night...
An old friend of mine died last 
Tuesday night. The 300-foot 
radio telescope, the grandad of 
modern satellite TV dishes, 
mysteriously collapsed into a 
pile of twisted metal after a 
quarter century of observation 
of the heavens from Greenbank, 
West Virginia.
I dont know if many people 
have a favorite scientific instru
ment, but that telescope always 
fascinated me. I had visited it 
four times and looked through 
its wire mesh into the sky.
Greenbank is a small town 
near the eastern panhandle of 
West Virginia. A winding coun
try byway leads to the observa
tory and as you approach the 
facility, the 300-foot dish would 
rise majestically from behind 
rolling hills.
If you want to listen to music 
on the trip, you have to bring 
cassette tapes. Years ago Con
gress set aside the sparsely 
populated mountains around 
Greenbank and formed the 
National Radio Quiet Zone  
no radio or TV stations allowed. 
Nearly every house nearby has 
a satellite TV dish tliese days. 
Oddly enough, the big dishes of 
the observatory begat dozens of 
smaller ones.
Tourists ride around the ob
servatory in purring diesel 
buses, because a vehicle with 
spark plugs firing would dis
rupt the sensitive measure
ments of stars and galaxies light 
years away.
I rode one of those purring 
buses to the 300-foot dish as a 
counselor for the National 
Youth Science Camp last sum
mer, which was ironic in a way, 
because one of the lectures at 
camp this year was titled Why 
things fall apart.
Eric W. Leullette
The lecture was given by Mac 
Louthan, a scientist at Savan
nah National Laboratories, who 
studies engineering which fails. 
Examples are space shuttles 
which explode, skywalks in 
hotels which collapse, and jet
liners which suddenly become 
convertibles while flying over 
the ocean.
With Carnegie Mellon being 
the leading engineering and 
architecture school that it is, it 
needs to teach its engineers and 
architects what doesnt work as 
well as what does work.
From the Strategic Defense 
Initiative to solar-powered cal
culators, our society places too 
much faith in technology. Our 
engineers too often forget that 
unexpected things can go wrong.
NASA may launch a shuttle 
when its too cold. Too many 
people may pile onto a skywalk 
to dance. A plane may fly over 
the salty and corrosive Pacific 
Ocean too often.
Of course, its impossible to 
teach what some might consider 
common sense, but a university 
can impress skepticism upon 
students.
There can still be optimism 
about science and technology, 
but engineers should under
stand its true limits. Things like 
300-foot telescopes do fall apart, 
and they should be built with 
that in mind.

vision of essentia] services.
However, ROTC provides no 
essential services and I cannot 
imagine any special needs which 
ROTC may have and that other 
users of Hamburg Hall do not 
have. SUPA, EDRC, and a num
ber of university services use 
Hamburg Hall and Bureau of 
Mines B. The preferential treat
ment of ROTC is an affront to 
academic departments and uni
versity services, and such privi
lege is also a danger to the egali
tarian and collegial principles 
which a university should foster.
This change in parking policy is 
a bad precedent and a bad symbol 
of university priorities. I urge you 
to personally review the matter.

Raising money and school spirit...
The big question at the vice 
presidential debate was Is Sena
tor Dan Quayle qualified to be 
President of the United States? 
After listening carefully, I came 
to the conclusion that he is. I think 
what persuaded me was the an
swer he gave when asked what he 
would do if he were President.
He said that first of all he would 
say a prayer, then he would meet 
with Bushs people, whom he had 
gotten to know on a first name 
basis, and then hed use his con
gressional experience to be Presi
dent of the United States. This, of 
course, is a paraphrase ofQuayles 
answer to the question which he 
was asked three times.
I bought it all, even when Quayle 
compared himself to JFK.
I even fantasized the scene. 
Bush and Quayle have won the 
election. As Vice President with 
nothing to do, Quayle has been 
persuaded by his father to take a 
course in remedial law. Dan is 
preparing for a true or false test 
when a Bush aide rushes in and
Art Buchwald
says, President Bush has come 
down with a case of Mongolian flu 
and cannot function. According 
to the 25th Amendment, youre 
going to have to take over as Presi
dent.
Quayle says, This is awful, but 
fortunately, George Bush picked 
the most qualified person for the 
job. Harry Truman was the same 
age as me when he became Presi
dent.
Youre no Harry Truman. 
That was uncalled for. Well, I 
better get ready. First, I will say 
a prayer for myself and the Ameri
can people.
Thats a good idea, Mr. Presi
dent. The American people will 
need one.
Then Im going to meet with 
the Presidents Cabinet. I know 
all their names firsthand. Whats 
the name of the little guy with the 
red hair?
His name is Red sir.
Okay, lets go and talk to the 
Cabinet. Hi, Doc. Hi, Sneezy. Hi, 
Dopey. Hi, Sleepy. Hi, Grumpy. 
Hi, Bashful. Hi, Happy... You 
didnt think that Id know all your 
first names, did you? Now Ive 
called you together because the 
President has Mongolian flu and 
Im in charge. Im qualified to be 
the President of the United States 
because Ive passed the most 
important job training bill in our 
history, and I know Margaret 
Thatcher personally. Are there 
any questions?
We have an explosive situation 
in the Middle East, Mr. Presi
dent. The Iraqis and the Iranians 
want to resume fighting. And if 
that isnt bad enough, Poland is 
boiling over, Africa is being dev
astated by locusts, and Pinochet 
in Chile is rounding up the usual 
suspects again. What should we 
do, sir?
Calvin Coolidge wasnt any 
older when he faced a similar situ
ation.
With all due respect, sir, youre
not Calvin Coolidge.
That was really uncalled for.j 
What action do you want us 
take?
Im going to relate a story thafi, 
has prepared me for a moment 
such as this. I tell it at job train; 
ing centers and high schools and 
to Veterans of Foreign Wars. Mygrandmother once said to me, You' 
can do anything you want to, if) 
you just set your mind to it and gq; 
to work.
Now the Iranians and Iraqis, 
may sneer at this common-sense 
advice, and the Poles may snicker, 
and Pinochet may laugh behind 
my back, but Ill choose my grand* 
mother over them any time.
I guess that should take care of 
the problems we face today, sir. 
I am no younger than Check
ers was when he moved into th{ 
White House.
Youre no Checkers.
Will you cut that out!

Transcript of Robitsheks address to CMU Board of Trustees
following is an excerpt from 
Sjdent Government President 
Andy Robitsheks speech to the 
Qoard of Trustees, given at the 
Boards regular meeting last 
Monday, November 14. Ed. 
r I would like to speak to you 
aijout three main concerns today. 
Tliey are the University Center, 
the Human Relations Conference, 
ajn.d the fraternity housing sys
tem.
Every time I have spoken to 
yoji, I have mentioned the importapce of the new student center, 
'me number of clubs and organi
zations on campus is greatly in
creasing. Most of these organiza
tions need a room to store equip
ment, supplies, and other items. 
T]jese organizations also need 
meeting rooms. If they cant get 
their own rooms, the least they 
c.n do is have a room that many 
djfjerent organizations can use. 
Tfofe are only a few meeting 
rooms like this now and the 
demand for them is always in
creasing.
I understand the problems of 
raising money for the center, but 
students are willing to do their 
share. If it means activity fees for 
gym and pool use, we will pay it. 
The academic facilities on this 
campus are excellent; we have a 
rigorous academic program. It is 
time to take the University Cen
ter off the back-burner and make 
it one of our priorities. If it means 
putting off expanding a depart
ment, so be it; our academics are 
not going to suffer in the delay of 
new labs or equipment. The 
Center must take precedence if it 
is to be built.
The second concern is human 
relations problems on our cam
pus. Three weeks ago we had a 
conference on human relations. 
This conference was coordinated 
by students, faculty, and admin
istrators. The event was run to 
help teach others about relations 
and dealing with others who are 
different, be it racial, ethnic, sex
ual, handicapped, or some other 
difference.
Although we have not had the 
large problems that many other 
campuses have had with race riots 
or incidents of violence, we have 
had problems. Many black stu
dents met with the student af
fairs department and then with 
deans and vice presidents about 
some of their problems and con
cerns on campus. This process has 
been cooperative from all sides 
and looks to be able to be solved, 
but it shows us that we also have 
problems and need to solve them.
We need to place more impor
tance on the diversity of students 
and faculty and also bring these 
diverse peoples together so stu
dents and faculty are better ex
posed to all sorts of people. One of 
the main points brought out at 
the conference was of sensitivity 
or a lack of knowledge about other 
cultures and ideas. The commu
nication of our differences must 
be increased so we can learn from 
each other. Ignorance is not an 
excuse.
Finally the fraternity housing
system has become a major con
cern among administrators and 
students. After President Cyert 
toured the houses this year, he 
suggested that a committee look 
at ideas of how to get some of the 
houses to look better. I will be the 
first to admit that some houses 
are not clean, but this relates to a 
deeper problem: house upkeep 
and repairs. Now is the time to 
have the administration sit down 
with Greek alumni and look at 
long range plans for the future of 
the Greek system here on cam
pus. About 35% of the campus is 
Greek, myself included.
The fraternity housing situ
ation isnt going to be fixed with 
band aids and a quick repair job. 
There need to be long range goals 
so few problems will exist in the 
future.
Today I have spoken about three 
main concerns of the students 
here at Carnegie Mellon. The first, 
the University Center must be
come a priority for our campus to 
compete with the top schools in
the country. Our academic cen
ters compete head to head with 
Cornell, Princeton, and others, but 
our social center can not even 
compete in the same league. It is 
like comparing a high school foot
ball team with the Chicago Bears.
The second was the human re
lations problems. Here the Uni
versity needs to put a greater 
emphasis on diversity and on the
interaction between different 
groups.
Finally, I spoke on the frateivl 
nity housing problems which must'-, 
be included in longterm planning 
so band-aid solutions are not; 
made.
Thank you again for your time.i 
Your emphasis on these concerns, 
can help increase the college 
experience of this University.
This is the last issue of The 
Tartan for the fall semester. The 
Tartan staff wishes the Carnegie 
Mellon community a happy 
Thanksgiving and joyous holi
day season.

Scrooged is a real screamer
gy MICHAEL ROSE
fartan Diversions Editor
If youve been snoozing through 
falls crop of feature films, 
Christmas will be a godsend. 
Coming soon from Paramount is 
Scrooged, starring Bill Murray 
nd based (obviously) on Dickens 
Christmas Carol. If this film 
cant shake off those winter blues, 
nothing can.
Murray stars as Frank Cross, 
the youngest network president 
TV history. Cross IBC net
work is on the top of the ratings 
p, and Cross plans to stay there 
by producing an international 
extravaganza  Scrooge, a live 
via satellite remake of A Christ
mas Carol  to air on Christmas 
Eve. This production and its atIfendant difficulties give us our 
first insight into Frank Cross 
character. Its not very pretty.
Cross has given up his life in 
pursuit of success and takes out 
his resentment on everyone and 
everything around him. Hes 
brownnosed so much on his way 
to the top that when we first see 
him he barely notices that hes 
roveling to the chairman of the 
board. He mistreats his brother 
(James Murray, his real brother), 
liis secretary (Alfre Woodard), his 
associates, his ex-girlfriend 
(Karen Allen)in short, this guy 
is prime fodder for the Ghosts of 
Christmas tag team treatment.
Off come the kid gloves, on 
comes the ectoplasm  weve got 
ghost, folks. Cross is visited by 
"his former boss, Lew Hayward, 
who passed away on the golf 
Bourse seven years ago (John 
Forsythe). Hayward, in a mag
nificently decrepit incarnation, 
informs Cross that a) hes going to 
have to change his ways, and b) 
hes going to be visited by (you 
!guessed it) three more ghosts. 
These visitations and the way they 
interact with the ongoing produc
tion of Scrooge make up the meat 
of the movie.
In all seriousness, this is a 
dbwnright hilarious film. Bill 
Murray is at his best. This film is 
bound to invite comparisons with 
Ghostbusters by virtue of star and 
subject matter, and the last time 
Murray was as funny as he is in 
Scrooged was when he was wear
ing the khaki jumpsuit and the 
black backpack. The comedic tal
ent presented in this movie, from
photos by Timothy White, John Shannon/courtesy Paramount Pictures 
Bill Murray at his best in Paramount Pictures Scrooged. Inset: John Forsythe seems a bit under the weather.
Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christ
mas Present to Bobcat Goldthwait as IBC exec Eliot Loudermilk, is stunning. The only fault 
you might find is that at times the 
film appears almost too smooth, 
like an overproduced TV show. 
The editing is sharp, but the cuts 
seem extra slick and in some ways 
packaged  kind of An MTV 
Christmas.
This film also boasts an amaz
ing lineup of comedy cameos, from 
Robert Goulet and Lee Majors in 
network promotions to Paul Shaf
fer, David Sanborn, Larry Carlton
and Miles Davis (!). as street 
musicians performing We Three 
Kings of Orient Are. (Think about 
picking up the soundtrack album.) 
Standout performances from 
David Johansen a.k.a. Buster 
Poindexter as the Ghost of Christ
mas Past and Alfre Woodard as 
Cross long-suffering secretary 
round out the high-class cast. Also 
of note is the Ghost of Christmas 
Future  although not played by 
an individual actor, this multimedia spook was delightfully 
horrible, sort of a cross between 
Freddy Kruger and Max Head
room.
This film is not kidding around. 
Its scary and incredibly funny at 
the same time, and you could 
certainly do worse with your 
Christmas dollar. Bill Murray has 
done it again, it would seem  
and for those of you who cant get 
enough, news is that Ghostbusters 
II, original cast completely intact, 
is well into principal filming.
Scrooged, starring Bill Mur
ray, Karen Allen and Alfre Woo
dard, opens nationwide tomorrow.

After Thanksgiving the Pitts
burgh Playhouse returns to 
showing a different movie ev
ery night until we come back in 
January. This is good news to 
those who enjoy going to the 
movies every night, and bad 
news who really want to study 
for their finals.
To make it easier to decide 
we, that is my friends and I, 
have come up with a simple 
rating system. Either its worth 
missing a test for or its not. If 
the movie is really good its 
worth missing two tests.
Starting with the movies for 
those who are not leaving Pitts
burgh this weekend:
Friday, November 25: Mid
night Run stars Robert De Niro 
and Charles Grodin, as bounty 
hunter and hunted respec
tively. Grodin plays an account
ant for the mob who has em
bezzled from them and then 
jumped bail after being arrested 
for embezzlement. The Duke 
(Grodin) is supposed to be a 
midnight run for De Niros 
character who was set up by 
the same gangsters the Duke 
has stolen from. The movie goes 
from coast to coast as De Niro 
tries to bring Grodin to justice. 
Will De Niro do it? Its worth 
missing a test to find out.
Saturday November 26: The 
Big hit of the summer returns 
to Pittsburgh. Starring Tom 
Hanks as the 12 year old who 
wishes he was big and wakes 
up the next day to find himself 
in a 35 year old body. Chased 
from his home he embarks on a 
new life as an expert on toys. 
Its a bright comedy which pulls 
all the right strings. You al
ways wanted to be older when 
you were small, now you can 
find out what it was like. An
other test never gets done.
Sunday November 27: Its a 
Wonderful Life gets you into 
the Christmas mood if you 
werent already. Jimmy Ste
wart finds out what it would 
have been like if he had never 
been born. He spends Christ
mas Eve learning that he re
ally has helped his town and 
family more than he thought. 
Donna Reed and Lionel Barry
more put icing on this cake. If 
you havent seen this classic 
and youre coming back early, 
go see it in the original black 
and white.
Monday November 28: Devil 
in the Flesh stars Marusschka 
Detmers and Federico Pitzalis. 
According to the schedule its a
Sexually explicit 
examin[ing] the repercussions 
of a forbidden love affair. Its 
rated X, and if you really missed 
not having an X rated film for 
TBA, this is the night to go.
Tuesday November 29: 
Robert Redfords The Milagro 
Beanfield 
missed, but I dont plan to this 
time around. After 
with many other folks 
maybe one or two) this movie is 
a definite thumbs up. Accord
ing to one associate, it was such 
a good movie. Go see it! Funny 
when it needs to be and sad at 
other times, this movie covers 
the gamut of feelings that can 
be evoked. Go and enjoy.
Wednesday November 30: - 
Reviews from all over said that' - 
The Unbearable Lightness of< 
Being was a wonderful movie - 
and this is your time to check it 
out. Only one showing of this ; 
almost three hour movie adaption of Milan Kunderas novel' 
is scheduled for Pittsburgh. If 
you have the time and wish to 
learn about the re-awakening 
of political and sexual freedom 
in Czechoslovakia in 1968 this 
is the movie to see.
The movies in December are 
somewhat less well known to ' 
my associates and me, but here 
are our best attempts.
Tuesday December 6: Diva is 
a French film that has the best 
touches of comedy and thriller. 
Its the story of a French post
man who falls for an opera 
singer. She doesnt know he 
exists but he is enthralled with 
her and makes a bootleg of one 
of her performances. By the 
way, she never records her voice 
for any media. This just starts 
the fun. Blow off that test; it 
wasnt going to do you any good 
and this is culture!
Monday December 12: Mon
key Shines is that film they i 
were doing last year on cam
pus. George Romero directed 
this film that goes into the 
exterior of Wean Hall and ar
rives in a Mellon Institute lab. 
The only redeeming quality of 
this movie is that you can go 
and say I know where that is. 
Besides that this movie just 
isnt worth the three bucks itll 
cost. Your test would be better.
Tuesday December 13: Some , 
Like it Hot. When the mob is 
hot on your trail because youre 
a witness to the Valentines Day 
Massacre, what do you do? Join 
an all-female band. Not a prob
lem especially if youre Jack 
Lemmon and Tony Curtis. 
Yeah, its a rough life when you

As you may know, the Court of 
Common Pleas of Allegheny 
County is celebrating its bicen
tennial this year, but what can we 
possibly do to commemorate such 
a momentous occasion? Well, the 
CMU drama department has just 
the ticket. For the first two week
ends of December they will be 
collaborating with other local 
talent to bring us two new plays 
dealing with legal and political 
.issues.
The first play, By Reason of an 
Act of God, is based on a 1972 
flood that caused a coal mine 
impoundment to overflow and 
annihilate the small town of Buf
falo Creek, West Virginia. Writ
ten by Brent London (a second 
year student in CMUs graduate 
playwriting program), the play 
explores difficult choices between 
jobs and safety, loyalty and duty. 
The director, Jed Harris, is currently directing Talk Radio at the 
City Theater Company, and has^ 
taught theater and directed pro-~ 
ductions at the University of PittS^ 
burgh and the State University tP 
New York.
The following weekend bring^' 
us Dealing in Justice (A New Civil 
Rights Musical), written by Marr 
garet Kelso and Lawrence 
Hoffman. It is set in 1963 arid 
deals with a black womans legal 
struggles to enroll her son in  
white school and a white judges 
psychological struggles to come 
to the right decision about it. The  
production will be directed by Boi) 
Hoffman, an instructor in directing here at CMU.
By Reason of an Act of God will' 
be showing at 8 pm on December^ 
2 and 3; Dealing in Justice will be1 
showing at 7 pm on December 9 
and 10. All shows are in the Kresg

12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  22 November 1988
Texas is overrun by Proton-Smashing Fu
Waxahachie, Texas, which is 
right down the road from Grape
vine, just got picked as the loca
tion for the Superconducting 
: Supercollider, which they say is 
going to create 7,000 jobs,
Qr ! which is good for my cousin 
Cletis Coverdale, cause
* hes been living in 
-Waxahachie for 12 years 
and never has got a job yet.
The day after they an. nounced it, Cletis came ^ 
,;.over to ask me what the 
Superconducting Supercollider 
was, cause he might wanna take 
.a-crack at it. Fortunately, they 
were already sticking helpwanted ads in the Waxahachie 
paper asking for people who know 
how to run a Superconducting 
,, Supercollider.
. What it is, Cletis, I told him 
while he was rubbing the grease 
. off his chin and wiping it on a 
-. doily, is one of your union jobs.
- Youve got to go over to Video 
Technical Institute and sign up 
^for some refrigerator-repair 
.courses, get some kind of engi; raring training, before you can 
.work there.
, . Cletis told me how he used to 
work at the 7-11 Frozen Burrito 
Rendering Plant before they shut 
-it-down and moved to Moline, 
Illinois, and asked if they would 
transfer his papers. 
e. Cletis! Goldangit, listen to me! 
,, .This is an entirely different thing! 
v ,This is a scientific installation. It 
. doesnt have nothing to do with 
rrefrigeration and/or conveniencestore products. This is something 
the entire Texas congressional 
delegation has been sneaking 
around Washington trying to get 
,_for five years. Now listen up and 
! Ill tell you how it works.
I didnt realize, said Cletis,
 looking sheepish. All them doz
ens of Congressmen, huh? 
Full-time cheating, too, I told 
him. This is a BIG deal. And, by 
the way Cletis, get a haircut, you 
look sheepish. All right, heres
; he Bob Goes iio The Drive-In
the way it works. Your Supercon
ducting Supercollider has got two 
aspects. One, your superconduc
tor. Thats self-explanatory. 
Thats where you take a conduc
tor, like a piece of copper wire 
thats been frazzled on one end so 
you can hot-wire the TV set to 
pick up NFL games when theyre 
blacked out. And then its not just 
a conductor, from the Latin con, 
meaning with, and ductor, 
meaning ductor. No, its a 
SUPERconductor. So it means a 
passel of copper wire the size of 
Sears Tower.
Okay, thats the first part. The 
second part is your Supercollider. 
And heres where you come in, 
Cletis. You know what theyre 
going to do?
What? said Cletis.
Theyre going to build a 53- 
mile tunnel in a circle in 
Waxahachie.
Good idea, said CletisT 
Why is it a good idea?
Ive thought of building a tun
nel under Waxahachie my 
ownself. I had a dream about it 
the other night.
Like I say, sometimes Cletis 
took a little STP Oil Treatment in 
his Ovaltine.
And then once they get the 
tunnel built, I told Cletis, theyre 
gonna fire some protons around
there till they collide, and you 
know what thatll do?
Sounds like itll probly repro
duce the first half second of the 
beginning of the universe, repli
cating the Big Bang in a 
controlled environment, 
and creating a measure
ment for units of matter 
smaller than man has ever 
witnessed, guessed at, or 
known about before this 
time.
Howd you know that? 
I asked Cletis.
Read it in the want ads in the 
Waxahachie paper.
Well, thats probably a job you 
have to have TRAINING for. So
I do believe Id enjoy that, and 
it also fits with my personal life 
fulfillment life plan.
And one more thing, Cletis. 
Yeah?
Let me know EXACTLY which 
day yall plan to turn that thing 
on.
Okey doke.

Its never been difficult for students to con
vince their parents of the need for a Macintosh 
computer at school.
Persuading them to write the check, however, 
is another thing altogether.
Which is why Apple created the Student Loanto-Own Program. An ingenious loan program 
that makes buying a Macintosh as easy as using 
one.
Simply pick up an application at the location 
listed below, or call 800-831-IDAN. All 
your parents need to do is fill it out,
sign it, and send it. If they qualify, theyll receive 
a check for you in just a few weeks.
Theres no collateral. No need to prove finan
cial hardship. No application fee.
Best of all, the loan payments can be spread 
over as many as 10 years.
Which gives you and your parents plenty of 
time to decide just who pays for it all.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  22 November 198813

Tartan Staffwriter
Pittsburghs premier improvisational comedy troupe 
is making a comeback. On 
Wednesday, November 30th, 
The Lemming Project will re
claim their stage at J. 
Hannas in Oakland. The 
return marks the end of a two 
month hiatus for the Lem
mings, during which time 
they sharpened up their 
improvisation skills and 
wrote a shows worth of new 
material.
The Lemming Project has 
been the citys number one 
improv troupe since its 
humble beginning at Graffiti 
in 1986. It should be noted 
that they are still Pittsburghs 
best improv troupe, primar
ily by virtue of the fact that they 
are Pittsburghs only professional 
improv troupe. The current cast 
of the Lemmings is composed of 
Lamont Arnold, Paul Anderson, 
Bill Dalzell, John Paul Thomas, 
and Doug Pona. Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus Mark Levine was also a 
member of the group during this 
past summer until he flew off to 
L.A. to pursue a career in screenwriting.
Over the summer, the Lemming 
Project performed weekly at J. 
Hannas and did a radio comedy 
show on WYEP. Both projects 
were put on hold for various rea
sons, including Dalzells involve
ment with City Theatres Talk 
Radio, and Thomas wedding. 
This brief repose forced the Lem
mings underground to root out 
new material. Now they are ready 
to emerge into the light again,
with new and hopefully cou
rageous improv, according to 
Arnold.
In addition to the fresh 
sketches and empowered im
prov, the Lemming Project is 
retaining some of their great
est hits, like Lemming Aid, 
Ponas rendition of Colo
rado, and a ballad from the 
National Lampoon show, 
Lemmings. No coincidence 
there, kids. Wednesdays 
show will be one of many fu
ture J. Hannas appearances 
for the Lemming Project.
The Lemming Project will 
be at J. Hannas, 114 Atwood 
St. in Oakland, on Wednes
day, Nov. 30 at 10 pm. Cover 
charge is $4. It might be a 
good idea to call the club and 
see if theyll let you in (under 
21).

I suppose eventually it had to 
. happen - someone whose musical 
- opinions I greatly respect voicing 
i ^an opinion directly opposite those 
! I expressed in my column. I must 
; admit that the experience 
I almost blew me over, espe
cially considering how 
 smooth the sailing had 
Lbeen for almost a semester 
Las a critic. The review in 
- question was a negative one 
uof course, people are less 
Ljikely to disagree with compli|,;_ments) and not one, but two of my 
[, favorite professors thought that 
I the program was a much better 
f one than I had given credit for. 
L Thankfully, there were others in 
[ the audience who agreed with the 
review (opinion) and helped cush| ion the fall.
In any case, a virtual blaze of 
I thought was sparked by the disI agreement, and caused me to take 
a step back to rediscover my origi[nai intent as a critic. Back in 
September I had two goals: to 
present a good balance between 
previews and reviews (the former 
actually being more important), 
and to write better reviews than
II had seen in the past, not only in 
The Tartan but in other local 
papers. As to balance...witness 
five reviews last week and none
| this week. As to better, let me be 
I more specific. The ideal critique 
of a musical performance should 
I not simply be a play-by-play 
I account of the action; it needs to 
I take into account the technique, 
I the expression, and most imporI tantly in my reviews, the commuI nicative abilities of the performE ers. Needless to say, other factors
such as the context of the per
formance and the history of the 
music also can play important 
roles as well. In addition, the 
review must have a mixed audi
ence in mind: it should be read
able by the lay person (non-musi
cian), but it should also say some
thing interesting to those who 
know the subject well.
The problem then wasnt so 
much in my intent as in my execu
tion. When one of the professors 
discussed the subject with me 
later, he said that his only prob
lem with the review was the idea 
that I hadnt backed up my opin
ion enough with specifics. Mea 
culpa. I let myself be influenced 
by that fact that the performance 
was a personal disappointment 
and didnt take enough time to 
say why. Precisely because the 
critics critics are less likely to 
disagree with a compliment, the 
critic himself must remember 
always to justify his less-thancompliments. My apologies for 
not being specific enough in criti
cism (but not for criticizing).
I said something about balance 
before so heres the week ahead in 
Pittsburghs classical music:
Tuesday evening the Carnegie 
Mellon Contemporary Ensemble 
(Leonardo Balada, director) will 
present works of student compos
ers at 8 pm in the Alumni Concert
Hall, College of Fine Arts. Those 
represented by premiere perform
ances on the program include 
David Bruno, Chris Buchenholz, 
Steve Ledbetter, Mark Snyder, 
and Mariana Villanueva. 
Admission is free.
For those of us stuck in 
Pittsburgh over Thanks
giving (or you natives that 
have nothing better to do) 
the Pittsburgh Symphony 
does have a subscription 
set of concerts this weekend. A 
program of all-20th century music 
will feature the Pittsburgh pre
miere of two works - Boris 
Blachers Variations on a Theme 
by Niccolo Paganini and Henri 
Dutilleuxs Tout un monde 
lointain... (A whole world away) 
for Cello and Orchestra. PSO 
principal cellist Anne Martindale 
Williams will be soloist in the 
second work. Rounding out the 
program will be the 1911 version 
ofStravinskysPeirowc/i&a. Lorin 
Maazel will conduct the concerts 
which will take place Friday at 
8:30, Saturday at 8 and Sunday 
at 2:30. Call 392-4900 for tickets.
Lastly, Rodef Shaloms cham
ber music series with Steven 
Starkman and Friends presents 
a program entitled Novelties of 
the Romantic Period Monday, 
November 28 at 8:15 in the J. 
Leonard Levy Hall at Rodef Sha
lom Synagogue. The concert will 
feature series director Steven 
Starkman, PSO concertmaster 
Andres Cardenes, Isaias 
Zelkowicz and Ralph Zitterbart 
in works of Rolla, Dvorak, and 
Moskowski; the program is free 
to the public.

Double Nickles on the Dime, 
Minutemen. The group doesnt 
exist as such any moreD. Boon, 
their guitarist and main vocalist, 
died in a car crash, and the rest of 
the band has reformed as Fire

considered to be one of the all 
time best examples of how good. 
punk rock can be. Fifty-five songs 
are squished into four sides, in
cluding a couple of Van Halen

antidote for any skate-punk who 
thinks punk rock begins and ends

early new wave scene, featuring 
live tunes by everyone from the

to Gary Numan to Gang Of Four 
to Joan Jett. There have been a 
few trends under the bridge since 
its release in 1981, but the album 
provides a good look at new wave 
in its heyday.

artists. As much as Urgh! is a 
look back, these three LPs are a 
good look around at whats going 
on right now. All three cover dif
ferent generalities of the alterna
tive music scene - The Wailing 
Ultimate covers the rock part of 
the post-punk wasteland, while 
SubPop 100 looks at the stranger 
and more threateningmusics, and 
Lonely Is An Eyesore covers the 
4AD/Cocteau Twins genre favored 
by those who wear black, among 
others. Any one of these would be 
a good start for a new waif, and all 
three would be an even better gift

PDC presents AUTOBAHN
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
The Pittsburgh Dance Council 
will present the final program in 
its Modem Masters Series when 
the Adaptors/Movement Theatre 
perform their work AUTOBAHN.
The Adaptors/Movement The
atre is the creation of Kari Margo
lis and Tony Brown. They met 
twelve years ago in France while 
studying with renowned Parisian 
mime, Etienne DeCroux. They 
joined forces and spent several 
years performing and touring with 
the mime troupe Omnibus. They 
eventually settled in New York 
and founded their own school of 
' dance.
Ladies and Gentlemen, fasten 
your seatbelts; you are about to 
enter onto the AUTOBAHN. Like 
the West German speedway of 
the same name, AUTOBAHN 
takes a look at life in the fast lane, 
sweeping you through a potpourri 
of impressions from our recent 
past and our uncertain future. 
That is the Theatres description 
of AUTOBAHN, a work that 
combines dance, original music, 
mime, and video.
" After viewing the piece, Alan 
M. Kriegsman of the Washington
Post noted, It would be hard to 
exaggerate the virtuosity of the 
performers and the production as 
a whole. It is one of the zaniest, 
most brilliantly innovative and 
incisively probing stage pieces of 
recent times...For all its multimedia extravagance, its intimate 
in scale and swift in development. 
In a recent interview with the 
New York Times, Margolis com
mented on her companys style. 
Instead of beginning with a 
script, we begin with choreogra
phy. Ultimately, we would like to 
develop ourselves into superac
tors who can do whatever it takes
 sing, dance, move and speak 
to communicate in the best way. 
Margolis and Brown have been 
recognized with fellowships from 
the Dance and Theater Depart
ments of the N ational Endowment 
for the Arts, a choreography fel
lowship from the New York Foun
dation of the Arts, and a Bessie, 
the New York Dance and Per
formance Award.
AUTOBAHN will be presented 
at the Stephen Foster Theatre in 
Oakland on December 2 and 3 at 
8 pm, and also on December 4 at 
1 pm. For tickets and informa
tion, call the Pittsburgh Dance 
Council at (412) 355-0330.
Final exhibitions for the semester...
Tesla and Yu showing at Forbes
By JULIETTE BORDA
Tartan Staffwriter
Liz Tesla led me through 
Doherty Halls lower intestines 
to her workspace in the 
sub-basement, between 
glassblowing and rabbit 
experimentation. Hav
ing seen an installation 
of Lizs a few weeks ago,
I was sure that the big, 
tar-lined styrofoam tray 
at the base of the stairs 
was hers. Liz, a senior 
sculpture major, ex
plained that for her installation 
at the Forbes Gallery, she would 
complete the piece by filling it 
with a few inches of water and 
loading the box a foot or two 
high with Wonder Bread. This 
box will be displayed with one of 
identical proportions (about 6" 
deep and 3 feet square or so), 
constructed of wood.
Found objects play a large role 
in Lizs sculptures, since, she 
says, their spirit comes out in 
new contexts. Nxt week, a 
large, stout barrel-like piece of 
pipe will be shown encompass
ing a column coated in an un
usual material; unlike the styro
foam piece, I wont ruin the sur
prise for you. The theme of the 
encompassing square and circle
are, for Liz, universal symbols of 
mans soul and his surroundings. 
A few weeks back, Liz showed an 
installation in the Ellis Gallery, 
3rd floor of CFA, that again made 
use of a found object in combina
tion with talc, which flowed 
through a hole in the square ob
ject and created a circle of white 
powder on the floor about four 
feet beneath the raised structure. 
It had a beautiful, awkward aes
thetic that Liz discovered and put 
to use in her piece.
Sharing the track lights next 
week at the Forbes Gallery will be
David Yu, a senior drawing ma
jor. Davids works dont tend to 
be as radical as Lizs, but they 
unquestionably command the 
same level of curiosity and awe. 
Davids figurative 
drawings and paintings 
show the sort of knowl
edge of the human form 
that one imagines 
DaVinci had. His draw
ings, packed with fig
ures, send puzzling 
clues about their mean
ing, but David claims 
that his works are a 
means through which to study 
formalistic issues such as color 
placement and the composition 
offorms. His compositions deal 
with antiquity  the conven
tional roles played by men and 
women.
Davids finished figurative 
drawings bear a striking resem
blance to early Picassos, with 
their thick legs and puffy fin
gers. David agrees that Picasso 
has a lot to offer, even though 
he is not a prime source of refer
ence. David greatly admires the

Im Not Rappaport, by Carne
gie Mellon alumnus Herb Gard
ner, opened November 16 at the 
Pittsburgh Public Theater and 
will continue its run through the 
holiday season until December 
18. David S. Howard and Samuel 
E. Wright, as Nat and Midge, the 
plays main characters, gave
exile on Long Island or to move 
into a home for the elderly which 
Nat calls abortion at the other 
end. Midge, who has worked for 
forty years as the maintenance 
man in an apartment building, is 
hoping that he can hold on to his 
job. He is then fired by Danforth, 
the young yuppie president of the 
co-op organization who is plan
ning to install an automatic and 
more efficient maintenance systhe actual star. He effectively 
brought to surface the conflicting 
complexity of Nats character, 
from his lying and sensational 
stories to his touching sincerity 
and kindness.
Midge, played by Samuel E. 
Wright, was an equally convinc
ing character. Wright portrayed 
Midges outer weakness which 
was countered with his strong 
inner will and his conviction that

strong performances which were tem.
enhanced by a creative set design Through his characterizations 
and the use of musical selections of Nat and Midge, Gardner makes 
but undermined by weaker pera comment about the oppression 
formances from other members of of the old that is forthright and 
the cast. demanding. On the other hand,
Im Not Rappaport follows the by emphasizing the humorous 
routinized lives of two elderly elements of the play, the Public
men. Nat, a white man, and 
Midge, a black man, spend their 
time sitting on a park bench in 
Central Park. Nat recounts sen
sational stories about his past life 
as a spy, while Midge listens 
skeptically. The men both endure 
the pain of being cast aside from 
society. Nats daughter wants him 
to move from New York City to
Theaters production is entertain
ing rather than preachy. The play 
inspires reactions of revulsion and 
sympathy but most of all laugh
ter in its portrayal of the dispos
sessed of society.
David S. Howard, as Nat, was 
superb. It is difficult to believe 
that he was the understudy to the 
part on Broadway rather than
he would not be broken through 
the callous insensitivity of the 
members of the younger genera
tion.
Although Howard and Wright 
gave exceptional performances, 
the other cast members did not 
bring the same amount of energy 
to their roles and seemed selfconscious and almost awkward 
on stage. Michael Kelly Boone, as 
the Irish punk Gilley, kept slip
ping back and forth between an 
Irish and a New York accent. The 
Cowboy (John Hall) had similar 
problems with his Texas drawl 
and Susan J. Coon, a senior act
ing major at CMU, didnt seem
quite ready for the performance'
Despite these flawed perform
ances, the plays message and the 
superb acting of Wright ar$ 
Howard definitely make it worfji 
seeing. According to Gardn^-, 
miserable oppression can be tran
scended through fantasy and se^- 
reliance rather than submitting 
to the painful restrictions of socir 
ety. The plays themes of frien^ 
ship and kindness transcending 
oppression make it a perfect pieipg 
for the holiday season, inspijjpjg 
children of all ages to listen,,^ 
their graindparents stories witji 
interest rather than to think/qf 
the elderly as incompetent -anfl 
unimportant burdens. r*

Tartuffe is a wily opportunist who 
invades a couples home. Through 
trickery and deception he tries to

passionate love affairs encom
passes all walks of Italian life.
Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro

College is fun when youre only four years old
By JENNI BOURQUE 1 experience for CMU and Chatham sBy JENNIBOURQUE
Tartan Staffwriter
It is 10 am.
At the Child Care Center, located in 
Morewood, children are busily involved 
in an activity that teaches the relation
ship between family and Thanksgiving. 
Across campus, in Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie Hall, children at the Childrens 
School are busily working on a project 
that stresses the theme of Pilgrims and 
Indians.
Although both centers emphasize 
growth and development of the children, 
the Child Care Center and the Chil
drens School were created independ
ently for different purposes.
The Child Care Center
The Child Care Center opened in Sep
tember of 1971 primarily to serve the 
needs of CMU faculty and staff members 
who needed an extension of hours in 
their childs pre-school day. For parents 
with very young children, the Infant 
Toddler Center of Squirrel Hill was cre
ated as a part of the Child Care Center. 
It is not located on campus because of a 
lack of space.
Yet, as Dr. Marsha Poster, director of 
the Child Care Center since 1974, is 
quick to point out, Weve developed our 
own definition of what a quality early 
childhood education with extended hours 
is all about. Licensed by the State De
partment of Public Welfare and the De
partment of Education Board of Aca
demic Education Schools, the Child Care 
Center, which is open from 7:15 am to 6 
pm Monday through Friday, structures 
pre-school and kindergarten activities 
throughout a day that includes a pro
gram offering developmentally appro
priate activities. During this time, ap
proximately 95 children who regularly 
attend the Child Care Center are divided 
by age into four groups, which are then 
broken down even further. Each day the 
children are taught something new; each 
story, activity, and discussion is based 
upon a developmentally appropriate cur
riculum. Teachers at the Child Care
(Mg SI
ABOVE: Evan Jarvik, 4, isnt stifling a 
yawn like most CMU students.
Center have at least four-year degrees in 
fields of early childhood education, child 
development, or elementary education.
Like the Childrens School, the Child 
Care Center is a training site for early 
childhood professionals and offers its 
facility for research into early childhood 
development. Parents are kept abreast 
of all activities by comprehensive 
monthly activity plans.
The Child Care Center has strived to 
give the children a learning experience 
that goes beyond the definition of basic 
child care. It was recognized two years 
ago when it was accredited by the Na
tional Academy of Early Childhood Pro
grams. This national accrediting system 
was set up to help parents identify highquality day care programs. There are 
only ten other early childhood programs 
in the state with such accreditation.
The Childrens School
The Childrens School, directed by Dr. 
Ann Baldwin Taylor, similarly focuses 
on the development of its approximately 
95 children, yet it also concentrates on 
observational research in the area of 
child development. The Childrens School 
is a part of CMUs psychology depart
ment; it acts as a field laboratory for both 
psychologists and 
student research
ers as well as pro
viding hands-on
experience for CMU and Chatham sti 
dents enrolled in the teacher educatic 
program; after leaving the Children 
School, the older students are certified j 
early childhood development.
Parents receive a detailed explanatk 
of each project their child is involved i 
and are encouraged to ask questioi 
about any aspect of the research they < 
not understand. Taylor explains th; 
being a part of a research environmei 
is a positive experience for the chil 
because the child enjoys the special a 
tention and one-to-one contact with tl 
researcher. The childs research expei 
ence is smoothly incorporated into tl 
rest of his or her day. The specially de 
ignated research rooms connect with tl 
larger rooms in Margaret Morrison wi1 
which the children are already familii 
and comfortable.
The Childrens School has two tw 
and-a-half hour sessions for the thre> 
and four-year-old groups. Kindergartei 
age children are the only ones who sts 
throughout the day from 9 am to 3 pir
The teachers at the Childrens Schoc 
all of whom are qualified with degrees i 
elementary or early childhood educi 
tion, are currently concentrating o 
implementing a new program at th 
school named DASH. DASH, whic 
stands for Developmental Approach* 
in Science and Health, is a nation* 
consortium of university and scho< 
groups created to develop an integrate 
science, health, and technology currici 
lum for elementary school students. Th 
curriculum includes hands-on activitic 
and group sharing.
As a part of DASH, the Children 
School is working with two public schoi 
systems in the Mon Valley  the Elizi 
beth Forward School District and tl 
California School District  in an a 
tempt to bring knowledge of childhoo 
development to the public sector. Th 
schools are linked electronically vi 
BITNET.
Both Dr. Taylor of the Childrens Scho< 
and Dr. Poster of the Child Care Cent 
place great emphasis on parent-teache 
communication. Although their pri 
grams exist for different purposes, the 
both believe that keeping parents awar 
of childrens activities and progress i 
important to the childens intellectual 
social, and physical development.

. At Northern Illinois University, 
cool kids dont join the John 
Lennon Society.
With their long hair and tie- "dyed shirts, the Lennonists are 
-th campus oddballs. They talk of 
scial change and student activism. But few of their peers are 
'listening. A lot of students look 
at the John Lennon Society as a
' bnch of freaks, says student 
Samantha Leidner.
I am eating dinner in De Kalb 
with 40 NIU honor students. As 
an advice columnist who makes 
house calls, I find myself dining 
in' all sorts of environments. I 
thought a student dorm would be 
familiar terrain: Im just eight 
years out of college. I never ex
pected so pronounced a genera
tion gap.
Ted Manning, a resident assis
tant on one of the co-ed honors 
floors, had invited me. He wrote 
about the fine cuisine and promised that no matter which day I 
came, there will be Jell-0. The 
food, I find, is pretty bad, but 
there is indeed Jell-O. Flavor of 
the day: green.
One thing I discover very 
quickly is that these students 
(ages 17 to 20) have strong opin
ions about baby boomers (age 24 
to 42). Im tired of reading about 
them, says Ted. Every time you 
turn around, the media are re
porting, Baby boomers turned 
40 yesterday, or Baby boomers 
are getting married, or Now 
theyre getting divorced, or 
Theyre all going shopping. 
For many students, the term 
baby boomer applies to their 
parents. For others, boomers are 
their older siblings. They cer
tainly dont identify with us. But 
they do have sharp advice for us: 
Enough already!
They appreciated an article 
that appeared a while back in 
the Chicago Reader. Some of us 
are not part of your baby boom, 
post-boomer Julie Phillips wrote. 
We really dont care what you 
were doing the day Kennedy was 
shot. We dont want to know how 
you watched the war on TV, or 
how you wished youd been at 
Woodstock. We are sick of hear
ing about you, tired of reading 
about you, and bored senseless 
by your self-absorbed prattle. In
short, we are Boomed Out!
I try to tell these students that 
I clearly remember when John 
Kennedy was shot, even though 
I was in kindergarten. We dont 
care! two students yell out in 
unison. They dont have the same 
reverence for the big events of 
their early years. Yeah, we have 
memories of Watergate, 
Michaelle Cummings says. 
Bozo wasnt on.
They dont seem to regret that 
their generation lacks a spokes
man, a Lennon or a Bob Dylan. 
We have Tiffany, someone says 
and everyone laughs.
Weve all read about how to
days students dont want to save 
the world. Theyd prefer an MBA 
and a piece of the action. These 
students dont deny this. Why 
arent they fighting injustice? 
There doesnt seem to be any
thing left to protest, says Jon 
Sundberg.
In fact, aside from the pet 
causes of the tiny Lennon Soci
ety, the few sparks of campus 
activism at NIY tend to be nar
rowly focused on safe issues, 
such as cuts in the states educa
tion budget. Says Michaelle: 
People dont want to get in 
trouble anymore.
Not all of them are proud of 
this. Students in the 60s had 
the guts to say what they thought
was wrong, says Russ Talley. 
We dont. And they sometimes 
question their disdain for the 
Lennon Society. We laugh at 
them, but were not doing any
thing, and they are, says Shan
non Fitzgerald.
Still, they define baby boom
ers as self-centered and idealis
tic and themselves as self-centered in a realistic way. Their 
view of the protest era: The 
majority of students today think 
it was a waste of time, says 
Russ. In the 60s, they smoked 
pot, grew their hair long, and 
didnt really accomplish any
thing.
The students also doubt that 
all 60s students were activists. 
There must have been a lot of 
people who never got involved
 people like we are now, one 
student says.
Meanwhile, Russ says he has 
a clear view of the future. And 
like it or not, he says, hes tired 
of the baby boom: Well be pay
ing your Social Security.
Only the green Jell-0 seems 
familiar.

. On a campus filled with bright 
and talented students it seems 
, that there can never be enough 
clubs, organizations, or awards to 
honor the call to excellence. Car.negie Mellon has dozens of honor
societies, all with specific require
ments and definitions, yet last 
spring, Scott Kane, Area Coordi
nator for Mudge and Oakland/ 
Shadyside, decided to see if there 
was room for one more organiza
tion which could be targeted at 
helpingfreshmen succeed at their 
first year at college.
Kane had been a member of 
Phi Eta Sigma when he was in 
college and thought there might 
be some interest on the CMU 
campus to begin a chapter. He 
sent out letters in spring of 1988 
to all freshmen who had QPAs of 
3.5 or better in the first semes
ter of their freshmen year. This
procedure is very similar to the 
Rituals and Selection process of 
Lambda Sigma, a sophomore 
honor society; however, Kanes 
idea was merely to make an 
inquiry into how many fresh
men were actually interested.

CMU plans holiday bash 
with Madrigal Dinner 88
By STEVE PETERS
Tartan Staffwriter
Fine food and entertainment, a 
chance to escape a hectic campus 
to the simpler medieval life of the 
16th century. Escape, if you will, 
to the court of a King and Queen 
who will feast with you on good 
roast beef and thrill you with ex
cellent jugglers and bellydancers. 
A mere six dollars apiece will 
provide you and your friends a 
repast to surpass your expecta
tions.
The theme of the Madrigal 
Dinner is medieval, of course. This 
years incarnation will include 
musicians, medieval decorations, 
jugglers, bellydancers, snakecharmers, the CMU Chamber 
Choir, and even a King and Queen 
presiding over the whole event.
Why should you want to spend 
money on this? In the words of 
Anne Witchner from Student 
Affairs, I wanted to make some
thing festive and fun for campus. 
Its just supposed to be different 
and fun. Madrigal Dinners are 
popular at other schools as well, 
but according to Witchner some 
charge $25 or more.
The word madrigal deals with 
music and lyric poetry, just as the 
Madrigal Dinner does. Musicians 
with medieval instruments will 
play throughout dinner. I 
couldnt have done it without the 
help of the Music Department, 
commented Witchner. Students 
from the Music department will 
be on hand to perform, along with 
other students who will juggle 
and cavort. Not all the perform
ers are students, however.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  22 November 1988L3
Wolfe relates experience, gives advice
! By TERENCE SPIES
I Tartan Staffwriter
The imagination is powerless 
against tomorrows news
; Phillip Roths lament for the novel was 
; the basis of Tom Wolfes lecture about 
; the American realistic novel. Wolfe enI tertained a nearly-full Skibo Ballroom 
I with his observations on subjects rang' ing from The New York Honk to vice in 
| the 80s.
; Wolfe opened his lecture with a recol| lection of his days as a newspaper re[ porter. He said that he, and many other 
| reporters of the time, viewed a job at a 
! newspaper as a temporary stopover on 
! the way to writing the American Realis! tic Novel. The fabled scenario was to quit 
! the newspaper cold one day, and go hole 
1 up in a shack and write The Novel.
; While biding his time at the newspa; per, waiting for those glory days, Wolfe 
I started to integrate fictional techniques 
! into journalism.
One of the lectures high points was 
I Wolfes baroque description of the article 
' that inspired him to start his style of 
1 integration, later to be known as New 
; Journalism. The article, a routine po; lice item, was written with such rich,
J stentorian language that it became an 
! artwork. Wolfes dramatic reading of it 
! elicited spontaneous cheers and api plause.
 The lecture then moved to Wolfes books
as he explained the situations that ger
minated such works as Electric Kool-Aid 
Acid Test; The Right Stuff; Radical Chic 
and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers. His 
descriptions were dramatic vignettes 
packed with detail. Wolfe illustrated 
Chuck Yeager syndrome as he recalled 
how one pilots strong New York accent 
changed into a Southern drawl when he 
flew. Other incidents Wolfe related in
cluded the bizarre Black Panther party 
in Leonard Bernsteins posh apartment 
and Ken Kese/s Merry Pranksters rid
ing motorcycles in the nude.
One sentiment punctuated each of 
these stories: why werent novelists 
writing from this motherlode of mate
rial? Wolfe sadly noted that there were 
no realistic novels documenting the space 
program or the sixties, and novels about 
the Vietnam War have only recently been 
produced.
Wolfe traced the death of the realistic 
novel to an intellectual movement in the 
Sixties that restricted the novel to nar
row, concealed veins. Marxists de
claimed the novel as a bourgeois de
vice. Phillip Roth claimed the novel was 
beaten by news. Lionel Trilling issued 
an official statement of the novels death. 
According to Wolfe, this movement pro
duced an abstract, minimalist fiction that 
is still pervasive today.
Another factor in the realistic novels 
decline was journalisms usurpation of 
its place as a cultural documentary. As 
Wolfe asked, what novelist would have
the temerity to plot a novel 
as outrageous as the Jim and 
Tammy Bakker fiasco? Wolfe 
also related the story of 
Malcom Muggeridge, editor 
of Punch magazine. Mug
geridge published a parody 
of Kruschevs first visit to 
America, putting
Disneyland first on the So
viet leaders itinerary. Mug
geridge learned to his exas
peration that his parody was 
not a parody  Disneyland 
was second on Kruschevs 
schedule.
Bonfire of the Vanities is 
Wolfes attempt to counter 
these factors and restore the 
realistic novel to promi
nence. Given the novels 
outstanding sales (51 weeks 
on the best seller charts) and 
warm critical response, he 
may have succeeded. Wolfe says that 
there are many other great realistic 
novels to be written by observing mod
ern society.
One theme that Wolfe dared the writ
ers in the audience to beat him to was the 
new Babbitt, referring to Sinclair Lewis 
novel of the same name. The new Bab
bitt, according to Wolfe, is 28-33 and 
drives a BMW or Mercedes. The new 
Babbitt will not be buttery and rich look
ing like Lewis character, but gaunt, hav
ing given his body over the the great god

Author and journalist Tom Wolfe speaks last Tuesday 
in the Skibo Ballroom. Wolfes most recent book, 
Bonfire of the Vanities, was quite successful.
Aerobics. This tragic figure will not 
worship God at a church, but Art and 
Culture at a museum.
The lecture concluded with Wolfes 
description of vice in the 80s. The great 
vice of the seventies was pornography, 
the graphic depiction of the acts of pros
titutes. The great vice of the eighties is 
plutography, the graphic depiction of the 
acts of the rich. Hustler and Penthouse 
have been replaced by House and Gar
den and Connoisseur.
Wolfe then took questions from the
audience on topics from writing tech
nique (Read Sinclair Lewis How to 
Write ), to the reasons behind weird
ness in the eighties (An extended, eco
nomic boom, giving everyone freedom to 
do their own thing.)
One probing audience member asked 
if he wore his trademark white suits 
while writing. Apparently he does, but if 
he really needs to get something done, he 
will wear jeans and a turtleneck, be
cause, Wolfe says, I know I couldnt go 
out wearing that.
In person, Wolfe is a warm but re
served personality. He obliged auto
graphs cheerfully and conversed freely. 
However, Wolfe has an interesting habit 
of dropping into material from his es
says. He also is a voracious listener, 
picking up and commenting on interest
ing ideas.
Wolfe believes that his New Journal
ism, the technique of making the writer 
part of the subject and using literary 
devices in journalism, has had little ef
fect on newspaper journalism. Its main 
effect, he says, was on non-fiction books 
like All the Presidents Men and maga
zine writing.
Wolfe attacks journalism today for its 
lack of coverage. There is less coverage 
of events today than at any other time, 
he says. As more towns become onenewspaper towns, editors and owners 
care less and less about news. He also 
says that newspapers have neglected to

just been informed that this will 
be the last issue of The Tartan 
before the new semester, so I will 
run my special Christmas column 
in spite of the fact that I am proba
bly jumping the gun on almost 
everyone.
If you want to keep in that old 
fashioned Yuletide spirit, all you 
have to do is to cut out my column 
(but not before reading the fullpage ad for The Pizza Store 
behind it; we do want to maintain 
a sense of fairness toward our 
advertisers) and keep it until 
Christmas morning, when you will 
undoubtedly ignore the heaping 
piles of presents under the tree in 
order to read what I have to say 
only to be thoroughly disap
pointed. So now, without further 
ado:
Christmas. A time when people 
of all religions and creeds cele
brate in whatever manner they 
choose and engage in violent con
frontations regarding who is cele
brating it the right way. At any 
rate, as the cities and countries of 
the world bum outside my win
dow, and people of virtue violently 
slaughter each other in the 
streets, I sit in my favorite chair, 
snugly wrapped in a comforter. A 
log crackles in front of me, why it 
is crackling I dont exactly know, 
but it crackles nonetheless. I reach 
for my fifth glass of egg nog (actu
ally, I stumble and fall for my 
fifth glass of egg nog) and do what 
all God-fearing Americans do 
during this fair and peace laden 
time. I watch Christmas specials 
on the television.
The final straw came when I received 
a personalized Christmas greeting from 
the Dean addressed to Xavier BrilloMaxagraphillus. Yes, the bloom was 
gone from the collegiate rose. "
Actually, I would like someone 
to tell me what it is that makes 
those room-temperature-IQ tele
vision programmers think that 
they can take the plot of A Christ
mas Carol or Its A Wonderful 
Life and pass it off as A Very 
Special Christmas Presentation. 
Not being someone who is will
ing to.fall behind the times, I have 
decided to present my own Christ
mas special, full of all of the joy 
and happiness that characterize 
this festive season. So break out 
the egg nog, put a crackling log 
somewhere close and enjoy...

Finals and midterms and pa
pers, oh my. It felt as if the life of 
the Carnegie Mellon student was 
finally getting to me. It was as if 
all of the work but none of the 
gratification were landing on my 
lap. The last week of finals was 
upon me and I was hard pressed 
to feel that old yuletide cheer. I 
suppose that the final straw came 
when I received a personalized 
Christmas greeting from the Dean 
addressed to Xavier Brillo-Maxagraphillus. Yes, the bloom was 
gone from the collegiate rose. I 
guess thats why I stood on the 
roof of Warner Hall, ready to take 
the big jump onto the manure

suddenly I was confronted by My

, m What was your first impression 
I, ^9f Carnegie Mellon? No, Im not 
talking about that first day of 
waiting in line for the key to your 
r 7-dorm room, nor the experience of
eating a banana split from the

| ; Im talking about that moment 
; I two, three, four or more years 
t! ago, when between building home! ! coming floats and sweating over
 ! prom dates you decided to check 
i  out Carnegie Mellon University 
; ; as your prospective college, 
j ; I spent my senior year of high 
|i | school trotting back and forth to
CMU for the Saturday Pre-Col
lege Art classes, and my very first 
opinion of Carnegie Mellon cen
tered around the College of Fine 
Arts third floor and its graffiti: A 
bird in the hand is not a penny 
earned. Whoa, I thought. Cool.
I took the customary tour of the 
campus just before Carnival with 
some people from my high school. 
I remember three things from the 
tour: the on-line catalog in the 
library, the ferris wheel in the 
parking lot of Skibo, and the way 
the tour guide kept introducing 
everything on the campus as this 
is the neatest thing in the world.
I wonder, if I was a high school 
senior taking todays three-thirty 
tour, would I really believe that 
those cranes ripping the hell out 
of the campus behind the Student 
Union were the neatest thing in 
the world? I dunno.
As a tour guide, Ive always 
wondered how prospective stu
dents see Carnegie Mellon. I 
mean, what does it look like to

of the Vice President for Enrollment.
at it day in and day out? How 
does it appear to an outsider who 
wants in, and most importantly, 
how does it change as it gets 
more familiar?
To get a better look at the image 
of Carnegie Mellon from the view
point of an interested high school 
senior, I visited the Admissions 
Office and talked to four stu
dents while they waited for their 
interviews in the Admissions 
Office. I took down their ad
dresses and phone numbers so I 
can follow them through the 
admissions process, and find out 
how Carnegie Mellon changes in 
their eyes over time.
Ashish
My first target was Ashish, who 
seemed like a laid-back guy in 
his pink shirt, navy jacket, and 
white tie. Howd you hear about 
CMU? I asked.
He tilted back in his chair. I 
have a cousin that goes here, or 
used to go here, but now he goes 
to the University of Pittsburgh, 
and he told me about the com
puter science program. And, since 
Im interested in computer sci
ence, I decided to go here. I mean, 
I hope to go here.
What have you heard about 
CMUs reputation? I asked. Is 
it highly publicized where youre 
from?
He considered this for a mo
ment. No, its not really publi
cized, he said, Its one of those 
private schools that everybody 
in the back of their mind kind of 
knows about ... anyone whos 
really interested in computer sci
ence. So thats how I found out. 
Looked into a couple of good 
computer science schools, saw 
CMU at the top of the list.
A senior at a New Jersey high 
school, Ashish stayed for the 
weekend with a friend on campus 
to check out the action. I asked 
him what sort of college, what 
kind of social life he was inter
ested in.
Im looking for a decently big 
college, not too big, not too small*. 
And Im looking for a good social 
life, not kids who just go there 
and study, study, study, have no 
fun. I want to have fun, yknow, 
work four days a week and have 
fun the next three. I want to work 
and do well, but also have fun. 
So you havent really heard 
anything about Carnegie Mellon 
yet, then?
Not too many stories. Yknow, 
he said earnestly, from what Ive 
seen of it right now  I like it. It 
was three-twenty on Friday af
ternoon. Its all right, its pretty 
good. I mean, Ill find out tonight 
what its really like.
Is your friend in a fraternity? 
No, but Im sure theres some 
big party going on somewhere ... 
in some dorm somewhere. Well 
see whats going on, and then who 
knows, this might be my number 
one choice, then.
What are your other choices? 
Indiana, UMass, SUNY Buf
falo, Wisconsin, and UCLA. 
And what was it you wanted to 
study?
Computer Science and Busi
ness, yknow. Theyre related 
somehow.

Students recruit students
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Features Editor
Watch out, CMU. The Admis
sions Office is trying to recruit you. 
Again.
The office is asking students to 
return to their high schools and 
spread the word about Carnegie 
Mellon as a part of its second 
Christmas Campaign.
It takes less than one day of 
Christmas vacation; its a chance 
to talk to friends and teachers at 
your high school; and you get to 
look important, too, says junior 
Kathy Massucci, the Christmas 
Campaigns Student Coordinator.
The Admissions Office will con
tact the high school guidance de
partment of every student who 
volunteers to help with the cam
paign. All Massucci and Admis
sions Kim Jessen are asking is 
that students call their guidance 
office to set up an appointment 
during winter vacation, go to the 
appointment and discuss life at 
Carnegie Mellon with any inter
ested high school students, and 
report back to the Admissions
Office in January.
If you make kids think this is a 
great place, then you get positive 
people, claims Massucci. She 
hopes that students will see the 
Christmas Campaign as a way to 
influence who the next genera
tion of CMU students are.
Massucci and Jessen are hold
ing a mandatory organizational 
meeting in the Wherrett Room on 
Monday, December 5, at 7:30 pm. 
Well discuss procedures, provide 
materials, explain the follow-up
 which is basically just telling 
Admissions that you went  and 
answer questions, says Massucci. 
The meeting will last about an 
hour; students are asked to bring 
their high school addresses along.
The Admissions Office mailed 
2,200 letters to all freshmen and 
sophomores earlier this month. 
The letters said that the deadline 
for signing up to help was today, 
but Massucci told The Tartan that 
the deadline has been moved back 
to December 5. She asks students 
to call Kim Jessen in the Admis
sions Office (x2082) if theyre in
terested.

Phi Eta Sigma forms
continued from page L2
freshmen and seeing much in
terest in beginning a Phi Eta 
Sigma chapter at CMU, plans 
were made, dues paid, and the 
newly-conceived chapter ap
plied for a national charter over 
the summer.
On November 13, fifty-one 
' students from this years sophomore class were inducted into 
' Phi Eta Sigmas National Honor 
Society, during a rather impres
sive ceremony at which the 
organizations National Secre
tary spoke, as well as Provost 
Jordan. Phi Eta Sigma is very 
 similar to Lambda Sigma in 
 many ways, yet there are sev
eral differences.
' Lambda Sigma focuses 
mainly on sophomores, and 
although students are inducted 
; ks freshmen, their active par
ticipation in the chapter begins 
and ends during their sopho
more year. Phi Eta Sigma oper
ates with the idea that once a 
student is inducted, he or she 
remains an active member 
throughout his or her four years 
at college. It is not a one-year 
commitment. Also, Phi Eta
Phi Eta Sigma de
sires to make its 
focus orienting fresh
men into the aca
demic world of CMU. 
Sigma desires to make its pri
mary focus orienting freshmen 
into the academic world of CMU 
by offering services such as tu
toring and group meetings es
pecially designed to help fresh
men cope with time manage
ment and academic stress, 
whereas Lambda Sigma focus 
more on off-campus service 
projects and general campus ac
tivities such as Carnival.
The chapter is new, yet its 
purpose is perhaps something 
that is long overdue. Freshmen 
have always been a sector of 
CMUs population which lacked 
a specific organization which 
could integrate them both 
emotionally and academically 
into college life. Phi Eta Sigma 
hopes to be able to accomplish 
this while at the same time 
providing valuable services to 
its older members.
Ombudsman conducts supernatural campus tour
continued from page L3
I explained to him that in the face 
of all of the pressures of student 
life I was beginning to wish that I 
had never been born. He smiled 
and told me my wish was granted. 
Soon we were walking down the 
cut, watching a day in the life of 
this new, Javi-Free CMU.
Our first stop was a frat party. 
My Student Ombudsman ex
plained that every time the sound 
of an Iron City beer being opened 
was heard it meant that a Stu
dent Ombudsman was being pro
moted to Dean of Student Affairs. 
He told me that he hoped that we 
would be hearing this sound soon. 
As I ogled over some nearby co
eds, My Student Ombudsman 
pointed out that since I had never 
been born, I had helped improve 
the dating scene at Carnegie 
Mellon, having lowered the boy/ 
girlratioby .00000000000000001.
We floated across campus to 
Hunt Library, where dozens of 
unread copies of Gourmet lay 
forlornly in a corner. I soon found 
out that since I had never been 
born, no one ever read Gourmet 
magazine at the library anymore. 
My Student Ombudsman ex
plained that the subscription was
about to be cancelled in favor of 
Celibate Living, a magazine 
which they felt best reflected the 
needs of the CMU student body.
As we wafted out of Hunt Li
brary, I noticed that the Fence 
looked sickly and emaciated. My 
Student Ombudsman soon ex
plained to me that since I hadnt 
painted the Fence that one time 
last year, the Fence simply wasnt 
as thick as I remembered it. I 
countered that I had only painted 
the Fence once; he explained that 
every layer counts.
We flew into the air, and I saw 
on-campus life unfold without me. 
Students getting extra helpings 
of Kilite food that should have 
gone to me, Macintosh viruses 
forced to die out for lack of the 
precious nourishment of my 
computer disks, the Tartan Fea
tures Editor staring in misery at 
two empty columns on his page, 
trying to fit another Pizza Store 
ad in the space, and finally a 
gaggle of typists at the registrars 
office, reveling in the joy of never 
again having to spell the name 
Javier Grillo-Marxuach.
And soon we were floating over 
the entire world, and I noticed 
horrible things occurring on a
global scale. Jolt Cola bottling 
plants being shut down perma
nently and Vivarin stocks plum
meting, Bennetton factories thriv
ing and my parents living a nor
mal life free of the extreme finan
cial deprivation characteristic of 
the Carnegie Mellon parent.
I felt My Student Ombudsman 
nudging me back toward campus.
The final and most heartwrenching experience came as we 
returned to Warner Hall. We 
walked through a lonely hallway, 
at the end of which a solitary light 
beamed from the crack of a semi
open office door. We entered and 
there I saw him, President Cyert, 
hunched over his desk, a silent 
tear welling up in his eye. 
Whats the matter? I asked. 
Hes crying because he doesnt 
have the $17,000 he needs to fill 
out Steve Jobs check for the NeXT 
machine.
NO! I cried, fearing the pros
pect of life without a souped-up 
Mac Plus with a fancy stereo, Ill 
give him the money! I cant see a 
grown man cry! Please, bring me 
back! Bring me back! I want to 
pay through the nose for a twoby-two magnesium cube!
Its too late, Javi, you were
never born.
I threw myself at his feet, crying, 
wondering how I could be so self
ish in inflicting such wounds on 
my Alma Mater.
My Student Ombudsman fi
nally relented. What happened 
next was one big blur, but I soon 
came to, wondering how I could 
have survived the fall from the 
roof of Warner Hall. Soon it 
dawned upon me that I had landed 
on top of the Free South Africa 
shanty. I got up, brushed the f 
sawdust from my clothes and ran 
across campus, wishing everyone 
a Happy Holiday, confident in my 
new lease on life and even more 
confident in the fact that I would 
fail my DP final since my ethereal * 
journey caused me to relinquish 
all of my precious study time. I 
heard an Iron City beer being 
opened in the distance. I smiled. 
Its a wonderful school after all.

Interviewing future college students
continued from page L3
fact, there are four other schools 
that shes pretty interested in, 
and she was just a bit shocked by 
all the manure on the Cut. She 
twisted her hands together in her 
lap. I found myself apologizing to 
her for the mess and smell.
Amy first heard about Carne
gie Mellon from the college propa
ganda the mailman bombards her 
with daily. It stuck out. It 
ounded perfect. Good Fine Arts 
program. Not too big. Friendly, 
fun, diversified....
Amy intends to study art, so I 
asked her what sort of art pro
gram she was looking for. I want 
to study in an art department 
thats large compared with every
thing else in the college. I want 
diversity, and Carnegie Mellons 
other departments are just as good 
as its Art Department, so I like 
that. I want to study other things 
besides just art.
Also, I noticed there were a lot 
more guys than girls on the cam
pus.
Lucy
The Universitys reputation as 
diversified appealed to Lucy, 
another high school senior. Lucy 
has a definite path she intends to 
follow for her education. I asked 
her what she planned to study: 
Tm not quite sure. I want to do 
something perfectly suited to me. 
I dont want to pick something 
thats wrong for me... thats why, 
here its diversified, and I like 
that. Lucy had heard about CMU 
from a friend whod attended the 
Pre-College Drama program a few 
summers ago.
Whats your impression of the 
campus now that youre here? I 
asked, wondering how she felt 
about the manure. Have you 
taken the tour?
No, were taking the next tour, 
but we walked around earlier and 
basically saw everything. Its so 
impressive! The people are so
friendly!
Have you met many people, 
then?
Well, you, and we asked some
body how to get to the bookstore. 
What area of study are you 
looking into, science?
She twirled a long blond ringlet 
around her finger. The humani
ties, I think. The woman who 
interviewed me told me I have 
two years to make up my mind 
here, and I like that.
What other colleges are you 
interested in?
I looked at Gettysburg but I 
didnt like it. Here it seems every
bodys friendly and more active. 
It looks like a big social place. 
There are more people here and 
its spaced out more and its in 
reach of the city... Gettysburg was 
more, she lowered her voice conspiratorially, I call it generic, but 
... this is a step up. Its neat.
Robert
Robert looked like he would 
rather have crawled behind his 
chair than answer any questions. 
I could barely hear his responses.
Howd you hear about CMU? I 
asked, pushing my tape recorder 
closer.
Through a computer search at 
school. You tell them what you 
want in a college and they show 
you all the colleges that fit the 
description. After I got my SAT 
scores, Carnegie Mellon sent me 
a bunch of stuff. Robert wants to 
study Biomedical Engineering 
and Chemical Engineering. 
What are your career goals? 
Something medical. Roberts 
eyes searched the office for es
cape. He cringed as Jan, the re
ceptionist, offered his father some 
coffee. I pushed the tape recorder 
closer and he looked down at it 
nervously. He slunk down in his 
chair and fingered the edges of 
his jacket and tie.
So, whats your impression of 
the University?
Sounds pretty competitive. 
Really? Have you taken the 
tour?
Yeah.
What do you think of campus? 
Its pretty nice.
What are you looking for in a 
college as far as a social life is 
concerned? Have you heard any
thing about CMUs social life 
compared to other schools?
Not really. Theyre all pretty 
much the same.
We were interrupted by the 
Admissions Counselor conducting 
Roberts interview. As she spoke 
to Roberts father, I asked Robert 
if this was his first interview.
Nah, this is my third or fourth 
 its still a little weird, cause 
this is probably my first choice 
school.
I asked Robert if I could talk to 
him for a few minutes after he 
finished his interview, but he and 
his father snuck away while I was 
at the water fountain.
I asked the students for their 
address and phone number and 
told them Id get in touch with 
them after Christmas to see how 
they were doing on applications.
Im working on the essay right 
now, Amy said. Indeed, I think it 
was in her lap among the stack of 
papers she was carrying.
Oh, I just got the application, 
Lucy sounded worried. Its not 
due yet, I dont think.
Im done with mine. Ashish 
rubbed his stomach. I just need 
to find out my SAT scores. See if I 
have a chance to get in here.
Ill have to call them all after 
Christmas break, maybe chit-chat 
a bit, find out what theyre up to, 
ask them how CMITs been treat
ing them. I can hardly wait.

series which will run intermit

Wolfe doesnt read any maga
zine regularly, but he cites The 
American Observer, Harpers 
Magazine, and Rolling Stone as 
favorites. He also expresses an 
enthusiasm for some comic books, 
noting with amusement the time 
he was featured as a character in 
an issue of Marvel Comics Doctor 
Strange magazine.
Critics have attacked Wolfe 
often. Bonfire of the Vanities de
piction of inner-city blacks led 
many to label Wolfe a racist. He 
insists that the depiction is accu
rate: I would challenge any of 
those people to observe that situ
ation for a few months, then we 
can compare notes.
Wolfes anti-elitist theories of 
art have also come under heavy 
criticism as retrograde and 
ignorant. Wolfe says that his 
essays on the art world, The 
Painted Word, The Worship of 
Art, and From Bauhaus to Our
House were accurate observa
tions, and tfye only real histories 
of modem art.
Both criticisms, Wolfe says, 
occurred because he refused to go 
with the common fashionable 
ideas formed by trendy intellec
tuals. One writer, Christopher 
Hitchens, who Wolfe calls an 
idiot, has accused Wolfe of being 
a reactionary. Wolfe says that he 
only writes what he sees hon
estly, and that these attacks are 
made because sometimes he 
doesnt follow the trends of the 
time.

Keep warm with Grandma-style soup
Indian Summer hascomeand 
gone, which means its getting 
colder. We have to find ways of 
keeping warmer, and if you 
asked Grandma how to do this 
shed tell you  after advising 
you to put on the obligatory 
fifty-five sweaters  to have 
some soup. Preferably her 
homemade chicken soup, but if 
Grandmas inNorth Dakota and 
youre here in Pittsburgh, and 
the mails being what they are, 
shell be satisfied if you just 
have soup.
Grandmas are firm believers 
in the powers of homemade 
chicken soup. Therefore, to 
make your Grandma happy, 
The Tartan provides you with a 
recipe for chicken soup to sus
tain you until you can get home 
for winter break and have some 
of hers. Im leaving out definite 
measurements because, unlike 
baking, soup is not an exact 
science. Theres plenty of room 
to experiment and adapt to suit 
your own tastes. If you want 
more than I suggest of some
thing (such as onions), modify 
the recipe to your hearts con
tent. If you dont have early
morning classes one day, you can 
start in the morning and have 
soup ready to eat when you come 
home. Or you can put it up in the 
evening, let it sit overnight (in the 
refrigerator, for safetys sake) 
after cooking it, and have it the 
next day.
Chicken soup always starts with 
broth. If you want to do it the old 
fashioned way, you boil a dismem
bered stewing chicken for an hour 
or two. If you want to speed up the 
process, you can start with canned 
broth (Campbells and College Inn 
are fairly reliable brands). Two 
cans is a comparable amount.
If you made your own broth, 
take the . chicken out of the pot, 
skin it and bone it. Youll proba
bly want to let it cool beforehand. 
Throw away the skin and return 
the meat and bones to the pot.
If you started with canned 
broth, you need meat to add 
substance to the soup. Throw 
in some boned chicken breast 
or thigh meat  such as Holly 
Farms Time-Trimmers  and 
simmer until the meat is done.
Toss in a couple of onions, 
carrots, and (Grandmas secret 
ingredient) a bunch of fresh dill 
weed. Let the whole thing sim
mer for ah hour or two more 
and invite a friend over for 
homemade soup.
French Onion Soup
2 or 3 cans beef broth, 3 table
spoons butter, 4-6 large yellow 
sliced onions, lots of freshly 
grated cheese (Swiss, Mozza
rella, Parmesan, Gruyere), 
thickly sliced French bread.
Melt the butter in the bottom 
of a large pot. When it bubbles, 
add the onions and sautee until 
they are wilted and transpar
ent. Add the beef broth and let 
simmer for two or three hours.
When serving, top each 
bowlful with a buttered slice of 
French bread and liberal 
amounts of grated cheese.

SportspeakTartan runners finish 16th at NCAA meet
Frats help end
year on a 
positive note
ffwas walking through the 
last week (something I 
often do whenever I feel depfkssed), when I happened upon 
a femputer fair, or some other 
t$pe event, going on in the 
atrium. I saw a huge Apple 
computer display right next to 
an even bigger IBM display.
'Each company had about five 
computers showing pretty color 
graphics, playing music; all 
t|hings that the average college 
^tudent is willing to pay $5,000 
tjo have a computer do. 
j. The representatives from 
^pple and IBM, these collegeeducated, Botany 500-clad indi\jiduals, were hanging balloons 
4nd putting out flying disks 
(iFrisbees to all you people who 
dont know that that is a brand 
name) with the company logo.
I looked around a potted fern 
and saw about 20 people 
huddled around something. I 
ohecked back at the Apple and 
BM spreads and noticed that 
no one, other than the reps 
were at them. I went over to 
the crowd to see what was up.
J There, at a small table, sat 
one guy. He was wearing a dull 
Sweater, a pair of blue jeans and 
p scarf. The people around him 
were frozen as they watched 
t)his guy leisurely operate the 
greatest thing to hit the world 
c)f technology since the solar cal
culator  a NeXT computer.
! I was amazed, not at the madhine, but at the fact that, for 
all their free gifts and other 
fHlls, the biggies had not ner 
 soul at their displays. One 
guy, with one computer, had 
totally awed over 20 individu
als. It was like watching a 
bunch of people as they looked 
through those huge windows as 
their cars get washed.
I didnt see what the big deal 
was. Hit it with a sledgeham
mer, and it still breaks  just 
like any other computer. I guess 
that different people have 
different ideas about what is 
important.
The most important event on 
and for this campus happened 
last week, in my mind. I must 
tip my hat (see above picture) to 
the Greeks on this campus, es
pecially Theta Xi. Basket Bucks 
88 illustrated just how useful 
and important a positive Greek 
community on a college campus 
can be.
j Ask most people what they 
think of when they think of a 
college fraternity, and youll be 
sure to hear things like beer, 
parties, and they get all the 
women. However, last Satur
day all the fraternities, includ
ing some (GD) Independent or
ganizations got together for a 
really great cause.
; I was asked to be a referee at 
two of the games. Even though 
the play was rough and I was 
questioned on some calls (big 
deal), all the players kept in 
mind the purpose of the event 
-jto raise money to fight Multjple Sclerosis.
I never felt like an outsider, 
although I am not in a frat. Ev
eryone, especially TX, was very 
hjappy to have me help out, as 
they were with everyone.
' I was so pleased to see the en
tire Greek community come to
gether to have fun and help out 
a worthy cause. Im happy that 
I!can end this last column on 
such a positive note. I had a 
great time and I thank you for 
your support.

Carnegie Mellon Mens Cross 
Country team competed in the 
NCAA Nationals on Saturday, at 
Washington University in St. 
Louis. The team won their region 
last week, which qualified them 
run at the National meet. Al
though they did not meet the high 
expectations they had going in, 
this race ended what was one of 
their best seasons ever.
Running against the best teams 
in the country, such as Wiscon
sin, Rochester, and Brandeis, 
Carnegie Mellon finished six
teenth overall. The team from 
Wisconsin-Osh Kosh won the 
meet.
Junior Co-captain Dave Supp 
finished his excellent season with 
another outstanding perform
ance. Supp was the first Carnegie 
Mellon runner to cross the finish 
line, coming in at 25:24. How
ever, this fine showing was not 
enough to capture an All-American title. Supp finished 26th over
all, missing the elusive title by 
only one place. The top 25 finish
ers in this race qualify as AllAmericans.
Also running for Carnegie Mel
lon was Senior Co-captain Pat 
Noll. Noll was the fifth Tartan 
runner to cross the line, 142nd 
overall. Noll ends his successful 
college running career with this 
meet. Although Noll did not run 
his ideal race, he has proven 
himself a talented runner and 
has remained consistent for the 
team over the past four years.
Also representing CMU were 
four other juniors: Gary Meeker, 
Gary Harrison, Len ONeal, and 
Tim Berger.
This was the first National meet 
for freshman Mike Damon. Da
mon, who has run strong races 
most of this season, placed fourth 
for the team with a time of 26:30.
Nationals is the largest race 
the men have run all season. 
There were 184 men running on 
Saturday, which forced the pack 
to run very tight.
According to ONeal, this was 
one of the worst races he ran this 
season. He commented that al
most all of the other runners were 
very upset with their perform
ances, as was Coach Gary Meckley.
Nationals is typically a fast race,
photo by Robin Hensinger
Carnegie Mellons Dave Supp (55) stayed with the lead pack for most of the race. Even though he placed 
continued on page LL2 first for CMU, he slipped back to miss out on an All-American title by just one place, finishing 26th overall.

CLEVELAND  The Carnegie 
Mellon womens basketball team 
opened its 1988-89 season with 
two big wins against University 
Athletic Association (UAA) rivals 
at Case Western Reserve Uni
versity last weekend. The Lady 
Tartans defeated the Lady Judges 
of Brandeis University on Satur
day, 70-51, and the Lady Spar
tans of Case Reserve on Sunday, 
68-38.
Sunday afternoon, CMU out
played Case Reserve both offen
sively and defensively. The Lady 
Spartans were able to score more 
than one basket only twice with
out Carnegie Mellon responding 
with at least two points of its 
own.
The game started with the tip 
going to Case and a quick twoshot foul on junior Tricia Chorgo. 
Cases Wendy Mramor made both 
free throws and Case led 2-0. 
Less than a minute later, senior 
co-captain Lisa Lightner scored 
her 1000th career point with a 
three point shot from the right 
wing. The Lady Tartans then had 
the lead; they never relinquished 
it.
Carnegie Mellon extended its 
lead to 20-8 midway through the 
first half on the fine efforts of 
both the starters and CMU bench. 
Freshmen Amy Buxbaum, Katie 
Fahey, Heather ODonnell, Leigh 
Ann Palovich and Tammy Paulos, 
sophomore Lisa Schmidt and
junior Lisa Smith, a transfer from 
Carlow College, scored eight points 
off the bench to help the Lady 
Tartans to a 28-17 lead at the end 
of the first half.
Case managed to hit only six out 
of 26 field goals in the first half. 
Hitting five of eight iree throws 
and outrebounding CMU, 25-15, 
kept the Lady Spartans in the 
game. Case had 20 turnovers, 
which helped the Lady Tartans, 
who were shooting 40% (12 of 30) 
from the floor and 50% from the 
charity stripe (2 of 4). At the end of 
the first half, only Smith was in 
foul trouble, racking up three 
personals, two of them offensive 
charges.
I turned around to shoot. I didnt 
touch her. I think it was kind of 
cheap, said Smith, referring to 
her second offensive foul.
The second half was a rerun of 
the first. Effective CMU offense 
and defense stopped Case from 
getting back into the game. The 
Lady Tartans were 19 of36 (52.7%) 
from the floor while the Lady 
Spartans only took 21 shots in the 
entire half, making 10 of them. 
Full court pressure and the half 
court man-to-man defense as well 
as the fast paced offense kept Case 
running behind the Lady Tartans. 
Turnovers also helped to slow 
down the Lady Spartans. They 
turned the ball over 19 times in 
the second half, and forced CMU 
to give up the ball only six times. 
Case pulled down 16 rebounds to 
Carnegie Mellons eight in the half.
Three Lady Tartans scored in
double figures. Lightner led the 
team with 17 points, followed by 
Smith and junior Valerie 
Kwaitkowski with 10 apiece. 
Chorgo led CMU on the boards, 
pulling down 5 rebounds. Cases 
sophomore Anita Gebauerhad 12 
points for the Lady Spartans, and 
Mramor had 11 rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon started the 
weekend by trouncing Brandeis. 
After the opening tap, the basket
ball court resembled a race track 
more than an arena as the Lady 
Tartans ran the ball up and down 
the court and ran the Lady Judges 
into the floor.
I thought the game would be 
closer. It was a nice surprise for 
me, said Head Coach Gerri Seidl.
CMU took 64 shots in the game, 
32 of them going through the hoop 
(50%). Brandeis attempted to 
score 49 times, successful only 15 
times (30.6%). The Lady Tartans 
and the Lady Judges were evenly 
matched in rebounds (43-42 
CMU), steals (16-14 CMU), and 
turnovers (35-39 CMU). Brandeis, 
however, made 20 out of 38 foul 
shots (52.6%) to CMUs 3 for 12 
(25%), and had 18 personal fouls 
to Carnegie Mellons 31.
Lightner scored 15 points to 
pace the Lady Tartans, along with 
senior Beth Virgin, who had 11, 
and Chorgo and Kwaitkowski 
with 10 points each. Chorgo 
crashed the boards 10 times for 
CMU. Rachel Perry of Brandeis 
had 17 points and 11 rebounds, 
while her teammate, Paula

Mens hoops opens with two losses
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
CLEVELAND  The more things change, the 
more they remain the same. A brand new Tartan 
basketball team opened its second University Ath
letic Association season on the road and headed 
home with two losses: 60-52 versus Brandeis Uni
versity in the season opener, and 76-68 against host 
Case Western Reserve University.
The losses on the road are not new; the Tartans 
are now 12-37 over the last five seasons away from 
Skibo Gym. Carnegie Mellon shot selection was 
different, after lacking a genuine long-range threat 
since David Bart graduated two years ago, the 
Tartans discovered the three-point shot. In their 
two games, the team shot 29 three-pointers, mak
ing seven of them.
Another change was the number of freshmen on 
the court. The 1987 recruiting class provided one 
freshman, this years class already has two major 
contributors. Guard Philip Bronner stepped into 
the starting lineup and immediately demonstrated 
his quick hands with eight steals, six against Case 
Western,
Another freshman guard, Chris Dobbs, also 
helped out against the Spartans with 13 points.
Tartan Head Coach Larry Anderson was pleased
with the play of his two recruits, expecting even 
better things from them later in the season. I think 
that he [Bronner] and Dobbs will be two good 
guards for us, he claimed.
Unfortunately, despite new blood and a newlyfound confidence to take the outside shot, the final 
results were still the same  two more road losses.
The season opened against the Brandeis Judges 
and their playmaker Stanley House. The Judges 
were picked to finish fourth in the UAA this season, 
but their play was more than enough to avenge last 
seasons 87-80 loss to CMU.
Brandeis jumped out to a 36-25 halftime lead due 
to poor Tartan rebounding and an unusually high 
number of fouls. At halftime, the Judges were 
outrebounding CMU 20-11, and the Tartans had 
committed 17 fouls to Brandeis eight.
Carnegie Mellon was able to close the gap in the 
second half, but they had dug themselves too deep 
a hole, losing 60-52. Darryl Long led Tartan scoring 
with 15 points while Daren Moffatt added 13 for the 
CMU cause.
The Tartan team that started the second game 
against Case Reserve looked 100% better than the 
team that had played the day before. Senior Dave 
Sikora put up a lay-up to give CMU a 2-0 lead that 
steadily grew through the first half.

Swimmers open season 
with a tough invitational
By MELIZA YUMANG
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Friday, the Carnegie Mellon swim teams entered into the' 
1988-89 season with an invitational relay meet at Westminster 
College.
Although the teams did not place first, the swimmers did well, 
considering they were coming off of some tough practices.
In the womens competition, Edinboro University placed first 
with 122 points, Westminster came in second with 98, CMU tied 
with Grove City College at 42 points for third place, and Buffalo 
State came in with 30 points, for fourth place.
The competition for the men was tough as well, being that most 
of the scholarship universities are in Division II, except Grove 
City and Buffalo State. Edinboro placed first again with 112 
points, Grove City followed with 82 points, Westminster was. 
third at 56 points, Fairmont trailed closely with 53 points, CMU 
came in fifth place with 47 points, and Buffalo State placed last 
again with 40 points.
Coach Jim Perkins explained, Were still tired from training 
hard. We didnt expect to swim real fast. We had a lot more really 
good swims than I expected. Individually, the results were 
much better.
Senior Beth Karasick and sophomore Alyson Colbertson won 
the womens diving relay. The women also placed third in the 
3x500 freestyle. Swimming that relay were Anita Fisher, Dewie 
Madsen, and Suzy Kelley.
Fisher agreed with the coach on the teams condition and per-_ 
formance. Usually before the meets we have easy practices and 
lighter workouts. But since this was only an invitational we 
didnt slow down our yardage. It was good practice for a lot of the 
freshman. But overall, everyone did pretty well.
Performances werent lacking individually either. Freshman 
Melissa Van Royen did well in the 100-yard backstroke with a 
time of 1:08.3 seconds. Van Royen commented later, I was 
pretty excited about how I did. By the end of this year, I should 
be a lot faster than I was before. Other outstanding perform
ances were Anna Lesko in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle 
and Tiffany Pickering in the 100-yard fly.
The mens team earned two other third places at the invita
tional. Swimming in the 4x50-yard freestyle relay were Pat 
Hensler, Hal Levine, Paul Moran, and Doug Vunic. The other 
relay was the 3x500 freestyle swam by Norman Murray, Doug 
Lindblad, and Brian Zimmerman. Lindblad commented, The 
swims were OK. Both Brian, who swam under five minutes, and 
Norman had very good swims.
Lindblad, a senior, believes in a good season for the team. I 
think overall weve been working very hard, doing a lot of long 
yardage. Everyone did a good job despite all the hard practices

IM Soccer, Waterpolo 
hold championships
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Wednesday, ATO met 
the Reciprocal Boys (RB) in the 
IM Majors Soccer Champion
ship. The RB took ATO by sur
prise with their reserved game, 
^ which included a tremendous 
amount of passing. RB manr aged to keep the ball down near 
1 the ATO goal. However, they
 vvere unable to score.
The second half started with 
an ATO kickoff which was 
quickly stolen and taken 
downfield. A shot on the ATO 
goal sent the ball out of bounds, 
but not before the goalie had 
touched it. On the ensuing corner kick, Chris Christodoyloy 
knocked the ball in to give the 
RB the lead, 1-0.
Seconds later, ATO was down 
near the RB goal, where Arie 
Winograd scored off the 
goalpost, tying the game.
With four minutes left in the 
game, Pete Koshinski broke 
downfield with the ball. He 
scored ATOs second and last 
goal of the game. RB tried to 
come back but ATO ran the 
clock down and won the IM 
Majors soccer championship by 
a score of 2-1.
0 In other action last Wednes
day, the Waterpolo Majors 
Champion played the Minors 
Champion for the overall title.
Majors Champion SAE de
feated Sudsuckers for the title. 
Both teams scored a point in 
the first few minutes of the 
I game. By the end of the first 
! half, SAE was leading by a score 
of3-2. In the course of the game, 
j the referees threatened to eject 
an SAE player for his contin| ual fouling.
The second half started with 
| two scores on the first three 
; shots. SAE still led by a point.
I The third quarter ended with 
I SAE still out in front by two 
points. The fourth quarter 
| started with an early goal by
SAE. With three minutes left, 
Sudsuckers scored two con
secutive points, cutting the 
SAE lead to only one point. 
SAE replied with another 
behind-the-back shot that 
scored.
On a Sudsucker drive, their 
goalie came out of the box and 
swam a little to get a better 
pass off. SAE blocked the pass 
and scored with the goalie out 
of the box. With two minutes 
left, SAE started killing time.
With one minute left, the 
SAE player who had been 
warned earlier was ejected.
SAE won by a score of 10-7. 
One of the referees was disap
pointed at the number of pen
alties in the game and warn
ings he had to give.
In Three-Man Volleyball ac
tion The Club met Offensive 
Policy in early season play.
Three members of the vol
leyball team that made it to 
the Six-Man and Co-Rec Volball Championship games 
could not win their first ThreeMan game.
The Club, with two power 
spikers, Chris Holt and Dave 
Pessoa, were unstoppable.
They took an early lead with 
a comfortable margin of ten 
points. Offensive Policy tried 
to make a comeback, but could 
only get two points, thus los
ing their first game by a score 
of 15-5.
In the second game, Offen
sive Policy took an early lead 
with a score of 3-2. The Club 
took the lead with the help of 
Dave Pessoas serving. On 
three consecutive serves, Of
fensive Policy was unable to 
return the ball. The Club went 
on to win the second game by a 
score of 15-11, and thus the 
match.
After the game, the Offen
sive Policy players predicted 
that The Club would go on to 
win the championship game 
because theyre unbeatable.

Well kids, the college football 
schedule is coming to a close and 
bowl season is upon us. Many Pitt 
fans are upset with the selection 
process because their team was 
shut out of the bowl picture. These 
complaints are justified because 
the Pitt athletic director was lied 
to by officials from two different 
bowls and the team has been 
excluded from the NCAAs foot
ball post-season party. This inci
dent, however, only scratches the 
surface of the farce that is the 
college football bowls.
Problem: While the bowls gen
erate large revenues for the 
NCAA, the competing teams and 
the bowl officials, they fail to 
produce an undisputed national 
champion. Some teams are de
prived of a chance to be recognized'as number one because they 
play in weak conferences or their 
conference is tied to a particular 
bowl so they cannot play a highly 
ranked team. We have been lucky 
in recent years because the num
ber one and two teams have met 
in a New Years day bowl to de
cide the national championship, 
but this year, as in most years, 
that probably will not happen.
An additional problem is that 
the bowl bids go out before the 
conclusion of the regular season, 
so the national championship 
picture can change after the teams 
have made their commitments.
For example, this Saturday No. 
1 ranked Notre Dame plays No. 2 
USC. If USC wins, then No. 4 
West Virginia, who plays Notre 
Dame in the Fiesta Bowl, could be 
denied a chance to play No. 3 
Miami.
The reason USC cant play 
Miami or West Virginia in a bowl 
is that USC is the Pac 10 cham
pion so they are forced to play the 
Big 10 champion (No. 11 Michi
gan) in the Rose Bowl.
Another team that feels cheated 
is undefeated Arkansas (No. 10). 
Because they are the Southwest 
Conference champions they must 
play UCLA in the Cotton Bowl.
Solution: Keep the bowls, but 
use them as a playoff tournament, 
like college basketball. Use the 
minor, lower paying bowls for the 
first round, then use the major 
bowls for the quarterfinals and 
semifinals. The National Cham
pionship game could then be 
played in The Grandaddy of them 
all, the Rose Bowl.
This sixteen-team tournament 
could include the champions from 
the Big 10, Pac 10, Big 8, Atlantic
NationalChampion/
Coast, Southeastern, and South
western Conferences, at least one 
independent and nine at-large 
bids.
This year those would be: Michi
gan, USC, Nebraska, Clemson, 
LSU, Arkansas, Notre Dame, 
Miami, West Virginia, Auburn, 
Oklahoma, UCLA, Florida St., 
Wyoming, Syracuse and Okla
homa St. These teams represent
the top sixteen ranked teams in 
college football.
These playoffs would create 
much fan interest and revenue 
for the NCAA. If the Freedom 
Bowl can sell out with Brigham 
Young vs. Colorado, I am sure it 
could sell out, and get better tele
vision ratings with a first round 
playoff game between Auburn and 
Arkansas.
This playoff system would cre
ate more money for the NCAA 
than the present bowl system, in 
addition to gaining more fan in
terest and determining a true Na
tional Champion in Division IA 
college football.
Besides, then we could all ar
gue over who should be invited to, 
the tournament, instead of who 
should be number one.

Eldred, a junior, said, This was

a practice to get back on the div
ing board. Compared to last year, 
everyones improved two-fold

> wjth the top runners starting out
- h$rd in order to stay up in front.
 I;have never gone out that fast 
; before in my life, said Damon.
; One important element that 
- hurt the Tartans was the course 
; at Washington University. The 
; team had been training on the 
\ hilly terrain around Schenley 
j park all season. The Nationals 
1 course was totally flat, taking the 
J runners over a soccer field at one 
; point. For Supp and Noll, this 
; was a major setback, since they 
; usually make up lost time on the 
; hills. Supp stated later that he 
I was looking for a hill near the end 
; of the race in order to try and 
; catch up.
; Also, the runners were forced to 
| wear spiked shoes in order to
 handle the mud and slush left 
\ from a rainy night before. The
 coaches had a major concern before the race since Supp had a 
{ history of problems with his Achil: les tendon while running in 
: spikes.
; For now, the team and the 
; coaches will have to spend some 
j time trying to understand what 
; went wrong. In interviews with 
: various members of the team, no 
one could pinpoint an exact cause 
of the problems in the National 
i meet.
Most of the men will go on to 
. compete on CMUs Track and
i Field team in January, where they 
hope they have as good a year as 
' they did in Cross-Country. All 
seven of the runners at Nation; als, with the exception of Noll,
 will be coming back next year to 
; run Cross-Country where they 
; will train for a more successful
 meet at Nationals.

Case comes back to beat 
the Tartans, 76-68
continued from page LIO
The hot hands of Dobbs, Moffatt, and Long combined for 32 
first-half points as the Tartans 
grabbed a 41-30 lead. The team 
regained control of the back
boards, grabbing 25 rebounds to 
the Spartans 12.
Things changed in the second 
half. Long picked up his fourth 
foul one-and-one-half minutes 
into the second half and Moffatt 
joined him on the bench with four 
fouls several minutes later.
While the Tartan frontcourt was 
playing short-handed, the Spar
tans quickly mounted a comeback. 
Over a five minute period, Case 
reeled off 13 straight points, 
changing a 49-40 Tartan lead to a 
53-49 Spartan lead.
Explaining Cases comeback, 
Anderson said, What was criti
cal was not his [Longs] fourth or 
fifth foul, it was his third with 
seven seconds to go in the first 
half.
By the time CMU realized what 
had happened, it was too late. 
Bronner hit a three-pointer and 
two lay-ups to put the Tartans 
back up by three, but Case had 
the breaks and won 76-68.
The Tartans return home this 
week to face even stiffer competi
tion. This weekends Camdfeie 
Mellon Tournament features Al
legheny, Juniata, and Westmin
ster. Allegheny was a preseason 
Top 10 pick this season, and West
minster is expected to win NAIA 
Division 18.

We find that at present the human race is divided politically into one wise man, nine
knaves, and ninety fools out of every hundred. That is, by an'optimistic observer.
\
The nine knaves assemble themselves under the banner of the most knavish among 
them, and become politicians: the wise man stands out, because he knows himself 
to be hopelessly outnumbered, and devotes himself to poetry, mathematics or 
philosophy; while the ninety fools plod off behind the banners of the nine villains, 
according to fancy, into the labyrinths of chicanery, malice and warfare...If it is de
mocracy, then the nine knaves will become members of parliament; if fascism, they 
will become party leaders; if communism, commissars. Nothing will be different, 
except the name. The fools will be still fools, the knave still leaders, the results still 
exploitation. As for the wise man, his lot will be much the same under any ideology.

Wisdom cant always be snuffed at the hands of knaves. The artist 
lives a conviction, a solemn search for truth. Life by any other standards 
would be contrived, a lie. Unfortunately, much of the world isnt sensi.... 
tive to this devotion. Often, the artist is ostracized, forced to live on the 
fringe. Many would argue that by nature the artist is aloof, that alienation 
is self-generated. Beset by fools and knaves unwilling to listen, to learn: 
what other recourse do the wise have?
The light is those who write, who read, who live their convictions. 
This issue toasts their wisdom.

and scrape the water away. At night, another 
switch throws light out into the blackness.
"He was an interesting man," says 
Michael. "He's lived there all his life, on the 
side of the highway."
"People live everywhere," she says. 
"We're going to be late."
Michael pushes hard on the accelera
tor and the car shudders slightly with the 
combined weight of gravity and speed as the 
highway rocks up the crevasses of the darken
ing mountain.
The cabin is warm and wonderful, and 
the people all seem to be caught in a feeling of 
intimacy that seems to occur when only a thin 
wooden wall protects them from nature. The 
soft flicker of firelight speaks of darkness to 
Michael, and the wooden ceiling seems a bar
rier to him, unwanted protection. He wants 
nothing between himself and the stars.
He grabs Andrea by the elbow. "Come 
down to the lake with me. Let's go for a walk."
Andrea turns to him. "I'm not going 
out there."
Michael scans the room, L.L. Bean and 
small talk. The promise of the land is outside 
the window. He sees himself strolling along 
the even shore, he has to go. But he had 
thought that at least she would go with him.
"Just a little walk."
"No," says Andrea. "It's cold out. It's 
too dark out there. I don't think it's safe, Mi
chael."
Michael scoffs as he wraps his jacket 
around himself. "This is Disneyland," he says. 
"There's nothing to be afraid of out there. It's 
all civilized."
"Hey!" cries Jerry as he approaches, 
drink in hand. "Leaving so soon?"
"No," says Andrea.
"Thought I'd check out the lake. Looks 
beautiful," says Michael.
Jerry stands straight, puts his free 
hand in his pocket. "It's pretty cold out there, 
Mike. Dark, too. I don't think that's such a 
good idea."
"Just a few minutes," says Michael, 
feeling like a child trying to deal with doting 
parents.
"You going too, Andrea?" asks Jerry.
"I'm not going out there."
"I am," says Michael, tired of waiting 
for permission.
"Real outdoorsman, eh?" says Jerry. 
"Just be careful."
Andrea turns her back to Michael.
"He's no outdoorsman."
Michael opens the door and closes the 
door. Behind him, the muffled sounds of the 
party quickly fade into the silence of the stars. 
His footfalls on the short crisp grass blend 
with the silence. He walks slowly down the 
long hill towards the lake, savoring each step. 
When he looks back he can see the silent party 
through the mist of his breath, and he is 
thankful for the silence. He stops and listens 
to the sound of water rippling against the wet 
earth. Sound and silence exchange with the 
rhythm of the waves.
A truck drives across the bridge on the 
other side of the lake, and a metallic thunder 
skims the water surface. Michael turns his 
back to the lake until it passes. He stoops to 
the earth and lifts a small flat rock. Layers of 
shale pressed flat and tight flake off gently in 
his hand as he gazes at the smoke drifting 
from the chimney of the cabin. He turns 
quickly, flinging the rock sharply across the 
water. He counts the skips until the rock is 
swallowed by darkness. Drying leaves on the 
trees rustle behind him in the breeze. He
looks up to the stars and the line of clouds on 
the horizon, and decides that there are no 
stars in the city.
Arm cocked with another stone and he 
is trotting along the uneven bank as stars and 
wind and water surround him. Things he is 
and was and never was stir in the black air and 
the black water. Laughing, running, he throws 
again and the stone flies crazily in the air as 
the earth is knocked out from under him and 
he slides toward the waves. When he opens 
his eyes he is on his back, staring at the stars.
He blinks slowly, the stars surround 
him and the water laps at the leg of his jeans. 
"Shit," he says as he props himself up on his 
elbows. He pulls himself out of the water and 
reaches to the slick black ground: a plastic 
garbage bag. It's all civilized, he can hear 
himself saying. Cold and wet, he tries to stand 
but the leg will not support him, and he feels 
like he is a character in a Readers'. Digest True 
Life Drama. Clouds diffuse the starlight 
overhead as he tries again to prop himself up. 
The breeze on his soaked jeans makes him 
shiver as he manages to stand precariously on 
the bank. He gets back on his knees and 
begins to crawl up the hill, looking back to the 
approaching clouds then ahead to the distant 
light on the hill, ignoring the flat rocks that 
scrape by under his knees. As a raindrop hits 
his forehead, he wonders if he could somehow 
use the plastic bag to his benefit, to keep him 
dry. But it had been abandoned long ago, so 
that by now it is full of holes and mud and 
water. As he nears the top of the hill, he 
dreads crawling back through the door that he 
had walked out of standing erect. He dreads 
wearing the strange clothes they will give him, 
the drowsy fire in front of which they will prop 
him, the fine hot coffee and Kahlua they will 
offer.

and the landscaped hills of the industrial park.
Michael calls Century-21 and asks for 
Andrea. "Let's go somewhere this weekend. 
Maybe D.C." He hears the faint mechanical 
ring of another call from somewhere else to 
somewhere else. "1 like D.C."
"Michael," says Andrea, "my boss 
Jerrys party is this weekend. We have to go."
"We have to go?" He taps his pen and 
watches Fisher pour a cup of coffee and laugh 
with the secretary. What's her name again?
"Yes, we have to go. Anyway, it'll be 
fun. It's at his cabin in the mountains. What 
could be more relaxing than that?"
Michael sees stars and moon as they 
stroll along the edge of a lake at midnight, but 
he is really watching the trail of white diffuse 
in the sky. "I need to relax."
"You'll relax," says Andrea. "It's in the 
mountains. We have to go."
At noon Michael walks down the cor
ridor made of the outsides of offices. "Ready 
to go?" he says as he swings into Jim's door
way, but Jim has already gone.
Its an uphill battle down to the first 
floor during lunch. Everybody grabs hold, 
pulls himself, herself, down. Each descending 
to the summit of the front door, to cars and 
styrofoam lunches. Michael stands close to 
them and watches the elevator doors open 
and close on the hungry crowds that seem to 
grow larger the closer they get to the ground. 
On the second floor he exits the elevator, 
takes the stairwell down the final floor. His 
footsteps echo up as he descends the empty 
shaft. He half expected at least one person to 
follow him here. He looks up the spiralling 
stairs and wonders at how far from the ground 
the people on the second floor are.
Michael awakes to Saturday morning, a 
hazy beam of orange sunlight at the foot of the 
bed. He opens his eyes. He has stayed in bed 
long after the shower stopped running. It's 
late, he has to get up. He stretches, rubs his 
eyes, props up on his elbows. Michael and 
Andrea smile at him from a picture on the 
dresser.
The cold highway, warmed by sun and 
tires, is immobile, unyielding. It curls out in 
front of them as the setting sun disappears in 
Michael's mirror around the last bend. Mi
chael nods as the wavy surface rocks the car 
with soft rhythm.
"We're going to be late," says Andrea.
He reaches over to touch her knee. 
"We'll make it. Relax." His hand hesitates 
there a moment, then returns to the wheel as 
his eyes watch the white lines and pebbles at 
the side of the road.
"We'll be there in thirty minutes," he 
says. It's thirty minutes later there, from his 
perspective. Right now, they're walking 
through the front door. Only it's thirty min
utes from now. Michael measures distances 
on the highway in time, not miles. Keep a two 
second margin between you and the car in 
front.
Side roads make the trip more interest
ing. Michael watches them slip by in the nar
row horizons that the highway offers. He 
looks back to the highway and wishes that he 
could drive the car right off the edge, through 
the fences, across the fields. But there is no 
exit here.
Michael looks to the dash and then to 
Andrea. She sits quietly, eyes closed, breath
ing.
"We have to stop," says Michael.
Andrea opens her eyes, turns to Mich
ael. The window is a blur of lines behind her 
head. "What?"
"We have to stop. The oil light just 
came on."
Once when Michael had been driving 
all night he fell asleep at the wheel and had 
awakened doing fifty down the grassy median 
strip. Andrea told him how lucky he was that 
he had drifted to the center rather that to the 
edge. You could be dead now, she had said. 
He suddenly feels an urge to jump out at 
seventy and run as fast as he can to the caged 
trees, cropped off at the side of the highway. 
But the barren freeway offers no rock to hide 
behind, no side road that isn't fenced off to 
him.
Michael pulls to the right and the car 
sails down off of the highway. The tires hum 
with deceleration and friction and eventually 
come to a stop next to a battered gasoline 
pump. The attendant wipes his greasy hands 
as he emerges from the station.
"Oil's low," says Michael; then to 
Andrea: "Looks clean."
"I'm not getting out."
"I need some fresh air," says Michael.
A truck rumbles by on the horizon, 
and turns its headlights on as Michael 
watches. He turns to the attendant. "You live 
around here?"
The attendant nods. "All my life. It's 
gonna take two quarts."
Michael nods. As they merge again 
with the highway, he still nods to the rolling 
surface, and the machine he doesnt under
stand responds beneath him. He pushes the 
gas pedal, the brake pedal. When it rains he 
flicks a switch and windshield wipers appear

---------------------------------------------------


V PERFECT EXIT 
Bill Blake
Michael awakes again tonight and feels 
that he is as real and solid as the orange halo 
of the streetlight outside his window. His 
mind blanks at two AM, or three AM, or four, 
creating a hollow that waits for replacement 
that never seems to come. The empty night 
and his empty mind converge, pass through 
each other without touching, like sun and fog 
on an autumn morning, and he wants to be 
someone else, somewhere else. He stares out 
of the bedroom window. A grey cat saunters 
by at the edge of his blue lawn. The colors 
seem wrong. One night when I was sitting up, 
thinks Michael, I saw a cat under the lamppost 
on my quiet suburban street. The cat sits 
and licks its paw, breathing the cold misty air.
A rustle of sheets in the darkness 
behind tells him that he is not alone, but he 
does not turn around. Suddenly aware of win
dow frames and curtains and walls, he puts his 
hand to the cold glass and a mist forms 
around his fingers and palm, diffusing the 
streetlight.
"What's wrong, Michael?" says Andrea, 
stretching. "Come to bed."
The dream is not a recurring one, yet 
it somehow seems familiar. But he can't tell 
Andrea. He would tell her, but he knows she 
wouldn't show concern. Andrea's not one to 
let dreams worry her. She knows reality.
He removes his hand from the window 
and peers through the vanishing hand print, 
but the cat is gone. A perfect exit, but Michael 
thinks that the cat has probably crawled up 
under the hood of his car where it's warm (he 
should remember to check that in the morn
ing). He leaves the night and goes to Andrea, 
running his cold wet hand through his 
rumpled hair.
The sanity of morning arrives in a me
chanical buzz and a pale purple sky. Michael 
buries his head deep in the pillow as he listens 
to water falling onto porcelain tile and An
drea's skin. He rises when the water stops; the 
silence is his alarm.
Coffee steams in Michael's cup and he gulps it 
quickly even though he knows it will give him 
stomach cramps on the freeway.
"I'm so tired," he says.
Andrea places the jelly knife gently on 
the edge of her plate and lifts an english muffin 
to within an inch of her mouth. "That's be
cause you don't sleep."
"Same thing every morning. Showers 
and coffee."
"Same thing," echoes Andrea. "You 
should really see someone, honey. You have 
to learn to relax."
He yawns and fills his cup again, turns 
to her grinning out of the side of his mouth.
"I'm going to pay someone to teach me to 
relax."
"Well," she swallows, looking up out of 
the corner of her eye, "well we have the 
money. What are we working for?"
"I know. We have the money." He 
glances at the clock and then stares at a fading 
star outside the window. "Id better get going."
The soft blue interior of Michael's car 
cradles him as acetylene lights flash by in cold 
hard orange streaks. He smokes a cigarette 
and breathes the artificial air from the heater. 
Outside it is cold. The air swirling in from the 
slightly open window makes his hand cold on 
the wheel, but the chill keeps him awake as 
the heat offers comfort to his feet. He watches
 
 
the lights go out at random, sometimes at the 
moment before he passes under them. All 
over town, lights going out. The sky is blue. It 
is Friday.
Allegheny Industrial Park, Building #3, 
looms a white monolith through the wind
shield as Michael reaches to the passenger 
seat for his briefcase. He might even be 
impressed by the building, were it not for the 
ten others, identical, which surround him. A 
monolith in a sea of monoliths. His hand 
hesitates on the worn handle for a moment as 
he looks up to his window. Michael knows 
what floor his office is on without thinking of a 
number, and this is probably why he has so 
much trouble deter-mining which window is 
his. He reminds himself to place something 
unique there, but the windows are mirrored.
It doesn't matter which one is his, he figures. 
Monolith #3. Any window will do.
The thin walls of Michael's office offer 
no structural support to the building. He 
would call them what they arepartitionsbut 
for the strange looks he would receive from 
his co-workers. Anyway, they exist as walls, 
like aluminum siding exists to be wood. He 
knows that as long as they are called walls 
they will be walls. The constant flow of people 
to the coffee machines directly outside his 
door makes him feel that he always has to look 
busy. He wonders how in a building of identi
cal rooms that he could have ended up with 
the worst one.
Jim Fisher looks in and waves: "Mikedo lunch?" Michael nods but Jim has already 
turned to talk to one of the secretaries who is 
stirring artificial sweetener into a styrofoam 
cup. Out the tinted window, an unseen air
plane leaves a trail of white above the freeway

Realing The Dream: Two Movements
She pulls me out of bed and music's a turn on, we sit on the Boston apartment 
I. window ledge where we talk like hungry raptors. She tells me she is ready to handcuff my wrists
in cufflinks, to reconnect this abstraction of ours into one tight string.
Still fist in fist our nervous fingers eat each others hands. Suddenly we are falling 
towards someplace else under the parasol of distant radio music.
From a saddled giraffe 
she slips off this page 
into laughter
the way my eyes move 
down the arch of her
back to her hips.
She turns on her side
and in silent 
marimba notes 
she coils around herself.
She reaches for the end 
table and takes an apple, 
puts it in her elastic mouth 
and swallows hard. The core
of the apple is my heart 
and the best about me is her.

TV Ruling
The day Naomi told her lover that she was 
pregnant, he went for a five mile run in the snow 
wearing shorts. Shed purposely sprung the news on him 
in the middle of the spinach souffle knowing he was 
going to choke on it. Any other way would have drawn 
nothing more than an astonished stare, and she wasnt 
about to stumble through a conversation with herself. 
Instead, she made him cough a little before he fled from 
the table in search of his sneakers.
Shed only told him because she thought hed 
get suspicious when she started wearing tent-like tee 
shirts with huge arrows printed on them, arrows stabbing 
at her stomach and announcing BABY or PRECIOUS 
CARGO. Shed expected him to fly from the apartment 
as he had, wrapping a bandana around his round, little 
head, muttering something about discussing this later 
after he got some fresh air.
So, she helped herself to a dish of lemon jello 
and waited for him to come back in from the snow. She 
slurped on the spoon and stalked around the apartment 
kicking socks under chairs out of sight.
After Naomi had dropped the news of her 
pregnancy and Sal had returned to her with cold, soggy 
feet and a runny nose, he remarked that his fiance wasnt 
going to like this at all. Sherrie, his bride to be, was at 
home just then, probably picking out pretty invitations 
and pricing caterers. What was he going to say?
"Honey, Im going to be a father. Be sure to get that 
radiant glow in his eye?
"How could this happen? he groaned.
You mean, you dont know ? She scraped 
cold souffle into a trash can.
Youre not planning on having this taken care 
of, are you? he asked.
Taken care of? She stopped so that she 
could stare at him.
An abortion," he replied. She almost ex
pected him to spell the word out for her. Maybe pull one 
of those second grade flash cards from his pocket: a-bo-r-t-i-o-n. Use that word in a sentence.
I cant do that," she answered. Catholics 
dont do that. You should know we dont, Sal.
I thought Catholics didnt screw around 
before they got married, either." It was the boldest thing 
shed ever heard him say, and all she could think was 
that the shock of this was truly starting to affect him.
Come on Sal, Im not that Catholic. She 
smirked and blew a long finger of smoke into his face. 
She prided herself on the ability to clean bakeware and 
smoke a Camel at the same time. He glared and said 
hed have to marry her.
What makes you think Im keeping it?" she 
drawled. I certainly wouldnt kill it, but Im not about 
to keep it, either."
I cant believe you. You have to marry me. 
She could see him already planning to have Sherries 
ring enlarged a few sizes to fit her finger.
What do you want from me, Sal? I dont love 
you. You dont love me. And little white kids are in 
high demand these days. She ran the glass baking pan 
under a stream of steaming water.
He just stood there seriously hoping shed 
bum her hands or drop the pan so it would shatter all 
over the floor, but she just slouched calmly against the 
sink and finished scrubbing the dish.
Naomi lived alone in a cramped, little apart
ment in Queens. Five days a week, she sold what she 
called "funky clothes from a tiny shop in the Village. 
Having grown up in suburbia, she was doing some
thing shed always dreamed about, only now it seemed 
much less glamorous. The place was dark and every
thing looked old and dusty. The middle-aged owner 
had seen her mass of curly, dark hair and hired her 
right away. She was tall and solid, not skinny, yet 
somehow cat-like with huge green eyes that she lined 
Cleopatra-style, thick bands of black curling up at the 
edges of the lids. He thought she would draw custom
ers and sometimes she did. Shed seen Sal one day 
touching a silky teddy trimmed with fake leopard fur.
He was fascinated by the thing, and she 
couldnt help saying, You Tarzan? instead of her 
usual, Do you need any help?
He flushed and sputtered something aboi:- a
fiance.
She Jane? She was on a roll.
No," he stammered, his milky eyes pleading 
with her.
"Oh, Im sorry, she finished, Its these long 
days. I get carried away sometimes.
This realy isnt Sherries style, any way, he 
offered shoving it back onto the rack with the others.
No? It looks great on, though." His eyes 
darted from ther floor to her face and then dropped to 
the strings of beads swinging from her loose, faded 
shirt. She thought how much he looked like a little, 
dark monkey and smiled at him. He glanced back, 
grinned and suddenly realized that he was clutching at 
the rack of lingerie behind him.

They had dinner once or twice a week after 
that at Naomis place. They usually talked about his 
job at Pablos Pettery which she thought was a porno 
shop until he told her that they mostly sold goldfish 
and sometimes a parrot or two. He was saving money 
until he could afford to go back to N.Y.U., he said. He 
liked the way Naomi cooked; she was working her 
way through the Betty Crocker Cookbook and had 
made it all the way to S  spinach souffle  before 
accidently getting pregnant.
A few months after the announcement, 
Naomi moved to Sandy Hook to stay with her father 
for a while. The middle-aged owner liked her much 
less now that she was shaped like a beach ball and 
suggested she take a leave of absence. Her father was 
a shadowy man who seemed much older than sixty. 
Having sold his 18-wheeler two years ago, he settled 
down near the sea and spent most of his time softly 
strumming his guitar in the comers of his rooms, 
scribbling down pieces of arrangements that never left 
the house.
If he was surprised by his daughters preg
nancy, he didnt show it. "Too bad your mama wasnt 
here to help you out, was what he said. That showed 
how much he knew about the two of them, Naomi 
thought. For the first eleven years of her life, shed 
known him as the man in the greasy, flannel shirt who 
handed her things like Canadian coins and plastic keychains from Louisiana. Later, she bragged about a dad 
who couldnt make it to the parent-teacher conferences 
because he traveled all across the country. Now she sat 
on the needlepoint cushions of his couch eating Italian 
ice and listening to him botch up the latest piece of 
Bach he was trying to learn.
Her mother had finished stitching those 
pillows right before she died four years ago of a 
heart attack. Shed been carrying to much weight 
for too long; the doctor had told them it clogged 
and eventually smothered her heart. Shed tried 
forever to take it off and hated herself for never 
being able to do it, mostly because she couldnt 
stand her own appearance. So, she sat in the house 
sewing most of the time and nagged Naomi who, 
like most kids her age, never wanted to stay home. 
There were screaming matches about everything 
from milk-rimmed glasses on Naomis bedroom 
floor to boys shed been seen with under the 
boardwalk. Looking back, the young woman 
knew that life with her mother was never horrible, 
just stifling.
One day in June, Naomi sat on a jetty 
suspended far into the sea. An eighth of a mile 
away, she spotted a man and little boy fishing 
from another stretch of rock. The man stood a few 
feet from his son and was hunched over, hands on 
knees so he wouldnt rip the pole away from the 
little kid. The child jumped around clinging to the 
rod, feeling the violent twist of a fish struggling to 
free itself from his clutches. She thought of a little 
person swimming on its string inside of her and 
imagined it, wet and wriggling, ankles in a doctors 
fist, a gaping mouth sucking for air. She would 
never have to see that baby breathe; shed never 
have to see it crawl or cry or die. Shed never 
have to care, she thought, and turned her head 
back toward the shore.
In August, Sal came after her. The pet shop had 
given him two weeks paid vacation. He brought 
her a black kitten as a gift, and she figured he was 
probably hoping he'd stir some maternal emotion 
by giving her the baby animal. Naomi made him 
take her out to Long Branch where there was a 
boardwalk.
I want you to come home and marry 
me, he said.
Sal, I already told you to keep your 
ring. What happened to Sherrie? Hook up with 
her and you may even have a chance at having a 
blond, little baby. Theyre so much more striking 
any way." She was stringing along a bunch of 
blue and green balloons that Sal had bought her 
because they were the colors of the sea. The sea 
was just grey, she thought, and decided he spent 
way too much time in the city watching cartoons.
I cant stand the thought of some child I pro
duced stranded in a strangers family.
What the hell are you talking about, Sal?
Just seven months ago, you were asking me if I were 
going to get rid of it. She stopped to watch some sea 
gulls tearing at a soggy lump of bread on the sand and 
set the kitten down to charge at them.
Hey, I was making sure you weren't getting 
rid of it, remember? And, any way, that was before I 
really had a chance to think about it.
Before your parents laid on the great guilt 
trip, you mean.
Im twenty-four, Naomi, my parents dont 
run my life any more.
Bullshit they dont. Tell me they didnt 
strongly suggest you come after me.
His eyes followed the kitten as it pounced at 
the clump of bread scattering gulls in all directions. 
Look, if were gonna talk about running home to 
daddy... He let that sentence hang in the air with the 
salt.
Cut it out, Sal. Youre not making me change 
my mind. I knew Mr. and Mrs. Roman Catholic 
wouldnt let this one just slip by. No, right away they 
want wedding bells and a bride. No matter what kind of 
tramp she is.
Youre such a bitch sometimes, he said.
She laughed and popped one of the ballons with the tip 
of her cigarette.
Hate me all you want, Sal. I cant keep this 
kid. I cant marry you. I cant change any of that.
He was peering down at the gum stuck to the 
bottom of his sneaker.
So, she said, do you want your cat back or
what?
The baby came on Halloween. Naomis 
father had driven her to the hospital as soon as the pains 
began, and shed made some joke about how this kid 
was going to be a real little monster. Her father just 
smiled at her with watery, blue eyes; she doubted that 
hed even heard her. Groups of miniature witches and 
vampires scampered over the sidewalks. Naomi tried 
again, God, I hope mine doesnt come out looking like 
that. She slipped another Camel into her mouth.
Should you be doing that? her father asked.
Probably not. She wished Sal had been 
there to drive her to Ocean County General. She rolled 
her eyes upward to watch the black tree branches 
bleeding past the window like splashes of ink against the 
flat, grey sky.
She could see the doctors floating around her 
in their blue, sterile masks and clammy gloves. They told 
her to relax, but she heard a voice screech obscenities at 
them and guessed it was her own. Like a woman 
possessed, she thought. She was sure her skin was 
splitting open, and then it seemed to fall back into place.
The baby was stillborn, they told her, and 
quickly caned away the silent human lump that had come 
from her. She thought she hadnt heard them right but 
woke that evening to a vase of roses sent by Sal, a 
gesture of sympathy. Shed been right; she never had to 
hear it cry, never had to see it suffocate. She turned her 
eyes to the roses and saw one blue balloon hovering 
above the flowers, straining gently against its string.

(T
-Lhe Founder of Carnegie Mellon University, Andrew Carnegie, was born in 
Dunfermline, Scotland. While in Scotland, Carnegie only attended four years of 
school. In 1848 at the age of thirteen, he left Scotland for America with his family 
and settled in what is now Allegheny County. Before his establishment as the 
steel tycoon, Carnegie held many jobs, including telegraph messenger and 
bobbin-boy (which paid $1.20 a week).
In December of 1900, Andrew Carnegie sold his interests in the Carnegie 
company to J. P. Morgan for $400,000,000. Carnegie used the money he made 
from the sale of his steel company in many philanthropic ways, one of which 
was the establishment of the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
During his second visit to campus on April 4,1910, Carnegie spoke to the 
students and described his philosophy towards life. During this speech Carnegie 
eloquently stated, In the struggle for life some of you may place upon yourself 
the ambition to be a multi-millionaire. That is a low ambition... If I had my 
choice I would choose honest poverty rather than money. The ignorant man has 
no ambition but millions. The man who is educated does not care for money.

Back in the old days, Campus Week was the term 
used in reference to Spring Carnival. The purpose 
behind this activity was to bring the alumni of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology back to the school 
and cement student-alumni relations. Many activities 
were offered, such as a Vaudeville Show, Circus, and 
of course, Sweepstakes (buggy). There was also 
something known as "The Call," where the honorary 
fraternities announced their pledges and a funeral 
oration was given. During The Call, a new link was 
added to what was known as the Carnegie Chain. 
This chain had links for every class to graduate from 
the Institute. The link of the freshmen class was added 
during Campus Week, and upon graduation the year 
of the class was engraved upon it. The class to 
graduate 25th had their link plated silver in honor of 
the occasion.
Another oddity of Campus Week was the daily 
newspaper known first as The Campus Scavenger in 
1923, The Sporran in 1924, the Campus Courier in 
1925, and the Campus Squeak in 1926. This spoof 
on Campus Week and the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology in general was sponsored by Pi Delta 
Epsilon. It ran headlines like: R.O.T.C. Revolts; Wont 
Wear Whiskers and stories like one about a professor 
who was allegedly booked by the police for 
attempting to steal a podium.
Sandy McCallys Guide to Campus Week 1924 also 
lampooned Campus Week. According to the editors 
of this handbook, . . . every publication on campus 
is but a tool in the hands of vicious propagandists and 
therefore we have prepared this unbiased volume of 
valuable information. .."
This valuable information offered advice on such 
topics as What every man should know before he 
graduates and the definition of a fraternity. This was 
definitely the book to have!

Freshmen bury regulations and Mrs. 
Hamerschlag breaks ground.
In the early years of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, Freshmen had to abide by Freshmen 
regulations. Freshmen should never talk to members 
of the opposite sex while on campus. The beanie was 
required for male freshmens heads while outside. 
Every freshman had to wear black Plebe socks and 
ties. There was even a handbook given every 
freshmen upon entering Carnegie Tech that listed the 
regulations to be followed by the men and women of 
the freshmen class. Trials were also held by the .Senate 
President of the respective colleges once per week to 
punish criminal freshmen. Female students were not 
exempt from these Riles, either. The students of 
Maggie Murphy College were allowed to wear only 
the regulation armband and only one necessary pin, a 
watch and a fraternity pin. Freshmen women could 
use only the right hand stairwells and bulletin boards. 
All freshmen except art students were required to sit 
in the last rows for school assemblies. The freshmen 
art students, who had to wear green smocks,were 
seated in the front row.
These little handbooks contained calenders of 
campus events in the back with little quotes like: The 
shows, the queens, the sporty clothes are not for you, 
Plebe, and Dont forget, studies before pleasure. At 
.the end of their first year, the freshmen students put 
their little handbooks in a coffin and held a mock 
funeral. They had pallbearers, black clothes, the 
works! The idea behind this was that they were 
burying freshmen regulations. I wonder why this 
great custom didnt survive the years. . .

Prestigious faculty 
from Germany 
joined staff.
Hamerschlag built the buildings, but Baker built the 
campus.
It was during Bakers administration that the campus 
began to change into an atmosphere of calm serenity 
unlike the construction days of early Tech. Lawns, 
trees, sidewalks began to appear. Flag poles went up, 
an open air theater was created and a grove of trees 
was planted for those who had died in World War I.
The prow of the University, behind what is now 
Hamerschlag Hall, was placed during this time. It is 
the bronze bow ornament of the USS Pennsylvania 
and was given to the University by the government 
when it was dismantled.
During his administration Baker showed himself to 
be a builder of minds and bodies of the students. The 
Gymnasium was built in 1924 and still stands at the 
comer of Frew and Margaret Morrison. We didnt win 
the first game played when Tech faced Pitt in 
basketball and lost in overtime with a score of 29-26, 
but there have been others since that we have.
One of the more interesting ideas of Baker followed 
was his feeling that the education an engineer was not 
complete if he could not write and speak clearly. As 
many writers in the past ten years have complained of 
illiteracy of high school and college students so did 
Baker. He believed that students should be able to 
master their mother tongue so much that he said 
students who fail to write clearly and correctly should 
[not] be given a diploma by a college.
Bakers administration also saw guidance for the 
spirit emerge as the first chapel services took place. 
Invocations began to appear in many of the academic 
occasions. Graduation exercises also began to stretch 
out as the simple address and conference of degrees 
were appended with a sermon, scriptures, prayer, 
responsive reading, hymns, and even a large choir.
Baker also began the long road that Carnegie Tech 
would follow into the future: research. Night classes
created a major portion of the student body with 
many people working around Pittsburgh coming to 
Tech at night. The influence of these outside 
researchers coming to the Institute to brush up on 
subjects helped Baker to create research projects that 
could be done at Carnegie Tech.
He held three conferences on bituminous coal 
during his tenure as president and was planning a 
fourth when he retired. These conferences were 
international in nature and were very important to a 
world that expected coal to be the fuel of the future. 
Baker was also able to establish a Coal Research 
Laboratory at Tech in 1930 with funds from many 
local and far businesses. These included the Buhl 
foundation as the largest contributor and also the Steel 
Corporation (probably today USX), General Electric, 
Koppers, New York Edison, Westinghouse and the 
Standard Oil company (today Exxon).
Other departments also prospered under the Baker 
administration with some part of the credit going to 
Adolf Hitler. As the Nazi government policies became 
enforced in 1933 German universities and scientists 
were unsure of their futures. Other countries offered 
refuge for these scholars and President Baker made a 
trip to Europe to give Techs offers. He trip was 
successful and he gained three German professors to 
do research in chemistry and physics for Tech.
His many duties as president of Carnegie Tech were 
added on by the government. He accepted a position 
from the President of the United States to be the 
impartial chairman of the Regional Labor Board of 
Pittsburgh. This additional position caused a great 
deterioration in Bakers health and he soon retired 
from the University in 1935 and was named the first 
President Emeritus.

After that, though, it was downhill for Tech and its 
football program. The next year was a losing season 
for the Tartans and interest waned. There was no 
football field on campus then and the school had to 
rent time at either Forbes Field or Pitt Stadium. 
President Doherty concluded that little Carnegie Tech 
could no longer afford the costs of big-time football 
and scaled down the program. Tech did not win the 
Lambert Trophy again until 1979-

into December as the Tartans played the college

and Pitt Stadium.
Attendance at Tech football games during that 
period topped out at over 60,000 fans  roughly the 
amount of people who watch four seasons worth of 
Carnegie Mellon games currently.

Earlier this month the Department of Energy 
announced that Texas would be the site of the worlds 
largest particle accelerator, but for a brief time in the 
1950s Carnegie Institute of Technology held that 
distinction.
The syncho-cyclotron, which began operation in 
1950, was one of Carnegie Mellons first ventures into 
large research projects. It was located on 60 acres near 
Saxonburg, Pennsylvania.
President Doherty concluded that establishing the 
Nuclear Research Center was the most important 
achievement of his administration.
The project was initiated shortly after World War II. 
The University contributed $300,000 to the project, 
which was matched by the Buhl Foundation. The 
Navy and some businesses contributed $1,200,000.
Dr. Roger B. Sutton, who was director of the Center 
in the 1950s, explained the situation after the war, 
people suddenly realize what physics could do  
reactors, the bomb, radar. There was a feeling that 
physics should be supported for two reasons: to 
develop the physics community and things physicists 
did were useful. Sutton, who is retired now in some 
sense, still maintains an office on the eighth floor of 
Wean Hall overlooking the Mall.
Sutton and the physics department head, Dr. Edward
C. Creutz, both witnessed the explosion of the first 
atomic bomb at Alamagordo, N.M. as technical 
consultants. Approximately one-fifth of the
GSIA founded.
Carnegie-Mellon students

during Spring Carnival.
engineering and science staff at Tech was involved 
with the war effort. Carnegie Tech received the 
Ordinance Distinguish Service Award for its efforts.
At first the University intended to have the Center on 
campus, but because the cyclotron was one and a half 
hours of driving time away from campus, physics 
professors arranged their teaching schedules to 
accommodate the research which they conducted 
there. The department ran a bus shuttle between 
campus and the Center.
in January 1948 Carnegie Tech purchased the 
property which was the former location of the 
KDKA radio transmitter, in Saxonburg, from 
Westinghouse for the cyclotron. Ground was 
broken in March for the laboratory.
The magnetic coils for the particle accelerator were 
wound at the Brooklyn Naval Yards. Because their size 
made it difficult to transport them over land from New 
York to Pennsylvania, they were shipped by barge 
down the Atlantic and up the Mississippi, Ohio, and 
Allegheny Rivers.
The cyclotron studied particles such as protons, 
neutrons, mesons, and muons. The facility attracted 
researchers interested in high-energy physics to 
Carnegie Tech, which has continued to the present. 
Most experiments in particle physics done today are 
conducted at national accelerator laboratories.

Contrary to popular belief, Baker's halls do not slope 
because Andrw Carnegie was pessimistic about the future 
of the school and was prepared to turn it into a factory. 
The architect simply wanted to echo the feeling of 
walking on the sloping sidewalks outside on the Mall.
The tradition of embedding brass plates to represent 
each class in the entrance floor of Baker Hall is about to 
be revived  tiles for the classes from 1971 to 1988 will 
be laid next year. In addition, each of the present four 
classes will have their tiles displayed until they are 
embedded.
Mrs. Hamerschlag assigned each color in the Carnegie 
Tartan (generally the Cameron of Erracht tartan) to 
represent the four schools  blue for Engineering, red 
for Arts, green for Industries, and yellow for the Women's 
School.
Rubbing Hamerschlag's nose in the entrance of Baker 
Hall guarantees luck for tests.
The underground network of steam tunnels is strictly off

Imagine life at CMU without Skibo, Warner Mali, 
Donner, Morewood, Mudge, Doherty, Hamerschlag, 
or Hunt Library. Margaret Morrison was a womens 
college not yet combined with Carnegie Tech, in 
which women studied how to be secretaries and 
homemakers. This was CMU at the start of the 
Warner Administration.
The Warner period, which lasted until 1965, was a 
time of unprecedented growth and expansion of the 
campus, as well as a variety of student activities and 
traditions, some of which are still present at CMU 
today. All of the above buildings were started and 
completed during this time, and the fraternitydormitory complexes were created as the answer to 
spatial and financial problems the school had with 
the fraternities.
Although this time period lacked the excitement of 
World War II before it, and the rebellion of the late 
60s that came after it,.students managed to engage in 
a number of activities, the biggest of which were the 
Fall Festival and Spring Carnival.
The Fall Festival involved sorority competitions in 
singing and dancing, the homecoming football game 
and celebrations, as well as a fraternity competition 
in which each group decorated its house with 
intricate displays according to various themes.
Spring Carnival was not only a weekend of rides, 
games, and competitions as it is today, but one of 
ceremony as well. In addition to the fraternity buggy 
(called pushmobiles) and booth competitions, there 
were sorority competitions and relays, and what was 
called Coronation and Call Day. This ceremony of 
calling the honors students and the crowning of the 
Spring Carnival Queen occurred on the Saturday of 
Carnival, with President Warner running the events 
and the Cameron Choir singing in between. In the 
afternoon a parade proceeded up Forbes and Marga
ret Morrison streets, with the Kiltie Band in the lead, 
the Queens float second, and the remaining floats 
built by the various fraternities following. This 
tradition of float building, although very popular, was
ended after a fire broke out one year.
Carnival ended on Saturday night with a Formal 
dance and awards ceremony at which the fashion 
column in The Tartan suggested that women wear "a 
sweetly feminine powder-puff muslin gown, edged 
with blue velvet ribbons, and a corsage of violets to 
complete the picture."
The most popular event of Spring Carnival (besides 
the buggy sweepstakes) was the presentation of the 
Scotch n Soda show, originally performed on 
Thursday night but in later years extended to play 
three to four nights during Carnival.
Scotch n Soda was probably one of the largest and 
most diverse student organizations on campus during 
this time, with up to 200 students with majors ranging 
from engineering and secretarial studies to drama, 
art, and architecture. Preparations began early in the 
fall semester to produce a musical comedy or revue 
that was entirely written, directed, performed, and 
produced by undergraduate students.
These two-act productions, which were performed 
at Carnegie Music Hall, often involved the work of 
technical crews of 10 or more, shoreographers, 
lighting crews, music composers, and 20-piece 
orchestras. The set designs were different from year 
to year, ranging from intricate revolving stages to 
simple, traditional stages. The programs for the 
shows were often 12 pages long, with extensive 
biographies of the various crews, as well as pictures 
of the actual production. This enormous popularity of 
Scotch 'n' Soda lasted past the end of the Warner 
Administration, and the group continue in its efforts at 
producing quality shows with a diverse student 
membership.

Theres a battle outside 
And it is ragin.
Itll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin.
 Bob Dylan, "The Times They Are A-changin 
During the H. Guyford Stever Administration, many 
changes to the University came about. Mellon Institute 
and CIT merged to form Camegie-Mellon University. 
The Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women 
was phased out and the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences was founded.
Across the nation, another change was occurring. 
Students, for the first time, began to rally on their 
college campuses against political issues such as 
racism, male dominance, and die Vietnam War.
CMU was one of these campuses.
There is a growing concern within the academic 
community about the nature of the life of man in the 
twentieth century, commented Stever in an open 
letter to The Tartan in September of 1969.
The Vietnam War sparked student action on campus: 
CMU became the Strike Data Center for the North
eastern United States, responsible for publishing a 
monthly newsletter to update information on student 
strikes in the area. Student protestors actually "took 
the gym for a day.
Anti-war groups such as Effete Snobs for Peace 
(ESP), Student Mobilization Committee (SMC), and 
Students Against War (SAW) were formed. In addition, 
a Peace and Freedom Center was set up at 618 South 
Millvale Avenue.
CMU students took part in the March Against Death
in Washington, D.C., on November 13-15, 1969. 
Students from across the country carried wooden 
placards bearing the name of a soldier killed in 
Vietnam and placed them in a large coffin outside the 
White House.
A campus protest took place against Dow Chemical 
Company because of its production of napalm.
May 4, 1970, a memorial demonstration was held on 
the Cut for the Kent State students killed during their 
campus protest. Student Senate then called a morato
rium on all University activities, including classes and 
exams, until Monday, May 11.
The merging of MI and CIT also caused student 
upheaval. Students felt that the Mellon family and big 
business had come to dominate the Board of Trustees, 
and consequently the University. A flyer regarding a 
plan to have a picnic on R.K. Mellons front lawn at 
his Ligonier estate commented, We should come as a 
freaky political pressure group, a bunch of happy 
serfs advocating that Mellon seek political office in the 
next Pennsylvania election as King. We should want 
Mellon to be King because, as we have learned, he 
has the power now anyway.
In a 1969 report entitled Camegie-Mellon Univer
sity: An Analysis of Ownership and Control by David 
Greenberg, the President of Harvard criticized student 
protestors: .. they see our universities taken over by
the business and military establishments lock, stock, 
and barrel...they say our universities are devoted to 
the present and future domination of the people of 
the world  both in Vietnam and in our urban 
ghettos. Obviously they live in a world of fantasy.

Although not many people seem to know it, five 
symbolic cotton banners are an important part of 
CMUs ceremonial history. The banners were first 
hung during commencement in the niches alongside 
CFA. Each of the five bore the symbol of a particular 
college and boasted patches of the Tartan plaid 
uniting them as a university. The College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences was represented by a 
unicorn; The Carnegie Institute of Technology by a 
thistle; Mellon Institute by blue bells; The Fine Arts 
college by a red dragon; and The Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration (GSIA) and The School of 
Urban and Public Affairs (SUPA) jointly represented 
by two mirror image griffins  mythological figures 
with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a 
lion. These banners were designed in 1964 and sewn 
together by modern day Betsy Ross Elizabeth Bes 
Kimberly. Today, like Bes, they are still honoring 
CMU with their presence as an important part of the 
universitys historical tradition.
Elizabeth Schrader Kimberly joined the university 
faculty in 1928, having received a B.A. in Drama that 
same year. Serving as teacher and costume designer 
for the next forty years, Bes says that her resulting 
1968 retirement didnt take so she remained at CMU, 
taking on the additional responsibilities of the annual 
Drama Newsletter and her current position as the 
Drama Department Historian. Bes has also written a 
partial history of the Drama Department and is 
presently working on its latest edition.
The newsletter is now in its thirty-first edition and 
has grown steadily in size from ten purple 
mimeographed pages to become a large printed 
booklet with almost 1000 entries about drama alumni. 
It is one of Bes favorite activities because it is so 
much appreciated by others. Indeed, helping people 
has become a large part of Bes responsibilities; 
students often come to her for advice about 
prospective contacts and I came to her to learn about 
the seemingly forgotten banners.
Originally from Massilon, Ohio, Bes doesnt often 
make it back there anymore, but keeps busy and 
happy with her interest and committment to the 
theatre. She has traveled widely visiting other theatres 
and helping them with their productions. At CMU, 
things have changed, says Bes, but thats only to be 
expected. The times have also changed. She feels 
that the one thing which has remained constant is the 
need for hard work, and students still realize this, 
which is good. They dont need me to tell them what 
to do, she says  her best advice is to wish them 
good luck.
Although Bes may not want to admit it, her 
dedication and commitment to serving the university 
have earned her a place in the hearts of many who 
know her and the work which has contributed to the 
continuance of tradition at CMU.
