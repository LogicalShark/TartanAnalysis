Tech Radio Club 
Makes Big Plans 
For Reactivation
Carnegie Techs recently reacti
vated Radio Club is making elab
orate plans for expansion. The 
club, under whose direction sta
tion W8NKI was recently returned 
to the air, has its headquarters in 
Machinery Hall, Room 400.
The club was under the direc
tion of the Physics Department 
until last summer, at which time 
it was transferred to the sponsor
ship of the Electrical Engineering 
Department. A section of the 
Electronics Laboratory was set off, 
and the equipment was disassem
bled and moved from Engineering 
Hall to Machinery Hall. Due to 
the few interested students during 
the war, there was very little ac
tivity, and the club was reduced 
to only three members. These 
three, Edl Pearlstein, Lou Umbach, 
and Kenny Lipman, set themselves 
up as a reorganization committee 
with Pearlstein as chairman. With 
the help of the faculty advisor, 
Mr. D. L. Trautman, they have 
done a good job.
Recently, Emsworth Johnson re
turned from the Merchant Marine 
to re-enroll at Carnegie. In the 
weeks before the opening of the 
semester, Johnson succeeded in re
building the transmitter and put
ting it back on the air. Since this 
time members of the club have 
made quite a few contacts with 
otlief hams, including one in 
Guatamala City.
The club is planning code prac-, 
tice and theory instruction to en
able those interested to get their 
Amateur Radio Operators Licenses. 
They are also planning to draw up 
a new constitution and to elect 
regular officers. Until such a time 
as reorganization can be accom
plished, Ed Pearlstein is Acting 
President, and Emsworth Johnson 
is Chief Operator. The club is 
open to any interested day or night 
school student of Carnegie Tech 
who shows an interest in radio 
and related subjects.
In the past the Radio Club of 
Carnegie Tech has been well 
known, fairly active, and well 
heard on the network, and it is the 
object of the present members to 
surpass this proud record.
The Radio Club will hold its 
first theory instruction period on 
Saturday, February 16, at 2:00 P. 
M. in room 400 Machinery Hall.
Stardust Swing Promises All 
A Perfect Night Of Dancing
Dr, Warner To 
Receive Award
Dr. John C. Warner, Dean of 
Graduate Studies in the College 
of Engineering and Science, has 
been selected for the Pittsburgh 
award of the American Chemical 
Society. The award will be pre
sented at a formal dinner in the 
University Club, February 21.
Dr. Warner returned to the 
Tech campus after working on 
the atomic bomb for two years. 
His work while away was re
search in plutonium, an atom 
bomb constituent. Later he aided 
in operating the laboratories at 
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
He is a charter member of the 
Pittsburgh Chemists Club, of 
which he was President in 1940. 
Dr. Warner is a fellow of the 
New York Academy of Science 
and a member of the American 
Institute of Mining and Commer
cial Engineers. He has also writ
ten many technical papers  and 
textbooks.
A native of Indiana, Dean War
ner received his doctorate from 
the University of Indiana in 1923. 
He worked as a research chemist 
before joining Techs faculty in 
1926.
The Pittsburgh award of the
A. C. S., a bronze plaque, was es
tablished in 1933 It will be pre
sented to Dr. Warner by Mr. Rob
ert M. Wenzel of The Westinghouse Research Laboratories, 
chairman of the Pittsburgh sec
tion of the society.
New Organization 
Will Take Charge 
Of Plebe Bible
Publication of the Student 
Handbook, commonly known as 
the Plebe Bible, will be returned 
to a regular publications organ
ization this semester. During the 
war, Pi Delta Epsilon, journal
ism honorary, had assumed re
sponsibility for its publication, 
after Tri-Publications stopped op
erating. Now that publication 
will be returned to a regular stu
dent group and PiDE will as
sume the responsibility for re
organization.
Pi Delta Epsilon has appointed 
Augie Binder as chairman of a 
committee responsible for reacti
vation of the Handbook as a pub
lication. No definite plans have 
as yet been made, but details of 
organization will be announced 
later. All persons wno are inter
ested in working on the 1946-47 
Handbook are asked to contact 
Augie Binder this week, either 
through interschool mail or the 
Deans Office.
Included in the Handbook is in
formation on camp\is activities, 
organizations,- regulations, ftnd 
other general information of in
terest to students. The work in
volved in getting out the Bible 
will consist of complete revision 
and rewriting of all information 
in view of new conditions on cam
pus.
Tri-publications, the organiza
tion formerly responsible for the 
publication of the Plebe Bible, al
so was in charge of the Student 
Directory or C Book and the 
Carnegie Song Book. It is not 
known yet whether or not this new 
group will assume the responsibil
ities of the old Tri-Publications; 
plans call only for the revision 
and publication of the Handbook 
this semester and over the first 
part of the summer.
Life Begins at Forty for Tartan
Recent Alterations 
Bring Little Comment
The last edition of the Tartan 
represented a radical departure 
from the Tartans of previous 
years. The makeup and masthead 
were new, and the paper was 
considerably larger in quantity 
and quality. The history behind 
these improvements is a long and 
an interesting one.
At the banquet on Nov. 29 of 
the journalistic honory, Pi Delta 
Epsilon, Professor Siegfried, Head 
of the Printing Department, ex
pressed strong disapproval of the 
school newspaper. Specifically, its 
style had become stagnantno 
change since 1939and the four 
column set-up was a waste of 
space, for most national ads were 
composed or the .standard five 
columns. Also, a more appealing 
masthead was needed to attract 
reader attention. Since some of 
the Tartans executives were 
members of this honorary, they 
took this criticism to heart and 
decided to do something about it.
Meetings of the staff under edit[continued on page 8]
Notice
Any student, new or old, 
freshman through senior, who 
is interested in writing, inter
viewing, cartooning, typing, 
copy-reading, headline - writ
ing, or any other aspect of 
journalism, is invited to work 
on the TARTAN. Meetings are 
held Friday, at 5:00 in the 
UNION; work is done on Fri
day nights and Sunday after
noons. Workers are needed 
desperately at these times. 
Promotions based on inches of 
copy and hours of work are 
made every six weeks; and 
keys are obtainable for two 
years active duty.
People are also needed to 
solicit ads and write or design 
ad copy. Students interested 
in advertising should contact 
the business manager. P & 
Ds will be especially welcome 
on ad layout; printing stu
dents can also be of great as
sistance with their profession
al knowledge. The TARTAN 
is under revision and needs 
interested workers.
This Friday night, February 15, Interhonorary Council will pre
sent its much anticipated Stardust Swing. Baron Elliott and his or
chestra will provide the music for informal dancing from nine to one
in the Gymnasium.
I. H. Council is sponsoring a 
Date Bureau, principally for vet
erans who are new to the cam
pus. Realizing the difficulties 
newcomers on campus might 
have in obtaining dates for this 
dance, Interhonorary has ap
pointed Lou Umbach and Imogene Grove to take charge of the 
Bureau. Fellows who wish dates 
should call Lou at SC 9962 and 
tell him their physical specifica
tions and their preference as to 
dates, and girls should call Imogene at SC 9138 and do the same.
Tickets for tnis all-school dance 
are only $1.80 a couple and may 
be purchased at the booth in 
Skibo any day or from a member 
of the Council.
Decorations, under the super
vision of Dave Nicol, will carry 
out the stardust theme of the 
dance. White stars on a blue 
background will be painted on a 
false ceiling over the dance floor.
Chaperons for the dance will 
be the sponsors of each honorary 
on campus. The committee in 
charge of arrangements are Jo 
Sunseri (Chairman), Sammy 
Martin, Augie Binder, and Bob 
Kerr.
Tech Cwens Hold 
Intercollege Tea
At the Union on Saturday af
ternoon, February 17, the Car
negie Tech Cwens, a national Hon
orary for sophomore women, will 
hold an informal tea from 3 to 5 
for the members of the Pitt and 
Tech chapters of Mortar Board 
and for the members of Hood 
and Tassel from P. C. W.
Among the guests will be Dean 
Jessie Y. Yon, Miss Ruth F. Tut
tle, Miss Louise G. Russell, Miss 
Helen Rush, Dean of Women at 
Pitt, the Misses Harriet Glasser 
and Elizabeth Teal, assistants to 
Miss Rush, and Miss Helen Marks, 
Dean of Women at P. C. W. Pat 
Baum, president of Cwens, will 
preside at the tea.
Notice
The juke-box dance sched
uled for February 16 will not 
be held, due to the redecora
tion of Thistle Hall. The next 
basketball dance will be in 
Thistle Hall on March 2.
Student Council Candidates 
Present Extensive Platforms
Paper Changes Often 
Since Its Start in 1906
The change in the format of 
the Carnegie Tartan, which was 
effected last week, is not the first 
metamorphosis to occur in the 
lifetime of the paper. Through 
the years, the style of its flag, or 
nameplate, has wavered between 
Roman and Old English, and for 
a time it consisted solely of a 
large and gruesome photograph 
of Industries Hall. It has had 
from three to seven columns, and 
its advertisements have varied 
from beauty parlor to religious 
ads. The paper once actually had 
a movie column. But when you 
discuss the Tartan in general, you 
must never forget October 
twenty-fourth.
Wednesday, October 24, 1906 is 
a momentous date, one that 
should be memorized by every 
freshman and wnlch should be 
engraved in gold or at least brass 
in the heart of every Techite. What happened on October 
twenty-fourth? Why the first 
Tartan came out of course.

On February 19 from 12:30 
to 3:30 P. M. the Student Coun
cil will hold a special election for 
the candidates competing for the 
Engineering Voting -Representa
tive. The office wili be a one sem
ester position and the candidates 
are Robert D. Teasdale and Louis 
Umbach, Jr.
Both of these men participated 
in many extra-curricular activi
ties. The activities Robert Teas
dale has participated in are as 
follows: Copy Editor of the Tar
tan, Advertising Manager of the 
Thistle, a contributor to the Tech
nical and the Scottie, a member 
of the Tau Beta Pi, Alpha Phi 
Omega, Tecvets, Mens Glee Club, 
Citcom, Cross-Country and Track 
before it was given up. He is also 
the Publicity Director of the AIEEIRE and a George Westinghouse 
Scholar.
Louis Umbach, the other can
didate, is a member of the Theta 
Xi, Tau Beta Pi, O. D. K., Inter
honorary Council, the A. I. E. E.,
I. R. E., Radio Club, Phi Kappa 
Phi, and is President of the Eta 
Kappa Nu.
The Platform of Robert Teas
dale is as follows:
In my time spent at Carnegie,
Lou Umbach
first as a 42 freshman, later as a 
membervof the Tech ASTP while 
in the Army, and now as a ci
vilian senior scheduled to gradu
ate in May, I have seen the school 
as it has been in its leanest days 
and as it has been in near-nor
mal times. My views are definite 
on what is and what is not to be 
desired on the campus.
In running for Student Coun
cil, I present this sincere sixpoint platform listed in order of 
importance:
1. To be certain in my own 
mind that the actions of Student 
Council are those which promise 
the greatest benefit to the greatest 
number.
2. To better acquaint everyone 
on campus with what goes on, 
particularly the commuters and 
dorm members.
3. To be open to and to act hon
estly . on suggestions from any 
group whatsoever.
4. To aid in solving the inevit
able campus reconversion prob
lems.
5. To revive social life on cam
pus to its 42 level with particuCarnivjig tl

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUAF x 12, 1946
Editors Armchair
I Didnt Want Any Friends Anyway
It has not been the policy of the editor of the Tartan to 
take a stand in favor of any one candidate in a campus elec
tion in recent years. We do not wish to violate this policy, but 
we feel that there is an issue at stake in this election which 
demands public clarification.
Within the past few months many of the traditions which 
made campus life more interesting and more fun before the 
war have been revived, but some of the evils of pre-war 
college life have also shown their ugly heads. In the good 
old days before the war, Interfraternity Council very thorougly controlled the Carnegie campus, politically speaking. 
Each year they would meet in secret session to select the 
candidates they wanted to run for Student Council. Their 
selections were practically always elected because no frat 
would consider running a candidate not thus chosen by IF, 
because no frat man would think of voting for any man not 
endorsed by the Council, and because the unorganized inde
pendent groups, by not running for office and by being too 
disinterested to vote for their candidates, permitted the Coun
cil to get away with murder. By choosing the men who sat on 
Student Council, IF was thus able to select indirectly the staffs 
of campus publications, the members of class honoraries, and 
through the control of the social and budget committees of 
Council, to govern the activities of every non-fraternity or
ganization on campus. During the war, the Council discon
tinued the practice of putting up a united front against the 
rest of the campus, because there were not enough frat men 
at CIT to guarantee the election of a ticket thus selected. Last 
spring, however, the custom was revived, and the IF candidate 
scheduled to take Irv Aisenbergs place at the present election 
was selected by the Council at least a month ago. We believe 
that this revival of the IF nomination practice is politically
(continued on page 4)
Where, Oh Where . . .
You all have noticed the sudden influx of vets on the 
Carnegie campus. The men among you are no doubt happy 
about it because some of them are joining the frats; the 
women are no doubt happy because, well . . . However, if 
we dont do something about it in a hurry, quite a few of 
them will be leaving us.
It seems that that bug-a-boo weve all been hearing about, 
the national housing shortage, has caught up with the Carnegie 
Campus. The freshmen enrolling this semester simply can 
find no place to stay in the smoky city. Rumor has it that 
one of the boys is considering commuting back and forth from 
California daily. Another has been telling everyone that he 
sleeps in Schenley park every night. Actually he has been 
shuttling back and forth between the YMCA downtown and 
a sofa in the home of a bighearted Squirrel Hill resident. One 
boy has spent the last three nights on a sofa in Carnegie Union.
The problem for the single men is not nearly so acute as 
that which the married veterans are facing. It is almost totally 
impossible for the married men to find rooms big enough for 
themselves and their wives, and those who have children 
havent got a chance. The Carnegie Administration is making 
plans for the accommodation of these men in the near future. 
They will soon open Mill Hall, one of the small dorms, for 
the single men, and they have applied for government hous
ing as well. Temporarily, however, the situation is acute.
You can do something about it Some of you must have a 
room or rooms in which the vets and their wives can stay for 
just a few weeks. You have an attic you can reconvert. They 
need it more than you do. It may be inconvenient for you, but 
its terrible for them! Get in touch with Miss Bird in the Deans 
office today and tell her that you can help the vets out with 
a room.

Most Important Tech Traditions 
Surround Rustic Senior Fence
Tech is not a tradition-bound 
campus. However, we have a few 
spots which are hallowed by tra
dition. The stone bench behind 
Fine Arts School, which was do
nated by the Class of 1927 to the 
Carnegie Tech campus, will ling
er ever in the memory of Army 
Specialized Training Corpsmen 
and their girls. The most import
ant tradition on the campus, how
ever, is that surrounding the rustic 
fence which stands at the head of 
the Cut. This fence is located on a 
small triangle of ground behind 
the tree planted by the Class of 
1927. (busy little bees, werent 
they?) Thus it serves no useful 
purpose other than to support suc
ceeding generation of Carnegie 
Tech seniors. It also supports sev
eral coats of paint which have 
been applied every year at Hal
loween. Even the brass plate 
which adorns the fence attribut
ing it to the Class of 1923 glows 
with the crimson of red lead paint.
In the past any Frosh, Sopho
mores, or Juniors caught sitting on 
the fence were drawn and quar
tered and their heads were hung 
on the branches of the tree which 
shades the fence so that prospec
tive offenders would be warned 
off. Lately, the fence has been 
desecrated by lowly underclass
men who have sat upon the sacred 
wood and received no chastise
ment. The incoming men should 
learn the tradition surrounding 
the fence so that they will not be 
classed with these social outcasts 
of recent semesters.
The Senior Fence is popular be
cause of its strategic position. Most 
girls who are going from Margaret 
Morrison to Engineering Hall and 
Industries Hall pass it, excluding 
those who must stop at Skifoo to 
replenish the energies depleted by 
the arduous classes in Industries. 
During the war, the Army Spec
ialized Training Corpsmen made 
ample use of the fence for 
wolfing purposes.
They and their predecessors
Word Received Of 
Two Former Techites
The Carnegie Tartan has re
ceived news from the War De
part concerning two former Tech 
students, Pvt. Pasquale A. Rubino and Pvt. Bernard B. Roth.
Pvt. Rubino, a former Civil 
Engineering student, hag been as
signed to the Far East Air Serv
ice Command as chief clerk in 
the finance section. This com
mand has its headquarters in Ma
nila.
Pvt. Roth is now stationed at 
the Army Air Forces (European 
Theater) Reinforcement Depot, 
which was moved from France 
to the heart of a Bavarian forest 
near Munich. The Depot was for
merly a Luftwaffe training school.
left evidence of their occupation 
behind them. Initials cover the 
fence marring its classic beauty. 
Traditional little hearts pierced 
by traditional cupid arrows plus 
other artistic embellishments are 
whittled in the wood. Techites 
may be wandering around the 
campus now whose parents sat on 
the fence and carved their initials 
there.
The senior fence is the favorite 
roosting spot of a species of un
dergraduate who answers both to 
whistles and to the name of Casey 
Stine. Incidentally Casey, I hope 
you noticed the punishment listed 
above for underclassmen who sit 
on the Senior Fence.
Letter to the Editor
Let me moan, please let me 
moan. It will do no more good, I 
realize, than attempting to pass an 
engineering course without the use 
of benzedrine or No-Doz pills, but 
it may cause me to feel unhappy 
about the whole thing.
The subject under consideration 
is the appalling reinstatement of 
both the 8:30 class and the Satur
day session. Such things by rights 
happen only to people in news
reels. I am not suggesting that, 
merely to keep up with the times, 
the students picket the hallowed 
halls bearing huge signs calling for 
More Units Per Hour or other 
comments apropos. For this is a 
problem concerning Carnegies 
Lost Battalion of Forgotten Men 
(and Coeds)the Tech Commut
ers.
In the more or less esoteric par
lance of C-725, my BI III/3 sees 
no CCA in its relationship with 
such an environment. I neither 
adjust to, am motivated by, seek 
information in, learn from, nor 
understand such a situation.
Upon arising early last night 
(6:30 A. M. is an unholy hour), I 
snitched three nuts from the fam
ily pecan roll at breakfast without 
even tasting one. Such frustrating 
events must cease.
But Saturday is the evil day. 
If I date a girl near school to see 
Carmen Jones, for instance, to 
do a real bang-up job, the whole 
day involves riding ten separate 
street cars. That it should happen!
All, however, is not lost. Ive 
just been voted Mr. Pittsburgh 
Railway of 1946 and awarded a 
small pillow which allows one free 
ride the fifth time I sleep past a 
stop on any given day.
Sincerely,
Robert D. Teasdale.
Notice
There will be a meeting of 
the Thistle workers on Fri
day, February 15, at 4:45 in 
their Carnegie Union meeting 
room.
Menti tf-toun cM&ie and ltete
Recently, there has been much 
talk about providing emergency 
housing for the veterans who are 
crowding the nations colleges. 
One school, Purdue, in West 
Lafayette, Indiana, has decided to 
do something about it. A five 
million dollar appropriation was 
approved by the University 
trustees on the 25 th of January 
for a program of housing construc
tion to be begun immediately. Two 
hundred houses of the temporary 
type to be available by September 
1st will be set up for married 
veterans and staff members, bring
ing the total number of these units 
to four hundred. They will be 
made of fiber board panels with 
some aluminum siding. In addi
tion, Tee-shaped workers dormi
tories will be moved in from de
fense plant towns in Illinois to 
provide space for 804 single vet
erans. This will be accomplished 
as soon as constructino material 
and labor conditions permit. A res
idence hall for 600 men and three 
dormitories housing a total of 1100 
women are in the planning stage. 
The total cost of the residence hall 
groups will be $3,750,000, all to be 
ready by 1947. Each project will 
be self supporting and self-liqui
dating. This example is a good 
one and it is to be hoped that other 
universities will follow suit in or
der to give the veteran the educa
tion which the G.I. Bill guaran
tees him.
One of Americas proudest 
achievements during this war has 
been the construction of vast num
bers of comparatively large mer
chant ships in addition to a huge 
and versatile navy. Modern ship
building methods have reduced 
the time required to turn out a 
Liberty ship to a few days, an4 
giant construction yards permit 
this to be duplicated continuously. 
However, about 2348 B. C., some
one else did quite a job of ship
building. It wasnt on a mass pro
duction basisjust one ship for 
an emergency  but considering 
the lack of anything but the most 
primitive tools and Henry Kaiser,
it wasnt a bad bit of work. The 
Ingalls News reveals that it was 
about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, 
and 45 feet high. It had accom
modations for its six hundred year 
old master and his hundred year 
old infant triplets as well as the 
rest of his large family, plus 150 
birds on the first deck, food stor
age bins on the second, and pens 
for 112 clean and 150 unclean ani
mals on the third deck. About six 
score reptiles, which were in ill 
repute at the time, were cooped up 
in a small corner wellout of the 
way of the rest. This ship com
pares favorably with the modem 
C-3 ship with its 489 foot length, 
70 foot beam, and 45 foot depth. 
In addition, it was sufficiently seaworthy to withstand storms, 
worthy of the recent North Atlan
tic gales. In fact, the emergency 
for which it was built put our re
cent conflict to shame, destroying 
every living thing on earth out
side of this craft. In case you 
havent guessed it yet, its skipper 
was a man by the name of Noah.
Tradition At Tech: 
The Ships Prow
Many of the freshmen have 
heard the upperclassmen speak 
of the Ships Prow. Many of them 
are wondering what it is.
The Ships Prow behind Ma
chinery Hall stands as one of the 
oldest traditional sites on the 
Tech Campus. It is a concrete bow 
of a ship decorated with the 
bronze figure-head of the armored 
cruiser U .S. S. Pittsburgh. The 
figure-head was donated to 
school in 1922 after being disj*, 
mantled in 1912 by the United 
States Government. The school 
ofjen questions the word donated 
since the freight charges from the 
Puget Sound Navy Yard amount
ed to some $282. The many 
C. I. T. students who dont realize 
that this exists should drop down 
to see the Ships Prow and get ac
quainted with one of the land
marks around campus.

Swaney Visits NYC 
Via Waldorf-Astoria
There are several additions and 
corrections to the story, printed 
in last weeks Tartan, concerning 
Shirley Swaneys trip to New 
York, which was awarded for 
selling the most War Bonds at 
Tech.
Shirley left last Wednesday 
night and arrived in New York 
Thursday morning. After lunch 
at Wanamakers, she spent the 
afternoon at an exhibit of pre
fabricated homes called Village 
of Vision. In the evening she 
had dinner at the Waldorf As
toria, where she stayed overnight. 
Other women, to whom Wana
makers awarded this war bond 
trip, were mostly chairmen of 
War Bond Committees from seven 
counties in Eastern Pennsylvania.

The traditional Beaux Arts Ball, 
to be held April 5 on the first 
floor of the Fine Arts building, 
will be sponsored by the newly 
reorganized Beaux Arts Honorary 
Society. Tom Lakowski and Scot
ty Yurchison are in charge, with 
entertainment directed by Casey 
Stine.
The Beaux Arts Ball has tradi
tionally been attended by Fine 
Arts students only. First held in 
1923, the ball occurred annually 
until 1940.
In the past the Beaux Arts Ball 
was one of the biggest spectacles 
on campus, complete with lavish 
decorations and entertainment. 
According to plans, th whole first 
floor will be decorated and devoted 
to the ball.
An assembly was held today for 
Fine Arts students to decide 
whether the dance will be stag or 
date, and whether it will be all
school or limited.
The Beaux Arts Society which 
is sponsoring the ball, is an hon
orary for Fine Arts students. Un
der the faculty supervision of Pro
fessors Readio and Schmertz, 
members are chosen on the basis 
of scholarship, activities, and char
acter. Its duties include the pro
motion of activities among Fine 
Arts students and sponsoring the 
Beaux Arts Ball.
The members of the society in
clude Tom Lakowski, President; 
Casey Stine, Vice-President; Esther 
Haushalter, Secretary; Scotty 
Yurchison, Treasurer; and Gus 
Kermes, Marty Moore, Caroline 
Cook, Burt Pollock, Pat Werner, 
and Danny Franks. Elections will 
be held to select new members.
Michigan Group Will 
Hear Prof. Siegfried
On February 18 Professor Laurance B. Siegfried, head of the 
Printing Department, will address 
members of the Graphic Arts As
sociation of Michigan on College 
Training for Printers. The meet
ing will be held at the Whittier 
Hotel in Detroit. The members of 
the association include employers 
and employees of all the wellknown printing houses of Detroit 
and vicinity. Professor Siegfried 
made a similar trip last month to 
Baltimore where he addressed a 
large group of professional print
ers and students.
Notice
Tecvets will hold a special 
meeting on Wednesday, February 
13, at 4:30 P. M. in room 104 I. H. 
The meeting is being called to set
tle up accounts on the dance held 
lasrt week.
Also on Friday, February 15, at 
4:30 there will be a meeting of all 
married vets in room 104 I. H. 
The topic of the meeting will be 
A General Discussion of Housing 
Conditions.
Tartan Presents 
Changed Aspect
Tech Students were probably 
surprised at the drastic changes 
in the Tartan last week, but these 
changes came as no shock to the 
staff which has been working on 
them for nearly a year. As early as 
last spring, Gus Kermes, a senior 
P&D, started to design a name 
plate for the paper. Special credit 
goes to him for redesigning it 
again and again until he produced 
what the staff wanted.
The official beginning of these 
changes occurred at the Publica
tions Banquet last fall when Pro
fessor Seigfried inspired the staff 
to action. Since then, each issue 
with its minor improvements has 
been an attempt to make the 
Tartan what it is today.
The staff is hopeful that the 
student body will approve of the 
revised Tartan and asks that any 
suggestions for further improve
ments be sent to the paper through 
inter-school mail.
Mortar Board 
Sponsors Dance
Mortar Board will sponsor a 
King of Hearts Dance in the 
Mens Gym on Saturday, Febru
ary 23, from 9 to 1. Brad Hunt 
and his orchestra will provide the 
music for the semi-formal af
fair, and the no flowers rule 
will be enforced.
The independents and each fra
ternity are to put a man up as 
candidate for the title of King 
of Hearts. The King will be 
chosen not by divine right, but 
by popular acclaim. Elections will 
be held at the dance and each 
couple will have two votes. This 
is done so that even though the 
femme may vote for the C.T. (Im 
from Kentucky) Butler type," her 
date can vote for the A1 (the 
baseball man) Checco type! Mor
tar Board members will count the 
votes and crown the King and his 
court at the dance.
Girls, heres your chance to 
bring your own King of Hearts, 
for this is a girl-ask-boy or a boyask-girl affair. Tickets may be 
obtained from any member of 
Mortar Board.
Sr. Honorary Elects 
Officers for Year
Omicron Delta Kappa, mens 
senior activities honorary, held 
elections last Tuesday to fill the 
offices left vacant by Bob Noyes 
and Andy Pepper at the end of last 
semester. Augie Binder was 
elected President and Lou Umbach, Vice President. Mr. Umbach 
will serve as representative to Interhonorary Council and Mr. 
Rollin V. Davis will continue as 
Secretary-Treasurer of the organ
ization. ODK will have charge of 
the annual Spring Carnival, with 
Joe Nutter acting as chairman of 
the Spring Carnival Committee.
Notice
The Thistle staff requests 
that the secretary of each or
ganization on campus  in
cluding honoraries and social 
fraternities and sororities 
send a list of their officers to 
the THISTLE by way of In
terSchool Mail this week!
The All-Veterans Dance given 
by the Tecvets at the Schenley 
Hotel on Friday, February 8, 
turned out to be one of the most 
successful social events of the 
year.
It was attended by approxi
mately 250 couples, including quite 
a few of the faculty and their 
wives. The Tecvets were pleas
urably surprised by the attendance 
of President and Mrs. Doherty. 
This was their first appearance at 
a campus function this year. Also 
present were Major and Mrs. 
Stanton, Dean Yon, Col. Dowling, 
Dr. and Mrs. Gregg, Dr. and Mrs. 
Warden, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Gustafson.
Bill LeRoys orchestra, led by 
Harold Haller while Bill LeRoy is 
serving in the Army, supplied the 
music, both hot and sweet.
The ballroom was arranged in 
cabaret style, with soft drinks 
served at the tables. Many un
derpaid veterans complained about 
being charged sixty cents a bottle 
for soft drinks. So, after the first 
round, most Tecvets sought re
freshment downstairs in the Hunt 
Room.

Registrants Show 
Large Increase
With the adding machine rust

used by Soc Rel profs, the Har
vard calculator was uncovered 
long enough to run off the latest 
figures on enrollment this semes

An enumeration of all sizes and 
shapes of noses reveals that there 
are just twenty-five short of two 
thousand roaming the campus by 
daylight. Engineers and scientists 
account for over half of all stu
dents with the numerical figure 
about 995. The College of Fine 
Arts gathered in 121 new P&Ds, 
dramats, etc., to boast its total to 
522. The addition of 23 new girls 
increased the Maggie Murph fig
ure to 439. The Library School has 
the rest.
A breakdown of the whole 
school by classes shows 126 grad
uates of one sort or another, 227 
students just short of a degree, 
311 in the junior class, 513 soph
omores, 740 freshman, and 46 
special students. The senior class 
is equally divided with 77 in En

the most dangerous thing that has 
happened on campus in the past 
five years.
We do not wish to discuss here 
the pros and cons of the fraternity 
system. We believe that this is an 
issue entirely divorced from the 
question of the value of the fra
ternity as an institution. We do 
not feel that men should necessar
ily be forbidden to form themsel
ves into select groups on a college 
campus, but we believe that a 
situation in which every frat 
man on campus is required to vote 
as he is directed by his 
fraternity president, a situation in 
which two or three candidates are 
backed by a political machine for 
the benefit of only that machine 
and not of the whole campus, a 
situation in which candidates are 
elected not because of their abil
ity but because of inter fraternity 
rivalry and their value to the ad
vancement of fraternity power on 
campus, definitely should be 
remedied.
When the engineers go to the 
polls next Tuesday, the election 
of a single member of student 
council will not be the issue on 
which they will vote. They will be 
voting for or against the control 
by Interfratemity Council of every 
phase of campus life. A choice be
tween the candidates will be an 
easy one, for both men running for 
couneil are intelligent, capable, 
and both have played a large part 
in activities. The engineers must 
decide when they vote only 
whether they want the man who 
personifies the future control by 
If of publications, of honoraries, 
of Student Council, of dances, and 
of every other phase of campus 
life, the man who will act in 
Council for the benefit of IF, or 
whether they want an unaffiliated 
man who will act and vote on 
Council for the benefit of the 
whole school.

Last week men were elected 
to both Scimitar and Delta 
Skull. In making selections, 
members of the Mens Point 
Committee spent a great deal of 
time and effort. Furthermore, I 
realize that to criticize is far 
easier than to originate, to tear 
down much simpler than to con
struct. Realizing these facts, I 
shall still venture to point out 
several discrepancies and in
equalities which have neverthe
less occurred. It goes without 
saying that I am in favor of hon
oraries and fully in accord with 
their -reinstatement. However. I 
am equally concerned that these 
things be done properly.
First of all, factor require
ments were not met in all cases. 
Both honoraries have one man 
below the required 1.75, one 
member of the Scimitars being 
below .6.
Next, points were disregarded 
in selections for two reasons: to 
avoid the excessive difficulty of 
tabulation, particularly for re
turning veterans, and to get a 
better cross section of the eligi
ble students. The second reason 
is not valid, particularly in the 
case of the Scimitars, where 
eleven of sixteen members hail 
from only two fraternities. Also 
in both organizations, the per
centage of independents was a 
trifle low, though not markedly 
so.
There are also those on cam
pus who claim they can prove 
that one of the new Scimitars 
has been noticed cheating on at 
least two separate examinations, 
one a final.
The Scimitar president was not 
elected according to the constitu
tion, nor were his activities con
sidered in nominations accepted 
from the floor. One outstanding 
Scimitar needed a special petition 
to have his name added to the 
list of those eligible. Also one 
Delta Skull needed some special 
proceedings, but his original ex
clusion was not the fault of the 
honorary.
Furthermore, to name names, I 
should merely like to question the 
exclusion of Danny Franks and

Secret Revealed; 
Students at Tech 
Live Over Tunnels
Do you have the spirit of a 
Byrd, a Columbus, or a Hudson? 
Have you that adventuresome, ex
ploratory curiosity that is titillat
ed by underground passages and 
secret rooms? Ah, then Tech with 
her steam tunnels is the place 
for you.
Th steam tunnels are a must 
on any list of places to be seen. 
They originate in a central plant 
deep beneath Machinery Hall 
which supplies the school with 
hot water and steam heat. These 
tunnels, unknown to the average 
Tech student, house the essential 
pipes and wires necessary for the 
continued and uninterrupted ex
istence of life at Tech, including 
the telephone and wiring circuits, 
heat lines, steam lines, return 
lines, gas lines, and compressed 
air lines. There is estimated to be 
thirty-six inches of expansion on 
the heat lines from the engine 
room to the gym-about 1440 
feet, the entire length of the tun
nel. There are branches from this 
main tunnel to every building on 
the campus. The first cutoff goes 
to Engineering Hall, the second 
to the Fine Arts Building, the 
third to Margaret Morrison, and 
the fourth to the gymnasium 
building. Before 1922 (the year 
in which the tunnels were built, 
these same pipes and wires were 
laid in a ditch. The tunnels were 
completed because the ditch was 
unsatisfactory as a means of hous
ing them. Besides providing heat 
and hot water for all the school 
buildings, the tunnels provide a 
means by which these lines can 
reach the dorms.
Student Council Has

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Wild Antics Prevail As Gals, 
Faculty Invade; Skibos Lose
Those who ambled over to the 
Tech gym last Saturday night wit* 
nessed two of the queerer exam
ples of what can be done with a 
basketball. After the Tech Skirts, 
J.Vs and faculty had put on a 
combination basketball game and 
vaudeville act, the Geneva College 
quintet took the measure of the 
Tech Five, in an equally-wild af
fair, 48-42.
Faculty Routes Jay Vees?
The prelim, one of Bill (where 
do I get this stuff) Sherbs brain
storms, saw the J.V.s pitted 
against the Tech Skirts and The 
Faculty. The skirts, appearing in 
size 65 mens shirts and shorts 
took advantage of'a couple of foul 
shots scored by the ref to win 6-4. 
The Faculty, backed by a gang of 
loyal Muhlenbruch rooters, capi
talized on five consecutive free 
throws awarded them by ref Max 
Hannum, to nose out the opposi
tion. At the end of the stanza, the 
scoreboard showed Faculty 98, 
J. V. 6.
Melee Continues
The main bout took up where 
the prelim had left off. Tech, 
through the scoring efforts of 
Levy, Kuzma and Watson, built 
up a 9-5 lead, only to throw it 
away, literally. The boys had the 
seasons worst case of the jitters 
and continually threw the ball to 
the Coventeers, who had no choice 
but to drop it through the hoop. 
The Tartans, to make things worse, 
had trouble with their zone de
fense and, before the situation 
could be remedied, McComb, the 
visitors center had sunk three 
short pops and Geneva was out in 
front, 14-11 at the quarter.
Podbielski Rides Again
About this time, Dave Podbiel
ski, ace Geneva point-getter to 
date, got red hot and poured 
through six quick points. Elmer 
Lipp swished a pivot shot and 
Podbielski tapped in a rebound 
and Geneva rolled merrily on its 
way to a rout. The best Tech 
could do during this hurricane was
for the purpose of avoiding any 
misunderstandings. All teams 
will bowl every Saturday for five 
weeks with the initial competi
tion getting underway this Satur
day.
a foul shot by Watson. The score
board showed Geneva 24-12 when 
Tech finally got wise and called a 
time out. Lew Heiles entered the 
fray here and injected some more 
oomph into the faltering Tartans. 
With Heiles and Meyer grabbing 
a good percentage of the rebounds 
from the taller visitors, and scor
ing 5 points between them, Tech 
narrowed the margin to 26-19 at 
the half.
Both teams were alternately hot 
and cold in the third period. The 
Tartans got off to a good start 
as jittery Joe Harmuth swished 
two rebounds. However, Pod
bielski and McComb went to work 
again and got back the lost points 
and gave Geneva a 35-26 advan
tage as the stanza ended.
Chetlin Scores 8, But
All of which set the stage for 
the Wild Fourth. The ball went 
back and forth as fast as in a 
ping-pong game with both teams 
throwing caution to the winds. 
Lipp and Podbielski tallied for 
Geneva while little Marty Chet
lin kept Tech in the game by 
dropping two long set shots. The 
affair stood at 41-36 when a sad 
fact made itself evidentTech 
didnt have any height on the floor. 
Geneva took complete control of 
the backboards and tapped in two 
rebounds. That did it, Marie. 
Tech made a game try to close the 
gap as Chetlin tossed in 4 more 
points, but Geneva was not to be 
denied and wound up on top, 48- 
42.
Sidelights on the Game: Elmer 
Lipp, the Geneva pivot man, turn

Lew Heiles* entrance into the

Pitt copped their second victory 
over Tech this season by a score 
of 57-45, compared to an earlier 
season victory of 56-45. As was 
predicted by this reporter last 
week, Tech showed possibilities of 
upsetting Pitt at various stages of 
the game; however the fleety five 
from Pitt always managed to keep 
pace with all of Techs outbursts 
with a terrific exhibition of shoot
ing. As in the last game the ab
sence of Gene Hannum was sorely 
felt, for in his last go against Pitt 
Gene poured through eighteen 
points which is turkey in any 
mans game.
Apple Leads For Pitt
The game in general had its ex
citing moments and was auspi
ciously started with Meyers cross
body block of a Pitt man. The 
scoring was started by speedy Ap
ple of Pitt after one minute of 
play, with two consecutive field 
goals. Tech didnt get into the 
scoring column until P. C. Kuzma 
tapped in a rebound to make the 
score 6-2. After that it was mere
ly an exchange of points with 
Tech drawing to within 3 points 
of the lead when Kuzma dropped 
in 2 quick baskets to make the 
score 14-11. Apple continued to 
be hot as a pistol in the first 
period by pouring through 9 points 
for Pitt. The second period start
ed out on even terms; however, 
Pitt hit their stride and piled up a 
16 point lead before the Tartan 
five broke the ice with 6 points by 
Meyers, Kuzma, and Jittery Joe 
Harmuth. The Pitt streak was 
marked by some terrific shooting 
by Medich, Apple and Maruzewski plus some excellent team work. 
At intermission time it looked as 
if the rest of the game might be a 
rout for the score was 37-22, plus 
the fact that Zellers, ace center of 
Pitt, had played but a fraction of 
the time. However, the third 
period proved to be a different 
story for Tech had the upperhand 
throughout.
Kuzma Outplays Zellers
The scoring during this period 
was highlighted by a beautiful 
pivot shot by C. T. Butler and a 
hook shot by ever dependable 
Harmuth. It was at this point that
Coach Carlson of Pitt realized the 
dangerous situation and put Zeller 
back in the lineup. However, as 
was experienced in the last game 
Big Paul Kuzma proved to be the 
better man in the situation by 
steadily outplaying Zeller.Levy Shows Old Form for Tech
With the start of the last period, 
Howie Levy, aggressive and sharp 
shooting guard, shook off the 
gremlins which had been plaguing 
him throughout the game and 
started popping them in from all 
over. This plus the freezing tac
tics of Pitt kept the crowd of 1500 
on the edge of their seats down to 
the last minute of the game; how
ever, Pitt proved their superiority 
and were still well ahead as the 
game ended. Maruzewski proved 
to be the nemesis of the Tartan 
terrors as he salted away 19 
points on 6 fieldgoals and 7 foul 
shots. However, he was ably as
sisted by Apple and Medich who 
had 13 and 10 points respectively. 
High man for Tech again, was 
Kuzma with 14 points, closely 
followed by Levy with 12 points. 
A disappointing factor of the 
game was the inability of Tech to 
set up any system against Pitts 
rarely used zone defense, and 
time and time again again Pitt 
stole the ball and scored on her 
very fast break. However, credit 
should be given to the fact that 
Tech finally has come to life in 
reference to making their foul 
shots as compared to previous poor 
performances and potted 19 foul 
shots as to Pitts 13. Three beers 
to Kuzma for his outstanding play 
throughout the game, for he really 
had Zellers sweating at times, 
which truly is a rare sight.
Two beers to the rest of the team 
for their fight, and for not giving 
in to a more experienced five.
Question of the day: What has
happened to Lew Heile, regular 
guard of last semester?

By Dick Heckman
With all due apologies to all 
the guys who thought they had 
gotten rid of me (How are ya, 
Casey?), this Saddest Sack has 
returned. Yes, our dear Uncle 
came within five seconds of mak
ing a bad deal, but the Army 
adopted the stand of It shouldt 
happen to a dog when they look
ed a little closer, so here we are 
back at the old station again. 
Saw last weeks Tartan. Many 
thanks to Don Clendenen for the 
back-slapping, but dont believe 
a word of it.
The preliminaries to the var
sity basketball games this past 
week stole the show from the 
main attractions. Before the Pitt 
game last Wednesday, the Dorms 
collected an aggregation of solid 
citizens the like of which wont 
be seen again for some time. When 
we say solid, we mean solid. The 
team had an average age of 24 
and an average weight of about 
200 pounds. Needless to say, 
things got a little rough. High
light of the affair was the appear
ance of Mike Evans on the court 
with a stogie in his mouth.
The Geneva prelim was even 
more fantastic. For those who are 
wondering who that pretty red
head was, George Maley can tell 
you. It seems George had a little 
trouble in the second half when 
a shoulder-strap broke. Between 
quarters, the Tech Skirts (or, bet
ter, Shirts) took time to powder 
their collective noses, while the 
referees patched-up their wounds. 
The faculty affair was teed off 
with the raising of a tremendous 
banner, on which was humbly in
scribed Our hero, Muhlenbruch. 
The biggest laugh of the evening, 
however, was completely spon
taneous. Stan Kohn was called 
from the crowd to play in the 
game. Stan steps on to the floor, 
looking sharp as a dart in his 
new brown suit, takes off his coat, 
and everybody laughs. Why? The 
nice white shirt he has on has 
a big Cleveland Heights written 
on the back. Bowlings a great 
sport!
Between halves of the Geneva 
game, Max Hannum was present
ed with a watch by the ball team 
in appreciation for the great job 
he has turned in as Tech mentor. 
There wasnt much response from 
the crowd for a moment, but then 
something happened which is very 
rare. The onlookers gradually be
gan to notice what was happen
ing, and as Max walked off the 
floor, the crowd rose in a body 
and gave him one of the most 
tremendous ovations seen any
where, anytime. Dont tell me 
Carnegie Tech doesnt appreciate 
a great guy!

INTRAMURAL 
ROUND-UP
It has been an off week for in
tramurals, but with bowling 
scheduled to start Saturday and 
basketball two days later there 
will be a lot more activity than 
Tech campus has seen for many 
a season.
There are thirteen teams set to 
take to the gym floor in search of 
the cagesters crown and twelve 
groups of five competing on the 
maple lanes of the Craig St. 
alleys. The large number of en
tries have made it necessary to 
divide the teams into two leagues 
with play-offs deciding the cham
pionships. The basketball play
off is scheduled for March 19 and 
the bowling for March 30.
The competing cagesters in
clude eight fraternitiesPhi Kap
pa, Delta Upsilon, Tau Delta Phi, 
Theta Xi, Delta Tau Delta, Pi 
Kappa, Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon, and Beta Theta Pi; two dorm 
teamsScobell Hall and a WelchHenderson combine; and three 
independent quintets going by the 
handles of P.B.A., T.N.T., and 
7-B. The pin-splitters also in
clude eight fraternitiesTau Del
ta Phi, Delta Upsilon, Sigma Al

pa Alpha, Beta Sigma Rho, Delta 
Tau Delta, and Theta Xi; two 
dorm teams  Scobell Hall and 
Welch Hall, and two independent 
teamsthe Citcom Clan and the 
Zetas.
The basketball rules are simple 
enough: (1) Failure to appear
with five men in uniform within 
five minutes of scheduled game 
time will constitute a forfeiture.
(2) There will 'be four eight-min
ute quarters. Two minutes be
tween quarters and ten minutes 
between halves. (3) All protests 
must be made in writing to the 
Intramural Board within 24 hours 
after the contest has been played. 
(4) All players must be named 
on eligibility lists and have been 
examined and approved by Dr. 
Rike. (5) Each team will furnish 
a scorer and a timer who will be 
responsible to the referee of thr 
game. The games will be played 
at seven and eight Monday, Tues
day, Wednesday, and Thursday.
The bowling regulations are 
hot quite as simple. Special sheets 
have been issued to the intra
dural representatives of the teams

Tech Rehires Vet As 
Mechanical Technician
Carnegie Tech has secured the 
services of a veteran who left a 
job here in January, 1943, to an
swer Uncle Sams call. He is 
Victor T. Lechowicz, whose of
ficial title down at Machinery 
Hall, where he will be found dur
ing working hours, is Assistant 
Mechanical Technician.
Red, as he is called because 
of his unmistakeably colored hair, 
came to work for C. I. T. in Sep
tember, 1942, and was here only 
a few months when the Army 
called. A native Pittsburgher, he 
graduated from Oliver High 
School and attended Alliance Col
lege and Conneley Technical.
His army career with the avia
tion engineers took him to the 
South Pacific, where he served on 
New Guinea, Dutch East Indies, 
the Philippines, and Japan. He 
was discharged December 19, 1945, 
and returned to work for Tech on 
January 15, 1946. He says, Im 
glad Im out of the army, and Im 
glad Im back at Tech.

Dr. Estermann 
Addresses IRC
Dr. Immanuel Estermann, a 
member of the Physics Depart
ment and an authority on atomic 
physics, was the speaker at last 
Wednesdays International Rela
tions Club meeting. The topic of 
discussion was The Social As
pects of the Atomic Bomb, and 
Dr. Estermann enlarged on this 
topic, bringing out three main 
points: That the bomb should 
either be possessed by everyone 
or by no one, that if the United 
States withholds the secret of the 
bomb, a suspicious world will de
stroy us to obtain it, that the in
evitable conclusion of the Atomic 
Age is either the annihilation of 
mankind or the establishment of 
permanent peace.
The large number of veterans 
who turned out for this first meet
ing of the new semester added 
quite a bit to the discussion of 
the topic.
At the meeting next Wednes
day at 4:00, Mrs. Stuart W. Chap
man will lead a discussion of 
Russias wants in regard to for
eign policy.

Professor Gilmer Gets 
Army Commendation
Dr. Beverly Gilmer, member of 
the psychology department and 
former Major in the Army Air 
Forces Training Command has 
been awarded the Army Com

During his military leave from 
August 1943 to January 1946, Dr. 
Gilmer acted as Assistant to the 
Surgeon in Test Operation and 
Field Research Units of the Psy
chological Section of AAF. In 
this capacity he contributed to the 
standardization of psychological 
tests for the selection of aircrew 
personnel. He was commended 
for his notable service to the 
Command and war effort in this 
capacity.
Dr. Gilmer was released from 
the Army last December, and re
turned to Carnegie at the begin
ning of this semester.

life.
Radio Contest 
Open To Students
The Mutual Broadcasting Sys
tem is starting a search for new 
radio script writers, the best of 
whom will have their efforts pre
sented on the air beginning 
Thursday, February 21 (8 to 8:30 
p. m.). The contest will last for 
thirteen weeks, each winner to 
receive a basic prize of $200 plus 
full credit for his achievement, in 
addition to being eligible for the 
grand prize of $500 and a hand
some plaque for the best of the 
series. There are few limitations 
upon the nature of the script 
comedy, romance, mystery, and 
most of the other forms of drama 
will have a place in the pro
grams. No previous experience is 
necessary to enter this contest. 
Anyone with a good story to tell 
and enough knowledge of radio 
technique to tell it is welcome to 
submit materials for possible use 
in the Carrington Playhouse.
This experimental series of 
programs gets its name from its 
producer, Mrs. Elaine Carrington, 
famed radio script writer, author, 
and playwright. She has a long 
history in the writing field. A 
well known writer for national 
magazines before she entered ra
dio, her articles appeared in the
President: Thomas Pratt.
Vice President: Fletcher Osterle. 
Secretary: Walter Blissel. 
Treasurer: Andrew H. Kuhl.
At 8:00 the same evening a ban
quet was held with Mr. Leroy Ol
sen serving as Master of Cere
monies. The guest speaker was 
Professor Blaisdell, who returned 
to Tech recently after collaborat
ing with Professor Trinks, former 
head of the Mechanical Engineer
ing Department, on a production 
schedule for the Shell Manufac
turing Company.
The first meeting of the spring 
semester was held at 11:30 A. M. 
today in room 119 Machinery 
Hall. This was an organization 
meeting with the purpose of set
ting up the program for the rest 
of the year.

Born on May 4, 1881 in Steelton, 
Pennsylvania, Dr. Work lived'there 
only a short time until he moved 
to Springfield, Ohio. Here he 
seems to have bided time, growing 
up as an average American boy, 
until he entered Wittenburg Collge, located in his then home town 
of Springfield. He graduated in 
1902 with a degree of A B. Decid
ing to continue his education, Dr. 
Work attended Ohio State Univer
sity, where he took Electrical En
gineering. He added to his name 
M. E. in E. E. in 1905 when he 
graduated from Ohio State. The 
title of Doctor was added in 
1920 when he was awarded an 
honorary Doctor of Science de
gree from Wittenburg College.
With a fresh Electrical Engi
neering degree in his pocket in 
1905, Dr. Work embarked on his 
career as an Engineering Appentrice with Westinghouse Electric 
and Manufacturing Co. He stayed 
there only a short time, however, 
for in October, 1905 when Car
negie Institute of Technology, then 
known as the Carnegie Technical 
Schools, opened, he became af
filiated as a part-time teacher of 
Mathematics in the Evening 
School. The following June, 1906, 
Dr. Work became a full member 
of the staff of the Department of 
Electrical Engineering. He has 
been with C. I. T. ever since, exA personal checking account affords

---------------------------------------------------

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
FRAT FLASHES
Although the game Saturday 
was not exactly a smashing vic
tory for Tech, it was forgotten in 
the course of the frat parties..
A rush party at the Beta house 
for Which Schucker, Rose, Rid
dell, Martino were home making 
the party almost like an old time 
affair.
Fourteen new men now wear 
the golden square of Delta Tau 
Delta following the initiation 
Thursday afternoon. Following 
the initiation, a banquet was giv
en at the Royal York in honor of 
the new initiates. The new Delts 
are Ernie Balfrey, Ed Boland, 
Fran Clark, Bill Fields, Fred 
Frank, Fred Haller, Abe Hopper, 
Bob Hutchison, Jay Maratta, Jim 
McNutt, Jim Morgan, Don Stokes, 
Ed Thompson, and Scotty Yurchison. It seems that following the 
initiation, some Delts went out 
to the Du Drop Inn for a little 
celebration. The Delt barbershop 
quartet is now booked for several 
weeks there.
A rush party by the D.U.s Sat
urday at which dancing and 
chuga-luging of coke was fea
tured.
The Ho-bo party at T. X. house. 
People came as bums and hobos. 
The prize kick of the evening was 
when guests climbed up the fire 
escape, going through the third 
floor bath room to find one of the 
men taking a bath.
A benefit bridge luncheon was 
held in the Ballroom of the Schenley Hotel Saturday afternoon by 
the Pittsburgh Alliance of Tri 
Delts. In the way of entertain
ment a fashion show was present
ed by Hornes Dept. Store and a
Tartan History
[continued from page 1]
It was a scrawny little eightpage three-column ariair with the 
front page devoted entirely to 
sports. It is regrettable that even 
then Tech seemed to lose its ball 
games. California Normal vs. Car
negie Tech had been the first game 
of the season and as some one 
else once said, on an entirely dif
ferent occasion, Tech beat a 
strategic retreat. In fact, to put 
it bluntly, they lost. At least, I 
think they lost. The story which 
runs one column didnt give the 
score and since I have never un
derstood football, the outcome of 
the game is rather in doubt. It 
may be of some interest, that the 
first and only picture in that me
morial issue was of some football 
players all lined up.
To get to the inside of the is
sue, on the second and third 
pages, the new Freshman class 
was discussed. Called plebes by 
the upperclassmen, they appar
ently were slightly stronger than 
their Roman namesakes, because 
when they, as a class, fought the 
Juniors as a class, it was only by 
the grace of God that the Juniors 
won.
Another queer thing which 
strikes one as he reads the pa
per is that Pittsburgh was spelled 
Pittsburg. It must have been 
quite a burg, too, or else Techs 
founding fathers werent so strict, 
because a Mr. Harry DeHaan has 
an advertisement in offering to 
sell whiskey either retail or 
wholesale.
Page 4 breaks the startling 
news that the school was origin
ally galled the Carnegie Technical 
School, that a single copy of th# 
paper was (five cents, and that a 
year subscription could be ob
tained for the momentous sum 
of a dollar. The page also contains 
an stfldress by Director Hammerschl^g; it was called School Spirit 
and mourned tic fact'that 6aid 
spirit was *adly lacking in those 
days. The editors comment, the 
nrst editorial really, promised not 
only to review past event but al
so, even sometimes, to tell of some
the immediate future. The ediar also hoped to draw upon the 
for occasional essays

raffle was held for a silver pin 
and earring set designed by one of 
the women present. The affair 
was quite successful; attendance 
was not limited to members of the 
sorority. Ninety tables were oc
cupied by people playing bridge.
A national chapter visitor was 
present at a formal meeting of 
Sigma Kappa held Wednesday 
evening at the home of Mrs. W. 
Readio.
The big event of the week at the 
PiKA house came off Friday even
ing when Ed Clark pinned Mary 
Anne Schue. A house party was 
held after the game Saturday 
night. During the evening Mary 
Anne was serenaded at McGill 
Hall.

A Labor-Management Forum

most problems.
saying will be of interest to all 
men.
Page 5 was mostly advertise
ments. Page 6, on the other hand, 
contained a schedule of classes. 
There were six possible majors, 
which were electrical, mechanic
al, chemical, architecture, struc
tural and hydraulic civil, and 
railroad civil engineering. I dont 
think many engineers today 
would like to have the schedule 
given them then because every
one had classes from nine till 
four-thirty every day, with only 
an hour for lunch. (I guess they 
didnt play bridge.) Also, it may 
be of interest to the engineers of 
today that they were allowed no 
electives at all (Mng. Eds bitter 
lamentToo damn much tradi
tion around this joint).
Page 7 tells of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School for 
Women. A Miss Herron was one 
of the members on the committee 
that was to draw up a school con
stitution (I didnt know you were 
that old, Clara).
Page 8 contained club news 
and also an article about the novel 
and apparently new ideas of hav
ing social fraternities. A frater
nity was defined and then the 
question was asked Should a 
fraternity mix in campus poli
tics? There was also a proclama
tion by the Juniors concerning 
Frosh regulations. Rule one stated 
that plebes were not allowed to 
smoke; Rule two said that they 
couldnt loiter in front of a Jun
ior; Rule three said that they 
couldnt enter by the upper aper
ture (whatever that means); Rule 
Four said that they couldnt wear 
any form of plaid till after Eas
ter; Rule five said they couldnt 
wear insignia from any other 
school; and Rule sixwell, Rule 
six I will just quoteSaid 
plebes shall not pour hot metal 
upon themselves, as the odor of 
burning flesh is disagreeable to 
the Juniors.

6. To promote, if it proves pos
sible, more activities between the 
three schools.
Louis Umbachs platform is as 
follows:
Lets get all the students be
hind Techs activities. During the 
War when student enrollment was 
low, CIT was little more than a 
degree factory. While education 
is certainly the primary purpose 
of this institution, there is far 
more to a well rounded college 
life than that!
This spring Tech will have its 
first post-war Spring Carnival; 
next fall we are promised a foot

few students have been carrying 
the burden thus far. It will re
quire the enthusiastic support of 
our whole student body to make 
ventures like these successful.

reputation is established. Lets 
continue the extracurricular tra

part of Techs past glory.

Casey Stine, among others.
Lastly, Joe Nutter and Bob 
Straka are members of both ODK 
and Delta Skull. Both these men 
are undoubtedly capable and de
serving, and the unusual situation 
arose because of an anomaly in 
national-local requirements plus 
the fact that ODK elections were 
held first. However, these socie
ties should be mutually exclusive. 
A man who makes both his junior 
year has little to expect later. Al
so, since membership in both or
ganizations is limited, two men 
otherwise eligible may be left out 
in the cold somewhere (though 
this was not the case here). I sug
gest a definite ruling in this un
usual case.
This ends the discussion. Sev
eral actions seem definitely indi
cated <though possibly not feasi
ble)
(1) That those with factors 
below 1.75 be definitely informed 
of their ineligibility.
(2) That the man accused of 
cheating either leave Scimitars or 
show why the existing proof is 
incorrect (remember he is inno
cent until proven guilty.)
(3) That Joe Nutter and Bob 
Straka take their choice of hon
orary and that two other eligi
ble (if there are any) be elect
ed to fill their places in the one 
which they drop. Also that a def
inite rule be made to prevent such 
a situation from again occuring.
If necessary the student body 
should be able to hold an electio* 
to carry through any such indi
cated action which is forgotten.

Notice
The housing situation for 
married veterans on campus is 
very critical. Anyone who 
knows where living accommo
dations for such veterans may 
be had, or who can supply 
such accommodations, is re
quested to contact Miss Agnes 
Bird in the Deans Office.
Married veterans are asked 
to be present at a meeting in 
Room 104, Industries Hall, at 
4:30 Friday to arrange a 
priority system for such hous
ing accommodations as can be 
found.
European Ex-GIs 
Enter Foreign Colleges
The great influx of G.I.s into 
American universities can be 
matched throughout Europe where 
reopened universities in the lib
erated lands are experiencing un
precedented enrollments. The 
great state University of Oslo in 
Norway is given as an example.
Oslos six thousand students are 
more than double the pre-wrar en
rollment. These students come 
from two groups, the veterans of 
resistance, captivity, or deporta
tion, and the newcomers from the 
high schools.
One-half of these students can
not find lodgings and are sleeping 
on cots in the gymnasiums of 
schools in the city. Most of the 
students lack good shoes and cloth
ing. Study books in foreign 
languages are greatly needed.
There is a great shortage of 
teachers and classes are unduly 
large. Doctors and dentists are 
needed in great numbers but there 
are inadequate laboratory and 
clinical facilities for the training 
of medical and dental students.
Eighty Norwegian students have 
come to the United States to study. 
Thirty have scholarships secured 
through the Institute of Interna
tional Education in various insti
tutions throughout the United 
States.

Swimming Party 
Next Social Affair
We cant offer the old swim
ming hole to you water lovers, 
but for second 'best we offer the 
Swimming Party which the Eve
ning Student Council is sponsor
ing on March 2, in the Gym
nasium Building.
A good swim is a good tonic 
for that overdose of spring fev
er that crops up about the first of 
March; so if you have that hot 
flush, too bulky clothes, a too 
dreary office, and that run-down, 
run-down feeling, be sure to set 
aside the date, March 2, for you 
and your friends to enjoy the 
Tech swimming hole.
Keep watching your PLAID for 
the newest details, get out that 
suit and mend up those moth 
holes for we will be looking for 
you.
Letter to the Editor
May this grateful evening stu
dent be permitted through the 
medium of the PLAID to congrat
ulate the persons or person re
sponsible for the new set-up of 
the TARTAN and the PLAID. 
Ive been reading the PLAID 
since my first semester at Tech 
Evening School back in 1938, and 
though I dont profess to know 
anything about newspapers, I 
wish to state that the new paper 
looks plenty o. k. to me. And, 
from what comments Ive heard 
from other students, the new fivecolumn sheet has a more profes
sional appearance than the for
mer four-column sheet.
I wonder, since Ive been per
mitted to write this much, if I 
couldnt be permitted a few more 
lines to offer a suggestion for an 
article that might prove of inter
est to other evening students. I 
feel that an article about Evening 
School professors would be of in
terest to new Evening School stu
dents. And also, since there are 
many new professors teaching at 
Tech Eve School, we older stu
dents would like to meet them 
through the PLAID.
Now that Ive said all Ive 
wanted to say, I hope this letter 
proves interesting enough to ap
pear in the next issue of the 
PLAID.
Students Register 
Second Semester
No matter how many times an 
evening student wanders through 
the maze that is set up in the 
Gymnasium for the purpose of 
registration, the process seems 
just as complicated and confus
ing. Such was the case during 
second semester registration last 
week. The students approached 
the first table with an air of con
fidence. This was something they 
had experienced before; they as
sured themselves that they 
would remember the procedure as 
they went along. However, their 
confidence was quickly diminish
ed when they found themselves 
making just as many mistakes, 
such as standing in the wrong 
line and forever handing the 
wrong people their cards, as they 
had on their first appearance at 
Carnegie Tech. In the Veterans 
Department, conditions were 
twice as annoying, as the lines in 
which the vets waited to secure 
the necessary papers were long 
and the waiting very tiresome. 
But soon they had passed down 
the long lines and emerged as 
full-fledged students of Carnegie 
Tech.
Writing this dirt column can 
really turn into a tough job, par
ticularly if every one behaves 
themselves throughout the week. 
Once there was a time when one 
didnt have to leave the PLAID 
office to get the dirt, but then we 
had girls like Dorothy Papa, Nan
cy Lewis, and Martha Borkovich 
to keep us posted on things hap
pening at Tech Evening School. 
But, Alas! they dont come to the 
PLAID office anymore and we cer
tainly miss them. Wonder where 
they can be tonight (sigh, sigh).
Wonder what happened to the 
boys in E-83 Friday night? It 
seems that a few of the boys were 
found making noises in the PLAID 
office instead of being in class 
(bad boys).
No sooner than we ran the ar
ticle about Joe Rymers leaving 
Pittsburgh for Buffalo, that who 
pops up into the PLAID office? 
Yep, thats right, none other than 
that genial Joe. Though he 
couldnt give any explanation of 
why he happened to be in Pitts
burgh rather than in Buffalo, we 
guess Tech is too deeply rooted in 
his blood.
You can tell that our Editor 
isnt here tonight, for the old adage 
still holds true that when the boss 
is away the help will play. I 
sound like a stool pigeon, dont I, 
but then I believe in the truth; or 
am I just trying to fill this col
umn?
It was pleasant listening to the 
boys reminiscing in the back
room about the good old times that 
they had formerly at Tech Even
ing School Banquets and Fred 
Vichich, the chairman in charge of 
the 31st Annual Engineers Ban
quet, promised the fellows present 
at the bull session that this ban
quet was going to be the best that 
was. And believe me, Fred will 
keep his word.
Another one of our missing 
misses is missing. Wonder what 
keeps all these beauties away from 
the PLAID office? Mystery! Mys
tery! Well, its too much for me; 
I guess thats another one for 
Sherlock Holmes.
Well, heres an item that we al
most missed. Jane Burlingham 
spent the weekend in Washington,
D. C.
Wonder just how long Chester 
has had those four cases of pop 
that Arlene accuses him of buying 
a couple of years ago and storing 
away for this inflationary period. 
But, *then, we know Chester 
wouldnt do a thing like that and 
still we hate to say we dont be
lieve Arlene!
Evening Student Council had 
their monthly meeting Sunday, 
February 10. The big issue at this 
meeting was getting plans under
way for the Engineers Banquet.
When a fellow has spent him
self, he calls quits, and thats just 
what Im going to do now. See 
you next week.

31 Annual Banquet
The Thirty-First Annual En
gineers Banquet has been an
nounced for Saturday evening, 
April 27, at the Gold Room, Ho
tel Roosevelt. The committee, 
which has been hard at work 
soliciting souvenirs and making 
arrangements, promises a very 
enjoyable banquet again this year 
not only good food but a gala 
program of speakers and enter
tainments. The committee also 
has a novel surprise for those 
attending which must remain a 
secretfor a while at least. Won

Valentines Dav%/From 6 to 60
February, the month of heroes 
and hearts! Being modern Misses 
and having no use for deceased 
heroes, well take the heartsany 
day.
Hearts in our young (?) lives 
began back in grade school when 
Mamas best friend prodded her 
young bashful son in our direction, 
hiding a sack of grimy cinnamon 
hearts inscribed with such sugary 
thoughts as to you and kiss 
me, and you kid. Somehow, 
hearts had only candy appeal then, 
or was it the gold digger in us? 
Maybe we shouldnt admit that we 
sent him one of those nasty things 
telling him to wipe his nose.
Then February 14, Junior High 
School style. Remember how the 
home rooms had Valentine mail 
boxes and we kept an eagle eye 
on its be-decked anatomy in case 
that cute tow head in the next 
grade should shyly pop a valentine 
in its greedy mouth, scribbled 
across with our name?
In high school we became more 
sophisticated; Valentines Day 
ceased to effect us outwardly. Our 
Valentine came in the mail with a 
genuine three-cent stamp. A 
really gorgeous creation of lace 
and pink ribbons and blue birds, 
and the gooiest verse of all. Our 
blase hearts wouldnt admit that 
we were touchedand curious be
cause our unknown admirer had 
been afraid to sign his name.
A good Whitmans Sampler was 
our Valentine when we became 
hard working girls and our suitors 
more casual in their presentation 
oop, excuse metheres the 
doorbellhope its an orchid this 
yearand from the one guy in 
the world that can make this heart 
of mine turn flip-flops.
Tickets for Student
New students entering Carnegie 
Tech Evening School this semester 
will be glad to learn that they are 
entitled to two tickets for each 
play produced by the Tech Drama 
Department. These plays are pre
sented periodically in the Little 
Theater in the College of Fine Arts 
and the dates of each play will be 
announced in the PLAID.
Tickets can be secured at Mr. 
McKelways office, Room 255, in 
the Administration Building.
Workers Needed
We hate to kep harping on a 
trite subject, but then what else 
can be dcn^e when, there is so much 
work to be done and so few to do 
it. So come out and help make 
this semester at Tech Evening 
School a success. ^Extra curricular 
work can be fun, honest it can. So, 
give it a try just once and find out 
for yourself.
Valentine Party Pars 
Usual Tech Success
We would like to be quoted as 
saying that The Valentine Party 
was a swell affair because it 
really was. The Union was the 
perfect place for the event be
cause of the grand atmosphere 
and the easily adaptable game 
rooms.
First we looked in on the danc
ers, or that was the original idea, 
but we found ourselves in the 
midst of a noisy tag dance and 
came up with a choice male, 
dancing to an excellent collection 
of recordings. The P. A. system 
had even been perfectly repair
ed for the occasion.
We had to peek into the game 
room and were finagled into 
playing Chinese Checkers and 
ended up learning poker and 
pinochle. There was a bridge 
game in the corner but we never
Students Invited 
Eve. Study Room
For the benefit of new students 
and veterans just entering Techs, 
evening classes, we are quite cer
tain they will be interested in 
learning about Room 130 on the 
first floor of Industries Hall. This 
room is one devoted exclusively to 
the evening students who wish to 
study from the hours of when
ever the first fellow arrives till 
the last one leaves.
The room is furnished with in
dividual desks and lamps with the 
purpose of supplying a quiet study 
room for those arriving on cam
pus before their classes start. Ac
commodating 15 to 20 students, the 
well-lighted atmosphere and com
fortable lounge chairs provide a 
really conducive setting for study.
Located on the first floor of In
dustries Hall, Room 103 is about 
half-way down the hall from the 
Registrars office. If the room is 
dark when you arrive, dont hesi
tate to go in and turn on the lights. 
For economys sake, the last one 
going out leaves the room dark.
Many students who share rides 
with others find themselves wait
ing anywhere from 1 to IV2 hours 
after class for their friends. And 
others, who do not have time to 
go home for their evening meal 
and have too much spare time 
when they eat on campus, find 
themselves in the same position 
time to kill. Why not, next occa
sion, go to your study Room on the 
first floor of Industries Hall and 
spend your time the profitable 
way?
did get over there.
There was still enough energy 
left to amble down to the base
ment and watch a fast game of 
ping-pong, and believe me, thpse 
lads and lassies must have had 
lots of practice.
Just as we were about to col
lapse from sheer visual exhaus
tion, the call of grub came 
down. Those sandwiches were up 
to par Tech and really good as 
evidenced by the way they were 
gobbled down; cookies, candy and 
soft drinkscouldnt be beaten.
It was a swell affairtheres 
no doubt, and we all left with 
satisfied hearts and stomaches 
and new friends to add to our in
creasing scope of evening stu
dents. The Evening Student 
Council, as usual, did a dandy 
job.
Seek Knowledge 
Use Libraries
Many evening students are not 
aware of the libraries that are 
available for their use. There are 
times when reference work is re
quired in classes, and new stu
dents are at a loss as to just 
where they may find the neces
sary information. This is when 
students should take adtfa* 
of the libraries which are 
to them.
The largest library, a general 
one, is located on the second floor 
of Industries Hall. Also in this 
building is a social relations li
brary for those taking courses in 
that department.
On the left side, inside the en
trance to Machinery Hall, a tech
nical library and study room are 
situated. This library is devoted 
especially to mechanical refer
ence subjects.
Any one interested in physics 
and chemistry will be happy to 
know that in Engineering Hall is 
located a library and study room 
pertaining to these specific sub
jects.
Art students will be glad to 
know of the library in the Fine 
Arts Building for reference work 
connected with courses in the Art 
and Drama Departments.
These libraries are open from 
6 to 9 each evening for the bene
fit of evening students. Much val
uable information can be found in 
these libraries if only one takes 
advantage of it.
New Tartan
[continued from page I] 
or Clara Herrons leadership were 
held with Professor Siegfried, who 
volunteered his assistance to the 
paper. Revolutionary ideas were 
brought forth, discussed and ham
mered into usable form. When 
Gus Kermes submitted his design 
for a new name-plate, everyone 
was inspired. Tangible results 
were forthcoming. The design was 
adopted and other improvements 
were decided upon in short order. 
With the delighted approval of 
the printer, the type was reduced 
from the antiquated ten-point to 
the more modern eight-point 
height. Also,, it was decided, that 
the five-column page would re
place the four-column set-up. 
New feature heads,titles, and 
typefaces werealso used as a 
result of constant conferences 
among" Ifie editor, the ma*naging 
editors, Augie Binder, Boo Girts, 
and Professor Siegfried. Mary 
Jane Horridge and Ben Schwartz, 
the news and assistant news edit
ors, developed a new and more 
efficient news gathering system in 
order to fill the larger pages. Finally, on the afternoon of SundayFebruary 3rd, the entire staff met 
and proceeded to put the new 
Tartan together. The staff rooms 
were veritable beehives of activi
ty. Copy poured in as the news 
services worked better than ever. 
Professor Siegfried spent the en
tire afternoon in the papers of
fice working on the new. lay-out.  
By Monday afternoon everything 
was down at the printers, and  
everyone sat back to await the 
new issue. .
On Tuesday when the new 
Tartan finally appeared on cam
pus, proud staff members loitered 
near the distribution points hop
ing to overhear exclamations and 
comments. People came, grabbed 
their copies, mentioned matterof-factly  Oh, a new head and 
casually went their way. Some, 
didnt make even that small" state? 
ment. Disappointed bt Still hope
ful staff members Jingr.ed .oh; 
but they eventually junked subtle 
tacticsfor a more'aggressive ap
proach. Cornering the unenthusiastic readers, they cried: Its a 
NEW TARTAN, five'columns, see, 
smaller type, new heads, big 
changes. Didnt you notice? Oh, 
muttered the poor students, so 
it is.
