Varsity And Plebe Candidates Prepare 
For Track Opener

Coach Guy Halferty 
Much Worry
Season Opens April 14
Additional Men Are Urged 
to Report to Field for 
Practice
Although the weather up to this 
time has been none too good for 
serious attention to the track pros
pects of this year, Coach Iialferty 
has a representative group of last 
year's team as a nucleus for the 
approaching meets, the outcome of 
vhich the squad members look 
-ward to with a rather pessi5tic attitude. The team was deved of many stars by graduation 
id also by ineligibility and addi
tional men arc urged to report for 
practice. Those of you that run 
and make your eight-thirty math 
classes are especially urged to come 
out. Halferty has developed good 
track men in the past from inex
perienced material and he wants 
all those that can do anything at 
all to report to him.
Among the most promising look
ing of last years squad is Captain 
Merten who specializes in the high 
and broad jumps and to a some
what lesser degree in the pole 
vault. .Kennedy is the only sprint
er left from last years array and 
unless additional men arc solicited 
(or these events, Carnegie will have 
to spot their rivals many points 
in the short distances. In the quar
ter mile event Halferty is fortunate 
in having two men like Rhodes 
and Murdoch, but since four men 
convpose' the relay team there is 
 an excellent opportunity for two

Topics of Commercials Theses
As if four years of card-playing 
and bull-sessions at Carnegie were 
not enough to "finish any aspirant

degree, the head of that depart
ment demands a thesis before 
graduation, from the notable latcThursday-night theme writer class! 
The choice of subject matter is 
unlimited, and may vary from the 
"aroma of violets to the intricacies 
of steel manufacturing. If there 
lurks within the innermost recesses 
of any Commercial Senior a sup
pressed ambition or secret hobby, 
he has ample opportunity to de
vote his time to research on that 
particular subject, (and to atone 
for any previous demarcations re
ceived from the department) by 
his brilliant efforts on thishis 
final splurge before the powersthat-be. The theses may be pre

judged accordingly.

W. A. A. Party
Last Wednesday the W. A. A. 
Board ^avc a party in M. M. 
"Rec." Hall for Carnegie women, 
marking the close of the winter 
sports season.
Three times each year the Board 
holds a party so that it may pre
sent publicly athletic insignia to 
the women who have earned them. 
During the last two W. A. A. 
events, the banquet last June and 
the fall awards party, the Board 
has happily been able to award a 
letter to at least one womail at 
each affair. On Wednesday the 
Board made its third consecutiye 
award of a Carnegie letter since 
last spring to Harriet Hanna, 
senior music student. There are 
now three letters on the campus 
worn by Carnegie womentwo in 
M. M. College and one in the 
Arts College. The Board hopes 
that it' will be able to award 
more than one letter <*at its next 
spring party.
There were also two pins award-, 
ed; one to Doris Mather, M. M. 
junior, and one to Floy Sample, 
M. M. sophomore. Floy is to be 
especially congratulated, for it is 
unusual for a lower classman to 
t arn her pin. Keep it up, Floy.
(Mass numerals were awarded to. 
Elizabeth Lilley, sophomore; Mar
garet Zcnk, junior;- Elizabeth 
Mitchell, junior; Maybclle Steele, 
sophomore, and Laila Ikola, sopho
more.
In addition to the presentation 
of awards, the first "honorarics 
ever to be announced at Carnegie 
were the most skillful and sports
manlike basketball players and 
swimmer of the past winter sea
son. Each of the honorarics re
ceived a scarlet and a gold ribbon, 
representing the two colleges, on 
one of which was a small gold 
"H seal. This small badge,  which 
the women will wear for a, week, 
is the only recognition that they 
will receive, as there are no ath
letic points awarded foe this honor.
There  were seven honorarics" 
in basketballKatherine Palen, 
Imogcnc Schorey, Laila Ikola, Al
berta Parker, Dorothy Engroff, 
Floy Sample, and Anne Bibza; and 
only one in swimmingDorothy

Students Expecting 
To Complete Courses 
This Year, Please Note
The annual Carnegie radio hour 
was broadcast by KDK' on Tuesday 
evening, March 11, from the Car
negie Music Hall. The program was 
arranged and supervised by Prof. 
Leighou and if those who listened in 
enjo3rcd the program as much as those 1 
who witnessed the broadcast, the 
hour was a complete success.
The program opened in true Scot
tish fashion with bagpipes played by 
Mr. John Blackall. After Dear Old 
Tech and college yells came greet
ings to alumni by Buddy Overcnd, 
se-ire tary-treasurer', of the Pittsburgh 
Clan and gradual: manager of Tech 
athletics. 'Head football coach Wad 
dell was to speak but was unexpected
ly called out-of-town.
Carnival Overture, . Op. 92 by 
Dvorak was played by the student 
orchestra under the direction of J. 
Vick OBrien. An excellc.it interpre
tation of this work even, though the 
perciusioh seemed a ittle harsh at times.
President Thomas .S. Baker gave an 
address on Our Ambitions for Car
negie in wjiicli he outlined the pro
gram of the school and emphasized 
the progress made by the Night 
School and of its value to the various 
Industries located throughout /the 
Pittsburgh district.
Several songs by the Men's Glee 
Club and the Womens Glee Club 
were on the program as well as two 
numbers by the Faculty quartet.
Two violin solos by Miss. Katherine 
Rickcrt of the Department of Music 
were thoroughly enjoyable. Her un
tiring execution of the Pracludiutn 
anfl Allegro h Pugnam-Kreislet' 
won for her the aadmiration of all 
those who saw herplay. Would that 
RLC had more opportunity to hear 
the student orchestra and the solo
ists from the Mus department.
A touch of football atmosphere was 
given the program by the presence 
of the Kiltie Band. The band, under 
'the leadership of student director 
Tommy Connelly, played several num
bers.
Of course no college program of 
this nature would be -complet with
out the schools Alma Mater. Asa 
fitting climax, to this Carnegie hour 
of the air, the combined forces of 
the Womens and Mens Glee Clubs 
assisted by the orchestra rendered the 
Alma Mater in an inspiring fashion 
after which Louis Kaufmann, the an
nouncer, signed us off. G. '

; I was somewhat disappointed last 
Week when I received my copy 
of the Tartan. It seemed rather 
, slim. I dont mean news, but size. 
The issue of March 11 was a 
wow, and I thought we were going 
to have the full size again. I am 
doomed to disappointment. Its a 
real paper, however, and I am glad 
that I get a copy of it. I dont be
lieve-there is another college paper 
:n the country that can put up any 
.better paper. Maybe when they 
see this they will put me on the 
taff ten years from now.
I . remember in the early fall 
reading about the "Floating Uni
versity, and I am wondering what 
has become of it. I suppose^ they 
have about completed the trip by 
this time. It sure, -would be fine 
to be on such a cruise. Wonder 
how it would be /to have night 
school on a steamship. This is 
an idea, all you would do' would 
besleep in the daytime, and then 
report at your classes in the eve
ning. Say, wouldnt that be just 
about the last thing. Somebody 
better start such a course, and 
charter the boat to the east pole, 
if there is such a place, and see 
h6w many night students they 
will getI will be one.
I see where there are two smok
ers scheduled for this week on 
the Campus at night. Well, have 
a heart. How can a poor night stu
dent attend two smokers in one 
week. You know me, I cant miss 
anything, and I am wondering how. 
I can attend both of them. I am 
trying to arrange an irregular 
schedule, thats what they call' it, 
whenyou have too many classes 
and too little time for them, isnt 
itr-so that I can be present at both 
these smokers. That is, if I dont 
get waylaid and prevented from at
tending both of them.
They sure do have a lot of activi
ties foi the night students, and 
they are well supported too. I 
have been to most of these func
tions and have always, seen a large 
attendance. The night students pro
moting these gatherings certainly 
are to be commended for their 
efforts. If you all felt as I do I 
am sure that the halls would not 
be large enough to hold one-fifth 
of-all that would attend.
I noticed a short while back, an 
article relative plays in the Drama 
Dept., and a reference to tickets 
'which the night students 1 desired 
but could not secure. I am wonder
ing how 1 could get some. I 
didnt, Jcnow they had such a show 
house out here. I have been look
ing for it, maybe some day I will 
find' it before school closes, and 
then just watch me crash the gate/- 
"ticket or no ticket.
. Just bought a copy of the Carm'gie -Song Book. This appears to 
be a new number on the Campus.' 
Well, ic is about as fine : a song 
book as I have ever seen. - Better 
get yours before they are all 
sold.. The 'book contains a num
ber of very fine songs and alsosome very good views of the 
Campus. In addition to this a 
number of Fraternity songs are in
cluded. All in all, it makes a very 
desirable song book to own.
Today, in a loeked room in the Crane labora
tories, can be seen a chcrry-rcd bar of metal. 
In a specially devised air-tight cylinder, under 
constant temperature of i6oo at fixed 
stress, it is being given the iooo hour flow 
test. At the same temperature, at various 
stresses, it will be given the same test for the 
same time-period.
It won't be long now! Long 
till what?  Holy sassafras, man, 
dont tell me that you have for
gotten the Second Semester Smok
er of the College of Industries to 
be held in the gymnasium audi
torium this Saturday?' Well, thats 
better, sure, every night Industries 
student can go. All that is needed 
for remission is your registration 
card and one of the tickets being 
distributed throughout the corri
dors of the Industries building.
The program for the evening is 
about completed. Of course, there 
will be smokes. What is a smok'er 
without smokes,. I ask you? A 
couple of movies will be shown. 
Hard to tell what they will be 
but "Uncle Toms Cabin will not 
be one of them. We have been 
told that a cofipleof gallant gentlement will entertain us for a little 
while with an exhibition of the no
ble art of poking a sword into each 
others anatomy: Fear ye not of
any bloodshed, as the fencers will 
use regulation foils, which are 
harmless, unless, of course, you, use 
them as a whip, then they sting. 
Check and 2 times check 
. If the one' and only Sam Baijey, 
that Ethiopian playboy from East 
Liberty, concludes his sojourn to 
somewhere or other in time for the 
smoker we arc assured of some 
mean harmonica playing and -other 
forms  of darkey entertainment.
The athletic sho.w of the eve
ning will include a wrestling match 
and two boxing bouts. The wrest
ling: match will bring together 
Omar Held, State Y. M. .C. A. 
heavyweight champion, and Jimmy 
Geyser, who has been defeated by 
Held, and ranks second in the 
State heavyweight division. Geyser 
will be outweighed about 25 pounds, 
but his determination to win should 
make this a good match. Inci-1 
dentally we might mention  that 
Iield: is a professor of Psychology 
at our neighborhood school, Pitt,1 
which adds a bit more rivalry to 
this -match. Theboxing bouts 
have, been arranged but the prin
ciples are'as yet unknowm, so we 
cant give you any advance dope 
on the "Whos Who of Sock.
The Kilty Band will be there in 
full uniform to provide the music 
fqr 'the evening. This is an ex
cellent opportunity for those who 
have never seen this organization 
to witness the performance of these, 
loyal Carnegie players.
Ylie evening will be topped off 
with eats and when we say eats we 
mean eats, for that Industries gan# 
certainly docs know how to spread

Some Facts On The 
Life Of Winslow Homer
Winslow Homers work is great 
and inspiring. He tells his message 
with a directness and by methods 
which make AL forget paint and 
think only of the mighty ocean and 
its danger-filled life. Winslow Homer 
was born-in Boston in 1S36 and died' 
at his home-in Maine in 1910.
He will always be lassed among 
the immortals. The rugged character
istics he possessed as a man have 
found expression in his pictures. He 
withdrew from the city life and went 
to live, almost as a recluse, on the 
rock bound -oast of Maine. He 
calne from a family of sea-faring 
people and he knew the pitiless power 
of the sea,and. the hard life of those 
who followed it. .
The "Outlook and "The Life 
Line are two of his most famous 
paintings. Homers pictures arc al
ways simple iii line. In the picture 
Moonlight : there are only three 
shapesthe sky, the moving water, 
and the shorebut the arrangement 
of these, shapes and the drawing of 
their outline has been made by the 
deepest study.
There is a strong contrast to the 
tossing waves and ^he billows of 
foam which rise against the dark 
sky. In Homers pictures of the sea, 
its surface is sometimes smooth and 
glassy, and its quiet waters look as 
though they could n-ver rouse them
selves to the furious action one secs 
in the others of his sea picture^.
W.E.Z.
The tests are being made at the request of an 
oil man who has asked for valves for an exper
imental still, to operate at 1500 and 2500 
pounds. Can he have them? At th6 end of the 
exhaustive tests, Metallurgist L. W Spring 
will be able to tell him, exactly,authoritatively ,
Since the first Crane chemical and testing 
laboratory was founded in 1888, thousands 
of similar questions so vital to safe and eco
nomical industrial progress, have been asked 
and answered. The contribution made by 
Crane metallurgists to scientific knowledge 
of the reaction of metals under high pressures 
and temperatures is known and respected 
throughout the world, is familiar to every oil 
man who has used the cracking process and 
every engineer who has to do with piping.

Marriage and College
(Oregon Emerald),
Seeing the name of a married woman leading the list of 
individual high grades for fallterm with 05 pointsthe perfect 
rradebrings forth arguments regarding the merits and draw
backs of attending college when married.
A well-known professor on the Oregon campus a year ago 
said in a lighter vein, Every student should be married before 
he or'she comes to collegea startling assertion, but contain
ing considerable good psychology.
What would happen to the moral problems of the big 
university if all students were married? Would not such a 
jituation alter the economic problems? All mottoes to the 
tontrary, two persons require t\vo and one-half persons salary 
to live on. Frivolity and courting then would be unknown 
college work would be undertaken with increased earnestness 
ind the results from four years study would be far greater.
The picture of a university where there were no single 
Itudents is an intriguing one. No fraternities or sororities. 
Fewer dances. Less money spent .on amusements, fewer pen
nies spent on "bites in wayside inns, Life would be more 
serious.
Talk of dates and chit-chat on subjects airy and inconsciqucntal as indulged ill by women, and fireplace talk on weighty 
matters which characterizes fraternity men would metamorphose 
into talk of rent bills, clothes, and unromantic subjects like 
lawn-mowers. _ ; r
Young married couples have in the past tried college life 
together. Girls \vho have a Mrs. in front of their names will 
'be found to look at studies and classes more seriously than 
their unattached sisters. The social life is paled before the 
steadfast work ambitions of young married men in school. Soitictimes it is hard for them to understand the light manner in 
which the unwed look at a collcgc education.
Smiles that were once on the brow arc eclipsed by the 
doubled money worries. Single, a man secs the future as a 
more-or-less filmy castle in the distance. Married, the castles 
outlines disappear and he is face to face with a blank, unwritten 
future. In his hand he. has the pen with which lo write. So 
lie sets about to learn, perfecting the crude methods he picked 
up while lie was joyously coasting through collcgc.
College is the place some call the last stronghold of youth, 
the place for a last spree of fun and jollity. Life seems by 
turns distant or just around the curve. Alternately, youth is 
eager to try its wings or afraid of the leap which must come. 
Whether married life should intrude itself upon the life of the 
college student, as an oil on troubled waters, is debatable, Cer
tain it is that the college student would get more out of his 
collcgc education in a material way, but in gaining this he 
would lose the social broadening and fellowship of a wide circle 
of friends in both-sexes, which circlc lie is able to create through 
freer contact which a collcgc community provides.

tests, there will be conducted in the 
new Materials and Hydraulic Re
search Laboratories of Machinery 
Hall tests of model dams. An 
illustration of camouflage will be 
given in Room 113, while Room 
118 will contain an advertising ex
hibit of the products of the greater 
industries of Pittsburgh.
A Retreat Parade by the Reserve 
Officers T raining Corps will be 
held under the direction of the 
Military Department. It is sched
uled to begin at 6:30 on the cut.
The Concrete and Masonry Shop 
n Industries Building will have on 
Exhibition an Italian' village square 
built entirely by students. Officials 
of Carnegie estimate that, according 
to: past experience, at least twelve 
thousand visitors will pass through 
the model village at the annual 
Exhibition.
Additional features on the pro-. 
: gram will consist of recitals by the Department of Music, and plays by 
I he Department pf Drama, in the 
Little Theater of the College ol 
Fine Arts; concerts by the Kiltie 
Band in the men's gymnasium; exIvbitions of swimming by members 
of the varsity swimming team in 
the .pool; exhibits of student work 
in the studios of the Collcgc of 
Fine Arts; exhibits of huts, go\Vns, 
coats and childrens clothing in the 
Department of Costunio Economics, 
and exhibits of class work in the 
Household Economics Department, 
in Margaret Morrison.
VARSITY AND PLEBE
(Continued from Page One) 
squad. In the half mile there is 
nobody that has shown any real 
form up to the present time with 
the possible exception of Franks. 
In the mile and two mile there is 
also a big opportunity for begin
ners as Schaffer, Leitz and Brown 
arc the only ones that have run
these distances. In the hurdles, 
which is perhaps the race requir
ing the, most practice of the track 
events, there arc McFarlin and 
liockcnbachcr. Those that have 
ever done or tried to do anything 
in the weight events should report 
for practice for this year, as al
ways, there is a shortage of ma
terial in all of these events.
These above names arc simply 
hangovci's from last year and will 
not' by any means constitute the 
team that will represent Carnegie 
in the coming meets. Last year's, 
freshmen have yet to be taken in
to.; consideration, but the fact that 
tiack is a good way. for anybody 
to make a varsity letter should 
induce anybody that lias any abil
ity 'whatsoever to report to Coach 
Halfcrty as soon as possible.
The varsity season will be open
ed by the P. A. A. meet on April 
19. This meet is an annual affair 
and gives the coach a chance to 
te^t his men before the collegiate 
season opens. The next Saturday 
the varsity journeys to Cleveland 
for a meet with Western Reserve. 
The Red and White is a new op
ponent for the track team and 
furnish the only trip aside from 
the Big jFour meet that the team 
will \ake this season. Geneva and 
W. & J. follow as opponents in 
dual meets on the home track and 
then comes the annual meet with 
Fitt at the Stadium. Then conics 
the Big Four meet which is spon
sored by W. & J. this year. It 
will be held in Morgantown this 
year since W. & J. i.> not ai pres
ent able to handle a meet of this 
magnitude. A week later the cur
tain will be rung down with the 
Grove City meet .in the bow'M.
The freshmen schedule includes 
dual meets with Schenley and Tur
tle Creek, . Union High ' Schools, 
Shadyside Academy, Pitt Freshmen 
and Indiana State Teachers College. >

whiah every idea will be conveyed 
to the receiver with, the exact 
amount of ardor, bellicosity, or pighcadedncss with which il was sent 
forth by the writer. We havent 
seen or heard about the results of 
this one yet, but it bids fair to be 
most interesting, taking into ac
countas it surely mustthe intel
ligence of both parties concerned, 
and their peculiar colloquialisms 
and idiosyncrasies. When this sub
ject has been completed and ex
hausted Dorothy Dix is holding in 
reserve two particularly puzzling 
letters from Blue Eyes, and 
"Worried, which demand imme
diate attention and explanation.
And now, with praiseworthy zeal, 
one soul has chosen .the colossal 
subject of The Study of Crime.1 
His bravery is commendable, but 
lie will need, to be sustained by 
vast amounts'of patience and 
bullet-proof vest or two if lie 
would obtain authentic, first-hand 
information. This first-hand knowl
edge of the underworld, its char
acters, and the motives propogating 
their crimes can be gained only by 
intimate associationalthough it is 
to be earnestly hoped that there 
will not be - one less, to answer 
Carnegies 8:30 roll class, in favor 
of Chicago; However,' the title 
may be only indicative of a peace
ful survey ' of statistics, with a 
philosophical eye to the remedying 
of the present evils, or it may be 
gained from the sessions spent 
viewing dastardly crimes, on the 
flickering talkies.  Surely a reform 
mission would, furnish excellent 
background for this discussion, 
while if one could stand the phys
ical and financial shock, the ter
rifying experience of a hold-up 
would be gratifying in the extreme.
From this detailed subject to the 
oiic of road - extension isa big 
jump, but nevertheless one that 
must-' be made in our perusals of 
this list; and lo  and behold the 
author of the Feasibility of .Con
tinuing the New Allegheny Boule
vard Through Oakmont"' is' none 
other than a well-known columnist 
of this paper. (Further disclosure 
of idcntiy seems unnecessary, and 
WtJ only regret that we have not 
been supplied with more names, a* 
situation's there are. probably equal
ly .nrongruou.). It would seem 
that a prerequisite to a discussion 
}f such import would be a jaunt 
to the town of Oakmont, but thus 
far we have been spared the 
bumps!
Did you know that age bears a 
definite relation to scholastic abil
ity? You may have guessed it be
fore, but we iad no idea that the 
superior 'mathematical instinct evi
denced ly the joy and despair .of 
the Senior Commercials was caused 
by the distinct advantage of his 
advent into lthis world exactly that 
many months before any of the 
rest of them. Undoubtedly it isiiH 
fair to the majority of we intel
lectual pygmies, but just exactly 
what is there lo do about it? Maybe 
ho will reveal a solution or two 
in his expostulation. It will be 
interesting to await developments.
The moral side always enters into 
the most, technical cf discussions, 
and this time it crops up with 
Do the' People of Pittsburgh Want 
Sunday Movies? Whether they 
want them or not as a collective 
unit doesnt seem to matter very 
much, as the present situation is 
indicative of the fact that those 
who want them have their -wish, 
satisfied, and those who do not 
may sit home in envious discontent 
in pious condemnation. . We 
suggest that the Press substitute 
a' popular .ballot (something like 
the one that made the Literary 
Digest famous) for those intermin
able puzzles,  submitting the above 
question to the general public of 
Pittsburgh, and then acting upon 
the popular. decision.
Seven Baker Brothers and Tech 
by this time have doubtless1 estab
lished a co-operative union on a 
commercial basis, for one  of the 
subjects chosen wrasThe Cost of 
Production of a Loaf of Bread. 
Perhaps lie kneads the dough when 
the -machines break down, lie may
be chief sampler of the yca%t cakes, 
ormost plausible of alllie may 
either wash their utensils employed 
in the process or sign a contractguaranteeing that lie buy a speci
fied amount of their bread during 
the time they furnish him with 
data. At any rate the maxim The 
Bread of Life will be no empty 
phrase in his young -life! 1

New Alcove Added To The Hut For 
Dr. John A. Brashears Collection
An interesting collection of over 
400 scientific and historical booksi 
the gift of Dr. John A. Brashcar. 
M < eminent Pittsburgh astronomer, 
has been catalogued and shelved iil 
a newly-opened 'a 1Y> v e of the 
Campus Library. Besides scien
tific works, there are several com
prehensive books oil the history 
c; Pittsburgh and the biographies 
of prominent men of Pittsburgh; 
many of these volumes are. very 
old, one being -published in 1748.
The scientific volumes, ^vhich are 
fotihd iti the Brashca'r ; collection, 
Include works oii' lilvysics,'"astron
omy, chemistry, mathematics, and 
evolution. "Scicticc ;liid Hebrew 
Tradition1 is1 a unique'"''book,' writr 
ten by the renowhed English natur
alist, Tliomas H. Fluxlcy.  There 
arc also seven botiiid ' vdluiVics of 
Science, the popular magazine, 
which were published during the 
years 1883-1886 and forty bound 
volumes of ihc English Mechanic 
printed between 1866-1886.
This collection w'ill add' several 
old, but thorough, histories of 
Pittsburgh, probably now the most 
comprehensive in the Library. The 
Standard History of Pittsburgh, 
cdi cd by Erasmus Wilson, con
tains nearly 1000 pages, is well 
illustrated, and is unusually com
plete; the same is true of Sarah 
Killikcllys Ilistory of Pittsburgh." 
Another, vAluablc histo'ry,' which1 is 
also diverting and entertaining, is 
Great Men of 'Pittsburgh, by

Many of the books of theBra

printed in 1748 in Cambridge, Eng
land, is of much historical and 
antique interest. Its title is A 
System of Natural Philosophy by 
T Rutherford, Chaplain to his 
Royal Highness, the Prince of 
Wales. Of even more historical 
value is the History of. the Revotions in Europe, from the French 
of Christopher W i l l i a mu Foch,

JESSIE STEPHENS
The annual gift day, held by the 
school's Junior misses, is a thing 
of the past. The Womens Junior 
Prom, held last Friday in the Ur
ban Room of the William *Pcnn, 
turned out to be a very enjoyable 
affair, and the entire - committee 
certainly deserves the plaudits of 
the multitude. Xs faras we could 
see, the only mistake the commit
tee - made was in placing George 
Suitt at the door. But since George 
had a policeman right beside liirh, 
and since the majority of cash salps 
took place beforehand, the com
mittee suffered little, if any,, from 
a financial standpoint, as far as we 
could sec. .Justa little bad pub
licity, thats all.
There were lots of high spots 
o>n tap for all concerned, too. 
President Mather ^certainly did her 
"best to look very-shy*and demure,
