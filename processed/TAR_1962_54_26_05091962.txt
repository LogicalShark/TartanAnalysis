The 1962 version of Scotch n 
Soda, Viv, opened Monday to 
run through Thursday. For this 
years production many things are 
different from previous years. 
There is a new home for the 
Scotch n Soda Theaterin the 
Skibo Ballroom; there is the new 
concept of the strictly on-campus 
show, stemming from the belief 
that an amateur dramatics gi'oup 
as S n S should not only be of 
and by the students, but for 
the students. This year, under the 
guidanc of Bus. Manager R. J. 
Levison, there was a complete ab
sence of the lavish and often 
careless spending of some past 
productions.
The most unique feature of 
this years show, however, has 
been the spirit. About three 
months ago, when many things 
looked black for Scotch n Soda, 
the eleven-member Board made 
a pact that there would be, no 
matter what the obstacles, a show 
this yearand a good one.
Since then, this determined 
spirit has transcended from the 
Board to the nearly one hundred 
other people who have worked on 
the show. The spirit must be 
there for them to have made the 
sacrifices they have. The show 
has been so demanding of them 
that all have given up every
thing else but school. Some have 
had to give up sleep to complete 
some of the more tedious tasks.

Hard Working 
Staff Produces
PATTERNS
Three years ago, in 1960, the 
seed of an idea was planted on 
this campus. The idea was that 
the creative, artistic abilities of 
the students could be given an 
outward expression in the form of 
a literary-arts magazine. The seed 
grew and by Spring Carnival of 
that year, the first edition of
PATTERNS magazine was on 
sale. And so every spring since 
then has seen this maturing idea 
molding itself into a better, more 
direct statement of what the Car
negie Tech student can create in 
a graphic-literary form.
The labor of the people who be
came interested in PATTERNS 
this year has produced a complete 
and unified work of art composed 
of the highest quality stories, 
poems, and prints produced on this 
campus. PATTERNS 1962 spans 
the world from the Hill District in 
Pittsburgh to the windy, rain 
washed hills of Ireland and pene
trates into the human soul from 
its deepest agony to its highest 
joy. The staff of PATTERNS 
magazine is proud to announce 
that its 3rd edition will be on sale 
during Carnegie Techs 1962 
Spring Carnival.

Orientation 
Important For 
Freshmen Ideas
At the beginning of each year, 
prior to and during registration, 
Carnegie Tech holds a freshman 
orientation week. Practically 
everyone on campus has partici
pated in it, in one respect or an
other, but how many of us have 
given any consideration to the 
reason for this week.
They are the first days the 
freshmen will spend upon this 
campus and in many ways his 
attitudes towards Tech will be 
shaped by them. He knows little 
if anything about C.I.T. upon ar
rival and we must slowly intro
duce it to him. This year there 
will be the tours, the meetings, 
the dances, the assemblies, and 
the general sessions. They all 
serve many purposes: to acquaint 
the freshman with the physical 
structure of the campus, to intro
duce him to his dean and depart
ment, to give him the opportunity 
to ask questions, and to offer him 
the opportunity to meet his class 
and become a part of it.
A freshman comes to Tech and 
he must be oriented as rapidly 
and as painlessly as possible. We 
can not alleviate all of his fears 
and worries, but we can lessen 
the basis of some of them and 
prove some of them to be need
less. In essence this is the rea
son for orientation week, to help 
the freshman relax, understand, 
and belong.

Editorial
Congress Needs Your Support
During the past year there has been much 
comment about Student Congress. The Tar
tan editorial on February 21, 1962 by Sally 
Ganong Farrell stated that Congress has an 
inability to accomplish anything of signifi
cance and should evaluate its own purpose 
and functions on campus. This was followed 
the week lated by letters from Bill Ellis, and 
Jane Scott, Tom Ference, and Mark Applbaum defending Congress. The general stu
dent viewpoint has ranged all the way from 
the belief that Student Congress is taking on 
more responsibility than it should, to the idea 
that Congress serves no useful purpose on 
campus.
Whatever you, as a student, feel about the 
activities of Student Congress now is the 
time to express yourself. The elections pick
ing the new representatives were just two 
weeks ago, and the election of Student Con
gress officers will be held this afternoon at 
4:30 in Wherrett Lounge. The new Congress 
is going to need new ideas. After today, new 
people are going to be faced with the ques
tions of what Congresss purpose should be, 
and what problems should it try to solve.
Last years Congress dealt with the prob
lem of what to substitute for Homecoming 
weekend next year, with the problem of stu
dent parking, with the problem of 7:30 a.m. 
common exams for freshmen, and with the 
scheduling of the school year, to mention 
only a few of the areas covered. Some of 
these problems still have not been completely 
solved.
Talk to your representative, find out 
what is happening in Student Congress, and 
tell him what your ideas are. If you have 
any complaints or ideas about how things 
should be done, tell the to your representaReaders Write
tive so that he can start Congress working on 
them.
If you are interested in what Student Con
gress is doing, attend the Congress meetings. 
They are held every other Wednesday at 
4:30 in Skibos Wherrett Lounge. There 
should be a notice in the Tartan every week 
there is a meeting. You do not have to be a 
Student Congress Representative to be heard 
in the meetings.
If you are interested in any of the activi
ties or problems of the campus and want to 
work where your own ideas and efforts will 
really have an effect, join one of the standing 
committees of Student Congress. There are 
committees which deal with the new Fall 
Festival, Spring Carnival, student activities, 
parking facilities. Freshman Orientation and 
Campus Chest, to mention just a few. The 
people on these committees and even the 
chairmen do not have to be Student Congress 
Representatives.
Student Congress works in many areas 
and has the potential to deal with many 
more. Many of these are areas which would 
be handled by the Administration if Congress 
did not provide the means for student ef
forts and student opinion to be effective. 
Congress can not continue to be effective 
unless it receives the support of the student 
body. Join a committee, come to the meet
ings, or at the very least, talk to your re
presentative. Keep an interest in Congress 
and think of ways Congress might serve you. 
If the students can continue to provide the 
ideas, the interest, and the efforts, there will 
be no necessity for another TARTAN editor
ial asking what purpose Student Congress 
really serves.

Expresses Thanks
Editor, the Tartan
I would like to express my 
thanks to the students and fac
ulty of C.I.T. for putting up with 
my appearance for the past three 
years.
I realize that it has been a 
great hardship for my instructors 
to be forced to stand up in front 
of my classes and look at my ter
rible physiognomy. They indeed 
deserve the highest accolade for 
their nerve-racking experience.
My fellow students deserve 
sympathy for having me in their 
classes, library, and Skibo.
In particular, I would like to 
thank the Fraternits. I realize 
that after several parties which 
I've attended, the attendence of 
all women has dropped. For them 
to accept this disaster and not 
throw me out the minute I ap
pear, I express my heart-felt 
gratitude.
Furthermore, I feel that the 
public relations staff and Mr. Ebner have done a tremendous job 
in explaining away my presence 
n campus. It was indeed a sur
prise to me to learn that there 
would be a freshman class during 
my sophomore year. I also was 
pleased to learn that Tech would 
be able to continue the develop
ment program with me on cam
pus. I was not even required to 
go to the fifth sub-basement of 
Machinery Hall when visitors 
were on campus. I remember, 
with particular delight, that dur
ing the Library dedication, I was 
allowed to stand in front of Skibo 
to watch. Of course, the curtains 
were drawn since the administra
tion didn't want to spoil every
ones lunch!
J realize that next years graduating class will have its copy 
of the Thistle ruined with my 
picture. I have tried to substitute 
a picture of Marilyn Monroe for 
mine, but this is improssible un
der existing rules. I am sorry 
that the students will have to 
pay $6 for a book with such a 
horrible picture. Maybe they can 
cut it out after they buy it.
Truely, I feel that you have 
suffered much. I think that you 
will be happy to hear that I think 
that I will be here only one more 
year, if the populace doesnt be
come aroused.
Very truly yours,
The Bear

Editor, the Tartan
It was a very hot and humid 
day. A large crowd had gathered 
for the Sorority Skits in the ball
room at Skibo. Chairs were at a

Reserve Room 
Silence Demanded
Editor, The TARTAN:
I wish to add my comments con
cerning the noise in the Hunt Li
brary and specifically in the re
serve book room.
I. There is a definite need for 
Quiet in the reserve book 
room. Many courses require 
the reading of materials kept 
there. There is only a limited 
number of most of the books. 
Thus, many students must 
read material important both 
for their education and for 
their factor in that room.
II. The reserve book room is not 
very quiet at present. It has 
become a place for the com
muters to wait for their 
car pools to leave. Earlier 
letters to the TARTAN have 
shown the student concern 
over the high noise level.
III. The library official must take 
definite action if the situation 
is ever to be corrected. While 
there are signs that many stu
dents are unhappy about the 
situation, they can do little to 
correct it as individuals. Also, 
there doesnt seem to be any 
way for them to unite. And, 
finally, I feel certain that the 
problem cannot correct itself. 
Thus, the library staff must 
draw up a definite plan to im
prove study conditions and 
the library staff must enforce 
that plan.
IV. Some suggestions of what the 
library officials should doA. Remove the librarian's 
typewriter from the re
serve book room.
B. Have the librarians, and 
student assistant, set the 
example by holding only

If I Were President ...
Faculty vs. Students
By Paul B. Farrell, Jr.
What will be the role of the faculty at Carnegie Uni
versity in the coming decades. Certainly it will be a re
warding and challenging role.
But before answering the question, we ought to con
sider the more general question of the role of the faculty 
at any college or university.
And since there are a wide range of types of colleges 
and universities, it is necessary to also consider the relation
ship of the role of the faculty in respect to the type of 
college or university.
The role of a member of the faculty is a dual role, he 
must on one hand be a teacher, and he must also continue 
to learn himself.
The roles of a university or college vary greatly, at one 
end of the scale we have schools like Harvard and Cal 
Tech which are primarly engaged in advancing the limits 
of human knowledge through research and creative works. 
We also have schools whose prime function as a school is 
to educate high school graduates for a job or possible higher 
education at a later date. At this end we have junior col
leges and preparitory, business, and technical institutions. ..
Of course these roles are more complex than this divi
sion, in any single instance. The roles vary with the schools, 
and within a particular school itself.
The divergence within a school is largely independent 
upon the degree to which a faculty member fulfills his two
fold function. At Harvard or Cal Tech the faculty enjoy a 
personal freedom and responsibility to carry on research 
and creative work which is not available to a junior college 
teacher.
Yet, whether a faculty member is at Harvard or at 
Pittsburghs Point Park Junior College, he must in some 
degree (1) educate students and (2) continue to educate 
himselfthat is, he must also be a student!
The interrelated roles of the faculty and the roles of 
the school are a direct function of the type student at the 
school.
The undergraduate student, particularly the freshman 
and sophomore, requires a different type of faculty member 
than a graduate student, or a professional student of law, 
medicine or engineering.
Twenty years ago Carnegie Institute of Technology was 
able to educate a professional person in four years. A grad
ual development in the past two decades has outdated this 
type of professional education. In recent years our fine 
faculty have become more conscious of this change in our 
students, in the nature of a professional education, and in 
our university.
There has been much discontent caused because we 
have not changed with the times, and have continued to ask 
a faculty member to be a graduate or professional educa
tor, and yet continue to supply him with undergraduates to 
teach. This will gradually change.
In the next decades Carnegie University will have the 
roles of research and creative work and the roles of teach
ing more clearly defined as we become more selective in 
our choice of students, and place the responsibility of their 
education in the hands of a single undergraduate college 
separate from the graduate and professional schools.
Within this framework of more clearly defined goals 
for the university, our faculty will be able, to best fulfill 
their individual roles as a teacherand as a student.

Looking Forward
A Historic Decision 
By Allan J. Topol
Last month the United States Supreme Court handed down what 
was unquestionably its most historic decision in the last eight years. 
The case was Baker v. Carr and it involved a claim by citizens of 
Tennessee that they were not receiving fair representation in the 
state legislature. In a 6-2 decision the Court decided that the Federal 
courts had a right to hear law suits challenging state apportionment 
of legislative districts, and that state apportionment must comply 
with the federal constitution which guarantees equal protection 
under the laws for all citizens.
This decision revealed to the country the glaring abuses in state 
legislatures arising from rural dominance. In an early era in Ameri
can life the rural areas were entitled to a much larger representation. 
As the cities have outstripped the rural areas in population growth, 
rural legislators have refused to yield their seats in favor of a more 
equitable representation.
The situation is such that in Tennessee the General Assembly 
has not reapportioned itself since 1901, despite a requirement in the 
state constitution of reapportionment every ten years. The result is 
that there is one member in the Tennessee House of Representatives 
for the 3,455 residents of Moore County while legislators from Mem
phis represent 78,000 citizens.
Yet this situation is not confined to Tennessee alone. The town 
of Stratton, Vermont, with a population of 38, has one seat in the 
Vermont House of Representatives. So does the city of Burlington 
with a population of 35,531. In California one State Senator repre
sents Los Angeles County  population 6,038,771  while another 
Senator represents Northern Californias cow counties  total popula
tion 14, 294. In Florida 12% of the states citizens can elect a majority 
of the State Senate and 15% a majority of the House. These are only 
a few of the many glaring evils of state apportionment.
The result is pretty obviously that city residents do not receive 
equitable representation. If one of the cornerstones of our demo
cratic government is its representative nature, then such a situation 
is hardly conducive to good government. In terms of legislation, the 
rural legislatures are able to block badly needed urban programs.
Now that it has been clearly shown that abuses in apportion
ment exist, let us now ask whether the laws of this country afford 
the voters in Tennessee or any other state a remedy for this problem. 
This question is easily answered in the affirmative by turning to the 
14th amendment of the U. S. Constitution which guarantees that no 
state may deny a citizen equal protection under the laws.
If the evils exist and the laws of the U. S. afford a remedy, does 
the Supreme Court have the power to provide the remedy, as it has 
done? In 1946 the Supreme Court in denying a petition of voters in 
Illinois, decided it did not have the power to correct these abuses 
because the question was a political thicket which should be lefi 
to political branches of the government. Yet in 1962 the court has 
completely reversed itself. Why?
The best answer to this question is that in the last 16 years the 
court has evolved as the fundamental protector of the national 
rights of American citizens. At one time in American history the 
legislative branch of our government provided this protection. Now 
the courts have assumed this power. When viewed in this light, the 
decision in Baker v. Carr, is perfectly consistent with school desegre
gation and other cases in which the court guaranteed national rights. 
Because the protection of these national rights is of paramount 
importance, the courts decision merits praise.
Yet the decision also has created some new problems. While the 
Court has given federal courts the right to require states to reap
portion, it has not decided under what conditions such reaportionment 
should be ordered-. The result becoming increasingly more apparent, 
is that similar suits from other states are rapidly being filed by voters. 
When these come before the Supreme Court, this body will be en
gaged in a mathematical quagmire in order to find some equitable 
rule.
These problems have arisen because the Supreme Court has been 
transformed by the inadequacy of Congressional Legislation into a 
body with super legislative powers. While the Court may never 
completely eliminate the problem of reapportionment, it will certain
ly alleviate some of the abuses.

Students Asked 
For I.D. Cards
The bicycle theft mentioned in 
a past weeks TARTAN is just one 
of several recent robberies in 
Techs fraternities, dormitories, 
and laboritories. Aware of this 
current wave of thefts, school de
tectives have been alerted to watch 
any persons acting suspiciously 
and to ask them to show their 
I.D. cards.
Anticipating that some odd situ
ations might arise from this pro
cedure, cartoonist Ron Wertel 
here depicts two such scenes.
Israel Site of 
Good Will Tour
A group of 50 college educators 
and Christian clergymen will 
leave for Israel on July 23, on 
the first Annual Study Tour to be 
sponsored by the Inter-University 
Committee on Israel, it was an
nounced today by its Chairman, 
Dr. Jacob I. Hartstein who is the 
Dean of Long Island University. 
Clergymen and educators who are 
interested in joining the 30-day 
Study Tour may apply for details 
at the offices of the Committee, 
located at 515 Park Avenue, New 
York City.
The Inter-University Commit
tee on Israel, organized in early 
I 1961, is a non-political body of 
American educators seeking to 
promote a better understanding 
between America and Israel 
through the initiation of a dia
logue between American and Is
raeli scholars and religious lead
ers, and the creation of oppor
tunities for the objective study of 
| Israels society.
j Members of the group will meet 
with their counterparts in Israel 
at seminars and conferences. They 
will also meet with governmental 
| leaders in an effort to gain insights 
into Israels problems in the build
ing of an integrated society who 
have come from widely divergent 
backgrounds. Participants will 
tour the length and breadth of 
Israel, visit the Holy Places, im
portant archeological sites, the 
major academic institutions, and 
have an opportunity at first hand 
to explore the cultural and re
ligious life of the country.

Kleinmuntz
Investigates
Computer
Dr. Benjamin Kleinmuntz, as
sistant professor of psychology at 
Tech, has received i. grant of 
$18,000 from the National Instij 
tute of Mental Health for re; 
search on Cumputer Simulation 
of Clinical Decision Making.
According to Dr. Kleinmuntz, 
there are relatively few diaj 
gnosticians who excel in interpet! 
ing objective personality tests. j 
One of his aims is to discover | 
how some of the expert test inj 
terpters think during the process j 
of clinical decision making. He j 
hopes to tape-record their clinij 
cal decision making and then to 
program the Carnegie Bendix G! 
20 electronic computer so that it 
thinks at least as well as some 
of the experts. The ultimate goal 
of this study, admittedly some
what ambitious but perhaps not 
improbable, is to teach the 
computer to become a more ac, 
curate decision maker than the 
experts who were originally pro
grammed. Dr.. Kleinmuntz belives that this is a realistic goal 
because the computer, once it is ; 
properly programmed, does not | 
make the types of careless errors ] 
to which we humans are fre
quently prone. Also he believes 
that the computer can be used j 
as a tool lor mass processing of 
thousands of personality tests at 
phenomenally high speeds.
After completion of the present 
study he plans to investigate more 
subtle clinical decision making 
processes than test interpertation.
Dr. Kleinmuntz joined the fac
ility in 1959 after having served 
as clinical psychologist at the 
Mental Health Center of the Uni
versity of Nebraska.

Fifth Faculty Book Exchange, 
Trade, Circulate Used Volumes
The Welfare Committee of the 
General Faculty, with the coop
eration of Professor Fagerhaugh 
and the library staff, is pleased to 
announce the fifth annual Faculty 
Book Exchange.
On Monday, Tuesday, and Wed
nesday, May 14, 15, and 16, fac
ulty members are requested to de
posit in the Processing Depart
ment near the administrative of
fices of the Hunt Library, books 
which are no longer useful to 
them. All kinds of books will be
welcomed, but each should be in 
good condition.
On Thursday and Friday, May 
17 and 18, faculty members are 
invited to visit the Hunt Library 
to select books from those ac
cumulated earlier in the week. 
You need not contribute books in 
order to make choices, and there 
is no limit on the number which 
you may remove from the shelves 
marked, Faculty * Book Ex
change.
On Satux-day May 19 and Mon
day May 21 students and other
Carnegie Tech personnel will be 
permitted to take any remaining 
books. Those left on the shelves 
after'Monday will be given to the 
library for its disposal.
The Welfare Committee hopes 
that the General Faculty will con
tinue to support and appreciate 
the Book Exchange. Last year 115 
faculty members contributed 350 
volumes, of which 170 were taken 
by faculty and 152 by students. 
Your cooperation will be greatly 
appreciated in this years ex
exchange.

Now Is Time To

Regardlesso
(ACP)College is the time to 
test ideas, writes an editorialist 
&jn the UNIVERSITY DAILY 
"KANSAN. But in politics and cur
rent events, especially, students 
are damned if they do and damn
ed if they dont.
He continues:
Those who promote or voice 
favor for liberal issues usually 
are labeled as pinks or comsymps. Students who favor con
servative viewpoints are just as 
quickly labeled reactionaries or 
pseudo facists.
The vast majority of students 
belong to the group which favors 
neither of these outlooks and be
ing less full of fire and zeal they 
dont reach the public eye as 
wierdos. But even this group 
comes under the gun. They are 
cussed and discussed for apathy.
The only way to avoid getting 
stuck with such names is to swal
low everything that is put out by 
professors or government leaders 
^fnd nod heads in violent agree
ment.
Our knowledgeable elders over
look one important point: the
United States is not such a fragile 
institution that it cannot stand the 
question of even the most radical

Cut Apron Strings, Promote 
Full University Press Freedom
(ACP)University administra
tions should cut the apron strings 
as far as fredom of the campus 
press is concerned, says the Xavier 
University NEWS.
What is freedom of the press? 
j Is it not the right to print per
sonal and controversial opinion? 
Is it not the right to print that 
opinion whether it is right or 
wrong? If not, then what is it?
Should a university have free
dom of the press? If true freedom 
exists, some opinions contrary to 
the alumni, faculty, administra
tion, or student opinion will be 
printed. Somebody is going to be 
embarrassed or upset. Does this 
mean a university should not have 
freedom of the press?
Can students accept the respon
sibility that is required by free
dom of the press? A chief aim of 
the university is to instill respon
sibility. How can we produce re
sponsible leaders if we do not 
give them responsibilities as stu
dents? The student by expressing 
freedom can learn the difference 
between imprudence and impu
dence. If he cannot be imprudent 
in an atmosphere of guidance, 
j then what cours will his later 
imprudence take? If the univer
sity is to be mater et magistra.
then she must cut the apron 
strings of the mater, and let the 
magistra begin.
Is it necessary for a student 
newspaper to represent the views 
of the student majority? If ma
jority opinion is all that is to be 
expressed, do away with newsmen 
and politicians andb ring in the 
sociologists to take polls. Is it 
not part of the responsibility and 
reward of newsmen to give wellinformed views? Surely if they 
compile the stories, they should 
have the experience and reward 
of expresing their views.
Whether a school is large or 
1 small depends not on its num
bers, but on the amount of re
sponsibility it entrusts to its stu
dents.

Pershing Rifles Elect Officers; High Spirits Promote Production
Dobras Assumes Command
?
Election of officers from within the ranks has been a 
tradition in small, independently organized militarj^ units 
within this country since colonial times. Perishing Rifles 
Company A-5 has recently carried on in this tradition and 
announces the following officers for 1962-63: PR Captain 
Victor Dobras takes command of the company from Jack 
Wilson. The commanders job is to be responsible for the 
general running of the unit. PR First Lieutenant Don Foulk 
replaces Stan Doran as Executive Officer. The Exec handles 
iinances and aids the commander 
in the performance of his duties.*
PR Second Lieutenant Dave
Blocher succeeds Chuck Raqet 
(this years ROTC Regimental 
Colonel) as S-l, Administration 
Officer. Warrent Officer Rich Da
vis takes over the S-2, Public In
formation, section from Don 
Foulk. The S-2 handles monthly 
reports to the Military Depart
ment in AH, spongers the PR 
Queen Contest and the Winter 
Dance in January and is in 
charge of newspaper and bulletin 
board publicity. Vic Dobras hands 
over his position as S-3, Opera
tions and Training Officer, to PR 
First Lieutenant Steve Blue. Mr. 
Blue will plan next falls pledge 
training, the annual Hell Week
end in December, and tactical
manuevers in Schenley Park. The 
Supply Officer, S-4, supplies am
munition and food for Hell Week
end, refreshments at the Winter 
Dance, and all other supplies 
needed by the company. This 
position is taken over by PR 
Second Lieutenant Mike Ingram, 
replacing Nilo Niccolai (this 
years First Battalion Comman
der). The final person elected is 
First Sergeant Jack Pevenstein.
Captain Dobras and Lieutenant 
Foulk will be the only seniors in 
the company next year. Lieuten
ants Blocher, Blue, and Ingram 
will be juniors, and W. O. Davis 
and Sergeant Pevenstein are 
among next year's sophomore 
members.

Vital Campus Security Program Expands, 
Endeavors to Give Techites Maximum Safety
For the past few months, there 
have been questions to the Tartan 
regarding the influx of agency 
policemen on the Tech campus. To 
answer these queries, we went to 
I* the head of the security program 
at Tech, Mr. Wm. Dwayne Young. 
The security program was esta
blished this past October in hopes 
of reducing the complaints both 
by Tech people and outsiders. Un
known to the general student 
body, a security force is needed 
to protect students and faculty 
from infractions caused by outsid
ers. A few weeks ago a motorcycle 
was stolen from a student by 
someone not connected with this 
campus. That same night, through 
the combined efforts of the CIT 
officers and agency and Pittsburgh 
Police, the thief was apprehended, 
and the motorcycle restored to its 
rightful owner.
The security program does not 
intend to replace CIT officers with 
agency detectives. The regular CIT 
security officers are and will con
tinue to be used, with our regular 
staff being supplemented by the 
agency. Together, they create an 
integrated force which is controll
ed by the Security Office. The aim 
of this office is to provide Pre
ventive Policing, and thereby act 
as a .deterrant. The reduction in 
complaints since October has 
proven that such an integrated 
system is effective.
There are fixed and defined
needs for guards. Scheduling will 
be derived from these fixed needs 
of the campus as time goes on and 
the security office will supplement 
peak loads at its own discretion. 
It is this closely integrated opera
tion that makes the number of 
men of campus seem increased. 
There are really fewer men and 
fewer hours worked by them. By 
utilization and proper scheduling, 
Mr. Youngs Office has been able 
to provide proper coverage on the 
Tech campus, and thereby seem 
to increase the number of guards. 
Economic findings will bear great
ly on the decision as to when to 
use what service and what men.
The aim of his office has been 
summed up by Mr. Young: 
Whether it be CIT security offi
cers or an agency, by proper 
scheduling and an integrated op
eration, the intent of the security 
coverage is to afford protection 
for CIT faculty staff and students. 
The intention is not to supervise 
the students but to be of service 
to them by being both protective 
and helpful. These are the de
fined duties of CIT security and 
at any time special events arise 
such as Spring Carnival every ef
fort shall be put forth to make it 
a success.
Most of us realize the stagger
ing amount of pilfering that is 
done in the bookstore and the li
brary by our own people. The
mirrors in the bookstore have re
lieved the situation there some
what, but it is still necessary for 
a guard to patrol. The bookstore 
is a non-profit concern which op
erates on a cost inventory basis. 
Each act of pilfering increases the 
cost of books and supplies. Who 
are the thieves hurting but them
selves and the rest of the student 
body and faculty who frequent the 
bookstore? Again Mr. Youngs 
security officers are helping the 
Tech people. Why should we pay 
higher prices because John Doe 
walks off with a book?
The security office is doing a 
good job and should receive all 
the assistance possible of the Tech 
faculty, staff, and student body.But then silence would be just as uniform!*

FBI Director Advocates 
Tougher Stand On Communism
Editors Note:
Last week the TARTAN print
ed two articles concerning Com
munist gains in the U.S. The FBI 
answers this problem.
By J. EDGAR HOOVER 
Director, Federal Bureau of 
Investigation .
During our generation, a new 
menace  international commu
nismhas arisen to threaten free
men throughout the world. Act
ually, there is little basic differ
ence between the fascism of Adolf 
Hitler and the atheistic tyranny 
practiced behind the Iron Curtain. 
The Soviet Union and her satel
lites are a godless dictatorship 
ruled by warped and twisted 
minds.
We are at war with the Com
munists and the sooner every redblooded American realizes this the 
safer we will be. Naturally, we 
want to live in peace, but we do 
not want peace at any pricewe 
want peace with honor and integ
rity. And we intend to assure it 
for the future.
The extent of the menace posed 
by the philosophy of communism 
is clear-cut and obvious. However, 
it is absolutely necessary that we 
attack and oppose it calmly, ra
tionally, and objectively.
We must continue to stiffen our 
national backbone in dealing with 
the Communists and their dupes, 
sympathizers, and apologists. If 
we relax our guard for one mo
ment, we court national disaster.
Party Active in U.S.
The atheistic Communist dicta
torship now controls one-fourth of 
the earths surface and more than 
one-third of her peoples. The 
Communist threat from without 
must not blind us to the Commu
nist threat from within. The lat
ter is reaching into the very heart 
of America through its espion
age agents and a cunning, defiant, 
and lawless Communist Party, 
which is fanatically dedicated to 
the Marxist cause of world en
slavement and destruction of the 
foundations of our Republic.
The Communist Party in this 
country has attempted to infiltrate 
and subvert every segment of our 
society. The partys efforts have 
been thwarted in this country by 
the Governments internal secur
ity program, by investigation, ar
rest, and prosecution of party 
functionaries, and by widespread 
intelligent public opposition to the 
Communist philosophy.
Recently, the Communist Party

NO PRESCRIPTION NEEDED
in the United States deliberately 
and flagrantly refused to comply 
with the U. S. Supreme Court de
cision which requires it to register 
as an agent of the Soviet Union 
with the Attorney General. 
Thereby, it once again has form
ally declared itself to be a lawless 
organization. No longer can its 
members falsely profess that the 
party is a legitimate political or
ganization. Nor can its sympathiz
ers and fellow travelers feign in
nocence of the true nature of the 
un-American conspiracy which 
they support.
Unfortunately, we are plagued 
with some Soviet apologists who, 
time after time, would have us 
betray the cause of international 
freedom and justice by yielding to 
the Red Fascists in the Kremlin 
on vital moral issues.
We also have in our midst some 
timid souls who have so little 
faith in the strength of democracy 
that they would have our country 
yield to. international threats and 
intimidation. I include those per
sons who urge appeasement at 
any price and those who chant 
the better Red than dead slogan.
Americas emblem is the soaring 
eaglenot the blind and timid 
mole. Fear, apologies, defeatism,
andc owardice are alien to the 
thinking of true Americans. As 
for me( I would rather be dead 
than Red.
America does not have to apolo
gize to anyone. Certainly not to 
the arrogant, shoe-pounding 
Khrushchev and his puppetsnor 
to those neutrals whose neutrality 
is but an evidence of moral weak
ness. We should keep our heads 
up looking for honorable solutions 
and selling America, rather than 
keep our heads down looking for 
shelters and the compromise of 
human rights.
Appersement No Answer
Those who follow the road of 
appeasement do not know the 
true meaning of freedom. They 
do not comprehend the misery of 
Communist enslavement. You will 
not find their cheap slogans on the 
lips of the Hungarian refugees, 
the East German patriots, nor 
other freedom-loving peoples who 
have escaped from behind the 
Iron Curtain.
Nor do you find their apologies 
in the writings of great American 
patriots such as: Patrick Henry, 
who asked the searching question, 
Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, 
as to be purchased at the price of 
chains and slavery?; or Benja
min Franklin, who declared, 
They that can give up essential 
liberty to obtain a little tempor
ary safety deserve neither liberty 
nor safety; or Samuel Adams, 
who reminded us that The lib
erties of our country v * * are 
worth defending at all hazards; 
and it is our duty to defend them 
against all atacks. We have re
ceived them as a fair inheritance 
from our worthy ancestors * * * 
who purchased them for us with 
toil and danger.
In the fight to preserve our Re
public, it is not enough merely 
to be against crime, crime subver
sion, or against any of the other 
enemies which weaken the Na
tions strength from within. To 
stand for the American ideal, to 
work for the cause of liberty and 
justicethese give true meaning 
til ife in this great Republic.
If we are to effectively resist 
the eroding influence of commu
nism, it is imperative that all citi
zens of this Nation exhibit in more 
positive ways the value and su
periority of our form of govern
ment over any foreign ideology.
Let us also work for a revolu
tiona revolution by the spirit, 
not by the sword. Let there be 
vital forces at work in our society 
and not merely slogans. Let us 
be for America all the way; but, 
at the same time, let us not be 
taken in by those who promote 
hysteria by the distortion and mis
representation of the true facts 
whether they be the proponents
of chauvinism of the extreme 
right or pseudoliberalism of the 
extreme left.
At another hour of grim chal
lenge a full century ago, Abra
ham Lincoln urged the American 
people,  Let us have faith that 
right makes might, and in that 
faith let us to the end dare to do 
our duty as we understand it.
We are living in an age of un
certainlyan age of awesome na
tional peril  an age when the 
struggle between freedom and 
totalitarian enslavement is draw
ing toward a climax. We now 
have need of faith as never before 
in our Nations history. We must 
revive within ourselves the faith 
of our forefathers, which enabled 
them to meet and overcome ad
versity.
Our Nation holds in trust the 
last hope of a free civilization. 
Our dedication to truth, justice, 
and individual dignity must not 
be compromised. If we are strong 
enough, and care enough, and 
maintain our national integrity, 
this Nation will survive the ter
rible threat that presents itself 
today. With Gods help, we will 
meet the challenge of survival. 
This is the heritage of America.
Director J. Edward Hoover first 
expressed these views in accepting the Mutual of Omaha Criss 
Award for 1961, given to him by 
a distinguished board of judges 
for his selfless devotion and con
tributions to the safety and secur
ity of the American People over a 
period of more than four decades.

Wednesday. May . 1962  THE CARNEGIE TARTAN  Page 11
Plagued by lack of depth 
and injuries, the CIT track 
squad dropped two meets dur
ing the past week, losing to 
Geneva, 75 to 56, and to Alle
gheny, 70% to 6OV2. This low
ered the Tech record to 4 wins 
and 3 losses with the 3 losses 
coming in the last three meets.
The major problem that has be
gun to hurt the team is the usual 
one in Tech sports; lack of depth. 
In both the Geneva and Allegheny 
meets, Tech managed to take 
more first places than the oppo
sition, only to be swamped in sec
onds and thirds. The solution to 
this problem has coach Bill Hinchberger mystified, and there is no 
answer in sight. With the WPG' 
meet coming up in one and onehalf weeks, a crash program has 
been put into effect to strengthen 
the reserve material.
Injuries have also hurt Tech in 
depleting frontline material. Rick 
Rogers, low-hurdler, has missed 
three meets with a pulled mus
cle, and the effects of his absence 
are all too obvious. Dave Grebos 
is still out with an ankle injury 
suffered in the first meet, cutting 
down Techs chances in the pole 
vault. Ben Pontano, second man in 
the 440, has missed two meets be
cause of an injured leg.
The story of the Geneva meet 
1 can be told with no difficulty. 
Geneva swept the 440, Javelin, 
and both hurdles to take 36 points 
to none for Tech, giving the Tar
tans an unsurmountable obstacle. 
The best Tech performances were 
turned in by Dennis Gary, with 
wins in the 100 and 220, and Tony 
Williams, victor in both pole vault 
and high jump.
In the Allegheny meet, Tech 
was in contention down to the 
last event, the broad jump. With 
the score 62% to 59x/2 in favor 
of Allegheny. Tech figured to 
take enough points with freshmen 
Bob Diskin and Ron Kurdra to 
edge out the Gators. However, Ed
wards and Tulloch of Allegheny 
both cleared 21 to cop first and
second, wishing away all hopes 
for a victory.
Dennis Gary turned in two 
beautiful performances in his spe
cialties, the 100 and 220. Gary, 
with the aid of a slight wind and 
a straightaway 220 track, came 
away with a blistering time of 
21.1, one of the best in the area 
this year. He also hit 9.9 in the 
100, another very good time.
Mike Campbell, expected to be 
given stiff competition by Benz 
of Allegheny, took a sneak and 
ran away from the field in the 
two-mile run, winning easily. 
Andy Niedra switched from tfcrg 
880 to the 440 for the meet and 
emerged victorious with a fine 
time of 51.0. Tom Terpack, run
ning for the first time in five 
meets because of a sprained ankle, 
managed to, limp home for a third 
in the 440. With Terpack again 
available for 440 chores, Niedra 
can - return to his quest of the 
school 880 record.
Tony Wililams cleared his usual 
12 feet to capture the pole vault, 
and finished second in his high 
jump to wrap up a good day. The 
inability of Techs best high jump
er, Jim Sharkey, to clear 5 8 in 
the last two meets has been dis
tressing. It is hoped that Sharkey 
will be back in his usual winning 
form before long.
Jon Borofsky captured the shot 
with no difficulty, and, Hank Wer
ronen took first in the discus. 
Borofsky and Werronen have 
proved to be highly dependable 
performers in the weights for 
Tech.

IM Softball In Full SwingOneThird Of Games Played
Now that spring is here, intra
mural softball is being played at 
the rapid pace of six games per 
night. With the leagues in only 
their second week of play, as of 
May 3, one or two leaders in each 
league are already beginning to 
pull ahead of the pack. From the 
scores and other statistics it is: 
evident that offense is being 
stressed much more than the past 
week. The winning team scored 
less than ten runs only six times. 
ATO A took the lowest scoring 
game of the season with a 4-3 win 
over Dunkers in the Pirate league, 
to boost ATO into the number 
three slot, only a half game off the 
pace.

IM Coif Opens - 4 Teams Ably Manned
The intramural golf season has 
begun with five teams participat
ing in this, its third year as part 
of the IM program. With this 
springs unusually fine weather as 
a contributing factor, the calibre 
of IM golf has noticeably im
proved over that of the past few 
years.
The defending champion Vulcans must be rated highly since 
they have lost but one man from 
last years fine team. The ATOs, 
however, have fielded a very pow
erful entry in their bid to recap
ture the crown they won two 
years ago. It is probable that these 
two strong, well-balanced teams 
are once again the cream of the 
crop, and will battle it out for 
the title for the third straight year.
Either SN or DTD could quite 
possibly pull an upset, but it ap
pears that these two darkhorse 
entries lack the depth of the frontrunners and will vie for third
place in the league. Vulcan B 
seems to have fifth (and last) 
place all to themselves. Compared 
to the other four teams, about all
that can be said for this team is 
that they will hit the ball; un
fortunately, they will probably do 
this far too often.
Westminster Stops Tech Golfers
After three consecutive victories, 
the Tartan golfers lost three 
matches to a tough Westminster 
team. It was a bad day for Tech; 
the squad as a whole did poorly on 
the unfamiliar course. The only 
winner for Tech was newcomer 
Dave Kelso. Neil DeRito salvaged 
Vz -point with a tie, but Roy Ging
ery, Pete Beatmann, Tom Roberts, 
and Jim Barr were shut out. 
Westminster also took the point 
for medalist, giving them the edge5% - iy2.
Led by meadlist Neil DeRito, 
the veteran squad of coach Bill 
Rogers easily won its first two 
matches, defeating Waynesburg 
6-1 and Duquesne 5-2. In the 
third a non-conference match,
Tech won a close one beating 
Washington and Jefferson 3^
