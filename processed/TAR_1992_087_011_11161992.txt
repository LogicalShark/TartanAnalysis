At the Student Senate meeting 
Tuesday night, questions arose 
concerning the absence of cur
rent Student Government Presi
dent Natalie Gesmond. Due to 
the effects of a chronic illness, 
Gesmond has been unable to at
tend recent Student Government 
meetings. Yet, contrary to rumor, 
Gesmond will continue to fulfill 
her duties as Student Govern
ment president.
Senators expressed confusion 
regardingthe role ofErik Larson, 
Student Government chief of 
staff, who gave the presidents
report at the Senate meeting, 
announcing that he will act as 
Gesmonds voice. Larsonsresponsibilities concerning Student Gov
ernment will remain unchanged, 
and because he is directly under 
Gesmond in the Student Govern
ment hierarchy, he will function, 
in his words, as Gesmonds eyes 
and ears and voice. In other 
words, Larson will relate the 
events of the Student Govern
ment meetings to Gesmond and 
relay Gesmonds responses and 
decisions to Student Government.
Although this appears to be a 
significant setback to an outside 
observer, Gesmond emphasizes, 
that she will accomplish all she
set out to do last spring when she 
took office. Specifically, she will 
not ignore the projects which have 
been initiated since the begin
ning of her term.
On the whole, Student Govern
ment, including Gesmonds role 
in it, will not be affected by her 
physical absence.
My biggest concern is that stu
dent organizations won't be able 
to talk directly to me at Student 
Government meetings,Gesmond 
said.
However, Gesmond also said 
that any representative of a stu
dent organization who has a con
cern should feel free to contact 
her or Larson.

WRCT wins legal battle
By KEEGAN FOLK
Tartan Staffwriter
WRCT, CMUs student-operated radio station, 
Has received permission from the Federal Commu
nications Commission (FCC) to expand its broad
cast power and range after a three-year series of 
attempts.
The terms of the agreement with the FCC re
quire WRCT to purchase a directional antenna 
that will limit its broadcast power to the east, but 
boost the power to the north, south, and west. With 
the power boost, WRCT will be able to reach nearly 
a million listeners, a 300 percent increase in audience size, with the broadcast reaching to Neville 
Island in the west, Monroeville in the east, halfway 
to Mars [Penn] in the north, and to all of the South 
Hills suburbs, according to Steve Auterman, 
WRCTs business manager and a fifth year archi
tecture major.
The story of WRCTs quest to boost its power is a 
long and frustrating one. In the summer of 1989, 
WRCT filed an application with the FCC to in
crease the stations power from 100 watts to 1500 
watts, which would increase the stations broad
cast area to an eightto ten-mile radius from its 
current radius of approximately three miles. AcPlease see WRCT, page 5Student body president ill

THE TARTAN
discrimination allegation
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Staffwriter
A former student in the Drama 
Department, Dick Scanlan, 
charged last week that the de
partment has a policy of discrimi
nating against gay men and over
weight women. As a result of 
Scanlans article, the Office of 
Student Affairs is asking anyone 
who feels there is homophobia in
the department to come forward. 
Michael Murphy, dean of Stu
dent Affairs, says a letter is being 
sent out to members of the drama 
community at Carnegie Mellon 
asking them to come forward if 
they feel that they have been 
treated unfairly.
Scanlans allegations were pub
lished last week in a feature story 
in TheaterWeek magazine. 
Scanlan says that students who
were gay or overweight were cut 
unfairly from the drama program.
Provost [Paul] Christiano is 
sending a letter to students, fac
ulty, and staff, so that people will 
be aware of what the avenue is 
voicing their concerns. It is an 
invitation for anyone to come for
ward who feels that they have 
been treated unfairly, says 
Murphy.

Senate 
elections 
take place

There may be surprises in store for student 
organizations at Tuesdays fall budget hearings. A 
drop in enrollment will force Student Senate to cut 
subsidies to fall budget student organizations. In 
addition, there will be a retroactive budget cut in 
the works for all spring budget organizations. The 
budget cut would reduce the amount of money the 
organizations are allowed to spend this year.
All organizations funded by Senate through the 
Student Activities Fee are classified as either fall 
or spring budget organizations. Fall budget orga
nizations are subsidized from the day after Senate 
approves their budget and June 30, the end of 
CMUs fiscal year. Spring budget organizations 
are subsidized from the July 1 after Senate ap
proves their budget until the end of the fiscal year. 
Fall budget organizations receive 10 percont of 
their previous years allocation to uso until their 
budgets are approved.
Senator Michael Loomis, chair of the Funding 
and Recognition Committee (F&R), snys that ap
proximately 500 fewer students nre enrolled for 
the fall semester than was predicted. It was my 
assumption that wed have more money than wo 
ended up with," Loomis said, I felt that we'd have 
$50,000 more than what it turns out we have.
The fall budgets proposed by student organiza
tions for next year call for $132,085 in Senate 
subsidies. Student Senate has about $123,000 to 
spend.
Loomis said that one or two organizations that 
really went over subsidy will bo treated a little 
harshly. He indicated that it would be between 6 
and 10 percent.
We are considering a retroactive across the 
board budget cut [of the spring budgets], said

Senate 
proposes 
budget cuts

Last Monday and Tuesday, Student Senate elec
tions took place in front of Doherty Hall. Approxi
mately 350 votes were cast, which represents about 
six percent of the student body.
Senator Shawn Knight (MCS), chair of Senates 
Public Relations committee, explained that there 
was a possibility that the Senate elections would be 
postponed to last Tuesday and Wednesday, due to 
a lack of Elections Board members to staff the polls 
on Monday. Knight says that members of Student 
Senates Elections Board must be present at the 
voting table.
On Monday morning, only one member was able 
to be contacted, who was sick at the time. Knight 
attempted to postpone the elections until the next 
day, but Tom Strong, staff member at the Pitts
burgh Supercomputing Center and a former Sena
tor, referred to the bylaws stating that once elec
tion days have been established, they cannot be 
changed by any member of Student Senate.
However, this postponement of the elections vio
lated the student body constitution. Article 4, sec
tion 1, subsection A of the consititution states, 
Student Senate must establish and announce the 
Fall election date by the final day of September.... 
As a result, elections occurred as planned on Mon
day and Tuesday.
During the elections, there was a question of the 
validity of two candidates. In order to run for 
Student Senate, the candidate must be have paid 
the Activities Fee.
Paul Sollimo, a candidate from CFA, and Michel 
Robe, a candidate from GSIA, were not on the list 
of Activities Fee-paying students at the elections. 
Both Sollimo and Robe were unaware of this fact at 
that time.

THIS JUST IN,..
Conservatives emerge as 
GOP Senate leadership
WASHINGTON November 11 (DJ)  Conser
vatives held tight to the Senate Republican lead
ership in a series of races that furthered the 
Presidential ambitions of Texas Senator Phil 
Gramm but could drive party moderates closer 
to the coming Clinton administration, The Wall 
Street Journal reported.
Minority Leader Robert Dole retained his post 
without challenge, but the remaining caucus 
elections underscored the gap between the Kan
sas veteran and a younger set of ambitious con
servatives whose personal relationships were 
forged in the House in the first years of the 
Reagan administration.
Gramm, who will remain chairman of the Sen
ate Republican campaign committee, is the most 
prominent of this generation. He will be joined in 
the leadershipby Mississippi SenatorTrentLott, 
a former House whip who won a lesser post in the 
Senate hierarchy. Neither man is a natural ally 
for Dole. The minority leader was widely counted 
as supporting Kentucky Senator Mitch 
McConnell, wholost20-19in abid to oustGramm.
AH sides pledged to work together, but the 
internal party conflicts pose a major challenge 
for the leadership in the coming Congress. Doles 
harsh rhetoric in recent days reflects pressure on 
him to confront the new Democratic President. 
Yet this course runs counter to his own instincts 
as an experienced legislator and risks alienating 
moderates who no longer will be bound to the 
Republican side by their loyalty to President 
Bush.
The moderate faction effectively was shut out 
in the races yesterday. And with the exception of 
Dole, the entire GOP leadership will now be from 
the South and West. The same regions are .home 
to many in a conservative rump bloc dubbed the 
214 Group for the room number of its meeting 
place in Vice President Dan Quayles chambers 
off the Senate floor.
This faction yesterday helped to engineer a 
calculated, albeit unsuccessful, challenge to Mi
nority Whip Alan Simpson, Doles second-incommand. It draws on a set of personal alliances 
among former House members who favor a more 
aggressive tactical style nurtured from their years 
in the minority there.
Even among this group, Gramms Presidential 
ambitions are viewed warily. But he was helped 
yesterday by his ties to Texas and pro-Israel 
interests that have made him a valuable fund
raiser for a party that no longer will have a 
President in the White House. The post gives him 
a platform looking toward 1996, although the 
narrowness of the vote testifies to concern about 
his past performance and brusque style, which 
rankles colleagues.
His manner is a striking contrast with that of 
Senator JohnBreaux ofLouisiana, whois emerg
ing in Democratic Party ranks.
The two men were Democratic Boll Weevil 
allies in the House in the early Reagan years, but 
while Gramm moved to the GOP, Breaux moved 
up through the moderate Democratic Leader
ship Conference so aligned with fellow southerner 
Bill Clinton.
Without opposition, Breaux won election yes
terday to the deputy whip position in the Demo
cratic leadership. Together with Arkansas Sena
tor David Pryor, the third ranking Democrat in 
the leadership, Breaux will be a natural ally for 
Clinton. His Southern ties could be important if 
legislative battles break out on regional lines.
Among higher-ranking Democrats, Majority 
Leader George Mitchell of Maine and Kentucky 
Senator Wendell Ford, the second-in-command, 
won election without opposition. Virginia Sena
tor Charles Robb will remain chairman of the 
Senate Democratic campaign committee at least 
through the two remaining Senate races in Geor
gia and North Dakota. But Mitchell is expected 
to make a new appointment next year.
Among those believed under consideration are 
Sens. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Bar
bara Mikulski of Maryland.
U.S. Attorney investigates 
handling of student loans
NE W Y ORK, N o vember 12 (D J) 
 A Citibank unit that handles 
government-guaranteed student 
loans is beinginvestigated by fed
eral authorities for allegedly fal
sifying claims on delinquencies, 
according to a regulatory filing, 
The Wall Street Journal reported.
The criminal investigation by 
the U.S. Attorney for the West
ern District of New Y ork began in 
1991 afterthe Citibank unit,Stu
dent Loan Corp., told authorities 
that one of its employees had 
forged documents that overstated 
attempts to reach delinquent bor
rowers. The false claims resulted 
in the unit receiving a $500,000 
reimbursement from agencies 
that guarantee the loans. The 
employees motives were unclear. 
The money was repaid by Stu
dent Loan Corp.
The investigation, which is con
tinuing, centers on whether the 
unnamed employee acted alone 
or was part of a broader, system
atic scheme to defraud the gov
ernment, law enforcement offi
cials say. The employee and 
Citibank, the principal unit of
Citicorp, are aiding in the inves
tigation, authorities said.
In the guaranteed student loan 
program sponsored by the De
partment of Education, delin
quent loans are reimbursed to 
banks if documented attempts 
have been made to track down 
deadbeat borrowers. The depart
ment has detailed rules on what 
a lender must do to receive reim
bursements for student loans, 
such as requiring at least four 
phone calls and a synopsis of each 
call. A Department of Education 
official said the agency has found 
occasional instances of misrep
resentation of the due diligence 
required to obtain the guarantee 
payments.
Student Loan Corp., based in 
Pittsford, N.Y., is the largest origi
nator of guaranteed student loans 
in the country, and among the 
largest holders and servicers of 
loans. It recently filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Com
mission (SEC) to sell an 18 per
cent stake in the company as part 
of Citicorps capital-raising effort.
The investigation was disclosed
in the filing with the SEC. Den
nis C. Vacco, the U.S. Attorney 
for the Western District, con
firmed the investigation of the 
unit and declined to comment 
further.
Student Loan Corp. said it  
doesnt expect further liability 
from the incident or any material 
adverse effect due to the investi
gation.
In August the Student Loan 
Marketing Association, the largest holder of student loans and 
the second-largest originator, 
saidit had offered to buy Citicorps 
$3.2 billion portfolio pf student 
loans and related servicing op
erations.
In the nine months ended Sep
tember 30, the Citicorp unit 
earned $35.2 million, up from 
$18.4 million a year earlier.
This isnt the first time the 
banking giant has found employ
ees overstating revenue.
Last year Citicorp dismissed 
senior executives in its credit card 
processing unit after they over
stated the units revenue by 
around $22 million.
President dismisses high 
state department official
Supreme Court refuses to 
hear drug-testing lawsuit
WASHINGTON, November 10 (AP)President 
Bush today dismissed the State Department offi
cial involved in the pre-election search of the pass
port and citizenship files of Bill Clinton.
Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Tamposi, 
a former Republican fund-raiser, was given until 
tomorrow afternoon to clear out her office, State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher an
nounced.
Boucher said Bush acted after conferring this
morning with Acting Secretary of State Lawrence now.
S. Eagleburger.
He declined to assert that Tamposi had engaged 
in any wrongdoing, saying only that Bush accepted 
Tamposis resignation, which was submitted along 
with those of all other Presidential appointees as 
part of the transition to the Clinton administra-. 
tion.
Boucher said additional details will be made  
available once a report by the State Department 
inspector general is completed a few days from
Supreme Court lays down decisions
WASHINGTON, November 9 
(AP)  The Suprome Court re
fused to revive an invasion-ofprivacy lawsuit; against an auto 
parts plant in Michigan that re
quired all its employees to un
dergo drug testing.
The court, without comment, 
rejected an appeal by a group of 
former employees who said plant 
managers had not linked any ac
cidents or disciplinary problems 
to drug use.
The plant in Kalkaska, Mich.,
owned by Eagle-Picher Industries 
Inc. (EPI) said in July 1989 it 
would begin a drug-testing pro
gram after an undercover police 
agent said most of the 230 em
ployees and some supervisors 
used drugs.
The plant hired a private com
pany to collect urine samples from 
all employees in August 1989. 
Managers told the employees they 
must either undergo the test or 
quit.
A group of former employees
sued after either refusing to take 
the test or being fired after a 
positive test result.
They contended the drug tests 
invaded their privacy and vio
lated the companys disciplinary 
system, and that a division presi
dent defamed them by calling 
them drug users.
The high court in 1989 upheld 
government-required drug and 
alcohol tests for railway workers 
involved in accidents, and for 
Customs workers.
WASHINGTON, November 9 
(AP)  The Supreme Court to
day turned down the appeal of a 
Ku Klux Klan leader convicted 
and sentenced to death for the 
murder of a black man in Mobile, 
Ala., 11 years ago.
The court, without comment, 
left intact rulings that Henry F. 
Hays received a fair trial and a 
proper sentence. Hays was con
victed of the March 21, 1981, 
murder of Michael Donald.
The Supreme Court also agreed 
to decide whether Oklahoma may
impose income and motor vehicle 
taxes on Sac and Fox Indians 
who work and keep their cars on 
tribal land.
The court said it will hear the 
Oklahoma Tax Commissions ar
gument that the Indians must 
pay state taxes because many do 
not live on land the state holds in 
trust for the tribe.
The court, however, refused to 
decide whether non-tribal mem
bers who live and work on tribal 
land must pay state taxes.
The Court also set aside a rul
ing under which aliens in U.S. 
prisons may sue to force the gov
ernment to start deportation pro
ceedings against them before 
their prison terms are up.
The justices told a federal ap
peals court to dismiss the case as  
moot, or legally irrelevant, be
cause the person who sued has > 
finished serving his term.

DRAMA, from page 1
In the letter dated November 
12, Christiano calls the matter 
one of great concern to me and to 
the department.
I am writing to affirm to our 
drama students, faculty, staff, 
and alumni our commitment to 
the support and protection of the 
rights of all members of our cam
pus community, Christiano 
writes.
In particular I want to assure 
you that a clear mechanism ex
ists for bringing forward any con
cerns that you may have that the 
sexual orientation or physical 
characteristics ofindividuals may 
have played an undue role in their 
treatment on the campus, he 
writes. The letter then reprints 
the Universitys statement of as
surance and asks anyone who 
feels that the statement is being 
violated to speak to Student Af
fairs or to the Human Relations 
Commission (HRC).
Our hope is that if people have 
any concerns, they will come to 
speak with me or [SDS professor 
Dr. Otto] Davis, Murphy says. 
Davis is the head of the HRC.
Don Marinelli, associate head 
of the Drama Department, says 
that the department will cooper
ate fully if any type of an investi
gation is launched by Student 
Affairs or the HRC.
We will answer as many ques
tions as they want, Marinelli 
says. There is no shredder in the 
Drama Department.
The article raises interesting 
points, says Scott Safier, a mem
ber of CMUs Association of Les
bian, Gay, and Bisexual Employ
ees. I have every reason to be
lieve theyre valid.
There is a general homophobic 
attitude in drama, Safier says. 
Whether or not its in their grades 
is not the issue.
Marinelli feels the articles fo
cus was unclear. I know I had to 
go through it a few times to get a 
list of the points that were made,
Marinelli says. It was clear and 
obvious that there was a great 
feeling of hurt and anger on the 
part of Dick Scanlan. It was diffi
cult, going through the article, to
separate what he was sayingtook
place in 1981 and what he alleges 
about the department in 1992.
Marinelli says the Drama De
partment will attempt to supply 
any information pertinent to the 
departments actions today, but 
if theyre trying to find out what 
happened in 1981,1 know I cant 
answer that. Marinelli joined the 
department in 1981.
Drama responded to Scanlans 
allegations with a letterin todays 
issue of TheaterWeek, Marinelli 
says. In addition, the department 
has been sending out this official 
response to members of the news 
media that have called.
We believe that its CMUs job 
to train people to set. CMU 
shouldnt be passing judgements 
as to whos too gay to be hired and 
whos not. There are the objective 
methods of whos been a good 
student, and there are the sub
jective methods, he says. How 
much of the subjective stuff is 
making its way into the process? 
Is the cut system using criteria 
like homosexuality or weight and 
is this a fair cut system?
Safier says that some drama 
students are worried that 
Scanlans allegations will dam
age CFAs reputation.
One thing thats been dis
cussed was a fear on the part of 
the students that an investiga
tion could hurt their careers, he 
said. If theres a scandal at the 
school, the schools rating could 
go down.
Our effort is to encourage 
people to come and talk to us, so 
that theres no concern on their 
part about what the climate is 
currently, says Murphy. He 
stresses that all discussions will 
be held privately. You cannot 
overstate the importance of con
fidentiality in this matter.

WRCT receives FCC permission to boost broadcast
WRCT, from page 1
cording to FCC policy, there is a waiting period of 
six months after filing an application, during which 
other radio stations can file proposals that would 
conflict with the broadcast area of the original 
applicant. Within days of the six-month deadline, 
a group of western Maryland Christian radio sta
tions, under the name Hes Alive, Inc., filed an 
application for FM frequency 88.1 (WRCT is at 
88.3) in Murraysville that would conflict with 
WRCTs request for a power boost.
After both stations applications had been re
viewed, the FCC notified the two stations that 
their requests were mutually exclusive. In other 
words, you can have one, but you cant have both, 
said Auterman. Since the FCC cannot be biased 
toward either station in a situation like this, it was 
the beginning of a long battle.
At this point, WRCT discovered some mistakes 
in the application submitted by Hes Alive, Inc. By 
law, there cannot be certain levels of interference 
between broadcasters. Because the stations are 
geographically close and the frequencies are close,
there was a great deal of potential broadcast area 
that would overlap between the two stations. The 
Hes Alive, Inc. application did not take that fact 
into account. WRCT pointed out the mistakes and 
filed a petition with the FCC. This process was 
repeated several times, as WRCT found new mis
takes in each new application from Hes Alive.
At that point, it was looking pretty dismal for 
both of us, because if it kept on going, neither of us 
would get what we wanted, said Auterman. The 
battle had been going on for three years with no end 
in sight.
Every time WRCT submitted a petition against 
Hes Alive, Inc.s application, it cost the station 
between $600 and $1500, more if there were engi
neering problems to solve. The station spent ap
proximately $10,000 out of its regular budget over 
the course of the application/petition process. WRCT 
anticipated an FCC ruling in its favor at some 
point, because Hes Alive, Inc. had had so many 
difficulties with its application, and purchased 
(with the help of Student Senate and GSO) a 
transmitter that could broadcast at 1500 watts.
Unfortunately, the two stations were still in dead
lock.
What the FCC does in a situation like that is to 
schedule a hearing. Both parties go to court against 
each other in front of an FCC administrative law 
judge in Washington, D.C., said Auterman. The 
hearing was set for November 4 of this year. If we 
had gone to hearing, it could have easily cost us 
upwards of $20- to $30- thousand for a week or 
two, said Auterman.
WRCT decided against going to court. Instead 
they chose to change its application. The station 
found that if a directional antenna is used after the 
power is increased to 1500 watts, WRCTs broad
cast area could be directed away from the area 
where Hes Alive, Inc. wants to. broadcast. Hes 
Alive, Inc.s station is east of WRCT, in Murraysville, 
and a directional antenna aimed west would broad
cast WRCT as far, or farther, west as was originally 
intended while limiting transmitting power to the 
east. Since Hes Alive, Inc. had already agreed to 
use a directional antenna in their dispute with the 
television station, the interference problem could
finally be solved. Both stations submitted revised 
applications to the FCC judge they had been as
signed, and both applications were approved. Cur
rently, WRCT is awaiting a construction permit for 
the changes that must be made in the station and 
expect to get approved in two to four weeks.
Unfortunately, WRCTs long and expensive battle 
for a power increase is not quite over. The manage
ment and staff are fairly happy with the results of 
the compromise with Hes Alive, Inc. Howevor, the 
compromise also means buying a diroctional an
tenna that could cost $15,000 and addi tional equip
ment that could cost another $2000. To make 
matters even more difficult, a construction permit 
is only good for 18 months.
Student Senate has boon very helpful. Thoyvo 
provided us with money in the past, and to help us 
reach a settlement... [they] know this is our last 
chance to increase our power, over, said Auterman. 
Air space does not open up often because radio 
stations do not go out of business, they just change 
formats. But WRCT needs about $18,000 in the 
next 18 months, more than Senate can provide.
Schenley Park bridge closed to all traffic
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
Tartan Staffwriter
Starting today, the Schenley 
Park bridge over Boundary 
Street will be closed to all ve
hicular traffic for over one and 
a half years, according to the 
City of Pittsburghs Depart
ment of Engineering and Con
struction.
Don Killmeyer, the citys 
Bridge Division manager, said 
the bridge is being shut down 
for major rehabilitation, 
which will take up to 614 cal
endar days, or about 20 
months.
The bridge is completely 
closed to to vehicular traffic, 
but will remain open to pedes
trians and bicycles, said 
Killmeyer.
The total cost of the con
struction project is $5,213,267,
with a portion to be paid for by 
federal and state funds.
Work to be done on the bridge 
includes replacing bridge sup
port structures, repaving the 
surface, and repainting.
According to Killmeyer, the 
time it takes to complete the 
project depends largely on the 
amount of work the contrac
tor, A & L Inc. of Belle Vernon, 
completes this winter.
The bridge was supposed to 
be closed the last day of Octo
ber, said Brenda Gales, an 
employee of the citys Central 
Park Division Office. When 
people come to work on Mon
day, theyll have to find an al
ternate route.
The city has posted detour 
signs to route traffic around 
the Carnegie Museum onto 
Forbes Avenue to Schenley 
Drive.
Senate F&R Committee plans budget cuts
BUDGETS, from page 1
F&R, the number that was men
tioned was 6 3/4 percent.
We cut and cut and cut but we 
didnt cut enough, Martin said, 
we are looking at cutting further 
... [especially] some of the groups 
that went into deficit last year. 
They went over budget when we 
gave them a decent amount, and 
were going to go further.
One of the organizations that 
may feel the effects of the budget 
cuts is the University Rowing 
Club, which requested an alloca
tion of $28,135 this year, exactly 
what was allocated last year. Jay 
Laefer, Student Government 
treasurer, said that last years 
allocation was a special case.
Last years subsidy was a one 
time occurrence not to be re
peated, Laefer said. Im very 
surprised that they proposed the
budget that they did, and Im 
very surprised that F&R recom
mended it. |
As far as Im concerned, crew 
has no reason to expect to receive 
another $28,000 allocation. 
Laefer said that the year before 
last the club received consider
ably less than $28,000, and that 
Senates fiscal policy was over
ridden for crew.
Changes had been made in the 
policy regarding what activities 
of a student organization could 
be subsidized.
Laefer said Senate decided to 
override the policy, because it 
was felt that crew hadnt been 
given sufficient time to adapt to 
the new policy.
Opal Perry, president of the 
Rowing Club, said that Senate 
gave no indication that last years 
allocation was a special case.
Last year we went in with a 
subsidy request, Perry said, and 
its not to my recollection that we 
were not permitted to ask for the 
same amount of funds [this year].
The funding is necessary for 
the survival of the club, said 
Perry, our request reflects our 
needs.
Perry said that the club has 
been looking for donations from 
alumni to reduce some of the
burden that we have to place on 
Senate, but that so far, we dont 
have anything significant.
Loomis said he feels that crew 
has put a lot of effort into raising 
money from outside sources.
I think crew has taken rea
sonable steps to increase their 
fundraising, he said, and quite 
frankly, Im reluctant to punish a 
group thats made a sincere effort 
to raise money.

FORUM
Silent constituents 
suit some Senators
During the points of discussion segment of Tuesdays Student Senate meeting, Senate Chair Matt McGarvey (IM) said audience members should not speak except during the segment of the meeting specified for audience participation. McGarveys explanation was that the Student Government is a republic, not a direct democracy. Michael Tomblyn (MCS), Academic Affairs chair, agreed. Tomblyn went on to say that he does not like the caucusing at Senate meetings, when audience members go up to the table to speak privately to Senators.These comments were absolutely out of line. It is preposterous that Senate purports to represent the student body, yet some Senators do not want to hear student opinions at its public meetings.Senators can say theyre a representative body if they like, but the facts are that one-third of the Senate seats stand vacant, and even though elections were held last week, a number of seats will remain empty at the beginning of next semester. The current Senate was elected by less than 15 percent of the students.Those numbers make us question Senates true representative status. Senate does have the power to act on behalf of the student body, but saying that it is truly representative is ridiculous. Several Senators have said that students should talk to their Senators before meetings to address concerns and issues that will be discussed in Senate. Unless Senate plans to fully publicize absolutely everything that is going to go on at Senate meetings well ahead of time, this is impossible. If students dont know what is going to happen at meetings before the meetings, how can they let their Senators know their feelings about it? Excluding students who are clairvoyant, audience members need to speak at Senate meetings.Also, some students have found that their Senators cannot be trusted to bring up issues that are important to them, even if they are addressed ahead of time. In this case, students have no other recourse than to bring their concerns before the entire Senate  and the entire Senate should be willing to listen and act on those concerns.At this point, very few students seem to care about Senate and what it does. This could be attributed to the fact that some Senators seem to care very little about students and what they think. Again, it appears that this is a case of Senate wanting to do what it wants, when it wants, without anyone it supposedly represents calling it on its actions.Some individual Senators do care, and they should be outraged at the fact that other Senators, specifically the chair of Senate and the chair of Academic Affairs in this case, are making Senate as a whole look extremely bad. Now would be an excellent time for Senators who are actually interested in the students to take a stand.
Fiscal woes deserve 
intelligent solution
Because of a shortage of money from the Activities Fee, Student Senate has to make some decisions about cutting organizational budgets at the fall budget hearings Tuesday. Many organizations will be affected by any decision Senate makes, with some facing a greater deduction in their funding than others. One plan currently in discussion is retroactively cutting spring subsidies by 6.75 percent in order to make up the shortfall. This seems to unfairly penalize all the organizations that have spring budgets and have already made plans based on the approved allocations.There is another idea that Senate should consider, along the lines of freezing subsidies for spring and fall at the 91-92 levels. For every group that receives money from Senate, there should be a comparison of the 91-92 allocation and the 92-93 amount, either already approved or up for consideration. The 92- '93 allocation should be the lesser of the two amounts. While some organizations would still lose a portion of their funding, this plan makes the cuts less arbitrary, and does not penalize organizations that requested less funding this year.If there is still not enough money left, Senate should start cutting budgets based on past
fiscal behavior  organizations that consistently run over budget, for example, should be more closely examined. Also, there are a few groups that receive too much Senate funding, and should face deductions before other organizations. The Political Speakers Forum Board (PSFB) is a logical choice for cuts. It was allocated $36,000 and appears to have done very little so far this semester, while AB Lectures has done a good job of bringing in speakers.Club sports consume a large portion of the Activities Fee, and Student Senate should not be expected to continue doling out Activities Fee money to them. The University should start funding club sports immediately, like it funds intramural sports now. If this is not possible, we propose that club sports be cut based on the size of their subsidies and financial record. The Carnegie Mellon Rowing Club (crew), for example, receives a large subsidy, and has again requested funds for boathouse rental, despite previous promises not to, according to Student Government Treasurer Jay Laefer.Whatever plan is decided upon, some organizations are going to lose. Student Senate needs to be more careful in its consideration of budgets, and must dole out the Activities Fee more responsibly.
Letters to the Editor
Dramas actions raise 
discrimination questions
onEditor:
I think that there are 
shades of meaning in 
the discussion of the dhGGhP tO 
Bloody Monday afth pHi+nr 
fair that do complicate U,C 
the issues. It is, of course, perfectly obvi
ous that it should be of no particular 
concern to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
women students whether or not the 
Drama department cuts 10%, 50%, 90%, 
none, or all of each class, or whether or 
not they are motivated by crass commer
cial concerns or personal ambition in so 
doing. The question is whether or not, in 
carrying out this policy, the Department 
treats some gay men, and some women, 
with prejudice.
It is patently clear that an actor should 
be able to act, and I think that it is 
stretching things a little to claim that 
the ability to temporarily suppress or 
reproduce particular mannerisms com
mon in gay male culture should not be 
regarded as an acceptable target, inter 
alia, of acting. The question is whether 
the department treats mannerisms as
sociated with the culture of some mem
bers of one group (i.e., the campy man
nerisms of some gay men) differently 
than it would treat those of other groups 
(e.g. stereotypical mannerisms and ex
pressions of NY Jews, Americans, South
erners, African Americans, the French 
... ). Would the drama department, for 
example, attack a black student so vi
ciously for imperfect adoption of the 
mannerisms of a culturally white char
acter? Would the department cut a man 
for not being able to impersonate a 
woman with perfect fidelity?
The core of the charges brought, which 
I find hard to disbelieve, is that the 
Drama Department has singled out 
campy mannerisms for attention in a 
manner which has discriminatory effect 
against gay men, in much the same way 
in which it has (apparently admittedly) 
used purely venal criteria to select 
women with certain body types for ex
clusion.
Even if it were not the case that this 
had been done, and the Department had 
with equal enthusiasm attacked straight 
men and svelte women for not being able 
to, respectively, swish and play ample 
roles, it would be insensitive of the De
partment to show no apparent remorse 
or delicacy in asking for the suppression 
of behaviours which are, for many gay 
men, part of a gay identity which has 
been built up in the face of often brutal 
attempts at its suppression.
These are certainly questions which 
deserve serious discussion within the 
Department involved, and by the 
University community as a whole.

Pet peeves abound at CMU
Christian M. Restifo
CMU is the perfect place for pet peeves. Sol thought Id take 
this week to analyze those pet peeves unique to CMU that 
sometimes make life a royal pain. In other words, lets look at 
the gripes students have. Who knows? Maybe Mehrabian will 
listen a little bit.
Gripe the first: Physical Plant. Would someone please tell 
me if it is required for Physical Plant to do the least amount 
of work possible and to do that work at the oddest hours? Last 
winter, during finals, Physical Plant decided to work on the 
pipes in the basement of Scobell. I awoke that day to an 
incredibly loud clank as metal clashed against metal. There 
was a brief pause followed by, Gee, I wonder if that will wake 
them up. Funny, I thought people liked a quiet environment 
during finals s<ji they could study. I must be wrong.
Gripe the second: Skibo and breaks. Why must security lock 
all the doors during short breaks when a good number of 
students remain? They really seem to love locking the set of 
doors that face the parking lot on the side closer to the Cut. 
The doors by Grey Matter that face Gesling Stadium also 
appear to be fair'game. How many of you have walked all the 
way around the building looking for an open door?
Gripe the third: Them spring fix em ups. Did you ever notice 
how this campus falls to pieces during the year until events 
like Carnival, Homecoming, and Commencement? Suddenly, 
all the workers come out of hibernation. Repairs are made, 
things are cleaned up, and the look of the campus is improved. 
I hope to God that whoever does this doesnt think that its 
going to impress important people like alumni. Theyre not 
stupid. After all, they went to school here, so they know what 
the campus looks like the rest of the time.
Gripe the fourth'. Professors who run late in class. These 
people really irk me. I am more than willing to give a professor 
some extra time every now and then so that he or she may 
finish explaining a subject. When he or she consistently runs 
over, however, it really screws things up. If a good number of 
people have the same class after the current one (as do a 
number of upperclassmen), then the next class starts late. 
The cycle gets repeated. Usually, I show my discontent by
packing up at twenty after. After all, thats what the schedule 
says.
Gripe the fifth: Columnists in The Tartan. If theres one 
group worse than lawyers, it must be these weenies. Not only 
are they opinionated, but they also think that anything they 
say has to be right. As they see it, to question or argue against 
them is to show your own stupidity. Maybe they should all be 
fired... uh, wait a minute. Forget I mentioned this. Lets go on 
to something else.
Gripe the sixth: The new phone system. Every time I make 
a call with one of those cheap plastic phones, I feel as though 
Im using a Playskool phone. Im waiting for the person on the 
other line to say, My name is Cindy, and I want to be your 
friend. Can you come over and play? Grrrrr...click. When I 
hang up, I have to hang up three times and wait a few seconds.
Would someone please tell me if 
it is required for Physical Plant to 
do the least amount of work 
possible ... at the oddest hours?
If I dont, I activate some feature that connects me to a 
random room on campus. Besides, you cant slam the phone 
down when youre mad because youll smash it into a million 
pieces.
Gripe the seventh: All the cow dung that gets dumped on 
campus in the spring. I saw Physical Plant dumping some a 
while ago in front of Hammerschlag Hall. I havent taken 
biology in a while, but I seem to remember something about 
plants not growing too well in the winter.
Gripe the eighth: The mailings that get stuck in your 
mailbox. Now, I love getting mail. Ever since I was old enough 
to be put on a mailing list for an advertiser, receiving mail has 
been one the few pleasures in my life. Its rather anticlimactic when I find yet another piece of paper from the 
administration stuck in my box. I also find this to be an 
extreme waste. The next time this happens to you, go by the 
West Wing mail room and see how many of those leaflets are 
thrown about. Wouldnt it be smarter and cheaper to have 
someone put up the flyer as a poster near the mailboxes? That

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  16 November 19927
Senate takes offense at student input
Christian M. Restifo
Approximately one year ago, 
when Student Senate released 
its resolution concerning dis
crimination against gays by the 
mAmg I went ballistic. Never be
fore, I thought, have I seen such 
incompetent, clueless people 
claiming to act on behalf of the 
student body. After a large 
amount of debate and discussion, 
however, I came to know several 
of the Senators.
In general, I found most of them 
to be rational and productive 
people. Students were just too lazy 
to open their eyes and see what 
Senate was doing for them. De
spite the bad press that it some
times got, Senate made honest 
attempts at constructive goals.
All this time, Student Senate 
literally begged students to come 
to meetings and provide their in
put. Many, many times Senators 
said that they wished their con
stituents would talk to them, and 
I lost track of how often Senators 
urged people to get involved.
My already shaky faith in this 
system was crushed at the last 
Senate meeting. In four hours, I 
saw Senate deny students the 
opportunity to speak, claim that 
said students were inconveniencing them, and take several ac
tions without any clear idea of 
what they were doing.
In order to limit discussion, 
members of the audience were 
not allowed to speak during dis
cussion of the proposed bylaws 
unless their points concerned an 
amendment that had been pro
posed and was currently being 
examined. To add insult to in
jury, the few people who were 
actually at the meeting received 
a lecture from several Senators 
about how audience input during 
business slowed the whole pro
cess down. One Senator went so 
far as to suggest that members of 
the audience had so retarded the 
rate of progress that we should 
simply do away with a represen
tative form of government and 
shift to a town hall style of pure 
democracy.
Members of the audience were 
reprimanded for talking to their 
Senators. Of course, this state
ment completely disregarded the 
fact that amendments can be pro
posed and passedduringthe same 
meeting. In such a situation, the 
student body has no time to con
sult with its representatives. So 
much for representative govern
ment.
Both audience members and 
Senators were chastised for talk
ing to others while debate went 
on. As another member of the 
audience put it, what else are 
students to do when they are not
technically permitted to raise 
questions and new concerns?
In all the Student Senate meet
ings which I have attended, audi
ence attendance has been pitiful. 
In fact, I am probably one of the 
five people who show up simply 
as students and not as represen
tatives of other organizations.
make sense. This leads me to my 
next point. I doubt Senate, in its 
current state of affairs, could do 
anything sensible. For a clear 
example of why, one needs only 
to look at the change made in the 
bylaws concerning service orga
nizations.
Under the old bylaws, service
I saw Senate deny students the 
opportunity to speak, claim that said 
students were inconveniencing them, 
and take several actions without any 
clear idea of what they were doing.
Questions and arguments raised 
by the audience during business 
account for only a fraction of the 
meeting time. The rest comes 
from the Senators themselves.
Now by a strict interpretation 
of the rules, the audience can 
only speak during audience parorganizations could obtain fund
ing for certain items such as food 
that other funded organizations 
must supply on their own. Senate 
eliminated this category, the rea
soning being that it shores up 
several problem s. First, just what 
is a service organization? The
ticipation. However, the Chair of Tartan and A Phi O are definitely
Senate can recognize whomever 
he or she wants. In the past, this 
courtesy has been granted to the 
audience, and I hope it continues. 
To shorten meetings and prevent 
useless debate, however, Senate 
should look to rules that limit not 
who can speak but how many 
times a person may speak and for 
what length of time.
Of course, such a plan would
service organizations, but what 
about others? For that matter, 
what are the current service or
ganizations?
While such a move is reason
able and needed, Senate made 
this change without any idea of 
whom it would affect. Senator 
Josh Knauer put it best when, 
after the amendment had been 
passed, he asked what Senate
just did and whom would be af
fected. You can argue the merit of 
service organizations all day, but 
its clear Senate acted without 
really thinking hard about the 
issue.
Several problems now remain. 
Will the current service organi
zations on campus still be recog
nized after the bylaws are passed 
and budget hearings follow? Will 
they have to reapply for recogni
tion? How will the issue of money 
for food and other items for these 
organizations be handled? I heard 
several Senators talk about over
riding fiscal policy. Since Senate 
is already in trouble because of 
funding, such a pseudo-policy of 
simply overriding rules for each 
situation would be extremely stu
pid and dangerous.
Given the pitiful turnout that 
occurs during elections and the 
general level of apathy on this 
campus, I might argue that the 
problem lies with students and 
not with Senate. However, when 
I see Senate, with a high and 
mighty attitude, take offense at 
students providing input and act 
without even remotely under
standing the consequences, I see 
only one group to blame.

would like to thank Senators 
Knauer, DeRoss, and the few oth

during the last meeting.

Be careful the next time you go driving

you could be in for more than just a fine.
No, I havent been speeding recently, 
but after a couple of road sign warnings 
concerning speeding caught my atten
tion, I went to great lengths to discover 
exactly what they meant. What I found is 
truly shocking.
Have you ever seen the signs that say 
speed enforced by aircraft, or some
thing likethat? I called some highway 
patrol people and asked them what air
craft enforcement is all about. They 
seemed surprised, and asked Havent

things can happen:
1) Your car could be lifted up and car

location, where the helicopter will dump 
the car into a car compactor. I guess this 
isnt a big deal, but there is a frightening 
part: the arresting officers in the airoverkill in enforcing speed limits, and 
many communities agree, mostly because 
they cant afford aircraft. Signs in those 
communities tend to say Speed Electri

know what electrical enforcement is, so 
Ill tell you.

You would think that the ACLU or some 
other group would have contested these 
rather barbaric methods, but how can they 
help? The police, the FBI, and the Armed

thousands of them.
Gripe the ninth: Activities that take place during the 
day. I am dying to go to a Soup and Substance lecture. 
I just have one small problem  a class. I know we cant 
schedule these things around everyone on campus, but 
wouldnt it make sense to hold them during the free time
period? Make it a light dinner or something like that so 
that just about everyone can attend. The International 
Festival was a prime example. Last year they said that 
more events would take place in the evening. Too bad a 
majority of things started between noon and 4:00 pm. 
And they wonder why attendance is so low at events at 
CMU.
Well, those are the nine gripes that I have. There are
many more; that we all probably share, but it would take a 
whole issue of this paper to cover them. If Ive really 
depressed you, dear reader, then I apologize. Take com

Americans have had a 
lasting love-hate relationship 
with the bicycle since its 
invention long ago. Cycling has 
always had the undying sup
port of a handful of stalwart 
men and women who sang the 
praises of cardiovascular 
exercise for hours on end, all 
the while scratching their jock 
itch. But no matter how much 
they begged and pleaded, 
cycling never got the attention 
of the American people.
Until now. Here, at 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
cyclists have re-examined the 
American mind, and decided 
that in order to gain popular 
support fpr their sport, the face 
of cycling had to be changed. 
They decided that Americans 
didnt want to hear about a 
bunch of people who dressed in 
neon Spandex, hopped on their 
bikes, and pedaled around until 
they got tired.
No sir, Americans just 
werent interested in a sport 
where you didnt hit a ball, 
bash someones head, or use 
wooden sticks to whack each 
other. So cyclists at CMU took 
matters into their own hands, 
and added that spice of violence 
into their sport that we all 
know and love.
No longer would a cyclist 
cruise around campus benignly, 
yielding to pedestrians on 
sidewalks. Finish lines were 
forgotten only to be replaced by 
score cards. You no longer had 
to get from point A to point B to 
win; you had to strike as many 
pedestrians as possible. The 
cyclist who plows into the most 
pedestrians, wins.
Of course, merit points are 
awarded on the basis of injury 
inflicted to the pedestrian. For 
example, knocking the oppo
nent out of his Reeboks is 
generally more impressive than 
simply causing a massive head 
wound. Naturally, tire tracks 
across the opponents forehead 
are very rare, and therefore, 
very valuable. And if you can 
stamp BMX somewhere onto 
your opponents person, youre 
really racking up the points.
And now, the sport is 
spreading like wildfire. Cross
ing the Cut is more dangerous 
than setting up a picnic in the 
left lane of the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike. On some days, you 
can see more rubber than a 
dead skunk on 1-80. But pedes
trians and cyclists alike are 
both excited and invigorated at 
this opportunity to break up the 
monotony of walking to class 
every day. 
Already, the cycling indus
try is expanding to meet the 
growing demands for this new 
sport. Lightweight bumpers, 
seatbelts,' and day-glo infrared 
night vision goggles are being 
stocked. Though the mountain 
bike is generally considered to 
be the best choice for beginner 
cyclists; some experts are 
Pting for the ten speed, prefer
ring its agility to the mountain 
bikes plowing power.
Seeing the success that the 
revamped sport of cycling has 
made, other sports with the 
same lack of popular support 
such as swimming, golf, and 
ping-pong have begun revamp
ing their programs to allow for 
more blood. The Cross Country 
team, for example, plans to 
start carrying aluminum bats 
during practices and meets.

Alan Horn, a fifth-year senior 
sweeper and back for the mens 
soccer team, was named the 1992 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) Most Valuable Player on 
Wednesday by UAA coaches. In 
the balloting, Horn was repre
sented on seven of the nine bal
lots, giving him the nod over the 
other players. In UAA play this 
season, Horn scored two goals, 
had one assist, and allowed the 
opposition to score only a meager 
six goals in the seven games. He 
was also named to the All-UAA 
team for an unprecedented fifth 
time, for he suffered a seasonending injury early in the 1991 
season. Overall, he had eight 
points this year with three goals
and two assists.
Joining Horn on the All-UAA
Alan Horn
first team were teammates Mike 
Brazinski,a junior defender, and
junior goalie David Shapiro. 
Shapiro, who allowed only seven 
goals in 1165 minutes (0.54 aver
age), set the Carnegie Mellon 
record with 25 career shutouts 
this season, while tying Sam 
Montagues 1984 record with 10 
season shutouts. This fall, he had 
30 saves in the 15 games he played 
in before suffering a season-end
ing back injury in the game 
against Emory.
Brazinski, who only recently 
transferred to CMU from the 
University ofVirginia, was one of 
the catalysts of the team, scoring 
six goals and having two assists 
(14 points).
Coach Nick Gaudioso and his 
staff were named the coaching 
staff of the year by UAA coaches 
for their 12^4-1 record and thirdplace finish. No one was safe,
with CMU defeating Co-Cham
pions Emory University, 2-0, and

The womens soccer team, who 
had a very good showing for their

represented by sophomore de

womens team, in their first year 
of UAA conference play, posted 
an 0-6 conference record, but 
showed incredible signs of im
provement and brilliance towards 
the end of the season.

Football destroys Case Western
By JOSH LINDER
Tartan Sports Editor
In the first game of the newly created 
rivalry between Case Western Reserve 
University and Carnegie Mellon, the 
Golden Slide Rule goes to Carnegie 
Mellon with the 3314 victory.
The game, which at one point in the 
second quarter looked close, turned out 
to be a blowout for the mighty Tartans. 
The game began with Case Western 
sophomore receiver Joel Gabele return
ing the ball 49 yards, giving the Spar
tans excellent field position. Their drive, 
however, was stopped by the Tartans 
defense, and a missed field goal gave 
CMU the ball at their own 20 yard line. 
With their first drive, the Tartans drove 
the ball as far as CWRUs 46, thanks in 
large part to a 24 yard pass from sopho
more quarterback Chris Dee to junior 
wide receiver Jarrod Siket. Although 
CMU did not score on their initial drive, 
the game started to go their way begin
ning with CWRUs second drive. After 
receiving an illegal procedure penalty
that placed them at their own four 
yard line and completing a short drive, 
CWRU was stopped by junior line
backer Chad Wilson with a sack of 
junior quarterback Brett Ramsey. A 
bad snap on a punt attempt went out 
of the endzone, giving CMU two points 
on the safety. A 20 yard return by 
Blockbuster Player of the Game sopho
more Jim Filicko put CMU at their 
own 43 yard line. Shortly after, Dee 
completed a pass to junior tight end 
Scott Peters for their second touch
down connection in as many games.
The second quarter was closer than 
the Tartans would have liked. After 
CMU scored a touchdown on a Brian 
Horton run (with the extra point by 
senior kicker Fred Harding) in the 
early minutes to make the score 17-0, 
CWRU came back with a vengeance. 
A roughing the kicker call on a field 
goal attempt gave the Spartans new 
life, and allowed them to drive into the 
endzone, to tighten the score to a 17-7 
mark. A furious coach Rich Lackner 
watched his team squander the 170
lead when Case Westerns Ramsey 
completed a pass to senior split end 
Alex Nagle. Carnegie Mellon would 
not settle for a close game, so a 23 yard 
pass to Filicko quickly broke the game 
wide open, and allowed CMU to go into 
the intermission with a 24-14 lead.
The second half, however, was all 
CMU. Filicko, who had 76 yards rush
ing, 53 yards receiving, and 20 return 
yards (for a total of 149 yards), scored 
once in the second half, which put the 
game out of reach for the Spartans. A 
second sack, in the fourth period, gave 
CMU the 33-14 win, and a 3-1 UAA 
record (good for second place behind 
Rochester) and 7-2 complete record 
for the year. Case Western finished at 
2-6-1 with a 1-3 record in the UAA.
The Blockbuster Player of the Year, 
chosen by WPITs Randy Cosgrove, 
went to senior captain Matt Pielert, 
who had nine tackles in Saturdays 
game. Although it was a tough choice 
between Pielert and junior linebacker 
Chad Wilson, Pielert was the most 
and consistent.

On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon rugby club met American 
University (AU) for its final fall match. The first of the two games 
against AU this year, played in Frick Park, was dominated by a 
finely-tuned CMU squad.
CMU won almost all ofits scrums and lineouts. In the rucks and 
mauls, CMU scrummers showed a ferocity that was a key factor 
in winning the match. AUs scrum had bad transition from its 
scrum to its scrum-half and then to its fly-half.
CMU backs also proved that their skills were superior to those 
of AUs backs. Outside center, Steve Graham, was continually 
there to support his fellow backs, When he got the ball, he ran 
powerfully, often breaking numerous tackles to go the distance. 
Their backs rarely got the ball, and when they did, they almost 
never got it out past their inside center.
The first half began with AU lacking to CMU. Tartan scrummers 
drove up the field, offering continuous support for one another. 
Within 10 minutes, CMU was awarded a penalty kick about 30 
meters from AUs tryline. CMU elected to go for goal. Graham 
quickly got CMU on the board by splitting the uprights for three 
points.
Almost immediately following the kick, Graham again put 
points on the board for CMU by scoring two successive tries. The 
first began with a perfectly-timed pass from junior inside center 
Iron Mike Lopacki to Graham. He took the paBS at mid-field, 
proceeded to weave his way through the hapless AU defenders, 
and then touched it down in the tryzone for five points. The second 
try entailed Graham receiving a pass a few meters from AUs 
tryline and then running through a few AU backs for a try. 
Graham made both kicks after to put CMU ahead 17-0.
Late in the first half, senior eight-man Chris Devlin scooped up 
the ball and ran it right up AUs gut. Commenting on his run, 
Devlin said, By God, sometimes a man has to do what a man has 
to do. So, I just put my head down, said a quick little prayer, and 
ran like there was no tomorrow! Graham missed the kick after 
to make the score 22-0 at half-time.
For the remainder of the game, CMU was forced to play defense. 
After a rough maul between the two scrums, the ball got out to the 
AU backs. CMU was caught off guard as AUs inside center 
danced past several CMU hacks and into the tryzone. The kick 
was wide, leaving the final score 34-5.

The CMU swim teams both got 
off the blocks quickly this season, 
despite very opposite records. The 
mens team defeated John Carroll 
University, 116-84 on November 
7, and then edged Division II foe 
Indiana University of Pennsyl

Meanwhile, the womens team 
did well, despite dropping both 
matches with a 128-35 loss to 
IUP.
So far, were doinggreat, head 
coach Jim Cutrono said. Both 
teams are a lot faster than they
were at this point last year. Both 
have a lot more depth, too. All the 
freshmen and newcomers have 
swum well for us. The men had to 
swim very well to beat IUP. 
Theyre a tough Division II foe.
In the meet with Indiana, one 
of those freshmen, Geoff Waller, 
paved the way with three wins: 
the 200 individual medley, the 
200 butterfly, and the 400 
freestyle relay.

Saturday afternoon, the 
Carnegie Mellon hockey team 
took on league opponent Univer
sity of Pittsburgh at Johnstown 
(UPJ) in Monroeville coming off 
of an 8-3 win against Penn State 
West. CMU continued its league 
dominance by beating UPJ 
soundly and getting a large num
ber of players on the ice, as well 
as getting players who hadnt 
scored yet this season in the scor
ing column. Defense continued to 
be CMUs strong point, despite 
the fact that the team is averag
ing 8.2 points a game. They are 
only allowing 3 points per game. 
CMU leads the Western Penn
sylvania College Hockey Associa
tion with a record of 5-0.
The first period started with a 
twist. After fighting for control of 
the game for four minutes, UPJ 
scored first on graduate student 
goalie Scott Berry. UPJ fought 
for their early lead for nearly six 
minutes before graduate student
center Dave Umland scored un
assisted to tie the game. With 
less than three minutes remain
ing in the first, CMU went on a 
scoring tear. Sophomore Dan 
Kodesh scored after getting the 
puck from junior Greg Haverkamp at 14:02 to take the lead. 
Twenty-four seconds later, 
Haverkamp scored his first goal 
of the year, with the assist com
ing from Umland, to put CMU up 
3-1. Twenty seconds later the 
teams leading goal scorer fresh
man Greg Hans scored the final 
goal of the period, getting the 
puck from Umland and doctoral 
student Dave Collins.
The second period seemed to be 
indicative, at least early on, of 
CMU hockey. Senior George 
Mueller scored after the assist 
from graduate student Scott 
Sarbacker to take the CMU lead 
to four. UPJ scored with 9:03 re
maining in the second to cut the 
deficit to 5-2. Umland, who leads 
the team in assists, scored his 
second goal of the game less than 
30 seconds later, with the assist
going to Hans. With 4:22 remain
ing in the second period, Umland 
managed a hat trick, his third 
goal of the game, again the assist 
from Hans, extending CMUs lead 
to 7-2. With just under two min
utes to play in the period, Ted 
Miller scored on a power play 
unassisted. With three seconds 
left in the period, Sarbacker 
scored to put CMU up 9-2. As
sists went to Umland and Hans.
The third period was a bit dif
ferent for CMU as they only scored 
one goal to finish the game 10-2. 
Collins scored at 8:36, assisted by 
seniors Adam Duncan and 
Mueller. UPJ couldnt score on 
CMUs second goalie, Bill Nickols, 
who came in with five minutes 
left in the second period and 
warded off eight of UP Js 16 shots.
Next week, CMU will take on 
West Virginia University at 
Golden Mile Ice Arena in 
Monroeville. CMU beat WVU on 
their home ice last year to win the 
league championship and are 
expecting another tough WVU 
team this year.
in the 200 individual medely.
Waller also won two events in 
the meet with John Carroll, while 
junior J.P. Lae won two events, 
and freshman Chris Graefe won 
another'.
For the women, freshman 
Becky Frehan had the highest 
place against IUP with a second 
in the 100 freestyle and won a 
pair of events against John 
Carroll. Junior Denise Fenwick 
also picked up two wins against 
John Carroll.

The mutch was calm compared to CMU's previous 27-5 victory against Ambridge mens club, which 
can best bo summed up as one long brawl. After losing three straight games early in the season, CMUs 
rugby club has bounced back. It has won three straight games with an average winning margin of 20 
points. CMU standout scrummer, sophomore Marcus Schlcgel, summed up the rugby clubs fall season 
by noting, Earlier this soason, it seemed as if we were all a bunch of individuals. In these last three 
games we have come together as a team. Right now, I sense a lot of love between these guys. After many 
dismal seasons, CMUs rugby club finished its fall season with a winning record of 4-3 and is looking 
favorably towards its spring season.

NFL playoff picture lacking 
shape with tight races
NFL COLUMN
by Dave Martin
So far this year, I havent made any 
strong predictions about who will par
ticipate in the Super Bowl. I groaned 
that it didnt really matter, that the 
NFC team would win the Super Bowl 
whoever they faced and whoever they 
were. Well, I still stand by that bit of 
prognostication. But its time that I sur
veyed the field and gave you a clear view 
of how the playoffs will shape up. (Of 
course, my clear view is someone elses 
clouded one.)
In the AFC East, Buffalo and Miami 
are tied for first place. My choice for this 
division is later on in the column. The 
other team will certainly pick up the 
home advantage bye week wildcard spot. 
The AFC Central is a bit trickier. -No 
team has really established itself as very 
dominant. All of the teams have dropped 
division games and only two games sepa
rate the top from the bottom. But the 
Central division will become much more 
clear with time. Cincinnatti could move 
into a wildcard position before being 
pushed out by Houston. Cleveland 
doesnt really have what it takes to take 
the division.
The AFC West isnt all too muddled. 
The mess there is approximately the 
same mess they had a year ago. Look for 
Kansas City to move into first place by 
the end of the year, currently trailing 
Denver by a game. Denver will probably 
secure a wildcard spot. So might San 
Diego.
Things in the NFC are bit simpler, as 
far as division champs go. The East 
division is all but locked up by the Dallas
Cowboys. This is the team to beat in the 
NFC. The teams only loss came at Phila
delphia on a Monday night, when the 
Eagles quarterback Randall Cun
ningham was effective. This division is 
also the tightest, with as many as three 
other teams still looking for playoff posi
tions. Philly and Washington will prob
ably get them.
Minnesota has a commanding lead in 
the Central division. The Vikings are 
the only team in the division with a 
winning record. They have that divi
sion, and no other team will get a 
wildcard bid.
In the NFC West, the situation is simi
lar. The Saints and Niners are battling 
for the division, going into yesterdays
This year, the AFC will 
belong to a team from 
the Central Division.
game tied. The rest of the division, how
ever, is out of playoff contention. The 
Niners will probably take the division, 
simply because the Saints seem to choke 
too often, whereas the Niners rarely, if 
ever, do. The Saints will get the second 
wildcard position, perhaps the first.
This Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons will 
be traveling to lovely Buffalo. The Bills 
should win, probably by a good amount. 
Look for the Falcons to play tough early 
but falter in the second half. Cincinnatti 
seems to be putting it together. Albeit, a 
little late, but the Bengals have been 
winning games no one expects them to 
win. Expect them to beat the Lions. 
Cleveland will take on Minnesota in an 
interesting yet dull matchup. Take the 
Vikings, its the better team. The Bron
cos and Raiders square off in an AFC 
grudge match. Take the Raiders in a 
mild upset. Miamis defense shouldnt
have too many problems with Houston's 
offense. Take the Dolphins at home. 
Pittsburgh should have an easy time 
with the Colts, but they probably wont. 
Take the Steelers, but dont be surprised 
by a close game. Kansas City will 
strengthen its bid for the AFC West 
division title by beating Seattle. The 
Jets should get an easy win out of the 
suffering Patriots. San Diego takes on 
Tampa Bay in a battle of the sunny 
winter cities. Take the Chargers just for 
kicks.
Chicago and Green Bay will be play
ing this weekend. Take the Bears. Dal
las should have absolutely no problem 
with Phoenix. Take the 49ers over the 
Rams in an NFC West battle. Philadel
phia and the Giants are fighting for 
position in the NFC East. Take the 
Eagles behind Randall Cunningham. 
Tonights game should be quite an inter
esting one.
The Buffalo Bills, a team that has 
been quite criticized of late for lacking in 
its usual dominance, will be playing in 
Miami against the Dolphins, the first 
team to victimize the Bills with a loss 
this year. The Dolphins seemed to suck 
the life out of the Bills by coming up with 
golden opportunities and using the here
tofore Dolphins unknown quantity, 
Keith Jackson. The Dolphins beat the 
Bills badly in Buffalo. Since then, both 
teams have dropped games. The two are 
tied for first place in the AFC East. The 
Bills lost to the Dolphins and Raiders, 
definitely teams worthy of victories. In 
the meantime the Dolphins dropped 
back-to-back games to the Indianapolis 
Colts and the New York Jets, neither of 
which are all too awe-inspiring. Take 
the Dolphins at home and give them the 
division, but dont give them the confer
ence. This year, I feel, the AFC will 
belong to a team from the Central divi
sion.

Shooting Blanks
"Getting sex in a bar is kinda like laughing at 
your own joke in a large, empty room."
The Piranha Lounge was the darkest bar I could find.
The jazz there hid Latin rhythms like night hides the day 
in the moon's improvisation 
at the star's orchestration  
two things I knew well from learning 
how to fill in the blanks.
Edgar was the darkest man I could find.
He said my eyes were like the polished jade 
of a locket swinging slowly 
in front of his getting-sleepy eyes.
What he really said was that I had pretty eyes 
while he stared a foot below them  
filling in the blanks
like time fells the creases .in your skin
caused by rumpled sheets,
marks that last longer than
the impression you left on him
because he's a man and afraid of feeling,
so if he doesn't call back,
it's a sure sign he loved you 
filling in the blanks
of all the men who seduced me
as a titty dancer
but made love to a ballerina,
even if they couldn't tell the difference.
Drawing blanks
until all I can see are blanks 
and I wouldn't know 
a Latin rhythm from any other.

Perched in a vinyl snack
bar stool and waiting for the heat
to die off my coffee
with the steam, to me the formica
counters of the laundromat
look like a smooth, unromantic
desert.
The attendant is a rock 'n roll
chick, lycra pants and black concert
t-shirts. She talks of husband-girlfriends
and wife-boyfriends
as the back-story for the real
issue: who hit
whom and paid
for what.
Every time she punctuates 
a sentence with "that bastard," 
smoke from her Newport Ultralight 
shimmies and mingles 
with smoke of a Marlboro 
in the ashtray between her 
and the man.

---------------------------------------------------



---------------------------------------------------

The man doesn't have 
laundry to wash, just a pirate loop 
ear-ring and a skinny book 
of matches. He laughs warm 
and brown like his beard 
at the appropriate times.
He has an experience
for every story she wants to tell.
I can see the two 
of them together in a panelled 
room just bigger than a double 
bed and lamp-stand. They would 
have the light on, covered by a pleated 
orange shade, giving the whole 
room a mobile-homish red glow, 
a clock-radio whispering out a classic 
rock 'n roll station.
Their hairless torsos would be unexpectedly
lithe for all the beer botdes, they don't
sweat for touching or kissing, skin
smooth and dry like baby powder. I'd
like to be in bed beside
them as they fall into the rhythm
of their lovemaking like an easy
habit with a velvet Jesus painting
taking in the whole scene.

pfcabiography
Charles D. Sabatos
The alphabet came before toy tracks and balls and stuffed 
animals. My mother read stories to me, like In a People House, 
with a nice bird and a naughty mouse who looked around the 
house when the people were away. Look out below, Im going to 
crash! she would read as I rolled off the edge of the couch onto the 
floor and crashed beside her feet. Sometimes I would stay on the 
floor and talk to her feet, whose names were Buggy and Mrs. Poo. 
But usually I would sit back up right away and listen to the rest of 
the story.
My first love was Cinderella. When looking avidly 
through my four or five storybook versions was not enough, I 
would be eager to act it out, for a fuller experience. But being an 
only child, I had to play the parts by myself. Sometimes, 
especially if it was raining, I played with my mother, in the early 
afternoon between lunch and her daytime nap. Our acting, such 
as it was, was limited to two roles. Usually, I played the helpless 
girl in cinders, and my mother became the tall, strong prince. Plot 
development was unnecessary, indeed impossible with no one to 
play the evil stepsisters, so we literally cut to the chase. My 
favorite part was fleeing endlessly down the stairs to the 
basement, with my Prince Mother in close pursuit. For added 
dramatic effect, I would wear her fuzzy blue bedroom slippers, 
being sure to wriggle out of one of them halfway down the 
staircase. They were so big that occasionally both of them got 
behind and had to dash back to retrieve one of them.
For the resolution of the tale, we would resume our 
natural genders. My mother was a natural for the part where the 
Cinderella tries the glass slipper on, and the Prince finds that it 
fits her perfectly. Worn out from chasing an exuberant threeyear-old, she would sit on the couch, and crouching next to her 
foot I would take one of the bedroom slippers and slide it on 
triumphantly.
After that, of course, we had to dance in celebration that 
Cinderella had been found. We would spin around in circles, her 
lifting me slightly into the air. I needed someone shorter to dance 
with. I definitely needed a sister.

---------------------------------------------------

I was three and a half when Mark was born. It was a 
bewildering thing to have a younger brother, a situation for which 
I was not at all prepared. Not only did he take up most of the 
time that my mother had formerly, rightfully, devoted to me, but 
he was utterly useless as a playmate. In the late morning when 
the sun shone right into the living room she would read to both of 
us. But when she got to the part Look out below! Mark would 
refuse to crash. As I gleefully sprawled across the floor, his huge 
blue eyes would stare down at me at if I were an absolute idiot.
Then, after only a few stories, my mother went to take her 
nap, tucking Mark into his crib as well. As soon as she dozed off, I 
would creep into Marks room with some of my favorite books and 
start to read to him. (Not all of the stories needed little girls after 
all. When he got a little older, perhaps we could play Jack and the 
Beanstalk.) But as soon as I showed him the first page, he would 
begin to cry and I would look up guiltily to see my mothers 
annoyed face in the doorway. Leave Mark alone. Hes taking a 
nap.
Playing outside was just as fun, anyway. Along the side of 
the house were tall green shrubs. I could creep behind them, 
unseen by the neighbor kids who were usually playing noisily next 
door. Right at the edge of my yard, their property rose up steeply 
to form a sort of plateau above mine. Clinging to the edge of this 
plateau was what they called the treehouse, although it was not 
a tree at all. It was actually a metal tower, at least ten feet tall, 
with a platform at the top that could only be reached by climbing 
rusty rungs. I climbed it once, and my terror was all the worse for 
the lack of concern it caused the neighbor kids.
As soon as I went into the backyard, some of the neighbor 
kids saw me and came down, urging me to join them. I was 
irritated; Id just begun to have time to myself and I wanted to 
play at my house. The big kids went back to the treehouse. But 
sometimes Julie Jacks, the youngest, would stay and play. Julie 
was a year younger than me. She was no substitute for the sister 
I was awaiting: she was much too bossy and had the tendency to 
run back to her house whenever we got in a fight. Sometimes, 
though, we would go inside the cool dark gameroom, sit on the 
couch and listen to records. Our favorite was my unofficial 
soundtrack of the Wizard of Oz . My favorite song was when 
Dorothy was caught by the witch and trapped in her castle:
Somewhere, theres sunshine and laughter 
Somewhere birds sing all day through 
Somewhere, oh thats where I wish I were 
Somewhere out there with you.
I found this rather poor imitation of Over the Rainbow just as 
wonderful as the real songs from the movie. We would listen to it 
over and over, sometimes skipping the rest of the record entirely. 
Julie grew tired of it long before I did; when I refused her pleas to
listen to the Candy Man record, she would leave. I didnt care; it 
was late in the afternoon and not long until dinnertime.
Walking back out onto the patio, I would crouch at the far 
comer, against the house, and examine a tiny footprint set into 
the cement. It was mine. I didnt remember the day when my 
parents had built the patio, but I had looked at the pictures in the 
family scrapbooks. I could imagine my helpless surprise as my 
mother had scooped me up and pressed my wiggling foot into the 
oozing cement. I squirmed a bit as I thought what might have 
happened if my mother had left me in the cement too long. 
Standing with one foot next to the faded imprint, I gazed in 
wonder; my foot was nearly twice as long as it had been that day.
My brother was growing as well. But his light red hair 
and blue eyes were alien to me, especially since my father had the 
same brown hair and eyes that my mother and I did. Marks 
actions were just as strange. He would run around endlessly, 
playing with the trucks and balls that I had always neglected, and 
refusing to listen to my sensible rules, which was rather rude 
since he was more than a year old.
During the Bicentennial celebration, I grew fascinated 
with flags. Betsy Ross had replaced Cinderella as my heroine of 
choice. I had collected a dozen American flags of various sizes  
my favorites were the colonial ones with a circle of thirteen stars 
against the field of blue. I liked to plant the flags, on their slender 
wooden stakes, to colonize various corners of the yard. I even 
made my own flags on huge sheets of white paper. I glued strips 
of red crepe paper across the whole sheet, leaving stripes of white 
in between. In the comer I pasted foamy blue dryer sheets. 
Sometimes I cut out little crooked paper stars, but often I drew 
them with a felt-tip pen. As I busily sewed my Old Glory, I 
wrapped my favorite blanket  a little rectangle of yellow yarn 
unraveling at the edges  around my head as a sort of oldfashioned bonnet. Needless to say, my activities  as colonizer or 
colonist  did not interest Mark in the least.
About that time I found out that my mother was having 
another baby. This time I knew that her tummy would grow until, 
if I was lucky and had my hand near the belly button at the right 
time, I could feel the baby kicking to get out. I was not surprised 
when she was gone for a few days, or at the swarm of the 
neighbors (even some I usually never saw) who stopped by when 
she returned. The house was very messy and warm. My mother 
had brought back interesting little bottles that looked to be full of 
bright yellow pee but when gingerly tasted turned out to be sweet 
tingly mouthwash. She had also brought back another baby, 
wrapped in a blue checked quilt, who was was plumper than Mark 
with a little bruise at one side of his face, but unmistakably a boy. 
I was hardly disappointed at all this time. Greg was more fun to 
play with  he didnt cry as much, or at least he didnt get me in 
trouble as much. Sometimes he even got Mark in trouble. I didnt 
have as much time to play, anyway, because by this time Iwas in 
first grade at Poff Elementary. When I was home, my mother was 
less thorough in administering justice, now that she had a 
growing family to raise.

---------------------------------------------------

CAofc Chnrfwi \)ocioreEvery Sunday morning we went to mass at St. Catherines 
of Sweden. My parents sang the Catholic hymns with the 
unseemly fervor of Baptists. I dutifully opened the missalette and 
held the page open for Mark, who didnt care to pay attention. My 
mother interrupted her singing: Stop teasing your brother. I 
couldnt sing loud enough nor pray long enough. Two or three 
times during every mass, we had to kneel for long tedious 
stretches of silence. I prayed for my parents, then (briefly) for my 
brothers, then (fervently) for a sister.
After mass I went to the school next to the church. The 
rooms were dim and full of old furniture, not like my regular 
school at all. This was not regular school; this was C.C.D. (I liked 
that name better than Sunday school, it was more alphabetical.
I could never remember what the initials stood for, but some of the 
bad kids said it meant Central City Dump.) I didnt know some 
of the kids; the others went to my regular school but I didnt like 
them very much.
My C.C.D. teacher was a sturdy middle-aged woman with 
pale yellow hair curling away from her stern florid face. One 
morning she told us, with her usual brusqueness, that to love 
Jesus we had to love everybody in the world. There was general 
confusion at this seemingly impossible command. In my 
bewilderment, I felt a rare unity with my classmates.
But what if we dont like somebody? asked one of the 
bolder boys.
The teacher paused. Well, you dont have to like them, 
but you still have to love them.
This philosophy was quite very useful at Poff School, 
where I was learning a lot. I didnt like many of the boys, whether 
God wanted me to love them or not. They were always running 
around on the field below the school, playing football or baseball. 
They asked me to play with them, but I usually refused. I stayed 
on the blacktop with the girls and played foursquare or even 
jump-rope. I was never very good at the latter; I was afraid of 
jumping toward the whirling rope. Usually, I would wander the 
playground with a single friend  Amy or Marcie  riding the 
swingsets or climbing the monkey bars, and talking.
My C.C.D. lesson was equally useful at home. I gave up 
trying to like my brothers, and loved them instead a love that 
was often betrayed when, hearing them fight in the other room, I 
would come over and separate them, only to have both of them 
turn against me when my mother arrived. In the meantime, I was 
still praying for a sister.
Departures
As the afternoons shrank away into grey autumn 
evenings, my new favorite book became The Secret Garden. I 
filled notebooks, complete with illustrations, with shorter 
adaptions of the story. Mary Lennox, who had joined Cinderella 
and Betsy Ross in my affections, was a little English girl from
India who moved to a big mansion on the moors of England. It 
was full of spooky sounds and cries in the night. But one day, 
while wandering in the gardens, she found a rusty key which, she 
believed, was the key to the long-lost secret garden. Then, 
behind the thick ivy in an old brick wall, she found a hidden door.
Dinnertime! I was reading in the living room, at one em 
of the couch, so I couldnt pretend that I hadnt heard my mother. 
Reluctantly, I put the book aside just as I was about to enter 
Marys secret garden.
My parents had a secret of their own. They told me that 
we were going to be moving to a new house two doors down the 
street. It sounded ridiculous to me. The neighbors had a nice 
swimming pool in the back yard, but our house was  ours. 
Wasnt my footprint in one corner of the patio?
But the other house has one extra bedroom, said my 
parents. I was mildly interested  did that mean that my 
brothers and I would all have our own rooms? No, my mother 
explained, there was another reason we needed an extra bedroom 
She was having another baby. I was terribly torn: having anothei 
sibling (a sister?) was potentially thrilling, but leaving my 
childhood home was the first major upheaval in my seven years. ' 
took the opportunity to assess my life in a complete 
autobiography. I drew the illustrations, intending to fill the story 
in later. Julie was a nice girl, was the caption of the first 
picture, which resembled Mary Lennox more than the chubby five 
year-old neighbor I remembered (she had moved when I was in 
kindergarten.) Then I drew a picture of my happy life in what I 
had already begun to think of as the old house, although we 
were not going to move until January, and ended with the caption 
I dont want to go!
That Christmas was our last in the old house. A few days 
after New Years 1979 (I was beginning to think of the years as 
separate and distinct, now that I was getting to be a big kid,) nr 
mother went into the hospital again. My father stayed with her, 
and our neighbor, Mrs. Fabian, came to watch the three of us. 
Mark and Greg were in bed. I was sitting upstairs in the living 
room with Mrs. Fabian. The Christmas decorations were still up: 
my mother was as thorough and creative in decorating for the 
seasons as one would expect from a former elementary 
schoolteacher. It was dark outside, and rather eerie inside, by th( 
light of a single lamp. I sat on the couch, reading Hans Christian 
Andersens The Little Match Girl in an anthology of holiday 
stories. The little girl in the story wandered the streets barefoot 
in the snow on New Years Eve, trying to earn a few pennies 
selling matches to the passersby. At last, she huddled in a corner 
and began lighting the matches to warm herself. With each 
match, she saw a delicious feast, or a cozy parlor, or  the last 
vision  her grandmother, in heaven. On the first day of the ne\s 
year  it gave me a chill as the story came to a close  the little 
match girl was found frozen to death.
The phone rang, and Mrs. Fabian went to get it. Oh, 
hello! It was apparently my parents. Her tone changed subtly. 
She was listening rather than talking, and at the end of the 
conversation she sounded rather subdued. She came into the 
living room to tell me the news. The baby had been born. Her

---------------------------------------------------

name was Mary Beth. But, as my father explained when he came 
home, Mary Beth was veiy sick. I was happy anyway. X had 
a sister at last. God had heard all of my prayers and had even 
noticed all of the times Id taken the blame for something Mark or 
Greg had broken or spilled. I loved everybody, especially Mary 
Beth, and I wanted to see her. But at the same time I was slightly 
afraid.
My mother came home a few days later, with the usual 
bottles of mouthwash and packets of crackers, but without the 
baby. She explained it to me in more detail. Mary Beth had been 
bom unable to breathe. The doctors had put in a trach, which was 
a hole in the outside of her throat. I learned the new word 
eagerly: trach, but felt my throat rather gingerly whenever I 
thought about it too much. My parents had a big baptism 
ceremony at St. Catherines Church. Their friends, including 
several priests, and many of our relatives were there, but the baby 
was not. Afterwards everyone went back to the old house to 
celebrate. My mother put all of the casseroles people had brought 
on a table in the kitchen. In the middle was a white-frosted cake, 
crowned with a little pink angel. I thought it was odd to have a 
baptism without the baby; it was like having a wedding without 
the bride or even a funeral without the coffin.
Mary Beth was still in the hospital when we moved to the 
new house. Rainy days in January are not the most pleasant time 
to cany couches and beds outside, and I was glad that I didnt 
have to do the hard work. The same day, strangely, a television 
adaption of The Secret Garden was on, and I sat in the game room 
of the old house in front of our big T.V., watching it eagerly as my 
uncles carted away the furniture all around me. Then the show 
was over, literally they unplugged the T.V. and carried it into 
the driveway. I took one last glance at the stairway down which 
Cinderella had fled long ago, and followed them out the back door 
into the drizzle. I looked at the footprint, now an indistinct 
crevice in the cement, and walked across the next door neighbors 
front yard to the new house.
Eclipse
The new house was a clutter of boxes and furniture in 
disarray. The bedroom that Mark and I shared in the basement 
was cozy, as soon as I unpacked most of my books. Upstairs were 
three bedrooms; one for my parents, one for Greg, and one, 
painted pink, where the empty crib stood.
My sister came home at the beginning of February. She 
was tiny and very red, and her trach was covered with a bandage. 
I sat on the floor of her room, holding her in my arms while my 
mother went to get her bottle. Unlike Mark and Greg, Mary Beth 
never cried, and she usually sat still in my arms. I talked to her 
and wiggled her toes, which were even tinier than the little 
footprint in the old patio. On the wall hung an faded needlepoint 
that my mothers grandmother had stitched years ago. A tiny girl 
in a blue dress, with a lamb beside her, knelt above the rather 
disturbing prayer:
Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep 
If I should die before I wake 
I pray the Lord my soul to take.. .
A few weeks later, I woke up one morning rather early and 
wandered upstairs. It was noisier than usual, and there were 
more lights on. My father was still home  he was almost always 
off to work before I got up. My mother met me at the top of the 
stairs, strangely calm. I didnt have to go to school that day.
Mary Beth had died the night before, in her sleep.
She was always so sick, my mother explained, in a 
reasonable voice. Its probably a blessing for her, that she never 
had to grow up and be sick any longer.
The next few days were such a rush of events that I was 
almost numb. Mark was somewhat aware of our sisters death, 
but Greg could not comprehend it. Then again, I wasnt sure that 
I could even begin to understand it myself, living in the new house 
that wed bought for the new sister who I had only seen for three 
weeks and would never see again. Should I feel happy for her, or 
sad for myself? Or was I sad at all?
My parents came home from the funeral home, having 
selected a tiny pink casket. Will people be able to see the trach?
I asked.
No, said my mother. Were not going to open the
casket.
Why? It sounded stupid to me.
Usually, people dont have viewings for babies. Mary 
Beth was so little.
I felt stirrings of resentment at being deprived of my last 
chance to see my sister. For the first time I argued with my 
parents and for the first time that I could remember they agreed.
Mary Beths funeral was at our church, where her baptism 
had been held less than two months before. Many of the same 
people attended that solemn reenactment. At the funeral home, 
Mary Beths coffin was open, because, as I overheard my mother 
explaining, Chuckie wanted it that way. I stepped through the 
gathering, leaving my parents and my brothers surrounded by 
sympathizers in the middle of the room, and walked over to the 
tiny lifeless form, looking at it almost in wonder. Everyone could 
look at my sister, and it was all because of me. My sisters death 
had given me the most power I had ever experienced, and yet it 
had shown me how powerless I actually was.
Impulsively, I reached forward and rested my fingers 
briefly on the tiny forehead. The touch of her skin felt like rubber 
stretched over a very cold stonean image which I remember 
thinking the exact moment I withdrew my fingers.
We planted geraniums on Mary Beths grave  there was 
no headstone for over a year. My father declared that there was a 
new angel in heaven, and prayed to St. Mary Beth. The crib was 
piit away in the attic and the pink room upstairs became a guest 
bedroom. I used to sit in it and read, feeling like Cinderella after 
the ball, sitting on the hearth with nothing to hold but a single 
glass slipper.

Most smokers already 
follow regulations
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Staffwriter
Student Senate passed a resolution in September which banned smoking in 
student organization offices and all indoor activities sponsored by a student 
organization and partially or totally funded by the student Activities Fee. In 
honor of the Great American Smokeout, smokers on campus voiced their 
opinions about the Senate smoking resolution.
The resolution regarding Carnegie Mellon smoking policy which passed on 
September 22,1992 begins whereas Carnegie Mellon Student Senate recog
nizes the need to accomodate the preferences of smokers and non-smokers... 
Smokers on campus voiced many concerns about the consideration of both 
smokers and non-smokers.
I dont think [consideration] is a big problem, said freshman drama 
student Carl Smith. Many students, including senior drama major Alan 
Middleton, agreed with Smith stating that they certainly respect nonsmokers rights.
Alison OBrien, 1992 Psychology Department graduate and current staff 
member said, Even though I am a smoker, I don't think you should be stinking 
up other peoples space.
Some smokers however did voice concerns about where smoking should or 
should not be allowed. One freshman voice major who wished to remain 
unnamed said, When youre trying to work, especially sing or play an 
instrument, the smoke from someones cigarette can be really annoyingnot 
that I am biased, because I smoke. But if I want a cigarette badly enough, lean 
go outside and have one.
Students expressed concern that there be clearly marked, designated 
smoking areas within buildings.
Sophomore music major Alicia Allen said that having designated indoor 
smoking areas is especially important during periods of cold weather.
In regard to policy for student offices, Smith said that, although he does not

By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
Recent proposals regarding smoking 
have caused problems for some on cam
pus  non-smokers feel as if their rights 
are being violated, while smokers feel as 
if they are being unfairly punished. Sev
eral students on campus have voiced 
their opinions on what they feel is an 
infringement on their good health.
Sophomore H&SS student Joshua 
Knauer is doing something about this 
imposition on his health. Knauer, an 
H&SS StudentSenator, presented a pro
posal to Student Senate which would 
ban smoking in all indoor public areas. 
I respect the right that smokers have to 
smoke, said Knauer. Its just when it 
affects me that its upsetting. Knauers 
proposal was passed, but in a different 
form. Smoking is currently banned in 
all areas except where posted that it is 
allowed.
Knauer, along with several fellow 
members of the Student Environmental 
Action Coalition, is helping Student 
Health Staff Nurse Rowena Lynch by 
manning some tables for this weeks 
Great American Smokeout.
Knauer has spoken to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Michael Murphy and CMDS
management, but his efforts have (as of 
yet) proved unfruitful. Both were sup
portive, said Knauer, but suggested I 
try to make progress through Student 
Senate. Knauer would like to see Cam
pus Police and CMDS employees en
force the policies that do exist on cam
pus. Id also like to see officers not 
smoke on duty  it sets a horrible ex
ample, said Knauer. He will also present 
a second proposal to Student Senate 
again next semester, which will include 
a motion to impose the same $50 fine 
that the city of Pittsburgh has here on 
campus.
Freshman CIT student Truman 
Fenton is also doing his part to purify 
the air he breathes. Ashtrays provided 
for smokers at benches in a Hamerschlag
Hall stairwell were removed after 
Fenton discussed the matter with 
Murphy and Environmental Health and 
Safetys Peter Collope. Anywhere that 
people are smoking indoors should be 
adequately ventilated, said Fenton. 
If people are smoking and breaking 
the law, Ill ask them to please stop,  
hes only had one group of smokers ' 
refuse (albeit in the non-smoking sec
tion of the Tartan Grill).
Both of these students agree that 
there needs to be some type of enforce
ment  which no campus organization 
or administration seems willing to pro
vide. I feel sorry for smokers because 
theyre addicted, said Knauer. When 
people smoke, it affects not only them, 
but everyone around them.
...A custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to 
the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to 
the lungs, and in the black stinking fume 
thereof nearest resembling the horrible 
Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless.

Smokeout calls 
smokers to quit
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
This Thursday, millions of smokers throughout the nation will join, under 
the auspices of the American Cancer Society (ACS), in the 16th Annual Great 
American Smokeout. By asking participants to lighten up instead of 
lighting up, ACS hopes to convince people not to smoke, dip, or chew for at 
least 24 hours.
Rowena Lynch, staff nurse for Student Health Services, is doing her part for 
the Smokeout here at Carnegie Mellon. Despite the fact that her grandfather 
died of lung cancer, Lynch is the only non-smoker out of six children and both 
parents in her family. To help the fight against this killer habit, Lynch has 
masterminded a Great American Smokeout drive on campus, preparing 
Survival Kits and Adopt-a-Smoker proposals. Were trying to promote 
awareness toward a healthier lifestyle, says Lynch. Students in the Health 
Professions Program, directed by professor Ann Robinson, will also bo 
manning the four tables set up on campus, to collect cigarettes and chewing 
tobacco in return for apples, candy, and advice on how to quit smoking 
permanently. 80 percent of smokers start before 21 years of ago, says Lynch. 
This is a good target age.
Smoking is a bigger problem today than one might realize. Each clay, more 
than 3,000 teenagers become regular smokers in the United States alone, and 
75 percent of these come from homes where parents smoko. By the time tlioso 
students reach college age, 25.9 percent of them are frequent smokers. In 
addition, white males smoke more cigarettes per dqy than any otlior group. 
I would like to have people not even start in the first place, says Lynch.
Smokeless tobacco use has increased greatly over the years. Between 1970 
and 1986, snuff use increased by 15 times, and 21.4 percent of users start at 
ages 19-20. Oral cancer occurs more frequently in smokeless tobacco users 
than non-users, and habitual use leads to a decrease in taste and smell and 
an increase in receding gums and tooth decay. Use also leads to leukoplakia, 
an oral condition whose symptoms include white spots on gums that are 
sometimes pre-cancerous.
The incidence of cancer and mortality are greatly increased by smoking. 
ACS estimates that there will be 168,000 new cases of lung cancer and 
146,000 lung cancer deaths in 1992. Smoking has also been implicated as a 
cause of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pancreas, cervix, and bladder. 
Smoking in women is on the rise, too. By the mid-90s, ACS estimates that 
female smokers will outnumber male smokers for the first time in history. 
More women have died of lung cancer than breast cancer since 1987  breast

Virtual Reality games 
provide illusion, diversion

Students battled each other and their "virtual environments last Thursday In AB Special Events Virtual Reality, held in the 
Wherrett Room. Tickets, which were $2 for five minutes of play, completely sold out.
By ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Staffwriter
Virtual is defined as existing or re
sulting in essence or effect though not in 
actual fact, while reality is defined as 
the state of being actual or true. So, Im 
not sure if this is the most apt descrip
tion of the Virtual Reality games that 
CMU experienced last Thursday (which 
is probably as close to the real thing as 
they will ever get), but at least it looked 
fun.
The 12-hour living video game was 
brought to campus by AB Special Events. 
I think a better description of Virtual 
Reality is the phrase, someone is steal
ing my socks and underwear. While I 
realize that statement is ridiculous, can 
you explain to me why they are disap
pearing? In other words, no one is really 
stealing my underwear, but virtually 
the same thing is happening.
Players totally immerse themselves 
in computer generated images. They are 
able to do this by putting on special 
headgear that totally blocks out every
thing around them. The helmet fills the 
ears with quadrophonic sound, and the 
eyes are covered with two miniature 
television monitors. Two people play at 
each turn, and they fight against each 
other within the video game.
I never got to play the game, but I did 
talk to some people who did, and the 
reactions were quite diverse.
They ranged from I thought it was 
pretty cool, to, It sucked. However, 
the general reaction seemed to be over
whelmingly positive.
Watching it all happen was interest
ing also. People were ac
tually ducking as ptero
dactyls dove from out of 
the sky.
When they were actu
ally picked up by the di
nosaurs, I was told that 
some people even flailed, 
as though they were actu
ally being carried away.
Josh Schacter, a CIT 
freshman, said, When 
you get shot, it actually
feels like you are getting blown up. 
The technology behind Virtual Real
ity seems to be the next great thing in 
the fieldof medicine, space exploration, 
and engineering. There are lots of ap
plications, but I 
cant help thinking 
that yet another 
great idea (i.e. tele
vision, computer 
technology) is be
ing turned into a 
mind-numbing lei
sure activity.

Its that time of year again, when we gather around a specially-prepared 
bounty of birds to share a moment of tradition passed down from year to 
year. No, were not talking about Moms Thanksgiving feast -were talking 
about the third annual Wing-a-Thon.
Sponsored this year by the Alpha Kappa chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi 
fraternity, located at our own Carnegie Mellon University, this event 
benefits the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Greater Pittsburgh. It will 
take place at 7 pm this Wednesday in Skibo Ballroom.
With the efforts of organizations from both Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne 
University, Doug Brook, junior English major and president of Alpha 
Epsilon Pi, says they are anticipating over $5000 in contributions for the 
research of diabetes.
These funds are based on pledges solicited by the organizations for how 
many wings their team of four people will eat. The winning team  whoever 
raises the most money  will host the Wing-a-Thon next year.
Originally for Greek organizations only, participation in the Wing-a-Thon 
has now been opened to any group who wishes to be a part of the event, as 
an effort to raise more money for research.
Sophomore mechanical engineering major Burt Holzman, who is the 
philanthropy chair of the hosting fraternity, says he expects a significant 
showing from Duquesne Universitys fraternities and sororities.
Although the majority of participants from CMU are also Greek houses 
(three of the four sororities and over half of the fraternities), other groups 
that have offered their wing-scarfing services include the Housing Office 
and the Campus Association for Reproductive Rights.

take in unwanted carcinogens, that will 
eventually bring about cancer that in
volves painful, unproven therapy which 
in the long run proves to only have 
lengthened a now miserable existence. 
Boy, some people will nit-pick about the 
smallest things. There are some posi
tive aspects of smokingat least cranky 
ex-smokers tend not to hang around 
you.
Which brings me to another aspect of 
being a non-smoker for a day. I wanted
to experience it in all aspects; therefore, 
when I went to eat lunch, I sat in the 
non-smoking section. Usually, lunch is 
an enjoyable experience. People around 
me can be heard talking of topics rang
ing from art openings to the open con
vertible they threw up in the night beThe non-smoking section ... was almost equiva
lent to being in a rather strict church service.... 
The most interesting conversation I heard was 
two people arguing over which Star Trek movie 
was better, the one directed by William Shatner 
or the one by Leonard Nimoy.
fore. And thats when the smoking sec
tion is mild. It would be illegal to print 
what happens on days when the crowd 
gets unruly.
The non-smoking section, on the other 
hand, was almost equivalent to being in 
a rather strict church service. Conversa
tion was muted and  well, I hope I 
dont offend anyone  but BORING is 
the word that comes to mind. The most 
interesting conversation I heard was 
two people arguing over which Star Trek 
movie was better, the one directed by 
William Shatner or the one by Leonard 
Nimoy. (I dont remember what tho out
come was, mostly bocauso I didnt caro.)
When it was almost time for mo to quit 
quitting, I just couldn't understand why 
ovoryono complains about quitting  
its not that hard. Of course, I used 
something to help take the edge off and 
Im surprised more people dont tako 
advantage of 
modern medicine 
to help. Heroin 
really helped me 
forget all about 
smoking. Just 
kidding. There is

___________________ help you quit.
And while it 
doesnt really 
help, eating seems to go along with quit
ting. I gain weight just thinking about it.
When people see me smoking, they 
often say things like, Dont you know 
youre killing yourself? Why dont you 
just go ahead and jump off of a bridge or 
something? To which I reply, Well, you 
know, I would, but I find that I dont 
quite get that same nicotine rush when 
I jump off of bridges.
Lets faco it  not smoking is prob
ably, in tho short run anyway, as un
healthy as just going ahoad and pouring 
that tar in your lungs.
Mmm mmm good.

cancer had been the primary cause of cancerous death for 40 years prior to 1987. 
More men are quitting than women, too (49 percent vs. 42 percent). [Smokingrelated illness and death] is frustrating because its so preventable, says Lynch.
Smoking has also had a grave impact on the economy. The Office of Technology 
Assessment (OTA) estimates that smoking costs the economy $65 billion annu
ally. This includes $22 billion in smoking-related health care and $43 billion in 
smoking-related productivity costs  adding up to a cost of $2.17 to the United 
States economy for each pack of cigarettes. The federal government also spends 
an additional $4.2 billion annually in Medicare and Medicaid payments.
So what can you do to help a smoker this Thursday? Its a light, fun day, says 
Lynch, not to preach or scold. Adopt a Smoker  help a friend have the 
willpower to quit. Give up something you lovelike chocolate or beerto show 
your support. Take your friend to dinner (and sit in the non-smoking section).

 28.1 percent of Americans smoke  27.8 percent of whites, 31.7 percent 
of blacks, and 23.5 percent of hispanics.
 34 percent of smokers have less than a high school diploma. 32 percent 
have a high school diploma, 25.4 percent have some college, and only 
15.9 percent of smokers have a college degree.
-  In general, men smoke more cigarettes per day than women, and 
whites smoke more per day than blacks.
 25.9 percent of smokers are between the ages of 18 and 24  25.5 
percent of males and 26.3 percent of females.
 Teenagers who plan to complete four years of college have smok
ing rates less than half of those without such plans.
 41 percent of military personnel smoke, compared with 28 
percent of the general population.
 21.8 percent of adults with a household income of $40,000 
or more smoke, as opposed to 28.0 percent of those from 
$30,000-$40,000, and 31.4 percent of those from $20,000- 
$30,000.
 The estimated probability of dying in the next 17 years 
for males at age 40 is 11 percent for smokers and 5 
percent for non-smokers. At age 50, these figures are 
27 percent and 11 percent, and at age 65, 68 percent 
and 46 percent, respectively.
 Cigarette smoking is responsible for 90 percent of lung 
cancer cases among men and 79 percent among women 
 about 87 percent overall.
Since 1987, more women have died of lung cancer than breast cancer. 
For more than 40 years, breast cancer was the major cause of cancer death 
among women.CGsGtvGtev eOrnGavo OP LasyGU Canlteav

Nicholas Nickleby 
shines at Kresge
By ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Staffivriter
Four shillings for one play? Well, with a lot of 
people in it and it is very long. These words, 
spoken in CMUs 1992 senior production, are a 
better description of Nicholas Nickleby than I 
could ever come up with. Moreover, it was worth 
it. The plays total running time is approximately 
eight and a half hours, and I mean this with the 
utmost sincerity, it did not seem to last half that 
time. Even though the play could run fine in eight 
hours, the production crew, ever concerned about 
keeping the audience content, broke it up into two 
separate partsapproximately four hours apiece.
Every aspect of production was done with such 
professionalism and slickness that one would be 
hard pressed to complain about any part of the 
play. It was overwhelming.
This particular production was full of a lot of 
firsts for a CMU production. The cast of this play, 
requiring more than 53 actors, included people 
from outside the CMU community and also from 
the faculty of the CMU drama department. Moat 
notable, from outside CMU and members of the 
Actors Equity Association, were Laurie Klatscher 
(Mrs. Nickleby and Mrs. Curdle), Tony McKay 
(Ralph Nickleby), and Don Wadsworth (Newton 
Noggs and Handsaw). Also from Actors Equity 
were Lynne Innerst, Matt Tobin, and Robert 
Parks. CMU faculty in the play were Elisabeth 
Orion (Head of the Drama department and Head 
of acting), Judy Conte (Movement and Dance), 
and Janet Morrison (Acting and Directing). The

Speaker evokes 
cyberspace
By KRISTEN BEVERIDGE
Tartan Staffivriter
Imagine being able to function 
in a computer-generated environ
ment, similar to those in the mov
ies Tron and Total Recall. Imag
ine being able to meet with people 
on the other side of the world 
without ever leaving your home, 
discover endless amounts of in
formation at your disposal, defy 
gravity  all through computersimulated imaging. These ideas 
may seem far out" to many of us 
but not according to Michael 
Benedikt, who spoke here at the 
Alumni Concert Hall on Tuesday 
on the issues of virtual reality or 
cyberspace in architecture.
Benedikt is one of the contribu
tors to the first Aris publication, 
Carnegie Mellons architecture 
journal, which came out this fall. 
He was brought to CMU as the 
initial speaker in what Todd 
Sanders (Arch., 92) says will be 
the first of many Aris lectures. 
Currently a professor at the Uni
versity of Texas at Austin, 
Benedikt is also the author oftwo 
books, For an Architecture of Re
ality and Deconstructing the 
Kimbell, and he is also the editor 
of the book, Cyberspace. He is 
presently working on a third book 
dealing with the study of depth.
Benedikt began the talk with a 
discussion challenging the defi
nitions of what is real and what is 
deep. He focused upon buildings 
in post-modern society which 
have become victims of a sign, 
symbol, and consumer-oriented 
culture and as a result have lost 
their realness. A good example 
of this phenomenon can be seen 
in the structures in Disney World, 
with their blatant facade-oriented 
exteriors, comparable to the ic
ing on birthday cake  Benedikt 
might refer to them as enter
taining shelters. Buildings, ac
cording to Benedikt, should pos
ses the same qualities as found 
objects; things that are found to 
be useful and important, not 
things that are intended to serve 
a purpose and simultaneously 
convey an entirely different mes
sage. This point was illustrated 
by a 20 minute silent slide pre
sentation in which two screens 
were used side by side with slides 
consisting of anything from trees
and fields to the hallways of a 
Mexican childrens school. AH of 
the images depicted a sense of 
depth and realness whether it be 
in nature or architecture.
After tho first set of slides, the 
topic changed focus to the issue of 
depth in a different area; the 
depth of cyberspace. Cyberarch
itecture deals with architectural 
design on a purely technological, 
computer-oriented level. Build
ings can now be designed solely 
on the computer, and with the 
use of light, scanners, and per
spective views; they can be recre
ated in virtual reality and en
tered by humans before they are 
even constructed. Benedikt an
ticipates that the time will come 
when many buildings wont be 
built, because it will only be nec
essary for them to function in 
cyberspace rather than in the real 
world. Not all. structures will be 
computer-generated, but there 
will be a definite and obligatory 
split between traditional archi
tecture and cyberarchitecture. 
Because our society is so crazed 
for information, cyberspace will 
be our epitome of a dimension in 
which everything is broken up 
into data rather than tangible 
objects. Benedikt drew the fan
tastic analogy that Cyberspace 
is where your money is when you 
put it in the bank.
In the near future, virtual real
ity may very well be part of our 
everyday lives (whether we want 
it or not)a place where we will 
have business interactions and 
endless amounts of recreation and 
entertainment. Our world will be 
expanded so immensely that 
right, left, up, and down will no 
longer hold so much significance. 
Many believe that human beings 
wont be as significant either  
we will be tho subjects of a mass 
network computer. At the end of 
the lecture, many of the ques
tions asked of Benedikt expressed 
fears and concerns of cyberspace 
and its potential to become like 
Big Brother, to dehumanize and 
become the ultimate societal es
capist drug (we already know 
some of those email addicts). His 
responses were all very calm and 
optimistic, but it didnt appear as 
if he took the threat of these is
sues too seriously.

Go see Malcolm X 'by 
any means necessary
By NICOLE ALLEN
Tartan Staffivriter
Malcolm X was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom in New 
York at age 39. Rarely has a man who lived such a brieflifeleft such 
a lasting impression on his contemporaries and generations that 
followed. People view him in different ways, and for the most part, 
he has been largely misunderstood.
As his legacy continues, people try to sort through the myths to 
see who Malcolm X truly was. Spike Lees answer to that question 
is the film Malcolm X.
Acclaimed filmmaker Lee brings to the screen the fascinating 
life of this visionary black leader. This film is based on the book The 
Autobiography ofMalcolmX as told to Alex Haley and a screenplay 
by Lee and Arnold Pearl. Labeled as the eye-opening film of the 
year, Malcolm X sets out to do just that.
The brilliant cast illuminates the many people and events that 
shaped the life of the leader Malcolm X. The cast includes Denzel 
Washington, Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, A1 Freeman, Jr., Delroy 
Undo, and Lee, as well as many others.
This film stars Academy Award winner Washington in the title 
role of Malcolm Little, who was known at different times as Detroit 
Red, Satan, Malcolm X, and ElHajj Malik El-Shabazz. This is 
Washingtons second collabo
ration with Spike Lee, having 
previously worked and starred 
with the director in Mo' Better 
Blues.
He is also no stranger to play
ing the role of Malcolm X as he 
starredin the Negro Ensemble 
Companys production of When 
the Chickens Came Home to 
Roost. On the big screen, he 
certainly had his work cut out 
for him with the enormous re
sponsibility of bringing Mal
colm X to life.
In order to achieve this, there 
must be a great actor, and Spike 
Lee picked a winner in Wash
ington. The audience was
eOrnGavo Wsngan DnOGUanv9 pgeq 
Malcolm (Denzel Washington) addresses an audience of Harlem 
residents outside the legendary Apollo Theatre In Malcolm X.
moved by his performance and realistic portrayal of one of the 
most charismatic political voices in American history.
The supporting cast brings to life the different people who came 
in and out of Malcolm Xs life and helped make him the man he 
was. PortrayingMalcolms wife, Betty Shabazz, is Angela Bassett, 
who is probably most known for her role inBoyz N the Hood. Albert 
Hall plays Baines, the man who introduced and steered Malcolm 
X toward the Islamic religion.
A] Freeman, Jr. portrays Elijah Muhammad, the controversial 
leader of the Nation of Islam. Delroy Lindo portrays West Indian 
Archie, the Harlem kingpin who schools Malcolm in the tricks of 
the hustling trade. Lee plays Malcolms pal, Shorty, during his 
criminal years. There were also cameo appearances by Nelson 
Mandela, Bobby Seale, Reverend A1 Sharpton, John Sayles, and 
Peter Boyle.
By any means necessary. This is the quote that Malcolm X is 
known for, if nothing else. If the purpose of Lees film was to show one phrase spoken by a great political leader.
that Malcolm X was a complex man who underwent many trans
formations in order to search for the truth, he succeeded.
Lee served as writer, director, and producer of this film. He 
combines history, drama, and a contemporary perspective. Any
one who is a fan of Lees films will see many similarities in humor 
as well as the cinematography.
Filmed on location in New York, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and South 
Africa, the film is designed in three parts. The first part covers 
Malcolms early years; the second covers his period of enlighten
ment in prison; and the third covers his development as an 
activist. Malcolm Xs widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz served as a 
creative consultant to the project.
There were no short cuts in this film. Every detail seemed 
meticulously taken care of, from the actors to music, choreogra
phy, and costumes. My companion and I commented on the fact 
that all characters bore great resemblance to their real life 
counterparts.
Every scene and each character was believable. Many bio
graphical films have been known to leave some skeletons in the 
closet, but everything rumored to be true about Malcolm X was 
either put to rest or was corrected on the screen, from his days as 
a criminal, his white lover, his stand on President Kennedys
assassination, controversial 
problems with the Nation of 
Islam, and travel to the Middle 
East.
This made the audience be
lieve that the film was realis
tic. Telling the story ofMalcolm 
X required representing 
America from the 1930s to the 
present.
Every time frame was well 
accounted for with the prop 
detailing down to an exact sci
ence. The scenes from the jour
ney to Mecca were breathtak
ing.
Also, there were several 
shots during the film of Mar
tin Luther King, Jr. and the 
upheaval of America during 
its civil rights movement. An 
added flare to the film was the portrayal of civil rights problems 
and footage ofMalcolm X himself in his many moods and interac
tion with people.
Malcolm X is an epic tale of a man whose words changed the 
world and ultimately declared that people of all colors could work 
and live together if they were of good will. This film is an effective 
tool for political statement.
It delves much deeper into who Malcolm X truly was instead of 
the quick quote, We declare our right on this Earth to be man, to 
be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given 
the rights of a human being, in this society, on this Earth, in this 
day, which we intend to bring into existence by any means 
necessary, that most Americans get in high school history courses 
and books.
After seeing this film, it is my hope that people will become more 
educated and acutely aware that by any means necessary is but

Copper BlueSugar
With his new band, Sugar, Bob 
Mould has revitalized both his 
music and career. His first band, 
Hiisker Dii, started out playing 
hardcore punk, but over the 
course of eight albums, they mi
grated towards slower songs with 
more distinctly pop-influenced 
melodies.
However, due to the bands in
ternal problems, Hiisker Dii 
broke up in 1987. In 1989, Mould 
released his first solo album, 
Workbook, in which he abandoned 
his electric guitar and created an 
album of thoughtful, acoustic 
pieces. His second solo album, 
Black Sheets of Rain, was released 
in 1990. It was lethargic and 
disappointing.
Copper Blue, on the other hand, 
is exceptionally good. Mould has 
continued in his tradition of writ
ing catchy pop songs backed by 
loud and heavy guitar riffs. But 
hes also managed to invest his 
new songs with an energy that 
his fans have not seen since 
Hiisker Dus New Day Rising. An 
important note to make here is 
that in this post-Nirvana world 
of hard rock (thinly disguised as 
alternative), Sugar is not a 
grunge band or anything remotely 
similar.
Tracks like Helpless and 
Changes contain obvious pop 
influences and are perhaps two 
of the most commercially-viable 
songs Mould has ever written. 
One song that has created a mi
nor controversy is A Good Idea, 
which many have pointed out as 
extremely reminiscent of the Pix
ies. Although I might hesitate in 
accusing Mould of stealing an
other bands melody, I have to
admit that the song does remind 
me vaguely of Doolittle-era Pix
ies. Although some may say that 
most of this album sounds ex
actly like his solo material or his 
later years with Hiisker Dii, I 
believe that this is true only to a 
certain extent. Without being 
completely derivative of his older 
material, Mould has created a 
very entertaining summary of 
his recent musical career in Cop
per Blue.

qualities but shouldnt fail to rec
ognize the other people out there 
who m ay think differentlywho 
may see cyberspace as an oppor
tunity for a computer program to 
control people and their minds. 
And what about the people who 
dont choose to be involved with 
cyberspace  will it be possible 
not to be involved or will the 
technology be so forceful that 
there wont be a choice  what 
will people think of anticyberspacies? Its an extremely 
subjective issue, which means 
that along with the wonderful 
qualities of a technological ad
vancement come risks as well. 
There could possibly be a point 
at which the risks presented by 
progress are no longer worth
taken by humanity. After all, who 
needs more information and who 
needs a faster paced life than we 
already have? Who wants credit

private lives than they already 
do? Who wants to function some
place where everyone can know 
anything  a computer knows 
everything and there is no such

Benedikt did a fantastic job of 
giving the audience food for 
thought  food for thought that 
may have a serious impact on 
our lives unless we decide what 
we value and how we want our 
future to exist. Cyberspace is an

the risers were moved in mechanically 
and provided continuity in the scenes, 
which, as you can imagine is very impor
tant in an eight-hour production.
Costumes were fantastic in their rep
resentation of the period, and the light
ing only had a few problems. Occasion
ally, when there was a group of people 
talking, only half of them were lit. This 
made it difficult to see who was involved 
in the scene.
The lighting problem only happened 
twice, therefore it didnt constitute too 
much of a problem, and I am sure they 
will work them out by the next play date.
The first four-hour part ended with 
things starting to look up for Nicholas, 
but they were by no means solved.
Everybody involved was fantastic; 
however, there were a few standouts. 
Alison Metcalf, who played Madame 
Mantalini, Phib, Mrs. Cutler, Miss 
Gazingi, and Mrs. Snawley, was so su
perb in every part that I often didnt 
realize it was the same person. If I werent 
being a unbiased reporter, I would de
clare my undying love and promise to 
follow her career for the rest of my life.
Wadsworth, as Newman Noggs, 
seemed so real to me that I felt I actually 
knew and understood him. Orion, the 
head of the Drama Department, was 
both charming and humorous as Mrs. 
Crummies and managed to be convinc
ing in the other parts she played.
Hollywood as Nicholas was so per
fectly cast that if one could have picked 
the actor to play the part from scratch, 
he would most likely have been the end 
result. Kate, as played by Rocha, was 
also very good. As I mentioned earlier, 
everyone was wonderful, but the actor 
who stood out the most was Mike Messer 
as Smike.
I realize that it is a lot easier to give 
credit to someone when they play a 
tragic figure, but he was absolutely 
amazing in his portrayal. Messer com
pletely embodied compassion, grace, and 
wit in a character that required those 
qualities to the utmost.
The second four-hour part was opened 
by a brief summary of what had taken 
place so far. It was acted and narrated 
so well that one could have conceivably 
missed the first part and still ergoyed 
the second part. It was to the point and 
yet all-inclusive. Brilliant. I assume they 
do this since the audience would nor
mally have a day break in between the 
two parts and this would refresh their 
memory.
The second half ran, if it is possible, 
better than the first. How the cast kept 
up the energy, I cant imagine. The reso
lution of the plot was effective, stun
ning, and surprised me, even though I 
had read the novel. It wasnt that I
didnt know what was going to happen, 
but it was so well done.
It is hard to say this and sound con
vincing without sounding ludicrous, but 
the ending did kind of drag a bit. I can 
imagino people who haven't soon the 
play, thinking to themselves that the 
ending was probably about six hours too 
long. That wasnt the problem. I cannot 
put my finger on what the problem was 
except to say that there were so many 
loose ends to be tied up by the plays end 
that maybe it just seemed too much.
I understand that it may be very hard 
to accept all of this praise and not think 
I am being overly biased. But, Ill be 
honest  I went with very low expecta
tions because it was going to be eight 
hours of my time, and I am used to short 
TV shows and movies.
I also realize that you probably wont 
even begin to understand the play by 
what I have written. There is just so 
much that I can cover; so much hap
pened that I could write indefinitely. 
Fortunately for everyone, I dont have 
that ability. The play did have some 
problems, which I touched on, but on 
the whole it was fantastic. Go see it. You 
wont be disappointed.
Nicholas Nickleby plays through Sat
urday, December 12, in the Kresge The

Spalding Gray conducts his own 
therapy session at Lepper lecture
By TINA L. URSO
Tartan Production Manager
If you were lucky enough to see Spalding Gray on Tuesday night 
in the Carnegie Lecture Hall, you experienced the wit and charm 
of a man who is able to use stories of his own life for subject matter, 
dissecting and analyzing them in public for everyone to hear. He 
has a way of showing us how to laugh at the light side of our lives 
as he exposes the dark parts of his own. Grays appearance was the 
Robert Lepper lecture sponsored by the Art Department.
It is very hard to say whether Grays appearance last Tuesday 
was a lecture, a monologue, or a piece of art; Grays work is 
extremely difficult to label. Part anecdotal lecturer, part public 
self-psychologist, part tragic stage hero, and possibly even part 
stand-up comedian, Gray exceeds the boundaries of the definable.
But who needs paltry boundaries anyway? What is definable is 
Grays enormous talent and wit, of which he has plenty, and his 
ability to make the entire audience feel as though we were his close 
confidants.Gray spent the evening telling us a story of how [he] 
came to tell stories. It was a personal adventure beginning in his 
childhood days in Rhode Island and more or less ending with his 
being in front of us that evening.
His story began in a Christian Scientist home from the WASP, 
country club part of town, where he was found to be mildly dyslexic 
and was considered slow in school. He didnt enjoy school very 
much, even had to repeat the seventh grade, and used to stay home 
a lot, telling his mother he was sick (he lightly added that his 
mother could never prove any different because they were Chris
tian Scientists).
He took solace in dreaming about becoming a race car driver and 
even tried to get into the vocational mechanics classes, which he 
said were meant for those from the other side of the tracks, lower 
class Italians, not for boys from his background. When he learned 
how to drive, he used to take the family car out with a friend and 
speed it along back roads. His dream was crushed forever when he 
got into a near-fatal accident that left the car with irretrievable 
damage, hanging over a sea-cliff wall.
After all of these problems, Grays father sent him away to a 
boarding school, which was ahead of his old school, requiring him 
to repeat ninth grade as well, but this ended up being an important 
event in his life. He decided to try out for the school play his junior 
year, but his nervousness and dyslexia at tryouts prevented him 
from getting the part. When he tried again his senior year, he got 
a part playing a mental patient, where the director allowed him to 
improvise, and this was the turning point where he finally found 
what he wanted to do in life. He went on to study liberal arts at 
Boston University because he didnt have enough experience to get 
into acting school, but soon transferred to Emerson College, where 
he got very involved with theatre, and where he later graduated. 
After graduation, he went on to work in regional theatre in Texas,
but he didnt like the atmosphere. When he wont homo, ho found his 
mother suffering from a nervous breakdown, and tried to take Caro 
of her for a whilo, but soon left with his girlfriend for Mexico, whoro 
thoy lived, out of touch with family and friends lor an ontiro 
summer.
When Gray came back in the fall, his mother was doad. She had 
asphyxiated herself in the garage. Ho could nover roully got ovor 
that, and it still haunts him. Much of what ho doos on the stage he 
describes as a therapy for this haunting" over his deceased mother, 
and is the major theme behind his latest book, Impossible Vacation.
He left home to try his luck with theater in Now York City, whoro 
he began to get a lot of roles after playing in a Thomas Paino play, 
and where he soon decided to go into underground theater. Ho got 
involved in various underground theater companies and began 
touring with them around America and the world. It was there ho 
was first able to do monologues, and it wasnt long before he broke 
off and began to do shows that were nothing but monologues of his 
own, the first of which was called Sex and Death to the Age 14. This 
would be the first of the monologues which made his personal style 
famous.
Gray mentioned that he doesnt actually keep up with much 
theatre thats going on nowadays. He said that he feels most stage 
actors today, with the exception of a few, like John Lithgow, act 
rather than be their parts, and that this sort of acting doesnt 
interest him at all. He attributes this loss of stage acting talent to 
the movie industry. He doesnt put down movie acting, he just puts 
it in a separate category from stage acting, saying the stage requires 
more projection but that the screen can be more personal. He 
believes most great actors today aim for the screen instead of the 
stage because there is more money and recognition in it.
After telling us this amazing story of his personal storytelling 
history, Gray opened the floor up to questions, which helped the 
audience feel an even closer affinity with him. Gray said his bottom 
line is sadness, and you definitely got a feeling for that by the end 
ofthe night; but he still, through all of it, managed to make me, and 
probably many others, laugh more than I had in a very long while. 
Its one ofthe many gifts hes been blessed with, I only wish he could 
share it more heartily with the rest of us.
Even though this may all sound a bit depressing, it wasnt. Gray 
managed to end on a positive note, and even ended up smiling once 
or twice before it was all over. He left me feeling happy but intensely 
aware of my own existence. Im glad to have been able to share an 
evening with such a wonderful person, and hope to see more from 
him in the future.
