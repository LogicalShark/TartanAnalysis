Intermission For Luncheon 
After Twelfth Dance 
At Midnight
ELLERTON TO LEAD
On the day before the largest social 
function of the year everyone is pre
pared for a grand and glorious time. 
Though the war has brought about, un
usual circumstances the affair is loom
ing up as one of Techs best Proms. 
The conditions have also caused the 
committee to do away with some of 
the smaller specialities but the bigger 
things will be there. The Rittenhouse 
ballroom will be nicely, decorated 
'though not elaborately, a light lunch
eon will be served and the musical 
program will be of the finest type.
Through a misunderstanding The 
Tartan stated that the intermission 
would come between the 15 and 16 
dances, but ,in order to have the lunch 
-served at midnight the intermission 
will be between the 12 and 13 dances. 
In order to avoid confusion the cominittee asks everyone to note the fol
low order of Promenade:
George Ellerton, Junior Class, 
President Science School.
R. P. Woodward, Junior Class, 
President Design School.
R. R. Willoughby, Chrm Prom. 
Com. and the committee in alpha
betic order.
President Science School.
President Design School.
President Senior Class Design 
School.
President Senior Class Science 
School.
Following this order the other danc-ers are urged to fall in in the best or
der possible.
The committee has the following 
Liberty Luncheon to offer for the 
^approval of those in attendance: 
Chicken Salad 
Sandwiches 
Olives and Pickles 
Caramel Nut Parfait 
Cake 
Coffee
The Tartan has been asked to state 
that there are to be no flowers or taxi 
.going to the dance. Also that everyone1 
co-operate with the committee in try
ing to make the affair the best yet.
CLUBS WELL RECEIVED 
IN LATROBE CONCERT
Last Sunday afternoon after short, 
snappy rehearsals, the insignia men 
of last year met for a few minutes and 
elected F. A. Faville as manager of the 
clubs for the remainder of this sea
son. Mr. Faville succeeds J. J. Pannabaker, who has left school. The 
election of Faville as manager left 
his position as Librarian of the Man
dolin Club vacant, and Mr. George 
Balaurie was elected. Both of these 
men have been exceptionally active in 
the clubs, so that no mistake was 
made in the selection of them as offi
cers.
The concert given at Latrobe on 
February 7 was pronounced as the 
best college glee club concert given 
there in years. The fellows had a 
splendid trip and the dance afterwards 
was very much appreciated.
The new manager has a list of con
certs in view such that if we succeed 
in landing only a small percentage of 
them, the remaining open dates of the 
season will be filled entirely. Con
certs at Youngstown. Warren (Ohio). 
Erie, Sewickley, Greensburg and 
Jeannette are in progress of arrange
ment, besides several local entertain
ments.
Now is the time when it takes the 
old pep to come steadily to rehears
al, but the ones' who come out con
sistently and work earnestly are the 
ones who help build up the clubs, and 
| they are the ones who will constitute 
I the men who are chosen for the com
ing trips.

TWO OFFERS SOLVE 
DIFFICULT PROBLEM
The problem of accommodating the 
great number of enlisted men that 
have come and are coming to Tech 
was practically splved with the ac
tion of the trustees of the Carnegie 
Institute and that of the Masonic Fund 
Society, of Allegheny county. , The 
trustees of the Carnegie library and 
institute have offered the use of (lie 
large kitchen and service facilities in 
the basement of that building for the 
mess quarters of the enlisted men. 
The housing of the men has been pro
vided for by the Masonic Fund So
ciety, which last week offered the use 
of the Masonic temple for this pur
pose. The latter offer has already been 
taken advantage of by the school au
thorities.
BASKETBALL TEAM MEETS DEFEAT THREE TIMES ON EASTERN TRIP
State and Swarthmore Have 
Easy TimeBucknell 
Hard Pressed
DOHERTY STARS
The Tech Basketball team invaded 
the East during the end of last week, 
playing Penn State, Bucknell and 
Swarthmore. On none of these occa
sions did the Plaid succeed in scoring 
a victory.
Coach McCullough took a squad of 
seven men, including Gretzler, Doherty, Lynn, Hoban, Cosgrove, Koefed 
and Kruse up to State College, Pa.,
. Thursday. They met the fast Blue 
and White team that night. Although 
the team fought hard, they were at 
no time in the running with their 
more experienced adversaries from 
the State College and lost to the tune 
of 46 to 19.
Wolfe and Wilson at the guards for 
State, were a stonewall during the 
first half. They held Tech to but 
one field goal, which was scored by 
Doherty during the first half, Captain 
Blakeslee at center and Young at for
ward were almost able to cage the 
ball at will for State. The Penn State 
team is probably the stiffest opponent 
that Tech has met this season.
Doc Doherty played an excellent 
floor game for Tech and also shot five 
field goals, as well as ten from the 
foul line. This showing is remark
able for a man of his size in view of 
the speed and size of the opposing 
guards. Acting Captain Gretzler met 
his match in Captain Blakeslee of

PLANS FOR RECREATION 
OF SOLDIERS ARRANGED
In order to make their brief stay in 
Pittsburgh as pleasant as possible to 
the soldiers who are taking the war 
courses at Tech, Dean Bossange, who 
is chairman of the committee in charge 
of the recreation of these enlisted 
men, has sent an appeal to civic and 
social organizations and churches in 
the city asking their co-operation in 
making arrangements. The commit
tee is anxious to provide one home 
meal for the soldiers on Sundays. The 
clubs, societies and churches have 
been asked to take up this matter with 
their members and parishioners to as
certain how many families would be 
willing to invite two or more men to 
dinner or supper Sundays. Dean Bos
sange is desirous of having this pro
gram carried out so that the soldiers 
may feel that they have been taken 
into the homes of Pittsburgh and wel
comed by the community in a personal 
manner. He asks assistance in plan
ning the wreekly entertainment to be 
given the men, and in establishing a 
club room in one of the Tech build
ings where the men may go every 
day to do their correspondence and 
spend their leisure hours.
GRAPOICA PRESIDENT 
LEAVES FOR SERVICE
At a special meeting of the Grapliica last week Clancy Dahl, president 
of the society tendered his resigna
tion in view of the fact that he ex
pects to be called for service in the 
Navy in which he enlisted recently. 
President Dahl was an Upper in the 
Department ofPrinting and has suc
cessfully conducted the affairs of the 
Graphica since the opening of school 
in September. F. T. Denman, vice 
president, will fill the office until the 
completion of the term.
The Club Room in the Science 
Building was closed Monday morning 
as a result of the deplorable condition 
of the furniture, which has been 
brought about by carelessness and im
proper use on the part of those -who 
frequent the room. Many instances of 
utter disregard of the rules of com
mon decency have occurred of late, 
and courteous requests that the room 
be properly used have been of no 
avail. Conditions have arrived at such 
a state that the Science Senate has 
been compelled to close the room until 
repairs and additions to the equip
ment can be made. In order that the 
club room may be speedily put in good 
condition, the annual assessment for 
that purpose will be called for at once. 
It is requested that all Science men 
respond promptly, and in that way 
help the Club Room Committee of the 
Senate in making the needed repairs.

The Ladies of Science Faculty:
It is hard for us at such a distance 
to express adequate appreciation for 
the most generous remembrances that 
were sent to us by the wives of the 
faculty of Science School. It is a 
source of great comfort to those of 
use that are over here to know that 
we are ever in the thoughts of the 
ones at home; and our life here is 
ever brightened by the constant ef
forts of the women at home who are 
bearing with us in the burdens of war 
for the existence of liberty and demo
cracy.
Please accept the thanks of all the 
boys of the Science School and myself 
for these tokens of co-operation which 
have been so generously sent to us. 
Most sincerely yours, 
CHARLES B. STANTON,

SOLDIERS SlEEPING 
ON COTS IN SCIENCE
Last week a large number of cots 
and mattresses were brought into 
Science building. They were placed 
in rooms 3, 4, 68, and 115. About 
25 soldiers arrived Friday and took 
possession of room 68. Quite a num
ber halve arrived since, and altogeth
er about 500 new men will have ar
rived in a few days. If there is not 
enough room for all of them in Sci
ence, the, overflow will bo placed in 
the Syrian Mosque, or the Soldiers 
Memorial Hall.
These men are enlisted In the Sig
nal Corps, and have come here to 
take a four months course in Radio 
work, the bulk of their work will ho 
in the repair and maintenance of radio 
apparatus. They are being trained to 
take care of the radio apparatus on 
aeroplanes.
INTERVIEW WITH MAJOR LYLE CLEARS DP DDDDTFDL POINTS
EIGHT WAD COURSES ARE 
NOW CONDUCTED AT TECD
The following war courses are now 
being conducted at Carnegie Tech:
WAR COURSE No. 1.
Radio and Buzzer Operation.
Threehundred ninety conscripted

registered in this course, which is 
held three evenings a week, three 
hours an evening, and calls for attend
ance of approximately two hundred 
hours.
WAR COURSE No. 2.

COURSE DETAILED
INDUSTRIES STUDENTS 
WANT GENERAL ASSEMBLY
Efforts are being made by the stu
dents of the School of Applied Indus
tries to obtain a period in the program 
when the Student; Assembly can bo 
held. Those meetings were out' out 
of the program in order to secure 
more time to aid In the speeding up 
of the courses. They always wore 
very interesting and much was ac
complished through them. At. a spec
ial meeting hold last Friday a .commit
tee composed of R. K. Morlcor, chair
man; .T. .T. Rudlslll and F. S. Boede 
was appointed to interview the prop
er authorities as to the possibilities 
of again having student, assemblies 
made a regular part of the schedule.
There seems to be some misunder
standing and doubt in the mind of the 
average student about military drill. 
Students do not realize the import
ance of drill nor do they realized the 
meaning of the designation Tech has 
received as an R. O. T. C.
In an interview with Major Lyle, 
many doubtful points were cleared up. 
The course in military tactics will be 
as long as the regular course in Tech 
and will treat the following points: 
elementary drill, school of soldier, 
squad, platoon company and batta
lion: musketry; bayonet fighting;
bombing; physical training; machine 
gun warfare; trench warfare; trench 
sighting; barbed wire entanglements; 
military engineering; map sketching; 
and reading; topography; open war
fare; ceremonials; guard duties; mil
itary law; military tactics and strat
egy: signaling; basser and irsual; 
sanitation and first aid.
The military department has the 
option of recommending any man 
leaving Tech for the army, Lor a, posi
tion In a Officers Training Camp. 
Any man graduating and having pass
ed at least two years of military drill 
in Xtech will be commissioned upon 
graduation.
The uniforms are to be of cotton 
I lchakl and are to bo worn at all times 
In school and on the campus. 11 is 
not necessary for a man to wear his 
I uniform when not in school. IJniI forms muat .be worn on the 25th of 
February.
There will bo no designation of of
ficers, but the plebes will bo distin
guished from the others by one hand 
of braid on their ajeoveq, instead ol! 
two. Canvas puttees are to be worn. 
The cap will bo plain finished and the 
Carneglo Thistle button Is to ho worn, 
on tho front; of the cap. R. O. T. 0. 
will ho worn on the collar. Also C.
I. T. pins will be worn there.
Major Lyle Is pleased with the at
titude and enthusiasm of the men.
The pride of the student body In It
self is necessary for the host results. 
With the proper co-operation, the stu
dents may fool assured that the .course 
given them will be the most, efficient: 
and thorough possible.
VOCATIONAL ADVISOR FOR STUDENTS OF DESIGN AND M. M. C. S. APPOINTED
NIGDT TECD DESIGN CLUD 
ENJOYS UNIQUE PARTY
Into the annals of the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology may be entered 
the fact that the day and night stu
dents have at last come together for 
an evenings pleasure and enjoyment. 
And what makes this event of more 
than passing interest is the fact that 
it was held under the auspices of the 
Nite Tech Design Club, the youngest 
club at; Tech, which has already 
achieved a reputation of doing things.
The attendance of about 60 couples 
more than exceeded the greatest ex
pectations of the committee. The 
president of the club has received 
many compliments on the enterprise, 
but feels that without the efficient 
committee appointed by the day and 
night students, the , success of the 
evening might be questionable. How
ever, he passes the credit to the fol
lowing men who constituted the com
mittee: day students: Charles Kleinfelder,  Brady McSwiggan and Fred 
Pelman; night students: Paul
Scihweinberg, Ray Simboll and tflie 
President Fred C. Wilharm.
At this time it may be stated, that 
all who were there were amply repaid 
for the nominal fee charged, whereas,

BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 
CLUB WILL HOLD DANCE
Miss Holmes to Aid Girls 
Seeking Employment
OPPORTUNITY GREAT
Plans are being made for one of 
the best dances given this season, to 
be held at the Union on Friday, March
l. The members of the Building Con
struction Club are .making 'elaborate 
preparations for their annual dance, 
which will be given at this time. The 
hard question of music has been set
tled and they expect to have one of 
the best. music making organizations 
obtainable, the Rittenhouse Orchestra.
A need that has long been felt in 
Tech is to be filled. Miss Marlon 
Holmes, now head of the Margaret 
Morrison Secretarial Department, has 
been persuaded by President I-Iamerschlag and by her own patriotic mo
tives, to accept the position of Em
ployment Secretary and , Vocational 
Advisor for Women in Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology. A years leave of 
absence has been granted to Miss 
Holmes, and at present, no act could 
be more patriotic: With so many men 
at work and In the camps, new posi
tions for women are opening every 
day, and to have some medium be
tween the position and the girl, will 
be the ideal outlet for the results of 
Techs training. Miss Holmes will 
have an office in the Central Build
ing, and will have both Margaret Morrison^and Design girls under her 
charge.
An an advisor, Miss Holmes will be 
particularly valuable, to the Plebes. 
She will meet students individually 
and in groups, giving them informa
tion regarding fields of work open to 
women, the training necessary to en
ter these fields, the emoluments, etc. 
She will help students who seem, to 
their department, to have . made a 
wrong choice.
To faculty committees,i Miss Holmes 
will give reports on types of work 
most called for, and will also, be in
formed regarding letters of inquiry 
that come from parents or from pros
pective students, asking for advice 
about courses or l!6r information about 
opportunities In various -fields. t ,
In regard to direct placement, Miss 
Holmes will seek to find penna-nent 
positions for Seniors apd; Graduates, 
and summer or temporary positions 
for students who must earn their tui
tion.

FRATERNITIES
Last Saturday morning the existence of an inter fraternity coun
cil was practically assured through the adoption of its constitution 
by the representatives of the recognized fraternities. It*now remains 
only for the fraternities to approve the action of their representa
tives and elect the members of the council which will be formally 
organized next Saturday. At the last meeting, also a more modern 
attitude was assured on the part of Tech fraternities when the coun
cil unanimously adopted a resolution approving the publication of 
fraternity news by the school paper.
Both these actions are of considerable importance, the former 
to the fraternities themselves and the latter to the student body in 
general. The students have previously had no way of becoming ac
quainted with the fraternities; that situation has caused here, as in 
other schools, an occasional misunderstanding of the purposes and 
ideals of fraternities, and has perhaps made them appear studiously 
secretive instead of merely secret. The lack of fra
ternity publicity can hardly be blamed directly upon the 
organizations themselves or upon The Tartan. Both side have been 
willing to remedy the situation, but both have been rather timid about 
starting. The Tartan because of some trouble in former years, the 
individual fraternities because no one of them wanted to act without 
knowing the attitude oi! the others. Consequently the remedy has 
had to wait for t<hc organization of an interfraternity council and 
their concerted action of last Saturday. Within a week or two we 
hope to have an editor appointed by each fraternity, and fraternity 
newsll regular feature of the paper.
The advantages of the council were apparent even at last Satur
days meeting in at least one matter. The representatives were able 
to share tlicir information in regard to the government war tax on 
fraternity dues and initiation fees. Ten per cent is charged on the 
total of the two whenever that total, minus the amount paid for pins, 
magazine subscriptoins, and so forth, exceeds $12 a year. And now 
the advantages of publicity are also apparent, for this information 
must reach not only those fraternities which are recognized in the 
council, but the others as well.We would suggest that a council similar to this be organized by 
the fraternities of the Industries School, and that, they adopt the 
same policy in regard lo publicity. Those actions will, in the long 
run, undoubtedly result in benefit both to themselves and to the 
school.
"EVERYBODYS DOING IT
Ohkngo, Feb. 17.Five thousand men will lie taken lYom Army 
cantonments and given special training in mechanical courses at the 
University of Illinois if the government accepts an offer made by the

M. M. C. S. WAR COURSE 
FOR STENOGRAPHERS
By the establishment of an inten
sive course for stenographers, Mar
garet. Morrison is taking an active 
part in the war work at Carnegie In
stitute. The course is under the su
pervision of a sub-committee compos
ed of the Margaret Morrison faculty 
with Miss Ethel Sturtevant as chair
man.
The class hours will be from S:30 to 
3:30 every day except Saturday and 
most of the time will be spent on 
shorthand and typewriting with five 
lectures a week on business principles 
including filing and indexing, corre
spondence, office appliances, etc.
This course of fifteen weeks, extend
ing from February 25 to June 7, is 
expected to train the students for fill
ing any of the openings in government 
organizations which are continually 
advertising for stenographers. The fee 
is only $10.00 for the 15 weeks.
Margaret. Morrison is fully equipped 
to take charge of 28 students in addi
tion to its regular enrollment and in 
order to insure the success of the 
course is making additions to the list 
of instructors.
Every \voman who has a high school 
education or its equivalent., should 
take advantage of this wonderful op
portunity for it is only by being prop
erly trained, that' any one can bo of 
service to the government. Any wom
an who takes this course can feel 
that, she is preparing herself for real 
service to her country.

of sense,
But. good men starve for want of im
pudence.  Dryden.
VALENTINE MEETING 
HELD BY THE Y. W. C. A.
Valentine Day came to have a new 
meaning for the girls who attended 
the meeting of the Y. W. C. A. Feb
ruary 14. This was under the guid
ance of Miss Browning, who also de
signed some unique little valentines 
for the party. These valentines each 
held a sunshine verse, and a drawing 
of the world surrounded by a chain of 
hearts carried out the idea at world 
fellowship.
Miss ' Marguerite Haldeman led the 
meeting in an able and interesting 
way. She told how Saint Valentine 
was an Irish priest who was so help
ful to everyone that the peasants re
membered him by celebrating his 
birthday every year. We can easily 
imagine that the red hearts so gen
erally used now on February 14, orig
inated from the symbol of kind-heart
edness. Misses Browning, Turkle, 
Benscoter and Field commented on 
some poem that had a lovely thought. 
Miss Browning held the close atten
tion of the girls while she told the 
story of Everybodys Lonesome. 
Several new songs were sung with a 
rousing spirit by the girls, Miss MeMarlin loading them.
An increase in attendance gives us 
a bright, outlook for the meetings that 
are to follow.

On Friday afternoon, a shattered 
Plebe team left East Liberty to play 
Kiski, who defeated them in an ex
cellent game 33-24. The following 
evening, Vandergrift nosed them out 
of a victory in a second extra fiveminute period by the 'score of 35.-38. 
Lynn could not accompany the five 
because he Nvas with the varsity 
squad. Bieber, who has starred at 
center and on the foul line all season, 
and Lind, our reserve center, were 
both declared inelligible because of 
poor work in their studies.
At Kiski, the game was exceptional
ly fast, especially during the first half, 
during which we gained a 17-10 lead. 
Riblett caged five field goals during 
this period which, together with Hammans field goal and Nichols five suc
cessful attempts out of seven on the 
foul line, brought our tally to seven
teen. Clawson, Ivisld's center, drop
ped in two field goals and caged four 
out of seven fouls. A field goal of 
Davies, their star forward, brought 
Kiskis tally to ten.
Kiski came back in the second half 
determined to do or die. Nearly all 
the players are on the football squad 
and are heavier than our men. Their 
weight told on us soon, however, and 
we were finally beaten. Maurer made 
our only field goal and Nichol again 
scored five out of seven foul goals.
Clawson starred for Kiski during 
the second period. He caged four field 
goals and nine out of ten fouls. Holleran, Ewing and Reid each dropped 
in a field goal thus bringing their tal
ly up to 33.
Our Plebes deserve all possible cred
it for their excellent showing against 
Kiski, who defeated the Pitt Fresliies 
the week before by the close score of 
33-35. Ribletts record of five field 
goals in the first period shows the ex
cellent style of ball be played. Hamman, the Plebe Captain, held the cen
ter position in fine style. He has not 
jumped center for three years but 
Clawson found quite a bit of difficul
ty in getting the jump, which, of 
course, hindered any successful work
ing of signals.
A feature of the game was a jump 
Hamman made for the Kiski baslcet 
as the ball was about to come through. 
He succeeded in knocking the ball 
right out of the basket. This counted 
as a double foul which Clawson made 
count. Nevertheless, Kiski had to 
work doubly hard for these two points, 
thanks to Hamman. Nichol did fine 
work on the foul line.
The floor at Kiski has no out of 
bounds. This was one reason for the 
fastness of the game. Referee Stayer 
also added to the speed of the game 
by his fast work on the field. His 
failure to call all the fouls made, caus
ed some dissatisfaction, however. Kis
kis reception of our team was very 
fine and there are hopes of seeing 
them at Tecli, possibly this season.
The game at Vandergrift started at 
ten oclock following a roller skating 
session. The floor was a very hard 
one for a team to play on, which had 
not. done some practising there. A 
very low ceiling and a slipery floor al
so set our men at. a disadvantage.
The first period ended 15-12 in favor 
of Vandergrift High. The Plebes went 
back in the second half determined to 
do their best. They easily tied the 
score hut Vandergrift continually fol
lowed them till the end of the second 
half when the score stood at 30-30.
At the end of the first extra five 
minute period, the score was still tied 
at 33-33. Hard luck in the last, extra 
period caused uS to lose by three 
points, 35-38. Much running with the 
ball and holding was allowed to pass 
uncalled.
Riblett again starred for Tech in 
this game. He caged seven out of 
the fourteen field goals made by our 
men. Hamman scored five and Maur
er two, one of which was a sensation
al long shot, which brought the Van
dergrift High boys to their feet. The 
fact that our team caged fourteen field 
goals while their opponents only got 
eleven seems pretty good evidence 
that our men were the better basket
ball players after all. Twenty-six fouls 
were called on our men. Karl Watt 
made sixteen of them count.
Fresch was out of the game this 
time and Paul took his position at 
forward, which he held down in fine 
style. Karl Watt starred for Vander
grift. He scored twenty-six of their 
thirty-eight points.

The total result of the College Y. 
M. C. A. campaign in which Tech 
took part during last sem'ester is ex
plained in the following letter from 
the chairman of the Student Council 
of North America:
February 2, 1918. 
President A. Hamerschlag, LL. D.,
Carenegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
My Dear President Hamerschlag:
One of the most encouraging and 
significant facts in connection with 
the life of the American universities 
and colleges in recent years has been 
the remarkable response of the stu
dents and professors in connection 
with the movement known as the Stu
dent Friendship Fund. I understand 
that there has been over $1,500,000 
provided by them toward meeting 
needs and opportunities occasioned by 
the war. Through countless letters 
and oral reports I have been impress
ed with the truly patriotic and sacri
ficial character of this notable mani
festation. You will agree that it con
stitutes a most gratifying evidence of 
the desire among students to serve in 
the highest way the nation and the 
world.
You have recognized the restless
ness on the part of many students and 
their desire to be of the largest ser
vice to the country; but you also, 
doubtless, believe in the importance 
of their continuing steadfastly in their 
regular courses. The leaders of our 
Government have at times expressed 
themselves strongly to me as to the 
importance of holding students to 
their regular work in order that they 
may be prepared to meet the larger 
demands which will inevitably be 
made upon them in the not distant 
future. At the recent international 
Student Conference, held at Northfield, where there was present a most 
representative company of students 
and professors, a constructive pro
gram was outlined and projected. It 
was designed to help prepare students 
for rendering the largest service in 
the years right before us. It likewise 
sounds the call to them dedicate their 
lives to. the vitally important task of 
helping to make a. new world accord
ing to th ideals of Christ. As a; means 
of realizing these high ends there has 
been projected by the Christian Stu
dent Movement a campaign for the 
promotion of voluntary study and dis
cussion of the principles of Christ 
and of the application of these prin
ciples to our national and internation
al problems. It is believed that this 
will accomplish great good in stimu
lating independent thinking and un
selfish action on the part of those 
who tomorrow must have such a large 
part in the leadership of the forces of 
righteousness and unselfishness.
I am sure that you will be glad to 
do anything in your power to strength
en the desire and purpose of leading 
students in your institution in their 
work of organizing informal groups 
foi' the study of these vital questions, 
and to encourage professors to give 
such time, outside their class-room 
work, as may be needed to help in 
guiding undergraduates in their con
clusive thinking.
Very sincerely yours,
J. R. MOTT.

COUNCIL DECIDES ON 
HANDBOOK AND RINGS
The most important matter discuss
ed at the last meeting of the Student 
Council was what designation should 
be used for the Plebes; now that the 
Plebe hat has been replaced by the 
cap of the uniform. A number of 
suggestions were brought forward, but 
no decision has as yet been reached. 
Major Lyle has suggested that Plebes 
wear one band of braid instead of two 
on their arm.
The committee on Student Hand
books reported the revision of the 
Handbook will soon be finished, and 
that the new edition will be printed in 
the summer.
All arrangements have been com
pleted for the Seniors rings. The 
ring which was used last year by Sci
ence and Design as their Senior ring 
has been adopted as the Tech Alumni 
ring. Any Senior in any of the four 
schools may buy the ring in the sec
ond half of the Senior year. The sales
man was here taking orders last week 
and the rings will arrive in 5 or 6 
weeks.

Y. W. C. A. WORKERS TO 
LEAD MEETING AT TECH
The girls of the Y. W. C. A. feel 
honored to have Dr. and Mrs. MacGowan of the Bellefield Presbyterian 
Church as their guests at the War 
Work Meeting Thursday. Dr.. Mac
Gowan has been working with' the 
boys of Camp Lee, while his wife had 
charge of a hostess house there. All 
the girl are anxious to hear so direct
ly about the life and interests of the 
soldier boys of Pittsburgh. ,
Hot chocolate will be served at the 
Y. W. meetings every week/ with'the 
charge of two cups for five cents.
The girls of the new Margaret Mor
rison Dormitory at 5052 Forbes street, 
entertained their faculty, friends, and 
fellow school mates (Saturday after
noon. They are justly proud of their 
new home and the guests showed a 
lively interest in it, the rooms being 
demonstrated to the best advantage 
by the girls, who acted as touring 
guides. Tea, coffee, and cakes Avere 
served in the dining room, the faculty 
members Misses Hyde, Browning, 
Pope, Sibley, Parry, Davidson, and 
Mrs. Vermorcken assisted at pouring. 
The girls were also glad to have their 
former chaperone, Mrs. Everhart,| as
sist them.
The library, halls, and sun parlor 
were filled with guests, many khaki 
uniforms being in evidence; the draw
ing room was utilized for social danc
ing which attracted many. In addi
tion, the musical program so kindly 
given was thoroughly enjoyed by all 
present. This trio from the School of 
Applied Design and social selections 
by Miss Phyllis Mac Marlin of M. M.
S., accompanied by her sister. The 
solo "Keep the Home Fires Burning, 
proved especially popular, the guestsall joining spontaneously in the 
chorus.
The success of the altair is due to 
the co-operating in committee work 
of .each girl in the dormitory. Special 
credit is due to Lulu Fuller, Dorothy 
Davis and Charlotte Miller for their 
efficient work in handling committees 
and affairs in general.
The house dance held in the even
ing was no less a success. The open
ing dance, a grand march, was a novel 
feature enjoyed by all. The music 
was furnished by Sweeney and Bar
rows and was fine, as usual. During 
intermission sandwiches, cakes and 
coffee were served and empty plates 
bore mute testimony that they were 
enjoyed. The dining room, lighted by 
candles, furnished an attractive room 
for dancing. The girls especially ap
preciate the valiant efforts of the ifien 
who helped in the struggle of putting 
rugs and furniture back in place. The 
first house dance is now only a pleas
ant memory, but heres hoping there 
will be many repitions.

Bucknell defeated Tech 45 to 32 Fri
day night in Lewisburg. Pa. The game 
was declared by the Bucknell rooters 
to be one of the best ever staged on 
their floor. So fast and clean was the 
work of our squad, that they had the 
entire feminine rooting section sup
porting them before the end of the 
first half.
From a Tech standpoint the game 
was a heart breaker. The Plaid led 
Bucknell by the score of 23 to 21 at 
the end of the first half and maintain
ed a slight lead up to the last five 
minutes of play. At this time the 
Bucknell forwards started dropping 
the ball through the net from every 
angle and part of the floor with sen
sational shots.
Doherty starred for Tech, but was 
hurt early in the second half and his 
playing was thus greatly retarded. 
His floor work was especially good in 
view of the peculiar cage arrangement 
of the Bucknell court. The work of 
ex-Captain Left Abrams was greatly 
missed in this contest.
Mathieson led the scoring for Buck
nell with seven field goals, many of 
which were very long. The entire 
Bucknell team played well and had 
finely co-ordinated team play. The 
passing of the Bucknell team was ex
cellent and they used the peculiar 
floor arrangement to unusual advan
tage by banking their passes against 
the cages at the ends of the floor.

The Plaid was unable to stop 
Swartlimores winning streak Satur
day night and was downed by the 
score of 3G to 18. Captain Donnelly 
led his speedy Garnet aggregation to 
an easy victory. Although Tech fought 
hard throughout the contest, they 
were outclassed and the strain of the 
two previous games told on their 
speed on the floor.
Swarthmore jumped into the lead in 
the first few minutes of play and at 
no time olter that were they endan
gered by Tech. Donnelly at guard Cor 
Swarthmore broke through on six oc
casions to cage field goals. Yoder at. 
forward was accountable for five of 
the Garnet scores.
For Tech Lynn and Hoban played 
well. Doherty was hampered by sore
ness from his injury sustained in the 
Bucknell game. Gretzler played a 
consistent, game and contrived to 
shoot two field goals.
This victory was the third consecu
tive one for Swarthmore, whose team 
is rated as one of the foremost, in 
Eastern Pennsylvania this winter.

The regular meeting of the Carnegie 
Mechanical Engineers Society, held 
on last Wednesday evening, was well 
attended, and the lecture proved very 
interesting as well as instructive. Mr. 
W. C. Wright of the National Found
ers Association, was the speaker of 
the evening. His topic was "Modern 
Foundry Methods and Equipment, 
and his talk was illustrated by five 
reels of excellent motion pictures tak
en in foundries throughout the coun
try which make a specialty of rapid 
production work. Every picture show
ed a distant advantage gained by the 
use of molding mochines and other 
rapid production machinery in the 
foundry.
President Obert announced the fol
lowing committee to act on the C. M.
E. S. banquet: Messrs. Eaton, Baronner, and McKee. The annual banquet 
will be held the latter part-of April, 
and it is - earnestly requested that 
every Mechanical Engineer student 
and every Mechanical graduate make 
provision to be present.

Monday of this week, Dean Breed, 
discussed the possibility of organizing 
a Tech Agricultural Unit at Camp 
Louise Carnegie where 750 acres of 
land are available. The agricultural 
work done last summer by Bryn Mawr 
girls was cited and it was suggested 
that those girls who were interested 
consult Miss Coleman about future 
plans. The question of continuing 
school throughout the summer was al
so discussed, and while the nature of 
the courses offered has not been de
termined it is quite possible that spec
ial war courses will be given. The 
"Thrift Stamp drive has been car
ried on very successfully by the M. 
M. C. S. girls but in order to better 
organize the work it was decided to 
elect a general chairman who should 
appoint, captains over groups of twen
ty girls and thus organize the student 
body into teams. Charlotte Tross and 
Helen Senn were nominated, election 
to be held at. the next assembly. Doan 
Breed also spoke of the extensive 
plans that are being made to enter

At. a special mooting of the Execu
tive Commit too of the. Studont Assem
bly Harry C. Zehfuss was appointed 
to the Board of Control to fill the 
placo vacated by Louis V. Yeager. 
Lind was appointed secretary for the 
remainder of the term.
A plan is being worked out by a 
committee composed of II. Zehfuss, 
chairman; J. J. Rudislll, H. S. Yergey, and F. C. Beede by which Indus
tries may have an Honor Roll. This 
roll will bo made up of the students 
who have given up their regular 
courses to enter the service of the 
government. A large number of men 
from Industries have answered the 
call and It Is expected that the roll 
will be of considerable length.
(Continued From Page One.) 
those that did not, make their appear
ance, may feel that they have miss
ed one of the most delightful even
ings of their time as attested to by 
those that were present.
Among the many ovents of the even
ing, Mr. De Salieres of the Depart
ment of Sculpture spoke. 1-Ie express
ed his appreciation by stating that it 
brought back reflections of his school 
days when he enjoyed the Bohemian 
nights with his foliow-sl.udents in 
Paris. Messrs. Sparks and Hugo laud
ed the committee and co-workers as 
having furnished the best evening, in 
the history of Tech. Mr. Sparks also 
furnished us with a song which was 
enjoyed, by all present.
Mr, Harvey Rutter gave a. ballet 
dance. This was very well done when 
if. Is considered that on account of the 
large number in attendance, It did 
not allow him much room to perform.
Mr. Leonard of Lhe Department, of 
Architecture, who was in attendance 
with his wife, both enjoyed them
selves. Mr. 1. Burns, who is wellknow at. Tech for Ills benevolent 
works, needs no introduction, spoke 
and expressed his appreciation for be
ing present.
Special credit is extended to Miss 
Anna Georg for her singing. Miss 
Georg came as a gust and had no in
tentions of doing anything, excepting, 
as, insofar becomes a guest, but, on 
being asked by one of the committee, 
she consented. Miss Georgs singing 
alone was worth coming to hear and 
those not in attendance missed a rare 
treat.
Messrs. Anderson and Schweinberg 
played a little. farce drama entitled: 
I dont want to get well. This was 
very unique and well enjoyed.
The president would like to have all 
who had the sale of tickets in hand 
to report at the earliest possible time, 
making returns of tickets and all 
money so that a report may be hand
ed to the club. Also expenditures 
should be reported.
All who have had a hand in this ven
ture feel that there should be more 
of these, because of the fact that this 
was conducted on short notice, low 
cost of admission, and the acclama: 
tion of both day and night students 
and faculty.
Furthermore, this is the first time 
in the history of Tech that day and 
night students have -co-operated and 
prior to the occasion, the president 
has issued word that such a venture 
had been attempted before and always 
failed. Therefore, the Nite Tech De
sign Club members may be proud of 
the fact that they hold membership 
in a club that does things for the in
terest of its members, the school and 
their Alma Mater.

SECOND SHILLING BOARD 
HOLDS FIRST MEETING
The first meeting of the new Shil
ling Board wan held Friday, February 
15. The meeting was not a success 
from a standpoint of attendance. The 
new staff should realize that if they 
want to exceed the last'Shilling they 
will have to hustle. One way to ac
complish this is to attend the weekly 
hoard meetings. This board has the 
opportunity of profiting by the mis
takes of the previous board. There
fore, many of the new members can 
contribute the knowledge obtained in 
their English Minn, classes. There' 
is no obstacle in the Ayay of putting 
forth a Shilling which will surpass all 
previous issues.
The new board consists of Helen 
Clark, Dorothy Davis and Inna Fried
man from the Home Arts and Crafts 
Department; Secretarial Marie Fredette Anna McCandless and Frances 
Roberts; Social Work, Blanche Shep
pard, Louise Friedman and Katherine 
Kirk. Miss Parry will again act as 
faculty adviser and Lucy Hart as Secretary-Treasurer. The Plebe represen
tative has as yet not been elected.
The next Shilling will be issued in 
April.

BASEBALL SCHEDULE 
PLANNED FOR SPRING
COUNCIL RECOMMENDS 
QUIET COMMENCEMENT
The Educational Committee of the 
Administrative Council has made the 
recommendation that the usual Com
mencement Exercises and social func
tions be omitted this year for the fol
lowing reasons: (1) A large number
of Seniors will leave Pittsburgh dur
ing May at the completion of their 
shortened schedules; (2) It is desir
able that the administrative and in
structional staffs should have as much 
time as possible to devote to the in
creasing number of war courses; (3) 
Social functions should be modified 
or eliminated as a conservation meas
ure. The Council voted to recommend 
that this matter be referred to the 
All-Schools Committee on Public Oc
casions in order that faculty and stu
dent sentiment might be secured as a 
basis for a decision.
Considerable difficulty is being in
curred in obtaining a satisfactory 
baseball schedule for this spring. 
About eight games had been scheduled 
in spite of the fact that most of the 
larger Western Pennsylvania institu
tions were dropping this sport. This 
schedule included an. Eastern trip, 
which was later forced to be dropped 
by the action of the Faculty. Grad
uate Manager Eyman is working hard 
to book enough other games to fill the 
card and make up for this handicap.
The prospects of tile arrival of largoi increments of troops at Tech for 
training and the accompanying prob
ability of an early closing of school 
make it rather doubtful as to whether 
spring sports will be able to get under 
way. All contracts for games for all 
sports are being made with a Avar 
clause providing for the cancellation 
of contests without any forfeit in such 
a contingency.
TECH VS. WESTMINSTER 
AT GYM SATURDAY NIGHT
; ::-W
C<'
Next . Saturday evening, February 
23, the varsity will play Westminister 
on our floor at the gym. This game 
has just been arranged and is there
fore not on the schedule issued ear
lier in the season.
Negotiations are now being made 
for a. preliminary game with Kiski 
who had a hard battle against our 
Plebes last Friday evening, when they 
took the trip to Saltsburg.
Westminister's lineup will no doubt 
consist of Loghrie and Weirman at 
forward, Cummings and Lewis at 
guard and Armstrong playing center. 
Doherty and Lynn will most likely 
start, for Tech at forward. Hob,an will 
be held in reserve. The center posi
tion will be hold by Grot/,," as usual, 
and Cosgrove and Koefed will play 
guard. I
There ought, to be a larger crowd 
out to see these two contests, not only 
because they will both bo extremely 
fast, but because the team NEEDS 
j SUPPORT, and it will not GET IT un
less YOU contribute. Therefore be 
I at the gym next Friday evening at 
17:30 sharp and bring someone with 
I you.
MEN URGED TO COME 
OUT FOR TRACK SQUAD
The track squad is progressing at a 
fair rate due to the constant plugging 
of Coach Eyman in the matter of get
ting material. The squad was aug
mented during the past week with 
eight or nine new men. Everybody 
should try his luck at track. Material 
is needed if the school expects to have 
a good squad.
The gym floor will now be free for 
the track team Wednesday and Friday 
at 4:30- and Saturday at 10:00. On 
Mondays the special exercise room 
will be open for indoor work. The 
cinder track will be available in a 
short time if the good -weather continues.
