Laet Thursday evening in the 
Tech gym, the &kibo passer featcd the Geneva quintet by tli score of 34 to 29,-^Throughout tit encounter the Tartans led thei' opponents without' any apparent effort, until the later part of the second half when the Ctfvena drew .up within two points o leading Scotch twice. This Is the second win oC the Tartans in-seven starts, andthis Is the second time that 'the varBity five have played as a whole, the first being our initial game..with Pitt. The game was marked by the lack of substitu
tions, and the Carnegie five.--remained Intact until the latter plart of the second half, when Amans was forced out becausc of personals, and Lynch because'of disa
bilities.The game started off with au unusual snap; the Carnegie-basketeers unloslng  ferocious attack which netted them 17 points wit ' their seemingly dazed \pponei annexed thrfe. Amans drew Ai blood for the victors, .by dropping in a field goal, .whlcli was cl followed by one from Lynch.

Appearances may be against the modem

may sound a bit blotto, slinging his six or 
seven slanguages, including the Scandi

, lend him your ears. 'For thats one subject

. Listen to his learned lingo and,you'll see 
why the one perfect pipe tobacco is grand 
old Granger Rough Cut. It's all spicy old 
Burley, the choicest pipe tobacco known 
to man... all mellowed Wellman's way.. 
and cut, especially Jpr pipes, in large slow* 
burning, cool'smoking flakes. It's breaking 
all collegiate records for pipe^popularity.
Of course, some collegiate pipes, who 
judge everything von priced cant afford to 
smoke Granger.... it's too Inexpensive. 
But notice any pipe, that is sufficiently

notice so his Granger.

HIS picture, taken, in the salt marshes near 
Kearny* N. J., shows two lines of 30-inch Ca6t Iron Pipe replacing pipe made of othermaterial.
'The alternate exposure to the action of 6alt water 
and air is a 6evere te$t. 
While the pipe shown in the picture is subjected to 
unusual corrosivc influences all underground pipemust be able to withstand corrosion to a greater or - lessdegree. Cast Iron Pipe has this quality. It does 
not'depend on its coating to resist rust; the material 
itielf is rust-resisting. The first Cast Iron Pipe ever 
laid is in service today at Versailles, France, after 
two hundred.and sixty years' service. -

I TOOK P. A. fof better or worse .  , and 
found it better! Better than anything I had 
ever smoked. Thats my story and I*m going 
to stick to it. When siren-brands try to flirt, I 
just give them the Frigidstaire. I know what 1 
like in a pipe, and what 1 like is Prince Albert!
The instant you break the seal on the tidy red 
tin and get that wonderful fragrance of real 
tobacco, you know you are in for a pipe-treat. 
Your mouth fairly waters for a taste of tobacco 
that smells as good as that. Then you load up 
and light upah! .  .
Cool. Sweet. Fragrant. Old words, Ill ad
mit, but you get a brand-new idea of how much 
they can meah in a pipe-bowl packed with P. A. 
Maybe youve always thought such plpe-pleasure was "just around the corner. Try a load 
of Prince Albert and turn that comer!

Timken Bearings
In tlie epic history of the railroads a new 
chapter opens. Cars regularly equipped with 
anti-friction bearings are here. Timken 
Bearings make it pssible. Th first standard 
Timken-equipped cars go into operation on 
the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul.
Timken Tapered Roller Bearings for this 
-progressive railroads crack flyers,THE :LVDSAHE 
and U.R NAYERRT 0ADAiRQB mark the day of new 
ease, quiet arid surety in long distance travel.
On guard against the wear and'waste of 
friction, Timken Tapered Roller Bearings not 
only conserve power, but put an end to hot 
boxes and the whole'lubrication difficulty.
Steel wheels speeding steel grades and curves 
cause stresses which have been thought beyond 
anti-friction bearings. Here again, as in every 
other type of mechanism, throughout Industry, 
the impossible has yielded to Timken 
design, construction, and resources.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
This is our annual Advertising Issue of the 
Tartan." To give the student body the ben
efits of good advertising, ihc knowledge of 
where to go when you buy, and of what to buy 
when you get tliere, wcjiavc decided to give 
ADVERTISING the important place in todayJs 
issue. Some of our regular editorial page 
features have been omitted this week, but thej* 
will be resumed upon the next appearance of 
the Tartan. May wc add, patronize our 
advertisers.
In last weeks Tartan, under thc;eaption
are, and was inclined to conclude thtit improve
ment caDJpuigus and exhortation were futilo 
unless the whole scheme oi things would be 
changed. The solution is a matter of en
trance requirements and curriculue making.-
Since the publishing of this editorial, several 
students have volunteered to interpret the va
rious Carnegie Colleges in tlie light of the edi
tor^ generalizations. They will document the 
Carnegie of 192G-27, writing down things as 
they observe them, agreeing or disagreeing 
with prevailing opinion as the case may bc. 
It is the hope of the editors that Carnegie 
under the searchlight will be a stimulating 
proceeding for the entire student body, as it 
will undoubtedly be for the writers. r'*
In the Tartan of February 22, the first of 
these essays will appear; the vcontribulor will 
be from Art School.

there was present lierc a certain medioi

His text-book was

factsforhisthesis 
in 1918, he was 
only following a 
lifelong Habit. 
From the time hewas old 
etiought to delight in the shrill 
whistle of a locomotive, chraugii 
his'-student days af California 
Inscicute of Technology, the 
 most fascinating thing in the 
vvoYld to him was a railroad train.
1 It isnt just happy chance that, 
at 29, he-is a Sales Engineer in 
the Transportation" Division of 
the Wesringhou$e, Company, at 
Philadelphia. And it was quite 
natural that Bercaw should have 
an important share in the ne
gotiations.involving, one ofNthe 
most1 revolutionary transportar 
don developments of the century 
 the ^development of th gasclectric rari car. -
This design proyices. locomotion 'widn the passenger car.
itself. So on many branch lines 
locomotives can be discarded' 
with great saving to railroad 
companies and with .increased 
convenience to passengers.
But to perfect this -flew car 
required thorough cooperation' 
be.tween the Wes.tinghouse arid 
Brill .Companies, whose engi
neers supplied, respectively, the 
electric generator and gas engine 
which, combined, .give this-car 
its practical advantages. Bercaw 
acted as a liaison man during' 
this development stage, ^nd
----- he is \ngaged in selling,
among ^ther things, these cars 
representing the newest idea in 
railroad transportation.
When Bercaw entered the 
Graduate Students Course at 
East Pittsburgh in May, 1919, 
Ke ^as fresfi from collegeand 
naval aviation'. ' His enthusiasm 
for railroading was not allowed 
to cool-he wasnt shunted into 
unfamiliar, lines. For thirteen 
months he was a student in the 
Railway Shops. Then for six 
months in th^ General Engineer
ing Department ,h learned'how 
to apply Westinghduse Equip
ment to railroad needs. It was a 
logical step next to the Heavy 
Traction Division of the Sales 
Department at East Pittsburgh. 
And two ,and a-KSl? years there' 
landed him in his important 
work in Philadelphia.
. To men who find a railroad 
train fascinating, Westinghouse  
opens', a field that has unlimited 
opportunities for' success. :
