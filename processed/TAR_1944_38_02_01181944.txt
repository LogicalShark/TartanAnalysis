Inspector Generals 
Department Visits 
Carnegie ASTU
Throughout the entire day last 
Tuesday, January 11, the Carnegie 
Tech A.S.T.P. unit underwent a 
thorough inspection by Major Webb, 
who was assisted by Warrant Of
ficer (j.g.) Zeller. These men are 
inspectors for the entire Third Ser
vice Command and made here the 
annual routine inspection which 
Army regulations require.
In the military office itself they 
examined all personnel and service 
records and checked on the unit 
fund. (This fund, incidentally, is 
to be used for the benefit of the 
entire unit, and any reasonable 
suggestions concerning its use will 
be carefully considered.)
During the noon hour an inter
view period was held open for 
comments, suggestions, and criti
cism from the men of this unit.
Accompanied by Lt. Dyer, the 
Supply Officer, the inspectors ex
amined the Infirmary, the housing, 
,the mess and the available fa
cilities. Major Webb said that liv
ing quarters here are much better 
than those in most of the other 
schools which he has visited and 
that the Mess Hall seems quite 
clean and well-staffed. He also re
marked that the supply room is 
more lenient in regard to salvage 
and supply than one at a regular 
post would be. Aside from these 
remarks, he made no definite com
ment. As is customary, the full re
port is due later from the Third 
Service Command at Baltimore.
Tau Delt Invitation 
Dance Huge Success
Hotel William Penn was blessed 
Saturday with over three hundred 
Tech men, maybe half as many 
Tech women, and a representative 
group of gals from all over towil at 
a dance that started at nine and 
lasted until the orchestra walked 
out at one. Tau Delt went all out 
and more than trebled the attend
ance of the only previous attempt at 
a just-short-of-formal invitation 
dance. It is hoped the other fra
ternities will follow the lead. Joey 
Simms did a swell job on the music; 
One Oclock Jump sounded al
most as good as Harry James.
Along in the evening Burt Faigen 
.gave a welcoming speech, which 
was followed by a conga line that 
accumulated over two hundrel peo
ple before the end of the number. 
The affair certainly lived up to 
expectations.
\
Members of the student body 
are reminded that all pledges 
made during the recent United 
War Fund drive are overdue and 
should be paid at the cashiers of
fice, 160 Administration Hall.
The Committee has pledged the 
student subscriptions and wiU 
appreciate their prompt pay
ment. *

Japanese Hold Larry Coulter, 40; 
His Friends Are Urged To Write
Out of the war in the East comes 
one of those strange tales of joy 
with overtones of heartache. The 
story began on July 29, 1941, when 
Larry Coulter, who was graduated 
from the Music Department in 1940, 
enlisted as an Aviation Cadet in
the Naval Air Corps. In May of the 
next year he received his wings at 
the Naval Reserve Air Base in 
Philadelphia, and was promoted to 
the rank of Naval Flying Officer at 
the U. S. Naval Air Station at Jack
sonville, Florida. As a reward for 
rating first in a test given to 200 
pilots, he flew a bomber across the 
Pacific to Pearl Harbor. In August 
of the same year he took part in the 
initial Battle of the Solomons.
On September 6, 1942, Ensign 
Coulters plane with the assistance 
of another patrol plane severely 
damaged, and probably destroyed, a 
Japanese four-engined bomber. On 
September 11 he was reported miss
ing after his plane, which had been 
fired upon by numerous Japanese 
fighters, was seen going down in 
flames. His family received word 
that he was missing in November; 
they heard no more about him until 
March, 1943, when they received a 
citation and the Air Medal which 
had been awarded to Ensign Coul
ter by President Roosevelt.
Some months later a man in the 
state of Washington heard Larry 
Coulter on a short wave broadcast
CWCA To Hold Installatb *
Setting January 24 as the date, 
the CWCA will open the new se
mester with the first of its regular 
monthly dinner meetings. According 
to newly-elected President Clem 
McKenna, the Monday get-together 
will mark the installation of the new 
cabinet. It will be at 5:00 in the 
Union.
Co-Chairwomen Jean Norris and 
Lucille Emmel have announced that 
the annual social event promises to 
be a highly impressive affair with 
the old cabinet giving up the duties 
of office to the new officers.
from Tokyo; he called the family in 
Monongahela City and sent them a 
recording he had made of the broad
cast. In the broadcast Larry had 
sent a message to his mother and 
one to his father. These messages 
made the family absolutely sure 
that the American prisoner who had 
broadcast was Larry, for he refer
red to a family joke in the message 
to his mother and in the message to 
his father he talked in a code of 
baseball language that he and his 
father had invented before he left. 
The Coulters wrote to their son, but 
the letter was returned because it 
didnt comply with the relgulations 
the Japanese Government had made 
concerning prisoners mail.
Some time after this, other people 
on the West Coast wrote to the 
Coulters that they had heard anoth
er broadcast in which Larry played 
an accordion. This was very puz
zling to the family because he had 
never played an accordion in his 
life. By now they have received a 
card from him saying that he was 
safe and that he had purchased an 
accordion to play in the prison 
where he had organized a band 
made up of American prisoners.
On January 10 Mr. Norman 
Dawes received a letter from an 
aunt of Larrys who had promised 
to give Mr. Dawes his address when 
it was available. In this letter she 
enclosed the mail regulations for 
letters to prisoners of the Japanese 
Government. Larry wants his 
friends to write to him; Mr. Dawes 
and Miss Lawton in the Music De
partment have his address and the 
information about writing.
Now Is the Time to Get 
Thistle Subscriptions
Have you ordered your copy of 
the Thistle? If not, youd better 
hurry. The Thistle office has just 
informed us that this years Thistle 
is going to press around February 1 
and will be available sometime in 
April, and quite a number of the 
students have not ordered their copy 
as yet. The sales are open now and 
the cost for this publication is $1.50. 
Orders will be taken in the Thistle 
office and by representatives on the 
campus. Dont delay any longer! 
Place your order today!
Everybody who is in either of the 
classes of April 44, or August 44 
must have his picture taken at Parry 
Studios, 610 Smithfield Street, be
fore January 21. No charge is made 
for the taking of the picture, but 
those who desire to may purchase 
pictures from Parrys. Also it is 
imperative that all who are in the 
classes enumerated above fill out 
and turn in activities cards, which 
are available in room 232, Industries, 
almost any afternoon, Fridays es
pecially. This is very important, 
as is the picture taking.
Todays Assembly 
Features Films
There will be an assembly today 
at 11:00 in the Little Theater, at 
which four Movie Shorts will be 
shown. The first of these is a war 
film, depicting the Battle of Tarawa, 
and the conferences held in Cairo 
and Teheran, Persia. Two of them 
are travel films, delightfully por
trayed, and followed by a nature 
movie, showing a fascinating battle 
between a rattlesnake and a West
ern Roadrunner (species of bird).
Beginning next week, the last 
Tuesday of each month will be de
voted to movies. On next Tuesday, 
January 25, one of the most power
ful war films yet developed will be 
shown. This film, entitled War De
partment Report, and consisting of 
captured German and Japanese 
films, depicts important events such 
as the abduction of Mussolini, the 
bombing of Pearl Harbor, and also 
shows for the first time on the screen 
some of the strategic German and 
Jap positions and strongholds. This 
vital film has had no public show
ing thus far; however, the few who 
have seen it in private showings to 
military personnel, recommend it as 
a film every American should see.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1944
Cdito^i A'ufuUtain.The Outlook . . .
This week we received a letter 
from a member of the ASTP which 
We feel aptly expresses a viewpoint 
deserving of notice. There have 
.been many comments on the Army 
yersus the civilians, some of them 
derogatory. This letter helps clari
fy the soldiers attitude.
Dear Editor,
The last Tartan was productive 
of many things. One of the more 
interesting items was an editorial 
seeking the reasons for the icy at
titude which exists between the 
Army and the civilian students in 
the new canteen. It asked why 
Tech girls again met with so little 
response and cooperation in their 
efforts to bring about an improve
ment of social relations between 
Army and civilians.
In order that some comprehension 
may be attained, it is necessary that 
the composition of a soldier be un
derstood. He is an ordinary per
son; is plain, down to earth, matterof-fact. The world in which he lives 
is not a world of paper castles; it is 
a world of reality. The soldier is 
not overwhelmed by that which is 
ostentatiously artificial.
Contrast that philosophy with 
that which the soldiers found here 
at Tech. Since their arrival, the 
Army men have been thrust into an 
entirely new environmentand this 
environment does not have as its 
basis the fundamental principles of 
military life. The campus, and 
those who are most conspicuous 
about the campus, display a com
portment tinged with artificiality. 
The most typical characteristics of 
Carnegie is the touch of pseudo-sophistication which is entirely alien 
to the men in uniform. This breath 
of sham is far from catholic; but that 
it manifests itself in a few students 
lulls the potential fascination of all 
Tech girls.
There are other points which 
might be mentioned: the not incon
ceivable hollowness of demands for 
cooperation and the heavily-veiled 
undertone of hauteur which is pre
sented to army men. These differ
ences are the greatest barrier to soldier-civilian harmony.
J. W. Vaughan.
The ASTP is not a program form
ed to make smooth the path to a 
commission. It is not an insurance 
policy for a high non-commissioned 
rating. It is not a guarantee of any
thing except greater responsibility 
in some capacity for which there is 
pressing need. Ideas do persist, in 
the form of wishful thinking, that 
Well, it could happen.
Suppose we stop and think. The 
Army could hardly afford to give 
something for value unproven in 
time of war and hope to accomplish 
its task with maximum possible effi
ciency and minimum breakage. 
How, then, can anyone believe that 
he, simply because he has added 
some months of specialized training 
to his military career, will be 
promptly placed in some vital posi
tion with suitable promotion and 
told to take over? Will a matter of 
a few good grades made on a class
room examination, however diffi
cult, entitle him to fill a post of vital 
importance? Wars, we repeat, are 
not won that way.
Wont the trained AST graduate 
have at least a chance of attaining 
a really worthwhile goal? Certain
lyan excellent chance. He must 
prove himself, that is all. This in 
itself is no easy task. He will find 
himself competing with thousands 
of fellow graduates as well as all 
his intelligent buddies. There is 
certainly a place for him. The pres
ent conflict is about to' reach its 
peak and is likely to remain there 
for some time. An infinity of uses 
for specialists in a multitude of 
fields will persist for an indefinite 
length of time. No ones talents will 
be forgotten.
The ASTP is out to provide a res
ervoir of technicians for purposes 
as vital as those requiring a pool of 
M-4s or Flying Fortresses. Its grad
uates are not trained to receive cas
ual promotions or appointments. 
Rather they are being made ready 
to apply what they have learned as 
it is needed, and thus prove them
selves capable of holding those cov
eted higher positions.
Does any soldier need a stronger 
incentive? *
A. V. P.
The surge of the Russian armies 
into Poland suddenly brought home 
the fact that we cannot wait until 
the actual end of hostilities to map 
out the United Nation post-war 
plans. The diplomatic war be
tween Russia and Poland, which our 
Win the war first enthusiasts 
want to forget until the last shot had 
actually been fired, has to be settled 
immediatelyand fortunately will 
be settled due to the foresight of our 
leaders. This specific problem does 
not require our personal attention, 
but it warns us that we had better 
start thinking about th kind of 
world we want so that we can voice 
our opinions authoritatively when 
the time comes.
It is obvious that before attempt
ing to straighten out this world we 
must analyze the shortcomings of 
our so-called family of nations. 
And when we do this, one thing 
strikes us at oncethe total anarchy 
among nations. Recognizing the pyramidical structure of societythe 
individual, the family, the club, 
group and organization, the city, 
the province (which in this coun
try we call state), and finally the 
state (in our case the Federal Gov
ernment), we see that each one of 
these, except the state, is under the 
jurisdiction of a higher caste. The 
days of unpunished murder by the 
individual are gone; we have long 
since realized that any society can
not exist if its members are not held 
responsible for their acts. Murder 
and theft are punished; business 
groups are controlled by anti-trust 
laws and such; even the so-called 
internal sovereignty of the gov
ernment is curbed by the Constitu
tion. We have felt the need for this 
within our nationsbut we fail to 
see that the same things hold true 
for international relations. We still 
doggedly hold on to our external 
sovereignty, and we do not realize
Twenty-ninth Meeting 
January 12, 1944
The meeting was called to order at 
5:25 p.m.
Present: Messrs. Festenstein, Marcus,
and Wolff; Misses Rial, Skillington, and 
Bloom.
COMMITTEE REPORTS 
Elections
Mr. Festenstein read a petition from 
C. W. C. A. requesting that an election 
be held on Tuesday, January 18, from 
11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., for vice-presi
dent of C. W. C. A. from among the fol
lowing candidates: Ruth Davis, Doris
Jahn, and Jeanne Norris. He moved that 
this petition be accepted.
Motion carried.
Publications
Mr. Wolff reported that the TARTAN 
had come, out a day late because the in
creased size of its staff necessitated more 
organization. Now, however, the staff is 
organized and the TARTAN will here
after come out on time.
Social
Miss Rial read a petition from the 
Freshman Class of Margaret Morrison 
asking for permission to hold a tea dance 
on Saturday afternoon, February 12. She 
moved that this petition be approved.
Motion carried.
Special Committee
Miss Skillington reported on forthcom
ing assembly programs. There will be a 
series of movie shorts on January 18 and 
a war ordinance movie on January 25. 
She also reported the need for publicity 
in order to increase assembly attendance. 
Hereafter notices will be posted on bul
letin boards throughout campus rather 
than on official bulletin boards only.
that it is as absurd and as dangerous 
as a system ^which would permit 
murder because it is nobodys bus
iness.
After the last war, a few 
ed menone of them President 
sonwere aware of this, and at
tempted to set up a league of na
tions, endowed with the power to 
punish a state for any act of aggres
sion, just as a state punishes an in
dividual for a legal transgression. 
This, the only solution for our dif
ficulties, failed thenwe cannot let 
it fail again. Already a beginning 
has been made along this line by 
the establishing of the UNRRA, but 
'this organization must be enlarged 
upon by forming an international 
council not only for relief and re
habilitation in the near future, but 
with permanent power to hold the 
nations responsible for their acts. 
Wanton aggression would be met 
with and stifled by determined action> and wars like this one would 
be impossible.
There is hardly an intelligent per
son who could discredit this system 
yet there are some who want to go 
even farther. It is not enough to 
combat fascism when it has ripen
ed to aggress other countries; we 
must stifle it at its very origin. We 
must not only enforce a set of rules 
for international conduct; we must 
also see to it that all nations embody 
a modified Bill of Rights in their 
national policy. Totalitarian coun
tries like Argentina will no longer 
be permitted to exist as fascist 
states, for even though they might 
not be in a position to attack their 
neighbors, the ideal League of 
Nations will not even tolerate the 
mistreatment of minorities within 
any country, or the abridgement of 
certain freedomsspeech, religion, 
etc.which any decent society con
siders inalienable.
Many paths will open after this 
warlet us take the right one.
E. A. L.
Notices will also appear regularly in the 
dormitories and the fraternity houses.
Mr. Festenstein and Mr. Wolff are to take 
(pare of fraternity distribution; Miss 
Bloom is to take care of dormitory no
tices.

Mr. Murphy reported that Mr. William 
Robbins had been elected chairman of 
the Intramural Board and would there
fore automatically become the represen
tative of the Board on A.CA.C.
OLD BUSINESS
Possible improvements for the Canteen 
were discussed. It was suggested that 
logs be burned in the fireplace, that 
murals be painted by members of the 
Painting and Design Department, and 
that students try to keep the Canteen 
cleaner.
NEW BUSINESS
Mr. Murphy read the constitution of 
the HOBS Club.
Mr. ^Volff moved that the constitution 
be placed on Mr. Murphys desk for one 
week, so that anyone so desiring can read 
it before it is voted upon next week.
Motion carried.
Miss Ruth Tisherman was present at 
the meeting as a representative of the 
C.W.C.A. Cabinet. As an organization A j 
representative she may be present at i 
meetings of A.C.A.C. and take part inj 
the discussions, but she has no vote. 1 I
Other organizations on campus arf I 
urged to send non-voting representative / ' 
to A.CA.C. meetings.
Adjournment.
Respectfully submitted,
 SALLY BLOOM,
I Secretary.
Letter To The Editor
To the Editor:
I should like to express the appreciation of our varsity basketball team 
for the splendid support of the ASTP boys at the Penn State game last 
Friday evening. It reminded me of the old days when the Dorm Gang 
turned out en masse and tried to boot us home. That these soldiers from 
all over the country, who have been here such a short time, backed us just 
as enthusiastically as they did their own splendid regimental team was 
very gratifying, and had a lot to do with the excellent performance of a 
bunch of youngsters who are giving 150 percent of themselves through a 
constant succession of discouraging situations.
Max E. Hannum.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Apuca *7 A. S. *7. P.
UffX Foreign Legion Trooper 
| ^ ives Tale Of Two Armies
 - J6'an Kay, tall, silent, cultur7ed, a demon with the book of life, as 
with that of knowledge, Jean, Gerv man born, French educated, and 
American nationalized is at present 
a member of the small Spanish sec
tion now in training at Tech.
There are many ways for his story 
to open. It is as well to begin here:
Jean was too young to serve in 
the regular French Army. He had 
just graduated from the Lycee Janson de Sailly, at Paris, when the war 
started. The age requirement for 
the regular French Army is 18 and 
Jean, being only 17, joined the For
eign Legion for service in Africa. In 
September of 1939 he was sent to 
Sidi-Bel-Abbes, Algeria, which is a 
sort of Reception center; then to 
an instruction company for basic 
at Saida, in southern Algeria, and 
.?then assigned to an infantry heavy 
weapons company in the Third Battallion of the Second Regiment of 
Foreign Infantry. He was the 
youngest man in his company.
The greatest part of the fighting 
was against the Arabs. Kay tells 
about one time when he nearly got 
his, in June, 1940. His Company 
was digging in around Oved-Yem in 
Morocco, in anticipation of an ex
pected German air attack. The 
planes came over before the men 
were finished, and caught Kay and 
some other fifty men in his section 
in the open. Kay said he was just 
lucky to be one they didnt get.
Its one of the worst feelings you 
can have, this being attacked by 
airplanes and having nothing you 
can do. You just lie still, do noth
ing, and hope.
When France surrendered, the 
men in the Legion were very con-i
 fused; no one knew exactly what to 
do. The men in the Legion were all 
volunteers, most of them refugees, 
real enemies of Germany. About 
'half of Kays Company were Span
iards who had fought against the 
Falangist Forces during the Civil 
War, and who had been forced to 
leave when they were finally de
feated. Kay himself was born in 
Germany: his father was Jewish, 
although he is a Catholic. In 1933, 
with the beginning of Naziism, his 
father, a radio business man in Ger
many, left Germany for France. So 
Kay and his family consider them
selves refugees in a sense. Most of 
the Legion was made up of such 
men; men who had something for 
'yhich to fight Germany. 
f But one thing that might seem 
surprising is that the majority of 
the non-commissioned officers in the 
Legion were German; typical mili
taristic Germans, who, according to 
Kay, drove their men like slaves.

My Impressions .
By Eph Abramson
And they were not very enthusiastic 
in their fight against the Fascists in 
Africa.s'With the war over, no one seemed 
to know what to do with these vol
unteers in the Legion. Finally it 
was decided to build the Trans-Saharan railroad. To be discharged 
from the Legion, one had to have 
five hundred dollars, or a letter from 
parents that a home was waiting. 
Those who met either of these re
quirements were discharged; the rest 
were put to work on the railroad. 
Kay had a letter from his parents in 
.France, so he was discharged, but 
before he left he saw the railroad 
started.
The German non-coms and the 
pro-collaboration French officers 
drove the men like slaves; they 
were beaten, and forced to go with
out medical care. This is the way 
they treated men who thought they 
had come to fight for France.
The discharge of a man is not act
ually complete until he arrives at 
home. Strictly speaking, Kay was 
still a soldier of the Foreign Legion 
all the way through France to the 
town of Agen, in unoccupied France. 
And during the trip he was required 
to salute all the officers of the Ger
man army; and there were plenty 
of them, he says, even in the un
occupied territory.
He went back to school for a year 
of post-graduate work at the local 
lycee, but it wasnt long before his 
parents began to fear fr his safety, 
because although officially the war 
was over, former French soldiers 
were not liked by the Germans, even 
though they were in unoccupied 
France. Situations occurred which 
convinced Kay and his parents that 
he was actually in danger of his life, 
so he applied to the American con
sul at Marseilles and obtained a visa 
to go to America. He came to New 
York in 1941 and lived with some 
friends. He was inducted on March 
24, 1943.
Kay took the opportunity of the 
interview to debunk the French 
Foreign Legion for all of its glam
our.
There isnt any glamour about 
the Legion, and anyone going there 
looking for it is going to be very dis
appointed. The Hollywood descrip
tions are just a lot of bunk.
Kay in addition to English also 
speaks fluently French, German, and 
Spanish.
Whos who and whats what at the 
Tau Delt Dance last Saturday 
night: . . . Amidst dark walls, soft 
.lights and swaying couples, one

THE CARNEGIE TARTNTUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1944
one of the profs
The English department of Car
negie Tech lost one of its most 
valued members during Christmas 
vacation when Mr. Donald Goodfellow temporarily absented himself 
from campus to finish his doctoral
thesis at Harvard. The versatile Mr. 
Goodfellow has been at Carnegie 
since 1928, where until recently he 
taught the Creative Writing classes 
in Fine Arts which were deeded to 
him by their founder, the famous 
American poet, Hanial Long. After 
the war disrupted his more stimu
lating classes, Mr. Goodfellow turn
ed his energies to the instruction of 
the civilian engineers, Margaret 
Morrison girls, and ASTP men in 
the more mundane classes of Fresh
man English. Before coming to 
Pittsburgh, the New York born pro
fessor majored in Latin in Colgate 
University, was principal of Morris 
High School in New York for three 
years and won his masters degree at 
Harvard. His students find him a 
most interesting and inspiring in
structor and have honored him by 
making him an honorary member of 
Pi Delta Epsilon, the journalistic 
honorary fraternity. In the words of 
one of his former Creative Writing 
students, Mr. Goodfellow is describ
ed as having a quiet manner which 
gives way to dynamic energy in the

classroom, a pleasant, easy, and ex
ceedingly friendly mien, a splendid 
voice, and a perfect mastery of his 
subject. Indeed a good fellow! The 
professor (we feel that we can safe
ly predict that title) has indeed won 
his laurels in the profession which 
,he had planned to follow since a 
child. Aside from teaching, Mr. 
Goodfellow enjoys mountain climb
ing, listening to and playing good 
music, and adding to his already ex
tensive collection of literary Ameri
cana. He executes the works of 
Beethoven, his. favorite composer, 
exceedingly well on the piano. His 
favorite authors are Dickens and 
.Thackeray from the Victorian pe
riod, and John Marquand and J. C. 
Powys in a more modern vein. Bi
ography and satire appeal to him 
more than does fiction; his only 
vice is the reading of the great 
American curse, the mystery story. 
Together with his wife, who has 
bsen with him in Pittsburgh since 
1932, Mr. Goodfellow enjoys walk
ing in the woods, and climbing all 
the mountains he can find. He likes 
his wifes apple pies and home-made 
bread, for the enjoyment of which 
he is indebted to his kid brother 
who introduced the two when Mrs. 
Goodfellow was instructing him in 
the rudiments of English in a small 
up-state New York high school. He 
does not like radio advertising, liver, 
intolerance, or oysters.
Throughout the years many col
leges have tried to lure Mr. Good
fellow away from Carnegie Tech, 
but he refuses to abandon his first 
love. He thoroughly enjoys his life 
here and wants to have a share in 
the great post-war future he en
visions for Carnegie Tech. C. I. T. 
wishes you all the luck in the world 
in your struggles with the literary 
life of John Quincy Adams, Mr. 
Goodfellow,

Unsuspecting Tartanette 
Forced To Toil For Army
Inspired by the desire for close in
tegration of civilian and military 
journalistic work, your military 
Winchells bring you the following 
effort of an entrapped Tartanette. 
Joe is, of course, a composite of each 
and every campus GI. Item: Those 
Phillip Morrises did NOT go on the 
expense account.
* *
Like the seasoned hunter stalking 
his quarry, I tracked down Joe 
ASTP and finally trapped him in a 
lonely corner of the Tech Canteen. 
There he sat, silent and sulky, until 
I promised him an ice cream cone if 
he would give his consent to be in
terviewed. He reluctantly nodded 
his assent to my proposal and soon I 
was about my fiendish taskget
ting the low-down on our transient 
population clothed in khaki.
Yielding to natural feminine cur
iosity, I asked him to give me his 
views on what the typical coed he 
sees flirting in and out of Industries, 
Margaret Morrison, and* the Art 
School, is like.
Well, on the basis of unprejudic
ed observation, I would say the Tech 
co-ed is about five feet four inches 
tall, a brunette of sorts, has a good 
figure and, generally speaking, is 
above average in beauty.
Is that* all?, I asked, quivering 
with expectation.
The ASTPerson named Joe grin
ned impishly and stretched out his 
hand for my pack of rapidly dim
inishing Philip Morris. (I wonder 
if they can be put on the expense 
account.) 
No, that isnt all, maamno in
deed, not by a long shot, he 
drawled. The Tech co-ed is con
ceited about her intelligence, snob
bish, and not to pull any punches, is 
just plain lazy.
As youve probably noticed, there 
is no lack of dateable material off 
campus. So, the Teih type of babe 
leaves me cold and causes me no 
lack of sleep.
I choked over this and puffed on 
my cigarette. Regaining control, I 
asked:
If your ego were ever reduced to 
the point where you would conde
scend to date one of us, what kind 
of girl would you look for? 
Ignoring the glacial accent of my 
voice, he replied: Shed have to be 
really good-looking and not intelli
gent enough to become obnoxious. 
Needless to say, a pleasing person
ality and a definite amount of
r
STANDARD LEATHER CO.

friendliness are prerequisites 
as dating her is concerned. M> wal
let isnt ever bursting its seams, so 
shed have to go easy when we made 
the rounds. Being a good dancer 
and liking to do the things I enjoy 
doing would just about fill the bill 
as far as Im concerned.
I pounced verbally on the unsus
pecting soldier and prepared to sink 
him with a rapid volley of questions.
Just what is your idea of an ideal 
date? I asked. I mentally prepar-s 
ed myself for anything.
He put his arms behind his head 
and stretched luxuriously.
When and if I have the money, 
he reflected, an ideal date would be 
dinner, movies, a night club and, 
if a car were available and other 
things permitted, a nice long ride in 
the country.
By this time I was drooling anc 
dropping pencils, erasers, and boo^ 
all over the Canteen.
Whats your trouble, kid? quer 1 
ied the big lug as he helped me gath-i 
er my scattered belongings. We 
bumped heads. I grabbed my things 
and, mumbling dazedly about hav
ing a deadline to make, I staggered 
up to the soda fountain and asked 
for a coke and aspirin. Now I know 
why so many newspapermen turn to 
Demon Rum early in their 
careers. After all, arent stimulants! 
prescribed in case of shock? 1
For, with just one remark, Joe had 
caused my mental image of a first-* 
class sad sack to burst into pieces.
I guess Joe ASTP is just like any 
other man except for that lantern 
and sword.* * *
Now, we ask you!
Award Is Offered For 
Best Sketch Of Salome
Salome, exotic, mysterious woma: 
of history, inspiration of operas am

of controversy and attention. Thi 
time she is the object of one of the 
broadest talent hunts yet attemptec 
by Hollywood film makers.
. In attempting to portray Lloyc 
C. Douglas best-seller, The Robe, 
Film Producer Frank Ross has be 
come perplexed at the varied rep
resentations of Salomes famed 
beauty, none of which, he feels, is 
adequate. As a result, Mr. Ross has 
appealed to the artists of America 
to produce their conceptions in cray 
on, water color, or oils. For the bes 
sketch, an award will be made and 
the sketch adjudged best will serve 
as a guide for a nation-wide search 
for the actress to impersonate Sa

Carnegie Five Nosed Out 
By Penn State in Thriller
Tech may have lost a basketball 
game to State Friday night, but, 
in doing so, she gained something 
of much greater importance: the 
support of the ASTP. For the first 
time since their arrival, the men in 
uniform came away from a Car
negie game limp  they had root
ed their heads off for Tech. They 
had cheered for one of the gamest 
fives ever to represent this school. * * *
When, at half-time, the call for 
Al boomed out with increasing 
persistence, the uninitiated GI 
turned to his neighbor and asked, 
Well, who is Al? Al, my khakiclad friends, is Mr. Al. C. Minetti. 
Al is a 25 CE graduate of Tech who 
had been a cheerleader from 23 to 
25. He has never missed a Tech 
home game for lo, these many years. 
The cheer he leads is traditional 
at all home games. Al is a grand 
fellow, and we look forward to see
ing him lead many another cheer.* * *
Understand that D-B game on 
Friday was a real thriller: D won 
in the last five seconds on a shot by 
Benko. Ward of B is still going like 
blazes  scored 16 points in that 
game.? ? H
Company B licked Company C 
last Saturday to the score of 26-12. 
Again it was the combination of 
Ward and Heisey that clicked for 
the victors. Keep your eye on Ward 
in the race for leading scorer in the 
Company Basketball League.
Five of the gamest fellows ever 
to represent Carnegie Tech on the 
basketball floor played their hearts 
out last Friday night, January 14. 
only to lose, 34-32, to a powerful 
and talented Penn State quintet. 
The Blue and White was a tremen
dous favorite over the winless Skibos, but the game was not decided 
until the last four seconds of play, 
Currans field goal breaking a 32-32 
deadlock.
Carnegies deliberate attack sur
prised Tech rooters as well as the 
State coach and team. The Plaid 
drew first blood when Johnny Shott 
dropped in a foul shot after nearly 
four minutes of play. However, Bud 
Long of State, a Marine trainee, 
threw three straight field goals 
through the cords to give the Blue 
a 6-1 lead before Kelly scored 
Techs second point. Long com
pleted his teams scoring in the first 
period with another field goal. The 
Tartans rallied momentarily at the 
start of the next ten minutes of 
play as a field goal by Shott and 
Kellys foul brought the count to
8-5. At this point Coach Max Hannum decided he didnt like Referee 
Ketchells decision on a foul and 
let him know it in no uncertain 
terms. The result was a technical 
foul and a point for State. The half 
closed after two thrilling rallies. 
The Lions scored seven straight 
points to take a commanding, 10- 
point lead, their longest of the 
game; whereupon, the Tartans, led 
by Shott, tallied nine consecutive 
points and cut the Blues edge at 
the half to one point, 15-14.
The second half was a thriller. 
Levys foul tied the score at 15-all, 
but State once more forged ahead 
at 23-16, before two quick goals by 
Kelly brought the score to 23-20 at 
the quarter. Again it was Levy who 
dropped in a foul to tie the game
at 25-25, and the excitement rose 
to fever pitch. Both teams were 
desperate but still cautious. A field 
goal put State ahead but Levy 
threw up two tallies to tie it up and 
put Tech ahead for the first time 
since the first period, 29-27. State 
tied the score before Hathaways 
goal and Shermans foul gave Car
negie what looked like the ball 
game at 32-29, with only 90 seconds 
remaining. The bubble burst when' 
Funk, the only civilian on the Penn 
State squad, tied the contest at 
32-all and Curran dropped in the 
clincher just before the whistle.
Each member of Techs starting 
lineup; Howard Levy and Joe Kelly 
at the forward posts, Johnny Shott 
in the center slot, and guards Jack 
Sherman and Al Hathaway; played 
the entire forty minutes of the 
game, and after the final whistle 
each left the floor close to tears. 
Carnegies well-laid plans to way
lay the Nittany Lions, by* beating 
them at their own zone-defense 
game, nearly met with success.

Regimental Quintet

In the prelim to the Tech-State 
tussle, the regimental team wallop
ed the Westinghouse Apprentice 
quintet: 68-48. Sparked by Steve 
Gaza, the Indiana Flash, the boys 
led all the way. Gazas 28 point to
tal led the scoring parade. Chap

ed runner-up honors with 13 and
11 points respectively. Antosich 
topped the Air-Brake outfit with 
a tidy 14 point total. Strangely 
enough, although the G. I.s won 
handily enough, with a 17-point 
margin, they dropped in only one 
more field goal.
The first quarter provided one of 
the wildest scoring sprees ever 
seen in the Tech gymnasium. When 
the whistle blew and the smoke 
cleared, the A. S. T. boys were 
ahead 23-16.
The second period slowed 'down 
to a trot after the fire engine first 
quarter. The visitors contented 
themselves with working the ball 
outside our zone, and turned in a 
neat exhibition of long shooting. 
The half-time count showed Lt. 
Pickrels eager heavers on the long 
end of a 31-24 score.
The East Pittsburgh lads came 
back with a vengeance, and mid
way in the third stanza closed the 
gap to 37-34. Again the home team 
checked, and, with OBrien and Les 
Brown working hard, moved up to 
the 44 mark, six points ahead at 
the three-quarter mark.
The fourth quarter was all Gaza. 
The tall Hoosier went on a ram
page, and ran his individual total 
up to 28 markers.

Dance to All-Soldier Orchestra 
At Fine Arts Exhibition Hall
Jan. 22 To Usher In 
Post Holiday Event
On with the dance. Come on 
gate lets swing  regardless of 
whether youre a sophisticated 
swayer or a whirling top, brothers 
and sisters, slip on your gayest duds 
and buzz over (ohthe sophisti
cates dawdle over) to the first social 
event of the second semester. To 
get down to technicalities, the dance 
will be held Saturday, January 22nd 
in the Fine Arts Exhibition Hall.
Music for this get together will be 
swung out and also smoothed over 
by our own group of Tech boys, the 
proverbial magic muses (i. e. they 
play anything under the moon from 
sweet to bitter.)
For you gourmets who indulge in 
delicate morsels and tonsorial drool
ing there will be refreshments.
The social committee has racked 
its brains and worked its fingers to 
the marrow to insure everyone that 
the wallflower situation will be nil.
Never a dull moment will exist. By 
the end of the evening, the commit
tee feels sure that a suitable caption 
for the affair will be Auld Lang 
Syne.
Fifty cents per person will take 
care of the monetary end of it. Fel
lows in uniform will be admitted 
gratis.
Due to a typographical error the 
event was listed in the supplement 
as being held at the Carnegie Union, 
well, dont believe what youve read 
cause its going to be held in the 
Fine Arts Exhibition Hall.
How about some cooperation? We 
all like new faces so why not come 
and add some new maps to your col
lection? Well be seeing you.
Publicity Committee 
To Meet January 26
Any student interested in becom
ing a member of the Evening School 
Publicity Committee is requested 
to report to the Pattern Shop, sec
ond floor, Industries on Wednesday 
evening, January 26. Membership 
is open to any evening student. By 
serving on the committee Insignia 
award points can be earned. Meet
ing will commence at 8:15.
Student One-Acts
A new and novel experiment will 
be conducted when C. I. T. students 
present Student One-Acts. These 
plays are written, produced and en
acted solely by Carnegie Tech Dra
ma students. The plays are to be 
presented Monday, Tuesday and 
Wednesday evenings, January 17th 
to 19th inclusive. Tickets may be 
obtained by evening school students 
from Mr. Del McKelway in room 
255-C on the second floor of the Ad
ministration Building upon pre
sentation of registration card.
Im sure this is going to be a 
super-duper column, as I certainly 
cant concentrate amidst all the 
clicking of typewriters, yelling 
.across the room, and the All Time 
Hit Parade being blasted forth 
from our snazzy radio in the office. 
However, I understand that these 
trifling noises dont begin to com
pare with what our service boys 
have to go through when they write 
home from their barracks. So far 
be it from me to complain! Hear 
that Bob Bassett, a former Plaid 
worker, now serving with the armed 
forces, is with the Thirty-Third 
Special Service Company and helps 
keep up the morale of our boys. 
Keep up the good work, Bob, be
cause were all in there rooting for 
you . . . Wonder why Dottie Papa 
dropped in at the Plaid office late 
last Friday night? Thought shed 
never show up! Her ice skates 
carelessly slung over her shoulder 
were proof enough of where she 
was, but what we want to know is: 
Who was she with? She claims 
she (ahem!) bumped into ? ? ? ? 
.quite a few Techites down there on 
the ice. Hm!! This is worth inves
tigating ... in case you boys were 
looking around last Wednesday, you 
Should have seen those gorgeous 
figures decorating the pool. They 
Were none other than Arlene MacMurray and Gladys Bayer by 
name. Tsk! Tsk! Boys! You can do 
better than that . . . Oh yes! How 
about that recent surprise black
out? Seems as if somebody else was 
caught by surprise too!
Sunday afternoon would have 
been one good time for you gals to 
select the model husband-to-be, for 
at 1:30 in the afternoon, the he-men 
.of our Student Council pooled their 
muscular strength to rearrange 
furniture, straighten the cupboards, 
and scrub up the Plaid office. What 
a job of Interior Decorating! (Hey! 
Whered they put my desk?) . . . 
Now dont forget, all you guys and 
gals, reserve the 22nd for the Dance 
at the Fine Arts Hall. Do come! 
Wont you? I guarantee youll not 
regret it.
George Riffle Named 
Fine Arts President
Have you ever met George Riffle? 
Well, consider this a personal intro
duction to him. Youre liable to see

Shop, cooking up entertainment
for the dances and parties, as George

Social Committee.
He also holds another important 
position on the Campus this year 
President of Fine Arts. A fine rec

Georges main hobby is photogra
phy and he also serves the Plaid 
staff by being the staff photogra
pher. He is, at the present time, do
ing a lot of extensive experimental 
and research work in colored pho
tography. (I think its just a hoax 
Jo get pretty girls to pose for him, 
though).
George hails trom Braddock 
where for four years he conducted 
an electrical business of his own. 
At the present time he is employed 
by the Pittsburgh Meter Company 
in the Meter Department.
Come Work On the Plaid

know you can hardly wait for the 
Plaid news each week so heres your 
chance to be in on the preview 
and add your own bit of talent.
Speaking of talent, the Publicity 
committee has long been on the 
look-out for you artists, sign paint
ers, printers and journalists, so why 
not stop hoarding those brilliant 
ideas, bring a few to the commit
tee and help advertise the evening 
student social activities. Gather all 
the news, gossip, etc., you can find 
and come up to the Pattern Shop
