Buk Xchanj 
In Operation
APO Project Provides 
Handy Book Outlet
Buk Xchanj, a student book ex
change sponsored by Alpha Phi 
Omega, re-opened Friday, Febru
ary 1, and will be open until Feb
ruary 16. Books will be accepted 
for sale only until February 14.
Buk Xchanj operates at the be
ginning of each semester out of 
the soap closet under the stairs in 
Administration Hall across from 
the dean of students office. The 
business hours this semester are 
from 11:30 to 1:20 weekdays and 
from 11:30 to 12:30 Saturdays.
APO accepts the books from the 
students and attempts to sell them 
at the prices named by the stu
dents. Five cents is asked for ev
ery book sold in order to pay op
erating expenses. If any profit is 
made, it is channelled to other 
projects designed to benefit all the 
students. All cash from sales and 
unsold books must be picked up 
by the owner by February 16 or it 
becomes the property of APO. 
Profit made from possible resale 
of unclaimed books will also be 
indirectly returned to the stu
dents through other service proj
ects.
The success of this project de
pends entirely upon the student 
body, for APO can sell no books 
unless the students bring them in. 
It costs nothing to try to sell 
books, and some other student will 
benefit because of the opportunity 
to save money.

dents interested in the general 
scholarship competition for

Letter to the Students
Why A Student Council?
Underlying the existence of Student Council at Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology is the basic premise that the first purpose of the 
university is its studentsa proposition asserting that colleges and 
universities exist not for administrations, and boards of trustees, nor 
for members of faculties, but for students. As this proposition is 
fundamentally true, it is the legitimate interest of each student to 
be concerned with the manner in which the educational process 
affects him. The factors which are directly shaping his lifecur
riculum and extra-curricular activities, teaching staff, educational 
facilitiesare all of importance.
Must Consider Student Wants
Of more importance, although often not fully recognized, is the 
fact that the student is in a position to make his opinion an influ
ence concerning educational matters. This does not mean, nor is 
construed to mean, that the student body of a school can dictate its 
policies and administration. It does mean that in matters of vital 
interest to students, their opinions must occupy a considerable weight 
in the final determination of the policies and administration of the 
university. No educational institution can neglect the evaluation of 
student wants; dissatisfied alumni do not aid its future either by 
financial contribution or influencing enrollment.
Essentially these principles are recognized at Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, and as the most effective democratic method of evalu
ating student opinion on matters of student interest there is a Student 
Council. It is the proper function of a Student Council to work for 
the majority interest of the student body in all educational matters 
which concern them.
Student Viewpoint Never Disregarded
At its best, Student Council at Carnegie has fulfilled this func
tion. It has presented student opinion and worked for student wel
fare in problems ranging from football de-emphasis to smaller class 
sizes and Saturday classes. On these problems results have been 
good, for though the student viewpoint in these matters has not always 
been entirely accepted, it has never been disregarded by the uni
versity.
In the future, the student body, and through its Student Coun
cil, has a continuing role to play in relation to the university as new 
questions of student welfare continue to be recognized. At present, 
problems concerning dormitory facilities for men and more effective 
coordination of activities especially merit discussion and solution. 
It must be emphasized, however, that solution of these problems 
does not arise automatically from Student Council, but demands 
something from each student whom Council represents.
Welfare Up to the Students
As in any democratic system, the attainment of student welfare, 
the satisfaction of student wants and wishes, depends in finality upon 
the individual student. Each student citizen of the university must 
learn first to recognize his privileges and powers as a citizen, and 
secondly to accept the responsibility of exercising these privileges 
as intelligently as possible. As a means to the end of student wel
fare, Student Council is effective when students think and act. When 
students refuse to think and act, no means can be effective in reach
ing their goals. Student welfare is up to the students.
Justin Davidson 
President, Student Council.
Two Frosh Scratched 
As E & S Candidates
Two second-semester freshmen, Walter Steinbrenner and Rich
ard Christensen, filed petitions for the coming Student Council only 
to be declared ineligible by the Executive Committee of Council. Both 
Steinbrenner and Chritsensen had thought that their candidacy was 
legal according to Article II, Sec-*
tion 11(a) of the SC constitution, 
which states, In all colleges the 
representatives . . . shall be at 
least second-semester freshmen at 
the tune of election.
When Dean Dickinson, faculty 
representative on the Executive 
Committee, was asked for an ex
planation of the decision, he re
plied that, inasmuch as the elecon was actually a retake of the 
eccmber election, it was decided 
mat the same rules applied to the 
validated election should hold
for this election. This, of course, 
would make freshmen ineligible.
It was argued by Christensen 
that the election, regardless of its 
being a retake of the ill-fated De
cember election, was being held in 
February, not in December, and 
that the constitution explicitly give 
second-semester freshmen the 
right to run for Council.
The decision stands, however, 
by a 3-0 vote of the five-man Ex
ecutive Board, and the freshmen 
will have to wait until the May 
election.
24 Candidates Fight For 14

sentatives. Voting, supervised by APO, will be held in Skibo, Ad

ENGINEERING & SCIENCE
A1 Cahen, E&SI have been 
asked why I am running for Stu
dent Council and what I intend to 
accomplish if I am elected. Heres 
my answer:
During my two years at Tech I 
have learned to realize the im
portant role Student Council plays 
in student affairs. It is in effect 
the guiding light behind them. I 
would like to become a member of 
Council to help improve and in
tegrate the relationship between 
Council and student activities.
If I am elected, I will work 
toward the goal of improved 
school spirit in the following ways. 
First I will try to inaugurate a 
two party political system at Tech, 
much as they have in other 
schools, in order to arouse a more 
competitive spirit and produce 
more participation in elections and 
pep rallies. Secondly I will try to 
improve the freshman attitude 
towards tradition exams through 
a more comprehensive examina
tion which would necessitate some 
research work on the part of the 
student. This would help to stimu
late more interest, thereby lessen
ing the need to enforce restric
tions.
Finally, I will always try to 
keep the interests of BOTH the 
student and the Council in mind.
George Farneth., E&SI am 
running for Student Council be
cause I am really interested in 
making Council the type of organ
ization most students would like 
to have on campus. I am not inter
ested in being a representative for 
personal satisfaction, to gain 
points for an activities key, or just 
to be in another organization.
If I am elected to Council, I 
shall strive for -a revision of the 
Student Council representation in 
order to include the presidents of 
important campus organizations 
not now represented. I would like 
to see a continual investigation of 
the school budget as it pertains 
to the athletic fund, the building 
of new mens dormitories, and the 
cafeteria, to mention a few. I shall 
propose an activities assessment to 
be collected during registration 
which will be used to defer the 
cost of All-School dances (Home
coming and Spring Carnival). I 
shall strive for afternoon pep ral
lies supported by the football team 
in an attempt to increase school 
spirit. If I am elected I shall at
tend every meeting of Student 
Council (unless health forbids) 
and I will back every measure 
which is for the good of the stu
dents, will increase school spirit, 
or will improve the existing stu
dent governing body.
Pi Delta Epsilon 
Dinner, Forum Set 
For This Thursday
Pi Delta Epsilon, journalistic 
honorary, will sponsor a dinner 
and publications forum on Thurs
day, February 7, at 6 p.m. in the 
Carnegie Union.
The purpose of this forum will 
be to bring into sharp perspective 
the problems faced by publica
tions, to point a way to higher 
quality journalistic work on our 
campus, and to instill an aware
ness of their duties and functions 
in the publications people.
A complete, integrated report of 
the results of this forum will be 
compiled and sent to the people 
who work on publications.
Dick Durstine, E&SStudent 
Councils bungling in the recent 
election of Council members, 
along with the current general 
movement for improved student 
government, has brought added 
interest in the Council question.
It is SCs typical inefficiency 
that prompted me to run for E&S 
representative in the first elections 
which were invalidated. And it 
is likewise a desire to help 
straighten out the mess Council 
is in that makes me want to stay 
in the race until SC manages to 
hold an election that is legal.
If I find I can do better than 
the present representatives, I 
shall do so. If I find I cant, I 
shall cease to complain.
There are five main improve
ments I wish to work on if elect
ed:
A streamlined Council, bet
ter managed.
Improved SC publicity, 
leading to a better in
formed and more interested 
student body.
Means to make Councilmen themselves better ac
quainted with their jobs. 
Improved freshman reg
ulations and traditions pro
cedure and enforcement.
5. More original work by 
Council, such as the cur
rent Skibo investigation. 
For the near future: an 
inquiry into the mens 
dorm situation.
These are the principal changes 
in which I am interested. Each 
is important. Each is feasible. All 
will be beneficial.

Jim Lechner, E&SI am run
ning for Student Council:
Because Carnegie Tech needs 
a good Council; and because I am 
willing to work, to the best of my 
ability, to better Student Council. 
What do I intend to do? I shall 
attempt to secure the cooperation 
of Council to put the Student in 
Council,, and Council in Carnegie 
Tech.
The student wont support 
Student Council; the faculty wont 
listen to it. Why? Would you trust 
a man to fly a Constellation if he 
couldnt fly a Cub? Or accept ad
vice on driving a trailer truck 
from someone who just smacked 
up an auto? The key is efficiency. 
Council will get more authority 
and rightly sountil it can and 
does use the authority it has. It 
takes time to do a good job; the 
jobs are routine; but they must be 
done, and done right. If Councilmen are* interested enough to 
spend some time on the routine 
jobs, and do them efficiently, I feel 
that more student respect, more 
authority in school management, 
more cooperation from students 
and faculty will come their way. 
Therefore I propose: Efficiency, 
leading to a better organization, 
but to cope with the problems as 
brought out by the students it rep
resents.
Ray Sebulsky, E&SIn the re
cent past I have been one of Stu
dent Councils most severe critics. 
I am principally disgusted with 
the two attitudes that Council 
seemed always to adopt when 
faced with a problem or a project. 
The first of these is the me too 
attitude when the administration 
wants a pet policy adopted. The 
second is the let it ride feeling 
and buck passing when there is 
work to be done. I realize that 
Student Council has great, even if 
untapped, potentialities to benefit 
the student body. It can act ef
fectively to represent student 
opinion instead of that of the 
deans. It needs, however, inter
ested councilmen. And I am in
terested enough in the job to want 
a chance to do it. This is the rea
son that I am a candidate.
If I am elected I shall try to 
see that Council does what the

students want it to do. I intend to 
find out what happened to the 
suggestion boxes that were avail
able to the students last year. I 
shall exert pressure for needed 
improvements. I think improve
ments are in order for the mens 
dormitories and in Skibo, where 
better food at reasonable prices 
seems more imperative than un
necessary new chairs and tables. 
I feel that the student publications 
should possess more freedom. I 
think that latent school spirit

interest in Techs varsity teams.

size similar to Carnegie.

imaginative members, it will con

duties of social functions and 
budget authorization, while neces
sary, require too litte of the mem
bers interest or time. Council ac
tion aimed at stronger activities, 
renewed school spirit, active stu
dent elections, and a stricter 
freshman program would best 
serve the student body.
More specifically, under activ
ities, Council should meet with the 
head of each activity to discuss 
possible improvements, budget 
and staff problems. To advance 
school spirit Council could plan 
the organization of a Tech cheer
ing club for games and rallies to 
work with cheerleaders as an or
ganizer group.

Bill Stewart, E&SWhy run

even implied aims it will have to 
revise its relationship with other 
campus organizations and activi

and read the broken regulation. v

house in order. Quite simplyI 
would like to get the opportunity 
to help make the changes.
The Council seems to be con
tinually putting organizations on 
the griddle, condemning them for 
inactivity or failure. But only re
cently they withdrew support 
from Cameron Choir, WRCT, and 
Scotch n Soda which are among 
the most active organizations. Lets 
stop this double-talking sort of 
negativism. I would have Council 
act positively by keeping tabs on 
activities and pointing out to the 
sponsors probable sources of fail
ure in their plans. This is as far 
as Council jurisdiction should go. 
The organizations should not have 
their constitutions written by 
Council or under the direction of 
Council as has occurred in the 
past.
Student Council is not how a 
representative body. It needs 
enough members to get adequate 
sampling of student opinion; de
creasing the representation as pro
posed will not accomplish this. 
Council members should go to the 
students for their views, not 
weakly ask for more students to 
attend Council meetings. When
ever the periodic request for dis
solution of Council is made it 
should attempt to find the reason 
for it; then act to correct the dis
satisfaction. Council members 
should keep their eyes open. Many 
times I have heard demands for 
new cheers; the representatives 
should act on this sort of thing.
Finally, if Council is to co-or
dinate activities it must eliminate 
the bungling which has accomH&SS
Don Hand, H&SSThe Tartan 
suggested I answer two questions, 
namely; why I am running for 
Student Council and what I intend 
to try to accomplish if elected. The 
first question can be answered 
very simply. I am running because 
I feel that I can be a better rep
resentative of the students than 
any of the other candidates from 
the College of Humanistics and 
Social Studies.
As to what I intend to try to 
accomplish, if elected, I must re
peat myself somewhat. I intend 
first and foremost to represent the 
students who have elected me. 
Secondly, I plan to join with those 
members of Student Council who 
want to make Council a truly rep
resentative group and to work in 
the best interest of the students 
rather than as a puppet of the 
Administration.
Ellroy Wildhaber, H&SSI am
writing this letter in answer to 
your request in the most recent 
Tartan. I am a candidate for 
Council because I believe that 
Council lacks leadership and is 
unwilling to do anything, and I 
think I have the leadership qual
ities to make a good Council mem
ber and am willing to work in or
der to get something progressive 
and constructive done.
If I am elected to Council, I 
intend to work for the general 
betterment of the school and stu
dent body. More specifically, I can 
think of two things off hand which 
I will tackle wholeheartedly be
cause now there is nothing being 
done about them. The first is 
Council elections, which were a 
total flop last time in every sense 
of the word, publicity, filing, and 
especially student interest. ODK 
has had to undertake the job of 
publicizing them this time, and 
this is certainly not ODKs job.
The second thing which I am 
interested in is class organizations. 
Right now they are useless, but I 
am thinking over a plan which, if 
put into effect, I believe would 
provide benefits for the school 
and help further student interest.

FINE ARTS
Sorlee Gefsky, FAThe Stu
dent Council of Carnegie Tech has 
become less of a governing body 
and more of a disorganized stu
dent government. No Student 
Council can hope to operate with
out problems to solve and stand
ards to maintain, but the lack of 
co-ordination, regulation and sys
tematization of Carnegie Techs 
student government has been all 
too apparent. The main problem, I 
feel, is the lack of influence over 
the student body by the Student 
Council. In many other colleges 
the student government oversees 
practically all activities conducted 
on its campuses. I realize that 
other independent organizations 
wish to function alone, but there 
are many other activities which 
can be conducted by Student 
Council.
This is one of the main rea
sons that I have chosen to run for 
Student Council. I cannot promise 
miracles, but I can promise to do 
a worthwhile job in representing 
the students. I want a more pow
erful organization, more contrib
uting members, and a greater in
fluence over the student body. If 
our student government can be
come a more governing body that 
will actually govern, Carnegie 
Tech can expect bigger and better 
things from Student Council.
Editor, the Tartan:
According to the Student Coun
cil constitution and the manner 
in which the Executive Board of 
that organization is currently in
terpreting the rules, no student 
can be elected to Council until 
May of his freshman year. In oth
er words, freshmen are virtually 
denied any representation in cam
pus government.
I have discussed this matter in
formally with several of the lead
ers in Tech student government, 
including members of the Execu
tive Board and several mem
bers of SC. Opposition toward 
freshmen being given the oppor
tunity to serve and be represent
ed on Council seems to be based 
on the premise that all freshmen 
are incapable of competently dis
charging the duties of a SC* rep
resentative and on the fact that 
some other colleges also deny 
freshmen the rights of participa
tion in campus government.
To me this attitude smacks of 
logic that is amazing on the cam
pus of the famed Carnegie Plan. 
It is my opinion, shared by a num
ber of other students, that firstyear students, by any cannons of 
justice and reasonableness, de 
serve the opportunity to be a part 
of student government by serving 
on Council.
In the first place, it is the height 
of injustice and unreasonableness 
to tacitly assume that all freshmen 
are incapable of assuming the responsibilites of a Council repre
sentative. The first SC election is 
normally held in December; by 
that time it is entirely possible 
and quite probable that there are 
a number of first-year students 
who might at least have the abil
ity to properly conduct an elec
tion.
This issue also involves the ex
penditure of Council funds. A sub
stantial portion of the money 
which is spent each year by SC 
(about $11,000) is provided by 
freshmen; they deserve the op
portunity to help decide how their 
money should be spent.
Amending the constitution to al
low freshmen to run for Council 
will not be an easy change to effect. The powerful Executive 
Board, which approved the fla
grantly illegal procedure of an 
E&S student running on the Fine 
Arts ballot last December and 
which has now stretched the 
meaning of the constitution 'to 
throw out two freshman petitions, 
is dead-set against it. However, I 
am appealing to Council and to the 
students themselves to consider 
the merits of my suggestion. There 
are freshmen who can make a 
contribution to campus govern
ment; they ask only the oppor
tunity to do so.
Richard Christensen
Editor, the Tartan:
Since you are editor of the Tar
tan, you evidently are interesting 
in joining school activities, qpd 
are probably in general what we 
term Rah Rah Boy. However, 
some of us ignorant freshmen 
came to school purely for what 
the school has to offer scholastic
ally. Anything we care to do 
which is extracurricular we do of 
our own willsfor so is the na
ture of extracurricular activity. 
If it becomes necessary for us to 
know where the flag pole, Cut, 
or Skibo is, we will in the course 
of time learn where these places 
are on our own accord. Until we 
learn where these places are (Us
ually about the second week of 
school) the upperclassmen should 
take advantage of the situation 
laugh while the laughings good! 
It might be sometimes helpful to 
give them a hand between 
chuckles.
Please excuse the poor condi
tion of this letter; it was written 
between exams. I had to write it 
nowfor, though I am not affect
ed by the suspension of constitu
tions of organizations, I feel quite 
strongly with those freshmen who 
seem to enjoy such activities, 
probably know more about the 
school than the rest of us, and 
must be deprived of their pleas
ures.
Most sincerely,
Herbert Buchwald.

John Schonder, FAAs a can
didate for a position on Student 
Council, I find several good rea
sons for desiring membership in 
this organization. I am now, as I 
always have been, interested in 
the students and their activities.
Council is the voice and represen
tation of the students, and it exists 
only in the interest of the stu
dents. However, as most of us 
know, we have been represented 
but as yet we havent heard the 
voice. I am principally disguested 
with the do nothing attitude of 
Council, due to the lack of interest 
on the part of the students and the 
severe control of the administra
tion. Student Council is in des
perate need of aggressive and in
terested members. I am interested 
in overcoming these deficiencies, 
and place myself before you in

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1952TAMAN3
It was with a certain satisfaction that several of the 
boys from the back room were observed leaving Skibo 
Gym with long faces after the Pitt-Carnegie tilt of January 
23. Before the main event of the evening, the boys had been 
a little more cheerful: dressed in ultra style suits and 
button-at-the-top sports shirts with good 50c seegars to set 
off their ensembles, they looked all the world like prosper
ous businessmen who were about to cash in on a good in
vestment.
Inside dope has it that it was a bullish market for Pitt stock 
before the game with trading brisk and the price up 9 to 15 
points. On the basis of past performance, Pitt stock looked like 
a gilt-edged risk, and who could foretell the poor showing of the 
Panther Company that evening? From their glum countenances 
we surmise the speculative businessmen must have missed call
ing the way the ball bounces and put their button-up sports 
shirts in jeopardy.
On the more serious side, this column is in no position 
to judge whether gambling is ethical or not. As long as 
human nature remains the same, we expect it will continue 
to exist, Senator Kefauver or no. However, we do think the 
athletic department has taken the right stand in recently 
posting the No Gambling sign in the gym. Gambling on the 
scene of the sport gives people the idea that they can take 
the gamble out of gambling by the proper procedures. This 
we are quite definitely against, and the No Gambling sign 
in the gym should serve to remind the sharpies that Big 
Brother is watching them.

Plaid Upsets Panthers 
To Snap Loss Streak
Tartan Basketeers Are Becoming
Known As Hot And Cold Tearn
Carnegies Plaid basketeers snapped a five game losing streak 
and broke even in four games since the last issue of the Tartan 
to bring their season record to 6-8. The Tartans scored victories 
over Pitt and Mt. Union while losing to Case and W & J.
The Pitt victory was the Tar-*

Buddy Overend 
Feted Sunday
Clarence Buddy O v e r e n d , 
Carnegies athletic director, re 
ceived the Harvey Boyle Memorial 
Trophy on Sunday night but had 
to sit through some shenanigans to 
get it. Buddy was guest of honor at 
the annual Pittsburgh Sportswrit 
ers Show held at the William 
Penn Hotel.
The yearly event staged by the 
towns sportshawks is noted for the 
"original comedy, written and 
produced by the writers them
selves, which takes sly pokes at 
Pittsburghs athletic personages.
The sportswriters show is sim
ilar to that put on by the Grid
iron Club which does the same 
thing on a national scale.
Overend, who is retiring as Tar
tan athletic director because of the 
age requrement at the end of this 
year, was honored for his 47 years 
association with Carnegie sports. 
Captain of the Skibos first athletic 
team, hockey in 1905, Buddy re
turned to his alma mater in 1923 
as graduate manager of athletics 
and was named director of inter
collegiate athletics in 1937.
During his years with the Tar
tans, Buddy has served with dis
tinction and built friendly athletic 
relationships with universities and 
colleges all over the country for 
Carnegie. That is as much of an 
honor for Buddy as anything else.

tans biggest upset of the season 
as they stunned the Panthers with 
a 65-56 defeat. Coach Mel Cratsley 
had the Skibos drilled to perfec
tion as their tactics kept Doc 
Carlsons team off balance all eve
ning. Carnegie split Pitts zone de
fense wide open as Tom Craig 
contributed 30 points to the Tar
tan cause, mostly on lay-ups in
side the Pitt defense.
Odds Held Up
Rated nine to fifteen points un
der the Panthers, the Tartans 
didnt lead during the first half of 
the game and it looked for a while 
as if the odds would hold up. Be
hind 30-29 at the intermission, the 
Skibos came out a different team 
for the second half. An eight point 
splurge put Carnegie ahead where 
they stayed for the remainder of 
the evening.
The victory was a morale lifter 
for the Skibos as it marked the 
end of a five game losing streak. It 
was also a feather in coach Mel 
Cratsleys cap as it was the fourth 
time in five tries that he has out
smarted Doc Carlson from Sky
scraper U.
Invade Ohio
Making an invasion of Ohio, the 
Tartans fell victim to Case on 
January 30 as they were admin
istered a 64-47 defeat. The Plaid 
jumped off to a 15-11 first quarter 
lead against the Rough Riders only 
to collapse in the second quarter 
and trail the rest of the way.
Tom Craig was again the chief 
point-maker for Carnegie as he
tossed in a total of 21 on eight 
fielders and five free throws.
The second Ohio team proved 
easier for the Tartans as they 
romped over Mt. Union in an easy
72-50 win. Taking the lead in the 
opening minutes the Tartans were 
never headed as the entire team 
got into the scoring act against 
their foes. The scoring was evenly 
divided as Hilary Holste headed 
the Skibos with 15 while Tom 
Craig and Tom Beck accumulat
ed 12 apiece.
W&J Wins 
Playing their third game on the 
road, the Plaid ran afoul of W&J 
Saturday night as the Presidents 
defeated them 64-53. Carnegie 
jumped off to a 2-0 yead on Tom 
Becks fielder but by the end of 
the first quarter the Prexies had 
gone ahead at 12-11. W&J con
tinued to increase its lead in the 
second quarter and led 32-25 at 
the half.
Playing the Presidents even in 
the third quarter, the Tartans cut 
their lead at one time to 32-31. 
Then the J-boys moved away 
again to insure their win.
Long Win Streak 
The victory was the 24th 
straight on the home floor for the 
Presidents and kept intact a win 
streak over Carnegie which 
stretches back to 1937.
Tom Craig again held scoring 
honors for the Skibos with 20 
points as he led both teams. It 
kept his average at better than 20 
points for the last four games, in 
which he has scored a total of 83.
Tech Swimmers Swamp Titans; 
Weddell Cops Medley Record
Three pool records were shattered January 16 as the Tartan 
mermen swamped Westminster 52-31 for their third win of the season. 
Oddly enough two of the records were set by Westminster as Dave 
Radcliff of the Titans turned in outstanding performances in both 
the 220 and 440 yard freestyle#----------------------------------------------------------
events.
Radcliff erased the records set 
two years ago by Bruce Kinsey of 
Oberlin as he turned the distances 
in 2:17.8 for the 220 and 5:04.4 for 
the 440. The other record of the 
day was set by Carnegies Bob 
Weddell who lowered his own 
mark in the individual medley to 
1:49.8. Weddell is the only Tar
tan swimmer who is currently 
holding a Skibo pool record.

In the 100 yard freestyle Nick

line first for his second win of the 
day, and Tom Astle was a close 
runner-up as the Skibos swept the 
event. The Tartans continued their 
winning ways in both the back
stroke and breaststroke as Bob

ished one, two in the former and 
Bill Aiken and Bob McQuaid first 
and second in the latter.
Slight Comeback

the meet already won, West

it swept the last two events, the

sent the students and see that 
Council does what the students 
want it to do. I intend to find out 
why Council is not the powerful, 
expanded organization that it 
should be. I am in favor of Coun
cil taking immediate action on the 
rapidly decreasing school spirit, 
more sponsorship of all school 
spirit, more sponsorship of all 
school functions, better planned 
activities and more freedom for 
the student. Definite action should 
be taken for the improvement of 
the conditions existing in the 
dorms and Skibo. For these ob
jectives, and others, I believe 
should be the function of Student 
Council.

would be to strengthen the power 
of our student government in any 
means possible, and then, by the 
institution of several new pro
grams, satisfy Techs need for a 
more AWARE student body. From 
the awareness built up by these 
programs, the complete student 
body would be unified into an ac
tive force which in plain words is 
all that school spirit means. 
These are the reforms I would 
push:
1. Unification of the college pop
ulation.
2. A system of all-school assem
blies, that are student-moti
vated to suit student needs, an 
example which is working is 
that undertaken by Film Arts 
Society. Council could under
take a similar speakers ser
iesif it had the power to 
augment the impoverished 
speakers fund, or lack of it.
3. A planned emphasis for the 
school, in the form of an all
college projectmaybe a Stu
dents With A Purpose 
(SWAP) campaign, to fund
raise for that new stadium, or 
library, or theater  under 
Council sponsorship.
4. A student voice, or in other 
words, a vocal student gov
ernment, whose representa
tives will consult in some 
form with those who elect 
them.
These are some of the plans 
and policies I think could help 
Tech to gain spirit.

ly, with so many people working 
at Student Council, it seems to me 
that it should be able to do more 
than just draw criticisms, and it 
should have some constructive ef
fect on somebody. Probably the 
lack of interest and absence of 
members puts the whole organiza
tion behind the eight ball. Other 
schools dont have this kind of 
trouble with student government 
whats the matter with us? Im 
pretty sure well have it half lick
ed when we elect some represen
tatives who will attend regularly. 
What do you think? There are a 
number of meetings on campus 
that no one would think of miss
ing and I think the Student Coun
cil should be one of them.
