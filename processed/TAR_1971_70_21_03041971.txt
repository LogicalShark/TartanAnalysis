Director of Housing 
Explains $50 Penalty
Recently, residents of double rooms who had managed to lose their 
roommates for the course of the year (almost all through n.o fault of their 
own) were assessed an additional $50 per semester by the housing office.
Students were generally outraged and pissed off. TARTAN reporter 
Sue Zimmerman went to the Housing Office for an explanation of its ac
tion. Her report follows:
by SUE ZIMMERMAN
We looked at the $50 charge as an option, explained new Direc
tor of Housing David W. Guinivan. The response concerned the recent 
mandate from housing, obligating persons living alone in double rooms 
to find a roommate or pay a $50 fine. The majority of students took 
that option, he added.
Guinivan, who has occupied his post for only two weeks, further 
explained that the action was signed into effect one day prior to his tak
ing office. He emphasized that the action was not instigated by a sole 
person, in this case, former Director of Housing Dillon, but by the Aux
iliary Services Committee as a whole. About 15 of the 50 residents af
fected have appealed to Guinivan against the move. He agreed that the 
main responsibility of relocating residents should have lain with the 
Housing Office, but cited that a rental increase is probable next sem
ester despite this efficiency move. 1 am continuing to enforce the 
measure, Guinivan asserted. He pointed out that it is the reserved 
right of the university to reassign students, as stated in the housing 
contract, but said NOTHING ABOUT THEIR RIGHT TO CHARGE 
THE STUDENT IN SUCH AN INSTANCE.
Guinivan, self-employed for the past five years, was a former 
Housing director at the University of Pittsburgh. His main concern at 
C-MU, is to get as much exposure to students desires as possible, not 
just in regard to rules and regulations, but also to thier environment. 
To this end he has contacted the MDC and AWS on the feasibility of set
ting up a resident advisory board to meet informally once a week. Id 
like to see the student in the position of initiating housing programs, 
not just reacting to them.
In off-campus housing, said Guinivan, it is the Housing Offices re
sponsibility to better educate students to the pitfalls involved. While 
at Pitt, he investigated off-campus housing and found a large number 
of accommodations which do not meet the city health requirements.
Guinivan also seeks to investigate the faults of university housing 
which prompt students to move off campus. As far as present housing 
procedures are concerned, my time these past two weeks has been 
spent reviewing them and seeing what changes can be effected.
Guinivan would like to see more co-ed housing at C-MU. When ask
ed about the rumored plan to locate male residents next year in Morewood Gardens A tower and occupy Hamerschlag A wing with 
women, he claimed to know of no definite action. He suggested that 
this idea was initiated by MDC and AWS who have recently surveyed 
the campus on the subject.

Only the Programming Fund, 
a fund for unexpected student or

AN ENTIRELY student-subsidized Activities Budget totaling over 
$50,000 was submitted to Student Senate last Thursday for final 
approval. Although any recognized student organization can apply 
for Student Government funding, each organization must initially 
make a budget request before a closed meeting of the Senate Fi
nance Committee. Sooner or later, the revised budget is brought to a 
final vote on the Senate floor. If you have a curiosity as to how your 
share of $52,000 is liquidated, catch the next meeting of Stu

Elections for Student Govern
ment and College Council will be 
held next Monday and Tuesday, 
March 8 and 9. In addition, next 
Wednesday the League of Women 
Voters will be registering stu
dents 18 and over to vote in the 
federal elections.
The polls for campus elections 
will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

simplify voting, election machines donated by the Allegheny 
County Election Bureau will be 
used. Polls will be located in 
Baker Hall, Lobby, Skibo Lounge

Since it is expecting a change 
in the Pennsylvania election law 
sometime within the next two or 
three weeks, the League of Wom
en Voters is urging all residents 
of Allegheny County who are over 
18 to register to vote. Congress 
has already authorized all United 
States citizens 18 or over to vote 
in federal elections. This means 
that students born between May

nance Committee Chairman Steve 
Borth announced a time limit on 
discussions.
And by the end of the meeting, 
Senate had voted to table all 13 of 
the Committees recommenda
tions until next Tuesdays Senate 
meeting. Finance Committee will 
meet this Sunday to reconsider its 
suggestions for appropriations.
ACTIVITIES BOARD
During the meeting Activities 
Board Director Bill Iacono called 
the Finance Committees cutting 
arbitrary. He pointed out that 
when one week ago he went be
fore the Committee to present his 
budget, its members had not 
questioned his proposed budget, 
nor suggested to him that it would 
be cut.
TARTAN Editor Dave Caney 
echoed Iaconos remarks, point
ing out that no objections to the 
TARTANs budget were made at 
his meeting with the Finance 
Committee.
Caney explained that a 20 per 
cent cut in the TARTAN budget 
would mean a 40 page reduction
in next years paper and conse
quently, a $1,000 loss in advertis
ing revenues. This loss, he pointed out, was not taken into account in 
the Finance Committees revised 
version of the Tartan budget.
Caney also remined the Senate 
that last year the TARTAN vol
untarily trimmed its budget by 
$5,000.
WRCT SPEAKS
Representatives from WRCT 
defended their request for a $2,- 
000 tape machine, and used a lis
tener survey as evidence of their 
service to the campus commun
ity. In 1967, they told the Senate, 
C-MU students listened to WRCT 
less than they did to any other 
Pittsburgh radio station. But to
day, they continued, WRTC is 25 
per cent more popular on campus 
than any other Pittsburgh radio 
station.
SCHOOL SPIRIT?
SPIRIT suffered a 50 per cent 
cut in its budget; and the Revolu
tionary Alliance was totally de
subsidized. Finance Committee 
members explained they de-subsidized the Alliance because of 
its political function. The ques
tion of what is a political organ
ization then arose and appeared 
likely to consume the entire 
meeting when the Senate chair
mans gavel expertly squelched 
the question as irrelevant.
It should be remembered that 
the Finance Committees budget 
allocations are not final and are 
subject to Senate approval.
Finance Committee Chairman 
Borth concluded the days budget 
discussion with a scorching re
proval of his committees mem
bers for expressing purely parti
san opinions in their allocations 
of Senate funds.
Borth also critized those mem
bers of the Senate who neglected 
the protection of their vested in
terests by not taking the time to 
attend Finance Committee meet
ings to defend their causes.
(For a comple list of Budget al
locations, see the box accompany
ing this story.)
In other business, the Senate 
gave recognition to the Students 
International Meditation Society 
of Carnegie-Mellon University as 
a student activity.
CONCLUSION
Jerry Glaser presented a mo
tion that no student organization 
may restrict its membership ac
cording to race, color, creed (or 
most reduntantly of all) national 
origin. Glaser also moved that no 
recognized student organization 
may use its name to reserve 
space on campus for any other 
organization.
Both motions were tabled and 
after two and one-half hours the 
meeting came to close.

TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR 
TARTAN
from H. G. STEVER
Recognizing the growing con
cern for the problems and needs 
of women in this academic com
munity, I am establishing a cam
pus-wide Commission to explore 
the current status of women at 
Carnegie-Mellon University and 
am giving the Commission the fol
lowing charge:
(1) To examine all areas of Uni
versity operations as they per
tain to the general problem of the 
>tatus of women including: (a) 
the admission of women students 
both undergraduate and graduate, 
the placement services available 
to such students, the housing of 
women students, their treatment 
in the classroom, the educational 
and occupational counseling they
eceive, and such other areas as 
he Commission may determine;
b) the employment, retention, 
>romotion, and salaries of wom
en on the faculty and staff, the 
iistribution of males and females 
n various employment categories 
aid such other matters as the 
ommission may determine.
(2) To recommend policies, pro
cures, organizational arrangenents and special services which 
t believes will enhance the oportunities of women to achieve 
heir personal and professional 
jals at Carnegie-Mellon Univery.
(3) To suggest the outlines of an
 ffirmative action program de
igned to correct or ameliorate 
ny discriminatory practices or 
nequal conditions discovered in 
ie Commissions study.
(4) To recommend a continuing 
chicle for monitoring the imple
mentation of an affirmative ae
on program and to suggest which 
ffices within the University 
hould be responsible for various 
spects of implementation.
The Commission is expected to 
xamine areas of University oprations related to the general 
'oblem, to secure pertinent inrmation from all University ofifes, to gather such data as it
After a long period of inactivity, 
the Educational Policy Council 
has taken a giant step forward in 
the area of academic reform. At 
its meeting on Monday, the EPC 
passed two motions which should 
contribute highly to the difficult 
and diffuse area of improving 
teaching effectiveness. After ini
tially tabling a motion by Psychol
ogy Professor Jim Korn, the coun
cil gained headway by passing a 
motion of Pat Cavanagh concern
ing innovative teaching, then re
turned to unanimously approve 
Korns proposal for monitoring 
teaching effectiveness.
Cavanaghs motion stated that 
each college should be requested 
to present a summary and eval
uation of innovative teaching that 
has been attempted within the col
iege. These reports should be 
published annually. It was felt 
that this procedure would bring 
pressure to the different depart
ments to try new methods of 
teaching. It would also provide a 
reference for faculty members 
who could see which new methods 
have worked in the past, along 
with which new methods failed.
The proposal by Jim Korn es
tablishes a monitoring system 
for present departmental policies 
on teaching and also states that 
an evaluation of these policies be 
published each year. His motion 
was:
1. Educational Policy Coun
cil should publish an annual cata
log of procedures used for eval
uating teaching as presented by 
the various colleges.

The liberalization of abortion 
laws in New York has done much 
more than emancipate the wom
an from the burden of an unwant
ed child. In yet another upsurge of 
capitalistic endeavor, the New 
York abortion referral service 
have presented the facade of ex
cellent counsel, covering, in real
ity, a true rook.
The TARTAN is one of a multi
tude of campus newspapers that 
has stopped printing advertise
ments for these New York agen
cies. Referral services use stu
dent publications almost exclu
sively as their advertising media 
and arrange legal abortions in 
New York. The pitfalls begin 
when the pocketbook is involved 
their fees range way above the 
hundred dollar line, not including 
the cost of the doctor and actual 
surgery.

quested to present summary des
criptions of these procedures and 
the nature and kinds of evidence 
that they normally utilize in eval
uating teaching effectiveness.
3. EPC should prepare an an
nual evaluation of these proceddures and criteria as a basis for: 
a. Suggestions to colleges, and b. 
Consideration by the university 
level promotion committees.
4. A standing subcommittee of 
EPC should be appointed to carry 
out item three.

Director Taylor, is as yet an ex
perimental phase at C-MU (a sim

year full swing at Duquesne Uni

and finances permit, the program 
is slated to be expanded in the 
near future.
Richard Lohmeyer, performs a 
unique security function: on Wednesday through Saturday night he 
brings a measure of security to 
the computer center in Scaife 
Hall. As of Feb. 3 Rick has been
recording the name of everyone 
who enters or leaves Scaife Hall 
between the hours of 10 p.m. 
and 2 a.m. It is hoped that this will 
greatly reduce or altogether eli
minate the rash of incidents 
which have plagued recent com
puter center history. Projections 
hint at an extension of this signin service to other campus facil
ities, notably to the fine arts 
building.
The remaining three security 
aids, Wayne Bingham, Christo
pher Dayman, and Mark Krauland are employed to patrol the 
campus. They are to perform in a 
detection rather than an enforce
ment capacity, being on a con
stant alert for fires, assaults, or 
suspicious situations. Upon per
ceiving turbulence they will radio 
the desk and otherwise alert the 
appropriate enforcement officers. 
After completion of the security 
separtments first aid course, the 
three will, on occasion, help to 
man the ambulance van. They are 
presently available, upon request 
to the security office, to perform 
escort duties.

NO EXIT 
Jean Paul Sartres No Exit 
is the Chatham College Drama 
Departments March production. 
There is No Exit from Hell, 
where three characters have been 
thrown together to be eternally 
punished for the sins they com
mitted during their lives. Sartre, 
of course does not treat sin in a 
conventional manner, nor is his 
hell one of racks, whips and live 
coals. Each of the three char
acters has, indeed, committed a 
conventional sin: cowardice, les
bianism, infanticide. But it is not 
for these sins only that Garcin, 
Inez, and Estelle are punished. 
They are made to suffer forever 
for their inability to experience 
themselves except when someone 
else is watching them, and for 
their inability to act without 
treating other persons as objects 
looking glasses, in which their 
own images are reflected. The 
hell which exists for the three, 
and from which ther is No 
Exit, is a comfortable drawing 
room, and for each of the char
acters, the only objects of tor
ture are the other two.
The cast for Chathams pro
duction of No Exit includes 
Thomas Markham, a student 
from the University of Pitts
burgh, as Garcin; Caryl Opshinsky, a Chatham junior has the 
part of Estelle; Susan ONeil, 
a sophomore at Chatham, plays 
Inez; and Karen Soria, a Chath
am freshman, has the part of the 
Attendant (Valet). The director 
is Jack Neeson of the Drama 
Department.
No Exit will be performed

by SALLY GREENBERG 
Poetry No. 1
Why must you smother men?
Coat me with down, lest you 
bruise
On my sharp edges; set me 
among pillows 
Lest I whet my blade. Your 
Paper-filled eyes stare to see if 
I know
Of the jagged snow where growest pride
And disdain; assurance and truth 
Are the fruit of the snows 
And laughter the blossom.
Why must you sap my blood? 
You parasites, your hungry mouths 
Drink me all into the voids of 
yourselves,
Distending your stomachs with 
my life-strength 
Until it shrinks and melts with
in you,
For I was not meant to be eaten.
You mindless murderers,
You bloody killers of motherless 
babes.

rent production of Catch Me 
If You Cana whodunnit aim
ed at the funnybonewill con
clude March 7 to be followed 
up four days later by one of 
Brenden Behans best playsThe 
Hostage.
With The Hostage, the 
local players have chosen what 
is probably Behans most rowdy, 
blistering, yet rollicking satire.
British actor Geoff Garland 
will re-create the starring role 
of Leslieone which won him offBroadways Obie award for 
best performance during the 
1961-62 theatre season in New 
York.
Ken Costigan will direct the 
play here at The Playhouse. He 
was assistant director of the offBroadway production which won 
Garland his Obie and which 
also won its own Obie for 
best production of the season.
The Hostage is as wild, as 
unpredictable, as unstuffy and 
as unruly as its authora play
wright whose boisterous drink
ing earned him the dubious dis
tinction of being Irelands own 
Pecks Bad Boy.
It is basically concerned with 
the plight of a young British 
soldier (Played by Garland) 
who has been captured by the 
underground Irish Republican 
Army (IRA) and is being 
held hostage for an IRA mem
ber due to be hanged for shoot
ing a policeman.
Behans setting for the play is 
a seamy, seedy lodging house 
inhabited by a collection of dis
reputable characters of the low

irreverent group that Behan uses 
to frame all the moral cliches

Jacques Loussier Trio to Perform 
Unique Jazz Improvization of Bach
by TERENCE N. PALSO
The worst sin that can be 
committed in the modern 
American culture happens to be 
the one that can least be avoid
edgrowing old. In a society 
where half of the population is 
under thirty there is little room 
for anyone who cannot keep up 
with the pace of living. There 
is even less room for someone 
who slows down the pace of 
those around him. To clear the 
stragglers out of the way soci
ety pensions them off and then 
ships them to retirement com
munities or rest homes where 
they can wait for death.
As years go by what used to 
be referred to as the blessings 
of a long life turn into a curse 
seemingly inflicted by a cruel, 
sadistic Supreme Being. After 
retirement a man has very little 
to look forward to. Even read
ing a newspaper can become a 
depressing experience for as the 
months go by the names of 
more and more friends appear 
in the death notices until sud
denly they stop, and the realiza
tion that there are no more 
cronies left begins to manifest 
itself. No more friends, no more 
of the old gang, no one left 
who can call a man by his 
first name. These realizations 
coupled with the physical and 
mental deterioration which is 
a natural part of the aging pro
cess serve to make life far less 
than comfortable not only for 
those who reach that stage, but 
also for those who must decide 
between making their parents 
last days comfortable or seek
ing the fulfillment and happi
ness to which they have a right.
In I Never Sang For My 
Father Melvin Douglas por
trays an eighty-year-old-man 
who finds himself in the posi
tion of becoming a burden to 
his son, who would like to move 
away to get married and es
cape the memory of his deceas
ed first wife.
Douglas finds himself no long
er entrusted with the position of 
importance his business gave 
him. Afraid to look ahead, he 
contents himself with existing 
in the past among the mem
ories of former struggles, hard 
times, successes and happinesses 
while all but ignoring what is 
taking place around him. A 
proud man, he refuses to admit 
even to himself that he is no long
er able to keep up the hustle with 
which he has occupied his exis
tence. Frightened, he realizes 
that he must reach out, but he has 
never done so, and he does not 
know how to now. He tries to 
build upon the relationship 
he has with his son, but this 
relationship has existed more in 
his timemellowedmemories 
than in reality.
Douglas uses his considerable 
acting abilities to their fullest 
n this role. Almost every time 
that he is on the screen he 
controls the scene. Douglas does 
more than simply act his part, 
he makes it come alive. He is 
not just a character; he becomes 
the quintessential senior citizen, 
and this perhaps may be what 
makes I Never Sang For My 
Father such a disturbing motion 
picture. As Douglas developes 
his role one can easily spot 
characteristics common to grand
parents, parents, and older rela
tives.
Gene Hackman portrays Doug
las son and in doing so once 
again reveals the talent he has 
not drawn upon since he play
ed Buck Barrow in Bonnie 
and Clyde. Hackman does 
everything possible to make his
role believable, and to a good 
extent succeeds in spite of the 
difficulties imposed upon him 
by the screenplay.
It is in the screenplay that the 
greatest flaw in the film appears 
to lie. Adapted from his play, 
Robert Andersons script con
centrates on developing the char
acter of the father while seeming
ly ignoring that of the son. 
True, the audience is given 
glimpses of the sons personal 
life, but his relationship with his 
father is not really developed 
enough to convince them that 
there is really something worth 
striving to hold on to. When 
the son states that some of his 
fathers remarks irritate him and 
provoke his anger, the audience 
must believe him, for little of 
what they have seen would lead 
them to that conclusion. When 
the son contemplates placing his 
father in a rest home and tours 
those in the area, the audience 
can feel his resentment and hor
ror of such places, but they 
would have felt this had they 
just been shows the film clips 
and not known the story.
Supposedly this film is told 
from the sons point of view, 
and yet the audience leaves the 
theater far more familiar with 
the fathers views and motiva
tions. Unfortunately, the father is 
the only character in the film 
who constantly inhabits three 
dimensions. While the other 
characters enter into this realm 
at times, it appears that Ander
son either could not or would 
not make them come com
pletely alive.
Director Gilbert Cates appears 
to have elicited the best per
formances possible from his 
actors in spite of the material 
which he had to work with. 
Wisely Cates chose to present 
his motion picture in a lowkeyed manner instead of opting 
for the type of pacing that cre
ates carthartic tear-jerkers. Un
fortunately, however, Cages 
does not seem to be in full con
trol of his vehicle. He permits 
segments to bog down and ap
pears to have stuck a little too 
close to the screenplay in rely
ing upon narration to inform the 
audience of something which 
could have more easily been pre
sented in additional sequences 
or flashbacks. By trimming se
quences and replacing them with 
others, Cates could have easily 
made a much tighter film and 
still kept his pacing.
Despite its flaws and the fact 
that the film really doesnt ex
amine what it is supposed to 
the relationship of an elderly 
father to his middle age son 
I Never Sang For My Father 
is well worth seeing for the 
excellent performances of 
Melvyn Douglas and Gene 
Hackman as well as for the intel
ligent look it takes at a problem 
which in one way or another 
more people are going to run 
up against as medical science 
helps us to survive in order that 
we may become old and lonely.
On April 2, the Activities Board 
will be presenting the Jacques 
Loussier Trio at Carnegie Music 
Hall.
The program this trio does is 
called Play Bach. It is a fine, 
if somewhat unexpected synthesis 
of jazz and Bach. Loussier, a fine 
classical pianist, has chosen 
Christian Garros and Pierre Michelot because they were world reby MICHAEL JOHN HARBADIN
After the Blues Project record
ed their last album, Planned Obso
lescence, they changed their name 
and some of their personnel and 
recorded an album for A&M, call
ed Seatrain. Dissatisfied with the 
results they again reformed under 
the guidance of bassist Andy Kulberg and violinist Richard Greene 
who put together the fine band 
which is heard on their new re
lease for Capital, entitled Seatrain.
This album combines the five 
distinct musical influences of its 
members into a musically tight 
and cohesive sound which retains 
an amazing impact along with its 
incredible diversity. George Mar
tin, formerly the Beatles pro
ducer, has succeeded in capturing 
the essence of Seatrain by add
ing only the most subtle and use
ful augumentation to the bands 
basic sound.
Bill Price, engineer, has also 
done an extremely sensitive and 
balanced mixing of the album, 
which is one of its strong points. 
Eight original tracks and three 
other tracks, including the tradi
tional bluegrass-country Orange 
Blossom Special, comprise the 
album.
In an interview here on Feb. 20, 
Kulberg, guitarist Peter Rowan, 
and lyricist Jim Roberts indi
cated that a stronger thematic 
premise would be evident in the 
next album and even hinted at re
making Rowans old Earth Opera 
album, American Eagle Tragedy.
An emphasis of theme, plus a
nowned as the best French jazz 
drummer and bassist, respective
ly.
Loussier is reaching for a new 
approach to Bach . . . more than 
just a jazz version, but rather a 
true contemporary improvisation of the original music.
Play Bach concerts have 
drawn SRO crowds all across 
Europe since 1964. The trio has
stronger evidence of Rowans gui
tar and Lloyd Baskins keyboard 
work, which is now shadowed by 
the brillance of Greens violin 
work, would be two welcomed 
improvements for future record
ings. It would be nice to hear Kulbergs flute, also, which had been 
silent during the recording of this 
latest album.
What About Me/Quicksilver
If youre a Quicksilver freak, 
then youll like this new album, 
which features a horn section and 
percussion, Nicky Hopkins deft 
and funky piano, and too much of 
Dino Valentis nasal voice. Hop
kins shines through on Spindrifter, a lyrical if not inspired piano 
piece.
In all, the album is badly bal
anced, a fault of both the band and 
the mix engineers and producers. 
The intangible quality that makes 
Quicksilver a fine band is some
how lost on this effort. The tracks 
are reportedly taken from the 
same sessions that produced Just 
tor Love, their last album. It seems 
that the best tracks were put into 
Just for Love and the leftovers into 
What About Me. If youre looking 
to complete your Quicksilver 
collection, Just for Love is just 
the thing.
Silverbird/ Silver bird
Seven full-blooded Indians, six 
male and one female, comprise 
this band. Actually, they are more 
of a vocal group (only two of them 
play guitar) and they produce 
some very beautiful and haunting 
counterpointing and melodic vocal 
lines comprised of the usual lead 
and backups, plus some chanting.
Their vocal ability is their 
strongest point, yet it provides a 
small problem when recording, 
necessitating the abilities of a 
back up band, an arranger and an 
orchestra. But, nowadays, who 
doesnt use these things and those 
oeople?.
The problem with Silverbird is 
the way they are utilized. When I 
first listened to the album, I imag
ined a big record producer with
also played in North Africa and 
the Far East and are now making 
their second tour of the U.S. and 
Canada. The trio has been award
ed three European gold records.
Tickets for the Jacques Lous
sier Trio will be available Mon
day, March 8. The price will be 
$3.50 for non-students, $2.50 for 
students and $1.50 for C-MU stu
dents with an ID.
long sideburns and executive hipclothes saying, Well, well, well, 
weve got seven Indian kids . . . 
can they speak English? Good, 
good. Hmmmm . . . lets see . . .

vey Bernstein.
Harv? Whatdya think baby? 
Lotta strings, yeah. . . . Arrang
er, yeah . . . whole production 
thing, right? Gotcha sweetie . . . 
bye. So Harvey gets the new 
group an orchestra, some guy 
named Tony Camila to arrange it 
and lays a whole mess of strings 
in back over, under, and around 
the kids. On some songs the 
strings are effective, but mostly 
they muddle and garbage up the 
sound. One of the best examples 
of overproducing to date.
Harv? Great job, sweetie! 
Some of the orchestra themes 
sound as if they were taken out of 
the dance - around - the - war - firescenes from an old Gary Cooper 
western. I think they even got a 
white chick to pose for the cover 
photo, complete with feathers and 
all. She doesnt look red to me.
However, through all of the 
blatant commercialism and hype 
that the album carries, the free
dom and purity of the music man
ages to shine through, revealing 
the talent and sensitivity of the 
group.
You can just feel the convic
tion: Go to any reservation to
day and you will plainly see/An 
honest-to-goodness ghetto/And a 
people who remember/When they 
really were free. The honesty 
of Silverbirds music rises above 
the pre-packaged commercialism 
of their producers and proves its 
point even further. Mr. Record 
Producer trys to exploit the In
dian thing (Take my word, 
Harv, Red Power is going to be 
the IN Thing this year!) and 
the kids just sit back and laugh 
and sing it off. Lets hope they 
learn enough about the record in
dustry to be able to produce their 
next album themselves.
Its a good, honest album. Buy 
it and find out how the Forgotten 
Americans!' really feel.

Over the next year the Academ

Continue to seek appropriate 
student/faculty representation 
on college and departmental
committees.
Explore the possibilities of an 
appeal mechanism for grades 
and other academic matters.
Initiate a study of new teaching 
techniques, evaluation of old

specific situations, hopefully 
leading to the establishment of 
a university Educational Re
search Institute.
Explore the possibility of stu
dent involvement, related to 
major, in surrounding commun
ities as part of the educational 
experience.
In addition to seeking reform in 
the established educational sys
tem, there is need to explore al
ternatives, such as a free-form 
student directed college open to 
all students and surrounding com
munities. Areas of study would 
be determined by students, with 
persons inside and outside the 
university being approached to 
donate their services in teaching, 
some already having expressed 
an interest in doing so.

Plans for Future:
1. Continued and expanded use of 
the Academic Affairs Board 
for mediating student and fac

2. Investigate new learning and 
teaching techniques.
3. Budget for the AAB to allow in
creased publicity.
4. Further student input is wel
come. The continued effective
ness of the office depends on 
student support and contact. I 
feel that I can continue to be ef
fective as director due to mv 
experience in the position, my extensive contact with student 
groups, and a very good work

Vince Misitano is in the lead in 
the race for Student Government 
president. He is the only candi
date. Dennis Brandt, candidate 
for president of the Carnegie 
Commuter Council, is also run
ning unopposed. The race for the 
director of Academic Affairs 
Board may prove interesting with 
John Messervy challenging in
cumbent Terri Zaluska.
Vicious competition is devel
oping in the race for Senate seats 
in the fraternity and MDC con
stituencies. Eleven candidates 
are vying for the four fraternity 
seats, while eight dorm candi
dates contend for their three open 
seats.
The contest among commuter 
candidates is not as keen, with 
only five people running for four

five women are running. And 
theres plenty of room for writein votes in the Graduate constitu

In addition to the candidates 
for Student Government, students 
will also be choosing their repre

Barron Broomfield
The Senate should appropriate 
funds to diverse groups in order 
to enable the student to become a 
part of mankind. Since college is 
more than books and classes, the 
student should be encouraged to 
organize groups according to his 
bent so that he can alleviate the 
boredom of C-MU and learn to 
communicate with other people. 
I am in favor of appropriating 
money to groups whose purposes 
I oppose since everybody should 
have the right to express them
selves.
Bruce Hoffman
As a freshman running for Stu
dent Senate, Im afraid my back
ground as far as the University is 
concerned, is limited, but I feel 
my capabilities and experiences ^ 
in similar organizations make me 
a good candidate. Thus, I ask your 
support.
Michael Jones
I support:
1. People fighting for their rights.
2. U.S. out of Indochina.
3. Making student government and 
the student body responsive to 
national as well as campus is
sues.
4. Establishing a day care center 
on campus.
5. Establishing an effective way of 
recycling the campus used pa
per and bottles.
6. Recognizing any organization 
on campus regardless of its 
politics.
We can make it better. I would 
like to see more co-ed dorms, an 
effective birth control clinic, co
operation rather than competi
tion through student co-operative 
programs such as Day Care, rec
ognition of all campus organiza
tions, and Peace now in Vietnam, 
Cambodia, and Laos.
Joel Hynek
As an incumbent candidate, I 
have had experience in the Sen
ate, and both the the Rules and Fi
nance Committees. I am still dis
satisfied with many of the actions 
of Student Senate, but I will con
tinue to work to improve that or
ganization, especially in regard 
to the granting of Senate funds.
Carl Saurman, Jr.
In view of the recent incorpora
tion of the Student Senate, it will 
now play an increasingly impor
tant role in campus affairs. This 
role will be manifested in new ap
proaches to student housing and 
security problems. I believe that 
this added responsibility necessi
tates the involved participation 
of responsible students.
Harry Sirockman
Willie Roy Thompson
We need in our University:
1. Less stringent course require
ments.
2. Greater choice of electives 
outside of our particular col
lege.
3. Increased social activity out
side of our particular college.
4. Careful allocation of Student 
Government funds.
Student Government has the 
ability to achieve these goals. Im 
willing to try. ARE YOU?

FRATERNITY CANDIDATES
JOHN BELLIn the slightly more 
than three semesters that I have 
been here I was always told that 
the fraternities were the leaders 
of the campus. I can, at the pre
sent, not believe that. We have 
grown too introspective and have 
allowed a new governing group to 
emerge. We must regain the 
stature that is ours.
MARK F. WINTERSC-MUs fra
ternity community must take an 
active role in leadership of cam
pus activities. To assume this 
position I propose to have the sys
tem cooperate with my house, Pi 
Kappa Alpha, which will serve 
as collection center for the re
cycling of used cans and bottles.
ALAN DIGNON  Having spent 
time in Senate, I feel that I know 
some of its weaknesses, one of 
which is that it is not realistic 
enough. Hopefully, we can make 
Senate a more realistic and rele
vant force on this campus.
MARTIN HOLLANDERI feel that I 
can best represent the fraternity 
constituency because I am a 
member of an impartial house and 
can take an unbiased view on what 
is best for the fraternity system.
JEFF LA ROCHELLEAs a senator 
I will strive to strengthen the re
lationship between the fraterni
ties and Student Government by 
endeavoring to increase the conmunication between both bodies. 
I feel that an exchange of atti
tude and efficient communica
tion is essential to the livelihood 
of both the fraternities and Stu
dent Government. Neither body 
can afford to continue the prob
lems of communication and 
scheduling that have been evi
dent throughout the past year. 
Lastly, as a senator, I will en
deavor to represent the whole 
fraternity system and not the de
sires of any single house.
STEPHEN A. MACKOThe Senator 
from the fraternity must work 
for the following goals: better 
recognition by the school that fra
ternities ARE fraternities and 
MUST NOT be treated as dormi
tories; better allocation of funds 
through organizational purpose 
and need; and better communi
cation of fraternity ideas to the 
school through its Senate.
RONALD PALMER1 favor: equal 
representation of large and small 
fraternities; the establishment of 
an effective birth control clinic; 
more co-ed dorms and possibly 
co-ed fraternities; and longer 
hours for Health Service. I will 
support peace and equal opportun
ity groups and the right of all stu
dent groups and the right of all 
student groups to establish a 
campus organization.
ANDREW PILLETA representa
tive must work with the system. I 
have gained experience working 
through the system as a mem
ber of Freshman Cabinet and as 
an active member of the Admin
istration and Managerial Science 
Council. My interest in improving 
the student community and my 
qualifications make me your can
didate for Student Senate.
RICHARD SANDUSKYI am run
ning for Senate because I think 
that the fraternities should take 
a more active part in campus ac
tivities. I feel that my fraternity 
participation in house and cam
pus activities such as Mens Dorm 
Council, Freshman Orientation, 
and ASCE has given me the ex
perience necessary to handle the 
Senate position. If anyone wants 
to talk with me about what they 
think Senate should be doing, 
please call me at 621-1024.
MIKE STEVENSSome of the ad
jectives that label fraternities at 
C-MU are beer-guzzling, jock, 
chauvinist (very in these days) 
and redneck. Id like to add rad
ical. Rather than always com
peting, how about some interfraternity cooperation? Then 
maybe we can get rid of all our 
labels and help ourselves, the stu
dents, and the school at large  I 
want to work in Student Senate 
for these ends.
DON DIETRICHStudent Government has a poor set of priorities; 
too little money is spent on activ
ities the MAJORITY of students 
can enjoy. Security on this cam
pus, as witnessed by events last 
semester, is usually a tragic 
farce. Ill work to reverse both these trends. Help me turn down 
the gas at C-MU.

Michael J. Garl
In my first year as senator, I 
became involved with the incor
poration of Student Government. 
Two weeks ago incorporation be
came a reality. In the next year, I 
hope to help the corporation serve 
the students of Carnegie-Mellon.
Myron Staroschak
I pledge to increase student
happiness by:
1. Promoting those activities that 
illusion of enormous personal 
significance.
2. Working to strengthen those 
channels that allow a tempor
ary escape from non-entity.
3. Creating noble programs that 
would allow the morally moti
vated to satisfy their yearning 
for importance.
Arnold Millard
I believe in the equality of all 
people and groups of people, as 
people. Therefore, I will work to 
end discrimination by race, sex, 
or wealth. Co-operation is the 
means to true freedoms. I favor 
student-owned and operated hous
ing, a birth control clinic, and a 
worker-student co-operation pro
ject.
I want to work with Student 
Government on its projects. My 
main interest is to provide oncampus facilities and services. I 
hope to present ideas directed to
ward that interest and to work on 
projects so oriented.
Joan (Jak) Kodish
Sophomore, History/English
Having already served on Stu
dent Senate and its rules commit
tee for the past year, I am aware 
of the many worthwhile contribu
tions Student Government makes 
to the campus as both subsidizer 
and spokesman for the student 
body. However, individual groups 
need a better opportunity for dia
logue and subsequent action and 
Senate, itself, needs to untangle 
from its procedural red-tape.
Experience:
City-Wide Student Council (1969- 
70), State Wide Student Council 
(1969-70), Student Council and 
Cabinet, a) president (1969-70), 
b) recording secretary (1968- 
69), c) Member (1967-68).
The Student Council of Cass 
Technical High School in Detroit 
(under which I served) is the gov
erning body of 4,800 students in 
the school.
Platform:
It is my goal to better inform 
those of my constituency of Stu
dent Government activities and 
decisions and to take an active 
part in an effort to fulfill the needs 
of the students.
Leigh Larson
Since I have lived in a dorm and 
also off campus, I have become 
aware of some of the facilities 
and services that should be avail
able to all C-MU women. With 
your suggestions and my own 
experience (service on a commit
tee of the Educational Policy 
Council), I hope to be able to rep
resent our interests in the Senate.
Arnold
GRADUATE
I have served on Senate for one
year and believe that Senate
should continue to:
1. Serve the interests of all stu
dents with programs such as 
the Abortion Loan Fund and 
Statement of Students Rights.
2. Support ALL student groups.
3. Maintain relevant contact with 
the outside community.
4. Define the role and rights of stu
dents.
5. Promote useful changes in our 
own education.

I am running on a platform f0r 
increased commuter involvement in school activities. I want to in
crease the room allotted to commuters in Skibo.
Evelyne Pohl
My active participation in Cam
eron Choir, Cheerleading, a sor
ority and the yearbook put me in 
constant contact with a wide va
riety of students. I feel that I can 
ably represent the views of these 
students, at the same time seek
ing the opportunity to meet new 
people and hear new opinions.
Judy Parkman
Student Senate should stop play
ing sandbox and concern itself 
with issues such as the People's 
Peace Treaty, a free day care 
center for children of students, 
faculty, and staff, the inclusion of 
abortion and maternity benefits 
in student health insurance at a 
reasonable price, land student 
owned and operated housing.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOREditorial
I
Everyone involved with Student Government or its major 
organizations has had the experience of sitting with a group of 
his or her super-sophisticate, spiritually enlightened, executive 
material, or good time joe (think up your own adjective for 
yourself and insert here) acquaintances, and letting it slip that 
he or she works on the organizations, then being greeted with 
either derisive laughter or strained silence, both of which are 
habitually followed by a condescending discourse on what an 
irrelevant waste of time Student Government and student ac
tivities are; how, after all, can one stand all those deluded egotripping, bureaucrats, etc.
Of course, these exchanges are also habitually accompanied 
by bitching and moaning about how dull it is here, or about how 
abismal ones courses are, or the existential anguish of a de
personalized society, etc. But I wont dwell on this because its 
been said before, and because all who have participated in such 
encounters are aware of the pathetic sheep-like quality of those 
who think concerts, dances, movies, good or bad food, housing, 
health care, educations, and decisions are just made mysteri
ously elsewhere.
Actually, most people who are active in the various projects 
ignominiously labeled student activities are more than aware 
of the time wasting, ego-tripping aspects of the whole pile, and 
at times, like this week, are discouraged by them. It is very 
easy to treat this place like an educational automat, coming in 
and taking whats here out of various pigeon holes, while living 
a separate, disassociated life. But that is a trap, because it sets 
you up to live like that for the rest of your life. The average 
American family moves every four to five years. Youre here, 
on the average, as long as youll be any place. If you dont have 
a sense of community here, you probably never will. It is al
ways strange to hear someone say, Oh, well, I just want to be 
a teacher, or Oh, well, Im going to work for Omnidyne, or 
I just want to be a such and such, as if that person had said, 
Oh, Im going to Antarctica. A part of your education should 
be, MUST be, learning to live WITH, not just among people.
But, of course, nobody knows how or wants to teach you 
that. And besides, its extracurricular. But one way you start 
is by taking responsibility for the quality of the community you 
live in, and rigljt now there are a lot of potential tools and 
mechanisms lying around going begging to be used for just such 
a purpose. Maybe they wont work well in their present form 
(especially in their present form) but they are there.
You can dismiss this as just another sermon about involve
ment, but try thinking about it in terms of whether human con
tact is good or not, whether you want it or not, whether or not 
you want to do something about the quality or quantity of it in 
your daily life. But then maybe all you people out there are just 
blissfully happy already, in which case ignore this. If not, now 
is the time to start lining things up for next year.
II
Seeing as we are committed to bringing out an issue next 
week, and seeing as vacation has been moved up to the day of 
publication, meaning that there wont be many students around 
to read it, I thought it would be nice to devote the next issue to 
the faculty and staff. So if any of you non-students out there 
would like to write something, publicize a project or event, com
ment or gripe, please bring it in (to the Info Desk in Skibo or un
der our door), by next Tuesday, and well see if we can put to
gether something that will help people get together over vaca
tion.

Job Hunt
Editor, The TARTAN:
As many seniors and graduate 
students are doing, my wife and 
I are applying for jobs for the 
coming year. We hope to be go
ing for interviews over the 
Spring recess, and have coordin
ated our applications so that this 
is possible; that is with the ex
ception of our transcripts.
In applying for jobs one must 
have transcripts sent from your 
university, a service that should 
be rendered readily, but it seems 
that there is a problem at our 
registrars office.
I have had no problem in the 
past having transcripts sent, but 
today (March 1) I was told that 
I could not have my transcript 
order taken over the phone; I 
would either have to come in 
person or they could send me 
an official order blank.
When I asked why, the secre
tary told me she was too busy. 
When I told her I had three 
transcripts sent the previous week 
with no problem, she replied 
she could not help me. I then 
spoke to the Assistant to the 
Registrar, who claimed that they 
have never taken transcript or
ders over the phone. I then tried 
to speak to Mr. Rogers. I was 
told that he was out to lunch, 
and that he only comes in for 
special occasions (fund rais
ing dinners perhaps?) Now an
noyed, I requested an appoint
ment with him.She informed me 
that she could not make such 
an appointment, nor was there 
anyone I could speak to who 
could. Finally she took my name 
and telephone number and said 
he would call me. (I am not 
holding my breath)
This all took over 25 minutes. 
It would have taken less than five 
if the secretary simply took my 
order.
When jobs are scarce, one 
makes application to many places. 
Requesting, filing our appli
cations, taking graduate courses 
and tutoring all take up a great 
deal of my time.
I have graduated in both 
English and architecture, and 
now am a graduate student in 
English. I have attended CMU 
for almost seven years. It seems 
to me that the least this school 
can do for its students is to 
sent out transcripts of grades 
to the places they request 
in the manner that is most con
venient to most people.
I will only mention in pass
ing the cost of the transcript. 
In regard to the rising cost of 
tuition, access to the records of 
ones education ought to be free.
Most sincerely, 
Emery Roth II

Editor, The TARTAN:
A great many questions have 
been asked lately concerning 
concerts at CMU. The Activities 
Board, on behalf of myself, is 
taking this opportunity to clarify 
a few points about Spring Car
nival, Homecoming and con
certs in general.
Programming concerts for the 
University community has always 
been a difficult and complex 
taskboth in satisfying diverse 
student tastes, and in obtaining 
a good performance at a reason
able price. The philosophy of 
the Activities Board has been 
to steer away from the expen
sive attractions who at best can 
appeal to a fraction of the 
campus population, and to em
phasize programming a DIVER
SITY of entertainment over the 
academic year. We have not at
tempted to bring groups that 
represent our personal interests, 
nor have we tried to orient our 
programs to particular interest 
groups. What we have tried to 
do is bring QUALITY enter
tainment that we feel those in 
attendance will enjoy or at least 
appreciate regardless of their in
dividual musical orientation. 
How well we have accomplished 
our ends is open to question.
I will be the first to admit that 
this has been a learning year 
for our two year old organization.
I will also be the first to de
fend the philosophy and prin
ciples of the Activities Board, 
in both the philosophy and 
principles of the Activities 
Board, in both past and future 
sponsored events. In addition to 
philosophical problems en
countered in campus program
ming, there are ethical business 
problems that influence Acti
vities Board policy, among them 
is the current dispute with the 
AF of M.
The American Federation of 
Musicians is an international 
labor union to which any per
former hoping to acquire record
ing contracts or achieve stardom 
must belong. Recently, the AF of 
put forth a rule forbidding any 
of its member agents to accept 
a contract with deletions or 
riders attached. The union recog
nizes as legitimate only their 
own form B contract which 
specifies only the name of the 
group the date and location of 
the performance, and the fee 
they will receive.
Experience has shown this 
contract to be insufficient to 
protect you, from the no-shows, 
the late shows, the appearances 
without the correct musicians, 
and the questionable financial 
practices that occur all to fre
quently. To afford you protec
tion against such occurrances, 
the CMU Activities Board has 
joined with 550 other colleges 
across the country in a non
profit organization known as the 
National Entertainment Confer
ence. The NEC is educational 
organization concerned about 
the rising costs of entertainment 
and related problems which col
leges face in presenting enter
tainment (concerts, speakers, films, 
etc.) on campus. Through the 
NEC, member colleges receive 
incaluable input on concert per
formers and their performances.
One of NECs most important 
functions has been the creation 
of the NEC contract rider. This 
rider is attached to every con
tract made between the Activi
ties Board and its concert per
formers. In short, the rider pro
tects you by legally binding the 
group to appear at the time 
agreed upon, with the speci
fic musicians agreed upon, to
play for the proper period of 
time, and to receive your money 
after, and only after, the per
formance has been completed 
as specified in the contract and 
rider.
1
The action taken by the AF of 
M is totally unacceptable, yet 
any booking agent who refuses 
to observe the ruling is subject 
to the loss of his union license 
and is simply forced out of busi
ness. The NEC has answered 
the AF of M with a law suit in 
hopes of blocking the unions 
action with a court injunction. 
Hopefully, the suit will be settl
ed in our favor, but during the 
interim, the refusal of CMU and 
member schools across the 
country to contract without the 
protection of the rider has made 
concert booking a very complex 
and difficult task.
In addition to this legal prob
lem, concert performers are ef
fectively pricing themselves out 
of the college markets. Specifi
cally, if we hold a concert in 
the Syria Mosque, sell all tickets 
at $5.00 (a price we consider to 
be high), and sell out the per
formance, we generate a work
ing income of about $16,000. Yet 
the Band, Blood, Sweat, and 
Tears, the Who, Three Dog 
Night Grand Funk, The Moody 
Blues, Jethro Tull, Mountain, 
Temptations, Led Zeppelin, just 
to name a few, receive a guaran
tee of $25,000 for a performance, 
Creedance Clearwater Revival 
demands $35,000. Simon and Garfunkel $40,000, and James Tayler, 
in his current tour, is personally 
being paid $750,000 which aver
ages a little over $30,000 a per
formance.
Who pays these acts such sums? 
Either large schools with 8,000 
seat plus auditoriums, small 
schools which absorb a large de
ficit, or as is most often the 
case, a promoter who has a local 
monopoly (as is the case in 
Pittsburgh).
This years concerts have pre
sented and will continue to pre
sent a variety of musical talent. 
Acquired under adverse circum
stances they represent a wide 
range of musical tastes and rep
resent as well some of the finest 
performers available today.

MDC ELECTIONS
On Monday night (March 1), 
the Men's Dormitory Council held 
elections for new officers. I am 
proud to announce that those 
who were selected are:
PresidentRandy Glen Olson 
Vice-PresidentLeonard Bell 
TreasurerLorry Tenebaum
Randy is a junior in mechanical 
engineer and has been involved 
with MDC for two years. This year 
he was one of my two cabinet 
members and chief advisors and 
was chief justice of Dormitory 
Court. One of his major immedi
ate goals, however, is to de-emphasize the relationship between 
MDC and the court.
Leonard, a C-MAP student, is a 
freshmen in chemical engineer
ing who became involved with 
the Men's Dormitory Council in 
September as a Hamerschlag 
House representative. He has 
been one of the two MDC appoin
tees to the Food Service Commit
tee.
Yet to be chosen are two cabi
net members who will have rigor
ously defined duties with regards 
to dealing with the administra
tion and other groups, co-ordina
tion of various MDC activities and 
publicity and public relations.
The new officers take office on 
March 8.

It's not music to weep, sigh or sniffle to.
But it's not merely happy-happy music either.
It is madly exhilarating, mind-blowing" music; 
a kind of planned, brilliant anarchy.
What a collection:
Loussier himself, like a restless anarchistic keyboard Picasso; 
bassist Pierre Michelot who has played with y0yeTASyq 
and drummer Christian Garros who roams at ease 
through the gamut of exotic percussionisms.
Within Bachs strong, beautifully mobile, familiar progressions
(he lived in an age of improvisation
and was himself one of its greatest exponents)
the three of them set up a fantastic firework display.
The Jacques Loussier Trio plays at playing music the way one 
imagines the gods playing at omnipotence.

She entered the church and 
sat in a silence which was 
not an end, but a means. In 
the encompassing quiet, as 
the world dropped away, she 
sought to reach God directly. 
Another seeker rose and 
spokeof love, of mans 
baseness to man, of Jesus, 
of other peacemakersof 
things he was deeply moved 
to say out of his sense of 
communion with God. Her 
mind enfolded the words, 
and in the following stillness, 
her own truths became more 
apparent, her strength re
newed to meet what lay 
ahead.
And afterwards, 
everyone shook hands.
There was no creed, no priest 
or minister, no prearranged 
order of service. Every 
Quaker meeting for worship 
is essentially a searchin 
which each man may come 
upon his own new truths and 
find answers to his problems.

COACH DAVID LICHTMAN
FINAL PREDICTIONS
There are basketball playoff 
this week marking the conclu
sion of the IM basketball program. 
The final game takes place Friday 
night at 7 p.m.
Only eight teams remain as 
contenders, so lets take a look at 
the matchups. Then next week I 
will explain why my predictions 
were wrong!
Pepper and Salt vs. ATO: This 
one is easy. Mullins and Sehlin 
were defeated in the semis last 
year but should have little trouble 
making the finals this time. ATO 
is strong with Weakland having a 
good year, however, the lack of 
organization which caused them 
to fall to SAE has not been resolv
ed. PredictionSalt and Pepper 
by 20.
Beta Theta Pi Obeah Men vs. 
Smoke B: The Obeah Men have 
played a tough schedule and have 
survived with only one loss at the 
hands of the Anvils. They have a 
solid backcourt leader in Tex Feibel and should be able to conquer 
the press which shook the Bruins. 
The battle for the boards will de
termine this game. For Smoke, 
Mr. Strong is about the finest ballhandler in the school. Prediction 
BTP by two.
SAE vs. Radics Raiders: The 
two Cinderella teams of the sea
son meet head on. SAE led by Mr.
Aber played a superb game against 
SN last week and should be able 
to maintain their momentum into 
another strong performance. The 
Raiders are basically a one man 
team. Mr. Putney brings the 
ball downcourt, shoots, and re
bounds when he misses. Unfor
tunately for the Raiders, five men 
usually can defeat onebut it 
will be close. There might even 
be an overtime or two! Predic
tionsSAE by three.
Anvils vs. E. J. Bruins: This 
one is the hardest to call because 
I'm personally involved. The An
vils can be incredibly strong or 
surprisingly weak. The same 
holds for the Bruins whose weak
ness was exposed last week by 
Smoke. The four-time defending 
champs have no depth. They are 
led by Burner, Apt and Beer in 
the scoring department with Majewski and McMillin rounding out 
a solid five, but the subs have not 
yet proven helpful. So watch Mark 
Lang, watch Terry Stalker and 
watch the foul situation for the 
Bruins.
To take this a step further, look 
for the winner of the Anvils vs. 
Bruins game to play in the finals 
against Salt and Pepper. On that 
matchup I wouldnt even attempt 
a guess. Just be there Friday 
night at 7 and enjoy some great 
basketball.

A NEW SCHOOL RECORD
while scoring 16 points in a los
ing effort against W&J. The 
sophomore transfer from Alle
gheny Community College let CMU scorers for the season with 
3% points for a 20.8 points per 
game average. Although Gene is 
only 59, he was second high re
bounder for the Tartans with 97 
for the season and his deft moves
and ball handling were a key fac
tor in the Tartans hustling style 
of play. Turner is a graduate of 
Oliver High School.
Final season record for Carnegie-Mellon was 6-13. In equalling 
last years number of wins firstyear coach Jim Brown achieved 
something of an accomplishment. 
Throughout much of the 1970-71 
season he started three players 
510 and under. He had only 
three returning lettermen and 
only one of them had been a regu
lar starter.
