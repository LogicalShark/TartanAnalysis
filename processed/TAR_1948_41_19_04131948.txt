Informal Dance Friday, May 14
Elliot Lawrence,. fast rising 
young bandleader and chief at
traction for Carnival Saturday, 
night.
29 Of Faculty 
Are Promoted
Elliot Lawrence will play for 
the Spring Carnival Saturdaynight formal dance on May 15.
Lawrence, cited many times 
during the past year as the 
most promising of the nations 
bandleaders, has risen to top 
ranking in less than two years.
For the informal dance on May 
14, Spring Carnival committee 
is bringing back t the campus 
the popular young piano player 
Skitch Henderson and his wellknown orchestra.
Hendersons piano and orchestra 
are doing a repeat performance at 
Carnegie Tech on the basis of their 
reception as last falls Junior 
Prom.
Both the Lawrence and Hender
son organizations are listed as 
big name bands, and have simi
lar histories. Taking advantage of 
their relative newness on the na
tional musical scene, they have 
reputations for playing sweet and 
for the crowd.
In the less than two years Law
rence has played almost every 
major band spot in the nation, 
been featured on all major radio 
networks, and appeared at over 
a hundred colleges and univer
sities. His record is 300 engage
ments in less than eighteen 
months.
In a recent poll by Billboard, 
trade magazine of the music 
world, college students voted El
liot Lawrence number one.
Skitch Henderson, like Law
rence, has come up fast in the 
last year. In the summer of 1947 
he broke the records in New 
Yorks Hotel Pennsylvanias Cafe 
Rouge. At present he is playing at 
the Stevens Hotel in Chicago.

Editorial
On Unsuitable Men
We paid a visit to Student Council last 
Wednesday on a business of some passing un
pleasantness. It was the first time we have seen 
Council in real action and what we saw we 
didnt like.
For those members of Council who are not 
participating in any of the several continuous
ly active committees, their job in the student 
government consists of attending one meet
ing a week for approximately one hour.
This service, performed for one year, is 
rewarded by a gold-jeweled key. The editor 
of a major publication or the director of Spring 
Carnival or Scotch and Soda (performing a 
job requiring approximately a standard work 
week) receives the same honor.
One might, of course, be led to presume 
that during this hour the members of Council 
sit at rigid attention, absorbing every word 
spoken as they hold themselves alert to pre
vent any abuse of the rights of their dues-paying constituents.
We did note that several of the leading 
Councilmen were indeed awake, squirming un
easily in their seats, calmly calculating the 
flight path of the next brick, or just plain 
perspiring.
But the biggest section of Council had only 
one object in minddinner.
Although disagreeing intensely with much 
that transpired during that session, disputing 
the fundamental reasoning behind it, we do 
respect those members of Council who used 
their thinking apparatus at least in part, and 
who said what was on their minds.
We are unhappy about*the presence on 
Council of those members who sat out that, and 
according to the best of sources, all previous 
meetings. We are unhappy because we are 
watching, in miniature, the worst weakness in 
democracy as developed to datethe inability 
of its electoral mechanisms to insure the pres
ence in office both high and low of fully compe
tent men. And we dont have a single work
able answer which would successfully apply 
even within the hospitable door of the Car
negie Union.
l. e.Service Infiltration 
Into Government Hit
By Gerald C. Meyers
Must we have military rule?
During the past eighteen months the brass hats 
and striped pants of the Army and the Navy have 
infiltrated many branches of the government which 
formerly had been exclusive civilian domain. This 
mounting influence of the military mind in Ameri
can life is an ill omen. What does it mean? Where 
' will it lead us?
Nowhere in the history of our country is there 
a parallel from which we may attempt a forecast. 
However, it would be well to take cognizance of 
the fact that military men are trained to command 
not to obey and, for democratic government, 
they must obey. A violation of the principle of 
self-government must not be tolerated lest we 
wake up someday and find ourselves slaves.
Civil liberties are the priceless heritage of all 
Americans and any deviation from, or abridgement 
of, these rights is justified only during time of war. 
Even then the road back must be clearly defined. 
I shudder to compare our present state of affairs 
with that of Germany in the early thirties or of 
modern-day Argentina.
Apparently, our major political parties are not 
alarmed over the matter. Witness their eagerness 
to run Eisenhower, Marshall or (the recently humil
iated) Mac Arthur for the White House position. 
Georges Clemenceau, the Old Tiger of France, 
once quipped, War is far too important to be left 
to the generals. Permit me to add peace to that 
category.
But let us suppose for the present that the 
presidential issue is inconsequential and take a brief 
glance at another miltaristic infiltration into our 
peoples government. It is a fact that every 
important action taken by the State department 
since the wars end has gone awry because of our 
diplomatic incompetence and lack of foresight.
We have blundered unforgivably in Palestine, 
Germany, and China. Our influence in Italy will be 
tested within the week.
The crucial Italian election has necessitated our 
diplomats coming up with a few hat tricks. We 
dont know yet if these will be successful. On the 
Trieste issue, Russia cant possibly win a point, for 
even if the city is returned to the mother country 
the Western Powers will gain credit for making 
the suggestion. This is statesmanship.
The type of action taken on Triestean exam
ple of honest, effective dealing that will not only 
maintain a respectable code of international ethics 
but will also foster good willis certainly rare 
today.
It is far too easy for a diplomat to throw up 
his hands in despair, and in the same gesture, bring 
death to millions of innocent, bewildered citizens.
The United States, lacking able statesmen, now 
faces its most serious international crisis since 1939. 
In this capacity we have inept and ego-involved 
generals who would otherwise fill the ranks of the 
unemployed. Such charity is treason.
The results of this deplorable condition are 
shamefully clear. Today we are headed toward 
wartomorrow, obliteration.
Letter To The Editor
Reply To 4On Stage
I find the article ON STAGE by Dick Drisko 
and Edward Von Halle in the April 6 issue of the 
Tartan grossly unprofessional and distasteful. This 
crass commentary misinformed its readers, failed 
to accomplish its supposed aim, and showed a lack 
of critical aptitude on the part of the authors.
In the first place, when one seeks an intelligent 
criticism of a play, one should not be faced with 
diatribes on past productions which were pre
viously reviewed. And in answer to the critics 
statement of the siege of awkward and atavistic 
experiments the Carnegie Tech audiences suffered 
through last semester, may it please Messrs. Dris
ko and Von Halle that the plays presented by the 
department of drama are primarily intended to 
train the actors in diverse types of roles and styles 
of acting, and only secondarily to entertain the 
various and sundry elements encountered by the 
actors.
Secondly, if the reader is presented with a dis
proportionate criticism of a single actor, let it at 
least be constructive and not an infantile display 
of inane wit and obtuse similies.
Finally, there is no doubt that the critics were 
denied a second set of tickets due to the pressing 
demands made by the overwhelming number of 
the more learned subscribers who had not been 
given the opportunity of seeing the production. 
This is no doubt fortunate in as much as the second 
cast was thereby spared the exposure to the same puerll* drivel suffered by the first.

S nS Presents iThe Ladys at Work9
Musical Review 
Opening May 11
TUESDAY, APRIL 13, 1948______________________________THE CARNEGIE TARTAN 3
27 Songs, New Look, Women 
Features of Annual Show
The Ladys at Work, Scotch and Soda clubs
1948 musical production, completely written and 
produced by undergraduates, is in full preparation 
for opening night May 11 when 27 songssome bal
lads, some novelty, some blueswill carry with 
humor and just a pinch of sopristication a novel 
theme of working women.
Depicted in The Ladys at Wwk are women
in the city and women on the farm  at all work. The first act finds city
women working as clerks, steno
graphers, usherettes, manicurists, 
and even scrub women, while the 
second act takes the same women 
and puts them on the farm as 
milkmaids, cooks, and farmerettes.
| Throughout the revue the women, 
both rural and urban, are working 
on the men.
Scotch and Soda first made its 
presence felt in the world of col
lege shows in 1938. That year it 
was a revue called No Spring 
which had two performances in 
the Carnegie Music hall with the 
cast and crews coming from a 
nucleus of pioneering drama de
partment students.
The next year began a series 
of shows with titles referring to 
the alcoholic implications of the 
clubs name. In 1939 it was Take 
It Straight, in 1940 One on the 
House, in 1941 Heres To You, 
and then after a five year break 
the Scotch and Soda club was re
activated last year with Rock n 
Riot.
The club reached its first peak 
of success in 1941 when Variety 
the theatrical newspaper noted 
the show as something outstand
ing in collegiate musicals and 
Harold V. Cohen gave a rave re
view in the Post-Gazette.
The 115 costumes by A1 Leh
man, junior drama student, give 
The Ladys at Work a fashion 
angle that is unique. Already 
fashion editors and experts in the 
Pittsburgh area have taken notice 
of Lehmans designs for The 
Ladys at Work. The entire show 
is done in the New Lookin the 
city it is a theatrical ultra-New 
Look and on the farm Lehman 
has gone all out to create new 
styles for the farmerette. When 
the lady goes to work on the farm 
she will be wearing the New Look.
The show consists of two acts 
and 28 scenes featuring 27 songs, 
written by George Wood and ar
ranged by the staff of musical di
rector Dick Hoch.
Individual rehearsals of each 
member of the cast of 80 with 
author Wood have been going on 
afternoon and evening since the 
beginning of the semester in prep
aration for full production this 
week under the direction of Mr. 
Lawrence Carra of the drama de
partment faculty.
The cast as a whole has already 
had three complete run-throughs 
of the show which have left every
one connected with it convinced 
that Scotch and Soda has a revue 
of Broadway calibre.
The fitting climax to the months 
of work which the scores of stu
dents connected with the produc
tion have devoted to it will come 
on the evenings of May 11, 12, and 13, and the afternoon of May 13 
when The Ladys at Work will 
finally go before the footlights.
First Musical 
Was Presented 
Ten Years Ago
The Ladys at Work is the 
product of the 200 members of 
Scotch and Soda club, which un
der the leadership of David Crantz 
brings together drama students, 
artists, musicians, costume design
ers, electrical engineers, and stu
dents from all other departments 
in the school with the talent, ex
perience, and desire to put on a 
commercial musical revue.
David Crantz, senior drama stu
dent, heads Scotch and Soda as 
chairman of the executive board, 
which as the organizing and rul
ing body of the club selects an 
original show each year, guides 
the production through to the fin
al performances, and finally elects 
the board for the following year.
This years board consists of 
George Sherman, business manag
er; James McGiffin, technical di
rector; Richard Hock, musical di
rector; and Anthony Arrott, pub
licity. Danny Franks, Jack Drier, 
and Bert Pollock act in advisory 
?car capacities and Barbara Ebaugh is 
UN0VJT W secretary.

4THE OARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 13, 1948
One of the Boys
Reacting to the confinement of 
dormitory life and the pressure 
of school routine, Jack Guyol 
periodically indulges in a redec
oration of his room in Scobel hall.
The latest in delicate perspec
tive is a blue room, set off by one 
solid wall of passionate pur
ple!
This eccentric sense of the 
esthetic is hidden, normally, be
hind a plaintive deadpanwhen 
there is no time to go to the 
Greeks for a beer or if his own 
well-stocked room suddenly be
comes dry. In more fluid times his 
features register, meter-like, the 
amount of consumption by accent
uating the sad face until he has 
the appearance of a little lost pup
py.
At the semi-saturated stage, 
Jack adds a one-note baritone 
to the chorus of his favorite Irish 
ballads. A bit later, he becomes 
philosophical and is ready for an
other all night bull session.
Jack is a study in slow motion; 
the picture of complacency. But 
for all this appearance of serenity, 
he has done well with his spare 
time, having ridden the activi
ties circuit for the presidency of 
Dormitory council, with its ac
companying ex - officio member
ship in the Student Conference 
committee, and for some good 
bursts of infighting in the realm 
of campus politics.
In his Making the Rounds for 
the Scottie, Jack has profoundly 
developed such topics as the op
eration of the numbers racket and 
a study of the drug store pinball 
machine. Called a humorist and 
a joker, he revels in banter and 
such ideas as the snow bank road 
blocks on Margaret Morrison 
street.

dinner at the Westinghouse plant 
the section members went to the 
Stephen Foster auditorium to hear 
speakers from Pitt and CIT vie 
for the prizes.
Originally Grace, Brenton, and 
Vincent Prus were chosen to rep
resent the CIT student branch of 
the AIEE at the Pittsburgh section 
meeting. Prus finished fourth in 
the contest and received a citation 
because his speech, scheduled for 
ten minutes, lasted ten minuates 
and one second. Grace received 
$50 and Brenton, $25.
Grace is to represent the CIT 
branch of District 2 at tlje Dis
trict meeting in Washington, D.C., 
where approximately twelve 
speakers will try for the prize of 
$100 and a free trip to Mexico 
City where the national meeting 
of the AIEE will be held this sum

Jack Guyol* * *
Sharp-witted and sarcastic to 
the point of frequently giving the 
impression of bitterness, Jack 
seldom comes out second in a good 
argument. His points are 
strengthened as a result of his 
habit of critical reading (much of 
it from his bible, the New York 
Times) and he backs them with a 
wealth of factual knowledge.
But he does not confine himself 
to the pursuit of unembellished 
facts, having active tastes in class
ical literature, art, and music. 
His liking for the comic strip 
character Barnaby is even more 
intense, and he relishes the daily 
laugh which he gets from the lit
tle fellow as much as his drawer
ful of well-smoked pipes.
A senior chemistry student, Jack 
is aiming at consumer technical 
service or chemical sales for a 
career which will begin this 
Spring.

Sports Coverage To Increase; 
Intramural Officiating Blasted
by William SchnitgenDuring the past few weeks this 
department has received several 
letters offering criticism, both 
constructive and otherwise, of the 
sports section of the Tartan. These 
comments are appreciated and the 
suggestions will be acted upon ac
cording to their individual merits.
Of primary importance at this 
time is the substance of the blast 
coming from the Dragging 49ers, 
an independent entry in the intra
mural basketball league.
The first criticism reprimands 
us for not covering all intramrual 
games, particularly those involv
ing teams low in league standings. 
Our poor excuse is a lack of re
porters and of space, which nec
essitate our covering only events 
of paramount importance. How
ever, an attempt will be made to 
have reporters cover all events in 
the future.
The remainder of the blast 
takes a healthy cut against in
tramural officiating. On this point 
I am in entire agreement with 
the Dragons, particularly after the 
events of the past week.
The Dragons maintain that 
after their poor showing in initial 
contest, the referees seemed to 
sense that the ensuing games 
would have little significance in
league standings and officiate ac
cordingly.
Although the Dragons were def
initely outclassed they were the 
recipients of a raw deal. Bill Poir
ier, one of the Dragon aces, re
ports the case of one official read
ing the Tartan during the progress 
of a game.
Another undesirable situation 
popped up last week. Soccer of
ficials assigned to games were 
picked arbitrarily with the result 
that men worked games in the 
same league as their fraternity 
team.
Any man accepting the job un
der these conditions places himself 
in a difficult position. Any close 
decision leads one team or the 
other to claim foul play, and the 
spectators at these events are sure 
to let the official know of their 
disapproval.
If the intramural office is to 
continue to show improvement in 
its work, some effort must be made 
to secure improved officiating. The 
intramural director and the intra
mural board must take it upon 
themselves to make spot checks 
on games, instruct offcials of their 
duties, and take greater care in as
signing the referees and um
pires.
Rifle Entries
Entries for the intramural 
rifle competition must be in the 
intramural office by April 14. 
Scabbard and Blade, the ROTC 
honorary, will supervise this 
activity. Each organization may 
enter any number of fourrman 
teams. A slight fee for ammu
nition will be charged. Points 
earned in shooting will not 
count toward the intramural 
all-points trophy.

Buddy Yorkin of Tau Delta, Phi,

In intramural foul shooting 
competition, the Kappa Sigma en
try paced the field of those who 
qualified for the final round with 
a commanding 198 total. Phi Kap
pa, Emanon, Tau Delta Phi and 
Theta Xi also entered with closely 
bunched scores of 187, 186, 185, 
and 148, respectively. These teams 
will shoot again to decide the
school championship.
Each team entered five men 
who tried 50 shots apiece with 
the number of tossed sunk being 
the score for the team. Individual 
scores were also kept with the 
top men qualifying for the in
dividual championship finals.
Tennis, Golf 
Teams Open 
New Season
Preparing for their opening 
match with Duquesne on April 27, 
Coach Frank Moses tennis players 
began intra-squad competition last 
Friday in an attempt to reduce the 
squad.
Leading the net men will be 
captain Jim Taylor, who has kept 
his timing during the off-season, 
advancing to the semi-finals in 
both intramural table tennis and 
handball competition.
The golf squad will also open 
its season against Duquesne, tee 
ing off against the Dukes on April 
27.
4 Entering spring competition in 
intramural sports for the AllPoints trophy, eighteen point-scor
ing teams face almost complete 
Theta Xi dominance of the honors, 
with the Emanon squad standing 
only a slight mathematical chance 
of edging out the present leaders.
Scoring for the trophy is com
puted on the following basis:
Points 1Number of points for 
entering a team and playing 
through the schedule.
Points 2Number of points for 
each game won.
Points 3Number of points for 
league championship. Half this 
number will be given to runnersup. Points 3 are eliminated when 
there is only one league.
Points 4Number of points for 
school championship. Half this 
number will be given to runnersup.

Swim Party, Dance
May 1st is just about the time 
to get your second wind for the remaining weeks of this semester 
and there is no better way to get 
in shape than to attend the com
bination swimming party-movie 
dance that particular Saturday 
evening. These activities are go
ing to be combined in the gymnasium building when student coun
cil sponsors its last scheduled so
cial event for the year.
The swimming pool will be 
open at 8:00 and dancing in Thistle 
Hall from 9:00 until 1:00. Swim
ming will end at 10:00 so there 
will be ample time for dancing 
during the remainder of the eve
ning. The swimming is optional 
as is the dancing, but an evening 
of both offers combined relaxa
tion and enjoyment for all.
The movie-dance is a new in
novation to councils activities. By 
means of the sound film the best 
bands of the land bring their 
music and actions to the dance. 
It is not only a pleasure to dance
under the subdued lights to the 
most pleasing music available, but 
it is also a novelty to watch the 
orchestras in their motions.
In order to curb expenses, a 
donation of $.50, which will be 
collected at the door, is asked of 
all those attending.

Council
[Continued from page I] 
contingency which had arisen 
since the last Council meeting. Members of the Tartan editorial 
staff were examined at length by 
Council as a result of the special 
report given by Reed. Reeds appointment as head of the special 
committee was approved by Coun
cil previously. The committee was 
formed to study some of the ac
tions which occurred at the Tar
tan executive board meeting of 
April 6, 1948. Reed appointed as 
members of the committee Jack 
Ewart, J. K. OHare, Marvin Gustavson, Lee Wiley, and Ted Ul
rich. Resulting from the commit
tee report were resolutions to the 
effect that all staff changes which 
came after April 1, 1948 ace to 
be made by this committee with 
the approval of Student Council, 
and that all resignations from the 
staff be sent directly to this com
mittee for approval or disapproval 
with the subsequent approval of 
Student Council. (This is an 
amended form of the original pro
posal.)
Provisions for approval of dis
approval of committee actions by 
Student Council as a whole were
not included at first. These were 
suggested by Jack Ewart and ap
proved by Council. The Student 
Council regulations are to stay in 
effect until a new constitution is 
approved by Council. The com
mittee was given the authority to 
write a new constitution for the 
Tartan with the results of their 
work being presented to Student 
Council for its approval by April 
21, 1948. Within one week after 
Councils approval of the new 
constitution there will be an elec
tion of the 1948-49 Tartan staff as 
provided for in the new constitu
tion. After a lengthy debate and 
discussion among the members of 
Council and several members of 
the Tartan executive board who 
attended the meeting, all amend
ments as well as Reeds initial mo
tion to accept the resolutions of 
the special committee were ac
cepted.
As a result of Scimitars objec
tions, decision on the new activi
ties points system was tabled for 
one week so that Scimitar could 
have an opportunity to consider 
the proposed changes.
Andrew Sterrett, chairman of 
the Council mens points commit
tee, had previously proposed a 
motion to accept the new arrange
ment. He stated that the list was 
put in the Deans office, but I 
have received no sugestin/
Sterrett recommended that in
tercollegiate wrestling and Stu
dent Council be given five points 
each. Also, a restriction of 30 
points maximum on the group 
containing general activities is to 
be removed.
Jack Seward, chairman of 
Council elections committee, an
nounced that T. J. Hall would 
serve as his assistant for the re
mainder of the semester. His re
port included an announcement 
that nominations for the spring

bers are now officially open. Date 
of closing of nominations will be 
set at next weeks Council meet
ing. APO will conduct this elec
tion under more specific orders 
through the supervision of the
