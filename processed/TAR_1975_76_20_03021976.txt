SG Petitions Due Today Despite Publicity
by Charles Mitck
An almost complete failure to publi
dta the availability of positions of Presi
ranS of Student Government and openings 
en Student Senate marks todays official 
) deadline for petitions for Student Govern
canS candidates. As of this writing no 
uSSaciS has been made by senate to inform 
Sya campus community that petitions must 
Ea filed by March 2 for the elections which 
Student Senates by-laws require to be in 
Sya first two weeks of March.
Someone completely failed in his re
sponsibility, Doug Konopka, President of 
Student Government commented. Both 
Konopka and Student Senate Chairperson, 
Don Simon, were quite disturbed over the 
lack of publicity.
The Senate Rules committee is respon 
sible for running elections including the 
necessary publicity. According to Rules 
Chairperson Jerry Digennaro, an unnamed 
member of his committee was designated 
to handle the job but failed to publicize 
the elections. Digennaro agreed with crit
icism that the lack of publicity was unfair.
He stated that he hopes to have posters put 
up announcing the petitions before the 
^adline. He also added that he intends to
be very liberal in interpretting deadlines 
specified in the by-laws.
Digennaro commented that he felt the 
situation was not serious. He pointed out 
that the number of people filing petitions 
this year did not appear to be any less than 
elections which were highly publicized. He 
estimated that there would be about 20 to 
25 petitions filed for senate seats and 
about two to four petitions filed for Stu
dent Government President.
To file petitions candidates for pres
ident must obtain 100 student signatures 
and those filing for senate seats must ob
tain 25 signatures from students in their 
college

Security Expects 
Crime Wave
by Joan Konkle
As the days begin to grow longer and 
the temperature climbs higher during the 
last few months of school, the number of 
burglaries and thefts that occur on campus 
always increases. According to Security, 
this rise in crime occurs because in the 
spring students tend to become careless.
The importance of taking basic precau
tions is shown by the fact that recently se
veral unlocked lockers in the gym were 
ransacked, Had they been locked, there is 
very little chance that the thief would

Adequate Housing Predicted for '76
by Charles Mitch
Official room reservation statistics from 
the housing office suggest that the universi
tys housing capacity will be adequate to 
handle next falls demand for on-campus 
housing. The housing office predicted well 
what the demand would be, projecting a 
need to house 2094 while the actual figure 
after room draw is 2112.
SDC Officers Picked
by Debbie Rosenkrantz
As of last Sunday, the newly elected 
SDC officers took office. Elected were 
Cheryl Lawson, President, Amy Boyle, 
Vice-president from the Morewood area, 
Kim Davis, treasurer, and Eloise Pugar, 
secretary. The post of Vice President from 
the hill dorms remains unfilled.
Cheryl wants to improve efficiency 
and increase student awareness of SDC by 
directing the committees toward specific 
goals. For example, she wants to work 
on setting up services on campus that one 
would generally have to go off for, such as
restaurants. Cheryl would like to see more 
work done in areas other than housing and 
food service, such as fire and safety, social 
and buggy. Other plans include putting 
SDC members undersemi-pressure for 
the rest of this year. When asked why she 
would only apply semi-pressure, Cheryl 
replied, Its not fair to expect people to 
do a years work in five weeks. Everyone 
would quit. Cheryl hopes to finish pro
jects that have been started this year and 
do a few other things in addition before 
the summer break.
Im sitting comfortably because well 
be able to handle everyone, Chuck 
Williams, Dean of Residence Life, com
mented about the recently released figures.
The current statistics do however show 
a projected shortage of 55 spaces. But 
Dean Williams expects  some of the 
students who have drawn to not show up 
in the fall for various reasons (e.g. supension, dropouts, transfers).
The number of residents returning to 
live in the dorms has dropped dramatically 
to 49% from last years 66%, and is still well 
below the 55% average of the last several 
years. If the retention rate had not been so 
much lower, on-campus housing capacity 
would not not have been adequate. Steve 
Zalewski, Director of Campus Services, 
stated that he felt the lower retention rate 
was due to a misunderstanding over the 
increase in housing rates. While students 
felt the increases were unreasonable, 
Zalewski points out that he believes the 
average price increase of 8% was nominal 
considering recent rates of inflation.
Zalewski also commented that he 
would expect expect up to 100 kids after
spring break to ask for housing because of 
the tight apartment market. He added 
student apartments just arent available.
For the future, Zalewski predicts well 
have close to a 100% occupancy rate for 
the next four to five years. In order to 
prepare for the this, Zaleski is meeting 
with Williams and Richard Van Horn, Vice 
President for Business affairs, to prepare 
contingency plans. He is still looking into 
leasing apartment buildings for next fall in 
case they are needed.
One key undetermined variable is the 
number of freshmen to be housed .Current
ly the university is expecting to house 840 
freshmen and transfers based on an incom
ing class of 1050. Howver last year an in
coming class of 1050 was also anticipated 
but the actual size was almost 1200, which 
caused housing problems last semester.
When asked about this, Williams told the 
TARTAN, youve all heard Cyert and 
Elliott say 840 freshmen ...They promised 
840 come hell or high water. He added 
Ive a perfect out, the housing policy 
promised us we would have to house 
only that many.
Seniors to Set Up 5 Year Gift Fund

by Thomas Kendig
This year a committee of about 5 se
niors, with the help of the development 
office, are trying to start a special annual 
senior class fund that will be used as a gift 
to the university given in the name of that 
class. The fund will be built upon yearly 
contributions of the class of 76 until the 
fund matures after five years. At this time 
the class will decide how the money is to 
be spent.
To start the program which other uni
versities and colleges already have, the 
committee has decided on an approach to 
present their ideas to the students. The 
program will be initiated by a mailing of 
declaration cards to all seniors during the 
first week of March asking the seniors for 
an indication of how much they would be 
willing to pledge the fund. The develop
ment office will handle the collection of 
the funds over the 5 year period until the 
maturation of the fund. Near the end of 
the period a ballot will be mailed to the 
people who have been contributing to the 
fund. The ballot will have a list of pro
posed alternatives for the use of the fund, 
the winning project to be completed by the
committee and the development office 
under the name of the class of 76.
What gift choices are to be considered 
will depend on the amount of participation 
within the senior class. With a 25% res
ponse, the committee hopes to raise bet
ween ten and twelve thousand dollars.
There are two basic approaches for the use 
of the money. A fund could be set up and 
the gift would be the annual return on the 
money or the money could all be spent at 
one time. Suggestions that have been pro
posed so far have included: a scholarship

Housing Economics
Even the proponents of a free market system admit that 
it will only operate effectively if the market is competitive 
and all the participants are knowledgeable. Given these two 
constraints, it is dear that the recently released policy and 
rate structure for CMUs on-campus housing is not operating 
within such a free market structure.
Obviously the on-campus market is not competitive. For 
one thing there is only one supplier and the supply is ex
tremely limited. Given the location of possible off-campus 
dwellings, it is almost impossible to obtain a residence within 
five minutes walking distance of the campus unless you rent 
it from the University. The result is a monopolistic price stucture within which, as an introductory economics text would 
verify, the price is higher; the supply is more limited; and, the 
operation is more inefficient than under a competitive sys
tem.
A simple price per dwelling comparison between oncampus and off-campus proves the first tenet of the monopo
listic model. The cost for three people living in an on-campus 
efficiency apartment would be $3300 while the cost for three 
people living in a three-bedroom off-campus apartment, 
equipped with all the modern conveniences and including 
utilities, would total about $2900. This is comparing the 
eight month lease with the university with a twelve month 
lease required by most private landlords since the university 
must rent at a rate that covers its costs for the whole year 
while occupancies are limited during the four summer 
months. If the off-campus resident was able to sub-lease 
his her apartment during the summer, the cost would be 
reduced to approximately $2000; 67% less than it costs for 
the inferior on-campus accommodation. Students are being 
asked to pay in excess of $1300 for the convenience of living 
on campus; a very expensive convenience, indeed!
Despite this expense, the University is assuming that the 
demand for on<ampus housing is sufficiently greater than in 
the past to warrant increased occupancy levels. Thus,at least 
in the short run, it is also true that, as is predicted by the 
monopolistic model, the supply of on<ampus housing is less 
than it would be under a competitive system.
The point of proving the present housing policy monopo
listic is not that the on-campus market should be open to in
dependent landlords so as to approach a more competitive 
price system, but rather that the present system must, given 
that it fits this uncompetitive model, be operating inefficient
ly. The price discrepancy between an on and off-campus 
residence varies by such a large degree that it should be 
obvious that CMU is doing something wrong.
CMU Administrators stated that it was necessary for 
housing rates to increase because the University had to pay 
back government construction loans and make future capital 
improvements to the boiler system and windows in Morewood Gardens. Although / do not doubt that these costs 
are real, it is also true that these are costs that all landlords 
must deal with, usually with financial institutions who are 
less compromising and understanding than the federal govern
ment. All businesses make annual depreciation deductions 
from their income to cover the cost of capital improvements 
and repairs. Why is it that CMUs costs are so out of line with 
the rest of the industry? The same arguments apply to the 
Universitys contention that the higher rates are necessary to 
combat increased utility charges
Based on this analysis, it seems dear that although CMU 
is run by some of the worlds most esteemed economists, it 
failed to account for the simplest economic theory when it 
established its exhorbitant price schedule. The University has 
an obligation to explain to both the students and the trustees 
the reasons for these extreme price discrepancies. Are the stu
dents being ripped off or is CMU one of the worlds worst 
landlords?

I would like to make a few 
corrections to an article printed 
in the TARTAN on February 
17,1976.
First of all, the last mention
ed committee to which I may 
appoint chairmen should have 
been Greek Sing and Swing, 
NOT Greek Sing and Living.
Secondly, any appointments I 
make to a court system are to 
the UFO Court. I do not know 
that a student court, as such, 
exists at this point in time. 
Appointments to the Court for 
this year were made on February 
9, and only the position of sec
retary is currently open.
Thirdly, it is the UFO consti
tution which needs a review, not 
necessarily the schools. Ive 
never seen a school constitution, 
and I only wish to make sure 
there are no contradictions be
tween the UFO document and 
existing University policies.
Your reporter was specifically 
told it is not clear how many
fraternities and/or sororities will 
petition for recognition if Uni
versity limits should be lifted. At 
present, the school policy per
mits twelve social fraternities 
(which we have) and seven social 
sororities. To the best of my 
knowledge, not all six groups 
currently existing on campus 
have petitioned the Unified Fra
ternal Organization.
Any questions regarding UFO 
can be directed to me or a mem
ber of the Executive Committee 
through the UFO mailbox at the 
Skibo Information desk, or by 
personally contacting one of us.

THE TARTAN-March 3, 1976-Page 3news comment
\ EU FROR THE TO?
The latest episode probably 
began during the Vietnam War 
and then was speeded up by the 
Watergate scandal. But one can
not deny the basic truth reflect
ed in the public opinion polls 
which have been reporting the 
notable and even remarkable de
crease in the confidence which 
citizens have in government. 
Perhaps one can place this grow
ing lack of confidence in per
spective by noting that we are 
observing the bicentennial. After 
all, the birth of our nation can 
be properly summarized as a re
volt against existing authority. 
Indeed, our Bill of Rights is 
largely an expression of the be
lief that unless its powers are 
explicitly checked, governmen
tal authority will, sooner or la
ter, be subject to abuse and the 
rights of citizens will be violated 
by that authority.
For the reasons cited above 
as well as others - perhaps es
pecially the fact that scholars 
of government and public pol
icy found it so easy to cite 
examples of miss-directed pro
grams, gross inefficiency and 
abuse, and just plain waste - 
several of us who were members 
of the GSIA faculty during the 
1960s started to feel that our 
basic mission might be misdi
rected. Indeed, being profession
al economists who specialized in 
studying the working of a mar
ket economy, we observed that 
although there are abuses such as 
are witnessed by the existence 
of such phenomenon as air and 
water pollution, for the greater 
part our private enterprise sys
tem has built into it such checks 
and balances that it is not likely 
to stray far from basically 
appropriate directions. However, 
when one considers the interac
tion of that system with govern
mental authority and policy, in
cluding the regulation of that 
system, we tended to have far 
less confidence in the future of 
our society. In summary, we felt 
that the greatest challenge and 
need in the forseeable future 
was the creation of a new type 
of talented professional who 
would be devoted to the direc
tion of governmental authority 
and policy at both the national 
and local levels. This was proba
bly the most noble of the inspir
ations of those of us who were 
associated with the creation of 
the School of Urban and Public 
Affairs. This inspiration is still 
with us.
Although a career in the pub
lic service may be less reward
ing financially than, say, a ca
reer in business, we believe that 
the challenge and the power to 
influence the future of our so
ciety is notably greater in such 
a career. When SUPA was estab
lished in 1968, we had a strong 
belief that the convictions ex
pressed above were accurate. 
However, we did not know then 
whether they were widely shared 
or would be appreciated either 
by potential students or by po
tential employers. Accordingly,
we began with a program which 
was relatively small and highly 
experimental at both the 
Masters and Ph.D. levels. We 
now believe that our initial years 
have been highly successful and 
we are now in the process of 
moving into a second stage of 
our existence. Last year we sig= 
nificantly expanded our Masters 
Program by almost doubling the 
number of students which were 
admitted. This year we hope to 
expand the program even more. 
We plan to hold our Ph.D. Pro
gram to its present size at least 
for the immediate future. The 
difference in our plans for these 
two programs does not mean 
that we hold one to be more or 
less important than the other in 
any fundamental sense, but it 
does reflect our views of the 
nature of the market for our 
graduates over the next few 
years.
It is August 20, 1976. You 
have resigned yourself to living 
in a standard triple that proba
bly has housed only two people 
for as long as the dorm has been 
standing. The mail arrives.
Dear Resident:
Due to a miscalculation in the 
number of students who need 
housing for this year, we could 
not find the third person to 
fill your triple. Because you have 
been blessed with this wonderful 
opportunity by Carnegie-Mellon 
University, we are sure you will 
be oveijoyed to hear that we will 
be removing the third bed from 
your room. Of course the room 
will be reclassified as a prime 
double with a corresponding 
price increase of $150.
Thank you,
Even as the School was being 
created some eight years ago, we 
believed that there would be a 
strong desire on the part of our 
graduates to go into local 
government and that a portion 
would also find their way into 
the private sector, especially that 
part which deals with the gov
ernment. At the time, however, I 
do not think that we would have 
believed the following percent
age breakdown of placements. 
The percentages refer to the 
graduating class of 1975: Feder
al government, 25%; local 
government, 25%; state govern
ment, 8%; private sector, 33%; 
and miscellaneous, 8%. True to 
our earlier prediction, almost 
all of those graduates who went 
into the private sector went into 
that part of it whose main busi
ness is working upon public 
problems. In this area, of course, 
rates of pay compare quite favOR...
It is September 8, 1976. You 
have resigned yourself to live in 
a standard triple because the ad
ministration has promised to 
save only 840 spaces for entering 
freshmen. You know that at 
least you will have a lounge to 
go to if your roomies bug you 
too much. When you get to floor 
4B in Morewood, you notice 
that the lounge seems to have 
been refurnished. There are now 
six freshmen girls living in your 
lounge. A note in the hall reads: 
Dear Residents of 4B:
I am terribly sorry to inform 
you that your lounge will once 
again be used by new students. 
Billy over in Admissions seems 
TO HAVE MADE A SLIGHT
orably witn otncr areas ot busi
ness and it is my understanding 
that a SUPA M.S. graduate ob
tained the highest starting salary 
of any of the M.S. graduates on 
our campus last year. Indeed, in 
recognition of the fact that some 
graduates might want to plan for 
a career which moves back and 
forth between the public and 
private sectors, SUPA and GSIA 
established a still small but sig
nificant joint M.S. program 
about two years ago.
Perhaps the best way to gain 
a perspective upon CMUs new
est professional school is to 
quote the first paragraph of our 
catologue:
The School of Urban and 
Public Affairs was established 
by a grant to Carnegie-Mellon 
University from Mr. and Mrs. 
Richard K. Mellon in 1968. 
The School was created to 
answer a growing need for 
educating men and women in 
the management skills and 
research techniques essential 
to dealing with the increas
ingly complex problems of 
urban planning, transporta
tion, environmental quality, 
health care, energy econom
ics, administration of justice, 
and inter-governmental rela
tions. Of fundamental impor
tance in approaching these 
problems is the ability to 
understand them as compon
ents of one comprehensive, 
dynamically varying system.
We believe that the School 
has been making great progress 
in achieving the goals establish
ed for it throught the vision of 
Mr. and Mrs. Mellon. But, as we 
indicated in our opening re
marks, the challenges are still 
there. Indeed, one of the most 
important lessons that we learn 
ed since the sixties is that our 
public problems are often much 
more difficult and complex than 
had commonly been realized. 
Hence, the challenge may be 
greater than we originally 
thought, and the need for men 
and women who are trained to 
be practitioners and researchers
MISCALCULATION. For the 
second year in a row, we have 
the largest entering class. I am 
sure that everyone will try to 
make the new students feel wel
come.
Thank you, 
Dean Chuckles
Due to lack of agreement by 
the administration on what 
weight the Housing Policy and 
Procedures document carries, 
either of the above situations 
could occur next semester. Vice 
President Richard Van Horn 
looks upon the policy as a good 
faith gesture. While Dean 
Charles V. Williams said I dont 
see how they (the occupancy 
levels) could be higher. later he

may be correspondingly more 
fundamental. We hope to rise 
to these more complex chal
lenges in the second stage of our 
existance. In addition to trying 
to increase the size of our classes 
(And let me ribte here, by the 
way, that we are now in the 
process of recruiting a class for 
next year and applications for 
admission and financial aid can 
be obtained from Ms. Gwendo
lyn Langford in SUPAs Ad
ministrative Offices on the first 
floor of Margaret Morrison.), 
we are this semester instituting 
a review of our basic M.S. 
curriculum in the hope that, 
with the larger class, we shall be 
able to afford some increased 
flexibility in its design. We aim 
not only to improve our basic 
educational program, but at the 
same time broaden our concep
tion of the kinds of educational 
backgrounds which might be 
suitable for entering into the 
program. In making this re
view, we hope to expand our 
interaction with all of the other 
schools on our campus. Our 
strategy has never been one of 
self-sufficiency, and I believe 
that the appropriate response 
to the educational challenges of 
tomorrow will be to find ways 
to utilize all of the resources 
of our university in a more 
creative manner.
Finally, let me close with a 
somewhat personal note. Last 
year, while serving on sab
batical at The Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral 
Sciences, I determined to look 
around in a more or less ob
jective fashion to assess my own 
opportunities as well as those 
afforded by the insititutions 
with which I might become 
affiliated. One result of that 
assessment stands out above 
all other-Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity, even with its multitude 
of problems and perhaps des
pite them, does more with the 
resources which it commands 
than any other institution which 
I visited or which I am familiar.
I found this result, as well as 
the challenge presented to me by 
the deanship for SUPA, to be 
an overwhelming attraction. It 
probably also is a formula for 
new successes in increasing our 
excellence. We have to be sure 
that we are able to exploit 
our advantages and our oppor
tunities to work together across 
an organizational structure 
which appears strange to out
siders but which, most of the 
time, is a tribute to the willing
ness of our faculty and its lead
ership to take advantage of our 
comparative opportunities. If we 
are not able to continue to be 
able to do more with what we 
have than is achieved by other 
universitties, we will suffer in 
the increased competition which 
will characterize tomorrow and 
will not be able to arise to even 
higher heights of greatness and 
excellence.

Currently on campus there are two student organizations involved 
with complaints and recommendations regarding Academic Affairs. One 
is the Student Advisory Committees, and the other is the Academic Af
fairs Committee of Student Senate.
The SACs originate out of each department, and therefore handle 
mainly departmental affairs. At this time there is no reasonably effec
tive coordinating council of the SACs.
Surely there exists on campus academic problems that encompass 
more than one department and acadepiic problems that have to be 
solved on a university level. Clearly, the structure of the SACs is not 
adequate, with respect to coordination.
To provide for this need [of coordination] the Academic Affairs 
Committee has tried to become active, concerning University Academic 
Policy. To facilitate activity and action, the chairperson is a member of 
the Educational Affairs Council of the Faculty Senate, the Faculty 
Senate, and the Trustees Committee on Educational Affairs.
Information that you could obtain, or action you could receive from 
the academic affairs could best be illustrated by what has been done to 
date. Because the tentative dates of Spring Carnival would interfere 
with the final exam period, the committee instituted actions that sub
sequently changed the date of Spring Carnival. Library hours have been 
increased because of student input. A complete listing of SAC represen
tatives has been collected and will be distributed. Recommendations to 
provide a more extensive offering of composition courses, to disconti
nue mandatory self-paced courses, and to improve the quality and 
quantity of library books.
Most assuredly there are more complaints and recommendations re
garding university academic policy. The Academic Affairs Committee 
will be receptive to any input. You can contact the committee by leav
ing a note at the Skibo Information Desk.

Page 4THE TARTAN-March 3, 1976
The TAR TAN will print announcements 
which it receives before the announced 
deadline (Wednesday, 12 noon) and which 
are presented in a clear (typed, double 
spaced preferred) manner. The criteria for 
selecting announcements for publication is 
as follows: 1) The event or announcement 
must be free and open to the whole (or 
majority) of the campus community;
2) The event or announcement must be of 
general interest and not for the benefit of 
a very limited sample of people.
Because of space limitations, the 
TARTAN cannot guarantee placement of 
any announcement but will attemt in 
good faith to include all announcements 
which meet the above criteria.

Frats Fight
by Laurie Trask
As the mixers were ending last Friday 
night, a small streetfight erupted between 
members of SAE and ATO. A witness 
explained that some men from SAE were 
standing outside their front door when a 
few ATO members came out and began ha
rassing them. Not long after the fight be
gan, Campus Security was on the scene.
Chief of Security, Mike Corletti, told 
the Tartan, When you try to settle things 
down, you often find yourself in the 
middle of it. As security officers were 
attempting to stop the fight, one was 
knocked to the ground and received a 
badly bruised shoulder. He, along with two 
students, were treated and released at 
Shady side Hospital.
Corletti has promised a full scale inves
tigation, but admitted, Unless the parti
cipants come forward...Everything is se

continued from pane 1
program, a projection room, landscaping 
around the campus, subscribing to more 
magazines and supplementing the activities 
fee.
The development office is in favor of 
the new project because it gives people 
involved in school a chance to deal with a 
problem they were aware of when here at 
school (from outside the university con
cern). It is also important to get young 
alumni aware of their influence on the 
University. The trustees as well as President 
Cyert have been made aware of the pro
gram and have voiced no objections. Ted 
Nurenburg, a trustee is a very avid fan of 
the project and would like to see such a 
fund started.

Security Expects 
Crime Wave
have taken the time to break the locks. 
Usually if it takes any time or trouble to 
steal it, the thief will not bother with it, 
and will instead go look for something 
easier to take.
To reduce the number o thefts at CMU, 
students should always lock their doors 
whenever they leave their rooms, even for a 
short time. It takes a thief only a few min
utes to take the easily portable items, such 
as typewriters, stereos, and radios , that 
he is looking for. While in class, students 
should be careful not to forget to take 
their jaclets and purses with them.
People with cars should avoid leaving 
any valuables in them. If they must, it 
should be stored in the trunk. According 
to Mike Corletti, if a valuable item cant 
be seen by a thief then its 75% safe. 
For information on methods of prevent
ing theft of out-of-state liscence plates,

MOSCOW NITE LINE
Nite Line (882-0320) is the number in 
the Moscow, Idaho area that a person 
can call if he or she feels like committing 
suicide or for just about any other reason
 from sharing interpersonal problems 
to getting ideas on how to cook aspar
agus. It is a warm voice to talk to. It 
is someone who sincerely cares about 
your problem, and can look at it ob
jectively, said Charlie Brown, Niteline 
director.
Nite Line is open to callers every 
day from 6:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.
Besides helping people with a crises, 
Nite Line has several functions. It is an 
information outlet, a rumor control cen
ter, a Dial-a-Dietician, a nutrition ser
vice.
As an information outlet, it can direct 
a caller to any service one might need 
in the Moscow area. With a back-up 
list of qualified professional help, Nite 
Line can direct callers with a personal 
problem or crisis to the help they need 
immediately.
As a rumor control center, it will 
answer questions about whats going 
on around Moscow. If we dont know 
the answer to the question, says Bob 
Matthews, treasurer of the organization, 
Well check up on it and find the an
swer for you. We have the right con
nections.
A nutrition service provided by Nite 
Line will answer any questions one has 
about food, cooking, or canning.
Were sort of like a Betty Crocker 
Cookbook. said Brown.
The most busy time of the day for 
operators is immediately after sunset. 
People get lonely when it starts to get 
dark outside, says Brown.
Alcohol abuse amounts to about 98 
per cent of the drug related calls handled 
by Nite Line. But, the misuse of perscription drugs is the largest cause of 
drug related deaths in this area.
Around $3,000 must be raised every 
year to finance the entire operation, and 
a large portion of that amount goes to 
Nite Lines phone bill.
Volunteer operators answer calls for 
four hours on one night every other 
week. An attempt is being made to have 
both a man and a woman operating at 
all times. According to Brown, some 
callers would rather talk to an operator 
of a certain sex.
We need level-headed people. It 
is great on-the-job training for psy
chology majors, he said.

MARITIME COLLEGE
Cal Maritime, the only maritime college 
in the west, a publicly funded institu
tion, has one of the highest job-tograduate ratios in the country. Last 
years graduates went to work at in
comes ranging from $15,000 to $18,000 
per year.
Students receive a minimum of six 
months sea training, much of that aboard the academys 491 foot training 
ship. Ports-o-call on past training cruises 
have included Auckland, Sydney, Fiji, 
Honolulu, Cristobal, Balboa, Gala
pagos, Acapulco, and Mazatlan.

VOTERS DESERVE AN ALTERNATIVE
The time has come for an idea proposed 
by a southern congressman. He suggests 
that each ballot for an office, offer not 
only the names of the candidates seek
ing that office, but the alternative choice 
of none of the above.
In this way voters would not be forced 
to choose between the lesser of two evils. 
They could register their dissatisfaction 
with the candidates offered and demand 
a slate of more qualified candidates.
All too often we are forced to choose 
between candidates that fail to offer 
the qualities we want in an elected of
ficial. Because our political parties are 
just that, political, we find that those 
they support for office are often power
ful politically but totally lacking in ex
perience, integrity and ability.
In November, the situation existed in 
one of central Ohios larger cities, where 
the voters had the choice of an incum
bent, with whom they were dissatisfied, 
and a man who had a history of arrests 
for DWI, assault, and other misde
meanors and traffic violations.
Some choice. Even if they choose not 
to vote, they were still allowing some
one they did not approve of to take of
fice. Voters had no redress; no* way of 
expressing this disapproval or dis
satisfaction.
Perhaps this idea was mentioned in 
jest or will be viewed as a joke, but I 
believe that it has merit.
If a majority of voters rejected a slate 
of candidates, a new election would have 
to be held with a new slate of candidates. 
Some guidelines would be necessary 
concerning appointments to vacant of
fices until a new election was held and 
as to the number of times voters could 
demand a new election.
But 1 think the plan is workable, has 
merit and would be an asset to our 
democratic system where the people 
are supposed to have a voice.

LOCKERS FOR COMMUTERS
How can you tell a commuting student 
from a resident student? The difference 
is really not very hard to detect if you 
know what to look for during your 
search. Commuting students are those 
students who carry an armload of 
books around with them, or are con
tinually going back and forth to their 
car to get different books, or are in the 
bookstore buying a book for the second 
time because one was stolen.
Mrs. Land, Union Director, and Mike 
Wickersham, Student Association Presi
dent, believe they have a partial solu
tion to this problem of where do 1 
put my books between classes?" They 
have proposed the installation of lockers 
for commuting students in the Union 
Building.
These students definitely need a 
place in the Union where they can put 
their valuables. We have had a lot of 
complaints of stolen books, clothes, and 
purses, stated Mrs. Land.
These lockers would provide for com
muting students as well as dorm stu
dents who also need a place to put 
their books.

RAPE PREVENTION:
LIGHTS NOT GUILT
The rape prevention ads that run as a 
public service to the University Police 
may, at first glance, seem inoffensive. 
But by emphasizing the idea of a woman 
not placing herself in a situation (i.e. 
like being out alone at night) where she 
might be raped, they do shift some of 
the guilt to the womans shoulders. In 
fact, over one-half of all rapes occur in 
residences, a supposedly safe environ
ment.
A more constructive approach to rape 
prevention would be a campaign for the 
adequate lighting on campus. The Uni
versity Police know where attacks most 
frequently take place and these areas 
are poorly lighted at best.
If women tried to avoid all the poorly 
lighted areas on the University campus 
their movements would be severely 
restricted. If you have work to do at 
the library you cannot stay home simply 
because you cannot find anyone else 
who is going to the library. Stating that 
by avoiding certain parts of town any
one can avoid being raped will certainly 
comfort all those women who were 
raped in their own homes. Comments 
like I was not raped because I was 
careful further isolate women who 
were forcibly raped and brutalized.
Anything which in any way adds to 
the burden of guilt the rape victim 
faces should be avoided. There are 
more effective means of rape preven
tion, such as better lighting, which the 
University Police should work for. Lets 
concentrate on making it safer outside 
for women, not keeping women inside 
in fear.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY
The smoke you smell in the air this 
autumn may be more than burning 
leaves, it might be our Bill of Rights.
What is S.l? The alleged purpose is 
to revise and reform the United States 
Criminal Code, but the real purpose of 
important parts of the bill is to per
petuate secrecy and stifle protest. To 
go into detail would be long and tedious, 
but this bill could be used against law
ful and peaceful demonstrations, would 
permit official harassment of politically 
disfavored publications, and generally 
impinge upon many of our personal 
freedoms. The press has been virtually 
devoid of any real coverage of S.l. Dis
closure of information bearing the stamp 
confidential, secret and top secret is not 
a crime, except as to cryptographic and 
atomic energy information. If S.l were 
passed for instance: it would forbid the 
publication of the Pentagon Papers, and 
would put the editors of any publica
tions that exposed them in jail. If you 
protested the Viet Nam War or any 
protest in the future, S. 1 would put you 
in jail. One section of this bill (section 
1831), prohibits inciting ten or more 
persons to riot. The statute can be used 
to punish mere advocacy, even where 
no riot in fact occurs or where the con
nection between speech and violence is 
merely temporal. This clearly threatens 
our First Amendment rights. With so 
much pressure on people to get by, 
many of us cant afford the time it
would take to fight it.
The press has scored a victory in its 
coverage and handling of Watergate; if 
enough awareness is generated perhaps 
S.l can be defeated.
There are Senators and lawyers en
gaged in a struggle against its passage 
in its present form. If you are so motiv
ated to address yourself to this issue 
contact your Senator or Congressperson 
and let them know how you feel about 
it. At the present time we can still 
legally do so.

DRUNK BUTTERFLIES 
CLUSTERING FOR THE WINTER
Each year thousands of butterflies 
flutter to UCSB to amiably mingle with 
students for the winter. Few persons 
appreciate their presence or the in
credible distance they traverse to 
socialize with humans.
The Monarch Butterfly is that orange 
and black character found anywhere on 
the campus. This butterfly is a re
nowned migrant. Flying in undulating 
clouds of orange from as far as Hudson 
Bay they come to spend the winter in 
the warm southern climes of California 
and Florida.
These clouds of Monarchs travel at 
speeds up to 25 mph. Daytime flyers, 
the butterflies settle down upon fields 
at night. It was reported that the trees, 
when the foliage had already fallen, so 
completely covered with clinging 
masses of these butterflies as to present 
the appearance of trees in full leaf.
Every year the butterflies return to 
the same place. In Pacific Grove, Cali
fornia they make a majestic pilgrimage 
to a certain grove of pine trees. In their 
millions they land on several pine trees
 always the same trees.
The butterflies suck the thick sap that 
oozes from the branches and get cock
eyed. After drinking their fill they fall 
drunken to the ground, where they lie 
like an orange carpet, waving their in
ebriate legs in the air and shouting 
butterfly drinking songs. After a week 
of degradation they fly away, though 
not in clouds, as they face Monday 
morning singly or in pairs.
Because the butterflies live only six 
to nine months the common assumption 
is that the Monarchs around now are 
the children or grandchildren of those 
who went north last spring. How they 
know where to go and when to leave 
are some of the unanswered mysteries 
of nature.
The monarchs have not stopped 
migrating yet. Today they can be found 
in Australia, Sumatra, and Java to 
name a few new inhabitations. Ob
viously the Monarch Butterfly is no 
mere insect, but a worthy companion 
and deserving praise.

Dean Crecine: buildingji better mouse trap
with an attitude of deadly complacency, Crecine re
plied that he is going to give the student the best of 
both worlds. He will still be able to read alternative 
viewpoints, such as Walden. However, Crecine considers 
this work too abstract and believes the English or 
history major must leaven this abstraction with courses 
such as economics and political science in order to be 
able to think effectively and to achieve concr**ta results. 
Let it not be supposed, though, that Thoreau is without 
an answer for the Dean. In Walden, he retorts, Most 
men have learned to read to serve a paltry convenience, 
as they have learned to cipher in order to keep accounts 
and not be cheated in trade; but of reading as a noble in
tellectual exercise they know little or nothing. We are 
a race of dullards, and soar but little higher in our intel
lectual flights than the columns of the daily paper. 
What Thoreau is criticizing is the teaching of reading 
which stresses writing as a skill rather than as an outlet 
to critical thinking, which is precisely Crecines empha
sis.
Another benefit of the changes Dean Crecine envi
sions, perhaps the major one, is that the humanities ma
jor will now be able to get a job. By referring to his plan 
as a broadly-gauged, better mouse-trap, it is obvious 
that Crecine has tied education to the market place, an 
action Mills vehemently warns against in The Power 
Elite. Crecine tries to soothe these anxieties by saying 
that a proper mixture of liberal and vocational courses 
can be maintained, in spite of the pressures from the 
market place to channel education into being largely 
technically oriented. Crecine added that the industrial 
world is not monolithic and there will consequently 
still be room for divergence at the undergraduate level 
and in job opportunities. Doctor Eastman, head of the 
Department of English, and Doctor Schaefer both 
affirm that such a proper mixture will be maintained. 
Doctor Schaefer states that the student can learn to 
think critically with any subject, including urban histo
ry, although he is willing to admit that there are dangers 
if these courses shift their emphasis almost exclusively 
to the present.
Doctor Schaefer is not the only one who would find 
possible dangers in Crecines proposed modifications. 
Others would conclude that he is making the situation 
worse rather than better. In The Organization Man, a 
mildly prophetic work from the 1950s considering that 
Max Weber made similar predictions seventy-five years 
ago, William Whyte warns of the increasingly monolith
ic structure of industrial society. The group predomi
nates over the individual and the general tone is one of 
accomodation to the present: The organization man is 
to adjust to the group rather than vice versa; and the al
ternative of actually changing reality is hardly consider
ed. The corporate administrators or bureaucrats are ad
herents of comtemporaryism - the present, more 
than the past, is their model.
Whyte predicted with uncanny accuracy the changes 
that would occur in college curriculums because of the 
increasingly close union between the world of the 
organization and the college, which Whyte deplores just 
as Mills did. He envisioned the diminishing of liberal arts 
courses and the long term swing to vocational courses 
and even predicted the disguising of technical courses 
under liberal arts titles. For the current student, the 
curriculum he will take is just about as far removed 
from fundamental education as it is possible to get.
As far as these technical schools producing any note
worthy thinking, even in what is supposedly their own 
domain, Whyte states, There is no evidence that engi
neering schools have produced any appreciable number 
of fundamental scientists  Whyte also criticizes the 
teaching of communication as a separate skill. He writes, 
Nobody is quite sure yet just what communication 
amounts to, or, for that matter, whether it is really a 
separate discipline at all. In addition, he criticizes sur
vey courses, which is what the current freshman urban 
history course is at CMU, as failing to produce any indepth, meaningful analysis of alternatives.
To the objection that Whytes book was written dur
ing the 1950s and that it is no longer valid, it must be 
remembered that Whyte was discussing long term trends, 
which had little chance of being deflected. Significantly, 
listening to Dean Crecine, who received part of is educa
tion during the 1950s, is exactly like leafing through a 
few pages of the phrases and ideas that Whyte criticizes 
in his book. The inundating din that is resulting from the 
rattling back and forth of cliches and phrase-making 
across the campus is enough to deafen the student. 
Whyte also notes another characteristic of an organiza
tional society that was noticeable in the interview with 
Crecine: there is something amiss in the decision-making 
process. When trying to pin the Dean down on specifics, 
it became clear that there is a lack of clearness about 
who is deciding, what is being decided, and when it will 
be decided.
In Whytes book, he maintains that it will be possible 
to preserve individualism within the organization, al
though his equivocacy on this motion is enough to 
indicate his unsureness about the growth of personality 
testing in corporations, he believes that a science of 
men can not be made to work, that everyone can not 
be induced to be happy within the group. In fact, he 
includes in his book, in true Yankee fashion, a section 
on how the individual can outwit the personality tests.
In this instance, time has indeed dated Whytes views. 
In Behavior Mod, Philip Hilts discloses that most major 
corporations use behavior modification techniques and 
use them effectively. These techniques are used to 
increase profit ratios or to make the employees happy, 
but as Doctor Brethower, a corporate behavior modifier 
quoted in Hilts book, states, You can have anything 
you want. As Marcuse writes, There are no limits to 
the Happy Consciousness. Hilts cites instances in which 
employers became so enamoured with watching the 
arrows shoot up exponentially on the profit-ratio charts, 
almost as a young driver is fascinated by watching the 
sweep of the speedometer needle on his first time out 
on the super highway, that they applied increasing 
pressure until the employees virtually broke.
In line with this foreboding tone, Marcuse also warns 
that society is becoming increasingly monolithic. Ac
cording to him, the containment of social change is 
perhaps the most singular achievement of advanced 
industrial society. Highly productive technological soci
ety, by satisfying mans most basic needs for the first 
time in history, assimilates all alternative viewpoints and 
ways of thinking into its own: The inner dimension of 
the mind in which oppostion to the status quo can take 
root is whittled down. There is no room left for strict
ly individual patterns of thought. Mass production 
and mass distribution claim the entire individual, and 
industrial psychology has long since ceased to be con
fined to the factory. The end result is an attitude of 
surrendering to what is, in the belief that it is the only
viable alternative and the atrophy of the mental organs 
for grasping contradictions and alternatives.
Marcuse outlines the fate of the liberal arts in OneDimensional Man. The essence of art of higher culture 
is the Great Refusal against that which is, but, as has 
been seen the tendency of technological society is to 
eliminate any such alternative viewpoints. Marcuse 
maintains, The developing technological reality under
mines not only the traditional forms but the very basis 
of the artistic alienation--that is, it tends to invalidate 
not only certain styles but also the very substance of 
art. Today, the devient, the Hamlet or the Dostoevski, 
is sent to a psychoanalyst where his difficulties will be 
tidied up.
The ultimate result is that alternative ideas are re
duced to an innocuous fringe status. Marcuse states 
The absorbent power of society depletes the artistic 
dimension by assimilating its antagonistic contents. In 
the realm of culture, the new totalitarianism manifests 
itself precisely in a harmonizing pluralism, where the 
most contradictory works and truths peacefully coexist 
in indifference, Marcuse does not believe, as Crecine 
does, that the two cultures can coexist in a dynamic 
equilibrium, because when they are made to coexist the 
works of alienation are themselves incorporated into ad
vanced technological society and circulate as part and 
parcel of the equipment which adorns and psychoana
lyzes the prevailing state of affairs. Thus they become 
commercials--they sell comfort, or excite. Walden and 
The Closing Circle may still be taught but in a context 
that renders their assertions meaningless.
As Theodore Roszak states in The Making of a 
Counter Culture, the assimilative powers of the tech
nocracy would completely absorb and invalidate the 
counter culture of the 1960s, including those aspects of 
it which Roszak saw as desirable, and it would not be 
foolhardy to regard Roszaks premonitions as being 
realized. Although Charles Perry speculates in a recent 
issue of Rolling Stone (February 26, 1976) that greater 
social tolerance of deviant behavior and belief resulted 
from the counter culture experience, Perry acknowl
edges that the Haight was sacrificed to the mass mar
ket, to the news media and the swarms of unprepared 
people they lured there and also to the hustlers who 
quickly moved in on the community. Department 
stores started to sell mass-produced silver hippie jewelry 
and Buick used Morrisons Light My Fire as a pro
motional song and slogan. A recent Michelob commer
cial, which may be one of the most extraordinary 
documents of the coming age, offers the notion that 
only weekends are special and that they are the only 
time left for enjoyment. What this amounts to is that the 
American of today has completely surrendered almost 
five-sevenths of his life, when the carefree childhood and 
the two week vacation of the average worker are taken 
into account, to the technocracy. This is assimilative 
power of the highest magnitude.
Yet as Doctor Schaefer argues, a recognition of these 
dangers must not lead one to paralytic despondency. 
The final verdict is not yet in and one must not begin 
forewith to write odes to dejection. In this he 
echoes William Faulkner when in his Nobel Prize Ad
dress, he admonished, I believe that man will not 
merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not 
because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and 
sacrifice and endurance. The question is how much 
longer will significant numbers of people read these 
words and consider them significant.Imitartan

Functional Illiteracy in a Mass
2ep M/J
by Rick Costa 
I.
As Dean Crecine stated in an interview with the TAR
TAN, functional illiteracy represents more than a writing 
problem - it indicates an inability to think. He also 
pointed out that functional illiteracy is certainly not 
confined to the engineers on the Carnegie-Mellon cam
pus.
In The Power Elite, C. Wright Mills derives a major 
consequence from the functional illiteracy of Ameri
cans: he believes that the transformation of the United 
States from a society of publics, where rational, enlight
ened and thorough political discussion takes place, into 
a mass society can be traced to functional illiteracy or 
the inability to think. He posits two reasons for this de
ficiency. The first is the existence of a deadening, omni
present media whose only function is to reinforce pre
viously implanted patterns of emotional behavior and 
modes of thinking. Similarly, in One-Dimensional Man, 
Herbert Marcuse argues, The total mobilization of all 
media for the defense of the established reality has co
ordinated the means of expression to the point where 
communication of transcending contents becomes tech
nically impossible.
The second factor Mills cites is that mass education 
has become another mass medium. He writes, The 
prime task of public education, as it came widely to be 
understood in this country, was political: to make the 
citizen more knowledgeable and thus better able to 
think and to judge of public affairs. In time, the 
function shifted from the political to the economic: to 
train people for better-paying jobs and thus to get 
ahead. He adds, Many schools have come to operate 
on an ideology of life adjustment that encourages 
happy acceptance of mass ways of life rather than the 
struggle for individual and public transcendence.
Mills sees a similar deterioration in the quality of 
the nations leadership: George Washington in 1783 re
laxed with Voltaires letters and Lockes On Human 
Understanding, Eisenhower read cowboy stories and 
detective tales. Gerald Ford undoubtedly reads Star 
Trek novels. Mills concludes, What we are up against 
is precisely the absence of mind of any sort.
One prevalent characteristic of a mass society is what 
Mills refers to as the higher immorality. The public 
officials and administrators feel no responsibility for 
their actions, which can only be located with difficulty, 
and the inarticulate mass keeps them from realizing 
their guilt. In the same manner, Marcuse states, In the 
realm of the Happy Consciousness, guilt feelings has no 
place. Happy Consciousness, which is the token of 
declining autonomy and comprehension, is Marcuses 
term for what Mills refers to as the result of an ideology 
of life adjustment.
One need look no further than ones nose, which is 
usually the case anyhow, to see an example of this phe
nomenon; that is, to the article in Decembers Focus 
concerning functional illiteracy and Pat Hunts^ with
holding of the distribution of that issue. The crucial 
fact is that Hunt is convinced that he did nothing wrong. 
Hunt did not regard his actions as a form of censor
ship and added, I dont see it as a freedom of the 
press issue. (TARTAN January 13, 1976) Further
more, Hunt sees his main mistake in the fact that he 
didnt talk to the Focus editor while he had the issue 
hidden. The really bad thing is that on Saturday or 
Sunday I should have called Demarest. If youre look
ing for where I made a mistake, thats it, Hunt conclud
ed. This ignorance of any clear moral standards consti
tutes the higher immorality.
II.
Dean Crecine is currently instituting changes that he 
believes will improve the ability of CMU students to 
think and write. These include the possibility of a com
mon freshman year for H&SS majors, which would in
clude, possibly, courses in computer science, statistics
and economics. The English Department, which is cur
rently being reduced in size, is also miking a shift 
toward more writing courses, of which Dean Crecine es
timates 50% will be technically oriented. Incidentally, 
the changing of Literary Imagination to a writing course 
will be the main thrust of CITs solution to functional 
illiteracy. The net result will be a substantial reduction 
in the number of literature courses offered by the De
partment of English. When asked whether reading is per
haps the most effective way to learn to think, Crecine 
replied that the emphasis on writing in literature courses 
is often not rigorous enough.
Concerning the Department of History, Crecine was 
not sure if the percentage of history courses concentrat
ing on urbanization and modernization would increase 
in the future, but he was sure that it would not decrease. 
Presently, 20% of the History Departments undergrad
uate offerings concentrate on urbanization and modern
ization. At the current time, the principal freshman hi
story course for engineers is urban history, which was 
implemented in order to give the engineers subject ma
terial they could already relate to. The final outcome 
will depend on what kind of historians Carnegie-Mellon 
hires in the future. Doctor Schaefer, head of the Depart
ment of History, basically concurs with this prediction. 
Dean Crecine also revealed that H&SS is currently look
ing for an economic historian.
He is convinced that he will be offering the humani
ties student a better education, a more analytical educa
tion. The student will be better able to deal with reality, 
reality being a key word in Crecines vocabulary, and 
will actually be able to consider more alternatives and 
viewpoints, than the present liberal arts majors, who are 
often deficient in areas such as economics or political 
science. Crecine feels that a good criterion for a humani
ties education is that the humanities student be able to 
read the front page of the New York Times.
When asked whether this plan would actually restrict 
horizons of thought, in that the student will be learning 
mostly to adjust to the present technological society,

Society also tends to misunderstand modern art. 
Motherwell noted that the initial reaction to his art, 
among others, was that monkeys could do better. 
Just as everyone can not be an advanced mathematican, 
Motherwell contends that not everyone can understand 
art. Consequently, the modern artist needs to be his own 
man. Motherwell stated, There is nothing more difficult 
than to be an individual. It is very hard to find a bright 
youngster not in blue jeans.
Motherwell discussed the existential conflicts that 
he feels. For the contemporary artist, because of the 
ghastly historical events of the twentieth century, 
painting can no longer be as joyful as it was for the 
Fauves at the beginning of this century. Motherwell 
has done an extensive series of works on the Spanish 
Civil War, an event which disturbed many of those with 
leftist or republican sympathies during the 1930s, in
cluding Hemmingway, Picasso, and Orwell. Motherwell 
stated, The world is a dangerous place. There is a 
shudder in the universe, a crack that may be uncontrolable. He has named several of his paintings after pri
mordial caves in Europe, because he believes that the 
fear that primitive man felt in looking out of these caves 
corresponds to mans reaction to the current political 
and historical scene. In spite of this tragic sense in 
his work, Motherwell added, One has to be Spartan; 
one has to go on.
The Conflicts of Robert Motherwell
by Rick Costa
The portrait of Robert Motherwell given in a New 
York Times article of February 3 was very different 
from the one Motherwell presented of himself while 
lecturing at Carnegie Institute on February 18. The 
Times presented him as a serene master, contentedly 
surveying the niche that he has been placed into by 
society. With an agent who attends to his publicrelationss image and watching tv while he paints, 
Motherwell was viewed as snuggling into this role, 
complete with the usual appurtenances of a successful 
man.
On the contrary, the keynote of Motherwells short 
lecture at Carnegie Institute was the conflicts in his 
life. He stated, Modern art is filled with conflicts, it 
reflects the conflicts of our society. He even feels 
tensions with the physical environment, in that he be
lieves that the environment can decisively influence 
the quality of his work. For this reason he has two huge 
studios. One is located in Provincetown, Massachusetts, 
because he likes the quality of the light and the color 
of the ocean there. The other is in Conneticut, forty 
minutes from New York City, which he considers to still 
be the cultural hub of the world. He has constantly 
changed and added to these studios to get the proper 
physical surroundings. At his Conneticut studio, he add
ed a room that has the exact dimensions that a loft in 
New York city would have.
Motherwell also acknowledged that he feels a conflict 
in which approach he should take to art. Probably due 
to his background in philosophy at Stanford and Har
vard, Motherwell has often been criticized for being too 
intellectual. Yet, he admits that the atavistic impulses 
in his art are crucial. He emphasized the childishness 
of modern art and its ambivalence, mysteriousness and 
subconscious quality. He affirmed, In dreams, reality 
begins. He believes that the profession of the artist 
is an extremely sensuous one--touching the canvas and 
the different grades of paper and realizing the liquid 
quality of paint.
Motherwell, who began his career with a more controled form of Abstract Expressionism than Jackson 
Pollock and later experimented with color-field painting 
and a minimalist art employing open-ended shapes, 
also feels an obvious tension with the artists of the past. 
Art is a language, according to Motherwell, and the art
ist, who is involved in an ethical enterprise, must state 
the ultimate truths in constantly refreshing ways. The 
painter, like Joyce or American rock music, must forever 
change the language to keep it pure in order not to 
fall into cliche after cliche after cliche. To ensure that 
his works meet this standard, Motherwell places them on 
the wall next to works by Picasso or Matisse, among 
others, for a few weeks as a means of comparison. There 
can be no doubt that Motherwell must feel a strain in 
this competition with past masterpieces.
It was also evident that he feels tensions in just pro
ducing a painting. For one thing, according to his theory 
of painting, the artist must let the medium have control: 
the paintings must be allowed to grow, there is no way 
of forcing it. There is a restless quality to his works. He
must be working on one hundred projects at one time in 
many different techniques: collage, oils, lithograph, 
engraving. Motherwell affirms that there is an anxiety in
volved in just choosing which color to use when. 
Motherwell asked, Why should you use red rather than 
blue when both can be equally beautiful? His answer 
is to pick the one that comes closest to your inner 
tone, your inner gut, which may or may not be 
good in a moral sense. He adds that this anxiety of 
choice can also result in great joy.
In contrast to the impression created in the Times 
article, Motherwell stated that he feels in great conflict 
with society. The modem artist must oppose organized 
society, which can be a great burden. It is certain that 
he has felt this burden much more since he became 
successful. Society tends to debase authentic expres
sions. Motherwell noted the example of Mondrians being 
used as dress patterns. After his lecture, a woman asked 
him to sign her tablecloth, which had signatures of other 
famous men on it.

LA. EXPRESS, HALL. CARTER, HUTCH
Jazz, jazz, jazz. After years of predic
tions, come-backs, and steady progress, 
jazz music is more popular than ever. It 
is not surprising that jazz is gaining such 
commercial momentum. Jazz has branched 
off into all of the diverse areas that rock 
music had. In fact rock has become so 
intertwined with jazz that its impossible to 
separate the two.
The most important aspect about jazz 
is its universality. Even though jazz is an 
American invention (the only music form 
that America can take credit for) it is ac
cepted around the world. Jazz has found 
its way into the classical heart of Europe, 
the pulsating natural rhythms of African 
music, and even the country twang of 
Nashville cum America. There is no stand
ing definition of jazz but it is certainly one 
of the most experimental branches of mus
ic. The only people qualified enough to 
talk about jazz are those who play it and 
those who emerse themselves in the night 
clubs and the endless record lists that are 
available. Until recently jazz Mar not as 
accessible as rock or folk.' There is no 
Grand Ole Opry to go hear jazz and the top 
forty radio stations definitely do not play 
jazz.
There are many reasons why jazz is not 
as attainable as other forms of music. The 
best answer though is the sophistication of 
jazz. Even the funkiest rock/jazz is usually 
more complex than rock or folk music. 
Jazz is still an artistic expression, not a 
clever capitalistic device. I have never seen 
a jazz artist promoted by a record com
pany like the Beatles, Elton John or Bruce 
Springsteen. Lets hope it remains that 
way.
In the last few months, the*market has 
been flooded with new jazz releases. I 
thought that I should take the time to re
view a few of the better or more unique
albums. What follows is a short synopsis of 
some of the newest jazz pieces.
1. One of the best instrumental efforts 
of this young year is the L.A. Express. This 
is the same Los Angeles based band that 
has backed up Joni Mitchell, George Har
rison, and Tom Scott. Leader and saxaphonist Scott has gone on to bigger and 
better things but you would never know it 
from listening to this remarkable album.
2. Jim Hall Live is the second album on 
this list. 'Hall is an old jazz guitarist who 
has performed with Sonny Rollins and the 
legendary Duke Ellington. This particular 
performance was recorded and produced 
for disc by the new experimental jazz label, 
Horizon. Its a good recording as far as 
recordings go but the guitar work lacks a 
lot of the luster that studio recordings 
permit. All of Jim Halls guitar work is
Jim Hall's great effort is only worth a 6/4
The Express are tighter than ever and they 
play offf of each other in a marvelous 
way. All of the nine songs rock but they 
are a lot less funky than when Tom Scott 
was playing with them. Guitarist Robbin 
Ford has improved and the rest of the band 
seems to be following suit. My favorite 
cut is Down the Middle but every single 
song is extremely playable. Rate this al
bum a solid 9.
tasty but there is no substantial body to 
it. There is only a bass and drum for back
up so that tends to limit the direction. 
Probably some horns would have added 
a lot more depth to the total sound. Still, 
Jim Hall is one of the best conservative 
guitarists around. He is considered part of 
the illustrious circle that includes Django 
Reinhardt and Charles Christian. I believe 
that Jim Hall Live is a super effort but
this album is not for everyone. It will 
appeal only to hard core jazz fans such as 
the Charlie Parker worshipers. Jim Hall 
Live is a pre-rock/jazz performance that de
serves a 6/6.
3. Next comes Ron Carters Anything 
Goes. Carter is the premier bass player for 
Creed Taylor Incorporated. He has been 
recorded on more albums than anyone has 
bothered to count. Hubert Laws, Grover 
Washington, and Miles Davis are just a 
few of the many artists that he has contri
buted his amazing talent to. Ironically Car
ter has sold very few records even though 
he has helped other performers become so 
successful. Perhaps Anything Goes will 
change all that. Bob James helps out on 
the arrangements and the keyboard. The 
Brecker Brothers are on the roll call as is 
Eric Gale. The result is a fine combination 
of disco and rock/jazz. Carter has hooked 
his bass up to some sort of wah-wah syn
thesizer. Its a sweet album with a lot of 
potential but unfortuneately it does not 
live up to its full expectations because of 
minor distractions. I think that the biggest 
drawback is the label on which Carter rcorded Anything Goes. It sounds as if 
someone is holding Carter back from tak
ing his music to the edge of what ever it 
would take to make a very special jazz 
recording. I am not forgetting the better 
parts of this disc so Im awarding Any
thing Goes a 616.
4. Have you ever heard of Bobby Hutch
erson? Well hes a fantastic vibraphone 
player that deserves the attention that 
Gary Burton and Milt Jackson receive. A 
new jazz label entitled Up Front has re
leased a collection of Hutchersons past 
and unreleased works called Silver Rondo. 
There is very little that I know abut Bob
by Hutcherson but I assure you that some 
day he will be compared with people like

ERSON, LIEBMAN: RATINGSSUCHT
Lionel Hampton. Hutchersons arrange
ments are slick and he is as delicate a vibes 
player as can be found. There is no personel list on this recording but I guess that is 
what you deserve for a dollar and ninetynine cents. The Theme From Mash is 
included on this lovely album and the poly 
rhythms are sensational. Taking into con
sideration the fact that there is no personthere seems to be a song that sounds as if 
Mr. Duke is playing around at my expense. 
There are some great jazz people lending 
a hand but that doesnt stop George Duke 
from sounding like he is the son of a Frank 
Zappa nightmare. I havent forgotten the 
fine piano solos or the couple of original 
tunes so give this sucker a 5!4 for good 
behavior.
>avid Liebman's Sweet Hands album, from Horizon records
el and that the various cuts are from dif
ferent years, I still have to lay a 9 on Sil
ver Rondo. I have always been partial to 
good vibraphone players.
5. George Duke has a new release out 
entitled I Love the Blues. I have all the re
spect in the world for Duke who is Frank 
Zappas keyboard player but this album is 
just plain shaky. For every nice moment
6. Last but not least is the new David 
Liebman release Sweet Hands. Liebman is 
not exactly a household name when it 
comes to comparing saxaphone and flute 
players but he is well respected in his 
field. He has spent a great deal of time 
playing in ensembles of some of the 
worlds greatest jazz leaders. His most re
cent and noted boss was Miles Davis and

I had the pleasure of seeing the two in 
concert. Anyway, Sweet Hands is an inter
esting mix of many jazz styles. At times its 
rock/jazz then it transforms into some sort 
of wild avant grarde vamp. There is a great
deal of Indian influence which adds to the 
whole concept. Liebman is aided by 
Guitarist John Abercrombie as well as 
tabla player Badal Roy. Liebmans band is 
call Lookout Farm and they are a terrific 
accompaniment for Liebman. All of the 
songs are quite long and they, run through 
some nice changes that give plenty of time 
for some daring solos. The best part of 
Sweet Hands is not so much what Lieb
man and company accomplish but what 
they try to do. Like so many other talent
ed jazz artists, Lookout Farm is experi
menting and coming up with some radical 
new sounds. This one is a must for any 
jazz fan with a little adventure in them.
Sweet Hands is a 916 going on fifty. Listen 
once and youll know what I mean.
I hope that I have whetted your whistle 
for some new jazz albums and do not take 
offense at my rating system. I was using a 
system ranging from one to ten. To score 
a ten, a jazz artist or group would have to 
produce an album of unique quality that 
would inspire listeners without alienating 
them. It would have to have so many sides 
to it that any jazz fan would be able to 
appreciate it yet it would still be consider
ed progressive. This sort of album comes 
along approximately every fifth leap year 
so keep the faith and give all of these al
bums a listen.
Enjoying summer on February twenty - 
fifth.

One more thing. This is dedicated to 
Leonard Feather, Nat Hentoff, and the late 
Ralph J. Gleason, all of whom have forgot
ten more about jazz than I will ever know.

added,  .. . for the rooms. If it were up to 
me and more people wanted housing, I 
would use the lounges rather than turn 
people away. Steve Zalewski, Head of 
Campus Services Board said, We have no 
intentions of saying at a later date, We can 
really add one more. 
Zalewsky has stated that he believes the 
propsed housing budget to be as low as it 
can get. However, the budget that was 
originally proposed was higher, and Dean 
Williams said the same thing about the 
higher budget. While there is a possibility 
that this is true, the students cant tell. Ac
counting sheets that give the information 
are far too complex for shallow analysis. 
Maybe students would be willing to do 
some of the custodial work themselves to 
save some money. However, no breakdown 
of the custodial budget was available for in
spection by students at the time of the de
cision. The same is true for other areas of 
the housing budget.
In short, it is impossible for the students 
the students to know whether they are be
ing charged fairly for housing until the Ad
ministration provides clear, informative 
breakdowns of the major headings in the 
housing budget. I hope that the Adminis
tration will provide this information in a 
manner that is understandable to all stu
dents, and soon enough that if necessary, 
revisions could be made to the rate sched
ule before next year. It was suggested at 
the meeting than an efficiency expert be 
brought in to determine where problems 
exist, if they exist. This would only add an
other step to the bureaucratic red tape al
ready tangling the hosing problem. A sin
cere committee of students could do the 
job most effectively.

Page 14-THE TARTAN-March 2,1976

On Saturday, March 6, 1976 there will 
be a Magic theatre Cafe" Coffeehouse, at 
4515 Forbes Avenue, the Lutheran Univer
sity Center, featuring Country and Folk 
Music, locally produced, Flicks, coffee, ex
otic teas, cider, home made goodies. Ad
mission 50 cents and your mind.
The Museum of Art. Carnegie institute 
will present an exhibition by one of the 
outstanding photographers of the twen
tieth century, August Sander. Made pos
sible in part by a grant from the Pennsyl
vania Council on the Arts, the show will 
open on February 20 in Gallery D.
Born in Westerwald, Germany, Sander 
began making photographs during his 
teens. His dedication to the technical as
pects of photography and the camera soon 
developed into great professional skill. 
Sander served in die army between 1896 
and 1899, and his extensive travel through 
German cities and landscapes during these 
years spurred his interest in photography. 
His military service over, Sander turned to 
portrait photography and was almost im
mediately successful, receiving a gold med
al at a Paris exhibition in 1904, and a silver 
medal in 1909 at an exhibition in Linz.
Sander began to build a collection of 
portrait images of classes and types sur
rounding him daily in German society. The 
first volume of an intended series, People 
of the Twentieth Century, was published 
in 1929. The ruthless realism of Sanders 
portraits were in conflict with Nazi philosphy, and Sander was forced to terminate 
his project during the 1930s. Sander died 
in 1964, his ambition never fully realized.
The exhibition consists of approximate
ly sixty black and white photographs and 
includes both group and single sittings. The
individual portraits in this exhibition are 
not as important as the impression they 
create as a whole; Sanders art does not ex
plore individual psychology, rather the 
spirit of his age.
Photographs by August Sander will be 
on view Tuesday through Saturday from 
10:00 am until 5:00 pm and Sunday from 
1:00 until 6:00 pm through April 4. The 
Museum is closed on Monday.

THE TARTAN-March 2,1976-Page 15
TARTANS WIN ONE OUT OF THREE 
FOUR GAME WIN STREAK SNAPPED
by Bob Firm
Carnegie-Mellon ~sh owed shades of Uni
versity of Nevada-Las Vegas for the second 
time this season by reaching the century 
mark in a 100-67 shellacking of Washing
ton & Jefferson. The explosive offensive 
display atoned for the pitiful 14 point sec
ond half performance against the Presi
dents earlier in the season.
CMU moved the ball with picture per
fect passing to the open man for easy Tar
tan scores. Half of the buckets resulted 
from assists.
The Tartans used their hottest shooting 
of the year - a blistering 62% - to gain 
their fourth victory in a row. The streak 
represented CMUs longest in ten years.
Balanced scoring, a Tartan trademark, 
was again important. Four CMU players 
reached double figures. Marty Costa led all 
the scorers with 24 while still only playing 
a little more than half the game. Paul 
Hamerly pounded W&J for 20 inside tal
lies. Ralph DeaBrunzzo and Larry DiCicco 
did their usual outstanding jobs by scoring
18 and 12 points respectively.
The bench was not to be outdone by 
the starters as they came up with a scoring 
blitz of their own to make the 100 reading 
possible. Freshman Dave Schwartz scored 
on a fast break layup off of a Bill Boykins 
assist with ten seconds to go for the final 
hoop.
The victory evened CMUs record in the 
PAC at 6-6 while bringing the overall stand
ing to 6-11.
Paul Hamerly's 25 points and 16 rebounds were the highlight of CMU's Photos by

pion Hiram took full advantage of Camegie-Mellons foul trouble in' coasting to a 
101-85 triumph over the Tartans. The loss

Hiram ran wild for most of the second 
half to create a balanced attack that saw all 
five starters hit double figures. The Terriers 
were led by the conferences top two sco
rers, Tony Bolden and Ernie Pasqualone, 
who combined for 42 points.
The Tartans offensive output was gene
rated mostly by the radar accurate Ralph 
DeaBrunzzo with a seasonal high 30 points 
and Hamerly with 25.

snapped CMUs four game winning streak.
CMU was matching the Terriers basket 
for basket through most of the first half by 
mainly stopping the Hiram fast break 
and having few problems with the Ohio 
colleges pressure defense.
However, Hiram appeared to be just a 
step quicker than CMU which leads to poor 
defensive positioning and ultimately to 
fouls.
With about 15 minutes gone in the first 
half, the parade of foul plagued Tartans to 
the bench began. Larry DiCicco picked up 
his fourth. He was rapidly followed by 
Marty Costa with his third personal and 
Paul Hamerly with four.
The Hiram fast break machine that was 
shut down when all five Tartan starters

CMU DROPS HEARTBREAKER 
TO GENEVA 73-68
by Bob Firm
A gallant Carnegie-Mellon five battled 
back from a 15 point deficit midway 
through the second half only to see their 
comeback efforts fall just a little shy in 
dropping a heartbreaking 73-68 decision to 
visiting Geneva.
The Tartans could not get the big breaks 
late in the game to put them over the top 
after knotting the score at 64, 66, and 68.
After Paul Hamerly put the Tartans 
ahead 2-0 15 seconds into the contest, 
Geneva ran off 15 unanswered points. The 
invaders margin was built mainly on second 
and third chances at the hoop and easy 
buckets set up by the penetration of Spen
cer Johnson.
The 5-4 dynamite captain wreaked 
havoc against the CMU defense by driving 
past as many as four players on several 
occasions for easy layups of hitting the 
open man for other Geneva scores. He end
ed the game with 18 points and seven 
assists.
CMU broke the cold spell on Dane 
Wukichs jumper at the 13:40 mark. 
However, the Tartans couldnt even buy a 
bucket for most of the first half as they 
only shot 21% for the opening stanza.
The Tartans were kept in the game by 
the efforts of Hamerly. The junior co-captain scored 11 of his game high ^5 markers 
and snatched 11 of his 16 rebounds in the 
first half.
Most of CMUs problems were caused 
by lack of penetration in Genevas zone 
defense. The Tartans were forced to take 
poor percentage shots. The crisp passing 
that produced many CMU hoops in pre
vious games was absent in the first half.
Still, the Tartans refused to give up and 
started chipping away at Genevas 
advantage from the opening blitz. The 
visitors, employing a poor imitation of the 
North Carolina four corner offense, saw 
the Tartans whittle away at their lead late 
in the half. Larry DiCiccos two free 
throws brought CMU back to within nine, 
37-28 at the intermission.
Hamerly and DiCiccos quick baskets at 
the beginning of the second half cut some 
more of Genevas lead, but the opponents 
used more of their first half medicine to 
balloon the margin back to 15.
CMU started their tremendous come

side to Hamerly for an unmolested layup.
The play brought the excellent turnout 
to life. The large crowd, which included 
such noteworthy sports personalities as
1976 Heisman Trophy candidates Dick 
West and Tony Dorsett and WIIC broad
caster Dee Thompson, was to be a major 
factor in the Tartans late heroics.
Spurred on by chants of Lets Go 
Tech, the Tartans created a scoring spree 
of their own. Ralph DeaBrunzzo, whose 
jumper had been silent most of the night, 
canned two from long range. DiCicco and 
Wukich connected to bring CMU to within 
three, 63-60.
A big blow to the Tartans comeback 
occurred when DiCicco left the contest via 
the foul route with a little over four 
minutes remaining. After Terry Wiley con
verted a free throw to give Geneva a four 
point lead, CMU tied the game for the first 
time since the opening minute on two 
pointers by Hamerly and DeaBrunzzo.
Wiley converted two more charity 
tosses at the 3:03 mark to give Geneva a 
66-64 lead. DeaBrunzzo tied it again 15 
seconds later on an 18 foot jumper.
Wiley, who lead the Geneva scoring with
19 tallies, got an easy fast break bunny to 
again push his team to a slim advantage. 
Wukich evened the count when he banked 
home a winner from 20 with two minutes 
to go.
CMU responded to cries for DE
FENSE! by stopping Geneva the next 
time down the floor. However, Wukichs 
jumper that tied the game at 68 was not 
true to form in the Tartans bid for the 
lead.
Johnson put Geneva ahead to stay, 70- 
68 with 1:45 left on a short jumper. Dea
Brunzzo missed the mark with 1:15 re
maining, Geneva controlling the rebound. 
Johnson was off on a 15 foot attempt with 
less than a minute remaining in the en
counter. A struggle for the loose ball result
ed in a jump ball which was handled by 
Geneva.
Wiley again was put on the spot when 
Hamerly used his fifth personal to stop the 
6-4 sophomore on a blocked shot call that 
antagonized the crowd with 29 ticks left 
on the clock. He hit on one of this two 
tries to give Geneva a 71-68 lead.
CMUs final offensive effort came on a 
missed turnaround jumper by Marty Costa 
with 20 seconds left. Pat Ward came down 
with the rebound and was tied up.
Geneva controlled the tap and had a 
fast break going when DeaBrunzzo hustled 
back and blocked the layup attempt. Wins
ton Thomas grabbed the ball for CMU but 
again was tied up with : 10 showing on the 
clock.
Again the visitors controlled and Ernie 
Clipper was immediately fouled. He
choked away the first shot of a 1 and 1, 
but Geneva got the rebound and iced the 
victory on two foul shots by Terry Hub
bard.
The home finale for the Tartans was an 
exciting game, as all contests at Skibo 
Gym were this season. CMU came back 
against tremendous odds that included not 
shooting a free throw in the second half to 
turn a lackluster performance into a game 
that had the fans on the edge of their 
seats for the final few minutes.
The victory gave Geneva, CarnegieMellons oldest rival, a 70-38 advantage in 
a series that dates back tC> 1907. The Tartans record was lowered to 6-13.___________

THE TARTAN-March 3. 1976-Page 17
The Carnegie-Mellon University wom
ens varsity basketball team split their last 
four games over the last two weeks by win
ning two to keep their record at .500, now 
at 5-5.
Two weeks ago, Duquesne beat CMU 
64-52 on Monday, with CMU beating W&J
52-25 on Wednesday. Barb Owens 
led CMU against Duquesne 
by scoring 20 points and 14 points, respec
tively. Elly Zimmerman scored 14 and 12.
Last week, Indiana University of Penn
sylvania beat CMU 95-44 on Friday night 
while CMU beat California State College of 
Pennsylvania 64-29 on Saturday. In front 
of a standing room only crowd here at 
CMU, Indiana used their height and speed 
to cause a record number of turnovers. The 
game started out very slowly, with neither 
team doing much scoring. Suddenly, Indi
ana scored 15 straight unanswered points 
and stretched their lead to 21 points by 
halftime. After halftime, the game was 
never in doubt, with CMU hot getting any 
closer than the 21 point dficit of the first 
half. Barb Owens led the CMU team with 
19 points and 22 rebounds. Elly Zimmer
man had 11 points and 6 rebounds, and 
Karen Azinger had 8 points. Mary Patrick 
and Ann Michelson also had 6 rebounds. 
On Saturday, the revenge was sweet for the 
CMU team when they crushed California 
64-29. Earlier in the season, California beat 
CMU 71-70 in overtime. This time, the 
CMU team got an early lead and never quit. 
They built the lead up to 26 points by halftime (37-11). CMU used a full court press 
to cause California to turn over the ball nu
merous times on traveling violations and 
throw away passes, which turned into easy 
baskets. Whenever CSC broke the press, 
CMU played a tight defense, which only al
lowed poor shots. There were no second 
chances for CSC because they only had a 
few offensive rebounds. Elly Zimmerman 
led the scoring with 30 points and Barb 
Owens had 18 points. Barb led all rebound
ers with 21, while Mary Patrick had 11, 
Elly had 7, and Marianne Vakiener had 6 
rebounds.
Only call what
by Elly Zimmerman
For the past twenty years, CMU has had 
a renowned football referee among its 
ranks. Earl Birdy, CMUs Intramural Direc
tor has refereed nationally televised colle
giate games such as the 1974 Orange Bowl 
(Penn State-LSU) and the 1962 NorthSouth game held in Miami.
Football referees have received national 
attention recently because of episodes of 
bottle wielding fans and disputes resulting 
from instant replay.
This technological advance allows im
mediate condemnation or affirmation of a 
referees decision which may make referee
ing obsolete in the future.
Birdy commented that instant replay is 
good for the fans but shouldnt be used in 
rulings because it would take two days to 
play a game. However instant replay 
could be an invaluable asset to reducing 
crowd dissension at the stadiums.
The recent injury of a national football
you see. says
referee resulting from a thrown bottle may 
have been prevented if instant replay were 
available to the fans. The problem of fans 
throwing objects at the refs is a major one. 
Once I had a coke bottle thrown at me at 
a local game, Birdy recalled. It didnt 
hit me, fortunately. Another time I re
member wine bottles were thrown out on 
the field. The official rules state that the 
home team is responsible for the fans 
conduct. Birdy feels possible solutions 
would be more security and improved pub
lic relations. We have to educate the fans. 
They dont realize that this is actually en
dangering the life of the official. He 
added that he felt the primary reason for 
the fans getting upset is that they dont 
understand the rules.
Referees spend hours studying and in
terpreting the rules. To miss a rule is a 
real officiating sin, anyone that blows a 
rule is really in trouble, Birdie commen
ted. Besides studying the rule book the 
referees must also be able to keep up with

the fast pace of the game or else pay the 
consequences. Most referees would rather 
face a flying bottle than a 260 pound, 66 
football player traveling at 20 miles per 
hour.
Birdy experienced such a danger when 
he was hit from behind by a Yale player in 
the 1972 Yale-Harvard game. Besides 
breaking both bones in his lower left leg, 
he also dislocated his elbow. The injury 
sidelined him for weeks...three weeks in 
the hospital, six weeks in a wheelchair 
and more in various casts. He returned 
to ref the 1973 season. I limped a lot 
but I worked, Birdy said. The benefits 
of such an occupation outweigh the 
hazards however as Birdy mentioned the 
great feelings of satisfaction aftef 
refereeing a good game. A lot of exciting 
things happen in football he said referring 
to a pre-game show at the Penn State 
Iowa game. A fan waving an Iowa pen
nant sprinted 120 yards wearing only a 
baseball cap and tennis shoes.
Equally exciting was Birdys unforget
table call. After raising his arms to signal 
a touchdown he realized he was standing 
on the five yard line, not the goal line.

DUKES DUMP ICERS 
AND ATTACK FANS
by Mary K. Groupe
There was a hockey game scheduled for 
Saturday February 28 between CarnegieMellon and Duquesne. But much of that 
2^-hour game was devoted to verbal and 
physical skirmishing: between the two 
clubs, between the Duquesne bench and 
the CMU fans, and between the referees 
and irate players. The final score of Du
quesne - 7, CMU - 5, included three highly 
questionable Duquesne goals.
The game got off to a slow start, with 
six shots on goal for each team in the first 
period. One of those - a shot which 
bounced off the upper crossbar -- put Du
quesne on the scoreboard when the ref
erees ruled that it had bounced out of the 
net. There were only two penalties in that 
period: a statistic that was soon to change. 
CMU would end up with 13 penalty min
utes, to Duquesnes 2S; in addition, each 
team had a game misconduct.
By 1:02 in the second period, Duquesne 
had scored another dubious goal. Although 
the Tartans pointed out that defenseman 
Bill Thompson had been on top of the 
puck when the whistle sounded, and that 
therefore it could not have been inside the 
goal, the Dukes received the benefit of the 
referees ruling. Dave Barbe (Duquesne) 
drew his second penalty at 2:41, and the 
Tartans promptly took advantage of the 
5 on 4 lineup, as Jack Arturo put in the 
first CMU goal on a pass from Dave Corne
lius. But the next Duquesne penalty did 
not work so well for the Tartans. Du
quesnes Tim Boyland got a breakaway and 
scored shorthanded, making it 3-1. There 
were two more Duquesne penalties at 5:29 
and 10:36, but the big excitement came on 
a whistle at 11:29.
Dave Cornelius (CMU) and Tom Barnes 
of Duquesne were called for roughing; 
Barnes also drew a 10-minute misconduct 
for hassling the referees. After an exchange 
of verbal abuse between the two in the 
penalty boxes, Barnes leaped back onto the 
ice and started to go for Cornelius. Players 
from both teams grabbed him, and the 
referees proceeded to throw Barnes out of 
the game.
Meanwhile, some CMU fans had been 
giving the Duquesne bench a hard time, 
and the Dukes were reaching over the back 
glass, yelling and swinging at the crowd. 
They did manage to break three of their 
sticks in that atrocious display of poor 
sportmanship. The Arena police moved in 
to break it up and directed the CMU stu
dents to another part of the stands. The 
referees decided that the second period 
had better stop at that point, and the 3:31 
time remaining was to be added onto the
third.
When play resumed, the goalies returned 
to their second-period nets and the clock 
started at 11:29. CMU had a man advan
tage now and at 12 :36 Mike Gallaway sent 
the puck over to Larry Stuever, who put 
in the second CMU goal: Tartan goalie 
Doug Johnston and various skaters were 
milling around way out in front, allowing a 
Duquesne skater to get away with the puck 
and tuck it neatly into the net. Shots on 
goal for the whole second period were 
CMU: 13, Duquesne: 9, and the Tartans 
were still down 4-2.
So the goalies and skaters switched ends 
to start the third period. At 2:13, Mike 
Gallaway knocked down an airborne puck 
with his glove and put in a beautiful shot 
from about the right faceoff circle. Larry 
Stuever tied it up for CMU at 5 :31. A pass 
from Bill Miller gave Stuever a breakaway; 
he faked the goalie out and scored the 
fourth Tartan goal.
At 6:36 came a flurry of penalties 
which rivalled the second period total. A1 
Yobbi of Duquesne jumped Jack Arturo 
from behind and Dave Cornelius dashed in
to the fray. At 6:28, Jack received 2 min
utes for (interestingly enough) interfer
ence, as well as 5 minutes for fighting. 
Yobbi drew only a 5-minute major, and 
Cornelius was kicked out of the game for 
being the third man in a fight.
The Tartans were understandably an
noyed and started hustling. A pass from 
Matt Goldsmith to Larry Stuever out on 
the point put CMU in the lead, 5-4, and 
gave Stuever his second hat trick of the 
year. But that was it for the CMU club.
Thirty seconds later, a Duquesne shot 
just after a faceoff went through John
stons legs, and a mere 13 seconds after 
that, Tim Boylan gave Duquesne the goahead goal. C.H. Bender brought the score 
to 7-5 on another highly suspicious goal, 
which followed a double roughing call 
against Bender and Matt Goldsmith. C.H. 
was coming out of the box when a Du
quesne skater passed the puck out of their 
defensive zone. While everyone else was 
still in the zone, CJL broke away with the 
puck and scored. However, according to 
NCAA rules, a skater coming out of the 
penalty box cannot receive a pass at mid
ice from his defensive zone. The referees 
hemmed and hawed over that one, and fi
nally said they couldnt remember where 
the pass had originated.
The questionable refereeing coupled 
with the outbursts by the crowd and play
ers created a tense atmosphere affecting 
CMU adversely. The team lost again leaving

On Monday, February 16, the CarnegieMellon hockey club faced an old WPIHA 
rival, Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
Although the Tartans dominated through
out the game, they suffered a narrow 3-2 
defeat in the final minutes of pldy.
The CMU icers blew some unbelievable 
chances for goals in the first period. They 
outshot IUP 10 to 6, but their shots went 
wide, or bounced off the post, or anywhere 
but into the net. The Tartans shooting was 
inaccurate this period, but their goaltending was excellent. The Indians stood in the 
opposite position: their good shots were 
stopped by Marty Bradley (in goal for 
CMU), but their own goalie was riding a 
wave of good luck. So nobody scored.
The deadlock lasted through most of 
the second period. At 14:05, a BuntingSanders play from the top of the right face
off circle produced the first goal for Indi
ana. There were a few penalties in each of 
the three periods, but neither club could 
capitalize on them for a power play goal.
An early third-period goal for the Tar
tans was disallowed by a ruling that Mike 
Gallaway had thrown the puck into the 
net. But at 7:47, Mike tied it up for CMU 
anyhow. Mark Jannotti had passed the 
puck to Larry Stuever, who was breaking 
out of the defensive zone. Larry successful
ly carried the puck across the blue line and 
got off a pass to Gallaway, who took it in
for the goal. About three minutes later, 
CMU took the lead. Again the play began 
with Mark Jannotti, who wrangled the 
puck away from an Indiana skater. Mark 
passed it to Skip Wallace, waiting in the 
slot, who knocked it in for the Tartans.
Had this game followed the WPIHA tra
dition of 15 minute periods, the Tartans 
would have had the victory. Unfortunately, 
the periods ran 20 minutes: Indiana scored 
again at 17:08 and at 17:18. In a flurry of 
action in front of the CMU net, with the 
Tartans unable to clear the puck, an Indi
ana shot from 20 feet away bounced off 
the post and into the goal. That tied it, and 
ten seconds later, an Indiana skater caught 
a pass from the boards, ducked behind a 
Tartan defenseman, and slammed in their 
third goal.
With 1:10 left to play, the Tartans 
pulled their goalie and sent a sixth skater 
onto the ice. Several good shots had gone 
awry when Indiana got the puck away and 
broke for the open net. Jack Arturo rushed 
into the goal for an impressive kick save, 
and the Tartans headed back to the IUP 
zone with 25 seconds to go. But as in the 
rest of the game, the puck seemed to meet 
a magnetic repulsion at the goal line, and 
every shot was turned aside.
This was a disappointing loss for the 
Tartans. The Indianswho have not beaten 
CMU in a couple of years were naturally 
elated. But for the Tartans, it was another 
of those late-third-period losses which have 
plagued the club so often this year.co tartan

SAE has proven to be the surprise team

in their upset win over ATO to guarantee 
them a playoff spot. Hanna and Schiffman 
both finished in the top ten in scoring.
The Orangatangs - Black Heat winner

Black Heat, the sleeper team, has lost 
only to the three teams above them. Earlier

the Orangatangs. They are a quick scrappy 
team with really no individual stars but 
still have had a successful season.

THE STROH BREWERY COMPANY, DETROIT, MICHIGAN 48226
by Roger Geddes
Pride and Beta Theta Pi have succeeded 
in landing byes for the first round of the 
playoffs by posting the best major league 
record of 9-2. Pride receives the first spot 
by way of a two point win over Beta.
Pride relies on the good shooting and 
quickness of their two guards Mike Hop
kins and Gerald Coates who average about 
twenty-five points together. The burden of 
their rebounding is done by tall center 
Mark James who also averages about four 
blocked shots per game. Prides only losses 
came at the hands of ATO and the Oranga
tangs.
Beta has gathered the momentum into 
the playoffs by winning their last seven 
straight. Bob Schulmans 22 points engi
neered their big win over ATO, 54-42, that 
gave them the right to a second place bye 
spot. Betas strength lies in their quick 
shooting and fast breaks. Their only losses 
were to Pride and the Orangatangs.
The winner of the ATO-SAE game earns 
the right to play Beta. ATO looked to be 
strong favorite earlier in the year until 
losing to Beta and then being upset by SAE 
last week, 5544. Their superior rebound
ing gives them a slight advantage in the 
playoffs but the loss of OMara to an injuryOhio State Wins Saranac Tourney

CMUs bid for the Saranac Tennis Tour
nament cup fell short of its hopes this 
weekend when the team earned a 0-4 
record in its division. The tournament was 
held at the Alpine Racquet Club in Pitts
burgh. Twelve universities from the east 
were entered, CMU, Edinboro State 
College, Bucknell University, Indiana Uni
versity of PA., Ohio State University, 
Duquesne University, West Liberty College, 
University of Maryland, Kent State Univer
sity, Slippery Rock College, Robert Morris 
College, and University of Pittsburgh. In 
their division CMU lost to four teams, 
Slippery Rock 21-18, Bucknell 26-17, IUP 
25-17, and West Liberty 24-21.
CMU did show merit however, as the 
mens doubles were undefeated against the 
four teams in the division, and in that the 
team narrowly missed beating both West
Liberty (the division winners) and Slippery 
Rock by three points.
Defending champion Ohio State beat 
the University of Maryland in the finals on 
Sunday. After the matches, Jim Banner, 
CMUs Athletic Director presented the 
trophies to the winning teams. CMU was 
the host team for the tournament.
Under world team tennis rules each 
game won is worth one point, each match 
consisting of mens and womens singles, 
mens and womens doubles, and mixed 
doubles. Only one set is played, and the 
first side to win six games is declared the 
winner. The winning margin must be two 
games.
Playing for CMU were; Gary Kemeny - 
mens singles, Ellen Bernstein - womens 
singles, Robin Klar and Gary . Kemeny - 
mixed doubles, Chuck Carroll and Marc 
Silver - mens doubles, Robin Klar and El
len Bernstein - womens doubles.The Steeler's Larry Brown showed the IM All Stars how the game should be played . 
In last year's game the Steeler's superior ball handling gave them the victory 48-45.

On Friday March 5 th the Super Bowl 
Champion Pittsburgh Steelers will be com
ing to the Skibo Gym to play the Intra
mural All-Stars. The action will start at 
8:30. Preceding the game the intramural 
finals will be played at 7:00 and the intra
mural awards will be presented at 8:00.
All students, faculty, and staff members 
are invited. Admission is free with CMU 
ID. ALL STUDENTS MUST BRING IDS

The Steelers have won the game two 
years in a row now with the scores of 
51-50 and 48-45. Franco Harris came 
in 1974 followed by Larry Brown in 1975. 
John McMakin, Jerry Mullens, Dave
