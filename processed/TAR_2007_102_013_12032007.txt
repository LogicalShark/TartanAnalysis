The Carnegie Mellon-led Million Book Proj
ect announced Wednesday that it has success
fully put over 1.5 million books online.
Founded and directed by School of Com
puter Science professor Raj Reddy, the Mil
lion Book Project has purportedly surpassed 
similar scanning projects such as Google Book 
Search and The Internet Archive. The project is 
supported by two grants totaling $3.6 million, 
partners from Chinas Zhejiang University and 
the Chinese Academy of Science, the Indian 
Institute of Science, and Egypts Bibliotheca 
Alexandrina. These partners contributed scan
ning facilities and personnel, trained by Car
negie Mellon University Libraries. The project 
supplies scans in subjects ranging from politics 
and religion to science and engineering in over 
20 languages.
The archives website www.ulib.org states 
that the principal benefit of the venture will 
be the even distribution of library materials 
across different levels of education.
Citing that university libraries often hold 
the majority of volumes available in America, 
while public and secondary school libraries 
have much smaller collections, the project
""A F"E-HE EeF JF A AU
currently makes available a university-scale li
brary to anyone with an Internet connection at 
a nominal cost to educational budgets.
While the projects main goal to scan all 
books on Earth was believed impossible, it was 
able to bring 1.5 million selected books to the 
Internet in a little less than two years.
While this is still less than 1 percent of all 
available works in the world, directors agreed 
in a November 2007 conference to continue 
and expand the venture, which can greatly 
shorten the time required to complete the proj
ect.
Interestingly, the archive sports over 
970,000 volumes in Chinese, at least two and 
a half times more than those in English, while 
both languages significantly dwarf all others 
ranging from Hindi to Russian. Project partner 
Zhenkun Zhou, visiting scholar at Carnegie 
Mellons School of Computer Science, explains 
that more people work for this project in China 
than other participating countries.
In order to get the Chinese governments 
support, we have to digitize many Chinese 
books, Zhou explains. At least one-fifth of the 
over 1,000 workers in this project operate in 
Zhejiang University alone.
Zhou added that copyright issues, a major

For the first time in seven years, 
Carnegie Mellons Student Senate 
is full.
As of Nov. 15, all 38 seats are 
occupied by students representing 
all undergraduate colleges and 
programs: Tepper School of Busi
ness (4), College of Humanities 
& Social Sciences (7), Carnegie 
Institute of Technology (10), 
College of Fine Arts (6), Mellon 
College of Science (5), School of 
Computer Science (4), and com
bined Bachelor of Humanities 
and Arts, Bachelor of Science and 
Arts, and Science and Humanities 
Scholars programs (2).
I am proud because this is the 
first time in seven years that all 
of the seats have been occupied. 
With a full Senate, we can bet
ter represent the interests of the 
full student body, said Jared 
Itkowitz, a junior business admin
istration major and Senate Chair.
In addition, Senate will now 
be able to fulfill all its duties 
and accomplish more work in a 
smaller amount of time, Itkow
itz said.
Last year the membership 
varied from 32 to 36, with MCS 
and CFA seats often staying va
cant, according to Itkowitz.
This year for the vacancy 
election in MCS, 12 people ap
plied for just two spots. This 
kind of interest from the stu
dents in that college is simply 
fantastic, Itkowitz said.
Student Senate plays a large 
role in student life on campus. 
One of its main duties is to work 
with the Joint Funding Commit
tee on special allocation funding 
for student organizations.
Itkowitz noted that a full sen
ate allows for more efficiency in 
campus change, specifically in 
three main areas  campus life, 
which includes issues such as

Middle East 
takes steps 
to peace
by Mark R. Rudnick
Junior Staffwriter
On Tuesday and Wednes
day of last week, Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders met in An
napolis, Md. at the invitation of 
President Bush to discuss peace 
negotiations between their 
two parties. Also present at 
the meeting were leaders from 
across the globe, including the 
European Union, United Na
tions, and the Arab world.
This event marked the 60th 
anniversary of the Partition 
Plan for Palestine.
The Plan, devised by the 
United Nations General As
sembly, divided what was then 
Palestine into distinct Jewish 
and Palestinian states. It was 
that decision that solidified the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict as 
the dominant political struggle 
in the Middle East that remains 
today.
Once again, Israelis and Pal
estinians stand at an important 
point in their collective his
tory  on par with the June 
1967 Six-Day War or the Oslo 
Accords of the 1990s  that 
might shape the future for the 
two groups.
Senior Hanadie Yousef, 
chemistry major and public 
relations chair of the Arab Stu
dent Organization, expressed 
optimism as to what the confer
ence could accomplish.
I do believe it is a good 
start, Yousef said. This is the 
first time Palestinian and Is
raeli leaders are meeting with 
the stated goal of solving the 
core issues: the status of Jeru
salem, the Palestinian refugees, 
borders, and water and natural 
resources.
In the weeks leading up to 
the meeting, a great deal of 
uncertainty about what would 
be discussed at the meeting led 
many world leaders to serious
ly doubt the usefulness of sumSee PEACE, page A3
Mock trial team 
goes to court
by Sabrina Porter
Assistant News Editor
The Cathedral of Learning 
bore witness to the civil and 
criminal trials of multiple defen
dants this weekend. Among the 
defendants, lawyers, and wit
nesses were 18 Carnegie Mellon 
students  the members of the 
mock trial team.
Carnegie Mellon Mock Trial 
came in fifth place out of 23 
teams at the second annual 
Steel City Invitational, hosted by 
the University of Pittsburgh. The 
event invited schools nation
wide to partake in a four-round, 
two-day competition.
In addition, two individual 
team membersSudeep Paul 
and Andrew Robbreceived 
the Attorney Award and Best 
Witness Award, respectively.
The University of Pittsburgh 
and Carnegie Mellon faced over
15 competitors, including teams 
from Georgetown University, 
the University of Michigan-Ann 
Arbor, and Cornell University.
The invitational was one 
of many in the years season 
that put Carnegie Mellon up 
against its national competitors, 
Michigan being one of its most
consistent threats.
However, Carnegie Mellon 
has managed to set itself apart 
from its competitors.
A trademark of the Carnegie 
Mellon team is its existence as a 
completely student-run organi
zation. Unlike universities such 
as Georgetown and the Univer
sity of Michigan, the team does 
not have a faculty coach or an 
associated law school.
Since Carnegie Mellon lacks a 
pre-law program, the 18 mem
bers of mock trial come from all 
different colleges and majors.
We have been practicing for 
three hours every night this 
week, said Anand Durvasula, 
senior economics major and 
mock trial president. What 
many people dont realize is how 
much memorization is involved 
in mock trial. We have to know 
everything about our cases.
Each case is just so intense, he 
added, none without romance, 
jealousy, and drama. Past cases 
have included a tennis profes
sional hit in the shoulder in a 
road rage attack and criminal 
cases complicated by extramari
tal affairs.

Nicholas Sullivan talks on his book
by Annika Rosenvinge
Staffwriter
Last Tuesday, the question was 
not Can you hear me now? but 
whether those in the third world 
will be able to hear you via cell 
phone. The man posing the ques
tion was Nicholas P. Sullivan, 
author of You Can Hear Me Now: 
How Microloans and Cell Phones 
are Connecting the Worlds Poor to 
the Global Economy, as he spoke 
to a group of students and faculty 
in Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Hall.
Sullivan, a graduate of Har
vard University and the Fletcher 
School of Law and Diplomacy 
at Tufts University, has been at 
the forefront of writing about 
the intersection of technology, 
business, and globalization in the 
information age. While working 
as editor of Inc.com, the online 
version of the business trade pub
lication Inc. magazine, Sullivan 
became interested in the pros
pect of implementing technology 
in the developing world.
Sullivan has credentials in the 
business world which qualify him 
as a sought-after specialist on in
vestment in emerging markets. 
He has consulted for numerous 
Fortune 500 CEOs and continues 
to work as a business consultant. 
Sullivan also compiles the Wealth 
of Nations Index, which annu
ally ranks 70 developing coun
tries, and has led conferences for 
the United Nations relating to 
finance, investment, and devel
opment in the third world.
His most recent work was in the 
form of his latest book, in which 
he chose to document how tech
nology can empower third world 
populations through the success
ful new system of microloans.
The concept of Microloans 
was pioneered by 2006 Nobel 
Peace Prize Winner Muham
mad Yunus, an economist from 
Bangladesh and founder of the 
Grameen Bank. The bank serves 
as a catalyst in the development 
of socioeconomic conditions by 
granting microloans without col
lateral, which allows the Third 
World poor to launch their own 
business ventures and improve 
their lives.
Economist Iqbal Quadir creat
ed an offshoot of Grameen Bank 
in GrameenPhone, a cooperative 
effort by corporations and pov
erty-stricken rural inhabitants in 
Third World countries to reverse 
the pattern of top-down devel
opment. Norlntel, a Norwegian 
cell phone company, works in 
conjunction with Grameen Bank 
to give rural farmers, herders, 
and fishermen microloans in the 
form of cell phones. The phones

Students present work on energy issues, virtual worlds
Virtual showcase to take place
On Wednesday, the students of this 
semesters Building Virtual Worlds 
class will showcase their work in a 
colorful on-stage show in McConomy 
Auditorium. The show will display the 
best work that the students developed 
over the course of the semester in a 
mix of performance art, video games, 
computer animation, and audience par
ticipation. Since its inception more than 
10 years ago, Building Virtual Worlds 
has become a university tradition.
Building Virtual Worlds isnt a typical 
lecture course  its an interdisciplin
ary project course housed in Carnegie 
Mellons Entertainment Technology 
Center that brings together students 
from computer science, drama, engi
neering, art, and other disciplines to 
combine their talents to develop inter
active virtual environments. The ETC 
was created in fall 1998 as a joint pro
gram between the School of Computer 
Science and the College of Fine Arts.
The class was developed more than 
a decade ago by computer science pro
fessor Randy Pausch. The course is 
now taught by assistant professor of 
entertainment technology Jesse Schell. 
Prior to joining the Carnegie Mellon 
faculty, Schell was the creative director 
of the Disney Virtual Reality Studio. He 
is also the CEO of Schell Games, an in
dependent game studio in Pittsburgh.
Students in the course use ETC plat
forms, such as the Jam-O-Drum (a 
multiplayer audiovisual game device), 
Quasi the robot (the first robot created 
by Carnegie Mellons Interbots initia
tive in 2004), and the Panda3D engine 
to view the virtual worlds. Other tools 
include Maya, Photoshop, Adobe 
Audition, and Pro Tools.
The event begins at 6 p.m.
Students win letter-writing contest
Four Carnegie Mellon graduate en
gineering students won first place in a 
prestigious competition in which they 
teamed up to write letters to presi
dential candidates demonstrating their 
awareness of current environmental 
issues by asking the candidates to elab
orate on their own positions regarding 
energy and sustainability.
The students were Shahzeen Attari, 
a Ph.D. candidate in engineering and 
public policy and civil and environmen
tal engineering; Ines Margarida Lima de 
Azevedo, a Ph.D. candidate in engineer
ing and public policy; Benjamin Flath, a 
masters student in civil and environ
mental engineering; and Constantine 
Samaras, a Ph.D. candidate in engi
neering and public policy and civil and 
environmental engineering.
The contest, Tomorrows Energy 
Ambassadors, Managers and Scholars
(TEAMS), was sponsored by Johnson 
Controls, Inc., a company that works to 
create smart environments. The letter 
appeared as a full-page advertisement 
in the Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. 
regional editions of USA Today on Nov. 
20. The students also received $10,000 
for Carnegie Mellons scholarship fund 
and a $2500 grant, both from Johnson 
Controls.
Johnson Controls invited students 
at over 200 member schools of the 
Association for the Advancement of 
Sustainability in Higher Education to 
participate in the challenge. Students 
were judged on their awareness of 
energy and sustainability issues and 
creativity and originality of the call to

THE TARTAN  DECEMBER 3, 2007
Student Senate changes its face with new members
SENATE, from A1
academic affairs, which concerns 
the creation of new programs 
and improvement of the library; 
and business affairs, which deals 
with all monetary transactions 
that students make.
However, despite its recent 
success, members of the student 
body are still not sure what ex
actly Student Senate does.
I had no idea that all of the
 .4
seats were filled recently In fact, 
I do not know much about the 
workings of the Senate, said Rajeev Krithivasan, a first-year elec
trical and computer engineering 
major.
Itkowitz is aware of this prob
lem.
This year we are trying to 
increase transparency in the 
Senate. In fact, [Student Body 
Vice President] Adi Jain and I 
have just set up a Student Gov
ernment Visibility Committee, 
Itkowitz said.
Jain, a senior electrical and 
computer engineering and busi
ness administration major, has 
high hopes for the committee.
This committee will over
see an overhaul in publicity, an 
increase in student communica
tion, and we will make a better 
attempt to be seen at the events 
that we organize, Jain said.
We want to represent each
.1
and every student as well as pos
sible, and for this there needs 
to be better communication, 
Itkowitz said.
All students are encouraged 
to let their senators know of any 
concerns or suggestions that they 
might have.
If more students are involved, 
better things will get done fast
er, Itkowitz said.
Jain and Student Body 
President Sean Weinstock have
made a commitment to increas
ing communication between 
students and the Senate in their 
CMU 5 plan.
Jain encourages more students 
to come forward with their sug
gestions for improvement.
In addition to opening the 
lines of communication, Itkow
itz and Jain are also looking for 
ways to increase Student Senate 
visibility on campus.
Student government wants
people to want to be on the Sen
ate instead of simply attend meet
ings, Itkowitz said. And thats 
why we are asking our senators 
to be more visible to the student 
population.
Itkowitz is optimistic about 
the continued success of Student 
Senate.
With the Senate environment 
changing, the signs for the future 
are really encouraging, Itkowitz 
said.
Mock trial looks 
toward regionals
Sullivan speaks on Information Age
TRIAL, from A1
ities of the team can be easily 
misunderstood.
I didnt know the mock 
trial team had such awesome 
cases, said Lauren Taglieri, a 
sophomore information systems 
major. I thought a lot of mock 
trial was wearing suits and look
ing up laws, not as creative and 
interesting as it seems to be.
The cases alternate each year 
between civil and criminal.
This years case is that of a 
defendant stabbing his social 
worker and infecting her with 
AIDS. The defendant has plead 
guilty; now, the teams job is to 
argue for the strictest or most 
lenient punishment, depending 
on whether it is assigned to the 
defense or prosecution.
We dont know what side we 
have to argue until right before 
the competition round, so we 
have to be prepared for either 
side with all our witnesses and 
lawyers, said Akshaya Jha, a 
junior economics and statistics 
double major and mock trial 
treasurer.
Carnegie Mellons mock trial 
team consists of two sub-teams, 
each composed of nine students. 
These teams each compete in 
one round of competition on 
both of the days of a two-day 
competition.
Some years, we have intense 
inner-team rivalry, but this year 
we all seem to work together re
ally well, Durvasula said.
At last years invitational, two 
of the teams lawyers took home 
awards for outstanding perfor
mance.
However, for the Carnegie 
Mellon team, some of the most 
memorable moments are not 
just victories.
My favorite times are when 
a witness says something com
pletely wrong that just ends in 
a lawyers ridiculous questions 
that have nothing to do with the 
case, Jha said.
Everyone always tries to act 
professional, he added, even 
if he or she trips while walking 
away or is unable to hold in his 
or her laughter.
The idea is not supposed 
to be simulating of an actual
court case, Durvasula said. 
Our cases are memorized, so 
its really about one-third legal 
knowledge, one-third acting, 
and one-third presentation.
The competitions are held in 
classrooms and there is no actu
al gavel for the judge, Durvasula 
added.
However, the intensity of 
mock trial competitions is no 
laughing matter.
There are a number of strict 
rules that must be followed in 
the classroom.
Something as small as a piece 
of paper on a desk could make 
a team lose points, as written 
notes and aids are strictly forbid
den  memorization is the only 
option.
In addition to dressing the 
part, witnesses, lawyers, and 
defendants must follow the 
guidelines of when to stand, sit, 
and speak in the course of the 
trial.
While strict, Jha and Durvasula said the restrictions are well 
worth it.

Israel and Palestine discuss peace
PEACE, from A1
mit in the first place.
The potential impact of a 
fruitless meeting had serious 
consequences for both sides.
Some Israeli experts predicted 
that Hamas, the Palestinian po
litical and military organization 
currently in control of Gaza, 
might attempt to produce unrest 
in the wake of the meeting that 
could snowball into a possible 
third intifada.
While Israeli and Palestinian 
officials (from Fatah, the ruling 
party of the West Bank) had been 
working on developing a joint 
statement to make at the sum
mit, no such document had been 
produced by the day before the 
conference was scheduled to be 
held.
When President Bush rose to 
the podium to greet his guests 
at the conference on Tuesday,
however, he did so with a joint 
statement signed by Israeli Prime 
Minister Ehud Olmert and Pal
estinian President Mahmoud 
Abbas.
In the statement, both lead
ers pledged to begin final-status 
peace talks next month, through 
bi-weekly meetings, with the 
plan to reach an agreement by 
the end of 2008.
Both leaders also pledged 
to fulfill those requirements 
dictated by President Bushs 
roadmap, as reported by 
haaretz.com, for peace in the 
region; for the Palestinians, that 
means denouncing and fighting 
terrorism, and for Israelis, halt
ing illegal construction of Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank.
Calling the meeting a hopeful 
. beginning, according to haaretz. 
com, both Bush and U.S. Secre
tary of State Condoleezza Rice 
affirmed that no one could afford
to allow these discussions to fail.
On campus, the events of last 
week were put in historical per
spective by the Hillel Jewish 
University Center, which painted 
the fence in Israeli colors to com
memorate the 60th anniversary 
of the Partition Plan.
Carnegie Mellon students 
weighed in with their opinions 
on the conference.
Sophomore Daniel Liptz, a 
mechanical engineering major 
and board member of Tartans for 
Israel, expressed cautious hope
fulness -about the conference at 
Annapolis.
Im optimistic, Liptz said, 
I dont anticipate any huge 
steps at first, but Olmerts and 
[Abbass] approval ratings 
are fairly low right now. They 
really need to accomplish some
thing substantial if they want to 
regain the confidence of their 
constituents.
Other students questioned the 
motives for the meeting in the 
first place.
Im afraid the whole summit 
may be too unilaterally driven on 
the part of the United States for 
anything significant to get done 
by Palestinians and Israelis, said 
junior psychology major Elliot 
Onn.
Yousef stressed that progress in 
the peace negotiations is particu
larly important for Palestinians.
Palestinians must agree 
among each other, Yousef said. 
Hamas cannot be disregard
ed in any peace negotiations, 
especially since they were demo
cratically elected. There must be 
efforts to unify the Palestinian 
government.

University project redefines books
BOOKS, from A1
barrier against the Million Book 
Project, have contributed to this 
disparity.
Copyrights stay in effect for 
varying lengths of time in dif
ferent countries, and because of 
Chinas long history, the project 
has significantly more Chinese 
works that are exempt from copy
right protection.
Compared to those in Chinese, 
there are far fewe books in English 
available due to tighter copyright 
constraints. About half of the cur
rent collection remains under 
copyright. The recent addition of 
Egypts Bibliotheca Alexandrina 
may help even the distribution. 
Project directors hope that digi
tization of volumes in Alexandria
Library, which has suffered de
struction several times over the 
course of its history, would make 
them immortal to further harm.
Current goals over the next 
year, according to the archive 
website, include restructuring 
the hosting solution for scanned 
volumes.
The new plan is to have every 
country host the material it scans, 
while storing metadata of au
thors, publishers, and publishing 
dates in one centralized server for 
easier searching. However, the 
press release states that most of 
the work will focus on correcting 
inaccuracies and non-standard 
cataloging practices.

by over 7000 volumes per day.

The ability to view weather

where decisions about irrigation 
can mean the difference between 
a thriving or a dying harvest.
Cell phones given through 
GrameenPhone have also en
abled mobile banking, giving
people who do not access to

In his lecture, Sullivan stated 
that GrameenPhones innova

Norlntels partnership with 
GrameenPhone has been nothing 
but beneficial. GrameenPhone is 
now the companys most profit
able investment, proving to other 
companies and stockholders that 
humanitarian corporate citizenship can be lucrative as well as 
philanthropic.
Sullivan believes that in the 
future, the role of entrepreneurs 
is crucial to solving poverty on a 
global scale.
Weve seen that governments 
cant do this  or arent going

Sullivan believes that native 
entrepreneurs, armed with an 
understanding of local culture 
and infrastructure and backed 
by international funding, can 
change the course of big busi
ness by changing how the less

Connections 
found in brain
by Lowell Labaro
Stajfwriter
Carnegie Mellon University 
neuroscientist Marcel Just and 
Stanford postdoctoral fellow 
Sashank Varma have proposed 
new principles that explain how 
the human brain operates when 
performing complex cognitive 
tasks, such as language compre
hension and spatial reasoning.
Within the field of cognitive 
science, the accepted belief is 
that there exists a one-to-one 
mapping between particular 
high-level cognitive processes 
and the activation of a single cor
tical area. That is, each area of a 
persons brain is responsible for a 
particular cognitive task.
According to Just and Varmas 
publication in Cognitive, Affective
& Behavioral Neuroscience, this 
interpretation is incorrect and 
a gross oversimplification of a 
more complex ... many-to-many 
mapping, governed by more sub
tle organizational principles.
Just and Varma propose that 
the many-to-many mapping in
volves several cortical areas that 
are responsible for several cogni
tive activities.
The two researchers have de
veloped a computational theory 
of the brain called Capacity 
Constrained Concurrent Corti
cal Activation-based Production 
System (4CAPS). This theory is 
specifically used to model brain 
activities of language compre
hension, problem solving, spatial 
reasoning, and dual-tasking.
The 4CAPS theory provides a 
unique architecture of the brain 
in that it is the first model that il
lustrates resource utilization in 
brain areas that are consistent 
with fMRI images.
By adjusting capacity con
straints, 4GAPS can be used 
to model brains that are under 
certain adverse conditions. For 
instance, researchers can model

How Things Work: Hot Air Balloons
Marium Chandna
Hot air balloons seem 
ever-ready to take to the skies, 
standing firm and upright, bob
bing in the fresh air.
After reviewing the weather 
forecast, the pilot marks a wide, 
open space  free from any 
trees, poles, or power cables  
as the take-off point. Reassured 
by the clear sky and mild breeze, 
the pilot slips on flame resistant 
gloves and climbs into the bowl
shaped wicker basket.
The basket is still attached 
to the ground crew vehicle, so 
it does not elope with the wind 
before the passengers climb 
aboard.
The average-sized hot air bal
loon is filled with 105,000 cubic 
feet of hot air and can carry four 
passengers. However, if hot air 
balloons were equipped with a 
larger wicker basket, they could 
carry up to 16 passengers.
Besides the scientific fact 
that hot air rises amid cool 
air, a passengers balloon
ing journey depends on three 
structural components: the
balloon envelope, burner, and 
wicker basket.
The balloon envelope is the 
inflated structure (shaped like 
an upside-down dome) that 
stores hot air. The envelope 
of this balloon is made out of 
a ripstop nylon fabric with in
tegrated, flame-resistant Nomex technology. Therefore, it 
is not only strong, lightweight, 
and waterproof, but it is also 
fireproof.
Because of the close proxim
ity of the balloon envelope to 
the burner, it is crucial for the 
envelope to be fireproof. The 
burner sets ablaze propane, 
which is a liquefied, high-energy 
gas, heating up the air enclosed 
inside the balloon. In turn, this 
heating process helps the bal
loon rise higher up in the sky.
The propane in the hot air 
balloon comes from one of the 
central components of the bal
loon  the wicker basket. The 
wicker basket not only carries
As the envelope of a hot air balloon heats up from the pilot flame, the hot air balloon rises in the sky. 
passengers, but also contains 
some of the most essential 
equipment required for hot air 
ballooning, including naviga
tional tools and two narrow 
cylinders that serve as propane 
tanks.
These propane tanks contain 
extremely dense propane and 
are attached at the top to an in
take hose which leads down to 
the hose of the cylinder in order 
to extract the propane.
Once the ground crewreleases 
the balloon from the ground, it 
is the pilots job to actually get 
the balloon off the ground.
The pilot turns a lever that
unbolts the propane valve and 
boosts the flow of gas through, 
the hose. This process starts the 
burner, causing the propane to 
flow out of the hose and catch 
fire on a small, natural gas flame 
known as the pilot light.
Due to the increased density 
of the propane (it is reduced in 
volume by the pressure in the 
cylinders), it flows smoothly  
though rapidly  through the 
hose and reaches the heating 
coil. The heating coil, which is 
a narrow section of steel tubing, 
is placed in a spiral around the 
burner and heats up as the pilot 
light glows.
As the heating coil grows hot, 
it warms up the propane that 
flows through it, thus trans
forming it into a gas before it 
comes in contact with the pi
lot light. This process sparks 
a mightier flame and provides 
increased efficiency in terms of 
fuel consumption.
In summary, when the amount 
of gas that flows through the 
hose increases, the flame be
comes larger, and the air inside 
the envelope heats up faster. By 
doing this, the pilot bolsters the 
vertical speed of the balloon.
As the flame intensifies, the 
balloon rises at an increasing
rate. To slow the ascent of the 
balloon, the pilot must open the 
parachute valve at the top of the 
envelope. The parachute valve 
is basically an opening that al
lows hot air to escape. In order 
to open it, the pilot pulls a cord 
that extends from the top of the 
balloon all the way down to the 
basket.
The opening of the para
chute valve allows some of .the 
trapped heat to escape into the 
atmosphere, causing the air 
temperature inside the enve
lope to fall.
Since the temperature out
side the envelope and the tem
perature inside the envelope 
are now equal, the ascent of the 
balloon slows. If the pilot leaves 
the valve open for a long period 
of time, the balloon begins to 
descend.
Other than ascending and 
descending, the pilot does not 
have much control over the di
rection that the balloon takes. 
Nevertheless, while the wind is 
largely responsible for maneu
vering the hot air balloon, the 
pilot can move the hot air bal
loon horizontally, to the right or 
left, at desired speed by adjust
ing the vertical position of the 
balloon.
The key here is the altitude 
of the balloon. Wind blows at 
different speeds and in differ
ent directions at different lev
els of height. Conventionally, 
wind speed increases as the 
balloon drifts higher into the 
atmosphere.
As the balloon descends, the 
pilot spots the ground crew in 
the distance, waiting down be
low to provide support in the 
case that the wicker basket tips 
upon landing. Unlike a plane 
or helicopter, the wicker bas
ket does not have any wheels 
or landing skids. Also, the pilot 
lands in an area enclosed by a 
number of trees, which blocks 
much of the wind and makes the 
landing much smoother.
Hot air ballooning is a vivid 
demonstration of principles in 
physics and how natures move
ment allows people to travel.

AmericanCancer
CyLab faculty deciphers ancient gravestone writing
Theory describes brain interactivity
BRAIN, from A4
an autistic brain by decreasing 
the capacity of bandwidth re
sources that can be consumed for 
each task.
4CAPS is an attempt to take 
seriously the fact that brain 
function, and thus cognition, 
is constrained by resource limi
tations, said Varma. The goal 
is to see how much of the brain 
functions can be understood as 
a consequence of minimizing re
source consumption.
Although there is functional 
redundancy across cortical areas 
in the brain, there is typically one 
area in the brain that is most ef
ficient at a particular task.
For example, Brocas area, a re
gion on the left side of the brain, 
is most efficient at syntactic 
analysis. However, if this area is 
somehow damaged or if the task 
of syntactic analysis becomes too 
complex, homologous areas in the 
right brain become more active.
In a Carnegie Mellon press 
release, Just likened the brains 
behavior to that of a sports team. 
In other words, if a forward or 
quarterback is somehow injured 
or overworked, there is a ready 
albeit less capable  replacement 
ready to join the fray. In the same
way, if an area of the brain mal
functions, the brain has backup 
regions to perform the necessary 
function.
In their computational theory 
of the brain, Just and Varma 
also explain the limits of cortical 
areas. Just said that the human 
brain is a biological thinking 
machine with a finite capacity of 
resources.
These finite resources may 
explain the slow and degraded 
performance of more compli
cated tasks, such as processing 
statements with a relatively more 
complex syntactic structure.
Oxygen and glucose are, after 
all, scarce resources in the body, 
said Varma, although the rela
tionship between quantity and 
complexity of a cognitive task and 
the resources it consumes has yet 
to be explored.
In their paper, Just and Varma 
further state that the topology 
of a large-scale cortical network 
changes dynamically during 
cognition. This claim rejects the 
possibility that there is a preor
dained set of cortical areas that 
perform a task.
In fact, there is evidence from 
Just and Varmas research that 
the set of cortical areas involved 
in a cognitive task changes from
trial to trial and moment to mo
ment within a single trial.
The most novel of Just and 
Varmas proposals is that the 
communication infrastructure 
that supports collaborative pro
cessing is also subject to resource 
constraints.
In other words, Just and 
Varmas research indicates that 
the brains constraint on band
width limits the communication 
between and among activated 
areas. The difficulty of multitask
ing might be the result of these 
limitations. This conclusion has 
been drawn through experiments 
involving driving a car coupled 
with the task of listening.
In these experiments, Just ob
served that the regions actively 
engaged in driving would reduce 
in activity by 40 percent as soon 
as the task of listening was intro
duced into the trial.
The importance of Just and 
Varmas research is in the novel 
idea that thinking is performed 
by a cooperative group of corti
cal networks that are limited by 
resource capacities, but these 
networks can dynamically adapt 
to changing demands in cognitive 
activity.
According to Just, All of hu
manity is brain activity.
SCAN, from A4
technology studies the 3D surface of 
objects and is not limited to rock art or 
carvings on gravestones. It can be ap
plied to different types of medical analy
sis, geographical intelligence, and the 
reconstruction of geographical sites.
By compiling the scanned data, Cai 
has also developed a digital cemetery for 
Old St. Lukes Church, which is basically 
a virtual tour of the cemetery.
To view the different gravestones in 
the cemetery, all one needs is access to 
a computer. The program can be used on 
any computer, and will soon be available 
online and on DVD.
Cai and his team have not only ad
opted a new approach to recording and 
digitizing the information on the weath
er-beaten gravestones, but they have
also gone one step ahead in reconstruct
ing this data.
Reconstruction is the key when you 
want to actually read the words once you 
have recorded them, Cai said.
Once the high-resolution scanning 
system has captured the details on the 
gravestone, it uses two functions to re
construct the image: digital lighting and 
filtering. The special filter marks out 
the curved and linear features on the 
surface.
The specialized software used for this 
research strips the image of any color 
illusion to promote clarity and improve 
the overall quality of the image, thus 
making it look more real.
According to Pavlyshak, surface points 
are then located on the image using la
ser technology. Surface points are data 
points with given ordinates. Various
mathematical algorithms are applied to 
these surface points in order to shade the 
stone carvings for visibility.
Pavlyshak said, The software uses 
a combination of surface signatures  
positive signatures and negative sig
natures  to locate the surface points 
and interpret the carvings on the stone 
surface.
This scanning system also blocks out 
any sun reflection, thus keeping the im
age free from any obscurity.
Cai said, The system is simple, totally 
flexible, and affordable, besides being 
a solid technique to solve this practical 
problem of not being able to read the in
scribed information on the gravestone. 
Prior to this method, the writings on the 
grave [stones] were not legible at all.
For example, one of the gravestones 
examined by Cai and his team, which
was not readable prior to Cais investi
gation, actually read, Esabella, wife of 
John Seville, born in London, 1781, died 
February 22,1862.
According to Cai, this technology can 
also be applied to enhance accuracy of 
tests in the medical field, such as tongue 
surface inspection.
In an interview with an Australian ra
dio channel, Cai stated, Tongue surface 
has a lot of rich features connected to the 
internal digestive systems, such as the 
stomach and microcirculatory systems. 
According to Cai, certain health im
balances can be detected by inspecting 
the tongues surface.
He stated, For example, the color and 
contour of the tongue surface changes 
when we are dehydrated or have a fever. 
We need a 3-D model of the tongue, be
cause a better and accurate analysis of
the color and texture depend on the 3-D 
model.
Cais latest technology has impacted 
different groups interested in unearth
ing and rediscovering the past.
From genealogy researchers to ar
chaeologists interested in deciphering 
the paroles on tombstones of the Roman 
army, a wide range of investigators from 
all over the world have approached Cai 
to share his knowledge and expertise.
Cai also provided some insight into his 
upcoming project.
There is a 500-year-old Indian Gods 
rock structure in Pennsylvania, near 
Pittsburgh. We want to scan it and build 
a digital site of it, said Cai.

Get your caffeine fix  at McDonalds
For those of us sick of paying $3.50 
for a latte, hope may be right around the 
corner, across the street, and in plenty of 
other convenient locations. The ubiqui
tous burger-and-fries chain McDonalds 
is expanding its fast food repertoire to 
include lattes, cappuccinos, and other 
specialty coffee beverages, potentially 
putting a run on Starbucks.
Call us caffeinated, but were excited 
to see McDonalds emerging as a com
petitor to the Starbucks behemoth. The 
rivalry should be good for both compa
nies, encouraging McDonalds to soften 
its atmosphere and Starbucks to lower 
its prices.
McDonalds coffee has been selling 
well since the company switched to pre
mium blend in 2006, a fact confirmed 
by the success of iced coffee, one of the
newest menu options. To the average 
consumer palate, McDonalds coffee 
tastes just as good as Starbucks coffee; 
its also cheaper and faster.
The new specialty drinks are likely 
to fare just as well. According to a Wall 
Street Journal article published March 
1, McDonalds has already begun selling 
lattes at restaurants in Europe, along 
with locations in select U.S. states, in
cluding New York and New Jersey. The 
lattes sell for between $2 and $3. Mean
while, Starbucks lattes cost over $3, and 
the company has increased its prices 
twice this year.
McDonalds specialty beverages 
should help customers save time as 
well as money; the chain uses push
button machines to brew the drink  
considerably faster than the baristas at
Starbucks.
That being said, the McDonalds/Star
bucks battle is not one-sided. To retaliate 
against McDonalds premium coffee, 
Starbucks started selling breakfast sand
wiches, a calculated strike against the 
formers much-loved breakfast menu. 
Over the years, the company has inflated 
its domain to include everything from 
non-breakfast sandwiches to satellite 
radio; even company Chairman How
ard Schultz admitted that such efforts 
contributed to a watering down of the 
Starbucks experience in a Nov. 6 article 
in the Journal. We like coffeehouses the 
way we like our coffee  not watereddown. Starbucks needs to get its act 
together and remain coffee-centric.
As for McDonalds, keep up the good 
work.
Library Project saves out-of-print books
In the past weeks the technology world 
has been focused on digital books. Ama
zons Kindle, a hand-held e-book reader 
that comes with a service for download
ing books and newspapers, was released 
to a frenzied media. Just over a week 
later Carnegie Mellon announced that 
its Universal Digital Library Project has 
now surpassed 1.5 million books.
While we know trying to stop 
technology is frequently a futile task, 
were still wary of plans that separate 
words from paper. While the conve
nience of being able to have any book 
nearly instantly or bringing ones entire 
library in the portable size of a single 
book on vacation is appealing, there are 
some chilling realities that sound more 
like details in a dystopian future.
For example, from a design perspec
tive, the Kindle has only one typeface, 
which means every book will look the 
same, a uniformity impossible to find 
in a physical library. Also according to 
the Kindle Terms of Service, Amazon 
can track which books you have read, 
including how long you read them, what 
page you leave off on, and if you make 
any notes or markings in your digital 
volumes. Most disturbing, however, is 
that as the device is always passively 
connected, nothing stops Amazon from 
updating the content of your book. From 
a typo or a poorly worded sentence to 
the removal or addition of whole chap
ters and characters, they can rewrite 
your favorite novel without limitations.
The Universal Digital Library Project, 
led by Carnegie Mellon, holds the better 
position on the topic of archival honesty.
Its mission statement involves providing 
free access to all of human knowledge 
and protecting the integrity and avail
ability of the data. While many of the 
books they scan are under copyright and 
cannot currently be viewed online, their 
sights are certainly set for the long term. 
Yet even as this is presently the best way 
to form a repository of human literature, 
we question what is lost as we digitize 
all of the worlds books. However, once 
books go out of print, they seem to disap
pear. The benefit of the Universal Digital 
Library Project is that it preserves these 
books in an online format.
So as the bibliophiles we are, we plan 
to keep acquiring books in their present 
form for as long as we can and revelling 
when we find any typo, an unchange
able reminder of humanity in print.
Print media readership increases under CRP
Though many have suggested that the 
availability of free news on the web has 
made print media a tired anachronism, 
the demand for printed newspapers on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus suggests 
that printed and online news are not 
necessarily substitutes for one another. 
Supplying this demand by providing 
paper copies of newspapers on campus 
is the frequently taken-for-granted Col
legiate Readership Program.
The Collegiate Readership Program 
(CRP), sponsored by Student Senate 
and paid for a by a small fee built into 
tuition, has kept printed papers free and 
accessible on campus (in the red boxes, 
like in the UC). Though in the past there
has been some controversy over the ef
fectiveness of the program, recent data 
suggests that print paper readership is 
up. USA Today, featured alongside The 
New York Times and the Pittsburgh PostGazette, has had to increase its circula
tion in the paper dispensers by the thou
sands over the past year to keep up with 
demand under the CRP.
Student Senates sponsorship of the 
CRP has, in addition to meeting student 
and faculty demand for papers, also af
forded Carnegie Mellon the opportunity 
to host a number of lectures that are 
only available to schools with the CRP. 
For example, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of 
General Electric, will lecture on Dec.
10 and be interviewed by USA Today 
writers. Though the lecture is jointly 
sponsored by the Tepper School of Busi
ness, Student Senate, and USA Today, 
this schools CRP sponsorship was a key 
determinant in USA Today's decision to 
support the event.
The CRP is an excellent service from 
the Student Senate that is truly more 
than meets the eye. Not only does it pro
vide easy access to local, national, and 
international news to the work-crazed 
students at Carnegie Mellon, but the 
CRP gives the entire community the op
portunity to attend lectures by highly 
relevant speakers and engage in a con
versation on timely issues.
Timeless tunes complete the 
Christmas season
Justine Lee
Halloween and Thanksgiving arent 
real holidays. They only exist to make 
the time between summer and Christ
mas bearable. If it were up to me, in
stead of text, this article would be full 
of little sound bites you could just pick 
up and listen to. But because we arent 
quite there yet, I will have to rely on 
my words to express to you just how 
much I truly love Christmas music.
Theres family, the gift of giving, 
and hot cocoa. Theres gingerbread, 
the smell of pine, and snow. But what 
fuels me are the melodies. Enough to 
make radio stations give up their Top 10 
countdowns during the Christmas sea
son, there is nothing quite like the voice 
of Heaven itself, Nat King Cole, or the 
modern-day crooning of Michael Buble.
True, there are biblical songs, which 
I can appreciate. Its probably a good 
thing to remind us that before it was a 
holiday to decorate Douglas firs and pass 
around the eggnog, Christmas was a 
celebration of Jesus birth. And, frankly, 
tunes about the three wise men, the star 
of Bethlehem, and the virgin Mary and 
her child make for some catchy beats.
There are also seemingly nonsensical 
songs. How much fun was it to add like 
a lightbulb! to the end of the Rudolph 
song? Theres always a time and a place 
for the silly. (Although, whats endear
ing about listening to a whining little 
boy with a lisp sing about what he wants 
for Christmas? And Eartha Kitt, why 
do you, in Santa Baby, so seductively 
ask Santa to bring you a yacht, decora
tions from Tiffanys, and a ring? Sorry, 
Eartha, but thats really pushing it.)
Finally, there are instrumental songs.
When lyrics become superfluous, all 
I want to hear is a good symphonic 
piece. Remember how pumped up you 
were when little Kevin McCallister was 
streaming together his master plan of 
feathers, nails, and hot irons to the cre
scendos of Carol of the Bells?
But above all, there are the timeless 
songs. My favorite seasonal tunes are 
the swingy and upbeat ones that grew 
popular in the 30s, when the quality of 
a singers voice was not dependent upon 
the skills of music technicians, and they 
still dominate today. As part of the boy 
band generation, I can confidently say 
that the pop-tastic voices of *NSYNC 
could never bring the same amount of 
cheer as can the commanding, crisp, 
and charming voices of Frank Sinatra, 
Bing Crosby, and Andy Williams. More
over, while Mariah Careys vocal range 
is impressive, she cant match jazz leg
end Ella Fitzgerald.
Yet there is still some room for to
days artists. Sufjan Stevenss whisperyvoiced Christmas album is unique, with 
steady drumming, ringing bells, and 
strumming banjos. Michael Bubl has 
a more classic-sounding voice, compa
rable to but decidedly different from 
Sinatras. Ive admittedly fallen in love 
with his renditions of Ill Be Home For 
Christmas and Grown-up Christmas 
List.
So imagine shopping, ice-skating, or 
cupping your hands around a cup of hot 
cocoa without the familiar melodies and 
angelic voices of Christmas. It would be 
a lonely one indeed. There is no holiday 
season without its timeless music.

H&SS in professional writing and busi
ness administration. All she wants for 
Christmas is a pair of ear muffs and 
a round-trip ticket to anywhere in the 
world.
Student Senate: Get involved, eradicate bias
Kelly Duncan
This is the first time in recent history 
that all 38 seats of undergraduate 
Student Senate are full. The main dif
ference between todays Senate and 
past ones is that todays is over one-half 
Greek; students in fraternities and so
rorities fill 22 of 38 available seats.
A quick look at the history of Senate 
shows that until 2004, it consisted of 
few Greeks. Why the change?
In spring 2004, Greek Council re
ceived a significant drop in funding for 
events like Greek Week and Greek Sing 
during the Joint Funding Process. Dur
ing Senate elections later that spring, 
Greeks ran and won in larger numbers 
than ever before. Theres since been 
a steady increase of the percentage of 
Greeks in Senate. This means theres 
been a decrease in the array of people 
representing the rest of campus (Greeks 
make up under 20 percent of under
graduates but 58 percent of Senate; 
hence, the other 80 percent of campus 
is losing some type of representation).
Many old strongholds of Senate are 
losing ground (today there are no rep
resentatives from KGB, which used to 
have a plurality of members), and some 
groups feel that because of the current 
make-up, they are losing influence on 
campus. At the last Senate meeting, 
there was a consensus between a few 
senators, many of them Greek, that 
there was a bias toward a particular 
funding motion because the person 
presenting the request was a fraternity 
brother of many senators. Luckily, there 
doesnt seem to be an open bias against
groups that are mainly non-Greek, such 
as Activities Board and cmuTV, which 
still received funding at the amounts 
requested. These groups do seem timid, 
though, in asking for money from Sen
ate for large funding proposals, while 
Greek-backed groups continue to confi
dently present proposals to the Senate.
With rumors of bias emerging, the 
question every student must ask is: How 
could the Senate be more open to the 
campus community? The bigger prob
lem at hand is that not every student 
thinks about this issue due to the over
whelming apathy toward the Senate on 
our campus, a problem I have tried to 
tackle since my freshman year.
However, some are getting involved: 
At the last meeting, one Greek sena
tor talked about why she got involved 
in student government  because an
other Greek told her, Senate is a good 
thing to do. This concept makes sense; 
why do people join fraternities, sorori
ties, student groups, or anything else? 
People get involved in activities largely 
by word of mouth: all of their friends 
are doing it, telling them how great it is, 
and that they should do it too.
Next time you see a friend who only 
plays computer games or watches TV 
all day, tell them to get involved in 
anything that this campus has to offer, 
whether it be a student group, research 
inside an academic department, Greek 
life, or even Senate. Until everyone is 
involved, there will always be a bias of 
some sort in Student Senate.
Kelly Duncan (kduncan@J welcomes 
comments from anyone not too apathetic 
to write to her.

THE TARTAN  DECEMBER 3, 2007
Presidential
Perspectives
Legislatures 
wrap up 
successful year
Sean WeinsVck & Adi Jain
Hello Tartans. This week, there 
was not much official business 
because everyone is busy wrap
ping up the academic semester.
Nevertheless, Adi and I came 
into this school year with 
great ambition. We saw a lot of 
potential for improvement, and 
I feel like we have really started 
to run with our platform of 
practical change. This, of course, 
is in large part due to the sup
port and work weve witnessed 
from the entire campus commu
nity. It is very apparent to us that 
everyone wants to create better 
systems on campus. Whatever 
the cause  elections or institu
tional memory, alumni relations, 
or school fundraising  tremen
dous progress has been made.
One area in particular that I 
would like to call attention to is 
the staggering success of our stu
dent legislatures. Thanks in no 
small part to Chair Jared Itkowitz 
and his seasoned Executive 
Board, Student Senate curerntly 
has its first full roster in three 
years. Despite the tremendous 
delay in election ratification, 
Senate has done a wonderful 
job reaching out to campus and 
making itself known, hearing the 
different perspectives brought 
forth by different administra
tors and students on issues that 
are relevant to all our everyday 
lives, and creating an overall at
mosphere of hope and potential 
that our peer institutions can be 
envious of.
The Graduate Student Assem
bly, led brilliantly for the past 
year by President Beth Ayers and 
her board, has also done a great 
job in petitioning local, state, 
and national governments for 
improvements in services offered 
to students. This has created a 
great social environment in an 
incredibly academically rigorous 
institution, and has helped me 
transition smoothly into the role 
of president by listening to and 
supporting the necessary change 
Adi and I have begun to and will 
continue to invoke.
I hope that all the terrific work 
we have seen this semester is not 
soon forgotten. I hope that we as 
a student body are able to push 
forward throughout the upcom
ing semester to lay the roots for 
a Carnegie Mellon that not only 
becomes a top-10 ranked univer
sity, but has an environment that 
is conducive to life, exploration 
not only through academics but 
also via social avenues, and in
dividual achievement in every 
manner.
Thank you to all for a fantastic 
start to the year. Hopefully, your 
finals go well, and you are able to 
achieve at levels on par with your 
goals. Next semester, we go even 
bigger.
As always, cmu5@cmu.edu.
Finals might be the only thing on your mind, but dont forget  the holidays are just around the corner! So we asked,

Presidential candidates send messages through campaign signs
Cynthia Peng
A presidential candidates 
campaign logo may not reveal 
their upbringing, education, 
stances on issues, or what number 
spouse theyre on, but they do 
offer a glimpse into their artistic 
and propagandist^ portrayal of 
themselves. How do they want 
to be seen on someones back 
bumper or front yard? Is a bold 
Arial typeface more effective 
than a proper-looking Times New 
Roman? How can one distort 
familiar patriotic symbols in a 
splattering convulsion of red, 
white, and blue while integrating 
them with the carefully selected 
typeface, which then must work 
with the logo as a whole, while 
also reflecting the candidate as a 
person, while sending subliminal 
messages to the voter  all while 
keeping with the American stan
dard of looking good while doing 
it?
Its a lot-to think about, and 
the 2008 candidates offer a 
delectable selection of logos to 
overanalyze.
Lets focus on the all-important
campaign sign theme by theme.
First and foremost, lets look 
at how the candidates names 
are presented on their signs. The 
name certainly matters. It breaks 
it down into nice, simple terms 
for the average American voter, 
who collectively vote more often 
for their favorites on American 
Idol than the presidency, and 
who collectively are more likely 
to know their NFL teams run
ning back than their senator. The 
name on the sign tells you whos 
running, and hopefully convinces 
you, come November 2008 when 
youre standing in the voting 
booth, to pick the correspond
ing candidate whose catchy name 
covers the lawn of signs in that 
one politically charged neighbors 
front yard.
Hillary Clinton has to win this 
one. Her name makes it seem like 
shes inviting you in for tea  her 
typeface tells you you are on a 
first name basis with her. The 
typeface is bold, yet sophisticated. 
If you go for tea at Hillarys place, 
youll expect bold and sophisti
cated tea. And according to The 
New York Timess Ward Sutton in 
the recent article Reading Tea 
Leaves and Campaign Logos, the 
i and ls all look like the num
ber one. Its as though, amid your 
biscotti and lemon crackers, she 
somehow works in that shes on 
top  always was, always will be. 
Youll walk away remembering 
her not as a member of the 
Clinton dynasty, not the wronged 
wife during the Lewinsky inci
dent, and not even former first 
lady. You remember Hillary.
Lets move onto candidates 
use of well-known patriotic 
symbols, those high emblems of 
American values. The generally 
accepted purpose of this artistic 
embellishment is for you, the 
voter, to naturally associate the 
candidate with a patriotic symbol 
in a fuzzy glow of America-love.
Mitt Romney seems to do this 
well. Mitt, in an attempt to pres
ent his Michigan-cultivated, 
hard-working Mormon back
ground to the general voting 
public in an accessible way, 
incorporates what looks like an 
eagle in flight above his name. 
The head and beak are eas
ily discernible, and the spirited 
red stripes following it suggest 
motion. Does it imply that a 
Romney administration will set 
the country in motion? According 
to Sutton, its ambiguous. The 
eagle/banner/object/whatever
is more like a mash up of the 
logo for the New England Patriots 
and... the Post Office?
I suppose this is a step in the 
right direction if were going 
for accessibility in a candi
date. Americans love football! 
Americans love the Post Office! 
Mitts got the football vote and the 
postal workers vote! Well, unless 
you are a Colts fan. Based on this 
theory, Mitt is semi-consciously 
repulsing the good people of 
Indianapolis.
Sometimes, symbols can 
oh-so-subtly suggest a can
didates views. Take John 
Edwardss shooting star: a radical 
departure from the expected 
visual conglomerate of red, 
white and blue, Edwards star 
has a tail of... green! Edwardss 
green practices and passion for 
environmental conservation 
have won him the hearts of the 
Sierra Club, Audubon Society, 
and so on and so forth. But is it 
reminiscent of the 2000 GoreLieberman campaign, which had 
a similar shooting star, and where 
parodies of signs proclaiming 
Sore-Loserman were abun
dant? Foreshadowing eight years 
later, perhaps the promising little 
star of hope, the shooting star
leaving behind a legacy of envi
ronmentalism, whatever our 
friends John, Al, and Joe were 
shooting for  pun intended
 will unfortunately be lost in 
a big black hole, a venomous 
entity of dead-star oblivion.
Lastly, Barack Obama would 
like you to see his sign as an 
emotionally impactful whole. 
He achieves this in a variety of 
ways. First, note his one-name 
correspondence. Hes not serv
ing you tea like Hillary; hes 
Obama  hes assertive and 
putting his foot down. Note the 
o vowel sound interspersed 
throughout. Obama 08. The 
open-to-interpretation O sun
rise logo. Playing off of such 
a basic human sound, Obama 
manages to reach a variety of 
groups: the Oooohhhhhhhchanting football fans Mitt 
would be clamoring to have, to 
the oooohhhs in hymns sung 
by church congregations, to the 
lightbulb in the pondering vot
ers head going off: Oh! I think 
Ill vote for Obama! And how 
effective would that be?

unopened, though I dont think 
theres anything wrong with giv
ing presents in general.
I dont have patience, either, 
for people who get offended 
by someones cheerful Merry 
Christmas, Christmas deco
rations funded by taxpayers, 
Christmas craft activities in 
school, or the fact that the 
menorah on the White House 
lawn is slightly smaller than the 
Christmas tree. Get over your
selves already!
So this holiday season, I ask 
my fundamentalist friends on 
both sides of the spectrum to 
lighten up. If an atheist comes 
into your home on Christmas 
day and sets your tree on fire, or 
if the government decrees that 
Christmas can legally only be 
celebrated at Mac/s and not at 
church, then you can shriek that 
Christmas has been destroyed. 
And my fellow non-Christians, if 
its decreed that youre not enti
tled to either celebrate or take 
school or work off, then you can 
cry out to the skies that your hol
iday has been destroyed. Until 
then, shut your pie-holes!
As for the rest of you who 
think its okay for me to cel
ebrate Christmas, happy ChrisHanu-Kwan to you! I hope you 
have a really great holiday sea

Food and shopping.
Its tough being an agnostic 
during the holidays. I still have to 
buy or make presents for every
body on a graduate students 
budget while taking exams; I still 
have to be annoyed by Christmas 
music starting Nov. 1; and yet, I 
also have to deal with people telk 
ing me that, as a non-believer, I 
shouldnt celebrate Christmas;
What the hell? (Oh  sorry  
can I say hell if I dont believe 
in it, either?) Nobody would bar 
me from a Sunday service if I 
admitted my agnosticism  in 
fact, theyd probably be thrilled 
to get the chance to convert me. 
Does my celebration of Christmas 
destroy the holiday for Christians 
just like gay people getting 
hitched destroys marriage for 
straight people?
Or, does my secular celebration 
of Christmas contribute to the 
overall commercialization of 
Christmas that so disturbs peo
ple like Bill OReilly? To me, 
Christmas is about cookies, fam
ily, decorating trees, and giving 
presents. Yes, I spend some money 
for Christmas presents, but most
ly for raw materials  I make my 
presents every year, and I love 
doing it. I love decorating cook
ies, taking the decorations out of 
the attic, watching the Muppet 
version of A Christmas Carol, and 
caroling with my friends. Am I 
destroying Christmas?
If you believe so, fundamental
ists, then are you doing your part 
to preserve it by refraining from 
giving or receiving any presents 
this year? Or is it not the com
mercialism, but just my dirty, 
dirty heathen vibes? Ooo. Youre 
going to catch agnosticism just by 
reading this.
Then theres the fact that our 
Lord and Savior wasnt even 
born on Christmas  some think
September or October may be 
a more accurate date. Its cel
ebrated on Dec. 25 because that 
date is close to the winter solstice 
and other pagan winter festivals. 
The word yule, as in log, comes 
from the Anglo-Saxon word 
geol for a solstice festival. What 
better way to get pagans to cel
ebrate your holiday by combining 
it with their traditions? Whos 
not to say that Im actually cel
ebrating Agnostic Children Get 
Presents (And Eat Cookies) Day, 
which falls on Dec. 25, so every
one can celebrate in harmony? 
The Christmas tree is pagan, too,
did you know? You heathens.
By the way, nobody has ever 
told me that I shouldnt celebrate 
Hanukkah, so Ill let the Jews off 
the hook this time, but if anybody 
would like to e-mail me and tell 
me that I cant light my menorah 
and make my grandmas latke 
recipe because I havent been to a 
synagogue since my cousins bar 
mitzvah, then Id be happy to yell 
at you, too.
The last thing I want is a bor
ing, surgical separation of church 
and state so that we have to go to 
school during Christmas, we cant 
put up lights or play Christmas

music (its annoying but I love it 
anyway), and coworkers are fired 
for saying Merry Christmas 
or Happy Hanukkah and not 
Happy Holidays. I think every
body should get the whole month 
of December off from school, and 
half of January for good measure, 
to cover all holidays, and every
body should eat, drink, sing, 
give presents, and be happy. I 
do think that commercialism gets 
really out of hand at Christmas, 
and that its great to choose 
hand-made presents or charity 
donations instead of expensive 
presents that will lie on shelves

THE TARTAN  DECEMBER 3, 2007
Swim teams 
compete in 
Nike Cup
Tartan basketball falls on the road, wins home tournament

Left: Sophomore guard Jack Anderson (#22) shoots over traffic during Carnegie Mellons game against Haverford. Right: Junior forward Ryan Einwag (#10) pulls in a rebound.
BASKETBALL, from AIO
in the game. Haverford went on a 
run to make the final score closer 
but it was too little, too late.
Einwag led the team with 
15 points, and Gonzalez had a 
double-double with 14 points 
and 10 rebounds. Kozak and An
derson each chipped in with 12 
points.
Against Ohio Northern, the 
Tartans took a seven-point lead
into halftime only to have the Po
lar Bears score 14 straight points 
to start the second half. Carn
egie Mellon responded with 11 
straight points to regain the lead, 
and never looked back.
Einwag poured in 20 points 
to lead the Tartans, and he was 
rewarded by being named the 
tournaments Most Outstanding 
Player. Anderson and Gonzalez 
added 10 points apiece in the 
win, with Gonzalez leading the
team with nine rebounds.
One of the good things about 
this years team is that we have 
a lot of depth and a lot of ex
perience, Gonzalez said. We 
have a few goals for the season. 
Our conference currently has 
the sixth-, seventh-, and eighthranked teams in the country, so 
its pretty stacked at the top.... 
We dont see any reason why we 
cant compete to win the con
ference again this year like we
did in 05-06. Also after a long 
drought of nothing in March, we 
have put together three straight 
years of post-season play. We 
are all planning on playing bas
ketball during spring break. 
Whether its ECACs or NCAAs, 
we are shooting for post-season 
play. We have a long way to go 
to achieve both those goals, but 
this team has a lot of heart and a 
lot of fight. The Rochester game 
was a disappointment for sure,
but no one expects to be playing 
their best basketball this early in 
the season. Coach is still putting 
together lineups and mixing and 
matching a lot of things trying to 
figure out whats best.
The Tartans next play at Cath
olic University this Saturday in 
Washington, D.C. The game is 
scheduled for 4 p.m. The Tartans 
have one more home game this 
year, on Thursday, Dec. 20, when 
they host Christopher Newport.
SWIMMING, from A10
made the preliminary B cut 
with a fourth-place finish in 
the finals. Huber set a school 
record with a time of 57.34. Five 
other Tartans also made the 
B cut, including juniors Brad 
Henderson and Ryan Hofler, 
sophomores Andrew Seo and 
Mingwei Hsu, and first-year 
Max Gustafson.
The mens 200-yard freestyle 
relay finished the day strong as 
they set a new season record of 
1:25.92. The Tartans time was 
only two seconds away from 
reaching the B cut. The team 
consisted of Snyder, sophomore 
Jeff Dahlen, Henderson, and 
Bailey.
We had a really good meet, 
said senior co-captain Andy 
Douglass. We rested for the 
meet, which is something that 
we usually only do for UAAs, 
so we were planning on have 
really fast times.
The mens team would not 
outdo the womens team, as 
they too went on to set several 
school records Friday.
Evans finished the 200-yard 
freestyle in sixth overall, with a 
time of 1:53.83. She went on to 
break the Carnegie Mellon 400- 
yard freestyle record, finishing 
with a time of 4:33.75.
Andrews swam a career best 
100-yard breaststroke with a 
time of 1:07.97. The Tartans also 
set a season record for the 200- 
yard freestyle relay with a time 
of 1:39.58. The team consisted 
of Connell, Evans, Andrews, 
and first-year Brianne Burton.
Three swimmers competed 
for the womens team on the 
final day of competition. Evans 
whirled her way to a thirdplace finish in the 200-yard 
backstroke. Her time of 2:04.71 
was good enough for not only a 
school record, but also a spot in 
the NCAA championships.
The men finished the 
tournament with a fourthplace finish overall. The finish 
put them ahead of Division I 
competitor Davidson College 
and Division III opponents 
Johns Hopkins University and 
Washington & Lee University.
Weve never had a mid-sea
son meet like this, where we 
rest and race against competi
tion of this level, Douglass said. 
So it was a new experience for 
all of us at Carnegie Mellon, but 
people responded well. More 
than half the team achieved 
best times, and we were able 
to get up and compete against 
some of the best swim teams in 
the nation.
The Tartans continues af
ter winter break when they 
travel to Case Western Reserve 
University on Jan. 12. The meet 
will begin at 1 p.m.

NEW YEARNEW OPTIONS
When students return for the spring they may notice a slight change on campus 
regarding their beverage options in campus dining and vending locations. Last spring 
representatives from the Division of Campus Services began negotiating a Pouring 
Rights Agreement with The Pepsi Bottling Corporation. The purpose of the agreement 
is to ensure the best pricing for campus venues and services.
The majority of dining locations currently serve Pepsi products. Students will see a 
variety of new beverages added as a resuit of the agreement. As far as Coke products 
are concerned, the agreement allows for Coke products to be available in a third of the 
campus vending machines and Entropy +. An assessment of the current use will be 
completed to determine where and what Coke selections should be maintained.
The greatest impact will be seen at catering events. Currently, the catering operations 
serve Coca Cola products. The catering staff will work with their clients to make the 
transition to Pepsi.
Students may direct any feedback to the Housing and Dining Services office by 
emailing plaid@andrew.cmu.edu. In an effort to respond to student questions, staff 
will schedule attendance at Senate and Student Dormitory Council meetings.

Mens baskeball falls in first UAA challenge
Joey Gannon/Photo Staff
Senior guard Geoff Kozak (#3) goes up for a two-pointer during the 
Tartans home game against Haverford on Saturday, Nov. 24.
by Doug Fricker
Senior Sports Staff
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball teams University
Athletic Association opener this 
past Saturday was no cakewalk. 
The Tartans traveled to the Uni
versity of Rochester to play the 
sixth-ranked Yellowjackets. De
spite hanging tough for most
of the game, Carnegie Mellon 
fell to Rochester 64-50 to snap 
a three-game winning streak 
and move to 3-2 overall on the 
young season. Prior to Roches
ter, the Tartans hosted and won 
the Radisson/Carnegie Mellon 
tournament over Thanksgiving 
weekend.
The Tartans came out of the 
gate strong against Rochester, 
taking a 15-10 lead with 11:52 
remaining in the first half after a 
layup by senior guard Geoff Ko
zak. Rochester reeled off seven 
straight points to retake the lead, 
and the score stayed at a twopoint advantage for Rochester 
heading into halftime at 31-29.
We came out really strong and 
I think we controlled the tempo in 
the first half well, said graduate 
student center Greg Gonzalez. 
We penetrated against the zone 
well and were doing good things 
to put us in position to win the 
game.
Sophomore Jack Anderson hit 
a three-pointer to start the scor
ing for the Tartans in the second 
half. Rochester then went on a 
13-1 run to take a 46-33 lead, 
with the Tartans turning the ball 
over and missing some threepointers during Rochesters 
spree.
Rochester built up a 21-point 
lead at 58-37 with 4:01 remain
ing before the Tartans narrowed 
their margin of defeat to 14. 
First-year Shane Rife scored 
eight of Carnegie Mellons final
13 points.
Its always a tough place to 
play because they have pretty 
ruthless fans, Gonzalez said. 
The fans were in full force, but 
everyone on the team has either 
played there before or played
with a rowdy crowd, so we didnt 
really get up for it any differ
ent than any other conference 
game.
The Tartans were dominated 
in the rebound department as 
Rochester held a 45-27 edge. 
Rochester benefited from 22 
offensive rebounds, with the Yel
lowjackets taking 11 more shots 
than Carnegie Mellon in the 
game.
Anderson led the Tartans with
14 points and Rife finished with
10. Junior forward Ryan Einwag 
was held to eight points on only 
five shots. Carnegie Mellon shot
35.3 percent for the game, while 
Rochester made 41.9 percent of 
their field goals.
Rochester was led by their 
powerful duo of forwards Uche 
Ndubizu and Jon Onyiriuka. 
Ndubizu scored a game-high
16 points and pulled down 13 
rebounds (11 offensive), and On
yiriuka had 15 points and nine 
boards.
Over Thanksgiving weekend, 
the Tartans hosted the Radisson/ 
Carnegie Mellon tournament. 
They defeated Haverford College 
on Saturday, Nov. 24 by a score 
of 73-59, and then beat Ohio 
Northern in the championship 
game the next day 71-60.
The team fought really hard 
in both games and did a great job 
of keeping our foot down on the 
accelerator, Gonzalez said. One 
of our preseason goals was to win 
this tournament, and we wanted 
to make sure we achieved that.
Against Haverford, the Tar
tans had four starters in double 
figures as they maintained a 22- 
point lead with five minutes left

Womens basketball wins three of four contests
by Rae Wen Shee
Junior Staffwriter
Over the last two weeks, the 
Carnegie Mellon womens bas
ketball team improved its season 
record to 5-1, with wins on the 
road over Grove City College, 
Frostburg State University, and 
Waynesburg University.
The Tartans suffered one loss 
against Capital University 39-77 
in the opening game of the Ohio 
Wesleyan Bishop Classic Hoops 
for Hope Tournament Friday, 
Nov. 23.
Tuesday, Nov. 20, the Tar
tans recorded a 59-47 victory 
over Grove City, as junior guard 
Stacie Aleski led all scorers with 
a season-high 19 points along 
with eight rebounds and two 
steals. Junior forward Jeanette 
Schilling added 10 points in the 
victory, while junior forward 
Rachelle Roll contributed a 
season-high 11 rebounds.
Friday, Nov. 23, saw the open
ing game of the Ohio Wesleyan 
Bishop Classic for the Tartans, 
who first faced 13th-ranked Cap
ital. For the first time this season,
the Tartans came up short, fall
ing 39-77 to a talented Capital 
team.
Capital is a great team; they 
are ranked in the country and 
they are a great example of what 
we should strive to become, 
Schilling said.
The Tartans struggled with 
their shooting in the first half as 
Capital raced to a 38-14 halftime 
lead, hitting 51.7 percent of their 
shot attempts (including five 
threes), while the Tartans made 
just 18.8 percent of their shots.
In the second half, the 
Crusaders continued with their 
red-hot shooting, extending their 
lead and eventually wrapping up 
a well-deserved victory over the 
Tartans.
Junior forward Ashley Rothwell led the Tartans with 11 
points, while Schilling contrib
uted eight rebounds. Capitals 
Kristen Richardson led all play
ers with 15 points. With the win, 
the Crusaders improved to 3-0 
while Carnegie Mellon dropped 
to 3-1.
The next day, the Tartans 
rebounded from their disap
pointing loss to Capital with a
convincing 57-53 victory over 
Frostburg in the consolation 
game of the tournament. Three 
players posted double figures 
for the Tartans, who jumped out 
to an early nine-point lead just 
seven minutes into the game. 
Meanwhile, the Bobcats man
aged just three baskets over this 
seven-minute span in which the 
Tartans led 15-6.
The Bobcats then followed 
with an aggressive run to pull to 
within two on a layup by Ashley 
Anthony with 3:02 remaining in 
the first half, closing the score 
at 19-17. Not willing to let up, 
the Tartans answered strongly 
with a 10-3 run of their own to 
end the half when junior Corey 
Innes and Schilling each hit two 
free throws and a basket; the 
Bobcats missed all seven of their 
attempts.
The second half began with 
the Tartans on fire as they hit 
seven of their first 11 shots, end
ing on a three-pointer by Innes 
at the 7:20 mark, which gave the 
Tartans a 51-32 advantage and 
their largest lead of the game.
Though a late Frostburg run 
closed the gap to three with 1:11

to play, the Tartans were able to 
hold on to their lead and record 
their fourth win in five games. 
Innes, Schilling, and senior Leah 
Feola each had 10 points for the 
Tartans, while Rothwell led the 
team with nine boards off the 
glass. Roll and Feola also pulled 
down eight apiece.
We are really playing as a 
team right now and are very 
intense defensively, which is 
helping to create our offense, 
Schilling said.
Last Wednesday, the Tartans 
built on their win over Frost
burg with a 60-50 triumph 
over Waynesburg. Aleski scored 
a game-high 18 points to go 
with her four steals, and Schil
ling tallied double figures for 
the second straight game with
10 points. Roll also contributed 
seven rebounds, nine points, and 
a career-high seven assists in the 
win.
The Tartans now have to pre
pare for their upcoming games 
in Cancn, Mexico, which begins 
Friday, Dec. 20. Carnegie Mellon 
will face Concordia University 
Texas and the University of La 
Verne at the tournament.

Carnegie Mellon mens bas
ketball team defeated Ohio 
Northern University 71-60 
in the championship game of 
the Radisson/Carnegie Mellon 
tournament on Sunday, Nov.
25. The Tartans improved their 
record to a 3-1.
Last week, The Tartan 
chatted with Ryan Einwag, a 
junior guard. Einwag led scor
ing with 20 points against Ohio 
Northern and was named the 
tournaments Most Outstanding 
Player.
Tartan: How did you first get 
involved in basketball?
Einwag: I used to just dribble 
a ball when I was younger, even 
when I wasnt strong enough 
to make a shot yet. My dad 
signed me up to play in an inhouse league when I was in first 
grade, and I had a lot of fun, so I 
stuck with it.
T: Was playing basketball a 
part of your decision to come to 
Carnegie Mellon?
E: I knew I wanted to play 
basketball in college if I could, 
so it was a factor for all of the 
schools that I considered. I liked 
the coaching staff and program 
here, and Carnegie Mellon had 
the best academic programs, so 
it was an easy choice.
T: How do you manage 
Carnegie Mellons academic 
load and basketball?
E: It can get hard sometimes 
because the heavy schoolwork 
always seems to pile up at 
certain times throughout the 
semester. During those times, 
I do my best to get started on
projects and studying before I 
normally would. Im sure ev
ery student at Carnegie Mellon 
feels as though they have a lot 
of work at times, so its probably 
not very different.
T: Do you think playing a 
sport gives you a different expe
rience at Carnegie Mellon?
E: I think it does in the sense 
that I spend most of my time 
with my teammates. We live, 
eat, work out, and hang out 
together during our free time, 
especially during the season. I 
dont think most other students 
here spend as much time with 
the same 15 guys, but we all 
really enjoy it. We also get to 
travel to a lot of places that I 
might not ever see otherwise, 
so thats fun.
T: Do you have any pre-game 
rituals or good luck charms?
E: I try not to put my uniform 
on too early before a game be
cause if I sit around too long I 
get anxious. I wait until I have 
just enough time to get loose 
with some stretching.
T: Do you have a most memo
rable game?
E: My freshman year, we 
played Princeton over the win
ter break. Its always fun to play 
against Division I teams who 
are supposed to be a lot better 
than you. We were able to beat 
them 51-46. Im sure Ill never 
forget that game.
T: Do you have any personal 
or team goals in mind?
E: My personal and team 
goals are the same. I hope to 
improve individually and help 
us to improve as a team each 
day in practice and in games. If 
we succeed in doing that, every
thing else will take care of itself 
and well still be playing deep 
into March.
T: What do you think of the 
new mascot?
E: I like it a lot, actually. It is 
a Scottie dog, but it has a mean 
look to it. Its sharp.
T: What do you think could be 
done to improve school spirit, 
especially for athletics?
E: We are going to try to 
spread the word about our team 
and athletics in general around 
campus. We hope to get more 
students interested by word of 
mouth, posters, and Facebook. 
Obviously having a great season 
will gain the attention of the 
university too.
T: Do you have any big plans 
for winter break?
E: I look forward to having 
more free time and enjoying 
the holidays with my family 
and friends. A big chunk of our 
season is played over break, so 
thats where my focus will be.

Swim teams face stiff competition at Kenyon

Over the weekend, sophomore Sara Andrews set a personal record in the 100-yard breastroke.
by Brian Friedrick
Staffwriter
Last weekend, the swim 
teams participated in the annual 
Nike Cup Invitational, which
in Gambier, Ohio. The Tartans 
continued their team and indi
vidual successes, setting several 
school records throughout the 
invitational.
The meet began Thursday and 
ran through Saturday, featuring
took lace at Kenyon College Carnegie Mellon a^d other Division III schools, as well as compe
tition from Divisions I and II. The 
Tartan men took fourth overall 
in the tournament, while the 
womens team placed seventh.
Thursday, the womens team 
took the water in the 800-yard 
freestyle. The team of sbphomore
Sara Andrews, first-year Molly 
Evans, junior Allison Retotar, 
and senior Lauren Connell fin
ished with a time of 7:52.40. 
Although the time was not quite 
enough to qualify the Tartans

More than a sandwich
A lk aV PriDanVi Brs. ResVakranV
On their salads or their sandwiches, Pittsburghers 
have a strange desire to put French fries on top of 
almost everything. This odd habit can be traced 
back to Joe Primanti, founder of Primanti Bros. 
Restaurant.
The Primanti legacy dates back to the days of the 
Great Depression, when Primanti and his nephew 
opened a small lunch counter in the Strip District.
The story behind the Primanti sandwich varies, 
but the official account is that, on a cold winter 
day, someone delivering a load of potatoes to a 
nearby warehouse stopped by Primantis to see 
if his potatoes were frozen. The cook at the time,
John DePriter, took some of the potatoes and fried 
them on the grill. A few of the customers eating 
there asked for some of the potatoes. DePriter 
put them atop their sandwiches and the Primanti 
sandwich was born.
Everything you need to know
About hot vegans and unwanted chivalry
Primantis original clientele consisted mostly of 
truck drivers and warehouse workers. Though 
these originals have long been replaced by 
weekend-shoppers and clubbers, the sandwich 
has remained virtually the same. The only 
difference is that now coleslaw and tomatoes are 
heaped atop the sandwich alongside the fries.
This sandwich has turned Primanti Brothers into 
a Pittsburgh institution. From its original location 
on the Strip, the restaurant has expanded into 
Downtown, Oakland, and the South Side, in 
addition to some suburban locations; there are 
even two Primantis in Florida.
Primanti's menu consists predominantly of 
sandwiches. The restaurant offers a wide 
variety of meats, ranging from turkey breast and 
pastrami to sardines and knockwurst. While 
everyone knows that people go to Primantis 
for the sandwiches, the restaurant also offers a 
small selection of salads and side dishes  more 
as a formality than anything else. Theres also 
the Pittsburgher Cheesesteak, which the menu 
advertises as the restaurant's second-best seller.
Primantis cheesesteak would be unrecognizable 
to anyone from Philadelphia (sorry, no cheese 
whiz), or, for that matter, anyone familiar with 
cheesesteaks. In place of the traditional shaved 
beef, Primantis uses  for lack of a better 
description  a rectangular beef patty. Looking 
like something that one might find in a high 
school cafeteria, the meat has an interesting 
texture and consistency, with a somewhat sweet 
taste.
Piled atop the meat and melted provolone cheese 
is a layer of French fries. The fries are dry, bland 
and lacking in salt; as a stand-alone side, the fries 
would have been totally insufficient, but they 
manage to work in the context of the sandwich.
After the fries comes the coleslaw, while helps to 
make up for the fries deficiencies. The coleslaw 
is made from vinegar, rather than the typical
mayonnaise, resulting in a sweet and sour taste. 
Ground pepper, which noticeably speckles the 
shredded cabbage, rounds out its flavor.
Primantis tops off its sandwich with 
anemic-looking sliced tomatoes, which were 
relatively tasteless. The tomatoes added nothing 
 except for maybe a little vitamin C.
It does not come standard on all sandwiches, but 
a fried egg should be added. It may seem like a 
strange bedfellow with the other ingredients, but 
the egg melds terrifically with the melted cheese, 
making this combination one of the sandwich's 
most satisfying components.
The buzzword "synergy is usually reserved for 
business, but there is perhaps no better word to 
describe the phenomenon that occurs when all 
of the ingredients come together. Despite the 
strange look of the meat and the bland taste of 
the French fries, when the ingredients combine, 
they form a very satisfying sandwich.
Thinking of a Primanti sandwich as, well, 
nothing more than a sandwich, may make its - 
$7 price seem rather steep. But looking at that 
cheesesteak and seeing only a sandwich would 
be like looking at the Guggenheim and seeing 
only a building  it misses the point entirely.' 
What patrons are paying for is a full meal: meat, 
French fries, and coleslaw, sandwiched between 
two generous slices of crusty Italian bread.
While I do not plan on returning to Primantis 
anytime soon, I certainly do not regret my visit. 
What I do regret was ordering a soda  pop 
in the local vernacular  instead of a beer.
A sandwich as unabashedly Pittsburgh as a 
Primanti deserves to be washed down with an 
Iron City.

Dear Myrtle,
Im dating a really great guy  
sweet, hot, considerate, with 
a really nice butt  theres just 
one problem: Im a carnivore, 
and hes a vegan. Ive heard all 
his explanations for his choice to 
go vegan, and I fully support it  
I just dont want to give up meat 
myself. The problem is, I basically 
have! Every time we go out to 
eat, if I order something with 
meat in it, I get to hear all about 
the nations slaughterhouses. If 
I get an omelet, Im treated to 
a description of chickens with 
their beaks cut off. The only time 
I get to have a guilt-free meal is 
if I order total rabbit food, or if 
hes not there. Plus, Im getting 
sick of making salad and veggie 
stir-fry  the only vegan things I 
know how to make.
*
When were not eating, hes the 
best guy Ive ever met. Do I have 
to go vegan to keep this guy?
Wont Eat No Tofu
Hey there WENT,
Dating somebody with different 
values than yours (whether that 
means vegan and carnivore, 
Methodist and Muslim, or country 
and hard rock) means that you 
should respect the other person's 
beliefs  not that you should change 
to be like them. Youre letting this 
guy walk his little vegan feet all over 
you! He made his spiel, you listened, 
you disagreed  end of story. 
Youre already doing everything he 
could ask of you  you support his 
choice and even cook vegan crap 
for him. Now, its time to have a long 
talk with Vegan Boy and to tell him 
that you have a right to your own 
choices and that he needs to decide 
between you  sausages and all  
and the door. If hes really as sweet 
and considerate as you say, he 
^should pick you. If he picks the door, 
then you can kick his hot little butt 
right out of it. If a guy who doesnt 
respect your choices is the best guy 
' youve ever met, WENT, you need to 
meet some more guys!
Be brave,
Myrtle
Dear Myrtle,
I want an answer to an ageold problem  who should 
pay on a date? Im kind of an 
old-fashioned guy  the doorholding, check-picking-up type
 and in the past some girls 
have yelled at me for being a 
chauvinist for this, but I think 
its just polite. And sometimes, 
when I ignore the check, I get 
dirty looks. What should I do? 
Its not as if I can afford to screw 
up any more dates, Myrtle.
-Old-Fashioned Fella
Hey OFF,
I cant answer for all women, 
because there are plenty out there 
who would take your actions for 
chivalry (or maybe even for granted) 
and plenty more who would be 
royally pissed off. But Id say 
keep holding the door  any girl 
bothered by that has seriously got 
a porcupine up her butt. And its 
okay to carry heavy stuff, too, but 
ask her first  and if she says no, 
dont push it. Girls dont like to be 
thought of as helpless, but we do 
like to be helped. As for the check, 
offer to take it on the first date, but 
don't just pay automatically each 
time. You could also say, Ill get it
 you can get the next one. Not 
only does that further the cause of 
equality, but youre telling her that 
you want to see her again. Don't 
give up, OFF, youll find a girl who 
doesnt take your attempts to be 
nice so personally.
Good luck,
Myrtle

Deliveries dot com
The top five items on Campusfood.com
Campusfood.com has been indulging college students 
voracious appetites (and utter laziness) since 1997. The online 
company, which calls itself a "virtual food court, has taken 
the work out of ordering food for delivery. Forget the hassle 
of searching for misplaced menus and the inconvenience of 
having to speak to an actual human being on the phone  
with Campusfood.com, delivery menus are always at your 
fingertips, and your General Tsos chicken is just a few clicks 
away.
With finals quickly approaching, time is of the essence, which 
can make campus eateries (and their lines) seem even less 
appealing. So if you find yourself wanting to order in, our 
guide to the top five dishes on Campusfood.com should be to 
your advantage.
1. Deluxe Buffalo Chicken Hoagie, Parma Pizza $5.79 
for 8, $8.99 for 16"
With its breaded chicken, spicy buffalo sauce, melted 
provolone, and buffalo fries, the buffalo chicken hoagie is a 
Pittsburgh classic  and for good reason. This hoagie strikes 
the perfect balance between heat and flavor, crunchiness 
and gooeyness. Though you can order this delectable sub 
from several of Campusiood.com's pizza joints, only Parma 
Pizza offers the deluxe version, which comes with tomatoes, 
lettuce, and onions for even more flavor. Parmas deluxe 
buffalo chicken hoagie also comes with blue cheese dressing, 
but those uncomfortable with eating moldy cheese can feel 
free to request a substitute.
2. Large Pizza and Breadsticks Special, Parma Pizza
$7.99
Frogs and dogs and bears, oh my!
The top five modern advertisement campaigns for food
separate animals, continued even when the second frog 
apparently had a panic attack and had to be replaced by 
Frank.
4. Taco Bell - Way before Paris Hilton started carrying 
around Unkerbelle, there was much cooler Chihuahua on the 
block. This one was oddly dedicated to Taco Bell, with the 
war cry: "Yo quiero Taco Bell!" Many attribute the Taco Bell 
dog to the rise in popularity of Chihuahua dogs around this 
time, but he was also a huge marketing tool for Taco Bell.
In addition to burritos, sales of his stuffed counterpart were 
through the roof, especially the versions that said one of three 
things: jYo quiero Taco Bell!", "Viva Gordita!, or Drop the 
chalupa!"
5. Subway - Seven subs with six grams of fat or less.
Subway was the first major restaurant to celebrate its 
healthiness. Remember Jared? Inspired by the weight he 
lost by eating Subway subs, people flocked to the restaurant, 
gaining it a huge following. Even today, a few years later, the 
phrase "eat fresh immediately reminds people of Subway. 
Subway was the first restaurant to start this trend, now huge 
in part to its great marketing.

Weve all seen them. Theyre the commercials that get 
discussed around the watercooler (or the Black Chairs) the 
Monday after the Super Bowl. They're the commercials that 
inspire the oddest cravings at the oddest times, making 
executives rich and ad companies famous. Most importantly, 
theyre the commercials that make our wallets smaller and our 
pants just a little tighter  well, most of them, anyway.
Below are five of the greatest food ad campaigns. Some of
them are funny, some of classic, but on the whole, 
they have one thing in common:
11 . They're memorable.
........L
1. Milk - "Got Milk? This slogan started in 1993, when the 
sales of milk had been in a 20-year slump. But after the ad 
campaign came out, milk sales skyrocketed. Although simple, 
the ads reminded viewers why they drank milk in the first 
place  it perfectly complements peanut butter sandwiches, 
chocolate chip cookies, and cereal. Today, its hard to name
a celebrity who hasn 't been photographed with a milk 
mustache. And the ad campaign is still working, 14 years 
later, which is a rare occurrence.
2. Coca-Cola - Its getting close to Christmas, which 
means the return a beloved ad campaign  the Coca-Cola 
polar bears. As one of the biggest companies in the world, 
Coca-Cola has had many great ad campaigns  including the 
1979 classic featuring Steelers player Mean Joe Greene  but 
this one stands out. Many link these commercials to the start 
of the holiday season, waiting eagerly for them to show up 
each December. The adorable polar bears (and penguins, at 
least last year) help give Coca-Cola a feeling of tradition and 
warmth. Beat that, Pepsi.
3. Budweiser - The series of commercials with the 
Budweiser frogs  shown in part during Super Bowl XXXII 
 is probably one of the most memorable sets ever created. 
Along with bitter diatribes from lizard Frank to his best friend 
Louis, these commercial could always be counted on to say, 
Bud. Wise. Er." These words. SDoken seDaratelv bv three
Parmas pizza is for cheese lovers and sauce lovers alike. It 
is unquestionably a pie of excess  the pizza has a nearly 
impenetrable layer of mozzarella with a veritable lava pit of 
sauce underneath. The breadsticks (included with the pizza) 
are well-seasoned and soft, and come with a marinara dipping 
sauce. The food is great, but the best part about this dish is 
the deal. At $7.99, you and your roommate can split a 16" pie 
and an order of breadsticks for just $4 each (including tip).
3. Giant Gourmet Veggie Club, Jimmy Johns Gourmet 
Sandwiches $5.65
This super-sized sandwich isn't just for vegetarians. Its 
double order of provolone, cucumber, alfalfa, lettuce, tomato, 
and mayo is highlighted by Jimmy John's unbelievable 
avocado spread. (For 80 cents more, you can get an extra 
helping of the avocado spread. Its worth it.) You can order the 
sandwich on homemade French bread, seven-grain bread, 
or in a low-carb lettuce wrap (dubbed the "JJ Unwich"). The 
only drawback to this sandwich is how hard it is to wrap your 
mouth around it.
4. Penang Sauce Rice Dish, Sun Penang $6.50 for a lunch 
portion
Sun Penang restaurant is a relatively new addition to 
Campusfood.com, bringing a welcome culinary diversity 
to the websites offerings with its Malaysianand South 
Asian-inspired food. The restaurants Penang sauce rice 
dish is the star of the menu. Penang, a dry curry that is both 
spicy and tangy, perfectly complements the dishs variety of 
proteins and vegetables. The Penang sauce rice dish comes 
with your choice of vegetables, tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp.
5. Roast Pork Lo Mein, Chopstix $3.95 for a pint, $6.95 for 
a quart
This dish is basic, yummy, and cheap. The lo mein isn't too 
oily or dry and the pork is totally tender. Most importantly, the 
price is right: A pint of lo mein is only $3.95.

A madrigal moment
Carnegie Mellon revives a celebratory tradition
Amid age-old holiday carols and cries of "God save 
the King!", over 200 members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, young and old, were dinner guests at King 
Henry IV's royal table Saturday night in Rangos Ballroom. 
The event, called the Madrigal Dinner, was a whos-who 
of medieval notables, complete with king, queen, 
court, jesters, magicians, choristers, servants, beggars, 
trumpeters, and, of course, a royal bagpiper.
The dinner itself was a period creation, including braised 
beef and wassail (apple cider, but whos checking?), 
served by waiters outfitted by the drama department, 
who also dressed the court and performers.
Because Carnegie Mellon has not has a Madrigal dinner 
for years, many attendees did not know exactly what to 
expect besides a fun time. "Im excited; Im expecting 
good food and I'm looking forward to the singing," said 
Adam Richardson, a junior voice major, on his way in.
On paper, the dinner may have seemed like a quirky 
product of the music department, but it was really much 
more. Saturday's event marked the revival of a unique 
Carnegie Mellon tradition, encompassing the universitys 
talents in art, music, and dramatic performance. 
Moreover, the dinner saw a very healthy collaboration 
between different academic departments, student 
organizations, and administrative departments to 
produce something that was entertaining for everyone.
The Madrigal Dinner is the brain-child of Anne Witchner, 
now assistant dean of Student Affairs, who held the very 
first dinner in the mid-80s and, with the help of Denise 
Fazio, executive officer of Faculty Senate, held them 
every other year until 1999-2000, when the madrigal 
tradition gave way to Student Affairs' Winter Gala.
This year, Witchner revived the event with the help of 
what seems like everyone on campus, but even that 
didn't make it easy. "Its so hard to get people to really 
get psyched," said Witchner, who deals with motivating 
people for events all the time. I do Orientation, I used to 
do Carnival, I did Buggy  trust me, this is going to be 
great event."
For the dinner, the School of Music supplied the 
madrigal chorus and musicians, the School of Drama 
supplied the court, the Student Affairs staff provided 
actors and entertainers, Student Senate and AB Special 
Events provided funding, AB Tech set up lights and
sound, Chemistry professor Karen Stump performed an 
experiment, and Witchner engaged the event-planning 
skills of her orientation staff. Brittany McCandless, 
a former head orientation counselor and a senior in 
professional writing and international relations, wrote 
the script for the event and coordinated the performers 
activities  she was also the queen.
Witchner noted that Carnegie Mellon is one of many 
schools with annual or biennial madrigal dinners, some 
of which are Christian-based. Its not religious. A lot of 
schools, if you look, will have Christmas trees; we haven't 
done that, Witchner said. Were really the right school 
to do this... Its a true student activities event, bringing 
together the talent of students who are artistic."
The event was anchored by a group of 20 madrigal 
singers from the School of Music under the direction of 
music professor Robert Page, director of choral and opera 
studies, who has directed the singers at every one of 
Carnegie Mellons Madrigal Dinners. We put [this group] 
together just for this; its not a regular thing, said Page, 
who has hand-picked the singers since the dinner's 
inception in the late '80s. We dont do this every year.
We should, but we dont," he added. The choristers 
performed the traditional holiday carols after only four 
rehearsals together, and that was on top of an upcoming 
holiday concert. Still, for Page, Thats whats fun about 
it.
Also on hand were professional jugglers, stilt-walkers, 
and magicians from the Talent Network, Inc., who travel 
the country performing their acts and are old hands at 
Carnegie Mellons dinners. (Howard Mincone, one of the 
physical humorists, glibly noted that a sign outside the 
University Center prohibits juggling.)
Considering the intense planning and preparation that 
went into the event, it is unclear whether the tradition 
will continue on a biennial basis the way it did in the 
past, but it certainly set the bar for a collaborative effort 
to make an event fun for everyone in the university 
community.

On songs about food (again)
Back in September, I wrote a column about food music, briefly 
touching upon the song Artichoke" from New York City band Cibo 
Mattos 1996 album, Viva! La Woman. In fact, a food motif is present 
throughout the album's nonsensical songs. What results is a very 
successful album, teetering between silliness and seriousness, and 
trip hop and indie rock.
Apple - Apple" begins with a clattering rhythm and whispered 
chant. The song squeaks and chugs like a machine, almost enough 
to be danceable  but then wordless moans creep in and out slowly 
enough to capture your full attention.
Beef Jerky - In the beginning, Beef Jerky sounds like a 1950s 
sitcom  an apron-clad housewife is sweeping joyously, when a 
grizzly bear rips through the door and eats the pie thats cooling on 
the windowsill. Then it gets sassy with vocalist Miho Hatori squealing, 
Who cares? I dont care! and A horses ass is better than yours!"
Sugar Water - Michel Gondry {The Science of Sleep) directed a 
really stunning video for "Sugar Water featuring a split screen with 
the same footage  one playing forward, the other backward. In the 
video, both members of Cibo Matto end up accidentally colliding.
White Pepper Ice Cream - The members of Cibo Matto wonder 
what white pepper ice cream would taste like, eventually determining 
that they do not care. Jazzy brass blasts in and out in the background 
as Hatori's signature whispy vocals float over a sparse beat.
Birthday Cake - In this spunky track, Hatori drops the Miss NiceLady routine and screams at the top of her lungs, busting mad, 
strangely pronounced rhymes. Mainly, Hatori informs listeners that she 
put pot in the cake so they should just shut up and eat it.
Theme - Although not obviously titled after a foodstuff, "Theme" is 
about a sensual meeting with a man drinking a cappuccino in Milan. 
The accidental meeting made my blood red like Chianti, the song 
goes, referencing an Italian red wine.
The Candy Man - Reminiscent of Willy Wonkas creepy but magical 
boat ride, the songs chorus is a modern take on the chipper Candy 
Man song in 1971 s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Still, it 
seems theyre not just singing about the mans candy...
Le Pain Perdu (The Lost Bread) - Using some trumpets and 
dance beat, Cibo Matto compares everyday life to stale bread and a 
dull relationship to overly sweet and mushy maple syrup.

The truth about dieting
Popular weight loss method has its ups and downs
As many American waistlines grow wider and wider, it is no 
wonder that people  especially women  continue to go on 
diets. Most people are aware of several popular diet programs 
(Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, South Beach), and its difficult 
to avoid seeing food advertisements promoting calorieand 
carb-free products. With all the positive publicity surrounding 
diets and the testimonials both in print and on television, its 
difficult to know which diet will actually be successful.
According to a recent UCLA study, the answer may be that 
none of the programs available result in long-term weight 
loss. For the study, researchers tracked a group of dieters over 
a long period to monitor the long-term results of dieting. The 
study found that dieters generally lost weight in the first five 
to six months, but gained back even more than what they lost 
within four to five years.
reported in the article that dieting is not a cure for obesity, 
and that insurance companies should not consider the costs 
of dieting as a medical expense.
Without dieting, obese individuals can undergo significant 
health changes, according to a 2002 study published in the 
International Journal of Obesity. The study split participants 
into two groups, dieters and non-dieters, and followed their 
progress in the program. The end results were that the 
dieting group lost weight, which helped to eliminate some 
of the health risks they would have been suffering; although 
the non-diet group did not lose weight, they showed similar 
health improvements as well. Participants of the non-diet 
group reported feeling better about themselves, which is an 
indicator that both self-image and health can be improved 
without weight loss.
However, many argue that these are things everyone should 
do to maintain a healthy lifestyle, something more important 
than a number on a scale. For those truly interested in losing 
weight and keeping it off, Martin suggests an alternative to 
dieting.
I use an intuitive eating approach to weight management by 
improving the quality of the diet, encouraging people to listen 
to their bodies, and nourishing without restricting," Martin 
wrote. She also encourages students to pay more attention to 
portion sizes and to realize when they are being served too 
much.
Amanda Cole | Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon's dietician, Paula Martin, agreed with the 
study's conclusion, adding that only a very small percentage 
of dieters are able to successfully maintain their post-diet 
weight loss. In addition, Martin criticized the popular belief 
that weight is the best indicator of health.
Health comes in many sizes and a bigger concern is when 
we see college students that are already at healthy body 
weights trying to reduce [their] weight through unhealthy 
means," Martin stated in an e-mail.
An April 3 article released by UCLA stated that dieting is, 
in fact, a predictor of future weight gain. Dieters, both male 
and female, gained more weight within a two-year period 
than non-dieters. Traci Mann, one of the authors of the study,
The raw hype
Why so many celebrities skip the
Alicia Silverstone, Demi Moore, and Bill Cosby are all 
enthusiasts for the raw food lifestyle, which promises health, 
natural beauty, and a sound state of mind through eating 
uncooked foods.
The raw food movement began in the 1930s and has grown in 
popularity over the years  followers are commonly referred 
to as raw foodists. Essential to the raw food lifestyle is the 
belief in the power of enzymes; raw foodists believe that 
cooking zaps the food of nutritional value and enzymes. They 
eat fruits, vegetables, seafood, dairy, and meats that have 
not been cooked at temperatures higher than 120F to avoid 
destroying enzymes and nutritional value.
Opponents of the raw food lifestyle believe that most raw food 
enthusiasts are not realistic about the long term effects of 
eating a 100-percent raw food diet. According to an article in 
WeUness Foods, Dr. Mark Anthony asserted that a 100-percent 
raw food diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies. "The usual 
argument against the all-raw diet is that there are risks for 
deficiencies, particularly calcium, iron, and B12, Anthony 
wrote. The risk of deficiency is present with any restricted 
diet....Thats why 'variety, balance, and moderation is not
 merely a clich but a solid nutritional defense strategy."
In her book Eating in the Raw, supermodel Carol Alt describes 
her experiences crash dieting, which often made her sick.
The next questions to be answered in the great diet 
debate are not which types of diets work, but are people 
better off never having dieted at all," Martin wrote. "Studies 
consistently show a positive association between frequent 
dieters having a higher Body Mass Index than non-dieters or 
those who have never dieted.
She added, "College women who are intuitive eaters have 
less food preoccupation, reduced anxiety about body image, 
and healthier BMIs.
The evidence that dieting is an unsuccessful method of losing 
weight presents a challenge to overweight people who want 
to get in shape. Without diets, other methods of weight loss 
must be considered, such as exercise and lifestyle changes.
stove
Frustrated, Alt began eating raw foods. Unlike the millions 
of people who deprive themselves on diets, I eat as much 
as I want  so long as its raw," she wrote. I dont weigh 
anything. Thats something I let my body dictate."
Once a person decides to switch to a raw food lifestyle it is 
essential to have fresh food sources available and a positive 
attitude about eating raw foods. Once you begin to think 
about food differently and to see raw food as food and cooked 
food as garbage it becomes easy" Alt wrote, describing what 
kept her motivated. "Practically speaking, its all a matter of 
changing habits.
Ready to eat raw? Below are a few tips to ensure that your raw 
food journey will be a success. These steps can be applied 
gradually to your current eating habits.
1. Start step by step. Switching from a typical American 
diet to a raw food diet requires a major shift in vitamin and 
caloric intake. Your body will welcome the change, but a 
gradual change will ease your mind and taste buds into the 
process.
2. Stock up your pantry with basic raw food needs.
The beauty about the raw food diet is that it requires a lot 
of creative ideas to create new meals from scratch. Not 
having basic raw food cooking necessities can make both the
Ho-Jung Kim | Art Staff
transition and food bland. The website www.rawfood.com 
offers a variety of raw food essentials, including appliances 
and supplements.
3. Find raw food recipes you love. During the transitional 
phase, you may be faced with moments in which you miss 
your favorite foods. Still, no matter what that food may be, 
chances are there is a similar raw food recipe. Whether
you love falafel, milk shakes, or cookies, you can find great 
recipes in raw food cookbooks, including Rawvolution by 
Matt Amsden, Eating in the Raw by Carol Alt, and Eating for 
Beauty by David Wolfe.
4. Plan out your meals. Create weekly menus to help map 
out your food's nutritional value. Planning your meals will also 
ensure that you are getting variety in your meal choices.
5. Do your homework. Before starting the raw food lifestyle 
it is important to make sure that the lifestyle is right for
you: Do you have enough time to prepare your meals from 
scratch? What is your motivation? To research, read books 
and articles about the positives and negatives of the raw food 
lifestyle. Helpful websites include www.live-live.com, www. 
living-foods.com, and www.rawfoodlife.com.

Foodie top fives
Hooray for butterbeer
Top five foods you wish were real
1. Butterbeer  J. K. Rowlings drink of choice in the Harry 
Potter series is rarely described, but that doesnt stop her from 
mentioning that its all her beloved characters like to drink.
Intrigued, fans of Rowlings work have theorized a multitude 
of online recipes, from a hot-chocolate-like drink to regular 
beer with added butter. Of these, the best idea is cream soda 
mixed with butterscotch schnapps.
2. Neds pies on Pushing Daisies The colors on Pushing 
Daises are delightfully over-the-top and vibrant, and the pies 
made at fictional hangout The Pie Hole are no exception.
They practically glow, and they look delicious. Just dont eat it 
while thinking about how the fruit is dead.
3. The Flaming Moe  So what if the secret ingredient in 
this Simpsons concoction is childrens cough syrup? All that 
matters is that this needs to be set on fire to be served  
hence the name.
4. Krabby Patty  It sounds disgusting, but SpongeBob 
SquarePants characters Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue 
to insist that it is practically divine. Even the old grump 
Squidward likes this burger with a super-secret recipe, and it 
certainly sounds better than anything Planktons got going on 
at the Chum Bucket.
5. Bachelor Chow  In episodes of the recently resurrected 
show Futurama, the food advertisements often boast, "Now 
with flavor!  which makes products seem less than
appealing. But for that situation where you dont want to eat 
so much as stay alive, Bachelor Chow seems to fill a niche.
Top five foods to make to put off finals
1. Cake  Who doesnt want to have a cake? Its like your 
birthday but without the presents. Cake is not as good as a 
present, but it still tastes delicious.
2. Butterbeer  You have to admit, the cream soda and 
butterscotch schnapps sounded good. Just dont get totally 
smashed before you study. And be 21.
3. Pasta  Its hard enough to get good Italian food on this 
campus  you might as well try and perfect the dish instead 
of hitting the books.
4. Homemade Oreo cookies  Possibly the most timeconsuming and delicious procrastinator tool ever created. 
Find the recipe online at www.smittenkitchen.com, but dont 
go crazy on the white filling  it's much sweeter than its 
cookie counterpart and harder to take in large quantities.
5. Candy cocktail  Throw all of your random favorite 
snacks into a bowl and mix it together  ta-da! Its like trail 
mix, but you dont have to pick out the parts you dont like.
Top five cinematic food scenes
1. The Lady and the Tramp  The spaghetti-eating scene 
is one of the most iconic Disney scenes around.
2. Forrest Gump  The title character's famous line,
Life is like a box of chocolates, changed chocolate forever. 
Chocolate before: the go-to present for husbands looking to 
buy something for anniversaries, birthdays, and Valentines  
Day. Chocolate after: a metaphor for life itself. You can't really 
say anything has done more for chocolate than Fonest Gump.
3. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  It's good 
to know that snotty kids get their comeuppance. In the film, 
the obnoxious Violet annoys even the charming candymaker 
played by Gene Wilder and later by Johnny Depp, and when 
she steals his new prototype gum that tastes like a multi
course dinner, no one is the least bit upset when she turns 
into a giant blueberry.
4. North by Northwest  In this Hitchcock film, Cary 
Grant and Eva Marie Saint share a meal on .a small train car 
and begin to fall in love. After that, they get chased around 
by secret agents for the rest of the movie, before climbing 
down Mt. Rushmore to escape the bad guys. But in North by 
Northwest, it all starts with having something to drink and 
ordering some food while staring into each others eyes.
5. Waitress  In Waitress, Keri Russell brings a pie for her 
elderly doctor when she finds out shes pregnant, only to find 
that her doctor has been replaced by a younger and sexier 
substitute. As the movie progresses, she brings the young 
doctor more and more pies, and he returns the favor.

9:30 a.m. math class youve slept 
through for the'past two months.

Exiled
Thursday, December 6 
8 10 12
Forget the Bloods and the 
Crips, this movie follows Asian 
gangsters. Set in Hong Kong and 
completely in Cantonese, Exiled 
features guns, bangs, and a hot 
lady. The premise: Two guys show 
up at a house looking to protect 
Wo. Two more guys show up at 
house looking to kill Wo. Enter 
Wo, an ex-gangster. Whoa. Many 
Mexican standoffs and even more 
shooting ensue. Its an Eastern 
Western, get It?
The Simpsons Movie
Friday, Dec. 7
8 10 12
Doh! In the popular TV shows 
film debut, Homer Simpson 
has polluted Springfields water, 
supply, so the government traps 
the town under a glass dome 
with plans to destroy it. All the 
favorites are back: Homer, Lisa, 
Bart, Marge, Maggie, Grampa, Mr. 
Burns, Ned Flanders  you name 
it. The movie is just like a really 
long episode of the TV show, so 
only watch it if youre a fan of 
the show, in which case youve 
probably already watched it.
Rush Hour 3
Saturday, Dec. 8 
8:15 10 11:45
Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan 
return once again to do some 
kung fu. And then make some 
funny jokes. And then do a little 
more kung fu. The only thing this 
movie is lacking is. a plot  it-, 
seems the filmmakers just let 
Tucker and Chan joke in front of 
a camera for hours, which can 
be funny but ridiculous. Basically 
its one of those movies you see 
because you saw the first two.
Battle Royale
Sunday, Dec. 9 
7:30 10 12:30
In this gory film, 42 students are 
given three days to kill each other 
until one survives, or else they all 
die. The result is pretty much what 
you would expect: screaming, 
spattering, and gore. The film is 
Japanese, but luckily, violence is just 
one of those things you dont need 
language for. If the impending exams 
are starting to stress you out, watch 
this  itll help with some of that 
anger youve been bottling up.

Bakers Dozen
We've become a fixture here," Gray said. Referring to 
a customer, Gray said, Tammy, who is quite a regular, 
doesnt even have to call anymore. We have her peanut butter 
chocolate ready for her in a bag."
Borensztein, also considered a regular, makes a trip to 
Dozen every Friday for a box of cupcakes for the weekend. 
My brother, sisters, and I are trying to make the perfect 4 
box, the perfect combination of four cupcakes so that were 
all satisfied," Borensztein said. "It's hard. There's a debate 
between the Carrot Cake and Lemon Gingerbread. I always 
get the Milk Chocolate; its still my favorite.
After making a buzz with their cupcakes, Gray and Twigg are 
ready to take Dozen to the next level. In mid-January, Dozen 
Bakery will open in Lawrenceville. The bakery will feature 
freshly baked scones, pastries, cookies, and other sweet treats 
along with a full coffee and tea bar.Brunch will be served 
every Sunday and will include quiche, waffles, and homemade 
granola. TWigg believes the bakery will provide Pittsburgh 
with something it seems to be missing: an inviting, casual 
place for people to eat breakfast.
For now, Gray and Twigg couldnt be happier with what 
theyve been able to accomplish with Dozen Cupcakes. "Its 
cozy and quaint," Gray said. The people who work here are 
very nice. People like the interaction they get here, even if it 
is brief.
Twigg added, That our customers come in every day and tell 
us how much they love our cupcakes and how happy they are 
that we're here thats something were very proud of.
Justine Rae Lee | Staffwriter
Dozen Cupcakes is located at 1707 Murray Ave. 412.420.5135.
Behind Pittsburghs popular cupcake stop
Dozen Cupcakes is conveniently located. Wedged between 
Coldstone Creamery and Panera in Squirrel Hill, the narrow 
bakery covers 700 square feet and seats about six.
Of course, such close proximity is only part of the charm. The 
seating area is tucked.immediately to the right, with three 
tables and chairs opposite a self-serve coffee and tea station.
From here, the main attraction is only a couple steps away: 
rows and rows of finely decorated cupcakes. Thursday's menu 
featured the Vanilla Vanilla, Milk Chocolate, Chocolate Peanut 
Butter, Caramel Apple, Snowball, and the Mint Meltaway. All 
the cupcakes look good  firsttimers often don't know where 
to begin. Luckily, part of the Dozen Cupcakes experience is its 
fine service.
James Gray, the head baker and co-owner of Dozen Cupcakes, 
is happy to help.Do you like peanut butter? he'll ask. What 
about apple?" After a series of questions, Gray can determine 
the perfect cupcake for almost any customer.
What makes Dozen cupcakes unique, Gray believes, is its 
commitment to quality and variety. The menu changes 
every day, with the exception of two permanent, selections, 
the Vanilla Vanilla (white cake with vanilla icing) and Milk 
Chocolate (chocolate cake and chocolate icing).
Gray envisioned Dozen over a year ago; when he moved to 
Pittsburgh and could not find a job he enjoyed, he began to 
think about starting a business. With his formal training at the 
Chicago Culinary School and years of experience as a baker 
and chef, Gray decided to start with cupcakes. Then, Gray 
had to decide what would make the store unique. [Andrew 
and I] wanted our store to be someplace that we would want 
to work, Gray said, referring to Andrew Twigg, Dozens 
other co-owner. We wanted it to have the feeling of a Main 
Street store. You know, very old-style Americana. Nothing 
too pretentious or super modern." An experienced graphic 
designer, Twigg is in charge of branding.
Our design was based on an old, homestyle feel, but we
Dozen Cupcakes co-owner Andrew Twigg 
designed the shop's rustic and cozy look.
wanted to update it and put a more .sophisticated spin on 
it," Twigg said. To this end, Twigg came up with the idea of 
using an old-fashioned sign shape as the frame for the Dozen 
logo, in addition to the selection of colors: red and white  
two colors associated with dairy products  and a saturated 
blue, both bright and cheerful.
Preparation for the store also required market research and 
networking. To get the word out, Gray made charitable 
donations on behalf of Dozen, in addition to placing 
advertisements in local papers. After that, Gray and Twigg 
were confident that Dozen was ready to go.
Or so they thought. Dozen opened its doors on Dec. 29, 2006 
to an enthusiastic line out the door  too enthusiastic. "We 
had no idea the demand was going to be so great, Gray 
recalled. "We had to make the appropriate changes quickly."
"James and Andrew thought it was going to be a small 
business," said Sora Borensztein, a Pittsburgh native who 
worked behind the counter when the store was new. "They 
thought they only needed one person other than themselves.
"We thought wrong," Twigg said. Dozen has since hired three 
bakers, one dishwasher, and four behind-the-counter workers.
For Gray, a typical day begins at 4 a.m., when he, along 
with his assistant baker, bake anywhere from 450 to 1200 
cupcakes. Earlier in the week, Dozen sells around 400 
cupcakes a day, but on Friday and duringthe weekend, they 
sell anywhere from 600 to 1000 cupcakes. Most of the.sales 
are walk-ins, though some are pre-orders for special events, 
including weddings and birthdays.
Nearly a year after its opening, Dozen has found its niche in 
the Pittsburgh community and earned a diverse following: 
college students, families from the city and neighboring 
suburbs, young professionals, and regulars of a variety of ages 
and cultures. Seventy-five percent of Dozen customers are 
repeat customers, and 10 percent of those appear more than 
three times a week.

Chinese food. Seriously.  LS 
Buffalo wings.  MS
Compiled by Sarah Mogin Do you mind if your roommates
eat your food, or are you okay with 
sharing?
Sharing's only okay if you and your roommate 
have established that policy from day one. 
However, its never all right to take your 
roommates last Toaster Strudel. Seriously.
 KC
I am very protective of my food. I do help 
myself to my roommates food, though.  CM
As long as its not my buffalo wings.  MS
If you could eliminate one chunk of the 
food pyramid, what would it be?
Legumes. I don't even know what those are.

I dont even know what chunks are on it 
anymore...  PN
This is a loaded question. I have a wellbalanced diet.  LS
Whats your most embarrassing foodrelated tale?
I once almost killed a lactose-intolerant ex
boyfriend by feeding him a huge vat of ice 
cream. Actually, in retrospect, maybe that 
was a missed opportunity...  SBH
I caught an elderly gentleman stuffing

an orange. That hurt.  BD.

a date.
Largemouth bass! Right?  RC
I don't eat messily, so I guess I wouldnt 
order anything remotely related to chocolate 
because my date would feel terribly ignored.
 MC
Not ordering food. No one wants to date you 
if you go to a nice restaurant and order a Diet 
Coke.  CM
Spaghetti: Lady and the Tramp may have 
taught us to associate the dish with romance, 
but the truth is its messy and requires a lot of 
skillful maneuvering. Save it for the bedroom, 
folks.  SM
Anything that makes you burp... So in my 
case, everything.  MC
What is the prettiest food?
A really fancy sushi platter, with all different 
colors and textures of fish, seaweed sheets 
cut into designs, and glistening caviar.  
SBH
Chocolate cake. The kind you just dont have 
the heart to cut.  MC
Steak.  LS
Name one food you eat with your hands 
that you probably shouldnt.
Bits of raw cookie dough. Salmonella, 
shmalmonella.  SBH
Ive always wondered if you're supposed to 
eat egg rolls with your hand, but Im always 
too embarrassed to ask anyone that could 
possibly know.  PN
Everything. I'm not big on plates.  LS
Whats your favorite food to eat in 
class?
Id love to eat ramen (very slurpily) to annoy 
my professors, but in reality I usually limit 
myself to banana chips and tea.  SBH
Apples, because they are loud and disruptive.
 CMHold the mayo
Japans bizarre obsession with mayonnaise
As a rule of thumb, many imagine that "American cuisine 
abroad is something similar to the actual product; there 
are burger joints throughout Europe, for example, and the 
ubiquitous McDonalds is always a safe bet for an American 
looking to quickly duck back into his or her native culture.
As a Carnegie Mellon student studying abroad, I expected 
the same  but things are a little different here in Japan; 
mainly, it's the mayonnaise. The origin of mayonnaise in Japan, 
particularly its use in American food, is unclear; like many 
Americans, I was always under the impression that the official 
condiment of the U.S. was, in fact, ketchup.
At first, I thought it was just McDonald's. I understood different 
cultures have different versions of McDonalds; for example, 
you wouldnt find a McTeriyaki Burger or a Shrimp Burger in 
the U.S., both of which exist in Japan. Some day later, though, 
when I wandered over to the local pizza joint, I was appalled to 
find corn and tuna pizza smothered with... mayonnaise.
After the pizza experience, I assumed American food was 
the only over-mayonnaised genre in Japan. In search of 
mayo-free Japanese food, I went to the takoyaki (fried octopus) 
stand. Relieved, I watched them grilling those delicious 
purple tentacles, mixing in spices, and  oh no  adding 
mayonnaise.
I wondered, will this reign of terror ever end? I went back to 
my host family and confronted my host father, who was, at the
moment, building terraces of mayo on his pork cutlet.
Why? I asked, and I could almost see a glimmer of that 
eggy-white substance I so dearly despise in his eyes.
"Well, dont Americans like mayonnaise? he asked. "You like 
mayo, dont you?
Ah, and there is the rub. The Japanese already don't use that 
many sauces, unlike Americans, where it seems like a sauce 
or condiment must be present at every table. In Japan, there 
are essentially three sauces for meat: donkatsu sauce (which 
is, literally, pork sauce), Worcester sauce, and mayonnaise. In 
America, however, there seems to be a sauce for every meal: A1 
for steak, gravy for turkey, tartar sauce for fish, barbeque sauce 
for chicken, and mustard and ketchup for hot dogs and burgers. 
Unlike the Japanese, Americans hardly ever consume meat 
without sauce. In Japan, if a food doesnt work with donkatsu, 
Worcester, or mayo, it is served with no sauce at all. Primarily, 
the Japanese eat fish, and if you were to suggest any sauce 
besides, well, nothing, they would look at you funny; sauces are 
reserved for Western-type food (a.k.a. "not fish").
If you like your tartar sauce, I suggest you leave it at home in 
America  but if you like mayonnaise, you would definitely 
enjoy a visit to Japan. There's an entire pile of mayo I scraped 
off my burgers just for you.

Avenue Q comes to Pittsburgh
Show combines the best of Sesame Street and Rent
Some gloriously drunk night, Sesame Street and Rent did 
it like rabbits and produced a bizarre but brilliant love child 
named Avenue Q. Like Rent, Avenue Q explores the joys and 
tragedies of a bunch of penniless twentysomethings living 
together in the less fashionable part of New York City. Unlike 
Rent, nobody in Avenue Q has AIDS, nobody dies, and half 
the characters are Muppet-like puppets. Channeling Sesame 
Street, Avenue Q shares the shows joy, multicultural cast, 
and animated skits (played on plasma screens that drop 
down from the sky). And, of course, there's the singing and 
dancing. But Avenue Q is far more than a combination of two 
very different shows  its a brilliant satire, a remarkable 
achievement of puppeteering, and a superb musical. As 
part of the shows Broadway tour, the puppets and their 
counterparts rode into Pittsburgh Thanksgiving week.
As the show begins, the puppets seem a bit strange. When 
idealistic, wet-behind-the-fuzzy-ears college graduate 
Princeton first walks onstage with puppeteer Robert McClure 
to sing "What Do You Do with a B.A. in English, its hard 
to know who to watch  the puppet or the puppeteer. Its 
disconcerting that, essentially, two actors are playing each 
part. But by the time the cast has swung into the second 
song, If You Were Gay," the audience has had time to adjust.
This unique duality might detract from the puppets' impact 
under lesser puppeteers, but Avenue Qs non-furry cast 
members are excellent in their task. The puppeteers of 
Avenue Q are not just the men and women behind the curtain
 they are extensions of their puppets personas. To this end,
the puppeteers act as much as the puppets; when Princeton 
flirts with Kate Monster, for example, their puppeteers make 
goo-goo eyes as well. Since the puppets end at the waist, 
their puppeteers must sometimes fill in as the legs; when Kelli 
Sawyer was giving life to Lucy the Slut, her swaying hips 
became Lucy's.
The play centers around Princeton, who has just moved to 
Avenue Q after discovering that he can't afford rent anywhere 
else. He soon meets his neighbors  failed stand-up comic 
Brian (Cole Porter) and his Japanese fiance Christmas Eve 
(Angela Ai); polar opposite roommates Rod and Nicky, notso-subtly based on Sesame Street's Bert and Ernie (Robert 
McClure and David Benoit); porn-obsessed Trekkie Monster 
(also David Benoit); and landlord Gary Coleman.
Downsized before starting the job that brought him to New 
York, Princeton struggles to figure out his purpose in life. But 
he soon discovers hes not the only one with problems: Brian 
is unemployed, and Christmas Eve, a psychiatrist, cant get 
any clients because of her Japanese accent. Kate Monster 
is not only perpetually single, but she has also given up on 
her lifelong dream to start a special school just for monsters. 
Rod, a Republican investment banker, is trapped in the 
closet, hiding a secret love for his straight roommate Nicky. 
And aging child star Gary Coleman left his fame and fortune 
behind in the 80s.
The choice of using Gary Coleman  a real person  is 
a bit odd, especially as it is the only thing (at least until
The scoop on JUPE
A look behind one of the South Sides newest boutiques
Its hard to miss the distinctive Victorian architecture that 
characterizes the historic business district of East Carson 
Street, across the Monongahela River from campus. Tucked 
away near the Birmingham Bridge is a small building with a 
painted blue exterior  JUPE boutique.
Jupe means skirt" in French, and the simply decorated 
boutique lives up to its name  carrying a number of 
skirts, in addition to jeans, sweaters, jackets, shoes, and 
jewelery. JUPE has fans in all age groups, though it started 
out targeting a college crowd, aiming to provide affordable 
yet exquisite choices to Pittsburghs large population of 
college students and young professionals. This intention is 
evident in the lines the store carries, from the comfortable 
brown Seychelles boots that can easily be worn to class, to 
Pittsburgh native Julia Di Nardo's line Neighborhood Teaze, 
featuring T-shirts with inscriptions like "Oakland: CAUTION 
Student crossing since 1787.
The owners of JUPE considered Shadyside and even the 
suburbs as possible locations for the store, which opened 
a little more than a year ago, but settled on the South Side, 
inspired by the emerging SouthSide Works down the road. 
Pittsburgh is beneficial because it is a city with a small-town 
feel and things are relatively inexpensive, co-owner Amanda
Hall said. Still, the road to opening a boutique was not easy. 
Co-owner Cara Moody had just left a design job in New York 
to work as a stylist at Little Black Dress in Shadyside.
Moody and Hall worked to raise funds on their own; those, 
along with a strong business plan, assistance from friends, 
and a bank loan, provided the foundation for the boutique. "(It 
was like getting] a mini-MBA: We did a lot of research at the 
library and the Small Business Administration," Hall said.
Hall, with a background in advertising, and Moody, a 
graduate of fashion design school in Paris, had one thing in 
common: They wanted to bring more affordable chic fashion 
to Pittsburgh. As for tastes in fashion, those are often less 
than similar. I am more conservative, I love brands, Hall said. 
"While Cara is more about fit and design, I like things that are 
more basic.
The co-owners' different fashion preferences are evident in 
the boutique. This season, the stores selection includes shift 
dresses; silver, metallic items; high-waist denims; origamitype jackets; and chunky sweaters with lantern sleeves. Most 
items could be pared down for everyday wear or spiced up 
with jewelry for a great night out. Hall said, It's hard to be a 
buyer because everyone is so different; sometimes we buy

Sesame Street is canceled) that dates the musical. (The real 
Gary Coleman is less-than-pleased by his appearance in 
the script.) Other than that, Avenue Q is about as close to a 
perfect piece of musical comedy as you can get. The songs 
are all hit-worthy, the Sesame Street satire is clever without 
overpowering the plot, and the choreography is spot-on; the 
dialogue sent audience members of all ages roaring.
Almost all of the actors in the tour cast also played on 
Broadway, and all of them were brilliant. Angela Ai was 
absurdly hilarious as a walking Asian stereotype, and the 
puppeteers who gave life to Princeton and Kate Monster were 
especially expressive. All the puppeteers portrayed more than 
one character, and each moved seamlessly from role to role.
Avenue Q is proof that sharp young minds can still create 
magic on Broadway. The musical is on tour until August 2008, 
and its still on Broadway  not as easy as turning on Sesame 
Street, but definitely more fun. Dont bring your littlest 
cousins, though  the show does feature full puppet nudity.

stuff we don't like. To Hall, their diversity of opinions also 
reflects the market: CMU tends to be more fashion-forward 
while Pitt is safe, she said. Retail is about knowing your 
market."
An understanding of the Pittsburgh market and customers 
has been a key element to JUPEs success. The social nature 
of Pittsburgh residents has been helpful to the business. 
People here are really friendly  they want to tell people they 
bought a great shirt," Hall said. Hall and Moody take their 
customers opinions very seriously. One of their best-selling 
purses, a silver quilted bag with a Chanel feel, was added to 
the store through a suggestion from a customer.
The boutique has been very successful, and Hall reports 
that sales have been up 50 percent this year. While Hall and 
Moody are still working hard to stay on top of the fashion 
community in Pittsburgh, they have great dreams for the 
future of the company. "Cara wants to start her own line,
Hall said. We want to work more with labels to design for us. 
Down the road that's what we want."

A bigger Frame
Carnegie Mellons growing student gallery
. The students behind The Frame are looking to broaden 
the gallerys horizons. Co-directors Michael McParlane and 
Amy Johnson would like to diversify both the art and the 
artists; they want to include the work of students outside 
of the School of Art (and outside of Carnegie Mellon), in 
addition to incorporating events like contests, concerts, and 
theater performances. "We really want it to be a place to be 
interdisciplinary, said Johnson, a School of Ait alum.
And The Frame gallery is well on its way. Several of the 
exhibits this semester were from students outside of 
the School of Art or involved mixed media, according to 
McParlane, a senior BHA student. I feel like anyone who 
hasn't used the space to put up paintings or put up sculpture 
has done [mixed media], he said. Additionally, The Frame 
has hosted performances by local bands, in addition to one 
appearance by the Pittsburgh Ballet.
To raise money and attract interest, McParlane and Johnson 
plan to hold contests and other fundraising events next 
semester. Though they receive some funding from Carnegie 
Mellon, the co-directors are on their own when it comes to 
organizing events. It's all student-run, McParlane said. We
dont get any help from the school. Theyve akeady had a 
rummage sale, hut the two are most excited about a team art 
contest to be held in January. The teams will have to pay a 
registration fee, and then create an impromptu work of art in a 
short amount of time. Johnson said that he and McParlane are 
also open to student suggestions for fundraising.
Were trying to raise money to make the basement a 
workable space, Johnson said. Working with the basement, 
along with other aspects of the gallery, McParlane and 
Johnson are hoping to make The Frame into not just a gallery, 
but a performance and lounge space as well.
Overall, the co-directors proposed changes aim to benefit 
both the artists themselves and visitors to the gallery. In 
addition to showing art, The Frame aims to help artists learn 
how to show their art. We want to have really great shows, 
but we also want to prepare people for the art world, Johnson 
said.

School of Drama performs Guys and Dolls
Director Steve Cosson updates classic musical
The School of Drama opened its winter musical Guys and 
Dolls this past Thursday with fantastic results. Though most 
audiences are familiar with Guys and Dolls, the Carnegie 
Mellon adaptation was completely fresh.
The Carnegie Mellon actors and actresses made the 
characters completely their own; the character of Adelaide, 
played by senior drama major Emily Rossell, stood out in 
particular. Rossell portrayed the often-exaggerated character 
as hysterical yet truly endearing; the audience loved her, as 
did the other players on stage. The choreography, particularly 
in the number "Luck Be a Lady, was outstanding. The male 
chorus, made up of the criminal craps-shooters, performed 
a sophisticated and modern dance routine that included 
everything from ballet to break dancing. One of the more 
dexterous men flew across the stage in a front handspring, 
luring the audience into applause and cheers. And if the 
acting and dancing were not enough, the ethereal voices 
of senior drama majors Jessica Waxman and Robert Lenzi, 
playing the leads of Miss Sarah Brown and Sky Masterson, 
sang wonderful renditions of composer Frank Loessers 
melodious and well-known songs.
The musical follows professional gamblers in 1930s New York 
City. When a group of high rollers comes into town, Nathan 
Detroit (drama student Ben Goldberg), the head honcho of the 
New York craps game, wants to organize a game. In order to 
secure a place to play the game, Detroit must pay the owner 
of the Biltmore Hotel Garage $1000 in advance.
Unable to come up with the money on his own, Detroit bets 
fellow gambler Sky Masterson one grand that Masterson
cannot bring a girl of Detroits choosing to dinner with him in 
Havana, Cuba that night. After Masterson agrees to the bet, 
Detroit chooses Miss Sarah Brown, a local missionary and 
well-known prude. What ensues over the next two hours is 
a love story in classical musical theater fashion. Masterson 
must find a way to lure the conservative Sarah Brown offshore 
for dinner, despite their opposite lifestyles and moral values.
In a parallel love story,' Detroit, who has been engaged for 14 
years to Adelaide, a singer at the Hot Box club, must keep 
his relationship together and appease Adelaide's persistent 
nagging to elope.
The second act opens with the Hot Box singers performance 
of "Take Back Your Mink, a sexy number that flaunts the 
singers vocal chords... in addition to other body parts.
Truly, the peripheral characters steal the second act. Arvide 
Abernathy (School of Drama course assistant Tristan 
Farmer), the grandfather to Sarah Brown, plays a convincing 
80-something-year-old man, melting the audience during 
the song he sings to Sarah, More I Cannot Wish You. In 
Sit Down You're Rockin The Boat, Nicely Nicely Johnson 
(senior drama student Barrett Davis) shows his charismatic 
side, re-enacting a dream he had about being on the boat 
to heaven; at the same time, General Matilda B. Cartwright 
(junior musical theater major Laura Mixon), the head 
missionary for the city, beats a tamborine while singing high 
enough to break glass.
Guy and Dolls is an American musical theater classic, and 
even if you have seen it once before (or several times), 
Carnegie Mellons production is not one to be missed. Director 
Steve Cosson breathes fresh air into the well-known script.
One of my goals in this production was to support the 
actors in their creation of fully realized characters, Cosson 
wrote in an e-mail. Its still in the style of a musical comedy, 
but I believe the actors were very successful at basing 
their performances in the truth of their roles. They created 
characters as opposed to caricatures, and I was delighted to 
see that.
In addition to their talent, Cosson recognized his cast's 
commitment to their work. The CMU actors are impressive 
on many levels, from their technical expertise to their 
stamina  putting together a full musical in the midst of a full 
schedule of classes is no small feat, wrote Cosson, also the 
founding artistic director of Obie-winning New York theater 
group The Civilians, "but I was particularly impressed by their 
enthusiasm and generosity. Something I love about young 
actors is their willingness to just jump in feet first and commit 
to what theyre doing.
Overall, the show was a wonderful success and 
accomplishment for the School of Drama and Carnegie Mellon 
in general  a Broadway-quality show for a quarter of the 
price. If it's possible to look up from your textbooks during 
finals preparation, considering using that free time to see 
Guys and Dolls.

Scotch n Soda adapts McDonaghs dark play
Scotch 'n' Soda performed playwright Martin McDonagh's 
dark play The Pillowman at the end of last week for a total 
of three satisfactory performances. The play, directed by 
first-year drama major Lillian DeRitter, was super-stylized and 
elegant, if at times more comedic than intended.
The Pillowman focuses on a writer named Katurian after his 
arrest. In the play, Katurian is taken in for questioning*by 
the police; his stories, many of which end with the deaths 
of children, begin to come true in a series of grisly murders. 
The police also question his brother Michal, who is mentally 
unstable due to unjust experimentation.
In Scotch 'n' Sodas performance, the lead siblings change 
from brothers to sisters, played by first-year H&SS student 
Ellene Mobbs and sophomore creative and professional 
writing major Elyssa Goodman. The casting for the play 
was gender-blind; actors auditioned for every character, 
experimenting with mixes of male and female siblings and 
cops. Eventually Scotch 'n' Soda settled on female siblings 
and male cops. Elyssas reading of Michal ended up defining 
Michal for me, DeRitter stated in an e-mail. "In my opinion, 
Katurian is more of a catalyst than a main character, so 
finding a Katurian and Michal that worked together was 
crucial."
As the audience entered Rangos, Katurian (Mobbs) sat 
blindfolded in a chair, setting the awkward scene of onlookers 
witnessing torture. The set, made of two large white boxes 
able to move to create new settings, allowed for video to 
be projected as visual representations of Katurians stories.
It could expand to become the questioning room or shrink 
to become the bedroom of Katurians childhood. Thus, the 
set was purely utilitarian, which emphasized the setting of 
authoritarian society. The monochromatic palate worked 
wonders in this respect because it established an unfeeling, 
foreign space immediately that could be transformed into 
a sparse, uncomfortable bedroom for the tortured child that 
was Katurian," DeRitter said. "The screens worked beautifully
I think, because what is storytelling if not revealing secrets 
then covering them up again?"
The technical aspects of the show were all outstandingly 
executed. There were a few difficulties with placement of 
the projectors for the video, but all of the behind-the-scenes 
work was accomplished well. The set was beautiful and well 
constructed, emblematic of the entire play. The lighting felt 
deliberate and stark, like being watched.
The acting was also satisfying, although sometimes a bit 
over the top. While DeRitter encouraged the audience to 
laugh if they ever felt awkward from the tense moments of 
the play, some unsuccessfully stifled laughter came from 
accidentally comic moments. But most of the laughter came 
from truly funny performances, like Tupolski (junior computer 
science and philosophy major Daniel Dewey), a man almost 
matter-of-factly cruel. Though his character did not appear for 
an entire act, he managed to hang over the rest of the place; 
his presence was sorely missed in scenes where he left the 
room. As Katurian is investigated by Deweys detective and 
cop Ariel (sophomore computer science major Matt Goldfarb), 
the audience learned about these characters as well, through 
the personal details they let slip during the interrogation.
As Katurian's sister, the mentally challenged Michal, 
Goodman shone portraying what his brother Katurian called 
a "pervert." Though it might seem that Michals childish 
giggle would start to annoy more than amuse, Goodmans 
unwavering portrayal kept things under control. Both Dewey 
and Goodman were hilarious, making up for other sagging 
areas of the cast.

Howard Mincone, a professional entertainer from Talent Network, 
Inc., performs at Carnegie Mellon's first Madrigal Dinner since 2000. 
The event was thoroughly medieval, from the costumes to the cast of 
characters  a King, Queen, court, and even a royal bagpiper. Once 
a beloved university tradition, the Madrigal Dinner fell by the wayside 
to make room for Student Affairs' Winter Gala. For a full article on the 
dinner, see page 5.
