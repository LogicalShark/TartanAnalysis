Make the University Center number one priority
President Richard Cyert 
pulled off the biggest PR coup 
of his 17 years as this Uni
versitys chief executive offi
cer last Friday in the Wherrett Room.
Facing a hostile audience, 
the president, in a rare show 
of aggression, numbed the 
SRO crowd with distorted 
numbers and the usual hol
low promises. However, the 
bottom line is the same: The 
University Center, as The 
Tartan reported three weeks 
ago, has been postponed inA Tartan Editorial
definitely.
Along with the other stu
dent leaders on campus, we at 
The Tartan consider the Uni
versity Center the number one 
priority for the current and 
future administrations. Nor
mally, we reserve our opinion 
for the editorial pages.
This issue is too important 
to bury.
The University Center would
provide central meeting 
places, student organization 
offices, and a focal point for 
campus recreational and so
cial activities.
To maintain our standing as 
a top university, we must put 
our energies toward this cen
ter. We must make the Uni
versity Center our first prior
ity in fundraisingsomething 
the current administration 
appears unwilling to do.
For example, Cyert, CMUs 
best fundraiser, admits that 
potential donors are solicited
for funds for the capital cam
paign rather than for the Uni
versity Center. Only $500,000 
has been raised in three years 
specifically for the center.
In his speech Friday, Cyert 
implied that the University 
was meeting its fundraising 
goals. He did this by carefully 
lumping the University Cen
ter and the East Campus proj
ect together under an umbrella 
headingcalled the University 
Center Complex.
This $70 million complex is 
made up of the East Campus
project ($35 million) and the 
University Center ($35 mil
lion). Because the East Cam
pus project is already paid for, 
Cyert can rightfully claim that 
50 percent of the Complex is 
paid for without mentioning 
the University Center.
Three weeks ago, The Tar
tan wrote that the Center had 
been postponed indefinitely 
due to a lack of funds. Friday, 
Cyert admitted that the ad
ministration would not set a 
date to begin construction until 
the end of the capital cam
paign in 1991 which is later 
than had been anticipated. 
To us, thats a fairly conser
vative interpretation of 
postponed indefinitely. 
Were tired of PR; its time 
the University realigned its 
priorities. As Cyert said 
Fi-iday, [T]he faculty, staff, 
students, administration, 
and trustees must be united 
in purpose and direction. 
Its time the University 
starts practicing what it 
preaches from its sixth floor 
Warner Hall pulpit.

By DUSTIN FRAZIER
Tartan Managing Editor
Carnegie Mellon President Richard Cyert 
and University of Pittsburgh President 
Wesley Posvar helped announce the acqui
sition of the new Cray YMP supercomputer 
by the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center 
last week. As the first non-government 
installation of a YMP to date, the new sys
tem represents a major step in the exten
sion of supercomputing power to educa
tional and corporate users.
The announcement came as part of a 
demonstration and press conference at the 
Westinghouse Energy Center Tuesday. 
Cyert and Posvar joined PSC Executive 
Director Beverly Clayton in announcing the 
installation of the new supercomputer, and 
both presidents offered insights into the 
types of projects for which their university 
researchers use the centers facilities.
Westinghouse has purchased the lesspowerful Cray XMP which the center used 
for the past two and a half years.
According to Cyert, supercomputing will 
become increasingly important in the de
velopment of new scientific theories and 
discoveries here in the United States. Dur
ing his segment of the presentation he said, 
The important point for this center is that 
we are here, really, to advance science. The 
advancement in science is crucial to the 
long-run health of the nation. It is my view 
that the nation which is going to be able to 
do research on a significant scale and build 
up a pool of knowledge out of which we can 
transfer technology to commercial opera
tions is going to be the country that, for the 
long-run, is the international leader in 
trade.

funding approval from the National Science 
Foundation, making it the fifth such super

In a week marked with resolu
tions, a petition, and anonymous 
postering, student leaders expressed 
virtually unanimous dismay at the 
administrations decision to delay 
construction of the proposed Uni
versity Center, and demanded that 
higher priority be given to raising 
funds for the project.
The University Center figures 
prominently in the campus master 
plan, which includes the East Cam
pus project currently under construc
tion. Its goal is to unite the student 
body by providing a common gather
ing area for recreational and social 
activities as well as increased space 
for activity offices.
In late 1987 the Task Force Report 
on the Quality of Student Life sup
ported the Center as a major effort 
to improve the quality of student life 
at CMU. The protraction of this 
project will have a chilling effect on 
all other steps ... that are taken to 
enable Carnegie Mellon to reflect
the virtually limitless potential of 
its constituency, it said.
Three weeks ago, The Tartan 
reported that the University Center 
had been postponed indefinitely 
due to a lack of funds for the project, 
expected to cost at least $30 million.
In an address to the student body 
last Friday, President Richard Cyert 
claimed that it was not accurate 
that the student center had been 
postponed indefinitely, but admit
ted that the administration would 
not decide on a date to begin con
struction until the end of the capital 
campaign in 1991.
Hes leaving the new president in 
a situation to evaluate what the next 
step will be, Vice President for 
University Relations Don Hale told 
The Tartan.-It hasnt been post
poned  I dont know that anybody 
ever had a definite date [for begin
ning construction of the University 
Center];
Student leaders were to have met 
yesterday to discuss further student 
action on the issue, according to Stu
dent Government President Andy
Robitshek. Well decide what to do, 
and that may range from nothing to a 
week-long protest, he said.
Last week activities began with a 
petition written by Robitshek and 
Senator Carlos Franco. The petition 
was first circulated at the Tuesday 
Senate meeting, where, said Franco, 
a majority of Senators signed it.
The Robitshek/Franco petition 
stated that By pushing the date of 
construction [of the University Cen
ter] back five to six years, the admini
stration is making a statement that 
the quality of life is no longer a top 
priority.
The petition demanded that the 
administration make the student 
center its top priority, and, if necesr 
sary, withdraw money from the en
dowment and establish student user 
fees to allow construction to begin as 
soon as possible. Robitshek estimated 
that 400 students had signed the 
petition by press time on Sunday.
Franco also introduced a stronglyworded resolution to Senate Tuesday 
asking that the Cyert administracontinued on page 5

Despite its 74-year history of being re
stricted to the CFA community, the Beaux 
Arts Ball committee is considering open
ing the Ball to the whole campus. It is 
scheduled for March 20 at Metropol and 
tickets are on sale in Skibo and at the 
Information Desk for $30.
According to Troy Lambert, the commit
tees chair and a senior art major, the 
decision to open the Ball will either be 
made tomorrow or Thursday depending 
on the number of tickets his committee is 
able to sell. He said that 600 tickets have 
to be sold to break even.
Im not really for [opening the Ball], 
said Lambert. But its another thing we 
have to do to have the Ball. In past weeks, 
the committee has postponed the Ball and
then moved it off campus after it had been 
cancelled by the administration.
When it was cancelled, the administra
tion was worried about underage drink
ing, drug use, and property damage  
problems at 1985s Ball in the CFA build
ing. As a result, the Ball was moved to 
Metropol, an industrial dance club in the 
Strip District, where alcohol could be 
controlled and the Universitys responsi
bility could be diminished.
With the move, however, the Ball had to 
be re-scheduled for a Monday night and 
the price had to be increased to $30 per 
ticket with a cash bar. These changes, 
along with the off-campus location, are 
expected to reduce the turnout of CFA 
students, faculty, staff, and alumni.
Also, because of these last-minute 
changes, only alumni living in the East 
have been formally invited to the event, so
fewer alumni than normal are expected to  
attend this year.
Brad Walter, Dean of Student Affairs, ^ 
thinks enough tickets will be sold. I just " 
think the Beaux Arts Ball committee is  
being overly pessimistic. The only thing.;.; 
different about this years event is the..', 
lack of CFA alumni support.
However, if enough tickets are not sold, , 
the Ball will opened to the rest of the 
campus. At this point, I just want people  
to come to the Ball, said Jill Ruby, a 
senior design major and member of the 
Beaux Arts committee.
Other than that decision, preparations ; 
appear to be on schedule. Everything is a 
pretty much set except for the decorations" 
and written contracts for the bands, said 
Lambert.
At press time, Lambert said he had

TOKYO (AP)A strong earth
quake with a preliminary Richter 
scale reading of 6.0 jolted central 
Japan late last Monday, but there 
were no immediate reports of 
damage or casualties.
At Choshi, on the Pacific coast

rocked buildings in Tokyo for 
about one minute. In Tokyo, 
Yokohama, and other nearby cit

Senate rejects 
Tower, 53-47
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Senate, by a vote of 53-47, re
jected the nomination of John 
Tower as defense secretary on 
Thursday.
The rejection, the first of a 
cabinet nominee in 30 years, was 
widely anticipated following a 
negative vote in the Senate Armed 
Services Committee last month.
Tower, a former Texas senator 
and U.S. arms negotiator, was 
widely criticized for alleged alco
hol abuse, inappropriate dealings 
with women, and improper ap
pearances of his dealings with 
defense contractors.
The Senate vote against John
Towers confirmation as defense 
secretary was primarily along 
party lines, with the majority 
Democrats voting against the 
nomination and the minority 
Republicans voting for it.
Three Democrats - Lloyd 
Bentsen of Texas, Christopher 
Dodd of Connecticut, and Howell 
Heflin of Alabama - joined the 
Republicans to support Tower, 
while Kansas Nancy Kassebaum 
was the lone GOP senator to break 
ranks.
It was only the ninth time in 
200 years that the Senate has 
voted to reject a presidents Cabi
net choice and the only time it has 
done so early in a new admini
stration.
Senators from both parties cred
ited Towers defeat to the decision
to oppose him made by Sen. Sam 
Nunn (D-Ga.) chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee.
On Friday Bush nominated Rep. 
Richard Cheney (R-Wyo.) as his 
new choice for defense secretary.
Congress may up 
minimum wage
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Senate Labor Committee voted 
11-5 Thursday to boost the feder
ally set minimum wage to $4.65 
an hour from $3.35 an hour over 
three years. On Friday a House 
panel approved virtually identi
cal legislation and advanced 
Democratic plans to take the first 
increase in the minimum wage 
since 1981 to the floors of both 
houses within two weeks.
The bill would also increase the 
tax credit given to restaurants 
and other employers whose work
ers receive tips, and would 
pand the small-business exemp
tion from the minimum-wage 
requirement.
The vote came after the com
mittee rejected a Bush admini
stration proposal for a three-year 
increase to $4.25 an hour with 
lower six-month training wage 
for persons hired in new jobs.
President Bush has indicated 
he would veto the committee bill.

Delta Upsilon readies three-wheeler while it appeals decision
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffwriter
It appears the days of two-wheel 
buggies are over at CMU. Despite an 
appeal by Delta Upsilon, the recent 
decision made by Sweepstakes Chair 
Chris Hansen and the Sweepstakes 
Advisory Committee will stand, pro
hibiting the buggies from racing.
In a directive issued by Hansen on 
January 30, two-wheel buggies were 
banned from participation in Sweep
stakes. Delta Upsilon, in turn, ap
pealed this ruling in a proposal sent 
to Hansen on February 3. In its 
appeal, DU asked that its buggy team 
at least be allowed to roll in an exhi
bition heat on April 14, remaining
ineligible for a trophy. We wanted 
one last chance to prove ourselves, 
said DU buggy chairman David 
Smith, and they wouldnt let us do 
that.
Last year, DUs two-wheel buggy 
King Eider rolled a then-course rec
ord of 2:08.5 in the preliminary heat; 
unfortunately for the house, how
ever, it tangled with Beta's Chal
lenger in the finals and quashed DUs 
hopes of a trophy.
Director of Student Activities Anne 
Witchner said that the committees 
concern is over the safety of twowheel buggies. Weve always felt 
that they were unsafe and we tried to 
come up with a ruling, but we were 
unable to in the past. Additionally,
she said, The other organizations 
expressed concerns about rolling 
against DU.
Their argument is that safety is 
more important than being fair, said 
Smith. My problem with that is that 
theres been no objective measure
ment of our safety. As far as statis
tics, the number of incidents weve 
had based on the number of rolls 
weve had, were as safe than many 
other organizations. Give us any 
reasonable test and well pass it. 
DUs original plan was to build a 
duplicate of King Eider, which was 
stolen over last summer. The Janu
ary 30 ruling banning two-wheeled 
buggies, unfortunately, came after 
DU had already obtained the neces
sary materials and parts with which 
to do so. According to Smith, the 
house is left in a difficult situation 
with regard to this years competi
tion, now less than five weeks away.
DU plans to continue to appeal the 
decision but is nonetheless readying 
a three-wheel buggy to insure its 
participation. I havent given up on 
two-wheelers, said Smith. But well 
work with what we have.
Reaction from the rest of the house 
seems to echo Smiths position. This 
puts our program back a few years,5* 
said sophomore DU member Chetan 
Balachandra, but we have confi
dence in our pushers and in their 
ability, so were just trying to get 
something to roll on race day.

asked to be removed from the 
tenure track. He has continued to 
teach with an appointment as a

Alieva said that he removed 
himself from the tenure track

the kind of time and energy into 
research that it requires and still 
be as committed to teaching as I 
wanted to be. At that time, he

research, and CMU doesnt want 
him to teach here. She said that 
an untenured position with a 
ridiculous contract wasnt a good 
solution, either.
Linda Peters, a senior majoring 
in Graphic Design and one of the 
organizers of the letter writing 
campaign, said that she first found 
out about Alievas situation in 
October. At that point, she de
cided that she wanted to take 
action. At the beginning of the 
spring semester, she asked Al
ieva if he would object to the let
ter writing campaign. She said 
that students began by asking 
people in his classes to write let
ters in support of retaining Al
ieva, and that they soon expanded 
their efforts to students who had 
been taught by Alieva in previous 
years.
Peters said that she, along with 
senior Victoria Lees, approached 
Philosophy Department Head 
Clark Glymour, H&SS Dean 
Stephen Fienberg, Provost Angel 
Iordan, and finally President
iyert. While each of them gave
her a positive response, only 
President Cyert promised that 
he would act upon the matter.
Peters believes that [This] is a 
good step, but nothing is really 
clear yet. Its a positive step to
wards teaching positions being 
available. However, she ex
pressed concern that other teach
ers in the University may not be 
able to place the emphasis on 
teaching that they would like to.
Indeed, the Alieva situation has 
raised many questions about the 
importance of teaching to the 
University. According to Associ
ate Professor of Philosophy 
Preston Covey, the real issue 
being raised by the case is 
whether or not the University 
can or cannot have one or two 
people in each department whose 
purpose is to pay attention to 
students and to concentrate on 
teaching. Covey is also the direc
tor of the Center for the Design of 
Educational Computing and of the 
Center for Advancement of Ap
plied Ethics.
In a letter to the editor of The 
Pittsburgh Press on January 9, 
English professor Thomas Huckin 
said that although university 
guidelines state that one can be 
awarded tenure for outstanding 
teaching, the track record says 
otherwise. Citing the grants, 
prizes, industry support, media 
attention, and promotion and 
tenure that go to faculty mem
bers who research, he claimed 
good teaching gains none of these 
rewards.... In the unspoken value 
system of prestige-conscious uni
versities like CMU, teaching is a 
distinctly minor concern.
The Faculty Handbook explains 
that tenure is awarded based on 
two criteria: teaching and edu
cational activities; and research, 
scholarly, or artistic activities ... 
It goes on to say that tenure is

a contract extension by President Cyert. 
Virtually all of Alievas students say 
hes an exceptional teacher.
awarded to faculty who are out
standing, or show promise of 
becoming outstanding, in at least 
one of the two ... and are at least 
competent in the other.
H&SS Dean Fienberg said that 
he thought the criteria were very 
good. He said that he realized 
that a different combination of 
research and teaching was neces
sary for each faculty member, but 
that one hundred percent of one 
aiid"zero [percent] of the other 
was not acceptable.
Fienberg pointed out that none 
of the purely-research appoint
ments within the University carry 
tenure. He said such appoint
ments are funded from outside 
the University and that its rare 
for such outside funds to be avail
able for teaching positions. 
Regarding the Universitys 
commitment to teaching, Fien
berg said that the University as 
well as each college has awards 
that are presented to faculty in 
which teaching is one of the criteria. He also said that special 
faculty appointments do ex
ist that allow more time to be 
spent on teaching because 
they spend less time at the 
administrative duties of ten
ured faculty.
Mark Stehlik, associate di
rector of the Introductory Pro
gramming Group in the 
School of Computer Science, 
described the special faculty 
teaching appointments that 
exist for the introductory level 
courses in programming. 
Faculty appointed to these 
positions are non-tenured lec
turers who emphasize teach
ing.
Two years ago, Stehlik ex
plained, Phil Miller, the di
rector of the Intro Group, 
proposed that the lecturers in 
the group take turns at 
doing research so that each of 
them would have some hands-on 
experience in the field that could 
enhance what they were doing in 
classroom by increasing the 
breadth of their experience.
Stehlik noted that the mem
bers of the Intro Group have 
appointments that dont require 
any research. The abilities to 
communicate knowledge are more 
important than research abilities 
in courses at the freshman and 
sophomore level in computer sci
ence as well as any discipline, 
said Stehlik. Courses at that level 
are primarily concerned with re
lating technical information about 
the discipline to a non-technical 
audience.... Facts about any field 
are technical to anyone whos not 
majoring in [that field].
Stehlik said that there are 
appointments of research faculty 
and special [teaching] faculty 
because there are two different 
sets of skills that a person in a 
field might have: the ability to see
and act upon key insights thats 
needed for research, and the abil
ity to dynamically communicate 
information thats needed in 
teaching.
Regarding positions that em
phasize teaching in the Univer
sity, he said, If we cant afford to 
have someone whos solely 
charged with the educating stu
dents, we should question the 
purpose of why were in a univer
sity setting.
Alieva agreed that research is 
important to quality education at 
some levels. He also pointed out 
that many things contributing to 
a quality undergraduate educa
tion arent tied in at the research 
level.
Alieva acknowledged problems 
in evaluating the performance and 
scholarly activities of faculty 
members. If theyre publishing, 
he explained, you have to be sure 
that what theyre publishing is 
related to what theyre doing. If 
theyre not publishing, you have 
even less of an indicator of what 
activities theyre involved with.
Alieva sees commitment to re
search as pulling people and re
sources in one direction. Research, 
he said, takes time away from 
both teaching and advising.
Alieva pointed out that other 
schools on the level of CMU have 
different approaches to under
graduate teaching. He cites Co
lumbia Universitys Columbia 
College, in New York, where core 
courses are taught in small sec
tions of twenty people. Aside from 
the English department, said 
Alieva, there is no real equiva
lent at CMU.
Alieva suggested that CMU 
demonstrate its commitment to 
teaching by trying to provide 
everyone with some smaller 
courses, like maybe a freshman 
seminar, and by setting up some
system of non-tenured but re
newable faculty appointments. ;
Regarding the current possibil
ity of gaining tenure through 
excellence in teaching, Allev 
said, Insofar as theres this other 
possibility of excellence in teach
ing and competence as a re
searcher, there dont seem to be 
many people who have been 
granted tenure on such a basis. In 
general, I think that faculty arent 
well aware of precisely what th 
criteria are for satisfying that 
other option.... As far as I know, 
there has been little institutional 
encouragement to pursue that 
option. He also offered that the 
University may be reconsidering 
its position, judging by its actioi) 
in my specific case.
Student response to the Alieva 
situation seems overwhelmingly 
to support retaining Alieva and 
others like him. IM freshman 
Evan Engler feels that the Uni
versity has as much if not more of 
an obligation to undergraduat 
education as it does to researchl 
He said that there seems to be  
need for special faculty who are 
primarily concerned with under* 
graduate education just as ther$ 
is a need for faculty who are prif 
marily concerned with research^
Several students pointed out 
that Alieva shows that kind of 
concern. Ernie is one of the mosl 
inspirational professors I ever 
had, says H&SS junior Davie) 
Gantshar. On most of the papery 
that Ernie has returned to me, h^ 
has made comments that wer^ 
longer than the paper itself. !
IM senior Tom Fernandez says 
that the most remarkable thin^ 
about Professor Alieva is the great 
deal of care he shows for individJ( 
ual students. Fernandez saic( 
that Alieva has a special capabil-j 
ity of motivating students to thinkj 
critically.

How do you feel about the delay of the University Center?
Nothing on this campus is 
centralized, and having a 
entralized student center is 
something thats pretty basic 
to any mainstream, prestig
ious university. The school is 
always wondering why the 
jtudents arent happy here, 
ind one of the main reasons is 
hat they dont cater to the 
leeds of the students.
 Nicole Austin 
Senior, Applied History
I dont know anything about 
the University Center, but if 
[Cyert] is going to postpone it, 
thats not what I want him to 
do. Id like to see the student 
center go up while Im still 
here. Whats the problem?
 Carolyn Woyciesjes 
Freshman, Art
I think its a really sad 
thing. When I first got ac
cepted here, it was a big thing 
that there was no student 
center.
 Susan Quigley 
Sophomore, Writing
I thought that [the stu
dent center] was one of their 
big things to encourage stu
dents to come here, and now 
most of us wont ever even 
see it. I think its pretty 
cheap.
 Meredith McNeill 
Freshman, H&SS
I dont know. Its kind of 
ironic the way CMU seems 
like such a patch-up univer
sity. Whenever theres a prob
lem, they just patch it up tem
porarily. Now that theyre 
building some things that are 
going to stay, it seems like 
theyre dropping all their 
plans.
 Francois Guilleux 
Sophomore, English/ 
Psychology
Im going to be gone before 
they even start it, so its not 
going to affect me at all. But 
what can you do about it? 
Youre in a hopeless position. I 
mean, Im not going to give 
them any money. I already 
pay them enough. Im not going 
to lose sleep about it. What can 
you do?
 Chris Shields 
Sophomore, Graphic Design
They said theyre going to 
mplement it, then they said 
heyre going to delay it. Its 
[oing to go on indefinitely. It 
loesnt give you much faith in 
he administration.
 Soo-ryun Sue 
Junior, Professional/ 
Technical Writing
I dont think its a good 
idea to have it postponed. I 
think its been postponed too 
long already. I think they 
could start building now with 
the money they have. I think 
it would be worthwhile to 
build the student center and 
postpone renovations on the 
existing buildings.
 Derek Touw 
Senior, Computer Science
I didnt think they were 
going to go through with it in 
the first place. I didnt think 
it was realistic.
 Karla Ivarson
Sophomore, H&SS
Its sad. We really need a 
new student center. But re
alitys reality if we dont 
have the funds for it, we cant 
do it. I think the University 
Center should take prece
dence.
 Devon Smullen 
Junior, Art
I dont know anything 
about it. I have no opinion.
 Heather Bauder 
Freshman, Civil 
Engineering
I expected as much. It all 
hinges on whether they actu
ally can get the money and 
are just dragging their feet, 
or whether they do have a 
problem raising it, and that I 
dont know. But I expected as 
much.

red across campus. [President 
t] plans to announce the postponet of the proposed University Center 
(least the next five years, the post
ed. Were not going to put up with 
fin promises anymore.
Friday, Cyert addressed members 
student body in the Wherrett 
f1 and discussed fundraising for the 
mt center. Reading from a prepared 
Qient, Cyert grouped the Univerenter building and the current East 
}us project as a single University 
Complex.
* anticipated investment for the 
ersity Center Complex... is approxi\? $70 million, he said. Half the 
ng ($35 million) for this complex 
een secured.... The remaining funds 
million) to complete the complex 
ntinue to be one of the focal points 
I capital campaign.
1 an interview prior to Cyerts 
jh> Vice President for Development
and University Attorney Alvin P. Brannick said that only $500,000 for the 
student center itself had been raised.
Explaining the lack of funds for the 
student center, Brannick cited the diffi
culties involved in raising funds for build
ings. If I ever had to do it again, the one 
thing Id never allow anybody to do is 
wrap either bricks and mortar around an 
academic campaign or an academic 
campaign around bricks and mortar, he 
said. People say you cant raise funds for 
bricks and mortar, and I think its be
cause of the atmosphere you set up. 
Life Trustee Robert A. Charpie, who 
has worked on capital campaigns for 
buildings at both CMU and MIT, agreed 
with Brannick. The University Center 
is just not the kind of thing that attracts 
the average donor, he told The Tartan.
But student critics say the reason the 
administration has been unable to raise 
funds for the University Center is the 
priorities it has set. I dont think theyre 
pushing the University Center as their 
number one priority for raising funds, 
Robitshek said. Theyre pushing a pack
age deal.
Both Brannick and Cyert admitted that 
the University Center does not have top 
priority. Somebody asked me which 
[project] was number one, said Bran
nick. I told him that they were all number 
one. Theyre the reason Im here.
Cyert also conceded that other projects 
rank equally in importance with the 
University Center. There isnt any top 
priority  theres a series of projects. 
Although he admitted his office had 
not given the center top priority, Bran
nick defended the amount of effort his 
group has expended on the campaign. 
Theres not a fundraiser on this project 
that hasnt worked themselves into a 
frenzy trying to pull the whole thing off, 
he said. Theres been no lack of effort. 
Most student leaders are optimistic 
about the administrations chances for 
raising funds for the University Center 
project if it is given priority. I think the 
people in the Development Office, if 
guided in the right direction, can pull 
this off, said Robitshek. Im betting 
that they could do it if they tried.

Cyerts address to the students
By SHARI MILLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Along with his statement on the Uni
versity Center situation, President 
Cyert spoke on other issues pertinent 
to the CMU community. Among these 
were his impending retirement, the 
Beaux Arts Ball, Ernest Alieva, the 
schools finances, improving the qual
ity of teaching, the housing and frater
nity situations, and CMU sports.
An estimated 200 people attended 
Cyerts address, almost three times as 
many people as attended his first 
address this fall.
Cyert reiterated his plans to retire at 
the end of the next academic year, say
ing that after 18 years, he recognized 
the need for new, vigorous leadership. 
He said that he would like to rejoin the 
faculty and teach again. He would also 
like to continue fundraising.
Because the fraternities are in need 
of structural repair and maintenance, 
Cyert stated that a housing supervisor 
will be appointed to deal with these
matters. More money will have to be 
raised, however, to meet these needs. 
He mentioned that the burden may 
fall partly upon fraternity members.
The University is trying to make it 
possible for Ernest Alieva to stay on 
and teach. Cyert maintained that the 
rumors concerning Alievas being fired 
are false, and that it is up to Alieva 
whether or not he continues to teach. 
He stated I am hopeful... that he will 
stay on and teach here.
Cyert went on to congratulate the 
swim team and the womens basket
ball team on their records.
Next, Cyert discussed of the quality 
of teaching at CMU. He talked about 
the improvement, of foreign graduate 
students English in the past few years 
through the English as a Second Lan
guage Center.
In analyzing teachers performances, 
Cyert stated his desire to look at more 
than course evaluations and research 
work. He mentioned proposals of ana
lyzing syllabi and taping classes for
Donors claim they were asked to give for Center
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Along with other projects, CMU is em
phasizing the University Center in its 
fundraising activities, according to some 
members of the Board of Trustees and 
recent donors. Others, however, feel that 
a better job could be done.
The administration contends that the 
school has been making an effort to raise 
money for the University Center but has 
had trouble convincing potential donors 
to give funds for it. Many donors, admin
istrators say, prefer to restrict their gifts 
to academic projects such as scholar
ships and named professorships.
Dr. S. J. Dudzinsky, Jr., a 1961 CIT 
alumnus, recently donated-a scholarship 
in the name of his parents. He says that 
he considered giving the money for other 
uses, including a named chair and the 
construction of the physical plant build
ing, before deciding on the scholarship.
Although the University Center was 
not among his top choices to receive his
gift, Dudzinsky says that the University 
actively pushed the campus construc
tion plan, including the University Cen
ter, when asking him for money. He does 
not think that donors in general are less 
likely to donate to the University Center 
than to other projects: I think it really 
depends on the individual.
Joseph F. Thomas, a 1938 CFA gradu
ate, gives an annual gift for an architec
ture scholarship. He began the scholar
ship at CMUs request a few years ago.
However, Thomas confirms that re
cently the University has emphasized 
the University Center. He says that he 
has been back to CMU for meetings and 
the Center has been mentioned often. I 
know that the University Center is one 
of their top projects, he states.
Another recent donor, Robert I. Broida 
(CFA, 1952), gave an unrestricted gift to 
CMU. He says that he was contacted 
personally by Cyert; he had met Cyert 
before but does not know him well.
Trustee Theodore Nierenberg is not as 
sure as others that the capital campaign
is being run with the University Center 
as a top priority. He says that he has the 
feeling that students and faculty want 
the University Center and that Cyert 
agrees. However, he says that appar
ently no money has been raised for it.
Nierenberg thinks that the key ques
tion is how to set the goal. The Board of 
Trustees, he says, feels the $200 million 
capital campaign goal is realistic, but he 
complains that nobody knew if a spe
cific portion of that budget was for the 
University Center. He also says that 
Cyert decided to carry out the East Cam
pus project first, leaving no money for 
the University Center. As the head of the 
Campus Redesign Committee, Nieren
berg put in a lot of time on the construc
tion project, including the University 
Center, and is now askinghimself Why?
Nierenberg also thinks Cyert may be 
planning to upgrade athletic facilities on 
campus and leave Skibo standing in place 
of the University Center. He comments 
that I think the whole thing, now, is a 
lost issue until we get a new president.

(i) Resolution
The Student Senate hereby 
eclares its support of the Uniersity Parking Committee Reso*tion contained in the following
ages.
[Explanation: we have been 
sked by Chuck Thorpe to aprove this committee setup.]
This resolution passed in Sen
te 3-7-89.
(ii) A special request for an 
location was given to WRCT for 
taggy scoreboard. The cost is 
315.00. This passed in Senate.
(iii) The Rules Committee in
duced four Constitutional 
^lendments which will be dis
ussed at next weeks Senate 
Meeting.
(iv) Resolution
Whereas the Student Senate is 
one of the main outlets of student 
opinion at Carnegie Mellon,
And whereas Skibo does not 
meet current students needsit 
was built in 1960 when enroll
ment was thirty percent lower 
that it is today,
And whereas the present esti
mate for the University Center 
has been put at five years or more 
from now instead of the previous 
timetable that would have started 
ground breaking within the next 
year,
And whereas the University 
Center would service many needs 
in a single structure 
These include:
 Creation of a common place 
for all students, staff, and faculty 
to meet and gather,
 Increased number of accessible 
student offices,
Increased meeting rooms,
A central building for student 
services,
And whereas a new University 
Center has been proposed for the 
students of Carnegie Mellon, 
And whereas, according to the 
Task Force Report of the Quality 
of Student Life, should commence
at the earliest possible time,
And whereas the administra
tion has made a commitment to 
improving the quality of student 
life last year by making the Uni
versity Center a top priority. By 
pushing the construction date 
back by five to six years, the 
administration is making a state
ment that the quality of student 
life is no longer a top priority,
And whereas the administra
tion has determined that a need 
existed for a new Physical Plant 
Building, money was budgeted 
and construction began immedi
ately. Rather than depend on 
donated funds, the administra
tion should deem the University 
Center a top priority and budget 
for it as such,
We the Student Senate of Car
negie Mellon, as a student voice, 
demand that the University 
Center be made the top priority of 
the University. The Cyert admini
stration should do its utmost to 
make the University Center the 
center of the current capital 
campaign. This work should then 
be continued by the next presi
dent.

HOT NEW PROGRESSIVE POP 
FROM THE NATIONS CAPITAL

---------------------------------------------------

Greek Sing rocked!
Like a student returning 
home after finals, Greek Sings 
return to the Syria Mosque was 
awkward but welcome.
Literally, the show was a suc
cess. It raised several thousand 
dollars for Multiple Sclerosis, 
and it allowed the Greek or
ganizations to show off on stage.
Hats off to all nineteen fra
ternities and sororities; we had 
as much fun watching your acts 
as you had performing them. 
All of the hard work invested 
Was evident from our seats.
The return to the Mosque al
lowed Greek Council to sell 
more tickets than at last years 
site, Carnegie Music Hall. The 
plentiful seating prevented 
Sing from being the scarce 
iicket it normally is. This year, 
people not involved in the Greek 
system had a much easier time
getting tickets for the show.
However, there were prob
lems. Seats that didnt exist 
were sold. Lighting and sound 
were, at times, rough. The hall 
was hot and stuffy. These prob
lems need to be fixed for next 
year.
Nonetheless, the problems as
sociated with the Mosque 
should not detract from the 
actual event. It was a success, 
and it was a lot of fun  for 
participants and spectators. 
Besides, both Edye Tarbox and 
Dagney Hultgreen attended.
Most of the problems were a 
result of the site change, but, 
provided they get fixed, we hope 
Sing stays at the Mosque. That 
way, everyone who wants to be 
involved, performer or specta
tor, will be able to so. Thats 
what Sing is all about.
CMUs own Great Lakes
CMU is recognized world
wide for its engineering pro
gram. Perhaps its time to util
ize these resources to provide 
sidewalks that drain properly.
Pittsburgh receives a large 
"amount of rain in the spring 
and fall (most of the time we 
are in school). This rainfall 
causes many of the sidewalks 
n campus to form small lakes.
The lake effect is particularly 
bad on the sidewalks between 
Morewood and Skibo (Lake 
Cyert) and Baker and Warner 
(Lake Feinberg), the transpor
tation arteries of the campus.
Anyone who has walked on 
these sidewalks after a rainfall 
has faced the danger of cross
ing these lakes.
Because of both Lake Cyert 
and Lake Feinberg, students 
must veer from the sidewalks 
into the grass to prevent get
ting wet feet. This creates 
muddy patches along the side
walks by the lakes, but people 
still walk in the muddy patches 
 people must prefer getting 
th bottoms of their shoes dirty 
to. wearing wet shoes all day. 
Wet feet are unhealthy, unsafe,
and uncomfortable.
The Lakes arent the only 
problem with the sidewalks. 
Last Sunday, there was a huge 
snowfall, and the sidewalks 
were covered with snow.
Clearing the sidewalks after 
a snowfall should be a top pri
ority. The clearing of the side
walk on Monday was atrocious. 
Many sidewalks on campus 
were not even plowed; rather 
they were simply salted, and 
many steps were not cleared of 
snow or ice.
By not clearing the sidewalks 
and steps, a hazardous situ
ation was created for Carnegie 
Mellon students.
It is vital on a college campus 
that the sidewalks be safe to 
travel. Most students have to 
walk, and as a result must 
travel along the sidewalks 
regardless of the conditions 
they are in.
It is necessary for students to 
go to class, go to the library, 
and go to the dinning facilities.
So lets provide students with 
safe walkways around campus. 
It isnt too much to ask for safe, 
dry sidewalks.

Dean and associate react to the student press
Editor;
We write in response to the flurry of 
articles and editorials that have appeared 
in the student press over the past week, 
about the last H&SS College Council 
meeting, and, specifically, the status and 
future of the Bachelor of Arts (BA) de
gree in H&SS. The way that issues and 
policies have been defined in the press, 
and statements and positions attributed 
to various individuals, have reached so 
distressing a degree of distortion and 
misrepresentation that we must, we feel, 
set the record straight and assure H&SS 
BA students that their degrees future 
are secure, and never were otherwise.
First, and most importantly, we ad
dress our BA students, present and fu
ture, and assure you that you and your 
degrees future are secure in H&SS. At 
the February 20 Council meeting, there 
was no discussion of the future of the BA 
in H&SS (contrary to the impression 
conveyed by the headline in The Tartan) 
and, had there been one, we are sure that 
it would have been positive and suppor
tive. For example, for the past few years 
the Deans Office has continually con
ferred with the Admissions Office about 
strategies for increasing the number of 
humanities .applicants to H&SS. In 
addition, H&SS has expanded offerings 
in the humanities by the creation of 
double major options of BA students with 
the Mellon College of Science, and minor 
programs in Film Studies, Social and 
Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, and 
(now under discussion) Minority/Ethnic 
Studies. The Tartan states that BA
~lmmlu3 me myl Osameu
majors are on the decline in H&SS, cit
ing a one-year shift that actually amounts 
to nothing more than rather normal fluc
tuation. But double majors in the hu
manities (which puts overall interest in 
BA areas in fuller context) have main
tained very healthy levels over the last 
several years, with the same type of fluc
tuation but, over the one-year period 
cited by The Tartan, showing a fifteen 
percent increase. Our general message 
to BA students is this: you and the range 
of area studies that your interests repre
sent are highly valued parts of the col
leges research and teaching enterprise, 
and there is nothing whatsoever uncer
tain about your future here. We are 
delighted that you are here, and look 
forward to enrolling many more like you.
Second, we address the issue of how 
our College Council organizes, conducts, 
and reports its proceedings. It is indeed 
true (by virtue of consistent practice for 
at least the last decade) that H&SS 
College Council meetings are closed, 
by which we mean that attendance and 
participation is limited to members and 
invited guests. This, it seems to us, should 
be obvious to all Council members sim
ply by the manner in which Council 
membership is determined, its meetings 
organized and conducted, and accounts 
of its proceedings certified by subsequent 
Council vote on the minutes of what 
transpired. As a corollary, it has also
been long-standing practice that in th 
reporting of Council proceedings, thi 
details of debate (i.e., who said what) ai 
privileged and confidential. A reading 
any set of Council minutes reveals thi 
quite clearly. This, we feel, is an impoi 
tant courtesy to all Council members, 
that to do otherwise could hamper th 
free expression of controversial position 
within Council sessions, or the discus 
sion of issues that are quite clearly cod 
fidential. We grant that perhaps thes 
practices need more explicit clarificatio 
to Council, and we shall certainly do this 
However, we still take issue with th 
February 22 Student Union article ths 
had the clear appearance of an author 
tative report of what transpired at thi 
Council meeting. Mind you, some of whs 
it reported was correct. As a wholi 
however, it was incomplete and in sora 
instances (along with other facts ii 
ferred in the accompanying editoria 
^correct, and authored by one who m 
absent for half of the meeting. It was 
best, therefore, a largely second-ham 
unofficial, and, in many respects, ina 
rate account. These are the main issue 
and objections raised in correspondent 
with the Student Union.
In discussions of this issue, the st 
dent press has further confused mattei 
by using the terms secret and closa 
interchangeably to describe what hi 
allegedly been said about the conduct 
College Council sessions. Council mee 
ings are most decidedly not secret, and 
was never said that they were. (Indee

Department Head Glymour supports Fienberg
Editor:
The Tartan does the University a serv
ice by providing a public forum for issues 
of educational policy at Carnegie Mellon. 
It does something less when it publishes 
what purports to be a news article con
taining repeated allegations about the 
intentions of the dean of H&SS while 
failing to present the surrounding is
sues. The allegations of intent are 
founded on ignorance, and they are 
malicious.
I no more than others can peer into the 
deans soul, but I have worked with (and 
sometimes against) him for five years, 
before and after he became dean. I have 
never seen an administrator more intel
ligently devoted to undergraduate edu
cation. He gives his time to it; he puts 
what optional funds he has to it; he 
thinks about it; and he puts every moral 
pressure he can upon the faculty to do 
the same. Contrary to the allegations 
you repeat, since he has been dean of the 
college I have not once seen him give 
what I thought to be unjust preference to
the Statistics Department, and as a 
department Head competing for the col
leges resources I am ever on the lookout 
for just such inequities.
Part of the deans job is to try to assure 
quality of education when individual 
departments would reduce it for the sake 
of increased enrollments, or to appease 
unhappy faculty, or for some other rea
son, however innocent or well-inten
tioned. That is also part of the duty of 
members of the College Council. Any fair 
or serious discussion of the College 
Councils recent deliberations on the 
History Departments initiative should 
recognize that issue. Your reporter 
thought it not worthy of mention. The 
accompanying article on the new major 
contains one sentence, attributed to 
Professor Stearns, that states the con
cern of some members of the Council and 
indicates the context of the meeting.
Some members of the Council, myself 
included, had misgivings about the His
tory Departments proposals. Those mis
givings had to do with the adequacy of a
social science curriculum founded 
writings in economics, sociology, an 
linguistics that does little to introducei 
give students the mathematical prep! 
ration even to read mainstream work 
contemporary quantitative economic 
social science methodology, or lingui 
tics. The dean proposed a compromii 
which allows a Bachelor of Science 
gree to be instituted that would insa: 
Social Science History majors kno 
enough statistics and calculus to 
to read modern quantitative social st 
ence should they choose. The compfl 
mise carried. Whether it ought to ha' 
carried, whether the concerns of son 
members of the Council were misplace* 
whether even a BS major of this kind 
appropriate, are legitimate issues whi 
the members discussed courteously a1 
rationally. It is such issues, and n 
rumors of intent, that deserve attentif 
in your pages.

versity holidays. Perhaps Mr. Drout 
needs to check the University calendar 
and get his facts straight concerning 
these official holidays.
The days before and after Carnival are 
not holidays. Likewise, the weekend 
preceding midsemester break is not an 
official University holiday, nor are the 
weekends preceding and following the 
five days of spring break. Instructors are
totally within their rights to assign work 
which can be completed during these 
times. Expecting students to use these 
non-holidays as they would any other  
for doing homework as well as relaxing
 is not unreasonable.
If an instructor assigns an excessive 
amount of work to students  work 
which can only be completed by dipping 
into the official holidays  then such a 
situation is unfair.
Mr. Drout, however, implies that as
signing any work at all during the days 
preceding and/or following a holiday is 
unfair: (to quote Mr. Drout) All depart
ments assign tests, problem sets, papers
and quizzes immediately before and 
ter Carnival as well as over midsemest1 
and spring break.
Maybe Mr. Drout, not the faculty, ne# 
a reminder of what a holiday is. Her 
is: Dear Mr. Drout, just to remind yoa 
one-day holiday is just that  one ds 
not three or four; a five-day holiday 
just that  five days, not nine or tenyou would like this situation to chafl: 
direct your comments to those pe[ 
responsible for designating Univera 
holidays, not to the instructors.

John Tower is the man to lead 
CMU into the 21st century
has a strong (although com
pletely inexplicable) appeal to 
women. With him as president, 
CMUs infamous 47:1 malefemale ratio would be a thing of 
the past.
Reason #3  Fundraising: If 
Tower could achieve the organ
izational equivalent of the 
$750,000 he managed to get out 
of defense contractors for him
self, we could have the Univer
sity Center in a week. Of course, 
we might have to put up with 
the Lockheed Room and Gen
eral Dynamics Cafeteria, but I 
can live with that. At least Ill 
be able to remember how many 
Rs and Ts there are in Lock
heed.
Reason #4No more trouble 
from the LCB: The LCB can 
only afford to have a certain 
number of people watching 
CMU. If all of their agents are 
staking out the sixth floor of 
Warner Hall, they will have to 
leave students alone.
I have contacted Tower and 
tentatively offered him the job. 
He said that he might be inter
ested but that Carnegie Mellon 
had better make a firm offer 
soon because he is considering 
accepting another tempting 
career opportunity  sitting in 
a Texas bar gulping whiskey 
and hitting on women for a liv
ing.
Isnt life great? Just as Car
negie Mellon begins to search 
for a person to replace Presi
dent Cyert, the United States 
Senate gives us the perfect 
candidate, a man uniquely 
qualified to nurture the next 
generation of American lead
ers. I am speaking, of course, of 
failed Secretary of Defense 
Nominee John Tower.
Now, I know what youre all 
thinking: Why would we possi
bly want a guy that doesnt even 
meet the Pentagons moral stan
dards? I mean they are full of 
people even the mafia wouldnt 
touch. That is true. However, I 
think that once you see my rea
sons for suggesting Tower, you 
will agree that he is just the 
person we need at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Reason #1  Identification: 
Students, especially seniors, 
will identify with Tower. He 
has spent too many years drink
ing and trying to pick up women, 
and now he is having a hard 
time finding a job. Also, as a 
former senator he understands 
the concept of sitting on the 
fence. Short of promising to 
tear down Hamerschlag House, 
what more could he do to ap
peal to students at Carnegie 
Mellon?
Reason #2  Recruitment: 
Despite improvements in recent 
years, Carnegie Mellon still 
needs to attract more female 
students. As we all know, Tower

ology major and a Tartan con

Pioneers protest denial of special interest housing
Snow and ice should not be 
ignored by Physical Plant
Editor:
On Wednesday night, March 8, 
at approximately 11:15 pm, I came 
very close to being seriously in
jured due to the negligence of 
CMU. I was walking down the 
steps that lead to the CFA base
ment from the Studio Theatre and 
GSIA, when I slipped and fell. 
The steps were very icy as no one 
had even attempted to clear them.
Do they think that no one uses 
that entrance? If that is the case, 
then they are grossly mistaken. It 
is the shortest route from CFA to 
the Studio Theatre and quite of
ten the people using it are carry
ing heavy objects (platforms, scen
ery, furniture, etc.) between the 
Studio and CFA. Leaving them 
uncleared of snow and ice is a 
serious hazard.
I had been between the two 
buildings several times during the 
night and had noticed that it was
slippery and someone was likely 
to get hurt. It wasnt until I was 
leaving for the night that I slipped 
and fell flat on my back. I was 
lucky, I was wearing my back
pack at the time and it cushioned 
the fall, so all I got was a few 
bruises and a sore back. If it hadnt 
been for my backpack, I might 
possibly have had serious back 
injury, spinal injury, or a concus
sion. I was also lucky in that I was 
not alone at the time. If the worst 
had happened and no one was 
there to help, it is quite possible 
that I would have been there all 
night.
This negligence has got to stop. 
This is just one example of poor or 
incomplete snow removal on 
campus, and by no means the 
only one.

We are shocked and disap
pointed by Housings decision to 
remove Pioneers from their spe
cial interest house. Pioneers has 
existed in a special interest house 
for the past two years. During 
that time, the organization most 
certainly lived up to Housings 
standards for what a special in
terest house should provide to the 
campus community. However, on 
March 3, Housing decided that 
Pioneers was unfit to remain in a 
special interest house. This 
stripped Pio
neers of one of its 
most crucial 
foundations  a 
central meeting 
place.
When Pio
neers started out 
in the spring of 
1987, it was pri
marily a buggy 
and booth organization. After 
Carnival, Pioneers decided to be 
more than just another Spring 
Carnival competitor and from that 
point on, we decided to be a co-ed 
social organization. The idea is to 
provide an alternative on this 
campus for students who wish to 
be involved socially with a group. 
Our selling points are our open 
door policy (anyone can join) and 
our policy of no commitment 
(attend whatever you want, when
ever you want). We may have 
been able to co-ordinate our Car
nival program without a house, 
but co-ordinating our social pro
gram without a house would not 
have been as easy. This is from
~lmmlu3 me myl Osameu
where our needfor a special inter
est house stems.
The idea behind the special 
interest house is to allow groups 
of individuals to live together so 
that they can benefit the campus 
community. It is bewildering to 
us that Housing has decided that 
Pioneers does not fit this descrip
tion.
For the past two years, PioFor the past two year, Pioneers has 
been one of the few organizations 
existing in the special interest 
houses which caters to the entire 
student population.
neers has been one of the few 
organizations existing in the 
special interest houses which 
caters to the entire student popu
lation. The Pioneers membership 
consists of various ethnic groups, 
all five colleges, and athletes as 
well as non-athletes, where many 
of the other special interest houses 
offer activities to a very small 
fraction of the campus popula
tion. In addition, Pioneers has by 
far offered more activities to the 
campus community than any 
other organization residing in the 
special interest houses during the 
past two years. Besides buggy, 
booth, IM sports, and planned so
cial events, the Pioneers house
provides social life for a large 
number of people on a daily basis. 
On a campus which is often de
scribed as socially lacking, an 
alternative such as this should 
not be eliminated.
In the past year, Pioneers has 
bent over backwards to keep 
Housing pleased. Last semester, 
at the request of Housing, Pio
neers opened up two of the or
ganizations social events to the 
Hill dorms: a zoo trip and a Satur
day afternoon barbecue in the 
Margaret Morrison courtyard. As 
requested by 
Housing, Pio
neers made and 
distributed post
ers advertising 
both events. At 
the barbecue, 
Pioneers col
lected money to 
w cover Housing
Office expenses, 
once again, as per the request of 
Housing. In reference to social 
events that were not held in con
junction with the Housing Office, 
Pioneers made a big effort to stay 
within Housings rules and regu
lations for campus dormitories. 
At the end of the fall 88 semester, 
Cindy Sammons sent Pioneers a 
Christmas card on behalf of the 
Housing Office stating that Hous
ing was very pleased with our 
performance to date. Yet, come 
March, the decision was made to 
remove Pioneers from the special 
interest houses.
After the decision was made, 
representatives from our organi
zation met with Housing to in
quire as to why Pioneers is being 
removed from the speciaUnterest 
houses. Housing stated tlaat the 
removal was not related-in any 
way to our past record. However, 
they are implementing a new 
policy for the special interest 
houses and regardless of how good 
our past record may have been, 
we do not fit the bill. This coming 
year, Housing is trying to fill the 
four special interest houses with 
groups that will complement each 
other: an athletic house^ an aca
demic house, an ethnic house, and 
a house which has globaWnterests. These four entities combined 
will create the diversity that 
Housing is looking for in the spe
cial interest houses. Unfortu
nately for Pioneers, we-^already 
have this diversity in one organi
zation and, as a result of this, we 
are out on the street.
Pioneers has been struggling 
very hard to be more than just a 
Carnival organization. Tfie house 
was a great asset in winning this 
struggle and its loss is-a great 
blow to our organization._As a 
founding member of the organi
zation, I have seen the Pioneers 
grow from a small but del^f joined 
group into a thriving social or
ganization. This growth took"'place 
as a result of the hard work, and 
determination of a number of 
individuals. After all that work, it 
is very painful for these individu
als and myself to watch Pioneers 
get driven out of the house.

Student questions Dean Feinbergs intentions
Ed. note - The following is an 
open letter to Dean Fienberg.
Dear Dean Fienberg:
My name is Seth Kaufman. I 
am a sophomore Biology major. I 
am on Student Senate, and Politi
cal Speakers Form Board, as well 
as being involved with several 
other campus organizations. I 
have been reading the articles in 
the papers recently about the BA 
and BS degrees in H&SS [H&SS 
College Council Makes Major, 
Cultural Genocide, and Devine 
Speaks for College Council in 
the Student Union; BA future 
uncertain after H&SS Council 
and H&SS should keep BA de
gree, in The Tartan (March 7 
issue)]. After reading these ar
ticles and editorials, a few ques
tions remain in my mind, and in 
the minds of everyone I have 
talked to. I hope you can answer 
these questions for me, and the 
campus in general.
In The Tartan, you say you are
trying to offer H&SS students a 
better perspective. It seems that 
by not giving students the option 
to choose between a BA and a BS, 
you are not offering students 
anything, but forcing them into 
what some see as a better per
spective. How does a second 
semester of statistics and a se
mester of 
calculus 
give a stu
dent a better 
perspective?
I have not 
used calcu
lus in any of 
my H&SS 
classes (I am 
taking three 
history 
classes this 
semester,
and have taken three other H&SS 
courses). As a matter of fact, I 
have not used calculus outside of 
my freshman year MCS Core 
courses. How do these extra
classes give a better perspective? 
Accordingto theStudent Union 
editorial, the Tartan article, and 
at least two people at the Council 
meeting, you said you thought 
that it was clear that BA pro
grams were to be phased out. 
Why, in a college of Humanities 
and Social Science  what I
The important issue here is not 
whether the proceedings^-of this

reported. The issue is, sh^d the

The minutes of the meetings are 
approved by the Council, and sent 
to all the members of the Council. 
Are these minutes a matter of 
public record?

win the election in 1984. For at 
least five years, the head of the 
.Treasury Police, the agency re
sponsible for most of the humanrights abuses, was on the CIA 
payroll. And the CIA trained the 
death squads in the techniques of 
torture. John Stock well, a former 
CIA employee, described it: They 
developed a wire that was strong 
enough to carry the current and 
fine enough to fit between the 
teeth, so you could put one wire 
between the teeth and the other 
one in or around the genitals and 
you could crank and submit the 
individual to the greatest amount 
of pain, supposedly, that the 
human body can register.
Our government claims that it 
is appalled by the death-squad 
activity and that it is run by some 
renegade people independent of 
the government. However, the 
trainers of the death squads have 
direct links to the U.S. govern
ment. DAubuissons death squads

of responsibility for what they

accountable, they tend to act more 
irresponsibly. It seems that when

the chance to expand the Univer
sity to prevent the addition of 
new BA degrees? Are you not going

degree?
You claim that BS degrees are

the job market? Are BS gradu

Concerning the College Coun

someone on College Council and 
ask them to explain why they said

The present system equals the 
U.S. Congress, where all sessions

Jim Sire returns to defend Christianity
5l88 Hnumue
He looks like Surgeon General 
C. Everett Koop, but his special
ity is not medicine. He is more 
interested in what people believe 
than in how they feel. He is Dr. 
James A. Sire  lecturer, author, 
and senior editor of InterVarsity 
Press (IVP).
His concern is not only what 
people believe but why they be
lieve. Why believe anything at 
all? asks Sire. According to him, 
there is only one correct answer: 
because what you believe is true. 
Sire lectures to make students 
think about the validity of their 
beliefs.
Religious controversy is Sires 
specialty, for he has done consid
erable research in the this area. 
In his book The Universe Next 
Door, Sire explains Christian 
Theism, Deism, Naturalism, 
Nihilism, Existentialism, Eastern 
Pantheistic Monism, and the New 
Age Movement. In the books 
conclusion, he suggests criteria 
for choosing a world view.
In his presentation, Sire ex
plores the reasons for accepting a 
world view or anything else. He 
asks the audience for common 
rationale for believing. Then he 
analyzes these reasons and re
futes most of them, which usually 
leads to a lively discussion.
Sire concludes by stating that 
Christianity is worth believing. If 
anybody wants to discuss the 
claims of Christianity in more 
detail, Sire will talk for hours
with them after his lecture.
Sire uses intellectual backing 
to defend the Christian faith. He 
gives six reasons for believing it.
The character of Jesus Christ 
as presented in the Gospels. Jesus 
is different from all religious 
founders because he claimed to 
be God incarnate. The Bible gives 
an account of Christs sin-free life, 
authority to forgive sins, compas
sion, miracles, resurrection, and 
inevitable second coming.
The internal consistency and 
coherence of the Christian world 
view. The Bible provides an ex
planation of human perception, 
the origins and wonders of the 
cosmos, the greatness and wretch
edness of humankind, the perva
sive quality of love, the notion of 
good and evil, and the possibility 
of knowledge.
The reliability of the Bible as a 
historical document. Not only is 
the Bible historically correct, it 
correctly predicted much of his
tory. Every prophesy that the 
Bible made concerning cities and 
nations within a thousand miles 
of Israel was correctly fulfilled in 
minute detail.
The attractiveness of Christi
anity in comparison to other world 
religions. Christianity is the only 
religion that teaches substitu
tional atonement. That is, Jesus 
paid the price for everybodys sal
vation when he died on the cross 
(atonement). Therefore, people 
are saved by faith  trusting 
Christs work instead of their 
works (substitution). All other 
religions teach that salvation is 
gained by some form of works.
The testimonies of its adher
ents. Many atheists have become 
Christians, but few (none that I 
know) genuine Christians have 
become atheists. For example, 
C.S. Lewis, late professor of 
Medieval and Renaissance litera
ture at Cambridge, was an athe
ist. After becoming a Christian, 
he wrote extensively about his 
faith in the books Surprised by 
Joy and Mere Christianity.
The witness of the church 
through the ages. The Christian 
church has existed for almost 2000 
years, and it has fostered great 
developments in society. One need 
look no farther than the Ameri
can university system for an 
example. Every university that 
started in the United States be
fore 1861 was established by 
Christians. Harvard, for instance, 
was the first U.S. university; it 
was founded in 1638 by the Puri
tans. One of its central Rules 
and Precepts read, Every one 
shall consider the main end of his 
life and studies to know God and 
Jesus Christ.
In an academic spirit, Sire pro
vides an extensive reading list for 
those who want to further exam
ine the above categories. If some
one wants to consider an intellec
tual basis for Christianity, they 
will find his unique hour-and-ahalf presentation is well worth 
the time.
Jeff Fartro is a junior Tchnical 
Writing major.
Dr. Jim Sire will lecture Thurs
day in Donner Lounge. The free 
lecture will run from 7:00 to 8:30.
Deans criticize irresponsible journalism
continued from page 10
in one telephone interview last 
weekend, in discussion of this 
issue, one of us said quite ex
plicitly that, yes, Council meet
ings were traditionally closed 
[in the sense articulated above], 
but not secret. Some how, this 
clarification was reported in ex
actly th opposite fashion. ) Then 
there is the statement alleg
edly made by one of us that 
communication of College Coun
cil proceedings is never al
lowed. This too is untrue, and 
was never said. Council min
utes, it was said, are available 
for review and discussion, but 
the details of debate remain 
confidential for the reasons cited 
above.
Finally, we return to the is
sue of factual accuracy in the 
stories and editorials about the 
BA in H&SS. Here again, we 
note that Council proceedings 
were reported and editorialized 
by someone who was absent for 
half of the meeting and rele
vant discussions, and that the
factual accuracy of statements 
made and quotes attributed to 
attendees was never checked. This 
is unfortunate, in that many of 
the statements allegedly made 
were not made, or even implied. 
Most notably, for example, state
ments allegedly made that the 
BA degree are being phased out, 
and that no new BA degrees are 
being allowed are untrue, and 
were never made by anyone pres
ent. This is then compounded by a 
quote from an anonymous faculty 
member who was allegedly pres
ent during the meeting and who 
claimed that thats what [the 
Dean] said, but the transcript 
demonstrates that the Dean said 
nothing of the sort. Yet this is how 
the student press has defined the 
issues and discussions. BA ma
jors are being interviewed and 
responding that it would be a 
shame if BAs were eliminated. 
The Tartan carries a front page 
story headlined BA Future Un
certain... [March 7] An editorial 
appears in the same issue with 
the headline H&SS Should Keep
the BA Degree. This, we sub
mit, is not a shining example of 
responsible journalism.
We hope that this letter clears 
the air and clarifies the issues, 
policies, and College priorities 
raised here. We invite The Tar
tan and Student Union to re
view with us the Council min
utes and relevant excerpts of 
the tape from which the min
utes are derived, compare them 
with summaries presented in 
the press, and see if we can 
agree on the facts in this 
matter. Finally, we urge repre
sentatives of the student press 
to more carefully check their 
facts, and quotations they are 
prepared to attribute to various 
individuals, before executing 
the important responsibility of 
reporting to the campus.

How is a BS better than a BA?
Human rights violations are rampant in El Salvador

gural ball and received U.S. funding:for his Guatemalan military 
operations. Also invited to Rea
gan's ball was Licio Gelli, head of 
theP-2right-wing terrorist group 
from It-aly. This group advised 
and sent arms to DAubuisson 
and shared intelligence infor
mation with the Reagan Admini
stration.
The Salvadoran people have 
tried to stem these abuses by the 
oligarchy-backed death squads. 
However, when even humanrights monitors, religious figures, 
and educators are murdered for 
speaking out against their condi
tions, some people decide that 
their only recourse is to fight. 
Consequently, the armed rebel 
movement has gained strength in 
the last few years. They move 
freely in almost a third of the 
country. Their offer to participate 
in the upcoming March 19 elec
tions, provided that they are de
layed -6- months, indicates that 
thevare politically strong enough 
to risk acceptance of their pro
posal. The fact that the Arena 
party and the army flatly rejected 
any such proposal shows that they 
recognize this strength.
The Salvadoran government 
justifies its repression by saying 
that it must defend El Salvador 
from the Marxist-leaning rebels, 
claiming that the rebel group 
F.M.L.N. would take peoples 
freedoms away. But the people of 
El Salvador have nothing left to 
lose. While the rebels have also 
committed some human rights 
abuses in the war, they are gener
ally a much more civilized group. 
The real reason for the brutality 
is that the oligarchy will stop at 
almost nothing to maintain its 
privileged position.
Each time a human-rights vio
lation occurs in El Salvador, the 
U.S. Ambassador complains and 
demands an investigation. But 
not a single Salvadoran officer 
has been prosecuted for any 
crimes. The U.S. Congress de
mands that our President docu
ment that progress is made on 
investigating the human-rights
abuses before they will allocate 
more money for El Salvador. So 
the President claims that prog
ress is being made. The funding 
continues, but the abuses do, too. 
If our government stopped giving 
aid to the Salvadoran military, it 
is likely that the government 
would fall to the rebels in a mat
ter of weeks or months. But the 
same anti-communist paranoia 
that led us into Vietnam compels 
us to prolong the institutional
ized violence in El Salvador. How 
much longer will it take before we 
learn that the support of terror 
and torture are not the way to 
bring about democracy?

lieve History and English are the 
two biggest departments in the 
college, followed by Psychology 
and Social and Decision Sciences. 
That would make Statistics the 
fifth biggest department in the 
college.
You also say:
We are purposely encouraging 
students to take BSs in depart
ments where we think that op
tion is in the students best inter
ests and where it strengthens 
departments teaching programs.
When is a BS in students best 
interests? I am not sure why a BS 
in History is better than a BA. 
Again, on what criteria are you 
basingyour qualitative judgment? 
If students are just going to get 
jobs when they graduate, and not 
necessarily in their major, I can 
see that it might be better to have 
a BS. But, if students are going on 
to grad school, or are going to be 
working in their majors, where 
does it become advantageous for 
a student to have a BS as opposed 
to a BA? I also do not see where 
taking a BS will strengthen 
departmentsteaching programs, 
with the possible exception of the
Statistics Department. Why
would it help the History or Phi
losophy or English teaching pro
grams if students were taking a 
BS option? If the additional Sta
tistics and Calculus courses do 
strengthen other departments, 
how do they do this? How do these 
BS students who have taken these 
courses enrich the other depart
ments they are in?
You also state, Dean Fienberg, 
that part of the objective is to 
make students ask questions 
about the strengths and weak
nesses of different approaches to 
a subject. The implication here 
seems to be that the additional 
courses that a BS requires help 
you or force you to ask these 
questions. You say this question
ing is true in the sciences and it 
should be true in the humani
ties.! would ask that you explain 
what you mean by this. How do 
you justify these statements, and 
from what examples do you have 
that you draw these conclusions?
In my own experience, through
out high school and college, I have 
seen nothing to support your 
implication that the natural and/ 
or pure sciences ask you to ques
tion approaches, and the liberal 
arts do not. Quite the opposite. 
The sciences give you the infor
mation and say, Learn it. Ap
proaches are seldom discussed. 
In history courses, you are con
stantly reading information on 
events from different, and almost 
always conflicting, points of view. 
In a philosophy class, the ap
proaches are as many and varied 
as the people in the class. Every
one has their own view. These 
types of classes, it seems to me, 
ask you to question approaches 
much more than science classes.
As I said, what I have read in 
the papers lately leaves me un
clear on several topics. What is 
wrong with a BA degree? Why are 
people so adamant about the BS 
degree? And, perhaps most im
portantly, why are College Coun
cil meeting closed? And will they 
be open, at least in the papers?
I appreciate you taking the time 
to read this letter. I would like to 
thank you in advance for your 
response.
Sincerely,
Seth Kaufman

T
imes have changed since the 
seven people pictured on this 
page came to Carnegie Mellon.
Basketball was an athletic 
backwater, coming a distant third 
behind football and cross-country/ 
track. The men only had one Presi
dents Athletic Conference title, the 
women had just joined the PAC from 
the Pennwood West Conference. The 
University Athletic Association was 
but a gleam in a few peoples eyes.
We live in a different world now. 
Both basketball teams are competi
tive, on the court and on campus.
The men have stayed around the 
.500 level, rising to the occasion at 
home, but faltering away from CMU.
The women have blossomed from a 
sideline program to an NCAA-tournament caliber team.
All seven: Lightner, Long, Moffatt, 
Neupauer, Reber, Sikora, and Virgin 
have played their roles. They have all 
been starters; they have all been role 
players; they have all been there in 
the clutch situations.
Roseanna Neupauer stepped into 
the womans program in the 1985-86 
season as the sixth-person. The fol
lowing season she became a starter 
and playmaker. Off the court, her 
work was just as impressive, being 
named an Academic All-American her 
sophomore year.
David Sikora always surprised his 
opponents. Hes listed in the program 
at 63, but as the best jumper on the 
team, he played like players several 
inches taller than he. Sikora moved 
into and out of the starting lineup as 
the teams personnel varied.
Beth Virgin started from day one. A 
fixture at power forward, she could be 
counted on for eight to ten points, five 
or six rebounds, and a few steals. A 
stress fracture slowed Virgin down in 
her junior year, but she came back 
strong in her final season on the Lady 
Tartans NCAA drive.
Daren Moffatt grew into his roles, 
first at forward, and later at center. 
His first year was spent backing up 
Richard Neff and Pete Cwalina. As 
the upperclassmen moved on, Mof
fatt shared the limelight under the 
basket with Hart Coleman.
Always among the teams leaders 
in scoring and rebounding, Moffatt fi
nally took center stage his senior year, 
anchoring the front line with Long 
and junior Charles Luckett. Moffatts 
finest moment came last season 
against Bethany College. Coleman 
was knocked out of the game after 
only a minute and a half with three 
quick fouls. Moffatt took control, scor
ing 35 points, a career high. A three 
time Academic All-American, Moffatt 
has been on the All-PAC teams his 
last two seasons.
Aimee Reber started at Carnegie 
Mellon as the teams center. The addi
tion of Tricia Chorgo in her sophomore 
year allowed her to move down to her 
natural forward position. Reber was 
the teams second-leading scorer and 
rebounder during her four years.
Another of CMUs scholar-athletes, 
Reber was named an Academic AllAmerican twice in her career. Always 
a team leader, she carried the team 
through some trying times, leading 
the Lady Tartans in scoring in five out 
of six consecutive games. An ankle 
injury last season took her out of the 
starting lineup for the first time in her 
career, turning Reber into a strong 
sixth-person to come in for the team.
Darryl Long showed how a player 
can progress in four years. At last 
years PAC basketball luncheon, mens 
coach Larry Anderson called him 
maybe our best athlete. He started 
out in the dog house, but as he worked 
his way into the lineup, the tirades 
lessened and the praise began to flow.
Long took off at the beginning of his 
junior year. He opened the season by 
leading the Tartans in scoring for their 
first four games, being named Most 
Valuable Player at the seasons open
ing tournament. He ended up making 
All-PAC and All-UAA honors in his 
final two seasons, being second in team 
scoring last year, and leading the team 
this season. A complete player, he 
even hit his first three-pointer in the 
closing seconds of this years victory 
against Hiram.
Lisa Lightner was the Lady Tar
tans Reggie Jacksonthe straw that 
stirred the drink. She came from a 
state championship high school team 
in Altoona and worked to achieve the 
same results at Carnegie Mellon. The 
Lady Tartans were her team from the 
moment she came to Skibo Gymna
sium in 1985 to the final victory in 
Elizabethtown two weekends ago.
Lightner won numerous awards 
during her tenure here. She was firstteam All-PAC three times, a team 
leader in scoring, assists, and steals. 
When the womens game added the 
three-point shot to the game, Lightner 
added it to hers. The call often went 
out on WRCT, Lightner from 
three.. .Good! Her best moment came 
this season, scoring 34 points against 
arch-rival John Carroll College. She 
leaves CMU, second on the all-timing 
scoring listbehind Kathleen Segmiller.
Times have changed, and next year 
a new group of seniors will lead the 
two teams in Carnegie Mellons final 
season in the Presidents Athletic Con
ference, and its first full season in the 
University Athletic Association.
Theyll be filling some very big shoes.
We have more and better talent, 
and the support of the campus in rec
ognizing that there is a womens team. 
This has made our play able to come 
up to par with the rest of the league, 
said Lightner. Moving from the Presi
dents Athletic Conference to the Uni
versity Athletic Association will en
hance the program. The combination 
of athletes and administration work
ing together have started traditions 
that will continue into the future.
Despite these positive changes, the 
players still see areas that need im
provement. For the athletes, updat
ing the athletic facilities is a concern.
Other schools have incredible new 
complexes, and we have Thistle Hall, 
commented Reber.

Basketball champions 
decided at IM Night
By KEVIN BARNEY
Assistant Features Editor
Skibo Gym was the site of the 41st Annual IM Night last Thursday. 
The event included the awarding of trophies to the IM champions and 
the basketball championship games.
According to participants, people play IM sports as a good way to 
release tension, to take a break from studying, and just to have fun. 
Graduate student Eric Replogle stated that his involvement in IM 
tennis was the only thing that got him out of Mellon Institute, and 
kept him in shape. A Sudsucker gave his reason for playing as the 
only social activity we have. The Schlongs reason for playingFor 
moments like this as their teammate, Joe Helmson, raised their 
trophy in victory. An SAE brothers plays because there was pride 
involved in playing for his house. Rob Bowie plays because he likes 
sports and he didnt have time to participate in varsity sports.
, -'The first game of the night was the minor game where the fifth 
J ranked team, the Schlongs, went up against the sixth ranked team, 
I SAE-C. The night before, the Schlongs beat the first-ranked PAD in 
a game that went down to the last four seconds, and SAE-C beat the 
second-ranked CIA by three points.
The Schlongs took control of the game early on and never let up. In 
the first quarter, SAE-C was outscored 16-5, and at the end of the first 
MK the Schlongs were up by 21 points. The final score was 43-25.
* The intermediate basketball championship pitted The Squad and 
The Boys, two Spirit teams, against each other. The Squad took an
c^ffely lead, but The Boys fought back and at the end of the quarter, the
 sGore was even at 10.
i^jiSFhe second quarter started with an eight point run by The Boys. 
v.ffrKe Squad replied with seven of their own. In the final seconds of the
- 'half, Kelvin Belle, hit a three point shot for The Boys to give his team 
tf^f0ur point lead, 21-17.
The Squad held The Boys to only four points in the third quarter. 
"At-the end of the third, The Squad was ahead, 28-25. The Boys 
^regained the lead in the fourth quarter, and went on to win, 39-34.
 The high-scorers for the game were Jay Jammaster Glaspy with 13 
points for The Squad, and Tony Rankin with 15 for The Boys.
The final contest of the night was between Spirit-A and ECE. ECE 
jumped to an early 8-4 lead, but lost it on a foul shot by Spirits Jerry 
Harvey. Spirit had a three point margin at the end of the quarter.
Eight points were scored in the second quarter. ECE went on a six 
point streak to take the lead for the second time in the game. In the 
closing seconds of the period, Spirits Rob Bowie scored the teams 
only basket of the quarter. At the half, ECE was ahead, 18-17.
Spirit regained the lead in the third quarter, and went into the 
fourth quarter with a five point lead. With :34 left in regulation, Phil 
Nigh of ECE tied the game at 36, forcing the game into overtime. In 
overtime, ECE scored first, retaking the lead for the first time since 
the opening of the third period. Spirits Jerry Harvey hit two consecu
tive baskets to give the lead back to Spirit. With three seconds left, 
and Spirit up by three, ECE took a shot from midcourt that missed the 
basket by a few feet. The final score was Spirit 41, ECE 38.

Rowing Club ends indoor season
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Asst. Sports Editor
Freshman Jo Wollschlaeger 
started off the swim season hot 
and ended it on fire, finishing 
as a three time All American in 
the Womens Nationals held at 
Notre Dame last weekend. 
Wollschlaeger is the first fe
male swimmer from Carnegie 
Mellon to earn All American 
honors.
She claimed fourteenth place 
on the first day in the 200 yd 
individual medley (IM) with a 
time of 2:13.6.
On the second day, she earned 
fourth place in the 400 yd IM 
with a time of 4:63.8. Referring
to these races, Wollschlaeger com
mented that the other swimmers, 
all went out faster, but I would 
catch them in the end.
Wollschlaeger took third in the 
200 yd butterfly at a time of 2:10.2 
on the final day of competition.
Overall, Carnegie Mellon, with 
Wollschlaeger as its only team 
member, finished 26th out of the 
49 scoring teams in the the meet. 
Kenyon finished first, followed by 
the University of California at 
San Diego.
Schools from the University 
Athletic Association finished in 
the following order: Emory (2), 
Johns Hopkins (9), University of 
Rochester (20), CMU (26). The

The CMU Baseball Club turned 
n a 3-5 record last season, winng once against Steubenville 
1(1 twice against Penn State - 
ew Kensington, but club presient Perry Pierce is optimistic 
bout their chances for the upiming season. With the excepon of Duquesne, we have the 
jtential to beat any of the teams 
ere going to play. We just have 
get the people to the game. 
The problem to which Pierce 
fers is one of academics. Since 
e baseball club doesnt have 
irsity team status, student athtes put academics ahead of base[ll. While this is a good attitude 
(have, it creates problems for 
eteam. On game days, the team 
ten plays without a few position 
ayers. This forces many of the 
ayers to play several positions 
er the course of a season. 
Another problem related to club 
atus is conditioning. Since plays worry about classes first, they 
ten dont have time to keep in 
ape or make practice regularly. 
Pierce notes, Its hard to play 
>11 when you havent seen pitchgin a week.
Currently, the Tartans are holdg practice on Monday, Wednesy, and Friday in the gym, but 
ayers are encouraged to go in on 
lesday and Thursday as well,

The infield, with the exception 
shortstop Rafael Santana, 
lould put up some big numbers, 
ven third baseman MikePagliailo should have a good year.
Now that Rickey Henderson 
is decided that hes not really a 
iver hitter, he can go back to 
tting .300, striking out less, and 
aling over 80 bases.
Look for Don Mattingly and 
ve Winfield to have superstar 
?ars despite their battles with 
e Boss. Gary Ward and Ken 
helps should do a good job at the 
ignated hitter's spot, 
n my boldest prediction of the 
pr, I pick Dallas Green to hold 
e managers job for the entire 
fular season.
Milwaukee Brewers: The key 
the Brewers success is youth, 
ust a few years ago, this was the 
ini that employed Gorman 
jomas, Ben Oglivie, Charlie 
pore, Don Sutton, and several 
er fossils. Now they have Teddy 
juera and Dan Plesac, two of 
H best lefthanded pitchers in 
leball, as well as the pitching 
 with the most potential stars. 
'JSurhoff, overshadowed by 
Nokes and Benito Santiago 
us rookie season, is one of the 
tyoung catchers in the league. 
e infield is solid, and except for 
String of injuries last season, 
dd have carried the team into 
place. Look for Paul Molitor, 
Hagues best third baseman, 
nove to DH or second base at 
|st part-time to make room for 
A-star Gary Sheffield, 
be outfield, composed of Robin 
lnt, power hitter Rob Deer, 
^ Glenn Braggs is good enough 
a pennant, but Id like to 
| better hitting from Deer and 
l6gs (.252 and .261 respecclude a batting cage and pitching 
machine, which relieves pitchers 
from pitching batting practice.
The team hopes to get some 
practice outside before the season 
starts. Lack of good weather and 
a baseball field on campus make 
it difficult to practice outdoors. 
The club practices and plays their 
home games at Mellon Park in 
Shadyside.
The Tartans were hit hard by 
graduation, losing six seniors at a 
variety of positions. However, the 
freshman class has supplied six 
new members in addition to six 
last semester.
Since the practice season has 
just started, its hard to say how 
heavily the team is going to rely 
on its new members, but accord
ing to Pierce, Most of the fresh
men should be able to contribute 
to the team right away.
tively). The DH job could go to 
Molitor, or youngster Joey Meyer, 
who hit .263 in his debut season 
at the position.
Toronto Blue Jays: One of 
the keys to this team is its pitch
ing strength. Jimmy Key and 
Dave Stieb give the Jays a great 
one-two punch, and the trio of 
Tom Henke, Mark Eichhorn, and 
Duane Ward form the core of one 
of the best bullpens in the league. 
Free agent Bob Brenly should help 
the Jays catching until Pat Bor
ders and Greg Myers are ready to 
take over. The infield, with the 
exception of Tony Fernandez, is 
average, but third baseman Kelly 
Gruber may put up good numbers 
now that he has the job full-time. 
First baseman Fred McGriff could 
be a star if he showed more pa
tience at the plate (149 strikeouts 
last year).
The outfield was once seen as 
the best in baseball, but now 
George Bell is on his way to DH 
duties, Jesse Barfields homerun 
production has slipped, and Lloyd 
Moseby has trouble hitting the 
ball. If they can put one more 
good season together, the Jays 
would have a shot at the division 
title, but dont count on it.
Boston Red Sox: The Boston 
Red Sox are in trouble without 
Bruce Hurst. Roger Clemens will 
turn in a Cy Young season, but 
the rest of the staff seems to be a 
washout. The bullpen, if games 
ever stay that close, has one of 
baseballs hardest throwers in Lee 
Smith, and also has super setup 
man Rob Murphy.
Boston will still win some games 
because of the bats it has. Third 
baseman Wade Boggs is the best 
hitter in baseball, with apologies 
to Tony Gwynn and second base
man Marty Barrett. Barrett is 
one of the most underrated play
ers in baseball.
Outfielders Mike Green well and 
Ellis Burks have great ability, 
and Burks has, believe it or not, 
speed. Designated hitter Jim Rice 
and right fielder Dwight Evans 
still have at least one season left 
in their bats.
Boston is going to have to win a 
lot of 7-6 games over the course of 
the season.
Detroit Tigers: This club is 
the complete opposite of the Brew
ers, in that a lot of old guys are on 
the team. Jack Morris, Guillermo 
Hernandez, Chet Lemon, Dwayne 
Murphy, Lou Whitaker, and Fred 
Lynn are all pushing social secu
rity, and All-Star shortstop Alan 
Trammell isnt exactly young eiThe freshmen who have had 
the most immediate impact on 
the team are Mike Petrich and 
Mike Gess. Petrich plays short
stop and Gess is a second base
man. When they came in for the 
fall semester, they came ready to 
play, says Pierce.
Other players are center fielder 
Warren Flax, and Matt Pampena, 
whose return to the team give the 
Tartans four possible pitchers and 
a veteran shortstop.
The clubs season begins on 
Monday, April 3 at 1 pm with a 
home double-header against 
Duquesne. These are the tough
est games of the year; Duquesne 
plays Division I ball in the Atlan
tic 10 conference.
When asked about the games, 
Pierce replied, If we get the per
sonnel to the game and we have a 
good day, anything could happen.
ther. They still have some talent, 
so you cant rule them out. Jeff 
Robinson and Mike Henneman, 
are both great young pitchers (not 
the same Robinson as on the Pi
rates).
The most puzzling move of the 
off-season was shipping right 
handed pitcher Walt Terrell to 
San Diego for first baseman Keith 
Moreland and third baseman 
Chris (Tin Man) Brown. Terrell 
was a proven winner; Brown and 
Moreland are both gambles.
Cleveland Indians: Every 
year the Indians look like the team 
to beat. Every year they proceed 
to stink up the league. Why should 
this season be different?
The pitchers that the Tribe has 
been stockpiling in the draft fi
nally began to pay dividends with 
the emergence of Greg Swindell, 
John Farrell, and Scott Bailes, if 
Bailes ever gets his act together. 
Doug Jones was one of the best 
stoppers in the league, but hes 
going to ha.ve trouble if the middle 
relief doesnt improve.
The infield is solid on the right 
with first baseman Pete OBrien 
and second baseman Jerry 
Browne coming over from the 
Rangers in the Julio Franco trade, 
and third baseman Brook Jacoby 
could come back strong from last 
years dismal showing. However, 
rookie shortstop Jay Bell doesnt 
have the ability to make the 
majors yet, leaving a wide hole.
The outfield of Joe Carter, Cory 
Snyder, and Oddibe McDowell has 
talent, but all three swing too 
freely, as evidenced by their aver
age of 91 strikeouts last season. 
Rookies Luis Medina and Dave 
Clark look to get the call at DH.
Baltimore Orioles: These 
guys have a long way to go. Their 
starting pitching ace is Dave 
Schmidt, a former middle inning 
man. They have pitching rookies 
Bob Milacki, Pete Harnisch, and 
Greg Olsen, who have a combined 
49 innings of major league expe
rience; all three should be on the 
roster on Opening Day.
Phillies outcast Rich Schu was 
their regular third baseman last 
season. The only player the Os 
can really depend on is shortstop 
Cal Ripken, because they traded 
first baseman Eddie Murray to 
Los Angeles for Brian Holton, a 
setup pitcher.
The outfield is made up of 
fourth outfielders, except for Phil 
Bradley, acquired from the Phil
lies over the off-season. This is a 
classic example of the rebuilding 
project at work.

The University Rowing Club 
(URC) stunned their rowing ri
vals of Duquesne in a rowing com
petition at the Motor Square 
Garden last weekend.
Basically, we cleaned up, said 
the clubs coach Liz Winters.
In the mens open four, teams 
from Carnegie Mellon took first 
and second places. Thomas Hoeffer, Ted Ralphs, Don Williams, 
and Ted Lehr, coxed by Sophie 
Chiang, rowed across the finish 
line of the 2000 meter course first 
in a time of 5:24.8. They were 
followed by teammates Shawn 
Ohler, Kevin Goldsmith, Dan 
Ross, Jon Knight, and cox Rudy 
Zung, at 5:49.4. Duquesne fin
ished third, with a time of 5:49.7.
The Duquesne rowers were 
fresh, while all four of ours [in the 
first place boat] had already rowed 
successfully as individuals, said 
Winters.
Winters was referring to the 
2500 meter mens individual open
and lightweight races. Williams 
and Ralphs finished first and 
second, respectively, in the open, 
and Lehr finished the lightweight 
in 8:43.8, earning himself second 
place.
Harry Printz took third in the 
mens individual masters with a 
time of 9:38.2.
Not to be undone, the women 
also put in a fine performance. 
Cheri Soriano, Anna Loney, Liz
Gross, and Ellen Barry, coxed,by 
Knight, crossed the finish linsin 
third place in the 2000 meter 
womens open four at 6:59.2. Molly 
Johnson won the womens indi
vidual lightweight in a time ;of 
10:44.8.
We were all pleased with #Ur 
performance. This was a great 
way to end our indoor season and 
start our outdoor season, com
mented Winters.

TECHNOLOGY FOR A NEW AGE
Who Do You Call When You Want To Identify A Soccer Ball At 22,300 Miles In Space?
A company called "TRW". Here's the story.
The U.S. Air Force asked us to build a ground-based 
electro-optical deep space surveillance system that 
could identify an object the size of a soccer ball at 
22,300 miles in space. We did it, utilizing 3 telescopes 
and a large 4 computer system. Then they asked us to 
build four more system sites. Quite an achievement, 
but it's just one example of TRW's impact on the future. 
TRW offers you the freedom to move among a wide 
variety of opportunities in microelectronics, high 
energy lasers, large software systems, communica
tions, and scientific spacecraft. If you're majoring in 
engineering, computer science, math, or physics, and 
want to be with a company that's driving technology 
into the next century, it's not too soon to talk. Tomor
row is taking shape at a company called TRW.

Ted Danson is no dummy. Talking with him 
at the Hollywood office of his production 
company, one can quickly see that Sam 
Malone, the character he's played on the hit 
sitcom "Cheers" for the past 7 seasons, is only 
that  a character.
Born in Arizona, the son of an archaeologist, 
the former director of The Museum and 
Research Center of Northern Arizona, Danson 
had a pleasant childhood; often playing 
cowboys and Indians with real Indian children 
from the reservation near his parents' home.
He spent his teen years at private Kent School 
in Connecticut, an experience of which he has 
vivid memories. After Kent, he attended 
Stanford University for two years, before 
transferring to Carnegie Mellon (then Carnegie 
Tech) to train in his new found love: acting.
Danson graduated from Carnegie in 1972 
and went on to New York, where he 
understudied several roles on Broadway in 
"The Real Inspector Hound," eventually 
appearing on mainstage in a major role as well. 
From there, he went on to spend a brief time as 
a regular on the soap operas "The Doctors" 
and "Somerset," appeared in the films /AEf 
kieH and Mai 8SdAS IdiJEw then, in the early 
80s landed the role as Sam Malone on NBC's 
"Cheers," the role which has made his a 
household name.
Danson's solid educational background is 
only one way he differs from Sam Malone. 
Unlike Malone, Danson claims he never spent 
much time hanging out in bars and "couldn't 
play baseball to save my life." He's also been 
happily married for eleven years to Casey, an 
architect, with whom he is raising two 
daughters.
He's recently continued his successes in the 
movies, in 1987 starring with Tom Selleck and 
Steve Cuttenberg in the hit Manii riS eSE e

come on to somebody in the 
bar, I used to die a thousand

Jeffrey Zaslow (Humanities '80)
"I'm 28 years old, but with the wisdom of a 29-year-old," 
says Jeffrey Zaslow (HS '80), who replaced advice queen Ann 
Landers when she left the Chicago Sun-Times after 31 years 
there for the rival Chicago Tribune.
Zaslow covered the story, as a features writer for The Wall 
Street Journal's Chicago bureau, and beat out 12,000 other 
applicants.
In writing his daily "All That Zazz" column, he uses experts
* and a "Regular Joe Advisory Board," composed of 26 people all 
named Joe, Joanne, or Josephine. He also makes house calls 
every month.
Zaslow describes CMU, with its diversity, as a great "mindexpanding" environment. He was editor-in-chief of The Tartan, 
wrote articles for Pittsburgher magazine, and had internships. 
He says, "I loved my years at CMU. I really did. I learned a lot 
there. I matured there."

Greek Sing 89 carried off in 
style by 19 talented houses
photos by Thomas Nichols The Phantom of the Opera made his appearance.
By STEW LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
The audience had one ticket, but saw 
nineteen shows. Saturday night, the 
Greeks put on their annual Greek Sing 
at the Syria Mosque to benefit M S.
The music ranged from Cab Calloway 
and Fats Waller to Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
The costumes ranged from basic black to 
bright hues of orange, pink, and blue. 
And the performances featured every
thing from drill teams to chorus lines.
Not that there werent similarities 
among performances. If you missed ChiOs tap routine, you could still see Kappa, 
DG, or Theta pull out their tap shoes.
Animal acts, too, seemed popular; more 
animals danced on the Mosques stage 
than at a typical circus. Two Kappa Sigs 
dressed as a horse, K DR brought in a 
bear, and DU featured an uncountable 
number of prancing cats.
Old or new, the performances repre
sented the culmination of several months 
of hard work for every one involved. 
Each group had its own way of preparing 
for their parts.
Behind the stage, the brothers and 
pledges of ATO waited for some brothers 
to arrive in the wings. Im getting real 
tense, admitted Jason Dowdy as he 
watched Chi-0 perform.
Nervousness abounded, as did the 
feeling of relief when shows would fi
nally go on. DTDs John Bush couldnt 
wait for his groups turn. I dont want to 
hear anythingfrom Rocky Horror again, 
he said. I can do the moves in my sleep.
Others were just excited to be there. 
Thetas Marnie Leonard, dressed as 
Gypsy Rose Lee, admitted, I like this be
cause I can wear a dress like this and get 
away with it.
Technical problems held up the show 
until 7:50pm, when Channel 11 News 
heart throbs Edye Tarbox and Dagney 
Hultgreen walked onstage to a rousing, 
almost lusty cheer.
After the introductions, the stage be
longed to the Greeks, starting with ChiO. The sorority performed A Disney Re
view, starting quietly with Nikki Feigins 
solo When You Wish Upon a Star, and 
built to a crescendo with their finale 
taken from the Mickey Mouse Club.
Chi-0s act was dedicated to Hilary 
Fitch, an alumna who passed away ear
lier in the week, as announced by Chi-0 
president Lisa Murray before the start of 
the act. A sister commented that it was 
hard to go up there and be happy, but we 
had worked really hard on our show. 
From Chi-Os Review, the show took a 
ribald turn with ATOs version of Stripes, 
in which they acted out a meeting with 
President Cyert. Doug Cervenak brought 
down the house when he espoused, 
Thats the trick, Dick! to Cyerts in
quiries about ATO study habits.
Pika, determining not to be outdone, 
sang about all of the things that they like 
to do, from playing foozball to the happi
ness of pursuit.
Pikas show also had the distinction of 
being the first ever to be held up on stage 
in the history of Greek Sing. Midwa

Dastardly friend detected
If the service is adequate and
Dear Zazz,
A friend sold me $10 worth of 
charity sweepstakes tickets. I 
later learned that she had put 
her own name and phone num
ber on the entries.
Other people won the prizes 
 a car and a fur coat  but I 
know that if my tickets had won, 
my friend woul d never have told 
me. That makes me sick.
Should I confront her, give 
her up as a friend, or just let it 
pass?
Shocked
Dear Shocked,
If you can prove that your 
friend was as dastardly as you 
suspect, consider approaching 
her.
Let her know that youre dis
mayed by her behavior. And 
whether she denies it, gives you 
an excuse, or begs for forgive
ness, rethink your friendship.
Now that you know that she 
has a greedy, dishonest streak, 
steer clear of her in matters 
involving money or other temp
tations. Be wary. She will likely 
have to go a long way to regain 
your trust.
Dear Zazz,
My family and I recently ate 
at a very trendy restaurant. 
The dinner was average, the 
service was all right, and the 
final bill was $39.66.1 left a $3 
tip.
As we were leaving, the wait
ress chased after us and de
clared, You didnt leave 15 per
cent!
Feeling embarrassed and in
timidated, I gave her three more 
dollars. But later, after further 
thought, I was furious. I called 
the restaurant owner and de
manded that he give me my $6 
back. He sent a check.
Does a waitress have a right 
to demand 15 percent from a 
customer?
V.R., Oakland, California
Dear V.R.,
Your waitress was way out of 
line.
However, diners should ap
preciate the fact that waitresses 
earn most of their living from 
tips.
the server is pleasant, I believe 
a 15 percent tip is in order. Ex
ceptional service deserves 20 
percent.
I recently received a letter 
from a waitress who pointed 
out that she leaves part of her 
tips to the busboys who work 
hard and deserve every penny. 
She added, people who leave 
less than 15 percent have a 
million excuses. They say that 
owners should pay their wait
resses more, or that they cant 
afford to leave 15 percent. How 
can they affordto pay $12 for a 
meal, but not to leave the extra 
50 cents for the waitress tip? 
As a result of poor tips and low 
wage potential, good waitresses 
are leaving the restaurant busi
ness in droves.
If some waitresses flip out 
and chase diners to the front 
door, I suspect its a result of 
being stiffed a few times too 
many.
Dear Zazz,
Ive been invited to my girl
friends parents home for din
ner. Ive never met them.
They plan to serve ham, 
which I cant eat. My girlfriend 
wants to tell them this, but I 
think we ought to keep quiet. I 
dont want to be a trouble
maker before I even meet them.
No Ham
Dear No,
Sure, your girlfriend can tell 
them that you dont eat ham. 
Whether its for reasons of reli
gion, dietor taste, theyd proba
bly prefer to know about it. 
They can always alter their 
menu.
If you insist that your girl
friend keep quiet, youll end up 
at her parents house with a 
plate of ham in front of you. 
What then? Well, unless youre 
good at spreading food north 
and south  and hiding meat 
under potatoes  in the end 
youll have no choice but to be 
honest.
When you let them know that 
you dont eat ham, just add: I 
know Ill find enough to eat, so 
please dont prepare anything 
special for me. Im just very 
pleased to finally meet the both 
of you.
They may be so impressed by 
your good manners that theyll 
head for the kitchen to whip up 
something youll actually be 
able to eat.

through their performance, the 
brothers were terrorized by a guntoting thug; then rescued by Bat
man and Robin, who captured 
the villain after a lengthy chase.
The last in the trio of not-soserious performers was Beta. 
After senior Gregg Brandts solo 
on Rai se Your Hands To Heaven 
the brothers broke into a rousing 
version of Wild Thing.
Next up was the first perform
ance from a Broadway show, done 
by AEPi. Jay Kirschenbaum was 
convinced that after their rendi
tion of 1776, Signing the Decla
ration of Independence will never 
be the same. Most of their show 
featured the fights between 
Samuel Adams and Thomas Jef
ferson ... Adams won.
Kappa followed with their se
lections from Sugar Babies. In 
costumes of bright pink, blue, and 
orange, the chorus line of sugar 
babies showed lots of leg and 
proved that they could tap dance 
with the best of them as they 
covered the stage doing the Sugar 
Baby Bounce.
Kappa Sig came next, and re
ceived a bit of help from Saturday 
Night Lives Hans and Franz. The 
duo were pumped up to the max 
and tried to get the audience into 
the same state for Kappa Sig*s 
Hello Dolly.
Zoo Tunes came next. An un
professional, yet entertaining 
show, in the words of one sup
porter. Clad in Glad Bags, the 
Zoo crew took the stage with a 
show that was a success because 
of a dedication of five minutes of 
time, according to one brother.
The stage moved into more 
exotic locations with the final two 
performances before the intermis
sion. The first locale was Sig Taus 
balmy South Pacific. With a bar
bershop sextet, Sig Taus little 
sisters performed some of the best 
harmonies heard all night, as the 
men told the audience what every 
male CMU student knows, There 
Aint Nothing Like A Dame.
The first half ended with DTDs 
creepy Rocky Horror Show. SeeTartan file photo
Edye Tarbox and Dagney Hultgreen pose with emcees Don Michael and 
Lauren Howard
ing it was like watching the movie, 
except no toast or rice was seen 
anywhere on stage or in the audi
ence. In elaborate costumes, from 
Frankenfurter and Magenta down 
to the chorus, the Delts performed 
such numbers as Wild and an 
Untamed Thing, and the everpopular Time Warp.
DG kicked off the second half 
with selections from Mack and 
Mabel'. Were not the greatest 
singers, were not the greatest 
dancers, so we decided to work on 
our strong point - our sense of 
humor, confided Karyn Silva. 
Strong solos and an extensive set 
paced a show that simply wanted 
to make the world laugh.
The songs were more familiar 
with Pi Lams Blues Brothers. The 
show started with the obligatory 
rendition of Peter Gunn but 
quickly turned into a festival of 
rock and blues including A Little 
Respect and Jailhouse Rock.
Next were the final two sorori
ties, with homages to two differ
ent sports, baseball and sex. The 
TriDelts sang the laments of poor 
Washington Senator fans every
where, complaining about the 
Damn Yankees and near-sighted 
umpires.
Theta turned to the life of strip
per Gypsy Lee Rose with Gypsy. 
The show featured plenty of bump 
and grind, and the nights only 
lighted costume.
The first two of five fraternity
acts performed pieces from An
drew Lloyd Webbers more famous 
works.
Theta Xi started with an ambi
tious undertaking of The Phan
tom of the Opera with elaborate 
set and colorful costumes that 
transported the brothers to eight
eenth-century Vienna and its 
masked balls. The group per
formed numbers including Mas
querade.
Gathering enthusiastic ap
plause from the crowd during his 
solo of excerpts from Music of the 
Night, Jim Asbrand gave an 
excellent performance as the
sound effects at the end of tb 
segment made for a refreshintwist.

development of educational television
photo by Andy Gillespie
Keith Moore, Vice President for Educational Television, will develop 
television learning on the CMU campus and external sites.
By RUSS SELIGMAN
Tartan Business Manager
When Keith Moore sits at his 
desk thinking about TV, he isn't 
daydreaming, hes doing his job.
Last semester President 
Cyert appointed Moore to the 
newly-created position of Vice 
President for Educational Tele
vision. The concentration of 
Moores initial work is to get 
CMUs courses available offcampus, either on video tape or 
through live transmissions.
Through this program, other 
academic institutions and cor
porations will have access to 
Carnegie Mellon courses indi
rectly. These receiving sites will 
pay Carnegie Mellon a site li
cense or user fee in exchange for 
viewing information or record
ing rights.
Moore says that Carnegie 
Mellons educational programs 
could be of great benefit to 
people who are unable to physi
cally attend the University.
Its primarily an extension of 
the basic university mission to 
create and disseminate knowl
edge, Moore said. Its just some
thing thats in a different mode of 
operating than weve ever done in 
the past.
At the same time, however, he 
recognizes his responsibility to 
enrolled students. He plans to 
expand the library of videotaped
courses available on campus, 
similar to the program already 1 
in operation in the SUPA.
Almost all graduate classes 
at SUPA are recorded and ; 
stored in the Instructional 
Technologies facility. These 
courses may be checked out 
and viewed by students who ; 
missed a class or simply wish

oore heads educational TV
Inued from page L3
gview a lecture, 
f course, any such program 
ends on the support of the 
)0ls faculty. The success or 
jre of television at Carnegie 
Ion ... is wholly dependent on 
jty members approving of the 
getting actively involved in 
hingthe courses, and making 
ork, Moore said.
) far faculty reaction has been 
emely favorable. Moore has 
lucted interviews with almost 
iculty members, and says only 
e or four of them voiced opinagainst the idea. The rest 
been very enthusiastic. My 
ly indications are that a lot of 
jjle see a very good use for 
vision in education, he noted, 
oore has carefully screened 
Ity opinions concerning all of 
deas. He is first trying to find 
which courses faculty memwould be willing to teach, 
will then try to find institus which are interested in reing them. If the faculty 
nt want to do it, I dont have 
ogram, he said, 
esident Cyert has also apted an Advisory Board for 
cational Television to assist 
re in steering his programs, 
board is chaired by CIT Dean 
I Christiano, and has 14 regunembers from Carnegie Melfaculty and staff, 
with any new project, fundemains one main obstacle to 
come. The Universitys curlevel of willingness to invest 
le educational television prom, Moore says, is not good. 
result, the board has begun 
ieek funding from outside 
ces.
le method of enticing support 
industry is by offering dislts on user fees once the prois are established. Stanford 
-ersity, for example, has made
such an arrangement with Hewl
ett Packard.
According to Moore, Hewlett 
Packard wanted some of its engi
neers to obtain Masters degrees, 
but didnt want to lose the man
power in the interim. In exchange 
for funding, Stanford agreed to 
transmit the required courses 
directly to Hewlett Packards 
plant, and offered them reduced 
tuition fees.
Although it is too early in Car
negie Mellons program to have 
such sponsors, Moore expects the 
most likely candidates are com
panies which already have satel
lite receiving facilities, including 
IBM, Hewlett Packard, Alcoa, 
Xerox, Eastman Kodak and Digi
tal.
The field of educational televi
sion is not a new one, but it is 
currently in a stage of rapid 
growth. Penn State has transmit
ted courses on campus via closed 
circuit television for the last 30 
years, and has used microwaves 
to transmit off campus for 15 
years. In 1983 there were 100 
satellite receiver dishes in the 
United States. By 1988 that 
number had grown to 20,000; 
projections for 1990 are at 
100,000.
One project for the near future 
is the establishment of a televi
sion studio on campus. Our 
alumni have said for years that 
our drama students need more 
training to work in television, 
Moore said.
Other future projects include 
the acquisition of a satellite uplink 
station, which will allow direct 
transmission of signals to an or
biting satellite.
So many people are excited by 
television and the potential of 
television, Moore said. Theres 
just so much excitement about it 
that I cannot believe this idea is 
not ready to happen.

Tough Guys make a comeback
Dear Specs,
So where are the tough guys? 
I want one for a boyfriend.
On The Prowl
Dear OTP,
For many semesters being 
tough has been associated 
with stonewashed products, 
drinking whole milk and the 
ATO and Beta fraternity 
houses.
Not so anymore. Todays 
tough man image is more uni
versal.
Hes well-rounded, cute and 
multi-talented. He can listen 
to Madonna without comment
ing on her figure. He drinks 
beer and doesnt apply himself 
to the floor afterwards. He 
opens doors, helps girls out of 
their coats, and uses a knife 
with his fork.
Tough Man also has a more 
academic side. He is tough 
enough to do required reading 
before class, strive for a 3.0 
average and still find time to 
donate blood.
When he socializes (outside 
of the classroom, of course) he 
frequently remarks upon the 
weather and doesnt sneeze on 
his friends.
He rarely gets involved in 
fist fights and always recog
nizes the superiority of verbal 
debates regarding differences
of opinion.
If this sounds to you like an av
erage Pilam or A Phi O to you, you 
are sadly mistaken. It is a popu
lar myth that Pilams dont get 
into fights. In fact, they do, espe
cially when defending their bug
gies.
But todays Golden Tough Man 
doesnt. Atpartieshecan be heard 
repeating scores of great games 
or fun exams.
One occasionally spots a T.M. 
at a museum, ice cream parlor, or 
Brooks Brothers.
If you see one, dont be afraid to 
say Hi! Generally quite friendly, 
a real Tough Man knows when to 
shake hands.
If youre lucky he might even 
ask you for the time of day.
Dear Specs,
What is a girlfriend?
Scottie
Dear Scottie,
Dont worry, youd know if you 
had it.
Dear Specs,
Im worried about this whole 
substance abuse issue.
The peer pressure concept 
doesnt make sense. I dont know 
what my problem is.
Confused
Dear Confused,
At times it is difficult to get 
along with ones friends.
When they include remarks like 
Hi a little too frequently in con
versation, be firm.
Tell them you dont want to 
discuss Pittsburghs Famous In
cline any longer. When they ap
pear abusive remind them of the
Golden Rule.
Reminisce about the previ
ous administrations glorious 
JustSayNocampaign.Then, 
take them to the Kiltie Cafe. 
Recommend the entree of the 
day. While they are munch
ing away draw a visual paral
lel between the dish and their 
brain on drugs.
If these subtle hints fail to 
produce results, you need to 
spend some time away from 
the crowd.
Pick up a few books and 
stay home. Here are some sug
gestions:
Dieting: A Ten Year Plan, 
Kitty Dukakis. Serving sug
gestions that differ from the 
usual glass-of-water-whileswallowing old standby. In
troduction Choosing the 
Right Wine positively effer
vescent!
The Satanic Verses, S. 
Rushdie. Controversial, re
bellious. Truly flammable. 
The novel will spice up any 
barbeque.
New York on $1 a day, 
Darrel Strawberry. Ball 
player turned economist af
ter salary remains at $1.4 
million again this season.
Early Filers Get Early Re
funds, Ivan Boesky. Thriller 
set on Wall Street with ahero 
who tries to make it and keep 
it.
Indoor Soccer, Winnie Man
dela. How-to guide to playing 
team sports at home. Great 
reading for those rainy days 
that keep you trapped inside 
the house.
Pepsi 
commercial 
protested
continued from page L3
an elevated image of herself, Ma
donna not only runs the risk of 
insulting members of that faith 
but also of presenting herself as 
both pretentious and laughable.
It is no secret that music is a 
business, and in the end a music 
video is nothing more than a 
commercial for a song.
Some have managed to bring 
the music video to an art form, 
while others have merely used it 
to sell their product.
I do not think that there is any 
fault in either case. By the same 
token, I cannot pass judgement 
on the decision of artists such as 
Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, or 
Roberts Palmer and Plant to sell 
their songs to the commercial con
cerns.
In the case of every one of these 
singers, the songs which they 
donated to the beverage industry 
were representative of the prod
uct they were huckstering. Songs 
such as After Midnight or Tall 
Cool One pretend to be nothing 
more than the odes to sex, fun and 
rock and roll which they are.
However, when a song such as 
Like a Prayer appears in a Pepsi 
Cola commercial, heaving along 
with it all of the religious and 
racial issues with which it has 
become associated, the artist has 
not only compromised the mes
sage which she might have been 
trying to convey (however ques
tionable that message may be), 
but she has also cheapened the 
very same virtues which she has 
been pretending to expound.
No Coming Soons this week. 
Im in a bad mood.

By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Diversions Editor
The Activities Board is doing 
its part to make sure that 
March will be memorable by 
bringing Washington, D.C. 
band Not Even and comedian 
Rondell Sheridan to the Skibo 
Ballroom this weekend.
AB Dance will be presenting 
Not Even in the Ballroom at 
10 pm on Friday. Not Even, a 
D.C. progressive pop band, has 
been touted by critics and col
lege radio since their forma
tion in 1985. Recently, they 
have opened for Bob Marleys 
Wailers and Lone Justice.
According to the bands 
promo literature, their tightlyknit performances stem from 
the fact that for most of their 
three years as a group, they 
have shared living quarters. 
This gives them a unique, 
almost telepathic rapport, as 
well as a deep mutual con
tempt [sic] for one another.
big plans
Right. If the music of mutual 
contempt is your thing, check 
out Not Even at 10 pm on Fri
day.
Saturday at 8 pm, comedian 
Rondell Sheridan will be in 
the Ballroom, courtesy of AB 
Coffeehouse. Sheridan is a 
nationally known comedian 
who is a regular at New York 
Citys Improvisation and other 
popular clubs. Although pri
marily a comedian, Sheridan 
is also an actor  you may 
have seen him in a number of 
Levis 501 Blues commercials 
or as the lead performer in 
Stevie Wonders Part Time 
Lover video. Sheridan has 
also toured as an opener for 
Ray Charles.
Its going to be a hot week
end in the Ballroom, so dont 
miss a thing  get over to the 
AB Dance featuring Not Even 
on Friday and the AB Coffee
house starring Rondell Sheri
dan. Both events are sponsored 
by th Activities Board.
Touchstone Pictures presentsNEW YORK 
STORIES

Film collaboration makes the most of the
By DRUE MILLER
Tartan Copy Manager
There are some places that 
capture the imagination of gen
ius. When that genius belongs to 
three of the best film directors in 
the world, and when the place is 
the heart of New York City, then 
theres the opportunity for some 
cinematic magic.
New York Stories is an engag
ing trio of short films from Woody 
Allen, Martin Scorsese, and 
Francis Ford Coppola. These men 
are among the most popular di
rectors in contemporary filmmak
ing. Through their differing char
acterizations of relationships, life
styles, and settings, the stories 
weave together a stunning view 
of life in the big city.
Scorsese features art scene
Life Lessons is Martin (The Last 
Temptation of Christ) Scorseses 
contribution. A beautifully filmed, 
frenetically paced piece, Life Les
sons presents us with Lionel Dobie 
(played by one very shaggy Nick 
Nolte), a talented artist driven by 
his neuroses. His 22-year-old livein assistant/lover Paulette (Ro
sanna Arquette) is leaving him, 
and what we see are Lionels 
wrenching attempts to win her 
back. What she ever saw in him 
isnt very clear (aside from the 
obvious apprentice/mentor rela
tionship), and why shed want to 
stay is even less understandable. 
Lionel is a bit crazy and highly 
unstable, and Paulette is prone to 
such bitchiness that its perhaps 
even more difficult to understand 
why he wants her to stay.
Paulette leaves. Lionel runs 
after her. Paulette causes a scene. 
Lionel lies to her, locks her in a 
bathroom, and starts a fight. 
Paulette screams, curses, and 
humiliates him in public. Lionel 
apologizes, over and over, I love 
you darlin, Id do anything for 
you. I just get a little crazy some
times.... Inane, yes, but irra
tional terrain is something we all 
identify with in the course of 
emotional upheaval.
When he isnt chasing after her, 
hes painting, and its in these 
scenes that the tension really 
shows. Lionels loft is vast enough 
for him to play basketball in 
(which he does, pausing occasion
ally to stare at Paulettes room), 
and also acoustically perfect, as
the music pouring out of his paint
laden stereo will tell you. It is 
when hes painting that Lionel 
comes most alive, all the anger 
and frustrations roaring over onto 
his canvas. Watching Lionels 
paintings evolve is like watching 
one of those ultra-slow-motion 
films of a raindrop hitting a leaf, 
with cymbals and kettle drums 
crashing in the background, and 
realizing just how devastating 
small forces can be. Every splotch 
of paint, every swipe of his brush 
adds up to a tremendously power
ful force.
Photography Director Nestor 
Almendros did an outstanding job 
of capturing the feel of Lionels 
work and passion. He and Scors
ese have taken a wildly sprawling 
chunk of reality and wound it into 
a tightly elegant little ball of 
neuroses that jangles and flinches 
at all the right moments.
Coppola misses with glitz
Francis Coppola + NYC = havoc 
on a grand and glittering scale 
and a budget that would make 
the Pentagonjealous. Then again, 
what could you expect from the 
person who made such visually
overwhelming works as Apoca
lypse Now, The Cotton Club, and 
Koyaanisqatsi? Coppolas Life 
Without Zoe, while shorter than a 
feature film, spares nothing in 
the great glitterati dept.
Life without Zoe could easily be 
retitled Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Prepubescent. Zoe Montez 
(Heather McComb) is 12 years 
old, although shed be the last to 
admit it. She lives in the posh 
Sherry-Netherland Hotel while 
her world-famous flautist father 
Claudio (whom she addresses by 
his first name: how precious!) 
performs around the world and 
her mother Charlotte (another 
first-namer) goes to parties 
around the world. Zoe is looked 
after by Hector the butler (Don 
Novello, aka Father Guido Sarducci), although its clear from 
the start that no one is really in 
charge of this girl.
We get to watch a typical day 
for Zoe: Hectorwakesherup, feeds 
her breakfast in bed, and helps 
her decide which Chanel to wear 
while she opens her parents mail. 
Late for school, she dashes off, 
stopping briefly to withdraw $50 
from her hotel bank account in 
case I miss the bus to school
(which she does). As her cab pulls 
up in front of the Fieldston School, 
Zoe hops out and spies a new 
student  Abu, a little boy from 
an unnamed OPEC country, sur
rounded by turbaned body guards. 
Zoe and her clique interview Abu 
for the school paper. During the 
interview he divulges such tanta
lizing details as 1) his father is 
one of the richest men in the world, 
2) hes talked to Morgan Fairchild 
on the phone, and 3) he doesnt 
wear socks. Abu also admits to 
having no companions his own 
age. Somehow, thats not hard to 
believe at all.
A subplot involving an earring 
given to Claudio by a princess 
(who just happens to be Abus 
aunt) is awkwardly threaded into 
the film. For reasons unknown, 
the earring must be returned; why 
it hasnt been returned yet is a 
mystery. So, Zoe concocts a plan 
to settle the matter; have a cos
tume party at Abus and invite 
the whole school. Zoe can quietly 
return the earring, and Abu might 
even make a few friends in the 
process.
The party is a showcase for 
Coppolas love of gaudiness. Call 
me crazy, but 400 small children
location
decked out in costumes, feasting 
on flaming dishes, dancing to a 
live band and watching a private 
circus/dance review is a bit much, 
especially for an apartment in 
NYC (even if it is on Central Park 
West). I groaned through most of 
the film (being from theninglamorous suburbs), but my compan
ion (a NYC hotel brat himself) 
found no end of amuserrfefit in it.
The most memorable bitfof dia
logue comes upon Charlottes 
unannounced return, where she 
finds her daughter and a dozen 
friends indulging themselves. 
Charlotte walks in, eyes suddenly 
very open, and screeches, This is 
your idea of sophistication? 
Twelve-year-olds drinking straw
berry daiquiris and reading Paris 
Vogue? And wearing my ear
rings?! Throughout the movie, 
one thing was clear: it was way 
past Zoes bedtime.

Photographers retrospective at the CMU Art Gallery...Winogrand exhibit showing on Craig St.
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Staffwriter
A retrospective of the photogra
phy of Garry Winogrand is show
ing at the Carnegie Mellon Art 
Gallery. The show will run until 
April 16.
Winogrands work deals with 
emotions and actions captured 
from everyday life. Most of the 
pictures were taken on streetcorners in New York City. Win
ogrand successfully captures the 
essence of the moment with his 
photographs.
The 200 images in the show, 
including ten contact sheets en
larged to 6 feet by 6 feet, are 
organized into nine roughly 
chronological segments docu
menting the stages of Winogrands 
career. Represented among the 
settings and subject matter that 
fascinated him are the categories 
of: the Eisenhower Years, The 
Street, Women, The Zoo, On the 
Road, The Sixties, The Fort Worth 
Fat Stock Show and Rodeo, The
m@G yE?A !s^@ EE~a eIl e8 myl vyemebunvy3 Eo 'nuuo TaIebunIs eI l,yaEam nm myl Vh 1um 'nCCluoz
Airport, and Unfinished Work. 
The last section of the exhibition 
consists of approximately 25 
prints and 40 slides from the vast 
body of workmore than 300,000 
exposures  left unfinished at 
the time of Winogrands death in 
1984. The exhibition represents
the most inclusive showing to date 
of Winogrands remarkable pho
tographic achievements.
The exhibition is accompanied 
by Winogrand: Fragments From 
the Real World, a 260-page pub
lication compiled by the Museum 
of Modern Art. Copies can be pur
chased at the Gallery.
The Carnegie Mellon Art Gal
lery is located at 407 S. Craig 
Street. Gallery hours are Tues
day-Friday 10-5, Saturday 11-5, 
and Sunday 1-4. Admission to the 
exhibition is free. For more infor
mation call the Gallery at x3110.

Our intrepid critic is Yoko Onoed into submission
You arent gonna believe what 
happened to me in New York City.
No, I wasnt mugged. It was worse 
than that. No, I didnt get slashed 
by a Bellevue escapee. It was 
worse than that. No, I didnt have 
to watch any Broadway plays with 
Ed Asner in em. No, youve got to 
imagine the very worst thing that 
couffiEappen to a tourist in New 
YorS City.
Thats right.
I went to the exhibition at the 
Whitney Museum called Yoko 
Ono:;Qfejects and Films.
J j'iiStiame out of intensive care 
andXthink I can finally start to 
talk about it, try to put all the 
pieces-logether, get my life going 
agaifhjXeimne see, where can I 
startrfco -tell this?
Okay,Til start with the apple.
In 1966, Yoko set a green apple on 
a pedestal at the Indica Gallery 
and;,askfed someone in the audienc ttTtake a bite out of it. Now 
listen to me. Sometimes I make 
things up. Im not making this up.
THEY -HAD THE APPLE ON 
DISPLAY. THE SAME APPLE.
THE APPLE FROM 23 YEARS 
AGO. THEY PRESERVED IT! IT 
STILL:HAS THE ICKY OOZY 
BITE IN IT!
And'Iunderneath it, on a little 
cardrit-says Apple, 1966.
Im sorry, I dont have jokes for 
this material.
How-about the Yoko Ono glass 
ball? Thats all it is, a glass ball, 
on another pedestal. The little 
card says This sphere will be a 
sharp point when it gets to the far 
side ofthe room in your mind.
Yoko, listen to me. No, it wont.
NYC is 
excellent 
locale 
for films
continued from page Lll
a neurotic middle-aged lawyer 
arid his badgering mother, Sadie 
Mills?m (who wont forgive her 
son for dropping the last syllable).
SKeldon (played by Allen) is 
caught between his new love, Lisa, 
and his mother (What? A shiksa 
with three kids?). Mia Farrows 
performance as Lisa is admittedly 
lackluster, but never so much as 
when shes near Sadie (Mae 
Questel, also known as the voice 
of ;Betty Boop). And you thought 
YOU had a Jewish mother? Oy!
Sadie is every Jewish mother 
stereotype youve ever heard - 
pijshy, nagging, smothering, 
bajbying. Forget all the Jewish 
mothers in Allens other films - 
this one is worse. Sheldons cring
ing haplessness and Sadies re
lentless nagging create an over
whelming sense of tension (tinged 
with a little sympathy for both of 
them), the sort that makes you 
squirm until you leave the the
atre. What happens between 
Sadie, Sheldon and Lisa is so 
utterly silly, its devastating. The 
rest of the film is just too deli
ciously funny to reveal. Trust me 
- youll laugh.
An odd lot of well-knowns make 
fleeting cameo appearances in all 
three of these films. Watch closely 
and you might see the following:
P^ter Gabriel and Debbie Harry 
in [Life Lessons; Chris (Late Night 
w\th David Letterman) Elliot in 
Life Without Zoe\ and Hizzoner 
E(i Koch, Mayor of New York, in 
Oedipus Wrecks. The views ofthe 
city are rich and varied; from 
Central Park and SoHo to Tavern 
oii the Green, the Russian Tea 
Room, and Bloomies, the films 
start to look a bit like an extended 
I^NY ad - but with plots, and 
(mostly) excellent ones at that. If 
youre homesick for NYC, New 
York Stories may be the quickest 
form of relief to be found in Pitts
burgh.
New York Stories opened in 
Pittsburgh last Friday. Check 
local listings for theatres and 
times.
Should I mention that immor
tal Yoko Ono work Four Spoons? 
Why is it bronzed? Glad that 
you asked. Yoko wrote all up and 
down one side of the wall to ex
plain EXACTLY why it was 
bronzed. It was bronzed because 
last year she went to a restored 
palace outside Leningrad. Each 
restored room had two photo
graphs on the wall  one taken in 
the czarist period and the other 
taken after the room had been 
bombed by the Nazis. The three 
states of the room  two in past 
and one in the present  were 
totally different; only the IDEA of 
the room remained the same. 
Okay, got that? When she got 
back to New York City, she was 
eating out at an Italian restau
rant when a friend said to her I 
think you should work in bronze. 
Yoko instantly burst into tears, 
because this man didnt under
stand my art. Later she decided 
that the bronze was very eighties, 
so she took all her sixties art works 
and bronzed them. Thats why 
there is a Four Spoons and a 
BRONZE Four Spoons.
Im sorry I cant describe each 
individual object in the show to 
you. Youll certainly wanna fork 
over the $4.50 and see it yourself. 
Im also sorry that I missed Yokos 
1963 concert piece Wall Piece for
Orchestra, in 
which, to quote from 
the program, Ono 
knelt on the stage 
and repeatedly hit 
her head against the 
floor, raising ques
tions about the na
ture of personal violation and 
violence.
What I would like to share with 
you, however, is a 25-minute 
movie of Yokos called Fly. For 
25 minutes you watch a fly crawl 1 
all over a nekkid ladys body. And 
I mean, in 25 minutes, that fly hit 
every single INCH of that 
womans bod. There were about 
50 people in the Whitney Mu
seum film room watching this 
movie, and there were only three 
of us that were 1 aughing. Im sorry, 
but I couldnt help it. Theres a 
point where youve got to say, Oh 
no, please NOOOOO, dont let that 
fly go in THERE! Oh, please, 
STOP it, STOP! Like I say, the 
fly goes everywhere, accompanied 
by Yokos lyrical Japanese moan
ing, which sounds roughly like 
eight cats being repeatedly ham
mered over the head with a suit
case. Id like to tell you about her 
other movie, No. 2 (Bottoms), 
which is 80 solid minutes of 
closeups of peoples butts, but 
every man has his limit. Two 
breasts. Aperfect 100 on the Vomit 
Meter. Yoko Fu.
Speaking of brutal assault, 
Kinjite is the latest Bronson 
revenge flick, but Big Chuck 
phones in his performance and 
theres not much real action and 
it doesnt really make sense, but

other than that its fine. Siskel 
and Ebert jumped all over the 
movie because its exploitative 
on the subject of teen prostitu
tion, but the teen hookers are 
reeject sitcom actresses that 
couldnt get a Turkish sailor ex
cited, much less a drive-in vet
eran. The idea is that Bronson is 
out to bust the number-one childporn pimp in El Lay whos just 
kidnapped a Japanese girl who 
happens to be the same age as 
Bronsons daughter, and who 
happens to be the daughter of the 
Japanese businessman who 
fondled Bronsons daughter on a 
bus. Unfortunately, all Asians
look alike to Bronson and his 
daughter, and so Bronson has to 
keep busting up the wrong opera
tion, kung-fuing porno directors 
left and right, tossing pimps off 
ninth-story balconies, burning up 
pimpmobile Cadillacs for fun, and 
 in the most disgusting scene in 
the movie  forcing a guy to eat a

?MU alumnus featured in local theatre...

Tartan Staffwriter
The New Group Theatre apjroaches the mid-point of its sev,nth season with the production 
3f Anatol by Arthur Schnitzler. 
Written at the turn of the cen;ury, the setting of this play is 
/ienna in the early 1900s.
Anatol is a romantic comedy 
ibout a man named Anatol, a 
nan of the leisure class at the 
jrink of the modern era. Without 
vork or religion to keep him busy, 
Anatol passes the time by having 
nultiple affairs.
The entire play is set in seven 
cenes, each showing Anatol with
different woman. We see these 
iffairs in every possible state  
n the beginning, at the end, after 
in attempt was made, looking 
jack and, yes, currently in prog
ress. In watching the seven scenes 
ve can see the variety of love, and 
ve develop an understanding of 
in entire society at a critical point 
n history.
Anatol is an artist of love but he 
jelieves blindly in art for arts 
sake. The play has been described 
a superbly skillful and nearly 
jainless dissection of the human 
leart.
Therese Parks, director of Anaol and a member of The New 
Jroup Theatre describes Anatol 
is A man falling in love with 
ove. He is a very emotional man. 
Thats part of his charm, part of 
vhat attracts so many women to 
lim. He can lift you up or he can 
urn on you, and he does, with his 
harms.
Parks, although well-known to 
ocal audiences as a versatile 
ictress, will make her debut as 
he director of a full-length work 
rith this piece. She will be the 
irst one to admit that directing is
New Group presents Anatol
not one of her favorite things but 
she has, in the past, directed 
several one-acts at the New Group 
and has co-directed with Martin 
Giles, another member of the New 
Group.
Parks first got the script for 
Anatol about three months ago 
and after reading it for about three 
weeks she was ready for more 
reading. In directing for the New 
Group, Parks says that she has 
to make sure [the actors] are going 
in the right direction to get the 
overall objective of the play. 
These people work together in 
every production and are all 
equally familiar with the plays 
but their interpretations of the 
different characters can vary.
As a director, one needs a firm 
idea ofthe play. After some study
ing of the playwright, Arthur Sch
nitzler, Parks is led to believe 
that the play is somewhat auto
biographical. Schnitzler himself 
was notorious for his many af
fairs and he is known to have kept 
two mistresses up until at least 
the age of 60.
Of The New Group Theatre, 
Parks describes it as a true expe
rience. Many have mentioned to 
her that they consider the New 
Groupa lot like off-off-Broadway 
but she thinks theyre a little 
better than that. The New Group 
Theatre has been at its present 
location for several years but is 
looking forward to a possible 
change of address in the near 
future. Starting from scratch, the 
theatre is only now beginning to 
receive grants and other types of 
financial support as they try to 
gain a wider financial base. Al
though they really like the Bloom
field/Garfield area, they will have 
to move due to the size of their 
current facilities. The members 
of the New Group do just about all

The Pittsburgh Center for the 
\rts is home to many of the areas 
iber (fabric) artists. Wearing a 
Vork of Art is an exhibition of 
heir work that is now on display 
n the Clifford Gallery at the 
Center. It contains pieces such as 
rimonos, jackets, jeans, jewelry, 
md many other wearable items. 
The Center decided to declare 
rearable art as the theme for the 
month, and they tied the show in 
vith the article now running in 
he Arts, magazine, a monthly 
publication. The article describes 
vearable art as a challenge ... a 
Jne-of-a-kind art. It has roots in 
)oth ancient decorative art and 
ate 20th century social protest... 
tis at once the singular, personal 
statement of the artist who cre
ated it and the person who has 
:hosen to wear it.
Cynthia Lambert, the Vice'resident of the Fiber Arts Guild, 
las the pleasure of having her 
reations, which include the 
rimonos for which she is well 
^nown , on display in the show. 
Vith a BA in Art from Notre Dame 
College in Baltimore, Cynthia 
lecame a social worker in the late 
', when there were not a lot of 
obs available for art majors. In 
mid-70s she attended an 
international Fiber Show in Pitts
burgh, where she witnessed wild, 
vonderful sculptures that helped 
[urn her towards fiber art. 
Cynthia is about to finish her 
foree year term as Vice President 
>fthe Fiber Arts Guild. The Guild 
jonsists of about 200 members, 
nany of whom have national 
eputations for their work. Memters can range from people interi in textile as a hobby to proessional artists. There is a rigid 
Greening process for admission; 
;ach artist is evaluated very careully on his/her use of color, de>ign, and technique.
Every year the Guild has a 
nembership show, and this Sep
tember there will be an Interna
tional Fiber Show, which is held 
every other year. Cynthia de
scribes the Guild as dedicated to 
educating its members, and giv
ing Pittsburgh a view of excel
lence in textile arts.
Cynthia describes her wearable 
art as very personal, relating to 
experiences she has had in the 
past or to what is going on in her 
life now. Each piece makes a dif
ferent statement. These include 
womens issues, politics, the en
vironment, and humor.
In Wearing a Work of Art one 
can see Cynthias hand painted 
dresses, scarves, and kimonos. 
One silk kimono on display en
titled Mona Deitch was deco
rated using dyes and textile paint. 
The kimono can be enjoyed by 
being displayed on a wall, taken 
down to be worn, and returned to 
the wall. Another of her works, a 
dress entitled American Dream, 
deals with personal imagery. If 
one looks closely, one can see 
houses, trees, and poetry present 
in the intricate design.
When Cynthia is not working 
in her studio, she teaches classes 
in surface design in fiber art at 
the Center. She is very proud of 
her work and wants it known that 
the wearable art is not the 1989 
Spring fashions, but items that 
can be worn and appreciated for 
years to come.
There will be over fifty works of 
art on display at the Wearing a 
Work of Art show and many will 
be for sale, with prices ranging 
from about sixty dollars to a few 
thousand dollars. Some artists 
whose work will be shown are 
Leonoor Zehner, showing an In
dia ink drawn brooch, Elena Mesa, 
showing a hand painted silk 
jacket, and Roberta Weisberg, 
showing a gold leather cape.
The Pittsburgh Center for the 
Arts is located at 6300 Fifth Ave, 
Mellon Park. Wearing a Work of 
Art began March 4 and runs 
through April 9. Art classes are 
open to all ages. For information 
call the Center at 361-0873. The 
Center is closed on Mondays.

Sonic Temple hosts Happy Flowers
By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
Alright, its two weeks to Spring 
Break, your grades are in the 
toilet, you have a few billion pages 
of work due the day after you get 
back, and your cat is spying on 
you. Might as well go see some 
rock and roll, and this is a good 
week for it.
The Replacements are going to 
be in town tomorrow, playing at 
the Graffiti along with Johnny 
Rhythm and the Dimestore 45s, 
the band with the big name. While 
the Replacements latest LP, Dont 
Tell A Soul, sounds remarkably 
like Bryan Summer-Of-69- 
When-I-Was-About-ElevenYears-Old Adams, the Replace
ments live shows have a good 
reputation for raucousness (raucousity?). (Their legal bootleg 
cassette, When the Shit Hits The 
Fans, which comes from their 
post-Lei It Be tour, is a landmark 
in live recordings - the boozed-up 
band bangs through various parts 
of over thirty tunes, theirs and 
others, playing as much as they 
can remember and stopping, 
sometimes all at the same time.) 
Anyway, I dont think they could 
have gotten completely boring - 
there are three other people in 
the band besides Paul Westerbergso the show might be worth 
checking out.
Thursday, all you folks of legal 
age, or you folks willing to bluff 
your way in, should head down to 
the Decade to check out the Tail 
Gators. Its one of those rare occa
sions when neither Norm Nardini nor Billy Price is playing there 
(an event in itself), and this time 
the bands even good. The Tail 
Gators play this nifty mishmash 
of Mississippi blues and rock and 
roll that smooshes anything 
remotely like it, and you can dance 
to it, too. Besides, even if you hate 
it (highly unlikely), youll be able
Music Music Music 
In 
Review
to booze it up, which always makes 
the band sound better, and in this 
case should make the band posi
tively lethal. Should be cheap, 
and Warren King is opening, so 
you can get there late.
Friday night you dont have any 
excuse. Go to the Sonic Temple. 
Government Issue is at the Sonic 
Temple. Government Issue is a 
rock band (spelled rokk). Gov
ernment Issue is a very good rock 
band. Government Issue is possi
bly the best rock band presently 
in existence. Government Issue 
has been trying to break up for 
most of their existence, and might 
finally do it sometime soon. You 
should see this band before that 
happens. (You didnt believe me 
about Winterblast, and look what 
happened then. This is like that.) 
If you want a sample of Govern
ment Issue (or G.I. for those of us 
who are tired of typing), they have 
a new E.P. out. It has some studio 
stuff, like a remix of Strange 
Wine off of their Crash LP (the 
E.P. is the Strange Wine E.P., 
anyway), as well as a few redone 
tunes off their first seven-inchers 
that you cant find anymore. But, 
most importantly, it has LIVE 
G.I.! Whoop!
Saturday, you can wake up late, 
have a nice leisurely brunch, just 
generally take it easy, and then 
go back to the Sonic Temple that 
evening to see Happy Flowers, 
Sister Ray, and Thin White Line. 
While an entire set of Happy 
Flowers could be kinda tense, this 
is another band that you should 
at least hear before you leave 
school (youknow, expanding your

Aprils thaw, but include a few

tyl tnumnI P VnuIlbal hlCCeI P 4c hnugy 49k9~4!Its time for Terry Gilliam
jjy STEPHEN GLICKER
'artan Staffwriter
Terry Gilliam, one of the resient geniuses of Monty Pythons 
}lying Circus, has just released 
third movie, The Adventures 
f Baron Munchausen. Although 
his flick has not yet reached us 
ay out here in Pittsburgh, it will 
hortly, and it seems only fitting 
get ready for his third masterjiece on the big screen by reviewig his other two cinematic works 
fart, Time Bandits and Brazil. 
Now I know that there are very 
people out there who have not 
>en Time Bandits. However, this 
novie came out eight years ago 
nd it probably has been quite 
Dine time since you have seen it 
ist. I highly recommend seeing 
again, for now that you are 
Ider and more mature you will 
few it in a new light.
For those of you who have not 
en it, or have just forgotten the 
lot over the years, here it is. It 
iings with a little boy named 
ievin (Craig Wamock) who goes 
bed one night, and suddenly a 
night on horseback bursts out of 
s bedroom closet. Before long 
>vin has joined up with a group 
six comical dwarves who used 
manufacture shrubbery. These 
ivarves, it seems, have stolen of 
map which gives the location of 
[1 the holes in time and space 
om the Supreme Being. They 
ion use these holes, and drop in 
the adventures of Napoleon 
an Holm), King Agamemnon 
lean Connery), Robin Hood (John 
leese), and sail on the Titanics 
aiden voyage.
Not only is the Supreme Being 
ter them to get the map back, 
it so is Prime Evil (David 
jamer). Prime Evil eventually 
icks the gang into going to the 
me of Legends to try and find 
le most valuable possession in 
le universe, and they promptly
get themselves caught. Now all 
they have to do is rescue them
selves from certain death, get the 
map back, destroy Prime Evil, 
and get out of the Time of Leg
ends  hey, no problem.
Time Bandits is a terrific movie. 
The action is exciting and non
stop, the acting is top-notch, and 
the film is visually stunning, 
second only to Brazil. Gilliam has 
a very warped mind, which can 
easily be seen in the cartoons he 
does for Flying Circus, but watch
ing this movie is like watching an 
artists subconscious at work. All 
the performances are excellent, 
but Sir Ralph Richardson takes 
the cake as the Supreme Being. 
Time Bandits is Monty Python 
meets The Wizard ofOz, The Time 
Machine, and Snow White.
Brazil is another frequently 
seen movie here at CMU, not only 
because of its controversial issues 
and the simple fact that it is a 
great movie, but also because is a 
requirement for a lot of English 
classes here.
For those of you out there who 
have either been on an island the 
past four years, never have taken 
an English class in your life, or 
still cant understand this movie, 
here we go. In Brazil, society is 
mean and grim, controlled by a 
monolithic organization, where 
citizens lead lives of paranoia and 
oppression.
The hero ofBrazil is Sam Lowry 
(Jonathan Pryce), a lowly clerk in 
the Ministry of Information Re
trieval who works at 
a computer terminal 
all day (sounds like 
a few people I know 
here). His life is drab 
and boring, and his 
only means of escape 
is by sometimes 
cheating when the 
boss isnt looking 
and switching the 
screen of his com
puter to reruns of exciting old TV 
programs or through his glorious 
fantasies of flying high above the 
world urged on by the vision of a 
beautiful woman.
Through a number of odd and 
surrealistic coincidences, Sam be
comes involved with terrorists 
challengingthe opressive system. 
From here on the movie becomes 
extremely complex and hard to 
follow (not that it wasnt hard 
enough already), and one almost 
has to reach out for the rewind 
button to get the full effect. Sam 
eventually finds out that his best 
friend Jack (Michael Palin) is a 
government torturer, and the 
leader of the revolutionaries is a 
heating and airconditioning re
pairman who defies the state by 
goingaroundfixingthings (Robert 
De Niro).
The story of Brazil, as elabo
rate asitis, pales beside the sheer 
cinematic artistry of this movie. 
The film is just packed with elabo
rate special effects, sensational 
sets, and apocalyptic scenes of de
struction. In the world of Brazil 
everything is dark and dismal 
Oookfor the everpresent ductwork 
and pipes), and the buildings have 
sub-sub-subbasements. Gilliams 
world seems awfully familiar.
Universal objected so strongly 
to the films dark tone and quasi
downbeat ending that they tried 
to force Gilliam to totally re-edit 
his movie, or surrender it to them. 
When Gilliam refused, the studio
would not release Brazil, that is
London has one... 
New York has one... 
Chicago has one... 
Now Pittsburgh has one!

Jonathan Pryce dons his fantasy armor and wings in Brazil.
until it won the LA Film Critics 
Award for Best Picture before its 
official release. Even after all of 
that, some American versions 
contain some scenes not in the 
British release, and vice versa.
However, Brazil is available in 
the Hunt Library for viewing, and
I believe they have the complete, 
uncut version. I can not recom
mend seeing this movie highly 
enough.

Memories of Underdevelopment
This political drama about bourgeios alienation in 
revolutionary Cuba was made in 1968 by Tomas 
Gutierrez Alea, and brought to the United States in 
1973. Perhaps not the most mainstream of films, but 
still worth the $1.

U2 Rattle and Hum
U2s first concert film consists mostly of songs 
from the Joshua Tree album, and a few new ones. The 
movie has its moments  Bono singing with a gospel 
:choir in Harlem, and a visit to Elvis Presleys 
Graceland Estate  but the rest is typical concert 
footage. U2 Rattle and Hum offers some back-stage 
insight into the band and its goals, but the film is not 
much in comparison to seeing the group live on stage.

Married to the Mob
This comedy stars Matthew Modine as an under
cover FBI agent investigating activities of the Mafia, 
and Michelle Pfeiffer as the widow of an Italian 
rpobster. Modine romances Pfeiffer to get information 
about his investigation, and  surprise!  they fall 
in love. The adventures they go through as a result of 
their predicament are funny and entertaining and 
the movie ends happily ever after. Great perform
ances from Modine and Pfeiffer, as well as from Dean 
Stockwell, as the amorous Tony The Tiger Russo, a 
mob chieftain, and Mercedes Ruehl, as his wife Angela. 
Directed by Jonathan (Stop Making Sense) Demme, 
the film also has an incredible soundtrack featuring 
New Order, Debbie Harry, and Brian Eno.

The Graduate
Its back. Once again, the all-time favorite comingof-age film, starring Dustin Hoffman, comes to cam
pus. The story finds Hoffman seduced by Anne Ban
croft, but in love with her daughter, Katharine Ross. 
Obviously, this causes problems for everyone, espe
cially Hoffman. Mike Nichols won an academy award 
for directing this film, and it is good enough to see 
many times over. Even if you dont like the film, you 
cant resist enj oying the fantastic soundtrack by Simon 
and Garfunkel.

Michelle Pfeiffer looks anxious in Married to the Mob.
We pursue those trivial, idiotic 
technological encumbrances and 
imagine them to be the luxuries 
that make life worth living, and all 
the time we are losing our poten
tial for social rather than individ
ual survival, for hating as well as loving, 
losing perhaps one last chance to enjoy 
life with all the passion that is our nature
