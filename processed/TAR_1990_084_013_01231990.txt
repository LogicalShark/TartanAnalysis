Favored candidate may stay at Stanford
Presidential search group finds candidates interest weaning in interview
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
Jim Gibbons might be Carnegie 
Mellons next president.
Then again, he might not.
I dont have any intense desire 
to be president of any institu
tion, says the dean of Stanfords 
Engineering School, who was
considered the favored candi
date in the CMU search as re
cently as late October.
In fact, some of the search 
committee members wanted to 
make an offer to Gibbons, accord
ing to Faculty Search Committee 
Chair John Fetkovich.
At one point it even appeared 
that some form of an offer had
been made; last October, Vice 
President for Enrollment William 
Elliott said, To the best of my 
knowledge, we have made an of
fer that I think is appropriate. 
William Goldsmith, a member 
of the Trustee Search Commit
tee, says that this candidate met 
with the Steering Committee late 
last year to determine what his
receptivity would be to accepting 
an offer ... if one were made.
His answer? He did not ex
press the same level ofinterest as 
he did in the beginning [of the 
search],"say s Steven Fenves of the 
Faculty Search Committee.
Gibbons says, though, that hes 
just not sure he wants to be a 
president. He describes his as
cent to his current position as a 
Stanford dean as prompted by his 
loyalty to Stanford, not by aspira
tions to climb in any institutions 
hierarchy.
Im not a dean now because Im 
trying to be on track to become a 
president, he says. I had oppor
tunities to do other things and

Pete Jones, an associate profes
sor of English at Carnegie Mel
lon, took a sabbatical in Laguna 
Beach, California to do some 
writing.
Now he has something to write 
about.
About five years ago, respond
ing to a magazine ad, J ones began 
correspondence with Keith 
Goodman, a prisoner in an Indi
ana penitentiary. Goodman was 
released in December, 1988, only 
to be arrested again last Sunday. 
Goodman was arrested at Jones 
California home and then charged 
with the murder of four people 
connected with some of his other 
prison pen-pals.
Jones recounts how he was in
trigued with Goodmans situation. 
He had a pretty raw deal with 
life. His father left him when he 
was three and he never got along
with his mother. His only other 
living relative, who has died since 
Goodmans release from prison, 
was his grandmother.
I saw him both while he was in 
the penitentiary and after he got 
out. I even engaged a lawyer to 
assist him to get his time reduced. 
I have visited him after he got 
out, and I knew he was having a 
terrible time adjusting to what 
most people think of as real life. 
He had been incarcerated since 
he was 17 and he was about 29 
when he got out. He had no skills, 
and always expressed interest in 
changing his life around, so I tried 
to counsel him and help him to 
figure out the best paths to take. 
Since Goodmans release, Jones 
maintained periodic contact with 
him, explaining in a recent Christ
mas card about his California 
sabbatical. Then on January 10, 
as Jones recounts, He called me 
from Oklahoma City, and told me

The first major gift to the Uni

been made by Carnegie Mellon 
Trustee Thomas McConomy and 
his wife Eileen. Both are Carne
gie Tech alumni.
The $1 million donation will be
givenoverthe course offouryears. 
McConomy said that a little over 
a quarter of the money has al
ready been delivered to the Uni
versity in the form of securities 
whichhe thinks have already been 
sold.
He said that he and his wife 
wanted to make [the gift] to 
something we thought was im

he met with Carnegie Mellon 
President Richard Cyert in No
vember and was told that the 
Universitys top priority was the 
University Center, the McConomys decided to make the gift.
Tom has been a very active 
supporter of the University, said 
Vice President for University
Planning Patrick Keating.
McConomy said that his gift 
was not tagged for any particular 
part of the University Center. He 
did not want to try to microman
age the project he said. He also 
said that as far as he knows, no 
part of the Center will be named 
after him or his wife.
McConomy graduated from
Carnegie Tech in 1955 with a 
degree in chemical engineering 
and took a job with Calgon Car

of the company after he and four 
other executives bought it in1985.

A pilot program for the recy

The program, which placed 250

Rosenblum, a CIT senior, de

Dining Service switches 
from Styrofoam to paper
bv sMF9JM FMdf/
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons Dining Serv
ice has recently made the switch 
from styrofoam to biodegradable 
paper disposables in an effort to 
become more environmentally 
conscious.
According to CMDS Director 
James Gurley, the change to 
paper will cost the University 
about $8,000 per semester. The 
prices of small, medium, and 
large soft drinks will be raised 
five cents to offset the additional 
cost. The price of the extra-large 
size will not be effected.
The switch was possible be
cause of Dining Services success 
in finding a new vendor who of
fered the products needed by 
Dining Service grouped at a dis
count. The cost of converting to 
paper could have driven up the 
prices 25 to 30 percent.
Dining Service will be using
these paper products in all of 
their operations, including the 
Tartan Grill and MorePizza. In 
the change from styrofoam to 
paper, more than 20 of 100 dis
posable products were replaced.
There are many advantages 
to the new paper products. One 
is that they are superior to sty
rofoam in biodegradability. This 
means that they will decompose 
quickly. In the short ran, which 
is about 100 years, there will be 
less paper than styrofoam.
Paper can also be compressed 
to a greater extent than styro
foam. This is good because the 
nations landfills are filling 
quickly. An anthropologist at the 
University of Arizona found that 
the styrofoam packaging most 
fast foods come in accounts for 
about 0.26 percent of thelandfills 
by weight and 0.27 percent by 
volume.

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Deep Thought beats Scottish 
master, captures Levy prize
; Carnegie Mellons top-ranked chess-playing computer, Deep 
Thought, beat Scottish international master David Levy, 4-0, in 
"a four-game match played from December 11-14 at Londons Brit
ish Computer Society. Deep Thoughts creators, five Carnegie 
^Mellon computer graduate science students, split a $5,000 prize 
known as the Levy Challenge. $1,000 of the prize was given by 
Levy himself, while the other $4,000 came from Omni magazine, 
which offered that amount to the first computer to beat Levy.
Deep Thought was not Levys first non-human opponentlate 
in the 60s he proclaimed that he would be able to beat any com
puter challengers for at least a decade. Between 1974 and 1984 
he beat all five of the chess-playing computers that rose to his 
challenge. He hadnt played a computer chess machine in the five 
years preceding Deep Thoughts challenge.
Mellon Institute gets new 
name to reflect changing role
Mellon Institute has changed its name to Carnegie Mellon 
Research Institute (CMRI). Institute officials hope that the 
change will better reflect the institutes close relationship with 
the rest of the Carnegie Mellon community.
In our role of applied research and technology transfer, said 
CMRI Director William Kaufman, it is important that industry 
and government recognize the extensive resource that we repre
sent both through our dedicated professional staff of scientists 
and engineers and our access to the research results and consult
ing support of the academic faculty at Carnegie Mellon.
SDC sponsors annual blood

Today and tommorrow, the Student Dormitory Council will be 
holding its yearly blood drive. Located in the Morewood Rec 
Room, the drive will run from noon to 6:30 each day. Winter is a 
rough season for the national blood supplies, as donations drop 
and accidents rise, says SDCs Michael Schwartz.
The process is simple, says Schwartz; it requires a few minutes 
of tests to make sure that you qualify for donation, involving 
completing a few simple forms. In addition, the test involves a 
free cholesterol screen, the results of which will be sent to you in 
two weeks.
Air Force announces five year

Feds arrest D.C. 
Mayor Barry on 
narcotics charges
WASHINGTON (AP)  Mayor 
Marion Barry, embattled by re
peated accusations of drug use, 
faces federal narcotics charges 
today after a sting operation that 
law enforcement sources say 
caught him on videotape smoking 
crack cocaine.
Barry was released on his own 
recognizance by a federal magis
trate, and returned to his home to 
await arraignment at midday. 
City and personal lawyers went 
to his home to consult with him 
overnight.
Barry, who planned to announce 
Sunday his candidacy for a fourth 
term, was arrested last night at a 
downtown hotel. FBI agents and 
local police videotaped him smok
ing cocaine after a friend sold it to 
him, according to a law enforce
ment source who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity.
Authorities had not determined 
whether Barry would face a mis
demeanor or felony charge, 
sources said. The charges would 
depend on the amount of cocaine
or cocaine-base seized when Barry 
was arrested at the Vista Inter
national Hotel, six blocks from 
the White House, sources said.
High Court rules 
tenure records 
subject to review
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
Supreme Court ruled that col

special privilege to withhold con

gally denied tenure.
The Court unanimously re
jected University of Pennsylva
nia arguments that academic 
freedom confers a privilege of 
confidentiality for peer review 
records sought by a faculty mem
ber who sued when denied tenure 
or a lifetime appointment.
The controversy had drawn the 
attention of numerous universi
ties. The University of Pennyslvanias appeal had been sup
ported by Princeton, Brown, Stan
ford, Harvard, and Yale. All told 
the Court that forcing universi
ties to reveal confidential state
ments about professors being
considered for tenure would in
hibit candor by those doing the 
evaluating.
Writing for the Court, Justice 
Harry A. Blackmun said past 
court rulings extending constitu
tional protection for so-called 
academic freedom only applied to 
government attempts to control 
or direct the content of speech 
engaged in by a university.

At night, the cleaning service emp
ties the paper containers. They deposit 
the paper-filled bags at the UCC load

a paper recycling plant.
According to Rosenblum, the pro
gram has been successful. We have 
collected about a quarter ton of paper 
the first week; so far, it seems like 
people are very enthusiastic about it.
Rosenblum gave three reasons for 
the introduction of the pilot program.
According to Rosenblum, an in
creased awareness of environmental 
concerns has fueled a drive towards 
recycling, and the University has fol
lowed that trend.
Rosenblum said that recycling cur
rently is not profitable and that CMU 
does not plan on making money by 
recycling.
Rosenblum also remarked on CMUs 
responsibility to educate its students 
on the environment. Said Rosenblum, 
Recycling is an educational demon
stration of environmental concerns.
Rosenblum added that if the pilot 
program is successful, it could be 
implemented throughout the entire 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
Jeff Rosenblum and Student Gov
ernment President Mark Mittelhauser 
decided to start a comprehensive recy
cling program last year. After estab
lishing faculty contacts with thenOmbudsman Michael Murphy and En
vironmental Health and Safety Direc
tor Peter Collopy, Rosenblum began

Tartan wins national ACP award for excellence
bv dMGK J2 DGM3gMd
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
In recognition for excellence as a weekly 
college newspaper, The Tartan has re
ceived the Associated Collegiate Press 
National Pacemaker Award. This award 
places the Tartan among the top three 
weekly college newspapers in the coun
try, and one of the top nine overall.
The Associated Collegiate Press is a 
non-profit organization of college news
papers and their advisors. What makes 
The Tartan unusual as far as the ACP 
awards are concerned, is that we dont 
have any professional people working on 
the newspaper, said Managing Editor 
Michael Rose, a jvjnior. Its all student 
done.
Weve done an incredible job of build
ing the paper up to what it is today, said 
Editor-in-Chief Howdy Pierce, a junior.
If you go back to the old issues and 
compare what it looked like in 85 or 87 
to what it looks like today, its incredible. 
Weve probably doubled or tripled our 
copy each week, weve gone to full color, 
broadsheet format, our ad revenues are 
up, our staff size is up, and obviously 
from this award, our quality is up.
Rose agrees. Its really made a tre
mendous difference both in how the paper 
looks and how we work on it. A lot of the 
good things that have happened to this 
paper in the past two years, were the 
result of a couple of people deciding some 
years ago that they wanted to change 
things.
Pierce and Rose stressed the contribu
tion of former editor-in-chief, senior Karl 
Barnhart. Karl was really instrumen
tal in making this paper what it is to
day, said Rose. A tremendous amount 
of the credit for this has to go to him, and

Program to help 
inner-city children
Beginning next September, the Role 
Models Program will provide an after 
school program for inner-city children in 
grades one through six. The program 
will be held on campus and will be staffed 
by students from Carnegie Mellon and 
the University of Pittsburgh. These stu
dents will serve as tutors and role mod
els for the children.
The goal of the program, according to 
the Psychology Departments Elaine
Atkinson, who is serving as president of 
the non-profiit group sponsoring the 
program, is to help students to recognize 
the imprortance of scholastic achieve
ment and to raise their aspirations 
through exposure to cultural events and 
to people of diverse backgrounds.

computer science curriculum that will be 
jointly administered by the Mellon Col
lege of Science and the School of Com
puter Science. Students will enter the 
program in their sophomore year, the 
program is designed to prepare students 
for graduate study or carrers in fields 
where computer science and applied 
mathematics are important.

Pierce noted that the increased ad 
revenues do not mean an overshadowing 
of advertising over editorial material. 
Were totally copy-driven, which is 
unusual. Most newspapers are addriven, said Pierce.
He explained that each editor presents 
an amount of copy in a given section for 
a given week. These sections are then 
combined, and the paper is built around 
the available text. Pierce said that pro
fessional newspapers and most college 
newspapers determine the amount of 
editorial material based on the total 
amount of advertising. If they have more 
copy than that a week, well tough, and if 
they dont have enough, then you get 
fluff, he said.

Microsoft is an exciting place to be because youre working for the industry leader in software. In a lot 
of ways, this place is like a college campus. Along with the dedication to work is a spirit of fun and creative 
release. Hey, nobody at Microsoft ever got chastised for wearing the wrong color shirt. You can forget about 
a dress code, and kiss those ties good-bye. The goal here is to perform not conform.
Tom Isenberg, Technical Writer 
Camegie-Mellon Class of 87
As a Technical Writer you will create user-programmer manuals, quick reference 
manuals, and on-line help systems.
You must have demonstrated ability in the use of microcomputers and software, 
and experience with MS-DOS, XENIX, and programming languages (preferably C 
and Pascal languages). A bachelors degree and a practical background in Business,  
Communications, Computer Science, Journalism, or Technical Writing are essential.
Our location in the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle, is one of the most diverse in 
the countryan area where the quality of life is high and exciting. Mountains for 
skiing, hiking, and climbing are close enough for day trips. Three spectacular 
national parks are within easy reach. The beautiful San Juan Islands are yours to 
explore by sailboat or ferry, car or bike. But dont assume that Seattle people spend 
all their time outdoors. This is a young city, with a wealth of cultural and 
recreational opportunities, from live theater, ballet, opera, and symphony to 
football, basketball and baseball.
Microsoft will be interviewing on campus for Technical Writers on

hose not to do them. It was time for 
ome new people to be appointed to these 
0bs and a variety of my colleagues per
suaded me that it was my turn. 
Gibbons original intention was to re
turn to the Stanford faculty to teach and
o research at the end of the Centennial 
Campaign in which he was appointed. 
Gibbons says he was first introduced 
the search process here by a couple of 
trustees who wanted his opinion on 
'arnegie Mellon. He explains that Stan
ford is similar to CMU in that it has gone 
om regional to national prominence in 
he last 40 years; Carnegie Mellon has 
embarked on that course in the last 20. 
When first introduced to the search, 
ribbons interest was primarily in lookng at Carnegie Mellon as an observer, 
jot a candidate. He says his feelings 
hanged as his contact with Carnegie 
Mellon increased. It changed as it could 
expected to change, he says. When 
you see an institution that is dynamic 
,nd warm, and has people who are 
Wanting to do some things, you realize 
hat theres opportunity out there. 
Gibbons says that he is impressed with 
JMU. He feels that the combination of a 
,jgh-quality engineering and science 
chool with a first-class fine arts college 
dynamic, and he called his meetings 
vith CMU students exhilarating.
The search committee did something 
:hat I think is magnificent, he says, 
they prepared a very thoughtful search 
document with inputs from the entire 
:ommunity. As far as I know, that is 
unique in the annals of presidential 
learches. Gibbons thought that CMUs 
Presidential White Paper was very use
ful to anyone who wanted to see just 
what and where CMU was.
Gibbons was among those named in an 
irticle in the January 5 issue of Science 
magazine as possible candidates for the 
iresidency at MIT, which is also con
The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  23 January 1990
imCH,ol TmElRlmAo$ NEIN,o Rt tNAN,o RI mA LAmEtH,l H, gFD
ducting a search. He said that he was 
introduced to MITs search in much the 
same way, but refused to elaborate on 
his status as a candidate there.
The fundamental decision about being 
a president is not one that I have made 
yet, he says. Ive chosen not to do that 
when opportunities have arisen in the 
past. Ive tried to be very clear with the 
various people Ive met with at CMU 
that I havent decided that I want to be 
president.
Gibbons must make that decision be
fore he can go on to discuss any particu
larities of problems and possible solu
tions at any institutions. To devise and 
integrate several aspects of such a plan, 
he says, can only be done if youve al
ready decided that you want to do it. 
Does Gibbons want to be a president? 
Its still before me, he says. I think 
Ive made up my mind. There are certain 
things that I want very much to work on 
that are easy for me to work on at Stan
ford, if the all the conditions can be put 
together correctly. Ive been trying to put 
them together for some time, but I just 
havent had the right group of people to 
work with. It looks like that may have 
changed very recently. If thats the case, 
that will be probably the decisive factor. 
Gibbons is interested in applying video 
education to the problems of elementary 
and secondary education. He says that 
he would like to build a program that 
concentrates on migrant farm workers 
and juvenile delinquents. If it comes 
together, he says, Im staying here. 
Whether or not Gibbons is still a candi
date at CMU remains unclear. He doesnt 
think that he is. I doubt that they would 
consider me to be an active candidate, 
he says, but I dont know.
President Richard Cyert planned his 
retirement for June 30 but has agreed to 
remain at the helm of the university An
drew Carnegie envisioned as a ship. He 
says that he doesnt really know if GibHopkins names Penn State exec as president
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
BALTIMOREThe J ohns Hopkins 
University has named William C. 
Richardson, 49, who had been execu
tive vice president and provost of The 
Pennsylvania State University since
1984, to succeed Steven Muller as presi
dent of Hopkins on July 1.
John Fetkovich, the chair of Carnegie 
Mellons Faculty Presidential Search 
Committee, was surprised to hear of 
Richardsons appointment as president 
of Hopkins. Most of us, I think its fair to 
say, were somewhat surprisedbecause it
was our assumption ... that he was 
next in line for the Penn State [presi
dential] job, which we think is going to 
open up very soon, he said. Since he 
has been there for a longtime, we were 
all assuming that he wanted to stay 
there and take over as president at 
Penn State.
bons remains a candidate. My feelingis, 
probably not,  he says, but people in 
the search might feel differently.
Hes no longer in the singular position 
that he was before, says Faculty Search 
Chair Fetkovich  but he does remain a 
part of the search. No consensus on any 
other lead candidate exists, says Fetkov
ich, because the committees have not yet 
met to discuss such a consensus.
Members of the committee arent 
pleased with the progress of the search. 
I think its slower than all of us had 
hoped for, says Fenves. We at one time 
had hoped that the Steering Committee 
would have something to report for the 
November Board [of Trustees] meeting, 
but that didnt happen.
Indeed, estimates now suggest that it 
will be at least one or two months before 
a short list of candidates is completed.
Despite the lack of a short list, Fetkov
ich does admit that there are currently 
three or four candidatesit depends on 
whocountswho are gettingmaximum 
attention at this point. He says none of 
these candidates, though, are in-house 
candidates.
In addition to these three or four, 
Fetkovich says there are between 12 and 
24 people who the committee wishes to 
pursue further. Out of that group, 
Fetkovich says, we might hope to get 
one, two, or even possibly three addi
tional candidates who look interesting
on the basis of much more extensive 
investigation. That process might take 
one or two months.
In two months, Fetkovich says he hopes 
the committees will have completed their 
considerations and forwarded a short 
list to the Steering Committee, which 
will then make a recommendation to the 
Board of Trustees, who, in turn, will 
make an offer.
Those close to the search dont feel that 
Gibbons wavering or the approach of 
Cyerts planned retirement date will have 
any adverse effects on the search.
Cyert said that he doesnt think that 
the failure to advance any further in the 
discussions with former lead candidate 
Gibbons is significant. The fact that 
there was one favored candidate and 
that it was never was brought to comple
tion is sort of par for the course, he said. 
That happens often in these things.
Nor did he think that Gibbons disin
terest reflected on the University. People 
have different times in their lives when 
they do things, he said. Its a matter of 
finding the right person at the right 
time.
Goldsmith dismissed concerns that the 
committees might settle for a less-thanperfect candidate as June 30 approaches. 
Thats not a drop-dead date, he said. 
There is no way that were going to 
settle for anything less than a person 
who can do the job. There are many
people capable of doing this job. The 
answer is finding one who is available at 
the right time and the right fit.
Fetkovich agrees that the committees 
are under no pressure to expedite their 
search process in order to complete the 
search by Cyerts planned retirement 
date of June 30. President Cyert has 
agreed to stay on for a few extra months 
or however long is necessary, so that we 
dont have to operate in any sort ofpanic 
situation, he said. Fetkovich was skep
tical that any delay would be longer than 
a few months, but he also pointed out 
that Cyert might stay longer if a chosen 
candidate had some impediment to as
suming the office during that time.
While Carnegie Mellon is working to 
complete its short list, Johns Hopkins 
University has already announced that 
Penn States executive vice president 
and provost, William C. Richardson, 
would assume the Hopkins presidency 
on July 1. MIT is still conducting its 
search, and, like Carnegie Mellon, has 
not completed its short list yet.
Fetkovich feels that MITs search has 
some impact on CMUs. It would not be 
surprising to expect that there might be 
some overlap in the lists of people in 
which the two institutions are inter
ested, he said.
Fenves agreed. For obvious reasons, 
the lists intersect to some extent, he 
said.
Crime and incident report: CMU police officer helps keep family in need off street
1/3 AUTO THEFT AND RE
COVERY, 10:23 am. A CMUmployed research scientist rejorted an auto theft in progress 
in the Morewood Gardens park
ing lot. A Campus Police vehicle 
)locked the lower gate and the 
ifficer exited the vehicle to try 
:and find the thieves. He observed 
i brown Mazda pickup backing 
tut of a parking spot with two 
male occupants. As the officer 
ipproached the vehicle it started
to accelerate and headed directly 
for him. As he dodged right, the 
pickup followed him. The officer 
was forced to sidestep the vehicle 
and was missed by less than six 
inches. He immediately radioed 
the information to all responding 
units. As the vehicle proceeded to 
the upper area of the parking lot, 
another Campus Police vehicle 
was arriving at the upper area 
gate. The Mazda burst through 
the gate, nearly striking the
cruiser. The stolen truck jumped 
the curb, drove down the cobble
stone hillside onto Forbes Ave., 
and turned left onto Morewood, 
nearly striking another approach
ing officer, who was on foot. The 
second police vehicle chased the 
truck north on Morewood, and 
the truck accelerated, runningthe 
red lights of Fifth, Bayard, 
Ellsworth, and Center, turning 
left on Center and continuing to 
accelerate. The pickup sped across
the intersections of South Neville 
and Craig Street and was lost 
around Bigelow Blvd. At no time 
were the truck plates read. The 
truck wasfoundlater outside 2159 
Elmore Square with its ignition 
popped. The vehicle was returned 
to its owner. Attempts at finger
prints were negative.
1/3 RECOVERY OF STOLEN 
PROPERTY, 4 pm. While check
ing the Mudge area during the 
holiday break, a housing employee
found a Welcome Homecoming 
banner, supposedly taken from 
the Skibo area during homecom
ing, and reported the stolen prop
erty to the police.
1/11 SUSPICIOUS VE
HICLE, 11:16 pm. A dark-col
ored Ford van was observed trav
eling on Forbes Ave. very slowly. 
The vehicle wandered around the 
campus, ending up in the Morewood Gardens parking lot. The 
car was stopped by Campus Po
lice. It was occupied by a man, 
woman, and child who stated that 
they were looking for a place AH 
park and sleep. They had just 
arrived in Pittsburgh for a doctors 
appointment for the child, and 
apparently were financially un
able to acquire shelter for the 
evening. They were told that they 
would be allowed to park in the 
Morewood Gardens parking lot 
until morning.,However, an HttRQ

5125 Margaret Morrison 
Street, formerly known as 
Tech House and located next 
to Donner Hall, has been de
molished as part of the East 
Campus Construction Proj
ect. The oldest building on 
campus, 5125blocked the con
struction of a proposed walk
way.
The University decided to 
tear down the building as part 
of the project several years 
ago. 5125 was not a func
tional building for the site, 
according to Patrick Keating, 
vice president of University 
Planning.
In 1987 The Tartan re
ported a proposal to move 
5125 in order to prevent its 
destruction. After consider
ing the options, the Univer
sity decided that despite its 
nostalgic value, 5125 wasnot 
worth saving.
Although rich in historic 
value to the University, 5125 
was falling to pieces. If 5125 
were the be saved, the Uni
versity would have had to 
cover not only the costs of 
moving the house, but also 
the costs of renovation.
A lot of discussion in coop
eration with various student 
groups took place, said 
Keating. He said that a fun
draiser had been proposed but 
did not attract enough inter
est from students.
While the residents of Tech 
House, a Catholic special 
interest house, were sad to 
see the house destroyed, they 
understood that it was be
yond saving. I considered 
Tech House to mean the 
people and not the place, said 
Mary Tyler, who lived in the 
old Tech House and now lives 
in the new Tech House on 
Roselawn Terrace.

Controversy surrounds proposed Shadyside historic district
THEARENol t,Hw umeo y
to the Commission. However, this 
type of request can be approved 
by the staff in only a few days, 
rather than the three weeks nec
essary for approval by the full 
Commission.
Pittsburgh City Councilman 
Dan Cohen, who represents Dis
trict 8, is against the formation of 
the district, primarily on the basis 
that many of the residents of the 
area object to it.
To create a district as large as 
this is to create problems if resi
dents dont want it, he said. Many 
of the advocates of the district, 
Cohen said, werent fully aware 
of what they were getting into 
when they signed the petition.
Many people who signed 
thought all that happened was 
they got a bronze plaque on their 
houses. It means much more than 
that, said Cohen.
Another of Cohens concerns 
was that the issue of the 
Shadyside West district brings 
up the question of which areas 
should be granted historic desig
nation. Although Cohen is in favor 
of historic preservation, especially 
of specific sites or buildings, he 
feels that the whole process needs 
to be reassessed.
Nor is Cohen alone in his stand 
against the formation of the dis
trict. An informal committee to 
preserve the rights of property 
owners is being led by Zita 
Glasgow, David Hamburg, John 
Brassert, and Michael West. 
According to Glasgow, over 200 
people are involved in some way 
in opposing the current plan.
Glasgow, an alumna of the 
Carnegie Tech Design Depart
ment, cites the need to distin
guish between what she called 
the concept of preservation in 
the abstract and the actual stat
utes of the city and the manner in 
which the city operates.
Im not against preservation 
 Im against this unfair stat
ute, says Glasgow, who thinks 
that the City is imposing unfair 
costs on the owners of the homes 
in the proposed district.
In Glasgows opinion, the ac
companying burdens of the dis
trict, especially the financial ones, 
are being put upon the shoulders 
of the property owners. For ex
ample, if she wanted to replace 
the windows in her Morewood 
Avenue home, she says that she 
would have to obtain duplicates 
of the original ones, which she 
estimates would cost 40 to 60

percent more than new ones. If 
windows are so important to the 
City of Pittsburgh, then the City 
should pay, she says.
Glasgows fellow committee 
leaders, David Hamburg and John 
Brassert, are also alumni of Car
negie Tech.
Glasgow feels so strongly about 
the creation of the historic dis
trict that she would even consider 
moving if her area is included.
The only way to get a sane 
policy for the City of Pittsburgh is 
to defeat this thing, she adds.
The original boundaries of the 
proposed district called for the 
inclusion of 539 buildings, of
Dustin Frazier/Tartan Contributing Editor
which only 355 are included in 
the revised district boundaries 
approved by the Commission.
Frances Scheuermann, a resi
dent of the area for 36 years, 
supported the original bounda
ries of the district but is not satis
fied with the new ones. Her 
Bayard Street home is one of those 
that was included in the original 
plan but was eliminated when 
the borders were revised.
Scheuermann felt that the for
mation of the district would 
strengthen the neighborhood. The 
area residents have worked to
gether to solve problems before, 
she says, and on the whole she
feels the neighborhood is fairly 
unified.
Historic Review Commission 
Chair Joan Ivey also supported a 
larger district, favoring the plan 
initially created by Shadyside 
residents. She said that the new 
boundaries excluded many cor. 
ners which were included in the 
previous plan.
It is only natural that some 
buildings in and of themselves 
are not historic, but because of 
the district they should be in. 
eluded, she said.
Ivey disputes the claim that the 
new district would be more ex
pensive to property owners is not 
necessarily true. She says five 
other historic districts have been 
created and that increased cost to 
property owners is not the norm,
Although Carnegie Mellon does 
not maintain University housing 
in the Shadyside West area, there 
are Carnegie Mellon students 
residing in non-University buildings along many of the streets 
included in the district.
The district can be created by 
City Council with a majority of 
five votes, but Cohen says its too 
early to tell how the Council will 
see the issue if the district is 
approved by City Planning.

would be moving out the next 
morning. It was that morning that 
police, who had been tracking the 
trio, arrested Mead and Holland 
as they picked up some money 
that had been wired to them.
About a half hour after they 
left that morning, Jones explains, 
they called Keith and decided 
that they would pick him up in 
about an hour. Then a second call 
came a little later, it was [Mead] 
asking for directions to the near
est movie theater.
As Jones began looking up di
rections, suddenly it was no 
longer [Mead] on the phone, he
remembers. It was a police
woman telling me to stay where I 
was, not to move, not to stand up. 
not to go outside, and not to hang 
up the phone,
At this point a concussion gre
nade was shot though the down
stairs window. I felt the house 
exploding, then police came up
stairs and said everything was 
okay It was then that they ar
rested Keith.
Jones recalls, It was very cha
otic. There were about 14 or 15 
police from two communities plus 
the Orange County SWAT team, 
and I had absolutely no idea what 
was happening. I learned a lot of
things from reading the newspa
per later on. I learned an awful lot 
about Keith Goodman that had 
certainly contradicted anything 
that he had told me.
Keith Goodman was not simply 
a 17-year-old that had made a 
mistake and committed armed 
robbery, as Jones had been led to 
believe. Goodman had also raped 
an 84-year-old woman. When he 
wasarrested on J anuary 14, J ones 
found out about the murders.
It was the belief of the police, as 
Jones remembers being told, that 
what the group was doing was 
planning [my] assassination. 
Apparently the other murders
were related to robberies. 
Concerning the arrest, Jones 
said, I never felt threatened  I 
felt imposed upon. I still cant 
believe it. Everything that he had 
ever told me had checked out. I 
didnt have time to feel scared, its 
just that when the arrest was 
made, I felt let down. I am still 
trying to comprehend it all.
Its very frightening to find 
oneself willingly becoming a po
tential victim of someone. Im 
doing a lot of soul-searching. 
Even in hindsight, Jones can
not recognize any indication in 
his friendship with Goodman that 
would tie in with the murders.
He was a very angry person that 
had messed up and lost his own 
life, I know that. When youve got 
no education and no family and 
no skills and no friends and no 
connections  I can just go on 
and on with the nosthe awar - 
ness of all of what he didnt have 
made him a very angry person. 
Jones is currently working on 
transferring the story to paper, a 
method that he feels will help him 
iron out his feelings and come to 
terms with the incident. Ive been 
trying to figure out who I am and 
what all of this has been. It sure 
challenges one to try to figure out 
who he is.

caught the man at the gym. As they con
versed, the man eluded the officers grasp
and ran away towards a hillside behind 
a gas station. The man was climbing the 
hillside with an officer in pursuit when 
he slipped in the snow and tumbled down

The history of Pittsburgh is one 
of taking advantage of the envi
ronment. In the 1890s, steel and 
its pollution built this city and 
helped create Carnegie Mellon.
In the 1990s, two new environ
mentally conscious programs 
show a refreshing attitude in an 
old city.
A pilot program to recycle paper 
waste has just started in Warner 
Hall. Its goal is to make recycling 
a piece of paper as easy as throw
ing the paper into the garbage. 
Initial results, according to Recy
cling Coordinator Jeff Rosenblum, 
a senior, are very encouraging.
Dining Service has stopped us
ing styrofoam at all facilities. 
Certain kinds of styrofoam manu
facturing damage the ozone layer, 
md styrofoam disposal is choking 
Americas landfills. The new paner products mean more expen
sive soft drinks, but theyre well 
vorth the cost.
Both efforts have a price. The 
ise of paper depletes another 
esource  our forests. And sepa
rating trash requires more space 
for garbage cans and more time 
for trash disposal.
The immediate costs, however, 
are minimal. The potential sav
ings may be enormous.
Recycling paper will lower the 
cost of garbage disposal in the 
future. More than half of the trash 
generated by the Universitys of
fices is paper, so paper recycling 
should decrease the need to chop 
down trees for the production of 
tomorrows memos.
Lessening our use of styrofoam 
will also reduce the volume of our 
trash, and it will prevent further 
harm to the ozone layer.
The key to the success of these 
programs will be their simplicity. 
These initiatives, and others such 
as recycling cans, bottles, and 
computer paper in clusters, are 
easy to put into our everyday lives.
Environmental awareness is an 
idea whose time has come. We 
must all step lightly on the Earth 
if not for ourselves, then for our 
successors in the 2090s.

Its the start of a new semester, 
md we thought this would be a 
;ood time to clear up some misonceptions about The Tartans 
orum section.
We find a lot of value in the exhange and even the frequent 
lash of ideas. The Forum pages 
re our way of fostering free 
peech, so we try to provide a 
pectrum of opinions to allow you, 
ur readers, to be the judges. 
Towards that end, youll find 
aree types of written pieces on 
nese pages:
Letters to the editor may be
'ritten by anybody, although 
'hen space gets tight we will favor 
lose from members of the Uniersity community. As readers, 
ou should realize that opinions 
resented in a letter are those of 
ie author and not of The Tartan. 
All letters are subject to editing 
>r size and grammar, but never 
>r content. Of course, we reserve 
le right to reject letters we feel 
re libelous, obscene, or incoherat, but well be glad to discuss 
ny letter with the author and see 
we cant reach a compromise. 
Editorials always appear in the 
iftmost columns of the first Folm page. They are unsigned 
scause they represent a consenT opinion of The Tartans edito
rial board.
While we believe our editorials 
offer sensible, accurate commen
tary, please feel free to disagree 
with uswe dont have a monop

Columns are regularly appear
ing opinions presented by indi
viduals who are usually members 
of the University community. 
Opinions in columns are those of 
the columnists and not of The 
Tartan. Again, feel free to dis
agree with them.
Each semester, we recruit col
umnists for our Forum section. 
The only job requirements are that 
columnists have an opinion on 
something each week and that 
they present their arguments in a 
well-structured manner.
That about sums up our Forum 
section, except that wed like to 
announce a new feature. Every 
month, well be soliciting opinions 
from the campus community on 
specific topics and bundling these 
opinions on a page called Open 
Forum.
Submissions for the first Open 
Forum, which will focus on the 
role of higher education in the 
future, are due February 2. Look 
for Open Forum on February 6  
it should make for some thoughtprovoking reading.

Editor's note  The following letter 
was submitted to The Tartan prior to 
our last issue in December. Because of 
an inadvertent editing error, the content 
of the letter which appeared in print was 
significantly different than the content 
of the original letter. We apologize for the 
mistake.
Editor:
We would like to 
clarify what was re

sue of The Tartan 
concerning the SDC
LETTER TO 
THE EDITOR
Saturday night films. On Wednesday 
November 15, prior to the Tartan ar
ticle, Bonnie Gorman and Anne Witchner of Student Affairs, Adam Goldsmith 
and Rob Bethge of Activities Board, and 
Bryan Wong of SDC met to discuss the 
recent vandalism that occurred after 
showing a film in DH 2210. That eve
ning, during the general meeting of the 
SDC concerns over alcohol, vandalism, 
and overcrowding were discussed.
As a result of both meetings, several 
suggestions were made:
to have a stricter regulation of the 
number of tickets sold
to start an awareness program using 
flyers and posters to inform students 
about their behavior during films 
to suggest that security assist the 
ticket takers to monitor students enter
ing and leaving films
to have AB and SDC cooperate in 
handling this matter to enhance the 
benefit for students 
These suggestions were acted upon 
immediately by SDC and AB. That week
end, the following policy was instituted: 
the number of people to be admitted to 
a film was limited to 270, the maximum 
seating capacity in DH 2210 
the ticket takers were instructed to 
call security immediately if any problems 
occurred
security was sent a schedule of the 
films and was requested to monitor the 
flow of students entering and leaving 
films
We are writing this letter because we 
want students to understand that SDC is 
concerned with any problems that occur 
with the films shown in DH 2210. Overcrowding has become a major concern of 
SDC and was dealt with accordingly.
However, during the last issue of The 
Tartan, the reporter inaccurately wrote 
that a student commenting on the films 
policy was a member of SDC. In fact, the 
only member of SDC that was approached 
for any comments was our films chair
person. No other SDC representative was 
asked to comment on the issue despite 
our lengthy discussion on the previous 
Wednesday. Also, none of the partici
pants of the original meeting were ap
proached for any comment.
Currently SDC tries to. inform campus 
organizations, such as The Tartan of the 
discussion that occur during general 
meetings by distributing the SDC min
utes.
We urge The Tartan to be equally as 
concerned with getting these facts re* 
ported as accurately as possible.

Campus Police needs to upgrade its standards

Today I was the

There is a wideO
LETTER TO 
THE EDITOR
spread belief on campus, held equally 
by students and administration, that 
students prefer to sleep in. Courses 
scheduled at 8 am are few and on occa
sion, when they become the subject of 
loud student protest, they are moved 
ahead to a more godly hour: 9:30 or 11. 
At the School of Urban and Public Af
fairs, where I am a graduate student, 
the same is true.
Perhaps I am one of the small minor
ity of morning people in this campus 
community. And perhaps my complaint 
will not be heard. Today at 7:15 am on 
a Saturday morning, the shuttle bus 
driver in a whirlwind first swing through 
Oakland and Shadyside, eager to get 
back to school for a cup of coffee, I assume, passed me by. At 7:15 he was 
supposed to be on Center at the Tudor/ 
Carol apartments. I was still one block or 
1/2 minute from my stop at Negley and 
Walnut when I saw the bus zoom by  
leaving me two options: to walk to cam
pus (1 mile) or to walk home to wait 
another half hour.
Taking streets parallel to Fifth to avoid 
rain splatter from the heavier traffic there, 
I walked briskly  mildly enjoying the 
exercise and not worrying about early 
morning criminals. Yet I was alert and 
suddenly I sensed something was about 
to happen. Something did happen. A car 
turned around at the intersection I was 
walking across, then pulled to the side of 
the road one and a half blocks ahead of 
me. No one emerged. My suspicions were 
growing, sol walked to the other side and 
memorized the license number just in 
case. The door opened and he swung his 
body around to show me that he was 
jerking off. I was lucky. Others may not
be as lucky.
Open lewdness is a crime. But the fail
ure of Campus Police to protect the com
munity by enforcing adherence to the 
bus schedule during early morning 
(weekend) hours is also a crime. Although 
they said the driverwill be reprimanded, 
I really wonder to what extent they will 
be willing to enforce adherence to the 
schedule.
I urge the Police Department at CMU 
to live up to its standards. The shuttle 
bus exists for safety purposes. Safety in 
the early morning is just as important as 
safety at night. If the schedule had been 
adhered to, perhaps I would not have 
been the victim of a crime.
And please let this be a reminder to 
those who walk to campus alone to take 
the major roads... no matter how attrac
tive a short cut and quiet roads may be.

To the Powers 
that Be:
Why are you LETTER TO 
taking away our EDITOR
parking?
Last semester, you took away parking 
privileges from the comer of Margaret 
Morrison Avenue to the first streetlight.
I saw that trucks driving to and from the 
construction site needed the space, al
though I didnt understand why night
time parking was prohibited.
Now there is no parking all the way to 
the roads bend. Margaret Morrison 
Avenue has never had problems with 
congestion, so why clear students cars 
from the curbside? Does Campus Secu
rity need more revenue? Are you trying 
to build demand for the new garage? 
Why are you taking away our parking 
privileges?
And more importantly, can we have 
them back?

Over the past several months, we have 
witnessed an extremely remarkable 
move towards freedom and democracy. 
Yet in spite of all the exhilarating suc
cess of the freedom and democracy 
movements in Eastern Europe, we 
should not forget the people of China.
On June 3,1989, the Chinese govern
ment cracked down and brutally crushed 
the movement for freedom and democ
racy in China, leaving behind a trail of 
death and broken spirits. Tiananmen
Square, the site where thousands of stu
dents, intellectuals and workers con
verged, became abloodbath in mere hours. 
Troops from the Peoples Army encircled 
the square and began their spree of beat
ing, followed by sporadic and indiscrimi
nate shooting at defenseless students.
Thousands of innocent people demand
ing liberty, economic and political free
dom, and an end to governmental corrup
tion were gunned down. Even the make
shift hospitals set up in Tiananmen 
Square used to treat the hunger strikers 
were destroyed under the treads of tanks. 
It has been said that at the time of the 
crackdown, there were still hunger strik
ers in the medical tents.
Once the crackdown was accomplished, 
the government began a hunt of sup
posed collaborators and criminals 
responsibleforthedemocraticmovement. 
Those individuals who were captured 
were then forcibly brought to an unjust 
trial and executed. These actions, as well 
as the bravery of the students who de
manded liberty, should not be forgotten.
The Chinese students, although ask
ing for immense changes and reforms in 
their government, were not making il
logical demands. Democracy and t,oo&
dom are extremely important for all 
people, and the Chinese are no excep
tion. Yet there were other demands mI

I have been inundated with 
queries lately from former Iron 
Curtain countries asking what 
they can expect now that they 
/have thrown off the yoke of com
munism.
Here are some examples:
Question: If we become a de
mocracy, does that mean we will 
no longer have corruption among 
'ur politicians?
Answer: That is correct. Democ
racies have a strict rule banning 
dishonesty in government. If a 
public servant does anything to 
break his oath, he is dealt with 
even more severely than if he lived 
jn a totalitarian country  un
less he has a good lawyer and can 
plea-bargain his way out.
Question: If the nouveaux lib
erated adopt democratic forms of 
government, does that mean we 
have to listen to all the speeches 
of the various political parties?
Answer: Citizens must pay a 
price for freedom of speech, and
that price means they must hear 
out all the candidates. Besides 
doing that, free people are also 
expected to contribute money to 
political campaigns, sotheirrights 
will be guaranteed.
Question: I have a friend who 
says that since we have toppled 
the communist power in East 
Germany, we will not be permit
ted to leave home without our 
American Express cards. True or 
false?
Answer: Your friend is right, 
but it doesnt necessarily have to 
be American Express  you can 
carry a Visa, Mastercard, or even 
a Diners Club card. This must be 
produced on demand when you 
walk into a shopping mall. The 
credit card is to the West what a 
Havana cigar is to Fidel Castro.
Question: Bulgaria, wherellive, 
is for all intents and purposes a 
free nation. I do not have much 
money to spend. What is the first 
thing you would advise someone 
to buy who has just been liber
ated?
Answer: A radar detector. If you 
are going to beat the highway
patrol at their own game in a 
democratic society, it is essential 
that you have a radar detector 
clipped to your sun visor. The 
most important thing for all citi
zens is to evade speed traps.
Question: An East German fa
ther writes, Under democracy, 
will I have discipline problems 
with my children?
Answer: Only if they stay home. 
Most children in democratic coun
tries disappear as soon as they 
are old enough to drive. They are 
not seen again until they have a 
financial problem which can solely 
be resolved by their parents.
Question: Under the harsh 
Romanian regime of Ceausescu, I 
failed to return a library book in 
Bucharest because of the curfew. 
Before I knew it, I owed $87 in 
fines. Am I still responsible for 
this amount now that Ceausescu 
has been shot?
Answer: People are responsible 
for overdue library books no 
matter who is in power. The only 
way to get out of paying is to go to 
the nearest Vatican embassy and 
ask for asylum.

A stranger wandered into 
town last week, riding a blast of 
cold air and winter storm. He 
arrived, set up camp, and 
headed fraternity way. No one 
knew who he was  he looked 
vaguely familiar, and they say 
he play ed a mean game of Tet
ris.
I knew the stranger; I once 
knew him like the back of my 
hand; I could predict, control, 
tabulate his various actions, and 
make sense of him.
The last time we met he was 
headed home, after doing dirty 
deeds cheap in dangerous 
places. He was going to rest 
then, looking forward to a place 
where you could sleep when you 
wanted, and where the food 
wasnt measured by halflives.
They were expecting him 
there, and were prepared for 
him  he had not seen home in 
too long, and he was a different 
person then, before the changes.
When I finally tracked him 
down, late one night in a smoky, 
ill-lit corner ofThe Yard, he had 
strange story to tell. Hed been 
hittingthe blender drinks pretty 
heavily all nighthe was pretty
jittery from the sugar, and I was 
worried. His face was haggard, 
but he seemed at peace somehow, 
like he belonged.
Home aint home no more.
I was surprised  I know that 
he really didnt love his home
town, but I knew that he had a 
good family there, a family that 
supported and cared for him. And, 
after all, home was home, right?
What do you mean? I asked, 
sweeping empty fudgesicle 
glasses out of the way. I thought 
you loved your family.
I do, he said, killing the latest 
virgin daiquiri, but I dont love 
home. Familys same as ever. 
Problem is, so is the town. 
What do you expect? Youve 
been away, doing things they can 
only dream about. Youre a differ
ent person, with different experi
ences. Besides, according to you, 
you never really fit in, anyway; 
you had different value systems, 
different expectations about 
people.
Nail on thehead,he answered 
with an angry flash of green eyes. 
Ive always been different in very 
basic ways  my value systems, 
my expectations, things that 
motivate me. Thing is, I got out, 
and made sure that I lived the 
hell out of wherever I was, made 
sure that I made the most of the 
situation. I made mistakes, but
through it all I learned, and 
changed, grew beyond the defi
nitions that my history there 
imposed on me. But I wentback 
and found that others, others 
who had gone, hadnt changed, 
that others hadnt made the 
most of their situations. And, 
the people still there, the ones 
I knew, are still trapped in the 
terrible suspension of the place. 
I really couldnt communicate 
with them.
I didnt know what to say. 
So, what are you going to do?
Im not going back home. My 
lifeishere, my friendsarehere, 
my future is here  Im here. 
Home is there, where the oth
ers are still trapped. There is 
no reason to go home  I can 
take care of myself  I prefer 
to.
You dont sound too sad 
about all this.
Flash of a smile, a warm life 
behind the eyes. Thats the 
great thing  Im not sad. Im 
home.
I left him there, as he bur
rowed deeper into the blender. 
I felt pretty safe about it  the 
stranger may have had prob
lems before, but hes fine now.
After all, he is home.

Question: In the days before 
the overthrow of the hated 
Honecker regime, I burned the 
American flag and everyone ap
plauded. Now they tell me that 
this is forbidden because we have 
a democratic government. What 
gives?
Answer: In a totalitarian state 
American-flag burning is encour
aged. But you cant have people 
going around doing that in a free 
country because it would encour
age everybody to take the law 
into their own hands.
Question: We are expecting to 
hold elections in Bulgaria. How 
do we find a vice president as 
qualified as Dan Quayle?
Answer: Nobody can get that 
lucky.
Question: If Poland elects a 
new president, will Johnny Car
son make fun of us, the way he 
does of President Bush?
Answer: Only if they print his 
cue cards in Polish.

well. For example, Chinese stu
dents wanted the ability to deter
mine what type of work they 
wanted to pursue. In many in
stances, students who wanted to 
become scientists, philosophers, 
economists, and teachers were 
forced to work in factories to sup
port the state.
But in Eastern Europe, the 
people of East Germany, Czecho
slovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, 
Poland, and even the ultra-Stalinist-Leninist nation of Ruma
nia, were able to shed the trap
pings of what has been proven to 
be an ineffective, oppressive, and 
stagnant system: Communism. 
The people are being heard, not 
quelled, as was the case in China.
In Rumania, the despotic gov
ernment of the now deceased 
Nikolai Ceausescu, was justly re
moved after years of brutal cor
ruption, tyranny and murder. The 
next despotic government that 
should step down is that of China.
Let us not forget the students of 
China who gave their lives in 
Tiananmen Square for freedom 
and democracy.

A committee formed by Stu
dent Affairs recently recom
mended that a certain CMU 
student it thinks has an atti
tude offensive to the University 
as a whole, be required to 
become involved in various 
programs of diversity offered by 
the Division of Student Affairs.
I applaud the committee for 
this excellent idea. Even though 
the student in question has not 
broken any university rule, he 
should be required to take the 
course and be re-educated. Its 
not without precedent  both 
Hitler and Stalin re-educated 
many members of their socie
ties  if every student who 
doesnt agree with the beliefsof 
the current administration is 
re-educated, we will soon have 
a pleasant strife-free campus.
Apparently the administra
tion believes that diversity is 
not a state of being unlike 
[Websters], but rather instead 
a state of being in agreement 
with the official attitude [Dic
tionary of CMU administrator 
doublespeak]. The student 
made the mistake of actually 
believing the idea that because 
he is at a university, he has the 
right to free speech.
Au contraire, mes amis. You 
have freedom of speech only as 
long as the Division of Student 
Affairs decides you are not har
assing someone. In this con
text, harassing, apparently 
means not agreeing with the 
administration and student 
governments currentDiversity 
campaign.
To find out who needs to be 
more diverse, we could insti
tute a system of Diversity 
Points. You would get plus or 
minus points depending on your 
activities. For example, going 
to a senate sponsored cultural 
event would give you plus five. 
Going to a fraternity party, 
minus five. This program could 
be expanded, with the use of a
computer system, to include the 
food purchased in University 
dining. Vegetables and other 
culture food, plus. Meat and 
potatoes, minus. Same thing 
with the books and magazines 
bought from the bookstore. 
Women authors, minority writ
ers, cultural magazines, plus. 
White male writers, Sports Il
lustrated, minus.
This is probably not enough 
to get a true picture of the di
versity of the individual stu
dent. We also need to keep track 
of what they say in class and 
who their friends are. Profes
sors couldhave a chart to fill in 
at the end of each class, label
ing potential un-Diverse stu
dents and adding or subtract
ing points. For example, some
one who spoke out in a history 
or English class against the 
current womens movement, or 
who said that affirmative ac
tion is wrong would get minus 
points. The students who ar
gued with them would get 
positive points.
The University could hire 
students to observe those 
around them; plus points for 
talking to members of the op
posite sex or other cultures or 
races or sexual orientation; 
minus for talking to un-Diverse 
people.
The student with the most 
Diversity points at the end of 
the semester would automati
cally become student governmentpresident. The top twenty 
would become student sena
tors. Students below the Aver
age Diversity Point Level would 
have to stay at CMU over the 
next vacation and take the Di
versity Re-Education camp. 
They could even get a Diver
sity t-shirt to wear the rest of 
the year. Keep this up for a few 
years and we will have a per
fectly Diverse campus, every
one wearing their identical tshirts and being Diverse to
gether.

December 1989: The reflections of a vacationing couch potata
/meIHoIe bEc4
I think Im in a sort of good 
news/bad news situation. The 
good news is that I think I found 
my true calling in life over vaca
tion. The bad news is that Im not 
sure I can get anyone to pay me 
for getting up at the crack of noon,
; playing video games all day, and 
; watching reruns ofKate andAllie 
and The Mary Tyler Moore Show
on obscure UHF channels until 4 
am. Not without running for 
Congress, anyway.
Actually, I did spend some time 
doing other things. Knowing that 
I had a column to write when I got 
back to school and that so many 
people depend on me for insight
ful analysis of the news, I devoted 
considerable time to mulling over 
the events of the last month. Of 
course I needed something to 
think about during all those True 
Confessions commercials.
Here are the results of my con
templations.
Using the same system as the 
Baseball Hall of Fame where a 
person can be elected after being 
retired for five years, 1994 is going 
to be a big year for the Scum and 
Losers Hall of Fame. The obvious 
nominees for 1989 include Jim 
Wright, Manuel Noriega, Ayatol
lah Khomeini, Dexter Manley, 
Pete Rose (who may be elected to 
both Halls), Ben Woods, Charles 
Keating, and most of the Eastern 
European communist leaders.
I dont know if Ronald Reagan
will be elected, but he should at 
least get an honorable mention 
for malicious incompetence.
 I wonder if Washington D.C. 
Mayor Marion Barry bought his 
crack in front of the White House.
 At the time I am writing this 
column, the point spread for the 
Super Bowl is listed at 12 points. 
I understand that a point spread 
is a way of showing that the 49ers 
are heavy favorites, but why in 
the world would someone want to 
bet that a team is going to act 
against its own self interest by
trying to cover the spread?
Assume that San Francisco is 
winning by nine points with 30 
seconds left in the game. Anybody 
who bets that they are going to try 
to kick a field goal should be locked 
up for his or her own safety.
 Why are foreign students will
ing to be slaughtered in the streets 
of Beijing and Timisoara for de
mocracy while students in this 
country wont even cross the street 
to vote? Im sure desperation has 
something to do with it, but that 
doesnt explain why students are
affected more than the rest of the 
population. Students have been 
the leaders of protest movements 
in China, Eastern Europe, and 
even the United States during 
the civil rights movement and Vietnam War. Yet our generation of 
students in the United States 
seems less involved in political 
activism on every level than any 
other part of the population.

If theres one person I could 
thank for something really im, portant he or she has given me, I 
, know just who it is.
It is not my parents for bring
ing me into this world.
It is not my friends Karen, Lisa, 
or Traci for giving me friendships 
that have survived the test of time 
and then some.
And no, it is not the Coca-Cola 
Company for giving me a $20,000 
scholarship to attend the college 
of my choice.
The one person I really want to 
thank is Billy Joel.
Yeah, I am thanking a singer I 
have never met before and whose 
concerts I have yet to attend.
This man is my idol. He has 
opened my eyes to the world and
a lot of things I was too busy to 
care about since they did not di
rectly involve me. He made me 
realize that I missed a hell of a lot 
of good stuff while it was still 
happening. And now that I see 
how many things I have not paid 
attention to, I am completely un
able to ignore it in the future.
In addition to producing some 
incredibly great mellow-me-out 
music for well over a decade, Billy 
Joel has also given me a gift no 
one else has ever given to me, not 
even my favorite teachers. He has 
given me the gift of a real history 
education, one that I desperately 
needed.
You see, I have never been one 
to pay attention to politics that 
much, trying to figure out who 
was good and who was bad. Its 
not that I didnt want to know, its 
just that I did not have the pa
tience to sit down and read the 
news section of the paper in the
morning. I was always too busy 
pouring over a Garfield comic strip 
or trying to understand what my 
horoscope meant, and if it would 
possibly come true.
Well, now those days are over. 
Ive given up on the fat cat ever 
trying to stick to his diet, and the 
stars just dont have anything in 
them for me. I can now be seen 
reading the news section of every 
paper that comes into my sight, 
because I finally realize just how 
important the news really is.
The first time I heard Billy 
Joels new album, Storm Front, I 
thought it had some of the great
est music on it. After listening to 
it a few times, a friend gave me a 
copy of the lyrics so I would be 
able to follow the words. When I 
first read the words to We Didnt 
Start the Fire, I was completely 
mesmerized by all the historical 
events mentioned, including ones 
whose significance I did not even

Men at CMU are conditioned to 
feel sorry for themselves. The in
famous male/female ratio, still 
somewhere below 3:2, can be an 
object of ridicule, depression, or 
despair. The hope of better days 
beyond graduation is always in 
the back of our minds.
According to the New York 
Times, those better days do not 
exist until we turn 40. According 
to Census Bureau figures, single 
men in their 20s outnumber single 
women of the same age by 22 
percent.
The same patterns that occur 
in school occur in the real world: 
older men date and often marry 
younger women. A 1985 survey 
by the National Center for Health 
Statistics found that the average 
groom is 5.3 years older than his
bride. Its kind of like seniors 
poaching on the freshmen as soon 
as they arrive on campus.
Despite the numbers, women 
still complain. I think theres a 
shortage of men, said Risa 
Zaitschek, a 24-year old Manhat
tan graphic designer to the Times. 
Yet Zaitschek has a boyfriend.
Complaints from me may sound 
like sour grapes, but after five 
years of CMU, I figure that things 
should get easier away from 
Oakland.
I dont want to meet women like 
University of North Carolina sen
ior Martha Catherine Dagenhart 
who wants to meet a sophisti
cated 26- or 27-year old after 
graduation, or 23-year old Bon
nie Zweiback who claims, Most of 
the guys my own age Ive dated 
dont have a clue.
How will we men cope? The same 
as we always have, with lies and 
denials, those things psychologists 
call defense mechanisms. One

totally understand.
Needless to say, the song 
kindled a spark into my lifeone 
that was too strong to be blown 
out by mere ignorance. No longer 
would I say that global affairs 
have nothing to do with me, be
cause they most certainly do. 
Without the events of the last 
hundred years, the world would 
not be what it is today. The United 
States would not be what it is 
today. Come to think of it, I would 
not be what I am today. I like the
way I am, and cant imagine being 
anything else.
I am the way I am today be
cause of the ERA. And because of 
House bills thataffected thehandicapped. And because of scientists 
and doctors who dedicated their 
lives to research. And because of 
Presidents whose ideals did not 
always agree with mine. And 
because of the horror the Jews 
went through in the Holocaust. 
And because of all the people out 
there who do not believe in the
same things I do. These have a]] 
shaped the person that I am to, 
day, and I am very grateful to my 
history for who I turned out to be.
But I am more grateful to Billy 
Joel for pointing it out to me. All, 
those years went by, and I never 
even realized it. But I am happy 
to say that I have caught up with 
it now, and wont let go of it until 
the flame dies out.

to lower your standards, he 
claims. In reality, hes waiting 
until hes 30 to find some 22-year 
old.
In the meantime, prospects for 
the single male look gloomier than 
ever. The singles bars and health 
clubs are becoming as lonely as 
monasteries. Male bonding is on 
the rise, and were powerless to 
stop it, at least until the birth 
rate changes.
Maybe we should continue to 
use our fake IDs beyond our 21st 
birthdays. If we can fool women 
into thinking were 28 instead of 
23, we may yet stop poaching 
from our elders. Otherwise, its 
bachelor pads for all of us.

Tartans have ups and downs over break
Young mens team boosts 
isdeIisxNw record with second win
by Josh Ruben
-The most unstable, unpredictprecarious job in the world 
nothing to do with rocket 
steel mills, coal mines, 
offices.
The most tiresome, trying, 
fand all-around pain-in-the-butt) in this country is being a 
football coach in either the 
'college or professional ranks.
If you are thinking about 
| going into the exciting world of 
(Football Planning and CoordiIhating (i.e., coaching), think 
again.
Why should you listen to me? 
[Well, even though I never have 
played, let alone coached the 
I game of football, I do have at 
i least one excellent source of information who gave me the lowlovm on what the coaching biz ; 
vis all about. >
L Foge Fazio played for the Pitt! 
[Panthers and went on to a fine 
jrofessional career as a tight 
fed with the Green Bay Pack
ers. When his playing career 
[fended, he went into coaching.
|1was head coach at Pitt for 
four years. Football coaches 
spend a lot in moving costs.
was watching Georgia play 
Syracuse in the Peach Bowl 
nth Foge, and he would predict 
fxactly what would happen on 
ich play. Any bozo can say 
/ether or not the quarterback 
|jsgoing to pass and be right 
ifist of the time.
Jut Foge would tell me the 
subtle components of the game 
piat are ignored by most socalled experts.
After the game I saw him get 
stopped by several college footrball dignitaries who wanted to 
bhake hands and say hello.
 The head coach at Syracuse 
i asked for Foges phone number,
I so that in the future, he could 
 offer Foge a job or maybe even 
-ask for one.
Foge lost his latest job as an 
Atlanta Falcons assistant a 
 couple of weeks ago when Jerry 
ij Glanville was named the new -* 
f Falcons head coach.Football 
poaches are hired to be fired. A 
teach that can hold onto his job 
for two or even three years is 
[ucky.
fcjPhg same group of men hold 
most of the coaching jobs in the 
country. At the end of every sea
son, a handful of coaches will 
get fired. But a coach will soon 
find a job from one of the other 
teams that fired their coach at 
the same time he got fired. Its a 
weird, yet consistent cycle.
Not even coaching legends are 
immune from the system. Tom 
Landry, the man who built the 
Dallas Cowboys into Americas 
Team, got canned.
Coaches are an elite group 
who have formed their own 
little cliques. Foge lost his 
Falcons job because Glanville 
will bring in his own coaching 
staff.
Assistant coaches jobs are 
dependent upon the work of the 
head coach, not necessarily 
their own work.
When I last heard from him, 
Foge had been offered the head 
coaching job at Rutgers. But in 
the tail end of the 1989 college 
and pro seasons, plenty of posi
tions opened up. Whether or not; 
he will be willing to subject 
himself to the press, fans, and 
alumni pressures again is 
anyones guess.
One has to wonder why Foge 
and the rest of them stay in the 
business when all they have to 
look forward to is pressure, 
heartache, and disappointment.
I think the answer is obvious: 
the love of the game.

Midway through the 1989-90 
season, the mens basketball team 
is playing like the young team 
that it is. Disappointing turnovers 
and spectacular steals occur backto-back and the team has 
struggled against many of its 
opponents this year.
An 80-73 overtime win over the 
University of Chicago gave the 
team only its second win of the 
season and raised its record, half
way through the year, to 2-11.
The Tartans now only have two 
upperclassmen on the squad. 
Junior Lewis Jackson, freshman 
Kenyatte Mason, and senior Keith 
Morgan all left the team during 
winter break, leaving Head Coach 
Anderson to rely on seniors Chris 
Cheese Luckett and Harvey 
Beckham to provide leadership.
Were young and inexperi
enced, said Anderson. Were not 
strong.
Luckett has responded to the 
call dramatically. The 67 senior 
leads the team in scoring with 
over 19 points per game and has 
scored 30 points three times this
Cheese can be one of the tough
est Division III centers around; 
he can score! said Anderson.
Beckham has moved into the 
starting lineup and has found his 
groove since some early rough 
times. His 14 points and eight 
rebounds against Chicago were 
instrumental in Carnegie 
Mellons first University Athletic 
Association win in 10 tries.
The Tartans played their best 
basketball of the year in the first 
15 minutes of the first half against 
the Maroons. A twelve point run, 
capped by three-point bombs by 
Beckham and freshman Todd 
Jenkins, gave CMU a 28-17 lead.
Chicago, however, roared back. 
The Maroons came back to take a 
39-38 halftime lead with their 
own three-point specialists, 
James Homing and Matt Krapf.
Both teams dug in during the 
second half. Chicago managed to 
move ahead by five midway 
through the half, but Jenkins 
three-point shooting and 
Lucketts inside play put the 
Tartans back on top by one with 
less than three minutes to go.
Chicagos Mark Phelan tied the 
game at the 2:20 mark when he 
made one of two free throws, but

was answered with a Charlie 
Connors tip-in with one minute 
remaining. James Holcomb knot
ted the score at 69 with a jumper 
with 34 seconds to go. The Tar
tans, though, were not able to win 
in regulation. As time ran out, 
Beckham missed an off-balanced
15-footer, sending the game into 
overtime.
The Tartans took the early lead 
in overtime when Connors sank a 
pair of free throws, and extended 
the lead to four with another 
Luckett basket. Chicago could 
never get closer than two. Chris
Dobbs hit a free throw to give 
CMU a three point lead with less 
than a minute to go and Bronner 
added two more seconds later to 
clinch the win. Jenkins closed the 
scoring with a lay-up.

The Tartans slipped further in 
the University Athletic Associa
tion standings this week as they 
lost a pair of conference games on 
their home court. The latest set
back came Saturday night when 
the CMU women lost 69-60 to the 
University of Chicago. The loss 
gave the Tartans a 9-6 overall 
mark, as well as a 7-4 UAA rec
ord.
The Tartans came out playing 
strong defense, but a pair of threepointers by the Maroons put CMU 
in an early hole. The teams battled 
back and forth for a few minutes 
before the Maroons went on a 10- 
point run, assisted by Tartan 
turnovers. By the time the Tar
tans got back on the scoreboard, 
they trailed by 14 points with 
only 5:46 left in the first half.
Unfortunately for the Tartans, 
things got worse before they got 
better, and the Maroons extended 
theirleadto20 with time running 
out. Senior co-captain Lisa Smith 
hit a basket with 14 seconds 
remaining, but the Tartans went 
to halftime trailing 41-23. We 
seemed to be a little out of sync, 
explained head coach Gerri Seidl, 
who watched her team commit 16 
turnovers in the first half.

The Tartan game plan received 
an overhaul at the break as coach 
Seidl switched to an offense using 
four guards and only one forward. 
The new game plan had immedi
ate effect. The Tartans cut five 
points off of the Maroon lead, 
forcing a timeout. Over the next 
ten minutes, the Tartans played 
a much better defensive game, 
but still found themselves trail
ing by 16 with just over seven 
minutes left.
Less than a minute later, sen
ior co-captain Donna Spicuzza hit 
a basket and a pair of free throws 
to key a Tartan rally that pushed 
the score to 61-52 with four min
utes left. Unfortunately, the Tar
tans couldnt get any closer as the 
Maroons perfect foul shooting, 
offset Smith, who scored 7 of her 
game-high 22 points in the last 
three minutes.
Thursday, the Tartans ran up 
against the Bears of Washington
University, who were undefeated 
in UAA play. The Tartans found 
themselves at themercy of the 
Bears forwards, who combined 
for 50 points in the 72-64 Tartan 
defeat. Although the Tartans lim
ited Washington to 49 shots, the 
key to the game was accuracy as 
Washingtons shooting percent
age for the game stood at an 
amazing .653 mark.
The Tartans started slowly, 
allowing the Bears to build a 10-4 
lead in the first five minutes, but 
senior Tricia Chorgo played a 
major role in keeping the Tartans 
in the game with six points and a 
strong rebounding game. Chorgo, 
who pulled down a game-high 13 
rebounds, had 10 in the first half 
to keep the Tartans close.
The teams battled back and 
forth for the remainder of the first 
half with neither team gaining an 
advantage. The two teams played

Swim teams smash records in Hiram

By KELLY STERLING

It was a day of records for the 
women and an easy win for the 
men as Carnegie Mellons swim 
teams handily defeated Hiram 
College Saturday afternoon.
The women defeated their op
ponents by a score of 64 to 41. 
Two records were broken by the 
LadyTartans. First, senior Franc
esca Cranell, sophomore Glynnis 
Frost, and freshman Leslie Dut
ton broke the school and pool 
records forthe 400 free relay. Also, 
sophomore Jo Wollschlaeger 
broke the school record for the 
backstroke.
It was a good meet all around, 
said Wollschlaeger. We worked 
hard in practice and tried our 
best.
The men also won by a good 
margin, 7827. Because of

Hirams limited roster of only 
seven, the meet was only a sprint 
meet whi'ch is shorter than a 
regular meet. In addition, some of 
the Tartans were also able to 
compete in events in which they 
normally dont participate.
We worked well as a team, 
said sophomore Brian Zimmer
man. Unfortunately, they 
[Hiram] dont have much of a 
swim program.
This was the first meet for the
Tartans since their trip to Flor
ida. The teams drove to Florida to 
train for 12 days, giving them an 
opportunity to utilize the supe
rior facilities offered there. If last 
weeks meet is any indication, the 
trip was indeed a success for the 
team.
The Tartans next meet is at 
home against Bethany College on 
Saturday at 1 pm. Next Tuesday, 
the Tartans then travel to Slip

Mother Nature wasnt very 
kind to the Carnegie Mellon ski 
team this weekend. In its first 
race as a team, frozen rain 
pelted the National Collegiate 
Ski Association (NCSA) course 
at Tussey Mountain, making 
Saturdays races unpleasant 
and forcing CMU to pull out of 
Sundays competition.
Saturday, the Carnegie Mel
lon men placed 11 out of 12, 
coming in ahead of Duquesne.
In the first slalom, junior Mike 
Barmada, team captain, had a 
time of 52.89. He was followed 
by sophomore Tom Clanguswith 
114.26 and freshman Coates 
Carter who finished with a time 
of 117.46. Senior Dan Hushan 
didnt finish the course. The rain 
continued into the second race 
which only Barmada finished.
He had a time of 51.53 seconds 
which gave him the number 24 
spot out of the 70 skiers that 
competed on Saturday.
In overall team standings the 
women placed last, but were 
only 7 seconds from the 10th 
place team from Pitt. Bucknell 
and Penn State were numbers 
one and two. Individually, the 
team did well. In the first race 
sophomore Wendy Geberth fin
ished with a time of 72.78, 
closely followed by senior Karyn 
Silva with a time of 72.83.
Junior Jamie Christner had a 
time of 128.88. Sophomore 
Adele Banning finished the 
course in 75.2 seconds but was 
disqualified. In the second race 
Geberth finished with a time of 
75.39 and Chandler finished 
with a time of 98.91, giving 
them the the rankings of21 and 
28 out of 51 skiers. Silva did not 
finish the course.

such an even contest that the lead 
changed hands five times in a 
two-minute span. Spicuzza and 
sophomore Amy Buxbaum did 
most of the damage down the 
stretch as the half ended in a 
31-31 tie.
For the first five minutes of the 
second half, the game continued 
to be a stalemate, until the Bears 
went on a 15-6 run that put them 
ahead, 50-41. Washingtons lead 
held for the remainder of the 
game, even withstanding a pair 
of three-pointers by Spicuzza, who 
led the Tartans with 17 points. 
CMU was able to get as close as 
six points, but the Bears held the 
Tartans in the closing minutes to 
come out with the 72-64 win.
In other action, the Tartans 
started their Presidents Athletic 
Conference season with a 51-49 
win at Grove City, squeaking to 
victory on the strength of 
Spicuzza, Smith, and Chorgo, all 
of whom scored in double digits. 
Chorgo also added ten rebounds 
to help the Tartans cause.
This week, the Tartans attempt 
to solidify their position at the top 
of the PAC with a pair of confer
ence games. Today, they travel to 
Washington & Jefferson before 
returning for a Saturday game 
against Thiel. However the Tar
tans may be without the services 
of sophomore guard Katie Fahey, 
who is troubled by a thumb injury 
sustained in the Washington 
game.
Even though the team is suffer
ing through a tough slump, coach 
Seidl remains optimistic about the
Tartans chances.
Weve had a lot of changes 
where people have had to play 
different positions, but theyve 
handled it really well, explains 
Seidl. I like the attitude that this 
team is displaying. They give it 
their best every game.
In other action over break, the 
women stumbled upon their first 
loss of the season, 76-65, to Kean 
College in the Kean College tour
nament Dec. 28. High scorers were 
Smith with 19, Chorgo with 12, 
and Spicuzza with 11. High re
bounder was Buxbaum with 10. 
The next day, the Tartans lost 
their second one, this time to 
Otterbein, 6867 in overtime. 
High scorers were Smith and 
ODonnell with 19 and Spicuzza 
with 14. The high rebounder was 
Buxbaum again, this time with 
18.
At home after the new year, 
CMU rebounded with a 78-54 
win over NYU. Four Tartans, 
Fahey, Smith, Chorgo, and 
Spicuzza were in double figures 
against the Violets.
Rochester defeated CMU 5352. 
Spicuzza, Buxbaum, and Chorgo 
fouled out down stretch as the 
Tartans lost their first UAAgame 
in OT. The Tartans dug them
selves a hole by shooting less than 
30 percent in first half. High scor
ers were Fahey, ODonnell, and 
Smith. High rebounders were 
Spicuzza, Fahey, and Buist.
Rounding out the break, the 
Tartans fell to John Hopkins 
63-60 on Jan. 6, then came back 
home on the 13th to defeat Emory 
53-49.

opener against Grove City Col
lege last Tuesday. The Tartans 
won their only other game of the 
season in the last game before 
winter break, against Haverford 
College, 8379.
Its about time [we won], said 
Connors, weve been improving 
all year  although the scores 
dont indicate it.
The key was that at the end of 
the game when we needed a loose 
ball or a rebound, we got it. I 
thought that the first half, except 
for the last three minutes were 
played exceptionally well, said 
Anderson.
Numerous problems still exist, 
though. The defense has kept 
opponents below 80 points only 
twice all season and has contrib
uted to letdowns against Case 
Reserve and Emory.
Were not sound defensively, 
admitted Anderson after the loss 
to Washington.
Against the Bears, the Tartans 
were out-rebounded and turned 
the ball over 16 times to 
Washingtons four turnovers. Af
ter a tight first half, the Bears ran 
off 14 unanswered points to blow 
the game open and coast to a

the loss was Bronners career high

and it is asking for volunteers 
older than 18 to work on an out
patient basis. It is a 14 -week
session, and is free of charge.
According to Barbara Hoben, 
chief of Clinical Diatetic Services 
at WPIC, The preliminary re
sults of this have been incred
ible. Bulimic patients are put on 
one of four basic treatment tracks: 
cognitive therapy, nutritional 
counseling, a combination of the 
above two, or support sessions. 
Patients cant ask for a certain 
track, but there is always alter
native treatment offered at the 
end of the 14 weeks.
In a program such as this, cer
tain guidelines are used to treat 
a bulimic patient. Food records 
are generally kept of the three 
balanced meals and snack the 
patient is encouraged to eat.
Recovering bulimics should not 
necessarily be forced to gain or 
lose weight, said Hoben, so this 
program stresses keeping at a 
weight instead oftrying to change 
it.
Another part of this, as well as 
most treatments, is reducing die
tary restrain. From youth, we are 
shown good versus bad food 
from the media and our parents.
The goal is to erase all labels 
which are stuck on food, Hoben 
said. Therefore, patients are en
couraged to eat any food desired 
in modification. By makingbinge 
foods a part of the everyday diet, 
it is hoped that bulimics will get 
bored with them.
The WPIC program then pre
pares patients for discharge. They 
are taken on a supermarket tour 
which educates them on different 
kinds of food, and are taken to 
two restaurants for their final 
sessions.
Because smaller, slower 
changes are generally more per
manent than quick ones, patients 
learn to handle their problems 
one day at a time.
Any student interested in this 
program should phone 624-5420 
Monday through Friday, 9 am to 
5 pm. Other help for bulimia can 
be found in area hospitals, clin
ics, and through Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys own counseling cen
ter.

VIU coaches favor NCAA Proposal 30
!y ALIM RAY
Wan. Staffwriter
With the NCAA acceptance of 
roposal 30 came many concerned 
Kvision I basketball schools. This 
ong and complicated ruling was 
utended to reduce the time delands of athletes in all sports. 
However, the proposal affected 
lasketball the most  shortenag^he season to 25 games, movIthe practice starting day to 
lovember 1, and making the preeason conditioning starting date 
Ictober 1.
Division I schools are concerned 
bout the revenue they lose when 
ome games are cut out, but Larry 
jiderson and Gerri Seidl, Carneie; Mellons two basketball 
oaches, believe it is a good move. 
Anderson, CMUs mens basketall coach, sympathizes with the 
itent of Proposal 30 because he 
elieves the season is becoming 
rager and longer. Before the 
ulingDivision I schools had a 28- 
aipe regular season. This restricoit did not take into account the 
mall tournaments these schools 
layed which may have been two
or three games long.
A team that played in the NCAA 
tournament would have even 
more uncounted games in its 
schedule. If a team went to the 
Final Four in the NCAA tourna
ment, it could be possible for it to 
play approximately 40 games in 
one season, which is half of an 
NBA season.
Anderson stands by Proposal 
30 because it limits the traveling 
of teams. There is regular season 
travel for teams which takes a 
sizeable portion of class time, and 
then there are the small tourna
ments which are held throughout 
the country in such places as 
Alaska and Hawaii.
Seidl, the womens basketball 
coach, also agrees with the deci
sion but stresses the fact it does 
noteffectthe CamegieMellonDivision III program. The maximum 
number of games a Division III 
school could play before the rul
ing was 26. The conference that 
Carnegie Mellon has been in for 
the past few years, the Presidents 
Athletic Conference, only allowed 
22 games.
Since Carnegie Mellon has been

in the process of moving into the 
UAA, it has been allowed 26 
games, but rarely used them all. 
It [the ruling] is a positive step to 
heighten the athletics and en
hance the academics, said Seidl.
Dr. JohnH. Harvey, director of 
athletics and physical education 
at Carnegie Mellon, attended the 
NCAA conference where Proposal 
30 was passed. According to 
Harvey, it took five and one-half 
hours to accept before Proposal 
30, which had six by laws, four of
which had to be voted on seperately by each division.
According to Harvey, what al
lows Division I basketball pro
grams to breathe easily is that 
the effective date of Proposal 30 is 
in 1992. This means that the pro
posal could and probably will 
change in the next few years. A 
new amendment has already been 
proposed to change the starting 
date of the season to the last 
weekend in Novemeber from De
cember 1.

By MICHAEL D. C. DROUT
Tartan Staffwriter
An exciting season has 
shaped up in the NHL, with 
good races in each of the divi
sions. The second half should 
be even tighter, as several 
teams that had bad starts be
gin to pick up 
their produc
tion. In the 
second half of 
the season we 
will see if the 
New Jersey 
Devils are for 
real, if Detroit 
can rebound 
from an awful 
start, if the Is
landers are 
using up all 
their wins for 
the season in 
one month, if 
the Rangers 
will make a big trade to get out 
of the cellar, if Edmonton has 
fully recovered from The Trade, 
and if the Maple Leafs will hang 
on to a playoff berth.
Coach of the 1/2 year. Doug 
Carpenter of the Maple Leafs. 
Toronto is over .500 and in sec
ond place for the first time in 
years. Although every game is 
a shoot-out, the Leafs have the 
nucleus of a strong team .
Trade Rumors. The Rang
ers need to do something. The 
discussion has centered around 
Vanbiesbrouck and Patrick 
being traded for a big, scoring 
center, but the the Rangers have 
been playing so poorly that the 
value of their players has gone 
down. Now that Pittsburgh has 
snapped up Pederson, it looks 
as if the Rangers may have to 
suffer through the mess Espos
ito made last year.
The two more probable trades 
center around Ron Hextall and 
Kevin Dineen. The Flyers would 
like to trade Hextall for a scorer, 
but whether another team is 
willing to gamble on the goalies 
recovery remains to be seen. 
Kevin Dineen wants to leave 
Hartford, and the Devils may 
be able to pick him up for a pair 
of defensemen  Wolanin and 
Wienrichand the first-round
draft pick acquired from 
Toronto for Tom Kurvers. With 
Dineen, second only to Messier 
as a corner-man, the Devils 
might be able to get past Phila
delphia in the playoffs.
Mid-season MVP. Most 
valuable in the league has to be 
Mark Messier. Now that he is 
no longer 
trying to 
take over 
Gretzkys 
place, num
ber eleven 
has come 
into his own. 
Messier is so 
valuable be
cause he can 
outfight any
one in the 
corners and 
throws the 
hardest 
checks in the 
league. Most 
valuable to his team, however, 
has to be Pat Lafontaine, who is 
scoring twenty-six percent of 
the Islanders goals.
The Return of the Oilers. 
This year could end up being a 
replay of the 87-88 season, with 
the Oilers and Bruins meeting 
for the Cup final. The Oilers are 
playing solid team hockey, with 
an emphasis on defense that 
was missing during the Gretzky 
years. They may be able to do it.
The Patrick Race. As of 
writing time, there were six 
points separating first and last 
in the Patrick division. While 
the Rangers may head deeper 
into the cellar, the race will 
likely continue to be tight. The 
Devils are playing the most 
consistently right now, but with 
only a four point lead on Phila
delphia and the Islanders, noth
ing can be taken for granted. 
Philadelphia is the money team 
for the playoffs, but anything 
can happen in the second half of 
the season.
Rumors. Following the lead 
of the Jordan/Johnson one-onone charity game, there is a 
rumor that Gretzky and 
Lemieux may play a game 
against each .other,with the 
proceeds going to charity. Id. 
pay money to see it.

Forthe Carnegie Mellon hockey 
team, the return to the ice this 
Sunday was not a pleasant one. 
In their first match-up after the 
ng break, the out-of-condition, 
out-of-shape Tartans came up 
ghort against Penn State West, 
5-4, bombarded with defensive 
irrors that clouded their game. 
.Althoughthe score reflects only 
defecit of one point, Tartan Dave 
Collins said CMU was lacking 
much more than that.
^KWe played terribly, said
S8HomMso HoE 13mRE REr8E3H1 me84 I 
aErE3NH mr meE AmNeHp uIRHIe dIcE 
im88Ne1 1INa iy6 ,I1 8I35Nes UM3o 
UmRE HoIe HoIH
Collins.
He attributes the loss to poor 
forward and defense players who 
are out of shape and a little 
rusty.
He thinks the Tartans would 
have been much better off if they 
had passed the puck better and
played an all around tighter game.
Collins was grateful, however, 
for the spectacular goaltending 
of David Sealfon. The gap in the 
score would have been much wider 
without Sealfons playing. He 
saved us, said Collins.
Coupled with the lower-thanstandard play of the Tartans was 
the better-than-usual perform
ance of Penn State West, who 
took CMU off guard with its sur
prisingly good playing.
Penn State West really played 
above their heads, said Collins. 
They were ready for us and were 
really up for it.
Frustration seems to be the 
word of the day for the Tartans. 
We just couldnt get it together, 
said Collins.
Next weekend CMU takes to 
the ice against West Virginia at 
home. We hope to rebound and 
play much better, said Collins.

Smith is PAC star
Lisa Smith (Indiana, PA/Indiana), a 58 senior guard for 
Carnegie Mellon, was named 
the PAC player of the week after 
scoring 35 points and collecting 
18 rebounds in three games last 
week. Smith averaged 11.7 
points per game and scored a 
game-high 15 points against 
New York University while re
cording nine rebounds, eight 
steals and eight assists.
UAA honors Tartans

The University community 
returned to Carnegie Mellon in 
January 1980 to find that two 
dining areas had been unexpect
edly closed. The Bakery-Deli and 
Pinners Unlimited were shut 
down because there was a food 
service deficit of close to $100,000. 
jThis deficit accumulated over five 
months, causing Food Service to 
make some sudden changes.
The student body started pro
testing that there was no student 
input involved in any of the Food 
Service decisions. Food Service 
listened to the students and one 
week later it announced that the 
deli would reopen.
In March of1980, Oscar Mayer, 
director of auxiliary services (then 
called Director of Food Services) 
eceived a report on University
Food Service done by an inde
pendent company. He refused to 
release it to the public due to 
questions of privacy. The fol
lowing week, Mayer released an 
abbreviated version of the report, 
which contained many recommen
dations. In September 1981, stu
dents were still displeased with 
the food service and they held a 
demonstration outside of Kiltie 
Cafe.
Beginning with fall semester of 
1980, the administration decided 
to hand the helm of Food Services 
to an outside company. Under the 
previous management, Food Serv
ices lost $455,000 in one year. For 
the first year under the new man
agement, the Marriott Corpora
tion, University Dining Service 
actually made a profit.
A big issue at the beginning of 
the decade was the draft. In re
sponse to the issue, there was

/E yV(yB ,oIRloEAI ohu,oIIol AnoR, lRIAmIAo 0RAn Ano iHHl Lo,CRTo2
group on campus called CARD, 
Committee Against Registration 
and Draft. Student Senate re
jected CARDs proposals to get 
funding for various activities, 
including a public forum on the 
draft issue. At the following Stu
dent Senate meeting, Senate had 
to change its decision on the is
sue. Students packed themselves 
into the Wherrett Room in sup
port of CARD and Senate issued a 
statement;Acting in good con
science as the elected representa
tives of the student body, Senate 
does hereby officially express its 
opposition [to the draft]. On 
March 8, a CARD dance erupted 
in violence as several fights broke 
out. Several people were hurt and 
Security arrived to restore order.
In February 1980, Student 
Government President Scott Si
bley was impeached because he 
did not listen to the voters and he 
didnt do anything on the days 
popular topics. Before facing an 
official trial, Sibley resigned and 
Ralph Sherman took over as the 
student body president.
On March' 4, 1980, Student 
Senate requested that The Tar
tan not endorse a candidate for 
the upcoming Presidential elec
tions. Senate said that it had the 
right to make such a demand 
because The Tartan was a funded 
organization. The Tartan did not 
comply.
In September of 1980, the es
cort service started running. Also 
in September, the Peer Help cen
ter closed down for evalution. A 
week later, it was up and run
ning, but in October it was shut 
down permanently due to a lack 
of volunteers.
On September 30, WRCT 
started broadcasting in 10 watts 
of stereo power.
Architecture students started 
to become concerned in late 1980 
about what the administration 
was doing to them. Several times 
in past months, students had 
asked Louis Sauer, head of the 
Architecture Department, where 
he was taking the department. 
He did not reply and the students 
started to become restless. Fi
nally, in November, Sauer re
leased a report outlining the 
departments goals.
In December of 1980, the bill to 
sell the Bureau of Mines complex 
to Carnegie Mellon passed the 
United States Senate. That January, President Carter signed the 
bill. But it took until September 
1985 for the Bureau of Mines 
complex to be officially acquired 
by Carnegie Mellon.
In January 1980, Westinghouse 
announced plans to sponsor a 
Robotics Institute for Carnegie 
Mellon. After finding some space 
on campus, the Robotics Institute 
opened in December of 1980.
On February 28,1981, the first 
Beaux Arts Ball of the decade was 
held. 1300 students turned out 
for the all-night party. The theme 
was Le Bal Fantasie.
In April 1981, it was announced 
that work would begin on the 
Margaret Morrison storefronts 
during the summer.
In October 1981, Wean Hall was 
officially named after Raymond 
Wean, and President Cyert pro
posed a new dorm to be built be
tween Mudge and Morewood 
Gardens.
1982 started with Entropy 
moving to the basement of Skibo. 
Student Senate agreed that a new 
dorm was the only solution to the 
growing housing problem, while 
the Housing Office proposed to 
house CMU men in Chatham

dorms. A committee was also 
formed by Student Senate to look 
into building the new student 
center. The Beaux Arts Ball, 
scheduled for September 1982, 
was postponed because of con
cerns over alcohol. Two months 
later, 500 students protested a 19 
percent tuition hike, by throwing 
cookies at Warner Hall and shout
ing, Let them eat cookies!
In February 1983, a student 
was expelled after he was caught 
selling cocaine on campus. The 
Margaret Morrison Co-op opened 
and the weight room was closed 
after a student contracted a rare 
skin disease. In November, an
other student was expelled for 
selling drugs and a fifteen-yearold freshman crashed the entire 
EDU system. The freshman was 
going to be expelled, but he 
reached an agreement with the 
administration and he left CMU 
with nothing on his permanent
record.
In February 1984, a student 
senator called the Liquor Control 
Board and informed them of a 
Senate party where alcohol would 
be served. The LCB arrested four 
senators, who were arraigned. The 
senator who made the initial 
phone call resigned from Senate 
after the incident occurred.
On April 13, 1984, University 
Computing Center opened its 
doors to the public and WRCT 
went to 100 watts of power in 
time for Carnival. On May 1, 22 
students were failed out of Ori
gins of the Modem World, when 
they allegedly plagiarized each 
others work. And in November 
1984, the Department of Defense 
gave Carnegie Mellon the Soft
ware Engineering Institute con
tract.
1985 started with a preview

Sweepstakes 90 is, for all in
tents and purposes, well under
way. By this time, all competing 
organizations have already braketested (all buggies must have 
working brakes before they are 
able to race) their buggies and 
bave begun making their prelimi
nary choices for push teams and 
drivers.
Sweepstakes, or buggy, is one 
of the oldest traditions at Carne
gie Mellon. In fact, it is probably 
ihe only one that is still observed 
with such spirit and vitality. Ever 
since CIA won the event in 1981, 
becoming the first non-Greek 
organization to ever win, Sweep
stakes has gained added signifi
cance as a University-wide com
petition. The 1990s will bring 
larsher rivalries, greater technlogy, and even more powerful 
athletes to buggy competition. 
Ever since the early days of 
Jggy, the inter-fraternity rival
ries were the main focus of atten
tion. As the independent organi
zations began to gain prominence, 
-he event took on the characterisc of being the competitive bataground between the Greeks and 
the independents. The listing of 
the top ten fastest buggies is a 
clear indication of the intense 
;ompetition between the two 
groups.
While most buggy fans tend to 
focus upon the mens races, the 
Womens races have begun to take 
an importance of their own as 
finishing times have been faster 
han most of the pack in the mens 
leats.
Because of the intensity of the 
competition, groups are very se
cretive about their buggies and 
extremely protective of their driv
es. A buggy that is suspected of 
having a special suspension sysm is a prime target for spies and 
Possibly even sabotage. Likewise, 
totense pressure is often put on
the drivers to keep their weight 
down and to practice maneuver
ing the buggy.
Every year, the teams try to 
make special improvements to 
their buggies. Occasionally, teams 
are even bold enough to construct 
whole new buggies. This can prove 
to be a very costly and difficult 
task and the decision to build a 
new one is not taken lightly. One 
should keep in mind that most 
teams have more than one buggy. 
Each buggy is designated as the A 
(considered to be the fastest 
buggy), B, C, or in some cases 
even D class. Likewise, there are 
A, B, C, and D class push teams.
Some improvements to make 
the buggies faster may violate the 
very rigid safety measures en
forced by the Sweepstakes Com
mittee. When Buggy first began, 
several drivers and even bystand
ers were injured as the buggies 
would careen into turns out of 
control. The Sweepstakes Safety 
Committee tests each buggy for 
safety and makes sure every 
driver knows how to handle his or 
her respective buggy.
The most controversial safety
regulation came last year when 
two-wheel buggies were outlawed. 
Until then, Delta Upsilon had 
made a definite bid to break the 
two-wheel barrier, the next 
great technological jump for buggy 
technology. The buggy had a few 
very good runs on the course, but 
when it fell over, the Safety 
Committee decided the risks out
weighed the benefits.
Aside from technology, the other 
great factor of Sweepstakes is 
that it is an athletic competition. 
The pushers train by running to 
develop speed and stamina on the 
hills. Those that push hills one 
and three must also have a good 
deal of upper body strength be
cause of the steepness of those 
hills, while hills four and five are 
more flat and are considered speed 
hills. Good push teams have 
proven superior to fast buggies; 
Sweepstakes insiders almost 
always favor better athletes over 
better buggies.
However, buggy is unique in 
that it encompasses both technol
ogy with athletic ability, perhaps 
the reason it appeals to such a di
verse group of people.

The CMU Greeks faced many troubles in the 80s...
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
The Eighties saw many changes 
in the Greek system here at Car
negie Mellon. One fraternity was 
dismissed after several incidents 
and two other fraternities were 
put on probation. The Interfrater
nity Council was disbanded and 
replaced by the Greek Council.
Troubles began in the summer 
of 1982 when Alpha Tau Omega 
was put on probation and had its 
house closed after being cited for 
throwing glass bottles from their 
porch onto the street.
Less than a month later, Zeta 
Beta Tau stole real tombstones 
from the storage area of a local 
cemetery for its haunted house 
party. Before the party started 
GMU security asked the house to 
return the stones and the frater
nity complied.
In November 1982, the frater
nities voiced their complaints 
about housing. The fraternities 
felt that the administration was 
being hostile to them. Theyve 
got a noose around our neck and 
they are doing everything to 
tighten the noose,said, Keith 
Block, then-president of Pika, 
jiraden Walter, then-dean of 
Student Affairs, replied by stat
ing that the hostility was directed 
at those fraternity brothers who 
gave pledges a list of things to 
steal.
Two months later, in January, 
ATO wasplacedonprobation after 
being involved in incidents of 
public nudity, theft, and injuries 
to a student.
Probation means that a frater
nity can not involve itself in Car
nival, Greek Sing, IM sports, or 
advertise its parties.
 In April 1983, ZBT was put on 
probation. Members of the frater
nity stated that they did not know 
jvhy they were being put on pro
bation. The administration re
plied by saying that incidents had 
been reported to security. Several 
people gave various accounts of 
what happened on a specific night 
where several fights broke out. 
The administration blamed ZBT 
for the fights and put the house 
on probation. Earlier in the year, 
Delta Upsilon was put on proba
tion for several thefts, so ZBTs 
Suspension put three fraternities 
Ion probation simultaneously.
September 1983 started out as 
a good month for the fraternities

but ended on a bad note. On Sep
tember 6, ATO was reinstated as 
a full fraternity.
On the 17th of that month, three 
freshmen were taken to the hos
pital after drinking too much at 
ZBT. The first freshman had 
consumed 24 shots of whiskey in 
about 20 minutes. He was taken 
back to his room where he went 
into convulsions.
Security took him to the hospi
tal where a nurse was reported as 
saying if he had arrived five 
minutes later he would have died. 
The other two students were in 
better condition when they ar
rived at the hospital.
Even though no one was seri
ously injured, ZBT was again put 
on probation.
A year later, ZBT was reinstated 
as a full fraternity, only to be sus
pended for an entire semester due 
to an incident that occurred three 
weeks later. In early October 
about thirty ZBT brothers were 
involved in a fight in front of 
Margaret Morrison apartments. 
The fight resulted in several inju
ries and the dismissal of ZBT. 
ZBT immediately responded with 
an appeal.
In November 1984, an incident 
involving Pi Lambda Phi, Theta 
Xi and Sigma Nu left a Pilam 
brother in the hospital. The inci
dent started with a dispute be
tween Pilam and Theta Xi alumni.
A Pilam brother got the wrong 
impression that the Zoo was re
sponsible and climbed onto the 
roof of the Zoo.
On the roof of the Zoo, he ac
cidently fell through a skylight 
and he hit the ground three floors 
below. No charges were pressed 
and the Pilam brother was re
leased from the hospital with 
minor injuries.
In Januaiy 1985, ZBT lost its 
appeal and its house. A month 
later, IFC rejected ZBTs motion 
for campus housing.
In September of 1985, the 
empty ZBT house was used as an 
all-male dorm to help with the 
housing crunch.
In March of 1985, Alpha Epsi
lon Pi, announced their plans to 
try and gain a chapter on campus.
In February 1986, IFC recom
mended a replacement for the now 
extinct ZBT; its recommendation 
was for Kappa Delta Rho.
An unfortunate accident in 
April ofl986 left three ATO broth
ers and their buggy burned.
In January of 1987, the hous
ing office started to work on the 
fraternity houses. On March 14, 
1987SigmaTauGammareceived 
its charter and officially became a 
fraternity.
On November 17,1987, the IFC 
again voted to put ATO on proba
tion. The incidents leading to this 
probation included a fight on
pledge night between ATO and 
DU which left several DU broth
ers injured.
The following weekend, the 
Liquor Control Board raided two 
fraternities and arrested about 
150 students. Pi Kappa Alpha and 
Delta Tau Delta were both hav
ing parties and at 1:20 in the 
morning the LCB stormed the 
two fraternities arresting every
one inside.
Most of the students were con
victed and sentenced to fifteen 
hours of community service. Sev
eral students were charged with 
serving alcohol to minors.
Several days later, CMU Presi
dent Richard Cyert condemned 
the police raids and the Univer
sity hired a lawyer to defend the 
students.
In January 1988, Ron Campana, the fraternity advisor, 
advised the fraternities to make 
their parties less overt. This was 
directly related to the LCB raids 
which took place two months 
before.
In October of 1988, the 
Panhellenic Society announced 
that the sororities were withdrawingfrom IFC until certain changes 
were made in the organization.
Two weeks later, the Council of
Fraternal Presidents approved 
proposal to reorganize the Greek' 
system because of some of tfJ 
same concerns that the sororitie-' had.
This new organization would 
only be a information center for' 
the Greeks and not a ruling body
In January 1989, an anony! 
mous proposal suggested that the 
Greeks get a 37 percent kickbackfrom their activities fee because 
most Greeks did not participate 
in other campus organizations 
The debate continued until ] 
in the semester when the pro. 
posal was withdrawn.
Despite all of the bad publicitythat the Greeks have gotten over 
the years, they have also done a 
great deal for local and national, 
charities. Every year, the Greeks 
take part in Greek Sing, a big fun.

Greek Singis probably the most 
popular and largest charity func
tion at Carnegie Mellon. Held 
overy spring, all of the Greeks
that can participate in the event, 
do so.
Preparations for this massive 
charity eventbeginfarin advance. 
The competition is second only to 
Sweepstakes and Booth.
There are three categories in

Greek Sing. First, there is the fra
ternity division, in which only 
fraternity brothers and pledges 
can participate.
The second division is the so
rority division, where the soroities compete.
The final division is the mixed 
category, where a fraternity ei
ther teams up with a sorority or 
uses its little sisters in the pro
duction.
In the past decade, two Greek 
houses have tied for the number 
of Greek Sing titles.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon has won 
the fraternity division five times, 
most recently with last years 
productionAiref Mis&eAawn. The 
houses other winningproductions 
include: H.M.S. Pinafore (1980), 
The Mikado (1982), La Cage Aux 
Follies (1986), and Berlin to 
Broadway (1987).
The other Greek house to win 
five Greek Singtitles in the Eight
ies is Kappa Alpha Theta. Thetas 
winning productions include; Ol
iver (1981), Cats (1984), Aint Misbehavin (1985), West Side Story 
(1986) and Anything Goes (1988).
Two other houses in the soror
ity division have captured titles 
in the preceding decade. Delta 
Delta Delta has captured first 
place four times, Sweet Charity 
(1980), Fame (1982), Starting 
Here, Starting Now (1983), and 
Chicago (1987).
The only other house to win 
first place in the sorority division 
was Kappa Kappa Gamma, who 
won last year with their produc
tion of Sugar Babies.

JASON SPEAKS
by Jason Lee Smith
Daedaelus And Icarus
Once there was an evil king 
named Minos, who lived in actroDg fortress on an island. Ring
jftnos decided that he wanted a 
maze built under his fortress, so 
that he might attract more tour
ists to his kingdom during the offSo he called the greatest engi
neer of the land, whose name was 
Daedaelus, which no one could 
Spell right, and asked him to build 
the maze.
Daedaelus replied, No, for you 
are an evil tyrant, and I will not 
build anything for you, especially 
when Im so close to getting that 
research grant.
Minos flew into a rage and sent 
Daedaelus and his son Icarus to 
live in the highest tower of his 
fortress, until Daedaelus changed 
his mind.
But Daedaelus was a clever old 
man, and assoonashewaslocked 
in the tower he began working on 
a means of escape.
He made two pairs of wings out 
of wax,feathers, andabitof twine. 
With these, he said, we shall be 
able to fly from this prison to 
safety.
He put on a pair of his wings 
and helped his son Icarus into a 
pair. Icarus said to his revered 
father, Oh, revered father, not to 
knock your ability or anything, 
but are you sure these things can 
fly?
Oh ye of little faith! My hand 
was guided by Athena, goddess of 
wisdom and potted plants. These 
wings are a gift from the gods, 
and we should not doubt them. 
You go first.
Thus chastened, Icarus jumped 
out the window, and plummeted 
three-hundred feet to his death.
Daedaelus quickly tossed his pair 
of wings out the window after his 
beloved son, and began drawing 
up plans for a maze.
Moral: Trust in Athena, but 
carry a parachute.
Prometheus
A very long time ago, there was 
a god named Prometheus. He 
loved the human race as his own 
children, which many of them 
were, but we wont go into that 
because its a very sordid story 
which probably wouldnt get past 
the censors, anyway.
He loved the human race in 
spite of the fact that most of them 
wore leaves or dirty animal skins, 
and ate nothing but raw grizzly 
bear, except for the Epsteins who 
lived in a better part of town.
This pathetic state of affairs 
made Prometheus very sad, and 
so he stole fire from the great god 
Zeus, so that his children and the 
Epsteins might eat cooked grizzly 
bear once in a while.
Zeus grew angry at this and 
said to Prometheus, You putz!
What were you thinking of? Do 
you have any idea what my heat
ing bill is going to be like this 
month? Whatdo you think, money 
grows on trees or something? 
Prometheus replied to the king 
of all gods, Sorry.
Yeah, right! Try telling that to 
the gas company.
And so Zeus ordered Prom
etheus chained to a rock. And 
every day, an eagle would come to 
Prometheus and eat his liver. And 
every night, Prometheus liver 
would grow back, which made all 
concerned extremely nauseated, 
including the eagle.
Moral: No one likes liver.
Pygmalion
Once there was a sculptor 
named Pygmalion. Pygmalionhad 
trouble with women. They were 
either too short or too tall; too fat 
or too skinny. He could never find 
one whom he thought was per
fect. This earned him the reputa
tion of a nit-picker, and he wasnt 
invited to any parties.
One day he made a statue of the
most beautiful woman in the 
world, and fell madly in love with 
it. (He didnt get out much.) All he 
could talk about to his friends 
was the beauty of his statue; this 
caused him to be invited to even 
less parties.
Finally, Venus, at the insistence 
of Pygmalions few remaining 
friends, gave life to his beloved 
statue. This overjoyed Pygmalion, 
and he showered his new wife 
with gifts and affection.
Then, one day, Venus returned 
to Pygmalions household, and at 
the request of Hilda (did I forget 
to mention that the statues name 
was Hilda?), turned Pygmalion 
into a statue.
Everyone else lived happily ever 
after.
Moral: There is no bigger pain 
in the neck than a man in love.
Bill And The Nymph
Once there was a very ugly lady, 
who was very afraid that she 
would grow up to be an old maid.
One day, at a party, she met a 
man called Bill.
Lets get married, she said to 
Bill, after he had had a few glasses 
of punch.
No, he replied, Youre too 
ugly. Bill was no bargain either, 
thought the lady, but beggars cant 
be choosers.
Im really a nymph traveling 
in disguise, said the lady.
Really? asked Bill.
Really, said the lady.
Bill, realizing that nymphs were 
among the loveliest women in the 
world, agreed to marry the lady.
They got married and lived in a 
little suburban split level, had 
two children, both of whom went 
on to be doctors, and they both 
lived to a ripe old age.
In his golden years, Bill would 
look back on his life, and think 
about how lucky he was, after all, 
not everybody marries a nympho
Moral: As long as theres 
sucker born every minute, beauty, 
will always be in the eye of the 
beholder.

The significant development 
I see is in the attention thats 
been focused on the quality of 
life and the confidence and so
cial esteem of the students. 
Comingout ofthe Eighties there 
is more of a sense of community 
and a more positive self confi
dence on campus.
Hugh D. Young
Professor of Physics
One thing that comes to mind 
is the tremendous expansion in 
new areas of research, such as the 
expansion of software develop
ment, the Robotics Institute, and 
Linguistics, just to name a few. I 
think those are among the things 
that have beefed up the stature 
that the University has in a na
tional and international sense. I 
think we are a much more visible 
University than we were ten years 
ago.
Students are very much con
cerned about using the degree as 
a stepping stone to a good job and 
a comfortable, affluent lifestyle. 
Im not saying that thats good or 
bad. I do think that one of the 
effects that it has is that the 
anxiety level among the under
graduate students gets higher and 
higher every year, and I wish it 
werent so.

One of the major changes in 
the last ten years is that the 
Quality of Life Task Force has 
raised some issues. One is the 
whole notion about what kind of 
things do we offer students be
yond academics? You see an in
crease in the notion of diversity 
and multicultural programs, and 
you see a commitment from the 
campus administration, the fac
ulty, and staff that this is an issue 
that needs to be addressed. There 
is a commitment to having stu
dents feel less like a number and 
more a part of the University so 
that there is a sense of belonging 
which is an outgrowth of the 
Quality of Life Task Force.
The Eighties have shown a' 
great deal of concern and inter-' 
est in the quality of the educa
tion that students receive here 
and in the quality of life. In the 
last few years, the interest and 
concern with the development 
of the new student center is a 
manifestation of what I think 
has built up over the last ten 
years. When I came here, there 
was very little carpet in the 
library, very little light, no 
comfortable chairs, and I thinkthe University has responded. 
Also, the hustle and bustle and 
entrepreneurship of the place 
has certainly accelerated and 
has been successful in making 
a national and international 
name for Carnegie Mellon.

By JOHN CARLISLE
Special to The Tartan
Several weeks ago, the Army 
ROTC Rangers of theScots Guard 
Battalion returned early from 
their semester breaks to partici
pate in a nine day field training 
exercise at Camp Dawson, West 
Virginia. The objective of the 
training was to sharpen militaiy 
skills in cold weather, and locate 
sites for the battalion exercise 
scheduled for March at Camp 
Dawson.
On their first day at Camp 
Dawson, the Scots Guard Rang
ers, under supervision from 
members of the 19th Special 
Forces Group (Green Berets), 
remained on base and acted as 
chief instructors for a Marine 
Reserve unit from New Kensing
ton Pennsylvania. Cadet Rang
ers instructed over 100 Marines 
on the fine arts of rope bridging, 
rappeling seats, and knot tying.

Training ended with all the re
servists getting a chance to con
struct and cross a one-rope bridge 
on their own.
The Scots Guard Rangers then
headed for the mountains. After a 
final camp location was chosen, a 
three and a half mile hike up the 
mountain with sixty pound ruck
sacks was required to reach it.
Once at the patrol base, cadets 
searched for a safe water source, 
constructed pancho shelters, and 
prepared for six cold days in the 
field.
The Scots Guard Rangers were 
broken into four-man reconnais
sance teams that would work and 
eat together during their stay in 
the field.
A typical day included large 
area recon patrols for one team 
while the remaining teams were 
instructed by Ranger Advisor 
Mater Sergeant KuChin. Topics 
of instruction included choosing 
patrol base, locating and setting 
up airborne drop zones and heli
copter landing zones, encrypting 
and decrypting messages, and 
various tricks of the trade.
Instructed material was con
stantly being worked into patrol 
missions. One team conducted a 
12-hour patrol to complete a per
sonal meeting with an unknown 
partisan to receive and decrypt 
further instructions.
Six days in the field in belowfreezing temperatures tested the 
cadet Rangers preparation, 
adaptability, endurance, and
ability to work together as a team 
Long-range recon patrols without the luxury of tents, fires, or 
sleeping bags did little for physi
cal comfort but improved team 
unity and morale.
In the midst of a snowstorm 
that would eventually deposit six 
inches of snow on them in just a 
few hours, the Scots Guard Rang
ers packed up and made their 
descent from the mountains.
When the exercise was com
plete, sites for the future battal
ion patrol bases and possible land
ing zones for Chinook helicopters 
had been reconned. The practical 
experience and terrain familiari
zation that the Rangers gained 
will allow them to aid the 
battalions future activities at 
Camp Dawson.
The Rangers of the Scots Guard 
are looking forward to their next 
exercise in early March when they 
will act as opposing forces for the 
19th Special Forces Group.
Will Roseanne Barr be the person of the Nineties, or will we be saved?
LA VIE EN JAVI
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
That the Nineties are finally 
here comes as no big surprise. We 
probably have enough lame
brained optimism left over from 
the Eighties to last us into the 
next millenium. What will come 
as a big surprise will be if the 
Nineties live up to their hype. I 
have not yet discounted the possi
bility that the events of1989 may 
only be a very enticing but grossly 
misleading trailer to a decade 
which may be known as Eighties 
II.
And why not? The Eighties 
' themselves were a sorry sequel to 
| the Seventies. At least the Seven
ties had a sick, demented taste
lessness all of their own. In the 
Eighties we settled for a pale 
shadow of the excesses of the 
Seventies, all somewhat attenu
ated by the combined spectres of 
disease, cynicism, narrow lapels, 
cheap white wine and a faint sense 
of longing for the tye-dyed under
wear we never burned.
The way I see it, the Nineties 
will not truly begin until 1993 
(around August, I think,) by which 
time we will have finally shaken 
off the last vestiges of the Eight
ies. Since most of what is remem
bered as the Sixties actually took 
place in the years between 1968 
and 1973, I have a feeling that 
most of the nostalgia for the Six
ties which we encountered in the 
past decade is actually part of an 
effort to displace a few unsavory 
memories of prodigality, promis
cuity and polyester.
Whether the yippies became the 
yuppies or the hipsters became 
the hucksters is not important. 
What is important is that We had 
better get used to the fact that 
like them or not, we are going to 
be stuck with Bon Jovi, Dan 
Quayle, the Donny Osmond come
back, the war on drugs, and Rose
anne Barr for at least the next 
two years.
Before you fault me for hopping 
on the blast-the-previous-decade bandwagon which normally 
accompanies a year with a zero at 
its end, let me say that I feel 
neither nostalgia nor resentment 
for the Seventies, or the Eighties, 
for that matter. I am sure that the 
Eighties and the Seventies both 
had their high and low points, but 
lets face it, chances are I was too 
busy growing up to be all that 
aware of it. The Nineties, on the 
other hand, I view with a pro
nounced mixture of dread and 
panic. This is particularly true 
when I consider that this is the 
decade in which I will grow up, 
graduate, find gainful employ
ment, try to change the world, get 
married and start a family. Stop 
that laughing!
This is an even more frighten
ing prospect when I consider that 
ten years ago the most pressing 
concern in my existence was find
ing the spare change with which 
to buy the new Duran Duran 
single. Stop that laughing! Any 
member of my generation who 
bothers to compare the thoughts 
they were having in 1970 and 
1980 with the thoughts they are 
now harboring will probably be 
able to identify with what I am 
saying. To others, the thoughts 
they are having in 1990 (Dude, I 
love the new Stones album) are 
probably not all that different 
from the thoughts they were 
having in 1980 (Babe, I love that 
new Stones album) or even 1970 
(Man, I love that new Stones 
album).
Ultimately it is not so much a 
matter of the times being inter
esting as much as being inter
ested in the times. Recently the 
whats hot/whats not list in a 
city paper declared that nostalgia 
is out and futurism is in. The 
would-be Mr. Blackwell who 
compiled this list was probably 
unaware of the the fact that the 
term futurists usually refers to 
a somewhat misguided group of 
proto-fascist Italian artists and 
poets who gleefully extolled the 
virtues of modem warfare until 
the Great War rolled along and 
showed them a thing or two. 
Barring the idea that we all start 
killing each other for the glory of 
the fatherland, I suppose the trend 
toward futurism means that in
stead of yearning for a past that 
was never truly ours, we can now

look forward to a future we wont 
have anything to do with.
Having spent the bulk of my 
winter break watching annoying 
T.V. specials in which everybody 
and their pet llama summarized, 
analyzed, decoded and de-fuzzed 
the previous decade, I feel as if 
anything I could possibly say 
about the present and past dec
ade would probably be redundant.
Of course, redundancy and insig
nificance have never stopped 
anybody before; how else can we 
explain that in one of these docu
mentaries we were subjected to 
Roseanne Barrs speculations on 
the socioeconomic trends which 
will shape the Nineties?
Maybe the answer lies in being 
presentists to avoid becoming 
anesthetized by the combined
forces of futurism, nostalgia, and 
Roseanne Barr and to worry about 
working with what we have and 
who we have to work it out with. 
Maybe if we stop wasting pre
cious brain cells over whether or 
not we can conceive our own 
Woodstock (or whether or not we 
were conceived at Woodstock) we 
may be able to come up with 
something original for a change.
There is hope; after all, I just read 
that the Bagwan Shree Rajneesh 
is dead. Maybe the Seventies and 
Eighties will give way a lot sooner 
than expected. Now, if only we 
could get someone to work on Bon 
Jovi, Dan Quayle, the Donny 
Osmond comeback, and Roseanne 
Barr....
At this point its only fair to 
inform you that my editor has 
placed a once-a-semester limit on 
my column becoming preachy and 
bombastic. Having reached my 
limit, Ill go back to being funny 
next week. Some claim I have 
nothing to go back to. Fk them.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  23 January 1990L7
Is this radio and why is Hamerschlags nose so shiny?
Good morning sports fans and 
/elcome to todays edition of 
[ports News brought to you by a 
ally great beer....
Uh, excuse me Eric. Could I talk 
, you for just a minute ? I have 
omething I have to tell you.
For those of you in our listening 
udience that dont know, this is 
ffly roommate, Nathan. Say hello
o our audience Nathan.
Ah, um, hi....
Nathan is our resident comuter expert and electrical gen
us, but he is not a famous sport 
igure. So why dont you go away, 
ant you see Im trying to do a 
how here?
Thats what I want to talk toyou 
bout.
Whadda ya mean? Did you go 
ut and take up a sport while I 
wasnt looking? All right, come 
on, tell me, what is it? No, on 
second thought, let me guess. Is it 
ross country speed walking? Or 
lerhaps, downhill roller.... 
NoEric, would you just shut up 
nd listen to me!
HIT AND MYTH
by Eric J. McAnallen
Now Nate, you dont need to get 
all huffy about it, just calm down 
and tell me whats so important 
that you have to interrupt my 
show to tell me.
Thats just it, you're not the host 
of a sports show!
Im not?
No, and this is not radio.
Oh, well in that case, would you 
mind telling me just what it is 
that Im supposed to be doing? I 
mean, after all, its been a long 
time, you know with finals and 
Christmas break and everything, 
that I, uh, forgot.
Let me put it this way. Youre a 
writer and this is a newspaper.
Oh yeah, now I remember. 
Thanks Nate, now get out of here.
Welcome to the new semester, 
and speaking of the new semes
ter, did you see those long lines on 
registration day? Obviously the 
wait was the result of switching 
over from slow tedious man labor 
to quick efficient computer proc
essing. Well, we cant win them 
all.
Like other poor students who 
had really important things to do, 
like signing loan checks and fluff
ing their pet hamsters, I stood in 
line for hours at my appointed 
time. It was one of those long 
snaking lines that went from the 
entrance way, back through Grey 
Matter, past the Tartan, across 
the cut and into Baker Hall.
It was there, in that line, that I 
came across another of the 
campuss great myths. As I waited 
ever so patiently for my turn, I 
found myself face to face with the 
shiny nose of Artie Hamerschlag.
According to the Freshman 
Word, that indispensable publi
cation that every upperclass guy 
loves to look through in order to 
google at the incoming freshman 
girls, For decades, students have 
been rubbing Hamerschlags nose 
before exams as a measure of good 
luck.
Well, during my confinement to 
the resistrars line o death, I got 
to thinking, does Arties nose 
really give off some sort of luck, do 
students really rub Arties nose, 
and how does Artie feel about all 
of this?
In my three years here at won
derful CMU, I have never seen 
anyone who is not a part of one of 
those roaming tour groups even 
look at Arties nose. This got me to 
wondering. How in the world did 
Arties nose get to be so shiny? I 
mean obviously, no one in his right 
mind would ever rub a silly piece 
of copper before taking an exam. 
If youre that hard up before a 
test, Arties nose sure aint gonna 
help ya.
To find the answer to this ques
tion, I set up a hidden camera
pointed at the nose on Friday, 
quiz day, to see if there was any 
truth to the myth. I left it there 
overnight. In case youre wonder
ing, it was an extended play tape, 
good for forty eight hours.
While reviewingthe tape infast 
forward the next day, I counted 
thirty artists drawing the stair
well, twenty couples passionately 
kissing goodbye, one guy admir
ing himself in the window, four
teen dogs, twelve stray salaman
ders, ten police officers, twenty 
doughnuts, ten cups of coffee, one 
motorcycle gang reciting 
Shakespeare (Macbeth nonethe
less), and three Chemists experi
menting with Kiltie food. Unfor
tunately, no one rubbed Arties 
nose.
As the tape progressed, the 
hallways of Baker began to empty 
out. The cameras built in clock 
told me that it was around three 
am when two suspicious looking 
creatures emerged from the broom 
closet. They were wearing cute 
little pointed hats and only stood
about three feet tall. I couldnt se 
their faces because they had the: 
backs to the camera.
One of them was carrying a 
bottle of Mr. Clean and the other 
had an old, well-used rag. They 
each had a small, wooden stoo 
which they slid along the grounc 
behind them.
It was at this time that the tape 
went dead. I will never know what 
caused the blackout in Baker that 
night. It could have been a water 
leak in the Physical Plant build
ing, or a great disturbance in the 
Force, as if millions of people 
suddenly cried out and then were 
silenced. However, I never will 
find out if those two little guys 
polished Arties nose. Maybe some 
night Ill camp out and see for 
myself.

myths around campus.
CMU student travels to Italy as a student diplomat
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Culture shock was something 
ew to Joelle Mellon. She has 
ived in Pennsylvania most of her 
ife and traveling to another coun,ry was a very different experierience. She toured Italy late 
ast October with two other people 
rom Texas and a group of Italian 
teenagers.
The program was sponsered by 
iinmeccanica, which is owned by 
he IRI Group, the largest statewned conglomerate. Finmeccanca has recently started expandng internationally and to help 
orm better relations with its US
companies, Finmeccanica sponsers a program that allows the 
children of the employees of its 
American companies to visit It
aly.
Mellons father works for Un
ion Switch and Signal Inc., which 
was recently bought by Finmec
canica. She was selected to par
ticipate in the program based on 
her SAT scores from a group of 
other sons and daughters of 
United Switch and Signal em
ployees.
It was just an incredible expe
rience to be somewhere with that 
much history, said Mellon. As a 
creative writing major, she was 
greatly interested in Italys cul
tural background.
She knew something of Italys 
culture from being involved in 
Latin in high school, but she still 
wasnt prepared for the vast dif
ferences between America and 
Italy.
She mentioned that the Italian 
youths who were her own age 
acted so much younger, They 
were so much more open. In Italy, 
everyone was crazy. When she 
went to a local discotheque, the 
It ah an dancing made American 
dancing seem inhibited by com
parison.
In Italy, she noticed different 
views on family and independ
ence. Their whole mindset is
:pLH ,I1 'M1H 1m ,ENRa Hm E Ne I A8I3E 
,oERE 4mM ,ERE HoE IemUm84CCCC LHQ1 
IUINes Hm rNea mMH om, UM3o 4mM 
amexH 5em, ImMH I rmRENse 3mMeHR4."
 /mE88E yE88me
more family oriented. They were 
shocked that I moved away from 
home for college.
She also said that the Italians 
had some very interesting views 
on Americans. They think that 
Americans are very free... They 
get a lot of American movies and
music so they think that were 
like that.... They think that we 
are such individuals.
When asked what college was 
like for them in Italy, she said, 
They live at home and its just 
like high school.... They special
ize a lot more, though. A girl that
I was friends with whose major ijs 
biology is going to an entire uni
versity where everybody is a biol
ogy major.
She said that Italy was very 
beautiful. Italy doesnt have the 
same types of cities with skyscrap
ers and huge department stores. 
There are no malls. They just 
have little shops that close at 
seven. A lot of people just sit out
side and sell things.
She said that the entire pro
gram was very impressive and 
different. It was just so weird to 
be in a place where you were the 
anomoly.... Its amazing to find 
out how much you dont kno^v 
about a foreign country.
Student Ambassadors bridge the gap 
between CMU and the outside world
By ERIC J. MCANALLEN
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
There needs to be an extension 
f the University Relations staff, 
and there needs to be student 
input when visitors come to our 
ampus, said Lisa Lane, coordi
nator of Carnegie Mellons Stuent Ambassadors.
The Ambassadors are a student 
rganization that has been servng the campus community since 
September 1987. It is their duty 
o act as mediators between the 
Jniversity and its visitors. They 
ontribute to Carnegie Mellons 
public relations by hosting camus events, conducting campus 
tours, and greeting special guests 
and visitors.
According to Lane, the Ambasadors are an invaluable extenion of the Public Relations Deartment. The administration 
an talk all it wants about how 
great Carnegie Mellon is, but a 
;udents perspective would be 
ifferent. There are a lot of people 
who come here and ask what it is 
ike to be a student at Carnegie 
Mellon, and as a faculty member 
or staff, you cant, answer that 
question, said Lane.
It is this student perspective 
that many visitors and VIPs are 
seeking and it is thi^ perspective 
that makes the Ambassadors so 
invaluable an aspect of the Uni
versities relations, yisitors are 
given a chance to see jthe Univer
sity from the inside though the

eyes of their Ambassadors.
Even though they are a young 
organization, they already have 
an impressive track record. The 
Ambassadors have already par
ticipated with events such as the 
opening of the Software Engineer
ing Institute, the national confer
ence of the Council for the Ad
vancement of Science Writing, 
Parents Day, the Fairless Lec
tures, and Whats New at Carne
gie Mellon sessions.
Students are selected to be 
Ambassadors by the Special 
Events department and the cur
rent Ambassadors. We are look
ing for leadership qualities, com
munication skills and a general 
knowledge of the campus, com
mented Lane.
Once the Ambassadors are se
lected they must undergo a one 
day training session where they 
are familiarized with student, 
administrative and general cam
pus issues. Lane explained, This 
year, various vice presidents will 
be speaking and on the agenda 
right now is university relations 
issues, development in alumni 
relations, Capital Campaign is
sues, the whole master plan proj
ect, a communications workshop
and the rules and bylaws of the 
program.
Recently, the new Ambassadors 
for 1990 have been chosen. They 
are: freshmen Julie Yan-Chin Liu, 
Stephanie Riso, Heather Th
ompson, Michael Colaianne, Steve 
Johnson, Brent Jones, Con
stantine Papageorgiou; sopho

At IBM, I was the only woman in my department. I thought it might be the 
same at Microsoft. I should have known that, like everything else  juggling in 
the halls, wearing shorts to work, singing in the lab, choosing your own hours  
Microsoft succeeds at being different. What impresses me most is the fact that I 
work alongside some of the brightest people in my field and Im learning new 
things everyday.
Alice Seubert 
Software Design Engineer, Systems 
CMU, BS Applied Math ICS 89
Interning at Microsoft was great because the level of work here is so high. 
They give you real responsibilities; I ended up having two programs I wrote added 
into the OS/2 package. While I did work a lot, I wasnt overmanaged. Hours were 
flexible, my manager was great and the environment was very pleasant.
Terence Spies 
Software Design Intern, Systems 
CMU, Logic Comp 91
Program Management is at the center of all the action  decisions are made, 
issues are discussed, and the ideas are pounded into designs. You are smack dab in 
the center of a team of very smart people  and they can be very tough customers. 
On a given day, I talk to an incredibly varied array of people  from writers to 
developers, testers to marketers, upper management to end users, and everyone has 
an opinion. Its my job to mold the opinions, tradeoffs and ideas into a product.
Pamela Ottaviano 
Program Manager, Applications 
CMU, BS Information & Decision Systems 88
Why did I come to work for Microsoft? The atmosphere here is very casual, 
not unlike that at college. Some of my friends made the mistake of not coming to 
Microsoft now they wear ties; I wear shorts. Microsoft: Its better than a real job.

Risorgimento!
doIo,Co vHN, u1mTo RE nRIAH,v mA Ano bomNh M,AI bm11
By MICHELLE JONES
Tartan Staffwriter
Okay, what big event comes to CMU 
that isnt Carnival, Buggy, or an AB 
dance. Give up? Then maybe you forgot 
about the Beaux Arts Ball.
Oh yeah, now you remember. But 
wasnt that cancelled last year? Well, 
yes it was cancelled, but nobody said 
anything about this year. And believe 
me, this years Ball is going to make up 
for last years bust.
And, for the first time ever, not being 
affiliated with CFA is no longer a valid 
excuse for not being able to go  now 
CFA students can purchase an unlim
ited number of tickets. In other words, 
all you have to do is ask, beg, or bribe 
someone in CFA to get tickets for you.
The 1990 version of CFAs signature 
bash is scheduled for Saturday, Febru
ary 10, less than three weeks away.
You may remember the problems 
and eventual cancellation of the 1989 
Ball. The troubled legacy is one reason 
this years Ball is so important. In 
addition to marking the Balls come
back, this will be the first time in 
recent history that the Ball is officially 
a dry affair. For this reason, planners 
refer to this years Ball as a fresh start. 
This [Ball] will set a standard, rea
sons sophomore art major Lizzie Mogel, who is also a decorations commit
tee member.
Speaking of the decorations commit
tee, it has a monumental task ahead. 
Inherent in the Balls varied history is 
the camouflage applied to CFA itself. 
Every attempt is made to render the 
building not merely unrecognizable, 
but fanciful, breathtaking, and even 
exotic. Risorgimento (the theme for 
this years Ball, which means a rea
wakening in Italian) designers have 
the added goal of stimulating the 
exhilaration that might have been 
generated by inebriated imaginations.
Mogel, junior Hope Johnson, and so
phomore art major Andy Voght have 
been working on designs since last Oc
tober. The ball is seven hours [long], 
says Johnson. People have got to have 
something to look at for seven hours.
After months of brainstorming, up
dating, and evaluating, the committee 
has developed final plans for CFAs 
transformation. Though the decora
tions wont physically represent the 
theme, they will create an atmosphere 
in keeping with the ideas expressed by 
risorgimento.
While specifics are to be experienced 
rather than read about, here are a few 
materials that will be incorporated 
into the transformation. There has 
been mention of trees, huge trees of 
at least 15 feet, as well as tumbling 
Christmas trees. It remains to be seen 
what can be done to stairwells, but 
rest assured those in CFA will be 
draped, disguised, adorned and practi
cally redirected. One stairwell will 
feature a suspended cloth sculpture of 
sorts which will fill much of its space.
The third floor of the building, the 
visual art floor, will receive the most 
complete treatment. The two design 
rooms will be turned into a, well, lets 
just say that finding your way out of 
the rooms wont be as easy as finding 
your way in. Other plans include a 
giant spider web and an over-sized 
version of a popular board-game.
The architecture floor (the second 
floor) will be reserved primarily for 
food, which will be served on the 
landings, with music performed on 
various interesting instruments. Food 
will also be served on the basement 
levels of the main stairwells and the 
mezzanine. The Balls grand scale 
requires the intervention of caterers so 
the food should be as satisfying as the 
decorations, and at 3 am the feel of 
the food will change from finger food 
to food more suitable for breakfast, cul
minating with a breakfast buffet.
Of course, what would a Beaux Arts 
Ball be without entertainment? Dont 
worry, attendees can expect to see en
tertainment from almost every corner 
of the building. When the doors open 
at 10 pm, strains of classical music will 
drift through the main foyer. This 
beautiful, elegant music will be per
formed by a brass quintet situated 
beneath the Deans office.
After this dignified start, a D.J. will
take over until bands take the major 
stage. However, the stage will not be 
that of the Alumni Concert Hall, but 
instead a real concert stage, complete 
with scaffolding. Royal Crescent Mob 
and Volcano Suns will perform on this 
stage, constructed over the main glass 
entrance way. Throughout the evening, 
there will be seventeen bands perform
ing in all, including familiar acts such 
as the Shift, the Heavy Cats, ATS, 
Special Ed., and the Voices United 
Gospel Choir.
All the entertainment will not be 
musical. A number of circus perform
ers will be on hand in the main hall to 
eat fire, juggle sickles, read palms, and 
create sculptures out of inflated 
balloons. One performer will be tap

Glory is destined to become a classic
By WASEEM HUSSAIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Every once in a while a movie 
comes along that leaves you think
ing about itdays after youve seen 
it. Glory is such a movie. In the 
relatively short span oftwo hours, 
the movie succeeds in not only 
painting a vivid world, but more 
importantly, in giving life to a 
wide array of multidimensional 
characters.
Perhaps the greatest strength 
of the movie is its ability to flesh 
out interesting, original concepts 
that are rarely presentedin other 
movies of this genre. In the film, 
the Confederate soldiers of the 
South are presented as faceless, 
dimensionless hordes firing their 
rifles. This creative sacrifice is 
not made in vain, for by doing so 
the movie concentrates on the 
central characters and develops 
disturbing issues such as corrup
tion and prejudice among those in 
the Union armies.
Glory is filled with startling 
images. It begins with Matthew 
Broderick walking as Colonel 
Robert Shaw in the fields of Antietam in almost a dream-like, sur
realistic state, as the men of the 
Union army are falling left and 
right at a frightening pace. It is a 
haunting, harsh image which es
tablishes Broderick as a truly vul
nerable character.
Broderick is nicked by a bullet 
and falls unconscious. When he 
awakes, his first sight is that of a

? **/2GLORY. (R) A beautifully made film based on the real life of Col. 
Robert Gould Shaw, the young officer who took command of the 54th 
Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first black fighting 
unit to be raised in the North during the Civil War. Starring Matthe 
Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman, ft

grave digger, played by Morgan 
Freeman walking in the fields of 
Antietam, wading through a sea 
of dead bodies. Freemans poise 
and presence on the screen gar
ner him immediate respect.
Eventually Broderick returns 
home, where he is commended as 
a hero of Antietam and is thrust 
into the position of establishing 
and leading the first black regi
ment of the Union Army. He has 
fears about leading such a regi
ment, not because he doubts his 
mission, but because he doubts 
his ability to lead. As the 54th 
regiment develops under his 
command, Brodericks character 
also develops as he becomes more 
confident and sure of himself.
One of the more interesting 
subplots in the movie is the developmentof Andrew Braugher, who 
plays the role of one of Brodericks 
best childhood friends, Sir Searles. Braughers character is the 
first one to volunteer for the 54th 
regiment when it is announced 
that a regiment of black soldiers 
will be formed under Brodericks 
command. The situation is unique 
because Braughers character is 
black, which creates a situation
in which Broderick must com
mand his best friend, and above 
all, treat him as any Colonel 
would treat a foot soldier.
Because of the pressure Broilerick puts on himself to live up to 
his high expectations, he become! 
a harsh, stoic leader. Brodericks 
close friend and confidant Major 
Cabot Forbes (played by CarJ 
Elwes) serves as an invaluablt 
foil to Brodericks coldness, art! 
helps Broderick maintain some 
semblance ofhumanity in frontcf

Paralleling Brodericks devel

character, Trip, one of the most 
fascinating of those presented # 
the movie. Washington describes 
him as raw and rough ... he's*

Roger & Me takes a humorous look at the death of a town
By TODD VANDERHEYDEN
Special to The Tartan
Watching documentaries about 
economically depressed towns and 
cities is usually about as much 
fun as walking around with oat
meal coating the inside of my shirt. 
If Im lucky I watch it with a 
Reagan Republican so I can make 
him wrong for what happened 
(Look at that, Mr. Thousand 
Points of Light). So its quite a 
treat to find a documentary both 
funny and satisfyingly biting.
Roger & Me chronicles producer/ 
director/writer Michael Moores 
attempts to contact General 
Motors chairman Roger Smith, 
against the backdrop of Flint, 
Michigan. After GM closed it Flint 
plants and moved its operations 
to Mexico, 35,000 people were left 
out of work, and the town was 
thrown into depression.
In between episodes of the Roger 
quest, Moore tells what happened 
and why. Among the residents he 
interviews are a woman who, after 
being laid off, now sell rabbits for 
pets or meat, and a deputy shergymcNE "EcNE,

producer/writer Michael Moore goes

Michigan after the General Motors 
plant closings. At Squirrel Hill.
iff with a very steady job  evic
tions. Contrast this with scenes 
of a party where the unemployed 
are hired to be human manne
quins, and a party to celebrate 
the,opening of the new jail, com
plete with mug shots, Jailhouse 
Rock, and playing with the riot 
gear. One alternates between 
this is tragic and this is so ri
diculous its funny.
Equally ridiculous are the celeb 
interviews  Bob Eubanks, An
ita Bryant, Miss Michiganthat 
show the tawdry, plastic nature 
of the put on a happy face crowd. 
A lot of the celebrity footage is 
shot from a television screen, 
making for a stale glitz effect.
The real star, however, is Moore. 
He is straightforward, doesnt hit
below the belt, and isnt afraid to 
look silly. Hes no Geraldo  his 
unassuming manner lets the 
events and people speak for them
selves. His narration is funny 
without having an accusatory or 
self-righteous spin. Hes like 
Roger Ebert with a sense of 
humor, or a pre-curmudgeon Andy 
Rooney. If the hicks on The New 
Bob Newhart Show were in 
Mensa, theyd make a film like 
this.
This film, financed partly by 
money from bingo games and 
Moores life savings, is a great 
tribute to hardworking people 
who say what they mean and 
mean what they say. It is also a 
slam to those who wrap them
selves in the flag when it suits 
their pocketbook.
This film is about a devastated 
town, yet one doesnt leave the 
theatre feeling dumped on. This 
film makes a difference. Roger & 
Me will be truly satisfying to 
anyone who has ever wanted to 
catch the doublespeakers and 
glad-handers with their pants 
down.
A little bit of India right next 
door in the heart of Oakland
By RAJESH V. PUTCHA
Tartan Staffwriter
As you enter the Star of India 
the atmosphere really stirs your 
desire to eat traditional Indian 
food. The soft Indian music hum
ming in the background smoothly 
feels its way into your conversa
tion. The glass top tables enhance 
lighting effects with their subtle 
glare. Mirrored walls add depth 
to the restaurant, making it ap
pear much larger than it really is. 
Beautiful Indian paintings also 
add a nice flavor to the restau
rant. In fact, everything from the 
.cushioned chairs to the ceiling 
fans, makes a trip there comfort
able. Next come the dishes themselves.
All of the dishes I have tried at 
Star of India have been truly 
mouth-watering, or should I say 
.eye-watering, due to the exces
sive hotness or spice one can chose. 
There are essentially three levels 
of spice you can order: normal, 
spicy, and super spicy. If you want 
;to be a true Indian and leave the
restaurant in tears, I recommend 
you try super spicy. It takes the 
food to another level in taste.
Probably the most popular dish 
is Chicken Tikka Masala, chunks 
of red-clay chicken seeped in a 
delicious tomato sauce with 
sprinkles of spice. From the very 
first taste, you will undoubtedly 
be enraptured by this delicacy. 
Chicken Tikka Masala is not the 
only enticing meat, for there is a 
variety of main courses to choose 
from ranging from shrimp to fish.
Next, a bread is of good choice 
and can consist of garlic, onion, 
plain nan, or poori, the traditional 
south Indian bread. All meals 
come served with a dish of rice. To 
wash down the meal, a glass of

All-star cast leads Cat on A Hot Tin Roof

Starting today you have the chance 
to see a major Broadway production 
right here in Pittsburgh. Our own 
city is one of just four locations cho
sen to host the pre-Broadway tour of 
Tennessee Williams Cat On. A Hot 
Tin Roof, the Pulitzer Prize winning 
play scheduled to open in New York 
on March 14.
Kathleen Turner, probably best 
known for her starring role as author 
Joan Wilder in Romancing The Stone, 
heads this all-star cast, portraying 
the fiery Maggie. Maggie is married 
to the gorgeous alcoholic Brick (Daniel 
Hugh Kelly), who lives in the shadow 
of his former career of professional 
football. Their already-rocky mar
riage is further aggravated by Bricks 
brother Gooper (Ray Gill) and his 
wife Mae (Debra Jo Rupp). As the 
parents of six children, this couple 
cant help pointing out that Maggie
has not yet had a single child. The 
two spend much of their time eaves
dropping on conversations between 
Maggie and Brick and reporting back 
to Bricks father, Big Daddy.
Charles Durning, whose film cred
its range from The Muppet Movie to 
Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, plays 
the tycoon Big Daddy, who has re
cently been diagnosed with cancer. 
With the threat of death upon him he 
must decide which of his sons will 
control his estate. He must also en
dure the attentions of his overly af
fectionate wife, Big Mama (Polly 
Holiday), and six mischievous grand
children.
Daniel Hugh Kelly comes to the 
Benedum directly from Broadway. 
He appeared with Edward Asner and 
Madeline Kahn in the revival of the 
comedy Born Yesterday. His screen 
appearances include Someone To 
Watch Over Me and Cujo.
Polly Holiday has received five 
Emmy nominations and two Golden 
Globe Awards for her work as Flo on 
the television sitcom Alice. She just 
finished a six-month stint as Amanda 
in another Williams masterpiece, The 
Glass Menagerie.
A cast like this could probably make 
any play look good. However, they 
have the added benefit of working
with one of the best scripts ever writ
ten. The late Tennessee Williams first 
gained national acclaim in 1945 with 
his poetic work The Glass Menagerie. 
His play A Streetcar Named Desire 
launched the movie career of Marlon 
Brando, while his other pieces have 
featured such superstars as Paul 
Newman, Bette Davis and Geraldine 
Page.
Cat On A Hot Tin Roof is considered 
a particularly outstanding achieve
ment by Williams because the action 
of the play is continuous; the second 
act begins right where the first left off. 
Cat was an instant success when it 
first opened in 1955 starring Ben 
Gazzara as Brick and Burl Ives as Big 
Daddy. The revival will run at the 
Benedum until February 4.
Tickets to this show have been sell

L12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  23 January 1990
Follow the tale of Henry, the gentle serial killer
I was figuring the other day 
that, in my personal lifetime, Ive 
probly witnessed 157,000 mur
ders by at least 15,000 frothmouth maniacs. (Im not count
ing my immediate family. This is 
stuff in the movies.) And I have 
never, ever, in my life, seen a 
mass-murdering maniac as scary 
as the one in Henry: Portrait of a 
Serial Killer.
Unfortunately for you, youll 
probly never get to see Henry, 
because the MPAA Jack Valenti 
Honor Society Censorship Board 
out in El Lay gave the movie an X. 
It didnt get an X for violence. It 
didnt get an X for sex. It didnt 
get an X for language or nudity or 
transvestites hacking each others 
heads off. Nope. The seven mem
bers of the Censorship Board gave 
it aiiX for disturbing moral tone.
Which is about like saying, We 
dont know exactly why we hate it 
so much. We just hate it.
And so that means that most 
theaters in America wont show 
it. Even though its been to film 
festivals, and even though the 
distributors have been trying to 
get it shown for three years, and 
even though the acting by Mi
chael Rooker as Henry is so good 
that hes now a highly-paid Holly
wood supporting actor, its got 
that disturbing moral tone X 
rating, which means newspapers 
wont take the advertising, thea
ters wont book it, blah blah blah.
The guy that made it is a direc
tor in Chicago named John McNaughton, and he made a big 
mistake when he filmed this baby. 
He based it on real life. He showed 
a serial killer getting away with 
it. No Charles Bronson guy out 
there dedicated to hunting him 
down. No sneer on his lips, indi
cating to us that, yes, this guy is 
one mean dude. Henry looks like 
... well, hes the kind of guy that
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE-IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
you cant really remember what 
he looks like. Drives a beatup 
green sedan. Favors a ratty-looking windbreaker. Fairly cleancut. 
Very polite. Soft-spoken. Gentle. 
And he calmly explains one day, 
to his best friend Otis, that the 
way you avoid getting caught is 
you never kill the same way twice. 
One day you use a gun, the next 
day a lead pipe. Sometimes you 
chop up the body, sometimes you 
dont. But you never, ever do the 
same thing twice. And you dont 
kill people you know or youve 
ever been seen with. Once you 
know this, youre home free.
But he doesnt stop there. This 
movie gets so far inside the head 
of Henry, the gentle serial killer, 
that you start to understand just 
exactly what it is that makes 
Henry kill. You know just exactly 
when hell need to kill again, 
whats likely to make him mad... 
and so, of course, were getting 
into more of your disturbing 
moral tone here. Elliott Ness 
never shows up. Henry never 
botches a job, because he always 
strikes unexpectedly. And, after 
hes killed somebody, it only takes 
him about ten seconds to figure 
out what his next step is. Pack the 
body in a suitcase? Nope, better 
use Hefty bags on this one. No, 
wait. Better cut his head off first. 
The cops have never seen that 
one before.
A long time ago, Henry killed 
his mama. He cant remember 
exactly how he killed her. It might 
have been with a baseball bat or a 
knife or a gun. Henry doesnt 
remember details like that any
more. All he knows is he killed 
her, because she used to force him 
to watch her have sex with strange 
men, or force him to dress up like 
a girl while she had sex. And so 
one day he ended up in prison 
where he made friends with a guy 
named Otis, small-time drug 
dealer whos philosophy of life is 
You want another beer?
So Otis and Henry end up get
ting a place together on the South 
Side of Chicago, and then Otiss 
sister Becky the topless dancer 
comes to live with em for a while, 
and eventually Henry trains Otis 
to enjoy murder as much as he 
does, and they get em a camcor
der to enhance the experience. 
Were getting way beyond kinky 
here. Were getting into the mind 
of Ted Bundy, and its so real, and 
its so logical, that... well ... the 
problem with coming down on this 
movie for a disturbing moral 
tone is that its also a truthful 
tone.
The guy that put up the money 
for the movie, Waleed B. Ali, said 
it this way. What I want to know 
is how in Indiana Jones and the 
Temple of Doom a man sticks his 
hand into the chest cavity of 
another man and pulls out a bleed
ing, beating heart and the movie 
gets a PG rating. And our movie, 
which has nothing like that, gets 
anX?
The MPAA refused to comment, 
but I think we all know the an
swer:
Drive-in Discrimination. Pure 
and simple.
If you know any movie theater 
people, put the heavy pressure on 
em to show this sucker.

Simple thoughts on common things
gfmm5 "EcNE,
ALL I REALLY NEED TO KNOW I 
LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN. By
Robert Fulghum, Ivy Books, 196 pages, 
$5.95.
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Managing Editor
Every now and then we all have little 
epiphanies, small insights into the way 
the world works. Most are simple little 
platitudes, at the cognitive level of Life 
sucks and then you die. Sometimes, 
however, we have such incredible reali
zations that we feel we should write 
them down and give them to friends.
Well, there are people who do write 
their little epiphanies down. People like 
Robert Fulghum, self-described philoso
pher and author of the runaway bestseller 
All I Really Need To Know I Learned In 
Kindergarten, actually take the time to 
write down these little thoughts.
Fulghum actually went so far as to 
publish a collection of these short inspi
rational pieces. This is annoying to the 
rest of us who have similar collections 
and dream of publication, because now 
its been done already.
Not only has Fulghum written the sort 
of book that everyone, at one time, has 
considered writing, hes done so with a 
good deal of style. Fulghum, who has 
worked as a cowboy, a folksinger, a com
puter salesman, a parish minister, and a 
bartender (among other things), has a 
wonderful feel for todays kindler and 
gentler America, where his book is sell
ing so well.
Probably everyone has heard his intro
ductory essay, whence comes the title of 
the book. He recounts, as a reminder to 
those who might have forgotten, how 
everything that one needs to know to get 
along in the world may be found in the 
credo of Kindergarten:
Share everything. Play fair. Dont hit 
people. Put things back where you found 
them. Clean up your own mess. Dont
take things that 
arent yours. Say 
youre sorry when 
you hurt somebody.
Wash your hands 
before you eat.
Flush. Warm cook
ies and cold milk are 
good for you. Live a 
balanced life  
learn some and 
think some and 
draw and paint and 
sing and dance and 
play and work ev
ery day some. Take 
a nap every after
noon. When you go 
out into the world, 
watch out for traf
fic, hold hands and 
stick together. Be 
aware of wonder.
So it sounds trite.
So what. What 
Fulghum (who re
sembles a preppy 
Kenny Rogers) does 
in AH I Really Need 
To Know... is fasci
nating. He provides 
a couple dozen short 
pieces, each withits 
own moral or lesson 
or peaceful thought; 
quick, easy reading that makes you feel 
warm inside. Its Philosophy Lite, with a 
thirdless unpleasantness than your regu
lar brand.
Fulghums book will not necessarily 
make you a better person, or a happier 
one, but his vignettes of ordinary life 
(washing clothes, tendingthe lawn, play
ing with children, cleaning the house) 
have a hook to them. The knee-jerk re
sponse is Yeah! Thats righU Thats ex
actly right! His optimisim is infectious, 
and he always comes across as a wise 
uncle, a gentle clergyman, an underap
preciated comedian who keeps on going 
even though nobodys getting the joke. 
Whatever hes got, its working; All I

Kindergarten held the catbird seat on 
the hardcover and paperback besteller 
lists for months, and Fulghums followup 
volume, It Was On Fire When I Lay Down 
On It, is doing comparably well in 
hardcover.
To farther add to Fulghums credibil
ity, he was first author in history to hold 
both the number one and the number 
two spot in the nonfiction category in the 
New York Times bestseller list.
Fulghums book is one evenings read

you for a while. You might want to do 
what I did  when you finish reading it, 
give your copy to a friend.
An excerpt from S88 L "EI884 &EEa Hm _em,CCC
Giants, wizards, and dwarfs was the game to play.
Being left in charge of about eighty children seven to ten years 
old, while their parents were off doing parenty things, I mustered 
my troops in the church social hall and explained the game. Its a 
large-scale version of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and involves 
some intellectual decision making. But the real purpose of the 
game is to make a lot of noise and run around chasing people until 
nobody knows which side you are on or who won.
Organizing a roomful ofwired-upgradeschoolers into two teams, 
explaining the rudiments of the game, achieving consensus on 
group identity  all this is no mean accomplishment, but we did 
it with a right good will and were ready to go.
The excitement of the chase had reached a critical mass. I yelled 
out: You have to decide now which you are  a GIANT, a 
WIZARD, or a DWARF!"
While the groups huddled in frenzied, whispered consultation, a 
tug came at my pants leg. A small child stands there looking up, 
and asks in a small, concerned voice, Where do the Mermaids 
stand?
A long pause. A very long pause. Where do the Mermaids 
stand? says I.
Yes. You see, I am a Mermaid.
There are no such things as Mermaids.
Oh, yes, I am one!
She did not relate to being a Giant, a Wizard, or a Dwarf. She 
knew her category. Mermaid. And was not about to leave the game 
and go over and stand against the wall where a loser would stand. 
She intended to participate, wherever Mermaids fit into the 
scheme of things. Without giving up dignity or identity. She took 
it for granted that there was a place for Mermaids and that I would 
know just where.
Well, where DO the Mermaids stand? All the Mermaidsall 
those who are different, who do not fit the norm and who do not 
accept the available boxes and pigeonholes?
Answer that question and you can build a school, a nation, or a 
world on it.
What was my answer at the moment? Every once in a while I say 
the right thing. The Mermaid stands right here by the King of the,. 
Sea! says I. (Yes, right here by the Kings Fool, I thought tomyselfj
So we stood there hand in hand, reviewing the troops of Wizards 
and Giants and Dwarfs as they roiled by in wild disarray.
It is not true, by the way, that mermaids do not exist. I know at 
least one personally. I have held her hand.

February Jazz promises top-notch performances
As we enter into a new semestr Im sure the question that 
esides foremost in your minds is 
feres the jazz? Fortunately, 
(ext Big Thing Productions has 
;ven us an answer with Febru,0 Jazz at Graffiti. Although this 
erjes is brief, consisting of but 
.oshows, the shows themselves 
11 be shining examples of the 
jnge of jazz.
On Thursday, February 8, the 
itst of the performances will be 
jven by West Coast keyboardist 
lavidBenoit. On the leading edge 
[the pop-jazz scene, Benoit has 
! rcent years made a name for 
mself as one of the best of the
ACCENT ON JAZZ
by Jeff Muller
Los Angeles jazzers (others being 
guitarists Larry Carlton and Lee 
Ritenour and saxophonist Kenny 
G). His stylistic synthesis of pop 
and jazz has caused him to re
ceive some critical flack, but nev
ertheless he continues to find
popular approval.
His latest album on GRP, Ur
ban Daydreams, is a harmoni
cally sophisticated showcase for 
his keyboard style. Although his 
compositions use synthesizers 
and other electronic instruments 
as coloristic devices, he has re
mained true to the grand piano as 
his primary keyboard. In this way, 
he follows in the footsteps of the of 
his influences, Bill Evans and 
McCoyTyner. But he has learned 
from these musicians without 
copying their style.
Speaking of Tyner, the jazz 
great will performing the second 
show of the Graffiti series on
Thursday, February 15. Probably 
the most influential jazz pianist 
of the past 25 years, Tyner is one 
of the few modern musicians who 
has created a sound that is 
uniquely his own.
Although he is best known for 
his work as a part of the inspira
tional John Coltrane Quartet of 
the early sixties, Tyner has over 
twenty years ofbrilliant solo work 
to his credit, as well as sOme fruit
ful associations with such pio
neers as bassist Ron Carter and 
drummer Elvin Jones. His solo 
music has often followed in the 
same directions as the music he 
helped to pioneer with saxophon
ist Coltrane  it combines all of 
the worlds music with jazz to 
create something completely new. 
Not only has Tyner borrowed 
African rhythms or Japanese 
scales in his compositions, but he 
has also employed instruments 
as diverse as the Japanese koto 
and the American dulcimer on 
his recordings.
Tyners performance is one 
which should definitely not be 
missed, because he is always on 
the cutting edge of acoustic jazz. 
The creativity of his ideas and the 
emotionality of his playing will 
make this one performance you 
will remember for years to come.
Benoit should also put on a won
derful show, and if you enjoy 
contemporary jazz try your best 
to get out to see him. Both shows 
will start at 8 pm.
Tickets for Benoit are $ 12.75 in 
advance, while Tyner tickets are 
$15.50. If you would like to see 
both shows, you can get a special 
jazz package price of $25.
Tickets are available at all 
National Record Marts, Oasis, 
Kaufmanns,Record Village, TIX, 
and the Graffiti box office. You 
can also charge the tickets over

Of all the characters in this rich 
lm, Morgan Freemans is the 
lost mature. He is the teacher, 
ie role model, and a father fig:e. Even though his character 
mains static, he is mstrumen1 in developing Brodericks and 
'ashingtons characters.
Besides character development, 
film excels in the choreogra
phy: The fight scenes will have 
jumping every time a bulletis 
ed or a bayonet is drawn.
The plot of Glory is not complex, 
lilt it is strong and does well to 
Id the movie up to its tragic 
iimax. Even though Broderick 
perns abitmiscast as the Colonel 
f the 54th and the cinematograhyis rather bland at times, the 
trength of the characters and 
he panorama of emotions that 
Ilory conjures in the viewer make 
liia film an instant classic.

Outside staff will also be hired 
to serve as ticket-takers and hat 
checkers. Not only is this an ex
cellent way to gain admittance to 
the Ball, it also pays minimum 
wage. It even solves the costume 
problem  a mask will be pro
vided.
With all the emphasis on cele
bration, costumes, and decora
tions, other aspects of the Ball are 
overshadowed. For example, a 
percentage of money from ticket 
sales goes to The Whales Tale, a
non-profit organization which is 
dedicated to addressing the prob
lems associated with drug and 
alcohol abuse, abused and ne
glected youth, runaways, and 
many other family crises. Any 
money over cost will also be do
nated to the center, according to 
Schroeder.
Now if you still havent gotten 
your ticket, whats it going to take? 
In addition to Carnival and Buggy, 
the 1990 Beaux Arts Ball will be 
one of the most talked-about 
events of our CMU career. Miss
this and youll have to lie at all 
subsequent reunions. Not a pleas
ant thought, is it?
Risorgimento committees need 
people to work on lighting, set up, 
sound, masks, practically all 
aspects of the Ball. If you don't 
want to contribute your labor and 
creativity you can still get involved. 
The decorations committee is re
questing donations of anything 
interesting or unwanted. They 
suggest bolts of cloth, stuffed ani
mals, Barbie dolls or anything 
else. To volunteer services or stuff

Thursday, January 25Catch-22
Set on a small island off the coast of World War II 
Italy, this movie depicts the exploits of the bombar
dier Yossarian as he wades through a war populated 
with eccentrically incompetent officers and depraved 
soldiers. To its credit, the movie does capture the dis
joint chronological style of the novel, but gone is the 
maddening sense of atmospheric contradiction that 
served as the basis of its dark humor  and its philo
sophical essence. The acting is somewhat dry, and 
many details will be lost to those moviegoers unfamil
iar with the book. Still, it has some entertainment 
value, and the major themes are still there, if some
what muffled. Its worth the dollar, but, like Cliff 
Notes, isnt a substitute for the real thing.

Raiders of the Lost Ark
A scraggly, leather-clad, bullwhip-flailing archaeologist-cum-adventurer races across the world to beat 
Nazi forces to a lost religious artifact that could 
dramatically alter the fate of mankind. Apparently, 
director Steven Spielberg and writer/producer George 
Lucas did some historic restoration of their own, 
because twenty years ago such a plotline would have 
been dismissed as 1940s serial tripe. But the twin 
Masters of Moviekind successfully filtered the cliches 
from the once-common rugged adventurer archetype, 
gave it a transfusion of imagination and eerie special 
effects, and produced a masterpiece of action, excite
ment, and wry humor. Harrison Ford plays the nowlegendary Indiana Jones, who cunningly outwits 
jungle savages, snakes, competitors, and most of the 
Third Reich as he tries to prevent the biblical equiva
lent of the Death Star from falling into the wrong 
hands. The movie is fast-paced, cleverly laid out, and 
great fun. See it one more time, just for old times 
sake.

Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade
Having already taken on two of the worlds major 
religions, our favorite hero goes on to demolish Chris
tianity in this triumphant conclusion to the Indiana 
Jones trilogy. This time Indy is seeking nothing less 
than the Holy Grail, and he has more than killer 
rabbits to contend with! The standard allotment of 
.cliffhangers and fast-paced chase scenes is still there, 
and some of the familiar faces from the first movie are 
dragged out of the closet as well. The special treat .is 
the introduction of Indys well-meaning but bumbling 
and detached father, excellently portrayed by Sean 
Connery. Freud fans can have a field day analyzing 
the amusing dynamics between father and son, which 
only ebb during a few occasional token gobs of senti
mentality. Nearly as intense as the first movie, Indy 
III falls short only in the somewhat lethargic sound
track and muddy, inconclusive ending. Nonetheless, 
its an effective and entertaining finale to one of the 
greatest movie series of all time. Go for it, ace.

Sunday, January 28A Shot In The Dark
In the Valhalla of comic movie actors stands a 
small, proud breed of individuals who manage to 
invoke waves of convulsive laughter in their audi
ences without resorting to excessive vulgarity or 
mundane anecdotes. And amongst these valiant tick
lers of the diaphragm stands Peter Sellers, who res
urrected the seemingly paradoxical art of elegant 
slapstick in his infamous Pink Panther Movies, the 
second of which, A Shot In the Dark, is purportedly 
the best. In this gem, the hapless inspector Clouseau 
must clear a woman of homicide charges, despite 
overwhelming evidence pointing to her guilt. Relent
less and mercilessly funny, A Shot in the Dark is 
perhaps the greatest justification of the immortality 
of the Pink Panther movies one could want. So surren
der your dollar, sit back, and let a master of humor 
make you forget that you have classes tomorrow.
