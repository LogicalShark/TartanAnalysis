Scotch n Soda to Hold 
First Bacchanalian Ball
0 The Scotch n Soda Club will hold its first annual Bac
chanalian Ball on December 3, 1960. This is the first of many 
social events to be planned this year, climaxed by the pro
duction of ANIMATION in May.
The Bacchanalian Ball, an idea*----------------------
Student-F acuity 
Discussions Will 
Begin Thursday
By Phil James
Thursday afternoon, at 3:30. the 
first in the series of student-faculty discussions will take place. 
These teas, which are sponsored 
by Omicron Delta Kappa with the 
assistance of the other class honoraries, have been inaugurated in 
an attempt to bridge the lack of 
communication and understanding 
which seems to exist between the 
faculty and students.
Whereas in the classroom and 
in other campus activities, con
tact between faculty and students 
is fairly well restricted in topic 
and is limited by a formal atmo
sphere, in these new events there 
is no restriction on subject and 
the atmosphere will be that of a 
relaxed bull session over coffee 
The administration and ODK 
hope that the teas will not only 
aid in increasing the mutual un
derstanding between the two 
groups, but will also give stu
dents an opportunity of discussing 
contemporary problems with oth
er interested students and fac
ulty.
The teas will take place in the 
end of Skibo nearest the stadium^ 
Coffee and doughnuts will be 
served free. If the first discussion 
fulfills the expectations of the 
sponsors, the teas should become 
a permanent part of the educa
tional program at Tech.

My cousin Herkie Nylet is a sturdy lad of nineteen summers 
who has, we all believed until recently, a lively intelligence and 
an assured future. Herkies father, Walter 0. Nylet, is as every
one knows, president of the First National Artificial Cherry 
Company, worlds largest maker of artificial cherries for ladies 
hats. Uncle Walter had great plans for Herkie. Last year he 
sent Herkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences, 
and Artificial Cherries, and he intended, upon Herkies gradu
ation, to find him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as 
a full partner.
Could a young man have more pleasing prospects? Of course 
not. But a couple of months ago, to everyones consternation, 
Herkie announced that he was not going into the artificial cherry 
business. Nor was he going to stay in college. I am, said 
Herkie, a member of the Beat Generation. I am going to San 
Francisco and grow a beard.
Well sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when 
Herkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would 
have gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately 
he was right in the middle of the artificial cherry season. Aunt 
Thelma couldnt go either because of her old leg trouble. (One 
of her legs is older than the other.)
my dear Watson! From the happy look 
on your physiog, from the cheerful lift 
you seem to be enjoying, I deduce 
you are imbibing Coca-Cola. No mystery 
about why Coke is the worlds favorite 
... such taste, such sparkle! Yes, my 
favorite case is always a case of Coke!
BE REALLY REFRESHED
So I went. I searched San Francisco for weeks before I found 
Herkie living under the counter of a Pronto Pup stand. Herkie, 
how are you? I cried, looking distraughtly upon his tangled 
beard, his corduroy jacket, his stricken eyes.
Beat, said Herkie.
I offered him a Marlboro and felt instantly better when he 
took it because when one smokes Marlboros, one cannot be too 
far removed from the world. One still has, so to speak, a hold 
on the finer things of life-like good tobacco, like easy-drawing 
filtration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoy
ing a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basi
cally happiness-oriented, fulfillment-directed, pleasure-prone.
Herkie, what are you doing with yourself? I asked.
I am finding myself, he replied. I am writing a novel in 
the sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a fugue for 
clavier and police whistle. I am sculpting in experimeiital ma
terialslike English muffins.
And what do you do for fun? I asked.
Come, he said and took me to a dank little night club 
where men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange 
crates and drank espresso. On a tiny stage stood a poet reciting 
a free-form work of his own composition entitled 1anO5EMe The 
Story of a Boy while behind him a jazz trio played 200 choruses 
of Tin Roof Blues.
Herkie, said I, come home with me to the artificial cherries.
No, said Herkie, so sadly I went home to tell Uncle Walter 
the bad news. He was less distressed than I had feared. It seems 
Uncle Walter has another son, a quiet boy named Edvorts, about 
whom he had completely forgotten, and today Edvorts is in 
business with TJncle Walter and Herkie is beat in San Francisco, 
and everyone is happy.ClMOMuMmH

On the Election
Question: What are your thoughts on the election?
ViiaJ 3Tie Junior, Chem., I 
hope that the combination of the 
close margin by which Senator 
Kennedy was elected and the in
creased strength of the Conserva
tive Bloc in the Senate, will re
veal to Senator Kennedy that 
while many of us desire his 
leadership in foreign affairs, we 
are not in favor of increased so
cialism in the Governments do
mestic sphere.
Fred Eversley, Sophomore, E.E., 
I was glad to see Kennedy elect
ed the next President of the Unit
ed States. While I dont believe 
either Nixon or Kennedy is 
worthy of the position, Kennedy 
is certainly the most desirable of 
the two.
#aJ1 kmwwe Sophomore, Chem., 
The significance of this election 
lies mainly in the fact that it 
shows our electoral system of 
choosing a president should be 
changed. This election was very

history that the American voters 
chose one man and the electoral 
college chose another. Obviously, 
this is not consistent with our 
American ideal of democracy. 
Peggie Greiner, Sophomore, 
Home Ec., Having worked for 
Citizens for Nixon and Lodge and 
being quite familiar with the plat
forms of both parties, I can only 
wonder at the choice which the 
American people have made. 
Jean Youngstrom, Senior, Cloth
ing and Textiles, Believing in 
unity, I must force .nyself to 
agree with the great majority of 
my fellow Americans, bpDPfk 
that I should support a strong 
central government, that I must 
be more altruistic toward the lazy 
free-loaders who want something 
for nothing, that it really isnt 
important for ME to spend MY 
money when the Government 
surely knows much better than I, 
what is good for me and what my 
personal interests are. I will even 
endeavor to see Mr. Kennedy as 
the gorgeous hunk of man that 
many winners are convinced he 
is and his wife, as the beautiful, 
intelligent paragon of a first lady 
who is only nin-i years older than 
us, gosh! Im hoping that Mr. 
Kennedy will alter his policies, 
realizing that 49.8% of the coun
try doesnt see eye to eye with 
him. Heres also hoping that ev
erything works out for the best, 
that Jackey-bird doesnt lose his 
temper in a critical situation and 
above all, that we of the 49.8% 
do not get the chance to say I told 
you so.

On August 12th, I960, JPL scientists at Goldstone,
California, radioed the worlds first transcontinental microwave message 
to bo relayed by a passive, artificial earth satellite. This satellite was the 
100 ft. plastic balloon Echo I orbiting around the Earth at an altitude of 1,000 miles. 
A pre-recorded statement by President Eisenhower was received 2,300 miles away 
by scientists of the Bell Telephone Laboratories at Holmdel, New Jersey, 
as clearly as any telephone call, in a fraction of a second.
Later in the course of the Echo experiment, the scientists at Goldstone and Holmdel 
conducted 2-wayvoice communication off the balloon satellite, 
Goldstone transmitting at 2,390 megacycles and Holmdel at 960 megacycles. 
This successful experiment opens up vast new fields of development 
for worldwide communication and is typical of many 
pioneering achievements of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

CURTAIN GOING UP!
By J. D. Sealiger
"I'm All Right, Jack"
Now playing up at the Squirrel Hill theater on Forward 
Avenue is the finest bit of filmed satire Ive seen in quite a 
while.
Im All Right, Jack is the latest in what I hope will 
become an even longer series of----------------------
comedies produced by the Boult
ing Brothers in England, and usu
ally starring such worthies as 
Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers. 
Whereas an earlier number The 
Man in the Cocked Hat raked the 
foibles of the British Foreign Of
fice, this latest takes a keen-edged 
knife to the even more deridable 
struggle between Big Business and 
Bigger Labor (or, for this pic
ture. Labour).
No Whitewash
One of the most pleasing things 
about the script is that none of the 
contestants escapes with anything 
like a coat of whitewash. On one 
hand, we have Big Business, with 
its Machiavellian doublecrosses, 
and millions changing hands. On 
the other hand, we have Big Labor 
with its eternal objective of the 
greatest amount of pay for the 
smallest amount of work. Both 
sides are lampooned with equal 
fervor and equally hilarious bits 
and plot complications, not the 
least of which the Terry-Thomas 
on the management side, and Peter 
Sellers representing labor.
Caught in the middle ol this is 
a classic character of British comic 
films, the rich-but-idealistic young 
knothead whose face almost al
ways manages to appear hand
some and silly at the same time. 
He is usually played by Ian Car
michael, and this picture is no ex
ception. His best scene is one 
near the beginning of the picture. 
I wont say anything about it ex
cept that it takes place in a candy 
factory, and will not only make 
you laugh, but will probably also
make you swear off candy bars 
for the rest of your life.
Bit Actors
There is just one sidelight. 1 
wonder if anyone can tell me why 
the bit players in American films 
always look like actors, whereas 
British bit-players always look 
like real people, and yet are five 
times as funny?
Im All Right, Jack, although 
it probably wont tell you any
thing about labor-management re
lations which is not already deductable from current headlines, 
is fine satire, whose direction and 
acting will provide you more than 
your time and moneys worth of 
humor and sheer delight.
Tech For Nixon
Although the presidential elec
tion is past news, the returns 
from the various states that must 
still count absentee ballots are 
still making headlines across the 
nation. As the CM5ME goes to 
press, the news is being broad
cast about Nixon receiving Hawiis three electoral votes by a 
margin of 96 popular votes. In 
light of this continued interest, 
the CM5ME here publishes the re
turns from our own campus elec
tion.
The Carnegie Tech students 
turned out in the largest number 
ever to vote in Richard Nixon 
for the next President of the 
United States.
The largest number of Carnegie 
students, 1290, or almost 40% of 
the student body, turned out to 
vote in a mock election held in 
the new Skibo. They cast 716 or 
56% of their vote for NixonLodge and 561 ; 43% for Ken
nedy-Johnson. Eric Haas who ran 
on the Socialist Labor ticket re
ceived 12 votes and Farrell Dobbs 
of the Workers Party got one.
The election was sponsored by 
the Government Clearing House 
who also sponsored mock elections 
at several other universities in 
Western Pennsylvania. The elec
tion at Carnegie was run by the 
Student Congress and the Amerf n;E5SEOo ;E sMYO 6]

Dear Sir:
I was one of the many hun
dreds of football fans who were 
on hand last Saturday afternoon 
on the occasion of the dedication 
of your new athletic field. I have 
several observations to make con
cerning this game which I trust 
you will find interesting.
To me, this was one of the 
finest football games I have ever 
witnessed from the standpoint of 
i ports mans hip. This fine attitude 
was evident in your coaching 
staff. your football team, and 
your student body. A mere look 
at the game statistics will bear 
this statement out when you real
ize that there were no major pen
alties of any kind. In this day 
and age, this is something in it
self. I realize that many major 
penalties are not premediated, but 
certainly some of them are. I also | 
thought that the officials did an 
outstanding job.
Your student body was cour
teous and did not exhibit the 
normal "booing that is so often 
found in many schools. I sat next 
to and in back of some students 
and I enjoyed discussing your 
school with them.
For personal reasons, I cannot 
say that I was disappointed with 
the final outcome of the game. I 
do however, trust that in years 
to come, your school, from top to 
bottom, will exhibit the same fine 
sportsmanship that they did last 
v turday. In years to come, the 
ore of the game will be forgot
ten. but I assure you that your 
sportsmanship will not.
Sincerely,
Craig W. Crowell

STUS EXPLAINING HOW MACHINES WILL 
SOME DAY OUTTALK" PEOPLE
Stu Smith graduated from Southern Cal 
with a powerful yen for excitement. His kind of 
excitementEngineering.
He got what he bargained for (and a little 
more) when he joined Pacific Telephone. One of 
Stus early assignments was to find out how 
existing Long Distance networks could be used 
to pipeline high, speed "conversations between 
computers in distant cities.
The fact that he did a fine job did not go 
unnoticed.
Today, four years after starting his tele
phone career, Senior Engineer Stuart Smith 
heads a staff of people responsible for telegraph 
and data transmission engineering in the huge
Los Angeles area. As a pioneer in this new data 
transmission field Stu predicts data processing 
machines will some day do more Long Distance 
talking than people.
Stu contacted 12 other companies before join
ing Pacific Telephone. 1 dont think theres any 
limit to where a man can go in the telephone 
business today. Of course, this isnt the place for 
a guy looking for a soft touch. A man gets all the 
opportunity he can handle right from the start. 
Hes limited only by how well and how fast he 
can cut it.

CALENDAR
The Pittsburgh Symphony Or
chestra will present another world 
premiere at its Friday and Sun
day afternoon concerts this week. 
The new work which will open 
the program was written by a San 
Francisco composer, David Sheinfield, and is called Etudes for 
Orchestra. It is a four movement 
piece which explores problems of 
rhythm, volume, and contrasts in 
music. Second on the program is 
the popular Symphonic Espagnole for violin and orchestra by 
Lalo. The violin soloist who is fea
tured in the work is Christian 
Ferras, a young French artist who 
has been winning prizes interna
tionally since he was sixteen. The 
concert will close with Schuberts 
Symphony No. 9. better known as 
The Great C-Major.
Another musical concert in 
Pittsburgh this week will be held 
at the Y.M. and W.H.A. Wednes
day night. Maria Luisa Faini, a 
young Italian pianist, will present 
a recital honoring Liszt, Chopin, 
and Schumanns anniversaries. 
She will play three sonatas by 
Scarlatti, the 1735 Piano Sonata 
by Ernest Beach, II Penseroso 
and Harmonies du Soir by Liszt, 
Schumann's Scenes of Child
hood and Chopins Sonata in f 
minor.
For those who like their music 
iu a more "folksy realm, the 
Weavers will present a conccrt at 
Carnegie Music Hall, Saturday, 
November 19 at 8:30. The title of 
their program, Folk Music Round 
the World, is indicative of the 
wide spread of this groups ma
terial.
However, if youd rather listen 
to singing instead of participating, 
the Pittsburgh Opera will prob
ably be of more interest to j^ou. 
Roberta Peters, coloratura of the 
Metropolitan will be featured in 
the November 2, and 23, presenta
tions Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor, also co-starring in the 
dramatic work are lyric tenor 
John Alexander and baritone 
Chester Ludzin.
Two live theater productions 
will be presented in Pittsburgh 
this week. The Drama Department 
of Carnegie Tech open its second 
Little Theater production Novem
ber 19. They have chosen 
Twelfth Night as their annual 
Shakespearian play for this year. 
Free tickets are available in the 
Drama Department office. The 
play will run through December 
8.
Five Finger Exercises con
tinue through Saturday night at 
the Nixon. Jessica Tandy and 
Roland Culver star in the John 
Gielgud production of this English 
play which has been awarded the 
Drama Critics Prize Play award of 
1960.
Students of Carnegie Tech are 
reminded that all of the great 
cultural events taking place in 
Oakland as well as on campus 
are available to them. Student 
tickets are available for the for
mer, where an ID card will give 
admission to the latter.
So there is a wide selection 
of attractions to ease you gently 
into a vacation spirit. Have a 
great Thanksgiving.

THE
GROUP
PICTURE
The purposes of the Cameron Choir are to provide all 
students of Carnegie Institute of Technology with the op
portunity to enjoy and participate in choral music, to rep
resent CIT musically both on and off campus and to create a
closer bond of fellowship between ? 
students from the different de
partments and colleges of the In
stitute.
In order to transfer the above 
statement from ink on paper to 
actual being, Techs choral group 
has a busy schedule. The sixty 
members, under the direction of 
Richard L. Camp, visit high 
schools in the Pittsburgh area. 
Last year the choir took a trip 
to New York city and performed 
twice. This year the group is 
again planning to travel, but the 
dest'ration is as yet unknown.
Being the choral group of Car
negie, Cameron choir also sings 
at school functions. Their first

At Carnegie, the poll takers 
were taken by surprise by the 
turnout. Ballots for 600 people 
were all that had been ordered, 
but by 11:00 the ballots had been 
used and the ballot box was stuff
ed full. Dr. Curry then printed 
ballots in Administration Hall 
and had them run over to Skibo 
in shifts.
Maybe by this turnout the often

students is showing itself.

Sigma Nu and Yulcans Enter Finals
Last night the Vulcans faced Sigma Nu in the Intramural football finals. Sigma Nu 
gained their booth in the finals by virtue of a 15-14 win over the Met Grads last Monday. 
The Vulcans defeated ATO 31-30 in Fridays replay of a tied game last Tuesday.
On Monday the Met Grads played ATO in the consolation game. This paper went to 
too early to have the re-#----------------------------------------------press
suits of the final and consolation 
games.
* 9 other semi-final play, Sig
ma Nu downed a Met Grad squad 
15-14. Bob Konuch sparked the 
Sigma Nu attack but may miss 
the final with the Vulcans because 
of an ear injury.
Last Tuesday ATO scored a 
last-minute touchdown to gain a 
tie with the Vulcans in the other 
semi-final.
In one of the most exciting 
games of the year, the Vulcans 
v n the replay 31-30.
ATO held a two-point advant
age at half time, 19-17. In the 
third quarter, however, the Vul
cans scored 7 points on two first 
downs and a brother-to-brother
pass from Gary to Lynn Adams, 
while ATO was scoreless. The 
fourth quarter saw more seoring 
by both teams and with two min
utes to play the Vulcans scored 
again to lead by 7 points, 31-24.
At this point the Vulcans show
ed that they play with brains as 
well as brawn. A1 Rolink kicked 
ofT very short to ATO, and the 
kick was retrieved into Vulcan 
territory. In a sixty-yard Field, 
this meant that ATO would not 
be able to Score two first downs 
before getting a touchdown. They 
did tally one first down, and then 
a touchdown on a run by Dave 
Grebos. The score came with 40 
i seconds remaining, and still left
the Vulcans with a 1-point lead.
ATO tried a onside kick in an 
attempt to get the ball. The kick 
splashed through the mud for ten 
yards, and in the pile of players 
diving for it, Lynn Adams recov
ered for the Vulcans. On the first 
play from scrimmage, Gary 
Adams ran up the middle for a 
big gain, then reversed his field 
and dodged his way back, where 
he was finally tabbed at the line 
of scrimmage as the game ended.

Techs cross-country team ended a highly successful seaf^n last Friday afternoon with a close victory in the West 
l^enn Conference meet at Grove City. The team took first, 
fourth, fifth, eighth, and twelfth places to edge Geneva by 
one point, 30-31. ?----------------------
Andy Niedra, the Tech fresh
man who is a resident of Beaver 
Falls, became the individual win
ner with a time of 24 minutes and 
30 seconds when Paul Sanders of 
Westminster fell down twice after 
opening up a big lead. Sanders 
had won the meet two years in a 
S w but only managed to finish 
seventh Friday.
Andy White and Jim Wilson of 
Geneva followed Niedra across 
the finish line. Then Mike Camp
bell, who showed improvement in 
every meet this year, pulled a big 
surprise by placing fourth ahead 
of Glenn Klepac. Techs captain 
was followed closely by Mel Vos 
of Geneva and Sanders.
Close Finish Decisive 
T Techs fourth and fifth runners,
Tom Bednarz and Ed Barvick, 
both won close battles in the last 
200 yards which decided the out
come of the meet. Bednarz edged 
Genevas captain, Ken Meeker, 
for eighth place while Barvick 
passed up Duquesnes Marty Katz 
with 50 yards to go for twelfth po
sition.
The meet \yas unusual in that 
ten out of the first twelve runners 
r^re from Tech or Geneva. Sand
ers was the only medal winner not 
representing either of these col
leges.
The victory was a sweet one for 
Coach Carl Olson, who vowed the 
team would win the conference 
championship at the start of the 
season. Assistant Coach Eric Ottervik and Manager Bob Revay 
also deserve much cerdit for the 
squads success.
This years dual meet record 
was a fine 7-3. Only a two-point 
loss to Geneva kept Tech from 
winning the conference dual meet 
championship.
Strong Team Next Year
A fine team can be expected

Titans Down Tech to Gain WPC Title
The Titans wrapped up their third consecutive West Penn Conference title last Sat
urday by storming over Carnegie Tech 46-20 at the Titans Memorial Field. The loss gave 
Tech a 3-2 conference record and an overall record of 3-5 for the season.
The Titans first touchdown came after Dale Stewart fumbled and Westminster recov
ered on the Tech 27. The ball was moved to the Tech 8 where Tech took over on downs. The 
Tartans were forced to punt on their fourth down and Westminster received the kick on 
Techs 34. In five plays Norm Bemiss carried for the T.D. The conversion failed.
Following the kickoff, Tech again was in similar situation. Bemiss scored again and 
Susi converted. For a third time*
the situation occurred. This time 
Susi carried for a T.D. The con
version failed.
After exchanging punts Tech 
took to the air as Bouxsein and 
Burrell teamed up to score a T.D. 
The conversion by Barrell was 
good.
Later Westminister intercepted 
one of Bouxseins passes. Knowles 
took a lateral from Ellis and took 
the pigskin over for the T.D. Susi 
converted and as the teams left 
the field it was 26-7, Westmini
ster.
In the second half Westmini
ster scored three times and Tech 
scored twice. Westminister coach 
Hal Burry substituted very freely 
in the fourth quarter and this 
seemed to account for the Tech 
T.D.s.

Tech just had trouble moving 
through the tough Westminster 
line and the Titans just kept run
ning through the Tech defense. 
Techs only prayer was the pass
ing of Bullet Bouxsein and the 
hard play of ends Marty Poad and

Double-Headers 
Planned
This year Carnegie Tech will 
play several basketball games at 
the Pitt Field House as half of 
double-headers. Either Pitt or Duquesne will play the other game. 
This will enable you to see sev
eral good outside teams, in addi
tion to our own games. This does 
not include the game on January
14, 1961, which is a benefit game 
for the Childrens Hospital, as in 
the past.
Carnegie Tech students will be 
admitted to the games upon pre
sentation of their I. D. Cards.
Other home games will be play
ed in our own gymnasium on the 
campus. We invite you to attend 
as many of our home basketball 
games as possible.
