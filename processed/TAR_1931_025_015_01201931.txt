ANNEX WINS
Skibos Top Western Re
serve Red Cats in Re
turn Engagement
SMITH HIGH SCORER
Presidents Offer Stubborn 
Resistance to Tartan 
Offenses
Carnegies floormen. continued on 
their triumphal march during the 
past week by unleashing a brilliant 
offense and defeating the Western 
Reserve Red Cats in a return en
gagement Wednesday evening, 37-16. 
The Reserves came to Pittsburgh, 
still -talking about their early season 
defeat {over Pitt, and anxious to 
avenge the trimming they had been 
dealt by the Tartans on their own 
floor.
Tartan Play Deceptive
The Skibos, primed for' the tilt, 
inaugurated a style of play with the 
opening whistle which apparently took 
the Clevelanders unaware and held 
them without scoring until after tht 
first thirteen minutes of play, ? in 
which time the Plaids had amassed 
a total of 17 points. During the en
tire first period, the Red Cats man
aged to sift through the ITogan of
fense for but five near shots at the 
basket, one of which dropped through 
from the opposing centers hands. 
The first half ended with the Carnegians leading by a wide margin, 
20-5.
During the second period the visi
tors were able to score eleven points 
against the Plaid defense, slackened 
..somewhat by the injection of sub
stitutes. The Carncgians, neverthe
less, managed to outplay the hard 
fighting Reserves and talliedseven
teen additional points.
Presidents Unyielding
The . Washingtonand Jefferson 
Presidents brought their mascot, the 
old jinx, with them for their en
counter with the Tartans Saturday 
night. The jinx, however, held little 
sway against the Hogan machine, 
which subjected the Presidents to 
:i 32-24 defeat. W. & Js. passing 
was extra good, and several times 
brought them within striking distance 
of the Carncgians by making seem
ingly impossible shots. The visitors 
were the first to score, but aside 
from the opening minutes of play, 
were never in the lead. Within 'five 
minutes, Captain Ncasc and his co
horts had . overcome the,  Wash-Jeff 
early spurt and had gained a five 
point advantage.
Hogan Changes Tactics
During the second period of . the 
entanglement, Coach Hogan decided 
to have liis men use a delayed of
fense which proved unsuccessful bccaUsc. of the ball being intercepted 
by the opposition. Nevertheless, the 
Plaids were able to maintain a seven 
point lead until the last few minutes 
of action when the Presidents re
duced it to five points. Stentz, how
ever, found the basket on a foul 
and a field goal just at the close 
of the game, and thereby boosted the 
margin to eight points.
Again Carnegies ability to make 
good on the free throws was a big 
aid in their success. The Skibos made
10 out of 16 attempts while W. & J. 
was credited with but 4 out of 14 
tries. Nease and Smith for Carnegie, 
and Johnson for W. & J. were the 
high point scorers, each accounting 
for three field goals.

CARNEGIE ARCHITECTS 
WIN FIRST MENTIONS
 A. F. Kuntz and C. F. Steiner, 
two Carnegie juniors, were award
ed first mentions in the Class B 
judgment of the Beaux Arts Insti
tute of Design in New York, held 
January 16. The subject of the 
cbmpetition was the design of a 
Meteorological Building of the coast 
of Maine in the path of leading air 
lines. The purpose of the building 
is to obtain data on flying condi
tions, principally weather.
In the Class A judgment in New 
York City on December 23, two 
Carnegie seniors, D. K. Ritchey and 
t. A. Stoody, were awarded medals. 
The problem was the design of a 
concert hall.
The competitions of the Beaux 
Arts Institute of Design are divided 
into two classes, Class A and Class
B. Class A judgments are for 
seniors and Class B judgments for 
juniors. All architectural students 
in the country are eligible to entei 
their work. The designs are judged 
by a jury of leading architects.
Carnegie Plays Pitt 
In Critical Match 
Tomorrow Evening
Tomorrow night Carnegie 
meets Pitt in the first of the 
inter-city championship tilts. The 
game will be in the Carnegie 
Gym. Starting with this game, 
all persons gaining admittance 
on students tickets must present 
both the ticket and book at the 
door. The students will also use 
the upper entrance at the Schcnley Park side , of the gym.
The preliminary game between 
the two freshman teams will 
start at 6:45 to be followed by 
the varsity game starting at 
about eight-thirty. Carnegie 
boasts a plcbe team this year 
that appears to surpass the stan
dard of any of its predecessors, 
and with the excellent showing 
of the varsity this year the stu
dent following will view this 
game with a most optimistic 
attitude.
COOKE REPORTS TO 
STUDENT COUNCIL 
ON CONFERENCE
Recommends That Carne
gie Join Student Coun
cil Federation
Joseph L. Cooke gave a report 
of the National Student Federation 
Congress held in Atlanta, Ga., at 
the Student Council meeting on 
Tuesday, January 13. Mr. Cooke 
was sent in the place of Marvin 
Fox, president of' Council, who was 
unable to attend the conference be
cause of the basketball schedule.
Tells of Events of Congress
Mr. Cookes report consisted of 
a brief history of the Federation 
and a summary of the events of 
the conference. Although not a 
mcpiber of the Congress, Mr. Cooke 
endeavored to learn by the aid of 
some of the members possible solu
tion to two of the main problems 
on the Carnegie campus-frcshman 
regulations and the Thistle. He 
reported that all the colleges and 
universities represented at the con
ference had difficulty in enforcing 
plcbe regulations. Also, Mr. Cooke 
found out that at the majority of 
schools either the entire student 
body or the whole senior class was 
assessed a certain amount for the 
year book. This amount-which en
abled the year book staffs to edit 
the books at a lower rate was paid 
at the beginning of each school 
year in the activities funds.
Recommends Joining Conpwcss
At the close of the report Mr. 
Cooke recommended that Student 
Council join the National Student 
Federation of America. No . deci
sion was made at this meeting.
Margu..et Sanger 
To L cture At 
Y.M.H.A. Today
Government Interference 
in Social Reform Is 
Subject
Margaret Sanger, internationally 
prominent birth control advocate, 
will lecture on "Government Inter
ference with Social Reform on 
Tuesday evening, January 20, at the 
Y. M. & W. H. A., Beilefield and 
Fifth avenues.
Mrs. Sangers work for birth con
trol began in 1914 after years of 
experience as a nurse in the hos
pitals and tenement districts of 
New York. In 1921, in New York 
City she organized the first Amer
ican Birth Control Conference, the 
first recognition of the birth con
trol movement by able scientists 
and responsible civic groups. After 
her election as president of the 
American Birth Control League she 
made a tour of the world. Many 
birth control leagues resulted from 
her lecturing. The scope of Mrs. 
Sangers endeavors are internation
al; her books have been translated 
into Japanese, Chinese, German, 
Polish, Lithuanian, Haitcan, Yid
dish, Hungarian, and Italian.
Up to the present her energies 
have been taken up with the or
ganizing, legislative and educational 
aspects of the birth control move
ment. She is still however prim
arily the scientist whose study of 
the causes of infant mortality led 
her into the path of social reform. 
She is now devoting herself to the 
study of the methods of reducing 
maternal mortality. As an expon
ent of birth control, she has had 
to contend with persecution, arrest, 
and calumny. Her unflinching vig
or and courage in warring ignor
ance and smug convention have 
won her the admiration of those 
who are not even in sympathy with 
her ideals.

This colored orchestra comes direct from the Hotel Savoy in New York 
City. It is composed of twelve pieces and plays music which . corre
sponds to the Don Bcstor style. This orchestra, although litle known 
in this district, is regarded by many people in the vEast as superior to 
Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club Band or McKcnnys Cotton 
Pickers. *.
Jan Garber, well known orchcstta leader, claims that this is 'the best 
colored orchestra in the country. Paul Specht also of National orches
tra fame, .says that he fcs never hejareb'its equal in a colored band.

MEXICAN ART AND 
ITS BACKGROUND IS 
LECTURE TOPIC
Count dHarnoncourt Gives 
Lectures on Mexico 
in Music Hall
Count Rene dHarnoncourt, now 
in charge of the Exhibition of Mex
ican Arts at Carnegie Institute, 
spoke at Carnegie Lecture Hall 
last evening on Mexican Art and 
Its Background.
This lecture was given in addi
tion to the informal gallery talks 
which Count dHarnoncourt has' 
been giving to clubs and special 
groups during the time of. the ex
hibition.
Count dHarnoncourt was sug
gested by Ambassador Dwight 
Morrow as the man best fitted to 
assist Homer Saint-Gaudcns, Direc
tor of Fine Arts at Carnegie Insti
tute, in assembling the show when 
Mr. Saint-Gaudcns went to Mexico 
last year for that purpose. Count 
d'Harnoncourt is fully conversant 
with all phases of Mexican art, and 
it is to his tireless efforts and ex
cellent judgment that the interest
ing and comprehensive character of 
the exhibition is due.
Kiltie Band to Play 
At Home Cage 
Games
The Kiltie Band has planned for 
the rest of the year the most am
bitious schedule of engagements at
tempted in recent years. Inaugu
rating a new policy, the band will 
play at all home basketball games 
tl is year. In recent years, the 
band has appeared at only the more 
important contests, but with the 
success, thus far, of this seasons 
quint, it was felt that the games 
would be made more attractive and 
colorful by the appearance of the 
band.
The annual East Liverpool, Ohio, 
trip which has been a feature of 
the tours of the past few years, 
but which was omitted last spring, 
will again be made. Several church 
engagements are in the offing, and 
as soon as final examinations arc 
over and the new semester has 
begun, the band will begin its 
scries of outside appearances.
The band is at7 work on several 
new compositions for the coming 
concerts and already has arranged 
Bridal Rose and several selections 
from Victor Herbert.
Need For Pugilists Arouses Hidden
Fighting Spirit In Student Body
The gentle sport of sparring has 
made its appearance on Carnegies 
campus, and about fifty-odd boys 
are fighting it out every afternoon 
in the gym. The school has not 
yet organized a representative team 
from the ones who are out for 
practices,- but it hopes to do so 
soon. And NEXT year, the man
agers hopefully informed us (oh, 
how they count on that next 3rear!) 
the team will have a real, attrac
tion to offer the lovers, of brutal 
battle, for the freshmen aspirants 
have the knack of occasionally 
knocking out a partner who doesnt 
get out of the way in time.
Everything is in the embryonic 
state except the enthusiasm mani
fested, and as yet there are no 
training tables. In fact there isnt 
a sign of food anywhere to greet 
the boys when they finish about 
7 oclock except a couple -of raw 
becksteaks that arc applied to the 
faceexternally, and whose" eating 
qualities cannot always be vouched 
for. Instead of cooks they have 
experts in the art of slinging a raw 
piece of meat about the swelling 
spot, and instead of the training 
table only whiffs of liniment filter 
up from down below.
No definite schedule of bouts has 
been arranged yet, although the 
boys met West Virginia last week. 
Their lack of practice distinctly 
hampered them and there i were a
I
few unexpected but none the less 
technical knock-outs in the tummy. 
The record crowd, which numbered 
about 8,000, was a fair indication 
of the popularity of the sport.
Carnegie has the good fortune 
to be under the supervision of a 
former Olympic champion, Coach 
Sesto, who sports a title equivalent 
to the worlds amateur champion
ship, and it is the only school in 
the Tri-State area (with the excep
tion of West Virginia University) 
that maintains a boxing team.. 
Those people who have vainly tried 
to count calorics and massage dou
ble chins and walk carefully so as 
not to wiggle too obviously will 
now be in their element, for the 
heavyweight class has no limits 
below 175, and the heavier the man 
the harder his punchor so goes 
the theory. Then the light-heavyweights come along, with a weight 
limit of 175 or better. The light
weight class has to weight only 
115 pounds, a fact which should 
draw many after the session of 
exams.
So far, no ladies have evinced 
a desire to learn how to spar, but 
we expect it any moment. The 
art of self-defense might be used to 
substantiate the umbrella advocated 
by one of the teachers in a recent 
lecture, and thus raise the sport 
from an athletic to a philanthropic 
activity.
Scribners Magazine 
Plans Contest For 
Writers
In a -contest which provides an 
opening for stories from unknown 
writers, Scribners Magazine in its 
February issue 'offers prizes of 
$1,000 and $500 for the best nar
ratives, 2,500 to 6,000 words, which 
are concerned with some phase of 
American life. All persons, regard
less of nationality or residence or 
previous literary experience, arc 
eligible for the contest, which 
closes June 20, 1931.
The amateur has his chance in 
this contest, the announcement 
states. It ! an attempt to bring 
new vigor and life into literature 
by reaching those people who arc 
living and creating America and not 
merely waiting about it. The nar
rators may be, says the statement, 
a worker in an oil field, a business 
man, a miner, a forsctranger, a 
stock broker, a housewife, a debu
tante, a politician, a resident of a 
deflated boom town, an applcgrower, a bootlegger, au actor, a 
farmer, a bishop, an office clerk or 
a longshoremananyone who has 
something significant to tell either 
about his own  life or life as he 
has observed it.
The manuscripts may be either 
narratives or articles or sketches. 
They will' be read as quickly as 
possible and all found suitable will 
be purchased outright and pub
lished. From these the prize win
ners will be selected. The purpose 
of the contest, states the announce
ment, is to break through the lit
erary shell and get to the real 
America. The editors are hopeful 
that the majority of the stories will 
come from non-professional sources, 
from individuals who are expressr 
ing for the first time their thoughts 
on paper and will, because of that, 
bring a strength and vitality and 
freshness of vision -often lacking 
in conventional writing.
As instances of the type of stories 
desired, Scribners points to the 
cow-boy tales of Will James, the 
Hunkie stories of Owen Francis 
and the Florida cracker stories of 
Marjorie Kinrian Rawlings. Each 
of these is said to be an accurate 
and interesting picture of life in a 
particular American setting.
Y.M. &W.H.A. To Give 
Dance For Students
The Y. M. & W. H. A. Student 
Council will sponsor a student

dent. At Carnegie, tickets may be 
obtained from Earl Klein, a senior 
in the College of Engineering.
GLAGOLiN DIRECTS 
RUSSIAN PLAY AT 
THE Y.M. AND W.H.A.
Carnegie Students to Ap
pear in Role of Im
portance
"Credentials, a play by Nicholas 
Erdman under the direction of 
Boris Glagolin will be the forth
coming production of the Y. M. S: 
W. IL A. Playhouse to be present
ed on Tuesday and Wednesday 
evenings, January 27 and 28.
Among the four Carnegie stu
dents who are in the cast are Helen 
Sisenwain, 33, who plays the role 
of a young Russian boy with politi
cal aspirations and romantic no
tions; Kathryn Dc Roy 33, is cast 
in the role of Nastia, a peasant 
maiden of royal mien who possesses 
a delicately romantic nature; Isabel 
Levin, 31, who portrays Anatoly, 
an eight year old boy, son of the 
general, Smctanich, played by Jac
ques Le Vine, Pitt "31; Miss Fran
ces Heckert, 31, is cast as a Rus
sian aristocrat. Others included in 
the cast arc: Milton Brauman as 
Ivan, suitor to Nastia, Lydia Pat
terson as the mother of Pavel, and 
his sister Varvara portrayed by 
Betty McDonald, well known for 
her impressionistic dancing, Louis 
Lowenstciri as Valerian, the Gen
erals son, and Harvey Efimove, 
iwhose characterization of Agafangel, the Generals aide, is doubly 
interesting because of his Russian 
nativity.
Credentials is a Russian satir
ical comedy based chiefly on the 
position of an old noble family that 
tries to be hypocritically loyal to 
the. new regime. Although a good 
deal of the humor is at th expense 
of the present Soviet government, 
it is such a playful humor that it 
was 'allowed to be presented in 
Russia under the direction of Mr. 
Glagolin. Credentials gives more 
the impression of being hilarious 
comedy than a political play. The' 
action takes place in Moscow and 
military men, peasants, proletarians, 
artistocrats, and "party men, are 
among the variety of characters 
responsible for many farcical and 
amusing situations.
Brois Glagolin, the director of 
Credentials was formerly director 
of the Russian Theater of the 
Revolution, with^ which organization 
he was connected for thirty years. 
During the last two years lie has 
been guest director at Carnegie 
where his most recent production 
has been La Princesse Lointaine.
Harvey Gaul, Pittsburgh music 
and dramatic critic, has written a 
musical composition in which the 
old Russian hymn is at war with 
the International. As a climax 
to the play this song will be sung 
by the Y. M. & W. H. A. Choral 
Society under the direction of Mr. 
Gaul. The Russian dances will be 
presented by Madame Susan Kar
pova, instructor of dancing at Car
negie. The settings will be constructivistic and will be directed by 
Frank Stout.
Subscriptions for the remaining 
three plays arc $1.50. Single ad
missions are 75 ccnts. Tickets may 
be secured at the Y. M. & W, H. A.
Ben Iden Payne To 
Direct The Charity 
That Began At Home
Ben Iden Payne, former head of 
the Drama department, who has 
visited Carnegie in the role of visit
ing director every year since his 
departure, is at present working 
with the department on a produc
tion of St. John Hankins The 
Charity That Began at Home. 
The play is a product of the Man
chester School of Playwrights of 
which Mr. Payne was the original 
director.
Mr. Payne produced Love's La
bors Lost* at Carnegie last year 
and has sincc presented the same 
play at the Universities of Wash
ington and Iowa. Mr. Payne is 
nationally recognized as an author
ity on Shakespeare and his annual 
visits to Carnegie were formerly 
marked by a production of this 
sort.

ALUMNI NEWS
Plaid Pugs Lose To M ' * In Opening Bouts
WESTERN RESERVE INVADED the Tartan battle
grounds with high hopes of revenging the defeat handed them 
on their own floor during the Plaids vacation tour. The Red 
Cats had passed their defeat on to the Pitt Panthers (who are supposed to be just a bit two fast for the Tartans according to 
the newspapers) and had been strengthened by the return of 
their center, Berwald, who was absent from 
the lineup in the first tangle with the Plaids. 
All in all, the Red Cats had worked up quite 
an appetite for the return game.
On the other hand, however, the Plaids had gained more experience in executing their 
offense and defense as mapped out for them 
by Coach Hogan, and had polished their teamwork. The Clevelanders put up a stubborn
__ game, and would probably have defeated, anyTartan team within the last three or four 
years, but they just werent a match for the perfected Plaids. It 
was no disgrace for them to lose again that night to the Tartans, even though the newspapers had no really good excuses to of
fer for the defeat.
* * * *
If WOULD BE A SOURCE OE SATISFACTION to any 
coach to see all of his men share in the scoring honors as the 
starting players did against Western Reserve. Carnegies firststringers accumulated a total of 37 points, consisting of 12 by
Smith, S by Captain Nease, 7 by Stentz, 5 by Colbart Fergus,
and 5 by Pee Wee (Leonards the name).
Such a distribution of points reveals that every man was 
alert and ready to pass the ball on to the teammate in the best : scoring position rather than to risk the possession of it by at
tempting a shot from a less advantageous spot.
3f< * ' *
IN CONTRAST, THE PLEBES showed a tendency to try 
wild shots, and play every man for himself. Their style was 
flashy in spurts, but in the long run Kiskis consistent style of play, although less impressive, won out.
* * * *
'FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1925, the Tartans have won four consecutive basketball games, and for only the sec
ond time in the history of the school, Carnegie has defeated the 
Wash-JefE cagers and their traditional mascot, the jinx. With
such a change in the tide of events already effected, it is notonly possible, but very probable, that this year's quintette will 
be remembered as the best ever to represent Carnegie. To say 
the least,i it is a rare treat to all to watch the Plaid combina
tion pje'HoVm.
FRESHMEN FLOORMEN

YEARLINGS, 47-17
>< * * *
OMORROW NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME in years, a Carnegie floortcam will go 
into a Pitt game on something like even terms 
with their time-honored rivals. If the Tartans 
come through, it will be the first victory the Skibos have scored over the Panthers in four 
years. Since the Plaids 26-24 win in 1027 the 
Blue and Gold five has chalked up eleven straight victories over our boys.
______________The fact that Pitt does not regard the Car
negie outfit as a set-up was made obvious by the antics of a 
certain spectator at the Western Reserve game last week who 
turned out to be none other than the firey-tempcred Doctor Carl
son from across the way. The manner in which the Tartan five disposed of the team that conquered Pitt seemed to make an 
impression on the Doctor who will, no doubt, have his team at the peak for tomorrow's encounter.
Coach Hogan will also have his quint primmed to the limit 
and the boys will be set to add the Pitt Panthers to their growing list of victims.

CARNEGIE'S INEXPERIENCED BOXING TEAM made a creditable showing against the veterans of West Virginia in their opening match Thursday evening despite the defeat
handed them. Fighting for the first time in 
intercollegiate competition, the majority of the 
mitmen appeared somewhat unsteady against the old-timers with the exception of Ducanis 
who fought his man to a draw. In the nexit 
bouts, which Manager Tauriello hopes to 
schedule with either Syracuse or Notre Dame, 
the Tartans will undoubtedly make an improved showing.
The team is captained by. Alex Ducanis and managed by Bill Tanriello, while Bill Cleindinst is managing the Plebe aspirants who will get under way in February.
* * * *
MR. IRWIN GEORGE JELLY JALONACK of Welch 
Hall has been elected to head the committee in charge of the 
annual Inter-Fraternity-Dormitory Basketball League.
This year, as has been the custom in the past, the teams 
will be divided into three leagues, the American, the Federal, and the National, with the Grand Champion being decided in 
a post-season playoff. The winner and runner up will play the 
Pitt leaders at the close of the season for trophies emblematic 
of the city intra-mural title. The contests will get under way shortly after the beginning of the second semester.
Down Morgantown way they 
take their boxing seriously, or at 
least that is what the turnout for 
the Carnegic-Mountainccr match 
would indicate. The crowd was 
estimated at about 5,000, an un
usual number for a college boxing 
meet.
After the last bout was over, it 
was found that the Tartans had 
been defeated 6V2 to '/>, but every 
one of the boys from the hilly 
district knew that he had been in
fight. The West Virginia squad, 
boasting two district champs in its 
personnel, is well known through
out this section, and strong oppo
sition from Carnegie's inexperi
enced crew was unexpected.
Eddie Ashe, hitting the scales at 
124, made his first venture into the 
ring, and caused his opponent much 
worry while the fight lasted. Eddie, 
evidently awed by the huge crowd 
and the novelty of fighting within 
the squared circle, started cautious
ly against Fisher until the two got 
into Fishers corner. Here there
was a furious exchange of jabs and
right hook to the heart sent
Ashe to the floor. Ashe -wisely 
took a count of nine before spring
ing up; he then tore at Fisher, 
swinging rights and lefts to all 
parts of Fishers anatomy. After 
an exchange in mid-ring, Eddie 
forccd Fisher to the ropes, but
made the mistake that cost him 
the match; stepping back to con
tinue the light, he dropped his 
guard -and Fisher smacked him 
with a stiff right to the bread 
basket, sending the Skibo fighter 
to the canvas again. Although 
Ashe was apparently not badly in
jured, the bout was stopped, be
cause of two knockdowns in one 
round being considered a technical 
knockout in intercollegiate boxing. 
Ashe conceded Fisher five pounds 
in weight, the Mountaineer boy 
weighing in at 129.
In the 135 pound  class, Affeltrangcr of Carnegie and Hesse 4 of 
West Virgingia put on a wow of 
a scrap. The going was fast and 
hard at all times, but Hesses 
speed, experience and reach en
able him to cop the decision.
The next bout brought together 
two tough welterweights, Carr from 
Carnegie and Stunkard of West 
Virginia. Carr dazzled the crowd 
with his snappy footwork, causing 
his opponent to miss frequent 
blows. Many thought that the 
Pittsburgh boy had won, but hard
er blows influenced the referee in 
giving I he decision to Stitnicard,
Latham, West Virginia district 
champ, found that he had encoun
tered a demon in Ralph Sewell', 
Carnegie middleweight. Sewell car
ried the fight to his opponent, but 
the bout had to be stopped when 
he rcinjurcd a nose that had been 
badly damaged in training several 
weeks ago. This fight was fast and 
furious, and it made a great hit 
with the fans.
Alex" Ducanis gave Karr a real 
working over, yet lie was awarded 
only a draw. Karr . carried the 
first round, Ducanis nabbed the 
second by a wide margin, and the 
final session was called even. Duke 
had an edge on the infighting, but 
Karr clinched his way out of trou
ble. Both these boys arc in the 
175 pound division.
In the heavy class, Toussaint
After a rather disappointing show
ing against Kiski Wednesday, the
Plcbcs came back Saturday night to 
down the W. & J. Freshman quiutett 
47-17. Both games were played 011
the Tartan court.
The discarding of the every man 
for himself style of play, which
caused the 27-24 defeat at the hands 
of Kiski, and the return of team work 
made it apparent from the outset that 
the Vice Presidents were in for a 
tough evening. Thd Plebes got off 
to an early lead and were never
threatened after the first quarter.
The game marked a decided im
provement in the play of the mem
bers of the squad. Using, the fast 
Hogan delayed offense, the Baby 
Tartans piled up. points .at will with 
Jagnaw the principle basket eager 
having a dozen two-pointers to his 
credit. Edclblut and Radabaugh both 
showed decided improvement over the 
brand of ball they played in the 
Kiski encounter while Silverman and 
Frccdcl continued to play consistant 
ball. Bobby was the lone bright light 
for the losers putting up a clever 
floor game and doing some mighty 
fancy shooting.
Now that the Plebes have learned 
that teamwork pays they should be 
headed toward a successful season. 
Tomorrow's contest with the Panther 
Cubs should be a hard fought con
test and will, in all probability, re
veal the Plcbcs true worth.

The Stcntz-Lconard-Mcrtcn trio makes things hum in the cage game 
at Carnegie. The three arc not seen in action together, however, be
cause of Stnetz and Merten, both playing the center position.-
The annual I. F. D. B. B. L. 
championship race will soon be un
derway, the entrance fee of twelve 
dollars being due by the twentieth of 
the month.
The schedules of die three leagues 
have not been announced as yet. but 
will be drawn up with numbers in 
the place of team names. Each rep
resentative will then draw a number 
and the games will be played ac
cordingly. This, method has been 
chosen in order to eliminate all 
favoritism and prejudices.
This years tournament promises to 
be as hotly contested as those of 
the past. If any team can be termed 
a favorite it is, the Beta Tlieta Pi 
outfit which came through last season, 
undefeated and who have the same 
line-up inlact for the coming season. 
The Phi Kappa and Beta Sigma Rho 
outfits, winners in their respective 
leagues last season, arc also looked 
upon as leading contenders. A num
ber of teams have been strengthened 
by new material and arc anxious to 
get a crack at the former leaders.

of Carnegie, willing but nncxpericnccd, was no match for Hawkins, 
golden glove champ from the 
Mountaineer school. Hawkins has 
a wide reputation in collcgiatc box
ing circles and Toussaint should be 
congratulated for putting up such 
a good fight against a reputed 
tough pug. The fight was stop
ped after about a minute of min
ing when it was seen that Hawk
ins was just too good.
Jimmy Bronson, second to Gene 
T unncy in all his major bouts,
refereed and made the. decisions..
The school band Was out, the offi
cials were outfitted in evening
elothes, and all in all it was a 
gala event in West Virginia ath
letic circles.
As time goes on the Plaid swim
mers arc becoming more skilled in 
the navigation of our gymnasium 
waterways and this arouses that 
debatable question whether the 
swimmer who makes the biggest 
splash has the best chance of 
winning the race, Assuming this 
tobe true, the Tartan tankers pos
sess a certain amount of potent re
sistance that must be overcome by 
any school of invading na.tators 
who expect to return with a Skibo 
scalp.
The practice meet of last Friday 
was held within the realms of ex
perimentation for the purpose of 
determining the strength of various 
combinations. The results were 
gratifying and -'the future looks 
none the worse. Edwards and 
Estabrookc arc 011 the inactive list 
just now, but they will resume 
their swimming duties shortly, 
when their ailments disappear.

fact that W. and J. and the Uni

present plans are carried out, 
Wooster .MU be added to the list of 
opponents.
The Plebe program has been 
completed through the efforts of 
Freshman Manager Charlie Fisher, 
and shows new opposition in the 
Academy High of Erie. Pitt Frosh,

toughest foes in line for the Skibo

WOMENS ATHLETICS
RIFLE
If the beginning of this season 
a good criterion of the future, 
a successful year can be expected 
for the Womens Rifle Team. Ap
proximately 25 freshmen and other 
beginners have come out regularly 
for. practices and have turned in 
some excellent scores.
A beginners match will be fired 
the week ending January 24. A 
cup will be awarded to the winner. 
This cup will be in permanent pos
session of the victor as a reward 
for her marksmanship.
Due to loss of time in starting 
practices, the intervention of final 
exams and changes of dates by 
other schools, varsity matches will 
not begin until the week ending 
February 21. Lousiana State Uni

be the first opponents of the Car

BASKETBALL
Basketball practices continue reg

Believe it or not, the time for the 
Semester Exams is here and how. I 
am -veil prepared to enter into the 
festivities of the occasion with my 
pen and (paper, but what the outcome 
will be, only the profs, know, I 
dont. Yes, I have been cramming 
the whole while  back, but I am no 
farther ahead than I was this time 
a year ago, except that it was then 
1930 and now it is 1931, which 
doesnt mean much.
Yes the Post-Holiday1 dance will 
take place on the 24th and I am 
sure to be there. I have been looking 
forward to this event for the past 
month or so, and at first I thought 
from indications that it would not 
happen, but leave it to the N. S., C. 
to arrange for an affair. They are 
always on the job even if they do 
have a "post Post-Iioliday Dance. 
I'll see you there.
Heres a good one from abroad, 
and I don't mean maybe. Indications 
from fashion plates aremen take 
noticethat in Berlin and other Ger
man cities, they;are taking to wear
ing fur-trimmed spats. Think of it, 
fur-trimmed. Now wouldnt that fur
nish an incentive for a plot for a 
play. And in' Germany, of all places, 
this seems to  be a very popular 
fashion. On the other hand in Eng
land, the spats are almost a thing 
of the past. The Prince of Wales, 
the standard of all mens wearing 
apparel, docs' not wear then, con 
sequcntly they arc tabooed. In their 
stcacl the cloth topped shoes are 
much in vogue. However, and be 
that as it may, yours truly is not 
much in favor of. spats, fur lined, 
trimmed, or whatever style you may 
choose to offer, but who cares.
That Christmas Recess Diary cer
tainly -was a chronological account 
of an eventfultime;.jnanight stu
dents, life. In soiiie' things my time 
almost paralleled1 those ' of' that night 
pludcnt whoever he -may;-be, and I 
don't envy hint. I thought I was the 
 only.; ono who didnt take life seri- ousljV: hut one - learns-- new things 
every day.  I am ' going tokeep a 
diary and  sometime 'later I Will let 
llie night students in on my secrets;
No, ajl the . chivalrous, men are 
not'dead yet . as you .will see from 
the following account which appeared 
in one of our papers recently. The 
incident happened 'liot/very long ago 
\n Chicago, and it makes mighty 
food reading. It appears that a con
ductor on one of the street car lines 
Aras. injured by being crushed . be
tween his car and an auto. The. 
news was flashed throughout the city 
irid immediately street car traffic in 
places was at a stand-still.- Motormcn 
from the district where the accident 
happened forgot their cars arid rushid to the aid of an injured com
rade. The injured man was taken 
to a hospital and his co-workers 
came in large numbers to his aid. 
One of the mans legs was severed 
arid the other was so badly crushed 
that it had to be amputated. A 
transfusion was necessary and a long 
line of men in uniform was waiting 
to undergo tests for the operation. 
Two were selected and each gave a 
pint of tJlood, but the operation was 
in vain and the conductor died a 
tew hours after the operation. If 
. ;his doesnt give a good indication 
ind, picture of loyalty, then I dont 
snow one when I see it. I take my 
hat off to those men of the Chicago 
street car lines whoever they may be 
for their wonderful spirit of chivalry 
and sacrifice. Such display of loyalty 
to a fellow-workcr and comrade is 
worthy of commendation and should 
b -a.n incentive for others to emulate.

OHIO RIVER BOULEVARD
Night students who are forced to 
travel toward the north boroughs 
after class will appreciate the new 
t)hio River Boulevard. Besides 
providing a fine, direct roadway to 
this section for those who are 
fortunate enough to possess cars, 
it also takes a great amount of 
traffic from the streets used by the 
street cars, thereby improving the 
running time of schedules.
It is worth the troubl to travel 
the length of this subjec -i tour 
of inspection. Bridges, cuts, fills, 
all are so numerous^and in such un
usual corners that a great deal 
can be learned from a study of 
, them. It must be goodnobody 
at least has termed it a blunder* 
yet.

flict with the basketball schedule, the 
Council agreed to postpone the dancc 
until this Saturday evening. .
Since the Council has been hold
ing their danccs in the gymnasium, 
they have become quite popular for' 
the added floorspace can accom
modate several hundred couples with
out crowding. The committees in 
charge of decorations have made the 
gym a more elaborate place with each 
succeeding dance. We thought that 
the ultimate in decorative beauty had 
been reached with the last dance, 
but according to Chairman Mauro of 
the social committee we aint seen 
nothing yet, meaning that, the com
ing affair is going to be one of sur
prises.  (There are about a dozen 
fellows who will understand this bet
ter after the dancc).
Tickets, for this dance have been 
on sale by students in various class
rooms and in the corridors. If you 
have not secured your ticket, there 
is still time or you may pay at the ' 
door; the price, $1.00 a couple. Bet
ter call the one and only so that 
the evening will be a complete suc
cess. Every thing to make the eve
ning enjoyable will be provided1, the 
only other necessity being the pres

The Plaid On Sports
Every so often the Plaid bursts 
out with an article on the * ath
letic activities of Carnegie. The 
night' students arc as much inter
ested in the welfare, of the teams 
representing our Alma Mater as 
the day students, who probably are 
well acquainted with the athletes, 
and read the reports of their activi
ties with a great deal of enthusi
asm.
The way Coach Hogan's baskctballcrs have been trouncing the 
opposition is reason for predicting 
that several night students will be 
cutting classes when the Skibos 
pfay in their own back yard this 
season. Basketball had about 
reached the lepths of despair with 
the student body when Hogan: 
landed in town last year. He im
mediately started his system work
ing and, although their record last 
year was not much to brag about, 
it was evident that better things 
were on the way. We are now in 
the midst of one of the most suc
cessful basketball seasons that Car
negie has enjoyed for , some time. 
The games with Pitt should be 
humdingers and it is our opin
ion that old Doc Carlson is going 
to need more than one Eddie 
Baker if he cxpccts to . stop the 
"combination now wearing the Skibo 
colors.
As for the boxing team, well wc 
cant say very much, as this branch 
of athletics is more or less of an 
experiment out here just now. 
With a good coach who can teach 
the art, Carnegie should have a 
better than average college team, 
for there seems to be plenty of 
material.
Another thing, now that boxing 
has a foothold here, I wonder if 
it might be possible for wrestling 
to get a toehold on Carnegie? This 
is a winter sport which is very 
popular with the Eastern colleges 
and attracts fairly large crowds. 
With several colleges close to 
Pittsburgh having wrestling teams, 
it might be. well for Carnegie to 
try it for a couple years. West 
Virginia, Western Reserve, Ohio 
State, Waynesburg, Penn State and 
many other colleges iri the -tri-state 
district have,teams.
Last  but notleast, we should 
'like to see a Carnegie 100-yard 
man beat the best that Pitt has to 
offer in that line.

WORKERS
All students who have been work
ing at the various Night Student 
functions are requested to be on hand 
at the gymnasium Saturday after
noon not later than four oclock to 
help dccoratc the gym for the Night 
Student Council Post-Holiday Dancc 
which will be held in the evening.
As there will be basketball games 
in the gym until four, it is not pos
sible to start decorations sooner and 
wc will be rushed for time so the 
more men who come out the easier 
the job will be. This notice also ap
plies to all committee members and 
the officers of the three colleges.
H. E. MAURO, 
Social Chairman.
For some time past the signs 
and posters which have been plac
ed on the Bulletin Boards an
nouncing functions of the Night 
Group have been thoughtlessly re
moved. Wc must admit that some 
of these signs arc works of art 
and'arc a temptation for some to 
possess them, but as wc depend 
upon this medium to announce the 
various functions and changes, the 
removing of them crcatcs a hard
ship to the night group.
Therefore, the Night Student 
Council1 would appreciate it if the 
signs and bulletins which arc plac
ed on the Bulletin Boards arc left 
there until after the function has 
taken place, then they may be re
moved. Thank you.
PAGING H.A.P.
TAKING THINGSALIEN BILLNIGHT FRATERNITIESAT LASTInevery
TOO SERIOUSLY
It is within the scopc of every
bodys experience that too much conccrn over any enterprise is likely to 
result in its ultimate failure. In our 
efforts to achieve a desired result 
we often make the mistake of word
ing to a point when wc  c no long
er cfficicnt. This last consideration 
is hardly ever so important as in 
night school work.
And yet, how many night students, 
especially' the ones new to require
ments of study at'Carnegie, have a 
proper outlook upon the great task \ 
they have set out to perform? I 
dare say, very few. For example, let 
us take the first or second year stu
dents in engineering. Do we find 
them in very great numbers at our 
smokers, danccs and other activities? 
No. Titey. do not attend them be
cause they think their time is so 
limited that there is none left for 
things other than work or study. 
Here is where they make an un
fortunate mistake. Those of us who 
have attended night classes for a 
period of years can readily under
stand and sympathize with these stu
dents, bccausc, although like them at 
first, wc cxpcricnccd a gradual 
changc which has shown school life 
in a different light. Wc too found 
our task of greater difficulty than 
we had ever known and consequently 
had to work much harder to succccd. 
All our time was spent j in' study or 
thinking about the apparent enormous 
assignments made by the instructors. 
Our life was simply just work and 
study.
But , as years passed, a gradual 
changc took place in our attitude to
wards life. We found that wc could 
attend a function here and there, it 
might liave been smoker, or a dance, 
but at all events wc found time for 
a little enjoyment. We had attained 
that great achievement which some 
few acquire 'in a short time which 
takes others' a lorigr tifrife to liccdmplishthe ability to do enormous
tasks and at the same time not al
low them to worry1 us nccdlessl)r. 
Such an outlook upon serious mat
ters is a great step towards succcss 
in life, and if wc acquire it by at
tending night school, even though it 
takes years, the accomplishment is 
well worth the effort involved.
And so, the writers message to 
younger students is this: do not
take your studies so seriously that
you get the worry perspective upon 
everything else. To some it may 
seem impossible not to worry over 
obstacles which lie in their path. 
However this complcx can be con
quered for the writer has ac
complished this feat during his six 
years in attcndancc at Carnegie.
A.J.II.
Tight times in the United States 
may bring independence to the Philip
pine Islands, after three dccadcs 
under the Stars and Stripes. Bills 
have been introduced in Congress 
discriminating against the Philippines 
in all sorts of ways. Some would 
shut out Philippine products on the 
ground that they coinpctc with Amer
ican products, while others would 
bar Philipinos from entering the 
States as "aliens.
This two faced attitude has 
brought a storm of criticism from 
Filipino leaders. As long as the 
islands remain under the American 
flag, Commissioner Guevara insists, 
Americans and Filipinos must share 
the same prosperity or misfortune.
Let us not forget, lie said, that 
the United States of its own voli
tion took on its obligations to the 
Filipino people and now, if living 
up to these obligations is going to 
be onerous, then it is up to the 
United States to rid itself of the 
duty.
There is no doubt that a queer 
situation is dcvclopirig in the House 
and Senate. Until recently, Congress 
has favored indefinite postponement 
of the issue, but now something has 
changcd their opinions., As. long as 
the burden promised to pay big divi
dends they were for it, but now that 
some details of the burden promise 
to become actually burdensome, thats 
different. McG.
FOREST CONSERVATION?
During the Christmas season a 
cry is heard that we arc devastat
ing our forests of trees in order 
to furnish the trade which is clam
oring for the ever popular and all 
important Christmas tree. The 
opponents of this activity claim 
that it is little short of criminal to 
destroy such a quantity of trees 
every year, and they arc clamoring 
for a law to stop the practicc.
On the other hand this activity 
gives employment to a large num
ber of men. In the Adirondack 
region, for instance, and this sec
tion of the country supplies a large 
territory, scorcs of men and boys 
engage in cutting, bunching, and 
hauling small evergreens for the 
Christmas season. Hundreds of 
trees arc carricd in freight cars 
and motor trucks to the urban 
ccntcrs, where they are sold. It 
is also pointed out 'hat a great 
part of these trees arc taken from 
placcs where they would never 
attain a growth sufficient to give 
them value as timber. It is claim
ed, too, that the type of tree is 
one which grows rapidly, so rap
idly, in fact, .that those cut cach 
year at this time arc hardly missed. 
And from an economic point, es
pecially in the season when these 
trees arc cut, Avorlc is so scarce 
that the employment afforded to 
those engaged in  the industry of 
cutting and hauling the trees more 
than offsets the little, if any dam
age which' may result. Lets have 
the trees cach year.
During the past'school year much 
has been heard about NU SiGMA 
ALPHA Fraternity and it is the 
pleasure of the Plaid to publish some 
information relative fraternities. There 
arc in general two classes of Fra
ternities, namely: Honorary and So
cial.
An Honorary Fraternity is organ
ized primarily to honor students who 
have been faithful in the work and 
field from which the honorary chooscs 
its members* It furnishes public 
recognition for meritorious work in 
its field, and only those students who 
qualify can be and arc callcd to its 
ranks. A standard in the particular 
field of activity is set up and a stu
dent to qualify must meet ccrtaiti re
quirements before lie can be pledged. 
It therefore follows that an incentive 
is established to which a student can 
aspire and to which lie may be callcd 
provided lie meets the requirements. 
In such a class is NU SIGMA 
ALPHA. A student who receives a 
call to this fraternity rcccivcs an 
honor bccausc only those students 
who have qualified can be callcd. 
Membership in this field is not limit
ed bccausc a student can rcccivc as 
many honors as lie is able to qualify 
for.
A Social Fraternity is not so classi
fied. There is no obligation on the 
part of the prospective member to 
take active part in any activity. All 
that is required is that lie meet the 
constitutional requirements of the 
particular organization which is usual 
ly only of a social nature. The names 
arc proposed by members and they 
rcccivc calls and it rests with the 
prospective members whether or not 
they choosc to affiliate themselves 
with the organization. There is a 
marked distinction however between 
the two types, arid that is a student 
is only permitted to belong to otic 
social fraternity and membership in 
any other social organization dis
qualifies him. On our campus wc hav< 
PHI NU Fraternity which operates 
under this rule. Students are tendered 
invitations to join and if they de
sire to join the organization, they ac
cept the bid and become members 
after they arc initiated into the or
ganization.
In a social fraternity the require
ments for membership arc not as 
rigid as that of an honorary fra
ternity.
After several thousand years of 
mental effort on the part of every 
mathematician who loved Math 
for Maths, sake, a method has 
been developed whereby any true 
arc can be trisectcd. In fact, the 
method permits any odd or even 
number of divisions (equal of 
course) to be made.
The solution to this perplexing 
problem was found by a ..an who 
retired from a profitable pursuit to 
seek out the key to tho ^igc old 
impossible ridd'.c, and after sev
eral years, his labors have been re
warded. While the complete 
description and discussion will not 
be given and until the theorem is 
copyrighted for the authors pro
tection, it has been hinted that a 
complete departure was made from 
all previous attempts, and that the 
square is used as the basis of opcra. ons.
The purposeful nian who so am
bitiously displayed the old spirit of 
the alchemist is to be congratulated 
for having added to our all too 
meager store of knowledge. If this 
formal prpof is acccptcd, fame will 
be his, and lie certainly deserves

shown than in the telephone business.
In accounting work for instance, an 
improved method that clips just one

one toll ticket would have great results.
Applied throughout the System-hand

Abusing a Privilege
The drama department has extended a special privilege to 
Carnegie students for1 a number of years with their special Fri
day afternoon matinees. These performances are certainly a 
convenience to the commuting student and to those who are 
unable to obtain tickets for the evening. They have always, .ip to this point, been well received, and it never could have 
occurred to anyone with an average sense of appreciation that 
:he time would come when abuse would be made of this priv
ilege.Last Friday afternoon one of the most artistic and note
worthy performances that the Little Theater has presented 'in some time was, offered to the students. It was one which by 
virtue of its theme should have been of particular interest to 
them. The reception given to it, however, would have been 
more appropriate for a burlesque show than for one of the high
est forms of the dramatic art.
Our definite feelings on the subject of independent criticism 
of the fine arts were not strong enough to prevent a blush for the minds of people who would receive such a splendid exhibi
tion with wise-cracks and cat-calls. One does not waste his 
breath reading Schopenhauer to morons. Another Friday after
noon audience like that and the drama students will stop wast
ing theirs. V
PLAY REVIEW
Two Cheeks To Slap cannot be 
adcquatly commented on in one re
view. There is the author to con
sider and there arc the actors. The 
latter deserve special and foremost 
mention, and it is the actors this 
article especially considers. Of course, 
in this, the author cannot - be en
tirely forgotten. As is just and in
evitable lie will receive mention now 
and then/ but it will be brief. The 
actors have the spotlight.
Leo Daschbach in the part of John, 
that unhappy creature damned to a 
hell on earth by his imaginative plans 
for the betterment of the human race, 
nt times transcended the play itself. 
In. those times when he didnt trans
cend it the play suffered, revealed, 
is it was, in all its lack of dramatic 
content. This is no using of strong 
words idly. Consider the play and 
:onsidcr the part. The play has no 
;onclusive story; it is an illustration 
)f a theme. Obviously, then, in such 
i play character is lost if an author 
is not careful, and this author was 
not careful. He was more interested 
in his preachment than in his charictcrs. As a result lie created in 
John a type, the ever-crucified Christtypfe who, instead of talking like an 
individual person, different from' any-- 
one else, talked like the author. He 
1 became the authors mouth-picce in 
place of a creature of flesh and 
blood, and thereby resolved into a 
bore. Mr. Daschbach, by his unbound
ed enthusiasm and vitality, kept John 
from being as much a bore as he 
was destined to be when he left the 
luthors pen. And this is remark
able, and to Mr. Daschbachs credit, 
when one considers the downright im
possible dialogue in which the char
acter w^s written, particularly in the 
second part.
Usually an intelligent actress, Miss 
Bauersmith in the part of Mary was 
plainly confused. She never knew 
whether to burlesque the part of 
Mary or to dramatize it. Her inde
cision was only natural. No such 
woman ever existed, or could be 
made credible. Despite her dilemma, 
Miss Bauersmith did with enthusiasm 
as she was directed and so vindicated 
herself. The best actress in the coun
try in the same part could do no 
better than that. Miss Bauersmith 
was second in the honors.
Glaycy Cooper was third. His
part was only a bit, but his acting, 
which came from within himself, was 
a distinct pleasurewhen he wasnt 
speaking the lines given him. When 
lie spoke lie was something, any
thing, else, but he wasnt a millboss. In one instance he did a very 
amateurish thing. When he was about 
to cross in front of Mr. Daschbach 
in the mill scene, he "telegraphed 
he  was going to cross, and then 
when he was half way across he let 
the audience know again tli^t he 
was going to step and deliver a 
parting shot before lie went off, and 
sure enough he did. This anticipation 
of movementsfor which lie was 
also guilty in "The Faithfulspoiled 
what otherwise would have been a 
nice little pjece of work.
As Pete, Mr. Thompson was bc1 icy cable until lie acted a drunk. To 
play an incbriant is not as easy as 
it first appears, and Mr. Thompson 
in such a part was pretty bad. His 
fault was over-acting to such an 
extreme that lie seemed to be 
emulating, not a drunk, but a man 
in the last stages of dbcomotor 
ataxia. Emotion seems always to run 
away with Mrk Thompson. If lie 
approached a part coldly, more in
tellectually, would his work, even 
now not to (be disregarded, be more 
definite?
In the part of the prostitute, Miss 
Kempton did not ring true. But, as 
in the case of Miss Bauersmith, she 
is not to blame In the past Miss 
Kempton has done some creditable 
acting, and it is not likely she would 
be baffled by such a broad type-part 
as Chloe. Here again, as nearly 
everywhere else, the play stumbles 
over bad dialogue. This prostitute 
does not talk like a prostitute^ but 
like someones idea of a prostitute 
gained from reading plays and books. 
The prostitutes vocabulary, it will be 
recalled, is always "round-about. She 
relies wholly on' the universal com
prehension behind Suggestion and 
Hintat least, until business is under
taken with which society has brand
ed her. Here, if ever, her words 
would he "round-about.
In a final estimate of the play, it 
appears poor dialogue is its greatest 
shortcoming. How can the figures in 
this play impress, or even interest 
mildly, when they dont talk like any(Continued in fifth column)
Howdy, You All!
If ypu will excuse us while we 
don the serious, we .would say that 
something of importance was over
looked in the rush of events after 
the holidays. The wife of one of 
our old standbys, Fritz Corshenliousen, passed away during the 
Christmas holidays. Fritz, one 
of the most conscientious helpers 
we have, has been .going about his 
landscaping of late with the usual 
greeting for all the students but 
without the old pep. At this time 
we would like to tell Fritz that 
the sympathyof the entire student 
body is. with him, and also their 
friendship.
More and more it is being im
pressed upon us, the students, that 
Carnegie really has a basketball 
team this year and not a repetition 
of the Windless Wonders or the 
Liberal Losers of past years. Cap
tain Spalding Nease and his 
hearties already have a better rec
ord than most Carnegie basketball 
teams of the past. If they beat 
Pitt tomorrow night, you may ex
pect Congressional Medals for the 
squad almost any time. Even if 
they dont win, they look good 
enough to lose about as many as 
the team of two years ago won, 
which was about three. Hogan 
must have the Indian sign on the 
boys.
From the size of the crowds at 
the home . games so' far, Buddy is 
going to need balconies or hanging 
baskets for the Pitt game. Dough 
Shekels seems to be the official an
nouncer for the gameSi from his 
scat high in the bleachers. Hes 
good but mixes his sports too 
often. Red Jones, as Chief Win
dow Opener, has a good sense of 
balance and fine persuasive powers, 
using the latter to get other peo
ple to open the windows for him. 
Leonard Schnuppe, Don Fletcher, 
Tony Schmitt, and 'some more of 
the schools Hired Help look good 
with the blue Usher ribbons, which 
some sweet young thing mistook 
for First Prize ribbons. She should 
have known better. The only 
time the ushers work is when some 
of the gifls (Kay Palen and Salome 
Wright) come in late so that they 
can parade past the stands.
Last week, we said Backgammon 
would be next after Checkers at 
Carnegi$, but were wrong. (What! 
Again?) The Architects, those fol
lowers of the unusual, have taken 
to Ping Pong and the time-hon
ored, hallowed sport called African 
Dominoes. "The Ping Pong cham
pionship ^is as yet undecided, due 
to the fact that all the balls arc 
lost, but Stoop>-and Schulman seem 
undisputed champions of the 
Knights of the Bended Knee. When 
new things are done, the Architects 
will do them.
-lie Seniors arc getting impatient 
for their L6ve Nests, (not candy). 
Joe Cooke and Bob Rinaker are 
hunting an apartment in preference 
to the Dclt house, Jerry Wise and 
Hats Levinson feel the same way 
about the Beta Sigma Rho house, 
while Johnny Sabol and Walter 
Loverihg already have t-hcir cute 
little flat not far from school. 
Somebodys going to mistake Johnny 
Sabols place for a hospital if lie 
takes many more nurses up there. 
All this might be expected in the 
Spring, but not so early.

Think It Over
After reading the article entitled 
'College Is Bad for Girls in the De
cember issue of College Humor-, :Our 
hope is that Nina Wilcox Putnam 
was in a satirical mood when she 
wrote it. But unfortunately it sounds 
surprisingly sincere. It seems in
credible that at this date higher edu
cation for women should be con
demned on the grounds that it is 
unfeminine and robs women of that 
particular charm which they should 
possess in order that they may be 
sought by the male element of the 
population.
Mrs. Putnams picture of a col
lege girl is truly ludicrous. I can 
spot a college woman as far as 1 
can see her. Her hair is seldom if 
ever quite right. Her clothes are 
practically always ladylike but never 
absolutely chic and charming. All 
too often they arc slightly too much 
tailored.
The girls who know the right 
tricks of make-up and costume 
usually get kicked out of college the 
first year just as they used to in 
the old daysj because charm has 
not as yet replaced virtue on the 
curriculum of the average .female 
college.
Its a fact,, says Mrs. Putnam, 
"that in my secret heart I feel col
lege docs to girls what brandy does 
to hard -sauce, it spoils the taste 
without adding a kick. She fails to 
realize, that although womans place 
may be in the home, her mental 
growth is not stunted by this fact. 
An intelligent girl has intellectual 
needs which must be met, and con
trary to Mrs. Putnams idea the ful
fillment of these needs through the 
medium of a college education docs 
not interfere with womans ultimate 
carreer of marriage and homcmaking.
Mrs. Putnam decries the inde
pendence of the college woman. 
Theres; often a smart-alec air about 
college women. They have something 
I havent got, thats true. Educa
tion. But I cant seem to find out what 
good it does them. Except, for the 
habit of somewhat standing on their 
own feet, I cannot see what they 
gain in comparison to what they lose 
by discarding their essential depend
ence, which is the basis of their 
charm. It is our belief that there 
arc quite a few men who find con
siderable attraction in the girl who 
has a few ideas of her own and the 
ability to carry them out. And these 
same men usually find, the helpless 
baby-doll rather annoying.
Mrs. Putnam is doubtless right in
Delta Epsilon for one evening 
Thursday night, and Pi Delta Ep
silon accomplished more than ever 
before .... The D. U.s tried too 
hard to get the house warm .for 
the meeting and fire trucks stopped 
the extra heat .... The Kappa Sigs 
threw their annual pledge party, and 
everything was fine, except that there 
were no cigars, and the dancer didnt 
come .... Good Morning, Boys 
. . . . Will Ware forgot all about 
the Eta Kappa Nu initiation in his 
excitement over the proper way to 
set table and the proper way to make 
the waitress .... The basketball 
dances are a tremendous success, 
theyre the darkest dances so jar 
. . . . Ruth Fackler, besides being 
very nice and a freshman P. and D., 
is writing a song .... The boys 
who hang around the Hut have 
been christened "Library Lizards

Regulating Your Expenses 
Making your spending 
money go as far as possible 
requires careful and sys
tematic budgeting. A bank 
account will help you regu
late your expenditures and 
prove an inducement to saving, thus laying the founda
tion for your future financial 
independence. The Mellon 
National Bank will be glad

make your acquaintance and

stressing culture as a most necessary 
attribute of a gentlcwomarf? And 
this she says, "is not the product 
of any university, but'the result of a 
gentle upbringing. She believes 
that college rather tends to. rob a 
girl of this quality. By the time a 
girl reaches college she is past an 
age at which the culture and train
ing which have become a part of 
her make-up are likely to be altered 
appreciably even by a powerful in
fluence. It seems-that the broadening 
effect of a college education would 
be more likely to . enhance culture 
than to lessen it.
The'thing which Mrs. Putnam secs 
as the greatest loss incurred through 
increased collcge attendance by wom
en is "the decay of the grande dame 
quality in our womcn-folk. She be
lieves that woman becomes a demo
crat and has too much of a sense of 
humor to assume the dignity of the 
society^ leader, and practice perfect 
manners and courtly behavior. She 
laments the passing of unadulterated 
high societyin favor of an intel
lectual aristocracy. The present gener
ation recognizes the fact that women 
have juSt as variable temperaments 
and interests as men, and that they 
arc no more adaptable to stereotyp
ing. , . _ *
In the beginning of her article 
Mrs. Putnam admitted that anything 
she said would be mainly for her 
own satisfaction as she seemed quite 
certain that by voicing her disap
proval she would not stop girls from, 
going to college. We heartily agree 
with the writer on this pomt. Wom
en will continue to go to college and 
will lead just as happy and normal 
lives as women did a generation ago. 
And they will continue to t attract 
men and lead domestic lives as satis
factorily as their forebears.

thing human! No man or woman anywhere . ever talked: as,, these puppets 
do, and while, it may be argued that 
drama is not, cannot be, a direct 
transcript of life, certain proprieties 
must be observed, and chief-among 
them is convincing speech. Let 
dialjguc be unconvincing, and char
acter suffers; and if character is not 
present in a serious drama, there is 
nothing leftnot even if your play 
in content be a record "hear.
The substance of "Two Cheeks 
To . Slap may go unquestioned. It 
is an interesting theme, and a 
stimulant to thought. It is. in the 
form, the manner of presentation, 
that the play buckles up and breaks a 
second time, though not with such 
dire results bad dialogue entailed. 
A well-rounded plot would have done 
much to make this play more stirring. 
It wuld have made for emphatic, as 
well as aesthetic, effect, and the final 
impressions on the spectators would 
have been deeper. As it is, a long at
tenuated series of scenes, it is as 
effective as the very best talkie 
ever manufacturedwhich is to say, 
it isn't effective at all, but is gone 
from ones consciousness very short
ly after leaving the theater.
Im fine, poor dialogue, badly drawn 
characters as a conscqucnce, and unemphatic dramatic form, spoil an 
other wise interesting thought.

FRATERNITY CONVENTIONS 
AND THE NATIONAL DEBT
In a communication to the press, 
Dr. John Stuart Thomson, sportsman, 
author, explorer (see Whos Who) 
asks the assistance of readers 'in his 
efforts to revive the chestnut tree 
(castansa Americana dentataAmeri
can sweet wild chestnut) now prac
tically extinct as the result of the 
blight (endothia parasitica) which 
attacked it 30 years ago.
Well be out four thousand bucks, 
the finance chairman told me con
fidentially, but it was a hell of a 
good convention, wasnt it!
Sure was, I replied,, oddly enough 
thinkingyof the. men who had shiver
ed* out on the corner in front of-the 
hotel selling apples. .
You. see, continued the chairman, 
we figured on 400 guests and only 
2S5 turned, up. .That cut our income 
by almost three thousand. And then 
more guys came from Western chap
ters tliair. we. figured oil and their 
railway fare sure runs ' into big 
dough.
"Yeah, I replied. "How about the 
favors?
Big loss, too, he commented. "We 
got over a hundred lying on our 
hands, and we had to pay three 
bucks for them even wholesale. -
The talk went on for some time. 
This was the last night1: of the four 
day convention and, we had some 
time. I had averaged three hours 
of .sleep a night not. counting tlic 
ten hour rail journey there. We had 
had a bar wide open' during the en
tire party, wide-open that is except 
for the first, night when they used 
up all the liquor they had figured 
to last four full days. There had 
been busjncss meetings scheduled for 
ten in the morning, which started -at 
2 in the afternoon.- 'ihc'rc had been 
a gala costume daiice coupled with 
highly, elaborate decorations; there 
had been a cabaret party, and a very 
formal dinner dance, and a stag 
banquet, punctuated with rah-rah 
speeches, and a theater party, and 
an awfully-expensive orchestra. There 
had been everything except....................
Well, I was our chapter delegate. 
I had.been sent-down by a*poverty 
stricken house - to get them spme 
money that they really needed. _ I 
cant go into details here but the 
financial prestige and future of my 
fratcr lodge;. were at stake. Did I 
get any money? Did I get even an 
offer of help? The nearest I came 
to either was winning twenty bucks 
from one of the national officers 
in a crap game up in one of the 
rooms at five, one very cold morn
ing*So right out here in cold type, I 
demand to knowWHY.
Why fraternity conventions? Why 
national fraternities?
Theyre surely not necessary for 
the running of a fraternity. All the 
business transacted at the convention 
was framed and passed on by the
Big Guns three months before the 
convention started. All we delegates 
did was to waste our time and watch 
them steam roller the stuff through. 
Later I, and two other men in com
mittee, in something like a half an 
hour, worked out the business of 
the fraternity for the coming year. 
Next December, theyll hold another 
orgy and steam roll our suggestions 
through.
Lord /knows, Im as cynical as 
they come, and fraternity ideals ct al 
are not only a lot of hut entirely 
BUNK. But when a national organ
ization is willing to go 4,000 dollars 
or more in the hole, and refuses 
to help one of its best chapters over 
a tough winter with a few hundred, 
I get sore and want to kno^v wKy.
Why these big glorious national 
officers, trapped in imitation ermine, 
with a pretty glass studded scepter, 
and a notion that because they arc 
the heads of some jerkwater fra
ternity they arc the rulers of the 
earth. How they strut around the 
hotel lobbies, with the fancy ribbons 
and buttons on. their lapels, for all 
the world thinking they arc as im
portant as theyd like to look.
WHY dont they get hep to them
selves? You can find better founded 
delusions of grandeur in any insane 
asylum!
