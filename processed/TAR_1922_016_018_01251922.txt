SPANISH NAME 
FOR ARTS BALL
Advance Bulletin Out This 
WeekCommittee is 
Completed
The name of the eighth Arts Ball 
lias been changed the Fiesta en 
Granadatihe .Spanish formula for 
the event. Tliie idea for this ball 
comes from tlie city of Granada when 
it was at its height in the commer
cial "world. Knifehts and gentlemen 
from the Spanish courts paid visits 
to the sovereigns of Granada and 
took part in their festivities; Italians 
from .Genoa and Florence and clthmalcers from Flanders had mercan
tile estabishments in the city; Eng
land and France had trade relations 
with the Moors, while the barbaric 
kingdoms of Africa sent envoys and 
merchants with their attendant trains 
of slaves.
The costume of any country of the 
15th century offers a great variety 
of choice. One of the most usually 
worn mens costumes of the time con
sisted of a short pleated blouse-like 
garment belted at the waist with wide 
sleeves;, close fitting leg coverings 
(tights) and long pointed shoes. Many 
other types of costume, however, 
were worn. Hats and caps were'of 
great variety.
Tliie lady of the 15th century wore 
long flowing robes which might be 
adorned with heraldic designs or the 
ibold pomegranate designs of the 
period. A surcoat or overgarment 
with wide sleeve openings, richly or
namented with fur and jewels was 
frequently worn over the robe. The 
headdress of the lady offered more 
variety than those of the men The 
liighi pointed steeple with its hanging 
veil and the gauzy butterfly were 
only a few.
Modern Spanish costume is not per
missible  toreadors, bandits, seori
tas, etc.
Those who saw Pierre Patel In in 
the Little Theater some time ago re
member the 15tli century costumes 
displayed.
A lecture on the costumes of the 
period will be given in the theater 
Wednesday, tlie 25tli at 11:30.
At present the designing commit
tee is busy with the decorations and 
expects to have tilvem ready for the

ASSEMBLYJIMMIE GIFFIN
SPEAKSPLEBE GETS HAIRCUT
Last week at Assembly a Tech 
Alumnus, Jimmie Giffin, Science, 20, 
spoke a few words. Giffin is a grad
uate of Commercial Engineering and 
now holds 'a responsible position with 
the Bank of Pittsburgh. He came to 
Assembly with some moving pictures 
produced by the Bank of Pittsburgh, 
illustrating the organization and sys
tems used in the large banks today. 
Banking and banking systems are a 
dark chapter to most people and the 
aim of this picture is to give the pub
lic an idea of how such institutions 
are conducted?
After the movies and announce
ments the Plebe Regulation Commit
tee took charge of assembly and two 
Plebes who had been rather unruly 
were brought up before the student; 
body. One had to explain and go into ! 
the details of the crime committed 
by the other and also to apologize 
for having gone into Room 61. Then
As Treasurer of the Student 
Friendship Fund drive at the Carnegio Institute of Technology, held 
January 12, 13, 14, Dean Tnrboll
makes a preliminary report that to 
date, January 20th, the amount of 
$632.27 has been collected in cash 
from students and faculty, tho Mar
garet Morrison Carnoglo students 
contributing $316 of this total. As 
some small amounts ate still to come 
in, a final repoit will bo made in 
next weeks Tartan.
The purpose oli this college-wide 
campaign to raiao money for desti
tute students an'iL.toaehfU's in foreign 
universities was endorsed by the Stu
dent Council and tho Executive Com
mittee of the General Faculty. Tho 
Council, having last year doslgnatod 
the Tolcnon Club as tho organization 
to conduct all drives on tho campus 
of a philanthropic nature, turned this 
particular drive over to tho Teknon 
Club. Tho Good Samaritan Commit
tee of the club organized tho drive, 
calling-in a corps of assistant work
ers. Thie committee consisted of 
I-Iolen Reed, chnlrman; Josephine 
Stewart, from Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie Gdlloge; A. C. Irwin, Indus
tries; II. C. Doudon, Arts; L. R. Alli
son, Engineering, and II. C. HodVor, 
prosldent of Tolcnon Club as worlcerat-la rgo.
In connection with this reporl 
Deans Scales and. Tarboll aro anxious 
to pay tribute to the splondld organ
ization which made possible the cam
paign, and tho hard work done 'by tho 
committee and Its assistants. No 
drive for purely altruistic purposes 
has ever met with such succoss on 
the campus.

The next issue of the Carnegie 
Technical"Journal will be on sale on 
Friday of this week. It is expected 
to be the best Technical Journal yet 
produced by any Technical staff. 
Professor Estep, of the Mechanical 
Department, has written an article 
"The Use of Pltot Tubes in the Meas
urement of the Flow of Fluids," 
which will contain much useful In
formation for those interested in that 
subject. Mechanical Engineers and 
others interested in the' flow of fluids 
have been somewhat handicapped by 
the fact that no text-book covers this 
field and this article was written by 
Prof. Estep at the request of several 
practicing Engineers,
Mr. V. P. Spinoso, vice president of 
the Consolidated Expanded Metals 
Company, gives some very useful In
formation to the young engineer in 
school. He has made a close study 
of the young engineer, of his faults 
and his virtues, and so Is an author
ity on that subject,
Mr, Coryrlon Carr, of the United I 
States Bureau of Standards, Wash
ington, D, G /also Writes an artlc/Io 
for this Issue of the Technical Jour
nal entitled "Tho Galvan 1/,Ing of NonFerrous Melals. Mr. Carr obtained 
his data and information from a mas
terful survey of the subject by Dr. 
Werner Lange, a famous scientist of 
Germany.
Professor Lfghtcap of the Mathe
matics Department, gives a discus
sion full of useful information on tho 
subject of "Price Indices. it takes up 
the value and usei of price indiccs and 
how they are determined.
The Carnegie Technical Journal 
can be obtained Friday from sales
men. The price is twenty-five cents.
In answer' to a request from the i 
Editor of the Tartan, Professor E. 
Esquerre; head of the Department of 
iStudonf. Health, sends the following 
Information:
The physical condition of tlio en
tering class this year showed little 
difference from that of its predeces
sors in the last eight years. Wo still 
had our 50 per cent of underweight, 
22 por cent of Thyroid enilargoment, 
10 per cont. defective oyos, 7 por cent 
poor teotflu; so that we started tho 
school year on a footing of1 parity 
with otlior years.
Up to tho Christmas rocoss, the 
student body onjoyod very satlstnctory health. A fow colds, a few bolls 
(many loss than in previous yoars), 
quite a fow Injuries sustained in tho 
field, tho gymnasium or tho shops, 
foprosonlod tho groatost percentage 
of tho cases soon by Dr. Marks. No 
Infoctlous dlsoasos, no medical cases 
In hospitals. Wo had, however, throe 
surgical cases, ono operation for ap
pendicitis, two for livern la.
. 3hi>. end ol! the. OhtilsLni|ia. jwoavhs, 
brought about a 'change Invariably 
following that vacation. A. groat In* 
eroaso In tlio numbor of dally con
sultations with a high porcontago of 
biliousness, colds, laryngitis, pharyn
gitis, tonsil ills. From Tuesday, Janu
ary 3rd, to Thursday, January 12th, 
or 7 school days, 174 patient* called 
on Dr. Marks for advleo, more pa
tients than wo had during tho whole 
month of Octobor. Of tliioso 1.74 cases 
42 por cent woro suffering from colds 
or rosultlng conditions; 17.5 per cont 
woro suffering rrom blllousnoss; 18 
por cent were suffering from In
juries; I) per cont woro suffering 
from 20 different conditions, none of 
them serious.
We lutvo here, once again, the 
usual post holiday picture probably 
rosull.lng from abundant eating, lato 
hours, no exorclso, little sloop and 
favoring a lowered roslstanco predis
posing to 111 health, which, fortunate
ly, this yoar, was nothing worse Hum 
colds and biillousnoss, Suppose, how
ever, Lbajt) an epidemic of lnllenza 
had developed In tlio city during the 
'holidays, how would tho returning 
student body boon able to moot It? 
What toll In time lost and' possibly 
life would havo been levied?
We may not always bo as fortun
ate as wo have b,een this year and 
tills seoms to bo an eminently oppor
tune time to remind tho student body 
or tho old adago about tho ounce or 
prevention and the pound ot cure and 
to make onco moro a strong plea tor 
co-operation with tho Department of 
Student Health. Live simple, hygi
enic, regullar lives; three meals a day,
7 or 8 hours sleep, a lot of exercise, 
cleanliness of tho body, and last but 
not least, water drinking in liberal 
amounts; report as quickly as pos
sible all conditions of ill health, seek 
advice and we may be able to face 
'the remaining hard months of the 
winter with fair prospects tor a con
tinuance. ol the good health that we 
enjoyed up to Christmas time and 
which we could always enjoy ir we 
couild only use a little intelligence 
and subject ourselves to a little dis
cipline.

At tlio Iveltor gymnasium last Fri
day night tlio Grove City quintet 
were handed the first defeat suffered 
on their home lloor for two years. 
In twenty-two consecutive games: they 
captured tho laurels of victory. Thom 
they met Carneglo Tech. Tech, like 
Caosar, came, saw and "vlcled," and 
broke Grove Citys long string of vlotories. It was a game in which the 
vanquished was vanquished, not bocauso they were inferior, but because 
th* victorsi wore suporlor.
Tho game was a delight to tho 
heart of a basket ball fail, with a 
combination of skillful passing, clev
er :j oar work, close guarding, and 
cloau playing, it was perhaps tho 
.rask*i.t game played on the Keller 
couvt for years. The rooting was inton.e. Grove City fans begged tlie'r 
team 'to overcome that slight lead 
which tho Tartans had won even 
from tho start. But tho trusty Car
negie guards kept tholr score down, 
while the unfailing shot of Tochs fovwan's kept the Plaids score growing. 
Carnoglo had no starsthey had a 
team and team work won tlio gamo.

to plans and features o intorost in 
regard to those events.
An explanation was given as to tho 
reasons ror the extra charge foij ad
mittance to basket ball games at the 
Motor Square Garden. When tho 
Athletics Fund budget was made out 
before the beginning of the first semoster, it was not known Mint such a 
place would be available, and was not 
Included in the budget expenses, and 
since it is so much of a convenience 
to basket ball fans to have a suitable 
floor where the seeing is good, the 
Sllglit extra charge should cause no 
objections. Those who attended the 
last game saw a real show of skill, 
and tho student body Is expected to 
co-operate in attending in large num
bers and so make tills venture a suc
cess at the future homo games.
Attention was called to the poor 
attitude of the Plebes in regard to 
regulations and It was revealed that 
many were avoiding appearance at 
trial. Several Plebes were detained 
at the close of assembly, when tho 
Sophomores held an emergency trial 
to sentence delinquents.

THE POINT SYSTEM, AT LAST!
The Point System as passed by the Student Council, becomes ef
fective at once. The committee lias done considerable revision and 
the system as ofJler'ed is a fine start. Tlie need ol: a Point System 
\vas realized last year and llie action ol. the Student Council last 
Sunday realized the beginning of better activities.
At present a man may be engaged in as many activities as he 
desires. Besides doing his school work, he must spend a considerable 
amount of time in the activities in which he is engaged. Both are loo 
much for one man, and either the activities or the mans scholastic 
standing must suiter. If his scholastic work falls then it affects but 
the man himself, but if the activities arc to suffer, then it affects the 
entire student body. The Point System was proposed to eliminate 
this fault, also to bring more men out for activities and to give some 
valuation to minor positions which were not considered with due 
importance.
Undoubtedly the Point System, as offered, will have many critics. 
Many activities' are perhaps overrated:or underestimated and some ac
tivities may not be mentioned at all. Such things .will perl'oct them
selves with time. To perfect the Point System,'it will require data 
collected over a period ol! years, and the committee will be constantly 
revising the valuation ol! activities.
A start has been made. The co-operation of every man in activi
ties is required and must be had. An enormous amount of data must 
be collected and classified. The Point System committee will be re
sponsible for this, but to do their work well they must have the sup
port and help of every man in activities.

NOTICES
ARTS THEATER  Bill Says
"THE DEATH OF TINAGILES"
In some ways the most distinctive 
production of the season was given 
for tlje first time on Friday after
noon In the Arts Theater. This was 
"The Death of Tintagiles," by Maur
ice Maeterlinck. To produce a play 
written by Maeterlinck in 1899 should 
not be a startling adventure; the .fact 
remains that In these "United States 
in 1922 It is. With little sympathy for 
those who go looking with a dark 
lantern for the revival of romanti
cism in these days, one can say that 
whatever his absurdities and insipid
ities eilseWhere, here the Eelgian has 
dramatized an emotion, has built up 
to a crushing climax the feeling of 
fear of the unknown and of pity for 
innocence in the grip of evil. Here 
with a vengeance are the Stagirite's 
pity and terror. (But as Fanny asked, 
"Who. was the Stagerit6?)
The play has been sympathetically 
and beautifully directed by Professor 
Wallace, indeed there Is not a move
ment or posture that, one would like 
Changed. The production, moreover, 
owes not a little to Mr. Mudgetts 
setting and lighting; whaever his/ in
tended symbolism, the pictures are 
steadily beautiful and; the lighting is 
the most iillusive andlovely that our 
stage has seen in 'many a day, though 
those who want to see eveiy splinter 
of the stage will not like it. The 
honors of the piece are Miss Lowes 
as Ygraine. An onerous and exhaust
ing part she sustains proudly; her 
terrific climax might be equally ef
fective if she toned down her earlier 
scenes. She creates some of the best 
pictures of the piece. Miss Osborne 
as the little prince Tintagiles is very 
skilful and appealing; her gestures 
and intonations are in character. The 
rest of the cast is steadily helpful 
though Mr. Lazarus is hampered by a 
costumes that has a comic twinge. The 
other costumes by Miss Cohen are 
very satisfying.
It is to be desired that more stu
dents patronise the matinee perform
ances designed for them. No one wlio 
has ever been finely entertained in 
the theater should miss this play, 
though it might be well to check his 
sense of humor and borrow a bit of 
imagination before entering this mad
mans fairyland.

BALL COMMITTEE REPORTS TO 
ARTS ASSEMBLYINCREASE 
IN SCHOOL DUES AGREED UPON
Eve Hughes presided at Arts As
sembly last week. Treasurer Highberger reported $115.19 in tlhie treas
ury. Wm. Burke, chairman of the 
ball committee, reported that the 
name of the ball had been changed 
to the Spanish 'Fiesta en Granada.* 
He also stated that $1.50 was hardly 
sufficient school dues to cover the 
ball and the committee therefore rec
ommended that an increase be made. 
It was moved, seconded and carried 
that the school dues for the year 1921- 
22 be $2.50 for every student. Arthur 
Lubln.vjin charge of the entertain
ment for the ball, outlined the pro
gram, stating that there would be 
considerable work, especially on the 
costumesthere being at least SO of 
them to bo mado.
J. Franklin, 'chairman of the social 
committee, announced that the usual 
Wednesday afternoon dance would be 
on Thursday.
This year brings a new kind of 
contest between the two great Eng
lish universities, Oxford and Cam
bridge, In the form of an aeroplane 
match. The first inter-varsity flying 
matleh. will be held at tlie Hendon 
Airdrome, and will consist of three 
events Which ought to produce keen 
competition, since both institutions 
can claim men who learned their 
avjation during the war.
The committee of the three mens 
schools appointed to .present some 
form of 'Senior Distinctive Dress ap
probate the criticism offered in The 
Tar ran last week, but would rather 
that it be more constructive in. na
ture.
In justification to ourselves, and in 
repudiation of charges of inactivity 
by the above mentioned critic, we 
-wish to state that numerous me.it-j 
ings have been held, many inquiries; 
have been submitted to us, but that 
as a result of all of these confer
ences and inquiries we were unable 
to fnd any proposition which could 
be sold to the class.
Prior to our decision to abandon 
the idea of distinctive dress we con
sidered that, a plan of distinctive 
drevn to be successful must be sale
able to practically the entire class 
and1 must be worn by the Senior 
^Class only. To solve the first proolem it. is necessary to keep the price 
.within reach of the entire class, 
must be of good enough quality to 
please the most critical and must 
be collegiate and snappy and yet not 
foppish. The second problem pre
sents still a more difficult proposi
tion. Are the students of. Tech edu
cated up to the point where such a 
tradition can be established.
As a result of these existing ob
stacles, the committee decided it would 
be a -better plan to start Senior priv
ileges, and educae the Student Body 
up to the fact that the Senior is a 
pecuHar and distinct ' specie, and is 
entitled to a few privileges for havjng thus far so valiantly withstood 
the attacks of the professors.
Wo have, therefore, quite a few 
suggestions along this line which will 
be presented at the next meeting of 
the Senior Classes. We are quite 
desirous of obtaining more sugges
tions from members of the student 
body. If these are handed to vari
ous Senior Presidents they wrill find 
their way into" our hands and receivi* due consideration.

SCHOOL PLEBE DANCE
One of the best dances the campus 
has even seen was the Freshman 
dance held in the Union on Friday, 
the 20th. From all angles the danceWas a successful one and one that 
will long be remembered by the 
Plebes who attended. For this one 
night the Plebe put away his lessons 
and "stepped out.
Much credit is due the committee 
headed by Mr. Moessner. Fine music, 
a prize balloon dance, and the novel
ty dance by "Doc" Taylor showed 
thar the committee had worked hard.
The Plebes are proud of the suc
cess of this dance and know that it 
will go down in the histoi-y of the 
camrusi as a fine Plebe event.

PLAID ATHLETICS
TWO BIG GAMES ON 
CARD FOR WEEK
Carnegie Tech Meets W.&J. 
and Grove City This "SVeek 
at Motor Square Garden
With two heap big scalps neatly 
tucked away in their belt, the Plaid 
Flingers are eager for the big frays 
to come this week end. First is the 
joust with Washington & Jefferson 
Thursday night, at Motor Square Gar
den. Remembering keenly the blow 
handed to them just two weeks ago 
by these old rivals of Little Washing
ton, the Tartans thirst for revenge. 
The opportunity offered Thursday is 
looked upon with delight. That game 
is going to be some game. The 
Tartan - President clashes always 
arouse tremendous interest. Every
body is going to be there, the Mag
gie Murphs, the Engineers and Arts 
and Industries. And of course the 
cheerleaders and the band. All Tech 
is aching to root for the team Thurs
day night at the biggest game of the 
season.
After squaring up matters with W. 
& J. the team is called upon to de
fend Carnegie's growing reputation 
from the invasion Saturday night by 
the fast bunch from Grove City. That 
will be no mean task. In Smith, Fos
ter, Jones, Qtephanian, Sellers, Shorts 
and Abrams, Grove City has an ag
gregation who know just about all 
there is to know about basket ball, 
and smarting from the fresh defeat 
which Tech just handed them, are de
termined to come back with a kayo. 
Grove City whipped the Tartans 
twice last year, 32 to 29 and 43 to 20. 
To take count .Saturday nightCar
negie must show everything they 
have to win. To* keep in the run for 
the tri-State championship they must 
win. This game means a lot to both 
teams and. will be a battle royal. A 
herd of rooters is coming from Grove 
City to cheer their team to victory. 
All Tech must be there to drown out 
the war cries of the enemy. When 
that old Tech Spirit gets working, 
backing up the team, the team never 
losses. Spsychology quoth Prof. Bing
ham.
'See Carnegie Techs latest cage 
stars in action! Remember, Thursday 
nightW. & X, 'Motor Square Gar
den; Saturday nightGrove City, at 
Motor Square Garden. HOOT MON!
Carnegie Has All Plebe Team; 
Chalk Up Second Victory
The idea of | a reserve basket ball 
squad has been dropped and an 
All-Freshman * quintet appears in its 
place. With two victories' to their 
credit, as a starter, and an eager and 
determined squad of former high 
school tossers out for practice every 
evening at the Gym, there is chance 
for a very good season for these Tar
tan youngsters.
The first game was1 won from 
Westinghouse Tech 24 to< 21.
The second game, played last Fri
day afternoon at the Tech Gym was 
an exhibition of real basket ball, 
with team work of the highest cailiber. The Sacred Heart High School 
of Center avenue with a spunky,- 
spirited team having taken over 
Arnold (High, Shady avenue. 26 to 15, 
came over to trim the Tech Plebes.

Opponents Take Lead Early. 
Game Close at Times
The second game  of the Grove 
City-Allegheny trip was lost to Alle
gheny College, Meadville, Pa., Satur
day, January 21st.
The opening lineup differed from 
the winning combination of the Grove 
City game the night previous in that 
Gibson (guard) replaced Allen, Saw
yer (guard) replaced Bell, and Bell 
replaced Potter (center).
It was a fast game, but the Mead
ville Tossers found our guard posi
tions weak and took the lead early 
in the game. The new lineup was re
placed by the veteran players of the 
previous night at the beginning of 
the second half. A speedy contest en
sued in which only four fouls were 
called. The game was credited by the 
Methodists as being the most excit
ing ever played in Meadvilile.

When the Tartan Tossers returned 
Sunday from their Grove City-Alle
gheny trip they couldnt say enough 
about the wonderful support accord
ed the home teams, by the abovementioned colleges. Both games were 
played before large crowds, composed 
of the entire student body of each 
institution, respectively. Cheer lead
ers, in uniform, kept the haills re
sounding with encouragement to the 
players during the entire period of 
playing'; A courtesy which Tech might 
well follow, was accorded our five at 
Allegheny when we received the first 
cheer, with both teams on the floor, 
before tifoe game. The men declare 
that these were two of the cleanest 
games of basket ball they have ever 
played. This must be evident by the 
fact that there was no personal fouls 
called during the Grove City contest 
and only a few at Allegheny. No ar
guments between players occurred at 
any time during either game.
INTER-FRAT DORMITORY
LEAGUE ADOPTS RULES
The second week of InterTFraternity basket ball has been successfully 
completed with the exception of one 
game postponed. The better teams 
are beginning to show up and somrlast games are being played. The 
game between S. A. E. and Kappa 
Sigma Rho last week was one of 
the fastest and best so far.
Last Friday afternoon a meeting 
of the league was held in the Sci
ence Club Room. The question of 
referees was brought up and it was 
voted to hire two men to officiate at 
the games.- Each fraternity will be 
assessed proportionately. The eligi
bility of players was thoroughly dis
cussed. The following amendment in 
regard to elegibility was passed, to 
take effect next year: Men who are
on the. Varsity or Freshmen squads 
after the last cut by the coach are 
ineligible for .Inter-Fraternity basket 
ball.
On The Plaid Screen
BY H. F. SIMPSON
BASKET BALL 
BricksFlowersSupport.
The basket ball team lias won and lost. It stepped forward when it 
defeated Grove City. It slipped back just, as much when it lost to Allegheny.
The Plaid Screen thinks a little consistency added to the teams repertory 
would aid materially. (The truth, it hurts sometimes, but withal, some
times it takes a wound to really heal.)
To every question there are two sides: the fair and square, and the 
wrong. A good sport always takes the former.
Carnegie lost to Allegheny, or better, Allegheny beat usgive it to 
them! They did it because they have a good team. BUT, in the same 
breath, sing it out to the world: Allegheny, well get you next time!"
THIS, not because we are revengeful, but because we have that light, and 
that determination that means nothing more or less than a "come-back."
The students expect a come-back, therefore, such being the case, it 
doth behoove that a rousing welcome be given the team when they appear 
upon the Motor Square Garden floor tomorrow night for their game with 
Wash-Jeif. This should be repeated on Saturday night, when Grove City 
comes to Pittsburgh for their return game.
So, fellows, dig out that "two bits, drag out your student ticket, and 
present yourself on the floor tomorrow night, and help the band and the 
cheer-leaders. You owe it to the team. Theyre giving their best for the 
glory and fame of Carnegie Tech, and what is glory for Carnegie Tech is 
glory-for the student body. Forget your scrupleslay aside your discontent, 
and tomorrow night start being a real Carnegie Man. Any man can support 
a winning team, but it takes a real man to support an in and outer.
And while on this subject
IT MIGHT BE WISE 
to explain one of the causes of discontentthe extra charge at the Motor 
Square Garden.
Getting down to rock-bottom facts, it is the method chosen to take care 
of an extra, and unprovided for expense. It costs more to buy a palace, than 
a log hut. The more one gets, the larger the payment. To play basket 
ball in a better place is more expensive than to play in an inferior place, and 
the more so, when that better place is owned and rented as a money-making 
proposition.
In other words, it is an additional expense for Carnegie Tech to stage 
her basket ball games in the Motor Square Garden. This additional expense 
was not included in the 1921-22 budget as approved by the Athletic Council. 
This, because it was not known at the time that the Motor Square Garden 
would be available.
Fellows, you are criticizing unfairlyyou are looking from the wrong 
perspective. You are kicking. You are not proving yourself a Real Tech 
Man. Forget your troublesget behind Techcease your critcizingstop 
kickingyou are, all of you, Real Tech Men at heart.
The presence of Sully and his band, together with two cheer-leaders 
at the Lafayette game was surely a sight worth seeingr They did their bit 
in great style. They will continue doing their bit, too. To make their work 
more convincing, why not paint a sign: STUDENT CHEERING SECTION, 
and place it in the Garden, and in that manner, gather the Carnegie clieerers 
together in a mass and get concerted cheering?
EXIT RESERVEENTER FRESHMAN BASKET BALL
The All-Reserve basket ball team is now a thing of the past. In its 
place is an All-Freshnmn teamand its a good ono, too! They combine 
team-work with good natural ability. Their passing is fast and aceurato. 
Many of them will make good varsity material in the future. They are 
coached by the versatile Bob Waddell, who seems to have Installed into 
them some of his dash and enthusiasm, which together with their natural 
adeptness makes, them perhaps as good a Freshman team as thero is in the 
district. In two starts, two victories have been turned in. From all indica
tions, this good work will continue.
Fellows, they have the goodsshow your appreciationget behind thorn 
attend their gamescheer them on to victoryif you do that, suroly thoy 
will show their appreciation by putting forth their best for the school, and 
for your entertainment.
Last years championship team of Grove City trimmed by Carnogie Tech! 
thats a good feather in our hat. Am I not right? Sure!
A loss to Allegheny!doesnt hurt muchwell trim 'em worso than 
they trimmed us >vlien wo meet them on the'homo floor! Cnrnegle spirit and 
come-back will do that!
FACULTY SPIRIT
The new Scholastic Coaching Plan is a good one and will tend to clear 
up many difficulties in athletics at Carnegio Tech. Much praise1h duo to 
those members of the Faculty, headed by Professor Loeds, who have worked 
out this planthoy surely have showed the proper Faculty Spirit. It, Is only 
through such backing by the members of the Faculty that, will work in the 
future towards a bigger, broader and hotter Carnogie Tech. both scholastic
ally and athletically. Let us liopo that this good work will extend outward 
from the group who are interested and permeate itself firmly throughout 
that small group who lack that intorost.
Those students who have not read this plan in full, would do well to do 
soit was printed in full in last weeks TARTAN..
INTER-FRATERNITY AND INTER-DORMITORY BASKET BALL
The Inter-Fratfernity and Dormitory Basket Ball Loagiiqs are moving 
along in a most promising style. Such should bo the case, lor the good that 
they perform Is great. The good Is both to the school In gonoral. by per
meating a better feeling of good-will botwoon the dormitories and the fra
ternities, and to the athletic association, in that plontiful opportunities are 
given to non-varsity basket ball men for development. Spirited crowds are 
attending the games in support of their favoritos.
Mention here should be made of the cup given to the winner. This, cup 
is so old and care-worn, that it is no longer a suitable prize for tile winner. 
It is even a disgrace to its function. Why not each Fratornlty and Dormitory 
assess itself a small sum of, say two dollars, and purchase a now and suitable 
cup? There are twenty-three teams in the three leagues together, which 
would give forty-six dollars, which surely would buy a cup thatVould bo a 
credit to the victor, and something worth showing-off. Give this matter a 
thought.
Give old demon FLUNK the K. O.!
PRINTING DEPARTMENT
DOES VARIED WORK
Dnring the present semester the 
Department of Printing has turned 
out some remarkable work, including 
a twenty-four page book of reviews 
for the Bureau, of Mines, an 8-page 
menu for the Ben Franklin Ban
quet^ of the Typothetae, a program 
in colors for Carnegie Day Celebra
tion, colored folders for the Charities 
Association of Pittsburgh, a twentypage catalogue for the International! 
Institute of Pittsburgh, and the last 
issue ot The Carnegie Technical 
Journal. This variety of work is nec
essarily of the most particular in re
quirements for quality, and the de
partment has received much favox-- 
able comment. Many smaller jobs 
have also kept the men very busy.
The department has the largest en
rollment in its history, with over one
hundred enrolled, and new students 
coming in at the beginning of the 
next semester. Beside their regular 
studies and practice in the various 
branches of the printing industry the 
students of this department have the 
privilege oL taking up chemistry, Eng
lish, mathematics, design, psychology, 
estimating and cost finling, and other 
subjects. Many of the students are 
taking advantage of their opportun
ities and each of the classes mention
ed has printing students enroHed.'
It is interesting and pleasing to 
note that a number of the printing 
students who have had a year or 
more in the department are meeting 
their expenses while here by/ doing 
extra work in the printing plants of 
the,city. By this means lliey make it 
possible to continue1 their college 
work, and in addition they get valu
able experience and practice in the 
actual work of the industry.

EXHIBITIONS OF OLD
MASTERS ORIGINALS
Through the kind generosity of M. 
Herbert DuPuy an exhibition of 42 
original sketches, executed by ' old 
masters, are placed on exhibition in 
the small gallery of the College of 
Fine Arts, and to Mr. DuPuy we ten
der our sincere appreciation.
Among this rare collection is a 
sketch by Francois Boucher, one of 
the most important painters and dec
orators of the Rocco period. He was 
an artist of prodigious facility and 
Indefatigable industry. Although pas
toral scenes were his most favorite 
subjects ho is most popular as the 
painter of the Graces." A sketch of 
A Bishop Reading," by Andrea de 
Sarto, portrays his true pictorial 
style and enviable balance of execu
tive endowments. There are two 
sketches by Claude de Lorraine, 
French landscape painter, a man wlio 
possessed the greatest power of in
vention and surpassed all of his ri
vals in landscape painting.
Two Female Figures," by Murillo, 
the great Spanish1 painter, is included 
in the collection. Murillo came from 
itho school of ''Seville and Ms chief 
importance consists in the wonderful 
manner in which lie employed the me
dium of Spanish realistic forms to ex
press ideal religious conceptions, 
^lien there Is a sketch by Rem
brandt, the Dutch painter and Otcflier. 
This sketch proves clearly the state
ment that when ho has a character 
to express lie does It with a touch 
and an evidence of thought entirely 
his . own. It may sometimes take a 
disagreeable, even an Ignominious 
appoaranco and Ills drawings In a 
given case may not bo distinguished 
or refined or evon truthful, while, 
yot tho significance of tho statement 
ho wlslio to make remains uniform
ly distinct and positive.
Sketch .I by Guido Renl aro also 
represented. This grand mas toi* was 
unequalled In stylo and manner. 
There was always a delicacy of line 
and a sympathetic refined feeling to 
bis drawings. Wo thon come to a 
spotcii by Tintoretto, the groat Ital
ian painter, who painted with such 
extraordinary faculty and rapidity as 
to gain the epithet El Furloso.
Two sketches by Van Dyck, the 
most Important portrait painter, af
ter Rubens, are included. Then there 
is a sketch by Leonardo du Vinci, 
that most extraordinary versatile 
genius of that ago of geniuses, the 
Renaissance.
Works of other groat masters such 
as Francesco Abano Bartolomeo, 
Randenelli, Giovanni Francesco Barbiere, Fra Bartolomeo, the Caracci 
'brothers, Lodovico, Cigoli, Giovanni 
Battista Ciiprani, Domenico Cresti, 
Stefano Della Bella, Lodewyk Faibricino Dubourg, Benedetto Lutl, Carlo 
Maratta, Franciesco Mazzurli, J. M. 
Moran, Grovanni Battista Pazzi, Gran 
Franciesco Penni, Nicolas Poussin, 
Franciesco Salviati, Franciesco' Vanni, Anthonie Waterlo, Domenico Zampieri, Battista Zellotti and Federigo 
Zucliero are also exhibited.
It is the most valuable collection 
ever exhibited here and it affords the 
art student a rare opportunity for 
study. The exhibition mil end on 
Monday, January 30th.

Secretarial Club Meeting
The Secretarial Club, which was 
organized in the Spring of 1921, held 
its regular monthly meeting on last 
Tuesday evening, January 1. A very 
delicious dinner was served hy the 
Juniors of the department.
After-dinner speeches were made 
by Misses Fire and Kruger. They told 
about their experience in the business 
world. "Finished Products," Miss 
Hester, president of the club, called 
them in introducing them and their 
speeches proved them worthy of the 
title. The talks were very beneficial 
to all present, alumnae as well as 
students.
After the speeches the club, ad'journed to the Rec. Hall, where an 
evening of games was enjoyed.
It was not known by the students 
that they could get in touch with all 
the Secretarial Alumnae through the 
Alumni Office. They earnestly desire 
the presence of all Alumnae of the 
Secretarial Department at tliese 
meetings. The meeting dates will In 
tli|e future be announced on the 
Alumni Page of the Tartan and 
whether you get a personal notice or 
not be sure that you are welcome.
Dinner-Dance.
Marlon Keefer,  chairman of the 
dance committee, reports satisfactory 
progress and urges all alumnae to 
mark the date February 14th on their 
calendars. Call up your friends and 
arrange your own party to attend 
this event. Call them anyway and 
remind them. Lots of them dont read 
their Tartans and lament afterwards 
that they did not know about a cer
tain event which they wished very 
much to attend! Others forget the 
date! So if you want to see your 
friends at this dance you had better 
do it little telephoning.
Miss Keefer has asked itlie follow
ing girls to assist her: Mary Wil
liams, Lucy Sierwalt, Mary Cum
mings Keaney and Callle Hunter 
Brown.

Y. M. C. A. ACTIVITIES
The number of organizations using 
the "Y" Club for a place of business 
meetings is increasing.  All organi

the room. To avoid confusion, by 
having two or more organizations 
meeting at the same time, it is best 
to set a reservation for time with Mr. 
Davis, Techi "Y secretary.
The Y. M. C. A. swim will be to
night at the Schenley High School 
Tank. All students are invited to 
be there to swim at 7:30. The water
