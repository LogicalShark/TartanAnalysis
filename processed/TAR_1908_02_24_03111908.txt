24 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 11, 1908
GLEE CLUB CONCERT IS A SUCCESS
The third Annual Concert of the Combined Mu
sical Clubs of Carnegie Tech is now a part of past 
history. A large and enthusiastic audience was in 
attendance, and they applauded each number with 
a spirit that showed the true value of the perform
ance, even insisting on as many as two encores to 
some numbers and at least one for the rest. The se
lections of the Glee Club were mostly comic, together 
with a few of more serious vein. The two soloists 
of the evening, Messrs. Laithe and Robling, were 
well received and had to respond. Mr. Laithes sec
ond encore was the famous song, The Last One is 
the Best of All. A feature not on the program, but 
arranged just shortly before the beginning of the 
concert, was the rendition of two selections on the 
organ by Mr. Heinroth, which were very much appre
ciated.
The string quartette performed well and showed 
the effects of long practice. The Mandolin Club's 
numbers were somewhat lengthy but the audience 
seemed untiring whenever a lively piece was played 
and they, too, were forced to play encores. The 
chief fault seemed to lie with the audience in that 
they seemed to want to drag the concert out a little 
longer than was necessary, but, on the whole, Carne
gie Tech need not fear comparison with the best 
musical clubs of the collegiate world. The program 
was as follows:

PLEBES 
Now that it will be but a short time until the 
whirr of the lawn mower will be heard throughout 
the land, and the spring flowers poking their heads 
skyward, doesnt it strike you that now is the time to 
elect a manager for the base-ball team? Anyone 
who has ever had any connection with a school team 
will be able to verify my state nent that every selfrespecting school in the vicinity has the greater 
part of their schedules made out long before playing 
starts. This is certainly right from the common 
sense, as well as the energy viewpoint. It will ena
ble season tickets or something of that sort to be 
sold in advance, and that means part of the expenses 
assured. With a promising list of games away from 
home, meaning nice trips for the team, it ought to 
bring out all of those who can play the game, as 
well as those who want to know how, and make 
everyone devote their energies in this direction. 
Think over the ones who seem fitted for the place, 
and then vote for the best man.

The Civils played a good game on Feb. G, and

rallied, and with their splendid team work won in 
the last few minutes of play.

As was well remarked in an article in the last 
Tartan, Few students are without the idea that they 
are a little higher in the social scale than the other 
fellow. This statement although very broad, still 
leaves room for an exception which we think you 
would have little trouble noticing were you but to 
spend a day among the Industrial sections.
We will wager that the Plebes became so inter
ested in a few recent exchanges of compliments with 
us that they forgot all about those benches.
The draftsmen gladly welcome the change of 
schedule for Thursday P. M. This does much to al
leviate the congestion which has somewhat ham
pered our advancement in forging stunts, and to satusfy us for that eighteen pair of tongs offense.
Anyone desiring the company of a nurse for a 
week or so is advised to play with the new emery 
wheels.
The elite of the Industrial sections were the 
guests of Mr. Parsons At Home last Wednesday 
morning. A delightful fifteen minutes was spent at 
record cards. Among the prominent present were: 
Flynn, McKinney, McCance, Herron, Goucher, Rob
inson and Heinz.
We infer from an editorial in last weeks Tar
tan that Tech claims the origin of the ducking in ice 
water system. Again the Industrials come to the
fore and defy anyone to show us a precedent to the 
ducking that Frampton gave Einstein in the waste 
paper basket.
Mr. Birge is willing to give out the entire supply 
of Honors for the year within the next two weeks, 
provided you write something good. So if you feel 
a little shaky about the next visit to the office brace 
up and write like one possessed.
Will some one please explain just why Sossong 
and Werner insist upon a daily noon hour trip to 
Oakland.
Frampton has been improving his noon hours by 
taking some of the children upon distant excursions. 
Two visits to M. M. C. S. were made last week at 
which time the little one undertook to explain to 
the class some of the habits, etc., of the strange 
residents of the palace over the hill.
Glad hand for Davis.
Come out for track practice if only to see Flynn
run.
Ask Sossong about the undertaking establish
ment.
Professor (addressing Burnsworth)Now,
Bernhardt.
iSuilivan and Johnson have rejoined the drafts
men after a sojourn of two months in the prep sec
tions. McCue has also rejoined the machinists.
The Industrial basket-ball game with Tarentum 
High School was not canceled through misrepre
sentation by the Plebes, as was mentioned in the last 
Tartan, but rather through mismanagement of the 
Tarentum team.

The writer of the article entitled By the Way, 
in last weeks Tartan, seems to be taking too gloomy 
a view of existing circumstances. The girls of the 
Margaret Morrison School have no ill feeling against 
any of the other schools, neither do they wish any
one to think that they feel themselves socially su
perior, or no more so than is their womanly right. 
We believe heartily that In Unity is Strength, and 
are very willing to do all in our power to further 
comradeship and good will in the schools. Were the 
gentlemen of the School of Applied Science only 
half as willing, the dove of peace would brood over 
Carnegie Tech, from now, henceforth, and forever.
We suggest as a new school song the well-known 
hymn, Lo! what a pleasing sight are brethren that 
agree.

A PROTEST.
While I was walking home from school the other 
day an intelligent looking lady stopped me and asked 
where a certain street was located. As I passed it 
on my way home, we walked together for a short 
distance on Forbes street.
We at once exchanged remarks on the weather 
and then she asked me what school I attended. I 
gladly told her The Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School, whereupon she asked me to tell her what 
we were taught. I told her about the different 
studies, but when I came to Social Ethics she asked 
me if I would explain just what I meant by those 
words. Proudly I began the well-learned definition, 
Social Ethics means moralsthat is, relating to 
right and wrong in character. Scarcely had I said 
the words when she returned indignantly, It would 
be a little better for Pittsburg if more of this subject 
were published instead of so many advertisements 
of the Tech Beer. Before I could assure her that 
our beloved Tech School had nothing to do with this 
advertisement, she continued, And I suppose you 
learn all the fine points of the brewing of Tech beer 
in your cooking lessons! Finally I convinced the 
lady of her terrible mistake and I left her.
When I boarded the car I found five High School 
friends who immediately began to ask me questions 
about the Junior Prom. I told them all I could* 
when suddenly one of the girls made the sarcastic 
remark, And Tech Beer is the striking feature of 
the evening! Is it any wonder the boys are so anx
ious to go! Once again I tried to explain that Tech 
Beer had nothing whatever to do with our school, 
but that the name Tech had arisen simply from

the technical process used in the manufacture of 
beer. But, said one of the girls, are not the red, 
yellow, green, and blue, which come on the labels, 
your school colors?
Why can not something be done to have this 
advertisement abolished? Or is it our school that 
has given to the Pittsburgh Brewing Company the 
right and the privilege of advertising their beer with 
the name Techthe name, which to the girls of 
the M. M. C. S. stands for the place of learning how?
Homes can be a place of light,
Where peace and hope and rest abound.
Cannot we, as a school, protest against this adver
tisement if necessary, time and again, so that no more 
persons in the future may confuse the odious name 
Tech Beer, with the name we love so well, Tech. - 
Ruth B. Henderson, 1910.
-----------o-----------
WHEN NOT TO ADVERTISE.
Will a merchant who is wise
Ever cease to advertise?
Yes
When the trees grow upside down;
When the beggar wears a crown;
When ice freezes on the sun;
When the sparrow weighs a ton;
When gold dollars get too cheap,
When secrets women keep;
When a fish forgets to swim;
When Satan sings a hymn;
When girls go back on gum;
When the small boy hates a drum,
When no politician schemes;
When mince pies make pleasant dreams;
When its fun to break a tooth;
When all lawyers tell the truth;
When cold water makes you drunk;
When you love to smell a skunk;
When the drummer has no brass;
When these things come to pass;
Then the merchant who is wise
Will neglect to advertise.

Apropos of the Occasion.
A .correspondent of the Tartan has forwarded 
the following for publication in our columns. As 
yet no official dictum has been given out from the 
Faculty and the editor has taken the liberty to mod
ify its introduction, only in so far as jt departs from 
official sanction. He says:
The book, to be published by a Board of Editors, 
which was to consist of four representatives (two 
day and two night) from each of the respective 
schools, whose colors are embodied in the Carnegie 
Tartan, is well under way; but the .School of Applied 
Science, although cordially invited, has, up to the 
present writing, failed to send representation.
An annual chronicle of the activities of the stu
dent body as a whole is much desired by every true 
son and daughter of Tech; moreover, some publi
cation of this style is supported by nearly every 
university or college of any size, notwithstanding 
that each graduating class of some of these institu
tions publish a class-book.
The above Board, then, takes this means to 
strenuously object to the action taken by the School 
of Applied Science in withdrawing from this all-im
portant factor of combined effort on the part of the 
student body as awhole and, in prospection, can 
see a severe rent in the fabric of co-operation which 
is, now, so firmly woven.
The key to the situation, the only logical escape 
from a state of affairs sad indeed to contemplate, is 
at present held by the Applied Science men; a little 
manly action on their part culminating -in a hasty 
combination of all parties concerned, is to the writer, 
the only method of guarding ourselves from the 
strife which has apparently been unloosed.
In the meantime this Thistle Board has gone 
ahead as fast as'possible with its work and the fol
io wing list of officers has been elected:

MIXTURE EFFECTS IN GAS ENGINES.
In a paper on Control of Internal Combustion 
in Gas Engines, presented at the annual meeting 
of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers by 
Prof. Charles Edward Lucke, the author discussed 
mixture effects, in part, as follows;
A variation of mixture may affect the combus
tion line through a change in the rate of propaga
tion, which results from changes in mixture propor
tion considered in conjunction with piston speed.
A slow burning mixture will tend to give a flatter 
combustion line with a fixed piston speed than a 
fast mixture. Likewise, a mixture may begin to 
burn rapidly and finish slowly, giving succeeding 
combustion lines which coincide in part, but which 
vary toward the end where the combustion line runs 
in to the expansion line from the dilution of the last 
part of the charge by early produced neutral gases. 
Through excessive dilution of some part of the mix
ture in the cylinder, which it must be understood is 
probably not homogeneous, some of the gas may not 
burn and on succeeding strokes the diffusion may 
be more or les complete than before, allowing the 
incompleteness of the combustion to vary toward the 
end of the process. The actual mixture under com
bustion consists not merely of air and gas, but rather 
air, gas and burnt or neutral gases. Any variation 
of proportion of the quantity of air, gas or burnt 
gases to the whole that may occur will produce vari
ations in combustion lines, but variations in com
bustion lines may just as well occur when the pro
portions of totals are constant, through lack of hrx, 
mogeneity of the mixture on successive strokes.
Excluding for the moment a consideration of
neutral products the problem of securing a proper 
proportion of air to gas in the cylinder is one of ori
fice flow, and the failure to secure it may be analyzed 
on the basis of the laws covering orifice flow. In 
this connection it must be remembered that it is not 
volume proportions that are most important, but 
irather. weight proportions, since it is a definite 
weight of air that is required to burn a definite 
weight of gas, al though volume proportionality will 
follow if the pressure and temperature of both the 
air and the gas are constant and the same, which 
unfortunately is seldom true. The orifices through 
which the air and gas flow separately to form the 
mixture are of very peculiar forms, as a rule, and 
not the same either in size or form, so that the laws 
of variation of proportion are reducible to the laws 
of variation in the weight of air per pound of gas 
flowing through separate orifices of different form 
and size at probably different temperatures and 
with different pressure drops or pressure heads.
It is well known that the co-efficient of efflux for 
the flow of gases through orifices varies with the 
size of opening, shape of opening and velocity of 
flow or pressure head. Air enters the engine cylin
der under the influence of a pressure head repre
sented by the cylinder vacuum. The gas, however, 
has a pressure higher than atmosphere if pressure 
gas and lower than atmosphere if suction producer 
gas, so that while the head causing the flow of air 
is the cylinder vacuum alone, the head causing the 
flow of gas when under pressures is the sum of the 
cylinder vacuum head and its own pressure head, 
and when undar suction is the difference between 
the cylinder vacuum and the gas pipe vacuum. Gas 
pressures are, moreover, never constant in practice 
nor will any of the gas pressure regulators proposed 
and used make them constant nor reduce them uni
formly to atmosphere because they always involve 
inertia effects of moving solid parts and of the gas 
itself.The National Engineer.

ONE ON McCRACKEN.
One day last week, as McCracken was leaving 
the Commons after having partaken of a heavy 
lunch and after purchasing'a bunch of three-for-five 
he stopped at the door to deposit the necessary 
amount with the receiving teller. Just as he hand
ed her (the teller) the money, she looked up into 
those lustrous grayish green eyes of his and said 
with a long drawn and heartfelt sigh, Oh, dear, I 
was just dreaming of you. A perceptible increase 
in the daily sales at the Commons has been noticed 
since this little incident.

A. F. Stamm, Editor.
Morgan (B-2), 1911, bought his four-year-old son 
a slide rule for a Christmas gift. He said he in
tended to start him early so that his Tech course 
would not be so hard.
Champion Glasser has been in three years a 
carpenter, a school teacher, ci*vil engineer and prem
ier pie consumer.
Wilharm and Stamm represent 1911 in the 
Mandolin Club. "Tickling the ding-pot  seems to 
come natural to these two as they would rather 
practice with the club than recite. (Maybe they 
need it.)
Nuts McCall was recently reported absent 
from school. Well, he wasnt, so no further apology 
is required.
The article on the Night Girls Dance, by a 
special reporter of the Tartan, seems to have given 
perfect satisfaction. Mr. Foster is being praised for 
the interest he showed in sending a man, but the 
girls really would like to get a chance to buy the 
Tartan regularly.
The report that 1911 intends giving a dance was 
true to a degree. There was one word left out which 
may change the complexion of the whole project. 
It should have read, "Maybe 1911 will give a dance 
in April.
Mcllvried, of B-2, has left school for the second 
time. You are welcome back at any time, Mac.
Mr. Stamm received a communication from Chi
cago, purporting to be from the Chicago Times, 
relative to the crane incident of the recent ban
quet. It was as incoherent a piece of literature as 
man ever read, which gives foundation for the belief 
that it was an attempt at wit on the part of some 
facetiously inclined students.
There is still a deficit of $8 to be made up to 
conclude the banquet affairs. A smoker is being 
talked about to raise this amount and incidentally 
to introduce some novel features by way of enter
tainment.
At the rehearsal on Sunday afternoon there were 
all the prominent types of mandolins. There was 
one Gibson, several Washburns and Brunos, and 
one which the owner called a Sperre & Hutchin
son. The members of the club were a long time

In the very near future Mr. Munk, of 1911, will 
contribute an article, Duelling in Europe. As Mr. 
Munk was an army officer and has fought on the 
Field of Honor several times, it will no doubt 
be quite entertaining.
What has become of the inter-class basket-ball 
arrangements?
Following an investigation of Minnesota student 
records to see if the students are overworked, the 
Minnesota Daily conducted a clever investigation to 
see if the faculty is overworked. Parodying the. 
lengthy official report the Daily decides that We 
find that the faculty, as a rule, is not-overworked. 
We find further, that about thirty per cent, are doing 
outside work for their own support. We find that 
ten per cent, belong to organizations, such as the 
committee on student work, the university council, 
and the program committees for the faculty dancing 
club; ana that the social side of the facultys life 
is not neglected.

NOT MAD, JUST SORRY.
The educated man to my mind, is one whose 
thoughts, studies, and experience have rounded out 
his character to such an extent that its refining influ
ence makes it possible for him to stoop to things 
small and narrow. The man whose mind is too 
broad to harbor conceit is the kind of man expected 
of Tech. Let every student of the School of Ap
plied Science and in the other schools as well, exam
ine himself and see if his mind is as broad as possi
ble.
To the students of the school of Apprentices and 
Journeymen and the Margaret Morrison School: 
The action of the School of Applied Science in ex
cluding us entirely from what they have styled the 
official year book, is the very height of narrow
mindedness. We feel that the matter has not re
ceived the attention of the educated ones, of which 
there are many to be proud of in the above named 
classes.
We have expected fair treatment from the Ap
plied Science students if for no other reason than 
than their advanced studies would put them above 
pettishness.
This is not a plea nor part in the book, in fact,
I can not see where one would gain by becoming a 
part of a publication put together by spirits so small 
that their efforts will reflect only discredit on them
selves and the Schools in general.

J. Le Roy Hoffman, Editor.
A few weeks ago 1910 commended us upon our 
enthusiasm in class affairs. A few more words of 
praise appeared last week. All of which 1912 grate
fully acknowledges and extend thanks for. If 10 
could have been within hearing distance of our last 
class meeting they would have seen and heard a class 
meeting worthy of praise. Nearly fifty members 
were present. How does that sound? And the way 
those fifty rushed business! One motion after an
other made and seconded, debated and voted upon 
in the twinkling of an eye. This class has had some 
strenuous class meetingsstrenuous, no matter from 
what point you viewed thembut this past meeting 
has undoubtedly been the onq at which the most 
business was transacted.
The attendance was a pleasant surprise to the 
officers and they dont know whether to attribute 
the inrease to increased enthusiasm in class affairs 
or to the weather. Pres. Helm, however, expresses 
a hopfe that it rains every class meeting night. Ev
erybody was not present, however, as witness the 
list of absent notables:
Chairman of Athletic Committee, McCowen.
The Exalted Grand Marshal, Skeehan.
The Basket-ball Star, Ralph Leety.
Chief Fusser No. 2, Newell.
Mr. Donergan, Chief Fusser No. 1, was present.
* * * *
Maisch, C-l, tackled the mandolin a few months 
ago, but he could not master it, so he is now taking 
instruction in piano playing, with which he seems 
to be meeting with more success. In fact, this young 
man after only two months trial, can now play, or, 
rather almost play, three lines of the chorus of No 
Wedding Bells for Me. We hope to persuade Mr. 
Maisch into giving us a few selections at some class 
meeting in the near future.
* * * *
Can you roller skate? Do you want to play 
push-ball? Wayman is on the Tech push-ball team 
and we understand there is room for one or two 
other good roller skaters.
* * * *
Was 1912 at the concert last evening? Sure 
thing, pard. Some were down stairsand some were 
in the attic. A few were also on the stage. A 
few had young ladies accompanying them and several 
others, who loudly protest that it was not because 
we couldn't get them, did not. There were also 
five or six 12 men at home. The reason? Oh,
theyre married, and they ---------. The balance is
obvious.

with Tech pennants. The report further says that 
said gentlemen received their prizes shortly after 
the smoker. Why wasnt this reported sooner? Well, 
among the several accomplishments overlooked dur
ing my early education was that of mind-reading. 
Of course, I agree with you that this oversight should 
not have occurred, and, of course, you will agree 
with me that it would not have occurred could 1

During the past week a number of our boys 
were being entertained at a house party given by a 
prominent hostess in one of the beautiful little towns 
on the Ohio river in Beaver county.
During the course of the last day, after a pleas
ant afternoon had been spent at cards the hostess 
announced she wished to present a prize, and 
brought forth an oblong package, handing it to the 
gentleman winning the highest number of games 
during the afternoon. He was a bit reluctant about 
opening it, as he surmised there was some joke 
being played, but finally was persuaded to peep in
side the neatly wrapped bundle, and to his surprise 
found that it was his own night-shirt, which he had 
failed to pack in his suit case on arising in the morn
ing. Of course, he was very much embarrassed, 
and blushed a rosy red in the presence of the ladies.
We believe we are safe in saying Gllie will have 
all his belongings safely tucked away on the next 
occasion of that kind.

On next Wednesday, March 18th, there will be 
a business meeting of the Atelier at eight oclock, and

arrangements for the annual patrons dinner.

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA RELAY RACE 
CARNIVAL, LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL.
Tech tc be Represented.
The Fourteenth Annual Relay Races given by 
the University of Pennsylvania will be held on the 
last Saturday in April. Invitation have been sent 
to all the leading educational institutions in the 
country and already entries are pouring in, guaran
teeing the success of this years meet. The Relay 
Races are probably the best known set of sports 
held annually in the world. They are likewise the 
largest. Last year over 200 scholastic and college 
teams faced the starter. 1,500 competitors tickets 
were necessary to supply the large number of ath
letes that competed in the different events. Yale, 
Cornell, Princeton, Chicago, Michigan, Dartmouth, 
Syracuse, in fact all the leading colleges were pres
ent while the schools were just as well represented. 
The institutions having teams in these races came 
from districts as far distant as west of Chicago, 
south of Richmond, and north of Boston. Every 
Intercollegiate champion both Western and Eastern 
then in college with but one exception competed in 
the special events. It is thus no wonder that these 
games attract to themselves such wonderful entries. 
Each year the best college and scholastic athletes 
of the country are at the Relay Races and it is an 
athletic education in itself to attend this meet. A 
relay team is composed of but four members so that 
it is within the power of any school or college to 
send their athletes to Philadelphia. This is done 
in many schools by popular subscription where the 
finances of the Athletic Association are not suffi
cient for the purpose.
This years meet needs only fair weather to 
make it the' most successful to date. All the big 
colleges have sent assurances that they will be rep
resented. Because of the Olympic Sports in London, 
all the star athletes will be in fine shape and they 
will all be on hand at Franklin Field on April 25th. 
It will be worth a long journey to see and be pres
ent at such an important athletic meet.
