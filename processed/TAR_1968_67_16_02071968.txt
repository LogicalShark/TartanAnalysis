Browns Statement Clarifies Various Rights of Students
5 George K. Brown, Dean of 
the Division of Student Affairs, 
today issued the draft of a state
ment on rights of assembly, ex
pression, and academic Freedom 
for Carnegie Mellon University 
students and faculty.
In an attempt to clear up 
questions concerning assembly, 
protest, and the university, 
) -Dean Brown has gathered to
gether existing policy and has 
added a few comments to bring 
that policy into focus.
C-MU recognizes the right 
and privilege of all students 
to exercise the constitutional 
guarantees of free assembly and 
expression. As a university sin
cerely espousing the philosophy 
^ of academic freedom, C-MU 
urges and supports its students 
desires an defforts to pursue 
these rights.
In instances where students 
wish to use these rights through 
protest or demonstration, the 
rights and privileges of ofhers 
must be considered. Thus,
1. The protset or demons tra. tion must be of an orderly na
ture so that no acts of force or 
violence shall occur and the 
normal orderly operation of the 
university will not be impeded.
2. The protest or demonstra
tion shall not infringe upon the 
rights or privileges of students 
not in sympathy with it. Thus, 
all students are assured that
V the idea or desires of others 
shall not be inflicted upon them 
and that they wil be allowed to 
exercise the right of free choice.
3. Finally, the freedom to dem
onstrate on the campus shall be 
limited to members of the cam
pus community only.
Dean Brown stressed that this 
is only a draft and not in final 
form. We would welcome any
* comments from the student 
body concerning this statement, 
he said in an interview with 
the Tartan. Concerning item 
three, he stated, There is going 
to be some question about this 
in the minds of some people. 
This campus is for the use of 
C-MU students, and, specifical
ly, it shouldnt be exploited by 
^ non-siudents.
However, item three of the 
statement does not, in his words, 
Exclude the possibility of invit
ing off campus people to a dem
onstration, so long as the uni
versity were aware of their com
ing.

For Three Rivers
In addition to the exhibition 
opportunity which has been of
fered area artists and crafts
men for the past eight years, 
local artists, architects, design
ers, etc. are this year invited to 
enter a competition for a de
sign to be installed on a bridge 
in the midst ; * the 1968 Three 
Rivers Arts Festival. The event 
will be held in Gateway Center, 
Pittsburgh, May 30 through 
June 9.
The winning entry of the spe
cial competition will be install
ed on the pedestrian bridge 
which crosses the Boulevard of 
the Allies between Gateway be
tween Gateway IV and (IBM 
Building) in downtown Pitts
burgh for the duration of the
11 day event. The nature of the 
competition is a design for a 
total environment that can be 
experience by visitors to the 
Festival.
The competition is open to 
those who are at least 18 years 
of age, provided they are liv
ing or studying within 110 
miles of Pittsburgh.
Designs for the project will 
be judged by Thomas Messer, 
director of the Solomon R. Gug
genheim Museum, New York. 
He will award a first prize of 
$5,000, and second and third 
prizes of $300 and $200 respec
tively.

Apathetic Image of CMU 
To be Rectified Soon
The total apathy image of 
Carnegie Mellon University stu
dents is being changed some
what by several groups involved 
in a variety of activities. The 
groups are aimed both at tak
ing the students into the real 
world and bringing the real 
world to the students.
One such program is a tutor
ing group operating out of the 
Center Avenue Y at Centre and 
Frances. Cyrus Irani and Pat 
Raab are the campus contracts 
for this social action group.
The project involves children, 
mainly from the Hill District 
ot Pittsburgh, who may have 
potential but are unable to ex
ercise this potential due to their 
environments. In this project, 
volunteers work both as tutors 
and big borthers to the children. 
Their goal is to stabilze the stu
dent both academically and so
cially.
At present, the tutoring func
tion is carried out at the Y, 
with hopes of expanded facil
ities. Tutors will be expected to 
spend approximately two hours 
a week with their students on a 
personal basis. Transportation 
will be provided. The students, 
who range in age from 11 to 14, 
will need help mainly in Eng
lish and Mathematics.
The Crib*
Another social action program 
with direct involvement is The 
Crib, a coffeehouse in the base
ment of the Wilkinsburg YWCA 
on Ross Street.
The Crib is the first project 
of its type in Wilkinsburg, and 
attracts students from all over 
the city. Campus contracts for 
the coffeehouse are Gene Papne
and Len Wanetik. The coffee
house operates on Saturady eve
nings from seven to 11. People 
are needed to talk with the stu
dents who attend the Saturday 
sessions. These students are all 
in the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and 
twelfth grades in high school.
The ability or willingness to 
communicate is essential in this 
project. The Wilkinsburg sturents who attend the Crib are 
interested in interacting with 
outsiders, and the C-MU stu
dents who already work on the 
project feel that there is room 
for volunteers of many differ
ent disciplines.
Undergraduate Action Group
A project which is to be based 
entirely on the campus is the 
proposed Undergraduate Action 
Group. The group will be work
ing on a problem of social im
portance which encompasses all 
of the disciplines on this cam
pus. At present, it is proposed 
that the undergraduates of 
C-MU design a school system 
lor the city of Pittsburgh.
The program will be the first 
of its sort at C-MU to involve 
social interaction and to be con
ceived, organized, and contralTre administrations has evinced 
led, entirely by undergraduates, 
the possibility of providing cred
it for undergraduate research 
for those who work on the pro
ject. The initial meeting for 
those interested in working on 
such a program will be Sunday, 
February 11, at 7 pm. A closed 
meeting with members of the 
community, Board of Education, 
faculty, and administration is to 
be held on February 12 at 7 pm

The Associated Press, accept

largely through the work of

the story was exposed as a

narcotics squad within the 
Pennsylvania State Police had

mittee to start an investigation

Senator, Benjamin Donolow, 
produced a young man in a 
mask who claimed to have taken 
200 acid (LSD) trips before 
dropping out of college. The 
Federal Drug Administration 
said it would investigate the 
possibility of prosecuting the 
persons who suplied LSD to the 
six students.
Then Dr. Yoder confessed and 
alledgedly requested psychiatric 
help. The Governor retracted,

EDITORIAL
REGISTRATION: A Technical Institution
As we sit here in the office glancing back over the first week 
of class, we gain an immense amount of relief from the fact that 
registration is over. Compared to registration, classes will be a 
breeze.
It is extremely confusing to us how a university with some 
of the most advanced computing machinery and some of the 
best programmers existent can make such a mess out of some
thing which is so amenable to computing equipment as registra
tion.
There lare few students, we would hasten to guess, who arrived 
ait their psychology, English, or history sections to find every
thing in order. We have received reports of one professor who 
simply locked the door and refused to permit any more students 
to enter the room. Others took more subtle approaches to the 
problem, but there were somesuch as seminar and required 
course professor who found themselves with twice as many stu
dents as they had planned for.
Those students who did manage to attain the distinction of 
choosing a section without an overflow wound up either in the 
wrong room, or, as happened to one of our staffers, in a class 
with one or two people in it.
Although class sizes have, by now, probably been adjusted, 
the students may very well find himself in a section with 35 or 
40 others. This does not lend will to individual learning or class 
discussion.
What we suggest to solve this problem is a rather simple ap
proach to registration. This is, preregistration. This could be accampiUisihed in a variety of ways. Students could either register 
iby mail or, as is done at many other universities they could see 
their advisors after midsemester grades and arrange their sched
ules then.
Preregiistration would provide several advantages. First, it 
would cut out the need for two registration days, which in turn 
could ease calendar problems. Second, it would relieve the depart
ment heads from a siege of students who arrive back at the de
partmental offices after having been booted out of a class because 
it was overloaded. Third, it would allow the English, history, psy
chology, and math departments to know how many sections of a 
class should be planned for. This would permit efficient alloca
tion of teachers.
Fourth, it would allow us to get down to business on the first 
day of class rather than running about balancing sections. This 
too, woulld ease calendar difficulties. Fifth, it would remove from 
two hours to two days of useless time from the students pocket, 
which he could then spend as he wished.
Sixth, it would permit a lightening of the load of the book 
Store at the beginning of the semester, for students would be 
awtaire of what classes the would be taking by as much as a month 
before the beginning of the semester.
Seventh, in line with the above, it would allow the book store 
to order more efficiently, as there would exist almost perfect in
formation concerning the number of students taking a course 
before the semester began. That would cut down on reorders and 
returns, as well as wasted space.
We feel that there are sufficient advantages to pre-registra
tion for us to look seriously into the matter. Such a self search 
could begin this semester, aind we have enough faith in our ad
ministration to believe that it will be able to devise a feasible sol
ution by next semester.
But, to paraphrase one professor when he was faced with 
60 students in one section, You have to realize that we are still a 
Technical Institution.

This is the status of the Cal
tech Smoke Control Project at 
the moment. We have submitted 
a proposal to the Rosenberg 
Foundation (San Francisco) for 
$26,000 to $33,000. We will re
ceive their answer in about 
three weeks.
We are having problems get
ting the students interested in 
the Project. They can already 
get credit for independent un
dergraduate research, so we 
cant attract then with that. We 
must depend on arousing their 
social consciences, on interest
ing them in learning how to run 
such a projection, on interdiscip
linary cooperation, and on work
ing with or looking at girls. 
They see the Project as a dream, 
but too ambitious and large to 
be real. However, all is not lost, 
since we do have some few very 
interested people who are work
ing on their ideas already.
We have interested people, 
but we need more Humanities 
people. At Carnegie this would 
be no problem. I think that we 
would have little need to im
port people as Caltech must do. 
This need to import is creating 
their biggest financial burden.
They have one more very in
teresting problem. The major
ity of the faculty likes the pro
ject. They see some limitations 
in it, but they think that the 
students should find these out 
themselves. They see it as an 
invaluable educational experi
ence. They realize that the pro
ject is saying that students can, 
to some degree, educate them
selves, and they are not afraid 
to admit that.
A small group of the faculty, 
unfortunately, has submitted a 
minority report. This means 
that the project must be exam
ined before the whole faculty 
instead of the smaller adhoc 
committee that was reviewing 
it before. This action could con
ceivably kill the project by de
laying it to death.
This minority doesnt like the 
independence of the project. 
They want to control it more, 
and dont like the fact that stu
dents want to educate themseles. This seems strange since 
Caltech has several courses in 
which the students may study 
anything they like (in one field, 
say English) in any way they 
choose.
One more objection to the 
project is that some think the 
project is a waste since we cant 
hope to do what the experts 
have not been able to do. They 
do not see the scope of the pro
ject. I hope that the faculty 
of Carnegie does not feel threat
ened by the project which will 
start at Cernegie. We might 
have trouble getting course credPATTERNS

it for the work at Carnegie, but 
hopefully, this will be our only 
problem.
I feel that the philosophy of 
this project is far more import
ant than the subject of air pol
lution. The project involves an 
educational experiment by stu
dents, community action on a 
project indigenous to the parti
cular community and campus, 
a erdepartmental cooperation, 
learning the principles and op
erations behind major commun
ity action through experience, 
applying science to society di
rectly, perhaps even an effort 
to unify the colleges of the na
tion, and anything else I realize 
later on.
The project is very complexIt arose from a feeling that 
the students should get involved 
in the community but werent 
or couldnt. It arose from disat
isfaction with the whole state 
of affairs.
I have sounded very pessimis
tic in this letter so let me try 
to give you my true feeling 
about the project. like all so
cial work, whether or not it 
fails, it must be tired.
I have been searching for 
some sort of involvement that 
our isolationist middle -class 
fears have looked down upon. 
I have made a major commit
ment, perhaps one of the big
gest of my life to this project. 
Now I must see the project 
through. I have doubts about 
its success, but not because its 
ideas are bad. Rather, like many 
students, its size frightens me. 
I think that the Caltech students 
who are involved in this pro
ject feel much the same way 
I do.
We cannot really say why we 
are involved; we cannot really 
say with perfect certainty what 
the project is trying to do, since 
we see it differenty almost every 
day, but we know that this is 
something we must do.
I have several ideas which I 
feel are important for any pro
ject which Carnegie starts. 
First, we know that our student 
government is partially noexistant. Let us not destroy our
selves by ignoring it any furth
er. We must do our best to make 
it active by forcing it to be ac
tive in a project. I dont kn:ow 
whether or not they will want 
to do this kind of thing, be
cause I dont know what kind 
of people are in the Student 
Government. Let us not splinter 
up our group and create 
jealousy or rivalry. We will 
need all the help we can get, 
and the Student Government has 
funds at hand that will be need
ed. It also has, I should hope, 
able organizers and administra
tors. Our project should have 
as one of its goals the strength
ening of the Student Govern
ment, and the possible unifica
tion of the student body. A 
project of this size and ambition 
requires patience with one an
other and cooperation, and a littie bending. I hope that we can 
do this. I am very excited al
ready about the possibilities 
that a project at Carnegie might 
present.
Housing can now be provided 
in Pasadena for all students 
who would like to participate 
in the Caltech project. Human
ities students are particularly 
needed. Applicants for student 
Research Associates should see 
Gordon Cohn or Tom Huff at 
Office of Religious Affairs, Skibo.

The American public thinks 
that everyone will serve at least

The Private War of Richard Nixon
by Len Wanetik
We received a letter recently from a group calling itself Youth 
for Nixon. The group, headed by a ohap named Ron McCoy, is in
tent upon mobilizing American college and high school stu
dents who support Nixons candidacy.
To that end, the Youth for Nixon outfit has established a 
Victory Program with Youth for Nixon Victory Teams com
posed of five or more students on campuses and in high schools.
The entire atmosphere here is one of a military campaign 
conducted by a besieged army. However, that seems to be consis
tent with Mr. Nixons past and present record. He has been beat
en so many times that he must feel besieged. And his statements 
concerning the war evidence a sort of militancy that is rare in
deeda wishy-washy militancy.
It is unfortunate that Mr. Nixons record hias shown him to 
be willing to chance his position at a moments notice for almost 
any reason. The Youth for Nixon group supports him for his 
experience, intelligence, and understanding. His experience is that 
of a loser, and acquiescer, and inactivist, and a very unskilled 
politician.
His basic intelligence is unassailable. But his applied intelli
gence is something else. His noncommital nature raises the ques
tion of his ability to function in the real world arena of interna
tional and domestic affairs. Surely, he can sell more scouring 
powder than anybody else, as was shown in his striking and 
classically performed forensic victory over Mr. Krushchev in the 
Kitchen Debate long ago in Moscow. Rut, as his Eisenhower Ad
ministration Manual told him, no moves is good moves. It is not 
clear thiat what we need now is a man with as much unadulter
ated JeMo as Mr. Nixon has.
Understanding is also in question here. Mr. Nixon* hias not 
shown us yet that he understands the basic nature and difficul
ties of the slums, Appalachia, the American Indian, the Asian, 
or anybody else you might think of except the straight, Middle 
Class society. And, the latter cannot be said for certain either.
In winding up their release, the Youth for Nixon people 
said that they would provide materials in support of Nixon in 
mock elections and conventions. We cannot agree more with this 
statement. Any election or convention with Nixon in it has got 
to be a mockery.
Student Publication Charges That 
Riot Commission Squelched Information
Washington(CPS) The Pres
idential commission studying 
last summers riots will deliver 
its final report several months 
ahead of its original deadline, 
with much of its research in
complete, because its research
ers findings didnt jibe with the 
kind of report the Administra
tion wanted.
AS IS, a newsletter on civil 
rights and community action ed
ited by Dave Steinberg of the 
National Student Association, 
says the commissions adminis
trative staff supressed much of 
what the researchers had found. 
As an example, AS IS says the 
researchers found in one city 
that there was no question that 
the policenot the Negroes 
were the rioters, bringing a 
bloodbath to an innocent Negro 
community.
AS IS says that, faced with 
these reports, the Administra
tive staff of the commission, in 
consultation with the White 
House, decided that this infor
mation had to be supressed be
cause:
There wuurd be too few 
kind words for local police, or 
for local political leaders.
The report could only sup
port an outcry for radically in
creased federal expenditure, 
while the President is cutting do
mestic programs to meet the ex
penses in the Vietnam war.
So the final deadline for the 
commission report was moved 
up. This is what happened, ac
cording to AS IS:
The executive director (of 
the Commission),, presumably 
in consulation with Governor 
Otto Kerner of Illinois, Chair
man of the Commission, inform
ed Commission members that 
they were to reach their conclu
sions sooner than expected, to 
meet the Presidents wishes, 
With the apparent assurance 
that research would continue be
yond the date of the Commise 
ions initial report, the member 
agreed to the Presidents re 
quest.
The administrative staff im 
mediately requested a final doc 
ument from the researchers in V 
matter of a few days. They pro 
duced a document of nearly 20C 
pages, only to be told that it 
was totally unacceptable. A new 
version was to be written 
around the Presidents specific 
requests for information on 
fourteen points. When the modi
fied report of the research staff 
still proved unacceptable, all 
documents were channeled 
through the administrative staff 
lawyers who were to describe 
the research findings in a polit
ically acceptable document 
which would then be presentee 
to the Commission members.
AS IS also said that New 
York Mayor John Lindsay was 
reportedly more than a little up 
set when he discovered that the 
Commissions work had been 
throttled behind the backs of its 
members.
Other organizations, such as a 
group at Johns Hopkins Uni
versity, which had been doing 
some of the work for the com
mission on contract, have taken 
over larger portions of the study 
on their own.. And Robert Gonot, author of a detailed and 
critical account of the Watts 
riot, has been asked to analyze 
the riots for the commission.
The major question is how 
much information will be avail
able to other researchers. AS IS 
says some of the most damning 
information may go into the Na
tional Archives for five years, 
where it will be available only 
to selected researchers. The 
commission staff may make in
formation available to some 
other groups, such as the Amer
ican Sociological Association, 
but observers have speculated 
that this merely means there 
will be two sets of reports.
Youth for Nixon 
Form Victory Team
Washington, Ron McCoy, Na
tional Chairman of Youth for 
Nixon, has announced plans to 
mobilize American college and 
high school students who sup
port Richard Nixon. McCoy, a 
sophomore at Arizona State Uni
versity and a past President of 
Boys Nation, stated, Richard 
Nixon speaks for our anxious 
generation anxious over the 
war in Vietnam, the urban cris
is, and the very quality of Amer
ican life. We are encouraged by 
the thousands of students who 
have already indicated their de
sire to speak up for him.
McCoy stressed the impor
tance of political participation 
by people under 25, half of our 
population, in the election ahead. 
It is clear that our generation 
will play a very large role in 
the political developments of 
1938. Richard Nixons experi
ence, intelligence, and under
standing mark him as the man 
for our times.
The principle activity of Youth 
for Nixon is the Program for 
Victory. Students will work to
gether or as individuals with 
out endless telephoning or ring
ing doorbells to recruit new sup
porters for Mr. Nixon. TheProfir a in for Victory will give each 
participant an opportunity to be 
of great assistance in the cam
paign and a chance to see the 
results of his efforts..
A major effort is also being 
made to establish Youth for 
Nixon Victory Teams at Amer
ican universities and high 
schools. Victory Teams will be 
the primary focus for group 
activity on the campus and can 
be composed of five or more 
students.
Additionally, Youth for Nixon 
will provide materials for those 
students supporting Mr. Nixon 
in Mock Political Conventions.
Special Bus To Run 
Between Campuses
The Division of Student Af
fairs has announced that an interoampus bus service will be 
instituted next month. The bus 
will run among Chatham, C-MU, 
Pitt, Mt. Mercy, and Duquesne.
The bus wil leave Chatham 
college at 10 am, noon, and 2 
pm. After a 45 minute run and 
a ten to 20 minute layover time, 
the bus will return from Du
quesne University at 11 am, 1 
pm, and 3 pm. Runs will be 
scheduled five days a week, 
holidays excepted.
Dean George K. Brown, in an
nouncing the service, stated 
that it would be provided on an 
experimental basis for 50 days 
beginning with the first Mon
day in March.
Port Authority Transit of Al
legheny County will provide the 
bus, which will be equipped 
with a special paint job and 
decorations. The cost to the stu
dent will be less than regular 
transit.
Proposed stops for the Car
negie - Mellon campus include 
Morewood Avenue, Margaret 
Morrison, and Frew Street at 
the Hunt Library.
In Dean Browns words, Now 
the library facilities of each in
stitution are really made avail
able to the students of the five 
participating colleges and uni
versities.
Exact cost to the student and 
stops at other universities have 
not yet been announced.
Literature, posters, buttons, 
and other campaign materials 
will be available for these 
events.
All students interested in 
more information regarding 
membership in Youth for Nixon 
should write Ron McCoy at 
1726 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20006.
Argentinian Poet 
Reads In Spanish
In a special presentation, the 
International Poetry Forum 
will present Jorge Luis Borges 
on Thursday, February 8, 1968, 
at 8:30 pm in the Carnegie Lec
ture Hall, Oakland.
Mr. Borges, an Argentinian, 
whom Time magazine recently 
noted as the greatest living 
writer in the Spanish language 
today and whom Book Week 
called unquestionably the most 
brilliant South American writ
ing today will read his work 
in Spanish, and Samuel Hazo 
will read the translations of An
thony Kerrigan, Robert Lima, 
Edwin Honig and others.
Jorge Luis Borges was born 
in 1899 in Buenos Aires. Edu
cated in Europe, he returned 
to Argentina in 1921, where he 
was one of the pioneers of the 
ultraista movement, the Spanish 
equivalent of German Expres
sionism. With Ricardo Guiraldes, he founded the literary 
journal, PROA, and took part 
in the modernist attack on out
worn literary standards. While 
convalescing from a severe ill
ness, he wrote the first of the 
'fictions which have since 
made him famous.
In 1961, he shared, with Sam
uel Beckett, the first award 
of the International Publishers 
Prize, and in that year publish
ed a collection of his work, 
Labryinths, and Ficeiones. The 
Ingram M e r r i 1 Foundation 
granted him its 1966 Annual Lit
erary Award for outstanding 
contribution to literature. Since 
the fall of Juan Peron, v/hom he 
vigorously opposed, he has been 
the Director of the National Li
brary of Argentina. The third 
book, A Personal Anthology, 
came out early this year. Mr. 
Borges is presently at Harvard 
University in the Department 
of Romance Languages and Lit
erature.
Tickets for this reading are 
a v a il a b 1 e at Kaufmanns, 
Hornes, Gimbels, and the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh Student 
Union. For additional informa
tion, call the Forum, 621-9893.
Professor Not 
To Be Janiior
Washington  (CPS) Gen. 
Lewis Hershey has decided that 
the Selective Service System can 
find a better occupation for a 
history professor than janitor.
Noel Brann, a 30-year-old Uni
versity of Maryland history pro
fessor, who turned in his draft 
card last October, was to be 
assigned to do janitorial work at 
the University of Kansas by his 
Reno, Nev. draft board. The 
board took action after receiving 
Branns draft card. Brann is a 
conscientious objector and was 
assigned civilian work instead 
of being inducted into the Army.
. Although Biiann had decided 
to report for the job rather 
than go to jail, he protested the 
kind of work to which he was 
being assigned. The news media 
got hold of the story, and soon 
people all over the country 
knew the Selective Service Sys
tem wanted to make a janitor 
out of a professor.
On Thursday, after a request 
from the director of the state 
appeals board, Hershey decid
ed that Branns draft board had 
violated the regulations, and
Duquesne University

Peace Corps To Use 
LST In Program
The Peace Corps, Director 
Jack Vaughn, announced the 
plans to use a new Language 
Saturation Technique, which 
it claims can touch a Volunteer 
to speak a foreign language in 
four weeks as well as many 
language majors do after four 
years of college.
The new method will step up 
an already intensive language 
training program for the 8,000 
trainees who will be prepared 
for Peace Corps service in 57 
nations during 1968.
Starting this spring, all 
trainees will be put through 
this method  dubbed LST 
for shortwhich calls for an 
around-the-clock language learn
ing environment for the first 
four weeks of their three-month 
training period.
Some Volunteers have to 
learn not only the official lan
guage of the country - say 
French in former French colo
nies of Africa, but also the 
tongue spoken by the people 
with whom they will work 
like Bobo, Twi and Tumbuka. 
Volunteers used to get about 
100 hours of language instruc
tion. Now they will get at least 
three times that. Language 
classes used to run from three 
to six hours a day, five days a 
week. Now they will get a min
imum of eight hours a day, 
six days a week, for the first 
four weeks.
After the first four weeks of 
the LST method, trainees will 
spread out the rest of their 
100-300 hours, with instructions 
about four hours a day. The 
rest of the time will be spent in 
developing technical skills and
knowledge of the new countrys 
culture.
But for the first four wees, 
said Alan K u 1 a, director of 
Peace Corps language training, 
we will focus entirely on lan
guage, not only during class, 
but outside the classroom, at 
meals, and during other activi
ties.
The Peace Corps tired out 
this saturation technique with 
eight training groups last sum
mer and fall and, Vaughn said, 
the results were sufficiently enAnyone interested in contri
buting to the Caltech project or 
in going to Pasadena to work 
should contact Gordy Cohn or 
Tom Huff at office of Religious 
Affairs.
A group of students working 
with the YM-YWCA will pro
duce an urban affairs discus
sion open to the public on March 
4 from 7:30-9 pm.
Speakers at the program will 
be Professor Leonard RappingEcnomics, Hiawatha Fountain 
from community NEED, David 
Lewisarchitecture, John RenaldoHistory (Moderator), Obdiah Sims,  - from Manchester 
House (North Side).
The focus of the program is 
to define the individuals con
trol on the political decision 
making process which affects 
his life.
Anyone interested in any of 
the above projects or in start
ing similar projects should eith
er contact the individuals named 
or write to Action c/o YM-WCA 
or the Tartan.
couraging for him to adopt the 
new method for all trainees 
this spring.
With the new method aimed 
at helping the Volunteers to fit 
into their new country even 
faster than before, Vaughn said: 
I expect theyll be able to hit 
the ground running when they 
get overseas.
Stever to Host 
Fireside, Feb. 18
International Firesides are 
now planned for the first part 
of second semester. The Fire
sides consist of ten to 12 stu
dents, some American, some 
foreign, gathering in a faculty 
home on a Sunday evening 
from about 7:30 to 10:00. Infor
mal conversation fill the eve
ning and it is a great opportun
ity to meet the faculty outside 
the formal classroom atmos
phere. Through the Firesides, 
Carnegie - Mellon Students also 
have the chance to meet fellow 
C-MU students, both American 
and Foreign.
Dr. Stevers home is the 
scene of the first International 
Fireside, Feb. 18. Professors 
Wolfenstein (Physics-, Goldstein 
(Psychology) and Angrist (So
ciology) follow on Feb. 25, 
March 3 and 10. With Dr. Stev
er and the professors, each Fire
side is sure to be rewarding.
If you are interested in at
tending a Fireside this semester 
(there will be four more later 
in the semester), please sign 
up at the table in the front of 
Baker Hall, Feb. 8 or 9 or con
tact the Y office, 57 Skibo as

Freaky Trip...
Photo by Jerry Siskind
TARTAN editor Len Wanetik expressed doubt about LSD story 
when interviewed by CBS reporter.
hoax was not a hoax, reduced 
the number of blinded students 
to two and announced that the 
college where the incident took 
place was Pitt (a charge denied 
by Pitt officials). One legisla
tor, Gerald Kaufman of Squirrel 
Hil, proposed over KDA-TV that 
politicians stay out of it. But 
another lawmaker, Lee Donald
son of Allison Park, suggested 
also via KDKAthat the hoax 
had the beneficial effect of alert
ing the public to the dangers 
of drugs. Editorials took the 
same line, and even the Press 
warned that, even though Dr. 
Oders story was false, it could 
indeed happen to anyone fool
ish enough to take an LSD 
trip.
THE FORGOTTEN ONES
Lost in the sea of rhetoric 
was any concern about the im
pact this comic opera might be 
having on the very people 
around whose heads the big 
winds blew: those college stu
dents who are using or might 
use LSD.
Historically youth has always 
been in rebellion against au
thority. Consider the impact on 
mistrustful youth of evidence 
that authority is ignorant, dis
honest and hysterically inaccu
rate. To trusting youth, this 
evidence must have come as a 
real shocker. It is obvious to 
college students that adults in 
control of the stale know noth
ing about LSD. It begins to look 
as if adult society has no com
munication with its youth.
I could not say with any de
gree of veracity jusi how many 
student users of LSD there are 
in the Pittsburgh area. If, how
ever, there is any college at 
which acid has not been used, 
I shoud be very surprised. I 
suspect that the incidence of 
LSD use on college campuses is 
very much more widespread 
than anyone cares to admit, or 
knows.
In the main, the young people 
who seek an answer through 
LSD are the progeny of law
yers, doctors, college professors, 
corporate executives, etc. They 
are usually white, middle or upper-middle class, with a fairly 
broad cultural exposure. Most 
of them have had some religious 
affiliation with a church or 
synagogue. Usually, nothing in 
the way of creature comforts 
has been denied them. In short, 
LSD usuage is a class problem. 
The higher the socio-economic 
background, the greater the in
cidence of LSD use.
the acid head, or potential 
acid head? Generally they 
stand high in their classes, have 
above average IQs, are hand
some, outgoing, outwardly at 
least poised, and sure of them
selves in group situations. Their 
interests do run to the artistic 
and literary rather than to the 
practical, but we must bear in 
mind that their family back
grounds have not required them 
to be particularly practical. A 
kid with 15 cashmere sweaters 
doesnt usually have to worry 
about repairing the plumbing; 
nor does she have to steal to get 
the money to buy LSD, which 
is fairy cheap anyhow  five 
dollars.
RESTLESS SEARHERS
These youths are totally dis
illusioned with materialism and 
status seeking. They do not see 
their parents as fulfilled or hap
py human beings. As a group 
and there are always execeptions  they are restlessly in 
search, questioning the why 
of everything. Quick to reject 
a because I say so answer, 
they are impatient of those who 
accept such answers. They re
fer to the acceptors as plastic 
people, unreal, unfeeling, lack
ing in deth, without meaning 
of life. It is very important to 
them to find a meaning for 
their existence and it is for this 
reason that they turn to LSD.
Drugs react differently on dif
ferent people. It is possible that 
six people at one time could 
be blinded after taking LSD by 
staring at the sun. It is not 
probable. Six people having 
drunk equal quantities of gin 
ordinarily do not behave iden
tically. Given enough people, 
enough time, it might be possi
ble to produce six identical re
actions simultaneously. The 
odds are against it.
In any event, such possibil
ities are no more a deterrent 
to the use of LSD than are the 
statistics on alcoholism to drink
ing.
To test this point I talked to 
several college students in the 
days following the Harrisburg 
hoax. Some have used LSD; 
some have not. These are some 
of their comments:
Cigarettes cause lung can
cer/
People get drunk and shoot 
each other.
Six people every day get 
crippled in car accidents, may
be more than six. Why don't 
they get excited about that?
Volu me uo6 76Nmblr1u16N me 5Gm uo6g Klb.u N66B wlbn
Whats to see except whats 
in your own head?
General Motors made cars 
that killed people, alot more 
than six. They probably still 
are making cars that kil peo
ple.
Drunks drive cars and kill 
kids.
Wh dont those people who 
scream about LSD scream about 
Dow Chemical and napalm?
They want to tell me I cant 
blow my mind. They dont care 
if the Vietcong blows off my 
head.
I wonder if we adults are fac
ing reality as honestly. If we 
are, why then do we continue 
to cling to values of a more 
comfortable time, before the 
Bomb, the riots, before Viet
nam? Should we not, in the 
light of the state of the world, 
be questioning why, if our 
values were so valid, the world 
has reached this state?
A DANGEROUS DRUG
I am opposed to the use of 
LSD. I believe it is a dangerous 
drug, with long term after ef
fects. I am against its legaliza
tion. Despite my opposition, I 
do not believe in treating as 
criminals people whose crime 
was a desire to find meaning for 
their existence in a world gone 
mad. Tightening control of LSD 
through the use of increased 
law enforcement will create re
bellion and drive more young 
people to try LSD as a symbol 
of that rebellion. Confining 
restless young people in prisons 
wil not only rob the country 
of their leadership but give rise 
to revolution and violence.
Before making any further 
decision about LSD, more re
search should be done on it. 
There are very few research 
projects being undertaken. What 
little research there has been 
inconclusive The chromosome 
studies would seem to indicate 
that LSD use during the first 
two months of pregnancy 
causes chromosome breakage 
similar to that found in certain 
types of lukemia and would 
also seem to point to the possi
bility of birth abnormalities. If 
these studies become conclusive, 
I believe that the possibility of 
birth defects will act as a de
terrent to LSD use by intelligent 
young people. It will not, of 
course, stop all of them. There 
wil be casualties as there are 
always casualties.
LONG TERM EFFECTS
Presently, my concern lies 
with the long term after effects 
of LSD use, about which little 
is said. It is my belief, on the 
basis of 14 months of observa
tion of people who have been 
LSD, that it has significant, al
though possibly not measurable, 
effects on the brain. If not on 
the brain, then on whatever 
part of the body controls the 
individuals value system. My 
unscientific hypothesis or more 
properly hunch is that LSD 
causes some sort of a short cir
cuit, similar in effect to those 
head injuries which result in 
amnesia. The results of this 
short circuit are profound.
I think two things occur simultaneuosly. The unconscious 
is somehow activated while as 
the same time secondary drives 
are lessened or destroyed. By 
secondary drives I mean those 
which are for the purpose of 
material success, power or pres
tige. These drives seem to be 
replaced by the more primary 
drives, the need for love, for 
warmth, for secure relation
ships. One young college student 
put it this way:
Im much stronger inside. I 
mean I know whats important 
now and what isnt. Im strong
er inside but Im weaker with 
people who dont know whats 
imortant.
It is this shift in values and 
loss of drive which causes so 
many users of LSD to drop 
out. They simply lose the de
sire to associate with anyone 
or anything that is contrary to 
their new view of what is im
portant. Consider this young 
mans statement in the light of 
the recent carnival in Harris
burg. How would he evaluate 
it?
That the way its always 
been, he said. This different 
set of values, which I believe 
may in part be drug-induced, is 
a partial explanation of the 
hippie culture. If society cant 
see whats important, then lets 
form our own society.
What is so dangerous about 
these long term after effects? 
In my opinion, consistant use 
of LSD renders the user virtual
ly powerless to defend himself 
in a materialistic culture. Se
cure in the knowledge that love 
is all, he walks into societys 
threshing machine. It is a sad 
truth that man must retain his 
ability to play some games in 
order to survive.
It would be very easy, if my 
hypothesis, is true, to destroy 
these people by treating them 
as criminals or psychotics. Do 
we really want to destroy them? 
Would not society benefit by 
preserving them?
NEED FOR SUPPORT
Anyone who has taken LSD 
has an increased need for mean 
ingful relationships and for 
greater emotional support. I be
lieve that relationships are 
needed which will help those 
who have taken LSD to re-define their values and to recog
nize a need for some of their 
previous defenses. It should not 
be impossible for us to provide 
these relationships.
It may well be that the prob
lem of re-defining values is the 
true cause of the LSD psychosis 
rather than the drug itself. The 
psychosis may begin with inept 
handling in hospital emergency 
rooms while the patient is not 
yet fully recovered from Ms 
trip. Perhaps it begins when 
the individual finds himself at
tempting to cope with hostility 
for the first time after his trip. 
It has been established that the 
LSD state renders a subject 
peculiarly sensitive to the feel
ings of others and highly sug
gestible to them.
In the case of Timothy Leary, 
I have wondered if he had been 
given support in channeling his 
energies whether his genius 
might not have been preserved. 
His rejection by his colleagues 
at a time when his use of LSD 
may have made him particular
ly vulnerable may have resulted 
in his present behavior. In oth
er words, not only the drug it
self, but the attitudes of those 
surrounding him and the trans
ference of their anxieties to 
him have resulted in his bizzarre 
confrontations with society.
If my conjectures are true 
and had been applied, it is pos
sible that Dr. Learys unique 
knowledge of LSD might have 
presented us with the solution 
of how to deal with it. Will 30 
years in jail return to society 
the capacity for original thought 
which Leary once possessed?
, olD6 aN6f t6lg lN l KlN6
in point because of his notoriety 
and because of his unusual role 
in our society. This should not 
be interpreted as an impassion
ed plea on his behalf, although 
I am sure that it will be in some 
quarters.
It is, however, a plea for a 
more enlightened attitude 
toward people who will inevit
ably try LSD, or who have tried 
it. It is not unrealisitc to con
sider the failure of past treat
ments before proposing new 
ones, it is unrealistic to look ob
jectively at the results of treat* 
ment or lack of it.
We know how to destroy 
these young people. We must 
determine how to save them.

Sign up for an interview at your placement officeeven if 
youre headed for graduate school or military service.
Maybe you think you need a technical background to work 
for us.
Not true.
Sure we need engineers and scientists. But we also need 
liberal arts and business majors. We'd like to talk with you even 
if you're in something as far alield as Music. Not that we'd 
hire you to analyze Bach fugues. But we might hire you to 
analyze problems as a computer programmer.
What you can do at IBM
The point is, our business isn't just selling computers.
It's solving problems. So if you have a logical mind, we need 
you to help our customers solve problems in such diverse areas
as government, business, law, education, medicine, science, 
the humanities.
Whatever your major, you can do a lot of good things at 
IBM. Change the world (maybe). Continue your education 
(certainly, through plans such as our Tuition Refund Program). 
And have a wide choice of places to work (we have over 300 
locations throughout the United States).
What to do next
We'll be on campus to interview for careers in Marketing, 
Computer Applications, Programming, Research, Design and 
Development. Manufacturing, Field Engineering, and Finance 
and Administration, If you can't make a campus interview, sent 
an outline of your interests and educational background to

Faculty Feature 
In 1968 Thistle
by Gordon Cohn
The staff of the 1968 Thistle 
is planning a new fromat which 
should encompass and give 
credit to the major segments of 
the university. In keeping with 
this goal, the staff would like 
to acknowledge the quality im
portance of the C-MU faculty.
The Thistle sees the faculty 
as being more than highly com
petent professionals. It sees them 
as interested in the individual 
creative development of the stu
dents, and strive to function as 
catalysts of student thought 
rather than attempt to mold 
students to duplicate the work 
that they and others have al
ready completed.
The Thistle would like to ack
nowledge the diverse accamplishments of all of the faculty 
members, but limited by space, 
and the need to cover other sig
nificant elements of the univers
ity, it has decided to select se 
veral professors whose work 
would give a representative 
sample of the generally high 
calibre of faculty work, and to 
do feature articles on those pro
fessors.
The Thistle would appreciate 
the suggestions of students and 
faculty on this matter. Sug
gestions concerning the type of 
coverage which would adequate
ly cover the scope the Thistle 
has set, and suggestions con
cerning representative faculty 
members may be submitted to 
Gordon Cohn, Editor, The This
tle, Room 53, Skibo.

Free University Open 
For New Topics
The Pittsburgh Free Univers
ity has published a flyer which 
explains how to help plan its 
Spring activities. The Free U. 
* is a voluntary body founded last 
year to enable Pittsburghers, 
whether in school or out, to 
participate in group studfes free 
of grades, degrees, or bureau
cracy. It makes no distinction 
between 'students and teach
ers. The idea is to practice how 
to learn and discover without 
the pressures of grades and 
diplomas. We think t h i s is 
worthwhile even if we never 
give ourselves diplomas or let
ters after our names, said 
David Bramball, member of the 
Curriculum Committee of the 
Free U.
The basis of the effort is the 
study-group, assembled around 
a topic. (Last fall there were 
' 22 groups, with topics ranging 
from Conscioisness Expansion 
to Alienation in Youth.) The 
Executive Committee of the 
Free U. finds meeting places 
for these groups, contacts ex
perts and consultants if re
quired, and pubishes a consol
idated schedule of group meet
ings, which will come out in 
/ mid-February. In contrast to the 
catalogues of regular univers
ities, which list teachers in 
search of students, the Free 
University thinks of its sched
ule as listing students and topics 
in search of teachers, who are 
also students.

Frosh Cabinet Serves 
CMU in Various Ways
The Freshman Cabinet, com
posed of about thirty freshmen, 
working under the direction oi 
Tom Huff, Y-director, and Mitch 
Nupgent, junior sculpture ma
jor, is striving to relieve the 
problems of Skibo and its lack 
of proper facilities.
The Cabinet has already fur
nished several services to the 
school. They were responsible 
for the cheering section at the 
Homecoming football game in 
October. They also handled the 
sensitivity T-group, which is a 
gathering of students who learn 
about themselves through frank 
and intensive discussions of 
their personalities and the im
pression they make on others. 
The members conducted tours of 
the campus for interested high 
school students sent by their 
local Y associations. For the 
Future, the Cabinet has created 
a committee to investigate the 
possibility of having an ice skat
ing rink on campus.
Anyone who is ointersted in 
joining the Cabinet or contrib
uting suggestions should con
tact Gerry Glacer, Box No. 764.
will be stimulated to form other 
groups on other topics. These 
new groups will also go into 
the February schedule.

Student Help Needed 
for SYS Plays
Scotch n Soda, the all-university drama club is preparing to 
strat stage and set construction 
for their annual production. 
Technical Director Richard Juram announced Friday that pre
liminary plans have been de
veloped and many final draw
ings have been finished. Con
struction work is expected to 
start on Saturday, February 10. 
Many materials are already on 
hand, and tools and equipment 
are being assembled for the 
coming drive.
TWO SHOWS
S n S, in a departure from 
the usual practice of putting on 
a full length show, will put on 
2 one-act musicals this year. Juram noted that putting on two 
diverse shows makes designing 
settings quite tricky. Bert Cottine and Mark Pirolo, the shiowis 
scene designers, have come up 
with all kinds of interesting 
techniques for setting the two 
productions. Two-faced flats, 
drops, and projections will all be 
utilized.
Don Earl, just back from a 
semesters work-study program 
at Thyrone Guthrie Theatre, 
will be Sn Ss lighting design
er. Arnie Levine is well along 
designing the costumes. Both 
costuming and lighting are more 
of a challenge with two backto-back shows, they agreed.
Wants People
With much of the designing 
completed, all that remains is 
the actual construction, painting, 
and hanging of lights. Juram 
pointed with pride to the list 
of over 30 people who have 
signed up so far to do such 
work. People who have already 
signed up to do such work will 
get a note in the mail detailing 
our schedule, he said. Of 
course, anyone who has not yet 
expressed interest and wants to 
can tell any S n S member or 
leave me a note on the S n S 
bulletin board. He emphasized 
that no particular skills are re
quired and that Were always 
happy to have anybody who 
wants to help. He went on to 
observe that everybody has a 
good time and we do get a lot 
of work done. Juram thinks 
Scotch N Soda plays an impor
tant part in the University as it 
draws together students from all 
departments and classes and 
sets them to work on a common 
goal.
The final scripts and scores 
for the two shows have been 
completed and rehearsals are 
now underway. The shows will 
open Friday, April 26 and play 
through Spring Carnival..
Psychedelic Dance
(Continued from Page 1) 
Rebecca and the Sunnybrook 
Farmers, the Underground In

fluid projectors, (the most 
avant-garde art form, using liv
ing colors and fluids to create 
dynamic, changeable images), 
three slide projectors for ab
stract and geometric shapes, 
and numerous strobe lights.
The Light show and Dance 
will be held at 8:00, in the Skibo

I The Graduate
I A Blistering Version of 
I Pope And Circumstance
Ig Umbg tly6bK6
Director Mike Nichols, producer Lawrence Turman and screenI writer Buck Henry have combined creative forces to turn out not
 only one of the best films of 67, but a film that is a classic in
 its own time. I fail to mention Calder Willingham as co-writer
 with Henry because his contribution to the screenplay was remiected by Nichols long before filming and Henrys remained alone. 
The film is The Graduate, an Embassy Pictures-Joseph Levine
 presentation.
The Graduate is a serio (almost tragic) comedy. Benjamin
 has just graduated from college and finds himself muddled, searchI ing and, throughout the picture, clinging to relationships and 
I people he later rejects. The irony in the ending is that he cannot 
I see the forest for the trees and seemingly ends up as much In 
I the dark as before.
When he arrives home his parents give him a terrible posh, 
almost typical partywith only their friends. His fathers law 
partners wife (Anne Bancroft) asks Benjamin to drive her home, 
in his new Alfa-Romeo, which he does. Once alone with her in 
the house she proceeds to try and seduce him; unsuocessfuly. He 
is frightened, doubtful and generally shook up about the incident. 
Nevertheless, he takes advantage of her invitation at a later 
date, and they have an affair over the summer. Where the conflict 
enters is when her daughter (Katherine Ross) comes home from 
Berkely and the husband urges Benjamin to take her out. He does 
and quickly discovers that she is the girl for him. But she soon 
learns of the affair and ceases her relationship with him. He trails 
her back up to Berkely watching her from a distance and now 
and then attempting to communicate with her.
Eventually she is pressured by her father, who also learns 
of the affair, to marry a young, dull medical student. On learning 
of the intended marriage, Benjamin makes a desperate attempt 
and successfully interrupts the wedding. Just as she is about to 
say "I do, he appears banging on the glass in the balcony of 
the church screaming her name. She turns and, realizing what is 
. happening, runs to him. He wards off their pursuers by grabbing 
large cross and swinging it as they come near them. They do 
end up together but the happiness in their lives is doubtfuL
Dustin Hoffman makes an impressive screen debut and por
trays Benjamin superbly. His remarkable subtlety and occasional 
underplaying of certain scenes add to the craftsmanship of his 
performance. After doing two off-Broadway stints in EH! and 
Harry, Noon and Night, Nichols tested and chase him for the 
part. He is brilliant and a certain competitor for the Oscar this 
year.
K Anne Bancroft is equally good. She plays the woman on the 
makenot to the hilt (which would be a mistake)but with a 
compelling force and convincing believability. There is a scene be
tween her and Benjamin in a hotel room when they are about to 
go to bed. He asks her if: Just this once couldnt we talk first? 
What about? she replies. Well, I dont know. How about art? 
she asks. Alrightwhich type of art do you like best? Benjamin 
asks. She answers: I dont know anything about art. Well what 
did you major in at college? Art, she replies. This may appear 
funny, but it is in the strongest sense a mournful cry. She is as 
| sad a person as he is. Knowing little or nothing about nothing. 
The scene is almost ten minutes long and is beautifully played. 
Katherine Ross does well with her assignment and is believa w 
as the empty, surface personality that dominates her role.
Nichols has firmly established himself as one of the leading 
creators in both theatre and film mediums. He has made a commit
ment to the work and has stuck by that commitment. Benjamin 
appears as a sort of moth caught in self-frustration. Many scenes 
emphasize this and are done behind glass or with water as a bar!? rier. It has been done with much simplicity and little coanmeraalfem. That in many ways is the epitome of great film making. To 
be unobstrusive, yet powerful is a difficult task and The Graduate 
is of that quality.
Alice Ghostley and Marian Lome are hilarious in a brief seg
ment. William Daniels is also a tremendous asset to the film. Simon 
and Garfunkel have provided one of the best soundtracks of the 
year. The music is consistently good and well employed. It seems 
t that many critics have misunderstood the ending of The Graduate. 
They fill that it is a traditionally easy way out and trite happy 
ending. I think that though Benjamin certainly finds what he has 
been after, that search has been futile and he is in fact ending up 
with little. NEXT WEEK: Wait Until Dark.. The Graduate opens 
today at the Forum in Squirrel Hill.

A street gang in north Philadephia became a productive 
film-making company last year. 
Their first film, The Jungle, 
will be shown here Wednesday, 
February 14th at 7:00 pm in 
the Wherrett Room. Two mem
bers of the gang will accompany 
The Jungle and will talk about 
the film and their gang after
wards.
The group, the 12th and Ox
ford Streets Gang made their 
first film about a subject they 
know intimately and vividly: 
survival in the slums of Phila
delphia. A1 aspects of the film 
were done by gang members 
themselves as they told their 
own story.
The project was initially finnanced by the Brooks Founda
tion of California as an educa
tion experience for male Negro 
teenage high school dropouts. 
The roject and the film both 
proved so successful that the 
gang is continuing to function 
as a film-making group  one 
geared specifically to involving 
dropouts in productive, exressive operations. The group thus 
also serves to convey to others 
the nature of urban life and 
gang cultures in America today.
The showing of the film, 
sponsored by the Psychology 
Deartment and the YM-YWCA, 
is open to the whole university 
community.

by Tom Cowan
It has long been contemplated 
by the residents of this college 
community that there is some
thing wrong at C-MU. Varying 
from a general pesemistic claim 
of hopeless apathy, to specific 
accusations of blame, the prob
lem has been futilely verbal
ized between departments, col
leges, students organizations, 
and administrations for years.
In the past, some faculty 
groups have introduced new aca
demic programs into the cur
riculum: among others, the
math, physics and humanaties 
have a cooperative degree pro
gram. However, without nega
ting the obvious positive side 
effects, it should be realized 
that these programs didnt of
fer anything new, but rather 
only allowed students with dual 
interests to utilize the already 
existing academic facilities. And 
judging from the talk circles, 
the probem still seems to exist.
The problem in solving 
C-MUs problems was that there 
was never any risk taken, con
sequently there was never any
thing gained. Departments 
were afraid to scrap their stan
dard working courses for a po
tentially innovative learning ex
perience.
. .The gutty approach is that
one department has decided to 
take the risk. Theyve decided 
to radically alter one of their 
standard courses.
The Mechanical Engineering 
Department has only one design course. A senior year, sec
ond semester, 11 unit slot which 
in the past has designed such 
wonderous things as paer air
planes, small learning towers 
of Pisa, parachutes, put-put 
boats, and other insignificant 
structures. The motivation used 
in the course was individual 
competition. Thus at graduation 
time, the Mech E. department 
had approximately 60 bath tub 
tinker toys, which upon their 
return, for lack of an alterna
tive, were shown to prospective 
employers as a demonstration 
of the students creativeness.
In summary, the course fail
ed to inspire creativity, group 
cooperation or many sense of 
realism in the student, all of 
which are essential element to 
design.
However, in status quo terms, 
the course did work. Teachers 
enjoyed it with spring time hu
mor, and students had a eu
phoria learning out of windows 
watching their paper planes 
nose dive uon their peers.
What the Mech. E, Depart
ment has done in an effort to 
revamp their whole engineer
ing program is to effectively 
scrap the old design course. In 
its place theyre substituting an 
experimental program. This 
new design course, by its very 
mature, has a high probability 
of failure. But, if successful, it 
is sure to guide the department 
in further innovative programs.
Specifically, each of the three
What You Dont Know About 
The Draft Law... Could Kill You!
The draft commands compliance to its rules without 
telling everyone concerned what all those rules are. It is 
entitled to compliance but not through ignorance of those 
affected. We discovered how little is known about the 
draft law and how difficult it is to find any information and 
decided something had to be done. We have spent months 
researching the law and have found a lot of facts that are 
not generally known outside the Selective Service Head
quarters.
1. MANY persons are NOT EVEN REQUIRED TO REGIS
TER for the draft.
2. If you are not required to register and volunteer, 
you will be registered WITHOUT BEING TOLD YOU DO NOT 
HAVE TO REGISTER.
3. Few persons have seen the draft law.
4. The government does not give out copies of the 
law to the public.
5. A "GLASSBLOWER" is a "critical occupation" sub
ject to deferment, there are dozens of other "critical occu
pations."
6. There are two "services" which FULFILL your mili
tary obligation besides the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Mar
ines and the Air Force.
7. If you are scheduled for induction, there are many 
postponements available.
8. It is possible to appeal classifications to the Presi
dent.
9. There are 22 OTHER classifications available be
sides "1A."
10. The American Council On Education says: "Enroll
ment in the first two years of graduate and professional 
schools next fall will be limited to women, veterans, men 
physically disqualified and those over the age of 25."
11. Beginning in July, 1968, almost 75% of all men 
inducted by Selection Service will be college graduates.

senior Mech E. sections have 
been assigned one problem to 
be worked on jointly by the 
student members of each sec
tion. The problems choosen actuaiy need a solution and one in f 
particular has social ramifica
tions.
Section A has been given the 
task of designing a completely 
new undergraduate curriculum 
for the Mechanical Engineering 
Department. The plan is to 
come up with a workable struc
ture that can be ultimately im
plemented into the present sys^ 
tem.
Section B will investigate un
tried applications of abrasive 
machine products and innova
tive uses of the abrassive ma
chining industry. The work is 
sponsored by an association of 
various abrassive machinery 
manufacturers.
Section Cs project is for the 
Transportation Research Insti* 
tute: a feasibility study for a  
medium range, aerodynamic 
transport vehicle. The class has 
approximately five thousand 
dollars to spend on gathering of 
information, model construction, 
publications, and wind tunnel 
tests in Akron, Ohio. A final 
report is to be submitted to 
TRI, and if Feasibe, addition5 
al funds will be secured by TRI 
for a detailed design project 
next Fall. *)
All the problems entail group 
effort, innovative approaches, j 
and are oriented towards exist
ing and .significant problems.
Whether it will succeed or 
not cannot now be determined.
What is certain is that from the j 
departments innovative and 
daring approach to education 
will come sufficient feedback 
as to whether there is any im
mediate hope of unapathizing 
the present situation. The im
mediate question Is, can CMU 
students be encouraged to be 
self-motivated individuals? The 
long range question: can C-MU 
students be mde more aware 
of the overwhelming problems 
now confronting the American 
society?

This night of basketball is the 
kickoff or tipoff for Greek Week 
and is sponsored by the Panhellenic Council and The Council 
Of Fraternity Presidents. All 
proceeds will go to Childrens 
I Hospital here in Pittsburgh.
^Tickets will be sold at the door.
The Steelers lost twice in 
regular season play to the 
Browns last fall and those los
ses have not been forgotten. The 
last time the Browns met the 
Steelers in basketball was a 
few years ago in Erie, Pa. and 
the game was never finished.
Jimmy Brown and Red Mack 
^started a scuffle which result
ed in a fight that brought in 
city police. Incidentally both 
teams will average over 235 
pounds.
This night proves to be a 
basketball fans bonanza as 
there are two other big games 
also being played before the 
Brown-Steelers game. The night 
begins at 7:30 with the I.M. 
Championship basketball game. 
Following that game the I.M. 
awards will be presented.
The second game of the night 
just might be the funniest as 
the KQV disc Jockeys, led by 
Chuck Brinkman and Dave 
Scott, play the Allegheny Airline 
Stewardesses. KQV will be out 
to redeem themselves after a 
^humiliating loss to the United 
Airline Stewardesses at the 
Civic Arena in January.
The third and final game will 
probably be the roughest and 
most grueling basketball game 
in the history of Skibo gym.

Defensive BackSteelers
The Cleveland Browns, led by 
6 5 270 pound Frank Parker, 
will battle the Pittsburgh Steel
ers, who will have the likes 
of LLoyd Voss and Jim Butler.
It took a lot of convincing to 
pursuade Baldy Regan, the 
Steeler Basketball manager, to 
permit the Steelers to play the 
Browns. Usually games like this 
are not scheduled for rather 
obvious reasons. However, when 
Bill Nelson and Paul Martha 
were informed of the pending 
game they pressured Baldy un
til he finally gave in.
The Cleveland Browns also 
want to play in this game. Frank 
Parker is coming from Okla
homa to play. Ross Fichner, Jim 
Houston, Jim Kanicki, and Ernie 
Kellerman all broke speaking 
engagements to be able to play 
in the game. The Browns will 
not say if Leroy Kelly will be 
here or not.
Since the game was set up 
some interesting side events 
have taken place. Paul Martha, 
possibly one of the smallest 
Steelers, was forbidden to play 
by Baldy Regan. Baldy felt that 
Paul would be in danger without 
padding. However, Ben McGee 
told Baldy something like, You 
better let Paul play. Hes ready 
for this one. If one of those $0&* 
/*%*?*? Browns touches him 
Ill break his &$?/%* neck! 
So Paul Martha will be playing. 
Baldy also announced that two 
Steelers will be flying in from 
California to play in the game. 
Bob Jeter, a member of the 
Green Bay Packers and one who 
usually plays on the Steelers 
Basketball team, will not be al
lowed to pay in this game by 
order of Nick Costello, the man
ager of the Cleveland Browns 
basketball team. Baldy, in turn 
made it known that he would 
not allow either Mike Lucci of 
the Detroit Lions or Vince Cos
tello now of the New York Gi
ants, both of whom usually play 
for the Browns basketball team, 
to play..

Back on January 10, CMU 
trounced St. Vincent 77-58. The 
TARTANS were plaqued by 
turnovers and were poorly or
ganized in the first half but led 
35-31 because St. Vincent was 
worse. Play was sharper in the 
second half and St. Vincent pul
led even 43-43. However, Mark 
Lang, who was able to score 
only one field goal in the first 
half, begun to take charge and 
pump in shots from all over the 
court. CMU pulled ahead by ten 
points and coasted the rest of 
the way. The TARTANS 3-2 
zone proved effective in limit
ing St. Vincent to long outside 
shots, while CMU continued to 
control the boards. Snow Mitch
ell played an impressive second 
half as he kept the team moving.
Lang scored 19 with 19 rebounds 
and Hummel chipped in 17 
points and 15 rebounds.

The TARTANS followed up 
this victory with a 71-65 win

Lang scored 25 and led the team

year rivalry. But the Panthers 
were having troubles this sea
son and compiled only a 4-7 
record up to this game. The

were marked by a large number 
of offensive fouls and deliberate 
play as Pitt took a 6-3 lead. The

points respectively as CMUs

The TARTANS entered the

As the successful production of The Subject Was Roses closes 
Feb. 18, a new production filled with humor, compassion and poetry 
follows in the form of A Delicate Balance, Edward Albees finelydrawn drama.
Often regarded as Albees best and most mature play, A Deli
cate Balance concerns an affluent couple, Agnes and Tobias, who 
find that the delicate balance that they have been able to maintain 
in their lives together is threatened by a triple invasion of their 
tense, but carefully balanced household.
Two of the intruders are a neighboring couple, Harry and 
Edna, their best friends for 40 years have come to ask hospital
ity indefinitely, because they have been seized with an indefinable 
anxiety, which Albee implies is due to sudden realization of empti
ness in their lives.
The third intruder is the daughter, Julia, who has returned 
home after her fourth marriage fails. She brings with her hysteria 
and anxiety, too.
Another part of this apple-cart is the sister, Claire, who is an 
enjoyable sharp-witted alcoholic.
Teamed up in the starring roles are Scottie McGregor and 
James Noble, the same couple that shared the spotlight in the Play 
house production of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? two seasons 
ago.

olume6m7N KBuV br1 11) 
congress that it is meant to 
preclude egg-throwing, rock 
hurling, or tumult designed to 
drown out that the speaker is 
saying.
Student role in running the 
universityThis is very vague, 
stating only that the students 
role should be clearly defined. 
It is probably the most mini
mal section of the document.
Student PressThe statement 
encourages financially indepen
dent campus newspapers and 
calls for editorial freedom and 
due process in firing edtors. 
But it also offers two escape 
caluses. One says that the uni
versity may have to bear legal 
responsibility for a student 
publication when it is not finan
cially autonomous. The other 
says freedom entails corallary 
responsibilities to be governed 
by the canons of responsible 
journalism, such as the avoid
ance of libel, indecency, undocu
mented allegations, attacks on 
personal integrity, and tech
niques of harassment and innu
endo. While not objectionable 
in themselves, interpretation of 
canons of responsible journal
ism have been used by many 
college presidents to justify cen
sorship of student publications.
Freedom off-campusThough 
it says universities should pro
vide information about legal 
rights and counsel to students 
who are arrested, this section 
otherwise follows up strong 
statements of rights with vague 
escape clauses.
It says that students should 
be permitted to exercise the 
rights of citizenship but follows 
that up with as members of 
the academic community, they 
are subject to the obligations 
which accrue to them by virtue 
of this membership. Schwartz 
says the latter statement may 
be used to limit off-campus free
dom.
On the key issue of university 
punishment of law-breaking stu
dentsdouble jeopardy  the 
statement says institutional 
authority should never be used 
merely to duplicate the function 
of general laws, but then of
fers as escape clause: Only 
where the institutions interests 
as an academic community are 
distinct and clearly involved, 
should the special authority of 
the institution be asserted. Ex
actly when that happens is un
clear.
Due process in disciplinary 
proceedingsThis is the longest 
and most explicit section of the 
statement. It guarantees many 
student rights including: the 
right to have a statement of the 
charges against him, the oppor
tunity for refutation of the 
cahrges, orderly deliberation of 
those charges, and the right to 
appeal. Also included are stu
dent participation in formulating 
rules, the right of a student not 
to have his rooms searched by 
university officials without his 
consent (although theer is an 
escape clause: under extreme 
emergency circumstances), and 
the right of students to remain 
in school while they await dis
ciplinary action.
But this section also has its 
vague escape clause: educa
tional institutions have a duty 
and corollary disciplinary pow
ers to protect their educational 
purpose through the setting of 
standards of scholarship and con
duct . . . Even Schwartz, gen
erally a strong proponent of the 
statement, calls this section ob
jectionable and adds, "the eduGENERAL

Come Back Baby
The film Come Back Baby
that was made here last year 
by David Greene and Terry 
Riebling has been accepted 
for distribution by the Film 
Makers Co-Op in New York. 
Mr. Greene and Mr. Riebling,
cational mission of institutions 
has been used to justify too 
many idiotic rules to mention 
here.
Despite all these weaknesses, 
Schwartz views the statement 
as a significant step forward, 
considering the groups in
volved. That is probably true. 
But, given these weaknes es, en
forcement and interpretation be
come especially important, and 
students will have to be watchfull to see that the document 
is not used to excuse violations 
of the freedoms it is intended 
to insure.
It is hoped that on those cam
puses where students want to 
see the Joint Statement adopt
ed, they will emphasize that, 
since it includes only minimal 
student rights, that the college 
should adopt it in full and per
haps do a little more.
Dean Brown has recently is
sued his draft of the academic 
freedoms for C-MU students 
and faculty printed in the Feb.
7 Tartan. He hopes that through 
student and faculty support, it 
will become a reality.

Wednesday, February 7, 1968-THE TARTAN-Page 17
In and Around Pittsburgh
olume6m7N KBuV br1 20) 
atre now has two plays running in repertory: USA by John Dos 
Passos, and The Rehearsal, by Jean Anouilh.
USA is a bitter sweet reminiscense of an era that is now 
only history but was once known as the Golden Twenties. It 
spans the turn of the century through the depression. There are
* several characters who thread their way through this 29 year 
period and the audience follows their growth, struggle for suc
cess, achievement, and at times, their death. It surrounds these 
characters with the major events and personalities of the parti
cular era; everything that either played an important part of their 
lives or was a part of their environment. USA is a contemporary 
play in that the situations and experiences of the characters have 
plagued mankind since the dawn of time. USA incorporates a 
mixed-media approach to theatre wherein motion picture techni
ques, slide projections, choreography and theatrical staging are 
utilized to intensify dramatic effect of this moving adaptation of 
| the novel by John Dos Passos.
The Rehearsal iis a witty and engrossing black comedy writ
ten by Jean Anouilh. The play revolves around the modem day 
jet-set society of Paris. The play is set in the summer chateau 
of Ferbroques and a costume ball is being planned to wile away 
the boredom of a French summer. The typical French nuances of 
husband and wife, lover and mistress are inherent in this play 
and attitudes of to each his own with no hoildis bared prevail 
throughout. A 15th Century play is being rehearsed to entertain 
the guests. The plot begins when the host falls in love with the
I governess who is caring for twelve adopted orphans. In order to 
maintain the class structure, it is necessary to destroy the love 
between Tiger, the host, and Lucille, the governess. The play asks, 
Can one destroy innocence without destroying ones self?
The Open Stage is located atop Mt. Washington at 233 Shiloh 
St. For reservations and information, phone 481-9200.

Student Power Should Aim 
To Remold Universities and Society
LETTERS
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.  
Student activists are in sharp 
disagreement with themselves 
and Fellows of the Center for 
the Study of Democratic Insti
tutions about the nature and 
tactics of student power.
But in a recent Center sem
inar here, the student activists 
agreed their aim should be to 
turn both the American uni
versity and society away from 
what they see as hypocrisy, 
economic exploitation and im
perialism and towards meaning
ful citizen-articipation in politi
cal and social life.
Views of the students and 
Center Fellows, frequently at 
odds, are contained in a 64-page 
Occasional Paper, Students and 
Society, published by the Cen
ter and edited by W. H. Ferry, 
a Center Vice-President.
The three-day seminar was 
organized by four university 
students who had spent three 
months at the Center as Junior 
Fellows: Jeffrey Elman of Har
vard, Frederick Richman of New 
York University, Stephen Saltonstall of Yale University, and 
Daniel Sisson of Claremont Col
lege.
The conference was held be
cause Center Fellows wanted 
to hear first-hand the views of 
student activists, one of whose 
strongest complaints is that the 
older generation is not listen
ing to them
The Center is a private, non
profit educational institution, lo
cated here, devoted to clarifica
tion through dialogue of basic 
issues confronting a democratic 
society. Its corporate entity is 
the Fund for the Republic, Inc. 
Its President is Robert M. Hut
chins, former President of the 
University of Chicago.
Center Occasional Papers com
prise a new series of Centerpublications, issued at least five 
times a year, for members ofthe 
Center. They appear on alternate 
months to the new Center Maga
zine, also a membership publica
tion.
Michael Lerner of the Univers
ity of California at Berkeley 
echoed the views of many of 
the students when he question
ed the possibility of changing 
the university without also, and 
possibly first, changing society.
There is a plausibility, said 
Lerner in talking about the 
university as a means for chang
ing the society. But precisely 
because its a crucial institution 
they wil not let you change it.
We start enunciating our 
ideals about the life of the 
mind and critical intelligence 
and democratic control of the 
university and getting the 
kinds of educational experiences 
that are relevant to our inter
pretation of life, and dealing 
with the major problems, and 
relating to ones fellow man, 
said Lerner.
But these are exactly the 
problems the university will not 
allow you to deal with, he add
ed.
Frank Bardacke, a graduate 
student at the University of 
California, said that the issue 
is what happens to the life of 
the mind in the American uni
versity.
That life can be destroyed, he 
said, by removing students from 
men with ideas, making the 
university a place which is in
hospitable to a learned man, a 
man who has some kind of vis
ion of unified knowledge and is
trying to make knowledge rele
vant to his life.
It is impossible, said Bard
acke, for (the learned man) to 
be in the university because he 
isnt a good enough specialist. 
So, university students come in
to contact instead with techni
cians, with intellectual techni
cians who are uninspiring and 
dullno student can have any 
respect for them  -  Most of us 
go through college never meet
ing a man we would wtant to 
spend more thian one year with.
Bruce Levine of Valley Stream 
High School, New York, said 
that the value of student acti
vism is not that one can hope 
to change either the university 
or society, but that by parti
cipating in movements (the stu
dent) can radicalize experience 
and may change his outlook on 
society as a whole.
John Blood, student body 
president at Indiana University, 
said the real job is to make 
the middle-class students politi
cal .. . We have to show them 
all the inconsistencies and con
tradictions and hypocrisies in 
our society . . . Wed better face 
the fact that we have a genera
tion of students who are not so 
politically active as economically 
motivated. Berkeley is a hotbed 
of revolt and Harvard may be. 
But how about Slippery Rock 
State College, how about Valley 
State College, how about Bethel 
College? This is where the ma
jority of students are.
Saltonstall, however, question
ed whether the aim of student 
activist should be to convert all 
students to radical activism.
Radical reform has never 
been accomplished by changing 
everyones mind. Only one-third 
of Americans started the Revolu
tion. We dont have to bother 
with the folks in the suburbs 
who want three cars . . . What 
we should do is be the instru
ments of change. I think we 
have enough people now. It is 
worthless to try to radicalize 
every student. It wil never hap
pen.
Devereaux Kennedy, student 
body president at Washington 
University, St. Louis, said the 
student power movement should 
line itself up with the Third 
World forces and the Negro re
bellion rather than with the 
American ruling class.
Im going to say loudly and 
explicity what I mean by revo
lution, Kennedy said. What I 
mean by revolution is overthrow
ing the American government 
and American imperialism and 
installing some sort of decen
tralized power in this country.
If this meant university 
whites supplying guns and 
money to rebellious Negroes, 
said Devereaux, he would be in 
favor of that. Meanwhile, stu
dent activist can give people 
a vision of something other than 
what they have now. They can 
give them a vision of people 
living as whole men, not as 
engineers for Monsanto or Mc
xmbb6rr Aircraft.
But Mary Quinn of Mount 
Mercy College, Pittsburgh, ob
jected. We talk about the 
mind, she said, but this is 
where its all gotten us. We 
cant talk any more; we have 
to go around and take on guns. 
This is really the saddest thing 
in this society, that we cant 
really be like men    I cant

For CMU Students
(Continued From Page 2)
Editor, The Tartan:
Because of growing concern 
among both the administrative
and the student body about the 
number of outsiders who make 
Uc,e of the Campus Activities Cen
ter, the staff at Skibo was in
structed last semester to change 
all posted signs to indicate that 
the facilities were served for the 
use of the CMU personnel. The 
staff at Skibo has also been in
structed to request identification 
when persons in the building are 
not recognized as University per
sonnel. It is important that Skibo 
not become a neighborhood hang
out for teenagers and other non
college personnel. In order to pre
serve the use of the building for 
Carnegie students and staff, desk 
attendants and Security will from 
time to time ask for identification 
and will ask non-university per
sonnel to leave.
We hope that students will un 
derstand the purpose of this re
quest for identification and will 
co-operate when asked to provide 
it.

Coordinator, Student Activities.

talk you into it and so Im go
ing to stick a gun in your ribs 
and youre going to have to 
comply. Where has the mind 
gone?
Stanley Wise, executive sec
retary of the Student Nonvio
lent Coordinating Committee, 
Atlanta, said revolutions are 
bloody, theyre destructive, they 
seek to destroy. There are very 
few people here who would ever 
be involved in (that kind of) 
revolutionary activity.
Wise distinguished between 
three types of revolutionary ac
tion: rampant guerrilla action, 
highly controlled and sophisti
cated sabotage and non-vio 
lent positive action.
I think, he said, we fall 
into the last class . . . The role 
of the intellectual is to build 
something concrete.
In a final session of the meet
ing, Center Fellows who had 
remained silent during the stud e n t discussions commented 
critically.
Center President Hutchins said: 
As I listened to your conversa
tion ... it seemed a good deal 
like Tammany Hall, and $ could
nt see that a young Tammany 
Hall was going to be any better 
than the old Tammany Hall, with 
its aim of lets get power, lets 
manipulate the people. In this 
case, its your contemporaries 
that you intend to manipulate as 
soon as you get political power, 
and you begin manipulating in 
order to get it. So my first 
question is about your moral 
stance.
Hutchins also said: Your con
stant insistence that it is im
possible to have a good univers
ity in a bad society leads to the 
conclusion that a Center for the 
Study of Democratic Institutions 
in a society like this is imposCMU Food Prices 
Go Up Feb. 8
A survey of nearby eating es
tablishments conducted last fall 
by the Food Service Staff Diettition that prices of most cam
pus food items are under those 
of other establishments and well 
under many. Since CarnegieMellon University food opera
tions are affected by the same 
increasing costs as other food 
establishments, it is necessary 
to make modest adjustments ef
fective February 8, 1968 in ac
cordance with the following 
schedule:
ITEM INCREASE
Soups ........................... $.05
(all types except chili which 
will remain the same)
Entrees ...................... $.05
Salads ........................ $.05
Desserts ....................... $.05
Sandwiches ................ $.05
(all types except hamburg
ers, cheeseburgers and hot 
dogs which will remain the 
same)
This price increase is not re
lated in anyway to the previous 
article appearing in the Tartan 
which implied that the increase 
would be a result of students 
not bussing. The price increase 
is only to meet rising food costs.
Library Multi-Purpose Room in 
the basement from 10 am until 10 
pm to help students with the re
cording. Any foreign student wish 
ing to make a recording should 
sign up now at the Skibo Infor

sible because the sole purpose 
of the Center is to criticize so 
ciety . . . Until the effort is 
made to explain what education 
is, it is perhaps a little prema
ture to say that it is impossible 
to have a good university. I 
didnt hear anyone give an in
telligible idea of what he 
thought the university ought to 
be, or what he thought educa
tion was.
Stringfellow Barr asked: 
What do you want to run the 
university forto do what? To 
answer your needs? Then I want 
to hear about the needs. I am 
particularly concerned as to 
whether these needs are idio
syncratic or whether they are 
something you share with all 
human beings.
One Center Fellow, Scott 
Buchanan, said he felt a cer
tain kind of anger at your play
ing house with the idea of pow
er ... I dont want to call you 
children, but you act like chil
dren ... You are talking about 
power in ways that make me 
want to spank you . . .
The thing that makes me 
weep, almost literally, is the 
impression I get that you, as a 
generation, have never had any 
good teaching. You dont know 
what a teacher is . . . 
However, another Center Fel
low, Harvey Wheeler, said: I 
think it is inexcusable for us 
to berate these students in this 
way. We have  . . expected them 
somehow to produce some kind 
of idea of a university and to 
put it into practice.
The students, in turn, rebuked 
the Center Fellows. Levine des
cribed Hutchins comments as 
naive and Kennedy said the 
Center Fellows dont know 
whats going on in the world. 
I dont think youll ever unStever to Serve 
Federal Commission
The president of CamegieMellon University has been ap
pointed to a new federal study 
group which will seek to analyze 
and deal with significant prot^ 
lems in our society, the Natio
nal Science Foundation (NSF) 
announced today.
Dr. H. Guy ford Stever will 
serve on the Special Commis
sion on the Social Sciences, said 
Dr. Philip Handler, chairman of 
the National Science Board, and 
Dr. Leland JHaworth, NSF 
director. ^ *
Consisting of 11 persons pro
minent in science and public 
affairs, the Commission was 
created because of the vigorous 
growth of basic research in the 
social and behavioral sciences 
and the nations need of the 
knowledge it generates, NSF 
officials said. The group is de
signed to bring a broad andL 
diversified background to an 
understanding of an attack on 
social problems, they added, and 
includes representatives of such 
fields as sociology, urban plan
ning, psychology, economics, po
litical science, law, labor, indus
try,, engineering, and other 
areas.
As a member me the new Com  
mission, Dr. Stever will be in
volved in:
? Statement and analysis me 
mechanism of societal and gov
ernmental institutions to facili
tate the effective use of social 
sciences in understanding and 
combatting social problems.
? Determination and imple
mentation of required collabor J ? 
ation and natural sciences, and 
engineering, in carrying out the 
fight.
? Statement of measures and 
programs to be administered by 
federal agencies,, including NSF, 
which will provide society with 
maximum benefits.
derstand, said Kennedy. I 
didnt come here to talk to you, 
though Im willing to put up 
with this session.
Bardacke said, I really don't 
know what to make of this es
calation of rudeness  I dont 
know what it is about people 
of widely different ages sitting 
together in a room that brings ^ 
it out.
In his foreward to the report 
Ferry said that the proceedings 
of the conference on Students 
and Society should be viewed 
as signals from (an) early 
warning system.
Their discussion, he said, 
might have been called The 
Worried Citizens Guide to Tumult on the Campus. It is easy 
to disagree with these youg peo
ple but they should not be ig
nored. They are profoundly con
cerned with what is happening 
in their country and the world. '
They cannot be said to be 
average young people. They are 
unusually bright, vocal, and de
termined. They are leaders in ^ 
their communities: presidents 
of student bodies, editors of pa
pers, executives of youth or
ganizations. They represent the 
leading edge of opinion among 
youth today in the way that the 
young black leaders of the past
10 years represented the blacks 
determination to achieve an 
equal share in the political, 
economical and social life of ^ 
their country. The parallel be
tween dont trust Whitey and 
dont trust anyone over 30 is 
significant.

Alienation Series Begins; 
Contemporary Music Feb. 12
Complex issues of Aliena
tion and Identity" are the topic 
of an all-University Symposium, 
which begtan Thursday, Feb. 1. 
The series is aimed at encour
aging thought and discussion on 
students critical sense of uneasyness about themselves and 
about American society.
The first session, entitled Ali
enationthe Bard and the Ana
lysis, featured poetry and com
mentary by Richard R. OKeefe, 
CMU English instructor, and Dr. 
Robert M. Morgan, CMU asso 
ciate professor of physchology, 
and director of the Counseling 
Center.
To a large student and faculty 
audience, Dr. Morgan made the 
distinction between the alien
ated and the angry. The angry 
person still accepts and works 
within the institutions of our so
ciety, recognizing their merit 
and need, but realizing that 
there is a great need for change 
within these institutions.
The alienated person, on the 
other hand, is completely with
drawn friom these institutions. 
Morgan described the alienated 
person not as an extreme indi
vidual, but in terms and condi
tions that each person in the 
audience could to some degree 
find in himself.
Alienation was outlined in 
progressive symptoms, starting 
with the typical freshman, who 
plays the roles as expected. He 
is the good, conforming student, 
who has basic biological needs 
which he satisfies in a complete
ly separate role from that of 
the college student that he is 
playing. He lacks spontanaity, 
imagination and empathy. He 
accepts tilings as they are, be
ing materialistic, fatalistic, and 
egocentric. However, he is wor
ried and lonely, which is all 
cloaked by his conformity.
The second major phase in the 
steps towards alienation comes 
with a strong falling out, often 
with a person of the opposite 
sex, who charges the alienatedinclined individual with lack of 
care. At this, the person takes 
the concept and integrates it 
with his characteristics, which 
breeds low activity, and apathy. 
I A sense developes that the de
partment has a lack of respect 
for him as an individual. The 
final product is a withdrawn be
ing, with no interaction with the 
campus, community, other in
dividuals, and very little concept 
of self.
OKeefe set the mood for the 
series, capturing the audience in 
the feelings of the alienated, 
making them aware of the ele
ments of alienation that may 
exist within themselves, and the 
essense of the traditional types 
ol alienation as seen in nature, 
children, and fathers and sons.
To relate these aspects and 
feelings of alienation, OKeefe 
read appropriate poems of Rob
ert Frost, James Wright, Rob
ert Lowell, and others. Although 
the reading was spiced with 
OKeefes insightful and often 
humorous commentary, he did 
nt attempt to analyze the 
poems, but let the poems re
late individually with each memher of the audience.
Complex issues of Alienation 
and Identity are the topic of 
an AH - University Symposium, 
which began Thursday, Feb. 1. 
The series is aimed at encourag
ing thought and discussion on 
students critical sense of uneasyness about themselves and
about American society.
The first session, entitled 
AlienationThe Bard and the 
Analyst, Feb. 1, featured 
poetry and commentary by Rich
ard R. OKeefe, C-MU English 
instructor, and Dr. Robert M. 
Morgian, C-MU associate profes
sor of psychology, and director 
of the Counseling Center.
The All-University Sympos
ium is sponsored by the Com
mittee on Religious Affairs. 
Thomas A. Huff, coordinator of 
religious affairs and YMCA exe
cutive, is directing the series.
The lectures will examine 
the causes and manifestations of 
alienation and apathy, Mr. Huff 
said. They will consider the 
fragmented, impersonal posture 
of our society, and suggest pos
sible models and methods that 
enable a meaningful search for 
identity.
Other sessions scheduled for 
February are:

...its working out just fine.
Dick Klophaus gets real 
satisfaction from the variety 
and sophistication of 
engineering needed to 
develop, design, and manage 
the processes required to 
produce Merck products.
He and his Ch.E. col
leagues get equal satisfaction 
from the knowledge that 
the end result of their work is 
a better life for more people, 
around the world.
For many engineers, it's 
an ideal combination. Add 
mobility . . . real opportunity 
for growth and promotion 
. .. real opportunity to learn 
and develop new techniques 
... Merck's liberal policies 
on benefits, graduate work,
and professional achieve
ment .. . Mercks outstand
ing sales growth (122% 
since 1957) and research 
investment ($46 million 
this year).
Add all these factors 
together, and youll see why 
Merck attracts some of 
the finest engineering talents 
in the country. And keeps 
them.
How about you? Think 
about the engineering variety 
and sophistication required 
to produce the complex 
molecules used for pharma
ceutical products. Think 
about the good use these 
products are put to.
Then see your Merck 
Representative on campus.
Dick Klophaus, by the way, 
now supervises production 
of Vitamin C, Vitamin K,, 
and various sulfa products. 
His responsibilities, and 
those of other young Ch.E.s,
