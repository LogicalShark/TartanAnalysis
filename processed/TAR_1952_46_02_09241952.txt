TSo More Thistles 
Printed; Last 
>ies DistributedCopi
At its Thursday afternoon meet
ing the Thistle Editorial Board 
decided definite policies concern
ing the distribution of unclaimed 
Thistles. This year, as last year, 
no extra Thistles will be printed. 
However, each year a few year
books are sometimes unclaimed 
by their rightful owners. The 
board has decided that these year
books, if there are any, may be 
purchased at the end of a desig
nated waiting period at the price 
of $6 instead of the usual $5.
All students were urged to sub
scribe to the Thistle at registra
tion. This was an effort to simplify 
the Thistles bookkeeping and to 
guarantee evexyone a yearbook.
Late registrants may order their
1953 Thiftle at the Thistle booth at Skibo entrance between the 
hours of 12:30 p. m. and 1:30 p. m. 
on Thursday, October 2, and Fri
day, October 3.
1952 Thistles
Persons who have subscrib
ed to the 1952 Thistle (last 
years yearbooks) and have 
not picked them up as yet 
may do so at the Skibo en
trance between the hours of 
12:30 and 1:30 p.m. on Thurs
day, October 2 and Friday, 
October 3. Friday will be the 
last day to get these year
books.
Anyone who did not order a 
1952 Thistle last year will not 
be able to obtain one now. 
No extra copies were printed.

While Brad Hunts band is play
ing in the gymnasium, Bill LeRoy 
and his band will be serenading 
the remaining students in Thistle 
Hall. Tickets are being sold in 
Skibo and by C Club members for 
$2 per couple. It is informal and 
there will be no flowexs.
Shy Players?
Because of this unusual ar
rangement, the C Club promises 
continuous dancing throughout the 
evening except for the main inter
mission. At this time Mel Cratsley, 
the new director of athletics, will 
be introduced along with the foot
ball coaches.
If the members of the varsity 
football team dont repeat their 
shy streak of last year, they also 
will be introduced to the dancers. 
It is hoped the dance will be a 
victory dance, and all arrange
ments are being made along that 
line. Refreshments will be served 
in the Black Cat by the C Club,
Students At Teeli 
Again Are Offered 
Special Tickets
The Pittsburgh Symphony is 
again offering special rates to stu
dents and school personnel for the< 
1952-53 concert season.
To students, the rates for the 
20 concert series are $7.00 for Sun
day afternoons and $9.00 for Fri
day evenings. Staff members and 
personnel receive a 20 per cent 
discount on the regular rates.
The season will open Friday 
night, October 31 under the direc

well known instrumentalists and 
vocalists. All concei'ts will be play
ed at Syria Mosque in Oakland.
Information as to who will 
handle tickets at Carnegie Tech 
will be announced later.
and Alpha Phi Omega will run 
its coat checking service.
Need Crowd 
The C Club in conjunction with 
Student Council is setting up a 
bulletin board outside Skibo to 
publicize varsity athletics, and 
hopes to apply the dance profits 
to this project.
Original plans did not call for 
the two bands, but due to contract 
difficulty there was no alternative. 
For this reason it is necessary for 
the C Club to draw a large crowd 
in order to clear on the dance.
Musicians
There will be a reception 
for all students in the music 
department on Tuesday, Sep
tember 30, at 8:00 p.m. in the 
exhibition room in the Fine 
Arts building. It is under the 
sponsorship of Phi Mu Alpha 
and Sigma Alpha Iota, depart
mental music honoraries. The 
purpose is to bring students 
and teachers to a better un
derstanding.
On Monday, October 6, 1952 
at 4:30 p.m. there will be tea 
for all eligible girls of the mu
sic department for them to be
come acquainted with Sigma 
Alpha Iota. The tea will be 
held at Carnegie Union.
First Pep Rally For Season 
Planned For Friday Evening;
At the first pre-game rally scheduled for this Friday evening 
at 7:15, the Carnegie student body will get its first chance to get 
behind the 1952 football team. The class of 1956 will be l'equired to 
attend the rally in mass and pass its new enthusiasm on to the team.
According to the tentative sched
ule, the Kiltie Band will foi'm in 
front of Fine Ai'ts about 7:15 and 
march across the Cut, hoping to 
gather a crowd on its way to 
Morewood Gardens. After parad
ing around fraternity row and the 
Morewood circle, the mob will 
proceed up Forbes street to Mar
garet Morrison and from there to 
the Tech Bowl.
Learn Cheers!
For the first few minutes the 
cheerleaders will have charge of 
the rally and will try to instruct 
the frosh along the cheering lines. 
Student Council hopes the fieshmen will familarize themselves 
with the words to the important 
cheers before they come to the 
Bowl.
A master of ceremonies will 
introduce coach Eddie Baker, who 
will attempt to outline the Tartan 
football hopes for the coming gx id 
season. He then will announce 
the captain for the California 
game and other football players 
whom he can find in the crowd.
Looking For Sponsorers
The whole program will be around a large bonfire built by 
Student Council, and will finish 
up with the cheerleadex*s and band 
leading the round of Tech songs.
Student Council has chai-ge of 
the entire pep x-ally program, and 
has several open dates for other 
organizations to step in and spon
sor a rally. Last year the class 
ox'ganizations several honoraries, 
and some activities handled the 
rallies.
Pictures
All senior and sorority pic
tures must be taken on or be
fore Saturday, October 25, in 
order to be placed in the 1953

PanHell Party 
At The Union
Numerous Activities 
Sponsored Last Year
This fall Pen Hell Council, com
posed of two representatives from 
each of the seven sororities on 
campus, plus four elected officers, 
had their annual reception on Sun
day, September 21 from 2:00 p.m. 
to 4:00 p.m. in the Carnegie Union. 
The eligible sophomore and upperclass women heard the president 
of PanHell, Eunice Brunn, and 
rushing chairman, Betty Herd, ex
plain some of the rushing rules.
Following this the president of 
each sorority explained some es
sential information about her par
ticular group.. In order to become 
better acquainted with the rushees 
and to help those considering a 
Greek group to know the mem
bers, six girls from each sorority 
and their faculty advisor attend
ed the reception.
PanHell Very Active
During rushing girls may accept 
invitations from any sorority to 
scheduled luncheons, parties, and 
teas only which are usually held 
in the Carnegie Union or the fra
ternity houses. The Council also 
funtcions as a clearing house for 
any problems that may arise be
tween the womens social sorori
ties.
Last year PanHell sponsored 
many other functions such as 
Greek Swing and Sing, intramural 
bridge tournament, PanHell For
mal, Junior PanHell council (com
posed of representatives from the 
pledge clans of each sorority), 
Panhell workshop, queen cam
paign for Spring Carnival, Pan
Hell float, and Varsity Vai'ities.
Airport Aides
In addition they provided thir

Of Obscure Paradox
By John J. John, Jr., as told to R. Durstine
After several uncommonly anxious days last week, my little 
brother Guglielmo, who had been missing for a considerable period 
of time, finally was released again into the known world. He was 
a trifle ruffled and bore the brand of one of the campus fraternities
on his left cheek (so that they will 
be able to detect him at the time 
of the last round up), but other
wise he has been returned to me 
unharmed. For this I am thankful.
And so last Friday, lighthearted 
and gay once more, I set off from 
my dusty cubicle in McBoss Hall 
for a mornings class at Carnegie 
Tech.
Mathematics Studies
As I walked toward the school, 
I saw that my fellow students 
were already at their daily labors. 
On all sides mathematics research 
assistants were busy measuring 
the ratio of freshmen with dinks 
to freshmen without dinks as a 
function of time elapsed since reg
istration day.
Within their classrooms, others 
were hard at work studying the 
results of the observations relat
ing per cent of lights lit in the 
dorms as a function of time until 
finals and the hour of the night. 
I understand that this quantity has 
been measured quite accurately 
and that a full report will be pub
lished soon.
Sophistry Class
But I was not particularly con
cerned with statistics, dinks, or 
mathematical functions Friday 
morning. Rather I was heading 
for my social relations course for 
the semester, elements of contem
porary sophistry, a prerequisite to 
the course in advanced sophistry1 
which I want to take next year.
The course is taught by Profes
sor Hyer N. Deeper, who acts as 
official arbiter in the class discus
sions which take place three times 
per week. Some instructors like to 
lead discussions since it is less ef
fort than lecturing. But Professor 
Deeper prefers to let the discussion 
romp about at random for 50 min
utes, letting any subject which 
happens to come up be the one 
that is handled on that particlar 
day.
Xenos Paradox
The principal duty of the* in
structor, then, is to set the ball 
rolling and let things lurch about 
in their natural manner for the re
mainder of the period. This may 
not provide the maximum in in
struction, but it gives the stu
dents something called valuable 
experience in solving problems 
on their own. So maybe every
thing is for the best after all. I 
am not sure, however just what 
problems we have ever solved in 
this manner.
Last Friday the point at hand 
was Xenos paradox. One precoci
ous youngster in the front of the 
room suggested we start off by 
analyzing Xenos reasons for com
posing his famed puzzle. Another, 
however, thought it would be best 
to decide whether or not there was 
such a person as Xeno before ana
lyzing his purpose in devising par
adoxes.
Battered Inscription
After considerable discussion we
Fraternities and Sororities

YOU* ULL DISCOUNTOAKLAND HARDWARE
3606 FORBES ST.
finally agreed that since the para
dox was in existence, someone 
must have written it. But we were 
hardly sure that its name had been 
Xeno. It seems that the only 
known contemporary rendering of 
his name had been badly defaced 
when some lusty Greek of the 
fourth century dropped his wine 
flagon on the inscription during a 
Saturday night Brawl.
Not knowing whether Xeno was 
Xenos name or not, we could 
hardly proceed. We solved part of 
our problem, however, by discuss
ing what Xenos name might have 
been if it were not Xeno, and 
what anyone not named Xeno 
would have meant by writing 
Xenos paradox.
In Hire of H&SS
All this was very interesting, 
and the end of the period came 
before we could get to the para
dox proper. But that is the way 
with these social relations courses. 
A point is made of presenting a 
problem which has no possible soTeknon Meetings

not. It is certainly a wonderful

Student Council Holds First 
Meeting Of New School Year
Student Council convened last Thursday night for its first meet
ing of the current school year. Itenre of interest on the agenda in
cluded plans for Kiltie Band appropriations, pep rallies, enforcement 
of freshman regulations, approval of the new Scot staff, and con
sideration of the sophomore and senior officers. i0
Dick Woods suggested a motion ? ~~ 
for Council to sponsor the first 
pep rally, summarizing the various 
details of the project and recruit
ing Council members for this la
bor. The main question as yet un
decided, is whether the event will 
be held in the Bowl or on the Cut.
Kiltie Trip
One objection raised to holding 
the rally on the Cut was the possi
bility of people walking across 
the Cut and disturbing the rally. 
Phil Drew ventured the opinion 
that nothing can disturb a pep 
rally.
Council then approved a plan to 
finance the Kiltie Band trip to 
the Bethany game by the sale of 
tickets to Tech students. The Lions 
Club of Bethany is sponsoring the 
trip and will pay half the bands 
expenses and supply the tickets to 
be sold here.
The officers for the unfilled po
sitions in the senior and sopho
more classes were announced and 
approved. The class presidents 
have appointed Pete Sherman 
senior treasurer, and Jean Bremmer and George Miley sophomore 
MMCC veep and treasurer re
spectively.
Scot Staff
Drew commended the job done
by Cwens and Scimitar so far in 
enforcing freshman regulations 
and urged that SC act to aid their 
program in some manner. Co
operation with the regulations, 
Drew said, though fair, has not 
been at the level which is de
sired.
Finally, a delegation from th 
Scot stated to Council its intention 
of continuing the publication of 
the variety magazine, and pro
ceeded to have its new editorial 
staff approved. (See article else
where in this issue.)
Help Wanted
The Tartan staff still needs 
reporters, photographers, typ
ists, headline writers, cartoon
ists, and feature writers. 
If interested, please report 
next Friday night at 7:30 to 
the Tartan office on the top 
floor of the Carnegie Union. 
Previous experience is help
ful but not necessary or re
quired.
Who is he?
This chap represents thousands of young, red-blooded sons of 
great American families. He is ready to stand on his own, to 
carry his share of responsibility. He is preparing for a bright 
future and desires to train further toward his success. He 
wants peace, security, and a full life for his family and home. 
If need be, he is ready to defend his rights and his country. 
When called on to serve in defense of American liberties, he 
will be fully trained and equipped to fly and fight with the 
U. S. Air Force.

Carnegie Plans 
International
The 1952 Pittsburgh internation
althe thirty-ninth organized by 
Carnegie Institutewill open with 
a preview on October 16 and will 
continue through December 14. 
This Is Americas oldest and big
gest international, equalled in the 
world only by the Venetian bien
nial.
The 1952 show will include sev
eral countries not recently or ever 
invited before. The Japanese will 
send fifteen paintings, and a group 
of canvases will come from Aus
tralia. Gordon Washburn, director 
of fine arts, before he began his 
trip to Europe in February, visited 
Canada and Mexico and organized 
sections from these countries. As 
usual, one third of the exhibition 
will be devoted to American con
temporary painting. In all, there 
will be about three hundred paint
ings in the show from some twentthree nations.
This is the first international to 
be organized by Gordon Wash
burn, and in discussing the plans 
for it he said; It is inevitable that 
the choices will be somewhat dif
ferent from previous years. The 
trends towards abstraction in 
America will be clearly reflected 
in the new show, which will bring 
our pictures more in line with 
those currently produced in Eur
ope, whether for better or for 
worse! The director returned from 
Europe in early August to arrange 
the installation of the exhibition 
at Carnegie Institute. A jury of 
four will meet in Pittsburgh the 
week of October 12 to award the 
prizes.
During the period of the exhibi
tion at Carnegie Institute the gal
leries will be open, free to the 
public, weekdays 10:00 a.m. to 
10:00 p.m. and on Sunday, 2:00 
p.m. to 6:00 p.m.

Superlatives have frequently 
been used in describing the 
preaching of Billy Graham. He has 
often been compared to the late 
Billy Sunday and D. L. Moody.
National Revival
In the fall of 1949, as he entered 
his 31st year, the spotlight of 
Americas acclaim fell upon him. 
At that time his evangelistic cam
paign in Los Angeles, scheduled 
originally for three weeks and 
then stretching into eight weeks 
with 350,000 persons in attend

national revival was no longer an

Anthropology Major
This national fame is a far step 
from the North Carolina farm 
house where he was born and liv
ed the early part of his life. From 
his home outside Charlotte, Gra
ham went to several schools, and 
later fraduated from Wheaton 
College in Illinois where he ma. 
jored in anthropology.
After graduating from college in 
1943, he joined the staff of the 
Youth for Christ movement. 
Speaking here in America and 
Europe he drew large audiences. 
Returning to the U. S. he started 
on his now famous crusades.
Golfing and Riding
Evangelistic Graham now makes 
his home in Montreat, North Car

him between campaigns where he 
spends his leisure time golfing and

(ibttuarg
Last Saturday night marked the last rites and 
burial of a very dear associate of one of Carne
gie's fraternities. Friends and acquaintances of 
the deceased filed solemnly past the bier in the 
Delta Tau Delta house as the cadaver lay in state 
before being committed to its tomb.
Tiie grave side ceremony was composed and 
conducted by John Ragin. It was delivered at 11:00 
p. m. in the presence of a host of mourners, both 
relatives and friends of the dead.
The text of Mr. Ragin's address follows.
With resignation to higher powers, and with 
humble reliance on the higher powers for strength 
to bear our sorrow, we commit this beloved form 
to its last resting place. Our miseries cannot be 
numbered. May those who took away our beloved 
brother not be eternally sentenced to the hell fires. 
After all, they know not what they do.
Now a few words about our brother.
In all fairness let us saw that he wasnt of the 
best grade, nor wras he of the worst grade. But 
this we can say. He always had a good head on 
his shoulders.
In moments of great stress we could always 
depend on our brother for his cool head. Some
times he had too much head, but after all we can't 
all be perfect. In fact it was his coolness that 
made things pretty hot around here.
When our book work became burning pain, 
who helped us? OUR BROTHER!
When we were alone and couldnt stand up, 
who made life comfortable in that position OUR 
BROTHER!
Who was it that cared for us like a mother, 
who knew what was happening on the inside? OUR j 
BROTHER!
And at our parties, whenever the female date or j 
the male date became particularly obnoxious, who | 
always made life look rosy? OUR BROTHER! j
I can even say without fear of contradiction 
that his influence was so potent that even the next 
morning we could not forget him.
And when things became a little low he never 
minded being tapped for a few.
Now repeat after me:
O friend of mine . . . whom I shall see no | 
more . . . All that love wrought . . . still lingers 
here with me . . . And in my dreams ... I 
see thy shining face . . , and all thy glory . . . 
And think not badly . . . as I drink to thee . . . 
at dear old Harrys.
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Dear old pal of mine,
WE MISS YOU.
Let us pray:
We hate to see thee go, dear old souse, but we 
shall send thee prayers for a final, glorious, un
mistakable resurrection. And may thy resurrected 
form be that of a flood. Amen.

Editor, the Tartan: I
Although our new IA building is all very nice 
I have one big gripe. Why did they have to put 
it so near to the fine arts school? The incessant 
babbling noises being emitted from the second floor 
are too much for any one student to endure.
It seems that one of many things could be 
done. Either those music students could play some
thing decent or close the window in the hole from 
which these eerie sounds come. But please in the 
cause of' my own personal sanity, and no doubt 
many others, KNOCK OFF THAT CONTINUOUS 
HUM-DRUM OF AWFUL SOUND.

Text Book Trouble
After looking over last weeks editorial, and the spot 
where we mentioned the experience the junior engineer was 
getting out of his summer job was worth more to him than 
any other gain he would derive from it, we had to agree 
with ourselves. Everyone did make some money on his job 
to tide him over the roughest 'financial hurdles in college, 
but no one expected to lose it all in one of these hurdles. 
The cost of textbooks to carry a college student through one 
semester seems to be getting higher every year, but even 
this wouldnt be quite so bad if he could pick up a few sec
ond hand or get rid of a few in the same manner. However, 
the school seems to be going through a transient period in 
which they have to change the textbooks each year.
To those who have been exposed to the rigors of the Car
negie Plan for many snows, the importance of a text is a little 
hard to understand. Each instructor mentions the class reference 
once at the beginning of the term and also spasmodically through
out the semester when he hasnt had time to think up a problem 
and must turn to the straight forward ones collected by the 
author. Most of the information we pick up in a course comes 
straight from the instructors mouth. There is no need to find 
the best text in the field (or keep looking) to play such a minor 
role in the class room.
When it comes right down to considering the quality of 
the book, it is pretty hard to comprehend why we have to 
have one designed to last through snow, wind, and hail for 
a 100 years. There are a few texts in the bookstore that are 
printed in pocket book form or with paper covers that cost 
in the region of $1. But most of the books are printed on 
nice paper, filled vith pictures (mostly non-essential), and 
bound in the style of the better library books. This is fine 
if the student wants to build a library of his own, but many 
of the books are of such a textbook style that they dont 
lend themselves for reierence work.
In talking this all over with the faculty members around 
school we learned that the writing of texts is a main source 
(or at least a source) of revenue for many professors. They 
could not readily see disclosing their knowledge of going 
to all the work of writing a textbook for the small royal-? 
ties derived from the $1 books. Looking at the situation in 
this light it seems a little more difficult to solve. Of course, 
we could suggest the old plan of paying all teachers (not 
only college) a better salary and almost expecting them to 
write good texts to sell within the students budget. This 
additional money would probably come from increased tui
tionso, what do we gain? Its like being caught in a vise.
We arent trying to build any lire under the Tech pro
fessors, but maybe they could ease the whole situation if they 
would write some books in their field to be used at Carnegie. 
These books wouldnt sell for any less; but if the instructors 
around here were collecting the royalties, there wouldnt be such 
a great tendency to change the texts each year. Then the stu
dents could at least cash in on the second hand market and not 
be stuck with all the books they didnt want.
No ones saying that we dont have any CIT written texts 
around here, but there are some courses where we have 
professors who seems to know far more than the author of 
the class text. Anyway, its a little better feeling to be giv
ing our own instructors some bread and butter instead of 
those at MIT, Yale, etc.
Inquiring Reporter
Reporter Gets Ideas 
On New Rush Policy
By Ken Winston
This weeks question asked by the inquiring 
reporter was as follows: What do you think of the 
new policy of having a.dry rush week? What do 
you think of the general attempt (on the part' of 
the administration) to make the campus dryif 
you feel such a policy exists?
Roger Giler, senior metallurgyI feel that this 
policy is somewhat hypocritical.
One dry week before school 
begins will not fool the parents 
of the frosh class or the fresh
men themselves. Frat men are, 
on the average, pretty level 
headed, and, I feel, should be 
allowed to use their own dis
cretion in the matter.
As far as a dry campus goes,
I do not think it is a good poli
cy. Students are going to drink 
in one way or another. It would
be much safer to have a moderate amount of liquor
on campus rather than have them go to some dive 
oft the campus where the hazards of auto acci
dents, etc. must be considered.
I think that drinking does certainly not imply 
drunkeness and that if the matter is handled in
telligently drinking should be allowed on campus.
Tom Schriempf, freshman physicsA dry rush 
week is certainly a good idea. 
It provides the rushee with a 
chance td see more of a frater
nity than the bar itself. Under
this dry system the actives 
realize what theyre doing when 
they pledge a freshman, and 
don't wake up the following 
week with a terrific hangover 
wondering where all the 
strange faces around the house 
came from. Choosing a frater
nity is a big decision in the life 
of the freshman, and the process is confusing 
enough without having drinks shoved down his 
throat wherever he might turn.
However, I am definitely against a dry campus. 
Since a great many frat men drink, theyre going 
to imbibe whether they do it on campus or else
where. It seems to me that drinking in a frater
nity is a much lesser evil than drinking in dives 
off campus.
David Lose, senior dramaI am very definitely 
in favor of dry rush week. I 
think it enables the rushee to 
form a better opinion of the 
fraternity and for the fraternity 
to form a better opinion of the 
rushee. It has worked out very 
well, in my opinion, this year, 
due perhaps to the unusually 
young frosh class.
There has been some eeling that a wet campus wrill re
duce classes. I dont believe so, 
because most people realize
that men of college age will learn to drink whether 
a campus is wet or dry. I definitely think that 
whether a campus is wet or dry all the frats 
should be the same.
A1 Rider, senior architectI have been very 
much satisfied with the health
ful, as well as the social, bene
ficial results of dry rush week. 
I think the situation has re
sulted in a far more serious 
job of rushing, on the part of 
both the frat men and th*
rushees.
I have viewed some con
cern the various rumors that
a movement is under way to 
restrict our drinking on
campus. Having seen first 
hand examples at a state university in Michigan, 
I can only feel that a dry campus would detract 
materially from the pleasantly casual atmosphere 
that has always prevailed here. The policy that
the administration has followed previously, that
of sanctioning moderate drinking, has helped in 
adjusting the college man for social life as the 
school adjusts him for his place in the contem
porary world of business and industry. I should 
like to see this policy continued.
All the persons interviewed in this survey are 
either members ui pledges in Carnegie social fra
ternities.

redeemable at the time of publication.
In previous years the series has#-
been sponsored by private manu

however, the two organizations 
have decided on making the foot
ball guessing game strictly col
legiate.
Activities, scholastics, seniors,

The success of the contest, 
measured generally by the participation on the part of the student 
body, will determine whether the 
contest will be discontinued, en
larged, or maintained in its pres

Interceptions Vital To Panthers

In spite of a last minute rally, the Tartan gridders lost a heartbreaker to the Pitt freshmen last Friday afternoon in the Skibo 
bowl. A muddy field from Thursday night rains made the game a
?-----------------------------------:--------------------slippery contest all the way.
Pitt drew first blood with about 
ten minutes gone in the first quar
ter when they ran the ball over 
around the end, after having in
tercepted a pass to set up the 
score. The first of two successful 
attempts to convert made the score 
7-0.
Gil Dissen, Plaid fullback, was 
pie 'ring with a braced shoulder 
but had to leave the game when 
he was piled up in a rough play.
7-7 Deadlock
Following the Pitt score, there 
was an exchange of punts. Ed 
Miller, Tech quarterback and 
safety man, took Pitts kick and 
ran it back 25 yards. Reuther and 
Eisaman threw body breaking 
blocks to clear the path as Miller 
raced the ball into Pitt territory.
A series of passes set up the 
score for Carnegie. Ed Millers 
toss to Craig with a lateral to 
Eisaman started the ball rolling. 
Two short passes were put to
gether for 15 yards and Eisaman 
went off tackle to about the 2 ft. 
line. Another off tackle plunge put 
the pigskin into paydirt for 6 
points. Guy Carricato converted 
to deadlock the game 7-7.
Pitt Ahead
Pitt opened the second half on 
their 20 yard line, were held cm 
four downs, then intercepted Mill
ers pass to Ziegenfuss. A long 
pass caught out of the end zone 
was a near miss for the Panthers, 
who then tried a reverse and pass 
which put them across for their 
second score. The conversion gave 
them a 14-7 advantage.
On a flipout from Miller to 
Eisaman the Plaid chalked up a 
15 yd. penalty for illegal use of 
the hands. On a handoff from 
Griffiths to Schecter Pitt was then 
penalized 15 yards for defensive 
holding.
One-Point Margin
Chuck Griffiths then went 
through the line for 30 yards to 
start another Tartan drive that 
was halted abruptly when Pitt re
covered a fumble and gained pos
session of the ball. Strong de
fensive play drove the Panthers 
back and forced them to punt.
With Tech in possession, the 
clock was running out. Two suc
cessive line bucks netted 14 yards, 
and a pass to Griffiths for 10 yards 
still left the Plaid gridders in mid
field. Miller then shot a 50 yard 
pass to Craig who was well into 
the end zone. The attempt for ex
tra point was missed and the 
game ended with the Plaid on the 
short end of a 14-13 score.

The four teams which appear to 
be the powerhouses for the com
ing season are Sigma Nu, Delta 
Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon, and Phi 
Kappa.
Pre-Season Ratings
Last years champs, Delta Tau 
Delta, lost several of its key men 
through graduation, but still re
tains a well-balanced team. On 
the other hand, Sigma Nu, last 
seasons runners-up, with their 
team still intact, will probably be 
the team to beat in the long run.
Delta Upsilon and Phi Kappa, 
both in last years playoffs, have 
had few changes in personnel and 
should give the leaders a race all 
the way down to the wire. #
The presence of several strong 
independent teams is anticipated 
this season, although it is impos
sible to rate them on any sound 
basis.
Play will begin in four leagues, 
with six teams in each league ex
cept the Scottie League which has 
only five. All games will be played 
on the three fields behind the 
FPHA barracks.

Fostball has been improving at Carnegie for the past three seasons, 
with the most successful campaign coming two years ago when Tar
tan gridders compiled a 7-1 recoyd which was as good as a record of 
four wins, three losses and one tie was the first winning season in 
many ways. This indicated a trend which was re-emphasized in 
1950 with the 7-1 showing. The winning fever was maintained through
out last years campaign with five wins and two losses, in spite of 
the initial upset to California.
Graduation losses of Ted Leaman. Johnny Luchok, Hans 
Lange, Quent Holtz, and Fritz Wilson are going to leave big 
holes in the Tartan line that only the experience of the first 
few games will enable the less famous men on the team to fill. 
The seventeen freshmen who are out for the squad this year 
should provide Coach Eddie Baker with a stronger and deeper 
set of reserves than he has had in past years.
Although the Plaid gridders are slight favorites in their opening 
game with California Teachers this Saturday, it was this same team 
that upset them in the opener last year. The men of the Plaid are 
determined and confident that it wont happen again, if they can 
help it. But what if they cant help it? Then you, the student body 
can. Many an average team has outdone itself in response to the 
commanding cheers of a wholeheartedly supporting student body.
The attitude of the students at Tech in the past few cam
paigns has been to wait and see what Coach Baker and the 
team have been able to produce in the way of exciting games, 
and then to climb onto the bandwagon after it got going. Don't 
let this happen again on Saturday. This team has the potential 
to equal if not better the all time Carnegie record of only one 
defeat.
The fact that student body support is important to the team is 
evidenced by the way in which they have cooperated with any and 
every attempt to arouse interest among the Techites. One of the 
best ways to express your support of the team this year is to make 
sure you bring your loudest set of vocal chords to the opening foot
ball rally this Friday evening the Skibo bowl. Give the Tartan 
gridders something encouraging to sleep on before their opening 
game.
Special Note to Freshmen: No doubt your high school team 
had the full-throated support of every member of its student 
body. Dont let that spirit die! The upperclassmen have been 
ground into their books to the extent that it is hard to raise a 
grunt from many of them. You can show them what it is to be 
young again . . . what it is to continue Carnegie's winning ways.

Views
As an appropriate beginning to 
another school year, News and 
Views would like to welcome back 
its former evening school friends, 
and to at least interest a few of 
the new students who may per
haps see this column for the first 
time. We promise to make no 
astounding prophecies, discoveries, 
or revelations; but we will try to 
keep the students posted on things 
that happen on the evening school 
campus.
First, we would like to mention 
that the Plaid will again be dis
tributed and placed at the entrance 
of all school buildings so that each 
student can pick up a copy when 
either entering or leaving the 
building no matter what time his 
classes begin or end.
Incidentally, if you care to see 
some of the fine improvements on 
campus, come early some evening 
and enjoy a self-guided tour 
through the new Industrial Ad
ministration Building which has 
now been completed.

Library Re-arranged, 
Students Bewildered
By Phil Drew
This summer, as the schools expansion program including the 
IA building, the new brick walls, and covering the entire campus

you look down the well of you

There is also a new gadget call

Playhouse Opens Season 
With O'Neil's 'Ah Wilderness'
The Pittsburgh Playhouse gets 
its nineteenth season underway on 
October 4 with Ah Wilderness, 
a comedy by Eugene ONeill.
The play is set in New England 
in 1906 and reconstructs a typical 
American family and home. The 
familys chief concern is the 
youthful fervor of the boy, Rich
ard, who is a high school senior 
and a rebel. The play carries 
through his discipline problem 
with his father, his puppy-live 
with the girl next door, and his 
mad fling with a chorus girl.
Tickets are now on sale for 
Ah Wilderness which will open 
in the new Craft Avenue Theater 
on October 4.
Mrs. Ruth Mercer Named 
Carnegie Union Hostess
Mrs. Ruth Mercer has been ap
pointed Hostess of Carnegie Union 
replacing Mrs. Rosalie Hagins, 
who is now at Morewood. Mrs. 
Mercer wishes to extend a warm 
and hearty welcome to CIT stu
dents who care to come to the 
Union. She says she always liked 
people and students especially.
She hails from Clarksburg, West 
Virginia, and spent three years as 
assistant Director of Terrace Hall 
(a Mountaineer version of Morewood Gardens) at West Virginia 
University in Morgantown, W. 
Va. The Union will be open for 
students until 12 p.m. week nights 
and from noon to 12 p.m. on Sun
