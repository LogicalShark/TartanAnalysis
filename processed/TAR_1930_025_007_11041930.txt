NEW YORKERS WIN SURPRISE VICTORY OVER PLAID GRIDDERS IN FIFTH ANNUAL CLASH; 20-7
Tartans Stage Fast Drive 
For Single Touchdown 
In Second Quarter
PLAIDS PLAY RAGGED
Chick Meehans Violets 
Show Alertness in 
Dowing Skibos
BY JOE MICHAELSON 
Nothing less than a decisive vic
tory is due the New York University 
football club for their fine showingon the gridiron here last Saturday: 
 Their superior brand of playing 
was the all important factor in the 
Tartans 20-7 defeat. For his tu
telage alone, Coach Chick Meehan 
should be presented with the larg
est kind of a feather for his cap, 
for lie has developed a fast, brainy 
team of real footballers from fairly 
young material' "of the average 
stock.
Although the Skibos were hinder
ed by injuries in the last half, their 
first string players 1 did not put 
up their usiial capable - resistance 
to the Violet attacks in .the earlier 
part of the game. The Plaid team 
looked, virtiially; the better outfit; 
but were outplayed in each quarter, 
and . seemed unable to get off on 
the right foot. This outcome goes 
down in the class of those tin fath
omed mysteries which are based on 
the Patron Saint of Mental Atti
tude. It is certain that the New 
York boys were physically and 
mentally set for the fracas, while 
it is possible that our home team 
was super-charged a good' while 
before the game.
New Yorkers Score Early 
The Violets took advantage of 
their opponents fauxpas early in 
the first few minutes and hung up, 
their initial six points.-. The Tar
tans had attempted a forward pass, 
which was intercepted by La Mark, 
who bagged the. oval and trotted 
the remaining 20 yards to a, touch
down.
Chick Meehans stalwarts made 
another break for themselves in 
the second quarter,when Grant de
stroyed Carnegie's attempt to 
plint. Wli.cn the linesmen squared 
off it was -New Yorks ball on 
Carnegie's 20 yard line. On the 
next play a Violet jersey advanced 
the pigskin to the .onc-'foot line. 
Here the Tartan forward\wall dug 
in and held for a down, but the 
following play brought the score 
to 13-.0Jn favor of the visitors. 
Tartans Drive Successful 
A review of Carnegies drive for 
their lone totichdown brings to 
mind a short but very sweet affair. 
Stuart Ducgcr, a sophomore mak
ing his debut at' quarterback, start
ed the ball on its goal-ward jour
ney. Karcis, Eytli and Roscnzwcig 
were most instrumental in toting 
the oval to the final stripe. The big 
push-over was effected by a welldirected pass to Rosenzweig, who 
wriggled into the scoring zone aft
er being tackled at the five-yard 
line. Captain Dreshar made no 
bones about kicking the extra 
point, thus bringing the score to 
13-7,- with the Violets on the 
blooming end of things.
Dutch Eytli broke loose for a

The members of Carnegie Techs 
football team are to be the guests 
of honor according to custom. 
An invitation is extended to Pitt 
football players, students, and 
alumni to be present at this affair 
in order to help make it a suc
cess. The enthusiastic cheering at 
the football game is one way of 
encouraging our team; making 
merr3r after the game is another.
ONE-THIRD OF STUDENT 
BODY RESPONDS TO 
1930 Y CAMPAIGN
Freshman Cabinet of Y.M. 
Will Be Organized 
In December
DR. HULL WILL SPEAK 
TO THE OXFORD CLUB 
ON PEACE MEASURES
A world-wide traveler of note, 
Dr. William I. Hull will speak to 
the Oxford Club Sunday night, No
vember 9, on the internationally 
discussed., probleni of World Peace 
and Disarmament. Dr. Hull comes 
to speak at the Oakland Methodist 
Church from Swarthmorc College, 
where he is prpfessor of history 
and international relations.
Dr. Hull because of his study, 
travel, and experience in interna
tional affairs, is _ uniquely suitable 
y(to the topic of his discussion. He 
- is a graduate of. Johns Hopkins 
University, has done ,work on the 
European Continent in the Univer
sities of Berlin, Leyden and Paris, 
is a Fellow of the Royal Historical 
Socicty, is a trustee of the Church 
Peace Union, a member of the 
Executive Committee of the World 
Alliance, and author of many ar
ticles and a half dozen books on 
pacific settlement and disarmament.
Dr. Hull is a gifted speaker. 
He has attended five International 
Conferences on the problem of dis
armament, including the Washing-, 
ton Conference of 1921-22. Speak
ing for disarmament, he made a 
trip around the world, took an ex
tremely active part in public de
bates as a speaker for disarmamentmeasures at hearings before Con
gressional Committees.
About one-third of the student 
body has responded to the sub
scription campaign of the Y. M. 
and Y. W. C. A.'s of the campus 
to date, and the campaign leaders 
feel that a good many more will 
pledge before the end of this week 
wHen the campaign will be brought 
to a close. The freshmen are en
thusiastically responding to the 
drive, Section 10 showing a per
centage of 92 per cent. All but 
two members of the sectipn have 
pledged to join the campus or
ganization. Mr. Davis, secretary of 
the campus Y. M. C. A., states 
that, anyone may subscribe at the 
Y. M. C. A. "office, and that already 
quite a few have joined in this 
manner.
The department heads' arc re
quested by the campaign leaders 
to turn in the results from their 
section as early as possible, and to 
turn in the cards by the end of 
the wccki
A Freshman Y. M. C. A. Cabinet 
will be formed this year, probably 
immediately after rushing season 
has terminated. The Freshman 
Cabinet was organized last year for 
the purpose of acquainting fresh
men with the Y. M. C. A. work 
on the campus. Members for the 
cabinet are selected because of 
their interest in Y. M. C. A. activi
ties.
The Cabinet holds regular meet
ings twice a month, meets with the 
Senior and Y. W. C. A. Cabinets 
in scheduled social lunches, aids 
the Senior Cabinet in. considering 
and aiding campus activities, and 
serves to stimulate .chapel attend
ance. For the sophomore year, 
members who serve best on the 
Freshman Cabinet continue to serve 
on a Sophomore Cabinet, while 
some members are selected for the 
entire organization cabinet.
All Hi-Y men in the Freshman 
Class are asked to leave their 
names at the Y. M. C. A. office. 
Hi-Y men will be considered in 
the choice of members for the new 
cabinet; however, any freshman

A Reminiscent Account About
Carnegie, Twenty-five Years Ago
BY DR. JOSEPH H. JAMES
Editor's NoteThis and the adjacent story are the first of n series either by or about 
members of the faculty who have been at Carnegie since its inception.
Twenty-five years seem a long time 
whenlooking ahead, but how rapidly 
the years have -gone since Octobcr, 
1905, when the original faculty of 
Carnegie started in the'lower part of 
the prc'scnt Industries building with 
that first day class of one hundred* 
and twenty men!
The courses were all of three 
years* length then, and instead of 
being called by the usual engineering 
titles, they appeared in the catalogue 
under such headings as, mechanical 
engineering practice, civil engineering 
practice, ctc.
In the first 3-ears work,, in fact 
with the Plebcs for several years, 
lectures were given to individual sec-' 
tions, instead of to tne class in one 
assembly. Mr. McConway, a trustee 
and prominent Pittsburgher, who took 
a keen personal interest in the schools, 
oncc remarked: "Whether, we arc 
training the students, I am not sure, 
but we are certainly training the^ 
lecturers.
An interesting book could be written on the school in those early 
years. 1 was always hoping that Pro
cessor Kcllar would rake a notion 
to do this. He was the first professor 
of mathematics and endowed with 
that wonderful personality thatmade 
him popular with faculty and stu
dents. At one time fie wrote a 
series of articles for the Tartan on 
the every day happenings at the 
school that arc really literary gems. 
He had a delightful sense of humor 
and o'ur early history, could not have 
been written by any one better than 
b}' Professor Kcllar.
I must tell one sloiy involving 
Professor Kcllar. It was during the 
second school year. The plcbcs were 
to have a banquet on a certain 
night, and the news leaked out some
how. The sophs learned that Pro
fessor Kellar was to be the faculty 
speaker at this banquet. Four large, 
huskj' specimens from the sophomore 
class decided that thg, freshmen 
should not have a speaker that night.

WILL FURNISH MUSIC AT 
ANNUAL MILITARY BALL
The Venetian Serenaders will 
furnisli the music for the annual 
military ball to be held this year 
on Friday, November 14, in the 
Union. The tcn-picce orchestra, 
composed of some of the best 
musicians in this section, have 
proved a big success at every en
gagement this year, and arc ex
pected to be at their best at the 
ball.
Decorations for the ball will be 
more impressive than ever. Will 
Worland and Lester Neely, the 
decorations committee, have made 
plans for a militaristic setting which 
will greatly surpass any of the 
former years. Lighting cffccts, to 
be produced by several colored 
spotlights, will blend in with the 
decorations. A special electrical ar
rangement will be provided to make 
this possible.
The favors this year will be of 
a distinctively military design, as 
has been the custom in former 
years, and will probably be a 
miniature of some army weapon.
The price of admission will be 
the same as that oflast, $3.50 a 
couple. - Tickets may / be sccurcd 
from members of Scabbard and 
Blade or from any of the R. O. 
T. C. representatives.
Several inquiries have been made 
as to who were elected as honor
ary cadet officers. The only way 
of .finding the answer to this ques
tion is to be at the military ball, 
at. which the honorary officers will 
receive their commissions. At the 
same time, the Scabbard and Blade 
will make its annual call from the 
junior and senior men registered 
in the R. O. T. C. coursc.
The ball wil! be a formal affair. 
Last year was the first year that 
it was formal, and it is chiefly due 
to the success of last years ball 
that this decision was made. The 
ball promises to be one of the 
main events on this year's social 
calendar.
Nominations for honorary cadet 
officers include the following womcy: 'Betty Steele, Ida Campbell, 
Doris Mather, Gertrude Young, Car

Barbecue and Muddy Trails Were
Features of First Days at Carnegie
In this day of changes, the stu
dent is quite accustomed to having 
new instructors every year and . oft
en fails to realize that some 
members of the faculty have been 
with us for many years. I11 
this latter class wc may put Pro
fessor Wurts, who, after 25 years 
is still conncctcd w.i.'tlyCarnegie 
Tech. Professor Wurts was the 
first man to join the Carnegie fac
ulty when the school was estab
lished in 1905, and the changes 
which lie has seen take placc on 
the campus are indeed interesting.
'For instance, 25 years ago plans 
were formulated by Mr, Carnegie 
for the establishment of a tradci 
school. The demands of young 
men who were anxious for edu
cation in engineering work necessi
tated the abandonment of these 
plans, and as a result the Carneie Technical Schools replaced the 
Carnegie Trade School. In spite of 
the change, however, the public 
still held to the trade school' 
idea, and for several }rcars the en
rollment was hampered by the be
lief spread throughout the country
that Carnegie was merely a trade 
school.
Other chariges . than in name 
have taken place in the years 
since the founding of this school. 
Carnegie was not always the proud 
possessor of a 'quadrangle,' for in 
those early years, the present 
Beanerys ancestor occupied the 
placc given over to Fritz beloved 
grass and trees. Not only did this

ization at this time. This is the only 
time during the year that the Guild 
appeals to the students of Carnegie 
for fund  that will enable them to 
carry 011 their philanthropic work, 
and it is hoped that" the response 
will J)c as generous as has been 
clicitcd in the past. The cost of 
membership is only fifty cents, a 
fact which should make the mem
bership one hundred per cent!
Department Heads Appointed
Elsa Weber, the president, has. ap
pointed a girl in each class of each 
department to act as a drive worker, 
so that everyone will be given a 
chance to contribute. The committcc

anthropic program.
Founded by Clara Linforth West
The Carnegie Tech Guild was 
founded by Miss Clara Linforth West, 
who was formerly a Dean of Mar
garet Morrison College, for phil
anthropic purposes, aiid much time 
and money have been expended on 
worth while projects. 1 Some ofits 
services have been donations to the 
Social Service Department of the 
'Allegheny General Hospital; tlicj/ 
have provided dental attention for 
needy children; helped support orphan
ages and hospitals, and have been 
^specially interested in the furnishing 
of a girls club room in Kingsley 
Settlement House, for which they 
have supplied pictures, curtains, and 
wickcr furniture. It has also gather
ed books for "hospitals, and its 
members have made scrapboqks for 
the children in hospital wards.

to found a summer camp for poor 
children.

ALUMNI NEWS
LIBERAL PREpiCTIONS concerning the outcome of the 
Pitt-Tech game seem out of order since Chick Meehan again 
upset the dope for Carnegie. We would like to see the City 
Championship Trophy in a conspicuous place within our own
halls, but---------well no predictions this time.
*****
THE McNAMARA QUARTETTE must certainly present 
its own difficulties for Coach "Chick Meehan. Chick has 
only four McNamaras on his varsity squad, each hailing from a 
different high school and claiming no family relationships with 
the remaining trio.

NEW YORKS JINX TO CARNEGIE proved to be ex
ceedingly versatile Saturday in that it also worked successfully 
with the Violet cross-countrymen. Lerner and Barker of N. Y. 
U. finished in a dead heat of 28 minutes and 10 seconds. Jess 
Price, Tartan cap.taiii, finished third with a time of 28 minutes 
and 28 seconds to give Carnegie its only place among the first 
eight to finish. The New Yorkers took 18 points to the Plaids 
37.
Plaid Yearlings and Bellefonte Gridders Flay Scoreless Tie
"Aw, rats, were jinxed! was the 
cply one Plcbe warrior gave when 
asked why the freshmen had turned 
out to be a bunch of scoreless won
ders. And it seems as if he is about1 
right, for last Saturday the Car
negie youngsters played their third 
consecutive scoreless tic, and made 
it the fourth straight game in which 
they have' failed to cross the enemys 
goal line. Still wc shouldnt kick, be
cause they ^completed their season 
undefeated and at times showed 
;ome pretty classy football, especial
ly on defense.
Saturday was a bad day for the 
Carnegie supporters all around. About 
three or four hundred fans shivered 
for two hours in the bowl, praying 
for the young Tartans to break the 
ice, and after being disappointed 
:hesc same fans trudged over to the 
Stadium, only to be heart-broken 
tgain.
Concerning the Plcbe game, there's 
aot much to be said. Only once dur
ing the game did either team thrcat:n. This came in the second quarter 
vhen The Plaids carried the ball to 
ihe Bellefonte twenty-yard line. Herg

score; in executing a forward pass,

school boys broke it up. A fumble 
resulted, and Bellefonte recovered. 
The remainder of the game turned 
out to be a tame punting duel, both 
sides 'hoping for a break that never 
came.
On the Bellefonte lineup were 
several names very much familiar to 
the Carilegie followers, among them 
being Ducanis and Roscnsweig. It 
is whispered about that these chaps 
are little brothers of the two boys 
on the Tech varsity who bear those 
names.
As in all the games this season, 
the 'Plcbe line proved'far too much 
for the opposing backficld to gain 
through corisistantly, and Stewart, 
Lewis, Forcsman, and Croft dis
couraged end runs at an early hour.
Coach Allison nearly had an at
tack of high blood pressure in the 
second half ^hcn the referee re
fused to call out the linesmen on 
a doubtful last down. However it 
didnt make much difference, for a 
moment later, the Plebes intercepted 
a Bellefonte heave, putting the ball 
in the exact spot it was in before.
A REMINISCENT ACCOUNT
(Continued^ from Page One)
A sophomore dinner was arranged 
and our. sophs started out to kidnap 
Professoi^ Kellar. lie lived out on 
Sheridan avenue, and as lie left his 
house to go to the car line, our 
sophs, who had been waiting, walked 
along and fell in step with him. 
"Good evening, Professor, where arc 
you going?" one said. Instead of 
his usual greeting and smile, Pro
fessor Kellar growled that that was 
his business. "Wc want you to go 
with us instead of to the place you 
intended to go, persisted the soph 
spokesman, and gently took the Pro
fessor by the arm. "You let go of 
me, growled the professor, and just 
then the car pulled up and he got 
aboard, leaving four rather stunned 
sophs standing on the corner. After 
looking at each other for a few 
minutes, one of them remarked, 
"Well, boys, 'I guess that was an 
example of the power of mind over 
matter."
During the first few years of the 
school, every applicant for admission 
was interviewed by Director Hamerschlag. There was nothing to frighten 
a student in these interviews, as they 
always consisted of some friendly 
questions by the Director about the 
students interests, but a different im
pression was spread about, as the 
following will show. One morning I 
was coming across the Junction Hol
low Bridge and overheard two high 
school boys talking. "Say, said one, 
do you know that at this new school 
over there, (pointing to Tech) they 
can tell by looking at you whether 
you are smart or not?

Alumni Nov. 15
Organization To Serve 
Luncheon at Noon 
Each Day
Wc take our cue from Mr. Harry 
Keck, of the Sun-Tclcgraph, whose 
article about dreams and a stadium, 
which was filled for the first time
when Pitt met Notre Dame, has
aroused much interest on. our cam
pus, for didnt we play to a more 
than capacity crowd last year when 
we met Notre Dame in the Sta
dium? We did! and we have pic
tures of it, too.
The Carnegie Tech Alumni As
sociation lias long hoped that a 
down town Carnegie T ech Club
might be established  a place
where Carnegie Tech alumni could 
meet, take their friends, and have a 
few minutes together to talk over 
old times, and now we are about 
to realize that dream. The Prince
ton Club, which for several years 
has had a luncheon club, with 
headquarters on the second floor 
of the building at 421 Fifth ave
nue, Pittsburgh, an ideal location 
in town, in moving to the new 
quarters of the Princeton, Yale and 
Harvard Club, and we arc plan
ning to take - over the old Prince
ton Club quarters. Applications for 
membership are being received 
now, and we hope to open the 
new Carnegie Tech Down Town 
Club about November 15.
Luncheon Plans
Here arc the plans: The Foster 
Restaurant, immediately below our 
new quarters, will serve , a la cartc 
luncheons each day from 11:30 to 
2 oclock. You may order just 
what you want, then you can play 
a game of bridge, read; or just 
loaf until your lunch hour is over. 
Wc know of some lunch hours 
which arc extensive. You probably 
do, too, so wc wont mention 
names. The Princeton Clubhas 
been operating under the same ar
rangement with the Foster Restau
rant, and has found it very satis
factory. If the boss gives'you the 
afternoon off you can go ov.er to 
the Carnegie Tech Club and lounge 
around and maybe you will find 
a few others there. Who kno^vs? 
This will be a fine place to meet 
your friends, a place  you can-call' 
your own.
The committee, composed of 
Clarence Ovcrcnd, chairman, How
ard Bowman, Robert Schmcrtz, and 
William Ski.nkle, are enthusiastic 
over the number of applications 
for membership received to date, 
and the interest shown over the 
idea.

Due to the abscncc of the

for the past few weeks. We 
hope that anyone who submitted 
information for publication will 
understand that it was not omit;d or neglcctcd intentionally, 
and that contributions are not 
being greatly discouraged. We 
hope toumprove the page in the

Metal on trial
In the laboratories of scores of foundries 
and rolling mills, a constant search is being 
conductedforametal thatis stronger, more 
resistant to temperature strains, and more 
economical to produce. Almostas constantly 
the compounds and alloys so developed 
are being brought to Crane Co. for trial.
The court that passes on them is composed 
of the most experienced Crane designers, 
metallurgists, and engineers. Under its 
direction bars of the new metals are care
fully tested for ductility, reduction of area, 
elastic limit, and yield andbreaking points. 
Hardness, transverse strength, and 
torsional strength^are measured, behavior 
under temperature strains is determined 
by SATTT hour creep tests.
When the findings of all tests tre favor
able, the metals are made into valves and 
fittings for trials in the Crane plant that 
will approximate actual working condi
tions. Then Crane Co. sends out these 
new materials to certain engineers who are 
interested in advancing piping practice. 
They use them in actual service; observ
ing them over long periods, sending full 
reports to Crane Co.
Not only do materials thus developed serve 
all industry. They have contributed to a 
vast library of engineering data on metals 
and their capabilities. Much of this is em
bodied in a book-. Pioneering in Science, 
a valuable reference manual for students. 
Let us send it to you.

Night Industries Holds Election 
of Officers
In conjunction with the first 
smoker of the year, the Night Col
lege of Industries held its election 
of officers to serve on the Night 
Student Council for the coming 
year. The election was conducted 
by President Sansonetti of the 
Night Student Council.
Before the election Mr. Sansonctti spoke on the work of the 
council and outlined the require
ments which must be met before a 
student is eligible for election to 
the council.
The officers elected were: Presi
dent, James S. Geyser; vicc presi
dent, .Edward E. McDonald; secre
tary, John F. Simpson, and treas
urer Sebastian W. Phillippi.
The new officers arc very capa
ble of representing - Industries in 
the Night Student Council. All of 
them have been active, in student 
affairs and from the experience so 
gained the student body of Indus
tries may well be assured that their 
interests will be attended to. A 
word or so about the officers is 
appropriate at this-time so that the 
students may become acquainted 
with the representatives they have 
chosen. C
Mr. Geyser has been on the cam
pus for six years. Previous to this 
election'lie has served on, the Niglit 
Student Council for two years, be
ing treasurer of that\ body last 
year. He has been on the Plaid 
staff for three years, serving in the 
capacity of News Editor last year 
as. well.as this year. He has been 
Editor-in-Chicf of the night stu
dents handbook for the last two 
years. v
Mr. McDonald hardly needs any 
introduction to the night student 
body at Carnegie, but for the bene
fit of the new students, some of 
his work is mentioned here. He 
has served on the Night Student 
Council for several years and has 
been elected to the office of presi
dent on two occasions. He com
piled 'and published the first Night 
Student Carnegie Handbook six 
years ago., He has been1 active in 
making the nightsection of the 
Thistle a success and in many 
other ways has been promoting the 
welfare and activities of the night 
student body. In addition lie is 
also successfully editing the Plaid.
Mr. Simpson has been on the
campus for three years arid has
been very active in Council work 
and student activities in the Night 
College of Industries.
Mr. Phillippi has been on the
campus for^five years. He served 
on the Council last year and has 
given the Council and the indus
tries student body hjs loyal sup
port on many occasions.
, Ff<jin this brief resume of the. 
officers it can be seen that they 
arc all capable men and it is the 
duty of every night student in In
dustries to give them their loyal sup
port on -every occasion..

They shut the door on hybrid styles
Quantity production of equipment has long 
been practiced by the telephone industry. 
Telephone designers years ago. shut the door 
on many hybrid stylesseeking first to work 
out instruments which could best transmit the 
voice, then making these few tpes in great 
quantities:
This standardization made possible concen
trated study of manufacturing processes, and
steady improvement of them. For example, the 
production of 15,000,000 switchboard lamps a 
year, all of one type, led to the development 
of a highly special machine which does in a 
few minutes what once took an hour.
Manufacturing engineers, with their early 
start in applying these ideas, have been able to 
develop methods which in many eases have be
come industrial models. The opportunity is there!
BELL SYSTEM
A NATION-WIDE SYSTEM OF MORE THAN 20,000,000 INTER-CONNECTING TELEPHONES
MATURITY GOES IN
FOR EDUCATION;
The above heading over an ar
ticle in The Trojan Owl, official 
organ of a Southern California 
Night School, resulted in the fol
lowing thoughts. Perhaps the old
er men and women of the country 
are beginning to realize that the 
world docs move, and that riow-adays, experience docs not count for 
much, considering that in present 
day business, methods move so 
swiftly that the things that were 
learned a short time ago arc ob
solete.
New processes and methods of 
manufacture, selling and shipping 
are developed almost over night, 
and unless one takes the proper 
amount of .care, lie or she is apt to 
find that they are hopelessly an
tiquated in their ideas. Personal 
reading and self-instruction help, but 
most of those who realize the trend 
of affairs realize that it is perhaps 
more reasonable to place ones self 
under the care of trained educa
tors, such as are to be found in a 
host of night schools throughout 
the country.
Many of the old-timcns who 
complain about the injustice of em
ployers in'laying off men and wom
en who have been with the organ
ization for years, fail to think that 
the persons who arc so misfortunate arc perhaps more to blame 
than the man who does the hiring 
and firing. During a slack season, 
men who are the employers of a 
lafgc number of people find that 
their only hope .of survival lies in 
cutting the payroll.
With this thought in mind the 
employer naturally looks about for 
those who are the least valuable to 
his interests, and consequently 
lights upon' the employes who, 
frbm lack of realization of the 
growth of business, or from lazi
ness, arc not able to keep pace 
with the naturally 'heavy work per 
person entailed by cuttting the 
force because of the lack of 
knowledge oTihc new methods in
stituted since they were hired.
Marty of those who arc at pres
ent employed feel that further 
training, would enable them to be 
not only more sure of their posi
tion, but also more fitted for ad
vancement. Hence the night school.

THE WESTINGHOUSE
MEMORIAL
The Westinghousc memorial, re
cently unveiled in Schcnlcy Park, 
is a most fitting tribute to the 
fame of Pittsburghs great inven
tor. Each day brings many visi
tors to admire this monument as 
itrests among the most beautiful 
natural surroundings.'
Through the inventive genius, of 
Mr. Westinghousc many thousands 
of people have been given employ
ment His invention of the air 
brake practically revolutionized rail
road transportation. All his inven
tions and developments were for 
the advancement of civilization and 
products bearing his name are 
found in every country of the 
world. Westinghousc plants of 
every description arc to be found 
everywhere.
Mr. Westinghousc  was well lov
ed by. his employes and there was 
genuine sorrow when lie died about 
18 years ago. The many thousands 
of persons employed by the exten
sive Westinghousc companies con
tributed to the cost of this memor

In those early 'days students 
could not walk surc-footedly over 
carcfully laid cement walks. Why 
not? There were noneonly muddy 
trails cohncctcd the various build
ings. These trails were particular
ly pleasant on rainy days, and the 
students who arrivedin class with
out being spattered with sticky 
clay from the knees down was 
truly a superior person. What a 
boon it was to the janitors to 
have the plcbes . scrub the floor as 
a penalty for the violation of rules. 
After a few years boardwalks re
placed the clay paths, and still 
later by cement sidewalk1. Who

The students in the first class to 
enter Carnegie Tech did not limit 
their activities to things education
al. Barbecuing was done in a big 
way, A huge pit was dug in the 
ccntcr of the campus and a whole 
ox roasted therein. Why this cus
tom' was not continued is a dark 
sccrct. Tlunk of the money some 
enterprising soul could make if he 
revived this eaVlv tradition. One 
ox, divided into innumerable sand
wiches, at fifteen ccnts a sandwich 
would be' the equivalent' of wajiy 
tea dances. Who knows, 25 mort 
years may find barbecue stands iri

Thats a new oneGrape Oil. 
It is remarkable what different 
I opinions and arguments one hears 
fr^m time to time about that much 
abused word prohibition. It seems 
to depend upon which end of the 
stick you are on. Now,, grapes 
arc perfectly harmless bccausc 
dame nature saw fit to give a 
bumper crop and somebody who 
has a large interest at stake saw 
to it that the ban was lifted and 
we poor mortals were allowed to 
brew as much grape juice as we 
desired. It seems like only yester
day that we heard of men being 
culprits if they only so much as 
bought a quantity of the fruits of 
the vineyard. But what's the use, 
you cant be expcctcd to know 
everything.
Somebody seems to know a lot 
about parking on the campus at 
night judging from the article, "A 
little more on parking. I shouldnt 
worry about  this feature since I 
dont have time to drive a Car, and 
even if I did have the time, I 
don't have the car. At all events, 
those who do have cars would do 
well to abide by the rules and reg
ulations which are in force, bccausc 
I have noticed a certain member of 
Pittsburgh's Own being put . to 
the necessity of placing some of 
those neat little tags on the pcrambulaiors which one secs adorning 
the campus at night.
While rambling through the hall 
of fame 011 the top floor of the 
Arts recently I noticcd a neat little 
case which suggested to me that. 
I was in a grocery1 store or some 
such place where you sec those at
tractive containers filled with the 
appetizing viands from the .pantry. 
Upon investigation I found that 
this was the basis of a contest 
which was being waged for suggcsI tions and designs for new labels 
to be placed 011 the packages. P. 
& D. certainly is the department 
which will produce the results and 
here's wishing success to the.winjicr. Architects, should1 not read 
this, because the ease which coritains the goodies is too handy to 
them, especially when they arc 011 
charcltc,
I am glad I started with my col
umn before all the others started 
sending in their material, bccausc 
I am sure somebody would beat 
jne to it if I hadnt been first. Last 
weeks Plaid was a fine spread and 
I do hope they continue to' print 
such pages.
Night Industries Smoker A Suecessful Affair
The Night Industries smoker held 
Saturday evening, Octobcr 25, was 
as usual a very successful frolic. 
Everything to satisfy the entertain
ment and gastronomical cravings of 
the seven hundred or so students 
there had been attended to by the 
committee. There was an abundance 
of smokes as well as several kinds 
of noise makers.
As cach student, entered the gym 
his ticket was torn in half for the 
door prize drawing. Then as he 
walked past a row of tables he was 
handed cigars, cigarets, rntehes, pa
per hats and many kinds of noise 
making contraptions. After ' chccking 
their clothing the boys found chairs 
and the stage show began.
Acsops Fables went over big, 
for the first movie, and brought many 
laughs from the crowd. In a comedy, 
'Harry Langdon showed the boys a 
thing or two about this game callcd 
football. The way lie ran rampant 
through the opposition was nobodys 
business. Of could it be callcd 'running?
A couple of gay caballeros proved 
to be very popular with their guitar 
and accordion music. These boys 
played several popular selections and 
had to answer many encores. One 
of them also played a mouth organ. 
The man at the xylophone, that in
strument .which looks like sparcribs, 
was none other than our old friend 
A1 Wagner. lie went over in a 
big way for he sure could hammer, 
those sticks. The piano player ren
dered several solos as well as ac
companying A1 and the Gypsies.
The door prize drawing came next 
and the lucky boys were presented 
with pipes, or a cigarctc ease and 
lighter. The winners were W. N. 
Nidywieck, electrical equipment, W. J. 
Gianni, plumbing, and H. E. Schwarzbach, general studies.
The boxing could have been bctr 
ter. One of the contestants scheduled 
for the first bout met with an acci
dent and a substitution was necessary, 
at the last moment. However/ the 
boys in the last bout provided plnty 
of action and made the gang forget 
the first fracas.
This was the smoker at which the 
ofiiccrs to represent the Night Col
lege of Industries on the Night 
Student Council were clcctcd. Alore 
details of the election appears else
where 011 this page.
Last but far from the least was 
the lunch, and what victuals they 
were. Ham arid cheese sandwiches, 
apples, pickcls and olives, ice crcam, 
milk and something new, little in
dividual pics, There was plenty for 
everyone and if anybody didnt get 
enough it's too late now.
If you missed the last smoker 
you missed a good time and a lot .of 
fun. There willbe another smoker 
for the Industries in  the second 
semester so plan now to be there; 
you have about five months to do it.

Sunk jRftiiftu lignrlte
Oncc upon a time, almost all of 
the nc\y novels concerned themselves 
with having at least one of the 
principal characters ot royal blood. A 
small kingdom, lots of political un
rest, a tottering monarchy, and then, 
enter, tiie American hero! Amid the 
cheers of the populacc, he is made at 
least a king at the end of the book 
and marries a princcss of royal 
descent. Do you remember the formu
la? Ill lay you a little bet on the 
side, too, that you still 4 prefer them. 
If you take that bet youre a liar; 
if you 'dont, you just think youre 
sophisticated,' but you arent. Omino. 
And here is proof. Morris Gilbert has 
written a book? Oh, he has, has he? 
Yeah, and what arc you gonna do 
about it? (Children!) Anyway, it's 
callcd ,LIDO LADY, and a nicer 
title can only be imagined. As of
ficial warncr, I warn you right here 
and now, if you never liked the 
kind of book outlined above, (and if 
there' is any such, let him step for
ward, the goop) keep away from this 
tome. If . you do, swealhcart, youll 
go for this in a big way. What, I 
mean is, youll be pleasantly sur
prised. Essentially' the same, as far 
as plot goes, as a thousand others 
youve read, LIDO LADY bccausc 
of the difference in writing style. 
And, I much prefer this, the1 ncW 
way. In case you didnt get that, it 
means that Gilbert writes with his 
tongue in his cheek, with his pen 
dripping wit, and with his eye on the 
box-officc. (Lines form 011 the right, 
puhleasc.) Seriously though, the book 
doesn't deserve such flippancy, and 
the first chance I get, Im going to 
tell a ccrtain alleged book-rcviewcr 
a few things. I, too, have a soul, you 
know. Plot? Did I hear some one
say Plot? Tsk, tsk. Where have you 
been? Well, it seems that a ccrtain 
American millionaire, John Suggs, Jr., 
(and dont you just love that name?) 
had to go and fall in love with a 
girl lie meets 011 the beach. Now, 
her name is Grctchcn, and youd 
think that any one smart enough to 
be a millionaire would get some hint 
from that, but John Suggs, Jty
doesnt. Anyway while he is busy
arranging things for their coming
marriage, what happens? Dont ask. 
She goes and gets herself made a 
queen,, no less. Of course, that leaves 
Mr. Suggs out in the cold, so lie! 
swears a bad .swear and vows to 
crush her kingdom. Isnt that ripping 
so far?' Well, the rest is just as 
good. However, the best praise I 
can. give Mr. Gilbert, is in mention
ing the fact that he writes some
what like a big favorite with meEric Hatch.
Now, then, L.G. see what happens 
when I try to prove what you say 
wrong? All my spacc wasted and 
nothing done. Sorry, enemies, more 
next time.

Carnegie Conscious
A criticism frequently made about technical students is 
they are limited in their interests and that rthis narrow-minded
ness stays with them after graduation, causing them" to lose 
contact with everything that is happening outside of their own 
limited fields. 1 This accusation is, in many cases, just, but 
whether the situation becomes a deplorable one after the student 
leaves school is not what we now wish to discuss.
It is the interests of the undergraduate with which we are 
chiefly concerned, and more specifically, his interest in his 
school. The-lack of such feeling at Carnegie is the situation 
which we find deplorable. The  artist, is ,not. injuring his artis
tic ability\by'acquiring a few ideas as to what has been going 
on at Carnegie for the past; quarter Century, .and the student .of 
science will be no less capable for wanting to know these same 
things.
Carnegie, in its brief, twenty-five years, has had a remark
able history, one that might easily be called romantic. There 
are, however, surprisingly many whose knowledge of the' sub
ject consists of no more than the few facts that they remember 
from their orientation lecture.
With this issue the TARTAN.is beginning a series of articles 
devoted to the early history of Carnegie. These are to take 
the form of interviews with or accounts written by members 
of the faculty who have been at school since its inception. It 
is hoped by the.staff that these will not only be enjoyable read
ing but that they will also stimulate a desire among the stu
dents for a fuller knowledge of the subject. .

''ATHLETES FOOT
ON the floors of showers and 
locker rooms, there the 
little ringworm, parasite that 
causes ''Athletes Foot is right 
at home. Tinea trichophyton is 
the name, and in colleges as far 
apart as California^md Pennsyl
vania it has been found that 
50% of the men have it. Again, 
the U. S. Public Health Service 
reports that "at least half of 
all adults suffer from it at 
6ome time.
"Athletes Foot, golfers 
foot, toe itch, dobie-itchthere 
are many names for the same 
thing, and the symptoms are 
redness between the toes, with 
i-t-c*li-i-n-g or a thick, moist 
skin condition  or a dryness 
with little scales. The danger 
signals vary, but authorities 
agree that they arc all trace
able to the ringworm germ, 
tinea trichophyton.
It lurks in the very placcs 
where we all go for cleanliness 
and health  on the edges of 
swimming pools and showers  
in gymnasiumson lockerand 
dressing-room floors. In spite
of modern sanitation (you have 
to boil socks 15 minutes to kill 
it) this fungus parasite infects 
and re-infects bare feet almost 
any time they come in contact

Tests in a famous New York 
"lab have revealed that Absor

tissues deeply and that wher
ever impenetrates, it KILLS the

It might not be a bad idea to 
examine your feet tonight. At 
the first sign of the symptoms 
mentioned, douse on Absorbine 
Jr. And keep a bottle handy in 
your locker as a preventive. 
Use it after every exposure of

Think It Over
What Is a Mqdern High School? 
is the title of an article by Good
win Watson in The World T omorrow of October, 1930. The 
home town high school is a source 
of considerable local pride.  It has 
a new swimming pool. There is an 
auditorium'with a stage. Its labora
tories offer ' expensive breakables 
for use in physics. and chemistry. 
The school provides shop activi
ties and household arts equipment. 
Ninety per cent of the teachers 
have a bachelors degree. Never
theless adequate recognition of any 
of half a dozen established truths 
in educational science would revo
lutionize the school.
Mr. Watson believes that ninetenths of what istaught in the 
average high school is in need of 
reconstruction, and lie derides the 
teaching of such subjects as Latin 
and trigonometry which have long' 
ceased 'to be of any use to the 
average person.
He advocates a change in the 
curriculum to meet the needs o? 
modern adolescents rather than 
merely _'to see how much of the 
present chaff could be. justified. 
He would have six: main depart
ments in his ideal high school.
The Department of Health would 
be concerned with "both physical 
and mental health. Among the 
units it offered might ' be -muscle 
building,- complexion improving 
(choice of diet, first aid,- relaxation 
and rest, getting over the blues, 
avoiding inferiority feelings-, sc.lccting physicians, and lowering 
[community death rates, s Most of 
these, units would involve 'doing 
something, not merely talk about 
'health.
The Department pf Vocations 
would include the units which have 
a dir-cct bearing on the part of 
the pupils in the work of the 
world. For most pupils this would 
surely include .supervised partici
pation in some jobs. In addition, 
this area of the curriculum should 
provide the necessary preparation 
for those of professional bent. For 
some, physics' and chemistry and
it as soon as they finished reading 
. . . Delta Skull is going the way 
of all honoraries as they will soon 
blossom. forth in black dinks with 
grceii insignia . . . Bat Jacobs quali
fied as a ' radio announcer, at the 
Nixon restaurant Thursday night, and 
then came home and took all the 
rest, of the Sigma Nus down for a 
part}'. . . Kay Kaiser said he was 
glad to see his fellow lodge members 
. . . Legs Webster is being ac
cused of publicity-sccking 'because lie 
forgot to tell the Junior Class, pf 
which lie is President, of the Thistle 
picture appointment, and showed up 
by himself . . . The Pitt-Notre Dame 
game. was. watched by numerous Car
negie Tech students, including Misses 
Gertrude Novak and Betty Steele, 
also Messrs. Fox, Foote, Kissel, and 
Holvcckv . . . The two girls and 
Frank Foote had tickets.

mathematics; for7 others several 
languages or office skills may be 
demanded. Some of the units offered 
will survey the possible vocations 
for this generation in terms of 
the requirements for success, the 
service they render .and-he satis
factions they bring. Other units 
will call our present economic order 
up. for examination.
The Department of Leisure has 
the most important area of train
ing. With some -machines now 
producing more throughthe atten
tion of 100 men than was produced 
a year before by the labor of 8,000 
mcji, the six-hour day and the fiveday week arc not remote dreams. 
The .really challenging... task for 
ducation is the enrichment 
leisure. The modern high school 
will offer units in athletics, in 
producing plays,, making mcciianical 
models, reading literature, playin; 
music, dancing, telling stories, 
creating with rhythm, color, and 
form in every sort of medium. 
Travel and, for a few, foreign lan
guages and mathematics, may en
rich leisure. Special encourage
ment will be given to recreational 
athletics which can continue through
out life, to golf, tennis, swimming, 
and hiking rallier than basketball.
The Department of Home Par
ticipationFrankwood' Williams of 
the National Committee for Mental 
Hygiene has said that nothing else 
that an adolescent has to learn 
matters so much for future hap
piness as his parents and a normal 
interest in the opposite sex. It is 
the privilege of this department to 
'offer the reading, ;study, discussion, 
and activities which will lead to de
sirable ideals1 and practice in court 
^sliip and marriage., Other.. ,units 
might contribute to the election 
and purchase of household furnish
ings, making a budget work, care 
of babies, orlearning to enjoy 
younger brothers and sisters.
In the Department], of Citizen
ship would be grouped those enter
prises  through which an adoles
cent ^can contribute to the affairs 
of his 'town, state, country, and 
planet. This mean's the stud of 
government as it actually goes on 
in city councils, county court 
houses, and national assemblies. 
Politics are mainly matters of in
tense human concern. Few teach
ers of history have been bold 
cnoUgh to venture out upon stu
dent participation in modern affairs, 
letting history contribute what is 
really important for the under
standing of policies regarding pro
hibition, crime, immigration, di
vorce, tariff, League of Nations, 
government ownership, naval propa
ganda, and free speech. This is' 
dangerous business. But the mod
ern high school will be a stormcenter, not an isle of peaceful se
clusion from current life.
In his. optimistic conclusion, Mr. 
Watson says, Happily, and among 
educational utopias, strangely, this 
modern high school appears 'to be 
entirely feasible at the present time.

few of his spectacular runs, but the 
Violets took special precaution, and 
held them down to a smaller scale 
than usual. Throughout the game 
Karcis ^showed symptoms of" his 
superior 1928 form. -Big John^ was 
the backbone of the defense .and a 
dangerous threat on. the offense.' 
Captain Drcsha.r and Tank 'High-; 
berger held down, their side* of the 
line with the style of old-timers.
Violets Display Real Punch
The Violet jerseys presented a 
colorful sight as they gracefully 
stepped from their  military hud
dle to bear down on their smaller 
opponents * in the line. Coach 
Meehan presented a well-oiled ma
chine With no Scintillating stars, 
but with' that neccsarry quality of 
co-operation which is necessary to 
a winning team. They were' welldrilled in the fundamentals, and 
their baffling attack was fascinating 
to watch.
Joe La Mark, a visiting satellite 
playing at quarterback, employed a 
reverse' buck which, tiirie after 
time, resulted in profitable yardage 
through the left side of the line. It 
seems that Violets might have won 
the game with this line-smashing 
play alone. Bob McNamara, better 
remembered as Number 41, follow
ed his interference through the 
line, and, when left to his own 
resources, proved to be a clever 
runner with the knack of carrying 
the opposition before lie was down
ed. During his jaunts lie left 
many a would-be tackier .picking 
violets out of the ground instead 
of the line scrimmage.
The passing defense of both 
teams was as good as could be 
expected, and they were equally 
fortified in the kicking department. 
Several times 'when the whitc-helIf you had gone four years to a 
university, and studied during that 
period in a highly, specialized field, 
so specialized, in fact, that your 
knowledge would be absolutely use
less to you so far as earning a liv

to that institution for four more 
years of training to enable you to 
utilize your special training and so 
earn a living; and if that university 
had coldly turned you down and 
told you they had no room for you, 
how would you feel?
And yet, this-is exactly tit's plight 
which at least ten thousand college 
students are going to face bctzveen 
now and June. They are the most 
harassed of the undergraduates, the 
poor devils who plod up to the chem

order to rate with some fantastic 
demon of a science instructor.
The course is perhaps the hardest 
in the average school roster. The 
.Iris candidate views chemistry or 
geology with a shudder. They arc 
one of the dread sciences. They arc 
be taken for credit. .-I degree re
quires it, but that is all.
But the prcmedicohe must take 
chemistry, including general quantita
tive, qualitative, organic, and physi
cal; he must sweat under half a 
dozen zoology courses including cat 
anatomy, the vilest course ever con
ceived of by the deans of tncdical 
schools, histology, an cve slaughter
ing device of the devil, embryology, 
a mass of names couplcd with a 
mass of monotonous drawings-- 
whose purpose or mean jpg he is 
ignorant; and a dozen minor trifles 
like advanced psychology, chemistry 
of food stuffs, and similar tripe.
And what docs lie get for his 
pains?
The University of Pennsylvania has 
some 3,300 applicants; their fresh
man class number ii3. Jefferson has 
a list of perhaps 3,400, and admits 
1/5. of whom 30 or 40 fail at the 
end of the first year. Pitt's appli
cants are legion and she admits all 
of 63. Numerically, the chances of 
a prcmedic's admission to a class in 
 tncdical school arc no greater 
Ihnn one in twenty-jive.
And if lie docs not get in? His 
training has been absolutely ysclcss. 
Iiis superficial.chemistry courses arc 
far from adequate to get him a 
position ag a chemist. His biological

The great World Power Conference at Berlin had just 
concluded. Leading power men of the United States 
impatiently awaited its news. But, another important 
International Electro-technical Congress was to open 
the next day at Copenhagen.
The editor of Power had to cover both events :. . but 
his readers mustnt lose out. Boarding a huge Lufthansa 
Monoplane, he typed out the story of the Berlin Con
ference while soaring 5,000 feet above the Baltic Sea. 
That same evening at Copenhagen, he shot the news 
via cable to his waiting publication.
