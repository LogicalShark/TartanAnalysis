Scot Demands Explanation 
Of Its Suspension by SC
Wayman and Good Charge 
Tartan Article Was Unfair
by I>ick Christensen
Bill Wayman and Dutch Good, editor and business manager of the 
Scot, appeared at Council meeting last Wednesday to demand an 
explanation of the manner in which the publications constitution
was revoked. ?--------------------------------------------------------
In particular, Wayman asked
why he had not been notified of 
the meeting at which the action 
was taken. George Farneth, how
ever, stated that Dutch GoOd had 
been told of the impending revo
cation. Dutch then countered, The 
impression given me was that we 
would not be able to defend our
selves.
Contradiction
Good also called down the Tar
tan, saying, It was unfair, to the 
integrity of the Scot that articles 
were printed in the Tartan the 
way they were. He said that the 
figures given regarding the Scots 
financial status were wholly mis
leading, and that the total debt 
at the end of this year (including 
deficits from previous years) 
would amount to no more than 
$400.
. This was in direct contradiction 
to publications chairman Bob 
Mairs statement of two weeks ago 
that the total debt now stood at 
$935. This figure did not include 
some March bills nor the expect[Conilnued on page 9]

Biggest Carnival Ever 
Planned This Year
All signs point to one of the biggest and best Carnivals in Techs 
history as over 23 campus groups ready their entries in the sweep
stakes, booth, and varsity variety competitions. Late stragglers on
^the campus can hear the banging 
of hammers and the hoarse grunts 
of the straining buggy-pushers in
to the wee hours of the morning.
The Midway, open on Thursday 
at 4:30 as well as all day Friday 
and Saturday, will have all the 
old favorites as well as some new 
games of skill and chance calcu
lated to entice the long green out 
of holiday pockets. After all (and 
we dont deny it) whats Spring 
Carnival without a couple of cupie 
dolls for souvenirs.
Hot Tip
Pushmobile racing tipsters are 
putting odds on the Delts to re
peat their winning ways, but there 
may be some big surprises come 
Friday morning at 10 a.m. Several 
changes in the rules this year: 
each heat will feature three bug
gies instead of the previous two; 
only those buggies finishing in the 
top half of the race will be eligible 
for the design trophies. The com
mittee felt that one of the most 
important considerations in the 
design of a good buggy waa
LEADING A DOGS LIFE
Greeks Sacrifice Themselves 
For Spring Carnival Booths
Physical punishment for the Greeks seems to be the theme of 
several of the Carnival booths this year. Self-sacrificing members 
of four fraternities are the features for Konk a Kappa Sig, Dunk a 
Beta, Bombado, and Slap the Map of a Phi Kap. These brave
souls permit themselves to be hit 
with raw eggs and pies, doused 
with water, and dunked while 
wearing tuxedos.
Most of the other booths feature 
different games of chance and 
skill: the SAEs Skibol, a bowl
ing game; Sigma Nus OLearys 
Bar, in which you hit dummies 
with plates; the TX Tilt a Win, 
the golf booth of Tau Delta Phi; 
Pi Kappa Alphas Miniature 
Sweepstakes; and Delta Tau 
Deltas Bull in a China Shop. 
Something entirely new is to be 
added this year. The Delts are 
combining with the Thetas to put 
on a show called Spring Carnival 
Capers, a variety show which 
does a take-off on burlesque.
Richard Teare 
Former EE Head 
New E & S Dean
Dr. B. Richard Teare, Jr., for
mer head of the department of 
electrical engineering and pres

ministration and policy planning 
of E&S including the financial and 
educational developments.
Dr. Teares successor as head 
of electrical engineering is Dr. 
Everard M. Williams, a former 
professor in the department. The 
American Society of Engineering 
Education awarded Dr. Teare the 
George Westinghouse award in 
1947 for his distinguished contri

Draft Deferment Tests 
Will Be Given May 22
Major General Lewis B. Hershey, director of selective service, 
announced an additional Selective Service College Qualification Test 
to be held May 22 at 1,000 testing centers for the benefit of students 
prevented by illness, emergencies or some other reason from taking 
the test on December 13, 1951, or^
April 24 of this year.
Officials said they could not em
phasize too strongly that students 
who have admission ticket for 
either the December 13, 1951, or 
April 24 test which they failed to 
use'on the assigned date must sub
mit a new application if they wish 
to take the May 22 test. The old 
admission ticket, they pointed out, 
will not admit a student to the 
May 22 test.
Application blanks for the May 
22 test may be obtained by stu
dents from the nearest local board. 
They do not have to return home 
to the local board which has juris
diction over them. Application for 
the May 22 test should be mailed 
as soon as possible to the Educa
tional Testing Service, Princeton, 
New Jersey. Applications post
marked later than midnight May 
10, 1952, will not be accepted.
To be eligible to take the Selec
tive Service College Qualification 
Test, an applicant, on the testing 
date.(l) must be a selective serv
ice registrant who intends to re
quest deferment as a student; (2) 
must be satisfactorily pursuing 
a full-time college courseunder
graduate or graduateleading to 
a degree; (3) must not previously 
have taken the test.
General Hershey has urged all 
eligible students to take the test 
so they will have scores in their 
files when the local boards reopen 
their cases to determine whether 
or not they meet the criteria for 
deferment as students during the 
next academic year.
General Hershey also has re
peatedly stressed that no defer
ment is an exemption. A derferment is a delay or postponement, 
he said, and in no way cancels 
the duty of the registrant to meet 
his obligations.

Scotch 9n Soda 
Has An Interesting 
History At Tech
Since 1938 and its first produc
tion, No Spring, Scotch n Soda 
has attained nationwide approval 
as orte of the outstanding college 
musical organizations. With 
Heres To You in 1941 the club 
reached one of its high points 
when Variety, the theatrical news
paper, noted the show as some
thing outstanding in collegiate mu
sicals and Harold Cohen gave a 
rave review in the Post-Gazette.
Following the interim of the 
war years, Scotch n Soda came 
through with the fabulous Rock 
n Riot in 1947 and then Ladies 
At Work in 1948.
Seeking to expand its limited 
theater audience, Scotch n Soda 
(like the growing youngster that 
it is) moved to the Music Hall of 
Carnegie Institute in 1949, just 11 
years after its first production had 
appeared there.
After returning to the Carnegie 
Tech gymnasium the following 
year to produce a fine musical 
comedy, Techs theatrical organiza
tion availed itself of the nearby 
Schenley high school auditorium 
last year to present A Merry 
Chase, the story of two crooks 
and a pet wasp who attempted to 
corrupt the upstanding practices 
of an institution called Narcagie 
Tech.

Letters
Scots Viewpoint
After reading several articles in the Tartan, 
and talking to several students, there seemed to
this reporter to be a noticeable lack of any knowl
edge of the Scots point of view with regard to 
the recent revoking of its constitution. Therefore, 
a Tartan reporter interviewed the Editor-in-Chief 
of the Scot, Bill Wayman. Here is his side of the 
story.
Recently, there appeared on the front page of 
the Tartan a headlineStudent Council Hashes 
Over Scot Organization. In the three sentences 
that followed, it was casually mentioned that ac
tion to revoke the Scots constitution would be 
taken at a later meeting. In last weeks Tartan, 
another headline appeared (this time on page four) 
SC Discontinues Scot without even a word of 
explanation. The editors were not informed of 
these Council meetings, nor were they invited to 
be present to give information in defense of the 
Scot. This complete neglect of the staff of the Scot 
and their point of view has given the students a 
one-sided idea of the workings of the Scot, which 
has been furthered by an editorial in the Tartan 
which was not only sarcastic and unethical, but so 
far-fetched as to be ridiculous.
First of all, there was no one-man army on the 
Scot. There was a staff of 13 editors, each of whom 
did their individual jobs and their part to put out 
a Scot. It is not an easy job to get ads, arrange 
to sell the magazine, and run the business end of 
the publication. No one man could possibly do it, 
and no one man did do it.
The Tartan mentioned that the Scot had not 
met costs and Student Council would have a $900 
debt to assume at the end of the year. The article 
forgot to say that the Scot had a $1300 debt at 
the beginning of the year. This omission deliber
ately gave the student body the impression that 
the Scot has lost money this year. The Scot has 
made money, not lost it.
In addition to the $1300 debt the Scot started 
out with this year, there were other handicaps. 
The reputation of the Scot was such that no one 
considered it an honor to be associated with it. 
Many of the incoming Freshmen were afraid of re
flection upon them if they were on the staff and 
another issue was banned. The staff also faced 
the problem of converting the Scot from a humor 
magazine to the variety magazine prescribed by 
the school, with more features and jokes used 
only as fillers. These factors combined to produce 
a need for feature writers and, at the same time, 
a lack of them. The system for procuring writers 
for the magazine was not adequate to combat the 
bad publicity which surrounded the Scot, and there
fore the magazine was not able to give the student 
body the features which would satisfy the students 
and still please the administration. Although there 
has been nothing which could have been considered 
risque in this years Scots, the Tartans editorial 
persisted in calling attention to the unclean jokes 
of past year. There has been no attempt made 
on the part of the student organizations to~help the 
Scotto make it the magazine which the students 
want.
Regardless of whether or not the Scot will be 
published next year, this reporter hopes that this 
article will clear up the confusion which has been 
caused by the one-sided, inadequate information 
which the student body has received.

Editorial
Begin The Year Right
Student Council has been doing commendable work this 
semester trying to revise all the antiquated clauses in its 
by-laws, and last week this program reached out to do a 
little changing on the freshman orientation rules. The changes 
will all be looked upon as minor and will have little overall 
effect, because Council cannot get at the root of all the evil. 
The viewpoint that CITs policy of instantaneous rushing does 
considerable damage to orientation attempts is held by quite 
a few on this campus; and many other campuses have done 
away with first semester rushing because of this interference.
In a booklet issued recently by the National Student As
sociation, many arguments were presented against first semester 
rushing. It claimed that the poor freshman is hit on all sides 
the minute he sets his feet on campus and is immediately faced 
with the seemingly more important decision of choosing the 
assortment of Greek letters he prefers instead of becoming ad
justed to the college life and atmosphere before his classes be
gin. This is an important step in college life, and if it was done 
more slowly, the mortality rate at the end of the first semester 
might be less.
And all the hardships dont fall on the poor frosh; one 
look at the upperclass Greeks the week school begins would 
verify this. The long week of pumping hands, finding dates, 
and attending 2 a.m. rushing meetings takes its toll on all 
concerned, and when the first Monday of classes rolls around, 
all are worn out instead of fresh for the new semester. Rush
ing doesnt end with the beginning of school either, but in 
some cases runs on as long as a month. While the actives 
dont have to become adjusted to school, it would help their 
cause more if they could settle down to work before the mid
semesters arrive.
If the plebe had a chance to become acquainted with 
CIT through the orientation program, develop his own pro
portion of time for study purposes, etc., and choose his own 
extra-curricular activities without the always present, knowit-all guiding hand, he would be much more prepared for 
school and even for rushing when the second semester rolls 
around. The spirit of the traditions exam and other orien
tation functions could be much better * preserved if a few 
things were left to the new freshman to find out for himself.
Each year the program of delayed rushing is discussed or 
at least brought up in the Council of Fraternity Presidents. It 
always seems as though everyone agrees with all the programs 
principles, but for one minor reason or another the decision
is always postponed. Last year the main objection was that the 
houses would lose a good sized proportion of their income when 
the senior class graduated, and in order to operate economically, 
the revenue from a new pledge class would be needed imme
diately in the fall. With the draft scare last spring, none of the 
houses were even sure how many of the underclassmen would 
be returning. It was suggested, though, that the houses begin 
to rush this past year so that they would have enough men next 
fall to run if delayed rushing were adopted.
Its hard to tell if this has been done or not; but every
one is pretty sure of his draft status now, and the houses 
should have been prepared, so there was no explained reason 
why delayed rushing wasnt adopted for next fall. Its too 
late now, but we believe that Carnegies CFP owes it to 
the incoming freshmen, their parents, and itself to adopt 
a policy of not jamming everything into the orientation 
week.
Letters
Council Explains Stand
Editor, the Tartan:
Since Student Council revoked the Scots con
stitution two weeks ago, numerous people have 
asked me why this action was taken.
In the first place, the Scot, while supposing tc^ 
be a variety magazine, has presented very little in 
the way of true variety, and certainly nothing new, 
different, or exciting. In part this is the fault of the 
editor in relying on only a trusted few to produce 
the book. But it is also due to a lack of interest 
on the students part. So the fact remains that the 
editor has"* had to badger people into writing for the 
magazine. Now, can this magazine, which exists 
to benefit only a few, be called a creative out
let?
Secondly, even though the Scot has made a 
little profit this year, it has, during the past three 
years, run up a debt of about a thousand dollars. 
Council also has had to assume large deficits in
curred by the Scotty and the Puppet. This fact 
does not support the popular theory that if the 
administration would let the Scot publish a smutty 
magazine such as the now non-existent Pitt Pan
ther, or MITs Voodoo, circulation would be im
mensely increased. It seems that each type of 
magazine appeals to members of a certain group, 
and for this reason it will be purchased only by 
that group to which it appeals.
In short, the staffs of the Scot and the Scotty 
have proved in the past that they cannot publish 
a magazine which will at least break even finan
cially. Along this same line, what will happen 
next year when there are 200 fewer students to 
sell to and to pick staff members from?
We are not banning the Scot forever. We are 
only saying that it should be banned until the stu
dents and the editorial staff, by showing a true 
interest in the Scot, prove thata fourth publication 
can be supported.
Yours truly,
Bob Mair
Student Council publications chairman.
CIT Elections Farce
Editor, the Tartan:
The time has come for someone to speak out 
against the farce the elections on this campus have 
become. We of Womens Dormitory Council feel 
that it is our duty as the governing body of Car
negie Tech women to bring this to the attention 
of all.
The original purpose of elections on our campus 
was to furnish a spirit of good, clean competition, 
that should be fun for all groups participating, 
and not the cut-throat feeling that now exists, 
whereby, one group will stoop to any practice to 
out-do another. Another point in the original pur
pose of elections was that each person would be 
entitled to his own vote, and only his own vote. 
A registration card, which entitles a person to 
vote, is given to one person, and only the person 
who owns the registration card has the right to use 
it in an election. The lending and borrowing of 
registration cards is practiced by some people, and 
in this situation the person that lends his card is 
as guilty of illegal voting as the person who bor
rows it.
Instead of doing something about this situa
tion the student body has lost respect for election 
results and accepts them warily, feeling that they 
do not represent a true picture of the feelings' of 
the student body. The students that win an election 
by these means will certainly never meet the cri
terion for good citizens in a democracy where the 
criteria is equal representation and honesty. Edu
cation is supposed to lay the foundation for good 
citizens, but in some cases it has failed miserably. 
Students who use this method of winning elections 
are certainly not fit to be the leaders on campus, 
let alone in our democracy. Students that win elec
tions by these unscrupulous means certainly should 
not, we feel, be able to congratulate themselves on 
their ill-won victory. It is up to everyone as citi
zens and students to make these illegal devices 
during elections a thing of the past.
Respectfully yours,
. Womens Dormitory Council
Ed, Note
In gathering information for the One-Man 
Army editorial, the editor spoke to a number of 
past workers on the Scots staff, all of whom resign
ed within the past two years. The general concensus 
of opinion by all was that which was expressed in 
the editorial last week. Also, the figures published 
in the Tartan concerning the Scots financial status 
were obtained from Student Council and assumed 
to be correct. In the later case the Tartan was at 
fault in assuming this correctness, but it seemed 
af this time to be the right procedure since Council 
handles the Scots budget. Maybe we have too 
many hands in the stew, the Tartan wasnt the only 
body confused in thi* recent figure shuffle.

Double Wins; Carman Sets Record
Foreign soil made no difference to coach Guy Hal fortys track 
team Saturday as it ground out its fourteenth consecutive dual win 
and its fifth straight this year with a 88-42 walloping of the Al
legheny Gators. ?---------------------------------------------------------
Tartan Bob Carman was the 
limelight occupant of the day as 
he scored a double victory in the 
mile and two-mile and set a track 
record in the latter for the second 
consecutive meet. Carman toured 
the long grind in 10:14.5 which 
was five seconds off his recordbreaking Geneva performance but 
still good enough for an Allegheny 
mark.
Johnny Luchok turned in his 
usual outstanding performance as 
he won the 100 yd. dash, the broad 
jump, and anchored the winning 
relay team.
In the field events Chuck Tay
lor turned in a double win with 
firsts in the shotput and discus on 
throws of 42 and 118. Other Plaid 
winners were Dave Douglass in 
the 880, Charlie Bell in the 220,
Englehart in the 440 and Gerry

Tennis Team Extends Win 
Streak To Four Straight
Defeat Grove City, Titans,
Bethany By Lopsided Margin
Coach Frank Moses took the Carnegie Tech netters to Grove 
City on Saturday and sparked them to another win with an 8-1 tri
umph over the Grovers. It extended the Tartan winning streak to 
four wins without loss for this season.
The players are not celebrating, 
however, as they have their two
hardest matches coming up this 
week with Allegheny and Pitt.
The Tartans swept all but one 
match from the Grovers, Saturday, 
in posting their fourth victory. 
Walt Poe was the only Plaid los
er, 6-4, 6-8, 6-4, in a match with
WESTMINSTER
The Carnegie Tech tennis team 
took another step along the victory 
road with a convincing 7-2 de
cision over the Westminster Titans 
on the Plaid courts last Wednes
day.
The Scots clinched the verdict 
in the single matches, copping five 
of the six set-tos. Captain Bob 
Wiederhorn, Jim Miller, A1 Glaser, 
Mahlon Saibel, and Don Duncklee 
all emerged victors. Bob Duffus 
suffered the lone Tartan defeat.
The Titans received little con
solation in the doubles matches 
as the Tartans piled on two more 
wins. Saibel and Duffus and Staufenberg and Rugheimer made their 
%jL appearances as doubles part
ners successful by decisioning 
their Westminster opponents.
Veterans Finder and Cederstrom 
suffered a reverse fate as they 
were upset by their foes.

Coming Events
With Carnegie experienc
ing an outstanding year in 
athletics, the sports staff is 
printing the schedule of var
sity events each week. For the 
coming week the schedule is 
as follows:
Day Sport Place
Mon. Golf Carnegie
Wed. Track Meet W & J
Wed. Golf Duquesne
Thurs. Tennis Carnegie
The Tartan team advanced into 
the victory bracket by downing 
Slippery Rock 8-12, 15-8, 14-12. 
They then continued their winning 
streak by defeating California 
S.T.C. 8-3, 12-5, and then down
ing Pitt by a score of 8-4, 5-10, 
10-8.
As the Carnegie net men enter
ed the finals they were required to 
play Slippery Rock again for the 
championship. Since Carnegie had 
beaten them once, the game was 
not taken seriously and Carnegie 
lost 9-7, 14-6.
As a result the two teams were 
required to play another sudden 
death game. This ended in one 
of the most spectacular games of 
the tournament with Carnegie 
Tech coming out on top by a score 
of 15-13.
Geneva Is 
92-39 Victim 
On Tuesday
Carman Breaks Track 
Record In Two-Mile 
Run With 10:07 Time
Bob Carman, junior physicist, 
broke the Geneva track record in 
the two mile run with a 10:07 time 
last Tuesday afternoon at Beaver 
Falls.
Former Covy runner Chuck Fee, 
now assistant track coach, held 
the previous record for the field, 
10:11. In setting the pace for his 
record breaking run, Carman 
lapped every other entrant except 
Arne Olds, who finished about 
three-quarters of a lap behind 
Carman and took second place.
Duncan Stars
Covy ace Oswald Duncan outdid 
all his teammates, copping first 
place in both the high and low 
hurdle events. Lew Wetzel took 
second in both hurdle races. Paul 
Smith finished third in the highs 
for the Plaid, and Don Wood oc
cupied the number three spot in 
the lows.
The Plaid showed to a good ad
vantage in the field events, as Tay
lor copped first in both the shot 
and discuss heaves. Luchok took 
the broad jump and Bateman 
wrapped up the pole vault. Mc
Farland and Pettite won the high 
jump and javelin throw for 
Geneva.
In the opening event of the 
meet, Bob Caiman ran the mile 
in 4:35 to win that event as an ap
petizer for his record smashing 
two mile jaunt. Genevas Jackson 
placed second, and Chuck Gough 
took third for the Tartans.
Englehart Cops
In the 440 yard run, Dick Engle
hart set the pace with a 54.5 time 
and Vic Valias came third for the 
Plaid. Second place went to Rich
ards of the Covies.
The Tartan relay team again 
came through with a win as the 
combination of Bell, Englehart, 
Valias, and Luchok finished about 
half a lap ahead of Genevas entry.

29 Teams Enter IM 
Softball Competition
With the kinks worked out of players arms by the ideal spring 
weather, intramural softball moved into its first week of play last 
week with 29 teams participating in the campus version of the great 
American sport.
In the Plaid league Phi Kappa, Beta Theta Pi, and ASCE 
each marked opening week victories to tie for the league leader
ship. Tau Delta Phi after being edged in its initial game, 2-1, 
by the Phi Kaps bounced back in a later contest to slaughter 
the Avengers 10-2. In a wild slugfest marked by a comedy of 
errors the ASCE team won over the MEs 15-11, in another Plaid 
league game.
Play in the Skibo league saw Sigma Nu No. 1 and Theta Xi 
A tied for the first week lead with two victories and no defeats 
for each. The two are slated to clash today in one of the most in
teresting games scheduled this week. In another Skibo league game 
the Demons slugged it out with the Isentropics to gain a narrow 
10-9 decision.
The Raiders were leading the Tartan league play along with 
ATO A at the end of the week as the Raiders squeezed out 
an important win over Delta Tau Delta in a close contest. The 
Chem Es and the Kappa Sigs were idle during the week in the 
Tartan league. In the Thistle league the Slugs edged out ATO 
B by 10-9 and the DUs went down in a free-swinging contest 
with the Newman Club by a 13-8 score.
Soccer Finale
Bob Weddells opportune drive in the opening minutes of the 
game gave the ATO an early first quarter lead, 1-0, over Sigma Nu 
in its successful bid for the Carnegie intramural soccer crown.
Kay Thompson retaliated for Sigma Nu late in the initial 
period when a hard drive evaded the arms of ATO goalie, Phil 
Jeske. The half ended in a draw, 1-1.
In the third quarter, during a heavy scrimmage in front of 
Sigma Nu goal, Ed Connelly, the goalie, was screened from the play 
and Tom Astle, ATO lineman, was able to push a slow roller into 
the cage before anything could be done about it, for a 2-1 lead.
The second half was featured by a series of long defensive 
kicks, as the ATOs went on the defensive in an effort to retain 
their lead. Sigma Nu began to lag in the last period, and only 
once did they threaten to score. Kay Thompson had the ball in 
the clear about 10 yards from the goal, but cleared his shot off 
to one side.
The game ended in a burst of attacks as the ATOs switched 
again to the offensive to strengthen their lead, and the Sigma Nus 
strove to rgain the tie. No scoring occurred and ATO won the IM 
soccer crown from the Sigma Nu squad in a 2-1 battle.
Later this month the ATOs will have an opportunity to test 
their ability when they meet the campus champions from Pitt 
to decide the Forbes Street title.
Horseshoe Competition
Following a tense week of eliminations, the horseshoe competition 
was narrowed down to three teams. Bill Repovz & Bob Rinaldi drew 
a bye while Lorne Robinson & A1 Davis dropped Vito Tricarito & 
Vince Cekela into third place. Robinson & Davis continued their win
ning ways to bypass Repovz & Rinaldi for the campus title.
Champions: Lorne Robinson and A1 Davis
Runners-up: Bill Repovz and Bob Rinaldi
Third Place: Vince Cekela and Vito Tricarito
Bridge, Handball
In the final round of the IM bridge tournament, the 4 Deuces 
narrowly edged Phuggs Bearcats, 9-8, for the Plaid crown.
Faculty members Ray Parshall & Bob Meachem displaced the 
Beaver entry in the handball tournament, 2 matches to none. Par
shall dropped Jack Reamey two straight games, 21-18 and 21-9, while 
Jim Vodenichar pushed Meachem to the three game limit before 
losing, 15-21, 21-7, and 21-5.

CIT Observes Tech Week 
With Large Open House
From the military supply room to the bowels of Machinery Hall ? 
and the confines of Maggy Murph last Thursday could be found dis
plays erected as Carnegies contribution to Pittsburghs Technology 
week. Every department endeavored to show the major aims of its 
individual educational program ?; 
and other interesting sidelights 
with exhibits which represented 
many weeks of planning and pre
paration.
. CITs observance began early in 
the afternoon and ran until 9 in 
the evening with a fairly large 
turnout from the community but 
a poor showing from the student

the observance went all out, and 
as a result produced displays dif
ferent from the average and capa
ble of holding everyones interest.
Where To Start?
Anyone looking at all the in
formation signs wasnt able to de
cide where to start, there really 
wasnt a beginning or an ending.
Over in Engineering Hall the 
Chem Es displayed a room adver
tised as 330 degrees cooler inside 
where they showed several experi
ments done with liquid nitrogen.
The process of fractional distilla
tion was demonstrated In another 
room.
Deep down in the caverns of EH 
where the metallurgical engineers 
hang out, the art of rolling hot 
steel was shown on the depart
mental rolling mill. Two of the 
metallurgists were kept busy jug
gling a red hot piece of steel back 
and forth through the mill.
Civil Display

land was given anyone who cared 
to look into the radarscope. A
million volts of man-made light
ning sparked around in the DC 
machinery lab and made hearing 
almost impossible.
CIT was spelled out by the 
cooling tubes of a York Ice Ma
chine in one of the mechanical en

tators commented on the bounc

one, but they stood by and watch
ed the automobile model being 
continually rocked by simulated 
road bumps.
Pamphlet Flood
If one of the trustees went 
through the civil engineers dem
onstration, he probably had a fit 
watching the huge amount of 
water flowing out of the weir from 
the dam model and thinking of 
next months water bill. In an
other part of the civil lab steel 
specimens were being broken in 
the tension testing machins.
Mathematics and industrial 
management found it hard to set 
up any display that would have 
much spectator appeal, but the 
IMs had a field day passing out 
a considerable amount of litera

School Will Have Two 
Johns Next Semester
by John J. John, Jr., as told to Dick Durstine
Those readers of the Tartan who are interested in campus activi
ties and'problems will be glad to learn that next year there will 
be two Johns at Carnegie Tech. This should do much to ease some 
of the problems which have occurred in the past months.
My little brother, Guglielmo*
John, who will graduate from the 
Waterloo boys industrial school 
this June, is planning to enroll at 
Carnegie in the department of 
roots and herbs.
A Letter Home 
I therefore feel it my duty to 
write to this youth, since he is 
of my own flesh and blood, and 
advise him of the things to come 
in the months that will follow. 
Dear Guglielmo,
Congratulations on being ac
cepted at Carnegie Tech. You have 
chosen one of the nations foremost 
engineering institutions.
pus, and meet everyone who is 
anyone, and most of those who 
arent. But you will not remember 
their names, and they will not re
member yours, and in two weeks 
the only person who will call you 
by name will be an insignificant 
instructor in the department of 
astrology, who will cal you 
Fruylingshuysen when he picks 
on you to recite.
But soon you will become hap
pily installed, and settle down to 
a year of toil studying the sci
ence of roots and herbs. For this 
you will need a briefcast, preferThis summer you will doubtless ahly a.ful1 0ne> a.36 inch slide

cleverly disguised under such titles 
as Announcements for 1952-53/'' 
and "General Informations for En
tering Students. In order to be 
safe, let us look at these with the 
candid eye of the alchemist.
First of all you will receive sev
eral forms. Fill these out as they 
are important. One will go to Dr. 
Johnson N. Johnson, head of the 
health department; another to the 
bureau measurement and guid
ance (which will measure and 
guide you on your arrival), and 
one the registrars office.
These will be followed by a 
bulletin from the dormitories de
scribing something called the 
FPHA housing units, complete 
with game rooms and ample 
closet space. The whole room is, 
in fact, a closet, and the occupant 
must hang himself on a nail in 
the wall every evening before go
ing to sleep.
Other publications will praise 
the merits of the Carnegie Plan, 
a ruse by which good instructors 
must work hard, and by which 
poor ones can live a life of ease. 
Be careful of the Carnegie Plan, 
it may make a well-rounded per
son out of you. And if there is any
thing which an engineer must not 
be, it is a well rounded person.
Then will come the letters from 
the fraternities, a word which 
comes from the Greek meaning 
Too lazy to walk all the way to 
the Greeks.3 Each of these will 
berate all the others for being too 
anxious for new members, state 
that its only aim is to help you 
adjust yourself to campus life, 
and proceed to relate what a 
great bunch of guys the fellows 
at old Sigma Zoo are.
These barrages will also in
clude personal invitations to as
sorted dinners, parties, dances, and 
picnics. It is all right to go to 
these, since they are free. But be
ware, someone has to pay for these 
things later. It may be you. If 
anyone asks you to come upstairs 
for a minute, a couple of the boys 
would like to talk to you, it will 
be well to suddenly remember an 
appointment with the dean (any 
dean, there are 97 of them).

Tartan Staff Builds A Buggy, 
Plan To Sweep Sweepstakes
By Bob McQuaide
At long last the supersonic pushmobile has arrived on the horizon. 
The Tartan staff, tiring of the slow, gay ninety-ish ice wagons con
ceived by the various fraternities and organizations on campus, has 
designed a futuramic speed wagon with which they plan to sweep
the sweepstakes. The buggy,?---------------------------------------------------------
which the Architecture Depart
ment has lauded as a masterpiece 
of advanced automotive design, 
was built with the aid of such 
well known figures as John J. 
John, Jr., famed irregular al
chemist at Tech who recently at
tained national recognition for his 
exposes in the Tartan, and Rege 
Cordics little Venusian pal, 
Omicron.
The sleek needle-nosed racer, 
outwardly patterned after the 
XF-791 Air Force rocket ship, has 
some very unique developments in 
its mechanical operation. Mr. John 
suggested that some of the frictionless pulleys belonging to the 
Physics Department be borrowed 
for use as wheels so that no costly 
bearings would be needed to re
duce friction. The two burglars 
charged $25, but the frictionless 
pulleys were procured.
Catch Saucers
The buggy is expected to exceed 
150 m.p.h. because of an innova
tion which came as a result of a 
trip to Saturn. Two weeks ago, 
Omicron went camping in the Satumian Rockies, and during his 
stay there happened to trap two 
wild flying saucers. When - he 
brought them back to this health
ful Pittsburgh spring weather, the 
two mated and  produced four 
lovely baby saucers which are just 
the right size for hub caps for the 
racer. Because of its natural vio
lent spin, each little dessert plate 
acts as a tiny motor on the wheel, 
with the provision that it is fed 
its porridge, a mash consisting of 
Skibo coffee and aged ashes from 
Ben Davids pipe. Their best fea
ture is that having no apparent 
motor, they can not cause the 
speedster to' be disqualified for 
having an engine.
Another change from the ordina
ry is the radically new type axle 
used in its construction. Needing 
something hard enough to take
the beating given by the frictionless pulleys, the staff obtained at 
great expense (a seat full of buck
shot) the thigh bones from a Diplodocus Apatosaurus which for
merly resided in the Carnegie 
Museum.
Uses Porridge
The cockpit is regally furnished 
with upholstry of Australian alli
gator and a hand-carved steering 
wheel of ivory inlaid ebony. With 
bowls of highly inflammable por
ridge for the hub caps on all sides, 
there is naturally no smoking in 
the cockpit. To emphasize this 
fact, the ash trays automatically 
retract into the fire wall whenever 
a hand reaches toward them. An
other feature is the radar set 
which not only points out all love
ly girls and whistles at them, but 
also electronically turns on an au
tomatic pilot to steer the pushmo
bile while the driver gawks. The 
automatically retractable antenna 
was constructed from a piece of 
the Pitt Cathedral. Since both a 
fox and a horse tail were avail
able to decorate it, the horse tail 
was draped on it because it was 
more at home on the Inverted 
Mine Shaft.
In order to be more loyal to 
CIT, the Tartan staff has drilled 
holes in the handles of the pushmobile. The wind whistling 
through these holes will play 
Fight for the Glory of Carnegie 
as this plaid pushmobile zooms 
through scenic Schenley Park and 
flashes, with a skirl of bagpipes, 
first across the finish line.

ed profits from the Carnival issue.
Dick Franklin then emphasized 
again that he did not feel that 
money was the primary issue, but 
that the Scot was not-fulfilling its 
proper function as a college mag
azine.
Good-Sized Staff
Wayman, commenting on 
Franklins implied accusation that 
the magazine exists for only a few 
people, stated, There is a goodsized staff. The one-man army ar
ticle (in last weeks Tartan) was 
asinine. In summary he declared, 
The main objection we have is 
the manner in wnich this matter 
was handled.
The upshot of all this verbal 
battle was Curhans resolution that 
next semesters officers be in
structed to notify those concerned 
of any business coming up before

THINKING OF TRAVELING?
Einert Address Gives 
Hope For Handicapped
by George J. McChesney
Speaking before first year group work students in the depart
ment of social work, Miss Dora M. Einert, director of a recreation 
program for physically handicapped children in Detroit, outlined a 
program of recreation for handicapped children which has enlisted
the interest of orthopaedic clinics ?---------------------------------------------------
throughout the nation.
The problems encountered in 
growing up are intensified for the 
severely handicapped child, Miss 
Einert said. He needs help in 
overcoming his feelings of inse
curity, which add an emotional 
handicap to his physical one. 
Polio Hits Later
On the whole cerebral palsy 
children havent known anything 
else but their crippled condition. 
They are usually stricken before 
birth, or during about the first 
four years. Victims of polio and 
muscular distrophy, which strike 
later in life and affect the spine, 
have known use of their limbs. 
They are more acutely concerned 
with their condition, said Miss 
Einert, than the cerebral palsy vic
tim.
Many times their difficulties are 
intensified by a staring public. 
People have a kindly interest and 
mean well, but staring often pro
duces internal conflict, too. Per
haps one of the greatest obstacles 
faced by crippled children and 
adolescents, she added, is that the
public is often persuaded that 
there is nothing that it can do.
Give Bright Hope
In the Detroit recreational pro
gram, Miss Einert and her staff 
give them the bright hope of bet
ter social conditions. They do so 
by getting a desirable equilibrium 
between aggressive feelings and 
acceptance of a physical handicap. 
The program, which is adjustive 
in nature, is organized around 
group workers who are trained in 
psychology and psychiatry.
In the Detroit program, the 
group worker is aided by students 
from Wayne University who are 
required to pursue 100 hours in 
community service. These stu
dents are designated as leaders. At 
first the child is handled individu
ally because he is usually strange 
and withdrawn in his new sur
roundings.
Some Marry
Subsequently the Club House 
program becomes a steppingstone 
for these children and adolescents 
and leads them to normal social 
life in the community. Many of 
them pair off in dates and marry. 
No attempt is made to keep them
beyond their need for the. pro 
gram, Miss Einert stated.
Miss Einert taught at Tech from 
1928 to 1943. She was also asso
ciated with the United Neighbor 
hood Houses in New York City, 
the USO, and the Childrens Division of the Menninger Clinic in 
Topeka, Kansas, before taking over 
position.

Spring Carnival, 
Semester Exams 
Around Corner
Spring has finally arrived, and 
with it the inevitable final ex
ams again loom on the horizon. 
Consolation, is the fact that with 
them over, most of us have three 
months of glorious summer free
dom in which to build up for the 
next onslaught on the Carnegie 
Plan in the Fall.
Spring Carnival, the high-light 
of the Day School social calendar 
will be here next week. Although 
we at Evening School are not 
around to participate in all the 
frivolity, tickets are available to 
interested Evening students for 
the dances and Scotch and Soda 
show. Those interested should 
contact Mr. McKelways office.

Be Happy-GO LUCKY!
In a cigarette, taste 
makes the difference  
and Luckies taste better!
The difference between just smoking and 
really enjoying your smoke is the taste of a 
cigarette. You can taste the difference in the 
smoother, mellower, more enjoyable taste of a 
Lucky ... for two important reasons. First, 
L.S. / M.F.T.Lucky Strike means fine tobacco 
... fine, mild tobacco that tastes better. Second, 
Luckies are made to taste botter... proved bestmade of all five principal brands. So reach for a 
Lucky. Enjoy the cigarette that tastes better!
