in lecture
by Pete Levin
The legacy of Watergate is that it will 
be a long time before we will have another 
one, John Dean, counsel to former Pres
ident Richard M. Nixon, said at an Activ
ities Board lecture in the Skibo Ballroom 
last Tuesday.
Dean spent two hours discussing and 
fielding questions on his involvement in 
the Watergate scandal. The talk was en
titled Watergate: Can it Happen
Again?
Dean opened his talk with a definition 
of Watergate, saying, it was ...not one 
event, but a cluster of events that, taken 
together, form a litany of activity that is 
an unfortunate chapter in the history of 
our country. That list would include such 
things as the break-in and taping of the 
Democratic National Committee Head
quarters, the abuse of agencies of the gov
ernment like the IRS, the CIA, and the 
FBI, the use of agent provocateurs, [and] 
the use of electronic surveillance against 
newsmen which occurred during the Nixon 
presidency.
Dean went on to point out that a major 
part of the actual scandal was the coverup, an area he confessed to have a certain 
amount of expertise I truly wish I was not 
in a position to share with you. He related 
an assignment that former President Nixon 
gave him in which he was to find some 
dirty linen; things that prior presidents 
had done that would make Watergate look 
good. I looked back and did find past 
presidents abusing the office or making
erested audience about his political career.
purely political use of it. He noted an im
portant difference: Almost all the activit
ies that you could include in Watergate you 
could find some variation of in some other 
presidency... [but] where in the past they 
were the exception to the rule, somehow 
they became the rule during the Nixon 
presidency. So I have trouble saying that it 
was just the same old tiling and these 
people simply got caught.
In extending his definition of Watergate, 
Dean stated that Watergate was the Superbowl of political scandals in our coun
tryit received more media attention and 
media hype than any event of its kind in 
many decades. He said many of his 
friends in the Washington press corps were 
suffering from withdrawal symptoms; 
they now lacked the vast amount of mat
erial they once had during the Watergate 
era and that the public must keep the 
media aspect in mind when reviewing 
Watergate.

The future of business is determined 
in the board rooms of America, said 
Harold M. Williams, Chairman of the 
Securities Exchange Council.
Williams and Irving S. Shapiro, Chair
man of E.I.duPont de Nemours & Com
pany, were the lecturers at a Fairless 
Lecture titled, Power and Accountabi
lity; The Changing Role of the Board of 
Directors. The lecture, held on October 
24, was one of a series of lectures given in 
honor of Benjamin Fairless, a former 
trustee of Carnegie Institute of Techno
logy.
After a brief explanaiion regarding the 
origins of the series by CMU President 
Richard M. Cyert, Provost Arnold Weber 
introduced the two speakers to the stand
ing room only crowd in the Skibo Ball
room.
In his opening remarks, Shapiro stated 
his support for the present programs of 
corporate governance, My position is 
that signigicant improvements have been 
made in corporate governance, and that 
more changes, are coming in an orderly 
way; that with these amendments, cor
porations are accountable and better 
monitored than ever before; and that pat 
formulas or proposals for massive restucturing should be suspect. He does not 
think the interests of the public are neces
sary in the internal affairs of corporations,
Irving Shapiro, Chairman of duPont Company 
addressed the large audience in the Skibo Ballroom, gathered for the Fairless lectures.
but that public support and opinion is 
vital to the well being of the company. 
Corporate governance is not an issue for 
corner drugstores, he said. In viewing 
the board of directors of corporations 
Shapiro feels their duties are; the deter
mination of the broad policies of the 
.enterprise, the establishment of perfor
mance standards against which the manage
ment will be judged, the rewiew of top 
managements performance, and the com
munication of the organizations goals 
and of the steps being taken to keep the

Cyert addresses trustees
by Jean Fellegini
We have the chance to get considerably 
more pledges within the next few months, 
President Richard Cyert said', speaking on 
the Investments in Progress Campaign at 
the October 15 meeting of the Board of 
Trustees held at the Mellon Institute. Cyert 
expressed his thanks for the significant in
creases of the personal pledges by several 
trustees, and appealed to the Board for 
their continued support of the campaign.
The major business of the meeting was 
the approval of the 1979 CMU financial 
report. Before the vote was taken, Cyert 
highlighted several points of the report, 
notably the long-term debt liability includ
ing $ 1.6 million for the Margaret Morrison 
apartment building and another $ 1 million 
for an energy project. He then commented 
on the income statement, pointing out the
fact that tuition income increased from 
1978 because of the greater number of stu
dent^ and higher tuition rate. Sponsored 
research income for engineering was down, 
but he expects a significant increase over 
the next two years. Endowment and gifts 
and grants income also decreased from last 
year.
Looking at the 1979 expenses, Cyert lis
ted several key expenditures:
-$50,000 for library acquisition of new 
books and journals;
-Physical plant expenses that were up by 
$250,000 because of last years bad winter;
-High utility costs, which included a 
$100,000 retroactive assessment.
Financial aid allocations were up 12% 
from 1978, and administration expenses 
rose slightly with expected increases in the

Carnival chairman appointed
by Andre W. Jenkins
Dave Mongeau hasbeen appointed Chair
person for Spring Carnival at CMU this 
year. He is a senior in Technical Writing 
and a member oV the Delta Upsilon Frat
ernity. Mongeau has worked on the Activ
ities Board executive staff since his fresh
man year. As chairperson for Spring Carn
ival, Dave will be working with CMU grad
uate Anne Witchner, who is Director of 
Student Activities.
Mongeau plans to improve this years 
Carnival by directing more events toward 
the campus as a whole. He hopes to in
crease participation on the whole so that 
more individuals can be part of Carnival 
activities. We want the opening ceremonies 
at Midway to be big this year, says Mon
geau; and the Carnival construction crews
will be required to complete their work be
fore the Midway opens.
Mongeau is now seeking people who are 
interested in planning for Spring Carnival 
on one of twelve committees. Some of the 
committees are Eveijts, Fireworks and Ceremonies(Opening and Closing). People are 
needed to serve on the Spring Carnival 
Executive Board as chairpersons of the 
eleven remaining committees. Mongeau has 
emphasized that only those who want to 
dedicate themselves to planning this 
years Carnival should take interest in an 
executive board seat. Together with Mon
geau and Witchner, the Board will initial
ly agree on this years theme for Carnival. 
Mongeau is seeking more originality in this 
years theme compared with previous

Watergate#aLv WBMiWm crowd

---------------------------------------------------

You thought you knew everything, didn't you? But some 
things that go on at CMU just pass you by. Little tidbits of 
information never make it your way. Well, you have a right 
to know. Here's a sampling.
(1) The trustees were peeved that Jane Fonda came to 
campus. A t the trustee meeting on October 15, they com
plained that corporations wont want to donate money to 
CMU after learning that Fonda and Hayden spoke here. 
Free speech, maybe. But if it gets in the way of free money, 
it hgs no place at CMU. (So reasoned the trustees.)
(2) President Cyert has a chauffeur. His name is Vincent 
E. Young.
(3) John Dean, Watergate participant, has ties here in 
Pittsburgh. His mother went to Chatham and his dad went 
to good old Carnegie Tech as an engineer, graduating in 
1928.
(4) Twenty years ago today, (October 30, 1959) the old 
Skibo cafeteria was dosed to make room for new buildings. 
An impromptu "hell raising" party was organized by stu
dents to celebrate the dosing. Administrators finally got 
the party under control, with minimum damages.
(5) There are almost 40,000 CMU alumni. In the latest 
International Alumni Directory, Susan R. Aach, H&SS 
1973, is listed first. 38,629 alumni later, Theodore J. 
Zygmunt, Engineering 1967, is listed.
(6) The National Education Advertising Service estimates 
that 68.3% of the college students in the country own type
writers, and 56.2% own bicycles. More than 47% of college 
men own hair driers and only 8.4% of the college women 
don't.
(7) The activities fee was $15 in~1928 and is now only an 
inflation-fighting $30.
(8) There are 1000 TARTANs placed in Baker Hall every 
Tuesday morning. Every week this year, the papers have all 
been taken by 10:30 Wednesday morning.
We have lots more delicious data which we promise to 
reveal as soon as Ted Kennedy tosses his hat into the ring 
(supposedly on Thanksgiving Day). In case he is undecided 
by that time, we'U reveal our luscious list by November 21.

An easy 'A'
Editor:
I have a complaint about this 
university.
Fd like to know why all the 
engineering courses I take are so 
hard, and all the H&SS and AMS 
courses are so easy? I dont think 
I should be compared QPA-wise 
to business and humanities ma
jors. I dont do any work in my 
AMS and H&SS courses and I 
get As. But I pull all-nighters 
for my engineering courses and 
Im getting Cs.
I think my 2.5 QPA in 
ing is much better than a 3.5 QPA 
in any other major in this univer
sity. I suggest that engineers get 
one extra quality point per unit

Sizing up Food Service 
Editor:
I would like to call a significant 
problem to the attention of Food 
Service; that is, the inconvenient 
array of beverage containers that 
are available at the Tartan Grill. 
Rather than the customary 3 con
tainer sizes, (large, medium and 
small) the Grill serves four sizes. 
In fact, for some beverages five 
sizes are available.
The difficulty arises when I 
attempt to order the beverage 
of my choice. Suppose I select 
Coca-Cola. This is purchasable in 
four different container sizes 
(cups or glasses). How are they la
beled? If these were shirt sizes, 
they would be expeditiously label
ed small, medium, large, 
and extra large. Unfortunately, 
the cybernetic sales equipment be
hind the Grills counter was not 
programmed to respond to small, 
medium, large, and extra large. 
Instead, the smallest size is refered 
to as small and the largest size 
(yes you guessed it) has been as
signed the monickes large. The 
two intermediate sizes float 
somewhere in an unnameable 
nether region.
Is the size above a small a 
large small? Then the other 
would be a small large. Or per
haps they should be small med
ium and large medium. I ima
gine the series small small, 
medium small, large small 
and profoundly large small is 
unacceptable?
As you can see, this arrange
ment creates an intractable com
munication barrier between the 
customer and the sales-android. 
The customer is usually reduced 
to gesticulating spastically in the 
direction of the beverage dispen
ser while emitting incoherent gur
gling noises. On occasion, a more
inventive, or perhaps particularly 
thirsty customer will venture a 
request for  the size that is bigger 
than small, or even avoid the 
problem of labeling by bartering 
for a slide rules worth of beverage. 
(Last week I traded my fine 
cheese straightner for half a large 
small cup of Coca-Cola).
I hope Food Service will reme
dy this intolerable situation as 
soon as possible

The big bust!
Editor:
What makes drug use so special 
to me? Its an escape. I can do my 
drugs and forget about classes, my 
parents marital problems, that 
girl up the hall with lots of sex ap
pealeverything. When I take 
drugs, I just think about all sorts 
of nothing, and thats fine with 
me. If I just flunked a test; if Im 
bound to flunk another one, I say, 
Well, who gives a good goddamn, 
anyway? Im on drugs!
Now that brings me to my 
point of contention. My room
mate is on drugs. And its just un
bearable to live with him. He 
doesnt think of cleaning up the 
room, looking after his garbage, 
grades, friends, sex, anything. And
I cant stand it.
Why cant people learn to han
dle their drugs? Im going to hous
ing for a roommate switch as soon 
as Im able.
Thanks for giving me this for
um to express my opinions. By 
the way, I am now carrying an 
overload in chemistry and have a 
3.45 average in my three years at 
CMU. So dont say that drugs are 
standing in my way.

Chemicals attack lungs during cigarette smoking
Jack Mostow, a PhD student in 
Computer Science, flames 
about smoking in the following 
opinion.
Ill admit it freely: I'm a fana
tic. When someone smokes a cigar
ette in my presence, I foam at the 
mouth. Sometimes I bite. Usually 
I flame. Thats what Im going to 
do, flame about smoking.
There are two main reasons 
why I hate cigarette smoke: Its 
bad for me; its bad for you. I care 
about the first reason a lot more, 
so IM going to give a few exam
ples of why your smoking is bad 
for my health.
Sidestream smoke is the stuff 
that goes directly into the air 
from the burning end of your 
cigarette. What you inhale is
called mainstream smoke. (I get to 
breath that too, after you exhale 
it.) Sidestream smoke actually 
has HIGHER concentrations of 
bad things than mainstream 
smoke  more cadmium (damages 
lungs and causes emphysema), 
more tar and nicotine (TWICE as 
much), more of a suspected car
cinogen called 3-4 benzpyrene 
(THREE times as much), more 
carbon monoxide (FIVE times 
as much), and more ammonia 
(FIFTY times as much). (This 
and other facts cited in this 
column appear in a pamphlet 
entitled Second-Hand Smoke 
published by the American Lung 
Association.) Other known hazar
dous compounds found in cigar
ette smoke include nicotine, nitro
gen dioxide, benzene, formalde
hyde, hydrogen sulphide, and 
dozens of others. Combinations 
of these chemicals may be even 
more dangerous than the sum of 
their individual effects.
Maybe youre not convinced 
by the overwhelming statistical 
connection between tobacco 
smoke and bad news. So lets take 
a closer look at the directly test
able way in which just One of the 
chemicals in your second-hand 
smoke harms my body.
How would you like to take a 
nice deep toke on an automobile 
exhaust pipe?
If I sit next to you for an hour 
and you smoke seven cigarettes in 
that time, I get to breathe air con
taining 90 p.p.m. (parts per mil
lion) of carbon monoxide  even
in a ventilated room. Thats al
most TWICE as much as the legal 
limt in a factory, where the maxi
mum concentration cannot aver
age over 50 p.p.m. Its ten times 
the limit for outside air set by the 
Federal Air Quality Standards.
Does this affect me? You bet it 
does. The carbon monoxide level 
in my blood doubles during that 
hour. If I stay for another hour, it 
doubles again. Even after I leave, 
it takes hours for the carbon 
monoxide to leave my body. Af
ter 3 or 4 hours, half of the excess 
is still in my bloodstream.
Having this junk in my blood is 
bad for me. Carbon monoxide 
bumps oxygen molecules out of 
my red blood cells, robbing my 
body of the oxygen it needs to 
function properly. After only 30
minutes in a smoke-filled room, 
my heart beats faster and my 
blood pressure goes up. So does 
yours.Some studies indicate that 
with these levels of carbon monox
ide in the blood, people  inclu
ding drivers  cannot distinguish 
relative brightness, lose some abil
ity to judge time intervals, and 
take longer to respond to taillights. 
They also show impared perfor
mance on some psychomotor 
tests.... Animals exposed to car
bon monoxide (levels from 50 to 
100 p.pjn.) continuously for 
weeks showed damage to hear and 
brain.
Maybe some of you get your 
kicks on exhaust fumes, but I hap
pen to be very attached to my 
heart and brain. Theyre the only 
ones Ive got.
This view on the image of 
Christ " was written by Kwasi O. 
Mensah, a senior in Mechanical 
Engineering.
What color was Jesus, the 
Christ (Peace be upon him). Im 
sure many of us at one time or 
another have pondered into this 
controversial question. Actually, 
my objection is not to address this 
particular issue, but rather a much 
more serious one which deals with 
the consequences of associating 
divinity with any type of skin 
color.
Therefore, I will proceed to my 
next question: What would hap
pen to the minds of white people 
if they had been enslaved for four 
hundred years (just as the black 
man has) and told that 'white'was 
inferior and that their Savior'was 
black?'
Many of us dont even realize 
the damaging effect the caucasic 
image of Christ has had on Black 
people here in the Western hemi
sphere. To start with, the Ameri
can slave was conditioned to be
lieve that his skin color made him 
inferior; at the same instant 
white was considered holy, 
pure, and right. This caused him 
to associate divinity with white 
flesh since his savior Jesus was 
represented as such. Not only was 
this the key to the slavemasters 
psychological edge over his slaves, 
but it provided a basis for racism 
and white supremacy which still 
exists today.
It is important that we as hu
man beings fully understand this 
because it is the root to a lot of 
problems which exist between 
the races. 1 am not saying that 
today churches should replace 
their existing images with those 
of Black Christs. All this would 
do is pave the way for a Black 
supremist atmosphere. I can only 
request that all churches and 
houses of worship respond to the 
appeal of the leader of the World 
Community of Islam, Wallace D. 
Muhannad: remove all racial ef
fects of worship.
Lets not associate divinity 
with skin color, and see the 
Lord in the light of truth and 
righteousness.

graduates will have decreased to 2.821 
million: 1.787 million of these graduates, 
it has been predicted, will go on to college 
with 345,000 of these freshmen attending
private four-year colleges.

is expected to be 1000 students which 
will represent 2.9% of the freshmen 
attending private four-year colleges. In 
other words, the number of high school 
gradates as well as college freshmen is 
expected to drop, whil CMU expects 
to maintain a freshmen class of approxi
mately 1000. CMUs freshmen will con
tinue to represent a larger and larger per

Freshmen set records
by Chris Gebhardt
The admissions statistics for the CMU 
undergraduate freshman class have been 
compiled and some interesting trends 
can be observed from an analysis of the 
data. This years freshman class set new 
records in several respects.
The 1979-1980 freshman class is the 
fourth largest in total size in the past ten 
years. A total of 1,013 students enrolled 
for the fall semester. The breakdown by 
college is as follows: CIT-343, CFA-211, 
H&SS-200, MIS-195, and A&MS-64.
The most significant increase in the 
total number of freshmen enrolled in a 
single college is in H&SS: There was a
57% increase from 1978.
The number of applications received 
by CMU Admissions remained fairly 
constant over the last two years, except 
in H&SS where the number of appicants 
increased by approximately 54%.
Another interesting statistical aspect of 
the size of the freshman class is the U.S. 
regions from which they come: Pennsylvania-53%, Ohio, Washington D.C., 
Maryland and Virginia-13%, New York10%, New Jersey-7%; New England-9%, 
Southeast-4% and 4% from other states 
and countries.
Data on college freshmen throughout 
the United States has shown a definite 
developing trend. The national trends 
seem to coincide with the trends at CMU. 
In 1961, the year of birth for this years 
freshmen, there were 4.317 million births 
in the United States. This was the second 
highest year for births in the United
States since 1952, with 1957 having the 
greatest number of births.
Of the people born in 1961, there were 
3.127 million high school graduates. Of 
these graduates, 1.954 million went on to 
continue their education: 793,000 are
attending public four-year colleges, 385,00 
are attending private four-year colleges, 
725,000 are attending public two-year 
colleges, and 51,000 are attending private 
two-year colleges. Of these college fresh
men, 1,013 are attending CMU.
CMU freshmen represent 2.63% of the 
freshmen attending private four-year col
leges in the United States.
The freshmen class of 1983 will be a 
peak year for both high school graduates 
and number of students entering college. 
By 1983, the graduation date for this

percent of British lawmakers and civil 
servants.
Consumer price index update
The CPI rose 1.1 percent in September. 
As in past months, energy and housing 
costs were primary causes for the in
crease. On a new front, food prices went 
up 0.9 percent, led by a 2.7 percent in
crease in the prices of fruits and vegetables.
The Consumer Price Index covers about 
80 percent of the U.S. population. The 
latest figures indicate that $100 worth of 
goods and services bought in 1967 would 
now cost $223.40.
U.S. sensors detect possible atomic explo
sion near South Africa
U.S. Government officials announced 
last week that U.S. satellite records showed 
evidence of a recent, low-yield nuclear 
explosion in the region between South 
Africa and Antarctica. The United States 
has been aware of South Africas nuclear 
intentions since mid-1977 and South
Africa no longer denies its interest in join
ing the so-called nuclear club. U.S. offi
cials will not make a formal accusation 
until they have more conclusive evidence.
Dayan resigns over policy dispute
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan 
resigned his post last week because of 
substantive differences with Prime Min
ister Begin on the form of Palestinian 
self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Dayan was a moderating force in the 
Begin government. He opposed the erec
tion of Jewish settlements on unimproved 
Arab lands and he met several times with 
Palestinian leftists (not members of PLO) 
in hopes of creating a climate for dialogue.
Shah receiving cancer tests in New York
The deposed Shah of Iran has been 
admitted on humanitarian grounds to a 
New York hospital for tests. He is af
flicted a malignant tumor and other 
complications. The shah is here on an 
open-ended business visa. His official 
residence remains in Mexico. The Carter 
administration emphasized that the United 
States cooperative policies toward the 
Khomeini regime remain in effect.
Kennedy now a legal candidate
Sen. Edward Kennedy ended the 
suspense last week and became a legal 
candidate for president by accepting more 
than $75,000 in campaign contributions.
Carter approves trade benefits for China
President Carter opened the way for 
improved Chinese-American trade relations 
last week by approving most-lavorednation status for mainland China. Mostfavored-nations have a reduced-tariff rela
tionship with the U.S. The Soviet Union 
is in line for similar tariff reductions if 
Moscow relaxes the restrictions on emigra
tion, thereby complying with official 
U.S. policy on trading with communist 
nations.
Union leader named to Chrysler Board of 
Directors
Last week, Douglas A. Eraser, president 
of the United Auto Workers, was invited 
to serve' on the board at Chrysler Corp. 
This unprecedented event was only part 
of a tentative agreement between the UAW 
and Chrysler that will save the No. 3 auto 
maker about $203 million over the next 
two years. Government assistance is still 
necessary, however, if Chrysler is to 
regain fiscal stability.
U.S. plans to rebuild nuclear arsenal in 
western Europe
The NATO nations will vote in De
cember on a proposed U.S. plan to with
draw 1000 obsolete nuclear weapons 
and replace them with cruise missiles 
and other weapons that can reach targets 
within the Soviet Union. The new missiles, 
if deployed, would counterbalance the 
Soviet force of SS-20 missiles that are 
aimed at Europe.
Undergrad EE prof
by Beth Arden
You have to develop your own style, 
is how Rich Arnold sums up his first two 
months of teaching. Arnold, a senior elec
trical engineering student with grade aver
age 3.91, is teaching two recitations of a 
junior-level EE course, Field Analysis.
So far, there havent been many prob
lems, he says. He has little difficulty sep
arating his instructor and student roles and 
therefore has not had a discipline problem. 
The student feedback has also been favor
able. Its funnyI can read the students 
faces like books, Arnold commented. I 
can usually tell when someone understands 
what Im doing.
Arnold has the job because the schedul
ed professor could not teach the course. 
Dr. Hoburg [the course chairman] called 
me two weeks before the beginning of 
school to ask me if I were interested in the 
joband I jumped at the opportunity, he 
recalled. Right now, he is being paid with 
work-study money. When that runs out, he 
will be getting paid by the department.
Arnold feels he is working for the best 
department in CIT, stating that the profes
sors were well-qualified and concerned 
about their students.
In the lines of teaching, Arnold has had 
no special training, but feels he is qualified 
to teach this course because of his familiar
ity with the subject matter and because of 
his physics tutoring background.
In all, he stated he was glad for the 
chance at the experience. Teaching is interesting...but its a lot more work than I 
realized, he concluded. I enjoy it 
though.

Cyert: 'We must take a hard look at educational issues'
continued from page 1
future. Despite these extra costs, Cyert ad
ded that CMU had had another year in the 
black, with a recorded $83,000 surplus.
President Cyert informed trustees that 
Daniel Berg, Dean of MIS, has formed an 
energy committee to look at the potential 
energy saving ideas that could be implem
ented on campus. He stressed that he anti
cipates larger expenditures on utilities in 
the future, and that the committee will be 
useful in exploring ideas that will help cut 
these costs.
CMU generated enough income to sup
port operations in 1979 without using the 
University endowment which currently has 
a market value of $115 million. We dont 
want to use unrestricted funds on oper
ations, said Cyert. He also stated that he 
is investigating a less traditional invest
ment policy in order to develop a more 
diversified portfolio.
The next topic on the agenda was the 
state of the university. In reference to an 
article in Change Magazine (see Views 
in the September 18 issue of the TAR
TAN), which ranked CMU in the top 20 of 
American colleges and universities on the 
quality of incoming students, Cyert said 
that CMUs high ranking is attributable to 
the fact that ...we increased the number 
of students and improved the quality at the 
same time.
With a steady state value of 3500 
students, the university has lowered its at
trition rate from 12% to 7% over the last 
four years. Cyert expressed his wish that 
CMU would attract more graduate students 
and less undergraduate students in near fu
ture. -i
In keeping with his strategies for excel
lence theme, Cyert said, Were putting 
the university on a basis where we will be 
getting more qualified faculty including 
plans to hire the best young faculty from 
good universities. According to Cyert, the 
the university must take a hard look at 
educational issues [and] ...examine the 
problems and tensions between the profes
sional education versus the general educa
tion. He added that at CMU we dont 
teach a course [in] ethics in the training
of individuals, but that ethics should be a 
part of the general learning experience at 
this university.
Commenting on new faculty and ap
pointments, Cyert stated that he is deligh
ted with how [Louis Sauer] is taking hold 
of the architecture department, saying 
that in three to five years, I think we will 
have a department with excellent and un
ique characteristics.  He also believes 
William Sirignano, head of Mechanical En
gineering, will revitalize that depart
ment, and Dwight Sangry, newly-appointed 
head of Civil Engineering, who will assume 
his position in December, will be a positive 
erinforcement for the civil engineering de
partment.
Cyert reported that Jane Fondas lec
ture on October 8 was without incident, 
and that the Truth Squad which follow
ed the Fonda-Hayden lecture did not draw 
as large an audience as the preceding lec
ture did. He said that it is important to 
get both sides discussed at the same time 
...[and] we will continue to get controver
sial speakers. One trustee commented that
'Corporate governance' discussed here
continued from page 1
organization responsive to needs of the 
people. He said a strong business ethic is 
vital to successful corporation. Shapiro 
stresses, The task now is not to bring 
drastic change to the corporate interior, 
turning business units into instruments of 
the national government, but to'make 
those shifts that will best demonstrate 
that the large corporation is in the hands 
of the people.
Williams spoke about .the contradictons 
that an one hand interest is stressed with 
greater government dictated control over
what our large corporations do, and on 
the other hand the strong current of 
Public sentiment for less government 
involvement in all facets of private acti
vity. He stated the private sector must 
take the initiative in structuring effec
tive mechanisms of corporate accounta
bility; all executives must be account
able. When the public sees a corporate 
accountability gap they pressure the go
vernment to step in. To Williams, the 
answer is to be found in the corporate 
boardroom. He said the board should 
project objective advice and not let 
personalities, friendships or pocketbooks
get in the way. Each board is a mini
society, said Williams, no one on the 
board should bf afraid to challenge chief 
executives. Membership should be regu
lated giving insiders and outsiders a voice, 
and executives should work together with 
mangement. He also urges private sec
tors to get stronger (i.e. Business Round 
Table). Williams stated, I believe that the 
philosophies of full disclosure and of fair 
and open corporate suffrage have helped 
to preserve public confidence in business. 
The two speches lasted for 90 minutes 
and were followed by a question and 
answer session.
it was a waste of money for students to 
hear Jane Fonda, and that the money 
could be better spent.
The meeting was turned over to Dean 
Berg at this point. At the request of Dr. 
Cyert, Berg outlined the educational issues 
that he believed were relevant for the univ
ersity and trustees to consider.
First, he cited education for the sci
ence uncergraduate and discussed the fol
lowing questions: What kind of new op
tions and programs should be offered?; 
How much non-science should there be in 
the science curriculum?; and Are we teach
ing students to be eternal students?
Berg then brought up the issue of grad
uate education. Maintaining that there is 
a decline in the quality of graduate stu
dents [in science areas primarily because 
of] economics and job market decline. He 
also pointed out that in MIS there is a 25% 
graduate enrollment of students who are 
not US citizens; Berg believes this is too 
high a percentage.
The science college funding has increas
ed in the last five years partly due to the

ETS protests new law
by Dave Radack
The recently passed Truth in Testing 
law will probably force the cancellation of 
three quarters of the standardized college 
and graduate school admission tests given 
in New York State, according to the New 
York Times.
Sponsors and publishers of many of the 
tests said that it would be impossible to 
comply with the law which requires them 
to publish test questions within 30 days of 
reporting scores. '
The legislation was mainly aimed at re
moving the secrecy that surrounds many 
"standardized tests. Previously, examinees 
were not allowed to see their test questions 
and/or answer sheets once the test was 
completed.
This doesnt mean, however, that uni
versities in New York State will not require 
standardized tests for admission to their 
respective schools. The tests will have to be
taken elsewhere, perhaps in neighboring 
states. Nevertheless, testing organizations 
such as the Educational Testing Service will 
continue to administer the high volume 
tests such as the SAT, LSAT, and GMAT 
but examinees will pay a small surcharge to 
defray the extra cost of compliance.
Sponsors of the new Medical College 
Admission Test (MCAT) argue that, due to 
the specialized nature of their test, it 
would be impossible to continue its use in 
New York; however, no formal announce
ment has been made.
This law has the potential to effect the 
validity of all testing nationally. Standard
ized testing is at best an inexact science, 
and there are many critics who call for the 
abandonment of all such tests. 
They argue that a single test taken on one 
day (particularly aptitude tests such as the 
SAT, LSAT, GMAT) is not a good indi
cator of success in future academic en
deavors.
Student Dorm Council Space
by Ken Kulak
Between TARTAN issues, the Student 
Dormitory Council held two meetings, one 
on October 17 and another on October 24. 
Major highlights of the two meetings were:
-The announcement of a housing survey 
of dormitory lounge usage, which will 
result in an evaluation and possible upgrad
ing of lounge conditions;
-The news that a letter concerning the 
Centrex problems of those students living 
in rooms with unpaid bills will be released 
in one or two weeks;
-The difficulty with dormitory garbage 
pickup has been investigated, and although 
a contractual agreement with the Univer
sitys refuse disposal service has been made, 
nothing can be done about the 24-hour 
city pickup at Roselawn and also at the
corner of Morewood and Forbes.
SDC also appropriated $100 for dark
room supplies, and an undetermined 
amount for a darkroom air conditioner. Up 
to $200 was allocated for new pool cues 
and miscellaneous gaming equipment. Dan 
Nichols was appointed to the SDC Cabinet 
as an advisor.
President Jim Balsom announced that 
SDC will sponsor a forum on the Margaret 
Morrison Apartments at 5:00 PM in the 
apartment courtyard. Speaking at the 
forum will Oscar Mayer and Yvonne 
McCredie (Auxiliary Services), Bob Anderegg (Security), Gerry Dalton (Housing), 
and Cushing Phillips (Physical Plant).
SDC will hold its next meeting tomor
row night at 7:00 PM in the Wherrett 
Room, Skibo.
New RSAF explained
The Residents Supplementary Activi
ties Fund (RSAF) was set up so that dorm 
residents could pool their resources when 
planning activities. This money can be 
used for any activity the residents want 
to plan; picnics, parties, trips, anything. 
SDC gets this money from the dorm ac
tivities fee you paid at the beginning of 
the year.
How much can you get? This is deter
mined by the number of people in your 
SDC constituency multiplied by the 
dollar-per-person amount available per 
semester (your SDC rep. can tell you what 
that is). For example, if your consti
tuency has 50 people in it, and the 
dollar-per-person amount is $2, then the 
amount your constituency can use is 
(up to) $100 per semester. If you dont 
use all of it in the fall semester, the left
over amount is added to - your fund for 
the spring semester, so plan your use ac
cordingly.
How do you go about getting RSAF 
funds?
If you have an idea for an activity, 
and you want to use RSAF funds for 
it, go to your RA and have him/her 
call a floor meeting (or call your own 
meeting if you want). Make sure your 
SDC representative is there.
Discuss the activity with your 
floor or constituency. Find out from 
your SDC rep how much money is available, and decide how much you 
want to use. Take a vote on whether 
or not you want to have the activity. 
The SDC rep should record the vote.
Tell the SDC rep the date, time, 
place, and description of the activity, 
and how much RSAF money you are 
requesting.
NOTE: If you want to get the money
before the event, which you probably do,
then make sure all this is done at least 
five class days befor the event. That way 
your rep can call the SDC treasurer and get 
the ball rolling on the paperwork side 
Your SDC rep will pass out vote 
vouchers to the constituency so that 
SDC can check the vote. You need a 
majority of 75% of the constituency 
to get funds.
Your SDC rep will take the request 
and vouchers to the SDC Vice Presi
dent for approval. If it is approved, 
the treasurer will release the funds to 
the rep.
You must get receipts for any RSAF 
money spent. The SDC rep must account 
for all funds received, so you must give 
him/her all receipts and/or leftover funds.

Cyert to chair commission
This committee is not just a window

Richard Thornburgh in response to a 
question about his newly created Tax 
Reform Commission. He has appointed 
CMU President Richard M. Cyert as chair
man of the 17-member commission.
Cyert and his commission, which
includes four other Pittsburghers, are
charged with seeking reforms assuring
that no Pennsylvanian pays more than his 
or her fair share of our tax burden in the 
years ahead.
Thornburgh has instructed the commit
tee that they must submit a report of their 
findings by January 15, 1981. The only 
stipulation he has given the commission is 
that their proposals and recommendations 
cannot include a tax increase.
When asked if the commission would 
tend to heavily favor business because of 
its composition, Thornburgh replied that 
he felt they would be both thorough and 
objective.

Louis Sauer, the new head of the Department of Architecture.
by Stuart I. Seidman
The dust has settled, the air has cleared, 
and Louis Sauer has emerged as the new 
head of the Department of Architecture. 
Appointed last* spring in the midst of a 
heated controversy between faculty, stu
dents, and administration, Sauer has 
taken full control of the department. 
He has brought many new faculty members 
and has begun plotting out a strategy 
to increase the amount of research that 
the department conducts.
Sauer, age 50, has had a private arch
itectural practice in Philadelphia for almost 
two decades. He has been a guest lecturer 
at 26 Universities and has taught at six. 
His most recent academic position was as 
an Adjunct Professor at the University of 
Pennsylvania. With all of this professional 
success, Sauer chose to close his office and 
accept the position of Department Head at 
CMU.
Sauer first explained that while he has 
closed his Philadelphia office, he is not disMore and more 
students see more 
and more roles for 
themselves than the 
conventional role."
continuing his private practice. He elab
orated on this explaining that he will be 
entering into joint ventures with other 
firms as necessary. I dont want to prac
tice in Pittsburgh, he emphasized, men
tioning that he has been offered work in 
this city since accepting the headship here. 
Sauer wants to be looked upon as a col
league, not an invader, by the Pittsburgh 
architectural community while he builds a 
dialogue with the local profession. He 
explained that at sometime in the future he 
will consider local commissions, but in the 
meantime he wants to get to know Pitts
burgh better and let Pittsburgh get to 
know him.
On why he decided to take on the 
position of the head of the department 
Sauer had no single reason. All the goals I 
wanted, I accomplished, was his simple 
explanation,, but he attempted to relate 
his deeper feelings. He talked about how he 
experienced all he could in private practice 
and that by returning to an academic 
environment he hoped to be able to 
explore aspects of architecture that he 
could not in the private sector.__________
"All the goals I 
wanted, I 
Accomplished."
Whdi lie hopes to aclueve m academia 
relates toward his feelings about the 
profession. The profession of architec
ture has acted as a wealthy family. I percieve it as impoverished but having a 
jewel. It you are wealthy, you think 
differently than if you are impoverished, 
Sauer has said. In other words, even though 
architects might design excellent solutions
to a building problem, they have no guar
antee that the project will be built the way 
it was designed. Sauer feels that architects 
should gain more control over the building 
process to insure that things like that do 
not happen: To this end he would like 
to investigate the relationships in designbuild firms and architecture-development 
companies.
This all ties into the major problem of 
architecture students nationwide; finding 
jobs upon graduation. Sauer feels that the 
profession is expanding at a reasonable 
rate, but with as many architecture stu
dents as practicing architects in this coun
try there is no way for all graduates to 
find jobs in traditional firms.
There is a much bigger demand (for 
architects) than perceived, he explained, 
mentioning that in many states engineers 
and contractors are attempting to change 
the registration rules that require a degree 
from an accredited institution or a very 
long apprenticeship under an architect. 
If society did not feel that the architect 
was important, there would not be this 
push to allow more people to become 
registered architects.
Sauer is also enthused about how 
graduates have created jobs for themselves. 
More and more students see more and 
more roles for themselves than the con
ventional role. Along with the many 
graduates that are working in the new 
and rehabilitated housing markets he sees 
architects working with government to 
formulate public policy and in techno
logical roles related to building systems.
This all comes together in what Sauer 
sees as the future of architecture at CMU. 
He envisions architecture as the intellec
tual basis of design and an institution for 
societys change, but he does not feel 
that architecture or architects can be 
easily defined. What is the practicng 
architect? is the theme to which the 
department has two primary responsibi
lities: to teach and to practice, allowing 
both the student and the teacher to acquire 
knowledge. It is Sauers belief that the 
term practice means different theings 
to different people, and he hopes to be 
able to offer more options to the under
graduate student in order to let him 
pursue intellectual study in the facet of 
architecture that most interests him.
"There is a much 
bigger demand 
(for architects) 
architects) 
than perceived."
In order to determine where new pro
grams might be needed he is currently 
reviewing the present set-up of the depart
ment. Sauer is curious about the lack of 
coordination between the different cours
es, such as Design Studio and Design 
Technology. He is also having Eleanor 
Weinel prepare an evalution of the current 
CEIS course.
The largest change this year has been in 
the Design Studio, with the appointment 
of nine new faculty members. New at CMU 
this your are some of the most important 
names in American architecture and urban 
design today. From Pittsburghs own 
Raymond Gindroz to the Essex, Connecti
cut firm of Charles Moore, Sauer has 
assembled one of the best design faculties 
to teach at Carnegie-Mellon in years. 
While some of the new faculty members 
are only here for the fall, Jerzey Sultan will 
be teaching a senior studio in the spring.
and Sauer is currently negotiating with 
Robert Venturi.
In just four months Louis Sauer has 
taken a department divided and given it a 
definite course for the future. He is en
thused by all of the architectural discussion 
in Pittsburgh brought out by the Renais
sance II and the Johnson design for the 
PPG Tower. Feeling that the level of 
architectural discussion in Pittsburgh is 
higher than most American cities at this 
time, Sauer thinks that the department 
should play a major role in the shaping of

Ever since Ive been teaching, Ive hated 
grading. When semesters end rolls around, 
I have Roman Colosseum visions of sending 
my students off to be gored by the Regis
trars pen. A messy business at best.
All teachers were students once, and I 
dont know about others, but when I was a 
student,grading time wasnt exactly jubila
tion time at the old corral. I did pretty 
well, but there always seemed to be an un
welcome surprise or a grade you knew about, but didnt much want to see in print.
Ive suspected it was old report cards 
that made my stomach flip every time, as a 
teacher, I got those grading cards from the 
registrar. And it made me think that grades 
were maybe just bad medicine that a 
teacher had to get used to doling out. Then 
again, Ive long maintained a deep suspi
cion of bad medicine.
The Hidden Assumptions of Grading
To my delight and amazement, Ive re
cently seen more clearly why the grading 
system really is a huge factory of rancid 
medicine, and why its no surprise that it 
feels awful to students and teachers alike. 
Underlying the grading system are (at 
least) three assumptions. Each one is fun
damentally wrong, and each in some way 
destroys bur understanding of what real 
learning is, and what a sensible educational 
system could be like.
OK, what are these charming assump
tions?
1. Youve got to have grades to moti
vate students or they wouldn't learn any
thing at all.
2. Some students are just inherently
Renaissance II. The fall and spring lecture 
series (Wednesday evenings and open to the 
public) have been organized around the 
theme Image and Place and are featuring 
architects and urban designers from all over 
North America. He would like to see more 
public exhibitions of student work to 
show Pittsburgh what it could look like 
and to discourage satisficing. According to 
Sauer, the CMU Department of Architec
ture, being situated in one of Americas 
major cities, must and will be heard.
smarter than others, and grades sort out 
the smarter students.
3. It is appropriate for some large ma
jority of students in a course (typically 60- 
90%) to complete the course without mas
tering the material.
Every one of these assumptions deserves 
to be challenged and thoroughly thrashed. 
So lets plunge right in.
Learning is FUN!
First of all, learning is inherently fun 
for everyone, though the educational 
system has done its best to make such an 
idea laughable.
Probably the toughest thing we ever 
learned to do was walk and talk. Yet, every 
one of us (who was physically capable) 
learned how, energetically and enthusias
tically. We learned to walk, though we fell 
down a zillion times, and we learned to 
talk, even though hardly anyone under
stood us at first, and for a long time, we 
couldnt make the sounds we wanted. But 
we kept trying, and shrieked and clapped 
and laughed and cried with every success 
and failure along the way. Now shrieking, 
clapping, and laughing, and crying were 
hardly part of the acceptable behaviors in 
our early classroom experiences. Keep 
that is mind as we think about how learn
ings thrill has gone away.
I imagine that if Walking & Talking 
00-111 were part of the standard fresh
man curriculum in the standard university 
with the standard grading system we would 
find that 60-90% of sophomores would 
babble or trip over their own feet. And of 
course we would treat that as completely 
normal and fitting in with the standard 
curve.
Our experience in classrooms may have 
led us to forget that learning ALWAYS 
used to be fun. And no matter how bad

Easy creative costumes
by Valerie Brandt
Well, tomorrow is Halloween, and such 
things have a way of sneaking up on you, 
so many of you who plan on going trick 
or treating in and around the Oakland 
area or have parties to go to, and are 
cursing yourselves for leaving your clown 
suit or vampire fangs at home, I have com
piled the following list of suggestions for 
easy to make costumes from materials 
easily obtained around campus:
1)Attach inflated purple balloons to 
various parts of your body, wear a leaf on 
your head, and go as a bunch of Concord 
grapes.
2)Wear a flowered shirt and go as 
Morewood Gardens.
3)Ask a lot of questions and go as a 
midterm.
4)Steal pictures of Freshmen and go as 
the H&SS lounge.
5)Steal lots of change and go as a vend
ing machine.
6)Paint a black stripe down your back 
and go as a Vali-Dine Card (or an inver
ted skunk)
7)Wear a shirt with lots of buttons and 
go as the Mellon Banking Machine.
8)^ut on clothes soaked in alcohol, light 
a match, and go as Dantes Inferno.
9)Grab four friends and go as a fifth.
10)Steal all your friends keys, rent a 
carriage and go as a typewriter.
1 l)Cut two holes in a sheet, put it over 
your head, carry paper and a pencil and go 
as a ghostwriter.
12)A SPECIAL ONE IN CASE OF 
SNOW ON HALLOWEEN: Wear several 
coats, and go as the fence.
13)ONE THATS SURE TO SCARE 
THE HELL OUT OF SOMEBODY: Just be 
yourself...
Haunted House spooksguests
by Carolyn Toth
A few weeks ago, the Greater Pittsburgh 
Chapter of the March of Dimes opened 
their Haunted House. Now in its sixth year, 
this annual event treats thousands of Pitts
burghers to the wonderful horrors of Hallo
ween.
This project has proven to be one of the 
organizations biggest money raisers. Last 
year the Haunted House brought the March 
of Dimes close ta $70,000. All of the pro
ceeds go to the support of the research 
programs, public health education, and 
medical service for the prevention of birth 
defects.
This years Haunted House is guaranteed 
to spook the most stoic visitor. There are 
15 ghoulish rooms in the house. The 
Haunted Forest, The Gauntlet Room, and 
an encore of last years Tunnel of Terror 
highlight your passage. If you scoff at the 
idea of a room being frightening enough to 
startle you, dont rest too easily. Aside 
from the rooms, you may fall prey to a 
number of Fiendish werewolves and other 
monsters that lurk around every corner.
The Haunted House did not materialize 
on its own. Different organizations and/or 
schools donated their time and effort to
designing and decorating one or more 
rooms of the house. All materials needed 
are provided by the March of Dimes. Some 
of the participants in this years house 
include Robert Morris College, The Ivy 
School, Allegheny and Boyce campuses of 
Allegheny County Community College, 
Duquesne University (Sigma Delta Chi) and * 
Point Park College.
CMU participated in this activity for 
many years but recently interest here has 
decreased.
Three CMU students, however, managed 
to put together one room this year. They 
emphasized that Its a lot of fun, not to 
mention the worthwhile cause of which 
you become a part.
The Haunted House is located on the 
second level of the Allegheny Center Mall 
(2nd level, above Zayres Department *
Store). It is open through Halloween night, 
on weekdays from 6 to 10 PM, and on 
weekends from 2 to 10 PM. There is a one 
hour free parking in the malls under
ground garage. The donation for adultsr13 
and up, is $2 and SI for children. Parents 
with pre-school children are urged to use 
discretion.
Grappling with grading
continued from page 11
our learning experiences have been (and we 
pro'bably each have a real horror story or 
two), that potential for enthusiastic learn
ing is really still there. The implication for 
teachers is that we can assume that our 
classes provide an opportunity for our stu
dents to have a hell of a good time learn
ing.
Admittedly, thats a little tough to keep 
in mind each time I walk into class. This is 
partly because I think that the classroom 
as it normally operates is far from an ideal 
learning environment. And yet, classrooms 
can, and do work effectively. Partly its be
cause I teach a required course. And yet, I 
think that computer programming is a real
ly important skill, that it makes sense that 
its required for lots of majors, and that 
everyone taking it can enjoy it.
Heres what it boils down to: My atti
tude as a teacher is going to determine 
whether my class is a good one. I do 
assume that what Im teaching is impor
tant, and that everybody in my class is as 
peachy keen enthusiastic about learning as
I am about teaching. And I find that when 
Im well prepared, energetic and receptive 
in class, so are my students.
Most importantly, this attitude keeps 
me reminded that when my students look 
impatient or bored, or just generally like 
theyve succumbed to an advanced case of 
the fuzzies, that I can do something about 
it. I can change my speed, or my presenta
tion of material or the way I divide up time 
in class. And I can keep experimenting un
til I find out what it is that makes the class 
work.

John Dean's career story
by Robert Harris
From July 27. 1970, until lie was fired 
by President Nixon April 30. 1973, John 
Wesley Dean 111 was the scholarly Chief 
Counsel to the President. The bespectacled 
face is as tanned, young looking, and owl
ish today as the esquire-type face that at
tracted the image-conscious Nixon Admin
istration in 1970.
There is nothing in Deans early back
ground that would suggest that Dean 
would be disloyal to President Richard Ni
xon. Deans background, his testimony 
before the Ervin Committee, and Richard 
Nixons actions toward John Dean testify 
to the opinion that John Wesley Dean 111 
was as loyal to Richard M. Nixon as can be 
humanly expected.
Dean was born in Akron. Ohio, October 
14, 1938. His father, John Dean, Jr., 
moved his family to several Midwestern 
cities while he was ascending through 
the tiers of the Firestone Tire and Rubber 
Company. Dean and his sister, Anne, were 
not adversely affected by the early changes 
of address.
"Whatever helped the team 
was what he wanted to do.'
Deans educauonai .diCwi at Staunton 
Military Academy in Virginia showed Dean 
as an individual who was willing to make 
his own goals subserviant to the goal of a 
group. His swimming coach, Col. Ed 
recalled for Time (June 25, 1973), What
ever helped the team was what he wanted 
to do. If I had to take John out of one 
event in which he really excelled and put 
him in another where he didnt, hed do it 
and never complain.
Dean graduated from Staunton and en
tered Colgate University as an English 
major in 1957. He scrapped the idea of 
joining the Episcopalian ministry. He trans
ferred from Colgate to Ohio College of 
Wooster in 1959 where he graduated in 
1961. From Wooster he went to American 
University Graduate School of Government 
where he graduated with a degree in public 
administration in 1962. His next step was 
to obtain a law degree from Geoigetown in 
1965. Dean was Finally ready to take on 
the world____________________________
"His rapid success can be 
attributed to his compelling 
ambition."
Veiy shuitly attci obtaining Ins law 
degree he went to work for a Washington 
law firm. Six months later he was fired for 
conflict of interest. Dean took on the 
world too fast. He was supposed to be pre
paring a clients application for a new tele
vision slat ion. but he was caught preparing 
a rival application for a rival news station - 
his own.
Despite his being fired. Dean was 
promptly hired by Ohio Representative 
William McCulloch as Chief Minority 
Counsel for the House Judiciary Com
mittee from 196b to I9(>7. Dean's next 
step up the ladder was his assignment as 
Associate, Director of the National Com
mission on Reform of Federal Criminal 
Laws from l%7 and 1969. A bi promo
tion was his assignment as Associate Depu
ty Attorney General in the Department of 
Justice from 1969 to 1970. His appoint
ment to the /oo tip the street was Coun
sel to the President from 1970 to 1973.
It is ironic that then Attorney General 
Mitchell suggested that he would be better 
off staying in the Department of Justice. 
Mitchell told Dean that the White House 
was not a healthy place.
Deans appointment to the White House 
can be attributed to his fierce loyalty to 
Nixon while Dean was in the Department 
of Justice. His rapid success can be attribu
ted to his compelling ambition, and cer
tainly his first marriage to Karla Hennings, 
the bearer of Dean's son, John IV, and the 
daughter of the late Senator Thomas C. 
Henning of Missouri, didnt hurt his chan
ces either. Dean is presently married to 
Maureen Kane, who was often seen in 
the Ervin Committee hearings sitting be
hind Dean on his right during his testi
mony.
Dean had several detractors that accused 
Dean of being a moth that knew how to 
find the light. He countered his detrac
tors accusation when answering Editor 
Jean Pellegrinis question during an inter
view with the TARTAN and WRCT last 
Tuesday: To what does he attribute his 
success? Dean said:
Theres always an element of luck of 
being the right person at the right time 
with the right credentials. Yes, I did have 
things I employed. I was not what youd 
call a sychophant. I was not an apple - 
polisher.Rather...my approach was to quietly 
work in the background until someone 
would say, hey! whos doing all that good 
work and get recognized on that basis 
where they sought you out.
When a superior gave me an assignment 
they didnt have to give it to me twice. I 
took responsibility for the things I did. 1 
would try to anticipate a boss need before 
he even knew he had the need. I didnt 
seek all my jobs and the word spreads 
after awhile.
Deans job as Counsel to the President 
required that he draft all Executive orders 
and prepare legal opinions for the President 
on many matters. Dean worked on the 
legality of expanding Executive priviledge 
and Nixons decisions to impound funds
"I took responsibility for 
the things I did."
voted by Congress. Dean helped arrange 
Nixons commutation of jail sentences 
being served by Teamster Boss, Jimmy 
Hoffa, and Mafia Capo, Angelo Decarlo. 
Deans job did not allow' Dean to make 
policy, he was a conduit for policy.
Being an unquestioning conduit is
what got Dean in trouble. Being a question
ing conduit is what got Dean out of trou
ble.
Dean decided to testify and cooperate 
with the Ervin Committee and the special 
prosecutors in entirety. He knew he had 
obstructed justice, he was in trouble, and 
that he was being set up to take the blame 
for the entire Watergate mess.
Having served his four months in jail for 
obstruction of justice, because he handled 
some of the silencing payoffs to the origi
nal Watergate wiretappers, and his coaching 
of Jeb Magruders perjury to the Grand 
Jury investigation. Dean is now touring the 
country on a lecture tour entitled Blind 
Ambition after his book of similar title.

Spotlight on .. . spirit
by Paul Karmin
Spirit is a campus organization which 
helps to serve the interests of the CMU 
black community. In general, their goals 
are to provide cultural and educational 
events, as well as promote the employment 
of black faculty and administrators. We are 
here to assist in making it easier for blacks 
to successfully adapt to a basically allwhite campus, said James Patterson, 
Coordinator of Spirit.
Spirit has approximately 130 dues-paying 
members and is governed by a dual system 
of committees. There is the executive com
mittee, a secretary and treasurer. In there is 
a finance programming committee that is 
responsible for raising and disbursing funds.
So far this year, Spirit has an impressive 
schedule of events. For example, on October 
31 at 7:30 PM in Skibo Rm 16, Pennsylvania 
State representative Joseph Rhodes will 
speak on various issues facing America 
today. Also, on November 15, the Sounds 
of Togetherness jazz quintet will be fea
tured in the Wherrett Room at 9 PM. Admis
sion is free and anyone is invited to attend 
these events. Future plans include a possible 
Spring lecture on the Islamic Faith by 
Wallace Deen Myhammed, leader of The 
World Community of Islam in the West.
All events are featuring black artists or 
speakers but are equally important to white 
students because they get to see a side of 
black people they wouldnt normally see,
PCayg>umdMini-mystery
i.e. blacks as artists and intellectuals, instead 
of the stereotypical Sanford and Son 
portrayed on TV, Patterson explained. 
The ultimate goal of Spirit is to increase the 
sense of community on campus.
Spirits immediate plans to increase their 
activities in campus affairs and concentrate 
on the promotion of black faculty members 
as well as encourage more minority students 
to attend graduate schools.
Anyone interested in Spirit is invited to 
attend the biweekly meetings held Monday 
at 6:30 PM in Skibo Room 45 or call Jim 
Patterson at 578-4415. The next meeting 
is scheduled for October 29.

The Inspector twisted her mouth pen
sively, surveying the scene of the crime. 
The room, a small annex to a publishers 
mansion, had been broken into from the 
outside. A large display case in the center 
of the room had been dismantled  the 
huge, flawless rose-colored diamond it 
once housed gone.
Police filled her in on the only clues 
found at the scene: large footprints on the 
ground below the broken window and a 
small diamond-tipped cutting tool found 
near the display case.
Seeing nothing of galactic import her
self, Inspector Denar headed for the draw
ing room where Captain Dougsop had as
sembled the suspects: the groundskeeper, 
Steiny Eplynn; the maid, Meg Tomalis; and 
the butler, Steve Skaren.
Just one moment, Inspector. Whats 
going on here? Skaren snapped as Denar 
entered the room. Why are we being de
tained?
Theres been a robbery from your em
ployers collection room, she explained. 
Since all of you work here, youre all sus
pects.
I see, he answered, reseating himself.
Dougsop began the questioning. Where 
were you this evening, Skaren?
Well, since this is my night off, I ate 
dinner here with the other servants, then 
went out at about 7 oclock to go play 
poker with some of my old army buddies. I 
just returned about 10 minutes ago. The 
Captain here then proceeded to round me 
up.
What about you, Tomalis?
Well, I had a lot of sewing and men
ding to do, so after dinner, I returned to 
my room upstairs. I worked straight 
through the evening until the Captain came 
and knocked on my door to call me down 
here. So I guess I must have been in my 
room when the diamond was stolen, she
answered. She looked at Dougsop plea
dingly. But I didnt hear anyone break in. 
honestly! If only I had, maybe I could have 
stopped them... she broke down, sobbing. 
Eplynn comforted her.
And how about you, Eplynn?
Since I do my work during the day
light hours, I always have the evenings 
off. Tonight I entertained guests at my cot
tage by the main gate. I must have been 
there when the intruder broke in, but I 
didnt hear anything, either. Its a shame, 
someone should have been able to stop 
them.
The Captain looked to the Inspector, 
who was grinning like a Cheshire Cat. I 
want to thank you all, she said warmly, 
for solving this robbery so quickly.
She walked over to the suspect that 
committed the crime and exclaimed, Lets 
go downtown so you can make your con
fession!

New testing laws considered
(CPS)-Its going to be harder to take 
college entrance exams in New York soon, 
and if Congress approves a couple of bills it 
considered in committee this past week, it 
might be harder to take those tests every
where else in the country, too.
They are truth-in-testing bills, which 
require that the companies that create and 
administer standardized tests file test ques
tions and answers with state education 
commissions.
New York passed the first truth-in-testing law last summer,despite dire predictions 
from the College Entrance Examination 
Board (popularly known as CEEB or as the 
College Board), which administers most of 
the tests. The agency warned it would 
have to re-write every test if the answers 
were available to the public, and that costs 
would rise accordingly.
Bob Cameron of the College Board says 
that each test used to cost $83,000 to de
velop and administer. New Yorks law has 
pushed the cost to $97,000, he says.
Consequently the College Board has an
nounced on October 9 that it was offering' 
the Scholatic Aptitude Test (SAT) in New 
York only four times this year, instead of 
the usual eight. The test fees charged to the 
350,000 New Yorkers who annually sit for 
the exam will also rise an undisclosed 
amount from the current $8.50.
Cameron adds the College Board will 
also stop offering special test sessions to 
students who cant make it to the regular 
sessions. He emphasises the cutbacks are all 
caused by the added costs of the New York 
law.
There are even more drastic visions of 
the bills effects. Richard Berendzen, presthat nationwide truth-in-testing legislation 
could mean the end oi standardized testing 
altogether.
The testing companies claims are to
tally false, counters Joel Packer, lobbyist 
for the United States Student Association. 
The bills will mean a better understanding 
of the test for students. It will not abolish 
the tests.
Students are capjtive consumers in the 
standardized testing business, explains Ed 
Hanley, an aide in Ralph Naders office 
who is working on a long-awaited Nader 
study of the industry.
Since these tests play such an impor
tant part in peoples lives, they need to be 
open.
Trustees meet

Department of Defense funding and the 
development of the biology department. 
Berg stressed that the research-oriented in
stitution is going to be the rule, not the 
exception, in the future because of a 
nationally declining student body.
Cyert took the podium once again and 
commented, in agreement with Berg, that 
there will be a decline in the number of 
students in the 1980s, but that we may 
or may not be affected...[If we are affec
ted, one possibility would be to] shift cer
tain departments over and make them re
search-oriented. He mentioned another 
possibility: Some professors could be 100% 
research, and have no teaching duties. The 
idea of increasing the amount of corporation-sponsored research brought some dis
cussion among the trustees. Cyert said, 
CMU avoids secret research, but added 
that policies may have to be modified so 
that these firms will get some benefit from 
their contributions to research done at 
CMU.
Comments were later heard from several 
of the trustees and representatives at the 
meeting.

Blood[ Sweat, & Tears deliver exciting Homecoming concert
by Ted Smits
One of the few successful events of this 
years cold, rainy homecoming weekend 
was the Blood, Sweat & Tears concert 
Sunday night in the CMU gym. Both BS&T 
and opening act Michael Johnson delivered 
exciting, entertaining performances that 
were well received by the audience.
Formed in the late sixties, BS&T rocketted to commercial success with a variety 
of pop-rock singles such as When I Die, 
Spinning Whefel and Youve Made Me 
So Very Happy. But besides the distinc
tive lead vocals of David Clay ton-Thomas, 
the band that performed at CMU is com
pletely different from the original BS&T 
that sold over thirty million albums in the
many of the audience enjoyed reggae mu
sic he dove into one of the nights better 
songs Youre the One. A romantic ballad 
with a partial reggae beat, the song demon
strated not only the strengths of ClaytonThomas vocals but also the depth of quali
ty jazz musicians in the band. Reportedly 
almost thirty-five different jazz musicians 
from New York and Canada have played 
with the band over the last ten years. Cur
rently BS&T features Bobby Economo on 
drums, David and Rob Piltch on bass and 
Rick; Martinez on keyboards. With the ad
dition of the horn section of Bruce Cassi
dy, Jern Dorge and Earl Seymour, BS&T 
has developed into one of the freshest and
Singer-songwriter Michael opened the Blood, Sweat, and Tears concert with a tasteful and entertain
mg set.
early seventies. This was apparent early in 
the concert when they grouped the afore
mentioned songs with their other early hits 
God Bless the Child and Lucretia 
MacEvil in a fifteen minute medley. The 
rest of the show featured basic jazz and 
rhythm and blues tunes along with some 
numbers from David Clayton-Thomas 
solo albums.
The band opended with the instrumen
tal Agitato and then Clayton-Thomas 
appeared to sing the bluesy Laying 
Down Rock and Roll. After checking how
most talented jazz combos around.
The end of the concert was composed 
of a number of jazz classics such as Span
ish Wine, Drown in my Own Tears and 
Gimme that Wine. The students who 
were able to tear themselves away from 
their books long enough to catch the show 
all seemed to have a good time and were 
also treated to a pleasant surprise in regard 
to the high quality sound in the gym. Past 
concerts in the gym have been hurt by 
poor sound quality sound but the good, 
strong mix and lack of echo effects at this
Jem Dorge, hornplayer of BS&T, gives one of his gym.
concert demonstrated that the gym can be 
used effectively for concerts.
Before the show I talked with the 
saxophone player Earl Seymour. Like 
most of the members of the group he is 
a young jazz musician who was living 
in Toronto at the time that ClaytonThomas asked him to join the group, 
He has been with the band almost a year 
now and has been touring with the current 
lineup for the last eight months. The CMU 
show is to be the last BS&T of this year. 
This week they start work in the studio 
on a new album. After this album is releas
ed they should embark on a large promo
tional tour next year.
Seymour is, like the rest of the band 
aware of the difference between the bands 
current musical style and the publics con
ception of the group. Fortunately most of 
the fans attracted to their show because 
of the old hits should enjoy the jamming, 
improvisational work and talented soloing 
by all members of the group. The best mo
ments of the groups performances were 
probably the solos by various members and 
the times when David Clayton-Thomas 
really cooked into one of the rythm and 
blues numbers. During our interview, 
Seymour had remarked on his terrific 
solo during one of the last songs and sure

by Karen Stevens 
Elegant, yet affordable is an excel
lent way to describe Ninos of Oakland. 
Ninos is a delightful restaurant to dine at 
when that special evening arrives, for a 
relaxing night on the town, or perhaps a 
lunchtime feast.
The Oakland area often 
surprises many people with 
its hidden culture and 
Ninos is one of its con
cealed secrets. When passing through the 
entrance way one is immediately taken in 
by the gilded and marbled .decor, the 
aroma of the daily entrees, and the soft 
music of the pianist in the lounge. After 
being warmly greeted by the hostess and 
led to one of its many small dining areas 
(a complaint could be issued concerning 
the closeness of tables), the customer is 
presented with a menu overflowing with 
appealing entrees priced from $6-$ 14. 
Seafood, veal, Italian dishes, and beef all 
offer various options to the clientele.
On my visit I selected Veal Scalloppini 
a la Nino which consisted of eight wellportioned, extremely tender pieces of veal 
sauteed with green peppers and onions in
a gravy lightly seasoned with wine. Inclu
ded in all meals is a choice of soup, vege
tables or potatoes, and one of three salads. 
My guest had Shrimp Scamp, large shrimp 
sauteed in garlic butter with a hint of 
bread crumbs, which she described as 
excellent. Our bill, including the full 
course meal, drinks, and dessert was $28.
Desserts such as Cannoli (a soft cheese 
mixed with nuts stuffed in a wrapped 
sugar cookie), cheesecake (chocolate or 
with strawberries), pecan balls, and numer
ous others are all homemade, making them 
one of Ninos greatest attractions.
Another option that makes Ninos 
al versatile place to dine is its luncheon 
menu. Moderately priced meals ($3 - $7) 
provide the possibility of making your 
big meal of the day lunch. They offer 
sandwiches as well as hot main dishes 
(crabmeat and turkey/bacon devonshires 
are two of the best). Two people can easily 
leave quite satisfied for $10.
Located at 214 N. Craig Street, CMU 
students can make access to the restaurant 
by taking a PAT bus 71 Negley or a cab for 
a fare of $1 - $2. (Free parking is offered 
across the street to car owners). Dinner and 
lunch are served Monday through Satur
day, a jacket is required for men at dinner, 
and all credit cards are accepted. Enter
tainment is provided in the lounge by a 
talented Shirley Friedman who adds to 
the atmosphere with her mellow tones. 
Dont miss out on a truly enjoyable eve
ning/afternoon. Call 621-2700 for reser
vations.
Nino's is located at 214 N. Craig St., Oakland.
many excellent solos during the concert in the
enough that solo like the rest of the show 
was terrific and enjoyed by almost all who 
were there.
Opening the show was singer-songwriter 
Michael Johnson. Accompanied by an 
accustic guitar, Johnsons set of basically 
original material went over well with the 
audience and was a fine prelude to the 
BS&T show. He performed a number of his 
old favorites as well as his current hits 
Bluer than Blue and Almost Like Being 
in Love. The best moments of the set 
were his humorous songs like The Won
derful World of Sexand The Garbage Can 
Song. Also interspersed among the old fa
vorites were a few songs from his new al
bum Dialogue.
Before BS&T took the stage Johnson 
talked about his reaction to the show. He 
felt he received a really great reception 
and that the audience was  attentive and 
energetic. Now living in Minneasota, 
Johnson has been touring regularly as well 
as appearing on television shows like the 
Merv Griffin Show. He is now in the pro
cess of writing songs for a new album 
but he did not try out any of his new ma
terial in his opening set. He feels that there 
is such a difference between the studio and 
performing live that unless you can get 
into the mood he is better off sticking to 
the proven winners that the crowd enjoys.

/.WQED has Halloween entertainment scheduled
The Many Faces of Tom SaviniBloomfield-born Tom Savini, make-up and special effects wizard 
("Dawn of the Dead," "Martin) is the subject of WQED Presents: Tom Savini-Master of Metamor
phosis, a Halloween special to be broadcast Wednesday, October 31 at 7 PM on WQED/13.
Long before the stroke of midnight on 
Wednesday, October 31 WQED/13 will 
begin a Halloween celebration that will 
amaze and delight viewers. WQED PRE
SENTS: TOM SAVINI - MASTER OF 
METAMORPHOSIS (7 PM) will profile the 
native of Bloomfield whose achievements 
in make-up and special effects ( Martin, 
Dawn of the Dead) have made him 
internationally famous. COUNT DRAC
ULA, a Great Performances adaptation of 
Bram Stokers classic, starring Louis Jourdan as the infamous vampire king, will 
begin at 9 PM and continue for three 
suspenseful hours.
TOM SAVINI: MASTER OF META
MORPHOSIS is a conversation with Tom 
about his career, his ambitions, and most 
of all, his craft. I spent my childhood in
the Palace Theatre in Bloomfield, he 
explains. At the age of 13 he had marvelled 
at Lon Chaney, Sr.s performance as 
The Man of a Thousand Faces, and 
rushed home to begin experimenting with 
make-up. Nineteen years later, Tom Savini 
is still experimenting, and part of the halfhour WQED PRESENTS which focuses on 
him is devoted to his demonstration of 
technique and methods for applying make
up and creating special effects.
Although make-up is his primary profes
sion, Tom Savini is also an actor, a stunt
man, a special effects man and a photog
rapher. His credits include over 70 stage 
productions; two Bob Clark films (De
ranged and The Dead of the Night,) 
and other films, including George Ro

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER M/F
by Bob Henry
Combine sometime distressing direction 
and a decidedly weak script and one gets 
an overall disappointing night at the the
atre  the Point Park College Theatre Com
panys production of Christopher Durangs 
A History of the American Film at the 
Pittsburgh Playhouse.
The cast does a good job with the 
material, and director Thomas Hischak is 
often inventive and clever, but the fre
quent almost-blackouts and rocky scene 
changes between the many different 
skits in the show give the production an 
annoying jerkiness and choppiness.
The story follows a group of characters 
through the twentieth century, using par
odies of bits drawn from over 25 movies 
to tell the story. Unfortunately, author 
Durangs reaching hither and fro for a 
laugh often irritates. Too often he sati
rizes obscure moments from obscure 
films, and even when the satirized moment 
is more familiar, the humor too often 
comes from Oh, I know what hes trying
to satire instead of from thats funny. 
After writing a first act that is more enter
taining and amusing than not, Durang has 
provided a close-to-abysmal second act. He 
tries to get much of his humor in the 
second act from impotence, amputation, 
and polio, and if you dont find it offen
sive youll probably find it boring.
The cast, however, mines almost all of 
the scripts theatrical jewels. They por
tray the more than 30 characters excel
lently, and give the show a refreshing 
vitality and energy. Clever costumes by 
Don di Fonso and entertaining chore
ography by David Vinski add to the 
merriment and help provide the needed 
zip and zing. The songs are not tunes 
youll hum on the way out. Neither are 
they meant to be; overall. Mel Marvins 
music may be more satisfying than Dur
angs script.
The first act of A History of the Ameri
can Film is a fun hour-plus of theatre 
The show, unfortunately, goes downhill 
after intermission.

Leonard Nimoy discusses new Star Trek film
By Leonard Nimoy
(FOCUS) Now that we have completed
filming STAR TREK-The Motion Picture,
I can look back upon it as a very special ex
perience.
It has been a long, complex, often 
difficult and extremely challenging movie 
to make. But, throughout, one thing 
seemed evident to all of us who had re
turned to the crew of the Starship Enter
prise. A rare chemistry - rare certainly for
Beatlemania
by Alan Spero
Beatlemania will be invading the Stan
ley Theatre from October 31st until Nov
ember 11th. The multi-media produc
tion traces the Fab Four from Liverpool 
to Apple Records using two sets of four 
actors to perform over forty Beatle tunes.
Don Lanaris as Paul, Chris Gavin as 
George, Marshall Crenshaw as John, and 
A1 Sapunza as Ringo, will be playing and 
singing a wide variety of songs, such as 
Nowhere Man, Let It Be, Revo
lution, and Rock n Roll Music. They 
will be backed by an audio-visual extraveganza so spectacular as to set a new trend 
in theatre multi-media production. The 
show encorporates multiple slide pro
jectors, movie projectors , 9 effects pro
jectors and almost 2000 slides depicting 
the world of the sixties and changing in 
time to the music. It took over 36 artists, 
photographers, and designers to create the 
production.
Beatlemania will be playing at the Stan
ley Theatre Tuesdays thru Thursdays at 
7:30 PM, Fridays and Saturdays at 7:30 
and 10:00 PM, and Sundays at 7:00 and 
9:00 PM. There will be no performances on 
Mondays. Tickets are available at the Stan
ley Theatre box office, all National Re
cord Marts, and at Kaufmans.
any group of nine performers - still existed 
among us even a dozen years or so after 
we first had sensed it.
When we began working together in the 
Star Trek" television series, some months 
before it first appeared on the air in 1966. 
we soon realized that we were blessed 
with a strong feeling for each other as peo
ple. t That chemistry quickly seemed to 
extend over to the relationship between 
each of us and the character each had been 
chosen to play.
Most of us had seen each other only 
occasionally since the final TV episode had 
been filmed, in 1968. Certainly, we all 
had changed somewhat in the intervening 
years. But. now it was like a family 
reunion, a tenth anniversary celebration 
of our last get-together.
It was gratifying, too, to discover our 
fine director. Robert Wise, sharing our 
feelings. Of course, our producer. Gene 
Roddenberry, who created the original 
series, always has been part of the 
family.
Now, all this may seem a little emotion
al for Mr. Spock. But, it has been that 
kind of an emotional, special experience.
Speaking of my pointed-ear friend, its 
only logical (as he might put it) that I 
should set the record straight regarding 
our association.
From the time I arrived back on the 
bridge of the Enterprise and we began 
filming STAR TREK - The Motion Pic
ture, Ive been repeatedly asked the 
same question.
Why were you reluctant to play Spock 
again?
As far as Ive been able to conclude, 
there seem to be two reasons for the ques
tion, and the assumption it makes.
First - at one point when a new Star 
Trek production was scheduled, I hap
pened to under contract to appear on the
Broadway stage in Equus. It was report
ed that Star Trek would be made with
out me.
Assumption: I didn't want to be in it.
Fact: 1 simply was not available.
Second - a few years back. 1 wrote a 
book published under the title, I Am 
Not Spock.
Assumption: 1 no longer liked playing
Mr. Spock.
Fact: As any reader of the book would 
have discovered, it dealt with my life as 
an actor and my relationship with the vari
ous, diverse characters 1 have played, in
cluding Spock. It was anything but a dis
paragement of the role.
To the contrary. I've always felt 
totally comfortable about being identi
fied with "Star Trek and with the Spock 
character. Both have been such a positive 
influence on my lifeI'm grateful for the 
association, Im proud of it - and I never 
in any way have tried to reject it.
Its success doubtless has contributed to
other important acting opportunities that 
have come my way, and it has not restric
ted their nature, either on the stage or in 
films. Ive had a chance to portray Dr. 
Dysart in Equus, Tevye in Fiddler on 
the Roof, McMurphy in One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest, Fagin in Oliver, 
Dr. Kibner in Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers. Sine completing the Star 
Trek movie, I've touredun my one-man 
show, "Vincent, playing Theo Van Gogh 
as he talks about his more famous brother.
None of those roles bears any resem
blance to Spock. Of course, there are 
big differences between him and me, too, 
besides those ears and up-swept eyebrows.
However, any character played by an 
actor for three years, and closely identi
fied with him for a decade after that, is 
bound to have an affect on him. I consider 
myself to be a rather emotional person. 
But, Ill have to admit I have become much 
more rational and logical since making the 
acquaintance of Mr. Spock.

On Music
Brand X offers fresh and inventive music on new release
by David Kirby
Tired of the same old music? Got them 
all boogied-out blues? Has your rock lost 
its roll? Well, weve got the answer to your 
problem. Try Brand X. No aftertaste. No 
artificial flavoring, no preserves.
If TV commercials were more common 
to records, such might read the one for this 
weeks selection, Product by Brand X. 
(Yes, there really is a band called Brand X.) 
Unlike most of the things "there are TV 
commercials for, this is different.
Brand X is a totally irreverent collection 
of Britains, namely: Drums, Phil Collins 
(from Genesis) and Mike Clarke; key
boards, Robin Lumley and Peter Robinson; 
ba^s, Percy Jones and John Giblin; guitar, 
John Goodsall, and percussion, Morris Pert. 
They perform, in various combinations, a 
unique mixture of Jazz, Progressive Rock, 
and good ol Rock N Roll. The album is 
produced by the group, and they have an 
absolutely maniacal sense of record pro
duction, which sometimes borders on 
genius. Throughout the years (this is their 
fifth album), they have graced us with 
such memorable hits as Euthanasia 
Waltz, Why Should I Lend You Mine, 
When Youve Broken Yours Already, 
Nightmare Patrol, and Dance of the 
Illegal Aliens.
This is the first time there have actual
ly been lyrics in their music, and Phil Col
lins handles the singing in a brusk, threat
ening tone that is a real departure from his 
singing with Genisis. Dont Make Waves, 
one of the vocal selections, opens side one 
with a tight, almost bluesy arrangement, 
with Collins telling us at one point, If you 
dont want a hassle, play like an asshole. 
Alright, alright already!
The rest of the album, except for one 
other cut, is instrumental, assuming dif
ferent aspects of the progressive approach. 
On Wal to Wal, Collins and the two 
bassists provide a rather bizarre instru
mental piece that seems to echo the in
strumental approach of the Ohio-based 
industrial rock bands. April, the last cut 
on side two, is a quiet, introspective bass 
solo by Giblin with an outro that sounds 
like the organic fluttering of Yess Close 
To The Edge.

Dean on Watergate
continued from page 1
In attempting to answer the question, 
Could it happen again? Dean focused on 
what he felt were the causes of Watergate 
and whether or not they still exist today.
To me there is little doubt that there 
could be another cover-up. If a president 
makes a mistake, I doubt he is going to 
put out a press release. That is just human 
nature, Dean said.
Next Dean posed the question of the 
actual cause of the scandal: Whether it was 
a lack of character in Richard Nixon and 
his aides that caused Watergate or a com
bination of that and the pressure on a pres
ident to remain in office that motivated 
the scandal? I have no credentials to talk 
about other peoples character, Dean 
commented yet I do not subscribe to that 
simplistic view [that it was merely a lack 
of character that caused the scandal]. 
There are other factors to consider.
Dean explained his view of the presi
dency: The office doesnt seek the man, 
the man seeks the office. Unfortunately 
there is a certain amount of rounding of 
corners when this occurs. I am not saying 
that a saint could not be president, just 
that it is unlikely hell ever win. Specific
ally to Nixon, he added, He took things 
like the war demonstrations and Congress 
not agreeing with him (on certain topics) as 
a personal affront. He lost his perspective.
Dean also said that people knew of Nix
ons character propensities; that is, when 
things got rough, Nixon got down and dir
ty. He referred to a poll taken recently 
which inquired about voters choices in the
1972 election for president given that they 
had knowledge of Watergate. The response 
was, significantly, similar to the actual 
election results for that year. Dean also 
made reference to a Los Angeles Times 
poll which asked if those polled thought 
that it was acceptable for a president to 
bend the rules. A majority of those pol
led said yes, according to Dean.
Dean further explained that he had 
always felt like an outsider in the Nixon 
administration. He related the following 
story: Nixon asked him to initiate an audit 
on a magazine that ran an article on a sup
posed proposal made by Spiro Agnew, 
former Vice President, to cancel the 1972 
elections and repeal the Bill of Rights. The 
story proved to be unfounded,and shortly 
thereafter, the magazine folded. Nixon still 
insisted that an audit be made. Although 
Dean did not initiate the audit, he was 
aware that the IRS had been contacted but 
failed to stop the investigation. He said he 
knew then that I had crossed the [ethical 
or possibly legal] line.
Dean specified climate as an impor
tant part of the reason that Watergate hap
pened. Part of the ambience still exists, he 
pointed out, like the them vs. us attitude 
of White House staffers, or the more than 
likely formation of an enemies list. Dean 
also pointed out, however, that part of the 
climate of the 1972 election does not still 
exist. As an example Dean cited the fact 
that the Nixon campaign raised over $60 
million for the 1972 campaign; such large 
sums of money could not be raised now 
due to changed campaign finance laws and 
a depressed economy. It is not practical, 
financially or otherwise, anymore for a 
candidate to divert sums of money to pay 
for electronic surveillance. That money is 
better spent on advertising, Dean explain
ed.
In closing his lecture, Dean said that he 
viewed his role in the Watergate conspiracy 
with some embarrassment. It was the 
worst experience of my life, he commen
ted. But he now views it as a learning ex
perience. Unlike Mr. Nixon, I really 
dont care how history treats me. Nothing
I can say or do will change history. I will 
have to accept that fact. I feel sorry for 
Richard Nixon; he is still campaigning for 
the role of former President. He must be 
very frustrated, Dean concluded.
After the lecture, Dean accepted ques
tions. He was asked how he felt about for
mer President Gerald Fords pardon of Nix
on. He responded, I think it was a good 
idea, 1?ut it may have worked out better for 
everyone if Nixon had been forced to 
cooperate more with the Senate committee 
investigating the cover-up. At the same 
time, however, it is important to realize 
that Ford thought his administration need
ed to be free of any burden of Watergate. 
It was a decision which may have cost him 
the election in 1976.
Another question directed toward Dean 
asked about his knowledge of Deep 
Throat, the alleged White House source to 
the Washington Post during the Watergate 
era.
This was the only part of Watergate 
that was fun, he answered. I have an idea 
of who it is and I am in contact with this 
person. Right now, its only an educated 
guess, but someday you all may know the 
result of my efforts.
Finally, Dean fielded questions pertain
ing to his personal life after Watergate. 
Life in a minimum security jail is certain
ly not the hell-hole of the maximum sec
urity jail, but it is no piece of cake either. I 
am glad to be out...As far as my home life 
is concerned, I guess the best result of the 
whole affair is the improvement of my 
marriage. My wife and I communicate 
much more now than we ever did before, 
and that is really important to both of us, 
Dean concluded in an interview with the 
TARTAN and WRCT immediately after 
the lecture.

by Ingnatious T. Butz
The Tartans of CMU continued their 
rampage of the PAC by destroying Alle
gheny and John Carroll on successive week
ends. Allegheny was pummeled, 26-0 and 
John Carroll fell pjey to the strong second 
half play of the Tartan machine, 27-7. The 
Tartans are now 8-0 going into the last con
ference game agains Thie^. A CMU win over 
the Tomcats would secure the PAC crown 
for the third consecutive season and would 
ensure an NCAA Division III playoff spot 
once again for Chuck Klausings Tartans.
In front of a Homecoming crowd at Al
legheny, the Tartan offense rolled up 455 
total offensive yards, only 97 of which 
came through the air. Bob Gasior rolled up 
137 yards rushing on 31 carries and one 
touchdown to lead the Tartan attack. Rick 
Leaman carried 15 times for 84 yards and 
Perry Colosimo, Jeff Harrison, and Gene 
Marcink combined for an additional 140 
yards. Bob Kennedy completed six of ten 
passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns. 
Jeff Harrison scored the final touchdown 
oh a 4 yard jaunt.
Leading only 7-0 at the half, the Tartans 
came on strong in the second half to con
trol the ball for 22 of the 30 minutes in the 
half, and scored 19 points. Moes Mani
acs combined for their 4th shutout of the 
season as the Gator offensive attack was 
stuffed.
In last weeks game against the John 
Carroll Blue Streaks, CMU once again lead 
by only a touchdown at the half. Time 
after time, the stubborn John Carroll 
defense forced the Tartans to punt the ball 
away. Meanwhile, the Blue Streak offense 
was busy picking apart the Plaid Curtain 
on its way to an apparent touchdown late 
in the 1st quarter. John Carrolls power Iformations and quick counters caught the 
blitzing Tartan linebackers off-guard. How
ever, the CMU defense stiffened and forced 
John Carroll to attempt a field goal. John 
Carrolls Mark Shroeder was sent into the 
game to kick the chip-shot 14 yarder. How
ever, his attempt was wide and the Tartan 
offense took over at their own 20 yard 
line.
Once again, CMU was forced to punt, 
and this time John Carroll mounted a drive 
which ended at the CMU 37 yard line when 
a Mark Shroeder 43 yard field goal attempt 
hit the crossbar and was declared no good. 
So it seemed that Moes Maniacs would 
once again shut out their opponents. Not 
to be, though, as a 4th quarter desperation 
pass from John Carrolls John Fortner was 
rebounded by Ed Cornell for John Car
rolls only score. Shucks!
Rick Leaman scored CMUs only touch 
down of the half on a five-yard counter 
and Denny Postufka booted the extra 
point. Postufka had a fine day, hitting two
TARTAN SPIRIT-CMU football has experienced 
Tartans hope to fill the stadium once again when
field goals, a 44 yarder in the third quarter, 
and a 29 yarder in the fourth quarter, and 
nailing 3 PATs for a total of nine points on 
the day. Greg Samsas 4th quarter 30 yard 
steam roll gave CMU its final score of the 
game. It came on a roll out pass from Bob 
Kennedy. In the final analysis of the con
test, CMUs ability to capitalize on John 
Carrolls three fumbles provided the differLinebackers big hit with CMU defense
This is the second of a series covering 
our Tartan football champions. Three 
weeks ago we dealt with the outstanding 
defensive line. Now we provide you with 
an analysis of the linebacking corps. 
The Tartans use the Oklahoma, or 5-2 
defense. This means there are five de
fensive linemen whose job is to rush the 
quarterback on pass plays and prevent 
opposing offensive linemen from open
ing holes for their backs. There are also 
four men in the secondary who must 
cover the opposing receivers. This leaves 
only two linebackers to prevent long 
runs should the defensive line fail to 
make a play, or on passing plays they 
must stick to the offensive backs who 
are as big and usually quicker than line
backers. Yet this defense works effective
ly. With one game remaining, the Tartans 
have outscored the opposition 242-31. 
The 31 points the defense has given up are 
misleading. They are actually better than 
that. The first points they gave up came 
in Game number 3 against Hiram, a 
36-yard field goal after the opposition took 
possession on the CMU-34. Then in Game
number 5, Bethany, the team with last 
years top quarterback in the conference 
(Tartan QB Bob Kennedy was 2nd) scored 
two touchdowns on drives of 32 and 15 
yards. In the Homecoming game a week 
later, Washington Jefferson scored after 
recovering a Tartan fumble four yards 
away from the goal line.
To learn the secrets of the defense, 
I talked to a man who should know. For 
four years he played linebacker for the 
Tartans and was named to the PAC AllConference his last three years; he was 
conference MVP in 1976; First Team 
Academic All-American in 1976; Second 
Team All-American last year; he was 
named to the Pittsburgh Press All-District 
team and won the Post-Gazette Dapper 
Dan Award. In Rich Lackner, the Tartans 
have a co^ch who has the experience of 
knowing the linebacking assignments and 
he knows first hand the strengths and 
weaknesses of his players because he 
played on the gridiron for the defenses 
excellence. The offense has been able to 
control the football consistently, and 
they have been able to prevent the serious 
injury which could cause long absences.
Filling the gap"Mike' 
back
He gave credit to trainer Mark Kepplers 
flexibility exercises for the welcome 
shortage of muscle pulls.
Another reason Coach Lackner cited 
was the Defensive Coordinator Richard 
Smith. During my interview of Coach 
Lackner, I had the pleasure of meeting 
Moe Smith. He is light-hearted at times 
when dealing with his assistants, but 
when there is a job to be done he gets it 
done. Since his coming to CMU he has * 
instilled pride in the Plaid Curtain defen
sive unit, which is known also as Moes 
Maniacs. Smiths concepts for team unity 
are the most important reasons for the out
standing accomplishments of the Tartan 
defense. Coach Smiths style is one of 
disciplined and aggressive football and his 
attitude has rubbed off on all of the 
players.
The two starting linebackers are senior 
Pat Olivo and junior Chip Miller. Playing 
the weak or Mike side, Olivo has, in 
Coach Lackners words,a good nose for 
the football. This evaluation proves to 
be statistically accurate as he is the teams 
leading defender with 30 tackles and 25 
assists. The Sam side is covered by Chip 
'Miller who succeeds Rich Lackner at the 
strong side linebacker spot. He has 20 
tackles and 24 assists. His predecessor had 
this to say about Miller,a good, hard
hitting player who really sticks it to the 
opposing offenses. His pass coverage has 
improved each week since the beginning 
of the year. It is Miller who calls the 
defensive plays in the huddle, and with 
sixty-plus variations of the Oklahoma, 
his job is not an easy one.
The Tartans are blessed with great 
depth at the linebacking spots. Senior 
Fastuca is coming back from a year in 
which he was given All-PAC Honorable 
$ Mention. He is very versatile; he can play 
1 Flex-man, Middle, or Mut line>. backer and defensive end. He has 21 tack-v. les and 13 assists and has also picked off 
> a pass and recovered a fumble, 
o Sophomore Ken Murawski, 24 tackles 
c and 14 assists, will, in all likelihood, be 
Linebacker, Pat Olivo, No. 63, splits the seam to crush an opposing running Starting next year. Ken is quick, agile and
a dramatic increase in fan support this season. The 
they face Thiel,
ence in the game.

Banner rules
Athletic Director, James Banner has 
announced that the CMU vs. Thiel game 
will be played at Tech Bowl at 1:30 PM on 
Saturday, November 3, as originally sche
duled. Administrative and maintenance 
difficulties prevented the Tartans from 
playing at Three Rivers Stadium, where 
the Pittsburgh Steelers host Washington on 
Sunday. The fact that the Tartans wont be 
playing Thiel at Three Rives should in no 
way put a damper on next weeks show
down, however. Thiel remains one game 
behind CMU, with a 5-1 conference record 
and if they should pull off an upset, will 
unseed CMU as PAC champions. Thiels 
offense and defense are number two be
hind CMU, who leads in both categories. 
Their offense features two-time PAC 
player of the week, tailback, Ron Leuschen, who leads the conference in rush
ing, averaging 120 yards per game. He 
gave last years defense all they could 
handle, and should be an even bigger 
threat this year. Thiels defense has al
lowed an average of only 186.8 offen
sive yards per game.

Linebackers big hit
disiplined. His three interceptions re
turned for 52 yards are reason for his 
coich calling him the best pass defender 
of the many linebackers. He blitzes ex
tremely well but the reason the coach has 
great respect for him is he covers mistakes 
with his outstanding quickness.
Lee Ferketic, has eight tackles and six 
assists, most of which come on the suicide 
squads  defending kicks and punts, the 
destiny of most freshmen because it is so 
difficult for newcomers to break into the 
starting line-up of a championship team.
He and three other freshmen, Joe Schinozi, 
Mike Byrne and Bill Clouse, all of whom 
play on the Scout Team, i.e. they run the 
oppositions plays during practice sessions 
in the middle of the week; are all 
considered outstanding prospects by Coach 
Lackner. Lackner also had praise for junior 
Doug Carney, who is always plugging 
away and always gives 100 percent.
To close this article, let me give you, 
in Coach Lackners words, his evaluation 
of the entire squad: They are all very 
team oriented. Team Defense is more 
important to them than individual sta
tistics.

by Pat Crump
Last week, the Tartans of CMU took on 
the Allegheny Gators. This was the most 
spirited game of the year. Both teams were 
aggressive, passed well, played hard and put 
true effort and spirit into the game.
CMU put all their extensive practice to 
play here, passing crisply and creating per
fect plays. But Allegheny scored first, fir
ing up CMU; who scored moments later on 
a boot by Mike Winstell. The end of the 
first half left the teams tied 1 -1.
On this day, our fairy godmother (long 
live Wayne) was with us all the way. Alleg
heny scored again. Undaunted, Bob Messmer retaliated, enabling Carl Pavelto to 
stick Allegheny in the ribs again. The more 
CMU scored, the better they played, dom
inating until Allegheny scored on them
selves, courtesy of Bob Messmer, later fol
lowed by freshman Joel Dreskins superb 
shot, far from the net, which bored its way 
through Alleghenys goalie.
Cheering from the rowdy CMU fan club 
helped tremendously to dishearten the Gat
ors fans and team, led by five ex-lettermen 
and their entourage of four carloads. CMU 
ripped Allegheny, 4-2.
In a game played the previous week, 
CMU once again came through in the 
clutch. Playing on a messy, slippery field, 
CMU looked like they needed an oversize 
pinball machine to work over the St. Vin
cent squad. The spectators might have been 
watching tennis for the frequency of the 
turnovers, yet after only seven minutes, on 
a perfect pass from Canepa, Bob Messmer 
plastered the St. Vincent goalie, scoring 
CMUs first goal.
CMUs domination continued and with 
24 minutes gone, Carl Pavelko crossed to 
Bob Messmer, who once again slammed his 
shot past their goalie, ending the half with 
CMU 2, St. Vincent 0.
The second half was vivified by another 
score, initiated by a Canepa throw-in, and 
again stuffed on by Messmer. Later in the 
period, St. Vincent came alive, scoring 
twice and throwing a minor scare into the 
Tartans. However, CMU won, 3-2.
Injuries plague harriers
by Bill Rogers
CMUs cross-country team has been 
busy gearing up for the conference meet 
this Saturday, as they compiled a 3-2 
record over the past three weeks.
The Harriers shut out W&J during 
homecoming weekend, 15-50. Dario Donatelli, Scott Kidd, and Craig Woolheater tied 
for first place with a 5 mile trek in 26:30.
On October 20, the Tartans traveled to 
Cleveland where they shut out Hiram 15- 
50, but lost to West Virginias Glenville 
St., 25-30. Craig Woolheater took first 
with a time of 26:26, while second place 
went to Donatelli. Steve Bailey, Bemie 
Ivanshultz, and John Wachter also placed 
for the Tartans.
This past weekend saw the Tartan edged 
by Bethany 27-29, but nip Allegheny 24-
32, in what might have been the top three 
teams in the conference. Donatelli and 
Woolheater tied for first place with a time 
of 26:54, The highlight of the meet was 
the performance of CMUs freshmen run
ners as Mark Knapp overcame an injury 
to place ninth, while much improved Ran
dy Anderson cut a full minute off of his 
best time. The Tartans performance was 
hindered by the loss of Bemie Ivanshultz, 
who turned an ankle during the first part 
of the race and was forced to drop out, 
and Steve Bailey, who tore ligaments dur
ing a practice, and was operated on last 
Friday.
Hopefully, CMU will be at full strength 
Saturday when they defend their 1978 
championship at Bethany College.
Be a sport.
PAC 'Player of the Week'
For the first time this season, an individ
ual has claimed the Presidents Athletic 
Conference Player of the Week award 
for the second time.
Thiels Ron Leuschen wins the laurels 
after his efforts helped Thiel defeat Wash
ington & Jefferson, 12-10 in Washington, 
to remain one-game behind CMU in the 79 
grid title chase.
Leuschen, a 5-10, 180-pound tailback, 
rushed 26 timesboth seasonand careerhigjisfor a net of 199 yards. In addition, 
he tallied both of ThiePs touchdowns, on
runs of 14 and 74 yards, while catching 
one pass for 26 markers.
At present, he paces the PAC in rushing, 
averaging 120 yards per game, and scoring, 
tallying 10.4 points per game, with totals 
of 600 yards and 52 points.
The Erie native, a graduate of McDowell 
High School, won the honor earlier this 
season after a 20-carry, 105-yard, twotouchdown performance versus Bethany.
