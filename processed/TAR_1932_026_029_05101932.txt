Alumni Association Launches Campaign 
For Membership
Members Are Taken From 
All Graduates of 
Carnegie
DUES ARE $2 A YEAR
Seniors Are Urged to At
tend Alumni Dance 
Saturday, May 28
With the assistance of senior 
representatives from each depart
ment of the college, the Alumni 
Association of Carnegie Institute 
of Technology tomorrow launches 
its first annual campaign for alumni 
membership among the seniors. 
Final arrangements for the cam
paign will be discussed tonight at 
a dinner at the Cathedral Mansions 
Coffee Shop.
The Alumni Federation is com
posed of a combination of the 
alumni associations of the College 
of Engineering, College of Indus
tries, College of Fine Arts, and the 
Margaret Morrison College. Each 
association is composed of 10 
alumni of the respective colleges, 
who hold office for a period of 
two years.
Alumni membership is available 
to all graduates of Carnegie who 
receive either certificates, diploma, 
or degrees. Students who have 
completed at least one year of day 
school or two years of regular 
night courses are eligible to asso
ciate membership in the organiza
tion.
The purpose of.the Federation is 
to keep all alumni informed with 
all activities on the Carnegie cam
pus. Since the organization is al
most entirely self-supporting, it 
cannot accomplish this scrvicc un
less a slight charge is  made. 
Alumni dues amount to $2 for the 
(seniors. This rate is exceedingly 
low as compared with the dues 
paid at other universities.
The drive for members will con
tinue until graduation, June 14. 
Membership cards will be issued 
at the Alumni office in the Gym
nasium upon presentation of the 
receipt for ^ucs. As a special fea
ture of the campaign each year, 
one of the four alumni associations 
a dance for the seniors, 
the Engineering Alumni 
will be hosts at a

MARY McKEON ELECTED 
SPRING CARNIVAL QUEEN
Coronation of Campus Queen Will
Be Held in Gymnasium on May 19
Ball Will Take Place in Thistle Hall and Gymnasium 
From 9 Until 1; Coronation to 
Start At 10
At 10 oclock in the evening of 
Thursday,. May 19, the Corona
tion of the Campus Queen will 
take place on the stage of the 
main co.urt in the Gymnasium. The. 
location was changed by the Car
nival committee from the front of 
Machinery Hall to this spot be
cause of the possibility of bad 
weather postponing the pageant.
The Coronation Ball which will 
be held simultaneously in Thistle 
Hall and the Gymnasium, starting 
at 9 oclock Thursday evening, 
will be called to a halt at 10 
oclock and' everybody present will 
adjourn to the Gymnasium to take 
part in the Coronation of the 
Queen.
Elizabeth Steele, the CampusQucen of the Spring Carnival last
year, will present the Queen with 
a crown of gold adorned with 
pearls.
For the Coronation, the Queen 
will wear a modern gown of white 
satin . whileher two maids of 
honor will be dressed in organdie 
gowns and small hats. The. 12 
other girls composing the court 
will wear organdie gowns of pastel 
shades.
Majorie Lewine and Gloria Kloos 
are now working on the plans of 
the Coronation while Aulma Bless
ings assisted by Rachel Boyce, 
Katherine Winslow; Anna Jean 
Roberts, and Margaret Lewis, is 
designing the costumes for the 
affair.
At the conclusion of the pageant 
the Coronation Ball will be re
sumed and continue until 1 oclock.
SUMMER WORK 
NOW AVAILABLE
Bureau Investigation Shows 
Most Opportunity in 
Sales Work
Students who are interested in 
summer -employment arc urged to 
investigate the possibilities of sales 
work. According to present indi
cations  there will be few oppor
tunities for other employment this 
summer.
The Bureau of Recommendations 
realizes that sales work has always 
been distasteful to the students; 
but conditions arc rapidly chang
ing, and students must learn to 
change with them. Sales work, of 
course, offers more of a risk in 
regard to earnings, which, how
ever, may often result to the ad
vantage of the student. The young 
man or young woman who enters 
sales work has the advantage of 
less responsibilities and can there
fore afford to take more of a risk.
Business men realize that ex
perience gained while doing sales 
work is invaluable later, and there 
is no more ideal time to obtain 
this experience than during sum 
mcr vacations. This work is 
healthful, gives one self-confidence, 
and broadens ones contacts, fac
tors which may, materially affect 
his success later. Technical peo
ple, especially, seem to lack the 
broader view oflife and living 
which is necessary to real success, 
and the student who devotes his 
summers to meeting people and 
talking to them has made an ex
cellent step towards overcoming 
this.The Bureau will be glad to dis
cuss the -possibilities in this field 
with any student who is inter
ested. There are openings in such 
lines to sell cooking utensils, ma
chinery, insurance, wearing apparel 
magazines, securities, and other 
household and office articles.

EIGHTEEN ORGANIZATIONS ALREADY IN "PROPER SPIRIT'
Sororities and Fraternities 
Well-Represented in 
Heyday Parade
If the organizations to which 
you belong had the chance to win 
a silver loving cup simply by put
ting their most nonsensical ideas 
into the form of a float would 
you be in favor of having these 
ideas and making these floats? 
This is ft he question which has 
been asked of some fifty organized 
groups on the Carnegie campus by 
the Spring Carnival committee. Of 
this number eighteen organizations, 
including sororities, fraternities and 
dormitories, have already respond
ed with an enthusiastically affirma
tive reply. In addition to these, 
several groups have been working 
on ideas and are almost certain 
that they will enter the parade. 
It is not too late to enter, and 
those who have not sent in their 
plans to Mr. Davis, at the Y office 
arerequested to do so this week.

what floats!  It begins to look 
like what a parade! All plans 
for formation and line of march 
have been completed and every
thing, including Campus Cops, to 
keep things in order and traffic 
out of. congestion  have been ar
ranged for. The floats will as
semble on the Woodlawn avenue
hill, alongside of the lower part 
of the College of Industries, and 
at the order of . the chief of police 
will start up the hill, following 
Woodlawn avenue around in front

will pass the judges stand in front 
of Margaret Morrison and will then 
turn left to proceed through 
the campus between the College of

It will then pass the Administra

also become a reality, but our co

the only ones to benefit by them. 
The races will be run as dormitory

it is requested to put the names

TARTANS MEET 
GENEVA FRIDAY
Coulter Breaks Record As 
Plaid Downs W. & J. 
97Vz to 36Yz
This Friday the Carnegie track 
team journeys to Beaver Falls for 
their annual dual engagement with 
Geneva College. Last year the 
Covenanters took the measure of 
our /Skibos, and since the Gold 
and White is just asstrong this 
season, Carnegie must go into the. 
meet as the underdog. Geneva has 
one of the strongest teams in the 
district and boasts stars of na
tional prominence of the caliber of 
Spencer,. Rupp and Beggs. Spencer 
recently won the high jump at the 
Penn Relays and Beggs placed sec
ond in the javelin. Rupp is a 
weight -man who, with' Thomas, a 
sprinter, and Noultin and Douthit, 
distance stars, round out the nucleus 
of the team.
1 Carnegie annexed its fourth suc
cessive track and field .victory last 
week; when W.' & J. was decisively 
defeated by a,97}^ to 36/2 score. 
The Tartans won 13 of the IS 
events, losing only the century 
and the, high'. jump. In addition 
to winning the two hurdle races, 
Tom Coulter ran his first collegi
ate 220 yard dash and in winning, 
set a new track rccord of 22.2, 
Jack Croissant placed second to 
Tom in this event but W. & J. 
claimed a lane foul and the protest 
was allowed. Croissant also took 
second in the 100. Murray Armentro.ut took second individual honors 
a result of, firsts in the shot 
and' hammer.
Shorey Allan and "General 
Grant Ramsay handled the mile' 
run proficiently, Allan winning in 
4:46. Emil Stankej* won his first 
half-mile of the season, with 
Bobbie Schell filling in the second 
place gap. Jess Price ran a beautiful 
two-mile race, .to win iii 10:15.3. 
Jess has been Steadily lowering his 
time in this event and ,Saturday's 
run was the fastast of his career. 
In the 440, Lewis Ewing put on 
a great finish to win in 53.8. Canplaced second to Ewingi
Ray Barger and Ralph Merten 
tied for first in the pole vault. 
Ralph also took 'second in the 
high jump .and third in the broad 
jump. Brcwdr placed second to Johns 
in the broad jump and lied .for third 
in the high jump. Ed Etentz copped 
the discus throw and placed third to 
Brindel in the javelin. Carl Forsman was second in the discus.
Golfers Hold First 
Practice Saturday
The first official tryouts 
for golf enthusiasts of Car
negie will get under way next 
Saturday morning, May 14, 
.at the Pittsburgh Field Club. 
 All students who have regis
tered at the Athletic Office 
and any additional players 
Should report ready to play 
, at 10 a. m.
A preliminary survey of 
the campus revealed about 20 
golfers with an average score 
of 80. This is a fairly good 
beginning and the possibility 
' of a golf team -with a match 
or two within the next few 
weeks will be serio.usly con
sidered after Saturdays prac
tice.
Plebes Meet Shadyside
' The Plebc track team takes
their annual trek to Shadyside
Academy this Friday to meet the 
prepstcrs in a dual engagement:
Last year, an overconfident fresh
man outfit was fortunate enough 
to win by four points, so this 
years meet should prove to be
very close and interesting. The 
schoolboys can always be counted 
upon to have one or two stars 
and enough athletes . of average 
ability to make things troublesome 
for Carnegie.
Things did-not fare so well with 
the Plebes last year and Kiski 
went home with a 67 to 50 track 
victory. Perino, Skibo dash star, 
was the victim of a miserable start 
in the "century, Taut proved that 
he was the best sprinterby easily 
winning the 220. Burke had little 
trouble taking the 880 and Hoff
man and Blair placed first and 
second respectively in the  mile 
run.
Hoffman of Kiski pulled up 
third to nose out Davis and 
of Tech in the. "quarter. Kiski 
also took the'"first two 
both hurdle events. . Dc 
the high jump and' placed 
to Fritz'-, and Allen in the pole 
vault. Brown, .Piakowski and Ewalt 
scored: thirds in the shot, discus 
and javpiilin respectively.

 requirements for telephone service vary. 
So, to meet special conditions, Bell System 
men custom-fit the service to the subscriber.
They worked out a telephone conference 
plan for a large manufacturer. Every Friday, 
at specified times, cach district manager calls 
the home office, where telephone facilities are
so arranged that the chief sales executives are 
on the line simultaneously. Problems are dis
cussed, decisions given. In minutes, the ex
ecutives cover the country. This plan lowered 
selling costs, raised efficiency, helped the user 
to increase profits 31% in a years time.
By making the telephone more useful, 
Bell System men contribute to the success

NETMEN PLAY HERE WED. AND SAT.
The varsity tennis team is in for 
a tough period this week, meeting 
three strong teams. Yesterday they 
took on Pitt ov,er on the hill, 
while tomorrow they meet Grove City 
on the home courts. On Satur
day Temple sends up a strong 
team from Philadelphia which so 
far has made a strong rccord. 
However, the tennis team is going 
to try to keep the athletic slate 
against the Owls cleat* from de
feats and they are going to have 
their hands full in doing it. On 
Monday, May 16, the Tartans play 
host 'to the Panther courtmen and 
play off the final inter-city match.
The Plebes have all their matches 
next week in foreign territory. 
Wednesday they meet Shadyside atShadysfde, while on Friday they 
journey up to Kiski to take on 
the prep school boys there. On 
Monday, while the Varsity is en
tertaining the Pitt varsity here, 
the Plebes go over to the other 
side of Oakland and meet the 
Panther yearlings. It is a tough 
weeks schedule for both varsity 
and freshmen and they will have 
to be, in top shape to win a majority of the matches.
The Carnegie Tech tennis team 
continued its victorious march to
ward an* undefeated season by win
ning two matches in as many 
starts. So far,, the courtmen, have 
not tasted defeat and the chances 
of keeping their slate clean are 
good, that is, if they were able to 
defeat Pitt yesterday. The Plebc 
team is also making a good rccord 
in spite of the fact that'they suf
fered a defeat at the hands of Mt. 
Lebanon ,Iiigh after they have 
trimmed the Duquesnc Frosh.
On Wednesday the varsity wicldThe Fuller Brush Company has a limited number of openings in excellent territories, for college men this summer. The" college will gladly give you furinformation.

On the same afternoon the

arc being offered by the ColgatcPalmolivc-Pcct Company, in connect 
tion with their monthly shaving cream 
contest. They arc giving a total of 
$25,000 in cash. Each month two

which has been printed in the last 
few issues of the Plaid.

be made at the Registrar's Office at 
once for the details so that no time 
will be lost from classes. These 
courses are condensed so much that 
one absence works a handicap and 
requires additional work to become 
caught up in the assignments.
Courscs scheduled in the Supple

schedule and also of taking subjects 
which would be impossible to obtain 
at any other time.

better come anyway and secure 
one at the door. The price of 
the tickets is one dollar per couple.

its the Inter-Night Dancc, and I 
am going to be there, as I have 
bought my ticket. I couldnt let

without being present. You know, 
I enjoyed all the dances held by

Settle the Rushing Rules Properly
CARNEGIE STUDENTS ordinarily credited with a 
knowledge of the "scientific method of thinking are coun
tenancing a situation in their fraternity organization that is 
a sad counterpart, to their education. The existing rushing 
rules need radical revision. Throughout the year the Tar
tan, and a number of other interested sources, have sug
gested and advocated certain changes, hoping to eliminate 
a number of the commonly accepted faults of the regula
tions. It is now almost the end of school and the rules 
retain their inherent faults and give little promise of cor
rection. '
THE INTHRFRATERNITYf COUNCIL has prepared 
several suggested changes to the rushing rules. They have 
passed these regulations in their assembly, and now .complacently await the approval of the Faculty Executive 
Board. A highly complicated system has been outlined, 
where the week following first semester registration is the 
initial or "contact period. Then with the second week 
comes limited rushing, followed' in a week by concentrated,- 
unlimited rushing. They propose to pledge men, through the 
dean's office, using the closed formal bid. This plan will 
meet with little favor among the faculty board mainly on 
the, basis that it would interfere too .soon with the new 
freshmen. As soon as word returns to the Council as to 
what action, was taken on their petition, they, will either 
hitve aii alternative program ready or else fall back upon the 
discredited program;-now existing. *
THE IEAN SUBMITTED by Council is far from an 
ideal solution to the problem. Under the proposal the at
titude between, the rushees and the fraternities is hardly 
changed. The burden of the work of pledging to a frater
nity should be ,011 the rushec and this can never be in any 
concentrated rushing program. The proposed system, in
volving a great many la>ys, in fact, too many for effective 
enforcement, will abet the competition among houses in 
securing meetings with the new men. The same situation 
will prevail where each fraternity will go to the expense 
and trouble, of staging entertainment, and then have to 
struggle for dates with freshmen. The time involved is 
too long to ask any group of fraternity members to share 
in.continuous rushing, ill: is doubtless true that the wild 
scramble marking the opening of rushingg season in the 
past, may be avoided by having the season open on a Mon
day morning rather than on a holiday. - Also the method 
of giving out bids should eliminate the possibility of high 
pressure talk swaying the judgment of the rushees. The 
plan has merits, that is sure, but it certainly does not \i-(jprcsent the desired and necessary changes that are inherent 
in the prevailing and the proposed systems.
THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY concerned with secur
ing pledges have displayed their typical mild disinterest. Al
though willing to admit the need for action, no display of 
initiative from within the group has been noticeable. Even 
on the Intcrfratcrnity Council, where the, problem-should rank 
foremost at'the present, there has been an exceptional lack of 
spirit. The attitude of resignation, because of the belief 
that all radical changes will be blocked by the administra-' 
tion, is not to be xpected from any persons having the 
courage of their convictions. And within the fraternities, 
where talk and theories flow freely, the typical group which 
lives from meeting to meeting without any constructive 
thought or action of their own cannot be depended upon to 
resurrect the cause.
THE EXECUTIVE BOARD unofficially opposes be
ginning a rushing season earlier than the period of midsemester exams. This concern might be well founded in 
view of the amount of time lost from school in the present 
highly concentrated rushing system. In case a different 
program was advanced this factor need not remain of such 
prime importance. A proposal for withholding rushing 
until the sophomore year a man is in school has been sug
gested by this group. Why should such very, definite 
attempts be made to shield new men as long as possible 
from the benefits of a fraternity, when the most good a 
fraternity can do is in helping the new freshmen.
THE DESIRABLE CHANGES in the rushing rules 
center about securing a more simplified, organized program,
' similar to the successful program in use by (he sororities at 
our own scljool. Starting at the conclusion of the first 
month of school Carnegie could include a rushing program 
of at least one month where evc^ry fraternity was permitted 
one dance and a limited number of smokers. These events 
would be scheduled k.- different nights to prevent more 
than two or three groups competing for the rushees. With 
no off campus functions, and rushees in the chapter houses 
only for the several smokers of the month there would be 
no opportunity for any house to make rushing season a 
highly concentrated, expensive custom. It could develop 
into a highly constructive, sane, period for both parties to 
become acquainted. Thenconclude with the formal pre
sentation of bids from the deans office, and our rushing 
program might approach the desirable. The most success
ful programs discovered in other schools follow the same 
general idea.
The opportunity presents itself for the Interfraternitv 
Council . tof discard its lethargic attitude and present to the 
Executive Board a proposal with such evident benefits that 
it cannot honestly be refused. The time is very limited; 
the cause has b^een thoroughly studied; let us see some 
far-seeing and constructive action taken to resurrect our 
rushing system from its most unnatural plight.
FROM THE FENCE
All Aboard!Promptly at onc-half hour after sailing time, 
last Friday night, the good ship George Washington loaded lo the scuppers, shoved' oft for a; sail down the beautiful Ohio. The ships crcw pulled an awful faux pas by having the, green navigationlight 011 the port side and the red light 011 thesta'board. The first ship that parsed notified them of their breach of etiquette and. alterations were quickly made. ... As advertised the top deck was unlighted and very popular. 
That left more room on the dance floor. . . . Some young lady hopped in among the orchestra to warble a bit. Upon hop-, ping out again she miscalculated the coefficient of friction of the waxed floor mdc an imperfect three point landing. . . . We thought that maybe with net hose and all that bare legs would not be back this season but they made their debut at the boat dance. . . . Most of the P. & D. department and many fraternity men were present. . . ..The affair was a howling success except that no one 
got wet. . . .* * * *
Long Live the Queen! v
Hail to Mary, Queen of Scots! And to Nan and Rosaline, Maids of Honor! Looks like the Secretarais and Library School rather forged ahed.... Now that we have a Carnival Queen we must have a Cahiival. This ultra modCrnc coronation is going to be quite different and rather elegant. Being executed in the Gym the architects wont beable to lower alarm clocks and water. . . Nice having the sweepstakes late in the morning so we can both get some sleep and get to sec the races. . . .And Heyday, some fun! Everybody join in andhave a grand time. . . . Boy, some of the costumes youll see at the Costume Ball. It will be the best yet. No tearing back and forth from Union to Gym. . . . Tap Exercises to be held in the Sylvan Theater where more things', should be held than are. . . . Then the Musical Revue (a guaranteed $4.40 attraction) something new and different. . . . Then as taps a very appropriate Closing Ceremony in the Sylvan Theater. Then on carnival till

Practice Exams
Just to get the Seniors in the mood for exams they were plagued with a conglomeration of quizes for three mornings last week. To raise the standard of the Engineers, Mary McKeon, Ruth Brooks and Edith Turner took the exams with the'boys. If the Culture Exams is to be a measure of culture the Engineers might as wellhave conceded at first that they totally lacked this so-called culturc. On top of the exams the Seniors awoke to the fact that several departments did not recognize the interruption of the exams and -work was due anyhow. . . .* * * *
Campus Shots
Fritz and His Army waging war on the dandelions. Boy, do they weed them out! ... A lone gray squirrel visited the campus last Wednesday morning. Jt trailed Gert Zenk back of Art School for a bit and then struck off for the tall timber.... 
Ice cream cones are the campus favorite these days. . . . Thc'Fencc is again a favorite perch.... Fraternity freshmen merrily goiijg about their 
duties cleaning up the lawns, etc. . . . The Forbes lasses have the walls of their smoking roomcovered with silhouettes of themselves. Quite novel. ... .* * * *
Outdoors on the Campus
Outdoor activity has been enjoyably accelerated by the coming of this enticing weather. On any typical day. strolling about the campus one can find squads of scintillating co-eds, cant-lcave-thc-women-alone < engineers, a large janitorial forcesupervised by the barks of Fritz, dagos picking dandelions, and a goodly number of dogs and mongrels. And Orb in. himself taking* a short-cut across the tender grass! Out on the cut the physical education girls arc playing some kind of ball never heard of the game they play. First they kick the ball, then they throw it, then they fall 
over it, all of this intermingled with screams of feminine desperation.* * * *
Pitt Frolics
Pitt just concluded their Carnival so have nothing to look forward to but exams. . . . The highlight of the Sports Dance was the murder, in cold blood, of a crooner who was crooning the Maine Stein Song. It was a little more than too much for one of llic lads dancing who pulled a gat and let the songbird have two slugs. Making the greatest scoop in newspaper history the Pitt Weekly had an Extry on sale in ten seconds flat after the shooting. A number of Tech girls 
were at the d a.n c c, among them our Queen.... A super, thrilling sweepstakes classic was the Friday headliner with tap day exercises. . . . The climax of the Carjiival was a very successful Inter-fraternity Migratory dancing which was attended by several Tech girls and Lib Lewis. . . . Hope the weatherman gives as good weather for our Carnival as Pitt had last week-end. .... .

A Communication
EDITOR, THE TARTAN:
. On behalf of Mrs. Mott, as well 
as for myself, I wish to extend, 
through the Tartan, our sincere 
appreciation and hearty thanks for 
the beautiful roses which Mrs. Mott has received from faculty, students 
and alumni.
1 find it difficult to express ade
quately the feeling aroused by the 
many kind tributes paid to my 
associates and to me at the student 
Assembly 011 Tuesday last. In a 
sense, nothing can intensify my in
terest and regard^ for the faculty, 
students and alumni which 23 years 
of close association have built up; 
nevertheless, one would be indeed 
indifferent were lie not gratified 
and encouraged by the friendly ex
pressions of esteem, voiced by Mr. 
Porter, Dr. James, Mr. Blcnko and 
yourself. v
I 1 shall enjoy the weekly visits* 
of the Tartan and thank the staff 
for making possible this close as
sociation.
To the students of Carnegie, in
dividually and collectively, my sin
cere admiration and good . wishes 
for a successful future!..
Sincerely vours, 
.WILLIAM E. MOTT.,

THE result of exhaustive wind-tunnel tests of 
conventional trolley car models revealed that 
at speeds of 70 and 80 miles per hour, 70 per 
cent of the total power was consumed in over
coming air resistance. Streamlining saves approxi
mately 20 per cent of the power.
When the Philadelphia and Western Railway 
Company decided to replace its cars with faster 
and more efficient equipment, it chose ''electric 
bullets77new streamlined cars  each powered 
by 4 G-E 100-hp. motors. The cars, constructed 
pf aluminum alloy, with tapered noses and tails, 
are much lighter in weight and capable of greater 
operating efficiency.
In developing transportation apparatus, college-trained General' 
Electric engineers have conducted extensive tests to improve oper-( 
ating conditions. On land, on sea, and in the air, to-days equipment 
is safer, swifter, more dependable, and more comfortable.
