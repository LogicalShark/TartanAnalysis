FIRST (LASSES HELD IN INDUSTRY BIDO.
Since the beginning of the school, 
many customs have sprung up in M. 
M. C. S. that are unique and interest
ing. Beginning with the Plebe year, 
aside from the customary wearing 
of the green, every year the Faculty 
and Senior Class give a reception to 
Plebes, in order to make them feel 
more at home in their new surround
ings and to create an opportunity to 
become better acquainted. This usu
ally marks the first social event of 
the school year. Then, at the first 
Assembly occurring in the fall of the 
new term, it has always been the cus
tom for the Seniors to escort the 
Plebes into the Assembly Hall. The 
line is lead by the president of the 
Senior Class.
It has been customary since 1914 
for each class in their Junior year 
to have a ring which may be worn 
only by members of that particular 
class adopting the design. In 1915 
an Alumni ring and pin were adopted 
which may be worn only by girls hav
ing graduated from the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School.
Then there are the annual social 
events as the Junior Prom, Senior 
Ball, and Pan Hellenic Dance, which 
are looked forward to, each year, with 
increased enthusiasm and met with 
elaborate and careful plans.
Besides) the common courtesies due 
Seniors from underclasmen, Seniors 
are given preference in the lunch 
room, on the stairs, and are given a

The Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School was opened in the winter of 
1906-07 in quarters temporarily ar
ranged for in the building of the 
School of Applied Industries, and 
moved into its own building in the 
autumn of 1907. The idea in founding 
this School seems to have been to 
devise a new form of education for 
women, modeled on none of the ex
isting types of school or college 
something at once conservative and 
modern, holding fast on the one hand 
to the classic ideal for womanhood 
embodied in the inscription on the en
trance court, while on the other hand 
faring forth upon an unexplored sea 
of experiment in both methods and 
subject matter of teaching. The first 
Dean, Miss Anna Beckwith Smith, 
now Mrs. Harry Hart, during her 
four years of office, carried on this 
constructive work of practical edu
cational research to a point where she 
began to send forth graduates of the 
School to take many of the larger 
tasks that fall to women. The sound
ness of the theories on which she and 
her colleagues worked is demon
strated bv the genuine success that 
these graduates have made, whether 
as married women in their model 
homes, or as workers along other 
lines, educational, or business, or ex
ecutive. From the first, the alumnae 
of the School have nearly all followed 
some remunerative career on leaving 
the School, and the idea of a noble 
economic independence, not incom
patible with domesticity, seems to be 
firmly fixed or>e of our traditions.
M. M. C S. ALUMNAE STRONGLY ORGANIZED
Marriage may interrupt the immedi
ate following of a salaried occupa
tion; but, if the alumnae has really 
learned the lessons of her Alma Ma
ter, it interrupts rather the salary 
than the occupation, though broaden
ing and modifying that occupation.
The second Dean of the School, 
Miss Clara Linforth West, carried it 
through a period of rapid and some
what revolutionary transition. To
ward the end of her three years of of
fice, the course of study was length
ened from three to four years, and 
it was thus possible to justify the 
granting of degrees. After Miss 
Wests resignation in 1912, the School 
was under Director Hamerschlags
immediate control for a year, and in 
1913 the present Dean was appointed.
Since its opening, 1423 students
have been registered in the Day
School, and 1476 in the Night School. 
Diplomas were given to 141 in the old 
three-year course, 196 have received 
Night School certificates, and 103 
have received the degree of Bachelor 
of Science. Among the faculty, there
have been many changes. Mrs. Philput, Miss Stoner, and Mr. Esquerre 
have remained with the organization 
since its early days. Miss Lyon is 
the Senior Head of Department, hav
ing held that position ever since the 
present departmental system was be
gun in 1912. In addition to the orig
inal special lines of study, represented 
pt present by the departments of 
Household Economics, Costume Eco
nomics, and Secretarial Studies, we

Association Does Excellent Work 
For School. Scholarship Given 
Each Year.
The Alumnae Association of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
began with the first graduating class 
in 1909 which consisted of 43 mem
bers. Miss Bess Sheets, now Mrs. 
Fred Gaston, was the first president 
of the Association and served for two 
years. Under her very able adminis
tration the Alumnae developed and 
grew. During the first three years, 
the Association had a chapter in the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
Guild of Workers and each year it 
held a Christmas Sale, the proceeds 
of which went toward establishing a 
scholarship fundthe scholarship of 
$50 to go to a struggling Senior in 
good standing who would otherwise 
be unable to finish her course. In 
1912, the annual Sale was discon
tinued, but each year since some ben
efit has been given early in the year 
for this fund which now became a 
permanent institution. Up to this 
time, the Association has been unable 
to give more than one scholarship a 
year but it hopes in the very near fu
ture to increase the amount of the 
scholarship and if possible to help two 
students each year.
The object of the Association is to 
further the interests of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School and to pro
mote social intercourse and fellow
ship among the members. An annual 
business meeting is held in June on 
Commencement Day at which reports 
of the committees are read, old and

M. M. C. S. DORMITORIES 
ACCOMMODATE STUDENTS
House Rules Formulated By Means 
Of Student Government.
When the Womans School was op
ened in 1907, a small house was rent
ed and furnished to provide a home 
for out of town students, but there 
seemed little or no need for it at 
that time and the house was closed 
at the end of that year.
Five years later the increasing num
ber of out-of-town students and the 
limited and unsatisfactory accommo
dations in the city led to the re-es
tablishment of a home for the women. 
The experiment was started in the 
house on the corner of Neville and 
Wallingford streets, the family con
sisting of seventeen students, Miss 
Adam as stewardness, Miss Lyon as 
faculty chaperon, with Ann and 
Mary as faitful helpers.
Student government was estab
lished from the beginning, the stu
dents formulating their own house 
rules, with a president and floor proc
tors as the governing body. The 
chaperon to be called upon for special 
privileges only, or in emergency cases. 
The house soon proved its value and 
the following spring plans were made 
for a much larger dormitory. The 
present house at 325 Morewood was 
secured and the owner built to meet 
the needs of the school at that time. 
Miss Collingwood of the Household 
Economics Department came that fall 
to take charge of the house and is 
still the efficient and much beloved 
chaperon of this group of students.
The following year the demand for 
dormitory accommodations exceeded 
the limits of this house, and again 
our Director devoted his time to 
house hunting, securing the Fifth 
Avenue house as a home for Design 
nnrl M M. C. S. students combined. 
Miss Ingersoll and Miss Struthers 
plumed the chaperonage of this 
v./->iice together for the first semester, 
Miss Struthers having full charge duri*r<r the second semester.
This last fall the house adjoining 
t^e Morewood dormitory was secur
ed to provide for the rapidly growing 
family and this was called the Annex. 
Miss Adam left the dormitories to 
nter Mr. Orbins office as buyer for 
.11 dormitories and lunchrooms and 
a housekeeper was provided for each 
dormitory. Miss Seigel for the More
wood house and Mrs. Truesdall for 
tVe Fifth avenue house, with Miss 
Marvin of the Secretarial Depart
ment as faculty chaperon of the DenVn dormitory.
This year there were 83 students 
living in the three houses, 50 in the 
Morewood houses and 33 in the De
sign School house on Fifth avenue.

ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION 
FOUNDED IN 1913-1914
Varsity Basketball Team. Plaid C 
Used as Emblem of Merit.
The many changes in Margaret 
Morrison during the past few years 
have caused its evolution from a 
school to a college. Great leaps were 
made in the curriculum, and parallel 
with these should be advances in our 
activities. The Margaret Morrison 
girl was only normal in wishing to 
do something with athletics.
There had always been a fair per
centage of students that enjoyed the 
recreational value of athletics. As 
we grew in age and numbers we got 
a different type of girl and soon every 
one began to realize that we needed 
to organize if we wanted to do any
thing as students for the athletics in 
Margaret Morrison.
Following the mid-year exams of 
the year 1913-14, after much consulta
tion with Miss Stoner and Dean 
Breed, a group of fifty girls met in 
the assembly hall to organize an Ath
letic Association. Officers were elect
ed, a constitution was drawn up, and 
plans made for real work.
In the first great burst of enthusi
asm a very successful tennis tourna
ment was conducted. For the first 
time a sweater bearing a M. M. C. S. 
monogram was given to a winner of 
an athletic sport in our school. The 
distinguished girl was Katherine Dermit, of the Class of 1914.
The next fall, during registration, 
and the first few days of school, sixty 
students joined the Association. It 
was necessary to get a strong mem
bership if it was to be alive at all, 
since we were denied any financial 
assistance from the student activities 
fund. This discouragement served 
more as a stimulus than a stumbling 
block. The girls who wanted an as
sociation were willing to work and 
were not to be defeated by any ruling 
of money.
On Monday afternoon, October 
5/ffh. 1914. the Athletic Association 
held a rally in the gymnasium for all 
the girls in the school. Every ef
fort was put forth for a good time. 
There was dancing, games and mu
sic. Booklets containing school 
songs and cheers were given every 
student for her own use.
The next contribution the associa
tion made to the school was the seContinued on Page 9
DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL 
EDUCATION
Great Aid To Students. Many Sports 
Organized. Faculty Basketball 
Team.
The gymnasium of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School was equip
ped by the first instructor Elizabeth 
R. Stoner, during the summer of 
1907. The number of students who 
attended classes and were examined 
that fall was one hundred and thirtyseven.
For four years Miss Stoner carried 
the work alone teaching gymnastics, 
athletics and dancing. The examin
ing physician was Dr. Elizabeth Mar
lin, 1908-1910.
In 1909-T0 a pianist, Miss Lena 
Orton was added to the staff.
From 1911 to 1914, Miss Catherine 
Eastman, a graduate of the Hygiene 
department of Wellesley College as
sisted Miss Stoner, who had gradu
ated from the Boston Normal School 
of Gymnastics. During 1911-12, 1912- 
13, Dr. Ada Watson was the examin
ing physician and 1913-14, Dr. Alice 
Rhodes. During 1914 to 1916, Miss 
Ruth Mason of Wellesley assisted 
Miss Stoner and Dr. Esther Blair is 
the examining physician.
In 1913 the course of Physical Edu
cation was raised to the dignity of 
a department with Miss Soal receiv
ing the title of Assistant Professor 
at the head. Miss Eastman as in
structor as assistant and Miss Griffin, 
pianist.
Other pianists have been Miss 
Cahrlotte Steffner and alumnus of 
the school and at the present time 
Miss Lillian Myers.
The department is thoroughly 
equipped with Swedish apparatus, 
shower baths and dressing rooms.
During the winter Basket Ball is 
the only sport but in the spring and 
fall, hockey, archery, throwing the 
discus, broad and high jump, short 
dashes and relay races take the place 
of the more formal gymnastics and 
dnncing.
In 1915-16 a faculty basket ball 
team was organized for the purpose 
of affording a time for recreation for 
the women of the faculty.

THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
ASSOCIATION
Students Make Own Rules and 
Regulations.
The Student Government move
ment was started in the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School in the 
Spring of 1914. In the Fall of 1914, 
the first delegates were sent to the 
national convention at Radcliffe, as 
the M. M. C. S. Student Government 
Association had been admitted to the 
National Student Government Asso
ciation that year. Each year, the 
president of the Student Senate and 
a member of the Junior Class 
(elected) are sent as delegates to the 
convention. This year it was held 
at Western Reserve.
The aim of Student Government is 
to have the rules and regulations by 
which the student body lives, made 
by themselves. Through the Senate, 
the rules are made, and offenders are 
punished by this body. The punish
ments are recommended by the Sen
ate, and the Dean passes on them.
The Student Senate is composed of 
a president, vice president, treasurer, 
and secretary, elected by the student 
body, and a Junior, Sophomore, and 
Plebe representative. The president 
is always a Senior. New members 
are elected every year.
Weekly meetings are held, when 
any student may bring complaints or 
questions to be decided.
There are yearly dues which are 
paid by each student at the beginning 
of the school year.
M. M. C. S. GUILD.
The Guild of Margaret Morrison is 
a charitable organization and has as 
its aim the betterment of mankind. 
Nobody knows exactly when it was 
started but from the first it has been 
associated closely with the history of 
our school. It has done excellent 
work. Help has been given to many 
agencies, homes and organizations of 
Pittsburgh. For many years Kings
ley House has received financial aid, 
while practical service in the nature 
of night gowns for the Pittsburgh 
Home for Babies has also been ren
dered. This year socks were given 
to Major Days soldiers in Canada, 
either made by the girls themselves 
or donated through the purchase of 
ready-to-wear ones. Nearly every 
girl in the school belongs to the Guild, 
and takes an active part in its work, 
which is just as it should be, as the 
cause is a worthy one.
THE DRAMATIC CLUB.
From the beginning, the Dramatic 
Club of Margaret Morrison has al
ways accomplished a lot. As in the 
case of the Guild, its early history is 
doubtful, except for the fact that every 
,rear several plays have been given 
bv its members. Many notable and 
interesting productions have been 
staged, chief of which are Lady Gregings plays, Dickens Christmas Carol, 
Lndermanns Far Away Princess, 
and others.

St. Pat.s Day will remain long in 
the memory of those boys and girls 
who attended the initial dance of the 
Mechanics Club held last Friday 
night in the Union Building. About 
thirty couples graced the hall which 
was very tastefully decorated in keep
ing with the occasion. At the door, 
all were met by Eddie Hedlund who 
was the power behind the throne in 
furnishing the splendid punch and 
refreshments. Numerous novelties 
were prepared by the committee in 
the way of typical Irish dances, horn
pipes, sword-dances, etc. An exhi
bition of real old gaelic dancing was 
given by two exponents expressly 
imported for the occasion. The even
ing was spent very pleasantly and 
went all too quickly. Another dance 
will end the clubs activities this 
school year.

At a meeting of the sororities it was

make it a success. The date chosen 
is Friday, March 24th; the place, the

Hockey Team Breaks Pitts Winning 
Streak.
Tuesday night March 14th, Pitt 
was defeated by Tech at the Duquesne: 
Gardens by a score of 2-1. The gam: 
was fast and marked by the lack oi 
penalties, not a single player of either 
side being put off the ice for rough 
work.
Within 2 minutes after the play had 
started, Davis took the puck down 
the ice and scored N*itli a long weli! 
directed shot to the corner of the 
net. The play then seesawed back 
and forth until near the end of the 
haif McMurray shot a goal from 
scrimmage near the Tech goal. The 
play then settled down being divided 
evenly so that the half ended with 
the score a tie at 1 all.
In the second half Tech started 
off with a rush and carried the play 
into the Pitt territory, until Julian 
received the puck behind his own goal 
and skated through the entire Pitt 
team down to the net. McClellan 
stopped the shot but Cooke drove it 
in on the rebound for the second 
score!. The rest of the period the 
puck travelled up and down the ice 
with the play well divided. During 
this time Julian gave some final ex
hibition of hockey by taking the disk 
through the Pitt team time after 
time.
McMurray played best for Pitt 
making several good shots while MeCellan also played well especially in 
breaking down the shots and rushes 
made by Julian. Kelly and McEllroy 
played well.
While the whole Tech team played 
well Cooke; Julian and Evans lead 
the team with fine display of hockey.

Last Saturday at 2:30 P. M. the 
first base ball practice was held in 
the gymnasium, with a squad of ap
proximately fifteen men, all battery 
candidates, the entire squad not hav

sisted chiefly of putting over a few 
easy ones and more or less getting 
used to the feeling of a base ball. It 
only lasted about an hour. The bat
tery men will practice for a half hour 
or so every afternoon this week and 
should be in fairly good trim by the 
time that the entire squad is called 
out. This, by the way will be next

EXCITING TALE OF KID
NAPPERS.
Green Captured by Plebes, But 
Proves Too Smart for Captors.
He was walking along Forbes street 
near Morewood avenue, repeating his 
speech for the next night at the Soph, 
banquet. Thats the way presidents 
and toastmasters have to do, you 
know. Soon a band of Plebes, woe 
to them, seized Green and tying his 
arms behind him, jammed him into 
a taxi. No! they didnt let him go 
alone, as many as could get into the 
gas wagon accompanied him, and off 
they rodeGreen not knowing where. 
What he may have said to his cap
tors we who know Ed so well can 
closely guess; but this is a public 
journal and its editors have precise 
instructions to print only news.
The taxi stopped, they handed 
Green out and Point Breeze looked 
a long way from home to Ed., for 
he was to play basketball that even
ing and could not escape easily.
The Plebes had the escapade well 
planned and locked Green in a bed
room of one of the residences in that 
section. Where theres a will theres 
a way, and before long, after sev
eral hours of intrigue, Green dropped 
out of the window to the roof below 
and hurried to the Soph, rendezvous 
at 23 Mawhinney street. Green had 
help, able help to be sure, for Jake 
Adams stood by him all the while and 
walked the hot sands at his side. 
Vernon, a Captive Also, Makes 
Getaway.
Plebes wili be Plebes, regardless 
of the future consequences. Bob, 
we all call him Bob, Vernon knew 
of Greens capture the day before, but 
had no idea that he would be black 
listed by the Plebes also. They us
ually skip Tartan representatives 
either out of choice or pityat any 
rate, Bob had no intimation of his 
capture. They used the same tactics 
of capture as they had used the dav 
before with Greene and before Bob 
had more than stepped onto Forbes 
street he was seized, and hustled off 
in a taxi. They stopped at Dithridge 
street and locked Vernon in a room 
there. Its a hard matter to break 
loose when ones arms and legs are 
roped tightly, but Bob, fully equal to 
the circumstances, was soon loose and 
freethen captured again. What a 
pity a movie man wasnt on the 
scene. Liberty was short though, and 
Vernon next found liimself locked in 
a house on Meyran avenue. Some 
neighbors saw his capture and mis
taking the Plebe joke for actual kid
naping, called the police station. 
Three detectives were soon at the 
house and with drawn guns scattered 
the party. Vernon hurried to the 
banquet, at last a free man.
Plebes be aware; but then A 
Plebes a Plebe for a that.

THE SPECIAL ISSUES
During the next weeks there will 
be four special issues of The Tartan, 
each issue being devoted to one of 
the four schools at Tech. In publish
ing these issues The Tartan is en
deavoring to fill a long felt need of 
the student body. These issues will 
be devoted to historical facts and in
cidents concerning the past history 
of the schools; there will be an at
tempt made to familiarize the student 
body concerning the history and pur
pose of student organizations, vari
ous student activities, and courses of
fered by the various departments.
The following general subjects will 
be covered:
The history, development and pur
pose of each department.
A short historical sketch of various 
student activities.
Interesting cuts concerning each 
school.
Review of Athletics at Tech since 
1905.
Many other items of general inter
est and of a humorous nature will be 
included in these issues.
These issues will be particularly 
valuable inasmuch as they offer to the 
students an opportunity to familiarize 
themselves with the history, develop
ment and present facts concerning not 
only their own school but also all 
other schools of Carnegie Tech.
We trust that our humble efforts 
will meet the approval of the student
body, and that these issues will be 
both helpful and interesting to those 
who may have an interest in Dear 
Old Tech.

Through the unfortunate error we 
neglected to give credit to A. N. Ein
stein for the conception and execution 
of the idea of the victrola at the 
home concert. We were exceedingly 
impressed in the ingenuity and origi
nality displayed both in the idea it
self and the means of earring it out. 
No little labor was entailed by Mr. 
Einstein in carrying through the pro

for his energy.
A FEW INTERESTING FACTS 
CONCERNING M. M. C. S.
In July, 1906, Miss Margaret McConway turned over the first spade 
full of earth for the present M. M. 
C. S. building.
The first Dean of the M. M. C. S. 
was Miss Anna Beckwith Smith.
On November 24, 1908, a number 
of M. M. C. S. girls went around Oak
land and downtown in an auto adver
tising the Tech-W. and J. football 
game to be held Thanksgiving Day, 
by distributing posters, etc. This 
caused considerable favorable com
ment and the Pittsburgh papers 
lauded the spirit of the girls and 
printed photographs of the girls and 
the auto.
The contract for the construction 
of the M. M. C. S. was let July 2, 1906.
At nine oclock, on September 17, 
1906, Director Hammerschlag deliv
ered the opening address to the first 
class of seventy-five students.
One of the members of the first 
graduating class from the Department 
of Secretarial studies is now in China 
in charge of a school that she is try
ing to make into a miniature M. M.
C. S., even to the Womans Preroga
tives (in good Chinese) over the 
front door.
Our founders mother after whom 
M. M. C. S. is named.
HOW M. M. C. S. WAS NAMED.
The first classes were held in the 
Industry Building. At this time one 
of the main duties of the administra
tion seems to have been to separate 
the girls and boys both studying in 
the same building. Separate doors 
and paths were used. Statistics con
cerning the marriages of the alumni 
of M. M. C. S. would lead one to be
lieve that the administration seems to 
have failed in their undertaking.
January 1906, the board of Trustees 
adopted the following resolution, 
Whereas it is eminently fitting that 
the memory of the mother of Pitts
burghs generous benefactor should 
inspire that group of the Carnegie 
Technical schools, which is to be es
pecially devoted to the training of 
the young women in the practical du
ties of life.
Resolved, That this group shall be 
designated the Margaret Carnegie 
School for Women.
A copy of this resolution was sent 
to our founder who suggested that 
the school would better be named 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
to distinguish between his mother and 
daughter.
THE PAN HELLENIC SOCIETY 
OF M. M. C. S.
Aids Sorority Organization. Con
trols Rushing and Pledging 
Rules.
During the school year of 1912-13, 
many of the sororities were formed, 
Theta Sigma being the first. Gene
vieve Cushwa, Theta Sigma, and 
Sara Kerr, Delta Delta, in discussing 
sorority conditions, thought that the 
number of sororities should be lim
ited to four, as the student body did 
not seem large enough to support any 
more. They interested members of 
their own sororities and of two oth
ers, Psi Delta Gamma and Alpha Psi. 
With two members from each soror
ity, the Pan Hellenic committee was 
formed; a constitution was drawn up, 
which included rules for the rushing 
and pledging of Plebes. A rushing 
season of two weeks, during which 
each sorority had a special day upon 
which no other sorority might rush, 
was to be set aside each spring. The 
bids were sent out on specially print
ed cards on a certain date, and the 
answers were required after one week 
of non-intercourse between sorority 
members and Plebes.
The committee was made up of two 
members from each sorority, a Junior 
and a Senior. The Junior to serve

M. M. C. S. Periodical Outgrowth of 
Senior Reading Club.
The ShillingA periodical devoted 
to the literary, scientific, technical 
and social work of the Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie School. With this 
heading the Shilling made its first 
appearance in June, 1914. By way of 
explanation, this issue contained the 
following editorial:
For some time we have felt the 
need of a periodical, in which we 
might express our life within the 
bright and lively walls of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School. The Tar
tan, a weekly paper, devoted to the 
news of the school only, and the This
tle, the regular annual publication, do 
not fill our requirementthat is an 
outlet for literary efforts in English 
and self-expression in our depart
mental and technical work.
With our growth in school spirit, 
in numbers, with a somewhat settled 
schedule, and the coming of our new 
dean, we feel that the psychological 
time has arrived for the launching of 
the Shilling through the columns of 
which we hope to let the friends of 
our school and the students of other 
departments know what we are doing. 
We hope eventually to become an es
tablished, recognized, forceful phase 
of college activity and a means of 
creating and strengthening a distinct 
Carnegie spirit.
The Shilling is the outgrowth of a 
Senior Reading Club, formed for 
purely literary purposes out of the 
Senior Class in poetry. The Club 
started with eight, and later invited 
four Juniors to be broken into editor
ial duties for the coming year: thus 
making a staff of twelve, plus an 
alumnae representative thrown in for 
good measure, and suggesting the 
name as well as the price of the peri
odical.
The present board consists of: 
Editor-in-Chief, Constance Stout, 16. 
Assistant Editor-in-Chief, Katherine 
Wilson, 17.

SCHOLARSHIPS.
There are four scholarships award
ed annually in the school. The 
Alumni Association awards one of 
$50, which was given to Miss Ruth 
Pontius this year. The Pittsburgh 
Sororis awards one of $50, also, which 
was given to Miss Cecelia Hillman. 
The Pittsburgh Female College gives 
a tuition scholarship which was 
awarded to Miss Katherine Miller. 
The Alpha Delta Sorority also gives 
a scholarship, but the award has not 
yet been made this year.

HISTORY OF SORORITIES
Organizations Aid Greatly in Social Life of M. M. C. S.
HISTORY Of DEPARTMENTS
Interesting Developments Traced Thru School's History
THETA SIGMA.
The Theta Sigma Sorority was 
really begun in the Spring of 1909. 
Numerous stealthy meetings were 
held behind locked doors of the laun
dry in the M. M. C. S. building.
The girls who participated in these 
gatherings were chosen from the 
Plebe A. Classthe class which was 
the first to complete the four-year 
course. A list of these charter mem
bers now reads as follows: Mrs.
Katherine Armstrong-Hittner, Mrs. 
Mary BartlesonVail, Mrs. Lina 
ConnellyMcCabe, Miss Genevieve 
Cushwa, Mrs. Laura FlinnSpooner, 
Mi ss Cora Gerwig, Mrs. Lucile Hutch
insonMartin, Mrs. Olive Jenkins 
Walker, Miss Helen Olnhausen, Mrs. 
Edna MoorheadSmith, Mrs. Char
lotte RutherfordHoliday; Mrs.| Ma
bel SeldenMurray, Mrs. Alda 
StrightSplane, Miss Mabel Toudy, 
Mrs. Caroline ShookHinkley.
The sorority held its first organized 
meeting at the home of Mary Bartle
sonVail, in Wilkinsburg, in October 
of 1910, and officers were elected. 
Later the constitution and by-laws 
as drawn up by Mrs. Olive Jenkins 
Walker, and Mrs. Edna Moorhead 
Smith, were adopted.
The first initiation was held at the 
home of Lina ConnellyMcCabe, in 
Sewickley, where the pledges were 
taken in automobiles. Sacred and 
mystic were the rites there perform
ed!
An important annual function of 
Theta Sigma, and one eagerly looked 
forward to by all its members, is the 
picnic held on the beautiful grounds 
of the Macrum homestead in Oakmont. Here alumnae and active 
members gather with their husbands 
and friends and after a picnic dinner 
under the trees, play games on the 
lawn, toast marshmallows, and finally 
finish up with a dance at the Canoe 
Club. In this pleasant manner the 
members say good-bye to begin their 
summer vacation.
Theta Sigma now has an Alumnae 
Chapter numbering some thirty mem
bers; the active chapter has a limit 
of twenty-five.
ALPHA PSI.
The Alpha Psi Sorority was organ
ized November, 1911, with the follow
ing charter members: Jane L. Cald
well, May Francies, Nelle Gabler, 
Laura Green, Clara Jayme, Alice Mar
shall, Otillie Stocke, Mary Williams. 
The sorority was founded as a source 
of help and strength and inspiration 
which those girls felt could be gained 
in no other way, both throughout their 
school life and the life to come. The 
faculty member is Miss Ethel M. 
Ernst.
The following are the active mem
bers of the Sorority: Lila Gilmore,
Ellen Lewis, Imelda Chittendon, Ruth 
Patterson, Helen Wassell, Marion 
Steele, Emily Nicholson, Edna Weyman, Pauline Richmond, Christine 
Fisher.
ALPHA DELTA.
The Alpha Delta Sorority was es
tablished in October, 1912, with eight 
girls -as charter members* Mildred 
Knapp, Irene Pond, Florence Sample, 
Florence Savage Wentworth, Lucille 
Stevens, Inez Rich, Edna Stoebener, 
and Carmen Leopold.
The membership has grown to 
twenty girls whose chief aim is to 
do good. Each year at the Christ
mas season, baskets of toys are sent 
to homes where otherwise Christmas 
cheer would be lacking.
The good times the girls have are 
not to be omitted. Each year in May, 
Alpha Delta holds a dance to which 
they invite their friends. Another 
annual occasion is the Commence
ment luncheon, usually held at the 
Fort Pitt of the Schenley Hotel. Be
sides this each year brings its variety 
of good times.
This year, each girl, by some spe
cial effort of her own, has earned 
some money, the total amount of 
which is to be awarded in June, as a 
scholarship to an incoming Junior or 
Senior in Margaret Morrison, by Dean 
Breed.
DELTA DELTA.
The Delta Delta Sorority was start
ed in the winter of 1911. Sarah Kerr, 
Mildred McCuIIagh, Sarah Isabel 
Haag, Mary Charnley, Louise Nel
son, Elizabeth Lowen, and Dorothy 
Walker are the charter members. For 
two years Miss Mary McKinzie was 
the faculty member.
The present members are Lydia 
Bates, Margurite Menges, Bernice 
Thompson, Carrie Freese, Florence 
Bechtel, Elizabeth Mason, Florence 
Swartwout, Marjorie Carmichael, 
Christine Cameron, Katherine Haag, 
Francis Willis, Agnes Kiser, Ethel 
Weaver.
ALPHA SIGMA PI.
The Alpha Sigma Pi sorority was 
founded in 1912, the constitution and 
by-laws being adopted November 8, 
of that year by seven charter members 
who were as follows: Miss Millicent
Leech, Miss Mary Loomis, Miss Dor
othy Skinner, Miss Lorna Williams, 
Miss Jennie Montgomery, Miss Cor
nelia Eberle, Miss Ruth Jones.
It was desired that an organization 
be formed which would promote bet
ter fellowship and truer friendship 
among the girls, and with a common 
aim and purpose much could be ac
complished towards the achievement 
of their desires.
The active members are: Miss Ma
bel E. Dixon (faculty member); Miss 
Lorna Williams, Miss Hazel Thomas, 
Miss Mary Loomis, Miss Nellie

HOUSEHOLD ECONOMICS DE
PARTMENT.
This Department began its work 
some ten years ago in one corner of 
the Industries Building, under the 
name of Household Arts, and in 
charge of Mr. Sharp. Being a chef, 
his equipment was chosen for hotel 
use, and many funny stories are told 
by the first year girls of their experi
ences in learning to make some forty 
kinds of soups, a la hotel. A strike 
ended the soup course, drastic means 
on the part of young students, but 
proving effectual.
The original purpose of the Depart
ment was simply to offer a well 
rounded course in home-making, and 
was planned for three years, with only 
two years of high school preparation. 
The Senior year offered departmen
tal specialization at that time, but 
no normal training was provided for 
until five years ago. The demand for 
teachers of Domestic Science was so 
great that a teachers training course 
became a necessity to fit our gradu
ates for their work. Four 'years ago 
our entrance requirement was ad
vanced to high school graduation and 
a four-year B. S. degree course was 
offered, which specialization in 
Household Economics, a Teachers 
course, Dietitians or Industrial Man
agement. At the same time the name 
was changed to Household Econom
ics, as being a more specific name 
than Household Arts for our wo/k. 
Last year the Institutional Manage
ment Department was re-established 
a beginning in this work having 
been made by Miss Bradt, five years 
ago, but the course was discontinued 
on her resignation. The increased 
demand from hospitals and institu
tions for all kinds of trained women 
made it necessary to offer specialized 
courses for this work.
The equipment today compares fa
vorably with that of any department 
in the countryconsisting of two 
large kitchens, one experimental 
kitchen, one research kitchen, a 
housekeeping apartment, class room 
and offices, and practice work given 
in the school lunch room.
From twelve to twenty students 
have graduated from the Department 
each year, making a total list of about 
125 in all. Some twenty-five of these 
are now making practical use of their 
home making course, while the oth
ers are successfully filling positions 
as teachers of Domestic Science, as 
hospital dietitians, or lunch room 
managers.
commitee had discovered that this 
city afforded few facilities for train
ing young women for any except sec
ondary positions in those lines. This 
was not intended to interfere in any 
way with the home making ideal 
of the school, but to satisfy the de
mand that girls should be prepared 
to be self supporting in the period 
after school and before they estab
lished homes of their own.
When the opening of the school 
was announced in 1906, there were 
offered day courses for the training 
of record and filing experts, secre
taries, and stenographers. At the 
same time announcement was made 
of night courses in office work and 
bookkeeping, stenography, and ac
countancy.
The following year, the course was 
called Secretarial and began to show 
the form on which the present plan 
was based, although the catalogue of 
that year made very meagre state
ment in regard to the contents of the 
courses. There were two instruct
ors in the Department, one for book
keeping and one for stenography, Mr. 
Wood and Mr. Barnett, respectively.
In the year 10-ll, there were 19 
seniors in this Department, that be
ing the largest number in a graduat
ing class before or since that time. 
In the year 11-12, the catalogue 
listed this as the Department of Of
fice Economy. In June, 1913, the first 
class to receive the degree of Bache
lor of Science in Secretarial studies 
was graduated with three members, 
and in 1914, the first certificates to 
teach high school Commercial studies 
were granted.
In addition to the teachers named 
above, the others in this Department 
have been the Misses Diescher, 
Chandler, Williams, Bray (Mrs. Sill), 
and the present staff, Misses Marvin, 
Sturtevant, Logan, and Holmes.
Economic conditions under which 
we live at present make it necessary 
that many young women shall earn 
their own living, at least for a few 
years after they leave school. Many 
others desire, as a form of insurance 
against disaster, to be self support
ing even though the necessity may 
not be present or apparent. Business 
offers an excellent and congenial field 
for young women and it presents op
portunities for them to make use of 
natural traits. No one is in greater 
demand than the well educated, 
trained secretary. And here is at
tractive work for the business-minded 
girl who has initiative, reliability, and 
endurance.
DEPARTMENT OF SECRE
TARIAL STUDIES.
In the year 1903, when the plan of 
a proposed Carnegie School of Tech
nology wTas presented, the Commit
tee advised the establishment, among 
others, of a course of instruction for 
Librarians and Secretaries. The

building in 1905, with Miss Harriette

DELTA THETA.
The Delta Theta Sororiety was 
formed November 1914, by the union 
of the Pai Delta Gamma and the 
Theta Lambda Sororities. The Psi 
Delta Gamma Sorority, was the first 
Sorority in M. M. C. S. that was 
allowed to exist. It was organized in 
March, 1910, with nine charter mem
bers: Margaret McQuiston, Florence
Flinn, Sarah Frazer, Katherine 
Swichart Lynch, Margaretta Nichols, 
Sahar Nolin, Laureta Kempel Wenslow, Edna Atwood and Eleanor 
Clark. The purpose of the Sorority 
was to promote good fellowship, 
scholarship and social intercourse. 
The Theta Lambda Sorority wras orgainzed in May 1912. The five char
ter members were Lenora Honecker, 
Millie Layman, Elizabeth Stevenson, 
Lillian Crawford and Jean Horigan.
In the hope of having a national 
chapter installed the two sororities 
joined in November 1914, under the 
name of Delta Theta. The member
ship includes fifty-five of whom twen
ty are active.
The Active Members are: May

HISTORY OF DEPARTMENTS
Continued from Page 5 
Munson of Mechanics Institute as in
structor in sewing, and Mrs. Morrin 
as part-time instructor. They work
ed here for a year and a term.
When the M. M. C. S. was complet
ed, the department moved into the 
rooms now occupied by the Secretar
ial studies. At that time Rooms 311 
and 313 were each divided into two 
rooms, and used for millinery, sew
ing and dress making, while Room 
312 was equipped with power sewing 
machines. After a years work the 
rooms were changed to their present 
size.
In the beginning the department 
aimed to have dressmakers assist
ants, and designs. The aim of the 
night school was distinctly for trade 
training.
The greatest changes occurred in 
1912-13, when the whole curriculum 
was revised to meet the requirments 
of a degree given first in 1913. That 
year the Teachers Course was intro
duced and five students, graduates of 
former years, came back for a years 
work and took their degree that year.
While the subjects taught are some
what similar, the grade of work re
quired is of a much higher order. In
addition to greater efficiency in the 
home, the department aims to train 
teachers of Sewing and Dressmaking, 
and brings, as the work advances, to 
develop initiative in students, so that 
they may seek professions in new 
fields closely allied to the various 
subjects now taught.
Of the former members of staff lit
tle is known. Mrs. Gibbs is living in 
New York, Miss Munson, Miss Adair 
and Miss Johnston are married and 
living in other cities. Miss Stannard 
is resting and preparing for a new 
field of work. Miss Donovan, a part 
time instructor is teaching in the city 
schools at night.
It seems rather strange that after 
working under the names of Textiles 
and Middle work, Sewing and Dress
making and Dress and Costume Eco
nomics; the department reverts to 
practically its original name.
THE HOME ARTS AND CRAFTS 
DEPARTMENT.
The powers that be must have 
been awake to the present need in 
America of more art education, for 
at the very outset they fell in line 
with the modern movement and in
stalled two instructors as follows: 
Miss Florence Baldwin, Instructor in 
Drawing, and Miss Harriet L. Merriam, Instructor in Design. This was 
in 1907.
The next year, Miss Jessie M. Adair 
took her place with the change of 
title to that of Costume Design, and 
this duet continued through the fol
lowing year. In the year 1910-11, 
Miss Baldwins name appears in the 
catalogue as head of the Department 
of Drawing and Design.
The following summer a committee 
having been appointed to reconstruct 
the whole plan of the curriculum with 
.the idea of granting degrees, they de
cided to broaden the scope of the art 
work and inaugurated what is known 
as the Home Arts and Crafts Depart
ment. This new plan was to call into 
being such crafts as were specially 
adapted to the home.
In 1912 Miss B. E. Merrile came to 
introduce lace making and weaving. 
Meantime the pottery equipment hav
ing been installed, Miss Farran began 
the teaching of pottery. Miss Mar
ion K. Patton from the Department 
of General Studies was called in to 
teach History of Art and to assist in 
the Drawing.
The following year Mr. Ralph Hol
mes of the Design School kindly con
sented to act as head of the depart
ment with Miss Merrill as head in
structor. Both believing that a strong 
art course is fundamental to the 
crafts, Miss A. Irene Struthers was 
called from the Cleveland High 
School to teach the design and gen
eral art work. That year marked an 
epoch in the history of the department 
in that the entire course of study was 
gone over and revised. Pottery was 
introduced in the plebe year and 
leather work was begun.
This year, however, his hands being 
full of work in the Design School, Mr. 
Holmes was unable to continue as 
head and Miss Merrill was given that

Continued from Page 6 
responsibility. Miss Struthers was 
made Assistant Professor of Design, 
and Miss Patten having gone to New 
York to engage in literary work, Miss 
Mabel Dixon, a graduate of Teachers 
College, who had specialized in inter
ior decoration, was called to teach the 
drawing and home decoration. She 
also brought forth the book-binding 
and metal work, which had been be
gun in a small way the year before.
With the opening of the present 
year the department has had a valua
ble acquisition in the person of Miss 
Erma Hewitt, who is not only a grad
uate in the jewelry course of Pratt 
Institute but who has had three years 
of studio experience in New York 
added to a practical teaching exper
ience. Though jewelry is the subject 
in which she is considered an expert, 
her plebe basketry has been so popular 
that it has been difficult to keep the 
whole school from weaving baskets.
Next year with the re-installation 
of the ceramic equipment and the im
portation of an expert potter, the de
partment expects to do still better 
work and to continue to raise the 
standard of each art and craft artisti
cally and technically. Then some
time in the near future this technical 
school may become a mecca for those 
seeking special training in these 
courses some of which cannot be se
cured anywhere else in the United 
States.
Through few have as yet graduated 
from this department those having 
done good work and having sufficient 
personality have had no difficulty in 
securing postions whereby they have 
been able not only to earn a livelihood 
but also to be of real service. For 
instance, of the two graduates in 1914, 
one was at once engaged as art super
visor in the public schools of Pitts
burgh and the other went to teach 
art and craft work in a mission school 
in North Carolina. The latter has 
since gone to teach in a mission school 
in Egypt (Africa). Though there will 
be no graduate this June there is a 
promising class of seven for 1917.
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL 
WORK.
The Department of Social Work is 
the youngest of the Margaret Mor
rison professional groups as it dates 
back only to 1914, when a Course in 
Social Service was announced for 
the first time. Miss Janet Van Hise, 
who had come to the School two 
vears previously, had given courses 
in Sociology, Economics, Ethics, and 
Principle of Social Work, and a small 
class of two made visits to local char
itable institutions. A more extended 
program of practical work, including 
methods of various types of social 
effort and several hours of practice 
work each week, was announced 
when Miss Idah Hopkins was added 
to the staff and the name of the de
partment was changed that year to 
the Department of Social Work. 
The program for the Department 
ns now outlined trains young women 
for work with childrenin (1) rec
reation centers, such as settlements
and playgrounds, and in (2) institu
tions caring for children. Beside these 
two avenues of service, special oppor
tunities for training in other lines of 
work is offered graduates and special 
students, depending upon previous ed
ucation and experience.
Enrollment in the Department for 
this year numbers only fifteen, but 
the group makes up in enthusiasm 
what it lacks in numbers, and elective 
courses offered during the year have 
reached sixty-five students from other 
Departments, including twenty-five 
from the Design School.
The staff, too, is limited, number
ing only two members. Miss Van 
Hise is a graduate of the University 
of Missouri, where she majored in 
Economics and Sociology, and has 
had a year of special study in New 
York. Miss Hopkins graduated from 
Grinnell College and did graduate 
work at the University of Pennsyl
vania. She was registrar of the New 
York School of Philanthropy for four 
years, and has done various kinds of 
professional social work in New York, 
Philadelphia and Iowa.
GENERAL STUDIES.
The department of General Studies 
as a department dates back only to 
interregnum between Miss Wests 
and Miss Breeds deanships, when the 
Director was the active dean of Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie School.
Miss Florence Baldwin, whom 
some of us later knew as head 
of the department of art, was first 
instructor of English and Prof. Willet combined General History with 
instruction in Industrial Economics. 
That was in 1906 when our school was 
allotted a corner of the Industries 
building.
This year marks the emergence of 
English and History as subjects selfsustaining and unassociated with art 
and economics, although there was no 
indication of this assuming the dig
nity of a department.
In the catalogue for 1909, English 
and History have a large and promi
nent place with courses in Grammar, 
Rhetoric, Oral English, Composition, 
Correspondence, Literatureall High 
School requirements, and, Ancient, 
Mediaeval and Modern History. The 
next step in the rise of English and 
History appears in 1910 when they 
were raised to the dignity of a de
partment of History and English un
der the direction of Miss Harding.
Another shuffling of cards and 
shifting of faculty brought Miss Bray 
out as Assistant Professor of English 
and Head of Department of Office 
Economy; Miss Vermocken as Assist
ant Professor of History and Head 
of the Department of History, Lan
guage and Literature.
With the coming of Dr. Day, Col. 
Frank P. of the 185th Highlanders at 
the present writing, this was the 
year of the directors reignthe pres
ent general studies department came 
into being, intended to include all 
academic studies and as a catch all 
for subjects not otherwise disposed

even axter the return of the latter.
When Ur. Day decided that he must 
ennst with his countrymen, he was 
granted a leave and Miss Farry select
ed to act as head during his absence, 
and Mr. Shirley Mason was called to 
take the extra work in English, as a 
substitute. i\ow, because he has re
reived a fine appointment in the gov
ernment department of Agriculture, 
the administration is releasing him in 
the middle of March, and his work 
will be taken care of in the depart
ment with Miss Sally McEwan as 
theme reader for the rest of the sem
ester.
SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.
The growth of the Science Depart
ment has been commensurate with 
the growth of the Margaret Morrison 
School. During the first year of the 
schools history, occasional lectures 
on scientific subjects were given by 
teachers from the other schools of 
the Carnegie group. In 1907 Mr. Ed
mund Esquerre, a graduate of the 
Academy of Toulouse, France, was 
appointed Associate Professor of 
Chemistry. A three-year course in 
chemistry was then offered. The num
ber of students taking this subject 
was such that in 1910 Miss Alline 
M. Speer A. B. (Vassar) was appoint
ed Instructor in this department.
The Department of Science has as 
its object the furnishing of a true 
scientific foundation for the various 
courses offered in the Margaret Mor
rison School, and the preparation of 
teachers of one or more of the scien
tific subjects. To enable our students 
to take a more extensive course in 
Physics than our present equipment 
will allow, arrangements have been 
made with Dean Leete for their ad
mission to the well equipped labora
tories of the School of Applied Sci
ence. We feel the need of more math
ematics, especially for our students 
who are preparing to teach science. 
Mr. Rush and Miss Bellville are giving 
some rather advanced mathemat
ics to these students this year. We 
hope this work will be required of our 
science students in the future.
The number of graduations from 
the Science Department has been 
very smallfour since the organiza
tion of the Department. It should 
be remembered, however, that this 
department is young in spite of the 
fact that it has been represented by 
one of its branches since founding 
of the school.
M. M. C. S. ALUMNAE
Continued from Page 1 
new business is discussed, and the of
ficers for the following year are 
elected. Following the business 
meeting, a reception is given in honor
of the graduating class. A calendar 
of the social events of the year is 
sent to each member of the Associa
tion early in the fall, and it is at these 
social gatherings that the Alumnae 
discuss in an informal way plans for 
the future that will strengthen and develope our Association.
During the past seven years the 
Alumnae Association has progressed 
rapidly and it is hoped that within 
the next seven years something really 
worth while may be accomplished. 
For this reason, it is urged that the 
Seniors who will soon be a part of 
the Association and the underclass
men who are planning toward that 
end will come into the Alumnae with 
loyal hearts and willing hands to help 
with the work which has been so well 
started.
CUSTOMS AND ANNUAL EVENTS
Continued from Page 1 
room, held sacred to Seniors only. 
It is designated as the Senior Locker 
Room, but it is in reality a clearing 
house for too heavy assignments, fac
ulty and school gossip, in short, 
everything, but work.
One of the long remembered events 
of a Seniors life is the last Assembly. 
The dean usually speaks on some ap
propriate topic, and at the close, the 
Seniors slowly march out, singing 
Farewell, Alma Mater, while the 
underclassmen remain standing.
During Commencement week, there 
is what is called Ivy Day. At this 
time an oration is read by a Senior 
(which honor has been tried for and 
given to the one offering the best 
paper). At the close of the reading, 
the speaker then plants a piece of ivy 
in front of the school. In 1915, the 
Senior Class bought a spade with the 
class manuals upon it, which was used 
to throw the first earth on the plant. 
At the close of the exercises it was 
then presented to the president of the 
Junor Class to be kept by her and 
used in the ceremony the next year. 
At that time it was to be inscribed 
with their class numerals and handed 
down to the succeeding class.
One of the most distinctive and 
best known of the customs of the 
school is the Boars Head Procession. 
It has been used in the school many 
years, taking place at Christmas time, 
usually in connection with some en
tertainment by the Dramatic Club or 
other organization of the school. It 
is a survival of early English customs 
and includes two pages, the cook, 
bearing the boars head, the lord and 
lady, and the jester.
Like the colleges, each class in M. 
M. C. S. chooses an honorary mem
ber of their class from the faculty. 
Tn 1914 it was Dr. Esquerre; in 1915 
Miss Frances Parry; in 1916, Miss 
Marie Belleville, and the present 
Junior Class has chosen Miss Demarest.
In the matter of choosing class col
ors it is a rule to always include gold 
and one other color, as the gold is 
one of the two colors of the school, 
the other being white. This last year, 
it was decided to have only four dif
ferent class colors, and to have them 
rotate in order continuouslythe in
coming Plebe class taking the outgo
ing Seniors class colors, etc.

ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION
Continued from Page 2 
curing of the season book of tickets 
from the mens association at special 
rates. This helped to create a spirit 
of unity between the schools and en
couraged the girls to attend the 
games in groups.
Sixty members paying dues of fifty 
cents only gave the association thirty 
dollars. The budget for the year 
amounted to forty-one dollars. On 
a Friday evening, January 15th, the 
association gave a dancethe first 
dance given by day students that year. 
Sixty-five couples were present and 
twenty dollars cleared.
A schedule of basket ball games 
was made but poorly carried out be
cause of the long hours and conflict
ing classes.
At the demonstration of physical 
training, March 19th, the officers 
aided Miss Stoner by acting as ushers, 
keeping the doors and helping in vari
ous ways.
On April 16th, late in the after
noon, the M. M. C. S. varsity played 
the University of Pittsburgh in our 
gymnasium. We were defeated, but 
the game was not a walk-over for 
Pitt, and it was a decisive victory over 
school spirit something we needed 
badly last year.
On April 20th the association held 
its second annual business meeting. 
Marion D. Pichel succeeded Marguer
ite Spilman as president. It was vot
ed to award sweaters to the varsity 
team, and after interviews at the 
boys gym we were permitted to use 
the plaid C as our emblem.
On April 29th, our team played its 
second game with Pitt in Trees gym
nasium. We were again defeated but 
only by a small score.
On May 19th an athletic meet was 
held on the field. A cup was awarded 
by Miss Stoner to the class winning 
the most points. It went to the 
Plebes.
At an assembly on May 24th, di
rectly after the installation of the stu
dent government officers, our basket 
ball team received varsity sweaters. 
Miss Stoner made a talk and gave 
them out. The six girls receiving the 
honor were Marguerite Spilman, 15, 
Marion Pichel, 16, Marguerite Menges, 16, Florence Burgham, 17, Mar
garet Wirth, 17, Helen Wassel, 17.
There was no tennis tournament in 
the spring due to heavy rains.
The activity of the association this 
y^nr has been greatly hampered. Desp-te the efforts of the officers and the 
Department of Physical Training it 
has been impossible to do very much 
toward fostering the work. Miss Pi
chel has been most valuable to the 
association both as executive and 
participant in the athletics. She was 
succeeded by Margaret Wirth at the 
annual meeting this spring.

THE PAN HELLENIC SOCIETY
Continued from Page 2 
two years. Each sorority pays 
monthly dues which is used to help 
defray the cost of the annual dance 
and to pay for a page in the Thistle.
The first formal dance was held 
April, 1913, in the gymnasium, and 
the lunch room, the refreshments 
were served in the faculty parlors. 
By some mistake the lights were 
turned out at eleven oclock, but 
candles were procured in Oakland, 
and the dance continued in the much 
softer, prettier light of candles stuck 
in every possible crack. The second 
dance, May, 1914, was held in the 
gymnasium and the one in 1915 in 
Union Hall.
In the Fall of 1914, the Pan Hel
lenic committee, later the whole 
group of sorority members, were 
called upon to decide two important 
questions. First, whether national 
sororities should be petitioned at the 
wish of the undivided sorority, or if 
the sororities should all remain local, 
or if sororities should be discontinued 
entirely. It was voted to continue 
sororities and to have freedom in pe
titioning certain national sororities. 
The second question was that of the 
undemocratic condition of the lim
ited Pan Hellenic sorority. The 
other three sororities had proved 
that thev were to stay, so in 1915 they 
were incited to send representatives 
to the Pn Hellenic Committee and 
to endorse its revised constitution. A 
few monfhs before, the Psi Delta 
Gamma Sorority had combined with 
the Theta Lambda to form the Delta 
Theta. Thus the new Pan Hellenic 
Society was composed of the Theta 
Sigma, Delta Delta, Alpha Psi, AlGROGAN COMPANY0 i

Continued from Page 1
now have courses in Home Arts and 
Crafts, in training for Social Work, 
and in General Science. During the 
last few years, since the School has 
been conferring degrees, there have 
been many changes in curriculum and 
in standards of work, methods of 
teaching, and in all those internal 
matters that make no showing before 
the general public, but which are the 
very life current of the School. No 
one has been more interested in all 
these changes than the older Alum
nae, whose loyalty and love for their 
Alma Mater are unchanging. No 
great alterations in the Day School 
are contemplated for the future, only 
a general strengthening of the teach
ing and of the standards. In the 
Night School, it is hoped that we may 
increase our usefulness by ^certain 
modifications now under considera
tion, which are largely in the hands of 
Miss Holmes, appointed this year Su
pervisor of Night School.
The future of the School, however, 
lies in the hands of its students, far 
more than in those of administrative 
officers or faculty. For them the 
School exists, and from them as its 
product it judges itself wise or un
wise. The most important gift the 
School can bestow is not a degree, 
not the ability to earn a living, not 
P1Tfn a store of knowledge, but it is 
r> bv-nroduct t^at we call character. 
The trained will and the discriminat
ing: mind and the nobler forms of 
emotional lifethese are the things 
t^at make onr cold schedules of curi.'uium worth while.
NIGHT SCHOOL.
The Night School at Margaret Mor
n-on started in 1906, the second year 
of t^e cchools history, when room, 
were occunied in the Industry School 
From the first the Night School was 
a uccess. Its courses offered were 
r>mcticnl. and as a result, popular. At 
present there is some work offered 
in nearlv every department of the 
the majority of students being, 
in the Secretarial Home Arts and 
C i-pft;. Coctume Economics and 
TTnncehold Economics departments, 
Tt ic p cnl^ndid onoortunitv for girls 
who finri impossible during the da\ 
?n take this work, to do so at night 
And these erirls should be compli

it takes ambition and a strong realiza
tion of the true values of life to com
plete such a course.
A pair of glasses was found at the 
gymnasium Friday night, after the
Allegheny game. Owner can recover 
them at Mr. McCullochs office in 
the gymnasium building.
