Described
Author Of New Book 
Spent Years In USSR
The background of Russias edu
cational system is explained in a 
new book released yesterday by 
Carnegie Press, scholarly publish
ing division of Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. .
The new book is Russias Edu
cational Heritage, by Dr. William 
H. E. Johnson, Supervisor of 
Teacher Education at Carnegie 
Tech.
Dr. Johnson worked in the So
viet educational system for three 
years, from 1934 to 1937. He 
taught in teacher-training institu
tions and lectured in factory 
schools, hospitals and sports so
cieties. After he learned Russian, 
he traveled all over the country.
In his book, Dr. Johnson studies 
the major educational policies and 
programs characterizing the last 
three centuries of the Tsarist re
gime, and traces the long struggle 
to establish a system of education 
in Tsarist Russia. He also points 
out the many strong similarities 
between Empire and Soviet praeitces, indicating unmistakably that 
the new state is built upon the 
foundation of the old.
Dr. Johnson has studied the edu
cational policies and patterns of 
the Russians at the sourcein the 
training of teachersand he tells 
in graphic terms of the influence 
.of church and state upon the 
kinds of schools established, the 
effects of the first schools upon the 
peoples desire for educational 
facilities, and the resulting conflict 
between the people and their gov
ernment.
The author holds a Ph.D. in edu
cation from Columbia. Since his 
return to the United States in 1937, 
he has continued his investigation 
of Russian education. During 
World War II, he worked with 
the U. S. Government.
Russias Education Heritage, 
 the third title to be published by 
Carnegie Press, will be distributed 
by arrangements with the Rutgers 
University Press in New Bruns

Freshma n Regu la tions
Most colleges have a hazing period when freshmen are maul
ed with the idea of impressing their newness on them. Instead, 
Carnegie has developed a program to help the new student find 
his way around.
As you know by now, every freshman must wear a Skibo 
cap and a name plate. He must also greet upperclassmen in an 
amiable manner. Wearing your cap is no disgrace, but is the 
best way of getting acquainted on campus. The dink marks you 
as a newcomer, and the tag makes it easier for you to get acquaint
ed with upperclassmen and your own fellow freshmen.
Freshmen are required to attend all Freshman rallies, assemb
lies, and home football games. Freshmen women are required to 
participate in the activities designated by Cwens. One objective of 
these regulations is to make you proud of your class and of Car
negie. The quickest way to feel at home at Tech is to get in the 
swing of activities. Missing football games and pep rallies means 
missing out on some of the best fun in your college life.
The senior fence and senior walk are two places on campus 
traditionally reserved for upperclassmen, and ireshmen are not 
permitted on them. The senior fence is the timber fence east of 
Engineering Hall, and the senior walk is the sidewalk to Machinery 
Hall nearest to Engineering Hall, Freshmen must use the Industries 
Hall walk. In addition, Freshman women must use the steps to the 
left of the center door in Margaret Morrison,
Every student should know something about his school to ap
preciate it. With this in mind, Cwens and Scimitars have prepared 
a list of information and songs to be learned. A traditionas exam 
will be held sometime in October, and a grade of 70% is passing. 
Failure means suspension from extra-curricular activities until the 
second test a month later, held for those who did not pass the 
first. No-one should have to take the repeat test, for after be
ing at Tech for a few weeks, he will know most of the Informa
tion on the lists.
These rules will be enforced by Cwens and Scimitars, the 
sophomore honoraries. Five percent will be deducted from the tra
ditions exam score for every major offense, such as missing an 
assembly or not wearing a dink.
The upperclassmen hope that by means of these regulations, 
we can help you to get acquainted faster, learn about the school, 
and get into the swing of activities quickly.

Editorials
Wear Em With Pride
!The freshman class has started well on its 
way to becoming the first class since before 
the war to take the phrase school spirit 
for what it really means. The recognition 
of campus traditions and certain freshmen 
regulations by the class of 54 is proof that 
for the first time in a decade, the ingredients 
which help to make up spirit on a college 
campus are once again present at Carnegie.
It has been a long and tiresome fight by 
Scimitars and Cwens during the past several 
years to restore the traditional freshman regula
tions on campus. To them we offer our con
gratulations and sincere wishes that the will
ingness of this year's freshmen to cooperate will 
encourage the sophomore class honoraries to 
work even harder in keeping and enforcing the 
freshmen regulations.
To the freshmen, we also encourage them 
to keep up the good work. Just how much 
spirit is to mean at Carnegie during your 
four years here depends entirely on how 
well you accept the freshmen regulations 
this fall, and continue to enforce them in 
succeeding years.
Wear your dink for the required period of 
time; it will help you to become better ac
quainted with your fellow-freshmen, as well as 
with upperclassmen. Learn the school songs 
and cheers; they are not too difficult to learn, 
and mean a great deal to the support of our 
football team. Become acquainted with the 
campus traditions and organizations; they can 
be of great assistance to you during your four 
years at Carnegie.
THE URGE TO KILL
Our Code
Like any other activity on campus, the 
college newspaper must be able to justify 
its existence and the effort and expense de
voted to it. The question has frequently 
been posed, often seriously, Why a Tartan?
We feel that there are two ways in which 
the Tartan serves the school and student body: 
first, it reports campus news and prints an
nouncements of general interest to the faculty 
and student body; secondly, it is an activity which 
provides training and recreation to those stu
dents who take part in it.
In carrying out the above ends, we will 
try to the utmost to let the following code 
guide us:
... to print the truth insofar as we are 
able to see and understand it.
... to serve the student body with the 
thought in mind that the powers and respon
sibilities of a students paper derive from its 
representation of the student body.
... to recognize Student Council as utiliizng the Tartan as an auxiliary, but never 
a tool.
... to criticize constructively where 
criticism is due, to give credit where it is 
deserved.
... to provide leadership when necessa
ry, to plead caution when restraint is essen
tial.
... to provide a paper that instructs as 
well as entertains, that informs as well as 
asserts.
. . . and finally, to provide at all times 
responsible journalism with standards as 
high as the highest.
Letter To The Freshmen
Scimitars Urge 
Freshmen Spirit
Since your arrival on our campus, Frosh, you 
have been introduced to many of the activities and 
organizations which have, through the years, come 
to be associated, and become integral parts of 
Carnegie Tech. They are the fraternities, clubs, 
publications, sports; they are the groups like the 
Kiltie Band and the YMCA and YWCA. Soon you 
will begin becoming acquainted with the Carneige Plan/' the educational program which to 
many is just as important as the extra-curricular 
activities.
But when do you, as a freshman, also become 
a part of this picture? It is after you have cheer
ed your team; it is after you have passed a trations exam; it is after you have contributed some
thing to the oranizatiogn of your class. Then you 
will no longer be a neophyte, a frosh just learnin the ropes. Youll be a full fledged member 
of what should be the greatest class, the Class of 
54, in the greatest school, Carnegie Tech, Yours 
will be the greatest class and school if you do 
something to make it just that!
Until the time when the upperclassmen accept 
you as an initiate in the life of our campus you 
must wear your famed and universally worn 
dinks. The name tag that you are required to 
wear will help us to get acquainted. The dinks 
and tags do not set you apart; rather, they mark 
you as one belonging to a group of men and 
women who aspire to be a part of the school 
which is to be their Alma Mater.

. . . Social Relation courses were broadened so 
that freshmen could now enjoy the benefits de
rived from this enlightenment to modern educa
tion.
. . . Twenty-two football players were being
assisted financially by alumni clans located in 19 
cities throughout the country, and seven fraterni
ties were aiding by providing rooms for the ath
letes.
. . . The Tartan was campaigning against fresh
men regulations, maintaining that freshmen have 
it hard enough without subjecting themselves to 
humiliation by a few individuals with a perverted 
idea of their own importance.
. . . Carnegie's Merle Condit and George Muha 
were being touted for all-American honors, while 
a couple of Carnegie students by the name of 
Don Campbell and Jack Lee were playing for the 
Pittsburgh Steelers while still taking undergraduate 
work at Carnegie.
. . . The average starting salary of the class of 
'39 was reported to be $122 a month by the Place

Carnegie Signs 
New Contract 
With Rutgers
Munn Heads Group; 
New Books Scheduled
The Carnegie Press, publishing 
division of Carnegie Tech, has an
nounced renewal for another year 
of its unique cooperative arrange
ment with the Rutgers University 
Press.
Under terms of the  agreement, 
begun when the Carnegie Press 
was organized in 1947, the older, 
more established Rutgers Press 
provides the use of its facilities 
and staff in the areas of editorial 
supervision, distribution, purchas
ing, advertising, and promotion.
The Carnegie Press is admin
istered by a book publication com
mittee with a director of the press 
acting in an executive capacity.
Dr. Ralph Munn, dean of the 
Carnegie Library School, is chair
man of the book publication com
mittee. Stanley R. March, director 
of public relations and secretary 
of the committee, is director of 
the press.
To date, the press has published 
two books: Encores on Main
Street: Successful Community 
Theatre Leadership, by H. Tal
bot Pearson; and Education for 
Professional Responsibility, a re
port of the inter-professions con
ference held at Buck Hill Falls, 
Pa., in 1948.
Two new books are scheduled 
for publication this spring and 
fall: Russias Educational Heri
tage, by William H. E. Johnson, 
and Printing Types and How to 
Use Them, by Stanley C. Hlastai
By Dolly Mitchell 
TV OR NOT TV . . . Carnegie
drama graduates are going great 
guns in the field of television. 
Wes Kenny is directing shows for 
Dumont, while Norman Keats is 
playing the role of villain in the 
Captain Video show, of all things. 
Dottie Kaye recently held the fea
ture spot on Studio One, another 
TV show. Methinks Carnegie 
should rate a free TV set for 
services rendered to television. 
MORE FLYING SAUCERS . . . 
Ever since the Provosts office had 
new lamps instaled, there have 
been rumors about flying saucers 
on campus.
HALLS OF FAME . . . Did you
know that Webb Hall and Jones 
Hall were named after Dr. Webster 
Jones, Dean of Engineering and 
Science.
CUT-RATE . . . The Book Store 
is beginning to look like Sun Drug 
Inc. In addition to carrying every
thing on the line ol sciiool supplies, 
the Book Store now sells T-shirts, 
jackets, scrap books, photo albums, 
pocket magazines, and greeting 
cards. Everything from books to 
nuts.
THE KILTIES ARE COMING...
Who dares say that our bagpipers 
arent among the finest in the 
country? This summer bagpiper Jo 
Davidson, sophomore, won second 
prize in the novice competition of 
bagpipers held at Kennywood 
Park. Another piper, Robert Kuen* 
zig, was featured in two civic light 
operas in Pittsburgh during the 
summer.
A MILLION FOR FIFTY GRAND
. . . You havent heard the last of 
Fifty Grand, the play written by 
Kenny Welsh, a playwright grad. 
After a long run at the Playhouse 
this amateur work with that pro
fessional touch moved on to Chi
cago. May Fifty Grand live a 
long and prosperous life in the 
legitimate theater.
THERELL BE SOME CHANGES 
MADE . . . Starke Drischell, an
other playwright graduate, is hie
ing out of the country, but fast. 
Starke expects to leave in October 
for Germany where he will work 
with the armed forces as an en
tertainment specialist.
FREE BEER? . . . The new public 
relations office in room 127, Indus
tries, really has class. The entire 
office is done in light wood panel
ing and, best of all, it has an at
tractive wooden counter which 
looks rather like a bar. There has 
been no office-warming as of yet. 
MISSING PERSONS . . . Lost; 
One smiling face from the Dean of 
Mens office. Dottie Stewart, the 
deans secretary, is moving to Dr. 
Bachs office as his secretary. 
FRESHMEN! ... Oh, those dear, 
naive freshmen! One freshman 
stopped Alice Hale, Dr. Miners 
secretary, and asked, Could you 
tell me where I can find the Bur
eau of Alliance and Measure
ment?
Another freshman bounced into 
the Dean of Mens office and said, 
Im here; Im a freshman; what 
do I do? He said it all in one 
breath.

According to Carnegie officials, 
the plan is being expanded be
cause it has been found to have 
two major advantages: (1) it gives 
a student a chance to build a 
broad liberal arts foundation be

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests 
Number 1...THE PUFFIN BIRD
What's all the huffin and puffin about? 
Ive been a Puffin all my life!
Y.ou may think this bird is funny  but hes no 
odder than many of the cigarette tests youre asked to make these days.
One puff of this brand  one sniff of that. A quick inhale  a fast exhale 
and youre supposed to know what cigarette to smoke from then on. The sensible 
test doesnt have to rely on tricks and short cuts. Its a day-afterday, pack-after-paek tryout  for 30 days. Thats the 
test Camel asks you to make! Smoke Camels regularly for 
30 days. Your T-Zone (T for Throat, T for Taste) 
is the best possible proving ground for any cigarette.
After youve made the Camel 30-Day Mildness Test, 
we believe youll know why ...
More People Smoke Camels
than any other cigarette!

SPORTSCOPE
By
Fred Lunf
Although there can be no doubt concerning the mental 
attitude of Carnegie Techs gridiron warriors, there is, as 
usual, some question concerning the .attitude of the stu
dents. The players are ready for any opponent; they believe 
they have what it takes to win.
That should be obvious from the comments of several 
of the gridders that are printed elsewhere on this page. 
If you are the type that doesnt believe everything you read, 
we suggest that you visit the practice field some after
noon and see for yourself. You will discover an air of con
fidence surrounding the activities there; you will see a group 
of athletes anxious to learn and even more anxious to win.
However, the players themselves cannot bring home the 
victories. Oh, yes, they do have enough spirit to win a couple 
of games on their own; but to become a real winning team, 
they need the wholehearted support of the student body. Wheth
er they get that support depends entirely upon you students. 
Anyone who has been here for the past couple of years knows 
what a tremendous lack of spirit and support on behalf of the 
students there has been.
Last year school spirit did improve somewhat; but this 
increase in spirit was not the result of a change in stu
dent attitude. Rather it was the result of the team show
ing the students that they could win football games. The 
students then climbed on the bandwagon. Here we are 
again on the eve of another gridiron season and there still 
is the question of whether or not the students are going 
to back their team. The question shouldnt even exist, but 
it does.
And dont think it doesn't exist in the minds of the play
ers. Anyone who has played a varsity sport of any kind knows 
what a tremendous lift it gives a team to now that they have 
a unified student body behind them. Many times an average 
team has risen to greatness just because of that extra push 
provided by the students.
Freshmen, here is one phase of college life where you 
can teach the upper-classmen a few things. Almost all of 
you have just graduated from high school, where school 
spirit often gains fever pitch. Dont let that spirit die, 
freshmen, but just keep it going here at Carnegie and youll 
be doing all of us a tremendous service. By showing the 
veteran students just what school spirit is they might pick
up and follow your lead.
Your team will be ready for the opening kickoff, students. 
Lets show them that were all behind them all the way. Lets 
get our heads out of the textbooks for a couple of hours on Fri
day evenings and Saturday afternoons and give the team the 
added push that will make it a real winner.
Simcic Leads 
Tartan Squad 
This Season
Dr. Eddie Baker, head football 
coach at Carnegie, has named half
back Nick Simcic as captain of the 
1950 gridiron team. Simcic, a sen
ior, takes over the post held last 
year by tackle Gerry Meyers, who 
is now an alumnus.
A graduate of Washington Vo
cational High School, which did 
not field a football team, Simcic 
had played only a little sandlot 
football before entering CIT. Dur
ing his first year at Carnegie he 
stayed away from the gridiron, ap
plying all his efforts to the class
room.
Breaking-in during his sopho
more year, Simcic immediately 
gained the first team left halfback 
position which he has held during 
both the 1948 and 1949 seasons.

Rifle Team Confident 
As Lettermen Return
By Justin Davidson
As rifle competition joins the ranks of varsity sports, Sergeant 
Reed, who is in charge of the ROTC rifle team which is limited t 
cadets and the Rifle and Pistol club which is open to all students, 
is looking forward to a successful year.
From last years team, which* " "
placed sixth in the William Ran
dolph Hearst national competi
tion for ROTC teams, four out of 
six lettermen are returning. Al
though the loss of Pete Smith and 
John Bachoeffer will be sorely felt,
John Montstream, A1 Blotcky,
John Kolbe. and Jack Unangst will 
be back.
The ROTC team will be firing 
regular competition in the Great
er Pittsburgh Rifle League which 
includes teams from West Virginia 
University, W&J, and California 
State Teachers as well as Pitt and 
Carnegie. Duquesne is an unof
ficial member of the league.
Of some interest is the fact that 
the Carnegie team is to meet Du
quesne twice this year in shoulderto-shoulder competition. Duquesne 
placed teams first, second, and 
third last year in the Hearst 
matches postal competition, al
though the Plaid beat them twice 
last year in shoulder-to-shoulder 
competition.
In shoulder-to-shoulder compe
tition the teams fire at the same 
range and check each others 
scores. In postal competition each
team fires at its own range and 
checks its own scores. Scheduled 
f  this season at Carnegie is a 
new method, competition by ra
dio. The teams fire at their home 
ranges and a running score of the 
match is kept by radio. Sergeant 
Reed believes this will be the first 
time this method has been at
tempted.
Any man or woman not in the 
ROTC and interested in rifle or 
pistol fire is urged to contact Ser
geant Reed in IH 242B. Forms for 
application to the Rifle and Pistol 
club as well as schedules for com
petition may be obtained from 
him.

Team Shows Spirit 
As Opener Nears
Starting Lineup Still Not Definite;
Injuries Cause Concern In Coaches
By Art Christopher
 When their scheduled scrimmage with Indiana State Teachers 
College was cancelled, Coach Eddie Baker put his Skibo gridders 
through a rigorous inter-squad scrimmage.
Apparently both teams realize that many of the starting 
positions are still undecided be-*1
cause most of them were really 
displaying an inspired brand of 
football. The team seems to be 
full of hustle and pep and they 
are all eagerly awaiting the open
ing game on September 30th with 
Davis & Elkins down at Forbes 
Field.
One of Eddie Bakers chief 
headaches is still the old story of 
injuries. At the present time such 
stalwarts as Fritz Wilson, Jack 
Magnifico, and Jim Norton are 
sidelined with injuries, although 
all three are expected to be avail
able for the first game.
In last Saturdays scrimmage, 
Jack Brourman started at quar
terback for the first team and he 
gave signs of developing into a 
top flight man at the all-important 
spot. The only question in the 
minds of everyone is whether or 
not his old knee injury of last 
year will keep him sidelined again 
this year.
On the line it was Floyd Wise
man who was again the standout
on almost every play. Wiseman was 
a constant threat to the opposing 
team as he broke through the line 
time and again to break up the 
play. His defensive play, along 
with his spirit and aggressiveness 
label the chunky guard as one of 
the men to watch this year on the 
Tartan line.
Veteran Lou Fougere and 
Freshman Dick Pakos started at 
the end posts and both played a 
bang up ball game, with Fougeres 
pass catching counting for two of 
the touchodwns.
With the exception of Wiseman 
and Clyde Stahle, who is slated for 
the starting left tackle position, the 
entire inside of the line will be 
made up of inexperienced men.
At the right guard spot, it is 
still a battle between Ray Shermeyer and George Rusnak. The 
nod at right tackle will probably 
go to either Hans Lange or Joe 
Galanda.
The brightest spot on the hori
zon for the Skibo coaching staff is

THEY SHOULD KNOWPlayers Show Trend
Of Cautious Optimism
Your roving sports reporter managed to sneak into the locker 
room prior to last Friday afternoons football practice and cornered 
several Carnegie gridders before they saw him coming their way.
Asked what sort of a team would represent Carnegie on the 
gridiron this fall and how success
ful a season is in store for Tartan
football followers, the players had 
these comments to make.
Lou Fougere, end  We have 
a faster team than we did last 
year. Lehigh, Case, and W & J 
will be tough, but we should have 
at least as good a season as we 
had last year.
Easier Schedule 
Quent Holtz, quarterbackThe 
schedule this year is easier than 
it was last year. None of the teams 
we will play will be out of upset 
range. Our team has more spirit 
than last year; everybody is out 
to win.
Hans Lange, tackle  Barring 
injuries, we should have a good 
team. Spirit is up, and the fellows 
want to play. With a little bit of 
luck, we should have a good seaBob Dougherty, end  If the 
team will put forth a little more 
than they did last year, well win 
them all. We have the system down 
now and have more confidence in 
ourselves, especially now that 
weve won a few.
Hard To Catch 
Fritz Wilson, end  It looks 
like a pretty good team, light but 
fast. Well be hard to catch.
Nick Simcic, halfback  If we 
dont have too many injuries, we 
should win more than half our 
games. Lehigh and Case will be 
rough but the others shouldnt be 
too tough.
Floyd Wiseman, guard  If the 
team stays in good physical shape, 
were going to win them all. Le
high will be the toughest team to 
beat. I have a lot of confidence in 
our team this year.

Eighty-Foot Mural At Airport
All-Carnegie Airport Completely Finished 
By Carnegie Architect, Engineer, Artist
Actually, the most appropriate place to paint a mural telling 
the story of aviation would be in the sky.
Of course, that cant be done. But people will still have to 
look straight up at an aviation mural recently completed by a 
Institute of Technology* '
y
Carnegie 
professor.
He has painted his mural on the 
ceiling of an airport terminal 
building.
, * The professor is Robert L. Lepper of Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, and the airport with the 
mural on top is the new field in 
Charleston, West Virginia, the 
Kanawha County Airport.
The mural, which covers the 
entire ceiling of the concourse in 
this million-dollar terminal, is a 
one-strip education in aviation. 
Eighty Feet 
Eighty feet long, the mural rep
resents aerial travel and the sci
ence that goes into making it 
faster and safer every year. Pro
fessor Leppers mural gives a 
feeling of the vastness of the in
dustry, too.
For example, at one end is 
shown a huge propection of the 
world. Centered is America and 
the Kanawha Airport. Branching 
out from there to all parts of the 
globe are the network lines of air 
lanes.
The science that has made pos
sible aviations conquest of time 
and space plays an important part 
in the mural. Markings and sym
bols known to the experienced 
flyer are shown, as well as the 
familiar long wind-tunnel used in 
testing wing strengths and air 
currents.
To symbolize air progress, the 
mural has likenesses of the con
ventional gasoline engine, and also 
the revolutionary jet engine that 
J has come into existence in the past 
decade.
Landing Field
At the other end of the eighty 
foot mural is a layout of a landing 
field complete with air strips, ra
dar screen, landing lights, and 
symbols of an instrument landing 
system of the most modern type. 
Jft More than a years planning 
went into the mural. Special prob
lems had to be solved. The plaster 
on the ceiling, for example, is
n
acoustic plaster designed to ab
sorb sound. Oil applied to it would 
destroy the absorbancy. Water 
paints which would not disturb 
this acoustic property had to be 
considered for the greater part of 
the mural. For six key areas, 
however, oil paint was used.
These key areas, says Profes
sor Lepper, had to be distributed 
over various parts of the ceiling 
to minimize acoustic loss.
In the Spring of 1949, after 
months of research, the design 
was completed. Then plans for the 
actual painting were worked out. 
Preparations were made for en
largement of the design to trans
fer it to the ceiling, and a special 
protective varnish for the oil areas 
had to be developed to minimize 
surface gloss.
Two Months
By March 1, 1950, all prepara
tions were completed, and the 
painting of the mural began. It 
took two months to finish.
While Professor Lepper worked 
from a movable scaffold, marble 
setters, carpenters, and iron work
ers were busy below him. Once 
each week Professor Lepper had 
to commute by plane between 
Charleston and Pittsburgh in or
der to teach his classes at Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. He was 
on partial leave from the Painting 
and Design Department at Car
negie.
Professor Lepper, who is an 
alumnus of Carnegie, could very 
well have worn his old school tie 
while painting his mural at Kana
wha. Two other alumni were key 
men in the designing and building 
of the airport building.
Cyrus E. Silling, a Carnegie edu
cated architect, designed the ter
minal building in which the mural 
was painted, and Charles J% Kuhn, 
Carnegie civil engineer graduate, 
was the contractor who .built it.

It looks like freshmen are here 
to stay. When the inquiring re
porter asked, What is your im
pression of Carnegie, the an
swers she received showed that 
the freshmen brought with them 
that little item missing for a while 
on campus, that little, important 
item called school spirit.
Carol Jones, freshman: I came to 
Tech because Ive been taking 
voice lessons
buildings; only the book store was 
hard to find. I had to wait four 
hours to get my schedules ap
proved. I think dinks are a cute 
idea. You know who the freshmen j 
are.
Jim Valias, freshman: I heard 
that Tech was a difficult college. 
You have to study hard, stay up 
late, and keep out of extra cur
ricular activities. Tech is more 
college-like than Pitt. You see ivycovered walls, a regular college. 
It is ^ ji^st ^ ^ as
anything about the food. The pie 
was the only good thing I had 
there.
Paul Smith, freshman: The main 
reason I came here was because 
I got a Westinghouse scholarship, 
i I was lost when
changed my mind quick when I 
saw the campus.
Jim Hall, freshman: Tech has a 
good reputation as a good en
gineering school. I like small col
leges. I live near Cornell. People 
there ask why I 
didnt go there,
friendly here. 
Its amazing. They make you feel 
right at home.
Sandy Crozier, freshman: Tech
has a good art school. Thats why 
I came here. I like the college, 
but there are 
too many build
ings and too 
many people 
here. When I 
was taking 
technicals last 
week, Id come 
home disgusted 
and my dad 
would say,
Youd think 
they were giv
ing the course free for nothing 
the way you sweat over it. I dont 
like dinks. I thought they Were 
out-lawed. They look like some
thing youd see on a co-ed.
The freshmen are interested and 
impressed with Carnegie Tech. So, 
it looks like the freshmen are here 
to stay, at least for a while; Car
negie certainly needs them.
