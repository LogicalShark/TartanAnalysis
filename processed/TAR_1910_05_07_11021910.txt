CARNEGIE TECH LOSES TO W. & J.
Last Saturday the three hundred rooters who ac
companied the team to Washington were sadly dis
appointed when we lost to W. & J., 80. The game 
was a good one in all respects, although Tech did not 
display its real form until the second half. W. & J. 
scored all its points during the first' half, Wallace 
making a touchdown near the end of the first quar
ter, and Forsythe kicking a field goal from the 35- 
yard line in the second. Tech was on the defensive 
throughout this half. When the men came out for 
the third quarter, the coaches talk had shown them 
wherein they were weak, and they were determined 
to retrieve their previous mistakes. During this 
quarter they rushed the ball from W. & J.s 45-yard 
line to the 4-yard line in a series. of clever 
plays, only to lose it on forward pass. 
In the last period also, we lost a 
chance to score by reason of the magnificent defense 
displayed by W. & J. Tech blocked a kick and 
Weaver recovered the ball on the 4-yard line. One 
play covered half of the distance, and W . & J. was 
penalized 1 yard for holding. Then the Red and 
Black braced and held like a wall for the next two 
downs.
All through this half, Tech did sensational work. 
McCorkle played a magnificent game, getting one 
forward pass after another for distances varying 
from 5 to 20 yards. Dyer also did some great work, 
both in advancing the ball and in breaking up plays. 
In one play he dove over a man who attempted to 
block him and nailed the runner for a loss. Big 
Bill Moorhead is also deserving of mention. His 
work was good throughout. For W. & J.,
Forsythe, Whitehill and Ingham were the stars.
Between the halves, the Tech rooters, headed by
their band, marched upon the field. Forming a huge 
C before the grand stand, they gave cheer after 
cheer for their school and for their hosts. The W.
6 J. men then came upon the field and returned the  
compliment. After the game, the Techites marched 
to the center of the town before dispersing.
The Game in Detail:
Ingham won the toss and took the wind. Hull 
kicked off to Wallace on the 10-yard line and he re
turned it 22 yards. Holden went around one end for
3 yards, but Wallace lost 2 at the other. Forsythe 
punted to Hatcher on Techs 50-yard line. Taylor 
failed to gain at end. W. & J. then intercepted a 
forward pass and took possession of the ball at the 
center of the field. On the next play, Tech was off
side and received a 5-yard penalty. Whitehill went 
to the 40-yard line through center and Moody made
7 yards at tackle. Then the umpire detected W. & 
J. holding and set them back to the 48-yard line. 
Whitehill made 3 yards at tackle and Forsythe 
punted to Blanchard on the goal line, but the ball 
was brought back to the 28-yard line on account of 
holding by Tech. This gave W. & J. first down. 
Forsythe went around end for 5 yards and Whitehill 
in two plunges carried it to the 15-yard line. Moody 
then tried twice and brought it 5 yards more. For
sythe attempted to drop kick a field goal, but failed. 
Hatcher decided to put the ball in play by a scrim
mage on the 25-yard line.
Taylor made 4 yards at tackle and on the next 
play punted to Whitehill on Techs 48-yard line, but 
the umpire thought he saw illegal interference and 
penalized Tech 10 yards to the 38-yard line. Wallace 
and Moody failed to gain. Hatcher then pulled down 
a forward pass on the 26-yard line. Taylor could not

in for Moody at left half. No other substitutions 
were made. Hull kicked off to McClure on the 15- 
yard line, and he advanced it 10 yards before he was 
downed. Forsythe lost 5 yards at Dyers end. On a 
fake kick play from a line shift formation, Ingham 
ran to the 37-yard line. Dyer stopped him there by 
a very pretty tackle. Although he was hurt by the 
fall, Dyer continued in the game and contributed the
most spectacular play of the day on the next down.

PREPARING A CONSTITUTION FOR CHINA.
Four years ago an edict was issued by the Dow
ager Empress of China declaring that the one hope 
for the future of the Empire lay in the granting of a 
constitution. In the preceding year a commission 
had made an extended trip through Europe and the 
United States studying the political systems of the 
Western nations. Upon their return, the commis
sioners memorialized the throne, and this edict of 
1906 was the reply to the memorial. A constitution 
was definitely promised and a tentative outline pub
lished of the course to be followed which should lead 
up, eventually, to the establishment of an Imperial 
Chinese Parliament. The basis of the constitution 
was to be found in the various imperial edicts, me
morials and collections of rules and regulations. A 
later edict, in 1908, set forth the general principles 
of the constitution, and announced that nine years 
would be devoted to preparing the people for full 
parliamentary government. Some of the steps re
quired have already been taken successfully. Pro
vincial councils have been assembled, and arrange
ments made for the summoning of the National As
sembly in Peking. This assembly will have but a 
single chamber, although it will contain the ele
ments of a two-chamber legislature. One-half of its 
members are to be representatives of the titled 
classes, the officials of the larger cities and the 
wealthy land owners. The other half will be chosen 
froir members of the various provincial councils.*

CAPT. RED HATCHER.
HATCHER HURT.
When Captain Hatcher came out of the W. & J. 
game last Saturday his arm hung limp. At first it 
was thought that the arm was broken, but subse
quent examination proved that one of the small 
bones in the wrist had been fractured. The injury, 
while not serious, will keep him out of the game for 
some time. His many friends will be glad to hear 
that the injury is not as b^d as was at first sup
posed.
MHO CLUB.
On Wednesday, November 10th, at 8 p. m., the 
Mho Club will hold its second meeting of the year in 
Room 121, Applied Science Building. It would be 
very gratifying to the officers to see as many of the 
electrical faculty and alumni as possible present at 
this meeting. The Soph Electricals should especially 
take notice since it is one of the purposes of this 
meeting to receive them into the club.

HATS OFF TO THE ROOTERS!
Last Saturday the foot-ball team journeyed down 
to Washington, Pa., to play Washington and Jeffer
son. A call was issued for an army of rooters to 
escort the warriors. As it has ever been in time of 
need, the sons of the Plaid were not found wanting. 
Three hundred howling, cheering, students, accom
panied by the Tech band, swarmed from the special 
train Saturday afternoon and took the town by 
storm, marching up and down the streets and show
ing to all that Tech was in the fight right.
Ye boosters, we take off our hats to you! It is 
the same spirit that was displayed at the W. & J. 
game which wins. The team lost, it is true; but 
by their loyalty and support, both before and after 
the game, the Carnegie rooters won a far more en
during victoryrecognition of the power and 
strength of real Carnegie spirit.
Many comments have been made by the newspa
pers and good citizens of Pittsburg upon the honest, 
unswerving loyalty of Carnegie Tech mena loyalty 
which is strong in victory, strong In defeat, a spirit 
which stands for Tech now and always. It has 
taken quite a little sacrifice on the part of the stu
dents to gain this reputation. It has meant the of
fering of time and money, blindly given; it has 
meant the swallowing of many a bitter pill with a 
smiling face; it has meant a cheer and a laugh when 
the heart has been heavy with disappointment. But 
men., it is worth it. The knowledge that we are all 
pulling together for the beloved Alma Mater is a
balm for any loss, a victory in any defeat.
Let us then keep on living up to the reputation 
which we have earned. Show those who are watch
ing us that we are made of stuff which does not give 
in to anything. Then we will have achieved some
thing really worth while, the true essence of college 
life.
AN OUTRAGE.
There is a thorn to every rose, so the poet hath 
said. It is sad that our excellent showing, the 
whole-hearted sacrifice of three hundred men, should 
be marred by a few boys who either do not know 
the proprieties or will not recognize them; who care 
so little for the honor of their school that they will 
themselves take part in dragging her fair name into 
the dust. We refer to the actions during the W. & 
J. game of a dozen or so fellows from one of the 
strongest and most excellent schools in Carnegie 
Tech. These rooters, gathering together in one 
part of the stands, sang a song which was not only 
out of place, but which was distinctly rotten. It is 
too Dad that the entire student body should have to 
suffer for the disgraceful conduct of a few who either 
do not know how to be gentlemen or do not care. 
It is up to the men of Carnegie Tech to suppress any
thing of this kind which may occur in future. See 
to it that the honor of our school is not tarnished by 
a few rowdies who are a detriment rather than a 
help to the advancement of the institution which 
they are supposed to represent.
WOODLAWN CLUB ENTERTAINS.
One of the prettiest events of the past week oc
curred Thursday evening, October 27th, when the 
Woodlawn Club gave a Halloween party at its home 
on Woodlawn avenue. Twenty couples were pres
ent. The club-house was tastefully decorated with 
a profusion of Jack-o-lanterns, corn on the stalk and 
autumn foliage and the beautiful gowns worn by the 
fair guests added a touch to the affair 
which will be long remembered. During the 
evening the hours passed swiftly in singing, dancing 
and games appropriate to the occasion. Small 
prizes were given to the successful contestants. At 
a late hour, a delightful luncheon was served in the 
club dining-room, the tables being brightened up 
with chrysanthemums, lanterns and candles. Shortly 
after midnight the party dispersed and a pleasant 
evening became but a memory.

ECONOMIC PRIZES.
In order to arouse an interest in the study of 
topics relating to commerce and industry and to 
stimulate those who have a college education to con
sider the problems of a business career, a committee 
of prominent economists have been enabled, by the 
generosity of Messrs. Hart, Schaffner and Marx, of 
Chicago, to offer in 1911 four prizes for the best 
studies in the economic field.
The prizes are divided into two classes, A and B.
Class A: A first prize of $1,000 is offered for the
best paper written by any American on some
economic question of present-day interest.
A second prize of $500 is offered for the second 
best paper.
Class B: A first prize of $300 is offered for the
best paper written by an undergraduate of any
American college on some economic question of pres
ent day interest.
A second prize of $200 is offered for the second 
best paper.
(Note: The committee reserves the right to award 
the Class A prizes to Class B contestants if the 
papers offered merit it.)
The papers are not limited as to length but should 
not be needlessly expanded. All papers must be in 
before June 1, 1911.
The following list of subjects has been approved by 
the committee. Anyone desiring to write on any 
other subject must first have his subject approved 
by the committee. List of subjects:
1. History of the rate interest in the United
States.
2. Value of protectionism to the American work
ingman.
3. Economic reasons for or against building a
deep waterway from the Lakes to the Gulf.
4. German experience in taxing the unearned in
crement from land.
5. The valuation of railways.
6. An examination of government wages statis
tics.
7. The effects of modern immigration in the .
United States.
8. The value of organized speculation.
All papers must be sent signed by a fictitious name 
and accompanied by a sealed envelope containing 
the real name of the contestant ( and his college if 
he be a Class B man).
Send all papers, communications and requests to 
J. Laurence Laughlin, Esq., University of Chicago, 
Chicago, 111.
This is an excellent chance for Tech students to 
compete for prizes which are worth while. The sub
jects are not difficult and a little research and study 
should be the means of producing a paper of merit.

APPLIED DESIGN.
The subject of the second Class A preliminary 
sketch which was made and rendered Saturday, Oc
tober 29th, was A Theological Seminary. This 
project calls for a fine group of buildings, consisting 
of two chapels, a refectory, library, museum, gym
nasium, a large lecture hall, two small lecture 
rooms, eight class rooms, reception room, residence 
for the Dean, eight houses or apartments for profes
sors and a power plant.
On the same date the second Class B EsquisseEsquisse was given out, but no drawings were sub
mitted as the problem was an exceptionally hard 
one and the students were unable to do it in the 
time allowed. The subject was A School of Fine 
Arts.
The current project in Class A Interior Decora
tion is A Louis XVI Boudoir or Drawing Room. 
This project is due November 16th.
The first freehand and modeling judgment will be 
Wednesday, November 2d. All drawings and casts 
must be submitted Tuesday, November 1st, 1910.
Mr. Hornbostel gave a very interesting lecture to 
the students of the School of Applied Design, Mon
day, Oct. 31st, on the subject of Veneering Mate
rials.
The first Class A Beaux Arts Project of this 
scholastic year was rendered Monday, October 24th. 
The subject of this problem was A Country Inn. 
Ten designs were submitted by the students in Archi
tecture. 
The first smoker of the year was held by the stu
dents of the School in the Design Building, Monday 
evening, October 24th. The evening was very pleas
antly spent. Stories were numerous and the De
sign Quartette added much to the enjoyment of the 
occasion by rendering a number of appropriate se
lections. Mr. McGoodwin told how the school had 
grown fronl a night class organized five years ago 
with a handful of students, of the founding of the 
day school the following year and of its growth to 
the present. The enrollment of the School of Ap
plied Design at present is 196, consisting of 113 day 
students and 83 night students.
The subject of the current project in Illustration 
is an attractive design for an advertisement to be 
printed in a monthly magazine.
The students in Illustration are designing a poster 
for the Foot Ball Team of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools. The purpose of the poster is to catch the 
attention of the busy public who would pass by the 
ordinary printed announcement. A member of the 
foot-ball team is posing for the class every Monday 
and Tuesday afternoons.
Why are some of our Seniors like a ball of

Couldnt ever guess! Why?
Because they are so wrapped up in themselves.

Halloween has a bad effect on some people. How
ever, we must have a good time.
Of all sad words of tongue or pen
The saddest are these, It might have been.
Ah, Muse, thou hast said well!
Cheer up! The past is gone. Let us get into the 
game Saturday and win from our Allegheny friends.
The rowdyism which was indulged in by some of 
the thoughtless ones who tried to take the Seminary 
at . < ashington by storm, is something which is to 
be deplored and should not be countenanced by 
anyone who is interested in the welfare of Tech.
The man who does one thing well is worth two of 
the Kind that does a dozen things half.
The Tech band is still on the job and is improving 
every day.
Seigle lost one sleeve of his loud plaid sweater. 
He swears that he can whip the man who dissected 
the garment.
Chic Traver, who was hurt last week by falling 
on an upright ring-stand, is back in school. He is 
compelled to use crutches for a while.
When a man begins to tell the inmost secrets of 
his heart to every passing stranger, he is either 
mentally unbalanced or drunk.
If some of the fellows about school knew the 
Alma Mater as well as they know all the latest and 
most popular songs of the day, college spirit would 
surely run high.
The cold weather is putting the finishing touch to 
the tennis season.
A depleted bank account will make a fellow stay 
home and study when ambition has long ceased to 
work its charm.
TECH DESIGN CLUB DANCE.
On Friday night, October 28th, the Tech Design 
Club entertained at a Masquerade Dance in the Con
servatory of Music, on Dithridge street.
Beside the members of the club and their many 
friends, the Deans of the Schools and the Faculty of 
the Design School, were present. Mrs. Dunkle, Mrs. 
Crombie, Mrs. H. C. Stewart, Mrs. Watson and Mrs. 
Johnston acted as chaperons.
There were about seventy-five couples, en maske, 
in the grand march. All danced masked until halfpast ten oclock and then unmasked in a Paul Jones. 
The many and varied costumes made a gay scene. 
Jack-o-Lanterns lighted the room and at the re
freshment table cider, ginger bread and sandwiches 
were served.
The Club expects to give several dances before 
the end of the school year.
FINALS IN TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
On Tuesday at 4 oclock, the finals of the fall ten
nis tournament were played. Woods and Flood 
were the contestants, and the former was returned 
winner in three straight sets, 63, 64, 63. This 
is the second school tournament that Woods has 
won. The tournament brought out a great deal of 
promising material, which will be of great aid in 
making up the school team in the spring. Mr. 
McCulloch will use the results obtained in the 
games just finished in making out the handicaps for 
the spring tournament.
ALUMNI NOTES.
Frank Henry, 09, and Joe Roura, 09, are both 
situated at Gary, Ind., where they are in the employ 
of the American Sheet and Tinplate Co.
Lowell W. Nicols, former Editor-in-Chief of the 
Tartan, has left for the Michigan woods, where he 
will spend the winter for his health.

APPLIED INDUSTRIES. 
New Lathe.
The department of mechanical drawing of this 
school has recently obtained a 16-inch swing, 6-foot 
bed, engine lathe, complete with all attachments.
This lathe is to be used for illustrating the prin
ciples of machine construction and design to the stu
dents of the drafting classes. It will also be used for 
sketching purposes.
The students of the upper drafting class will prob
ably make a complete set of detail and assembly 
drawings of this machine.
The Bradford Machine Tool Co. of Cincinnati, 
Ohio, makers of the machine, finished it with es
pecial care on account of its being used for educa
tional purposes.
A few words of thanks are due the Electric Equip
ment and Construction class for the work they did in 
rearranging the electrical equipment in the forge 
shop. The shop has a much neater appearance now.

DEFIANCE.
Behold, the word went forth one day, 
From those who oer the Freshmen sway, 
That, fitting to their verdant green,
In emerald caps they should be seen.
The Freshmen had but-to obey,
Though some were filled with deep dismay 
That, on their classic pates so fair,
This badge of greenness they must wear.
And one, Narcissus, fair to see,
(A paragon of beauty, he),
Drew himself up, with vaunting pride,
And said, in manner dignified:
What! Think you I, so young, so fair, 
So charming, and so debonair,
Would my young beauty thus demean 
To wear a little cap of green?
The scorn, the confidence, the pride
Superb, it cannot be denied.
But, oh, you Freshman, t will be seen 
Youll wear that cap of Freshman green!

SCIENCE PREP.
The Prep, class of the School of Applied Science 
held its second meeting Friday evening, October 28. 
A vacant office, that of the vice presidency was filled 
by the election of Mr. Oliver.
The class officials, viz. McKee, Oliver and Sprague, 
assisted by Knapp, were appointed to draw up a con
stitution and by-laws to be presented at the next 
meeting for approval of the class. Men were then 
chosen from each section as assistants to the Tartan 
representative.
The next class meeting will be held November 11. 
Every Prep, man should be present.
Prof. Stahl has almost convinced some of the mem
bers of the Geometry class that they know nothing 
at all. .
Hampton of Section C seems to be strong for 
class spirit. It would be better for the school if more 
of the preps would take the same stand.
Members of the class in Physics are handicapped 
by the inability of the Storeroom to supply them with 
text books.
PLEBE CLASS
The Plebe Class football team has been practic
ing for some time and has been doing excellent work. 
The team is desirous of playing a few games this 
fall, and hope that some of the other classes are 
starting teams.
When the gym is ready for use a basketball team 
will be organized. Many have suggested that a 
series of games be played between the different 
classes.

FIRST TECH COUPLE.
The announcement of the wedding of Fred I. Gas
ton, 09, Metallurgist, and Elizabeth E. Sheets, 09, 
M. M. C. S., brings out the noteworthy fact that Mr. 
and Mrs. Gaston have the honor of being the first 
Tech couple. Since the first class was graduated 
in 1908, quite a number of Techites have entered 
into the matrimonial estate, but we record for the 
first time a union within our gates. We all join in 
wishing the happy pair a most successful and pros
perous future. Just let us all sing the first verse of 
the Alma Mater as follows:
Let all our voices now be raised 
In song to fill the air;
And all our hearts with music praise 
This first real Tech School pair.

NEW BULLETIN BOARDS.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs have secured nice 
new bulletin boards for their own use exclusively. 
These boards have been hung in the hallways of the 
Science and Industries buildings and will be used for 
all announcements concerning the two clubs. The 
placing of the boards is an improvement over the 
old way of sticking up any old kind of a sign on the 
large School bulletins. The new bulletins are neat 
and effective and should prove of value to the two 
clubs.
