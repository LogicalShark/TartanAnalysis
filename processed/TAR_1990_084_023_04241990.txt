As Dean Elizabeth Bailey pre
sided over the celebration of 
GSIAs 40th anniversary last 
weekend, many in the audience 
wondered how long she would 
remain dean of the college.
Rumors spread through the 
college last week concerning her 
future at GSIA, as well as that.of 
Deputy Dean Timothy McGuire, 
and it appears that neither will 
hold their positions much longer.
Bailey has been dean of the 
college and a professor of econom
ics since 1983. Previously she had 
been comissioner of the Civil 
Aeornautics Board, and she is a
member of the boards of National 
Westminster Bancorp Inc., CSX, 
Philip Morris, College Retirement 
Equity Fund, and Honeywell.
An anonymous memo entitled 
An Open Letter to GSIA Fac
ulty, Staff, Students, Alumni, and 
CMU Administration and Trus
tees was placed in faculty mail
boxes last Monday which referred 
to the termination of Dean Eliza
beth Baileys appointment.
The memo indicated that an 
acting dean and a chair of a dean 
search committee had been se
lected. The memo described the 
search committee chair as one 
senior political economist who 
served on the Presidential Search

Uncertainty

deans future
By FARRON W. LEVY

Student Senate passed a mo
tion recommending an increase 
in the Student Activities Fee from 
the current $80 to $100 per year 
last Tuesday, setting in motion a 
referendum vote which must be 
passed by students in the upcom
ing Student Government elections 
this week. If passed by the stu
dent body, the measure must 
receive final approval from the 
Board of Trustees to be enacted.
If [the referendum] passes then 
it goes to the Board of Trustees, 
said Associate Dean for Student 
Affairs Lois Cox, and Ive never 
known them to say no, but they do 
have that power.
The last increase in the fee was 
in the fall of 1988, from $60 to 
$80. Now, just two years later, 
the fee may be raised again. This 
raises concern for some, since the
Student Activities Fee was origi
nally designed to be increased 
every four years.
Student Senate Chair Chris 
Neighbor said that the increase is 
needed now because the increase 
cycle is at its end. Last spring the 
Funding and Recognition Com
mittee decided to wipe out a ten 
year surplus because of an in
crease in need demonstrated by 
student organizations, he said. 
The Activities Fee always had a 
surplus, but an increase in need 
has absorbed that.
Neighbor said that if the in
crease is passed in.elections to
morrow and Thursday, the cycle 
should begin again and another 
surplus will be built up.
Many criticize the prudence of 
Student Senate in allocating 
money. However, CJox disagrees. 
The students have allocated the 
money wisely, she said, its just

Gays are prohibited from entering ROTC because cadets are 
required to enter military service after graduation. The military 
has deemed gays unfit for service.

Tartan Assistant News Editor
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Miirphy and Vice President for 
Enrollment WilUam Elliott are plan
ning official action in protesting the 
Reserve Officer Training Corps 
exclusionary policy towards gay 
students
The plan is to send a letter;- said 
Murphy. We are working on [the 
letter] now to urge ROTC to con
sider this [gay exclusion] policy, 
highlighting how the policy differs 
from CMUs policy of nondiscrimi
nation.
Copies of the letter will be sent to 
the leaders of ROTC, the Secretary 
of Defense, and other universities
that have ROTC installations. The 
purpose, said Elliott, is to bring 
about change by changing attitudes. 
Weve tried to set an example and 
weve got to take a leadership role.
ROTC provides incomparable 
benefits to students nationwide. It 
acts as an important source of fi
nancial aid, provides an open outlet 
for students who wish to pursue a 
military career, and produces edu
cated and motivated officers for the 
nations armed forces.
However, many university cam
puses have a serious problem with 
the program. According to Major 
Joe Padilla of U.S. Army Public 
Affairs at the Pentagon, Depart
ment of Defense policy is that 
homosexuality is incompatible with
military service. Thus, gays that 
wish to benefit from the ROTC 
program are barred from doing so.
In his own letter to Secretary of 
Defense Richard Cheney, MIT 
Provost John Deutch protested the 
militarys policy after a MIT stu
dent was dismissed from ROTC for 
being an avowed gay and required 
to repay his entire scholarship 
award.
The contradiction between the 
universitys principle of non-discrimination against individuals on 
the basis of sexual orientation, and 
the presence of a ROTC that does 
discriminate, he wrote, cannot 
exist on the campuses indefinitely.

CMU, Bosch announce institute
By DANIEL DE GRANDPRE
Tartan Staffwriter
Bosch, a West German corporation, will 
donate $15 million to Carnegie Mellon 
University to establish an institute for 
studies in international management.
The Carnegie Bosch Institute for Ap
plied Studies in International Manage
ment is a partnership between Carnegie 
Mellons business school, the Graduate 
School of Industrial Administration 
(GSIA), and the Bosch Group, an interna
tional manufacturing firm headquartered 
in Stuttgart, West Germany.
Hans L. Merkle, managing partner of 
Robert Bosch Industrietreuhand KG, the 
governing body of the Bosch Group, said 
that the institute will be used to support
research projects relating to international 
management problems.
The institute will be dedicated to ex
ploring what issues are important in in
ternational management and how man
agers should deal effectively with them in 
a global environment, said Merkle. Our 
funding ofthe institute represents a major 
commitment to a better understanding of 
critical issues in international manage
ment.
Richard Cyert will become the first 
president ofthe Carnegie Bosch Institute

Shuttles future 
remains unclear
By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The future of Carnegie Mellons 
shuttle service remains uncertain even 
after meetings last Friday that were 
hoped to move University officials 
closer to a decision on what changes 
should be made to the shuttles route.
There was no resolution per se, 
said Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy. My gut feeling is that the 
route is not going to change. The likely 
outcome is that there will be continued 
shuttle service, possibly with an ex
panded route.

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
SEAC Spring Carnival 
booth marks Earth Day
Carnegie Mellons Student Environmental Action Coali
tion booth at Spring Carnival was just a small part of the 
larger celebration ofthe 20th anniversary of Earth Day going 
on across Pittsburgh over the weekend.
The SEAC booth had handouts, t-shirts, and posters de
signed to spread information. SEAC members solicited sig
natures for a petition aimed at the Pittsburgh municipal 
government attempting to spur them towards a city-wide re
cycling program. The booth also offered ready-made post
cards, addressed to City Councilman Michael Coyne, urging 
him to vote to stiffen the Clean Air Act.
Spurred by increasing national concern over the state of 
the environment and what can be done to stop the ongoing 
damage, Earth Day was meant to raise consciousness about 
the environment and about methods to save the earth from 
further harm.
In Pittsburgh, Earth Day was celebrated at Point Park, be
ginning with a sunrise service and ending with a concert by 
The Clarks. In between were state representatives Tom 
Murphy and Allen Kulkovich; Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie 
Masloff; and Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey. Also 
speaking were Diana Steck, from the Citizens Clearinghouse 
for Hazardous Waste; and Michael Wright, director of safety 
and health, United Steelworkers of America.

Center for Gounod Studies
The new Institute for Gounod Studies at Carnegie Mellon, 
in honor of composer Charles Gounod, will be initiated with 
activities held in conjunction with a meeting of the Allegheny 
County Chapter of the American Musicological Society this 
Saturday and Sunday.
The symposium, which is seen as a forerunner to future 
conferences, performances, and scholarly exchange, will give 
musicologists the opportunity to share their work through 
performances, papers, and other creative presentations.
According to Music Department Head Marilyn Taft Tho
mas, the start of this new research endeavor will give our 
faculty and students opportunities ot more closely examine 
the significance of Gounods influence and his works.
The new Institute has been formed in cooperation with the 
Sorbonne in Paris. Founder Dr. Kenneth Langevin, a music 
history professor of the Music Department and a Gounod 
scholar, has formed an international advisory board which is 
composed of noted music experts.
The weekend will be highlighted by performances of some 
of Gounods lesser-known works, such as his third string 
quartet, which will be performed by the acclaimed Cuarteto 
Latinoamericano at 11:30 am on Sunday at Mellon Institute. 
The Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble, conducted by Jon 
Mitchell, will perform Gounods Petite Symphonic at 8 pm on 
Sunday at Temple Rodef Shalom.
Langevin says that this initial symposium and set of per
formances are the beginning of the Institutes look at Gounod 
and other composers with the use of new technology and re
search tools.
University announces 
commencement information
Each year at the time of Commencement, the Public 
Relations office sends a news release about an interesting 
graduate to the news media in hopes that that media will 
come to campus to interview the graduate and report on the 
commencement ceremony. If you know of such a student, 
please send a message to ed47@andrew describing what you 
think is interesting or unique about him or her.
Commencement information packets, including five

WORLD NEWS
U.S. delays short 
range missile 
deployment
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
Bush administration, responding 
to a lessening of tensions in Eu
rope, is indefinitely postponing 
the production of new short-range 
nuclear missiles that were to be 
deployed in West Germany, U.S. 
officials said last week.
The 88 new launchers for the 
missile system, 36 of which were 
to be controlled by the United 
States and the others by West 
Germany, Britain, and the Neth
erlands, were designed for tar
geting East Germany.
The tentative U.S. goal was to 
begin deploying the new shortrange nuclear missiles in 1995 to 
replace the current mixture of 
nuclear-armed and conventional 
Lance missiles.
But East Germany is rapidly 
moving out of the Soviet sphere 
and preparingfor union with West 
Germany. It is no longer perceived 
as a threat to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization countries.
The current arsenal of Lances 
will remain in West Germany, 
however.
Those with nuclear warheads 
have a range of about 75 miles, 
and the non-nuclear weapons are 
designed to hit targets within 45
miles. The new launchers were 
intended to have a range of about 
280 miles.
The present system is a viable 
deterrent through the year 2000, 
even though the Army would have 
liked to start deployment of new 
Lances in 1995, a U.S. official 
said.
Soviet forces 
seize Party 
printing plant
MOSCOW (DJ)  Soviet sol
diers, some armed with trun
cheons and assault rifles, forced 
their way into a Communist Party 
printing plant in the center of 
Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, 
said witness Angele Guobiene.
The soldiers beat some of the 
several dozen armed civilians who 
have been on guard for several 
weeks.
Guobiene, who works for the 
trade union journal Darbas Ir 
Poilsis, which is printed at the 
plant, said some people were hurt 
but it was not known how many 
or whether any of them were hos
pitalized.
Police didnt allow reporters 
who arrived after the incident to 
enter the building. Soldiers were 
visible behind a black iron gate in 
the courtyard of the building and 
some workers barricaded them
selves near printing presses and 
looked out from open secondand 
third-floor windows.
A crowd of about 150 people 
gathered on the street to watch.
Soldiers began occupying build
ings in Vilnius a month ago, 
among them the republics Com
munist Party headquarters and a 
plant that prints the republics 
newspapers. This plant prints the 
trade union journal, a humor 
magazine and other non-political 
magazines.
Soldiers also beat some Lithu
anians last month as they rounded 
up army deserters.
This crackdown came amid an 
energy embargo the Kremlin has 
imposed on Lithuania in an effort 
to force it to renounce its March
11 declaration of independence.
Republicans at 
odds over U.S. 
policy on Israel
WASHINGTON (DJ)Repub
lican divisions over U.S. policy 
toward Israel broke into the open 
in an unusual exchange of testy 
letters between Senate Minority 
Leader Robert Dole and younger 
conservatives in the House GOP 
leadership.
In recent months, Dole has been 
increasingly outspoken in chal
lenging U.S. aid to Israel, and the
tension yesterday reflected 'a , 
growing concern among Republi
cans that the harshness of his 
tone is hurting the party going 
into the fall elections. Among his 
own Jewish backers, his published 
comments during a recent trip to 
the Mideast have provoked con-, 
cem.
The recent flurry of letters pit
ted Dole most directly against 
House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich.' .. 
And the conservative support for" 
Israel reflects an alliance that 
grew stronger under the Reagan 
administration. The 1988 GOf* 
platform was striking in its sup
port of pro-Israel positions.
While Dole has won praise for",- 
his willingness to question the 
pro-Israel lobby, he has hurt 
himself by seeming to reverse his 
positions from one month to the 
next. His initial proposal to im
pose a five percent cut in foreign 
aid to Israel and other major re
cipient countries appeared hast
ily prepared and came even as he 1 
was signaling support for new aid 
to help build housing for Soviet , 
Jews in Israel. He has since moved 
away from a proposal to help fir. 
nance such housing. After co
sponsoring a pro-Israel resolution 
calling for a unified Jerusalem, 
Dole now says the legislation is 
harmful to peace in the region 
and his own support of it was a 
mistake.
? NATIONAL NEWS
U.S. officials pin 
hopes to trade 
negotiations
WASHINGTON (DJ)  U.S. 
trade representative Carla Hills 
said that if the bilateral negotia
tions with Japan arent success
ful in resolving the trade prob
lem, the United States will decide 
by next April 18 what steps it 
should take under the section 301 
provisions of the U.S. Trade Law 
against imports from Japan.
Allied-Signal Inc. filed a trade 
complaint on March 5, alleging 
that the Japan has engaged in 
practices aimed at excluding sales 
of U.S. amorphous metals in 
Japan.
Allied-Signal also charged that 
the Japanese government has 
blocked its attempts to license its 
technology to Japanese compa
nies.
Hills was required, under the 
1988 trade act, to accept or reject 
the Allied-Signal trade complaint 
by late last week.
However, she did neither of 
these things.
Instead, she persuaded AlliedSignal to withdraw the complaint 
temporarily while U.S. govern
ment officials try to resolve the 
trade dispute through bilateral 
negotiations with the Japanese 
government.
Hills has used similar tactics in 
dealing with trade complaints 
from other U.S. industries about 
discriminatory and unfair 
trade practices of other govern
ments.
Defense budget 
compromise 
proposed
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee said that 
President Bushs 1991 military 
budget must be slashed, but not 
as severely as proposed by the 
Democratic-controlled House 
Budget Committee.
Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
proposed defense spending of $297 
billion for the fiscal year begin
ning October 1, $1.5 billion more 
than the committee approved. 
Bush has proposed a $303 billion 
defense budget.
I believe this range is a realis
tic and responsible target, Nunn 
said in a speech on the Senate 
floor.
Nunn proposed limiting spend
ing on the Strategic Defense Ini
tiative to about $4 billion, the 
amount Congress appropriated 
for the anti-missile shield last 
year.
The Armed Services chairman 
also called for delaying the 
Pentagons plans to move the 
multiple-warhead, MX nuclear 
missile from fixed silos to rail
road cars.
In the first element of the new 
military strategy  nuclear de
terrence  these and other ac
tions could save on the order of $3 
billion to $3.5 billionin fiscal 1991 
and between $20 and $30 billion 
over the next five years, Nunn 
said.
House Democrats plan to bring 
their proposed $1.24 trillion 1991 
budget to the floor next week in 
what looms as a test of their plan 
to begin slashing tens of billions 
of dollars in military spending.
Americans stand 
ready to save 
environment
NEW YORK (DJ)  As major 
new clean-air legislation makes 
its way through Congress, Ameri
cans are increasingly being asked 
to make sacrifices in the name of 
the environment. And according 
to a new nationwide Wall Street 
JournallNBC News poll, a major
ity say they are by and large will
ing to make those tough tradeoffs 
in order to have a cleaner world. 
In the wake of Sundays 20th 
Anniversary celebration of Earth 
Day, people are far more likely to 
be worrying than celebrating.
The survey, covering 1,001 re
spondents, indicates that a full 
two-thirds of registered voters 
think the environment is in worse 
shape today than it was 20 years 
ago. By an even more overwhelm
ing ratio of six to one, voters say 
they want to protect the environ
ment even if it means they will 
have to pay higher prices. That is 
a sharp change from 1981, when 
the ratio was only five to four.
Americans are playing for 
keeps when it comes to the envi
ronment, say pollsters Peter Hart 
and Robert Teeter, who conducted
the sampling for the Journal and 
NBC. Every indicator in this 
survey suggests that voters care 
about the environment, that they 
are personally making efforts to 
protect the environment, and that 
they are willing to change their 
behavior and purchasing habits 
in order to ensure that we have a 
cleaner world.
More than eight of ten, for in
stance, say they are willing to 
separate their trash for recycling, 
give up plastic fast-food contain
ers and superfluous packaging to 
reduce waste, and get their cars 
inspected and tuned up yearly to 
cut tailpipe emissions. By three 
to one, voters say they would favor 
a ban on disposable diapers.
In addition, 68 percent would 
be willing to pay up to $600 more 
for a less-polluting car; 57 per
cent favor stricter air-pollution 
requirements even if these added 
$10 a month to their electricity 
bill; 57 percent also would favor 
requiring urban commuters to 
ride public transportation to work 
once a week; and just over half, 51 
percent, would be willing to see 
limits placed on the number of 
large cars that could be produced.
Of course, people might have 
second thoughts about some of 
the tradeoffs if actually faced with 
the prospect of having to make 
them. Forinstance, the poll found 
that even 56 percent of those with 
children under age three favor a 
ban on disposable diapers, a fig
ure that might drop significantly 
if this became a real possibility.
There are limits to peoples good 
environmental intentions. The 
Journal/NBC poll shows that 59 
percent oppose closing polluting 
factories if that would put people 
out of work, while voters are 
evenly split over a 20-cent-a-gallon increase for cleaner-burning 
fuel, a prospect that could be a 
reality for the nine smoggiest U.S. 
cities under the clean-air bill 
passed by the Senate.
By far the most difficult trade
off, in the poll as in peoples lives, 
is the one between pollution and 
jobs. The Senate legislation would 
force industry to spend, by one 
estimate, up to $21.5 billion a 
year by the year 2005 to clean up 
the atmosphere, and it would 
almost certainly cost thousands 
of jobs in coal mines and possibly 
factories.
The Journal!NBC poll found
that many voters havent yet fd-UUl 
cused on the clean-air legislation 
and the tradeoffs it will require; 
only about four in 10 voters have 
heard or read about the bill so far. 
Yetthe intensity of environmental, 
feeling is such that theres little 
evidence more attention to th$V 
bill will make them change theft *. 
minds. In fact, of those who do 
know about the bill, 40 percent 
think it doesnt go far enougli; 
while 33 percent think it has about 
the right balance and only 6 per. 
cent think it goes too far.
Conservation*191(1technology 
questioned
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Oppo
nents ofthe fuel economy increase,' 1 
including the auto industry, ar
gue that technology isnt avail
able to achieve the proposed stan
dards, that only small cars would 
be able to meet such stringent 
fuel economy levels, and that 
consumer choice and auto jobs 
would suffer as a result.
A more comprehensive bill is 
currently being considered by the 
Senate Energy and Natural Re
sources panel. The measure, in
troduced by Senator Timothy 
Wirth (D-Colo.) was recently re
vised to gain the support of the 
panels leaders, Senator J. Ben
nett Johnston (D.-La.) and Sena
tor James McClure (R.-Idaho), 
greatly enhancing its chances of 
moving out of the committee.
The legislation calls for stabili
zation of carbon dioxide emissions ( 
by 2000 as a national goal and a 
study of the feasibility of attain
ing a 20 percent reduction in those 
emissions by 2005.
The Bush administration ar
gues that a 20 percent emissions 
reduction isnt technologically 1 
feasible and would lead to a dra
matic reduction of American liv
ing standards, possibly including 
restrictions on automobile usage.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 April 19903
Presidential candidate finds no contest
By KRISTEN HENLEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Kishore Rao, a junior IM major and 
THStaXi brother, is the sole candidate for 
thejposition of Student Government Presi
dent, Student Senate Chair Chris Neigh
bor announced last Tuesday night.
barring an unforeseen campaign by a 
write-in candidate, Rao will be elected by 
the student body Wednesday and Thurs
day in the elections held outside Doherty 
Hall.
Rao, the only student to turn in a peti
tion for the position, spoke at a roundrobjn press conference Wednesday night 
broadcast on WRCT and co-sponsored by 
The Tartan. The discussion was origi
nally scheduled as a debate for all the 
candidates, but the format was changed 
wbgn only one candidate was validated.
The on-air discussion was mediated by 
senior Josh Ruben, who gave time for 
each of the panelists  current Student 
Government President Mark Mittelhauser, Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy, and Tartan Editor-In-Chief 
Howdy Pierce  to ask Rao questions.
According to Rao, the quality of student 
 lifejvill be the key to the direction of his 
administration. Acknowledging that it has 
been a popular buzzword with regard to 
campus life over the last year, he said he
feels that there are still many issues that 
need to be investigated  most of them 
support systems such as the health 
center, shuttle services, retail stores, and 
dining services.
Rao pinned his hopes for a successful 
administration on an effective committee 
system that involves many students. As a 
means to address many of the problems, 
he plans to revive and institutionalize 
committees and networks of committees, 
both combined faculty, student, and ad
ministrative committees, and student 
committees to investigate issues and 
mobilize ideas and solutions. In particu
lar, he said he would like to stress the 
need for departmental advisory commit
tees chosen by the students.
Responding to a question about inter
national awareness, Rao emphasized the 
need to integrate the comparatively small 
population here at CMU with the larger 
global community. To do this, he said that 
students need to gain experience with 
other countries. He hopes to broaden the 
opportunities available for foreign study, 
internships, and cooperative educational 
opportunities.
Rao said he supports a proposal intro
duced by past Student Government Presi
dent Andrew Robitshek that would allow 
students to take a lighter course load 
while at Carnegie Mellon by providing for
a free fifth year of study.
If the University really has this com
mitment to education, to interdisciplinary 
study, [and] to personal growth ... this is 
the ideal opportunity without diluting the 
professional and technical requirements, 
he said.
Other questions addressed the lack of 
women in leadership positions and the 
general void of women and other minori
ties in administrative and faculty posi
tions. To these questions, Rao expressed 
enthusiasm for encouraging more involve
ment through recruitment of more female 
students. He said he feels that if the op
portunities are presented to the groups in 
question, that the response will be favor
able.
He also encourages more student com
mittees and events to promote diversity 
on the personal level, with the belief that 
the most progress will be created from 
the ground up.
When asked to discuss the strengths of 
the student body, Rao emphasized the 
many resources at CMU because of the 
strength of the individual colleges. [There 
is] a lot of energy and talent in students, 
he said, but they dont have time or hope 
that they can affect change. We need to 
have programs to tap this. Raos entire 
platform, in its many forms, seems geared 
to address this.

Twenty Student Senate seats 
are-up for grabs in this weeks 
Student Government Elections. 
However, there are very few grab
bers: only six valid petitions were 
submitted to Senate by last 
Tuesdays deadline. These six 
naiEes are the only ones that will 
appear as official candidates on 
election ballots:
2 (FA: Chris Neighbor (3 seats 
available)
CJT: Guy Spivack, Brad Wyatt 
(4 s^ats available)
GrSIA: Michael Loomis (3 seats 
available)
- H&SS: W. Stewart Barnes, 
'Hyun Shin (3 seats available) 
Tiie low number of people run
ning for positions has caused 
can^pus leaders to examine the 
reas.on the number of students 
o>vho demonstrate interest is so. 
*/ow. Is the low turnout due to 
apathy in the student body, or are 
there other problems that hinder 
people from running for office?
Kishore Rao, the sole official 
candidate for the Student Govemrpent Presidency, commented 
on the low turnout for the elec
tions in an round robin press con
ference which was co-sponsored 
by The Tartan and WRCT and 
broadcast live on WRCT last 
Wednesday. Students at Carne
gie Mellon have become convinced 
that there is not an opportunity 
for them to affect change in their 
environment, he said. We need 
to let students know that if there 
is a problem, there is a means, 
channel, or method to address 
and hopefully resolve it.
Rao called on Senate to give 
[students] the backing and sup
port and the energy to get in
volved.
' Dean of Student AffairsMichael 
Murphy attributes the lack of' 
candidates to extreme satisfac
tion or extreme frustration and 
the rigorous academic orientation 
of the University. According to 
Murphy, however, students are 
as active here as at any other like 
institution. This is particularly 
true, he claims, in activities and 
intramurals.
Outgoing president Mark Mittelhauser attributes CMUs rig
orous academic program and a 
dearth of pressingissues with the 
apparent apathy. He explains that 
thenarrowness of the curriculum 
creates social stratification which 
limits the interest of students in

As a potential result, students

Student Senate Chair Chris 
Neighbor cant put a fmger on the 
cause of the lack of interest, but 
sees it as a formidable issue for

next year will be a reorganizational year for the Senate with 
many internal issues to re-evaluate or change.

An accident which occurred 
during the dismantling of a booth 
and two citations issued for pos
session of alcohol in fraternities 
were among the few unpleasant 
events that marred this years 
Spring Carnival weekend.
While striking the booth of Phi 
Kappa Theta on Sunday after
noon, freshman Russell Elkin was 
struck in the head by lumber 
which fell from the roof of the 
booth.
Carnegie Mellon Police reported 
that a portion of the top section of 
the booth was loosened and fell; 
one board struck Elkin on the 
back of the head, and an attached 
board pinched his right wrist.
Elkin was taken to Presbyte
rian University Hospital, where 
he was treated and later released. 
According to Phi Kap President 
Dave Willis, Elkins injuries, al
though bloody, were not serious.
In an incident on the Fraternity 
Quadrangle Sunday, two frater
nities were issued internal cita
tions for possession of alcohol. 
Campus Police discovered mem
bers of Sigma Nu and Pi Kappa 
Alpha drinking alcohol on or near
the porch areas of their respec
tive houses.
According to Sigma Nu brother 
Brad Wyatt, the other Sigma Nu 
brothers were in the process of 
poleing their buggy chair, Jini 
Shaw, along Morewood Avenue 
when Campus Police arrived. In 
poleing, a traditional post-race 
activity, the legs of the houses 
buggy chair are tied together at 
his ankles and suspended upsidedown from a pole, and then all the 
brothers douse him with water. 
Upon arriving at the scene, a 
Campus Police officer attempted 
to convince the brothers to re
lease Shaw.
I love this  its not hazing, 
said Shaw, according to Wyatt.
Wyatt said that the officer told 
the brothers to stop throwing 
water at Shaw. ASigma Nu pledge 
then said that if he couldnt throw 
water at the buggy chair, then he 
would throw it at the ground. But 
when he threw the water, the 
Campus Police officer absorbed 
the brunt of it.
Campus Police then issued the 
fraternity an internal citation for 
public drunkenness.
Pika officials could not be 
reached for comment on Sunday 
night.

4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 April 1990
Panel discusses international management at GSIA anniversary
By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
; A Graduate School of Industrial Ad
ministration panel discussed Friday the 
Carnegie Bosch Institute and how it 
would affect issues of international 
management. Panelists for the discus
sion, which took place in the Mellon 
Institutes Auditorium, also addressed 
management students concerning what 
message they should take with them 
into their careers.
The discussion, a feature of GSIAs 
40th anniversary celebration, was en
titled Challenges in International 
Management.
Chaired by GSIA Dean Elizabeth
Bailey, the panel included Marcus Bierich, chair of the board of management of 
the Robert Bosch Group, which will join 
with Carnegie Mellon to establish the 
Carnegie Bosch Institute; Carnegie 
Mellon President Richard M. Cyert, who 
will serve as the Institutes first presidentafter his retirement from Carne
gie Mellons Presidency at the end of 
June; C. Michael Armstrong, senior vice 
president of IBM and chair and presi
dent of the IBM World Trade Corpora
tion; Michael A. Miles, chair and CEO of 
Kraft General Foods; Edson W. Spencer, 
chair of the Commission on U.S.-Japan 
Relations for the 21st Century; and 
Konrad M. Weis, president and CEO of 
Bayer USA Inc.
One of the messages any business 
school has to leave with its graduates is 
that fixing competitiveness is one thing, 
but maintaining it is much more diffi
cult, said Spencer. Any graduate of any 
business school has got to understand 
that if theyre going to make it in the real 
world, theyve got to be entrepreneurial, 
theyve got to take risks, and theyve got 
to manage change.
Spencer also emphasized that students 
of international management should be 
multilingual and virtually multicultu
ral, with a thorough knowledge of other 
nations language, culture, and history. 
All business students should have 
knowledge of the history, religious back
ground, origins, and philosophy of an
other nation, he said.
Many of the panelists stressed the need 
to operate with a foreign countrys na
tionals rather than to try to displace or 
replace them.
Strategic alliances are very impor
tant, said Cyert. As you have a strate
gic alliance with a company or compa
nies in a country, it makes it easier to 
hire good people  nationals recruiting 
nationals.... As we see increased inter
nationalization, the concept of foreign
ers will be erased.
Another topic which was discussed was 
the question of international business 
ethics. Weis gave as an example the 
recent situation involving his company, 
Bayer USA, and its decision to decline to
supply materials which would be used in 
the production of nerve gas.
World-wide policies should apply, as 
long as they dont violate regional or 
local law, he said.
Spencer said that it is the responsibil
ity of the faculty of a business school'to 
foster discussion of what is right and 
what is wrong in the business world.
Cyert said that for the first few years, 
the Carnegie Bosch Institute ideally will 
concentrate on having research dealing 
with a few specific themes, and, over 
time, should be able to select very impor
tant issues and to get very good research
ers to work on those problems.
The question of how to organize re
search is important, he said.
Crime and Incident ReportInstitute announced
4/14 THREAT
ENING GES
TURE, 12:51 am. A 
woman driving 
behind Hamburg 
Hall called Campus 
Police and said that she was 
threatened by a white male wav
ing an eight-foot tree branch. She 
said that there was no mistaking 
this as a threatening gesture. The 
male actor, who had been work
ing on a buggy in the garages, 
said that the victim actually came 
close to hitting him as she drove 
up to the stop sign, at which point 
he countered with the gestures. 
At no time did he hit the victims 
car or make any other threats or 
gestures.
4/14 THEFT AND RECOV
ERY, 8:09 am. A Carnegie Mel
lon student reported that his 
clothes, valued at $150, had been 
stolen from the washer in the 
Donner Hall laundry room. The 
missing clothing consisted of five 
or six shirts, sizes unknown, and 
several pairs of socks. The cloth
ing was later discovered outside 
the students door.
4/15 THEFT AND RECOVMinutes of 
Student Sen
ate meeting of 
April 17,
1990.
Senators 
present: Bates (late), Brockmann 
(late), Conard, Dean, Kadesh, 
Kaufman, Keleher, Kochar, 
Lenga, Lewis, Loomis, Neighbor, 
Ruben, Rubinstein, Sanda, 
Schaeffer, Spivack, Warner, 
Witbrock, Wyatt, Venable, 
Zucker.
Senators absent: Betts, 
DiVito, Garber.
Ex-Officios present: Fraser, 
Ginsburg, Sims, Dean Witchner.
Corrections of last weeks 
minutes: Venable was present.
Audience Participation: 
Someone asked if KSAs funds 
were frozen. F&R did not freeze 
them. Perhaps Student Affairs 
could provide information.
Special Business: The discus
sion about funding Greek Council 
was opened. The issue of gay dis
crimination in fraternities was 
raised. A motion was made to 
limit discussion to 15 minutes, 
with five objections. It failed: 9 
for, 10 opposed. A motion was 
then passed limiting the debate 
to five minutes per speaker. The 
plans are for Senate to fund Greek 
Dry Rush. Rush events are open 
to the entire campus and would 
discriminate against no one. The 
sign-up fee from the Word is for 
PANHELs organizational fees. 
PANHEL is more structured than 
CFP. The motion to fund Dry 
Greek Rush passed, 15 for, 3 
opposed, 3 abstentions.
Activities Board: General 
meetings are held every Monday 
at 8:00 in Skibo 201.
Student Dormitory Council: 
SDC is sponsoring a white water 
rafting trip on Saturday, April 
28.
Student Senate Chair  
Chris Neighbor: Elections are 
on the 25th and 26th of this month. 
Petition showing is very poor. 
Neighbor urges everyone to reERY, 2:47 pm. Campus Police 
officers noticed two white males 
hiding behind the bushes in front 
of Warner Hall. Suddenly, they 
ran across Forbes Avenue, carry
ing two office-type swivel chairs. 
The officers pursued the actors 
until they reached the driveway 
of Pi Kappa Alpha, where the 
actors dropped the chairs. The 
actors were seen entering Kappa 
Sigma fraternity by way of the 
quad. The chairs were retrieved 
and brought to Security.
4/15 SUSPICIOUS PERSON, 
4:55 pm. Campus Police received 
a call from a man who had been 
approached on the corner of Fifth 
Avenue and Craig Street by a 
black male wearing a maroon 
jacket and blue canvas work 
pants. The actor told the victim 
that he was from Uniontown and 
needed money for bus fare to bring 
his wife and child to Childrens 
Hospital. The victim did not give 
the actor any money. The actor 
was later stopped and identified 
by Campus Police and said that 
he was soliciting money because 
he was broke, not because he 
needed bus fare for his wife and
cruit people for write-in cam
paigns so that there will be a full 
Senate next year.
Academic Affairs  Seth 
Kadesh: At the last meeting, the 
following items were discussed: 
improving communication with 
SACs and the five year proposi
tion. The committee discussed the 
possibility of requiring additional 
courses for fifth-year students. 
Labeling transcripts was also 
discussed. Also discussed was 
compiling the comments from 
FCE forms to create an uncen
sored book for students to have so 
as to learn what their peers 
thought of faculty members.
Campus AffairsBill Lewis: 
The committee met with Student 
Affairs to talk about smoking 
areas and the continuing poster
ing problem. They are still look
ing for the smoking areas. And 
student posters will take prece
dence over commercial ones.
Funding and Recognition 
Nicole Brockmann: Tuesday 
night is the budget hearing. As a 
result of the Buggy Funding 
Committee meeting, an amend
ment was brought forth to change 
the following provision of the 
Fiscal Policy: v. Student Senate 
will only consider funding a buggy 
for a student organization once 
every three years. The amend
ment reads:
1. An independent organization 
must provide at least 10% of its 
buggy maintenance budget each 
year from non-subsidy income.
2. Student Senate will only 
consider funding a new buggy for 
independent organizations once 
every three years. These organi
zations must provide, at that time, 
at least 25% of the cost of the 
buggy from non-subsidy income.
A motion was made to table this 
issue for one week, with four ob
jections. Someone from the Sweep
stakes committee was not in on 
these decisions and suggestions. 
The motion to table passed, 
11-8-1.
A resolution was also put forth
child. He was told to leave the 
area and not to return by Campus 
Police.
4/15 MEDICAL, 5:32 pm. A 
man who was riding a bicycle ran 
into a light standard near the 
tennis courts. Campus Police and 
student EMS units responded. 
The man said that he was coming 
down the hillside by the tennis 
courts on the side of the Cut and 
was apparently going too fast 
when he lost control of the bike 
and it went out from under him. 
He did not remember hitting the 
light standard. He was not wear
ing a helmet at the time of the 
accident and suffered a cut under 
his right eye, a bruise on his fore
head, a sore left wrist, and 
scratches on his right knee.
4/16 THEFT, 4:15 pm. A Car
negie Mellon student reported 
that his camera and case, valued 
at $300, had been stolen from 
inside a green canvas shoulder 
bag in Porter Hall. The camera is 
a Nikoi) Zoom Touch 500 35 mm 
camera, serial number unknown, 
inside a black form-fitted case.
4/20 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 
1:27 am. A Campus Police officer
on increasing the Activities Fee. 
Two points were key: 1. should 
this go on the ballots as a referen
dum, and 2. does Student Senate 
support the increase. The refer
endum would explain the increase 
in the fee from $40 to $50 per 
semester. The Board of Trustees 
will make their final decision on 
independent of the results of the 
referendum. But the referendum 
is the only way to get any infor
mation from students to the Trus
tees. A concern was voiced that 
grad students do not always re
ceive the full benefit from their 
share of the Activities Fee. A 
motion was passed accepting the 
referendum at a vote of 18 for, 2 
opposed, and 0 abstentions.
Public Relations  Mike 
Keleher: PR will be postering 
heavily for the upcoming election 
and the referendum.
Rules  Michael Witbrock: 
Rules met and discussed the idea 
of funding Greek organizations. 
There are some provisions in the 
F&R section of the Constitution 
that will need close examination 
and possible amending.
New Business: A motion was 
made to have Senate endorse the 
increase in the Activities Fee. 
Some people think that more 
money is needed to keep groups 
budgets from being axed next 
year. Groups are growing, and 
more money is going to be needed 
to keep them going. F&R has been 
making the new budgets with the 
assumption that the fee will go 
up. If it doesnt, across the board 
cuts will more than likely take 
place. The motion to endorse the 
increase in the Activities Fee 
passed at a vote of 16-3-0.
A motion was made that the 
Student Senate ask the Univer
sity to direct the ROTC organiza
tions on campus to cease their 
practice of discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation. After 
brief discussion, the motion 
passed, 9 for, 7 opposed, and 1 
abstention.
A motion was made that Senate
responded to a request for backup 
on an emergency call to the fra
ternity area. While the officer was 
not in the vehicle, person(s) un
known entered and ripped the 
radio microphone out of the ve
hicle.
4/20 DOMESTIC DISTUR
BANCE, 4:50 am. A male caller 
phoned Carnegie Mellon Police to 
report a female screaming for help 
in a nearby room in Morewood 
Gardens. Campus Police re
sponded and found a female Car
negie Mellon student who was 
very upset and crying in the room. 
An unidentified male was also in 
the room. However, since no signs 
of physical abuse were visible and 
since the student refused police 
intervention and said that she 
was not being held against her 
will, no further action was taken 
at this time. The resident assis
tant for the area was also noti
fied; she said that the student 
and her boyfriend have often 
become involved in loud verbal 
arguments but that she was 
unaware of any physical abuse. 
Compiled by NICOLE 
BROCKMANN
asks CFP and PANHEL to fur
nish to Senate a report outlining 
the mechanisms they have 
adopted or will adopt to ensure 
that they will not practice dis
crimination on the basis of creed, 
color, sexual orientation, national 
origin, race, or religious or politi
cal persuasion. It was pointed out 
that this clause probably exists in 
all of the Greek organizations 
charters. While this cause is 
worthy, some people were con
cerned about targeting certain 
organizations rather than the 
entire campus. At this point, the 
resolution was withdrawn and an 
amended version was introduced 
changing Greek organizations 
to all organizations receiving 
funds from the Activities Fee. 
This motion failed, 7-9-0.
General Discussion: Some 
people thought that the last reso
lution would not do any good; how 
would it be enforced? Education 
seemed to be a more popular 
method of solving the problem of 
discrimination. Otis took this 
discussion to heart as far as the 
fraternities go. Voting rights will 
be taken away if discrimination 
involving a fraternity is proved.
Anything said about ROTC in 
this meeting does not reflect offi
cial ROTC policy.
Results from the petitions for 
Senate:
GSIA: 1 (Michael Loomis) 
H&SS: 2 (StewartBames, Hyun 
Shin)
CIT: 2 (Guy Spivack, Chris 
Warner)
CFA: 1 (Chris Neighbor)
MCS: 1 (not validated) 
Write-in campaigns are 
strongly encouraged.
The final point of discussion 
was about The Tartan. Senate 
would like to see The Tartan 
practice better, more accurate 
reporting. Senate has a large 
turnover rate and is made up of 
new people who are not necessar
ily responsible for some of the 
problems with the Senate today.
Submitted by M. J. Kelly
continued from page 1
of increasing the worlds knowl
edge base. It represents an effort 
to use research, the primary 
method for increasing the knowl
edge base, as a mechanism to 
improve our ability to form and 
manage international organiza
tions.
Cyert also stressed the impor
tance of the institute to the inter
national community. While the 
Carnegie Bosch research will tend 
to concentrate in the management 
area, it will have a broader sig
nificance for other organizations 
as well as society, he added.
Cyert also expects the institute 
to place a heavy emphasis on the 
relationship between manage
ment and technology.
Cyert emphasized the inde
pendence of the institute and its 
members. The Bosch Corpora
tion will not influence the scien
tific work of the institute. The 
responsibility of the research will 
be given to the faculty.
Cyert will visit Germany in the 
near future to enhance his knowl
edge of the Bosch Group and their 
business techniques.
Cyert noted that the formation 
of the Carnegie Bosch Institute is 
one of three recent business proj
ects in which Carnegie Mellon 
has had a major role. We had an 
announcement of the Sony Cor
poration locating a major plant in 
this area, said Cyert, and we
"Knowledge is the 
key variable in the 
world in relation 
to economic de
velopment.
 Richard Cyert, 
president
had the opening of the eastern 
sales office for the NeXT Corpora
tion. Today we have the estab
lishment of the Carnegie Bosch 
Institute. All three of these events 
are related. Knowledge is the key 
variable in the world in relation 
to economic development. That 
means that universities are the 
key institute of this development. 
Although the management 
structure of the institute is not ; 
final, Cyert noted that the insti
tute will set up a governing board 
chaired by six people, three from 
Bosch and three from Carnegie 
Mellon. Incoming Carnegie Mel
lon President Robert Mehrabian  
will be one of those members.
Cyert added that the $15 mil
lion Bosch is providing will not be 
spent instantly but instead mil 
be put into the Carnegie Mellon 
endowment. The interest gerier; 
ated by the fund will be used'to 
operate the institute.

Student Senate Minutes

---------------------------------------------------

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 April 1990
Students to decide on fee increase
continued from page 1
athat there are a number of new 
organizations and then theres the 
increases in cost.
> - Some of the major increases 
-since 1986, as Cox points out, 
jjyiclude Spring Carnival, the Ac
tivities Board, and the Univer
sity Rowing Club. Spring 
r Carnivals budget saw the charges 
ofcr electricity jump from $2,748 
Tin 1987, to $22,900 the next year, 
-and to: $26,700 last year. ABs 
budget was $114,3235 for 1984- 
85, but increases in costs of con
certs and lecturers pushed it to 
$181,528 by 1989-90. The Rowing 
Club budget more than doubled 
in just one year  going from 
$5,200 in 1988-89 to $12,530 in 
1989-90.
The are also a number of new 
^organizations that require money 
that the previous fee increase 
hadnt predicted. Cox said that a
number of organizations have 
been formed since the last in
crease: the University Rowing 
Club, the Robotics Club, the 
Voices United Gospel Choir, the 
CMU Triathlon, the Fencing Club, 
the Objectivist Club, and the 
Womens Lacrosse team, Soccer 
team, and Ultimate Frisbee team.
One of the other new costs to 
consider is the Greek Rush fund
ing proposal, which will add an
other $19,155 to the budget.
To Cox, the increased costs are 
offset by the benefits received. I 
feel that with CMUs stressful 
environment, and the small 
amount of time the students 
have, she said, the students need 
a large variety choices of activi
ties.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy also supports the in
crease. I think that the bottom 
line is that there is a need for the
increase, he said. Its very posi
tive when you look what [activi
ties] are going on.
Murphy is happy with the cur
rent state of student clubs, prais
ing the general trend of respon
sible spending. But he sees im
provement in the future, with not 
only an increased variety of or
ganizations, but greater input 
from the [Student Affairs Office] 
to do a lot more in support and 
leadership development.
Among the few on Student 
Senate who oppose the fee in
crease is GSIA Senator Michael 
Loomis. In a letter to the editor of 
The Tartan, Loomis calls on stu
dents to defeat the referendum in 
opposition to Senate funding of 
Greek Rush.
Neighbor said that failure to 
approve the increase would cause 
drastic cuts in funding levels to 
student organizations and activi
ties. Well have to go through the 
budgets and cut back the budgets 
to 1988 levels, Neighbor said. 
Many groups will be hurting for 
funding. Groups would be asked 
to go through their budgets and 
voluntarily make cuts.
Neighbor said that there are 
certain specific expenditures that 
could be cut  like a new sound 
system for AB Tech that would 
cost $33,000. AB wants the sys
tem to replace its current system, 
which they say cant last more 
than one or two years. The new 
system would be better suited to 
produce events in various loca
tions on and near campus.
Cox said that the increase af
fects many more things than just 
the Greek allocation. If it doesnt 
pass, she said, then the Fund
ing and Recognition committee 
will have to cut the budgets that

Shuttle routes future remains unclear
continued from page 1
At this time we are probably
* .going,to recommend maintaining 
^the full shuttle route, said Carnegie Mellon Chief of Police James 
*faaPaglia.
lllr According to Murphy, the ad
ministration is leaning towards 
_rmaintaining the full route, at least 
n-for the upcoming 1990-91 year, 
^primarily because students have 
,r^lready committed to housing.... 
-We cant anticipate that students 
^would be expected to know that 
sihe shuttle route was determined 
"j?y where University housing ex, rfsts.
7nn Murphy could not say, however, 
.r-what decision will be made reH^arding the shuttle service after 
~-ihe 1990-91 year.
5jWe must begin looking at the
future and looking at the issue of 
what alternatives exist, he said. 
Whatever is done in the future 
should be an independent judge
ment and very clearly communi
cated early in the process. 
Obviously, said LaPaglia, 
wed want to let people know 
about [changing the route] way in 
advance.
Wed make the decision early 
and make sure that people knew 
about it so that they could weigh 
it into their decisions about hous
ing, said Murphy.
It is even possible that the serv
ice may be expanded to include 
other areas, according to Murphy. 
He is still unsure as to what those 
areas would be, however.
There is some discussion, he 
said, unrelated to funding, as to
what the route should be. Some 
questions we have to ask are: Are 
there other areas to which wed 
want to provide coverage? How 
would we do it? How would we 
funditwheres the moneygoing 
to come from?
We still have to look at other 
routes, said LaPaglia. One op
tion under consideration involves 
a route that gives preference to 
students in University housing 
but that also meets the needs of 
others.
According to LaPaglia, there are 
two points which need to be con
sidered. One is this question of 
the route  having the best 
shuttle route which would oper
ate at the best times. The other is 
the issue of funding. According to 
LaPaglia, between $16,000 and

^from the faculty mailboxes, re~moved by an unknown third party.
} Soon after, a second memo ap,! peared, signed by 22 faculty 
I members and addressed to Bailey 
I and McGuire. The second memo 
 protested the removal of the first.
At press time, University offij cials refused to comment on the 
\ situation. We are not going to 
1 j gomment until next week and we 
j ^vill not respond to an anonymous 
! memo, said Carnegie Mellon 
"Provost Angel Jordan late Sun! day-] Cyert has indicated that an
 J announcement would occur Mon{ day or Tuesday.
\ But Jordan confirmed that 
! Bailey?s future at GSIA was in 
! question last Friday. Betsy 
I IBailey] indicated that she was 
interested in stepping down, he 
i said. Jordan did not comment on 
\ any plans that McGuire might
 have.
j Jordan told The Tartan that 
! two faculty members: Yuji Ijiri, 
R.M. Trueblood University Prol fessor of Accounting & Econom! ics, and ecomonics professor 
Dennis Epple are candidates for 
acting dean. The anonymous 
j -memo claimed a third candidate, 
an unnamed political ecnomist,
| 'also existed.
Ijiri claimed, I am not a candi! date. I am totally out of circula! tion on this matter.
Bailey refused to comment 
y when contacted by The Tartan 
Sunday. McGuire was out of town 
; and could not be reached.
Between Tuesday and Thurs; day, both memos were supplied to 
the GSIA student newsletter 
.. Robber Barrons. The memos were 
| to be published in a special four; page issue with a cover reading 
; -Is GSIA Dead? in bold letters.
 While the memos were being
duplicated by one of the 
newsletters editors, the editor 
was approached by Patti OToole, 
a member of GSIAs external af
fairs committee. According to the 
editor who requested anonymity, 
she asked that Robber Barrons 
postpone publication of the issue 
until after the 40th anniversary 
celebration due to the cover con
tents. After deliberation by Rob
ber Barrons editors, the issue was 
pulled.
OToole insists that her request 
was not based on the contents of 
the issue. We had a meeting with 
180 students who told us we had 
to boost our image and improve 
our ranking, said OToole. Then 
this comes out when there will be 
lots of media and people who can
$20,000 is needed to keep the 
shuttle operating at its current 
level.
Im sure well find a way, he 
said. Its just a matter of doing it 
in the most cost-effective man
ner.
He said that one option which 
had been considered and rejected 
was the idea of creating an en
tirely new shuttle route which 
did not in some way piggyback 
the current route. According to 
LaPaglia, creating a totally new 
shuttle route would almost double 
the operating cost.
LaPaglia said that he is cur
rently in the process of construct
ing a proposal showing the costs 
of all options. Officials do not know 
when a final decision on the 
shuttle route will be made.
Student claims fee 
distributed unequally
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
About $37.50. Thats how 
much Greeks get out of their 
$80 Student Activities Fee ac
cording to a survey done by 
junior IM major Scott Zucker. 
By his own admission however, 
I want to stress that this isnt 
an accurate survey, he said, 
but I think it generally helps to 
prove my point that the fee is 
skewed.
Zucker spent the past month 
distributing surveys to stu
dents; the questions were de
signed to gauge the frequency 
with which students utilized 
each of the many groups that 
are funded by the Student Ac
tivities Fee.
The concern I had, said 
Zucker of his reasons for con
ducting the survey, was that 
the Greeks werent getting a lot 
out of the Student Activities 
Fee. His survey results have 
now convinced him of that. 
Nevertheless, he has now de
termined that an Activities Fee 
increase would benefit the 
Greek community.
A senator who sits on the 
Funding and Recognition com
mittee, Zucker said, I can see 
first hand if the fee doesnt go 
up to $100, there will be very 
little left for special allocations, 
if any. And it is the special 
allocation of Greek rush fund
ing that would be cut if the 
increase werent to pass.
Theres a greater likelihood 
of Greeks getting additional 
special allocations in the future 
if the fees go up, said Zucker.
That would only come with an.:, 
increase of Greek all-campus ~ 
events.
Another purpose for the sur
vey was to determine what 
organizations were receiving an 
unfair portion of the Activities 
Fee relative to the number of 
students who gain utility from 
of them. I dont think the Ac
tivities Fee has an equal distri
bution, says Zucker.
Although his results r . Ph 
less inequality among fu . led 
organizations than he hau ini
tially expected, he points out 
that there are some outstand
ing examples that should recti
fied.
The Hockey team receives 
$12,250 according to Zuckers 
data. That, divided by 50, the 
estimated number of players 
and spectators combined, is 
$245 per person. Zucker also 
points to the Baseball team, 
which he determined in the 
same manner to receive $60 per 
person.
Zuckers figures were deter
mined by receiving surveys from 
7.9 percent of the non-Greek ' 
student population and 16.6 
percent of the Greeks. This, ii-i 
conjunction with the tendency  
of some of the questions to yield 
imprecise answers, threatensthe accuracy of the results.
Zucker acknowledges th'S*' 
problems with his survey, yet 
nevertheless stands by the re
sults in the implications :he.-y2 
present. Zucker conducted and'I 
funded the survey inde: 
ently, and plans to pres; 11 li* 
and his results to Student deri1' 
ate in the near future.

the cover.
At press time, it remained diffi
cult to separate truth from ru

from administrators in Warner 
Hall or GSIA, yet masters stu
dent Mike Salk claimed, Most 
students know that Dean Bailey 
and Tim McGuire are no longer in 
their positions. Both remained 
in their posts late Sunday.
Student reaction has mainly 
focused on the schools handling 
of the situation. The timing is 
bad and the way they handled it 
horrendous, said masters stu

R0TC gay policy questioned
The sexual orientation issue has be
come subject of discussion in the 
past 18 to 24 months as the nation 
has matured in its thinking. The 
change wont come as fast as you or I 
would like it. It's the way things 
work. 
 William Elliott 
vice president for enrollment
continued from page 1
gay rights issue and theyre not 
inconsistent.
Elliott also said he recognizes 
the benefits of ROTC, yet stresses 
that the program should appre
ciate, understand, and grow to 
the point of change, something 
he cited as characteristic of the 
Carnegie Mellon environment.
The sexual orientation issue 
has become subject of discussion 
in the past 18 to 24 months as the 
nation has matured in its think
ing, said Elliott. He feels the issue 
will go the way of race and gender 
divisions in the military. The 
change wont' come as fast as you 
or I would like it, he said. Its the 
way things work.
Students who receive scholar
ship money from ROTC are re
quired to serve four years of ac
tive service and an additional four 
years of reserve duty in the mili
tary. The military service require
ment effectively excludes gays 
from ROTC, since gays are pro
hibited from serving in the mili
tary. If a change is to come to 
ROTC, it will have to originate in 
the U.S. military service.
Attempts have been made to 
bring around change. The Penta
gon said that about 1,400 men 
and women are discharged each 
year for violating the militarys 
ban on gays. Some have chal
lenged it in the Supreme Court.
The Los Angeles Times recently 
reported on two such cases. The 
Supreme Court expressed its 
opinion on the matter by declin
ing to hear two appeals, one from 
James W. Woodward, a former 
naval officer who now runs a gay 
veterans group in San Diego, and 
the other from Miriam Ben-Shalom, a former Army Reserve drill 
sergeant and a teacher in Mil
waukee.
Ben-Shalom waged a losing 16-
year court battle, which cost her 
life savings and her home. I didnt 
loseAmerica lost, she told the 
Times. But it hurts like bloody 
hell to think America doesnt love 
me.
A spokesman for the Pentagon 
told The Tartan that currently 
the issue is not being reviewed by 
the military service. Change via 
the court system is also unlikely 
in light of last months rejection of 
the suits filed by Ben-Shalom and 
Woodward. He believes change 
will come from Congress.
Scott Williams, a spokesman 
for Senate Armed Services Com
mittee Chair Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), 
doesnt see the issue as having 
much momentum. Its not a clear 
political movement, he said.
However, there are those who 
are trying hard to get the ball 
rolling. Representative Gerry 
Studds (D-Mass.) headed a for
mal protest of the ousting of two 
gay students from ROTC in sepa
rate incidents. The letter was sent 
to Secretary of the Navy Law
rence Garrett and signed by 
thirty-five congressmen, includ
ing Pennsylvania Representa
tives Tom Foglietta and Peter 
Kostmeyer.
In addition to addressing the 
retroactive recovery of scholar
ship grants from recruits who 
have been found to be gay, the 
letter states, In our view, it is 
wrong that private sexual orien
tation remains grounds for dis
missal from the U.S. military.
Further support for gay rights 
came from a report by a Pentagon 
research center that concluded 
that the military should consider 
ending its discriminatory prac
tices against gays. The Pentagon 
rejected the report, however, ac
cording to an October report by 
The New York Times, because it 
went beyond its initial mandate 
of determining security risks 
posed by gays.
The Times also reported that a 
senior official said in an internal 
Pentagon correspondence that the 
report was biased, flawed, offen
sive, and wasteful of government 
resources in that it went far be
yond its task when it examined 
the broader issue of gays suita
bility for military duty.
Fornow, said Williams, Itlooks 
like the same thing as the issue of 
women in the military, and points 
to the probability of eventual 
Congressional action.

We have the option of raising 
the Activities Fee from $80 to $100 
a year.
We think the raise is a good 
idea.
The Activities Fee helps fund 
the other side of Carnegie Mellon
 the fun side. It pays for every
thing from hockey sticks to part of 
the newspaper youre reading.
Unfortunately, this year it didnt 
pay for as much as was expected.
Budgets had to be cut and some 
organizations were squeezed.
The squeeze came two years 
earlier than expected. The last 
Activities Fee raise was supposed 
to solve the problems of shrinking
budgets. However, two years ago 
there was no funding for a crew 
team or Rush. There are more 
options available to students now, 
and wed like to see that trend 
continue.
If the Activities Fee is not raised, 
some hard choices will have to be 
made. Some new organizations 
may not be created, and acrossthe-board cuts could become an
nual occurrences.
To people who claim they do not 
get much out of the Activities Fee 
now, a $20 increase may be hard 
to take. However, the increase may 
provide a chance to fund activities 
missing from campus life today.
And to those who are already 
getting what they want out of the 
Fee, the increase will allow them 
to continue to do so.
Senate can learn from other groups
In a speech to students this 
semester, President Cyert spoke 
of CMU as a place which should 
create leaders for tomorrow. That 
vision seems to be fading fast.
Student government, the theo
retical leader of the student body, 
has become a wasteland devoid of 
leadership. This semester we see 
only one candidate for student 
government president and no 
contested Senate elections.
Without demeaning any of the 
incoming senators, the near fu
ture holds little hope for better 
leadership because, frankly, the 
new representatives arent likely 
to get fired up to do much.
If youre looking for examples of 
student leadership, student gov
ernment is not the place to go. Try 
looking instead at some other 
organizations on campusheres 
an incomplete list:
KGB. In just two years, this
social group has gone from non
existence to two trophies in the 
booth competition at Carnival. It 
has a thriving, active member
ship that seems excited about the 
future of the organization.
Spirit. This group has led the 
way in raising issues of racial 
sensitivity and campus diversity. 
Three buggy wins in the last four 
years isnt too shabby, either; this 
is an organization that sets a goal 
and then goes about meeting it.
Womens Center. The found
ers of the Center fought to find 
space on a campus without any so 
that they could provide a muchneeded place for women to go.
What we need in our govern
ment is innovative and enthusi
astic leaders  leaders who can 
inspire us to reach goals we arent 
even thinking of currently.
Maybe they should take a cue 
from some of their constituents.
Tell GSIA students whats going on
Heres a test. Walk into the main 
lobby of GSIA. Ask a student who 
will be dean next week.
The likely response will be, I 
dont know, but Ive heard a ru
mor that (insert faculty member) 
will be acting dean.
President Cyert, Provost Jordan, 
and Dean Bailey know whats up. 
It seems no one else does.
Everyone involved with GSIA 
simply wants to know whats going 
on, and they have a right to know. 
What they dont hear through

Senate should not fund the fraternities
Os
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Tuesday night,
Student Senate 
voted to spend 
$20,000 of the Stu
dent Activities Fee on 
fraternity parties. This allocation vio
lated Article XIII. 5. d. of the student gov
ernment constitution which forbids the 
allocation of monies to non-funded or
ganizations for projects that could occur 
without student activities funds. Fraternity parties have been occurring without 
student activity fee money.
Student Senate then voted to call a 
referendum to raise the activity fees $20 
a year. Thus, part of the reason for this 
increase is to fund fraternity parties.
If this angers you, please vote against 
the referendum to raise student fees this 
week. If this referendum is not passed, 
Student Senate will not have the money 
to pay for the fraternity parties. Also, 
please consider running for Student
Senate so you can help me siop similar 
outrages in the future.

official channels will get filtered 
through back-alley networks, and 
probably wont be completely 
right.
One of the most popular courses 
at GSIA is one in crisis manage
ment. The class teaches that a 
crisis left unmanaged results in a 
lot of pain and radical change.
Whether or not the University 
realizes it, there is a crisis at GSIA
 one of confidence and credibil
ity. Its time to start managing the 
crisis and ease the pain.

In his column last 
week [Dont throw 
away that oil, espe
cially with Earth 
Day approaching, 4/
17], Randy Udavcak reports, But while 
environmental and recycling agencies 
implore consumers not to dump old oil, 
all of the agencies in the Pittsburgh 
area I talked to have no idea what to do 
with the stuff. Apparently, Udavcak 
called recycling centers, and not the 
logical place to take oil  gas stations. 
For instance, Doug Hess Exxon, just 
across the bridge from CMU, will take 
used motor oil and charges only 25
cents a gallon. Ironically, Udavcak uses 
most of his column to express frustration 
about government regulations, but if 
Pennsylvania had a motor oil regulation 
like many states, he would have had no 
trouble disposing of his five gallons of oil 
at any gas station.
Udavcak speaks of an undercurrent 
of cynicism surrounding Earth Day 
1990, because he suggests that those 
who are promoting environmental poli
cies drive inefficient cars, live in poorly 
insultated houses, and buy styrofoam. 
But in fact, most environmentalists I 
know ride bicycles, havent eaten tuna 
fish in years to protest dolphin killing, 
and have bags of recyclables in their
basements.
The column also suggests thit the 
Corporate Average Fuel Economyregulations are legislative masturbition 
because Detroit has found ways around 
the regulations. He fails to explain 
then why the automobile indistry is 
fighting this masturbation with hun
dreds of registered lobbyists andaletter 
writing campaign. Udavcak also ig
nores the fact that the fuel efficency 
standards were instrumental irj re
ducing oil consumption in the Uiited 
States and causing the oil glut.

Dexter Kobayashis Features article 
Earth Day 1990 hits 
Point Park on the last 
day of Carnival [4/
Letter to 
the Editor
17] is yet another example of The 
Tartans brand of inaccurate, biased 
journalism. Although this article does 
mention a few of the significant envi
ronmental issues confronting us on 
this Earth Day, it gives virtually no in
formation about the scope or substance 
of these issues.
What it does give us, however, are 
two substantial anti-environmental 
quotes from The New American, a 
shockingly right-wing magazine, and 
from the John Birch Society, a bla
tantly racist, sexist, anti-gay organi
zation. Unfortunately, it is only mildly 
surprising that The Tartan should 
choose to align itself with such a re
pugnant organization.
Not only, however, is this quote repugnant, but it is blatantly inaccurate. 
Although global warming is a cpntested 
issue, the effect of chemicals on the 
environment is not. PCBs, DDT, dioxins, 
and a whole host of other pesticides and 
industrial wastes are proven cancercausers in humans, and yearly cause the 
death of billions of other organisms.
Finally, this article'gives no hint of the 
growing environmental concerns of most 
Americans. A recent nationwide Wall 
Street Journal!,NBC News poll of 1,001 
Americans indicates that, by a ratio of 
six to one, Americans are willing to pro
tect the environment even if it means 
they will pay higher prices for goods and 
services. The poll goes on to say that 
eight out of ten would separate their 
trash for recyling and give up superflu
ous and plastic packaging to reduce 
waste, and three out of four would favor 
a ban on disposable diapers.
Although President Bush and The 
Tartan probably favor unchecked envi
ronmental destruction in favor of unsustainable economic growth, the imeri> 
can public is hardly of this opinijn. For: 
them, quality of life means mo than 
just a bigger paycheck, but iipludes 
good health, a healthy ecosystein, and 
a beautiful and thriving wild ejvironment for themselves and for fenera
tions to come.

Hypersensitivity problems must er
o*
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
This letter is in re
sponse to the countless 
letters Ive read in The 
Tartan in which some
one is complaining that 
his or her minority is being ignored or 
even slandered. My purpose here is to try 
and explain that much of the problem 
lies not with the campus as large, but 
with a few highly sensitive members of 
minorities on campus.
I dont think anyone would challenge 
me on the assertion that this campus is 
diverse, highly diverse. To list all the 
ethnic origins, cultural and religious be
liefs, and sexual orientations present on 
this campus would take half a page of 
this newspaper. The benefits of this 
diversity are left to the readers discre
tion, but my point is that the rest of the
campus cannot be realistically held re
sponsible for accidental slurs against 
one or another of these diverse groups.
A case in point is last weeks letter, 
Dining Service should cater to all, [4/ 
17]. The two Jewish (I assume) authors 
expressed their irritation toward dining 
services for not providing traditional 
Jewish foods over the Passover. Did the 
people in charge sit down and decide to 
ignore the holiday altogether and pro
vide breaded foods which they could not 
eat? I dont think so. Matzo bread, gefilte 
fish, and matzo ball soup were provided. 
Instead of being satisfied with this, the 
authors complained that these foods were 
not enough.
The bottom line is that dining service, 
the administration, campus police, and 
especially the student community can
not base their life and actions on what
howofthe
will or will not satisfy or offend hyper
sensitive people. I have Jewishlfriends 
who were totally satisfied witty the food 
provided over Passover, yet ijou cant 
please everyone all the time.
Some might say the situation could be 
remedied by requiring a cultural educa
tion class during the freshmm year. I 
concede that idea might mo^e toward 
relieving some of the so-calle( insensitivity perceived by some of the minori
ties on campus. However, my question is 
this: Is it the responsibility of the vast 
majority to educate themselves in the 
beliefs and practices of the man>; minori
ties to ensure that nothing they say or do 
will offend anyone? I say it is not. I think 
much of the problem lies with the minor
ity in itself.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 April 19909
Earth Day still needs to be practiced
The grizzled old man was sit
ting on the park bench, eating a 
recycled cheese sandwich, when 
a group of youngsters stopped by.
How old are you, Gramps? one 
of them asked.
Pretty old, the man replied. 
Are you old enough to remem
ber Earth Day?
Yup, it was April 20,1970, but 
it seems like yesterday. Its hard 
to describe it if you werent there. 
Fumes were coming out of the 
tailpipes of cars, black smoke was 
billowing from factory chimneys, 
and we soon discovered we had 
something called acid rain that 
killed all the fish in the freshwa
ter lakes.
Aw, said one of the kids. No 
one would be stupid enough to kill 
all the fish.
It was worse than that. People 
threw anything they wanted into 
the rivers, and they flushed gar
bage and other stuff into the ocean. 
I saw it myself. We couldnt even 
go swimming on the beaches be
cause it wasnt sfe.
Art Buchwald
Wow, yelled one little boy. Im 
glad that I wasnt alive then. 
Developers built houses over 
nuclear waste sites, and legiti
mate companies hired gangsters 
to dump poisonous waste mate
rial from one end ofthe country to 
the other. Nobody in the govern
ment would take responsibility 
for it. In those days the average 
citizen didnt do too well against 
the lobbyists when they appealed 
their case to Washington.
Not like today, huh, Gramps? 
one of the kids laughed.
Thats right. Today the gov
ernment really worries about its 
dumps. Before Earth Day people 
sprayed insecticide on everything. 
Thats because no one knew it 
was bad for kids.
Havent they stopped spraymgr
No, Gramps told him, but 
they now give you time to cover 
your car with plastic and crawl 
into your house. I guess the big
gest thing that concerned us in 
those days was pesticides run
ning off into the drinking water. 
The chemical companies claimed 
that we had nothing to be afraid 
of, and to prove it, the president of 
a company drank a glass of water 
on TV.
They must have been pretty 
exciting times, Gramps.
We were pretty wild in those 
days. We used to throw our bottles 
into the street and burnt our trash 
in the back yard and even toss 
Styrofoam plates and cups into 
the ocean.
We still do that, another boy 
said.
Well, you cant expect the 
population to change its habits in 
just 20 years. Our one objective 
on Earth Day was to prevent the 
next generation from inheriting a 
cesspool. Two decades ago we 
declared, Enough is enough. We
have to make the highway smell 
like the sea breeze and the sea 
breeze smell like the highway. Of 
course, everyone was for it even 
after they found out how much it 
would cost.
So what did you do when you 
found out how much money was 
involved, Gramps?
We sang a lot  mostly tunes 
like this land was made for you 
and me. 
Are you sure youre telling us 
the truth, Gramps?
What part do you mean, son? 
The part where people didnt 
care what they discarded or where 
they discarded it.
I swear to you it was that way. 
I know its hard for you kids to 
imagine how different it was 
compared with how spic and span 
everything is today. It was so bad 
then that you couldnt see the 
forests for the rain.

I was so excited about Spring Carni
val that I begged three of my female 
friends from home to come here for it.
Nothing, I mean nothing would pique 
their interest about this city. I tried 
my best to convince them that they 
really would have a good time, but no 
dice. Not even the male/female ratio 
worked.
I just had to tell them what they 
missed.
Dear ,
I really wish you came to visit me at 
CMU during Spring Carnival this past 
weekend. Yeah, I know youre busy, 
but you really ought to take a break 
every now and then.
Anyway, it was so great! Thursday 
I walked around the midway about 20 
times, jn two hours. There were some 
really great booths, and one of my 
friends won a goldfish forme. Unfortu
nately, it already died. Anyway, I went 
to this dance that nobody else went to. 
What fun. I eventually went out around 
midnight to hit the fraternity houses 
and get drunk, but for some reason I 
was just not in a party mood. I wonder 
if it had to do with the fact that one of 
my friends in one of the fraternities 
was drunk enough to have eaten eight 
of the goldfish they were giving out as 
prizes at their booth.... I was mildly 
grossed out.
Friday was just wonderful. It was 
the first time I could remember having 
a Friday off without it being a holiday 
or vacation of some sort. And to top it 
all off, it even rained. How typical. I 
slept in and rested all day so I could
Susan Abrams
party all night. Believe it or not, I even 
did some of my homework (one of my 
friends called me a geek for that). In any 
case, I finally tore myself away from 
Industrial Bureaucracy so that I could go 
to one of the ScotchnSoda musicals I 
told you about. It was very good, and Im 
sure you would have enjoyed the part 
where one of the characters did what you 
would consider a very nice dance (you 
know what I mean). Youd have turned 
into a walking hormone. I later went 
back to the booths to see if anything new 
had popped up, but they had to close 
them early because of the rain. But that 
wasnt so bad  it gave me more time to 
party. And party I did. I went frat hop
ping like I used to back in September 
when I didnt know any better. I stayed 
for one beer and two songs at just about 
every house. My friends and I were to
tally soakedyou know what I mean.... 
We went back to see a certain goldfish 
eater at his house  he was on number 
17 by then.
Saturday I woke up around 8 am to 
watch the buggy races. I told you about 
these things before those huge, slightly 
misshapen and discolored hotdogs on 
wheels. In any case, they were postponed 
because of the rain. But naturally, my 
friends were ignorant of this semi-obvious fact until we were tired of looking 
like drowned rats and finally got up to 
leave since nothing was happening. Yes,
I was mad, so I went back to bed. By 
the time I got up again, the sun had 
finally come out. It had even started to 
get warm (a major change from the 
usual Pittsburgh weather)! I felt so 
good that I actually went on the rides. 
We did the frat hopping thing again, 
and happened to walk into one of 
them just as they were celebrating 
their victory for winning the booth 
competition  Ive always wanted to 
get beer spilled down the front of a 
new white shirt. Later I went back to 
visit Mr. Goldfish, only to find that he 
was so drunk by now that he didnt 
even recognize me. That must be why 
he was otherwise preoccupied... ahem.
Sunday (dont ask me why) I woke 
up early again (I think I was anxious 
to get out and party every day this 
week). I didnt go to the buggy races, 
but heard that they were fun. While I 
sat outside trying to catch some sun, 
I could hear Oingo Boingo playing 
from across campus. And just when I 
thought Carnival was over, I heard 
PiKA loudly celebrating their buggy 
victory across the street.
I really had a good time. All I can 
say is that I wish you had been here 
with me. Maybe sometime youll de
cide to come out and visit, and then we 
can party just as I have been now. It 
will be so great  believe me! Like I 
always say, live life to the fullest!
Love ya to pieces!

Carnivals theme this year was Some
where in Timethe exact time appeared 
to be May 21,1989.
The Class of1989, my undergraduate 
class, graduated on that day, many of 
them vowing never to return.
A lot of them broke that promise last 
weekend. They came back for Carnival, 
braving the rain, the high school stu
dents, their old organizations which need 
money, and the crowd at Panther Hol
low Inn on Thursday night.
Seeing them here, one month before I 
take that same vow, gave me a lot to 
think about. A few of them had gone on 
to grad school as I did, but most of them 
are now happily (and in some cases un
happily) working. But they all looked 
different from the friends I remember.
They looked relaxed, knowing that 
they didnt have to be up at seven for 
buggy and that they dont have to find a 
way to get their homework done when 
their lives resume on Monday. They 
looked rested, with the only sleep lost 
before Carnival coming as a result of bad 
weather on the flight into Pittsburgh. 
They looked happy, knowing that they 
could drink at any time they wanted 
without being asked to take a Midway 
watch or push Hill 2.
Recent alumni tend to come back for 
Carnival instead of Homecoming. The 
parties are better and the temperature 
is warmer. Homecoming appeals to 
alumni who want to cheer for the Tar
tans again and open up their wallets. 
Carnival is for alumni who want to cheer 
for their buggy and eat some funnel cake.
Talking with my friends who had re
turned was scary, though. One close 
friend confided that it seems like it was 
ages ago, not 11 months ago, that he was 
a student. Granted, by the end of Carni
val, last week seemed like ages ago, but 
he already had trouble relating to stu
dent life up close.
Other friends came back with rings on 
their fingers. When not one, but two 
separate couples tell you that they are 
getting married on June 30, you first 
start humming the Twilight Zone theme 
then you start to feel a little old.
This is my last Carnival as a student. 
I pushed a buggy  twice, thanks to 
Mother Nature; helped build and run a 
booth; went to not nearly enough par
ties. Another milestone of my life has 
passed, and yes, it saddens me more 
than a little.
Hopefully next year, Ill be the person 
being greeted with, Howve you been? 
Whats the real world like? and Hey 
Stew, we need $50 for the booth, can you 
help out? I wonder what it will feel like 
on the other side of the wall. Will I feel 
like an outsider or an old friend?
Perhaps I sound too much like a phi
losopher. Or maybe Im someone who re
alizes that the end of Carnival is a meta
phor for the end of my collegiate career, 
and I feel sad about both.

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 April 1990
CefS eE9d en Sde yeuldse ydsRed SeGREre
After a week off, Im back. In any case, 
I would like to address something that 
happened concerning my last column. It 
seems that some members of the campus 
community didnt receive it well.
Actually, it came up in Student Senate. 
Senate decided that it actually repre
sented the campus community. Just to 
start off, thats a laugh. Senate thought 
that students would rather see things 
that pertain to them, nationally and inter
nationally. Senate thought that students 
would rather see columns on such things 
as East and West German unification 
and the like. I can understand that. I am 
very interested in what has been going 
on in Europe lately.
It didnt stop there. One Senator 
pointed out my column as an example of 
a stupid one The Tartan shouldnt run.
I would like to defend my position and 
also try to teach Senate a few things.
There are reasons why I wrote about 
the Florida police. First, I dont agree 
with the drinking age laws that are cur
rently in use. Second, I dont agree with 
how they are enforced. Third, the police 
were on a power trip. My friend was 
arrested for underage drinking because 
there was beer on the table, yet he wasn't 
drinking at the time. The cop was rude 
and offensive, and didnt follow proper 
procedure. When they give a badge and 
a gun to a man who drinks on the job, I 
am afraid of the standards a state places 
on getting a badge.
In addition to these reasons, I believe 
my column pertained to a great number
Rich Robinson
of students at CMU. It was amazing how 
many students I ran into at my hotel and 
nearby. I know I was a bit heavy-handed 
at the time, but calling my column stu
pid and saying it doesnt refer to anyone 
on campus is going a bit far.
Concerning The Tartan as a whole, 
every newspaper must decide what its 
readership is, and what type of informa
tion is most important for its readers. As 
a campus newspaper, the most impor
tant news for The Tartan to print is 
campus news  things that go on at 
campus. This includes things that di
rectly affect the students and faculty.
My column fits in this outline. Many 
CMU students were in Daytona, and 
experienced much of the same treat
ment from the police as I did.
Concerning the Forum section, I must 
address the topic of columns. The reason 
why most of the columns do not concern 
international or national occurrences is 
because there are relevant campus prob
lems that are regularly addressed rather 
than world news. Students who want 
more information on world events, other 
than those presented in the second-page 
news briefs, can buy national newspa
pers such as The New York Times, or a 
local paper like The Pittsburgh Press.
Another complaint Senate had was 
that the columns were opinionated. Col
umns are supposed to be the expressed 
opinion of the writer, trying to give a new 
or different angle on a subject. That is 
what separates the Forum section from 
the front page, or William Buckley from 
Associated Press briefs.
I think Student Senate is completely 
separated from the campus community. 
They live in a little isolated world, and 
really dont know what students want. 
Perhaps it is because the campus has 
never really had a majority vote in offi
cers. Senate is supposedly there for us, 
to help us out. I dont see that happening. 
They continuously screw over the Greek 
system, even though it comprises 33 
percent of the CMU population. They 
also dont really give a damn about inde
pendent organizations.
This is not to say that all the senators 
are bad. But the majority simply look 
after their own interests, railroading 
anyone who gets in their way. They dont 
look at what would help the campus or 
the students, but do help their group of 
friends and themselves.
Something has to change. Until it does, 
I find no reason why anything Senate 
says should be taken to represent the 
students in any way. Until they stop 
looking out for themselves and start doing 
what would be best for everyone, I con
sider them on the same level as the 
administration that has promised us the 
University Center year after year, delay 
after delay.

day-to-day activity here are tired 
of reading about someone being 
insulted or degraded. It is very 
true that some of these insults are 
very racist and must be addressed, 
but many of the complaints are 
about unintentional and unknow
ing acts that some hypersensitive
group or individual perceives as 
being discriminatory or offensive. 
If such an event was not meant 
maliciously, why not let it go? 
Why make a scene, call in the 
news, write to the paper?
To summarize the above points, 
minorities must recognize their 
own responsibility in resolving
the ethnic and racial issues on 
campus. This responsibility is not 
solely fulfilled through complaints 
and emotional rebuttals to per
ceived prejudice. It includes real
izing what is prejudice and what 
is a harmless and unintentional 
mistake brought on by the lack of 
knowledge of certain customs and
events which transpired decades 
or even centuries ago.
If everyone would just be a little 
more tolerant, life here on this 
campus could be much more pleas
ant.

Bad knees cant 
spoil a beauty
I have a very interesting 
friend. Her name is Becky and 
she is an international fashion 
model.
You may not believe that a 
successful model could have a 
name as simple or as un-exotic
, as Becky. She is a sweet,
' simple, girl-next-door.
Becky never dreamt of being a 
 model. While the other girls her 
age were fantasizing about the
- life Becky herself now lives, 
Becky Hewes wanted to be a
t. basketball star.
,Her entire life, she had been 
 involved in athletics in one form 
or another. She was a gymnast, 
ran track, played volleyball, and 
; excelled in basketball. For her 
own added enjoyment and to in
crease her strength and coordi
nation, she studied dance.
; At the age of 16 she stood just 
under 511. Her height made 
: her an alluring prospect for 
; coaches. She was a star for 
almost every team she played 
Jfor, regardless of the sport.
When she got to high school, 
things really started to take off 
for the Beckster. She went to 
basketball camp for a couple of 
summers and refined her
- talents. She was a national high 
r school all-star and was being
' recruited by some big named 
| colleges. Then, as they often do, 
i things started going bad.
She had always had a prob
lem with her knees. Bad knees 
i? are a handicap for any athlete,
; but they are death for basket; ball players. During the off; season, Becky ran the hurdles 
; for her high school track team. 
'During practice one day, she 
^landed wrong ... enough said.
- She traveled all along the 
'eastern seaboard visiting 
orthopedic surgeons and spe
cialists in sports medicine. But 
they all told her that her
)basketball career was over.
She went to a small liberal 
rs arts college for a year but really
- didnt know what she wanted to 
do. I met up with her during a 
Christmas vacation a few years
)ago and she was very depressed 
about her future. Since I met 
Becky when we worked together 
at a community theatre, we 
talked about her going into 
show business. But then I 
thought some more. I knew that 
with her height, looks, and 
poise, she would be a great 
model. I told her that she 
should get an agent and gave 
tier the name of a woman, who I 
.knew could help.
A week later, Becky was the 
featured model in a fashion 
spread for Macys. A month 
later, her face was all over the 
city in ads for stores and design
ers. Then, Ms. Eileen Ford, the 
owner of the most prestigious 
modeling agency in the world, 
called Becky to New York and 
hired her. Fords only advice to 
the now six foot tall blonde from 
. Atlanta, Lose five pounds.
The last time I heard from 
Becky, she was back home from 
Paris. Shes going to Italy in a 
week and from there, Spain.
Sut, after almost two years of 
r the jet-set lifestyle, shes still 
the sweet, girl-next-door.
She loves her life but does 
have one major complaint. With 
all of her other model friends 
and European connections, she 
fant find anyone who knows 
"aow to play a good game of onen-one.

Sigma Nu clinches IM 
majors floor hockey title
By KATIE CULBERTSON ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We knew we had the best team.

Intramural floor hockey action 
came to a close last Monday with 
the minors, intermediate, andmajors championship games in 
Thistle Hall. Intramural Floor 
Hockey this year enjoyed a record 
number of teams, 59, as well as 
enthusiastic players and fans, ac
cording to an IM press release.
Majors action was tight, with 
Sigma Nus Zoo A team edging 
out Todd Rockoff 1-0 in sudden 
death.
Junior Terrence Ross, Sigma 
Nus goalie, expressed a lot of 
confidence in his teams ability to 
go all the way. We knew we had 
the best team, he said, although 
the final game was so close.
Rockoff is a good team, said 
Ross. But Sigma Nu had an added 
incentive that pushed them to 
win  the revenge factor. Losing 
to Todd Rockoff last year in the 
majors finals was something Zoo 
A was determined to not let hap
pen again.
As for the rest of the tourna
ment, Ross cited Beta Theta Pi in 
the regular season as giving the 
eventual champions a run for their 
money.

The majors playoff circuit was a 
brief one, with only three teams 
 Beta, Sigma Nu, and Todd 
Rockoff. Todd Rockoff defeated 
Beta in the semi-finals, and Sigma 
Nu received a bye.
The intermediate playoffs were 
quick and painless also, as Theta 
Xi vs. Green Aces and Moose Jaw 
Warriors vs. ATO Heat squared 
offin the semi-finals. GreenAces 
and Moose Jaw Warriors battled 
it out in the finals, with Green 
Aces winning 2-1.
In minors, after breezing 
through the playoffs, a pumped 
Phi Kappa Theta minors team 
was stopped dead in its tracks, 
held scoreless by an equally psy
ched and more skilled Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon team. According 
to senior Mike Drout of Phi Kap, 
SAE was simply better, as re
flected in the 50 final score. They 
just outplayed us, said Drout.
SAE started the tournament 
with a bye in the first round, then
knocked off Sigma Nu B and No 
Equipment in the second and third 
rounds to arrive at the finals with 
Phi Kap.
Senior Warren Flax of SAE 
agreed that his team was more 
skilled, but credited Phi Kap for 
hustling like crazy  they were 
always running around, he said.
According to Flax, the Sigma 
Nu and Phi Kap games were SAEs 
best, as both were shut-outs. He 
also said that the tournament was 
especially physical, with major 
fights breaking out often. No 
Equipment, he said, was the 
toughest opponent.
Flax mentioned sophomore 
John Frieder and freshman Matt 
Miller as SAEs major offensive 
assets, and sophomore Bill Veltri 
as the most significant defensive 
contributor.
PM Kap defeated Pi Alpha 
Delta, Alpha Tau Omega, and Pi 
Kappa Alpha to advance to the 
finals.

Tthe mens tennis team defeated two of 
its PAC competitors  W&J and Grove 
City, and traveled to the UAA champion
ships at Case Western Reserve University 
over Spring Carnival.
.Last Monday, the Tartans defeated 
Washington and Jefferson 6-3. Wednes
day, the Tartans trounced Grove City 8-1.
Before the UAAs, Coach Richard 
Scheines believed the tournament would 
be interesting because, Were very good 
up top. The number one doubles and the 
number one singles are the Tartans best 
chance of getting a ranking in Division III, 
or as Scheines said, break into the big 
time.
Unfortunately , the big time broke the 
Tartans on the first day of the UAAs as the 
team lost all nine matches. However, 
Scheines points out that the UAA has four 
teams in the Division III national rank
ings. Emory is a top five team, Rochester is 
top ten, and Washington and Brandeis 
are both usually up there.
Freshman Andrew Lee lost in straight 
sets to Steve Ivankovich of the University 
of Chicago. Ivankovich was justnamed the 
Maroons number one player after beating 
the sixteenth ranked player in the coun
try.
Juniors Haja Rabe and Matt Davis and 
freshman Jeff Blankenship all went up 
against seeded players and were defeated. 
Freshman Chris Sheehan had the good 
fortune to go up against an unseeded NYU 
player, but still lost. Junior Mike Ference
lost to a Brandeis seed, but Scheines said 
e felt that he played well.
The doubles players fared no betterthan 
the Tartan single players did. The number 
one team drew a match against a weaker 
CWRU team andlost; the second and third 
teams played well but lost.
On the second day of competition, the 
Tartans played in the semifinals of the 
consolation tournament. The Tartans had 
a great day as they won seven of their 
nine matches to advance to the finals of 
the consolation tournament.
TheTartan singles players did extremely 
well, as five of six Tartans were victorious. 
Sheehan pulled what was, according to 
Scheines, the upsetofthe tournamentas 
he downed a superior Brandeis player in 
straight sets. Ference lost the only singles 
match, but his opponent was among the 
top 40 players in Division III tennis.
The number one doubles team lost to the 
number one Brandeis team, but the sec
ond and third teams beat their NYU 
counterparts.
On the final day of competition, the 
Tartans clinched a sixth-place finish by 
virtue of three head-to-head victories 
against seventh-place Case Western. 
Davis straight-set victory clinched the 
sixth spot, and Blankenship and the third 
doubles team added wins.
Today, CMU has a road match against 
Thiel, followed by a home match with 
Duquesne on Thursday, and the PAC play
offs this weekend. Scheines expects his 
team to win all the matches.
Weve really gotten a chance to see both 
ends, he said. In one [the UAA] we have 
to fight for sixth, while we should win the 
other [the PAC] easily.

The mens and womens track 
teams competed in the UAA 
championships at Emory Univer
sity in Atlanta, Georgia this week
end.
Unfortunately, the trip began 
with a rather hectic start as the 
teams arrived at Atlantas air
port. Apparently, some arrange
ments were confused and the team 
was left without a bus to take 
them to the hotel.
After this initial setback, the 
athletes responded with many 
impressive individual perform
ances on the field. The men fin
ished with an overall team score 
of 47 points, while the womens 
scored a total of 29 points, leaving 
both teams with a seventh place

The CMU lacrosse club had a 
tough day last Tuesday, taking 
a pounding from the Panthers, 
6-2, at Pitt Stadium. However, 
the club revived itself for the 
weekend, beating the 
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club 9-7. 
The Tartans avenged a loss to 
PLC earlier this season. See 
the story on page 16.

finish.
Starting off the scoring on the first day 
of competition, was freshman javelin 
thrower Robert Bruce who finished a 
strong fourth place.
I feel he (Bruce) had a very good throw 
and Im expecting good things in the 
future, said Coach Gary Meckley.
On the second day of competition so
phomore Dave Nespoli started the scor
ing with a fifth place finish in 10:03 in 
the 100 meters.
When asked for his evaluation of his 
performances Nespoli replied tha,tTwo 
laps into the race I thought I was out of 
it, but coach [Dario} Donatellis strategy 
of going out slow and finishing hard 
worked to my advantage.
Quick to follow Nespolis fine perform
ance were senior Len ONeal and fresh
man Brad Shapiro in the 1500 meters. 
ONeal finished a strong third in a blis
tering time of 3:57.51.
While this time was a new personal 
record for ONeal, he still feels there is 
room for improvement.
Theres no doubt that I am pleased 
with my time, he said. Had it not been 
for being spiked in the final 100 meters 
and some tactical errors, I feel the twotenths of a second needed for second 
place would have come a bit easier.
Shapiro, who was jokingly voted the 
man with the nicest sunglasses and hat, 
finished in sixth place with a time of 
4:02.04.
His comment for both honors was, A 
track meet is not a fashion show. It 
doesnt matter how good you look, just 
how well you run. Fortunately, I was 
able to excel in both categories.
Following the 1500 senior Rich Shipley 
placed third in the 110 meter hurdles 
with a time of 15.4 seconds. I knew it 
was going to be a good day when I got my 
[lucky race] number, said Shipley.
While the Tartans had no one entered 
in the next event, the 400-meters, they 
made up for it in the 100 meters with a 
second place finish by junior Jeff Illian in 
a time of 11.1. Because of injuries and 
lack of races I didnt finish as high as I 
expected but, Im still happy with my 
performance, he said.
After Illians strong finish, the Tar
tans were looking for a similar finish 
from junior Gary Harrison in the 800 
meters. However, he finished a some
what disappointing sixth with a time of 
1:57.1.
I expected to do much better, but it 
wasnt my type of race. The first 400 
meters was slow and usually I rely on my 
strength to run wire to wire.
Following the 800, freshman Sean 
Pempel competed in the 400 meter inter
mediate hurdles. Last year the Tartans 
suffered in this event due to lack of 
talent, but Pempel filled that hole with a
Some problems encountered throughout the 
season includes inclement weather, which led 
to a very small schedule. Because the teams 
had such little competition experience this 
season, and because they have no home 
home track on which to practice, they were 
put at a severe disadvantage next to their 
UAA counterparts.
fifth place finish in a time of 56.3 sec
onds.
It seemed like a really smooth race 
and Im very happy with my perform
ance, said Pempel.
Following the 400 hurdles was the 
5000 meters. All-American Senior Dave 
Supp, who previously hadnt lost a UAA 
event since his junior cross country sea
son, finished a disappointing fifth in 
15:35.05. Fellow senior Tim Berger fin
ished sixth in a time of 15:47.91.
During the majority of these running 
events many of the field events were 
taking place.
Unfortunately, CMU didnt fair well 
off the track. This lack of depth in the 
field events left the Tartans with only 
one bright spot on the final day of compe
tition.
Sophomore Jeffrey Bean Palaima 
finished fourth in the pole vault with a 
vault of 13 feet, five inches. I did better 
than I expected but with a couple more 
weeks of training I could have broken 
into the top three, he said.
The final event of the day was the 
1600- meter relay, which teamed ONeal, 
Shapiro, Pempel, and Harrison. The 
team raced to a fifth place finish in 
3:25.31, improving the foursomes time 
by three seconds.
The womens team, which lacks the 
depth of its UAA counterparts, was able 
to make some waves in a few of its best 
events.
On the opening day of competition 
sophomore Lois Raska broke the school 
record in the 800-meter run with a time 
of 2:27.23.
Unfortunately, Raska was unable to 
break into the top sixth in the finals the 
following day. I was very happy with my 
time in the prelims, but I wish I had run 
a smarter race in the finals, she said.
Freshman Kim Evans was the star 
performer for the Tartans, finishing 
fourth in the shot put with a throw of 33- 
07.5, and second in the discus with a toss 
of103-06, both of which were new school 
records.
If I hadnt stepped out of the circle too 
soon I could have won the event with my
toss of 117 feet, she said.
In the running events, the women 
scored their first point with a sixth place 
finish in the 400-meter relay. Jody Burig, 
Lisa Schmidt, Charsetta Grant, and Lois 
Raska teamed up to run a time of 52.5 
seconds.
Following the relay there was a dry 
spell of scoring for the Tartans. However 
when they finally scored, they scored 
big. Junior Lisa Schmidt finshed second 
in the 400 meter run with a time of 60.88 
which is a new school record. I think ev
eryone put out their finest performances 
and I just wanted to be part of it all, said 
Schmidt.
Following Schmidt was senior Jody 
Burig who placed fifth in the 100 meters 
with a time of 13.1. This was the finest 
performance of my college career and I 
owe it all to my teammates for their 
support.
The final event the Lady Tartans 
competed in was the 3000-meter run. 
Sophomore Caroline Lowe raced to a 
new school record of 10:32.14 and a third 
place finish.
Some of the athletes were disappointed 
with their performances. John Byrnes 
and Gary Meeker said, You cant win 
them all and sometimes you cant even 
place.
However, overall the team members 
and coaches were in high spirits. I think 
we have a really great group of athletes 
considering the adverse conditions they 
had to work through all season, said 
Assistant Coach Barry Robinson.
Some problems encountered through
out the season includes inclement 
weather, which led to a very small sched
ule. Because the teams had such little 
competition experience this season, and 
because they have no home home track 
on which to practice, they were put at a 
severe disadvantage next to their UAA 
counterparts. Also, the trip to Atlanta 
took place over Carnival weekend, and it 
was tough to pull athletes away.
Next week, the teams travel to Brook 
high school in West Virginia for the PAC 
championship.

Special to The Tartan
The Carnegie Mellon Lacrosse Club 
played the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club 
Friday for the second time this season.
In the previous meeting, PLC domi
nated the first half and went intohalftime 
with a 8-2 lead. CMU battled back and 
the game ended with a tough 11-9 loss.
But the tables turned Friday as PLC 
visited Fox Chapel, which CMU pres
ently calls home. Carnegie Mellons highpowered attack, led by freshman Miguel 
Triay, junior Rob Kendall, and a slew of 
midfielders, jumped on the PLC defense
 the CMU offense scored some critical
CMU boasted a four-goal lead in the
second half, but then the maturity of the 
more experienced PLC players whittled 
the lead down to nothing, to a 7-7 dead
lock. After some fancy offensive moves, 
CMU upped the score to the final 9-7. 
Defensively, sophomores Dave Pagani, 
Steve McAlon, and Hudson Tiffany, 
senior goalie Peter Vonderlieth contrib
uted to the win.
John Seekings, Kendall, Phil Kessler, 
sophomore Steve Ramey, and Bayard 
Johnson all kicked in one goal apiece, 
plus two goals apiece from Scott Johnson 
and Triay.
Sunday, the club heads to the St. 
Vincents Tournament at St. Vincent 
College. After the game Friday, it feels 
pretty prepared for the competition. On 
May 6, the club will face Bethany.

NHL playoffs boast excitement, 
upsets; Edmonton looks good
By MICHAEL D. C. DROUT
Tartan Staffwriter
The NHL playoffs thus far have 
provided excitement, superlative 
defense, and a decent crop of 
upsets. Montreal defeated Buf
falo in a hard fought series, the 
'^pitals beat the Devils in a 
contest for toughest team in the 
Patrick division, and the LA Kings 
managed to topple the defending 
Stanley Cup champion Calgary 
Flames. Heres a look at the sec^id round of the playoffs:
Patrick Division. Rangers vs. 
Capitals. The Rangers have two 
good lines, the Capitals only one. 
Fhe Rangers have the hot goaltending and the mental attitude 
that comes from winning the divi
sion and blowing away the first 
round opponents. So how can they 
lose? First of all, the Capitals 
tight-checking defense has caused 
problems for the Rangers all year. 
| they can clog up the neutral
zone, they will prevent the Nichols 
/ Gartner combo from scoring up 
to their potential. Secondly, the 
Rangers goaltending is streaky, 
and if they hit a rut, they will be 
unable to get out of it. Caps in 
seven.
Adams division. Boston vs. 
Montreal. The Bruins have al
ways had trouble getting past the 
Canadiens, and this year will be 
no exception. Montreal has tough 
defense, good forechecking, and 
the best goalie in the league. 
However, Boston will prevail in 
the toughest series of the playoffs 
due to Cam Neely being a better 
clutch player than Stephan 
Richer.
Norris Division. The Blues 
and Brett Hull are hot, the Hawks 
are tougher and have superior 
depth. Look for this series also to 
go seven games, with the Blues 
winning on a Hull night. The 
Hawks, even with Dennis Savard, lack the scoring punch of the
Blues, and though they play hard, 
they dont check as soundly as St. 
Louis. This series will see its share 
of penalties, fights, and cheap 
shots, but Keenan has less talent 
than he did with Philadelphia, 
and his system does not utilize 
Savard as much as is needed to 
win.
Smythe Division. Edmonton 
leads the Kings by two games. 
They have outscored them 13-1. 
Look for the Oilers in five, with a 
return to the cup for the Edmon
ton Dynasty. Jarri Kurri, Marc 
Messier, Bill Ranford, Simpson, 
Smith, and a hot Mark Lamb will 
bring the Oilers their next cup 
when they defeat Boston in the 
finals in six. Look for Messier to 
put on a Conn Smythe winning 
performance once Edmonton gets 
to the games that count. It should 
be one of the most exciting play
offs ever, as a stronger Boston 
team tries to avenge the sweep of 
the Oilers in 88.
K\A golf tees off
Carnegie Mellon head coach 
frch Erdelyi has a nucleus of 
even golfers who he hope will 
mprove upon the Tartans fifthS^ace UAA finish of a year ago. 
leading the seven are seniors 
jary Yacura and Don Michel and 
ophomore Sam Trinch. These 
hree are followed by senior Dour 
Remington, graduate student 
tyke Wiegand, junior Tom 
fturphy, and freshman Eben 
Warns. Remington was the TarSports Shorts
tans top finisher last season with 
a 36-hole score of 164. Michel, 
who will earn his fourth varsity 
letter this season, and Wiegand 
both fired a 175 last season.
PAC golf finals scheduled
Bethanys Tom Jingoli and Jeff 
Mills lead the list of returning 
performers in this years league 
golf championships. Last season, 
JingoliledBethanytathird-place 
finish with a 36-hole score of 163, 
while Mills scored a 166. Jingoli
andMills placed seventh andl2th 
overall, respectively, to earn second-team All-PAC honors. Mills 
also won the long drive champi
onship with a drive of 265 yards.
Other top performers from 
around the league include Thiels 
Steve Menz, Grove Citys Drew 
Moore, W&Js Todd Casey, and 
Carnegie Mellons Doug Reming
ton. Last spring, Thiel finished 
behind Bethany in fourth-place, 
followed by Grove City, Washing
ton and Jefferson and Carnegie 
Mellon.

Youre in a time machine, zooming 
back through the ages, catching 
glimpses of historic events: the fall 
of Troy, the burning of Chicago, the 
discovery of gold at Sutters Mill.
Booth competition in the frater
nity division was tough this year, as 
many houses built sturdy, multiplestory structures that were as chal
lenged to withstand the weekends 
rain as they were to outdo each other.
When the smoke had cleared and 
the chips were down, Phi Kappa 
Thetas Sutters Mill tookfirst prize 
in the division with 758 points. Phi 
Kap was foil owed by Delta Upsilons 
rendition of The Flintstones, with 
721 points, and Sigma Alpha 
Epsilons Lost City of Atlantis," with 
715 points.
The details out of the way, lets 
blast off on our trip though the fra
ternity booths located Somewhere 
in Time:
Ignatius Sasmita/Tartan Asst. Photo Editor 
The brothers of Phi Kappa Theta collected a big pot of gold at Sutters Mill when they placed first 
in the fraternity division.
Phi Kappa Theta
The booth: Eureka! Ive struck 
gold! can be heard coming from 
Sutters Mill. The mill is accurately 
stocked with many fine tools used in 
1849 by the California settlers. All 
the woodwork is impressive, with 
the most striking feature being a 
working water wheel.
The game: You decide to strike it 
rich yourself by panning for gold. 
But you have to be careful of the 
fools gold, so you use your trusty 
gold detector to sort the fools gold 
from the real thing. In the end, if 
youre lucky, you get your own little 
bag of gold.
Phi Kap placed first in the frater
nity division.

Delta Upsilons Bedrock captured second place in the fraternity division 
with a little help from Fred Flintstone and friends.
City of Atlantis. The city is still im
pressive despite the erosion caused 
by many years at the bottom of the 
sea. Broken pillars litter the area 
and towering statues hold up the 
once proud buildings.
The game: At last we find out why 
Atlantis sank into oblivion. You play 
the game of the gods and throw 
massive bean bags onto the tiny island, causing it to sink.
SAE placed third in the fraternity 
division.
The remaining fraternities are 
listed by alphabetical order.

you to his family, his next door neigh

house is an impressive structure 
complete with prehistoric palm tree 
and mailbox. Fred sits out front in 
his car with Dino.
The game: Fred lets you play an

Back to our time machine. On this 
trip, we will get to see the great flood, 
the triumph of the Berlin Wall, a blow 
for independence, an Aztec Temple, 
and the defeat at the Alamo.
Competition in the sorority divi
sion was decided when Chi Omegas 
Noahs Ark sailed away with the top 
honor with 717 points, followed by 
Kappa Kappa Gammas Alamo with 
562 points.
Stay in your seat because here we 
go again.
Chi Omega
The booth: Noah knew it was going 
to rain during Carnival, so he built 
his Ark and gathered two of every 
animal, including; turtles, zebras, 
elephant, lions, and seals. Now, he 
and his friends are waiting for it to 
rain some more.
The game: Man! is that lion hungry, 
and if you dont feed him soon hes 
going to eat one of the mice. When you 
successfully toss him his lunch, the 
mouse gets away and runs down a 
chute and onto a rotating platform. 
Depending on your timing, he can 
either get home, get the cheese, or get 
eaten by the cat.
Kappa Kappa Gamma
The booth: Remember the Alamo! 
cry the sisters. The scene is the stucco 
Alamo, complete with sand, cacti, 
and sombrero wearing Mexicans 
taking their siesta.
The game: Using a spring loaded
launcher, try to get a ping-pong bli 
into one of the sombreros restingupon 
the head of a napping Mexican.
Delta Gamma
The booth: If youd like to stop for a 
cup of tea here, Im afraid youre out ' 
of luck. With the help of the Indians 
the colonists have tossed all of the ta 
into the Boston Harbor. As long as 
were here, we can stand on the deck 
of the clipper ship and watch, or even 
help. i
The game: Finally, after watching 
for a spell, you decide taxation with
out representation is unfair, so you 
pitch in and help throw the tea bags 
overboard and into the tea cups in th'e 
harbor.m j
Delta Delta Delta
T/ieooi/i: Ah, the Will ofthe people 
at work. We arrive just in time to see 
the German people tear down the 
Berlin Wall. The wall showcases a , 
copy of actual graffiti and the infa
mous Checkpoint Charlie.
The Game: Caught up in the enthu
siasm of the moment, you take up 
your pick-axes and help tear down 
the wall by throwing them through 
holes in a rotating wheel.
Kappa Alpha Theta
The booth: On this stop, we get to 
see one of South Americas Aztec 
Temples.
The game:You getto play a game of

Transylvania, revolutionary 
Moscow, war torn Korea, and the 
moon.
Booth competition in the inde
pendent division was marked by 
an impressive array of entries. 
Some booths towered into the 
0stratosphere, displayed intricate 
jj ^.mechanical capabilities, and 
showcased beautiful artwork. 
None the less, all displayed hard 
work and dedication.
^_In only their second year in 
, competition, KGB members captured the first place trophy with 
* -ot^eir Moscow, 1917 with 741 
joints. Landing their lunar mod
ule in second place with Sea of

. of Pioneers with 666 points. And 
ir blasting off from Cape Canav

board.
Carnegie Involvement Asso

The months of preparation before 
Carnival go well for booth builders
By JILL DENESVTCH
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnival has come and gone  
and with the passing of Carnival 
go the booths. However, many are 
oblivious to the hours of work and 
dedication put into these booths 
before Carnival.
Over the past few months, frafratemities, sororits, and other 
booth organizations have put con
siderable time, thought, and 
manual labor into the making of 
their creations. According to CIT 
sophomore Ed Smith, a member 
of the computer club, about 700 
man hours were put into the booth.
Many organizations planned 
their projects well in advance of

the actual Carnival date. Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon started its booth 
over Spring Break. Phi Kappa 
Theta began making plans before 
Christmas break, and started 
building before Spring Break.
SAE almost had a catastrophe 
before Carnival started. While 
transporting its booth from the 
fraternity house to the Midway, 
the booth almost fell. It [the 
booth] was very heavy and it 
started to fall. Fortunately, some 
people from DU came over and 
helped, said junior Matt Ireland.
Chicago Speakeasy  Delta 
Tau Deltas 19 foot booth  and a 
tree were both competing for space 
in the lot. The tree lost. DTD tied 
the tree back so that its booth 
couldfit into its designated space.
Another unexpected problem 
was the power shutoff on Thurs
day. Physical Plant are a bunch 
of weenies, said senior John 
Kaplan.
Phi Kap also had problems with 
the trees. The brothers built their 
booth, Sutters Mill, to the 
maximum height allowedabout 
23 to 24 feetand had to tie back 
some trees that were in the way. 
Their goal was to build the heavi
est booth. Khaled Matar, an 
H&SS junior, said, We have 
heard that there was a heaviest 
booth trophy, and weve decided 
to go for it.
Sigma Tau Gamma had prob
lems with the power system. The 
power from Physical Plant kept 
on sending surges which blew 
several of our circuits, said Paul 
Shore, a junior in H&SS. SigTau 
brothers had planned to have a 
target game using an electronic 
sensor, but they could not rebuild 
a backup in time for Carnival. 
They went with an alternate 
game.
Most of the groups seemed to 
have very little, if any, trouble at 
all. The Computer Clubs presi
dent, ECE junior John Heinlein, 
said the groups only problem 
seemed to be that the parking lot 
was uneven and that caused some 
problems while setting up the 
booth.
The sisters of Delta Delta Delta 
also remarked that they had rela
tively few problems with their 
booth, Berlin Wall. However, 
unlike the fraternities, the so
rorities are located across cam
pus and the distance made booth

ient. Mamie Blake, a freshman, 
said, Our booth wasnt that com
plicated. Everything went fairly 
smoothly.
Delta Gamma had no major 
problems, either. They had been 
planning their booth, Boston 
Harbor, for quite a while and, 
everythings been running 
smoothly, according to senior 
Jeanne Reinhard.
In general, booth builders en
countered few problems during 
the months before Carnival. For 
many, much of the Carnival experience was gained during the 
many hours spent building and 
planning the giant works of art* 
The booths  representing 
months of work  only stood for 
three days, but for the many 
people who enjoyed Carnival, it 
was worth it.

Editor's Note:This is an account of the 
building of the first place independent 
booth by the members of KGB.
All right, everybody know what were 
doing after the meeting? asked junior 
Barry Brumitt, president of KGB, at the 
start of our groups meeting last week.
Those of us who confessed ignorance 
were soon gratified to know that we had 
just volunteered ourselves to spend the 
next six hours of our lives hauling, nail
ing, and painting a variety of oddly cut 
pieces of plywood, chipboard, two-byfours, and dry wall, which, when as
sembled bore an almost startling resem
blance to St. Basils Cathedral, circa 1917. 
Which was fortunate because our theme 
just happened to be Moscow 1917.
We had been planning and working on 
booth for months now, and it had all 
come down to this. At 7:30 pm we would 
be allowed onto our site on the Midway 
so that we could begin final assembly of 
the bits-and-pieces which comprised our 
booth.
The meeting dragged on. Tension was 
etched into the faces of everyone in the 
room, at least everyone who knew what 
we were in for. Finally, the strain was too 
much: two or three members made a 
mad dash for the door and had to be
restrained by our sergeant-at-arms. If 
you were in the room after Brumitt ex
plained what we were up against, you 
were in for the duration.
Finally, with no little trepidation, we 
proceeded into the Dungeon of Marga
ret Morrison. It was the hot and humid 
sub-basement, which Scotch n Soda gra
ciously let us use. We had been doing 
almost all of our construction in it. Whis
tling a spirited rendition of The Liberty 
Bell March, we carried all of our sup
plies out to the hill overlooking the ten
nis courts, to await the inevitable time 
when we were to be allowed on our site.
When we were finally allowed on site, 
we carried our wood to the lot, with much 
less vim and vigor than we had done 
before. It was not so much that we were 
lacking enthusiasm, it was the fact that 
weight has a nasty tendency to increase 
exponentially as a function of distance 
travelled. So by the time we had carried 
the first load the entire distance, my 
arms felt like watery jello, and I could 
empathize very much with Atlas in his 
attempts to carry the Earth on his shoul
ders.
Sophomore Steve Gifford supervised 
the transportation of materials to the 
site, while sophomore Tom Strong and 
senior Dave Markley, the co-designers of 
the booth, supervised on site construc
tion. Since my skill with a hammer is 
limited only to being able to hit myself on
D.A. Henderson/Tartan Asst. Darkroom Manager

booth was a portrait of Lenin.
the finger really well, I opted to assist 
with the transportation of materials.
With every load of materials, I felt 
certain my arms stretched another three 
inches. By the time everything had been 
carried to its appropriate place, my 
knuckles were actually scrapingthe side
walk. Regrettably, we were unable to 
cash in on some of the more practical 
aspects of my five foot arms, since I was 
unable to move or feel them by the end of 
the day.
The next day came much too quickly 
for my tastes. I groggily went through 
my days classes and then proceeded
back to thebooth site. Once there, I com
mented to Gifford that I hadnt gotten 
much sleep the night before. Gifford re
plied that, for him, the night before had 
been thirty-six hours ago. I felt much 
better.
Work proceeded smoothly that eve
ning, our mammoth game was installed. 
Its name was Topple The Czar, and it 
was an impressive bit of equipment. The 
object was to throw bombs, in an at
tempt to knock down the Czar and his 
soldiers. As you did, a picture of St. 
Basils would be transformed into one of 
Lenin. Junior Jon Bennet, the games 
designer, was there making adjustments 
most of the night.
That evening, we also put down the 
floor, and in some places, took it back up 
again. The primary difficulty with that 
was the fact that the palettes, which we 
used to support the floor, were so sturdy 
that it was nigh impossible to drive nails 
into them, or to pull them out if they had 
been positioned incorrectly. But eventu
ally, after many obscenities had filled 
the air, the floor was completed.
Most of the major construction work 
was done by Wednesday, and it was time 
for the artists to step in. Freshman Faye 
Levine, who was in charge of interior 
decor of the booth, had been chomping at 
the bit all week, to be allowed to start 
work on the interior of the booth. She 
had taken me aside earlier that day to
show me the paintings which she had 
done for the booth and I was impressed. 
There were three paintings. One gar
gantuan painting done on canvas, large 
enough to cover an entire wall, and two 
smaller works done on cardboard  all 
exceptional copies of Russian religious 
artwork.
During a lull in the activities, Gifford, 
Strong and I took a walk around Mid
way. Gifford had never seen our booth 
from a distance, and glancing it from in 
between two other booths he exclaimed, 
My God, its beautiful! I was inclined to 
agree. It had an onion dome on each 
comer of the roof, a ten-foot spire in the 
center. The chip-board walls were painted 
to resemble real brick. The front of the 
booth was highlighted by an oil painting 
of Czar Nicholas II done by junior Daniel 
Fahs, (all the more amazing when you-; 
consider it was done from a painting no 
more than an inch long, on a photograph 
of a Faberge Egg). The interior was done 
in ivory and red, with gold trim, and 
stained floors and shelves. It was deco
rated with Russian books, a working 
chandelier, and Levines paintings.
Now that booth is all but a memory, 
KGB is going to take a well deserved 
rest. In the meantime, Im still trying to 
convince them to let me rent the booth as 
an apartment. After all, how many Ameri
cans can say that they live in St. Basils 
Cathedral?

PiKa A starts on hill one with the scent of victory In its grasp.
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Photo Editor
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Spirits three-year reign as mens 
Sweepstakes champion came to an end 
Sunday when Pi Kappa Alpha pulled out 
a .16 second victory. Vengeance, one of 
Pikas two new buggies, rolled a 2:07.05, 
which beat Pikas previous house record 
by a second and a half and completed the 
first three-event sweep in buggy history.
Pikas victory came in true storybook 
fashion. Competing in the fourteenth 
heat of the afternoon, Vengeance took a 
commanding five-second lead over Sigma 
Nus Jama, and played the waiting game 
as Beta and Spirits A teams took shots 
at knocking Vengeance out of the top 
spot. Beta could only muster a 2:19.09, 
setting the stage for a final assault by 
Spirits Tacky on.
They looked good coming out of the 
chute, and I thought it could go either 
way, said Pika Buggy Chair Mike Sundius. However, Spirits final charge came 
up just short as Tachyon finished with a 
time of 2:07.21.
Early on, the situation looked grim for 
Pika when Desperado, the Pika B buggy 
that rolled a 2:10.49 on Friday, was 
disqualified. Desperado would have 
notched a time near 2:08, but Rich 
McCance, Pikas Hill 5 pusher, couldnt 
reach the buggy before it crossed the 
finish line.
Sundius explained the mishap: The 
pusher didnt expect the buggy to go that 
fast, and the driver couldnt see our brake 
flag. The same fate almost befell Venge
ance, but Sundius had already planned 
ahead to avoid a second disqualification.
We planned it out in advance, said 
Sundius. I told her [Vengeance driver 
Darryn Mintz] to slow down if she had 
any problems seeing the brake flag.
Pikas disqualification was just one 
example of the problems experienced in 
Sundays races. A total of 11 buggies 
either spun out, scratched, or were dis
qualified. Beta Buggy Chair Paul Brown
ing, who saw two Beta buggies disquali
fied and another scratched from its heat, 
blamed the mistakes on the lack of prac
tice time, while Sundius said that the 
heat caused a lot of the problems.
Genesis, the Spirit D buggy, gets a push from behind to finish in a dismal 32nd. Spirits 3-year winning streak came to an abrupt stop.Thomas Nichols/Tartan Photo Editor
The key to the weekend was the 
weather; Fridays races were rained out 
after only six heats, and Saturday was 
completely wiped out. Therefore, the 
finals were eliminated, and the results of 
the first round of heats became the final 
Sweepstakes standings. In addition, 
Sundays warm weather caused the 
buggies to roll faster than drivers were 
accustomed to, which led to the increase 
in race incidents.
Most of the groups agreed on the major 
physical problems caused by the delay; 
however, opinions differ slightly about 
how the rainouts affected the teams 
mentally. Zl
Spirit Buggy Chair Terence Yarde said, 
that everyone had a lot of pent-up ag
gression and it seemed to show in the 
races.
On the other hand, Sundius said that 
it calmed me down a lot. I was nervous 
on Friday, but by today, the nerves just 
werent there.
The final standings saw a healthy 
dose of surprises. The A buggies of SDC 
{Terrapin), CIA {Stealth), and Theta Xi 
(Little Nip) all cracked the top ten while 
heavily favored Beta finished twelfth.
This [SDCs sixth place finish] far ,. 
exceeded our expectations, said SDC 
President Eric Hamilton. It was awe=.  
some. TZL
The results of Fridays heats were very ** 
similar to the Sunday results. Phi KapV' 
Tempest, Fringes Lunatic, and Pikas 
seventh-place Predator were the only 
buggies that cut their times significantly, 
while SDCs Mako, Sigma Nus Jerboa, 
and Sig Taus Vindicator suffered the 
only major setbacks from scrapping the 
Friday results.
Vindicator also had the notoriety of 
being the first SigTau buggy ever to race 
in Sweepstakes, and Sig Tau Buggy Chair 
John Hey el was very pleased with his 
teams performance.
We rolled a lot better than I expected 
us to, he said. Wed been getting 2:37 to 
2:40 in practice rolls, so I was really 
pleased with our time [2:31.28].
Sundays first heat was perhaps the 
only race of the afternoon that finished 
completely as expected. SAEs Quasimoto 
won the heat with a 2:25.48, followed by 
Tempest and Stratofortress, the Air Force  
ROTC buggy. Heat 2 gave the first 
indications of the troubles that would 
follow as Betas Challenger was disquali
fied for using a pusher that was not on ' 
the list.
In heat 3, Predator took the lead with r 
a 2:15.69 course time. Pikas lead would 
fall in the next heat as Spirits Quantum 
Leap rolled the course in 2:13.83; -- 
however, Quantum Leap failed its drop  
test, and Predator's lead was reinstated <  
one round later. In addition to Quantum >' > 
Leap, heat 4 saw a solid comeback per-' <" 
formance by ATOs Rebel Yell. The ATO 
buggy turned in a 2:21.35 after blowing 1 
a tire in Fridays race.
Heat 5 began a four-heat streak where 
a buggy was disqualified for crossing the 
finish line without a pushers hand on 
the push bar. DTDs Deception was the 
first victim, followed by Pika {Desper
ado), Sigma Nu {Colugo), and Beta 
{Reignmaker) in heats six, seven, and  
eight, respectively. The strongest per1 
formance of these heats was turned in by 
Delta Upsilon; its buggy, Garganey, 
logged a time of 2:21.30, good enough for 
the top ten at that point.
Heat 9 began a trend toward more 1 
normal races as KDRs A buggy, Prom
etheus, breezed by CIAs Black Magic ;
and SDCs Banzai with a time of 2:17.80. ;
The time was good for second place at the \
time, and would earn KDR eighth place ;
at the end of the day. First place changed

Betas D buggy was a no-show. 
Browning explained that the D 
buggy was sacrificed to supply a 
rear axle for the B buggy and 
therefore could not race. The Pika 
buggy turnedin a 2:19.874, which 
would give Pika its third top-15 
finish for the competition. CIA 
scored big in heat 12 as Black 
Magic notched a fifth-place 
2:14.54 roll, but DTD's Perception 
also turned some heads as it 
cruised to a 2:18.309 that would 
survive for ninth place.
Heat 13 saw another one-buggy 
race as Sigma Nus Jama landed 
a 2:12.871 as the only buggy to 
finish; however, the Pioneers were 
awarded a re-roll as the spinout 
of Phi Kaps Centennial blocked 
their path, giving them grounds 
for a protest; the Pioneers rolled a 
2:21.47 in the re-roll, held be
tween rounds 15 and 16. Heat 14 
belonged to Vengeance, but SDC 
also turned in its sixth place per
formance in the race. The final 
two heats decided the top ten 
teams of the year; Theta Xis 
Nemesis defeated Betas Mercury 
in the closest hill five battle of the 
day, winning by less than half a 
second. Theta Xis 2:18.72 per
formance would be good for tenth 
place as Spirit was the only buggy 
in heat 16 to make the top ten.

stakes 1990 were every bit as 
exciting as always, complete with 
plenty of new buggies, spin-outs, 
and disqualifications.
Although mens races generally 
receive most of the attention and 
hype, the womens teams are 
getting more and more competi
tive. Keeping in tune with the 
drama of the mens races, the 
women of Pi Kappa Alphas rec
ord time of 2:35.6 beat Spirits 
second-place 2:39.7. Spirit lost its 
dominance of the past few years 
to Pika, who also clinched a vic
tory in the mens races.
In order for a womens team to 
qualify, it must place in the top 
six times atthe preliminary races. 
This years finalists were Pika, 
Spirit, Theta Xi, Fringe, CIA, and 
Phi Kappa Theta. Theta Xis 
womens team finished at 2:42.6, 
followed by Fringe A at 2:45.1, 
and CIA A at 2:56.8. Phi Kap did 
not finish the race.
In the first heat of the finals, 
Spirit and CIA raced, with a 27- 
second difference between the 
two. The third heat saw Pika 
come to the finish line a full 10 
seconds before Fringe.
The second heat, however, pro
vided the most excitement, puz
zlement, and controversy of the 
womens races. Phi Kap A, pushed 
up Hills 1 and 2 by seniors Christie 
Noll and Paula Madden, wasneckand-neck with Theta Xi, pushed 
by sophomore Colleen Barkley 
and junior Susan Shimmel, after

eager to make a good showing in 
its first finals appearance in 
several years.

Limo breaks the 6-minute barrier
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
The Ryder truck was surrounded by many 
people. Reporters, SAE brothers and curios
ity seekers crowded around, wondering what 
the top secretish, current eventish theme 
for Limo actually was.
The Sesame Street theme started playing 
and the curtains opened. Five men dressed in 
paint-splattered overalls and gas masks 
jumped out. The curtains closed and someone 
inside called out to the pushers, How are we 
going to get this thing out of here? Its heavy. 
This is how Limo, the comic relief of buggy, 
started its day of racing.
Ernie, the Hill 1 pusher, hoped that hed 
run about 30 feet in just under 17 seconds. 
Eric Gropp, SAE buggy chairman, was proud 
to say that they could easily beat 6 or 7 
buggies. With all of the disqualifications, all 
we would have to do is finish.
The countdown started and the gun went 
off. Fringe Bs and Theta Xi As pushers blew 
right by Limo. Ernie took off after five seconds 
or so. All the way up Hill 1, Ernie had prob
lems staying in his lane.
During the exchange, Ernie collapsed and 
Snuffalophagus, the Hill 2 pusher took over. 
Before the race, he said, Hopefully, I wont 
have to run too far back to catch the buggy. 
Limo disappeared down the hill. About a 
minute later, the Fringe and Theta Xi buggies 
appeared. They finished the race and the 
spectators sat down to wait for the eventual
appearance of Limo.
Three minutes later, a smattering of ap
plause broke out as all five Limo pushers  
Ernie, Snuffalophagus, Kermit, Grover, and 
the Cookie Monster  came up Hill 5 with 
their buggy. Still dressed in overalls and gas 
masks, they carried a Happy Earth Day sign.
The applause grew as Limo struggled up 
the Hill. Limo eventually crossed the finish 
line with the distinction of being the only 
socially conscious buggy.
Right after the race, Grover excitedly said, 
I hear the time to beat was 2:46.1 think we 
got about two hours, 45 minutes and 10 sec
onds.
Gropp proudly said that the race was excel
lent. It was great showing that a buggy built 
out of organic material can race. Our buggy is 
recyclable.
The time for Limo was 5:43.131, one of the 
best times ever for the fourteen-year-old 
buggy.

Designis the most low-key event 
associated with the ulcer creat
ing sport of buggy. This year the 
competition was held on Thurs
day in the gym. Eighteen organi
zation lined up 49 prized buggies 
buffed and painted for display. Of 
these 49 buggies, 15 were sched
uled for private presentation to 
the judges.
Coming out on top in the 1990 
Design Competition was Kappa 
Delta Rhos Prometheus, with a
possible 520 out of 600 points. 
After Prometheus was Phi Kappa 
Th etas entry Secretariat with 495 
points. Third was Sigma Nus 
Jama with 464 points. Jama also 
won the Peoples Choice award.
All of the buggies that raced 
this weekend were on display. 
However, not all are entered into 
design. The reason for this is se
crecy. In order to be judged for 
design, the inner workings of a 
buggy are examined, so many 
organizations do not allow their 
buggies to be judged in order to 
keep their secrets intact.
This year there were six judges 
who included professors from the 
mechanical engineering and de
sign departments, an alumnus 
from Red Zone Robotics, two 
judges from General Motors, and 
one from Chrysler.
In the judging process, each 
organization is allowed a ten 
minute presentation after which 
the judges are allowed five min
utes to ask questions. Buggies 
are judged in the following cate
gories: engineering, innovation, 
integration and appearance. In 
the engineering category the
D.A. Henderson/Tartan photographer 
KDR brothers carry Prometheus, this years best buggy in the design competition.
judges look at the chassis/frame/ 
body, the steering system, the 
braking system, the suspension 
system, and the driver occupance 
and safety. They are judged for 
both the concept and the implem
entation on a scale of one to six. 
The other categories are judged 
on scales of one to ten and one to 
twenty, totalling to 100 possible 
points from each judge.
A buggys appearance does not 
qualify it to win Design Competi
tion, it must be able to perform as 
well. To qualify for Design the 
buggies must place in the top third 
of the Preliminary Race times, or 
in the case of this years Sweep
stakes, the top third overall.
It was a colorful show. Unlike 
other years, the organizations are 
deviating from the color black, 
red, yellows, greens, and blues 
dominated the paint jobs. Fringe 
was by far the most colorful, sport
ing three neon buggies, while 
Kappa Delta Rho continued to be 
the brightest on display with its 
toxic orange. Spirit, Pioneers, 
Alpha Tau Omega, and Kappa 
Sigma obviously had some fun 
with their paint as their buggies 
wore flames, spatter, and graph
ics.
Not to say that everyone broke 
the tradition. Sigma Nu, and Pi 
Kappa Alpha still brought our 
their shiny, black painted fleets, 
and the majority of Theta Xis 
buggies were also black.
The Peoples Choice Award was 
given to Sigma Nus Jama. Each 
vote cost 50 cents, and the public 
was able to vote for anything they 
felt deserved recognition. This 
portion of the competition was 
sponsored by the little sisters of 
Delta Tau Delta.
O ALL 1990 SPRING CARNIVAL BOOTH CHAIRS,

It was a great Carnival. Throughout the good and 
the not-so-good, you were excellent people. 
You made my job enjoyable. Thank you all,

Sure, we know that the major
ity of the students in CFA have 
many artistic talents. They can 
sing and dance, play an instru
ment, design a fashionable build
ing, or rattle off a Shakespeare 
soliloquy faster than you can nam e 
all of Santas reindeer.
But what about the guy in your 
linear algebra class or the girl in 
your physics lecture? What kinds 
of theatrical talents do they hide? 
Scotch n Soda can show you.
As I sat in the ballroom last 
Thursday waiting for the original 
musical Trapped in the Silver 
Screen to begin, two guys behind 
me went through the shows pro
gram name by name. One of them 
was a TA trying to identify each 
cast member by recalling if he 
had ever graded one of their 
homework assignments. He 
seemed to recognize four or five of 
the names. Minutes into the show, 
one of them pointed at an actor on 
stage and whispered to his friend, 
Isnt he a CS major?
With the exception of some of 
the orchestra and crew members, 
those involved in Trapped in the 
Silver Screen were not in CFA. 
They were from different colleges 
and had many different majors, 
but they share an interest in, and 
a talent for, the theater.
Trapped in the Silver Screen 
told the story of screenwriter 
Perry Arnold, whose job depended 
upon his coming up with a script 
for a movie serial that appeals to 
his superiors. He had the main 
idea for the story: Intrepid ex
plorer Teddy Potsdorf and his 
sidekick Pervis McCallistar were 
in the midst of a quest for the Lost 
Eyes of Kalkaput. When Perry 
went to a bar to think about his 
next approach, his own charac
ters showed up and brought him 
to the tropical jungle where he 
and Pervis searched for Teddy, 
who had disappeared. Once they 
found Teddy, they could continue 
looking for the Lost Eyes.
Unspeakably evil Herbert East 
did his damndest to turn Teddys 
sultry love, Eudora Mellon, 
against him and to intercept the 
Lost Eyes. His ultimate goal, 
however, was world destruction.
The acting in Trapped in the 
Silver Screen was unanimously 
strong. Sophomore Mick Sutter
I
gave a wonderfully comic perform - 
ance as preppy Perry Arnold, a 
dishonorably discharged former 
cub scout who now has to cope 
with the terrors of the jungle. 
Sutter had an amazingly diverse 
array of facial expressions. This, 
along with his timid stance and 
shaky voice made his portrayal of 
Perry hysterically funny.
As Herbert East, the master of 
disaster, junior English major 
David Randolph Gross, slithered 
and sneered his way about the 
stage. Herbert was the self-pro
claimed quintessential son-of-abitch and every inch of his per
son oozed evil. Gross did a firstrate job and his rich voice was one 
of the shows best.
Jennifer Adams had been in
volved in the theater for many 
years before she came to Carne
gie Mellon, and it showed in her 
brash performance as Pervis. 
Adams, a freshman, managed a 
perfect mix of her characters 
harsh, no-time-to-waste person
ality that hid her breaking heart.
Sophmore Jessica Bier por
trayed the frustrated and fed-up j 
Eudora Mellon. Her infatuation 
with Teddy was rapidly fading  
when Herbert East dropped by to 
draw out her traitorous instincts. 
Bier was a delight as she struted 
across the stage, teasing and 
seducing, trying to anticipate who 
would get to the Lost Eyes first so 
she could join up with the win
ning side.
Nick Harrigan, a junior in CIT, 
played Teddy Potsdorf like an in
spector Clouseu of the tropics. 
While he stumbled around 
wreaking havoc in his quest for 
the Lost Eyes, he somehow man-_ 
aged to gain admiration, espe3 
cially from Ms creator Perry an3? 
his companion Pervis.

Laser show was a 
feast to the senses
By MICHELLE JONES
Tartan Staffwriter
Whathappens to your imagination when 
you listen to music? Do you imagine your
self at a concert, or cruising in a slick 
sportscar, top down, stereo blasting? Or 
do you just close your eyes and feel the 
music in darkness?
Friday night there was another option: 
watching laser artist Carlyle Osterbergs 
imagination react to selected pieces of 
music, including U2, Yes, and the obliga
tory Pink Floyd.
Yes it did seem like a celebration of 
album rock, complete with festival seat
ing, whistling, and cheers. At first the 
atmosphere was less than perfect. 
Cramped floor space, too many people 
with big hair, too many couples experi
menting with romantic positions, and a 
few people were standing even after the 
house lights went down.
Once things got underway, the annoy
ances faded in comparison with the spi
rals, waves, and other images. It was 
okay, but after a while it all started to look 
like someones homework; graphs in three 
dimensions and rotated axes. The guys 
next to me thought so too; they went so far 
as to speculate on the amplitude and period 
of the sine waves. (Geez, take a break, you 
know, Carnival and all). Fortunately there 
wa s al way s th e opti on of reverting to cl o se d 
eyes and car fantasies.
However, I was soon shaken from my 
vintage Alpha Romeo by laughter. Gone
were the simulations of reflective pools 
and updated lava lamp images. Instead 
there was Einstein, outlined in neon blue, 
changing into a particle, pulsing to what 
might be CMUs unofficial theme song: 
She Blinded Me with Science. The crowd 
(the majority thereof anyway) went wild.
Contrasting with this expression was 
the silence which welcomed icons like the 
continental U.S., the Statue of Liberty 
and the Liberty Bell. In fact the only icon 
which registered anything was that of the 
space shuttle, proof thatmembers of Fringe 
were scattered around the gym.
The show improved after something 
thrown in for you classical musical lov
ers. For one thing, there were lots of 
people in the audience who didnt love, or 
even tolerate, classical music. Their exo
dus made things much nicer. With new
found space, people relaxed and stretched 
out to enjoy the music. Since most of the 
big hair people had left (the one in front of 
me among them), it was indeed possible to 
see the show from a horizontal position.
Lying there listening to Brain Dam
age and Eclipse was soothing, sugges
tive of summer. It was like being out 
under the stars, listening to a great classic 
band running through the hits one more 
time.
However, the peace and relaxation could 
not last forever. Soon the show was over, 
the lights came on, and people began to 
file out into the rain. On that Friday night 
for an hour and a half music took shape, in 
the form of laser beams.
Above: One of the many attractions 
during Spring Carnvial was the arts 
and crafts fair. Several venders 
spread their wares  T-shirts, 
jewelry, buttons, sweatshirts  
among the cut hoping to make a 
sale.
Below: One of the members from 
the CMU crew team proudly 
displays a crew T-shirt, which 
passerbys could have for there 
very own, for a small price.

Michael Sprio plays the tent
By DUSTIN FRAZIER
\Tartan Contributing Editor
Some things never change. 
Take songwriter, singer and 
guitar player Michael Spiro, who 
played the Carnival Tent Friday 
afternoon to a receptive crowd 
~ >hich filled the house. Spiro, like 
fence painting, buggy, and rat 
gazorching, has himself firmly 
planted as a popular Carnegie 
Mellon tradition. He has played 
here every year for the past nine 
/gears, singing for freshmen and 
counselors during orientation or 
entertaining the entire campus 
during Carnival.
This year was no different. His 
performance was pretty much 
^andard fare, but still as enter
taining as ever for those who at
tended. He played his familiar 
mix of humorous songs, quiet 
ballads, and a few not-so-tradijtional renditions of popular folk 
^nd rock verses.
Spiro began his concert as he 
always does, with his own per
sonal anthem Im a One Man 
Guy. From the start, he let the 
audience know what was in store. 
^Vhen Im through, youll know 
st where I stand, are the lyrics, 
and his music followed those 
words to a tee.
His concerts have always re
vealed a great deal about his most 
personal thoughts. After all, what 
could be more personal than his 
three favorite things in life, 
Music, Sex and Cookies? He 
performed this old favorite and 
got the traditional enthusiastic 
Response from the audience.
He also sang a few of his favor
ite folk melodies, including When 
the Spirit Says Sing, Life is 
Hard, and From a Distance. 
Spiro managed to work his own 
style of singing and guitar playg into these in a way which was 
interesting and very entertaintog, even inspiring at times.
After singing a few melodies 
with his electric acoustic guitar, 
he switched to a traditional elecf ic and sang 1000 Cranes, a 
haunting piece about a Japanese 
|&irl who died as a late victim of 
ie bombing of Hiroshima during 
World War II. It was beautifully
Vpu:

Singer, songwriter, and guitar player Michael Spiro preformed to a 
capacity crowd in the tent last Friday afternoon.
done, and the audience was 
quickly drawn in to the soulful 
story.
At another point in the concert, 
Michael Spiro told the crowd that 
he likes to take requests but has 
a few songs which he refuses to 
perform without modification. 
With this in mind, he proceeded 
to do his own version of Don 
McClains American Pie, which 
he twisted into his own The Day 
my Diet Died.
He also recreated his dream 
of performing as Jimmy Page of 
Led Zeppelin and forgetting the 
words to the groups eternal hit 
Stairway to Heaven. When he 
finally ended up singing the 
Gilligans Island theme to this 
classic rock melody, the crowd 
just roared. Later in the concert, 
he sang his ever-popular The 
Folky, which is musically based 
on Simon and Garfunkles tune 
The Boxer.
Although he claims to be a one 
man guy, he is married and has 
a new-born set of twin boys. Early 
in the concert, he sang a soothing 
melody to his sons, softly titled 
My Dancing Boys. Then later in 
the afternoon, he brought his wife 
and two new sons on stage for the 
audience to see. When his sons
were not trying to eat the micro
phones, he and his wife sang a 
wanning duet about their new 
family entitled (We fit together 
like) Spoons.
Spiro closed the concert with an 
encore performance of Going 
Through the Motions, an origi
nal, melancholy tune ringing of 
echoed electric guitar and the 
familiar theme of true love lost.
I would have liked to have heard 
some new original tunes, perhaps 
ones which told us a bit more 
about the recent changes in his 
life. Unfortunately, the only addi
tions to his usual set were not 
originals, but songs which he 
borrowed from other popular folk 
guitar players.
He hasnt come out with a new 
album for at least three years, 
and it seems that he has now 
resorted to selling cookies with 
his albums as an incentive to buy. 
Well give you the music and the 
cookies, but the rest is up to you, 
was his humorous promotion.
Still, Spiro seems very happy 
with his present repertoire, and 
the crowd was obviously satisfied 
with the familiarity of it all. He 
will undoubtedly continue to en
tertain Carnegie Mellon students 
for years to come.
Bob Hop was one of four local bands which performed in the tent during Carnival weekend.
Couples danced the night away during the 
highly successful AB Swing Dance last 
Saturday night.

Among the many events kicking off 
Spring Carnival 1990 on Thursday was 
the Department of Musics Contempo
rary Ensemble Concert at the Alumni 
Concert Hall. As compaired to the other 
events occurring during that evening, 
this was perhaps the most cultural and 
the cheapest. The dress was formal, 
though some students attended in shorts. 
The Ensemble began promptly at 8 pm 
and seemed very professional.
Artistic director for the concert was 
Leonardo Balada, the music director and
conductor was Eduardo Alonso-Crespo, 
and the assisant conductor was Gilbert 
Rose. There were to be five presenta
tions by the Ensemble.
The first presentation was written by 
Amanda Dixon and had two movements. 
She explained: it was based on Psalm 
XXVII and said, and with my song will 
I praise Him. The Ensemble consisted 
of two violins, viola, cello, bass, and 
piano and two movements represented 
her piece. I enjoyed her presentation 
thoroughly; it was soothing, calming 
and quite a change of pace from normal 
music.
Mark Kirschenmann presented the
next piece, performed by a string quar
tet. His piece was unique and refresh
ing. It was different in nature; than 
Dixons presentation, providing a nice 
contrast.
Christopher Capizzi presented the next 
piece October. The text for the mixed 
choir was by William Everson. AlonsoCrespo was the conductor. Alonso-Cre
spo did a find job of conducting for this 
piece, sweeping the audience into feel
ing the musical vibrations emanating 
from the instruments.
An intermission followed these three 
presentations, permitting the audience 
to unwind and allow the music of the
evening to really sink in. Armando Luna 
Ponce introduced a wind quartet per
formed by flute, oboe, clarinet and bas
soon. The four components were 
Preludio, Tarantella, Aria, and Tocatta, 
respectively. Gilbert Rose also did an 
excellent job of conducting for these 
pieces. The performance of the wind 
quartet was truly enjoyable, as the sooth
ing nature of the piece also enhanced the 
enjoyment of the music.
The final presentation of the night 
was by Keith V. A. Bajura. It was Forest 
Songs, performed by oboe, bassoon, 
french horn, percussion, piano, violin, 
and cello. Forest Songs was made up of
five movements: Awake, the sun rise!, 
Lament of a small forest creature, Dance 
of the sprites; or Theme and mutilations, 
Rain Song of the marsh reeds, and Evef 
ning hoedown. Bajuras piece was vejy 
unique and interesting. The way the 1 
piece was constructed was impressive. 
The general structure and flow of lie 
music was harmonious. Everything just 
clicked. Again, Alonso-Crespo did a super ^ 
job of conducting the piece and main
taining that delicate control so needed 
for music to come across poetically.
Overall, the evenings was most im
pressive. The Music Department can be ; 
proud of yet another fine presentation, ,

Tennessee-bred comedian Henry Cho kept a packed Tent enthralled Saturday night with these faces, among others.

Imagine a grown-up, beerdrinking, smart  alec Bart 
Simpson, but with a Korean face 
and the thickest down-home 
southern accent imaginable.
Sound ridiculous? Maybe, but 
its a perfect description of the 
style of up-and-coming comedian 
Henry Cho.
The 28-year old performer 
played to what was by far the 
largest crowd under the Tent at 
this years Spring Carnival. The 
place was standing-room-only 
Saturday night as everyone 
craned their necks to try and catch 
a glimpse of his unique combina
tion of genes and jeans.
Henry Cho, or Hank to some 
of his close friends, was born and 
raised as a full-blooded Korean in 
the southern state of Tennessee. 
And from the sound of it, he had a 
pretty typical American child
hood, despite his seemingly 
strange situation.
Cho was a perfect performer for 
the college crowd  on stage 
wearing blue jeans, a rugby shirt,
Henry Cho/Special to The Tartan 
Cho stole Tartan Photo Editor 
Thomas Nichols camera long 
enough to shoot off a few pictures 
of the audience and this one of his 
boot.
cowboy boots and carrying a Coors 
can (full, of course) for most of the 
show, he fit right in and seemed 
to know everything about how 
college students think and act.
His topics were familiar, but 
the material was fresh and his 
views distinctly southern. He 
joked about his favorite childhood 
pranks, college life, women, 
sports, and took particular pleas
ure in picking on some of his old 
buddies from school. His friend
J. B. (a.k.a. Jonly Bonly) took 
most of the heat for being what 
Cho called The stupidest guy Ive 
every known.
Cho did a great job of playing on 
familiar situations which all of us 
have been in at one time or an
other. Ever eaten a bouillon cube 
thinking it was candy? Ever tasted 
Hersheys baking chocolate when 
you were a kid? Hank has, and 
theres plenty of these situations 
in his bag of embarrassing mo
ments from his early years.
Many of his jokes were actually 
informative. Id never thought of 
putting lighter fluid in a squirt 
gun and torching Halloween 
pumpkins with it, but Cho and 
his childhood pals did it years 
ago. Ever wondered how much it 
would cost to mail a drunk friend 
from his bachelor party in Ten
nessee to Denver, Colorado via 
Federal Express? Ahundred and 
twenty-five bucks, a bottle of 
Gatoraid (empty of course), some 
bananas, and boom, Jeff was in 
Denver, Cho railed. Needless to 
say, they didnt have the wedding 
until Sunday, and we sure as hell 
werent in it!
A few of his jokes were pretty 
subtle (Man these lights are 
bright. Im squinting up here  
trust me), but he was always 
quick to thank the few people who 
did manage to pick up on some of 
his more obscure stuff. Thanks 
for gettin that, hed say, then 
take another swig of Coors beer 
and start ranting about pranks 
he and his buddies pulled of when 
they were kids or how he always 
tried to pick up on women at col
lege parties.
At one point in the show, he 
stopped to ask the audience what 
people did around here for fun. 
When one person shouted 
Buggy! he spent the next few 
minutes trying to figure out just 
what Buggy is. Ever tried explain
ing buggy to a non-CMU friend? 
Its just about impossible, but 
seeing three hundred students

Nationally-known alternative 
music band Oingo Boingo ended 
Spring Carnival 1990 festivities 
with a bang. The band began 
playing at 3:15 on Sunday on a 
bandstand situated in the middle 
of the Cut.
The band drew a very large 
audience ranging from alumni to 
current students. Although the 
concert was delayed for 45 min
utes due to technical difficulties, 
the audience did not seem to mind 
being kept waiting. Several stu
dents remarked that the concert 
was well worth the wait.
Oingo Boingo played almost 
twenty different songs in a con
cert which lasted for well over an 
hour. Most of the music was char
acterized by a strong bass beat 
which made it extremely danceable. In fact, scores of students 
began to dance on the Cut next to 
either side of the bandstand.
The bands opening number, 
Dead Mans Party, put the 
audience into a festive mood. As 
the show continued, more and 
more people began fill up the 
already crowded Cut and listen to 
the band, perhaps because of the 
music or perhaps simply because 
the weather was perfect for an 
outdoor concert.
Danny Elfman, Oingo Boingos 
lead vocalist, presented renditions 
of some of the bands older tunes, 
including Who do you want to 
be? and Just Another Day. 
Some of the newer music which 
the band played included Is it 
dead? and Help.
Composed of eight members, the 
band could be heard loud and 
clear throughout the campus. The 
group members used innovative 
musical techniques with instruIgnatius Samsita/Tartan Asst. Photo Ecfl&r
Sunday afternoon the music of 
Oingo Boingo filled the Cut and 
ended Spring Carnival 1990 on-a 
high note. jLfi
ments like the xylophone.
The lead singers voice could 
emanate a wide range of sounds 
from high pitched screams to more^ 
sedate low notes. The band some; 
times sounded much like Britains 
Roxy Music, a group which influx 
enced Oingo Boingos technique,# 
great deal. However, the band 
definitely displays its own unique 
style.
The bands popularity during 
the 1980s can be traced to movie 
soundtracks such as Weird Sci
ence and Bachelor Party. Although 
the band achieved popularity from 
these Soundtracks, the popular 
music scene is really not their 
style.
Elfman and the remaining band 
members closed out the concert 
with the appropriately titled song 
Goodbye. The band was ex-? 
tremely well received by the 
Carnegie Mellon audience and 
were given a standing ovation 
many listeners.

In the middle of all the bustle 
and din of Spring Carnival 1990, 
there were these five, brave old 
guys dressed up as matadors. 
There they were, sitting pretty in 
the eye of the hurricane, chilling 
out with a few good Mexican tunes.
These were the men of the 
Mariachi Band, playingtunes that 
made your mouths water for some 
nachos and salsa.
The band was positioned, ironi
cally, next to ATOs water balloon 
booth, on the comer stage. It made 
for good humor, for if you stayed 
there long enough it seemed that 
the beat of the water balloons 
hitting plywood paralleled, in an 
ethereal sort of way, the ethnic 
strumming of los amigos Mari
achi.
Most of the people who walked 
by treated the Mariachi Band like 
pleasant background noise. Itwas 
rather difficult to stand in one 
place, especially to watch a band 
of five shivering guys while a 
current of Carnival-goer flesh 
threatens to wash you away to
the next booth.
So los amigos stayed up there, 
and braved the lonely night, pray
ing that someone would hear their 
tunes. Nobody stayed, and the 
aura of a dream deferred sank in, 
tainting the tunes that Id heard 
on many a Bugs Bunny cartoon.
But then, someone stood against 
the tide. Anchored onto her 
daddys arm, a little girl wearing 
patent leather shoes proclaimed, 
I wanna stay. Her father hap
pily granted her wish, went over 
to the lead singer, and requested 
a tune. The girl impatiently 
wriggled in her fathers arms as 
he whispered something to the 
kind, gentle hombre.
Either he couldnt hear over the 
roar of the human sea or he didnt 
understand English, but the lead 
singers response to the fathers 
request remained a staunch 
huh? It didnt matter. With a 
smile the lead singer took his 
comrades, they huddled at the 
back of the stage, picked a ran
dom tune out of a big red book, 
tuned their instruments, andsaid 
after a long silence, We are 
ready.
Bom again they were, like the 
phoenix rising from the ashes. 
The Mariachi Band spread its 
wings and proclaimed to the 
world, I am.The color seemed to 
return to their faces. The zip in 
their plucking was back. Their 
sombreros literally glowed under 
the radiance of the stage lights. 
Indeed, for these five men dressed 
in black, it was a magical mo
ment.
The child seemed intoxicated 
by the beautiful ballad that slowly 
warmed the brisk evening air. 
The baldingyuppie father started 
dancing around with his smiling 
daughter as a crowd of little chil
dren began to gather. Yes, it was 
a Norman Rockwell  no  a 
Kodak moment.
People went about their busi
ness, more water balloons from 
next door exploded, the crowd 
ended up being only a transient 
thing, and the little girl eventu
ally disappeared. The Mariachi 
Band went back into dormancy, 
but it didnt matter anymore. For 
they had done what every per
former wants to do  they had 
given the gift of joy.

It looks like some of CMUs 
fastest eaters will be walking 
around with red faces for the next 
few days. The reason? Fridays 
Tri Delta and NROTC So ... You 
Think You Can Eat Fast co-spon
sored event.
The object of the competition 
 was easy, to eat cherry jello as 
fast as possible. However, one 
simple rule made the task a little 
bit more difficult  contestants 
were not allowed to use their 
hands.
The competition was split up 
into two groups, individual and 
three man teams. Teams had to 
eat ten Styrofoam bowls fall of 
cherryjello, while individuals only 
had to eat five. In addition, only 
; one team mimber was permitted 
to snarf jello at a time.
In the individual heat six par
ticipants competed against each 
other, the winner being the one 
with the fastest time. As for the 
teams, ther^ were four team heats 
'where five teams competed 
against each other at one time. 
The five teams which had the 
fastest times from the first four 
heats then competed against each 
. other, for the championship, this 
'time eating eight bowls of jello.
The heats were a little bit like 
tag team snarfing. Whenever a 
team member couldnt eat any
more, he or she tagged off to 
another member to take over. 
That member then tagged off to 
the third, the third back to the 
first, and so on.
Approximately twenty teams of 
three and six individual partici
pants showed their talents in the 
graceful art in jello snarfing. Most 
team names were rather eccen
tric, such as the Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Tri Delts, I Cant Believe 
Im Doing This, Suck and Swal
low, and Mudge Munchers.
Over all, the fastest group and 
winner the $100 prize, was the

UL6The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 April 1990
Like buggy, T-shirts 
are taken seriously
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Staffwriter
In the midst of the frenzied cataclysm 
of activity that is Carnival, one might 
expect the typical reaction to as rela
tively mundane and uninspiring an event 
as a T-shirt contest to be something 
along the lines of big hairy, flagellating 
whoop.
But this T-shirt contest, like every
thing Carnival-related, was frivolous
ness taken very seriously. Taken seri
ously, at least, by the dozen or so organi
zations whose works lined the spacious 
Wherrett Room, vying for the scrupu
lous attention of the judges with bright 
colors, quaint logos, and more violations 
of Warner Brothers copyrights than you 
could heave a Ferris Wheel at.
Each T-shirt belonged to one of the 
categories of Buggy and Booth, depend
ing upon which activity it heralded. 
Winners were to be chosen from each of 
the two groups, and one lucky shirt would 
walk away (figuratively speaking, of 
course) endowed with the Chairmans 
Choice Award as well. The originators of 
these artistic articles were, by and large, 
the same groups behind the various 
activities outside, including organiza
tions such as CIA, the Pioneers, the Air 
Force ROTC and the typical slew of fra
ternities.
And what of the shirts themselves? 
Although the unmistakable Fruit-of-theLoom labels sapped some of the dignity 
of the whole affair, the designs them
selves were clearly of professional qual
ity, or thereabouts. Most of the shirts 
were somewhat sparsely laid out, con
sisting of perhaps a small logo or figure 
quietly biding its time in an isolated 
corner amidst a sea of solid color. Many, 
however, were more intricate and imagi
native, ranging from portrayals of Her
culean buggy racers to illustrations of
As The Tartan went to press late 
Sunday, the T-shirt judging contest 
had been delayed by the Carnival 
Committee until an undetermined 
time later this week because of 
discrepancies with several of the 
entrants.
the various booth themes and activities 
that the groups were perpetrating out in 
the parking lot.
Indeed, the room itself almost seemed 
like a pithy summary of the ongoing 
festivities, recorded forever in the me
dium of cotton. Relying upon the inher
ent eye-catching qualities of cartoon char
acters, Kappa Sigmas shirt featured the 
Martian of Bugs Bunny fame overlook
ing a representation of the houses booth, 
emblazoned with the warning Beware 
of Greeks bearing gifts bearing Greeks. 
Delta Tau Delta had an elaborate styl
ized depiction of the a scene from a 1920s 
Chicago bar, as befitted its booths theme. 
And the obligatory sexual innuendos 
were present as well, courtesy of the 
Pioneers, whose shirt sported a pano
ramic illustration of the surface of the 
moon, replete with lander, boasting that 
We were the first to get it up.
In truth, the whole ordeal wasntnearly 
as exciting as Im trying to make it seem. 
But as T-shirt contests go, this was cer
tainly among the more interesting speci
mens that one could hope to encounter, 
and the entrants had their diligent and 
highly-professional efforts recognized 
and rewarded outside their native or
ganizations.
Truly, it was a significant occasion for 
wearers of stylish and eye-catching slo
gans everywhere, and a proverbial pat 
on the back for those inventive souls who 
litter the organizations of Carnegie 
Mellon.

Carnegie Mellons very own Kiltie Band 
kicked off the Carnival festivities last 
Thursday with a set of six rousing and 
traditional tunes. Inside a tent stationed 
out on the Cut, the Band kept its songs 
coming for approximately forty-five 
minutes. At first, Kiltie Band drew only 
a modest audience, but as the strains of 
its music floated outside the tent, more 
and more curious passerbys strolled 
inside to check out the gathering.
Those who did not make it over to the 
tent could still easily hear the music 
thanks to a number of speakers spread 
out across the campus. The bands spir
ited music succeeded in creating a fes
tive mood among the carnival crowd.
Decked in traditional Scottish garb  
tartan kilts and red jackets  the band 
entertained the crowd with enthusiasm.

wete hilarious, like a pair of weasels personified.
The music in Trapped in the Silver Screen was just 
terrific. Musical directors Jesse Ramey, a Junior Hisjory major, and Junior English major Jeff Muller con
ducted the orchestra beautifully, from the popular tune 
Master of Disaster to the quieter songs like Abu 
Dhabi, the music and lyrics were delightful and 
memorable.
Credit also goes to Junior Javier Grillo-Marxuach, 
vho labored over the script for the show. GrilloMarxuach showed a great sense of pure comedy  the 
last scene in the restaurant was hilarious  as well as 
a flair for the off-beat and thoroughly original.
Set designers transformed the back of the ballroom 
into a thick and steamy jungle. Set changes involved 
*he addition of furniture, but the lush jungle setting re
mains in the background.
Director Nancy Gleason, a junior, managed to pull all 
of these elements together to create the finished show. 
And what a show! This show rose far above what you 
normally see in professional comic markets. I hope that 
knyone who appreciates an evening of laughter man
aged to get over to see Trapped in the Silver Screen.

Steel drums 
rock the Midway
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Staffwriter
Steel drums. Oh, sure. You 
know the deal. A couple of blearyeyed inebriates with slurred, 
twangy accents pounding monoto
nously on an assortment of alu
minum cans and garbage lids, 
while howling out the occasional 
grunt or carnal monosyllable, 
right?
Well, thats what I thought, 
anyway. But as it turned out, the 
Dynamic Steel Orchestra, one of 
the Activity Boards many spiffic 
contributions to the festivities at 
Carnival, wasnt just another 
generic psuedo-Carribean export, 
but an entertaining group that 
brings this unique for of music 
gracefully into the 90s.
As is appropriate for CMU, 
Dynamic Steel actually utilized 
some modem technology in their 
act. They had a fairly elaborate 
sound system, and a collection of 
drum machines to back up their 
musical efforts. (That they didnt 
resort to the sickening fly swatter 
blips of Casiotone keyboards so 
common to this genres mode of 
performance sent a warm sense 
of relief flooding through my 
veins.) Whats even more unique 
about this group is that theyre a 
local effort, so dyed-in-the-steelwool Pittsburghers can feel proud 
of their citys contribution to the 
worlds exotic music scene.
Although the air was damp, and 
drizzle splattered gloomily on the 
patrons of Boothland on Friday, 
the populace began to cluster in 
anticipation even while the boys 
were just warming up. As one 
randomly quoted bystander elo
quently put it, When these guys 
start jamming, Im gonna be 
hanging out here.
And indeed, as the band started 
its performance, people began to 
collect at the little corner in 
droves, pausing amidst their cel
ebratory frenzy like leaves stuck 
to a branch on their way down
stream. The drum machines 
started their percussive clatter, 
and suddenly the air was alive 
with the melodic chiming and 
clanging of steel drums. The music 
was full of that offbeat, swaying 
repetitive cheerfulness that char
acterizes this breed of sonorous 
entreatment.
The two-man band, comprised 
of Chris Nowell and Isaac Wal
lace, proceeded to serenade the 
crowd with a variety of pieces, in 
doing so showing a surprising 
amount of diversity (which, in the 
context of a steel drum band, 
means playing anything thats not 
Calypso).
The lay crowd was probably 
incapable ofdistinguishingallthe 
subtle variations in the intricate 
jams, or for that matter, any of 
the songs from one another. But 
who cares? The tunes were perky, 
pleasantly upbeat, unthreatening, and unpretentious. The music 
flooded the region around the 
comer stage, the crowd was en
tertained, and the denizens of 
nearby booths bobbed their heads 
to the beat and contributed inau
dible air-drum fills.
So chalk up another successful 
effort to AB, and remember Dy
namic Steel Orchestra and their 
amusing melodic mellowness 
when you reminisce about Carni
val in future days.

L18 The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 April 1990
Rides center around standard Carnival theme
By AS. GOLDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
And so, through their tedious 
weekdays, they make a carnival of 
grief.
Maxim Gorki
It was with great enthusiasm 
that I, the powerful and revered 
amusement park critic, accepted 
the assignment of reviewing the 
rides at the 1990 Spring Carni
val. But, alas, my good humor 
turned sour as I stepped onto the 
Midway only to see one of the 
most wretched displays of ama
teur carnivalia this critichas ever 
witnessed. The Zipper, The Tem
pest, The Flying Bobs, The 
Roundup, and The Skydiver: All 
in all, a lackluster rehash of some 
rather antiquated and tired 
church-festival archetypes. Who 
do these carnival charlatans think 
they are fooling by calling their 
third-rate Ferris Wheel The 
Skydiver? Carnival 1990, it is 
sad to say, fell way short of this 
critics expectations by relying
almost exclusively on standard 
carnival fare.
The Zipper and The Tempest 
were the first of the ridt)s I 
sampled, and a disheartening 
foretaste of what was to come. 
With both rides, I found the inces
sant undulation and rotation of 
my carriage to be somewhat 
vague: just what was the intended 
outcome of the frenzy of motion?  
Excitement, fear, nausea? I can
not say.
The Zipper and The Tempest 
never make their motives clear, 
leaving the rider to contemplate 
the experience without an inti
mation of the true essence of the 
ride. I stepped out of my carriage 
rather depressed and confused. 
What is The Zipper trying to say, 
and why is its message so cryptic?
Although the Flying Bobs made 
a more lucid statement, the over
all triviality of the subject matter 
makes this a drawback rather 
than an asset. The Bobs wallows 
in thekind of pseudo-moral cliches 
that are laughably out of place in 
the context of a Springbacchanal
such as this. The rides entreaty 
to Stay on the right track is 
hackneyed, ineffectual and meta
phorically unsophisticated. Save 
this one for the kiddie park, says 
the powerful and revered amuse
ment park critic.
The Skydiver further speeded 
my descent into carnival dissolu
tion, but with a nefarious twist. 
What was at first an uninspiring 
ride on a traditional Ferris Wheel, 
became (quite unintentionally, I 
must add) one of the most har
rowing amusement park experi
ences of my career.
As an optimistic affirmation of 
the endless cycles that pervade 
our common human endeavor, 
The Skydiver fails. Instead, 
through technical problems and 
erratic forward motion, the ride 
became horrific existentialist 
comment on mans lack of control 
over his own life. Enough! 
Enough! I am responsible for my 
life! Stop! I cried to the operator 
when I realized that I had been 
trapped on some absurdist night
mare of a ride. But he would not
listen, and this only added to the 
terror of the experience.
The Roundup, my last ride of 
the day, did nothing to assuage 
my already battered spirit. Work
ing of the theme of The Skydiver, 
The Roundup stresses the futility 
and danger of fighting the sys
tem. Pinned up against a pad by 
the force of gravity, one feels 
absolutely helpless and terrified 
at the inability to move freely. 
The awful catch is that even if one 
can muster enough strength to 
break through the g-force, the 
passenger would then be cata
pulted through the air, eventu
ally falling into a broken heap in 
th e Skibo parking lot. The irony is 
overwhelming.
Someone once said Life would 
be tolerable were it not for its 
amusements. How true! The 
rides of Carnival 1990 support 
this claim through its disenchant
ing commingling of the banal and 
the horrific. If amusement is the 
happiness of those who cannot 
think, as Pope says it is, I think 
I agree.
Stephen Kang/Tartan Pho
The Skydiver was one of the many rides that the powerful and revered 
amusement park critic rode on during Carnival.
