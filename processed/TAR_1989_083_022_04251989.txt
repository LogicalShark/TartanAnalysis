After a week that saw two 
candidates withdraw from the 
Presidential race, elections for 
Student Government President 
will be held today and tomorrow 
in front of Doherty Hall.
Sophomores Mike Ference 
and Mark Mittelhauser remain 
in the race. Announcements of 
withdrawal came from Sopho
more Marc Roston and Junior 
Mike Drout minutes after Fer
ence had been endorsed by the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
Wednesday.
Drout telephoned The Tartan 
early Thursday morning to 
announce his withdrawal, for 
what he called personal rea
sons.
Drout later told The Tartan 
that the biggest reasons for my 
withdrawal are personal rea
sons that I dont want to talk 
about. I felt I could support Mike 
Ference to get done what I 
wanted to get done. So its with 
good conscience that I support 
Ference. Next semester is going 
to be very important for grades, 
and Im going to concentrate on 
classes.
Roston withdrew as of 2:00 
am Thursday. He indicated that 
the endorsement of powerful 
campus groups was more im
portant than the issues of the 
campaign. Basically, my rea
son for dropping was that Fer
ence got the CFP endorsement. 
An important factor in my
campaign was CFP backing. 
The way I see it, these elections 
have no real issues. Were all 
students here; theres no con
troversy in what we want. Th 
most important thing for m 
was to get CFP backing. What 
made me different was my 
method of solving the issues 
and not the issues themselves.
Roston went on to throw his 
support behind Mittelhauser. 
Mittelhauser is far more quali
fied. Ference has no experi
ence at all. Mittelhauser has 
better ideas. Ference has good 
advisors, if you want to call 
them that, but were electing a 
president, not a board of advi
sors.

Carnegie Mellon may soon have a stu
dent honor code, if certain members of 
Student and Faculty Senate get their way.
Last semester, both senates discussed 
the issue of an honor code. The topic was 
also brought up this semester during fac
ulty/student lunches held in February and 
March.
According to Mark Steppel, chair of the 
Academic Affairs Committee of Student 
Senate, the Academic Affairs Committee 
looked into the idea of an honor code briefly 
and decided that the issue was too large to 
be accomplished singlehandedly.
The committee made the decision to set 
up an Honor Code Task Force which will 
consist of five students, two faculty mem
bers (one of which will be from Faculty 
Senates Educational Affairs Council), and
three administrators. These ten people will 
select two other faculty members to help 
with the study.
The first goal of the task force will be to 
determine if an honor code is appropriate. 
This step, says Steppel, will include some 
type of survey of the student body, al
though he is not sure what form the survey 
will take.
If it decides that a code is unnecessary, 
the committee will issue a report detailing
its conclusions.
If, on the other hand, the committee sees 
a need for an honor code, it will proceed by 
obtaining opinions on the honor code and 
drafting an initial version. At this point, 
the task force would try to get the honor 
code adopted by students, faculty, and 
President Cyert. Steppel feels the process 
would take at least a year.

A campus-wide referendum will 
decide the fate of a controversial 
proposal to kick back 37 percent 
of the activities fees paid by Greek 
members to the Council of Fra
ternity Presidents and Panhel, 
Student Senate decreed last week.
Although Senate debated add
ing the referendum to the elec
tions for student government of
fices which are being held today 
and tomorrow, it decided later 
that voting on the binding referendum will be held next Tuesday 
and Wednesday outside of 
Doherty Hall.
CFP President Phil Antonson 
presented the Senate with the 
one-page proposal and a petition 
signed by over 250 Greeks last 
Tuesday.
By the student government 
constitution, any petition that 
calls for a restriction of current 
Senate policy and is signed by 
more than 250 activities-fee pay
ing students requires Senate to 
open the?issue up to campus-wide 
balloting in a binding referendum.
In word, this petition is not a 
restraining petition per se, Sena
tor Frank Di Vito told Senate. But 
in reality, this proposal, if ap
proved, would leave us with two 
options: one, to slash the [student 
organization] budgets we passed 
a few weeks ago and are going to 
pass next semester; or two, wed 
have to dip into the reserve we 
have in a way were not supposed 
to do. DiVito is the chair of Sen
ates Funding and Recognition 
Committee and therefore is re
sponsible for the budgets of all 
funded organizations.
The Greek proposal calls for the 
return to CFP and Panhel of 
$14.80 of the $40 semesterly ac
tivities fee paid by each fraternity 
and sorority member. It would 
result in the reduction of over 
$38,000 annually in Student 
Senates budget, or about nine 
percent of the total monies avail
able to activities-fee-sponsored or
ganizations.
The Graduate Student Organi
zation already receives 37 per
cent of all graduate student ac
tivities fees, a policy that was set 
a number of years ago with the
rationale that graduate students 
generally do not participate in 
undergraduate activities. This, 
year, Senate kicked back an esti
mated $58,000 to GSO.
The rationale behind the kickback, according to the proposal, is 
that Greek use of the activities 
fee is limited mainly to campus 
films, lectures, and Spring Carni
val events. As a result, say 
Greeks, CFP and Panhel should 
receive some of the activities fee 
money back.
However, the proposal is not

Mike Steidel is concerned about 
his alma mater  it is experiencing 
a new low in applications to its engi
neering and computer science de
partment.
Steidels involvement with the 
problem is far more than simply 
casual concern, however: The school 
in question is Carnegie Mellon, and 
Steidel is currently director of ad
missions.
According to the latest figures from 
the Admissions Office, the number 
of applications to CIT is on a down
ward slope. Applications for next fall 
stand at 2192, down 5% from last 
years total. Whats more, the num
ber represents a decline of over 12% 
from 1987.
A 1978 graduate in Chemical 
Engineering and Business Admini
stration and Management Sciences 
(now known as Industrial Manage
ment), Steidel is a personification of 
the shift away from technical fields.
Steidel equates the decline in tech

Thomas Murrin, Carnegie Mellons Distin
guished Service Professor in Technology and 
Management, is being considered for a highlevel post in the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
according to a report in last Thursdays Pitts
burgh Press.
The reports surfaced after posters for a panel 
discussion on global competitiveness described 
Murrin as Deputy Secretary Designate, U.S. 
Department of Commerce.
However, when contacted by The Tartan, 
Murrins only comment was I can not give any 
information on that. According the Press ar
ticle, no comment has come from the White 
House either.
According to a University spokeswoman, it 
was Murrins office at Westinghouse which re
quested Murrin be described as the designee. 
Murrin, a former vice president of Westinghouse 
Electric Corp., still maintains an office at the 
Pittsburgh-based corporation.
If Murrin receives the post described, he would 
have the second highest position in the Com
merce Department and would have to be con
firmed by the U.S. Senate.
Murrin was thrust into the spotlight because 
of his role as moderator in a panel discussion of 
global competitiveness in the next decade. Three 
speakers gave competitive strategies from 
American, European, and Japanese points of 
view.

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador 
(AP)Attorney General Roberto 
Garcia Alvarado was assassinated 
Thursday by unidentified assail
ants as he drove to his office in the 
capital.
A bomb was placed on the roof 
of Garcias J eep Cherokee when it 
stopped at a traffic light, accord
ing to Oscar Orellana, the attor
ney generals driver. Garcia, 53, 
also was accompanied by a body
guard at the time of the attack.
Neither the driver nor the body
guard was visibly wounded, 
though both complained of par
tial deafness from the blast.
No group immediately claimed 
responsibility for the attack. 
However, President-elect Alfredo 
Cristiani blamed leftist guerril
las battling the U.S.-backed gov
ernment.
In Washington, the State De
partment condemned the assas
sination of El Salvadors attorney 
general as a brutal, despicable
killing and charged that the act 
was designed to provoke further 
violence. We condemn this ter
rorism, said State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
Soviet aircraft 
intrudes into 
Japans airspace
TOKYO (AP)  Two Japanese 
Defense Force airplanes 
scrambled after what was believed 
to be a Soviet aircraft that twice 
Friday crossed into Japans north
ern airspace, a Defense Agency 
official said.
The aircraft intruded into Japa
nese airspace at 2:36 am, cross
ing from north to south over 
Rebun, a small island off Japans 
main island of Hokkaido, 500 
miles northwest of Tokyo, the 
official said.
At 3:51 am near the same area, 
what local radar monitoring offi
cials called a large-sized aircraft 
flew from the east toward the 
south, said the official, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity.
The intruding aircraft was in
Japanese airspace for 3-1/2 min
utes, the official said.
Japans airspace begins 12 
nautical miles from shore.
Judging from the flying course 
the aircraft took, we believed it 
might be a Soviet electronics re
connaissance plane, the defense 
official said.
In both cases, two F-15 jet fight
ers were rushed from Chitose Air 
Base on Hokkaido but couldnt 
identify the aircraft because it 
had already left Japanese air
space, the official said. He said a 
Japanese Air Force radar site on 
Hokkaido warned the aircraft 
twice in Russian but received no 
reply.
Japans Foreign Ministry Fri
day lodged a strong protest with 
the Soviet Union over the alleged 
Soviet intrusion, a Foreign Min
istry official said.

NORFOLK, Va. (AP)  Fire 
broke out aboard the battleship 
USS Iowa after an explosion 
Thursday morning, killing 47 
people and injuring an undeter
mined number, officials said.
The extent of damage was not 
known, said Atlantic Fleet spokes
man Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, 
who confirmed the deaths.
The explosion occurred at about
10 am in one of the battleships 
three 16-inch gun turrets as the 
ship was taking part in a gunnery 
exercise about 330 miles north
east of Puerto Rico, said another 
Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Steve 
Burnett.
The training exercise to improve 
fleet readiness began April 13 and 
involved.19,000 people aboard 29 
U.S. ships, three allied ships and 
shore-based aircraft, Baumann 
said. The ships guns were being 
fired to check that they worked
when the explosion occurred, he 
said.
The gun turret was full of 
gunpowder, he said. A gun tur
ret is normally occupied by 27 
people, but can hold up to 60 or 70 
people, Baumann said. There 
were 1,600 people aboard the ship, 
including Vice Adm. Jeremiah 
Johiison, the commander of U.S. 
2nd Fleet.
The aircraft carrier USS Coral 
Sea was about 120 miles west of 
the Iowa and steaming toward it, 
Baumann said.

A tank ruptured as it was un
loaded from an Exxon barge early 
Friday and spilled 300,000 to
400,000 gallons of oily waste into 
the Grand River, state police said.
Environmental officials from
Exxon tell us that the material is 
about 90 percent water, 7 percent 
alcohol and 3 percent oil, said Lt. 
Ronnie Jones of the state police.
No one was injured, Jones said.
Jones said once the sun came 
up the alcohol was expected to 
evaporate, leaving only the oil to 
be cleaned up. In the interim, 
there is a slim chance the mate
rial could catch fire, he said.
The spill happened in a remote 
area about 35 miles southwest of 
Baton Rouge, on the edge of the 
Atchafalaya Basin, a large swamp 
and marsh land that is a breeding 
ground for a variety of water life.
The barge was carrying three 
tanks of the waste, Jones said. 
Workers removed the tanks from 
both ends of the barge, causing it 
to buckle and rupture the middle 
tank, Jones said.
Exxon dispatched a cleanup 
crew from New Orleans. If the 
waste is three percent oil, at
300,000 to 400,000 gallons that 
would amount to 9,000 to 12,000 
gallons of oil.
There was no immediate com 
ment on the spill from Exxon offi

Student government elections to be held today, tomorrow
Mike Ference
I come to this election as the campus candi
date. My involvement in organizations such 
as academic honor societies, varsity sports, 
and intramurals attest to the diversity of my 
experiences. I entered this campaign as a 
representative of the entire campus, a candi
date who is tired of Senate talk and Senate 
inactivity. I am a doer, and this is the focus 
of my agenda:
 Force administration to make University 
Center #1 priority
 Make CMU a 24 hour campus (Libraries, 
Health Center, Entropy, Dining Service)
 Cut bookstore and art store prices
 Hire Minority Student Advisor
 Fight to correct CFA ventilation problem
 Improve Intramural and Athletic pro
grams
CMU students have suffered long enough. 
Things have got to change. Obviously neither 
Student Senate nor one of its Senators have 
or will produce these changes. We need a 
President who represents, not just Senate, 
but the entire campus.
Vote Mike Ference, your campus candidate!
Mark Mittelhauser
There is a tremendous difference between 
knowing the issues and knowing how to 
change them.
We both support important issues; the dif
ference is that I have the experience to be 
effective in addressing them. I have worked 
with students and administrators on initiat' 
ing a comprehensive recycling program, 
extending the hours of the Health Center, 
instituting a 24-hour Escort System, and a 
multitude of other campus concerns. I have 
learned to follow effective paths to solutions, 
but more importantly, I have learned which 
paths not to take.
Currently, CFA students work in cramped, 
unsafe environments; University facilities do 
not accommodate student hours; virtually 
every student on this campus is misunder
stood or marginalized. The Student Govern
ment President has to be more than a repre
sentative of students, he or she must be the 
number one advocate of student concerns.
Not having the experience to do so effectively 
is unacceptable.

Mittelhauser, Ference debate issues and experience in Adamson Wing
The following is an excerpt from 
the student government presiden
tial debate held last Thursday.  
Ed.
Robitshek: What do you feel 
the role of student government 
president is and how do you plan 
on interacting with Student Sen
ate?
Ference: I think I see the stu
dent government president [as] 
the representative of the student 
body.... He is supposed to be the 
one the students feel they can 
approach. He is the one that fights 
for students. I think that the 
student government president 
should attempt to go out into the 
 university to look for problems,
. things that need to be corrected, 
as well as make himself avail
able. And by that I mean more 
than availability through Senate 
office hours....
As I understand it, the student 
government president gets to ad
dress the Board of Trustees. 
Where thats important, acting 
as the representative of the stu
dent body, the same as sitting on 
the Faculty Senate. I think that 
one of the major things that the 
student government president 
has to do is utilize his abilities to 
create external committees. It is 
my intention, if I am elected, to 
expand the external committees 
that exist already.... I plan on 
expanding that to 12 to encom
pass certain aspects of minority 
concerns, Greek issues, issues 
about teaching, things about the 
University Center. I think that 
most importantly, then, also the 
student government president 
has to oversee Senate as they act, 
and to be cautious to keep them 
from making uncared for mistakes 
by use of the presidential veto. I 
think that thats to keep them 
from deviating from their set 
course and that it should be used 
wisely.
Mittelhauser: More than just 
a representative of students, I 
think that the student govern
ment president is the number one 
advocate of students on this 
campus, that the student govern
ment president should go out and 
fight for what the students are 
interested in. But more impor
tantly than that, he should go out 
and communicate and find out, 
first of all, what the students 
want.
In terms of dealing of dealing 
with the Senate, I know every
body on the Senate; I know the 
makeup; I know all of the chairs. 
I know how the Senate works; I 
know the Senate Constitution 
inside and out; I know the fiscal 
Policy....
One of the biggest problems I 
saw this year was the lack of 
communication between the stu
dent government president and 
the Senate. I think that it added 
to a lot of problems that were 
happening on campus. The entire
presidential search committee 
thing was an issue that I think, 
with a little bit more communica
tion, necessarily didnt have to 
come about.
Pierce: Do you favor the pro
posal for a 37 percent cut in the 
Activities Fee paid by Greek 
members, and if it passes on May 
2, would you support an increase 
in the activities fee, or a decrease 
in budgets for organizations which 
have already been set for next 
year?
M: First of all, no, I do not sup
port the proposal. I dont see it as 
a solution. Basically, its taking a 
number that the graduate stu
dents somehow figured out and 
throwing a bunch of money at the 
problem instead of realistically 
addressing it. And another prob
lem that I see with it is that it 
exacerbates the rift right now 
between Greeks and non-Greeks.
I dont necessarily know that in 
all situations I dont support 
money going from the student 
activities fee to an event that 
would be sponsored by Greeks 
and would be open to the entire 
campus community, but only if 
its open to the entire campus 
community. And we should treat 
them like other student organiza
tions and bring the community 
together instead of this proposal, 
which I think separates the cam
pus community.
And as far as the second one 
goes, one of the major problems 
that I have with the cutback is 
that it would be slashing the funds 
of other student organizations. 
And I wholeheartedly disagree 
with this and there is no way that 
Im going to allow seeing these 
budgets cut. So the only alterna
tive would be to have to increase 
the student activities fee by an 
amount for other people because 
I cannot justify cutting the budg
ets of student organizations.
F: I agree with Mark. I dont 
agree with the kickback proposal. 
I feel that there is a problem and 
that is just not the right way to 
address it....
In the past the Greeks have 
approached Senate for special 
funds for events like the Pole Sit 
and to help the barbecue and for 
Mr. Fraternity, and I think that 
perhaps a better idea instead of 
just taking a lump 37 percent. I 
think if they were to come to 
Senate and present their budget 
which would entail the money 
they would need for the fall, lets 
say like sorority rush and charity 
events, things that enhance the 
quality of life, that are available 
to all people on campus, then I 
think thats justifiable. That way 
its not a kickback....
DeYager: Theres basically two
major problems, I guess, facing 
any sort of political action on this 
campus. One is the problem of 
working with or connecting with 
the administration, and the other 
is getting student support for any 
initiative taken by student gov
ernment. What experiences do you 
have to enable you to alleviate 
these problems?
F: I have had experience in ral
lying people together and work
ing with the administration. In 
one of my honor societies, Lambda 
Sigma, I created and conceived a 
new idea to assimilate the group 
members into the organization. It 
was the pledging program,

been through the athletic depart

Pennsylvania state police hit three Pitt frats, cite 104
JONATHAN LEVY
\rtan Contributing Editor
Three University of Pittsburgh 
eternities were raided for underge drinking in the early morning 
fSunday, April 16.
The raids were conducted by 
lie State Police Bureau of Liquor 
;0ntrol Enforcement, the Pitts
burgh Police, and the Pitt Police. 
lCcording to official reports, 109 
leople were cited for underage 
rinking at Phi Kappa Theta (Phi 
[ap), Delta Tau Delta (DTD), and 
;jgma Chi fraternities.
Unlike the November 1987
raids on two Carnegie Mellon fra
ternities, no one was arrested.
The people cited face fines of up 
to $300 and court costs of roughly 
$52.50 if convicted. Under Penn
sylvania law, they would auto
matically lose their drivers li
cences for 90 days.
More than 30 half-barrels of 
beer were confiscated in the raid. 
They will be returned for the de
posit and the money will be given 
to the state.
The authorities reportedly en
tered the three houses and sealed 
off the exits. People with identifi
cation showing that they were
over 21 were allowed to leave and 
those remaining were cited. Erik 
Kridle, the reporter who covered 
the story for The Pitt News, said 
that there were rumors that after 
some people had run upstairs at 
DTD, a police officer pulled the 
fire alarm to get them to come 
down. Rumors say that the par
ents of one student involved in 
the raid may be planning to sue.
Kridle also said that there had 
been rumors throughout the 
weekend that a raid was planned. 
He claimed that Sigma Alpha Ep
silon had cancelled a party on 
Friday night because of the ru
mors and said that one or two 
fraternities may have cancelled 
Saturday parties.
Others reportedly had people 
under 21 sign a list as they en
tered the fraternities. Phi Kap 
was among the fraternities that 
did this, but still suffered the most 
citations with approximately 75. 
Kridle said he did not know the 
intended purpose of the lists, and 
Phi Kap refused to comment on 
the raid. DTD also refused to 
comment and Sigma Chi could 
not be contacted.
Steve Sandrovich, a civilian 
supervisor for the State Bureau
of Liquor Control Enforcement, 
said that he was not aware of any 
information leaks prior to the raid. 
He speculated that the rumors 
could have been started by prank
sters who were trying to harass 
the fraternities, unaware that 
there actually would be raids.
According to Sandrovich, the 
fraternities were targeted because 
of a complaint against them. The 
Bureaus policy is to only raid 
establishments which have been 
mentioned in complaints, San
drovich said. Complaints may be 
anonymous, but the Bureau 
makes a policy of taking infor
mants names in case further 
information is needed to carry 
out the raids successfully. The 
names are kept confidential.
In keeping with usual policy, 
the police will offer to conduct 
followup programs with Pitt to 
help the administration prevent 
future problems.
Sandrovich said that the police 
worked with CMU after the 1987 
raids and now have a good rela
tionship with the administration 
and CMU Police Department. He 
commented that CMUs reaction 
to the raids could be a model for 
other schools.
\sian students discuss stereotypes, feelings, similarities, and differences
JAMES B. ENDRES
'ortan Assistant News Editor
'Come Meet Your Fellow Extic Asian Babes and Wimpy 
isian Dudes, said one of the 
dvertisements for an Asian isues discussion.
Actually, the 120 attendees in 
he packed Adamson Wing met 
nly their own stereotypes about 
,sians last Friday. And in the 
onfrontation, organizers hope 
ome cultural gaps were bridged. 
Hajime Ando, the freshman art 
design major who organized 
he event, said the discussion was 
esigned to open a dialogue about 
tereotypes pinned on Asian stuents and to examine the simiarities and differences within the 
tsian community.
Ando called the event a great 
uccess. Another discussion is 
eing planned, possibly for next 
emester.
I truly thought that this event 
rought many different people 
ogether. The unexpected diver
ity of the people was really surrising and satisfying. I expected
Im trying to work to get this stuff 
into the open. There are a lot of 
Asians who need to be stimulated to 
think about these issues. 
H Hajime Ando
only Asians to come. I figured 
non-Asians just wouldnt be in
terested. The people that pro
voked the most constructive ar
guments were non-Asians. It 
really spiced up the discussion.'
The discussion kicked off with 
an entertaining skit, The Asian 
Dating Game. Ando said the skit 
tried to bring out some typical 
stereotypes for the discussion.
Hiro Higuma, a freshman IM 
major, played the part of the emcee 
in the skit. I think the event 
went very well, Higuma said. 
Personally, I didnt expect so 
many people to show up. I think 
well do an even better job next 
time. Its the first time we actu
ally expressed how we feel. I was
glad to see about ten or fifteen 
Caucasian people there, and also 
a couple of blacks. Im glad they 
could see how we feel. I think it 
was very, very worthwhile. 
Wendy Tsungplayed the bachelorette in the skit. The skit was 
basically to show the differences 
in the bachelors in their back
grounds and upbringing. Bache
lor number one was straight'out 
of Asia, number two had two Asian 
parents but grew up in white 
neighborhoods, and number three 
was very Americanized.
Sungju Kim, a freshman ECE 
major, called the event a pretty 
open discussion. There were some 
pretty sensitive topics that came 
up. People are calling for more
Senior gift to be chosen Thursday
y JENNIFER BANNAN
artan Staffwriter
At 4:30 pm on Thursday, there 
be a senior social at Morrions to decide this years senior 
ift. Senior Gift Committee comlittee member Kevin Joy says 
iat there are a myriad of ideas 
ir the gift. At the Zero Year Renion, to be held the Friday he
re graduation, there will be a 
nal vote cast by seniors to decide 
the gift.
When each class of students 
aduates, its members decide on 
gift to leave to the University, 
enior gifts of the past have been 
ie Clock in front of Doherty Hall, 
ie benches beside the Clock, and
the bar in Scotland Yard.
Ideas for this years senior gift 
include a movie theater in the 
University Center, an outdoor 
pavilion near CFA, outdoor mu
sic equipment, a Centrex phone 
in Panther Hollow Inn, and a 
fountain outside of the Univer
sity Center.
Many of the ideas are contin
gent upon the completion of the 
University Center, since Joy feels 
that the senior class wants to leave 
something for the students more 
than for the University. He thinks 
that a senior gift contingent upon 
completion of. the University 
Center will be helpful in further
ing its development.
It would be nice to see some

understanding between races, 
and we need more interaction 
between different kinds of Asians 
to start with. I learned a lot.
Chuck Leone agreed with 
Higuma and Kim. I was glad 
some non-Asians like myself were 
there. Theres a lot of difficult 
stuff that has to be brought up, or 
else were just evading discus
sion. Leone was enthusiastic 
about attending another discus
sion.
Ando said the next step was to 
begin organizing more such dis
cussions, and to approach Stu
dent Senate for support. I really 
dont know if well be able to hold 
another discussion by the end of 
the year, Ando said, but Id like 
to get together and construct more 
of these. My goal is to get this 
recognized by Senate. The ideas 
still pretty vague, but Id like to 
see this become something like 
the Womens Issues Collective, 
maybe a kind of Asian Issues 
Collective, that is open to every
one but serves Asian needs.
Lina Hoshino, a junior art 
major, is trying to organize an
Asian Studies course. I think the 
discussion was something we 
needed. It was extremely good. I 
think the discussion should con
tinue regularly. Hoshino contin
ued, The Asian Studies course is 
a necessity. Judging from the 
number of people that showed up, 
I think there would be plenty of 
interest in a course.
Ando stressed that he is trying 
to integrate the stuff Im doing 
with what ONE is doing, and what 
Lina is doing to get the course, 
and what ASA and Spirit are 
doing. I dont want it to be an 
isolated thing.
Ando continued, I think ASA 
and KSAhave taken very big steps 
at CMU, but right now I dont 
think theyre aggressively ad
dressing a lot of the issues. So Im 
trying to work with them to get 
this stuff into the open. There are 
a lot of Asians who need to be 
stimulated to think about these 
issues.
Ando explained the provocative 
advertising he designed for the 
event. I did that mainly to catch 
peoples attention; And to pro
voke some sensitive questions, 
maybe to even offend Asians. 
These stereotypes are offensive 
to Asians. We tend to keep hushhush about them, but we need to 
get them into the open.
That was my intention. But a 
lot of non-Asians thought it was a 
clique thing. Next time, Ill make 
sure to target non-Asians too. On 
the other hand, I thought the 
posters were very successful.
After the discussion, CIT Sena
tor and Campus Affairs Chair 
Mark Mittlehauser said, As a 
member of ONE, Im particularly 
happy. Discussions like this were 
the whole reason ONE was 
formed. Its especially good for 
the Asians. Theyre as misunder
stood as any group on campus.
Mittlehauser invited everyone 
at the discussion to the next ONE 
meeting, held Tuesday at 10:00 
pm in the Morewood Reading 
Room.
If anyone is interested in see
ing more discussions like this, 
they can feel free to join ONE. 
Mittlehauser stressed that ONEs 
meetings are open to everyone.
thing for the students, agrees 
senior Barry Drobes, who thinks 
that the best idea is the movie 
theater. He says that when he is 
asked to pledge, he thinks he will, 
especially if they catch him in a 
good mood.
Beth Petrick, another senior, 
thinks that a gift contingent upon 
completion of the University 
Center is a good idea. Im fed up 
with the whole construction of 
this place. The University Center 
is needed. She thinks that the 
movie theater is also the best idea.
Seniors are not asked to give 
money for the gift all at once. Joy 
mentions a five-year plan, in 
which students will be asked to 
give in the years after graduation.
Presidential candidates debate issues, experience
continued from page 3
departments which ignore stu
dent privilege, and if so how 
will you go about it?
F: I think the issue of univer
sity free time has been over
looked. Ive had personal con
flicts with it for athletic teams 
when I have practice during 
university free time.... I know 
next semester, I have a class 
thats going to be from 3:50 to 
4:30, and that overlaps with 
your free time. I think that its 
necessary to put pressure on 
the administration.
But again, its one of those 
things where if there are just 
people writing editorials to The 
Tartan and the Student Union
complaining about it, nothings 
going to be accomplished.
I think its [an] issue where 
students have to get together, if 
its in the form of a Senate sub
committee or in the form of a 
presidential external subcommit
tee, so be it. But its going to have 
finite proposals that can go to the 
administration. Go to Mike 
Murphy, whos the student om
budsman, and say, Listen, this is 
something. You have to help us 
out here because the administra
tion and faculty are not going to 
bend to our will unless we have 
administrative support.
M: ... I think that whenever 
were talkingabout university free 
time what we need to look at is en
tering a little bit of flexibility 
into the system, because Ive 
also had conflicts with athletic 
practices and I understand that. 
But, at the same time, Ive also 
had 7:30 exams and I under
stand that also is a problem. 
So, its a matter of finding a 
happy medium and saying, 
Yeah, we need this free time, 
but at the same time it shouldnt 
be something written in stone. 
We need it and were going to 
strive towards it, but at the 
same time if its just maybe 
twice a semester, having an 
exam at 4:30 as opposed to 7:30, 
I would agree with that.

Designate Murrin moderates GSIA symposium
continued from page 1
tative of the Japanese Ministry of 
Trade and Industry, started the 
discussion by describing how the 
Japanese have increased their 
competitiveness over the past two 
decades.
In Japan, our main concern 20 
years ago was how to improve our 
competitiveness in the world econ
omy. Todays main concern is how 
to deal with the trade surplus, 
explained Kodaira.
He believed that Japans lack of 
natural resources led to a strat
egy focusing on education, long
term investment strategies, and 
highly intensive competition.
The second speaker, John B. 
Yasinsky, Westinghouses execu
tive vice president for world re
sources and technology, empha
sized points where America was 
still strong and where it needed to 
improve. Yasinsky felt that 
American companies had to redi
rect their efforts towards the 
global economy instead of local 
markets.
America is still competitive, 
he emphasized. [But] the gap 
between the U.S. and its competi
tors is closing, and closing rap
idly.
The final speaker, Carnegie 
Mellons International Commit
tee Chair Jean-Jacques ServanSchreiber, addressed competitive
ness from a different perspective,
emphasizing the ties between the 
three regions instead of the dif
ferences.
Servan-Schreiber proposed that 
Europe, America, and Japan all 
needed the markets and resources 
of each other in order to survive 
and grow, and that information 
and education would determine 
the winners and losers in the 
1990s.
The panel was sponsored by the 
GSIA Masters Program.

Task force to consider implementing a student-run honor code
continued from page 1
cerning honor codes comes from a 
study performed at Harvard 
University which examines the 
honor codes of various universi
ties, many of which are similar in 
size to Carnegie Mellon.
Although honor codes differ 
from school to school, most codes 
put the control of the code with
the students.
Supporters claim that there are 
many advantages to an honor 
code. As Steppel states, an honor 
code will effectively reinforce the 
idea of honor throughout the 
community and establish trust.
Dan Resnick, a history profes
sor and chairman of the Educa
tional Affairs Council of Faculty
Senate, feels that schools which 
have an honor code show a growth 
in their pride of work and achieve
ment and have a sense of respon
sibility.
According to Resnick, the cur
rent system of academic regula
tion at CMU, as detailed in the 
Student Handbook, relies on a 
legal basis rather than a moral
one. There is not obligation to 
report cheating right now, al
though students can be penalized 
for cheating if caught, Resnick 
says.
Resnick feels that although an 
honor code may be hard to incor
porate, students would become 
the dominant enforcers, and 
having an honor code would be a
step up for the campus.
Another history professor, Ted 
Fenton, would also like to see an 
honor code established at CMU. 
Fenton is the co-director of the 
University Teaching Center, and 
he points out that it is extremely 
difficult to set up a code at a 
university which has not previ
ously had one. No overnight
miracles will occur ... students, 
should expect the path to be 
stony one.
The selection of the five stuj 
dents who will be on the 
force will take place at the May 2 
meeting of Student Senate at Tpm in the Wherrett Room. All 
interested students should show' 
up or contact Steppel.
Steidel: Engineering applications drop is of a cyclical nature
continued from page 1
think thats one of the reasons 
that business has certainly taken 
off.
; Steidel stressed, however, that 
application levels typically fluc
tuate between various fields. In 
1987, for example, CIT applica
tions rebounded slightly from 
previous declines, rising 6% above 
the 1886 total before falling off 
again in 1988.
Apparently these things do go 
in cycles, said Steidel. Were 
coming to a point again when we 
see a rise in the perceived value of 
a liberal arts/business education.
While such declines typically 
lead to a decline in the quality of 
the class admitted (as students 
are drawn from lower ranks), the 
current SAT scores show no such 
trend. In 1988, the verbal score 
average for CIT applicants was 
586 and the math was 708.
For comparison, the coming 
1989 class totals are 591 verbal, 
and 709 math. Thus, although
We're coming to a point again when 
aRe Pee y rise in the perceived value 
of a liberal arts/business education. 
H Mike Steidel
ing, there is no evidence of a de
cline in quality at least.as far as 
figures such as SAT scores can 
project.
From all indications, the de
cline in technical, particularly 
engineering and computing fields, 
is not unique to CMU. The Uni
versitys situation is analogous to 
that of other colleges in what has 
become a popular shift away from 
technical areas in favor of more 
business-oriented fields.
No doubt about it, this hits us 
hard, said Steidel. But its hit
ting all schools hard; we think 
that were certainly holding our 
own here. What we get in terms of 
other places that have engineer- everybodys experiencing this. 
MIT, one of CMUs top two 
competitors, is also seeing declin
ing interest in engineering and 
computer science fields. Those two 
areas comprise the largest depart
ment at MIT, where the overall 
number of applications has 
dropped 10% from 1988s total. 
There is a lower percentage of 
students who are planning to 
major in electrical engineering
and computer science, said MIT 
admissions department staff 
member Bette Johnson, so the 
number has decreased.
Because of the overwhelming 
number of applications compared 
with the number of students 
admitted, Johnson said that the 
current decline hasnt had as 
pronounced an effect at MIT.
Nevertheless, the university 
has begun to take steps to deal 
with the situation. Recently the 
school has begun to accept trans
fer students into the electrical 
engineering and computer science 
programs, in contrast to past 
policy. In the past we would not 
accept transfers into the electri
cal engineering and computer 
science department because that
department was so large, said 
Johnson, but that policy has been 
changed.
In an effort to deal with the 
situation at CMU, the admissions 
department has begun a collabo
rative effort with the faculty in 
affected areas. For example, Stei
del said that measures have been 
taken to make the engineering 
department heads more available 
for consultation with prospective 
students.
As Steidel sees it, one of the 
primary tasks of the Admissions 
Office lies in dealing with such 
trends. Part of our job is really to 
convey this type of information, 
these kinds of trends to the de
partments. So far theyve been 
very cooperative with us.
As for the future, no definite 
course of action has as yet been 
slated. Were ready, if we have 
to, to make serious adjustments,! 
said Steidel, but at this point we 
really havent had to. For the 
meantime, he added, the affected 
departments are continuing to 
watch the situation closely.
Both Steidel and Johnson both 
feel that the current trend, al
though worthy of notice, is nol 
permanent. Johnson said thai 
such trends in the academic world 
tend to be of a cyclic nature,1 
rising and falling from year to 
year.
Steidel agreed. The pendulum 
swings back and forth, and right 
now were on a different side of 
the swing.

Ference around midnight.
Ference and Mittelhauser par
ticipated in a formal public de
bate Thursday in the Adamson 
Wing. About 50 people turned out 
to watch them field questions from 
a student panel and then from the 
audience.
Members of the panel were 
Kevin DeYager, a Student Union 
non-editor; Andy Robitshek, cur
rent Student Government Presi
dent; Howdy Pierce, news editor 
for The Tartan; and Frank Boscoe, 
general manager of WRCT.
The two remaining candidates 
both oppose the proposed 37%
kickback of Greek activities fees. 
Ference is a brother at Theta Xi. 
Mittelhauser was once a member 
of Beta Theta Pi, but depledged.
In his opening remarks, Fer
ence presented the University 
Center and a 24-hour campus 
as two important planks in his 
platform. Mittelhauser opened by 
stressing his experience, campus 
sensitivity diversity, and night
time safety as his campaign is
sues.
The candidates went on to dis
cuss their ideas about how to deal 
with the administration, Student 
Senate, the proposed 37%> Greek 
activity fee kickback, and the 
University Center, to name a few.
Excerpted remarks from the

Greek kickback to get 
special ballot next week
continued from page 1
without side effects. As reported 
in The Tartan last week, the Greek 
plan will almost certainly re
sult in a hike in the activities fee 
if passed, according to Associate 
Dean of Student Affairs Lois Cox.
By forcing the kickback issue 
on the ballot, the Greeks may 
have called for a showdown be
tween Greeks and non-Greeks at 
the polls.
Were just giving the informa
tion to the house presidents and 
having them try to motivate their 
houses, said Antonson. We hope 
that Greeks will come out in a 
block and vote for it. Currently, 
there are about 1300 students
affiliated with Greek houses.
On the other side of the issue, 
two senators  Seth Kaufman 
and Jill Moore  are lobbying 
against the Greek proposal. Al
though they stress that they are 
acting merely as students and not 
as senators, they called for meet
ings of all funded and non-funded 
organizations Sunday night to get 
students out to vote against the 
referendum.
I think its really important 
that non-funded organizations  
and funded organizations, too, for 
that matter  realize what they 
have at stake here, said Moore. 
We hope people really just go out 
and spread the word.

James Stepanek, CIT
The University shows a remarkable lack of 
concern for the opinions of the student body. 
Many organizations are overlooked in spite 
of legitimate claims. I believe I understand 
many of the wrongdoings and could do a 
good deal towards correcting especially 
grievous wrongs.

There are many problems facing Carnegie 
Mellon, ranging from the Greek kickback 
to the University Center. Throughout the 
past year I have used my position as a 
senator to find the best and most fair 
solution to these problems. If re-elected I 
will continue to do so.
Guy Spivack, CIT
My goal as senator is to represent CIT, 
not myself. I will also push towards 
improving the campus recreational 
facilities.
Brad Wyatt, CIT
Are you sick of the way things are being 
run? Lets push for a 24-hour campus and 
more concern by the University towards 
the needs of its students. Vote for a 
change.
Kirk Lenga, H&SS
Too many Student Senators are members 
because they think it looks good on their 
resume. Its time, to elect someone who will 
work for improving the quality of student 
life.

James Atwater, CIT
In the year I have been at CMU, I have noticed 
problems that need attention. The University 
Center, a minority advisor, and continuing 
improvement of Food Services should be high 
priorities of the Administration. As a senator, I 
would push for solutions to these and other 
problems.
Pete Gaertner, MCS
The 37% kickback for Greeks may not be a 
solution but it represents a problem. Many 
students feel they are not getting their 
moneys worth. As senator I will work to 
improve how your money is spent. Other 
issues include the University Center, and a 
24-hour campus.

I vow never to use the phrase working to

student issues.
Chris Neighbor, CFA
There are many problems at CMU but none 
so plentiful as the ones coming out of CFA. 
As a CFA senator I will work with the new 
dean to help bridge the gaps between the 
departments. I plan on introducing and 
setting up a CFA SAC.
Roy Conard, CFA
Quality of life at CMU means improved 
academic, social, and leisure activities. 
Any interests of the students must be 
encouraged since this is the time and 
place to grow, explore, and experiment. 
As a Student Senator, I have and will 
continue to support students interests.

'he Student Senate can and should continue 
to improve the quality of life on campus. By 
focusing on such issues as the University 
Center and 24-hour campus services, we 
can make Carnegie Mellon a better place to 
learn and play. I will work toward these
goals.
David P. Radzanowski, SUPA
The number one issue facing CMU is that of multi
cultural awareness. I support instituting a required 
multi-cultural awareness class for all firstyearstudents. 
A second issue of importance is that of furthering 
CMUs relationship with the surrounding Pittsburgh 
community.

Experience will make the best 
student government president
In recent weeks, we have been 
inundated with posters advocat
ing this or that candidate for stu
dent political office in the campus 
elections being held today and 
tomorrow in front of Doherty Hall.
As one might expect, it is the 
posters for student government 
president which have been most 
prominent. Since two candidates 
dropped out of the race last 
Wednesday night, the student 
body is left to choose between 
sophomores Mark Mittelhauser 
and Mike Ference to lead it 
through the next academic year.
The candidates posters tell the 
whole story.
Ferences posters inform us of 
The Ference Agenda, an eightpoint platform which includes 
such ideas as making Dr. Cyert 
more available to the campus and 
getting a better film projector 
and speakers in DH 2210.
If elected, this would be Fer
ences first position ever in stu
dent government. His posters 
betray his inexperience: How can 
any student government president 
force the very busy and already 
fairly accessible Cyert to be more 
available? And isnt the film 
projection equipment in Doherty 
2210 the realm of AB and SDC, 
not the student government presi
dent?
Ference has good ideas, but he 
doesnt have the familiarity with 
how Carnegie Mellon operates to 
know what is feasible or how to go 
about accomplishing his goals.
In contrast, Mittelhausers 
posters bear a single word: Expe
rience. As a Student Senator and 
the head of Senates Campus Af
fairs Committee, Mittelhauser has 
been out working on many of the 
issues for which Ference claims 
he has the solutions.
Mittelhauser has already pro
vided the initiative for a campuswide recycling project; he has 
already worked with Dining Serv
ice to extend the service hours of 
MorePizza and the Tartan Grill; 
and he has already pushed the ad
ministration to extend the routes 
and hours of the shuttle/escort 
service.
In short, Mittelhauser knows 
his way around the local power 
structure. He, too, has good ideas, 
and unlike Ference, he has the 
experience to effectively imple
ment them. That experience, we 
feel, will pay direct dividends to 
the student body in the form of a 
president who can get more things 
done.
We at The Tartan wholeheart
edly support Mark Mittelhauser 
for student government president. 
The posters tell the whole story.
A Tartan editor-in-chief resigns
Karl Barnhart, editor-in-chief 
of The Tartan since January of 
1988, resigned last week. We 
regret the loss of such an impor
tant and valued member of the 
papers staff, although we hope 
the thoughts provoked by this un
fortunate development will spark 
some positive changes.
Last week, a group of editors 
presented a letter to Karl express
ing what they felt were pressing 
problems with the management 
of the organization. Upon discus
sion, it became clear that the 
problems were rooted in deeper 
philosophical differences.
We all hoped to resolve our 
conflicts and come out of the expe
rience stronger and more unified. 
Unfortunately, those differences 
proved to be insurmountable. We 
respect Karl for holding true to 
his beliefs; nonetheless, we regret
that we were unable to find an 
alternate solution.
As a collegiate journalist, Karl 
is one of the best. His thorough
ness, drive, and writing ability 
make him an asset to any newspa
per. We sincerely hope that he 
will again participate in The Tar
tan, as his involvement can cer
tainly be considered a benefit.
Managing Editor Dustin Fra
zier will serve as acting editor-inchief until the semesters end. At 
that time, a new editor-in-chief 
will be selected by the editorial 
board.
Karl was our editor, but more 
importantly, he is our friend. We 
are indebted to him for encourag
ing a new tradition of profession
alism and quality, and we remain 
committed to expanding and 
improvingThe Tartan in the spirit 
of that tradition.

Sexist to some...
Compubookie predictions didn't amuse everyone
Editor:
After reading the Compubookie article 
from Carnival, I was furious. Not neces
sarily because of any of the malicious or 
overly sarcastic comments written about 
every buggy organization, but because of 
one in particular. The comment directed 
to SDC was: A woman Buggy Chair
man, need I say more! I know that this 
traditional article is always rude. I know 
that it is supposedly harmless criticism. 
I know that it is not supposed to bother 
me. But, that particular comment was 
more than rude humor; it was a very 
blatant sexist comment and proof of the 
prejudices on campus. Not only was it an 
insult to the SDC buggy chairman and 
all the women participating in buggy, 
but it was an insult to every woman. If I 
am interpreting correctly, and I defi
nitely think I am, this person predicts 
the outcome of SDC buggy negatively 
because their chairman is a woman. How 
openly prejudiced can one get? Am I 
going to read The Tartan next week and 
read about another persons insensitive 
and prejudiced opinion? How can The 
Tartan print something like that?
Unless The Tartan condones that opin
ion, thinks that it is O.K. to print, ac
cepted even, it should not have been 
printed. For Compubookie to have his 
own prejudiced opinion is fine. Everyone 
is entitled to their own opinion. For The 
Tartan to print that very prejudiced 
opinion is unreprehensible! The Tartan, 
at least, should be sensitive to the differ2aR1aebP tr tke ?datrb
ent people reading the paper.
This is just one example of the insensi
tivity on campus that is just recently 
being brought into the open. This idea, or 
attitude of superiority over others is what 
makes this campus insensitive. It may 
be unconscious, but it is definitely there. 
If this campus tried to rid itself of these 
prejudices and strive to become more 
unified, then The Tartan should be lead
ing that movement. Editors should edit 
prejudiced opinions. Everyone should 
become aware of what they are saying 
and thinking; is it filled with.unfair 
prejudices?

Carnival competition 
stirs up prejudices
Editor:
It is common knowledge that during 
Buggy season, the behavior of many Car
nival participants crosses over the line of 
respectability. Competition stirs up 
prejudices that (more or less) remain 
hidden throughout the remainder of the 
year. I am not writing to sti.^a this obvi
ous fact, but question the judgement (not 
of any of the participants), but of the
Womens Buggy coverage lacking
Editor:
I was extremely disappointed in The 
Tartans coverage of Carnival events in
last weeks issue, namely Buggy. It seems 
that the men who competed in Sweep
stakes were given much more coverage, 
both with pictures and quotes, than the 
women. The womens Buggy races are 
fast becoming just as exciting as the 
mens, and I can see no reason why The 
Tartan would so unfairly regard this 
fact. I was under the evidently mistaken 
impression that women on this campus 
were treated as equals, even when it 
comes to recreational events such as 
Carnival. Perhaps less space could have 
been devoted to the article misleadingly 
entitled Spirit teams take victories in 
Mens, Womens Buggy races, which in
reality said the absolute minimum about 
the winners as possible, and instead read 
like some long-winded dissertation on 
What happens at Buggy. Gee, you would 
really have to be braindead to be a stu
dent here and not know what goes on at 
Sweepstakes, even if you had never at
tended the races, dont you think? This 
insults the intelligence of the students 
by telling them what they are already 
aware if. I personally know that all the 
women that participated in the Buggy 
races trained as hard as the men did for 
this event, and competed equally as well. 
We definitely deserve more recognition 
and respect than your paper gave us.

editor(s) of the Compubookie article. It 
was quite surprising to read the bla
tantly sexist remark against the SDC 
Buggy Chairwoman. The short article 
(preceding this years Compubookie ar
ticle) explaining its origin and offensive 
overtone does not divorce the editor(s) 
responsibility of removing material that 
produces nothing but rage and anger in 
every person that has done their best to 
remove prejudice and sexism from the 
buggy course (and ultimately, the CMU t 
campus).
Printing articles of this nature is an, 
invitation for other asinine comments., 
from bigoted, spineless individuals who", 
do not have enough guts to take respon
sibility for their worthless opinions. The 
Tartans printing of the Compubookie 
article without properly editing out bigoted and sexist material has hindered,, 
attempts to end the unforgivable treat
ment of all individuals who experience;, 
prejudice on this campus. How can the 
problem be solved when the source is so 
carefully hidden from those on the re
ceiving end? The Tartan provided an n 
outlet for the sexist and bigoted opin-, 
ions. The most depressing thought is,, 
that a supposedly respectable institu-. 
tion whose job is to preserve human rights 
through the freedom of the press hax> 
contributed to the enormous problem of 
bigotry and sexism that ultimately destroys them.
If the editor(s) thought the comment 
about the SDC buggy chairwoman was... 
relatively harmless and quite humorous 
in nature, then maybe he/she should 
consider taking some time off from edit; 
ing and take a closer look at the damage 
this kind of behavior actually does. One 
writer for The Tartan explained to me, 
that there are certain lines that the edi-. 
tors are certain not to cross. Well, maybe, 
its time to redraw a few of those lines. .

Search committee nomination a non-issue
Editor:
I feel that The Tartan has 
done a great disservice to 
the community by writing 
an article about a non-issue.
Last week The Tartan ran a

Pets in dorms and the letter of the law...
Better hide that hamster: HousingsAlibis to iive by: Good 
excuses for not votingSeveral weeks ago 60 Coarse 
received a letter in response to a 
column in which it was stated 
that the official holiday of mid
semester break was only the Mon
day after the weekend, and that 
teachers were perfectly justified 
in giving work over that week
end. Of course according to the 
letter of the rules the author of the 
letter was correct, but almost any 
student here at CMU would argiie the fairness of the point. Fol
lowing that reasoning, the week
ends before and after spring break 
are work days. Come on, no one 
really believes that.
The problem in this case is not 
so much the rules, but their inter
pretation  obviously the spirit 
of a spring break is to give stu
dents some time off to escape CMU 
stress. When theres work as
signed over that break there is no 
escape, only a heightening of 
stress due to the guilt a student 
feels for putting off the assigned 
work.
Following the rules to the letter
This whole kickback idea is 
starting to intrigue me.
The argument is if people dont 
participate in the activities that 
the activities fee pays for, they 
shouldnt have to pay as much as 
people who do. If you think about 
it, its sort of like paying for your 
best friend to date the girl youve 
been dying to ask out the past 
couple of weeks.
Think how much time your 
average architect has to partici
pate in any campus activities. 
Worse yet, these people pay the 
activities fee for five years. If they 
had time to read The Tartan and 
know about the election, theyd 
be petitioning for a 100% kickback.
However, Im one of those people 
who does participate in a lot of 
things. In fact, it takes about half
The Supreme Court is sched
uled to hear arguments tomorrow 
concerning the Missouri case. This 
case has the potential to overturn 
Roe vs. Wade, the infamous deci
sion that legalized abortion-ondemand. Before I make my pre
diction about the verdict, I want 
to appeal to the people who are 
still uncertain about this issue. 
The abortion issue is not the 
first of its kind to be fiercely de
bated. If people looked at it from 
a historical perspective, they 
tvould easily find an instance in 
American history that is almost 
identical to the one we now face. 
Slavery and abortion provide a 
striking example of history re
peating itself. The more I study 
the abortion and slavery issues, 
the more I am amazed to see the 
legal, moral, economical, and so
cial similarities.
Both abortion and slavery were 
legalized by a tragic 7-2 Supreme 
Court decision. In 1857 the Su
preme Court ruled in Dred Scott 
that, despite the obvious evidence 
o the contrary, a Black is not a 
>erson. He does not become a 
lerson until he is set free, and, 
herefore, he does not have any 
egal rights. Slave owners refused 
to acknowledge the fact that 
Blacks were entitled to the same 
egal protection that other people 
eceived.
In 1973 the Court ruled in Roe 
hat a fetus is not a person until 
le is born, despite the obvious 
vidence to the contrary. Thereore he does not have any legal 
Jghts. The slave was the prop!rty of the owner, to do with what 
le pleased. Today, the fetus is 
property of the mother, to do 
j'ith what she pleases. Pro-aboronists refuse to acknowledge the 
act that unborn babies are entled to the same legal protection 
^t other people receive.
If the legal aspects arent ap>arent, perhaps the moral argu
ments will be. Abolitionists were 
ld that they should not impose 
heir morality on slave owners. 
Nobody was forcing people to own 
laves. If you disagree with slav? NrybPe 
falkyeG ON Obrut
but not the spirit is a problem 
everywhere in our society, but is 
especially evident here at CMU. 
Instead of being reasonable we 
resort to the written legal codes. 
Of course it is difficult to rely 
entirely on common sense (espe
cially since many of the people in 
petty positions of authority seem 
to have none) but it is still a goal 
that we should strive for.
The preceding discussion about 
assignments given over breaks is 
a good example. Professors at 
CMU should be educated enough 
to know that the increased pro
ductivity that would result from 
well-rested and un-stressed stu
dents would more than offset the 
work lost by not giving assign
ments over holidays. If they can
not follow the spirit of holidays 
(and its not like were drowning 
in days off) then there is really

Steo 2eRane
of Kappa Sigmas activities fee 
money to pay for the things Ive 
done (thanks guys!). One of these 
days, theyre going to ask for their 
money back and I havent got it.
Actually the idea of making the 
activities fee pay as you go has 
some attraction. If you feel that 
AB Dances get too much money, 
you can prove it by forcing them 
to get $5 from every one who goes 
to them and see how long they 
last.
This system could lead to some 
problems, though. For example, 
what happens if everyone who 
wants to read The Tartan has to
Bezz wybtbr
ery then dont own a slave, but 
dont force your anti-slavery views 
on others. People should have the 
right to choose whether or not 
they want to own slaves.
Now pro-abortionists tell the 
anti-abortionists not to impose 
their morality on the mother. If a 
woman does not want to have an 
abortion, then that is fine. But 
other people should not force their 
anti-abortion views on her. 
Women should have the right to 
choose whether or not they want 
to have an abortion. Instead of 
promoting discrimination against 
people based on skin color, pro
abortionists promote discrimina
tion based on agethose under 
nine months old being the ones 
that are discriminated against.
Even the economic and social 
arguments are the same. Pro
slavery people told the abolition
ists that the economic and social 
costs of prohibiting slavery would 
be astronomic. What would the 
slave owners who want to keep 
their slaves do? How will they 
manage if they cannot own slaves? 
Besides, its more compassionate 
to let people be slaves rather than 
set them free because theyll be 
neglected and abused as free 
persons. And the financial bur
den will be unfairly distributed 
on one class: slave owners.
Now the pro-abortionists tell 
anti-abortionists that the social 
and economic costs of prohibiting 
abortion will be astronomic. What 
will the pregnant mother who 
doesnt want to have her child do? 
How will she manage if her right 
to have an abortion is taken away? 
Besides, its more compassionate 
to never let an unwanted baby be 
born because it will only be ne
glected and abused as a child. 
And the financial costs will be 
unfairly distributed on one class: 
pregnant mothers.
Abortion, like slavery, is a hor
rible injustice. What can those of 
us who realize this inhumanity 
do? We can continue showing
something wronghere. Read this 
on the beach in Florida or take 
a break from Carnival to read 
this is not something that stu
dents should have to put up with.
Another example of unneces
sarily following rules to the letter 
is the famous no pets rule in 
dormitory housing. Now it seems 
obvious to me that this rule is in 
place for several reasons  to 
give housing legal recourse if a 
students pet is noisy, unsanitary, 
or irritating to other students in 
the dorm and to prevent the inhu
mane treatment of animals 
(cramping a dog up in a dorm 
room is just simply cruelty to 
animals). However, when the 
animal in question is a well kept, 
clean and quiet hamster, guinea 
pig, mouse, kitten, rabbit, or 
snake, and no other students in 
the dorm complain, why enforce 
the rule? The animal is obviously 
not hurting any one and may even 
be helping to reduce stress in its 
owners. Yet housing, which for 
two years seemed incapable of
pay five cents each week. What 
would you have to pay to read the 
Student Union?
Quickly the system would break 
down, after all I wouldnt insert a 
dime in my radio every time I 
turn on WRCT. They make us pay 
the activities fee at the start of 
the semester with tuition, which 
means my loans take care of it. 
Give me those 80 bucks at the 
start of the semester and in two 
weeks Ill have spent it all on 
CDs.
There has to be a better way, 
and there is: annoyance fees.
Figure out how much it would 
annoy the average student be
cause he has nothing to do. A 
person perfectly content to do his 
work and not join any clubs would 
get refunds. People like me who 
get bored real easy would spend
people the civil injustice that 
abortion perpetrates on society, 
while the pro-abortionists con
tinue to deny it.
And my prediction? In the near 
future, starting with the Supreme 
Courts overturn of Roe, history

rigorously disciplines any stu
dents caught with a pet. This is 
a good example of following the 
letter of rules when the energy 
could best be spent elsewhere.
60 Coarse suggests that a major 
effort at following the spirit of the 
rules instead of adhering blindly 
to their letter be made by the fac
ulty, housing office, and student 
government. Keeping in mind the 
reasons behind rules encourages 
their correct implementation and 
avoids the waste of valuable or
ganizational resources. In the 
macrocosm of society we waste 
billions of dollars on lawyers to 
interpret rules to the letter. Let

Affirmative action is better for society
Editor:
Jonathan Levy states in his 
April 18 column that he is hon
estly sympathetic to affirmative 
action, then asks but what is to 
be gained by taking a job away 
from a 20-year-old? I must re
spond to the outrageous distor
tion perpetuated by this question. 
In the first place, jobs are not 
being taken away from white 
males of any age to be given to 
women and/or nonwhites. People 
raised in overprivileged homes 
may think that there is a desir
able job waiting for every student 
whose achievement is up to ex
pectations. But people whose lives 
have been affected by unemploy. ment, who have looked beyond 
the troubles unemployment 
brought to them personally, have 
realized that this socioeconomic 
system does not offer a decent job
2ettebP tr tke ?datrb6666666
to everyone who wants one and 
qualifies for one. The meaning of 
the employment rate, apart from 
fictional unemployment (a term 
not often used recently), is that 
some qualified people are left out.
Jonathan Levy may still ask, 
why me? if he faces the fact. His 
self-centered assumption is that 
affirmative action was set up to 
punish white males for the ra
cism and sexism of earlier gen
erations of white males. He is 
only looking at the effect of af
firmative action on himself as an 
individual. Its not possible to be 
honestly sympathetic to affirma
tive action while looking at this 
social program from a strictly 
individual point of view. The jus
tification for affirmative action is
its benefit to society, not its direct 
benefits to the female and non
white individuals who are quali
fied for jobs but who would usu
ally lose out to super-credentialed white males without affirma
tive action. Is it important to 
society that every opening for a 
biology major be filled by the biol
ogy major with the best grades 
from the best school? Its evident 
to me that bringing gender and 
ethnic/racial diversity into com
panies is of greater benefit to 
society. The perspectives brought 
to the companies by those who 
were outsiders before affirma
tive action will, in time, change 
those companies hiring practices 
so affirmative action is no longer 
needed. Minority perspectives can 
be expected to change companies 
in other ways beneficial to soci
ety, too. I want to see women and
nonwhites in managementnot 
so much to compensate those 
individuals as to make manage
ment more likely to take into 
account the effects of the compa
nies practices on classes of people 
never encountered by economi
cally secure white males. As 
honestly sympathetic as Jonathan 
Levy may intend to be, he cant be 
expected to represent minority 
concerns within a company with 
the same background knowledge 
as a member of a minority group. 
Given that there aren't enough 
good jobs for every qualified ap
plicant, its better for society if 
more minority applicants get the 
good ones, even if Jonathan Levy 
ends up working at McDonalds 
this summer.

Fighting racism with a positive force: Affirmative action
The following is an open letter to 
Jonathan Levy. - Ed.
Mr. Levy:
In your column [The race for 
equality is leading to more ra
cism, 4/18], you ask your readers 
to respond to two questions, the 
answers to which are designed to 
show the injustice of affirmative 
action. I wish to make responses 
to these questions, and to ask a 
few of my own in a general re
sponse to your attack on affirma
tive action programs.
First, your questions: no, I do 
not believe that it is right to deny 
a person equal opportunity on the 
basis of race - in an ideal world', 
and, yes, the specific race in ques
tion does matter, because we do 
not Jive in an ideal world. I will 
not deny that affirmative action 
involves a kind of discrimination; 
anyone who says otherwise is dis
torting language. Beyond this, 
however, I will concede nothing 
further - despite appearances, I 
have not conceded everything. 
Given a history of centuries of 
discrimination (and much worse) 
against blacks in America, which 
has left them in a disadvantaged 
position, affirmative action is a 
justified measure. It most cer
tainly does matter which race the 
society chooses to aid in the form 
of affirmative action programs 
(and, as a result, who must pay 
the price). White males have 
never, in the history of America, 
been systematically victimized by 
prejudice. Blacks have suffered 
the evils of prejudice, and they 
continue to suffer from that sad
It is more likely that affirmative ac
tion will help remove racism, by show
ing potentially racist people that 
blacks can be competent in jobs tra
ditionally held by whites'
legacy. Our society has a respon
sibility to even the balance, and 
such an extreme imbalance re
quires extreme solutions.
I wish to challenge your claim 
that you know the argument for 
affirmative action, Mr. Levy. You 
state that affirmative action is 
intended to compensate minori
ties for the racism that was prac
ticed against them for most of this 
countrys history. Although this 
statement indicates that you rec
ognize the historical background, 
it also illustrates a fundamental
The centuries of discrimination 
have left blacks in socially and 
economically deprived positions 
relative to white Americans - in 
1989. Affirmative action is in
tended to correct this inequality, 
as quickly and painlessly as pos
sible.
If we were to successfully elimi
nate racism from our society, 
blacks should eventually achieve 
proportionate numbers in the po
sitions of privilege, wealth, and 
status in America. But how long 
would it take? As long as the three
failure to understand the purpose hundred years of discrimination?
of affirmative action. As you 
rightly point out, this retroactive 
argument is very weak. We can
not hold white Americans respon
sible for the sins of their ances
tors, even slaveowning ancestors. 
Nor can we compensate victims 
who are no longer alive (leaving 
aside a problem you seem to ig
nore, that many black Americans 
continue to endure the penalties 
of racism - witness the growth of 
hate organizations). Affirmative 
action, however, does not rest on 
this defective retroactive argu
ment. Affirmative action is 
fundamentally forward looking.
HERBLOCK S CARTOON
h?w2?NL!.WS OF A g:2!N Lxg8?h
Furthermore, can we realistically 
expect to expel racist stereotypes 
from our shores while blacks 
continue to hold so many unde
sirable occupations, and while 
blacks continue to represent such 
a large fraction of our nations 
poor? Affirmative action proposes 
to remove racist stereotypes by 
placing blacks in positions in 
which they can demonstrate their 
competence, and to help bring 
blacks out of the underclass, both 
directly through allotment of jobs, 
and indirectly through the estab
lishment of new role models for 
younger blacks.
I object also to the misleading 
title of your column, which asks 
Is affirmative action working[?] 
In fact, your column never in
quires whether affirmative action 
works, but questions its justifica
tion. We indeed should ask if af
firmative action is working, if it is 
achieving its goals. I recognize
that affirmative action requires 
discrimination (but not racism, 
which involves a system of beliefs 
about race); I regard this as a 
necessary evil, a consequence of 
our flawed society. It can only be 
justified if it is producing sub
stantial positive effects. Many 
opponents of affirmative action 
argue that it simply encourages 
further racism against blacks by 
arousing resentment among those 
who believe themselves injured 
by affirmative action programs, 
like you. If your reaction is any 
indication, however, I should be 
encouraged, because you show no 
signs of racism, despite your dis
appointment. More to the point, I 
regard it as more likely that af
firmative action will help remove 
racism, by showing potentially 
racist people that blacks can be 
competent in jobs traditionally 
held by whites (assuming that af
firmative action programs require 
at least a minimum level of com
petence - high school dropouts 
will not be hired as brain sur
geons). I make no claim to have 
the expertise to answer the very 
important empirical questions 
about the effectiveness of affirma
tive action programs: do they 
reduce racism, and do they help 
alleviate long-standing social and 
economic inequalities? Given the 
newness of most of these pro
grams, the answers to these ques
tions may not be apparent for 
many years. Nevertheless, Amer
ica requires a dramatic solution 
to the problems remaining after 
three centuries of slavery and 
discrimination, and affirmative

members of Scotch n Soda
Editor:
As members of the board of 
Scotch n Soda, we would like to 
clarify a few issues which were 
addressed last week in The Tar
tan. We do not wish to burden the 
student body with further public 
accusations, therefore a dialogue 
is currently being carried out with 
the involved parties regarding 
specific issues.
We would like to explain, how
ever, how Scotch n Sodas deci
sion process operates. Scotch n 
Sodas board consists of nine 
elected positions each with equal 
voting power. Decisions and poli
cies made by Scotch n Soda are 
the democratic result of the often 
differing opinions of board memresearch  DoD  SEI "GALA  Star Wars  Spring Carnival  sleep  research

We welcome the response and

Senior gift a final way of 
saying Thanks, CMU
To Seniors and students:
I am a senior information 
systems major who has partici
pated in everything from var
sity sports and commissioning 
intramural sports, to announc
ing for WRCT, to serving as a 
student senator. I am a mem
ber of Theta Xi Fraternity and 
am chairman of the Academic 
Computing Student Advisory 
Council. I have participated in 
a variety of clubs and activities 
and have lived the college life 
to its fullest (Pat Carey). But 
the main reason I, and many 
other people, chose Carnegie 
Mellon (regardless of its extraor
dinary high tuition) was be
cause of the national reputa
tion CMU holds. Simply put, I 
came here to get a job. I wanted 
a well-paying job without hav
ing to go to graduate school in 
order to specialize in a field. 
Carnegie Mellon promoted it
self as the professional choice, 
and that is all I wanted. Well, 
now I am graduating and I have 
gotten my job AND a lot of coldoes not care about the stu
dents, and that there are so 
many things wrong with the 
campus. This is also untrue. I 
have been on many committees 
involving the administration, 
and they do care. The problem 
is that many students just dont 
see their point of view and are 
too apathetic to find out what is 
going on. Industrial manage
ment majors, for one, should 
know how hard it is to coordi
nate 20 or more different de
partments. In any case, they do 
try.
I spoke with some friends over 
break about their schools and I 
saw that they had problems as 
well (sometimes even worse 
than who is on the Presidential 
Search Committee). I found one  
difference between our school 
and other schools; CMU handles 
our problems more effectively 
through open communication. 
As much of a useless circus as 
the Student Senate seems, 
behind all the bickering, they 
get far more done on this camGive money to the senior gift. 
Let our class be remembered as 
a class who was proud of what 
Carnegie Mellon offered. 
lege memories as well.
When I was talking to other 
seniors about what to give 
Carnegie Mellon for the tradi
tional senior gift, I got many 
negative responses like I hate 
this place, its too much work 
and not enough fun and after 
all they charged me, Ill never 
give this school a cent. I ex
pected bad attitudes, but I also 
expected those attitudes to 
become college nostalgia as we 
graduated. The negative criti
cisms are disheartening when 
you take into account that many 
of the people who attended 
Carnegie Mellon received ex
actly what they wanted from 
college; in most cases, a first job 
or a good graduate school.
Every single one of you chose 
to come to Carnegie Mellon. If 
you got accepted to CMU, you 
were undoubtedly accepted into 
other schools. In accepting your 
offer, you knew you would be 
paying a lot of money for school. 
So money is not a valid excuse 
to hate CMU. If you hated CMU 
because the education was not 
good enough for you, you should 
have transferred. If the credits 
dont transfer it seems like it 
would certainly be worth an 
extra year or two in college to 
get a good education. Some 
people told me that they got a 
job because they worked so hard, 
not because of Carnegie Mellons reputation. That is bolo
gna! The two go hand in hand. 
Big companies and graduate 
schools recruit at CMU because 
they expect that the students 
have worked hard and have 
been educated well. Many stu
dents think the administration
pus than other student senates 
seem to get done. Many stu
dents on this campus see prob- 
lems and just complain. If you  
want something done, you have U1 
to get involved to get it changed. ~ 
If you do not have the time, well 
then as far as I am concerned < 
you do not have time to com
plain about the problems either. 
Things have changed a lot in 
my four years, and many things 
will change in the future with 
your help.
Everyone at this school came 
to Carnegie Mellon because they "j 
chose to. You had opportunities n 
to participate in any club or  
activity you wanted to and get.: 
your moneys worth, or you;; 
could have done nothing except L 
eat, sleep, and do homework. 
The good times were there, it 
was your choice. The education  
is considered top notch and very  
competitive in many journals.:: 
This school gave us everything ; 
it stood for in our years here: a ,H 
good education, a good job or.. 
graduate school, and good times.  
All I am asking is that you - 
participate in the decision (at  
the zero year reunion sponsored  
by Alumni Relations) and give;0 
money, when asked next year,  
to the traditional senior gift., 
Let our class be remembered as n 
a class who was proud of what  
Carnegie Mellon offered. One 
last thing, fellow classmates: - 
Do not be so hard on our school,: 
because it will be your alma ! 
mater forever and it deserves a , 
token of thanks.

Mens and womens track take fifth at UAA championships

Carnegie Mellons tennis teams 
had a relatively good outing at 
the University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) Championship tour
nament at Emory University last 
weekend. Both the mens and 
womens teams performed as well 
as expected, considering they 
faced some of the best Division III 
teams in the country.
Eight schools - with over 150 
players, coaches, and trainers - 
descended on Atlanta for the 
three-day tournament which 
began lastSaturday morning and 
continued through last night, 
when the championships matches 
were played. At press time, the 
individual champions and over
all team winnershad not been de
termined.
Last year, CMU finished fifth 
overall in the womens competi
tion and sixth in the mens com
petition. Womens coach Julie 
Babler commented that her team 
had been looking forward to the 
tournament. For most of this 
Spring season, the team has been 
talking about playing in Atlanta 
against these teams, she said.

him on as he lunged forward ten 
meters from the finish and

According to the official scores 
posted after Sundays competi
tion, the CMU mens team was 
tied with three other teams for 
fourth place. The women were in 
last place. However, due to the 
UAA rules, consolation matches 
earn points as well as the champi
onship round matches; The Tar
tan teams did well in their conso
lation matches which will move 
them up in the overall scoring.
The first CMU win came from 
singles player Beth Cavanaugh. 
This was the only win by either 
team in the championship rounds.
Cavanaugh faced Case West
ern Reserves Monica Kinscher in 
thefirst round and won in straight 
sets, 6-2,6-4. The junior then went 
on to play Brandeis RebeccaStem 
on Sunday.
Cavanaugh struggled through 
the entire match. Nothing was 
working, she commented. Stern 
took the match handily, 6-0, 6-0.
Although the men did not do 
well in the singles championship 
rounds, they did exceptionally 
well in doubles. All three mens 
dubs teams won their opening 
matches.
The #1 double team, made up of 
seniors Graham Mac McAfee
and Keith Grumet, cruised to an 
easy 6-1, 6-2 
win over New 
York Univer
sitys Gregor 
Nassief and 
David AckerShe defeated Case Westerns 
Sabitha Rajan for seventh place 
overall. Dottor joked after her 6-3

that she could win a match.
Cavanaugh played her consola

second flight yesterday, against 
Michele Klocke of the University 
of Rochester. Alice Garber fin; 
ished sixth as a #4 seed by defeat; 
ing Niki Black of Case Western. 
She then lost to Temoy Capria of 
University of Chicago 6-4, 6-3.
Coach Babler said of her team, 
All the girls played 100%. There 
was a match this morning where 
a girl from Rochester just quit 
[playing hard] midway through 
the second set. None of our girls 
would do something like that. 
She hoped her team would finish 
about fifth or sixth in the team 
competition, due to the high qual
ity talent of the UAA teams.
Since CMU would not bus the 
womens team to the Monroeville 
Raquet Club during the cold 
weeks preceding the UAAs, Ba
bler was not able to give her team 
thepractice itneeded. Itsridiculous that Carnegie Mellon cannot 
take care of its athletes the same 
as these other UAA schools do,

Other throwers placed well in

winner both tied the UAA record 
at six feet six inches. Sam Liu

a jump of 42 feet, 10 and one half

With the combined efforts of 
both the field crew as well as the

URC sending crew to national competition
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The University Rowing Club 
(tJRC) at Carnegie Mellon is as
piring to go on to bigger and bet
ter things, sending a crew to na
tional competition at Dad Vails in 
Philadelphia in two weeks.
Last weekend, the URC com
peted in an invitational against 
teams from Xavier University of 
Cincinnati, Miami University of 
Oxford, Ohio, Duquesne, and Pitt. 
Carnegie Mellon walked away 
with one first, two seconds, and 
one third place finish.
In the Heavyweight Mens 
Fours competition, CMU captured 
the top spot. The boat crewed by 
Dan Ross, Glenn Pasewwicz, 
Shawn Ohler, Ted Ralphs, and 
cox Sophie Chiang came in ahead 
of second place Duquesne by two 
boat lengths. Xavier came in third. 
According to Coach Liz Winter, 
It was a great race. They rowed 
away from Duquesne at the half
way point, and then had a great 
ending sprint to finish ahead of 
Duquesne.
'This is the crew which will be 
competing in the novice level at 
the Rowing Division II competi
tion at Dad Vails. Rowing Divi
sion II is the equivalent of NCAA 
Division II and III competition. 
Duquesnes novice four boat will 
also be in attendance, but at the 
varsity level. No rowing scholars 
will be racing in this event.
Winter is very optimistic about 
the URC involvement at Dad
Vails. She feels that the team, 
should do well. Even if we dont 
place, it will be great for the expe
rience. I believe that we stand a 
chance.
Two CMU crews placed in the 
top four in the Lightweight Mens 
Fours. Coming in third behind 
Duquesne and Miami was the boat 
of Rudy Zung, Bill Posega, Peter 
Blossey, Peter Chan, and cox 
Chiang.
It was a good race for us be
cause this is the first time this 
team, all novices, has raced on 
the varsity level, said Winter.
Right on their tail was the fourth 
place boat, also from Carnegie 
Mellon. Rowing here were Tho
mas Hoeffel, Dave Molder, Harry 
Printz, John Knight, and cox 
Maria Cole.

Fours, Carnegie Mellon finished

Baseball has dismal 0-5 
start of spring season
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Staffwriter
Its a mild understatement to 
say that the beginning of the 
, spring season has been tough on 
the CMU Baseball Club. The 
weather has caused the cancella
tion of seven of the first 12 games, 
and the Tartans have found them
selves on the losing end of the 
score in the five that were played.
The latest pair of setbacks came 
at the hands of Community Col
lege of Beaver County (CCBC)in 
a doubleheader played Sunday. 
The first game featured great 
pitching by CCBC right hander 
Ken Summers, who held the Tar
tans to just three hits and struck 
out nine in a 5-1 decision.
The Tartans sole run came in 
the fifth inning as Perry Pierces 
fielders choice scored left fielder 
Daryl Marvin from third. Marvin, 
however, had reached third by a 
pair of errors by CCBC.
The Tartans best chance came 
when singles by Warren Flax and 
Mike Gess, coupled with a steal of 
second by Gess, gave the Tartan 
men on second and third with 
only one out. However, a pair of 
infield grounders killed the rally, 
leaving the runners stranded. In 
fact, Flax had three singles, but 
was left on base each time.
CMU pitcher Matt Pampena 
was hit hard early, giving up three 
runs in the second inning, includ
ing a two run homer by catcher 
Ray Brooks and a costly fielding 
error by right fielder Moose Shah.
The second game was called 
after five innings, but the last two 
innings were merely a formality 
with the Tartans down 12 to 2.
The Tartans only rally came in 
the second when the Tartans 
strung hits by Pampena and Mike 
Petrich together with a deep sac
rifice fly by Marvin to score two 
runs.
Although the results were the 
same, the double header losses at 
home against LaRoche College 
were much more competitive, both 
being decided in the late innings.
The first game was tied 2-2 at 
the end of the seventh inning (dou
bleheader games only go seven 
innings), but LaRoche batted 
around in the eighth and scored 
four runs to win 6-2.
One of the few highlights of the 
game was a 4 for 4 performance 
by first baseman Pierce and the 
early pitching of Chris Rabold. 
Pierce also drove in both CMU 
runs as the Tartans put three hits 
back-to-back in the fifth inning to

Marta Fuenteabla, Anna Loney, 
Terry McCloud, Denise Visconti, 
and cox Chan rowed varsity for 
the first time and had a good race, 
nearly taking second.
Winter commented on the dedi
cation of the women in the URC. 
We have extremely dedicated 
women. A good proportion of them 
are seniors, so we need ambitious 
athletes in the fall who want to 
take something like Dad Vails 
and compete as novice rowers in 
the Nationals.
In novice competition, the Nov
ice Mens Fours also finished third 
and fourth behind Duquesne and 
Xavier. Oarsmen in the third 
place boat were Hoeffel, Posega, 
Mike Barry, Brain Carter, and 
cox Cole. The fourth place boat 
was rowed by Blossey, Chad 
Dorson, Mark Thomson, Matt 
Wagner, and cox Chan.
The Novice Womens Fours was 
run in two heats. In the prelimi
nary heat, a boat made up of 
McCloud, Ellen Barry, cox Zung, 
and two rowers from Xavier 
knocked out a URC boat from the 
final heat. Rowers of the boat were 
Cole, Liz Gross, Cheri Soriano, 
Robin Garber, and cox Hoeffel. 
Garber replaced Barry in the 
CMU-Xavier boat in the final heat, 
and the boat finished second 
behind Miami.

Tennis teams do well in 
championship tournament
[The schedule] is so bad. There 
no reason why we couldnt p|| 
more matches on Saturday...? 
exhausted and have one mo 
match to play.
The schedule and war 
weather began to take their t< 
on the over 100 players. As Su 
day progressed, trainers we 
kept busy with applyingice pack 
wrapping knees, and massagii 
tired muscles.

nationally ranked players like 
Noel Occomy from Brandeis and 
Emorys Gavin OConnell (who 
beat McAfee 6-1,6-0), theUAAis 
a great tournament in which to 
compete and learn.
Scheduling of matches was the 
only element of the tourney that 
aggravated the players. After 
playing a singles and a doubles 
match on Saturday, most players 
were required to play as many as 
four separate matches on Sun
day. McAfee said on Sunday after 
two doubles and a singles match,
Were getting the men on base, but 
theyre being stranded there. 
H second baseman Mike Gess
one hit in the next three innings. 
Single runs in the fifth and sixth 
innings brought the Tartans back 
to a tie score before the three-run 
seventh.
A few notable Tartan perform
ances: designated hitter Phil 
Tubesing had a single and a 
double, Pierce went 2 for 4, and 
shortstop Petrich was 1 for 3 with 
a sacrifice fly in the sixth.
The losses this week, coupled 
with a 5-0 shutout against Steu
benville, puts the teams record 
at 0-5. However, according to 
second baseman Gess, The atti
tude is still pretty good. Were 
getting the men on base, but 
theyre being stranded there. 
Weve got to give our pitching 
some run support by getting good 
games for all our hitters at the 
same time. Usually, only two or 
three batters have good games 
each time out.
Gess also adds, Were very 
pleased with the pitching so far. 
Were getting better pitching than 
we expected. Theyre showing a 
lot of promise.
The Tartans next action comes 
on Tuesday with a double header 
against Waynesburg at Mellon 
Park. The Tartans split the fall 
meeting with Waynesburg, but 
the Tartans, coming off of a days 
rest, are optimistic about their 
chances for the upcoming games.

By KEVIN BARNEY
Assistant Features Editor
Ultimate frisbee kicked off its 
season, while indoor soccer con
tinued its season last week in IM 
sports.
In a close game with some rough 
playing, NROTC went up against 
the Trojans in indoor soccer and 
won, 4-3. On the ultimate field, 
EPP beat the Iron City Maidens, 
11-2.
In Wednesdays soccer game, 
there were a number of injuries. 
Right after their third shot on 
goal, one of the Trojans touched 
the ball with his hands, resulting 
in a penalty kick. A few seconds 
later, an NROTC man went down 
after being hit in the groin with 
the soccer ball.
The Trojans Mark Kaplowitz 
sent an easy shot into the NROTC 
net for the first goal of the game. 
The first period ended without 
any more scoring.
In the second period, the 
NROTC team came alive and 
showed the Trojans that this 
would not be an easy game to win. 
About halfway through the sec
ond period, Lane Boland of 
NROTC tied the game.
For the rest of the second pe
riod, the struggle to take the lead 
became more intense as the play
ers fought for control of the game 
and the ball. With a few seconds 
left, NROTCs Marty Reed scored 
the first of his two goals, giving 
NROTC a 2-1 halftime lead.
The third period started with 
the Trojans tying the game with a 
goal by Frank Autenreith. How
ever, NROTC was not going to 
give up easily and Kevin 
Hakimzadeh broke away from the 
pack and went one-on-one with 
the goalie. Hakimzadeh scored to 
give NROTC the one point advan
tage, 3-2.
With under a minute left in the 
third period, Reed put pressure 
on the Trojan goalie. Reeds shot 
bounced off of the goalie and went 
in to give NROTC a two point lead 
as the third period ended.
The fourth period started with 
NROTC putting the offensive 
pressure on the Trojans. Halfway 
through the period, Brent 
Maxwell was dribbling the ball 
downcourt, when a Trojan player 
attempted to steal it from him. 
Both players went down, and 
Maxwell stayed down. Security 
was called, and Maxwell was 
helped off the field. After seeing 
the doctor, Maxwell was told that 
he has a severly bruised bone.
Play resumed with a Trojan 
offensive, which turned into a 
little pushing and shoving match 
that had to be broken up by the of
ficials. Later in the same offen
sive drive, Ben Schoenberg of the 
Trojans scored to bring his team 
within one point. However, time 
ran out for the Trojans, and 
NROTC claimed the 4-3 victory.
Last Wednesday, a perfect day 
to be outside, the IM ultimate 
season started with a lopsided 
game. The Iron City Maidens, a 
team comprised of all women, 
faced off against a coed EPP. EPP 
had a definite height advantage; 
the average EPP player had at 
least a foot on the average Iron 
City Maiden player.
The scoring started early when 
Iron City Maiden player Shelley 
Pressley caught a pass in the end 
zone. EPP replied with a pass to 
John Toll that tied the game.
On the next play, the Maidens 
dropped a pass, and EPP capital
ized on it with a pass from Danielle 
Resendiz to Dave Reed. With a 
one point lead, EPP saw their 
height advantage and took steps 
to increase their lead.
EPP would gain control of the 
frisbee, and then one team mem
ber would run down the field. The 
frisbee is thrown the length of the 
field, and the tallest EPP player 
in the end zone would end up with 
the frisbee and another point for 
EPP. This strategy continued for 
the duration of the first half, which 
ended with EPP leading by a score 
of 6-1.
Since their strategy worked so 
well in the first half, EPP decided

to stick with it for the rest of the 
game. With EPP up by a score of 
9-1, the Iron City Maidens were 
heard from again when Pressley 
scored her second point of the 
game.
Another few minutes passed, 
and EPP had won the game by a 
nine point margin. The high scorer 
of
probably the tallest person on the 
EPP team. Other high scorers 
included Toll with 3 and ric 
Males with 2.
The Iron City Maidens were at 
a definite disadvantage because 
of their height, but in the true 
spirit of good sportsmanship j ttyey 
asked EPP to continue playing

alcohol on a more regular basis.
By DANIEL DOWHAN
Tartan Staffuiriter
I There is a terrible disease sweeping 
licross this campus. This epidemic aflfcts hundreds of students at this uniiersity and millions nationwide every 
Bear at this time.
I The victims become unproductive, apa[Hietic, and act like they are above it all. 
|*ou might have seen these people around 
Pmpus; maybe you are a victim of this 
|"ehibilitating illness yourself. This is 
disease that is commonly known as 
penioritis.
I But what exactly is Senioritis? What 
tjre the causes, the symptoms? Going 
Prectly to the victims seems to be the 
pst way to try and understand this 
[social illness.
Paradoxically, whereas senioritis suf
ferers lose interest and talent in many 
=reas, they seem to become very adeptat 
ertain math problems, such as being 
*ble to calculate the number ofhours left 
til graduation day. Incidentally, that 
figure happens to be about 624 as of 
today.
Another useful math trick, according
technical writer Laura Lerr.ay, is caleulating your grades exactly so you can
find out what you can blow off and still 
graduate.
Lethargy, apathy, and fear are the 
main symptoms of Senioritis, according 
to guitar performance major Scott 
Seifried. Scott should know, because, 
after going to college for six years, he 
should be considered an Expert Senior at 
this time. Ive had Senioritis ever since 
my fourth year, he confesses.
Physics major Dat Dapper Ngo ex
plains the symptoms of lethargy. People 
with job offers blow off their classes. 
People with grad school acceptances blow 
off their classes. And me, I donthave ei
ther, but Im still blowing off my classes. 
According to the senior mentality, when 
you have worked as hard as you do at 
Carnegie Mellon for so long, it only seems 
logical that you have earned a little time 
off.
But while their college careers may be 
very nearly over as of this week, for 
many seniors this feeling of laziness 
started much earlier. I havent been 
able to study since Spring Break, ad
mits one graduating mechanical engi
neering student. Other students who are 
normally in the A or B grade range are 
turning into C level students this semes
ter.
And yes, some seniors are drinking a 
little bit more than usual lately. Ive 
drunk more this semester than I have in 
the other seven semesters combined,
claimed one afflicted senior. Another 
senior went as far as to say that hes 
spent more time in bars than in class this 
spring.
Other blowing-off activities include 
going to Pirate games, watching the 
Penguins in the play-offs, playing sports 
yourself on the Cut, or playing computer 
games. But everyones favorite activity 
is just plain slouching.
Seniors become apathetic as they be
gin to realize that they are about to enter 
the real world. Why bother with this 
little kids stuff? D is for Diploma. It is 
also for Done, interprets one qualitypoint watcher. Yet afterthree and seveneights years at of schooling at The Pro
fessional Choice, some habits are too 
difficult to break completely. Some Sen
iors actually still go to class, but once 
there, they are unlikely to pay much at
tention. Reading newspapers has become 
a popular classroom activity for victims 
of Senioritis.
Applied history major Mark Paskow
sky received a job offer on Thursday, and 
lrntanued rn iyEe 2J
Senior Scott Seifried stands in Hunt Library, but is he is truly concentrating on what 
hes doing? Senioritis, in its advanced stages, robs the victim of all desire to do any 
work. Thus, even in a serious setting, a senior is likely to just put up the appearance 
of working while actually dreaming of graduation.

SARC aids student/alumni exchange
By STEPHEN PETERS
Tartan Staffwriter
Have you ever wondered what 
life is like for alumni? Did you 
ever consider what life was like at 
Cargegie Mellon before your il
lustrious arrival? Have you ever 
needed advice on important ca
reer decisions, but didnt know 
anyone with the experience to 
help?
 If these questions have been 
eating you, the Student Alumni 
Relations Council (SARC) has the 
answers for you. SARC sponsors 
d program, known as Carnegie 
Exchange, in which local alumni 
ihvite a small group of students 
. into their homes for an open dis
cussion of school, jobs, life, the 
-good old days at Carnegie Mellon, interviewing skills and tac
tics, and even such heatedly-disGussed topics as where to go for a 
E.rd haircut.
Also included in the program is 
& snack or possibly even a full dinneir provided by the alumnus or 
lumna hosting. To take advan
tage of this unusual and informa
tive program, all you have to do is 
notify SARC that you are inter
ested in participating; see the end 
bfthis article.
' Notlongago,I,aneagerTartan 
Staffwriter, was invited to par
ticipate in a Carnegie Exchange 
program.
' Christine Sunseri, a former 
math/IM/econ major now work'ihg for Mellon Bank as the man
ager of operations planning and 
research for electronic cash man
agement products, invited a group 
'of six students to her house for an 
Evening. The time we spent talk
ing with her was very informa
tive, for it shed light on many 
questions that are hard to answer 
from within the university.
Sunseri had good information 
"about finding a job and what 
employers look for. For example, 
Hri" case you were wondering if 
QPA really has much of an effect 
on your chances for a job, she told 
us that Mellon wont even inter
view a student with lower than a 
3.0. This is a Mellon Bank policy, 
and not necessarily her opinion. 
Tm not adverse to people with 
Tow QPAs. I look for confidence. 
Im looking for someone who will 
;tie a good team member, who is 
articulate, and can stand up and 
'look you in the eye. Sunseri had 
P.ztae advice for those of us who 
were thinking of studying in 
'fttirope. The fact that you would 
pick up and go to Europe shows 
something positive in you. If you 
'Want to start at a prestigious 
institution, they want people as 
1 worldly as they are. You should 
know at least one foreign lan
guage. Knowing a foreign lan- guage is a head start.
She was disappointed with our 
negative attitudes toward CMU. 
Apparently things were different 
when she graduated in 84. 
Students arent aware of how 
approachable the administration 
is. Jay Devine was great help 
with my major, she related. 
CMU helps you out personally, if 
you look for it. While we blamed 
the workload for negative atti
tudes, she admonished us with 
They are conservatives at CMU. 
They want you to be at your books 
studying so you learn something. 
Other things have changed quite 
a bit since she graduated. The 
number of undergraduates has 
doubled since 84, which explains 
why CMU is so short of classroom 
and housing space now. Also, the 
male:female ratio used to be 20:1.
Sunseri had many good things 
to say about CMU. CMU teaches 
you how to think and solve prob
lems. Thats what companies pay 
for. She advised us to create our 
own majors if we were having
problems fitting into the pre
formed ones. Apparently its not 
to hard.
According to Sunseri, going to 
work is like going to college after 
high school. Its a whole new 
routine to learn. Getting a job is 
just the beginning. When you go 
for an interview she advised to 
know the company well. You 
just studied for four long years. 
The least you can do is spend 1/2 
hour studying the company. The 
corporate report is a good thing to 
read. She also advised talking to 
alumni employed by the company 
youre interested in. Naturally, if 
they dont like it there, you might 
not either. As far as internships 
go, its not where you are, but 
what you do thats important. Go 
somewhere where you can learn 
something. Its better to go to a 
small company and do something 
important than go to IBM and 
operate the photocopy machine.

Progressive Minds

is currently hiring articulate 
individuals with a concern for 
the environment.

Sunseri also took the opportu
nity to plug alumni donations. 
Alumni benefit from the present 
reputation of their alma mater. If 
a donation will help continue the 
good reputation of that alma 
mater, its only natural to donate 
some money. She thought the 
University Center was a good idea, 
because a better campus quality 
of living would continue to at
tract top students who would 
continue CMLFs excellent repu
tation.
If you would like to meet some 
alumni under similar circum
stances, contact SARC through 
the public relations office, located 
on Forbes Avenue in the old house 
in front of Phi Kappa Theta.
In our two hour stay at Sunseris home we learned many 
useful things we would never h ave 
discovered otherwise. As for Car
negie Exchange: its worth the 
trip.

Students listen intently as alumna Christine Sunseri sheds light on life 
after Carnegie Mellon.
Happy birthday, dear William ...
William Shakespeare turned 425 this weekend. Loyal supporters were on hand to commerate 
the event by placing flowers and balloons across his statue, which is located on Forbes Avenue 
outside of Carnegie Music Hall. Less than a block from the statue observers can see a memorial 
fountain inscribed with Shakespeares immortal Words from The Merchant of Venice concerning 
the value of mercy.
HOW I MADE $18,000 
FOR COLLEGE 
BY WORKING WEEKENDS.
When my friends and I graduated from high school, we all took part-time jobs to pay for college.They ended up in car washes and hamburger joints, putting in long hours for little pay.Not me. My job takes just one weekend a month and two weeks a year. Yet, Im earning $18,000 for college.Because I joined my local Army National Guard.
Theyre the people who help our state during emergencies like hurri
canes and floods. Theyre also an important part of our countrys military defense.So, since Im helping them do such an important job, theyre helping me make it through school.
As soon as I finished Advanced Training, the Guard gave me a cash bonus of $2,000. Im also getting another $5,000 for tuition and books, thanks to the New GI Bill.Not to mention my monthly Army Guard paychecks. Theyll add up to more than $11,000 over the six years Im in the Guard.And if I take out a college loan, the Guard will help me pay it back-up to $1,500 a year, plus interest.It all adds up to $18,000or more for college for just a little of my time. And thats a heck of a better deal than any car wash will give you.
THE GUARD CAN HELP PUT YOU THROUGH COLLEGE, TOO.

Well trained students can 
find trouble in Paradise
drn t
orbbs
Carnival is over, and not a 
moment too soon. Dont get me 
wrong. I love Carnival; it pro
vides a boundless field of come
dic opportunities for idea-hun
gry columnists like me.
After all, what Carnival 
would be complete without some 
sexually repressed cynic mak
ing bad jokes about high school 
girls and throwing up in the 
Gravitron. Well, I refuse to be 
cynical. I would also refuse to 
be sexually repressed, but thats 
not entirely up to me. At any 
rate, the point I am making 
here is that I love Carnival, but 
it provides another outlet for 
the number one Carnegie Mel
lon Pastime: complaining.
Imagine the following situ
ation: you are walking down 
the Cut and meet an acquain
tance. You stop and say hello. 
Eventually you make the mis
take of asking How are you? 
Immediately you bite your 
tongue; hope that some cata
clysmic disaster will save you 
from what you know is coming; 
unfortunately the Cathedral of 
Learning doesnt explode, a 
horde of fraternity guys doesnt 
stream out of Doherty and 
pound you; instead youre sub
jected to the worst experience 
of all: your acquaintance starts 
to speak and the pain begins.
Well I just pulled my eighty 
sixth all-nighter in the week 
and I have consumed more cof
fee than the entire state of Min
nesota because exams are com
ing in a few months dnd I have 
to start preparing now because 
if I fail my father will castrate 
me with a dull spoon and I real1 
ize I have a 4.0 but thats not 
the point because if my GPA 
goes down in any small amount 
I am never going to get a job and
I am going to lose the physical 
beauty I have spent all of these 
years cultivating and I will never 
get married to the person of my 
dreams because Ill be a social 
reject and Ill become a bag per
son and sell pencils for a living 
and Ill lose all of my teeth and die 
a miserable death!!!
Fifteen minutes have passed 
since you asked the fatal ques
tion. Your pulse is quickening, 
you dont know if you can take 
any more of it before your brain 
explodes and comes streaming out 
of your eye sockets. Warning lights 
are going off all over your body. 
Soon you realize that youre late 
for class, and as your acquain
tance stops for breath you yelp, 
Im late for class and run like a 
yuppie at a Motorhead concert.
Now, during Carnival one would 
believe that the joy of the situ
ation would assuage the stream 
of complaints that normally spews 
out of the mouths of most CMU 
students. Au contraire, monfrere! 
It gets worse! Its as if all CMU 
students have been so conditioned 
to be miserable at every opportu
nity that when the time comes to 
be happy and party and fornicate 
like lemmings it is no longer a 
part of our psyche!
So, imagine yourself in the same 
situation; only now it is the Sat
urday of Carnival. Thinking that 
the coast is clear because it is 
during Carnival, you make the 
crucial error once again: How 
are you doing?
I am on my eighty sixth allnighter of the week and Ive con
sumed more coffee than the en
tire state of Minnesota because I 
am pushing buggy for three dif
ferent organizations at the same 
time but we all placed in the final 
race so I have to push all three 
buggies in the same race and our 
booth exploded because our de
signer didnt make provisions for 
the nuclear fission reactor thats 
an integral part of our game so 
now theres a good chance that 
well be disqualified as a fire 
hazard and because I am a Tar
tan staffwriter I have to write re
views for twenty events but I only 
attended one of them and my 
sister came to visit but she was 
blinded by a laser beam from the 
light show right before being 
carried away by five men during a 
frat party and my parents wont 
understand and I will lose all of 
the beauty I have spent all of 
these years cultivating and I will 
never be able to find a job and die
a miserable death!!!
Unfortunately for the poor 
victim, there are no classes for 
which to be late, there are nQ 
tests or obligations; it is, after 
all, Spring Carnival.
There is nothing left for you 
but despair; the ear numbing, 
brain splitting weight of a thpusand misguided extracurricu
lar activities all falling upon 
your unwitting sensibility. 
Three hours later your acquain
tance is walking around with a 
clean, unemotional slate, and 
why? They have unloaded the 
weight of the world on your 
shoulders.
Accuse me of spite; its okay. 
The crime goes on; now I hav 
unloaded my anxieties on you 
and, in time, you will go up to 
some acquaintance and once 
they have asked you How are 
you, you will know exactly 
what to sayWell, I just read 
this really disturbing article in 
The Tartan and ... 
This is my last complaint of 
the year. The next edition of 
Dont Worry Be Javi will be 
dedicated to that one area, of 
my writing that has remained 
constant since I began writng 
this column two semesters ago.
I will be presenting a gallery 
of the best of Coming Soon[ 
Coming a Little Bit Later Than 
That / Coming a Lot Later Than 
That Last one. The best, the 
worst, and even the ones that 
The Tartan refused to print, 
until this issue.
There is, however, one final 
item in my agenda for this week. 
Since the end of the semester is 
upon us, I will soon be needipg 
a new title for my column. .
There are only two simple 
rules, the title should refer to 
travel in some way, since I will 
be studying in London next se
mester and I will be mailing 
my columns from abroad. AJso, 
the logo should include ,the 
name Javi in an amusing I 
manner involving the title of a 
popular song, film, or literary 
work. Drop any suggestions 
via campus mail to Don^t 
Worry, Be Javi, in care of the 
Tartan, at the Skibo Informa
tion Desk, Box 17.
The individual who composes 
the winning entry will receive 
a genuine post card from abroad 
valued at something over fifty 
cents, depending on the ex
change rate and the price.of 
postage. Best cf luck!

Chess club to host a memorial tournament 
to honor a deceased former member
By KIRK YENERALL
Tartan Staffwriter
After only two years of opera
tion, the Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity Chess Club is one of the 
campus newer organizations. The 
club began in the fall of 1987, 
when two groups of chess lovers, 
one consisting of freshmen and 
the other made up of upperclass
men, met and officially co-founded 
the present organization.
The clubs meetings, which are 
held in Skibo every Thursday eve
ning at 7 pm, are informal and 
consist only of people who love 
the game getting together and 
playing.
; For the past two years, the club 
l>as entered a team in the Pitts
burgh Chess League, and has had 
Remarkable success in this en
deavor. During the 1987-88 sea
son, Carnegie Mellons team, cap
tained by Matt Murbach, fin
ished second out of eight teams in 
their division.
. They won five of their seven 
matches, losing one to the first 
lace team of their division, and 
drew the other. The team con
sisted of Mike Karian at first 
board, Brad Wyatt at second 
board, Dave Hochron at third 
board, and Vidal Graupera at 
fourth board. Louis Blair, CharlesDunston, and Matt Murbach 
tyere the teams alternates.
: ^Wyatt provided an outstanding 
individual performance: he won 
every game he played during the 
season, and was awarded a board 
prize at the end of the season for 
his accomplishments.
The clubs success in the Chess 
League continued this year, de
spite the loss of three of last years 
starters to graduation. In fact, 
this years team finished first in 
its section  winning all but one 
of its matches and drawing the 
remaining one. This years team 
featured Brad Wyatt at first board 
and Brian Gabera at second board, 
with Carl Lingen, Ben Schoen
berg, Mike Austin, and Murbach 
sharing the duties at third and 
fourth boards. Fine individual ef
forts were made by Wyatt, who 
again won a board prize, and also 
by Gabera, who narrowly missed 
winning a board prize.
The club has many plans for the 
future. Pre-eminent among these 
is the upcoming Mike Karian Me
morial Tournament to be held in 
Room 206 of the Wightman School
Building on Sunday, April 30. This 
tournament, the first ever to be 
sponsored by the club, has been 
dedicated to the memory of Mike 
Karian, a loyal 1987-88 chess club 
member who tragically commit
ted suicide in November of 1988 
at the age of 22 while working at 
AT&T. He is deeply missed by 
those who knew him, and who 
hope that this tournament will 
serve as a small tribute to his 
memory and will increase suicide 
awareness in the community. The 
proceeds of the tournament will 
be donated to Contact Pittsburgh, 
a crisis intervention service.
The Chess Club will participate 
in the Pittsburgh Chess League 
next year, and the group plans to 
hold more tournaments as well. 
Furthermore, the club also an
ticipates sending a team to the 
next Pan-American Tournament, 
which is an inter-collegiate tour
nament held during winter break.
Participating members stress 
that the Chess Club is a place
where anyone, regardless of skill 
level, can stop by and enjoy a 
game of chess. They actively 
encourage any interested stu
dents to take advantage of this 
great opportunity to enjoy one of 
the worlds most ancient and fas
cinating games.
The registration fee for the 
upcoming Mike Karian Memorial 
Chess tournament will be five dol
lars. Registration will be held at 
the Wightman School Building 
from 10 am to 10:45 am.
If you wish to register in ad

Donuts. Good donuts. On cam
pus, yet. Carnegie Mellon Dining 
Service has started selling fresh 
Dunkin Donuts in the foyer of 
Morewood Gardens on a trial 
basis.
As if life wasnt tough enough 
for the average Carnegie Mellon 
University student already, now 
he or she must face the tempta
tion of good donuts on his or her 
way through Morewood. It is 
perhaps most cruel that the loca
tion of the donut stand falls out
side of the Morewood Recreation 
Room, where exercise entheusiasts participate daily in aerobics 
classes.
Luckily, though, the stand is 
only there on a trial basis.; if the 
donuts dont sell, the diet-busting 
temptation will be removed from

Kappa Sigs spatula-wielding cook retires
By STEVEN PETERS
fartan Staffwriter
After thirty-seven years as 
Kappa Sigmas cook, Alberta 
jlcCall-Gant is retiring. Known 
'as The Power of Delta Alpha 
Kappa Sigs Carnegie Mellon 
ihapter) Alberta is more than a 
iiok, shes an institution. Despite 
he fact that she rules with a 
ipatula, Alberta is much more 
han a cook to the Kappa Sigs.
Despite their relative lack of 
discipline these days, Alberta still 
oves her second family. I have 
ots of love to give. Love isnt love 
until you give it away. After 
twenty years of cooking for the 
fraternity they initiated her as a 
jister. She also brags about havng the only sweetheart pin.
Retiringduetohealth problems, 
Alberta says, If I had to do it all 
over again, Id do it the same 
ay. To show their apprecia
tion, the brothers threw her a re
tirement party last Saturday and 
>ave her a plaque for her service 
jver the years.
The brothers had several intersting stories to tell about her. 
Alberta has always been pretty 
juick to paddle anyone who gives
her any lip, andrecentlyshebroke 
a paddle on the back of a brother. 
Also, once in the 50s ten brothers 
skipped dinner to go to Allies (a 
bar now known as Panther Hol
low). Alberta found out where they 
were and chased after them with 
her spatula. When the brothers 
heard she was coming, they 
slipped out the back door into the 
alley. Unfortunately for them, she 
was too clever for them and was 
waiting for them in the alley. 
Alberta grabbed two brothers by 
the hair and dragged them back 
to the house. The other eight 
brothers preferred to follow un
der their own power. Another 
time, Alberta pinned down a 
purse-snatcher until the police 
could arrive.
The affection felt between Al
berta and her second family is 
obvious. She will be tough to 
replace. Alberta had one message 
for the younger generation, 
Please stay in school and get 
your education. Its very impor
tant.
The Kappa Sigma brothers also 
commerated Alberta's years of 
work by dedicating one of their 
building blocks from their Carni
val booth to her.

Seated with Kappa Sig cook Alberta McCall-Gant and her husband 
Eddie Gant, here on their wedding day, are alumnus Pete Kundel, to 
McCaii-Gants right, and grad student John Kaufman, to Gant's left.

Sigma kitchen.
Students come down with 
puzzling illness in last year
lrntanued zbrT iyEe 2!
promptly blew the whole day 
off. I havent been this relaxed 
in a long time. Everyone else I 
talked to today was so tense its 
unbelievable.
The tension around campus 
is probably due to Senioritis 
symptom number three, fear. 
Seniors begin to panic as the 
days fly past if they are still 
jobless. After working your tail 
off for four years and paying 
upwards of $60,000 to do it, get
ting a job should be a given. 
Often it is not; time to panic. 
Cover letters and credit card 
applications are being sent out 
by the dozens.
Senioritis is not wanting to 
leave, yet wanting to get out. 
One graduating economics 
major explained that there are 
a lot of traditions and friends 
that will be sad to leave  but 
I don't want to do any more 
work!
But what really makes Sen
ioritis different from the desire 
all students feel for the semes
ter to end? While the weather
gets warmer and the hemlines 
rise higher, everyone is getting 
a bit lazy and crazy. Perhaps 
someone who teaches seniors 
might have an insight into this 
question.
According to one teacher in 
the English department, you 
can identify seniors as the ones 
that keep missing class because 
of plant trips. Actually, most 
of the seniors have been miss
ing class all year, not just now.
Philosophy Professor Jon
athan Pressler shared his ideas 
as to defining the symptoms of 
Senioritis. He noted that sen
iors have a tendency to skip 
classes and to do a less thor
ough job on assignments than 
they would normally do. Th * 
seniors are also noteworthy in 
that they openly express de
sire to be done with CMU.
But again, is this behavior re
ally all that different from the ' 
behavior of juniors at this time 
of year?
I think its a matter of de
gree, concludes Professor  
Pressler. No pun intended.

Registration horror stories tell of endless lines, infinitely closed courses
By B. THOMAS SCHMIDT
Tartan Staff writer
Writers note: The following 
article is a fictionalized account 
of the trials and tribulations of 
annual registration lines.
None of the persons mentioned 
in the account actually exist; any 
resemblence to any person living 
or dead is merely a stupid coinci
dence.
These characters do, however, 
represent the opinions of some 
students concerning the entire 
registration process.
Junior electrical engineering 
major Tom Crowe hasnt been to 
class in two full days. Hes been 
standing in line since Sunday 
night (April 16) at 8 pm with 
several hundred other sleepy 
students waiting to enroll in CIT 
classes for Fall 89.
Its Tuesday morning, April 
19, and Tom is wondering what 
he is missing. Its not that hes 
anxious to get back to class, its 
just that hes been at Carnegie 
Mellon University long enough 
to realize how much material can
be missed in two days without 
class attendance, and Tom isnt 
anxious to have to make all of it 
up.
It may even mean he will have 
to confer with some of his profes
sors, and Tom cant stand most of 
them. Actually, he rather enjoys 
the waiting as an alternative to 
lectures.
It wasnt always that way. 
Crowe remembers when he was 
a freshman, standing in long 
lines to enroll in classes for Spring 
87.
When he was young and fool
ish, he actually wai ted until Tues
day morning to get in line. It was 
Wednesday afternoon before he 
was signed up for his classes and 
his ideal schedule was totally 
shot.
But standing in this line, Tom 
has made many friends. Friends 
he only sees twice a year on en
rollment days, but he still enjoys 
spending the time waiting in 
these ridiculously long lines with 
them.
By 10 am the line finally starts 
moving and Tom and his friends 
head inside to start the battle.
Its all a matter of dedication, 
Stowe says. I refuse to take 
classes from certain teachers, and 
if you wait too long to get in line, 
you dont have any choice. 
Stowe agrees that missing class 
can be dangerous but insists that, 
in such emergencies as this, it 
cannot be helped.
Hey! If Im gonna sit in a 
cramped room in a cramped desk 
and listen to some guy ramble on 
for an hour or two I wanna at 
least like the guy, Stowe ex
plains.
Indeed, it would seem that 
many students feel the same as 
Stowe and his friends. They were 
located behind 90 to 100 others 
in line. Yeah, a few people beat 
us to it, but they were probably 
out here Sunday morning at 8 
am, Stowe says. I got things to 
do. I got a life.
CIT students arent the only 
ones fighting lines. Students all 
over campus are facing the same 
thing. Freshman H&SS student 
Corey Reich complains: This is 
bullshit, man. They oughta get 
organized and do this by com
puter or something. They do eve
rything else that way.
Still, it seems that most upper
classmen arent bothered by the 
lines at all, since most realize 
how hectic enrollment always is.
Well, you know the Carnegie 
Mellon mentality, one of Stowes 
friends, mechanical engineering 
major Chris Sturges comments, 
They do so much by computer 
already, maybe somebody figured 
they oughta at least do some
thing the old-fashioned way. 
Yeah, Stowe agrees,I mean, 
Carnegie Mellon has always 
prided itself on being different. 
When 80 percent of the colleges 
and universities in the United 
States of America aredoingtheir 
enrollment by computer, Carne
gie Mellon wants to do some
thing different.
They couldve at least picked 
something less time consuming 
to be different about, Reich com
plains.
Stowe still doesnt seem both
ered at all by the lines. For those 
of us who arent involved with 
the Greek system, Stowe con
fesses, this is the biggest social 
event of the year.

CMU Drama presents Peer Gynt
SSasons Xinal show mushSs li/iEs oX 4TSsgS sEudSnEs
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
The last production this year in 
the Kresge Theatre is Henrik 
Ibsens Peer Gynt, directed by 
intemationally-renowned direc
tor Yosef Yossi Yzraely. The 
show opened successfully last 
Saturday evening.
Yzraely is a visiting professor 
in the Drama Department this 
spring. He describes the play as 
the founding play of modern 
theater, and the character Gynt 
as the modem everyman, a man 
in search of himself. The show 
features a cast of more than thirty 
actors and an expanded stage. 
Peer Gynt is one of the biggest 
undertakings, in size and scope, 
that this department has done in 
years, says Yzraely.
From the unspoken opening, 
where stagehands prepare the set 
for Gynts life performance, to the 
emotional ending, Peer Gynt
remains a powerful show. Not 
once does it lose the hold it quickly 
establishes on the audience. The 
first act centers around Gynt as a 
young man, with a riveting per
formance by Paul Kaup as Gynt. 
Gynt is the most playful and 
wondrous here. He moves from 
hopes, to dreams, to ambitions, 
even to wishes of becoming 
emperor. Katherine Selverstone 
is a perfect complement as Gynts 
mother, Aase.
The second act is darker and 
more emotionally forceful than 
the first. It takes us later into 
Gynts life, with Dennis Rees as 
the second Gynt. Rees does a 
marvelous job in showing us Gynt 
still searching for himself, but 
now almost in a desperate way. 
We also hear the words of the 
much older, third Gynt, portrayed 
by Charles Leggett, who has been 
silent until now, watching his life 
played out before him, appearing 
and disappearing almost like a
lost spirit.
Leggett is masterful as the third 
Gynt. His Gynt is, ironically, per
haps the most lost, the most un
sure of who he really is. It is 
touching to watch Gynt as he 
finally confronts the fact that he 
has not been himself all along.
There is often too much going 
on simultaneously, with the set 
as well as the characters, but it 
becomes a spectacle for. the eye 
rather than a confusing mess. 
Much of that credit goes to the 
ensemble. They are onstage at 
various times in few or many 
numbers, as many different char
acters, and prove to be an incred
ible force; they are the absolute 
backbone of the show. They are 
the source of much of Gynts 
motivations, whether they are 
supporting him, or tempting him, 
or simply tormenting him.
The last few moments of the 
show were my favorite; no words 
were needed, just a reappearance
of the mother to the oldest Gynt 
and the quick memory of Peer as 
a little boy, with Yotam Yzraely 
as Little Peer.
The set for Peer Gynt is incred
ible. The Kresge is a very difficult 
place to construct a set that will 
be effective and that will move 
smoothly and effortlessly. Scenic 
Designer Charles Ballew has 
succeeded in providing this, with 
a theater within a theater for 
Gynts life to unfold in. At one 
point the stage is even cleared 
and we take a rare look far back 
into the theater with Gynt, look
ing at himself and at the people 
from his life.
For the first time in quite a 
while I was able to hear everyone 
on the Kresge stage, even in the 
midst of all the effects, and in the 
quiet, tender moments when only 
Gynts voice can be heard. Here, 
more praise for the cast is due, 
and for Sound Designer Carl Ray, 
who receives his BFA in produc
tion with an emphasis in sound 
design this May from Carnegie 
Mellon Drama. Other credits 
include Lighting Designer Rick 
Martin, Stage Manager B. J. Holt, 
Costume Designer Max Wilson, 
Associate Director Victoria Santa 
Cruz, and Steven LedBetter, for 
original music composition.
Director Yzraely holds a Ph.D. 
from Carnegie Mellon Drama. He 
is also a member of the faculty at 
Tel Aviv University in Israel. He 
was the Artistic Director of the 
Habima, Israels National The
atre in Tel Aviv, from 1975-1977. 
Yzraely was named artistic direc
tor of Israels Khan Theatre in 
1984. He concentrates mainly on 
freelance directing projects in 
Israel, Europe, and the U.S.
Yzraely has received many 
awards for his directing. He is a 
five time winner of the Davids 
Harp award for best production 
and best directing. His produc
tion of Nothing is More Complete
Than a Broken Heart for the 
Heidelberg Theatre in Germany 
was selected for the Berlin Festi
val.
Last year, Yzraely was honored 
with the Ibsen Medal by th city 
of Skien, Norway (Ibsens birth
place) for his commitment to 
Ibsens drama. This July Yzraely 
will direct the Three Rivers 
Shakespeare Festivals Antony 
and Cleopatra.
This Drama department sea
son has been dedicated to Eliza
beth Bes Schrader Kimberly. 
The Drama Department honors 
her on her 60th Anniversary as a 
Carnegie Mellon Drama faculty 
member.
Peer Gynt evening perform

Cabaret comes to Heinz Hall
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
This month the Pittsburgh 
Broadway Series brings the new 
production of the musical Caba
ret to Heinz Hall. Directed by Hal 
Prince, the show stars Joel Grey 
in the role of the M.C., which he 
created in 1966 and for which he 
is now famous.
The story of Cabaret is based on 
| John Van Drutens play I Am A 
Camera, which in turn was based 
on stories by Christopher Isherwood. The story captures the lives 
! of a group of people livingin Berlin 
in the late 1920s, just before the 
rise of the Third Reich. It be
comes disturbing and thoughtprovoking as the carefree, forgetyour-troubles times slowly come 
to an end.
The book for Cabaret is by Joe 
Masteroff, with music and lyrics 
by the team of John Kander and 
Fred Ebb. The current produc
tion is a new version; it is not a 
revival of the old show. Master
off s book was revised, as was
Kander and Ebbs score. The 
emcees song I Dont Care Much 
has been restored to the show, 
with Willkommen, Dont Tell 
Mama, The Money Song, and 
the title song all remaining. 
Dances and cabaret numbers were 
choreographed by Ron Field.
The original production of 
Kander and Ebbs Cabaret opened 
on Broadway in the fall of 1966 
and ran for three years, with 1166 
performances. The show earned 
eightTony Awards, includingBest 
Musical. Grey achieved fame and 
Princes directorial career was 
launched.
Joel Grey has a tremendous list 
of accomplishments, but he will 
always be remembered best for 
his portrayal as the grinning, 
playful emcee in Cabaret. His 
performance on Broadway won 
him the Tony for Best Supporting 
Actor in 1967. Grey reprised his 
role in the film version with costars Liza Minelli and Michael 
York and he received an Academy 
Award in 1972 for Best Support
ing Actor.
Grey is a versatile performer, 
with experience in many forms of 
entertainment  stage, screen, 
nightclub and concert venues, and 
television. Greys list of stage 
credits includes an appearance at 
the Palace Theatre in the musical 
George Ml, for which he received 
his second Tony nomination and 
the Variety Critics Award as Best 
Actor in a Musical. Grey also 
portrayed Charles VTI, the Dau
phin of France, in the musical 
Goodtime Charley, the role earned 
him his third Tony nomination.
Grey was honored by the Holly
wood Chamber of Commerce with 
the unveiling of his star on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame. His film 
credits include About Face, Ca
lypso Heat Wave, and Come Sep
tember. His more recent feature 
films include Man on a Swing, 
Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or 
Sitting Bull's History Lesson, and 
The Seven Percent Solution.
Nancy Ringham portrays Sally 
Bowles, the free spirit whose life 
revolves around the cabaret and 
becoming a star. Ringham made
her Broadway debut as Eliza 
Doolittle opposite Rex Harrison 
in the 25th Anniversary produc
tion of My Fair Lady. Ringham 
has performed her own act in New 
York City. She was featured in 
Hey Look Me Over A Tribute to 
Cy Coleman at Lincoln Center. 
She was most recently seen OffBroadway in Liz Swadoss Esther: 
A Vaudeville Magilla.
Marcia Lewis portrays Fraulein 
Schneider. She made her Broad
way debut in Hello Dolly, first 
with Phyllis Diller and then with 
Ethel Merman. She starred for a 
year and a half as Miss Hannigan 
in the Broadway production of 
Annie. Last season, Lewis re
ceived a Drama Desk nomination 
for her performance in Rags. She 
appeared this season in Hal 
Princes Roza.
Michael Allinson, who portrays 
Herr Schultz, is best known for 
his role of Henry Higgins in My 
Fair Lady, which he played on 
Broadway for the last three years 
of the musicals run. He is a nalrntanued rn iyEe 2AM

In honor of the city of Valdez, 
Alaska, Ill be reviewing The 
Toxic Avenger Part II today, but 
first I have a report from my 
environmental advisor, Sissy 
Vleck, who just spent the last two 
weeks sneaking around Prudhoe 
Bay, trying to get Exxon employ
ees to go to bed with her so she 
could find out false information 
she can sell to cheap newspapers 
in England.
The sea otters are faking it, 
Sissy said.
You mean the little cute furry 
weasel-lookin slick-skin whiskery 
piles of gooey black dead stuff 
theyre yankin out of the water? 
Howd you know?
They had it on ESPN. 
Theyre faking it. Theyre not 
really dead.
They look dead on TV. 
Theyre faking it.
And then Sissy went into this 
long explanation about how the 
sea otters are having secret meet
ings every night at Cape Yakataga, Alaska, where they paint 
their bodies with black water 
colors mixed with Elmers glue 
and then practice scrunchin their 
eyes up like constipated Japa
nese lawyers.
Sissy, it sounds a little far
fetched to me. What would be the 
motive for your massive sea-otter 
body-paintin conspiracy? 
Theyre doing it for the public
ity
I didnt think of that, I told 
her.
Think about it. When was the 
last time you thought about a sea 
otter?
At least four, five years. 
Exactly! Nobody ever thinks 
about sea otters, writes about sea 
otters, talks about sea otters. 
National Geographic doesnt even 
care about sea otters. And then 
suddenly  wham!  sea otters 
all over the media. How do you 
explain it?
I never thought about it. 
The sea otters hired a New 
York Media Consultant last year, 
and the guy told em to go endan
gered. 
Go what?
Sea otters have always had 
this image problem. Theyre not 
endangered. Theres lots of em. 
They mate like bunnies. The 
oceans crawlin with sea otters.
; So the consultant says Who wants 
;to hear about some animal thats 
having a good time? Elephants,
; white leopards, Siberian tigers  
those are the hot animals right
now. And why? Because theyre 
endangered. Theyre scarce. 
Theyre like your designer ani
mals. Zoos cant even get em 
anymore. So the first thing you 
got to do is go endangered.
I got you. Im starting to under
stand.
So they did it.
Did what?
They made themselves endan
gered.
How can you do that?
Three million sea otters had 
vasectomies last year.
Sea otter vasectomies?
You dont wanna know how 
they do it. Itd make you sick. 
Take my word for it. It was a 
nasty business.
But what does that have to do 
with sea-otter body paint?
It was just the first step. The 
next thing they did was get ready 
for a major environmental disas
ter. It happened to be the Exxon 
deal. It could have been anywhere 
around the world, because the 
otters were ready.
How could they be ready for 
something like that? 
Freeze-dried sea-otter corpses, 
caked with tar, tossed up on the 
beach like driftwood.
Whered they get the corpses? 
Volunteer sea-otter grandpar
ents.
Say that again.
You ever see a real old sea 
otter right before it dies, when 
the eyes start to get real heavy 
like Bette Davis?
Nope.
You put em on ice, you cant 
tell the difference.
And so with freeze-dried ot
ters, body-painted otters, and 
media advice, the sea otters cap
tured the attention of the media. 
But what do they get out of it? 
You know what the merchan
dising rights are worth on a thing 
like thisstuffed animals, lunch 
boxes, board games, Muppets, 
Saturday-morning TV?
I got you. Disgusting, isnt it? 
Wait till I tell you about the 
dead-otter beach-flopping re
hearsals.

cells, the geniuses at Troma Films

Special to The Tartan
Although art often contains 
loaded messages regardingissues 
like metaphysical conflicts, men
tal torture, existentialism, and 
basic survival in a cruel world, 
some very powerful art can also 
be created out of some of the most 
basic and immediate influences: 
ones surroundings. Both Tanya 
Fletchers and Jennifer Heberts 
work attests to this, and tomor
row a show of their works opens 
at the Forbes Gallery.
Fletcher works primarily in 
colored chalk pastel on paper, with 
her figures and faces rendered in 
the style of portraiture. She uses 
vivid, contrasting colors in a bold, 
impressionistic style to represent 
light and shadow. Deep magen
tas and oranges and chalky aqua 
and lime greens accurately repre
sent intricate human expression, 
and despite their larger-than-life 
size, take on a snapshot quality. 
Her color choices, as well as her 
raw, aggressive marks keep her a 
safe distance from super-realism 
and soft, conventional portraiture.
Fletcher will also exhibit handdyed, plaster-cast reliefs of the
with a sequel to 
The Toxic
Avenger, the sen
sitive story of a 
Jerry Lewis lookalike who falls into a 
vat of lime-green 
nuclear waste, 
comes out looking like a zucchini 
with herpes, and eats half of New 
Jersey. But in The Toxic Avenger 
Part II, Lloyd Kaufman and 
Michael Herz  the producers, 
directors, writers, and caterers of 
Troma Films  have outdone 
themselves, setting world records 
for a) jokes about blind people, b) 
imaginative use of midgets (in
cluding one scene where a midget 
is smushed into a round mass the 
size of basketball and then slamdunked), and c) number of scenes 
featuring a superhero sitting on 
the toilet. Actually, theres only 
one scene featuring a superhero 
sitting on the toilet, but since its 
the only one in the history of 
movies, its still a record.
But all this wasnt enough for 
Lloyd and Mikey. Since they were 
going for the world record in bad 
taste, the plot sends The Toxic 
Avenger to Japan in search of his 
father. Why? So they can make a 
half hour of Japanese ethnic jokes.
A classic. No plot to get in the 
way of the story. 26 breasts. 24 
dead bodies. One dead horse. One 
motor vehicle chase, featuring 
motorcycle, taxi, sem-eye, am
phibious airboat, four crash-andbums, two explosions, and a whole 
lot of meaningless squealing. 
Collapsible wheelchair bodycrushing. Double arm ripping. 
Indian ear-ripping. Head twist
ing. Transvestite machine-gun
ner. Midget ball peen hammer 
attack. Midget slam-dunking. 
Exploding heads. Toxic superhero 
toilet scene (a 99 on the Vomit 
Meter). Monster sex. 146 sight 
gags about the blind. Blind old 
lady machine-gunned out of her 
wheelchair for no apparent rea
son. Thirty scenes of Japanese 
citizens screaming directly into 
the camera. Human nose scalded 
into the shape of a fish. Peaceloving teenagers necking in a 
horse-drawn carriage senselessly 
crushed to death by a giant dump

nominations for Ron Fazio, as the 
first superhero from New Jersey, 
for wielding a mean mop and 
saying Claire, they were sense
lessly butchered and It wasnt 
long before I became a genuine 
emotional basket case; Phoebe 
Legere, the blind girlfriend of 
Toxie, for her two enormous tal
ents (actually, the blind girl from 
Toxic One had bigger hooters, 
but they didnt bring her back for 
the sequel); Mayako Katsuragi, 
as the little Japaheeno girl the 
Toxic Avenger rescues, for saying 
I will do whatever you wish; and 
Lloyd Kaufman and Michael 
Herz, the producers, directors, 
and co-writers, for havingthe guts 
to make a sequel to a movie that 
didnt make sense in the first 
place.
Three stars. Joe Bob says check 
it out.
JOE BOBS ADVICE TO THE 
HOPELESS
Communist Alert! Theyve been 
threatening to do it for a couple 
years now, but the day finally 
came. The government of Son
oma County, Calif., paid $360 000 
for the Sonomarin Drive-! l on 
Highway 101, and the most fa
mous landmark in Northern Cali
fornia is gone. And do you know 
what theyre gonna use it for? A 
flood relief valve. Couldnt they 
have used it for that with the 
people still watching the movies? 
We wouldnt have cared if we got 
a little wet on some nights. You 
generally have to take a shower 
when you get home from the drivein anyhow. Jessie Harack of Peta
luma sent in the final word; pred

eternal vigilance, it can happen

human form.What 
makes these sculp
tures unique is that 
the anatomy is al
tered: one of her 
shadow-boxes, for 
example, contains a 
rounded torso with 
three hands (two on 
one wrist) that 
uncomfortably 
twist and curl in the tight space. 
As with her drawings, Fletcher 
uses bright, non-local color on the 
plaster forms.
Hebert also uses her surround
ings as subject matter in her work. 
Coming from a musical family 
(her father is the principal bas
soonist for the Metropolitan 
Opera), Hebert decided on musi
cal instruments as a theme for a 
series of serigraphs. She also 
works with architectural forms, 
among other subject matter. A 
series of four abstract photo
graphs that will be shown depict 
organic shadows against a more 
ordered, grid-like background. 
Some serigraphs she has recently 
produced depict buildings and 
series of windows. One in particu
lar, made using a photoreduction 
process, depicts a row of Bostonesque third-story rooftops that 
create a dynamic pattern in their 
repetition.
Its realism at the Forbes Gal
lery this week. The artists will 
host a closing reception Friday 
from 7-9 pm; all students and 
faculty are welcome to attend.

The long awaited Half Life al
bum is finally out. Its all new 
stuff (or at least stuff that hasnt 
been on vinyl before - some of the 
songs were on their cassette re
leases) that was recorded some
time this summer (I think). Hav
ing not yet listened to it, I cant 
tell you what it sounds like, but, 
:onsidering who was in the band 
when it was recorded, I suspect 
its a bit less metallic than Half 
Life sounds now, and closer to 
their I Got It Bad seven incher 
than their first EP.
This week is another fairly good 
one, concert-wise, and with a good 
bit more spread to it than the 
norm for this town. Tomorrow 
night, you can check out the Trio 
Bulgarka at Carnegie Hall, the 
Screaming Trees at the Sonic 
Temple, or the Cro-Mags at City 
Limits (explanations later). 
Thursday theres Miracle Legion 
Graffiti and White Zombie at 
the Sonic Temple, Friday theres 
the Cowboy Junkies at the South 
Bills Theatre and Manifesto at
Peeks concert schedule is unusually heavy

the Sonic Temple, and Saturday 
theres the Cynics at the Electric 
Banana and Alice Donut at the 
Sonic Temple. Sunday, Liof 
Munimula (aluminum foil back
wards, pronounced something like 
lee-off moo-nee-moo-la) will be 
at the Sonic Temple, and, finally, 
Monday brings Moe Tucker (from 
the Velvet Underground) and Half 
Japanese (from Columbia, Mary
land) to the Sonic Temple. Whew.
What all that means:
The Trio Bulgarka is that Bul
garian folk music that youve been 
hearing so much about. Its usu
ally just three women singing, its 
probably like nothingyouve heard 
before and it is worth knowing 
about, if not actually hearing. (A 
cheaper way to hear Bulgarian 
folk music is Le Mysterie De Voix 
Bulgares, two albums thatinclude 
a bunch of songs from a bunch of 
different Bulgarian womens 
choirs. The music on these al
bums is really spectacu
lar.)
The ScreamingTrees 
are from Seattle, and 
arent on Sub Pop, al
though they could be. 
They remind me more 
of the Seventies than 
any other band that didnt exist 
in the Seventies - their music has 
an almost lazy sound to it, almost 
psychedelic, except that every few 
minutes the guitars kick them
selves awake and spit out a few 
nasty licks before settling back 
down. (WARNING: If you are in a 
Greek organization, this is 63% of 
the column. You have to stop here. 
Dont tell me this is stupid - you 
proposed it.) Theyre more inter
esting than this description makes 
them sound, but Im stymied, so I 
guess youll just have to go see 
them. (The show also includes 
Thin White Line, and Futon as 
well.)
The Cro-Mags are the loudest 
Hare Krishnas youll ever meet. 
(Actually, only two of them are 
Hare Krishnas. The rest are just 
loud.) They were hardcore, but 
nobody calls it hardcore anymore, 
so I guess theyre metal. They are 
good, though, and their live shows
are pretty amazing. (They jump 
around a lot. So does everyone 
else in the place.) Im not sure 
how itll all be in the huge skating 
rink known as City Limits (be
sides loud, which everything at 
City Limits is). Come to think of 
it, it probably wont matter. 
(Destruction, an unabashed metal 
band, will be opening for the CroMags.)
So what do you go see? Well, 
there wont be any yuppies at the 
ScreamingTrees or the Cro-Mags, 
there arent any seats at City 
Limits, neither City Limits or the 
Sonic Temple look as nice inside 
as Carnegie Hall (the place Billy 
Bragg played a while ago), and 
the Trio Bulgarka doesnt have 
any electric guitars. (The Scream
ing Trees show is also the cheap
est, more so considering that there 
are three bands on the bill.) Make 
your own choice.
And thats just Wednesday.
(My picks will probably be the 
Screaming Trees, White Zombie, 
and an early bedtime. I dont know 
about Saturday.)

Greeks do use more than 63%

After his death, Victor Paskow (Brad Greenquist) warns Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) not to go where the dead walk, in Steven Kings new horror 
thriller Pet Sematary.
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Staffwriter
If you look at Stephen Kings 
past record of books being turned 
into movies, it is rather check
ered. Some of his movies have 
been smash hits, such as The 
Shining and Carrie, while others 
have done horribly, like Maxi
mum Overdrive. When you come 
to Kings new movie, Pet Sema
tary, its clear that it goes in the 
smash hit category.
The plot revolves around Dr. 
Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff), his 
wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) and 
their children Ellie and Gage, who 
move from the busy city of Chi
cago to a small town in Maine. 
Shortly after arriving, they meet 
their neighbor across the street 
(Jud Crandall, played by Fred 
Gwynne, Mr. Munster himself) 
and discover a mysterious trail in 
their backyard which leads into 
the woods.
Jud takes the entire family up 
the trail a few days later, which 
just happens to lead to  guess 
what? If you said a pet cemetery, 
then score two points. The ceme
tery, as Jud explains, is where all 
the kids in the town bury their 
family pets. Jud himself put his 
dog Spot there way back in the 
1920s. They leave the cemetery,
after looking around a little, and 
then the really strange things 
start to happen.
On Louiss first day of work as 
the head doctor of a university 
hospital, Victor Pascow (Brad 
Greenquist) is quickly carried in 
with a huge hole in his head. The 
doctor can, of course, do nothing 
for this kid who has most of his 
skull ripped off, and Paskow dies
 or does he? See the movie, 
because Im not going to ruin this 
part for you.
That night Louis has a dream 
where Pascow brings him to the 
pet cemetery and warns him not 
to cross a huge deadwood, no 
matter how how badly he wants 
to. Louis cant take the horror of 
the dream anymore, and violently 
wakes up.
Life then continues on its merry 
way for the Creed family, until 
Thanksgiving. While Rachel and 
the kids are away in Chicago vis
iting family relatives, the family 
cat dies. Jud and Louis know how 
much Ellie loved that cat, and so 
Jud decides to show Louis a neat 
little place, just beyond that deadwood which Louis was warned 
not to go past. Jud takes Louis to 
an ancient Indian burial ground, 
and tells Louis to bury his cat 
here  apparently the plot has 
special properties. It seems that
the burial ground can bring 
corpses back to life, which Louis 
finds out the next night. How
ever, there is one small catch. The 
newly risen cat isnt quite the 
same as it was before. It has, lets 
just say, a real bad attitude now. 
Louis Creed has now begun a 
deadly, terrifying exploration.
There are several factors which 
make Pet Sematary a good movie. 
First, and probably the biggest 
reason, is the fact that King wrote 
the screenplay. He has written 
several screenplays in the past, 
such as Creepshow and Silver Bul
let, but never before did King 
adapt a screenplay from one of his 
best-sellers. A big problem was
that key concepts and important 
parts which were found in the 
books were left out of the movies. 
With Pet Sematary, almost all the 
potent ideas which were in the 
book can be found in the movie. 
The result was a well-written 
screenplay which accomplished a 
lot.
Second, the movie was scary. 
There are some parts which make 
you jump out of your seat once in 
a while, but the last thirty min
utes are extremely tense. I had 
read the book already, so I knew 
what was going on and what was 
going to happen  and I was still 
scared. If you have never read the 
book before, you will probably be
terrified.
Finally, the directing was very 
good. Mary Lambert is a new
comer to the directing world, but 
she has quite a bit of talent. The 
problem with most horror movies 
is that the director is taking the 
approach of, Hey, lets make a 
horror movie, with blood and guts 
and make it really scary. While I 
was watching Pet Sematary I got 
the feeling that Lambert took the 
approach of, Hey, lets make a 
movie and follow all the normal 
guidelines and while were at it 
lets throw in some horror too. 
The result was a well made movie.
As for the acting, Fred Gwynne 
is pretty good in this movie. The
only problem I had with him; was 
that he sometimes seemed tc} lose 
that New England accent. Miko 
Hughes as 29-month-old Gage 
Creed is really good. Just remem
ber how hard it is to work with 
children in movies and you can 
appreciate his performance.!
Pet Sematary is one of Kings 
best movies to date. It is a !true 
horror story with a very climatic 
ending. King is definitely up there 
with M.R. James, Edgar Allan 
Poe, and H.P. Lovecraft, and! this 
movie does justice to his master
piece novel.
Pet Sematary opened this past 
Friday in Pittsburgh. Check local 
listings for venues and showtimes.

The movie Major League opens 
with newspaper clippings about 
the Cleveland Indians superim
posed on pictures of the city itself. 
The clippings, chosen from the 
last 40 years, start with the Indi
ans World Series victory of 1948 
and their 1954 American League 
Championship before showing the 
lowlights of the past 35 years, in 
which the Indians have not won a 
single championship and have 
rarely contended.
As the story begins in early
1989, the Indians owner has died 
and the team has been inherited 
by his former showgirl wife Ra
chel Phelps (Margaret Whitton). 
Phelps hates Cleveland and would 
like to move the team to Miami. 
The only way she can get out of 
her stadium lease in Cleveland is 
if the attendance falls low enough.
Towards this end, she decides 
to invite the worst has-beens and 
never-will-bes she can find to
zynP oaGG
spring training in order to create 
a team so bad that no one would 
want to watch them play.
The movie stars three of the 
players chosen to drive the team 
into the ground. Tom Berenger 
plays Jake Taylor, a 35-year-old 
catcher who, after bouncing 
around the Mexican Leagues for 
years, cant believe that he is being 
given another shot at the majors. 
Thinking that the person who calls 
to invite him to spring training is 
playing a practical joke, Taylor 
tells him At least you could have 
said you were with the Yankees.
Taylors battery mate is Rickie 
Wild Thing Vaughn (Charlie 
Sheen), a young pitcher with a 96 
mile-an-hour fastball who tells 
Taylor that the last league he 
played in was the California Penal 
League. Vaughn needs to make 
the team to avoid going back to 
prison.
Finally, there is veteran third 
baseman Roger Dorn (Corbin 
Bemsen). Dorn has found the easy 
life and would rather play out his
Gace Major League
last few years as a mediocre in
fielder on a losing team than dive 
for balls and risk permanent in
jury. Dorn is roughly the player 
one would expect to end up with if 
you took Arnie Becker (Bemsens 
LA. Law character) and made 
him trade in his suit and brief
case for a uniform and baseball 
glove.
All three actors give very enter
taining performances, as do 
Wesley Snipes as Willie Mays 
Hayes, a lighting fast outfielder 
who needs to learn that you can 
not beat out fly balls, Dennis 
Haysbert as Cuban first baseman 
Pedro Cerrano, who sets up an 
altar in his locker to pray for the 
ability to hit a curveball, and Bob 
Mr. Baseball Uecker as the 
Indians play-by-play man, Harry 
Doyle.
Uecker is one of three former 
major leaguers in the movie. 
Former Dodgers catcher Steve 
Yeager was a technical advisor 
for the film and played the Indi
ans batting coach, Duke Temple.
Pete Vuckovich, who won the 1982 
American League Cy Young 
Award with the Milwaukee Brew
ers, plays Vaughns nemesis, a 
Yankees slugging first baseman 
identified only as Haywood.
The presence of the three major 
leaguers, as well as a concerted 
effort on the part of Director David 
Ward to use actors with baseball 
talent, made Major League much 
more realistic than many base
ball movies. There were only one 
or two slow-motion shots, a ploy 
often used to hide the fact that 
few movie pitchers can throw 90 
mile-an-hour fastballs and even 
fewer batters can hit them.
The story as a whole is some
thing out of a baseball fantasy, 
but the individual scenes, both on 
and off the field, are believable 
and entertaining.
This movie is worth seeing if 
you are a baseball fan, especially 
a fan of the Indians.
Major League is playing at the 
Manor in Squirrel Hill and other 
theaters in the Pittsburgh area.

Pins over Pgh.its the 
Flying Karamazov Bros.
By STEPHANIE REEDY
Tartan Staffwriter
And now, the moment youve 
all been waiting for... The Flying 
Karamazov Brothers are coming 
to Pittsburgh! What are the Flying 
Karamazov Brothers, you ask? 
Theyre jugglers, musicians, 
comedians, daredevils, and allaround wacky entertainers.
You are personally invited to 
attend a night of fun and sur
prises at 8 pm at the Benedum 
Center this Wednesday, April 
26th. Bring anything smaller than 
a breadbox weighing less than 
ten pounds with you for The 
Champ to juggle. The audience 
gets to choose the object to be 
juggled duringThe Gamble part 
of the program.
In the past, challenges havebeen such items as pizzas, skate
boards, and Slinkys, so be imagi
native! If The Champ success
fully juggles your object within 
three tries, he gets a standing 
ovation. If he fails, a pie in the 
face.
Not only do they juggle the 
unjuggle-able, the Flying Kar
amazovs create dazzling displays 
with balls and ten-pins. Theyre 
pins when they fly, clubs when 
they hit you, says one Flying 
Karamazov.
The Karamazovs latest show 
follows their hits Juggle and

in various places around the

Hedda Gabler zyGGP Pkrbt rz tke Tybc
By ROBERT CUCUZZA
Tartan Senior Prod. Asst.
Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler is 
an intricately woven tale of one 
womans descent into suicidal 
dissatisfaction. Its plot is filled 
with tension and triangular rela
tionships that create incredible 
conflict between the characters. 
Unfortunately, the Pittsburgh 
Public Theaters production of 
Hedda Gabler misses the mark.
The power of this play lies in 
the tightness of the relationships 
between Hedda and her cohorts. 
For the play to achieve its inher
ent strength, strong and passion
ate performances are required.
Lee Sankowich has given the 
play a very traditional and al
most excruciatingly conservative 
direction. There seems to be no 
concept upon which the text and 
actors can work. This lack of 
concept has taken some of the 
bite out of the piece.
The acting is disjointed and, as 
I have noticed in recent Public 
productions, the performers are 
often miscast. Michael J. Hume is 
insipid as George Tesman. He is a 
whirlwind of monotony which, 
although appropriate at times, 
becomes very tiring. His one-di
mensional portrayal of the char
acter lacks the obsession and 
emotion that is required to create 
the immense tension between 
Tesman and Hedda.
William Rhys is miscast as 
Judge Brack. His characteriza
tion is solid, but he is too young 
for the role. I found it hard to 
believe that his relationship with 
Hedda had come from years of 
experience and knowledge.
As Eilert Lovborg, Jim Abele is 
intense, but he restrains the 
power of the character by making 
him too introverted. Catherine 
Butterfield gives a solid perform
ance as Thea Elvstead, but her 
heavy makeup and frazzled hair 
make her look like a character out 
of The Beggars Opera.
Fortunately, this production is 
saved by the performance of He
lena Ruoti as Hedda Gabler. She 
expertly walks a tightrope be
tween witty cynicism and 
chillingly blunt discontent as she 
glides across the stage, playfully 
stalking her prey with coy mali
ciousness. The adaptation used 
by the Public was written with 
Ruoti in mind, and she has made 
the most of it.
Corrine Jackars adaptation is 
refreshing. It substitutes contem
porary language and rhythms for 
the archaic colloquiums of the late 
nineteenth century. It makes the 
play easier to comprehend while 
keeping Ibsens spirit intact.
The set, designed by Harry 
Feiner, is inconsistent with the 
piece. Its Greek columns and 
purple curtains leading to godknows-where are ineffective and

Helena Ruoti Is the sole redeemer of the Publics current production of 
Henrik Ibsens Hedda Gabler.
detract from the ornate Victorian 
style of the play. Much of the 
tension in the first scene between 
Hedda and Lovborg is lost be
cause the Judge and Tesman, 
supposedly in close proximity, are 
stuffed halfway behind a curtain 
in one of the corners. The effec
tiveness of the final tableau is 
hampered due to the restricting 
design.
I recommend going, though, 
simply because the play is excel
lent. The flaws in the production 
do not entirely detract from the 
play, they just make it difficult to 
enjoy it to the fullest.
Hedda Gabler runs through 
May 14 at the Pittsburgh Public 
Theater. Performances are Tues
day through Saturday at 8 pm 
and Sundays at 2 pm and 7 pm. 
Half price tickets are available to 
students half an hour before cur
tain. Call the Public Box Office at 
321-9800 for more information,
the Flying Karamazovs combine 
music, comedy, and juggling with 
todays advanced technologies. 
The show will use computers, 
synthesizers, and specially de
signed radio-controlled props to 
create one of the most technologi
cally advanced productions in the 
Karamazovs 14 year history.
The Flying Karamazov Broth
ers appeared in the 1985 feature 
film Jewel of the Nile, and their 
Obie Award-winning Off-Broad
way run has won them a dedi
cated following. No matter what 
they dothrow pies, juggle pins, 
or crack jokes  the Flying Kar

The effort to understand is what produces 
writing, the tool and expression through which au

reaches full enlightenment, tin* inscrutable charac

the centuries will suffocate in a rarified atmosphere 
of perfect knowledge. Perhaps there is a fatality in 
seeing things too well. In their struggle to make sense

My Parents Are Moving From Our Hometown
In a purple dusk my parents and I 
walk along a rushing creek 
to a lake where water slides under ice, 
dark, no bubbles. Ten years
ago I would have run down 
the rough beach, tested the ice. 
So I stoop, watch a pale crack 
grow, the rock skipping away
if I never walk here again, this place 
will stay just the samethe couple 
arm in arm watch their grown 
child kneel by the ice again.

You sit behind the man and his new lover;
the canoe escapes through the black water. You are afraid
to panic, the girl will turn, capsizing the boat, leaving you
to flounder through the darkness unable to know directions.
It is not a fear of lost buoyancy which calms you,
but of something much more treacherous.
In the October water the life preserver
and laws of nature will float you safely
on your backyou see the constellations, make out
the little bear and Orion's belt. Did you think finding
the north star would lead you to shore, or that the shock
of the icy water would somehow change everything?

It is enough to know the constellations, a form of comfort 
as you stare up from the dock, making your way 
up the thick hill to the house. You think of how foolish 
it is to take the boat out at night, at this time of year.
If the boat had turned into the lake, dumping you three out, 
who would have been saved?

Have mercy upon us, most merciful Father: 
In your compassion forgive us our sins, 
known and unknown, things done and left undone.
In an air full of stone-dust and the dust of 
old oak, I felt more and more Ill-at-ease. The button 
had torn loose and was now In my hand. I hid It 
among the hymnals. The puddle of water near my 
feet licked at itself. I looked up at the priest as he 
held high the transparent water. I was suddenly 
transfixed. There, right there, stretched out across 
the altar was my shadowparka, book bag, sneak
ers, and all. I looked around furtively to see if 
anyone else had noticed, for I was in no position th 
give myself away; then I tried, without attracting any 
attention, to get it to look at me.
Damn It! Why hadnt I gone down 86th
Street?
I beckoned to it. Pst! But it remained there, 
on the altar. It was seated up-right now, showing a 
lack of petulance, provocatively swinging its sneakered feet.'
Come here," I whispered. It ignored me. It 
3 later and later. Listen, I said, We'll go 
jignow. Well make snow forts, and 
ses with snowballs. I didn't know
fFof my life had made you so bored,: -! priest continued: The gifts of God for 
the people of God.",,. _ _ *
: People were lining up at the altar rail, 
kneeling, hands outstretched, waiting, supplicating.
I joined them so I could get closer to it. Maybe I 
would get a chance to grab it, the little bastardl
The hell with you! Who needs you 
anyway!
I was so late. I'd never finish the ma!1' 
homework-on time. Imagine trying to explain to Mrs. 
Lirtzman, Well, you see, Mrs. Urtzman, I couldn't 
do my math because my, um, shadow ran Stud 
from me in a church last night." Or, Sorry, MofffP^' 
would have called, but, you see, first I lost my bus 
pass, then I lost my shadow...
God damn you, come down here, or Ill 
blow every candle; Ill dissolve all light!
But neither threats, nor angels, nor princi
palities could move him and dispel my gloom.
The priest stood before me.
.. .The bread of Heaven." I took the Host, 
the small wafer stuck to the roof of my mouth.
Then my shadow slowly came down from 
the altar. It walked towards me, caught between a 
cross-mesh of lights. It was limping. It did not kneel 
beside me, nor before me, nor behind me.
It entered me.
The Host in my mouth dissolved. But the 
gesture behind it wouid not.

I should never have taken that route.
Why hadnt I gone down 86th Street? It had been 
snowing all day, and even though the snow was, 
as usual, white, 88th Street was dark. Great flakes 
blew and grew on knee high mountains.
86th Street would have been shovelled, 
or, at least, trampled. I had no gloves, no hat; my 
sneakers were soaked; the bottoms of my pants 
were now part of the snow, the book bag on my 
back bearing me back. I seemed to be making 
almost no headway. Damn! Why did I have to lose 
my bus pass again?
Soon, I found myself, like an ark adrift, 
washed by guilt (unspecified) up to the gates of the 
church. It was the wind that brought me snow
footed through those old Iron gates up to the oak 
doors arched by ice-bearded white-haired gro
tesques little saints, who watch over the church gar
denthe hedge rose, the briar rose and the 
mystic rose of the world on its mystical stem. Up 
against myself, I went in.
The church lay in a furry cocoon of its own 
light, moth soft, filtered through stained stories. A 
Eucharist was being celebrated, half imagined (yet 
wholly real). Acolytes robed in beatitudes (and plati
tudes) went jubilantly up the aisles like vested 
insects. Unseen censors wove in and out of molted 
transepts. A congregation sat wraithlike, in the 
narrowness of troubles, as if their pale brows were 
bound with laurel from laureled dead, a winter storm 
of dead men blossoming.
I sat down, settled into the worn purple 
cushion. The ice scratching my pants began to melt 
and dissolve. I played with a loose velvet-covered 
button on the pew cushion.
The priest, taken with the majesty of his life, 
ascended to the pulpit. Now everything would be 
praised; the deeds, the thoughts, the issues defend
ed that need never have been raised.
He descended to the altar and became 
absorbed In the preparations. (Soon, I would slip out 
and get home.)
Ascribe to the Lord the honor due his
Name;
bring offerings and come into His courts."
The Peace of the Lord be always with you." 
And also with you.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Lift up your hearts.
We lift them up to the Lord."
I closed my eyes and reminded myself that I 
was just a boy on his way home from school who 
had come In to warm up and had suffered from a 
general loss of consciousness.

ship mounted in a bottle.
He carried the model downstairs cradled in his palm and 
went back outside without considering if Simon or Lynn saw him or 
if they cared.
Shadows from the patio furniture were stretched across the 
ground. North ended up sitting on the shore of Willow Walk Pond. 
He listened to lawn mowers cut lawns he could not see. He listened 
to the drone of cars driving down his street and waited for the bugs 
to start biting and the air to cool. North gave the boat a perfunctory 
examination. The PT109 had been a torpedo boat with four torpedo 
launchers on the sides and four machine gun mounts. It was known 
for its speed. North had strung the safety cables that ran the main 
deck of the boat with fishing line. It gave the model an intricate and 
fragile look. The real PT109 had been cut in half by a Japanese 
destroyer.
North worried that Christopher Collins might join him, but 
he did not want to go back inside. He began to think about the ark 
again, about the earth covered with water. Gently, he put the model 
down on the surface of the pond. It fell to its side and floated to the 
shore as if it were afraid to go out any further. North straightened up. 
He nudged the model out into the pond with the toe of his work boot 
until it was convinced to move away from the shore.
North sat down again on the gravel and watched the model 
bob convulsively. He imagined watching television in his newlycompleted tool shed.
He heard Christopher Collins say, North, man, let me 
watch the tube with you.
North asked, But arent you working on something in your
yard?
No, Collins said happily. I dont like it. Im abandoning 
the project.
Collins gestured for North to come outside to get a look at 
exactly what he was abandoning. North walked outside and saw a 
gigantic wooden ship docked in Collins yard. Two giraffes were 
sticking out from the top of the craft. The completed ship and the 
presence of the giraffes filled North with an intense and disturbing 
fear. He assumed the rest of the ship was loaded with animals.
North said, Hey Collins, Ill go if you wont. But Chris
topher Collins had disappeared into the tool shed.
North started to run across his lawn. Water began seeping up 
from the ground. It was soon up to his knees. He tried to keep his 
eyes trained on the boat. He saw Lynn and Simon on the deck of the 
ship attempting to saddle the giraffes, one of which was munching , 
calmly on a tree in Norths yard. The other was drinking from the 
rising water. ' yA sharp breeze ended Norths daydream. His vision res-! 
solved itself, and he once again saw his dark green plastic boat. The 
PT109, still turned on its side, had floated out of reach. The sun had 
almost completely set and dusk clothed everything iji grey. Fora 
few minutes. North did not move from his position, then he turne# 
around so he could spot his solidifying foundation in the yard. "the. 
willow trees branches tangled in the wind.
Another cold breeze blew over him. It transported a jiihtjpfj?. 
the ponds stagnation like a light perfume. He could see the tirpb&5' 
of Collins stage jutting up from his back yard. They' came i.nt$. 
forboding relief against the darkening sky.
One drop, then another hit Norths face. He looked;up to se^' 
an army of dark grey clouds streaming overhead. Soon the. tain fejjl. 
steadily. It drenched Norths clothes and made his skin feel cold and 
rubbery.
The pond registered the shower in sibilance. Cold rivers, 
found their way into Norths shoes. They chilled the arches of his 
feet and trickled between his toes. Everywhere clothes were pasted 
to his body.
North's feet crunched on the rocky shore when he stood up. 
He felt his shin peel away from his back and a wintry stream run 
down his spine and into his pants.
The PT 109 was persuaded to turn one way, then another, by 
the downpour. It appeared to be holding together but was becoming 
sluggish. Though it was never meant to float. North had always 
thought that it would and was disappointed by its imbalance. His 
tool shed would be better.
North remembered the Twenty-Fifth Psalm. He folded his 
hands in front of him, bowed his head, and watched the pond water 
creep up to his toes.

over with? Ivory was what they made the 
keys on my grandmothers piano out of.
Yeah, thats bad, North said.
The oceans are polluted. The air 
is polluted. The greenhouse effect is 
burning us alive...
North stretched his legs out in 
front of him. reached his arms toward the 
sky, and yawned. Maybe you should 
send some of those people money.
No, North, man, listen. I think 
its too late. Everythings too fucked up in the world. Christopher 
inhaled. I think the world is coming to an end. Thats why Im 
building an ark.
Come on.
His neighbors expression was so serious that it bothered 
North. His first impulse had been to dart off like a rabbit, to get back 
to his own humble and familiar project. But if he left abruptly, he 
would look foolish, especially if Christopher was only joking about 
the ark.
The men fell into silence. Collins stared into the water, 
maybe watching fish twist in the murky shallowness near the shore. 
North stared into the sky. A flight path went over Willow Walk and 
at fixed intervals, planes retraced the same streak overhead. It made 
a weird clock that North often found himself trying to read.
Finally, Collins asked, What do you think? Im crazy or
what?"
North brought himself to look into his neighbors eyes, a 
smile cracking his face.
What will you do if the world doesnt end? J mean, strictly 
speaking, after the Flood, God promised he wouldn't do anything 
like that ever again.
God doesnt have to do anything this time, man. Its going 
to be us. Were doing it to ourselves.
Well, what good will an ark be if the world blows up?
"I wont care about it if the world blows up."
North forced a laugh. 1 see. Well what are you going to.do 
if these foundations end up saving the world?"
Collins pursed his lips together and thought for view sec
onds. Then, with a faint shrug of his shoulders, said, 'i'll sell it>" 
North stood up and began to walk up his lawn.
"Back to work," he said, although he had done ajl he could 
that day.
See ya later, he heard Christopher say listlessly.
North decided to check his mail. When he reached iiiio the 
cool darkness of his mailbox, he felt a Soil, go.opy.mass. Someone ; 
had filled his mailbox with ripp.edrtijr canai Is;and-. 
removed the violation carefully and let the mess fall into the 
stagnant stream that hugged the curb.
He felt the smoothness of paper and extracted his mail. At 
least the mail was still there. Among catalogs, the water and Visa 
bills, and a letter from his stock broker, there was an envelope which 
declared, Inside is your first real chance to tell the National Rifle 
Association to go to hell, in bold black letters.
It was the very sort of mail Collins had been talking about, 
an indication of Armageddon. North tore into the letter while he 
walked back up his driveway. They wanted as much as North could 
give, up to 100 tax-deductible dollars or more, to help outlaw 
handguns and fight the NRA. He deposited the letter in a garbage 
can in his garage along with the letter from his stock broker. The last 
thing North heard before entering his house was Collinss rotary 
saw buzzing through timbers.
His wife and son were in the family room sitting next to each 
other in the middle of the couch. Both had red hair, Lynns short, 
Simons long, and the backs of their necks were freckled. Simons 
freckles were large, like pieces of confetti while Lynns were small 
and resembled a remote constellation. The two were great friends 
which. North supposed, was an odd enough thing for an adolescent 
boy and his mother to be. He guessed he should be grateful or 
amazed at this, but he was not.
Wheres the game?" North asked aloud, purposely grin
ning as he diverted their attention from a black and while movie. 
Anything for dinner?"
He sat down in a huge leather chair next to the couch and 
tapped his fingers on the arms waiting for a reply. Lynn regarded
notice his presence.
Why dont you make something for 
yourself? Lynn suggested.
I guess the answer is no, North 
said.
The answer is no only if you do not 
want to make anything for yourself. 
Sinking deeper into the plaid uphol
stery of the couch, Lynn fixed her at
tention back on the movie.
I dont want to make anything for 
myself because Ive been working outside all day. What have you 
done besides watch television, Lynn?
North, I dont want to hear it, okay? Ill make you a 
sandwich when the movie is over.
No, thanks. North said sharply and headed for the kitchen.
His face felt tight with dried sweat, and he could smell the 
outdoor musk of his skin, a mixture of sweat and grass. As he 
reached into the refrigerator for a Dos Equis, Simon sauntered into 
the kitchen.
North leaned back on the counter and let the beer rush into 
his mouth. He stared at his sons thin, curving back with slight 
disgust. He wanted Simon to ask what he was building in the back 
yard.
Simon began to make a bologna and crushed Doritos sand
wich. The process involved carefully layering Doritos on top of a 
couple slices of bologna, almost as if he were putting shingles on a 
roof, and then, after adding the top slice of bread, crushing the 
sandwich down to half its original width.
. : Northhad begun.U).survey, the.kitchen floor to see if he had
tracked any cfirt in. He noticed some Cattail seeds and fibers stuck to 
his knuckles. He put his beer down in one side of the sink and rubbed 
his hand clean under the faucet. North dabbed his fingers dry with 
a paper towel and resumed staring at Simon.
Simon was scooping coffee grinds into a filter although he 
did not driak cpffee. It was for Lynn. The boy stopped, turned to his 
father; and-.settlpd his gaze on Norths chest.
"What are you looking at? Simon asked patiently. He 
grabbed Uie.coft'ccpot and reached at an angle behind North to fill 
it with water.
Your, uh, friends, left you a present in the mailbox. I had to 
clean it up, North said.
At first Simon looked confused, then he understood.
God, he said. Simon filled the coffee machine with water, 
flicked the red light on, and left as Lynn came into the kitchen.
. What do you want ? she asked North. I could make you 
Vpizza.
Lynn opened up the ice box and began to rummage 
among the packages.
Just forget it, Lynn, North said sourly.
Look, North, if you want me to make you something now, 
I will, but 1 am not your maid.
Are you ever going to stop saying that?
Lynn slammed the freezer door shut. Then she pointed at 
North accusingly.
I tried, North, she said. I tried.
North did not know what to do then. He did not want to sit 
in the family room with Lynn and Simon. He guessed he would have 
to go back outside, but first, he wanted to go upstairs.
After North had assembled the PT109, he had checked out 
all three books about John F. Kennedy and the PTI09 from the 
childrens library. It had been a lifelong fantasy of his to be 
marooned on a remote island in the Pacific with nothing to do all day 
except swim from island to island and carve desperate S.O.S. 
messages in coconuts. The true test of a man came when he was set 
adrill with nothing to depend on but himself, where everything was 
as unsure and ever-changing as the waves that rippled where land 
should be.
The house settled in a dull creak as he walked quietly across 
the bedroom. He could smell the faint alcoholic scent of the facial 
cream Lynn used. North opened the top drawer of his dresser where 
he kept his collar points, cuff links, class rings, loose change, 
handkerchiefs, and various other things. He reached in behind his 
pile of assorted effects and let his fingers find what he wanted to see. 
Then he lifted it out of the drawerihe PTI09. It had been twenty 
years since he had assembled it. North had always planned to get ihe

My Father Works with the Retards
He calls it Coconut College and speeds 
by them on their benches, waving. 
"That one in the blue cap is Jim," 
he'd say, "he tried
to eat his shirt in my office last week. 
Had it halfway down his throat 
and started this awful, mute cry."
When the green bus 
parked right next to us at McDonald's 
he laughed. "Here come the looney 
tunes." But he jumped right out to hug 
the buck-toothed Susan.
She just kept grunting and smiling 
into his checkerboard hunting jacket.
That Jim with the hat slid 
into the booth,
his voice sounding like something 
between a yawn and gagging.
"She's pretty, John, is she yours?"
He petted my hair like a business 
woman brushes lint from her shoulder.
My father tests their hearing.
He gives them M ik M's 
when they tell him which ear 
the beep comes from. Susan 
holds tight to a fistful of colored 
candy as my father adjusts 
her hearing aidsbeige plastic 
echo speakers, as she calls 
them. "Hold your beautiful 
curls back," he tells her, "so 
I can see those pretty little ears."
I could say she beams 
from ear to echoing ear 
with the compliment, beautiful 
curls, pretty little ears, but 
instead she takes 
his word into her hands, lets 
them stick there leaving sugary 
colored dots.

North Peterson 
slicked a hand trowel across the 
surface of the freshly poured cement in neat half 
moon strokes while he tried to remember the TwentyFifth Psalm. Father Dolan had used the text as an opening 
prayer in Mass that day. North had not been paying attention, 
but his ears had picked up on the words, Show me your mercy, 
for I am wretched and alone.* He was laying the foundation for a 
tool shed underneath the willow tree in his back yard. Not that he 
needed one North had never built anything before except a plas
tic model of the P T 1 09 when he was a child. The model 
had been a Christmas present from his mother when he was 
twelve. After three feverish days of sitting on a stool in 
front of his fathers work bench, he had finished assem
bling it. North waited an agonizing fifteen minutes 
for the last pieces, safety rails on the main deck, to dry.
Then he ran upstairs to show his mother the dream realized. He thought she had given him the model because 
she had want ed it built. His mother was on the phone.
North tugged at her elbow with his other hand 
coddling the invention. Mom, Do you 
want to see my model? he asked.
She did not answer.
Mom. took. North whined, holding the model up 
carefully with both hands, thinking that once she saw it, he\ 
would capture her attention. In Norths mind, his mother had 
been eagerly awaiting the models completion.
Yes, hang on Mary Lou, his mother said into the' 
phone. She looked down at North. Her hair was pulled back in 
a bun. It made her face look severe and elderly.
She said, Im on the phone. Now, please... Her gritty, 
smoke-eroded voice stabbed him.
When the foundation was as smooth as he could make it. 
North rinsed out his new wheel barrow with a garden hose. His 
neighbor, Christopher Collins, was also building something in 
his yard next door. North could not immediately identify what 
he was working on, but from the amount of timber in his back 
yard. North figured Collins had to be building something at least 
ten times as big as his tool shed.
A few minutes later. North was sitting near the gravelly 
shore of Willow Walk Pond having a beer with Collins. Mini
scule waves troubled the ponds surface, and a few of the first 
leaves of fall were collecting near its shore and drainage areas. 
Both the Peterson and the Collins property met with the pond, 
and the men sat on either side of the invisible line that divided 
their yards.
So dont keep me in suspense, Collins, North said 
after taking a greedy sip of his beer. What are you building 
now?
Christopher Collins had put up a wooden fence separat
ing their lots a few years before. He had also added a room onto 
his house, converted his garage into living space, redirected his 
driveway, and had built a sun deck with a glass door that 
required blasting a hole in his kitchen wall. Collins tool shed 
had been around for quite some time, and North could only 
predict that his would be far inferior to it.
I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise, Collins said with 
a sly grin.
Well, Ill tell you what Im building, North offered. 
"A tool shed. Dont have a heart attack.
Collins squinted and looked at North, Why would I?
Because Ive never built anything before.
Oh, Collins said vaguely. He wore a pair of thick gar
dening gloves and a light blue knitted cap although the day had 
not been cold.
I told you. Now you tell me.
Im building a boat, Christopher said, staring into the
water.
A boat? Is that what all this is? North looked over his 
shoulder at the jumble of timber that littered his neighbors back 
yard.
Yeah, Im building the stage right now to hold the
ship.
North tried to picture a boat in Collins yard and briefly 
wondered what the Willow Walk Homeowners Association 
would have to say about it.
There isnt a place to sail a boat around here, North 
said. "Especially a big one.
Christopher finished his beer and placed the empty can 
carefully at his side.
Did you check your mail yesterday? Collins asked.
No. I havent gotten it yet.
Man, Christopher continued, yesterday I received 
letters from the World Wildlife Foundation, the Save Chesap
eake Bay Foundation, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
Yeah, so everyone wants your money, North said.
No, its not that. I would give these people money if it 
would help. Collins paused, then said, Hundreds, literally 
hundreds of these foundations write to me. I keep them on file 
in the house. Did you know, for example, that the elephant 
population has been cut in half in the past ten years? Some 
people think they have less than a decade left on this planet. 
Collins picked up a rock and tossed it into the pond. The rock 
splashed into the water and sent hypnotic waves out across the 
surface. These are elephants, man, those stupid grey things that 
take the big dumps at the zoo, some of the largest animals on 
earthand theyre getting killed off. Do you know for what?
Ivory, North guessed.
Yes, Christopher said. But can you believe that?
