Big Chance For Ugliest ManUMOC Will Receive Loving Cup, Dollar Back
Will Announce 
Winner At King 
Of Hearts Ball
After extensive investigation, 
Pinkerton detectives hired by the 
school have determined the source 
of, and reason for, the rash of 
UMOC signs about campus.
Here are the facts in brief. 
UMOC stands for Ugly Man On 
Campus. A contest is under way 
to find this person, and at the same 
time collect money for Campus 
Chest. The contest will be oper
ated as follows:
Candidates who wish to enter 
should deposit a picture (at least 
5x7), and one dollar in an envelope 
addressed to APO, Box 282.
Voting Regulations 
Each candidate will, without 
charge, be supplied with a milk 
bottle to accompany his picture. 
Both will be placed in Skibo for 
one hour each day from March 25 
to April 1.

Orchids
It has not been stated whether 
or not faculty members are eligible 
to run, but popular sentiment in
dicates that they should not, in or
der not to discourage interested 
students who would fear the in
creased competition.
Credit is due to Mr. Joseph O. 
Pecenka, who has allowed his 
photograph to be placed on pub
licity posters about campus. 
Orchids to you, Joe.
The accompanying cut depicts 
Edward Everett Mephistopheles,

Will Speak At CIT
Logical Positivist To Present
Series Of Talks, March 25-27
Dr. Herbert Feigl, professor of philosophy at the University of 
Minnesota and a leading exponent of logical positivism, will give a 
series of lectures on The Meaning of the Scientific Method for the 
faculty and students of CIT, beginning March 25 on the Carnegie
ccvvn&cpazs
VOL. 45No. 21 CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY TUES., MAR. 18, 1952
campus.
Born and educated in Vienna, 
Dr. Feigl was associated with 
Carnap and others in the Vienna 
school of logical positivism. Since 
his arrival in America, he has 
been a lecturer at many universi
ties, including Columbia, Iowa, 
and California.
(Logical positivism is that 
branch of phi
losophy which 
adv a nces the 
theory that 
only 'those 
concepts of 
philosophy 
which can be 
defined opera
tionally, or can 
be proved em
pirically and 
thus used in 
a p p lication to 
the various sciences have real 
meaning for the philosopher or 
scientist. Thus, such studies as 
metaphysics are pushel into an ob
scure corner.)
Feigl worked with Professor 
Bridgeman at Harvard on the logFeigl
ical foundation of physics under 
an International Rockefeller re
search fellowship. He was award
ed a Guggenheim Memorial Foun
dation fellowship for research in 
the methodological foundations of 
psychology.
Dr. Feigl serves as a member of 
the board of trustees of the Insti
tute for the Unity of Science and 
as an editorial member of The

Library Plagued By Freshman 
Vandalism Of Atlasses, Books
Pages Torn Out And Returned After Use;
Reserve Book Problem Crops Up Again
Those arent childrens crayon books the freshmen are coloring 
..its their SocRel assignment! And as a consequence the CIT 
library has found their recurring problem of book-mutilation crop
ping up stronger than ever. ?
Of equal concern is the problem
of reserve books: while the library 
must keep the books available for 
student use in the library, many 
students have pressing personal 
reasons for taking the books home 
earlier in the day.
Some freshmen, so say the li
brarians, find it more convenient 
to take reference maps home for 
the completion of the assignment. 
The big trouble is that the maps 
happen to be in irreplaceable at
lases which cant leave the library.
Map Thieves 
Some freshmen solve the prob
lem effectivelythey just tear out 
the maps and take them home.
But evidently there is some hon
or among thieves, for often the
Students Recital 
Scheduled Tonight 
In Exhibition Hall
Four students of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology music de
partment will give a recital to
night at 8:15 p.m. in the College 
of Fine Arts Exhibition Hall.
Saralee Eisner, pianist, will 
play Bachs Prelude and Fugue in 
F Minor, and Brahms Varia
tions on a Theme by Handel, Op. 
24.
Accompanied on the piano by 
Dolores DiLorenzo (an instructor 
in music at Tech), Lily Furia, so
prano, will sing three numbers 
by Purcell and four by Schubert, 
including Wanderers Nachlied 
and Rastlose Liebe."
To close the program, Martha 
Noyes, cellist, and George Walter, 
pianist, will play Boellmanns 
Sonata for Piano and Cello.
Fifth Place
CIT libraries rank fifth in 
the nation in the amount of 
money spent per student ac
cording to a recent survey. 
The only schools outspending 
Carnegie are two exclusive 
Eastern girls colleges, plus 
Princeton and Dartmouth.
missing maps are later found lying 
loose in the mutilated books.
Both the library and the social 
relations department are a little 
uncertain of the action to be taken 
against anyone discovered mutilat
ing the books, but they agree that 
it wont be pleasant.
Voigt Comments
Commenting on the reserve book 
situation, Professor M. J. Voigt, 
head of the library department, 
observed that students should ex
pect to do a large part of their 
studying on the campus. If there 
are really extenuating circum
stances requiring the student to 
leave campus before 3:30 (when 
reserve books can be taken out 
overnight) exceptions can be 
made."
Professor Voight pointed out 
that libraries at Carnegie are more 
lenient than those at most other 
colleges with respect to reserve 
books. In many schools, reserve 
books cannot be withdrawn from 
the library at all.
Blood Drive
On Friday, March 28, the 
Red Cross Bloodmobile will 
again visit the CIT Campus. 
Sponsored by the Council of 
Fraternity Presidents, the 
drive will be conducted 
through the fraternities, and in 
Skibo.

Brave New World
Maybe its necessary but it seems a shame. That is, all 
those restrictions surrounding campaign programs for King 
of Hearts. It makes one a little nostalgic for the good old 
days when, so they say, a college campaign had all the flavor 
and surprises of a combined carnival and miniature war.
But alas, in the name of order the school has regimented and 
standardized eampaigns so that each is likely to be a copy of every 
other.
Posters can't be put up before a certain day; they must 
be a certain size, with a maximum number allowed for each 
candidate, and each must be approved by the administration.
Time was when some enterprising fr-aternity might have 
brought a live gorilla or Clark Gable on campus, but now all 
such novel twists have been consigned to the limbo of wistful 
bull-sessions as we read that every candidate shall be an 
undergraduate day student at CIT. Some groups are going 
to have a tough time building a campaign around what they 
have to work with. They cant even use any animals or dan
gerous instruments or vehicles to take the voters minds off 
their candidates lack of other qualifications.
And again, in another day and age we could have expected 
to see pitched battles and frantic maneuvers as groups of virile 
young American manhood vied for space before Morewood Gar
dens or quarreled with the bustling Skibo waiters about hanging 
a 25' by 25' poster from every rafter. But now each entry is as
signed specific times for quiet little shenanegans at Skibo and 
Morewood and every rafter in Skibo has been designated by num
ber with the numbers distributed on, no doubt, a just and equit
able basis.
What a pity! That each must be reduced to the norm, 
that each must follow the pattern or be disqualified. But such 
are the attendant evils of progress and order. (For further 
moralizing on the same theme see Huxleys Brave New 
World.)

Chalk One Up
Nobody seems very happy over those colored maps the 
Soc-Rel department has been assigning fledging engineers 
~-both freshmen crayon-wielders and the librarians whose 
atlases have been mutilated by errant seekers after knowl
edge are grumbling, though for different reasons. (See story 
on page 1.)
But a recent poll by the New York Times indicates that 
maybe an elementary course in the geographic relations of 
countries is worthwhile after all. For the poll shows that 
what most college students dont know about geography 
would fill several university libraries. The paper gave a geo
graphy test to about 5,000 students in 42 colleges with some 
startling results.
For example, when asked to name the countries border
ing Yugoslavia, some students named Belgium, Egypt, Man
churia, Portugal, and even Canada. Only two percent could 
closely estimate Canadas population. Less than half the stu
dents could approximate the United States population: many 
though it was 500 million or more while some placed it 
in the billions. (The 1950) census estimated of the US popu
lation was about 152 million.) Only five per cent of the stu
dents polled could name the states bordering on the Atlan
tic coast, with many states as far inland as Mississippi named.
The study indicated that less than five per cent of the 
nations college students take even one geography course 
during their college careers.
It seems reasonable to require individuals who are ex
pected to understand and participate in the affairs of the 
world to have a good background in the simple physical 
relationships of different lands and peoples. Chalk one up 
for Carnegies freshman social relations courses for recog
nizing a problem of fundamental importance.

Letters to the Editor
No Spirit School's Fault"; 
Thistle Editor Stands Firm
Editor, the Tartan:
For a long time the Tartan and 
Student Council have cried for 
increased school spirit. The stu
dents have been thoroughly crit
icized for their lack of interest 
and general listless attitude. But I 
have often wondered whether it 
is the fault of the students en
tirely. It is becoming more and 
more evident that a prime cause 
for poor spirit is administration 
attitude.
Is the school really interested in 
a healthy student spirit? Or is its 
first love a good name to the gen
eral public, often at the expense 
of those who attend here?
Doesnt student morale count 
for something? Or have most of us 
become so dulled to anything but 
engineering that we will take any
thing as long as our slide rules 
are working well. I dont think 
so. I hope not.
But if morale is important:
Do the frequent power failures 
in the dorms endear the school 
to the student?
Does the official attitude toward 
fraternity drinking help publicity 
more than it hurts morale?
Does the actual condition of 
the dorms, especially the barracks, 
improve things?
Is Carnegie getting desired good 
publicity from its graduates?
Why cant Dorm Council vote 
money for beer? Where does Dorm 
Council get its funds?
Couldnt these things have an 
effect on the lack of spirit? The 
official attitude is fast infecting 
the student, who does not even 
have good publicity to gain.
So lets look to the school while 
crying for spirit. Nothing can 
grow in a vacuum.
Yours truly,
James E. Christopher.
Dear Mr. West.
It is not my purpose to deny 
the opinion, as such, printed in 
this past weeks Tartan. You are 
certainly entitled to it. I am deep
ly concerned, however, when you 
withdraw from the realm of hon
est opinion to that of simple mis
statement of factor might I call 
it opinion without foundation? My 
knowledge of the inner workings 
of the Tartan and Scot is negligi
ble; I therefore direct my atten
tion to that publication with which 
I am well acquainted, namely, 
the Thistle.
The statement has been made 
that the Thistle is in a rut. No ex
planation is given as to just what 
this rut is. Assuming rut to 
mean a fixed or established mode 
or procedure, what facts and rea
soning have led you to this con
clusion? What undercover inves
tigation has been going on to di
vulge our rutty secrets?
We believe the annual in con
tent should reflect as much as pos
sible the year at Techthe sen
iors, sports, Spring Carnival and 
Homecoming, fraternities and 
sororities, and activities. If this is 
being rutty, Vive ia rut. Be
yond this, we are sure we have 
risen above the ruttiness of which 
you speak. This you shall decide in 
May when you get your copies 
of the annual.
As you probably have noticed 
by this time, we (and I speak here 
for the entire staff) are somewhat 
bitter over your six word state
ment. We have worked hard for 
a yearthe book is completed and 
at the printerand here someone 
who has not so much as looked 
into our office brands our actions 
as rutty.

pression that I am opposed to im
provement of our publications; the 
status quo is by no means perfect. 
I am positive, however, that your 
attitude-of tear it down, which 
is the impression I received upon 
reading the Tartan, will never pro
duce the desired results. Only by 
completely defining the problem, 
and then approaching it construc
tively, can any amelioration be 
achieved. After all, the success or 
failure of any of our publications 
has always been determined not 
by administrative policy, number 
of interested students, or the uni
que accounting system, but by the 
staff itself. This may be considered 
to be my opinion, but a little re
flection and digging up of facts 
will show that there have been 
successful years in every publica
tion, despite all these supposed 
roadblocks.
Reasons are supposedly given, 
telling how our publications fail 
to meet the criteria of a good 
publication. Yet none of the four 
listed ^vhys actually tell why. 
Go back to the beginning, I say, 
and find out just what the prob

you decide whether or not war is 
necessary.

the world by its positive program 
for more equal division of the 
treasures of the earth. To pro
claim the hypocricy of the com
munistic ideal and its practice in 
Russia is only using words to com
bat action, and words until theyre 
turned to action offer poverty 
nothing. The west, mans citadel of 
freedom, must provided its an
swer to the human cry for se
curity within the fabric of its 
freedom. To tax the wealthy into 
poverty is only subtle socialism. 
It is the passive parallel of com
munistic ideology. It is the imi
tation of a way of life that free
dom must avoid, if freedom is to 
survive. What then is. our answer?
Is There Equality?
If there is equality in the crea
tion of man, then it follows there 
is the obligation to sustain that 
equality not only politically and 
socially but also economically; 
thus it is freedoms obligation to 
provide for the common security. 
Christian Democracy has an ac
tive answer based on the prin
cipal of Christian Love and the 
Brotherhood of man; that annwer 
is Profit Sharing. It must be ap
parent to men of wealth through
out the world that they can no 
longer maintain themselves at the 
expense of the laboring masses. 
Either by revolution or extreme 
government control the masses 
will have greater economic equal
ity. Unrestricted Capitalism is 
dead! Wealth thus is faced with a 
choice: either see free enterprise 
and the economic system of our 
way of life vanish from the earth, 
or sustain our economic freedom 
by the true Christian and demo
cratic methods of profit sharing. 
If the Western World adopts this 
answer to mans great cry against 
poverty, Communism as an ideal 
will wither in the minds of men. 
The West will own a course of 
action which answers the univer
sal quest for freedom and security.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

lhey crossed swords with the wrong man 
when they engaged this swashbuckling senior 
in combat! At first, he was foiled by the tricky, 
one-puff . . . one-sniff cigarette mildness tests. 
But he parried their thrusts with this gleaming 
sword of logic: The only way you can judge 
mildness is by steady smoking. Thats the true 
test of cigarette mildness!
Its the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel 
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels 
as your steady smoke, on a day-after-day,

youve tried Camels for 30 days in your T-Zone

cited in both the incoming fresh
men and the upperclassmen each 
year. To accomplish this, a pub
lications exhibit is being planned 
in the Exhibition Room of Fine 
Arts for the first week of school 
next September. The various per
iodicals will have displays to ex
plain the many branches of a pub
lications make-up. A simple pre
sentation of this type will offer 
a striking contrast to the high ten
sions of Freshman Week, there
by maintaining interest longer 
than a high-pressure method of 
recruiting.
Content Discussed
Co.itentOn the material a 
publication presents to its read
ers lies the success or failure of 
that publication. Therefore, to en
rich the content of the several
journals, the editors have decid
ed to meet periodically to discuss 
all problems with particular 
stress on the material published.
This will undoubtedly intro
duce new blood into the publica
tions on the top management level. 
Policy formulation should begin 
on the interpublication plane and, 
subsequently, be congealed by 
each publication according to its 
individual needs. A well integrat
ed press is a powerful force which 
will act for the benefit of all con
nected with Carnegie, so say the 
editors.
Material ControlAt present
no problem exists for the need of 
censorship. However, with an eye 
to the possibility of such a need 
at some future date, the editors 
have advised Pi Delta Epsilon, the 
journalistic fraternity, to create a 
board of review to pass on ma
terial that might be considered 
unfit to publish.

his squad in this important de
cision with 12 points. The Slugs, 
Rockets, and Phi Kaps each have 
identical 7-1 records and must 
play off for the league laurels.
Since the Rockets drew a firstround bye, the Slugs will tackle 
the Phi Kaps on Monday at 4:30; 
the winner of this tilt will meet 
the Rockets on Tuesday.
Highlight IM Night
The overall IM basketball play
offs will also get underway on 
Monday at 7:00 with the DU A 
squad meeting the Citcom A 
team and the Blackhawks battling 
ATO A. This overall competi
tion decides the school champion
ship and the first and second place 
teams in each league participate 
in the race. The opening round 
schedule is as follows:
Delta Upsilon A vs. Citcom 
A
Alpha Tau Omega A vs. 
Blackhawks
National Champion vs. Kappa 
Sigma A
National Runnerup vs. Little
Sekuds
The final round will be held on 
Intramural night, Friday, at 8:00 
p.m. in the Skibo gym.
Little Sekuds Favored
With 6'6" Tex Richards, tallest 
man in IM play, the Little Sekuds 
seem to be the team to beat in the 
run down. Justification of this 
opinion was given when they wal
loped the Phi Kap B team 103- 
10 to set the seasons scoring rec
ord. They have plenty of bal
ance, strong reserves, and are a 
solid choice to win the CIT crown.
The strongest contention should 
come from the DUs and the 
ATOs. Second seeded DU, center
ing around high-scoring Buckshot OReilly, has a strong versa
tile squad which features a fast 
break and deceptive tactics.
On the basis of experience alone, 
the ATOs would be the logical 
choice to bring home the trophy. 
This squad is built around three 
players from last years freshman 
team, and should not be over
looked.
Rockets Rated as Shady Entry
As a dark-horse candidate, the 
National League Rockets, who 
have yet to secure their league 
title, seem most likely to drive 
through to the trophy. A skyscraping team, with three men 
topping six-four, will be hard to 
stop in the heavy competition.
TROPHIES
Intramural Director, Raymond Red Haynes, and Intramural 
Board President, Roy Djuvik, are shown with the trophies that wiU 
be presented to intramural winners on Intramural Night, Frida?, 
March 21. Presentation will be held at intermission of the informal

1952 Exhibition 
In Skibo Pool
The 1952 edition of the WAA 
Tarquans presented its annual wa

day and Saturday. A troupe of 34 
girls and 7 fellows combined their 
efforts in 13 precision displays.
Early in the progrm, Grey Dun
can, the Plaids ace intercollegiate 
diver, gave a thrilling exhibition 
of springboard gymnastics while 
explanations of his gyrations were 
provided by a moderator.
Shortly after the diving exhibi
tion the womens ensemble pre
sented the basic twists, turns, and 
methods of locomotion that are the 
initial structure of any water bal
let.
The male mermaids, associate 
members of the WAA, were not to 
be outdone. Their presentation of 
Techniques and Skills was in 
the slapstick vaudeville manner 
that is typical of Irv Schechter, 
their non-aquatic director.

pTUESDAY, MARCH 18, 1952 TAIWAN
WAA Makes Amazons 
Of Carnegie Females
Innumerable protests by irate male students have made it essen
tial for the Tartan sports department to conduct a comprehensive 
# investigation of the Womens Athletic association (hereinafter to be
known as the WAA).
It is with great regret, that we 
must announce that this organiza
tion, even in our modern age of 
tolerance and equality, is discrim
inatory. It excludes men. For no 
sane or sensible reason, no male 
can be a full member of the WAA.
Numerals, Letters, Blazers
The heart of the WAA is in the 
varsity sports teams, which play 
interscholastic sports on the fe
male level. In order to organize 
such teams (or clubs, as they are 
known in technical circles), six 
participants are needed for indi
vidual sports, 12 for team games.
About 120 girls partake of these 
activities, and are rewarded for 
their efforts by numerals, letters, 
and blazers (jackets).
Also nestled under the WAA 
thumb are the womens intramural 
\ sports, which are beginning at 
CIT this year. At present, basket
ball, the current sport, is played 
by some 63 WAA sponsored par
ticipants.
Sports on the WAA list include 
archery, badminton, basketball, 
field hockey, golf, softball, tennis, 
volleyball, modern dancing (what
ever that might be), square danc
ing, and the annual Tarquan water 
show, which accepts the services of 
male students, despite their inability to become full-fledged WAA 
members.
Free
The association is connected na
tionally with a mysterious group 
known as the PDAFCW, or Penn
sylvania Division, Athletic Feder
ation of College Women. This 
group, it seems, holds annual con
ferences, at which Carnegie WAA 
members confer.

Laments Of Freshman Alchemist 
To Be Aired In New Series
Editors note: The Tartan has suceeded in securing the services 
of John J. John, Jr., son of a wealthy sanitary fixtures maanate, 
and presently a student at CIT, to present his life story as a typical 
student. Mr. John is a veritable paragon of perspicacity, but un
fortunately, being an E&S student, can write only his name and the 
word ohm. His thoughts have therefore been set down for print 
by a Tartan reporter, carefully retaining the original thoughts of 
the author. 3
By J. J. John, Jr. as told to R. Durstine 
Since coming to Carnegie Tech, I have become hardened to life 
at the worlds foremost engineering school. I now hardly mind it 
at all, but for the record, permit me to recount a typical morning 
in the life of an irregular alchemist.
Breakfast ?---------------------------------------------------------
At 7:30 on the morning of March 
, I was roused from a fitful 
sleep on my hard pallet in McBoss 
Hall by the comely cleaning wench 
who had come to make my bed and 
set my scant belongings in order.
I dressed, left the dorm, and 
went to Skibo for a customary 
bowl of thin guel and slab of hard, 
black bread.
Physics Instructors, Dogs
I then stepped out into the 
world, fresh and
swinging at m3' 
side, and my
alligator skin ^j Jw $1
briefcase packj.
bles. My only ^ , \
class that morn%
ing was a Soc^
Rel, but it is Durstine 
always good for
the engineering student to carry 
tables. One never knows when he 
might need them.
As I strode down the hall past 
flocks of black-frocked physics in
structors and an occasional dog in 
search of Skibo, I prepared myself 
for Instructor Attilas 50 minute 
claim on my time.
Inept Adept
Instructor Attila teaches, among 
other things, an elective course in 
History of Dead Civilizations I, a 
prerequisite to History of Dead 
Civilizations II. He is a squat 
man, with unkempt hair, a picture 
of mediocrity, a bulwark of the 
Carnegie plan, adept at asking 
questions, inept at answering them.
I entered the room, seated my
self on a hard, straight-backed 
chair and prepared my notes. Pro
fessor Attila entered, and in his 
well-modulated drone, requested 
Are there any questions, gentle
men? There were, of course, 
none.
What is a Tree?
Subsequently, the professor re
quested a definition for a tree, the 
topic for the day being Tree Wor
ship in Ancient Rome, or What 
can Fungus do to Religion?
A gaunt EE near the front of the 
room lifted a bony claw, and vol
unteered, A tree is a vegetable 
growth, characterized by a woody 
stalk.
We were off. Hands shot up all 
over the room. What do you 
mean growth? How is vegetable 
defined? How are we to take 
the term woody? Wouldnt that 
include sun-fiowers? etc., etc.
Instructor Delighted
And so we defined terms; we de
fined definitions; we defined defini
tions of definitions. To hear us 
one would think we had no con
cept of what a tree was at all. But 
we were infected with Carnegie 
plan fever, and could not stop.
Instructor Attila was delighted. 
He likes spirited discussions. They 
give him a reputation for skill as 
a teacher, and require much less 
work than a prepared lecture. 
That is why he chose a controver
sial issue such as trees to start the 
class off with. A shrewd bunch, 
these history instructors.
Proud to be Alchemist
Soon the period was over. We 
had not discussed tree worship in 
ancient Rome. We had not dis
cussed ancient Rome. We had not 
even discussed trees. In fact, we 
had never defined them. And it is 
impossible to discuss without pro
per definitions.
I am grateful that I am an al
chemist. We have books of defini
tions. We do not have to argue 
such deep points as the meaning 
of tree. We can dive straight 
into the problem. It is much easier 
that way. I am proud to be an ] 
alchemist.
CIT Physcis Grad 
Now Clergyman 
On Chapel Agenda
The Reverend Don H. Gross, a 
Carnegie graduate of 1944, will be 
the speaker for the 11:20 Chapel 
to be held on March 25 in the Fine 
Arts Little Theater. He will speak 
about The Foolishness of God, 
which, he says, is wiser than the 
wisdom of men.
When Gross was at Tech, every
one who knew him assumed that 
he would become a physicist or a 
radio engineer. After he received 
his B.S. in Physics at Carnegie 
Tech in 1944, he went into the 
Navy as a radar officer, ending up 
at the naval research laboratories 
in Washington.
After the war, Gross decided to 
enter the ministry, and in 1946 he 
entered the Episcopal Theological 
school in Cambridge, Massachu
setts. He completed his studies 
for the ministry in 1949, and was 
ordained deacon, then priest, by 
the Rt. Rev. Austin Pardue, Bish
op of Pittsburgh. For two years he 
was pastor of the Trinity Episco
pal church in Rochester, Pennsyl
vania. Last August, Gross became 
priest of St. Peters Episcopal 
church, Brentwood.

Editorial
Appreciation
The students in Evening School are fortunate to have 
such excellent instructors available to them at Carnegie Tech. 
Most of these men are employed in business and industry 
during the day. This is advantageous to the evening student 
because the instructor can give him the benefit of his own 
personal experiences in addition to the theoretical knowl
edge garnered in the classroom.
The fact that these men, whether full-time faculty mem
bers or not, are working extra hours the same as the student 
gives all a common field of endeavor. In fact, many of the 
instructors are also attending school part-time, working to
ward their masters or doctors degree.
Their sacrifices in time and effort are no less than those 
of the most conscientious evening student. They appre
ciate honest endeavor and cooperation on the part of the 
student body. '

noxious fumes have not been in 
operation for some time
The physics class in room 211 
was forced to vacate because of 
lack of light to a room across the 
hall which suffered from a lack 
of heat. Possibly some of the in
creased tuition costs can be al
located for the correction of these 
conditions.

Insignia Key Points 
As Of March 1 Listed
Each year a group of students from evening school receives recog
nition for participation in extra-curricular activities at the banquet 
where Insignia keys are awarded. Many students do not realize how 
easy it is to earn the 20 points required, while others stop just
short of their goal somewhere* 
along the way. You are given two 
semesters in which to earn the 
necessary 20 points, so the follow
ing list represents just a progress 
report - of the participating stu
dents.
To serve both as a reminder and 
as a means of recognizing the 
work done by these students, the 
following list showing the points 
earned as of. March 1, 1952, is 
presented.

LARGEST SELLING CIGARETTE IN AMERICAS COLLEGES
[GA^ETTE^
SIGNED
The Gong
[Continued from page 6] 
by the name of Harry Wright, who 
has a friendly hello and good-bye 
for every person that pays a call at 
Morewood.
Maybe outsiders are horrified 
by the coats posted at the ports 
cf entry to the Morewood seclud
ed dugouts, keeping out wander
ing trespassers; by the death 
clinches that engulf them every
where; or by the last-minute 
stampede of Romeos to the cloak
room. but not Harry. Its all in a 
days work!
One of the most important 
things to remember about Harry 
is that Business comes before 
pleasure,' and promptness is his 
motto. He doesnt become enrap
tured w'ith the murmur of sweetnothings when its time to ring the 
gong, so be prepared for a slight 
pause in station identification 
Morewood Gardens, 12:25, gong 
timeamidst the romantic sur
roundings.
Gesundheit
Obviously a certain romantic 
couple of Morewood wasnt aware 
of the crucial hour or didnt hear 
Harry's footsteps, becaue one of 
the pair was so badly frightened 
by the gong that he let out with a 
geusundheit that practically up
rooted Morewood.
We dont want to turn away any 
customers from our doorstep, but 
We would like to make a request: 
Please synchronize your watches
Floaters!
Spring Carnival Float com
mittee will have a meeting: at 
4:30 p.m., Thursday, March 20, 
in Room A of the Carnegie 
Union.

[Contimied from page 2] 
the desire for achievement as do 
Socialism and Communism; it pro
vides se'curity for all without a 
limitation of freedom by govern
ment control; it sustains the con
cept of the equality of mans crea
tion by assuming the obligation to 
protect equality; it reestablishes 
the Christian way of life in the 
economic way of life. By fulfilling 
the edict to be our brothers keep
er, Christian Democracy and Profit 
Sharing puts an end to the greed 
and jungle laws of Capitalism. 
Profit sharing offers the West the 
way of sustaining its freedom and 
the answer to the needs of our 
times. Profit sharing is not alone 
an ideal, it is practiced by many 
of our nations industries and 
business. Think about this. If we 
find no answer to the economic 
needs of men, it follows then that 
our way of life will crumble and 
die.
with Harry, because one more big 
sneeze might blow down the 
dwelling, and we cant afford an
other. Tuition is high enough now!
