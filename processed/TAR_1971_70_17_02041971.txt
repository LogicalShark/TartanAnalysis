Cavanaghs State of the University 
Speech Dominates Senate Meeting
by MARGARET WACKER
Pres. Stever Creates 
Community Board
The dominating event at the Student Senate meeting was Patrick Cavanaghs address on the state of the university.
After a few opening remarks, Cavanagh proceeded to review what he saw as the three most important problems involving the university community.
The first problem he stated as being a question of the Universitys relation to and role in the surrounding community. During the past few years, particularly since last falls elections, there has been as ever increasing alienation of students from people in general.
The solution to this problem involves not only student attention but the concern of faculty and administrators as well. Starting now, there must be a general coming together of all branches of the university to work towards a viable solution.
At present, Cavanagh said, it
The Board of Trustees had directed that the proceedings of its meetings be published for the information of the campus community. The following proceedings describe what was done at the Board meeting on Jan. 18,1971 :
1. The name of the Hunt Botanical Library was changed to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation as more accurately descriptive of its activiyies.
2. Approval was given to the appointment of Dr. Aksel A. Bothner-By as Dean of Mellon Institute of Science, effective April 1,1971.
3. The Trustees Committee on Student Affairs strongly endorsed the statement on goals, rights and responsibilities, but suggested two concerns for the consideration of the president: The possible misinterpretation of the termi standards and the inclusion in a policy statement of topical matters that should more appropria ately be incorporated in a publication of regulations. The president said he would be glad to consider adjusting the document in the light of these concerns and it was approved with the understanding that this adjustment would be considered.
4. To succeed Aiken W. Fisher, whose five-year term as chairman of the Board will expire at the meeting on April 19, 1971, and who had indicated that he did not wish to be renominated, Fred C. Foy was elected as chairman beginning with the April meeting.* he Board expressed thanks and appreciation for Mr. Fishers distinguished service to CarnegieMellon University.
appears that such a solution will involve some basic structural changes in order that university policy will involve some basic structural changes in order that university policy will help to meet community needs.
The second question in the address was: Does the student government in acually serve the students? Some areas presently being dealt with by student government are medical aid, student housing and the peace treaties but these are not enough. If more is not done in the future, student government will have failed.
Cavanaghs third and final point concerned financeshow money is collected and employed for student government and the university as a whole.
Up until now, part of each students tuition goes to the support of student government.
Cavanagh recommended that a separate fee collection program be set up specifically for the stu5. A lengthy report of the Budget Committee was presented. Work is going forward on the budget for 1971-72, with the Educational and General Operations Budget to be reduced from the current level of $22,267,000 to not in excess of $20,615,000 so that the operating deficit that must be covered by gifts and grants will be $500,000 or less. The goal is to reduce the academic budget 5% in total, but to provide flexibility in making reductions an across the board cut of 5% in each department is not mandatory. In the nonacademic budget the goal is a reduction of 10%. In both the academic and nonacademic areas there will necessarily be some reduction in faculty and staff positions. The first review of budget requests indicates that good progress toward these goals is being made.
6. The Buildings and Grounds report noted that the budget for 1971-72 will mean staff reductions in building maintenance and custodial service. The University was authorized to sell certain non-continuous properties including the Spear-Klee land. In the disposition of the Spear-Klee land there was duscussion of the importance of considering community relations as 
well as income.
One of the major problems still facing the University is the financing of the Computer Center, which is essential to both educational programs and research. The staff has already been cut 60%, but the major cost

dent government and that a referendum be introduced to decide whether there should be a mandatory or voluntary fee from those involved.
In relation to the last point is the question: academically, does one get what one pays for? Does the $2,500 tuition fee adequately contribute to student education? Cavanagh pointed out that tuition goes towards 20 per cent of the budget but only nine per cent of the budget is used for classroom and teaching provisions. The need for educational research and reforms should be recognized and implemented.
There were several other items of interest at the meeting:
The NSA Peace Treaty was to be discussed and voted on at this meeting but the motion was abruptly tabled once again.
There was a lenghty discussion on the reapportionment of the constituencies of the student government. The motion was then tabled in the rules committee.
Two impeachment cases were reviewed. Bill Midvidy was impeached while it was noted that the other senator, Gerri Spilka, had resigned.
Motions were carried to donate money to the Martin Luther King Scholarship Fund and the Artificial Kidney Fund.
Lastly, a motion was passed to state the senates opinion in favor maintaining the Study Skills Center, even while acknowledging the universitys budgetary difficulties.

In talking with John Golden, coordinator of the Office of Community Affairs, this past week, the position that the Y-CA office holds became a little more clearcut. That position is one of a twofold program; the encouraging of people who are committed to reshaping the university and the encouragement of a counter-culture are the two broad goals that the Y-CA office has set for itself.
The Y-CA office is moving in the direction of more student/ faculty involvement and would like to see more students and faculty members involved in the decisions concerning this direction. A few years ago, the office changed its name from the Office of Religious Affairs to that of Community Affars; it was hoped that through this move the office could be more integrally related to the University without, at the same time, becoming a part of
To Advise
In order that all the campus community share in the responsibility of security, President Stever last Monday announced the establishment of a Security Policy Advisory Board.
Replacing the Security Review Committee, the Security Policy Advisory Board will be composed of undergraduate and graduate students, junior and senior faculty, custodial and maintainance personnel, laboratory technicians, librarians and secretaries, up to a maximum membership of 32.
More broadly conceived and constructed than the Review Committee, the Security Policy Advisory Board will advise the VicePresident for Business Affairs on matters pertaining to the preservation ,f a free learning environment and the protection of the life and property of all the campus community.
Remarking on the Boards broad plans for membership, Board member and SUPA Professor Robert Shellow said, Hopefully, we will be able to develop policies so that all conflicting campus interests can be expressthe establishment. In addition to promoting its on campus role, the office is also able to continue its joint affairs with the YM and YWCA.
Working under the assumption that anything worth doing as a volunteer is also worth doing for credit, the Drug Seminar has evolved. This is a Seminar that is being given by the Alegheny County Public Health Department as training for their Public Health workers. By a special arrangement, five C-MU students have been given permission to participate in this Seminar. The Seminar is divided into 12 week sessions that delve into all areas of
Security
ed in non-destructive ways.
Specifically, the Boards functions will include reviewing security policies and procedures, making recommendations and working in liaison with the Presidents Advisory Board during emergencies.
The Board will also receive complaints or commendations concerning Security Services, and generally act as a communications link between Security Services and the campus community.
At present, 15 members have been selected with other members to be added. The present 15 members are:
1. Robert Shellow (F)2. Baker Salsbury (F)3. Lee Bolman (F)
4. James Laing (F)5. Robert Dunlap (F)
6. Joel Tarr (F)7. James Romualdi (F)8. Thomas Kerr (F)9. David Craig (F)
10. Ken Fields (S)11. Frank Cox (S)12. Dave Caney (S)13. Diane Remin (S)14. Roger Dooly (S)15. William Mayo (S)
the drug problem. By merely taking part in the Seminar, participants will receive six unit credits. Those working in conjunction with a C-MU psychology teacher and writing a research paper will receive 12 unit credits.
This Drug Seminar is just one example of the goal the office has in mindthat of providing space for new ideas. If you have a project you are especially interested in, something that could possibly be interpreted as a course, by working with the Y-CA office your ideas may be realized in the establishment of a new course.

the sun rose today
The sun rose today.
The sun rose yesterday
And it will rise tomorrow.
But even though it gives light to the whole world,
It never touches me
. ... for I am alone . ..
By what right have I been chosen to suffer.
Who has said
. . . You will die 
A thousand times a thousand deaths . . .
Looking for a smile. Looking for a friend to be with.
Not for me
. . . I am alone . . .
An extended hand is slapped down.
Dare I chance a smile. It is scorned.
And so
... I die a thousand times a thousand times . . .
Can I learn of love.
Will I find compassion.
Why me
. . . What God have I transgressed . ..
What demon
Has placed me 
In his personal hell.
Why must I
. . . Die a thousand times a thousand deaths . . .

Editorial
I have just obtained a copy of President Stevers Annual 
Report, and since this document is not generally available to 
students and staff, I thought I might comment on it, giving 
a few highlights: a review or book report, as it were. I am 
trying to resist the temptation to facetiously grade it as a 
school paper, as this would be taking even greater unfair ad
vantage of Dr. Stever than I am.
It is interesting to note, for instance, that Dr. Stever con
siders the new College of Humanities and Social Sciences a 
success (quotes mine). On the same page of the report he de
fines the primary problem facing Carnegie-Mellon University 
as student activism. Also in this section, the president attri
butes the two major protest actions of last year to a small 
faction (of students) who did not want the issues resolved 
but only wanted an excuse for demonstrations.
On page nine, Dr. Stever states, with admirable confi
dence (honestly), that, The university does not discriminate 
in its own employment practices. Further on in this section, 
the report informs us (without actually saying so) that the 
Board of Trustees refused last years request from Student Sen
ate to admit student representatives into its ranks (it is inter
esting to note here that our Board of Trustees contains ex 
officio seats for the President of Pittsburghs City Council, 
the Mayor of the city, and the president of Carnegie Institute, 
so if you want to be on the board, run for City Council). For 
those of us who groove on facts, figures, and data, the next 
section, entitled Finances, offers some delectable goodies. The 
university had an operating budget deficit of $2.98 million. 
Income from sponsored research substantially exceeded income 
from tuition and fees. The school does not keep a separate 
accounting category for instructional costs, but lumps it to
gether with something called departmental research, so, so 
much for finding out what YOUR education costs.
An aesthetic comment on this rather handsome document 
is that it is strange to see a picture of a demonstration which 
I believe took place in 1964, over girls curfew hours, in an 
annual report for 1970.
As this goes to press our government is still maintain
ing a news blanket over what is happening in Laos. This 
seems particularly odious to me. It appears that our Repre
sentative government no longer trusts its own people with 
the knowledge of what it is doing. This doesnt mean that 
no one knows. In fact, you could probably get better news 
coverage in France or India. My suspicion is that the Ameri
can people are the only people in the world who are not being 
told what is happening in Laos. Ive even heard rationaliza
tion of this in terms of trying to prevent another public re
action like Cambodia. If this is the real reason, it is a sad 
state whose rulers must keep its actions secret to prevent its 
citizens from protesting in the streets. It is a curious bending 
of the free press when the government controls movement 
in an entire sub-continent, and then wont allow news from 
there.
There is a peculiar intensity to the grimness of the win
ter in Pittsburgh. Im not sure of the nature of its essence, 
but it has something to do with not seeing the sun for weeks 
at a time; something to do with the color of the thin layer of 
snow that your windshield wipers deposit in a diagonal line 
in front of you in the morning; something to do with the 
gritty texture of the dried grey slush in the entrance ways 
of all the buildings; something to do with the non-verbal 
conversations that take place in Skibo surrounded by mounds 
of coats and scarves when the only sounds made are soft 
groans punctuated by an occasional ghhughk.

COMMENTARY
1. An identification card will be 
issued by authorized professional 
staff of the home library to the 
student needing to borrow from 
another participating library, cov
ering the material needed in the 
particular transaction. The per
mission slip will be issued, there
fore, after local resources have 
been canvassed and it will be is
sued to the appropriate library 
where the material is available.
2. Borrowing will be governed 
by the circulation policies of the 
host institution. At the time of ar
ranging for borrowing privileges, 
students should check on library 
hours.
3. Students will be responsible 
for any fines incurred or books
lost.
The provisions governing this 
experiment are generous. This ex
periment will open varied and 
rich library resources to under
graduate students. The smooth 
operation of the system during 
the trial period will determine the 
continuation of this enlightened 
library experiment. This agree
ment among libraries has been 
instituted by the Pittsburgh Re
gional Library Center.

i intention, including the name, ad
dress, and phone number of two
