DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG AD
DRESSES THE UPPER
CLASSMEN.
FOOT BALL.
On last Monday morning Dr. Hamerschlag delivered an address of wel
come to the members of the two upper 
classes. His arrival was greeted with 
a storm of applause which lasted for 
some time. After it had subsided he 
said:
I am delighted to be here and am 
glad to see you here. I want to say 
a few words to the upper classmen 
today preparatory to the beginning 
of your years work. The years work 
begins in a few moments; in fact, I am 
taking the time of the teachers who 
will begin work this afternoon.
My greatest pleasure is to bring you 
into contact with the new men who 
have been taken on the faculty while 
you have been away, and who have 
come here to help develop the move
ment so efficiently started by the 
other teachers whom you know. At 
the conclusion of my address I am go
ing to ask the new men to come up 
to this platform and receive your wel
come. In the meantime I am going to 
take up some other questions.
First, and most important, it seems 
to me, is your relation to the enter
ing class. This is a problem which 
cannot be worked out without your 
co-operation. It has been suggested 
that it is the impression of the stu(Continued on page 4.)
The outlook for football at Carnegie 
Tech. this year is very promising. 
The team that will represent the 
school this fall is expected to make a 
much better showing than the very 
satisfactory team of last year.
Mr. J. H. Leet has been selected 
as chief athletic adviser. His advice 
will be of great value, as he has long 
been interested in college athletics.
Mr. Aude, the new instructor in 
mathematics, will be head coach. 
Prof. Aude formerly played for Col
gate, and is thoroughly capable of 
handling the team. His selection is 
especially fortunate, as his strongest 
point is coaching the line, and this is 
our weakest feature.
As trainer, Joe Thompson has been . 
secured. He is a first class man and 
can be relied on to put the players in 
first class shape. In addition to these 
regular officials, Capt. Yecklein of last 
years Penn State team, has volun
teered his services, and will help 
Coach Aude from time to time.
Practice started on the tenth, and 
has been held daily since. As Capt. 
Adams has left school (Why? be
cause hes married now) the varsity 
men elected Scotty Henderson in 
his place. Henderson did good work 
last year, and as he combines per
sonal popularity and good executive 
abilities with a thorough knowledge of 
(Continifed on page 5.)

DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG AD
DRESSES THE UPPER
CLASSMEN.
(Continued from page 1.) 
dent that he is only once a freshman, 
and should know the sensations of be
ing a freshman. It is likewise true 
that a student is only once a senior 
in the true sense of the word, and as 
he graduates immediately afterward, 
he thinks he should have the special 
prerogatives which come to him on ac
count of his being a senior.
In some institutions, classmen wish
ing to assert their position give cer
tain evidences by which a student is 
distinguishable. A peculiar kind of 
cap or gown in some instances, and in 
others some walking with canes and 
others without canes, and sometimes 
the wearing of the straw hats after 
the 15th of September.
Now, however, it seems to me that 
we have reached the state of intellec
tual development where certain kinds 
of student initiation are exceedingly 
detrimental, to the plebe and other 
classes as well, and frequently result 
in the physical impairment of in
dividuals. It is now time for a certain 
departure to be made. I am asking 
these upper classes to extend an in
vitation to the plebe cr freshmen class 
to participate in a barbecue, which
* means a feast or social gathering. In
cidentally, if you wish to have any 
contest to show your superiority athle
tically, do so in an orderly and or
ganized manner, and if you determine 
to extend this invitation to the bar
becue to this entering class, do it with 
royal good will and hospitality; do it 
in the right sense, and with a good 
deal of enthusiasm; make it count; 
make it significant that the day for 
the class rush and rowdyism is pass
ing. Substitute this lunction that 
gives you a good opportunity to get 
acquainted, and has its social features 
which are attractive.
For the benefit of those who do not 
understand what a barbecue means,
THE TARTAN
the original barbecue was a feast be
tween barbarous tribes when they par
took of the game which had been shot. 
At the feast it was usually whole and 
was roasted on spits, probably a deer 
or buffalo, and in Europe and older 
countries other extractions were intro
duced. Set this tradition, because I 
believe that no group of students, no 
group of human beings, sit down to 
dine and carry away any feeling -of 
animosity; since the early times the 
breaking of bread has been the sign 
of peace, good will and friendship, and 
surely that is the way you want to ap
pear to the entering class.
Now I want to bring your attention 
and to talk a little bit about students 
societies. Student societies grow if 
there is a reason for their existence; 
they wither and die otherwise. A cer
tain number have prospered during 
the past, year, you have unanimously 
voted to assess the day students $2.00 
and the night students $1.00 for the 
development of students societies. 
Now the one which expects to get 
the biggest part of this fun is the 
athletic association. If you are inter
ested in these societies it is the time 
to get together and make a requisi
tion for a certain reserve or a propor
tion for that purpose.
It is unnecassary for me to more 
than remark that in addition to the 
two existing rooming houses or dormi
tories a third one will be secured 
shortly, and that students out of town 
should report their names to the sec
retary in order to be accommodated.
In connection with your scholarship 
standing, I am going to refer you in
dividually and collectively to Mr. 
Leete, the Registrar, who will deal 
out justice and will deal it out wisely, 
and whom I think will best express 
the opinion of the faculty. He will 
endeavor to explain to you what ac
tion has been taken upon your case.
I advise you, therefore, one and all, 
not to hesitate to go to him for all 
explanations of your records. He will
then explain with kindness and judg
ment, and I feel confident, after ask
ing his advice, you will have little dif
ficulty in solving your problem.
I now want to speak on a subject 
which ordinarily is not touched upon 
in an address of this kind.
We realize that you are going to 
begin to be an intelligent and an ef
fective force in the community, and I 
want to call attention to the great socalled unrest which seems to be 
dominating all social spheres in the 
United States, which finds its expres-Asion in the various addresses of Presi
dent Roosevelt, and in a great group 
of party leaders, demagogues, par
tisans and socialists, and I want to 
ask you in all fairness to yourselves to 
read these articles with judgment and 
moderation. Begin to appreciate that 
a statement, no matter how emphati
cally made, no matter how important 
in a given direction, is necessarily en
tirely true. Believe with me that this 
is a pretty good country, and that we 
have a pretty good constitution. The 
American constitution is not wholly 
at fault; I believe that the interpreta
tion is at fault. It is time, now for 
you, who are no longer plebes or fresh
men, to recognize the value of modera
tion. It is a good thing to be able to 
recognize the demagogues in public 
life, men who use their abilities to 
advance their personal interest. I 
am going to tell you how to do this. 
Find out who are the demagogues in 
your classes and do not go to the 
extremes. Use your own headsdont 
vote according to a single idea. Stop, 
hesitate and think and separate the 
real opinion from the opinion of the 
demagogue or ranter, and you will find 
them in your class, just as surely as 
you will find them elsewhere.
Follow reason and well defined judg
ment. If you do that, some of these 
student questions which seem extreme
ly important to you and extremely 
onerous at the time, will solve them
selves. Dont go to extremes.

---------------------------------------------------

- >; You need athletics and you need a 
good physical body. Dont allow any 
man to come up and tell you that 
athletics and physical well-being in 
this institution depends upon any one 
individualit does notit depends 
upon you all.
All I ask of you in that you care
fully take up these questions and pass 
upon them with conservative reason
ing. I hold that, in this institution, 
value of moderation and conservatism 
in espousing the development of any 
fcause is of the greatest importance. 
;I want you to realize that it is more 
important here than anywhere else, 
fi because you are laying the foundation 
; of a tradition which will go on to the 
| classes which come after you.
Take for your ideal strong, healthyminded, clean, quick thinking men. 
Live joyously, dont become book
worms. Have your own individual 
developmentdont be sheep and go 
because somebody else goes. You be
long to an organization if you can 
win under the colors of your Tartan, 
go in and win.
Let me say this to you, at the open
ing of your yearRemember that you 
can inspire the new student. Their 
attitude depends largely on what you 
make it. Have minds of your own and 
work out your own salvation. Live 
the right kind of lives and I am con
fident that you will be successful.
The address was concluded by the 
introduction of the new faculty.

one.
Two good men who will not be on 
the team this year are Grafton, who

is now at Annapolis and Decker, who 
expects to go West. Of the other old 
men, Urling, Dowling, Beeker, Charles, 
Henderson, Harter, Eggers, Schmuck 
er and Shaub have been out. Foster is 
back from his trip abroad, and Ramp 
will be in his suit in a day or two. 
Gus Kann, who played center last year 
in a remarkably nervy and snappy 
manner, is taking a course at the 
night school. He has not decided to 
play this year, but Capt. Henderson 
hopes to persuade him to come out. 
In addition to the old men, there are 
a number of good players in the Plebe 
class who should strengthen the team 
materially.
Captain Henderson requests all 
men wishing to try for the team to 
come out to practice daily. One of 
the most important games of the year 
will come early in the season, and it 
is important that the team get in 
shape soon.
No pains will be spared to put out 
a team that will be a credit to Tech, 
and the students should help by com
ing out to watch the squad at work.

THE WRECK OF THE STRAW HAT.
Early Monday morning (by early 
we mean 8 oclock or thereabouts), 
when the students were gathering in 
front of the building to witness the 
opening of another school year, with 
all the necessary ceremony, Scotty 
Henderson hove in sight at the top 
of the hill with his summer headgear 
on deck and still doing duty. When 
he was told that the time for such 
articles was past he loyally contri
buted his hat to start the fun. It may 
be well to state that up to this time 
there had been absolutely nothing do
ing, so Scotty was only trying to 
relieve the monotony of the situation. 
Next came Wink Dowling and his 
mighty frame was capped by a sailor 
of somewhat uncertain vintage, but it 
went the way of the first and helped 
to form the pile in front. In a few 
moments the pile had grown alarm
ingly and the number of bare heads 
was quite noticeable. Then some hap
py genius thought of stringing them 
up on a line like the weeks washing. 
This warning was heeded by two gen
tlemen, who were seen to stop, look, 
and listen, and then to turn and walk 
briskly in the direction of Oakland. 
When one of them made his appear
ance later in the day he possessed a
shining \new derby. Another, when 
he saw that all hope was lost, gaily 
tossed his lid to the angry mob, and 
was noted a good sport by all pres
ent. A young lady tripping gaily up 
the walk to the School for Women 
was voted a good sport by all presmarks about her straw hat, but, of 
course, remarking was as far as it 
went.
When the bunch was all together 
they were draped attractively around
one of the lamps on the stairway, and 
there they swung until nightfall, when 
our burly friend Directoribus col
lected them and had them secretly fed 
to the horse in the back of the school.
SANDPAPERING MACHINE.
At the recent International Building 
Trades Exhibition, a new sandpaper
ing machine was exhibited.
The machine has, we believe, prov
ed to be a very useful type. The sand
paper is in the form of a wide belt, 
which passes over a pulley or drum 
at each end of the frame,, provision be
ing made so that one of the pulleys 
can be adjusted in order to take up 
any slack that may arise. The dust 
is carried away into a casing, which 
surrounds the pulley at the right hand 
end of the machine, and passes down 
into a pipe at the bottom. The work 
to be operated on is, of course, placed 
on the top of the sandpaper as the 
latter travels, and there is an adjust
able stop which prevents the work be
ing carried along with the paper.
Mr. Pfouts, take notice.

wood fibre, at Heimerts, Iroquois

THE TARTAN7
HOW TO SWIM.
Anyone who has the patience can 
learn to swim. A person directed by 
a competent instructor should learn 
in from six to ten lessonsthat is, be 
able to get the necessary confidence 
in themselves, after which improve
ment follows rapidly. One often hears 
some person tell of being thrown into 
a river, away back in his childhood 
days, and made to swim. When a boy 
is thrown into the water and is un
able to swim it is more luck than any
thing else that saves him.
In starting a beginner I use what is 
known as the breast stroke or Eng
lish sailor stroke, as it is more com
monly called. It is the simplest and 
easiest to learn, and, once learned 
properly, one should be able to swim 
for two or three hours, while in using 
other strokes such as trudgeon, or 
double over arm, or the side stroke 
one tires more rapidly. The arm 
movement of the breast stroke is com
posed of three distinct movements, 
two of which are negative and one 
positive, a positive movement being 
the one which advances the beginner 
while the negative retards. The leg 
movements are directly opposite, hav
ing one negative and two positive.
A beginner not having the aid of an 
instructor should enter the water 
about waist high, stoop low enough to 
allow the shoulders to be submerged, 
carefully balance himself, extend the 
arms at full length with fingers ex
tended, the palms of the hand turned 
slightly outward, so as to give the 
hands the shape of a scoop. At the 
count of one bring the arms slowly 
back until on a straight line with the 
shoulders, at two the elbows should 
be brought down close to the sides 
with the hands perfectly flat, slightly 
below the surface of the water and di
rectly under the chin; the third move
ment i made as a thrust, shooting 
the hands straight out to their former 
positions. This should be practiced
until the beginner feels that he or she 
has the movement well regulated.
The leg movement can be practiced 
by lying flat upon a plank or holding 
on to some object, the body lying at 
an angle of about 45 degrees with the 
legs extended, heels together and toes 
pointed backward. At the count of 
one draw the knees underneath you 
and separate them without separating 
the heels (in this movement the back 
should not be bent, the movement 
should be made from the hip and 
knee). The second and third move
ments are made nearly as one move
ment, which consists of the legs being 
spread (describing a circle as nearly 
as possible) and then brought sharp
ly together again, as at the beginning. 
It is not necessary to waste your 
strength; in other words, you should 
exert your arms as little as possible, 
allowing the legs to do most of the 
work. The two movements should be 
used as follows: The first or back
ward sweep of the arms should be 
made while the legs are still straight; 
in bringing the arms up to the sides, 
the knees should be drawn under, as 
th arms are thrust forward, the last 
two movements of the legs should 
finish as the arms are fully extended, 
thus placing the body in a position to 
glide through the water six or eight 
feet between each stroke. Another 
essential thing, and which is really 
the secret of swimming, is the breath
ing. In all the strokes the inhalation 
is made just before the legs are 
drawn into position for the kick, which 
gives the body the necessary buoyancy 
and support for the two negative 
strokes that follow. The exhalation 
should be during the last part of the 
leg movement. The more regularly 
one breathes the easier it is to learn 
to swim.Guy M. Dailey, Managing 
the Oakland Arcade Co.

ON ATHLETICS.
The sailor is much valued who can 
read in the heavens the approaching 
storm. The business man that manu
factures articles for which there is a 
demand, or creates the demand for 
that which he produces, is much 
sought after. Why? Simply because 
he is the one that understands condi
tions. If we are to make a success 
out of our athletics, we must study 
conditions, local conditions. I mean 
not the success that alone knows vic
tory, rather the success that goes with 
a good healthy body and the strong 
bond of friendship that is fostered by 
the lowest effort of many young men 
striving for the same goal. Lets put 
just such effort into our recreation, 
and whether defeat or victory be ours, 
we will be well repaid for the hours 
spent together.
Let me warn you as we start out on 
this journey; unless you keep up to 
the required standard in the class 
room, you are of little service to your
self, and, indeed, a detriment to the 
school. First, because you are not 
giving to your studies the required 
thought or time, and you had better 
be doing something else. Seconly, 
if you have practiced for several weeks 
for a place on the foot ball team and 
your captain and student body are de
pending on you to uphold the honor of 
the school and you are reported be
low average, better the school and you 
had never met. Rather harsh words 
from a coach, but it is just such con
ditions with which we must meet, and 
why not start out with a thorough un
derstanding? I know there is not a 
student in school that does not want 
good athletic teams and if possible vic
tory. The only way that such results 
can be obtained is for you to come out 
and try for the team, make the other 
fellow work just a little harder to keep 
his position. This applies to all teams

THE TARTAN.
With the opening of another school 
year, and the advent of volume num
ber two of The Tartan, is rests 
upon the Editor to briefly outline to 
the new students of the school, the 
policy of the paper; and furthermore 
to anncmnce the changes in its system 
of government to the upper classmen.
The Tartan closed last year, the 
first of its exsistence, financially 
solvent. Its popularity was unques
tioned, and this fact has been a source 
of very great pleasure to its managers. 
Criticisms had .been kindly offered, 
and received in a like manner, with the 
result that the general tone of the 
paper will be improved.
Professor Willett, of the department 
of English, has been appointed to the 
oard as adviser, and the editorial 
staff will be made up of those men 
of last years board who rendered th 
best work in the interests of the pa
per, together with others who will be 
chosen on a purely competitive basis; 
and judged by their literary ability. 
It is believed that this system will
insure The Tartan of securing the 
very ablest men in school on its staff.
The increased number of students 
has made it necessary to enlarge the 
sheet to double the size of last year in 
order that full advantage might be 
taken of the advertizing opportunities 
due to an increased circulation. This 
fact will make it possible for the 
Editor to pay a reasonable sum for all 
accepted articles.
It is hoped that lively interest will 
be shown in competing for positions on 
the board, especially by the men of 
the class of 1910.
ANNUAL CLASS CONTEST.
On Thursday afternoon, September 
19, the annual class contest will be 
held on the school campus. The 
Seniors and Juniors have undertaken 
to welcome the Plebes in a manner 
that will be extremely novel, and fur
thermore be a complete departure 
from the usual methods adopted by 
schools and colleges. As suggested by 
the director the upper-classmen will 
extend an invitation to the new men 
to partake of the roasted steer.
At 1 oclock the entire day school 
of Applied Science will assemble at 
the crest of the hill and the contests 
previously decided upon by the Juniors 
and Plebes, will take place. At the 
close of the games or contests the 
meal will be served, after which a 
huge bon-fire will be lighted and a gen
eral good time will be indulged in. 
Nirellis band will be in attendance.
If the students interest themselves 
in a manner proportionate to the in
terest shown by director and faculty 
we are assured of its being a memor
able occasion.
DIRECTOR ADDRESSES PLEBES.
On last Monday afternoon the 
members of the class of 1910 met in 
the large assembly room of the school, 
and were welcomed by Dr. Hamerschlag. He commented in his address
upon the character of men the new 
class was made up of, as shown by 
their abilities to pass the entrance re
quirements, and stated that he hoped 
to see them outstrip the record es
tablished by the upper classes. He 
advised the men not to be bookworms 
and to exercise consistently. He 
pointed out to them, how much they 
owed to the school, and asked that 
after they realized this sense of in
debtedness to support their alma 
mater and be loyal to the Tartan.
At the close of his address he in
troduced all the heads of departments, 
each of whom were vigorously applaud
ed.
OUR ATHLETIC COACH.
The Tartan is glad to announce that 
Mr. Jos. H. Thompson, the well known 
local athlete, will be on the coaching 
staff of the school this year. His 
popularity with the men is unquestion
ed and in as much he comes here with 
a record of having turned out winning 
teams, the prospect for a~ speedy ag
gregation is extremely bright. We 
trust that the student body has that 
spirit which desires and will support a 
successful athletic organization; for 
this year is the first that we have 
been able to put out a bona-fide varsity 
team, owing to the age of the school.
The outlook is promising, so dont 
be backward about helping along.
NEW APPARATUS & MACHINERY.
During the course of the summer 
the school authorities have spent a 
considerable sum of money to pur
chase some much needed machinery.
The Strength of Materials labora
tory in charge of Dr. Hokansen and 
Mr. Howard has received an 18" Long 
and Alstatter combined punch and 
shear which will be used in the con
struction of small structural shapes 
for use in the Department of Civil En
gineering. The machine will have an

individual motor, driven from the 
school power circuit. Two concrete 
mixers, a Smith and a cubical one of 
2% cubic feet capacity are being 
erected. The beam tester in the south 
west corner was designed by the 
school engineers and erected during 
the summer. This machine measures 
the force exerted on a full size struc
tural shape and the deflection can be 
easily measured at the same time.
The Electrical Department now con
tains an oscillograph, which is used 
to obtain the current or voltage wave 
of an alternating current. An Allis 
Chalmers 5 h. p. 110 volt motor, a 
General Electric 7% K. W. rotary con
verter, and a Westinghouse testing 
box are in the laboratory but are not 
yet installed. Another motor genera
tor set similar to the ones already in 
use and a 3 h. p., 60 cycle, General 
Electric Co. motor have also been re
ceived.
The Department of Physics has re
ceived a number of new Spectroscopes, 
a wave motion machine, and a variable 
resistance box with volt and ampere 
meters made by Max Kohl. This 
piece of apparatus has a very wide 
range of connection and has a capacity 
of 50 amperes.
In Machinery Hall may be found sev
eral new pieces of machinery.
A Worthington Surface Condenser, 
having a capacity of 3000 lbs. of steam 
per hour and a suriace of 450 sq. ft., 
was installed just before the close of 
school, as also was an Ingersoll Sergent two stage air compressor with an 
after cooler for cooling the compress
ed air. The Payne Automatic Engine 
has been used before and required 
some labor to clean and adjust but it 
is expected to run just as soon as 
steam can be taken from the boilers 
in the basement of the building. A 
General Electric steam turbine water 
brake which operat'" in principle 
something like the Alden dyna
mometer has also been added. The 
students in Mechanical Engineering
will also have the use of the three en
gines in the power house as soon as 
the Bessemer can be fitted with an in
dicator outlet, and are expected to be
come quite familiar with these types 
of prime movers. A booster is being 
installed in the power house for the 
purpose of raising the voltage of the 
current sent over to the Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie School.
In the Machine shop it has not been 
definitely decided what new machinery 
will be ordered but the improvements 
are expected to cost several thousand 
dollars.
Several new drawing tables have 
been purchased and are in daily use.
ON ATHLETICS.
(Continued from page 7.) 
whether foot ball, basket ball, tennis, 
base ball or track.
Just a word about foot ball, as it 
is the recreation with which we are 
dealing now. Foot ball as played up 
until 1906 required a certain amount, 
in fact put a premium, on weight and 
strength. The game as it is played 
today has established a very happy 
medium between brain and brawn. 
There is now a chance for the agile, 
quick-thinking fellow. Mention this to 
encourage the little fellow to come out 
and try for the team. Whether or 
not you make it you need the exer
cise.
Faithfulness in practice is the one 
thing that will be insisted upon. From 
a size-up of the material that has pre
sented itself for the team, it bids fair 
to be light; what we lack in weight we 
must make up in strategy, and this can 
only be accomplished through consis
tent, hard practice. We want the 
student body, whether they be appli
cants for the team or not, to come 
out and encourage those who are try
ing. If you only knew what a little 
encouragement from the side lines 
means, you would be out every after
noon.
As soon as foot ball is gotten fairly 
under way a series of cross country 
runs will be started, and I am in hopes 
that a suitable trophy will be offered 
to the winner. Pole vaulting and high 
jumping standards are being made, 
and will be ready for use in a few 
days. We want all those who are not 
trying for the foot ball team to inter
est themselves in some branch of 
athletics, and to this end we will glad
ly consult and advise with any stu
dent at any time. Make your wants 
known and we will see that they are 
properly attended to.
Athletics need no defence as the 
time given to them by the colleges of 
the country, by the business men of 
this busy community, speaks for it
self, have found that the man who 
follows athletics learns to think for 
himself and act promptly in an emer
gency. They arouse in him all his 
latent courage until he is a man every 
inch of him. The well-trained athlete 
is quick to take advantage of the mis
takes of his adversary. It gives to 
him the one thing essential in either 
business or pleasure, i. e., confidence 
in self.
Lets cultivate just such honorable 
qualities, and whether defeat or vic
tory be ours, our time will be well 
spent together, and we will be better 
prepared mentally, morally and phy
sically for lifes journey.
JOS. H. THOMPSON, Trainer.

A MONSTER BUILDING.
When It Is Completed Nothing but 
Eiffel Tower Will Surpass It. Some 
of Its Amazing Features.
Piercing the skyline of New York 
far above all the other skyscrapers of 
the downtown district the lofty Singer 
building, fast nearing completion, will 
within the current week exceed in 
height the Washington monument, 
whose solid shaft of granite rises 555 
feet above the ground. When the 
structural steel workers riveted home 
the last steel beam on Saturday before 
ending their days work the steel 
frame of thirty-six floors of the build
ing had been completed and the work
ers began their long descent of 476 
feet to the sidewalk. Eleven more 
stories remain to be built, and when 
the towering pile of steel and masonry 
is finished it will be forty-seven stories 
high and 612 feet from the sidewalk on 
Broadway to the pinnacle.
This giant skyscraper will be the 
highest occupied building in the world 
and will overtop all other existing
structures, except the Eiffel tower in 
Paris. Not one life has been lost so 
far in the construction of this fortyseven story office building, though 
countless hundreds on the streets have 
watched for days the intrepid steel 
workers swinging from beam to beam 
more than a hundred yards high in the 
air. When completed a time ball will 
drop every hour from a pole on top of 
the building, and at night the falling 
hour globe will be illuminated by three 
lights, which will play upon it con
stantly.
The foundation of this colossal 
building is set in solid bed rock ninety 
feet below the level of the sidewalk. 
On the bed rock were built caissons 
of cement. A heavy steel body laid 
over the caissons forms the underbody 
of the structure, fourteen floors of 
which comprise the main section of 
the building, from which rises the 
tower up to forty-seven stories with 
its scores of office rooms. The en
gineers say the total weight of steel 
and masonry in the tower is 18,365 
tons, while nearly 10,000 tons of steel 
have been used in the framework.
Eighteen elevators will carry the 2,500 
tenants to their offices, and one min
ute is required for the elevators to 
make the run from the sidewalk floor 
to the top of the structure. Fifteen 
thousand incandescent lights, suffi
cient, the engineers say, to light a 
town of 25,000 inhabitants, will illumi
nate the rooms and hallways for late 
office workers. Fifteen miles of pipe 
will be required for steam and water 
purposes.
An immense copper lantern will 
form the pinnacle of the building, from 
which at night a powerful searchlight 
will flash forth, furnishing a beacon 
to mariners, and will be visible for 
more than sixty miles at sea.

ELECTRICAL THEORY.
A great deal has been written in 
recent years by the advocates of the 
so-called new electrical theory, and a 
great deal of evidence has produced to 
show, that they are on the right track. 
These energetic workers have not 
been allowed to go ahead unopposed, 
as a great many distinguished phy
sicists have refused to accept their 
ideas; in fact, among the new theorists 
themselves there is a lack of harmony 
respecting the extent to which the 
new ideas are to be applied. No one 
questions, it seems, the sub-atomic 
particles, or at least negative electric 
charges, without atomic dimensions. 
The acceptance of this idea gives some 
definiteness to the conception of nega
tive electricity, but as yet no satis
factory idea of what positive elec
tricity consists nor how it is carried, 
has been offered. Starting at this 
point differences begin. Some would 
build up the entire atom of these sub
atomic particles; others say the time

for such conclusion has not yet come, 
and we should limit the discussion of 
the atom to a material particle  of 
comparatively large size. Whether 
this be built up of small particles com
mon to all elements can not yet be di^ 
cussed profitably. Others, again, re
fuse to consider the possibility of 
transmutation of the elements which 
naturally follows from the electrical 
theory of the atoms. Probably the 
most distinguished of this class of phy
sicists is Lord Kelvin, as he has never 
accepted this theory. At the recent 
meeting of the British Association he 
read a paper explaining his ideas of 
the ether, and took occasion in this 
connection to give some of his con
ceptions of electrical action. Lord 
Kelvin has abandoned his old theory 
of a fluid ether, and now suggests that 
the ether must be a solid, compressible 
substance, perfectly homogeneous 
throughout. He finds no difficulty in 
conceiving such a medium.
He also contends a velocity through 
the ether at a speed greater than that 
of light is possible, although this 
would call for a continual application 
of force. Many have assumed that 
such high velocity is inconceivable.
Regarding the electrical character of 
the atoms, it is noteworthy that Lord 
Kelvin accepts the idea of a sub
atomic negative charge. He believes 
that the atoms are then positively and 
negatively charged accordingly, as 
they are associated with more or few
er of these negativecharges, and he 
points out that we have no evidence 
proving that an integral number of 
negative charges or electrons, as he 
calls them, will always just equalize 
the positive charge of an atom. Should 
this be true, such an atom alone would 
then always be charged one way or 
the other, and could only be neutraliz
ed when associated with another atom, 
as no number of electrons alone will 
balance its charge. He suggests this 
idea to explain the diatomic gases, the 
atoms grouping together to neutralize 
their charges.Electric Review.
