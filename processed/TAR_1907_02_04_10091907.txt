Saturday Manager Thompson took 
the Tech team to Beaver Falls for 
the opening game o. the season. The 
game was hotely contested from start 
to finish, and though Geneva won by a 
score of 6 to 0, Tech has no reason to 
feel discouraged over the result.
About 4 o'clock Friday afternoon 
the faculty declared Hittner, Raphael, 
Robinson and several others were in
eligible. This was a great handicap 
to the team, as Hittner and Raphael 
would have been in the line-up. Silvernail has had little practice in run
ning, the Varsity, having been acting 
as quarterback for the Scrubs most 
of the year. Nevertheless, he did 
well and used good head work.
Geneva had played two games be
fore and showed the results of the 
practice, while Techs play, at times, 
was ragged and uneven. Tech im
proved during the game, and during 
the second half, kept the ball in Gen
eva's territory. Taking the game as 
a whole it was a defeat that was of 
great value to the team.
The only sensational play was made 
by Brown, who got around lechs left 
end and carried the ball 35 yards, 
making the only touchdown of the 
game.
Other men who did well for Gen
eva were Walder, Wylie, Sterrett and 
Brown.
For Tech, Beeken played a star 
game, and unquestionably is entitled 
to the honors. Roura, Dowling and 
Urling did well, and played together 
nicely, although Dowling missed a 
couple of punts he should have had. 
Marshall proved himself game by 
going in with a very sore hand. Some 
time ago, he burned a hole in his 
hand with hot lead, and by playing 
showed spirit of the right kind.
With the regular men in the line-up 
next Saturday the team should make 
a good showing against Wup, pro
vided the school turns out to support 
them.
Foster kicked off at 3.30, Brown ran 
the ball back, tackled by Wagner, 
Genevas ball, on their 30-yard line. 
By straight line bucks they carried 
the ball 2, 5, 10 and 2 yards. An at
tempt at an end run was made, but 
Geneva fumbled the ball, which went 
to Tech.
Dowling carried it three yards, Ur
ling failed to make a gain and Roura 
kicked, the ball going to Geneva on 
their 28-yard line.
Geneva 21 yards in two downs, and 
was forced to kick, Dowling catching 
the punt and being downed on Techs 
25-yard line.
Dowling gained two yards through 
tackle, and Roura and Beeken made 12 
yards by an onside kick. Dowling

made on an onside kick, though 
George fell on the ball.
Geneva made five yards around 
Techs left end, failed to 'gain, and 
went six yards on a straight line 
buck. Further gains of six and five 
yards were made through the line, 
followed by eight yards in three' 
downs, and the ball went to Tech. 
Roura carried it four yards through 
center and kicked out of bounds. The 
ball brought into the field on Gen
evas 25-yard line, going to Geneva. 
After a series of short, consistent 
gains through Techs line, Brown got 
around left end, ran 35 yards and 
made a touch-down. Walker kicked 
goal.
Tech kicked to Geneva, the ball

forced to kick, Geneva's ball on her 
35-yard line.
After short gains through the line, 
Geneva was penalized i5 yards for 
holding, made seven yards through 
guard, Robinson hurt and taken out 
of the game. Hatch goes in at guard 
and Kann is shifted over to center. 
Tech gets the ball on the last play 
and is penalized five yards for offside 
play. Dowling failed to gain, Roura 
went four yards through the line, Ur
ling made two around the end. Gen
evas ballFirst down, they made 
one yard, penalized 10 yards for hold
ing second down, gained three yards, 
Tech penalized five yards for offside 
play. The next three downs gave 
Geneva 5, 4 and nothing, the ball
went to Tech.
First down, Wink gains five yards

second downs, no gains, Tech kicks 
and Geneva returns to Dowling. Techs 
ball on Genevas 20-yard line. In two 
successive line plunges, Roura made 
six and four yards. -Urling went 
through the line for eight yards, but 
Geneva stiffened and did not give an 
inch after that. Tech tried the line 
bucks that had proved so successful, 
but failed to gain and Geneva took 
the ball on her seven-yard line, when 
a touchdown seemed certain.

First down, Geneva kicked and 
Tech took the ball. As time was 
nearly up line bucks, though sure,

was promptly downed by vVagner. 
Geneva gained five yards and kicked 
30 yards. Roura returned it 40 yards, 
gaining 10 on the exchange of kicks,

...................... ..............................................................gRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FUTURE 
APPLICATION OF CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS *
 BY D. S. BROWN-------- g
Ine following is an abstract of pa
per presented at Dayton meeting of 
Ohio Society Mechanical, Electrical 
and Steam Engineers:
The triumph of little things over 
the mighty can be shown throughout 
history in many notable examples. 
Nearly fifty years ago a great hulk of 
a monster of the sea clad in heavy 
mail was checked in its career of de
struction and put to rout by a tiny 
craft sarcastically dubbed a cheese 
box on a shingle. We can find a par
allel example in the engineering world 
of the present day.
. For a generation engineers have 
pointed with pride to the achieve
ments of high-duty, water-works pumping-engines as being the best exam
ples in steam power efficiency, but 
to-day a tiny opponent has arisen to 
dispute their claims and establish a 
new mark in the engineering world. 
We all remember with what awe and 
(fascination we have gazed on the 
great, triple-expansion, condensing, 
pumping engines designed by such 
men as Leavitt and Allis, with their 
intricate maze of polished parts 
moving with sedate precision and im
pressing one with a sense of irre
sistible power. What wonder then if 
we look with incredulity, if not con
tempt, on a small cylindrical affair 
with no moving valves, or visible rods 
and cranks, which we are told is a 
pump whose capacity equals that of 
the vast machine upon which we 
gaze with pride and awe.
But the world moves on, and its 
motion is rotative. So the engineer
ing world is abandoning the recipro
cating principle which has side-track
ed steam engineering for a hundred 
years and is going back to the rotary 
type of over two thousand years ago. 
Just as surely as the steam turbine 
is destined to replace the reciprocat
ing engine, the centrifugal pump will 
displace the reciprocating type for all 
purposes. Let us, therefore, look into 
this centrifugal pump proposition a 
little more closely.
We find that the centrifugal pump
presents a problem concerning wrhich 
there is a scarcity of published infor
mation. Probably no other machine 
in general use has less tabulated data 
regarding it in general circulation, 
and its design and the uses to which 
it may be put are more unknown to 
the ordinary engine. When your 
worthy secretary invited me to prepare 
this, paper I set to won., to accumulate 
some of the published data on cen
trifugal pumps, and* turned at once 
to the Encyclopedia Americana, a set 
of which was at hand, I found the 
subject dismissed with a brief para
graph devoted mainly to centrifugal 
machines, the closing sentence in
forming me, Cream is now com
monly separated from milk by the 
same method. See butter.
It may be wondered why a problem 
presenting so many interesting pos
sibilities should have been so univer
sally neglected. The reason, how
ever, is doubtless due to the fact that 
the centrifugal pump, like 'the steam 
turbine, was abandoned in tavor of a 
reciprocating machine before it had 
been thoroughly developed because 
the principles of its action were not 
clearly understood. In fact, even at 
the present time, when the subject 
has been given the careful thought 
and attention of many capable engi
neers, results or non-results obtained, 
from using a centrifugal pump have 
baffled the inventor and the user alike 
and brought them to the conclusion 
reached by John Richards in his es
say on centrifugal pumps wherein he 
states, These pumps are a class of 
machines that defy the mathematician 
and, as lan old workman once re
marked, have more tricks than a cir
cus mule. Thus it will be seen what 
an unsatisfactory state of affairs has 
existed in that a technical subject 
has been dealt with more cr less empyrically. However, it has now been 
put on a more theoretical basis.
Let us look for a moment at the 
work of the earliest experimenters 
with this type of machine, who have
really paved the way for the presentday pump.
The centrifugal pump was used as 
early as the latter part of the seven
teenth century for lifting liquids. Its 
gradual development is probably 
known to most engineers of the pres
ent day who have given the subject 
any thought. Dennis Papin, a famous 
French engineer, designed his Hes
sian Suck in 1703. It was a form of 
centrifugal pump embodying most of 
the features thought to be essential 
in the present day machine. I say 
thought to be essential because a 
recent development with which I 
shall later deal has shown a new me
chanical principle which has shown 
a radical departure from the conven
tional design. After Papin, the idea 
does not seem to have further devel
oped until 1818, when the Massachu
setts pump was brought out. This 
was the earliest prototype of the con
ventional centrifugal pump as it is 
now known. Since that time many 
improvements and changes have been 
made until to-day the centrifugal 
pump is a highly efficient machine 
adapted for a thousand different uses 
in every phase of pumping work. 
This fact is apparently still not gen
erally known. As recently as 1904 
Mr. C. H. Innes, M. A., an English 
Professor of Engineering, published 
a Treatise on the Centrifugal Pump, 
especially adapted for engineers, in 
which he makes this remarkable state
ment, The Centrifugal Pump is used 
for low lifts but it has been known to 
work economically with lifts as high 
as 98 feet. And yet pumps are built 
to-day for lifts up to 2,0<j0 feet which 
show good efficiency.
Centrifugal pumps have already 
been brought to a point where they 
are serious rivals of reciprocating 
pumps in many fields and are their 
undoubted and unquestioned superi
ors in as many more. For instance, 
where liquids containing even a small 
percentage of grit are to be handled 
the reciprocating type with its close 
sliding contacts between moving and 
stationary parts is at a great disad
vantage, and the centrifugal pump is 
is not only more efficient, but more 
durable. In fact, the centrifugal 
pump was introduced into a crowded 
pump field by such phases as effi
ciency, durability and simplicity, long

but they tasted good. We feel sure 
that this dance has done more to

Imitation.
The Japanese have been noted for 
centuries as a people who are very 
clever in imitation. No better proof 
of this could have been offered than 
that of last week in the machine shop 
when Mr. Hamilton was instructing 
Huroki, the representative of the
flowery kingdom in our Plebe class, 
in the method oi chipping. Mr. Ham
ilton was pounding vigorously, when 
his attention was called to something 
across the shop, and' to say his ham
mer bounded off the chisel and hit 
his thumb. The hammer and chisel 
were given to Huroki, who made a 
few strokes and then off bounced the 
hammer and hit his thumb. There is 
some question in the minds of the 
spectators as to whether this was an 
accident or a clever bit of imitation 
on the Japs part.

ONE TOO MANY.
A lawyer died in a provincial town, 
and his fellow lawyers wrote over his 
grave, Here lies a lawyer and an 
honest man. Not long after the gov
ernor of the province visited the town, 
and among other places inspected the 
cemetery. When he came to the law
yers grave he stopped, read the in
scription once or twice, and, turning 
to the head inspector, said: Look 
here, my friend. We wink at a good 
many things in this province, but I do 
object to your burying two men in 
one grave.Argonaut.

TAFT.
When I was in Washington re
cently, said a well-known Portland 
man, I was honored with an invita
tion to a dinner at which a number of 
Senators, members of the Cabinet, and 
other prominent public men were 
present. Among them was Secretary
of War Taft, who naturally came in 
for a great deal of good-natured 
joshing.
In the crowd was one person who 
is on very good terms with him, both 
personally and politically, and who is 
also an irrepressible joker. Just as 
the party was sitting down at the ta-1 
ble, this man, who was alongside I 
Taft, slipped an opera hat on the 
chair so that the corpulent Secretary 
would sit on it. The signal was given 
and they all sat down. With sur
prising celerity, however, Taft sprang 
up and held up to view the flattened 
hat.
 Gentlemen, shouted the perpe-1 
trator of the joke, I call your attention to this incident. Taft has been 1 
sitting on another lid. He has the 
j habit.
 Gentlemen, replied the Secretary, 
when the roar of laughter subsided, 
I call your attention to a still more 
important part of this incident. See, j 
he said, snapping the flattened hat up 
to its height, the lid is not broken; I 
Im losing weight. Pacific Monthly.-------o-------
BOUND TO STOP THEN.
In a suit lately tried in a Maryland 
court, the plaintiff had testified that 
his financial position had always been 
a good one. The opposing counsel 
took him in hand for cross-examina
tion and undertook to break down his 
testimony upon this point.
Have you ever been bankrupt? 
asked the counsel.
I have not.
Now, be careful, admonished the 
lawyer, with raised finger. Did you 
ever stop payment?
Yes.

ADDRESS
 BY PROF. SCHUSTER
v.vvvC<<XOOC:>OC>vOOOOOOO.OO<^
The following are excerpts from the 
address by Prof. Schuster at the open
ing of the Manchester, England, Tech
nical School:
What shall be our ideal of an ef
ficient university education? I find 
some difficulty in defining exactly what 
university education is, for one is al
ways tempted to start from a criticism 
of the present situation which leads 
only to a negative conclusion, and 
drawing attention to weak spots 
tempts one to be satisfied with a 
declaration of what university educa
tion ought not to be. Briefly speak
ing, one may say that a university 
ought to prepare the student for his 
business life. It ought to be the inter
mediate step between school educa
tion and real life, and its methods 
therefore must be such as gradually 
to lead up during three years of resi
dence to a course of study which in its 
final stage ihould in its nature and 
conditions, resemble as nearly as pos
sible, those of real life. At school 
there is necessarily a great deal of 
drudgery which has its own value and
which is indispensable in the initial 
stages of every subject. Having at 
school become acquainted chiefly with 
the drudgery of work, the university 
ought gradually to teach you the 
pleasure of workwork not for the 
sake of the reward, not for the sake of 
material advantage, but work simply 
for the pleasure of work. Drudgery 
there still will be, but it will be over
shadowed by the feeling of satisfac
tion accompanying the surmounting of 
difficulties which you will have learn
ed to consider as necessary preliminar
ies to success. You may depend upon 
it that the course of your future 
career will depend on whether you 
start your business in lifewhatever 
that business may bewith the deter
mination that your whole heart and 
soul shall be in your work, and that 
distractions and recreations shall only 
be accessory pleasures necessary to 
health, and satisfying a wholesome de
sire for a little variety of occupation. 
It is a fatal defect in English life 
which has handicapped this country 
severely in its industrial competition 
with foreign nations, that our young 
men so often look upon their work 
merely as a means of earning a liv
ing while their chief interests lie else
where. It is the business of the uni
versity to stimulate in its students the 
ideals which I have briefly sketched 
out but which contain almost the 
whole philosophy of a true education. 
There is nothing new in this; teachers 
and professors have tried ior years to 
work in the right direction but have 
failed to a great extent. It is my 
chief object today to point to one 
cause of this failure. Its nature is 
well and pathetically expressed in an 
almost despairing letter of Henry Sidgwick, published in the account of his 
life which has recently appeared. I 
quote one passage of the letter in full. 
I will not be absolutely certain it is in 
the form of a letter but I should like 
to read it to you.
The question that interests me 
most in my educational arrangements 
is this; shall I, or shall I not, succeed 
in my efforts to adapt professional 
teaching to an age in which reading is 
the ordinary way of receiving instruc
tion? According to my views the uni
versity professor should no longer, as 
of old, make it his business to give 
the first exposition of his subjecthe 
should assume that is given by books, 
his function should be to give the sec
ond exposition which all ordinary stu
dents need from their incomplete un
derstanding of the first, to solve the 
difficulties and perplexities which the 
perusal of the books has left or raised* 
in the readers mind. A lecture has 
the great disadvantage as compared 
with a book, that the student cannot 
pause and think over what is difficult, 
cannot turn back and compare one 
statement with another; it ought to 
have the great advantage that it can 
be adapted to the special needs of the 
lecturers. But then, in order that this 
advantage ' may be gained the class 
must put questions to the teacher, and 
here is where my efforts so far seem 
to fail; my class will not question me. 
In vain I assure them that I shall be 
grateful for the most vague statement 
of difficulty, doubt, or disagreement 
connected with my methods of Ethics. 
I select chapters for discussion, and 
say, Tell me if you like, merely that 
you dont see the exact drift of par. 2 
or of page 47, etc. But so far I can
not get them to do this and I do not 
exactly know why.
I think the reason of the difficulty 
encountered by Henry Sidgwick is to 
be found in the circumstance that 
the student while attending a lecture, 
has his mind too much preoccupied by 
the prospect of the examination which 
is before him. He thinks more of 
how he is to reproduce the lecturers 
arguments if he is asked questions 
about them. He has no time to clear 
up doubts, to follow up his own ideas, 
or to master the detail of his subject. 
The examination on which so much of 
his future is to depend is always be
fore him; its anticipation prevents 
the keen enjoyment of learning, and 
deprives him of much of the real 
benefit of his study. The rem
edy lies in diminishing the import
ance of the examination as regards its 
market value for future employment, 
and in securing a period of post
graduate study. Let us from the be
ginning draw a distinction between 
the two functions of higher education, 
which we must clearly separate in our 
discussions, if we wish to avoid mental 
confusion. I refer to the acquisition 
of knowledge and the acquisition of 
the power of utilising that knowledge. 
In active life it is much more import
ant that we should utilize our knowl
edge, or more often even someone 
elses knowledge, than that we should

possess a large store of facts and 
theories which are not ready lor use. 
A student to become a useful member 
of an industrial community must learn 
how to use books of reference. If he 
has acquired some facility in finding 
out what he wants, the powers of 
memory which are the powers which 
our present school education principal
ly develops, fall entirely into the back
ground. I do not wish to underrate 
the acquisition of knowledge for its 
own sake; a certain amount of it is 
absolutely necessary, but where  uni
versities have failed to a great extent 
is in laying too much stress on this 
one side of education, with the result 
that when the student is suddenly 
thrown into the world, he does not 
know how to fit that knowledge to its 
proper uses. The root of the difficulty 
which has hitherto sterilized all at
tempts at reform and prevented a 
proper fertilization of many genuine 
efforts, consists in the impossibility of 
applying an adequate examination test 
to the power of adapting knowledge to 
every day requirements. If we try to 
invent some process by means of 
which this could be done, we should 
at once defeat our own ends and put 
ourselves in the position of one who 
believes that he can teach the game 
of chess by imparting practice in the 
solution of chess problems. Let us 
acknowledge frankly that we cannot 
examine in what is most useful to 
the student in after life, let us then 
leave it outside the examination test 
altogether, but at the same time, let 
us not omit to teach it. But if the ex
amination comes at the end of the uni
versity course, and if it is of para
mount importance that the examina
tion should be passed and passed well, 
how can we prevent the student con
centrating his mind on that which for 
the moment seems most urgent to 
him? Something no doubt can be 
done to lighten his courses so as to 
leave more time for independent read
ing, for at present the student's day
is too much filled up with lectures and 
laboratory work, leaving no leisure for 
the proper digestion of the mental 
food. I am not criticising your pres
ent courses for which 1 am in part 
responsible, but I am criticising the 
circumstances which rendered the
drawing up of these courses necessary.
Starting with the knowledge which 
the average student at present pos
sesses, I do not think that much can 
be omitted from the present courses. 
It would therefore be necessary if we 
extend the aims of a complete uni
versity education to lengthen the
period of study by an additional year. 
This would involve additional expense 
and delay the time when a young man 
can stand on his own legs. But a 
lengthening of the course will become 
necessary unless a serious advance is 
made in the preliminary training 
which a boy receives before entering 
the university. If we pick out our 
best students much may be done even 
now by compressing the mam ex
amination work into the first two
years of his present course; he then 
has his third year entirely free to 
prepare himself for the real business 
of life, and during that year he will 
be free from the anxiety which un
doubtedly at present stops the spread 
of the true spirit of learning. I am 
trying at the present moment in the 
Physics Honour School a new scheme 
in which a student may pass tne bulk 
of his examinations at the end of his 
second year. If that part of the ex
amination is passed, the student un
derstands that his degree is assured 
to him. This plan, which I believe 
will answer well in the subject in 
which it has been introduced, is prob
ably not suited to the branches of 
applied science, in which in addition 
to the foundations of pure science, a 
student requires a considerable 
amount of technical training. In these 
cases a fourth year I feel sure will 
become necessary, and we should en
deavor gradually to introduce the foun
dation of post-graduate scholarships 
which will give the required opportuni
ties at any rate to our best students.
I wish that the City Council, which 
has already done so much for you, 
could be induced to secure an addi
tional claim on your gratitude by 
founding a few of these post-graduate 
scholaj^hips, which would enable the 
best students to stay another year af
ter having taken their degreea year 
which they need not necessarily spend 
entirely in this building. The post
graduate scholar might witn advant
age begin with a few months spent in 
works, where he will no doubt begin 
to realize his deficiences and see the 
necessity for further study. I know 
that students who have been enabled 
to stay for a year after graduation ap
preciate the advantage, because such 
students have frequently come to me 
saying that they have learned more in 
the fourth year than in all the other 
three years put together. 1 believe 
this is true, chiefly because the fourth 
year was in their case entirely freed 
from all anxiety as to the passing of 
an examination. They thus were put 
in a position in which it was possible 
to work for the sake of work only.
I have hitherto spoken of what may 
be called the education within the 
faculty, but a liberal university educa
tion should not confine itself to this 
portion only. The most successful 
universities at all times and in all 
countries have been those which have 
spread their range of subjects as wide 
as possible, and have brought students 
with widely different interests into 
close contact with each other. The 
advantage thus gained, is one wnicn 
leaves its mark on character, not only 
in a general way but more particular
ly intercourse between students hav
ing different interests, develops that 
side of the character which is most 
helpful to success in commercial and 
industrial life. It is for this reason 
that I am opposed to technical uni
versities as separate institutions, and 
should like to see a close connection 
between our technological and other 
faculties.
I have told you that a university 
ought to prepare men for business life, 
b'iit it cannot be denied that a mans

success depends greatly upon his 
power of dealing with other men. He 
must know how to put himself into 
another man's place, how to appreciate 
arguments which may at first sight not 
be congenial to him, how to be tolerant 
of the opinion of others, and should 
understand how matters which to him 
are of no interest whatever, complete
ly absorb the interest of others who 
are not below him in the scale of in
telligence. To some a general sym
pathy with other people's opinions 
comes naturally, but in every case it 
may be developed, and in it should be 
developed by a proper university train
ing. It is for this reason that we must 
encourage students of different facul
ties to mix in athletic sports, debat
ing societies, and all similar accessor
ies of a student's life. The mutual in
fluence which will thus be secured is, 
in my opinion, one of the important 
functions of a university, it is one 
which may not altogether be easy to 
attain where the courses of study are 
full to the brim, but it is one which 
we must continuously bear in mind if 
we are to approach our ideals.
In conclusion, I should like to ad
dress you upon the importance of feel
ing a certain sense of loyalty, and a 
certain sense of gratitude to the vari
ous bodies with which you are brought 
into contact. In the first instance you 
ought to feel and throughout your life 
continue to feel, a strong loyalty to 
this School of Technology. Loyalty is 
a thing very much akin to patriotism, 
and there are different kinds of loyalty, 
just as there are different kinds of 
patriotism. But there is one kind of 
patriotism which can thrive without 
necessarily thirstng for the blood of 
other nations; it is that kind of patriot
ism and loyalty which I wish you to 
possess for this school. You may be 
loyal to the school without being dis
loyal to the university. You should 
therefore also foster loyalty to the 
university. I do not think there need 
be any fear in this respect, because 
there is perhaps nothing which arouses 
more strongly the feeling of gratitude
than the debt a man owes to his own 
university.
Proceeding from the narrower to the 
wider sphere and having extended our 
range of patriotism from the school 
to the university as a whole, we may 
proceed a step further and unite in 
our regard for the City of Manchester. 
The city has put up this building for j 
you, and has opened its doors for 
your benefit. The City Council has j 
been subjected to some criticism on ac
count of the expense incurred in ereccj 
ing buildings which add to the dignity 
of their surroundings. I believe there 
is no money better employed than 
that spent on the improvement of the 
appearance of a town, or on something 
which can add to our regard for clean
liness and beauty. I feel quite sure, 
and I have recently had a direct 
demonstration of it, that work which 
is done in bright and pleasant rooms 
will always be very much better than 
that done in dingy surroundings where 
you cannot feel the same pleasure in 
work. There is indeed much in this 
city which may fill its citizens with 
a just feeling of pride. If you enter 
our Town Halland I hope that every 
student will make frequent pilgrim
ages to ityou will find in the vesti
bule at the entrance, on the right and 
left, the statues of Dalton and of Joule. 
There is no city in the world that can 
put up statues at the entrance of its 
principal buildings of two men of equal 
eminence. I hope every student look
ing at these memorials will receive inj 
spiration for his work, that he will 
feel proud to belong to Manchester, 
but that he will also feel his own re
sponsibilities and form a resolution 
that he will do something, even if in 
a small measure, to add to the reputa
tion of our town, of our university, and j 
of this school.

since grown hackneyed to tne pur
chaser. Many times has he, lured by 
these enticing words, which seemed 
to open up that golden prospect where 
the steam pump ceased from troubling 
and the repair man was at rest, in
vested to his sorrow. Those circus 
mule tricks previously referred to 
have led him to prefer the leaky, 
pounding, rattling, inefficient steam 
pump, which at least gave him some 
water to the new machine, which 
usually balked at the critical moment. 
The business has passed that stage, 
however, and the fact has been proven 
that the centrifugal really has the 
advantage claimed for it over the 
steam pump. It is certainly more ef
ficient and even a cursory examina
tion of its construction reveals the 
fact that it must be more durable, 
since it is certainly simpler.
Even the most sanguine centrifu
gal pump manufacturer will not deny 
that at present there are many places 
where the steam pump reigns su
preme, all things being considered, 
and that the centrifugal is at a great 
disadvantage, but there are many more 
places where the centrifugal more 
than holds its own and is slowly but 
surely encroaching on the steam 
pump's stronghold and gradually forc
ing it to the limbo of forgotten things.
I trust that the Society will pardon 
me if at various points in this paper 
I draw more or less on my own ex
perience for concrete illustrations, but 
it will be realized that they are the 
ones I am most familiar with, and con
sequently better able to discuss.
Most engineers are familiar with 
the big dredging pumps now in use for 
handling enormous quantities of sand 
and mud. No more economical form 
of handling can be conceived. From 
25 to 40% sand is moved with ease, 
and continuously, and little power is 
used in proportion to the work accom
plished. The pumps occupy little 
space and, comparatively speaking, 
their weight is small. They are gen
erally lined with steel in the form of 
liners that can be quickly and easily 
replaced, thus giving them a long life. 
Their tremendous suction power also 
enables them to work easily in fairly 
deep water.
In taking care of sewage also the 
centrifugal pump holds a firm place. 
The pump can be submerged in the 
sewage with shaft extending above to 
couple direct, or by gear, to an elec
tric motor or steam engine. These 
pumps are generally designed to work 
automatically when electrically driven, 
the motor being started and stopped 
through the action of a float-switch 
governed by a float in the pump-well 
This eliminates the attendant neces
sary where a steam pump is used, cut
ting down the maintenance cost, and 
it makes the most economical unit
procurable, since the outfit runs only 
just when it is needed, and stops cn 
the instant that its work has been 
performed. Such an outfit, which may 
be taken as a representative one, has 
been installed by the Dayton Hydraul
ic Machinery Company for the city of 
Dayton in a pumping station built for 
the purpose which has been in suc
cessful operation now for over a year. 
The installation consists of two verti
cal submerged 8-in. pumps having a 
combined capacity of 5,000 gallons of 
sewage per minute. These pumps 
are located at the bottom of a well 22 
feet deep in which the sewage and 
back water from the river is collect
ed. They are driven through bevel 
gears by Westinghouse horizontal in
duction . motors. - They discharge 
through a manifold directly into the 
river. The pumps are automatically 
governed by a float actuating a hy
draulic starter, which works abso
lutely, no attendant being maintained 
at the station. This hydraulic start
er is a most ingenious one for operat
ing with thealternating current and 
has given excellent results. The 
equipment forms a very representa
tive municipal installation.
For irrigation service, the centrifu
gal pump supplies a definite demand 
among farmers. Belted to a gasoline 
engine and pumping into pipe lines 
distributed over the fields in which 
sprays are inserted, the centrifugal 
pump is a boon to the truck-farmer, 
allowing crops to be raised on other
wise unproductive land. On a larger 
scale, centrifugal pumps of enormous 
capacity have been used for irrigation, 
watering whole acres of desert land 
by methods which only the centrifugal 
pump has made possible. I might 
mention here several such pumps in 
irrigation service at the Dale Stock 
Farm, Montana. These pumps which 
I had the privilege of designing, con
sist of two double 10-in. outfits, with 
a combined capacity of 6,000 gallons 
per minute, and two single outfits 
each of 3,000 gallons per minute. All 
are belted to Diesel Oil Engines, mak
ing an installation unrivaled for econ
omy of. operation. This is one isolated 
example where a steam-driven or 
power pump was out of the question 
owing to vast difficulties in the way.
The United States Reclamation 
Service is now making large use of 
centrifugal pumps for irrigation, in 
extremely large units as a rule, and

---------------------------------------------------

they have been found to be the best 
outfits procurable. These pumps must 
go into desert lands far from the ma
chine shops of civilization and only 
the simple and easily repaired ma
chine can be used. Irrigation prob
lems are solved by these pumps which 
permit of no other known solution. 
The fact that the Government, well 
known for its exacting requirements, 
prefers these pumps, is a certain 
guarantee of their value and superior
ity.
Again, the brewer finds the centrif
ugal pump valuable in his work. Brew
eries are, as a rule, models of clean
liness, and no other pumping machine 
is so easily accessible, or so easily 
cleaned, as a centrifugal pump. Its 
comparative noiselessness when in 
operation also commends it. There 
is installed in the N. Thomas Brewery 
at Dayton a 4-in. Brooks pump which 
raises 280 barrels of hot beer and hops 
direct from the brew-kettle to the 
hop-jack, a height of 65 feet in 25 
minutes. It replaced a well-known 
make of rotary pump, common in 
breweries, which took nearly an hour 
to do the same work and was con
stantly requiring repairs. Its opera
tion made such a terrific noise that 
conversation was utterly impossible 
in its vicinity. As a contrast, the 
Brooks pump does the work in half 
the time, comparatively noiselessly, 
and, though it has now been in oper
ation considerably over a year, has 
never had any repairs. For cleaning 
it, this pump has a large drain placed 
at the lowest point so that steam can 
be blown through at intervals, keep
ing the interior sweet and clean.
The National Board of Underwrit
ers, a most conservative body, has 
now under way the preparation of 
specifications for the use of centrifu
gal pumps for fire-service in factories 
and mills, and we will shortly see 
these pumps replacing the heavy, 
cumbersome, unreliable steam duplex 
fire pumps hitherto used. As an in
stance of the economy of space com
bined with high efficiency which the 
centrifugal pump possesses we might 
mention the three-stage, one-thousand 
gallon pump now being built for the 
American Ship-Building Company to 
be installed on board a large lake 
boat for maintaining a fire pressure 
in their sprinkling system. This 
pump is to be driven by a 150 horse
power Kerr steam turbine, making a 
most compact outfit.
A newer application of centrifugal 
pumps is in connection with a vacu
um-cleaning system for cleaning car
pets, rugs, etc. Several of these out
fits have been completed for a wellknown New York firm. The pump 
used is a 120-gallon machine directconnected to an electric motor. A 
minimum space is secured by screw
ing the pump impeller on the motor 
shaft which is extended for the pur
pose. This makes a most compact 
and efficient outfit. The pump draws 
water from a small tank and dis
charges through a nozzle into the 
same tank. One opening from the 
nozzle is attached to a cylindrical 
drum in which a vacuum of from 27.5 
to 28-in. of mercury is produced. From 
this drum a hose leads to the sweepers 
and the dust taken from the carpets 
is collected in the drum. 1 he entire 
outfit is so small and light that there 
is no doubt it will soon supersede the 
old-fashioned air-pump driven by a 
heavy gasoline engine, now a familiar 
sight on our streets.
I have recently designed and now 
am having built a Brooks pump for 
handling a saturated solution of chlor
ine which is at a temperature of 60 
deg. C. This pump will be so built 
as to have every part coming in con
tact with the liquor covered with 
hard rubber. There is every indicaI 
tion that the experiment will prove a ! 
complete success, and if so, the easy, J 
economical and satisfactory handling 
of all acids and acid liquors which at
tack iron or composition metals will 
be assured. A concern in Germany is 
also perfecting a pump built entirely 
of stoneware for the same purpose, 
which they claim is proving success
ful. Our Company also has under 
way the lining of Brooks pumps with 
porcelain enamel to serve the same ! 
purpose.
One of the latest innovations of the 
same company is a centrifugal pump 
lined with carborundum. This pump 
will prove invaluable for handling 
sand, gravel and similar gritty ma
terials. Probably the first applica
tion of it will be in the Florida phos
phate districts handling the phosphate 
rock, which is probably one of the 
most difficult substances known to 
pump, since it is almost as hard as 
a diamond.

ITEMS OF TECHNICAL INTEREST.
The number of railroad cars in the 
United States lighted by electricity 
generated by a dynamo driven by belt 
or chain from one of the axles is in
creasing. According to the Electrical 
Review, although it is generally un
derstood to be poor practice to drill 
holes in the car axle when applying 
such equipment, the positive danger 
of doing so is apparently not recog
nized. It is well known that a drilled 
hole will prevent the spreading of an 
incipient crack, and is often employ
ed for that purpose, but it is not so 
well known that sometimes a crack 
will be started by a drilled hole. 
Cracks may be expected to appear in 
any material subject to alternating 
stresses, at nlaces where there is an 
abrupt change of section, or where a 
notch or groove has been made by a 
cutting tool in a turned surface.
Locomotive engineers have for 
years recognized the importance of 
these details and their influence on 
the life of both cranked and plain 
axles. In two car axles recently frac
tured the break occurred through the 
center of shallow drilled holes, the 
first after running 15,380 miles and 
the second after 13,900 miles. The 
diameter of the axle at the fracture 
was in each case 3^4 inches. The 
cracks occurred several inches from 
the keyseats, and at points where the 
stress would not be a maximum. The 
drilled hole was made to receive the 
point of a set screw to prevent end
wise motion of a chain wheel. The 
lesson taught from these two cases 
has resulted in the use of pairs of 
clamped plates gripping the axle and 
bolted to one another, in place of the 
set screws. Shafts or axles which 
have been drilled for set screws or 
other purposes should be carefully in
spected periodically, to disclose the 
presence of cracks as soon as they 
appear.
continue business find the old mains 
and pipes a valuable asset. For ex
ample, the Columbia Gas Company of 
Hancock county, which is filling up its 
wells, gets as much as $200 for the 
pipes in one well, and mains that cost 
45 cents a foot when laid 10 years 
ago are being sold for GO cents a foot 
after all those years of service.
Dunnite, a new explosive, invented 
by Major Dunn, of the Ordnance 
Corps, U. S. A., is said to be more 
powerful than sliimose, the explosive 
with which the Japanese did such 
terrific execution in the naval battles 
off Port Arthur and Vladivostock and 
in the Sea of Japan. Sliimose, ord
nance officers say, is a compound of 
picric acid, the secret of which is 
known to the ordnance officers of all 
the first-class powers. On the other 
hand, the secret of dunnite is in the 
exclusive possession of the United 
States Government. In recent tests 
of dunnite at Sandy Hook it is said 
that the very best 5 and 6-inch armor 
plates that could be obtained were 
used as targets. The result of every 
shot was the same. The armor plate 
was smashed into thousands of small 
pieces by the impact. Penetration is 
not necessary, the impact being such 
that the armor is shattered into 
countless pieces.
Since -the exhaustion of the natural 
gas supply in Indiana for use in a 
large way it has continued to be the 
domestic fuel for the smaller towns, 
especially those in the heart of the 
gas fields, and it has supplied the 
smaller factories in the gas belt and 
is still supplying them. However, the 
wells are continuing to give out and 
the supply to become constantly 
smaller. Companies that have to dis
On the French Government canals 
near Douai, electric haulage has been 
practiced for some time. The canals 
are about 63 feet wide and 7 or 8 feet 
deep. The barges are i7 feet long,
16 feet wide, and carry 290 tons at 5 
feet 10 inches draft. The ratio of 
barge section to canal (0.2, nearly), is 
very high, consequently the neces
sary tractive effort amounts to 3 
pounds per ton at 1.9 miles per hour, 
the maximum speed allowed loaded 
barges. About 35 miles of canal is 
electrically equipped, and about 90 
per cent, of the haulage over this is 
electric.
On the older parts the Denefie tri
cycle is still used. This weighs 2.5 
tons, and has an efficiency of only 42 
per cent. As part of the towpath is 
in bad condition, upsets are frequent. 
A large part of the canal is now 
equipped with 40 horse-power loco
motives running on a light railway 
track. Power is economized, for that 
required for the tractor alone is but
2 kw., as against 13 for the tricycles.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN15
The locomotives run in either direc
tion, and, there being only one track, 
they exchange barges and reverse di
rection whenever they meet. The 
towropes are fixed to towing masts, 
on the barges, which can be raised 
or lowered, to permit passing. Cur
rent is taken by a trolley from a flex
ible cable and the return circuit is 
through the rails and the canal, which 
is said to offer the better path.
I Power is now supplied from four 
small generating stations, which are 
to be supplanted by a single station 
supplying three-phase current at 
2C.OOO volts to motor generators at 
sub-stations.
 Although hard drawn copper wire 
has been declared to elongate not 
more than one per cent, without frac
ture, this is scarcely true under prac
tical testing conditions. Soft copper 
wire under increasing load has a 
steady, permanent elongation, prac
tically uniform throughout the length 
under test, until near the breaking 
point, when a local elongation takes 
place at that spot. This local elonga
tion being small in proportion to the 
total, the result is little affected by 
the length of the test piece. 'With 
hard dVawn Jwire, Uhe | increase ;of 
length is small, until the fracture 
point is reached, and the local elonga
tion forms a large percentage of the 
total. Consequently, if the elonga
tion is measured up to the actual 
fracture, the percentage is a decided 
function of the length. The test 
pieces usually are only 8 or 10 inches 
long, and the total elongation is corIrespondingly small. Therefore, al
though fairly uniform measurements 
may be obtained the readings will be 
affected by unavoidable sources of 
error, and are usually much higher 
than those obtained with the long 
specimens from the same material.
The protection of metals by plating 
with copper or other metal is occa
sionally found desirable, but often in
convenient, because of the large size 
of vat which would be necessary. An 
expedient tried with excellent results 
consists in applying the electrolyte 
with a paint brush attached to one 
pole of the source of current. A 
smooth, adherent and strong coating 
or metal may thus be built up to any 
desired thickness. The process has 
been successful in plating with silver,
gold, copper and nickel. The latter 
was found preferable for protective 
purposes, because of the low voltage 
required. Cyanide solutions were 
used for the gold and silver and sul
phate solutions for the copper and 
lickel.
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DRESS
ING ROOM.
The new cupboards for the use of 
the foot-ball candidates have been 
finished and are nearly all occupied. 
The relay men will use those not al
ready in use. Some gas stoves have 
been installed in the house, and are a 
very welcome addition. The place 
has lost its chilly aspect and is now 
a fit place to dress in. It is hoped 
that the electric lights can be connect
ed up before long, as the evenings are 
quite dark.
A LITTLE KICK.
It has come to the ears of a num
ber of the Tartan staff that the stu
dents are not entirely satisfied with 
conditions at Mr. Sharps building. 
For one' thing, and in fact the main 
objection, seems to be the soil]). It is 
good enough but one should have a 
zinc-lined threat to swallow it. The 
chef seems to think that the more 
pepper he can throw in, the better 
the soup will taste. But, alas, such 
is not the case, and if the practice is 
not abated he may have the horrible 
punishment of eating his own soup 
imposed upon him.

THE BRANCH LIBRARY.
The new branch of the Carnegie 
Library which has been opened in the 
school buildings is not being patron
ized as well as it might be. Is is 
true that it is located in a place a 
little out of the way of the students, 
i but a visit to the room will repay 
any and all who take the trouble to 
do so. Mr. Hirschberg. the librarian 
in charge, will do all he can to assist 
students in the choice of books. He 
has had a long experience in this line 
of work, and can pick out the suitable 
book if the students will only consult 
him on the subject in which they de
sire information.

DRIVING A SPIKE UNDER 
WATER.
It is sometimes necessary, says thj: 
Iron Age, to drive a spike under water, 
and much difficulty is experienced in the 
operation. It has been suggested that a 
piece of gas pipe large enough to 
hold the spike comfortably, and small 
enough to keep it upright, might be 
used in conjunction with a steel drift 
slightly longer than the pipe. The 
length of the pipe will depend upon the 
depth of the water, while the drift 
should leave a hand-hold above the 
pipe. By means of this expedient nails 
can be driven in several feet of water, 
and at any angle desired, as the spike 
will necessarily go at the angle at which 
the pipe is held, and the drift readily 
transmits the hammer blows to its head. 
This has been found a great help in 
building bottoms for foundations.
