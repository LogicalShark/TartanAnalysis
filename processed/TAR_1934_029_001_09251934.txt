Many traditions may bring beautiful thoughts-and have stainlss histories, while .others harbor tbe well known skeleton In the closet. Ohio State, of course, has a Junior Prom and a Senior Prom. I do not feel that I am telling stories out of school when I say that Ohio State
'social1' attended the proms. Last year the management of the Juulor Prom was given to the Junior honoraries and that of the Senior Prom to the 6enlor honoraries. Both proms were outstanding social and financial successes, and we are hoping that the tradition, which has started will continue.Spring and May bring with them
lophomores are awakened by bucket of water. This Is to 1 them know that they are initiates of the junior men's honorary society; the Bucket and Dipper.

A Note of Welcome
I am happy to liave the opportunity afforded 
me by the Carnegie Tartan to extend to you a 
word of welcome to the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. Your entering college. is prob
ably the most Important step that you bave 
taken. I hope you are going to have a moat 
satisfactoryyear In the realization of your 
hopes and ambitions. You have .years of bard 
work ahead of you, but 1 am sure you will find 
the members of the faculty friendly and anx
ious to help you with any difficulties which 
: may arise. Do not hesitate to ask their coun
sel. I shall be glad to see you at any time that 
you may desire to discuss your problems with
THOMAS S. BAKER, President.
Three Points
Considering the abyndance of advice that 
has been given the freshmen during the last
 tew days it Is very likely that by now they
 shall have cultivated an aversion toward any 
^more of it. Since too much of anything be^ 'comes tiresome, we hcstitate, for an instant, 
to. add our bit to the large amount of -ver
bosity that has lready been unloosed at them. 
'.Yet there ore three points that we cannot let
 pass unstressed because they pertain to three 
major phases of college.the work, the fac*
. .ulty, and the life at college. '
**' it is common' for you freshmn to feel that 
' you are entering college to prepare for a ca. reer,that career to begin four years hence 
when you graduate. A more.proper attitude 
for you to tak^ Is that that professional career 
begins right now. The process of speclallzation has already begun. You are here because 
you have a particular aptitude or talent in a 
certain field. You may have excelled' In it
 in high school. Here It Is much more difficult 
to excel; The work is harder and the compe
tition is keener. You will discover that only 
when "your heart is in the work will you be 
. able to make good. Beginning now, and even 
more so four years from now, a condition will 
list wherein only the fittest survive,. This is 
th, beginning of your professional career aud 
it behooves you to be one of the fittest If you 
intend to remain In It. .
Cultivate a close relationship, with your faculty Consider them more in.the light of ad
visers Tather than' teachers; ' You will find 
them always ready to sharpen your interest,
' hear1 your ideas and consider your opinions.
. A' great deal can be gotten from your teachers outside the classroom. If you let them,
 - -th-sy-tfMJ -be', and 'VWA. to ^.. SPAVr..very^loee.
friends. They are Interested in yon and.wa;nt 
to draw out the best that Is In you. Get' into 
;_dIscussIojj.s. with them, not only concerning 
your school work but also other things of im-. 
' portance to you. It will surprise you to find 
- :how closely your interests He.' Bridge the .gap 
that existed between teacher and pup|l in high
 school. Your instructor will give you a helpIng "hand across.
t college you not only prepare for the busl'ness.ot earning a .livelihood, you also prepare 
for the business of living. There is a splendid opportunity at Carnegie for you to acquire 
~ the ^-subtle, elusive "technique of living" be'' cause of the greatly diversified type of student 
hre. Although you have one prime interest, 
.that-'particular study you are pursuing, dont 
".'become specialized to the extent that you dis* 
. regard all other interests. If you are an engijreer/.'db&'t ' neglect to read books or to cuitlyate^a. taste for, inu6ic. If you are an. architect 
':. or ai artist,dont shun all things of a scientific 
n'aturei ln other words, Increase your inter* 
it that your mind becomes more broadO'.-iejiied' and your existence becomes more round* 
y. ^e; ::LaTiito exchange viewpoints aud take 
Hmdre'than a passing interest In .'what other^ople are thinking. Dont allow yourself to 
^become restricted to, the narrow confines of 
v-.-^du:*'chief pursuit. Concentrate bn learning 
'.Htiow . to enrichyour life.
abput the pride -and faitb that her graduates 
have always held toward Carnegie.
Armbands and dinks are Imposed not to 
make freshmen look lowly, but rather to help 
promote the personal feeling among freshmen 
that they are becoming part of theclan.
There is no doubt that black bow-ties be
come surprisingly bedraggled by. Thanksgiving 
and it is surprising what dignity Is lacking Jn 
the absence of high school Insignia. It is more 
surprising to find, with the removal of regula
tions, that a certain glamour that goes with 
being a freshman is missed when dinks and 
armbands are .finally doffed.
This year, freshmen are not expected to tor
ment the sophomores or to ruffle the dignity of 
senior judges. The sophomores are ready for 
a new-act. They have thrown off the masks 
of traditional enmity.
It 1s the last word" at Carnegie to follow 
regulation^. The conspicuous law-breaker Is 
no longer in vogue. Trials will not be fash
ionable this year. Regulations, like the air 
mail, are socially correct.
In Union There Is Strength
The newly formed Association of College 
Editors is, without a doubt, the hDaDo promising 
of all the attempts to make the influence of 
the undergraduate felt 1n public affairs. The 
idea of uniting student newspapers through
out the country so that the crystallization of 
student... opinion into one significant whole 
might, be .achieved-is one indeed worthy of 
encouragement. By consolidating the wide 
j'ange of opinion that now exists an the-edi
torial pages of the college newspapers, the 
college press ceases to be a play-toy" and is 
given a far more valid justification for existIt is safe to say .that the undergraduate of 
today, having been nurtured on the doorstep 
of the depression. is fa more concerned with 
the future and his place in it than was his 
brother of 1928. He is vitally interested in na
tional affairs and policies because now, more 
thun ever, they reach home. In most cases be 
possesses strong opinions about them. If, by 
means of the A. C. E. those opinions can be 
ascertained and massed together, they might 
exert great pressure and influence on whatever 
happens in Washington. But whether they do 
or not, if the undergraduate ie made to feel 
more govemmenl-conscious. if he takes seri
ously and works for the three-fold aim of the 
association, peace, more efficient government 
and a higher standard of living, the associa
tion will have performed a valuable service.
The trend of government today is toward 
the-point where Washington shall have a 
Anger In almost everything we do. It behooves 
us lo see that that finger is an intelligent one.
Senate vs. Arms Makers
What diBtlngulshOB th Nye munitions inves
tigation from the ordinary Senate investiga
tions Is the fact that the committee has been 
able to uncover so much evidence definitely 
proving that bribery and corruption of public 
officials has taken place. Although' the inves
tigation hns heen in full swing for. thrg.eweeks, 
 grait part of the time has been'spent in 
reading into the record letters and documents 
in which the terms. 'graft," bribery, ''palmoil," "commissions, and "greasing the ways 
are used with unusual abandon.
The manufacturers who furnished these let
ters from their files had plenty of time to de
stroy them, since all Senate investigations 
are announced about six months before they 
begin, but apparently they thought that no 
disclosure, no'matter how startling, could stir 
up the public enough to affect the armament
This attitude on the part of the arms makers 
is in line with the opinion of competent ob
servers, who at the beginning of the Investiga
tion were 'unanimous in their decision that  
big furore would .be caused, but that there 
would be no tangible results.
Journalists who are versed in the ways of 
the lethargic Senate were positive that' the 
lawmakers would not go so far as to enact 
Senator Nyes proposed legislation "which will 
either place the American munitions Industry 
under strict federal regulation or create'a'gov* 
ernment monopoly for the industry.* If such 
legislation Is not enacted it Is obvious that the 
avms aikevk-'ftlH^iUln.-ue' unabated tfceliun
ethical business practices and their traffic in 
blood and lives.
However, now that-the -investigation has 
brought to light so many startling facts and 
promises to continue to do so, there is a 
. chance -that something may be accomplished in 
the . way of legislation. It would certainly 
seem: that American civilization Is in a sorry 
state If armament manufacturers are allowed 
to continue purchasing public officials, stirring 
up international fear and suspicion by starting 
rumors of war, and selling munitions to po
tential American enemies. Although the Amer
ican arms manufacturers can not be accuscd 
ofas much crookedness as the foreign mem
bers of the munitions ring, the evidence al
ready presented is sufficiently damning to war
rant making the entire munitions Industry a 
government monopoly.

lattaek which was noticeably lacking during the past 6eason. Spencers I chief warning Is speed and remarkable drive. Patt, who has excited a deal of local newspaper comment, plays like a finely adjusted machine In the quarterback position. The teams success will depend to a targe extent on the precision and quickness of this mans wit Mihm, In the half position, has added so to his usefulness of last year that ID is apparent his new placement is his natural one. His position at blocking half enables him to make full use of his weight, and from this position he can come around on reverses to pound through the weak slde'of the line. Terebus. makes up whatever he lacks In size by a very nifty running abilitytricky le .the word.

New Ball Dimensions, Regulations 
Give Offensive Edge Over Defensive
Greater Freedom Seen in 
Passing Rules; Ball ie 
Longer, Thinner
Becauee'of the fact that In the 
honorable old game of football, 
the defeuse seems not only to have 
caught up to the offense, hut In 
some ways has even passed It, the 
Rules committee has decided to .give tlie offense another chance, and has changed the shade of the official ball and made a few changes In the regulations. The' main reason for . all this feeling of benevolence toward those on the offense is the fact that under the previous rules, the olfense was primarily handicapped by the regulations concerning the well-known Pdssing attack.
Since the experiment with the old pigskin began, the dimensions and shape of the ball have been changed twice to-date.
However, the greater dimension has now been shortened so that the present hall now more closely resembles Us old self. This 'resemblance must not. be taken too seriously by asplrlng'players,. hbwe-ver, for there Is still a world of difference, and unfamiliarlty with The handling of the new ball will ptoye the downfall of many trledPfove Itself to be a boon players on the offense. Whereas, "before^ the art of passing was one "which" was cultivated and accompllshed by a comparatively small
the short as Is has only been ._' duced by one inch, any man with a medium sized hand can now pass . ??uh.a Arm grip, rather than'from a balance, such as was previously - ihe case.  
.Although the ball Is^much easier
to get off, it is also -much herder 
to receive. This being true, it will 
al9o be harder' to intercept, so that 
In the end it is really better for 
the offense, and the defense Is 
more left out in the proverbial cold.  
' Prob^iy me. main.disadvantage of the' new baty. lies In its disability - to adapt Itself to Hie' * Very good punters can. still _ off good kicks with this ball, but Jack" Buckler, star kicker of the. Army says, the best kicker in the

This is, of* course, another advantage for the offense, so it is t up to the defense to be right their toes.

Back Combination
With the first game of the sea
son only five.days away,the var
sity football team has been Anally 
rounded Into a fairly' definite unit. Strength in the backfleld is. pretty well assured, and the line-is gradually strengthening with practice.
The backfleld, as was arranged in the practice, session, consists of Patt, Mihm,' Terebus, and Spencer, Babe Pa-tt, though . only. a sophomore, is .assured /of.,,his, berth, principally through.,j,qfgVl, passing ability. . In .pr&saaspn practice, he has demonstrated.-rhis ability to throw the ball faBt'; and straight and will probably'tie one of. the keystones oC the Tartan attack, tie is also an able hall carrier though he hasn't done much of this so far. For [reserves in-this capacity Charlie Spiaak and Bill Carlson have been alternating satisfactorily, and both will probably see action during the season In relieving Patt. ' 1
Joe Mihm at outside half has been blocking well and will probably start In this capacity. He also does . some 'ball carrying and usually performs well as he Is exceptionally fast ' for bis weight. Butch Vorderberg, another blocking half, will prove above the average as a reserve In this position. Butch is tough and can block and has had much experience in this position.
Spencer .and'. Terebus . are the present .. running: combination. Spencer has recovered completely from his shoulder operation, and hla plunging has shows promise in the early season warm ups. Steve Terebus is, of course, as fast a rabbit-back as one could wish for, and in the open field Is an exceptionally hard man to tackle. Steve will probably start most of the games and. . when necessary will be ably relieved by other fast backs from the . squad. Another running combination that has looked good in practice is Lehman and Bowser. FreddyLehman is a hard running boy and tough. He shines on the'defense and may be called into action frequently in that capacity. "With Bowser, the combination looks even better as Owen is a fast lad and a tough one to' stop. In the open field his running is pretty to watch and .very effective.The line has been, doing as well as could be expected. Lib Lejris at end -has picked up considerable speed over the summer and much can he expected of him. He is still sure on pass receiving and defensive, and. barring his jinx, should be one of the mainstays'of -the 1934 team. . Goona Sanford. on the other end, though, not quite up to Libin ability , is holding down his Job satisfactorily. He looked
exceptionally good on the end 
around play, the first one to look 
that way in years. He i9 particularly well adapted to the Harpster system of attack and defense and,' Cor this reason, beat out Goodrldge who will play in a reserve capacity
t afford to let Goody go for a while as ho is one of the most dependable reserves on the squad. Burns and Moore are also doing substitute work on the ends and proven quite adequate in practice.

g anu t this year, the night school

year, has carried .no banner of Its 
ownTie various changes have 
been made with the thought in 
mind of making the Tartan a 
newspaper that would compare bet. ter than favorably with any col
lege publication throughout the 
country. That the day school staff 
lias been successful was demon
strated by. th placement of the 
Tartan among the first three colle
giate publications a short time ago 
by a group that certainly should 
. he.in a position to judge.
: However, the most recent 
! changes, details of which are dis
cussed elsewhere, on this page are 
more important and lar-reaching 
.than any that have heretofore been
 made. The privilege to express

without any regard to any other

It should be said at this time 
that the previous policies of the

Impossible to present a weekly is
sue that will contain only matters

this' reason, it is hoped that there
