Purdue Hoilermakcrs Invade Carnegie Saturday
Game To Be Feature 
Of Homecoming Week
Duane Purvis and Jim Carter, Stellar Halfbacks, 
Lead Invasion for Purdue; Tartan Lineup 
Not Definitely Decided; Odds Even
By James Hughes
The feature of the Homecoming this week-end will be the 
second annual game betwe'cn the Tortans of Carnegie and the 
Boilermakers of Purdue University. Prom all indications, this 
should be one of the best and most-evenly matched games on the 
TarUin schedule this season.
Purdue Has Reputation 
Purdue has always had one of the 
strongest outfits In the mid-west, 
and in 1929 - won the Big Ten cham
pionship. Although they liave not. 
actually won that title since, theyhave been one of the strongest con
tenders, and have furnished plenty 
of trouble for their opponents. This' 
year they are again putting up a 
very excellent battle, despite the 
loss of eight regulars and twenty lettermen.
And Grid Stars 
Although the Bollermarkers have lost such a large number of men. they still, have two men who wero probably the best and the outstanding players on their team last year.Duane Purvis and Jim Carter ave two of the greatest backs In the annals of Purdue football history.,-Purvis was considered by muny last year to be the outstanding back In the country, and was named on the All-American as halfback. He Js one of the most versatile players on the field today, and can be depended upon to do almost anything in the way of football.
Jim Carter was the leading scorer i the Purdue eleven last year, for 3 Is the type of player who cau break away at the most unexpected limes for long runs toward the. goal.His running ability was very ably demonstrated against the Tartans last year, when he made, two touchdown runB of 90 and 53 yards.
Around there two great backs.Noble Klzer has built a well-rounded team. Klzer is himself a Notre Dame man, and is claimed by many authorities in the game to be the lutstanding exponent of the Notre -Dame system.
iHave Developed Strength On the Purdue schedule are included besides the Tartans, Rice,Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Chicago,Iowa, Fordham, and Indiana. The first two of these games did not go So well as far as the Boilermaker were concerned. Rice provided one of the big upsets of the season when they knocked off Purdue by two. .touchdowns. The next week Notre Damefollowed with a win over the Boilermarkers by 18-7.,Coach Kizer seems to have done something-to strengthen the team i then, however, for they gained a fairly strong hold on the Big Ten championship this last Saturday when they defeated Wisconsin by a ore of 14-0.
By the old method of comparing scores, which doesnt prove any* thing definitely, and yet gives some Idea of what to expect, the Tartans a fairly even chancc of winning this game. Considering' that Notre Dame beat Purdue by a : which was' worse than that by which they took over the Skibos, the odds seem to be good. (However, another angle might be taken into consideration. Purdue man; aged to score on Notre Dame, while Carnegie did not. That fact may or may not mean something also.Tartan Lineup Unchanged

Tony Prendes, former star of the Malvern College team in England, now playing the center.-' forward, position of the Plaid team, was outstanding, scoring both goals for his team. ..The Tartans presented a well-coached squad, tihd with' a few more games under theii* belts should be as strong as any college eleven in the district. Captain l>ubin, Prendes, Ed Reed, former Hagerstown, Md.. High star, Corning, Giollna, Floyd, Pendleton, Lalll, Dave Higgin, Kissel, Provost, and Cutulie, played for Carnegie.

Perhaps with a little more experi
menting, Coach Howard Harpstef 
will be able to build up a team 
which will be able to function with a little more coordination and ease than it has been doing in the
ing lineup,, there will probably not be much change from that of the last game, unless some very \ pected and drastic unheavals take
under cover by wise opponents and hasnt had much chance to do anything lately, he will still be ready gain every possible Inch, i ~ gets away. Joe Mlhm can certainly be depended upon for a great display of kicking, not to mei line-bucking. .Should any need for It arise, Joe will be ready to s;game with the old booter, he has - had the opportunity, too
should develop Into a really capable player.
Since Mlhm has been shifted to the quarter position, Harpster has quite a group from which
ly good material In reserve that there should not be too much to worry about from that angle,

The rest of the half found both teams pushing back and forth near the middle of the . field.In thei third quarter Rosenthal forestalled another Pitt tbreaL when he leaped high In the air to Intercept a pass on his own twentyyard line, where the opponenls had advanced the ball on a series of end runs and line bucks.
. Fryer Stare Carnegies only serious attempt came in the fourth quarter. Fryer, vho has been playing in the backeral plays before kicking. On tho third play . Fryer eluded the Panther tackle and broke through to recover a fumble on the twenty. The Plaid did little with tho opportunity, however, and surrendered tho ball after , failing to make a first down. The .visitors kick put the game back in Tartan territory. End Run Scoi
in hot water,. Kopsak, who had been removed from the game early because of an injury, returned to the line-up, but had difficulty in getting off effective punts. Pitt finally capfter. touchdown went wide. Tartans Outclassed The outstanding Tartan player was Fryer, who went in for Dwarskl In the -third quarter and did a
r left end. The visitors star was Stapulls. The Carnegie line was noticeably' - slower on the charge, and the Carnegie tackling seemedless effective than that of Pitt. The Tartan plebes were inferior in kicking . performance. Neither team gained much distance over guard or center; both pivot men held off advances with little difficulty.

Another sad feature of the gtimo was the apparent lack of adequate Tartan reserves, in the course of the contest Layden used 40 players
shoddy with sad results. It Js the opinion of many that the Notre Dame victory of this year was as much a fluke us the Carnegie victory of last yoar. However, there was also a certain fire and flght
overcome the lead, but just trying to not let It become any largor. Mlhm at quarterback was obviously playing ter the breaks, usually

- A Stump To Stand On
T
HE P0EJC&TI03? of a discassfos grasp os 
(be campus fulfills a need that baa bees 
sadly neglected at Carnegie for a long line. 
It provides aa. open forum when* students eas 
discuss national and International affairs and 
urtve at conclusions concerning them. It 
shows definitely students ARE interested 
in current problema, that they hare opinions 
to be heard. Tills Is their stamp to stand a 
to air their views, their baltleSeld upon wLIcit 
they <^-T! wraugfe oat their tffsagTeemepf?.
Practically every eoiiege and university of 
repute [n the coon try has a group of this 
sort on tie campus. Probably the most fa
mous oi the lot arethe proud old Americas 
Whig and Cliosophic societies at Princeton 
which have been carrying os for almost 230 
years. We hope to-see the Carnegie group 
develop along the same lines. We look for 
the formation, withla the group, of two fac
tions, oner of liberal attitude and the other of 
conservative attitude, which wfn take definite 
stands' on each problem discussed. We ex
pect that the probiems to be discussed win be 
tied downto realities and not be purely hypo
thetical Questions.
Adjusting to life
S
TUDENT response to last Tuesday's edi
torial Those Who Fall by the .Wayside"
. caTta fur an amplification of the Tartan's stand 
-with respect to the Introduction of a student 
personnel advisory system at Carnegie. Many 
of the letters received, some of which appear 
on peg* 5 of this issue-, reveal a certain 
amount of misunderstanding of the Tartan's 
objectives, some anticipation of forthcoming 
.dftortal statement, as well as an encouraging 
am cum of agreement.
'Personality adjustment Is the college studeut's-greatcst problem, a problem as difficult 
-of-solution to the successful student as ft Is 
to the scholastic failure. That aa inadequate 
adjustment to this life problem reflects itself 
directly in the student's work is both a tru
ism and a definite Justification for the demand 
that the Administration shoulder frft part ot 
Its. educational responsibility.
What makes tbJ3 problem of adjustment so 
insidious is the t&ct that It can be present 
.gn<T yet the malcontent can be unaware of the 
exact nature oi his difficulty. The process of 
building a life, developlng-a personality, and 
evolving a personal philosophy Is Indeed a 
difficult one. .With so many pathways from 
whlch-to -choose inthis  complies* edage,lt-ls 
no small wonder that so many never reach the 
. broad highwayci a normal and fruitful life.
The. objection been raised that the col
lege should-sot be concerned with personal 
problems, that such rrg&tfdily belong to the 
home, the charch, and the public schools. 
Logically that 3. true. But unfortunately 
these agencies haye failed.
" " Parents very often are the CAUSE of mal
adjustments in their children rather *~han a 
sympathetic medium, forcorrectlon. Psycholo- gists rarely find a maladjusted child without 
discovering much the same sort of difficulty in 
the parents.
Public schools as an adjustment medium 
gsu* be very.largely iscounted. Not only must 
their efforts' be scattered, but personnel offi
cers, where .they are found, are generally al
most completely occupied b7 routine office de
tail 3- The church is helpful, but in the strict 
"seise It lacks the trained experts without 
 whom any personnel program must he ineffec
tive.
- It might be well to point out that the Tar
tan expects no miracles. It is obviously im
possible to pick one and only one occupation 
for a given individual, of to transform 'a" 
: - feeble minded person into an apt scholar. It 
I3 possible, though, to discover and point out 
' s field of activity to which 5' fbciTidtiai's czpalflities fit him. Guided into a compatible 
 field, the individual would then be able to 
choose that branch of endeavor which is pe
culiarly to hU Iflrfng^ Vocational  guidance, however, unould be 
- only one phase ot a personnel bureaus work.
Its principal objective must be to raise the 
' level of human happiness and effectiveness. It 
fe In this sense that the "term efficiency was 
used. Merely to increase the percentage of 
those who graduate Is not the objective ot a 
personnel advisory program. To increase the 
number of Individuals adequately adjusted to 
lifes problems is Its aim. Ia this educational 
sense; Carnegie's efficiency could be raised far 
above .what the program would cost in effort 
and In money.
Senate Supervision
T
HE CHAIRMAN of Elections, William S. 
Carlson, is to be commended cn his move 
to incorporate the college senate into the sys
tem of. conducting elections. Inasmuch as 
f class officers are not elected for oa entire 
class of the Institution but rather are elected 
separately by the classes or the various col
leges, the supervision of these elections within 
their own halls is a doty tfutt naturally falls 
upon the three college governing bodies.
This move wiE not onlyprovide duties for 
class officers that have in previous years been 
inactive but win also make for airer elections.
TfaeRi .icnlons Football Holiday
I
T become an almost established eustom of student, bodies of certain institu
tions of higher learning to celebrate a football 
victory by arbitrarily declaring a holiday from 
classes the Monday following the game end 
participating In demonstrations throughout the 
city that never fell to reflect discredit upoe 
their Institution.
A footb&n victory is s joyous event asd 
most certainly calls for celebrationperhaps 
the Saturday night of the game or even the 
following Sunday while spirits are still gay 
and excitement is running high. But thinking 
students who analyze the situation clearly and 
are not susceptible to mob psychology can 
readily see that by Monday enthusiasm has 
cooled considerably and that any demonstra
tion or celebration postponed tB then most 
obviously be forced and Insincere. It is very 
apparent tha students who resort to such 
measures to mate evident their loyalty^ to 
aim mater are merely seizing upon, a flimsy 
excuse to avoid' attending classes. Such an 
attlisde on the part of undergraduates Is sot 
only out of order but inasmuch as It Involves 
missing classes that the student himself Is 
; paying for. It becomes CTtremely ridiculous.
-The occasion cot yet arises at Carnegie 
for which such a celebration might take place, 
but if it should arise, it Is hoped that Carnegie 
men will conduct ' themselves a3 befits their

During the spring semester of

weH-meao* editorials oc the subject 
of faorganisation and activity. 
This action may or may not have

the ideals sec forth by Che former 
Tartaa editor.
The sole reason for the existence 
of these committees was tbe formu

such as picnics and dances. Th 
committees functioned perfectly
but the students happened not to be 
Idealists, and did not cooperate
with the arrangements made for

ADVISER HAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE ON CAMPUS
Dear Editor,
I read., with interest your edi
torial last week entitled Those 
Who "Fall by the Wayside; and 
while I do not agree with your as
sertion that "business-like ef
ficiency must come more strongly 
into college administration." I do 
feel that there is a definite need for 
a student personnel adviser.
A college in its very nature can
not he run with business-like ef
ficiency if it Is to progress, cannot 
really maintain high standards If 
it permits all who enter to gradu
ate. That is, of course, an opinion, 
and not of primary importance In 
the present instance.The fact remains that, whether he is to promote efficiency or not, a student'personnel adviser has an important place on a college campus. High school vocational counsellors are notably ineffective; unavoidably so, perhaps, because schools are overcrowded. Such counsellors are often teachers well, and have little time to devote to student guidance. " for the college advisers to remedy in part this failure of the high
Few" people, when they enter school, have definite Ideas as what they plan to do after leaving.
Deer Editor,There is no menial phenomenon more common taah that of simplification. Does a malpractice exist? Then someonepostulates a 6lngle cause and proposes a single emgdy. The Tartan's wholly laudable effort to propose a major change in school policy by* the tabllshment of a student personnel department seems the writer to manifestation of this human 
frailty.
The objective or the proposed official is to be, it seems, the inrease of what might be termed the
very small percentagi
 be
