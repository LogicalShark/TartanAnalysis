Scheduled To Discuss 
Religion In Education
Next week is CITs annual Re
ligious Discussion Week. The 
theme of this years discussion

Roland Davis office on the first 
floor of the Carnegie Union.
The meetings that are open for 
all students include the assembly

freshments will be served. For 
further information contact Mr. 
Frank Motter, student chairman 
of this year's Religious Discussion 
Week.
Parking Problem Solution In Sight
The end to the campus parking 
problem may be in sight.
A committee established by the 
Executive Board and composed of 
students, faculty, and members of 
the administration to study the 
situation met last week and form
ulated a three-point recommenda
tion to alleviate the ever growing 
problem.
Although the action of the com
mittee is only in the form of a 
recommendation which has not yet 
been presented to the Executive 
Board, the action demonstrates 
that the administration is fully
aware of the problem and has in
tentions to strike at its cause.
Every day, all of the campus lots 
are filled to capacity except the lot 
between the DU and TX houses. 
As soon as ground is broken for 
the industrial administration 
building, an 80 car lot will be lost 
and the situation will be further 
aggravated.
Three Point Program 
The first point of the threepoint program calls for immediate 
investigation of two sites. A park
ing lot could be built on the shelf 
above the east side of the cut, and
the space between the Schenley 
Park side of Skibo and the side
walk could be converted into 
parking stalls.
The second point drafted dur
ing last Fridays meeting was that 
as soon as sections of the FPHA 
barracks are torn down, the clear
ed space should be made availa
ble for immediate parking. So con
gestion around the Union might be 
relieved, a lot on the Beeler street 
side was recommended.
Widen Street 
Setting their sights on a long 
range program, the committee
members suggested the widening 
of the street between Fine Arts 
and Webb Hall and the construc
tion of a large turn-around in 
front of Engineering Hall. The 
street between Skibo and Admin
istration Hall would be deadended 
at the north end of AH.
Committee members represent
ing the administration are Dean 
Cleeton and Mr. Patton. Professors 
Margaret Ely, Robert Morgan, and 
Robert Schmertz are representing 
the faculty. Student representa
tives are Eugene Eisemann and 
Frank Witt.TA

Concert To Be 
Held March 24
The annual spring concert of the 
combined Men and Womens Glee 
clubs will be presented on Friday, 
March 24, at 8:15 p.m. in Carne
gie Music Hall.
One of the highlights of the eve
ning will be the performance by 
the mixed voices of Randall 
Thompsons Alleluia, which was 
composed at the request of Dr. 
Serge Koussevitzky for the open
ing exercises of the Berkshire Mu
sic Center.
French Idiom
A group of folk songs for chil
dren with the charm and naivete 
of their modern French idiom will 
lend variety to the program and 
will be sung by the Womens Glee 
club. Already winning wide ac
claim in America, these tunes 
were recently recorded by Robert 
Shaws collegiate choral. 
Younger Generation, with 
words and music by Ira Gersh
win and Aaron Copeland and tak
en from the motion picture The 
North Star, will be another un
usual number by the Womens 
Glee club, which is under the di
rection of Miss Carolyn Kennedy, 
with Elynor Bruce as student di
rector.
 . . . rich, melodic ...
Rachmaninoffs Floods of 
Spring, which illustrates the rich, 
melodic, romantic arrangements 
for which the composer is known, 
and Moussorgskys The Flea, 
which was made familiar to many 
by Nelson Eddy, are two of the 
numbers which will be rendered 
by the Mens Glee club, directed 
by Mr. William A. Shaefer.
The two groups will combine 
in singing the traditional Tech 
songs.
Tickets at 75c each will be on 
sale shortly and may be purchased 
from any member of the Mens or 
Womens Glee club or at the door

will begin at 8:00 p. m. Friday evening, while Swing, with Bill 
LeRoys orchestra, is scheduled from 9 p. m. to 12 p. m. Saturday. 
According to co-chairman Bill*
Pounds, Beta Theta Pi, and 
Joanne Barr, Delta Gamma, CITs 
annual Sing and Swing will be 
highlighted this year by a new set 
of rules drawn up for the event.
Time Limit
For 7 V2 minutes each group 
will sing at least three songs 
one fraternity song, one song 
chosen from a pre-selected list 
prepared by instructors from the 
music department, and the re
maining songs of the groups own 
choosing.
No less than sixteen fraternity 
men or twelve sorority women are 
permitted to compete from each 
organization. There is no mens
maximum, but the women are not 
allowed to enter more than twen
ty singers. To sing, a member 
must be an active, pledge, or grad
uate student member of the group.
The three judges wiH each be 
required to score a critical sheet 
as each group performs. These 
critical analyses will later be re
turned to the respective groups 
so that they will be made aware 
of their shortcomings.
Quality Judged
Interpretation and general ef
fect, intonation, accuracy, tone 
quality, diction, and blending will 
be judged. Appearance, costumes, 
etc., are optional; they will not be 
judged, except under the interIden Payne DirectsiBichard IIP 
Next Drama Dept. Production
The drama departments next production, which begins March 
16 and runs through March 29, will be the annual Shakespearean 
play.
This years presentation will be Richard III, a historical play
~?dealing with the final conclusion 
of the Wars of the Roses between 
the rival houses of York and Lan
caster and the resulting peace 
through the establishment of the 
House of Tudor. Although Shake
speare isnt usually thought of as 
a writer of melodrama, this play 
contains many dramatic situa
tions, and may be termed a glori
fied melodrama.
Authority Directs 
As usual the play will be un
der the direction of B. Iden Payne, 
actor, producer, director, and au
thority on Shakespearean drama. 
Mr. Payne has directed Tech 
Shakespearean productions since 
1916.
In this production of Richard 
III, the costumes will be repre
sentative of the period of the play. 
In Shakespeare's play the cos
tumes were contemporary, be
cause the audience was supposed 
to feel the play was actually hap
pening.

pretation and general effect cate
gory.
Awards for first and second 
place will be made at intermission 
Saturday evening by Jack Col
lins and Dee Klester.
Admittance will be by invita
tion to both affairs. A new seat
ing plan has been organized for 
Sing. Reserve blocks of seats will 
be set aside for guests of each 
sorority and fraternity.
Objectives Stated
As stated in the new set of 
rules, the objective of Greek Sing 
is to create an affair that will 
stimulate competitive spirit on an 
amateur levelto create an affair 
that acts as a binder to hold Sing 
teams together throughout the 
year, and, thereby, develop more 
spirit in the sororities and the 
fraternities.
MMCC Tuition 
Takes Increase; 
Begins In Fall
$500 A Year Tuition 
Matches Other Scltools
A $20 tuition increase for 
MMCC has been approved by the 
executive committee of the Board 
of Trustees.
The new tuition rate, which will 
become effective with the fall se
mester of 1950-51, will bring the 
Margaret Morrison rates more in 
line with those of the College of 
Fine. Arts and the College of En
gineering and Science, as well as 
with those of comparable institu
tions in various parts of the coun
try.
Under the new scale, the tuition 
for a year at Margaret Morrison 
will be $500 instead of the pres
ent $480.
Other changes in the tuition fig
ures for Margaret Morrison in
clude an increase from $240 to 
$250 annual tuition for undergrad
uate schedule of 22 to 24 units, an 
increase from $200 to $210 for un
dergraduate schedule of 21 units 
or less, and an increase from $4.80 
to $5.00 per units for a graduate 
program of 24 units or less.
For 36 units or less of graduate 
study in social work the tuition is 
unchanged at $5.00 per unit, and 
evening class tuition is unchanged 
at $4.80 per unit.
This increase has become nec
essary because income has not 
kept pace with costs, and operat
ing deficits must be reduced, Dr. 
Douglass F. Miner, director of the 
Division of Student Personnel 
and Welfare, explained today.

Editorials
Pi *a<nuatic View
The Place of Religion in Higher Education 
has been chosen as the theme of Religious Dis
cussion week this year. The weakening structure 
of religion in American colleges makes this choice 
an excellent one.
The decline of religions importance among 
college students is paradoxical. Just at the time 
when religion can be most beneficial, the stu
dent is led by his education to neglect it.
The average college student grows to his or 
her mental maturity during the years he or she 
spends in institutions of higher learning, and t 
is at this time that some sort of philosophy of 
life evolves in most persons minds.
This philosophy seldom grows without the 
person experiencing periods of doubt, confusion, 
or indecision. A prayer to God can be most com
forting at these times. It can be most revealing, 
too. because a person has the opportunity to see 
himself and his problems in a different light as 
he relates them to God. The confidence gained 
from a talk with God is a great aid to a doubt
ful mind when a decision must be made.
Many students will scoff at these ideas be
cause they have been educated in college to 
accept only what they can prove or know to 
exist through the use of their five senses. The 
existence of God or the validity of our previ
ous statements can not be proven or tested by 
any physical experiment or measured by any 
meter.
We do not know what He looks like or if He 
takes any physical form at all. But we do not 
know what an electron looks like either, and yet 
we put it to work every day because we know 
how it can aid us. If everyone would test the 
usefulness of God as they test the electron, we 
would have few non-believers in the world.
Taking a very pragmatic view, we can not 
see the rationality in giving up God at a time 
when He can be our greatest aid and guide, 
just because His existence can not be proven by 
aneouation.
Two Tru isms
The parking situation on campus demonstrates 
two truismsthere rre bad citizens on campus 
just as there are in the community and country 
as a whole, and that many of the problems which 
make life on the campus uncomfortable can be 
solved if they are brought into the open for at
tack.
Our bad citizens charge is aimed at those 
who knowingly parked in places which block
ed entrances and exists of the parking lot and 
made the Student Council action necessary; and 
at the students who will not heed warnings and 
are continuing to do so just to test the law. 
The person who has collected five tickets in 
not many more days will find out that he must 
pay his fines before graduatingthe action 
taken by Student Council is legal.
The fining action was taken as a temporary 
remedy to a painful situation. The cause of the 
problem is the lack of parking space snd this 
situation is also being corrected. (See story 
page 1.) In both cases, action wTas taken only 
after students brought the problem to the at
tention of some responsible campus organization. 
If more students would do the same the campus 
would become a much more enjoyable place to 
live.

ParkinoViolators Seen 
As Minority Nuisance
An open letter to all students:
The purpose of this letter is to clarify any 
misinterpretation of Student Councils action in 
recommending the two notice system of handling 
parking violations.
The problem of handling parking violations 
was brought to the attention of Council by nu
merous students who felt that some action should 
be taken to prevent discourteous drivers from 
blocking the driving lanes in the parking lots. 
Student Council did not recommend the new 
regulation with the thought of creating added 
expense or imposing unfair regulations upon the 
students. It was felt at the time of approving 
the regulations, that the majority of the students 
would benefit by such action in that the regu
lations would help to eliminate parking problems 
created by a minority of the students who parked 
in such a manner as to block the passage of stu
dents who parked properly.
The following parking lots are governed by 
the new regulations: behind Skibo, beside the
FPHA barracks, behind Industries Hall, between 
Engineering and Machinery Halls, and between 
the TX and DU houses on Forbes street. The 
latter of which has a capacity for at least forty 
cars and has seldom been used to more than half 
this capacity during school hours. The parking 
spaces on Margaret Morrison street between the 
gate and Fine Arts, and on the street between 
Skibo and Industries Hall are also covered by the 
new regulations. Any areas reserved for faculty 
parking are duly marked.
Numerous violations have occurred in the lot 
behind Skibo where students have blocked the 
lanes on the gymnasium side of the lot. These 
lanes have been provided to enable drivers who 
cannot find a parking space to continue around 
the parking area without backing out of the lot 
which during rush hours would cause a conges
tion at the entrance to the lot and block traffic on 
Frew street. Frew street, and Margaret Morrison 
from the gymnasium to Forbes street, are not 
under the jurisdiction of the administration but 
are patroled by city police.
The administration has realized that existing 
parking areas will be greatly reduced with the 
construction of the new Industrial Administra
tion building on the lot behind Skibo. A com
mittee with representatives from the administra
tion, faculty, and student body have been investi
gating possible parking areas which they hope 
will accommodate more cars than the present lot 
behind Skibo. They hope that such areas will be 
available before the lot behind Skibo is closed.
Student Council has by its action tried to 
benefit the majority of the students and any sug
gestions concerning the new regulations will be 
appreciated

Inquiring Ite*por 1er
By Nancy Sitler
What do you think about 
mercy killing? This question has 
been discussed thoroughly in the 
nations newspapers, and the in
quiring reporter, not to be outdone 
by others, found out what Carne
gie Techs students felt about it. 
Don Bassett, freshman, says that 
I favor mercy 
killing as long 
as they make 
laws to keep it 
under control. 
There should 
be a check-up 
on both the 
doctor and the 
patient involve d. A law 
should be made 
that police be on hand when it 
takes place and the police should 
OK it beforehand.
James Helfrich, senior, 
was brief and 
positive: Im 
definitely 
against it. It is 
a definite and 
predetermined 
violation of the 
moral law of 
God.
Frances Rohrich, sophomore, believes:

Plaid Tankers Fourth 
In Penn-Ohio Meet
Carnegie Mermen Win Four Meets 
In Surprise Performance Of Year
Carnegie Techs surprise swimming team closed the 1950 season 
last Saturday by placing fourth in the Penn-Ohio Collegiate Asso
ciation swim meet, held in the Carnegie pool. The Tartan mermen, 
with 31 points, trailed third-place Case Tech by only two markers. 
Co-winners of the years fore-^-----------------------------------------------------
most swimming event in the dis
trict were Allegheny and Slippery 
Rock, each with 42 points. It 
marked the first time in the sixyear history of the meet that a 
team other than the Rockets or 
Westminster had copped top laur
els. The Titans finished a poor 
sixth this time.
Coach Claude Sofields inexper
ienced squad was figured to win 
only one or two of its dual meets 
this season and wasnt slated to be 
more than one of the also-rans 
in the Penn-Ohio.
Freshman Flash
Pre-season predictions failed to 
discourage the determined Skibos, 
however, as they copped four of 
their nine dual meets and were 
championship contenders in the 
Penn-Ohio from start to finish.
As has been the case all season, 
Dick Kramer and Nick Demas 
again led the Plaid in Saturdays 
seven-team competition. Kramer, 
the Freshman Flash, placed 
second in the 440-yard free style, 
third in the 220-yard free style, 
and anchored the second place 
400-yard relay team.
Demas copped two thirds, in the 
50-yard and 100-yard free style 
events, and swam the third leg of
the 400-yard relay. Gene Sapper 
and Tom Astle set the early pace 
for the Tartans successful relay 
team.
The Plaid swimmers were par
ticularly impressive in the 440- 
yard free style event. In addition 
to Kramers second place showing, 
A1 Macy finished third and Neil 
Houston fifth, thus giving the Ski
bos three of the five places.
The remainder of the Carnegie 
points were garnered through 
fifth place finishes by Bob Weddell, 
in the 150-yard backstroke, Roger 
Evans, in the low-board diving, 
and the 300-yard relay team.
Season Success
A recount of the 1950 season 
shows impressive Tartanwins 
over Case Tech, Westminster, 
Washington and Jefferson, and 
Grove City in dual meets. The 
Plaid mermen fell before Slippery 
Rock, Kent, Fenn, Oberlin, and 
Allegheny.
Last Wednesdays loss to Alle
gheny by a 39-35 margin was a 
heartbreaker, as the Skibos led 
until the final event, the 400-yard 
relay, which was won by the vis
itors. The Plaid bested the same 
Allegheny relay team in the PennOhio.
Emanon. Betas And Architects 
Lead IM Basketball Leagues
The Architects remained unde
feated in the American League 
last week as they won one game 
by forfeit. The Sigma Nu No. 1 
five and TX A team each won 
two games to stay close behind 
the Architects.
The Sigma Nus defeated PiKA 
36-25 and nosed out the Delts 41- 
39. Behind 24-16 at the half, the 
Delts outscored the Sigma Nus by 
six points in the third period, but 
failed to overcome the two point 
deficit in the final quarter.
Dukes Fall 
Action in the Federal League 
saw the undefeated Dorm Dukes 
fall before Emanon 41-35, thereby 
relinquishing first place to them. 
Emanon also claimed a victory 
over ASCE, 41-38, and another 
over the Phi Kaps, 41-40.
Emanon took the lead early in 
the game against the Phi Kaps, 
leading 29-12 at the half and 39- 
27 at the end of the third quarter. 
In the final period, led by the 
high scoring of Hans Ackermann,
Phi Kappa rallied, scoring 13 
points while holding Emanon to 
2 points, but time ran out as the 
needed point failed to be scored 
and Emanon remained undefeated.
Betas Still Lead
In the National League the 
Betas remained undefeated as 
they downed the unbeaten Kappa 
Sig five, 40-35. Taking the lead 
early in the first period, the Betas 
outscored the Kappa Sigs in the 
first three periods. In the last 
quarter Frank Motter of the Kappa 
Sigs scored five field goals and one 
free throw for a total of 11 points, 
but failed to overcome the fight
ing Betas.
High point honors for the week 
went to Dick Goss of the Obelisks 
as they downed the Chemists 72- 
34. Goss scored 11 field goals and 
one free throw for a total of 23 
points. Jack Wallace of the Chem
ists followed close with 21 points 
as the Chemists downed the Delts, 
58-37.

Plaid Wins Thirteenth 
From Grovers, 48-47
Throwing superstition to the wind Mel Cratsleys unpredictable 
Plaid quintet eked out a 48-47 victory over Grove City to notch 
their thirteenth triumph of the season. It was the second Tartan 
victory of the campaign against the Grovers.
Mr. scoring percentage Len 
Bianchi took eight shots from the 
floor, sunk six and paced the Tar
tan attack with 16 points. Bianchi, 
probably the least publicized 
starter on the team, has been a 
bulwark of the locals best post
war team and has what is proba
bly one of the best scoring per
centages in the nation.
The Plaid, taking three periods 
to get started, ran up twenty-two 
points in the last period to clinch 
the narrow victory. The victors 
trailed by three points at the half 
and seven entering the final 
period before they turned on their 
scoring spurt. Grove City rallied 
again in the dying seconds of play 
but fell one point off the pace at 
the final buzzer.
The victory gave the Tech Bas
ketball team its best season since 
1938. In that year the -Tartans
emassed an 11-8 record. This 
year Mel Cratsleys Tartans have 
won 13 games and lost 8.
Emanon won the first game by 
54 pins as Ray Carey paced hig 
team with three consecutive 
strikes in the last frame. High 
men were Carey and Charles 
Cooke of Emanon with 189 and 176 
respectively. Sigma Nu cut down 
Emanons lead to 24 points in the 
second game, and finally forged 
ahead with a 9 point lead after 
the third game.
Sigs Take Lead 
Both teams were at their best 
in the fourth game. Sigma Nu 
with 868 won by 67 pins over 
Emanons 801. Ed Schwendner and 
Ray Boyle of Sigma Nu were high 
with 226 and 199. Schwendner 
picked up two strikes early and 
then finished strong with 4 con
secutive strikes in the ninth and 
tenth frames.
Sigma Nu took the fifth game 
850-715. Both teams appeared 
tired and neither could match its 
previous performance. Schwend
ner was high man again with 200, 
followed by Boyle with 177.
Schwendner High 
Team averages were 163 per 
man for Sigma Nu and 155 for 
Emanon. Schwendner scored the 
highest individual average with 
190, and also tallied the highest 
game of 226. Cooke of Emanon 
and Boyle and Noelker of Sigma 
Nu followed Schwendner with 161 
averages.
Members of the winning team 
were Ray Boyle, Harold Noelker, 
Paul Radar, Ed Schwendner and 
Ernie Snoyer. Bowling for Eman
on were Ray Carey, Charles Cooke, 
A1 DeMaria, Fred Price and 
Frank Witt.

Carnegie Record 
Of 13 Victories 
Best Since 1938
With a flash of their amazing 
early season form, Carnegies bas
ketball Tartans wound up their 
most successful campaign in over 
decade last Saturday night. 
Labeled the surprise team of 
the district early in the season the 
Plaid basketeers were just that as 
they downed 13 opponents while 
losing 9 for their first winning 
season since 1938.
Record Output 
After lifting the lid with a rec
ord output of 79 points against 
outclassed Steubenville, the Tar
tan five almost duplicated the ^eat 
with a 78 total as they brought 
down the curtain at Westminster.
In the interim, Coach Mel Cratsleys hardwood stars bumped off 
potent Lawrence Tech, high scor
ing Bethany college, the always 
dangerous Geneva Covenanters, 
and a number of the smaller dis61

A WINNER
Returning to coach his alma 
mater, Mel Cratsley produced the 
first winning basketball combina
tion since he wore the Plaid him
self. The Tartan five finished with 
a 13 and 9 mark.
Tartans Lose Finale 
To Westminster, 91-78
trict quintets.
There is no question, though, 
that their most outstanding ac
complishment of the year was the 
double conquest of Pitt and Penn 
State during the now famed week 
of January 9th.
Basketball passed from the local scene almost unnoticed 
last Saturday night, but the Tartan five gave one of its most 
brilliant performances of the year.
With the close of the home portion of the campaign, a not 
entirely unexpected loss of interest on the part of the student 
body took place. The Tartans hadnt measured up to early 
season form in their late encounters and werent hugging the 
headlines as they did in early January.
At New Wilmington, however, Grocer C. Washbaugh and 
his proteges were wondering just why they werent. This was 
certainly a tougher Plaid five than they had faced in December. 
A team that now rolled up a fifteen point advantage and then 
staved off the Titans rally until the final seconds of the first 
hall
They werent too joyful during the ceremonies at the in
tersections, either. It took a tremendous surge of aggressive
ness on the part of the home team to keep their 68-game win 
streak intact. They were forced to return and beat the, Scots 
at their own game.
It is quite significant that many of the Westminster big 
men were still in the lineup at the final gun. The hard driv
ing -Jackie Jones fouled out with 37 seconds remaining.
Carnegie outscored the taller Titans by one field goal, but 
the winners won the ball game at the foul circle. It is notable, 
though, that three of the foul shots which the Plaid missed were 
turned into field goals by way of tip-ins. The Tartans missed 
fourteen of them and dropped a thirteen point decision.
At any rate, it is apparent that with feAV exceptions, par
ticularly the W & J engagements, the calibre of the Tartans 
play increased with that of the opposition. Like most first 
rate teams they performed best when under pressure.
And now all will be quiet on the varsity front for quite 
a spell. Other than the AMA track meets the arrival of the 
tennis, golf, and regular track seasons are the only centers of 
attention.

foul shots, and held a one point 
advantage by intermission.
Too Much Charity 
In the third stanza the home 
team scored on 12 of 13 charity 
tosses, while the Tartans had to 
be content with 4 of 11. Still with
in striking range, Coach Mel 
Cratsleys charges saw their hopes 
fade as Mike Theodore was chased 
on fouls with more than 11 min
utes left.
Carnegie outscored their highly 
rated opponents from the floor 
with a record-tieing output of 33 
field goals to the victorssum of 
32. A phenomenal mark of 27 
successful conversions of 33 free 
throws provided the margin of 
victory for the Titans.
12 In 26 
The Scots own output of 12 
points by way of 26 foul shots 
brought them within a single point 
of equaling their highest point 
mark, of 79 registered against 
Steubenville.
Carnegie, behind the ever ac
curate Len Bianchi, tallied on 40% 
of their 83 shots at the basket 
while the high scoring Blue and 
White quintet notched 35%. Three 
Titans topped the 20 point total 
as Jack Riehl led the Plaid with 
13 points.
Rifle Squad 
Places Fifth 
In Army Area
Out to make a place for them
selves, the CIT ROTC rifle squad 
fired themselves into fifth place 
in the Second Army Area com
petition. Last year after winning 
only eighth place in . the Area 
match, the same group went on to 
take fourth position in the Na
tional Army competition. If the 
improvement is any indication, 
these boys should finish in the 
money this time.
Scabbard and Blades annual 
intramural rifle match will offi
cially begin March 7, and run for 
three weeks. Teams entered from 
Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Theta Pi, 
Peta Sigma Rho, Citcom, Delta 
Tau Delta, Newman Club, and 
Theta Xi, will be out to wrest the 
high scoring crown from the Alpha 
Tau Omega No. 2 team which won 
last years competition with a 
record 957/1200 score.
The matches are to be fired in 
direct elimination, with the top 
three from each match advancing 
to the semi-finals. In case of a 
tie the total scores in the standing 
position will be used to determine 
the winner. This is done because
Lions Purr
The highly regarded Nitany 
Lions ran into the Scotsmen when 
the locals were at their peak The 
stunning victory coming on the 
heels of the 20 point slaughter of 
the clawless Panthers of Pitts
burgh sent Carnegie stock to a 
near record high.
Tom Craig, subbing for Frank 
Merriwell, kept the show on the 
road with his last second field 
goal to beat rallying Geneva.
But with the invasion of Wash
ington and Jefferson and the sub
sequent defeat came the lapse in 
play which plagues most athletic 
teams over the long haul.
Patiently searching for a return 
to their previous form, the Tartans 
started to come to life again as 
they stopped Pitt, Indiana State, 
and Grove r lty in succession as 
the end neared.
Born Again
It was then that the Plaid five 
exploded with their old brilliance 
and challenged th temporarily 
bewildered Titans of Westminster 
in ringing down the final curtain 
last weekend.
Recent ratings in the Pittsburgh 
Press listed the Tartans seventh 
in the district, behind Duquesne, 
Westminster, Waynesburg, and the 
like.

ALWAYS SMILING
Dottie Stewart, secretary to Dean Dickinson, takes a moment to 
smile for Tartan photographer. She has a smile for every one else, 
too, and will eladly listen to their troubles.
She'll Pack Up Your Troubles
Deans Secretary Kept Busy
By Dolly Mitchell ?
The life of a secretary is not an easy one* but it is exciting: 
Dottie Stewart, secretary to Dean Dickinson, will heartily agree.
Dottie laughed, My job never gets dull; there is always some
thing to do. This something includes not only secretarial duties
but also hundreds of little-recog-^---------------------------------------------------Dottie remarked, They come innized tasks. Dottie is a one woman 
clearing house for information; 
she receives messages for students; 
she acts as the chief sympathizer 
and Miss Anthony for many 
despondent and troubled students. 
Eyes sparkling, Dottie said, I get 
a kick out of it all. People are just 
like characters out of a story book. 
Gee, I enjoy working with people. 
Likes People 
That is the clue to her popular
ity; she loves to work with peo
ple. Students in need of loans 
come into the Deans office em
barrassed and suddenly find it is 
easy to tell Dottie of their needs.
here for loans and wont tell us 
how much they need. Sometimes 
I have a hard time pulling out 
what they want.
Dottie, perched on the edge of 
her chair, smilingly recalled the 
days when the Deans office was 
crammed into IH152. It was 
fun; everybody did everything in 
there  Student Council counted 
ballots; organizations held meet
ings. We were certainly all cram
med in a small space. But room 
152 set us off in a hilarious mood. 
There seems to be a different at
mosphere here than what students 1 
expect to find in a Deans office.
Freshmen are surprised the first 
time they come here and discover 
its not a cold horror chamber, 
or something like It.
Extra Service 
One can readily guess that this 
pleasant atmosphere is a result of 
the courteous and happy personal
ity of the pert secretary. Seniors 
walk in each morning and say, 
Dottie, can I leave my books 
here? Dottie has decided, It is 
hard for them to carry all those 
books around all day. So the 
seniors have found a handy locker 
space. When Joe College wants to 
leave a message for Fred Engineer 
he calls Dottie. Dottie thinks, 
What we need is a board with 
message punches in it. No task 
seems too insignificant for Dottie 
to do. Never does she refuse any
one.

Everybody talks about PLEASURE, but

That cigarette is Philip Morris!
Remember: less irritation means more pleasure.
And Philip Morris is the ONE cigarette proved
