Vol. 34 No. 3CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA.TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1940
Pres. Robert E. Doherty 
Approves Debate Plan
Action Follows 
Councils Okay
Student Council approved unan
imously at its first -meeting the 
plan to invite the vice-presiden
tial candidates of the three lead
ing political parties to the Car
negie campus. The proposal, which 
was outlined in last weeks issue 
of the TARTAN; was then' com
municated, to President Doherty 
for his approval. Yesterday, on be
half of the executive board, Dr. 
Doherty announced that the plan 
had been approved by the board, 
with the proviso that all three 
candidates must accept the invi
tation. In the event that one, or 
more cannot accept, the plan must 
be cancelled.
Meanwhile, the Tartan is inter
viewing prominent leaders in 
Pittsburgh1 civic life in order to 
present their reactions to the pro
posed debate. The following quo
tations are the results of some 
of the interviews. .
Judge Sara SoffelExcellent!
I think tha't students in college 
who are of voting age should meet 
the candidates. When you have 
the representatives, it gives the 
student body an opportunity to 
hear the standard bearers of each 
party. It will be helpful in giving 
an understanding of these times. 
It ought to be as interesting to you 
as to people out of school. All 
students ought to know what is 
going on. I think it is good. I ap
prove of it.
Judge Vol.3 4NNolCARol  
Most interesting to have the can
didates appear at Carnegie Tech, 
and discuss the isSues of the cam
paign. It would be a fine thing 
interesting1, exciting and quite 
instructive.
E.G Io.lS.T UNSOFolAll of 
my life has been devoted to such 
discussions. Have long been in 
favor of this kind of personal de
bate. I am enthusiastic about it.
I should call it very fortunate if 
Carnegie Tech could bring it to 
a general .audience.. That, would be 
a really' magniftcent ' contribution ' 
perfectly practical. Great, spec
tacular, dramatic expression of the 
institutions of American democ
racy.
Festivities
Come and Guzzle 
Cookies and . . . Tea
USHLSYRl ,oLA.PB
Huzzah! we, the Coffee Hags, 
Very Ltd., shout, as we scan the 
social horizon for the week. Fall
ing are tea-leaves of convention, 
and.-on the bare-shrub of events - 
that remains, we see the winterbuds that are a prelude to a 
cooky-festival. In line with the  
TARTANs campaign, the girls 
from Alpha Chi Alpha have de
cided to be hostesses for the Fes
tival.
So that the freshmen women 
may start their college-life prop
erly. Alpha Chi Alpha has plan
ned the Festival for tomorrow at 
4:30 in the Carnegie Union. Mem
bers of the organization will ac
quaint the freshmen with their op
portunities for work and-advance
ment on the TARTAN, Scottie, 
Thistle, Dorm Bag-Piper and the 
Bard.
P. S. Jake, the Alpha Chi Al
pha mascot, just whispered to 
one of the HAGS that T-E-A will 
be served in a back-room, to 
Freshmen only. Bleak disillusion
ment reigns over the leaf-covered 
earth, but we shall carry on, with 
renewed vigor and a bitter taste 
in our mouths.
Elections
Two positions are open on the 
Intra-Mural Athletic Board: one 
to be filled from the Art School, 
the other from the College,,of En-. 
gineering. In an effort to produce 
an impartial board, it has been 
decided that these positions inust  
be filled by non-fraternity, non
dorm men. The candidates must be 
commuters. Two other offices are 
also open at this timeVicepresident of Engineering Senate 
and Assistant Secretary to Stu
dent Council.

Factory Weddings
Carter Paints his Nightmare, 
Bride in a Mechanized World
I3 ,G IG
Today, at 11:30, Dr. HornellHart will deliver to a Tech audi
ence the lecture he has dreamed 
up called Love and Man*iage in 
the Machine Age. It seems a pity 
that Dr. Hart didnt postpone  this 
lecture for a while, because at a 
later time he would have been 
able to present it as an illustrated 
one.
We use dreamed up not as a 
slang phrase, but as a hazarded 
guess as to how Dr. Hart arrived 
at the subject of his talk. Mr. Clar
ence Carter, of the P&D depart
ment has literally dreamed up the 
painting which he is now work
ing on, and which could probably 
be used as an illustrationa sym
bolic one,, at leastof Dr. Harts 
lecture. The painting is called 
Bride in a Mechanized World.
Mr. Carter, whose nose for news 
is almost as good as his eye for 
color, got not only the idea, but 
the general composition of his 
picture, from a dream he had ear
ly in the summer. In the dream, he 
was painting away in his studio 
when he suddenly looked up and 
saw the luckless young lady, about 
to embark on her married life, 
surrounded by machinery of the 
most frightening sort. We never 
dream things so clearly, we said, 
and he said, simply, Neither do
I. Thats why I wanted to paint 
this dream.
The picture, the first draft of 
which is completed, shows the 
back of a bridea bride in the 
true fashion of show and roto
gravure traditiondressed in 
filmy white veils and the usual
delicate things that brides wear. 
She is walking down an aisle, 
which at first glance seems to be 
the aisle between the pews of a 
church, but which is really the 
space between machine rollers. 
The altar  is made of machinery  
parts. Above it hangs a heavy 
hammer, with parts of machinery 
that suggest heads of monsters on 
either side. The general effect is 
that everything is pressing in on 
the poor little bride.
Although the picture is not yet 
painted, the drawing is very clear. 
You can almost hear the Bridal 
March from Lohengrin being 
played by a chorus of riveting 
machines. We have no idea of 
what Dr. Hart is going to say at 
his lecture today, but maybe hell 
tell about the mechanical court
ship of this girlher lover prob
ably proposed to her in the Worlds 
Fair parachute jump.
Both Mr. Carters painting and 
Dr. Harts lecture are comments 
on the effect of our mechanized 
civilization on love and marriage 
and brides and grooms. A member 
of our history departmentwe 
dont dare mention his name, but 
you can probably guesssubmits 
this contribution to the question 
of Love and Marriage in the Ma
chine Age. He had asked his class 
for a definition of the Industrial 
Revolution, and this is the answer 
he got on one paper:
The Industrial Revolution was 
a change in the methods of repro
duction. Formerly reproduction 
was by hand; after the Industrial 
Revolution, reproduction was by 
machine.
Coal Process 
Is Patented 
By Dr. Weiler
Joseph F. Weiler and Burnard
S. Beggs, research fellows in the 
Carnegie Tech Coal Research Lab
oratory were awarded a patent 
on September 21 for a process for 
the conversion of coal into oils.
Under this process powdered 
bituminous coal will be subjected 
to high temperatures and pres
sures in the presence of hydrogen 
, gas. The products of this hy
drogenation, as it is called, .are 
oils for use in dye, lacquer and 
varnish. This step is only the first, 
however; and it must be carried 
out with some metallic oxide 
like copper or chroniumas a 
catalyst in order to rid the organ
ic products of any sulphur which 
would ruin the next step.
The second step treats these 
sulphur-free compounds with hy
drogen at lower temperature and 
pressure than in the first reac
tion. With nickel as a catalyst, the 
compounds are^cheaply and' quickconstitution of coal, 
ly converted into varnish oils, and 
also certain non-volatile oils. In. 
this way, over 80 per cent of the 
coal may be converted into organ
ic liquid hydro-carbons.
The by-product oils from the 
final step, although useless as eco
nomic fuels because.of their vola
tile properties, may prove useful, 
as lubricants.
This process is far more efficient 
than any hitherto known, and 
may open up an entirely new field 
of opportunity to the. bituminous 
coal industry.
Dr. Weiler came to Carnegie 
Tech in 1930 when the Coal Re
search,-Laboratory ..was first or
ganized.
IRC Schedules 
Rousing Party
The International Relations 
Club will begin its sixth year of 
activity with a bang on Wednes
day, October 9, at 3:30, when the 
club will have a big get-acquaint
ed shindig on the third floor 
of Administration Hall across 
from the oid Union;-All-Tech-wo
men  especially Freshmen  are 
invited.
During the last six years the In
ternational Relations Club, has 
grown to mean a gneat deal to 
women on the Tech campus. This 
club feels itself responsible for de
velopment stimulating and inter
esting discussions of world events 
and its many problems. Seldom do 
definite conclusions and clarified 
opinions result from an after
noons discussion, but the meet
ings always end with a spirit of 
good fellowship.
Many hot and many heavy ar
guments result from the diversity 
of opinions expressed by the mem
bers of the club, but Mrs. Chap
man, the clubs faculty, leader, is 
always on hand to see that no 
broken heads result from an overstrenuous discussion. Often the 
group goes off on a tangent, which 
only makes for more interesting 
and more spontaneous conversa
tion.
NYA Workers
Last Saturday, September 29, 
marked the end of the first pay 
period for N. Y. A. work. Time 
cards for that period are due im
mediately. All N. Y. A. applicants, 
whether they have worked during 
the period or not, should turn in

Tradition Preserved 
By Delta Skull
I3 IYNN Mercier 
What?No Tea!
It seems that certain subversive 
elements on this campus are at
tempting .to undermine and de
stroy those noble traditions of 
Dear Old Tech, which were es
tablished in the dim days of an
tiquity and have been loyally 
handed down to us by our prede
cessors.
Shall we throw down the 
Torch or carry it on to greater and 
nobler heights?
Delta Skull answers this chal
lenge with their announcement of 
a Gigantic, Coilosal (page Mr. 
Selznick) Tea Ball to be held on 
Thursday, October third from 4 
to 6.
Fun and frolic for everybody 
but, WITH TRADITIONTEA

Hornell Hart Talks 
At First Assembly
Stsm<l-iit
Do Your Studies 
With a Proxy!
We have it on good authority 
that Marshall Goldberglate of 
football famehad a secretary to 
attend classes for him, Mr. Gold
berg being much too busy with
ii his extra-curricular . activities to 
go himself. This secretary would 
take notes and then report to Mr. 
Goldberg in his baronial suite, 
where he would absorb these facts 
and pass his courses with a mini
mum of effort.
We are of the collective mind 
that the idea should be carried 
over to our campus. If one of the 
boys from across the street can 
have a sit-in for his classes, why 
cant all of the boys on this side 
of the street have the same? It 
has many obvious advantages.
There need be no fear .of fall
ing asleep in class, or of being 
lateno need to laugh at the 
profs feeble jokes. It eliminates 
the necessity of buying text books 
that the. professor has written 
it also eliminates the necessity of 
studying them. All you have to do 
is pay your tuition and hire your 
sit-in, who goes to classes and 
passes your tests. Then after you 
graduate, you may, if you wish, 
hire him to work at the job you 
are assured of getting.
For centuries, philosophers have 
been looking for a method of 
painless education. Now we have 
it. The millcnium is at hand.

Effects of Machine 1 
Age on Romance 
Will Be Discussed
Hornell N.. Hart, professor of 
sociology at Duke University, will 
discuss Love and MaiTiage in the 
Machine Age, at the first gener
al assembly of the term, today 
at 11:30 in the Little Theater.
This will be Mr. Harts third 
appearance in Pittsburgh. He has 
spoken twice previously at the 
Pittsburgh Community Forum, 
and those who have heard him 
agree that he is unequaled in dis
cussing the problems of young 
people with young people them
selves. In view of this fact, there 
will be a lengthy period for gen
eral discussion and questions fol
lowing the lecture.
Mr. Hart is an eminent lectur
er on social and religious subjects. 
Before taking his present position 
at Duke, he taught social ethics at 
Hartford Theological Seminary 
for five years and social economy 
at Bryn Mawr College for three 
years.
Also a well known writer, Mr. 
Hart is the author of six books, 
the latest of which are News
papers and the News" and Skep
tics Quest. He also contributes 
to such magazines as American 
Journal of Sociology, Interna
tional Journal of Religious Educa
tion, and New Republic.
Because of the obvious appeal 
a discussion of their own prob
lems has for all young people, not 
only Student Council, but the Int/crhonorary  Council as well, is 
sponsoring this assembly.
The' committee in charge of gen
eral lissemblies for the 1940-41' 
term is composed, of Dr. Lawrence
II. Shultz, Dr. Robert D. Gregg, 
and Arielgh Heifer, Student Coun
cil representative. ^

We have read in the papers 
within the past week of the sus
pension of a Perry High School 
English teacher for organizing a 
group of religious conscientious 
objectors to war and the military 
draft. This incident and a num
ber of others throughout the coun
try suggest that when the lid is 
finally pried off the draft bill the 
stench is going to be quite vile. 
This case exemplifies the restric
tions on religious, speech, and as
sembly freedoms now enforced by 
vigilante groups, and soon to be 
enforced by law under the con
scription bill as the military warmachine gathers speed. Such 
events are sounding the keynote 
for a new order in education.
Peace Advocate
Mr. J. C. Spahr Hull, the teach
er who was suspended, has long 
been known in Pittsburgh educa
tional circles as a conscientious 
war objector and Christian; he has 
been active in peace movements 
in the district, and is always in 
demand as a speaker. He fought 
to defeat the Burke-Wadsworth 
outrage in true form.
The meeting which was the 
cause of his suspension was a 
gathering of some of the religious 
conscientious objectors of the sev
eral city peace organizations, 
among them members of the 
Quakers, The Youth Committee 
Against War, and The Fellowship 
of Reconcilliation, to discuss their 
common problems regarding con
scription. This group, it should be 
emphasized, comprised only the 
religious objectors to war from 
these other organizations; they 
met because they felt that they 
had more in common with one
another than thpy did y/ith their 
fellow1 members in several of the 
more secularistic peace groups, 
and because at times their beliefs 
were not quite consistent with the 
programs of those groups. There is 
nothing, even iri the democratic 
draft bill, to prevent this group 
from meeting or even to prevent 
its members from registering their 
objectionsto service with the 
armed forces.
Not Draft Dodgers
Of course the newspapers call 
his group a draft evasion school, 
or a draft dodger organization, 
neither of which it can be. These 
people are not evading, avoiding, 
or dodging the draft as can eas
ily be verified by reference to a 
good dictionary, but they are say
ing: My religious beliefs prevent 
me from participating in military 
activities. I am willing to suffer 
the consequences of such a stand, 
but under no circumstances will 
I compromise my beliefs by giving 
aid to the armed forces. There is 
no semblance of evasion in such 
a declarationtheyre just telling 
you face to face what they are 
going to do. These people honestly 
believe that they are doing what 
is right for their country by re
fusing to to a part, of the violence 
of warfare. Some believe in con
junction with religious conviction 
that the only way to help the 
cause of peace, social progress and 
democracy in the world is to re
fuse to fight or help the fighters. 
And I must say there seems to bo 
just, as much, logic .in their argu
ments as in those of the militar
ist. Things have come to a fine 
state wheh people in high places 
say that if you dont believe as 
they believe, you must be done 
away with.
Another Case 
Mr. Hulls is not-the only case. 
Another .is that of a Mr. Streeter 
Stuart, foreign language profes
sor at Southeastern State College 
in Oklahoma. He was dismissed 
from the College because he wrote 
a letter to his representative urg
ing the congressman to vote

Proselytizing by Professors 
Should Be Extra Curricular
The right to believe whatever you wish''to believe and the 
right to express that belief, even though you are a minority o one, 
is the privilege of every member of a democratic society. The 
right to make known your opinion by publishing it, by shouting it 
from a soap-box, or by wearing a campaign button, is the heart 
of democracy. To abolish these rights would be to abolish democ
racy.
But the right to believe does not carry the right to coerce 
others to believe us you do. It is part of the American doctrine 
of fair1 play not to cram your ideas down someone elses throat.
For example: we would consider it rather unfair if police
men wore campaign buttons while on duty. The tendency for 
people who wished to stay on the right side of the law to mold 
their beliefs to suit those of the policeman would be irresistible. 
When a judge dons his official robes, we expect him to take off 
his campaign button. In private life, these people have the priv
ilege of arguing their opinions until they arc blue in the face. Us
ing a position of authority to show those beneath you which line 
they are to toe is not arguing. It is bullying.
Here at Tech, particularly in the field of social studies, pro
fessors have sprouted campaign buttons in such profusion that 
students see spots before their eyes. Whether these buttons are 
for Willkie or Iiooseveli, their educational value is, to put it mild
ly, questionable. The student feels a certain hesitation in answer
ing when a professor, wearing a Willkie button, asks, What do 
you think of the New Deal? The-student cannot afford to be 
honest in his views when an English professor, waving a Roose
velt banner like a college kid at a football game, asks, him to write 
a theme on the political campaign.
One instructor made things clear by prefacing the classroom 
recitation with the announcement, We are going to be impartial 
in this course. We are going to discuss everything from the em
ployer's point of view.
A student who worries about his grades has no choice but to 
be a Willkie man in one professors classroom, and a Roosevelt
 man in anothers. He finds that agreeing politically is just about 
the best way to apple-polish the teacher.
No one denies the professor the right to his political beliefs. 
After all, professors are expected to think, too. But when an in
structor puts himself in a position to intimidate willy riilly the 
students in his classroom we feel that he is carrying his authority 
too far. The practice is doubly obnoxious when it centers itself, 
as it appears to have done at Tech, in the social sciences, where 
without independent thought and complete freedom of debate, 
the courses do more harm than good. Political debate in class is 
an excellent thing but rather pointless'when the issues have been 
decided in advance by the campaign button the professor is wear
ing.
'in other words: Professor, we dont care whom youre for. 
.Tust check your campaign button at the door.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1940THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
How Draft Affects Carnegie
Of particular interest to the men. 
students of Carnegie are certain 
provisions of the Selective Train
ing and Service Act of 1940, 
formerly the Burke-Wadsworth 
Bill, to which the Tartan calls par
ticular attention, namely:
1) All male students, between 
the ages of 21-36 must register 
on October 16, 1940. Arrange
ments for a registration office to 
be set up on campus have not as 
yet been completed. Students who 
are cadets in the advanced

O. T. C., are not required to regis
ter nor are they liable for train
ing or service. However, those 
men who receive R. O. T. C. com
missions will be subject to active 
duty for such time after gradua
tion as the Army or Navy may 
require. In addition, the War De
partment contemplates setting up 
officer training facilities in select 
army camps.
2) Foreign students (male 
aliens), must register, but only 
those who have declared their in
tentions to become citizens of the 
country are eligible for service.
3) A student, who is a mem
ber of the National Guard will 
be subject to call for active duty 
and training and will not be placr 
ed on th potential deferrment 
list.
4) Any student between the 
ages of 18-36 can volunteer for 
one year service. President Doher
ty, together with our Government 
officiais, feel very strongly that 
efforts should be made to avoid 
the development of indiscriminate 
patriotic volunteering. A student 
may take his voluntary year of 
training at such time as will least 
interfere with his schooling.
Any person who entered school 
at the beginning of the semester, 
and who while attending school is 
selected for training and service 
before the end of the year or be
fore July 1, 1941, can, upon re
quest, be deferred from service 
until the end of the school year 
but not later than July 1, 1941.

By Ruth Brodie
We know the night school is in session again, because when 
we came to the office the Plaid had already claimed its rightful 
share of typewriters, and wo were reduced to coining shamefaced
ly to the editor, and in meek but nagging tones, like Uriah Hoops, 
wheedling the use of the typewriter in his inner sanctum. It/s 
a nice machine, but inclined to wobble. II: it doesnt fall oft the 
desk and pin us inextricably under it before the column is fin
ished, we shall count ourselves exceedingly lucky. If it; does, our 
not-so-gentle readers cun count themselves exceedingly lucky.
We were, terribly shocked to open the evening paperone 
of our incurable habits, like smoking marajuanaand discover 
that our friend Spahr Hull, who had always seemed to us one 
of the gentlest people we knew, is really an enemy of the United 
States, a draft-dodger, and a deadly influence on Perry High 
School English classes. He has been suspended from his teach
ing post for presiding at a meeting of young people with, religi
ous objections to serving in the Army. We cant understand 
what there is in what Spahr did to cause such action from the 
school board, and were afraid a Quaker we read about wouldnt 
be able to understand it either. The same public school system 
that suspended Mr. Hull taught us that this Quaker  as all 
Quakerswas a firm believer in freedom of conscience and a firm 
opponent of any sort of force. Hes probably turning over in his 
grave so fast now that they call him Whirling William Penn. 
Eo.o aSCoN G G G
Weve been reading the Editors mail, and we found a letter 
from the United States Post Office about the third annual na
tional letter-writing week. The TARTAN is asked to spur its read
ers on to writing those long-deferred letters that theyve been 
putting off and putting off. Every time we write a long-de
ferred letter we discover that the person to whom we write has 
either forgotten who we are, or got married and changed her 
name, or (so help us, this is true) entered a monastery. In any 
case, we always get the letter back marked No such person. 
This gives an uncomfortable, dream-like quality to our past, as 
if all those people we' thought we knew werent all fictitious 
characters that we dreamed up, like the Mad Hatter, or Peter Ibbetson. Its a frightening experience, and if the United States 
Post Office intends to make us go through if regularly, every 
year, in the second week of October, we expect something in re
turn, like a franking privilege for the week, or a special stamp 
issue with our baby picture on .it.
Agricultural Note
The heat of the impending Presidential election is indicated 
by the crop of hardy quadrennials, the campaign buttons, which 
are blooming in profusion on tho campus. Its surprising, not the 
number that are being worn, but the people who wear them. Un
demonstrative characters who have been hiding their political 
identity for years suddenly proclaim it; to the world. Its a 
good thing there are only thirty-five more days to save tho Amer
ican way of life. Wed hate l.o see faculty members walking 
around with screaming sandwich boards.

A logical extension of such agi
tation would be army advisors 
for our schools to make sugges
tions as to how the .teaching can 
best be made to harmonize with 
the defense program And with the 
first batches of draftees returning 
to civilian life, the man with mili
tary training will take precedent 
over the one without, and our 
classrooms will probably be col
ored with experiences and . glory 
of army life. Textbooks and cours
es will be changed to conform to 
the new patriotism. History, par
ticularly, will be revised to glorify 
militarism and obedience, etc.; the 
comparatively scientific attitude 
will be abandoned. If hysteria is 
reached, it is.possible that we may
see again the disaster of 1918 in' 
which the Students Army Train
ing Corps turned the college from 
an educational institution into an 
army training post.
We should heed the warning of 
intolerances to come in the case
of Mr. Hull. Even if we do not 
agree with his beliefs, I think it 
is our duty to at least protect his 
lawful freedom of conscientious 
speech and action, and destroy any 
possibility of an unrighteous mili
tary influence in our schools.

against the draft bill. He was ex
ercising the right of petition as 
did thousands of others at that 
time, yet for this he was deprived 
of his job.
I fear that such events may be 
a preclude to the reorientation of 
the school systems to conform to 
the demands of a military-minded 
people. Already we have heard 
clamors for a change or intima
tions that there will be a change. 
The Pittsburgh Press a month ago 
called for the public schools to 
gird the land to face the darkest 
period in its history by strength
ening the morale of the citizen. 
And how did they propose to gird 
the morale of the people? By 
teaching a 8T3lSHYd patriotism 
based on the belief that the pres
ervation and continuance of the 
democratic way of life is worth 
sacrificeeven of life itself. A 
fancy way of saying that they in
tend to teach war as the way to 
protect democracy!
I tremble at the thought of dy
namic patriotism if it means be
ing blinded to the faults of de
mocracy as we know it, and a my 
country, right or wrong philoso
phy, and if it means the mobbing 
of religious minorities as the Je
hovahs Witnesses, and the dis
missal of workers whose opinions 
do not coincide with those of the
employer. It smacks of a Heil Hit
ler! burial in life that admits no 
defects, ignores them, and finally 
crumbles from within from a can
cerous evil. Mr. Dummick, asso
ciate superintendent in charge of 
elementary schools is quoted as 
threatening that to bring about 
this dynamic patriotism they 
must emotionalize and drama
tize or work at every possible op
portunity. What do they do in 
German elementary schools.
Some educators are proposing 
that the school system be coordin
ated with the national defense 
program.

isits an all student musical re
vue on the same order as the Uni

by the students themselves. The

Womens Guild Plans
Tag Day Next Tuesday
On Tuesday, October 8, the 
Womens Guild of Carnegie will 
sponsor its fiYst tag day of the 
year. Little elephants and donkeys 
to stick on lapels or pin on dresses 
will be sold.
The Guild asks for a silver con
tribution on its first tag day. The 
money collected will be put into 
the Guild's fund for scholarships.
ROTC Drops 
Fifty-two; Men
Fil'ly-two men from the fresh
man and sophomore classes were 
dropped from the basic R. O. T. C. 
course due to physical disability.
There is a possibility that more 
will be dropped from the course 
unless permission is received to 
drill some men in civilian clothes. 
Permission has already been 
ranted to drill as many men as 
there are uniforms, but this does 
not include all the students who 
are enrolled.
A request from the R. O. T. C. 
department here at Tech for more 
funds to train the extra students 
has been refused since Congress 
has already appropriated the 
amoiint to be spent in colleges. 
Any extra appropriation granted 
to Carnegie would therefore cur
tail the activities at some other 
college in the country.
Although there is an over-enrollment of about ten men in the 
advanced course, the rigid phys
ical exam is expected to eliminate 
this number.

NOTICE !
A call has been sent out by Max 
Hannum, basketball mentor of the 
Tartan cage squad, for all fresh
men interested in winninga place 
on the Frosh basketball ^quad to 
report to the basketball dressing 
room on Monday, October 14, 
1940. If no one is present at that 
place candidates are asked to wait 
in the main mens gym.
NOTICE !
Coach Guy Halferty issues a call 
to all men, freshman and upper
classmen to report for cross-coun
try practice. The meeting place has 
been set at the Carnegie gymna
sium, and the time4:30 any af
ternoon during the Week.
This year the Intramural Board 
will offer three new sports hi the 
program of events. Squash and 
handball experts will have an op
portunity to show their skill in 
individual and tea pi matches soon 
to be scheduled. There are few 
sports in which the competition is 
any keener or the pace any faster 
than these, and it is expected that 
they will rank .among the most 
hotly contested events on the new 
"bigger and better intramural 
program.
The third new arrival on this 
years program will be volleyball, 
. a team sport which should prove 
very popular. Thistle Hall will 
probably be used as a battle
ground for the contests.
Speaking of Thistle Hall, those 
who wish to whip their table ten
nis and badminton games into 
shape for the tournaments will 
find facilities available there on 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 
from 3:30 to 5:30.
These three new sports will car
ry credits toward the Intramural 
Activities Trophy now gracing the 
recesses of the PiKA house, which 
should make it even tougher for 
the Morewood Boys to retain pos
session of the prize.*  > W ' Hi
This Friday at six oclock marks 
the deadline for touch football en
tries. Any group may enter 
team in the competition. In other 
words, any six fellows who feel 
like playing football can get to
gether, call themselves anything 
under the sun, get their entry in 
by Friday, and theyre all set. 
However, the Intramural Board, 
requests that entries be made only 
with the full intention of playing 
out an entire schedule. Last season 
there were entirely too many 
teams entered, especially in bas
ketball and softball, who failed 
to show up for their games, caus
ing confusion and plenty of extra 
work for the schedule makers.
It is suggested that each group 
appoint a manager so that they 
may be contacted through him. 
Entry lists are to include the name 
of this manager, who may be one 
of the players on the team. The 
members of the team must be list
ed in alphabetical order, last name 
first, followed by first name and 
the middle initial.
Entry lists may be mailed to the 
Intramural Board or they may be 
given directly to Mr. Eyman, fac
ulty advisor to the Board. Play 
begins on the cut on. Monday, Octpbpr seventh, and, judging from 
the number of teams . who have 
been getting in advance practice, 
the Deits are in for a keen fight 
to retain their laurels.

Tartans Defeat Covies 
21-0 After Poor Start
Muha and Jordano 
Star; Sophs Look 
Promising to Baker
A Carnegie Tech team that 
could not get started until the fin
al few minutes of the first half 
finally got rolling and provided an 
interesting third quarter for the 
visiting Geneva College team. The 
Tartans didnt look so good in 
their initial encounter due to the 
lack of a lot of scrimmage in prac
tice, according to Coach Baker.
There were very few casualties 
in the game for Tech, Ted Pruger 
being kicked in the leg and George 
Muha suffering a cleat cut over 
iiis eye requiring two stitches, 
iawrence Blihn, Geneva halfback, 
broke his shoulder, a recurrence 
of a high school injury and .will 
be out for several Weeks.
For the benefit of the Freshmen, 
Al,v who is the leader of the 
half-time-'cheer,- is A1 Mihetti, a 
Tech cheerleader who graduated 
in 1928. A1 is the originator of the 
Institute, and has been leading 
it every game since he graduated 
.as a favor to the students.
The first break of the game 
came when there was only a min
ute to play in the second quarter. 
The pass from Captain George 
Shimrak went over Frank Brunos 
head into the end zone where he 
was downed for a safety and tvvp 
points. On the first play after the 
kick from the twenty, Muha 
passed to Jordano for twenty-seven 
yards and a first down on the five 
yard line. On the third down Mu
ha again passed to Jordano for 
the touchdown. A march of 68 
yards in the third quarter ended 
when Muha Went over from the 
six yard line, the last of eleven 
running piays. In the fourth period 
Tech-drove 8 yards for the final 
score of the game. Included in this 
drive were a 31 yard pass from 
McLaughlin to Rader and four 
tries from the three-yard line be
fore Braun finally crossed the goal.
Genevas only threat came in the 
last of the third quarter through 
a series of passes. Starting \vjth an 
interception,' the Coveiianters un
covered a good pass combination 
in the persons of Perz and Jersey 
who worked the ball up to the 
eleven yard line where they lost 
it on downs. A 25-yard forwardlateral pass play was the feature 
of the drive.

Tartans Find New Unity Under 
Coach Eddie Bakers Tutelage
By Bob Cowle
There is conclusive evidence 
that Carnegie Tech will have a 
jfootball team that is worth talk
ing about. And how can we be so 
.sure of this? It is a logical question 
that you, the students, may ask. 
You might continue your inquiry 
by saying that there have been 
other Carnegie teams who looked 
equally good on the field, but 
did not seem to.be playing togeth
er. We need only point to Dr. Bak
er. While standing inthe locker 
room before the game I could not 
help but feel the prevailing ten
sion; the mutual respect be
tween coach and players, and 
among the -players themselves. 
The team dressed,  quietly helped 
each other with pads and tape, 
and exchanged determinations and 
promises.' Moving among them 
were Dr. Baker and his able assist
ants, helping here and explaining 
there; encouraging and criticizing. 
Extremely noticeable was the 
gentlemanly fashion With' which 
advice was given.
During half-time the squad re
turned to the locker room with a 
touchdown and safety under their 
collective belts, but in general the 
calibre of offense had-been slop
py and slow. Contrary to popu
lar conception, no blistering bar
rage of threats and oaths greeted 
the group. I dont mean to imply 
that the coaching staff lacked 
firmness,. but the tone of conver
sation breeded interest and re
spect. Within a few minutes Dr. 
Baker was at the board explain
ing, and quizzing the team. Glar
ing faults were pointed out and 
encouragement was offered. Soon 
the quarterbacks entered into the 
conversation, and gradually each 
fellow who had noticed something 
of strategic interest offered his 
information. Coach Baker quick
ly correlated the facts, and pre
sented the correct methods of at
tack and. defense. You all saw 
what 'happened at the beginning 
of the second half; the team scored 
a touchdown in six plays after 
the kickoff. You also noticed that 
every man on the bench got .a 
chance to play and to gain some 
valuable experience, many of the 
boys playing a major game for the 
first time. The bands of strength 
may weld slowly but the advance 
will be sure.
Bolsters Tech 
Soccer Squad
Last Monday Soccer Coach Pat 
OConner began putting his squad 
through their grueling workout. 
In spite of the fact that several 
of the boys are novices, OCon
ner hopes that he will win most 
of his games this season. Some 
of the veterans, are White, this 
years Captain; Wilson, wing; 
Walker and Thomas, who will 
probably alternate at goal; and 
Logan, fullback. Some of the 
Freshmen who, have showed up 
for the Frosh soccer team are Mc
Gee, Szoke and Benes.
Due to the fact that a fine bunch 
of fellows have turned out and 
that there are plenty of substi
tutestwenty-five on the first 
teamthe team shows good pros
pects for the coming season.
This years first contest is with 
Allegheny on October 11; Penn 
State, Slippery Rock, and F. & 
M. are among the other notable 
opponents in this years schedule.

En tertai n ment, 
Annual Election 
To Be Featured
On Saturday evening, October 
5, the annual Election Smoker of 
the Vocation Courses, Evening 
College of Engineeringmore 
generally known as Industries 
will be held in Old Carnegie Un
ion, Room 360, Administration 
Building.
A complete program of enter
tainment has been prepared by the 
officers in charge of this party. The 
show is scheduled to get under 
way at 8 oclock and to run 
through until 10:30. The vaude
ville will include music by a 
three-piece orchestra, acrobatic 
dancing by a comely feminine 
performer, and a comedy act that 
is really funny. Following a short 
intermission, semi-classical num
bers will be sung by a young 
lady. Harold Lenhart, who is in 
charge of the troupe, will act as 
master of ceremonies.
At 10:30 the principal business 
of the evening, election of officers 
for the ensuing year, will be giv
en the spotlight, and the present 
officers are urging all those eli
gible for office to come out. Fol
lowing nominations, votes will be 
accepted upon presentation of 
registration cards. While the 
votes are being recorded by a 
committee of impartial persons, 
the lunch will be served at the 
rear of the hall. Little time will be 
lost in counting votes and the re
sults will be announced promptly.
Many of the girls registered in 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege fail to realize that they are 
entitled to vote in the Industries 
election. While asking all Indus
tries students to attend this par
ty, the officers urge the Margaret 
Morrison girls in particular to 
come out. They will find this an 
agreeable way in which to start 
their years activities.
Following the custom of recent 
years, the first 100 Industries stu
dents arriving at the Union will 
receive a useful souvenir upon 
showing the registration card.
All workers for Insignias are re
quested to report at the Union 
at 3 oclock Saturday afternoon.
Enrollment
New Registration 
Shows Slight Cain
Obviously students at Carnegie 
Tech arent spending any time 
fretting over the impending draft 
brought about by the signing of 
the Conscription bill. Indicative 
of this fact is the increased en
rollment this year in the two col
leges from which the greater part 
of those eligible for Conscription 
will comeEngineering and Vo
cational.
Last years student enrollment 
in the College of Engineering to
taled 953, and this year has in
creased to 1062. In the Vocational 
school last year 1106 students 
registered and this year 1146 have 
enrolled. Registration in the Col
lege of Fine Arts this year totaled 
363 as compared with 462 last 
year, and in Margaret Morrison 
64 this year and 4 last year.
These figures are still not fin
al totals, but include registration 
only up to Wednesday of last 
week.
Dr. R. Simpson 
Offers Service
For the past year or two, Dr. 
Robert G. Simpson, of the Depart
ment of Psychology and Educa
tion, has performed . very noteworthy service in Remedial Read
ing for our day students. Ar
rangements have now been made 
to make this service available, on 
an experimental basis, for evening 
students. Dr. Simpson will have 
consultation periods in his office 
and laboratory, Industries 253-B, 
on Friday evenings, 6:30-8:30. 
Evening students who may wish 
to consult Dr. Simpson will be 
welcome. It is hoped that the eve
ning students will make use of 
this additional, service.
Many of you who will read this article are spending your 
first year here at Tech. During the comparatively short period 
of time which you have spent on the campus you have probably 
been introduced to many things which1 may seem new and con
fusing to youthe college elections are one of these things.
Perhaps you should be allowed a longer period of adjust
ment before being called upon to face any problem as serious as 
the elections. Unfortunately the set up of the evening student' 
government does not make such a policy possible. The new of
ficers must take office shortly after..school starts.
You should all endeavor to come out to the election parties; 
its just as much your duty to vote for a student official as it is 
to vote for a government man. All you need to be allowed to 
vote is your registration card which you will be asked to show 
at the door.
In an effort to make your evening as pleasant as possible 
each college offers a well rounded program of food and enter
tainment designed to be enjoyed by everyone. During the course 
of the evening, you are given the opportunity of meeting some 
of the men you will be associated with during the coming years, 
and also the men who will govern you.
In the past there have been those who have said that various 
cliques controlled campus politics. That may be so, but you, 
as voters, are the ones who are to blame if cliques control your 
college, because you have, in your power to vote, the weapon 
with which to destroy such groups. You cant put out a fire by 
simply shouting Fire, neither can you destroy cliques by stay
ing at home and shouting, Foul. So come out and vote; make 
the officers'who represent you, representatives 'of the entire-'col
lege: Take an interest in Tech and Tech will take an interest in
