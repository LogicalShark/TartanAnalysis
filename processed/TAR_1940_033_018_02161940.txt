Dr. Jones Son 
Is Recovering
Webster N. Jones, Jr., son of 
the Director of the College of En
gineering was brought to the Har
vard Infirmary at the beginning 
of this week. Doctors think that 
amputation of his toes will be 
unnecessary. They have placed 
his foot in a glass boot to pro
mote circulation.
Dr. Jones, who remained with 
his son for about ten days, re
turned to Pittsburgh yesterday. 
Although he suffered 'from ner
vous exhaustion last week when 
he arrived at his sons bedside, 
there is no danger of the previ
ously reported breakdown.
John T. Flynn 
Talks Monday 
At Local Forum
America Faces 1940 
Is Topic Chosen 
By Commentator
John T. Flynn, economic arid 
political commentator, will re
turn to the Pittsburgh Community 
Forum rostrum by popular re
quest, on Monday evening at 8:15 
in the Schenley High School au
ditorium. Mr. Flynn, whose books 
and articles on current affairs are 
read by millions of Americans, 
will analyze the domestic scene 
with authority, when he antici
pates: America Faces 1940!
Mr. Flynns book, Investment 
Trusts Gone Wrong, resulted in 
an investigation, by the Attorney 
General of New York, of the prac
tices of this type of business and 
accounted for the subsequent gen
eral attack upon these companies. 
Graft in Business described 
mariy enterprises and abuses later 
revealed by the Senate Banking 
Committee investigation of Wall 
street activities. So high was the 
opinion of Mr. Flynns knowledge 
of finances that he was called to 
act as adviser to the Senate Com
mittee investigating munitions.
In addition, his column Other 
Peoples Money appears each 
week in the New Republic, and he 
is the author of a syndicated daily 
newspaper feature.

Bate Is Chosen 
For Student 
Peace Strike
Friday, April 19, is the date 
set by the United Student Peace 
Committee for the annual student 
demonstration against war.
The first meeting of this sort 
was held April 6, 1934, at which 
time several thousand students 
participated in a strike against 
war, and showed' their opposition 
to measures which lead to war.
Each year, the demonstration is 
held in April as near to. the sixth 
of the month as possible, as it 
was on April 6, 1917, that the 
United States entered the first 
World War.
It is estimated that a million 
students will demonstrate this 
year that the Yanks Are NOT 
Coming to aid in the present war 
in Europe.
Gals Dont Appreciate 
Bees, Bugs, and Bats
We knew that some students 
were batty, but little did we think 
that bats were students. They 
must be especially fond of type
writing or what was the attrac

ing class the other day?
Heads bent and concentrating 
on their work, the class suddenly 
realized that there was an unwel

Thomas Addresses Sigma Xi, 
Tells of Cavitation Studies
Sigma Xi General Science Coloquium held its twelfth meeting 
yesterday and was addressed by 
Professor H. A. Thomas of the De
partment of Civil Engineering. His 
talk on Cavitation in Hydraulic 
Structures was illustrated by 
moving pictures.
The earliest study of cavitation 
at Carnegie was made in . 1935, 
Professor Thomas stated. The De
partment of Hydraulic Research 
had spent the two previous years 
in model studies of the Tygart 
Dam. By 1935 these studies were 
near completion and construction 
had begun on the dam. Then U. 
S. Engineers sent word that there 
had been trouble with cavitation 
on the Madden Dam in Panama. 
Tygart officials were seriously 
concerned, for their $18,000,000 
construction was much like the 
one in Panama, and they feared 
similar cavitation trouble.
For this reason the Carnegie
Hydraulic Research was autho
rized to make a further study of 
the Tygart Dam. To do this, it 
^vas necessary to build a new ap
paratus; Professor Thomas said 
he believed that this laboratory 
was the first in the world to con
duct cavitation research on sta
tionary structures.
As a result of this work, the 
Hydraulic Research laboratory 
contracted to make a similar study 
of the Madden Dam for Panama 
Canal officials, and since then 
has investigated cavitation on sev
eral other dams; at present it is 
working on the outlet tunnel of 
the Youghiogh'eny dam.
The American Society of Civil 
Engineers has honored Carnegies 
Department of Hydraulics by 
awarding the maximum space in 
their publication to a paper on 
Cavitation written by Professor 
Thomas and E. P. Schuleen.
terror soon made Bennie feel that 
lie was an intruder. Faster than 
Bennie could blink an eye, the 
girls took refuge in an adjoining 
room while Miss Winchester went 
to get help.
Back in a flash came the janitor, 
stick in hand; Mrs. Blackmore, bi
ology instructor, with her butter
fly net; and Miss Winchester wav
ing c. cjii* loth over her head, 
well protected by a hat. A few 
curious girls cautiously stuck, 
their heads in to watch the ex
citement.
Bennie didnt give in very eas
ily, but he was finally cornered 
through Mrs. Blackmores efforts. 
Strike one! Strike two! Strike 
three! And he was knocked out. 
The janitor had risked his life by 
standing on the top of a table and 
swinging his stick. Now hes a 
hero.
Bennie now lies in state in the 
M. M. Morgue, formerly known 
as Biology Lab. Friends and rela
tives are cordially invited to view 
his remains. Formaldehyde and 
other appropriate refreshments 
will be served.
This is the epitaph to be in
scribed on his tombstone:
Benjamin D. Bat'
BornYes.
DeadFeb. 12, 1940
Here lies Bennie, may be rest 
in peace,
Who bravely died o:i his bended 
knees.
He ventured alone into typing 
class
And now his remains are stuf
fed neath glass.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 1G, 1940
'Elders Cut Aid Allotmeist, 
Arrange War, Blniitl Army
Carnegies 245 NYA workers will probably be affected in 
some way by the .$15,000,000 cut in the NYA budget that is 
now being contemplated in Washington. This cut will mean 
that approximately 40,000 college students will be denied aid 
in the future. It will also apply to approximately 100,000 high 
school students and 25,000 non-students.
Another item of great interest to NYA students is the 
recent message of the United States Recruiting Service to the 
National Youth Administration state directors, instructing them 
to turn over to the Army lists of all males between the ages of 
18 and 25 who receive NYA aid. The following message, taken 
from an A.P. dispatch, was part of the order:
Perhaps many young men now receiving $14 to 
$21 a month from the NYA would find the armys base 
pay $21 a month for a recruit, plus food and clothing, 
more attractive.
It is also interesting to note that at present the national 
arms budget is the greatest in the peace-time history of the 
United States. On Tuesday a $966,722,678 Navy Supply Bill 
was placed before the House.
The charge made by some that it is to the interests of 
the Army and the government, to keep NYA wages and funds 
as low as possible in order to make army pay more attractive, 
is possibly not literally true, but that the effect of this eco
nomic pressure will be to drive needy youth into the Army, 
seems probable, as has been the case in the CCC where appli
cants are actively encouraged to enlist in the Army and Navy. 
A list of hints was recently sent to United States Army re
serve officers pointing out that the unemployed would be likely 
prospects for enlistment.
This week a 49-27 vote in the Senate favored a Bill pro
posing to advance up to $20,000,000 in new export credits to 
the Republic of Finland. The Bill now goes to the House 
where it will be given preferred status. When this Bill passes, 
it will be only one of many actions which, if continued, will soon 
place the United States in such a hostile position to certain 
warring nations that retreat from an open declaration of hos
tilities will be impossible.
So the youth of America looks on while its respected elders 
prepare for American participation in the war, cut appropria
tions for aiding youth, and benignly arrange to place those 
denied aid in the Armj'to fight the war.

Many Students Cooperate 
By Attending Meetings
By Anne Andra.so
Religious Emphasis Week on the 
campus officially began Monday 
afternoon with a seminar spon
sored by the Newman .Club and 
conducted by Father Paul .T. Rock. 
The general theme ot' the week, 
j Religion in Personal Living, was 
' discussed irom the standpoint of 
our purpose in life. Father Rock 
concluded that the happiness 
which we all seek comes only 
through knowing and serving God.
Dr. Robert F. Galbreath, presi
dent of Westminster College, was 
the speaker at the Chapel Service 
sponsored by the Mens and Wom
ens Christian Associations Tues
day morning. He challenged col
lege students to develop their 
spiritual life, and he expressed an 
optimistic belief that the younger 
generation could and would, help 
solve the problems of the world.
At the well-attended seminar 
conducted by Dr. Bex-nard Clausen 
later Tuesday afternoon it was 
brought out that people today 
waste a great part of their life. 
Dr. Clausen referred his audience 
to the Bible for a constructive 
plan of living.
Two Carnegie students, Mar
garet Townsend '41, and James 
Wills 40, appeared with Dr. 
Clausen on his radio program 
which was broadcast over WWSW 
Tuesday evening. Representatives 
from Pitt and PCW also partici
pated in this discussion of re
ligion on the campus and the stu
dents reaction to religion.
On Wednesday afternoon, the 
fraternities and women's dormi
tories helped promote the Relig
ious Emphasis program by invit
ing local ministers to be guest 
dinner speakers. Dr. Morledge 
spoke to commuting women at a 
dinner meeting held in the Car
negie Union. This meeting was 
sponsored by the various womens 
ox-ganizations to include all girls 
not living in the dormitories.
Dr. Louis Mann spoke at a very 
\Vell attended Chapel service yes
terday at 11:30 at the Theater of 
the College of Fine Arts. He also 
spoke to a smaller group at a 
seminar in the Union at 4:30. The 
general opinion was that Dr. 
Manns talks had been a fitting 
close to a very successful program.

The architects are the rudest 
and cx-udest and least presentable. At least thats what Dean 
Keeble said several yeax-s ago 
when an impromptu night football 
game between the ax-chitects and 
the dramats in the halls of the 
Arts School resulted in several 
pieces of smashed statuary.
Sometimes their fun x-eaches 
into high places. Last year, dux*- 
ing a banquet held in the Arts 
School at which President Doherty 
was px-esent the architects sent 
one of their membex-s clattering 
down the staix-s in a large wooden 
basket while two others, feet 
planted precax-iously in desk 
drawex-s, came skiing down be
hind.
Another Cute Trick
The boyshave another cute 
tx'ick. Its a stand-by, used when
ever life gets dull and the oppor
tunity for something more spec
tacular doesnt px-esent itself. It 
consists of dx-opping water-filled 
bags on the heads of the un
fortunates who pass beneath the 
windows of the drafting room. 
The law of averages has been 
with them. Once they made a 
dix-ect splashing hit on a mem
ber of the faculty. The language 
they heard on that occasion, the 
ax-chitects claim, is the reason for 
their loss of respect for the dig
nity of the professorial gown.
School traditions have not been 
spared. Some yeax*s ago the 
Spring Carnival included a 
sleeping beauty act pei-formed 
in front of the Ax-ts School. The 
curi*ent campus beauty was re
clining on a draped couch, waiting 
for the climactic kiss of Prince
Charming. He appx-oached and 
knelt, lips puckered. The audi
ence held its breath. When tho 
prince was within an inch of his 
goal, from evex-y side there 
came the screeching,, changing, 
arid clattering of alarm clocks. 
Sleeping Beauty awoke without 
the benefit of Cupid.
Sober heads decided that to 
avoid open warfare with the 
ax-chitects all Spx-ing Carnival ceremonies should henceforth be con
ducted in the open-air theater, 
far from the attention and 
temptation of the ax-chitects.
Slight to the Dragons
One evening yeax-s ago, a lax-ge, 
happy crowd gathered in the 
open-air theater for call-day ex
ercises. The climax was the call 
for Dx-agons. The audience was 
hushed with x-espect, as the speak

SLANTS
TEMPLE EDITOR TRIES TO REVIVE 
BASKETBALL LEAGUE
 By DOC BURKE, Sports Editor
We received a letter the other day* from George Sehuhnan, 
Sports Editor of the Temple University News, asking about the 
possibility of reviving the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball 
Conference. He states that there is a distinct sentiment at 
Temple in favor of reorganizing the now defunct league.
At the present time all the teams with maybe one excep
tion play each other on a home and home basis. Therefore, Mr. 
Scliulman thinks it foolish that the league not be continued.
If most of the schools are in favor of reviving the Confer
ence, this information will be presented to Earl R. Yeomans, 
Temple Graduate Manager of Athletics and former president of 
the league. If he sees that most of the former members are 
in favor of the proposition, there is a great chance of definite 
action.
However, the one factor we think lias been overlooked is 
that the reason the league was disbanded before was the diffi
cult}' in arranging the schedules. At least, that was the reason 
given at the time. Possibly, all those schools concerned' now 
feel differently on the subject. But, we think that more than 
a little difficulty would be experienced in interesting the former 
members in the dead conference. Particularly does this apply 
to Pitt who was not pleased with the previous set-up.
The reviving of the league would probably meet with favor 
with basketball followers.
*=###*
Techs 1940 Schedule Is Light
A casual glance at Carnegie Techs football schedule for 
next year reveals a movement towards a lighter card in hand 
with the lack of .material coming up from the Freshman squad.
Even though such old tough opponents as Hply Cross, 
Notre Dame, Pitt', and Duquesne will be met, Geneva, Cincin
nati, and Case can hardly be called major foes. Possibljr, this 
schedule reflects the -policy of the Athletic, Council in drafting 
a schedule to suit the material here at Tech.
Next year Dr. Baker will have an experienced but small 
squad, which should give a good account of itself. But the fu
ture is clouded in doubt. In fact, if some scholarship men are 
not brought in, it is very doubtful if such teams as W-J could 
be met with successful results. Probably the best way to loolc 
at the situation is with hope that everything will work out all 
right.
Jottings About This And That
Paul Friedlander, alias Speedo, is being called the 
crooning troubador these days. And small wonder, too! 
with his beautiful rendition of sentimental valentine greetings 
by phone . . . Kermit Patton, basketball forward, re-injured his 
linee in practice last week and will probably be confined to the 
sidelines for at least the next couple games. Kerm played only 
a few minutes in the Duquesne game, hoping to be ready for 
the fray with Temple . . . Dave Brinn, one of the better Fresh
man basketball players, will be out of action for the remainder 
of the year. Knees injured in the Penn State game are the 
cause.

Skibo leers Defeated 
By Strong Duke Team
Vance Scores Three Goals and Makes 
One Assist To Lead Dukes To Victory
After two disappointing games 
with John Carroll, the Duquesne 
Dukes again hit top form on 
Tuesday against' the Skibo skaters 
and snowed them under by a 4-1 
count.
The seige gun of the Bluffites 
offensive was bespectacled Bill 
Vance who performed the trick of 
scoring three goals and then 
threw in an assist on Jim Hansberys trick shot that slipped un
der Feilers pads to have a hand 
in every goal the Dukes regis
tered.
That the Dukes were out to 
net plenty of goals was evidenced 
by the fact that they started five 
linemen. With the exception of 
Schiiawskes back-hand shot on a 
pass from Sivachek half way 
through the final period, the Tar
tans were left out of the scor
ing. This was due to their failure 
to connect on the few good shots 
they had.
McMillin, the' Dukes goalie; was 
called upon to make only three 
saves in the first two periods. In
the. third period, however, when 
the Plaid line really began to 
move into Duke territory, he was 
very effective in blocking the 
shots of Burleigh, Schilawske, and 
Wilsonshots which ordinarily 
would have been sure goals for the 
Tartans. The failure of the Tar
tans to make a penalty shot award
ed them when Unger threw 
Swacheks stick at Burleigh, who 
was in the open, proved the Ski 
bos had an off day.
On the other hand, every one 
of Vances goals was the result 
of a pretty - passing attack that 
brought the puck right up to the 
net where Feller couldnt handle 
it.
The next time the Tartans take 
the ice is Monday, February 19th, 
when they meet Western Reserve 
in half of a double-header which 
also includs Case vs. Duquesne. 
The Plaid stickmen have a 1-0 ver
dict to their credit over the Red 
Cats already, and they will be fa
vorites to repeat.
Whitey Lee, "Wally Ingalls, Tiger Schmidt, Johnny Lloyd, 
and Chippy Miller have organized a basketball team and will 
accept all challenges. Chang Dunn, Paul Friedlander, and Tony 
Laposki have been trying to make the first team, but so far to 
no avail. The latter three players still have another year of 
football so they are not eligible to play outside games.
However, all these fellows have been working out' with 
the varsity lately and are looking pretty sharp. After being, 
defeated the other night by the first team, Speedo Friedlander 
spoke as such: We was robbed.
Tartan Plebes 
Lose to State 
Basketballers
Techs Freshman basketball 
squad suffered their third defeat 
of the season at the hands of the 
Penn State rookies last week. The 
Penn State club hit the hoop to 
the tune of thirty-one points while 
the Tartans netted twenty-one. 
Central Catholic also rang up a 
ten point victory against Techs 
Freshmen last Friday night. In 
spite of these two defeats, the 
Techmen are confident of victory 
when they meet the Duquesne 
plebes this Saturday.

Coach Maxie Hannums basket

they head eastward on Friday for 
two meets with Temple and 
Franklin and Marshall. The first 
will be part of a double header in 
Philadelphia, while the F & M 
contest will be played in Lancaster 
on Saturday night.
Max is glad because of the 
definite healing of Jimmy Tumpanes anlde and the shaping up 
of Ted Fisher. With Red Burch 
and Hennessy back in the fold, 
the squad is at its full strength. 
With Captain Rube Stark, Red 
Sturgeon, Johnny Burke, and 
Hank Holets all in shape, the 
squad will be ready <for anything.
Temple Has Good Squad 
Temples five, one of the top 
squads in the east, is a rangy team. 
N. Y. U., considered one of the top 
five teams in the basketball field 
in the country, took over the Owl 
quintet by only five points. Tem
ple has hung up a nice string of 
victories and presents a formidable 
front to the Skibo squad. Last 
year, in a home-and-home two 
game series, Tech came out the 
victor in both contests. Both 
teams were members of the East
ern Intercollegiate Basketball 
League, which is now defunct.

Fencers Give 
Demonstration 
In Tecli Gym
Foil Matches Held; 
Girls Do Mass Drill; 
Boys Fence Sabre
In spite of the fact that Du
quesne fencers failed to show up 
the Tech campus for their 
scheduled meet with the Skibo 
DArtagnans, the Tech boys and 
girls went right ahead with their 
demonstration and lengthened it 
out to take the place of the meet.
Captain Mario Monacchios stu
dents have progressed well on 
their way to fame. The first 
demonstration on the program 
was a drill of fencing tactics put 
on by the girls of the class dress
ed in white. The captain gave cer
tain positions and thrusts used in 
the sport and the girls followed 
them through in a precision drill.
Foil Match Featured 
The boys and five gii-ia put on 
some exhibition matciies In foil 
and then in sabre. The girls who 
fenced in the matches are June 
Kirkpatrick, Ruth Brodie, Helene 
Jaffin, Irene Von Horvath and Peg
gy Young. A feature of the meet 
was the foil match between Miss 
Young and Willard Scott.
Representing the boys in the 
meet were Captain Gary Law
rence, Ed Quill, Andre Szoke, Sam 
Lift, Harvey Fichter, Roland 
Kraus, Willard Scott and Art 
Hirsch. Each man fenced two ex
hibition foil matches, the second 
round being done all together.
To climax the meet, two 
sabre bouts were staged, be
tween Szoke and Fichter, and 
Captain Lawrence and Hirsch.
Later in the season, most prob
ably in March, an open meet will 
be held in foil and sabre fencing 
to which fencers from other col
leges will be invited to compete 
for the top honors. Captain Monacchio is giving his fencers fur
ther training now towards reach
ing the top in their own divisions 
j.n the sport.
Riflemen Win; 
Take Wheaton
Girls Win Victory 
Over Rhode Island
Wednesday afternoon the re
turns of the Rifle teams first 
Postal Match came in giving the 
Tartans two wins and one defeat. 
The boys team shot a score of 
1371 beating Wheaton whose score 
was 1318. Ohio States score of 
1387 was enough to win the match. 
The Carnegie girls made a fine 
showing by out-shooting Rhode 
Island State 495-486. The scores 
were' quite satisfactory for this 
stage of the season.
Techs sharp-shooters Greene, 
Whittum, Pemberty, and Min
ton were jpaced by McMillan 
with a score of 280. Miss Novak 
of the girls team led her. team 
with a score of 100. Miss Thomas 
also made a score of 100. Miss 
Reich, Miss Purse, and Miss Bern
stein shot w'ell. There is another 
match being completed, and Tech 
is shooting against teams such as 
Oregon State.
A postal match is similar to any 
regular match, only the competing 
teams shoot from their respective 
ranges. These shotfests have no 
bearing on the National ratings, 
but do give the coaches a fairly 
accurate measure of their teams 
ability.
Citcom Clan, 
Frosh Continue 
Victory Pace
Kappa Sigs Win 
Over Betas, 33-14; 
SAE's Top Phi Kaps
The Citcom Clan quintet rang 
up its fifth straight victory on 
Monday evening by beating Hen
derson Hall, 27-1G. Again it was 
the Clans big guns, RuthraulT and 
Loveday, who led the way to vic
tory with 8 points apiece. Swede 
Paterson of the losers, however, 
was high scorer for both teams 
with 9 counters.
Meanwhile the Freshman, En
gineers kept on the Clans tail by 
trouncing the AIChE squad by a 
44-15 count. Nickel, Pratt, and 
Hindall rang up 14, 12 and 10 
points respectively for the victors.
Scobell Hall notched their fourth 
win at the expense of the Delta 
Sigma Club aggregation with a 
38-18 triumph. Bob Bub, Scobell 
guard, tossed in six field goals and 
a foul shot to tally 13 points. Bev| an, of the Delta Sigs, was not far 
behind with 12 markers. Mondays 
fourth scheduled fray, the Inde
pendent Freshman - Architects 
game, was postponed.
On Tuesday the fraternity 
squads went into action with the 
Kappa Sigs taking on the Betas 
ancl the SAEs tackling the Phi 
Kaps. The Clyde Streeters had lit
tle trouble with the men from 
Squirrel Hill, and emerged on the 
long end of a 33-14 score. Joe 
Thomas notched 12 points for the 
winners while Gaub and Spang
ler, Kappa Sig guards, did a neat 
job of keeping the opposition 
away from the hoop.
The SAEs bounced bnck from 
their defeat at the hands of the 
PiKAs to down the Phi Kaps in 
a low scoring contest, 115-7. Herb 
May led the winners with six 
markers, while White accomplish
ed a rare feat in tallying one hun
dred per cent of the Phi Kaps sev
en points.
Tech Natators 
Take Jaunt 
To Cleveland
This week-end the Skibo mer
men set sail for Cleveland where 
they will take on the natators of 
Western Reserve Academy, and 
the Scientists of Case School of 
Applied Science. The first leg of 
this twin bill will be run oft on 
Friday afternoon, the Clansmens 
opponents being the tankers of 
Western Reserve. On the follow
ing day the Case swimmers play 
host to the splashers of Carnegie.
These two contests should prove 
to be real battles if past records 
are to stand for anything at all. 
During the twelve years Carnegie 
swimming teams have raced 
against these two schools, the Tar
tan mermen have won six from 
and lost six contests to each of 
these respective schools.
Up to date, this seasons record 
has been nothing to tell all the 
world about. However, Coach 
Risedorph is looking forward to 
brighter days, for several of his 
key swimmers are just beginning 
to turn in the racing times they 
are capable of attaining.

By Miriam Host
Did you ever hear of an artist 
\vao gave away his creations?
| Duncan Delatoro, 42. student in 
industrial Design, has given away 
practically everything he has 
made. He says that he can tell 
by looking into peoples eyes 
whether or not they really appre
ciate the work, and if they do, 
why shouldnt they have it?
When Duncan was seven years 
old he was making boxes, . dog 
houses and cat houses at his home 
in Santurce, near San Juan, Porto 
Rico. His father once told him 
that the best present he could get 
was a board and some nails. In 
1935, Duncan, with his father, set 
up a workshop and bought the 
tools necessary for the delicate fil
ing and polishing of bone and 
wood figures. For wood carving 
he prefers walnut because of its 
fine texture.
Here at Tech he is doing not 
only his class work on Industrial 
Design, but is continually experi
menting with new mediums. On 
a recent problem he was looking 
for a substitute for paper. Finally 
he thought of spraying celluloid 
with a mixture of gold paint and
fixative. Viewed from the under
side this tow material has depth 
and an unusual quality.
Aside from experimenting with 
mediums, Duncan is interested in 
many things. He wants to go 
back to Porto Rico and $en a 
furniture shop, making e.K creat
ing his own designs. /He has 
worked on an idea for .improving 
the body and motor design of au
tomobiles, and has written sev
eral boleros, in collaboration with 
a friend in the Department of 
Music.
Usually Duncan is finished with 
a six-hour problem in an hour 
and a half. This, he thinks, is 
due to his visualizing the fin
ished product before he begins ac
tual work.
What to Wear
Where?
FOR THE MEN . . .
Although college men are usual
ly decidedly informal in their 
dress, there arte many who prefer 
less casual styles. For the more 
conservative of our number, the 
blue,. pin-stripe, moderately drap
ed suit, pictured below is the 
ideal garb for ordinary dates, in
terviews, and ^Sundays.
It is certainly true that such a 
suit is comfortable and gives its 
wearer the right touch of matur
ity which so many of our styles 
lack. It also has the advantage 
of being right for fairly dressedup occasions in any season and 
in any year.
The double-breasted style has 
the advantage of fitting properly 
without looking as though it had 
been hung on the wearer willynilly, in the general fashion of a 
sack, as do so many of the singlebreasted models foisted upon the 
unsuspecting public.
Mens clothes are trending more 
and more toward the conserva
tive, depending upon fit and rich
ness of fabric, rather than upon 
flashy colors and loud designs. 
Sports and casual coats may still 
resemble Josephs coat of many 
colors, but suits and topcoats are 
softer, solid shades which are 
more practical, especially for the 
man who cannot afford to possess 
three or four of each. The loud

With all the fuss about military 
activities, its only natural that 
the spirit should appear in our 
fashions, but for all our apprecia
tion of trim lines and the military 
snap, we gals still, want our clothes 
to be flatteringly feminine.

Today... 
In the Tartan
February 18, 1915: War had 
been declared in Europe and the 
nations were busily engaged in 
the slaughter. The effect of the 
.42 centimeter German guns were 
described by an Irishman as fol
lows: Furst there wuz a divil of 
a big noise-rran thin the nurse sez, 
Will ye have another drink of

The Allegheny five swooped 
down from Meadeville to whip the

then coached by the Wagner 
brothers, A1 and I-Ionus.
George S. Swain of Harvard 
spoke to the science classes. He 
told of the amazing scientific pro
gress he had seen during his 
travels in Germany. Mr. Swain 
debunked the idea that a college 
education is necessary for suc
cess in engineering. What is 
this college bread we hear so 
much about? Nothing but a four 
year loaf! Reading of the classics 
and the development of executive 
ability are all that is required for 
a successful engineering career. 
Peace Meeting Held 
Substantial improvement of the 
steel trade due to the European 
War was reported. That evening 
an anti-military meeting was to 
be held in the Carnegie Institute 
Lecture Hall. Dr J. Leonard 
Levy, well-known peace advocate, 
was to be the guest speaker. Since 
Pitt men would probably turn out 
in large numbers for the meeting, 
all Tech students were urged to 
attend. Carnegie could not be out
done in anything even when it 
came to listening to dull lectures 
about a topic which would never 
concern them.
Suffrage Attacked 
Mrs. Goodwin had been a suf
fragette. Now, however, she was 
convinced that the power of the 
ballot could not be used sensibly 
by women. She had addressed 
students and faculty of Margaret 
Morrison to this effect on the pre
vious Wednesday. Mrs. Goodwin 
was now on her way to join the 
Anti-Suffragette party and lend 
her aid in preventing woman 
suffrage from becoming legal.
Tuition for all regular day 
courses was $58 a year. For night 
courses it was $18 a year.

The authorities of the Uni
