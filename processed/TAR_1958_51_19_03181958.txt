Blood Drive 
Begins Today
Today the Veterans Club of 
Tech begins its campaign for the 
annual Blood Donation Drive in 
conjunction with, the Veterans 
Hospital of Pittsburgh, the Red 
Cross, and the Central Blood Bank.
Through the individual depart
ments, fraternities, sororities, and 
various other campus organiza
tions the club will pass out the 
necessary forms: 
(1 A blood donation pledge 
Card.
A parental permission 
slip for donors under 21, 
to be signed and return
ed with the pledge card 
so that the ied Cross 
will know how many 
contributors to prepare 
for.
A letter to the students 
parents explaining the 
purpose of this blood 
drive and how the 
Family Plan works.
Cards are also available in the 
Veterans Office on the second 
floor of Administration Hall or in 
the Registrars Office.
Family Plan 
This Family Plan is being arcanged through the Red Cross and 
the Central Blotid Bank. Each 
donor will receive a card entitling 
him or any member of his imme
diate family to a free pint of blood 
whenever needed during the year 
after his donation. This plan 
should be particularly important

Student Congress 
Hears State Of 
Campus Address
Last Wednesday Merle Steir, 
president of the Executive Coun
cil, presented the State of the 
Campus address to Student Con
gress. In summing up the activi
ties of the government during the 
last year, he stressed twro main 
achievements. Although the gov
ernment is only in its second year 
of existence, it is doing a good 
job of supervising the many func
tions recently delegated to it, like 
Homecoming and Spring Carnival. 
What is more, Congress is begin
ning to receive recognition that it 
is the body responsible for these 
events.
The second main stride the gov
ernment has made is in smoothing 
out its internal functions. The re
lations between Executive Coun
cil and Congress have 
better this year than 
last. On top of a high 
tendance at Congress meetings, 
the committee system has begun 
to operate efficiently. . -, ~ 
Mr. Steir also had a few sugges
tions to make. He

to consider Broad Campus Prob

not fall under the jurisdiction of 
the specific governing units like 
Dorm Council and CFP.
Carnival Theme Is 
Color In Music
Color in Music will be the theme of Techs 1958 Spring 
Carnival as announced today by the Carnival Committee of 
Student Congress. The Carnival Committee, co-ch^irmaned 
by Susette Grove and Marlyn Jakub, plans to make this
?"biggest weekend of the year one 
of the most elaborate and color
ful in the history of Tech
The dates for Carnival have 
been changed from May 8, 9, 10, 
and 11 to May 1, 2, 3, and 4 in 
order to allow more time between 
Carnival and final exams rush. 
The University of Pittsburghs 
carnival will begin May 5.
The principle aim of the Carni
val Committee is participation by 
the entire campus. To achieve this, 
several innovations will be intro
duced. including new rides, a more 
Carnival-like atmosphere with a 
future date. Carnival will also 
feature two name bands for the 
Friday night jazz concert and 
Carnival Ball.
Harmony 
The theme of the Scotch n 
Soda, Harmony directly ties in 
with Carnival. Harmony, as 
previously announced, will depict 
the nineteenth century settlement 
of Old Harmony at Ambridge,

IM Night Features Steelers
This coming Friday, March 21, 
will be Carnegie Techs annual 
intramural night which will be 
held in the gym. The evenings 
events are scheduled to begin at 
7:00 and promise to be varied and 
interesting.
The mens and womens fenc
ing championship will be first on 
the agenda. This sport, rarely 
seen, but fascinating, will be 
coached by Ed Kung,
Following the completion of 
this championship, the extra fea
ture of the evening will begin. 
This year it will be a basketball 
contest between the Pittsburgh 
steelers and the IM all-stars. The 
Steelers team which will include 
such stars as Earl Morall, Len 
Dawson, Fran Rogal, Willis Mcdung, and Ted Marchibroda will

The climax of the evenings 
sports events will be the cham
pionship intramural basketball 
contest between the ATO A 
team and the Rockets. These 
same teams battled last year for 
the championship which ended in 
a victory for the Rockets. Judg
ing from this rivalry, Mr. Earl

tures. To increase our potential 
supply of good teachers for the 
schools, he said, we should 
make changes in our teacher cer
tification laws in most states. A 
person well trained in subject 
matter who has demonstrated 
ability as a teacher should not be 
barred from teaching in our 
schools by the tariff wall which 
has been erected by our teachers 
colleges and state education de
partments.
Improvements
During his address Dr. Warner 
discussed the great importance of 
bringing about an improvement 
in many of our primary and sec-*, 
ondary schools, saying that the 
poor schools should do what the 
good schools are doing. He point
ed out three areas in which manygood schools have shown the 
way:
1. The principal concern of 
good schools is for the intellectual
development of the individual 
student, through studying solid 
subjects under teachers who un
derstand these subjects. This in
volves, obviously, forgetting the 
former emphasis upon social 
awareness and life adjustment. It 
does not, however, necessarily in
terfere with the attainment of 
these two latter qualities. In fact, 
an intellectually developed stu
dent is apt to be a better adjusted 
student in the long run.
M2. Good schools require all stu
dents to study English, history, 
languages, mathematics and sci
ence as long as these subjects can 
be mastered.
3. In good schools mathematics 
and science are considered a 
proper, integral part of the liber
al education of all gifted students. 
These subjects are never reserv
ed as the province only of those 
few who commit themselves to 
careers in these fields.

Tech History
Campus Overrun By Goats; 
Situation Remedied Abruptly
By Toni Nelson
The sight of a goat on campus would probably make todays Tech 
student think he had been studying too hard or at the Greeks too long.
The west end of the campus, in front of Machinery Hall, was an 
unkempt spot. The Dean of the College of Engineering in those days 
was late to a faculty meeting one time and tried to convince his 
colleagues the delay was caused* 
by some trouble dodging goats on 
the way. His excuse most proba
bly was accepted. For many years 
a herd of goats flourished in a set
tlement of foreigners in the ad
joining Grand Canyon of the Bal
timore and Ohio Railroad. The 
livestock climbed up often to 
graze on Machinery Halls front 
lawn. This free grub situation 
came to an abrupt halt under 
rather dramatic circumstances.
The Dean of Men was con
fronted in his office one day by a 
strange woman with an angry 
voice that burst out loudly Ye 
. gotta me goat? The Dean, look
ing up from his work, beheld an 
Italian woman of gigantic pro
portions standing belligerently 
opposite his desk with arms 
akimbo and a far-from-friendly 
expression on her face.
Ye Gotta Me Goat
Ye gotta me goat? The worst 
part of the whole thing was, he 
did have her goat although he 
didnt know it. A group of his 
academic charges had borrowed 
it (without permission of course) 
to use as a mascot for the football 
game the Saturday before. In 
true student form, they had for
gotten the small detail of return
ing the borrowed property.
A little telephoning and run
ning around unearthed the facts 
of the case. The students had 
talked the dormitory porter into 
hiding the goat in a shed behind 
his own home. In fact it was re
signedly peering out of a broken 
window at the very moment the 
Dean was being accused of thiev
ery. The ex-mascot was restored 
to its rightful owner and away 
from the campus she marched, 
dragging her regained treasure 
behind her.

harder, the Automobile Club of 
Argentina sealed the hood shut at

for high altitude.
So the run began  across the 
blazing Argentine pampas, into the 
ramparts of the forbidding Andes.
Up and up the road climbed, almost 
2^ miles in the sky! Drivers 
gasped for oxygen at 12,572 feet  
but the Turbo-Thrust V8 never 
slackened its torrent of power, the 
Full Coil springs smothered every 
bump, the Turboglide transmission 
made play of grades up to 30

Editorial
Medicine At Tech
As traditional as bad food at high prices in Skibo, stu
dent apathy, Phugg (bless him) in front of EH, jello salads 
in Morewood, in fact, as traditional as the stack on Machinery 
Hall, is the scant confidence placed in the medical services 
of this school by the student body. It is distressing to find stu
dents going to doctors offcampus because they arent con
fident in the schools services. Lack of respect ruins the ef
fectiveness of our medical staff.
Indeed the staff has to cater to many more persons and 
in less time than they would normally do. Nonetheless, no 
matter how pressed for time, confidence in the treating and 
treatment must be generated. If it is impossible to do this 
with the time and personnel allotted, and if it is impossible 
to do this from the start (resulting in an initial lack of con
fidence), medical service should be suspended until it be
comes possible to alter these things.
Pill pushing, throat swabbing, and fumigating are prob
ably valuable in a limited area, but as mass cures for any
thing and everything they fail. When used as such (and this 
is the impression which most students possess) few will be 
impressed with the treator.
With the coming of the student infirmary (an idea which 
has found wide and strong support among the students, and 
an idea which deserves the closest attention of the adminis
tration) the medical services will assume a more important 
role. Their respect must be assured.
In the meantime (a rather long time, if the infirmary is 
to be in the new Activities Center) conditions must change. 
The Tartan would like to see some major changes made in the 
treatment students receive from the practitioners working 
here.

position and continued existence 
of Greek Letter organizations, if 
the indictments of E.H.R. are vaild 
and relevant.
In order to provide some basis 
for consideration I will accept 
E.H.R.s conception of the pur
poses and functions of fraterni
ties, and indeed add at least one 
more: that is, they provide spirit 
which would otherwise be com
pletely lacking. (Re: Spring Car
nival, Homecoming, etc.) It isj;air 
to point out that the editorial 
writer did not include improv
ing Grades in what he considers 
to be the functions of a fraternity. 
Yet he blasts frats for not accom
plishing this, thus denouncing fra
ternities fcft* not doing something 
he has never proved they should 
be doing. However, it is possible 
that we.may attribute this sloppy 
reasoning to the writers exhuberance and eagerness to create a 
bang-up editorial.
Further, I would like to ex
amine the points delineated in the 
Tartan at greater length. The 
writer points out that many camp
uses do very well without frater
nities. This may be true, but
E.H.R. has not shown that the 
comparison is valid: Do the same 
conditions exist at these institu
tions, .(unnamed by him) as exist 
at Tech? Namely, do these other 
schools claim to educate the 
whole m^n? Is there as high a 
percentage of commuting students 
as at Tech? Is there a notable 
lack of school spirit? Does their 
social life exist as a part of camp
us life revolving around school 
functions as ours does with fra
ternities? The author does net 
supply this information which is 
needed to uphold his contentions.
The author then goes on to say 
that the fraternities are degener
ating scholastically. This may be 
so, but he presents no figures from 
years past for comparison to prove 
this. m
The question also arises if the 
differences between the indepen
dents grades and those of the 
Greeks is of any significance. At 
best, 0.08 quality points consists 
of the difference of one* letter 
grade in a 4 unit lab course. Does 
this minute differential in marks 
constitute a basis for such a dis
play of editorial venom as the 
Tartan puts forth? Or is this sim
ply the microscosmic meanderings 
of an individual searching for 
some thing to shout about?
My conclusion is that to regain 
falling intellectual prestige the 
Tartan should consider drastic 
measures.

ObservationsI
Fraternity System 
Lessens Shock Of 
Societys Defects
Editor, the Tartan:
During the past few weeks the 
question of the worth of fratern
ities to our educational system 
has been debated by the Tartan 
and various interested observers. 
Since I am what you might call 
an interested observer, I would 
like to offer my thoughts for what 
they are worth.
As background, I have associat
ed with two fraternities; I was a 
member of one here at Tech and 
a pledge at another on a different 
campus. I have seen two fresh
man classes enter and complete 
four years. I think I have a feel 
lor this subject  the best critics
Either Ban The Bomb 
Or Else Ban Mankind
By Richard Block
We have been told by numerous people that negotiations with the 
Russians are impossible; that the Russians cannot be trusted; that 
they act only from present expedience; and so forth. Let me accent 
some of this. Perheps they cannot be trusted. It would certainly look 
that way. They did break all but three of about ten times that many 
agreements in their dealings with the Western World. Russia does 
act from present experience. And heres the loophole toward negotia
tions.
We must base our agreements upon those elements which both 
sides find expedient, even if each side has a different reason. The 
Polish plan for a central European neutral or non-nuclear zone is 
good for them but not for us. This plan would leave the zone involved 
out of nuclear thinking and render it vulnerable to the vastly su^ 
perior Soviet conventional military army. We would be unable 
retaliate on ah aggressive move with nuclear weapons and we ARE 
unable to retaliate in any other way. Check that one off.
Nuclear Testing
Now thawe a look at the plan for a two year ban on nuclear test
ing. This, it seems, is expedient to both sides. It should give neither an 
advantage and would prevent the creation of big bombc by any other 
powers. More important, it would be a first step in the direction of 
arms limitation and eventually, ceasing production of nuclear weap
ons/ This is, if were lugky. Any research toward development of a 
clean nuclear explosion could be carried on under an international 
group for the nutual benefit of all. The use of clean explosiofJ 
would be a boon to peaceful progress.
On the United States side of the fence there are many questions. 
One is, of course, inspection. I will not discuss that because we must 
all assume that unless a thoroughly acceptable inspection plan were 
arranged there would be no agreement.
Then there is Or. Edward Teller. He is a first rate problem in 
himself. He says, and quite calmly, I believe that disarmament is 
a lost cause. He also says that we cannot reup upon inspection be
cause secret tests are possible. He fails to mention that our present 
equipment has picked up small hidden explosions of our own. Howt 
ever, we cannot prove to him or to those under his influence that Rul* 
sia will not and cannot cheat. For this reason he is doubly a threat 
to any kind of negotiations.[Continued on page 8]
of the fraternity system can be 
found in the system itself.
Let us start, by accepting the 
existence of fraternities; they are 
an indispensible unit of our edu
cational system, with or without 
a national charter or greek let
ters. They offer the comforts of a 
togetherness that seem so pop
ular today. We find fraternities in 
everything but name among the 
commuters, the dorm men and 
women, the fine arts students, the 
graduate students, etc. Now, why 
do the organized fraternities come 
under such spiried and consistent 
attack?
Why Fraternities
Organization supplies some part 
of the answer. The fraternities are 
organized and can neatly be sep
arated into groups: A fraternity 
man signifies something; an ATO, 
or a Tau Delt or a Beta also sig
nifies a trait, a characterization. 
There is no such neat package or 
black and white criterion to han
dle "any other group on campus.
The fraternities proclaim high 
ideals and generous aims,-and we 
do not have to look very far to 
see the hypocrisy in their failure 
to live up to them, or for that 
matter, to even recognize them. 
(Is this so very different from 
the society that bred them?)
So, the members of the fratern
ities have comfort in their organ
ized strength and can afford to 
ignore their purpose and the peo
ple outside of themselves. Noth
ing hurts so much as to be ignor
ed, whether the person who is 
ignored is in the system or out
side of it. If we, as individuals, 
have high ideals of our own 
and see them trampled or laugh
ed at by persons who cannot see 
the value of living ideals, that is, 
living ideals other than their own, 
the hurt is very deepit goes to 
our very foundations. The trouble 
starts. We find on one hand a self 
satisfied group who seemingly 
pass an unconscious four years at 
school never aware that' they live 
outside of truth, and on the 
other hand, people sensitive to this 
truth and driven to express it.
Expression
Thus we come to the methods 
of expression. These methods can 
take different forms and the re
cent editorials and letters to the 
editor in the Tartan are examples.
I cant help but feel that these 
arguments and counter-arguments
have failed to strike at an import
ant issue. There is a lot of talk 
of intellectual motives and schol
arship and adult preparation, but 
these are only ideas and ideals; 
the stuff on which the fraternity 
were founded and, as they must, 
have failed to realize. They are 
excuses for they ignore* the real 
reason why the fraternities were 
formed to begin with. They were 
formed to give comfort, to give 
their members a security that 
comes with a group who need the 
physical and emotional sense of 
superiority that a fraternity gives 
so well.
Good Targets
In this sense the fraternities are 
ideal scapegoats for our dissatis
factions. To feel the lack of se
curity in our own values and to 
see a strong, organized group suc
cessful in their lack of our values 
are not easy things to swallow. 
It is easier to strike out against 
someone else than to examine our 
own values and have*the faith in 
them that allows us to live them 
by ourselves. 0)
One may argue for and against 
fraternities and rationalize the 
arguments along the most intel
lectual and cultural of lines imag
inable. One can hold meetings 
and formal discussions, go to con
certs or drink red wine discussing 
the merits of Dostoevsky; one can 
make grandose claims of purpose 
or lack of purpose, and still lose 
sight of the object of the discus
sion in the attempt to express ofcj 
argument in a more elegant man
ner than the other.
Basically fraternities have noth
ing to do with scholarship, for their 
nature represents a society opposed 
to the ideals of scholarship and in
dividual thought. Scholarship can 
exist among individual members 
just as it can exist anywhere else; 
the presence of the fraternity has 
nothing to do with this. No sort 
of statistics can show the revei JO, 
for no matter how scientific sta
tistics may appear, almost any
thing can be proven by the unin
telligent application of them.
Case For Fraternities
I would then like to present my 
case for the fraternity system. I 
would like to urgp fraternities to 
remain as they arenot to change, 
and to keep, all the characteristics 
that are innate in their nature ,1

Letter[continued from page 4] 
offer this proposal in all serious
ness.
Fraternities, in my eyes, repre
sent small editions of a society 
that we, as future members, must 
join and contribute to. University 
life is far removed from the ac
tual world and to remove the 
fraternities would remove this 
small connection that we have 
with it. As yet I am not interested 
in a value judgement as to the 
worth of this society; it exists and 
we must be awaire of that.
& Let us not try to change fraterni
ties into university appendages to 
reflect university attitudes, which 
in many ways are in direct oppo
sition to those which a graduate 
finds in the business world. Let 
us not talk of discussion forums, 
of attend? nee of lectures, plays or 
concerts, of elimination of timeconsuming, non-essential activi
ties (I should like to see' a defini
tion of this phrase y for these are 
tf*ot activities that are given 
value outside the university at
mosphere. Let us not force new 
values down the throats of stu
dents without giving them the 
oportunity of desiring them, of 
feeling the need for them; only 
then can they realize their worth.
Up To The Freshman
The freshman can enter college 
and join a fraternity. He can ex
perience the joys that go with this 
^-acceptance and the cammaraderie of the after-party ditty time. 
He can soak up the fraternity life 
and ideals and can pass the neces
sary, and sometimes painful, ad
justment of his' first few semesters.
Once settled in the fratern
ity he can then see and evaluate 
 and this is the start of an evalu
ation that will concern a larger
society. He can accept it blindly 
or critically; or he cannot accept 
it. He can dwell in it, satisfied 
with its benefits, wallowing in the 
ease of life that it offers him. He 
can live in it happily satisfied with 
its dual personality and glad to do 
his share in extending its life. He 
can accept it with its faults and 
seek to better it by building from 
the inside, by strengthening its 
structurenot by tearing it down.
Inside View
Finally he doesnt have to accept 
it at all. He can denounce it and 
all that goes with the fraternity 
system. But he has seen it from 
the inside; he knows whereof he 
speakssomething very few of 
the critics can claim. And this 
will eventually help him to under
stand the system and the need 
for it. He can use the system as a 
lever to the understanding of his 
own values; he has discovered 
that something is wrong and has 
discovered it early enough in life 
before he loses the ability to 
do something about it.
A system that is oriented to 
university life does not have this 
scope. The university can offer 
ideas, but it cannot offer the ex
perience of living them. To change 
a fraternity into the idea of a 
fraternity takes away the greatest 
value that the fraternity has to 
offerand that is one of close ex
perience to living in society. For 
some this experience lessens the 
shock of of a final adjustment 
after school; for others it allows 
an easy adjustment. For others it 
points out faults that are serious 
ones and this experience makes 
them recognize that they must 
try to change society and, most 
important of all, makes them real
ize the immense difficulty of the 
task.

Jim Farson Named 
As Track Coach 
For Coming Season
It was recently anounced. that 
Carnegie Techs 1958 track squad 
will be tutored by Jim Farson. An 
alumnus of W&J, Farson is a 
graduate student here, While an 
undergraduate at W&J he was a 
standout in the mile and two-mile, 
winning four varsity letters. He 
takes over the reins from Bob 
Carman, Techs runner-coach for 
the last four years.
The thinclads have been work
ing out as a group for several 
weeks. Although training has been 
hampered by poor weather condi
tions, Farson has been encourag
ed not only by the hard work of 
the returning veterans on the 
squad, but also by the early sea
son enthusiasm displayed by a 
large number of newcomers. At 
first glance this years edition 
seems to have better balance than 
last years team, but in certain 
areas lack of depth may be a pro
blem. Nevertheless, the harriers 
will be working very hard to bet
ter last years 3-4 record.
All men who are interested in 
competing on the team are urged 
to report to Coach Farson and 
begin workouts as soon as pos
sible. Details concerning training 
and equipment are available in 
the Athletic Office.

Mike Litcli Voted 
As Most Valuable
At a banquet following their 
victory in the Penn-Ohio Cham
pionship, Techs swimming team 
voted Captain Mike Litch the 
most valuable player and elected 
Ross Engleman captain for next 
year.
Mike, who has been a standout 
for the last four years finished 
his Tartan svv* nmlng career by 
gaining a third and first in the 
championships and anchoring the 
400 yard freestyle relay to new 
Penn-.. Ohio League and Tech 
school records. Mike also holds 
the school record in the 200 yard 
butterfly.
Engleman
Ross Engleman who won the 
440 yard freestyle championship 
as a sophomore last year placed 
third in his specialty this year. 
Ross also swam the anchor leg of 
the Penn-Ohio Championship 
medley relay.
Tech loses five seniors this year: 
Mike Litch (freestyle), Frank 
Shuck (backstroke), Tony Chamay (freestyle), Grumpy Renshaw (backstroke), and Hal Pas 
trick (diving). This is a big loss 
but the swimming team hopes to 
duplicate this years champion
ship next year, as eight lettermen 
will return paced by the entire 
medley relay and all the distance 
freestylers.
Obelisks Sweep 
Wrestling Finals
Last Thursday in the All-School 
Wrestling Tournament, a strong 
Obelisk squad took the team 
award by winning four individual 
championships and accumulating 
12 V2 points.
A total of six teams entered 22 
men in the tournament. Beta 
Theta Pi with only two entrees 
took second place behind Obelisk 
with 6 points.
Jim Milligan and Ray Benzinger each took their third cham
pionship. The tournament was a 
fine indication that Tech has the 
wrestelrs to represent Carnegie 
in the newly formed West Penn 
Conference.

Friday night it will be ATO-A 
against the Rockets for the in
tramural basketball championship. 
ATO, blessed with height and a 
strong bench, has again over
whelmed its fraternity opposition, 
and the Rockets, possessing ver
satility and unmatched strength, 
have breezed through more than 
sixteen consecutive victories over 
a two or three year period.
Last year in the championships, 
the Rockets topped ATO, giving 
the crown to the independents. 
This year, the fraternity squad is 
out to recapture the title; thus In
tramural Night should provide 
some of the best basketball of the 
season.
First Round
In the first round of the playoffs. 
Kappa Sigma trounced Beta Theta 
Pi 53-23, ATO-B squeaked by 
Delta Tau Delta 37-33, and Tau 
Delta Phi upset SAE-A 43-30 in the 
fraternity competition. Indepen
dents saw two tight, action-packed 
games when the powerful Grad 
Iggles nosed out TKA 42-37, and
the Englishmen overcame a 12 
point third quarter deficit to down 
Citcom 54-51. In the latter game, 
the Englishmen jumped to a 24-
19 halftime advantage but Citcom 
rallied back in the third quarter, 
outscoring the Scot League cham
pions 21-4. But the Englishmen 
again found their eye, tallied 26 
points in the final period, and won 
the game.
Quarter Finals
The quarter finals saw tired, but 
valiant, ATO-B defeated 50-19 by 
the alert Kappa Sigs. Lou Montini led the victors with 17 points, 
and hit on 7 of 8 foul shots. Jerry 
Watson held second honors with
12 points. The Englishmen, nar
row victors over Citcom the night 
before, managed to check ASCEs 
big men, Paul Sucevic and John 
Ralston, to pull out a 54-42 win. 
Jim Biesler held individual hon
ors with 19 points; Dave Densmore 
topped the losers with 15 points, 
and Jack Mehalko of the English
men followed with 14.
The defending champion Rockets 
found it was all they could do to

Rockets vs Englishmen
seconds remaining, the score stood 
35-32. Then ATO added a quick 
field goal, and two foul shots after 
regulation time had expired, to 
defeat Kappa Sigma 39-32. Frank 
Sobolewski was high man for the 
winners with 9 points; both Earl 
Benner and Lou Montini tallied 
the same for Kappa Sigma.
In truly one of the best games 
played in many years of IM com
petition, the Rockets downed the 
Englishmen 59-47. Said Mr. Earl 
J. Birdy, Director of IM Athletics, 
>The teams looked like two col
lege teams out there on the floor. 
Boyd Doxtader provided a spec
tacular demonstration of shooting 
skill as he swished eight consecu
tive one-hand jump shots, and
Tragerser kept the Englishmen 
constantly alert and tight as he 
drove time after time. He finished 
with 17 points. The losers also had (J) 
two outstanding performers, John 
Valley, who led the Englishmen 
with 18 points tallied on onehanders from the right corner, 
and Jack Mehalko, who sparked 
the team with his rebounding and 
driving and finished with 12 
points.
Impartial observers stated that 
the IM basketball playoffs provided the best basketball seen onv 
campus in nearly seven years. The 
players are good, and the teams 
even better. See the climax of the 
1958 season Friday, March 21, in

In October, 1957, only four years after 
graduation, Stanley W. Smith was ap
pointed District Plant Engineer in North
western Bell Telephone Company. Here 
Stan tells what his responsibilities are 
and how his promotion came about.
Im responsible for outside plant en
gineering in a district which includes 
about one-third of all Bell telephones in 
Nebraska outside of Omaha, Stan says. 
That's about 35,000 phones, and the 
number is growing every day.
The most important part of my job is 
to plan for growth and have facilities 
ready when needed. This means planning 
for pole lines, aerial and underground 
cable, and conduit lines to the central 
office. I also make cost estimates for all
planned construction so that money can 
be budgeted for it.
This is the kind of job I really like 
one which combines engineering and* 
management. And it was the continuing 
growth of the business, Stan points out, 
that opened up this new assignment for 
me. My predecessor was appointed to a 
newly created position and I was selected 
to replace him.
What the future holds for me depends 
on a lot of things. But I can see from my 
present job that growth will keep open
ing opportunities for myself and other 
engineers like me. Im more convinced 
than ever that the telephone company is 
the place to get ahead in an interesting 
and challenging career.
Stan Smith graduated from the University of Nebraska in 
1953 with a B.S. in E.E. degree. He is one of many young

Industrial Administration.
The program, according to Dr. 
G. L. Bach, Dean of the GSIA, is 
Carnegies response to a major 
problem facing American indus
trythe shortage of broadly 
.trained men for top management.
3ecause many men have accum
ulated most of their business ex
perience in a single department, 
Dean Bach says, they have not 
acquired the broadened require
ments for top management assign
ments, though they are already 
experts in one or more areas of 
administration.
During their nine-week stay at 
Carnegie the executives will con
centrate on courses in business 
Cpoliey, financial administration, 
human and labor relations, and 
other broad-gauge aspects of the 
American economy. An addition
al area of special study, a unique 
part of the program for execu
tives, is the seminar in the ap
praisal of new ideas and tech
niques in business administration. 
Members of the GSIA faculty, 
headed by Dr. DeWitt C. Dear
born, administrator, will conduct 
(The classes.
Varied Businesses Represented 
This years group of partici
pants, selected from a cross sec
tion of businessmen, includes ex
ecutives of many different types 
of American manufacturing firms, 
and of several financial institu
tions, transportation companies, 
and foreign corporations. The ma
jority of the visitors are in their 
forties and have had about tweny years of successful business ex
perience. They have been granted 
nine-week leaves of absence from 
their employers in order to live 
in on a full-time basis during the 
program.
Highlighting each week of the 
program will be an informal din
ner session with a distinguished 
visitor from business, labor, or 
government. The guest will speak 
briefly, and there will be time for 
^informal questioning and discus^ sion with everything off the 
record.

you juggle, dance, walk tight
ropes, sing, do card tricks? Do 
you play in a combo or belong

to faculty members wishing to 
protect their families.
The actual donation days will be 
Tuesday and Wednesday, April 15 
and 16. From April 9 there will be 
a table in Skibo at which you can 
sign up for a definite hour to give 
blood. The donations will be con
ducted at the Black Cat Lounge by 
a Red Cross Bloodmobile staffed 
by three doctors and four nurses 
and equipped with eight cots. Cof
fee and doughnuts will be served 
to donors.
Veterans Club
At Pitt during a similar cam
paign this month, less than 100 
pints of blood were raised. Tech, 
however, last year got 120 pints 
and the Veterans Club expects to 
increase the amount considerably 
this year. The club earnestly de
sires to enlist the cooperation of 
every student and administration 
member in order to succeed in this 
most worthwhile cause.
Each week the Veterans Hos
pital needs from 75 to 100 pints of 
blood and is currently raising only 
13 to 20 Qints. Consequently, the 
Central Blood Bank has agreed to 
supply the hospital at no cost with 
this necessary blood. And this 
blood can be acquired only 
through campaigns such as this.

Carnival Ball. The theme is offi
cially defined as the humorous 
'endering of the idea of a song 
or songs with a color used as an 
adjective in the title. Sorority, 
fraternity, and independent com
mittees will carry the Color in

last year will remember the large 
turn out  stags and drags. The 
gym was packed to capacity, es
pecially for the much anticipated 
Rockets  ATO basketball con
test. This year it is' expected that 
there will be even a larger turout, 
thus it would be wise to get there 
early to be assured of a good seat 
as well as to see the preliminary

Observations
[continued from page 4] 
France: Pig-Headed
France is on the brink of the 
A-bomb. She may test a bomb in 
the summer or fall. She may want 
to test and develop more and bet
ter bombs before the year is out. 
Naturally, she is staunchly op
posed to a test ban. The United 
States has strong bargaining pow
er with France. There is a possible 
trade in the offering: France to ar
range a quick conclusion to the 
Algerian rebellion and settle her 
pig-headedness in all of North 
Africa; the United States to see 
that the bomb testing ban gets 
shelved. This would be inexcus
able! In the first place, we should 
never bargain away our work to
ward peace. Second, we should 
force France to settle the ridicu
lous situation with Algeria with
out bribes.
As it stand* now, Ike will go to 
the summit meeting with a test 
ban proposal. This plan is almost 
the same plan submitted by Har
old Stassen who was recently fired 
for too much arguing with the 
Dulles-Teller-Co-President Adams
faction. Lets hope that the plan 
will get to the summit and sur
vive there.
Up To Everyone
Blind optimism is pretty worth
less^ and very disappointing but 
utter defeatism or resolution to 
status quo is equally bad. We must 
keep trying to work toward peace, 
and in the right direction. We 
must not stop until we die. If man 
could not hope for something bet
ter than the world he has created 
for himself he would not have 
much to live for. Yet it is each in
dividuals sole responsibility to 
create the better world he desires. 
About three weeks ago Harry 
Truman said we would be for
given if we spend too much for 
peace, but never forgiven if we do 
not spend enough. It is our duty 
and if there is a war we must be 
willing to accept the responsibility 
for having caused it.
It seems that the only think we 
have in the United States that the 
Soviet Union is without is God. 
We have schools of theology, they 
have none. I wouldnt count on 
this to help us out of trouble. It 
has failed too often. For one rea
son or another we always are able 
to rationalize Gods not supporting
us. The fact remains, he doesnt 
always protect our side. How can 
He? In most wars both sides are 
fighting in His name. Anyone who 
believes in his cause believes that 
God si on his side. So whatever 
happens, lets blame it on our
selves and expect nothing from 
God. Were responsible for our
selves.
Killing
The truth is, says I. F. Stone, 
that belief in force and violence 
seems to be the one creed all man
kind holds in common, fraternally 
linking even a Dulles and a 
Krushchev. Anthropologists do in
deed tell us that not all tribes are 
warlike, but the other kind are 
hard to locate, except in reserva
tions. Everywhere men assume 
that they have a right to kill other 
men in defense of what they con
sider to be their vital interests. 
Since one mans vital interest is 
often another mans hurt, the car
nage is difficult to equate with any 
morality. This universal com
placency about killing ... is the 
heart of the peace problem. Ul
timate weapons in the hands of a 
species so badly conditioned make 
it urgent.
Oh, I dont know. What eternal
so what? Who cares? What diffe 
ance can it possibly make?
value does contemporary civiliza
tion (or Russia and the United 
States, etc.) have in the complete 
history of the earth? Does it really 
matter? So what if we destroy the 
world life as we know it now? 
There are places in Africa and 
South America, etc. where civili
zation could someday begin to 
grow uncontaminated. And if not,
even possible that we are merely 
part of an often repeated cycle 
wherein a civilization is wholly 
created and destroyed every ten 
thousand years or so. Who knows? 
The earth will continue regardless 
of what we do. It is solely our de
cision to make as to whether or 
not we will remain here. It is en
tirely up to us(to decide and ac
cept the responsibilities and con
sequences of that decision. Ji(jf) 
you and me.
The man at the bar finished his 
second beer and then asked the 
bartender how many kegs of beer 
he sold each week. Thirty-five was 
the answer. The man replied, Ive 
thought of a way you can sell 70. 
The manager was startled. 
How? Its simplefill up the 
glasses.
