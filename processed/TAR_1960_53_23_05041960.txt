ostumes Mark 
Bemix Arts Ball
The climax of last weeks Fine 
Arts Week was the Beaux Arts 
Ball held last Saturday night in 
the Fine Arts Building. Attend
ance was limited to Fine Arts stu
dents and their dates; everyone 
was in costume. Once upon a 
time . . . was the theme, so that 
historical and mythological char
acters were in abundance. The 
first floor of the Fine Arts build
ing, where the Ball was held, was 
decorated like a medieval castle. 
At nine oclock the grand March 
began, and the elaborate cos
tumes were the product of much 
work and imagination. Queen of 
the Fairies, Snow White, Oberon, 
Wendy, elves, Medusa, and Malifi$it were some of the characters 
portrayed. Whiskey Sour was 
presented at eleven-thirty. This 
was a musical entertainment with 
lyrics by Mike Alfreds and music 
by Kip Cohen; many Drama stu
dents were included in the cast.
Fine Arts week consisted of an 
art display in Exhibition Hall 
which gave everyone an oppor
tunity to see th students work, 
and several musical presentations 
'Eluding some original works. 
ne of these, Anthemion Suite, 
will be given again on May 13.

5-Point Development Program 
Meets 1957 Predictions
In April, 1957, Carnegie Tech 
announced a ten-year multi-mil
lion dollar development program 
centered on men and facilities. 
The program had five objectives:
1. An increase in faculty sal
aries
2. Additional outstanding teach
ers for the faculty
3. Construction of new campus 
buildings
4. Improvement of existing fa
cilities
5. Extensive campus improve
ments
In April, 1960, exactly three 
years later, the success of this 
program is apparent in the rap
idly changing face of the Carnegie
Tech campus.
Two new buildings have already 
been completed and are in use, 
three more are currently under 
construction, and preliminary 
plans have been submitted for an
other. Additions to older build
ings have started, (one is almost 
complete), and campus improve
ments, including the construction' 
of an on-campus athletic facility, 
which includes a new football 
stadium, should be near comple
tion by fall.
The two completed buildings, 
Mudge Graduate House Addition 
and the Robert E. Doherty Grad
uate House, both dedicated in the 
fall of 1959, were designed to alle. ORDER BLANK FOR THE

viate the problem of graduate stu
dent housing. The original Mudge 
House, a gift of Edwin Webster 
and Pauline Seeley Mudge, was 
first occupied by 50 Carnegie 
graduate male students in 1957. 
The addition, completed in July, 
1959, houses 90 students, thus giv
ing Carnegie accommodations for 
140 male graduate students. The 
Robert E. Doherty Graduate 
House, dedicated in honor of the 
late Carnegie president (1936-50), 
houses 52 married graduate stu
dents in one-bedroom and effi
ciency apartments. * It provides an 
extensive laundry area in the
basement, including washer and 
dryer facilities, a paved play area 
for children and a parking area 
for 52 cars.
The first of the three new build
ings currently under construction 
to be completed will be the Cam
pus Activities Center which will 
be ready for use by the incoming 
students next September. The 
laying of the cornerstone will take 
place in early May. This multi
purpose building is designed to 
serve the needs of students and

Dear Editor:
The Tartan of last week, April 
27, in addition to carrying the 
monthly progress report on the 
apathy index of the Tech student, 
had a small, incoherent letter by 
one Lester Brickman. This notor
ious gentleman of recent Thistle 
reorganization fame has taken it 
upon himself to be the conscience 
of Carnegie Tech. As the self
chosen liberator of the masses of 
Tech students, he has initiated 
various failing crusades against 
the branches of student govern
ment. His most recent endeavor 
was a malicious attack against 
Mens Dormitory Council  an 
attack which had no foundation

Editor, the Tartan:
Before making any mention of 
panty raids (which in our minds 
have become nauseating by now) 
we would like to point out that, 
as a graduate student, Mr. Manacher is in no way controlled by 
undergraduate actions nor rules. 
However, we were glad to see 
that he took enough interest in the 
matter to stand up for what he 
considered just. Now also let us 
say that if he could see the files 
of the Supreme Court, he would 
agree that we have been lenient 
as common sense will allow.
Concerning the right of assem
bly, we think the following holds. 
People in any number may as

time so directed (unless there is a 
public hazard involved, e.g. plac

will accommodate only one hund

To whom it may concern:
Whats happened to the honor 
and integrity of the Carnegie Tech 
student? Speaking from experi
ence in the mens dormitory, it 
would appear that this honor and 
integrity has fallen to a low ebb; 
so low, in fact, that many resi
dents are afraid to keep valuable 
things in their rooms. A similar 
feeling of mistrust seems to pre
vail throughout the entire cam
pus.
What is it that causes this wide
spread mistrust? Its an old pro
blem that has existed both in and 
outside dormitories for many 
years  the problem of theft. It 
exists in many forms, both large 
and small. To dramatize the pro
blem in the dormitories, and its 
special urgency this year, we pre
sent the following instances and 
examples, selected from many:
1. A resident of Welch Hall had
Open House
except in the mind of one Lester 
Brickman.
For Mr. Brickmans information, 
open house at Tech is designed 
to allow parents, relatives, girl 
friends, etc., to visit his dorm and 
his individual room; to see how 
he lives and where he spends 
most of his time. It is not de
signed for lengthy conversation in 
bimonthly meetings of old or new 
friends of the opposite sex.
1 seriously doubt that the de
mand for the increased frequency 
of open house is as great as Mr. 
Brickman seems to imply. How
ever, the presentation of a signed 
petition of dormitory residents 
who are honestly willing to:
Panty Raids
the crowd may be asked to dis
perse. If the crowd does not do 
so, action may be taken to dis
perse them. (This can be accom
plished legally by the law en
forcing body which in our case 
is the Pittsburgh police). In order 
to disperse a crowd, the police 
may take any action they see fit 
including arresting innocent on
lookers at the extreme periphery 
of the crowd. However, the Court 
wishes to stress that it will judge 
each case on its own merit i.e. 
taking into consideration any mit
igating circumstances which may 
be present.
The reprinting of last years 
statement may have been some
what blunt. However, there was a 
desire to get through to people 
that are not as sensitive as Mr. 
Manacher. It is these people who 
start derogatory activity, not the 
others.
We all realize that when a 
group of Tech students enters the
Thieving
his coat stolen in the fall and 
spent most of the winter bundled 
up in sweaters and a light jacket.
2. A resident of Boss Hall had 
his entire record collection  the 
accumulation of many years  
valued at well over $100.00  
taken from his locked room.
3. Other residents of Boss Hall 
have lost a tape recorder and an 
entire hi-fi system. v
4. Many residents have lost 
items of clothing. Many others 
have lost slide rules and books.
5. Several times, the vending 
machines in the dormitories were 
vandalized and merchandise tak
en-from them. This has happened 
quite often with the cigarette ma
chines.
6. Donner Hall Office, itself, was 
broken into and money was taken 
from the cash drawer. This inci
dent bears all thp earmarks of a 
professional effort.
Where will this end?
1. sacrifice Sunday afternoon 
routine,
2. leave their doors open during 
visitation hours,
3. submit to room inspection 
prior to open house, and
4. in general, live in a more 
formal atmosphere than they are 
accustomed to
would cause the highly reactior^-) 
ary Council to seriously recon
sider its decision. As the situation 
presently stands, the Council 
agrees with Mr. Brickman that 
his suggestion was impractical and 
unworkable.

upper floors of Morewood, these 
individuals are not going to hurt 
the reputations of the girls nor 
their own reputations. But then the 
newspapers get wind of the a< 
tivity and blow it all out of pro
portion. It is the latter feature 
which brings derogatory publicity 
to Tech and hurts our reputation 
as a group of mature and consci
entious students.
We feel that there should be 
some activity which can be used 
to alleviate youthful energy. We 
have heard that Mr. Manacher {j 
a very intelligent person. Perhaps 
he can help us find a solution to 
the problem.

Every community has its 
thieves. In general, however, tf> 
more educated the community, the 
fewer thieves that community has. 
But the community at Carnegie 
Tech seems to be the exception. 
Carnegie Tech has more than its 
shore of thieves and thievery. Is 
it that a great many Carnegie 
Tech students are ignorant, incon
siderate, and just plain dishonest? 
We think not. But then how (*,>} 
we explain the thefts? Is it from 
excitement? Is it for need? Why 
the thefts?.
We of Mens Dormitory Council 
cannot find the complete answer, 
but we are doing our best to com
bat the problem directly. With this 
in mind, we hope that our letter, 
by bringing this problem to the 
attention of the student body, will 
aid us in reaching our goal  the 
eventual elimination of thefts fi) 
the dormitories.

Editors note:
The problem of stealing is also true in the women's dormitories too. The questions 
raised by Men's Dormitory Council apply in other areas of resident living besides just 
their realm of jurisdiction.

case usually closes her eyes, 
thrusts her neck forward, and re
mains motionless, waiting in an
ticipation. She is obviously an 
amateur and therefore a greedy 
kisser since she has no technique 
and from experience knows there 
will be no encore.
Be careful just before you kiss 
this type that you don't conscious
ly shape your lips the same way 
or youll be so far apart that it 
would be better to write. The way 
to work this type is to tell her 
something funny after she gets all 
set. Then, when she starts to smile, 
do your stuff.
The last study is the girl who 
has recently applied a thick coat
ing of lipstick, and here you must 
look out for skidding. This kiss 
should not be hurried, but made 
with deliberation because if you 
rush it you may slip off her lips 
and swallow her earring. To swal
low an earring is not so bad unless 
she is wearing long drops. You 
will find this variety to be most 
indigestible. When kissing this 
type it is most important to ap
proach the target from the per
pendicular and execute with slow 
precision and careful aim.

U. S. Air Force Navigator. As a 
flying officer on the Aerospace 
team, he has chosen a career of 
^dership, a career that has 
meaning, rewards and executive 
opportunity.
The Aviation Cadet Program 
is the gateway to this career. To 
qualify for this rigorous and pro
fessional training, a h/gh school 
diploma is required ; however, two 
or more years of college are highly 
desirable. Upon completion of the 
program the Air Force encourages 
ie new officer to earn his degree 
 he can better handle the respon
sibilities of his position. This in
cludes full pay and allowances 
while taking off-duty courses un
der the Bootstrap education pro
gram. The Air Force will pay a 
substantial part of all tuition costs. 
After having attained enough 
credits so that he can complete 
course work and residence require
ments for a college degree in 6 
Months or less, he is eligible to 
apply for temporary duty at the 
school of his choice.
If you think you have what it 
takes to earn the silver wings of 
an Air Force Navigator, see your 
local Air Force Recruiter. Ask

regarded as extraneous and rather

Proof
At one school, where I spoke 
about the need for personal com
mitment in the making of a safer 
an| better world, a student came 
^afterwards and expressed his 
distaste for what he had just 
heard. He said his scientific train
ing had taught him to look for 
proof; but that he had listened 
carefully and had come to the con
clusion that I hadnt proved any
thing I had said.
I thanked the young man for his 
comment and agreed with him 
that my propositions contained no 
proof and that, indeed, it was 
doubtful whether they could be 
proved at all in advance of the 
event. I pointed out, however, 
that one definition of a good edu
cation was that it enabled a man 
to develop values that were -worth 
holding even without proof. In
deed we might have to bet our 
lives on some propositions that 
could not be proved except by 
history.
Big Gap
r-Jhe student replied by saying 
tHTit he didn't doubt my sincerity 
but that he still felt there was a 
big gap between his scientific 
training and the things I had ask
ed him to believe.
If you see an elephant in this ink blot, your problem is 
youve never met one. Because an elephant doesnt 
look anything like this blot. Like some of the new 
cars, he has a trunk in the front. He also has more 
in the way of ears than anyone really needs.
We know about elephants because we have seen 
them in the movies. We know about L*M filter ciga
rettes because we make them.
You can learn a lot about elephants by simply look
ing at them, but you have to smoke an L*M to know 
that L*M has found the secret that unlocks flavor in 
a filter cigarette. And to know that in todays L>M, 
with its patented Miracle Tip, fine tobaccos can be 
blended not to suit a filter but to suit your taste.
We suggest you go to the movies and look at some 
elephants. And try an L*M.

I have no way of knowing 
whether the student was typical. 
I do know, however, that there 
does seem to be a resistance to 
ideas among many of the young 
people in science today. This fact, 
if fact it be, adds to my concern 
about higher education in Amer
ica today. It also increases my 
appreciation of those students, 
however few, who seem connected 
and concerned.

New Members
Last Sunday, Eta chapter of 
Cwens initiated 22 freshmen girls 
into membership. At the combined 
dinner and ceremony, the elect
ed officers of the 1960-61 Cwens 
were named. They are: President, 
Jane Scott; Vice-President, Lacretia Bowdoin; Secretary, Sara 
Harris, and Treasurer, Carla 
Blank. These officers will lead 
the chapter in their many activi
ties during the coming year. Some 
of these activities include helping 
at Freshman Orientation, working 
during registration, and selling 
Mums during Homecoming.
The outgoing officers who initi
ated the new members are Presi
dent, Bonnie McIntosh; VicePresident, Suzanne Burr; Secre
tary, Ruth Kibler, and Treasurer, 
Dorothea Tsgaris.
Kissing
B.v Ron Wertel
The problem of sloppy kissing is 
of growing magnitude on the Tech 
campus. Its cause, obviously, is the 
strange lips,found on the faces of 
Morewood females. Tech men are 
forced to kiss the oddest, most 
impossible types conceivable. To 
correct the problem, the kisser in 
question should learn to recognize 
the basic types and learn the 
method of attack best suited to 
each situation.
First of these is the athletic lips, 
the type that automatically pucker 
into a hard, doughnut-like ring. 
Depending on the girls shade of 
lipstick, these lips look like an 
orange, cherry, or grape Lifesaver. 
This same type sometimes holds 
her lips in such a tight, straight 
line you feel you are kissing a 
crack in the sidewalk. To control 
this kind, ask the girl a question 
and, when she relaxes her lips to 
talk, kabong.
Then there is the girl who con^ 
verses all during the kiss. Shes 
the one whose lips are as dry as 
the sphinx nose and who talks 
out of the side of her mouth wiiile 
you try to hold a kiss like a fam
ous screen lover. The remedy for 
this is very simple. Just hold her 
so tight she cant breathe. When 
a girl cant breathe, she cant talk.
Similar to the athletic are the 
cornet type lips. The girl in this

well on its way towards comple
tion and will be ready for the be
ginning of the next school year. 
The building will be dedicated as 
Hamerschlag Hall in honor of Car
negies first president and will cost 
approximately $1,000,000. It will 
enable the institution to better 
meet the needs of resident stu
dents. In the past few years, a 
trend towards more and more outof-state students entering Carnegie 
has become apparent, and now ap
proximately 1700 students reside 
on campus.
'A model for the new Alan M. 
Scaife Hall of Engineering has 
already been submitted and pre
liminary plans are being drawn. 
The building, made possible by a 
gift of $1,250,000 from the Sarah 
Mellon Scaife Foundation will 
house a nuclear science and en
gineering laboratory and will fur
nish space for the further ex
pansion of graduate work and re
search. It will also make possi
ble increased enrollment in graduata studies in engineering and sci
ence.
Other projects currenly in prog
ress include the construction Ov a 
Studio Practice Theater, which is 
almost completed, for the Depart
ment of Drama, and an addition 
to Porter Hall, the oldest building 
on the Carnegie campus, which 
will provide new classroom and 
office facilities.
Work on the new on-campus 
football field and athletic facility 
started earlier this month and it is 
expected that the field will V>e 
ready for the start of the football 
season in September. This will 
mark the first time in more than 
30 years that Carnegie Tech has 
played a bootball game on cam
pus.
Three years ago, Carnegie for 
the first time, called upon her 
many friends to help strengthen 
her position as one of the leading 
centers of liberal professional ed
ucation. The enthusiasm wHh 
which the program has been ia*- 
ceived is shown in the above prog
ress report.
Thus far, more than $22,000,000 
has been raised to help Carnegie 
Tech meet its five objectives 
stated in 1957.

Four Freshmen Entertainment 
Promises Excellent Program
History
The Four Freshmen became a vocal group at Arthur 
Jordan Conservatory in Indianapolis in 1948 while they 
were in their freshmen year. Their sound started with a 
distinctive barbershop flavor. After a few months of
literally singing for their sup-* 
pers, they conceived the idea of 
trying to get a five-voice sound 
with only four voices.
This germ of an idea has grown 
and has been polished and per
fected until today the Four Fresh
men stand at the head of the class, 
known throughout the country for 
their distinctive original style.
Contract 
One night in 1950 they were 
playing in Dayton, Ohio. A local 
disc jockey and strong booster
The Four Freshmen
took Stan Kenton to hear them. 
One audition was all he needed 
to send them to Hollywood, sign 
them to a Capitol Recording con
tract, and give them the push that 
propelled them to stardom.
Since 1951, and their highly 
successful single of DAY BY 
DAY, the Four Freshmen have 
had a succession of hits, including 
GRADUATION DAY, CHARMAINE, JULIE IS HER NAME, 
and WHISTLE ME SOME 
BLUES, and topped by their albums, VOICE IN MODERN, 
FRESHMEN FAVORITES AND 
FIVE TRUMPETS, FOUR 
FRESHMEN AND FIVE SAXES, 
VOICES IN LATIN, and FOUR 
FRESHMEN IN PERSON. 
Appearances 
Coupled with their recording 
successes have been appearances 
in Rich, Young and Pretty, the 
Ray Anthony Television Show, 
numerous guest spots in other net
work TV shows, and outstanding 
success in concert appearances at 
colleges and ballrooms throughout 
the country. In 1958 the Fresh
men were featured in the Nat 
Cole-Ted Heath concert tour. 
Instrumental 
A unique feature of the Four 
Freshmen is the fact that they 
provide their own instrumental 
accompanimenta fact that per
mits them almost unlimited ver
satility in concert performances. 
They each are outstanding in
strumentalists, appealing to audi
ences visually as well as vocally 
and instrumental:^.
Bob Flanigan sings the top 
voice, pi a y s trombone, and 
doubles on bass. Don Barbour, the 
second voice, is featured on many 
solos and play guitar. Ross Bar
bour handles all the introductions, 
sings third voice, and plays drums 
and trumpet. Ken Albers, the bass 
voice in the group, plays trumpet, 
and mello-phone and is featured 
solo-wise both vocally and instrumentally. Bob, Ross, and Don are 
original members of the group, 
and are all from Indiana. Ken, 
who replaced Ken Eerrair with 
the Freshmen in April, 1956, hails 
from New Jersey.

Auother must" while in London is a visit to Buckingham 
Palace. Frequently in the afternoons Her Majesty the Queen 
comes .out on the balcony of the palace and waves to her loyal 
subjects below. The loyal subjects wave back at the Queen. 
However, they only continue to wave as long as Her Majesty 
is waving. This of course is the origin of Wave lengths from which 
we have derived numerous benefits including radio, television 
and the A&P Gypsies.
Be sure also when you are in London to visit the palace of 
the Duke of Marlborough. Marlbormgh is spelled Marlborough, 
but pronounced Marlboro. English spelling is very quaint but 
terribly disorganized. The late George Bernard Shaw, author of 
Jo's Boys, fought all his life to simplify English spelling. He 
once asked a friend, What does g-h-o-t-i spell? The friend 
pondered a bit and replied, Goatee. Shaw sniggered. Pshaw/* 
said Shaw. G-h-o-t-i does not spell goatee. It spells fish. Gh 
as in enough, o as in women, ti as in motion.
It must be remembered, however, that Shaw was a vegetarian 
which, all in all, was probably a good thing. As Disraeli once 
remarked to Guy Fawkes, If Shaw were not a vegetarian, no 
lamb chop in London would be safe.
But I digress. We were speaking of the palace of the Duke of 
Marlboroughor Ma lboro, as it is called in the United States. 
It is called Marlboro by every smoker who knows flavor did 
not go out when filters came in. Be sure you are well supplied 
with Marlboros when you make your trip abroad. After a long, 
tiring day of sightseeing, there is nothing so welcome as a fine, 
flavorful Marlboro and a foot bath with hot Epsom salts.
Epsom salts can be obtained in England at Epsom Downs. 
Kensington salts can be obtained at Kensington Gardens, Al
bert salts can be obtained at Albert Hall, Hyde salts can be 
obtained at Hyde Park, and the crown jewels can be obtained 
at the Tower of London.
Well sir, now you know all you need to know about England. 
Next week we will visit the Iiand of the Midnight SunFrance.

Monday in their fourth West Penn 
conference track meet. Usually 
the doormat of the conference,

meets so far this year and will 
have a home track advantage in

The team came close to pulling 
a big upset in last Saturdays 
meet with Grove City. The Tar
tans were in front by a score of 
54 Vs to 4923 after 12 events, but 
the Grovers swept the javelin and 
took 1-3 in the discus and broad 
jump to win, 702s to'60V3.

time of the year in the mile, a 
4:40.6, and came back to defeat

miles.

Furman Smith won the 220 low 
hurdles and took second in the 
broad jump with a leap of 18- 
1TV-.. Guy Beatty took the 120 
high hurdles and was second in 
the lows. Another freshman, Den
nis Gary, eame out for the first 
time this year to win the 220 yard 
dash and to take second in the 
100.
Bob Dent won the pole vault 
with his best leap of the year, 
11-3, and Jim Sharkey was first 
in the high jump at 5-6
The cindermen absorbed a very 
bad defeat at the hands of a 
classy Slippery Rock team on 
April 23. Larry Schmitz was 
Techs only winner, in the broad 
jump, as the Rockets literally ran 
away with the meet by a score of 
110-21. In the feature race of the 
day, frosh Ange Gioscia defeated 
Bruce Dobras with a fast time of 
9:56 for two miles.

and catcher Rog Swiggert lead an 
otherwise average team. The Fal
cons, this years varsity basket
ball team, have plenty of power 
but no pitching. The E.E. Grads 
have Paul Dosik, Ben Patz, and a 
fairly decent pitcher in Dick 
Wiley. However, neither of the 
latter two teams seem to have 
enough to beat jhe Kappa Sigs.
The termination of the second 
game Wednesday night will end 
the first round of play. The game 
will find the winner of Mondays 
ATO-PiKA game opposing the 
winner of the Vets Club-Met 
Grads game. The latter is the one 
which is expected to settle sec
ond place in the Indians league. 
This statement is made because 
the Met Grads are expected to 
win even though they were tied 
by the Vets Club 7-7 in a regu
lation game. Nevertheless, the 
Grads will probably win the re
match placing themselves in sole 
possession of second place.
Quarter-Finals
Thursday wall show the first 
game of the quarter-finals being 
played between the winner of the 
BSR B-PKT game and the win
ner of Mondays SAE-Newman 
Club game. The latter winner is 
expected to win this game due to 
their better personnel. SAE re
turns with Bob Miller, Bob Reber, 
Chuck Vodvarka, Bill Kraynek, 
and Charley Nelson to give them 
strong hitting, pitching, and de
fense. Newman Club strength is 
represented in Dick Fitzgerald 
and Dennis Gary.
The second game Thursday 
night will be between the winner 
of the E.E. Grads-Falcons game 
and the BTP-(PiKA-ATO loser) 
winner. The Betas are expected 
to be the winner of both games.
The first game of Friday night 
will be between the Tuesday game 
winners and should pit GSIA 
versus the Beta Sigs. The second 
game on Friday night will find 
the Wednesday game winners op
posing each other. Like the Betas, 
the expected winner is KS. Thu, 
the following four teams are expected to be found in the play
offs in the semi-finals: GSIA A, 
SAE, KS, and BTP.
The semi-finals, finals, and con
solation games are to be played 
the week after next. The upper 
bracket semi-final game is to be 
played Monday starting at 5:00, 
the lower bracket semi-final, 
Tuesday 5:00. The consolation 
game should start at 5:00 on Wed
nesday, and the final game should 
be played on Thursday, May 19, 
at 5:00. The same rule about rain 
will prevail for these games.

EUROPE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1
Summer vacation is just around the corner, and naturally all of 
you are going to Europe. Perhaps I can offer a handy tip or 
two. (I must confess I have never been to Europe myself, but , f 
I eat a lot of Scotch broth and French dressing, so I am not 
entirely without qualification.)
- First let me say that no trip to Europe is complete without 
a visit to England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Germany, 
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Lichtenstein, Holland, Belgium, Switzer
land, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Po
land, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia, 
Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Crete, Sardinia, Sicily, Hungary, 
Romania, Bulgaria, I>apland, and Andorra.
Let us take up these countries in order. First, England. ( ^ 
The capital of England is Loudonor Liverpool, as it is 
sometimes called. There are many interesting things to see in 
Londonchiefly, the changing of the guards. The guards an 
changed daily. The old ones are thrown away.
