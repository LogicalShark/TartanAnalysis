The unbelievable _ has happened! 
The campus War Stamp drive has 
gone over the top! Iris Kwall, chair
man of the Stamp Committee, an
nounced Friday that our goal of 
$3,430 has been more than met. The 
ambulance which the committee 
doubtfully hoped might be purchas
ed by the end of the semester was 
paid for in the first few weeks 
of the campaign. The drive has 
elicited the best response of any 
stamp drive attempted at Carnegie 
since the beginning of the war.
The Carnegie favorite girl contest, 
the big ambulances gradually light
ing up the Canteen and MMCC with 
their red sides, and the Bond Queen 
contest have served their purpose 
nobly. Instead of the $3,430 which 
originally seemed an unattainable 
goal, the committee has collected 
$6,346, $2,916 over the goal.
The campus should -not be too 
proud of its showing, for $4,875 came 
from people off the campus who
CIT Coeds Selling Bonds 
For Bond Queen Contest
Judging from the war Bond re
ceipts already turned in for the 
Bond Queen contest our coeds are 
in there pitching. The competition, 
in which there are only five contest
ants is still open to any and every 
girl on campus. The only qualifica
tion necessary is a bit of salesman
ship; all that the contestant has to 
do is sell War Bonds; and the one 
whose sales add up to the highest 
sum will be crowned Bond Queen 
of Carnegie Tech. To date Jean Gar
land is leading by a few lengths 
with a grand total of $2,268.75. Close 
behind her with $1,500 worth of 
sales is Adeline Herlick. In the backfield but not to be discounted are 
Ann Sweeney with $150. Dorothy 
Caplan with $75, and Ann Shively 
with $18.75. The contest isnt over 
yet for it will continue throughout 
the semester. There is still a chance 
and anyone can win.
have $1,470 worth of stamps to date, 
however, and the committee feels 
that they are to be commended for 
their showing.
The War Stamp Committee re
ports that we now need only $514 to 
buy a second ambulance and that we 
may be able to buy three ambu
lances by the end of the semester 
if the bonds and stamps continue to 
roll in at the present rate. The com
mittee wishes to stress the fact that 
our good luck in meeting our quota 
so early in the semester is no rea
son for buying fewer stamps. Those 
students who signed stamp pledges 
should remember that they have 
promised to buy a stamp a week un
til the end of the semester and that 
their stamps will do just as much 
good on ambulances numbers II and 
III as they did on ambulance num
ber I.'
Mellon Hall Sponsors 
Dance for Engineers
Bringing together many of the 
dorm girls and engineers of Car
negie, Mellon Hall was host to the 
party held at that dorm Friday
night.
For entertainment, the dining 
room was easily converted to a 
dance floor. Other forms of enter
tainment included the usual bridge 
games and shooting the breeze. The 
food was plentiful and delicious. 
Constantly refilled bowls of pretzels, 
potatoe chips, and chocolates plus 
the intermission refreshments of 
hot dogs and Pepsi Cola, kept every
one in a pleasant state of indiges
tion.
Credit for the success of the affair 
goes to Dotty Caplan, Dorm Presi
dent, Imogene Grove, and Toni 
Schlernitzauer, and the rest of the 
dorm girls.
T.E.P. Affair Is 
Success of Year
Saturday night in Thistle Hall 
there was seen the most successful 
dance of the present school year. 
With Bill LeRoys orchestra playing. 
Carnegie students turned out in 
large numbers to make it a really 
big all-school dance.
Beginning at 8:30, couples danced 
to the smooth rhythm of Bill Le
Roys well known orchestra. With 
a wide variety of numbers, popu
lar and otherwise, fast and slow, the 
evening passed swiftly for all.
Intermission time proved to have 
a hilarious surprise performance in 
an Easter Parade. Along the tables 
lining the walls were crepe paper, 
flowers, and other raw materials 
from which were to be fashioned 
Easter Bonnets. Each girl made one 
for her escort, using as much orig
inality as desired. The contestants 
then paraded before the judges. 
After much consideration, five were 
selected and the winner, Floyd Al
lison, was chosen by applause. The 
prizea big, beautiful stuffed rab
bit, plus a very large spring bonnet. 
It seems that the original prize, a 
live bunny, had died the day before 
from indigestion.
Thistle Hall was decorated in the 
gayest of Easter colors, with colored 
eggs covering the walls. The Black 
Cat was open to serve refreshments 
and give relaxation during the even
ing, and was quite popular.
Much work went into making of 
this dance a success. The whole 
school cooperated with the Tecvets 
to make this the first of what is hop
ed to be a series of annual dances.
Delts, Rex Clash For 
Championship Again
Last Wednesday evenings big 
game was everything expected of it. 
It turned out that the Delts and the 
Rex put up a close, fast battle, a 
thriller from beginning to end. The 
game opened with the Rex racehorsing into the lead, and building 
it up at the half to 17-8 over the 
Delts. This first half was all the 
Rexs way, but the second was just 
the opposite. The Delts controlled 
the ball from the opening minute, 
and dumbfounded the speedy Rex. 
The Rex scored only one point in the 
last quarter, and a last-gasp Delt 
fielder gave them the game 25-24!
A shadow, however, was cast over 
the glory of this victory when the 
intramural board ruled Friday that 
the Delts had used an ineligible man 
in an earlier game, that with the 
Betas, and were forced to forfeit it. 
This should lead to a playoff game 
between the Delts and Rex on the 
big floor TOMORROW NIGHT! 
This will undoubtedly be the battle 
of the year, since a performance 
similar to last weeks might be ex
pected.
The TXs were busy last Wednes
day, too, as they stopped the DUs 
by 31-19. Mazur and Barnhart acContinued on page 3

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 27, 1945
C&itosd. AnsHcJiaiA,
Tecvets Show Their Stuff
The extremely successful dance sponsored by the Tecvets on Satur
day night seemed to prove something or other. It could have been that 
Spring Is Here, or that an orchestra rather than a juke-box supplied the 
music, or that we havent had a big dance in a long time. But we should 
like to attribute the success to another reason.
The Tecvets went all out to stage an affair not comparable to any
thing attempted this year by any other organization. They spent a lot of 
money, engaged a big local band, thought up some delightful feature 
ideas, and put a lot of work into making the affair an impressive one. And 
impressive it was, considering that an organization only six months old 
could try and achieve something greater than any plan by an old establish
ed group.
For a comparative baby, the Tecvet club is a pretty strong one. It is 
quite promising as a large and influential group of the future. It proved 
as much Saturday night.
New Horizon
On Friday, March 16, President Doherty reconstituted his Student 
Conference Committee. This committee is made up of the chairman of the 
Activities Council, editor of the Tartan, eidtor of the Technical, chairman 
of Womens Dorm Council, chairman of the Council of Fraternity Presi
dents, chairman of Pan-Hellenic Council, president of Interhonorary Coun
cil, president of Tau Beta Pi, chairman of the Evening Student Council 
and four members at large.
The purpose of the organization is to serve as an active link between 
the student body and the administration through the president. Con
sidering the members of the committee, it seems to promise some ef
ficient work, for who but the leaders of the leading organizations could 
better know the heartbeat of the students? These people are responsible 
for letting the president know of any dissatisfying factors in student lif 
on the campus, with the hope that certain arrangements for the better 
may be made. *
Depending on the administration for aleviating any difficulties is not, 
however, the whole answer to better conditions. Much depends on the stu
dent themselves. In order to have effective student-administration rela
tionships, the students must do their part of cooperation. Amiability is a 
two-way proposition. * t
Look to the Future
Elections are over and the best men won. So we think. Each of the per
sons elected (see list on page 4) is exceptionally qualified to make the Ac
tivities Council of next year an extremely efficient and effective organ
ization. Each is active in several campus groups and well-enough acquaint
ed with conditions as they are to promote better Council function next year. 
Each member is himself a responsible and dependable person. Each is truly 
a representative of the students.
Of significance is the fact that the election last Tuesday was one of the 
cleanest ever held here. There was no stuffing of ballots nor polling place 
electioneering. Also contributing to the fairness, was the method used in 
the casting and counting of ballots, which, as we have explained before, 
was preferential and proportional representation with transferable votes. 
The elected, obviously, were done so by the most efficient election system.
We put our trust in them. We sincerely feel that they are the right peo
ple for the job. We wish them luck and promise our faithful support.
One of the Girls
Opirions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
taff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
o be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.
I lio Carnegie Tartan
Pretty, natural, effervescent, 
friendly are adjectives readily ap
plicable to the girl of the week, Mrs. 
Jane Frederickson. Jane, a fifth year 
student of Nurses Training at Mar
garet Morrison, is one of our student
wives. Her time is divided between 
school, hospital, and husband. At 
school she has received many hon
ors and is absorbed with many ac
tivities among which are Cwens, 
Mortar Board, Delta Delta Delta, 
Margaret Morrison Senate, W. A. A., 
and 1945 Thistle Queen. She is treas
urer of Mortar Board and Recorder 
and Publicity Chairman of her so
rority.
However a great deal of Janes 
time is spent on the wards at the 
hospital where she is in training. 
Needless to say, she likt's nursing, 
particularly the rich fielci of person
al contacts which her profession af
fords her for a hospital is an intro
duction to the hearts and minds of 
all sorts. For anyone like Jane who 
enjoys people and likes to be with 
them nursing is full of fun and 
pleasure. .
Naturally Mrs. Frederickson has a 
bag full of good tales about patients, 
cases, and unusual experiences. One 
of these tales concerns an ailing 
youngster called Alfred who was 
somewhat of a problem child. It so 
happened that one day Alfred disap
peared and Jane with her colleagues 
spent an afternoon in a hectic but 
futile search. Finally they returned
, . Jane Musser Frederickson
to the starting point, the childs bed; 
and there hidden under blankets, 
sheets, and the MATTRESS was 
dear little Alfred. Such is a nurses 
life. One of Janes biggest thrills 
and surprises came last summer 
when she was working as a Public 
Health Nurse in Hazelwood . . . 
She delivered TWINS. After her 
graduation in April when she will 
receive her B. S. and R. N., Mrs. 
Frederickson hopes to teach in a 
hospital or supervise in a clinic.
Besides her college life and hos
pital life, Jane has (and arent we 
envious) her married life. She and 
Rick, her husband, an electrical en
gineer at Westinghouse (non-Techite), have been happily settled in a 
cozy little apartment since Septem
ber 2. Its a wonderful life I under
stand. They listen to Bing Crosby 
records, jitterbug, and play golf to
gether. Mr. Frederickson even ad
mits that Jane is a pretty good golf
er for a girl, which can be interpret
ed to the effect that Mrs. Frederick
son is quite a good golfer. Another 
of the Fredericksons hobbies is col
lecting old United States coins. They 
have pennies older than Indian 
heads and a special breed of dimes 
called D and S dimes. But the 
sport of the season is going to be 
victory gardening. Already the 
Frederickson mail is stacked high 
with seed catalogues, fertilizing ads, 
and pamphlets on the art of tomato 
raising. Shiney new garden tools 
are awaiting the first warm spring 
day and by fall our heroes are ex
pecting a sensational crop of let
tuce, beans, brocoli, cabbage, squash, 
tomatoes, and gladiolas. Yes, gladiolas. That is Janes idea and she in
tends to stick to it. The womans 
touch you know.
However one small item darkens 
the otherwise happy bliss of the 
Frederickson household. It is the 
draft. (Oh sure, Rick has a defer
ment). It is Jane who tremblingly 
awaits those solicitous greetings 
from the President of the United 
States. In her mind she has ready 
visualized herself drafted, in uni
form, and off to the wars while poor 
little hubby stands all alone on the 
platform waving goodbyewith his 
deferment papers.

Those who have night classes on

desired rest for there will be no

Banquet Ticket Report
All persons who have been given 
tickets to sell for the Engineers 
Thirtieth Annual Banquet are re
quested to meet in Room 232 (Pat
tern Shop), second floor of Indus
tries Hall, Tuesday, March 27, at 
10:00 p. m.
The purpose of this meeting is to 
determine the number of tickets 
sold. So be present if possible and 
bring this information with you. If 
you can not attend, send the infor
mation to Joe Rymar, PLAID Edi
tor, Box 362.
Tech Honesty Blackened
The attention of the Plaid has 
been called to an incident which 
happened at the recent swimming 
party held in the Pool.
It is the usual practice to provide 
lockers where clothing can be plac
ed while the students are in the 
pool. These lockers are presumed to 
be policed, but on the occasion men
tioned above one of these lockers 
was entered and the contents of the 
particular locker was ransacked 
and a wallet containing a large sum 
of money together with all the 
identification cards, etc., disappear
ed.
Such an occurrence is of deep con
cern to all of the students as it does 
give room for reflection on how safe 
ones valuables really are. It is a 
question of honesty and the good 
name of Tech. It would be appreci
ated if any information could be se
cured concerning this incident.
The individual who committed 
this act now has in his possession a
large amount of gasoline coupons. 
Any student knowing of anyone at
tempting to sell these coupons 
should send this information to the 
Carnegie Plaid.

The little island of Saipan today has communications

Without this vast array of telephone, teletype and 
radio apparatusmuch of it made by Western Electric 
Saipan could not play its key part as an army, navy and 
air base in the great drive our fighting forces are making 
toward Tokyo.
When you realize that Saipan is only one small island 
and that many more bases must be taken and similarly 
developedyou get some idea of the job still ahead.
Today the manpower and manufacturing facilities of 
Western Electric are devoted to meeting our fighters
