Elsewhere on this page is printed an appeal from a group oi! 
students at Tech to the student body. That appeal urges the 
students to contribute two thousand dollars to make up our share 
of the one hundred thousand dollars being raised by the World 
Student Service Fund for rehabilitation work in China aud 
Europe.
Lest some students feel that this relief campaign will in 
some way aid Germany, let this be said: The money for China 
is to be used to feed, house, clothe and to provide books; in Eu
ropean cases the money will be used to provide books, games and 
other articles which will tend to enable students to continue their 
studies and to prevent demoralization.
Too many of us might be inclined to take this appeal lightly. 
AVe are constantly besieged by various sorts of relief campaigns. 
"With much of the world going through almost indescribable suf
fering, this situation is not unusual. But the many appeals for 
relief have left us with a rather blase attitude.
The money to be raised will be used -exclusively for aiding 
students in China, in German prison camps and in French refugee 
camps. We cannot understand the plight of these students if we 
simply compare them with those among us who work part-time, 
have N. Y. A. jobs or go to night school. Their sacrifice is much 
greater. The Chinese students, for example, have continued their 
education with dogged determination through bomb raids, starva
tion, pestilence and extremes of weather. They have moved from 
"bombed school buildings into shacks and caves, often traveling 
thousands of miles to do so. Many of these journeys were made

Debates Proposal 
For Revising 
Class Honoraries
In an effort to improve the hon
oraries and make them more truly honorary, Council is now con
sidering revision of the constitu
tions of Scimitar, Delta Skulls, 
and Dragons.
First of the proposed revised 
constitutions, that of Delta Skull, 
was presented to Council . last 
week. This constitution differs in 
two points from the plan which 
James Sions composed as a model 
for the revisions. The Delta 
Skulls suggested that, instead of 
having the president of the class 
automatically become president of 
his class honorary, as Mr. Sions 
suggested, the president of the 
Delta Skulls be elected by the 
members. They also provided for a 
three-fourths approval of the 
membership .on prospective mem
bers. In Mr. Sions plan, no vote 
was to be made by the members, 
prospective members being chosen 
purely upon the number of activ
ities and scholarship points they 
had in their favor.
The revised constitutions of the 
other two honoraries are to be
 read a Council meeting tonight at 
7:00, at which time Council will 
vote upon the constitution of the 
Delta Skulls. Some final decision 
upon the honorary question must 
be made soon, if the change is to 
go into effect before members are 
chosen for next year.

Dorsey Elected; 
New Regulations 
To Govern Plebes
Lillian Dorsey, Drama 41, was 
elected Vice-President of the Arts 
Senate, and will serve in that of
fice for the remainder of the 
school year, it was announced at 
Council last week. This office en
tails not only duties in the Senate 
but also a voting membership on 
Student Council.
At the last meeting, Council al
so voted upon the change in 
freshman regulations which Har
vey Hill, the chairman of . the 
regulations committee had pre
sented to Council several weeks 
ago. The plan, which was approv
ed by Council, provides, as the 
TARTAN reported last week, for 
a more simplified system of orien
tation. For example, the Freshman 
traditions tests will be given at 
an earlier date, so that the process 
of making the freshmen feel as 
if they belong will be an active 
part of their first two months at 
Tech.
One revision in the form of an 
addition was made by Paul Wines. 
Paul suggested that the freshmen 
be asked to sign a pledge of co
operation when they enter in the 
fall. This motion would be merely 
another method of eliminating the 
attitude that freshmen regulations 
are designed for the sole purpose 
of torturing the green plebes.

book. Bob thinks he will be in 
the Army when he graduates so 
has made no plans after gradua
tion.
As editor of Techs engineering 
magazine, Bob plans to run sev
eral pages of pictures showing 
new technical processes and in
ventions in each issue. 1-Ie also 
plans to continue increasing 
the circulation of the publication. 
This year its circulation was the 
largest that it has ever been.
The purpose of the annual ban

Foreign Students
TheWorld Student .Service 
Fund is sponsoring a tri-campus 
drive this week for funds for the 
relief of students in the war-torn 
countries of the world. The serv
ice hopes to relieve the starvation, 
exposure, unsanitary conditions, 
and mental deterioration of the 
students who are now trying to 
continue their studies in caves and 
mud huts of western China and 
the prisoner-of-war and refugee 
camps of Europe. To save, pre
serve, and train the student lead
ership of these countries so that 
it may lead the nations to post
war co-operation is the purpose of 
the Fund. To render this service 
separate campaigns are to be car
ried out at the University of Pitts
burgh, PCW, and Tech this week.
The W. S. S. F. is sponsored 
by the National Intercollegiate 
Christian Council and the Inter
national Student Service, and it is 
carrying on the work this year 
that was previously done by the 
Far Eastern Student Service Fund 
and the European Student Service 
Fund. The W. S. S. F. proposes 
to raise $100,000.00 among the 
students of the colleges of the U. 
S. to help restore the student life 
in China and Europe. Some of the 
co-operating organizations are The 
Interseminary Movement, Nation
al Student Federation, Student 
Volunteer Movement, and Uni
versity Commission of Church 
Boards of Education. The national 
director of the Fund is Claud 
Nelson, and the administrative 
secretary is Bob Bilheimcr.
The funds that are allotted to 
the students of China are sent by 
wire to Shanghai from where they 
are taken to the interior by mes
senger. Mr. Paul Moritz who did 
such work in China, came to 
Pittsburgh a month ago to plant 
the seeds from which the present 
drives started. The distribution 
of money is such that not less than

well as that of the submarine, will 
be shown. The movies will be 
accompanied by comments from 
Lt. Com. J. P. Thew who is the 
U. S. Naval Officer in Command 
of Inspection at the Cleveland di
vision of General Motors.
The technical meeting will be 
sponsored by the American Insti

Foreign Students Appeal for Aid
By Executive Committee 
WSSF of Carnegie Tech
The students of the nations at 
war are suffering tortures never 
before so inflicted upon them. 
Many of them wear a single gar
ment, live on one meal a day, and 
sleep on contaminated ground 
the physical suffering is almost 
beyond our comprehension. But 
this is not all: the destructive hor
ror of war is tearing at the moral 
fibre of the students of China and 
Europe. They are fighting against 
attacks by not only conquering 
armies, hunger, exposure, and dis
ease, but by the mental deterior
ation that comes with monotonus 
and inactive confinement.
In China 40,000 who are en
trusted with the future leadership 
of 400 miUion people have walked
2,000 miles over desert and moun
tain in all kinds of weather in 
order that they might continue 
their studies in the West. There 
they must live in caves and mud 
huts, sometimes 100 to a single 
room, with little food and cloth
ing, and scourged by diseases and 
bombs. Yet they ambitiously 
struggle on. They want to study 
now in the midst of this destruc
tion so they will be ready to serve 
their country after the war.
In Europe our fellow students 
live an animal existence in the 
sickeningly unsanitary prisonerof-war camps, internee camps, and 
refugee concentrations. Stripped 
of national pride by defeat, placed 
in an infuriatingly straight-jack
eted routine, and swept by dis
ease, they can only be stimulated 
to a desire to live for the future 
by a mental rejuvenation. This 
mental shot in the arm can be 
provided by the establishment of 
classes of study in these camps. 
Already a few such study/groups 
exist, but many more are needed, 
and are needed immediately. If 
their spirit is sustained, we may 
hope that their leadership after 
the war will establish a righteous 
peace and insure international co
operation.
Since most of Europe has been 
engulfed in war, the U. S. is the 
only source of help for these stu
dents. Last year and the year be
fore, the students in American 
colleges sent help. This year the 
need is many times greater! It is 
our obligation to meet this need, 
and to help salvage and train the 
students of these nations that they 
may lead their countries in the 
way of international co-operation
after the conflict. The U. S. fail
ed to co-operate with the peace 
effort after the last war, and be
cause of this we are partly re
sponsible for the suffering in other 
lands today. The students of Eur
ope look to us now for help again. 
We cannot fail again and still 
hold up our heads as a righteous, 
benevolent nation.
The Tech committee of the 
World Student Service Fund is 
calling upon the student body to 
take part in the work of recon
structing student life in foreign 
lands by contributing to the fund 
this week. We want every student 
to sacrifice some of his pleasure 
or minor necessities this week so 
that he can help. Dont just give 
make a sacrifice for this cause. 
There is not one of us who will 
die if he gives up something to 
help his fellow students. The Tech 
Committee calls upon you to join 
with them in sacrificing lunches, 
or dates, or movies, or cokes so 
that another may eat a meal a day, 
wear more than a sack, sleep in 
a bed, and continue to study for 
the future.
Executive Board 
Permits Auditing
The past policy of the school 
regarding the auditing of classes 
was recently changed by the Ex
ecutive Board. Auditing refers to 
the voluntary attending of the 
classes in a course for which the 
student is not registered. For
merly students were only allowed 
to attend classes in which they 
held class coupons. Under the 
present system, the auditor is per
mitted to attend the class, but 
may not take part in discussions, 
take examinations, or cause the 
instructor additional work or an
noyance.
In order to audit classes, a stu
dent must bo a graduate or un
dergraduate student paying full 
tuition, and fees in the day school. 
Full-time teaching faculty are 
also granted the above privilege. 
This policy refers only to the day 
courses, and attendance in any 
class is subject to the approval of 
the teacher. No record will be 
kept of such attendance, and no 
credit will be given for it. b
President Doherty 
Gets Appointment 
To Defense Board
Last Thursday an announce
ment was made of the appoint
ment of President Robert E. Do
herty to a nine-member produc
tion board to assist in the national 
defense program.
The board, which lists among 
its members Harry Hopkins, Pres-. 
ident Roosevelts personal emis
sary to Britain, will advise on fu
ture steps in the defense pro
gram and the post emergency re
adjustment.
This new defense work of Pres
ident Doherty is expected to re
quire his full time for a month or 
six weeks and part time for, an 
indefinite period following that. 
During his absence, the affairs of 
Carnegie Tech will be administer
ed by a committee appointed by 
the Executive Committee of the 
Trustees. This group is composed 
of Dr. Charles Watkins, Director 
of Margaret Morrison; Dr. 
Webster Jones, Director of Col
lege of Engineering; and Mr. H. R. 
Patton, Comptroller.
The appointment of President 
Doherty was made by. John D. 
Bigger, of the office of Production 
Management, with the approval of 
William S. Knudsen and Sidney 
Hillman.
The newly-formed board will 
review the defense and rearma
ment drive of the last eight 
months, study the last World War 
production experience and make 
recommendations to the planning 
of the present and future produc
tion both for military and civil
ian programs.
Samuel Richard Fuller, presi
dent of the North American Bemberg Corp. and the North Am
erican Rayon Corp., will serve as 
chairman of the committee. Other 
members of the committee in
clude: Admiral William Harrison 
Standley, retired; James Henry 
Burns, formerly executive officer 
in office of assistant secretary of 
war; George Meany, secretarytreasurer of AFL; James B. Corly, secretary of CIO; John L. 
Pratt, retired executive, vice-pres
ident of General Motors, and Wil
liam E. Levis, chairman of the 
Board of Owens-Illinois Glass 
Company.
Speaker Discusses 
Plight of Refugees
Often called a prophet and a 
seer by audiences throughout the 
world, Dr. T. Z. Koo, widelyknown lecturer, will speak in as
sembly, today at 11:30. Dr. Koo, 
who is travelling secretary for the 
World Student Christian Federa
tion, has just returned from the 
Far East where he observed the 
war-conditions in special relation 
to students problems.
Dr. Koos position is a peculiar 
one: he is a native of a country 
which is an ancient cradle of civ
ilization and culture, a country 
to which missionaries have flocked 
in an effort to convert its hea
thens while, at the same time, 
white traders were exploiting the 
wealth of its undeveloped re
sources. Dr. Koo is one of these 
heathens by birth, but has 
adopted Christianity and has 
worked with the organizations 
which have attempted to prevent 
exploitation. One peculiarity of 
his position is that before he 
became affiliated with the Young 
Mens Christian Association, he 
was a railway executive, not 
one of the masses of China to 
whom the missionaries appealed.
But we cannot classify Dr. Koo 
as Chinese or as a member of 
any class or group. He is an in
ternational citizen, having work
ed In the past with the League of 
Nations, and having spoken on 
every continent of the world to 
students who feel as II! they have 
a bond with student In all. the 
other countries of the world. Ho 
has fostered this feeling of a bond 
by his fervor and his firm belief In 
a living, working Christianity. Ho 
also has seen how class differenc
es, in his native China, have 
dwindled as a result of Increased 
cooperation, and has found that 
the talk of a brotherhood of man 
is not the myth or fable wo some
times feel it to be, when viewing 
the International situation.
The assembly is open to every
one, and lt is to everyone that Dr. 
Koo's message will be addressed. 
Recognized as a foremost leader 
in church, education, and state, 
Dr. Koo will certainly bo of vital 
interest to the entire campus.

As a relief from frequent seri
ous plays, the Drama Department 
is producing The Beggars Op
era. This was originally writ
ten by John Gay as a satire on 
Italian opera of the eighteenth 
century. It is a clever play with 
a free, witty style and was the 
greatest and most popular comedy 
of its time. It is being done, here 
at Tech, in a gay, melodramtic 
manner. The singing and dancing 
are in Schubert musical style. The 
lyrics are clever and the scenes 
are done in the two-dimensional to 
give a gay and colorful musical 
comedy effect.
Mr. Lehman Engel, a distin
guished young composer and con
ductor, has come from New York 
as guest director of this produc
tion. During the last five years, 
he has been affiliated with some 
fifty Broadway productions of all 
kinds. He has participated on ra
dio, theatre, and concert stage. At 
the moment, he is running back 
and forth from Pittsburgh to New 
York in order to keep up with all 
his business. Besides his clever 
direction of the music and acting 
in The Beggars Opera, he is

on foot with no other means oJ: carrying belongings than the 
shoulders at' the students themselves. They have endured bitter 
cold in clothing which we would consider inadequate even for a 
temperate climate. They have endured bad housing and sanita
tion conditions such as are not found even in our worst; slums.
Why are they going through this hardship? It, is not because 
papa wants to have a son with a social standing that a college 
diploma ott'crs. They have no employment bureaus to find jobs 
for them at the end of four years training. There are no inter
viewers to offer them positions with this or that company. Their 
work is for their fellow countrymen.
Their suffering will not end with graduation for when that 
lime comes, they must go out and do the job they are being 
trained to do, In these students lies the future of an entire 
nation. They are translating the ancient cultural heritage of 
China to meet new conditions. They are the designers and the 
builders of their countrys future. Out of the chaos of this war, 
their job is to erect' a modern, free, enlightened society.
The government of China recognizes the importance of the 
education of these pioneers. The Chinese Government has dis
couraged. them from leaving college to enter the army. It has 
insisted that their education is more important to the future of 
China than any part they might play on the battle fronts.
A somewhat different situation exists on the European con
tinent. There students are subject to the demoralizing influence 
of concentration camp life. Both in unoccupied France and Ger
many these camps tend to turn out the same type of person.........
a bewildered, broken human being fearful of every move lie 
makes, unable to think clearly. Yet these students in concen
tration camps will tomorrow be asked to reconstruct their coun
tries from the ruins which war has left them. The future of gen
erations rests upon their ability to intelligently reconstruct 
society.
Our job is to maintain their faith in human beings, to keep 
alive their desire to learn and improve themselves. In a real 
sense, their attempt to solve Europes problems will determine 
whether we are to have a lasting peace.
What is asked of us is a very small thing. Giving up two . 
thousand dollars would create among us not one-thousandth of 
the suffering it would alleviate among them. Let us give 
willingly.

. Paul Wines has brought before Student Council a workable 
substitute for hazing freshmen. This plan proposes to set up an 
impartial Sponsor Committee to be composed of representatives 
from dormitories, fraternities and the commuters. This Sponsor 
Committee would be in charge of the operation of the program.
I t would select a sufficient number of juniors and seniors to act 
Vol sponsors for the freshmen.
The committee would provide sponsors with the names of 
future freshmen just as soon as the school has the list of incom
ing students. The plan provides that each chosen upperclassman 
would be responsible for four freshmen who plan to register in 
his department. His job would be to correspond with these freshanswer their questions and attempt' to make their initial 
ranee on the Carnegie campus as pleasant as possible.
> addition to this, the plan provides for various meetings 
i.iiuiu^hout the year in the form of smokers, forums, or informal 
lectures, the purpose of which would be to further the freshmans 
interest in the department toward which he has preference and' 
to facilitate his meeting other freshmen and his departmental 
staff' instructors. Tn addition, the sponsors would be asked to 
work in conjunction with faculty mentors in advising freshmen 
as to participation in extra-curricular activity and proper meth
ods of study.
The plan appears to be very well suited to our situation. It 
is the result of a very complete study of how various other col
leges have handled I lie hazing problem. Tt has worked out well 
elsdwhere. It is worth trying here.
Student Council would do well to consider this proposal 
seriously.

Peppy, attractive, and auburn
haired, Sully is one of schools 
most popular young ladies. She 
has brought a lot to Tech, and 
received in turn four of the hap
piest years of her life. She be
lieves that activities should be ful
ly supported, and does her bit as 
vice-president of M. M. Senate 
and the Secretarial Club. She al
so plays a prominent role in Stu
dent. Council, Scottie, and Gam
ma Phi Sigma.
Making fancy salads and devilfood cake (boys please note) is 
one of her favorite pastimes. She 
adores bright red clothes though 
she is unable to wear them, and 
has heaps of jewelry. Sully is an 
adept jitterbug, but she stilL likes 
the classics, such as the Blue Dan
ube waltz. Her main hobby is peo
ple, because she likes to do things 
for them and to see them happy. 
It is easy to see why she dislikes 
unfriendly, ones.
Sully hates to be rushed or hur
ried, and her friends say that she 
is late nine times out of ten. If 
you have had trouble with lines 
that are always busy, it is prob
ably Sully talking * a blue streak 
over the phone. In fact she loves 
to talk anyplace, anywhere. She 
told us that she dislikes corned

better dining places and more 
room in which to breathe. Though 
she doesnt favor a date bureau, 
she thinks that some way should 
be found to make the students be

A year taken from my life? 
no, I dont think so. As a matter 
of fact when I wind up my year 
of army service, Ill be trained for 
a better job in private life; Ill be 
worth more money. Most of us 
think of an army as a collection 
of riflemen and machine-gunners, 
and do not realize that a modern 
army is a cross section of our spe
cialized and mechanized civiliza
tion, and it rates occupational 
skills even higher than they rate 
in civil life. Today the army is 
an army of specialists. The Selec
tive Service is really clothing, 
housing, feeding, and paying one 
to spend a year in the countrys 
greatest trade school where men 
learn by doing, and the doing is 
under the supervision of experts.
The army is scared that it is go
ing to be shorthanded in the skill
ed fields hence, it is painstakingly 
classifying all skills, talents, and 
interests so that specific experi
ences or preferences can be train
ed further along their particular 
lines. Lest you mistake this for 
War Department propaganda, let' 
me remind you that I am a stu
dent at Carnegie and am myself in 
the draft. And from all indica
tions I expect to be called at the 
end of this school year.
So if youre within draft age, 
stop worrying about how the Se
lective Service is going to steal a 
year out of your young life. The 
army has changed quite a bit. 
When the average draftee leaves 
the service today, he will l^e far

Among other valuable things he 
will have a terse reply to that 
thorny question of the prospective

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1941THE CARNEGIE TARTANSbutterscotch Foils Xnzis
By Ruth Brodie
National defense lias slowly been invading our private life. 
The newspapers, of course, keep reminding us of it; so does the 
radio. Ads for cigarettes and vacuum sweepers and lingerie boast 
that THIS product is endorsed by workers in the defense indus
tries of the United States. A friend of ours recently got a lot of 
new clothes because her father's profession had been given a ter
rific boost by defense orders. (She promptly stole two of-our men 
away from us, but we love her.)
Anyone who reads the TAUT AN knows that the school is do
ing a lot of defense work. Just what it is, we couldnt say. There 
are articles, but they are cheerfully inconsequential; they just say 
that 1,93714 people with I. Q.s of 96 are doing defense work in 
the Pittsburgh area, or some such thing. Nothing about the dimen
sions of the new battleship theyre building in the swimming pool, 
or anything like that. The faculty kows whats going on, though. 
People who were just' academic phenomena have been suddenly 
glorified with defense jobs. They have become cogs in the fluid 
drive of United States preparedness. And theyre so becomingly 
secretive about it, too. Nothing is said without the hand up to 
the mouth, in a Hitchcock spy-t-hriller manner.
We went out and bought a slinky black dress the other day, 
and went to wrork. We are now prepared to disclose, to the high
est bidder, all defense secrets that were heretofore taught in 
Freshman Physics I. Then maybe we can afford to go to New 
York at Easter.

The music department, which we have always considered the 
least captious of coeducational departments, has been reprimanded 
for acting like men and women instead of ladies and gentlemen. 
There has been, we are told, too much spooning along with the 
Shumann; too much hugging instead of Haydn. As we look back, 
were-surprised that we didnt, expect that reaction from the mu
sicians long ago. A bull fiddle is a singularly unsatisfactory thing 
to caress.; it is difficult to imagine driving through Sehenley Park 
with a trombone cuddled up beside you.

Some time ago, we wrote a little piece about our old typewrit
er. Since then, we have donated it to the scrap-iron industry, and 
bought a portablea NEW portable. It is a little jewel, and we 
love it (except the back-spacer keeps breaking. Its broken now, 
and we have it propped up with a piece of match cover so it doesnt 
rattle) but the next typewriter we buy, when we are rich and fa
mous, is going to be so heavy that Superman himself cant carry 
it around. Were always getting into difficulties because of the 
portability of our portable.
We have one of those weird schedules that only a fifth-year 
senior can manage; classes at eight-thirty and a seven-hour gap 
before the next one. Its too much trouble to go home between 
them, so we bring our portable down to school to work there. Then, 
when the four-thirty is over, the smog has settled for the night. Its 
cold. The wind blowing across the cut is bitter and strong. And 
were worn out. So we leave the typewriter in school and go home 
to dinner.' Which would all'be very convenient, if it werent that 
we need the typewriter at home that evening.
Its unthinkable to go back down to school and bring the 
thing home. So we either dont do our work, and flunk all our 
courses, thereby making it impossible for us to graduate, after all 
these years; or else we go down to school to wrork.  Now, were 
not the kind that has to go into a trance to write a theme (al
though it might help) but we cant do much in the middle of a 
howling mob of people. The only solution seems to be to buy an
other typewriter or to quit school. Were letting the whole thing 
hang in the air until June, when it willbe too late.

According, to Admiral Yarnell, 
who spoke to a greater-than-capacity audience at Carnegie last 
Wednesday, the U. S. Navy plans - 
to add technically-trained men to 
its shore engineering staffs, these 
men being given commissions as 
ensigns in the Naval Reserve. Of 
all the junior and senior appli
cants who qualify by passing a 
physical examination, 20 per cent 
will be chosen. There is to be no 
restrictive limit on the graduate 
applicants.
Seniors who are chosen will re
ceive their commissions upon 
graduation in June. Juniors who 
are chosen will be awarded pro
visional commissions and full 
commissions when they graduate. 
It was emphasized that no student 
is in any way obligated to the 
Navy until he signs his full com
mission and takes the oath of al
legiance. Starting pay for en
signs is $183 month. This includes 
a salary of $125 and $58 for sub
sistence.
Those chosen will be exempt 
from the draft. It was also point
ed out that active duty will last 
until the national emergency is 
past, which period may be from 
three to five years. There is a 
slight chance of a reserve officer 
obtaining a position in the Navy 
proper, but the number who will 
be able to do so is very small, 
was the remark of Commander 
Hungerford, who accompanied the

Although modern warfare is a 
horrible pictui'o of mass death and 
destruction, it is often momen
tarily brightened by the humor 
and romantic adventure involved 
in the exploits of some relatively 
unknown individual. Such is the 
story-book-tale of John Flahault. 
A little over a year ago John was 
a Senior Metallurgical student 
here at Tech. Although he was 
not a French citizen, he is of 
French descent and so decided to 
do his part in stopping the ram
paging Germans. He left for 
France in December 1939, and 
there was assigned as a liaison 
agent to an infantry machine gun 
unit in training in Britainy.
When the Germans came 
through, John saw little actual
admiral.
According to C. E. Wangeman, 
of the Bureau of Industrial Re
lations, 150 men, including jun
iors, seniors, and graduates, have 
expressed a desire to receive 
Navy applications. Of these, it is 
estimated that 100 will be chosen. 
Twenty per cent of the senior 
class amounts to 47 men and of 
the junior class, 52. The examin
ing board which will conduct the 
physical examinations is expect
ed to be at Carnegie sometime in 
March. Accompanying it, will be 
a Navy personnel officer who will 
interview the applicants and sub
mit the final forms.
Admiral Yarnell explained that 
the present plan for a two-ocean 
navy can not be carried through 
without an increase in the number ; 
of technically-trained men in the 
various shipyards and naval in
dustries.
It is the opinion of the Navy 
men that the United States will 
enter th present war. A strong 
fleet is needed in both oceans to 
take command of the seas when 
this happens. Admiral Yarnell 
stressed the fact that a twoocean navy does not mean one 
navy for the Atlantic and the-<>ther for the Pacific, but a closely In
tegrated naval machine of suffi
cient strength to patrol both 
waters and keep open the sea 
lanes which are the life lines of 
warfare.
combat, because the French were 
so overwhelmed. The French 
would fall back upon a village 
and set up defense positions, then 
the enemy, as it advanced would 
send forth light motor-cycle troops 
to feel-out the resistance. As soon 
as any was encountered .these 
troops would return to their Pan
zer divissionem and bring it up. 
First came the tanks, then the 
armored cars, and then truckload 
after truckload of German in
fantry-there was not a single 
man afoot. These divisions were 
so powerful and efficient that the 
French just stood and gaped dum
bly as they passed.
For the first two days, the Ger
mans disregarded the conquered 
troops, since they had too much 
to take care of ahead. Then John,  
with the rest of his unit, was put 
in a prison camp in France. Since 
this was so well guarded, there 
was no chance of escape, and he 
stayed there until August when 
he was transfered to Eastern 
France to help gather the harvest. 
Here the camp was guarded only 
by sentries, and there was a pe
riod of six hours between meal 
and roll call when the prisoners 
could escape from the camp to
gether, but once out of the camp 
they needed a ride to get to Paris. 
This was very fortuitously fur
nished by an American metallur
gist and former Purdue man. The 
Germans were not allowed to stop 
American cars or citizens, but since 
John and his friend were French, 
the police on all of the main high
ways leading into Paris could ap
prehend them. For this reason 
they were forced to drive through 
back streets, alleys, and even side
walks to get into Paris.
it was necessary for all French
men to have demobilization pa
pers, and here again John was 
fortunate in having a cousin who 
was a registered pharmacist in 
Paris and so did not need his pa
pers. John took his cousins papez's and changed the name to his
assumed nameLanor. He chose 
this name because it had the same 
number of letters as the original, 
and would cover it up. In order to 
prevent any possible German 
checkup on his army record, he 
changed his birthdate to 1922, 
which would make him eighteen, 
and ineligible for the army. If 
John had been stopped and these 
papers found to be altered, he 
would probably have been sent to 
Germany, and there would have 
been no hope for escape. For this 
reason he paid some friends to 
forge an identification card for 
him, and since it bore the stamp 
of a town in unoccupied territory, 
the authorities could not check its 
validity.
John and his friend employed 
a very clever means of getting into 
unoccupied France. They got  
job on a farm which straddled 
the demarcation line, and then if 
they were caught crossing the line 
they could say that they were just 
going to work in another part of 
the farm. Shortly after they 
crossed the Jine they stopped 
at a French womans farm. 
While they were talking to 
her, a fully armed German pa
trol came up. John and his friend 
quaked in their shoes  they 
thought the lady had sold them 
outbut were able to hide in the 
barn. While they were there, 
they heard the Germans saying 
coffee, eggs; coffee, eggs and 
realized that the soldiers were not 
looking for them, but wanted food. 
No longer worried, the two went 
out and talked to the Germans. In 
the course of the conversation they 
mentioned the fact that the farm 
was in free France. Upon hear
ing this it was the Germans turn 
to turn white, and hold up their 
hands. They said that if their 
officers found them there, they 
would be sent to prison, and beg
ged to be shown the way back to 
the occupied territory. Thereupon 
John obligingly sent the soldiers 
back by the way he had come 
Here John and his friend parted, 
the friend rejoining the army since 
he was a regular, and John going 
to meet his mother In Pau.
From there John wanted to re
turn. to America, but in order to 
do so he was required to have 
papers certifying that he had def
inite business here. Without these 
papers the French government 
would not let him leave. Upon 
Johns request, Mr. Collins, Tech's 
Registrar, sent a letter stating that 
John had been a student at Tech, 
had been granted his degree in 
absentia, and that the school would 
gladly accept him for work on his 
Masters degree. With this letter, 
John was allowed to leave France, 
but when he tried to go through 
Spain, the authorities stopped him, 
since, in order to please the Ger
mans. they were not letting any 
demobilized men through. The 
only alternative rout took John to 
Marseille where he took a boat to 
Algeria. From there he went to 
Casablanca, Morocco by rail. Here 
he boarded an empty banana boat 
which took him to Martinique in 
the West Indies, and continued his 
trip to Guadalupe and finally New 
Yory by means of two more ba
nana boats.

Local Engineering 
Schools Engaged In 
Training Technicians
A report of the Engineering De
fense Training Program under 
the U. S. office of education as of 
February 1, 1941, sets the total 
enrollment of region II at 15,139 
students. Region II includes all of 
Pennsylvania except the south
eastern corner and all of West 
Virginia. Mr. John D. Beatty is 
adviser for this region.
Through the active cooperation 
of the engineering schools, indus
try, and the public and private 
agencies, students have been en
rolled in 30 courses with classes in 
57 different cities and towns. This 
defense program was started in 
October, 1940.
Proposals Are Submitted
On the basis of studies made 
late in 1940 of the potential needs 
for trained men, and on the capa
cities of the schools to take on 
additional students, the six engin
eering schools in the region sub
mitted to the United States Office 
of Education proposals to teach 
engineering defense courses.
A few of the defense courses 
given at Carnegie Tech are as fol
lows: Testing and Inspection, Pro
duction Engineering, Production 
Supervision, Machine Design, Ele
ments of Metallurgical, and Phys
ical Engineering, and Engineering 
Drafting. This is typical of the 
courses being taught at the other 
schools.
The proposals submitted to Feb
ruary 1, 1941, list 30 different 
courses totalling 18,227 students. 
It is expected that the final enroll
ment figures will approximate 
this total.
The estimated cost of these 
courses, which in general will 
run 24 weeks of eight or nine 
hours a week, is $1,414,247. Cong
ress appropriated a total of $9,- 
000,000 for the program through
out the country.
The intensive Interest of stu
dents and faculty members, as 
well as the interest of the admin
istrators of the program, encour
ages the; belief that the acute need 
for technically trained personnel 
which is anticipated later in the 
year will be' alleviated lo a con
siderable extent by the training 
being given under the Engineer
ing Defense Training Program.
Happy Day
Class Sitting-Ill
Is Now Permitted
By Gilbert Klvonson
It has been announced by the 
executive board that auditing is 
now possible, which means that 
any enrolled day student can now 
sit in on classes for which he is 
not registered. He cannot inter
rupt the professor, ask Him ques
tions, or annoy him in any man
ner, but, considering the number 
of recumbent listeners at required 
lectures who do not ask the pro
fessor any questions at all, this 
should not be a serious setback.
It will now be possible for en
gineers to take Fine Arts courses 
and for Maggie Murphs to study 
calculus, all without homework 
and, of course, without credit. 
This represents a college educa
tion at its best. No trouble, no 
bother, no fuss. Just sit in on 
what interests you, drop it at mid
semester if you like, or take it 
for credit the following semester 
and receive an A!
No longer will the socialization 
of engineex-ing curricula be a prob
lem. No longer will home eco
nomics students be forced to wait 
for the man of the house to fix 
the ironing cord. Chemical engi
neers will win prizes in the Asso
ciated Artists contests, and dramats will design bridges. Oh 
happy day!

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1941
Tech Braintrusters
Thirteen Carnegie brainstorms 
came through with four point fac
tors on the Institute Honor List, 
which has just been released from 
the office of Mr. E. K. Collins, 
Registrar.
Among the thirteen with per
fect records were five sophomores 
and five freshmen. The others 
were seniors, as the junior class 
failed for the second straight time 
to produce a four point scholar.
Last semesters honor roll com
pared closely with the previous se
mesters. There were 248 names, 
.five less than the preceding time. 
The sophomore class, freshmen 
last year, made another spurt and 
now has 84 of its members on the 
list.
The honor list for last semester 
follows. Figures in parentheses 
after names indicate the number 
of times the student has been cited 
previously for honors.

Unanimous Vote 
Given to Painting 
By Abe Weiner
By Charles E. Spry
Abe Weiner is an artist because 
painting is the most important 
thing in the world to him, and be
cause the very first piece of work 
he submitted to the Associated 
Artists of Pittsburgh has won first 
prize.
Critics, artists, and the public 
are united in agreeing that Back 
of Isalys is one of the most out
standing pieces of work in the 
current exhibition at Carnegie In
stitute.
But Abe goes on unchanged. He 
appeared on opening night, it is 
true, wearing a sort of luminous 
cloud, part amazement, part ex
citement; but otherwise he was 
quite as usual; dressed in lumber
jack, cap, open collar with no tie. 
And any number of people with 
no prizes to boast of were there 
complete in soup-and-fish.
Abe would be a senior in the 
Department of Painting and De
sign, but he was unable to come 
back ' full time this year. He 
doesnt mind too much being part 
time, for he doesnt like classifica
tions (grades dont matter to him) 
and all he wants is a chance to be 
free to paint the things he likes 
the way he wants. For, though 
shy and friendly, Abe is also very 
stubborn about the very important 
business of being true to himself.

recognition. The 30th Annual Ex
hibit of the Associated Artists is 
on display in the Carnegie Insti

Dr. Dohertys oil painting, en
titled Beer Party, was award
ed honorable mention by the judg
es. Painted in various shades of 
blue, it shows a group of gleeful 
young men drinking and tapping 
beer from a barrel while in the 
background two other youths, 
shadowy figures under the light 
 of a-full moon, give vent to their 
joviality in exuberant capers.
Another of Dr. Dohertys con
tributions to the exhibit, an at
tractive water-color House and 
Sand Dune, has received the dis
tinction of being purchased by the 
One Hundred Friends of Pitts
burgh Art. Each member of this 
group contributes ten dollars an
nually for the purchase of paint
ings to be presented to the Pitts
burgh Board of Education. and 
placed in the public schools of the 
city.

THISTLEDOWN
STILL LOSING
mw m3CC vCNw., DIN14B l.34N1
Best Game of the Season
Whether it was caused by an honest, desire to win, the inspir
ed words of the coaeli, the appearance of several famous T$ch 
basketball stars of old, or the hope of showing their patron saint 
(Press columnist Eddie Beachler) the}' could play ball if they put 
out for the entire game, the Tartan basketball charges turned in 
their best game of the season last Saturday night.
Pulled and pushed along by the combined efforts of big Henry 
Holets and flashy Randall Burch the scrappy Skibos made the 
slightly corroded Iron Men of old Duquesne fight, for'every point 
Big Hank stood out like a good thumb on a sore hand in his work 
of rescuing balls falling from the banking board, while jumpy 
Red (despite his bowl-like haircut) kept the opposition constant
ly on the run with his excellent ball handling and brilliant 
shooting.
Its probably a little late in the season to claim a moral vic
tory, but this contest comes closer to being such than any other 
battle waged by the Plaid floormen this season.
Report on Risedorphs Boys
During the past week the Carnegie swimmers trounced the 
Westminster mermen and dropped a contest to the splashers from 
Case School of Applied Science. Both of these water battles were 
closer than the printed score indicate, however in the Westminster 
contest Coach Risedorph brought out his favorite trick of putting - 
the weaker members of the team in several of the events.
To date the Tartans have won three and lost three with a trio 
of meets still on the books. The most important of these remaining 
battles are scheduled to take place this week-end when the squad 
takes to the road to meet the University of Delaware and Temple 
University. This trip will serve as both a climax and a finale to 
the current season, and for this reason Captain Molvie and Coach 
Allan B. will be striving to salt away the proverbial bacon.
Tartan leers Defeated 
By State in Tight Game
and as the period closed the tally 
'was deadlocked at 1-1.
Early in the last canto the State 
forward wall rifled a shot' at 
Techs, Freddie Feller, who stop
ped the shot with his skates, but 
as one of the members of the Nittany offense came ploughing into 
him, the puck barely crossed the 
line to put the Penn State men 
ahead, 2-1.
To make matters tougher for the 
Tartans, this tally was followed 
in short order by a one-man scor
ing thrust by States man, Fow
ler, who skated around Bob 
Church and outguessed Feiler to 
whip the puck into the Skibo goal 
and run the count up to 3-1.
The never-say-die Tartans 
fought hard to even the count in 
the waning moments, but the State 
defense tightened and held until 
the final whistle blew.
Negotiations are now under 
way to schedule a game at the 
Gardens with John Carrol, a team 
that has won 3'8 consecutive col
lege ice hockey contests. In all 
this long string, Tech came clos
est to upsetting the Carrol men as 
they droped a narrow 3-2 decision 
to the Ohio team last year.
By George Tondorf
In a fast, hard-fought fracas 
in Johnstown last Friday night the 
Tartan icers dropped a tough 3-1 
decision to the Nittany Lion' of 
Penn State. One of the best as
pects of the game from a Tech 
standpoint was the fine turnout of 
student rooters who backed the 
skillful play of the Skibos with 
loud cheers.
State drew first blood midway in 
the first period, when they scored 
on a neat play climaxing a spir
ited offensive drive. Spurred on 
by the one point deficit, the Tar
tans took matters into their own 
hands and carried the fight to the 
Nittany goal for the remainder of 
the opening chukker.
Sivacliek Scores
Coming back in the second pe
riod even stronger, the Plaid went 
deep into enemy territory and as 
Benny Bergson passed the puck 
across the ice to Evans, Ivan Sivachelc tore in, took a neat assist 
from Evans and shot one past 
the State goalie for a Skibo score.
The remainder of the second 
period saw both teams making re
peated scoring threats to no avail,
w. A. A. NEWS
 By BETTY PARKER -
The board met last week and 
passed on a new organization for 
the sports under W. A. A. so that 
every girl on campus will receive 
the maximum benefit and pleasure 
from this, her own organization. 
Each sport, under its own man
ager, will be organized into a 
club, membership of which will 
require a certain amount of par
ticipation in that sport. The mem
bers of the club will meet at spe
cific times and each member will 
be an integral .part of her own 
club. The number of clubs to 
which a girl may belong is 
* terest keener than that of previous 
sports, watch for notices, and 
come out to join in this program. 
In Basketball the club will con
sist of enough people to make up 
two teams, so that; in all meetings 
there will be enough people for a 
practice game. That same plan 
will be carried out in all the othter 
sports, and each club will work
on the needs and requirements of 
its sport. Each club member will 
be receiving W. A. A. points for 
participation.
And speaking of points brings 
me to another new feature that 
the board discussed and decided 
upon. As you all know now, 
awards are given to those juniors' 
and seniors who have a total of 
30 points for each year they have 
been in Tech. Now, in addition to 
these tempting awai'ds, the W. A. 
A. plans to offer a SOPHOMORE 
award, something new and differ
ent. So that to the girls who have 
30 points for their freshman and 
sophomore years, W. A. A. will 
give an award in the spring at 
the annual awards party. This is 
something for you to work to
ward and under this new system, 
we expect you all to gather your 
friends, join one, two, or three of 
the sport clubs, and in no time 
youll be the proud owners of W. 
A. A. AWARDS!

Techs Aquatic stars churned to 
a decisive victory over West
minster last Monday in a slightly 
one-sided meet. Thet score was 
15 to 30. Tech won all but two 
events, one of which was the -100 
yard relay which counts seven 
points for the winner,
Tech won the 300 yard relay 
in 3 minutes 37.(> seconds. Burtis took first place in the 220 free
style, while I-Iamel of Westminster 
took second. Techs Molvie won. 
in the 50 yard freestyle. Brown 
and Lewis took first and second 
places in the diving event, and 
Molvie took another first in the 
100 yard freestyle. Techs Martin 
and Church took first and second 
in the 150 yard backstroke event. 
Westminster mustered its forces 
to take the 200 yard breast stroke 
and also the 400 yard relay but 
Tech was not to be outdone. Boehm'ig won the 440 yard freestyle in 
6:00 flat.
On Friday evening Tech lost a 
heartbreaker to the Case team. 
The score was 39 to 36, with the 
meet being decided in th final 
event, the 400 yax-d relay. Case 
took only four out of the nine 
firists in the meet, the whole 
meet being decided in the final 
and all-important 400 yard relay.
Tech lost the 300 yard medley 
relay, but Burtis came through 
to win the 220 yard freestyle, and 
Molvie followed him with a vic
tory in the 50 yard freestyle. 
 Tech took both first and second 
in the diving event, and again 
Molvie came' through to win the 
100 freestyle. Case took firsts in 
the rest Of the events except the 
440 yard freestyle, in which 
Boehmig came from behind to win.
The team is short men for the 
400 yard relay event, which is 
often a deciding factor in a meet, 
but all of the boys do their utmost 
at all times in spite of almost 
overwhelming odds. It is only this 
spirit that keeps the team from 
going down in ignominious'defeat 
against teams like Case and Penn 
State.
Freddie Feiler, captain of the hockey squad, has been doing a 
sensational job of tending the strings for the Skibos this year. In this 
years contests, Freddie has proven himself the sparkplug of the ag
gregation.

Intramural bowling is rolling 
along at a fast clip this year. The 
totals have been jjirger and in
terest keener than of previous 
years at the same time. A great 
deal of the smooth running 
and good organization are due to 
the efforts of George Van Nort.
Points are given on the basis of 
games won. That is, there are 
3 games to a match and for each 
game won the team winning it re
ceives one point. Then at the end 
of the season the team in theleaguo 
which receives the greatest num
ber of points' will be acclaimed 
the winner of its league. The win
ner of league A will bowl the 
winner of league B'for the Chool 
championship.
In league A Beta Theta Pi leads 
with an untainted record,. They 
have all 3 points from 3 matches 
for a total of 9 points. Second 
place is held by Delta Tau Delta 
with 8 points. The same standing 
is held by the PiKAs. The Citcom 
Clan holds first place in league B 
with 9 points and there seems to 
be no serious contenders for this 
position aside from the Clan.-
Last Satux-day night at Skibo 
gym, the current Carnegie Tech 
basketball team equalled the 
school losing streak of fifteen 
stx-aight games, although they put 
up a teiTific battle against the 
Duquesne quintet. Pxevious . to 
this, the Pitt varsity administered 
the fourteenth defeat at the stadi
um pavilion on Tuesday night. No 
person who has seen the last two 
games can say that the local boys 
have xiot played their hearts out 
in an effort to win a victoi'y from 
either Pitt or Duquesne. Both 
nights the Tartans were in the 
game to the final second giving 
the opponents a rugged wox'kout. 
but they just couldnt get enough 
points for a victoxy.
In the Pitt game on Tuesday 
night, the final count was only 38- 
29 (accoi-ding to Mx\ Beachler of 
the Press, the Pitt team made 
an effort to keep the score down 
in the final minutes, since they 
were leading by the exceedingly 
large margin of nine points). 
When asked what would be the 
highlight of the game; Max Hannum told the sportswriters that 
Straloski would be held scoreless; 
this prediction was lost somewhere
in the shuffle and received no 
publicity even after Red Burch 
fulfilled the pi-ediction. It seems 
that the only publicity the team 
receives' is as the futility five, 
and winless wondex*s, all such 
publicity being greatly appx-eciated by those interested in the 
progress of the team. Some of the 
boys believe that the cold at the 
pavilion had a lot to do with their 
missing the fn*st seventeen shots 
at the basket. If the atmosphere 
had been warmer they believe that 
they could have made a third of 
these shots (then Pitt would not 
have had the opportunity to lay 
down and play Boy Scout).
At the Duquesne game on Sat
urday night, another familiar fig
ure in addition to Al was present. Rube Stark was back on the 
bench but this time as a specta
tor, with evex'yone hoping that his 
presence would break the jinx. 
The final count was 43-29 with 
Captain Red Burch pacing both 
teams with 12 points and play
ing a very spectacular game, hold
ing Moe Becker to a grand total 
of five points.

Things are plenty hot around 
the campus these days as the In
tramural Basketball league 
rounds the far tux-n and heads 
down the home stxetch. Though 
the past week netted no results 
which would affect the standings 
of the top aggregations, some 
suxprising scores occurred ih the 
competition. In the Independent 
league, the most important game 
held was that between the Plant
ers and McGill Hall. Though 
neither of these teams held top 
positions in the standings the 
game, which was one of pure i*ivalry, was a thriller. The Dorm 
boys ended up on top of a 23 to 
21 score, much to the surprise of
everyone. Other x-esults were as 
follows: The Newmanites lost to 
the AIChEs, the Architects took 
a forfeit from the Soph Engin
eers, the AIChEs defeated the 
Soph Engineex's, Scobell Hall took 
a forfeit from the Architects, and 
the Metallurgists defeated Boss 
Hall.
In the Fraternity league, things' 
are pretty much the same. The 
SAEs are still out in fi*ont, with 
the Kappa Sigs, Tau Delts, and 
the DUs running a close second. 
Results of the past weeks contests 
yielded the Delts a defeat by both 
the Sigma Nus and Kappa Sigs, 
the DUs a win over the Beta Sigs, 
and the Tau Delts a victory, over 
the Phi Kaps.

Welcome
The night students welcome 
Mrs. Patterson to the Carnegie 
Union, the house on the hilltop. 
The day school students have kept 
her to themselves but now we 
have a chance to share her. Mrs. 
Patterson had been living in the 
Graduate Girls House where she 
had been acting as second Moth
er to the girls. Stop in and in
troduce yourself to a new friend 
of the night school.

Regrets Leaving 
Carnegie Campus
Many of you who have come to 
the Tech Campus on exhibition 
night have no doubt always man
aged to see the Exhibition House 
at the lower end of the Indus
tries Hall. Constructed by the day 
school students in the Masonry 
Shop under the supervision of 
Charles W. Larkin, this project, 
always a work of art. comDletely 
furnished and landscaped, received 
many fine compliments. Motion 
pictures have been shown in News 
Weekly and at the Philadelphia 
Sesquicentennial.
Mr. Larkin has now been ap
pointed Shop Supervisor for the 
State of Pennsylvania, with the 
National Youth Administration. 
This work will deal with the use 
of our shops for Defense Work as 
well as the many shops of other 
schools for making materials and 
things necessary for the Navy and 
ether Military organizations.
After having spent 24 years on 
the Tech Campus, Mr. Larkin has 
obtained a leave of absence from 
the school to look after this vital 
and necessary work. The inter
est he will find in his new work 
will tend to make up for the many 
friends and associates he leaves 
behind. The Night School wishes 
him every success._________________

es would be cancelled. If the Un
ion is willing to permit the fra
ternities to hire non-union bands 
for their house parties then it 
should also be willing to make 
the same concession for these 
non-profit making free dances.
Under the present conditions 
there are a total of twelve danc
es on the Evening Social Calen
dar. Four of these are held by 
Student Council; three by Fine 
Arts; three by Industries, and the 
remaining two are sponsored by 
the College of Engineering. 
Council is willing to agree to hire 
Union bands for their dances and 
the College of Industries has 
been hiring Union bands for 
theirs, making a total of seven 
Union bands out of twelve pos
sibilities. Now if Evening Student 
Council is forced to sign a blanket 
contract this is what will happen 
the free dances will, in all 
probability be dropped, and the 
Union would only get four dances 
where they formerly had seven. 
You dont have to go to college to 
see that that is bad figuring on 
their part.
To protect the welfare of its 
students, Evening Student Council 
has found it necessary to take its 
present stand. Some may say its 
unfair, but we fail to think so. 
We feel that the Union is being 
extremely unfair for trying to 
make day school the goat for 
what Evening School has done. 
We are two separate organizations, 
in no way connected, so why 
should one group be held respon
sible for what the other has done? 
The Union should be made to un
derstand this situation, and should 
carry on its dealing with both 
groups. What may be financially 
possible for day school would 
probably be financially impossible 
for the Evening School, and when 
such great differences exist it is 
nearly impossible to find an j 
agreement acceptable to both par-J 
ties.
Evening Student Council isH 
willing; however, to meet with 
day school in the hope that the 
present situation can be remedied. 
They desire no ill feeling between 
the two groups, but believe that 
their first concern must be for the 
good of the students they repre
sent.

According to the editorial which 
appeared in last weeks Tartan, 
many students will be led to be
lieve that the present Union con
troversy at Tech is due to a sel
fish attitude on the part of Even
ing Student Council. That is not, 
and never has been true. The edi
torial also states that Day Student 
Council and Interfraternity Coun
cil have no quarrel with the Un
ion and are ready to sign a con
tract without changing in any way 
the present relations with the 
Union. Nite Student Council, is al
so. ready to sign a contract under 
the same conditions, but it is on 
them that the Union is making the 
demands which the officers think 
are unfair. Perhaps if those de
mands and their resulting influ
ences on the Evening Student 
were explained, our position 
would seem more clear and rea
sonable.
First, the Union demands . a 
blanket agreement which would 
cover all evening school dances. 
This means that it would be neces
sary for all colleges to hire Union 
bands for their free dances. That 
statement in itself makes the sit
uation impossible, for none of the 
individual colleges, with the pos
sible exception of the College of 
Industries, can afford to pay the 
Union price, for a band. There
fore, if the contract were signed 
it would mean that the free dancOn account of numerous com
plaints and broken homes, and 
dirty cracks behind our .back and 
stuff, we are not going to give 
our friends any of our nice public
ity this week but deal only with 
the deserving big things, like the 
Defense Class for instance.
Take Steve Marcinizyn. He 
runs everything, just everything. 
Hes that tall blond that your girl 
is always drooling about at the 
dances. We could go on and on 
about our officers but what would 
that leave for blackmail?
Is your husband, sweetheart, 
brother, or something giving his 
all for the countrys defense on 
Tuesday and Thursday evenings 
to hear him tell it? Well, let me 
tell you girls, that is all just so 
much propaganda. We were there 
last week, (well practically), 
when the Prof murmured some
thing under his breath about steel 
being nice stuff to have around, 
snickering, and then flashed on a 
slide picture of a luscious blonde 
being just too cute in a bathing 
suit. Defense Class, Hah!
Anyway, men are so silly any
way. From our usual unimpeacha
ble source, we have it that biggame - hunter - anyway - a-rabbitmay-bo, Ed Tiepel, went dashing 
around the country side last au
tumn in search of illusive fauna 
and bagged a small tiger, species 
well, sort of like a cat. The crea
ture put up a terrific fight, but 
after Ed hit it squarely broadside 
with his 32 Plymouth or what 
not, the thing just lay down and 
died. Just dont invite us up for 
rabbit stew, thats all we ask.
And among other foolish, but 
awful darn nice tilings, there is 
Jocelyn Pearsall. Badly in need 
of lessons from Madame La Zonga, she La Congoed for a select 
group of hecklers at Stewarts kind 
of exclusive dine and dance jemt 
a few Saturdays back. It was all 
very pretty, but we still feel that 
Eleanor Powell has a slight edge.

Miss Gorsky 
Holds Dual 
School Honors
Industries Elect 
Only Feminine 
Council Member
Miss Eleanor Gorsky has drawn 
the fate of all lone feminine mem
bers of Council, that is as Secre
tary of Council. Eleanor also rep
resents the Evening College of 
Industries on the Evening Student 
Council as secretary of that col
lege. This is her first year as a 
Council officer, but she has been 
very active on the campus for the 
past several years.
Miss Gorsky was born and 
raised in the Pittsburgh area. Her 
elementary schooling was receiv
ed at South High School, where 
she followed the general course of 
studies. Eleanor was also a very 
active member of the South High 
Student Body. She was editor of 
the school paper, a member of 
the Quill and Scroll Club (the 
high school National Honor So
ciety for Journalists), a member 
of the Philo Literary Society, and 
also a member of The National 
Honor Society (a scholastic hon
orary). Eleanor was graduated 
from high school in the fall of 
1033.
Daytime finds Eleanor at the 
Eller Lumber & Mill Company 
where she has been doing general 
office work for the past five years.
Attending Tech since the fall 
of 1938, Eleanor has followed a 
course in Architectural Drafting 
and intends to finish the course 
offered by that department in a 
few years.
In her leisure time, Eleanor 
plays the piano and also takes 
voice lessons. Classical music 
holds her'preference over swing 
music, but Eleanor likes to dance 
to sweet music. Eleanor likes to 
swim, play tennis, and to camp. 
Her greatest desire is to be an ac
tive social worker.
Being very active on the camp
us, Eleanor has received two 
Evening Student Council Activi
ties Insignia Awards for her work 
in the extra-curricular activities 
and will receive another this sum
mer.
Regarding the members of the 
male sex, she says that she is not 
very particular as long as they 
have sense (or maybe cents).
As Scene of Event 
On Saturday, Mar. 1
Next Saturday evening at 9 
oclock, March 1st, the College of 
Engineering will hold its final 
dance of the year in Thistle Hall.
Despite the current squabble 
with the Union, Art Sable and his 
orchestra will play for the dance. 
This is Mr. Sables second appear
ance on the Tech campus this 
year. His music was so well re
ceived at the Nu Sigma Alpha 
dance that the social committee 
felt the students would like to 
have him return.
A great deal of secrecy has sur
rounded the style and the decora
tions. When the Plaid reporter 
approached one of the Engineer
ing officers about the plan, he just 
smiled and said, "Wait and see. 
Conditions being as they are, thats 
about all we can do, but to be sure 
we dont miss anything special TE 
intend to be there when these 
highlv heralded decorations are 
unveiled.
Theres one thing that wont be 
changed, howeverits the Black 
Cat Room. It will still be clouded 
with smoke, and crowded to 
capacity with those who feel that 
they must have something cool 
before they dance another step. 
But who wants to change the 
Black Cat Roomits just like the 
Crystal Ball. The ball is always 
whirling and the room is always 
crowded.
Corsages will be given to the 
first two hundred girls, and ad
mission will be free to all stu
dents from Engineering. All oth
ers will be required to pay an ad
mission fee of $1.00.
Invited are Mr. Shaffer, Mr. McKelway, Mrs. Yon, Mrs. Patter
son, Dr. Moskovitz, Dr. Warden, 
Dr. Doherty, Mr. McKee, Dr. 
Gregg, Dr. Jones, Dr. Trinlcs, Dr. 
Rosenbach, Dr. Guild, Professor 
Prlne and Professor Alemano.

Evening Student Council held 
their annual Washingtons' Birth
day Dance last Saturday evening, 
February 22, In Thistle Hall.
Thistle Hall greeted the danc
ers with a patriotic theme of red, 
white and blue streamers, hat
chets, and cherries cleverly ar
ranged by the workers committee.
Dancing began promptly on the 
down beat at nine and ended with 
the "Goodnight Sweetheart 
waltzes at midnight. Social chair
man, Joe Gummo, was fortunate 
to secure "Buzz Astons smooth 
music for the occasion. Mr. As
tons eleven men and a girl were 
enjoyed by everyone. It was the 
first appearance of this band on 
our evening school campus and 
we are hoping that our social com
mittee will arrange for a return 
engagement in the near future.
Novel programs and gay cor
sages were presented to the first 
200 fair bits of femininity. We 
were pleased to rest our eyes on 
the majority of evening gowns 
the .young ladies worea most 
suitable place for the corsages.
The members of the faculty 
present, who were invited to 
chaperon the dance were Mr. and 
Mrs. II. L. McKee, Mr. and Mrs. 
Beryl E. Warden, Mr. and Mrs. 
Kent Shaffer, Professor and Mrs. 
Willbold Trinlcs, President and 
vMrs, Robert E. Doherty, and Mr.
