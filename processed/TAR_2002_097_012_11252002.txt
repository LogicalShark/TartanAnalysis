CMU lawyer lectures about cyberlaw and 
discusses her role at the University
by Andrew Conklin
Staffwriter
Imagine if tomorrow a court 
overturned the Windows [soft
ware] license, and said it was not 
enforceable. Wed all love that, but 
Microsoft would collapse, and 
most of the information companies 
would collapse, said Mary Jo 
Dively, Carnegie Mellons general 
counsel since September 2002. 
Dively emphasized the importance 
of codifying software license regu
lation policies to attendees of last 
Wednesdays, seminar on the 
Uniform Computer Information 
Transactions Act, (UCITA), held in 
Wean Hall.
She explained that the Act, 
already enacted in Maryland and 
Virginia, provides substantive con
tracting measures dealing with 
electronic information transac
tions. It does not apply to transac
tions that are already regulated, or 
minimally electronic. Essentially, 
this Act is an effort by the legal
community to see that information 
companies can draw up contracts 
that offer them sufficient legal pro
tection, and also to make sure that 
consumers are not victimized by 
end user contracts, which are the 
terms a software buyer agrees to 
upon installation.
After the seminar, Dively spoke 
with The Tartan about her role at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Prior to her position as general 
counsel, Dively practiced law in 
the private sector for twenty years. 
She worked for the law firm Reed 
Smith where she specialized in 
electronic information and com
merce law.
I met with the [CMU] search 
committee and was really quite 
intrigued with the potential for the 
position, said Dively. I had not 
thought about leaving private 
practice before, but this opportuni
ty looked to me like a perfect mar
riage: the things that I am interest
ed in and good at, and the ability to

Senate Chair says member 
shortage is a big problem
by Tim Bowen
Staffwriter
Last Thursday, 18 student senators 
voted on the controversial Freedom 
of Information policy that will allow 
open access to the line item budgets 
of student organizations. The bill 
passed with 10 in favor, six against, 
and two abstentions. With 10 sena
tors absent from the meeting and 
eight senate seats still unfilled, only 
half of the 36-seat Senate chimed in 
on the hotly debated bill. Vacancies 
are due in large part to unsuccessful 
fall elections that yielded Optimus 
Prime for the CFA seat with two 
votes.
I do think thats [attendance is] a 
problem, I think its a big problem, 
said Senate chair and junior philoso-. 
phy major Paul Richelmi.
Quentin Steenhuis, junior logic 
and computation major and chair of 
the internal development committee, 
is also concerned about the number 
of unfilled Senate seats.
Whats unfortunate is that people 
arent drawn to Senate, he said. 
There are a number of students who 
do not know there is a Senate, which 
is really disappointing.
One vacant seat that was filled in 
fall elections was that of Mike 
Sebetich, a senior information sys
tems student and former chair of the 
funding and recognition committee. 
Sebetich, who was the student body 
treasurer last year, cited poor leader
ship and an inactive Senate as his rea
sons for resigning and as the reasons 
for other students lack of interest.
I probably would have stayed on if 
I felt that Senate was working on 
worthwhile issues. Sebetich believes 
that the Senate should be addressing 
problems which directly affect stu
dents, such as dining.
Senate should take control of 
[dining], but Senate has failed to do 
so, he said.
Steenhuis also voices dissatisfac
tion with the issues being discussed 
on the Senate floor. I am disappoint
ed that we have not taken up more 
sustentative issues, he said, adding 
that he has decided to take next 
semester off from Senate. Steenhuis 
has been mentioned by several stu
dent government officials to be con
sidering a run for student body presi
dent next year. He declined to com
ment. Richelmi blames his own bout

CMU will not face the sharp budget cuts next year like wealthier peer institutions
by Nick Ennis
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon will raise tuition 
for the 2003-04 academic year, in 
part to cover a $9 million projected 
budget shortfall for the next fiscal 
year.
The University will announce a 
tuition rate hike of between five and 
10 percent in January after each 
department meets with Provost Mark 
Kamlet to determine their budgets. 
But the shortfall isnt the dire straits 
that some top-ranked universities 
find themselves in today.
According to William Laird, acting 
chief financial officer, this year is not 
very different from any other year for 
Carnegie Mellon.
The good news is that there is no 
crisis here. But [the University] is still 
careful of how it spends money. I am 
worried more about the two years 
after 03-04, said Laird.
Even with a 5 percent increase in 
tuition, the university will still be 
nine million dollars short of meeting 
its estimated expenses.
The situation last year was a little 
harder, partly because we plan for a 
higher increase in tuition next year. 
To reconcile the budget, we work on 
both the revenue and expenditure 
sides to fill the gap. To make cuts, we 
look for areas that are not getting 
bang for the buck, said Kamlet.
The Provost will go on a retreat 
with department heads and financial 
administrators next month to discuss 
their budgets and cut costs. Whatever
is left of the shortfall after the retreat 
will determine the exact amount of 
the tuition increase.
The budget analysis occurs annual
ly at Carnegie Mellon. The University 
discontinued operations at the 
Carnegie Mellon Research Institute 
in 2001.
The Center for Innovative 
Learning, a program to enhance 
undergraduate education through 
research, was also cut.
The Provost said he does not 
expect any significant cuts this year, 
just vigilance in spending by each 
department.
However, Carnegie Mellon will 
spend 8 to 13 percent more on finan
cial aid next year, part of which will 
be used explicitly for increasing stu
dent diversity.
According to Laird a new fundrais
ing compaign plan is in the works to 
strengthen the endowment. 
Additionally, he said that there are 
many things the university would like 
to do  add housing space, maintain 
buildings, and improve dining  that 
do not immediately bring in revenue 
to pay for themselves. These projects 
are difficult to work into a tight bud
get.
But spending is only one side of the 
equation.
While tuition accounts for much of 
the Universitys revenue, Carnegie 
Mellon currently receives $223 mil
lion of its $550 million budget from 
research contracts.
Research that is carried out on 
campus helps the University pay 
faculty salaries and other overhead

Cops nab 
CatMan 
burglars
by Andrew Johnson
News Editor
They came through the vent in the 
door to steal strange things: a tooth
brush, a laptop, and some CDs. Two 
burglars slipped into Cathedral 
Mansions on Wednesday the 13th, 
probably trailing a resident as they 
entered. Residents said the vent 
grates on their doors jiggled loosely. 
Residents who lost their keys said 
they could easily slip into their rooms 
by applying a credit card or an 
unrolled plastic soda bottle to the 
lock.
Detective John Mihalcin, a fouryear veteran of the burglary unit of 
City Police, said they caught the bur
glars on Elwood Street just two days 
after the Cathedral Mansions bur
glary. After interrogation and the use 
of footage from a Cathedral Mansions 
surveillance camera, Antoine 
Thurston and Marcus Brown were 
identified and charged with 17 
counts of burglary.
Thurston and Brown were not your 
average street hoodlums. In fact, nei
ther had a prior record or rap sheet, 
which made them even harder to 
track down.
According to Mihalcin, Thurston 
had burglarized residences for about 
three months when his friend Brown 
came to him looking for a way to 
make money. Neither man had a drug 
habit and both had families to sup
port.
The only thing in their favor is 
they dont have a record, and they 
were cooperative, said Mihalcin.
Mihalcin said they would likely 
face one to two years of prison time, 
though the alleged crimes could 
incur a maximum penalty of 80 years 
to a century in prison.
The two were caught after 
Detective Hutchings of Carnegie 
Mellon Police faxed to City Police 
images from surveillance video plac
ing the men at Cathedral Mansions 
during the burglary. Thurston was 
identified from other reports as hav
ing gold front teeth, a description 
that matched the footage.
While City Police did all the legwork in the operation, information 
sent in by Carnegie Mellon Police was 
critical in apprehending the alleged 
burglars.
Kevin Graham, Campus Police 
Lieutenant, said that it is through 
hard work, diligence, and coopera
tion that the CMU and City Police are 
able to solve such crimes.
As soon as the burglary occurred 
on Wednesday, November 13, 
Campus Police put up flyers to warn 
residents of the danger of the two 
indebted men who broke into their 
quiet residence hall. Police also asked 
Facilities Management Services to 
tighten the grates and install plates to 
prevent credit cards from opening 
locks in the old building. Though 
effective against credit cards, half a 
coke bottle will still open the doors.
Isaac Dekine, a first-year ECE stu
dent and seventh floor resident, said 
he was happy to hear the burglars 
were caught.
An email was sent... it was a good 
feeling, he said. I could be next.
Natalie Castellana and Meghan 
Laskowski live across the hall from 
the burglarized apartment, both firstyears studying computer science. 
Castellana said she is more careful 
about the security of her laptop since

Jack Kelly, national security writer for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, remains 
skeptical about Saddam Husseins intentions to cooperate with the UN.
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
Saddam Hussein may have 
agreed to permit UN arms inspec
tors to enter Iraq, but Jack Kelly of 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said 
Thursday he expects US troops will 
enter the fight within the next sever
al months. Kelly, who writes about 
national security, said he doubts 
Hussein will comply with inspec
tors, and said there is an 85 to 90 
percent chance the US will be at war 
with Iraq at the beginning of next 
year.
About 250 people filled 
McConomy Auditorium to listen to 
Kelly, a Pitt professor, and an activist 
debate the prospect and '.npact of a 
war with Iraq.
Kelly, a former Green Beret, 
Marine, and a deputy assistant sec
retary of the Air Force, said Hussein 
does not have enough soldiers or 
adequate equipment to defend 
against a US invasion.
Hussein will also have trouble 
moving the troops he does have, 
said Kelly.
Saddam cant make a move 
because our air force will eat them 
alive, he said.
Davis Bobrow, a professor of pub
lic and international affairs and
political science at the University of 
Pittsburgh was met with some 
applause.
We have been at war with Iraq 
more than a decade, he said.
What have been quiet, non-vio
lent political battles may escalate 
into a very different kind of war: one 
of invasion, occupation, and surren
der, said Bobrow. He thinks there is
a smaller chance of war than Kelly 
predicts, and said a war with Iraq is 
not about removing an evil leader 
from power.
Its not about dealing with 
weapons of mass destruction 
because there are more serious 
threats elsewhere, said Bobrow.

i Israeli troops shoot 
'm down UN official
 r ; JERUSALEM (AP)  Israel said 
Saturday its troops fatally shot a UN 
; official during a West Bank firefight 
with Palestinian gunmen because, 
.Palestinians were firing at troops 
'jfrom inside the UN compound and 
^  the official had what appeared to be a 
; bgun. The United Nations denied 
wr*-i Palestinian gunmen were in the UN 
compound and said the slain official, 
Iain Hook, was armed only with a cell 
Ji5 phone he was using to try to evacuate 
UN staff.
Hook, a British senior manager of 
UNRWA, the UN agency helping 
- Palestinian refugees, was killed 
Friday in the compound in the Jenin 
refugee camp  the first senior UN 
JVV' official to die in over two years of 
Israeli-Palestinian fighting.
'The dispute over his death is likely 
to inflame long-strained relations 
w between Israel and the United 
,<4to. Nations: While UN resolutions paved 
 the way for the creation of the Jewish 
" state in 1948, relations have been poi
soned for much of the time since.
The armys preliminary findings 
were released Saturday amid fresh
violence: Two Palestinian militantst  .blew themselves up on an explosives' rJ ' packed boat off the Gaza Strip, injuring four Israeli soldiers on a nearby 
' navy patrol boat in a rare seaborne 
attack. The militant Islamic Jihad 
claimed responsibility.
 '7' Israel also pressed its occupation of 
/'. the West Bank town of Bethlehem, 
reoccupied Friday after a suicide 
bombing in Jerusalem killed 11 peo
ple, four of them children. Israeli 
troops demolished four homes of mil
itants, arrested 26 people, and 
" i searched the office of Bethlehem's 
. governor, witnesses said.
In its statement about the Jenin 
 clash, the army said two soldiers fired 
at Hook inside the UN compound 
because he had an object that 
appeared to be a gun.
The statement said Palestinian 
gunmen had been firing on Israeli 
troops from inside the UNRWA com
pound and, on seven occasions, from 
an adjacent alley. The army said in 
two instances, the gunmen had used 
civilians as human shields, including 
one instance where a gunman hid 
behind a woman holding an UNRWA 
flag. Paul McCann, a UN spokesman, 
said the army's claim that gunmen 
were inside the compound was 
wrong.

Space shuttle rises 
again in Florida
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  
Space shuttle Endeavour streaked 
into orbit Saturday night after weeks 
of delay, carrying up a new set of res
idents and another massive building 
block for the international space sta
tion.
NASA had feared storms in Spain 
might postpone the flight for the sec
ond day in a row. But in the end, the 
rain held off at one of the two over
seas emergency landing strips and 
managers cleared Endeavour and its 
seven astronauts for takeoff.
Looks like weve got a good vehicle 
and good weather tonight for you, 
said launch director Mike Leinbach. 
Have a great flight. I hope you have a 
good turkey dinner packed for 
Thanksgiving.
From the bridge of Endeavour,

replied the commander, James 
Wetherbee.
Endeavour roared to life and lit up 
the clear night sky for miles around. 
The rocketship was visible for seven 
minutes, resembling a bright star as it 
arced over the ocean.
The space station and its three resi-' dents, on board since June, were 
soaring over Austria when Endeavour 
blasted off at 7:49 pm to come get 
them.

^Whitson said from the space station, 
where Endeavour is due to arrive on 
Monday.
The delays were starting to pile up 
for NASAs latest delivery trip to the 
space station, in need of a fresh crew, 
another new girder and spare parts

Endeavour should have flown in 
October, but was grounded until 
November because of cracked fuel 
lines found throughout the shuttle 
fleet. Then during a November 11 
launch attempt, oxygen leaked from a
Our preliminary inquiry does not 
agree with the statement that firing 
could have come from the UNRWA 
compound. It in fact is quite clear 
from our inquiry so far that this 
report of firing from the compound is 
totally incredible, he said.
Hook, he added, had been on his 
cell phone in the moments before he 
was shot, trying to arrange for the 
evacuation of UN personnel from the 
compound.
A UN official from headquarters in 
New York was expected in Jenin on 
Sunday to carry out an investigation 
for the world body, McCann said. 
Meanwhile, Hooks body was expect
ed to be transported to Jerusalem for 
an autopsy before being transferred 
home to Britain.
The United Nations also said that 
Israeli soldiers had blocked an ambu
lance from immediately getting to 
Hook and that he died before reach
ing the hospital. In its statement, the 
army said it expressed sorrow over 
Hooks death. Late Saturday, the 
Palestinian leadership decided to 
award Hook its highest medal, the A1 
Quds Sharif medal, or the Noble 
Jerusalem medal, and declared him a 
martyr of the Palestinian people, 
Palestinian officials said.
Iraq weapons hunt 
pulls UN further in
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  More staff 
and equipment landed here Saturday 
as the UN monitoring agency pre
pared to resume the hunt next week 
for any weapons of mass destruction 
in Iraq.
A half-dozen staff members, along 
with communications gear and com
puters, flew in from a UN rear base in 
Cyprus, UN spokesman Hiro Ueki 
said. Eighteen weapons inspectors 
are scheduled to arrive Monday.
The first inspection will probably 
take place Wednesday, when a UN 
team is expected to revisit one of the 
many sites inspected in the 1990s.
The inspectors are back in Iraq 
under a new Security Council resolu
tion demanding the Iraqis give up any 
weapons of mass destruction or face 
serious consequences.
From 1991 to 1998, UN expert 
teams destroyed large amounts of 
chemical and biological weapons and 
longer-range missiles forbidden to 
Iraq by UN resolutions after the Gulf 
War.
They also dismantled Iraqs nuclear 
weapons program before it could 
build a bomb. The inspections were 
suspended amid disputes over UN 
access to Iraqi sites.

him to write a 10-page reflection 
paper and attend alcohol counsel
ing.
After the student appealed the 
decision, an appeals board reduced 
the sanctions in November 2000, 
giving him a suspended suspen
sion conditional upon his comple
tion of the two other sanctions. The 
altered suspension sentence is 
effectively equivalent to an official 
warning.
Ultimately, the student was 
allowed to remain a full-time stu
dent at Georgetown, participate in 
extracurricular activities and grad
uate with the rest of his class.
The other students involved in 
the confrontation received sanc
tions of ten to 12 hours of commu
nity service. The hearing was not a 
criminal or judicial procedure, nor 
did the US attorney press charges.

Pittsburgh regatta 
may charge fee
PITTSBURGH (AP)  Pittsburghs 
Three Rivers Regatta has been a free 
event for 25 years, but that could 
change when the 26th edition opens 
in August.
The regattas 15-member board 
wants to charge up to $5 a day for 
spectators to enter Point State Park, 
where most regatta festivities are 
held, for the four-day event.
Because Point State Park is owned 
by the state, the organizers have to 
get the General Assembly to pass a 
law allowing the fee. An amendment 
allowing up to a $5 admission fee was 
quietly added to a state Senate bill 
that would allow Sunday liquor sales, 
which could be voted on next week.
I am concerned about administer
ing a fee at a state park, said state 
Senator Jack Wagner, D-Allegheny. 
State parks are free to enter. I can see 
a need for designating certain 
entrances, but not a fee, especially 
without it having been publicly dis
cussed.
But regatta organizers and other 
legislators say an admission fee 
would help weed out drunk and dis
orderly individuals. They say the fee 
is not designed to address the regat
tas deficit in recent years, but it 
would help pay for the event.
Regatta board Chairman Ken 
McCrory said the fee and a proposal 
to surround the open-air park with a 
security fence was proposed by US 
Events and Marketing, the company 
that is paid to manage the regatta.
The company was looking for bet
ter ways for crowd control and for 
keeping disorderly groups out of the 
park, especially at nighttime events, 
McCrory said.Republican state
Senators Tim Murphy and Jane Orie, 
both of Allegheny County, say they 
support the changes.
I look at it as a safety issue, Orie 
said. They would only charge a nom
inal fee.
Wilsons to close 
stores in Pittsburgh
Wilsons The Leather Experts Inc 
has given up on its troubled travel 
stores and will close all 135 of them, 
including two in the Pittsburgh area.
The stores are located in 28 states 
and Puerto Rico and are operated by 
subsidiaries under the El Portal, 
Bentleys Luggage, and California 
Luggage Outlet names. Bentleys 
stores at South Hills Village and the 
Ross Park Mall will close, with liqui
dation sales beginning Friday.
Sales at Wilsons travel stores open 
at least one year fell almost 9 percent 
in the third quarter, compared to the 
same period last year, Wilsons said. 
Same-store sales at Wilsons Leather 
locations were down a more modest 
6.8 percent during the quarter.
Wilsons, based in Brooklyn Park, 
Minn., reported a third-quarter net 
loss of $17 million, or 84 cents per 
diluted share, worse than its thirdquarter 2001 loss of $13.7 million, or 
80 cents per diluted share.
CEO Joel Waller said in a statement 
that the companys focus belongs 
squarely on the core Wilsons Leather 
business.

Roswell crash site 
draws professors
ALBUQUERQUE, NM (UWIRE)  A group of investiga
tors, funded by a television net
work and led by a University of 
New Mexico archeologist, exca
vated the alleged UFO crash site 
in Roswell in September for a 
documentary that will be aired 
November 22.
William Doleman, senior 
archeologist at the UNM Office 
of Contract Archeology, said his 
work on the Roswell excavation 
is top secret and that he signed a 
contract with the SCI FI channel 
preventing him from disclosing 
its results.
Our confidentiality agree
ment with SCI FI does not allow 
me to reveal project results, but 
I can say that OCAs project 
yielded some very intriguing 
and surprising results, 
Doleman said in a UNM Public 
Affairs press release. The project 
is the first attempt to excavate 
physical evidence of the alien 
crash that occurred during the 
summer of 1947, according to 
Doleman. He said that the twohour documentary will include 
background information and 
interviews with key people 
involved with the excavation.
Throughout the project, I 
took care to maintain my and 
OCAs role in the project as 
impassionate researchers pro
viding archeological expertise, 
Doleman said.
Cow heads pop up 
in residence hall
TUCSON, Arizona (U-WIRE)  
Two custodians disposed of a cows 
head found at the bottom of the 
west stairwell in Coronado 
Residence Hall at University of 
Arizona on Tuesday. The cows 
head had initially been found by a 
student, who notified a desk assis
tant.
The desk assistant then 
informed Valerie Ross, a custodian 
on the premises. Ross and 
Elizabeth Raso of Facilities 
Management cleaned up the scene 
by putting the head in a trash com
pactor used by the custodial staff, 
the police report stated.
This is the first time I have ever 
seen anything like this, Raso said.
Raso also reported the unusual 
find to the University of Arizona 
Police Department. Commander 
Brian Seastone said it was difficult 
to determine whether the discov
ery of the cows head was a legiti
mate concern or just a tasteless 
joke.
I would say that something like 
this is definitely out of the blue, 
Seastone said.
Some residents in the dorm had 
no idea of the discovery, but said 
that this is a little more out of the 
ordinary than usual.
I am not really surprised, said 
Katie Anicich, a pre-nursing fresh
man. I have seen a lot of weird 
stuff in this dorm, but that is truly 
bizarre.
I dont believe it  that is really 
out there, said Allison Lee, anoth

African American 
studies expanded
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
More than 30 years ago, opportu
nities in higher education for black 
students matched the overall 
racism toward the black popula
tion in America. Despite the odds, 
black University of Pittsburgh 
University students stepped up 
and demanded a department to 
acknowledge their history. In 
1969, the Pitt became one of the 
first schools in the nation to start a 
African American studies depart
ment.
Friday, that department  now 
called the Africana studies department  disclosed their plans for 
changing and strengthening the 
department to the public in the 
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.
During the course of the last 
year, the department created a 17- 
page document outlining revisions 
to their academic approach and 
the subsequent implications that 
change will have on their mission, 
curriculum, students, faculty, and 
future.
We are determined to move 
ahead, said Joseph K. Adjaye, a 
professor and chair of the depart
ment.
According to Adjaye, in doing 
so, the department focused on 
answering the question of what 
fundamental themes, issues and 
paradigms Pitt students should 
have when they graduate.
The new approach to the 
Africana studies department will 
focus on researching and examin
ing philosophical, social, and indi
vidual transformations associated 
with three cultural patterns.
The first area is formation, 
including African origins and 
African civilizations before 
European colonialism. The second 
area is oppression through 
enslavement, colonialism and 
exploitation, and the effects this 
oppression had on African cul
tures. The final theme is recovery, 
methods and results of resistance, 
and cultural reconstruction.
Unlike other departments, wtudents majoring in Africana studies 
are encouraged not only to 
research the black experience, but 
also to create social change, 
according to Adjaye.
Students protest 
in Fort Benning
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  Kate 
Giammarises cross read Jose Mario 
Pereira, El Mozote, 10 years old. She 
slowly walked up to the gate of Fort 
Benning military base and laid the 
cross against the chain-link fence.
Its pretty overwhelming, all the 
names they read, she later said.
I was trying not to cry as I heard 
the names.
Giammarise, co-chair of Students 
in Solidaritys living wage committee, 
was one of 24 University of Pittsburgh 
students and one of 10,000 people in 
Columbus, Georgia, on Sunday to 
protest the US Army Western 
Hemisphere Institute of Security 
Cooperation, located at Fort Benning.
This is the third time she attended 
to protest.
WHISC, formerly the School of the 
Americas, is a government-funded 
institution that provides profession
al education and training to eligible 
personnel of nations of the Western 
Hemisphere, meaning members of 
the military, police, and civilians, 
while fostering mutual knowledge, 
and promoting democratic values, 
respect for human life, according to 
US Code Title 10, Section 2166.
Recently, the school has come 
under fire from human rights groups 
because, according to the groups, 
graduates of the school are directly 
. related to atrocities in Latin America.
Paul Cooley, Pittsburgh student 
and SIS living wage co-chair, is one of 
the schools critics.
The SOA is a military training 
school that trains Latin American sol
diers to kill their own people, he 
said.
He also said WHISC graduates tar
get union leaders and peace 
activists.
School of the Americas Watch, 
formed in 1990 by Catholic priest Roy 
Bourgeois, holds the protest every 
year during the weekend of 
November 16, the day that six Jesuit 
priests, their co-worker, and her teen
age daughter were killed in 1989.
A Congressional Task Force 
revealed that those responsible were 
trained at the School of Americas, 
according to the School of the 
Americas Watch Web site.
Among the 60,000 graduates of the 
school since its opening in 1947 are 
former Panamanian dictator Manuel 
Noriega and officers responsible for 
the reported massacre of 900 civil
ians in El Mozote, El Salvador.
Counter-protesters held signs say

Carnegie Mellon University have 
forged a strategic partnership that 
combines APLs proven systems engi

pairing positions APL and SEI to offer 
better systems and services to the mil

APL and SEI have complementary 
skills, and our potential to learn from 
each other, to leverage each others 
capabilities, and to support each 
others work is enormous, says APL 
Director Richard T. Roca.
We could always try to do every
thing by ourselves, but working with 
partners  standing on the shoulders 
of people who have gone before us to 
achieve various goals  has got to be 
faster, more cost effective and, 
frankly, a lot more fun.
The partnerships key goal is to 
improve the quality, utility, and inter
operability of complex, software
intensive systems. APL and SEI plan 
to do this by implementing practical 
and flexible software engineering 
practices; developing graduate cours
es and training programs addressing 
the interdependence between soft
ware engineering and systems engi
neering; and sharing technical exper
tise.
SEI Director and Chief Executive 
Officer Stephen E. Cross says the joint 
collaboration will result in a mutual 
broadening of each partys perspec
tive into the others areas of exper
tise.
This is an exciting partnership for 
the SEI. Our collaboration with APL 
demonstrates our commitment to 
improved practices for the engineer

from the other. Officers told the resi
dents of the occupied room that 
though their music was at a tolerable 
level, a report would be generated 
due to recent noise complaints in the 
building.

residue in the homemade pipe, but 
confiscated it.
Loud Party, 11/17/02, 12:47 am
 Officers sent to West Wing about a 
noise complaint found ice cubes lit
tering the fourth floor hallway. Police 
knocked on a door and questioned 
the resident. Although the resident 
had ice inside his room, he denied 
having a party. The complainant RA 
arrived and said she saw a keg in the 
hallway. The resident said he did not 
have a keg and consented to a search. 
Police found the keg and the resident 
claimed it was for personal consump

CMU alums death 
remains a mystery
Carnegie Mellon alumnus Asad 
Zaidi, who died on October 29, was 
found lying down near campus by 
good Samaritans who believed Zaidi 
was a current CMU student, accord
ing to Pittsburgh Police homicide 
detective Jill Smallwood. Zaidi did 
not receive treatment from University 
Health Services, which asked 
University Police to take him to UPMC 
Presbyterian because of his grave con
dition. Because no cause of death has 
been determined, Zaidis death has 
been classified as suspicious.
The Allegheny County coroners 
office will not be able to identify a 
cause of death for another four to six 
weeks while they await the results of 
toxicology tests. An initial examina
tion by a forensic pathologist was 
inconclusive. UPMC Presbyterian had 
called the citys zone 6 police station 
on October 28 to report that Zaidi had 
suffered from food poisoning and was 
not expected to survive. But 
Smallwood said she had no informa
tion that corroborated food poisoning 
as a cause of death.
It is an especially perplexing case, 
said Smallwood, because Zaidi was 
only 25 years old. Zaidi was a 1999 
graduate from the School of 
Computer Science. He was in 
Pittsburgh searching for a research 
position at CMU while he was apply
ing to graduate schools.

According to Laird, though, 
Carnegie Mellon has reached a point 
where space constraints limit the 
amount of possible growth in 
reserch, the largest source of rev
enue growth in recent years.
Carnegie Mellon draws about 5 
percent from its endowment annual
ly, but the endowments $583 million

ble universities.
The Universitys endowment has 
lost ne-third of its value since early

2000, when it was valued at over 
$900 million. But because the endow
ment is relatively small, the 
Ohiversity is much less dependent on 
investment earnings to finance operatiQPS.
 This, administrators say, helps 
Carnegie Mellon avoid budget cuts 
that some of its competitors have had 
to make.
' According to William Elliott, vice 
president of enrollment services and 
temporary vice president of business 
services, wealthier schools endowt6fits will benefit more from the 
market, but they are also hit harder

endowment income.

Of; Carnegie Mellons budget is funded 
thisjway.
> As a result, valuation changes from 
market shifts have a much smaller 
Jnipatt on the Universitys overall 
budget.
During the bull market of the late 
90s, heavily-invested institutions saw 
significant gains in endowment 
value. Acting on these gains, colleges 
expanded facilities and hired more 
faculty. For example, Stanford 
Ufifversity increased staffing by 17 
percent, constructed new buildings, 
and expanded its academic pro
grams.
Now Stanford and many of its peers 
ihii'st make big cuts. Stanford, 
Dartmouth, and Duke have all 
recorded large losses from invest
ments in recent years.
Stanford will again cut its budget 
by at least 5 percent this year, and has 
slowed construction projects and 
placed a freeze on hiring. Dartmouth 
is, among other things, reducing 
course offerings and downsizing its 
library system, while Duke is looking 
to eliminate 30 administrative positions.
J; Being poor has really helped us, 
said Elliott. Its really quite serendip
itous.
! Unlike Stanford, Duke, and others, 
Carnegie Mellon did not greatly alter 
spending when the market was good. 
Because the endowments value was 
small relative to the entire budget, 
higher capital gains did not increase 
operating revenue significantly.
Now the University is not faced 
with budget cuts and students wont 
have to worry about the quality of 
academic programs, at least not this 
year.

A centralized mailroom, a dining 
vendor, and a video game arcade 
would occupy vacant University 
Center basement space in the most 
recent proposal for the UC renova
tion project.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy met with student govern
ment leaders last Wednesday to 
develop an alternative plan that 
would address student and Athletic 
Department complaints expressed at 
a Tuesday, November 19 town hall 
meeting.
Forty undergraduates, graduates, 
and a smattering of faculty met last 
Tuesday to voice opinions about ren
ovating the University Center. The 
crowd waned over the course of the 
two-hour meeting, but it became 
clear that the initial proposal sug
gested by a Student Affairs commit
tee was unacceptable. Students and 
the Athletics Department opposed 
the original plan that would create a 
recreational and eating area on the 
second floor and relocate the athlet
ic facilities to the unoccupied base
ment.
The latest proposal would make 
the second and first floor dining gal
leries that face Merson Courtyard 
hang-out space with overstuffed 
couches and ping-pong, foosball, 
and pool tables. It would also open 
up the adjacent stairwell and con
nect it with the basement, where 
video games would attract a critical 
mass to a smaller, downstairs food 
court, said Student Body President 
Brian Namey.
I think this alternative plan is bet
ter in that it creates new, useful 
lounge and recreational space with
out displacing those who prefer not 
to move, said Namey.
Revenue from the games would 
repay over a 20 year period an 
$800,000 internal loan for construc
tion costs.
The most recent proposal is more 
ambitious in its hangout space, but
the projects cost would be no differ
ent from the original proposals. A 
concrete floor already exists under 
Kirr Commons and the athletic facil
ities would not be rebuilt. The cen
tralized mailroom and dining vendor 
would be funded separately. The 
recreational space will be built con
currently with the Career Center, 
which is moving into 6,000 square 
feet in the basement of the UC. Their 
move is part of a larger space reorga
nization orchestrated by Provost 
Mark Kamlet.
Three months ago, he met with 
several campus departments looking 
for more space, including the devel
opment group of University 
Advancement, who actively seek 
donations and other revenue sources 
for CMU.
Some present at the town meeting 
questioned whether the video games 
would promote slothful behavior 
and others were doubtful that the 
machines would even attract many 
students.
Im not in favor of the recreation
al room, said Athletic Director John 
Harvey. However, thats where the 
revenue will come from. Its an 
unfortunate combination of events 
where we need to create something 
in order to get another thing out of 
it.
The main issue with moving the 
athletic facility to the basement lies 
in the pillars that hold up the build
ing. The basement could house a 
50x50 foot dance room with a pillar 
right in the rooms center. The cur
rent dance room is 40x50 foot. 
Although dance instructors and 
members of Dancers Symposium are 
pleased with more space and the 
square form, they are not in favor of 
the centered pillar, which they 
referred to as death. But now the 
weight, training, and dance rooms 
would remain in their current sec
ond floor space.
According to Harvey, there are 
pros and cons to supporting the orig
inal renovation plan. The configura
tion of the space for the weight room 
would provide more square footage

but it would be less attractive, ambi
ent, and visible.
What we have right now [the cur
rent UC] is not adequate but I dont 
mind keeping it the way it is, said 
Donna Morosky, director of fitness 
and health.
Students said that the current 
location of the glass workout rooms 
alongside the dining area is strange, 
but the alternative plan would add 
more dining tables in the corridor
that connects second floor food ven
dors and the Danforth Lounge.
Its kind of a weird juxtaposition, 
said Matt Larochu, a first-year CS 
major. Im watching people play 
squash while Im eating dinner. It 
just seems sensible that dining 
should be separate from the workout 
rooms. The recent proposal would 
mean additional seating in other 
parts of the UC should student
Murphy said that the end desire is
a place for more mingling and an 
opportunity to just relax, which is 
reliant on the revenue from its own 
activities. The games would not 
detract from that core goal but dif
ferent options for recreation are now 
being considered.
Other issues such as the base
ments ventilation and lighting sys
tem and the consolidation of Skibo 
Gymnasium and the weight room 
were brought up.

premium on oil if that is all its 
about, Kelly said.
The speakers were also asked how 
war would affect US relations in the 
Middle East. Kelly said the impact 
would be almost none.
Arab governments react chiefly to 
power, said Kelly. He said the US 
will win if they go to war and this 
will only intensify support, not dis
rupt compliance.
Anti-American sentiment rises in 
those times when America appears 
weak.
Bobrow said the US will have to 
rely on surrounding countries to 
deploy troops, and that Arab govern
ments will comply. Theyll be glad 
that were tied down so that our 
dependency on them will go up, 
Bobrow said.
When asked how President Bush 
can justify threatening to declare 
war on Iraq for violating UN regula
tions when other countries like 
Israel, Turkey, China, and Russia, 
who have even more UN violations, 
are not threatened with war, Kelly 
said its because Hussein is a heinous 
man, and no one knows what he is 
capable of.
Were trying to force UN resolu
tions on Iraq because at the moment 
he is the worst guy around, Kelly 
said. He said the Iraqi leader possibly 
has ties to al Qaida. After the debate 
Kelly said he does not see Hussein as 
an immediate threat.
Hed [Saddam Hussein] be a real 
friggin idiot to piss off George Bush 
right now. I doubt that he is right 
now plotting, said Kelly.
Bobrow said the UN could com
promise with other countries.
I think its all about whether we 
can bargain with the other party anH 
what we think the price of temperin; 
would be, he said.

Tanya Tarr organized the debate. 
She said she invited speakers who 
would represent different view
points.
This is probably the closest thing 
you can get to objectivity, she said.
In general, I thought it was a pret

appreciated a more radical perspec

wards to discuss planning further 
events.

the burglary.
I had [a laptop lock] but I didnt 
lock it when I wasnt here, she said.
Ben Mosier, a sophomore engineer
ing major and also a resident of the 
floor said he wasnt too concerned 
about the break-in or about extra 
security measures.
We had someone come in and do 
something to the door, he said.
In 99 percent of break-ins no one 
is physically hurt, said Mihalcin.
Thurston and Brown did not enter 
the building looking for a junkies fix 
or an easy meal ticket. The pair faced 
debt and child support payments, 
according to Mihalcin.
They just wanted the money for 
living, he said.
The burglars were apprehended 
due to cooperation among area police 
departments. Recently, Carnegie 
Mellon Police, in an initiative led by 
Detective Martin White, moved to for
malize the communication between 
local crime prevention units into a 
Crime Information Network involving 
standard emails and monthly meet
ings.
The bizarre CatMan burglars were 
the first suspects generated from this 
newly-formed network.

Faculty Senate looks at food issues!;
by Alex Meseguer
Asst. Science & Technology Editor
Dining Services and Parkhurst 
have experienced some short-term 
success. Last week, their Schatz din
ing hall attendance records were 
shattered when over 450 students 
went to the Thanksgiving all-youcare-to-eat dinner buffet. According 
to the Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC) food committee, Schatz saw 
its attendance go up from 330 people 
on November 5 to 383 the following 
week and finally hit 451 this past 
Tuesday. With nearly 400 of the din
ers being first-year students, the 
weekly buffet is a hit with the meal 
plan-dependent crowd.
Dining Services also met with CMU 
Earth, the student environmental 
club, this past Wednesday. In the 
meeting minutes on the organiza
tions website, CMU Earth noted their 
successes with Dining Services. 
Schatz will no longer use polystyrene 
and will offer discounts to customers 
with refillable mugs of any type. The 
minutes also noted that while Skibo 
staff was doing well with recycling, 
Parkhurst employees were being 
retrained in recycling techniques.
And despite Dining Services 
efforts to better serve the student 
population, not everyone thinks that 
the food situation is being addressed 
adequately.
Im bothered by the fact that [food 
quality] is seen as a financial issue 
and not a quality of life issue ... I
think everyone would agree that the 
food is too expensive and not 
healthy, said Kenya Dworkin, 
Faculty Senate executive committee 
member and assistant professor in 
modern languages.
Neil Hunt, SDC food chair, also 
expressed his concerns that although 
the Schatz dining experience is a suc
cess, it still only applies to a fraction 
of the first-year population and that 
there is still much dissatisfaction 
among students about dining.
Claudia Kirkpatrick, vice chair of 
the University Student Affairs 
Council, asked Michael Murphy, 
dean of student affairs, what was 
being done by the University to 
address dining dissatisfaction. 
Kirkpatrick, a senior lecturer in man
agement communication, reported at 
the meeting that William Elliot, vice 
president of enrollment, had been 
assigned to review and examine 
Dining Services thoroughly. Elliot 
refused to comment on his actions, 
except to say that no allegations of 
mistreatment by Parkhurst managers 
reported in the The Tartan on 
November 4 had been substantiated.
Both Kirkpatrick and Hunt report
ed that the administration was wellinformed of all the complaints stu
dents had about food on campus, 
including the lack of a central dining 
location. Since Neal Binstock, assis
tant vice president for Business 
Services, ultimately closed
Highlander Caf in 2001, the 
University has lacked a communal 
cafeteria. According to Kirkpatrick,
one of the major issues is creating a 
community. Students do not feel like 
they have someplace inviting arid 
large which provides a casual place to 
eat.
Whether the [dining] venue', i^ 
centralized or distributed ... these 
issues will always be on the table. 
The question of what services the 
university should provide have to be 
analyzed from the bottom up, said 
Juan Jorge Schaffer, a professor of 
math and Faculty Senate member.
Schatz dinner really has had an 
impact on the impression that [firstyears] have had of Dining [Services], 
... people look forward to Tuesday 
nights and are excited about it, they 
are really happy to be there, said 
Neil Hunt, SDC Food Chair.
At the behest of SDC Food, Dining 
Services added a second serving sta
tion and additional seating to accom
modate more patrons and reduce 
waiting times. According to SDC 
Food, most people waited less than 
20 minutes to enter the dining hall, 
with the busiest times being between 
5:50 and 6:20 pm.
Dining has dragged their legs foi^ 
little while on this, but in the last fevfc 
weeks theyve stepped it up ... its a 
draining venture, we went through 
175 pounds of turkey on Tuesday, 
said Hunt. The space is small and 
limited, but were doing all we can. 
Although the expanded capacity 
opened up the Tuesday night dining 
experience to more people, students 
were still turned away by the long 
lines, according to Hunt. t < <v.

We have had a rough semester

Richelmi left Senates last meeting 
before the roll call vote on the 
Freedom of Information policy.
I had a huge project due on 
Friday, he said. Richelmi was not 
the only individual to leave the 
meeting early on Thursday night. 
Proceedings began at 6 pm and did 
not conclude until 8:45 due to a 
lengthy presentation on University 
health care and uncertainty about 
the guidelines for conversation on 
the Senate floor. During the 
Senates motion to endorse the plan, 
a motion to delay the vote was intro
duced, confusing some senators.
Could I please have a clarifica
tion of where we are in the meet
ing? asked student body president 
Brian Namey.
Another large portion of the 
meeting was invested in discussing 
the Freedom of Information policy. 
Despite the bills passage, the policy 
will not go into effect until it passes 
in the graduate student assembly 
and is signed by Namey, who 
reminded Senate of his veto powers 
during the meeting. The policy has 
caused a great deal of discussion in

for this.
Before hiring Dively in August, the University 
had received legal counsel from the law firm of 
DeForest and Koscelnik for nine years. Although 
the University has now taken on full-time legal 
counsel, Dively predicts that CMUs legal budget 
will go down.
Theoretically, it always should be less expensive 
to do things in-house than to hire outside counsel. 
You have a whole overhead of support that you 
have to pay for, said Dively. She explained that the 
University would still use outside counsel in spe
cialized cases that are outside of her areas of exper
tise.
I didnt want to start with anyone because I 
wanted to get here and see what the workflow was, 
so I could figure out what the skill sets were that I 
needed, she said.
Dively said that she is currently the sole member 
of the legal department and intends to hire anoth
er lawyer in the next six months.
As part of her new position, Dively is responsible 
for the review of all sponsored research contracts 
accepted by the University. Each research grant 
requires a contract negotiation and approval 
process, she said.
After the contracted research is complete, the 
University faces a new round of legal negotiations. 
Any product or technology that the University 
wishes to commercialize and license to another 
company needs a series of contracts and a subse
quent legal review. Throughout the process, the 
Universitys legal department must protect its fac
ulty, researchers, students, and endowment 
against lawsuits.
Another of Divelys tasks will include work on 
the libraries database software licenses, which the

Feds kill state drug reform laws
But Walters wasnt the only public official at 
fault. For example, in Ohio, where voters 
rejected Issue 1, a ballot measure favoring 
treatment, not jail time, for drug offenders, 
Republican Governor Bob Taft raised an esti
mated $1 million from contributors. Walters 
was meanwhile running television ads in the 
Buckeye State on the dangers of marijuana, 
and all on the publics dime. The Drug Czar 
likewise made trips to Nevada and Arizona, 
where decriminalization efforts were being 
pushed by petitioners. Jennifer Devallance, 
spokeswoman for the 0NCP, defended her 
bosss job to go across the country and educate 
people about the dangers of drugs. And with 
an annual war chest estimated at $20 billion, 
whats to stop him?
The shame of this whole sorry affair was that 
President Bush ran on a platform of returning 
meaning to the 10th Amendment. The current 
trashing of states rights for political gain indi
cates Bush cares as much about federalism as 
his predecessor did. Advocates for drug policy 
change can claim a glimmer of hope, however. 
According to the Drug Policy Alliance, a pro
reform organization, the previous election 
cycle brings the total number of victories for 
the policy change faction to 19 out of 24 since 
1996. We could have seen the 2002 ballot ini
tiatives added to that list, were it not for a few 
questionable tactics from Walters, the ONDCP, 
and the White Houses bottomless pockets. 
Your tax dollars at work.
Looks like Ashcroft and his boys are at it 
again. In a staggering example of federal 
hubris, its come to light in the past week that 
the Office of National Drug Control Policy 
(ONDCP) allegedly used public funds to help 
defeat several state drug initiatives. This time 
Drug Czar John Walters has stumped across 
the country, from New Hampshire to Nevada, 
in order to put down a number of measures 
that advocated the sale of medical marijuana 
and treatment programs in lieu of mandatory 
sentences. While its no secret that The Tartan 
doesnt approve of Attorney General Ashcroft 
and his Justice Departments war on drugs, 
what Walters has done goes beyond the pale. It 
is one thing to disseminate information on the 
federal governments narcotics stance, it is 
quite another to actively politick against votersponsored initiatives on a state level.
The ordeal started on November 20, when 
Fox News reported that members of the drug 
reform lobby, the Marijuana Policy Project, 
announced they were considering filing suit 
against the federal government, particularly 
the ONDCP, for broadening the White House 
scope in the current legal climate.
Said Project spokesman Bruce Merkin, 
There are legal, and frankly, moral questions 
here, particularly when you consider that he 
[Walters] went through some effort in his cam
paign to demonize those who were running 
these initiatives while he runs his own cam
paign with an open checkbook of taxpayer 
money.
Bum Lee/Art Editor
Caution on 3/2 programthat Kappa Phi Lambda is non-exclusive, yet no members are of dif
ferent ethnicities. If the sorority really does support its broad aims, 
then one must ask what is the nature of their recruitment? I cannot 
think of any instance where the Asian-interest groups actively tried to 
recruit anyone I know. If membership is only offered to those in cer
tain cliques, the label non-exclusive must be cast off. I am also inter
ested in how Asian these groups really are. How many members are 
Indian, Nepali, or Vietnamese? I have not seen how these groups have 
aided in the promotion of cultural understanding.
If one were to create an organization on campus promoting 
Western European culture, what would happen to that organization? 
I am sure that it would succumb to pressure from the campus and the 
administration to dissolve because of its racist nature. What makes 
these organizations any different?
Having lived in a small farming community, I have seen the results 
of racism many times. In high school one of my friends was beaten 
because he was an African-American, and the guilty party took pride 
in being the one who beat that nigger. Events such as this have rein
forced my desire to see more understanding between ethnic groups. 
It is my belief that the aforementioned groups do not accomplish their 
published aims of promoting cultural diversity. When I see that 
change I may appreciate these groups more, but the only promotion 
of Asian culture that I see on campus is directed towards other Asians.
Dear Editor,
Concerning the upcoming rollout of an integrated MBA/BS 
program for CIT students (CIT students offered five year 
MBA/BS, 11/18), I caution anyone who may jump at the oppor
tunity without careful consideration of what it takes to be suc
cessful in the program.
I am honored to be the first since 1995 to be accepted to the 3/2 
program [for undergraduate business majors], and I encourage 
other qualified applicants to pursue this course of study I also 
strongly encourage the creation of more integrated degree oppor
tunities for undergraduates. I believe many students, however, 
may apply to these programs with the wrong intentions.
Let me dispel a few rumors. First, an integrated MBA/BS does 
not increase your chances of getting a job! In this economy, its 
tough to get a job, period. Second, getting your MBA is not easy. If 
you are considering the program, take your time commitments as 
an undergrad and double them. Third, an MBA does not guaran
tee a higher salary; the degree only provides you with a toolkit 
while your practical business exposure determines your compen
sation.
So, what is the experience like? MBA students are a tight-knit 
family. Students take 8-10 classes each semester (in a mini-semes
ter format), and its all about business. An MBA does not make 
you a better engineer or scientist. It teaches you to examine the 
world as a manager, and develop the toolkit to make solid strate
gic business decisions.
If your goal is to be an engineer, be an engineer. The MBA pro
gram breeds managers, and managerial prowess comes with 
observation and experience. It is a hefty academic, financial, and 
social commitment. If business is simply an interest, consider it as 
a double major or minor.
If business is a passion, however, consider the new MBA/BS 
program. Seek out myself or other current MBA students for 
advice. Perhaps sit in on a couple of classes. Form a strategy for 
applying at least a year in advance, and recognize what you need 
to make your application as strong as possible.
Most importantly, remember that an MBA is only one of many 
possibilities that can help you achieve your goals.
At just about any time of day or night, if you 
walk down the hallway of student organization 
offices on the third floor of the University 
Center, you pass the open doors of the Thistle 
yearbook, The Tartan, and Activities Board. 
When you reach the Skibo third floor lounge, 
there is one more organizations door that is 
closed about as much as their information  
Student Senate. Rarely does the government 
body burn the midnight oil like other student 
groups who work tirelessly to contribute to the 
campus community. And its beginning to neg
atively impact not just the details of your daily 
life at Carnegie Mellon, but also threatens to 
thwart any chance at the long-term improve
ment of student life. .
Student Senate is a student organization just 
like any other. It must recruit members, pro
vide them with incentives to prolonged 
involvement, and publicize their activity to the 
student body. Unfortunately, Senate has done 
none of that. There was minimal advertise
ment of petition deadlines for candidates and 
election day for the student body. They can no 
longer expect power to be a drawing card 
among first-years. There is so little respect for 
their ability to effectively change campus life 
that the College of Fine Arts apparently does 
not recognize their sovereignty. Perennial can
didate Optimus Prime was elected senator for 
CFA with two votes.
Senates semester-long masterpiece is the 
Freedom of Information Act, a bill that would 
disclose the line items of student organization
budgets. Students deserve to know what their 
activities fee pays for without restriction. It is 
an admirable piece of legislation and we were 
encouraged it to see it pass Senate last week. 
But only half the Senate voted on the important 
measure because of absences and vacancies.
Michael Sebetich, the former Student Body 
Treasurer and a past student senator says 
Senate leadership is abysmal and it certainly 
reflects poorly on the organization when 
Senate Chair Paul Richelmi leaves the meeting 
before the vote. We dont fault Richelmis rea
soning (homework) for the departure, but it 
was because of him that the meeting dragged 
on for close to three hours! Someone has to 
seize control when a meeting begins to wander 
aimlessly like it did last week. If the leadership 
has failed, we wonder why their student activi
ties advisor, Denise Fazio has not addressed the 
egregious situation. Does Dean Michael 
Murphy recognize the grave condition that this 
feeble government is in?
We dont want to kick a student organization 
when its down, but Student Senate is entrust
ed with our cash and our voices. If we wanted a 
government dole, the University could save us 
all the headache and just assign that task to an 
assistant dean. Closed-door politicking is not a 
productive solution when a group is publicly in 
shambles. Someone must answer the call and 
take control of this lackadaisical and disorga
nized group, whether it is their advisor Murphy 
or a student government leader. Open the door 
and show us that Senate can still perform.

UGA prof chimes in on GM food
Dear Editor,
I will begin by thanking Karen Hoffmann for doing a great job in 
tackling a thorny issue in Genetically modified foods and plants stir 
controversy last week. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of 
points. First, Ms. Hoffmann points out that there is nothing new on 
the label to indicate anything different about these foods. The rea
son for the lack of a label is there is nothing new in the food. Genetic 
engineering is a process, not a product. Sometimes this process adds 
new things to the food; sometimes it does not. In the case of engi
neered crops currently in the market, engineering has not affected 
the composition or safety of the food. At some future date (as in the 
case of the golden rice, also mentioned by Ms. Hoffmann), engineer
ing will alter the content of the food; and yes, it will have to be 
labeled, according to rules set up by the FDA in 1992.
Ms. Hoffmann also refers to the terrible situation in Zambia, which 
has officially rejected food aid from the US because it contains the 
same genetically engineered corn routinely eaten by most residents of 
the United States. One excuse that is given is that Zambia does not 
want to endanger its exports to the European Union. No one has yet 
explained how milled corn can contaminate any other crop. For that 
matter, Zambia is a corn importer, not exporter. Safety issues get lost 
among the politics.
Finally, as to the assertion that engineered crops make farmers 
dependent on companies, as they cannot save their seed, let me say 
that 1) farmers stopped saving seed when hybrid corn was intro
duced in the 1930s, and have been buying new seed every year since 
then; 2) farmers became dependent on companies for their agri
chemicals after WWII. At least now, farmers have a choice of chemi
cal-intensive agriculture or biotech agriculture, which is reducing 
pesticide usage and promoting conservation practices, such as no-till 
agriculture.
CMU dining too hard to swallow
Joshua A. Gerlick 
MBA Class of 2004
The University needs to cut its losses with 
Parkhurst or reevaluate their current relation
ship. At the last Faculty Senate meeting, senior 
communications lecturer Claudia Kirkpatrick 
reported that Vice President of Enrollment 
William Elliot has been assigned to review and 
examine Dining Services. Elliot said he has not 
substantiated allegations of mistreatment 
made by Dining employees in The Tartan, but 
that his investigation will continue.
Dining has come to the forefront as the most 
heated student life issue on campus. A new 
dorm springs up, yet food continues to swirl 
the bowels of students. Course offerings multi
ply, yet food variety remains the same disap
pointing status quo. Will it take roaches skitter
ing from the kitchens for the University to final
ly consider Dining a problem?
Record-breaking numbers of diners at 
Schatz once-a-week All-You-Care-to-Eat buffet 
do little to mitigate the crisis in dining. SDC
and the University point to Schatz as their bea
con of hope. Instead they should seek broad, 
long-term solutions to combat the overall stag
nation of campus dining. Dining Services and

This is no Catch-22. All over the country, uni

Carnegie Mellon must step up to the plate

Parkhurst cannot offer good food at low prices, 
the University should find someone who can.
New campus Greeks means 
more social barriers
Dear Editor,
After reading your recent article on the formation of another 
Asian-interest group on campus (Women form Asian interest 
sorority, 11/11/02), I was alarmed, but not because of young 
women running around campus in uniforms. I was disturbed 
because socially damaging practices are allowed to continue on 
this campus.
Organizations such as Lambda Phi Epsilon, Pi Delta Psi, and 
now Kappa Phi Lambda claim to promote cultural understanding 
and diversity, yet are severely lacking the latter. One of the 
biggest problems on this campus is the formation of cliques that 
separate diverse groups from one another. The article states that

Introduction to Business, fending for one
self?
Carnegie Mellon isnt about learning as 
much as it is about career preparation. I was 
reading a story in the Pittsburgh City Paper 
about the Africana Studies department at 
Pitt. (On a side note, one of tremendous 
advantages of being editor is reading every
one elses work and getting ideas for The 
Tartan, henceforth known as the paper.)
The reporter interviewed Curtis Porter, 
who was a graduate student and leading 
organizer of the Black protest movement at 
the University of Pittsburgh in 1969. He and 
another grad student, Jack Daniel, who is 
now ironically Pitts current Dean of 
Students and Vice Provost of Academic 
Affairs, seized control of the schools main
frame computer and demanded that 
Chancellor Wesley Posvar meet seven previ
ously outlined points; adding to the list was 
that there would be no school or legal action 
taken against the two rebels. After a sixhour silent lock-in, the Chancellor agreed to 
their demands, setting forth in motion a 
plan that would produce a Black Studies 
program. Porter is now the chief executive 
officer of the McKeesport campus of Penn
State University. He told the reporter one of 
the higher educations biggest taboos, espe
cially at places like CMU: Most students 
dont go to college for in-depth scholarly 
review; they go for a four-year degree to 
make them a marketable person.
I already knew that. Ive watched my 
peers jockey for internships since freshman 
year. You could probably count on one hand 
the number of students who came to CMU 
for in-depth scholarly review. I certainly 
didnt, nor have I received anything of the 
sort from most courses, and I regret it. But 
after reading the CP story, I didnt know 
what I was more upset about  the despon
dency of a future in which even the rebel
lious join the establishment or the fact that I 
saw nothing as spectacular as a student sitin while editor at The Tartan. The last part 
was the first lesson at the paper, everything 
is a news story. The first part, the hopeless 
biological tendency to succumb to the main
stream, is only a passing liberal fad.
But students go to Carnegie Mellon not 
because they want to find themselves as 
its said, but because they want to get a highpaying job when they graduate. If you hap

observant scholar along the way, good for

The Marshall Plan: Some critics cant stop praising Eminem
Attaq Iraq now; weapons 
inspections just a mirage
Jeff Cullers
Right now Saddam Hussein is at home in one of his many presidential 
palaces, laughing. He is laughing at ten years of failed attempts to disarm 
him. He is laughing at a United States that still chooses to be held hostage 
by a gullible and gutless UN. He is laughing at everyone who still takes his 
word despite his systematic policy of lying.
If I were Saddam I would be amused, too. The international community 
and the UN have played Iraqs games for years and refuse to learn. It is 
absolutely evident that Saddam possesses weapons of mass destruction and 
anyone who believes otherwise should count themselves as yet another fool 
for Saddam to suffer. How many times have Saddam and Iraq promised 
to get rid of their weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)? Iraq signed the 
1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, despite continuously attempting to 
acquire nukes and potentially distribute them to terrorists, to whom 
Saddam gives sanctuary. Iraq is a signatory to the 1972 Convention 
Prohibiting Chemical and Biological Weapons, but Saddam gassed north
ern Kurds anyway. Iraq subscribed to a January 1989 agreement in Geneva 
with the objective of universally eliminating chemical and biological 
weapons. Two years later, Allied troops and inspectors destroyed thousands 
of Iraqs combat-ready chemical weapons, including sarin-equipped Scud 
missies.
Saddam stands in even greater defiance of the UN, most significantly 
during and after the Gulf War. Resolution 660 of August 1990 demanded 
his withdrawal from Kuwait. When he did not comply, Resolution 678 of 
November 1990 set a January 15 deadline before member states would use 
all means necessary to remove him. The deadline came and went with no 
action from Saddam, prompting the Gulf War  one of the few times that 
the UN had the courage to actually enforce a resolution. After the war, 
Resolution 687 required Iraq to submit a report of its WMDs, allow inspec
tions, and follow sanctions placed on Iraq until it could prove that it not 
longer possessed weapons.
Then the UN vanished. Special Commission (Unscom) inspectors were 
only allowed to inspect sites detailed in Iraqs report; this stems from the 
risible assumption that Saddam will openly disclose the locations of his 
WMDs. Saddam let inspectors in, but they were repeatedly blocked and 
even fired upon while the UN, in another act showing its supreme impo
tence, issued Resolution 707 in August 1991.The UN demanded again that 
Iraq honestly disclose all its WMDs. Resolutions 715, 989,1051,1060,
1115,1134, and 1137 continued to demand Iraqs cooperation with 
Unscom. Iraq repeatedly blocked sites from inspectors until the UN threat
ened action, thereby giving Saddam enough time destroy whatever incrimi
nating evidence he had. In 1998, Kofi Annan himself visited Iraq, gave 
Saddam the benefit of the doubt, and secured a pledge from Iraq to cooper
ate fully with all UN resolutions and Unscom inspectors. Yet months later, 
in November, Saddam kicked out the Unscom inspectors. The US threat
ened missile strikes and so Saddam, per his usual behavior, gave in, delay
ing an attack for another month. On December 17,1998, the US and UK 
decided that the only way to be sure of containing Saddams weapons pro
gram was three days of bombing. Inspectors have not returned since.
Now we have yet another UN decision: Security Council resolution 1441 
demands that Iraq declare its WMDs and cooperate with inspectors by 
December 8. Supposedly it is Saddams last chance. Sound familiar?
Iraq has agreed to let in inspectors pursuant to SC 1441, but this means

ground as the kid from the wrong side of town. 
Rabbit, and to a larger degree Eminem himself, is 
battling for respect as much as he is lyrical suprema
cy. What is not as clear, however, and perhaps unin
tentional, is the scenes elephant in the room; it is 
race, the white kind, and nobody seems to want to 
discuss it.
For all the braying from critics about how Ems 
film trumps race in favor of class and the heros tale, 
8 Mile, and Eminems newest offering, The Eminem 
Show, couldnt be more about skin color. And here is 
where the Chedder Bob scene is most telling: the two 
characters, both white, take comfort in each others 
solidarity, not their shared working-class roots, but 
their whiteness. Even in the putatively colorblind 
hip-hop culture, it at once sets them apart and pulls 
them together. When it comes to his race or his 
music, Eminem just cant seem to get past himself. 
The feting that has accompanied 8 Mile by critics, 
most of whom are white, proves that they them
selves cant seem to surmount it, either.
That film reviews like the one from gushy New 
York Times critic Frank Rich coo over the Rocky-like 
plotline and the class-conscious story while forget
ting the constant vilification of females by Eminem, 
on celluloid as well as vinyl. It underscores one 
thing: white critics can forgive depravity and boorish 
lyrics, chalking it up to innocent pop posturing, 
because individuals like Rich dont so much like rap 
as what it does for them. Bobs withering excuse - I 
just didnt want them making fun of me - could just

law wrongly upheld
Obstruct Terrorism, defied any American to take issue 
with it. The government explained that the act was a 
demonstration of patriotism. Sensing a nationwide unity 
of purpose and duty not felt since World War II, we 
agreed.
Today, Afghanistans Taliban and al Qaida have been all 
but destroyed. The threat of terror, while just as real, is 
less urgent and immediate. The US, formerly drunk on 
patriotism and solidarity, has sobered up. And, like any 
good morning after, we need to make amends for what we 
did the night before.
The USA PATRIOT Act, as it stands, is unconstitutional. 
The FISA courts May ruling on wiretaps and surveillance 
should be upheld. And the rest of the Act needs to be 
revised if we are to salvage any of the Constitution, most 
notably the Fourth Amendment, from the pyre burning at 
the altar of Homeland Security.
But arent the drastic measures of the USA PATRIOT Act 
the only way to deal with the looming threat of modern 
terrorism?
Desperate times do call for desperate measures. 
However, history has shown that the FBI rarely concerns 
itself with quaint ideas like the rule of law or constitu
tionality when dealing with potential threats to national 
security. Reports released by the FISA court in August 
document 75 cases of incorrect and misleading informa
tion in FBI wiretap applications within the last 15 years. 
The FBI has owned up to each of these 75 gaffes.

In the recent working-class film noir 8 Mile, direc
tor Curtis Hanson presents his viewers with a scene 
brimming with unintended irony. The spectacle in 
question involves our hero, Eminem as Rabbit (or BRabbit or Bunny Rabbit or some other hip-hop sobri
quet recycled during the films battle rap interludes) 
consoling one of the members of his troika of fools, 
er friends, Chedder Bob. Bob is recovering in his 
home after an unfortunate accident with a pistol 
leaves him with a hole in his thigh. When Rabbit and 
his ne r-do-well crew roll up to see their stricken 
comrade, nobodys home. After his friends have 
decided that Bob isnt around they leave Rabbit, who 
sneaks to the back of the house and lets himself in 
the back door. Bob is lying prone on the couch, too 
embarrassed to answer the door. Such is what the 
mis-holstering of a .45 followed by a gun blast down 
your pants leg will get you, I suppose.
I just didnt want them making fun of me, whim
pers Bob. You know what I mean? Rabbit obliges 
with one of the films ever-present thoughtful stares 
and offers, Yeah, I know.
On the face of it, what Hanson and screenwriter 
Scott Silver meant for this scene is clear enough: 
Chedder Bob, in his own way , is an echo chamber 
for Rabbits larger dilemma 1 namely, trying to eke 
out a square of dignity in Detroits hip-hop underSuper Patriot? Bush
Cleaned your room lately? Not the floors or the bath

Last Monday, a three-judge panel from the US Circuit 
Court of Appeals validated the new USA PATRIOT Act. 
The judges overturned a May ruling issued by the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court that said the acts 
wiretap provisions violate the Constitution by failing to 
safeguard citizen privacy.
Think back to 14 months ago. Still reeling from our 
most devastating domestic attack ever, we needed repara
tions. Something had to be done to ensure that a disaster 
like September 11 never happened again.
Our government heard our cries. In six short weeks, 
Congress drafted and enacted the USA PATRIOT Act, pro
viding the FBI and law enforcement agencies with much 
broader wiretap and surveillance capabilities, better 
access to personal records, and the capability to hold nonUS citizens without charges for up to seven days if sus
pected of terrorist activity.
Congress and President Bush assured the nation that 
these were the measures necessary to combat todays ter
rorists, and who would argue? The acronym itself, USA

Eminem Show is turning into a bad rerun
EMINEM, from page A7
as easily be appropriated by Rich and 
other arbiters of high art as a defense 
for the vicarious coolness that only a 
white rapper can provide for them.
Writing in Novembers Harpers 
Magazine, Shelby Steele of the con
servative Hoover Institute lamented 
the marginalization of the black indi
vidual in our post-Civil Rights era due 
to the burdens placed upon him by 
his membership in an oppressed 
group. Steele goes on to argue that it 
is not only these obligations which 
diminish individual black identity but 
white guilt as well. Good-intentioned 
white liberals, eager to accommodate 
blacks, sack them with group dynam
ics at every turn. The result is a racial 
politics so mired in identity issues 
that it forsakes individual merit in 
favor of a rising tide that will presum
ably lift all ships, as is the case with 
affirmative action and certain hiring 
practices. What Steele fails to 
acknowledge is that the white guilt
has another, overlooked, wrinkle.
What this guilt has created, it 
seems, is a respect  reverence even
 for artists able to cross over into a 
black genre and then bemoan their lot 
as a misunderstood white boy once in 
it. The glass ceiling for white rappers 
was breached by Eminem not merely 
because he is immensely talented at 
what he does, but also because 
American culture has experienced a 
seismic shift in the past fifteen years.
Beginning with the Beastie Boys, 
urban hip-hop quickly flooded subur
ban airwaves, and the response was 
unanimous. White kids adopted 
black culture with ceaseless enthusi
asm, as have American marketers and 
advertisers.
As author and educator John 
McWhorter has argued, the landscape 
of white America is now grayed, hav
ing accepted African-American tradi
tions and habits into its popular cul
ture. And this is a good thing. What 
some of the white intelligentsia does
nt seem to get is that the 8 Mile Road
of hip-hop has been turned into 
Detroits own Rubicon; the old barri
ers, especially in music, dont apply 
any more. But still white guilt and the 
longing to penetrate an imagined 
racial divide propels acts like Eminem 
and his supplicants in the press.
Eminem is a talented hip-hop artist. 
But his movie 8 Mile is a tenden
tious piece of race-baiting. It uses 
white-black antagonisms to hook you 
into its climatic ending as freely as Em 
himself uses homosexist lyrics to get 
your attention in his songs. 
Unfortunately, some of the film's crit
ics haven't picked up on the racial 
aspects of the movie, instead slavishly 
congratulating 8 Mile for its broad 
vision, while at once impoverishing 
any lucid debate on color in America 
with their deification of one white 
rapper.

you. Its certainly not required. And 
we, CMU, have no intentions of 
changing. We call ourselves problem-solvers, but what we really 
mean is corporate shills for hire.
In a story in todays News sec
tion, Nick Ennis reports that 
research money accounts for 40.5 
percent of the schools revenue. Of 
the $223 million worth of research 
funds, a third comes from the 
Department of Defense (DoD). 
Obviously, research dollars keep 
this University afloat and they are a 
critical component of CMUs identi
ty and future. But its also the 
schools biggest shortcoming. That 
cash isnt going to H&SS, a bloated, 
aimless coalition of castaways and 
mendicants. The place where indepth scholarly review is most 
likely to occur at a college, has one 
of the highest acceptance rates at 
CMU (54.3 percent) and practical
ly zero prestigious alumni who can 
give back the millions needed to 
breathe life into the dying college.
If Carnegie Mellons goal was to 
become a better holistic institution 
then we wouldnt read the barrage 
of press releases about the Robotics 
Institutes tank or the MBA pro
gram that will be offered to CIT 
undergraduates. Incidentally, GSLA. 
says it offers an accelerated MBA 
degree for its lowly business under
grads, but only two students have 
been accepted to the program in 
the past seven years. There are cer
tain qualities that make a CIT grad
uate an ideal candidate for busi
ness school, but its a crock that a 
business undergrad student pays 
the same amount as the CIT under
grad and doesnt get the same 
return on their investment.
One other business lesson I can 
remember: if a division is worth 
less than its tangible assets, sell it. 
CMU should focus on what it does 
best and outsource its humanities 
to Pitt, Duquesne, and other local 
schools. Kind of like how the DoD 
outsources its software research to 
us.
One other thing Ive learned at 
the paper is that honesty and forth
rightness are the hallmarks of not 
only a good story, but also a good 
public image for a source. And 
right now, Mr. Cohon, CMUs hon
esty is as transparent as my degree.

PATRIOT, from page A7
Knowing that the FBI is going to 
stretch the law anyway, do we need 
to broaden it further for them?
When you start expanding author
ity like this to where theres no stan
dard, all you increase are the num
ber of innocent people who are surveilled unnecessarily. This from 
Joshua L. Dratel, in a brief filed by 
the National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers argued against 
Attorney General John Ashcroft.
Essentially, the PATRIOT Act 
allows warrants and wiretaps with 
less than probable cause. This new 
freedom of search and surveillance 
can be applied to criminal matters if 
they are disguised as national securi
ty matters. Therefore, the Act essen
tially negates the Fourth Amendment 
regarding search and seizure.
Instead of mere suspicion of ter
rorist activity, the government 
should be required to have evidence 
that explains this suspicion. This is a
step down from probable cause, as 
the evidence can often be minute 
and seemingly inconsequential. 
However, this requirement would 
add a degree of accountability to the 
FBI, and it would make it more diffi
cult to wiretap innocent citizens. 
And the FBI would still be able to tar
get potential threats with greater 
flexibility than before.
The government also needs to 
reevaluate the Acts provision on 
detainees. The attorney general can 
hold non-US citizens for seven days 
without charging them. After that, 
he must either file criminal charges 
or have them deported. However, if 
the attorney general files a technical 
immigration violation, or reasserts 
every six months that national secu
rity is at risk, he can detain these for
eign citizens indefinitely.
The idea of detaining people with
out charging them seems blatantly 
unconstitutional, even when dealing 
with non-US citizens, simply 
because there is no justification for
holding a person for more than a 
week without charging them. There 
should be a hard cutoff at seven 
days; if Ashcroft is still suspicious, he 
can always get a wiretap on them.
The main issue with the PATRIOT 
Act is its perpetuity. The wiretap and 
surveillance provisions run through 
2005; there are no other sunset 
clauses within the entire document. 
An act that so drastically alters per
sonal freedoms and civil liberties 
must be constantly reviewed, to 
make sure that its provisions are still 
necessary, and in keeping with the 
Constitution. Congress needs to 
return to this Act every year to 
update and reexamine it. Our legis
lature must make sure that such a 
powerful instrument is not misused. 
If the USA PATRIOT Act is left 
unchecked, it will likely grow and 
fester, eventually swallowing the Bill 
of Rights whole.

nothing. Saddam has no reason to 
abandon his traditional policy of 
cheat and retreat. For a country 
like Iraq, inspections are a joke, any
way. Saddam can block inspections 
in areas he chooses. Saddam can 
move his weapons to secret locations.

there? Inspections are also pointless 
because of the sheer size of the areas 
to inspect. Former inspector Scott 
Ritter estimated that Saddam had 
over 50 square kilometers of space 
under his presidential palaces alone, 
and that was four years ago!
Current inspections will be no bet
ter. Chief inspector Hans Blix is a con
cession to Saddam, who saw Scott 
Ritter, former head of the Unscom 
inspectorate, as too tough. Blix has 
105 days to submit a report on Iraqs 
weapons. He comes from the camp of 
the gullible European peaceniks and 
the last thing he wants to do is give 
the US a reason to take out Saddam. 
He is also there partly to satisfy the
French. Our spineless allies France, 
along with Russia, insisted on giving 
Saddam a second chance to this last  
chance. They accomplished this by 
requiring that a response to the likely 
Iraqi breach of SC 1441 be consid
ered by the UN, instead of simply 
allowing the US and Britain to imple
ment the only effective solution  
getting rid of Saddam.
Obviously the UN is utterly useless 
against Saddam. Even when the 
Iraqis admitted not complying with 
UN resolutions, nothing was done 
except the passage of another mean
ingless resolution. Such hypocrisy by 
the UN over enforcing their own res
olutions is a travesty and proves they 
have no credibility whatsoever in 
dealing with a ruthless and conniv
ing dictator like Saddam Hussein.
The UN is a mere tool that Saddam 
uses to keep himself in power, and 
has been exploited yet again. The UN 
is nothing but a diplomatic obstacle 
to the one body willing to uphold the 
UNs own ideals  the United States 
of America.

Swim teams easily defeat Spartans at home
Brad Kellog/Photo Staff
The mens swim team won in Saturdays meet, 165-115. Several swimmers earned 
personal best times, and junior Steve Choi earned a B-cut in the 100-yard freestyle.
SWIMMING, from page A10
big deal, were still having fun. 
Coach Belowich agrees that 
swimming is not just about doing 
well individually.
The girls like each others com
pany, he said. Swimming is very 
much a team sport, and we empha
size the team aspect. The guys also 
have camaraderie, they get along, 
and the men get along with the 
women, and being comfortable with 
the people you practice with is 
important.
Belowich has high hopes for both 
teams for the rest of the season.
Really what they have shown this 
season so far is that the girls tend to 
swim up to their level of competi
tion, said Belowich.
In each case, as the season pro
gresses, the womens team gets bet
ter and better. The rest of the season 
should be very much the same.
In the pre-meet meeting, said 
the coach, I said that we needed 
everyone to score, and everyone 
did. The undefeated men, Belowich 
said, are a dominant swim team.
It is a very, very, very good mens 
team. They havent lost a meet in 
two and a half seasons now. I think 
they are even a little bit better this 
year.
The teams have two separate 
meets coming up on December 6-7. 
There is the Miami University of 
Ohio Invitational, which is primarily 
a Division I meet. Six Tartan swim
mers have qualified for and will 
attend this invitational; the others 
will travel to. Grove City for another 
invitational.

Cross country runners 
compete in nationals
RUNNING, from page A10
The mens national race, run on an 
8k course, was won by the University 
of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, whose top 
four finishers placed in the top 30 
overall. First place went to senior 
Ryan Bak of Trinity College (Conn.). 
In the 215-runner field, Meurer fin
ished in 124th place with a time of 
26:37.0.
Nationals was a completely differ
ent ldnd of race than any other I had 
ever run before. When you take that 
many runners of the same level of
ability and throw them in one race it 
gets a little nutty, said Meurer, opti
mistic that he can return to nationals 
next year accompanied by the remain
der of the Carnegie Mellon team.
Mens cross-country will be return
ing most of its runners for next fall 
and Meurer believes that while the 
team fell short of some of its goals for 
the season, they can take their expe
rience and profit from it next year.

Matt Brun
CLASSIC, from page A10
On Saturday the team faced Grove 
City at Allegheny College in 
Meadville in its second game of the 
Classic, but fell short in its comeback 
effort. Junior guard Matt Kaitz 
poured in a team-high 31 points, but 
no one else on the team scored in 
double digits and the Tartans lost by 
a score of 87-70. But the score did 
not justify their effort.
With nine minutes remaining the 
Tartans overcame a 10-point deficit 
and tied the game at 56-56 against 
Grove City, which won 17 games last 
year. However, the Tartans could not 
maintain their level of play and Grove 
City pulled away with a 24-1 run.
I think we put in so much energy 
coming back to tie the game that 
once we did that we had somewhat of
a letdown as a team. And thats when 
they went on the run, Kaitz 
explained.
Overall the Tartans had difficulty 
making their shots. Their press 
defense, which is usually a strength 
that causes turnovers, was consistent
ly broken by Grove City, leading to a 
number of quick baskets. The team 
hopes to redeem itself next Saturday 
at the Carnegie Mellon Thanksgiving 
Invitational where it will take on Penn 
State-Altoona. The team won the 
championship last season and hopes 
to defend its title this year.
Although the Tartans did not come 
away from Allegheny with a win, they 
did leave with some positives.
Obviously you dont want to lose 
games, but the Grove City game is a 
game we can learn from, and it will 
help us in the future, said Wingen.

Making it a 
turkey and 
pigskin day
By the time most of you read this 
you will be on your way home for 
Thanksgiving break. Maybe you are 
passing time with my column on the 
Magic Bus, perhaps you are reading 
this the day before you go home, or 
(more than likely) you are looking 
over my work the day after you get 
back from the holiday. Either way we 
all know that Thanksgiving is close 
at hand, and, while the specific 
meaning of Thanksgiving differs 
from person to person, the basic 
premise of the holiday is very similar 
throughout the county. Thanksgiving 
is a time to be thankful. It is that one 
day of the year when you can forget 
you are on a diet, or that you are in 
the middle of the training season for 
whatever sport you play. It is the one 
day of the year when you can forget 
you are a horrible football analyst, or 
that your favorite football team is so 
far away from the playoffs they have 
already scheduled their January teetimes. It is that one day when you 
can forget your 15-page term paper, 
and, for that matter, you can forget 
CMU altogether. No matter your 
location, you are so far away from 
your schoolwork you dont even care 
about it. I love it.
To me thanksgiving is about the 
three Fs: Family, Food, and 
Football. There is nothing finer than 
sitting down with your family on 
Thanksgiving Day and watching 
football. The smell of the turkey is 
wafting through the house, you are 
pigging out on chips, or cheese and 
crackers. You are sitting in a more 
comfortable chair than CMU housing 
could ever dream of, and you are 
watching either the Dallas Cowboys 
or the Detroit Lions play football. 
Could it get better? I think not. You 
dont even need a beer; the moment 
is perfect just how it is. You can kick 
back with your parents, your sib
lings, and your estranged Uncle Ron, 
and simply enjoy the atmosphere.
For some reason the games just seem 
better on Thanksgiving. Yes, they 
always feature the Cowboys or the 
Lions, two teams who have been 
chronically bad these last few years, 
but no matter what the score is I 
always enjoy watching the game 
more on Thanksgiving.
Maybe it is the memories that get 
conjured up. Im sure any football 
fan can remember the great Dallas 
teams who used to beat up on people 
every Thanksgiving Day. John 
Madden would hand out his TurkeyLeg Award to whoever played the 
best game. One year the entire 
Dallas offensive line got it, and I 
doubt those turkey legs lasted more 
than five seconds with that group. 
Emmitt Smith was often a deserving 
recipient, as was the great Barry 
Sanders. Watching those two guys 
alone was enough; I didnt even need 
to see the other teams offense. 
Football made the holiday, it brought 
friends and family members togeth
er, and it still does.
This Thanksgiving we wont see 
the same stars as we have in years 
past. Barry Sanders is gone, and 
Emmitt is a shadow of his former 
self. Troy Aikman may be the com
mentator for one of the games, and 
Im sure Michael Irving will talk 
about them on The Best Damn Sports 
Show Period. As for the rest of those 
great Dallas teams, and not-as-bad 
Detroit teams, God only knows 
where they are. Well, God and what
ever Texas jail houses the former 
Cowboys.
But even without the old stars that 
made the games fun, Im sure 
Thanksgiving Day football will be 
worth watching. The Lions host the 
Patriots, and the Redskins head 
down to Dallas to square off against 
the Boys. Granted, glancing through 
the roster of those teams, it is hard to 
find a player who can compare with 
Thanksgiving Day heroes of old, but 
I dont think that will matter.
It could be me and ten guys I know 
playing out there on Thanksgiving 
and it wouldnt matter. The point 
isnt whom we get to see, it is that we 
get to see them play at all. We get to 
leave our jobs or our school, and we 
get to go home for a little while to 
watch football, hang out with the 
fam, and eat. It is the calm before 
the finals storm, the most relaxing 
day of the year, and regardless of 
what teams are playing, football is 
right there to make the day that 
much better. I hope all of you guys 
have a great holiday, and, more 
importantly, I hope the Redskins win 
because they have made me look like 
an idiot these last two weeks.

Cross country pair face nations best runners at nationals
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
Competing in the D-III cross country nation
al championships on Saturday was a first for 
senior Katie Aerni and junior Matt Meurer. The 
two Tartan runners attended the race held 
Saturday at St. Olaf College, in Minnesota, and 
each managed to finish in the middle of the 
215-runner fields. Aerni qualified for the race 
last week when she finished the regional 6k 
race in eighth place, while Meurer qualified by 
placing 16th in his regional race.
The national competition, run against expe
rienced opponents, was a first for both of 
Carnegie Mellons participants. Experience 
plays a big part at nationals, said mens cross
country coach Dario Donatelli, I thought they 
did well for their first time.
Williams College (Mass.) took first place in 
the womens race with four finishers in the top
ten. First place went to sophomore Missy 
Buttry of Wartburg College (Iowa), winner of 
three NCAA national titles in cross-country and 
track. Aerni finished 114th of 215, running the 
6k in 23:35.1.
The womens team this season finished well 
in spite of its youth. Fifteen of the teams 19 
runners are first-years or sophomores. 
Acclimation to the collegiate running atmos
phere will be key for the newcomers as the 
team completes next season minus Aerni.
Though pleased with the teams accomplish
ment this year, Aerni feels that the season 
could have ended better: It was a frustrating 
year. [Several runners] missed significant time 
due to injury and sickness, she said, They 
made up almost half of our team, but came 
together and pulled out good races, personal 
records, and incredible support for the rest of 
the team.

Womens basketball team hosts CMU Tip-Off Tournament
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon womens basketball 
team hosted its Tip-Off Tournament Classic 
Friday and Saturday. Participating alongside 
the Tartans were Point Park College, Calvin 
College (Mich.) and Denison College (Ohio). 
The women defeated Denison in the first round 
of the two-round tournament, but they could 
not hold on to a lead against Calvin in the final.
The Tartans (1-1) hope to improve on their 
14-11 record from last year, and have returned 
their starting five to the floor. Head coach 
Gerry Seidl hopes that the teams speed, with 
every member running a seven-minute or 
faster mile, can be used to their advantage this 
season.
The opening round of the tournament on 
Friday featured games between Point Park and 
Calvin, and Denison and CMU. Calvin, a peren
nial visitor to the NCAA tournament, defeated 
Point Park in the early game, pulling away in 
the first half and holding a 42-20 lead at halftime.
Point Park did not get closer until the last 
two minutes of the game when, down 75-48, 
they scored the final ten points of the game. 
Calvins thorough domination over Point Park 
was an indication of its preparation for the sea
son, and carried into the championship game 
Saturday.
The other opening round game on Friday 
had Denison facing Carnegie Mellon. Their 
first-round game started with a quick CMU 
13-8 lead nine minutes into the first half. 
While the team was making some errors, they 
were dominating rebounds in the defensive 
paint.
The Tartans carried an eight-point lead into 
halftime, 33-25. In the second half, the 
Tartans improved on offensive rebounds, cut 
their fouls, and started to open their lead. As 
the end approached, Denison increased its out
put to come within five but the remainder of 
the game was all Tartan free-throws en route to 
a 70-61 victory.
Following an early consolation game, in 
which Denison beat Point Park 66-47 on 31
percent field goal shooting by Point Park, 
Saturdays championship pitted the Knights of 
Calvin against the Tartans. Calvin guard Rita 
Ouwinga led all scorers in the first half with 11 
points, while CMU center Erin Brady and 
guard Michelle Sodini tallied ten points each.
Neither team dominated the half, though 
Calvin shot over 80 percent on free throws. 
That was balanced by their 12 turnovers in the 
half compared with the Tartans seven. The 
Tartans held ten-point leads several times in 
the half on Bradys three blocked shots and 
Sodinis four steals, but Carnegie Mellons lead 
was down to 38-32 at halftime.
Their tenuous six-point lead held for a third 
of the second half, but with seven minutes 
gone, the Knights mounted a 10-2 run to take 
a 53-49 lead. Though there were two more 
ties, the Tartans did not regain the lead for the 
remainder of the half. Carnegie Mellon tied the 
score for the last time at 60-60, but Calvin 
scored the next seven points to secure their 
win. Two clutch steals by junior guard Danyelle 
Sinclair closed Calvins lead to three, but with 
42 seconds remaining Bradv fouled out, and
the Knights won 7470.
Tournament MVP went to Calvin forward 
Emily Beard, who recorded ten points, four 
rebounds and three steals in the final. The only 
Tartan who made the All-Tournament team 
was Sinclair.
Seidl was pleased with the performance 
demonstrated by her team.
We just need to fine tune and then were 
right up there, she said. Were just going to 
get better. Seidl played nine of her ten veter
ans in the tournament this weekend  seven 
for ten minutes or more in Saturdays champi
onship.
Statistics portend a good season for 
Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans shot 75 percent 
on free throws and 31 percent from three-point 
territory. Though out-rebounded by Calvin, 
the Tartans kept parity in offensive rebounds, 
gathering 11. Sodini, Brady, and Sinclair con
tributed to the Tartans steal total, getting 16 
compared to Calvins eight.
Carnegie Mellon continues its non-confer
ence schedule tomorrow when they host the 
Thiel College Tomcats (0-2).
Men get 1-1 
split at West 
Penn Classic
by Jim Song
Junior Staffwriter
After last seasons mass-exodus of 
upperclassmen, the remaining play
ers on the mens basketball team had 
to regroup, and surprisingly played 
some of their best basketball of the 
season. This season the men contin
ued with that same level of intensity 
in their first game, defeating 
Washington & Jefferson by the score 
of 82-71 at the West Penn Classic this 
past Friday. But against Grove City in 
the in the second game of the Classic, 
the Tartans comeback effort fell 
short, and they lost by a score of 
87-70.
In the opening game, Carnegie 
Mellon was led by the strong play of 
first-year guard A.J. Straub and 
sophomore guard Jason Walters. 
Straub scored a team-high 18 points 
on 7-of-8 shooting and had 13 second-half points, including two threepointers, to help bring his team back 
from a two-point half-time deficit. A 
crowd favorite last year, Walters 
came off of pre-season knee surgery 
and added 15 points and five assists. 
While he was not quite at 100 percent 
yet, he was close to it. Coach Wingen 
projected Walters to be a very explo
sive player for us this year. Wingen 
also expects Ross Freeman, the cap
tain and only senior on the squad, to 
be more of a scoring threat this sea
son.
He is a guy who everyone in the 
program and the league highly 
respects for the way he plays and car
ries himself, said Wingen. Were 
expecting a big senior year out of 
Ross.
Carnegie Mellon grabbed the lead 
over Washington & Jefferson for the 
first time with 2:56 remaining in the 
first half with a Straub lay-up. The 
Tartans pulled ahead by three, but 
the Presidents had five points in the 
last minute of play to end the half 
with a 31-29 lead.
With 13:33 left in the second half 
and the score tied 44-44, the Tartans 
blew the game wide open with an 
11-1 run capped by a Walters bucket. 
Sophomore shooting guard Michael 
Divens, who had a strong pre-season, 
came off the bench to contribute 13 
points for the Tartans, going 5-for-8 
from the floor. Although the 
Presidents pulled to within six points 
with just under two minutes remain
ing, the Tartans never relinquished 
the lead. With that, Carnegie Mellon 
clinched its first victory of the season.

Against Tartans, Spartans swim upstream
Men (4-0) and women (3-1) leave Case Western Reserve in their wake with dominating performances
by Rebecca Cornelius
Assistant Sports Editor
An ample crowd gathered Saturday to watch 
the mens and womens swim teams defeat their 
opponents, the Case Western Reserve Spartans. 
The men won 165-115, and the women 163-138. 
The teams are now 4-0 and 3-1, respectively, in 
dual meets.
The collective team was in high spirits after the 
win, and coach David Belowich called for a few 
200-yard, eight-person exhibition relays between 
Tartan swimmers. Then the team gathered 
around the coach to chant in victory before hit
ting the pool for a cool-down.
Key swimmers for the men included junior 
Steve Clifford, sophomore Chris Pearson, junior 
Brian McCarthy, junior Steve Chiou, junior Brian 
Jucha, first-year Evan Powell, first-year Brian 
Hunter, and junior Sean Battis.
Clifford took first place in the 1000-yard 
freestyle, while McCarthy placed first in the 50- 
yard backstroke, and second in the 100-yard but
terfly.
Pearson, who has already made an A-cut for 
NCAA Nationals in the first meet of the year, took 
first place in two events: the 200-yard freestyle,
and the 100-yard freestyle. Chiou took first place 
in both the 50-yard and the 100-yard breast
stroke. His time in the 100-yard freestyle made a 
B-cut for Nationals.
Jucha took first in the 100-yard butterfly, and 
Hunter took first place in the 500-yard freestyle. 
Battis placed first in the 1-meter diving event, 
and second in the 3-meter event.
Powell earned his best college time in taking 
first in the 50-yard freestyle, and he placed first in 
the 100-yard backstroke also.
I was pretty happy with it, said Powell, I 
have been training harder than in high school, so 
I kind of expected it, but I was still really happy. 
The win in the backstroke was impressive 
because it is an off event for Powell.
The men also had a winning relay team: 
McCarthy, junior Brian Belowich, Jucha, and 
sophomore Bobby Coyler placed first in the 200- 
yard medley relay.
Top swimmers for the women were sophomore 
Emili Evans, junior Corey Ginsberg, junior Julie 
Tibor, sophomore Mindi Finnegan, and first-year 
Julie Pavia.
Evans placed first in two events: the 50-yard 
and the 100-yard backstroke. Ginsberg took first 
place in the 200-yard breaststroke, with a person
al best time, and second in the 100-yard breast
stroke. Tibor placed first in the 100-yard 
freestyle, with a personal best time, and second in 
the 50-yard freestyle.
In diving, Finnegan placed first in the 1-meter 
and the 3-meter events, and Pavia took a very 
close second in both events. Both divers have per
formed equally and consistently well in all of the 
meets this season, always competing for first 
place. Belowich is confident that both have a 
chance to go to nationals.
The women also won both relay events. First 
place in the 200-yard freestyle relay went to 
senior Mei-Lan Ho-Walker, Ginsberg, sophomore 
Jenn Wong, and Tibor.
In the 200-yard medley relay, a team of Evans, 
sophomore Samantha Monda, first-year Allison 
Theus, and sophomore Jessica Gibbons took first.
While both teams were excited about winning, 
they enjoyed the spirit of the meet.
We knew that Case was not going to be a diffi
cult meet, said Powell, but we decided to have a 
lot of fun and go for it anyhow. All teams do well 
under pressure. Its what teams can do when 
theyre not that makes the difference.
Were all doing this to have fun, said 
Finnegan, If we do well, great, but if not, its no

On Saturday, the womens swim team won both relay events and the diving events in theirWestern Reserve.

Living in sexile
Let your roommates Know your dorm room is off limits to them
Everyone knows the old hanger/sock on the door 
trick, one of the less subtle and more common ways 
to keep roommates out while involved in naked 
encounters in the room. But what do real students 
use when they want to sexile their roommates, to 
keep them out when there are less than wholesome 
activities going on inside?
One of the more creative solutions to the problem 
came from Robby Tucker, a junior business major at 
the University of Maryland. He and his roommate 
have a whiteboard with a circle drawn on it on their 
door. When the circle is colored in, it means, Do not 
enter. They have used the trick about 15 times, and 
no one has caught on, because there were other 
things written on the whiteboard as well to take 
attention away from the circle.
John Ramish has had problems with being sexiled 
by roommates both last year and this year. He has 
used different signals to know when to stay out of his 
room.
Basically, its the same story every time: I come
back to the room at night and find Hi John! with a 
check mark on the dry-erase board, or a bright postit note on the door, or something, and realize that 
the room is occupied,  said Ramish, a sophomore 
computer science major. So I do my homework else
where and try back later ... unless of course, my
"I thought she was 
asleep and I was too 
lazy to close the 
door."
backpack is in the room. In that case, I stand outside 
for a few minutes worrying about what to do and 
finally just knock and ask for it.
Another not so subtle signal was employed by 
Maria Shchensnyaks first-year roommate. She and 
her significant other chained the door shut 
from the inside so Shchensnyak, a junior in 
psychology, could not get in with her key. 
One particularly bad time, the roommate 
knew that Shchensnyak was sick with the 
flu, but proceeded to employ the chain trick 
anyway, and played music so loudly that 
she could not hear the knocks coming from 
the outside.
Some students have no tricks or agree
ments, or even a desire, to keep their room
mates out. One female student, who will 
not be named to protect the very, very 
guilty, once did it with the door open while 
her roommate was in the other room.
I thought she was asleep, said the 
guilty party of the incident, and I was too 
lazy to close the door. The same shameless 
girl and her significant other also do not 
have a signal for when they are getting 
down at his place.
We just wait until [his roommate] is 
asleep, she said, and then we are very 
quiet.

The Tartan ranked in the top 16 percent in the Associated Collegiate 
Presss national contest. Out of 300 college newspapers that entered the 
contest, The Tartan was given 970 points out of a maximum 1000, and 
received a First-Class certificate. Each paper was judged on four major top
ics: news values and sources, news writing and editing, headlines and 
make-up, and department pages and special features. The Tartan received 
special recognition for overall coverage and good story organization. 
Judges suggested the newspaper include more articles on the schools his
tory and that it should trim the length of its editorials.

The C-Book, CMUs student telephone directory, lacked enough adver
tising revenue to cover its publication costs. Because of this, Jonathan 
Dwark, chairman of the student directory, asked the University to subsidize 
its publication. Richard Van Horn, vice-president for business affairs, 
turned down his request. Van Horn felt that subsidizing Alpha Phi Omega, 
the organization that publishes the C-Book, would lead us into problems. 
He explained that student and University activities are and should remain 
separate and that if the University decided to subsidize APhiO, other organ
izations would also desire subsidies.

CMUs Student Dormitory Council voted in favor of a resolution affecting 
how much each CMU student was required to pay for damage to common 
areas in campus housing. SDC approved a resolution that said that if com
mon area damages could not be assessed to one person, the costs would be 
distributed among all the residents of the building. Previously, if any com
mon areas in University housing were damaged, the residents of the floor 
would be charged.

A small fire in Cyert Hall shut down the Andrew network for over three 
hours, temporarily backing up incoming email and disabling student 
Andrew accounts. At approximately 10:30 am a device unrelated to the 
network caught fire in the building. The alarm system was activated and 
automatically shut off the electricity, disrupting the Andrew file servers 
and networking and mail services. The fire was quickly put out and 
Computing Services was able to restore most services by 2 pm. No perma
nent damages or injuries were reported, but there were reports that the fire 
was actually caused by a hot dog that exploded in a microwave.

In a survey done by The Tartan, 99 percent of undergraduates rated the 
quality of President Jared Cohons interaction with the student body to be 
mediocre or worse. In the survey, the undergraduate students displayed an 
overwhelming lack of knowledge about the Presidents duties. Many stu
dents said that, though Cohon was busy with administrative and fundrais
ing duties, he should try to increase his campus interaction. Several stu
dent groups, such as the Society of Women Engineers and the Womens 
Center, felt that President Cohon should use his position as University 
President to raise campus awareness of student organizations.

Nostalgia: the food, not the holiday
Recipes that remind us of home, especially when were not there
As Thanksgiving and the winter holidays 
approach, warm and fuzzy supermarket com
mercials set out to remind us of the large part 
that food plays in our lives, the power it has to 
conjure memories of family and good times. But 
often, its not the seasonal pies and cakes of 
aunts, uncles, and grandparents that remind us 
most of home, not the turkey and stuffing that 
appear on the dining room table only once a 
year. Its the everyday foods  the toast and 
cocoa you ate every morning before elementary 
school, the brownie batter licked from mixing 
spoons, even the Frankenberry cereal that your 
sister ate bowls upon bowls of  that are the 
most memorable and meaningful.
Of course, no two families share the same his
tories or the same passed-down foods, but here 
are three of my favorites. They wont stir up the 
same memories for you as they do for me, but 
theyre comfort foods nonetheless, and easy to 
prepare. Here Ive provided measurements, but 
like the best family recipes, these are play-it-byear melanges of pinches and dashes of this and 
that, very open to substitution and creative play. 
No matter the changes you choose to make, 
however, these dishes always turn out tasting 
fantastic, tasting like home.
FRANKS BANANA PANCAKES
My Puerto Rican father is a wonderful chef; 
Im especially fond of anything he makes with 
sticky rice or fried bananas. I remember him 
cooking these pancakes on summer vacation 
mornings, letting me help beat the eggs and 
mash the bananas  my favorite part. This is an 
extremely simple recipe, one of the first I 
learned to make by myself, and the ingredients 
might be ones you already have on hand. You 
can make these pancakes with just about any 
fruit, and they go very well with a little bit of 
butter and syrup drizzled over them.
3 eggs
1 tsp. cinnamon
1 tsp. vanilla 
3 Tbsp. sugar 
3 very ripe bananas 
1/2 c. flour
Beat the eggs, and to them, add the cinna
mon, vanilla, and sugar. In a separate bowl, 
mash the bananas  you can make them very
smooth or leave them a little chunky depending 
on how you like the texture  and fold them 
into the egg mixture. Stir in the flour. 
Meanwhile, heat a skillet on the stovetop, and 
coat it lightly with a tiny bit of butter or oil to 
prevent the pancakes from sticking. Drop the 
batter onto the skillet  Dad recommends 
keeping them fairly small, so theyll be easy to 
flip - and fry them on one side until the tops are 
bubbly and the edges seem to separate from the 
pan. With a spatula, flip the pancakes, and fin
ish cooking until the underside is golden.
EDNAS PIEROGIES
Some of my friends here are surprised to find 
out that I knew what pierogies were before I 
came to Pittsburgh. My grandma has been mak
ing them for as long as I can remember, since 
well before I was born; theyre her signature 
dish and a family favorite. Truthfully, I never 
used to like them much  the flavors were 
much too bold for my young palate to handle  
but in recent years, Ive developed a taste for 
them. In case youre wary of sauerkraut, 
though, you can do what.Grandma used to do 
for me. She would make a large batch of piero
gies for the grown-ups, but save a bit of the 
plain dough. Together, we would roll the left
over dough into little fouror five-inch strips, 
and she would boil them for me to enjoy, sans 
sauerkraut, with just a little bit of butter and 
salt.
For the filling:
2 large onions, chopped 
1 c. oil
1 bag of sauerkraut 
Pepper to taste
8 oz. cottage cheese
For the dough:
2 c. flour
1 large egg 
Pinch of salt
Heat the oil in a skillet, then add the onions. 
Fry them until theyre golden-brown and set 
them aside. Meanwhile, boil the sauerkraut for 
five minutes, just to tenderize it. Let it cool com
pletely, and strain the excess liquids  it helps 
to give it a squeeze. Next, in a large frying pan, 
combine the sauerkraut and about a third of the 
onion mixture and add pepper to taste. Fry it
over low heat for about 10 minutes, turn off the 
heat, and stir in the cottage cheese.
While the filling is cooling, combine the flour, 
egg, and salt for the dough. You might need to 
add a little bit of water to bring it to a workable, 
Play-Doh consistency. With a large rolling pin, 
roll the dough onto a floured surface. Next, 
using a round cookie cutter or the rim of a large 
drinking glass, cut circles. Drop a tablespoonful 
of filling into the center of each dough circle, 
fold them in half, and tightly pinch the edges 
closed.
When youre ready to eat, drop the sealed 
pierogies into salted, boiling water, and simmer 
them for no more than 10 minutes. Keep an eye 
on them to make sure they dont explode. Drain 
them well. You can eat them with just a bit of 
butter and salt, or, if you like, spoon the 
reserved onion mixture on top before serving.
DIANES TUNA CASSEROLE
Without fail, this is the dinner that my Mom 
would serve every Ash Wednesday and every 
Friday during Lent. I always ate at least one gen
erous, warm, and creamy helping straight from 
the oven, but I enjoyed it even more as a left
over, pulled cold from the fridge the next day, or 
shared as a late-night snack with my mom. To 
me, her tuna casserole is the epitome of comfort 
food, and I still make special requests for it year 
round, long after the Easter season has ended.
8 oz. elbow macaroni or shells
2 large cans of tuna, drained
2 cans of condensed mushroom soup 
1 small can of peas, drained 
1/2 c. milk
Boil the pasta for about seven minutes; it 
should still be a little firm at this point, since it 
will continue cooking in the oven. To the welldrained pasta, add the tuna, mushroom soup, 
and peas. If you like your casserole on the loose 
and creamy side  like we do  add 1/2 cup of 
milk, as well. Pour the mixture into a 13x9 glass 
baking dish, and cover it with breadcrumbs or 
crushed potato chips. Bake it in a 350 oven for 
35 to 40 minutes, just until it bubbles.

Table for one:
You can enjoy Thanksgiving without the family
Your humble critic has a confession to make: he is a hopeless mamas boy. Not 
once has he been away from hearth and home during the holidays, for any reason. 
Easter, Christmas, Thanksgiving  each occasion finds him, predictably, in his 
mothers kitchen or at her table enjoying the company of food and fami
ly. Somewhere along the line, there may have been an Arbor Day in 
there when he was the Pascocello in absentia, but he doubts it. Just 
the thought of it makes him shudder.
consisting of steaks, roasts, and fish. But lets talk turkey; in this department you 
have two choices: the dinner buffet and the traditional gobbler dinner. The buffet 
is merely an exaggerated expression of the dinner  for around $15 you can 
indulge in mounds of mashed potatoes, gallons of cranberry sauce, and enough 
white meat to fill a flat-bed truck. For qualitys sake, however, go with the dinner. 
(Though if you prefer becoming the stuffed turkey rather than our feathered 
friend this year, help yourself.)
So whats the point of this little personal dispensation? Well, the 
holidays  especially one like Thanksgiving, a day based upon 
indulgence in food and guests  are meant to be enjoyed with 
those you love. But, alas, not all of us can be so fortunate.
There are certain demands levied on us by work, school, or 
fate that preclude our jetting home in time for the 
turkeys carving. But the loner has an alternative in the 
form of local restaurants holiday offerings. These spots 
might not always know you by name, but the good ones 
will take a stab at treating you like family.
Enter Durantis Restaurant, that loose-brick arm of 
Park Plaza on South Craig Street you may have con
sidered more of a cafeteria than a solid eatery. This 
place is old, and its not just the clientele. The restau
rant has passed through three generations of 
Durantis and its interior doesnt mind betraying that 
sense of age  the place has the appearance of an 
Officers Club near closing time, circa 1949. One of 
the current mangers, however, Theodora Duranti, 
is disarmingly cheerful and passionate about her 
food and restaurant in a way that is utterly child
like in description. And why not? She did grow 
up here, as did several members of her house
hold, the whole lot residing in the restaurants 
private quarters until time and experience 
beckoned them to the cavernous first-floor 
lobby and Durantis steerage. The result, one 
could offer, is a true family atmosphere.
If you want to attend to your inner glut
ton, youd be hard-pressed to find a better 
opportunity than Thanksgiving. The hol
iday seems custom-tailored to excess.
Fortunately, Durantis is here to oblige.
The restaurant offers a Thanksgiving 
menu special (or is it a special menu?)
Elizabeth Levin/Junior Staff
The dinner itself consists of stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes, broccoli, and 
turkey. Dark meat looks to be the default condition for this meal, so if you 
enjoy breast over leg or thigh, the white meat plate (about one dollar more) 
is encouraged. Everything about this dinner with regard to Thanksgiving is 
pretty standard, which is to say good. There are a couple of regrettable 
things about it, however. The mashed potatoes taste slightly stock; they 
have that ultra-whipped feel that screams box recipe rather than elbow 
grease. The broccoli is a tad undercooked just ever so slightly  and 
could have stood another turn in the steamer. But, seeing as how a 
new generation of diners enjoy their vegetables crisp and vibrant 
rather than limp and saturated, you could consider this gaffe a 
shortcoming or a sign of the Zeitgeist, depending on the way you 
look at it. Salad and rolls come with the meal and while the for
mer is nothing special, the rolls are especially tasty. Rolls, 
breads, and desserts, says the menu, are all homemade.
Speaking of desserts, the pumpkin pie this reviewer ordered 
(this is a Thanksgiving dinner, after ail) was sweet and sug
ary. The dollop of whipped cream on top (no ice cream?) 
was a nice touch as well. Even the wine list provided a few 
gems. Current fashion would seek to pair a turkey dinner 
with some kind of fruity white, perhaps a mature 
Chardonnay. But the Walnut Crest Cabernet Savignon 
this reviewer chose was a welcome departure from 
stuffy tradition, releasing bold flavors in the dish and 
exuding an splendid, unmistakable chewiness.
Thanksgiving really is a difficult time to be away 
from home. But, if youre going to have a go at it, you 
might as well feed yourself right. So if the story of 
this holiday finds you sans family  lets call it, 
How to Eat Alone, with apologies to Jonathon 
Franzen  heres hoping your Turkey Day has 
a happy ending.

Acclaimed filmmaker Saunders
Filmmaker Scott Saunders to speak in latest Adamson Visiting Writers seriesReflections on Work
Contemporary Arts in Society lecture 
explores musical theater process
One of the endless versions of the chicken-or-the-egg 
question got even more complicated at Thursdays Center for 
Arts in Society lecture, Sharing the Spodight: Collaboration 
in Musical Theater. Instead of just asking, What comes 
first: the music or the lyrics? the panelists compounded the 
dilemma by asking who writes what.
Matthew Heap and Christopher Ruth, junior composition 
majors who are working on their fourth musical together, 
have tried various ways of writing the music and the lyrics. 
In their first show, based on Shakespeares The Tempest, 
they each composed some of the songs. They opted not to use 
that technique in their next show, Dies Irae; the stylistic 
differences in the music were too glaring.
I tend towards more angular, post-modernism [than 
Ruth], Heap said.
Now they each compose a version of every song with their 
own lyrics, and come together to merge the best of each of 
their ideas. Musicologist Jessica Sternfeld, their faculty advi
sor, said that this working method is unprecedented in the 
history of musical theater. There is a basis for some consis
tency, however, as the two composers agree on simple chord 
progression to use throughout the musical.
We always stick with one kernel, said Ruth.
The panel also included Jaime McCarthy, a junior major
ing in Drama and English, who wrote the text to Peter and 
Maimie, Heap and Ruths most recent musical. Unlike many 
playwrights who are resistant to changing their work and 
protecting its integrity, McCarthy said the only way to see 
the full potential of ones work is to give it up to other people.
There were things that I wouldve never thought to go 
into that were really sensational, she said.
Although McCarthy doesnt read music, she felt she still 
brought an important perspective to the group. Im every 
audience, she said. Im not going to sit and analyze the 
music.
McCarthy will again be working with Heap and Ruth for 
their next musical, currently entitled West Mifflin Home for 
the Aged. Completely different from their previous work, it 
is a comedy that takes place in a retirement home. The score 
is jazzy and reminiscent of Fred Astaire, and includes songs 
such as the Viagra Tango and I Want to Grow Old with 
You.
The format and the theme of the show make it a likely con
tender for audiences beyond Carnegie Mellon. Unlike The 
Maimie Bird from Peter and Maimie, for example, the 
songs from the comedy will make sense performed without 
the entire play.
This show is [our] most universally applicable show 
because its a romantic comedy, said McCarthy.
The comedy is scheduled to open in April.
For writers who aspire to be poets, novelists, and essayists, 
the Adamson Visiting Writers Series is a source of inspira
tion, as well as an opportunity to touch base with the big
wigs of the writing world. But next Monday, Baker Hall will 
host an interesting change of pace with filmmaker Scott 
Saunders.
Students interested in screenwriting, and those students 
outside the English Department who study acting, directing, 
or filmmaking, should take notice that Saunders has direct
ed, co-written, and co-produced two feature films and over 
20 shorts. He is likely one of the most experienced filmmak
ers to visit the campus in years  and also one of the most 
lauded.
His second feature, The Headhunters Sister, won the 
Grand Jury Prize at the Florida Film Festival, a Jury Prize at 
the Seattle International Film Festival, a Special Jury Prize 
at the Bangkok International Film Festival, and the Audience 
Award at the Long Island Film Festival. Variety Magazine 
recently named Saunders one of the ten digital video direc
tors to watch, and the Independent Spirit Awards, the 
Academy Awards of independent filmmaking, awarded him 
the Someone to Watch Award.
Other films include his first feature, The Lost Words, which 
won the Silver Medal at Portugals International Film 
Festival, as well as the First Feature Award at the Suffolk 
Film Festival, and his most recent short film, Welcome to 
Willieworld, which is still in post-production. He is also in 
pre-production on a new feature called The Technical Writer, 
which he co-wrote and will direct in the fall.
Of special interest is Saunderss experimentation with 
rudimentary filming techniques, which began shooting Hi-8 
film, playing the edited film on a television, and pointing a 
camera at the screen. By experimenting in a lab with this 
process, Saunders found a way to make films cheaply while 
maintaining the high-quality look that viewers expect. 
Saunders, however, has been reluctant to describe the 
process. Saunders admits that there is a pure formal beau
ty about film that you cannot create in video. Id like to make 
a film that has a slower visual beauty, and I dont think that 
can work in video. Still, I think that as video technology gets 
better, the line between film and video will vanish. Such 
views as these have put Saunders at the forefront of modem 
filmmakers, as well as made him a hot topic within the film 
community.
Saunderss feature, The Headhunters Sister, will air on the 
Independent Film Channel later this year.

Capezzutis lint angels
Who needs Snuggles when you have angels looking over your delicates?Tiny-scale nativity
Carnegie Museum of Arts annual Neapolitan Presepio
The day after Thanksgiving, 
the Carnegie Museum will 
open its annual presepio exhib
it, a gigantic nativity scene that 
has been a Pittsburgh holiday 
tradition since 1957.
The exquisite, hand-carved 
figurines date back as far as 
1700. They are arranged every 
year by assistant curator 
Elizabeth Agro, who worked at 
New Yorks Metropolitan 
Museum of Art prior to coming 
to the Carnegie.
The Metropolitan has its 
own presepio every year, as 
well, she says. I was very 
excited when I came here and 
was told that it was going to be 
part of my job.
Agro puts a lot of effort into 
making the scene vivid and 
lifelike, focusing on the rela
tionships between the charac
ters. Each figure has its own 
role and imagined backstory.

When emptying your lint trap before pushing 
the start button to your heavy duty Maytag 
dryer, you never consider what is going to hap
pen to the lint once it goes in the trash can. 
Perhaps a mystical being with wings comes 
along and scoops the lint into its arms and car
ries it off into the big Laundromat in the sky 
where the lint can tumble-dry through eternity. 
Well, the mystical being doesnt have wings, 
but she does have a greater purpose for dis
carded, dander-ridden pieces of colorful fluff. 
Local artist Cheryl Capezutti displayed her 
work, otherwise known as lint art, at 
Shadysides Duds N Suds this past Saturday. 
The theme of her exhibit: Angels in the 
Laundromat.
Walking into the laundromat, it wasnt sur
prising to see people washing and drying their 
clothes, occasionally exchanging pleasantries 
as they maneuvered around each other with 
armloads of their personal laundry. But in 
place of clothing on the orange counters 
labeled These tables are for folding clothes 
only, there were clumps of lint molded to form 
people-like shapes.
The figurines were intriguing, but also some
what unsettling, reminiscent of the claymation 
in Tools Sober video. The faceless, anatomi
cally incorrect figures were arranged in differ
ent positions, each with a label underneath 
stating whose lint was used to make the figure.
Im about nine years into the process, said 
Capezutti at her Duds N Suds exhibition over 
the laundromat stereo with various artists 
singing about angels. I started [making lint 
figures] in graduate school because I was in a 
sculpture studio. I started making them for my 
friends, who then told their friends, who then 
told their friends. Then I started getting bags of 
lint in the mail.
At first, the angels hanging up on the ceiling 
of the laundromat arent noticeable. Who 
would think to look up expecting to see angels 
looming over his or her shoulder while folding 
their delicates and cotton-blends?
But once you see one, you see another, and 
another, said Capezutti amidst the slowlygrowing crowd of people. The onlookers at the 
event seemed to outnumber the people actual
ly there to wash their clothing.
Nicolette Montgomery, a friend of Capezutti 
and fellow lint artist, proctored a lint-sculpting 
session in the laundromat. She said that on 
average, a small lint figure takes about 15 min
utes to make. The only supplies needed are lint, 
wallpaper glue, and a pair of nimble-fingered 
hands.
Capezutti doesnt rush through her lint guys, 
the name her figures are known by. She takes
time to reflect on the posterity of the lint as 
well as the original owner of the lint. Among 
the multi-layers of lint and animal/human hair, 
also visible are prints of Capezzuits fingers, 
used to mold, mash, probe, and push the lint 
into one of the hundred suspended angels soar
ing through the fluorescent lighting of the 
laundromat.
Theyre almost like little snowflakes with 
personality, said T.C. Brown, office employee, 
actor at City Theatre, and friend of Capezuttis, 
after he had finished a live performance in the 
laundromat called Laundry Conversations, a 
real-time reenactment of the laundry cycle.
Capezutti has met many people through 
making lint guys. She documents almost every 
figure that she makes, the number currently 
standing around 530 pieces. She receives lint 
donations from all over Pennsylvania, often 
from students at various Pennsylvania colleges 
and universities. Sometimes people decide to 
donate not only their lint, but otherwise regu
larly discarded material that he or she would 
like to have memorexed in some form.
Once, a man named Tony SanFillipo donated 
hair from his hairbrush to Capezutti in hopes 
that she could make a figure out of it. She 
found this task quite difficult, since hair is not 
as malleable a substance as lint is. She ended 
up having to use a lint base in the end. 
Capezzuti sent the completed figure back to its 
owner, who sent her a letter expressing his 
gratitude. She then decided that she would 
never accept anything other than lint to make 
sculptures.
Capezutti sends all her lint guys back to their 
owners free of charge. She often corresponds 
with many of them, and some appeared at the 
Duds N Suds opening exclaiming, There she 
is, as they ushered their children through the 
line of people forming to make lint sculptures 
of their own.
In her artist's statement Capezutti says that 
she is aware that her work is unique and dan
gerously close to laughable. This reporter 
walked into Suds N Duds with more than a 
notion of skepticism for Capezuttis Lint 
Project, the official title of collection of lint 
work. However, one cant help but admire the 
time that one person can put into a project that 
is not only fulfilling individually, but also to 
people around her.
I make sculptures out of dryer lint, said 
Capezutti. I am significantly more interested 
in making work that forces people to expand 
their preconceived boundaries for art or dis
miss it than in making work that very clearly 
falls into an existing category.
NlHORM pu.MBV, 055B5atVa sBMM.d nWBaO
My husband calls it playing with 
dolls, she laughs. I have a ball with it, 
every year.
There are 117 figures total in the prese
pio  merchants and beggars, shepherds 
and fishermen, and of course the holy 
family. The figures were carved over a 
period of years, some of them dating 
back as far as 1700. The backdrops used 
in the exhibit are more recent, having 
been commissioned by the figurines for
mer owner in the 1940s.
The museum acquired the rare fig
urines from an Italian descendant of a 
presepio stagemaker who had been col
lecting them for years. Upon hearing that 
the man was thinking of selling, the 
museum immediately contacted him, and 
got their pick of the fine collection, which 
included hundreds of miniature people 
and animals. The rest of the mans collec
tion was eventually purchased by the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York 
City.
Presepios were all the rage among 18th 
century Italian aristocracy.
It was a case of each family trying to 
outdo the other, says Agro. It wasnt 
about religion, it was about ostentation 
and display and conspicuous consump
tion, everyone trying trying to outdo 
their friends.
It was a point of pride to have as many 
figures as you could, richly clothed and 
imaginatively carved. Every year around 
Christmas time, each family would throw 
a party, to showcase the family presepio 
and how much had been added from the 
year before. Legend has it that the king 
worked alongside the craftsmen carving 
the figures, and the queen tore up last 
years dresses to make clothes for the 
miniature citizens.
The appeal of the display continues 
after centuries. We have a lot of people 
coming back every year, says Agro. 
People remember coming as children, 
and they bring their children. Its really a 
beautiful holiday tradition.

The Vines in concert
Pittsburgh audience only wants to hear the hit singles
Last Wednesday night, MTV2s Handpicked 
tour landed in Pittsburgh, and a crowd of Hot 
Topic customers and a few assorted music fans 
gathered at M in the Strip District to watch the 
Vines perform.
Though their debut album Highly Evolved 
earned much video and radio play, the Vines 
disappointed many concertgoers, who expected 
the live performance to be a simple extension of 
the angry and jagged singles Outtathaway! 
and Get Free. In fact, the bands artistry and 
almost Badfinger-like pop sensibilities  beau
tifully showcased on Highly Evolved  missed 
the mark with the edgy throng at M.
Craig Nicholls (vocals/guitar), Patrick 
Matthews (bass/vocals), and David Oliffe 
(drums) joined forces in the late 1990s in their 
native Sydney, Australia, where they attended 
high school together and worked at the neigh
borhood McDonalds. Borrowing their name 
from Nichollss fathers 60s pop outfit, the 
Vynes, the boys regularly played friends parties 
and other small local events. Grunge covers 
were a large part of their 
early set lists, but it was 
their energetic original 
number, Factory, that 
caught the eye of execu
tives at Capitol Records, 
home of Radiohead and 
the Beatles. The Vines 
quickly made a splash in 
the UK, and, after exten
sive touring and a 
Roman Polanski-directed video for Get Free, 
caught US airplay in
The Vines, performing
... , . ,. , esque fashion.The Vines wrinkled ____2________
flannels and moody 
scowls leave them vulnerable to superficial 
Nirvana comparisons, but their sound is more 
diverse than their singles plunging guitar riffs 
and bitter lyrics suggest. Complete with har
monic background vocals, tracks like Autumn 
Shade and Country Yard are dreamy, intro
spective, and richly produced, more along the 
lines of early Radiohead than late power-punk 
or grunge. On the other end of the spectrum are 
punchy, energetic, even optimistic songs like 
Sunshinin, Aint No Room, and Factory, 
that bear likenesses to Blurs potboilers. Still 
other tracks  the tritely named Mary Jane in 
particular  are psychedelic masterpieces. Its 
no wonder that Wednesdays MTV-fed concert 
crowd had misguided expectations.
The Vines started out their set with the pre
approved Get Free, but by the time they pro
gressed to more delicate numbers like 
Homesick, a hauntingly melodic and wistful
piece, the mosh pit was growing visibly restless. 
Though they briefly won back crowd favor with 
desirably frenzied Outtathaway!, the Highly 
Evolved title track, and a dim and sardonic cover 
of Outkasts Ms. Jackson, the band seemed to 
waste their eclectic repertoire on a group only 
familiar with their sound-alike singles.
Though the audience called for an encore  
a three-song set that included a vigorous, new 
non-album track  their cries seemed half
hearted and obligatory; they started shuffling 
out of the building before a shirtless Nicholls 
officially ended the show with a characteristi
cally irritable tossing of his mic stand.
The unappreciative audience response, how
ever, was not the shows only weakness. Though 
their set list successfully demonstrated their 
range, the apparently heavily intoxicated Vines 
frequently stumbled through chord changes and 
drumbeats, and on the common occasion of for
gotten lyrics, Nicholls resorted to random 
screaming and feedback to disguise his gaffes. 
The boys invariably spent the seconds-long gaps 
between songs 
reaching for beer 
bottles and ciga
rettes. The fumbling 
cast a negative and 
foreboding pallor 
over the otherwise 
passionate and 
earnest perform
ance.
The Vines are 
often unfairly
Lindsey Arroyo/Copy Staff clumped together
Kl d mrNKud44r e.uC6mdef 7Kmv EEDide(0f assemblies like the
______________________ White Stripes and
the one-dimensional 
Hives, a band against whom they are often, and 
falsely, accused of carrying a grudge. Without a 
doubt, however, their talent is much more 
developed and unique than that of their con
temporaries, and their future looks promising. 
The Vines plan to release a new, mid-fi LP in 
2003. Barring an early burnout, their musicality 
should usher in an equally sophisticated sopho
more project, a fact recognized by the bands 
bassist.
It always has felt like if we push it too hard, it 
will just blow up, said Matthews in a Billboard 
magazine interview earlier this year. As long as 
the band moves forward with their cool and 
energetic style, however, lackluster live per
formances wont stop the band from evolving 
even more.

Farewell Euclid
Interview with local math rock band
Can saying farewell mean saying hello 
to a whole new world? For the femalefronted Pittsburgh band Farewell Euclid, 
one can only hope. As the one-year mark 
approaches, Josh Beyer (bass), Nick 
Haberman (drums), Julie Nowak 
(vocals), and Mike Yamamoto (guitar) 
look forward to the release of their self
titled demo CD.
Although the beginning steps were 
rocky, Farewell Euclid started off on the 
right foot.
Im the only remaining member of 
the original lineup. When the band was 
first started I was only 16 and I had no 
way to get to practices, which were in the 
South Side, so I asked Mike to join, 
because he was 18 and had a car, stated 
Beyer. Eventually things happened with 
the other guitarist, drummer, and singer 
and they all ended up leaving, which is 
when Nick joined. We practiced as that 
for maybe six or seven months while try
ing out a slew of different singers. The 
funny thing is I knew Julie through all of 
this, but I never thought to ask her to try 
out. Needless to say, she did, and it 
worked great.
After the lineup adjustments, Farewell 
Euclid focused their energy mainly on 
practices and local shows, and has 
recently set off to +/- Studios to record 
with the aid of Andy Wright and Jason 
Jouver (Creta Bourzia vocalist). The 
three-song demo will include Ten, 
Make or Break, and Four Minutes.
They plan to share, or sell for a mini
mal price, the demo with fans, bands, 
and small record labels as an attempt to 
get their name out into the music world. 
The band is still unsure of how they 
would like to release the demo.
The first release of it would just be 
the three songs we recorded. There are 
talks of possibly putting our three songs 
on a split with Sadaharu, which would 
give people more songs for their money, 
and cut down on the number of CDs that 
end up lost in boxes under beds, said 
Haberman.
As for the future of the band, anything 
is possible.
[Our plans are] the same as any other 
band: play shows, record when we get 
enough quality songs for a CD, repeat 
steps one and two as necessary, conquer 
the world, said Haberman.
Aside from recordings, Farewell 
Euclids live shows are full of passion, 
excitement, and vigor.
I once forgot I was playing a concert 
and thought I was in a hockey game and 
checked two people in the audience, and 
I broke Nicks bass drum once, 
Yamamoto said.
Farewell Euclid draws their inspira
tions and sound from a plethora of out
lets. Nowak stated, Mike likes Incubus! 
And the rest of us are into a lot of differ
ent things from Denali to Saetia to 
Coheed and Cambria.
Right now Ive been listening to a 
band we are good friends with from Fort 
Wayne, Indiana, called Step Softly 
Ghost. Aside from music, I just bought a 
stamp-making kit the other day. Ive 
been having fun with that, added Beyer.
Although they have not pinpointed an 
exact sound or genre to which they want 
to belong, Farewell Euclid have a nice 
mathy rock n roll feel, with a little indie 
mixed in. Keep an eye out for their demo 
coming soon to a Farewell Euclid show 
near you.

TH6T6RGame of Love and Chance
The Drama schools latest mainstage production
Welcome to a place where love is a game, the 
game is about power, and to gain love is to gain 
power. The place is Paris in 1730 and the play is 
Marivauxs Game of Love and Chance.
Sylvia, played by Brennan Gay Hesser, is a 
daughter of privilege who is wholly distrustful of 
what happiness marriage can bring. Her maid 
Lisette (Kelly Goode, Drama senior), believes that 
marriage to the right man is completely possible 
and in fact within her mistresss reach: Sylvias 
father Monsieur Orgon (Sam George, Drama sen
ior), has arranged for her to marry a young man 
named Dorante (Danny Bernardy, Drama senior), 
who has a reputation for being handsome and 
kind. He is set to arrive that day with his valet.
Hearing this, Sylvia decides to disguise herself 
as her maid and have Lisette fill her role, to better 
observe her suitor without his knowing who she 
is. Meanwhile, Dorante has decided to do the very 
same thing, and acts as if he is valet to his own 
valet, Harlequin. Thrilled with the idea of making 
the search for love a game, Sylvia is excited to see 
if her potential husband fits her expectations. 
Instead she is drawn to the valet, as he is to her.
At some point in the play every character gets a 
laugh, though Demond Robertson as Harlequin
gets the most. His jaunty walk, comically exagger
ated facial expressions, and flirtation with Lisette 
make him dynamic. Goode is a charming Lisette, 
whose humor is mostly physical as well, running 
away from Robertson and sitting on him when she 
feels like it. As masters of the house, George and 
his stage-son Mario (Aaron Staton, Drama 
Junior), encourage the two sets of potential lovers 
to get to know each other, even exclaiming, 
Youre to be bosom buddies! much to the amuse
ment of the audience.
Bernardy did a fine job as Dorante, bringing 
steadiness and genuine feeling to his every pros
tration and plea for the love of Sylvia, whom he 
thinks is Lisette, Sylvias maid.
Hesser conveys clearly the anger and frustra
tion that her character often feels, speaking quick
ly and indignantly with a biting tone at times, but 
never losing her good enunciation. She establish
es her character early on, when arguing with her 
maid in the first scene, and delivers many biting 
instructions such as, Please respect me without 
saying it because it stinks of pretext, throughout.
The set, which resembles a conservatory or gar
den, is organic in the way of stone and wood. A 
large tree has a branch suspended over the stage.
The tree is not complete, but what is there is textured and interesting, giving the suggestion of a 
full tree. The garden, unobtrusive and functional, 
has enough levels and pillars to accommodate 
some interesting blocking and action. In contrast, 
the costumes were appropriately luxurious for the 
upper-class characters, and especially vivid and 
colorful for the two women, who looked as if they 
were garbed in robes of sherbet.
Interestingly, as much as the play deals with the 
ideas of separation between the classes, the cos
tumes for the maid and the valet are only slightly 
less elaborate than those of their masters. When 
Sylvia and Lisette first enter, their banter and 
arguing seemed to suggest that they were friends, 
or sisters, or cousins, rather than maid and mis
tress. Later, when Sylvia is angry with her, she 
uses their different standings as leverage in her 
argument, but mostly the line is more blurred 
than one would expect. The characters acknowl
edge how servants are allowed to take more liber
ties than the upper classes, in terms of being more 
frank and casual  behavior which often makes 
falling in love easier.

Half past midnight on a Saturday, they come out. 
Leaving their vacant refrigerators behind, they flock
 bouncy co-eds, beer-soaked bar flies, Pittsburghs 
late-night lollygaggers  to neon beacons of afterhours grubbing. Diners represent for them  for us 
all  the happy medium between convenience and 
convention: more character than a fast food shack, 
cheaper than your average family restaurant. With 
accessible (ungodly) hours, diners and the greasy 
spoons of greater Pittsburgh cater to a set of individu
als who eat outside the box. And patrons need not 
worry about a light wallet; diners seem to place a pre
mium on the parsimonious. Burgers, omelets, and 
cheese fries  nothing seems to ever exceed ten 
bucks, making for an experience where the amount of 
grease is inversely proportional to the price.
Diners in Pittsburgh, as elsewhere, have found a 
niche. They dont so much buttress the American 
ideal as they succor the unfit  its hard to conduct a
power lunch at three in the morning. Each night they 
open their doors to a motley pastiche searching for 
sustenance, a demimonde not content with the lock
step culinary habits of their fellow foodies. Diners like 
Ritters, Toms, Charlies, and JoJos are there to satis
fy our spur-of-the-moment, flight-of-fancy hunger 
pangs: those college students, club hoppers, and 
truck drivers are out not on any pre-formed pilgrim
age, but for the instant gratification found in a plate of 
ham and eggs with a side of home fries.

Another staple of Pittsburghs late night culture, Toms Diner in the

Upon first glance,

It is nice to see that, in the midst of Whole Foods 
Markets cultivation of a more refined cuisine con
sciousness, there remains in the Pittsburgh palate a 
taste for the grit and grease of Ritters Diner. Open 
24 hours, Ritters needs no advertising; it is well 
regarded as a Pittsburgh landmark not only for the 
food (which is decently divine), but also for the 
honest atmosphere. With quite nondescript decor 
and outdated wood paneling, Ritters finest fur
nishing is the wall-sized mirror in back that allows 
for easy people-watching.
Mere minutes spent eyeing customers through the large mirror should merit anyone a 
doctoral degree in sociology, as Ritters is quite the microcosmic melting pot of a diner. 
Endlessly interesting, the diners clientele all seem engrossed in their own entertaining 
endeavors  from the construction worker dusting himself off before entering to the 
father in the next booth coaxing his son into playing Cheeseburger in Paradise on the 
jukebox to the old man sassing the waitress through his voice box. Perpetually busy, yet 
never overcrowded, Ritters Diner offers both refuge to loners at the counter looking for 
company and sociable sanctuary to drunks in the back in search of attention.
Exhibiting greater social and racial harmony than any other established eatery in 
Pittsburgh, Ritters relies on service that is more friendly than it is fast to quell the com
plaints and conflicts of its diverse demographic. Quick on the coffee and prone to smiling, 
the waitresses at Ritters don nurse-like smocks and hospital shoes for good reason. They 
are the caretakers of each and every customer, maintaining not only the championed chow 
of a venerable dining monument, but also the vitality of Pittsburghs diner culture as a 
whole.
Ritters

Ritters, in keeping with the diner formula, burnishes its menu with a raft of breakfast 
items, but some dinner and lunch choices should not be overlooked. The chicken is serv
iceable but falls short of flavorful for some dishes, the fish (!) is often fried beyond recog
nition and should probably be avoided by the sober-minded (not to be confused with 
sober), but the meat, grilled and fried, is a refreshing change. The hamburger steak, 
anchored just south of the overly-pricey New York strip, is a solid choice. Swathed in a 
deep medley of white and yellow onions, this flattened burger is enough to satisfy any 
Burgher worth his celery salt. Paired with mashed potatoes and a healthy dose of gravy, 
the hamburger steak just might be the poor mans sirloin, if youre so inclined to make the 
stretch.
J\ifter s; ]p<J
Fortunately, Ritters wont take a bite out of your wallet in the same way it does your 
hunger. At $5.95 the steak is a good deal, and with the soup of the day only $.50 more, the 
bargain gets that much sweeter. The cheese tortellini I ordered was rather tasteless, how
ever  someone apparently had overlooked the cheese portion of this appetizer marriage
 and the egg noodles were bland and spare in actual appearance. A green salad fits snug
ly with the steak choice, and mine was fairly crisp and tasty despite 
the knowledge that iceberg lettuce offers little in the way of nutrition 
or variety. Stale-looking bread comes with every entre, but is prop
erly revivified after a few generous pats of butter. Predictably, this 
theme is repeated with most other dishes at Ritters, as butter, mar
garine, and lard are treated as the great binding agents to this diners 
existence, as necessary as the wait staffs friendly banter or the 
kitchen clatter.
messages scribbled on the wallpaper by Hollywood visitors like Robert Downey Jr. and 
Michael Douglas, the walls provide a window to the time and place Toms tries to emulate. 
Unfortunately, this impressive ambience does not extend beyond the smoking section and 
the non-smoking room is an atrocious, prison-style cafeteria with oppressive lighting 
accentuating its intensely sterile environs.
While the food is far less exceptional than the replicated, Pleasantville-perfect diner set
ting, it suffices for the Toms youth-centered customer base that is generally more critical 
of tapped kegs than watery eggs. Comfortably uninhabited during the daytime, Toms 
Diner transforms into a circus of activity at night. When the bars close and the non-sobers 
stumble in, Toms plays host to an array of inebriated hijinks and tipsy tomfoolery. The 
resulting clash between the diners vintage 1950s throwback aesthetic and the South 
Sides late night culture is evident in the abundant pen graffiti that also covers the blackand-white, classic film wallpaper. Its Fox meets Disney.
Comprised of yinzers and modish youth alike, Toms waitressing staff handles the 
harsh workload with more gusto than grace. Managing the ebb and flow of pen-toting 
patrons, they maintain composure even in the most unnerving of situations. This element 
of exemplary service follows suit with the American Dream ethic at Toms Diner, making 
for much more than just another all-night eatery
with soda-shop scenery. Toms

Where to begin? A turn with the hot meatloaf dinner provides a couple of things. At 
$6.45, you get three pieces of meat that look like refugees from a Healthy Choice dinner; 
mashed potatoes flavor more stock than shock; and lifeless green beans that look as pasty 
as a kindergarten art project. The deliciously sturdy country bread that accompanies the 
meal bears little resemblance to the greater disappointment that is your dinner. The cumu
lative experience is such: even for the late-night college crowd and club-hopping glitterati 
on the prowl for quick, cheap eats on a weekends jaunt, Toms will leave a bad taste in 
your mouth.

The South Side 
likes its food. With 
places like Primantis, 
Abruzzis, and Fat 
Heads, youre almost 
certain to get a good 
meal and maybe a few 
drinks for the road. 
Pity then that Toms 
Diner stands out as 
such an inept addition 
to this robust neigh
borhood. With higherthan-average prices, 
Toms failed to deliver 
with taste. Despite its 
retro looks, this South 
Side spot harbors little old school appreciation for the quality of its dishes.

JoJos Diner in the Strip District is nothing fancy. It resembles the Koresh 
Compound cafeteria, but this hole-in-the-wall is not preoccupied with appear
ance. This dingy one-room diner looks like it has long been cleared for con
struction, but from the looks of things, the renovators must have taken a 
decade-long lunch break to grub on JoJos infamous omelets. Truly a 
Pittsburgh original, JoJos is the antithesis of the stylized hipster hangouts of 
New York diners. Blank, white walls lined with plywood planks and stiff, plas
tic booths in cramped seating arrangements make for the least inviting ambi
ence of any Pittsburgh diner. What JoJos does offer, though, is a haven for 
those empty-bellied all-nighters with a hankering for grease-laden cuisine.
Operating from 11 pm through 1:30 pm the next day on weekends, JoJos 
knows its audience and caters to their post-party hunger. Shiny shirt-wearing 
clubgoers rub shoulders (literally) with true urbanites in a loud, congested 
atmosphere. On a typical Saturday night, Pittsburghs woodwork lies empty, 
as all the eccentrics have come out to partake in JoJos scene of the obscene. 
The general raucousness emanating from the riffraff crowd is a soundtrack for 
the indigestion and unsightly sights typical to JoJos Diner. From the haggard 
drunk passing out on his stool with money in hand to the fashionable male
Ritters Diner features a counter for the solitary, booths for the sociable, and diner food by the truckload.
This small, unassuming spot fries up superb breakfast and 
lunch specials daily. On a countertop-long griddle, cooks trade 
ribald asides with the customers as easily as they flip a hotcake.
Omelets, home fries, and strong coffee pretty much round out 
the mornings menu, but dont be put off by the scarcity of 
choice  Charlies makes up for in quality and character what it 
lacks in volume. A steam-faded sign above the metallic range parochially avers that Its a
Burgh thing. With food as good as this, Charlies would fare well to get past its provincial con
ceit and announce the good news to the rest of us.
The JoJo omelet is the Strips equivalent of Marks Stack. 
The plate-length-sized egg concoction is packed with spinach, 
onions, cheese, mushrooms, and a choice of ham, bacon, or 
sausage. An interesting and welcome twist is the addition of 
home fries into this bulky farrago of veggies and cheese. The 
potatoes are a great foil for the spicier meat, and show up in 
thick, scalloped slices. Add toast (I prefer their Italian-style, but the wheat and white arent 
bad) and youve got it  all the eclecticism of The Strip summed up in the toothsome bravado 
of one spoonful.
When an eatery blatantly compartmentalizes its choices by stacks or piles, right away 
any notion of order is quietly suppressed. The point here is fast, heaping helpings of daring 
combos, not perfectly arranged smiley face pancakes. Never one to shy away from a challenge, 
I figured I might try Charlies equivalent of the 800-pound gorilla, that 0196er of eastern 
Pittsburgh, Marks Phat Stack. Basically, Mark (hes either a cook with too much time on his 
hands or a sadist, I swear) throws together as many items as it seems he can for $9.95. The 
stack, as Charlies priciest offering, consists of grits, an order of three pancakes, three eggs, 
home fries, bacon, a tower of toast, and your choice of steak, two pork chops, 
or a 9-ounce ham steak to round out this fat-fest. Some things, like the pan
cakes and eggs, are successfully pulled off; others, like the ordinary grits 
(admittedly not in this Yankees everyday diet) and fairly undercooked pork 
chops will provoke a few eyebrow-raisings. Still on the plus side, however, the 
coffee is bracing and concentrated, ensuring that at the very least youll be 
fully awake should you decide to tackle the Stacks trainload of calories.
JoJos, the best taste choice of all of Pittsburghs diners, especially those serving breakfast on 
an all-night basis, delivers better food at a cheaper price, the golden ticket in this gustatory 
Wonkaland. Stay up, eat out.

chowing down on his incapacitated girlfriends half-eaten entre, the clientele at JoJos is rife 
with entertaining eye candy that will produce a slack jaw and guffaw in any observer.
Adding to the general air of anarchy at JoJos is the staffs dysfunctional family dynamic. 
Tending to the Strip Districts woozy and weary, the waitresses are hard-pressed to handle the 
constant influx of customers. This makes for quite a vulture culture as impatient patrons lend 
a glaring eye to those with food in front of them. A people-watching parlor with a climate of 
crazed consumption, JoJos is the perfect place for those wanting to fill their stomach but not 
leave the party. JoJ(),s

This popular Strip District night spot (doors open at 11 pm 
on weekdays) was the most appropriately diner-esque joint 
of our quartet tour. The menu choices  and there are a num
ber of them  veer towards traditional greasy spoon favorites 
like French toast, scrambled eggs with ham, and burgers and 
blue plates by the dozen. JoJos promises The Best in the 
Strip, and with dinner specials, salads or sandwiches rarely 
topping $6, this diner had the benefit of the doubt in its favor. 
If you can stand the intractable odor of grease burns and deep 
fryer offal, JoJos will dazzle you with its hearty breakfast 
dishes and super sides. Even if the dcor is lacking and the wall 
stains are older than some of your fry cooks, The Best in the 
Strip never promised to win on looks alone.
quaint ambience; its frilled curtains and no-frills culinary presentation giving patrons the feel 
of legitimate home cooking. There is definitely a silver lining to everything within Charlies art 
deco environment  from the authentic, built-in clock to the steel-paneled ceiling  and the 
places only sign of the times is the CD-playing jukebox (which is still chock-full of old soul 
favorites).

Unlike other diners, Charlies does not cater to the nouveau niche of young, moneyed 
nighthawks and is thus sparsely populated with regulars. Limited seating and antiquated 
acoustics provide for an intimate eating experience centered on courtesy and community. 
Charlies Diner is not, however, a parlor for across-the-room conversation; most of its patron
age comes not from garish groups of gossipers, but from introverted individuals perusing the 
paper. Surely not a forum for socio-cultural observation, Charlies allows for a character study 
of unique folks unthinkable in any other setting.
Charlies very personal, homey atmosphere is complemented by the brethren-like bickering 
between its employees. Amidst politicking with the handful of cooks in the open-air kitchen, 
one amiable waitress provides for all the customers, her grandmotherly charm shining through 
as she delivers a strong cup of joe with a smile. Charlies has 
served Pittsburghers in a number of locales during its long 
tenure as a trailer diner, but its wheels have been removed and 
Charlies Diner has finally found a home in Wilkinsburg.

Russian cinema at CMA
Film series to wrap up with traditional Mongolian throat singers
If youre worried that your only 
movie choices this weekend are 
Harry Potter or Eminem, breathe 
easy, because the Carnegie 
Museum of Art is currently screen
ing a series of films that definitely 
dont portray any eleven-year-old 
wizards or ailing white rappers.
Instead, the movies in the 
Kazakh/Tadjik film series explore 
the cultural and social aftereffects 
of the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Kazakh/Tadjik is part of the 
Russian Film Symposium of 2002, 
and organized with the assistance 
of Vladimir Padunov, an Associate 
Professor of Slavic Languages and 
Literatures at the University of 
Pittsburgh. The museum has so far 
screened two of four films by 
renowned central Asian filmmak
ers.
The films are the final part of a 
year-long event called Global 
Amnesia and the Imperial 
Fatigue, supported by both the 
Carnegie Museum of Art and 
University of Pittsburgh. This 
event is a showcase of the cinema 
of Central Asia following the disin
tegration of the Soviet Union. The 
films give a graphic account of 
what life is like after new reform 
policies were passed, granting 
newfound freedoms of assembly, 
speech, religion, the right to strike, 
and multi-candidate elections. 
Unfortunately, these policies also
gave way to long-suppressed inter
ethnic economic and social griev
ances that led to clashes, strikes, 
and growing crime rates.
The two films that have already 
been shown, The Killer (1998) and 
The Road (2001), were both direct
ed by Darezhan Omirbaev and 
were immensely successful over
seas. Next weekend, the museum 
will screen The Fall of Otrar 
(1991). Directed by Arda 
Kamirkulov, Otrar is a historical 
epic set in central Asia in the early 
13th century. The winner of the 
1991 Fipresci (International Film 
Critics) prize at the Locarno film 
festival, this film will be in Kazakh, 
Mongolian, and Mandarin with 
English subtitles.
The last film of this series is Kosh 
ba Kosh (1993) or in English, Odds 
and Evens, and will be screened on 
the weekend of December 7-8. 
Unlike The Fall of Otrar, this film is 
set in modern times and is struc
tured by the impact of the recent 
Civil War in Tajikistan, while 
telling a story of love amidst 
unpredictable and dangerous 
times. Kosh ba Kosh has turned its 
director, Bakhtier Khudoinazarov, 
into an international success and 
won the 1993 Silver Lion Award in 
Venice. The film is in Russian and 
Tadjik with English subtitles.
Following the final screening on
Photos courtesy of the Carnegie Museum of Art
A still from The Fall of Otrar {1991), directed by Ardak Amirkulov. The 
film is in Kazakh, Mandarin, and Mongolian with English subtitles.
Throat singing is accompanied 
by a stringed instrument per
formance.
December 8, Mongolian throat 
singers will perform a tradition 
practiced by some Central Asian 
tribes. Throat singing is a unique 
vocal method that allows for one 
singer to sing with two or some
times even four voices. The muse
um has invited two performers, a 
teacher of Mongolian throat 
singing and his student, to end the 
festival with a concert and demon
stration of their distinctive talents.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Ducks are wonderful creatures. They swim around, they have 
webbed feet, and they eat your stale bread for you. Why, there 
could be no reason at all that anyone could possibly hate a 
duck. Unless that duck is Lobo. Why, 1 remember one summer 
day in particular, when Lobo was ducking around near an eld
erly couple on a park bench. They were eating their sandwiches peacefully, and Lobo 
eyed them suspiciously. Then they started tossing crumbs to the ducks, but never to 
Lobo. He grew jealous, and he violently attacked the elderly couple. Needless to say, 
he had his bread crumbs that day. But Lobo never bore spite towards me, for I always 
gave him the prettiest of flowers.

Kick-Ass
Horoscopes
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): As a vegetarian, the thought of eating 
tofurkey on Thanksgiving will motivate you to boycott the holiday, though 
you will insist on having moral, anti-European expan
sionism reasons.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): When your mom asks 
you to go to the grocery for some festive cider for your 
family feast, she will not be referring to hard cider. You 
dont want to repeat last years embarrassing incident.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): The insomnia you 
aiA V develop over Thanksgiving (your first opportunity to 
sleep in months) will greatly boost your holiday pro
ductivity.
(a&MXt'A \ CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Your moms desire to 
save time and money by combining Thanksgiving with an early Chanukah 
celebration will backfire. Brisket is just not a universally loved 
Thanksgiving food.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Purchasing sliced Giant Eagle lunchmeat for 
your solitary Thanksgiving feast isnt just depressing. With no one around 
to rush you to the emergency room when you grow fuzzy purple spots and 
collapse in a wild epileptic fit, it is just reckless.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): The fact that your parents will not 
put you in the year-end family newsletter is not a message that they dont 
love you. They just forget about you sometimes.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Your bubble of ignorant holiday 
bliss will burst when you come back after Thanksgiving and realize that the 
international students united to convert CMU to the metric system.
Vanessa Shyu/Art StaffSCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Native 
Americans welcome you with open arms, as long as you 
dont steal their land, over-reproduce, rape, and pillage. Oh 
wait. Never mind.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): You will 
seriously consider transferring back to the University of 
Quebec after your roommate fails to understand for the SCORPIO 
2605th time that Canadians dont observe Thanksgiving, and its not 
because no one would want to celebrate eating crummy French food any
way.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Thinking your parents will 
understand your CMU acronym-speak when they obviously wont is more 
reflective of your intelligence than theirs. Youll have to decode your lan
guage to function in the real world by the time you graduate in six years 
anyway.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Your failure to 
become a more independent actual person by going away to 
college will become apparent when you realize that your fam
ily does not eat off Styrofoam plates with plastic utensils at 
home.
PMSC6SPISCES (February 19 - March 20): Your mother will once 
again be dissatisfied with your appearance and make you get a haircut 
before the family sees you like that.
