Senior Metallurgists 
Sponsor Open House
With Applied MetallurgySolution for Industrial Problems 
the central theme, the senior class of the department of metallurgi
cal engineering and the CIT Chapter of the AIMME will jointly 
sponsor an open house in the metallurgy wing of Engineering hall 
on March 24 from 9:30 a. m. until 4:30 p. m.
The purpose of the exhibits is to familiarize students from 
Fine Arts and other departments in the College of Engineering with 
the present and possible future applications of metallurgy to their 
particular. fields.
Architectural and industrial design students from Fine Arts will 
be especially concerned with this program, but students from all 
departments of all three colleges*
are invited to attend.
The plans for the exhibits were 
set up only after students from 
other departments were inter
viewed as to their specific inter
ests.
Included among the topics on 
which demonstrations will be giv
en are the heat treatment of 
steels, those processes of heating 
steels to high temperatures and 
then quenching them in various 
liquids in order to produce ex
actly the desired properties; alum
inum alloys and the properties of 
lightness, strength, and corrosion 
resistancy which are fast making 
them competitors with steel for 
certain applications; and the various techniques and uses of X-ray 
investigations.
The measurement of high tem
peratures, the problems of corro
sion; manufacture, with control 
applications, of small parts; and 
the pouring molten metal into in
got molds will also be demon
strated.
These exhibits will be prepared, 
operated, and explained largely 
by the students of the senior and 
junior classes of the department.
Expected to be of general in
terest to the visitors is the large 
variety and quantity of equip
ment which is to be found in the 
department of metallurgical en
gineering and in the associated 
Metals Research Laboratory.
Under the leadership of Dr. 
Robert F. Mehl, the department 
has reached a top position in the country.
The Metals Research laboratory, 
also headed by Dr. Mehl, has be[Continued on page 5]

that, a more ambitious and pro

According to Loren Smith, pres

a revision of the constitution 
wherein all restrictions regarding 
race, religion, and sex are elimin

The former officers of Scarab 
will continue to hold office in the 
new organization which shall be 
known as the Architectural Stu

Expressing the hope of being

mitory and commuter spirit, vic
torious IAC candidates John An
derson, Robert Fulton, William 
Johns, and J. K. OHare are pre
paring to begin their terms of 
office in Student Council.
Commenting on the independent 
landslide which put their full tick

of the nearest fraternity candi
date, Robert Crago, chairman of 
IAC and electrical engineering 
senior, said: This is the first time 
that I know of that a slate of in

Dr. Synge Resigns As Math Head 
To Accept Appointment In Dublin
Dr. John Lighton Synge will 
resign as head of the department 
of mathematics at the end of this 
semester to be eligible to accept 
a senior professorship in the school 
of theoretical physics at the Dub
lin Institute for Advanced Stud
ies. The Dublin Institute, ex
plains Dr. Synge, is similar to 
the Princeton Institute for Ad
vanced Studies, of which Albert 
Einstein is a member.
When asked why he was leav
ing, Dr. Synge replied, After 30 
years of teaching I would like to 
try something else. At the Dub
lin Institute for Advanced Studies 
I will be able to do what I want 
to do. I can teach or I can do re
search.
Dr. Synge expressed his regret 
at leaving Carnegie Tech: We 
started something here two years ago in applied mathematics. I reDr. John Lighton Synge, resign
ing head of the department of 
mathematics.
gret that I wont be able to be 
here, but I hope that it will con
tinue. I have greatly enjoyed my 
contacts with the students here, 
whom I believe to be as good or 
better in mathematics than any 
other I have met previously.
Dr. Synge received his bach
elor of science degree from Trin
ity College in 1919. In 1920 he 
was made assistant professor of 
mathematics at the University of 
Toronto where he remained until 
1925. He received his masters 
degree in 1922, and his doctorate 
in 1926 while serving as profes
sor of natural philosophy at the 
University of Dublin. From J944 
to 1945 he served as a ballistic 
mathematician with the army air 
forces, and in 1946 he came to 
Carnegie Tech to head the new
ly organized mathematics department.
in with a large margin to spare.
This election shows that there 
is a definite independent interest 
in campus politics.
J. K. OHare, re-elected to 
Council and now its acting presi 
dent, stated, in speaking of the 
aims of IAC, that we are think
ing primarily of the younger fel
lows coming into school. We would 
like to see all of the fun of the 
old dorm and commuter life re
turn.
He pointed out that the pur
pose of IAC is to provide some 
means for an independent to par
ticipate in school politics and ac
tivities.
Next year, the GIs will be 
gone. There will be a group of 
young fellows, and, since the fra
ternities are well organized, we 
hope that we can provide the in
dependent organization to balance 
this strength.
A query on further details of 
their political plans brought 
prompt rejoinder from William 
Johns, management senior: No 
comment!
Asked for his opinion of the 
procedure of the election, OHare 
replied with a smile: We havent 
found anything to protest this 
time.
The IAC leaders were unani
mous in their praise of the part 
which APO played in operating 
the balloting  everything was 
made out long in advance. The 
large number of people who turn
ed out to vote is a tribute to the 
manner in which they conducted 
the election.
They were equally unanimous 
in the caution of their optimism 
Said John Anderson, electrical 
senior: We hope that this goes 
on for awhile and that it wasnt 
just a flash in the pan.
APO Work 
Speeds Polling
IAC has scored a decisive 
victory over the combined 
strength of the fraternity or
ganizations.
Riding the crest of the high
est College of Engineering 
vote cast in many years, Inde
pendent Action Committee 
leaders John Anderson, Robert 
Pulton, William Johns, and J. 
K. OHare swept into Council 
office by heavy pluralities in 
the March 11 election.
Following the complete IAC 
slate but leading the ticket of the 
incumbent fraternity group was 
C. B. Groomes, captain of the foot
ball team and Kappa Sigma inde
pendent.
Fully 49 percent of the 2251 
students registered in the College 
of Engineering and Science voted 
as compared with a 30 percent 
balloting the previous time.
Although the independent cam
paigns were not directly concern
ed with Fine Arts and Margaret 
Morrison, the voting in these col
leges was considerably above that 
of the December 18 election.
MMCC balloting rose to 31 
percent from its previous low of
19, and 28 percent of the eligible 
voters appeared at the Fine Arts 
polls as compared with 22 per
cent the first time.

Editorial
Perpetuation Problem
The gentlemen of IAC have just accom
plished something of note. They have suc
ceeded in arousing independent interest in 
something other than a dance.
This achievement should not be lightly re
garded, for the same problem has been attack
ed many times before and the record of fail
ures is indeed imposing.
Now that this little group has proved it
self to be of sufficient composite wit in both 
matters of fighting politics and public relations, 
its activities will be transferred to Student 
Council. More successes are in sight.
Unfortunately, the general enspiriting ef
fect whieh the I AC triumph has had upon the 
campus and the possibilities which their 
achievement and strength hold for a vigorous 
dormitory life similar to that of other years 
may well be wasted. The last of the group 
will graduate in June of next year.
However, if the good politicians were to 
investigate the possibilities of promoting a 
sweeping reconstruction of Dormitory council, 
or perhaps even of amalgamation with Citcom 
Clan, the results would be interesting to pre
dict
Basing their activities on one or both of 
these already established and presumably per
manent activities, IAC would have a good 
chance of transmitting the presently available 
fire and techniques to another group of equally 
capable men.
Properly executed, this idea could nucleate 
the active campus spirit which pompous and 
non-understanding student leaders have been 
seeking for so long.
There is but one serious difficulty involved 
in this proposal: the high potential which has 
been set up for the acrophobia such as af
flicts the mountain climber who pauses to ad
mire in smug, then frightened satisfaction the 
first ten percent of his climbarid who goes 
no further, convinced that humanity can ex
pect no more from one who has already con
tributed so much.
But is not the problem worth a try when 
the mountain isnt real and the man who gets 
blasted from its very peak by the most tre
mendous cataclysm which the uncontrollable 
elements of Tinyland can summon will fall 
but an inch!
Right Face!
By Robert Charpie
Did you know that here at Carnegie Tech we 
graduate the finest printers to be found? As far as 
publications go we have the technical advantages of 
high quality printing knowledge, right in our stu
dent body, that few other schools can boast. And 
yet, do you realize, that we turn out once a week 
one of the most disgraceful college newspapers to be found???
This should not be construed as a slam at any 
of the people who make up the Tartan staff. If 
hard work were the only thing necessary to make 
the paper a success, the Tartan would certainly 
be one of the best. However, hard work isnt 
enoughit also takes money.
An examination of the past few Tartans will 
show that about 40 per cent of the space each 
week is devoted to advertising. Without a doubt 
this portion of the paper is wasted space as far 
as most students are concerned. On the other hand 
the paper could not be published without this 
excessive burden of ads because the Student Coun
cil hasnt seen fit to give the Tartan staff enough 
money to operate a high-grade newspaper.
Then too, frequently it is hard to tell whether 
you are reading page one frontwards or page two 
backwards unless you get a good substantial sur
face, impervious to light, to do your reading on. 
Cant we afford at least to stake the Tartan to the 
price of a slick-finish paper which would take 
printing more easily? Such action might also dis
pense with the current series of cuts, all of which 
looks like a picture of the Black Hole taken at 
midnight.
Finallyhow about the students getting be
hind the staff and giving them a little support in 
the form of active help. The student body has 
never offered help adequate to do a top-notch 
job of putting out a newspaper. Every staff, from 
reporting to copy-reading, is undermanned.
The college needs a good newspaper to serve 
both as an up-to-date bulletin board and as a 
prestige advertisement for the school. Each of us 
pays a substantial amount of our tuition into the 
General Fund. I feel sure that a poll would show 
that most of the students would rather see a little 
more money spent on improving our papers and 
a little less on the necessities of college lifei. e. 
keys, banquets, and a miscellany of poorly plan
ned and poorly promoted dances in the gym.
Here is a challenge for our new Student Coun
cil. If they are going to keep their collective word 
and promote the interest of the great majority of 
the students, they cannot possibly fail to approve 
a substantial increase in the Tartan budget, for 
the Tartan is one of the very few activities in 
which all of us have a share of the benefits. Lets 
have a newspaper which wont suffer from com
parison.
Flash In The Pan?
British Professor Gives 
Higher Math Lectures
Dr. Norman William McLachlan, visiting Pro
fessor of mathematics, is currently lecturing in 
Theory of Vibrations and Modern Operational Cal
culus.
Deliberate, intense, in Black English-style horn
rimmed glasses and a subdued 
glen plaid suit, Dr. McLachlan has WmmMm 
attracted such personages as Pro
fessors Rosenbach and Moscovitz 
to his lecturesa testimonial to 
the advanced nature of the cours
es.
The eminent Britishers inter
est in higher mathematics grew 
out of his own brilliant career in 
the field of electrical engineering.
Realizing that the mathematical requirements of 
engineering research were not being met by ex
isting educational systems, he set himself/ in the 
1930s, to an intense study of technical and 
applied mathematics. His objective has 
been and is to encourage a school of en
gineering mathematics teachers to sup
plant the purists who were in major 
positions.
As an engineer, Dr. McLachlan spe
cialized in radio, telegraphy and telepho
ny, acoustics, and loudspeakers. He is 
credited with six inventions and is recog
nized as the author of principles and tech
niques in these and allied pursuits.
Even though he has, for some time, 
devoted himself to higher mathematics, 
Dr. McLachlan maintains an active interest in re
search and applied engineering and is now a prac
ticing consultant
On Stage
By Marty Dorff
The story of Le Jongleur de 
Notre Dame, in essence an old 
miracle play, has attracted the in
terest of many writers, who have 
given it one form or another, de
pending upon their individual 
style.
It is probably best known 
through Massenets opera, which 
at one time was a very popular 
vehicle for Mary Garden. The 
emphasis, of course, has tradition
ally been placed on the juggler 
himself and the miracle which he 
occasions.
The Juggler, Russell Graves 
attempt at showing the effect of 
the miracle on the brothers of the 
monastery where it occurs, espe
cially on one sensitive young 
novice, gives a new and original 
twist tc/ this old story.
Throughout the play the writer 
constantly reveals an original and 
impressive talent. I dont mean to 
say that I think the play is a good 
playI dont. But there are cer
tainly many fine and interesting 
features in it.
In the first place, the torture 
and turmoil that beset the young 
novice Jacques, as compared with 
the callous objectivity that Am
brose assumes, is very successfully 
portrayed. The problems of the 
former seem quite real in spite of 
the foreignness of the circum
stances, time, and place. Secondly, 
the atmosphere is well handled: 
the peasants are earthy, and the
monksare quite detached from 
earthly considerations; the differ
ence is very clearly felt. Third, 
the lines themselves are very good 
in many places; Ambrose, espe
cially, has some interesting things 
to say: I am thinking in particular 
of his views on The world be
longs to the young.
The most successful parts of the 
play, however, are the comic in
terludes involving the peasants. In 
fact, judging from this play alone, 
I would guess that Mr. Graves has 
a special flair for sophisticated 
comedy. He manages to wring the 
last possible laugh out of even a 
very simple situation or innocu
ous line: the affair of Brother 
Paul and the bear, for example. 
Antoines boisterous party at the 
beginning of the second act is the 
best scene in the play; it catches 
something of the flavor of a 
Shakespearean low-comedy scene.
What spoils the play is that it is 
poorly proportioned. The first act, 
together with th prologue, is far 
too long. Furthermore, Jacques 
is on stage almost the entire act; 
neither the play nor the playgoers 
can absorb so much of one char
acter, especially since he thinks, 
acts, and talks along only one line. 
Secondly, comedy and tragedy are 
too indiscriminately mixed in the 
first act. I realize that is how 
things often are in real life. Nev
ertheless, the >athos of Jacques 
torture is sure to be forgotten in

TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1948THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Iden Payne To Direct 
Taming Of The Shrew
Shakespeare is again coming to the CIT drama department this 
year with his Taming of the Shrew. And Prof. B. Iden Payne is 
again returning to direct the production.
Prof. Payne, who is visiting Carnegie Tech from his regular post 
at the University of Texas, is widely recognized as an expert in di
recting Shakespearian drama. He was the director of the famedvShakespeare Memorial Theater at Stratford-on-Avon, England, be
fore the recent war. ?----------------------------------------------16 Students 
Receive ROTC 
Honor Awards
Last spring Prof. Payne directed 
King Lear, and the results of 
his work are well known. But not 
as familiar to the student body is 
the man himself, for his brief 
stay on campus was largely con
fined to the drama department.
Perhaps the best description of 
Prof. Payne appeared in the sum
mer, 1947 issue of Cano as a day 
in A Journal, here reprinted 
with the permission of the author 
and the present editor of the magazine.
Mr. Payne has a delicate 
face, weathered to a bonewhitetranslucent, with faint blue veins and rosy vessels. 
Hes built fragilely, as if his 
whole frame were suspended iron, a hanger. He has lank sil
ver hair, little stubs of old dog 
teeth, and eyes as blue as 
bachelor buttons. He wears 
the dense black clothes of an 
undertaker and works with the 
careful precision and thin edge 
of an exquisite fencer. Brood
ing in the back of the chair, the 
little directors bulb reflects 
white light on his glasses.
Henry . . . leans forward
. an ardent disciple  to take 
notes for Mr. Payne. Their rapt 
absorption in the enchanted 
stage world makes them ob
livious of everything else.
The ROTC department an
nounced on March 15 that 16 stu
dents have been designated as 
distinguished military students.
Those receiving the title were: 
David H. Archer, George W. 
Bickerstaff, William A. Bourke, Robert F. Craft, John A. Ewart, 
Donald C. Franz, and Charles E. 
Grimes. Also named were Richard T. Huntoon, Louis H. Knipling, 
James C. Lee, Donald P. Lessig, John M. McGuigan, James K. McNeal, Robert S. Prengle, Alvin F. 
Schafer, and Graham I. Smith. 
The ROTC department announc
ed that these men would receive 
a Distinguished Military Stu
dent medal on Army Day, April 
6.
To be declared outstanding, the 
student must be in the advanced 
course, senior division, and have 
an average grade in his military 
subjects in the upper one third of 
his class. In addition, his academic 
grades must be better than aver
age, and he must have demon
strated leadership through partic
ipation in campus activities.

Each of the seven sororities will 
be given approximately ten min
utes in which to present its por
tion of the show. No restriction 
has been placed on the type of

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1948
Eager Otto Abraham 
Jack t Of-A 11-Sports
Although soccer captain Otto Abraham tries hard to devote 
enough time to his studies, he often finds himself turning to his first 
lovethat of being a jack-of-all-sports.
His election as captain of the soccer team for the coming season 
merely highlighted Ottos long list of athletic and extra-curricular 
activities. A member of Tau Delta Phi fraternity, he serves as ath
letic chairman and represents the fraternity in the Intramural Mana
gers club.
Competing for the Tau Delts in 
basketball, football, volleyball, 
ping-pong, and soft-ball, the 
twenty-two year old mechanical 
engineering junior is one of the 
most active intramural athletes.
As newly elected president of 
the Intramural board, Ottos am
bition is to further improve Car
negies intramural program, al
ready one of the best in the coun
try.
Adding to his list of achieve
ments, Otto worked his way to 
chief operating engineer at sta
tion WCIT and also became cir
culation manager of the Tartan. 
By virtue of the two letters he 
won in soccer, he is now a second 
year member of the fast-growing 
C club.
At the start of the 1946 soccer 
season, Otto was a substitute full
back. Not expecting to play in 
the opening game with Slippery 
Rock, he consumed six donuts be
fore the contest. To his surprise, 
he found himself called upon to 
replace injured halfback Bob Dismukes after two minutes of the 
first quarter had elapsed. Short
ly after he entered the game, the 
donuts reacted on Abraham and 
he collapsed on the playing field. 
Artificial respiration was neces
sary to revive him, but soon after 
the treatment he resumed his po
sition to finish the game. After 
this, Otto played in 31 of the 32

continues to wage the Intramur

Men Giving Trouble 
From Assorted Squads
Before forgetting about basket
ball for another year, or at least 
until spring practice rolls around, 
the Tartans squad met to pick the 
five men who gave them the most 
trouble during the past court sea
son.
At forward, and the only unani
mous choice, is Norm Hankins of 
Lawrence Tech. Hankins, who 
threw in 38 points against Carne
gie, was the leading scorer in the 
nation. At the other forward is 
Dodo Canterna, speedy University 
of Pittsburgh forward. Canterna 
led Pitt in both of its victories 
over the Plaid.
The only team that the Skibos 
managed to defeat twice, Grove 
City, was represented by its cap
tain, Mike Bish. Bish carried the 
brunt of the Grovers scoring for 
the season, and his uncanny hook 
shots found the nets for a total of 
36 points in the two games against 
Carnegie.
Irwin Batnick, stocky Penn 
State guard, and Bob McCullough, 
aggressive playmaker from West
minster, complete the Tartans 
mythical all opponent team. Bat
nick was the difference between 
an upset victory for the Skibos 
and an other loss. McCullough 
proved a steadying influence for 
the Titans when they appeared to 
be falling apart.

the wake of a casual remark about
Brother Paul and the bear.
The production has handsome 
accoutrements in George Corrins 
wonderful settings. The first-act 
set is especially engaging; it 
helped to while away some of the 
doldrums in the later parts of the 
act. Lester Rosenberg gave a sen
sitive and moving portrayal of the 
difficult role of Jacques. Richard 
Cheffey and William Heller did 
well by Francois of the trained 
bear. George Fieldman as An
toine was a most engaging thief. 
David Clark was very successful 
as the well-meaning but ineffect
ual prior. In a brief appearance as 
Brother Paul, Joseph Dove made 
one of the sharpest and most 
pleasing impressions of the even
ing.
Vincent OBrien and Joseph 
Schlafman interpreted Ambrose in 
a considerably different light; the 
former played him as a tired and 
kindly, but weak-willed, selfish 
old man; the latter played him as 
an overbearing, vengeful old man. 
Both interpretations are valid, 
well, and consistently worked out; 
you pay your money and take your 
choice.
The second cast was not in very 
good form the night I saw it; I 
heard more lines muffed than I 
have heard in the Little Theater 
for a long time.
In sum, the play is far from a 
masterpiece. Yet it contains some 
very fine things and is well worth 
the effort of producing it. I hope 
we may look forward to some 
more-seasoned works of Mr. 
Graves in the future.

Mote
By William Schnitgen
A review of the efforts of the 
1947-48 Tartan cagers leads to the 
enlightening conclusion that the 
Plaid should schedule more games 
with their country cousins from 
Grove City.
The past season was inaugur
ated and ended successfully by 
trouncing the Wolverines. The in
terim happenings are a vastly 
different story.
Boasting a 5-14 record, the Tar
tans werent exactly the hottest 
thing in tri-state basketball but 
the victory column shows a 67 per 
cent increase over the previous 
seasons 3-16 total.
The reason for the 14 losses is 
found in the scoring column. The 
CIT men found the basket for 898 
points and a 47.0 points per game 
average.
Regardless of the large number 
of reserves, the Plaid played bad 
basketball in only three of the 
early season games. Waynesburg, 
W & J., and Thiel fans witnessed 
these poor exhibitions on their 
home floors. Lawrence Tech 
trounced the Plaid, but this was 
just a case of meeting a much bet
ter team.
In the middle of the season the 
Tartans were hot but not quite 
able to overpower their opponents. 
Seven games were lost by close 
scores where a little luck could 
have reversed the decisions. How
ever as the season rolled on and 
the defeats mounted, the team 
performed shoddily against Alle
gheny, Westminster, and Grove 
City.
Dependable Mike Theodore was 
the Tartans big man both on of
fense and defense. While guard
ing the opponents chief scoring 
threat in most games Mike man
aged to amass 100 field goals and 
69 fouls for 269 points. His total 
gave him the lead for the team and 
also placed the all-city crown on 
his head. 
Jack Riehl, Bob McCullugh and
Dave Ellies followed in order in 
the scoring race to jointly add 357 
points in supporting Theodore. 
Although Marty Chetlin contrib
uted but 89 markers, his fine spirit 
and floor play made him one of 
the most valuable members of the 
team.
The stroll to the foul line proved 
to be the teams undoing over the 
course of the season. Although 
awarded 459 free throws, they 
were able to convert only 209 
while missing 250 for a 45.5 per 
cent average.
Prospects for next year are 
promising, although the Plaid is 
not expected to set the world on 
fire. Every member of the squad 
that finished the season will be 
eligible for competition next sea
son. This includes Jack Riehl who 
recently left school so that he 
could return next fall with a full 
year of eligibility remaining.
Last season several new players 
were responsible for giving Car
negie the strength that at least 
kept it in the same class as most 
of the opposition. McCullugh and 
Bianchi were two young freshmen 
who developed style and poise as 
the season progressed. Dave Ellies, 
although slightly older, after re
ducing to his normal playing 
weight helped the team no end 
and should be a mainstay of the 
squad next year.

Betas Stay Unbeaten; 
Sigma Nu Now Second
PiKA continues to set the pace 
in the Set Shot basketball league, 
but only after an assist from the 
DUs who dropped a very import
ant game to the Betas. Emanon 
handed PiKA its first setback of 
the season after they had rolled 
over their opponents in the first 
seven games.
In the feature game of the week 
Sigma Nu moved into undisputed 
possession of second place by de
feating Kappa Sigma. Despite a 
shot at the wrong basket by Pete 
Wrong-way Cregut, the Sigma 
Nus were able to solve their op
ponents trick defense in the sec
ond half to win 30-24. Motter of 
Kappa Sig continued to pace the 
intramural scoring leaders as he 
threw in 12 points.
AAA jumped over a couple of 
teams in the standings into third 
place by defeating the Tau Delts 
35-21. The Delts defeated ATO 
42-37 and Section 3A 34-33 to 
bring their average up to an even 
.500.
The Betas easily maintained 
their unblemished record by 
trouncing the Phi Kaps 48-27. 
Clay scored nine points to lead 
the winners.

Fulton and Johns, the other two 
IAC candidates, polled 4397 and 
4273 respectively.
C. B. Groomes fell just short of 
4000, and the remainder of the 
winners followed him at fairly 
close and even intervals. But nine 
points separated low-winner Ray
mond Kondrat and high loser 
Carl Levy.
William Eckles led the Fine Arts 
voting with a 52 point margin over 
his nearest competitor, Anita Nel
son. Margaret Morrison balloting 
was somewhat closer, with Ethel 
Friedman beating out Myra Jane 
Barry for third place by only four 
points.
Called a material factor in the 
independent success, the new, 
IAC-sponsored voting system ma
terially speeded the balloting. It 
was operated by Alpha Phi 
Omega, scouting service fraternity, 
under the direction of Robert 
Shapiro, chairman of the Student 
Council elections committee.
Said Shapiro of APOs work: 
They did the best job of this type 
that I have ever seen and deserve 
most of the credit for the large
number of ballots cast at this 
election.
William Clarke, chairman of 
the APO elections committee, did 
especially good work in organiz
ing and preparing for the work 
done at th polls.
Observers commenting on the 
independent victory agreed with 
the elections chairman that the 
high speed voting procedure had 
accounted for much of the heavy 
voting which had been considered 
a prerequisite for this type of re
sult, but pointed out that heavy 
pre-election campaigning had also 
contributed much.
The IAC poster campaign was 
considered to have been effective, 
but individual canvassing in the 
dormitories, reported to have been 
both extensive and thorough, was 
called an even larger factor.
Kappa Sigma independent C. B. 
Groomes, running on a ticket en
tirely separate from that of IAC 
and using a separate campaign, 
said upon his election:
The fact that my campaign was 
successful when backed only by 
the Kappa Sigma fraternity and a 
number of other friends indicates

not yet witnessed this year in the 
Little Theater.
Even considering Mr. Graves is 
a student, we cannot feel that the 
play was worth presentation. It 
was over-wordy, unduly long and 
apparently missed the point. In 
fact, it seemed at times as though 
Mr. Graves were preaching about 
something concerning which he 
had no knowledge.
Reflecting the character of the 
drama, there is little to commend 
in the acting. David Clarks kind
ly Prior and Joseph Doves laughprovoking Brother Paul were the 
only performances worthy of note.
Special mention must be given 
to Gaylord Hawkins Peter, for 
there was a bear with human un
derstanding yet animal reactions.
Heres your chance to

ating class.
Why not drop 
in and discuss it?

Why Criticize 
Instructors?
Editor, The Plaid:
Granted that no one has asked 
my opinion on the question, nev
ertheless, I intend to Diast my dor
mant thoughts hoping that per
haps some of them may alight on 
the pages of the PLAID.
Is it fair on the part of the even
ing student to be consistently crit
ical of his instructors? Before any 
student should attempt to answer 
this question, he should think the 
issue through conscientiously and 
should ask himself, Have I actu
ally prepared my assignments to 
the best of my ability? Do I 
make it a habit of jotting down 
comments about my assignments 
so I can ask the instructor intelli
gent questions? And above all, 
Do I attempt to enjoy my 
studies?
No student is ever fortunate 
enough to find his entire curricu
lum suited to his scholarly appe
tite. Thus one should make a sin
cere effort to direct extra time and 
energy into thorough enjoyment and appreciation of disliked 
courses, rather than venting his 
efforts into hate for instructors. An 
important point to remember is 
that no instructor enjoys flunking 
a student, for each student who 
passes a course is a tribute to his 
teaching abilities.
The registrar or director of 
evening classes is willing to be 
helpful to students who are hav
ing a difficult time with their 
studies, but I am sure students 
could solve their problems more 
satisfactory if they would explain 
their difficulties to instructors or 
department heads.

gineering Department. Formal ac
tion will be taken on accepting Mr. 
Miller at a later meeting.

its excellent evening school in
structors and the present group of 
faculty members is no exception. 
Give them half a chance.
And remember: you are just as 
much a part of the classroom as is 
the instructor. F. M.
