Burying Of 
The Hatchet

Ceremony
ENDS HAZING PERIOD
Home brew, they say, improves 
with ageso does the Fall Festival. 
Last years exhibition was a decided 
improvement over those of previous 
years, hut the performance on the 
athletic field last Saturday, evening 
was so well done that it would be 
foolish to attempt a comparison. 
Everything went along so smoothly 
that one received the impression that 
the program had' been thoroughly 
practiced and rehearsed. But, as a 
matter of fact, the entire chorus of 
plebes had never heard that there 
existed such a pageant until the very 
last minute. The way they carried 
their part speaks well for their spirit, 
and if they continue to grow and im
prove it wont be long before they 
can appreciate the thrill that comes 
with the realization that theyre real 
Tech boosters.
The Fall Festival is an annual 
-event at Tech which comes at the 
end of the first three days of school. 
It is an Indian play in pageant form 
symbolizing the spirit of the four 
schools. On perhaps the actual battle 
field of the old Indian tribes the 
Sophomores and plebes fought a sym
bolic battle which was brought to a 
close by the intervention of the Senior 
tribe. The war hatchet was then 
buried and the pipe of peace was 
:smoked as a symbol that all hostilities 
were forever done away with and that 
the plebes were admitted on suffer
ance -into participation in the priv
ileges enjoyed by attendance at Tech.
The leading characters were cast 
from the .Dramatic department and 
the parts' were so well taken that 
some strangers weie overheard to re
marks that the actors surely must be 
professionals hired for the occasion.
Tlie pageant, which was originally 
written by Mr. Stevens, of the Dram
atic department about four or five 
years ago, was this year produced 
under the directorship of Jack Williard. Larry Paquin was the stage 
manager and William MacAteer had 
charge of the lighting effects.
___ The principal role, that of the Soph"omore chief, was exceptionally well 
taken by Joseph Lazarus. The other 
principal actors were:
The Northern Chief ... .'Arthur Lubin 
The Eastern iChief. .Burdette Kappas 
The Western Chief... .Park McClure 
The Southern Chief. .Vincent Malloy
The Senior Chief........Carl B. Reid
The Plebe Chief..........Bernard Izold
The Runner ................Phillip Thorn
Near the close of the performance 
it looked like rain and some enthu
siastic souvenir hunter, who didn't 
wish to see the hatchet become damp, 
very secretly purloined the tool and 
disappeared in.thed arkness. The pro
gram closed with a big plebe bonfire 
and a selection by the band.
Once more the "burying of the 
hatchet was performed, marking the 
beginning of another epoch in the liis-tory of Carnegie. For fifteen years the

NOTICE MUSICAL CLUB MEN!
Tryouts for mandolin and glee clubs 
will be held in the Union Sunday, 
September 25th, at 2:30 p. m. All 
plebes who play flute, clarinet, saxo
phone or banjos are especially urged 
to try out. All insignia men are asked 
to be present,  also insignias will be 
given out at this time.
FOOTBALL MEN
GIVEN RECEPTION
NO DELAY IN 
REGISTRATION
Much TimeSaved by New 
SystemMany Applicants 
Not Admitted
On Monday morning there were two 
thousand students registered ready to 
go to class. Different from former 
years because the period for regis 
tration was not during the same week 
as beginning of classes. Consequently 
the students did not waste a couple of 
days. This allows extra time for hol
idays in the future, if the occasion 
arises.
More applications for admission to 
tlie school received thisi year than 
ever before, but the facilities limit the 
Freshman class to about last years 
number.
There are students here from all 
over the globe. Monday morning a 
young man came in to Mr. Brights 
office from Bomlbay, India. Nearly 
every state in the union is repre
sented.
Most everyone registered promptly 
on the' days designated. This greatly 
aids the faculty in getting classes or
ganized. Credit must be given the 
registrars office for the capable man
ner in which the work was handled.
CROSS COUNTRY 
PROSPECTS
Return of Veterans Gives 
Promise of Good Year
Saturday night in the gymnasium 
Tech welcomed her football warriors 
:back fronf training camp. A large 
crowd was in attendance and enthus
iastically welcomed the gridiron men.
The affair followed the hatchet 
burying festivities oh the athletic 
: field.
Boxing bouts were held, Ham Witmer vs. Barry, a newcomer at Tech 
with an enviable' record. Cy Com
fort and Don Potter mixed things up 
a bit and in the second round, at the 
suggestion of Wally :Steffen, at
tacked Bert Munhall, the plucky ref
eree. The crowd later assembled in 
Langley Lab where the football squad 
was introduced by Coach Steffen,aft
er he himself had been presented by 
Buddy Overand. The players were 
well received, and appeared quite as 
much at home as on the field.
Teddy bears and kewpie dolls were 
raffled off, and dancing followed, the 
music being furnished by Hughes 
.and his jazz crowd.

With the opening of the college 
year comes tlie thought of cross coun
try as well as of football. Tech has 
liad a team each season which lias car
ried out schedules with a fair amount 
of success. There have been notable 
victories along with the defeats. Last 
fall the Plaid runners made a good 
showing. They defeated Lehigh on 
the local course in the first meet of 
the season and were defeated by La
fayette in the only other meet. How
ever, Tn the latter event Captain-elect 
Miller finished third, breaking Lafay
ette's record of two perfect score 
wins. Lafayette had one of the best 
teams in the east, holding the eastern 
intercollegiate championship.
The prospects are bright for this 
year. With such men as Hiller, Cavett, McDonald, Foster and Captain 
Miller, all veterans, to build a team 
around, it looks as though Tech would 
make a name for itself in cross coun
try this season. Undoubtedly fc$ere 
are some men in the entering classes 
who will show promise of making the 
team. The schedule. as yet is only 
a tentative one. A meet with Lehigh 
is practically assured and negotia
tions are under way with several oth
er institutions. Practice will begin in 
earnest this week with frequent runs 
over the Schenley Park course. Signs 
will appear about the campus calling 
for candidates. It is hoped that k 
goodly number will turn out so that 
a squad of thirty or forty men may 
start the1 season.

DAVIS REPRESENTS '-
Last Friday night the Gym was the 
scene of a? lively time indeed. The 
stag Pep' Party, under the auspices 
of the (Student Council, was in full 
swing.
F. I. Smith, president of the Student 
Council, started the program with the 
introduction of Mr. Davis, the campus
Y secretary. Mr. Davis, in his very in
teresting talk, expressed the hope 
that a very close bond of friendship 
between the students and the Y 
would be formed during the coming 
year.
Nichols, president of last years 
Student Council, gave a very excel
lent address on the tradition of "Dear 
Old Tech. He emphasized the fact 
that the present entering class should 
strive to fill their place in the 
campus life still better than their 
predecessors were able to do.
The serious side of college life was 
then presented by Dean Mott, in a 
very forceful manner.
The next part of the program con
sisted of two boxing bouts and a 
wrestling match. The boxing was 
'furnished by the Willow Athletic club 
of Lawrence park. The men of this 
club demonstrated the fact that they 
could handle their mitts very well in
deed. Joe Ryan and Terry McMartus 
showed very good form in the first 
round, while Harvey Metz and Harvey 
Handip furnished the thrill for the 
second. Jack Metz separated tlfe 
clinches.
Tlie wrestling'match was staged by 
two Tech men, "Red Cummings and 
"Ally' Trechel. Both boys showed 
very good form. Schrader, better 
known as 'Soako Jack, refereed the 
match.
In tlie meantime in between time, 
a very delightful form of entertain
ment in the way of songs and talks 
was furnished by Overseas Imperial 
Quartet. This group of men deserve 
very great praise in the way they pre
sented their part of the program.
BAND PRACTICE 
TOMORROW NIGHT
First football practice on the home 
field was' held last Monday afternoon. 
The men enjoyed a rest since last Fri
day and were in fine spirits. A hard 
scrimmage was put through. It was 
the first opportunity the students had 
to see the new men in action and the 
grandstand was half filled with spec
tators. Steffens is giving the squad a 
hard workout this week to whip the 
team into shape for the opening game 
this Saturday. The field is hard com
pared with the lot used at camp and 
as a result the boys were bruised 
.slightly. (Several men were hurt, so 
that they will be out of practice for 
a few. days. The hardest hit were 
Griggs and Comfort. Griggs has a 
badly injured foot and may be out 
for some time. Comforts hand is in 
bad shape, but it is hoped that he will 
soon be on the field again. There 
will be~practice every afternoon for 
the two squads, varsity and reserve. 
Coach Parks, a man of wide football 
experience, who was a star on the 
Syracuse eleven some years ago. has 
charge of the training of the reserves 
and will no doubt develop a strong 
eleyen of second string men. A sched
ule is being arranged for these men 
that will include some strong second
ary schools. Any men who are inter
ested in trying out for this squad 
should report immediately.
When school starts tlie Carnegie 
Tech band starts. Preparations for 
the opening football game with Thiel 
are being made. The regular practice 
was held Monday night and another 
is scheduled for tomorrow night in 
the Union at 7 p. mi.
"Sully" or A. J. Sullivan, band di
rector, is back on the job more de
termined than ever to put out the 
best band possible.
A good many of the old men are 
back' in their places ready to go the 
rounds another year. A few new men 
have shown up, mostly plebes, but 
not enough. As yet no alto players 
have shown up and another bass could 
be used to advantage. The clarinet 
section is not what it used to be, and 
only two saxophone players ' have 
shown up so far.
Plebes who intend to try out for the 
band must, report Thursday night, be
cause practice must be had before 
the football game.
NOTICE TARTAN CONTRIBUTORS
At present there are uo permanent 
headquarters for the Tartan because 
of changes made in Central building*. 
Students who are working on the pa
per are therefore requested to look 
up someone on the staff for assign
ments. Also any new people who wish 
to do something on the publication 
should do likewise. Any copy should 
be left at the school postoffice before 
Friday evening.
New Store in 
Central Building
M. M. C. Store Closed, New 
Plan More Economical
With a view to making the Institute 
salesroom more convenient as well as 
to provide for expansion, it has been 
moved from the old location in In
dustries, to the basement of the Cen
tral building. This is not only a much 
more convenient place for the stu
dents. of all schools, but the new ar
rangements made will greatly in
crease efficiency.
The new store room is now the 
only one for the whole school, the 
Design and M. M. C. store rooms hav
ing been incorporated in it. This not 
only eliminates useless duplication of 
stocks, but allows any and all stu
dents to 'buy all their supplies at one 
place at one time.
The store room manager, Mr. Thos. 
McConley, made good use of his many 
years experience and his ideas as to 
the arrangement of the fixtures and 
supplies have made the new place 
very convenient. A special feature is 
the wide new window, where a half 
dozen customers may be served at 
once, instead of one or two as at the 
old plape. Many extra clerks have 
been engaged and prompt service will 
be given during the usual rush at the 
beginning of the year, as well as dur
ing all school hours during the year. 
Naturally the whole student body 
cannot be served in the first day or 
two of school, but the Inconvenience 
and. delay formerly experienced will 
be much reduced by the good will and 
co-operation of the students.

SOPHS WIN ANNUAL
CONTEST FROM PLEBES
Varsity Squad 
Tentatively Picked
Coach Steffens has announced a 
tentative classification of the men on 
the football roster. To better facili
tate the training he has made two di
visions namely squads "A and "fe. 
The first mentioned includes the old 
team and some of the new men who 
have made a good impression. Play
ers will be transferred to this group 
when Walley" has seen enough of 
them to enable him: to form an opin
ion.
The following names appear on the 
first squad: K. S. Alexander, James

Plenty of Excitement Furnished by 
the Tl'e-up, the Decisive Event
Last Friday afternoon the Sophs 
and the Plebes had their annual class 
contests on the Tech field. Before the 
events started the Plebes furnished 
plenty of amusement for those pres
ent and during the events they used 
their lung power In cheering for their 
side.
The first event, the relay race; was 
won by the Plebes, McClelland, the 
last Plebe to run, decided the event 
in the Plebess favor, and we expect 
to hear more from this fellow in track. 
The centipede race came next and 
was very close. The Sophs, by win
ning this event, tied the score. The 
horse and rider contest was also won 
by. the Sophs but the Plebes evened 
up the score when Whitman Avan over 
Goodman in the 135-lb boxing event. 
This brought an uprise from the 
Plebes when Whitman was carried off 
the field on the shoulders of four 
other Plebes.
In the wrestling match Fritz, Soph, 
beat Trinbad, but^ the Plebes again 
evened the score by winning the 
hustle ball contest.
The last event the tie-up, was then 
the deciding one. Seventy Sophs and 
the same number of Plebes were 
given ropes with which they were to 
tie up an opposing contestant and car
ry him behind the goal posts on their 
side. At the blow of the whistle each 
side went into it with dead earnest. 
At the end of the scheduled time and 
after the dust of the battle had set
tled the 'Sophs had tied up 28 while 
the Plebes had only 2G. This gave 
the contest to the Sophomores and 
now the Plebes will have to remain 
under regulations until after Qualifi
cation Day next spring. These con
tests were very Interesting, but there 
were not so many present.

PLEBES BATH IN 
NEW PARK POOL
It was indeed a strange sight which 
greeted the eyes on approaching the 
campus last Friday. On Wood lawn 
avenue numberless plebes were con
fessing their love for the fair co-eds'. 
On the lawn in front of Design school 
some Ingenious prospective englnoor 
had laid a railroad track compound o 
Freshmen. Over this express trains 
wore runningeach train being com
posed of a plebo walking on his hands, 
boing pushed by the foot of a second 
plebe.
The grand flnalo was readied that 
night whon the Sophs decided to hold 
a midnight pajama parade. The un
willing plebes Wore routed out of 
their bods and horded In linesomo 
were clad in nightshirtsbut most 
wore pajamas of various hues, lromi a 
dolicately striped blue to a fuchia 
pink. In fact the campus was a aplurgo 
of color. The victims wore then drag
ged around to / the various girls 
dorms, where they insisted hi stand
ing under the windows and giving 
vent to their joy by singing. "How 
Dry I am." Tills selection mot with 
such universal disapproval that the 
plebes feelings were quite dampened 
nay, even soaked!
The Sophs refused to call It a night 
and, in order to make the evening 
complete, marched the closs of 25 up 
to the new swimming pool In Schenley 
park. They didn't stop at this point 
but marched the plebes through the 
pool.
The swimming party was finally 
broken up by the timely arrival of the 
Oakland police force, accompanied by 
the "Black Maria. This mistake on 
the part of the police plainly showed 
that are of the September Morn 
variety is not appreciated and the 
Sophomores have now decided that 
the world is indeed a cruel, cruel 
place to live in.
It is hoped that the welcome ten
dered the plebes will be appreciated 
and that the new class will now have 
some idea of its uselessness in gen
eral.

Dr. Thomas Stockham Baker, Secy. 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
My dear Mr. Baker:
Our Scout year and your student 
year is about to open. I am sure that 
this is the opportune time to call to 
the attention of your men students 
who have been previously interested 
in scout work that Troop 58, with 
headquarters at the First Unitarian 
church on the corner of Morewood 
arid Ellsworth avenues, will be only 
too glad to have them feel free. to 
come in and help us with our work.
Will you, therefore, kindly call this 
invitation to tho proper authorities! for 
spreading the information around 
among tho men students.
I hardly need to emphasize the 
splendid qualities that scouting 
brings out in both tho scouts and 
those who yfork with them and that 
it is a work that ought to appeal to 
all young men.
Cordially yours,
K. C. WALKER, 
Asst. Scout Master, Troop 58, B. S. A.
With the opening of the Carnegie 
Tech football season only a matter 
of days now, the Tartan squad is in 
good shape, and anxiously awaiting 
the starting whistle. The men have 
withstood; tlie> hard scrimmages at 
Camip Louise Carnegie with very few 
injuries,' and with no injuries which 
might keep a .player from giving his 
best for Tech when the moment ar
rives. The squad carried over from 
last years team are all in good shape 
and this, coupled with the fact that 
they thoroughly understand the Stef
fen system, will in all likelihood mean 
that they will start the game with 
Thiel college at Tech field, Septem
ber 224th. While there are a num
ber of good men among the new-com
ers, they are not yet proven, and will 
therefore receive second considera
tion in handing out the honor of who 
will start' the ball rolling for Tech 
this season. Again, it. is an assured 
fact that before the end of the gamo 
a largo number of tlid new-comers 
will have been given an opportunity 
to show what they have along the lino 
of football calibre.
Chief among these new-comers who 
will more than likely receive an op
portunity to show their wares are 
Gove, Lewis, Mills; Newman, Pottor, 
Ave and iSawyor. All of those men 
show signs of developing Into good 
men for Tech. Gove, Mills and Lewis' 
are all ibackfield men; Gove being,of 
tho light, ^shifting, fast brokon-fiold 
runnor type, and ought to develop Into 
a good end-run man. The same might 
bo said of Lewis, while Mills and 
Newman are of tho houvy, line-buck
ing typo, and should give material aid 
to Brumbaugh in his ofll-tacktle and 
straight lino bucks. Potter, at omt, 
should devolop into one of tho two or 
throe valuable ends. Ave shows signs 
of dovolopmont into a good guard, 
bocauso of his weight, and willing
ness to learn. Toch has in Nowmun 
a man who knows how to punt. Aside 
from tli9so men there are many others 
who soemi to know a varying amount 
of football, coupled with an also 
varying amount of natural ability. To 
pick out any man would not bo ex
actly fair to the remaining, because 
they are all about of tho same calibre 
of fighting Toch men, and after a 
trial might show they are worth their 
weight in gold to tho team.
Alexander is a heavy lineman and 
likely will be a good man in time. 
Sawyer shows signs of being a iast 
runner and carries the ball well, 
though showing a tendency to lose his 
feet occasionally and has a tendency 
to turn his back in running. Around 
this man, a good forward passing 
game might be built, which should 
materially aid the team in a close 
game.
White has not the strong physical 
make-up of most of the men, but Is 
one of the nerviest men on the squad.
A large crowd is expected at tho 
opening game next Saturday, becauso 
the students and people of Pittsburgh 
are anxious to see the team In ac
tion. Also this is the first college 
football game of the season, in this 
city. New seats have been put up, 
greatly increasing the seating capac
ity at the field. All seats in the old 
grandstand will be reserved.
Thiel college will send a good team 
here, and the boys are not taking 
any chances, or are they over-confi
dent of victory.
Geneva college will play the varsity 
here Saturday, October first.
The Penn State 
Excursion
Those who have not purchas
ed their stamp folders for the 
Penn State trip had better in
vest now, so as not to be dis
appointed when the game Is to 
be played. Last weeks Tartan 
explained the method of using 
savings stamps to enable pur
chasers to secure tickets to the 
game, and great, numbers of 
Tedhltefe availed' themselves of 
the opportunity to go to the State game.
It's not too late, at this time, 
to start saving for your ticket. 
Go to the nearest stamp agency, 
and start your folder. Every 
body's going to the State game.

IN WHAT ACTIVITIES WERE YOU ENGAGED?
At the present time, more than ever, employers and critics oil the 
college man are demanding that he enter into activities. Questioniares sent to applicants, who are in search oil a job, usually contain 
the question: In what activities were you engaged?
Employers realize the difference between the man with activities 
and the man without activities. The man who has engaged in ac
tivities is a greater asset to his employer because his employer knows 
that he is a well-rounded man; a good mixer, a man of responsibility 
and a man who has the ability to put something across. He is obtain
ing a man who has acquired tact and experience to a greater degree 
than the average man.
Activities at Carnegie are varied enough that a man may choose 
the activity which he is best suited for. Activities, publications, musi
cal organizations and. class officers offer enough opening for an 
aspirant.,.
If the material benefit is not an advantage gained, tliere is your 
Alma Mater to think, of. The Band, for instance, in public perform
ance, is supposed to represent the best the student body can do, when 
there are a dozen or more fellows in school, who could aid the Band 
but have not the initiative to come out. This is true of every ac
tivity.
Then there is the satisfaction of doing something well. The ac
complishment of something, well done is a pleasure to any man, great 
or small. Once having tasted that pleasure, the demand is ever 
increasing and it is this demand that has pushed many a man to 
success.
I$o excessive urging can be made that every man of Carnegie 
Tech, and especially the Plebes, take up some activity and work his 
hardest, because the advantages are toogreat to be overlooked and 
the sooner every man realizes this the sooner will Carnegie Tech 
become a better school producing heller men.

Our Institutions of Higher Learning 
Provincial About the Others
By JAMES R. AGELL, President Yale Univorsity
It is interesting how very provincial our American institutions of 
high learning are about other American institutions, and how little they 
know what is going on outside their own sphere of activity.
It is certainly necessary that we should take a reasonably intelligent 
outlook of those' things which are being done abou^ us; the matter.of the 
preceptorial system at Princeton ,and how it is working out; how our 
friends at Amherst are succeeding'in their attempt to revive interest in 
the classical studies ancl how Harvard is succeeding in its endeavor to in
troduce a type of general examination. It is a matter of interest that we 
should know how in the Middle West the great institutions are endeavoring 
to work out some combination of the professional with the classical edu
cation. These are all things that any man who is interested in higher edu
cation should have some knowledge of and some interest in.
I feel that there is a considerable opportunity of improving our rela
tions among American institutions of higher learning bysome more selfconscious examination of the educational movement as it goes on incen
ters, other than our own.

I# CHAKLB3 DICKENS 
Cor ifewten Mtn Emm A. Hamlin
Charles John Huffam Dickens was; 
born Feb. 7, 1812, at], 
Portsea, England,, 
where his fatherwas a clerk in the 
navy pay office. I-Ie 
died at Gadshlllj 
Place, In Kent, on' 
June 9, 1870.
His dream of 
writing came to 
him early when aB 
a boy he r o a d; 
breathlessly the 
battered novels Inj 
his father's library.j 
He became a re-, 
porter on the Lon-i 
don newspapers,, 
and wrote (1830), 
"Sketches by Boz,"' 
wherein are, in, 
miniature, all the 
abounding virtues 
of his novels.
T h e "Pickwick: 
Papers (1837) were, 
a great success.
Their inimitably 
rollicking humor captivated the English; 
reading world. His first extended riovol 
was "Oliver Twist (1838), followed by. 
"Nicholas ,Nickleby (1838-39), Old Curi
osity Shop and Barnaby Rudge (1840- 
41) lie produced some sixteen major 
novels, the last, "The Mystery of Edwin 
Drood (1870), being unfinished. David 
Copperfiold (1859-60), held by many to be 
his masterpiece, and by not a few to bo 
the greatest ~Btory ever written, is sup
posed to be semi-autobiographical. Many 
of his novels were published in install
ments, and never before or since has any) 
literary publication excited such a furore.
After his Initial successes Dickens* llfo 
was a triumphal procession, saddenod 
only by domestic unhappiness. He visited 
America, where his works were oven 
more popular than in England, in 184U and 
18G7-G8.
Ho wrote in his will his own best epi
taph: "I rest my claims to the remem
brance of my country on my published 
works " Ho might well have substituted 
the world for my country."
PerilapB the quality that distinguishes 
his novels among all others is their 
abounding humor.
O
N a cold November night, in the 
year 1775, the English mail 
coach, on Its way from London 
to Dover, was carrying among Its pas
sengers a Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a London 
banker of the well-known firm of 
Tel Ison & Co. As the coach stumbled 
along in the darkness, there arose be
fore him the vision of an emaciated 
flguro with hair prematurely white. 
All night between him and the spectre 
the same words repeated themselves 
again and again.
"Burled how long?
"Almost eighteen years.
"I hope you care to live?
"I cant say.
About eighteen years before the 
story opens, Dr. Manette, a prominent 
young physician of Paris, had sud
denly disappeared. Everything was 
done to discover' some trace of him, 
but in vain. The loss of her husband 
caused his wife such anguish that she 
resolved to bring up her little daughter 
in Ignorance of her fathers fate; and 
when in two years she died, she left 
llttlo Lucie under the guardianship of 
Tell son & Co., . to^whose care Dr. 
Manette for many years had Intrusted 
ids financial affairs.
Strange tidings concerning the Doc
tor had just come from Paris, and Mr. 
Lorry was on his way to meet his 
ward, and explain to her the fucts of 
her early life. This was a duty from 
which the kind-hearted banker shrank, 
and when he saw the slight goldenhalred girl who came to meet him, his 
heart almost failed him; but his task 
was accomplished at last.
"And now, concluded Mr. Lorry, 
your father has been found. He is 
alive, greatly changed, but alive. He 
has been taken to the house of a for
mer servant in Paris, and we are going 
there. I to identify 1dm, you to re
store him to life and love.
The servant that sheltered Dr. Ma
nette was a man by the name of Defarge who, with his wife, kept a wine
shop in the obscure district of St. An
toine. The banker and Lucie were 
taken to an attic where n haggard, 
white-haired man sat on a low bench, 
making shoes, a wreck of a man, ob
livious of all around him.
Again was the 'Channel crossed, and 
again the old inquiry whispered In the 
ear of Jarvis Lorry:
"I hope you care to be recalled to 
life?
"I cant say.
Five years later, in the court room 
of the Old Bailey in London, a young 
Frenchman was on trial for His life. 
Near 1dm sat an untidy looking Indi
vidual by the name of Sydney Carton. 
With his eyes fixed on the celling, he 
was unobservant, apparently, of all 
that: passed around him; but It was he, 
who, first noticing the extraordinary 
resemblance between the prisoner and 
himself, rescued Charles Darnay from 
the web of deceit which had been spun 
around 1dm.
Between these two young men, the 
striking resemblance was in outward 
appearance only. Charles Darnay was 
of noble birth; but ids ancestors had 
for many years so cruelly oppressed 
the French peasantry that the name of 
Evremonde was hated and despised. 
Wholly unlike them in character, this 
last descendant of his race had given 
up his name and estate, and had come
to England as a pr: ite gentleman, 
eager to begin life anew.
Sydney Carton was' a young English 
lawyer, brilliant in intellect, but stead
ily deteriorating through his life of 
dissipation, able to advise others but 
unable to guide himself, conscious of 
the blight on him and resigning him.eelf to let It eat him away.
He and Darnay soon became fre
quent visitors at the small house in 
Bobo square, the home of Dr. Manette 
and bis;daughter. Through Lucies 
care, and devotion, the Doctor had al
most wholly recovered from the effects 
of his long imprisonment, and It was 
only in times of strong excitement that 
any trace of his past Insanity could be 
detected. The sweet face of Lucie 
Manette soon won the hearts of both 
the young mem but it was Darnay to 
whom she gave her love.
And so that Interview between Lucie 
and Sydney Carton has a pathos that 
wrings our hearts. He knew that even 
if his love could have been returned, it 
tvouid have added only to his bitter
ness and sorrow, for he felt it would 
have been powerless to lift him from 
the slough of Selfishness and Sensu
ality that had engulfed him. But he 
could not resist this last sad confes
sion of his love; and when she weeps 
at the sorrow of which she has been 
the innocent cause, he Implores: Do 
not weep, dear Miss Manette; the life
I lead renders me unworthy of your 
pure love. My last supplication is this: 
Think now and then that there is a 
man who would give his life to keep 
a-life you love beside you.
But dark days were to come. In the 
year 1789 the downtrodden French 
peasantry turned upon their oppres
sors. The streets of Paris were filled 
with crowds of people whose eager 
cry was for blood. Madame Defarge 
no longer sat behind the counter of her 
small wine shop, silently knlttlhg into 
her work the names of her hated 
enemies, but axe in hand and knife at 
her belt, headed a frenzied mob of 
women on to the Bastlie. The French 
Revolution had actually begun.'
Madame Defarge was one of the 
leading spirits of the Revolution. 
Early In life she had seen, her family 
fall victims to the tyranny and lust of 
the cruel nobility and from that time 
her life had been devoted to revenge.
Three years df crime and bloodshed 
passed, and in 1792 Mr. Jarvis Lorry 
and Charles Darnay landed In Paris, 
the former to protect the French 
branch of Tellson & Co., and the latter 
;t.|) befriend an old family servant who 
had besought his help. Not until they 
nud set foot in Paris did they realize 
Into what a caldron of fury they had 
plunged. Mr. Lorry, on account of his 
business relations, was allowed his 
freedom, but Darnay was hurried at 
once to the prison of La Force, there 
:o await his trial. The reason given 
Cor the outrage was the new law for 
the arrest - of all returning French 
?mlgrants, but the true cause was that 
lie had been recognized as Charles 
Evremonde.
These tidings soon reached London, 
and Dr. Manette, with Ills daughter 
Lucie, hastened to Paris, for he felt 
fcure that his long confinement In the 
Bastlie would win for him the sym
pathy of the French people, and thus 
enable him to save his sou-in-law. 
Days and months passed, and although 
the Doctor succeeded in gaining a 
promise that. Darnays life should be 
Spared, the latter was not allowed to 
leave. Ills prison.
At lyst came the dreadful year of 
the Reign of Terror. The sympathy 
which at first had been given to Dr. 
Manette had become weakened through 
the Influence of the bloodthirsty 
Madame Defarge. Also, there had been 
ft>un.d In the ruins of the Bastlie a pa
per which contained Dr., Manettes ac
count of his own abduction and im
prisonment, and pronouncing a solemn 
mrse upon He House of Evremonde! 
and their descendants, who were de
clared to be the authors of his eighteen 
years of misery. Charles Darnays 
doom was sealed. Back to the Conclergerie and death within twenty-four 
hours.
To Sydney Carton, who had followed 
his friends to Paris, came an Inspira
tion. Had he not promised Lucie that 
he would die to save a life she loved? 
By bribery, he gains admittance to the 
prison; Darnay is removed unconscious 
from the cell, and Carton sits down to 
await his fate.
Along the Paris streets six tum
brils are carrying the days'wine to la 
guillotine. In the third car sits a young 
man with his hands bound. As the 
cries from the street arise against him 
they only move him to a quiet smile as 
he shakes more loosely his hair about 
his face.
Crash! A-head is held up and the 
knitting women who are ranged about 
the scaffold count One.
The third cart comes up and the sup
posed Evremonde descends. His lips 
move, forming the .words, Ma life you 
love.
The murmuring of many voices, the 
upturning of many faces, then, all 
Hashes away.
Twenty-three!
I am the resurrection and the life, 
salth the Lord; he that bellevetli in 
me, though he were dead, yet shall he 
live; and whosoever llveth and belleveth In me shall never die.

in charge of a Scout Camp in the 
Allegheny Mountains, attended) the 
four weeks Teachers Course given by 
the Westinghouse Electric and Manu
facturing Co. The course was at
tended by twelve teachers from tech
nical schools in eleven states, includ
ing California and Florida. The 
course was a success from every as-, 
pect, both from the point of view of 
the instruction and the colloquiums, 
where were exchanged the ideas from 
the widely separated schools.
From August 14 to August 24 Mr. 
Donnell attended the Officers Train

camp was voluntary, Congress having 
made no appropriation for calling the 
reserves for active service training, 
there were in attendance nearly three 
hundred reserve officers of all grades 
up to and including a brigadier gen
eral. The time was very profitably 
spent in intensive instruction and in 
witnessing demonstrations given by 
the various arms of the service.
Mr. G. McC. Porter spent a month 
with the Union Gas and Electric Co., 
Cincinnati, on the installation of No.

Neville, Techs Number 2 man, and 
captain-elect for this coming season.
This years tournament should bring 
out as brilliant players, for there are 
a number of men in school from last 
year who showed wonderful ability as 
tennis players and yet did not win 
their letter, thereby making them eli
gible for play in this years tourney.
Tennis tournament is the one best 
method of developing ones game. It 
gives an opportunity to get accustom
ed to match play; it gives one an op
portunity to play against good play
ers, and above all, it gives you the 
thrill that only comes to a player play
ing to win against a man playing to 
win also. All prospective tennis play
ers, whether you are good, fair, or 
poor, should enter this tournament. If 
you think you have a chance to win 
the tournament, there is in itself rea
son enough to play. If you think you 
only have a ghost of a chance; or no 
chance at all, enter any way, because 
in every tournament, nine-tenths of 
the men entered are not entered with 
any hope of ultimate victory, but only 
for the experience and the chance to 
play against good players, for after all 
it is experience that counts.
The entrance list will be closed on 
Thursday night, and drawing made at 
that time, so all men must enter their 
names before that date. Your name 
can be handed in in Graduate Mana
ger Haarens office at any time of the 
day prior to that date.
A silver loving cup will be present
ed to the winner, and the follow-up 
man. This cup is a worthy reward 
for the winner, and should be fought 
hard for.

CANDIDATES FOR FOOTBALL
Although this years football squad is one of the largest in the history 
of Tech. there is still chance for those men who have not as yet come ou.t 
for the team.
Graduate Manager Haaren has issued another call for candidates and the 
men interested are requested to call at his office.
Attention is also called, at this time, to the Cross Country team. It is 
desired that all men who have ability along this line come out for the team 
at an early date. There is great need for men in this squad and those wish
ing to try out are urged to get in touch immediately with the graduate 
manager.
A POST SEASON INTER-SECTIONAL GAME
Techs football schedule this season is an excellent one, but rather con
fined in its extent, including teams only in the immediate vicinity of the 
Smoky City. Would it not be an innovation to schedule a post season 
game with one of the southern college's, making this a truly iutersectional 
contest?
It should not be a difficult task to arrange a game of this type with one 
of the leading schools of the southern states. Alabama University, Georgia 
Tech, Georgia University, Vanderbilt or the University of Tennessee might 
any of them be approached for a gamo.
This extension of Techs athletic program should tend to make Carnegie 
better known, not only in the south but in all other sections, as well.

until a few weeks ago. Everybody was 
making money. Now the tide no longer%uns so strong. In some Industries, 
factories have closed or are operating 
on part time. Detroit, one of the won
der cities of the lust decade, now finds 
Itself, according to statements of the 
board of trade and of Mayor James 
CoiK/ens, with 00,000 men out of work. 
And yet there are good jobs that go 
begging. Out of 205 jobs at street 
cleaning, paying $0 a day, and garbage 
collecting, paying $0.50, only eight were 
accepted, said the mayor. The un
employed apparently dont want jobs; 
they want positions. The most hon
orable thing In life Is work. Indeed, 
work is life, says Leslies. Cleaning 
streets or collecting garbage may not 
be to ones liking, but It is a good deal 
more creditable for a man to take -such 
a job than through idleness permit 
himself and those dependent upon him 
to suffer.

Engineers Seek UniformBoiler Law
Those who were here last year do 
not need to be told of the Rifle Club. 
For the bonefit of the Plebes we will 
give a brief history of the organiza
tion.
In the beginning of last year a new 
club was organized at Tech. This 
club had for its aims the promotion of 
marksmanship among the students. 
Considerable interest ws taken by 
the students in the club, and by the 
first of January, 1921, the club became 
affiliated with the National Rifle As
sociation with a charter membership 
of 125.
The Eighteenth Regiment Armory 
range was leased by the elub and 
many a bulls eye was hit by the en
thusiastic members and many a shot 
which would, otherwise have been ob
scure was developed from the mem
bership.
Entirely separate and distinct from 
the club was the lifle team. The team 
representing the school In intercol
legiate competition drew* most of its 
members from ' the Rifle Club but 
there were also men on the team who 
did not affiliate themselves with the 
club.
The team had a successful season. 
Out of 37 colleges competing Tech 
came in eighth in the National Rifle 
Association Intercollegiate meet. In 
the dual meets, Tech beat Colgate. 
Harvard and Columbia, while it was 
forced to bow to Princeton and Drexel.
During the  summer John G. Byler, 
representing Tech, made second placo 
at Camp Humphrey. Manager OCon
nor is at present busy making out an 
attractive schedule for the coming 
season. The team range, which is sit
uated in the College of Fine Arts 
building, has been improved during 
the summer and will be able to ac
commodate many more men.
An intorblass competition will bo 
held early In November for the pur
pose of bringing out the good shots. 
It behooves every one to enter this 
competition. Freshmen are especial
ly urged to go out for the competition.
A meeting of the club will bo hold 
early next week. The time and place 
will -be announced on the bulletin 
boards. Freshmen are especially in
vited to come. No previous riflo ex
perience is necessary to join the club, 
and the experience you get in the club 
may, and undoubtedly will, help you 
to make the team.

ADVERTISE AND GET RESULTS
F
AILURE to regulate the steam 
boiler has cost the United States 
thousands of lives and millions of 
dollars, according to a statement Issued 
by the American Society of Mechan
ical Engineers, which, through Its 
boiler code committee, is seeking to 
bring about uniform standards in this 
country. The statement: pointed out 
that 20 states are joining in a nation
wide movement to lessen the Industrial 
accidents by eliminating the dangers 
that lie hidden in the steam boiler, 
called by engineers, more dangerous 
than dynamite.
In the boiler code of the Ameri
can Society of Mechanical Engineers 
the country has a standard worthy of
general acceptance, said the state
ment. If all boilers were' made in 
accordance to well-known principles, 
boiler explosions would be of rare 
occurrence.
In an effort to secure the univer
sal adoption of this code in this coun
try the Uniform Boiler Law society 
has_been organized and has done a 
great deal more good than shows In 
the lists of states and municipalities 
that have actually adopted the code, 
In promulgating an understanding of 
It und creating a sentiment In Its fa
vor that will result In a rapid falling 
into line of the remaining states when 
the line is a little more pronouncedly 
established.
The Statement Indicated that the 
National Board of Boiler ami Pressure 
Vessel Inspectors Is working on sev
eral problems designed to preclude 
holler explosions. These Include an 
interstate inspection and the stamplug of boilers by the manufacturers. 
The latter plan Is Intended primarily 
to keep a record of a boiler from the 
time It leaves the manufacturing plunt 
until it is scrupped.

never forget my second campus week 
trip and intend to be there for them 
all, but in the meantime, thdre is foot
ball and I just must be with the boys 
for their first game, so look for me 
September 24th.
This is the kind of spirit every

The man whose courage and foresight 
gave alternating eurrcnt to America, 
and founded the Westinghouse industries.
George ^festinghouse
Thirty years ago the alternating current 
system was but an infant, for whose life those 
who believed in it were fighting daily and 
nightly battles; today this same system is a 
giant of almost inconceivable size, so capable 
of defending itself that no one seeks to attack 
it. For 95% of the electricity that is gener
ated and transmitted today is alternating 
current.
The story of the development of alternating 
current is a story of courage and vision and 
iaith; of misunderstanding and misrepresen
tation; of engineering failures and triumphs; 
of commercial ability and organization. It 
reads like a classic romance. In its chapters 
are credit and honor for all who have deserved 
it, but the central figure, the man whose 
motives and acts furnished the basis of the 
plot, was George Westinghouse, the founder 
of the Westinghouse Industries.
When, in 1886, he brought over from 
Europe the crude Gaulard and Gibbs system, 
even he, great as was his foresight, did not 
dream of the coming magnitude of the idea 
which he was fostering. The development 
work undertaken by the strong engineers 
whom he put to work led at first into many 
serious differences with those who favored 
direct current. Legislatures were even impor
tuned to prevent the use of the deadly 
Westinghouse Current, as many extremists 
described it.
That the little 50 horsepower generators of 
those days have grown to sizes twro thousand 
times as large; that stations of a few horse
power have been succeeded by stations with 
a capacity of hundreds' of thousands of horse
power, while at the same time, distribution 
voltages have grown from 1,000 to 220,000, 
is due largely to the vision and the courage of 
George Westinghouse, and to the qualities 
of the engineers whom he called, character
istically, to help him. By no means the least 
of the achievements of this, man was his 
ability to organize the greatest aggregation of 
engineering intelligence ever known, men of 
analytical ability, consummate mathema
ticians, great inventors; and to promote in 
this great group the most harmonious and 
intelligent co-operation.
The same energy and courage and purpose 
that forced the acceptance of the air brake, 
the modern systems for the economic and safe 
distribution of natural gas, and later of the 
steam turbine, led and won the fight for alter
nating current, which has grown to be one of 
the worlds greatest and most necessary 
commodities.
