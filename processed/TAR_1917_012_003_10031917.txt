ARMY GAME WILL BE DIFFICULT TEST; 
BOTH TECH TEAMS HAVE HARD SEASON
Second Team to bs Coached 
By Scroggs of 
Lehigh
GOOD SCHEDULE
A schedule and a coachassistant 
to Coach Steffenhave been obtained 
for a second football team. Negotia
tions have been pending for some time 
for a second coach, and several men 
have been mentioned for the position, 
among them Red Fleming, former 
W. & J. man. However, the choice 
finally rested upon Scroggs, an old 
Lehigh star, and he was on hand Mon
day to assist Coach Steffen in the af
ternoons work. Scroggs for the pres
ent is to be general assistant, and 
once the squad has been separated 
be will have charge of the second 
team.
Considerable difficulty has arisen 
from the men who started out with 
the squad; but have not been show
ing up for practice. Men are needed 
for the second team for which a fine 
schedule has .been arranged. Al
though the second team schedule suf
fered as well as that of the varsity 
from the war, several good games are 
assured, and others are pending. 
Among the teams to be played are 
Kiski, Erie High at Erie and Indiana 
Normal. The schedule will be pub
lished later. These teams are of 
good average caliber. Last Saturday 
Kiski held W. & J. with their two hun
dred pound line to a 17 to 7 score and 
really outplayed W. & J. Men who 
bave any interest in football should 
come out for this, as future varsity 
material can be developed in this way.

M. M. C.S. GUILD DANCE PROVES GREAT SUCCESS
The social activities of Tech began 
auspiciously with the Margaret Mor
rison Guild Dance in Carnegie Union 
on Friday, September 28. Abour 
ninety couples were present and 
everyone thoroughly enjoyed greeting 
old friends as well as meeting new 
ones, for a goodly number of Piebes 
attended. The snappy, spirited music 
furnished by our old standby, Gus 
Schnabel, and a violinist, kept the 
crowd moving from nine until one 
oclock. Punch was served on the 
landing.
About ninety dollars has been 
turned into the Guild treasury. Miss 
Rachel Beatty, president of the Guild, 
Miss Lorene Friedman and Miss Mar
garet Hollar deserve unlimited credit 
for the good start-off they gave the 
Guild year as well as giving to so 
many Techites such a fine opportunity 
for an enjoyable evening.

LINEUP TO BE ANNOUNCED SOON
SEATS FOR FOOTBALL GAMES TO BE RESERVED
Drawings were made Saturday for 
the annual Open Fall Tennis Tourna
ment from a list of forty-four en
trants. According to the original plan 
an entry fee of fifteen, cents was to 
have been charged. However, when 
only twenty men responded, the fee 
was eliminated.and as a result the 
number of entries was more than 
doubled and some fast matches may 
be anticipated from so large a field of 
contenders.
Among the entries are men who 
have starred for various Prep and 
High School teams. Some of the 
PlebeB,. in particular,. have .shown ex
cellent form on the courts. Several 
upper classmen who have had consid
erable experience at the game, but 
have not previously tried.out for the 
team, are also entered. This tourna
ment should give a. fair line as to the 
ability of the men who are to compose 
the Tennis' Team in the spring.
The prospects for a good tennis 
team are brighter than in most of the 
other branches of sport. Toots 
Davis, last years captain; Beatty and 
Kossler have returned to school; thus 
leaving Turk Steens position alone 
to be filled. , This tournament "will 
probably indicate largely the men ca
pable of filling this opening.. To com
pare the playing of the new men with 
the 1917 varsity, Manager Hirsch has 
arranged to have the two men reach
ing the finals, play Davis and Beatty.
Manager Hirsch and his assistants 
worked Saturday to place the courts 
in condition. Play in the preliminary 
round will start Monday, if the weath
er permits. With so many matches 
scheduled, some will be played every 
afternoon. It js hoped that these will 
be well attended by the student body.
This year a new system of reserved 
seats is to be instituted for the foot
ball season. The present grandstand 
is to be divided into three sections 
left, center and right. The center sec
tion is to be fenced off from the other 
two sections with gateways left where 
ushers will be stationed. Since this 
section contains the best seats, it will 
be reserved for seventy-five cents, or 
fifty cents with student book. The left 
and right sections will also be re
served at fifty cents, or twenty-five 
cents with student book. In both these 
cases student books and season A. A. 
books are positively not good at the 
gate, but the reserved seat coupon 
must have, been exchanged for the re
served seat ticket beforehand at the 
price mentioned. This exchange may 
be made in Manager Gearharts office 
at any time between Wednesday and 
Friday preceeding the game. Game 
passes good only in end sections.
The bleachers on the other side of 
the field will, as in former years, be 
unreserved, admission requiring only 
the student book.
ANNOUNCEMENT
PLEBE DANCE GIVEN BY DRAMA STUDENTS
New Musical Organization 
Formed, Called Dram 
Jazz Band
During the past week Coach Steffen lias been putting the football 
squad through rigorous workouts to harden them for the Army game. 
He has devoted much time in drilling them in the fundamentals, such 
as spilling interference and falling on the ball, as some of the men 
most promising from a physical aspect, have had comparatively little 
experience.
The team will leave Thursday for New York, where they will 
have a final work-out some time Friday. In past years the spirit of 
the Tech student body has been a big fighting asset for the team. 
It is every Tech mans duty to bo out*
Thursday night to give the fellows 
a send-off that they will remember 
wiien they hit the Army team Satur
day.
Indications are that West Point has 
a fine team this fall. The Newf York 
papers characterize the men as "all 
beefy fellows who possess speed along 
with their avoirdupois. Oliphant, 
Walter Camps first all American full 
back of last year, is captain of the 
Army team. He is a fast and hard 
line plunger. This asset coupled with 
his heavy line should severely test 
the mettle of the Tech team.
Coach Steffen has not announced 
who the men are that will mako the 
Army trip. His final choice will de
pend largelj' on the show'ing of the 
men in practice this week. However, 
there can be no doubt as to certain 
of the men. McFeaters, who is to 
captain the team, will undoubtedly 
be there, as will Vet Williams. It 
is also quite safe to guess that Gretzler, who has been practicing at cen
ter, Bloom, Jones and Levinson will 
go. Abe Levy, who was making quite 
a bid for the quarterbacks position, 
has been called to the colors unex
pectedly in the Naval Reserve, and
has consequently been lost. It had 
been rumored that Wheat Lyons, 
last years two hundred pound line
man, was returning to school; but 
this has been definitely dispelled by 
the news that he is to bo married in 
the near future.
The rearrangement of the school 
schedules has enabled the men to be 
out for an hour more of practice oiich 
day. This should givo the Coach a 
much better opportunity of rounding 
the material into a football machine 
of the efficient type which has repre
sented us sinco he took charge of 
Tech football. Last yoara varsity 
manifested the same fighting spirit 
which they showed against Pitt last 
Fall in enlisting last Spring. It is, 
therefore, up to Tech undergraduates 
to support the team in the faco of 
present obstacles
The squad had an unusually stiff 
work out Saturday morning, after 
which their picture was taken. Man
ager Mnnkol is being assisted by 
First Assistant Manager Mills. Neal, 
Campboll, Jennor, Lee, Martin and 
Unsicker are trying out as socond as
sistants.
CHEER THE TEAM!
CDEER LEADER TO BE CHOSEN BY COMMITTEE
The school cheer leader is to be 
chosen at the meeting w'here the re
port of the Army game is to be re
ceived on Saturday afternoon, October
6. The same method of election is to 
be pursued this yar as last. A com
mittee of faculty and students will 
watch the candidates perform that 
afternoon and will mako their choice 
from that. The faculty members will 
be Dr. Esquerre, Mr. McCullocli, Mr. 
Eyman, and Manager Gearhart. The 
student members will bo selected with
out publicity, in order to be absolutely 
fair; there will be one from each 
school.
Of the three candidates, only ono 
has been chosen as yet; that is Pafenbacli, in Science. His assistant is 
Throckmorton. Each of the other 
three schools will select their chiof 
candidate and his assistant at the 
school assemblies on Wednesday

DANCE DATE CHANGED
ARMY GAME WILL BE REPORTED AS PLAYED
Following the custom established 
last year, there will bo a meeting in 
Room 209, Sclenco Building, on Sat
urday, October (5, to receive the re
ports of the Army game. A direct 
wire will be obtained and results re
ceived in the room by tolephono. As 
the plays are read oil, the progress of 
the ball back and forth on tlio field 
will bo shown by a diagram on tlio 
blackboard. Tlio reports will prob
ably not bogin to arrive until a half 
hour after tho gamo starts; conse
quently the exact timo for tho begin
ning of the mooting cannot bo an 
nounced until lator in tho week, when 
notlcoB will bo posted. In tho inter
vals betwoen reports tho throo candi
dates for choor-loador will altornato 
at leading cheers, and a commlttoo of 
faculty and students will select tho 
chiof.
Admission to tho room will bo by 
student book, or porhaps a small foo 
for outaldora. As largo a crowd Is oxpectod this yoar as there was last 
yoar, and perhaps larger.
Through the agency of The Tartan, 
arrangements have been made to car
ry out the plan of Mr. Saunders, man
ager of the Schenley Theatre, where
by the players of the home and visit
ing team will be given tho stage boxes 
on the evening of the first home game. 
The football dance originally schedul
ed for that evening has been moved 
forward to Friday evening, in the 
Union as before.
Tho attraction at the theatre on 
the evening of October 13 will bo "The 
Chocolate Soldier." The two teams 
will bo given the boxes, but tho whole 
house is to have a regular Tech night. 
It is expected that a large crowd will 
attend. Tho cheer leader will bo giv
en an opportunity to lead choors and 
tho men will be allowed to raise Cain 
generallywithin reason, of course.
This plan of holding a college night 
at ono of tho local thoa.tros with the 
team as tho guests of tho thoatro has 
always been productivo of a great 
deal of pop. Tho atmosphere of the 
thoatro seoms to pull the men togother 
ovon more than an actual gamo. The 
gathering, coming as it doos at the 
first of tho season, should liavo a 
splendid offoct. upon tho spirit of tho 
student body for tho remaining gamos.
Tho football dance comos on tho 
preceding ovonlng, Friday, Octobor 12, 
In tho Union. As in formor years 
these dances are for tho bonoflt of 
tho team and have always attracted a 
largo crowd.
The football team leaves the Union Station at 9:30 Thuradap 
evening. Every man in school should be tliero to givo the team 
a royal send-off. As much depends upon the spirit which the student 
body can instill into the men as upon the tochnical knowledgo which 
they possess.
Furthermore, the team will return at 9:30 Sunday morning. The 
same process! Last year there were enough men at the station to 
form two linos between which the men of the returlnng team marched. 
And that is win or losethere is no difference!

Friday evening, in the Green Room 
of the Theater, the upper-classmen of 
the Department of Dramatic Arts en
tertained the incoming class with an 
informal dance. Most of the upperclass attended, but a few of the Piebes, 
owing to the short notice on which the 
party was arranged, were unable to 
attend. However, the ones that did, 
enjoyed themselves to the limit. '
The feature of the evening was the 
Dram Jazz Band, an entirely new 
musical organization which sprung up 
almost over night. It consisted of a 
piano, violin, traps, and a new instru
ment, the name of which could not be 
learned. It consisted of a row of bot
tles and tin pans hung upon a rack. 
As far as the musical qualities of this 
instrument are concerned, the least 
said the better, but it without doubt 
succeeded in its purposethat of put
ting Jazz into the music.
The members of the band deserve 
worthy mention for their finished per
formance. They were: Nicholas Hans 
Muller at the piano, George Trabert at 
the violin, Alexander I. Buchanan at 
the drums, and D. Stoner Gaither at 
the bottles.
As the party broke up the Piebes 
gave the upper-classmen a hearty vote 
of thanks, and everyone wrent home 
feeling much better acquainted.
Mr. and Mrs. Beatty were the chap
erones of the evening.
The manager of the band, Mr. Mul
ler, announces that the open dates 
and prices of the band will be fur
nished on request.

MISS BARR PREPARES FOR MISSIONARY WORK
Miss Jean Barr, of last year's Insti

day evening for the Bible Teachers' 
Training School in New York. There 
she is to prepare for missionary work

At a special meeting of the insignia 
men of last years Musical Clubs, held 
last Sunday, the folowing men were 
elected to the executive committee to 
fill the places of the men who did not 
come back to the school this year:
J. J. Pannabaker, Science, 18, was 
elected manager in the place of Ried, 
who has been drafted and will not be 
back this term; L. C. Smith, Design, 
18, was the man elected as assistant 
manager, and George Ellerton, Sci
ence, 19, was designated as publicity 
manager for the coming season.
Next Sunday, October 7, the first 
tryouts for both the Glee and Mandolin 
clubs will be held at the Carnegie 
Union, at 2:30 p. m. All the old men 
are requested to come around, as well 
as the new men wrho wish to try out 
for the clubs. The Piebes who signed

Registration of night students will 
begin tomorrow evening and continue 
on Friday. Although a number of 
personal interviews with incoming 
students have been held, the personal 
interview being a requirement for ad
mission, it is difficult to say just how 
many night students there are to be. 
It is rather expected that night regis
tration will probably follow the ten
dencies shown in day registration,
In the Science school the aim of 
the regular night courses is to give 
young men who are connected with 
the industrial concerns the technical 
instructions necessary to equip them 
for engineering work. Regular courses 
leading to a diploma are offered in 
the night school in the different 
branches of engineering.
In the M. M. C. S. the night school 
is primarily for students who are em
ployed during the day, and its work

SCIENCE PROFESSORS DO GOVERNMENT WORK
Prof. Grondahl Receives Cap
tains Commission Prof. Da
visson on Leave of Absence
The Physics Department of tho 
School of Applied Science during tho 
past summer has taken an active part 
in problems arising during the present 
war. The work was purely of a re
search nature and some fo the new 
things, if put into service, will surely 
bring a quick end to the war.
Prof. Hower was engaged the whole 
summer, except three weeks, in light 
research work. His work consisted 
mainly in designing new lights, in
cluding searchlights and blinker 
lights, the latter for the new signal 
system for the navy, a new form of 
diffusing trench lights and a periscope 
trench light.
Prof. Davisson is at present working 
for the American Telegraph Company 
on work which may be of very great 
importance in the war. He will be ab
sent on leave for 1917-18.
Prof. Grandahl has received a cap
tains commission in Lhe Ordnance 
Department and has received notice 
that he is called for active service next 
, week; he has been working on import
ant work in Baltimore,

Members of the Faculty and of the 
Senior class of M. M. C. S. have been

knit army socks.
The guests will meet at 3:30 on 
Tuesday afternoon in the faculty par

the intricacies of purling in order 
to have their first lesson.
Twenty-seven secretarial girls have 
already signed up to sit In department

The girls will give one-half day for 
three consecutive Saturdays.
SENIORS ENTERTAIN FACULTY AND PLEBES
Registration up to October, 1, at 
Tech allows a marked docroaso ovor 
formor yoars. In comparison with 
last yoar the Scionco School has Tallon 
from (02 to <131, Industries from 303 
to 228, Design from 339 to 274, while 
M. M. C. S. has risen from 281. to 292. 
The Instltuto as a whole has only
1,255 day student as compared with
1,020 last year. That this effort lias 
been found all ovor the country is 
brought out by the following article 
taken verbatim from the Electrical 
World:
From the Electrical World.
That students and faculties of the 
universities of the country responded 
nobly to the national call when war 
was declared is now well known. The 
extent which the engineering colleges 
have been affected has beon the sub
ject of an investigation by the Elec
trical World.
Reports were received from sixtytwo engineering schools or engineer
ing departments of universities as to 
the opening date, percentage of at
tendance expected, number of faculty 
absent and curriculum adjustments 
necessitated. It was found that the 
opening date extended anywhere from 
September 3 to October 10, the most 
popular time being the week ending 
September 22.
The reports show conclusively that 
the enrollment in engineering studies 
this fall will be considerably reduced. 
Out of fifty-one replies giving figures, 
only seven expect a 100 per cent at
tendance, while two expect one as low 
as 50 per cent. The others were di
vided as follows: Thirteen, 90 per
cent; ten, 80 per cent; nine, 7^ Per 
cent; four, 85 per cent; three, 00 per 
cent, and three. 70 per cent. It is safe, 
therefore, to say that the attendance 
will on the whole be from 10 to 25 per 
cent diminished. That these figures 
are not larger Is owing to what seems 
to be the largest freshman engineer
ing class In history. The upper classes 
have been aovorely depleted In nura(Contlnuod'on Pago Three.)

OUR CHANCE TO HELP 
A Frank Opinion from a Tech Girl
The period of indecision caused by these extraordinary times has 
passed and we arc back at school, settled and hard at work. Even 
though we arc settled with our years work mapped out ahead of us, 
we arc certainly not so engrossed in that work as to forget that there is a 
world-wide war in progressour waryour warand that we luive 
men, both classmates and friends, actually at the front who have 
chosen to do their part of the struggle by realistic fighting; and that 
there arc many more preparing for the same thing. There is left for 
each and every one of us a part of the work to do. Whether we are 
girls, or whether we arc men who have wanted to light and have been 
prevented, or who have chosen to stay in school until the government 
calls us for some other duty, we must not forget that we are a part 
 I' the struggle and Hint a concentration of our willingness lo help 
along some chosen line, will directly help to bring success to our 
country and to her allies.
For Tech students this need not be an indefinite ideal which 
cannot materialize. Our soldiers need knitted articles; already in 
France and in our cantonments themen tire feeling the cold. Hcncc, 
knitting is'not a fad it is an absolute necessity. We, have a Red 
Cross Unit in ('. 1. T., of which Anna McCandless is president. The 
Tech Chapter has purchased yarn lo the amount of three hundred 
and forty dollars. This will lie furnished without chargd, provided 
I hr finished articles sweaters, wrist warmers, scarfstire turned 
into the unit. If you have not learned to knit, learn now; then if you 
arc anxious to help, see Dorothy Davis, of the M. M. ('. S., concerning 
vjirn. All articles made by students for the unit will be sent to ('. 1. T.
1 1 now in service, and only to these men. hater in the year, classes
w i 1 I e organized for garment making and surgical dressings; and 
when t/e call comes for volunteers for that work, you show up.
1 men cannot join either the knitting or the surgical dress
ing units, many opportunities will turn up during the year when they 
can be a help to the unitin financial contributions, or in support to 
activities. The girls feel as though the men could raise part of the 
money to pay for the yarn for the unit, either by smokers, or dances, 
or something similar. Of course the entire Tech Red Cross Chapter 
will hold a dance, but these other affairs might be given separately. 
Also voluntary subscriptions are always acceptable.
These are times when it is especially sinful to waste time. Let 
us be definiteactiveworthwhile. Do not waste time.
DORMITORY MEETING HELD WITHOUT RESULT
A meeting of the dormitory men was 
held last Thursday evening in the In
dustries Building. Prof. Esquerre pre
sided at the gathering, the purpose of 
which was to determine a method of 
student control. None of the solu
tions of the problem that were offered 
could be voted upon, though, as there 
was not a quorum present. However, 
there will be another meeting next 
week, at which it Is hoped the neces
sary number of students will be pres
ent to decide upon a satisfactory solu
tion.
FOOTBALL AGAIN
Since classes have geen moved forward an hour, giving more 
time for practice, since Coach Steffen has had time to do at least start 
the men in rudimentary training, since an assistant coach has been 
obtained and a second team started, football has assumed a more 
promising aspect at Tech: It is true that we are still far from a real 
football team. We must not be so'carried away by the excitement of 
the moment as to be violently disappointed if defeat should come on 
Saturday; yet we are expecting victory, not defeat. Tech spirit has 
done greater things than thisthis is merely a matter of a light, in
experienced team going against a heavy, experienced one. But the 
spirit is essential.
There is a wonderful opportunity to put pep into the team by 
giving them a real send-off when they leave Thursday evening. There 
is an equally good opportunity to greet them when they return Sun
day morning. A good greeting then will help every game during the 
rest of the season.
GRADUATE NOW OFFICES OF MACHINE GUN CORPS
The following letter, telling of the

CHEMICAL DIVISION IN GOVEliNMENT WORK
Professors and Stud=nts Aid 
in Gas Investigation
In last weeks Tartan there was an 
article about Dr. James, of the Chem
istry Department, and his commission 
in the Ordnance Department. He was 
the first of this department to respond 
Lo his countrys call. Although the 
others have not taken commissions, 
which they were strongly urged to do, 
they have been engaged during the 
entire summer in government work.
Dr. Harris started government re
search work some time in May. He 
was later transferred to inspection 
and gas mask work and was located at 
Akron, Ohio, for the remainder of the 
summer.
Mr. Grifiin toop up similar work 
some time later and was stationed at 
Cleveland, Ohio, and was afterwards 
transferred to Easton, Pa. Dr. Alex
ander spent the greater part of the 
summer at the latter place, also.
Mr. Turnock as engaged in re
search work in connection with the 
Bureau of Mines, here in Pittsburgh. 
He was in that work for the greater 
part of the summer.
The students of the Chemical De
partment are also doing their best to 
aid the government. Kuhn and Rock
well, Sophomores, and Gladstein, 
Junior, are with the Bureau of Mines, 
working on the Army and Navy gas 
investigation. These men were in 
Pittsburgh during the summer, but 
are now located at Washington, D. C. 
Bauer, a Junior Chemical, worked on 
the gas investigation during the sum
mer, but returned to school this fall. 
Several other students left school last 
spring are are now doing industrial 
work of government nature.

GENEOAL ASSEMBLY WAS HELD LAST WEDNESDAY
The first general assembly of the 
four schools was held last Wednesday 
morning in the Soldiers Memorial 
building, the Carnegie Music Hall 110* 
being available, because of its being 
remodeled and redecorated.
The students marched down in a 
body. Th length of the line they 
formed gave no indication of the fact 
that registration is below normal.
Director Ilamerschlag spoke of the 
purpose of the general assemblies, 
which will be held each month, and 
assured the students that these meet
ings were theirs as well as the facul
tys, and that student affairs should 
be discussed and announcements made 
at these gatherings. The deans of 
several schools, Dr. Esqerre, and Mr 
Tarbell each spoke a few words, and 
the band lent spirit to the occasion 
by rendering appropriate music in a 
most stirring manner.
COURSE IN PLAYGROUND GAMES OFFERED GIRLS
A one-credit course in games has 
been offered to those M. M. C. S. girls 
who are interested in equipping them
selves for summer playground work. 
The course is to be conducted by Miss 
Coleman. The class meets Thursday 
afternoon from 3:30 to 4:30. The re
quired outside work is to teach a class 
of little children in one of the char
itable institutions of the city games 
and folk dancing. Some of these in
stitutions have no provision for or
ganized: play and this is an oppor
tunity for real service.
The class of setting up exercises 
is to begin Wednesday. If this class 
upsets your schedule dont grumble, 
for, as Dean Breed said, "Remember, 
girls, its for your country."

COACH STEFFEN SPEAKS TO SCIENCE ASSEMBLY
Last Friday at 1:30 the Science 
School held a mass meeting in Room 
209 Science building. Coach Steffen 
was the chief speaker. In his plea 
for men to make up the varsity team, 
he emphasized the fact that eleven 
out of the seventeen men who consti
tuted last years varsity team and 
substitutes have been called to the 
colors. Only three regular men have 
returned. Steffen is positive that the 
material for a first rate team exists 
at Tech, but that the new men espec
ially have not learned the meaning 
of Tech spirit. Seventy suitB have 
been given out to men who thought 
they would like to try for the team, 
but only thirty turn out for practice.

I brief period of tjmo that students can
 give to school work and to outside 
I study. Special subject classes are 
offered in the Night School for those 
students who are not candidates for 
a certificate, degree or similar recog
nition from the institution, but who 
wish to concentrate upon a single sub
ject with a view to increase thoir 
wago earning efficiency.
The School of Applied Industries 
offers courses at night which are in
tended primarily for men who are 
working at a trade, These courses 
are in the nature of continuation 
schools in which men who reside and 
work within a reasonable distance of 
Pittsburgh may be accommodated in

bera. Ono university expects but a 
10 per cent senior attendance, others 
expect as low as a 20 and 30 per cent 
attendance in tho upper classes; few 
report a full senior enrollment.
There is also a depletion in tho 
ranks of the faculty. Only fifteen col
leges out of the sixty-four reporting 
have no members of the faculty ab
sent. The others reported 206 faculty 
members absent, fourteen of whom 
have been replaced.
In the matter of curriculum adjust

military drill and courses. One is re
quiring of all students in engineering 
a course in military engineering, and 
one a course in military geology. One 
is adding a course in practical engi

women cross themselves. Are the Stars and Stripes 3-CA worthy of a 
freeman's honor than the tricolor. Do Americans love and respect their 
countrys flag less than the French republicans love theirs? We hope 
not, and now while there are too many signs of ha'f-hearted demotion 
and divided allegiance, although the nation is plcdqcd before the world 
to a great war, we all ought to join in every act of patriotic ceremony, 
for our own sake and also for the sake of those whose loyalty needs a 
sharp awakening. We are asking men to fi~ht and suffer and perhaps 
die for the Stars and Stripes, as their predecessors have fouqht and 
suffered and died for them in five great wars and many lesser ones. 
We who stand on the curb and watch our defenders march by can afford 
at least to show that we, too, honor the flag.Chicago Tribune.

The following letter, illustrative of 
life in the training camps, has been re
ceived by the Director irom Henry 
Levy, Science, '16:
Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.,
Sept. 15, 1917.
My dear Mr, Hammerschlag:
I thought you might be interested to 
hear from one of your boys who is in 
training to earn a commission in Uncle 
Sams Reserve Army, so I have de
cided to write you a few lines telling 
o our work. At our Alumni Banquet 
in 1916, you gave a talk on National
ism, and well do I remember your 
expressions on that subject Since' 
then I have been trying to do my share 
and as a result, I am today in this 
training camp.
Of course you are familiar with the 
general lay-out for training camps. I 
have selected the Coast Artillery as 
my branch of service. The big guns 
which were formerly used primarily 
for coast defense are expected to be 
used as heavy artillery in the field in 
France.
At present we are undergoing a 
month of intensive infantry training. 
A typical day taken from my diary 
will serve best to illustrate the exact 
nature of the work.

This gives you an exact idea of the 
nature of the work being conducted. 
We are taught actual conditions exist
ing in European fields by French of
ficers and by m.en who have had ex
perience in the trenches No phase of 
modern warfare is omitted and every 
cadet (that is our ranking) Is taught 
how to uso the bayonet, the grenade 
iiml the rifle. In a recent practice 
lire, on the gallarey, 1 shot a 47 out of 
a possible 50, which in not so bad, con
sidering that I am a raw beginner, 
with no previous experience. The one 
thing which 1 regret today Is the fact 
that during-:my course at Tech I never 
had any drill or military training. I 
believe that such a course should be 
made compulsory for all future stu
dents.
There are quite a few Tech, men in 
tills camp, about 30 iu number. I be
lieve. Among them are McCorkle, 
your former secertary; Goorge Blair, 
Aclieson and MacMillan, who were 
well known in our athletics at Tech; 
Ed Crump. Wilson (Design School). 
Cogswell, Ingalls and Eeinstein. The 
Coast Artillery (composed mostly of 
engineers^ probably has the largest 
representation,
Things are being conducted down 
here in the best possible manner. In 
spite of the hard, continuous grind, 
the work is pleasant and eujoyable. 
We, the Tech men, are all hoping to 
get commissions and bring further 
honor to the school which lias done so 
much to train and fit us for the pres
ent emergency.
I am feeling fine and am enthusias
tic, about. the work. I am wrapped up 
in it in the same manner in which' I 
would be in some new branch of ath^ 
letics. I hope my enthusiasm and wil
lingness will help overcome my inex
perience and that I am able to earn a 
commission.
I believe this camp illustrates rather 
clearly the principle that this war will 
make a united America. Everyone 1 
down here is just crazy to go to France | 
to fight for America, justice and denii 
oerae.y And everyone is helping the j 
other, even though there is sort of a j 
spirit of competition.
After Friday, the 20th. avo leave for ! 
Fortress Monroe, Virginia, to get our! 
final training in handling the big guns: j 
Ilere we. will bo under the instruction 
of Regular Army officers. At the pres-1 
ent camp, most of the instructors have 
been I'. S. Reserves from the first 
camps.
1 hope 1 have not burdened you by 
this too long letter. I could write in
definitely, but time does not permit.
Willi best wishes to you, all my 
friends of the faculty and to the stu
dent body, I am
Very respectfully,
HENRY LEVY.
My address after Sept. 20, will be: 
Seventh A. A. C.,
R. O. T. C., 
Fortress Monroe, 
Virgina.

"Curly Lauer, captain of the 1915 
football team, was one of the first 
men to volunteer for the Aviation 
Corps. He stood among the highest 
ten of the first eighty men who were 
examined at Cornell. In one letter 
Lauer stated that so far as he knew 
every Tech man who had tried for the 
corps, both in America and abroad, 
had passed successfully. This letter 
to his parents will be of interest to 
football men:
Queens College, Oxford, 
Friday, Sept. 7, 1917. 
Dear Mother and Dad:
We finally landed at Liverpool and 
the same night left for London.
Two or three of us stayed at the 
Waldorf. The rest at what they call 
the Cottage, which is nothing more j 
or less than a branch of the Y. M. C. 
A., a new building erected to take 
care of the soldiers and sailors. They 
treated us something fine. Had a reg
ular American soda fountain there and 
its the only one in England, I believe, 
that compares with ours. You should 
have seen our gang wade into it. Its 
the cheapest and best place to eat in 
London.  I cant figure out how they 
can serve the meals they do for the 
prices.
Left London for Oxford and we are 
now at Queens College, Oxford Uni
versity. Dont know how long well be 
here, but from the looks of things, 
well go through their ground school 
here.
The young Britishers here are siive 
a fine lot of fellows and they welcomed 
us with open arms.
First day here we went to the 
Queens College sports field (same as 
our athletic fields) and found a soccer 
game and a Rugby football game go
ing on between the cadets from Braznells College and Queens. The Rugby 
gang needed two more men on each 
side and Wanted to know if any of us 
would play. Nig Koons and I played 
for Braznells and two other fellows 
for Queens. It was the most fun I've 
had for a long time. Its a lot different 
from our game; you kick the ball, run 
with it and pass it only always towa 1 
your own goal, never forward. There 
seems to be no rulesyou can do 
everything but bite. About four min
utes after the game started (you play 
two 20-minute halves), while I was 
still' feeling' fresh, I got a good op a 
smack at a fellow running with the 
ball. He was one surprised gentle
man, believe me. They dont tackl 
nearly so hard or low as our gaq  
seeming to prefer to climb on and 
ride. Jack Walker got In the gam 
in the second half on the other sid 
and had the hard luck to get Ills ankle 
broken. Nig Koons tackled him 
theres the reason. I-Ies across tin1 
street in the hospital now. The cap
tain of the Queens team said after the 
game, Give you Americans three 
practises and youll beat any team in 
England. The final score was 3 
one touchdown apiece.
Nig and I are established now as 
pair of rough-necks, I guess, for next 
day one of the Britishers confided in 
Frank* Platt. He pulled Frank aside 
and asked, Who is that chap over 
there?" Frank told him it was Im, 
and he said: Thats one of the two 
samples of football players you sent 
us yesterday, wasnt it? Frank said, 
Yes; what do you think of them?1 
The Britishers made him laugh his old 
head off, for he said: They're both
blasted good playersbut they are 
dam rough. Neither of us were in 
shape, nor did very much, so it amused 
us a lot Id like to play the game 
more and get on to it, _for its sure a 
good one and the fellows that play it 
are a darned good lot The same class 
of fellows that we were with at Cor
nell, only considerably younger. The 
finest looking lot of men you can imag
ine, not facial appearance, but just 
clean-cut men, through and thrpugh, 
_are the Australians. London is full of 
them; Australians, New Zealanders, 
Canadians, and quite a few of our own 
boys. Most of the Americans seem to 
hang out at the Y.
This is the quaintest and prettiest, 
place I ever hope to see. The build
ings are mostly all stone and old as 
the hills It just seems like the things 
Ive read about and always wanted to 
see are coming true to life Wonderful 
old stone churches, court yards, etc. 
Everything seems more interesting 
than the last.
Nig and I went punting on the 
Thames yesterday in one of their old 
two-nozed punts. Im glad we did, but 
its a lazy mans job and never could 
interest you for long
The afternoon we spent in London 
we went t:o the American Embassy, 
got paid, and then some of us took in 
Westminster Abbey I could have 
spent a week in the Abbey alone and 
enjoyed every minute of it Visited 
the poets corner and its well worth 
visiting You dont want to miss it or 
Oxford.
We are quartered here in the old 
students of Queens dormitory. The 
dorms are arranged in a quadrangle 
and are all older than the hills, stone 
and covered with English ivy so thick 
you can't imagine its possiblebut 
there it is, in front of you.
Across the quadrangle from our 
room is Queens Library, containing
