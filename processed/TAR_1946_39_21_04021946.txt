Liberty, equality, iraternity, 
sorority* and mens dorm council 
was the war-cry of 1400 enraged 
students as they took over the 
campus of Carnegie Tech this 
morning. Plans for the insurrec
tion had been made late the night 
before at the historic emergency 
meeting of Techs Interfraternity 
Council after the surprise ap
pearance of Dr. Rumpty H. Coo 
(E 31). After the meeting the 
various fraternity representatives 
Were sent back to their houses to

Old Rump the nickname given 
to Dr. Coo (E 31) by his follow
ers.
The Tau Delts were assigned to 
sabotage Techs transportation 
system with a few well-placed 
car-bombs. The SAEs decided to 
camouflage themselves as pigeons 
in order to take the campus by 
surprise, and immediate construc
tion was begun on a synthetic 
feather machine. But the machine 
exploded during the night, and 
four SAE's were tickled to death.

Yon Elopes With 
A(morous) Binder
At 4:00 on the morning of 
March 32 at the Greeks, Jessie 
Yuille Yon and August E. Binder, 
Jr., were united in holy matri
mony. Minister Bob Honest presided^The news came as a com
plete surprise to the many friends 
of both the bride and groom.
The happy couple eloped from 
the Carnegie Union at 3:00 A. M. 
They escaped in the PiKA lim-ousine which Mr. Binder had stolen.
At the ceremony the bride wore 
a charming black dress which 
reached to her ankles. On her 
head was a lovely black and white 
nuns cap. The groom wore tan 
trousers and a gray sweater with 
a plaid C upon it. He was so nerv
ous during the ceremony that he 
was continually playing with his 
key chain.
Mrs. Binder, who has our sincerest sympathy, is a product of 
Yale University. Mr. Binder is a 
member of Kappa Kappa Gamma 
as well as Tau Beta Pi and Pi 
Delta Epsilon, though he failed 
by one vote to gain admission to 
Kappa Alpha Theta. He made 
quite a name for himself as an 
active student at Carnegie Tech; 
in fact it was while he was a stu
dent there that he fell in love with 
and wooed the fair Jessie.
The happy couple after discuss
ing such places as Bermuda and 
California decided to spend their 
honeymoon in the furnace room of 
Machinery Hall. They said it 
brought back memories.
Fund of $350,000 
Given Sororities
The Administration has just 
granted the sororities of Carnegie 
Tech campus $350,000 with which 
to build sorority houses. The Ad
ministration as represented by the 
inimitable Dr. Rumpty H. Coo, the 
President, said and I quote: The 
school has accumulated so much 
money through the Endowment 
Fund that it can afford to try to 
give its students increased oppor
tunity for better social life. We 
feel that our campus is sadly lack
ing in such facilities even when 
compared with such inferior 
schools as Pitt. We hope that this 
gesture, the first in a series, will 
indicate our change in policy from 
emphasis on scholastic to emphasis 
on the social phases of life on Car
negie campus. Social, that is.
The school has donated ground 
in the center of Schenley Park 
oval for the erection of the new 
houses. They feel that this plot 
of ground is far enough removed 
from Mrs. Yons office and abode 
to afford the proper social atmos
phere which the school hopes to 
foster. The new houses are to be 
designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. 
No provision is being made for 
quarters for house mothers, for the 
administration (again President 
Rumpty is the spokesman) feels 
that girls who are old and mature 
enough to come to college are old 
enough to take care of themselves.
The new houses are to be sump
tuous establishments. They will 
provide room and bath for each 
[continued on page 4.]
DUs were drowned while trying 
to cross the Cut.
Some Beta Sig pledges were 
sent out to mobilize Scobell, Welch 
and Henderson Halls in the fight 
against the administration. Just as 
the Mens Dorm Council called a 
torch-light mass meeting of their 
men in front of the Carnegie Inn, 
Slim Langdon noticed that one 
of the shades was up in Birch 
Hall, and ninety-five young vali
ants were killed in the mad 
scramble for a telescope. The 
agonized screams of the wounded 
dorm men woke up Mrs. Barr, belpved home mother at McGill 
Hall, who immediately called up 
Honest Bob Doherty to warn 
him of the awful doom which 
awaited him.
At dawn, the insurgents opened 
the attack, but Honest Bob was 
ready for them. With the help of 
the Loyalist faculty, he had set up 
defenses in Industries, Machin
ery and Engineering Halls, as well 
as the Arts building. Maggie 
Murph, however, had been taken

Dr. Johnstone 
Installs Reforms 
For Fine Arts
Dr. Johnstone, Director of Fine 
Arts School, having discussed the 
students grievances and problems 
with them, has decided to effect a 
number of changes and improve
ments in the school. The recent 
nucleus of the troubles has been 
the elevator. After riding up and 
down in it for three days, after 
being jammed and suffocated in 
an airless corner, after suffering 
three broken ribs from paint 
boards and a fractured big toe 
when a sophomore dropped his 
paint box, and finally after being 
stranded between the first and 
second floors with Mr. Readio for 
two unforgettable hours, Director 
Johnstone has issued a statement 
that the elevator is antiquated and 
dangerous. As soon as equipment 
is available, escalators will be in
stalledthe up-side on the north 
and the down-side on the south.
Other improvements decided 
upon are: installation of coke ma
chines on all floors; remodelling of 
the fourth and fifth floors includ
ing a roof garden; a new system of 
grading in which the students re
view, approve, and revise the 
grades given by the faculty upon 
whom the entire task of grading 
tends to become tiring and nervewracking. This will improve the 
quality of grades and leave the 
faculty free for more important 
work. These are only a few of the 
reforms which have been prom
ised. Johnstone has promised 
that there will be more in the future.
Extensive Changes Planned For 
Administration and Curriculum
Pittsburgh, Pa., March 32At ten twenty-five this morn
ing 1400 cheering Techites saw the learned Dr. Rumpty H. 
Coo installed as the fourth President of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology in a ceremony which climaxed the early morn
ing revolt in which the good doctor with the cooperation of 
the fraternities, sororities, and dormitories overthrew the 
tyrannical rule of the late Robert E. Doherty.
In a brief address, which was in direct contrast with the 
turbulence of the preceding hours of revolution, Dr. Coo out
lined the reasons for the radical 
changes in administration and 
read off a list of changes due to 
go into effect.*Dr. Coos first decree, which he 
democratically put to a popular 
vote, called for the discontinua
tion of scholastic activities at 
Tech until next fall in order that 
the reorganization of the admin
istration, curriculum, and campus 
might be complete successfully.
Dr. Coo modestly described the 
events of the preceding twentyfour hours. He explained how by 
chance he appeared amid smoke 
and atomic flame through the 
floor of the seventeenth sub-base
ment of Engineering Hall just as 
the campus wheels met in said 
subterranean vault to discuss the 
late Dr. Dohertys last ultimatum 
which abolished fraternities, re
stricted sororities, and banned 
meetings of the dorm councils.
He went on to explain how he 
quickly grasped the full signifi
cance of the situation and imme
diately conceived a plan of ac
tion which would incidentally in
volve the placing of the Honora
ble Dr. Rumpty H. Coo (E, 31) in 
control of the future destiny of 
C.I.T.
The Wizard of the Voodoo veldt 
talked only briefly of the nights 
events, for he soon switched to 
the topics of his new reforms.
In loving memory of the late 
Robert D. Teasdale, who by some 
mistake was strung from the near
est tree by eight fraternity men, 
Dr. Coo is going to install a new 
honor system called the Teasdale 
System.
After naming twenty beautiful 
secretaries to take dictation and 
[continued on page 3.]
andJan. 1, 1946 (Delayed 
how), Pittsburgh.
President Doherty has just an
nounced a change in faculty re
quirements. Beginning next fall, 
all members of the faculty, in or
der to retain their position, must 
write a 500 page book on the sub
ject which they teach or on some 
research in their respective fields. 
The faculty has received this ul
timatum with unrestrained exulta
tion. Said one It is time that our 
great colleges recognize the exalt
ed position and scholastic poten
tial of college professors. Long 
enough have we spent our days in 
dreary classrooms lecturing to 
dull-headed adolescents. College 
students should be capable of 
Working with a minimum of in
struction. Another faculty mem
ber expressed his opinions: It 
will at least allow us to share our 
superior knowledge with the 
world. And think of the benefits 
our students will gain from the 
greater supply of textbooks and 
research treatises on their 
courses!
Arts school and mathematics 
faculties were particularly de
lighted with the opportunity for 
research and writing. All profes
sors enjoyed the idea of more time 
for their individual work and less 
for classroom instruction.
The printing department was 
overjoyed. The greater output of 
written literature would naturally 
increase the demand for printers. 
Professor L. B. Siegfried has re
quested permission to design the 
format of these works.
Already the Carnegie Library is 
making plans for adding a wing to 
house the increased supply of 
books.
Students, faculty, and administration are all in favor of the plan.
Dean Guberman 
Changes Rules
Girl dorm students are anxious
ly awaiting word from the United 
States Senate as to the outcome of 
the vote on the new regulations 
proposed by Miss Ruth Guberman, 
new dean of women. The several 
revisions proposed would change 
the lax rules to ones of binding 
strictness. Instead of allowing the 
girls to retire at the decent hour 
of eight oclock, which they have 
been accustomed to doing, demer
its will be given for any girl who 
returns to the dorm before 4:30 
A. M. Moreover, under the new 
plan, girls will not be allowed to 
say goodnight to their dates out
side, but must bring them in for 
a minimum half hour period of 
compulsory necking. By far the 
worst calamity is the fact that 
girls will no longer be allowed to 
dash to the Inn for a breakfast 
of warm orange juice, cold toast, 
weak coffee, and rubbery oatmeal, 
but must remain in bed until 10:30 
leisurely reading a good novel 
while the house mother serves a 
delicious repast.

Teare Wins Honor 
In Half The Time
Benjamin Richard Teare, head 
of the Electrical Engineering De>- 
partment, has just received the 
very highest degree bestowed by 
the Departmentthe F.R. Degree 
for fuse replacing. This degree 
has only been awarded twice be
fore in the State of Pennsylvania. 
The first recipient was Dr. R.I.P. 
Coo, late grandfather of R. H. Coo 
and greatgrandfather of the com
ing R. H. Coo E.31. This tops the 
list of honors received by Dr. 
Teare, which include the Honorary 
Degrees of Doctor of Spontaneous
Osculation, Doctor of Agitating 
D.C.s, and Master ot B.S.
In order to be eligible for the 
F.R. Degree, Dr. Teare, thesesized 
(did investigative research) on the 
complicated mechanisms of the 
fuse. After many months of hard 
labor, during which he allowed 
himself only one ham sandwiph 
and two rubbers of bridge per day, 
he discovered that by finding a 
switch box, taking out the old fuse, 
and replacing it with a new one, 
he had accomplished a feat which 
not only brought a degree to him
self but brought light into the lives 
of many hard working engineers.
From now ad infinitum or adthe-use-blows-out, engineers will 
be indebted to Dr. Teare.

An
FIAKHAPPY RETORTS
Dear Editor:
Certain people seem to be mis
informed. We Veterans know that 
the instructors here at Tech are 
mostly of the highest calibre, but 
some are certainly snafuing the 
detail by not changing their teach
ing tactics to consider this seem
ingly unwanted personthe exG.I. (Boy does my ticket need 
punching! No clothes! No house! 
No money! And now they treat 
me mean at Tech! Where are you, 
Chaplain?)
In other words, we duller veter
ans arent absorbing what we 
should; and the old favorite, 
Youve had that in Z-100 isnt 
right in my estimation and doesnt 
lead to proper class discussion. So 
we keep quiet and suffer the con
sequences. Every instructor 
should realize that we arent too 
sharp after being away from the 
classroom for 4 or 5 years, and 
they should lecture accordingly.
I know (and this just isnt my per
sonal opinion as Ive discussed it 
with others) that the right ap
proach can work wonders, because 
three of my Profs realize our 
plight; and although the material 
is new, results are obtained. Their 
attitude promotes thorough, easy
going discussions, and a logical 
question doesnt bring leers from 
the younger quiz kids in the class. 
(I too was a Whizzer White once, 
but my mind has been dulled 
somewhat by long formation 
flights over Germany and long ex
hausting trips to Picadilly on short 
leaves.)
We realize that the staff has 
been tremendously over-worked 
and deserves a vacation; but still 
let us not forget the married vet
eran, some with children, who is 
undergoing undue hardships to get 
that questionable sheepskin. None 
of the instructors are deliberately 
venting their resentment on the 
veteran, Im sure, but some should 
review their past practices and re
alize that some thoughtfulness and 
consideration will do wonders to 
stimulate these foggy brains of 
ours.
We veterans dont want to start 
a civil war. Weve done our goldbricking in the service and now 
wish to work hard to take our 
rightful place in society as human 
beings. So please help us out and 
dont make us write any more let
ters because these take timeand 
that I cant afford.
Sincerely,
An eager but battle 
fatigued, flak happy, 
ex-co-throttle-jockey.
DDT SUGGESTS
For the past several weeks I 
have, been making' further inves
tigations of conditions on the cam
pus. In so doing I have uncover
ed several conditions both good 
and bad which should be brought 
before the public view. It seems 
advantageous to list my findings 
and suggestions so that necessary 
remedies can be effected.
(1) There has been too little 
emphasis on campus politics. For 
instance, one would think that the 
many organizations on campus 
should be able to stir up sufficient 
interest to post a few signs for 
something as interesting as the 
campus queen elections.
(2) There has been a great 
dearth of work in all colleges, 
particularly engineering, for the 
past two months. In utter bore
dom many students have had to 
resort to sitting on the lawn in 
front of Fine Arts just to pass the 
time. I would suggest a general 
faculty meeting to remedy the sit
uation.
(3 Classes have been much too 
small, and the school seems to be 
suffering from an overabundance 
of capable instructors. This situ
ation involves a great deal of ex
pense to the institution in these 
days of decreasing enrollment. I 
would suggest dismissing at least 
a quarter of these instructors.
(4) Good apartments and 
rooming homes have been going 
begging recently. If the school 
would advertise in an effort to in
crease the veteran enrollment, 
most of these places could proba
bly be filled within a year.
(5) Almost all the girls have 
been complaining bitterly; it 
seems that all too many men have
. Prof. McIntyre 
Publicly Analyzes 
Skunk Cabbage
Last Sunday the students of the 
departments of Chemistry, Chemi
cal, and Metallurgical Engineering 
were treated to a demonstration of 
the proper method of analyzing a 
skunk cabbage for its plutonium 
concentration. One of Techs best 
known and most popular instruc
tors, Professor McIntyre, gave the 
demonstration on the fifth floor 
of Engineering Hall.
The evening was opened with a 
short talk by Professor McIntyre 
who spoke of plutoniums import
ance in the atomic age. He re
vealed that he had found the Am
erican skunk cabbage to be an 
important source of this rare ele
ment and said that it was only his 
love of humanity and a pay raise 
which was causing him to give 
this demonstration.
After bringing in fifteen pounds 
of assorted precision chemical 
glassware, our noted scientist 
mixed them thoroughly with a 
sledgehammer to promote proper 
thermal diffusion. He then pro
ceeded to pour out a liter of hot 
concentrated sulphuric acid into a 
100 c.c. beaker and added a few 
kilograms of the sample of skunk 
cabbage. The cabbage dissolved 
in a few minutes, shortly before 
the professors shoes. He then dis
tilled, titrated, electrolyzed, and 
weighed the resulting mixture, 
bouncing the liquid off the ceiling 
girders between operations to 
promote proper thermal diffusion. 
As expected, the final analysis re
vealed the presence of .1111 atoms 
of the much sought-after Pu239. 
This demonstration of absolute ac
curacy and superlative skill thrill
ed the assembled students who 
broke out into spontaneous ap
plause. Professor McIntyre bowed 
gratefully and told the Marine 
guards that they were dismissed.
been enrolling at Tech. Further-^ 
more all too few of these men are 
married.
(6) The professors at Carnegie 
Tech represent on the whole an 
excellent cross section of almost 
all important educational institu
tions in the country. Only one 
school seems to have been neg
lected. Yale is a reasonably good 
institution and should be repre
sented by at least one man at 
Tech.
(7) In recent years the trend 
at Tech has been to place ever in
creasing emphasis on athletics. 
This sort of thing should cease. 
Carnegie Tech must not risk los
ing its academic reputation. After 
all the books are much more im
portant.
(8) The weather has been 
much too fine and spring has ar
rived too early. This situation is 
deplorable since it causes a few 
of the students to stray unwilling
ly from their work. The school 
might well place all lawns and 
the Senior Fence off limits.
(9) The Administration has 
failed miserably in passing reg
ulations for women students. The 
dorm rules are much too lax. Al
most every Saturday many girls 
have been seen out as late as 
12:30.
(10) Food in the Skibo re
cently has been much too good 
and far too inexpensive. This sit
uation works a great hardship on 
commuters and students who oc
casionally visit their homes. The 
contrast between the food at Ski
bo and the food at home often 
causes the student to feel bitter 
about the meals taken away from 
school.
(11) Complaints have been 
pouring in from all over. It seeijis 
that the instructors in all courses 
have been going much too slowly. 
The veterans are particularly 
anxious to have a speed up.
(12) All honoraries have been 
elected quite fairly with malice 
towards none and with considera
tion for all. Lets hope that this 
exemplary example will be con
tinued far into the future.

Tragedy Strikes 
As Work of Union 
Goes For Naught
Last night at 9 p. m. the follow
ing notice was postal conspicu
ously on the several bulletin 
boards:
Is $1.00 a haircut too much?
Do you want a free singe?
Just stick around Industries!
Evening school students saw the 
small groups of slinking figures 
who posted these notices, unau
thorized. They sensed the electric 
tenseness in the air. But the 
newly organized Window Washers 
Union, holding its diurnal, noc
turnal outing was not fazed a bit. 
They were washing the windows 
of Industries Hall and by golly 
they would not be stopped.
But a somber note of tragedy 
was struck. As is well known, 
the windows of Industries Hall 
are never washed for fear the stu
dents will look outside. The union 
was washing the windows only at 
the suggestion of State Troopers 
brought in from the Greensburg, 
Pennsylvania barracks to do the 
suggesting. So now that they 
were washing the windows, the 
Knights of the Night wanted to do 
a good job. In the words of Mr. 
Melton Mophead, the Union Presi
dent:
Our Union does not do things 
by half measures. When we 
knocks a state trooper on the head 
with a lead pipe, we knocks him 
hard. When we eats our steaks, 
we eats them raw. Our union is 
the elitest Union there is. So 
when we washes dem winders we 
lavishes bucketsful .of loving care 
on em. We washes dem winders 
with gentle caresses and we licks 
em clean wid our tongues. Those 
winders were so clean you could 
see through them. And now what 
is it that these no-account mater
nity fellows do? They incendiar
ies the building on fire. So the 
glass rolls down from the windows 
like Niagara Falls, and here is our 
masterpiece busted.
Mr. Mophead stopped to daub a 
tear -from his eye.
Truly, we feels like a bereaved 
family, and Im speaking for every 
member of de Union from base
ment window up. Not one of us 
has a dry eye. Ah, Varus! give 
me back my windows!
At which Mr. Mophead tight
ened his toga strap, cocked back 
his big brown mophead, and went 
to work as a guide. See the ruins 
of Industries Hall for twenty-five 
cents!

Miss Herrons philanthropic op
erations in Tanganyika included: 
converting the natives from mar
ihuana to opium, instituting 
necking as an intramural sport, 
and, with the help of Dr. R. H. 
Coo (E 31), the only white man 
in the country, making the yak 
egg the national fruit. She receiv
ed the Purple Heart for her work 
with Dr. Coo (E 31). Previous 
to her 47 years in that country, 
Miss Herron had worked in 
Droopistan, the capital city of 
Whipped - Cream - on - the - 
Shortcake, as a numbers bookie. 
The fortune which she amassed 
in this way, she dedicated to the 
aforementioned philanthropies.
She is looking forward espec
ially to teaching History of Phil

September, for she feels that this 
subject is essential to the produc

who, in order to pass the course, 
will be required to roll down the

Changes of note include the re
call of Sidney Berkowitz from 
Salem, Mass., where he is employ
ed in his fathers brewery as chief 
drunk and bottle sampler, to take 
the position of Dean of Men. Miss 
Ruth Guberman has already ac

the New Director of Physical Edu
cation.
Doc Willis has been appointed 
head of Modern Dance in Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College as well 
as assistant in the Department of 
Voice and Speech. The ever popu
lar Claude Renee Schwob has 
been transferred from the Drama 
Department to Chief Engineer in 
charge of picking up cigarette 
butts around recitation rooms.
In the future the Chemistry De
partment will concentrate solely on 
improvements in the process of 
distillation of grain alcohol. There 
will be a new Department of 
Practical Mechanics which will 
include a special post-graduate 
course in safe-cracking.
First on the list of campus proj

makes and models of technological 
pigeons.
Morewood Gardens will be 
sued for the sum of $159,834,-

Oh no! Danny, replied the 
beauteous Helen, They really 
wanted to come. They know that

Mr. Kayes comment on meet

view with the statement that since 
Kaye and Arden had volunteered 
their services, the success of Spring 
Carnival has been assured.
The price of tickets for Spring 
Carnival will toe $75.00 plus 70 
cents taxper person.
Thunhurst
Betas Oust 
Thunhurst
It was disclosed last night by 
John Seipel, President of the 
Betas, that Bill Thunhurst has 
been outsed from the Carnegie 
Chapter of Beta Theta Pi. In mak
ing this announcement, Mr. Seipel 
stated that Bills unpopularity and 
homeliness were so jeopardizing 
the position of the fraternity on 
campus that the organization was 
forced to take drastic action.
The Betas, previous to the final 
and irretrievable step, had made 
all efforts to improve the situation 
without ostracizing Mr. Thunhurst. 
They, at first, hoped that plastic 
surgery might be employed to 
avert the crisis, but after discuss
ing the case with several famous 
specialists, they discovered that 
to pay for the operation, they 
would be forced to sell their 
house. Since even the great Dr. 
Improvsakisser coujd not guaran
tee the success of the operation it 
was decided that the chapter did 
not want to take the financial loss. 
After handing down his discour
aging prognosis, Dr. Improvsakis
ser was heard to say, There are 
times when I believe most sin
cerely in mercy killings! After 
failing to lift Mr. Thunhursts face, 
the Betas chipped in and sent him 
to Hollywood hoping that he could 
find a place in life as competition 
for Boris Karloff, but he was re
jected by Hollywood directors on 
the grounds that he was just too 
horrible!
Rumor has it that his expulsion 
has affected the brain of the ape
faced Mr. Thunhurst. Evidence 
which seems to point in this direc
tion is the fact that he entered the 
Campus Queen campaign last 
week. Dr. Paul M. Rike, campus 
physician, announced that he is 
recommending that Bill be confin
ed to Mayview along with Dr. 
Schoen. Dean Berkowitzs only 
comment on the subject was, 
Anyone who imagines that the 
girls are continuously chasing him 
is certainly in a dangerous condi
tion and should be confined to an 
institution.
75,000 and a new Student Union 
are on the drawing boards with 
bids coming in from construction 
companies all over the Pittsburgh 
district.
Streetcars will be rerouted, and 
escalators will service the halls 
of all buildings with subways be
tween the different colleges. The 
new Industries Hall will be equip
ped with self-washing windows 
and a special ray that is harmful 
to pigeons.
In a surprise landslide election 
last Friday, Dr. R. D. Gregg, long
haired professor of the Social Re
lations Department and dark horse 
of the proceedings, gained a tie 
vote with Ginger, the 7-1 favorite. 
Long regarded as one of the insti
tutions leading highbrows, Dr. 
Gregg received the news that he 
would occupy the throne at Spring 
Carnival with evident pleasure 
and extreme anticipation. After 
graciously extending sincerest con
gratulations to the lovely co-wiriner, the good doctor spoke a few 
brief, well-chosen blue-books of 
acceptance and invoked the aid of 
Plato, Marcus Aurelius, and Web 
Jones in fulfilling the duties of the 
sacred office to the best of his 
ability.
He promised to deliver the 
Presidential Inaugural Address 
during the big dance as being par
ticularly apropos of the occasion. 
With becoming modesty RDG then 
congratulated the voters on their 
excellent discrimination and fine 
citizenship in recognizing the best 
candidate. His acceptance was 
climaxed by these historic words: 
I wish to particularly thank those 
of my constituents who gave me 
seven votes each. Will all those 
to whom I lent extra registration
Dr. Mobert Rehl 
Offers New Class 
In Smoke Blowing
Dr. Mobert F. Rehl, DDS, LLD, 
DDT, BO, LSMFT, announced yes
terday that the experimental class 
in smoke blowing techniques, C 
eleventy-seven and a half E dxdy, 
was starting work on a new proj
ect, the development of a perfected 
Petty girl figure from the purest 
smoke available. This class, which 
meets the thirteenth hour on the 
Junior Fence in back of the ball
room, uses only Strucky Likes in 
their lessons. Starting with such 
simple exercises as the blowing of 
square smoke rings, the pupils, 
who will receive an SB degree 
(smoke blowing, that is) upon 
graduation, progress to the blow
ing of double integrals concerning 
volumes of revolution and mo
ments of inertia. Besides the 
compulsory weekly field trips to 
downtown Pittsburgh and the steel 
mills in order to study better 
methods of making smoke, each 
student is required to hand in a 
scrapbook containing his best ex
amples of smoke-blowing.
Nothing unusual happening this 
week in spite of the fact that 
spring has returned to campus in 
all its glory. But well try to strug
gle along as best we can. Seen at 
the beer party at the Kappa 
house: Jo Sunseri with Kenny

As the good doctor withdrew his 
right foot from the wastebasket, 
a group of sober men in the back
ground struck up a rousing chorus 
of Hail To Alpha Phi Omega.
Research Men 
Visit Campus
This week the Carnegie Campus 
will be honored by the presence of 
a distinguished group of visitors 
from the University of Moscow, 
here to do special research in an
tiquarian mathematics. The mis
sion is headed by Dr. Gregory I. 
Goofoff, chief professor of an
thropology and mathematics at the 
University , and world reknowned 
for his researches. After being 
feted in the Carnegie Union to
night at a subscription banquet 
costing 25 rubles per plate, the 
learned visitors will be conducted 
on a tour through Industries.
Although the subject of the re
search to be done is officially a se
cret, your correspondent somehow 
gained access to Prof. Goofoff and 
found him, between bumpers, in a 
very affable mood. Ill tell y6u 
why were here, said the Siberian 
born scientist. The atomic bomb 
is old stuff to us antiquarian math
ematicians; we are after .bigger 
game here at Harnegie Peck, you 
call it? We in Russia have learned 
that the classroom windows in In
dustries Hall have not been 
washed for ages. Since it is re
liably known that Neanderthal 
man once roved these precincts, 
we wish to decipher the writing 
on the windows, for we are sure 
that some of it is of Neanderthal 
origin.
In particular, he continued, 
their mathematical scribbling in
terests us. Who knows, we may 
learn how to beat the numbers 
game. Then too, we suspect that 
Neanderthal man could integrate 
the form XYZ which still puzzles 
us.
But Dr. Goofoff, your corre
spondent interrupted, what makes 
you think these writings are so 
ancient?
Ha, he answered, thats a 
substantiated fact. Why just to
day my assistant told me he saw 
WE BEAT PITT scribbled on a 
window. Now do you doubt that 
it is ancient?
The Harnegie Hampus wishes 
happy hunting to Prof. Gregory 
Goofoff and his borsh-loving as

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 2, 1946
Our one of the girls this week 
is so modest that she wont let us 
use her name. But were sure 
youll recognize this demure 
maiden anyway.
Her father is very rich. So rich, 
in fact, that she has worn a stun
ning brown fur coat all winter. 
But our D. M. (Demure Maiden) 
does not boast about her wealth.
Coos Revolution
[Continued from page 1] 
over about five in the morning by 
some Thetas and DGs, who call
ed in the fraternities to hold the 
fort. The Loyalist forces tried 
desperately to retake Maggie 
Murph, but they were driven 
back by a barrage of biscuits bak
ed by the Chi Os, and thrown by 
the TXs. Under a deadly cross
fire from Engineering Hall and 
Fine Arts, the SAEs and the Delts 
set up a machine gun nest at the 
Senior Fence (see picture).
In desperation, Honest Bob 
hatched a fiendish plot. He set up 
a loudspeaker in Engineering 
Hall, and Dr. Goodfellow read se
lections from College Prose to the 
rebel forces at the Senior Fence. 
Within five minutes, sixteen of 
Coos men had been bored to 
death, while the rest were bored 
to tears and couldnt shoot 
straight. But just as they were 
ready to surrender to Doherty, 
Pete Prieto saved the day with a 
brainstorm. Why not, he reasoned, 
go into the steam tunnels from 
Maggie Murph to Engineering 
Hall and take Goodfellow by sur
prise? The scheme almost ended 
disastrously when the Betas went 
into the wrong tunnel and came 
out in the Womens Gym. Before 
they realized where they were, six 
Betas were clubbed to death by 
enraged Tri-Delts, who were pre
paring to play basketball. In spite 
of these difficulties, Coos men 
captured Engineering Hall and 
silenced the loudspeaker in time 
to save the gallant men at the 
Senior Fence. As soon as this key 
position had been occupied, the 
insurgents organized for a suicide 
charge over to Industries Hall. 
Armed with target rifles, B-B 
guns, sling-shots, bean-shooters, 
ping-pong paddles, pool cues, 
baseball bats, slide rules, tennis 
rackets, paint brushes, clubs, and 
bricks, a courageous handful of 
engineers stormed toward the So
cial Relations wing of Industries 
Hall. Professor Gregg of the So
cial Relations department stuck 
his head out the window of the 
Soc Rel library to plead with 
Coos rebels. Gentlemen, he 
said, if youll just bear with 
meHe never finished his sen
tence. The suns rays, glinting off 
the top of Greggs head, had fo
cused on a batch of Soc Rel 
books. The books were so dry that 
they caught fire instantly, and in 
two minutes Industries Hall was 
an inferno. The fire finally stop
ped just short of the Administra
tion building, after reducing In
dustries Hall to smoking ruins 
(see picture).
Honest Bob made his last stand 
in Skibo when it became too hot 
for him in Administration Hall. 
But a squad of daring men known 
as Coos Raiders finally trap
ped him behind the steam table 
in the Beanery, where he held 
them at a distance by crouching 
behind the coffee urn and threat
ening to pour hot, concentrated 
Skibo coffee on the first man to 
come after him. Then Merle Wolfe 
conceived a brilliant plan! Safely 
shielded by a barricade of chairs 
at the Kappa table, the Rebels 
sang Techs Alma Mater. When 
Honest Bob stood up and removed 
his hat, he was struck right be
tween the eyes by a projectile 
from a bean-shooter. His last 
words were, The Carnegie In
stitute of Technology shall never 
subsidize intercollegiate athletics.
That evening, Dr. Robert Doher
ty was laid to rest under the cash
iers office, near the money he 
loved so well. After the funeral, 
refreshments were served by 
APO.
In fact if you try to borrow a 
nickel from her you wont get it.
Her favorite people, she says, 
are men. You can have your 
handsome men and your witty 
ones, and the ones who whisper 
sweet nothings into your ears. 
Our D. M. likes men with strong 
arms. Of course she blushes as 
she said this, but, she explained, 
If men dont have strong arms, I 
get no exercise. We know just 
how she feels.
Where does she hang out? Oh, 
any place around the campus. The
D. M. is always surrounded by a 
circle of admirers, so she is easy 
to locate. Sometimes, however,
she gets too ardent. Fireworks!
The D. M. is majoring in Social 
Relations. She hopes after grad
uation to visit her many relations 
and to be sociable with them, for, 
as she says, I cant tell when one 
of them will kick off and leave me 
a pile of bones. However, her 
interests transcend the humani
ties. She is interested in animals, 
especially dogs, Not all dogs, you 
understand. I have my prefer
ences.
Our heroine is not one of those 
girls who must always express 
her individuality. However, she 
does have one mania  buried 
treasure. She is always hunting for 
it; she loves to dig. Some people 
smoke, some drink, some look for 
buried treasurelive and let live, 
we always say.
If the D. M. has any vices they 
are minor ones. Nevertheless, some 
of the girls are pretty catty about 
her. They particularly resent her 
sun bathing in the nude although 
the D. M. is very modest about it.
Among the other honors that 
have been passed her way was 
her recent nomination as a candi
date for campus queen.
If you havent guessed her name, 
heres a hint: its G-ng-r.

sorority member. Each room will 
contain a telephone, for it has been 
noted in the past that the biggest 
bottleneck in dormitory life (even 
worse than that for the bath) is 
the single telephone. With the 
new accentuation of the social life 
and the resultant decrease in work 
outside of class, this jam could be 
expected to become even worse. 
Each house will be furnished with 
six convertible coupes, so that the 
girls can commute to and from the 
campus. The houses will be fur
nished with elaborate but cozy 
lounges which will be illuminated 
by a single chandelier covered 
thickly with black diamonds. The 
furniture in these lounges will be 
the new sectional furniture that 
can be so easily arranged into 
conversational (?) groups. The 
upholstery will be royal purple 
velvet which will be set off by 
a black rug with a three inch pile. 
The walls will be decorated with 
gold sorority crests. These lounges 
will be especially designed for the 
nightly parties for the various fra
ternities. As President R. H. Coo 
says, We want our girls to be 
popular.
House mothers will be unneces
sary in the new houses for they 
will be furnished with electric 
maids, and there will therefore be 
no need for supervision. Gas sta
tions will be installed in the base
ment of each house so that the 
school may keep the convertibles 
running at all times. The school 
will also supply other liquid neces
sities to the sororities, as well as 
food for the all-electric kitchen. 
Our boy, Old Rump, speaking for 
all the faculty members said, The 
girls must be kept healthy and 
happy so that they can make the 
best use of the little time that they 
must devote to their studies under 
the new system. We must see that 
they get their calories and that 
they do not have to expend too 
much energy.
Incidentally, there has been 
some talk about a new Social Re
lations course in which the en
gineer must spend three hours a 
week at one of the new houses 
learning to balance a teacup on his 
knee.
Dorm Council Ball 
Coming Apr. 6 
Will Be Informal
On Saturday, April 6 at the 
Greasy Spoon which is known 
among the hoi-polloi as the Hotel 
Schenley, the Mens Dorm Council 
is sponsoring a little get-together 
at the Bar. (No relation to Cross
ing the Bar, studying for the bar 
which is not done at the Greeks 
etc.) An additional feature of the 
evening will be dancing to the mu
sic of Sad Sack and his Slush 
Pump Operators Local No. 375 
whose style was originated by Kilroy.
Incidentally, we are expecting 
Kilroy to be there. He was in 
every mess hall in the army so 
hell be sure to show up at the 
Schenley. Kilroys companion for 
the evening will be the campus 
queen, Ginger.
The chaperons will be Mr. and 
Mrs. Max Hannum, Mr. and Mrs. 
Frank A. Eyman, Mr. and Mrs. 
Walter Burns, and Mammy and 
Pappy Yocum. Dr. R. H. Coo will 
not be there!
Admission to the dance is free, 
tax $1.80. Ticket sellers can be 
identified by the size of the clubs 
which they carry.
Kilroy will speak on the Chinese 
Sewer System, which he thinks 
smells. He has been in every the
ater of operation including the 
Casino so he is well qualified to 
speak.
Unlike the Booze Arts Ball this 
dance is open to all stewdents. 
Then again you can come as you 
are (within reason of course). 
Your costume doesnt have to come 
out of Cuspidor Dollie either.
As all the dances of the season 
have featured the crowning of a 
king or queen we wish to assure 
you that several people will be 
crowned before the evening is 
over.
Due to the realization of the 
high purpose and aim of the Mens 
Dorm Council, Dean Gubie has 
granted 4:30 A. M. permission to 
all women who attend this brawl 
I mean Ball.
We will not exaggerate the 
merits of this dance. We will 
merely tell you why you should 
not go:
(1) Everyone you know will be 
there.
(2) $1.80 will buy 18 beers.
(3) Kilroy better known as I 
wont wolf your girl Im your 
buddy Killjoy will be there.
(4) Youd probably have an aw
ful time trying to decide who to 
takeSwaney, Henson, Grable, or 
Peggy Ann Garner.
(5) Since you go to Tech you 
cant dance too well anyhow so 
why waste your time and spoil 
your dates feet. (I wonder how 
many letters to the Editor that 
will bring on?)
Notice
Dr. Coo hopes that students 
with further ideas for the im
provement of the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology will not 
hestitate to dial Co. 0000 and 
ask for Old Rump.
The meeting will be an
nounced later.
Champagne Saves 
Tech Firefighters
Those crazy sentimental fools 
who earnestly fought to save In
dustries Hall were at least well 
fed. It started when the seven 
Thistle Queens dressed in bathing 
suits brought out soup bowls of 
caviar. Ten minutes later the 
Spring Carnival candidates drop
ped out of an airplane and as they 
slowly drifted down in their white 
parashoots the odor of roast tur
key became stronger. It seems the 
girls were taking complete din
ners to some of the boys in the 
back of the building who could 
not be reached by the regular 
means. After everyone had their 
meal a car drove up and the mayor 
of the city presented a bottle of 
champagne to every fire fighter. 
The champagne had been jointly 
donated by the Greeks, Kahns, 
and Shulbergs.
onei^OYS
Arts Students 
Combine Talents 
For Ball, Apr. 12
The Beaux Arts Honorary So
ciety is sponsoring an assembly 
on Tuesday afternoon, April 2nd, 
to display costumes and ideas for 
costumes and the models in the 
outdoor theater. Students other 
than Fine Arts students, especially 
engineers, are definitely welcome, 
for the main feature of the after
noon will be a costume displayed 
by Caroline Cook of the Drama 
Department which will consist 
only of Beaux Arts Ball tickets 
and thread. Students may buy 
their tickets directly from the cos
tume. Such a scheme will no 
doubt increase ticket sales tre
mendously, especially in the De
partment of Architecure.
Ideas for the Beaux Arts Ball 
become more spectacular every 
minute. The decorations will be 
amazing. Sets are being designed 
by Salvator Dali and built by 
Warner Bros. Any students who 
wish to put the finishing touches 
on the sets may come up to the 
paint frame at any time. The paint 
frame is located between the 4th 
and 5th floors of Fine Arts. They 
can probably be seen on March 
29th in the Exhibition Room.
Chances will soon be put on 
sale for the prizes of a complete 
make-up Max Factor to go with 
costumes designed by Renee (who 
is starting a new style trend) to 
be worn to the Ball. Of course, the 
student who wins must fly to Hol
lywood to be fitted personally.
Music for the Beaux Arts Ball 
will be furnished by Spike Jones 
and his City Slickers. To provide 
more room for dancing, a balcony 
is being constructed above the 
foyer of Fine Arts for the orches
tra. The floor of the balcony is to 
be constructed of net and lattice 
work to provide the proper sur
realist effect. It will be decorated 
with huge pink eyes.
Because of the elaborate prep
arations that have been made and 
because both Life and Look maga
zines are coming to photograph 
the event, the Administration does 
not want to appear prudish before 
these national publications, so 
the Ball is to continue all night of 
April 12th.
The latest addition to Techs 
campus is a BTO of no mean pro
portions, Kilroy by name. He just 
blew in from some one of those 
well-run Army posts out in the 
far wilds' of Anaheim, Azuza, or 
Kukamonga, , it doesnt matter 
which. Your Tartan reporter in
terviewed him almost as soon as 
he hit campus, and are we lucky 
to be able to present this first
hand storyNO!
About Kilroy, he is a young 
fellow in his early twenties, or 
thirties, who has knocked around 
quite a bit. He has been in al
most every corner of this round 
earthblondes, brunettes, or red
heads, he doesnt careand has 
seen a lot of things we would like 
to see (75% of the women are good 
looking and the Tech women came 
up from the devils hideout with 
Dr. CooT. Kilroy is a rather quiet, 
retiring, shy, diffident fellow, 
much like the Skibo wolf, Merle 
Wolff, and his preferences and de
sires in life are close akin to those 
of every other pea-brained, hy
drocephalic schizophrenoid (Dr. 
Porter take note). He has a lot 
of PERSONALITY, and he likes 
his to be well-developed like that 
of Robin PivirottoRuth to youse 
as dont know her. He is interested 
in some sports, such as football, 
basketball, soccer, handball, vollyball, squash, badminton, jai-alai 
(how did that get in here?), fenc
ing, swimming, tennis, track, golf, 
polo, and hockey, but it seems that 
he leans more to a good game of 
jack-straws than anything else.
Kilroy plans to enroll in the Arts 
college of Engineering to work 
on the processes of making syn
thetic gum for the double-bubble 
company. His prefreshman course 
will consist of such things as atom
ic physics in atomic amounts, 
quantitative chemistry in zero 
quantitives, bridgefor at least 
eight hours a day, marriage rela
tions (need we say more?), and 
Schenley Park. So what! Its 
Spring, aint it?
As you can tell, he is one of 
those simple young men who en
joys life to the fullest as long as 
he has the essentials of life about 
him, essentials, that is.
In case you are still in doubt as 
to whom this character might be, 
it has been generally admitted that 
he came into being in the E.T.O. 
ever tried Overholt?  whence 
he became famous. Vets all over 
the world have seen the now fam
ous signs, Kilroy was here, and 
in some instances, these signs ap
peared in most surprising places. 
For example, the underground and 
guerilla fighters would post these 
signs in obscure places just before 
an invasion was scheduled in their 
area. The effect on the morale of 
the invading forces was almost 
electric, and the boys began to 
look forward to finding these 
signs.
Recently another copy of Es
quire came out(!) and Kilroy was 
one of the feature stories of the 
issue. We havent read the story 
yet, but we hope this isnt refut
ing any of Esquires claims. Our 
only other comment about Kilroy 
is that we hope the Mens Dorm 
Council can produce him at their 
dance. Dr. R. H. Coo couldnt 
make it, can Kilroy?

TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5Tartan Dice Team Rolls Over Pitt 11-7
Tech Bowl To Be 
Revamped; Will 
Seat 75000 Fans
The Carnegie Tech administra
tion has announced that prepara
tions are being made to accommo
date 75,000 people in the Tech 
bowl. In the true Tech tradition, 
Rumpty H. Coos mouthpieces 
have made lavish arrangements. 
The accommodations will consist 
of 70,000 plush-lined seat which 
are reclining, 300 reserved twin 
beds, 4,700 of something left over 
which will be dug out later.
And that aint all! There will 
be hot and cold running beer, and 
pretzels autographed by the team. 
The peddlers will include an as
sortment of hot water bottles, joyjuice jugs, potato chips in the 
shape of the new Tech bowl, and 
assorted other trinkets to give 
the crowd a thrill.
According to the plan, which 
was evolved at a midnight ses
sion of the higher-ups, Ship Fit
ters Union, Local 302, CIT, will 
begin excavation the second Tues
day next week. The first part of 
the project involves the digging of 
a hole 120 yards long, 50 yards 
wide, and 300 yards deep. The 
plan then calls for ropes to be at
tached to the Margaret Morrison 
College and said college to be giv
en a gentle tug until it topples in
to the hole. This will represent the 
foundation for the new football 
field. As soon as the college is 
covered over with dirt and the 
gophers replaced, the dynamic 
plywood structure will be at
tempted.
Upon completion of the new 
stadium and the erection of
1,500,000 No Smoking signs, 
moss will 'be planted on the play
ing field and Techs goal line for
tified with a 15-foot brick wall.
With the help of 16,000 trained 
fleas and termites the Ship Fit
ters promise to have the stadium 
completed in time for the begin
ning of the 1972 season. See you 
there!
Tartan Grid Card Altered;

Tartan a week ago would not pre
sent enough competition for the 
Tech football team this fall. After 
many long-distance phone calls 
the Tech officials have arranged 
the following warm-up games for 
the Ski'bos:
Aug. 12Navy at Annapolis.
Aug. 13Notre Dame at South 
Bend.
Aug. 14S tenchy Prep at 
Stenchy.
Aug. 15Southern Cal. at Sun
ny California.
1The Lonesome Polecats 
at Dogpatch.
2Univ. of Kentucky at 
Paintsville, Ky.
Oct. 3Vassar at Schenley Park. 
Oct. 4Mt. Holyoke at Mass. 
Back Woods.
While the rough August sched

ule of 4 games in 4 days presents 
transportation difficulties, the 
Athletic Department has an
nounced that the team will travel 
by jet-propelled, atomic-supercharged kiddie-cars. This will un
doubtedly solve the problem.
Under cover of dark the Skibos 
have held numerous practices to 
date and opened their spring sea
son last Friday night by slaught
ering Army at West Point 59-0 as 
burly Casey Stine ripped off 2004 
yards all by his lonesome. The 
weighty Techite made Doc Blan
chard look like a fish. C. T. 
Rebel Butler outsprinted the 
speedy Glen Davis for a sensation
al 105-yard dash to the one and 
only shower after the game.
Half-time activities featured the 
hairy legs of Norman Dawes as 
he led the Kiltie Band in a mod
ern version of the Highland Fling 
as Uncle Andrew turned over in 
his moldy grave.

Zeke Brill, Jelly Roll Evans 
In Rare Form
A. SWEENEY STARS
Fifteen thousand Mexican athletes crowded the Ladies 
Room of the ever-popular University Grill in the wee hours
of April 1 to watch the snake-eyed Tartan sextet trim
an inexperienced group of non-union crap throwers from the 
University of Pittsburgh by a count of 11-7.
Coached by Bonehead Michener, who starred on the An
thropology A. and M. dice team in the sensational seasons fol
lowing the passing of the Eighteenth amendment, the Skibo 
Scalpers pulled ahead in the final round of the tight tourna
ment due to their long hours of pre-season practice.
Paced by Captain Zeke Brill with his air-cushioned knee 
pads, the Techite rolled one seven after another. Jelly-Roll 
Evans was the man of the hour as he kept bringing back
------------------------------------------------------ Phoebe for eight straight passes.
Tech faltered in the second round, 
but Lippy Lou Umbach, using 
Bernoullis Theorem, let loose with 
more crap than anyone has seen 
around here for a long time.
After guzzling four rounds from 
the Tech Bowl, the contest got 
under way with B-B-eyes Bob 
Noyes leading off with a hot seven 
followed by box cars. Fresh from 
the mine shaft. Stanislaw Stiles, 
the Pitt captain, got red hot at this 
point. Four Big Dicks and a 
pair of Little Joes put the 
Panthers ahead in the early 
rounds.
The Hat Silverman, after 
crapping out on three successive 
rolls, kissed the African golf-balls 
to set off the spree which brought 
the Tartan bone-rollers back into 
the game. Two pints of Three 
Feathers and a fifth of Lord Cal
vert inspired the boys from the 
Oakland Boys Club to set the 
stage for Lou Umbachs come
back.
After sweeping the floor clear 
with her bottled-blonde locks, 
Anne Zombie Sweeney, rolling in 
the clean-up position, clinched the 
match, among other things, by 
ripping off seven passes interrupt
ed by a solitary crap.
Mid the dusky gloom of the 
smoke-filled alcoholic atmosphere, 
referee Gtewhladrpta (the Greek 
to you) called the affair to an end 
due to the round corners of the 
galloping dominoes.
FLASH!
* vBy virtue of his 4.30 factor 
while serving as a graduate 
student on the University of 
Pittsburghs coaching staff,
Dr. John B. Sutherland has 
finally made the grade! The 
good Doctor has been appoint
ed 15th assistant backfield

Female Greeks 
Are All Knits!
In a recent competition here at 
Carnegie Heck, to determine the 
best little knitter on campus, the 
Kappas won by turning out good 
necks. The judges realized this 
was the result of long practice.
The Thetas won second prize 
of $.50 and two tickets to the J. 
P. Harris Theater. The KATS 
were hampered somewhat by the 
loss of their ace poil twoer, Mary 
Jane Horridge. The beloved prexy 
was unable to attend as she was 
too busy with other affairs. We 
wouldnt say shes Scotch but  
well, heres the story  It seems 
that the lady in question spilled a 
bottle of beer on her Theta cap, 
and when last seen was wringing 
the excess into a glass and drink
ing it. Such desecration!
The Tri-Delts had the audience 
in stitches, (That should have 
bowled you over, son. Whats hold
ing you up?) when they attempt
ed a cable-stitch with standard 
A. T. & T. cable. They were un
able to place due to fact that the 
judgesthe D. U.swere too busy 
with their vocation,  booking 
numbers.
The Tau Delts turned in several
very cute pairs of pink and blue 
booties. They are going to con
tribute these to a home for un
married mothers. They feel that 
this is the least they can do.
The D. G.s, a bunch of cast-offs 
from Away Backwhich is in the 
Northern part of the statemade 
their entry from wool which they 
obtained from the Nutty Knit Fac

in a free sample of this wool 
should tear off the head of their 
local dealer and send it in to the 
Department of Sanitation.
Mermen Drown in Bath Tub! 
Bob Straka is Now a Zombie
The flag in front of Fine Arts 
Building was at half-mast today 
and the campus mourned the pass
ing of some of its best citizens. 
There were tears in the eyes of 
all those concerned, and in the 
gutters were torrents made by the 
accumulation of more weeping 
than Tech has seen since Smoe 
passed away. For those of you 
who have no inside track to the

campus information, it is my sad 
duty to report that Monday night 
at 2:30 the entire swimming team 
drowned in the bathtub of Scobell Hall.
Bob Straka wras the first to ar
rive for practice, showing up at 
6:30 in the eveninghis usual
0.003 factor self. When Bob had 
donned his plaid trunks (a symbol 
of his true Tech devotion) and 
jumped into the Tub, the others 
began to arrive. Soon the whole 
squad was there, including the 
managers who had brought wood
en boats for the boys to play with.
The bath tub was serene until 
Coach Risedorph shot the gun and 
everyone dove in at once. Thai 
was the end. The water was push
ed up over their heads as fate 
intervened to grasp the group and 
squeeze from them the last breath 
of life. We will now have a mo
ment of silence for those who died 
for the old Alma Mater. Amen.

Friday afternoon, Carfiegie stu
dents went to the polls to select 
the Court of the Campus Queen 
at Spring Carnival. The candi
dates, representing Carnegies most 
lovely women were elected by 
popular vote, following a spirited 
and intense campaign for the va
rious candidates.
The girls chosen to this Carni
val Court were: Jean Garland, 
Margaret Harris, Helen Jaffurs, 
Camilla McCullough, Ann Stans
bury, Shirley Swaney, and Pat 
Werner. From this court of seven, 
one girl will be selected later to 
be crowned Campus Queen at 
Spring Carnival, and she will be 
attended by her court.
Intense campaigning was carried on by each of the eighteen 
girls. On Wednesday and Thurs
day noons, airplanes flew low 
over the campus, dropping adver
tising and publicity for Anne 
Sweeney and Lil Moravecky, re
spectively. A couple of ex-navy 
pilots did the flying.
The wall behind Whitfield Hall 
received a very thorough going 
over by various crews of men 
backing different candidates. The 
names Boltey, Harris, and Werner 
were first painted there, followed 
in a couple of days by a repaint 
job with a Vote for Garland, 
Swaney, and Creelman. On the 
night before the election, it is 
rumored that the wall was re
painted on four separate occasions, 
beginning around midnight and
finally being painted with a Vote 
for Boltey, Harris sign about 6 
A. M.
On the morning of the election, 
a flag with the standard Stans
bury was seen flying from the 
flagpole. There had been two flags 
erected the night before. Thurs
day morning a large number of 
balloons were flown, but they 
were rather devastated by the 
time the day was over.
The profuse number of excel
lent posters carrying the pictures 
of the beautiful candidates con
tributed to making the campus a 
colorful place. As soon as the elec
tion was over, these pictures 
somehow disappeared.

Veterans Administration 
Does 4Swell Job9 for Vets
Friday afternoon at 4:30 P. M. 
all you veterans are cordially in
vited to attend monthly business 
meeting of the Tecvets. Yea, 
verily, you are even urged! The 
principal items on this table are 
plans for the next veterans dance 
and a talk by Colonel Vernet par
ticularly for Reserve Officers. The 
meetings are always open for any
thing you want to introduce.
The dance for which the plans 
are to be considered is a second 
edition of the successful dance 
held by the veterans last spring. 
It has already been decided that 
the proceeds of this affair are to 
go towards a fund for a memorial 
to Carnegie Tech men who died 
in the war.
Col. Vernet, assigned to a head
quarters in Pittsburgh which han
dles the Reserve Officers Corps in 
this area will give a review of the 
program for Reservists.
If you dont already know, you 
are hereby informed that: 
WHEREAS the Army of the Unit
ed States has performed gallant
ly its part, . . .; WHEREAS our 
Army continues in active service 
to the nation . . .; WHEREAS the 
Congress ... on March 16, 1937, 
has recognized April 6 of each 
year as Army Day: NOW, THERE
FORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, 
in order that we may give especial 
honor to our Army, to the Soldiers 
of World War II, and to the sol
diers of other wars, do hereby pro
claim Saturday, April 6, 1946, as 
Army Day.
It could be written in six words 
but youre getting it this way so 
itll really sound like Army Day.
Before you registered, did you 
wonder just how all the details of 
getting a G. I. education could 
ever be managed? How one ar
ranged to get the books paid for 
and all the rest of it? About all 
one had to do in the end was sign 
his name (at least 50 times)

ing a swell job to coin a phrase.
Saying' Veterans Center is al
most equivalent of saying Dr. 
Work. As head of the Veterans 
Center, Assistant Director of the 
College of Engineering and Sci
ence, and Chairman of the Fresh
man Committee, he just has 
enough leisure time to work a 
cross-w'ord puzzle now and then.
Dr. Work attributes the ability 
of executives and administrators 
in engineering fields to a consci
ousness of what is worth while 
and worthy of development. This 
ability often seems like intuition 
but is really a result of the scien
tific working of the subconscious 
mind, he believes. Great discover
ies are made by men with a large 
share of this subconsciousness, 
which suggests new theories to 
them where others see only in
explicable phenomena. Another 
example of the working of the sub
conscious mind is the way Dr. 
Work wakes up in the morning 
with the solution to his cross word 
puzzles.
Notice
Every organization which 
wishes to hold one of the an
nual all-school dances or to 
hold a closed affair should 
hand in their petitions for the 
desired affair by Friday, April 
26, to Student Council, Lucille 
Emmel, or Miss Orr. The ex
act date they wish is not 
necessary but may be request
ed. A proposed planned social 
calendar will be made this 
spring so that it can be pub
lished in the Student Hand
book and so that the social 
calendar will not be as crowd
ed as it was this year.
All organizations which re
ceive appropriations from or 
have their accounts under 
Student Council should sub

April 16. They may be given 
to Miss Orr in the Deans Of

---------------------------------------------------

an eight-month course at Duffs 
Iron City College. Last year Ginny was registered in the Intro
ductory Psychology course; this 
year, English Composition. Ginny has been employed for the past 
four years by the Eureka Casual
ty Company in the Compensation 
and Claims Department. After in
quiring a bit further, we find this 
complicated title means the de
partment which determines 
whether clients are entitled to 
compensation or claims for dam
ages.
Talking with Ginny for a short 
time convinces one that she is a 
victim of the wanderlust. She 
talks eagerly of her trips to Can
ada and Niagara Falls; but when 
you say Floridawell, just men
tion it to her someday and watch 
her beam! It was there that she 
spent her last two summer vaca
tions. As she talks of swimming, 
dancing, and baking in the sun, 
one can just tell that she is a real 
vacationist at heart. Florida, Gin
ny tells us, is the very essence of 
beautiful scenery and delightful 
weather.
St. Petersburg and Jacksonville 
were the cities at which she visit
ed while in Florida. Her hope is 
to go back someday to stay at Mi
ami. But before she returns to 
Florida, Ginny wants to travel 
West to either Colorado or Ari
zona. These states constitute her 
vacation plans for the ensuing 
summer.
Ginny is one of those tall, blue
eyed, blonds one always sees but 
never expects to be so friendly 
and warm. Her personality makes 
you feel so completely at ease that 
it is hard to believe that you have 
known her for only a short time. 
She is always ready to welcome a 
newcomer to Tech by telling them 
of the many advantages the school 
has to offer an Evening Student. 
Incidentally, she always take ad
vantage of these herself, very sel
dom missing a play or a Wednes
day night of swimming.
Sports, her first love, find a 
ready and willing enthusiast in 
Ginny. All kinds of sports are for 
her as long as they are outdoors. 
She is a baseball and volleyball 
fan, and enjoys a mushball game 
in which she can participate. Rid
ing is first rate with her  the 
Schenley and Riverview Stables 
her main choice. Techs pool pro
vides the scene for Ginnys win
ter swimming and North Park for 
summers outdoor swimming. Al
though Ginny bowls, she very 
modestly refuses to disclose her 
average!
Ginny likes to eat anything as 
long as it is chicken. As she sits in 
a restaurant widely known for its 
sea-food dishes, it seems strange 
to see her eating fried or creamed 
chicken. Spaghetti runs a close 
second to chicken with Ginny, and 
she claims Balbos cannot be beat
en-for this Italian dish.
We hope Ginny will continue 
coming to Tech for a long time in 
the future, for her being at the 
PLAID Friday nights always 
makes the atmosphere more 
cheerful, and the paper more suc
cessful.

Faculty Adds 
Paul Gustafson
In interviewing Paul Gustafson, 
one of the newer teachers on 
Techs faculty, we killed two birds 
with the proverbial sling-shot for 
his charming wife was also pre
sent and helped to fill in the cor
ners with information.
Instructor Gustafson could 
hardly be called new to Tech for 
he had taught here in 1942 pre
vious to entering the Air Corps, 
and now discharged, has returned 
to his former teaching position.
Paul was born and raised in 
Kane, Pa., then later moved with' 
his family to Columbus, Ohio, 
where he entered Ohio State, re
ceiving his degree in Civil Engi
neering in 1940. After two years 
association with Kansas Univer
sity and a summer semester at 
Ohio State, he came to Carnegie 
Tech.
An interesting sidelight into ro
mance is the fact that Mrs. Gus
tafson, then temporary secretary 
to the Mechanics Department 
upon her graduation from Mar
garet Morrison in 1940, wrote the 
letter for acting head, Prof. Thom
as that instigated the addition of 
her future husband to Techs staff;
The Gustafsons were married 
in 1944 and spent their honey
moon in Florida before Paul was 
inducted into the Army Air Corps, 
finding himself, two weeks after 
their return, again in Florida, tak
ing his basic training at Miami 
Beach. Later his wife joined him 
while in the College Training De
tachment at Stillwater, Oklahoma, 
claiming she lived as a typical 
army wife, washing clothes in the 
bathtub.
Most of Paul Gustafsons length 
of service was spent as an Air 
Crew Trainee, the wars ending 
prevented his going on with his 
flight training although he had 
previously held a civilian pilots 
license.
The Gustafsons now live with 
Anns people in Regent Square 
while conducting the usually 
fruitless search for an apartment, 
where she can exploit her inter
est in interior decoration.
When we asked Paul his hob
bies it was summed up into two 
headings; photography and air
planes. His favorite photographic 
subject is Ann, of course, (and we 
can readily see why) ' with air
planes next. They hope to find an 
apartment with a cubbyhole that 
can be converted into a darkroom. 
This amazing couple also like to 
bowl, but find that Instructor 
Gustafsons evening schedule too 
full to allow much of this hobby. 
Their predominant dream is their 
new cara canary yellow Plym
outh convertible which is already 
on order for them.
We tried to find a connection 
between Pauls family and his en
gineering interests, but although 
one of his brothers is a petroleum 
engineer, the other a forester, 
there has been no real influence 
except his . desires to follow this 
line in his teaching. This couple 
will have no trouble finding hap
piness with their pleasing person
alities. Good luck, Gustafsons!

Virginia Elmi
Virginia Ehni has been at Techs 
Evening School for two years, and 
in that time she has created for 
herself an impressive record. She 
has worked on the PLAID for 
both years. The first year she was 
a reporter; the second, Associate 
Editor. Ginny was appointed to 
Evening Student Council last 
year, this year she was elected 
Vice President. It is her duty to 
record points earned by Evening 
Students who work for evening 
activities. This is to determine 
who is worthy of receiving the 
Evening Student Council insignia 
awards given at the conclusion of 
each school year.
Ginny graduated from West 
View High where she studied 
commercial subjects. She contin
ued her commercial study during
moments of madness, William 
ODonovan of the Coraopolis 
O'Donovans, (known to his friends 
as O. D.), shaved off that soupstrainer. Ahem! Bye!
